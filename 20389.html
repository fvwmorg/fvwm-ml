<br />I spent probably 8 hours roving around in the code making improvements.
<br />
<br />Then realized that I was dealing with things that were all conceptually
<br />
simple and more trouble to fix within the existing framework than to replace.
<br />
<br />The code is very fragile and mostly unmaintainable.  Period.
<br />
<br />Several people have responded emotionally: &quot;But I like fvwm.&quot;
<br />
Fine.  I mostly like it too.
<br />
<br />But probably four others (some in direct email) have responded more directly
<br />
to my comments about the code and it's cruftiness: &quot;I totally agree with you.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.&quot;

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are so dissaticfied, then leave!  
</em><br />
<br />I am.  And I'm inviting other developers to come along and put their efforts
<br />
into another project that is going somewhere...as opposed to one that hasn't
<br />
managed to even assemble the patches sent to the mailing list in SIX MONTHS.
<br />
<br />Users should stay with fvwm2 as long as they like.
<br />
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You do not have to try to get everyone else mad about fvwm.  That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only causes people not to try to work with it and fix it up.  If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuse to be helpful, then just be quite!
</em><br />
<br />My advice to programmers that they look at the other window managers as a
<br />
starting point for improvement is given with the best of intentions.
<br />
<br />Fvwm2 development is for all intents and purposes stopped and dead.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, there is an fvwm2 variant (AfterStep) that seems alive and well.
<br />
<br />Also, there are two other promising WM projects (Enlightenment, and
<br />
WindowMaker) that have been totally rewritten and that have large and active
<br />
user-bases.
<br />
<br />Some people have suggested that fvwm 3.0 should be a complete rewrite.
<br />
Perhaps so, but it's reckless to embark on such an effort without carefully
<br />
looking at the other &quot;complete rewrites&quot; that are actively underway while
<br />
fvwm2.0.45 has been the &quot;current&quot; release SINCE JANUARY: dead by definition.
<br />
<br />I have been a relatively happy user of fvwm2.  I just don't see the point in
<br />
starting to write code for it.
<br />
<br />I don't even care if the guy doing Enlightenment is a little cranky and
<br />
doesn't bother to watch his spelling.  He's doing very cool work and the E
<br />
hackers are ambitious to the point of planning X11 extensions just to
<br />
achieve the Quality results (shaped window transparency for see-through
<br />
menus and icons) that they demand from their windowing environment...
<br />
<br /><br />Probably I've been preaching to the &quot;unconvertable,&quot; but I hope that you
<br />
[all] can accept this as a wake-up call and not a cop-out.
