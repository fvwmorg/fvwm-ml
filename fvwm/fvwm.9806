	The gnome group has posted the requested additions on the site,  and
are requesting any window manager to comply if they wish.

One person whome i'm currently working with has started a web page on
this very subject.  perhaps it could server as a clearing house?

I am beginning to suffer from acronym overload. I use fvwm2.

I downloaded scwm (touted as the successor to fvwm) but could not get it
to do button bars or a pager. Then I inquired about Enlightenment but
was told it was resource hungry compared to fvwm. Now I see conversation
about Gnome and how to do gnome-like things with fvwm. What is Gnome and
what are itst strenths & weaknesses?

More generally is there a path forward from fvwm2 that incorporates the
critical functions (button bars, pagers, menus) but does not chew up
more resources than fvwm2? Or should I ignore the static and just stick
with fvwm2? 

(I'm a little nervous. Previously I bet on Honeywell, Univac, OS/2 and
the Tandy 6000 :-(  )

I've seen a few other people posting "WIBNI" stuff, so I thought I'd add
in my $0.02 in case anyone's looking for things to do ... :)

 1) Module cleanup.  It seems to me that there're at least a few modules
    where functionality is overlapping.  I appreciate that people have
    different priorities, but it'd be really nice for new users if there
    was one module for each task... and it would be nice to get one
    really excellent module rather than 2 or 3 pretty good ones.  The
    "Console" variants in the extras directory leap immediately to mind.

 1a) As part of #1, get a shared library for fvwm modules.  Pack as much
     stuff into it as possible--this may mean generalizing some of the
     stuff currently available in only one or two modules.  Once we have
     automake/autoconf support, we can use libtool to make shared
     library support almost trivial.

 1b) Also as part of #1, it would be nice if more modules allowed
     separate config files, rather than requiring things in .fvwm2rc
     (like FvwmButtons does, for example).  Configs for some modules
     (like FvwmForm!) can grow very large.  Also, it's nice if you can
     change the file, then see the changes without having to restart
     fvwm (or using a Console program).

 2) New core feature for SmartPlacement: have SmartPlacement try extra
    hard to avoid overlapping windows tagged StaysOnTop.

 3) FvwmForm -- this is a MOST handy module, but it needs someone to
    work on new features.

      - Cut and paste !!! (especially paste!)
      - Keyboard accelerators
      - Dropdown lists
      - Some more conditionals for the command invocation; I'd like a
        trinary operator.  Or, maybe something like the shell variable
        queries.

      - Nice to have: ability to draw lines across the window; ability
        to include pixmaps; etc.

 4) FvwmButtons

      - Allow "compressed" buttons, where the buttons aren't uniform
        width (or height, for vertical bars), but rather just as wide as
        they need to be.  This is most important for swallowed items.

      - A "tool tips" or "balloon help" feature.

      - One FvwmButtons app managing multiple button bars (I think
        there's one per button bar now, right?)  Generally I would like
        all "stay alive" modules to manage multiple instances of
        themselves where that makes any sense.

Gee, it seems like there were other things, too...

CleverPlacement can already do that, although currently the parameters
that determine how hard it avoids certain types of windows is hard coded.
Once the style flags are fixed, this can be made configurable.  To enable
CleverPlacement, use the following line in your rc file:

GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

GentlePeople,
    I am trying to compile fvwm95(2.0.43.b) on a
Sun ULTRA
(Using the Sun-C Compiler) runing Solaris 2.5.1.
Everything runs
fine until I get to the FvwmTaskBar module source
directory. When
it compiles I get the following:

ld: fatal: file FvwmTaskBar: cannot open file;
errno=2
ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found
ld: fatal: File processing errors.  No output
written to a.out

Current working directory

WHAT GIVES???

Hi!

I'd like to execute "Maximize 0 100" on emacs when it is started.

Is there something like a "StartFunction" option to Style ?

An alternative would be to do this in the emacs init file. I use:

(defun hf-max-height ()
  "Use the full height of the screen."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((dh (x-display-pixel-height))
         (ch (frame-char-height))
         (linjer (/ dh ch))
         (ib (/ (1+ (% dh ch)) 2)))
    (set-frame-height (selected-frame) linjer)
    (modify-frame-parameters nil `((internal-border-width . ,ib)))))

Note that this functino assumes that emacs already has its upper edge a=
t
the top of the screen. You might want to use something like:

(modify-frame-parameters '((top . 0)))

Also, this height calculation assumes that emacs has no titlebar.

You might then combine something like this with a construction in .emac=
s
along the lines of:

(if window-system
    (...))

	  Exec ["hangon"] command

	  Since this gives nice feedback that something is happening,

	  My suggestion:

	    Action (Mouse 1, Hangon "Netscape", HangTime 30) \
		'warp-or-run Netscape /usr/local/bin/netscape'
	  
	  This would do the following, when mouse button 1 is pressed
	  on the specified button:

	  1.  Change the relief of the button to indicate that
	      something is happening.

	  2.  Execute the specified function (not necessarily an
	      Exec).  In this case, "warp-or-run" will either warp to
	      the specified window if it exists, or will run the
	      command if there is no Netscape window.

	  3.  Hangon "Netsacpe" -- When a new window called "Netscape"

Do you login via a text mode interface and then do a ``startx''?  If
yes, check your ~/.xinitrc. 

If you log in via a graphical interface, check your ~/.xsession.

One of these probably starts your WM.

I am assuming that you are logining on the graphical screen in that case 
there is an option menu on the interface which controls your session pull
it down and select openwindows

this forces a read of your .xinitrc instead of the system one.
so edit your .xinitrc to start fvwm.

good luck
Brad

I'm not sure about SCVWM except that it exists,  

Enlightenment is a Fvwm Hack ( a very nice one ) that
allow custom window frames shaped icons etc etc etc, resource hungry 
but very pretty, als some say that it can be hard to configure.
www.enlightenment.org

Gnome is not a window manager, it is a Desktop Suite, consisting of a
"taskbar", file manager
admin applications and productivity applications, ( they have ported fun
ones too :),  it
provides a consistant look and feel between apps, session management,
applets.  It has
no specific window manager base, Miquel uses olvwm, raster use
Enlightenment, I use fvwm with it.
www.gnome.org

Fvwm2 provides all of these, FvwmPager, FvwmButtons, and the menus are
configurable from the .fvwm2rc file..

This is, technically, not true anymore.  Enlightenment, in its first
incarnation was based on fvwm2.  However, since that time, it has
undergone a complete grounds-up rewrite, and is currently undergoing
another one.  So, while it originally was a fvwm hack, it is not any
longer. :)  Just a technicality.

SCWM is the most recent FVWM2 hack.... from what I can tell it basically
replaces the internel configuration language with the scheme language.

Enlightenment (E) originally started as an fvwm2 hack, but then was
rewritten completely from scratch... I know this because I can't make
heads or tails of the internal language :)

Are these commands included with RedHat 5.1? I installed it last night
with all the GNOME options, but I don't know where all the commands/stuff
is.

 Hi,

Is there anything besides the sample config file and the man
pages that will explain how to customize a window manager such as fvwm?

I in my .fvwmrc in the "set up the colors" section there is stuff like

HiBackColor            #c06077

StdBackColor           #60a0c0

etc ...


I know how to use the showrgb command and use the xcolors program to see
the various colors but I don't know how to interpret these alphanumeric
codes for colors nor do I know where to find a more complete list than
that given by showrgb, nor do I know what the numbers on the left are when
I give the showrgb command.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

i think these contain three components. Just like way in following.

240 255 255             azure1

They may be hex equivalent of the above interpretation.

I was thinking that that might be the case, but was not sure.
So what are the valid strings?

On my system it's /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt

I believe this is the same thing as the output of the showrgb command
except that the first line sais:

! $XConsortium: rgb.txt,v 10.41 94/02/20 18:39:36 rws Exp $

Neil

The colors are given in RGB (Red Green Blue) format, written in hexadecimal
(base 16).  Split the numbers into 3 sets of two and use a calculator that
does hex-to-decimal conversion to convert each 2 digit hex number to decimal
format.  This will give you 3 numbers, each from 0-255.  This should map to
showrgb numbers.

Or, to make things a lot simpler, I believe that you can use the name of the
color as given in the showrgb command in place of the hex number itself.

Hope this helps.

The problem with the color names given as output to the showrgb command is
that unfortunately not every color has a name so the list is incomplete in 
that sense.

 I'd like to have a couple options for sorting, controlled by module

WindowList to find lost windows, I suspect I'd like a 'sort alphabetical

formatting ala FvwmIconMan and an option to sort based on the results of
that.

| I've found that xv doesn't work properly with 24-bit packed visuals.

 This is probably not an issue of the visuals but of the supported
pixmap formats. XFree86 breaks away from a pack of other X servers in
supporting only a 3-byte 24-bit depth pixmap format when the display is
in packed-24bit mode, which causes problems with a number of programs
(including xanim, where I first saw this). Most other X servers
operating in this mode support a 4-bytes-per-pixel mode and do internal
4->3 conversion.

 I can confirm that xv is capable of working fine on a 24-bit-packed
display if there's a 4-byte-per-pixel pixmap format (I just tested it).

Hi,

I would like the feature of two dimensional menu bars to be incorporated in
fvwm.

The room I am writing from consists of 60 PCs or so, arranged acroos the room
in rows of 10, all networked of course. By using a menu bar I can have a window
pop up so that I can run a process on the machine I wish.
However, 60 entries don't fit well vertically and it would be nice if the 
menu I chise from was a 2 dimentional array, reflecting the arrangement of 
the PCs in the room.

Neil

I'd like to make a couple of queries and make a few observations -

I basically use a setup with a taskbar (based on fvwmbuttons) - most of
it double decked ('Start menu',clock and launch bar upper, swallowed
Iconman lower,Swallowed double height pppload,xload,pager,exit and lock
buttons to the Right.frvwm 2.0.46 (1280x1024,16bpp)XF3.3.2.1

Queries

This setup, along with the popup menues use a large quantity of mini
icons - I find that if there's to many windows open, the mini icons in
the icon man, and the icons in the title bars do not appear - I assume
this is hitting some kind of resource limit but where? Is this an X
problem?, an fvvwm problem? is there an answer?

2nd problem, I have the smart window placement on, I find windows
appear behind the taskbar (which being sticky/nohandles is a pain) - is
there anything that can be done to prevent this?

Observations

I have tried Afterstep, fvwm95, and have looked at several other
alternatives including Enlightenment (wince) and KDE - My setup as it
stands is very clean and unobtrusive, on screen, all that is normally
visible is the taskbar. Virtually all other window managers I've seen
(ok they're showing off the features) seen to waste acres of desk space
3d icons all over the place (which are always large, text titles,
ditto) - Am I in a minority of 1 in believing these people spend more
time admiring their desktops than doing anything useful with them ?
Unfashionable possibly but I see fvwm as 'serious' but without the
'heaviness' of motif or the rawness of some of the other older wms. 

Wishlist
Firstly one of the things I did like about Afterstep was the pop-out
button bars, can't recall what it was called but definitely less
clutter, a good idea.

Secondly I'd like to see Iconmanager have an option to do without the
titles - I'd rather just have icons, possibly with a 'bubble help' for
the text.

Thirdly there does seem to be a shortage of good mini-icons, lots of 3d
ones which in the small format are totally incomprehensible, but few
clear simple ones (sounds easy but I've tried it, it ain't).

Ideally I would like to be able to select alternative setups from a menu
(eg alternative button bar configs)

Simple suggestion - In addition to the usual Window ops, I'd like a
'Centre' command ie regardless of where an app currently is, minimised
or otherwise, raise it to the top and centre it on the current screen.

On the subject of Gnome,KDE and their ilk, (and indeed redhat and their
rpms and 'Another level' setup, I think that there are a lot of dangers
in going to mechanisms which abstract the users in the name of 'user
friendliness' - RPMs, user setup 'helpers' etc are fine, with one
proviso - namely one can turn the wretched things off, otherwise ones
going to simply reinvent Win95, fine if it works, if it doesn't, tough
noone can help because it's an inpenetrable morass. 
Fvwm is currently text file based, by Linux standards well documented
but possibly to a newbie a bit frightening - by all means add helpers,
but please make them output simple text files we can edit directly.

As for earlier discussions on Gnome and KDE, I think there are benefits
worth having in associating with one of the 2, my personal preference
being Gnome (OK I'll come clean, I'm just sick and tired of KDE
activists recommending KDE appps for every other query in
comp.os.linux.x regardless of how suitable they are...
comp.os.linux.advocacy.kde anyone?)

Cheers
Kim

Sounds like a reasonable idea. Does anybody want to take a stab at it?

Hi,

I would like to suggest a generalization of Emacs' follow mode
concept to fvwm. Most of you are probably already familiar with 
follow-mode <http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/follow.shtml>.
For those of you who are not, I will briefly explain the concept:

Two windows A and B are opened, both showing the same file, image,
or application. The bottom of window A is the top of window B.
Hence scrolling in window A causes window B to scroll as well.

We could have the same situation with N windows.

By opening enough windows one can get a better view of the application
they are looking at, and can also display full pages of postscript on
a small screen with no need for scroll bars.

Perhaps this is a somewhat strange though useful feature.
fvwm would be the first window manager to offer it.

Neil

   I assume the person taking on this task would make it
   configurable so that the menu items could be arranged in
   any number of columns (ie. not limited to 2 columns).    :-)

   Other than that sounds like a good idea,

Of course.
Any number of rows and columns would have to be aloowed. :-)

That is deliberate.  The number of colors in use is limited, typically
to 256.  A shorter list of color names encourages sharing of colors
between applications.

BTW the #RGB style of color specification is deprecated.  Numeric
specification of colors should be done with something like rgb:.
See the man page for XParseColor or a book on X11 such as the Xlib
Programming Manual.

Are these really needed?  Existing menus can be organized in a number
of ways including

   1) Upper menu of 6 choices leading to lower menus of 10 choices
      each.
   2) Menus with 11 choices of 10 leaves and More.

(2) can quickly fill your screen if that is what you seek, especially
if the More button is at the top of the list.

Alternatively an instance of FvwmButtons may be a better approach to
managing the 60 PC's.  That may be iconized or kept in its own desk.

What other people have said is true, so to sum up...

colours specified by #c06077 etc are RGB specified. It breaks down
like this:

#rrggbb

where rr is the hexadecimal form of a number between 0 and 255 which
defines the amount of red in the colour. being hexadecimal means
instead of going 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,....etc  it goes
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f,10,11,12, so 10 in hexidecimal is
actually 16 in decimal. 3b in hexidecimal is 3*16+11 (b=11).


the gg, and bb are just the same as rr but specify the amounts of
green and blue repectively. Hope this makes sense..

Yes but this would mean I would have to create menus called row 1,
row2, ..., row 6. Plus I would like to see some horizontal menus
as well since they would reflect better the way the PCs are arranged 
throughout the room.

The More button? Please introduce me to this feature.

I don't have this in my man pages either. You must be running fvwm2.

My shorthand for a menu entry labeled "More ..." or similar which pops

As are most of the subscribers to this list, I suspect.  GoodStuff was
the rough equivalent of FvwmButtons in fvwm1.

The point was that a menu is rather limiting for what you may want to
do.  It would allow you to do just one action.  You can configure
FvwmButtons to lay out the 60 buttons however you see fit, perhaps
with extra blank buttons to match the physical topography.  You would
then have the option to assign different actions to different mouse
buttons and modifiers.  Indeed you could do something like swallow an
xload for each PC into its button.

What is it that limits the number of colors to 256? I guess you are 
referring to the video card. If I am correct you can configure some video 
cards to allow for 56K colors (true color). This is somehow less much less 
than 256^3 which is the total number of possibilities for RGB colors.

And is it possible to have different FvwmButtons applications, say two,
on the same desktop.
Also, can FvwmButtons launch another FvwmButtons onto the desktop, ie.
can we have nested FvwmButtons?

Thanks,

It's the video card, the amount of video RAM and the X driver that limits you
to 256 colours (or 8 bit depth as it's called). Look in your XF86Config file
for details (assuming that you're using XFree86).

BTW true colour is not 56k colors, 8-bit depth gives 256 colours, 16-bit depth
gives 65536 colours, while 24-bit depth gives the full range of 16 million
colours (in 24-bit depth, there are 8 bits available for each red, green or
blue component, and of course 2**8 = 256).

Yes.  More efficiently, a button may be a Container which simulates
one FvwmButtons module within another.

Yup.  I do it all the time.  I have one instance called
"TaskBarButtons" (my task bar) and another one called "XtermButtons".

You just simply need to call the buttons some name:

	Module FvwmButtons XtermButtons

and then give the properties by name:

    *XtermButtonsFore		Black
    *XtermButtonsBack		#c0c0c0
    *XtermButtonsFont		-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-*-70-*-*-*-*-*-*
    *XtermButtonsGeometry	-1-31
    *XtermButtonsColumns	4

    *XtermButtons(4x8, Swallow "Fvwm Pager" "FvwmPager 0 3")
    *XtermButtons(Size 34 10, Title system1, 
	    Action 'Exec rsh sys1 /usr/bin/X11/xterm -ls -display $HOSTDISPLAY')
    *XtermButtons(Size 34 10, Title sys2, 
	    Action 'Exec rsh sys1 /usr/bin/X11/xterm -ls -display $HOSTDISPLAY')
    *XtermButtons(Size 34 10, Title sys3, 
	    Action 'Exec rsh sys1 /usr/bin/X11/xterm -ls -display $HOSTDISPLAY')
    *XtermButtons(Size 34 10, Title quit, 
	    Action 'Next [CirculateHit "XtermButtons"] Close')


This gives a nice little button block that consists of a pager and
four buttons underneath it, including a QUIT button that causes the
XtermButtons to close.  The geometry (-1-31) makes it sit on the
bottom right corner, just above my TaskBarButtons.

> Also, can FvwmButtons launch another FvwmButtons onto the desktop, ie.
> can we have nested FvwmButtons?

A button on FvwmButtons can launch another set of buttons.

For instance:

    *XtermButtons(Size 34 10, Title "Other...", 
	    Action 'Module FvwmButtons OtherButtons')

Or, a set of buttons can be included within a set of buttons using the
"Container" keyword.  See the man page for FvwmButtons that comes with
fvwm-2.0.46.

Sorry about that, I didn't bother to RTFM.  FvwmButtons currently
allows one action per mouse button only.  That action may to be pop up 
a menu, so you can effectively bind many things to one button.

Hi,

How can I launch multiple applications through the menu bars (for
example three xterms covering my window workspace)?

Also, how can I have a maximized window pop up from a menu without having
to use the monitor size dependant geometry options.

Thanks,

Neil

Near 2000, Neil Zanella mumbled something about:
>

> example three xterms covering my window workspace)?

Make a function for it.
Something like
AddToFunc foo
"I" xterm -geometry .....
+ "I" xterm -geometry ...
etc.

And then
AddToMenu Whatever "Foo" Title
+ "3 xterms" Function foo

> Also, how can I have a maximized window pop up from a menu without having
> to use the monitor size dependant geometry options.

For a window called foo, something like
Next [foo] Maximize 100 100

Hope this helps.

The only way I can see to do this is with FvwmScroll, and I don't know how
well it would work.

Very true.

If you wish to manually convert the numbers, look at them from a base 16
perspective.  I.e., each digit represents a power of 16.  So for a 2 digit hex
number, like a4, do the following:

#a4 = a * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0 = 10 * 16 + 4 * 1 = 164 decimal

hex numbers are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f

It's a bit tricky going the other direction (dec to hex), but fairly straight
forward with only three decimal digits.  To convert from dec to any other base,
use the remainder method.  E.g., to go from 200 dec to hex, do the following:

200/16 = 12 remainder 8
12/16 = 0 remainder 12, and 12 in hex is c
therefore, 200 dec = c8 hex

Hope this helps.

I don't think this is an FvwmScroll issue, I  think the request is for
something like:

# Keypad 3 key w. control scrolls 2 windows:
Key KP_3 W C Scroll2windows

AddToFunc Scroll2windows "I" GenerateXEvent "scroll-forw"
+ "I" Next [?] GenerateXEvent "scroll-forw"

Of   course there is  no  Fvwm2,  "GenerateXEvent",  and how you would
figure out which other window had to be scrolled isn't clear (to me).

Or, instead  of generating an X  Event, the keystroke  could be passed
thru to  both  windows.  (FWIW, generating X   Events and passing thru
keystrokes are not things I'm particularly knowledgable about.)

Hi, 

I am glad to hear that perhaps it would be possible to add this feature to fvwm 
and that it seems doable. Plus, I think some people would find it handy.

Well, the two or more windows related by this follow-mode like feature (I leave the name of the feature up to the devloper) would have to change to the same
frame color as defined by HiBackColor when the mouse points to either one of 
them. Selecting either of the multiple windows will then be equivalent.

As far as starting the windows that use this feature, this could either be
done by making a selection from the menus or by using an Fvwm Module wheeby
by selecting the module through the menu, pointing to the desired window,
and then clicking, would result in a second related window of the same frame
color.

Sounds good to me.

I usually have many windows opened at once, like mutiple rxvt's,
netscape's, etc. They have the same names and it was a pain to find
the one that I wanted. This patch will sort the buttons according to
the X coordinates of the centers of the windows. Now a window on
the left of the screen will have its button on the left, and a window
on the right will have its button on the right. This patch makes my
life much easier. I've been using it for a month and haven't found any 
problems yet.

Enjoy

The colors are indeed carelessly listed.
What bothers me the most is that some colors have multiple entries whereas 
others don't. Here is part of my showrgb output:

Note that "snow" appears once, "ghostwhite" appears twice as "ghost white"
and "GhostWhite", and "slategray" apperas four times as "slate gray", "SlateGrey", and then once more "slate grey", and "SlateGrey".

255 250 250             snow
248 248 255             ghost white

255 250 240             floral white
...                     ...

Also, the entries should be displayed in alphabetical order (why not)?

I suggest that the showrgb database be modified to make more sense.

Kin,

This isn't a window managers issue but an X server question.

Try "xset b 0 0 0", most X servers will accept it, otherwise "man xset" and
look for bell volume.

Good Luck,
Yehuda.

I don't think that beeping has to do with fvwm at all.
In an xterm, type xset -b or xset b off or man xset.
Also, other than the bell there is the clicking too 
which you may find annoying. If you are lucky then you
may disable clicking with the xset command as well.

p.s. I hate that bells as well.

Hi,

I need some help guys. May I did something stupid. On any xterm, I used
get those "Main Options", "VT Fonts", and "Another I do not remember"
when I press CTRL and other three mouse keys. Now I see a small window
where I see only the part of the heading and nothing else.

Can you think of any mistake I made ?

Yes.  You probably have a `*geometry' resource set for xterm like:

    xterm*geometry: 80x40

This will affect the geometry of the vt100 window (the one most folks
use), the menus, and the tektronix window (the one most folks don't
care about), as you have discovered.  Instead, you should use:

    xterm*vt100.geometry: 80x40

That will only affect the vt100 window, and won't affect the menus or
the tektronix window.

Will an fvwm config file run under fvwm2 after an upgrade?
That is, is there any upward compatibility from going from fvwm1 to fvwm2?

Thanks,

Neil

These all appear multiple times because the spelling of the color is different in each occasion.  showrgb gives the mapping between RGB
codes and the various names for those colors.  For example, if you want to use the color "ghost white," you may specify this with
"ghost white" or "GhostWhite" (no spaces in the latter).  The color names are not just descriptions of the color, they can be used in
place of the RGB code to specify the color within .fvwmrc or html files or whatever.

Not even close :)

However, there is a conversion script in fvwm2 that (attempts to)
convert fvwm1 config files into fvwm2 format.

People here have reported varying degrees of success, but it'll get you
more than 50% there, for sure :)

   Why?!?

   I like to have the choice to type "slategray" on Tuesdays and
   "SlateGray" on every Saturday, not to mention my Wednesday
   habbit to type "slate grey" and my ritual of typing
   "SlateGrey" every 2nd Monday of the month.

   So unless you want to make the parser for the RGB db accept
   *and* understand all the different ways of representing a
   colour using english text... don't bother!

   Why again?  Do you visit this file so often that you need
   to have it in alpha order?

   If you are concerened about finding certain text in there
   and do not want to be scrolling up and down so much, then
   I must wonder why you are not using '/usr/bin/grep' to list
   the entries for you?

   Just my 2 cents on the matter,   :>

P.S.  Also see `man sort' for more options to sort your `showrgb'
      output.

Hi,

I don't want to make a big deal out of this and I think it's OK to have the 
choice of whether to type "wHATevErColor" or "whatever CoLoR" though I would
like to see some consistency in the datafile. I just thought that the output
of showrgb looked sloppy since some entries are listed in both uppercase and 
lowercase and some are not. This hints to the novice that there are some 
differences between the ones that are listed twice and the ones that aren't.
Perhaps some of you don't agree with me that the output of rgb is sloppy.
Mine was only a minor suggestion: if no one modifies it to look better I can 
certainly live with that and shall fuss no more ;-) .

Best regards,

Neil

Actually, as someone already pointed out, Ghost White and ghOsT WHITe work as
well.

Hi,

What's the most stable version of fvwm after 1.24r?

Thanks,

Sometime in the late 1900s you typed:

> What's the most stable version of fvwm after 1.24r?

   2.0.46 works fine for me at home and at work.

   Good luck,

Patrick K.

P.S.  I find that FvwmButtons once in a while will quit on
      me but other than that the wm seems quite stable.

Hi,

I am finding very little on the meaning of the font entries of the Font command.

BTW, is it possible when running an Xterm to change the size of the font without compromizing the size of the window?
This would definitely be an asset I'm looking for.

Thanks,

Neil

Hi,

Is it possible to have the pager appear within GoodStuff or in Fvwm2 within
Fvwm Buttons. This would reduce the clutter of having different objects on 
the desktop.

Thanks,

Hi,

    I'm running fvwm 2.0.46 on an SGI Indy (IRIX5.3). I can't run some
programs from either the fvwm menus or FvwmButtons. 

>From my ~/.fvwm2rc:

*FvwmButtons(Title "-", Icon xfm_draw.xpm,\
    Action `Exec /usr1/misc/bin/ivtools/idraw &`)

*FvwmButtons(Title "-", Icon info.xpm,\
    Action `Exec /usr1/misc/bin/tk/tkinfo &`)

*FvwmButtons(Title "-", Icon xpaint.xpm,\
    Action `Exec /usr1/misc/bin/xpaint &`)

*FvwmButtons(Title "-", Icon xv2.xpm,\
    Action `Exec /usr/local/bin/xv &`)

Xpaint and XV work fine - idraw and tkinfo don't even start up (if I use
the hangon extension to Action the button stays depressed). They all work
from the command line. I've tried different permissions and program
locations - nothing helps.

    Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    Thank you!

        Alan

1. At least some X applications that I've encountered over the years
   don't accept color specifications with spaces in them. From thens
   cometh "Slate Grey", "slategray", etc.

2. If rgb.txt must be sorted, it probably makes more sense to sort it
   on the values rather than the text (ie, it makes more sense to me
   for "off white" and "old lace" to appear between "white" and
   "yellow" than between "orange" and "purple".

3. showrgb dumps the table. If you don't like the output, 
   perl/sed/awk/grep/cut are your friends. TTWWDTIU.*

4. This isn't exactly the right forum for discussing the organization
   of X color name to value mapping. rgb.txt and showrgb are part of
   X, not fvwm; last I looked, fvwm2 ran fine on a mono server.

Based on this, and your earlier questions concerning color maps, I'd
recommend that you find O'Reilly's book "X Toolkit Intrinsics
Programming Manual for Version 11." Appendix B covers colors and
fonts. It's number 4 in their X series. My copy is orange.

This reinforces my point that consistency helps avoiding compatibility issues.

This is what I intended to suggest in the first place.

Sure, I wonder why whoever made the table wasn't friends with them.
If I had root permissions I'd probably use these tools to change the table
except for I don't feel it's worth it when I'm only doing it on my sytem.
That's the responsability of the person who made up the table. If I ever 
will need to make a table be reassured that it will look nice.

OK, I just could not find anything on the colors in man fvwm, that's all.
My own room is a complete mess, and I couldn't care less, but I do believe 
in keeping Unix neat and tidy. ;-)

I thought those volumes were way out of date. Plus I think most of them
are closely related to Motif, which is not freely distributable.

Hi,

I would like to be able to be able to click/unclick something in fvwm to
choose between having my workspace act as separate screens or as one big screen
with scrolling. Perhaps this could be achieved through some sort of pushbutton on 
the buttons or on the wharf.

Thanks,

Neil

Can I configure my .fvwmrc to have an entry in the pop-up menu sying
"switch to fvwm2" that will work by using the fvwm2 program on the remote

Hi,

I am trying to get a function to do the following.

I click on the toolbar, the window moves with the mouse, when I unclick
the window raises. Note that the raise is done after the movement and not 
before.
Is this possible? I'm sure it's very simple and I'm still hacking.

Neil

Hi,

Here is the bug:

One of the window buttons's behavior is defined by the following code:

Mouse 1         4       N       Maximize 0 100
Mouse 2         4       N       Maximize 100 0
Mouse 3         4       N       Iconify

... so I open an xterm and clcik with mouse button 1 on window button 4.
The window becomes tall as expected. Then I click with mouse button 2 on
window button 4. The window shrinks back to the origial size. I have to
click again with mouse button 2 on window button 4 to maximize it horizontally.

I thought it should work as follows:

clicking Mouse button 1 should maximize vertical, and then clicking 
Mouse button 2 should maximize horizontal so that the combined action should
be a "Maximize (both horizontally and vertically)".

The same error happens with the following entry:

Mouse 0		2	N	Maximize

I click mouse 0, button 2 and then  mouse 1 button 4. Instead of shrinking
and giving me the horizontal window it restores to the original size.

Either this is a bug or I am missing something.

Thanks,

Neil

You're missing something.  Maximize switches between a `maximized' state
and a `normal' state, whether or not it has arguments.  If you maximize
a window vertically, the next Maximize unmaximizes it, as you've
discovered.

For symptoms check your error log, which may be called xdm-errors.  If 
you can't find it, alter your startup file (.xsession or whatever) to
send the messages to a known place.

    fvwm2 > ~/fvwm2.log 2>&1

Alternatively at the start of .xsession.

    exec > ~/xsession.log 2>&1


A common cause of programs running from the command line but not under
a window manager is lack of environment variables.  I find it useful
to be able to dump fvwm's environment with a entry in the Quit-Verify
menu in .fvwm2rc.

+              "Dump environment" Exec set > $HOME/fvwm.env

This can be compared against "set" run from the command line.

there's a dirty hack to get 7 functions per button (posted several times)
hopefully, someone will make it a feature.

My only problem is, how to remember them.

You will find a marked improvement in speed between the first and second
functions below (the second one being much faster):

DestroyFunc	"RaiseAndFocus1"
AddToFunc	"RaiseAndFocus1"
+ "I"	Iconify -1
+ "I"	Raise

DestroyFunc	"RaiseAndFocus2"
AddToFunc	"RaiseAndFocus2" \

 Hello,
 I am trying to setup a PC running Linux 2.0.30, with AccceleratedX v4.1
 for the Display Server and fvwm for the Window Manager. 
 I have been having problems with mouse motion : it often happens that
 the computer hangs when I move the mouse. Anybody knows this problem ?
 I use /dev/psaux for the mouse driver, and it works fine with other
 window managers.
 One thing I wondered : I used a copy of fvwm compiled on another PC
 running Linux 2.0.28 and using X Display server. Should I recompile
 fvwm on the newer PC ? Should I define Xaccel somewhere in fvwm
 configuration ?
 Any other idea ?
 Thanks,
 Irene

Hi,

I would like to have a pager that does the following.

At first it acts normal, just as if I had 9 screens.

I click a button and it acts as if I have one screen, 9 times a s big.

I click back and the borders reappear on the pager and I have 9 screens again.

The stuff on the desktop should remain unaffected by this process.

Is this already possible or am I just making a suggestion for improvement?

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

As far as I am concerned, you will have to quit X and do an rsh/remsh/whatever_
the_remote_command_is_on_your_machine to start fvwm2 on the other machine with
the -d (display) option.

Hope this helps,

I have had the same problem on an SGI.
The only things I can think of are VERY ugly solutions, but at least they work...

First, try not doing an exec command directly but start a function instead,
in which you start the program with an exec.

If that doesn't help, make a script file in your home directory (I told you it
was going to be ugly !) that starts the program and call this from within Fvwm.

VERY strange problem, though.
On my machine, it just disappeared after a while.
Does anybody know what's happening here ???

Hope this helps,

you need to have a function that will allow you to quit fvwm, then rsh (exchanging xauth)
to the remote machine, perhaps copy the desired fvwmrc file over and run fvwm.
you could prolly do this with a script on the other machine.

hope this helps, it's not impossible just difficult.

I generally recommend the use of the 'xsession' program, which you can
obtain from any X ftp mirror.

This is a simple client which you run as the last program in your X startup
script (.xinitrc, .Xclients, .xsession, or whatever) instead of the
window manager.

xsession starts the window manager for you, then provides a menu of
different window managers to switch between. I find it very useful
to debug different versions of fvwm. It also make a great failsafe ...
if you mess up your fvwmrc and fvwm fails you will still get the
xsession window, and can switch to twm or something else, fire up
an editor, fix the fvwmrc, and test it.

When you want to leave X, just quit the xsession program.

You could set it up with menu entries for:

  fvwm
  rsh host fvwm2
  twm

and so on.

Are the entries you get with ctrl-mouse buttons(s) on an xterm configurable?
Are they configurable vi the .fvwm2rc file?
(those that say Main Options, VT Options, VT Fonts)?

Thanks,

Neil

I think so.

No.  You need to set these using X resources (in your .Xdefaults file,
or perhaps somewhere else, depending).  Look for a file XTerm, in
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, /usr/X11/lib/app-defaults, or somewhere
similar.

Hi,

I am on a small LAN with NFS.
Suppose I install fvwm in my home directory.
Will I then be able to run it from anywhere I want or
will I still have a problem since in reality my home directory
will be located on a remote machine, except for there is NFS?
Will I be able to run fvwm from any PC/X Terminal on campus?

Thanks,

you will not have aproblem running it from your home directory at all as
for running it on an machine that depends, if they are all the same
architecture then there should be no problem.  if they are different
architectures then you will need one binary and set of modules for each
platform.

But what about if I use a true dummy X Terminal?
What happens then? Can I still run fvwm from my home directory.
For example, if i open a "new telnet" window then can I just run it by typing "exec fvwm"?

A window manager is just an X client like any other. So if you have
your X terminal set up correctly and can display things like xterm and
xclock on it, then yes, you should be able to display fvwm too.

In fact, some X terminals have their own window manager in the firmware
(for example, ncdwm is a stripped down mwm on NCD terminals). They
are made available as a way of reducing load on the host running your
X clients. However, there is no requirement to use such a wm.

P.S. Note to fvwm folks. I am seeing a lot of questions around here
from newbies that have a hard time figuring out what is going on with
all the disparate components of X. I get similar questions from my
users at work. I certainly remember being an X newbie myself and trying
to figure out what the hell was going on with my HP machine: which of my
.mwmrc, .Xdefaults, .xinitrc, etc etc, files I needed to change to achieve
certain results.

So I'm thinking of writing a FAQ to cover such things. What is X, what's
the terminology, what are the common WMs and their config files, and
where to find the answers to all this stuff. Does anyone have pointers
to similar projects that I can work from?

Like I don't have enough stuff to do already :-)  Sigh ...

I have a feeling that fvwm cannot help me select the font for my xterms.
Am I correct?
That is, the only way to specify what fonts an xterm will use is to give the xterm/remoteXterm command the right argument.

I don't have a man entry on remoteXterm.

Is this part of fvwm or is it just a unix command?

I use it to pop up my xterms from the window manager.

Is it possible to use it to pop up xterms on another LAN

by having it log in for you somewhere where your password is

different for instance?

Thanks for any help,

Hi,

I am using the Maximize/Maximize vertical functions in fvwm but when
I type them it seems like my windiws get almost maximized vertically but
not quite. Usually I use text based Xterms.

Is this some sort of bug in fvwm?

Thanks,

Neil

Dude, read the xterm man page.  You can set resources in your
~/.Xdefaults file to specify the default font for xterm. 

Man pages are your friend.  Please use them before asking questions
here.

Probably not. I see the same thing and never regarded it as a bug.
Anyway, since xterm uses fixed-width fonts, its geometry
characteristics aren't done by the pixel, but rather by character
columns and rows. Doing a maximize 0 100 (for example) on an xterm
will make it as tall as it can be without growing beyond the desktop
size. This usually leaves a spare pixel or ten.

You can get XTerm menus by holding down the Control Key and pressing buttons 1, 2 or 3.

Button 3 will give you a font selection menu, which you can customize in /usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm

You can customize 6 fonts I think, plus the default you specified on the command line.

FVWM wouldn't have anything to do with xterm, as far as the system is concerned FVWM is just another program like xterm. It
only handles decorations for the window borders, and modules for other features. It can't normally change features of other
programs I don't think.

---

By the way, this has got to still be the best WM. It's still the easiest to configure. After using all the others, it's still
the only one that does everything I want. Kudos to the developers over the years and the countless hours of work they've done
to bring us something we can actually use. =)

xterms wont maximize fully because xterm windows only resize by steps of
character size. If you want it to fill the whole screen you'll have to try
values like 101 instead of 100, etc and/or change the border size.

Correct, for all applications. In general the window manager does the
following things:

1. Draw borders around windows.
2. Allow resizing and movement of windows.
3. Allow iconifying of windows.
4. Provide other services, such as menus, button bars, virtual desks, etc.

The window manager doesn't affect what happens *inside* the window. That
is up to the application itself.

Or set the X resource. I have the following in .Xdefaults:

XTerm*font: -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-12-120-*-*-m-*-iso8859-1


This is read when X starts up, or can be reloaded by:

  xrdb -load .Xdefaults

Thanks,

That was quite a neat trick.

There are quite a lot of dot files on the unix tree and their function is not at all 
that clear to me. All of this must be documented somewhere better than man.
Perhaps I will get myseld one or more of O'Reilly's X manuals.
I'm sure I would find them quite useful.
What I don't know is whether they will answer all of my questions or not.

Thanks,

Yes. This is exactly the sort of question I plan to answer in my proposed
FAQ.

The O'Reilly X manuals are very good, but are generally aimed at programmers.

Probably not at your level. You need an intro to X, what it is and does,
some terminology, and what some of the more common programs do. Again,
this is what my FAQ will achieve, I hope. You can be a beta tester :-)

I am certainly not an expert on this type of thing, but there is a nice little 
book entitled "Getting Started with UNIX and X" by Torbjorn Andreasson and Jan 
Skansholm (Addison-Wesley, 1994) that does a nice job of introducing the X 
system to new users.  It also has documentation in it on the "dot" (aka hidden) 
files.  There are many others but this might be a nice starting place.

Hi,

In FvwmButtons is it possible to have the butttons be different sizes or must they all be the same like
in GoodStuff?

Further, is FvwmButtons just a renaming of GoodStuff or does it actually have new features?

Thanks,

        startx is just a small shell script that will invoke xinit, 
which will start up the X server and also run another little shell 
script called xinitrc. xinitrc is typically used to start up a few
X clients, including your window manager. This is the guy you need
to change. I don't know where it's kept on FreeBSD systems - maybe
someplace like /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/ - look around for it.

        Somewhere near the bottom of xinitrc you should see a line 
that invokes whatever window manager you're currently using, so change
that to invoke fvwm (or fvwm2) instead.


        If you want to get a little fancier, you can replace the line
that starts your WM with a small loop that will keep your X session 
(and all your apps, usually) alive in case you accidentally terminate
your WM, and allow you to recover. Here's a snippet from my xinitrc 
that I've used for years:

WM="fvwm2"
while [ "$WM" != "Quit" ]
do
  $WM
  WM=`xmessage -name "Quit X" "Really quit, or restart WM?" \
  -buttons "Quit,fvwm2,olvwm,piewm,9wm,kwm" -print`
done

        In this example, the other WM choices are simply various window
managers that do not interact gracefully with FVWM's Restart function.
You might want instead to give yourself a choice of restarting FVWM or
your old WM, in case FVWM isn't set up properly and fails to come up
on the first try. Good luck!

Hiya Charles,

Sometime in the late 1900s you asked:

> I have downloaded the fvwm port from the freebsd ftp site, but I do not know 
> how to get it to load when I run startx.  I know that I'm missing something 
> simple, but I have worked on this for several hours with no success, any 
> suggestions?

   1. Check to see if there is `.xinitrc' in your home directory?

   2. If 1 yeilds true

      A. Edit the file and see what is the last line in there.
         It should be some sort of a wm.

      B. If A yeilds true

         i. Make a BACKUP of it.
        ii. Change it to "fvwm"
       iii. You are done.  exit(0);

      C. If A yeild false

         i. Make a BACKUP of it.
        ii. Try adding "fvwm" to the end of it.
       iii. Try running startx and see if it works.
        iv. You are done.  exit(0);

   3. If 1 yeilds false

      A. There is a system default `xinitrc' file that is getting
         executed.
         I am not sure where this would be on a freeBSD system.
         On Linux it is in:

            /var/X11R6/lib/xinit/xinitrc

      B. Copy it to your home directory under the name of `.xinitrc'.

      C. Go to step 2.A


   Hope this helps,

Patrick K.

Hi,

Is it possible to use the arrow keys and the other buttons on the keypad on the 
right side of the keyboard to simulate a mouse in fvwm? This would be great
for speedy use of the window manager. It would be in my opinion a really nice 
feature.

Hello,

With modifier as 'M', I do not see my WindowList menu at all; I tried
all combinations like CTRL+mouse 2, CTRL+ALT+mouse 2 etc., Am I doing
something wrong ?

	Mouse 1     R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop
	Mouse 2     R       M       WindowList
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I cannot get this working at all.
	Mouse 2     R       A       Menu RouterConsoles1
	Mouse 3     R       A       Menu SamApps Nop

You are damn right sir. I reversed the order worked fine with ALT.
That is really strange. I am using fvwm2 2.0.46.

Thanks a lot.

I just started running fvwm on solaris 2.6.
Every xx number of minutes the monitor will shut down, until a mouse or key
movement. It didn't happen on my sparc station running 2.5.
How do I stop that?

Also any good screen saver sites?

What version of fvwm are you running?

Have you read the fvwm or fvwm2 man page?

Have you specifically read about "Maximize"?

Taking  a  guess at  what you  are  trying to   accomplish, if you are
running  fvwm2.0.46, you may  want to read the  man pages for FvwmTile
and FvwmCascade.

Hi,

Has anyone taken up the task of developing a follow-mode like feature for
the window manager?

<http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/follow.shtml>

To summarize, the feature should work as follows:

A single command opens up multiple windows (say n windows).

The windows are all related to each other as they all show the same file

The very top line of window k follows immediately from window k-1 and

scrolling one window k will scroll window k+1 as well. To select the n

related windows with the mouse it suffices to select one of them.

All related windows get the same HiForeColor and HiBackColor when the mouse 

points to one of them whereas the other unrelated windows act as usual with

with respect to color.



Is anyone implementing this in fvwm? It would be a nice feature.

This would add a follow-mode like feature to every application running 

within fvwm. That the feature won't have to be incorporated into every single

program that needs it (like the various editors, pagers, postscript viewers,

etc...)


Best wishes,

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

I think somebody posted this a few days ago. Does anybody else
understand this concept or why it would be useful? And anyway, I think
it has to be at the application level, not the window manager level.

Yeah, if I understand it, imagine opening something like Netscape that
takes half your screen top to bottom:


    +------------------+
    | +-----+          |
    | |     |          |
    | |     |          |
    | |     |          |
    | |     |          |
    | +-----+          |
    +------------------+

The request is to allow making Netscape think that it is twice as tall
as it is, and then take the 'bottom' half and move it to the right:


    +------------------+
    | +-----+ +-----+  |
    | |Top  | |Bottom  |
    | |     | |     |  |
    | |     | |     |  |
    | |     | |     |  |
    | +-----+ +-----+  |
    +------------------+

I don't think you can do that without running Netscape in a virtual
frame buffer and then ripping apart things for the real server.
It's not really a Window manager thing to solve.  (And, gads, it would
get confusing real fast: think of scrollbars and how scrolling up would
move from the right window suddendly to the left...)

Sure every feature has it's drawbacks. I don't think it would be that confusing
altogether if one knows what they're doing. Myself, I don't use _all_ of the 
options that come with fvwm. I just use the ones that would be handy to me.
Just like I don't use the "stay on top" option with all objects I could 
restrict using this option with text editors only or so.

Well, if it were at the application level then every single application would 
have to write code to do the same stuff. The philosophy of Unix was:
"small is beautiful" so in view of that it would be nice to have a feature in
the window manager that filters the output of whatever application one wishes.
Even if it is not a window manager feature there should be a program that lets 
you do it with any window. And the window manager is what deals with windows.
Analogously, just cause "less" is there that doesn't mean that it is reasonable 
to pipe the output of every single program through "less".

   This very same question has been asked many times before
   in many different formats.  A simple search in the fvwm2
   archives should've located a fitting answer to the question.
   Search for "changing background" and you should have an
   example of how to do this.

   Also see 'man xsetroot' and 'man xv'  both of these programs
   can be used to do what you want.

Who knows how FVWM implements screen text selection,
copy & pasting via the mouse?

In which module FVWM does these functions?

Thx!

Selection is  managed by X,  and the applications.  Fvwm  doesn't come
into it.

Neil,
  I think this is the  second time  you  have asked this question.   I
don't think  you have convinced anyone  that there  is a pressing need
for this.  In your original description  of "follow-mode" you referred
to   the  [X]Emacs  "follow-mode"  package.   Since  the functionality
required is already in [X]Emacs, why aren't you using that?

This description  of the functionality  you want is markedly different
than the way I described  what you wanted last  week.  Yet you haven't
clarified either description.

(My  description  required virtual   (synthetic)  keystrokes and  some
method of window pairing, this description creates virtual windows.)

I suggest that you will first have to  describe what you want clearly,
then you will have to  convince someone that the  feature is so useful
that they will use it enough to pay back the time invested.

Perhaps  if you   went  into more detail  about  the  problem  you are
having...

Fvwm has a lot of great features, but the best part is that anyone can
change the source code.

Why? Because I want to do the same thing with vi and the various vi clones
and don't like the viper vi implementation that comes with Emacs that
much. Plus, with Emacs (I never used Xemacs but Emacs which I have used
can run in X mode or text mode) you can use follow-mode within a same
FVWM window but you can't use follow mode amongst separate windows.

You can have this:

+--------- Emacs ----------+
+--------------------------+
|1           |56           |
|            |             |
|            |             |
|            |             |
|            |             |
|55          |110          |
+--------------------------+

but you can't have this:

+---Emacs ---+   +---Emacs ---+
+------------+   +------------+
|1           |   |56          |  
|            |   |            |
|            |   |            |
|            |   |            |
|            |   |            |
|55          |   |110         |   
+------------+   +------------+

I will make another suggestion to the Emacs developers pertaining to this
feature then. Actually, here is where the problem comes in. In the latter
picture, both "Emacs" windos would have to have the same toolbar color.
If not, then scrolling down a highlighted window would move the cursor in
a nonhighlighted window. Really, this should be a window manager feature.

Even without follow-mode, having two windows display the same thing would
be nice. Just like  2 windows in Emacs without follow mode. Why should
everything appear in "one" rectangular box. Why not have things displayed
in more than just "one" rectangular box?

Ok, here is how the follow-mode like feature would work:

Imagine an application running in a window, say vi editor showing a long
file. Imagine having an extra button on the window toolbar. When you press
this button another new window pops. This window shows the part of the
long file immediately below the last line displayed in the former window.
Now you can place the new window with the mouse where you like. The new
window generated in this manner has the same color as the first window
since they show the same application and scrolling from one window moves
you to the second window.

Is this not a good enough description on how the feature would be
implemented? If something is unclear please don't hesitate to mail me.
I hope my explanation is satisfactory.

Why would I want such a feature? There are many editors out there but not
all have follow-mode. As I already said, right now it is impossible for
two or more windows (here by windows I mean real windows with frames, not
windows within a window) to interact via follow mode, and this is true of
any application including Emacs.

Best Reagrds,

Neil

I  don't believe what you  are now proposing  is  possible.  When an X
application  places text in  a window,  it  does it by  relative pixel
position.   The  window  manager has  no  way  to get   in-between the
application and X at this level.

Ok, that's your choice. Nobody HAS to use [X]Emacs. It's simply very

True. Probably nobody found it necessary, so nobody implemented it.
Personally, I never found a use to the existing follow-mode as well...

Looks very much like the typical problem any application (and user) would
have with your proposed "follow-mode".

(What's the "toolbar color"? XEmacs has toolbars, and are all the same color.
FSF Emacs does not have toolbars. Also vi...)

  NZ> Really, this should be a window manager feature.

Why? We are talking editors here. E.g, how could any window manager provide X
windows capabilities/awereness to standard vi?

You can have "two" or "more" rectangular boxes in an Emacs window. Emacs call
them, perhaps a little confusingly, "windows". And a buffer can be displayed
in several windows. I use it everyday in editing: e.g., two windows showing
two different parts of a file. Of course, you can also have two "frames"
(Emacs parlance for X windows) display the same file/buffer.

Perhaps I misunderstood the whole point, in that case my apologies.

And maybe (IMHO) this topic is a bit off the Fvwm list...

Imaging such a case: to use your mouse to select some texts in 
Netscape window, then point the mouse to a xterm window and 
double-click it, the selected texts are to be pasted. who handles
such kind of pasting operation?

I know there is definitely a mechnism to enable such kind of
selection/copy/paste BETWEEN X applications, just like in 
Win 95/NT or DEC Unix.

How has it been implemented in FVWM, or in Linux X11 according
to you? 

Thx.

Both Netscape and Xterm.

Netscape 'owns' the selection and xterm asks for a copy of it.
The two are allowed to argue about what sort of selection would
be passed.  (Usually it is just text, but programs like xmag and
pixmap allow XPixmaps to be passed.)

FVWM doesn't get to play in that exchange: it is between the
two clients how to pass things and even the format in which it is
passed.

Hello guys,

I managed to configure my fvwm2.0.46 into a very nice and useable desktop
(see my fvwm2rc attached). However, to make it almost absolutely perfect I
need to be able to do the following.

I bound Ctrl-ESC to show WinList so I can select a window from it.
However, the windows in WinList are stacked in a dynamic manner. What I
want is to ensure that a particular thing, e.g. FvwmButtons always appears
on top of the WinList so pressing Ctrl-ESC followed by 1 will always
select FvwmButtons without me having to look at the list find a miniicon I
assigned to it and select it (I got rid of the need to use the mouse
almost - now I want to avoid looking at the screen as well :) ).

Regards,

If this post does not belong here - I just subscribed here last night
and I apoligize for the extranious bandwidth, but I am using FVWM 1.24
on a BSDI 3.1 system.

The Question:

What is the syntax for setting the DPMS power settings? In installing
the X server /etc/Xaccell.ini is setup with:

     :
[SCREEN]
    Board   = "s3/764-1.xqa";
    Monitor = "mfreq/mfreq64.vda";
    Depth   = 8;
    Desktop = 1024x768;
    EnergyStar = YES;
     :

The .xinitrc file refers to SuspendTime and OffTime. Are these set with
xset or added to /etc/Xaccell.ini?  the BSDI man pages do not mentions
these parms at all. The only ref to DPMS is to say it is experiemental
(it works using some defaults).

My final question is can/does with work with using a screen saver. I.e.,
I would like to have xlock get turned on and then have the monitor move
to the low power modes after an interval.

Thanks for any help

Perhaps this question is a little off topic but how do you take screenshots.
I am assuming some software is used rather than taking a picture of the screen
and scanning it in which would be rather silly I think.

BTW, I am runing Linux and have access to DEC, HP/UX, SunOS, FreeBSD, etc...

Thanks, 

Neil

xv, xwd, xwpick are a few... available on debian-mirrors as binaries and
sources.. rpms shouldn't be hard to find either.. (xwd is in the xbase
package)

        It's a tad off-topic, not being a window-manager issue,
but the group's usually pretty good-natured about this sort of question.

        Yes. Both.

        Your AcceleratedX install should have included a verbose man
page called Xaccel.1, which should explain the Xaccel.ini setup, so try
"man Xaccel" (or, better, if you use xman, look for Xaccel at the top of 
Section 1).

        To change the settings on the fly, use "xset s [settings]" -
check the xset man page. I normally set it like so -

                xset s 600 300

in a little script that I run from the InitFunction function in my
fvwmrc. This gives me 10 minutes before the monitor is kicked into 
standby mode, then another 5 before it shuts off.

        Er...does what work with the screensaver?  :-)  In any case
the answer is yes. If you mean FVWM, it doesn't interfere with the
screensaver. If you mean the AcceleratedX X server, yes, it works fine
with xlock. Xaccel will switch your monitor to low power mode regardless
of whether xlock is running or not. 

        I believe that xscreensaver, on the other hand, overrides the X
server's DPMS settings. I'm not sure there's any way around this short
of writing a little script to manipulate xscreensaver, and shut it down
after a suitable interval.

Hello guys,

I tried to bind Meta-ESC to switch to FvwmButtons but it failed.
Any idea why?

What version of fvwm, UNIX, X, are you running?

Key Escape   R M ....

works for me (fvwm2 2.0.46, Solaris).

If you have something like:

you will only be able to get to it with:

Hi,

How do I change the size of the pager in fvwm1?

So far I have been quite insuccessful though I have managed to position the 
pager in the upper left hand corner.

Thanks,

Neil

I have a related question. Can I make FvwmPager desktop window appear and
dis-appear with the hit of a key, say Esc or Meta-Esc etc., Are there any
performance concerns, would it work. I want to hear from experts before
trying, if they had tried anything like this.

Sorry Neal, can't answer any fvwm1 questions, its been too long.

You could create and kill it but I think that would be too slow.

Try to set its style to "NoIcon",
use one keystroke to iconify it, 
the other keystroke to de-iconify it.

I've been having a conversation with JWZ about a problem I'm seeing with
the latest xscreensaver (2.21) on my SunOS 4.1.4 system at work, running
X11R6.3 (fix2)--note: _not_ openwindows.

Note I donn't have this problem with the previous version of
xscreensaver I was using (2.07).

However, I _ALSO_ don't have this problem with other window managers,
like mwm, just with fvwm2 (2.0.46).

However however, I don't have this problem on fvwm2 on my Linux box at
home, which is exactly the same code (I ftp'd it down from my SunOS box
and compiled it myself).

Both of my systems are using 8-bit displays (my Linux box has a 2M
graphics card but I run it at 1152x900 to match my Sun at work).

What happens is that the colormaps get screwed up... the _SECOND_ time
xscreensaver activates.

I do this:

  $ xscreensaver &
  $ xscreensaver-command -next

and it looks fine.  Even if I let the graphics hack cycle, it works
fine.  Now I hit a key to deactive the screensaver, and I type:

  $ xscreensaver-command -next

again, and this time the colormap is hosed: the background is white
instead of black and the colors are all wrong.  If I stop/restart the
xscreensaver process, then it works again... the first time.

Note the xscreensaver man page has this to say about a very
similar-sounding problem with twm:

     TWM and Colormaps
             The installColormap option doesn't work  very  well  with  the
             twm(1) window manager and its descendants.

             There is a race condition between  the  screensaver  and  this
             window manager, which can result in the screensaver's colormap
             not getting installed properly,  meaning  the  graphics  hacks
             will appear in essentially random colors.  (If the screen goes
             white instead of black, this is probably why.)

             The mwm(1) and olwm(1) window managers don't seem to have this
             problem.   The race condition exists because X apparently does
             not provide a way for an OverrideRedirect window to  have  its
             own colormap, short of grabbing the server (which is neither a
             good idea, nor really possible with the current design.)  What
             happens  is  that,  as  soon  as  the screensaver installs its
             colormap, twm responds to the  ColormapNotify  event  that  is
             generated  by  re-instaling the default colormap.  Apparently,
             twm doesn't always do this; it seems to do it regularly if the
             screensaver is activated from a menu item, but seems to not do
             it if the screensaver comes on of  its  own  volition,  or  is
             activated  from another console.

Note if I start xscreensaver with the -no-install option, so it doesn't
install a colormap, it doesn't behave this way.

Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas about what might be behind this
problem, and how it might be fixed?  Where, exactly, is the bug?

Hi,
I have downloaded fvwm ver.1.24r and followed the instructions in the 
README.Install file.  That is, I downloaded the files fvwm-1_24r_tar.gz, 
fvwm-core_tar.gz, fvwm-icons_tar.gz, and fvwm-modules_tar.gz.  After I 
unzipped and untar'ed these files, I ran xmkmf, make Makefiles, and make 
all.

The installation fails during the "make all" command, showing the 
following messages:
   FvwmBanner.c:33:X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory.
   Make[1]: ***[FvwmBanner.o] Error 1make[1]: Leaving directory 
'/var/tmp/modules/FvwmBanner'
   make:*** [all] Error 2
I ran commands as a root user.  The README.Install file tells us to 
monitor the output of the commands for error messages, but does not say 
what to do with the errors.  When I searched the xpm.h file in the 
entire disk, there was not.  From where should it be obtained?

The base OS I'm using is Linux, Red Hat distribution rel.4.1, kernel 
ver.2.0.27.  On top of it, I have installed X Windows, XFree86 3.3.2.  
I'm now trying to make fvwm work.  Can you please help?  

Thanks,

Fumi Myers

Is it possible to change the Title of a Xterm window
while it is already open ?

Well I've tried this on my Solaris box cause I just installed 2.21 of
xscreensaver today and it works fine.  
2 things that are different
   1.) I start xscreensaver with the -display option because it wasn't
getting the variable correctlly in my .fvwm2rc file 
   2.)I am using Sun's X server (the one under openwin), this was because
the X11R6.4 server had lots of font problems and you can't use a lot of
the sun tools because the X11R6 server doesn't start a postscript server.


With these to things combined it does work, it has also finally finished
building on my sparc II (the only one with SunOs 4.1.4 left) and it works
fine if I start it remotelly.  So my first suggestion would be to use the
sun X server and see if it happens again.  And trust me you won't notice
much of a performance hit since sun just took the X11r6 server and then
put there hardware specific stuff into it.  

Hope this helps, or at least gives you an idea.

    Key Escape	A	M	TogglePager

    DestroyFunc	"TogglePager"
    AddToFunc	"TogglePager"
      "I"	Next ["Fvwm Pager" CirculateHit] Close
    + "I"	None ["Fvwm Pager" CirculateHit] Module FvwmPager 0 3


This will cause the Meta-Escape key to be interpreted as follows:

- If FvwmPager is running, remove it from the screen.
- If FvwmPager is not running, start it up with four desktops

This can be easily modified for your own situation.

Yes, I read about this in the Linux Journal. This is the part of my .cshrc
file which makes the title to be "UserID@HOST:DIRECTORY"

...
switch ($TERM)
      case "xterm*":
          set prompt="%{\033]0;%n@%m:%~\007%}I Love %m: "
          breaksw
...

You can certainly change it to fit your needs. I am using tcsh. I don't
remember exactly how to change the title of the xterm if you are using
other shells though.

Well, to me this sounds a lot more like a race condition than a server
problem (changing servers changes the timing of events.)

Perhaps it would shed some light if someone would explain exactly the
conditions under which fvwm installs a colormap.

yes,

does the trick for me. replace 'CONSOLE' with whatever text string you

Is it possible to change the titlebar bevel width? With any option?
How about modifying the source?

Hi,

I think this is present in Afterstep to some extent but I am not sure.

This is a pager:

|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     | <---- clicking on this button with mouse 1 launches an application
|     | <---- clicking this button with mouse 3 causes the following ....
|-----|                                            see below
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|



...

|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     | < hey, we can now choose from 4 other things
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|
|     |
|     |
|-----|


The purpose of this is:

1) we can save desktop space and avoid cluttering

2) we can group applications of similar functionality together on the pager

Neil

Since Afterstep is fvwm-1.x based, perhaps Afterstep 1.0's Wharf bar will work
with one of the fvwm-1.x releases?

I know the FvwmTaskBar from fvwm95 works on fvwm-2.0.46 or whatever.

Besides, you can probably have FvwmButtons call another FvwmButtons and
position it where you want a flyout menu to go. Then have the button kill that
flyout menu after executing the command chosen. I'm sure it's possible to make
a Wharf replica that way, at least something similar.

This module has been ported for FVWM v2.0.46

Its FvwmWharf, and you can find here in the tarball:
./fvwm-2.0.46/extras/FvwmWharf/ASSound/README

It doesnt compile automatically... you have to do it manually

Actually, that's not a pager.  It's a button bar, called `Wharf' in
AfterStep.  A pager allows navigation of a virtual desktop, not
starting of programs.

The functionality you're asking about has already been done.  FvwmWharf
is a module that comes with fvwm2, but doesn't compile by default.  The
recent Red Hat Linux releases include FvwmWharf as part of the fvwm2
package.

I'm using AIX 3.2.5 with X11R5 and fvwm-2.0.43. Whenever I restart fvwm, 
I get an error saying that there is an error in the EXEC module, bad 
pixmap or drawable, like the following -- 

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  54 (X_FreePixmap)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  27068
  Current serial number in output stream:  27078
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window 
parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62 (X_CopyArea)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x1400010
  Serial number of failed request:  585850
  Current serial number in output stream:  847995

I've also run into the _exact_ same problem running fvmw95 2.0.46 on AIX 
4.2.1  We are assuming it has something to do with colormap allocation, 
but even with nothing open really, I still get the error. Anybody got 
any ideas?

Thanks.
Monty

Re: the FvwmWharf - Can it :

Be horizontal and pop vertically ?

Be swallowed into Fvwm buttons ?

Just use mini-icons (no text) ?

I'm not interested in its use for a pager, but for program launching
within a task bar (rather like the printer pop-out/up on CDE)

Consider it done. I post some patches few months ago. I will try to add
this to the future version of fvwm2, once the cvs is running. Check

http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~fvwm/P/unix.html

In fact, Albrecht mentioned some concept of the 'permanent/transient' container
in FvwmButtons, which binds menu/action to a swallowed button. This hasn't
be implemented yet.

PS: Did anybody get AutoHide working in FvwmTaskBar module? I don't know
    what's wrong with my FvwmTaskBar settings.

Sorry, the URL should be

http://www.cae.wisc.edu/~fengj/P/unix.html

The top one on my screenshot1.jpg is written by Orlando Andico at eee.upd.edu.ph
But it seems the URL and it's mirror site are moved
http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/FvwmCDE/
http://www.mozcom.com/~orly/FvwmCDE/
I still have the source code, but the copyright mentioned in the README file
does not say I can redistribute it. Probably you have to use some web search
engines to find it.

The second one was downloaded at http://www.d.umn.edu/~mbaron/panel/index.html
But it has been moved too. I think the author Matt Baron left there. The
last version as I can recall is 0.42a.

There was another guy in France using xform library to write CDE like panel.
I didn't write down his URL, since I've made the patches.

        Neither of these url's seems to work anymore, nor does the one
referenced on the FVWM home page - and I can't seem to locate him anywhere
at the U. of Philippines sites. Orlando, if you're still following the
FVWM lists, could you please give us an update on where you are these days?

        Matt's new home page is at http://www.wavefront.com/~mbaron - 
the Panel page is http://www.wavefront.com/~mbaron/panel.

And the statically linked binary ain't there.  <sigh>

I tried many of these panels.  I think the best you can find now is
XFCE, from Olivier Fourdan.  This is the URL:

OK, I'm using 2.0.46 and XFCE 1.2.9.  I got my pager working the way I want 
it, but it's in the lower left corner and I need it in the upper right.  My 
screen is 1024x768 and the pertinent lines are:

*FvwmPagerGeometry 1 1
*FvwmPagerStartIconic

What do I put in the geopetry to put it up in the upper right?  Seems like 
every time I put a negative number in, the pager simply doesn't come up.

Also, XFCE seems to be stepping on my environment.  Specifically, my 
NNTPSERVER variable.  I need this active so I can pull binaries down off the 
net with slrn.  Knews doesn't work for this purpose, I use it for my other 
readings.  Any clues?

*FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1

-0+0 doesn't work with all versions of fvwm AFAIK.

The colours look pretty crappy in my browser, but you get the idea.

One problem we have is that different modules implement this in different
ways. I'm fairly certain that FvwmIconMan does it correctly (it damn well
better given the effort I had to put into it), and FvwmBUttons should as
well. 

A wise thing to do would be to go through all of the other modules and get
them doing the same thing (probably by adding a routine to fvwmlib to do
it). I might look into it this weekend.

I've tried setting them in /etc/profile (I'm a bash'er) and $HOME/.bash_rc.  I start up with an xdm login cause my roomie sometimes uses my machine and he's not too up on CLI's yet.

How can I install fvwm in Solaris? Do I need to install X11Rx first before I

You will need a couple of things...

Make sure you have SUNWxwh the X (header) files...
and also compile and install libXpm

That should be a start,

changing key-defs in .fvwm2rc need a reread .fvwm2rc

I can't help you directly, but before you spend a lot of time on it
you should know that ``asclock'' does not understand the DISPLAY
option or environment variable!  That makes it useless if you log in
from another workstation or X-terminal.  I use rclock for that
reason. 

About a year ago I tried asclock with FvwmButtons and the remnants are 
still in my .fvwm2rc:

#*FvwmButtons(2x2, Frame 0, Padding 12 4, Swallow "asclock" "Exec nice 16 \
#	asclock -24 -shape &", Action "Exec ical &")
#*FvwmButtons(Swallow "asclock" 'Exec nice 16 \
#	asclock -24 -shape &')
m4_define({BUTTONS_CLOCK_AND_MAIL},{
*FvwmButtons(1x1, Frame 2, Padding 0 5, Container(Rows 1))
  *FvwmButtons(Frame 0, Swallow "rclock" 'Exec nice 16 \
    rclock -display _DISPLAY_ -mail 20 -geometry +15000+15000 -bg AV_MARB_GREY -fg MARB_FOREGND &')
  *FvwmButtons(End)
*FvwmButtons(Title xISP, Icon xisp.xpm, Action \
	'Exec "X-ISP" /usr/X11/bin/xisp -geometry +1010+832 &')
##*FvwmButtons(Size 48 48, Icon M_MARBLES/grey5mrb.xpm)})

I'm using the latest and greatest FvwmIconMan and have the
"*DrawIcons always" setting. I think I'd like two Iconmanagers, one
showing windows that aren't iconified and another showing just iconified
windows.  I think I'd like to be able to use

*FvwmIconMan*1*DontShow Iconified
*FvwmIconMan*2*Show Iconified

Plus for good measure

*FwwmIconMan*1*DontShow Transient

Any thoughts on if this is a good idea/feasible?

Cheers,
Tim.

When you start an xdm session you don't actually get a login shell,
so your .profile is never run. You could set the variables in your
.xsession, but the way I always do it is to write .profile so that
it can just be sourced in my .xsession. All my profile does is set
env variables, anyway. Everything else for the shell is done in the
rc file.

A simple .xsession would look something like this:

  #!/bin/sh

  if [ -f ${HOME}/.profile ] ; then
    . ${HOME}/.profile
  fi

  xrdb -load ${HOME}/.Xdefaults

    When attempting to install Fvwm2, I'm encountering a couple
problems.  First and foremost, the compile always fails for lack of the
file libfvwm2.a, which for some unfathomable reason the makefile
searches for two directories back.
 
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../../libs/libfvwm2.a', needed by...
 
   This file is nowhere on my drive and it can't be built, so I'm
wondering where I'm supposed to get it.  The FAQ and BUGS don't mention
this type of an error, and the web page doesn't mention any files
necessary to install fvwm2 other than fvwm-2.0.46.tgz, so I'm assuming I
didn't miss any files?
 
    The other "feature" is that for some only the shell script
MakeMakefiles actually works -- attempting to make Makefiles after xmkmf
only results in the make getting dizzy by jumping into and out of every
directory and claiming "there's nothing to do!".

    Ideas?  Suggestions?  Comments?  Insults?  Keep 'em coming...

Yes, it is quite good and feasible. I havne't had time to add such a feature

Using fvwm 2.0.46 beta, I cannot specify colors like this:

*FvwmPagerHilight \#cecece

This is OK, however:

*FvwmPagerHilight grey80

It just seems inconsistent since I can specify:

HilightColor black \#bebebe 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, it seems that Exec string literals are loaded into fixed size
arrays rather than being dynamically allocated. I had to rename the
pixmaps (make the names smaller) in the following Exec string to
accomodate the fixed size that fvwm expects.

*FvwmButtons(Swallow(Respawn,NoHints) xbiff `Exec xbiff -rv -bg grey60 -shape -xrm "*fullPixmap: /usr/common/pixmaps/Mail1.xbm" -xrm "*emptyPixmap: /usr/common/pixmaps/Mail2.xbm" -xrm "*fullPixmapMask: /usr/common/pixmaps/Mail1M.xbm" -xrm "*emptyPixmapMask: /usr/common/pixmaps/Mail2M.xbm"`)

Granted, this is an exceptional case since most exec strings would
resonably fit within the fixed storage size, but I think fvwm2 should
be more robust and handle any string size, within the limits of the
hardware, of course.

I just installed Red Hat 5.1 and I am not sure which configuration file I
should edit to make the FvwmPager *not* sticky which appears to be the
default. The included documentation in /usr/doc/fvwm-2.0.46 refers the user
to .fvwm2rc. When I "find / -name .fvwm2rc* -print" the following directory
pops up -  /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/ - with files :

decors
fvwm2rc.apps.m4
fvwm2rc.decors.m4
fvwm2rc.defines.m4
fvwm2rc.defstyles.m4

fvwm2rc.menus.m4
fvwm2rc.modules.m4
fvwm2rc.mouse.m4
fvwm2rc.xlock.m4
scripts

I tried commenting out the line:
Style "FvwmPager"    StickyOnTop,WinCircSkip,NoDecoration
in file fvwm2rc.modules.m4, exit and restart Xwindows, but nothing happened.

The pager is making scrolling difficult in other applications. Can someone
help me find the complete path of the configuration file to edit and what to
edit?

Thankyou for your kind attention to my problem.

Hi,

On my RH5.0 system I can edit (as root) a file called system.fvwm2rc

(do a "locate system.fvwm2rc" to fond it).

Then change the appropriate line and restart.

If you're not root than first copy system.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm2rc and then

restart.

BTW, does RH5.1 ship with fvwm(1) as well as fvwm2 or not? At least in fvwm(1)

it should work.

Best regards,

Neil

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


While 2.0.47 is coming out and a code freeze for 2.1 is being planned,
I'd appreciate if someone could take a look at the patches I have for
fixing a problem with FvwmWinList and some code written by a colleague
of mine to add sorting as an optional feature. The diffs to 2.0.46 are
available at:

http://noc.rutgers.edu/~rapatel/personal/fvwm-patches.tar.gz

Note that I am not on the mailing list, so please respond to me directly
if you have any questions.

Here is the information on the changes:

Vince Sgro (June 22, 1996):

1) The WinList has the really annoying habit of trying to use every
means it has to let you know in what state a window currently exists.
For example, if you have set up the WinList to display iconified and
uniconified windows in different colors, then you have no need for the
silly parenthesis that it tacks on the beginning and end of the button
labels.  The code now checks if the foreground and background colors
are the same for iconified and uniconified windows.  If they are, then
the parens are added.  If not, the titles are left alone.

2) To aid in locating buttons in large button lists, I have added the
capability to have the items sorted alphabetically.  Just use the
*FvwmWinListAlphaOrder.

----------------------------

Rakesh Patel (June 29, 1998):

1) Use strcmp instead of strcasecmp - emulates
twm/tvtwm/fvwm/FvwmIconMan behaviour where case does matter
during a sort. [Names starting in uppercase come first].

2) Fix geometry code in FvwmWinList.c to work properly - previous
code had an attempt at fixing the problem, however it failed. The fix is
in AdjustWindow().



Thanks,
Rakesh Patel

Hi,

I would like to create a pixmap (.xpm) so that I can perhaps use it with 
FvwmButtons. How do I go about doing this?

Thanks,

Neil

	Is there a way, using FvwmButtons, to 'pass through' a mouseclick on
a swallowed window, such that another (hidden) app is started? I'm thinking
of, say, xload -- which is a commonly swallowed program in many buttonbars.
When you click on it, it might start top. Or swallow one of the clock pgms
(xclock, rclock, etc), and a click on that might start a program that would
pop up a calendar, or an appointment book, or start a saytime pgm. I use
xeyes as a swallowed pgm. It strikes me this'd be a neat thing to click on
to start a screen lock (as opposed to popping up the utilities menu and
moving to the screen lock section). Of course, this would only work on a
swallowed window, but it seems to me this'd be a Neat Thing, if it were
possible. It'd be even better if there was a way to map button one, button
two, and button three (with or without modifiers) to do different things. 

	I'm fairly sure Afterstep (barf) has this facility in its Wharf, and
the aclock pgm (which is very neat) will allow a keyclick on it to invoke an
otherwise hidden pgm, as does asmodem. Of course, these instances are
inherent in those pgms.

did you do a 'make' or a 'make install'.
the former does make the library, while the latter does nothing in the 'libs'
directory, and keeps complaining about the missing library in all other
directories.

don't know about that. 'make Makefiles' always worked for me, although

I assume you're using fvwm2.  Currently, if you swallow an app, all
mouse clicks get passed to the app on the assumption that's what you
want.  This sucks for apps that don't do anything with mouse clicks
but that's the way it is.  A while back I tried to come up with an
option that would override this.  It seemed simple enough at first,
but I'm not an X programmer and I ran into a couple brick walls and
punted with a workaround because I didn't have enough time to put into
it.

My workaround is to provide the swallowed app with a miniscule blank
title area (I think that frame padding works too, but I don't remember
for sure).  If you click in the title/frame, the mouse is intercepted
by FvwmButtons and the Action configuration is honored.  If you click
in the app, the app gets the click.

Here's an example of how I use this.  I swallow xmeter (an xload like
program that monitors various stuff in addition to load).  I define
the title to be whitespace with nil2 as the font so I get a title area
that's about 2 or 3 pixels high.  If I click on that, I get the action
depending on which button is clicked (an xterm running top, or
raising/lowering the buttonbar.)  If I click in the xmeter, I get it's
usual mouse response.

*FvwmButtons(10x8, Frame 1, Action `Exec "top" TOP`, \
    Action (Mouse 2) "Next [FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Raise", \
    Action (Mouse 3) "Next [FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Lower", \
    Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) XMeter "Exec XMETER", \
    Font nil2, Title " ")

For xmeter, this is pretty good, if not ideal; I get a fully
functional xmeter plus the extras I want for that button.  I also do
this for xclock, which is not so great since xclock doesn't do
anything with the mouse clicks.

Don't know if it works in Fvwm 1, but shouldn't
*FvwmPagerGeometry axb+c+d do the trick ?

Near 2000, Neil Zanella mumbled something about:

> I would like to create a pixmap (.xpm) so that I can perhaps use it with 
> FvwmButtons. How do I go about doing this?

1) xpm files are in very simple format. Just look at some xpm files and you'll
be able to make simple .xpm files with just a text editor like Vim.

2) For more complex icons, create them with a drawing utility (xpaint is usually
available on Linux boxes) and then use XV to load it and convert it to xpm.
I used this trick to convert jpg images (portraits of certain female
humanoids, for example) to xpm icons.

3) There should be xpm creation utilities out there somewhere, try asking on IRC
channel #linux.

4) Search the web and be amazed about how many icons you'll find.
Don't use too many if you're not running 16-bit colors or better, though...
I can do whatever I want on my friend's Linux box, but on the SGI machines
at the university I can only run 8-bit colors so I don't even think about using
a buttonbar anyway :-(

Hope this helps,

At the end of this message are the FvwmWinList patches to 2.0.47b for
sorting and the geometry fix for the problem that becomes visible when
using the sorting option. [Diffs are relative to the FvwmButtons
directory].

When converting over to 2.0.47b, I suddenly ran into a problem with
FvwmButtons where the icons do not appear [only the title appears for
some reason - woth 2.0.46 the icon appears]. The syntax I use in my
.fvwm2rc is :

ModulePath /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2
PixmapPath /usr/local/X11/include/X11/pixmaps:/td/nog/unix/X/images
IconPath /usr/local/X11/include/X11/bitmaps

Any suggestions as to why the title only appears with the new FvwmButtons code?

No, it doesn't do the trick, and I don't know why.

I am thinking that the command might be misplace within the file.

I'm new to Linux and I'm running Redhat 5.1 (i386) with fvwm2/fvwm95.
The default fvwm setup produces xload, a pager titled "Desk", and a
pager titled "Apps" in the lower right corner (both 4X4).  I'm not sure
what the "Apps" pager is for (I assume for applications), and I really
don't want it there, just xload and "Desk". I've grepped through what
seems like the appropriate directories and have found only the following
lines in /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.modules.m4:

*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Desk
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Apps

So I commented out the second line and now I have a "Desk" pager and a
"Desk 1" pager. Can someone tell me how to remove the "Apps" pager.

Hi,

In other words, say I have 9 screens configured in my desktop 0. Is it possible
for me to say "Meta 1" to switch to 1st screen TO "Meta 9" to switch to 9th screen.

I sat down and tested some different WM's one day.. and when I tried
gwm, I saw what a nice pager it had.. It was resizing dynamically, so
to get more space, you'd just move more in one direction, and viola.

It kinda zoomed out in the pager, so the "preview windows" got smaller
the more space you had.. This seems to be a pretty neat feature..
Anyone feel like hacking it into fvwmpager?

Does the IconBox directive take more than one set of coordinates? Or
perhaps there's a way to force the population of icons in a specific
direction? I'm using 

Style "*" IconBox 10 100 64 -70  

which does what I want, until I have more than 8 iconified apps, when
icons start appearing wherever the cursor is. What I'd like is
something like 

Style "*" IconBox 10 100 900 -70  

but I want icons to populate the box top-to-bottom first, before going
left-to-right.

        If it's Fvwm version 1, the command is

              DeskTopScale <divisor>

and for version 2 it's
 
             *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale <divisor> 

where the reduction factor is 1/divisor. In other words, to show
things in the pager at 1/36 the size of the actual desktop, you'd
specify "DeskTopScale 36".

        Specifying the width and height in the geometry command 
is rather iffy, and the man page recommends against it if you want
to keep the aspect ratio undisturbed. This is because the pager has
no fixed width - it shows as many desktops as you specify in the
pager invocation. (I'm not sure you could specify the width+height
in FvwmPagerGeometry in version 1.)

	Now, if a little advertising is allowed ...
	(not very off-topic, I like and use fvwm2 ;)

	Check http://nether.tky.hut.fi/iconstore/

	I've collected 48x48 icons from the net, and you
	can preview them, pick them one at a time or a
	pack at a time. Copyrights belong to the respective
	authors, but as far as I know, all the icons there
	are at least freely distributable.

	Format is jpg, tif or xpm, and when converting, use
	something like GIMP or ImageMagick, XV leaves the
	transparency information out of the saved xpm:s.
	If you use that you must edit the background color
	to transparency color by hand (which isn't terribly
	hard if you take a look in a xpm where transparency
	info exists).

	All the best,

	Tomi
