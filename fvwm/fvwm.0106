Howdy

I am trying to compile latest stable build on a Solaris machine
where I don't have root.  I used the --prefix option with ./configure 
to specify my home directory.. but configure stops at:

checking argument types of select()... configure: error: can't determine
argument types

I spent an hour reading documentation various places (including 
on on autoconf) but I can't find any hints on how to get around this.
Any suggestions would be appreciated; please copy to 
email: hamlin@pa.msu.edu

By latest stable build do you mean 2.2.5?

You should mention the Solaris release and
the compiler and compiler release.

On my Solaris 2.8 machine, with gcc 2.8.1, and fvwm 2.2.5,
configure does 3 checks for select(), this is the one that works:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
extern select(int, fd_set *, fd_set *, fd_set *, struct timeval *);
int main() {
; return 0; }

Try compiling that and see if it compiles OK.

Here's a follow up with more information to anyone who can help.
Again, please copy any replies to hamlin@pa.msu.edu.

pavo:~/bin/fvwm-2.2.5>uname -a
SunOS pavo 5.7 Generic_106541-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
pavo:~/bin/fvwm-2.2.5>gcc -v
Reading specs from
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1/2.7.2.2/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.2

I wouldn't know what is interesting enough to post to the list; except
perhaps for one thing:
  fvwm-2.2.5   managed to finish the configure,  but fvwm-2.3.32 did NOT.

configure: failed program was:
#line 5031 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#ifdef HAVE_SYS_TIME_H
#include <sys/time.h>
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H
#include <sys/types.h>
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H
#include <unistd.h>
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H
#include <sys/select.h>
#endif
#ifdef HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H
#include <sys/socket.h>
#endif
int main() {
extern select (int,
 fd_set *,      fd_set *, fd_set *,
 struct timeval *);
; return 0; }

I went and looked in the header files to find the source of the errors.

/usr/include/sys/siginfo.h:74: parse error before `pthread_attr_t'
/usr/include/sys/siginfo.h:74: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or
union
/usr/include/sys/siginfo.h:76: parse error before `}'

063:  /*
064:   * The sigevent structure is also defined in <time.h> as per X/Open
065:   * and POSIX requirements.
066:   */
067:  #ifndef _SIGEVENT
068:  #define _SIGEVENT
069:  struct sigevent {
070:          int             sigev_notify;   /* notification mode */
071:          int             sigev_signo;    /* signal number */
072:          union sigval    sigev_value;    /* signal value */
073:          void            (*sigev_notify_function)(union sigval);
074:          pthread_attr_t  *sigev_notify_attributes;
075:          int             __sigev_pad2;
076:  };
077:  #endif  /* _SIGEVENT */


/usr/include/sys/socket.h:47: parse error before `sa_family_t'
/usr/include/sys/socket.h:47: warning: data definition has no type or
storage class

045:  #ifndef _SA_FAMILY_T
046:  #define _SA_FAMILY_T
047:  typedef uint16_t        sa_family_t;
048:  #endif


Appears as a syntax issue in the first one (semicolon to end the union
definition BEFORE the close parenthesis?).  The second looks like a
missing definition of "uint16_t".  The next error in socket.h is caused
by similar missing symbol "uint32_t", and later errors appear to be
problems with these data typedefs that failed in the first two errors.

There follows many pages of the same "parse errors" in siginfo.h
and socket.h, every time configure tries to compile something.

I went back and configured fvwm-2.2.5 from scratch and examined the
log, and found the -same- errors.. so why was 2.2.5 able to build,
but not 2.3.32 ?

thanks for your time.

between 2.2.5 and 2.3.32 with some fixes from the

are working better in the 2.3.32 series.

I tried compiling the code you show above on one of our Solaris 7
machines and it compiles without a problem.  I think it should
on your machine also.

I made it look like this:

#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
extern select(int, fd_set *, fd_set *, fd_set *, struct timeval *);
int main() {
; return 0; }

Maybe your feature tests aren't returning all the things they
should be, I looked in my config.h to see which of the flags were
defined.

Right now, I'm out of ideas.  Maybe someone else on the list
has an idea?

uint16_t isn't defined by gcc, its in one of the Sun Header files.
More likely, one of the feature tests failed, for example,
HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H isn't defined so it doesn't include
sys/socket.h leading to the symbol not being defined.

How about posting all the output from configure, I'll compare it
to what I get.  Don't forget to remove configure.cache first.

Also, did you try compiling that code I posted, if that doesn't work,
it would point to problems in your gcc/Solaris setup.

Take a look at FvwmDragWell in the 2.3.x betas.
Is that what you want?

Please note that you're trying to compile on a Solaris 7 system with a
GCC build on a Solaris 2.5.1 system.  This is very unlikely to work,
_especially_ with a version of GCC as old as 2.7.2.2.

I suggest you get a version of GCC compile on Solaris 7, and try that.
You can get prebuilt versions at sunfreeware.com, if you don't want to
build it yourself.

I don't know about older versions of gcc, but I've been using
gcc 2.8.1 built on Solaris 2.5.1 for a long time now.  I've used it
on everything up to Solaris 8.

But using one compiled on 2.5.1 on 7 is begging for trouble...
I haven't had any problems with 2.95.x on Solaris 2.6 or 8.

I forgot to say.. gcc uses its own copy of the system include files. So
you're using 2.5.1 system includes on 7 which can't be healthy..

I'm still looking at gcc 2.8.1, the results could be different
for other versions of gcc.

I just ran the sample in question under truss.  Although it does
look for gcc include files first, in this case, it only uses include
files from the system include directories.

Thats not to say that a gcc upgrade wouldn't solve this problem.

Indeed.

The scoop is this:

Older versions of GCC were ANSI-compliant and wanted to work on systems
which very often (in those days) didn't have compliant system headers.
This meant that developers were seriously stuck: they either had to
turn off most of the warnings and other good stuff in ANSI C, or they
had to modify their system headers themselves, or they had to live with
tons of bogus warnings.

So, GCC's install step would examine the system headers, correct these
bogosities, and install the corrected copies in a location private to
GCC.  GCC would look there _first_ for any system header and only
include the "real" system header, from /usr/include, if there wasn't a
private one.

The bad thing about this is that when you built GCC for one version of
the OS, then upgraded to a new version of the OS without reinstalling
GCC, now your compiler was using system headers from the old OS.  Very
bad, esp. for vendors like Sun who feel no compunction about completely
rewriting/rearranging their system headers wth just about every release.

Of course, as new versions came out, the system header copy became less
important as the vendors fixed their own headers.

But, GCC was left for a long time around 2.7.* without any upgrade at
all, so long after it was necessary GCC was copying the system headers
for Solaris.

When 2.8.* and EGCS came out, they fixed this and stopped copying the
system headers: now it has only the fundamental ones like stdarg.h,
etc.

The short story is as I said before: it's very dangerous to use GCC's
before 2.8 with a version of Solaris that it wasn't compiled for.

Even with newer GCC's it _can_ cause problems, but very very rarely.

Note that this is only the case for Solaris; for nearly all other
systems, GCC does fix headers.

And, yes, fixing headers is a huge kludge; but there's no other real way
to do it. (GCC 3 will be able to warn that a fixed header is outdated,
at least.)

> Even with newer GCC's it _can_ cause problems, but very very rarely.

I'd hedge my bets there and say `less often than before' :) If you're
doing much C++, especially with exceptions, even more especially with
shared libraries or threads, expect breakage when building on one
Solaris OS and running on another.

Yah.  It has been down for over a week.  I couldn't even get on last
weekend.  In fact, the mailing list has been down too.  I even emailed
Dom, who I knew to be a big contributor on the list, but he was
unaware of the cause.  I haven't gotten any list mail on fvwm in over
a month.

Could have been some kind of server meltdown.  As long as it's back up
now.

No, not the end subscribers.  If anything, fvwm had the dns problem.
The host could not be found for over a week.  It is unlikely that so
many people had dns problems that eliminated a single host (but not
the servers real dns name).  I was able to get to the machine that
serves fvwm.org (can't remember the name now), but not fvwm.org.

Either way, of course you can get it now.  It is back up.

  in fvwm 2.2.5:

  is there any way to set the particular window to stay on top? I know there
is a way to set a style for set of windows but I would like to have
something similar to 'Sticky' toggle to set the focused window to stay on
top...

  e.g. is there anything that would be to 'StayOnTop' (style) what 'Stick'
(action) is to 'Sticky' (style)?

  TIA

Sod that for a game of soldiers-the mailer went down just when I was
switching to Debian and Exim-fetchmail-procmail from Kmail, so

Hi !

I use the FvwmWinList to find my lost applications ;)

Mouse	2	R	N	Module  FvwmWinList Transient

I have one problem with it: If I press the middle mouse button at the lower edge of my screen, the list is hanging over the edge and I can't see anything. Thats similar on the right edge.

The other Menus are displayed correctly. How can I change that behaviour of the FvwmWinList ?

Hello.

fvwm (today CVS snapshot) incorrectly display titles with
characters in KOI8-R encoding for GTK+ applications (like Mozilla).
I suspect that these title are Unicode.

I attach screeshots of stuphead GTK+ app with fvwm and blackbox
window managers.

I built fvwm with ./configure  --enable-gnome

C is a double-edged sword--without any handle.

Dear List,

A couple of months ago, you were all really helpful, in helping me configure
AnotherLevel (Lestiff WM). I am greatful for that......

I have another question for you. I have two sticky windows, at the bottom of
my screen. They are sticky so that when I flip from page to page, they
follow me. Now, unfortunately, I can only run 800x600, and I find that most
of my windows, lap over the sticky ones. So, is there a way, so that if
these windows, overlap the sticky ones, that the sticky ones will "unstick"
themselves, thus freeing up my monitor space??

Your help, is once again appreciated.

Regards,

Thomas Adam

Hey all.  I just upgraded to fvwm2.3.32.  So far, I am just inching my
previous .fvwm2rc into the new config setups, so I am not really using
much of the new stuff.
One thing I am curious about, though.  And this is probably something
easy.

When I start a netscape browser window, I would like it to be placed
automatically at position +1+1.  The automatic sizing is fine.  What
should I add to the Style direcive?

TIA
Lou

Look in the manpage for StartsOnPage or StartsOnDesk. I suppose the
position can be arranged using the geometry option in your
$HOME/.Xdefaults file.

You should configure fvwm with --enable-multibyte

BTW, fvwm workers, the things --enable-multibyte do is no "enabling
multibyte", but enabling strings conversion needed by anyone who uses
not latin-1 locale.

Ok, extremely newbie question here.  I've searched the FAQ and the list
archive for anything matching "left-handed"  or "mouse", but I couldn't find
my answer.

I use my mouse left-handed and I can't figure out how to map button 3 to be
my "main" button, instead of button 1 (for menubar actions, browser
hyperlinks, etc).

I have customized my mouse and key bindings for the builtin fvwm commands
(e.g. Raise, Iconify, Maximize, etc....), but I'm struggling with how to
remap the core, base functionality of my mouse.

Any help would be appreciated.  

Thanks,
Angie

I found that the StartsOnPage and StartsOnDesk directives are more
directed toward making sure an app only starts on a specific page
and/or desktop, rather than deciding where on the current page it
should be placed.

It took a little playing around, but I finally got the following to do
the job from my ~/.Xdefaults file:

Netscape*geometry:            +1+1

Thanks for the push in the right direction.

  use xmodmap to remap the mouse button in X, then just do 'normal'
mouse bindings in fvwm...  see man xmodmap, search the man page for
'pointer', here's the most relevant part:

       Many pointers are designed such that the first  button  is
       pressed  using the index finger of the right hand.  People
       who are left-handed frequently find that it is  more  com­
       fortable to reverse the button codes that get generated so
       that the primary button is pressed using the index  finger
       of  the  left  hand.   This  could  be  done on a 3 button
       pointer as follows:

            %  xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

  put that command somewhere in you X startup scripts...

I have set up the keyboard so that various extra keys send symbols (it's
a logitech cordless itouch keyboard). I used following option in
keyboard config part of XF86Config:

Option          "XkbModel"      "logicordless"

  xev confirms that the extra keys really generate proper symbols.

  I have set up fvwm 2.2.5 so that it does appropriate actions but it
looks like the keys for volume (XF86AudioRaiseVolume &
XF86AudioLowerVolume) are ignored. When I press them, nothing happens
(and there is nothing printed on stderr). Here's the relevant part of
fvwm config file:

...
Key XF86AudioMute               A       N       Exec exec amixer sset
Master,0 0
Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume        A       N       Exec exec amixer sset
Master,0 5%+
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume        A       N       Exec exec amixer sset
Master,0 5%-
Key XF86AudioPlay               A       N       Exec exec xmms -p
...

  here's what xev says:

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
root 0x32, subw 0x0, time 837538822, (178,69), root:(197,118),
state 0x0, keycode 174 (keysym 0x1008ff11, XF86AudioLowerVolume),
same_screen YES,
XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
root 0x32, subw 0x0, time 837568792, (178,71), root:(197,120),
state 0x0, keycode 176 (keysym 0x1008ff13, XF86AudioRaiseVolume),
same_screen YES,
XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

  is it possible they are ignored because of the length of symbol
string? The XF86Audio(Lower)|(Raise)Volume is the longest one I have in
fvwm config file.

  I am quite sure that they are 'strange' because when I set up
keybindings for a special key (say XF86AudioPlay) this key does not show
as XF86AudioPlay in xev output anymore but it produces following output:

FocusOut event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor

FocusIn event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor

KeymapNotify event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x0,
    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  
0   
           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  
0   

  since volume keys still produce the keysyms in xev I guess the
keybinding was not successful.

  the only reason I can think of is the length of keysym - the volume
keys have the longest string as keysym...

I don't know if this helps, but in the case of the Windows keys XFree used
to see them as regular keys and then one day, it started seeing them as
modifiers (not out of the blue, but with an upgrade). Maybe that's the
problem you're having. I use Xmodmap to remap my Windows keys. My
xmodmaprc looks like this:

keycode 115 = L5

Here's what I have (in case it helps).

Key Up          A       CM      exec aumix -v +2
Key Down        A       CM      exec aumix -v -2

I use CTRL-ALT-(UP|DOWN) to control volume. Comes in helluva handy :-)

  thanks for the info but that's not it, the window key and all other
keys are working fine (standard and non-standard logitech keys), the
only two keys that do not work are the volume keys - they show up when I
try them with xev but fvwm ignores them...

  is there any way to get the fvwm report the key-bindings?

Just for everyone's information, the unprecedented flooding in Houston due
to the (remnants of) tropical storm Allison had us under water (in some
cases, more than twelve feet of water).  My building, which houses the
fvwm.org servers, will have no power for another ten weeks.

We have relocated the servers and are up and running in temporary space
elsewhere on campus.

  I would like to limit the windows in window list to windows on current
page. The manual says I can use CurrentDesk but it does not mention
CurrentPage (unlike in some other situations) and it indeed does not
work. Is there any way to limit the WindowList to display only certain
windows?

  the other question is - can I limit the windows by window title/name?
E.g. is it possible to display vim (or netscape or whatever) windows
only?

  TIA

  using fvwm 2.2.5

  there is a line in man page that defines the double click action for
WindowList (double click should focus previous window)

  here's the relevant part of man page:

----------------------------
	Key Tab A M WindowList "Prev FlipFocus"

  Hitting Alt-Tab once it brings up the window  list, if  you  hit  it
twice the focus is flipped between the current and the last focused
window.
----------------------------

  it does not seem to work though. The double click is recognized, I
guess, since when I hit the key combination twice the window list
appears and quickly disappears (when I hit the key combination too
slowly the second one has no effect and the WindowList stays on the
screen). The focus remain in the same window though. Any ideas?

  TIA

Since we're on the topic, should we start thinking of having
fvwm.org "mirrors" elsewhere (in the world) ?

While looking at a co-worker's desktop ( he uses WM ) they have
a setting called "Origin".  It seems to work on a per workspace basis
and it is the coordinates of the first window launched.  Didn't see
anything in the FAQ or man page and I went poking
through the source code and there is a "gravity" table but seems to
be Xresource related??.  Is this sort of thing possible with fvwm2.
I find I usually launch an app and move the window with the
keyboard, centering it in the workspace.

PS Glad to see everyone made it through the flooding OK...   :)

thanks

I've been using fvwm2 for a long time, but I use only a limited set of features.

One thing I've observed is that when I open my root menu, I can move the
cursor down the root menu until I get to the folder I want.  If I left
click on a folder, that folder is opened and the root menu disappears.
I really like this feature.

I've observed similar behavior with bookmarks in Netscape 4.7: when you
open your bookmarks, you can left click on a folder to open it.  Unlike
fvwm2, the main folder is not deleted, but you still can open a folder
by left clicking on it.

Tonight I had some free time for a change, and I tried using the newest
Mozilla and Netscape 6* browsers for the first time.  When both of those
browsers, when you open your bookmarks, you don't have the ability
to click on a folder to open it: you have to slowly move your mouse
to the right until you get to the arrow.

Searching the Netscape and Mozilla newsgroups and help pages got me nowhere.
But since this is similar behavior to what fvwm2 does, and I know you folks
all know a lot more about what's going on than I ever will, I thought
I'd ask for help...

Does anyone know if there's some why to get the "left click opens a folder"
behavior that fvwm2 has for it's root menu and Netscape 4.* has for
bookmarks, but which appears to be lacking Netscape 6 or Mozilla?

Thanks!

Paul Novak

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi,

I've discovered an interesting feature with recent versions of 
fvwm (last version to work for me was 2.0.46). When running 
Reflection X (v7.20) with "Treat windows desktop as X root" 
turned on and fvwm 2.2.5 (or 2.3.32) as window manager, it is 
not possible to raise an fvwm-managed window above a 
windoze-managed window. I've tracked it down to the function 
RaiseWindow() in fvwm/misc.c. Towards the end:

   if(i > 0)
     {
/*      XRaiseWindow(dpy,wins[0]);  */
       /*
            clasen@mathematik.uni-freiburg.de - 01/01/1999 -
          simply calling XRaiseWindow(dpy,wins[0]); here will put 
StaysOnTop
          windows over override_redirect windows like FvwmPager 
ballon_win or
          Motif menus. Instead raise wins[0] only above the 
topmost window
          which is managed by us.
       */
...

The remaining code in the if appears (like the comment states) 
to only raise a window above the topmost fvwm-managed window in 
the stack of windows. It appears Reflection X includes 
Windoze-managed windows in the stack, hence giving this feature. 
I've hacked the guts of the if out in 2.2.5 to achieve the old 
behavior, I'm just wondering if there is a better way to meet 
both goals?

BTW, please CC me in via email, I'm not subscribed to this list. Ta.

Thanks,
Paul Ripke

Maybe you should use the "Menu" command instead of "Popup". The first one
opens a new menu, the other one opens a submenu and keeps the root menu.

Example:

AddToMenu TestMenuA "TitleA" Title
+ "SubMenuText" Menu "TestSubMenu

If you want to change the way Mozilla menus work, you will have
to ask the Mozilla developers to make a change.

I am trying to compile fvwm 2.2.5 on Solaris 8 x86.  When I run
configure it goes for a while and the produces the following error:

checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can not run test program while cross compiling

Any ideas?

At the point where it decided it was using a cross compiler is
where it went wrong.

Look for the first failure.

I assume you are using gcc.  Is gcc working?

If you can't find the problem post the command you entered and
all the output.

If you are making changes, be sure to remove the configure.cache
between attempts.

First, if you simply want the current window to be on the top (raised),
use the following:

  FvwmAuto 0

If you really need for some reason to use StayOnTop (in other words to use
layers) dynamically, consider to upgrade to 2.3.32, which enables this:

  FvwmAuto 0 "Silent Layer 2" "Silent Layer default"

There is a similar solution for 2.2.* using a function with Style and
Recapture, but I don't suggest it at all.

Mikhael.

Well, this work as documented in both 2.2.5 and 2.3.32, i.e. if the key is
pressed twice quickly, the focus is flipped between the two last windows.
But if you use SloppyFocus or MouseFocus, you may not notice this, because
the focus returns immediately to the current window. Use ClickToFocus
focusing model to see it straight. I will update this man page sentence.

Or maybe a better example for double press should be found, since now this
example is a bit redudant, in 2.3 versions the same result is achieved
automatically using SelectOnRelease, a double click action is not needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

In the 2.3.x betas:

All [!iconic] iconify

Somehow, I don't think this is what you want.
For me, the command iconified my clock and mail notifier.
You probably want to add other conditions, like:

All [!iconic !sticky] iconify

Hi everybody,

we are developing a kind of Kiosk over FVWM. Now I would like to =
perform
some 'strange' functionality:
1.- I have one window with the main buttons of my kiosk app.
2.- I have another window with plaympeg running some videos.
3.- The video window must stay on top as long as the user doesn't push =
any
button of the main window (the user can see the buttons because the =
main
window is elarged to the size of the screen, and the video window is
smaller, and plaed on the top-left corner).
4.- What I don't want is the video window to move back if the user =
clicks on
any visible part of the main window that doesn't belong to the =
buttons...

I have tried to set the video window style to sticky, but I doesn't =
seem to
work (I suppose that the thing that does not work is my brain ;-)

Best regards and thanks evrybody in advance,

Miguel =C1ngel

Could you please be a bit more specific? ;-)

 - What version did you before the update?
 - Can you please strip down your config file so that above
   messages are still generated and post it to the list?

I assume this is some kind of quoting problem.  Some details in
fvwm's command line parser have changed a few times in the recent
past and your config file may contain a few lines that have worked
only with some 2.3.x versions and will not work in the future.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I can confirm this.

That is because the FvwmWinList has nothing to do with menus.
Probably the "Transient" option was never used by anyone so that
this was never noticed before.

> How can I change that behaviour of the FvwmWinList ?

Download the current CVS stuff or download 2.3.33 when it is
released.  I will commit a fix in a few moments that makes
placement of the module window more like placement of menus.

With 2.3.x you can use the same conditions as for the "Current"
command in addition to the usual parameters:

  WindowList (CurrentPage vim*) ...

Using 2.2.x you have to change the style of the window and
recapture it with RecaptureWindow.  In 2.3.x you can simply use
the Layer command.  The normal window layer is 4 and the
StaysOnTop layer is 6:

  Layer 0 4

or

  Layer 0 6

Just a remark on the syntax:

> All [!iconic] iconify

The same can be achieved with

  All iconify on

without fiddling with contitions.  For clarity of the man page
contitions should be placed in parentheses, but the old syntax
with square brackets is still supported:

  All (!iconic) iconify on

The second version saves a few CPU cycles.  Although it seems
superfluous, adding the 'on' to the Iconify command makes it a
little more fault tolerant.  Iconifying windows is an asynchronous
operation between X server and fvwm and in very rare situations
both disagree about the state of the window for a split second.
So a window that was just iconified might be deiconified with a
plain "Iconify" (which is a toggle) but not with "Iconify on".

Not really, but I guess your problem is that these windows cover
other windows with more interesting contents.  The solution to
this problem is to tell fvwm to keep these windows below all
others.  Just put this into your config file:

  Style <name_of_the_sticky_window> StaysOnBottom

You will need 2.3.x for this to work, though.  In 2.2.x you can
not change this.  This option is switched on by default for
Exceed, but I guess nobody bothered about Reflection X yet.

Could you please elaborate what this "Origin" does?  Does it have
something to do with window placement?

  considering this and the StaysOnTop style <-> command issue I really

Dear List,

Will the above style work with Fvwm2.2.2 ????

I know this is an old version, but I am having trouble upgrading.

I'm using fvwm CVS for about several month.
This problem arise recently when I do cvs up and install new version.
It is (problem) still present in today's snapshot.

Here is minimal fvwm config file:

IconFont  labelb


Here is log entries:
_IceTransOpen: Unable to Parse address xsm
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset labelb, trying 'fixed'
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset labelb, trying 'fixed'
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset labelb, trying 'fixed'
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset labelb, trying 'fixed'


I'm sure fontname is valid, because next command works fine
$ xedit -fn labelb

It's worked fine about two weeks ago.

Using IconFont "labelb" doesn't help.

Hi,

thanks very much Dominik Vogt. We are working with 2.2.4 realease, so I
followed your instructions for the given version...

I works OK, I have set in my .fvwm2rc the following options:

Style * ClickToFocus
GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntRaise

I was a little afraid, because the window for the video is usually =
killed
by the main app (i.e., main window) and yoou told me that the =
FvwmCommand
"Next..." could be problematic... but till now it seems to work ok... I =
did
not even need to install the FvwmCommandS module, neither call "Next" =
or
"Layer" command from the shell...

If anybody needs more explanations about my problem and how did I solve =
(ok,
in fact it was Dominik Vogt the one who gave me the solution, THANKS A =
LOT),
just tell me...

Best regards

Miguel =C1ngel

StaysOnBottom is introduced in 2.3.1, but StaysOnTop works fine in 2.2.2.

The 2.3.x releases are now very stable.  Go for it.

Paul,  would you mind sending us the "vendor string"
for Reflection X?  This way we can fix this without anyone having
to change their config file.

At the command line, type "xdpyinfo".  Send us the exact output.

I suggest not to write to me personally. I may be busy, not get an email
(I have mail problems from time to time) or just may not know the answer.
And others on the list may want to hear the answer too.

Ok, but this was not easily understandable from the original message.
You wanted "the focused window to stay on top". :-)

2.2 versions are not good for this. I know how to solve this in 2.2 (using
$w, PipeRead, xwininfo, grep, cut), but I don't want to suggest hacks.
The proper solution for the individual window styles will be after 2.5.0.

This particular problem is solvable in 2.3 and there are 2 solutions,
the first using Style (not relable) and the second using Layer command:

  AddToFunc ApplyStyleOnTheCurrentWindow
  + I Style $n $0          # $n is already propertly quoted
  + I   # we use one of a few style options where Recapture is needed in 2.3
  + I RecaptureWindow

  Key F1 A CS Pick ApplyStyleOnTheCurrentWindow StaysOnTop
  Key F2 A CS Pick ApplyStyleOnTheCurrentWindow StaysPut
  Key F3 A CS Pick ApplyStyleOnTheCurrentWindow StaysOnBottom

  Key F5 A CS Layer 0 12
  Key F6 A CS Layer default    # by default, default=4
  Key F7 A CS Layer 0 0

Yes, FvwmAuto applies its enter-focus and leave-focus commands to any
current window automatically, not only to one specific window.

You probably want to send this to majordomo@fvwm.org.  You are mailing

I am running the latest version of AIX (4.3.3) and the default X11
configuration that was installed on my machine with AIX.  I am now trying
to install fvwm, and running into problems.  Although configuration would
succeed, compilation would fail on a missing shape.h, which is an X11
extension.  Simply adding the file is useless, since you would be trading
a compilation error for a linking error.  I tried using the
--disable-shape option, which worked for fvwm itself, allowing it to
compile, but none of the extras would compile without it.  I also later
installed xpm, and now fvwm itself won't compile, I suspect because the
xpm requires these extra libraries.  After much google research, I found
that shape.h is associated with libXext, and that the X11 setup included
in AIX lacks several of teh extensions and libraries included in a normal
X11 install.  Attempts to find a patch or update to bring AIX up to speed,
as well as attempts to find a full X11 AIX binary failed.  Short of
reinstalling X11 myself, does anyone have any ideas for what could be done
to fix this problem?


Thanks,

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "xload15" `Exec xload \
      -title xload15 -nolabel -bg rgb:90/80/90 -update 15 &`)

  The last lines are a little tricky - one spawns an FvwmPager
  module, and captures it to display in a quadruple width but-
  ton.  is used, the Pager will be as big as  possible  within
  the button's relief

  The final line is even more magic. Note the  combination  of
  UseOld  and  NoKill,  which  will try to swallow an existing
  window with the name "xload15" when starting up (if failing:
  starting  one  with the specified command), which is unswal-
  lowed when ending FvwmButtons

  The other panels are specified after the root panel:

  *FvwmButtonsPanel WinOps
  *FvwmButtonsBack bisque2
  *FvwmButtonsGeometry -3-3
  *FvwmButtonsColumns 1

  *FvwmButtons(Title Resize,Icon resize.xpm ,Action Resize)
  *FvwmButtons(Title Move  ,Icon arrows2.xpm,Action Move  )
  *FvwmButtons(Title Lower ,Icon Down       ,Action Lower )
  *FvwmButtons(Title Raise ,Icon Up         ,Action Raise )

  *FvwmButtonsPanel Tools
  *FvwmButtonsBack bisque2
  *FvwmButtonsGeometry -1-1
  *FvwmButtonsColumns 1

  *FvwmButtons(Title Kill  ,Icon bomb.xpm   ,Action Destroy)

  The color specification rgb:90/80/90 is  actually  the  most
  correct  way  of  specifying  independent  colors  in X, and
  should be used instead of the older #908090. If  the  latter
  specification is used in your configuration file, you should
  be sure to escape the hash in any of the commands which will
  be  executed,  or  fvwm will consider the rest of the line a
  comment

  Note that with the x/y geometry specs you can  easily  build
  button  windows  with gaps. Here is another example. You can
  not accomplish this without geometry specs for the buttons:

<h2>FvwmCommand</h2>
<b><big>FvwmCommand [-mrv] [-w time] [-S name] [-i level] [-f name] [-F =
level] [command...]</big></b>
<p>FvwmCommand lets you monitor fvwm2 transaction and issue
fvwm2 command from a shell command line or scripts.
<pre>
arguments
  -F level: 0, 2
  -f name: name of FIFO
  -i level: 0, 1, 2, 3
  -m: monitor
  -r: wait for reply
  -s name: name of server
  -w micro-seconds
  -v: version
</pre>
<h4>WRAPPER</h4>
FvwmCommand.sh has bourne shell function definitions to keep
the syntax similar to fvwm2 configuration file. This file is
to be sourced:
<pre>
  . FvwmCommand.sh
  DesktopSize 5x5
</pre>
FvwmCommand.pm is for perl in order to keep the syntax similar
to fvwm2 configuration file. Commas can be used to separate Fvwm2
commands' arguments.
<pre>
  use FvwmCommand;
  if( $ARGV[0] eq 'home' ) {
      Desk 0,0; GotoPage '1 1';
  }elsif( $ARGV[0] eq 'jump' ) {
      Desk "0 2"; GotoPage 0, 1;
  }
</pre>
Although arguments in FvwmCommand are not case sensitive as
fvwm2, the functions defined in FvwmCommand.sh and
FvwmCommand.pl are case sensitive.
<h2>FvwmConsole</h2>
FvwmConsole allows the user to type fvwm configuration commands
interactively, and have them executed immediately.
This tool is particularly useful for testing new configuration
ideas, or for implementing temporary changes to your
environment. The command "killme" terminates FvwmConsole.
<pre>
Module FvwmConsole -g 40x10 -fg black -bg green3
Module FvwmConsole -e /usr/X11/lib/fvwm2/FvwmConsoleC.pl
</pre>
<h2>FvwmCpp file</h2>
When called, this module will attempt to have /usr/lib/cpp
pre-process the file specified in its invocation, and then
have fvwm read the resulting file.
<p>FvwmCpp can be invoked by inserting the line 'FvwmCpp' in
the .fvwm2rc file. It can also be called from a menu or
mouse binding. If the user wants his entire .fvwm2rc file
pre-processed with FvwmCpp, then fvwm should be invoked as:
<pre>
   fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp .fvwm2rc"

   Some options can be specified on the command line:

   -cppopt option
     Lets you pass an option to the cpp program. Not really
     needed as any unknown options will be passed on
     automatically.

   -cppprog name
     Instead of invoking "/usr/lib/cpp", fvwm will invoke name.

   -outfile filename
     Instead of creating a random unique name for the temporary
     file for the preprocessed rc file, this option
     will let you specify the name of the temporary file it
     will create.

   -debug
     Causes the temporary file create by Cpp to be retained.
     This file is usually called "/tmp/fvwmrcXXXXXX"

   FvwmCpp defines some values for use in the pre-processor file:

     TWM_TYPE
       Always set to "fvwm".

     SERVERHOST
       The name of the machine running the X Server.

     CLIENTHOST
       The name of the machine running fvwm.

     HOSTNAME
       The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally the
       same as CLIENTHOST.

     OSTYPE
       The operating system for CLIENTHOST.

     USER
       The name of the person running fvwm.

     VERSION
       The X11 version.

     REVISION
       The X11 revision number.

     VENDOR
       The X server vendor.

     RELEASE
       The X server release number.

     WIDTH
       The screen width in pixels.

     HEIGHT
       The screen height in pixels.

     X_RESOLUTION
       Some  distance/pixel measurement for the horizontal
       direction, I think.

     Y_RESOLUTION
       Some distance/pixel measurement for the vertical direction, I =
think.

     PLANES
       Number of color planes for the X server display

     BITS_PER_RGB
       Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

     CLASS
       The X11 visual class, ie PsuedoColor.

     COLOR
       Yes or No, Yes if the display class is neither StaticGrey
       or GreyScale.

     FVWM_VERSION
       The fvwm version number, ie 2.0

     OPTIONS
       Some combination of SHAPE, XPM, NO_SAVEUNDERS, and Cpp,
       as defined in configure.h at compile time.

     FVWM_MODULEDIR
       The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and modules
       by default, as determined at compile time.

<h2>FvwmDebug</h2>
The FvwmDebug captures the stream of module packets coming
from fvwm, and displays them on stderr.
<h2>FvwmEvent</h2>
FvwmEvent is a more versatile replacement for FvwmAudio. It
can in general be used to hook any fvwm2 function or program
to any window manager event. E.g: Delete unwanted netscape-
popups or application error popups as they appear, play
sounds, log events to a file and the like.

<h2>FvwmForm form-name</h2>
FvwmForm provides a mechanism to get user input and act
accordingly. This is achieved by means of a form that the
user can fill out, and from which the user can select
actions he wants Fvwm to take. A form consists of five
types of items: text labels, single-line text inputs,
mutually-exclusive selections, multiple-choice selections,
and action buttons. These items are arranged into several
lines, with a very flexible layout.

<h2>FvwmIconMan</h2>
FvwmIconMan is an icon manager modeled after the TWM icon

<h4>EXAMPLE</h4>
<pre>
  This first example is of a the simplest invocation of FvwmIconMan,
  which only has one manager, and handles all windows:

  # Make FvwmIconMan  title-bar-less, sticky, and give it an icon
  Style "Fvwm*"       Icon toolbox.xpm,NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky
  Style "FvwmIconMan" HandleWidth 5, Handles, BorderWidth 5

  #Definitions used by the modules
  *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers        1
  *FvwmIconMan*resolution         global
  *FvwmIconMan*background         slategrey
  *FvwmIconMan*foreground         white

  *FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry     100x0
  *FvwmIconMan*managergeometry    1x0-0+0

  This example is the Reader's Digest version of  my  personal
  configuration.  It  has  two managers, one for emacs and one
  for everything else, minus things with no icon  title.  Only
  windows  on  the  current page are displayed. The use of the
  drawicons and shape options requires that fvwm and FvwmIcon-
  Man  we  compiled  with  the  correct  options. Note how the
  geometry and show options are specified per manager, and the
  others are common to all:

  Style "FvwmIconMan"  NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0
  Style "FvwmIconMan"  HandleWidth 0

<h2>FvwmIdent</h2>
The FvwmIdent module prompts the user to select a target
window, if the module was not launched from within a window
context in Fvwm. After that, it pops up a window with
information about the window which was selected.

<h2>FvwmM4 file</h2>
When called, this module will attempt to have M4 pre-process
the file specified in its invocation, and then have fvwm
read the resulting file
<pre>
     FvwmM4 can be invoked by inserting the line 'FvwmM4' in  the
     .fvwm2rc  file.  It  can also be called from a menu or mouse
     binding.  If the user wants his entire  .fvwm2rc  file  pre-
     processed with FvwmM4, then fvwm should be invoked as:

          fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

     Note that the  argument  to  the  option  "-cmd"  should  be
     enclosed in quotes, and no other quoting should be used. For
     example, a typical invocation might be:

          fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwm2rc"

     Some options can be specified on the command line:

       -m4-prefix
         I think this makes all the m4 directives require the
         prefix "m4_".

       -m4opt option
         Lets you pass an option to the m4 program. Not really
         needed as any unknown options will be passed on
         automatically.

       -m4-squote character
         Lets you change the m4 start-of-quote character to
         character.

       -m4-equote character
         Lets you change the m4 end-of-quote character to
         character.

       -m4prog name
         Instead of invoking "m4", fvwm will invoke name.

       -outfile filename
         Instead of creating a random unique name for the tem-
         porary file for the preprocessed rc file, this option
         will let you specify the name of the temporary file it
         will create.

       -debug
         Causes the temporary file create by m4 to be retained.
         This file is usually called "/tmp/fvwmrcXXXXXX"

     FvwmM4 defines some values  for  use  in  the  pre-processor
     file:

       TWM_TYPE
         Always set to "fvwm".

       SERVERHOST
         The name of the machine running the X Server.

       CLIENTHOST
         The name of the machine running fvwm.

       HOSTNAME
         The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally the
         same as CLIENTHOST.

       OSTYPE
         The operating system for CLIENTHOST.

       USER
         The name of the person running fvwm.

       VERSION

       REVISION
         The X11 revision number.

       VENDOR
         The X server vendor.

       HEIGHT
         The screen height in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION
         Some distance/pixel measurement for the horizontal
         direction, I think.

       Y_RESOLUTION
         Some distance/pixel measurement for the vertical
         direction, I think.

       PLANES
         Number of color planes for the X server display

       BITS_PER_RGB
         Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

       CLASS
         The X11 visual class, ie PsuedoColor.

       COLOR
         Yes or No, Yes if the display class is neither StaticGrey
         or GreyScale.

       FVWM_VERSION
         The fvwm version number, ie 2.0

       OPTIONS
         Some combination of SHAPE, XPM, NO_SAVEUNDERS, and  M4,
         as defined in configure.h at compile time.

       FVWM_MODULEDIR
         The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and  modules
         by default, as determined at compile time.

<h2>FvwmRearrange arguments</h2>
This module can be called to tile or cascade windows.
<pre>
FvwmRearrange -tile -h 10 10 90 90
FvwmRearrange -cascade -resize 10 2 80 70

 arguments:
    -a
      Causes all window styles to be affected, even ones with
      the WindowListSkip style.

    -cascade
      Cascade windows. This argument must be the first on the
      command line. This is the default.

    -desk
      Causes all windows on the desk to be cascaded/tiled
      instead of the current screen only.

    -flatx
      Inhibits border width increment. Only used when cascading.

    -flaty
      Inhibits border height increment. Only used when cascading.

    -h
      Tiles horizontally (default is to tile vertically).
      Used for tiling only.

    -incx arg
      Specifies a horizontal increment which is successively
      added to cascaded windows. arg is a percentage of
      screen width, or pixel value if a p is suffixed.
      Default is zero. Used only for cascading.

    -incy arg
      Specifies a vertical increment which is successively
      added to cascaded windows. arg is a percentage of
      screen height, or pixel value if a p is suffixed.
      Default is zero. Used only for cascading.

    -m
      Causes maximized windows to also be affected (implied by -all).

    -mn arg
      Tiles up to arg windows in tile direction. If more
      windows exist, a new direction row or column is created
      (in effect, a matrix is created). Used only when tiling
      windows.

    -noraise
      Inhibits window raising, leaving the depth ordering
      intact.

    -noresize
      Inhibits window resizing, leaving window sizes intact.
      This is the default when cascading windows.

    -nostretch
      If tiling: inhibits window growth to fit tile. Windows
      are shrunk to fit the tile but not expanded.

      If cascading: inhibits window expansion when using the
      -resize option. Windows will only shrink to fit the
      maximal width and height (if given).

    -r
      Reverses the window sequence.

    -resize
      Forces all windows to resize to the constrained width
      and height (if given). This is the default when tiling
      windows.

    -s
      Causes sticky windows to also be affected (implied by -all).

    -t
      Causes transient windows to also be affected (implied by -all).

    -tile
      Tile windows. This argument must be the first on the
      command line.

    -u
      Causes untitled windows to also be affected (implied by -all).

<h2>FvwmSave</h2>
When called, this module will attempt to save your current
desktop layout into a file called new.xinitrc. Ideally, this
file will look just like .xinitrc, but in reality, you will
have to edit it to get a useable configuration, so be sure
to keep a backup of your old .xinitrc.
During initialization, NoClutter will eventually search a
configuration file which describes the time-outs and actions
to take. The configuration file is the same file that fvwm
used during initialization.
<p>
If the NoClutter executable is linked to another name, ie ln
-s NoClutter OtherClutter, then another module called Other-
Clutter can be started, with a completely different confi-
guration than NoClutter, simply by changing the keyword
NoClutter to OtherClutter. This way multiple clutter-
reduction programs can be used.
<p>NoClutter can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module
NoClutter' in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on a line
by itself, if NoClutter is to be spawned during fvwm's ini-
tialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse button or
keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to locate NoClutter.
<p>NoClutter reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it
starts up, and looks for lines similar to "*NoClutter 3600
Iconify". The format of these lines is
<pre>
  *NoClutter [time] [command]
</pre>
where command is any fvwm built-in command, and
time is the time in seconds between when a window looses
focus and when the command is executed. At most 3 actions
can be specified.
<h2>FvwmSaveDesk</h2>
When called, this module will attempt to save your current
desktop layout as a definition of extra lines for the function
InitFunction into the file .fvwm2desk in your home
directory. As explain in the other documation, this function
is called at startup of fvwm2. You have to include this
file in .fvwm2rc after the definition of the Function Init-
function. You can do this by using the module FvwmM4 or
FvwmCpp.
<p>The M4 Macro processor substitutes its macros  even  in  the
middle of a word. Because of that you may have problems with
predefined macros such as include or define. To avoid this
the GNU M4 has an extra option to prefix all builtins with
'm4_'. FvwmM4 can be called with option -m4-prefix and then
will provide the option -P to M4. I personally use the
FvwmM4 module this way.
<pre>
  fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc"
</pre>
Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwm2rc:
<Pre>
  m4_include(`.fvwm2desk') .
</pre>
<p>You may have the problem that the preprocessor directives
starts with the comment charakter '#' and
 will complain about unknown directives, if you have comments
 in your .fvwm2rc.
<pre>
  fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp -C-I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc"
</pre>
Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwm2rc:
<pre>
  #include ".fvwm2desk"
</pre>
<h2>FvwmScript file</h2>
FvwmScript is a module which allows to build many graphical
applications such as desktop accessories, button panel with
popup menu, modal dialog... At the startup, FvwmScript reads
the file which is specified in the command line. This file
contains the script. This script is not included in the
configuration file of Fvwm.
<p>See the man page for the gory details.
<h2>FvwmScroll</h2>
The FvwmScroll module prompts the user to select a target
window, if the module was not launched from within a window
context in Fvwm. After that, it adds scroll bars to the
selected window, to reduce the total desktop space consumed
by the window.
<pre>
*FvwmScrollFore color
*FvwmScrollBack color
</pre>
<h2>FvwmTalk</h2>
The FvwmTalk allows the user to type fvwm commands into a
window, and have them executed immediately. These commands
are usually specfified in the .fvwmrc file, or are bound to
menu/mouse items as specified in that file. This tools is
particularly useful for testing new configuration ideas, or
for implementing temporary changes to your environment.
<h2>FvwmTaskBar</h2>
The FvwmTaskBar module provides a taskbar made up of buttons
arranged by rows, each corresponding to a window that FVWM
is managing. Clicking on first button gives focus to the
corresponding toplevel window; clicking on the middle button
will hide a toplevel window; third mouse button is reserved
for a future extension (context menu). Like the other
modules, FvwmTaskBar only works when fvwm is used as the
window manager.

Since fvwm knows nothing about the contents of a window you have
to teach the buttons to explicitly raise or lower the windows.

 - Place the main window below the video window at first.

 - Use ClickToFocus on both windows and make sure that clicking
   in the window does not raise them:

     Style * ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaisesOff

   for 2.3.x or

     Style * ClickToFocus
     GlobalOpts ClickToFocusClickDoesntRaise
    
   for 2.2.x.

 - Make sure that the windows get no decorations or if they do
   that fo raise/lower actions are bound to any part of the
   decorations.

 - Start the FvwmCommandS module when fvwm starts up.

 - Now, make the buttons on the main window trigger this shell
   command in addition to whatever they normally do:

     FvwmCommand "Next (main_window_name) Raise"

   And for the hypothetical "Show video" button:

     FvwmCommand "Next (main_window_name) Lower"

This will not work too well if any of the windows are ever
closed and reopened.  In this case I recommend you the "Layer"
command of 2.3.x instead of Raise and lower:

  Raise -> Layer 0 6
  Lower -> Layer 0 2

I'd be interested to get feedback if you get this working.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

WindowList calls function WindowListFunc, which among other commands calls
WarpToWindow with parameters (see the man page unless you redefined it).
You may call your own function as a doucle click/double press action too.

I ran into similar problems with AIX  compiling another X application.
The  libraries were initially missing but  our support staff found and
installed them.  Unfortunatly, I don't remember what they had to do.

On my AIX 4.3 system, I see libXext.a in:

monstro> find /usr/lpp/X11/lib -name 'libXext*' -print
/usr/lpp/X11/lib/R6/libXext.a
/usr/lpp/X11/lib/R6/inst_updt/libXext.a
/usr/lpp/X11/lib/R5/libXext.a

Hope that helps.

No, I mean fvwm itself.  If there is a memory leak, Purify might
be able to detect it.

Uhm, if you are talking about desktops, ...Rows and ...Columns
are the right setting.  Try this:

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPager*
  *FvwmPagerRows 2
  *FvwmPagerColumns 3
  Module FvwmPager 0 5

If you are talking about pages, not desktops, you can set the
desktop geometry:

  DesktopSize 3x2

BTW, we have a nice mailing list also:  fvwm@fvwm.org.  Please do
not send configuration questions to the bug tracking system.

I suggest you fetch a more recent copy of fvwm.  The latest beta
(2.3.32) should properly detect the absence of the shape extension
and compile without it.  Once you got it up and running you may
want to read question 2.2 of the fvwm FAQ about running fvwm under
CDE.

That is a matter of the configuration of your X server.  Fvwm
knows abot eight modifiers: Shift (S), Control (C), Lock (L)
and Mod1 (1) to Mod5 (5).  Meta (M) is simply hardcoded as a
shortcut for Mod1 (1).  To find out which modifier is bound to the
meta key, issue the shell command

  $ xmodmap

This produces some output like this:

  xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):
  
  shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
  lock      
  control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
  mod1        Meta_L (0x40)
  mod2      
  mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
  mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
  mod5      

As you see, my 'Meta' key (which is actually the 'Alt' key on my
keyboard) is associated with Mod1, so for me, the following are
equivalent:

  Mouse 1 R 1 Menu RootMenu

and

  Mouse 1 R M Menu RootMenu

Also, the Meta key may have a different name on Sun keyboards.
Perhaps someone with a Sun workstation can tell you its name.  If
you want to be able to use 'M', you can change the modifiers with
'xmodmap' too (try "man xmodmap").

  run xev, it will tell you the keycode and keysym, you can change
keysym (or add it, if key does not have any) using xmodmap (see man
modmap).

learning, download and install Jamie Zawinski's excellent xkeycaps

Thanks to those who responded. Indeed, "BugOpts 
RaiseOverNativeWindows on" works quite nicely with fvwm 2.3.32.

Dan, the relevant output of xdpyinfo for (this version, at 
least) Reflection X:
...
version number:    11.0
vendor string:    WRQ, Inc.
vendor release number:    8
maximum request size:  4194300 bytes
...

Cheers to all,

  how is it excellent? I find it completely useless...

  xev reports all the keys (and mouse) without any fuss. xkeycaps do not
even work unless you select exactly the same keyboard as you actually
have (of course the logitech keyboard that I have is missing).

  from my investigation the proper way to handle this is using XKEYBOARD
extension, which xkeycaps doesn't seem to be using. I have found the
exact keyboard in the /etc/X11/xkb/... tree, set that up as keyboard
model in XF86Config-4 and all the keys worked (including extra keys for
audio and internet). very simple and no fussing with xmodmap (or
xkeycaps)... don't have to make sure xmodmap is run (during different
ways to start X) etc...

Thanks Paul.  I applied the a change to current CVS.  After that change
you shouldn't need BugOpts with Reflection X.

Are you sure these fonts exist and are in the font path of your X
server?  The names "label", "labelb" and "menu" seem funny to me.
Please check if these names appear in the output of

  $ xlsfonts

If they do exist, the X server can't load them for some reason.
According to the warnings, fvwm does not seem to do anything
wrong.

Well,

  $ xedit -fn kldsfldshlf

works for me too.  It simply uses a different font.

Did you make any changes to the X server setup?

This is often happens if you have broken c++ instalation. Try:

  ./configure --without-cxx

Or better yet, install fvwm-2.3.33, which does not use C++ and has much
less problems overall than fvwm-2.2.5.

Is there a way (in the fvwm2rc file) to turn off the little pop-up that 
occurs when you move a window on screen?  Or does anyone know where in 
the source I can turn that off if there's no other way?

Hi,

Yes there is a way to control this behaviour.
>From the fvwm2 man page:

HideGeometryWindow [Never|Move|Resize]
   
Hides the position or size window that is usually
shown when a window is moved  or  resized  interac­
tively.   To  switch it off only for move or resize
operations the optional parameters Move and  Resize
can  be used respectively.  To switch both on again
use the Never option.


Regards,

Richard

I've found the source of problem.

That's not in X, that in fvwm.

If I configure fvwm with --disable-multibyte, all OK.
If I configure fvwm with --enable-multibyte, it starts complaining as
shown above.


I was suggested to --enable-multibyte to properly display GTK+ titles.
But thats caused this new problem.

This does not work with 2.2.x, you need the latest 2.3.x beta
release.

I think you can do that, but I think writing a regular application is
better suited. As far as I know, a fvwm module should do something
about window management, nothing less or more.

The only explanation I can think of is that these fonts do not
support your locale.  If this is the case, setting

  $ export LANG=C
  $ export LC_CTYPE=""

before fvwm is started, the font should work again - at the cost
of not being able to display localised glyphs in window titles.
It seems that the "multibyte" code is not able to handle
multiple locales simultaneously and I don't understand how this
can be done in X.  So, your options are: don't use the multibyte
option and live with non-localised window titles.  Or use
different fonts that support your locale.

To summarize:
1. I see localised window titles of most apps (like GVim),
except mozilla/galeon with --disable-mb. If I build fvwm with
--enable-mb then _all_ window titles looks just fine, BUT fvwm complains
about my fonts as "invalid".

2. All looks fine under blackbox wm.


Thanks for the help anyway.

It is hard to understand the real intention from the question, but I think
Arie is not interesting in writting a new module and ICQ application, but
in configuring existing fvwm module and ICQ application.

There are modules FvwmButtons and FvwmWharf (see their man pages) that may
swallow a mini ICQ applet (say, 64x64 pixels, if you have one) or include
an ICQ icon, which can be used to launch the app, like in this screenshot:

  http://fvwm.org/screenshots/Tenebrae-desk-800x600.gif

If this answer does not help, alaborate on the question.

Mikhael.

This seems to have fixed it.  I am using the gcc package from
www.sunfreeware.com.  I guess that package is broken.

Not necessarily.

On Solaris, using the -L option to specify where to find shared
libraries is not enough.  That will help the compile-time linker ld(1)
find them, but it won't set the path for the run-time linker ld.so(1) to
find them.

On Solaris, when dealing with shared libraries that appear in
non-standard places, you also must use the -R option to set the run-time
link path.


If your installation of GCC uses a shared stdc++ (standard C runtime)
then you likely will need to add a -R flag to your compile line telling
the linker where to look.

For example, if your compiler installs its shared libraries in
/opt/gcc-2.95.2/lib, then you would do this:

  $ cd fvwm-2.2.5
  $ make clean
  $ rm config.cache
  $ LDFLAGS="-R/opt/gcc-2.95.2/lib" ./configure ...
  $ make

and that should work.


Whether it's this installation of GCC that is broken or whether it is
this behavior of Solaris that is broken, is an exercise for the reader.

That does not work.  It still thinks my C++ compiler is a cross-compiler,
and breaks during the configure.

You're sure you used the right directory, right?  My example was just
that: an example.  I don't have the first idea where these files reside
on your system.  Look in the directory you provided via -R; you should
see a file libstdc++.so.<some-stuff> there.  If not, you don't have the
right directory.

In order to debug this further we'd need to see what configure prints
into config.log when it decides that the C++ compiler is a
cross-compiler.

Odd, I used:

LDFLAGS="-R/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-solaris2.8/2.95.2" ./configure

Which has libstdc++.so (a link) but not libstdc++.so.2.10.0.  The
libstdc++.so.2.10.0 file is in /usr/local/lib, but libstdc++.so is
not.  The following did work:

LDFLAGS="-R/usr/local/lib" ./configure

Perhaps this could be auto-configured when compiling on x86.  Is
this still necessary with the beta version of fvwm?

Hey, that's mine!  :)
That's an FvwmButtons thang:

*FvwmButtons(Title licq, Icon licq-icon-sun.xpm, \
             Action 'Exec "licq" licq &')

I suck at fvwm configuration and just did search and replace type stuff
with the default fvwm95 rc file from ages ago.  Hey, if it works...
Trial and error.  :)

Only thing I have a problem with is odd eterm errors every now and then,
and I think it's fvwmtaskbar gradually taking up all my memory over time.

I don't see how configure could really know what the right path would
be.

Anyway, this isn't an x86 issue, it's a Solaris issue.  Solaris on SPARC
behaves the same way.

And, finally, if this issue can be resolved it really this issue needs
to be resolved by autoconf itself.  Possibly if/when we switch to the
next official autoconf (2.50) in FVWM, this won't be an issue (I don't
know; I haven't tried it--I _do_ know they fixed the cross-compiler
stuff so you won't see the confusing message you did here, but instead
something like "Can't find a working C++ compiler" or similar... because
I, among others, abused the autoconf folks until they changed it :).

  ddn> Is this still necessary with the beta version of fvwm?

Maybe.  The next release of FVWM doesn't need a C++ compiler at all, so
this particular manifestation doesn't exist.


However, you could run into the same issue with other shared libraries:
say you installed libXpm.so or the stroke or readline or whatever
libraries in directories other than the standard system directories;
then you need to add -R to get the run-time linker to look there as
well.

From: Barry Margolin <barmar@genuity.net>

I recently switched from twm to fvwm 2.2.4.  I'm using the FvwmWinList
module to replace the twm Icon Manager.  In twm I used the SortIconManager
command, is there any way to get the FvwmWinList module to keep its list
sorted in a predictable way?  It seems to default to adding windows at the
end of the list, although if I close the module and restart it they end up
in a pretty random order.

The WindowList command has an Alphabetic option, but I want a permanent
list of windows, not a temporary pop-up.

Last month I asked this question in the comp.windows.x.apps newsgroup, and
someone sent me the suggestion:

AddToFunc WL-Func "I" WindowList Alphabetic

I tried this but it didn't do anything AFAICT.

Had anyone actually tried using fvwm2 on cygwin/xfree86?

It seems to work, but I am having trouble getting the alt key to really
work.  I have it set-up so that the mouse button 1 and the alt key will move
the window:
Mouse 1 WTFSI M Move 

This works via my vncserver (a xfree86 port), but not on cygwin/xfree86.

I'm not convinced that this is a fvwm problem, I am just wondering if
someone has seen this.

BTW, I am seeing something strange in xev (under cygwin), but the
cygwin/xfree86 folks seem to think it is okay.  I run xev, and when I press
and hold a modifier (any one, not just alt) it repeats like any other key
(say, the letter "m").  I don't know if this is contributing to the problem
or not, other programs seem to understand that I hit, say "alt-q" instead of
just "q" (like vim).

Is this enough to go on?  Thanks.

I'd like to be able to compute the default value for a field in FvwmForm
dynamically.  Specifically, I'd like it to default to the last response.  I
can have the command that the form runs save the value to a file, but I
haven't figured out a way to get it to read back in the next time the form
is used.  Anyone have an idea?

I just checked some of the traffic on comp.windows.x.apps.
I normally stick to comp.windows.x and I missed your questions.

As Paul indicated, its better to ask here.

I think FvwmIconMan is closer to what you are looking for.

Since you are just starting, you will be much better off using a current
beta.  Never fear, its stable.

Whoa, serious deja vu! :)

Not trying to be snippy, but didn't we already have a long thread about
this last month or so, Barry?

Same answer, download the current beta.

FvwmForm-Rlogin

is an example.

Theres some discussion about modules reading their config files
in the newsgroup.  Most modules only deal with configuration
thats been stored up before they are invoked, but thats no longer
strictly true.  A module can ask for config lines to be sent
after it is active.

I'd try commenting out all the lines like:

*FvwmTaskBarStartName Start
*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu Start

...and other related entries.  But I could be wrong.
In fact, I probably am.
Er...
Just scrap the fvwm95-based rc file and get a decent one from someone
else?

Is there an fvwm variable set to the screen height and width?

Or do I have to contrive with m4 to set this up with SetEnv?

And is there a mechanism to do arithmetic in fvwm or must I
resort to PipeRead?

   Not trying to be snippy, but didn't we already have a long thread about

Yes.  I was told that the right place to ask was the fvwm mailing list.  I
got our admins to upgrade to the latest released version, couldn't see how
to do it, so now I'm asking in the correct place.

   I think FvwmIconMan is closer to what you are looking for.

   Since you are just starting, you will be much better off using a current
   beta.  Never fear, its stable.

Yes, FvwmIconMan looks a little nicer.  If I upgrade to the beta, does it
have an option to show only icon names, like FvwmWinList does?  The names
are too long when it shows both the class and icon name (especially with
Netscape, which puts "Netscape:" at the beginning of its icon name, so
FvwmIconMan shows "Netscape: Netscape: <page title>", and the title is
mostly cut off).

Oops, that was stupid.  I should have thought about that more.  What I
should have said is: it is easy to make iconman display the icon name:

Put this in your .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmIconMan*Format "%i"

You can make it be anything you want, but I chose "%i", which is the icon
name.

see "man FvwmIconMan" for details.

   That is what iconman does, display's the icon name.  I use it, it is pretty
   cool.

For me it displays the class name *and* the icon name.  For instance, if I
run "xterm -n foo", it will display "XTerm: foo", not just "foo".

   Oops, that was stupid.  I should have thought about that more.  What I
   should have said is: it is easy to make iconman display the icon name:

   Put this in your .fvwm2rc:

   *FvwmIconMan*Format "%i"

   You can make it be anything you want, but I chose "%i", which is the icon
   name.

   see "man FvwmIconMan" for details.

Thanks.  Somehow I missed that one when I was reading through the man page.

In the 2.3.x releases, there are lots of variables including
one for height, otherwise the M4 technique or PipeRead should do.

Fvwm won't do arithmetic, but as you point out, PipeRead
will work fine.

If you are trying to place a window relative to the screen height,
you might get by with a negative geometry.

The best I could do was to make the button very small and unlabeled with:

*FvwmTaskBar: StartName

I tried the more logical:

*FvwmTaskBar: StartName ""

but that put 2 quotes in the button.

Completely not true.  I have rarely had the _exact_ keyboard, and I've
used it for many years with Data General, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX boxes,
not to mention a dizzying variety of PC keyboards.

For PC keyboards I always pick the generic 102 or 104 key keyboard that
has the right delete/enter key combo (tall/thin etc.), and it always
works fine.

KXB can do amazing things but it still requires a lot of messing around
to set up, and relying on it would make my X environment very unportable
(I still use some of those older Solaris/AIX/HP-UX boxes).

Plus, it's way overkill; all I want to do is change my CAPS LOCK key to
a CTRL key.

Fire up xkeycaps--look, my keyboard.  Or, close enough, Right-click on
the CAPS LOCK.  Oho, a menu.  "Edit Keysyms" looks interesting, but hey,
what about "Copy Keysyms"?  Just the ticket.  Choose that, click on my
CTRL key, click on my CAPS LOCK key, click the "write it out" button,
and I'm done.

Didn't have to read a single man page, didn't have to learn any
keybinding syntax, didn't have to search my system for any sample
configurations.

You can't tell me it gets any easier than that.

Whatever.  Use what you like.  Xkeycaps is an excellent program and
anyone who just wants to rebind a few keys without becoming an X
keyboard guru will love it.

Darn.  I could have sworn there was a medium-sized thread in response to
that post, discussing ways in which you could do this via PipeRead, or
rewriting config files, or all kinds of other methods.

But, it must have totally been my imagination because I can't find
anything like that in either Deja or the FVWM archives.

Strange.

I must be getting old.

Hi,

I've looked through HandleConfigureRequest() in fvwm-2.2.5/fvwm/events.c,
and I found some code that I believe to be in error.

At line 1450, the code reads:
  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->bw;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->title_height - Tmp_win->bw;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWWidth)
    width = cre->width + 2*Tmp_win->boundary_width;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWHeight)
    height = cre->height+Tmp_win->title_height+2*Tmp_win->boundary_width;

I beleve it should read:
  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWWidth)
    width = cre->width;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWHeight)
    height = cre->height;

I believe that the code is trying to account for the size of frame decorations.
However, the event sender is supposed to include all the right information in
the event already. Here is a comment from the code:

  /*
   * SetupWindow (x,y) are the location of the upper-left outer corner and
   * are passed directly to XMoveResizeWindow (frame).  The (width,height)
   * are the inner size of the frame.  The inner width is the same as the
   * requested client window width; the inner height is the same as the
   * requested client window height plus any title bar slop.
   */

I am working on a small project where correct window placement is desireable.
It's written using the Qt toolkit. The program behaves as expected under kwin,
but misbehaves under FVWM2. When I tell the pogram to move itself to
coordinates 0,0, fvwm2 puts it at -2,-18 (the size of the window
decoration at that location).

So, I have a fix in my local copy of fvwm2-2.2.5, but I would strongly prefer
to see it in the official code. Actually, last night I was ready to fix
every major window manager that did not agree with my program ;-), but I started
with fvwm2 because I use it the most. Here is the reason why I think that in
this fvwm2 is in error and not my program:

http://doc.trolltech.com/geometry.html

If you want, I can send you the source to my program to remove any doubts.
It needs Qt 2.3.x to compile (RH 7.1 has 2.3.0, but I tested it under 2.3.1
as well).

Thank you,
	Paul.

Actually, although this places the window at the right coordinates,
it screws up the size. Here is the revised fix:
  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY)
    y = cre->y;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWWidth)
    width = cre->width + 2*Tmp_win->boundary_width;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWHeight)
    height = cre->height+Tmp_win->title_height+2*Tmp_win->boundary_width;

Um, you have localised window titles *without* multibyte support
compiled in?  Then I do not understand anything about mb works with
X.  Can someone explain how this is possible?

Actually, X complains about this, not fvwm.  It would be possible
to fall back to using the "C" locale to load the font, but that
will require a major rewrite of the multibyte code (which will be
done anyway some time in the future).

> 2. All looks fine under blackbox wm.

We did claim that mb support is experimental, didn't we? ;-)

BTW, can you tell me where I can get these fonts and what your

Does the output of

  $ xmodmap

look okay?  The "Meta_L" key symbol should be mapped to Mod1.  If
not, this is probably your problem, if it is, try to find out
which key symbol is generated by the "Alt" key and use xmodmap to
tie it to Mod1.  If this does not help either I am out of ideas.

I'm using Russian and I don't ever need multibyte support. 
Cyrrilic is 8bit encoding.

$ locale
LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R
LC_CTYPE="ru_RU.KOI8-R"
LC_NUMERIC=POSIX
LC_TIME="ru_RU.KOI8-R"
LC_COLLATE="ru_RU.KOI8-R"
LC_MONETARY="ru_RU.KOI8-R"
LC_MESSAGES=C
LC_ALL=

I'm using my windows fonts *.ttf for X (Arial, Courier New, etc.).
They support a bunch of encoding like koi8, iso*.

I'm sure russian can work without any multibyte support.
For example, I compiled Vim without multibyte and it grok me fine.

If you want to write a client behaving well you should read
section 4 of the ICCCM2 which describes how window manager and
application interact properly.  For your convenience I have
attached this section.

However, this will not help here.  The ICCCM2 is too foggy about
window movement, and therefore there are applications that assume
either placement including or without the wm border.  In other
words: whatever approch we chose, it will always be incorrect for
some applications.  The pros and cons for your version are:

pro:

 1) Reading the ICCCM2 carefully it seems this approach is
    favoured.
 2) It works better with Java applications.

cons:

 3) Only few applications do it this way, so it would break more
    applications than fix.
 4) Some applications work like this: They ask the WM for a
    specific position of their client window in root coordinates,
    say (x, y).  Now, with your approach the window manager would
    place the client window at (x+bw, y+bw+th).  The application
    gets a ConfigureNotify event with the new position
    (x+..., y+...).  There are some applications that respond with
    a new ConfigureRequest (triggered by XResizeMoveWindow()) now
    requesting (x+bw, y+bw+th) as their new position.  In response
    they'll be placed at (x+2*bw, y+2*(bw+th)), and so on.  The
    windows finally wander off screen.

You see, (4) is the real reason why the approach implemented in
fvwm was chosen.  This is not hypothetical, it really has happened
a lot in the past.  Now, you could argue that an applications must
never respond to a ConfigurNotify with a ConfigureRequest (as
stated by the ICCCM2), but that does not help much.  kwin will
suffer from the described problem, and will probably switch to the
approach in fvwm one day, so I recommend you switch to placement
method referring to client window coordinates, not frame
coordinates - even at the cost of having to calculate the WM frame
geometry yourself.

Anyway, it is almost always a very bad idea to let your
application move its own windows to absolute positions on the
screen.  User will usually hate you for it.  Most of the time it
is safe to assume that the window manager will do a much better
job in placing the windows than your application since it knows
about the other windows on screen too.  Most of the applications
I saw trying that fail miserably anyway ;-)

Really, I'm only guessing.  I don't know much about how fonts work
in X.  The only thing I know is that XCreateFontList() fails with
"labelb" as the font list pattern.  The man page on that function
is hard to understand, but I think failure of this function means
that the font does not support the selected locale, i.e.
ru_RU.KOI8-R.

Actually, the name of the --enable-multibyte option is misleading.
You need it not only for multibyte support but for any encoding
other than Latin1.

I'd like to config for <control> <j|k|l|h> to move between the current desktop windows in a vi fashion based on the geometrical location of upper left corner.

Does anyone have a config for this?

The "Direction" command may do what you want:

  key j a c Direction South (currentpage) Focus
  key k a c Direction North (currentpage) Focus
  key h a c Direction West (currentpage) Focus
  key l a c Direction East (currentpage) Focus

Window selection is not based on the top left corner though, but a
complex formula that takes the corners into account as well as the
window centers.  You need 2.2.x for the Direction command.

Kind of funny, I am changing every config I can get hold of to be more
VI-like, but it never occurred to me to do this to my wm!
Here is what I came up with, and it work for me:

First, my current setting for window scrolling (pretty much the
canned setup):

# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100
Key Left        A       C2      Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C2      Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C2      Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C2      Scroll +0   +100

# VI like window scrolling
Key h           A       C       Scroll -100 +0
Key l           A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key k           A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key j           A       C       Scroll +0   +100
Key h           A       C2      Scroll -100 +0
Key l           A       C2      Scroll +100 +0
Key k           A       C2      Scroll +0   -100
Key j           A       C2      Scroll +0   +100

the last 4 in each bloc, with mod C2 allows me to get this behavior
even when the NumLock is on.  Yours may be different.

Okay, xmodmap looks okay to me, except that only Alt_L and Alt_R are present
for mod1, no meta.  But the keycode is correct.  Xvnc has all four, alt and
meta tied to mod1.  Could this be the problem?  I don't really see how, but
I'm no xmodmap expert (or X keyboard expert).

Well, after writing that paragraph, I decided to try changing the modifier
in the "Mouse" line to "mod1" instead of meta and it works.  so here is my
new line:
Mouse 1 WTFSI 1 Move

I guess I don't understand why meta won't work, but I guess that is okay.
Well, I guess because Meta_L isn't there, but I don't know quite how to fix
that without breaking anything else.  I hope that is the only problem.  I
guess we will see....

Thanks.

Does the output of

  $ xmodmap

look okay?  The "Meta_L" key symbol should be mapped to Mod1.  If
not, this is probably your problem, if it is, try to find out
which key symbol is generated by the "Alt" key and use xmodmap to
tie it to Mod1.  If this does not help either I am out of ideas.

Thanks, this is closest to what I am looking for, but I guess it will take some work.  For example if I cascade 5 xterms in the upper right hand corner:

|___1_
  |___2_
    |___3_
      |___4_
        |___5_

I expect repeating j or k to move 12345 and 54321 respectively, they don't...

actually they go 1345 and 521, like it wants to work, but something else is "attracting" the focus to the wrong window...

I added !iconic and currentdesk, it seemed to change behavior to be a little better, but still not pure "closest window center" selection.

Tried FlipFocus too, is there anyway to alter the "complex formula"?  Or at least fake it out ;+)

Version 2.2.2

thanks,

K

My application is replaying an event trail file. The trail file contrains a
list of user generated events - mouse clicks, keyboard input, window move and
resize events, focus change events, show, hide, repaint, etc.... When the
trail is replayed, the application reassembles events in the trail file into
actual events, and sends them to the event dispatcher, therefore faking user
input. So, if I record a trail where I drag my window to coordinates 0,0 on
the root window, I want the trail replay to put the window in the right spot.
However, under current fvwm2 2.2.5, the window is being placed at -2,-18.

My argument for changing fvwm2:
The application can be run under any window manager, or without a window manager
at all. Therefore, application cannot assume anything about the size of the
decoration frame. When application decides that it should be placed at a
particular location, it specifies where the decoration frame upper left corner
should be, and the dimensions of the inner frame, and does not need to know
anything about the size of decorations the window manager will put on the
window (since those can vary wildly from window manager to window manager, from
theme to theme). With this scheme, I can record my trail under one window
manager, and replay it under another window manager, and expect the window
frame upper left corner to be a 0,0.

The largest problem with what you suggested (to account for frame size inside
the application), is that my application does not know which scheme the window
manager is implementing for window placement. The only real solution to this
problem is to standardise on one scheme. Like I said, I am ready to go rewrite
every significant widnow manager out there. Which programs do you know of that
would not place right with this change? Do you really care about them? Do you
know of any other window manager that implements the same window placement
scheme as FVWM2.

Paul.

PS.
The Qt toolkit is very significant, there is a large number of new projects
being ported to Qt or written in Qt from scratch. These new programs rely on
the window placement behavior advertised by Qt, which will work under kwin,
but will fail under FVWM2 2.2.5. How long do you plan to keep FVWM2 backwards
compatible with some old programs, while not benefiting any new programs?

I myself don't use ICQ, maybe someone else on the list knows more.
I may suggest this page (just did a quick search on the web):

Dear List,

I have some good news!! Over the weekend, I upgraded by version of fvwm2
(version 2.2.2), to fvwm2 (version 2.3.28). I am finding the upgrade well
worth the experience. I still maintain that fvwm2 is the best window manager
:-).

However, I am finding that I am missing two things, which although trivial,
is annoying me :-)

I installed version 2.3.28 without touching the Makefile, except giving it
the once over, just to make sure that the path's were ok. So, all the files
have been installed in their default place.

The only thing I have changed, is the variable "ModulePath", in the per user
file ".fvwm2rc.m4" (I am still using AnotherLevel -- Lestiff style). I
changed the variable from the following:

ModulePath /usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2

to the following:

ModulePath /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.28

(I assume that is what I am supposed to do??)

The two problems that I am having, is that before I upgraded, when the WM
was loading, a round circle (referred to as "Dot") used to indicate that
various things were loading. Now, that I have upgraded, this round circle
has been replaced by a watch. How do I get the circle back???

Secondly, how do I get rid of the horizontal lines that appear on sticky
windows, AFTER the window has been iconified?? Before, sticky windows that
were iconified, never had the lines, but now they do.

Any help you can offer is very much appreciated.

On a completely separate issue, is there a way I can contribute to Fvwm2. I
know that I am not exactly fluent with the customisations of fvwm2 (it is
still early days yet!), but I just wanted to help you in some way. You have
all been very patient with my "demands", and I just feel that I would like
to help :-).

Regards,

Thomas Adam

I wonder why you took 2.3.28.  The latest beta is 2.3.33.

No, you should not change the module path.  The default path is
where the modules are istalled with "make install".  Changing the
path to something different may cause that module versions and
the fvwm version do not match.

  CursorStyle Wait dot

does the trick.

No, only by downgrading.

Technically, you can find the answer in the FAQ (5.1, 5.2).  The
best way to learn how fvwm works is to write patches and discuss
them on the workers list.  A good way to start is to look at the
list of planned enhancements and pick something that you think is
worth doing and failry simple to start with.  Or make up something
your own and discuss it on the list first.

There are a few things to keep in mind.  One is that as long as I
am developing fvwm I will keep an eye on syntax of new commands
and the coding style of new patches.  A lot of harm has been done
in the past by applying patches without checking if they fit
existing syntax or code.  The other thing is that implementing
some kinds of features are very tricky nowadays, for example
implementing new Style options.  So, don't hesitate to ask for an
explanation.  And if you want to do me a big favour, write down
a summary of the explanations you get so that we can put it
somewhere on the web page.

Bye

I think you want to do something else.

At the top of fvwm2rc.m4 there is a section which looks like 

changecom(%%%)

... snip ...

#`FVWMDIR'=FVWM_MODULEDIR
#
#`XRELEASE'=RELEASE
changecom(#)

... snip ...

ModulePath FVWM_MODULEDIR


This is the default for AnotherLevel-1.0.1-1 

I think what Dominik is telling you is that even this is overkill, as long
as you don't relocate the modules, since these paths are compiled in.

To keep things simple, I would just suggest you leave the default
AnotherLevel config in place and it should work just fine.

Tom

Ps.  You might want to note the changes with ImagePath and PixmapPath to
modify AnotherLevel though...

The 2.3.x releases contain a 2.2.x to 2.4.x conversion script.
You can use that as a guide to what should be changed in user config
files.

In the case of ModulePath, it should be deleted from user config files
since the ModulePath gets built in to fvwm now.

A similar change should be done to ImagePath.

I case you can't contribute code, just stay subscribed to the list.
Pointing out problems, answering questions, running tests are other ways
of helping.

  use xev to see keycode and keysym, if the key does not have desired
keysym use xmodmap or XKEYBOARD extension or xkeycaps to add it.

  then use xmodmap to see which modifiers you have. example:

jojda:~>xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Meta_L (0x73),  Meta_R (0x74)
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

  from the above you can see that M or 1 can be used in keybindings as
alt key, 4 can be used for META_L or META_R (I used xev to see that it's
a key with MS Windows Logo on my keyboard). see man xmodmap for more
info (search for modifier, you can clear, add or remove modifier)

  not sure if you already tried the obve, if you it does not work there
is something wrong with cygwin...

  btw as far as autorepeating of keys goes you can set it up using xset
(individually per key), so if the modifiers do the autorepeat you can
turn it of, not sure if it would help your problem though...

hi !

Is it possible to use the windows keys as modifyers? I would like to use the rightmost (menu) key in combination with cursor to change desktop pages...

Thanks !

Yup. First run xev to find out what codes are generated by that keys.
Optional use xmodmap to redefine the KeySym and the write bindings
in your rc file.

Sounds good - but my problem begins with the fvwm configuration... How do I use these Keys as Modifyers ? All I know is how they work as "normal" Keys, as in:

# Super Moves Screen left/up,
# Hyper/Menu         right/down
Key Super_R	A	N	Scroll -100000 +0
Key Super_R 	A   S   Scroll +0 -100000
Key Menu	A	N	Scroll +100000 +0
Key Menu    	A   S   Scroll +0 +100000

Does

Key Up		A   Menu Scroll .....
work ???

You have to set them up as modifiers first.  The list of defined
modifiers can be displayed with

  $ xmodmap

The output looks something like this:

  shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
  lock      
  control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
  mod1        Meta_L (0x40)
  mod2      
  mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
  mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
  mod5      

To remove key symbols from modifiers, use

  $ xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
  $ xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

To add modifiers use this syntax:

  $ xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
  $ xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
  ...

You have to restart fvwm before this works properly.

Oops. I've misunderstood you.
AFAIK there are several modifiers in X protocol. (at least,
man n bind mentions Mod[1-5] along with control and meta).
So you can try to xmodmap window key to unused one and then use it in fvwmrc.
I don't know how to do it.

Hi !

This morning I wrote :

> Is it possible to use the windows keys as modifyers? I would like to use the rightmost (menu) key in combination with cursor to change desktop pages...

Thanks to the help of Max Ischenko and Dominik Vogt ( and xkeycaps) I got the following result:

grunwalm@winlinux1: > xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
mod4        Super_L (0x73)
mod5        Super_R (0x74)


In fvwm2rc the following allows me absolute and relative positioning using cursor and Keypad:

  I already sent out this message before but I guess it was lost in
flood so here it goes again, any help appreciated:

I have set up the keyboard so that various extra keys send symbols (it's
a logitech cordless itouch keyboard). I used following option in
keyboard config part of XF86Config:

Option          "XkbModel"      "logicordless"

  xev confirms that the extra keys really generate proper symbols.

  I have set up fvwm 2.2.5 so that it does appropriate actions but it
looks like the keys for volume (XF86AudioRaiseVolume &
XF86AudioLowerVolume) are ignored. When I press them, nothing happens
(and there is nothing printed on stderr). Here's the relevant part of
fvwm config file:

...
Key XF86AudioMute        A N Exec exec amixer sset Master,0 0
Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A N Exec exec amixer sset Master,0 5%+
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume A N Exec exec amixer sset Master,0 5%-
Key XF86AudioPlay        A N Exec exec xmms -p
...

  here's what xev says:

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
root 0x32, subw 0x0, time 837538822, (178,69), root:(197,118),
state 0x0, keycode 174 (keysym 0x1008ff11, XF86AudioLowerVolume),
same_screen YES,
XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
root 0x32, subw 0x0, time 837568792, (178,71), root:(197,120),
state 0x0, keycode 176 (keysym 0x1008ff13, XF86AudioRaiseVolume),
same_screen YES,
XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

  is it possible they are ignored because of the length of symbol
string? The XF86Audio(Lower)|(Raise)Volume is the longest one I have in
fvwm config file.

  I am quite sure that they are 'strange' because when I set up
keybindings for a special key (say XF86AudioPlay) this key does not show
as XF86AudioPlay in xev output anymore but it produces following output:

FocusOut event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor

FocusIn event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1c00001,
    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor

KeymapNotify event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x0,
    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  
0   
           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  
0   

  since the volume keys still produce the keysyms in xev I guess the
keybinding was not successful (but there's nothing printed on stderr).

  the only reason I can think of is the length of keysym - the volume
keys have the longest string as keysym...

  TIA

  that key works. only the two XF86AudioRaiseVolume/XF86AudioLowerVolume
do not work, even if I bind exactly the same action as for working key.

  not only that, the bound keys do not show in xev (e.g. when I bind
XF86AudioMute it does not show with keysym XF86AudioMute un xev, see
below for details) but these two problem keys still show in xev with
their original keysyms.

  it looks like the key binding is not successfull but I get no error
message... might be time to look into source...

Hi,

I have taken some time at home and work, and did some more research, here
are my findings.

1. Problem Setup:
   Start application, move it to 0,0 coordinates of the root window, Ctrl-C it.
2. Problem Evaluation:
   Replay the trail recorded in step 1. Trail replay is considered successful
   if the upper left corner of the window manager decoration ends up at
   coordiantes (0,0), as was during trail recording.

CDE (HP-UX 10.20)     - OK
CDE (OSF1, dec alpha) - OK
CDE (Solaris 2.6)     - OK
OLWM (Solaris 2.6)    - OK
4Dwm (IRIX 6.5)       - OK
KDE 2.1.2 kwin        - OK
GNOME Sawfish         - OK
WindowMaker           - OK
FVWM2                 - failed
blackbox              - failed
AfterStep             - failed
Enligntenment         - failed

I did not test MWM, because I do not have access to it at home or at work.

As you can see, when an application requests to be placed at particular
coordinates, most popular window managers and industry standard window
manager CDE do not expect the application to account for the size of the
window decoration frame. However, FVWM2, blackbox, AfterStep and
Enlightenment all expect the application to account for the decoration size.
The end result is that there is no way to write an application using the Qt
toolkit and expect it to work correctly under CDE and FVWM2 - it's either
one or the other.

I would like to point out again, it is very important for future application
development on Unix/X11, that the window managers follow the same convention.
So far, CDE, OLWM, 4Dwm, KDE, GNOME and WindowMaker all follow the same
convention. FVWM2, blackbox, AfterStep and Enlightenment follow a different
convention. FVWM2 is in the minority.

So, have I convinced the FVWM2 maintainers to make the changes I requested
earlier? All I want is that all major window managers follow the same
convention (since ICCCM has not made it a standard). Personally, I think the
convention implemented by CDE should be followed, because CDE is the industry
standard window manager (I am one of the few running FVWM2 at work, everyone
else runs CDE 2.0).

Will you do it?

Paul.

Right.  Unfortunately, this has not happened up to date and with
all the applications that have already been written and that are
no longer maintained there is little chance of ever having a
standard.

You had better rewrite all applications to either scheme.  The
window manager can't do it right in all cases without help from
the user.  It took us roughly a year to tune the code so that it
produces acceptable results (i.e. the applications appears
roucghly in the correct spot and does not wander off screen under
any circumstances) with every application we encountered and I am
not willing to give that up to console some library authors who
do not care about the rest of the world.

I can't remember any names, but almost any program that responds
to resizing with a new ConfigurRequest that includes the position.
Searching our mail archive from 1999 should surface some names.

> Do you really care about them? Do you

Yes, absolutely.  If I have the choice to either misplace some
windows or to have some other windows wander off the screen I'll
chose the first.

I guess any off the fvwm-offspring do it this way (scwm,
afterstep, ...).  I didn't verify that, though.

What can I say?  Trolltech and KDE have done the X world a
disservice with their method of forcing bugs to become a
"standard".  While there is a slight chance that java on Unix will
one day revert to the placement behaviour described, I see little
chance that Qt will ever change.  It's so buggy, we can hardly
make a patch for every little defect.  Of course it would be
possible to make another Style option to cope with these windows,
but since Qt or Java windows don't announce the creating library
it is not possible to automatically chose the correct method.

Forever.  Over time, fvwm accumulates options for each and every
problem there ever occurs (if it can not be solved in a general
way).  However, I still have hope that these libraries revert to
the de-facto standard one day.

According to my documentation this is not even possible.
Somewhere I read that only two keys can be bound to a single
modifier.

Er, it does?  It shouldn't.  In fvwm, the modifier "M" is
synonymous to "1", so if one fails, the other one can't work
either.  Now I'm puzzled.

Try

  $ xmodmap -e "clear Mod1"
  $ xmodmap -e "add Mod1 = Meta_L Alt_L"

Ah, yes.  Cascaded windows are usually not really in a
North-South relationship.  The code divides the area around a
window into four sectors:

  \  N  /
   \   /
    \ /
  W  o  E
    / \
   /   \
  /  S  \

Any window with its center in the South sector will be preferred
to any window in the E or W sector with its center lower than the
current window.  Cascading to the bottom right is just along the
border between S and E or even already in E.  Using S here does
not give predicatable results if your window are wider than they
are tall and E fails if they are taller.  Both fail if you have
tall and wide windows.  In your case, the best solution is to use
the diagonal directions SouthEast, NorthWest, ...

  NW  |  NE
      |
      |
  ----o----
      |
      |
  SW  |  SE

The selection is base on the angle between the direction from
the window center and the lines between both window centers:

  +-----+
  |  o  |
  +-----+
     
       +-+
    +-+|2|
    |1|+-+
    +-+

Let's assume "o" has the focus.  The window centers of "1" and "2"
have exactly the same distance from "o", but since "1" deviates
0 degrees from the South direction while "2" deviates about 37
degrees.  So, "1" is chosen, not "2" - even if "2" were a bit
closer.

> Tried FlipFocus too, is there anyway to alter the "complex

Only by changing the code in the DirectionFunc() in builtins.c.
(Or CMD_Direction() in conditionals.c for 2.3.x).  We are aware
that this formula will never suit every need, but making it
configurable seemed overkill.

Why not do it the way mwm has done it:  make it configurable.  From
the mwm manual page:

positionIsFrame (class  PositionIsFrame)
                 This resource indicates how client window  posi-
                 tion information (from the WM_NORMAL_HINTS prop-
                 erty and from configuration requests) is  to  be
                 interpreted.  If the resource value is True, the
                 information is interpreted as  the  position  of
                 the  mwm  client  window  frame. If the value is
                 False, it is interpreted as being  the  position
                 of  the  client  area of the window. The default
                 value of this resource is True.


In fvwm, it might even be a Style, seeing that not all applications
behave the same.

Yes, I noticed that too.  How is that controled?  I assume by the X server,
since xmodmap on both Solaris and OSF4 say that 4 keys/modifier are possible
on Xvnc, but only two on cygwin/Xfree86.

Yes, this seems to be the case.  I tried it again.  I am having very strange
behavior with the alt key with cygwin/xfree86.  It will work, then it will
just stop working after minimizing the window a few times (in windows, it
creates a single window in windows that, inside, you see the X display).
Then, if I minimize the window a few times, it comes back, very strange.  I
don't know if it is cygwin/X or fvwm2, or a combo.  That is why my original
email asked if anyone had really tried to use it, since I saw some traffic
about compiling it.  The cygwin/X maillist isn't very helpfull, it seems
that there are only two guys that actually answer questions, and everyone
else just asks.  Odd, but I guess that is a sign of a immature product, but
I digress.

Well, after that, the output of xmodmap looks like:
$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Meta_L (0x73)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

But the alt key doesn't move the window with either "1" or "M" now.  I do
notice that the alt key seems to do something (just the left, as expected).
If I move the mouse in the xterm window with the alt key down, it doesn't
move the window, but it does affect how the mouse selection works, it
doesn't hilight anything, so the xterm see that something is going on, it
just looks like fvwm2 doesn't recognize it?

I used xev to see that the keycode send by my alt key is indeed 0x40, so I
think this should be working.

I just came around to playing around with FvwmButtons' "hangon"
feature - it was standard issue back when (ie. the buttons used to
always look pushed-in whenever one pushed 'em a looooong time ago).

I read the man pages, but can't exactly figure how to use it. I get
"/bin/sh: hangon: not found" on stderr whenever I try to insert it
onto my Exec line (in various locations).

I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file

  AddToFunc ToggleNetscape
  +       "I" None (Netscape*) Exec exec netscape
  +       "I" Next (Netscape*) Focus

  # Define the buttons to use.....
  *FvwmButtons Netscape   netscape.xpm   ToggleNetscape

Where do I insert this "hangon" (in between the Exec & exec) to get
the desired affect (please give examples) ???

I'm using fvwm-2.3.33

Thanks

Well, you don't put the word, "hangon" in the Exec command...

I don't believe you can do what you are trying.

Based on the man page, "hangon" works in 3 different contexts,
Swallow, Panel, and Exec.  But thats "Exec" when interpreted by
FvwmButtons, not within a function started by FvwmButtons.

I suppose you could start Netscape  as a slide out  panel,
that would be:

*FvwmButtons (Panel (up) Netscape ToggleNetscape)

WARNING, none of this is tested, and I'm not much of an
FvwmButtons expert.

A configuration option for configurable window placement behavior would be an
acceptable solution. I would be even happier if FVWM2 followed MWMs example,
and made the placement by frame the default, while maintaining the current
placement behavior as a backwards compatibility configuration option.

Whoa, the documentation is lousy.  I had to read it several times
and cross check it with the code to find out what I had to do.
This works:

  *FvwmButtons(Action Exec "xload" xload)

This is not an acceptable solution, because:

  * FvwmButtons subpanel is started together with FvwmButtons and is
    hidden until expanded, probably not what Tim wants
  * The possition of subpanel is fixed, you may resize it, but not move
    (the posision is reevaluated after collapsing/expanding)
  * Netscape is not something one estetically wants to put into panel

Here is a solution that works in the latest 2.3.x:

  Style Netscape GrabFocus
  *FvwmButtons: (Icon netscape.xpm, Action `Exec "netscape" exec netscape`)
                                               # ^^^^^^^^^^ <- "hangon"

And optionally you may write bin/netscape wrapper like the one I use:

#-----------8<-----------cut here-----------8<-----------
#!/bin/tcsh -f
# 
# Start a new netscape program if not already lanched, otherwise add
# a new window (optionally with the specified url) to the existing one.
# Tested with Netscape 3, but should work with Netscape 4 too.
# 
# Usage is like for the original netscape: netscape [url] [other-options]

set NETSCAPE = /usr/bin/netscape
set lock = $HOME/.netscape/lock

set OPTIONS=($*:q)  # preserve all original quotes/spaces
if (-l $lock) then
	# remove any stale lock (useful if netscape crashed)
	if (`ps x | grep '[n]etscape ' | wc -l` <= 1) rm $lock
	if ($#OPTIONS == 0 || $OPTIONS[$#OPTIONS]:q =~ [-,+,0-9]*) set OPTIONS=($OPTIONS:q "")
	@ opt_1 = $#OPTIONS - 1
	# don't add -remote if already specified
	if (-l $lock && "$OPTIONS" !~ *-remote*) set OPTIONS=($OPTIONS[1-$opt_1]:q '-remote' 'openURL('$OPTIONS[$#OPTIONS]:q',new-window);')
endif

$NETSCAPE $OPTIONS:q
#-----------8<-----------cut here-----------8<-----------

Regards,
Mikhael.
