Yes.

Look in your fvwm2 man page, and search for "placement" and "Placement"
to see the various options fvwm2 provides for placement of new windows.
There are many (RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement, various modifiecations
like SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, etc.)

The best choice (in my eyes) is:

  Style * SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

Type "find / -name SysUtil.h" to find out where this file is located
because the build process can't locate it.  If you have a lot of mounted
directories you might try finding in the root subdirectories such as
/usr or /opt.

Let us know where it is then we can perhaps tell you what went wrong in
your configure stage.  I hope you have already mentioned to the list the
system your building on (uname -a) and the version of fvwm you are
building.

  Sorry - I know this is a little OT, but I've scoured the Net to no
avail, and I figure that since fvwm actually does this (in a fashion -
being the WM itself it'll be a bit different).

  I want to set an XPM as an application's icon *within* the application
(i.e., hard-coded), but I don't know how.

  From what I've found out, it looks like I need to create an icon-sized
window, put the XPM's Pixmap in it somehow (as backdrop?), probably using
the Shape X11 extension (how do I know if I've got that? Oh - I've
compiled it into fvwm, so I guess I must have somewhere!), then set the
main window's "icon-window" WM hint to said new window.

  Does that sound about right to anyone? Can anyone flesh out the details?

There's something really fundamentally wrong here.  It looks like your
configure step never worked.

  pp> make
  pp> No suffix list.
  pp>         make  all-recursive
  pp> No suffix list.

"No suffix list."?  Looks like the makefiles are corrupted (or, you're
using a bogus version of make, maybe).

  pp>         gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../../libs
  pp> -DFVWM_MODULEDIR=\"/home/gsm/u08/pushpak/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.2/libexec/fvwm/2.2.2\" -DFVWM_CONFIGDIR=\"/home/gsm/u08/pushpak/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.2/etc\" -DFVWM_CPP='"/lib/cpp"'    -O2 -c FvwmCpp.c

  pp> the SysUtil.h file was

  pp> /usr/contrib/X11R5/include/X11/Xmu/SysUtil.h

If you don't have X installed in the normal place (that is, if
/usr/include/X11 doesn't contain the Xmu/SysUtil.h file somehow, either
directly or by symbolic link) you'll have to use --with-x-includes,
etc. on the configure line to tell it where to find X.

In short, we can't help further until you provide more details:

  * What version of FVWM are you trying to compile?

  * What operating system and version are you building on?

  * What "configure" command line did you use?

  * Did you get any errors during the configure step?

  * What were the results printed at the end of configure?

Etc.

I know Unix; what _kind_ of Unix, and what version?  Solaris 2.5.1?
HP-UX 10.20?  Etc.

  pp> configure --prefix=/home/gsm/u08/pushpak/fvwm/fvwm-2.2.2 --without-cxx

Hmm... this prefix you're using isn't the directory where the source
code is, is it?

The --prefix option is supposed to be where you want to _install_ the
program(s) once their built, not where the source is.  I guess it should
work either way.

---------------

OK, say "ls -l /usr/include/X11".  See if that's a symlink and if so, if
it points somewhere reasonable.  You should be able to say:

  $ ls /usr/include/X11/Xmu/SysUtil.h

and have it list a file, not give an error.

If I may chime in, I think it's worth mentioning that the choice of
"where" to install the compiled code is worth thinking about, since they
can not be moved from there without recompiling...  Therefore, I think a
different directory would be preferable, say without the dash...

Well, FVWM can be moved without recompiling, but the builtin ModulePath
will be wrong so you'll have to reset that in ~/.fvwm2rc.

I guess some of the newer self-config features in 2.3.x may also not
work quite correctly.

But, in general, FVWM is fairly portable.  There do exist some GNU tools
(Emacs and GCC spring immediately to mind) which are a pain in the rear
to move--easier to recompile them.

OK... but what's wrong with the dash?

I stand corrected...  regarding the dash, just a _different_ directory
from the source, but located near by...

I don't like titles on my windows, so I have a:

Style "*"  NoTitle

and it removes them all. I'd like to be able to hit a key (like F2) and
have it toggle the titlebar on the window I've got currently
focused.

Any suggestions on how to do this?

Any way to get the taskbar to possibly use a different color for the titles
if the window is iconified? I know the iconmanager can do this, but I want
the fucntionality of the taskbar that keeps it stretched across the screen
and just shrinks the buttons.

Also, my task bar comes up, and its 8 pixels short of being 1600. Is there
any way to get it to stretch fully across the screen?

I appreciate the fact that fvwm2 does windowshading.... but, as a matter of 
personal taste, I notice the shaded windows look odd ... They seem like they 
are just the title chopped off abruptly.  In some cases, I'd think it might 
look better if it had the appropriate bevel at the bottom edge, giving it a 
'complete' look.

In other thoughts, it might be neat to have an 'include' sort of thing for 
menus.  Ideally, you could put the window list (to make a flwm style menu, or 
one like the GeoWorks express menu) or a submenu into a menu rather than 
making it an offshoot.  Let me try to give an example:
Menu A has items a, b, c
Menu B has items d, e, include menu A, and f, so it displays as d,e,a,b,c,f.

Also, are pinned menus planned?

Knowing the everything-including-the-kitchen-sink featureset of FVWM, those 
options probably exist and I simply don't know where they are. }:-)

is there any option to focus the transients of a window when they popup?

for example.. when I'm using netscape, and i hit meta-f, it will pop up a
little search dialog. is there any option to auto focus that little dialog?

With xdm, its just put in ~/.xsession-errors or /tmp/xses-$USER, or
wherever your xdm is configured to do that (look at the Xsession file in
the xdm dir).

I always thought that if I was a WM developer, I'd be using Xnest to have=
 a
smaller virtual X server inside a window in my normal X server that I could
restart at will without loosing my normal environment. I'm not sure what
has Xnest tho, XFree86 definatly does. I remmeber you doing your
development under AIX (from previous mailing list posts), and I'm not sure
if that exists in their server or even if there is a port of XFree to AIX.

The GrabFocus/GrabFocusTransient styles in the current aplha releases
(2.3.x) do this. With 2.2.x the only way to get this is using
ClickToFocus, but then this will happen with all new windows.

That's because they are indeed chopped off at the bottom :-) Personally
I don't care how this loows, but the bottom border would consume space
unnecessarily. If someone makes a patch, fine, but I don't think one of
the maintainers will take action.

Nice idea, but hard to implement. Perhaps in the release after 2.4, but I
can't make any promises.
 
> Also, are pinned menus planned?

Yes, but it is much more difficult than I expected first (the code isn't
designed to allow easy implementation of pinned menus).

But IconMan can do that too. Try this:

  *FvwmIconMan*ButtonGeometry 1592x24
  *FvwmIconMan*ManagerGeometry 1x1

I don't know what my fellow developers do exactly, but I don't think any of
us uses Xnest for other reasons than debugging. The big problem is that you
can't have the mouse inside the Xnest window and in the debugger window at
the same time. You won't be able to do most interesting stuff with X events
this way. Another thing is that you will have to write a new config file
with different keyboard shortcuts.

That's ancient history. I never hacked fvwm on my AIX. I do all the work
on Linux.

bah!  just a bit too late.. I'll try that out, but i just spent last half
hour messing with FvwmTaskBar and attached along with this mail is a very
small patch to FvwmTaskBar that allows you to specify

*FvwmTaskBarIconFore color

in the config file and it will draw the iconified window names in that
color.

Could this patch be added to the repository?

ok, that sorta works. you can't specify the max button size, and you also
don't get any nice shading if the background color is black.

It's got a few other features, but I'm going to stick with the taskbar for
now.

Also, why did you pick 1592? I'm trying to get my FvwmTaskBar to be 1600
and its not obeying.. it keeps going to 1592 :(

I'd like to have the taskbar keep icons for my iconified windows. The
reason for this is that I like using FvwmAnimate, but I dislike icons.

I'd like FvwmAnimate to be able to do draw its animaions over to the
taskbar. FvwmAnimate does this by getting the iconfiy/deiconfiy event from
fvwm along with the position of the window and the icon.

Any ideas for implementation of this?

Another idea I had was to make FvwmAnimate FvwmTaskBar-aware. But this
would require module-to-module communications, which I don't know is
possible.

Hi.

I've noticed that icons get repositioned when the Recapture command is run. 
Is there any way to turn this off and let the icons stay where they were?

What's happening is that I set FvwmPager to run in iconic mode, in the
location that I like it to be.  This works, but I use a visual theme setup
that requires a recapture every time a theme is set (at least once, at
startup).  This moves the FvwmPager icon to +0+0, where it's usually hidden
under windows.

Please *don't* try making a patch. This is a topic in a standards
discussion between several window manager and desktop environment 
developers right now. Any implementation will probably have to be
rewritten in a few months, so this would be a waste of time.

Because I use a border width of 4 (1600 - 2 * 4 = 1592).

  Could you not do something like:

AddToFunction Add_Menu_A_Contents  \
  AddToMenu $0  "A" Exec a
+ AddToMenu $0  "B" Exec b
+ AddToMenu $0  "C" Exec c

  ... for all menus to be included (for all menus?).


  Then:

Add_Menu_A_Contents "Menu_A"


AddToMenu Menu_B  \
  "D" Exec d
+ "E" Exec e
Add_Menu_A_Contents "Menu_B"
+ "F" Exec f


  I've done something similar to create a slew of near-identical menus,
all differeing by one thing (which is set by the function's parameter).

  That last "F" item might not work without a further AddTomenu.

  I'm sure this'll be in the mailing-list archives somewhere, but here it
is again just in case: I use (with fvwm2+, IIRC):


# FvwmEvent settings

*FvwmEventPassID

*FvwmEventCmd
*FvwmEvent        add_window NewWindowFunc


AddToFunc NewWindowFunc  \
   "I" WindowId $0 (*_popup)       WarpToWindow 50 33
+ any other window-specific stuff for other windows.


  ... and start FvwmEvent at startup. (All Netscape transients have a
class [or name - I don't recall] '*._popup')

Hello,

is there any way to popup a menu or start up a module, if the mouse is
on a
specific position? As example, i wish to open the windowlist, if my
mouse
is on the left side of the desktop.
But i cannot find any option to configure this.
Any hints?


Thanks

When I try that, I get:

FvwmEvent: incomplete event definition *FvwmEventPassID
FvwmEvent: FvwmEventCmd needs a parameter

and then nothing happens.

I'm running fvwm 2.2.2.

  Hmm. I'm running snap 1999-05-21, 2.3.3 - maybe it's new to that. I
don't /recall/ it being a patch. Unless you want to try that snapshot, you
might have to wait till 2.4 comes out.

| I've noticed that icons get repositioned when the Recapture command is run.
| Is there any way to turn this off and let the icons stay where they were?

 I will second this. I suspect that the intended behavior is that icons
that were automatically placed should be re-positioned equally automatically,
perhaps tidying them up. The unfortunate current effect is that if you don't
have automatic icon placement on, all your icons get 'tidied' to +0 +0 in
an ugly mess.

 Ideally, Recapture would only reposition icons that were auto-placed and
then never moved afterwards.

Hi,

This was posted sometime ago, but didn't get a real answer. Is
there a way to specify a fixed size for all the icons, for
example 48x48. All icons would then either keep their size, but
centered into a defined shape, or be cropped to that size. Lots
of icons, i.e. Netscape have transparency in their small icon. I
would suggest something like :

Style "*" IconSize 48 48
Style "*" IconShape SilverBackGround.xpm

That would be far more easier than doing the work manually
on all icons, or creating own icons (I'm so bad at drawing...)

Does that make any sense ?? Am I just dreaming ? :-)

Cheers
Stephane

  IMHO, this [clever auto-scaling of foreign pixmaps] is beyond the call
of duty for a window manager! Maybe as a module, but you'd have to write
it yourself! Far easier to ...

  ... get a hold of ImageMagick, and pass all your app.'s icons through
'convert' to make 'em 48x48, plotted on a non-tranbsparent b.g. Then set
the individual styles buy hand.

  OK, it's an arse, but that's what the configuration stuff's there for!

As I understand it, auto-scaling of the pixmaps was not asked for, only
keeping the icon windows the same size.
This is what MWM does (I hate that about MWM).
Or can it already be done by FvwmIconMan ?

I don't consider tidying up icons a bug. The bug is the 'Recapture' command
itself. It's just a dirty hack to allow already mapped windows to change
their styles (with a positive effect on speed).

Right. auto-scaling an icon to a bigger size usually gives
bad result, due to the resolution. For instance, Adobe Acrobat 4
has by default a very tiny ugly gray icon, but if it could be
centered over a let's say 48x48 colored icon, it would be nice.

I'm getting ImageMagick installed right now... ;-))

>  This is what MWM does (I hate that about MWM).

Why do you hate that ? Do you prefer to have random sized
icons ? Actually 4DWm under SGI Irix does the same, all
icons, wherever they're coming from, are shaped into a
default 78x78 size (ok it's too big but the idea is there,
and the Acrobat icon just looks like others and is perfectly
aligned with others). And no, I don't wanna switch back to
4DWm :-))

| I don't consider tidying up icons a bug.

 I don't consider *genuinely* tidying them up to be a bug. I do think it is
a bug to move them all to +0 +0. (I'm not sure if tidying up an icon that has
been moved since it was placed would be a bug or not; arguably yes and
arguably no.)

 I'll agree that it would be nice if Recapture didn't do anything to
icon positions at all, and there was a separate 'tidy up icons' command.
(Indeed, it shouldn't be too hard to make a global switch for whether
Recapture should ever move icons.)

Oh, well.  Until there is a cleaner way to change styles on the fly, I guess
I'll just comment out the icon-tidying bits in the sources..

doo-dee-doo..  should I make any patches available if I get it working?

I some how got fvwm_2.2.2 version installed on my HP-UX 10.20

Following is my configure command.

  configure --prefix=/home/gsm/u08/pushpak/.fvwm --without-cxx --
--x-includes=/usr/contrib/X11R6/include
                      --x-libraries=/usr/contrib/X11R6/lib

Now I have under
  /home/gsm/u08/pushpak/.fvwm/bin/fvwm2
  ..................................................../libexec/fvwm2
  ..................................................../man/man1/*.1

I have created .Xdefault file under my home dir
it has following two lines.

      *wmStartupCommand: /home/gsm/u08/pushpak/.fvwm/bin/fvwm2
       *waitWmTimeout: 1

when I login in my CDE I am running fvwm2 but the PROBLEM is that
  I get no buttons, my mouse menu works. and when I try to quit from
fvwm2
  it does not quit, I mean it quits fvwm2 but something still running.

Can you please?

thanks

What do you mean, "no buttons"?  By default there is no buttonbar in
FVWM.  If you want one, you'll need to invoke the FvwmButtons module (or
get a 3rd party module like tkgoodstuff) and configure it for the
buttons you want (see the FvwmButtons man page).

  pp> my mouse menu works.

That's good.

  pp> and when I try to quit from fvwm2 it does not quit, I mean it
  pp> quits fvwm2 but something still running.

  pp> Can you please?

See the FVWM FAQ; there's a question there (#2.2) about using FVWM with
CDE.  It says this (among other things):

  > Finally you have to quit with
  >
  >   /usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession (or whatever your path is for dtaction)

  > Now you can happily use cde programs and fvwm.

No, sorry. No such option. It's hard to find a way to make this
feature usable. It interferes with other windows and mage flipping
with the mouse.

The curse of a descriptive subject: there's not really much more to say.
:)

But to phrase it carefully: If I have a pixmap button that I want to fill
the entire allocated button area, how do I do that? I am running fvwm
2.2.2 and my ButtonStyles are Flat. I have MWMBorder and MWMButtons set in
my Style lines and fvwm still insists on placing an unnecessary one or two
pixel relief area around the button (although the button is larger than
the space available; fvwm only provides the "buffer" on the top and left
sides).

Any advice? I know this can be done, I'm just not sure how. Thanks!

I think this will require a patch.  Although tremendously complicated
the ButtonStyle code isn't very flexible yet.

Is it possible to change the position of the geometry window

the display. What about the color?
I did not see any mention about it in the man page. I am using
2.2.2

I want to write a function that finds where my Netscape window is, and
brings it up.  And if there isn't a Netscape window, it'll launch the
program.  This looks like it should work:

    AddToFunc Netscape	"I" Next (Navigator) Iconify -1
    +			"I" Next (Navigator) Raise
    +			"I" Next (Navigator) Focus
    +			"I" None (Navigator) Exec netscape

However, it doesn't.  It launches a new Netscape every time.  The reason
seems to be this line in my config:

    Style "Navigator"	CirculateSkip

I guess the "Next" function skips any windows with this style attribute. 
Indeed, removing this attribute makes the function work correctly.  But
I want that attribute, because I want to Alt-Tab between all my impor-
tant windows, and Netscape isn't important enough.  :)

So what do I do?

Well, the man page says that I can add the "CirculateHit" option, like so:

    AddToFunc Netscape	"I" Next (Navigator,CirculateHit) Iconify -1
    +			"I" Next (Navigator,CirculateHit) Raise
    +			"I" Next (Navigator,CirculateHit) Focus
    +			"I" None (Navigator,CirculateHit) Exec netscape

But it just does the same thing.

What am I doing wrong?

The position can be changed indirectly via the 'Emulate' command:

  Emulate MWM

puts the feedback window in the center of the screen. In the
future this command may do more thigs like presetting styles
or menu styles. But right it has only this effect.

The colours can be changed with the DefaultColors command. These
affect most other colour pairs too (unless you have explicitly
set them).

Hi,
    I was trying to compile fvwm 2.2.2 on Sparc-Solaris platform with
xpm enabled. But I am getting gcc compile errors. Here is an excerpt of

Actually, I accomplished it with the following:

ButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp Pixmap e-buttons/kill_normal.xpm -- Top Right Flat
TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 18 -- Top Left Flat

And similarly for the other buttons. I have no idea what the 'Top'
directives do...but it works!

Hi,

I got a few programs that were running on the default WM
for Irix (4DWm), but are crashing under Fvwm2. One example
is colorview, which shows colors from rgb.txt. I get the
following error :

[afterburner]  ~  (609) % colorview
X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  89 (X_StoreColors)
  Serial number of failed request:  176
  Current serial number in output stream:  183

Sounds like Fvwm2 locks colormap differently than 4Dwm. I am
running 24 bit TrueColor, which makes colormaps readonly anyway,
but I don't know what X_StoreColors is supposed to do.

Is there some freeware that does the same thing ? i.e. browsing
rgb.txt by color name or number and display the color ?

Cheers
Stephane

Well you are using gcc built on a 2.5.1 machine, and my guess is that
you are not building on 2.5.1 if you are on a 2.6 or a 2.7 box you are
going to need to build a compiler for that version of the OS.

Hello,

I'm fairly new at linux, but even newer to fvwm.  I have RH 6 and I don't like
KDE or Gnome which come as default.  I'm trying to set up fvwm2 and I'm 
getting
a little bogged down and I would really appreciate any direction and advice.  

I'd just like to have a basic look to my desktop right now.  I've looked at
countless amounts of screenshots and their .fvwm2rc files and tried to get as
much info on fvwm.  I've very recently subscribed to this newgroup as well.

Is it possible to view the changed settings in the .fvwm2rc file without
exiting out and beginning with startx again?  I don't even have it set up to
boot up to an X-login screen.  If I switch runlevels I go into gdm and then to
gnome, but that's another problem once I get fvwm to look and feel right.  

I realize this message may appear to be broad, and it is supposed.  I'm not
looking for anything to be handed over to me.  I just need a little help
getting in the right direction.  

Thanks very much in advance for any assistance and advice you may be able to
provide.

Yes. Fvwm has a built in 'Restart' command. There have been a lot of changes
to this command recently, so be sure to read the man page that comes with
your distribution. Usually you put the restart command in one of your menus:

  AddToMenu some_menu "Restart fvwm" Restart

Depending on the version you may get sligtly different effects when calling
'Restart'. If you have one of the 2.3.x alpha versions and notice that some
settings you changed in the config file are not reflected in the new fvwm,
try 'Restart --dont-preserve-state'.

The Red Hat setup is a bit tricky. If you run into any trouble with it
please have a look at our FAQ. There is a question/answer about RH setup.

The modules FvwmConsole and FvwmCommand will be invaluable aids when
trying out new config commands. Fvwm accepts virtually all commands
at run time. You can issue all commands with said modules.

FvwmConsole is a shell like terminal window in which you can type your
commands. To start it you use this command:

  Module FvwmConsole

You will probably want to bind it to a menu or your FvwmButtons

  AddToMenu some_menu
  + FvwmConsole Module FvwmConsole

The other module (FvwmCommand) must be invoked once from the config
file. You should invoke the FvwqmCommand server from both, the
InitFunction and the RestartFunction:

  AddToFunc InitFunction Module FvwmCommandS
  AddToFunc RestartFunction Module FvwmCommandS

(modules are killed during a restart, so you have to respawn them).
When the server is in place you can issue fvwm commands from any
shell prompt:

  FvwmCommand 'command 1' 'command 2' ...

(you need to quote the commands if they contain whitespace).

Other commands and modules you might want to have a look at:

Modules:

  FvwmButtons (you'll find my config in the FvwmButtons man page).
  FvwmAnimate (really nice if you like fancy animations)
  FvwmIconMan (very flexible)
  FvwmTaskBar (if you like win95 style)
  FvwmPager (transient pager, viewing current desks)

Styles:

  SloppyFocus
  DecorateTransient 

Commands:

  GlobalOpts (SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, MouseFocusClickRaises)
  SnapAttraction
  SnapGrid

(the list is by no means complete).

If you want to learn some of the neat tricks and fancy features with fvwm
you should have a look at the tips-and-tricks section of the FAQ as well
as the announcement file (where all the new features and hilights are
mentioned). If you have some ideas how things should work but can't figure
them out, just ask. If they can be done you will probably get the answer
on the list and if not they might be useful enhancements.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Try xcolors (graphical) or showrgb (text).

Hi all,

I wonder if you might have a suggestion for me.  I decided to try out
FvwmAnimate to put a little spark on the screen, and as usual ran into a
problem - nothing happens.  I'm a little confused as I have tried both
setting the options directly as well as saving the options to the file
~/.FvwmAnimate.  I wonder, is it possible that there is some other option
set which is nulling out the effects?  Or, am I just doing something
stupid again.  

Thanks,
Tom

Ps. I tried the following to slow things down enough to see 'em, to no
avail.

*FvwmAnimateDelay 1000
*FvwmAnimateIterations 100
*FvwmAnimateTwist 2
*FvwmAnimateWidth 4
*FvwmAnimateEffect Turn
*FvwmAnimateSave

The save, while it should be overkill, was a last ditch effort to see if
things were being set properly...

First make sure you have FvwmAnimate running:

ps -ef | grep FvwmAnimate

should give you a result like this:

xxxx> ps -ef | grep FvwmAnimate
    dane 11613  2075  0 09:33:13 ttyp0    0:00 grep FvwmAnimate
    dane 26666 26660  0   Jul 08 console  0:00 /usr/local/fvwm/2.3.6//FvwmAnimate 9 4 none 0 8

Also note that FvwmAnimate currently only animates desktop icons.
If you are using FvwmTaskbar, FvwmIconMan, or FvwmIconBox and have
"Style * NoIcon" set, you won't see any animation.

I can't predict what putting the "Save" command in the file is going to
do.  (I've never tested it that way.)

Dan,

Thanks!

FvwmAnimate is running.  The save option just tells FvwmAnimate to save
the options to a file in the user's home directory named .FvwmAnimate
which is read by FvwmAnimate when it starts up.  You hit the problem right
on the head, though, with your last comment.  I am slowly modifying the
default "decor" of Fvwm95 on a RH5.2 system.  As such the default is to
have both FvwmTaskbar running and Style * NoIcon!  Commenting out this
style definition corrected the problem. 

Thanks,
Tom

Module  to  module  communications is  very   possible.   (Its done by
sending commands back to  fvwm2 and having  fvwm2 send them out to the
modules that ask for them.

In this   case, you would want FvwmTaskBar   to  see the  "iconify" or
"deiconify" packet without the icon coordinates,  and have it send the
packet back to fvwm2 with the  coordinates.  Fvwm2 would then send the
packet with the co-ordinates  out to all  the modules that  have asked
for these packet types.

After  watching that list  for   a week or   so,  and going thru   the
archives, I disagree.  I don't think theres going  to be any concensus
on that list.  Even if  there is, I don't think  the change from using
the module communications to using X-atoms is all that hard.

I doubt I'll make the changes.  I LIKE icons.

I didn't want to say anything on that list but I do agree with you. The
wm-spec list is taking on all the characteristics of a talking shop (too
many egos, not enough talent 8-)

If anyone is going to do this could they please consider my case of
having icons on screen and having a TaskBar (OK it's FvwmIconMan). I
don't want FvwmAnimate drawing two sets of lines, one to the icon,
another to the TaskBar.

Cheers,
Tim.

Don't underestimate the power of laziness. In the end the document
will very much look like Matthias Ettrich's first draft if there is
no real consensus. Gnome/KDE will probably adopt that 'standard' even
without it. The whole thing may fail because nobody is willing and has
the time to make a sound draft that is not focused entirely on technical
aspects.

I downloaded and extracted the tar for 2.2.2. When I attempt to run
./configure, it runs for a few lines but stops and gives the following
error:

"no acceptable cc found in $PATH"

I am using RedHat 5.2 with the 2.0 Kernel. XFree86 3.3.3.1 is installed

Thanks and regards,

Hi all,

I seem to be getting real confused lately.

I'm trying to run xscreensaver when I log in by doing something like 

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+ "I" Exec exec xscreensaver -timeout 1 
+ "I" Wait *screensaver

But after loging in I find that it is not running.  I've tried various
combinations of using Wait and not, using just Exec and using the
combination Exec exec, all to no avail.  Strangely though, It can be run
from the menu options.  Looking at the .fvwm2rc file I find that the menu
option is doing something like this:

# The following is added by package: xscreensaver
AddToMenu       AUTO_WM_CONFIG.Amusements.Screen_Savers "xscreensaver
(1min time out)"   Exec    xscreensaver -timeout 1 -cycle 1 &

I should mention that I am using a RedHat system.  I could use the & also,
but the man page for fvwm2 says NOT to do so.  Can someone please tell me
_why_ we should not use an & like done above?

Thanks Much,
Tom

I'm not sure; seems weird.

Do you have a log file you can look at to see if xscreensaver is giving
any errors?  I don't know that much about RedHat's setup, so I can't
tell you exactly where to look.

  tag> I should mention that I am using a RedHat system.  I could use

The Exec function starts a subshell with the -c option to run your
command, then it abandons it.  Thus, the "&" is redundant since the
entire shell is already, in effect, in the background.

Exec _doesn't_ wait for the shell to exit, so there's no benefit to
using an "&".

Even more, what does "exec foo &" really mean?  Exec replaces the
current shell's runtime image with "foo", instead of invoking foo as a
subprocess.  But the "&" is supposed to execute "exec foo" in a
shubshell in the background...

No. Fvwm can't do it and I doubt any other window manager can.

(This is not intended as an off-topic promo, just adding some info to
the thread)

Rumor is that the E window manager will in the future, not that they
have a lock on the market, with XFree86 4.0 and using a new extension
called xinerama. See http://www.linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=121
a little over half way down.

You don't really think that the E people have a lock on the multiheaded
X display
market do you? And you don't think they have a patent on xinerama do
you?

Ummm, FVWM runs fine on an Xinerama multiheaded server.  So does every
other window manager.  Why?  Because Xinerama presents a single large
bitmap to the application.  Nothing even needs to know about its existence.

Now, it is nice to have special support for, say, not popping up windows
and menus half on one head and half on the other  Eventually FVWM will get
this, but Xinerama is underdocumented at the moment and I haven't had much
luck finding out how to determine where the "seams" are.

If everyone is wondering why they don't have Xinerama, it's part of XFree
4.0 (and indeed should be a general X11R6.4 thing).  You have to be an
XFree developer to get at the development sources.

I just installed redhat linux with which they gave me fvwm2.  I am trying to
customize fvwm, but the system.fvwmrsc file in the fvwm folder does not match
the set up that I have.  Has anyone used redhat's config of fvwm?
where do they hide the resource files for the windows managers?

What you want to look at is /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/
In there you will find a number of m4 included files which are used to
build up a .fvwm2rc file every time you log in.  If you wish to modify a
few things you should start by looking at fvwm2rc.defines.m4. Depending on
what you see when you log in, xdm, gdm, ...  I believe that the script
which actually executes the command fvwmm4 is 

/usr/bin/X11/RunWM

The command is essentially 

exec fvwm2 FvwmM4 -debug (the .rc file)

which will put a copy of the M4 generated .fvwm2rc file in your tmp
directory.  The .rc file in this case is either 

/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4

or $HOME/.fvwm2rc.m4 if this (above) file is copied to your home directory
and renamed to .fvwm2rc.m4

If you choose to put the file .fvwm2rc.m4 in your home directory then at
that point you have complete control over what follows and can create your
own AnotherLevel directory if you should desire with different decors,
etc.

Hope I answered your question,

Tom

That sound as if you have no C conpiler installed (e.g. gcc).
Can you compile anything else?

Hi,

Previously I wrote...

> I'm trying to run xscreensaver when I log in by doing something like 
> 
> AddToFunc "InitFunction"
> + "I" Exec exec xscreensaver -timeout 1 
> + "I" Wait *screensaver

and a few people replied to me for which I am very gratefull.  I managed
to find the source of the problem, though I can't say _why_ it caused the
problem it did.  What I was in fact doing was a little different from what
I showed above.  This

AddToFunc "InitFunction" 
+ "I" Exec exec xemacs
+ "I" Wait xemacs
+ "I" Exec exec xscreensaver -timeout 1

does not work.  This

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+ "I" Exec exec xemacs
+ "I" Wait *emacs
+ "I" Exec exec xscreensaver -timeout 1

does work.  It also works if the Wait is taken out completely.  I tried
this because the title on the xemacs window I saw open (when I was editing
this file) was emacs instead of xemacs.  What I do not understand is why
the (incorrect) Wait statement gave this odd behavior of not executing the
following statement.  In fact it may have never finnished; I don't know.
Does Wait ever time out?

I guess we can chalk this one up to poor programming and faulty question
posting.

Thanks All,

Tom

I decided to change around some of my X startup stuff, and found a
strange behavior of fvwm2.

Previously I would start all my clients from my .xsession script, and
then exec fvwm2 at the bottom.  Now my script basically just exec's
fvwm2, and I've moved my clients' startup to the InitFunction, like so:

    AddToFunc InitFunction
    +       "I" Exec xload
    +       "I" Exec oclock
    +       "I" Exec xcb
    +       "I" Exec netscape -iconic
    +       "I" Function StandardXterms
    +       "I" Exec ICQ

Strangely, though, when I start up my X session now, I am treated to a
completely blank X screen, and it will stay that way, indefinitely,
until I touch the mouse, moving it slightly.  Then the window manager
"wakes up" and runs its InitFunction.

Why does it do this?

That's hard to say unless you tell us the fvwm version you are using.
This should not happen.

Sorry, fvwm 2.2.2.  Linux 2.2, libc5, XFree 3.3.2.

I agree.

I've seen it also on my Linux box at work, which is stock RedHat 6.0,
fvwm 2.2.

This is the kind of error that results from fvwm2 having a key binding
overriding that expected by the application.  I had this problem with a
Raise/Lower binding to a Ctrl-<something> from a default fvwmrc setup
(from fvwm version 1 days).  When the app tries to start up, it apparently
tries to register with the X server for its expected special keys.  It
dies when it cannot get direct access to the key it wants.  Check out all
of the hotkeys your app uses and find out which is already in use by
fvwm2.  Alternately (what I really did), delete all key bindings other
than root window bindings and successively add them back to find which
causes the problem.  The app will have to be restarted after eacy key
assignment, or at least have a new window popped up which expects the key
to be available.  

There should be appropriate key assignment references to this problem in
the mailing list archive.  I don't recall seeing anyone else suffer this
problem (or complain publicly about it), so it is possible you could find
them all by searching on my name in the archive.

  I'm trying to get my current buttons on top of a pixmap (used to use
gradient). However, the buttons insist on having the title background, not
the pixmap I've put onto the title.

  The only apparent way of doing this (looking at a couple of themes) is
to set the buttons to all started with TiledPixmap as well ... but this
resets the tiling for each button (natch).

  Am I missing somthing? I'm (now) using the latest snap FWIW, but this
was true on 2.2.2 earlier today.

...

  Is it the UseTitleStyle? Do I want something else?

To stack the styles you can use 'AddButtonStyle'. After setting the
pixmap background you should add the vector with

  AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 11 ...

Dos this solve your problem?

  No :(  I'd (up until this point) actually /had/ AddButtonStyle, but now
with:

+  ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle
+  AddButtonStyle 1  Default
   # 2 stacked rectangular panels like stills of a window being maximized
+  AddButtonStyle 2  \
      Vector 11  \
         95x10@0 95x75@0 25x75@0 65x75@0 65x90@0 10x90@0  \
         10x55@1 25x55@1 25x75@1 25x10@1 95x10@1
...

  I get what I had before that made me use  ButtonStyle: all my buttons,
although transparent as far as being able to see the title's XPM is
concerned, still have the default vector box underneath *my* vectors
(presumably due to a lack of 'ButtonStyle' commands overrideing it). The
first line above that I put in to cover that doesn't.

hi,
i am very new in configuring Fvwm2 and i have a problem. i want to
have a small pixmap (20x62 pixel) on the left side of the
button-bar. the button should contain only this picture and no space
on the side left and right of this pixmap. but this button has the
same size like other "real" buttons with a normal pixmap.

my pixmap has a size like this:
 __

|  |

Hi,

I have been trying to get icons to work with my 
fvwm , i installed xpm ,cxpm etc but these
are in a bin directory in my home directory, 
I also downloaded a whole set of icons in xpm
format so that i could set them for the different applications
but nothing seems to work,i keep getting the  default
icons.

Any help on this would be of great help.

Thanks

Krishna

  I understand that fvwm's probably loading XPMs with a degree of lenience
for the colours within the pixmap (as the Xpm library allows) - I'll check
the code in detail in a mo., but in the meantime:

  Im trying to texture-up my display ('cos I can!). I'm limited to 256
cols., so I'm ImageMagicking the pixmaps that I want to use into 8-16
colours, and editing these so that they all use the same small subset of
shades of blue that I prefer. I.e., with all the pixmaps loaded, I still
shouldn't lose more that 16 colours out of my Colourmap


  a) I defined some title-bar button pixmaps (to try to get around the
problem of not being able to have transparent-through-to-the-titlebar
buttons - it still doesn't work, BTW), and found am oddity such that, with
a 4-colour button (transparent, main, and high & low-lights for 3D), the
pixmap's actually plotted with different colours to the ones I have on the
xpm file ... even though the 'main' colour is the same as the title-bar's
background colour.

     Thus, I get, where the pixmap's transparent, the correct 'main'
colour (since it's the background), but where the pixmap has that very
colour in it's definition, I get a distortion of it - like it's failed to
find the real one & picked the nearest).


  b) I've set an 8-colour pixmap to be my menu backdrop. This pixmap works
perfectly well elsewhere, but on the menu, it only ever appears with two
colours, as if it's been dropped to a 1-bit visual.


  Anyone any clues?


  Ref: Sparc/Solaris 2.5.1; fvwm 2.3.6 (snap 19990716). I don't believe
that the problem's restricted to this beta version, though.

  According to the man page, it *looks* like MWMDecorMaximize, along with
the ToggleActiveUp/Down states for buttons, should allow for a button that
changes definition according to it's window's maximised state.

  But doing:

AddButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMaximize

  ... similar to the example in the man page for MWMDecorShade, is thrown
out by fvwm. The single '-' looks a bit dubious to me.


  Even if I get this in, is it actually going to do what I think?

  Ah-har.

  OK. For my purposes, then, I may have to compile fvwm up with a custom
hotlist of primary colours.

  Thanks.

Not neccesarily.  Since you are being very careful about the colours you
use you could set ColorLimit to 0 to disable it.

Cheers,

  Yeah, I guess since it only applies to XPMs imported directly by FVWM
(e.g., the coloured icon built into netscape wouldn't count, since it
creates the Pixmap).

  I'm running unlimited ATM to check it's all still OK - I'll see how I go
:-)


  [of course, now my "finely tuned" window title/button XPMs have reverted
to the colours they *really* are,. instead of the FVWM-near-hits that they
looked nice with, I've got to edit their colours all over again!]

When trying to unsubscribe I get the following -

The original message was received at Wed, 21 Jul 1999 10:23:27 +0100

Having looked at the page mentioned above it appears to be the case that it
rejects on the grounds that I use a dynamic IP which DSSL has chosen to 
black list - Spam may be objectionable but so is a mailing list one is 
unable to unsubscribe from. Since most home users probably use Dynamic IPs
and are at risk from this arbitrary judgement this strikes me as downright
ludicrous.  (Come to that I don't suppose people can subscribe either ...)
Assuming this spam filter doesn't reject this message as well, please
unsubscribe me  I don't want to pay to download any more fvwm messages.

Your provider has a mail server.  You must configure your machine to use
it.  Pretty simple, really.  Failure to do this will result in you not
being able to send to a heck of a lot more hosts than just mine.

I have removed you from the list.

  I'd like to attach a function to a menu-click on a window's title bar
that does something different according to the window.

  Now, I think that 'CurrentWindow (WindowIWant) DoIt' in the function
attached with 'Mouse' will do the trick by virtue of the fact that by the
time the click's processed, said window will have the focus and thus be
'Current'.

  Am I right, firstly? Is 'CurrentWindow' /actually/ the focus window? If
this won't work, is there another way of identifying the window upon which
the action occured?

  I'm aware that, e.g., Iconise (with no params.) works in this context,
correctly identifying the window that the click occured upon, but is this
again simply due to the clicked window becoming 'Current' by getting the
focus?

  Actually, I think what I want is 'WindowId $w (WindowIWant) Doit'. Maybe
I should've figured that out earlier, since I was the one who added
'(condition)' to WindowId :-/

  I'm trying to get an 'iconise-all' button onto certain windows (e.g.,
"Navigator"). It's farily simple to do this by having a generic Decor, and
having a second identical one that's got an extra button, then using that
decor on the relevant windows.

  But is there a way of specifying for, say, button 6, a different
function for a different style? E.g.,

    Style "Navigator" Mouse 0 6 A  All (Navigator) Iconify On
    Style "XTerm"     Mouse 0 6 A  All (XTerm)     Iconify On

  ... would do it if Mouse were a style. I can't call a function upon the
click and have /it/ sort it out, since the function would only have the
window's ID, not its class.

  If there's no way around this, a possible solution would be a '$c'
addition to the '$w', '$d', etc.  that functions already have. I guess
'$n' would be good there too (window name).

It may look suspicious, but it works. I use this line:
 
  ButtonStyle 6    - MWMDecormaximize

or

  ButtonStyle 6    - MWMDecorShade

I don't know. What *do* you think. It causes the vector to be drawn
inverted when the window is maximized.

I'm not quite sure if you are aware that fvwm95 and fvwm (aka fvwm2)
are different window managers. No development has been going on on
fvwm95 for about two years now, so plain fvwm is probably what you
want.  If you feel uncomfortable with the red hat setup you can
fetch a copy of the latest stable release from our home page:

  http://fvwm.org

If you compile and install this package you will get a standard
installation in the standard location (/usr/loca/...). Be warned
that the deafult configuration isn't very nice yet (in fact it's
quite ugly).  There is a section about RH setup in the docs/FAQ file
in the distribution.

  fvwm2.3.6/snap19990716:


+ "I" AddToDecor $0  AddButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMaximize

>> [FVWM][ReadButtonFace]: <<ERROR>> unknown style -: - MWMDecormaximize

  or

  Hmm. Let me try just ButtonStyle ... Ah-ha! It likes that now. So why
only ButtonStyle, and what's with the "-" syntax?


  But I still can't make it do what I think it ought to:

  Well, I've got:

+ "I" AddToDecor $0  AddButtonStyle 1  Pixmap FNX-window-control.xpm
+ "I" AddToDecor $0  AddButtonStyle 2  \
         Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm  \
         ToggledActiveUp    (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ToggledActiveDown  (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm)
+ "I" AddToDecor $0  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMaximize

   with:

Mouse 0 2       A       Maximize-Func


  I'd expect ...-on.xpm normally, then ...-off.xpm if maximised. No? I
actully get the ...-on.xpm all the time. I used to do this with a line in
Maximise-Func that did a different UseDecor according to whether the
window was currently already maximised or not, meaning keeping two
identical decors, with one button diff. between them. I thought this would
do the same thing in a neater fashion.

I'm not sure why you bothered to do this, but...

How?  Did you install an rpm you downloaded from some site or did you
build fvwm2 version 2.2 taken from the fvwm site?

To keep the same functionality that was set up in the original system
you might want to take a look at the system default Xclients file

/etc/X11/xinit/Xclients

which sources /usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM

Is the executable fvwm2 that you wish to run come early in your path, i.e.
before any other verions?

Sure.  Do you want to install the latest version of fvwm2 rpm that you can
find or do you want to build and install fvwm2 yourself?

Dominik, I'm not sure I know what you mean by this statement.  In the
RedHat setup, the stript /usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM executes the statement

eval "exec fvwm${FVWMVER} ${FVWMOPTIONS}" > "$HOME"/.FVWM${FVWMVER}-errors
2>&1

where FVWMVER is either fvwm2, fvwm95 or fvwm95-2 with precedence in that
order.

and by default FVWMOPTIONS is 

"-cmd 'FvwmM4 -debug /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4"

In fact in this file you will even find statements like:

    echo "RESUMING with Fvwm2 (95 look)" >&2
    Start_Fvwm95

For all I can tell, fvwm95 is fvwm2 with the decors set up for the "95
look".  It's not my preferred decor, but...

Dominik is probably assuming  the  same thing  I  would.  There was  a
split-off from  fvwm2 called fvwm95.  If  RedHat is calling fvwm2 with
W95 decor "fvwm95", I wish they would reconsider.

I'm sorry, I don't understand the problem.
What version of fvwm2 are you using?

What OS are you running?

Show us some of the configuration commands you used.

I know what the xpm library is, but I don't know what "cxpm" is.

Hello,

I've been working on a stripped down window manager starting with lwm.
I've been trying to add and subtract features to suit what I'm trying to
end up with.  One of the things I'm trying to do is implement a
ClickToFocus behavior.

The reason I'm writing to this list is because I've been looking through
the fvwm2 source and have noticed ClickToFocus has been implemented as a
style and that it is checked in lots of places.  In trying to understand
how the focus events work I disable my NotifyEnter handler and this
keeps the focus from switching when the mouse is over the frame and
keeps the window from becoming active(raised?) when the mouse is over
the frame (because that code is in the NotifyEnter handler) but the
focus still switches when the mouse moves over the client.  Is their
some other message that is causing Focus change notification?  I tried
to include a FocusIn handler which did nothing but return but don't know
if you have to add some setting to make sure you receive that message.

System info; using a PII 333 with 64M and a 3GB drive, I've installed
Red Hat 6.0 full install.

What you could do instead is have Decor "Foo" contain a Button 6, and then
have the appropriate NoButton statements in your Style
definition. Admittedly, this doesn't solve the larger problem of changing
the function for each window. Your suggestion for extra variables in the
function definition does sound nice, though.

try this: 
1) comment out everything in your ~/.Xclients so all it reads is:

exec fvwm2

2) make sure fvwm2 is installed and in your path. to find out where it's
installed do this command: find / -name fvwm2

3) you could try uninstalling AnotherLevel, if you dont like it.( I
believe this is redhats fvwm95 program your talking about)

4) make sure you have a .fvwm2rc in your hom dir, you can get get sample
ones in the fvwm2 distribution.
it should then work, if I doesnt try putting the full path to fvwm2 in
your .Xclients

Good luck,
sa

News from www.xfree86.org:

The first pre-4.0 XFree86 snapshot is now available

     [July 1999] 

     The first pre-4.0 XFree86 snapshot is now available. It is labeled
as version 3.9.15. 
     See our snapshots page for further details. These snapshot releases
are work-in-progress 
     snapshots of the XFree86 4.0 development code. If you're looking
for a stable version of 
     XFree86, you will be better off with the latest 3.3.x release in
most cases.

  That's largely what I've got ATM. Currently, I have to have a function
CreateStandardDecor that takes $0 = decor name & creates a decor called
<$0> with all my fav. stuff in. Then, :

    CreateStandardDecor "DefaultDecor"

    CreateStandardDecor "IconiseAllDecor"
    AddToDecor IconiseAllDecor  \
       AddButtonStyle 6  Pixmap FNX-window-iconise-all.xpm


  As for the function extra variables. Hmm. I can feel a patch coming on.
If this is a fairly noddy affair (as I suspect it ought to be, but I've
not even glanced at that section of code yet), are enough people
interested for me to do it 'properly' and ask to get it put in? That's
assuming I can do, of course!



  Which kind of leads to an unrelated thing I was wondering about: does
anyone know roughly what the proportion of users of FVWM to actual readers
of this list is? (IYSWIM)

  Running fvwm2.3.6/snap-19990716 (IIRC), I've now got the following
'functionality': I run FvwmPager with 3x2 pages, and keep my Netscape
Navigator windows together on page 1 0. My main stuff, inc. MailThread I
keep in 0 0.

  If I'm on a page other than 0 0 & mail turns up, when NS turns the mail
icon into the 'you-ve mail' pixmap, the icon migrates to the current page
- but when I <Meta-M> [defined to warp to the mailthread window's page &
open that window], fvwm takes me back to page 0 0, and the window
deiconises into 0 0.

  Admittedly, I don't force MailThread into page 0 0, although I suppose I
could (since compose windows have a diff. class, so I could still reply to
Web mailto:s without changing from page 0 1).

  Is this 'relocate icon on change' intended new functionality, or a bug
in this snap?

I apologize for repeating this message but I realized that I hadn't
included my email address and didn't want to force anyone to reply to
the list just to answer one of my questions.

I'm trying to work with a small window manager and customize it's
behavior.  I'm working with lwm as a starting place.  One issue I've
been struggling with is how to keep focus from following the mouse.  The
place where it's being handled now is in the EnterNotify handler and
when I make that handler return, to keep the code from switch the focus
of the windows, when the mouse makes it over the client inside the
frame, the input focus still switches.  Is there some other message that
changes the focus?  I tried adding FocusIn and FocusOut handlers but I
must not be registering properly for those events because my handlers
don't get called.

I've been trying to look in the code of fvwm2 but since it is a style it
hasn't seemed really clear how ClickToFocus works.
System info; using a PII 333 with 64M and a 3GB drive, I've installed
Red Hat 6.0 full install.

Any suggestions?

Wouldn't it take up less space (potentially) to have one global decor and
then add NoButton 6 or Button 6 on the appropriate Style statements?

As to people reading vs. people using FVWM, I use it. :)

I have a function in my .fvwmrc that looks like this:

AddToFunc "GotoDeskPage"
+ "I" GotoPage $1 $2
+ "I" Desk 0 $0

I also have a large, semi-complicated m4 function that spits out
keybindings for switching to any page on any of my virtual desktops.

The problem is that it doesn't work. The keybindings that come out of the
m4 function look like this:

Key F1 A 4 GotoDeskPage 0 0 0
Key F1 A 5 GotoDeskPage 0 1 0

and so on, for each one of the function keys. The second keybinding always
works. The first one, however, does not. I think this is a problem with
FVWM not recognizing the `4' modifier, because if the keybindings are
generated like so:

Key F1 A 3 GotoDeskPage 0 0 0
Key F1 A 5 GotoDeskPage 0 1 0

everything works fine. Any suggestions as to what might be causing this
behavior and how I can get my `4' modifier to work properly? I'm using
Redhat 5.1 with XFree86 3.3.1 and FVWM 2.2.2.

  Yup - but I discovered that stype option after I'd written the reply :)


  'Cept when I come to add an alternative button 6 to another style! Not
that I can think of a reason why I would, yet.

I have a similar problem as Kelly stated about ClickToFocus too. I am
working on a special WM project and which based from fvwm. I want this
WM only have ClickToFocus active and want to change focus whatever user
click (any combination of keystroke with mouse button click) to any of
window (which include title bar, button, border, application widget,
... etc.).

I have been updated my source based on the archive Mar 24, 1999 which
Dominik Vogt suggest. I have modified the file event.c in the function
HandleButtonPress() and comment out the line to check for modifier key.
But I still can not make to above requirement work.

For example, I have two xterm (let's call them xtermA and xtermB)
running. First, xtermA have the focus. Then, press shift plus first
mouse button click on xtermB (try not on border and title bar). The
xtermB won't get the focus on the action. And then, try just first
mouse button click to xtermB again. This time the xtermB have the
focus. Would anyone explain how the ClickToFocus work in fvwm in
detail? What will be the event flow from X server to a window itself to
make it focus?

Many thanks in advance!!

Hi, 

Was wondering if there was anyway to make a dual monitor
system behave as a single workspace.

Currently the two monitors behave like 2 different workspaces.
So now I can't drag a window across from one monitor to the other,
also there are 2 instances of workspaces for both etc.

Thanks for any help with this.

I'm not quite sure what you are trying to do. ClickToFocus has nothing
to do with FocusIn/Out events in the first place. The window manager itself
causes these events by switching the focus from one window to another
(by calling XSetInputFocus). Some rare applications do this themself.

Yup, it's rather confusing. ToggledActiveUp/Down refers to a button
on the active window that if 'up' (i.e. not pressed with a mouse button)
or 'down' (i.e. pressed with mouse button held). I don't think what you
want is possible right now. I'd love to throw away the ButtonStyle,
BorderStyle and TitleStyle syntax completely and rewrite it from scratch.
It's *horrible* and even the most expert fvwm cracks are unable to
make it work.

None. The window itself doesn't deal with the keyboard focus.
(Usually - it *may* request to receive the FocusIn and FocusOut
events, to do something itself). If the window has the keyboard
focus X sends keyboard events to its application (if requested),
if it doesn't have the focus it doesn't send them.

What are you trying to do in events.c? There is no check for
the pressed modifier key in the relevant part of the code:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
void HandleButtonPress(void)
{
  int LocalContext;
  char *action;
  Window OldPressedW;

  DBUG("HandleButtonPress","Routine Entered");

  /* click to focus stuff goes here */
  if((Tmp_win)&&(HAS_CLICK_FOCUS(Tmp_win))&&(Tmp_win != Scr.Ungrabbed))
  {
    SetFocus(Tmp_win->w,Tmp_win,1);    <---- !!!
    ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'SetFocus' function handles focus switching. This works regardless
of the modifier keys held.

Dominik,

Thanks for the reply.  It turns out that I did figure out that the
FocusIn and FocusOut messages weren't causing my problem.  The behavior
I'm trying to clear up is why I can get the input focus into an xterm
(for example) without my windowmanager explicitly giving it the focus.
I changed the NotifyEnter event handler to return without doing anything
which causes no window to be able to become active.  I thought that this
would keep the focus from being able to be switched but I was wrong.
Having to inactive but visible xterm windows up, the focus follows the
mouse but only when the mouse is over the xterm client, not the frame.
I was wondering how to keep that from happening.  I think my problem is
that no window had the focus so some default behavior was interfering
with what I was trying to do.  I noticed in some other window managers,
FVWM2 I think was one of them, keep a window around that is invisible
just to store the focus and my theory is that I need to do the same
thing.

Leo, I'm not sure what exactly you are trying to do, but using fvwm95,
don't you find under start/preferences/Xresources the basic options of
loading/ merging/ .Xdefaults and .Xresources and show the current
settings?  I assume that this is a RedHat system from the name you give
for Fvwm2.  If this does not help, please clarify...

This is the fvwm/fvwm2 mailing list.  If by "fvwm95" you mean fvwm2
with config files that make it look like "w95", then read on, or at
least take these answers as answers you would get if you were using
fvwm2.

fvwm2 itself doesn't read or change x-resources.

The resource database is read or displayed by the xrdb command.
Try "man xrdb" for starters.

Greetings from a new user!

I've been a WindowMaker/Enlightenment user for a couple of years, but
some trouble came up with desktop management in a program I need for my
research, so I had to join the fvwm club.

Some things about fvwm2 are quite befuddling and I think you could save
new users trouble.  I may have missed something obvious, but I can't
find anywhere in your documentation or faq a simple explanation of how
users are supposed to create desktops and navigate them.  Just about
every other windowmanager comes with preconfigured key combinations to
change desktops.  It is hard to understand why fvwm2 makes it so
mysterious when so many other options are written out in such detail.  

Anyway, I set out to make fvwm2 behave as much like WindowMaker as
possible, and in doing that I discovered the true beauty of fvwm2.  Many
many features can be customized.  I found editing the .fvwm2rc file to
be somewhat troublesome because of the problem of "ordering" as commands
override each other.  Still, most of that resolves itself with some
patience. The man page is really quite excellent and I compliment the
authors.

I think I've gone about as far as I can go in fiddling the .fvwm2rc file
and the immitation-WM functionality is not bad.  I've got the staples of
the WindowMaker style interface, including:

   Alt-number to switch to desktop number
   Alt-tab    to cycle (and circulateRaise applications)
   Alt-left click anywhere in a window to move it.
   Alt-right click anywhere to resize
   left Double click title bar to shade
   right click title bar to show window ops menu.

I've got buttons with pixmaps I ripped from the Enlightenment ShinyMetal
theme.  I've gotten rid of the motif style as much as possible.

The Wharf can do most of the "look" of the WM dock, but has none of the
feel and ease of configurability. Too bad.

I took a screenshot and put it here:
http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/FVWM2likeWM.jpg
And my .fvwm2rc is here
http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/WindowMaker/fvwm2rc

There are some things I cannot figure out, perhaps somebody in this list
can help me.

Question 1.  Can fvwm2 be compiled to support png or tiff format
pixmaps?

Question 2. I figured how to tile pixmaps in the title bar, but I can't
figure how to scale them. Is it not possible?

Question 3.  Is it possible to make the side handles have width 0 but
have the bottom resize bar have with 5?

Question 4.  I would like to do something pretty with the root menu.  I
was trying to put a pixmap on the background for each menu item, as in
WindowMaker or Enlightenment. But I couldn't make it work.  Possible?

Question 5.  I had an entirely unhappy experience with FvwmIconBox. 
With gnome running, it is filled up with grey squares which, I think,
represent the gmc icons on the desktop.  Can someone give me a few
pointers on what this module is supposed to do? I imagined it would be
like the icon box in Enlightenment, which is empty until you minimize
something, and then it shows in the box.
