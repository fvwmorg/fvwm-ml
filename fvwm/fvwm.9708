hi,

i have many problems with '-geometry' :(

i start a program with geometry XxX+X-X in my desktop Nr.8 from desk 1
=>
it works.. but when i try to start it with the same geometry-params from
desk2
then it didn't work :-(
sample:

FvwmButtons 
.fvwm2rc 

AddToFunc fvwm2b_inet
+       "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+       "I" Module FvwmButtons File /root/.fvwm2b_inet
         
AddToFunc fvwm2b_nrm
+       "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+       "I" Module FvwmButtons File /root/.fvwm2b_nrm

*FvwmButtonsFile /root/.fvwm2b_nrm

.fvwm2b_nrm =>
Geometry 805x57+0-0

when i start FvwmButtons => no problems..
but when i start the Function =>

Hi, 
I'm running fvwm2-95 (v.2.043a, the same problem is also present
in fvwm1.24) under XFree3.2 and Linux 2.0.30

fvwm always freezes ( it really freezes, Ctrl-alt-bckspace doesn't
help, and switching to other virtual consoles doesn't work, so I have to
reset the computer)under the following circumstances

If I open a ppp connection, run a program on a remote
host which sends its window to my desktop, and then, without
quitting the remotely executed program, close the connection,
the remote program's window doesn't disappear, instead, any
attempt to "touch" this window (eg click on it, click on the title,
iconify, deiconify, delete, etc) causes fvwm to freeze...

The problem doesn't exist under twm, so it is probably bug
in fvwm, not in X server itself.....

Thanks for your time and attention

This is a really nice site :) I have to say that you've put together a
comprehensive set of configurations, once again, congrats :) However, I
have one suggestion... Can you specify that the last two config's (mine)
are actually scripts that should be run to build and install all the
necessary fvwm rc's and pixmaps... 

I'm saying this because people have asked me before to just show them the
rc files so they can see how I did stuff....

Otherwise, a beautiful site. :)

A while ago Redhat ran a competition for the best desktop using FVWM and

hi,

I would like to know if someone has been able to use other keys as
a meta key.  I have the current problem that I have more than one
key which I would gladly use as a metakey instead of the default key.

I am using fvwm-2.0.45. under Ultrix 4.3.

Is this possible without altering the source code?

Thanks for your help

EJ

Cool page.

Another suggestion: part the coolness with fvwm is the modules. And much of
the newbie problems I've seen comes from not know about some modules (like
FvwmPager) or not being able to understand everything that the module offers
(FvwmButtons or FvwmIconMan or FvwmM4 or ...). I think it would 
be cool if you could list for each config which modules it uses.

If you get enough config files, then it might be useful to even have the rc's
cross referenced by which fvwm features they use (clicktofocus, icons, xpm's,
gradients, funky M4 commands, etc). 

Once you have such a list, then the thing to do is solicit rc's which fill in
gaps. You should have at least one rc for every module and major fvwm
feature.

You can use xmodmap to tell any key to be Meta_L or Meta_R.  But you
can't have more than one Meta_L key, likewise for Meta_R.

You can tell Fvwm to use other modifiers than Ctrl, Shift, Meta: use 1
to mean mod1, 2 for mod2 and so on.  Type xmodmap -pk to see which
modifiers are active and what keys they have.

You can use xmodmap to tell any to that it's got the Meta modifier:

    xmodmap -e "add mod1 = Caps_Lock"

(Not that this example makes sense.)

Hi,

Sorry if this is redundent or just plain stupid.  I have read the FAQ  
and the man pages and looked at a good number of .fvwm2rc's plus as
many Web sites to no avail.

I've just built and installed fvwm (2.0.45) on a number of Dec Unix
boxes but I can't figure out how to get the mouse to act as a left
handed mouse as it does under Motif or CDE.  I can get the window
managers built-ins to reverse the order of the keys (for window manger
activities) but it doesn't translate to applications (netscape, xemacs,
cut 'n paste etc...)  

I'm sure it's something simple but I'm just too aggravated now to see
it.  

Any help would be most appreciated.  Also, please send directly to me
as my subscription  to the mailing list is fouled up. (between email
addresses)

Thanks,

JJ

Hi Again,

Figures, soon as I mail the list (first time) to announce my
ignorance, I find the solution.

Adding xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1" to the InitFunction in .fvwm2rc
gave me the desired effect.

Sorry for the noise.

Thanks,

JJ

<smack on the head> Right, that figures. I have an LK401 keyboard
which has 4 keys which can quite well be defined as Meta keys. I was
stunned by this effect however, because Fvwm cannot deal with multiple
Meta_L bindings, but Emacs can!

Depends, who needs a Caps Lock :)

Ok, I downloaded the lasted version of FVWM2 and did the following after
I untar/gziped it.

MakeMakefiles
make install; make install.man

It made all of the object modules (*.o) but never linked them. I can`t
find the executable anywhere. Anybody have any answers?

Is there a simple way to install fvwm 2.0.45 I have no understanding of
make and compilers, following the instructions in install does create a
fvwm2 folder, but it contains only a system,fvwmrc file.  Is this
correct, iam using v 1.24 but it was compiled in the distribution of
Linux, I am using slackware linux when I run MakeMakefiles, it mostly
creates nosuch file directory messages, samething with make install make
install.man.  Thanks for any help.  Sorry this is a pretty bonehead
question.

Hello,

 I made this request several months back on this list. Does anyone have a
patch for Fvwm-2.0.XX which allows "boxed" icons? I do not want
AfterStep-style gradient fills, just normal boxed icons a la
Mwm/Dtwm/4Dwm. Thanks!

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I am running fvwm-2.0.45. I am using AddTitleStyle to have the upper
bar of each window with a gradient color(if that is what they call it).

My setup is the following....

 AddTitleStyle   ActiveUp        HGradient 64 NavyBlue SteelBlue3

The same goes for ActiveDown, I vary the color slightly for Inactive windows.

When I invoke Netscape, the following warning appears...

   Warning: Cannot allocate default colormap entry

And Netscape's colors are gone, that is, I only see a somewhat black and white
Netscape interface. I commented the AddTitleStyle lines in my rc file and 
Netscape comes out normal, no warnings.

Can anyone explains why is this? or how I can possibly fix this problem.

At the moment I have the AddTitleStyle lines commented, but would like to
have that nice gradient on the upper bar working, along --of course-- with 
Netscape. 

I suspect Netscape is the culprit here, but I am not certain.

Thx.

I'm using fvwm2.0.45, and having trouble getting rxvt to work with
FVWMbuttons. Basically, I can't get an rxvt window to launch from
the button. The button command is:

*FvwmButtons Local  una.xpm   Exec "rxvt" rxvt -fn fixed &

Typing just the rxvt -fn fixed & part on the command line works.

Any ideas what could be going on?

maybe rxvt isn't in the path of fvwm?  If you start fvwm from xdm as
apposed to startx, you won't get always get the same PATH as a login
shell would.  Try putting in the full pathname.

Netscape allocates a very big colour map all to itself when it starts up.  
You have taken 64 of those colours into your title bars.  Unless you can 
support 16k colours or more, I would avoid the greedy title bars.  If you 
have an 8 bit colour depth (256 max. colours), there is a FAQ somewhere - 
sorry don't have the URL - that will help you tidy up that colour map.  I 
think there is something in the Afterstep distribution too.

You could also try invoking netscape with the -install switch to install 
its own colour map - but that might give you more psychedelia than a mere 
mortal can survive..:-)

It sounds like you might only have 8-bit graphics, meaning you have
a colourmap of only 256 colours. Giving the 64 argument to HGradient
eats up 64 of these colours. Your gradient looks very smooth, though!

Netscape requires, and will take, lots of colours. You can get around this
as a colourmap problem by starting Netscape as 'netscape -install',
which installs Netscape with its own colourmap, though you will
get flashing as you move in and out of the application window.

However, if you eat up 64 of 256 colours for each titlebar you're
probably going to have problems with other applications too.
The only solution with an 8-bit card is to reduce this number and
put up with rougher gradients.

Doh! That's it. What a stupid mistake on my part, that's always one of the
first things I check when having a problem, and for some reason it slipped
my mind this time.

Excuse me while I slap myself around a bit.

whyt fvwm say to you when you click the button (tail -f
/var/log/messages) ??
and try:
Exec exec rxvt &
     ^^^^

i don't know why but i have sometimes problems in FvwmButtons when i
don't use the second exec.. i have this with gimp (Exex gimp & =
fvwmButtons crash) ans xterm + rxvt..

when this not work then try to use the full path (type rxvt)..
this works for me with THE GIMP..

Hi

Why would someone ever need 64 steps in the gradient title bar?

Suppose you have titlebars oh 24 pixels height. A 24 steps gradient
will allocate each row of your titlebar with yet another color in the
range you gave. Do you really nee that? Try to put 12 steps, or even
8. It will suffice certainely. Make some tests. I bet  a 64 steps
gradient will at any moment look better than a one of 24 steps. Maybe
only because of the loooong time it will take to be drawn, thus giving
a sexy lazyness effect :-).

I've just upgraded to fvwm2.  Compile went fine.  I used to use FvwmAudio
under fvwm1, but it doesn't seem to be working for me now.  Here's my 
segment under .fvwm2rc:

############################################################################
# FvwmAudio
#
*FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/local/bin/play
*FvwmAudioDir /usr/local/lib/sounds
*FvwmAudio startup roadrunner.au
*FvwmAudio shutdown homer-doh-echo.au
#*FvwmAudio unknown cat-1.au
*FvwmAudio destroy_window barney-awww.au
*FvwmAudio iconify homer-wohoo.au
*FvwmAudio deiconify no_prob.au
*FvwmAudio delete_window barney-belch.au
#*FvwmAudio add_window    ??
#*FvwmAudio toggle_paging ??

*FvwmAudioDelay 10

play does work, and the .au files I've listed are in the directory shown.

I also have it enabled under init and restart:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmButtons
#+              "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+               "I" Module FvwmAudio
+               "I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen xterm] Focus
+               "I" CursorMove 30 40

AddToFunc "RestartFunction" "I" Module FvwmButtons
#+              "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+               "I" Module FvwmAudio
+               "I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen xterm] Focus
+               "I" CursorMove 30 40

I've also tried manually running it under FvwmTalk.  So far I get nothing,
no messages in the tty I started X from, nothing in syslog or messages,
and no listing of FvwmAudio under ps.  Any suggestions?

Oh yes, I'm running Linux 2.0.30, kernel sound drivers,  and XFree 3.2.

Thanks!
Stew Benedict

Hi,

i love the 'Sticky-Look' (see atachment) and i want to have this without
the 'Sticky-feature' :)
i mean, i want only that my windows look like be sticky and that they
aren't sticky.. you know what i mean ?-)
i use HGradient and can make this sticky look with VGradient :(

Good morning,

	As a general rule, I don't like activeplacement. I get along fine
with windows that pop up whereer they want - simply because I usually open
a window when I need it. On the other hand, I sometimes want to have it.
As a first step I have a menu which turns Active on and off. But what I
thought could be neat is an ActivePlacement which has a time-out
parameter. A window-frame appears, and if I don't move the mouse for a few
seconds (because I'm either busy, or just away), the window self-appears
randomally (or Smartly or whatever). What do you think?

PS:	Apparantly, ActivePlacemnt is not as smart as ctwm's? In ctwm you
can resize the window while placing it. Now _this_ is a productivity tool
IMO.

This should be relatively easy to implement.  Could even steal some code
from the autoraise module...  Which raises the question, Should there be a
placement module?  Can there be, if the server is grabbed during
placement?  Hmmmmm....

This is a moldy oldie.  It was first implemented (I believe), in uwm, the
original window manager that was dropped starting X11R3.  It is in twm and
all derivatives, mwm, and a couple of others.  Even xmag uses the same
logic.  Personally, I never used it, found it useless.  However, to each
his own....  

Draw up a table of the mouse buttons, and the behavior that you expect for
each.  Might not be so hard.

<Gulp>? On what grounds? I mean, they both need timing, but what can there
be common to both? (OTOH, I hardly looked at the sources, and I know
almost nothing about X programming, so...)

> Which raises the question, Should there be a

I have no idea regarding the second question... But here's a sad point
about all this modules stuff: The strongest AIZ that I can find at work
starts "No more proccesses"ing me after very few clients. I run
FvwmTaskBar (oh, yeah, didn't I mention it? I use fvwm95 20.42a) so it
comes to a point I start killing xbiffs and so one by one. This is one
disadvantage I see for using modules. Another thing is that starting a
module is still relatively slow. Often it takes 3 to 7 seconds for
FvwmIdentify to fire up. (This is on a range of machines: Pentium/Linux,
RS6000/AIX, SGIs/irix, Suns Sparcs & Ultras running SunOS and Solaris).

Yap, even xmag. I was not around for X11R3.  In fact, for quite some time
I thought "R5" was just a part of the name, and not a revision number...
At times it can be very useful, for example, when you spawn a new netscape
window with button-2, you can resize it to not hide your current reading
matirial. I also thought about (long ago) a combo move/resize module,
which will allow one to draw a rectangle on the screen (like you draw a
rectangle in a drawing program), and this changes a window's geometry at 
once. Much quicker than moving-then-sizing when you want to take an
annoying window out of the way.

> Draw up a table of the mouse buttons, and the behavior that you expect for
> each.  Might not be so hard.

Hmm, now that you mentioned xmag, I never quite got the grip of its button
selections. I would use:

-	mouse movement = window movement

-	button-1 down = nop

-	button-1 release = accept geometry, show window

-	button-2 drag = change window size. This moves a point which
is the original bottom-left corner, although you can make it any
other corner by dragging it to the right (ahem, left) place.

-	button-3 click = I don't care where you put the window. Places the
window randomally or smartly out of the way.

-	button-3 click while button-1 or -2 are down = toggle a flag,
which will cause the window to iconify as soon as we decide where we want
it. 

I think it's a good set: Whatever you want to do with this window, it's
at most just one drag and one click away. Plus it let's you change your
mind, something that xmag, I think, won't let you do.

Yours,

Exactly the timing.  Ther rest of the code (the 2 types of placement) has
already been implemented.  Now, all we need to do is to connect them
together.

I have a dual headed Sparc 5, 64megs of RAM, Solaris 2.5.  FvwmIdent pops
up almost instantaneously, as do xterms and other small clients.  And you
should not run out of processes unless you have LOTS of ram in a very
heavlily loaded machine, or there is some accounting scheme.

It is an accepted fact that the modules should be dynamically loaded
libraries, much like the modules from the linux kernel.  It is just that
there is no easy way of doing this in an architecture/compiler indep sort
of way.  So multiple processes it is.

That sounds like a good idea.  It would require some major code changes
though...

Well, your button choices are not what I would have chosen, but they seem
to work.  I will take a look, and see what I can do, (in between bursts of
actual work that someone is paying me for.... ).  We'll see.

So do I. It was supposed to be AIX. Every one of a bunch of RS6000s, with
32MB RAM plus 64MB VM get out of processes really soon. This is of course
nothing to blame fvwm with, but OTOH three xterms are alot more than three
modules. Any day.

Nope, no schemes in here.

At the time I worked with SCM, a scheme interpreter. Although I didn't use
this feature, it does support some sort of dynamically loadable objs, And
it is already implemented for many, many platforms (including VMS and
Amiga).

<pause as I browse through the code>

OTOH, I can't say the SCM code excels in clarity. But it is GPL.

I just surfed in from your Yahoo listing.  It's good to see that

you are listed there...

As a webmaster or webmarketer, you know that getting traffic from 
the search engines and directories is absolutely crucial to the 
success of your (or your client's) site.  You have probably used 
Submit-it or another service to submit your sites.   Submit-it is 
a really great service .... but, as you may be aware, the search 
engines don't always process the submissions, and they also drop 
many sites that used to be listed out of the directories to keep 
the size of their database down, so you never can be sure if you 
have an active listing, till now.

So, we have launched a new service called did-it.com at 
http://www.did-it.com. The did-it.com Detective will check any 
URL to see if the URL is listed in the search engines and e-mail 
you a status report FREE OF CHARGE.  If you find you're not listed, 
you can utilize our Did-it submission service.  What is unique about 
this service is that it will monitor the status of your site on all 
the popular search engines and automatically resubmit you wherever 
you're not listed. Today, that's the ONLY way you can be sure you 
get listed and stay listed, automatically.

Come take a look... http://www.did-it.com  and use our detective 
service FREE!

BTW, If you like our service you can also become a did-it.com 
Partner.  In exchange for putting a small icon next to a link to us, 
you will become eligible for did-it.com Partner benefits.  Check out 
the partner program at: http://www.did-it.com/  click on the partner 
icon.

Thanks so much.


Regards,
The did-it.com team.

Huh? Since when was the fvwm mailing list a webmaster? (or worse, a
webmarketer? <shudder>)

Can "bulk" mails be stripped from this mailling list by majordomo?

the did-it team or the id-iot team?

Fvwm groks mouse button two just like twm and derivatives do.  But it
doesn't grok mouse button three for vertical maximization while doing
active placement :-(

Something is wrong.  I have seen a Sparc SLC, 20MHZ, 16mb RAM running
hundreds of processes at once.  Not very quickly, but.....  Your machines
are doing something very strange.

I like the button 3 thing that you chose.  My version would probably have
been a subset of yours.  Of course, the right way to do it is to make it
specifiable in the .fvwmrc file...

More fodder for the filter, folks; please don't bother replying.

(BTW, the filters trapped the removal request; it seems some misguided soul
actually thinks that following the instructions will remove you from
anything.  In reality, they use information from the removal request to
send you more mail.)

For those of you who didn't bother, I visited the web page.  It appears
somehow this 'imeec' company which promotest ethical use of email marketing
has somehow gone through Yahoo and spammed email addresses of potential
companies.  Somehow it thought the fvwm mailing list was a company.  Whatever.

Anyway, the solution is to unsubscribe the fvwm mailing list from their
company's list, and I also am cc'ing this message to the company's admin,
hoping that this type of thing in the future can be avoided (sending email
to list serve addresses)...

Please, lets not have a dozen people respond to whatever '2nd step' they
send to this list to remove the fvwm list from their list.  I'll take
care of it.

Dear FVWM enthusiasts,

I have set up my .fvwmrc to give a large virtual desktop
and fairly smooth scrolling using the commands

EdgeScroll 5 7
EdgeResistance 3 20

However, if I drag a window across the edge of the viewport
the screen flips by a whole page, which is not what I want.

Is it possible to get the same scrolling behaviour when dragging
as when just moving the cursor?
If so how?

Any help will be much appreciated.

Brandon

Could be, could be... It's probably the AIX's fault. Of what I've learnt
in OS course (Where the Multics is regarded innovative...) UNIX use a
static array to store the process table. Perhaps a kernel recompilation is
needed. Unfrotunately(?) the AIX on my university are tagged "zero
maintanince, wait till they all die". Nobody is going to recompile
anything for them.

Of course. Orally. <g>

Sigh.  No, the answer is to ignore the spam and let me filter it out.  By
interacting with them further, you

1) Just give me more filter fodder (I've already received several copies of
   their stupid removal notice)
2) Put your name on all of their lists.  They will now spam you directly.

They do not listen to your requests to be removed.  They only do it as a
front to seem reasonable and to collect more addresses.

That response will never make it here.

I'm trying to make fvwm2 and having some configuration problems:

I'm trying to compile for solaris and I don't have the file xpm.h in any
of the standard include paths that the makefiles look in.  ( I'm not sure
it these files come with a standard openwindos installation??? )

eg it is not in:

/usr/openwin/include/X11
/usr/X11/include
...

I do have it in another directory but I can't copy it into any of the
standard directories because I do not have permission. 

The same goes when linking - I don't have the xpm.a library in any of the
standard places but do have it in another directory. 

Is there anyway to change Fvwm.tmpl so that when the Makefiles are made
they tell the compiler to look for these files in directories other then
the standard ones or some way to tell xmkmf to do this. 

Thanks Steve.

Messing with xmkmf is not for the faint of heart.  I convinced Motif 2.0
to compile on Linux once, and that cured me forever.

Pretend that xpm is in /home/user/xpm/[lib|include] for arguments sake.

You can add -I/home/user/xpm/include to the INCLUDES directive, and add
-L/home/user/xpm/lib to the LIBS directive in the Makefile.  This is evil.

Or you can change the XPM_INCLUDES and XPM_LIBRARIES in Fvwm.tmpl and
MakeMakefiles or xmkmf -a.  This is nicer.

It was:
#if HasXpm
    XPM_DEFINES = -DXPM
   XPM_INCLUDES = XpmIncs
  XPM_LIBRARIES = XpmLibs -lXpm
#endif

it should be:
#if HasXpm
    XPM_DEFINES = -DXPM
   XPM_INCLUDES = -I/<some dir>/include
  XPM_LIBRARIES = -L/<some dir>/lib -lXpm
#endif

Have Fun!

It's definitely AIX's fault.  If nobody's fiddled with it, the per-user
process limit is set at something ridiculously small.  (32, I think, under
4.1.5.  I don't know beans about 3.x.)

Nope!  Luckily (again, under 4.x), no recompilation is needed.  What's needed
is a user with root authority which will run a command like:

chdev -l sys0 -a maxuproc=512

Well, that's how mine is set, anyway.  But I'm the only user on mine, so the
extra resources that are taken up with the higher limits aren't multiplied
by large numbers of other people.  YMMV, but I certainly don't think you
should be running out of processes as soon as you say you are.

I think it's a problem within Fvwm. I have an application that constantly
hides and shows forms (popup icon menus). To prevent them from drifting
around (n.b. this problem also appears with the FvwmIconMan module and
some others) you can use fl_set_form_geometry() if you don't mind
overriding the WM's default window placement with your own "hard-wired"
one.

Hello there!

I'm using fvwm-2.0.45 on a linux and a SINIX V5.43 box with identical
configuration files. The config file contains a definition of the
'IconPath':

  IconPath	/home/mschmitz/.pixmaps:<some-more-dirs>

The directory '/home/mschmitz/.pixmaps' holds a lot of pixmaps (on
both machines!) which I'd like to use on my desktop for e.g. my xterm
windows:

  Style "xterm"		Icon xterm.xpm

Everything works fine in case I use fvwm on my linux box, but when I run
fvwm on the SINIX machine I don't see any icon. Is this a know bug or
is it just a stupid user error?

Please CC all answers to mschmitz@iname.com, I did not subscribe to
the mailing list.

Michael.

Hi All,

I have a quick question on Key bindings. How can I add key binding to
special keys found on Sun's Type 5 keyboards. I'm running Solaris 2.5.1
on a SS5 and I would like to do something like:

 Key Props                      exec some command

I looked in the doc and on the web site but couldn't find anything on keys
other than direction and function keys.

thanks

the props key should be something like L3.  check the default .fvwm2rc.  i'm
pretty sure it has key bindings for the front and open keys which you'll see as
L5 and L7.

The Props key's default keysym is "F13".

My key binding:

Key F13   R A Beep

You can figure this out with "xev" but I recommend using "xkeycaps".
A search should turn it up.

Some further notes about Sun type 5 keyboards....

In addition, type 5 keyboards also have a few keys which, by default
under Solaris 2.4, don't have keysyms--in particular, the power
management keys in the top right hand corner.

These keys can also be assigned to actions in fvwm, but they must first
be mapped to keysyms with xmodmap.  For instance, I have a file named
".Xmodmap-sun" containing the lines
    keycode 52 = IA1
    keycode  9 = IA2
    keycode 11 = IA3
    keycode 55 = IA4
    keycode 22 = IA5

By running the command "xmodmap .Xmodmap-sun," the four power management
keys get named IA1 through IA4, and the unlabeled key between "Help" and
"F1" gets named IA5.

I then bind these to actions in my fvwm2 config file:

    DestroyFunc StartWorkman
    AddToFunc StartWorkman  "I" Next [workman] Exec workman -s play
    +                       "I" None [workman] Exec workman -iconic

    Key IA1         A       N       Exec workman -s pause
    Key IA1         A       S       Function StartWorkman
    Key IA2         A       N       Exec workman -s back
    Key IA3         A       N       Exec workman -s fwd
    Key IA4         A       N       Exec workman -s stop
    Key IA4         A       S       Exec workman -s eject

    Key IA5         A       N       WarpTo  FvwmPager 10 10 1

Note that xmodmap only needs to be used for keys which do not have a
keysym; xev will tell you whether a key is bound to a keysym, and gives
you the keycode you need to supply to xmodmap in order to assign one;
however, I believe the five keys above are the only unnamed ones under
Solaris 2.4.  If you don't like the names IA1-IA5, the file
<X11/keysymdef.h>, or /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB, lists the available keysym
names; pick any that aren't being used.  See the man page for xmodmap
for details.

Hope this helps,

Use xmodmap to give them a keysym, and go from there.

I used to use the "window" key for compose, and the "menu" one as a
sort of replacement for "Front", which I missed from when I used Suns :)

It depends on the OS and X server, actually.

Solaris 2.5 running OpenWin is L3, my .fvwmrc shows:

Key L3          A       N       Menu Window-Ops

SunOS 4.1.x running X11R6 (OpenWin 3.0 blowz) is "SunProps", my .fvwmrc shows:

Key SunProps    A       N       Menu Window-Ops

Since I dual-boot into either OS, I just specify definitions for both and
let it go.

Here's the total of my key configuration for Solaris 2.5.1:

# OpenWin (Solaris 2) keybindings
Key L1          A       N       Exec  exec xlock &
Key L2          A       N       WindowList
Key L3          A       N       Menu Window-Ops
Key L5          WI      N       RaiseLower
Key L6          WI      N       Move-or-Raise
Key L7          WI      N       Iconify-Func
Key L8          W       N       Resize-or-Raise
Key L9          A       N       Menu Utilities

If you want to experiment, use xev (as was mentioned here many times).

olwm / olvwm would use it to do the equivalent (in FVWM) of a Raise
(or maybe a RaiseLower)

There's also an "Open" key which would (de/)iconify a window.  Both
quite useful.

you can use xev to watch which keyname gets sent to it. Probably the
key is not called props, even though it is labelled that way. BTW FYI
all keynames used can be found in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h

Good luck,

Again, use xev to find what number the keys are, and xmodmap to give them some 
meaning.  For example, if shift, control, meta and alt aren't enough, you 
could create hyper or super modifier keys.  Depending on what keyboard you've 
got, you may find xkeycaps will help you bind the keys (it doesn't have 
*every* keyboard, however).

Good morning,

	I've decided to take my first shot at X "programming" by writing a
module I described here (on fvwm list) a few days ago. The idea is a
module which will let you move and resize a window in one drag of the
mouse - the way you draw a rectangle in a paint program. I have now a
module which let one draw a rubberband frame on the root. Now I have 
a few questions:

1. Is there a definite source of information about module programming, in
addition to copy-and-pasting from existing modules?

2. How do I tell fvwm (from within a module) to move and resize a window?
Preferably, I'd want fvwm to it simultanously, altough if not possible, a
resize-followed-by-a-move should be good enough. 

3. Is there a way to get from fvwm the XORVALUE value?

If anyone wants to take a loot and comment on the source, the whole 5K of
it are available as http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elad/GEOM.tar.gz (or by mail
from me). It compiles nicely under SunOS, and runs nicely with fvwm2-95
v2.0.43a.

Thanks, 

 _

There was a great article on it in the X Resource, Issue 12 I believe.
Maybe it was 14.  I think that there are a couple of web pages as well.

unmap the window, resize it, move it, remap it.  Look in FvwmPager code.
That module has to be able to move windows.

Good luck!

Yes. Look at docs/modules.tex in the fvwm2 distribution.

That document is very dated!  It does not list half of the messages 
that can be send to/from Fvwm.  I had to take apart other modules to 
fully understand what is going on.  Also, look at the source code 
<wherever fvwm is>/fvwm/lib/module.c for some utility code that helps 
writing modules.

I think this may be out of date, since a couple new message types were
added. Nothing fundamental changed though, and it's unlikely he'd use the new
message types (which are M_STRING, and M_MINI_ICON).

Elad should also look at how other modules do things. When I started writing
FvwmIconMan, I found most of the available modules were coded pretty
poorly. Things have gotten better since then. You might look at FvwmForm,
FvwmIconMan, and FvwmButtons. Basically you need to figure out:

1. How to read the fvwmrc file (link in fvwmlib, and use the stuff in Parse.c
   and use GetConfigLine in Module.c). If you want to get into slick ways to
   parse the config lines, you're on your own :-). I don't think any of the
   modules really do a correct/clean job of it, including mine. I intend to
   rewrite how FvwmIconMan tokenizes things, so if you come up with something
   clever, please let me know.
2. How to set up things to receive events from fvwm and X (use
   XConnectionNumber to find the X socket, and use select to switch between
   reading X events and fvwm events. You probably can get away with just
   ignoring fvwm events while rubberbanding). You will need to keep tabs on
   where the various windows are though. It would be really cool if your
   module could do some SmartPlacement like stuff to keep minimize
   overlapping. I don't use smartplacement myself, but I bet some people would
   like this.
3. How to send and receive messages to/from fvwm. (use ReadFvwmPacket in
   fvwmlib, and then you might use the unions that I defined in FvwmIconMan,
   or that the FvwmForm module uses to get at the fields).
4. How to set up the Imakefile (cut and paste). If you plan on making this
   module into something that you'll be spending a lot of time tinkering with
   and making cool - which I would recommend since there's a lot of room for
   the module you have planned to grow (in other words, please make it cool!)
   then you might look into setting things up so you can compile your module
   both with and without the fvwm source around. I can send you how I do
   things if you like. Basically I have two Imakefiles, and a private copy of
   fvwmlib and some ifdef's here and there.

As for things I could see this module doing: "smart resizing" like smart
placement, so as I rubberband my window, my outline gets "guided" by the
module to stay clear of other windows. Not sure how this would work exactly,
but it could be cool. Having the module remember former locations/sizes of
windows, so I could move a window back to previous configutions
quickly. Having some keybindings during the rubberband process that would
maximize horizontally/vertically, move window all the way to the
left/top/bottom/right of the screen, move window to a given desk or page, etc.
Basically, everything anyone might want to do while moving or resizing a
window.

It is definitely out of date.  I'd like to fix that somewhat in one of
the upcoming betas...

Yup - other modules are the best "docs" right now.

Acually, I noticed not too long ago that you were doing that, and I
think that's a really good idea.  As part of a cleanup of the existing
module interface, I'd like to make something like that (structs &
funcs to work with them) standard in libfvwm.a for any module to use.

OK people... with the new list sorta up and running... I'd like to make a
few points:

	1) I've started a new page, and it's in it's preliminary
	   works at:

		http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~kvarga01/fOX

	   Please let me know what you think.

	2) Please stop subscribing to the lin99-dev list. It is out
	   of date and will stop working soon (as soon as I get root
	   privies to fix the problems the list creator made :)

	3) If you don't know what the fOX project is about, check out
	   the page, look a little at Xclass, see if you like it, then
	   join the list :)

Please note that the page is very preliminary. I wanted a different look
(and I really like this one). It may still have refferences to lin99 or
Linux 99, please ignore those. I plan to add more soon. Well... as soon as
soon is :)

Hi, friends

I'm too lazy to search now in the archive to see who started the
discussion about how to program a module for Move/Resize but
... however!

I think an excellent example could be found in Cascade and Tile
modules. They're doing exactly this: moving and (at one's will)
resize. With some calculus before.

Hope this helps

There are a few interesting shots lurking at
<http://www.catalog.com/hopkins/piemenus/index.html>, as well as
several interesting references and a (somewhat clunky) implementation
on top of tvtwm.  (Yes, the thought of writing a module for fvwm has
crossed my mind occasionally, too...)

That'd be great!  Mouse button "chords" could also be used with nice

doing a move aborts the move.

Good morning,

Ahh! Panic mode on. And I thought it would be a quick'n'dirty
five-minuter. Let's see.. I have a working thing already. Code looks like,
grab pointer. draw rubberband (copied from fvwm code and
removed all function-calls which resisted the link), ungrab mouse,
XMoveResizeWindow(), XSync() (That damn XSync costed me hours of
misunderstandings), return. 

I'm working now on complying to client's resizing constraints. Apparntely
fvwm won't tell you about the window's aspect ratio requirements..? I will
disturb myself later with such things as configuratablity. 

Size report... let's see... 24K tar. Mostly prob'ly borrowed code. Have to
catch the bus home now. Thanks everybody for the many good replies and
advices!

I have a root menu that I display using Popup on the left mouse
button.  This menu has two bars at the top, then the title, then one
more bar before the menu items.

AddToMenu MainMenu
+       "Main Menu"                             Title
+       "Xterms"                                Popup Xterm-Menu
+       "FVWM Modules"                          Popup Module-Menu
+       "Configure Menu"                        Popup Config-Menu
+       "Quit"                                  Quit

Mouse   1       R       A       Popup    "MainMenu"


------------------
------------------
   Main  Menu
------------------
 Xterms
 FVWM Modules
 Configure Menu
 Quit
------------------


If I pop up the menu, and then move my mouse between the top two bars,
FVWM generates the following message, every time:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /db/sds/bin/bin5/fvwm45/modules/
Permission denied

This only occurs when the mouse is left between those two bars.  I'm
running FVWM 2.0.45 with the animate window patch and the patch to
rearrange the window list using Focus Follows Mouse in the manner
similar to Click to Focus (so FlipFocus works).

By the way, where can one find all these patches?

I've underlined the place where your problem is occurring with carets
(^) below.  Try defining the menu using the following:

    AddToMenu MainMenu "Main Menu" Title
    +       "Xterms"                                Popup Xterm-Menu
    +       "FVWM Modules"                          Popup Module-Menu
    +       "Configure Menu"                        Popup Config-Menu
    +       "Quit"                                  Quit

Are you using mwm-style menus?  Sounds like you are.  You should see
the `Main Menu' appearing before the top two bars.

        OK, I grabbed a quick screen capture of piewm with a pie menu up.
It's a bit large (194K, 1024x768 desktop) to post to the list, so I put it
up on my Web site temporarily. If you want to grab it, just fetch

                http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/Pie-desk1.jpg

        It's not much to look at. I've never bothered doing any serious
configuration of piewm, as I don't really use it: I just bring it up 
occasionally for the novelty. Anyway, there's a pie menu in the upper
right hand corner, just below the icon manager box that's still labelled
"TWM" (I *told* you I didn't do any configuration.)

        Now, lest you set yourself up for disappointment...the "pies" aren't
round. They're conventional rectangles, but they're subdivided as though
someone were cutting a pie: the menu selections fan out from the center,
each occupying a "slice" of this rectangular pie. ("Pie are square...??? 
Son, what the hell they been teachin' you at that fancy college?")


        Cheers,
        Bob

I am disappointed.  I suppose you could use a shaped window, to make it
sort of oval.

BTW, "Turbo-Studly"?

Thanks, your suggestion seemed to fix the problem, but it still seems
like this should be caught somewhere rather than generating an error.

I would like my FvwmPager to appear flush against the bottom right of my
screen but it seems that fvwm translates the "-0" as a "+0".  Does
anyone know how to fix this?

Thanks,
Noel

Hi people,

  This is my first post to this list.  I have been reading the list
  and looking in the archives hoping someone would've mentioned my
  question but I have had no luck with finding any discussion on the
  subject.

  I used to use AfterStep till I noticed its unstability (compared
  to fvwm 1.xx).  But during my use of AfterStep I got very used to
  how each window is represented to the user, meaning each window
  has a titlebar, and a bottom border with no side borders.  I like
  this simple look.

  I wonder if fvwm 1.xx or 2.xx are able to emulate this look?  If
  so, can anyone let me know how I can achieve this look and feel?
  If not, how hard would it be to implement this feature to allow
  users to define in .fvwm2rc how they would like their borders to
  be in the next fvwm 2.xx releases?

  Thanks!

Patrick Keshishian ...

Of course.

Look in the man page for things like NoHandles, etc.

Yeah, it tells you it won't do what the guy was asking about... :)

NoHandles takes ALL of them off in every version I'm aware of.  I just
looked and tried some variations on my system at work.  AfterStep has a title 
bar and a handle
on the bottom of the window.

It shouldn't be a terribly difficult hack to make the code work this
way.

Ah.  I didn't notice the comment about the bottom border.

well... +0+0 is upper left corner, and -0-0 is the lower right corner... 

(+0-0 should be lower left, and -0+0 upper right... if not, switch these
last two around).

I think the first number reffers to the # of X pixels. If it starts with a
+, the number represents the number of pixels the image starts from the
left... If it starts with -, the number represents the number of pixels
from the right. This is similar for the second number (the Y pixel
coordinate).

I have two (simple, hopefully) questions. I am running fvwm-2.0.45
on HP workstation with HPUX 10.20.

1. Where can I get xpdr? Print choice on the window menu uses it.
   Is there something else I could use?

2. Is there a screedump command that will work in fvwm2?

Sincerely,

Your questions aren't relevant to fvwm (or any other window manager).
A window manager (as the name implies) manages your windows/desktop(s).

Place, Move, Resize, Icon/DeIcon, List, Po-pup Menus and start application.

You need to find xpdr/screedump for your platform. Try it on the
command line to see how it's working (from xterm) and when you
are happy with the command and its option add it to one of you menus.

I know I'm not answering your question (were to get tools for HPUX from)
but I hope you got a better view of what a window manager is.

Regards,
Yehuda.

This is right, except that fvwm has historically (at least since
1.24something) had trouble with `-0-0' and such geometries.  You should
use `-1-1' instead (or `+1-1' (lower left) or `-1+1' (upper right)).

that the poster was specifying -1 instead of +0-1 :)

        Yeah, I was disappointed too when I saw it. I suspect that Don
Hopkins just threw this hack of tvtwm together as a quick proof of 
concept exercise. To judge from his papers on the subject, he seems to
have been more interested in the ergonomics of navigating the pie layout
than in the actual visual appearance of the window.

        If you chase enough links in Don's pages (referenced in Theo
Honohan's post), you will *eventually* stumble across a screenshot of
a circular pie menu. It takes a bit of patience to find (the links are
sometimes circular, too), but I think it was the screenshot of his 
SimCity work. This, I believe, is what everyone's looking for when the
recurring pie menu discussion crops up.

        It would seem that an ambitious module writer could probably
find most of what he needs by perusing the shape mask handling for
shaped pixmap icons, together Don's pie menu code from piewm. If anyone
decides to give it a try, *please* go the module route. I'm eager to see
Chuck finish cleaning up the core code and get 2.1 out  --  so he can get
on with the Great Style Flag Rewrite (TM).


        Cheers,
        Bob

I have been using fvwm2 for several months; here are some
remarks about its performace. Could they be bugs in window
manager or naively due to inexperience.

- copying to clipboard.
  while highlighting text (that is copying window buffer to the
  clipboard) in xterm, I cannot scroll the window to go beyond
  its borders.

- restarting fvwm2
  windows that have been set sticky, do not preserve
  their status as fvwm has been restarted during the same
  session.

  while windows preserve their page-position within their
  desktop, a window that has been moved to a next desktop
  does not recover the change, after restarting fvwm2.
  At the restart, windows return to the desktop where they
  had been created from.

  Focus is correctly set to the current desktop, yet the
  pointer forgets its last cohordinates before restarting,
  being always placed in the first page.


thank you

Paolo Pumilia

I am used to open a note pad from time to time, anywhere in my
workplace. My note pad is a plain text file edited through vi in
xterm and i can pop it up either by key composition or selecting
a menu item in fvwm2 root context.
Often it happens i try to open my notes file twice simultaneously,
having forgotten a vi session is already active on another desktop
of my workplace.
Here my question follows: is there a viable solution in order to
avoid opening twice the sape file?

A further question comes to my mind: 
May it be possible to apply a condition to the execution of a command
in fvwm2 ? In affirmative case, the window manager could be asked
to execute a script file; then, depending on the result, to start
one function or another.  In the present case, the script would
check whether the requested (my notes) file is already open.

thank you

I have a window-manager-independent solution to this problem, called
`xcmd'.  Here's the LSM entry:

Begin3
Title:          xcmd
Version:        1.5
Entered-date:   11AUG97
Description:    Xcmd is a front-end for starting programs under X11.
                You can tell xcmd to look for a window with a specific
                class, resource name, or title string (using the
                `--find-<property>' options); if it finds one or more,
                xcmd will `raise' them, otherwise it will run the
                command you specify. You can tell xcmd to run commands
                that create their own windows (using `--xcmd'), or to
                run commands inside a terminal window (using `--cmd')
                with various options.

The fast and simple way I can think about is to write a script that will
maintain the lock and start the script from the menu instead of starting vi
with your input file directly.

I'm including (an untested) csh script that should do the job.

(To get the script error messages you should start this script inside
 a diffrent xterm)
 
 
---- cut here, save as file notepad.csh and chmod u+x notepad.csh
#! /bin/csh -f

set LOCK = /tmp/note-pad-$USER.lock
set NOTE_FILE = a/path/to/the/note/pad/file.txt

if ( -f $LOCK) then
    echo "Note pad is open. Close it first."
    exit -1
endif

# now put the lock.
touch $LOCK

# Edit the file.
xterm -e vi $NOTE_FILE

# Reset the lock.

/bin/rm -f $LOCK

exit 0
--- cut here ---

Good luck,
Yehuda.

I have seen examples posted to this list of fvwm2 functions referencing
the existence of a window of a particular name, popping it up and warping
to it if it exists.  If it does not exist, then create it in the usual
way.  I think the primary objects of interest were web browsers and mail
clients.  I use my FvwmPager with color- and name-coding to serve this
function.  I will try to find any references to this mechanism that I may
have archived.

Others have responded already to this.  As mentioned, lock files are
reasonable as a mechanism.  But they are not as reliable as the window
existence unless the lock file contains a PID number which can be polled
by ps for its current existence.  I use this mechanism for certain
controls processes here at work, so that stale lock files can be
automatically cleared.

This solution was posted a while back.  I find it very useful.  Give
credit to lar3ry

<original>
AddToFunc       "warp-or-run"
+       "I"     Next [$0] Iconify -1
+       "I"     Next [$0] Focus
+       "I"     None [$0] $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

The first argument ($0) is the name of the window to search for.  The
next arguments (up to 9) are the 'Exec' command to run if the window
isn't found.

Using the new FvwmButons module, you can call it as such:

*FvwmButtons(Icon mini-filemgr.xpm, Action 'warp-or-run "moxfm*" Exec
moxfm')

Hello all... To those of you that have cared enough to check out the fOX
homepage and write me about the problems with accessing it, I'd simply
like to say Thank you.

The truth is that I picked a really crappy time to announce the new
version of the page and it's location :) As soon as I made the
announcement, FIU telecom (the dept. that run's our T1 access and stuff)
announced that they'd be doing some major work over the week/weekend...
This coupled with some weird network problems on the computer science side
of the campus (to which I was a witness to and which cut me off from my
home directory) has left my homepage in a very unstable state.

If you can, please wait about a week for things to stabilize. The primary
site will still be:

		http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~kvarga01/fOX

however, if you REALLY want to see it, and you're having problems with the
above site, you can also visit:

		http://www.hudat.com/fOX

The above is *NOT* to be confused with the primary site. It is only there
as proof-of-exhistance :) It will *NOT* be kept up to date and will prolly
be removed in a few weeks.

I have personally validated the two above addresses using non-FIU dns
servers... However, there may still be problems. FIU Telecom's goals are
usually to make all adjustments when people aren't using the networked
computers, which happens to be between semesters. Right now, FIU is
between semesters, and the new semester will start approximately 1 week
from when you receive this email (next monday). Therefore, if you could
just be a bit patient... I'm sure we've all had weird net probs at one
point or another ;)

Hi all in the mailing list

I am sitting here and using fvwm (great WM) anyways i was using a SGI (4DWM) and
 i realized that i am missing something in my favorite WM and that is a way to 
have a program that senses the mount state of disks (cdroms really but Harddrive
s too would be nice) ala 4DWM where the unmounted CD is a CD-icon with and cd ju
st to be inserted into the drive and when mounted shows what kind of filesystem 
it has or if its a Audio CD (Is it possible to have it read from the MOUNT comma
nd what has been mounted) it would be greate and would enhance a already great 
WM. But as i am only a user and no programmer (I dont even know how to program)
so i would appriciate if it could be done the useability of the WM would be even
 greater so please all developers in the FVWM mailing list here you have somethi
ng new to figure out :))

Yeah, you're right. It is disappointing. I had this vision of a mouseclick
building a small circular menu, which grows larger as you drag the mouse
away from the center.

So... who _is_ writing Fvwm3.14 ? :-)

This is nothing to do with the window manager, but is a shortfall
of xterm. Highlight as much as you want from the current page, then
use the scrollbar to scroll down, and use the right mouse button
to click on the position you want the highlight extended to.

This is because the sticky attribute is unknown to the X server ... it
is an artifact of fvwm2. If you want the same windows to always
be sticky you can say
    Style "foo"  Sticky

A window's coordinates are maintained by the X server, so
they are not forgotten when the window manager quits. Desks, however,
are not known to the server.

No they didn't, they just searched for the string "Pager"!

What? If we do nothing we continue to get their junk mail. And if we

Sigh ...

That's funny... all my apps reappear on the correct screen and desktop
every time.  How is fvwm managing that since the server does not know?

I think this could be done for window attributes as well.  If you have to, 
store status in a temporary file.  I think Sun's window manager did/does
that.

Of course, wanting this should be pretty rare except when debugging an
fvwm setup, so you could always just wait till you are done before
worrying about sticky windows.

Good morning,

	I've searched and searched... there really is no way for a module
to get a window's aspect ratio from fvwm, is there? Can anyone tip me of
how to get this information from the client itself? 

	I actually think I've written something useful here. (First time
for everything). The rubberband now complies to size constraints (except
the aspect ratio, which is a shame). And I even think I found a decent
solution to interpreting the mouse buttons pushed. Next step is certainly
trying to add keyboard shortcuts, and maybe a Position window like Fvwm's. 
However, I've still didn't figure out a good use to mouse button 3. Since
this is (currently) a resize/move module, it won't be very useful to allow
iconifing or randomplacement...  would it? 

	If you want to test it (please do):

Since I haven't downloaded the module, I may be totally off base, but the
"I've still didn't figure out a good use to mouse button 3" sentence makes me
suspicious.

You shouldn't hardcode which button does what. If you are going to add
keyboard shortcuts then you'll need a way to bind commands (represented as
ASCII strings) to events (again ASCII) anyway, so you might as well support
the full fvwm "Key" and "Mouse" syntax. That's what I did for FvwmIconMan, and
it was pretty easy. You just need to rip some code out of fvwm to parse things
(or take it pre-ripped from FvwmIconMan). I can't think of any other module
off the top of my head which really allows keyboard shortcuts.

The best thing to do is come up with a list of things you could possible do,
and let the user bind them to whichever mouse/key events he wants. It's a good 
way of dealing with people who want you to add features that you personally
will never use. Just add the command and forget about it.

As I begin to get carpel tunnel from switching between the mouse and
keyboard, I begin to start trying to do as much as possible from the
keyboard, which is situated correctly.

I find that the WindowList action, when initiated from the keyboard,
and in the situation where the window is also chosen using the
keyboard, that the window chosen is not focused correctly.

A search of the archives yeilds the message
<31224F9D.3E37CADA@aries.tucson.saic.com> and it's followup, in which
this is mentioned, and Chuck mentions it is a known bug.

Has anyone found the solution to this bug yet?  I'd hate having to
debug it myself, since I need to debug from another terminal across
the hall, not having a dumb terminal connected to my workstation.

Yeah!  Now, could someone convince Robert Nation (or whoever is
currently maintaining FvwmPager) of that?  I find it a pain to have to
click left, then middle, to switch to desired window on desired page ...

Are you using pointer focus?  This is probably a problem I had, where
selecting a window from the win list wouldn't give it focus. 

fvwm does in fact give the window focus.  It then takes the focus away
because the pointer isn't in the window.  Make sense?  Anyway, I made a patch
that warps the pointer to the window so it will keep focus.  I use it so I can
switch windows with the keyboard using WindowList (bound to compose).  I don't
know if this is best solution because pointer warping is generally considered
evil, but it works for me.

I don't know why you need a dumb terminal to debug fvwm.  I don't have one.
I just have a menu option to restart to an xterm, which I can then start
the fvwm I've compiled from.  Any debugging messages fvwm prints then go
to the xterm.

The problem is that I don't think anyone is really currently maintaining
FvwmPager. I do think that every module should be that flexible
though. Another which comes to mind is FvwmButtons. It might be nice to be
able to make button 1 start up an application, and button 3 pop up a menu
which does things to the appropriate window (ie, button3 over my netscape icon 
would let me choose between uniconifying, raising, lowering, etc some/all of
my netscape windows; or maybe button 2 just toggles whether netscape is
iconified). 

I would be willing to volunteer to write up some code to do all this and stick 
it in fvwmlib after fvwm 2.1 is officially released. It would mostly involve
cleaning up FvwmIconMan code which I aim to clean anyway. I haven't
volunteered yet though.

I use the default MouseFocus, which is what I assume you mean by

Well the default WindowList action is to warp to the window after
Focusing and Raising the window, but it does not seem to be happening
correctly.  I do see the same thing you see -- that it does get the
focus for a while -- and I was trying to debug to see if the problem
was the menu code trying to put the mouse/focus back (somewhere) when
it was done or maybe something just not executing, but - alas - the
network went down right as I closed in on it.

Anyone have any info?

When I say debug, I mean line by line with a debugger through the
appropriate regions.  And if that region is something like do_menu,
where the focus is moved for a short time to pop up the menu, then I
lose focus on my gdb debugging window when the routine moves the focus
to the menu, pretty much killing the whole deal right there.  Can't
type (no focus!), can't refocus (no window manager!).  Need a dumb
terminal to allow things to work right.

I've heard one can "nest" window managers somehow to allow debugging
of one of them while the other kicks in to allow you to continue to
move about, but could not find info on it.  Anyone have some info on
how it's done by the pro's?

The fvwm/read.c file in fvwm-2.0.45 has a bug; it uses a
fixed-length buffer for the message that it passes to modules.
This breaks (buffer overflow) on long PixmapPaths or IconPaths.

The supplied patch fixes the function to dynamically allocate space.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

The Read functions in fvwm-2.0.45 has behavior that I find very
annoying; in a multi-user setup, it expects the *system-wide* RC file
to be named ".fvwm2rc", instead of "system.fvwm2rc", and complains
loudly if it can't find a file of that name.

(e.g, it says:
    [FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file '.fvwm2rc' not found in $HOME or /mit/windowmanagers/arch/sun4m_54/lib/X11/fvwm2
    [FVWM][Read]:  trying to read system rc file
)

This is inconsistent with the behavior of all traditional
windowmanagers that I am familiar with.  I modified the function
to cease emitting the warning messages.

Patch included.


Sincerely,

This is a simple enough matter dealt with briefly in the man page.
(you may have overlooked it). Just change the line in your .fvwmrc
(or equivalent) that reads

ColormapFocus	FollowsMouse

to the following

ColormapFocus	FollowsFocus  


and then restart.

I just tried this.  It doesn't work.  Is this a fvwm-2.x thing?

You people really don't give a guy a break, do you? Configurability is
naturally in the todo list. I thought the module's sketch needs to be
portraited before all the details. (Which reminds me that aspect-ratio is
still an open question)

Of course. Any ideas?

Is there any way to use this module as placement as well as movement?  I
dunno if this is even possible, or if Fvwm can handle it.

Also, make it possible to unmap the window once it has been selected for
movement/placement.  That way, you can see what is under it.

You mean as a module called whenever a window is mapped, as a replacement
for ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement etc? As far as I understood, I don't
think Fvwm supports this. (yet?)

!! Good idea. Splendid. Thanks.

This is what I do, and it's totally trivial... if you have the right
version of X :)

The newer X's (I think starting with X11R6 or X11R6.1) come with a
"nexting X server", called Xnest.  Look for it in your /usr/bin/X11.
If you don't have it, you'll need a new version of X11.

Check the man page, but you simply start it and tell it to display on
your real X server; it opens a window inside of which is a whole X
screen.  It creates a new display you can use with fvwm or whatever,
like "fvwm2 -display :1".

There may be other ways, but this is _far_ and away the simplest.

I'm sorry if I seem pushy. I'm just kinda teasing and wanting things to work
out well for this module. I just want to get my cents in before you decided on 
a particular method for configurability :-).

As for ideas, they tend to come straggling in over time as new people discover 
your module. It seems that each person has a quota of new ideas (even the
author), and after they start using the module, they will hopefully tell you
about them, and then you'll never hear from them again. That's why I was
pushing getting configurability in early, cause it puts you in a position
right off to "catch" these ideas.

I haven't had any new ideas lately (quota used up I guess). So I'll stick with 
smart resizing/placement, switching to new desks/pages, warping to preset
geometries (ie, hitting left arrow while resizing stretches the left side of
the window all the way to the left side of screen), and remembering past
confiurations for each window so I can cycle through them while rubberbanding.

Oh, here's a new one: I sometimes want to make a window have the same size as
another window. I like my xterms uniform for example. I don't think this would 
work with rubberbanding. All I'd want is a new cursor and after I click on the 
window to use as a reference - poof my other window gets resized. The way I
see this working is by fvwm passing an argument to the module (just like how
some modules take "transient") to tell it what it has to do.

Similar to this, it would be nice to be able to stick windows together and 
move them as a whole.  I suppose resizing might be nice too.  For example, one 
of the debuggers I use comes in two windows (one for commands and things, and 
one for process I/O); it would be nice to be able to move them as one.  I'm 
sure this has been discussed before...

Openwindows allows this.  I find it to be mostly useless, but it is nice
when you need it.

LeftMouse is used in the Title to move the window.  Click MiddleMouse, and
the windows border gets bolder.  Then, when you move, all the selected
windows move.

(About moving multiple windows together.)  You mean olvwm, I assume?  Yes, I 
agree, and it's the SparcWorks debugger that I'm talking about.  There aren't 
many applications I can think of where this would be useful, but just 
occasionally it would be, and it's surely the kind of thing a module could do?

Grouping might be nice for other things too: I might want to iconify a 
collection of windows, as well as moving them.  I'm thinking of Netscape and 
its bookmarks window, or something like that.

I was thinking of something like the Mac Apple Menu.  All windows register
a class.  You could iconify/whatever all Netscape/Xterm/Xv/... windows at
once.  That would be really useful.

 This is not a window manager issue; it's the way xterm
and its descendants work. If you're trying to capture the output
of a simple command line utility like, say, ps, and you're not
getting line wrap, the saved lines in the buffer are truncated
at the window border. This works the same under mwm, twm, or any
other wm. Resize the window to a greater width, and you'll see
that there's nothing there to scroll to. (If you want to get really annoyed,
shrink the window to something narrower than the original size,
then stretch it again and see what xterm has done.)

 Think about what "restart" means for a moment. It
doesn't mean "restore my current state" (a meaningless
concept: I'm already *in* my current state); it means
"reset your state to a predictable set of *initial*
values". Ergo, it's not reasonable to expect that some
things will not get reset.

 Only those windows for which you specified a
StartsOnDesk style. Fvwm initialization attempts to capture
all the information it can about the state of existing
windows, then applies whatever initial style information
you specified in your fvwm2rc.

 That said, we often want the unreasonable, and
it's inconvenient to lose parts of your current state if you just
wanted to restart after, say, adding a new menu item to your
fvwm2rc. There is a SaveDesktop feature that uses a module
to save as much info as it can about your current desktop
state in a secondary rc file that fvwm can read at startup/restart.
I never use it, so I can't speak to its effectiveness, but you
might want to look into that. Perhaps someone else can
comment on how useful it might be.


 Cheers,
 Bob

Hi everybody,

I' m asking a help cos I have a little problem to solve.

I' m currently working with a workstation SGI indigo 2 running Irix 5.3
using the fvwm. I have two monitors connected.

I just want to be able to tranfer a window on my machine from the display
falco:0.0 to falco:0.1.

Does anybody now how to do it ?

Thanks.

Massimo.

You cannot.  There is no general way to move windows from one display to
another.  This is almost equivalent to moving a window from host1:0 to
host2:0, it can't be done.  (I wish that it could, my Ultra has 2 heads.)

You would have to change the Display pointer in the X program, reconnect
to the display, re-load all the fonts, possibly change visuals and depths,
and so forth.

It is possible to write a client that can do this, e.g. xemacs.  The
make-frame-other-display function can do this.  I have also seen patches
for Xnest that allow Xnest to connect to 2 displays, giving you 1 large
virtual desktop across 2 monitors.  There is a huge speed and memory
penalty, and I don't even remember where the patches are.

If it were to be done, it would have to be done on the server level, not
the window manager level.

Are you sure?  The code is do_windowList in windows.c.  It seems that the
stock action is to to call RAISE_IT on the window, which doesn't warp the
pointer.  This is in fvwm 2.0.43, I haven't upgraded for a while.  I think
I added code so it would warp to the window if you were using pointer focus,
but I can't quite remember what I did exactly.  When I get home from work
today I'll check my code.

It must have changed.  While the code is in do_windowlist, once it
returns it executes WindowListFunc (windowlistfunc) on the window.
>From the 2.0.45 manpage:

     WindowList [options]
          Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in  which  the
          title  and geometry of each of the windows currently on
          the desk top are shown.  The geometry of iconified win-
          dows  is  shown in parenthesis.  Selecting an item from
          the window list pop-up menu will by default  cause  the
          interpreted  function WindowListFunc to be run with the
          window id of that window passed in as $0.   By  default
          the WindowListFunc looks like this:
 
               AddToFunc WindowListFunc "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
               +                        "I" WindowId $0 Focus
               +                        "I" WindowId $0 Raise
               +                        "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p
 
          You can Destroy the builtin WindowListFunc  and  create
          your own if these defaults do not suit you.
	  ...

In tracing the action, I did see these occur in this order (up to the
warp, when the network went to dinner).

The comp.windows.x FAQ tells about "xmove", which is "a pseudoserver (aka
proxy server) which allows you to dynamically move an X application
between servers, and screens within a server." The v2 beta seems to date
to Augost. ftp site: ftp.cs.columbia.edu:/pub/xmove. I have of course no
idea about performance.

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/x-faq/part6/faq-doc-4.html
is the faq answer with several other programs.

Good morning,

	Is there any way to know when fvwm is 'busy' and when it's 'idle'.
Suppose I want to display a rubberband over the screen. If I want fvwm to
iconify a window, I'll need to hide the rubberband while it does it, and
redisplay it after it's done. Currently I have there a 
sleep_a_little(150000) which is almost too slow to be bareable, but this
is obviously not the best solution. The problem is that I paint the
rubberband with XDrawRectangle directly over root, and not in a window of
itself, ergo problems with window which overlap.

Fvwm really needs the ability to do synchronization with modules in this
fashion. I had similar problems with FvwmIconMan when the user would use fvwm
to move my icon manager window. This is a complicated problem. My hope is that
after fvwm2 is officially released we can redo the module interface to allow
for tighter integration on such things.

None of that helps you though. I gather that your problem is just that while
rubberbanding, you send a command to fvwm to unmap a window. It's not that
fvwm is doing other things behind your back.

If so, then it shouldn't be too hard to add a new message type to handle
this. When a module sends a command to fvwm to execute, fvwm sends back a
packet when that command is completed. It seems that we would just have to
send that message back after the call to ExecuteFunction() in
HandleModuleInput() in module.c. Wouldn't be hard at all. And since your
module would be the only one using it for now, it shouldn't be a risky thing
to add.

It seems a reasonable thing to add. If a module wants fvwm to do something, it
should be able to know when it's done.

Now if you are worried about fvwm doing things that your module has no way of
knowing about, the only way to cleanly handle that is to add semaphores to
fvwm. The odds of that happening are probably fairly slim, and easily
controlled by the user (I quit netscape, which takes 20 seconds to actually
quit, and in the meantime start resizing windows. I should just know better).

Just a small request... How about the ability to choose a window and then
send it to a new display? Is it feasible :)

I'm a new user to fvwm, and I'm having a slight problem installing it.
I looked at configure.h, but I didn't know what most of the things in
there were for so I didn't change anything. It didn't appear to contain
anything about where fvwm would be installed to though. Next I went to
Fvwm.tmpl, and I changed FvwmBinDir, FvwmLibDir, and FvwmDir to point
to /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2. When I compiled, I didn't get anything there
except fvwmrc_convert, quantize_pixmaps, and system.fvwmrc. I searched
around my system and I can't find the fvwm2 binaries anywhere, and I
looked through Fvwm.tmpl, Imakefile, and configure.h and I couldn't
find any more variables that appear to point to installation directories.
What am I missing?

Not *really*....you could find out (like FvwmSaveDesk) the invocation
parameters of the program, kill the current one and restart it on the
new display.  But moving somethign without killing it is hard with
most X servers.

I remember reading about an X server called Xmove that lets you do
this sort of thing, but also remember reading that it wasn't quite
perfect.  Perhaps it's better now ?  If so, i'd love to hear about it
:)

I did figure out that my output when I type 'make install' periodically
includes text like the following:

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../libs/libfvwm2.a', needed by
'fvwm2'.  Stop.

I get a similar error message for all the modules (I think) as well as
fvwm2, which I guess explains why none of the binaries are being installed
to the directories I'm pointing at like I explained in my previous
message. If anyone can tell me what this is all about and how I might go
about fixing it, I'd be eternally grateful. =)

BTW, I'm installing on Linux 2.0.0. I'm not sure what version of XFree86
I'm using, and I'm not sure how to find out.. but it's the version that
came with the Slackware release if that helps any.

Good morning,

And how did you deal with it? (Or /where/ did you deal with it? I couldn't
find it in IconMan sources.)

Apparantly, someone already did it. At least in my fvwm2-95 v2.0.42a,
HandleModuleInput() ends like that:

      ExecuteFunction(text,tmp_win,&Event,Context ,channel); 
      SendPacket(channel,M_FUNCTION_END,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0);

and module.h states:

#define M_FUNCTION_END       (1<<22)

And it even works (providing you take into accout the M_FUNCTION_END
following the M_CONFIG_END. So much for today's hard work). Thanks.

Absolutely. That's why there's a "refresh screen" a mousedrag away. :-)

Howdy all.

Just a quick note to let you know that the next beta, 2.0.46, is
finially available.  I've just uploaded it to ftp.hpc.uh.edu:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      309199 Aug 20 09:33 fvwm-2.0.45-to-2.0.46.patch.gz
-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      806706 Aug 20 09:33 fvwm-2.0.46.tar.gz

The patch is untested, but should work ok, I think.

It (like usual) doesn't have all of stuff in there that I really
wanted to get in there, but it was taking way too long to get out.

So if your favorite patch isn't in there, it may still appear in the
not too distant future.  Namely, I expect a lot of gripes about the
absence of the animated menu patch and the colorlimit patch - some
variation of both of these will most likely appear in 2.0.47.

Here's the ChangeLog entry:

======================================================================
2.0.46
       1. Patch to remove forgotten CLICKTORAISE #if check, from
          Markus Gutschke
       2. More mini xpm files
       3. Fix to XTerm font change problem
       4. There is no 4...
       5. Updated extras/FvwmScript from Frederic Cordier
       6. Changing default XORValue to 0, which now means "try and
          guess what a good XORValue is for my display" (using recommended
          method in the XLib Programming Manual)
       7. Updated FvwmM4 & Cpp man pages to show correct invocation...
       8. Updated extras/fvwmperl from Dan Astoorian
       9. FAQ updates
       10. Imakefile fixes
       11. Added info to FvwmIdent (transient)
       12. Brought back 1.xx like CursorStyle command (based on old
           patch from Kit Smithers)
       13. Patch from Patrice Fortier to allow xpm backgrounds in
           FvwmButtons (noticed some problems with this)
       14. Updated FvwmCommand from Toshi Isogai
       15. Builtin WinList fixes (geometry string makes more sense now,
           plus alphabetic sort option from Eric Schott)
       16. Fix from Andrew for NoButton 0 problem
       17. GetDecor SCO CPP patch from Andrew
       18. Patch from Andrew for MWM buttons functions problems
       19. Fix from Dave Goldberg for NoTitle & MiniIcon conflict
       20. Move/Resize frame drawing bug patch from Makoto Matsushita
       21. Patch to FlipFocus (under MouseFocus) from Markus Gutschke
       22. Added patch from Rob Whapham/Thimo Jansen for FvwmPager
           miniicons (plus small enhancements)
       23. FvwmBacker patch from Tim Phipps to have it run fvwm
           commands instead of unix commands, so borders & the like
           can be changed too (just use Exec to get old functionality)
       24. Latest FvwmIconMan (v1.0) from Brady Montz
       25. Fix for static buffer overflow in SendDataToModule in read.c
           (when IconPath/PixmapPath greater than 255 chars)
       26. Patch from Tim Phipps to add Current op (like Prev & Next,

       28. Added FvwmTaskBar to extras dir (ported from fvwm95 by Don Mahurin)
       29. Added FvwmWinList miniicons patch from Don Mahurin.  Still

       30. Patches from Randy Ray to make windowshade module packets
           more "standard" & add filename to MINI_ICON packet
       31. Patch from Barry Warsaw to make multi head code work
           slightly better (although it probably needs a total rewrite
           to really work well - ctwm good model?)
       32. Patch to echo builtin needs to remove final \n if there is
           one (Greg Badros sees this, but I don't so it might be a system
           dependent bug)
       33. Patch from Dan Espen for keeping long icon names on screen
       34. Made builtin function searching faster (hopefully) using
           simple binary search (mostly to help speed up startup
           time).  Please let me know how this works since my
           relatively simple setup isn't a good test case for this...
       35. Removed 'raise_it' entirely, since no longer used
       36. Made window move paging match Edgescroll values instead of
           always doing full screens (should this be an option?)
       37. Focus command no longer raises - use an interpreted
           focus-and-raise function if that's desired
       38. Minor menu code bug fixed - wasn't always ungrabbing the
           cursor before executing function (timing dependent - most
           of the time ok)
       39. Fixes for DEC Alpha compile warnings
       40. Fix for IconBox -0 handling, from Ric Lister

Howdy all.

Just a quick note to let you know that the next beta, 2.0.46, is
finially available.  I've just uploaded it to ftp.hpc.uh.edu:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      309199 Aug 20 09:33 fvwm-2.0.45-to-2.0.46.patch.gz
-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      806706 Aug 20 09:33 fvwm-2.0.46.tar.gz

The patch is untested, but should work ok, I think.

It (like usual) doesn't have all of stuff in there that I really
wanted to get in there, but it was taking way too long to get out.

So if your favorite patch isn't in there, it may still appear in the
not too distant future.  Namely, I expect a lot of gripes about the
absence of the animated menu patch and the colorlimit patch - some
variation of both of these will most likely appear in 2.0.47.

Here's the ChangeLog entry:

======================================================================
2.0.46
       1. Patch to remove forgotten CLICKTORAISE #if check, from
          Markus Gutschke
       2. More mini xpm files
       3. Fix to XTerm font change problem
       4. There is no 4...
       5. Updated extras/FvwmScript from Frederic Cordier
       6. Changing default XORValue to 0, which now means "try and
          guess what a good XORValue is for my display" (using recommended
          method in the XLib Programming Manual)
       7. Updated FvwmM4 & Cpp man pages to show correct invocation...
       8. Updated extras/fvwmperl from Dan Astoorian
       9. FAQ updates
       10. Imakefile fixes
       11. Added info to FvwmIdent (transient)
       12. Brought back 1.xx like CursorStyle command (based on old
           patch from Kit Smithers)
       13. Patch from Patrice Fortier to allow xpm backgrounds in
           FvwmButtons (noticed some problems with this)
       14. Updated FvwmCommand from Toshi Isogai
       15. Builtin WinList fixes (geometry string makes more sense now,
           plus alphabetic sort option from Eric Schott)
       16. Fix from Andrew for NoButton 0 problem
       17. GetDecor SCO CPP patch from Andrew
       18. Patch from Andrew for MWM buttons functions problems
       19. Fix from Dave Goldberg for NoTitle & MiniIcon conflict
       20. Move/Resize frame drawing bug patch from Makoto Matsushita
       21. Patch to FlipFocus (under MouseFocus) from Markus Gutschke
       22. Added patch from Rob Whapham/Thimo Jansen for FvwmPager
           miniicons (plus small enhancements)
       23. FvwmBacker patch from Tim Phipps to have it run fvwm
           commands instead of unix commands, so borders & the like
           can be changed too (just use Exec to get old functionality)
       24. Latest FvwmIconMan (v1.0) from Brady Montz
       25. Fix for static buffer overflow in SendDataToModule in read.c
           (when IconPath/PixmapPath greater than 255 chars)
       26. Patch from Tim Phipps to add Current op (like Prev & Next,
           but operates only on Current window) and enhanced conditionals
           for Prev/Next/Current/None (like the addition of !<name>)
       27. Added FvwmWharf to extras dir (ported from AfterStep by who??)
       28. Added FvwmTaskBar to extras dir (ported from fvwm95 by Don Mahurin)
       29. Added FvwmWinList miniicons patch from Don Mahurin.  Still
           need to update docs for it...
       30. Patches from Randy Ray to make windowshade module packets
           more "standard" & add filename to MINI_ICON packet
       31. Patch from Barry Warsaw to make multi head code work
           slightly better (although it probably needs a total rewrite
           to really work well - ctwm good model?)
       32. Patch to echo builtin needs to remove final \n if there is
           one (Greg Badros sees this, but I don't so it might be a system
           dependent bug)
       33. Patch from Dan Espen for keeping long icon names on screen
       34. Made builtin function searching faster (hopefully) using
           simple binary search (mostly to help speed up startup
           time).  Please let me know how this works since my
           relatively simple setup isn't a good test case for this...
       35. Removed 'raise_it' entirely, since no longer used
       36. Made window move paging match Edgescroll values instead of
           always doing full screens (should this be an option?)
       37. Focus command no longer raises - use an interpreted
           focus-and-raise function if that's desired
       38. Minor menu code bug fixed - wasn't always ungrabbing the
           cursor before executing function (timing dependent - most
           of the time ok)
       39. Fixes for DEC Alpha compile warnings
       40. Fix for IconBox -0 handling, from Ric Lister
======================================================================

My thanks again to the folks on the workers list for helping flush out
last minute bugs, and to everyone for patches, suggestions, and your
(continued) patience with my not too timely releases...

Enjoy,
Chuck

Hi Guys,  

I'm trying to implement keyboard shortcuts to work with 
fvwm so that CDE's feel comes to my desktop (without
the look).  
I have encounter several problems trying to achieve this. 
Would you be able to help me with that? (Sorry, no news 
server running around here, cannot look for a newsgroup.)
Here are the problems:

  1 - When CirculatingUp or Down, I would like to restrict
	the list to the current page on the Pager.  How?

  2 - When pressing M+space, the WindowOps menu should 
	appear on the left upper corner (where the respective
	button is).  At the moment, it pops up where the cursor is,
	even if that means outside the current active window.

  3 - FvwmButtons is insensitive to the keyboard.  I would like to 
	navigate through it as if it were a menu bar (which it is,
	in a sense), and then have it respond to "return" as the
	mouse's button 1.

  4 - There's something else I forgot, but I shall remember by the 
	time your answers have landed on my desk.

Thanks,  

Werner

Wonderful!  Thanks for all the hard work on it.

I'm sorry I have to start complaining now.

No comment.

#> 2.0.46

There has been a big change in the menu popup code.  The only annoying
problem I have with it is keyboard control of menus.  In v.45, when a
menu was popped up with the keyboard, you could go to a submenu by
pressing right, but now it seems you need to emulate moving the mouse
and have to press right several times to move the mouse a little by a
little until you are far enough to the right to activate the menu.

This is much slower and seems like needless typing.  What was the
reason for modifying the menu action like this?  Are we assuming
people will be using letter shortcuts instead of pressing right/left?
I would need to add these to all the menus now...is it possible to get
a way to emulate the old method?

I'm trying to reduce the number of colors Fvwm2 hogs on my 256 color display.
I'm already reducing the colors in my pixmaps to a standard color map.  But I
noticed that even though my FvwmButtons and all of my menus have the same
background, and theoretically the same highlight and shadow, the menus are
currently missing their highlights and shadows!  This changes with every restart
as I change things around, but why don't they use the same color cell?  Just
what is the organization behind Fvwm's color usage.  Do the modules share any of
those colors?  Is there anything I can do to correct this?  I thought simply
usng the same color names and valus thrught my fvwm and module configurations
that they wouldshare, but seemingly, this is not true.

Brian.

I removed an option which a lot of people liked (where it unmapped itself when 
empty). That resulted in removing all the ugly attempts at fixing the
problem. My particular problem was a race condition which led to FvwmIconMan
no knowing where it was on the screen correctly.

Well, looks like we should add that to fvwm then.

The menus relief and shadow are computed in fvwm/colors.c
FvwmButtons reief and shadow are computed in modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c

The calculation of the relief seems to be the same, but I am
not sure about the rounding on the highlight:

((rgb/50)/100) vs. rgb>>1

If XPM is defined, "FvwmButtons.c" uses the  XPM library to allocate a
"close" color, where colors.c  uses XAllocColor.  Providing the  exact
color is available they should both be able to share a color cell.

>From the symptom you describe, I would have to guess that you were out
of color at  the time fvwm  tried to get the color  it needed for  the
menu.

Sure would be nice if all this calculation was in one place...

Hi Charles and everyone else,

A typo in my filter sent a "don't spam me" spam-reply to the list. I fixed the
problem so it shouldn't happen again. I apologize for the inconvenience. And
I'd also like to thank all the list users who kindfully refrained from
mail-bombing me. ;-) Unless I just haven't received the bombs yet.

Laurent Duperval.

P.S. I hope I wasn't automatically removed from the announcements list...

Here's a bug that's been a mild annoyance to me for a while; I
mentioned it when 2.0.44 came out, but it still seems to be there in
2.0.46....

I use FvwmButtons, with this line included in the configuration:

    *FvwmButtons Restart icon.xpm     Restart fvwm2

...but whenever I use the button, a warning message is produced:

    [FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2
    ' failed!!!!

When FvwmButtons sends commands to fvwm2, it includes the trailing
newline, and fvwm2 isn't parsing it out, so it tries to start a command
named "fvwm2\n".

This would particularly be a problem if one wanted to start a different
window manager from FvwmButtons, since there's no way to get FvwmButtons
to suppress the newline, and as it stands, no way to get fvwm2 to ignore
it.

Would it break anything if restart_function() were changed to parse out
the first word after the command?  I.e., change:

    void restart_function(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
			  unsigned long context, char *action, int *Module)
    {
      Done(1, action);
    }

to something along the lines of:

    void restart_function(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
			  unsigned long context, char *action, int *Module)
    {
      char *arg=NULL;

      action = GetNextToken(action,&arg);
      if (!(arg && *arg)) arg="fvwm2";
      Done(1, arg);
    }

Comments?  (Chuck, could this be fixed in 2.0.47?)

Thanks,

Please fix either the code or documentation for FvwmScroll.

The patch I included fixed the code in one place and the documentation
in three.  In the 2.0.46 release, one of the documentation files has
been fixed, but the other two and the code remain broken.  I have
updated my patch to fix these three items.  Please apply it!

fvwm'ers


More and more these days we are crashing up against the problem of
colour table limitation.   Virtual window managers are great at
encouraging our users to have multiple screens with many open
applications.   Can anyone see a way to have fvwm manage the colour
table on a 'per screen' basis; ie saving the current table and restoring
an alternate version as screens are changed?   It's a tall order I know
but any ideas/comments?

I have downloaded fvwm-2.0.46.tar.gz twice (to ensure I didn't have any
transmission errors), and every time I try to extract it I get the
following
error:

hfmngxs@sed_sparc8$ tar -xf fvwm-2.0.46.tar
tar: read error: unexpected EOF

I have the following setup:

hfmngxs@sed_sparc8$ bash -version
GNU bash, version 2.00.0(10)-release (sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3)
Copyright 1996 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

hfmngxs@sed_sparc8$ gzip -V

Compilation options:
DIRENT UTIME HAVE_UNISTD_H 

hfmngxs@sed_sparc8$ uname -a
SunOS sed_sparc 4.1.4 1 sun4m


I have not had any problems with V2.0.45 - what's happened? Has some
souped up version of 'tar' been used? I can't get any version info
from 'tar', all I get is:

hfmngxs@sed_sparc8$ tar -v
tar: usage: tar -{ctxru}[vfblmhopwBiX] [tapefile] [blocksize] file1

Hope someone can help me!!

Cheers,

Well, I compiled it with absolutely no problems (which I always find
much better) and it works fine so far. I already had the FvwmButtons
Pixmap patch so the change was fairly transparent. 

However I've been mucking about with the Wharf Module now and I have
to say I love it!Talk about cool. 

Only one gripe and that's that Close doesn't work on it, and Destroy
gets rid of the window but then the module goes zombie and hammers the
cpu. I'm running this on a Sun UltraSparc 1 with Solaris 2.5.1.

I was thinking about his.  I believe it owuld be useful to have a tool, similar
to 'xcolor' (a mosaic of all f the colors in the colormap) that when a color is
clicked, it would cycle that color through an eye catching predetermined
pattern, showing outisde of its window where that color had been used.  For
example, blicking on 'black' and all of the text in the Fvwm Menus and
ButtonBars, etc, would cycle colors indicating that they are e all using the
same color cell.  Is anything liek this available?  I'm going ot go out on a
limb and say this would be easy to write, even thoguh I have very limited X
experience in relation to colormaps.

If by screens, you mean the desktops controlled by the pager, then this question
is in the FVWM FAQ:  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/FAQ.html

Here is the excerpt for your question/idea:


30) Will FVWM ever support a separate colormap for each desktop?

A: Doubtful, althougth I'd like to see it too.  I believe that it'd be
   possible to change the default colormap whenever you switch desks,
   which would give programs started when that desk is active that
   colormap, how would you deal with windows being moved across desks?

   Plus fvwm itself needs certain colormap entries for all of it's
   drawing (borders, menus, etc), so these colors would have to be
   pre-allocated in all of the colormaps, or something like that.

   While this all *might* be technically possible, I don't feel that
   it's really feasable right now (too much code bloat and
   complexity), especially since most color hog programs (ie Netscape)
   allow you to have them install private colormaps.

   I may explore this a little at some point in the future though.

I think someone at oine point also mentioned that it becomes a little
complicated for a window that spans more than one desktop (i.e., itis past the
edge, or it is two screens wide, etc.)

I think it the ideal solution is to have certain classes of windows share the
same colormap.  For example, all xterms use one map, xv another, etc...  but
still allow for private color maps.  And in addition, some smart color
allocation with the X server would make things much nicer.  I think a very
simple algorithm would be when allocating a color in a  private map, place it in
the cell that is the closest match in the other colormaps (or a standard, base
color map).  This would limit flashing.

I'd also like to mention the possibility of emulating a 24-bit x server on 256
color displays.  Use some osrt of dithering algorithm.  Use a reperating pattern
for each color that every pixel is mapped from.  Or alternatively, when a new
color needs to be allocated andno room is available, find the closest cooor,
average it with the new one, and let it use that color cell.  If you stard with
a wide-spread color spectrum for a colormap, this works out nicely.  I used a
similar algorithm to reduce all of my pixmaps to the same 128 colors.

Brian.

Its already been  written and works  remarkably like you  describe.  I
have a copy, and  the comments indicate  the author is  Barry Solomon.
The program is called  "colormap".  I've had  trouble re-finding it on
the net, if  someone can find  it, let me know  where it is, as I have
some minor enhancements I'd like to give back to the author.

Is it possible to reposition FvwmButtons?  I've tried something like Next
[FvwmButtons] Move 10p 10p (when it started at 0p 0p), but it didn't seem to
work.  Does Sticky or StaysOnTop affect this?  Or is this even possible?

Brian.

This is a bug which I found on the last release.
basically FvwmButtons won't accept a colour in

#??????  format because of the #  it does some 
unnecessary string processing looking for #'s
when it only has to search for a # at a beginning
of a line.

A patch to fix this is below (sorry if this is wrong 
I'm not too sure about patches yet)

apply as 

patch fvwm-2.0.46/modules/FvwmButtons/parse.c <name of this patch file>

I don't think this is right. It works fine for me on both 2.0.45 and 46.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


I just built fvwm-2.0.46 on on a SGI O2 with a compiler that does extensive
code checking and found a HUGE number of warnings, variable usage remarks,
and one critical error.  Since the build log is almost 200k (uncompressed)
I am not going to post it here.  If you maintain any of the "default"
modules you probabaly want to get a copy of this.  I am going to send a
copy directly to Chuck Hines.   If you want a copy of it please contact me
and I will get you a copy of it.

The most important bug is that the type of PPosOverride in fvwm.c is
defined as a Boolean which is #defined to be an int and in events.c,
misc.c, and placement.c it is defined as a extern Bool.   Changing the
declaration in fvwm.c fixed the problem.

Another source of warnings is that libs/Imakefile does not define
FVWM_SRCDIR.

Did you, by any chance, use ftp and forgot to set the mode to binary mode?

The command is "bin" on the ftp prompt.

        I wouldn't recommend changing the restart function to compensate for
a bug in the FvwmButtons interface (if that were the case): that would be 
degrading code that's working nicely instead of fixing what's broken.

        However, I think that if you try something along the following lines 
you'll be more than satisfied with the result:

       *FvwmButtons(Title Restart, Icon icon.xpm, Action "Restart fvwm2")

or whatever your Favorite Virtuous Window Manager is called.


        Cheers,
        Bob

I just downloaded the newer version of fvwm (keep 'em coming :-) and noticed
the following couple of things.

Pertaining to FvwmWinList:

The text is now left-justified (no Icons or anything fancy, just window
titles - it used to be centered); the man pages says default justification
is center (I think), is that not the case ?

(from FvwmWinList.man)

     *FvwmWinListLeftJustify
          By default, FvwmWinList will center the  icon  text  in
          the  icon.  This option causes it to be justified flush
          with the left edge of the icon.

I also noticed that the buttons get pressed (ie. they sink) when the window
gets focus, is there any way to turn that off (didn't happen on 2.0.45)

Here are my relevant entries from ~/.fvwm2rc


# FvwmWinList

Well, I still think it's a bug, if for no other reason than that its
behaviour seems inconsistent with the way other FVWM commands work; for
example,
    Restart twm

works, while
    Restart "twm"

tries to run an executable with quotes in its name.  Moreover, I can't
think of any practical case where *not* parsing produces more desirable
behaviour than parsing (ask yourself: is it *reasonable* for fvwm2 to
try to exec command names with embedded newlines, spaces, or quotes?)

Granted, modules probably shouldn't be sending commands with newlines
embedded in them, and it's not specifically documented what fvwm2 should
do when that happens.  Personally, I think it would be a good thing in
theory if packets from modules were treated as small .fvwm2rc files;
this would allow multiple commands to be sent in a single packet by
separating them with newlines.  However, I haven't looked into how much
effort it would take to implement this.

Anyways, just my $0.02.

Thanks for the workaround.  (In case it's not obvious, my configuration
for FvwmButtons was derived from my configuration for fvwm-1.24's
GoodStuff module, before this syntax was introduced.)

this is just a thought I had last night (it may be really stupid!!!)

would it be possible to put all xpm icons in one file in a format that
fvwm would find easier and faster to access, as sort of cache. this could
be compressed so that the icons took up less room (or are these 2 points
a contradiction)

then the icons could be accessed by a small archiver program that would
add and subtract icons and ensure that they all shared the same colour map.

as it is right now, xpm's work for most of us, but having them in this format
makes it more difficult for casual users to change their setup.

one possbile advantage of this system would be to take naming inconsistancies
between icons and mini icons away correlating them. this may also help any
config program.

any comments???

Graeme

p.s. I found a bug (I think) in FvwmButtons

I'm running solaris 2.5 with fvwm 2.0.46 and X11R5

the line in my setup, in an fvwmbuttons file, that doesn't work is

Back            #30c8c8


if anyone else has this problem could you please tell me. I posted a patch
yesterday, however some people don't seem to be affected by the bug and I 
would like to know exactly how it occurs

What format were you thinking of?  Given that fvwm uses the xpm library, xpm 
format is about as convenient as it can get!  Another point against this is 
that it's convenient to be able to use standard tools to fiddle with the 
pixmaps, and standard tools aren't going to understand a nonstandard format.

Having said that, I don't see a problem with your other suggestion, of 
allowing a program to provide pixmaps.  Users could provide an PixmapProgram 
or something, which would be executed with the PixmapPath and the desired 
pixmap name, and would either return an EOF immediately (indicating that no 
such pixmap is available) or print the desired pixmap to standard output.  
Maybe an error status would be better for indicating no pixmap.

That would allow you to store pixmaps however you wanted, so long as you could 
turn them into xpm format (presumably you'd want to be able to do this 
reasonably quickly, too, although that would mostly be a startup cost).  If 
you wanted, you could throw in a quantize to reduced colourmap or whatever.  
You could check the name of the pixmap, and if it didn't exist, but stripping 
off a leading "mini-" did, you could reduce the pixmap's size on the fly.  All 
kinds of things would be possible.  If starting up the process costs too much, 
the whole thing could be stuck in a module, I suppose (although I'd guess 
you'd have to extend the module interface a little).

Well, I seem to have solved that problem.  My "Fvwm*" style command was setting
the SkipCirculate flag, so my Next [FvwmButtons] Move 10p 10p was not
circulating to that window.

Now, however, when I DO move the window, my mouse cursor is turned into that
focusless dot and I have to click something to regain control.  What causes this
and how can I fix it?

Brian.

As far as sharing a single colormap, I feel your pain.  I wrote a combination C
program and perl script to process my pixmaps to a standard colormap.  I simply
generated a complete color spectrum to the reoslution of 128 colors, and
openened each pixmap, found the closest shade in the new spectrum to the one in
the pixmap and replaced it.  I did this on my original 24 bit pixmaps rather
than the 8 bit dithered ones.  The results have been VERY impressive (IMHO).
I'm not so sure this freed up my colormap as other programs sucked it up when
they saw the psace, but that's another story.

P.S. As for your bug.  If your FvwmButtons configuration lines are in the
.fvwm2rc, I believe that the line is ignored because it sees that # as a comment
starter.  Try quoting the color value to see if it fixes your problem:

Back    "#30c8c8"

If this doesn't work, try some other forms of expressing color, such as:
decimal, colorname (you can look in the color anme table and find the closest
match).

Brian.

There  already is some form  of caching of pixmaps  in fvwm2.  See the
routine "libs/Picture.c:CachePicture()".

The XPM library allows the  XPM file to be  compressed.  When you tell
it  the  icon is "icon.xpm" it  also  searches for "icon.xpm.gz".  The
icon is held in memory in another format altogether.

There is a  patch that is  scheduled for  2.0.47  that will force  all
icons and other XPM decorations  to use the same set  of colors.  (The
colorlimiting patch.)  This should achieve what you want.

I am having a problem getting the pixmaps to react to justify based
on the Left, Right, Top, Bottom flags on ButtonStyle. The section
of my fvwm2rc is as follows:

ButtonStyle 2 (Solid LightGray -- Flat)
AddButtonStyle 2 Inactive (Solid DimGray)
AddButtonStyle 2 Pixmap win95_TB_close2.xpm -- Top Right
ButtonStyle 4 (Solid LightGray -- Flat)
AddButtonStyle 4 Inactive (Solid DimGray)
AddButtonStyle 4 Pixmap win95_TB_up2.xpm -- left
ButtonStyle 6 (Solid LightGray -- Flat Right)
AddButtonStyle 6 Inactive (Solid DimGray)
AddButtonStyle 6 (Pixmap win95_TB_down2.xpm -- right)

Do I have the syntax correct? I have testing the pixmap flags
by changing the underlying solid colors, and they stay put in
the default centered position. Is this a bug or am I using the
wrong syntax?
Thanks!!

A simple suggestion for those, like me, who compile FVWM
for personal use only. Note that I've no idea about
syntax etc, I'm making a general suggestion.

Could we have a line in the Fvwm.tmpl file like:

#define USER_DIR = /home/dcjk/

Allowing something like 
#ifdef USER_DIR
#define FvwmBinDir $USER_DIR/bin
#define FvwmDir    $USER_DIR/bin/modules
etc
else
normal default setup for system wide installation.

Then I wouldn't have to define the same path over and over...
and I always spell one of them wrongly!

Sounds like Dave.. 

But seriously folks.. He's got a point. But isn't it planned to switch
to GNU autoconf??? If this is done properly, we can run it with 

configure --prefix /home/imc

and it'll do all that automagically..

would it be possible to store all the xpms in this memory format so that
they are simply loaded straight into the program with as little processing
as possible?

I dunno. I've compiled all sorts of stuff using different methods.
xmkmf, configure etc.. and the ones using autoconfigure (xlockmore for
example) always have the option to set this on the command line.
I assume that this sort of set up is fairly standard, but I've only
ever compiled stuff not set things up to be compiled. I hope that made
sense? I'm not convinced I'm being coherent today....

is it possible to use wildcards with the DestoryMenu function so
that I can wipe all of my menu's and start again without having to
name them all?

if not is this easy to fix??

I just downloaded fvwm2.0.46 to my workstation, running HP-UX 10.20.
When I do MakeMakefiles (after xmkmf) I get the following error:

Can anyone tell me how to make this work? I had no such problem with

No.  The formats I was  referring to involve  the  use of pointers  to
memory locations.

What is the problem  you  are trying to solve?    I don't  notice  any
performance problems with XPM access.  (Even on my 25mhz Sparc 1+ home
machine.)

It shouldn't be too bad.  I'll look into it for 2.0.47.

Yes, as long as they're written correctly.  This one of the most
fundamental parts of autoconf, I don't think I've ever seen a package
using autoconf that didn't support this.

  -> ie does the above command automatically tell it to install in
  -> /home/imc/whatever rather than /usr/local/whatever

The configure script converts a file called Makefile.in to Makefile by
substituting various values, including the prefix, into the makefile.

So, as long as your Makefile.in is written in the standard autoconf way,
using the standard make variables to install into like $(bindir),
etc. it all just magically works.

I strongly suggest using autoconf and the new automake.  I've just
converted GNU make to use automake and it's really cool.  It allows a
very minimal amount of work on the part of the maintainer (once it's set
up :), and gives you an ironclad consistent interface for all your make
rules, etc.  It handles subdirectories, builds distributions in a
standard way, etc. etc.

You can also use libtool, which allows you to build shared libraries on
all kinds of different systems without doing _any_ special
system-specific setup.  If you've ever tried to implement support for
building shared libraries across the myriad UNIX systems there are
today, you'll really appreciate libtool.

Autoconf/automake/libtool beats the _pants_ off of xmkmf/Imakefiles,
there is absolutely no question about it.

FWIW, there is an error in the tar file, but most tar's can deal with

(i.e., the files are extracted as GNU tar and sun-solaris-2.5 extracts
them, but they don't issue any warnings).

star is a 100% POSIX compliant version of tar.

As a related note, I have been thinking about hacking Xpm library a
little, so it would handle better with small colormaps (that is 8 bit
displays). 

The basic idea would be to have some value of "colormap fullness",
which libXpm would determine before allocating a new color. It would
then scan the current colormap and find the closest color match. Next,
based on the "fullness" value it would either re-use the closest found
color or choose to allocate a new cell from the colormap.

The effect would be something like that as the colormap gets more and
more crowded Xpm would accept "less close" colors than with an empty
colormap, until at some threshold value it wouldn't allocate any new
color cells and would re-use existing, no matter how "far" the "best"
color match would be. (You could leave something like 64 colors not to
be allocate by Xpm, so there would then be some cells free for random
applications.)

If you started with pre-allocated colormap portion (with xstdcmap -all) 
then Xpm would prefer to choose colors from the pre-allocated colormap 
portion before trying to allocate its own.. even better.

I have not had the time to pursue the idea, so if anyone would like to 
do something similar, feel free to do so.

ImageMagick can take a series of images in any format, and reduce them all
to one color map.  The only drawback is that it is a memory hog.  I have
often run ImageMagick jobs that exceeded 200 megs.  But it only has to be
done once, and the jobs are only huge if you have a lot of images.  If you
decide on a standard map ahead of time, you can run the images one at a
time.

Also, as far as universal colormaps go, I think that it should be
dynamic.  This is the way that Windoze (shudder) does it.  When you load
an image with a large colomap, the rest of the display is fit to that map.
'Course, that requires changing the values of the pixels themselves
sometimes, so...

Hi.
If you have a maximized Netscape (covers the entire screen), fvwm2 has
trouble switching virtual pages by hitting the edge with the mouse.
If you move the window one pixel, it can switch directly.

I can't get it to happen on any other app than netscape, but the WM should
know where the mouse is, even if netscape is under it...

Fvwm 2.0.46 ('45 as well), Linux 2.0.29, XFree 3.3 (the same with 3.2)
Netscape 4.02b7 and 3.01

I think that the problem may be Netscape's.  I have a double headed Sun,
and I cannot switch heads if Netscape covers the boundary pixel.  That is,
if I run Netscape on the left monitor, and maximize it vertically, so that
it is against the right edge of the screen, I can no longer move the
cursor to the right monitor.  This has nothing to do with the desktop code
for the wm.

'Course I have not tried to do this with any other wm.  (What am I going
to use, CDE?) =20

   I personally do not like this idea for the reason that this will make
   the icons un-accessible to any other program such as xv or gimp (etc.).

   In general I do not like proprietary formats in any system.  Especially
   if the storage format is in binary!  Example the Windows95/NT Registry!
   Explaining why I like how most (if not all) Unix applications (especially
   wm's) have text init files.  Since even if they are in proprietary format
   they are still viewable through ANY text editor.

   I am not sure if I make sense or if others would agree with my logic but
   I tend to not like "closed" systems.

   I like to be able to look at my icons using xv and this format that has
   been suggested would make it difficult, if not impossible, for me, and
   any other user, to do this.

   How does it make it difficult?  I don't follow.  Sorry.

   This may be true.  But don't think it is much of a gain compared to
   the sacrifice.

You need a pixmap editor that can process xpm files.

XPaint is OK for doing icons & stuff like that.  It can usually be
found on most Linux Distributions.  My local slackware mirror has it
at

ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/Linux/
  slackware-mirror/slakware/xap2/xpaint.tgz

It doesn't do transparent colour: (and arbitrarily assigns a colour to
the colour `None' in an xpm file).  It is not too difficult to work
around this; just annoying if you want to make up umpteen icons with
transparent backgrounds in a hurry.

Of course, there is always Xemacs... talk about using a 50 kilonewton
steam hammer to crack a peanut...

I experimented with WindowMaker before I found FVWM2 and liked the
windowshade thing.
I found out how to do *almost* the same thing, but it doesn't exactly
windowshade, it just goes away and leaves the titlebar.
Not that it is important or anything, but I kind of liked how it looked
like an actual windowshade.
How do I make it do that in FVWM2?
I got the animated patch (not sure if it actually "worked" or not) but
don't know how to use it.  I stole a setanimation line from another
.fvwm2rc file, but don't see that it changed ANYTHING.
Who knows where to get info on this,...or do what I want?
I think I would "rather" getting the info and learning how, but if all
you got is a quick fix I'll take it.

Anyway, thanks.

No, it is not possible, because E doesn't support
any modules (yet) :(

There is also a utility called pixmap, written especially for editing
and creating xpm pixmap icons. You can get this from

PERSIST
BE FAITHFUL AND GET RICH

Have you ever wondered why chain letters and multi level marketing strategies fail?  It's not
because they don't work or are intended to trick people into spending money. Because if this was
the case I would be the first one cheated.
MLM(multi level marketing) is based on an exact science which is mathematics and as such if
thing are done right it can't fail.
Venturing into this deal I'm offering could make you a lot of money at the best and some at the
least.
All you have to do is be FAITHFUL
PERSIST and DON'T BREAK THE CHAIN.
So once again I ask you to take the plunge and order  this FREE
FULLY  COMPUTERIZED
version of multi level marketing. That's the beauty of this NEW system
it's fully computerized
and EVERYTHING  is done through the program and your INTERNET browser be it netscape or
explorer.
I was very skeptical about this program
but I carried on.
I want to pass this opportunity to YOU in whom I trust to be persistent and faithful.
TAKE THE CHANCE and if you want this FREE MONEY MAKING  software just reply
INCLUDING IN THE SUBJECT LINE the word SUPER MLM.
In any case
IT'S FREE
so "ORDER NOW" and I will E-Mail you the program TODAY attached as
a ZIP FILE.
Unzip the program
install it and take a look at the "READ ME FILE"
if you still think it's trash

throw it away.

GOOD LUCK

Arturo Meneses

I dont seem to get Netscape to work with the new version of fvwm. It
just starts the program half way and stops. PS shows netscape is running
but it is loaded only half way. I putted 2.0.45 back and it's working
again.

If you really want to have fun with windows, look into DPS.  If you have
Solaris or SGI, or better yet, NeXT, you are set.

Since there is a full PostScript interpreter on board the display server,
anything that you can do in PS you can put on screen, even to animating
the window decorations (Shaped!).  Mostly useless when it comes down to
it.

If you just want the funky decorations, look into ImLib, the image
processing engine that E uses.  It is easy enough to create shaped windows
in X.  It would be easier to add shaped borders to Fvwm than it would be
to fold the two together.

I am sure that if you get a framework going, folks will want to jump in
and help coding.  One big problem you are going to have: Fvwm has only 1
border width, not seperate widths for top/bottom/left/right...  Also, the
positions of reparented client windows are hard coded in many places in
the code.

Also, you are going to have to be able to specify each border seperately,
and turn off the top border.  Corner handles will have to have independent
sizes.

This is not an easy task, and may have to wait for 3.x, but probably well
worth doing.

I wouldn't assume that I know what's going on.  The modifications that
I made were originally for fvwm95.  I added mini-icons to FvwmWinList,
and added the feature that only shows whats on the current desktop.

I was also on the fvwm-workers list(not anymore) and was pushing for
implementing MiniIcons. That eventually that happened.  And I changed
my FvwmWinList to work with both fvwm95 and fvwm2.

My FvwmWinList is part of Fvwm95, but I have never heard of anyone
distributing it with Fvwm2. I will have to go read the archives.
...
Ok, I went to the archives. I guess my stuff was incorporated into
Fvwm2. Cool!!

I need to get back on the mailing list. I was on Fvwm2, Fvwm95,
Lesstif, Ultrasound, fetchmail mailing lists, was swamped and 
got off all of-em.

Did I do that?

Hmm. OK, I did that. Someone needs to write another option to turn
that on/off.

Hi,
  I hope I'm directing this mail to the appropriate address.  I just
wanted to ask where I might be able to get Fvwmaudio from.  Someone said
it was included with Fvwm, but if that's the case I got a copy of Fvwm2
without it.  Thank you for any suggestions you might be able to provide
(I've been looking for it for days).  If this isn't the appropriate
address, I apologize.

Good morning,

I'm trying to write a prooogram that needs to keep track on the mouse's
buttons. So far things works well by catching ButtonPress and
ButtonRelease events. The problem rises when using Linux, XFree86 with
ChordMiddle activated. When both mousebutton are down, you get a Click
event of button 2 (instead of buttons 1 and 3). I can live with it, with
special code, but the problem is that when any of the buttons is released,
a button 2 Release Event is sent; A PointerQuery returns mask 0, and the
only way to know if a mousebutton is still down is to wait for a mouse
movement event and check for the mask *then*. 

Is there any way to recognize the mousebutton which is down immediately
after the release? Is it perhaps possible to programmatically disable
ChordMiddle? My program is an Fvwm module, which grabs the pointer, so
I'll settle for a global ChordMiddle disabling. 

PS: Is there a better newsgroup/list I should consult?

Thanks in advance,

Well, the only reason you see a difference is because the bottom edge is
not getting a border drawn around it. It's as if some psycho chef has
taken a butcher knife and just chopped off everything off of the title
bar :) I'm not a programmer, but I doubt it'd be very difficult to add
some code to the window shade function so that it gets a border on the
bottom. Actually, I think this should be worked into the main
distribution.

I have a patch that does exactly that.  All my windows are missing the top
border, and the title bar extends to the outer edges of the side borders.
When you window shade, there are no borders left.

Also, when you maximize, all the borders are missing.  Just the title bar
is left.

At the moment, shaped windows have a bit of a problem.  As soon as I fix
that, and add config options so that the behavior is not hardcoded, I will
release the patch.

Is there a way/patch to make fvwm2 locate the title bars on the bottom
of the windows instead of the top? Maybe even the side? Or one on each
side? Heh.

Just thought it would be nifty.

The idea is to have window shade roll up like a real window
shade... i.e. you can see it do so.  In fvwm2 it is instantaneous.

I kind of like some simple animations myself during window operations.
Good thing to use multithreading for I suppose.

Good morning,

Of course, I was talking about "Emulate 3-button mouse". That is, using a
both-mouse click to emulate the third, wretched, middle button. Not
ChordMiddle, which I have no idea what it is, anyway.

Yeah, sure. Programming the MicroSoft way, this is: To run app, change
OS. :-)

That's what I've hoped for. Have any addea where I could ask for this?

I'm not after multiple simultaneous  presses. On the contrary, I want it
out of my way. So much for Geom, as far as two-mouse-buttonns are
concerend. To use app, buy a mouse.

Thanks anyhow,

I know :) However, in order to get the nice look that the gentleman
described, the border has to be maintained on the bottom edge (which it
currently isn't).

A quick search of the archive for 'vertical;title' yields some interesting

Option, ofcourse. If the bottom-border remains, it looks fine on
mwm-styles, but bad on others (which is not all flat squares etc)
If removed, looks bad on mwm, good on others.

If you look at my setup (url below, click on 'Datorer'), keeping the
bottom-border would look awful.

fvwm list-

As a new linux user, I have some basic gaps of knowledge about how
things work.  This is why I'm writing to the list for some help.

I downloaded 2.0.46 fvwm - I don't have anything running so I thought
I'd start with the latest release.  I followed some install instructions
- extracting the files etc in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11.

When I type the command 'xmkmf' I get the following error message:

imake - DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
Imakefile.c:13: Imake.tmpl. No such file or directory
imake: Exit code 33
  Stop.

I don't believe this is really a fvwm problem rather a system bug or
something.  I was hoping I might get some help as that's what I'm trying
to install.

I thought the Imake.tmpl was created by the make utility and didn't
'exist'.  Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

Hello, :)

   This sounds neat!  If one is willing to give up so much processing

   Sounds good.  :)  And this brings up my question from a week or so
   ago about fvwm2's ability to make my windows look like what I had
   when running AfterStep:

      [Title bar with no borders and no handles]
      |                                        |
      |       main window (w/no sides!!)       |
      |                                        |
      ==--------------------------------------==

           ^^^ bottom border with two handles ( == ) one at each end.

   If the user could specify the widths for top/bottom/left/right borders
   my problems are *almost* solved :)  just set:
   
      border width = 5
      top/left/right border width = 0
      # note this leaves the bottom border width = 5

   Only thing remains is the handles which are 'L' shaped in fvwm and I
   am not sure how easy/hard it would be to change their shapes. :)

   Any ideas??

   I don't know .. if enough people/users think this is a good idea I
   think it might be worth starting implementation.  Targeting for
   Fvwm 2.2 or something like that.   Or am I too ambitious?  *:-}

I think you may have gotten the wrong idea of what I wanted.
In WM it doesn't have a border on the bottom either, but it "slides" up
like you are watching a windowshade go up.
It goes way faster in FVWM, but I think I am seeing it dissapear from
top to bottom.
It isn't any big deal, I was just wondering if there was a way to fix it
so that it looks more like a windowshade going up.

Hi all,

Firstly, I don't use / like desktops, because you can't jump between
them with the mouse AND the keyboard - thus I only have one desk with
6 screens. When I start Netscape, I normally find an empty screen,
start netscape, and then have to wait the 5 hours that it takes
netscape to get going. What would be really neat is to have fvwm
remember that I started netscape (or any other ap for that matter) on
the screen I was in when I selected the menu item (effectively running
a function), and then automagically made sure that the ap actually
appears in that screen, regardless of which screen I am currently in.
The ap would still think it's running on the normal screen, but it
would actually just appear in the background, as it were. (I can still
see it in the Pager for example).

Is this possible?
Any ideas?

THanks in advance,

Steve

I have a program for my Windows 3.1 machine at home that sets the root
window to an image chosen randomly from a preset list. I was just
wondering if anyone had thought of adding something like this to
xpmroot. 

Just an idea ;)

Chuck,

	regarding FVWM 2.x:  Do sticky icons have a different color than
non-sticky icons yet?  This is one of my favorite .1x features.  Do icons
auto-place themselves on the background yet, so they are automatically
visible (if possible) in a corner that can be user-specified?  I'm
(sadly) still running fvwm 1.x, awaiting these changes in 2.x.

Add too many styles, and Fvwm gets too big/buggy/slow/unusable.  If we
want to add arbitrary window decorations, either adopt the scheme of E,
and use pixmaps w/Shapes for everything, or spend a good long time
thinking about how to structure it so that it is fast/flexible and not too
user-terrifying.

Come up with a spec.  List all the things that Fvwm should do in the
window decoration area.  Then, we have to figure out how to code it.  The,
we will basically have to overhaul all the code.  (which was done for
textured borders, so it is not impossible....)

Start the ball rolling, and see how far it gets.  The problem with
something like this is that if you add support for one new style, that is
all well and good, but helps you not at all to add another.  Adding the
framework neccesary is a big job, with little immediate payoff.  There is
no way to do this in steps.  Tear it down, build it up.  Ick.

I am willing to help, but I have a job, and they actually expect me to

     How about adopting a policy like apache's modules? Certain things can
have a secondary code module compiled in.  Something like fvwm-modules,
only closer to the core, where starting a new process wouldn't be feasable
(ie, window decorations) 
     In this way, fvwm keeps it's normal (supported) behavior... but if
someone wants a new behavior, they can add it themselves without producing
an entirely new Window-Manager.  (ENFVWM (Entirely New-FVWM?))
     I've not looked heavily at the code, so I don't know if this is a
minor adjustment, or a major coding-job.. Either way, I'd be willing to
work on it...

   Thoughts on this?

Aha yes.. I can't find any xv documentation here you see. Still, half

for those who are wondering.. I always found xv to be a bit slow

Thanks, but I've just made a directory and done:

xv -random -quit -root /home/imc/pixmaps/*.xpm

I'd appreciate an explanation of the -rmode bit tho, as I can't find
the xv docs.

This is approximately what I was suggesting.  It sounds like the modules
that you want to use are dynamically loaded, while I was just suggesting
a well defined interface so that you could add a block of code at compile
time.

Major code overhaul.  The current behavior of Fvwm is implicitly hardcoded
in almost all parts of the code.

My FvwmButtons was working terrifically with fvwm2.0.45.  I used to instances of
it: MainFvwmButtons and PagerFvwmButtons.  I had corresponding configuration
lines for each.  Now, with fvwm2.0.46, when I start Fvwm, some of the utilities
spawned by my MainFvwmButtons are seen, as well as some of the ones in
PagerFvwmButtons.  However, the Buttons themselves never appear and the
utilities remain unswallowed.  Was there some change to FvwmButtons or fvwm that
could've caused this?

I invoke the FvwmButtons like this:

Module FvwmButtons MainFvwmButtons
Module FvwmButtons PagerFvwmButtons

I do this inside both my InitFunction and my RestartFunction.  My config lines
are all preceeded by:

*MainFvwmButtons
*PagerFvwmButtons

respectively...  Any ideas?

Brian.

Not quite, perhaps I should have mentioned them the other way around,
ie: I do move around via the keyboard, but at times it's nice to
drag'n'drop from one screen into another, meaning that you also need
to be able to float between screens with the mouse. - this you can't
do with desks. Also, desks make up a one dimentional line, screens can
be organised in 2 dimentions, meaning that you can have 4 directly
adjacent, and another 4 diagonally adjacent screens, making it more
efficient to get from where you are, to where you want to go
[tomorrow]

its a good thing I don't use M$ products, otherwise I'ld still not be
where I wanted to be :-)

> Anyway, I don't know if that helps you at all, but thought I'd throw

Thanks, I knew about the desks solution, but it's not quite what I am
looking for.

I think you should be able to specify which desktop program loads on,
maybe going left to right then down, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So perhaps:

Style "Netscape"    Desk 0, Screen 4, Focus 0 (so it doesn't steal the
focus.

Or something to that effect would put it on the 5th screen, letting you
do other tasks while letting Netscape load. This might be easier than
having FVWM remember all the windows. That could get annoying anyhow.

- when i use a round pixmap in the right top of my

i want that my windows looks like:

Something like this is better done with cron.  Schedule the job when you
log in, unschedule it when you log out.

Then you do not have a sleeping shell script in the process table.

    Actually, you and I seem to be talking about the same thing =).  Not
dynamically loaded, but able to be compiled in when building fvwm... Maybe
distributed as 'contrib' code.

   =/  Hmm.  I'm still willing to look into it/work on it...

NOTE: for rest of email, module=compiled-in optional code, NOT traditional
FVWM Modules

  Hows this for a possible configuration:

	Compile in contrib window-decor module.
	If module specific style used on TitleStyle, etc,
	call the module-decor code for window, otherwise do the 'normal'
	fvwm decor.

In otherwords, make these modules as extensions... as you can have both
'normal' and 'extended' modules compiled at once.

  Is there enough demand/support for making such modifications to the
code?  If this is pursued, how likely is it that it will be rolled back
into the fvwm distribution?  Are there people aside from me who would be
interested in working on this?

I've been interested in working on this for some time, since it is a very
stripped down version of a problem I'm working on for my thesis. I think that
to do it right would require major rewriting of fvwm. I posted something
awhile back on this, but basically I can see using modules for:

1. appearance
2. configuration (both reading in config info and doing run-time
   configuration)
3. policy (how focus gets shifted from window to window, functions which
   manipulate the fvwm window list like Next, Prev, etc)
4. possibly even interfacing with the underlying window system. It would be
   cool if it would be possible to run fvwm on the BeOS or Rhapsody or
   windows.

The basic mechanism that I was thinking of is:

1. As far as the fvwm kernel is concerned, there is only one type of module -
   those writeen in C directly linked into fvwm. 

2. modules written in an interpreted language (please, if this is to be lets
   standardize on only 1 language), would be run by making the interpreter
   into a module, and it handles running the interpreted code. So if we picked 
   python, then we write the necessary C functions to make the python
   interpreter look to fvwm like a module, and then we have python code which
   mediates between fvwm and the python modules.

3. we could have a module which is just a stub, and acts as a proxy via RPC
   for a module running as an external program. Using this stub module, we
   could connect an external program to fvwm and as far as fvwm is concered,
   it's exactly like a directly linked in piece of code. We should have a
   module library so that modules could operate in either mode, just by
   setting the right compile time flags. So I could have my titlebar drawing
   module loaded into the fvwm executable via dlopen(), or have it compiled as
   a seperate executable and it talks to the stub proxy module via RPC. This
   would be useful for both debugging, and having modules which outlive fvwm.

4. Finally, the current fvwm modules would talk to a simple linked in module
   which simply spits out all those messages to the external modules.

The main problem is figuring out which data and functions the linked in
modules are allowed to access, how control gets transferred to them from fvwm,
and sychronization. And if you have multiple types of modules linked in doing
the same thing (like two different look-and-feel modules), how does fvwm
demultiplex between them. Basically, you've got a mini OS (but that doesn't
mean it has to be slow. Here at the U of Arizona we like writing small fast
OS's). 

The hardest part is figuring out how exactly fvwm transfers control to module
code. While the fvwm code is nicely organized, it's not at all modular. The
method we use in the Scout OS to handle this is by having each module export a
structure with a bunch of function pointers. There are various types of
interfaces depending on the type of the module. So a module which handles
window decorations has to export one set of functions (probably many), and a
module which reads in the config file needs to export another (probably just
one: readConfig()). This has the two necessary properities that it: (a)
decouples module A from module B, so that module B can be replaced quickly
with something else, and arbitrary code can be inserted between the two
modules cleanly; and (b) it allows the program to manipulate the functions in
groups.

I am very grateful to all suggestions about how to pop up 
an already open file. I found the best solution to be 
using Next built in function.
I found Next so useful that i decided to employ it to pop up
several 'labelled' or 'named' FvwmButtons from a Master bar.
All 'named' FvwmButtons are launched at start and then popped
up when needed. It would be better to start FvwmButton module
as icon; is it possible to start a module as icon?


Now i have a problem with FvwmButtons Sys, in which i would 
like to swallow several copies of the same application (procmeter) 
invoked with different options.
Procmeter can monitor system resources (cpu, disk usage and access,
swap rate, ram usage, network packet traffic) reporting data as
a time graph. 
Starting procmeter with different options you get a collection of 
plots that monitor the resources of your machine.
Unfortunately the window name in which procmeter is displayed 
does not depend on the chosen options, thus it is not possible to
tell FvwmButton which pre-existing procmeter aplication to swallow.
Even without the 'UseOld' option, the Swallow function seems
to be unable to embody into FvwmbuttonsSys the procmeter process
that has been executed; Swallow embodies the first procmeter that
it catches up. 
As a result, several graphs are not swallowed at all; they are  
left out, on the desktop; it seems that not every Swallow function, 
after procmeter has been executed, completes successfully.
Is there a way to solve this problem?
The best solution would be to change the window name of every 
procmeter application, but i think it is not possible.

Any comments will be appreciated

thank you

Paolo Pumilia

I agree it is annoying the first time you start Netscape, but I actually
take advantage of this slowness when I start an additional Netscape
window, because I have time to switch to a different page before it
appears.

If your suggestion were in force, any additional Netscape windows would
always appear on the same screen as the first.

What I'd like more is a way to specify what page to start an app on, not
just which desk.

Potentially nice module, but it doesn't seem quite ready for serious use yet 
(in fvwm2 anyway; works fine in fvwm95 at home).  With the patches recently 
posted, it works a bit better, but still seems to soak up cpu time.  I suspect 
it's going into a busy wait somewhere.  "Close"ing it also doesn't cause it to 
die, which is incorrect behaviour: the window disappears, but the process 
continues, taking up 80% or so of cpu time.

Something like this would be nice.  In particular, its ability to hide itself 
and reappear when the pointer goes near is a nice way of conserving screen 
space.  I want something like an icon box which should be easily available, 
but don't want to have a real iconman with StaysOnTop or something; 
FvwmTaskBar promises to be just the thing, once it's fixed to work with fvwm2. 
 Don't care about the Start menu---that seems utterly superfluous.  Perhaps 
the same thing would be good for FvwmButtons?

Hi Bruce,

This is the only "good" idea to come from Win95 (IMHO) :-) - I've also
tried to create an application which shrinks itself when the focus
leaves the window, and pops itself up automatically as soon as the
focus enters the mini-window, however with fvwm2 it doesn't work (and
there's a few good, but "technical" technical reasons :-( ).

Of course this would also be possible if the mouse events could be
extended, so that not just things like button events, but also enter
and leave events could be mapped. Then you could have something like:

Mouse	Enter	I	A	Deiconify
Mouse	Leave	F	A	Iconify

all that's missing then is to be able to bind this functionality to a
specific application.

The "technical" difficulty that I spoke of above is simply that if you
try to move or resize a window, during the move or resize operation,
the focus is taken away from the app, and the app gets a focus event
(actually it gets 4!). Also, for some reason the geometry returned by
fvwm is not exactly the same as the geometry given by the application,
so having the application know where it is tends to go a little awry,
for me, the window wanders to the top left of the screen.

The other difficulty was that I didn't actually want to iconify the
window, rather, show a minimizes version of the window, with some key
information. Some uses for this sort of thing that come to mind would
be:
	A mail program, which when minimised shows subjects of a few
	of the newest waiting e-mails. Move the focus (with the
	keyboard or mouse) onto this mini window, and your full blown
	mailer pops up.

	A task tracking program (similar to xtimex) where the current
	activity and time would be shown in the mini window, and the
	full selection of activities when it gets the focus.

	A simple clock, in the mini form you see the time and date,
	in the full size form, you get a scheduler, alarm clock etc.

There are tons of ways in which this idea can be put to good use,
there are just a few things which need to be worked out:

	- how to "SIMPLY" adjust the size and position of the full
	  sized window, and the same for the mini-window (at least as
	  far as positioning goes)

	- how to combine this idea with the ButtonBar (mini window in
	  the button bar, full size window somewhere on the screen)

Perhaps this could be solved with a library (libminimizer?), at the
moment I don't know if X11 needs some slightly different events
(InMotion, Resizing?) or if the way the window manager communicates
with the windows needs to be cleared up a bit, it could also be that
something like this already exists, and I'm just showing my ignorance,
but I am yet to see ANY application which does this sort of thing.

By the way, the mini-windows here are NOT to be confused with icons,
icons are little more than a button saying: "I am an application,
click on me to see what I am", a mini window is a proper application
window, displaying information, but not accepting it (when focus
enters the mini window, the full size window for the application pop's
up, taking the focus with it).

I would be most glad to hear ideas and suggestions about this sort of
thing, and would dearly love to see a working example, maybe you guys
are the ones to pull it off?

PS: this has NOTHING to do with my employer, all comments, brilliant
ideas and errors in this e-mail are mine and mine alone, except of
course the idea of a self hiding application which I gladly borrowed
from M$ (and they've never stolen ideas either - nooooooo ;-)

Is there a way to have the TaskBar oriented vertically.  I had a sloppy
implementation of this iwith FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan, btu I wanted to use
FvwmTaskBar because of its completeness.  But truthfully, a horizontal taskbar
is useless when you have more than 6 or so apps running; the buttons are
squashed to an unreadable width and you find youself waiting for the tips all of
the time.  I'd much prefer a left bound vertical taskba like you can do in
Windows 95.  Is there any hope?

Brian.

I'm shocked.  I couldn't believe it.  My menues have been flashing me!  Ever
since I installed 2.0.46, everytime I move my mouse in my menus, the entire menu
tree flashes annoyingly.  Perhaps this has always been this way, but now it is
slow enough to notice?  Has anyone else experience problems like this?

Perhaps I have overlooked something, but is the FvwmTaskBar supposed to have
icons for the tasks?  I assumed there would be miniicons for each task (where
available), but mine are all empty.  I DO have miniicons compiled in (as they
appear on my title bars where I placed them).

Is it possible to make a function that deiconifies 
an iconified window at the current desk, and warps to it (on another
desk) if it is normal?

I would like to have it for WindowList

Yes, the MiniIcons should be up. I think they did when I first ported TaskBar.
There seems to be an inconsistency between Fvwm2 and Fvwm95 Internals now.
To make it work, go into FvwmTaskBar.c, find where it sets picture and mask to
body[1] and body[2], change that to body[6] and body[7].

Hopefully, someone can tell me why they were changed, and what body[1,2] are
now. Regardless, the FvwmTaskBar, and FvwmWinList code should be changed
so that they used a more approriate dat structure and dont need to use
hardcoded indexes.

Yes, I take back my comment.  It *was* using a high proportion of time, but when I just restarted it, it seems to work OK.  Don't know what's going on, but I suspect some intermittent bug.

 Adam, the problem is not memory consumption, but the number of available
process table entries. Believe it or not, some of the "high-end" workstation
Unices have a more limited process table size than your Linux system (and may
be sharing it with multiple users, too). So Eric's advice is sound for the
general case, though there's no perceptible difference on your system.


 Cheers,
 Bob

this is just a small point, but could the imake file ine the
fvwm directory include commented out instructions for the
modules in extras. it would make life a little easier.


eg
BUILDSUBDIRS = \
          libs \
          modules/FvwmTile \
/*          extras/FvwmWharf \ */
/*          extras/FvwmConsole \ */

/*          extras/FvwmTaskBar \ */
/*          extras/FvwmCommand \ */
/*          extras/FvwmScript \ */

          modules/FvwmWinList

I added a new make variable EXTRASUBDIRS that contains all of the extras
directories with the exception of fvwmperl and fvwmpytyon (that dont "do"
make).


To enable building of the extras, add $(EXTRASUBDIRS) to the SUBDIRS
definition.

Is there any way to force FvwmIconBox to display icon title on the
side of the icon ?! Just like in menu ?!
I have FvwmIconBox swallowed by FvwmButtons and i want to achieve effect
similar to tkgoodstuff window list or FvwmTaskBar.....


any idea on this ?! 

has anybody tried to use FvwmIconMan in conjunction with FvwmButtons
?!

is this combination possible ?! what about auto-resizing window
swallowed by FvwmButtons ??

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have just finished installing - and patching - 2.0.46.

The patches (attached) are as follows:
   modules:
      FvwmWinList:  do not call ShutMeDown in DeadPipe, just exit (to avoid
                    FvwmWinList looping)
      FvwmAudio:    ditto
      FvwmIconBox:  ditto, may need more work if the XDeleteProperty is needed
      FvwmIconMan:  ditto
      FvwmButtons:  do not do X calls in signal handling; also, allow
                    "swallowmodule" as well as "swallow" in FvwmGoodStuff
                    compatiblity [this patch previously submitted against
                    2.0.43]

   fvwm:
     colormaps.c: If, on Sun systems, TRUECOLOR_ALWAYS_INSTALLED is defined,
                  do not install a 24-bit TrueColor colormap. (Despite what
                  the server says, it is always installed.)
     add_window.c: Instead of doing button grabs for click-to-focus using no
                  modifiers and Caps Lock, use AnyModifer
     events.c:    Button press handing: Check for user-defined button action
                  first, then allow click-to-focus/click-to-raise with any
                  modifier.
     placement.c: If a transient has no position specified, fall back to
                  random/smart placement (as per configuration) instead of
                  placing the transient at 0,0

   extras:
     FvwmTaskBar: fixes for signal handling like those above

Other "extras" programs require fixes for signal handling, including (at least)
FvwmWharf. If these programs are not fixed, they can go into a loop when fvwm
is terminated or the X server reset (i.e. logout). I would suggest these
programs be removed from the release, or at least have a very strong warning
attached, until they are fixed.

X-Mailer: VM 6.33 under Emacs 19.34.1
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

As stated in an earlier email, I've noticed a couple of strange things about
FvwmWinList (in 2.0.46)

  1. The entries are always left justified (instead of center)
  2. WinList is wider than it used to be (was " name ", now is "  name  ")
  3. Windows that have focus are displayed pressed in WinList

so I investigated further (you know, to improve my C skills :-) and have added
an option to turn the button-pressed-on-focus look (patch for both module and
man-pages below; not much of a change - an if/else clause), yet I have more
questions.  I'm not familiar with mini-icons (patch added to FvwmWinList in
2.0.46 which introduced features/bugs above), and so I would REALLY
appreciate some pointers (HELP) on the following couple of things.

 a. How does a module know whether mini-icons are enabled (ie. if user is
    using 'em) or are they static (always there) - .fvwm2rc examples ?
 b. bugs listed above (#1,#2) both relate to variable 'newx' within the
    DoButton function (in FvwmWinList/ButtonArray.c) - can someone shed
    some light to how this works (I've been comparing 2.0.45's code vs.
    2.0.46).

    for example,
     I've uncommented line (348) in FvwmWinList/ButtonArray.c

    	newx=max((w-button->tw)/2,4);

     and this solved the left justification problem, yet the width didn't get
     affected (there are lots of other newx lines commented out)


Any HELP would really be appreciated..


BTW: let me know how the patch goes (this is my first one :-D )

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I have a strange problem with a few applications.  When I iconize them,
the icon pixmap does not appear (although the text label does still).

I have the following line in my .fvwmrc:

Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm

This works fine to catch all (or almost all!) unknown applications.  After
that I have a number of "Style" statements for various applications.  Most
work perfectly.

For a few applications, though, this causes the icon pixmap to not appear.
For example (for Andrew applications):

Style "atk"            Icon andrew.xpm

This pixmap is definately available, readable, valid, in the path, etc.

Even if I change this to:

Style "atk"            Icon unknown1.xpm

I get the same result!

Another problem application is Mosaic.  I can't even get the default
"unknown" pixmap for this.

Has anyone else seen this, or got a fix?  Or is it something I am doing
wrong?

Well, I had a similar idea about 1-2 months ago, so if you're stupid, then
I am too :)

Well, my idea was simply to be able to have a multiple xpm/image bank
format (.mxb/.mib? :) which was simply a file containing multiple xpm's.
The file format would simply be a small bank/archive/package of multiple
xpm's, each with a name or tag. I envisioned this as being used in the
following fashion... A user could specify something like this:

Style "xload"	Icon BeOS-xload.xpm
Style "trash"	Icon BeOS-trash.xpm
Style "xfm"	Icon BeOS-folder.xpm
Style "rxvt"	Icon BeOS-xterm.xpm

as the following:

Style "xload"	Icon xload:BeOS.mxb
Style "trash"	Icon trash:BeOS.mxb
Style "xfm"	Icon folder:BeOS.mxb
Style "rxvt"	Icon xterm:BeOS.mxb

Maybe even make fvwm (or whatever program) smart enough to realize that an
image request with a : in it is an mxb!

In the above example, the user would primarily be saving on # of files,
which could mean several different things, as I'll explain after this
commercial break :)

Well, it actually makes it easier, yet messy... If you moved to something
like what I mentioned before, it would make things much easier to
organize. For example, all xterm type icons could be in xterm.mxb, and it
would contain tabs for sun, sgi, NeXT, etc.. which would each return the
respective icons. This would also help start the move to creating
"themes" ... for example, someone could distribute an fvwm2rc with a .mxb
file. Someone else can redistribute another mxb which has the same tags as
the original, however holding different looking icons. This would
be an easy way to change looks without having to manually specify
different files. 

This has an organizational advantage and might/would be very usefull to
some programmers especially since many icons are in 1 file instead or 5-25
different ones.

I originally came up with this idea for use with the Xclass C++ X11
toolkit and the fOX project, however noone has really offered to try doing
it. 

I think it should be a feasible and relatively simple hack to the xpm
library. In forward messages (after this one), someone mentioned that xpm
looks for image.xpm and image.xpm.gz if they try to load image.xpm. I'm
assuming then that a full path is fed to xpm listing directories to
search as well as an icon name to search for in that path. If this is
true, then the search algorithm can be modified to identify a second
argument (icon name) with a : in it as an mxb, and then act accordingly.
This should afford any program that is dynamicly linked to xpm to
automagically support the .mxb format (as soon as the library is
recompiled :)

However, I doubt that's how it works. 

I'm more likely to believe that the search for the file within the
IconPath is performed with fvwm2 itself, and then te full path to the
filename is sent to libXpm. But then again, I'm no programmer (yet :)

Hi folks

The other day I was mucking around with 4Dwm on Irix 6.3, and the
Desks Overview (their pager) had a nice little feature. When you point
at a window in the pager it pops up a little help balloon with the icon
title of the window.

I like this because I keep the pager small and can't use normal labels
or even MiniIcons in such tiny windows.

So I knocked up a little patch to do the same for FvwmPager. I've
included it below.

'patch < file' it in the fvwm-2.0.46 source directory, 
read the man page, and add something like this to your config:

    *FvwmPagerBalloons
    *FvwmPagerBalloonBack Yellow
    *FvwmPagerBalloonFore Black
    *FvwmPagerBalloonFont lucidasanstypewriter-12

I've only tested on Linux/X11R6 so far.


If you go to

    http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/pager.html

you can also get a screenshot and the FvwmPager directory as a tarball.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

ahhh... sorry, my bad, guess you were right :)

However, I think (as some others have suggested to me) that a user option
to have borders on the bottom *after* window-shading would be nice for
those of us who don't have a beveled looking title bar :)

Well, that'll teach me, won't it! I just went to test it on Solaris
before going home for my tea and it blew up in my face. So its now
several hours later and I'm v hungry but I've fixed the problem.

Turns out I had done something very stupid with a pointer. Inexplicably
Linux let me get away with it, but Irix and Solaris weren't quite so
forgiving. Appropriately enough the pointer was called 'dummy' :-)

So, humble apologies for the previous broken patch, and here's a new
one, tested on Linux/X11R6, Solaris 2.5/OpenWindows, and Irix 6.3.

For some reason the diff I made doesn't work with either Solaris or
GNU patch on my Sun box, though it's fine on Linux and SGI. Tried
both unified and context diffs. Any patch gurus out there with ideas?
Meantime, if you have trouble, get the tarball off the web:

    http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/pager.html


Right, following that egg on my face I'm off for some egg on toast for
my tea.

I am wondering if I should replce my 2.0.45 with the 46.
Are there any extra bugs or is this a fix release or what?
I found 45 pretty stable and wouldn't want to replace it if the new one
is less so.

I downloaded the tar file from the URL given but that appeared to
still have the bug that caused a silent fail whenever the pointer
entered the window. However the patch included in the e-mail works
fine on this Solaris 2.5 Ultra 1. Cool addition! I like it. I have two
further comments

1) It doesn't seem to be picking up on the *FvwmPagerBalloonFore black
statement in my .fvwmrc. I specified black but it insists on white. I
think it unlikely that it can't allocate a colourmap entry to "black".
That's okay, I'll just switch my colours around.

2) My pager is in the top right of the screen. Any windows in the
right most pages of the desktop have unreadable balloons, as they go
off the screen. A temporary fix, would be to move the pager I suppose,
but that means moving all sorts of stuff and resetting my IconBox etc
etc.. 

Any way good work so far!  :)

This patch is quite nice but needs two things:

(1) The ability to realise when its too near to the edge of the screen to
place the label in the usual place, perhaps you could nick some code from
the menu sections? My pager is 1x4 [][][][] <- like that  and lives
on the bottom of my screen, I can't see most of the labels as they pop up
off-screen! I don't think it needs code to specify where the label should
go as defined by the user - just as long as it goes somewhere visible.

(2) [deleted after I read the man page!] It needs fixed so that if
fore is specified it is actually obeyed. I quite like the colours from
the mini-windows being specified though; good default.

I finally have my fvwm2 (2.0.45) set up how I like, but now icons are
giving me problems.  Or more correctly, icon *placement*.

At the moment when I iconify an application, the icon is placed near the
minimize pixmap of the application.  What I want is for the icons to be
placed near the bottom of the screen, how do I do this?  I tried defining
an IconBox, but even after I'd done that they just kept iconifying in the
same places. 

Oh, and if there are any other interesting things that can be done with
icons, can someone tell me? (I hear all these things about IconBox,
FvwmIconMan, FvwmWharf and so on).

Thanks,
Andy

You  haven't shown us your icon  box definition.  If the definition of
the icon box  is faulty fvwm2 just  ignores the  definition and places
icons where it likes, as you describe.

The  definition must  specify the  upper right  corner, then the lower
left.  Without  the patch I've  submitted,  "-0" won't  work, use "-1"
instead.

If you like the lower right hand side of the screen,  here's the one I
use:

Style "*"           IconBox -80 240 -1 -1

Heres my config for the IconBox, it works, but I normally use the
builtin "Style Iconbox".

This is in the "Modules" menu:

+ "%mini.iconify.xpm%I&conBox" ConfigIconBox

AddToFunc ConfigIconBox "I" module FvwmIconBox
+                       "I" Style     "*"  NoIcon

Hi, 
I just noticed a minor thing about the new balloons.. If you move the
pointer from another window straight onto a window in the pager and
the balloons get hidden under the pager. I use SloppyFocus for most
windows so I guess this could be something to do with it...

on the subject of the pager, here's  something I had forgotten about
and made do.

could someone have a go at allowing the pager to behave as it does iconified
with a command line option. (I'll have a go but I'm not such a great 
programmer.)

that is show the current desk but without having to be iconified. this would
make it easier to swallow.

perhaps an option like

FvwmPager current

Odd, as I generated the files in the tar from the patch. I'll check on it.

It was a silly bug. I'll include a small patch to go on top of the
previous one at the end of this mail. I'll also update the web page
versions sometime in the next hour.

I knew people would ask for this. Things look the way they do at the
moment because I have the pager at top left :-)

There are a few things to consider:

1. It should be very easy to code so that a balloon that would project
off the screen to left or right is moved horizontally to be visible.
I'll have a go at that tonight.

2. Vertically is slightly more complicated. There is a very good reason
why balloons are always *outside* the window they are describing. It's
to avoid an EnterNotify/LeaveNotify event loop between the balloon
and the window. It would be possible to code around the loop but it
would make the event handling code for the whole module more complex.
I could have the balloon switch to being above the window if below
causes it to be off the screen.

3. How about two more options:

   *FvwmPagerBalloonPlacement: Above | Below
   *FvwmPagerHorizontalOffset: +x | -x

where the offset would determine the placement of the centre of the balloon
relative to the centre of the window. This would be shifted on the fly
to keep the balloon on the screen horizontally as well.

This doesn't feel generic enough ...

I'm very open to suggestions.

I tried to recreate this, but can't. I doubt that it's a focus issue: I use
SloppyFocus myself, but anyway, the balloons should be completely ignored
by the window manager.

I tried playing around with StaysOnTop, but that made no difference. Can you
send me the relevant bits of config, and system info.

I just tried out fvwm-2.0.46 with mini icons enabled. I can get mini
icons on my pop-up menus, but is there a way to get mini icons on the
winlist or in the FvwmTaskBar? I like having mini-icons on the
WinList. I think it makes it easier to find the application I'm
looking for. I use the Style "name" TitleIcon in fvwm95.

I don't follow this list so please e-mail me if you have any
suggestions.

Thanks,

I'm looking forward to trying this out.  I've been using fvwm95 for
about a year now, because I prefered the look of it (with mini-icons) in
comparison to the bland look of fvwm.  The mini-icons do make it much 
easier to identify things visually.

So what's the major difference with fvwm95 now?  
Has anyone made a pros and cons list of comparison?

This may not work perfectly, but what I do is use the geometry option on
the command line or in the fvwm config (menu, buttons, whatever).  E.g.
'rxvt -geometry XxY+1032+7' gives me an rxvt on my second Screen (my
resolution is 1024x768).  This should have a similar (identical?) effect
to a "StartsOnScreen" option.  Remember, with a virtual screen, it is
just treated as a huge screen (2048x1536 in my case: 2x2) of which you
see only part at a time.

Okay, let's try this again.

The patch I sent out yesterday was flawed:
  - the colourmap patch (24 bit truecolor) didn't work
  - the patch to FvwmTaskBar was broken (I did not properly setup for
    select() on the pipe)
  - the click-to-focus patch used the wrong context if the window clicked on
    didn't have the focus

I also have two new patches:
   1) in misc.c, window raising code now handles transients of transients
      (an outstanding defect, apparently)
   2) FvwmTaskBar now gets the configuration from fvwm instead of trying to
      read fvwm's configuration file directly. This means that it will work
      for preprocessed (FvwmM4/FvwmCpp) and dynamic configuration.

A revised patch is attached. If you applied the patch I sent out yesterday,
reverse it (patch -R) or start with a clean fvwm source and then apply the
attached version.

Note that I am *not* the author of FvwmTaskBar. The fixes I am providing for it
are just to help.

Sure, I've attached my entire .fvwmrc. I was chatting to another user
here and he suggested it could be due to AutoRaise being on. But if as
you say they shoud be ignored by FVWM then that doesn't make sense
either.

I'm running fvwm 2.0.46 on a Sparc Ultra 1 with Solaris 2.5. As far as
I know we've only got X11R5 here...

Could you check this patch (i.e., use your mailer to save it, and compare it 
with the original)?  It looks as though your mailer has folded lines, making 
it awkward for me to apply.  It's possible that it's *my* mailer that's doing 
it, of course, but I have reason to think it's not.  (Our MTA certainly 
doesn't fold lines, and MH is pretty good about not fiddling with things like 
that.)  The previous version also suffered this fault.

When I save the patch, I get a file of length 30713, which disagrees with size 
given in the text of the message.

Now I come to think of it, a likely culprit is the mailing list software.  
Perhaps MIME is a bad way of distributing patches?  What about uuencoded 
patches instead?

As far as I can see, the only thing I miss since switching from FVWM95 to
FVWM 2.0.45 is the taskbar.  I can run the taskbar with 2.0.45, but it
seems very slow and the time at the rightmost end flickers like crazy.

Apart from that, I'm glad to have a wildly different colour scheme than
FVWM95. :)

Not really..
If you have 2x2, and you are on the first (top,left) screen and start with
+1032+7, it will come to screen 2 (top,right). This is fine.
If you are on screen 2, and start with +1032+7, it'll end up right
_outside_ screen 2. The +X+Y is _relative_ from where you are now, not
from the top right corner.. (Haven't looked to deeply in the fvwm2 code,
is it X or fvwm[2] behaviour?)

It is neccesarily fvwm2 behavior.  X knows nothing about Fvwm's multiple
desks/virtual screens.

Looks to me like the code being discussed is in fvwm/placement.c.

Hi folks

I've added some more features to the Pager balloons. Now ...

 - horizontally, the balloon is centred on the pager window, but
   will move so as not to go off the edge of the display;

 - vertically, you may specify a y offset: +n places the
   balloon n pixels below the pager window, -n places the
   balloon n pixels above the pager window;

 - it is possible to set the balloon window border width and colour.


You can get the new patch or a tarball from

    http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/pager.html

Have fun!

Maybe it's YOUR (hence ownership) software. I've never had a problem with
MIME encoded stuff on a mailing list. If you're getting errors in the
reported size, maybe you should check to see (with netscape) what the
message on the archive looks like. Netscape should see the nice mime
ttachment.

Hi-

I tried to compile FvwmTaskBar (w/ Fvwm2.0.46) for solaris, and it all
appears to work fine, but when it runs, it doesn't set the X resource
and class correctly, so none of the "Style" setups take hold. 

Any ideas?

You're correct that Class and Resource aren't set, but

   Style "FvwmTaskBar"	NoTitle, HandleWidth 0

still worked for me (2.0.46/Linux/X11R6).

Style checks window name if class and resource aren't matched.

Nevertheless, the below patch to FvwmTaskBar.c should set the class and
resource. Not properly tested ... caveat patcher!

OK, this is to do with AutoRaise. A free-floating Pager never gets the
focus (this can be changed with Style "FvwmPager" Lenience) and is thus
unaffected by AutoRaise and the problem doesn't arise.

However, if you swallow the Pager into FvwmButtons the buttons *can* get
focus. Make another window overlap the swallowed pager. Move into this
window so it gets focus and AutoRaises. Then move directly into a little
application window in the Pager. The Pager pops up the balloon, but then
some short time later AutoRaise raises the whole FvwmButtons over
the balloon. Curses!

One way to get round it would be to make the FvwmButtons ClickToFocus.
But, of course, you may not like that.

I'll work on it :-)

I've been trying to write a function which will
do three things (screensaver and locker won't play
nice together);

command 1	kill a screensaver
command 2	start a screenlock
command 3	restart the screensaver

The thing is, can I write it such that these commands are
executed _in order_? ie I don't want command two to start
until command one is finished. Is this possible? I can't
find anything in the fine manual.

Mm, the newer pager is much better; but could it not
have a x/y-offset option of 'auto' where it'll
put it in the default place unless it's going to be off
the screen? My pager is on the bottom of my screen, most
windows are fine, their balloons are visible. A window
near the bottom of the pager however will have a balloon off-
screen. But it I set it so that this is avoided then my
balloons for windows higher in the pager appear outside the
pager and hence I can't see them (autoraise interferes
a bit).

If this is way too tricky then fair enough, but it'd be 
a better behaviour. More automatic = good.

Well, I compiled the new version and set FvwmButtons to ClickToFocus
and I'm rather pleased with the whole thing.. To be honest, I can't
think of anything further I'd like added to improve it.

Nice one.

I seem to remember from a while back a discussion about a program
which reduces a bunch of pixmaps to a common colourmap. I hunted
around in the archives and couldn't find what I was looking for.

My problem is that I have designed a new set of icons which started
off all using the same 32 colours. However, I designed them using a
package on my Windows PC at home as the graphics stuff here at work is
not good for this kind of stuff. This meant I had to save them as GIFs
and then convert them to XPMs. I also reduced the number of colours
for each pixmap to 8, however the total number of unique colours for
the whole set has jumped to about 150 (!) . What I want to do is force
them all back to having the same 8 colours between them.. 

Does anybody know a package that'll do this?

By the way, if you want a quick look at the icons there's a GIF of the
whole lot somewhere on one of my web pages..

Cheers,

Martin.

That sounds like the best solution.. O hang on I don't have Buttons
set as StaysOnTop as I use lots of big plotting windows and it gets in
the way sometimes... I also don't like it staying on top of title bars
(it's at the top of the screen.. Well, I'll give it a try it should
work...

There has been lots of discussion about this.

In 2.0.47  we   plan to introduce  the   "colorlimiting patch"  that I
submitted.   This  patch does not   require the xpm's  to  be changed,
instead, the patch limits the xpm colors as they are read in.

If you can't wait, and can't  find my previous  submission, I could be
persuaded to mail you a copy.

There is something in netpbm that will do this.  Basically what it does is
stick all your icons into one big picture, reduce that to however many colors,
and then cut them apart again.

Hi everybody

Below I included the quick and dirty patch (against official
fvwm-2.0.46 source tree) which will allow us to have the long asked
;-) windowshade animation.

As this friday evening is for me a big event (my first X Window
micro-hack), I was too excited by the result not to post it. In fact
the functionality is hardwired and my attempt to program some config
avail was unsuccessful. Even if I think I understood how the builtin
functions mechanism works, the RC parsing routine stubborns to pass
over my WindowShadeAnimate command until the "desperate" Module call.

As a consequence, there isn't (for the moment) a possibility to take
the animation out at run time.

In the next phase (after I'll get also some sleep in the account of
the before past week :-) I'll rip the window manager off my X session
and I'll start it through gdb. 

The patch is really simple and hopefully it will not break anything
(at least over here it doesn't :-).

All the credits for this patch must go to the guys from the AfterStep
team :-), to the author of the first version of WindowShade and to
Chuck and all the others, for their crystal-clear code (even a zero
skilled novice as I am understands it (if he gets some rest before -
now you know why I didn't figure out how to program the
config part)).

					Cristian

Have fun with it. Here it is. Patch it in the root directory of your
fvwm-2.0.46 source tree.

Nice to "meet" you again

I finally covered by debts to Morpheus last night and today, when I
came back to my indecentely easy to use computer, I found the problem
with the config of the WindowShadeAnimate. In fact, I finally read
with more attention the man page for bsearch(3).

So, here is the second patch for the WindowShade animation. Now the
WindowShadeAnimate parameter can be tuned from the FvwmTalk for
example. Of course, the normal use would be to put it in your
.fvwm2rc.

I also added the WINDOWSHADE preprocessor flags there where
necessary. This hopefully eliminates possible compile time errors in
case of choosing not to use WINDOWSHADE at all.

The hardcoded default WindowShadeAnimate is off. So you _have_ to add
the command to your .fvwm2rc with a parameter in order to see it at
work.

As a known bug, if you move the title bar of a shaded window, the
window deshades by itself (not wanted) but remains flagged as shaded,
so next time one tries to shade it, it will not do it.

The TODO list contains now: patching the manual and trying to get lower
border stay visible after a shade (you know, having the border all
around the title), as a run-time option.

				Cristian

After unsuccessfully seeking to change the automagically generated
colors for the hilight/shadow bevel colors, I assume it's not in there
yet. But I thought I'd ask anyway, can ya do it? Maybe I just missed
something? :)

I just want white for the hilight and black for the shadows. The
auto-colors are kinda fugly. Life's a crisis, I know! But I'm going for
a Amiga Workbench 1.3 orange/blue color scheme, someone's gotta
understand :)

Blah. I found a way to fix it already by editing the colors.c file.

Sorry for the inconvenience. But it looks hip. :)

Looking for any decent bitmap font editors for Linux/X. Preferably that
can make new fonts from scratch--I can't seem to find anything. Thanks-

Subject: FVWM: Hilight/Shadow

After unsuccessfully seeking to change the automagically generated
colors for the hilight/shadow bevel colors, I assume it's not in there
yet. But I thought I'd ask anyway, can ya do it? Maybe I just missed
something? :)

I just want white for the hilight and black for the shadows. The
auto-colors are kinda fugly. Life's a crisis, I know! But I'm going for
a Amiga Workbench 1.3 orange/blue color scheme, someone's gotta
understand :)
