Hello,


FvwmTaskBar's man-page gives an example configuration that contains the 
lines:

   Style "FvwmTaskBar" NoTitle,BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4,Sticky,
   StaysOnTop,WindowSkipList,CirculateSkip

I had problems with this:

First the style-config should be in one line (or written as continued 
line, if this is possible). If you copy&paste this, it will result in an 
error. (This is not really a problem, but would be a slightly 
enhancement ;) )

Second the attribute "WindowSkipList" gives an error (Bad Style option) 
with my fvwm 2.5.5. Is this because my config or the 
example-configuration is incorrect?


(Maybe i have got the old version of the man-page because i have 
installed fvwm2.5.5 and debian-stable-fvwm 2.4.6 (to have the 
debian-menus supported)? It would be good to include the version number 
in the man-page of FvwmTaskBar as it is done in fvwm's man-page)


Thanks,

Gert

Thats a typo in the man page.
It should be WindowListSkip and there should be a backslash at the
end of the first line.

Its now fixed in CVS in both the 2.5.x and 2.4.x branches.

Thanks.

Hi!
Is it possible to get the WindowList to focus (and possibly raise) the
selected window each time you hit tab and then do a flipFocus when you
release the meta key (if you're using alt-tab)?

This behaviour (or something similar) is found in blackbox.

Regards, 

Johan Hovold

I use FPGrabFocus to force a particular app to grab the keyboard focus
after it's launched.  When the app exits or is iconfied, FVWM 2.5.5
doesn't restore the focus to the app underneath the cursor (usually an
xterm) until I physically move the cursor out of the window and back
into it.  I'm trying to reduce my dependence on the mouse.  How can I
work around this behavior?

Here are the relevant lines from my fvwmrc:

	Style "*" MouseFocusClickRaises
	Style TLtodo   FPGrabFocus

	DestroyFunc popup-todo
	AddToFunc popup-todo
	+ "I" Next ("TLtodo") Warp-and-Raise
	+ "I" None ("TLtodo") Exec /home/tlau/bin/todo.py
	+ "I" Wait TLtodo

	Key t     A    SC   popup-todo

Thanks,

I'm almost sure there isn't, but I'll ask just in case I'm missing something:
is there a way to specify the point in a menu at which a new item should be
inserted, instead of the usual "append to end" (or some equivalent method to
achieve the same goal)?  This would be handy in fvwm-themes where your personal
theme is only given a chance to add menu-items once the default menus have been
already setup... sometimes it would make for a nicer menu if the personal theme
could add some items a bit earlier in the list.

Hello,

while experimenting with fvwm i have found a funny thing:

I do have an empty .fvwm2rc file (0 bytes of size) for my fvwm 2.5.5. 
Now i do the following things:

Choose "Issue FVWM Commands" from the default menu.
Enter the following 2 lines:

   Module FvwmPager
   Style FvwmPager sticky

Open up an xterm on each page.

Use the right mouse button to scroll around the screen in the 3x3 Pager
of Desk 0.

The Result is not as expected (The screen should exactly follow the
mouse). Instead the screen drives around in circles and bezier-like
curves even if i move the mouse on a linear way. The faster i move the
mouse, the more crazy the pager becomes.

Sometimes this does not happen right from the start but i have to click 
on the xterm windows before and play with the pager a little bit.

What can this be?

Thanks,

Gert

Is mouse acceleration enabled?
Maybe this could be the cause the movement isn't even.

@ FVWM-Team

After I updated my RedHat 7.1 to 7.3 there was a Problem when starting the FVWM-Desktop (version 2.4.6).
The X-Console reported the problem: Could not load font adobe-helvetia-12-*-*-...
This Font is defined in the fvwmrc for the buttons @ the fvwm-desktop.
When I log in as root with KDE-Desktop there is no Problem to load this font, so I think it should be already installed on my system.
In my XF86-Config the fontpath are all defined at the Section "files".

Please tell my if there is another config-file I have to edit, or if there is a solution for my problem.

Thanks a lot,

M0therbr@in

As useful as this might be,
I don't think there currently is any way to do this.

could it be that you use de_DE@euro ISO-5589-15 as locale? in this case
you need to install the transcoded fonts, or fvwm won't find them. i
don't know if redhat packs the transcoded fonts into their default font
packages or not. for debian the transcoded fonts are in the packages
xfonts-*-transcoded.

i had this problem too, when i switched my locale to de_DE@euro and fvwm
didn't want to start at all because it could not load fonts.

I'm writing an application in Java Swing (Sun JDK 1.4.1).  When the
application comes up, it's always positioned off the upper-left corner
of the screen, so that the titlebar and left border are not visible.
I use FVWM 2.5.5.

How do I get FVWM to position the window correctly?

Thanks,

Because i am new to fvwm i am not sure: Has it something to do with 
"focus" vs. "flipfocus" (see man fvwm)?

Thanks for answering, but that wasn't it.  I've tried with bot Focus and
FlipFocus in the WindowListFunc.

This behaviour must've changed since I last used Fvwm (2.5.3 or
something). :/

I think I've seen this before with Java apps, but right now
I can't reproduce it.  I'm using current CVS (I don't think
thats why its working), and Sun JDK 1.4.1-01.

My placement policy is:

Style * ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement
Style "*" UsePPosition

	You might try adding

        Style * FixedPPosition

in the 2.5 series. I think this is the one that did it for me.

Hallo.....

I am a newbie for fvwm. 

I have developed a database application with PHP4.
This application running on a web server. That's why
the user need a web browser (mozilla).

But my boss wants that his sales (sellers) can not use
(see) anything on their computer except the database
application of mine (mozilla).
And he also wants, once the user log-in than the
mozilla will be launched and if the user closes the
mozilla than he/she will be automatically kicked out
(log-out).
During the user is logged in, she/he can not see and
use any other application except mozilla.

I heard fvwm is better in this situation. But I don't
know how to implement that.

Please tell me. I am looking for a complete
dokumentation of fvwm but I can not find that.

Thank you very much in advance.

Hi.. Martin.

You mean without XWindows? Is it possible?
And How should I write the command in the
"/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc" to launch the mozilla?

Is it also possible to kick the user out (logout) if
they close the mozilla?

Hi Martin...

What is the syntax to call the mozilla from
"~/xinitrc"?

If the user minimizes the mozilla, it means she/he can
open any other application and play with it. My boss
doesn't want it.

Pffhh.....I will learn bash-shell after this problem
finish.

Everything is getting clearer.

Hey my friend, martin. I still have two questions. 
1. Do I have to use fvwm or I can use any window
manager to do this thread?
2. What is the difference between XWindow and window
manager?

TAC.

Well, it is very of you.

Thank you very much. Now, I have enough brave to start
my task in Sunday (Holiday for the sales).

I will do that. Thank you very much for you and for
Martin.

Thank you very much in advance.

Why don't you just make the users shell mozilla, then when they exit they log out?

I just tried:

useradd -c 'Mozilla' -d /home/moz -g test -G test -m -s /usr/bin/mozilla  moz

now if I log on as user moz (assuming logging in from xdm or gdm or equivalent) I just get mozilla, and when I quit I get logged out.....

I don't know if there is some way to run shell commands from within mozilla that may need to be removed, and you may need to specify a size for the mozilla window.....

Hi guys, I am using the 2.5.5 version and I'm facing a problem using fltk windows.
When I increase the window size, the window is notified, but when it shrinks the window isn't.
Do you you know how to solve that problem?

Is "fltk" the "fast light toolkit" at www.fltk.org?

I didn't see any fvwm problems in their bug database, but they did
have a recently fixed OSX resize bug.

I think its unlikly that Fvwm is doing something different
for windows that decrease in size vs. windows that grow in size.
What makes you think this is an Fvwm problem?

Yeah, that's it!

Because I've tested the same application in WindowMaker and the problem didn't happen!

I may well have overlooked it (once again), but how do you set a style
for window based on its class?

For example, I know I can do:

Style "Xyz*" blah blah...

...and it will set style blah blah for any window with a title starting
with Xyz.

However, some apps have windows with many different titles, yet the same
class, at least as reported by the Identify module. For example, GnuCash
(once again, as shown via the Identify module) - The main accounts
window has a resource of GnuCash, while dialogs have a resource of
gnucash. However, they both have a class of GnuCash. How can I take
advantage of this consistency (and "consistent inconsistency", as I call
it)? Or am I misundstanding something about class and resources?

There's the statement in the fvwm man page that styles can be set by
class ("stylename can be a window's name, class, or resource  string")
and that $c is the current window's resource class, but never really
explains how, at least in a manner I understood.

I'm primarily interested in managing titlebar buttons in instances where
the full set would be inappropriate. Rather than explicitly nailing down
each and every possible title, I'd like to be a bit more focused.

Thanks!

Currently styles match name, class, or resource.
There has been discussion of an enchancement to make the matching
more specific, but so far nothing has been done.

I don't know why it works with WindowMaker but not Fvwm.

An application is supposed to redraw itself when it recieves a
ConfigureNotify event.  Fvwm is sending the ConfigureNotify, but
fltk purposely doesn't redraw itself when it gets that event,
it waits for an expose event instead.

I think the expose event comes from the X server.  It looks like
the X server is sending the expose when the window is made larger,
but not when its made smaller.  I think fltk is at fault.

You can "fix" fltk by making the change below, in src/Fl_x.cxx.
My change is marked with "dje":

void Fl_Window::resize(int X,int Y,int W,int H) {
  int is_a_resize = (W != w() || H != h());
  int resize_from_program = (this != resize_bug_fix);
  if (!resize_from_program) resize_bug_fix = 0;
  if (X != x() || Y != y()) set_flag(FL_FORCE_POSITION);
  else if (!is_a_resize) return;
  if (is_a_resize) {
    Fl_Group::resize(X,Y,W,H);
    if (shown()) {
      redraw(); i->wait_for_expose = 0;	// originally 1, dje
    }
  } else {
    x(X); y(Y);
  }
  if (resize_from_program && shown()) {
    if (is_a_resize) {
      if (!resizable()) size_range(w(),h(),w(),h());
      XMoveResizeWindow(fl_display, i->xid, X, Y, W>0 ? W : 1, H>0 ? H : 1);
    } else
      XMoveWindow(fl_display, i->xid, X, Y);
  }
}

If you're not working from source, you might want to forward this to
the fltk developers.

I am new to Fvwm so I am sorry for the incredibly simple question I am =
about to ask.=20

I have installed cygwin and selected fvwm to be installed with it. I =
start my X and get the standard twm up and running but I want Fvwm and =
can't seem to figure out what executable to run. When I do a find for =
fvwm I get this:

$ find / -name fvwm -print
/usr/X11R6/sbin/fvwm
/usr/X11R6/share/fvwm

Both are directories which contain all kinds of wonderful thing but none =
of them are the window manager itself. What am I missing here, shouldn't =
there just be a fvwm executable that I can add to my xinit?

Thanks=20

Look for an executable named fvwm2.

"xset q" tells me

Pointer Control:
   acceleration:  2/1    threshold:  4

but i think this is not the problem. The movement is not only un-even. 
The grey box that displays the screen-location in the pager moves around 
in circles and other none-linear moving-paths even if i move the 
mouse-cursor linear. Strange.

Is nobody able to reproduce this?

Hi guys and gals,

I have made a very nice FvwmButtons with a lot of buttons
with pretty pixmaps.

Is there a way to have "balloon" help for these buttons?
That way when the mouse pointer hovers over a button, a
tiny window will pop up right there with a brief description
of the button's function.

I don't want to use "Title" to add labels to each button,
because that detracts from my very artistic design :-)
My setup is being used by a large number ( >100 ) of people.
They would rather have a balloon help rather than find out
by trial and error what each button does.

Sorry, there is no support for balloon help in FvwmButtons.
Patches might be accepted.

I think I figured out what you are talking about, but I don't see
a problem.

I'm not sure I  can move a mouse in  a perfectly linear way (always at
right angles).  So maybe I'm not appreciating some subtlety of
whats happening.

On my system, Fvwm lags behind the mouse (as I think it would be
expected to) and I think X is throwing away some of the X traffic
which might be what you are seeing.

Fvwm doesn't attempt to keep the screen updating synchonous, and
you wouldn't like it if it did.  The effect would probably be a lot
worse.

If you think I'm missing something, or this is causing a problem,
feel free to provide more details.

I would like to subscribe to this list. I have many questions. Firstly,
why do my different tool boxes (not sure what exactly they are)
dissapear when I start X? How do I find out how to config FVWM? Is the
rc file the only config file?

Thanks

John

While reading the fvwm man page that comes with 2.4.5, I spotted
a couple of typos/omissions.

  o  In the description of the "XorValue [number]", the type and
     range of acceptable numbers are not specified.

  o  In the description of %Space and %Tab ItemFormat options, we
     have a garbled sentence:
               Add a gap as large as one respectively eight
               spaces are with the font used in the menu items.

There is no practical limit to this number, its the maximum value
of an unsigned long on your system (but also dependent on the
number of bits of color your system uses).

I did update the man page for this.

Yep fixed too.

The command "Style FvwmIdent StaysOnTop" does not seem to work
in FVWM version 2.4.5.

The FvwmIdent window is placed always within the same layer as
the queried window.  Its StaysOnTop setting is ignored.

This is a feature to help users without FvwmIdent StaysOnTop.

In 2.5.x, the default logic is better and you have more control on the
layer of FvwmIdent, see its man page.

I'm not sure what you mean.  What tool boxes?

You have 2 main choices, read the fvwm man page and
edit your config file with an editor, or use fvwm-themes.

You can find fvwm-themes here:

http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

> Is the

By default, fvwm looks for the config file:

$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

You can override that from the command line.
Any config file can read other config files, so your config
file can be organized into as many parts as you like.

Hi,

I am currently running FVWM version 2.4.4 on Linux workstations. When an =
application is started, the window manager opens a new window for the =
application and it works fine. However, when I click a buttom on the =
appication window that is supposed to open up a new window, it does not =
open it up. The question is therefore, what is the reason that the =
application does not seem to be able to open new windows? How can I =
correct this?

BR, Janne Suontausta

You have 2 choices.

First, just don't automatically raise a window when clicking in it.
I.e. use ClickToFocusRaisesOff and MouseFocusClickRaisesOff (actually
this is a default). To raise a window in this case you may bind some
keyboard or mouse bindings to decorations or even inside a window (just
not a plain click using mouse buttons 1, 2 or 3). In 2.5.x, there are
more settings to control auto-raising on click.

Second, try "Style * RaiseTransient", seems to do want you want if the
application correctly sets Transient flag. Also play with Style options
LowerTransient, StackTransientParent. In 2.5.x there is additionally
RestackTransients command.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It is most probable that there is a bug in your application.

Do you see any error messages in your regular X output?

Did you try to run this application with another window manager or
without window manager at all, just using the plain X or Xnest?

Mikhael.

Well, it is still either a bug in the application or in the window
manager. How to reproduce this problem? Which application do you run?

Perhaps the window is opening underneath the main window?

Hmm, as i understand you, this would result in a slightly 
stottering/uneven moving of the grey screen-box, but it still follows 
the way of the mouse correctly.

It is hard to describe this in english, but i try to describe how i move 
the mouse and how the screen is moving:

I number the desktop pages as follows:

0 3 6
1 4 7
2 5 8


I e.g. start the mouse movement in page 8 and move it in a normal speed 
on a linear way to page 0. This takes approx. about 1 second, i guess, 
maybe 1,5.

At the beginning the grey screen box (i call it "the screen" from now 
on, because the whole screen moves the same way as the screen-box of the 
pager) lays under the mouse cursor on page 8. It starts moving into the 
correct direction and in the beginning follows the mouse. This may be a 
little stottering and uneven but the screen does keep the correct direction.

Approx. when entering page 4, the screen starts moving in small circles 
around the still linear moving mouse cursor (mostly clockwise). At the 
end of page 4 the screen rotates through the pages 0,3,6,7,8,5,2,1, etc. 
and sometimes stucks in an edge-page. Sometimes the movement of the 
screen is not circular, but it moves to the left and right in a 
direction of 90 degrees to the mouse movement.

Well, i could try to draw a small png image that displays an example of 
the movement and post it here if i am allowed.


Somewhere in the fvwm-docs i have read that you should not start a 
module using "Module", but add it to the start-function. Can the 
starting of FvwmPager with "Module" be the problem?

Thanks,

Gert

Please reply to the list.

Since this is not a freely available application, I can't test it.
Maybe others can.

No need, using these instructions, I see it now.

Is there any way to make/fake a given keybinding apply to in a given desktop?
For example, I would like Shift-Alt-1 to take me to one window on desktop 1,
when I'm in desktop 1, while in desktop 2 I want that same key combo to take me
to another window (which is on desktop 2).  The basic idea I'm shooting for
here is that each desktop is dedicated to some particular task I'm working on,
and the windows particular to that task are easily accessed using numeric
bookmarks such as above, with the bookmarks being different for each
task/desktop.  Thus during work I could use one of the Desktop selection
keybindings first to hop to the right task, and then use a second, "memorized"
combo to get me to a desired window for the task.

Dan, I've sent to the fltk development people, what you suggested, and this is what they send me back:

Actually, I checked the Xlib Programming Manual and the
documentation on ConfigureNotify seems to indicate that the
application should only force/perform a redraw for Expose and
GraphicsExpose events - ConfigureNotify ONLY specifies that the
window has been resized.  From page 75:

     The ConfigureNotify branch, in all applications, will calculate
     the values of variables based on the new window size.  These
     variable values will then be used to calculate where to draw
     things in the Expose branch the next time an Expose event
     occurs.  A ConfigureNotify event is always followed by one or
     more Expose events.

Note the last sentence, which is supported in other sections of
the same manual...

So either fvwm or X server is at fault for not following the X11
specification, and given that only fvwm seems to exibit this
problem, it is likely a fvwm bug.

Setting the redraw() flag but not waiting for an expose could cause
unnecessary redraws on compliant window managers, so I'm not inclined
to add this "fix" to FLTK...

It there a way to map the Motif osfCopy and osfPaste functions on
myh keyboard somewhere using fvwm 2.4.15.

I run fvwm on a Sun running Solaris 8. I have a commercial
application that uses those two funtions. Using dtwm, those
functions are normally mapped to the Copy and Paste key of the Sun
keyboard.

I'd like to reproduce this in fvwm2. Any ideas?

This doesn't have anything to do with Fvwm.

Under CDE take a look at the environment variable
XKEYSYMDB.  Make sure you set it to point at the same file
when running Fvwm.

I'm pretty sure that will do it for you.

Hear, hear.  My #1 wish list item for FvwmButtons.  The only liability in an
otherwise fine module.

Hmm, I'm bcc'ing Michael since I see he took pains to hide his
email address.

Check out this xfree man page:

http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/XResizeWindow.3.html

That indicates that the expose events come from the X server.
BUT, it also says that the expose events are optional.

I don't know what I can do to Fvwm to force the X server to
generate the expose events that fltk wants.

You might call this an X server problem, but I'm not sure they
will accept this as a problem since what the server is doing is
consistent with the man page.

I think it is fvwm but maybe I'm explaining wrong.

That application remaps the entire keyboard and mouse functions. So
inside the application, the Cut/Copy/Paste keys work fine. The
problem starts when I'm trying to Cut/Copy/Paste from outside (say,
from an Xterm) to that app.

In normal CDE, the Cut/Copy/Paste keys are mapped to osfCut, osfCopy
and osfPaste functions. So I select some text somewhere and hit the
Copy button, I can than go inside the app and hit the paste button
and it works fine.

When running fvww, those keys are not mapped to anything so of
course, it doesn't work.

And since the app remaps the entire keyboard layout and mouse
functions, the middle-mouse-button pasts function does NOT work.

Any ideas?

Hi,

I am running fvwm version 2.4.14 on top of KDE and am really impressed =
with it but I was just wondering is it possible to set or change the =
text (title) of an icon (i.e., whenever I iconify a window) using the =
Iconbox method.

Your help will be much appreciated.

It is solved with fvwm2. I like fvwm2 from now on
especially its kiosk-ing. Very far better than KDE and

Is it possible for me to joined fvwm2 development?

Thank you for your explanation.

The reason you see this problem with Fvwm and not other window
managers is that Fvwm resizes windows by calling
XMoveResizeWindow instead of XResizeWindow.

Fvwm uses this function because it has a "ResizeMove" command.

I doubt we'll be doing any changes to use XResizeWindow instead,
fltk still wouldn't work right with the ResizeMove command.

I doubt we'll be adding an exposure event after the resize,
thats the X server's job and besides, it would cause other
applications to possibly redraw themselves twice.

I can see why the X Server might send an expose event when a window
is made larger, and not when its made smaller, but I don't know why
it only does this on an XMoveResizeWindow.
I guess its possible the XFree developers might help with this.
I didn't test any of this with other X servers.

The "optimization" fltk is doing seems like a good thing, but
its not consistent with the ICCCM and the XFree man pages since
neither says the exposure is required after a resize.  I agree that
the XLib manual says there will be an exposure.

I'm not sure I understand.  Maybe this will help.

The copy key, like any key generates a key code.
Thats a number.

X associates the key code with a keysym.
You can see the key code and the keysym by using
/usr/openwin/demo/xev

just start it up, move the pointer into the window and press the
key.

Motif apps, for some crazy reason, have their own names for
the keys, thats the name "osfCopy", etc.

As far as I know, most Motif apps have a KEYSYMDB that they
use to understand keys.

Heres one line from one of the many KEYSYMDB files on my system:

osfCopy                         :1004FF02

I think what this is doing is telling the Motif app how to
convert the scan code to the Motif name "osfCopy".

"Normal" x application just use the keysym.

If you are trying to get an XTerm to understand the copy/paste keys,
you need to find out what X resources have been set for the xterm.
Try this in CDE:

appres XTerm

This might show some translations that have been set up so that
XTerm knows how to use a keysym to do a copy.
Look for something like this:

*VT100.Translations:    #override  ...
        <Key>F16: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0, CLIPBOARD) \n\
        <Key>F18: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD) \n\

You can put those translations in a file and use
xrdb to load them when you start fvwm.

Hi FVWMers,
I have to question about fvwm. Please reply also by eMail to me because I am
currently not subscribed, which will hopefully change in the near future. :-)

The first question is about the Status of fvwm current. Is the Layer stuff back
working? Exist any other things that are unstable?

Second question is about the 'window browser' which pops up when I press
alt-tab. I am looking for way that Alt-Tab only shows the stuff on the local
Page (not Desktop).

Greetings,
	Thomas

The answer highly depends on your configuration.

Replace "WindowList params" with "WindowList (CurrentPage) params".
Also please see the man page.

The text you see in iconified windows is supplied by an application.
With some applications (like xterm) you can freely choose the icon name,
for example, by specifying it on the command line. Other than this you
can't freely change the text appearing in the icon title.

Hello,

i am not sure if this (everybody should know the corresponding Amiga 
commodity ;) ) is a window manager or X topic: Is it possible to remove 
the mouse pointer from screen when pressing a key? The mouse pointer 
should be reanimated at the last position again when moving the mouse. 
This would be very useful when using SloppyFocus.

Thanks,

Gert

The program you are looking for is called unclutter. Just put it in your
InitFunction and you will have what you're looking for.

Hello everybody,

I've been using fvwm2 for a few months now, like a a lot (I come from 
gnome + sawfish). There is one thing that gives me some trouble, that's 
how do I give windowtitles their background and text color?

If I want active windows to have green text on a solid red background 
and inactive windows yellow text on a solid blue background (bwaaa... 
it's just an example :-), what would be the minimal commands in 
.fvwm2rc to do this?

This sounds very simple, but maybe something else in my rc (one single 
file of 281 lines) is in the way. I don't use themes, want to do it all 
by hand to get to know fvwm better.

TIA for any help!

If you want to do it with colorsets:

Colorset 0 fg green, bg red
Colorset 1 fg yellow, bg blue
Style * Colorset 1, HilightColorset 2

You can also do it using Foreground, Background, ... options of Style
(see man pages).

cheers,
Remko

I have tried getting both 2.4.15 and 2.4.6 working on RedHat 8.0, but in 
both cases, the menus are invisible.

My .xsession-errors files contains a large number of errors.

Does anybody have any idea what might be causing this? I've tried my old 
fvwm2rc files and the example ones. I always get the same problem.

Hi.

I thought I'd tell you folks about this hack I've been using for a few
years. I use fvwm because it doesn't force me to make undue use of the mouse.
I've gone a few steps further and wrote this program which maps each quadrant
of the screen to the keys on the keypad. Pressing a keypad key warps the
pointer to the most representative window in that quadrant of the screen.

For example, pressing KP_7 warps the pointer to the most salient window of
the upper left of the screen. Pressing KP_3, warps the point to the window
in the lower right corner of the screen. The program is simple and is
documented at the top of the source:

   http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~ali/wpointer.cc

Hope you find it as useful as I have.
Enjoy!

 Ali.

I had the same problem  trying to get the 2.4.15 and 2.4.14 on RHL 8.0.
Apparently seems there is a problem with the Modules installed with the
above releases; I made both versions working installing the rpm
packages (and not the source codes) and giving in the .fvwm2rc config
file the right path of the modules which is

ModulePath /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.4.14/
PixmapPath /usr/share/icons/mini/
IconPath   /usr/share/icons

or

ModulePath /usr/libexec/fvwm/2.4.14/
PixmapPath /usr/share/icons/mini/
IconPath   /usr/share/icons

(the first path works with my desktop while the second
one with the laptop: I have no idea why the same version of fvwm
installs the Modules in different directories ???)

I can't change the background color yet (which is black!) !!!!
Does someone know how to do it ???


Cheers :-)

I guess this isn't entirely a FVWM problem, but I suspect the
answer involves FVWM, so I'll ask anyway....

Every so often, I lose my mouse.

As in: I start at the screen and can't see the pointer.  I have
to swish it and watch the focus move between windows until
I spot it.  I'm prety sure it was there all the time, but just too
inconspicuous to see.

This seems to be a very general X problem, and indeed Google has
turned up a "HOWTO" that talks about generating my own cursor font.
But unfortunately it is so old the links out of it to the relevant
software and configuration files have died of old age.

I've seen someone else trying to solve the same problem by binding a
key to make a window pop up under the mouse pointer.

Does anyone else have this problem?  How do you solve it?

Robert.

For being able to spot the pointer on the root, I've used xaniroc.
It works well on Sun workstations, but I've had mixed results with
XFree.

Hello,

I have a problem with wine - perhaps fvwm can solve it...

When I open "cool edit" (the best sound editor - unfortunately nothing
in the linux world compares to it) and start a longer calculation, I get
a little progress window. The problem is, that I can not move the
window, it stays allways on top and it is sticky on all screens :(

When I run xwininfo on the window, I get this info:
xwininfo: Window id: 0x1a000ee ""

  Absolute upper-left X:  615
  Absolute upper-left Y:  533
  Relative upper-left X:  615
  Relative upper-left Y:  533
  Width: 370
  Height: 134
  Depth: 24
  Visual Class: TrueColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOutput
  Colormap: 0xc00001 (not installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: yes
  Map State: IsViewable
  Override Redirect State: yes
  Corners:  +615+533  -1639+533  -1639-533  +615-533
  -geometry 370x134+615+533

Is there any way to give this window a "normal" behaviour ?
The program versions are:

||/ Name           Version        Beschreibung

Hello,

I use  "TitleStyle  RightJustified" for my aterm windows. I set the
window title to the actual directory, so that I have more room in the
window.

Now when I have really long paths and thus really long window titles,
the end of the title is cut off in spite of the "TitleStyle". I thought,
in the RightJustified mode, text would be cut off on the left side...

Am I doing something wrong or is this fvwms fault ?

Find this in your ~/.wine/config and change the N to a Y.

; Allow the window manager to manage created windows
"Managed" = "N"

This window ask to be not managed by the window manager and
so the situation you describe is normal.
You may try:

BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged

but this can leads to some pbs with some other override redirect
window (as tips window in the pager). Maybe, you have to ask
wine developers: why such a window is override redirect?

I have upgraded my Debian system with Gnome 2.2 version. Also I have downloaded
the Fvwm 2.4.15 source.  After compiling and installing the newer fvwm2 I logged
into Debian via GDM.  My .xsession invokes gnome-panel before 'exec fvwm2'.
This however is not happening.  Fvwm starts fine. Why am I not seeing the
Gnome panel?

When I invoke Gnome panel from command line, the panel docks only to the first
desktop.  When I switch to other desktops, the panel does not stick along.

The following is my config.h for my fvwm source.  Is there something that I
am missing that causes this behaviour?

Thank you.

I am trying to compile new binaries for version 2.5.5 on my system.
There are 2 compile options listed in "cofifgure --help"
	--with-x
	--with-gnome

What do these options do?  The "--with-x" should be turned on by default since
fvwm runs in X.  The gnome option can be turned on/off based on the users
discretion to use Gnome.  What is the purpose of "--with-x" option?

The with-x option is generated by autoconf from the fvwm configure.in file.
I don't see any way to suppress it.

I am trying to install Fvwm-Themes package along with Fvwm 2.5.5
The compilation works fine.  When I try to install this is the message I am
getting before it fails:

-----------------
convert  (update)  images in /usr/share/pixmaps
into 16x16 xpm images in /usr/share/fvwm/tr-images/16x16-gnome
Create symbolic link
if test "yes" = "yes"; then \
        /usr/bin/fvwm-themes-images --ft-install --kde2; \
fi
Check for ImageMagick ... Ok
No directory to link!
make[2]: *** [install-data-local] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm/fvwm-themes-0.6.2'
-----------------

What is the directory that this install is looking for?

Thank you in advance for any help.

Great. So is there a chance for a soon fix? Or do i have to submit this 
issue into an bug tracker of fvwm before?

FVWM 2.4.x is GNONME 1 compliant. FVWM 2.5.x "is" EWMH compliant.
EWMH is a new spec. used by KDE >= 2 and GNOME >= 2.

Hello,

is this a known issue? If i try to resize the FvwmTaskbar vertically 
(from one row size to e.g. two rows size), it disapears (and the process 
stops to exist). Is this normal?

Gert

Hello,

am i wrong or is it the fvwm's man page? In the section about libstroke 
there are the lines:

Stroke N78963314   3  R  N  FvwmForm FvwmForm-QuitVerify
Stroke N789633147  3  R  N  FvwmForm FvwmForm-QuitVerify


It's no big thing, but I think the second "3" in the stroke sequence 
should be a "2". This is a little bit confusing when reading about mouse 
strokes the first time.

Thanks,

Gert

The bug occurs with a 0 byte (so empty) config, too:

* Open the "Issue FVWM commands" Console
* Type "Module FvwmTaskBar"
* Try to resize the taskbar
=> killed

I've committed a fix for this in the 2.5.x branch.
Let me know if you can test it.
If the fix seems OK, I'll put it in the 2.4.x branch too.

None of these. It always cuts from the end of the string. And this is
usually ok, think about long browser titles.

It would be nice to have a configurable title format (filter) with a
powerful string manipulation on per window match, but it is not currently
available. Maybe someone (me?) will implement this after 2.6.

I suggest you to solve this with your shell. For example, with tcsh the
string "%C05" includes only 5 tail subdirectory levels in the prompt.
There are other solutions to keep CWD short in tcsh and other shells.

Mikhael.

Please be more descriptive. Which problems exactly do you see, transparent
menus? Can you post your configuration and make some screenshots?
This can't have anything to do with ModulePath.

Do you mean the same rpm install files into different directories on your
machines? This is impossible. Probably you have several fvwm installations
on the same machine. Try "rpm -ql fvwm | less" to see the file locations.

Please, remove your ModulePath line completely. Modules will likely to
function improperly if you have this line in your fvwm2rc. fvwm binary
knows where its modules sit without any additional help.

Please also remove PixmapPath and IconPath lines. Use ImagePath instead.
It is generally a good idea to take a look at your X output, you will see
some error messages about your fvwm2rc.

> I can't change the background color yet (which is black!) !!!!

Try: "xsetroot -solid darkcyan" or "fvwm-root myimage.xpm".
You may see FVWM FAQ on the web for other suggestions.

It seems you requested to convert kde2 icons into xpm using explicit
--enable-kde2-icons, but there is some directory missing. If you really
want to know the directory that is missing, search for "No directory to
link" string in bin/fvwm-themes-images and put debug code in it, then
remake install.

This problem may be fixed in future releases, maybe --enable-kde2-icons
will be removed, since fvwm-2.5.x supports png directly.

Mikhael.

You can't currently disable resizing if you use Resize, but you can
disable resizing if you use MyResize (or MyMove):

  AddToFunc MyResize
  + I ThisWindow (!Maximized) Resize

Hello,

after checking the man page, the FAQ and trying to search the web (it's 
difficult to search for this topic "fvwm window key modifier" that 
results in many fvwmrc files) i ask you:

Is it possible to use the following keys as modifiers?

* left window
* (right) Alt Gr
* right window
* menu
* right control as other key as left control (the same for shift)?

Especially the first key would be important for me, because i would like 
to control *window* behaviour by the (left-)window key and do 
desktop/page controlling via ALT-CTRL. (only ALT or only CTRL is to 
critical, as i think, because they are used by applications often)

Thanks,

Gert

Ok, unclutter looks ok, but the "-keystroke" parameter does not work 
here, as mentioned in unclutter's man page. And i do not understand what 
the man page tells me about an XTest-Extension.

So i ask myself if it was not possible to do mouse blanking on a key 
event with fvwm (perhaps with FvwmEvent)? The only thing is that i have 
to find a possibility to clear and reset the mouse pointer. Maybe i 
could use the unclutter sources to implement a minimal unclutter tool 
that will be invoked by fvwm on key or mouse event.

The problem is i only have to catch the first key event after mouse 
events and the first mouse event after key events. Otherwise it would be 
very unefficient, i think.

Does anybody has an idea about this? (If not i will no longer bother you 
with this ;) )

Thank you,

Gert

Hey,

Just so you know that you're not completely offtopic.. I was interested
in this same thing a while back and I got pointed at unclutter too, but
I didn't find it totally satisfactory either.

I find it slightly amusing that for all it's many strengths there are
still a few simple things that Linux makes very difficult, like this
blanking the pointer and also auto mounting/unmounting disks (yeah, I
know about LUFS, but it has its drawbacks).

Cheers,

Andy

fvwm 2.5.5 works perfectly here with gnome2.2.
You may hav to put

Style *panel* NoTitle, NoHandles, Borderwidth 0

in your configuration.

metacity is such a poor windowmanager, fvwm is the best alternative.
I guess it's even the only one, that realy works.

If you want to hit a key and have unclutter hide the cursor, you don't need
Fvwm for that.  Modify unclutter to accept a signal and use kill -usr1 or
something like that to tell it to hide the pointer.

Fvwm doesn't have universal control of the mouse pointer, thats not the window
managers job.

On my system, the left window key is Alt_L.
I can see that with xev.

Then I do:

home> xmodmap -pm
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock      
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d),  Control_L (0x42)
mod1        Meta_L (0x40)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Alt_L (0x73)
mod5      

So it looks like the windows key is mod 4.

So to bind Maximize to Alt_L F2, I'd use:

Key F2		A	4	Maximize grow grow

Likewise for other keys.

Hi,

I'm really a big fan of FVWM and I'm really proud of my config file, but
before posting a screenshot, I will try to change the scrolling bar and
buttons.

On a modern PC with fvwm, I think the scroll bar and all things related to
buttons, boxes, etc.. look old and..ugly.

Is there a way to change it ?



Pn the other hand, I try to have very tiny taskbar but with only window of
the current viewport. Is it possible ?


And, last but not least, 

Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

doesnt work for me.  I try all I think, but my windows raises only when I
click on the title... it's a bit annoying. Anyone have the same problem ?

I use fvwm on a debian woody (stable) box. (2.4.??)

thx,

Ploum

Quoting the manpage:

The focus model can be augmented with several additional options.
ClickToFocusPassesClickOff and Click_ ToFocusPassesClick  controls  if a mouse
click to focus a window using the ClickToFocus model is sent to the application
or not.  Similarly, ClickToFocusRaisesOff and ClickToFocusRaises control if  the
window is  raised,  while  MouseFocusClickRaises  and MouseFocusClickRaisesOff
are equivalent but apply only to windows using SloppyFocus, MouseFocus and
NeverFocus.  The defaults are ClickToFocusPassesClick,  Click_ ToFocusRaises and
MouseFocusClickRaisesOff.  

So try Style * ClickToFocusRaises

Could you please send me a copy of your .fvwm2rc offlist?

Greetings,
	Thomas

Is this really needed? The last time I try GNOME2 it was not,
because GNOME ask this (via some MWM hints). Do you have

	Style * MwmDecor

(and not NoDecorHint somewhere else) in your config file? A good thing
anyway.

Where do you invoke the gnome-panel though?  I have now upgrade fvwm to version
2.5.5.  My .xsession has gnome-panel defined but it does not appear on startup.
I have to manually start it up on command line.  Is gnome-panel invoked from
the .fvwm2rc or from .xsession?

Thank you.

We don't need them resized, but take a look at the other screenshots:

http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/

We need one screenshot, and a short description of whats on the screen.
You can also include all or part of your config.
I would think you would want to make sure the screenshot shows your
menus, (they look like they have nice gradient), and at least one window titlebar
and frame.

I start my gnome2.2 after fvwm in an $XTERM, because I want to use
antialiasing for gtk1 and gtk2 programs.
libgdkxft is a very evil hack, so I have really bad problems when I
start antialiased gtk1 programs from gnome2.2

If it ist not important for you that gtk1 programs are antialiased:
- start your gnome2 normaly with metacity.
- start fvwm in an $XTERM with the parameter "-replace"
- save your session
Done.

gnome2 will now start with fvwm instead of metacity.

Klaus

You can do nothing.  Expose events are generated when parts of a
window are *exposed*, not when they are covered.  Applications
that need to redraw when the window is shrunk have to react to
the ConfigureNotify.

No, it's not an X server problem.  It's simply a bug in the
application.

You can set up FvwmEvent to call a shell script via PipeRead when
the active desk is changed.  I can't try it out right now, but you
have to do something like this:

  *FvwmEvent: new_desk PipeRead my_shell_script $d

And the shell script:

  #!/bin/sh

  # remove previous bindings
  echo Key 1 W SM -

  if [ "$1" = 1 ]; then
    echo Key 1 W SM "do this"
  else
    echo Key 1 W SM "do that"
  fi

You may have to use $$d or $$$d or ... instead of $d and may have
to quote some parts in the shell script or the *FvwmEvent: line.

No, it's not possible.  The WindowList is implemented as a menu,
and at the time being, menu mode is exclusive to all other
operations.

Hello.

Would you make the configuation files available to me.

Regards,

Romildo

PS: It would be easier if every screenshot published in the
    FVWM page have its configuration files available as
    well. Much of the time users (I, at least) would like
    try it.

Really great :)

Some questions : what is your file browser ?
how do you change the look of this program ? (flat button bar style...)

Why not use a lossless format such as PNG to save your screenshots ? Because 
with JPEG, you get a lot of artefacts (especially on screenshots, because 
they tend to be hard-edged.

Ok, i know xev...

But i am not experienced with the whole xmodmap stuff yet. With your 
description i understand the related paragraph in the man page now:

  X11 modifiers mod1 through
  mod5  are  represented  as  the  digits  '1'
  through '5'.

Perhaps this paragraph should mention the two commands "xev" and 
"xmodmap -pm", to avoid other people's questions?

Ciao and thank you again,

You are right, but i thought, because it does not depend on fvwm i do 
not want to discuss it here. But FYI: unclutter can blank the pointer 
after x idle seconds of not using the mouse (-idle x) or when pressing 
any keyboard's key (-keystroke). The keystroke version does not blank 
the pointer here => it (keystroke blanking) does not work ;) . This is 
covered in unclutter's man page (section "LIMITATIONS").

Well, perhaps i have to try to get "unclutter -keystroke" working somehow.

Ciao,

I saw this behaviour in one of the several fvwm configs that i have 
tried (maybe in the default debian fvwm config?). It does have the 
behaviour that you describe above, but without using the WindowList 
window. So you just go through all windows, raising one after another, 
when pressing alt-tab.

If have tested the todays CVS version which includes:


2003-02-16  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.telcordia.com>

* FvwmPager/x_pager.c (DispatchEvent): Fix compilation problems...



Well, the pager's behaviour is different than before, but still not 
correct. With the current version the screen does move into the same 
direction as the mouse does, but you have to move the mouse just a few 
pixels to move the screen all over the pager. So the screen does move 
much faster than the mouse pointer. It feels a little bit like an 
accelerated screen. It is very difficult to handle this.

(I hope there is nothing wrong with my fvwm installation, because i did 
not know how to install the CVS version on my debian machine correctly: 
First i did remove my own fvwm-2.5.5-package that i had installed using 
the tool 'checkinstall'. After this i again used checkinstall to install 
the CVS version.)

Thanks for the feedback.
I think your install is OK.
I'll look again.

When I started my X session only the FvwmPager appeared (although I
specified other Modules to appear in the 'InitFunction' menu;
moreover the menus were unreadable (only the windows with the background color were visible).
This happened when I untar the fvwm-2.4.14(15).tar.gz and followed the
instructions to compile and install one of these realeases of fvwm, while
everithing worked when I insatlled the fvwm-2.4.14-1.i386.rpm. Anyhow
in both cases I specified the ModulePath in the .fvwm2rc file;
please note that I had no previous version of fvwm2 installed,
since I installed on my desktop the RHL 8.0 (not upgraded from a older version),
which does not have any fvwm packages.

On my Laptop I upgraded the RHL 7.3 release with the RHL 8.0 release
and I had the same problems than above. However in this case I had the
fvwm-2.4.9 release already installed on the laptop (I simply checked with
rpm -q fvwm); I therefore removed this installation not to have confusion
with the new releases I wished to install.
To make fvwm work I did exactly the same than on my desktop except for
the different ModulePath specified in the .fvwm2rc file.
Anyway now everithing seems to work on both computers....

Ok, I'll do it and see what happens!

Ok, thanks.

      Beautifull useless design ? It's pure Art, for sure.
      Does pure Art have something to do with computer applications ?

Thanks for the description.  It led me right to the problem.
It seems to work pretty well for me now.
If you have the time, try it out and let us know if you see
anything else.

Thanks.

I'm trying to make a window not appear in the pager. Basically I'm
running an xterm that is StayOnBottom and NoTitle/NoHandles, with the
look that it is running in the root window. In order for my pager to be
useful and not totally cluttered it would be nice to keep this xterm
from appearing in the pager.

I've tried the obvious PagerSkip in the style definition to no avail.

Does anyone know of a style command that would exclude a window from the
pager (along the lines of WindowListSkip). Or if there is a better way
to get the effect I'm looking for (a terminal running in the background
for issuing commands/ checking logs etc.) any insight is greatly
appreciated.


Thanks,

AMD

Hi.

Is there any way to avoid default actions for Mouse 4 and 5 in a
manner similar to 'Key Tab A M -'. It seems that 'Mouse 4   R  A  Nop'
works, but there is always subtle difference between no action and
null-action...

In 2.5.x use the following to respect WindowListSkip in a pager:

  *FvwmPager: UseSkipList

The following should do it for you:

  Mouse 0 R N -
  Mouse 1 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot
  Mouse 2 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot
  Mouse 3 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot

I agree here, this should be the built-in default.
Actually, I would only use "Mouse 1 R A" instead of "Mouse 0 R N".

Mikhael.

Yes, the entire binding should match completely to be deleted, not less,
not more. Because the bindings are not auto-deleted even if overlapped.

Hello,

Can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong?

This is how my FvwmButtons lines look like:
*FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry   64x64+0-0
*FvwmButtons: Columns          3
*FvwmButtons: Pixmap            none
*FvwmButtons: Frame            1
*FvwmButtons: (Icon 48/mozalt.png Action 'Exec exec mozilla')
*FvwmButtons: (Icon WordEditor2.png Action 'Exec exec \
~/OpenOffice/soffice')
*FvwmButtons: (Icon Mozilla-Mail_alt.png Action 'Exec exec \
mozilla -mail')

Style FvwmButtons    NeverFocus, NoHandles, NoTitle, \
StaysOnBottom, Sticky, WindowListSkip

(all the lines are broken only for the purpose of mailing)

I have this module starting together with my Fvwm:
AddToFunc StartFunction
    + I FvwmButtons
    + I FvwmPager

Every now and then FvwmButtons won't start, I sometimes need to restart 
Fvwm in my FvwmCOnsole 3 or even 5 times to have this module visible 
(`ps' states it is running).

I bet there is something ultra simple I'm missing...

cheers
W.

I am running fvwm 2.5.5 on Debian 3.0 (woody) distribution.
When I login from GDM, my gnome-panel is starting up fine now.  The panel has
it's small pager that is different from what I configured in the .fvwm2rc

The 2 main modules in my .fvwm2rc that do not get invoked on startup are
FvwmPager and FvwmAuto.  FvwmAuto never gets activated.  The window gets the
focus (upon mouse entry) but never raises to the top.

I have added my ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc below.  Could you please tell me what I am
doing wrong? (The script is a legacy script which needs to be tweaked too.)

Thank you in advance.

# First, for the mouse in the root window

# Now the title bar buttons
# Any button in the left title-bar button gives the window ops menu

Don't set the module path with 2.5.x, its built in at compile time.

If that doesn't help, look for error messages in Fvwm's stderr.

Removing ModulePath is not making any difference.
Where do I look for  Fvwm's error message log?  I don't see any in my $HOME.

System - Debian 3.0 (Woody)

Where do I configure to capture the debug messages from the defaut window
manager?  I went and edited /etc/gdm/Sessions/fvwm file to capture stderr
messages.  I cannot find any error messages file anywhere on the system.

The /etc/gdm/Sessions/fvwm file has the following script:

#!/bin/sh
#
# /etc/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox
#
# global fluxbox session file -- used by gdm

exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/fvwm2 -debug


I added the -debug option.  I have even tried "2> $HOME/FVWM-errors" which
does not capture the messages into any file.

You need someone that uses GDM to answer that question.
Maybe its in the man page.
If you've given some kind of command line to gdm to start Fvwm,
put some redirection on it:

fvwm >/tmp/fvwm.out 2>&1

Your message came in 1 second after my last send.
Don't use -debug, I don't think it will help.
Change the exec like this:

exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/fvwm2 >/tmp/fvwm.out 2>&1

I start fvwm in ~/.xsession (using the 'Xsession' option in gdm), and 
stdout/stderr is dumped into ~/.xsession-errors.  You'll probably find 
the messages in either ~/.xsession-errors or ~/.gnome-errors.

Hope that helps,

Thank you for replying.  I think I found the minor details about GDM.  The
error messages go to $HOME/.gnome-errors
It did not matter what I put in the script file.  Probably I will tweak the
script later.

I have captured debug messages for this action only. I have 2 windows side by
side. I moved the mouse from one to the other. The focus does change but
the window does not raise.

Please let me know why the FvwmAuto is not raising the focused window.

Thank you.

Thats going to be hard to do.
I just took your config file and removed the ModulePath
statement and autoraising worked fine.

Of course I don't have the part thats read in with the
read command at the end and I'm not using debug.

I think I made some progress.  Since the original fvwm/fvwm2 were installed
using apt package manager I deleted them using apt.  Then I compiled and
installed the fvwm 2.5.5 version.  One improvement is when I start the module
"FvwmAuto 300" from my modules pop-up menu, then the AutoRaise feature works
fine.

Since I am invoking the FvwmAuto in the Init, why doesn't FvwmAuto start at
that time.  Here is my Init function:

#
# Stuff to do at start-up
#

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+                           "I" Module FvwmAudio
+                           "I" Module FvwmAuto 300
+                           "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+                           "I" Module FvwmEvent
#+                           "I" Module FvwmButtons MiniButtons
+                           "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+                           "I" Module FvwmAnimate
+                           "I" Module FvwmTheme
< Other stuff >

The same problem is true for the FvwmPager as well.

What does this mean?  Excuse my ignorance. :-)

I don't know about the pager, but FvwmAuto started from the
init function for me.
In your module menu, you are missing the delay:

AddToMenu "Module-Popup"
+ "AutoRaise"				Module FvwmAuto

I think you need the delay.

This is at the end of the file you posted:

Read .fvwmrc-config

I don't have that file.  There might be something in
that file that destroys the init function.

and in one post, you indicated that you started fvwm with
the "-debug" argument.  I didn't use that.

Wow. It is a wonderful when things work.  Feels like true enlightenment! ;-)

I found the culprit. Since my fvwm session is managed via GDM the
"InitFunction" should be called "SessionInitFunction"

AddToFunc SessionInitFunction
 + I Module FvwmAudio
 + I Module FvwmAuto 300
 + I Module FvwmCommandS
 + I Module FvwmEvent
 + I Module FvwmPager 0 0

Same is true for "SessionRestartFunction"

The world is a much happier place now. ;-) AutoRaise and Pager start as
configured.

Dan, Thanks for all the help!

Thanks for this note!  I did not see it.  I started looking at the fvwm folder
and found this message.  My debug messages were going to .gnome-errors.

I should have seen your note sooner. It would have saved me some time. :-)

If you name the quoted function above StartFunction (this is the most
correct place to start modules), you may then remove RestartFunction,
SessionInitFunction and SessionRestartFunction, and reduce InitFunction to
Exec commands only.

Please do this change, use StartFunction.

Note:  It's better to separate the options by commas:

  *FvwmButtons: (Icon 48/mozalt.png, Action 'Exec exec mozilla')
                                  ^^^

Not really important here, but should you ever add something after
"Action" you do need the comma.

The problem I saw was that the menu window was drawn with the correct 
foreground color, but the text within the menu window was never visible 
(that is what generated all of the X errors I think).

I found out, though, that the problem has something to do with the way 
redhat set up their package. I had used thier RPM spec file to generate 
new RPMS from the latest source. What I ended up doing was compiling it 
myself with minimal configuration changes (specifying prefix only). 
After doing this, everything works fine.

I'm going to try to adjust thier RPM spec file configuration to see if I 
can generate a working fvwm RPM.

Hello,

This may be the wrong place to ask this, but I have already tried the 
qt-interest list with no luck.

When using the Qt Designer application from Qt 3.1.1 (im sure the problem is 
not limited to just this Qt application) the user can "dock" and "undock" 
windows within an MDI application to what are called "dock areas".  I can 
move the windows that are currently docked in the app to other dockable 
areas, but as soon as i undock to the "desktop" (outside of Qt Designer), I 
can no longer dock them back into Qt Designer.  

Has anyone else experienced this behavior, and if so what did they do to solve 
it.  Here is the current version of fvwm I am using:

fvwm 2.5.5 compiled on Feb 10 2003 at 14:32:36
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, PNG, GNOME WM hints, EWMH hints, Shape, SM, 
Xinerama, XFT

Could the problem be that I am using a development version of fvwm?  I have 
not tried a non-development version yet.

Thanks in advance

Levi

Please don't do this. There is no any reason to continue this old "fvwm2"
naming scheme. The package and the executable are named "fvwm".

To generate a good rpm from any source tarball, just run "make rpm-dist".

Mikhael.

Hi,

Is there a way to have a sort of "mini taskbar" in fvwm ?  

I would like to have mini-icons of windows currently open in my viewport. (by
mini icons, I mean like my fvwm-button, upper left :
http://frimouvy.udev.org/config.html )

Is there a way to have this fvwm button staying always on top ?

Hope that someone understand what I mean...

Ploum

PS : I don't understand why, but my "RaiseOnClick" doesn't work at all ! :(
If someone has try my config, say me if you have the same problem !

is it a way to set a window in "real" full screen with fvwm ?  (by "real
fullscreen", I mean no more title bar or border... )

It can be useful to set a console in fullscreen on a viewport...

You can do:

Style test HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0, NoTitle

then start an xterm like this:

xterm -name test -geometry 150x60

Adjust the geometry to your font and screen size.

That will be almost full screen, but depending on the font and
the dimensions of your screen, there might be a little edge uncovered.
You might be able to use a very narrow border width to cover up the
part left exposed.

Oh, I forgot to say. It's taken from CVS but I think it applies to all 
my compilations of 2.5.6 (I can't really tell how about 2.5.5 - since I 
used to have a completely different configuration where I had some 
dockapps swallowed - I think that as soon as I got rid of the dockapps 
from FvwmButtons I started experiencing problems).

Yes, of course.  You need to add an option to the conditional
command that you use to call that function.  For example, if you
have

  Next FocusAndWarp

or

  Next (some, options) FocusAndWarp

change that to

  Next (CurrentPage) FocusAndWarp

or

  Next (some, options, CurrentPage) FocusAndWarp

Check the man page sections about conditional commands for details.

Sure.  Replace "StaysOnBottom" near the end of your config with
"StaysOnTop".

Are you aware that the FvwmButtons config is riddled with syntax
errors?  This is what I get on the console:

  FvwmButtons: Illegal button option "exec"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal button option "zinf"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal Swallow option "position"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal Swallow option "top"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal Swallow option "right"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal Swallow option "delay"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal Swallow option "0"
  FvwmButtons: a button can not have an icon and a swallowed  window at
  the same time. Ignoring iconFvwmButtons: Illegal button option "exec"
  FvwmButtons: Illegal button option "psi"

Works fine with your config here.  If you can't figure it out on
your own, strip down your config to the bare minimum so that is
still does not work although you have configured it and post the
lines to the mailing list.

I correct this !  I hear a lot about fvwm console, but how it works ? (and

I try that button launch the requested program when it is not running...

It is just a text window where you can type configuration
commands.  Add it to a menu or a keystroke:

  AddToMenu RootMenu
  + FvwmConsole Module FvwmConsole
  Key c a cm Module FvwmConsole

See question 7.12 in the FAQ for more details.

Sorry for noise, but I read the FvwmTaskBar man and I'm still looking for
following options :

- Show icons only (I reduce the width of button to the 32 minimum, but it's
  still big...  )
- Don't show the start menu. (I don't need such thing)
- Have the taskbar vertical... And don't take all the screen, but only
  needed space. (an invisible taskbar when no application is launched !)

Thx

PS: perhaps fvwmTaskBar is not the best way of doing what I want...

I don't think the taskbar can do either of this.  You may be
better off using FvwmIconMan of FvwmWinList.

Ok, forget all I say about taskbar !  IconMan is really what I want ! (Fvwm
is really the best software I ever seen ! If you want it, look, it's in
FVWM... Is fvwm doing some coffee ?)

I have a tiny problem : when no window is launched, my iconMan is an ugly
box with large grey borders ! :(  

How to make IconMan disappear when no window is shown ?

thx...

How about making the background transparent and removing the
border?

  colorset 77 transparent
  *FvwmIconMan: *Colorset 77
  Style FvwmIconMan sticky, parentalrelativity, handlewidth 0, borderwidth

If that is not good enough it becomes really tricky.

it doesn't work !  

The background become grey ( ! ) and that's all !
I must say that I don't have any border when some windows are open !  It's
only when no window are matched by the IconMan (I will send a screenshot if
you want).

What's the 'parentalrelativity' ?

I forgot to mention that you have to have 2.5.5 for this to work.

A funny name for the fact that a transparent colour set is used
;-)  X calls it "ParentRelatve" internally, but that term should
never have made it into the fvwm interface.  "Transparency" would
have been a better name.

Hi FVWMers!
I have a problem with mplayer. Always I tell mplayer to go fullscreen it changes
his layer from 4 to 10 ... I don't like this. Is there a way to tell FVWM to
forbid mplayer to change its layer?

I tried the following which doesn't work.

Style "MPlayer" BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, Layer 4

It looks like gvim changes its name after its created.
Try using "Gvim" instead.

Thanks that fixes the problem in the first way. Would you please tell me how you
retrieved the name?

I have still a problem with gvim using the fullscreen command but I guess that
this isn't a problem fvwm can fix:

Gvim becomes fullscreen but there stays a gray unused area:

http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sithglan/gvim1.png

If I resize gvim manually to fullscreen the gray unused area is gone:

I will try to compile 2.5.5 this week-end... :)  (my sarge only apt-get
2.4.16 )

Anyone have a detailled how-to for installing fvwm 2.5.5 under debian sarge
?
(if not, I will try it...)

Here is the output of xwindow for a gvim window:

home> xwininfo -size

xwininfo: Please select the window about which you
          would like information by clicking the
          mouse in that window.

xwininfo: Window id: 0x1c0007a "[No file] + - GVIM"

  Normal window size hints:
      Program supplied minimum size: 104 by 89
      Program supplied base size: 20 by 61
      Program supplied x resize increment: 7
      Program supplied y resize increment: 14
      Program supplied minimum size in resize increments: 14 by 6
      Program supplied base size in resize increments:  2 by 4
  No zoom window size hints defined


Notice the resize increments.
Its the remainders that are not getting covered.

Sorry, right now I can't seem to locate any movie file to test anything.
I do notice that the mplayer man page says to try 7 different -fsmode
values.

Thanks for your support. It isn't that critical. I put a 2.6 M file for you on 

http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sithglan/sqrat_steckt_fest.avi

My mplayer manpages says:

-fsmode-dontuse <0-31> (OBSOLETE) (use -fs option)
      Try this option if you still experience fullscreen problems.

Greetings,
	Thomas

I can not follow you. You said that I can only resize a window by 14x6
factors. Is that right? If I resize the window to fullscreen the gray area is
the remaining? But why does it work when I do it manually after the application
started up using Ctrl ALT F [1]. Even if I start gvim using the auto fullscreen
stuff and press twice CTRL ALT F the gray area turns into a usable area.

[1] Using CTRL ALT F to go fullscreen.

I don't have the necessary w32 codecs.  (Its on my list of things to
deal with someday.)  I found that gmplayer will go fullscreen into
layer 10 without a movie.

You could make the default layer 10:

DefaultLayers 8 10 12

You could set up a key binding:

key f12 w s Layer 0 4

I think maximize is using the resize increments and manual resize
isn't.  I don't know why.  I'll try to check a little more, but
maybe someone else on the list already has the answer.

Hrm. I used both times Maximise (one time called from FvwmEvent, the other time
called by my hotkey). I think that the problem is that the Maximize event from
FvwmEvent is to early for Gvim to handle.

Thanks for your help. You helped me a lot today improving my .fvwm2rc :-)

You don't need the w32 codes. Get a actual mplayer version instead. :-)

That works. Thanks.

I already have a hotkey for that but it is anoying to press it each time. :-)

Thank you again :-)

I have also a problem with xterm (it does not catch the resize command on a
faster machine). So I did the following which solves the problem with gvim and
xterm. It is very ugly but it works. Maybe someone else has a better idea.

(I added the + I Piperead "ls -al / &> /dev/null" which delays the the resize
event)

DestroyFunc AddWindow
AddToFunc   AddWindow
	+ I Piperead "ls -al / &> /dev/null"
	+ I WindowId $0 ("MAINscreen")    FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("LOCALscreen")   FullScreen

Hello,

i have the following command in my fvwm2.5 config:

Mouse 3 W 4 resize


This works fine. When pressing the left window key and the right mouse 
button on a window, i can resize the window.

The thing that i do not like is, that i still have to move the mouse 
pointer to the edge or corner of the window. This edge/corner is then 
grapped by the mouse and i can resize the window. It would be much more 
comfortable if automatically *the* corner of the window is chosen to 
resize the window, that is *nearest* to the mouse pointer. Moving the 
mouse after the LeftWindowKey-Button3-Click will then move this corner.
(If i am not wrong, this is done by windowmaker this way.)

Is this possible in fvwm, too?

(Maybe by warping the pointer to the nearest corner and after releasing 
the key warping it back to the initial position? But i would like it 
most without mouse pointer warping.)

Thanks,

Gert

I am not sure, if i understand you right: You want the focused window to 
have a green title, but it is #ce8200?

> 	AddToDecor CDEDecor

The fvwm man page says that the decor-options are all deprecated. So you 
might try it without this? Just write

TitleStyle ActiveUp Solid green

> -->	+ TitleStyle ActiveUp Solid green

> -->	Style *         HilightBack #ce8200

As i understand these two options, they are doing the same, aren't they? 
So you overwrite the first color by the second?

Please correct me, if i am wrong. I am experimenting with these options 
for the first time at the moment.

Gert

mmm, well, i'll try to explain it better. It's dificult :)

this configuration file was for 2.4.14 version, and it working for 2.5.5
version.

the thing that i want to do is (if it's posible):

first, i'm think that you are wrong because,
Style* HilightBack #ce8200
change the background color of a window (completly, buttonbar
titlebar...), a window that is focused. (is it said in english correct? :) )

and if you add this line before:
AddToDecor CDEDecor
...
+ TitleStyle ActiveUp Solid green
...

then, the window has the first color (#ce8200), and the titlebar has the
second color but, it is my cuestion, why i can't to watch the title
button completely drawed with green color?

i think that i don't make it well.

i have put 2 screenshots in my server (anonymous ftp), please, download
it and you'll understand me better. ftp://isis.no-ip.org/pub

If I do "CC=cc ./configure" with 2.5.5 I get an error but this still
works with 2.4.15.

configure: error: "
configure is not able to compile programs with warnings.  Please
remove all offending options like -Werror from the CFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS variables and run configure again."

The problem is that 2.5.5 was created with
autoconf 2.53 where 2.4.15 used something earlier.

The nightly snapshots are generated with 2.13,
so they should work fine.

Will you contact the autoconf developers?

If you know what is the problem it might be much better if you contact
them.

I don't really understand the ins and outs.

This is the code:

#include <stdio.h>
#ifdef F77_DUMMY_MAIN
#  ifdef __cplusplus
     extern "C"
#  endif
   int F77_DUMMY_MAIN() { return 1; }
#endif
int
main ()
{
int warn(void) {
  int i; static j; int *p; char *c;
  switch (*p = p = *c) { case 0: printf("%Q", c, p); }
  *c = &i; c = p;
  while (1 || (unsigned int)3 >= 0 || ((int)-1) == ((unsigned int)1));
  return; }
  ;
  return 0;
}


I think they want it to generate a warning.
It does with gcc.
With forte 6.2 on my Solaris 8 machine, it generates an error:

fork> cc x.c 
"x.c", line 11: syntax error before or at: {

Line 11 is:

int warn(void) {

I really don't know what that is.
It looks like a function within a function.
Thats what gcc seems to treat it as:

fork> gcc x.c 
x.c: In function `warn':
x.c:13: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
x.c:13: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
x.c:14: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
x.c:14: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type

Maybe someone else on the list can clarify.

OK, I can reproduce this.  I haven't looked for the cause, yet.

This I don't see.  On a 3x3 desktop, I have mozilla on one
page.  It slows down a little there, but not terribly.
I've got 1.2b.

I think you sent this last response directly to me.
Don't forget to respond to the fvwm list.

After a little experimentation and research, it seems that nested 
functions are forbidden by ISO C but allowed by ANSI (resulting in 
functions with limited scope.)  gcc will generate a warning about the 
nested function if you compile with -pedantic; Forte is notorious for 
being pedantic all the time ;)

Anyway, the actual test is defined in configure.in:

dnl catch -Werror and similar options when running configure
AC_TRY_COMPILE([#include <stdio.h>],
[int warn(void) {
   int i; static j; int *p; char *c;
   switch (*p = p = *c) { case 0: printf("%Q", c, p); }
   *c = &i; c = p;
   while (1 || (unsigned int)3 >= 0 || ((int)-1) == ((unsigned int)1));
   return; }], , AC_MSG_ERROR("
configure is not able to compile programs with warnings.  Please
remove all offending options like -Werror from the CFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS variables and run configure again."))

According to the autoconf manual, only the function body is supposed to 
be passed as the second argument--the function declaration itself ('int 
warn(void) {') should be dropped, and that will hopefully fix the 
problem.  I don't have a Solaris box to test that on, though.

OK, I sent some mail to the autoconf folks.
I'll keep you posted.
I see the same problem with autoconf 2.57.

Thanks Ben.

Guess I've been fooled by configure again.

Not sure where you get this: no C standard I've ever seen (ANSI or ISO)
has ever allowed nested function definitions.

There is a GCC-specific extension that allows them; I don't know which,
if any, other compilers might also provide this extension.

Oh that rude autoconf, behaving exactly as described in its manual yet

:)


In this case you actually got fooled by GCC, which has this
super-advanced extension that made what is unquestionably a syntax error
in any standard compiler, only a warning in GCC.  The moral of the story
is that when it comes to portability, autoconf is no panacea and no
substitute for actually trying it on lots of different systems and with
lots of different compilers.  At least two of each, anyway :).

I know that can be difficult these days where GCC is so prevalent and
most anything else costs $$...

I'm going to guess you had something to do with the manual.

 :)

I just read the description at:

http://www.gnu.org/manual/autoconf/html_mono/autoconf.html

and I understand it now, but I'm sure it didn't sink in
the first time.  Unlike the gnumake manual, (which is great),
there's no example.

I didn't know about GCC, but my bigger problem was
I thought the code was coming
from autoconf.  When I went looking for the code in configure.in
I was searching for the f77 part of the code.  Since its not in
stuff generated by autoconf 2.13, I guessed the whole test was
coming from autoconf.

I know, my understanding of autoconf macros is abysmal,
but I think I'm improving.

I think different versions of autoconf is an issue too.
2.57 is complaining about our input files, but it seems to work.

I just updated the notes I keep about preparing releases to
tell myself to do a compile with Sun's compiler before release.
Seems like a good idea with gcc having weird extensions.


Thanks.

You can use vectors or pixmaps for any titlebar button except the
button you designate as the mini-icon.

I don't know what RightMain is.

Well, certainly i am not sure if it is really refreshing, because i 
cannot see it when not currently shown on the screen. But this is the 
only explanation i have why the pagers becomes so very slow. (When 
moving around the mouse pointer a lot (perhaps 3 full cicles over all 
outer pages) it takes about 3 or 5 seconds until the pager has finished 
the screen-moving. In the meantime you can watch the screen moving 
slowly on the former mouse-move-path.

here: on a 3x3 desktop, mozilla 1.3b (did you mean this, or 1.2.1?)

One milisecond after pressing the send-button i recognized that i did 
forget to set the TO-address correct. Wouldn't it be a good idea to 
automatically set the REPLY-TO-field to fvwm@fvwm.org in the mailinglist?

btw: This is one thing that i do not understand: Why are there the two 
options "ButtonStyle" and "AddButtonStyle"?

As i understand it is like the following: When using ButtonStyle you 
overwrite the old button definitions. To add some more configurations to 
this button you have to use AddButtonStyle.

But know i ask myself:

1) Why is there an "ButtonStyle Reset" when the first usage of 
"ButtonStyle" resets it anyway?

2) Why is "ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle" working without resetting 
the buttons? Why don't you have to use the "AddButtonStyle" here? Can it 
be used here?


Thanks,

Gert

Now I understand.

No, you can't use vectors to draw in the titlebar.
The vectors work in the buttons only.

thanks.
is it posible in future versions?
by example:
when my window is styck  u can see 3 horizontal lines in title, well,
i'd like to can draw in title like a button. U can put multipixmaps but
why we dont put a vector? i think that to draw a vector graph is more
primitive that put a multipixmap, it isn't? ( have i explained it well?
jeje, i can read english text perfect but the writing... i need to
practice more

Yesterday i thought the same way. But the truth is that this make things worse.
You should instead of this use the Mail-Followup-To: fvwm <fvwm@fvwm.org>. The
problem with this is that only a few eMail Clients are aware of it. And I think
mozilla isn't one of them. :-( Also have a look at Sven's signature.

Well, this is the way how i installed it under woody:

* keep the original fvwm package installed, so you still can use the 
autogenerated debian-menus, if you like to have it included in one of 
your menus:

AddToMenu StartMenu
+ Mozilla exec /opt/mozilla/mozilla

Read /etc/X11/fvwm/menudefs.hook


If you do not need this you can deinstall the packeg "fvwm".


* compile the 2.5.x source as described (configure; make)

* do not use "make install" but instead "checkinstall" (needs to be 
installed by "apt-get install checkinstall"). Change the name of the 
package to somewhat like "fvwm-selfcompiled" to not collide with the 
original name "fvwm".

* Pay attention to really start the correct new /usr/local/bin/fvwm.



Works for me.

I don't think keeping the fvwm version from packages is neccessary as
far as menus are concerned, it is enough to have:
/etc/X11/fvwm2/menudefs.hook
/etc/menu-methods/fvwm2

With these files menus for fvwm will be generated on installation of new
programs etc. For the full description of menu system in Debian see
/usr/share/doc/menu/menu.txt.gz

But because the second file (i did not check the first one) is located
in the fvwm-package it would be removed when removing the fvwm package. 
Or am i wrong?

When I click on help->about, it says 1.2b.

But, the problem isn't Mozilla, or FvwmPager.

When fvwm  executes  a  Scroll  command,  (which  is  what the   pager
generates), it's  sending  ConfigureNotify   to  windows   that aren't
visible.    (When   the  window  becomes    actually  visible  it  gets
VisibilityNotify and Expose.)

I don't think it should be doing the ConfigureNotify.

Probably yes, but this is no problem since you have a copy of this file 
in /usr/share/doc/menu/examples (this is where I got mine from). So 
unless you made changes to the fvwm2 menu-method script that came with 
Debian package you may allow dpkg remove it (well, in fact it shouldn't 
be deleted unless you use --purge option). Oh, and you can always backup 
the files residing in your /etc, can't you? :)

cheers,

Well, I once thought this was a good idea and wrote the code, but
people hated it and I backed it out again.  It is still in the
source files.  In the file move_resize.c, around line 3057 in the
current CVS code we have

  #if 0
    tx = orig->width / 10 - 1;
    ty = orig->height / 10 - 1;
  #else
    tx = 0;
    ty = 0;
  #endif

Change the "#if 0" to "#if 1".

This warps the pointer to the nearest border if it is withoin 10%
of the window size from the outer inner of the border.  If you want
it even more aggressive, change the "/ 10" to "/ 3".

When you try it out, please let me hear about your experience with
that feature.  If it is useful after all, I can easily make it a
"Style" option.

Bye

Try

  Style MPlayer GnomeIgnoreHints, EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints

One of those two styles should work.  You need 2.5.x for the
EWMH... style.

No, that's not the case.  Gvim must get confused by the arriving
events.

That is probably the case.

Um, does this Chnagelog entry ring a bell?

  2002-09-18  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

	* configure.in:
	added a program that tests for -Werror option and similar; bug out of
	configure if the test program doesn't compile

We discussed this a while ago to provide a better error message
when configure is run with -Werror in the CFLAGS.  I don't
remember exactly, but I asked for a valid program with several
warnings on the list and included it in confiure.in.  That has
nothing to do with autoconf.

Hi:
I uses fvwm-2.4.13, now I use command:
xloadimage -onroot -fullscreen ~/pic/space1.jpg
to set a picture as my wallpaper.

But I want to use different wallpapers in different
desks(I have three ones), how to configure it?

Thanks

Yes, i think changes in the look or feel always have to be configurable. 
If people are used to one thing, it must not be changed without their 
agreement.

Ok, if i have time i will try this.

If i want it to grab the nearest corner in the whole window, do i have 
to set it to "/ 2"?

Should it be a Style option or a parameter to the resize-function?

I think we disliked it because it is confusing.  Even I could not
get used to it.

No, anything below "/ 3" does not work.  The code divides the
window into a grid:

  +-----+----------+-----+
  |tl   |    top   |   tr|
  |     |          |     |
  +-----+----------+-----+
  |     |          |     |
  |left |          |right|
  |     |          |     |
  +-----+----------+-----+
  |     |          |     |
  |bl   |  bottom  |   br|
  +-----+----------+-----+

With "/ 2" the sectors near the edges are covered by the
corenerpieces:

  +----------++----------+
  |tl        ||        tr|
  |          ||          |
  |          ||          |
  +==========++==========+
  |          ||          |
  |          ||          |
  |bl        ||        br|
  +----------++----------+

The code may even generate a division by zero.  I guess what you
want is roughly this:

 tl      t     tr
  +---+----+---+
  |__  \  /  __|
 l|  \__\/__/  |r
  |__/  /\  \__|
  |    /  \    |
  +---+----+---+
 bl      b     br

Should not be too hard to write.

Probably a parameter.

Dear my friends...

I just succeeded to make XWindows Kiosk with FVWM2. On
FVWM2 it runs perfectly and very easy to imlement.

My boss want the monitor of each computer is on for 24
hours (around the clock). I don't know how to do that.
Must I switch off the screen saver? But How?
Today the monitor is off every 3 minutes.

Please tell me my friends.

Thank you very much in advance.

You probably have the screen blanking feature in the X server
enabled.  Use

  $ xset s off

to turn it off.  If that does not help. look for processes named
xlock, xlockmore, xscreensaver, etc. and prevent that they are
started.

It isn't a fvwm related question. But you can disable power saving by disabling
DPMS.

This is from the manpage of my xset utility on Debian (Woody) Linux.

>      -dpms   The -dpms option disables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

so 'xset -dpms' should to the trick.

Dear Dominik...

it is still confusing for me. Could you explain more
detail which file should I edit?
Here is my "/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc":

"
prabu@patrix:/etc/X11/fvwm2> grep -n "xset*"
system.fvwm2rc
63: +   "I"     Exec xsetroot

Which "xset" should I change?

I am using SuSE Linux 8.1

Thank you very much in advance.

xset is not related to fvwm. It is a programm you can execute and add it to
your fvwm2rc init function:

For example:

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
	+ I Exec xset s off
	+ I Exec xset -dpms

Dear my friends...

I am using FVWM2 and SuSE Linux 8.1. I succeeded to
make kiosk with FVWM2. FVWM2 is perfect for kiosk.

My boss request is now to make the monitor to be
always "on". No stand by modus, no screen saver.
How can I do this? Please tell me.

Here is my "/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc":

"
prabu@patrix:/etc/X11/fvwm2> grep -n "xset*"
system.fvwm2rc
63: +   "I"     Exec xsetroot
66: +   "I"     Exec xsetroot
718: + "hard%mini.xapp.xpm%"             Exec xset c

Do I have to change "xset" ? Which "xset" should I
change?

Thank you very much in advance.

Hmmm.... and where should I put "xset -dpms" ?
Should I put it in this file :
"/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc" ?

Does it also work in SuSE 8.1?

Thank you very much, Thomas.

Hi FVWMers,
I try to disable the SelectOnRelease Feature for the Windowlist.

The following is from the Manpage:

> The SelectOnRelease option works exactly like the MenuStyle option with the same
> name, but overrides the option given in a menu style.  By default, this option
> is  set  to  the left Alt key.  To switch it off, use SelectOnRelease without a
> key name.

I tried to add the following to my .fvwm2rc but without luck.

MenuStyle WindowList SelectOnRelease

I am not sure which version is better to handle: This one or another one 
with just the corners tl, tr, bl, br. I guess you have to try it in 
"real-life" to find this out.

Will you try? :)

It's probably a matter of taste. But i think a parameter is better, 
because a window-dependend resize behaviour would be very confusing.

I guess it is confusing.  In case of the WindowList, the
WindowList command implicitly adds "SelectOnRelease Meta_L" to its
command line - unless you specify that option manually.  You have
edit ConfigFvwmDefaults and replace

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

with

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease

I think I will change that and simply put a
"SelectOnRelease Meta_L" in the defaults file.

Ic. I added the line to my config file and it works :-)

Yep ... or give a hint in the manpage. I was already in the defaults file ...
but I did not see it. :-) I asked that question years ago. And now it is finally
solved. Thnx!

Could you write a patch for the man page?  I think I am too
involved with fvwm to explain that myself.

> I was already in the defaults file ... but I did not see it. :-)

Because it's not in the defaults file but hard coded in
windowlist.c.  I had already written a patch that adds a
WindowList menu style in ConfigFvwmDefaults.  It worked exactly as
described in the man page and was easy to understand, but
unforunately the window list did not use the default menu style anymore
:-(

Sometimes I miss a message and asking twice helps.

Actually I was trying to encourage you to write it :)  I don't I

I have a TFT (Laptop), and an old 19" IBM Fixed-Freqency CRT here.
I want to start fvwm with different configurations/systemvariables,
because e.g. I don't need antialiasing on the old 19"CRT, it has
"hardware-antialiasing" :-)

how can I solve this problem?

regards

edit your startup script to fvwm -c /path/to/.yournewconfigfile or copy your new
config over your old.

... next time read the manpage.

Ehrm... I guess you didn't understand what I ment. I want to use
different configurations on each monitor. But when I start fvwm with the
command "fvwm" it starts itself twice, on both displays.
I want either to start fvwm on only one screen or tell it to use
different configurations on each display (:0.0 and :0.1).

* From the manpage:

      -s     On a multi-screen display, run fvwm only on the screen named in the
$DISPLAY environment variable or provided through the -d option. Normally, fvwm
attempts to start up on  all screens of a multi-screen display.

What do you think about a resize that works like this:

When you click "alt mouse2" and then move the mouse left, the window
grows to the left, and then if you move the mouse right without
releasing the mouse button the window grows smaller. And if your initial
mouse movement is right, the window will grow to the right, etc...

so the resize action will start immediatly upon mouse movment, without
having to touch a border first, and without warping the cursor to the
border.

do you think this would be easy to implement, or would it require some
major rewriting?

I fixed the issues in focus.c.

Maybe you should do "make -k" (keep going) so we can find all
the Forte7 issues.  I'd try it myself, but 6.2 seems to be my
latest version.

Greetings, I downloaded 'snap-20030224' and gave it a try.  FvwmAuto
core dumps on me.

  uname -a : SunOS pin 5.8 Generic_108528-15 sun4u
  gcc -v   : gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

I invoke FvwmAuto via menu as noted below,

 AddToMenu ModulesMenu
 +       "Fvwm Modules"  Title   
 +       "Animate"       Module  FvwmAnimate
 +       "AutoRaise"     Module  FvwmAuto 350
 +       "Backer"        Module  FvwmBacker

I see the following in my stderr upon invocation,

FvwmAuto: em 0, lm 0, enter 'Silent Raise', leave '[FVWM][PositiveWrite]:
<<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor from 'FvwmAuto':
- data available=Y
- terminate signal=N

Here is the coredump backtrace.

Core was generated by

I wonder if it is possible to send a 'keypress' to an application.

Say I want that F2 is always go to opera? Or say that when I press the Help
button on my keyboard  - Opera is Focused, Raised, ... and 'F2' is sent to
opera?

Greetings,
	Thomas

In general, this is almost impossible to do.  Of course keyboard
events can be sent around, but you hardly ever know which window
to send them to.  Usually some cryptic subwindow or the
application wants the event.  And there are a number of
applications that ignore keyboard input if they do not have the
focus (for example xterm).

Colorset 0 Transparent, Tint #77cbf7 30
MenuStyle * MenuColorset 0

MenuStyle * MenuColorset 0, BorderWidth 0

If you want to keep the border, but control its color
and transparency, you can use the "sh" and "hi" args to the
colorset command.

Oooh...

I like, in fvwm 2.4, that when I start mplayer in fullscreen, I don't see
my pager and my icons.. 

But in 2.5.5, they stay always on top, and this is really boring when
watching a movie !  How can I fix that ?

thx

Just a day or 2 ago we had a discussion about mplayer, you must
have missed it.

By default, mlplayer full screen asks to be put into layer 10.
You can change your default layer to 10, or you can ask Fvwm to
ignore gnome hints.

DefaultLayers 8 10 12

- or -

Style mplayer GnomeIgnoreHints

> Style mplayer GnomeIgnoreHints

This works in stable and unstable.

	Style "MPlayer" BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, GnomeIgnoreHints

And to have a chance to work while you're watching stuff you need a
'transparent' xterm :-)

Make a screenshot of your mplayer (while running in xv mode). Take a colorpicker
from gimp or so ... and use it together with this: :-)

	xterm -T bluescreen -bg \#0101FE -fg white -ls
				~~~~~~~~ -> Overlay color.

By the way. There is a little bug with mplayer and GnomeIgnoreHints: If you have
the following in your .mplayer/config ... mplayer gets fullscreen, when you're
starting it ... but you can still see the background on the edges. To get that
away simple press twice f (fullscreen -> normal and back again)

	cat .mplayer/config
	vo=xv
	fs=yes

Sorry. Dan and I wasn't reading your mail ... only the subject. :-)
I think that layers are broken in 2.5.5. So try CURRENT CVS Version ... it works
for me. MPlayer changes its layer from 4 to 10 when going fullscreen, but on
your version is stays in layer 4 because layers broken. StaysOnTop stuff is in
layer 6 per default so your pager and icons are always over your MPlayer.

To get clear about the phaenomen: Please use FvwmIdent on the mplayer and on
your pager and get the Layer for both. So you can see what is going on. - Please
tell us about.

For me my Pager is on Layer 4 but I guess your Pager is on Layer 6 and mplayer stays
on Layer 4 while going fullscreen.

Both do not work for me :(

There should be only one icon per mouse device.  Unless you
managed two configure two devices, I have no idea where the X
comes from.  Definitely not from fvwm, though.

It seems that Dan and me do not have this problem (without the
FixedPPosition style). Can you send me a minimal java program
which has this problem.

Thanks, Olivier

Hello,

I'm currently using FVWM version 2.4.15 and when I use "Maximize
90 90" the window is not only maximized but also moved to the top
left corner (position 0,0) of the screen. I would like the window
to stay at its current position when it is maximized to 90% of
the width and height of the current screen. Is there a way to
circumvent this unwanted repositioning when maximizing?

The FvwmPager manpage states that "in order to maintain an
undistorted aspect ratio, you might want to leave out either the
width or height dimension of the geometry specification". I tried
something like "*FvwmPager: Geometry x64-0+0" in order to get a
pager with a height of 64 pixels but unfortunately it didn't
work. Any ideas?

Please CC me since I'm not subscribed. Thanks in advance.

In 2.4.x or greater use:

  Resize bottomright 90 90

In 2.5.x you can do it even better by toggling the maximization flag too:

  ResizeMaximize bottomright 90 90

Without taking a look at the code, I see that without Geometry the pager
page (the smallest rectangle) is assumed to be the 1/32 size of the screen.
You may change this constant 32 using DeskTopScale. So when you leave out
one dimension it is taking as if you would not specify the geometry at all.

If my guess is right and you want to get a 4x3 <width>x<height> ratio and
specify only height, you may do the math yourself. With DesktopSize 2x2
and only one desk in a pager and a label font of 10 pixels, the page size
could be 36x27 (4x3 ratio) and the pager geometry would be 73x66-0+0
(73 = 36 * 2 + 1 separator; 66 = 27 * 2 + 1 separator + 11 label).

I don't know whether the current behaviour is what is originally intended.
But I think a good solution to this is to have a new option KeepAspect
that would force the page size to the same aspect ratio as the screen.
Patches to the cvs version are welcome.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hmm, i think the usage would be a little bit fiddly this way. IMHO it 
would be more simple to just click into the wanted area that lays 
nearest to the corner you want the window to resize at. With your method 
you certainly had the chance to resize the window at an edge or corner 
that is no even visible at the moment, but do you really need this?

I will install window maker again to test its resizing and see how 
exactly it behaves. AFAIR this was very intuitively.

It depends on how you start your X-Server:

by startx: put the line "exec /usr/local/bin/fvwm" into .xinitrc

by a display manager: put the same line into .Xsession (or .xsession?)


(important is to specify the full path; Also you can try "which fvwm" to 
see which binary is chosen without the full path; and "man fvwm" to 
check if the correct man-page (see the version number) is taken.)

This all works here automatically. But if you have problems or you are 
unsure, try to remove the original fvwm package as Wojtek Aleksander did 
mention.

Just for my understanding: What are the messages "VisibilityNotify" and 
"Expose" good for? Is it a mozilla bug that it reacts on only 
"VisibilityNotify"?

Perhaps this should be configurable as a Style somehow? Then fvwm was 
ICCCM compliant but the user can decide if this makes sense.

Well, i took a look at/on/to (please teach me, what is correct?) the 
code. Well the function is way long. And it's been a long time since i 
did write a line of C-code. And at the moment i would be happy if i only 
had the time to get into fvwm and its configuration as user. So sorry, i 
do not dare trying to implement this at the moment, even if i really 
would enjoy it.

Actually, that part of my reply was meant for the other Fvwm
developers.  I was describing the X events an off-screen program
gets on a scroll vs. the on-screen events.

Mozilla most likely repaints itself on all three events,
as it should.

I looked in the ICCCM and I don't see the relevant part.
I don't think this qualifies as moving the window.
The window is in virtual space so its not moving in real space.

I think something should be done but I'm not working on a fix
right now.  Maybe someone else will, or I might come back to it.

When an applications was partially or fully hidden and becomes
fully visible, the window gets a "VisibilityUnobscured" message.
If it was at least partially visible and becomes fully obscured,
it gets "VisibilityFullyObscured" and if it was fully visible or
fully obscured and becomes partially visible, it gets a
"VisibilityPartiallyObscured" message.

Especially, no event is sent when some parts of the window were
covered and some were not, and the window is moved so that other
parts are covered.  However, Expose events are generated for the
newly uncovered areas (unless backing store is used).

> Perhaps this should be configurable as a Style somehow? Then fvwm was

No.  First, fvwm is not involved at all in these events.  Second,
it is totally clear from any X documentation I read that
applications have to redraw in response to Expose events.  An
application using VisibilityNotify in place of Expose is simply
broken.

I find another way :  I create a link called fvwm25->fvwm in /usr/local/bin
I call this fvwm25 in .xsession !  that's useful to use with KDM.  
fvwm25 -> call fvwm 2.5.5
fvwm or fvwm2 -> call fvwm 2.4.15

Be careful.  There are some parts of fvwm you want in your PATH,
(like FvwmCommand).  Creating links or using full path names for
starting Fvwm doesn't help with that.

You could use a shell script containing something like this:

(start of fvwm25 shell script)
PATH=/myfvwm25/bin:$PATH
export PATH
exec fvwm

Note that things you start from your .xinitrc won't see this,
so if you start an xterm or emacs from your .xinitrc, it won't
run the right FvwmCommand.

Unfortunately this is impractical for me since it doesn't toggle
the maximization flag. Furthermore the values "90 90" of the
Resize-command are interpreted as a position and not the width
and height of the resized/maximized window.

I don't know about that since I don't use version 2.5.x but I
assume the values are interpreted the same way. Thus the window
is resized until the bottom right corner of the window is at a
position 90% from the left and 90% from the top of the screen.

I'd like to have something like the "growright/growdown"-option of
the "Maximize"-Function that doesn't stop when it runs into an
obstacle but keeps maximizing the window until the window has a
certain width and height, e.g. 90%, 90%.
But I gues that's not possible right now.

              Completely or partially specifies the pager windows
              location and geometry, in  standard  X11  notation.
              In  order  to maintain an undistorted aspect ratio,
              you might want to leave out  either  the  width  or
              height dimension of the geometry specification

After reading this on the manpage of FvwmPager would say the
current behaviour is probably not the behaviour that was originally
intended. So a "KeepAspect"-option would be really nice.

You want

  ResizeMaximize 90 90

without the "bottomright" argument.

Yes, that is exactly what I was asking for, thanks.

Is there a way to get this effect when maximizing only
horizontally or vertically?
"ResizeMaximize 0 90" or "ResizeMaximize 90 0" will not work
because in contrast to Maximize ResizeMaximize does not interpret
0 as the current width or height but as width or height 0.

Thanks for your explanation, Dominik.

phew... complicated... What does "obscure" mean in window manager 
context? Checking a dictionary did not return sensefull results. So, 
what is the difference between "not (fully) visible" and "(partially) 
obscured"?

All the cases that you did describe are ok to send such an event, but 
none of these cover the situation i did mean: When moving the 
pager-screen around with at everytime completely *not* showing the page 
where mozilla is opened, mozilla should not get such an event, isn't it? 
Only if a mozilla window was not (fully) visible and at one time becomes 
more visible than before, it needs to redraw and so requires such an 
event, as i understand.

But Dan allready said that this might be fixed sometime. It is certainly 
of priority C, IMO. (The only thing is that this 
mouse-button-3-scrolling in the pager did arouse my interest for fvwm, 
because it gave me a totally new feeling of a real huge virtual screen. 
But there are enough other interesting things to be found in fvwm...)

Hello,

while experimenting with virtual desktop commands I have configured the 
usual CTRL-ALT-CursorKey to move the screen to another page (GotoPage) 
and also CTRL-RighWin-ALT-CursorKey to move the currently focused window 
to a page and also go there. Therefore I use this function:

AddToFunc MoveAndGotoPage
+ I Raise
+ I MoveToPage $0 $1
+ I GotoPage $0 $1

Key Right W CM4 MoveAndGotoPage +1p +0p
...

Is this the correct way to handle this or is there a smarter way to go?


My main question is now: How to configure fvwm so that 
RightWin-CursorKey moves the focused window around without moving the 
screen?

I tried

   Key Right W 4 MoveToPage +1p +0p

but there are 2 problems:

First: After moving the window, the focus should not change to another 
window that might have been behind the recently moved window until the 
RightWin key is released. Otherwise you could not move the initially 
focused window across 2 pages.

Second: The arguments "+1p +0p" of MoveToPage are taken relative to the 
page where the screen currently is at. It has to be relative to the page 
where the currently moved window is at in this case.

Is there a solution for this?

Gert

"Note that this option does only work if the window style of the pager
window is style too."

What does this sentence mean?



"When iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional current page 
only pager."

Shouldn't this be "current desktop only pager."?

In 2.5.x all these commands Move, Resize, Maximize and their numerous
combinations accept argument(s) "keep" to achieve this.

Hello, been getting pretty heavily into Fvwm, and adding it also to my
Libretto laptop.  The laptop is slow (75 mhz) so I'm going for a mininal
of features, with a very basic Fvwm95 setup.

I wrote a small app that reads 'ppp0' which evenally should turn into a
'modem lights' app.

I noticed that I can not swallow apps directly on the FvwmTaskBar, say to
put this app next to the clock and the Mailcheck.  So I'm coursious to
look into modding the FvwmTaskBar to 'swallow' this app in that way.

I have been slowly browsing the ./fvwm-2.4.15/modules/FvwmTaskBar code,
and my question is, is there a 'doc' or maybe some 'advice' on where
exactly to start, not all -that- familiar with GUI programming but can
figure most things out.

TIA.
Jon.

The advice is to use FvwmButtons for this. Have menu or launch buttons,
swallow FvwmIconMan and any applet like your app inside FvwmButtons.

It would be more helpful if you instead of extending FvwmTaskBar decide to
extend FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan. This is a more clean way where more
people benefit.

There is an information about the fvwm to modules protocol on the web site
that you may find useful. But at this point FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan
modules need enhancements that require some X programming knowledge that
is not FVWM specific, like nicer 3d effects, balloons and so on.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There is no a "smarter" way than this.

Unfortunately I don't see a good solution for this unless ClickToFocus is
used.

You may use Move w+$[vp.width] w+$[vp.height], but unlike MoveToPage it
does not check for desktop page boundaries...

> Is there a solution for this?

Well, after some more thinking I see some solution:

  Key F5 A CS  SetEnv CURRENT_WID $$w
  Key Right A 4  WindowId $$[CURRENT_WID] Move w+$[vp.width] keep
  Key Left  A 4  WindowId $$[CURRENT_WID] Move w-$[vp.width] keep

You need first to mark a window, then move it to any direction.

Mikhael.

Another workaround/solution (assuming window being moved has
MouseFocus style & FvwmPager SloppyFocus)...

  Rest the mouse on window representation in -Pager in order to keep
  focus on the window being moved.  Then just issue the command
  sequence to move window any which way.

Hello,

  I'm running fvwm2 version 2.4.7 with the cygwin package on a windows 2000 
box.  When therein, I'd like to be able to toggle among the xterms via the 
keyboard, much like one can do with alt-tab on windows.  I see a little 
material on this in the man page, but I need to know how to map a different 
key combination to do that task since ctrl-alt is taken.  I imagine it's a 
command like: Key A M <etc.>

Can anyone help?

thanks.

It is like:

  AddToFunc MyFocusAndRaise
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 50 7p

  Key F5  A  CM  Next (XTerm) MyFocusAndRaise

where "F5" can be any keysym, like "d" or "4" or "KP_8", "A" in the second
place means anywhere ("T" means only in the window title etc.), "CM" means
Ctrl-Alt, "Next (XTerm) MyFocusAndRaise" can be any FVWM command.

See the description of "Key" and "Next" commands in the man page.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Being covered by other windows or outside the screen area so that

You need a better dictionary :-)

Fully visible      = all pixels are displayed
Fully obscured     = no pixel is visible
Partially obscured = some pixels are visible and some are not

Right.

Yes.  Expose events inform a window of newly visible areas.

It reads

  If the pager is started with the \fI-transient\fP option, the next
  time a button is released the pager is closed. Note that this
  option does only work if the window style of the pager window is
  'sticky' (see the fvwm man page). You should use the 'StaysOnTop'
  style too.

in the sources.  Some of the text was swallowed because of a
formatting error.

Yes.

Hi,=20

i just noticed that if you want to create a title bar without
buttons, you have to take care of the order of the NoButtons
directives.=20

E.g. this doesn't work:

Style 	MyStyle	NoButton 1
Style	MyStyle	NoButton 2
Style	MyStyle	NoButton 3
Style	MyStyle	NoButton 4

but this is working:

Style	MyStyle	NoButton 3
Style	MyStyle	NoButton 4
Style 	MyStyle	NoButton 1
Style	MyStyle	NoButton 2

I'm not sure if you want to call this a bug. At least it isn't
mentioned in the man page.

David

Both versions work fine for me.  Can you provide more information

This Module is planned for fvwm 3.0. You can give it a comma separated 
list auf wishes, e.g.:

Module FvwmBaker donut, "apple pie", espresso

If you want the results warm you will have to specify a hotkey.

I guess you want to play an audio clip on a desk change?
If you have a shell named "playsound", arg 1 will be the desk number:

Heres how to test it:

KillModule FvwmEvent
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent:*
*FvwmEvent: PassID
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Exec
*FvwmEvent: new_desk playsound
Module FvwmEvent

Put FvwmEvent in your StartFunction when done.

Okay next try. I know this is offtopic. But I am looking for a programm which
popus in the middle of the screen on StayOnTop Layer and doesn't get the focus,
has a border, title, background, (*only the text*) or whatever and gives one
line of text like:

'You have new eMail.' or 'Go home' or 'Page 1' or 'whatever'.

I know this has nothing todo with fvwm. I searched for such a programm but could
not find one. Something like Windowmaker uses to anounce his workspace when
switching. Maybe someone has an idead.

Hi there, just downloaded 'snap-20030228' and I'm noticing extra
slight delays in focus specifically on FvwmWinList and FvwmPager.
Seems like the window first gets focus and then the modules get
its indication (its like a 2-step process and the delay is rather
noticeable - wasn't there before).

Not sure what to send in terms of debug or how to go about things,
but I thought I'd mention it.

Maybe this will help -- have FvwmWinList running, start an xterm
and maximize it on a particular desk/page then enter that xterm.
Now switch page and/or desk and notice how WinList gets refreshed
(notice the delay ?).  Everything gets displayed, then its WinList's
turn (again, its delayed and its rather noticeable).

BTW: was using 'snap-20021218' before.

PS: please CC replies.

Regards,

 - Nadim

There is sometimes a delay before the binary gets moved in place.
Try later, or use a snapshot.

PS: I have a really hard time reading mail when half of the
question is in the subject line but missing from the body.

Hrmpf. I always put the hole mail into the subject and add a reference to the
subject in the body: subject!  :-)

I recycled some code from the XMMS Titlefader[1] plugin Code. Now I have the thing
I always wanted[1]. It isn't that stable but useable at least. Give it a try but
don't expect to much and tell me about it. I simple used the routine provided by
XMMS Titlefadder and put a little main.cc around it. It doesn't do any error
checking and all and you have to start it with at least one argument (the other
arguments get ignored).

	./fader "Way to easy"

Let me know what you think about it. If you find a better alternative, please
let me know. You can *download* it from my place[2].

Argh ! I was proud of my work with  2.5.5 (I don't compile my window manger
every day)..  But I will try that !

I will thanx all the developpers !  Fvwm is really great (but a little
geek-oriented, I like that ;) ).  
Fvwm is one of the oldest WM, but his development is still really active...
What I say :
"If you can imagine it, Fvwm can do it !"

Many thx to the team and to the list for help...

Just write *one time* a script and reuse it whenever you have to recompile fvwm.

Hi

I searched the past year's worth of archive, which 
at best pointed me to the manpage, and tried
every combination out of the manpage, but no luck.

I say all this as it probably is the next best thing
to an FAQ.

What I want is a 1 column, 4 row FvwmButtons, where
(counting from top to bottom), the sizes are

68x68
68x68
68x252
68x68

I have tried all combinations I could think of 
of specifying the app's -geometry, geometry as 
an option on the Button, Size, etc. 

So far I have gotten at best either a Buttons
with all parts 68x68, or one with all parts 68x252.

Here is a chunk of .fvwm2rc which does the latter

*MailBoxGeometry -1+1
*MailBoxBack black
*MailBoxColumns 1 
*MailBox: (Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "xeyes" \
                `Exec exec xeyes -geometry 68x68`)

*MailBox: (Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "xclock" \
                `Exec exec xclock -bg black -fg turquoise  -geometry 68x68 \
                -hd turquoise -hl turquoise -padding 0 -update 1`)

*MailBox: (Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "gkrellm" \
                `Exec exec gkrellm` Size 68 252)

*MailBox: (Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "kbiff" \
                `Exec exec kbiff -profile Inbox`)



Note that changing the first line to
*MailBoxGeometry 68x456-1+1

Only squishes the 3rd app, making every button 
114 tall.

Clear 1 column (or 1 row) examples, even if they are complicated
are most welcome and appreciated.

Thanks in advance, and for the good work.

Michael

I'm slow, but I rarely forget completely.
(I didn't forget this time.)
The screenshot should appear in an hour or less.

I just compiled fvwm 2.5.6 and now my pager is gone!

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmPager' in
ModulePath '/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.5.6'

What can I do?

Its working for me.

Take a look for /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.5.6/FvwmPager,
is that were its supposed to be?  Is it there?

Are you out of space?

Redo the make install step.  Look for problems.

Yes, it is there. When I tried to copy it there by hand I saw, that it

Well, if its there, and marked executable, I'm not sure.
How about trying to run it from the command line, it should print:

FvwmPager Version 2.5.6 should only be executed by fvwm!
