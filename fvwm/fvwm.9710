Hi
How do you use AddButtonStyle

I got an error like
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/local/public/bin/ 
AddButtonStyle

How would you handle it?

AddButtonStyle is not a module, its an fvwm2 command.

If you have  shown us the  literal output, I  would have to guess that
you are not using fvwm 2.0.46, since in that release the message would
read like this:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'xxxxxx'
 in ModulePath '/usr/dje/fvwm-2.0.46/fvwm/'

Make sure the  fvwm2 you are running matches   your documentation.  If
that doesn't help, show us the lines in your .fvwm2rc that apply.

   I think this *may* be a good idea for some.. but not so great for
   others.  I'd hate to think that I would HAVE to make sure where I
   place my pointer so to not have FvwmPager change desks on me!!!

   If such a "feature" is ever implemented could the implementer please
   make sure and have an option to *disable* this "feature" from the
   .fvwm2rc file (or even at run time).

   Anyone else with any comments on this?

   Just my 2 cents ...

My idea is to be able to have a "balloon" popup with the name of the
tool or action this button would activate when it received  focus.

This idea came from the way I have my FvwmButtons set up. I have one
button split into three rows of three columns.  These buttons are very
small and can just fit a mini pixmap so no title will fit.

I have read about a "balloon" popup for the pager, would something like
this be possible for the FvwmButtons module?

Thank You

Just to underline we are many ... :-)

In my TODO list for fvwm (which I was never able to revisit due to
lack of time, of course :-) one will find:

1) TWO button arrays
TaskBar may have TWO button areas. 
One for full buttons, other for mini-icons as in a tray

Indicating what goes in tray might be done with some Style command
or with a specific FvwmTaskBar property

2) efficiency
Ask people what's more efficient: taskbar, or a combination of 
	fvwmbuttons and fvwmIconMan

3) desk module
a desk like module. With shortcut icons and maybe with trash and filemanager

4) folder buttons
Hack the fvwmButtons for including the ability to do folders
Maybe it will need some clearing before.

5) menus do styles
make menus understand style mini-icons

6) buttons
titlebar functionality add a minimize/restart/stop
functionality to fvwmbuttons, with animation (as in warf)


Interested? Thanks for your attention, see you all again not too late :-)

Of course, I read my message only after I sent it, so now I see it
wasn't there my desire to add tooltips to fvwmbuttons.

More than that, I believe that putting tooltips methods in libfvwm
would be something to think about.

Have you seen KDE lately? It's wonderful. But I prefer fvwm for its
full configurability and for my better knowledge of it. And I think
fvwm could (in a matter of weeks) equal any other desk suite if:

1) we take the risk to adopt a widgets library (gtk?)

2) we develop a series of good and fancy modules for (on the fly)
configuration tasks, desktop functionality (shortcuts and other
cosmetic things) and drag and drop.

3) we continue to strip out of the main code features which are better
fit in modules (borders definitions, window operations - as shade -
etc.)

Unfortunately I don't think this have good chances to happen in a
short delay, because development in fvwm has visibly reduced steam
pressure compared to two or three years ago. Hey, this is more a
self-critic message, got it? :-)

Have you seen the fOX project? :-) fOX.unixville.com is the home... check
it out... it's still growing :-) The fOX project is based around the
Xclass `95 C++ X11 Toolkit (which lets you create widgets that look
identical to 95 ones). I'd like to see a new window manager come out for
the project, and I don't necessarily want it to look like 95 (actually, I
DON'T want it to look like 95 :) ... I also think it might be a good idea
to start a new window manager from scratch with a new perspective on
things. 

If you'd like more info on the fOX project, or you'd like to participate,
let me know.

Hi folks

I've noticed that one question which gets asked here quite a lot is:
"How do I get my xterm to show {username, hostname, current directory}
in the titlebar?"

Now, this isn't a window manager issue, but many people don't know that.
I created a mini FAQ for this for my local users, but others may be
interested, so here's the URL:

  http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/computing/xterm_title.html

I give solutions for several shells. If anyone has any better methods,
solutions for shells I've not mentioned, or escape sequences for
other terminal types, let me know and I'll include them. The more
comprehensive this is, the more useful it may be.

Cheers
Ric

A question to the Sun users:

We recently upgraded to Solaris 2.5.1 (did not use any of the old Sun OS
stuff) and compiled FVWM 1.24r and 2.0.45 on them.

We are using two types of Sun Key boards, the enhanced type (with extra 4
arrow keys and 6 Inset,Home etc. keys) and the non-enhanced type (using num
pad as arrows and Home-PgUp etc.)  

 On the old Os (there are still a few here) both keyboards functioned fine,
and the arrows on Num pad where active.

 On the solaris upgraded machines, when fvwm (1.24r) or fvwm2 (2.0.45) is run
the xterm shows X for every arrow key pressed on the Num pad keys (on the
none-enhanced keyboards), but work fine with the enhanced keyboards (we use
tcsh and uparrow suppose to print the previous command).

the kbd -t command reports: Type 4 Sun keyboard
for both keyboards. How and where could I modify the X settings for
keyboard keys (specially arrows etc.).

sincerely,
roozbeh

I have seen a fvwm2 titlebar design somewhere that uses a vertical
gradient and in addition 3 or four evenly spaced lines overlayed on
that.  It gives a sort of ``knurled'' look.

I think I understand the vector drawing facility, but titlebars can
vary dynamically in length, so fixed coordinates won't work.

Does anyone know how to produce those lines?

I think I can guess.  What you may have seen is the combination of a
sticky window and a vertical gradient.  Maybe.  Anyway, vertical gradients
you do by using something like

TitleStyle VGradient 16 3 Red 20 Blue 30 Black 50 Grey

This is pulled directly from the result of "man fvwm2".  I don't really
get this gradient business 'cause I'm not sure how it works along with the
HilightColor setting and the ForeColor and BackColor style settings.  No
experience.

Which leads me to a similar question.  How do you use "TitleStyle
VGradient" so that you get one gradient for unfocused windows and another
for focused windows?

G.F.

:) 

joe /usr/src/fvwm-2.00.xx/fvwm/borders.c

search for: STICKY =>

  /* now, draw lines in title bar if it's a sticky window */
->  /*if(t->flags & STICKY)*/
  if(1)

comment this out like i here (/*) any all windows will have
'sticky-style'.

> I think I understand the vector drawing facility, but titlebars can

they aren't fixed.. 

sticky looks great with:

TitleStyle LeftJustified ActiveUp (HGradient 2048 2 LightBlue 45 Red 55
Green -- flat)

or:

TitleStyle ActiveUp (HGradient 2048 2 gray76 45 #f4be9ef9ffff 55 gray76
-- flat)
TitleStyle ActiveUp (HGradient 2048 2 gray76 45 #00006F 55 gray76 --
flat)

+ TitleStyle Height 16

ps: when you don't want to patch then use a Pixmap in the TitleBar:

HilightColor white grey67
TitleStyle centered
TitleStyle ActiveUp TiledPixmap active2.xpm -- flat
TitleStyle InActive TiledPixmap inactive.xpm -- flat
TitleStyle ActiveDown TiledPixmap active2.xpm -- flat
BorderStyle  -- HiddenHandles NoInset
Style "*" MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, MWMBorder, MWMButtons

You're absolutely right.  I didn't realize that since I don,t use
sticky windows much, and the ones that I do use don't have a titlebar.

So, does anyone know if I can have those lines for ``unsticky'' windows?

> Which leads me to a similar question.  How do you use "TitleStyle

In the appropriate ``AddToDecor'' define something like this:
+ TitleStyle Inactive (VGradient 32 LightGoldenRod Black -- Raised)
+ TitleStyle ActiveUp (VGradient 32 LightGoldenRod Black -- Sunk)
+ TitleStyle ActiveDown (VGradient 32 Black LightGoldenRod -- Flat)

To change between ``convex'' and ``concave'' look, swap the colors.

While the escape sequence thingy is a Good Thing (tm) for xterm

Back when I used to use gwm I used its ability to change window titles
on the fly a lot: you could double click the window title and you were
then able to input a new title.  Very useful.  WIBNI one could do this
with fvwm, too?

[*] For those who don't use these programs: they have a window title
of "Ghostview 1.5" or suchlike -- not very useful in an FvwmIconMan if
you have a half dozen of them open and want to find the one that you
want to look at.

A while back I noticed someone talking about getting rid of the top borders
and stretching the titlebar to fit the width of the window. Is there a
patch for this? It seems sensible since you don't really need the top
resize buttons anyhow, and for people (like me) who don't run in
16000x12000 pixel resolutions, it might even save some screen space :) I
think it would look a lot cooler too.

I've managed to change the source to alter the highlight & shadow colors to
white & black, but that's about it. I tried to fool with the borders but I
can't make sense of most of it--I need to figure out how it works.

But I thought I'd ask since other users have mentioned the same thing
before.

Well, you lucked out, since I forgot how I did it myself I had to take a look.
All you have to do is this:

edit colors.c

in function GetShadow:
change the bg_color.red = r
                   bg_color.green = g
                   bg_color_blue = b
to
                   bg_color.red = 0
                   bg_color.green = 0
                   bg_color.blue = 0

or whatever RGB values you want.

Now do the same in function GetHilite. Now the colors are hardcoded in and will
always override the automatically generated ones.

Then type 'make' (there's no need to make clean), and copy the new fvwm2 file
where your old one was. Have fun-

-Joe

Hi,

When using (active?)placement of windows they are automatically placed 
in the first fitting position searched from left-right, top-bottom. 
How do I change this to be right-left,top-bottom?

Hi,

I have three .fvwm2rc's in three different places which I 
try to keep in sync to get a similar environment in all places.
This is no big deal apart from updating the paths at the to of 
the .rc file. The question is how do I make AddToMenu entry which only
lick-in if the appropriate binary exist?

E.g. I'd like to do something like...

if -exist `which netscape` then
 AddToMenu netscape netscape bla bla...
end

I don't know, but I have a fvwm95 setup which does this.  I think it's called 
The Next Level, or something.  A quick search should find it.  It uses fvwm95, 
but I don't think the technique relies on anything that's not in core fvwm2; I 
suspect the trick is in using m4.

Hi,

   Well just installed fvwm2 (2.0.46). The make and install went great.
Copied one of the samply fvwm2rc's to my home directory and did the
normal startx.   I got a grey blank screen and the only button I had
was the exit button. Once I exited I noticed several error messages.
Here is the ouput from one of the errors, which were all basically identical.

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module '(garbabe)' in ModulePath
'/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'

I had about 8 of these, and the modules are located in the
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2.   I looked through the INSTALL and FAQ
files plus tried to due a pull on the mail archives, but did not
see anything close to this. Anyone able to point me in the right
direction?  Thanks in advance...

Greg

As I get deeper into the "multiple icon boxes patch"  that I have been
working  on, I  see  that it  doesn't  really  affect  the change  you
proposed.  Besides you mentioned the icon used by FvwmIconBox, not the
built-in IconBox.

I don't   see why fvwm2  couldn't change  the   icon associated with a
window when it is notified of the changes in the class information.  I
would assume  that FvwmIconBox  is or  could be notified  of the  icon
change.

gv shows the title of the document if it is contained in the postscript
(using %%Title:).

It should be a very easy hack of the ghostview source to make it
show the filename in the title.

This is an interesting idea. It would probably be fairly straightforward
to implement a builtin ChangeWindowTitle function, and then maybe
use FvwmForm to type in the string and call the function.

Hope so.

Anything  fvwm2 finds in your  .fvwm2rc that  it doesn't understand it
tries to execute as a module.

Seems like your .fvwm2rc file has a line containing "garbabe"?

If  not, its a common  mistake to name  the fvwm config file ".fvwmrc"
instead of ".fvwm2rc".

Hello,

Is there anyway to set the color for icon label/title bar so that it is
different from the 'HilightColor' and 'Style "*" BackColor' of windows?
I searched the archive and could not find anything.

Thanks,
Scott

I agree.

Something like this should work (it does on my system):
    m4_changequote({,})
    m4_define(NETSCAPE, {/usr/local/bin/netscape})
    m4_define(NS_IS_PRESENT,
        {m4_esyscmd(if [ -x NETSCAPE ];
        then echo -ne "yes" ; else echo -ne "no" ; fi)})
    NS_IS_PRESENT
    m4_ifelse(NS_IS_PRESENT,yes,{Exec NETSCAPE})
When run with ``m4 -P AboveFile.m4'' it produces 3 blank lines and:
    yes
    Exec /usr/local/bin/netscape

Note the ``echo -ne ""''.  Without that echo produces the string
followed by a newline, and "yes" is not the same as "yes\n" when you
test in ``m4_ifelse()''.

Cheers   :-)

I have started to use FvwmM4 for some adaptive startup behaviour.
E.g. starting xterms with different fontsizes and geometries.
However, I found that all predefined macros include an extra set of
quotes.  E.g. the predefined "WIDTH" expands to "`1600'".  I find this
very undesirable since it is not possible to do arithmetic with quoted
numbers, e.g with ``m4_eval()''.  I have patched FvwmM4 for my
purposes to omit those extra quotes.

Question:  Has anybody got a big investment in FvwmM4's current
quoting behaviour or should it be changed to allow arithmetic in m4?

Or possibly: Am I missing something?

I've been using FvwmM4 with non-standard quote characters for a while
now.  Basically what i do is the following:

    m4_dnl
    m4_dnl # change to quote characters which aren't likely to be used
    m4_dnl # in `normal' combinations of characters.
    m4_dnl
    m4_changequote(`<%',`%>')
    m4_dnl
    m4_dnl # a macro to strip `standard' quotes from predefined fvwm
    m4_dnl # macros; this uses a trick of patsubst where omitting the
    m4_dnl # third argument causes matching text to be deleted from a
    m4_dnl # string.=20
    m4_dnl
    m4_define(<%stripquotes%>, <%m4_patsubst(<%$1%>, <%[`']%>)%>)
    m4_dnl
    m4_dnl # now strip the quotes from the predefined macros.
    m4_dnl
    m4_define(<%_FVWM_VERSION_%>, stripquotes(FVWM_VERSION))
    m4_define(<%_BITS_PER_RGB_%>, stripquotes(BITS_PER_RGB))
    m4_define(<%_CLASS_%>, stripquotes(CLASS))
    m4_define(<%_CLIENTHOST_%>, stripquotes(CLIENTHOST))
    m4_define(<%_COLOR_%>, stripquotes(COLOR))
    m4_define(<%_WMDIR_%>, stripquotes(FVWMDIR))
    m4_define(<%_HEIGHT_%>, stripquotes(HEIGHT))
    m4_define(<%_HOME_%>, stripquotes(HOME))
    m4_define(<%_HOSTNAME_%>, stripquotes(HOSTNAME))
    m4_define(<%_OPTIONS_%>, stripquotes(OPTIONS))
    m4_define(<%_OSTYPE_%>, stripquotes(OSTYPE))
    m4_define(<%_PLANES_%>, stripquotes(PLANES))
    m4_define(<%_RELEASE_%>, stripquotes(RELEASE))
    m4_define(<%_REVISION_%>, stripquotes(REVISION))
    m4_define(<%_SERVERHOST_%>, stripquotes(SERVERHOST))
    m4_define(<%_TWM_TYPE_%>, stripquotes(TWM_TYPE))
    m4_define(<%_USER_%>, stripquotes(USER))
    m4_define(<%_VENDOR_%>, stripquotes(VENDOR))
    m4_define(<%_VERSION_%>, stripquotes(VERSION))
    m4_define(<%_WIDTH_%>, stripquotes(WIDTH))
    m4_define(<%_X_RESOLUTION_%>, stripquotes(X_RESOLUTION))
    m4_define(<%_Y_RESOLUTION_%>, stripquotes(Y_RESOLUTION))
    m4_dnl
    m4_dnl # finally, get rid of stripquotes(), since we don't
    m4_dnl # need it anymore.
    m4_dnl
    m4_undefine(<%stripquotes%>)

The quoteless macros are surrounded by underscores; e.g. the stripped
version of `WIDTH' becomes `_WIDTH_'.

Hope that helps.  Freundliche Gr=FC=DFe aus North Carolina.

This  rather large patch   is version 1.0   of the "Icon Boxes" patch.
After applying this patch, there can be multiple Icon Boxes defined in
1 style command.  Optional Icon Grids can also be defined.

This patch does not provide for alternate Icon Box Gravities.

Since I had to  change the style parsing,  storage and retrieval,  the
style code is pretty much rewritten.

Any opinions on whether we can remove  "great style flag rewrite" from
the TO-DO list?

Apply this patch from the base of the fvwm source tree with the "-p 0"
option.

Oops, I'm afraid  too  many people will  not be   able to  read  split
attachments, so heres the same patch not split:

This  rather large patch   is version 1.0   of the "Icon Boxes" patch.
After applying this patch, there can be multiple Icon Boxes defined in
1 style command.  Optional Icon Grids can also be defined.

This patch does not provide for alternate Icon Box Gravities.

Since I had to  change the style parsing,  storage and retrieval,  the
style code is pretty much rewritten.

Any opinions on whether we can remove  "great style flag rewrite" from
the TO-DO list?

Apply this patch from the base of the fvwm source tree with the "-p 0"
option.

That's true. And that precisely why I want to have the icon reflect
the content of the window....

Exactly my sentiments. I browsed through the code, and, personally, I
think it shouldn't be that hard. There's a notification if the window
changes its title already.

EJ

1) You might get a more favorable response if you'd try saying "please".   :-)
2) I believe Jason answered this same complaint last month. Let's not flog a
dead horse.

Jason:
On the other hand, very large e-mails arriving unexpectedly can sometimes
be a pain in the ol' hemorrhoids, and not everyone has access to his own
Web/ftp site. Is the little-used unnoficial_patches/ directory on the FVWM ftp
site public-uploadable? It might not be a bad practice to put larger patches
there, if possible, rather than in-lining them.

 Cheers,
 Bob

I haven't taken any insult.  After dealing with  computer users for 34
years, you'd have to go pretty far to even make in impression. :-)

Just a little humor there.  I agree completely with the complaint.

I don't remember any complaint about  large patches, I do remember the
request  to  use mime  attachments.  Actually   I expected the  base64
encoding to do some kind of compression, but now I think about it, I'm
not surprised it made the patch even bigger.

It seemed to go  from 86K to 121K.   Compressed and uuencoded its 40K,
probably still a little big for e-mail.

As you guessed, I don't have access to my  own web site.  I understand
there  are places I   can get  a free   one, but   I guess  there  are
restrictions on how much data you can store there.

I agree that a common  public uploadable site  would be very desirable
and I promise to use it should it become available.

	Hi all.  I'm interested in using FvwmM4 (I think) but am having a
little trouble getting it to fly.  I can't say that I'm an M4 expert, but I
have used it in the past.  My trouble is not specific, but quite general, I
don't know how to go about doing what I want.  I use a large number of
nearly identical functions in my menus and buttons and I'd like to use
a tool like M4 to generate it for me.  Any URLs to additional FvwmM4 
documentation and/or examples would be great.  Another catch is that I use
similar, but not quite identical setups on about 4 completely
independent systems.  There's a little more info in the next paragraph should 
you wish to read more about what I want to do.

---
	For starters I have a large tiered menu system with many different
types of systems in it.  I have certain window characteristics based on
whether it's a router, server or general purpose machine.  I wish to be
able to put all of these in macros :

router(a.b, a.b.me.net)

	which could expand to a menu item:

+ "a.b" exec xterm -sb -sl 1000 -j -ls -n a.b -T a.b -bg DarkSeaGreen 
	-e telnet a.b.me.net

	Other systems would have other requirements, for instance :

system(a.b, a.b, u@a.b, a.b.me.net, 80x40)

+ "a.b" exec xterm -sb -sl 1000 -j -ls -n a.b -T u@a.b -bg Purple -geom 80x40
	-e ssh a.b.me.net

	...or whatever.

	I might even have xterm() be a macro:

xterm() = xterm -sb -sl 1000 -j -ls 

	then I only make changes in one place and common changes are easy
to rdist to the different machines I'm on.




	Thanks for any help offered.

Of course not; I have no intention of becoming a porn and pirated software
distribution site.  You can upload to /pub/incoming/fvwm as has always been
possible, but you must inform someone that things are there so they can be
moved.

Does nobody check the incoming directory?  The fvwm subdirectory exists
and is writable, and has been for a few years now.

Hello, I am about to install Linux on my PC.  I want to use the FVWM window
system on my PC.  I am not sure how to do so.  I installed RED-HAT before,
but it had an interface similar to Windows 95.  I don't want that.  Could
you please tell me if I need to install the slackware version or RedHat or
does it matter.  Once I install it what do I need to do to make sure my
Graphic interface uses the FVWM interface?


Thanks in Advance,


Rob King

There are several programs derived from fvwm, one of them is called
fvwm95.  It (fvwm95) provides a look similar to Win95.  To find out if
you're using this program, start up your windowing system, and type
the following command into an xterm:

    ps auxww | grep -i fvwm

I'm sure that you can tell from this output whether you're running
fvwm95 or not.

If you're running fvwm95, you need to find out whether the program
fvwm2 is on your machine.  To do this, type "which fvwm2" and "which
fvwm".  If they both produce a "not found" answer, you need to install
fvwm2.  If one of them produces a "found" answer, you can type "fvwm
-version" or "fvwm2 -version".  This will tell you whether you have
version 2 or not.

To start fvwm2 rather than fvwm95, you need to find where it starts up
that program and edit the appropriate file.  Usually, the programs
started can be found in ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession.  Just edit the file
to start the right program and then log out and log in again.

If I have a dialog box above a dialog box above a dialog box, for example in 
the following wish script:

wm withdraw .
toplevel .1; wm transient .1 {}
toplevel .2; wm transient .2 .1
toplevel .3; wm transient .3 .2

(here, the idea is that .1 created the dialog .2, which created a dialog .3).
fvwm2.0.46 keeps .3 above .2, and .2 above .1, but if I raise .1, then it and 
.2 appear above .3!

I'm not saying this is wrong (ICCCM2.0 doesn't seem to require anything 
particularly), but it's arguably wrong, and probably there ought to be an 
option allowing the other behaviour, where windows would be kept in the 
relative stacking order according to the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property.

Wanted to inform all of a problem I had the other day.

I have the following in my .bashrc:

PS1='bash % '
export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]2;$LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME: \
$PWD\007\033]1;$LOGNAME@$HOST\007"'

which puts the username and the working directory in the titlebar.  Works
very well on my computer.  However, the other day I connected to my 
computer from one at work, and I never got a prompt.  I gave up on the
connection, grabbed my .bashrc with ftp, put a "#" in front of the
"export..." stuff to make it a comment, and sent the new .bashrc back to
my computer.  Reconnected and everything worked just fine.  I don't know
if this will happen to everyone (I was connecting from a VMS machine), and
anybody who knows more than I do is invited to volunteer their knowledge.

G.F.

Greg

Your mention of VMS makes me suspicious. What kind of terminal were you using?
The escape sequences you used are for xterms, and could well break any
other terminal or emulator. To be safe enclose the xterm-specific bits in
some kind of test:

  case $TERM in
      xterm*)
          export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \
              "\033]2;$LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME: $PWD\007\033]1;$LOGNAME@$HOST\007"'
          ;;
  esac

if you're using linux, then just stick the following line into your
.[t]cshrc:

eval `dircolors`

or the following into your .bashrc

actually... I just reallized... I don't have it in my .bashrc ... well...
anyway... dircolors simply displays the proper environment variables to
set... so you should just set the environments that show up from it.

Here's a nice little shell script for colors :

---- showcolors -----

#!/bin/bash
       # Display ANSI colours.
       #
       esc="\033["
       echo -e "\t  40\t   41\t   42\t    43\t      44       45\t46\t 47"

         line1="$fore  "
         line2="    "
         for back in 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47; do
           line1="${line1}${esc}${back};${fore}m Normal  ${esc}0m"
           line2="${line2}${esc}${back};${fore};1m Bold    ${esc}0m"
         done
         echo -e "$line1\n$line2"
       done

-------------------

Here's the content of my .bashrc file:

It sets the ls colors, and the prompt.  The escape code \033]0;<blabla>\007 puts the user name
host name, and current working directory in the xterm title bar...

Anyone know of a way to have iconised windows only represented in the
IconBox?

Hi all,

I built the fvwm-2.0.46 on a Sun Sparc:
% uname -a 
SunOS eros 5.5.1 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

Then I set the display to a SGI:
% uname -a
IRIX ares 5.3 11091810 IP12 mips

When I run the window manager 'fvwm2', and I press on mouse #1 on
the root window, it doesn't popup the RootMenu for me, even though
I did set it in the ~/.fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1         R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop

And I realize that the mouse #2 on root window doesn't work either,
only mouse #3 on root-window can trigger my menu.

Any idea ??

Thanks,

Quoc.

A stab in the dark: have you reordered the position of the mouse
buttons?  I think you can run a program which changes this, "xset m
321" or something.  This is often done by left-handed people.

(On my OpenWindows 3.5 system, xset doesn't have this option, so it
might be a different program, but I forget which one.)

If I understand correctly you are running fvwm2 on the Sun and
displaying on the X server of the SGI. It may be that the objectserver
is running on the SGI and grabbing the button 1 and 2 mouse events.
Kill the objectserver and try again.

Just a guess ...

> The iconboxes patch is now available

Nice one!  A couple of questions though:

1) The man page I can use an X-geometry spec and gives:
   IconBox   -80x200-1-1
   as an example.  Is the first "-" a typo?  I've used =80x200-1-1 and it works.
   
2) I took me a time to work out that multiple IconGrids are necessary when using
   multiple IconBoxes.  It makes for very long lines in my setup:
   Style * IconBox =314x100+6-150, IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-250, 
IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-350, IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-450, 
IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-550, IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-650, 
IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-750, IconGrid 64 64, IconBox =314x100+6-850, 
IconGrid 64 64

3) Are you working on making the placement direction controllable?  The above
   line is only there so I can have icons going upwards.  If you are could you
   make it possible to bottom align the icons if they're going upwards?

Ta for the patch anyway,
Tim.

Its a typo.  I'll make a note to fix it in version 1.1, if a real need
for 1.1 arises.  The "=" isn't necessary, "80x200-1-1" will do.

Sorry, obviously you need the IconGravity? patch.  In 1.1, I'll try to
make it clearer.   The IconGrid only  affects the 1 preceeding IconBox
(as you found).

I too want to fill my primary  IconBox from the  bottom up, so I guess
its just a matter of time before I get around  to it.  If someone else
wants to jump  in on this,  let me  know, and  I'll do something  else
during my evenings  and weekends.  I  really would like to unravel the
focus code.

I started work on it last night.  Stay tuned.

The syntax is:

Style "*" IconFill arg1 arg2

The first arg can be:

b | bot | bottom | t | top

The second arg can be:

l | lft | left | r | rgt | right

Hi

I note that others have reported runaway Goodstuff processes under Solaris
and that Chuck suggested not using Goodstuff as a solution.  
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/w3highlighter/fvwm/9604/msg00379.html?line=62#hilite

It so happens that I have accounts on many different machines and I
*really like* being able to get to them at a single click of a button. So,
I want to run Goodstuff and so do many other users.  However, every now
and then (often when a PCX or Exceed user has their PC crash)  goodstuff
starts gobbling all the cpu it can get.

I'm using fvwm 1.24r under Digital Unix 4.0.  I have found fvwm 2.0.45
buggy with autoraise windows flashing, and sometimes complete freezes.
Therefore I'd like a 1.24r solution if possible. 

Cheers
Mike

Any ideas of how to implement the following:

A "PPP on-off button" in GoodStuff which displays
an icon (telephone).  When you click on it, it
runs a script (ppp-on, for setting up a ppp connection
to your internet provider) and displays another icon
(telephone off the hook).  If you click once more
it runs another script (ppp-off, for closing the
ppp connection) and displays the first icon again.

Is this difficult?  Any nice icons for this?

  Marcel

Does anyone know if fvwm or X11 in general allows for a mouse-less
system?  I know how to move the mouse cursor around with the keyboard,
but how do you click the mouse buttons?

Any hints appreciated

 I use a bunch of virtual desktops, for various functions.  One desktop I
 use exclusivly for programming.  On each screen I will have cpp and header
 files for a particular class for example, and a sticky xterm that I use to
 compile whenever any changes are made.  But, when I go from the
 programming desktop to another, I don't want this sticky window to jump to
 the next desktop.  
 
 So, after my ramblings, is there any way to get a sticky window to only
 stick on one desktop and non of the others?
 
 Thanks

   extends to a G-equivariant homeomorphism between dX and dY.

Remove the -Aa from the compile options.  Not exactly sure why gcc does
this on HP-UX.

Hi, all.
 Can anyone tell me how to set up more than one virtual desktops?
 Also how do you use `uname -n` in xterm command for your goodstuff?

 For example, this is what I used in preference manager which did not work:

 xterm -geometry 80x26+50+50 -T xterm@`uname -n`

 Can you actually use uname -n for xterm command within goodstuff?

What is the status of the ColorLimit patch with regards to 2.0.46? IIRC, .46
rolled in my patches to "normalize" the M_WINDOWSHADE and M_MINI_ICON packets,
but not the ColorLimit patch. Besides needing the functionality (since I have
an 8-bit display), I need to know what to do in my next release of X11::Fvwm.
It saves the ColorLimit value if it sees it, but never uses it directly. Thus,
the library is not vulnerable. But I had been including the needed patches with
the release, and I need to know if the ColorLimit patch can even be applied 
over 2.0.46.

I have been told it applies to 2.0.46, you may  need to use "patch -l"
to ignore any   whitespace  differences.   Chuck indicated  he   would
include "colorlimiting" in 2.0.47.

I successfully applied the colorlimit patch to 2.0.46.  If I remember
correctly I needed to specify --ignore-whitespace and --fuzz=3 to
get it to patch cleanly.

I've been using IconMan pretty happily for a while now, but a friend
and I are now stymied by the same thing. We're both looking to run
separate IconMen to cover desk/page windows v. the rest. This is
supposed to be possible according to the man page and I've configured
IconMan correctly, I think. However, when I invoke IconMan I get my
first manager showing what it's supposed to show and the second
instance showing nothing except an FvwmIconMan button. I'm still
trying to figure out if IconMan is showing the other IconMan window or
whether that's a title button...

Anyway, is anyone doing this successfully? Does FvwmIconMan need to be
invoked in some special way when multiple IconMen are configured (e.g.
"Module FvwmIconMan 1"). This didn't seem to work... I can provide the
salient bits from my rcfile, but not until later (home machine). It
seems the relevant information is like so:

FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 2
FvwmIconMan*1*resolution page
FvwmIconMan*2*resolution global

It gets invoked with "Module FvwmIconMan" currently.

Finally, it seems that FvwmIconMan opens all windows it's configured
for when it's invoked. This is correct? It would be nice to have each
one able to be invoked separately, since ultimately I'm trying to
Swallow the IconMen into FvwmButtons... Works great for one IconMan,
but two's been quite the headache.

One last thing, I'm running RedHat Linux 4.0 with many many RPMs
upgraded, 2.0.30 kernel compiled by me, AcceleratedX 2.1 and
fvwm-2.0.46 also compiled by yours truly. Any insight would be greatly
appreciated.

A long time ago, I installed fvwm95 on our site for my users. I've noticed
that the development of fvwm95 seems to have stopped at 2.0.43.
I've heard that it is because all the fvwm95 features are included in
newer fvwm2's.  I would like to be able to switch my users to fvwm2 without
them noticing the change.

Hence the following question...  Where can I get my hands on fvwm2rc's
that propperly emulate the 95 look and feel ?

You could verify that by setting a different title for each manager
window (see below) and see which ends up in there.

> FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 2
> FvwmIconMan*1*resolution page
> FvwmIconMan*2*resolution global

That looks like the right way to do it.  From the FvwmIconMan man
page:

       If a window could be handled by more than one manager, then
       the manager with the lowest id gets it.

That quote is towards the end of the section on show and dontshow
options so it may not be relevant outside of those options.  However,
I think that this should mean the first manager gets the icons for the
current page and the second manager everything else modulo show and
dontshow specs because the current page manager has a lower id#.  If
that's not what's happening I would consider it a bug.

No need to invoke them separately.  You just have to be a bit clever
with FvwmButtons.  I came up with the following:

*FvwmButtons(104x2, Frame 0, Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) "Emacs Icons" \
    "Module FvwmIconMan")
*FvwmButtons(104x2, Frame 0, Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) "XTerm Icons" Nop)
*FvwmButtons(104x2, Frame 0, Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) "Misc Icons" Nop)

*FvwmIconMan*1*title "Emacs Icons"
*FvwmIconMan*2*title "XTerm Icons"
*FvwmIconMan*3*title "Misc Icons"

They key is to use UseOld and Nop.  The first FvwmButtons line starts
FvwmIconMan which maps all the managers.  That first line waits for
the first manager to map and swallows it.  When the second line gets
processed, the UseOld catches the existence of the second manager but
doesn't do anything other than swallow (since function is Nop).  Same
for the third and any others that you may have.

It's probably the same probably I've submitted a patch for in 2.0.46, namely
X calls in the signal handler. Look for 'DeadPipe' in the code and try to
replace it with a simple exit(1) call. That will cure the runaway process
problem, and hopefully introduce no significant others.

Other modules may have the same problem.

OK, finally quit putting it off and went to 2.0.46. It seems that my 
FvwmButtons cannot get colors for the pixmap background like it did under *.45.
Mind you, this is the same pixmap I use for my active-state title and handles.
Right this minute, this composition window has a sane pixmap, while the buttons
box looks, well, bleached. Despite being the same pixmap. Was there a patch I
may have had (but forgotten) in 2.0.45, that I need for 46?

Hmmm, tricky tricky. To make sure that everything is in order here, you want
manager #1 to show everything on the current page and manager #2 to show
everything else? That currently won't work. FvwmIconMan assigns windows to
managers based only on the show and dontshow lists, and the resolution acts as 
a filter to control which windows a manager is managing get drawn. 

What you want to do would be cool though, and it's a logical thing to
expect. I just never expected it. I'll look into how to fix this.

Correct. It seems the other replies covered this. Yes?

I am not aware of a W95 look-alike for fvwm.  It could be done though,
but I personally don't see why anyone would bother.  There are a few
sites that specialize in layouts.  A good starting point might be:
<http://www.plig.org/xwinman/> 

Another alternative may be the ``K-Desktop Environment'' (KDE).  Some
of their stuff is very good, some of it is obviously still alpha.
As for the look and feel, they seem to be getting (all?) their
inspiration from W95.  A window manager is part of the KDE group of
programs.  <http://www.kde.org/>

Hope this helps

It seems that no-one has an answer that works out of the box.
Therefore, I contribute my part -- I like fvwm to look but not feel
like Win95.  I achieve the look with the following lines in .fvwmrc:

,-----
| TitleStyle LeftJustified ActiveUp (Solid midnightblue -- flat) \
|         ActiveDown (Solid midnightblue -- flat) \
|         Inactive (Solid lightgrey -- flat)
| BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles, NoInset   
| ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- UseTitleStyle flat
| ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap win95-maximize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
| ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap win95-minimize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
| HilightColor lightgrey grey45           
| MenuStyle black lightgrey slategrey -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-70-iso8859-1 mwm
| Style "*"		Color black/grey
`-----

As I don't really use Win95 I'm not sure if it's close enough.  But
you can surely tweak it.  You might need to snarf the win95-*.xpm
thingies from Fvwm95.

Win 95! Ugh.

fvwm2 truly is able to emulate the 95 look and feel.  Look in the
sample.fvwmrc directory at the file "decor_examples".

If you  had applied the  "colorlimiting patch" in  2.0.45, it wouldn't
have any affect on your colors unless you added a "ColorLimit" line to
your .fvwm2rc.  So if you see a line  like that in your .fvwm2rc, odds
are you applied that patch to 2.0.45.

Why you are getting a different set of colors for the same pixmap in
2 different places isn't clear.  Yet.

scwm, the Scheme Configurable Window Manager, is now up to version
0.2. It is a version of fvwm2 with the configuration language replaced
by Guile Scheme, but many new experimental features enabled by the use
of a more powerful language will be added.

The main new features in this release are:

* Autoconf configurability. No more futzing with imake, just ./configure
  and go.

* Command-line option handing including an interactive repl mode - the
  configuration file is read, then you can enter window manager commands
  at a prompt.

* An implementation of window styles. However, all style options dynamically
  update for all existing matching windows and almost all of the style
  options are also available as procedures that operate on one window at
  a time.

Get it from http://web.mit.edu/mstachow/www/scwm.html


Note on future release announcements:

I created the mailing lists scwm-announce@mit.edu and
scwm-discuss@mit.edu, the former for release announcements only and
the latter for general discussion. Send me mail if you would like to
be added to either or both of these. I will not send future
announcements to the gwm or fvwm lists, and am doing so for this
release only because people on these lists formerly expressed
interest, and I don't remember them all to put them on the announce
list. I will probably continue to send release announcements to the
gnome and guile lists if the respective maintainers think that is
appropriate.

I've looked over the man pages and archives unsuccessfully in search of a
way to do the following:

 is there a way to define a button in FvwmButtons that acts as a true button,
 in the sense that if its pressed then something is ON (and have the button
 look pressed), otherwise its OFF (and the button looks UNpressed).

Defining the actions is simple, I just can't get the button to stay pressed - 
is there a way to do that ?


Here are the relevant entries from my .fvwm2rc file

AddToMenu MiniScrollMenu
+       "ON"                    EdgeResistance 500 100
+       "OFF"                   EdgeResistance 10000 10000

*FvwmButtons Paging     clamp.xpm       Popup MiniScrollMenu


Is there any way to get a pressed look when I select OFF ?

BTW: I'm using fvwm-2.0.45

Thanks in advance

Okay, a couple of issues.  I just upgraded from 2.0.45 to 2.0.46, and I
was surprised (1) to find you have to add ".2" to the module names when
you try for the man pages (that's intuitive), and (2) that FvwmConfig is
not there by default.  Not a huge deal, but it is kind of useful if you
want to play around a little.  Was it removed at the author's request, or
did somebody decide it went against the wonderful dinosaur tradition of
having to configure everything by hand with an editor?

So now my question.  I would like to have my FvwmButtons centered on the
screen.  I can do it by brute force:  get the geometry from FvwmIdent,
then put it in *FvwmButtonsGeometry...  But wouldn't it be nice if I could
just say "center FvwmButtons along the bottom edge of the screen" and
forget about it?

Hmm?  not on my system....

In ``Fvwm.tmpl'' (used by xmkmf) there are these lines:
    /* Where do you want the fvwm man pages installed. */
    #define FvwmManPath /usr/X11R6/man
    #define FvwmManSuffix 1
which give you control over where you want the man pages.

Don't know, but if you want it, it's in ``fvwm-2.0.46/extras/FvwmConfig''.
    cd extras/FvwmConfig
    make
    su
    make install

The centering can be achieved with m4 pre-processing (m4_eval), but I
think you still need to know the width of the button bar.

	Hi all, I decided to give FvwmWharf a swing since I really
like fvwm but could use Wharf/Doc functionality in a big way.  (I use
FvwmButtons now, but a wharf would be much better for me efficiency-wise).
I've noticed a couple of things.  First of all it seems to like to print only
the first icon in a folder and just black for the rest.  Sometimes it will show
the other icons properly if you select one of the other ones (black void)
first.

	Another disadvantage I noticed is that although it's able to do nifty
gradient fills in the transparent portions of XPMs, it's unable to throw
a bit of text at the bottom like FvwmButtons.  This is really important to
me since a lot of the stuff in the bar is ssh's to different machines as
different users (myself, uucp, news etc...) it doesn't warrant drawing 
new icons for every single session.  Are there any plans whatsoever to 
continue/restart FvwmWharf development?  Are there any patches out there?
Is the black-void problem a known bug?

	Thanks,

Installed the RPM from Red Hat contrib, so none of that was involved here.
I guess this is an issue with the package builder, who is as far as I can
tell unidentified.

Again, I know it is included optionally, but once again, it is not
included with the RPM.

I don't see how M4 can do any better for you than just hard-coding
*FvwmButtonsGeometry in there.  Sure, you can make some kind of
BUTTONBARWIDTH macro, but that really makes it no easier.  Anyway, thanks
for your comments.

SCREEN_WIDTH: predefined m4 macro
FVWM_BUTTONS_WIDTH: define this macro yourself
FVWM_BUTTONS_X := SCREEN_WIDTH/2 - FVWM_BUTTON_WIDTH/2
  let m4 compute this for you

Okay, that's fine.  But would it be possible to write a method that
interferes at some point between FvwmButtons being assembled and
FvwmButtons being placed on the screen, at which time the window and
border width, as well as the screeen width, are figured out and the above
calculation happens, then FvwmButtons is given an appropriate geometry
spec?  Doing it by hand, even if you use m4 to avoid a little arithmetic,
is a little unsatisfying.

I have a problem with the IconGrid and IconFill styles, I use 

Style * IconBox 55 6 314 874, IconGrid 1 96, IconFill Bottom Left

yet the first icons are placed at the left hand edge of the screen (they should
be 55 from the left edge) with a left-edge more than 55 they start to get placed
some distance from the left-edge but are off by about 50-60 pixels.  I've looked
at the patch and I can't spot an error but it looks like it's placing the right
hand edge of the icons in the grid.  If I change to IconFill Bottom Right it all
works fine.

Good work anyway,
Timbo.

P.S. I won't ask for it but sooner or later someone will: how about

IconFill Left Bottom
to place icons in columns?

P.P.S. Have you really done TGSFR in this patch?

Sounds like there will be a version 1.2.

Of  course you can   get columns by  using   multiple narrow  but tall
iconboxes.   I've gone this far, I   guess I should  deal with columns
more directly.

> P.P.S. Have you really done TGSFR in this patch?

Well, I rewrote all the style code, and its now a tiny fraction of its
original size.  Plus, I think  adding a style bit flag  can be done in
under 10 lines of code.  (I didn't count anything,  I'm just trying to
say it should be simple.)

Well, if you have two systems with different size screens, or you use
different screen resolutions for different users, m4 pre-processing is
a real help.  As long as the size of the object is fixed, you can then
calculate the necessary offsets for centering based on the ``HEIGHT''
and ``WIDTH'' values of the screen.

This may not be applicable for you.

Actually, the packager is not unidentified:

    Fvwm is a small, fast, and very flexible window manager.  It can be

The reason the man pages for the modules have the `.2' suffix is so
that they don't stomp on the manual pages for the same modules from
fvwm-1.24r (or fvwm95), which ships with Red Hat Linux.  This shouldn't
really be a surprise---the `original' fvwm2 RPM package shipped on the
Red Hat PowerTools CD is the same way.  It's also a good idea to list
the files in a binary RPM before you install it, especially if you're
not the one who built it; the same caveats apply to contrib RPMs as to
binary tarballs from Joe's FTP site.

To be honest, the reason most of the stuff from .../extras/ isn't
included in the RPM is that i don't use most of it.  You'll note that
some of it is, and you might note that more of it used to be, but
didn't really work so well and got removed (if you have a recent
version of rpm, you can do `rpm -q --changelog fvwm2' to view the
changelog).  If you'd rather have FvwmConfig, feel free to build your
own RPM---it's not that difficult, and you can use
fvwm2-2.0.46-3.src.rpm as a starting point.

Jim,

Naturally, this is exactly where I looked; I just didn't realize that the
packager is not listed with the binary RPM.

I figured that was the reason, but the man pages for the 2.0.45 modules,
which were separately packaged in fvwm2-modules-2.0.45, did NOT require
the ".2".  I have used them a million times.  In any case, no biggie.  To
get these things to change I can certainly build my own fvwm2, but the
differences were noticeable to me, the average schmo installing binary
RPMS, so I thought it was a good idea to mention them.  I didn't mean to
imply that I blindly upgraded to 2.0.46 then freaked out upon discovering
that a couple of things changed.  Cheers,

G.F.

I can't get Netscape to work with ActivePlacement "property". I
declared following in my ~/.fvwm2rc:

Style   "*"             ActivePlacement
Style   "Netscape*"     ActivePlacement

and so forth, no matter what I've entered into rc-file Netscape always
places itself into top-left corner of screen - is there any way to get
Netscape listen fvwm2?

I'm using fvwm 2.0.45-BETA-4 with Debain/GNU Linux 1.3.0.

I used to work with a GIS software under HP-VUE, recently I installed
fvwm and got a little problem:
The GIS has a main window and up to nine child windows that (under motif
or HPvue) never could go under the main window (usefull for a toolbar
for example). with fvwm their behavior is almost the same except when I
click in the main window which comes on the top and hide all of its
children.
I've tried the fvwm options: MWMFunctions, MWMHints, StaysOnTop ...
but none gave me the right behavior.

Another question is about Drag and Drop. Is there any mean to use drag
and drop with vuefile and any of the fvwm Modules such as FvwmButtons or
FvwmScript.

Thanks in advance.

You need to add NoPPosition to the netscape style line.  I have in my
fvwm2rc for netscape:

Style "Netscape" ClickToFocus, NoPPosition

and netscape no longer insists on popping up in the upper left.

Hello,

I'm using fvwm manager quite a long time (since 1.0.20 times) and I
still cannot get rid of a nasty problem: Sometimes, during havy word the
manager looses focus, it isn't possible to get active window with mouse
click. It's possible to get it through the win-list, but after clicking
another window it gets lost again. Neither restarting fvwm helps. The
only way to get things OK for a while is to quit fvwm and start again.
This problem appeared already in 1.0.x versions. I use version 2.0.46,
Xfree 3.3 and linux 2.0.30 now.

Best regards

S.Kvasnica

   Actually not even  xterms  listen to my .fvwm2rc configs!  I just
   assumed (till now) that if there are many windows open on a certain
   desktop/workspace you get the "rubber.band" thingie with the
   ActivePlacement otherwise if there are no windows open *any* window
   (even an xterm) will pop.open on the top.left corner of my screen.

   Am I wrong in my assumptions?

   Hmm.. I just looked and I see the following in my ~/.fvwm2rc file:

[paste from .fvwm2rc begin]
Style "*"           DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"           SloppyFocus, ActivePlacement
[paste from .fvwm2rc end]

   So I do have "NoPPosition" defined for all windows and I do not
   override this for Xterm nor Netscape!

   This is not a problem for me though since i do not really mind
   this behavior.

   Just my comments, hope this is helpful,

I experience the same problem under 2.0.45 under Solaris about once a week..
(just another data point).

This sounds like you have SmartPlacement turned on.  SmartPlacement
will look for an empty area on your screen where to put a window.  If
it doesn't find one, it gives up and ActivePlacement or
RandomPlacement takes effect.

With recent versions of fvwm, you can say "GlobalOpts
SmartPlacementIsReallySmart" and SmartPlacement will not give up so
easily.  Instead, it will use an area on a "best fit" basis.

In general, SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement and
ActivePlacement/RandomPlacement are orthogonal to each other.  And the
GlobalOpt mentioned above means that {Active,Random}Placement is never
used.

Or is this all rubbish and I haven't slept enough the past nights?

   Yea that is what one would expect, but the only place I have
   "SmartPlacement" defined is at:

      Style "Fvwm*"       RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement

   which I do not believe would affect xterms nor netscape.  Or have
   I mistaken??

Hi:

I'm a beginner of LInux. I use redhat 4.1, 2.0.27. fvwm is 2.0.41.

Now I download the fvwm 2.0.46,  then I use the following commands to
compile:

1. ./MakeMakefiles
2.  make
3.   make install
4.  make install.man

Are they correct?

Now I re-start x-windows, but I don't know whether I am running fvwm .41
or .46 version. Any idea?

THe most important is: do I have to replace, or edit some files to make
my upgradation work? You know, I'm comfused by so many config files, and
nobody tell me the details.

ANother question: I found some fvwm config files in internet make the
screen look great, so I also want to download it and replace my old one.
But I really don't know which old file should be replaced, and what's
the path of the old file! Just few weeks for LInux world!!

PLease help me!! Thank you very very much!!

PLease e-mail me! More details appreciate!!

Hi Jack,

Sometime in the late 1900s you wrote:

   Well first off Welcome to Linux.  I must mention that I am not a
   RedHat user so I have no clue as to how RedHat's RPM works with
   upgrades.  Maybe someone else using RedHat or more familiar with
   it could explain more for you.

   If you got no errors doing these .. yes they should've worked.

jz> Now I re-start x-windows, but I don't know whether I am running fvwm .41

   This depends on your ".xinitrc" file.  You either have this file in
   your home directory or you are using your system default one which
   is located in:  "/usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc"  which usually is a symlink
   to another file in the same directory (this path *may* differ in your
   RedHat distribution.  I do not know for sure.  See if you see such
   a directory).

   If you are using the system default one you should make the symlink
   point to the appropriate "xinitrc.window_manager" file, where in your
   case "window_manager" is 'fvwm2' and so the file would be named
   "xinitrc.fvwm2".

   But if you have a ".xinitrc" file in your home directory you'll need
   to modify that file to start 'fvwm2' instead of 'fvwm'.  *IF* you
   do not have this file in your home directory it is recommended to
   copy the system xinitrc file to your home directory, renaming it to
   ".xinitrc" and modify that file instead of messing with the system
   default one.  That way you minimize any possible 'risk' of damage.

   Most important note:  If you are not too sure of what you are doing
   ALWAYS keep backups of the config files you are about to modify.
   This way if something goes wrong you can always go back to the old
   set up.

   Another thing to remember is never modify too many things at once
   and then test.  You should modify/test incrementally.  That way
   figuring out what went wrong becomes much easier.

jz> ANother question: I found some fvwm config files in internet make the
jz> screen look great, so I also want to download it and replace my old one.

   Just as I mentioned above.. first get fvwm2 going and when that is
   all working fine then go about using the config files you wish to
   use.

jz> But I really don't know which old file should be replaced, and what's
jz> the path of the old file! Just few weeks for LInux world!!

   For starting up window mannager's the important files are either of
   the following:

      ~/.xinitrc
      /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc

   For you fvwm2 setup the two files you should look at are either of
   the following:

      ~/.fvwm2rc
      /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwmrc

   If the first one of the two files is found the second one is not
   looked at.  So the first file (the one in your home directory)
   has precedence over the other.  [Note: the last directory would
   depend on where you installed fvwm2.]

   Again note that the paths *may* differ in a RedHat distribution.
   Since I am not familiar with RedHat I do not know.

   Having said all this I'd like to wish you luck.  The above
   information provided by me is only meant to help you.  I do
   not assume any responsibility for the results of the changes
   mentioned above.

[I'm new to this list, just subscribed before I sent this, so if this bug is
 known/under discussion, I'm sorry]

fvwm2.0.46 is dumping core on me, running Linux 2.0.31pre10, X11R6.1
(XFree86 3.1).

Active defines in Fvwm.tmpl are

OPTION_DEFINES = -DSHAPE -DVECTOR_BUTTONS -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS -DINACTIVE_BTNS -DMINI_ICONS -DEXTENDED_TITLESTYLE -DWINDOWSHADE

and I have libXpm. fvwm was compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3, both with `-O2 -m486
-mwide-multiply -fomit-frame-pointer -freg-struct-return' and with `-g -m486
-mwide-multiply -freg-struct-return'. The core dump occurs in both cases.

I find it easy to reproduce, but I've only got one system to test it on :(;
including a pixmap in a menu[1], with either % or *, causes a core dump.
Tracing indicates that the system dumps core when loading the pixmap on return
from LoadPicture() to CachePicture() in libs/Display.c. There is no obvious
sign of overwrite errors anywhere in LoadPicture(), other than the fact that
it dumps core on the return (so, presumably, the stack frames have been
mangled. I haven't gdb'ed it yet so can't be sure.)

I've replicated this with both jwindow.xpm and the basic, bare mini.xpm in the
sample pixmaps that come with the fvwm2 distribution.


Either I'm being terribly terribly stupid here, or there is a bug here
somewhere. If anyone wants more info, just ask (I should be subscribed to this
list as this message appears; it may take longer if subscription requires
authentication); the core dump is available if anyone really wants it, but
it's 350K long and I'm on a dialup host :(

Thanks to all those who helped me to solve this problem last time it
occurred, but unfortunately with my recent upgrade from 2.0.45 to .46
it's reared it's ugly head again.

My problem is that the following line in my .fvwm2rc doesn't always
cause a xdaliclock to run and be swallowed when starting or restarting
Fvwm

*FvwmButtons(3x1, Swallow (NoClose,UseOld) xdaliclock 'Exec xdaliclock
-12 -nocycle -noseconds -bg lightgrey -fg "#660066" -geometry
280x80+0+0')

and I can't work out why. I've tried all the things that were suggested
when my perfmeter didn't work (Which incidentally starts up _every_
time!) and none of them seem to make any difference.

Any ideas gratefully accepted.

 I'm pretty sure that the default is SmartPlacement (I don't have the code
with me at work, so I can't double check this right now). Kai is basically
right, though.

 Try specifying

  Style  "Netscape"  DumbPlacement, ActivePlacement

and things should work as you want.

 Bob

Hi folks

I've produced revision 'e' of my Pager balloon patch. The main change
is that it is now possible to have balloons in the iconified pager too.

Get it from:

Hi all,

   I was just searching the fvwm.archive for issues regarding attachments
   sent to the list.  But either I didn't do a good job of searching
   for the answer or there wasn't a clear one.

   I work with AIX boxes at work and I always wanted an 'monitor' icon
   representing IBM's RS/6K AIX boxes for an rsh buttons on my FvwmButtons.
   I could not find one in the icon collection set.  So I finally went
   ahead and build one myself.  It is just the basic monitor with IBM
   written on top of it (I actually have 2 of these one is IBM in a darker
   blue).  I was thinking maybe others might like to get these xpm files
   for their use (granted not many use AIX nor respect it :-).

   My question is:  is it acceptable for me to uuencode them and send
   them over the list?  They are not too terribly huge:

            3930 ibm1.uue
            3993 ibm2.uue

   Also if anyone else has a better 'monitor' icon for IBM's AIX boxes
   please let me know where I could get it from.

   TIA,

Patrick ...

Subject: FVWM: transient popups beneath my StaysOnTop
Date: Mon, 20 Oct 1997 23:01:43 -0700
From: Michael M Han <han@windy.ckm.ucsf.edu>
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I've noticed something a bit odd about Fvwm2. A small number of my
windows are Style'd StaysOnTop. An even smaller number of those popup
the occassional transient window, like a menu. In particular, my
FvwmButtons Swallow's a procmeter and an FvwmPager with the Balloons
patch. The first time one of these windows is popped up (i.e., the
first time Balloons pops up a balloon hint while I mouse about my
Pager or if I click my procmeter menu to select different things to
monitor) before the focus changes, the popup appears beneath my
StaysOnTop FvwmButtons.

This is very strange to me. Back when I was using Style "*" MouseFocus
and FvwmAuto I thought it was a strange side effect of that, but I
recently switched to Style "*" ClickToFocus with no FvwmAuto and I'm
still seeing this happen. I also thought that perhaps twiddling
"GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntRaise" and "GlobalOpts
ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick" would fix things, but that's also failed.
At this point I'm at a bit of a loss to explain what's happening. It
just dawned on me to watch xev while I duplicated my problem. Here's
what I see in xev:

Mouse passes into FvwmPager over a window:
> VisibilityNotify event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x5000001,
>     state VisibilityPartiallyObscured
Balloon pops up but beneath the FvwmButtons.

Mouse leaves window w/o leaving FvwmPager:
> VisibilityNotify event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x5000001,
>     state VisibilityUnobscured
> 
> Expose event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x5000001,
>     (0,109), width 136, height 16, count 0
Balloon disappears.

Mouse reenters window in FvwmPager:
> VisibilityNotify event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x5000001,
>     state VisibilityPartiallyObscured
Balloon pops back up, now correctly above the FvwmButtons.

Unfortunately I can't see anything happening when I click the
procmeter menu. So this has me fairly confused, though not terribly
bothered. It's more a matter of idle curiosity than anything else.

This is happening on my machine with RedHat 4.1 installed, with a
2.0.30 kernel, Accelerated-X 2.1 and fvwm-2.0.46 which I compiled.
Windows are not only StaysOnTop, but Sticky also, though some checking
indicates that the problem is StaysOnTop rather than Sticky. I just
noticed the same behavior for the xterm popup VT menus when Style
"XTerm" StaysOnTop is set. Relevant portions of my rc file are at the
end.

Anyway, if anyone has any insight into what I'm seeing here, please
let me know. Thanks so much.

  I caught this line in an .fvwm2rc.m4 and was wondering if anyone had a
sample script that showed off how to create the dynamic menus.  I was
specifically wondering how to get xterms popping up and cd'ing to different
directories automatically.

Thanks, Nils.

I'm running fvwm on Digital Unix 4.0 and XDec.  Sometimes, when I log
out or restart the window manager my FvwmButtons module doesn't get
killed.  Then the modules runs away with the processor, using 50-90% of
the processor.  This is VERY bad, because the computers on our network
are used assigned jobs from a batch queue to run.  If the load is always
high because of buttons, no jobs get run.

[This is a courtesy cc of a message posted to comp.lang.perl.announce]

Tue Oct 21 15:29:15 MDT 1997

Version 1.0 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days.

This is the first regular release. The basic functionality of the API and
the constants is now pretty well frozen. Only changes to Fvwm2 should have
any future impact. More may be added, but what is currently implemented will
be supported.

The biggest changes from previous releases are that it now requires that you
have Perl 5.003 or later, and that your version of Fvwm is 2.0.46 or later.
It also now checks your version of Fvwm from the source base, to verify this.

>From the README file for 1.0:

X11::Fvwm version 1.0 (altus)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with either the Tk extension or the Xforms library as
your GUI choices!

This requires fvwm 2.0.46 or better, and Perl 5.003 or better. It is
very highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk
or X11::Xforms, also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

* Added a new sample Tk script, PerlTkDesker

* A little more documentation clean-up.

* Dropped the shipping of two patches that are now part of Fvwm 2.0.46

* Makefile.PL now allows for specification of FVWM_DIR (for source) and
  FVWM_MOD_DIR (for installation of samples). It also checks for a file

  VERSION is at least the required level.

I am just returning to the X environment (three cheers for Linux).  I
would like to setup .fvwmrc with several tools and windows open.  I recall
that there was a program (perhaps called "toolplaces") for some other
window manager (perhaps twm) that would return a list of all the windows
and tools running along with the current -geometries.  I assume that
this kind of program exists for fvwm but I can't find it.

Thanks for your help.

I believe you are getting interference from "desktopManager", part of the
Indigo Magic Desktop suite on IRIX systems.  desktopManager is the program
responsible for placing and *partially handling* the desktop icons on the
background (cdrom, camera, files, etc.)- it will place the icons and allow you
to activate (left click) or rubber-band select (middle button), however all of
the useful context operations (right click) are handled by 4Dwm, the SGI
window manager.  This makes it somewhat annoying to use stand-alone.

Killing the process should be safe, and will temporarily end your woes.  For a
more permanent solution try touch(1)ing $HOME/.desktop-hostname/nodesktop
which will prevent the desktopManager from launching at login time.

Hi!

I have set up my desktop with two StaysOnTop windows: FvwmButtons and 
FwvmIconMan.  I use SmartPlacementIsReallySmart.  New windows should 
avoid overlapping with StaysOnTop windows and icons, that works very 
well except for FwvmIconMan, that apparently is completely invisibel to 
the SmartPlacement routine.  Not only is it not avoided as a StaysOnTop 
window, overlap with FvwmIconMan is not at all taken into account when 
placing new windows.  Can anybody tell me if I can change this?  I have 
appended the relevant (I hope) lines in my .fvwm2rc below.

Versions:  fvwm 2.0.45, FvwmIconMan 0.9.8

Thank you!

Jakob

  OK, I've been playing with dynamic directory menus, and here's wha tI
currently have:

AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu"  Title
+       "Xterm 80x24"   Exec exec xterm -si -sk -geom 80x24&
+       "Xterm 80x40"   Exec exec xterm -si -sk -geom 80x40&
+       "Xterm 80x60"   Exec exec xterm -si -sk -geom 80x60&
+                       ""              Nop
+       "Xterm 80x24 Dir" DynamicDir24
+       "Xterm 80x40 Dir" DynamicDir40
+       "Xterm 80x60 Dir" DynamicDir60

AddToFunc DynamicDir24
+       "I" DestroyMenu "_root_u_lohner"
+       "I" PipeRead "/u/lohner/projects/treemenu/dynamic.pl /u/lohner 80x24"
+       "I" Popup _root_u_lohner

 and dynamic.pl is a perl5 script that takes the directory to scan, scans
it, and returns a menu for FVWM to parse, like this:

DestroyMenu     "_root_u"
AddToMenu       _root_u "/u"    Title
+       "XTerm ./"      Exec /bin/sh -c 'cd /u;exec xterm -si -sk -geom 80x24&'
+       "../"   _root_Func
+       "lohner/"       _root_u_lohnerFunc
 
AddToFunc _root_Func"
+ "I" PipeRead "/u/lohner/projects/treemenu/dynamic.pl / 80x24"
+ "I" Popup _root_
+ "C" DestroyMenu "_root_"
+ "I" DestroyFunc "_root_Func"
 
AddToFunc _root_u_lohnerFunc
+ "I" PipeRead "/u/lohner/projects/treemenu/dynamic.pl /u/lohner 80x24"
+ "I" Popup _root_u_lohner
+ "C" DestroyMenu "_root_u_lohner"
+ "I" DestroyFunc "_root_u_lohnerFunc"


The problem is this:  sometimes it works fine, sometimes it doesn't,
sometimes it refuses to remove the popups, sometimes it kills my window
system and returns to my login prompt with a core dump.  Can anyone suggest
how the AddToFuncs should look to work best?  Is it legal to have a Func
destroy itself?  Should all items be "I"?  The last two "C"?  Menu instead
of Popup?  I've tried a number of these with varying results, but so far
nothing has worked consistently so I'm wondering what the 'correct' way of
doing this is.
  Or, if anyone has a dynamic directory menu working, I wouldn't mind a
copy of that.  If anyone wants my perl code, I can post it once its
working.
  Thanks for the help in advance.

Nils.

It happened to me while I was testing the new fvwm in Xnest (in a setup
similar to yours). And yes, stack frames were mangled, there was a noticeable
delay while the program filled all stack space! After some .fvwmrc scavenging,
it stopped dumping core, but the loaded pixmaps looked very strange... To cut
a (very) long story short, everything went OK when I ran fvwm *in the main X
server*.

Conclusion: seems libxpm is to blame here. Try all visuals in your server in
turn. Probably some color depths will give trouble.

Self-destroying functions are buggy in fvwm2, since ComplexFunction in
complex.h reuses the pointer after it has been destroyed with
DeleteFunction (!).  This is a bug, and I agree, it would be nice if
they worked.  I'm only guessing that's the problem your having, but
since I saw that your function did that, I thought I'd bring it up
again.

This was discussed a while back (one of the examples included uses
technique), but no one had time to look into it further.  A hack to
get around it should probably get into 2.0.47 and shouldn't be too
hard.  If I get some time I'll look into it, but at the moment my
hands are tied.

I don't know of a program that will report geometries.

However, if you only need this information at login time there may be
a different way of achieving the same affect.  On my system, I have
``~/.xsession'' configured that it only starts fvwm2, no xterms etc.
All applications are then started by fvwm2 via the ``InitFunction''.
To set geometries and other parameters depending on screen size and
logname, I use m4 pre-processing.  If that would solve your problem I
can mail you my ``.fvwm2rc''.

xwininfo?  Works for me, though it takes one window at a time.

OpenWindows has a program "owplaces".  Maybe that is part of XView
and can be had when you install the XView packages?

I don't really have any comments (except maybe get the latest FvwmIconMan
which is 1.0 :-)) since I really doubt this is a FvwmIconMan problem. I'm
mainly reposting this with a subject more likely to attract people who know.

My only guess is that your line:
Style "Fvwm*"		NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip

is somehow confusing things due to the windowlistskip. My suggestion for a
thing to do is first remove all Style lines, except for the SmartPlacement,
and see if it's still happening.

The FvwmSaveDesk module purports to do this.  I haven't tried it
myself so no promises.

I seem to recall an xtoolplaces application from long ago that did the
same thing as the suntools app, but I can't find it at ftp.x.org.  It
might be worth an archie search.  It's possible it was simply never
ported to later versions of X11.

Version 1.2 of the "Iconboxes patch" is available at:

ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/unofficial_patches

This patch  implements multiple icon  boxes per style, icon  grids and
full icon fill direction control.

Changes in version 1.2:

1) When filling right to left, icons used to go outside left boundary.

2) Now icons can now be filled in any  direction, creating either rows
or columns.

Christ. It didn't do that to me; as I'm not ulimited I think there would
have been a *noticeable* delay while ~100Mb of swap filled up... :)

In the end I narrowed it down; using *anything* which loads pixmaps *at all*
while pixmap support is defined causes the problem. I agree, libXpm is to
blame.

I went for the `when all else fails, recompile everything' approach and moved
to XFree86 3.3.1 (X11R6.3) and libXpm 4.10 (from 4.7) and all now works,
pixmaps appear &c. And it looks utterly, utterly cool. XFree86 3.3.1 is
faster than 3.1 as well, so there are other advantages...

fvwm2 is a remarkable wm, keep up the good work, I'll be using it for a long,
long time!

hi,

i have 2 configs for my FvwmButtons-Bar. 
one normal and one that i use to go OnLine..

i use: =>

AddToFunc fvwm2b_inet
+       "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+       "I" Module FvwmButtons File /root/.fvwm2b_inet

AddToFunc fvwm2b_nrm
+       "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+       "I" Module FvwmButtons File /root/.fvwm2b_nrm

the default config is:
*FvwmButtonsFile /root/.fvwm2b_nrm

this works great, but when i change the bar (call func) by clicking a
Button in the ButtonBar i get allways this errors:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window
parameter)
Major opcode of failed request:  62 (X_CopyArea)
or:
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
Major opcode of failed request:  4 (X_DestroyWindow)

and sometimes when i change the bar the corsor becomes round and i must
first klick anywere to see the new-bar :(

what's wrong here ?

Hi,

I just upgraded to fvwm-2.0.43. 
My sound, that I configured in .fvwm2rc does not work at all, and I've no
idea why not. (Other programs like tkdesk do produce sound, so nothing wrong
with my system!) The elevant part of my .fvwm2rc looks like this:

I fixed some cosmetic bugs in the former version of animated windowshade,
and a bug where you could get an endless loop..

It still doesn't leave the bottom border, I couldnt quite get that part to
work perfectly, so I'll have to get back on that one..

It sounds to me as though you have some problems with the
configuration file .fvwmrc, but I can't really tell without seeing it.
I do know that FvwmButtons is very choosy about how it lays out
buttons so you have to be very careful when deciding on a
configuration. Sometimes it helps to specify a geometry for the Button
bar window and watch how FVWM tries to set up the buttons.

Great patch, looks pretty complete for me except for the icongrid x y which 
looks as if the x and y are swapped around ( I use IconFill Left Bottom ).  
Maybe it's just a man page blip.

Cheers,
Tim.

I had problems with the sound in one of the earlier versions of fvwm2
(like 2.0.42 I think). Just like you, it never worked at all. However,
when I upgraded to 2.0.45, it suddenly starting working okay. Thus. I
recommend you to upgrade to either 2.0.45 or 2.0.46. Hopefully, that

Is it possible to make all windows to show their contents when you move
them?(not showing the "bars") Ezppp uses this, do i have to modify all
the progs source to make this happen? Or is the modification of fvwm
config/source all that is required?

Check out OpaqueMoveSize in the man page for fvwm2.  It defaults to
showing the window contents (moving opaquely) if the window is 5% of
the screen size.  Larger windows display a rubber band.


Note to maintainers.  The man page incorrectly refers to OpaqueMove
rather than OpaqueMoveSize in the paragraph describing OpaqueMoveSize.

I tried removing all Style options except
Style "*" SmartPlacement
Style "FvwmIconMan" NoTitle, Sticky, HandleWidth 0, StaysOnTop

It didn't help.  I thought it might have been a known problem, I guess 
I'll have to make a minimal test example (after updating everything to 
the latest versions).

Put this near the start of your ``~/.fvwm2rc'' file and change the
number to 100 if you have a fast graphics card and CPU.

## This style of window movement draws the entire window as it
## moves, instead of the "rubber-band" outlines.
## It has a number (N) attached to it (default 5).  If the window occupies 
## less than N% of the screen, OpaqueMove is used. 0 <= N <= 100 
OpaqueMoveSize 25

You mean, I can find higher versions than 2.0.43 on
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm? I don't remember from where I got my version, but
I'm pretty sure, I picked the latest there was. 
I'll take a look at it tonight. Thanks a lot for the hint! Have a nice day!

Hi.

I have attempted to install fvwm-2.0.46 on a pc running RedHat linux
4.2, and using 'TheNextLevel'. However, my .FVWM2-errors file contains
multiple errors like:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module '^?ELF^A^A^A' in
ModulePath '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
'hT^D^H~C^H^E^D^H^A' in ModulePath '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module '^H~I~Eu^O~E@^A'
in ModulePath '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'

fvwm2 does not start-up correctly.

I have no idea what could be causing this and have not been able to find
a similar bug report on the
net. Do you have any suggestions ?

Aaron

Hi there.

When I try to run xemacs from fvwm2, I get a load of inunderstandable error garbage.
What do I need to do in order to get xemacs running under fvwm2 ?

You need to share with us some of the garbage.

XEmacs and fvwm2 run fine together.

If you get a minimal fvwm2rc, send it to me. I'll take a look at it.

What exactly is happening?  Is xemacs working under a different window
manager or only on a text-mode console?

Nothing -- normally.

Or should the question be ``What do I need to do in order to get
xemacs running under X?''

I use Fvwm and Netscape Mail 3.0 to see my mails. When I
used the default icons of Netscape, I had a yellow drawing
on my netscape icon when I receive a new mail.
I have change this default icon of Netscape (which is awfull) in my
.fvwmrc file by now I don't have any alarm when I reveive a new mail.
What can I do to have an alarm when I receive a mail?

Thanks

You could of course use a utility program...it's often called
"mailbox" or something alike.
If you feel like, have it swallowed by some button...:)

It's also possible to have a sound played when you receive new mail, but I 
don't know by heart how to do that...

Hi,

how do I get the Popup-Menus I used in Fvwm 1 in GoodStuff now in
FvwmButtons? 
That could it be that the entry *FvwmButtonsFile path/file does not work
- the original file has been stripped off from "*FvwmButtons".
Is there a way to get animated Icons in FvwmButtons?

Thanks

Hi,

Try

fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 -debug /etc/X11/TheNextLevel/fvwmrc.m4'

you get few errors on icon but fvwm2 comes up correctly with the similar menu
that fvwm95. The bug come from the file /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients that attempt to
start fvwm2 and fvwm95 in same manner with "fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4..." command. Note
the -f instead of -cmd.

Hope you this help.

Olivier

	I am currently using fvwm 1.24r on both a tower and a  laptop
PC both running FreeBSD. I have two questions. First of all, when
I crank it up on my tower system (P166) it seems to hang for a while and
then finish. When I run it on the laptop (P120) it seems to take forever
to come up. Is there something in my .fvwmrc file that can cause this
or is it normally real slow coming up? The other question I have is
regarding the migration path from 1.24 to 2.x. Is there a utility I can
use to convert my 1.24 .fvwmrc to the 2.x format??
	Please email you responses directly to me as I am not on the
mailing list.

Thanks
Keith

   Have you tried using xbiff?  Animated icon (although ugly) and
   an annoying beeping when you get mail  =)

I figured out already :)

> I would like to do this, if anyone knows how let me know.

If you use the program called "mailbox", just add a parameter
-B "command..." (the command string needs to be quoted !).
Then, take a sound player for your command. So, you'd get something like:
mailbox -B "/usr/sbin/sfplay /home/`whoami`/mail.wav"

Note that mailbox is quite sensitive about the order in which parameters are given.
For more info, refer to the man pages.

Hi there.

Just wondering:

is it possible to write functions (connected to a button, of course :) that can open a shell
and then run a program _in this particular shell_ ?

Thanks in advance.

xbuffy is much nicer than xbiff 
 - multiple mailboxes, 
 - can play sound when you get mail, 
 - flashes the `from' and `subject' lines when you get newmail
   or when you click on a mailbox, 
 - displays a message counter for each watched mailbox

ftp://tigger.itc.virginia.edu/pub/src/xbuffy3.3.tar.gz

I've use the command:

xbuffy -acmd "/usr/X11R6/bin/auplay  /usr/lib/tkdesk/sounds/newmail.au" \
 -poll 10 -header 10 \
 -command "gnudoit -q '(progn (raise-frame)(mh-rmail)(deactivate-mark))'" \
 /var/spool/mail/rhogee

Now I use a more complicate ~/.xbuffy file to handle multiple mailboxes.

At the moment, I'm simply using 
mailbox -m "a load of garbage" -B "/usr/sbin/sfplay /home/avwerven/public_html/ferrari.au"

but I will certainly check out about xbuffy...I vaguely remember having seen
it somewhere on the system, perhaps in /usr/local/bin.

I'm using 2.0.46 under linux 2.0.31 with XR6.3.  Things work as
expected, but I've come across the following problem:  I sometimes use
the IRC client BitchX (sorry but I'm not responsible for the name). It
comes with an icon that takes up most of my default colormap.  This is
no problem for applications that use their own ones, but is a problem
for those that don't.  So far this is as expected and isn't an fvwm
issue.   The problem is that even after BitchX finishes, the WM default
color map is still messed up.  The only thing I can do is to restart
fvwm (from within X though).  Is there some way to refresh/reinitialize
the colormap?

Thanks in advance

This is the one thing that has universally annoyed the heck out of me
on every windowing system I've ever used.  X, Windows, Mac, OS/2.  I
sometimes wonder if one of the requirements for admission to the
Brotherhood of Windowing System Designers is a pledge to do this
as part of some dispute with the Ancient Order of People Who Can
Type Without Looking at Their Screen.  Under no circumstances
whatsoever should a windowing system allow the keyboard focus to
move other than as the result of explict user action.  If, for some
reason, something absolutely needs to grab the users attention and
ask for keyboard input, it should, after stealing the keyboard, ignore
input until the user takes some special action to acknowledge that
the user has noticed that the focus has changed.

That is up to the window manager.  Most window managers for X allow you
to set it however you like.

====================================================================

I do type watching my screen, but I am of the very opinion of the first
poster.
The keyboard focus should *not* move.

I don't know of any mean to obtain this result in fvwm2.  Even the
SkipMapping style keeps my desktop from changing to Desk 3 when Netscape
is started, but doesn't prevent it from stealing keyboard focus.
This is only one of many examples.

Could a feature like that be implemented?
I think this would be a really nice touch.

Currently, fvwm2 never frees the colors used in icons.  I've done some
experimenting, and so far,  the technique to  free the colors used  by
the Xpm library eludes me.

However, I did write  a patch to fvwm2   a while back that  limits the
colors used  in icons.  This  patch is supposed  to appear in the next
version of fvwm2.  Let me know if you want it before then.

Hello everyone.  I am a member of a group that is attempting to create a
graphical interface for setting up fvwm, but we have hit the following
snag:  we are unable to restart fvwm from a prompt.  Any recommendations
would be appreciated.

Thank you

Assuming I understand what you're looking for, the FvwmCommand module
in the extras directory should give you what you want.

I have a 2Mb S3 and Xfree3.2, with fvwm 2.0.46.  
Put the following into .fvwm2rc :-

# Need this to get window outlines with bpp > 8.
XorValue -1

This will cause reverse-video outlines to appear when you drag windows larger 
than
the OpaqueMove size defined in your .fvwm2rc.

Hope this helps,

	Have you seen my FvwmConf ?
http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~lapeyre/fvwmconf
It is a 'graphical interface for setting up fvwm' .

	I see that there have been a few connects over the past month from
engin.umich.edu

	If you want to help develop it, I would welcome it.  I could help
explain or document it.  Since it is a first go at it, it may need a lot
of rewriting, I don't know.  If you want to go a different direction, you
may find some interesting pieces or ideas in it anyway (its GPL'd) . This
said,  I think FvwmConf works pretty well !
	
	As for restarting, I just send 'Restart' down the pipe .  FvwmConf
has a command line entry box.  Just now, I  typed Restart to make sure. 

	You have probably also seen the dotfile generator, which also has
an fvwm2 module. (link on my page)  It has some good ideas. ( I havent
looked at it for a while.)

Hi all...

   At work I use fvwm 2.0.46 while at home I am using 2.0.45.

   I was moving windows around using FvwmPager and 2nd button of my
   mouse (by clicking on the window icon in the Pager and dragging it)
   that I noticed if I moved an xterm window, which is in a 'window-shade'
   state, after the drag has been completed the xterm window will display
   one (1) line!  Almost as if the xterm had been resized to display
   one line only.

   I can not reporduce this behavior here at home with 2.0.45; thus, I
   assume this might be a new 'bug' introduced in the latest release.

   Comments?

Patrick K ...
