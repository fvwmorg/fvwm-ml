  Hi,

I looked through the archve for an answer for this, but didn't find
anything concrete (well, no actual answer).

I got fvwm2.0.46 running on an SGI Indy, which has a 24-bit display. Thing
is, it gives a Cannot Allocate Colormap Entry error quite a bit, xterms
and gradients get colourless, etc. 

Now, I know Irix's X server allows different apps to have their own
colourmap _and_ colour, uh, depth, or visual type. And apparently fvwm
isn't using the right one. Does anyone know how to tell it it's supposed
to use TrueColor?

			Bye,

				-Yaron.

  Sometimes when I exit FVWM2 the entire system freezes up and must be
rebooted (just like Windoze!). There may be a relationship to Netscape
which is usually exited just before leaving FVWM. Someone mentioned a
memory leak with respect to Netscape 4.X. Is this the culprit? Is there a
cure?  I use Linux 2.0.30 and a fairly recent edition of FVWM2.  I don't
know where to look for the version/release number.

  Hi,

I run a lot of apps through XTerms, usualy opening about 5-10 xterms and
running lots of different apps on them throughout the day/week/month
(however long it is till something reboots me!). Anyway, as you can
imagine, the taskbar gets really cluttered (lots of XTerms plus lots of
other apps). I have most of my common tasks aliased so they change the
xterm title when they run, so I can more easily find them on the taskbar
(ie, when you run pine it changes the title to "Pine", when you exit, back
to "XTerm"). But what I'd really like is the miniicon on the taskbar and
the window to change.

I've setup different miniicons for just about everything I run, but so far
the only way I've found to change them after fvwm has started up is to
restart fvwm... which takes time (it's an old computer) and, heh, messes
up the order windows are listed on the taskbar. 

Does anyone have a better way of doing this? I'm using fvwm2.0.46, with
the FvwmTaskBar that comes in the extras dir (I've modified it so it sees
my mailbox in $HOME/Mailbox).

Really hope this makes sense, I'm writing this half asleep. (:

			Bye,

				-Yaron.

Hello everybody,

I wonder is it possible to do an "iconify all" to minimize all windows in
fvwm 1.24r? It will be nice if there are also options to undo it, to do it
to only a page or a desktop.

Thank you.

You should use recapture instead of restart to update the miniicons.
It's almost as annoying, but not as drastic as a restart and I'm
pretty sure it won't change the order of your icons.  Unfortunately
there's no way (yet) to have an icon be updated on the fly.  In theory
it could be done with an FvwmCommand monitor if there wasa way to do a
recapture of a single window.

``fvwm2 --version'' does the trick.  Mine reports ``2.0.46''.

With regards to memory leaks, I have not observed growing memory usage 
by fvwm2 and I often run it many days (no logout, just locked screen,
home environment).  However, you may be using different modules.

You can check memory usage by doing a ``ps axv'' just after you
started fvwm2 and then every few hours.
This might be handy: ``ps axv | egrep -i "fv\\wm|PID TTY STAT"''

Netscape should just crash without bringing the entire system down
because it runs in user space.  However, I have encountered the odd 
crash with older versions of Netscape that bring the Xserver down.  I
never had to reboot though.  Presumably, Netscape triggers a bug in
the Xserver for that to occur. 

I encountered behaviour like the one you describe on my system about a
year ago.  It went away when I upgraded my Xserver.  I think the
Xserver, if it is buggy, potentially can bring the OS down because it
runs SUID root.  The latest Xservers apparently can run in user space.
You'll have to check at <http://WWW.XFree86.org/>.

I think I remember something like this from a while back, and the problem
being that IRIX's Xserver automatically alocates all the colors available
for programs. I don't know why, but it does. I'm sorry I don't know of a
fix, but maybe this will help. 

Does anyone know of a way to force fvwm to use colors whether they're
there or not?

Change /var/X11/xdm/Xservers to

Works fine for me on IRIX 5.3, 6.2, and 6.3...

Subject: FVWM: FvwmButtons background pixmap over mini-apps
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I use pixmaps from the Tile of the Day web page as backgrounds for my
FvwmButtons button bar.  For the items that are just icons it's great,
but for the four (non-fvwm-module) applications I run in the buttons
(AfterStep apps:  asclock, ascd, asmixer, asmodem), the part of the
background pixmap that's *not* under the smallest rectangle that
encloses the app doesn't show up until I do a screen refresh (or a
window refresh on the button bar).

It's just an annoyance, but is there a way to get the button bar to
refresh itself or show up correctly to start with?

We are writing an X-based application where we create and use our own private 
colour map.  I have read and understood about the reasons why we will get colour  
flashing on a machine that does not have hardware support for a number of colour 
maps, and we have taken measures to reduce this flashing.

However, I do not understand why we get colour map flashing when changing focus 
between windows in our own application.  Note that our application exclusively 
uses the private colour map and does not reference the default colour map at 
all.  The reason seems to be that when the window manager reparents our windows 
( on a map ) the window manager window references the default colourmap.  
Therefore, when we change focus the window manager installs the default colour 
map to draw its windows, and then installs the private colour map to draw our 
windows.  This leads to the colours flashing when changing focus.  Is there an 
underlying reason why the window manager does not use the colour map of the 
window it is reparenting, or is there some sort of resource we can set so that 
it does ?


Yours faithfully,

Nick Yates.

This problem description sounds like a similar we encountered here 
at Picker a month or two ago.  We don't run our product apps under 
FVWM (only a few enlighted souls have seen the light so far :-), but 
if Nick's situation is indeed the same as ours, the root cause lies 
in X, not FVWM.

A couple of my co-workers investigated this for a few days.  The 
explanatory mail distributed by one of them has a few paragraphs 
which summarize the issues fairly well.  The excerpt:

    <product-specific background omitted>

    ... Xt's support for non-default visuals is not completely transparent.  
    Shell widgets, which determine which visual it and its child widgets come 
    up in, don't seem to intelligently inherit all four of the visual-related 
    resources (visual, depth, colormap, and borderPixmap) from ancestor widgets.  
    Too bad too, because we could then just set this up on the unrealized app 
    shell, and be done with it.  

    X FAQs confirm this odd behavior, and also confirm that to be safe, one
    should explicity set the visual-related resources on all child shells if
    running on a non-default visual is to be supported.


Nick, I hope this is the info for which you're looking.  If not, the "delete" 
option is only a flick of the wrist away.  (C'est la vie.)

I am new at using fvwm. My system is running Slackware Linux 2.0.30 and I
installed and started to run X only a month or so ago. 

My question is the following: is there a way to make fvwm start a lock
screen program automatically after a certain period of inactivity at the
console (something similar to a password-protected screen saver in
windoze).

Thank you,


MGL

To be short: nope.
This can probably be done with X somehow, but it is not an Fvwm feature.

This is not a FVWM issue, but you can use xautolock to invoke xlock after
a certain period. Both programs (xautolock and xlock) can be found at
sunsite (sunsite.unc.edu). You can start xautolock using your .fvwmrc file
so that everytime you log in, xautolock is run automatically:
...
AddToFunc InitFunction
...
+       "I"     Exec    xautolock 
...

Hi good people,

Is it possible to make a window of particular TITLE say "Error in Save"
not appear on the fvwm manager. I mean, either the window should
not be displayed OR let it be displayed, but FVWM should close
it automatically.

Can I do it ? I appreciate your help.

Maurice

This is nothing to do with the window manager. You want to get
xscreensaver, from http://people.netscape.com/jwz/xscreensaver/.

Can Slackware do RPMs? If so you could try the precompiled RPM from
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-5.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/.

Cheers

I wisth  my application to participate to Destroy  Toplevel shell under
fvwm.
I look into fvwm source code, but I could only find reference to the
atom WM_DELETE_WINDOW, this caters for Delete option under the System
menu
attached by the window manager to all X11 applications including mine.
I can easily participate to WM_DELETE_WINDOW case.
But I could find any atom related to Destroy.
My temporarily solution to prevent destroy is comment out refrence to
Destroy in my
 personnal fwmrc.
Can anybody help to do the same thing programmatically using tk.
The WM_DELETE_WINDOW case can be solved under tk.
by
wm protocols topleveshell WM_DELETE_WINDOW functionTobeinvoked.
I was hpoing to do the same thing for Destroy. But there is not an atom
called WM_DESTROY_WINDOW.

My Linux system is running a reasonalby recent version of FVWM based on
a reasonably recent version of X-Window. There is the following strange
behaviour.

If I shut down an application and then shut down FVWM before the
application actually exits then the whole system freezes. It happens
frequently with Netscape but yesterday it happened when a scanner
operation was still in the process of exiting. The distinguishing
characteristic seems to be an application that takes its own sweet time
about shutting down. My current workaround is to wait (impatiently)
until all disk activity ceases.

I need to exit FVWM/X Window frequently because my system has only 16MB
of real memory and I do run out on occasion.

Any thoughts? Is there another list I should be bugging about this?

Any replies appreciated.

Hello,

I was just wondering if it was at all possible to restart my .fvwm2rc file
from the command prompt instead of using the builtin menu option?!

Thanks,

How's your swap space? You might want to have from 16-32MB of swap
maybe which helps out quite a bit.
I forgot what the general rule of thumb for swap space was.
Something like creating a swap space twice as big as the amount of
ram you have when you don't have much. If you have the disk space
try 32MB.

There is FvwmTalk which opens a window where you can type Fvwm
commands.  I think there is also FvwmConsole which might or might not
be nicer, but in principle it does the same thing.

Hi,

    I recently installed Linux on machine and I am running FVWM.  The
only problem I have is
when I telnet into another machine (like SGI or IBM) the backspace does
not seem to work.
On the SGI it gives me a new line and on the IBM I have to do stty erase
? to get it to work.
I tried using xmodmap -e "keycode 22=backspace" and it does not work?
I dont have this
problem with FVWM95.  Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.  Thank you
very much.

Is there a FVWM2 binary that I can just tar xvfz and run? 

I dont know about 'make' or c programming, yet.  many instructions expect
this sort of thing, when they talk about libraries, and Imake, and
makefiles - apparently it is only a reference to a whole other procedure . 

If there a clear explanation of make (one that assumes I'm no programmer)
tell me - I dont mind reading.

I have Slackware installed; 2.0.29

Probably, somebody using the same OS can give you a binary.

If you're not a programmer, don't bother make, c and such.
You won't understand a word of it.
And what's more, you will have to make changes to makefiles and probably even
to the source code just to get it running on your specific system.
If you're using Linux anyway, it won't hurt (not to say it's crucial) learning
how to program in C.

Good luck.

Actually, I'd say go for it now and learn how to compile and build.
It's usually pretty simple:

(possibly) edit a config file
then the following commands:
   xmkmf -a
   make
   make install
   make install.man

Most of the time you get to sit and watch it work and have little to
do.

Speaking of installing fvwm2.

I've been trying to do the same, and I'm not a C programmer.  By
following the INSTALL directions, I think I have it compiled and maybe
ready to go.  But I can't find where the executable went.  I've tried to
look in the configure and fvwm files, but I don't see exactly where
everything gets installed.  Is it the current directory?  I noticed much
of the files were updated (the date and time are recent).  And to top it
off, assuming everything was compiled in the . directory,  where do the
compiled libraries and other files go?  I know where the executable for
fvwm is, so I can guess that.

If anyone can work with me off line perhaps, to get fvwm2 installed in
slackware Linux, I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

Adrian

There's also FvwmCommand which lets you run FvwmCommands from the
command line.  Be aware it's in the "unsupported" extras directory
(but then, I think FvwmConsole is too) so you may have to do some work
to get hold of it.  To use it you run FvwmCommandS module from Init
and Restart functions and FvwmCommand program at the command line.  I
use it to do strange things at startup such as force my initial
Netscape window to start on Desk 5 but once Netscape is up and running
reset the style to StartsAnywhere so when emacs' browse-url-netscape
causes a url to be loaded in a new window, it pops up on whatever desk
I'm running emacs in.

bother.. experiment. That's how you learn. And don't pay attention to
nay-sayers such as above... They're part of the reason a portion of the
population doesn't understand computers.

Besides, experimentation can't hurt you. Especially if you create a test
user (something other than root) to build the program in. That way you
can't hurt the rest of the system!

BTW: If you're new to linux, maybe slackware is not the best for you.
Maybe you should try RedHat. It's more up-to-date and generally easy to
use for begginers.

I would hardly say it was close to crucial. I *barely* know how to program
in C, however even before I tried learning, I was building programs under
IRIX and SunOS4/Solaris (SGI and Sun). 

The original response is horribly malfigured in it's content. Under Linux,
FVWM shouldn't have a problem compiling. It didn't for me. As long as you
follow the directions, there should be no problem. READ ALL OF THE
README's ... That's what they are there for. And if you DO have problems,
post the error to the list and I'm sure someone will help, and you'll
learn, and maybe you'll be able to spot the next problem without asking. 

Never be afraid to learn.

answers. Enjoy!

By default, the main executable (once you run "make install") gets copied
to:

	/usr/X11/bin/fvwm2

and the modules get copied to:

	/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/

Notice the first one is a file and the second one is a directory. If you
haven't modified your system variables, your $PATH should have
/usr/X11/bin somewhere in it, and thus you should just be able to run
fvwm2. 

You are installing fvwm2.0.46, right? or fvwm1.24r? Fvwm2 is fairly stable
for alot of people, so you shouldn't worry about using it.

Try the following shell command with FvwmCommand.=20

FvwmCommand -i3 -m </dev/null | perl -ne '$|=3D1;print "windowid $1 close\n=
"
if /^(0x[0-9a-f]+)\s+window\s+Error in Save/;' > ~/.FvwmCommandC=20


In order to run this command on background, you need the latest version
1.4.4. You can find it at http://www.concentric.net/~isogai/fvwm2

   I agree with this statement.

   nonsense!

   I started with RedHat and shortly after messing with it I
   ended up DUMPING it for Slackware.

   I learned quite a bit with the Slackware system.  I believe
   it is only a myth that redhat is an "easy" system for beginners.

   But I digress... this isn't a Linux discussion list... and
   to keep with the topic ... following the instructions in the
   INSTALL filethat comes with the fvwm-2.0.*.tar.gz file
   you can get fvwm compiled and installed with no problems
   on a Linux system.

   I have done this for 3 of my systems with no problems.

   Best of Luck,

Patrick ...

     Hi all, I am running fvwm 2.46 on solaris 2.5 (Japanese), spark 10.
     
     When I exit a window my keyboard and mouse buttons are disabled and I 
     cannot use the other windows that are opened, how could that be fixed?
     
     Thanks in advance for your help.

Toshi,

I thank you for the response. But I get the following message.

/users/samk/tar/FvwmCommand>xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -I/usr/openwin/lib/config
Warning:  'LocalRoot' not set - will default to '/usr/local'
"./Imakefile", line 34: Can't find include file ../../Fvwm.tmpl
/usr/openwin/bin/imake: Exit code 2.  Stop.
/users/samk/tar/FvwmCommand>

Where can I find the Fvwm.tmpl file.

BTW, where do I find the FvwmCommand executable. Or is it a module in FVWM ?

You must have fvwm2 source first.  Un-tar FvwmCommand on "extras"=20
directory to do compilation.

This explanation is not in INSTALL file because FvwmCommand is a part of
fvwm2 distribution but I guess I should add this file since it can be
downloaded all by itself too.

I can send you excutables if your system is either HPUX 9.05 or Linux
2.0.33. Otherwise, you have to ask other people.

This occurs when either FvwmCommand server is not running or fifos=20
~/.FvwmCommandM is not created or deleted. Usually the former.
Insert =20
  +  "I" Module  FvwmCommandS

in InitFunction and RestartFunction in your .fvwm2rc

 This fvwm 2.0.46 bug is hard to describe but easy to demonstrate: go
to the top left page of your current desktop, start something that
requires manual placement, run your mouse to the left side of the
screen, and then move it vertically up or down without pausing. The
window rubber-band 'sticks' to the spot where the mouse first hit the
left side of the screen until you stop moving the mouse, in a very
distracting way. Similar effects can be had by running the mouse into
the top of the screen and then moving it sideways.

 The following small patch fixes this problem:

Hey, if I want to get flamed, I'll ask for it.

I merely wanted to point out the following:

I guess Fvwm was initially meant for Linux in the first place, so it
shouldn't be too difficult building it on a Linux box.
But on some other systems (ever tried HP-UX ?) it can be quite a bit more
difficult. You really have to modify the makefiles and even some header files
to get it working. Then I haven't even mentioned the fact that on the
HP-UX boxes over here, quite a few C libraries are missing :-(
And I can hardly imagine how one can modify C header
files or C makefiles without knowing about C, thus not knowing what you're
doing.

Then about my "don't bother" statement:
Considering the above, I reckon that asking somebody for ready-to-run
binaries is to be preferred above going through the entire compile
process if the person in question doesn't know about C.
It should, IMHO, however be the perfect occasion for starting to learn C.
And, indeed, experimenting does no harm, if you've got the time for it.
It may in fact be the best way of learning. But if you have to modify header 
files and makefiles whilst not knowing about C, you won't get very far.
But again, if Fvwm compiles on Linux as easily as you say, my statement
doesn't apply to Linux.

Next time, please think before you start swearing at people.

  Hi,

Don't know if the FvwmTaskBar is entirely on topic, but hey, it's an FVWM
module.

I have to admit, a taskbar is a wonderful idea. Really useful and all
that. Thing is, I've noticed I never use the, uh, Start button. I stopped
using it since there seems to be a bug that once you press it it remains
pressed. Anyway, I've gotten used to not having it, and was wondering if
there's any (simple) way I can remove it and use the space for another app
to dock itself. Has anyone done this, or should I hack it myself?

			Bye,

				-Yaron.

Actually, it predates Linux (or at least 'modern' Linux).  It builds well
on Linux because people that had problems submitted patches to make it
work that got integrated into the code.

It builds as well as most X programs.  'xmkmf -a;make;make install;make
install.man'.

Hi, 

Sorry if you see this the second time. Last time I got no reply, and it
was my first post to the list, I am not sure if I did it right.

I wonder is it possible to do an "iconify all" to minimize all windows in
fvwm 1.24r? It will be nice if there are also options to undo it, to do it
to only a page or a desktop.

Thank you.

We've recently acquired two DEC Alpha machines at work running RedHat and
we're having trouble with our configurations.  We all have different
setups, but most of us depend on FvwmWish to execute our various toolbars
and such.  Searching high and low I finally found the source code to
recompile for the alphas, but ended up with an explicit module rather than
a simple interpreter as I am used.  It wouldn't run, anyway.

Has anyone successfully done this that we can just grab the binary from?
Any idea on older versions of the source code?  Any options at all?
Thanks in advance.

I wasn't really trying to flame you, believe it or not. I just think it's
a really bad thing to shun anyone from Linux software installations
because they don't know C. It's bad enough that Joe Schmoe loves
microsoft, but when you shush people away from a good free alternative
simply because they can't program (which from other posts, shows that
proggraming isn't necessary) is wrong and can hurt the Linux using
audience as well...

Actually... Linux was built and based on TWM source code, and TWM source
code exhists long before Linux did. TWM was one of the first window
managers for X, wasn't it? And even then, FVWM was at 1.23 in 1994
(right?) when linux was just starting to approach 1.0 (not even 1.2). The
fact that it runs well now is a testament to the attempt to make Linux as
standards-compatible as possible.

Knowing what you're doing and programming are two different things.
Makefiles aren't all that difficult to understand once you get the hang of
it. As for HP-UX, the guy said he was a novice and just installed linux.
I doubt he'd spend thousands of $'s for an HP box + (from what you've
mentioned) broken dev. kit on top of the cost for the OS. And even if he
did have to work on this system, someone could point him to a patch (cuz
if it were really necessary, a patch would prolly exhist) and he would
learn the art of patching, _OR_ someone would help him with his problem
offline. Either way, two rather important skills.

I don't think so. Eventually, this person might decide to recompile the
kernel, and then what will he do? He's gotta start somewhere. Therefore
telling him "don't bother" is kinda harsh.

I don't remember doing any swearing.

OK, I tanked my .fvwm2rc file.

But I'm still in fvwm, so perhaps we can save it.

Is there a way to ask fvwm to dump the .fvwm2rc file? Even if it isn't
pretty, I would *really* like to have it.

Thanks,

-Jim

You didn't  get any response probably because there isn't an easy way
to do it with fvwm 1 and/or  few people are familiar with fvwm 1.

I would like to know is it possible to do some cleanup (running my own
script) before executing the built-in Quit when the user select to quit
fvwm.
For example, in the .fvwmrc file the Quit selection look like this
AddToMenu "Shutdown" \
  "Quit fvwm%mini-exclam.xpm%"        Quit

Can I do something like:
AddToMenu "Shutdown" \
  "Quit fvwm%mini-exclam.xpm%"        Exec my-program , Quit


Any help will be appreciated.

Hello,

The patch below seems to be needed to avoid invalid icon location
fields from being used when focusing to an iconified window which has
no icon window (using FvwmIconMan).  I also fixed an apparent typo
(width/height were swapped), I'm not sure the consequences of that.
I'm still not sure why you'd ever want to call SetupFrame (last line
of context in the patch).

The bug manifests itself if you create a window in one part of a desk,
and move it to a different part of the viewport.  Iconify it, putting
it into FvwmIconMan.  Now, if you have IconMan set as follows, and you
move the mouse over the button for that window, selecting it, the
viewport warps to 0,0 and the window is moved to 0,0.

Let me know if you need more information,
Greg

Check your /var/adm/syslog/syslog.log.  Hopefully, it'll have something
significant.  

How did you circumvent CDE? Since fvwm2 is running, maybe dtsession keeps
trying to reconnect to the display and failing.  Init tries to respawn the
process which fails immediately.  Check /etc/inittab for your runlevel.  I
think "who -r" on HP will give that info.

I have a very frustrating problem with a custom .fvwm2rc file I'm working
on--I can't tell if I'm failing to setup something properly or if this
could be a bug.

On my custom fvwm2 desktop, I have a 1024x768x16bp screen that is laid out
like this:  Where PPP is an FvwmPager area and BBBB is an FvwmButtons
area.

+----------+
|          |
|          |
|PPPBBBBBBB|
+----------+

I have a few buttons for quick spawning of xterms at various sizes, and I
can point and click on them to get a couple xterms up and running in no
time.

The area made available for Stick, StaysOnTop FvwmButtons and FvwmPager
modules is just enough so that the rest of the screen can accomodate four
80x25 xterms, or some similar variation such as one 80x50 and two 80x25s,
etc.  If I click four times on the 80x25 xterm icon I've placed on my
FvwmButton bar, I'll get four automaticaly placed 80x25 xterm windows.

This is exactly how I want my environment to work, BUT... Along with many
other changes[  :(  ]  I've moved the FvwmButtons and FvwmPagers area to
the top of the screen instead of the bottom.  When I attempt to click on
the 80x50 xterm window, it automatically places it on the right half of
the screen, instead of the left.  If I manually move it to the left side,
there are 2-3 pixels above and below the xterm.  This makes me think that
Fvwm2 should have, could have, placed it there, but for some reason
thought there was not enough room on the left, so it put it on the right..

+---------+  +----------+
|BBBB   PP|  |BBBB    PP|
|    XXXXX|  |XXXXX     | Left one shows what is happening, right one
|    XXXXX|  |XXXXX     | what I want to happen..
|    XXXXX|  |XXXXX     |
+---------+  +----------+

And yes, in my new environment, I've moved the FvwmButtons to the left,
FvwmPager to the right, and the space in the middle is open desktop area
avialable for icons..

Any ideas? Any?  Thanks!

  Hi,

Well, since I got no replies, I hacked it out myself (:

I never used the 'Start' button that comes with FvwmTaskBar, mainly
because the button then remained pressed, which annoyed me. Then I
figured, it's just wasting space another application could use, so I
removed it. http://zzt.tlv.co.il/tb.gif has a (rather weird) capture of
what it looks like; if anyone wants, I'll try and put together a patch.

			Bye,

				-Yaron.

 Compiling fvwm2 on a SGI Irix machine, I discovered a small mistake in
the fvwm2 code: it incorrectly assumes that a Bool is the same as a
Boolean, by declaring the same variable as 'Bool' in some places and as
'Boolean' in others. The simple fix:

--- 1.1	1998/04/13 21:42:34

 I believe this mistake can cause mysterious memory corruption and/or
core dumps in some situations.

FVWM uses Xlib but not Xt, so it ought to be restricted to using Bool, 
False, and True for binary logic.  Boolean, FALSE and TRUE are defined
for use in the Intrinsics toolkit.  As cks points out, Bool and
Boolean are different underlying types, int and char (or long)
respectively.

You can use push-away.pl script to specify windows to protect and
direction to push other windows. The script uses FvwmCommand. You can find
it at www.concentric.net/~isogai/fvwm2/fvwm2.shtml

Hi there.

I was wondering if somebody could point me towards some decent rxvt
background pixmaps.
The pictures I have now mostly make any text illegible.

Thanks in advance.

Senthil

If you are talking about the text cursor in an xterm, this is nothing
to do with the window manager.

However, the class for xterms is "XTerm", and the resource is "cursorColor"
so try this in your .Xdefaults instead (don't forget to run
'xrdb -load .Xdefaults'):

  XTerm*cursorColor: LimeGreen

This works for me (and yes, I like LimeGreen :-)


To change the prompt colour you need a terminal that supports ANSI
colour escapes, such as color-xterm (I think the xterm with X11R6.3
does this) or rxvt. You should get the GNU version of 'ls' (comes
with the GNU fileutils package) and read the docs, especially
the 'dircolors' program and rc file.

For reference, I use zsh and in my .zshrc file I have something
similar to this:

  ## make some human-readable variables of the ANSI escape sequences
  NORMAL="%{[0m%}"
  BOLD="%{[01m%}"
  RED="%{[31m%}"
  GREEN="%{[32m%}"
  YELLOW="%{[33m%}"
  BLUE="%{[34m%}"
  MAGENTA="%{[35m%}"
  CYAN="%{[36m%}"
  WHITE="%{[37m%}"

  ## blue for me, red for root
  if [ "`whoami`" = "root" ] ; then
    NAMECOLOR=${RED}
  else
    NAMECOLOR=${BLUE}
  fi

  ## set left and right prompts
  PS1="${NAMECOLOR}%m${NORMAL}%(#.#.$) "
  RPS1="${YELLOW}%~${NORMAL}"


Also take a look at  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Colour-ls.html.

I use the "Dim' button in the xv colour editor to crank down the contrast
on my favourite pixmaps. This does the trick nicely.

You may like to check out the collection of pixmaps at
http://www.tcserv.com/archive/E/Eterm-bg-all.tar.gz. In general, the
Enlightenment community are really into this stuff, so doing a bit
of surfing from http://www.enlightenment.org/ can reveal all kinds
of funky pics.

Martin Cartwright has some pics at http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/~imc/  but
I can't seem to access his server at the moment.

The rxvt home page is at http://babayaga.math.fu-berlin.de:80/%7Erxvt/
(they have their own mailing list).

Dig around in http://www.andyart.com -- he has some nice backgrounds.  They're
mostly .GIF and .JPG so you'll have to use something like XV to convert them,
but its worth it to find such a complete repository.

this is why background pixmaps are generally a bad idea for xterms... The
font for the text is too fine, and tends to be out of contrast with ANY
texture that the image might have. If you really want to look for an
image... look for one that doesn't have much detail, doesn't change color
much, and that contrasts well with the color of your font.

As far as the  font for the  text is too fine,  in general, I find all
the normal X fonts too fine.  Here are the Xresources I recommend for
xterm and rxvt:

! These are the fonts used by rxvt:
XTerm.font: 9x15bold
XTerm*font1: 6x13bold
XTerm*font2: 7x13bold
XTerm*font3: 7x14bold
XTerm*font4: 8x13bold
XTerm.boldFont: 9x15
! Regular xterm fonts:
XTerm*vt100*font: 6x13bold
XTerm*vt100*font1: 9x15bold
XTerm*vt100*font2: 8x13bold
XTerm*vt100*font3: 7x13bold
XTerm*vt100*font4: 6x13bold
XTerm*vt100*boldFont: Adobe-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--20-140-100-100-M-110-*-*

I think the use of pixmaps is a very personal issue. I like doing it, but
know lots of people who find it very distracting. I think the correct
choice of font and low contrast pics with lots of dark colours works
quite well.

I did some screenshots of my setup:

(big pics, may be slow).

I've just released FvwmIconMan version 1.2 on my webpage. Changes from 1.0:

4/14/98         Version 1.2:
                        Changed default color scheme to be black on grey.
                        Various bugfixes
                        Fixed bug where the selected window would be wrong
                                after the manager got resorted.

12/31/97        Version 1.1:
                        When drawicons option is set to "always", always draw
                                the miniicons, regardless of whether the
                                windows are iconifed (from Neil Moore). A sad
                                result of setting this is that there is no
                                visual indication of which windows are
                                iconified. Since that code is due for cleanup
                                anyway, I'll handle that later.
                        sort option now takes one of these values: name, id,
                                or none.

I found out that scanned .GIFs of the pictures on M:TG cards
(=Magic: The Gathering) sometimes make great backgrounds :-)

Does anyone know how to stop the auto screen fade in FVWM so that it does
not override my xlock screensaver?  When I lock my screen after a few
minutes the auto screen fade kicks in and my screensaver no longer
displays until the mouse is moved.

As far as I know, Fvwm doesn't have such a feature.
Try turning off screen fading from X by
xset s off

Hope this helps.

Hi folks,

I have got a really annoying problem with fvwm2.

When I switch from one window to another, on the same screen
some I get a "think black round" shaped cursor. That happens when
I launch a xterm, or when I launch a 'Preferences' window on
netscape etc., all the time....

Till I click one or two times, that curser does not vanish. And
nothing happens, no window comes when it is of that shape.

Does anybody know how do I solve the problem. I really appreciate
your time in hepling me.

I use SUN Solaris Ultra system.

 I have a situation where I want some windows to have a very minimal
titlebar, with only one button and other windows to have titlebars with
more buttons. Is there any way to achieve this in fvwm 2.0.46? I can't
see an obvious way from reading the manpage, but I may well be missing
some clever use of decors or the like.

You can do this just using Style commands. One of the options for
Style is NoButton <n>. So for example when I do this in my .fvwm?rc:

Style "*Pine"           NoButton 1, NoButton 5, NoButton 7

it makes any Pine window have only Button 3 on the title bar. (I have
buttons 1, 3, 5 & 7 by default)

Here's another titlebar question:

I'd like to have the current user, current hostname and current working
directory displayed in the titlebar of an rxvt/xterm/whatever.
Of course, this title should be updated after every cd, login/-out, su
etc.

Any suggestions ?

try this (I've got this in my .bashrc):

#set the title of an xterm to show $PWD

if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]; then
  function cd ()
  {
    builtin cd $*
    xtitle "`whoami`@${HOSTNAME%%.*}:$PWD (`date`)"
  }
  else

You may prefer to narrow your question.  There are different solutions 
according to your shell (sh, ksh, csh, bash, etc.) and OS.

For one answer, see the X faq subject 32 at
<URL:http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/x-faq/top.html>

If you'd like a complex .profile which works across several shells and

What do you do to `switch from one window to another'?  Keybinding?
With the mouse?  Do you have focus follows mouse or do you have click
to focus?

In order to get X11 to NOT fade to a blank screen when using xlockmore or
any other xscreensaver you have to use the 'xset s off' command.  Put this
command in your .xintrc and it will trun off the auto fade screen saver
for X11.

I  don't think you've provided  enough   information for a  definitive
answer, so what  I can tell you   in general is,  fvwm uses  the round
cursor to indicate that it wants you to click somewhere.

For example, if you select "resize" from a pull down menu on the root,
it doesn't  know  which window  you want to  resize.  It   changes the
cursor to a round dot until you click on a window.

When I fire up FVWM (version 2.0.45) I get an error
"no such module CursorStyle in module path......."

When I search my system there is no file called CursorStyle anywhere. Is this an
FVWM problem or an XF86 problem?

Yup ... see:

  http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/howto/Xterm-Title.html

or
  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Xterm-Title.html
(may be older, depending on when Greg last updated).


I'm working on a newer version with more terminal types and a clearer
layout, so check my site again in a week or so.

>From the `xlock' manual page othat came with xlockmore-3.13:

            By default xlock will disable the normal  X  server's

            it.  Since it is possible  to  set  delay  parameters
            long  enough to cause phosphor burn on some displays,
            this option will turn  back  on  the  default  screen
            saver  which  is  very  careful  to  keep most of the
            screen black.

Note that `-enablesaver' enables the X screensaver, and `+enablesaver'
disables it.  You can also set the corresponding resource in your
.Xdefaults file:

    XLock.enablesaver: off

That was a good example and I understand now the concept behind the
cursor type. I appreciate your initiative to help me out.

Let me explain the problem that occurs very consistently in two scenarios.

Scenario 1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Say, I invoke a xterm from the command line, say like this:
/users/samk/mib/isdn>xterm
So now a small window appears on my existing window. I hit exit on the small
window, window gets CLOSED and now cursor becomes 'round'. Then I have to
hit TWO mouse clicks, even if the mouse is right on the original window.

Scenario 2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I invoke 'Preferences' menu item in Netscpape. A window pops up. Then I hit
'Cancel' button. The Preferences window closes and cursor becomes ROUND. I have
to hit mouse button twice in order to do anything.

It always takes TWO clicks; I don't know why ? Hope you can help me thro' this.

Following is my .fvwm2rc:

This sounds like a known fvwmauto problem.  What happens is that fvwmauto
tells fvwm to raise the new xterm or the preferences window, but it's no
longer there because you closed it.  So fvwm gives you that round "select a
window" cursor.  You will probably find that if you click on a window with it,
that window will get raised.

Looks to me like you're starting TWO FvwmAuto modules, so that's why you
get two clicks.  You should only start one.

I use a fvwm2rc that comes with the 3dpixmaps archive. I noticed in
the sound/audio portion of the file an audiofvwm listed as a sound
player to use (I use splay at the moment).

I looked around for this audiofvwm and haven't found it. Anyone know if
it exists and if so where to get it?

Thanks,
Marc

Howdy all,
I was telling this guy (avid Win95 user) about Linux, X, and various
window managers. I decided to grab screens from different window managers
so he can see their flexibility.
I grabbed openwin/olvwm, mwm/Lesstif, and twm.

I can't for the life of me grab any screens while in fvwm2 though.
Started up three different configs I have to show him what you can do
with just one window manager. Whenever I try to grab a screen xv just
beeps.

Anyone have any idea what the cause may be?
Thanks,

my right mouse button keeps "locking."  The terminal behaves as if the right
mouse button is being held down.  This prevents me from being do
anything...except reboot.

Also, is it possible to place the button bar vertically on the side of the
screen than horizontally on the bottom?  (I'm using version
2.somethin'-or-other)

This is strange and I don't really know what's wrong. May not even be a
FVWM problem.

Yes, use:
*FvwmButtonsRows 1
instead of defining *FvwmButtonColumns,
and, of course, choose the right position be setting *FvwmButtonsGeometry.

I've occasionally had that problem oon my sun box, and the problem seemed
to be when I started xv on a different machine than my own.  Never did
figure out why but if I started it from my machine it worked fine.

Good idea.

Just about the 3 ugliest window managers :-)
To really impress him you should also get some shots of WMs like WindowMaker,
AfterStep, and of course Enlightenment (http://www.enlightenment.org/ ...
loads of pics there). Also a good fvwm95 or win95-lookalike of
fvwm2 might impress him if he likes windoze.

See the Window Manager page at http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/.

Keep up the evangelism :-)

Don't know ... I've never had trouble with xv, even on many many platforms.
You could use xwd in the meantime.

   Not too sure.  But I seem to have a similar problem
   here at work with fvwm-2.0.46 w/matrox millennium II 8MB.
   Whenever I try to "grab" some window or an area with xv
   I get a blank grab.  However at home  I am running same
   version of fvwm2 w/Diamond Viper v330 4MB I have no
   problems.

   The only difference between the systems are the  XServers
   (both are XSuSe servers) and the  colour depth they run
   at:  matrox @ 32bpp and diamond @ 16bpp.

Allo..

For anyone interested, I've set up a "Fvwm Themes" page with several
different 'looks' and configuration files.

http://www.VIS.colostate.edu/~scriven/Linux/fvwm/index.html

Also, is there any way to allow the mouse to scroll the screen *only*
when dragging something?

we have at least 70 terminals in this one lab...and at least a dozen labs
across campus...one has 150+.  I've had this trouble on nearly every terminal
i've used (but only when i'm running fvwm2).

OK, maybe we  are past the "hardware problem"  stage.   Yet I've never
heard anyone descibe an fvwm problem as mouse button locking.

I'm not completely   clear on the symptom.   When  I press the   right
button on my   mouse, I get  different   reactions, depending  on  the
context.  For example  on the "root", fvwm  pops up  a menu.  On  most
other fvwm2 controls, I get no reaction at all.  Within windows, I get
whatever the application does.

Whats happening to you?

Using "xev" you should see both button press and button release events.

It most often happens when i'm running netscape.  I'll right click to back
up, or download an image or whatever, and the mouse button "stick."  The box
that popped up when i right clicked stays there when i let go AND it won't
let me click on anything else, w/ any of the buttons.  The keboard hangs,
too...or at lest seems to...i can hit "Stop, A" and then "boot" to reboot the
terminal...but that's it.

I have no idea what causes it, but I've had this happen too.  I remember that
start office 3.1 caused it a bunch of times.  I think I also had some XView
app doing this.  I don't remember netscape ever doing it to me.  Star office
4.0 is out and doesn't use Motif anymore, and I haven't had that problem with
it.  Do you have this problem with another window manager?  I think it may be
related to the application grabbing the xserver and not letting go.

The only other manager i've used for more than a few minutes is mwm, and it
worked fine (but i really like fvwm2's button bar and virtual desktop).

Hey Frank,

Sometime in the late 1900s you wrote:

   I remember a similar problem.  Almost exactly as you
   described it.  You even may find a post by me in the
   fvwm2 list archives regarding this very same problem.

   For me it was with netscape.  This would ONLY occur
   when netscape was still "busy" retrieving the page
   when I would right click to go back.

   It would seem that the entire box was stuck.  But not
   so.  Netscape would have a hold on the xserver, that's
   all.  On my Linux/86 box I could switch to a virtual
   terminal/console and kill netscape from there and
   return to the X session and things would be fine.

   Another way out would be to just wait a while.  I
   think it took something like 3 to 5 minutes or so
   and then Netscape would snap out of it and let go.
   Then things were back to normal.

   I have not noticed this behavior w/Netscape 4.04
   yet.

   Hope this helps,

Patrick ...

Es hatte ja schon jemand an die Liste geschrieben, da das alte Verhalten
als Bug betrachtet und in 2.0.46 "verbessert" wurde (ich fand es auch besser,
wie es frher war). Glcklicherweise lt sich das Verhalten von 2.0.45 leicht
wiederherstellen: Alles was Du tun mut, ist im File fvwm/move.c in Zeile 256
die 0 in eine 1 ndern, das ganze sollte dann so aussehen:

#if 1
            HandlePaging(Scr.MyDisplayWidth,Scr.MyDisplayHeight,&xl,&yt,
                       &delta_x,&delta_y,False);
#else /* probably should actually use EdgeScroll values: */
            HandlePaging(Scr.EdgeScrollX,Scr.EdgeScrollY,&xl,&yt,
                       &delta_x,&delta_y,False);
#endif

(und dann natrlich EdgeScroll wieder auf 0 0)

Gru,
Thomas

FWIW I'm using XFree3.3.2 and a Mill II 4Mb, and this problem is not
evidenced (I can grab anything, no problems. Not that I often bother.)

But I'm running at 16bpp. Try changing the colour depth and see what
happens.

is fvwm still under active development or have the developers switched 
to another project (such as Enlightenment)? there hasn't been a new
release for almost a year now...

By default, my fvwm switches the focus to a new window when it first
appears.  How do you disable this behavior?  I just don't see it
among the Style options; I hope I'm overlooking something.  Looks
like it would be similar to SkipMapping...

It's still under active development. I'm actively developing FvwmIconMan, and
will certainly never switch to enlightenment. I believe that there have been
other busy module writers as well.

As far as the fvwm core, I think there is two factors: (1) Chuck Hines has
been pretty busy (the problem with free software is that the people writing it
have to pay bills too), and (2) I think we're getting close to the limit of
what can easily go into the fvwm "kernel." Most of the major changes I've
heard of of basically internal code rewriting things - like fleshing out
fvwmlib, and changing how styles are handled.

There certainly is some potentially cool areas to push fvwm into, like
extensibility, easier/more automated configuration, etc. But those are major
undertakings, and people I've talked to about it haven't really had the energy 
to take it up for real (including myself). 

I see two avenues for cool development: (1) more modules. I that most of the
unexplored potential in fvwm is in the modules (2) somebody (like yourself)
asking "Hey I don't see such and such getting done" and getting inspired to do 
it themselves. That's pretty much the way it free software always seems to
work. It's like a relay race. Some guy get a cool idea, slaps it into code,
maybe gets stuck maintaining the distribution or a few years until he
eventually runs out of insipration. Then someone else comes in and continues
the cycle. 

My personal thing I'd like to see, but don't have the time to do, is make is
so that you can write modules to control the "look and feel," like the
titlebars and menus and such. Gotta write that thesis though. If anyone else
has the urge (and skill) to help, I'd be more inclined to do it.

I think at least integrating the various patches I've seen on the
Internet (Greg Badros's patch for menus and such for one) and making
sure FVWM compiles cleanly with gcc -Wall would be nice. If someone's
willing to send me their patch and a command line for patch (I seem to
have no end of bad luck getting patches applied correctly), I'll start
slapping them on 2.0.46 and making it a little more robust (the autoconf
package cited from the FVWM homepage would be nice, too).

I captured the "ugly" managers so the guy can view them in order from
nothing (lwm - Lightweight Window Manager) on up to better looking things.

Of course I should just point him to the xwinman site and have him look
at the shots there.
Some of the other window managers I had but got rid of them for one
reason or another (KDE, AfterStep, WindowMaker). Even mlvwm (Macintosh).

Thanks for the tip. Didn't even think of xwd. Still catching up on what

I had a lot of trouble at first too. What I ended up doing was to make a new
.fvwm2rc from scratch. You can look at the old one for reference as it contains
a lot of good documentation in itself. And in the man page of course..

It's better this way because then you don't have to scroll through that HUGE
default file to change stuff and it makes it easier to learn. At least it was
for me.

Well, easiest way: steal someone else's config.

Second easiest would be to use fvwmconf or the dotfile generator
(http://soliton.physics.arizona.edu/~lapeyre/fvwmconf/ and 
http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/ respectively).

Isn't the idea for FVWM95 to look like WinNT? 
I'm working on developing a catalog of the differences between wvfm95 and NT,
the aspects of the NT interface which *cannot* be implemented in a Unix
environment. I am particularly interested in the "look and feel" differences
which can induce user problems when the behavior of the environment does not
match expectations. For instance, why do you use Motif...what are the problems
you find occurring because "FVWM95 and WinNT4.0 look just too much alike?" Any
feedback would be appreciated. Respond privately, if there is interest I will
compile the differences for the list. 
Thanks,

Hi,

Can I make a window with particular title automatically 'Close' by itself.

For example, I have a window being popped up with title "APPL ERROR" and
I want it to get closed automatically, without me hitting "OK" button.

Can anybody help me with this please.

thanks      i      i

Are you kidding?  I seriously doubt that there is anything of WindowsNT that
"cannot" be implemented in a UNIX environment.  I think it's quite the
opposite.

If there's something that hasn't been implemented, I think it's much more
likely to be because no one has spent the time doing it, not because it's
technically impossible.

Irene's message reminded me of something I would very much like to be
able to do in FVWM: Duplicate the ALT+TAB behavior of Windows 95 as
much as possible.  The closest I've been able to come is to specify

     Key Tab	A	M	Next [*] Focus

in my .fvwmrc (well, okay, .fvwm95rc, but the behavior seems to be the
same in stock FVWM), but this only seems to alternate between the two
most recent windows (most of the time, there are exceptions).  It's
close enough when I'm working with two windows, and something of a
headache if a third window comes into play.

For those unaware, Windows 95's (and it's relative Windows NT 4.0)
ALT+TAB works like this: When the ALT key is depressed, a box appears
in the middle of the screen with an icon for each window.  Keeping ALT
held and tapping TAB will advance an outline cursor within the window
to the next icon in the list.  Releasing ALT raises the window and
gives it focus.  The ordering is important too.  Non-iconized windows
are first in the list, followed by iconized windows.

Is there anything else I can try in my .fvwmrc to duplicate some of
this behavior, or should I investigate writing a module to do this?
(Starting with FvwmWinList as a starting point, of course).  I could
care less about looking like Windows 95--It's the functionality I'm
after.

Well, that's something that's always nagged at me as something I'd
like to be able to do. The trouble I've always seen is that fvwm's
keybindings don't seem to allow you to specify that it do something on
a keypress, react to other keypresses until it receives the release on
the key, and then finish up the binding... And in general, it might be
undesirable to specify that fvwm "watch" ALT keystrokes to see if it
catches a TAB... Though I suppose a different key could also be
used. I've always suspected that some fairly important parts of fvwm's
core would need to be changed to get it to emulate the Windows ALT-TAB
behavior.

I'm not even sure that a module could do what's desired, unless the
module actually ran in the background looking for key events, the way
FvwmAuto works...

Incidentally, if you're trying to emulate the Windows behavior, it's
helpful to add:

Key Tab	A	SM	Prev [*] Focus

That way you're not limited to just two windows...

i, too, would love to have alt-tab ability...but am too new to fvwm to even
attempt to implement it myself.

i'd take that one step further:  the LAST thing i want is a win95 look-alike.

while i'm on the subject:  can i use fvwm2 in place of "program manager" (i
don't think it's called that anymore, but i'll use it for lack of a better
phrase) in win95?  My Dad's buying me a computer.  It's a really good buy,
but as a consequence (sp?) i have to accept win95as the OS.

There really isn't ANYTHING that "cannot" be implemented in a Unix
environment. That's all left up to the software you're using. In fact,
most of the stuff that FVWM95 "cannot" do is better off being left undone.

Well, 
	have you seen Xclass? It's a widget set (like motif is) that has
the win95 look/feel. Check out fox.unixville.com for more information.
Otherwise, motif is dead or at least should be. It costs too much and
there are better alternatives (Xclass, GTK, etc)

Well, if there's no way that you can install linux alongside the windows
95 installation, then use the following:

	http://anandtech.com/litestep

It's afterstep for windows 95. It replaces explorer (the wm) and uses less
or as-much memory depending on the settings. 

You should really look into installing linux (one of the most popular
FREE unix-like operating systems systems available, and in most cases,
more advanced than commercial unices) on your computer. It is 32-bit true
multitasking, etc, etc... and runs on intel. You can get a Linux CD for as
little as $7 (including shipping) from www.lsl.com ... 

Once you install that, you can install any window manager you want.

ok...before anyone else tells me to install linux:  i plan on it...but not
until this summer.  i have three weeks left of classes, i know win95 (as much
as i hate to admit it), but i don't know linux, yet (in fact, i've only been
using unix for this one semester).  so as soon as the semester ends and i
have some time (<time, what a lovely thought>) i'm going to install (and
learn) linux.

in the mean time: i've tried afterstep and didn't like it, that's why i'm
using fvwm2, so i'd like to be able to use on my new pc until i get linux.

Well, as far as I know, the only windows shell replacement that is
available is litestep. What don't you specifically like about afterstep
that cannot be modified? 

The reason I say this is because noone is porting fvwm2 to windows95/NT. I
know someone is porting FVWM95 (or trying to) but I really don't see the
point and am not even sure if they started or not. It's a real job to
change the window handling protocols from X11 to windows. Therefore, If
you don't like afterstep, then don't really expect to find anything else.

There really shouldn't be much difficulty making afterstep look similar to
fvwm2 (I mean, afterstep DID start as fvwm1 + some mods).

redhat is nice and easy and $40-50 if you order the commercial version. If
you order it from www.lsl.com (the free version which doesn't come with a
commercial Xserver and commercial web browser -- Red Barron) it'll cost
you less. In fact, you can order EACH of the distributions (They call
their package "Tri-Linux") plus S/H for under $10. Not a bad deal. 
If you want to wait a bit, Netscape wants to create a distribution of
Linux which will compete with Windows NT. That should be interesting :)

In anycase, as a bit of warning. Expect to eventually trash your first
installation of linux if you're a newbie. Everyone does. Mine was with an
accidental recursive delete from the root directory. :)

I think Red hat is great. But i love Caldera's Open linux. I have tested
it, and it is the best!
Fvwm rules. Anyone know of a place to get it for Windows? I hate windows,
but it runs all of my programs.

 Then there's always the question of how much development fvwm2 needs.
I think it would be nice for 2.0.46 plus patches to be declared the
stable version and released for real, dropping out of its pseudo-beta,
but I don't know how many more features the core (as opposed to the
modules) really needs.

 It can be counterproductive to pile feature on feature just to do new
releases; there's nothing wrong with stable old software if it works.

 If there are specific fvwm2 features one wants, one might want to speak
up about them and/or contributed patches to do them.

I want to get Eric's fvwm2rc file to work, but I am getting error :
No such module BorderStyle.

All I can find of borderstyle, is an obsolete Link in the archive, and
reference to it being a compile time option but then no instructions on
choosing it.

Also, the "ButtonStyle All -- Flat " command appears to be wrong.
So, I need help.

I got a little bit more of the desired behaviour by using FvwmIconMan.
Here are the relevant parts of my .fvwm2rc:

Key Tab		A	M	Module FvwmIconMan Transient

*FvwmIconMan*action	Key Tab    A bif Next 3, gotobutton 0, select, ret, gotobutton Next, select
*FvwmIconMan*action	Key Return N sendcommand "Iconify -1, Focus, WarpToWindow 42p 10p"
*FvwmIconMan*action	Key Escape N quit
#
*FvwmIconMan*transient*buttongeometry	420x0
*FvwmIconMan*transient*action	Key Return N sendcommand "Iconify -1, Focus, WarpToWindow 42p 10p", quit


This shows a list of windows under the mouse cursor if you hit (and
release) Alt-Tab.  Then, you can cycle through the list with Tab and
select a window with Return.  You shouldn't use Alt-Tab to cycle
through the windows, because fvwm sees this and tries to start another
FvwmIconMan.  Maybe one can avoid that by dynamically reconfiguring
the key bindings, but I didn't bother.

As was already said, it's probably necessary to change fvwm's
internals to make it react on the pressing of Alt alone, and I'm not
sure if I really want to use my Alt key for a single feature.

Hope this helps,
Rainer

Sorry I didn't respond yesterday, but I was out sick.

Please don't put out a patched up 2.0.46.  It causes even more
confusion when people start sending email to the list with problems -
it's hard enough now to get people to say what version they have, let
alone is it patched up version A put out by so and so, or their own
patched up version from the unofficial patches directory or whatever
else.  It's bad enough that we still see fvwm95 questions on the
lists...

I already have a collection of the patches that I believe should go
into 2.0.47 and am putting them togther (slowly).  Some of the patches
are different than the originals posted.  Fvwm *IS* still under
development, admittedly not as rapidly as I would like, and
2.0.47 is almost ready.  Certain things in my life have been taking
even more time than normal over the past couple of months, but it
looks like things will clear up a little after this upcoming weekend
so I should have some more time to get back to working on fvwm and
perhaps get 2.0.47 out before too much longer.

is there any way to trap the maximize button (^) in the corner of each window
so that it will the whole screen EXCEPT for the part taken up by by the
button bar.  The default is fill the whole screen (or least, almost the whole
screen).

Just to clarify what behavior you're seeking - 

Suppose your button bar was in the upper-left corner of the screen, and 
your window was well below and to the right of it.  Would your zoom stop 
at the bottom edge or the right edge of the button bar?  

Would this change if your button bar was vertical instead of horizontal?  

What if the window overlapped the button bar before zooming?  

What if the button bar were floating in the middle of the screen and the 
window completely covered it before zooming?  (I know, it's a pathological 
case, but there's plenty of pathological users out there...)

If the window was zoomed and butting up against the button bar and the 
button bar got moved or resized, would the window resize to accomodate?  

If the button bar got killed, would zooming revert to full-screen zoom?

What if, for some reason, the user had more than one button bar on the 
screen?


Basically, what all the above amounts to is, can your proposed zooming 
algorithm handle all possible initial shapes and placements of both the 
button bar and the window, and does it handle any dynamic activity of 
those things before and afterward?

Just wondering,

i have no idea.

right now i just have a slightly modified default button bar.  it fills the
bottom edge of my screen.  i want to eventually make it vertical on the right
side...but i haven't got the time right now (exams week after next...'nuf
said).

as for all those other options, i don't see myself using them (though
anything is possible), so all i really care about right now is the two
configs i'm looking at.

here's a puzzler.  fvwm2 reacts differently to mouse and keyboard inputs
depending on whether or not num lock is on.

when numlock is ON, '^ + arrow keys' moves me around the virtual desktop and
'^ s' saves my document (in a text editor/word processor--which is what it's
supposed to do).

when num lock is OFF, '^ + arrow keys' moves me around my document (like it's
"supposed" to [at least imo]), and '^ s' prints '<dc3>' to screen at the spot
where my cursor is.

also, FvwmIconMan doesn't work when num lock is on.

is all this normal behavior?  if not, how could it have happened, and how can
i fix it?

I see this every few hours so finally broke down and built FvwmAudio
with -ggdb to get a decent core:

#0  0x8048f85 in Loop (fd=0x6d65622f) at FvwmAudio.c:413
413                 if ((count = read(fd[1],header,
(gdb) print count
$1 = -1073743996
(gdb) list
408             int             body_length,count,count2=0, total;
409             long            code;
410
411             while (1)
412             {
413                 if ((count = read(fd[1],header,
414                                   HEADER_SIZE*sizeof(unsigned long))) <= 0)
415                     done(0);
416

Ah, well, it hasn't completed the read, so I guess that's why count
is bogus...

But let's look a little deeper:
(gdb) print fd[1]
Cannot access memory at address 0x6d656233.
(gdb) print fd[0]
Cannot access memory at address 0x6d65622f.

Hrrrm... that smells like ASCII.

(gdb)  x/32c &fd-32

Id looks like fd[] is being overwritten by:
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'DestroyStyle' in
ModulePath '/usr/X11R6....

(Yeah, yeah, but I was having fun rearranging the configs so I could
swap my entire look and feel on the fly without doing a reload, just
a recapture...)

Anyway, it seems that there is an interesting overflow bug in FvwmAudio.
Anyone fixed it yet or should I break out bounds-checking gcc on it?

it's not much of a puzzler. fvwm2 does not handle the keyboard itself, 
X does. how your X server sends keypress events is dependent on the
server. with XFree86, the num lock key does modify some keys, usually
the other modifiers: alt, ctrl, etc.

so, yes it's normal.

This works for me:


DestroyFunc Do
AddToFunc Do		"I"	$0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

*FvwmAudioPlayCmd Do
*FvwmAudio add_window	   'Next ["APPL ERROR"] close'

Module FvwmAudio


if you want some delay, you can replace "I" with an "M" 
-> fvwm awaits the motion timeout and then executes the command.

you can of course also start a shell command via exec, wait any time,
then send the close-command to fvwm via FvwmPipe.
But this is somewhat complicated and might be a bit slower due to the
shell startup.


Did I already tell you, that I do love interpreters ;^)




But wait, this inspired me to expand FvwmAudio into a generic
FvwmEvent module. Will be released soon.





you could also experiment with FvwmAuto, but I don't think you'd get
such a pretty solution.

FvwmAuto man page:

       Module FvwmAuto Timeout [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

...

       EnterCommand  and LeaveCommand are optional.  EnterCommand
       is executed Timeout milliseconds after a window  gets  the
       input focus, LeaveCommand is executed Timeout milliseconds
       after the window has lost focus.

       "Raise" is the default for  EnterCommand,  but  any  fvwm2
       function  is allowed. I would not use "Close" or "Destroy"
       with a low timeout, though.


you could experiment with 

AddToFunction close_if_error "I" Next ["APPL ERROR"] close
(don't know if the "if" command is already implemented and if, then if it's
implemented in your version)

FvwmAuto 0 close_if_error




Plans for combining FvwmAuto and FvwmAudio into one generic module are on
my todo since 1996, but I never got around to it)

I was trying to install the nextify-bigcolor patch posted by
mat006@pinon.ccu.uniovi.es to this list on the 14th November last year, and
it doesn't work because the patch is screwed up - specifically, it's
missing the sfx.h and hashtable.h files (which are new in that patch).

Does anyone have a version of this patch which works? Did I miss a fixed
patch or something?

Howdy boys 'n girls.

	I think fvwm2 is the best windowmanager ever but
there is one thing that annoys me. That is the way
EgdeScroll works. I started to look around the source
a little. What i would like to do is to make EdgeScroll
only change desktop when the pointer is on the edge of
the screen AND i'm "carrying" a window with me. I don't
like scrolling of the screen accentially and I don't think
EdgeResistance is a good enough tool to solve it.

What i've been looking at is virtual.c and move.c.
I tried some changes and i succeeded in doing the opposite
thing that i wanted. :P That is scrolling only when i'm NOT
"carrying" a window, but i've not succeeded with what i want.

If anyone on this mailinglist know the sourcecode good or
would like to help me solve this little problem i'd be
very greatful. I guess it should be rather easy if you
know the source well.

Greatful for any help i can get with this.

Laters dudes.

i've seen several posts about problems w/ edge-scrolling.  What is
edge-scrolling?  My screen NEVER scrolls, so i have no clue what u guys are
talking about.  (Plus, i just got fvwm2 about a month ago and have had NO
time to play w/ it).

can it be explained in a few words?  or is it something i should look up
somewhere?  (again, i'm a relative newbie).

[I checked the list archives for this, and turned up quite a few posts
 asking the same question, but no answers to those posts seemed to be
 present in the archives. :-(]

I've a Solaris 2.5.1 box with CDE installed, I want to get fvwm as the
default window manager on it, when I login form the CDE login
screen. Does anyone have any pointers as to how this can be achieved? 

Thanks for any help,
Viren

Viren,

Let me describe what I'm doing.

1. Select a command line login from the CDE login window.
2. Hit return once and get good old tty login ("hostname login:").
3. Login
4. Run openwin. You need to make sure that you have a ~/.xinitrc file and run
   fvwm from this file (/path/to/fvwm2). Openwin will start the X server for you
   and will start with your specific application reading this file. The window
   manager is just another program (like xterm or xclock) from that point of
   view).
5. I also put a soft link from my ~/.xinitrc to ~/.xsession since some (old)
    XDM login tools are looking for this file instead.


Good luck,
Yehuda.

I have a Solaris 2.6 box with CDE.  The only thing I use of it is the
login screen, since it gives me an option to use the good (?) old
openwin environment.  When openwin starts, it checks if You have an
.xinitrc file and executes that to start the window manager and some
related stuff.

If .xinitrc doesn't exist in your homedir, openwin uses
/usr/dt/config/Xinitrc.ow (at least on my system), so it's probably
best to copy that to .xinitrc and modify it to use fvwm.

I also managed to use fvwm2 under CDE (not openwin), but then I can't
do anything for the first minute after the login.  I assume that
someone waits for some signal from the window manager which fvwm2
doesn't send.

Hope this helps,
Rainer

This works really slick:

in your ~/.Xdefaults file put:

*wmStartupCommand:  /path/to/fvwm/executable/fvwm2
*waitWmTimeout: 1

Then when you log in, this will automatically fvwm2 as your window
manager.

Subject: FVWM: Twm-style Button3 placement patch for 2.0.46
Date: 	Thu, 23 Apr 1998 18:19:44 -0400
From: Chris Siebenmann <cks@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu>

 The following patch adds twm-style button 3 placement to window
placement. When manually placing a window, you can click Button3 and the
window will be placed where it is and either extended down to the bottom
of the screen or truncated at the bottom of the screen (if its bottom
is off the bottom of the screen). I don't know enough about how fvwm2
keyboard shortcuts are implemented to know if they can be used for this,
or if you'd have to use a real mouse button.

 Comments, feedback, etc is welcome.

The pre-condition is that you have configured fvwm2 to give you a virtual
desktop.  E.g. ``DeskTopSize 2x3'' gives you a virtual screen 2
physical screens wide and 3 physical screens high.

The ``fvwm2'' man page covers all the details.  Search for ``desktopsize'',
``edgescroll'' and ``edgeresistance''.

My personal setup includes:

## Virtual desktop size in units of the physical screens.
DeskTopSize 2x3

## Amount of Resistance for moving from desk to desk with the
## mouse ... 0 0 allows for only window moves and resizes to
## reach into the next desk.  mSec, pixels
EdgeResistance 500 150

## Percentage of a page (horizontal, vertical) to scroll when the 
## cursor reaches the edge of a page ... 0 0 turns off scrolling
EdgeScroll 100 100

Sorry, can't help with the source.

However, are you aware that you can move windows around on the pager's 
display by grabbing them with the middle mouse button?  This is usually
simulated by pressing both buttons on 2-button mice.

Combined with ``EdgeScroll 0 0'' that should be very close to what you 
want to achieve.

In fvwm95, u can close a window by clicking on the 'x' in the corner.  Is it
possible to emulate this behavior in fvwm2?  (the exact location of the
button is irrelevant, what's important is tto be able to single-click rather
than double-click.)

that did it still running too?

eg

spxgm    27881   S 12:21:02  0:20 netscape -install 
spxgm    27880   S 12:21:01  0:00 /bin/tcsh -c netscape -install
spxgm    27735   S 11:47:25  0:00 /bin/tcsh -c xbiff
spxgm    27747   S 11:47:31  0:00 xbiff

p.s. anyone out there working on getting buttons to swallow the pager iconified
or the pager to have an option the show only current desk?

Try something like this:

DestroyFunc	"RunExec"
AddToFunc	"RunExec" \
  "I"	Exec exec $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9


DestroyMenu	"Applications"
AddToMenu	"Applications" \

Hi FVWM2 Users,

I've got strange problem with FVWM2-2.0.45 on my Linux computer.  I have
the next two lines in my ~/.fvwm2rc file:


Style "*"               SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement

and

Style "rxvt"            ActivePlacement


These two lines are mean the next: i would like start rxvt application
with ActivePlacement mode and others will be RandomPlacement.

So, then i try start rxvt application nothing will happen with active
placement of rxvt's window.  But i will get invitation to place rxvt if
rxvt application will be the third one on the screen.  It doesn't matter
how i start rxvt application, from FVWM menu or from XTERM like
console.  So if i have got more then two copy of rxvt application on the
screen, then ~/.fvwm2rc lines are worked correctly.  This problem will
appear if i will try set for another application the same, for example
EMACS or XTERM.  Random placement work for all another application (if
number of rxvt copies less then two, RandomPlacement is used).

The question is, is it bug or i missed something?

Try adding DumbPlacement to the rxvt style as well.  I believe styles ar logically ORed, 
so this may be needed.

        It took me a while to figure out how to duplicate this...

        The problem here is that you're using some version of mousey-focus
(MouseFocus or SloppyFocus), which butts heads with window list circulation
when you cycle to a window that happens to lie under the mouse cursor. The
FocusFollowsMouse policy takes precedence when FVWM tries to decide where
to assign focus, and this messes up the cycling order. When you cycle to a
window that's under the mouse cursor, try moving the mouse cursor out of
the window onto the desktop, then try to continue cycling with Alt-Tab
(or whatever key combo you'd like to use).

        The code may be slightly buggy: this aberration in the cycling
order only seems to happen when you're switching to a different desktop
or page and land on a window under the mouse cursor. I haven't looked at
this area of the code in a good while, and my memory of it is a bit hazy,
so I can't comment on whether this is really a bug without looking into it
a bit more. But move the mouse and you should be able to continue cycling
through all the windows.

        All this does is to give you *another* keyboard shortcut to circulate
through the list backwards with Shift-Alt-Tab. It's a very nice convenience,
but it doesn't alter the behavior that started this thread. (Well, it may
appear to, since you may be able to get to more windows by traversing the
list in reverse. Then, again, you may not.)

DB ? >> ...

        Finally, the original poster (Dave, I think) mentioned having a window-
list window pop up. Is there something about the plain old WindowList command
that you don't like, apart from its not having icons? Try this binding:

        Key Tab          R       M       WindowList

(change the "R" to an "A" if you prefer). You can scroll through the popup
list with the cursor movement keys and then hit Enter, or just click directly
on the window you want to go to. I think this is much quicker than Windows'
approach, since I can select the target window with whatever's closest to
my right hand...and it gives you more information about the windows.

when you start an app in your rc file does it say

"I" netscape 
	or
"I" Exec netscape

	the second is the one you should be using.

 Hello,

  I have one panel on which I have about 30-90 netscape windows 

 * exacly on top of each other *   ... I.e. they have same geometry.

 Now to switch into that panel is not a problem -- only the window on the
top displays . But when I'm switching off of that panel to another
pannel, it takes ages and a lot of blinking into my eyes (quite
disturbing), as all the 30-90 netscape windows get displayed and unmapped,
displayed and unmapped, displayed and unmapped, ...  And it takes a lot of
time and CPU time to get off of that pannel. How can I fix it ? How can I
tell fvwm2-2.0.46 that it 

  i) either shouldn't map a window until any part of it is required for a
display, or
 ii) when unmapping a window due to a panel switch, don't send display
messages to windows, since we are going off that panel anyway, or
iii) should unmap the lowest window first, and the top one last

  I think any of the three above would solve my problem. Wouldn't they ?

  How else might I solve my problem ?

   Please reply to honza@ied.com,fvwm@hpc.uh.edu since I'm not subscribed.

      Thanx,

           Jan

Hi all,

  I have three buttons on my fvwm title bar: 
(1)Function, (4)Iconify, (2)Close.
I'd like to omit some of them for certain applications or
modules like:

Defaults: 1, 4, 2
FvwmButtons: none
TkDesk: 1, 4
Xclock: 1, 2
...

How can I do this?

Thanks in advance!

Use the Style NoButton option. Edit your .fvwmrc (or .fvwm2rc or
whatever it's called) and add/modify the following lines:

Style "FvwmButtons" NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4
Style "TkDesk" NoButton 2
Style "XClock" NoButton 4

Has anybody been thinking about introducing something like TCL in
fvwm=2E To me it looks like most current fvwm commands can be translated
directly to TCL commands=2E This would automatically add

- all the usual programming constructs like if, while, for and procedures

- data structures, though only the ones supported by TCL, i=2Ee=2E lists

- if we add TCL/tk too, we would be able to do all sorts of things
currently done through some of the modules, like FvwmForm and the
newly announced FvwmEvent=2E

Some of the concepts of fvwm configuration files can be generalized to
the corresponding concepts of TCL or TCL/tk, e=2Eg=2E functions, colors,
menus=2E=2E=2E

And some of the fancy configuration options such as M4, can be done
away with, so we will have much more adaptive configurations=2E

I can put some work into this, though not enough for a complete
rework=2E=2E=2E

What do you think? Will it work? Anybody out there want to help?

I don't want to discourage you and I don't want to start a flame war
either.  

However, my experience has been that tcl/tk is excellent for small
appletts but not for medium or large applications.  All the larger
tcl/tk based apps that I know of (tkdesk, tkinfo, and a few I can't
remember now) are too buggy to rely on.  That is surely due to the
absence of data-types and type checking in the language.

There is a fvwm derived project (scwm) that uses scheme (lisp?) as a
scripting language.

My suggestion would be to look at ``slang'', which I believe is some
sort of C-interpreter.  I don't know how good it is, but it is used in
the ``jed'' editor for example.

[paragraphs moved to beginning for readers uninterested in Tcl]

In any case, my major concern with Tcl as a window manager (and
especially if it tries to do module things in the same process) is
that it's not multithreaded yet.  I *really* don't want my window
manager to hang if its built in pager (or something) goes into a loop.

I don't think it's a silly idea, necessarily, but it requires some
thought as to what the goals are.  And looking closely at scwm surely
makes sense.

exmh is one of the best mail readers out there.  Personally, I use
Gnus, but exmh is solid.  There's also a Tcl web server (tclhttpd),
which seems pretty robust.  And tkman is a superb manpage reader:
anybody that still uses xman definitely ought to try it.  (None of
these are trivial applications, either.)  

Closer to home, <URL:http://www.isode.com> uses Tcl based management
tools for its directory and messaging products, and our LDAP/WWW
gateway is basically Tcl.  We find it relatively robust.

Possibly, or perhaps it's just that the applications are trying to do
ambitious things and haven't had enough maintenance effort yet.

Two comments:
1. I don't want fvwm to go down the road of some other projects where various
   people slap an interpreter for every language known to man in it (vim comes
   to mind). If we want to put an extension language in it, I think we should
   pick one and stick with it. I believe that multiple languages usually need
   be supported only because people are too lazy to learn a new language, or a 
   mistake was made when choosing the first language supported. 

2. I personally think tcl is a poor choice for such a job. Like perl, it never
   seemed (to me) properly suitable for large scale projects (although it's
   not nearly as write-only as perl is), and I'm sick of how every time a new
   tcl/tk release comes out I have to want 6 months for people to "port" their 
   tcl apps to the new version (tkdesk for example). That just doesn't seem
   right. Languages I think would work would be scheme, python, or java. They
   all are multithreaded and I know that python and scheme work nicely
   embedded in C programs. I assume java does too. I would prefer scheme or
   python myself. 

I think a cool way to do it would be to run the interpreter as a module,
requiring a much richer fvwm/module interface probably, and then have it
manage the the various modules people have written in that language. So it
would be completely feasable to support multiple language environments
simultaneously, as well as C modules which use this richer interface to do
cool things like draw menus and 3d titlebars and stuff.

How would that be different from X11::Fvwm for Perl and the fvwmpython and
fvwmperl modules in 'extras' with 2.0.46?  Same basic thing?

Yes, that seems a good way to do it.

Another idea would be a more radical look at what window managers do.
i.e., write an extension to Tcl to allow Tcl programs to do the things
that window managers need to do.  So it would allow me to catch events
when windows were about to appear (to let me reparent them), to
reparent them (which Tk can already do), to warp the cursor, and so
on.  I'd guess that would allow some things to be done in independent
processes, which might be fun.  This is not particularly related to
fvwm, however.

I want to use TCL as the configuration language of fvwm instead of the
current command set=2E The reason for using TCL and not perl, slang or
any other configuration language, was to make the new TCL-based
configuration files completely backward compatible with the current
configuration files=2E

*IF* TCL was used as the configuration language, then some modules

Ah.  Clever.  Just looking at my .fvwm2rc suggests it's not entirely
Tcl-friendly, but it's very close.  Specifically, the function
definitions have + as the first word, so you'd need to keep track of
what the last definition was or something.  And the module definition
lines are weird: you'd presumably have to use something nasty like
redefining unknown.

I don't want to write major pieces of TCL here=2E I just want a better
fvwm configuration language with all the modern programming constructs
(if, while, for, procedures, etc) and some easier concepts for the
more obscure features of the current configuration languages,
especially the functions (this is not a flame on the origial
developer, as I believe the idear is alright for small functions, but
very difficult for larger functions=2E)=2E

Also I miss maving acces to the current state of fvwm from the
configuration file itself=2E That would be easy to add within a TCL
framework=2E

And yes I do know that many believe the TCL programming paradigm to be
ugly, but given the goal of being backward compatible with the current
configuration files, I see no other usable languages=2E Of cause we
could invent one ourselves, but that is exactly what I want to
prevent=2E=2E=2E

These are undoubtably better languages than TCL, at least from a
"pure" language design point-of-view, but, then the current
configuration files will not be compatible with the new ones=2E

Maybe it is just me that want the configuration files to be backward
compatible=2E=2E=2E If that is not an issue, then I would use perl=2E My ma=
in
reasons for this is the large base of modules for perl and especially
perl/tk that would enable lots of new possiblities=2E=2E=2E An perl is
multi-threaded!!!

True!

Of cause, we would want to add a new more TCL friendly module
definition, which shouldn't be too hard=2E=2E=2E When everybody has
converted to the new configuration language (2-3 years), the

 Heavily programmable window managers have been done before, without
huge amounts of success. If one wants to try again, I strongly suggest
using a language that's as good and as clean as possible (not TCL;
perhaps Python).

 In the context of fvwm, I suggest using the language as an extension
mechanism instead of the core of the window manager. Look at things that
just can't be done in fvwm right now and see if you can make it possible
to program them in the extension language. I doubt that many people want
to complicate their configuration files by having to write them in a
language.

 I would also suggest that one start by writing a module wrapper such
that one can write fvwm modules in the language. That would be a useful
way to add various pieces of functionality and to let you experiment
with what sorts of language bindings were needed to allow for useful
features. Bonus points for making the result use as little memory
as possible, given that one selling point of fvwm over other window
managers is memory usage.

I appreciate Fvwm's small memory consumption and speed. My computer is
an old 486 DX66. I prefer not to bring up an interpreter to do common
tasks. I hope Fvwm does not get bloated.

Is there any consideration of java as the language for the fvwm? Our =
company would make great use of such a feature.

The entire industry seems to be waiting for something like this. I could =
see a Java based Windows Manager quickly becoming the de facto standard.

Many people, including myself, will refuse to have anything to do with
perl. It's not wise to pick a language on so many people's blacklists. Guile,
while probably tecnically the most feasable, should probably be set aside for
the same reason.

I'd like to make the point that java is not the only platform independant
language out there. Python and tcl in particular have strong constituencies. 

Also, as far as I know the discussion so far is about various degress of an
extension language, not rewriting fvwm entirely in a new language. And even if 
we did, I don't know if we would want to use awt (or tk) for the graphical
components of fvwm (and I don't know, but kinda doubt, that awt allows for the 
gory X stuff a window manager needs, like reparenting windows).

I agree. That's why I made the point (and will make again) that we should have 
at most one interpreter running. I negelected to say that fvwm should work
perfectly nicely without having an interpreter built in as well. That's also a 
prerequisite I would want satisfied.

Do you mean that you don't visit web sites with server side CGI (most
estimates put Perl at 75-80% of CGI)?  I doubt it.  You seem to mean
that you have religious intolerance against using perl yourself.  From
what I understand, the main blacklist Perl is on is that of the
Computer Science establishment.  If that's your perspective, why not
say so.

Perl's not perfect, and I wouldn't use it for some things because it's
just unsuitable.  But an FVWM2 configuration is a small database of
sorts, and perl handles those quite nicely.

But FVWM already *has* an interpreter running!  You can pull up the
FvwmTalk module any old time you want, issue commands.  No, it doesn't
do conditionals and looping (which CS tells us is sufficient for most
reasonable things to be done in reasonable time), but it *is* and
interpreter and it *is* running all the time.

So I think we agree that the extension language might very well reside
in a module rather than in the "core" code.  Hmmm... what visibility
to the "core" data structures can/should a module have?  Given a
module extansion language implementation, there's an awful lot of data
to have to pass around ...
