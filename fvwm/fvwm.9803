G'day fvwm'ers!

I'm having a problem with fvwm2.0.46 and 2.0.46 under Digital Unix 4.0. 
When I do a View Source or View Page Info with Netscape Navigator 4.04,
the windows pop up without decorations (ie. NoTitle and NoBorder).

The other Netscape windows (print, preferences, edit bookmarks, etc) are
all decorating correctly. I'm using a global Style definition 'Syle "*"
UseStyle Win95' in my .fvwm2rc which works fine for every other window!

FvwmIdent tells me this for the "Main Navigator Window" a "View Page
Source"  window and a "View Page Info" window (some things shortened and
left out for brevity) -

		Main Window	Page Source		Page Info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:		Netscape: ...	Netscape: Source of:    Netscape: Document..
Icon Name:	Netscape	Netscape		Netscape
Class:		Netscape	Netscape		Netscape
Resouce:	Navigator	Dialog			Dialog
BoundaryWidth:	5		0			0
Sticky:		No		No			No
OnTop:		No		No			No
NoTitle:	No		Yes			Yes
Iconified:	No		No			No

Any ideas? Is the "Resource: Dialog" important? Is there some X or
Netscape setting (maybe in Netscape.ad) that could be telling Navigator to
create this windows without titles and handles? Or is it purely a FVWM
problem?

BTW - fvwm95 with Navigator 4.04 works fine (all windows decorating
correctly).

You might want to look for a Style called "DecorateTransient" ... Check it
out in the man page. Basically, this tells FVWM that it _SHOULD_ decorate
transient application windows (windows that are derived from the main
application). You might have the style "NakedTransient" defined
(DecorateTransient's couterpart) somewhere. Just make sure that this
doesn't appear anywhere:

Style "*" NakedTransient

and make sure that this DOES:

Style "*" DecorateTransient

It probably decorates transients automatically (or it's in your fvwm95rc
and you don't even know it ;). 

It works fine for me in fvwm2.0.45

I read somewhere how to automatically jump focus to a window that an app pops

I'm trying to mimic Motif's "Occupy Workspace" submenus in fvwm-2.0.46.

I'm getting an aproximation of their look (not yet of their
functionality) using FvwmScript, but I'm not all that confortable 
with it.

Have you got any suggestion on alternative ways to obtain this result?

Hello

Perhaps this falls under the 'Need to fix to work correctly under 24bit
(TrueColor) displays' in TODO, but whenever I run Netscape on a Ultra30
+ Creator 3d on fvwm2 .0.46 I see all the graphics, but no or little of
text.  Usually I just get horizontal blue lines where the text should
be; sometimes I see something (like stuff in <pre></pre> or
<strong></strong>).

Or perhaps the problem is with Netrape, but it works under CDE.  And I
refuse to submit more bug reports to Netscape, since ever since I did
that they keep sending me some htmlized crap by email.

Any fvwm-related clues for me?

Thanks Ken, but this is already set. My default style is this - 

Style Win95     UseDecor Win95, Color #c0c0c0/#c0c0c0, \
        Button 1, Button 2, Button 4, Button 6, \
        BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, Handles, \
        MWMFunctions, HintOverride, MWMBorder, MWMDecor, MWMButtons, \
        DecorateTransient, NoPPosition, SloppyFocus, \
        RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement, \
        NoIcon, MiniIcon mini-x2.xpm

I tried adding an explicit 'Style "*"   DecorateTransient' and it didn't
make any difference. Any other ideas?

This sounds more like the X-font bug included in Solaris2.6,
which Netscape happily triggers. Try changing your font in
Netscape into one of the linotypes (type 1 fonts are the problem).

Sooner or later Sun might post a patch for this, in the meantime
I'm quite happy using palatino as main font in Netscape.

That's one option; another option is to try the workaround explained below,
posted on comp.sys.sun.admin.  (There are 2 messages explaining different
ways of implementing the same workaround.)  Caveat: I haven't tried this
myself (yet).

Title bars  and borders are  controlled by fvwm2 not  the application.
The application can  give hints about what is  wants,  but the borders
and titlebars   are created by fvwm2.    You  also want  to  check for
"NoTitle" and "HandleWidth 0" or "BorderWidth 0".

Try adding this to the end of your .fvwm2rc:

Style "*" DecorateTransients, Title, HandleWidth 8, BorderWidth 8

I found that when running on Digital Alpha certain windows weren't being
given borders even when specified explicitly in the .fvwm file. I
recently switched to running on Sun Ultra Sparc and the problem has,
curiously enough, now disapeared. Looks like theres something strange
happening here...

Check out TkDesk.  It manages icons on the desktop that you double click to
activate the associated application (or any editor if it is a file.).  It is
very configurable.  Check out:

Which indeed it is, and all for the better because it made me finally
install the iso8859-2 fonts on the machine and make them the default.

Maybe, then maybe not.  It works like a charm now, thanks to Jakob
Thorell, Mattias Borell and Michael Hucka for suggestions that helped me
right away.

Thank you,

I am also trying to figure this out (for Linux) without much luck.
First of all, I'm using M4 processing, and have a bunch of files:
~/.fvwm2rc.xxxxxx  (modules,defstyles, init, etc).  I've tried
adding the
Style "*" DecorateTransient, Title, HandleWidth 8, BorderWidth 8
to the .fvwm2rc.defstyles file.  It has been difficult for me to
figure out which file I should be editing......
I then check the resulting composite file that ends up as 
/tmp/fvwm2rcxxxxxxxx.  The DecorateTransient line is in there,
and I don't see any conflicting styles.  However, when I 'Restart'
fvwm I still get the same behaviour.  I'm primarily looking at the
Netscape 'Find' popup.

Any other thoughts?  Also, Andrew, how did you get the list of
Style defaults you gave below?  Or is this in one of your
initialization files (which one)?  

thanks,
bob

	Well, may be you don't remember me, but I was the one who
made the patch and posted it to the list, the reason for this mail
is that I lost the original code while changing my HD, so could anybody
send it back to me again?, thanks in advance.

PS: Don't post it to the list, resend it to me, and to avoid getting
my mailbox saturated, only send it before Wednesday (GMT).

'DecorateTransients' should be 'DecorateTransient', but anyhow, when I
added this every window on the desktop, including pager and tkgoodstuff
changed styles... but the Navigator 4.04 Source/Info windows remain
stubbornly unadorned! 

BTW - Netscape 3.01 source and info windows DO GET styled properly. 

I'm beginning to think it's a problems with Netscape Navigator 4.04 under
Digital Unix (there are other DNS problems with this version also).

Hmmm, I've got a couple of Digital Unix boxes here. I'll grab netscape
and try it this evening. In the meantime can you send ALL the
Style lines from your config? That might allow us to spot if there's
anything wrong.

 I have written a simple preliminary patch to add this feature to fvwm2
(2.0.46). When manually placing a window, you can click Button3 and the
window will be placed where it is and either extended down to the bottom
of the screen or truncated at the bottom of the screen (if its bottom
is off the bottom of the screen). I don't know enough about how fvwm2
keyboard shortcuts are implemented to know if they can be used for this,
or if you'd have to use a real mouse button.

 The patch works, except for a small glitch that I don't understand: if
you bang a window up against the left of the screen, move your mouse
pointer up, and hit Button3 before the rubber band has updated to the
new mouse position (when you bang the rubber band against the left, it
'sticks' perceptibly in that position), most of the time the window is
not extended but instead placed (at the current mouse position) in its
initial size.

 People who are interested in this patch -- especially if you understand
the above glitch and can easily debug it -- can send me email to get a
copy.

Silly question but did you check to make sure that FvwmButtons did in fact
compile, I seem to remember there being something missing in the makefile
and it didn't actually link.  So you may want to start there.

I'm trying to learn how to configure the .m4 files in the AnotherLevel

Well, the documentation for GNU m4 comes with it, and if you have RH5 it
was installed for you.

All GNU docs are in _info_ format.  The simplest way to read them is via
GNU Emacs (choose Help->Browse Manuals) but there is also a standalone
program "info" you can run.

Hello..

I remember reading something about windows rolling up into just their
title bars when minimized, but I can't find it now.  Can fvwm do this? 
How?

I believe you are looking for IconBox .. I'm using something 
[correctly || incorrectly ] like this:

Style "*"          DecorateTransient,IconBox 920 90 980 440,SloppyFocus

To place icons in a region defined by the four numbers. Read the
FvwmIconBox (1) man page for more details.

I think you mean windowshading.  In my .fvwm2rc, I have:

AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "M" Move
+                         "M" Raise
+                         "C" Raise
+                         "D" Windowshade

and the last line means that double-clicking the title bar make the
rest of the window disappear or re-appear.  I also added

+                       "&Windowshade"    Windowshade

into the AddToMenu "Window-Ops2" section.

Hope this helps.  I use it all the time, and don't minimize windows
any more.

Hello there!

I have some trouble binding keys on my SGI Indy.  Could you help me?  The
silly thing is that some bindings do work, and some others don't:

This works:
	
	Key KP_Divide	A	A	Move
	Key F1		A	A	Maximize 0 80

But this doesn't:

	Key F1		A	C	Maximize 0 80

2.0.44
       8. Hopefully fixed long standing startup timing bug in which
          some windows didn't get Style attributes or borders (by
          fixing when server was grabbed and making sure it didn't get
          ungrabbed to early accidentally)


Unfortunately, this still seems to be a problem in 2.0.46.  :-(

short:	create a button, which, when single clicked calls a function,
	which does trigger the action, if there's (another!) single click.


long:

this is what I use:

*FvwmButtons (	Icon xterm.xpm,	\
		Action XTerm, \
		Action (Mouse 1) 'Xec "Menu Tools" "Popup Machines OnHostExec $0 $1 xterm"', \
		Action (Mouse 2) 'Xec "Menu WindowOps" "X xlock"', \
		Action (Mouse 3) 'Xec  MyWindowList	"X @@"')


the Xec function executes the second arg, if there was a click (after the
click in FvwmButtons, from which it was called, i.e: a double-click)
otherwise it executes the first argument (motion or simple after the
motion-timeout i.e: single-click -> motion-timeout) 
FYI: "I" didn't work for single-click.


DestroyFunc Xec
AddToFunc Xec		"M"	$0
+			"C"	$1

DestroyFunc X
AddToFunc X		"I"	Exec exec $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9


It's actually some sort of 'undocumented feature',
I've been posting this to the list several times ago.
I don't like it, but it does work for me, and I didn't have time to get
involved with FvwmButtons, too.

This undocumented feature exploits the Motion-timeout-bug (even if you don't
move the cursor, it's a motion), so if this one is fixed, my menus won't
work any more. But this bug has been around for years now.
It's almost symptomous for fvwm2. If this bug were fixed, I'd say 'The
fvwm2-code-cleanup has at last gotten to a final phase'.

cheers,

Hi,

could someone tell me how to get a desktop picture working?  I have an
8-bit .xpm image that I put in $HOME/.fvwm2/background.xpm.  But when
I run the script setup-background, it says
  Couldn't allocate required colors
and does nothing.  If I make the image black-and-white it works fine.
Is this the stupid X 256-entry colormap limitation rearing its head again?  
(Earth to X: memory is much cheaper these days.)  How many colors am
I allowed to have, and how do I truncate it down to that number if the
only imaging tool I have is xv?

thanks,

Earth here again: It's not memory .. simms speaking, but video card .. If
you have a card that can support it, run with 16 bpp or 24bpp .. Check
your X configuration .. Verify your video card and make the necessary
changes, if applicable, to acquire more colors and color depth.

256 colors is a thing of the past, in my opinion. Speaking of cheap, video
cards aren't highly priced anymore, either. A two meg video card is
roughly 20 to 40 dollars, eh? It can give you 16bpp if your current card
cannot. 

(btw, you might also be running a limited server, ie the 256 color version
instead of SVGA or an accelerated server.)

furthermore, this is kind of off the fvwm-subject.

The 256 colors isn't an X limit, it because of your video card.  Run you card
in 16 bit or 24 bit color, or buy a card that can.  My 4MB VRAM card was only
$75 several months ago, and I run it at 1200x900 24bit.

If you want to get the # of colors down in your image, try getting netpbm or
the gimp.  I don't think you can do it with xv.  You could load netscape, then
load xv and have it dither to the common colormap.  Then start another xv and
grab the window..

Hello..

Anyone know of good places to get xpm files to put in window borders?  I
just discovered this ability of Fvwm, and I love it!  (but I don't have
any good textures to use...)

Hi,

At my school, we have a messaging system called "zephyr" where students 
online can send messages to each other, and these messages pop up on your
screen as "windowgrams" in their own separate window.  The problem that I
have is that I have fvwm configured to click-to-focus (I *hate* focus-
follows-mouse and don't want to use that unless it is a last resort), and
whenever I receive one of these windowgrams, the focus is automatically
placed on the new window, and it becomes a pain when I am trying to type
in a different window.

So, my question is, is there something in the configuration files that will
allow me to use click-to-focus while at the same time not focusing on newly
created windows?  If not, is there something that can easily be done in the
code to allow for this?

Please respond directly to this account, as I am not on the official mailing
list.

Thanks

Hi to all!
I am using fvwm 2.0.45, recompiled from source on a Linux RedHat system.
I'd like to obtain this: when moving iconized windows, I'd want them to
move
of a discreet quantity, like if they were on a grid (moving on "snap"),
so that
the icons are always aligned.
This is possible, for example, on CDE.
Do you know how can I obtain this? (I think I'll have to modify sources,
but I
don't mind).

thanks a lot

If  you attempt   this, start  with  fvwm  2.0.46.  I think  the Linux
version of 2.0.46 already  includes  the "iconboxes patch" which   you
will need in order to have an icongrid.

If not, you will find  this patch in the  "unofficial patches" area of
the fvwm2 home page.

Hello..

Is there a way to associate different border/handle widths with
different decors?  (or at least a command to change the borderwidth of
an existing window)  I'm trying to create a "change decor" menu, to
change the appearance of existing windows..

Fvwm gives me something new to be amazed at every day...  :)

Is there a way to change the border colors of inactive windows?  .. 
Something similar to "hilightcolor", but for inactive windows.  I can't
find anything about it in the man page or in the examples I've found.

I think you're looking for:

Style "*" Color fore/back

it's in the man page, just not spelled out very well.

I have noticed an annoying problem with fvwm2 (both 2.0.45 and 2.0.46).

I have my DeskTopSize set to "1 6" (1 wide by 6 high).

My EdgeResistance is set to 750 50.

To see this problem, position a window (an xterm works good) so that the
bottom border of the window is right at the bottom edge of one of the
virtual screens:

| |
| |  xterm
| |
| |____________
+============== <-- bottom of virtual screen, border of xterm is actually
                    touching it; there should be no "root window" pixels
                    visible

Now, take the mouse and quickly slide it to the bottom border of the
xterm and click the left button. Since the mouse is in the window's
border region, it SHOULD perform the Mouse 1 action associated with
the window side (in my case, Raise-or-Resize). Unfortunately, what it
does is perform the action associated with clicking in the root window
(in my case, popping up a "Root Menu").

I've looked at the code in virtual.c, and it appears that fvwm creates
four windows around the edge of the screen that it uses strictly for
"input notification" to tell when the mouse has entered one of these
four "invisible" windows around the edge of the screen (they are 2
pixels wide). I think somehow these windows are interfering with the
desired action, but that is just a guess.

This is important to me because I use this technique to quickly "Raise"
a window by sliding the mouse down to its bottom border (a "hard stop",
so it doesn't require precise mouse positioning) and clicking the left
button... unfortunately, I get the stupid "Root Menu" instead of the
desired "Raise-or-Resize" action!

Any suggestions on how to fix this? I tried a couple quick hacks in
virtual.c and events.c, but to no avail.

Thanks for any suggestions,
Eddy

P.S. For some reason, this problem does *NOT* exhibit itself when fvwm2
     is first started -- it isn't until you actually MOVE to different
     virtual screen that this behavior manifests itself. If you stay on
     the first virtual screen, the actions described above work
     "as expected".

I downloaded 2.0.46 and the iconboxes patch and recompiled.
It works, but it doesn't do whta I needed: when I move the icons, I can
still
drop them anywhere on the screen, at random positions...
What I expected was that after defining something like

Style "*" IconBox +900+8+927+800, IconGrid 90 90

I would have had the icons dropped at least at 90 pixel from each
other... :(
If I am doing something wrong, can you point it out? (and then tell me?)

No, you are doing nothing wrong.  You still have to make changes, as I
said, "start  with fvwm 2.0.46.".   Before 2.0.46 and the patch, there
was a built in 3x3  pixel grid, but no  way to  change the grid  size.
This would have been useless for your purposes.

The iconbox and the icongrid affect AUTOMATIC placement of icons only.
Once you move an icon, the icon stays wherever  you move it.  In fact,
you will  see a switch being  set in the  window  structure saying the
icon was moved, which  currently forces fvwm2  to leave the icon where
it was moved to.  This also affects how the icon is positioned when it
is marked "sticky" and you change desktops.

I'm not sure why  you are moving icons, but  my guess is that you want
to  change the move logic,  so that if an  icon is dropped anywhere in
the iconbox you  want to see if  its near an  open  grid location, and
drop it into that spot, and not mark it "moved".

You  may notice that  the actual placement  in the grid could use some
fine tuning.  With fvwm,  icons can be  any size and the current logic
doesn't center the icon  into the grid.   It currently places the icon
into the upper left, (it really depends on the "iconfill direction").

Hello,


Sometime in the late 1900s it was said:

   I am not too sure (I possibly could be wrong here), but I
   think what he is trying to get the icons to do is:

      .  after minimizing a window the icon should end up
         in the IconBox area defined above.
      .  if this icon is ever moved out of that region
         by the dragging it w/the mouse, it (the icon)
         should be return to the IconBox area; like a
         "sling-shot" effect.

   now if I am wrong in interpreting the person's request
   I still think this *might* be a nice feature to be added
   to fvwm2 in some future release.  Or maybe not  :-)

   Comments?

You're right here.

>          by the dragging it w/the mouse, it (the icon)

No...
Let me do an example.
Let's say I defined an icon grid of 30x30 pixels. This grid should cover
the entire desktop space. 
	----------------------------------------------
	| <- 30 pix ->  | <- 30 pix ->  | <- 30 pix ->  | etc.
	| ^		|		|		|
	| |		|		|		|
	| 30		|		|		|
	| pixels	|		|		|
	| |		|		|		|
	-------------------------------------------------

Ok?
Now: I have an icon in the icon box, and I want to move it somewhere
else
on the desktop. If I decide to drop it (let's use the upper left corner)
in +30+30, it should be dropped.
If I decide to drop it in +40+40, the icon should be dropped with the
upper left corner 
in +30+30, while trying to drop it, for example, in +55+35, would drop
it
effectively in +60+30...

...hope it helped to understand...

thanks for the effort :))

greetings

If you have used a windows or mac computer, they have an "arrange icons"
function will take all the icons and place them in a nice little grid.  This
is easier because these systems only allow icons on one size.  I think what
Guido wants is something like this that happens every time an icon is moved,
and where the icons are moved as little as possible to snap to the grid.

It seems like this should be easy.  Just find the code that gets run when an
icons is dropped and have it find the correct icon-grid position and move the
icon there.

Try to comment out the following line in the file 'misc.c' under
the directory 'fvwm-2.0.46/fvwm'

void RaiseWindow(FvwmWindow *t)
{
....

  /* raisePanFrames(); */
}

and recompile fvwm2. I guess here is the only place raisePanFrames
is called. Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, this did NOT have any affect, from what I could tell.
The one thing that did have an effect was changing the
PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS in fvwm.h from 2 to 0 and recompiling.

Of course, a thickness of zero on the pan frames means you cannot use
the mouse to change virtual screens; you must rely on FvwmPager or
key bindings.

I would like to see a solution that allows both; I can see no reason
where clicking on the border of a window should not perform the action
associated with clicking on the border. Why a window-border click is
being treated as a root-window click makes no sense to me and seems
very broken.

I made patches to drag a window/icon into FvwmPager to move the
window/icon.

The patches are in 2 files, fvwm-dragin.patch and pager-dragin.patch.=20
You need both of them. Apply the patches from your fvwm2 top
directory. These patches are against fvwm2.0.46 distribution. Then,
compile fvwm base code and FvwmPager by invoking 'xmkmf; make' in each
directory. Install the code with 'make install'.

You can add a configuration line in your .fvwm2rc to choose pager
behavior.

   *FvwmPagerDragIn [True|False]

The default is true. If this is set to false, drag-in will not occur,
although you can still use pager move by doing as below.

You can define mouse 2 on title bar to do pager move.

    Mouse 2 T A SendToModule FvwmPager WindowId $w EnterWindow



You should have received a more explanation if you subscribe
fvwm-workers mailing list.  The patch files are also available at:=20

I can't get the ClickToFocus style to work in Fvwm2 (2.0.46)

Is this really a working feature, or just a cruel joke?

I also can't get the ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick global option
to work, some how I think these two are related.

One other thing, most of my modules don't work. I've got the
module path set correctly but only a few of the modules work,
and none of them load at startup (I can invoke FvwmPager from
the command line, but it won't show up during startup, even
though it's in my startup and restart functions)

I've seen modules working on other installations, and I think
I modules worked for a short time on my installation, until I
compiled and installed 2.0.46.

My configuration is:

Linux 2.0.33 running Xkernel 2.0 (X11R5 server) on a Sun3/60
with a cgfour frame buffer (8-bit color).

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I have noticed a bug in the version of fvwm I am currently experimenting
with.  When trying to restart fvwm from a menu, it often doesn't work
properly.

It seems that the menu doesn't get unposted properly, and when fvwm comes
back it doesn't know what to do with it.  Essentially, when I restart, all
of my windows get undecorated; then they are redocorated.  The popup menu is
decorated as a normal window at this time, although I believe it is now just
a blank, untitled window.

The mouse pointer stays as the arrow that comes up when a menu is brought
up; fvwm appears 'stuck' on this menu; I can't change desktops or monitors,
can't focus windows or bring up menus, etc.

I believe this has something to do with the movement of the mouse in the
menu; I think that if I am careful not to move the mouse when I select
restart, I can avoid this.  But it appears that if I move the mouse at the
wrong time, fvwm won't completely notice the button release, and although it
will restart, it won't unpost the menu.  

Once, I was able to move a window by clicking on the titlebar, and moving
the mouse while releasing the button; I was then able to drag the window
around without having to keep the button pressed.  I haven't been able to
repeat that, however.

I would appreciate any help on this; I haven't really been able to debug it
at all, though; since my system becomes pretty much useless once this
happens until I can log in remotely to kill fvwm.

I am running fvwm 2.0.46 under solaris 2.6 with the standard Sun openwin
X11, based on X11R6.

It was compiled with Sun cc: 

cc -V
cc: WorkShop Compilers 4.2 30 Oct 1996 C 4.2
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

Here are the scripts from the rpm, to show how it was built..

%prep
%setup -n fvwm-%version
%patch0

%build
xmkmf -a
make DESTDIR=%prefix/ BINDIR=bin XAPPLOADDIR=lib/app-defaults USRLIBDIR=%prefix/

mkdirhier $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%prefix/include/X11/pixmaps
cd icons
cp * $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%prefix/include/X11/pixmaps


The patch is just a minor change to the imake template, to move some of the
paths, etc.  I don't think it would affect anything, but here it is if
anyone is interested:

AddToFunc GoodRestart

AddToMenu MainMenu "Main Menu" Title

Where erica is a shell script that has x-permissions set for you and does the following:

1) kill fvwm
2) start fvwm

Hope this helps.

Is there any way under fvwm2 to make all transient windows automatically get
focus when they appear?  It would be much more convienient than having to
move the mouse to that window.

                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an excellent idea.  It would solve both our problems.  Perhaps
this could be added to the suggestion to the fvwm maintainers?

Hi,
I have installed a pre-compiled version of Fvwm2 on a RS/6000 43P =
running AIX 4.1.5. I have noticed that the FvwmButtons Module does not =
work. I believe there may be others that are not working but this one is =
important to me. I have had Fvwm2 running on UE 3000 running Solaris =
2.5.1 and have had everything working. It may be possible that in the =
pre-compile that buttons was not included, but who would intentionally =
do this? Could there be another reason that Buttons is not working? Any =
help in this would be greatly appreciated.



Thanks

How can we help if all you say is "the FvwmButtons Module does not work"?
Is there anything on your console?
Look at your ModulePath in your .fvwm2rc.

Hi,

I have a problem with FvwmIconBox in Sun Solaris 2.6:
I've compiled fvwm-2.0.46 with GNU gcc, and FvwmIconBox
doesn't work: it only shows an empty window (no icons in it).

I've tried with my .fvwm3rc, sample.fvwm2rc, ...

What's the problem? (with fvwm 1.xx, it works OK).


Thanks in advance.

This is  a pretty common question, its  easy to overlook.  It may seem
counterintuitive, but  icons will only  go into FvwmIconBox  when they
are associated with "styles" that have the "NoIcon" attribute.

Something like:

Style "*" Icon myicon.xpm, NoIcon


It was  years ago,   but once again,    I suggest this  change  to the
"system.fvwmrc" that is distributed with fvwm2:

Around line 192:
OLD:
+			"IconBox"	Module	FvwmIconBox
NEW:
+			"IconBox"	ConfigFvwmIconBox

AddToFunc ConfigIconBox "I" Module FvwmIconBox
+                       "I" Style     "*"  NoIcon
+                       "I" Recapture

(This might help to make FvwmIconBox work out-of-the-box.)
