I have Red Hat Linux 5.2 and an FVWM2, and I cannot display anything but 
pixmaps for a background.  it is extremely annoying and inconvenient.  I had 
a bitmap and a JPEG file, and the preferences screen would not take them.  I 
was wondering where the command line or lines for displaying background 
images is, and if there is a reason I can't display those types of files.  I 
also tried saving them as pixmaps but that didn't seem to work either.  And I 
checked your FAQ and it had no question of this type, so you should be able 
to find it in your infinite wisdom to know the answer.  Just don't ignore me, 
I need a response, even if it is just to tell me I'm a moron.

I believe that with fvwm2 comes xpmroot which can be used to put up
background images on the root window if they are of the type xpm.  
In this case you can say use FvwmBackerDesk to set the root window
background for different desks as follows.

*FvwmBackerDesk 1 Exec xpmroot PATH_TO_TILES/bg.xpm
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 Exec xpmroot ...

If you have a different file format, such as the jpg that you mention then
at least in RH 6.1 they make use of a package called xsri

$ rpm -q xsri
xsri-1.0-4

in order to put up images on the root window for the gdm (replacement for
xdm) login interface.  I think it's a fairly new package, but you should
be able to either get it in an rpm for 5.2, upgrade to 6.1 or 6.2, or
build it yourself.  It has the following options and I know that it
understands jpg, png, ppm, and gif; haven't tried any others...

$ xsri
Usage:
xsri [options] image_file

where options are any of:
  -geometry [WIDTHxHEIGHT][+X+Y]
  -root
  -scale
  -scale-width
  -scale-height
  -avoid [WIDTHxHEIGHT][+X+Y]
  -center-horizontal
  -center-vertical
  -integer-scale
  -keep-aspect

Beyond this there are many other ways, such as using xv. Finally, you
could try to be a little more polite or nicer.  We understand
how frustrating it can be, but no one here is the cause of your problems;
nor are we obligated to offer assistance.

Hi,
    I can't seem to get rid of the bevels that go around the buttons on
window decorations.  I am using
pixmaps for the buttons, and the buttons are rectangular(not square).
Is this what -- flat is supposed
to do?  Any suggestions?  I am using 2.3.25, and here is the releveant
code:

DestroyDecor XMac
AddToDecor XMac
+ BorderStyle  Active (TiledPixmap border_pixel-active.xpm -- flat
HiddenHandles NoInset) Inactive (TiledPixmap border_pixel-inactive.xpm
-- flat HiddenHandles NoInset)
#+ ButtonStyle All (-- flat)
+ TitleStyle     Height 21 Top
     HilightColor   black,\
     WindowFont    -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-8-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
+ TitleStyle ActiveDown (TiledPixmap title-active.xpm -- Flat) \
             ActiveUp (TiledPixmap title-active.xpm -- flat) \
             Inactive (TiledPixmap title-inactive.xpm -- Flat)
+ ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap yellow-active.xpm -- flat) \
        ActiveDown (Pixmap yellow-pressed.xpm -- flat) \
        Inactive (Pixmap yellow-inactive.xpm -- flat)
+ ButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp (Pixmap green-active.xpm -- flat) \
        ActiveDown (Pixmap green-pressed.xpm -- flat) \
        Inactive (Pixmap green-inactive.xpm -- flat)
+ ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp (Pixmap red-active.xpm -- flat) \
        ActiveDown (Pixmap red-pressed.xpm -- flat) \
        Inactive (Pixmap red-inactive.xpm -- flat)
+ ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (Pixmap clear-active.xpm -- flat) \
        ActiveDown (Pixmap clear-pressed.xpm -- flat) \
        Inactive (Pixmap clear-inactive.xpm -- flat)

Any help is appreciated.

Yes.  The order in which you add the individual ButtonStyles may
have an effect if it works or not.  Try the ButtonStyle commands
in sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc-sample-95 as a starting point:

  TitleStyle ActiveUp (solid DarkBlue -- Flat)                                    
  TitleStyle ActiveDown (solid DarkBlue -- Flat)                                  
  TitleStyle Inactive (solid grey51 -- Flat)                                      
  ButtonStyle all -- UseTitleStyle Flat                                           
  AddButtonStyle 2 Pixmap mini.winXX-close.xpm                                    
  ...

Hello List,

I am new to this list and therefore I'd like to introduce myself with a
first personal matter to this list:
I'd like to know of there is a configuration file, which resembles the
IRIX 4dwm look on the fvwm2 window manager..

In fact is there a possibility to make fvwm look more like the default
scwm scheme, which is quite close to the 4dwm look...
To be honest scwm is kinda a difficult to configure at the
beginning...... ;)

I have only found a theme for enlightenment, but it is not configurable,
as it came in one file .... (I am professional enough at enlightenment I
think ...;))
I'd be glad for any response ......

Bye, 

Martin

Er, it's been a while since I last worked under IRIX; I don't remember
4dwm very well anymore. But from what I recall, it's essentially mwm
with some nice add-on bits, like the Desks Overview (FvwmPager can do
most of what Desks Overview did).

A mwm-like config shouldn't be too hard to find... Was there something
specific you had in mind?

E themes are just tar.gz files, they are only named .etheme to confuse
people.
If you run gnu tar xvzf over them all the files in there will come out.

Yup.  However, your changes to get the answer you want are
better if you mail to the fvwm workers list (fvwm@fvwm.org).
I'll send my reply there too.

No, sorry, I have no idea.

I'm not exactly sure how you specify where you want the component
bar.  If I issue

  netscape -component-bar -geometry +x+y

It always opens at +50+54, regardless of the actual values of
x and y.  The only explanation that comes to my mind is this:
netscape ignores the geometry hint you specify but uses its
own idea of the correct values instead.  Furthermore it sets
the 'user specified position' hint which forces fvwm to place
the window exactly where netscape wants it.  If this hint wasn't
set, fvwm would have placed the window like any other window.
This is very likely a netscape bug.  It's a known fact that
netscape does some unusual things with the 'user specified
position' hint.

Hi.   Dorky as this sounds, I would like to use FVWM2 as a W95 replacement - 
with some buttons mapped to different applications like Netscape - Gimp etc. 
    Could someone (with a well commented dotfile ; )
please send me a link to their dot file - with instructions as to where to 
store it, and the different pixmaps they have installed on their system.   I 
have downloaded some files that I thought would be useful
- the dotfile generator  (dotfile-2_4_1-1_noarch.rpm)
- the dotfile fvwm2 module (dotfile-fvwm2-1_1-1_noarch.rpm)
Also from the FVWM2 homepage (I think :)
I downloaded
- 3d pixmaps (3d_pixmaps_V1_21_tar.gz)
- Normal icons (icons_tar.gz)

If someone is using these icons successfully to have "shortcut icon menus"  
(Cant think of a better way to describe it) like in wharf, could they send 
me (off list if neccessary) a copy of the dotfile and where to put it.


Sorry if that sounds absurd, but I am trying to get my head around the 
different options to make fvwm2 usable for myself and my wife.

2nd Q.

IF someone can also send me the syntax of a "shutdown machine" button on 
their X-win desktop that would be cool.

For example - someone told me I could use 'sudo halt' and map it to a 
button.

Cheers.

J

Hi,

As for the W95 emulation, one possibility is to use the AnotherLevel
Package from RedHat, or if you like I can log in once and choose the
Fvwm95 decors and send you the .fvwm2rc file.  (Can't promise on
documentation though...)

As for shutting down there are a couple of possibilities which have been
suggested in the past.  One is

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
how about just setting ctrl-alt-del to shutdown instead of reboot?

in your /etc/inittab do this:

instead of "ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now"
do "ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -h now"

(RH system, but it should be similar everywhere)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
or

Write a little shell script to run the shutdown command.

Install sudo on your system (see the man page, etc.)

Set up the sudoers config file to allow you, your wife, etc. to run that
script with root permissions.

Add a menu item to your FVWM root menu (or wherever) that invokes "sudo
/my/script/name".

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Or another option yet is to use gdm as your X-login interface instead of
xdm.  This has a halt and reboot option on the interface.  My wife already
rebooted my machine with this interface, got nervous when she saw all the
infomation and, "following directions", next thing she new she was in the
BIOS setup...

Using icons to launch things never made any sense to me.

This approach, using fvwmButtons comes close:

DestroyFunc Launcher
AddToFunc Launcher
+ I DestroyModuleConfig $0Launch.*
+ I *$0Launch.(Icon $1, Action `Exec $2`)
+ I *$0Launch.Pixmap none
+ I Module FvwmButtons $0Launch.
+ I Style $0Launch. HandleWidth 0

Launcher RXVT rxvt.xpm "rxvt -bg black -fg green"

This creates a "Launcher" macro that you call with an aritrary name,
the icon name and the command to execute.

You could add a geometry argument for placement.

I don't know how to get a title on it, "Style Title" didn't seem
to work.

If "sudo halt" works, then this should work too:

Launcher DANGER halt.xpm "sudo halt"

That won't   give  you a  confirm button.   You  might look   at using
FvwmForm, and  create  the   window  iconic.   The first  click  would
de-iconify, the second click could shutdown.

I work on SGI machines, and the E theme for irix ("irex") looks
almost exactly like 4Dwm.  I don't personally use 4Dwm any more
(Fvwm is many orders of magnitude better!), so I'll link you to
the e theme shot rather than logging out and back in to create
my own screenshot.

http://images.themes.org/themes/e/shots/934728366.jpg

The important bits to note are the window borders and menus,
(including the font) which are identical to the real thing.

Hi, 

I have been following this discussion for awhile, and since I am using IRIX at
work without having the ability to use fvwm2 with it (no compiler on the O2
box I'm on) I would like to ask (request?) whether anyone can provide
binaries for fvwm2 (any version, preferably 2.3.14+) for IRIX 6.5.7 ?

Is there any place on the net where I can download them? 

Thanx a bunch!

Oh, and by the way, 4dwm really does suck :)

I have a dual head machine which comes up as single area (2*1280x1024)
pixels large. Smart placement always puts the windows very far from
where I working. I would like smart placement to be able to drop the
window under, or within some distance of my mouse.

I used to be able to turn off smart placement and just click where I
wanted the window to fall. On 2.3.15 smart placement seems to be on no
matter whatever I do.

How do you turn smart placement off? I tried NoSmartPlacement,
DumbPlacement ...

thanks

That's up to your X-server, Fvwm will start up a copy on all heads it
finds, unless you tell it not to.

Here's two more suggestions:

1) If you're on RH6, then you'll (probably) have a package installed called
`usermode'. This provides a program /usr/bin/shutdown (among others). It pops
up a dialogue, prompts for the *user's* password, and shuts the machine down!

So add a menu item somewhere (see AddToMenu in man fvwm2):

	+ "Shut down" Exec /usr/bin/shutdown -h now

and perhaps also

	+ "Reboot" Exec /usr/bin/shutdown -r now

(I'm going to add this feature to my AnotherLevelUp package soon.)

2) Add a user called stop -- then you can shutdown at the login prompt. This
may not be wise in a `hostile' environment -e.g. if your machine has a
permanent internet connection. It definitely works if you have text logins, I
haven't tried it with xdm/gdm, but it ought to work.

In /etc/passwd, add the line (as root, carefully)

	stop:XX:0:0::/sbin:/sbin/shutdown -h now

assuming that shutdown lives in /sbin. Note that this is the real shutdown
command, rather than the gui wrapper for it mentioned above, which is (may be)
in /usr/bin. This new user is an alias for root, so make sure it appears AFTER
the entry for root in the passwd file (otherwise all/most references to the
user root will appear as stop!).

Now set the password for stop, running (still as root):

	passwd stop

and follow instructions. You may find an empty password is permitted by passwd
(after it objects about it being `WAY too short') but does not work when you
try to use it, depending on the `pam' set up for logins. However, you should
be able to get a nice short password (single character?) to work, even though
passwd will object when you set it.

By looking at the code, i figgered out the workaround to the problem of NoIconTitle being ignored.

If OLDecor is set, NoIconTitle is ignored.

I removed OLDecor (which i'm not even sure does anything) and NoIconTitle
took effect.

Doah! Of course that will NOT work with xdm/gdm, as they do not start the
user's `shell' (i.e. `shutdown -h now') when you login! You can tell I prefer
text logins! Sorry about that. It's still a reasonable suggestion if you're a
text login user, and as has been pointed out, gdm has a halt option anyway.

J. Q. Newbie here, I've been searching the archives of this list, but to no
avail.  I'm hoping someone out there has had this happen before, and knows a
fix.

I have a crazy penchant for remapping my keyboard to put control in the proper
place, as well as to provide Super/Hyper keys for xemacs and fvwm2 key shortcuts
(the relevant portions of my .xmodmaprc and .fvwm2rc are listed below). 
Everything is working fine, I'm switching between desktops using vi directional
commands, Xterms are starting up with a quick S-x, etc, but when I launch
Netscape (version below), and go to a page which executes any sort of
javascript, Netscape grabs control of my Meta key.  I can no longer switch
between windows with M-Tab, and my Super and Hyper keys no longer work.  I've
tried exiting Netscape, running .xmodmaprc from the command line, and restarting
fvwm2, but nothing works except to completely log out of my X session. 

Has anyone ever seen this before?  Is there a work around?  

Thanks in advance, 
Mike Smith

I know I may have had these answered before (in a roundabout way)
but if someone could answer them, I'd be grateful:

1) How do I find the .fvwm95rc file if there is not one in my /root
($HOME) as root?  I know it must be around somewhere....

2) How do I map a button to a command, and whack it in the"Programs" 
sub-menu (Start-->Programs)

3) how do I get Wharf to persistently start up, just like "config" desktop 
does in Redhat?

4) how do I get "Alt + Tab" (once I find .fvwm95rc file..!) to raise the 
next window to the front (like W95 does?) Currently it brings focus to the 
window (ie changes the title bar to blue) but doesn't bring it to the front, 
so I can't see the whole window behind the current one.

Thanks for all your help. - as far as the last question goes..
I fixed up the "halt" command for the users like I wanted to.. I took the 
easy way out for now, and mapped CTRL+ALT+DEL to halt (shutdown -h now) 
instead of reboot (reboot -r now) in /ect/innittab (thanks someone who 
suggested that!)
Cheers

Firstly which fvwm version are you running? There are slight differences
between them.

Second, fvwm95 is really old and no longer supported. The later versions
of fvwm use .fvwm2rc files for configuration. (BTW: running your X
server as root is a security risk! Don't do it! Start X as a user
instead.)

Menus and buttons are different.

AddToMenu Programs
+ "AppName"	Exec AppName

should work for most applications invoked from a menu.
For a button I'd recommend the "man FvwmButtons" command to read the
manual page for that module. Here's an example line from my config....

*FvwmButtons(1x1, Icon mini-isp.xpm, Action 'Exec kppp', Back grey55)

That line invokes kppp to dial-up my connection.

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmWharf

Refer the man page for fvwm2 (man fvwm2).

I use a function like...

DestroyFunc FocusAndWarp
AddToFunc FocusAndWarp I Focus
+                      I WarpToWindow 50 50

But that could also be....
DestroyFunc FocusAndRaise
AddToFunc FocusAndRaise I Focus
+                       I Raise

Then a couple of lines like...
Key Tab         A       M       Prev FocusAndWarp
Key Tab         A       MS      Next FocusAndWarp 
should do it.

There's some sample .fvwm2rc's in recent versions of fvwm source in the
sample.fvwmrc/ directory, including a working Win95 clone rc-file.

Some "online" help for fvwm configs is available via Internet Relay
Chat, on EFNET servers, and channel #fvwm (linux help on #linuxhelp) 
I'm usually lurking thereabouts along with a few other fvwm users. :)

Jake, 
	I gather you're using RH__ which means that you are using their
AnotherLevel (AL) package...  So, depending on what you want to do I might
have a few answers for you.

If it is AL and RH then the default startup scripts tell FvwmM4 to put a
copy of the .fvwm2rc file in your /tmp directory.  To figure out which is
which look at the user. (it also erases them the next time you log in...)

>2) How do I map a button to a command, and whack it in the"Programs" 
>sub-menu (Start-->Programs)

If you want to run some executeable like say xv there is a simple way to
do it without hacking on the .fvwm2rc file.  Use wmconfig, or more
correctly stated use it better.  The menus are automatically generated by
a program called wmconfig and if you look at the directory 

/etc/X11/wmconfig/

you will find a bunch of files.  The man page describes the format.  For
mere users you can add to that set by creating a directory called
.wmconfig in your home directory and put a similar set of files in there.
This is what I typically do if I add a package which I'm the only person
likely to use it...

I should mention that it seems to me that the behaviour of this program
(wmconfig) is a little buggy since RH6.1 'cause it appears to be looking
in other directories as well such as the sub directories
of /etc/X11/applnk/ .  This is where all of the gnome stuff is kept.  Of
course none of this is mentioned in the man page...

>3) how do I get Wharf to persistently start up, just like "config" desktop 
>does in Redhat?

I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.  If you mean that you want the bar
on the right hand side of the screen which is FvwmWharf and acts like
Afterstep's thing then it's simple.  One way is to copy the file

/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.init.m4

to your home directory and call it 
.fvwm2rc.init
Then edit this file adding this line to launch FvwmWharf to the
SetupFunction

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Module  FvwmWharf
...

all done... Choose restart and it should be there...

I can't remember the command for raising the next window, but it's just a
key binding and you should find a description of something like it in the
man page.  Again, if you want to continue to use the AL package all you
would need to do to keep things cleanly separated is to copy the file 

/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.keys.m4

to your home directory and call it .fvwm2rc.keys

and then insert the key maping in this file.  This is the sort of stuff I
did for my wife so that she could have things personalized...

J - I'll find out what version I am running, but how do I do that?
(Help - About?)  How do I UN-install the old version of fvwm2 and re-install 
the new?  (I assume that you just delete the directory and gunzip the new 
package into the same directory)

J - I still don't know the version - but I do know that I did have the file 
.fvwm95rc once, so I guess the version Im running must be old.

Thanks for the security tip re 'root user', but How do I startx as a user, 
and then open an xwin session as another user?

J - I assume this command goes in my .fvwm2rc file when I find it/ install 
new version so I can find it.

J - Thanks heaps for that. I'll keep this email as a reference so when I get

J - thanks once again matey.  I'll keep that in mind, though I am in nz at

It's not really interesting to know the release since fvwm95 is
a different window manager that hasn't been developed by people
on this list and has not been maintained for years now.  The
recent stable fvwm2 releases or beta releases provide virtually
all functionality that fvwm95 did, but with some minor and major
differences in syntax.  In the latest betas there's an unfinished
config that was copied from fvwm95 in the sample-fvwmrc directory).

Bye

At any prompt issue the command "fvwm2 -version" (without the quotes of
course)
Or "fvwm95 -version" if it's the other binary. If it IS fvwm95 I
strongly urge you to upgrade to at least the last stable version
(fvwm2.2.4)
I'm also guessing your linux distribution is redhat. This too makes a
difference to your fvwm installation. (see other replies)

Unless you have an .rpm version of fvwm uninstalling is problematic.
Most people just install new versions which overwrite the older
binaries, although many distributions of linux place the fvwm2 binary in
/usr/X11R6/bin whilst versions built from source usually install to
/usr/local/bin. Use "which fvwm2" to locate the fvwm2 binary in your
$PATH. Old module dir's can be deleted if no longer required as these
can sometimes account for as much as 6 or 7 Mb of hd space.
The module directory is most commonly
/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/$(version)/

You could use a "session manager" like xdm or gdm(see man xdm), or
simply login via console and issue a "startx fvwm2" command.

Yup! You'll see lots of examples of this in that file once you find it.
Try using "locate fvwm2rc". (or fvwm95rc)

If kde is installed on your system you can take advantage of the
fvwm-menu-directory script in later fvwm versions to invoke the actual
menus and applications kde uses.

New versions of fvwm have sample.fvwm2rc's with this function and many
many more already included.
In fact, if you're prepared to upgrade to a late snapshot of the
development version of fvwm(see www.fvwm.org downloads page), there's a
very new development version of Fvwm Themes available(check the links
page) which does most things that people want or very soon will. Themes
for fvwm are still under construction,
but already is very usable with 10 themes and mix & match components.
Many additional features are planned or undergoing development.
Upgrading to newer versions of the themes package is safe and painless
once downloaded.

I guess we'll have to wait till the Fvwm code will be
compatible with XFree86 4.0's Xinerama extension.

Hi,

This is getting long, so I'm going to trim it down a bit.

If you're using RedHat then I strongly suggest you do not do this.  To
find out what version of fvwm2 you are using type 

$ rpm -q fvwm2
fvwm2-2.2.2-3

(This is from the default RH6.1 install, though I use fvwm2.2.4 ...)

This is the package which the rpm database knows about.  Another thing you
can do is, if I am guessing correctly what version you are using, press
the left mouse button on the root window and select "About Fvwm".  If you
are using the AnotherLevel package then you will see at the top the words
"AnotherLevel - a FVWM2 configuration" and below the version of Fvwm2
among other things.  To upgrage, go to rufus or RedHat or wherever you
like and download a new rpm.  Then as root type

rpm -Uvh fvwm2......rpm

to upgrade the package.  You should be able to find fvwm2.2.4 in rpm
form...  Are you using RH5.2 or 6.x?

Of course if you would prefer to build it yourself you can always do so...

Tom

Is there a second-by-second digital clock which can be Swallowed?  The
ones I have from my SuSE distribution don't tick away the seconds.

You can use

  xclock -update 1

or

  rclock -update 1 

or 
  
  asclock -update 1

FYI, my AnotherLevelUp package allows you to *persistently* switch on and off
the Wharf from the System Utilities menu (i.e. it starts up if you had it up
when you logged off).

Jake: I shall have a `pre-release' RPM available later today(!). I shall email
you the URL.

One of the things I truly enjoy about fvwm is the ability to use
the keyboard.  I have not been able to figure out how to get gnome to do
anything useful with it.  Is there a way to make the Gnome menu activate
with from a fvwm command or key?

I really like things like my:

Key Escape      A       C       Popup "Utilities"
...
+ "&Applications     %mini-x2.xpm%"          Popup   Applications
+ "&Emacs%mini-edit.xpm%"        Exec emacs &

... and would like to trigger the Gnome menu also.  Does Gnome allow any
hooks into itself?  Or must one only access the menus only through the
point & click?

If you want to get native gnome menus using fvwm bindings, you need the
gnome-compliant fvwm version, i.e. the development one. Search the man
page for GnomeButton command.

If you want to get native fvwm menus, which launch gnome applications, you
probably will find the script fvwm-menu-desktop, installed by development
fvwm versions, useful (KDE also supported). Try 'man fvwm-menu-desktop'.

Please don't expect development versions to be bug free.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks, 
  I tried the 
       GnomeButton
              Used in conjunction with Mouse to pass mouse button
              presses on the root window to a GNOME program (such
              as GMC).  The following example passes  presses  of
              mouse buttons 1 and 3 to such a program.

                   Mouse 1 R A GnomeButton
                   Mouse 3 R A GnomeButton

but this looks like it passes Mouse (and maybe keypresses?) transparently.
And fvwm-menu-desktop looks closer, but makes me really believe that there
is no hook on the gnome side like:

# in my .fvwm2rc for Fvwm Version 2.3.15 :
AddToMenu "StartMenu"
+ "&Gnome Panel" Exec panel MainMenu::Activate
...

Bummer.  Basically, it looks like one uses this command to recreate all
the menus in fvwm.  I don't really know gnome, and it all it buys me is a
few new applications, maybe it isn't worth the effort involved in
learning it.  I'll give fvwm-menu-desktop a try and see what they have
though.

Thanks,

You should also run a program, which will catch these presses.
Just have runned gmc, executed these commands (for me it is better to
substitute 'A' with 'S') and got buttons 1 and 3 working well on root.

I suppose that the panel does not export their menus, thus you can only
popup panel's menus from the panel itself. You can use fvwm-menu-desktop
to create gtk menus, so they will look similarly to the panel's ones.

This means that you have to install flex or lex first before
you can install fvwm.  I'm not exactly sure why it is needed,
but I assume some module can't be built without it.

This can easily be implemented using FvwmButtons and the
'StaysOnTop' style.  Just define a small button bar with
the icons you need and use

  Style FvwmButtons Sticky, StaysOnTop

Hello here :)

I use point-to-focus focus style. I made a desktop with four screens:

DeskTopSize 1 1
*FvwmPagerRows 1
*FvwmPagerColumns 4

and bound C-M-right and C-M-left to cicle between these screens:

Key Left	A	CM	Desk -1 0 3
Key Right	A	CM	Desk 1 0 3

I made several windows sticky. I move a mouse pointer into a sticky window
to made it focused, then press C-M-right (or left) to move to another
screen (mouse pointer is still in the same window) and get in unfocused so
I have to move pointer outside of it and back inside to make is focused on
the new screen again. I want to make window under pointer to be always
focused when I switch screens. How can I do it?

Thanks in advance.

Hello here :)

I use FvwmButtons and FvwmTask bar. So I do not use icons at all. I have a
SUN keyboard with additional SUN keys so I bound Open (F17) to close the
focused window. I also use point-to-focus focus style. When I occasionally
move a pointer to FvwmButtons or FvwmTask windows and press Open that
window is closed and actually disappears because I cannot restore it by
icon and it is not shown in window list. How can I protect a window from
being ever closed?

Thanks in advance.

  is there by any chance a Close (F??) key that you could map to open
new xterm? :-)

  the close (unlike destroy) can be ignored by application (at least
that's what I see some applications doing), but I am not sure if you can
do that from outside of the application.

  there is another solution though: you can make window unfocusable, so
that it never gets focus or make it so that it needs a click to get
focus. one of those might solve you problem., here's an example:

Style "oclock"          StaysOnTop, NoTitle, Sticky, \
                        WindowListSkip, ClickToFocus

  this way, the clock does not get focus when the mouse is over it and
thus would not get closed. note that the general policy can still be
point to focus, it is just changed for the particular wondow...

Hey!

Does fvwm support any type of screen locking? The ideal sol'n would be to have
the X environment locked so I don't always have to log out when I leave my
system...

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks in advance,
Dan

Fvwm doesn't handle screen locking. You could just run "xlock" or
"xscreensaver" to lock your terminal. One of those ships with almost every
Xwindows on the market.

I have xautolock working with fvwm on Solaris 2.6.  
You set it up in the Xsession.fv2 file  right before the
window manager something like:

	/usr/local/X11/bin/autolock -time 10 -locker '/usr/openwin/bin/xlock
-allowroot -mode life' &
	/usr/openwin/bin/xconsole -iconic -geometry +2-2 &
	/usr/local/bin/fvwm2

Yes, if you have one of the 2.3.x beta versions.  With

  Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus

FvwmButtons will not get the focus if you move the mouse over
it, so it won't be closed with your key stroke.

Which fvwm version do you use?  This works perfectly for me with
the latest development code (2.3.15 beta release).

Thank you for your answer (about not closing windows too). I use Fvwm
2.2.4. Guess I have to wait for a new stable release.

After seeing the message in fvwm-workers about an "icon launcher" using
FvwmButtons, I got the idea of using FvwmIconMan to put up a transient window
containing certain windows that I am interested in.

Since I don't normally use the numeric keypad on the right of my keyboard, I
have assigned certain keys to cycle between open windows of a certain type.
For instance, Keypad Enter (KP_Enter) will cycle through all my Netscape
windows.

I decided to create a similar function that is called when the Shift key is
pressed to just display a list of the windows, and allow the user to select
the desired window.  This is most useful with XTerms (as my icon title tells
me which system I'm connected to and as what user).

The problem is that it seems that there doesn't seem to be a way to clear
FvwmIconMan's concept of show/dontshow windows.  If I send FvwmIconMan a new
"show" line, it appends to its current list instead of replacing it.

Thus, I need to add a DestroyModuleConfig and reset ALL the FvwmIconMan
control lines in my function.

Is there a better way to get the functionality I need?

I've attached a minimal configuration to show what I am doing.

Second question:  is there any way to tell FvwmIconMan to pop up in the CENTER
of the screen instead of where the mouse is located?  Since I am launching
FvwmIconMan via keystroke, popping up at the mouse location isn't very useful.
Since the fvwm2 CursorMove function only moves the cursor relatively (I cannot
say "CursorMove 50 50" to place the cursor at the precise center of the
screen), it looks like absolute positioning is not available in fvwm2.  Is
this correct or is there a workaround for this?

My config file is below:

Hello here :)

I use FvwmTaskBar and encountered two strange things with it.

1. It does not display any mail button when I have new mail even though I have
#define MINI_ICONS 1
in config.h file.

2. When I press the Start button a menu is called but it stays depressed
untill I restart task bar.

My task bar settings are the following:

*FvwmTaskBarGeometry +0-0
*FvwmTaskBarAutoStick
*FvwmTaskBarUseSkipList
*FvwmTaskBarUseIconNames
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 Iconify -1,Raise, Focus
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Focus, Iconify
*FvwmTaskBarShowTips
#*FvwmTaskBarMailCommand Exec exec xterm -e pine
*FvwmTaskBarMailCommand Desk 2
*FvwmTaskBarSelFont 6x9
*FvwmTaskBarFont 6x9
*FvwmTaskBarStatusFont 7x13
*FvwmTaskBarFore navy
*FvwmTaskBarBack cadetblue
*FvwmTaskBarTipsBack lightyellow
#*FvwmTaskBarHighlightFocus
*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu RootMenu
*FvwmTaskBarBellVolume 100
*FvwmTaskBarMailBox /var/mail/gregory

Thanks in advance.

I don't think it's possible (of course you can use FvwmEvent).

Can you type two enhancement request for this in Jitterbug?

Please try if this still is the case with the latest beta releases.
I think there was a fix a while ago, but I'm not sure.

This is fixed since the 2.3.1 beta release.

Thank you, I upgraded to fvwm
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.15 compiled on Apr 14 2000 at 15:07:02
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  ReadLine RPlay Stroke XPM IMLIB Session
beta and a lot of things started to ork as I want them to :)

But... I encountered two new problems with task bar.

1. The mail mini icon started to appear when I get new mail but the action
that I want it to do (switch to desk 2 where my mailer lives) does not
work, it just makes the icon blank.

2. Something is wrong with task bar tips now. Instead of showing little
yellow window with window name it shows two strange lines, somewhat like
this:

                                    |
        ----------------------------+
---------------------------------------------------
[Start] [Netsca...] [Netsca...] [Netsca...] [18:00]
---------------------------------------------------
           ^
         Mouse pointer

The length of the bottom line seems to be the same as needed for the tip
but no text is drawn... :(

My task bar settings are the following.
# FvwmTaskBar
*FvwmTaskBarGeometry +0-0
*FvwmTaskBarAutoStick
*FvwmTaskBarUseSkipList
*FvwmTaskBarUseIconNames
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 Iconify -1,Raise, Focus

When i add the line Style * StippledTitle  or   Style "*" StippledTitle  in
my .fvwm2rc , then i became after start fvwm2 in the xmessages

You don't say which release of fvwm you are using.

Check your man page, in the release you have, stippledtitles may
be a GlobalOpt.

As soon as we can figure out when this changed, we will fix the FAQ
so it indicates when this became a style option.

Hello,

I am using fvwm 2.2.2.  I am switching over from Enlightenment since I
would like something with a bit more configurability.  One thing I cannot
figure out.  It seems man GTK applications do not accept a -geometry
option.  How can you place a GTK application at a certain screen position
under fvwm2?  Is this a limitation of GTK applications?

Thanks,

-Dave

I finally had the time to check this myself.  The latest
cvs sources (fvwm) do grant Eterm's -x option.  Furthermore
I checked the latest stable Eterm versions (0.8.9 and 0.8.10).
Eterm *does* use Motif hints, so I think we don't have to do
anything here.  The problem probably was temporarily caused by
some of my 'Style' changes.  Or are there any reasons why this
still is a problem?

One click blank the icon (you see that a mail arrives and so you will see
if a new one arrives). Double click will do the action you want.

I'm unable to reproduce this problem. The tip work normally on my machine
with your config. You say that you have two strange lines and that's all.
This is strange: do you have a black box that "fill" this 2 lines? May be
you can send a little screen shot to the fvwm-workers@fvwm.org mailing
list.

Answer to the following questions may help debugging
- What happen if you use 
*FvwmTaskBarTipsBack white
*FvwmTaskBarTipsFore black
- Do you have the same problem if netscape does not run. 
Say that you can make a test with only an xterm running. 
Netscape use a lot of colors and can cause problems. There are 
solutions to solve this but I do not know them.

Sorry for the late reply.  I tried this with xload, and for
me FvwmWharf simply refuses to swallow it if it's larger than
48x48 pixels.  This seems to be a bug in FvwmWharf.  We'll
investigate this.

	Hello all.

	I just installed v2.3.15 on my Linux box (Debian Slink) which
used to run v2.2.2 without problems. I modified my configuration file
according to notes in output from fvwm2 running my old config. Then
v2.3.15 died with segmentation fault after reading all the config
file without reporting errors.
	I can post my config file, but first let me know if I made a
mistake in grabbing that version.
	Fab.

I got that wrong didn't I.  Eterm -x stopped working at just about the
same time as the the reparenting structure changed and I thought that
was the reason. Never mind, just ignore me, looks like this bug is
fixed.

As soon as we can figure out when this changed, we will fix the FAQ
so it indicates when this became a style option.

I changed FvwmTaskBarTipsBack and FvwmTaskBarTipsFore as you wrote and
restarted without netscape, tips still don't work though in xcmap I see a
lot of free colors. I don't think it problem is because of lack of colors.
Tips in FvwmPager work ok, on task bar they don't :(

I encountered one more problem with new task bar:

I have *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly in my config. If windows made stiky by style
command, they are shown on task bar on every desk. If I have a window that
is not stiky originally and make it stiky by pressing one of the buttons on
the title bar

Mouse 0		3       A       Stick

and then move to the other desk, it's shown on the screen but not shown on
the task bar.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

It is a Global option in that version of fvwm2.  If you search the man
pages or the FAQ you should find reference to=20

GlobalOpts StipledTitles

Tom

Along those lines, it's not hard to mock up the same, or different,=20
appearance with a vector button, but unfortunately it is drawn over=20
(or under, I can't remembe which right now) the text.  Is there a simple
way in the configuration to avoid the text, or is this why there's an
option for StiplesTitles; 'cause it's easiest to do at the coding level.

Did you see this problem, Tim?  I didn't have the time to
test it when it was reported.

Hello here :)

I have. I have some minor problem with FvwmPager. As I've written earlier I
have four desks and move through them using keyboard (Alt+right and
Alt+left keys). I have several windows stiky (like irc, icq, console).

I have several windows on one desk, some of them are stiky. I move one
non-stiky window to the top of all of them, it is shown correctly on the
pager. Then I move to another desk and return back. On the screen I see the
non-stiky window still on the top of all. On the pager I see the stiky
windows on top of non-stiky ones... Here are the pictures describing what I
see. Console and irc are stiky, mail is not.

On the screen:

+----------------------------------------------+
|+-Console----------+                          |

| +----------+                                 |
+----------------------------------------------+

Is it a bug or an intended feature and if it's intended how can I make
pager to show me the true positions of the windows?

Thanks in advance.

First of all, upgrade to 2.3.16.  It has several core dump fixes
in the style code.  If the problem persists, please post your config
and a stack trace.

Just a note:  the link to 2.3.16 on the Fvwm web page is broken.  There's not
fvwm-2.3.16.tar.gz in the version-2 directory on the ftp server.

So, upgrading isn't that easy unless one wants to use the daily snapshots,
something that I personally don't do since my machine is used for "production"
work.

I assume that Jason will get around to making the distribution available some
time today.

Hello,

As in the subject, I'm having trouble getting XPM, and thus colored icons
to work in fvwm. This server was recently given a clean install of Solaris 7
8/99, and then patched with the most recent Sun recommended patch set
for Solaris 7. The server itself is a Sun clone (please don't laugh). The
processor on a psrinfo -v says "sparcv9 processor running at 360 MHz"

Anyway, I compiled XPM 3.4K. I put the X11 includes in /usr/local/include
and the lib files in /usr/local/lib. I ran configure as follows:

LDFLAGS=-R/usr/local/lib
./configure --without-cxx --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/lib
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/include

The make ran with most gcc comands using the "-lXpm" flag.

The icons themsleves are in /usr/local/icons.

The configure.log file contains no references to errors involving Xpm.

If I am not providing enough information, please write back, and I'll
provide what
I can. If not, then thanks in advance for your assistance!

You should have seen  something like this at the  end of the configure
step:

Configuration:

  FVWM Version:                    2.3.16

  Have ReadLine support?           yes
  Have RPlay support?              no
  Have Stroke support?             no
  Have XPM support?                yes
                                   ^^^

If you see "yes", then you have successfully compiled in XPM support.

Let us know what version of fvwm you are using.
If you've got compiled in support, send the parts of your .fvwm2rc where
you try to use the icons.  Depending on the release you are using, check
your PixmapPath, or ImagePath.

X programs expect all headers to be in an X11 directory under the
include directory.  That is, they all do things like:

  #include <X11/xpm.h>

So, you need to copy that header to /usr/local/include/X11/xpm.h, not
/usr/local/include/xpm.h.

Don't know if that helps; you definitely should have seen some kind of
message about XPM not being found correctly in the configure output if
it didn't work.

Hi,

We like these discussions to stay on the fvwm list so please
respond to "fvwm@fvwm.org" instead of to the person that answers.

In 2.2.4, You should use "ImagePath" only.  The other 2 commands
"PixmapPath" and "IconPath" still work but they are obsolete.

You should not use an equal sign as you show above, the statement
should look like:

ImagePath /usr/local/icons:+

(Use the ":+" at the end to augment the builtin path.)

You can build in the correct path and completly remove the ImagePath
statement from your .fvwm2rc.  Do "./configure --help" to see how.

I think this is a limitation of GTK applications. AFAIK, their ideology is
that a window manager should manage window placement. Some GTK applications
implement --geometry themselves (gtop, gless), but only size, not position.

You can use FvwmEvent module, something like this:

# ------------------------------------------------------
DestroyFunc PlaceMyGtkApps
AddToFunc   PlaceMyGtkApps
+ I Next (gtop) Move 100p 100p
+ I Next (gcalc) AnimatedMove 10 10
+ I Next (ghex) Move pointer
+ I Next (gtcd) Move -0 0 Warp

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEventCmd
*FvwmEvent add_window Function PlaceMyGtkApps
Module FvwmEvent
# ======================================================

I didn't test this with 2.2.2, only with the current fvwm.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Guys,

    For the 100 times I need help so please if you can do something help
me out with
my problem.

I tried to install fvwm on a SunOs  5.6 Generic_105181-17 sun4u sparc
SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-Engine
(solaris 2.6) but when I ran "./configure" I got the following error:

   checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C compiler
cannot create executables.

Even though I have both gcc and cc compilers. I wish someone can help me

out with
that.

Thanks

That probably means your GCC compiler is installed incorrectly.  In any
case, it can't be used to build executables; have you ever managed to
get it to build any executables on this system, even a trivial "hello
world" program?

Look at the config.log file to see why it failed.

Not really.  Your GCC hasn't been properly installed.  This is a problem
for GCC folks, not us.  Once your compiler works, if you then have
problems building FVWM, please contact us again.  You should be able to
do this:

  $ cat > hello.c <<EOF
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main() { printf("Hello world!\n"); return 0; }
  EOF

  $ gcc -o hello hello.c

  $ ./hello
  Hello world!

Once that works, you know your compiler is OK.

BTW, you can get pre-built versions of most GNU tools, including GCC,
for most Sun platforms in Sun package format for easy installation at:

HTH.

	Hello all.

	Ok, I managed to receive and configure 2.3.16 and it doesn't core anymore.
	First, I can't connect to the web page or the bug traking system, so perhaps
my remarks are uninteresting, excuse me in this case.

	I configured FvwmWinList to geometry +0-0 and TitleAtBottom. But it refuses
to stay there and wants approximatively +0-16. Without TitleAtBotton, in fact with
NoTitle, all is correct. Not a great deal.

	I experienced some very strange behavior with some kind of windows. I use
DecWindows (xterm in OpenVms language :-) which are VT300 compliant and run on a remote
server. All other windows work well but these appear with random geometries. Sometime
they flicker before ending with very small sizes... They doesn't act like this in v2.2.2.
	Fab.

Yes, this is a bug. As a temporary workaround, you can execute
'Style FvwmWinList TitleAtBottom' *after* FvwmWinList is on the screen
by adding '+ I Wait FvwmWinList' to StartFunction.

You should supply more info. What does 'random geometries' mean?
Consider to report this to fvwm-workers list.
Probably output of 'xwininfo -size' on these windows may help.

P.S. Can you please keep your mail window at 80 columns (74 max in line)?

Regards,
Mikhael.

All,

I've been a FVWM user since before version 1.24r.

For the past month I've been using Gnome with (I hate to say it) Sawmill as the
WM.

While Sawmill is very nice (you can set everything via an interface with Gnome)
it lacks the dexterity that I've been able to accomplish with FVWM.  It does
have an advantage setting curtain style settings via a GUI.  It's pretty nice.

I am using version 2.3.16 of FVWM and I have been able to run FVWM with no
apparent major problems in Gnome (I do have some small ones that are probable
loser errors). I do however have a couple of questions.

Does anyone know if the Gnome panel can dock/swallow FVWM's pager?

Will FVWM ever give the user the ability to "Modify" FVWM's settings (Styles,
TitleStyles, etc...) via Gnome?  While I don't mind doing things by hand, I have
users who prefer a GUI interface to these things.

Any FVWM/Gnome pointers would be greatly appreciated.

"Sun's gcc compiler"?  Sun has its own compiler, but it's not GCC.

Yes, just like any other window. Also if you compiled with GNOME support,
you should be able to use a native GNOME pager (there are several ones).

Noone can say for sure. Maybe, after the new WM standard will be out.

Currently the project fvwm-themes aims to provide this functionality,
but not yet, it will be more ready when fvwm-2.4 will be out.

Not very much. But FVWM has usable GNOME and session management support.

Mikhael.

It is not a feature, pager should show the real world, so it is a bug.
Please always tell us the fvwm version when reporting problems (you should
test over the latest stable or unstable one). When reporting bugs, it is
very helpful if you show how it is possible to reproduce them. Thank you.

>You should supply more info. What does 'random geometries' mean?
	It probably means that my english is a little
poor :-)
	I meant that instead of a 132x24 (columnsxrows)terminal
I get a 40x40 one or a 20x10 and even once a 10x1. I think it's
the DecWindow application fault. But I don't know where.

	Ok, I'll gather those informations and post it to the

	For some internal reasons, I can't force my mailer to

Excuse-me.

I upgraded to
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.16 compiled on Apr 20 2000 at 13:11:17
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  ReadLine RPlay Stroke XPM IMLIB Session
and the bug is still here. As for how to reproduce it, I think I described
it all well enough. In short:

1. On a desk where you have several overlapping sticky and not stiky
windows bring the not sticky window to the front.
2. Switch to another desk.
3. Return back to the desk where you started.
4. On the screen you will see the not sticky window on top of others, on
the pager you will see sticky windows on top of it.

Hope it helps.

I can easily reproduce this.

Hi - I'm not 100% sure if this is an Fvwm thing or an xterm thing, but:

I'm trying to use the 'activeIcon' functionality of the xfree86 xterm
[patch #132], in fvwm 2.2.4: basically I want iconified xterms to accept
input: I can verify that the xterms have activeIcon support compiled in:
If I remove the 'Icon' entry from their styles, I see a miniaturised
version of an xterm when I iconify them, and I'm _almost certain_ that in
the past, they used [in a version of fvwm 2.0.x, I think]  to accept input
in this state as well, but they don't seem to do that any more. Rxvts
still accept input when iconified. Is there something extra I need to do
to get fvwm 2.2.x to supply input to iconified xterms? [The xterm
documentation states that the activeIcon input stuff works with fvwm]

Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? [I've specified 'Lenience' in the xterm 
style, just in case]

They both have the follwing in ther Identify info:

Focus Policy: Passive
- Input Field: True
- WM_TAKE_FOCUS: Absent

Anybody have any ideas about this? Is there something I need to
set/compile in to fvwm? Or should I direct my attention back towards
xterm?

There were some fixes to the 'active icon' related code in fvwm
in the 2.3.x beta releases.  Try if the latest beta (2.3.16)
shows the same symptoms.

I'm afraid that seems to dump core as soon as anything that takes input
[ xterm, rxvt, xcalc is opened, [at least for the one I compiled anyway]

Hi,

I am new to the list and to fvwm..Great Window Manager!
I have looked around for the answer to the following questions but could not
find the answer anywhere.  So here are the questions:

1) Can the builtin function WindowList show the window list of windows in
the current page only? I know that there is no direct option for this but is
there any work arounds? Any plans to add such an option?
2) Is it possible for the  WindowList to show oinly windows associated with
a certain style only (so that I can make it show windows of a certain
application only, e.g. frame maker)?
3) Can I make the result of WindowList such that certain listings have a
different style (eg color) than others (so that for example all xterms can
show up with a blue background, framemaker stuff with green, etc.).

Thanks very much.

Arya

Try

  WindowList (CurrentPage)

Yes:

  WindowList (my_window_name)

> 3) Can I make the result of WindowList such that certain listings have a
> different style (eg color) than others (so that for example all xterms

Yes.  The MenuStyle command controls the look of the window list.
The WindowList menu uses the menustyle 'WindowList'.  This can be
changed between two invocations.

e.g.

  AddToFunc WindowListXterms
  + MenuStyle WindowList <whatever styles you like>
  + WindowList (xterm, currentpage)

  AddToFunc WindowListEmacs
  + MenuStyle WindowList <styles>
  + WindowList (emacs)

Start the WindowList by calling the appropriate function.

All this only works with the 2.3.x beta releases, though.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hi - I'm having a little trouble getting PipeRead to behave as I expect
in 2.2.4: 

I have the following function:

AddToFunc make_module_menu
+	"I"	DestroyMenu Module-Popup
+	"I"	AddToMenu   Module-Popup	FOO	Title
+	"I"	PipeRead    'for m in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/*; do X=`basename $m`; echo -e "AddToMenu\tModule-Popup\t\"$X\"\tNop"; done'

The title of the menu gets set, but there are no entries in it.
When I run the above shell command by hand, I get the following output:

AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmAnimate"   Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmAudio"     Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmAuto"      Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmBacker"    Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmBanner"    Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmButtons"   Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmCommandS"  Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmConfig"    Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmConsole"   Nop
AddToMenu       Module-Popup    "FvwmConsoleC"  Nop

Which looks Ok to me: In fact, when I add those lines explicitly as + "I"
elements of the make_module_menu, they show up: Is PipeRead relatively
fussy/flaky? DO I need to move up to the latest betas to get it working?
[ For a while I got it to generate a menu with the correct number of
  entries, but it seemed to insist on picking the wrong word as the menu
  label, and now I don't even seem to be able to produce that ]

We like these discussions to stay on the fvwm list.

You can search for InitFunction in the fvwm2 man page and find that if you
run fvwm under a session manager (gnome-session in your case, I suppose),
SessionInitFunction is called instead. Or you can use StartFunction, which
is always called.

> How does one add FvwmPager to a GNOME panel?

It is possible by creating a swallowed app. You should start a pager in
StartFunction or using 'FvwmCommand FvwmPager' command of swallowed app
(start FvwmCommandS in StartFunction then). Use pager label as a title.

But I don't suggest this method, it is very problematic, a panel now
requires a FvwmPager (and fvwm) to be run and you don't see a pager
without a panel. I suggest to use a pager separately from a panel.
And a panel sometimes crashes for me when I want to swallow something.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am commenting the current version, but I don't think there were changes
in PipeRead parsing from 2.2.4. Solutions:

1) Quote all backslashes in your PipeRead line with backslash: \\.
2) Create a small shell script and PipeRead it.
3) Rewrite your last line to be simplier:

  + I PipeRead 'for m in `ls /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2`; echo "AddToMenu Module-Popup $m Nop"; done'

Regards,
Mikhael.

In order to use fvwm2 with RedHat, simply create the file .xsession
in your home with the following line:

$HOME/.xinitrc

Then chmod 755 .xsession, and
create your .xinitrc an .fvwm2rc normally.
Restart X and voila'!
Bye,

Try this:  WindowShade a window, then iconify it.  Now drag it to a
different screen, and de-iconify it.  Now, un-WindowShade it, and it
appears on the previous screen!  This is in version 2.3.16.

I decided to put xdaliclock in my InitFunction and RestartFunction.  Is
there a way to make that window (and only that window) "sticky?"

Style "xdaliclock" Sticky

Probably it is not needed to restart a clock, but you know better.

Hi Guys,

    First thanks for all of who answered my questions. But questions
never end. In fact,
after I install fvwm, how to make it work? I replaced 'olvwm' by 'fvwm2'
in '.xinitrc'
and I got nothing. I had to reboot my machine with CDE to make it work
again.
I hope you can help me.

Thanks

If you are using a 2.2.x version, copy
"sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc" to $HOME/.fvwm2rc
and make the changes you want.  Then start fvwm again.

If you are using a 2.3.x version, click on the background or hit F1.

In fvwm2rc I did the following:

    Style "XTerm"       Icon xterm1.xpm ....

xterm1.xpm is
another icon.

Thanks for help

Whats the "standard icon"?

Order matters with Style statements.

You need to put the most general Style statements first:

Style "*" Icon default.xpm
Style "XTerm" Icon xterm1.xpm

Use FvwmIdent to find the names associated with your xterm window.
For me its:

Name: fork -- /u/dane
Class: XTerm
Resource: xterm

The style statement can match any one of these.

If I had:

Style "XTerm" Icon xterm1.xpm
Style "f*" Icon fork.xpm

the second one would be used.

Hope this helps.

Sounds like you never did "make install".

Just plain  make  might  leave  the modules  in  a  bunch of  separate
directories, but "make install" would install them in one place.

If you don't want to install in the default location, you can change
that at configure time.  For example:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/fvwm224
make
make install

Hi all,

I recently installed fvwm 2.2.4 and encountered the "module failed 
Permission Denied" error when my InitFunction tried to load FvwmButtons, 
etc.

I checked my ModulePath and the permissions on the directory and files, 
everything looked OK... The executables for the various modules were in 
separate directories under the fvwm2.2.4/modules dir. Later I found out that 
these executables need to be in a common directory, so I manually moved them 
to a common directory.

Now my question is, is there an option in the Makefile that will do this, 
i.e., move the executables to a common directory I tried looking thru the 
Makefile, but my inexperience proved too much for me!!

Someone kindly let me know if such a simple solution does exist.

Thanks,

nitin

Hello,

is it possible to mix colors/fonts in window titles.
e.g. in from my shell I can write on the window title
with
    echo "<esc>]2;fred <ctrl-g>"
and I'd like to have something like
    echo "<esc>]2;fred <red>lola</red><ctrl-g>"
where red turns on red.

  I don't believe so. You might achieve that sort of thing by having a
script to call gimp/image-magick to generate a correctly-sized XPM with
the required coloured text in it, then setting that as the title-pixmap
style for a given window ID, but you'd *really* have to want that coloured
text!

seems like `for every simple problem there's an awkward solution'.
anyway: thank you!

In case you are wandering, this is a spam written in russian... Apparently

Detailed translation will be omitted for obvious reasons...

TWIMC:

I have perused fvwm.org's links for about an hour, so
perhaps I'm being lazy or slow, but I would like to alter
an attribute that is driving me a little bit crazy, and
I can find no old mailings on this topic, or anything in the FAQ
(but again, maybe it's me).

When I pull the scroll bar to the bottom IF I pull a mm too far,
it "bounces" up to the top. What I want is for it to be left
at the bottom. This happens under XFree86-3.3.5-3 running RH6.1 Linux.

I have a "bare" .fvwmrc file, apart from these minor alterations (supplied
by one of our grad students).

Any help would be appreciate.

The  only scrollbars that  I can think of  that Fvwm  controls are the
ones  in  FvwmScroll.  It  doesn't sound   like  you are referring  to
FvwmScroll.

Fvwm doesn't control the scrollbars in applications.
