fvwm (and window managers in general), don't monitor all keystrokes.

21MB sounds large for a source distribution, maybe what you were told
about the download size wasn't correct.

Dan,

MaxWindowSize worked great. 

This did not exist in the fvwm2 man page because I was running the V2.2.4
released version. I installed V2.3.20 and was then able to find MaxWindowSize
in the fvwm2 man page. 

Thanks,
Geoff.

Hello!

How can I copy contents of one Menu to another.
I mean, I made menus 'menu1' and 'menu2'. Then I filled
menu1 with something. How can i copy all contents of menu1 to menu2, so
i can delete menu1?


Thanks.

There is no special way in FVWM to get this functionality.
If you take a look at FVWM's FAQ sections 3.5 and 3.6 you can find an info
about xse utility, it creates synthetic X keyboard events.

  ftp://ftp.inria.fr/X/contrib-R5/clients/xse-2.1.tar.Z

Some apps disable syntetic events by default; 'Allow SendEvent' for xterm.

In addition, in fvwm 2.3 versions, you can use $n or $w variables to get
the name or window id of the window in the function's context.

Regards,
Mikhael.

In your FvwmButtons configuration:

  *FvwmButtons(... Container(Rows 8 Columns 2) ...)

but:

  *FvwmButtons(3x2 ...)  # you request 3 columns, while you allocate 2

then:

  *FvwmButtons(... Container(Rows 3 Columns 2) ...)

but:

  *FvwmButtons(4x1 ...) # you request 4 columns, while you allocate 2

Try to draw squares on the paper first. :) Please remember that logical
sizes like 2x2 are different inside and outside of every container. When
you start a new container, sizes in it are independant from the parent.
I would not suggest to specify Geometry until you get the desired layout.

Example:

       1   2   3   4

     +---+-----------+
   1 |               |
     |               |
   2 |               |
     +-------+-------+
   3 |       |       |
     +-------|       |
   4 |       |       |
     +---+---+-------+

You don't need any containers if you specify sizes and in the right order.
  [4x2, 2x1, 2x2, 2x1]  # if not sure, containers may sometimes help

You can add one container:
  [1x1, 1x1 of Container[2x1, 2x2, 2x1]]  # is it better?

You can add one more container:
  [1x1, 1x1 of Container[1x1 of Container[1x1, 1x1], 1x1]]  # this is it :)

Mikhael.

fvwm does not create 'etc' directory, but it is supported, i.e. if you
create 'etc' directory yourself and put system.fvwm2rc into it, this file
will be read for users without .fvwm2rc file. This means you should find
and install system.fvwm2rc or .fvwm2rc yourself. There are some samples.

The current developement version (pre-2.4) have two internal ways of
creating an initial configuration for you from the default root menu,
the third way is to install fvwm-themes package. All three use ~/.fvwm dir.

Mikhael.

Hi, All.

I have installed fvwm 2.2.4, and everything is working well except
FvwmButtons. It is also working except that it doesn't show icons on the
buttons. I have set IconPath and PixmapPath in my .fvwm2rc file. Is there
anything else I have to do?

Jack Christenson

You can't copy menu items dynamically as of now.

If you simply need a way to avoid a duplication, you can create a function
to add to your menus and call it several times:

  AddToFunc AddBrowserItemsToMenu
  + I AddToMenu $0 "%mini/www.xpm%Mozilla" Exec exec mozilla
  + I AddToMenu $0 "%mini/www.xpm%Galeon" Exec exec galeon
  + I AddToMenu $0 "%mini/www.xpm%Lynx" Exec exec xterm -n lynx -e lynx
  + I AddToMenu $0 "" Nop

  AddBrowserItemsToMenu MyMenu1
  AddBrowserItemsToMenu MyMenu2

Mikhael.

Hi,

Simple question.  I've been using fvwm for some time now but
always the latest stable release.  I thought I might try living a little
more on the edge and use some of the beta code to explore some of the
theme work and new features which are being put into fvwm.  Any
suggestions on:

1) Themes?  I've been using a hacked AnotherLevel m4 configuration.  How
far has the themes work progressed?

2) New features, etc.  Am I reading the man pages like a book to find out
what's new or is something else written up?

3) Suggestion on which release to try and why?  How to get it?  etc?

Thanks for reading such a boring email, :-)

Tom

One more question.  Has there been any thought of including some scripting
abilities into the .fvwm2rc files such as a simple include, or has it been
decided to leave this sort of thing to m4 or cpp pre-processing?

Look at the "docs/ANNOUNCE" file.

The latest snapshot.  Its very stable.  Check the download section at
www.fvwm.org.

Fvwm's "read" command does this.

"How far" depends on what you expect to have at the end, maybe it already
has everything you need. You are welcome to try and comment.

There is a NEWS file containing all new features and changes.

Yes and no. There are several preprocessings in rc file, mainly expending
special variables, like $n, $d in certain contexts, environment variables
$[USER] and more. And PipeRead command provides shell scripting abilities.

Thanks Dan and Mikhael,

I should have upgraded to the latest snapshot a long time ago!  I like the
changes that have been made, moving everything to ~/.fvwm (by default) and
making use of a read ConfigFvwm____ .

Tell me, can an environment variable be used like this?

read decors/$[DECORS]

where DECORS is an environment variable?  When is the read actually done?

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything on this in the man pages.

In case you can't tell, I'm going to play a little game and see if I can't
replace the functionality of AnotherLevel (Hopefully improve upon it) by
using just the commands allowed in fvwm. :-)  These days it just seems to
big and cumbersome to me.

Tom

Read works with environment variables.
I couldn't find it in the man page either.  Could have sworn it
was there...

Read is a blocking command, it is done immediately when encountered.
This command existed since fvwm 2.0 versions.

% man fvwm2
/\$\[            - jumps to 'COMMAND LINE PARAMETER EXPANSION' section

> Read works with environment variables.

Dan, maybe you mean Restart, it works with $DECORS without braces too.

Every fvwm command works with $[DECORS] starting from 2.3.19, i.e. this is
replaced with the contents of the DECORS environment variable if exists,
or left as is if not exists.

Mikhael.

You are right of course.

I think that section should be titled "COMMAND PARAMETER EXPANSION".
The term "command line" is used earlier in the page with a different
meaning.

No, this is enough. You can also use ImagePath instead of obsolete
commands IconPath and PixmapPath starting from fvwm 2.2.4.

Can you see icons at all? Supposing you have xterm.xpm in your ImagePath
(or PixmapPath), do you see this icon when iconifying xterm after:

  Style "xterm" Icon xterm.xpm

If no, check again your *Path commands; did you compile with xpm support?
If yes, there is a problem with your FvwmButtons config, I guess.

Mikhael.

Hi, here's a feature of twm that I really liked.  In my .twmrc I have

WindowRing {"emacs" "xdvi" "Ediff" "ghostview"}
"L5"    = 	: all		: f.warpring "next"

Then I can hit L5 and it toggles between my Emacs & Xdvi windows.  Is
there an fwm analogue of this?

Also, where can I get more fvwm info?  All I have is the FAQ, which is
helpful, but doesn't tell me how anything works.  

I'm using the Another Level interface, so I have these canned files 

.fvwm2rc.decors .fvwm2rc.defines, .fvwm2rc.defstyles, .fvwm2rc.init

which are pretty good, but I can't read them, to some extent I can
modify them.

Here is an equivalent if I understand twm correctly.

Style "*"	CirculateSkip
Style "emacs"	CirculateHit
Style "xdvi"	CirculateHit
Style "Ediff"	CirculateHit
Style ghostview	CirculateHit
Key L5 A A	Next (!Iconified CurrentDesk) SwitchToWindow

AddToFunc SwitchToWindow
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 10p

There are other solutions not using CirculateSkip/CirculateHit. With some
function programming you can make several window-rings. You can also use
WindowListSkip/WindowListHit style options and WindowList (for example
bound to Alt-Tab) to show only certain applications.

Try 'man fvwm2'. This is your main reference, there are also man pages for
all modules, like FvwmPager, FvwmButtons.

These are most probably m4 files, i.e. they are first preprocessed using
FvwmM4 to get the real fvwm configuration. See 'info m4' for m4 syntax.
It is possible to create ~/.fvwm2rc without any preprocessing.

Why it is written in english...  It's just m4.  For syntax use man m4 or
just learn by example.  It's fairly well written from the point of code
with comments.

>to some extent I can modify them.

That's good.  You should know that the AnotherLevel setup is a RedHat
piece of code and is not directly part of fvwm.

   Man pages are very good.

How dumb of me.  I had my MANPATH set for the Sun network, so I wasn't
getting a fvwm2 man page.  I changed my .bash_profile to now read:

case `uname` in 
        Linux) ;;
        SunOS)  export MANPATH=/home/dehn/richter/man:/usr/tex/man:/usr/net/man:/usr/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/openwin/share/man 
esac

and now I can read the 3383 line long fvwm2 man page!

   Here is an equivalent if I understand twm correctly.

   Style "*"	CirculateSkip
   Style "emacs"	CirculateHit
   Style "xdvi"	CirculateHit

Thanks.  This actually works even better for me:

Style "*"	CirculateSkip

Style "xdvi"	CirculateHit
Style "Ediff"	CirculateHit
Style ghostview	CirculateHit
Key F10 A A	Next (!Iconified CurrentDesk) WarpToWindow 50 30

I put that in my .fvwm2rc.defstyles.  

Now I can recomment 

# Uncomment USE_AUTO_RAISE turn turn on window autoraising by default
# define(`USE_AUTO_RAISE')

in my .fvwm2rc.defines, and also put in .fvwm2rc.defines the command

define(`DESKTOP_SIZE',1x1)

Anyone know the rhyme or reason to all these different AnotherLevel m4
files?  I couldn't find any RedHat info, they just give you the files

and say go have fun.  I can't see what the difference between the
files is, why put something in one file rather than another.

The idea is that it should be self explanitory.  Each file contains
configuration commands which match the file name. 

fvwm2rc.defines.m4 -> user selected defines

fvwm2rc.functions.m4 -> Functions set up by the writers of AnotherLevel to
simplify and define the behaviour of menu selections and the like.

fvwm2rc.xlock.m4 -> A FvwmForm which also makes use of a script to _try_
and figure out what screensavers are available and make a form for user
selection.

fvwm2rc.mouse.m4-> mouse configuration...

 Furthemore, they expect
that the common user will only choose to edit one or two of the files
(putting them in their home directory and renaming them and all that) and
the rest of the files would remain at the system level.  If you want to
use the win95 like interface then that is fine, but you will quickly
become bored as you apparently are and start changing things.

So, the point of the defines is that it is supposed to be like selecting
options and the m4 does the processing to make it happen.

On Sun Ultra10's running Solaris 7 with fvwm95 version 2.0.43a, the task
bar on some systems will disappear, permanently. Reboots or other
remedies have failed to restore the task bar when this happens. A search
of the archives and on Deja News has failed to uncover any mention of
others experiencing this. Anyone have any suggestions for recovering a
lost task bar?

Fvwm95 version 2.0.43a was a spin off from fvwm.  They have their own
web site, but I don't think there's active support.

Fvwm has gone way beyond the capabilities of fvwm95.
I think you will find the taskbar works pretty well too.

  man fvwm

  or

  man fvwm2

  some configuration files are included in distribution, fairly
self-explanatory...

  each module has its own man page, e.g.

  man FvwmButtons

Hi Dan,

Can you please elaborate the better ways in the beta. I downloaded
2.3.20 and read the man page / faq but I did not find a new method.
A pointer is just fine.

Look into StartsOnPage/StartsOnDesk, as well as various Placement
options and the SkipMaping Style. The manpage entries and the FAQ
should get you going.

Hello
I have VFWM running on Sun os, and sometimes i lose the mouse menu, what
i mean is that everything will be working fine, and suddenly for no
apparent reason (as far as i can tell) the mouse menu does no longer
come up when i depress the mouse.

Have any of you ever run across this problem and does anybody know how
to fix this..


thanking you in advance
Steve Rieger

This sounds like the classic NumLock or CapsLock button problem.  Are
either of these turned on?

I'm sorry I don't remember the exact details.  It is described in the FAQ
as well as the man pages.  I also think that there is a command to disable
them. (though it may only be in the betas)  Essentially I think that it is
modifying the signal as it should and fvwm is recognizing them as
different.

Hi, Just wondering if there are plans to make fvwm able to have

see-through xterm windows like GNOME. I thought this was really cool

when I saw it on a coleg's computer. I'm sorry my English is so bad.

I'm trying... Please reply directly to me and this forum. I may not

have a chance to come back often...

Hi
My Meta key (CTRL) doesn't work when Num Lock is turned on. 
For instance I am not able to move between virtual desktops with
ctrl-arrow.
And when I try to use ctrl-S in nedit (save file) I get a <dc3> instead,
and a <etb> when punching ctr-w (close).

Is this a problem with fvwm?
I run redhat 6.2 on a P2. The keyboard is standard IBM-style Keytronic.
It has a converter from 5 pin DIN to PS2 to fit the machine.

I think you're looking for Eterm.  You can run them under any window
manager and yes they allow you to see the root window as the background of
the terminal window.

eg.

$Esetroot MyCoolRootBG.xpm
$Eterm -trans &

and away you go...

fvwm can't catch the internal Netscape triggers. The solution may be not
to use fvwm icons for this resource and use Netscape's ones. Try to
examine the Netscape documentation to see whether and how it is possible
to change the default icons.

Thanks for that tip, but AFAIK affect those options all programs which
have the named window label.
E.g. Setting a StartsOnPage for Netscape means that Netscape will
always start on that page. My apps have one instance which has to be
started during the startup of my fvwm session, but another instance
can be started later within the fvwm session, this instance should
stay on the actual page and not on that for the former one. 
OK, I can change the window label specially for the first instance,
but I do not like that.

Num lock, like shift, ctrl and meta [alt] is generally treated as a
modifier by X. There are 3 things that influence what occurs when you 
get a keypress/mouse click:

Context  [where am I: window, titlebar, root-window, etc]
Modifier [shift, alt, ctrl, meta, num lock]
Key      [The actual key our mouse button pressed]

The modifier control has machanisms to say 

"no modifiers" => N
"any modifier" => A
"Shift+Ctrl"   => SC [I think]
 
or you can specify the combination of modifers, but it's hard to exclude a
specific modifier: you just have to specify the same reponse for all
possible sets of modifers you want to apply. I think the lates betas can
ignore specific modifiers, but I think this is an across the board thing,
not a per action thing. You can also use xmodmap to attach modifiers to
keys:

The following, placed in a file  and read with xmodmap -file <file>

keycode 115 = Super_L
keycode 116 = Super_R

clear Mod4
add Mod4 = Super_L
add Mod4 = Super_R

makes the melted-window keys into 'Super' keys, and then maps the Super
keyboard modifer onto 'Mod4': I can then use 

Key KP_Left     A       4       Scroll -100 +0
 
in my .fvwm2rc [for example] to make [Melted Window] + [Keypad Left] move
me one page to the left in X.

Num lock is usually mapped to Mod2, so Clear Mod2 would probably solve
your numlock proplem.

What are the modifiers on your mouse definitions?
I am using A, which means that wether the num lock is up or down, it works
the
same.  Here is the section defining mouse clicks on the root window
(context R)
from my .fvwm2rc:

############################################################################

# MOUSE Setup
#
# First, the root window. Button 1 brings up the Main Menu. B2 is the
# window operations list, and B3 is the winlist module
#     Button    Context Modifi  Function
Mouse 1         R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop
Mouse 2         R       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 3         R       A       WindowList UseIconName NoGeometry

This causes the function to be called regardless of the modifier (CTRL,
Shift,
NumLock, etc).  If you have seperate function for shift-button1, and
button1
without a modifier, just make 2 entries for each function.  One would have
just
the modifier you want (like C for ctrl), the other would have the modifier
and
3 (like C3).
Look at another section for keys that I use:

############################################################################

# KEYBOARD Setup
#
# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100
Key Left        A       C3      Scroll -100 +0
Key Right       A       C3      Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C3      Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C3      Scroll +0   +100

This is used to scroll to other pages within a desktop.  The 'duplicate'
definitions allow the same functionality in the event the NumLock is on.

Regards
Lou

Also rxvt and aterm, which don't require Esetroot, but will work with

I guess you use 2.2.4, please always specify your fvwm version.
The triangle is constructed as a 3d relief unless you use TrianglesSolid.
In 2.2 versions the shadow and hilight colors of a black background are
black (just like GTK does it by default), so the triangle is invisible.

In the latest betas the default triangle for a black background is
visible, and its exact colors can be specified using colorsets.

Regards,
Mikhael.

  you have to set-up exceed so that it let's you run the window manager
(do not let MS Windows manage windows, don't run HWM), then simply run
exceed and fvwm, what I did is to set up xsession with a fvwm client
(and few other clients, oclock, etc...)

Hey you coders out there,

Just saw "Lain" (see it, if you are into "Manga") - and what did they
use for window-manager... yes, you are right *s*... fvwm2, hmm.

Anyway, I want to change the style of the mouse in the root menu
(instead of this "horizontal double left arrow" - what kind of styles
are there? I tried to use some of "the names" from one of the demo
programs, but it does'nt work. I use SuSE 6.3 with fvwm2 2.2.0 and I
tried this

  CursorStyle ROOT            rigth_ptr

, okay... that's all for now, thanks in advance, nikolaj, copenhagen,
denmark.

You mean right_ptr, not rig*th*_ptr, right?
This cursor context (ROOT) is only available in the betas 2.3.10+.
For 2.2 versions you can run this command in InitFunction or .xinitrc:

  xsetroot -cursor_name right_ptr

Mikhael.

Hi Louis
I'm not sure I understand your solution. The mouse works fine whether
NumLock is on or off. 
I also noticed that the arrows on the numeric pad don't work when
NumLock is off. Below I attach my key and mouse bindings.

It is usually in /usr/X11R6/include/X11 and /usr/include/X11 (symlinked).

% man fvwm2
Search for CursorStyle to learn about all available cursor contexts.
The context you are asking is "SYS".

Hi all,

I've been using fvwm2 as the window manager in GNOME for some time
now... Whenever GNOME starts up, it gets to fvwm2 and there's a long
pause. At first I thought maybe GNOME apps did something special during
system startup, however x2vnc doesn't seem to cause the GNOME startup to
wait for it. Is it that the GNOME startup routine is waiting for a return
status which it's not getting cuz FVWM2 doesn't actually exit or something
silly like that? 

I'm just asking cuz it's become something of a curiosity to me. Is there
any workaround for this?
			-peace

Okay, it works now, great! ... almost *s*

I locatede the cursor.h file, found the cursor-styles and the different
"context" styles for CursorStyle (man), but the ROOT option isn't there
(as I thought). I tried with

  CursorStyle DEFAULT         132

... instead I use

  + "I" Exec xsetroot -cursor_name top_left_arrow (=132)

, which is working... its fine, but if could use a CursorStyle-command
then why not, no?

And last some installation questions: after installing Fvwm2 (2.2.4)
(how can I check that that is is infact 2.2.4 - "rpm -q" (?)) the
machine gets up in Afterstep - the rc.config says "fvwm2". I made the
"make install" as root, maybe that's why... still it is as if - all the
files are used from the "personal download library" and not from the
"machine-library" (/usr.. bin) the same goes for "doc" files... the
"packages/fvwm2/ dir. is empty, maybe I should take a look on the
Makefile, no?

Okay, thanks... its going the "rig*ht*" *s* way, nikolaj, copenhagen,
denmark.

I don't think anyone reading your question understands what you are asking.

Maybe you want to try again?

Add more information.

Hi,

Ok. Will explain better.
I would like to disable the keuyboard and mouse while the system is running.
The user shouldn't been able to hit a key neither move the mouse.

Just tried to chmod 0000 /dev/mouse but doesn't work .

is there a solution with xmodmap ??

Try xscreensaver.  This way, you can re-activate the keyboard and mouse with
the password.

You can set a Key link in .fvwm2rc to allow you to lock the screen just by
hitting a single key -like this
Key Scroll_Lock A       A       Function Sleep

Where Sleep is defined as:
AddToFunc Sleep                 "I" Exec exec
/usr/local/bin/xscreensaver-command -lock

With this, anytime you hit the scroll lock key (ScrLk) your keyboard and mouse
will do nothing but bring up a dialog for a password.

If this is what you are looking for, I hope it helps

If not, maybe a little more context might help.

If you are trying to run the system without keyboard or mouse input from boot,
you probably need to disable them from the BIOS.  But I don't see why you would
want to do this.

Lou

I understand your problem now.  Are you sure you don't have both a control and
meta key?  On my keyboard, the ALT key is the meta key.  On Sun keyboards, it is
the one with the little diamond.
But that isn't the problem.
I noticed you have the left, right, up, and down keys to scroll a whole page if
the control key is used, wether or not the numlock is down.  You also have them
set to scroll a page if the meta key is used, but not if the num lock is down.
If you duplicate the following lines:
Key Left        A       M       Scroll -100 0
Key Up          A       M       Scroll +0 -100
Key Right       A       M       Scroll +100 +0
Key Down        A       M       Scroll +0 +100

Like this:
Key Left        A       M3       Scroll -100 0
Key Up          A       M3       Scroll +0 -100
Key Right       A       M3       Scroll +100 +0
Key Down        A       M3       Scroll +0 +100

then you should have no problem.

As for the <CTRL>S - <CTRL>W problem in nedit, I'm afraid I can't explain it.
You might want to see if there is a newer version of nedit available, though
I doubt a bug that fundamental would make it to any release.
I don't know of any way to bind the CTRL key in any context, but if you do have
your CTRL and META keys switched, that might explain it.

Hope this helps.

How are you going to let the user regain control of the keyboard and mouse
if the user cannot press anything. Are you looking for a command that
locks things up until a certain period of time has elapsed or until a
password is entered or until an application starts? Which one?

rehi,

there's a program running in the background wich should manage this.
To allow the user to interact after happens something. This program is ready
and working, yet.
The only missing thing is to protect keyboard/ mouse against the user.

I use C++ to programm the things but also could do it by a shellscript if
theres a posibility or any other funny trick.

There ARE of course apps like xlock that displays an xscreensaver until
the correct password has been entered. But xlock requires X to be
running.

Otherwise you would have to use telnet or some other remote login to
issue whatever commands. The simplest answer would be to physically
remove the offending devices.  :)

You might want to try XGrabPointer and XGrabKeyboard.

Hi,

If it's a screensaver wich doesn't cover the Desktop or only a little area
of the screen.
I could shot it with a kill command after I would give the user access to
keyboard/mouse

but I think there are noones like this.

Actually, xscreensaver lets you use any program you would like as the
program that writes on the screen.  Including programs that don't write
on the screen.

There is one more solution, not using GotoPage or StartsOnPage.
Use the following or similar function to start your specific app.

AddToFunc StartNetscape
+ I Exec exec netscape
+ I Wait Netscape
+ I Next (Netscape) MoveToPage 0 1

This should solve your problem without switching pages. It's also possible
to use None and an additional function if you want even more complex logic.

Use:

  Style "XTerm" NoIconTitle

or:

  Style "*" NoIconTitle

Beware when using this style option, you may end up with no icon window
(similarly to using NoIcon) if icon pixmaps are not configured or not
compilled-in or misconfigured.

The name used in the icon is the one your application has supplied, you
should change the name (sometimes called "icon name") of the application:

  xterm -n "My Name"

Note, this is sometimes not the same as a title name (the one you see in
a window title), try: xterm -n "My Name" -T "My Title"

Because, like I said earlier in this thread, the ROOT cursor context was
introduced in 2.3.10 and you use 2.2.4.

If you installed fvwm from the sources, rpm can't say something correct.
If you installed from the rpm, try: 'rpm -qi fvwm2' (or without -i).

You can run 'fvwm2 -version' to determine the fvwm version.
In betas, also 'fvwm-config -v' or 'fvwm-config -i'.

Mikhael.

Buttons are numbered 1,3,5.. on the left side, 2,4,6.. on the right side.
First, you should define a button's look, just like it is done for your
buttons 1, 2 and 4, using vector graphics, pixmap, mini-icon or other
method, read about ButtonStyle in the man page. If you don't define a
button's look, the default look for that button will be used (dot,
rectangle or empty square), which may be not what you want.

Second, you should bind some Key or Mouse command to a newly defined
button, unbound buttons are not shown.

A working example:

ButtonStyle 3  7 70x15@0 30x55@1 50x55@0 40x85@1 80x45@0 60x45@1 70x15@0
Mouse 0  3  A  WindowShade

Mikhael.

Hi there,

I have installed the FVWM in my home directory and want to launch it using
Exceed version 5.1.3.0. 

I have also created a .xinitrc in home directory with the following content:
=============
#! /bin/csh -f
# .xinitrc
#
# REVISIONS:
###########################################################################


fvwm2 &
===========

Any help is very much appreciated.

Thanks

  the way I do it:

  don't include anything on the unix side,

  on windows NT side do the following

  configure exceed like this:

  in configuration, screen definition:
    window mode: single
    root size: full screen

  create Xstart for fvwm, I use following command line:

/export/home/users/esteffl/local/bin/fvwm2 -display @d &

  (exceeds replaces @d by its display (=you workstation ip + ':.0.0')

  create Xsession
  include above Xstart in Xsession,

  you can create more Xstart files for otgher clients that you want to
start and include them in Xsession...

  start exceed by running the created x session (that's not fundamental
for fvwm usage, I just find it convenient)

Hi,

first of all I have to say Thnaks for the active discussion of the =
desktop security by blocking mouse or keyboard.
Now solved it on another way by my running programm wich doesn't react =
to users keystrokes until there is "permission".

the .fvwm2rc file could by different for every user, e.g. =
/home/user/.fvwm2rc ??? or are the settings global?

a style specified for a Windowname and all of his childs works like:

Style "myapp" something,....
Style "myapp-2" something,..
Style "myapp-3" something,...

where myapp-2/3 are the childs from myapp ???


Thanks

Which variable in the fvwm2 rc file is responsible for setting the
window background color?
Every time a new xterm window pops up , it uses white which hurts a bit
my eyes. Searching the fvwm rc file and replacing every white with
"LightSteelBlue" didn't help. This makes me think that fvwm might not be
resposible for this attribute - would someone kindly help?

Which version of fvwm do you use?
I've exactly the same problem with the current cvs (I also try
2.3.19). On the other hand, I have not this problem with
2.3.10 (will try an intermediate version soon).

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.21 compiled on Jul  6 2000 at 15:06:22
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  ReadLine XPM IMLIB Gnome Session

That's the last version I compiled up, but I've had that problem for a
rather long time now.

I am having a problem getting modules to load properly using fvwm2 v2.2.4.  This
may be related to how fvwm2 was installed.

fvwm2 is in /usr/local/bin and the modules are in /usr/local/fvwm-2.2.4/modules.
However, each module is in its own directory, e.g. FvwmPager is in
/usr/local/fvwm-2.2.4/modules/FvwmPager.  The ModulePath in .fvwm2rc is
/usr/local/fvwm-2.2.4/modules.  When I start fvwm2 it gives a "cannot execute"
error for each module.  If I change ModulePath to
/usr/local/fvwm-2.2.4/modules/FvwmPager:/usr/local/fvwm-2.2.4/modules/FvwmAuto
then it works.  If this is correct, it is a change from 2.0.46, which we were
using.

I suspect that something went awry in installation, but don't know what.  I
would have expected the module executables to have been moved from the
module-name directories to ../modules, but that apparently didn't happen.

Thanks,

You are looking at the modules  in the directories  they are built in.
Do a "make install" and look at the output  for any one of the modules
to see which directory they get installed in.  The all get installed in
one directory.

Thanks to all being so helpful.
Accidently I sent this message yesterday directly to Eric, sorry about
that - I'm struggling with the IMAP mailserver who sometimes refuses
accessing the mail and completely confuses me.

The entry:

"xterm*background:               LightSteelBlue" 

in .Xdefaults did exactly what it should.
Unfortunatly my system doesn't provide a man page for .Xdefaults. Which
man page would contain simular informations? I guess these commands are
used throughout the X-system, am I right with this?

Netscape mail composer (not the html composer) seems to retrieve the
color settings out of another file than preferences.js. In this file all
background is set to lightgrey, contrary the mail composer displays the
background in white.

Additionally - where can I retrieve all system colors in words? Those
like "Steelblue" etc can be found in some sample files, but I would like
to have look at the whole listing. (I'm using 16bit depth)

Typically: /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt

It should be mentioned in your XF86Config file:
[ /etc/X11/XF86Config, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config /etc/XF86Config
  it depends on your system ]

Emacs may have its own rgb.txt, but it only uses it on MS systems

'locate rgb.txt' should tell you where it is, assuming updatedb has been
run at some point. You should run updatedb regularly. updatedb and locate
are your friends :)

Hi!

> How do disable these services provided by X11 ???

=46rom the XF86Config (Version 4.0) manpage:

 Option "DontZap"  "boolean"
              This  disallows  the  use of the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
              sequence.  That sequence is normally used to termi=AD
              nate  the  X  server.  When this option is enabled,
              that key sequence has no  special  meaning  and  is
              passed to clients.  Default: off.




 Option "VTSysReq"  "boolean"
              enables the SYSV-style VT switch sequence for  non-
              SYSV  systems  which  support  VT  switching.  This
              sequence is Alt-SysRq followed by  a  function  key
              (Fn).  This prevents the X server trapping the keys
              used for the  default  VT  switch  sequence,  which
              means  that clients can access them.  Default: off.


Wen using older XFree look at the section about Serverflags. The keyword
are the same.

Hi guys,

    Do you know where can I find a fairly big selection of xpm icons?
I already have a lot but I beleive with as many as window managers
there should be a lot of icons. I found some beautifull neon icons but
few of them. I would appreciate it if someone can help me find some
more.

Thanks

I found this file - and puh, what a amount of colors!
The only file mentioned in  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg or
/etc/X11/XF86Config is rgb (not the txt version)

"locate" is indeed my best friend, wouldn't know what to do without this tool.


How do I set other parameters like a smaller window width on a Xterm startup? -
the XF86Config file doesn't seem to control that. I looked at the fvwm2 config
files and searched for everything containing a "width" or a "height" but found
nothing responsable for these settings.

Additionally I replaced twm with fvwm2 in the VNC ~/xstartup script and
everytime now VNC is launched with "vncserver" on the terminal before starting
X11,  the program parsing the fvwm2 configuration file seems to go into a
endless loop and I have to Crtl+c to get a prompt again.

Would be awful nice if someone would help with this.

Robert,

To start xterm with a different geometry, use xterm -geometry +50+50x40x80

The +50+50 tells it where to start on your window manager and the x40x80
tells it what size to be.

Most options specific to a programs settings are controlled by the
individual program.  You can use "xterm -h" or "xterm -" or, of course,
"man xterm" to see those options.

If you just want to control the xterms started from menus, you should
change your WM config, but I'm guessing you knew that: typically this sort
of thing is controlled by x resources: [see man xrdb]
 
typically you want a command something like 

xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

somewhere in your startup. [Xresources are [I believe] a property of the
X display itself, so xrdb must have access to a valid display to work:
this is automatically Ok in x clients and .xinitrc/.xsession]

Here's a selection from my .Xresources file: [! introduces a comment]
Netscape*fileSelector.pattern:  *
YTalk.reverse:  true
YTalk.font:     7x14
Xless*customization: -color
Xless*sizeToFit: true
vt100*activeIcon:       TRUE
xterm*activeIcon:       TRUE
xterm*colorBDMode:      FALSE
xterm*colorBLMode:      FALSE
xterm*colorULMode:      FALSE
!Emacs*pane.menubar.background: #000000
!Emacs*pane.menubar.foreground: #0088aa

The man page for each particular app should explain what resources the app
understands. I think you want 

xterm*geometry: 80x25

or similar

Well, you're referring to the window geometry. Look at the manpage for
xterm. There are standard toolkit options that most programs accept,
such as -bg, -fg and -geometry. A useful book is O'Reilly's X Window
System in a Nutshell.

  the way I do it:

  don't include anything on the unix side,

  on windows NT side do the following

  configure exceed like this:

  in configuration, screen definition:
    window mode: single
    root size: full screen

  create Xstart for fvwm, I use following command line:

/export/home/users/esteffl/local/bin/fvwm2 -display @d &

  (exceeds replaces @d by its display (=you workstation ip + ':.0.0')

  create Xsession
  include above Xstart in Xsession,

  you can create more Xstart files for otgher clients that you want to
start and include them in Xsession...

  start exceed by running the created x session (that's not fundamental
for fvwm usage, I just find it convenient)

  you need to set the ManPath in your .fvwm2rc to point to where the
modules are (or don't use modules).

  if you're at loss as to where the modules are, try:

  locate FvwmAuto

  if that does not help, try (it will probably take long time (few
minutes)):

  find / -name FvwmAuto -print > find.log
  cat find.log

Looks OK, but I don't think you need the trailing ampersand.

In my experience, you get this when Exceed never sees the prompt string
that it waits for after running your profile.  (Assuming you are using the
"rlogin" method of connection.

However, since it ran your command, I think it did see the prompt string.

> > stty: : Invalid argument

Something in your profile attempted to execute the "stty" comamnd.
It should only do this when the shell is interactive.  Like this:

case $- in
*i*)    #interactive shell
  stty ...
esac

Look for a syntax error in your .fvwm2rc containing ClickToFocus.

These are related to your ModulePath.

Looks OK, but I don't think you need the trailing ampersand.

In my experience, you get this when Exceed never sees the prompt string
that it waits for after running your profile.  (Assuming you are using the
"rlogin" method of connection.

However, since it ran your command, I think it did see the prompt string.

> > stty: : Invalid argument

Something in your profile attempted to execute the "stty" comamnd.
It should only do this when the shell is interactive.  Like this:

case $- in
*i*)    #interactive shell
  stty ...
esac

Look for a syntax error in your .fvwm2rc containing ClickToFocus.

These are related to your ModulePath.

These are the wrong directories.  This is the area the build takes place
in.

Do a "make install" and look at where the modules are installed.

This is exactly the problem.  ModulePath should be (for the basic
installation) a path to a directory in which all of the fvwm modules have
been installed.

I'd suggest that you do the following to save yourself some headaches.  It
appears that you built this in your home directory.  I'd suggest that you
re-compile, this time using the -prefix option to the configure step.
It's explained in the README or INSTALLATION notes; I can't remember
which.  Don't forget to remove the previous configure log.  Then do a make
all and make install.  This will build all of the modules in their
respective directories, which is what you are listing below, and the make
install will move the executeables to the directory that you specify with
the -prefix compile option.

If I remember right if you set prefix to your home directory then
configure will create the directory ~/libexex/fvwm/2.2.4/ and put the
modules there.  Set ModulePath to that directory and you're set.

  note that those are directories, not the actual modules (the modules
are files). you have to put the actual modules somewhere and point the
ModulePath to that 'somewhere'

  generally, to avoid this kind of troubles, I created local directory
under my home directory and install all the programs there, using:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
make
make install

  that does the proper installation, I just added ~/local/bin to my PATH
(+ some other minor stuff like MANPATH etc.), here's relevant part of
.tcshrc

setenv PATH ${HOME}/local/bin:/other/stuff
setenv MANPATH ${HOME}/local/man:/other/stuff
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /other/stuff:${HOME}/local/lib

  above works for csh derivatives, if you use sh/bash/ksh/...:

export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:/other/stuff
export MANPATH=${HOME}/local/man:/other/stuff
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/other/stuff:${HOME}/local/lib

  there might be some errors in above but I guess you get the idea...

I have been using FVWM and FVWM2 for a very long time.

Is FVWM2 a GNOME compliant window manager?
Can GNOME applications and applets be used with the FVWM2 window manager?

I am trying to avoid switching to a different window manager.

Any information appreciated. Thank you in advance.

The latest betas are Gnome compliant.

Thanks for replying. I am trying to configure FVWM2 with GTK and GNOME with the following
configure options,

(0)root@myhost:~/src/fvwm-2.3.20 => ./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --exec-prefix=/usr/X11R6
--with-xpm-library=/usr/X11R6/lib --with-xpm-includes=/usr/include/X11 --enable-dmalloc
--enable-debug-msgs --with-x --with-gtk-prefix=/usr --with-gtk-exec-prefix=/usr --with-gnome=/usr/bin
--with-gnome-libs=/usr/lib --with-gnome-includes=/usr/include

At the end of the configure script, I get the following output,

  FVWM Version:                      2.3.20

  Have ReadLine support?             yes
  Have RPlay support?                no

Why is GNOME Window Manager support being set to "no"?
Do the --with-gnome* options require a path? The configure script "--help" option does not
seem to indicate that requirement. If so, then how do I determine the GNOME libs path and
includes path?

Thank you in advance for any help.

--with-gnome=/somewhere  is to look for gnome includes and libs, used in
FvwmGtk (if available) I think...

Thanks for the help. I missed the --enable-gnome option. It works fine now.

Hmmm...
I always launch vncserver from an Eterm (after I've started X).
My vncserver xstartup file reads like this:

[tenebrae@pointy .vnc]$ cat xstartup
#!/bin/sh

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -bg black -fg LightGrey -ls -title
"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
fvwm2

I've never had a problem with it, except trying to figure out how to get
my starting xterm to have reverse video enabled!  I finally gave up and
just set the background and foreground colours.
I also dunno what the xrdb $HOME/.Xresources line is for (I can't find one
anywhere).  Oh well...at least it works.

Hello,

I just got done compiling and installing FVWM2 2.3.20. The module
path is /usr/X11R6/libexec/fvwm/2.3.20/ . In the past (2.2.x and before)
the FVWM had a configuration file in $HOME, either (.fvwmrc or .fvwm2rc).
The new installation does not seem to be using the file I originally had,
i.e. $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

1. Where is the FVWM2 reading the configuration file from?

2. Why does FVWM does not start from XDM but works fine from GDM?

The "fvwm2" binary is installed in /usr/X11R6/bin. My distro is Slackware 7.1.

I think if you look at the man page for fvwm2 you will find that it reads
it from ~/.fvwm/ unless you set some environment variable.

I really can't help you here.  At least with 2.2.4 I know that it works
from both XDM and GDM.  I haven't tried XDM lately.  

>The "fvwm2" binary is installed in /usr/X11R6/bin. My distro is Slackware 7.1.

At least with the RH6.1 setp gdm calls the same script as xdm on start-up,
so I can't see why it wouldn't behave the same for me.  I don't know
Slackware...

In the pre-2.3.21 (the current cvs) the default here is "yes", no need
to specify --enable-gnome.

Is www.fvwm.org server down? There is no response from this server or
IP address.

Is there a mirror to this site?

Thanks in advance.

I am using the FVWM2 version 2.3.20 and compiled with the GNOME libs enabled.
The GNOME apps startup fine. In an xterm, when I started asclock_applet, I got
the following warning messages,

I don't know if there is a development list to which I could have posted.
The GNOME applet started fine. Is there anyone in particular in the development
team, I should send this type of information?

No, it's up, but our campus is having some network trouble and so outside
connexions may be slow or impossible to achieve right now.

Patience is a virtue.

Thanks for all helping me.

One main thing I learned now was that programs define their window parameters in
their own conf files.
Xterm however really confuses me, of course I can start xterm with the "-geometry"
option and I did so in the popupmenu file fvwm2 uses - but contrary to  the color
option I placed in the ~/Xdefaults file, the geometry option was not noticed (didn't
even cause an error).

There's one file which looks like a configuration file which I'm rather hesitating to
edit, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xterm.terminfo. The settings there are looking quite
cryptic. Anyone familiar with this file?

Unfortunatly my system seems only to use the ~/.Xdefaults file, no Xresources file in
any home directory. As far as I have understood "man xrdb" correctly (there's one
nice URL http://www.tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/resource-manager/), thanks to Richard for
providing the really helpful URL http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html , Xresources
is only optional and extends rather Xdefaults.

When fvwm2 loads , it places two xterms right at the beginning which have a different
size than just launching a xterm by command. The only line which could be responsable
seems to be in system.fvwm2rc.m4-2:

# RLOGIN machine fg bg
AddToFunc RLOGIN "I" Exec xterm -fg $1 -bg $2 -e rlogin $0 -8
- but no size parameters used there ...


Any further help would be nice

The endless loop vaneshed after launching X11 and then starting
vncserver (your suggestion), I'm woundering why?
There's one difference between your vnc startup script and mine - I've
got a "&" as the terminating character after fvwm2, therefor:
"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" & fvwm2 &

I'm not quite happy having to launch X11 to use the vncserver because my
intention is to use the server without a monitor and launching X11 for
nothing would take some system resources which I would rather like to
use for applications.
But -oops - I just realized I can't start any x-apps (netscape, xemacs)
without starting x11 ( I thought vnc uses x11 libs and provides these
libs to all other apps because I have a fvwm2 desktop with just starting
vncserver from a terminal and no x11 running currently on the entire
linux server)
Actually this is the big difference:
Removing the terminating "&"  in ""$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" & fvwm2 &"
causes vncserver to launch without running the system into a endless
loop which I mentioned in the previous message.

What exactly is " reverse video" ?
Additionally - how do I kill a vncserver ? The html help provides
"vncserver -kill :<serverinstancenumber>"
If I do that - the appropiate server instance does not die - instead a
new server instance is created!

Hello. I recently upgraded to Red Hat 6.2 which comes with the gnome.
I take the opportunity to ask the following question:

What are the benefits of enabling gnome support in fvwm2 from the
standpoint of an fvwm2 user? What does gnome do for fvwm2?

Thanks,

Neil

A Gnome-enabled fvwm2 plays along nicer with Gnome.. Tasklist, pager,
panel etc working much better.

Ye who are experienced in FVWM,

I am just geting going and have two questions.  

1. I would like to have a key (Alt-Tab or F2) cycle through all the windows.

These commands seem to access a linear list, but not a ring.

Key F2 A N Next (!Iconic CirculateHit) Focus
Key Tab A M Next (CurrentDesk) Focus
Key Tab A SM Prev (CurrentDesk) Focus

In other words, I would like to continue to loop around among all the
windows with one key without having to change directions.  Is this possible?

2. Are the configurations for the nice screen shots on
http://fvwm.org/screenshots/index.html available anywhere.   I am especially
interested in Dominik Vogt's near Windows95 setup.

Thank you!

It's possible your xinitrc file is starting those other xterms.  xinitrc
is where I place all of my commands for starting programs at X
startup.  The default location on slackware is: 
/var/X11R6/lib/xinit/xinitrc

check for a .xinitrc in your home directory too.

My ~/.xinitrc merely contains the line, "fvwm2".  That's all.  Nothing
else.
Oh, duh.  Silly me.
I found where to set reverse video.  I was doing it right, but I forgot to
capitalize the T in XTerm!  Picky, picky, picky...

The current betas are 2.2 compatible, so .fvwm2rc or system.fvwm2rc are
searched in the same places, but also in ~/.fvwm. If you still feel your
$HOME/.fvwm2rc is not read, supply more info (any error messages?).

We are speaking about the GNOME Window Manager hints support in fvwm.
Like with any other optional support, there are only benefits if you plan
to use GNOME specific applications or environment.

Example 1: If you run gnome panel inside fvwm without GNOME support, you
can't fully use GNOME pager applets (if at all); with such support you can
see right pages/desks and move windows between them inside GNOME pagers.
You can also use Tasklist applet and manage your windows using it.

Example 2: If you run gmc and bind GnomeButton (see the man page), you can
pass root clicks to a gnome application (i.e. to gmc in this case).

Example 3: You can run fvwm inside gnome-session, i.e. define fvwm to be
a GNOME Window Manager. This feature is more about a session management
support rather than the GNOME hints support.

If you really wonder what GNOME WM hints are, contact GNOME documentation.

Regards,
Mikhael.

These messages can't be related to fvwm.
You can get Gtk-WARNING's caused by fvwm only if you use FvwmGtk module.

These are only warnings, so you can ignore them, or redirect to /dev/null,
probably you can report your findings to GTK+ developement mailing lists.

Most of these screenshots are done for 2.3 configurations.
If you use the latest betas, just (re)move your .fvwm2rc and choose from
the root menu "Setup 95 Script" to configure Windows95-like setup.
Read the top and bottom of system.fvwm2rc-sample-95 if you need more info.

Found it - fixed it.
Now I'm quite happy with the new settings at X11 startup, but this drives me mad:
When calling a new xterm within a existing xterm - I get the old big (and unwanted) xterm
as before. I thought grepping "xterm" all files in /etc would help - but it didn't. There's

Something OT - but quite a general question. I'm having problems using dos_emu. The wine NG
recommendened to subscribe to linux-msdos-digest which would be the appropiate maillist.
The subscription succeeded, but I didn't recieve one mail after one passing week neither
could I access the mailist by writing a message.
Anyone knowing which maillist supports dos_emu - please send me a short note

Thank you very much

Try

XTerm*Geometry:  80x24+0+0

I think you can also drop the coordinates and simply do

XTerm*Geometry:  80x24

and let the window manager place the window.

in ~/.Xdefaults

Do a find for Xclients or .Xclients. You may have one in ~ or in
somewhere like /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients. Actually, your best bet
is to poke around in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 or similar and figure out
what scripts do what. Tell me your OS and whether you run xdm or
xinit or startx and I can probably give you more direct help.

Most X apps use geometry to set size in pixels. Xterm does it
in characters, so the following:

  XTerm.vt100.geometry:           80x48

sets an xterm 80 chars wide and 48 high. It should change size if
it changes font.

The vt100 widget is the one where the text appears. Xterm also does
tektronix emulation but noone uses that anymore. The widgets for
menus are vtMenu, fontMenu and mainMenu.

Thomas, this didn't work (reported a few messages ago), color settings work fine in Xdefauts, the geometry options
are somehow not noticed or maybe another script overrides them.
Richards assumption was to look at the /usr/X11R6 directories, I'll grep there.

Only a sample.Xclients file on the hdd. The distribution I'm using didn't configure this kind of file to the system.
You asked for the distr.:
It is a 2.0.35 distribution from "DLD", in the meantime bought by RedHat. After reading some magazines I get the
impression that this distribution is quite nearby to the old 5.x RedHat distr. The configuration files and scripts
are quite like the ones used by RedHat.

This is one thing I would like to ask you. The system is set to runlevel 3. When logging as root I start X11 on the
commandline via "startx". Contrary when logging in as a user I get a messagebox in a VGA screen"Would you like To
start the X11 system?" followed by yes/no buttons  - althought the entries in /etc/inittab explictly require runlevel
3!
I therefor cannot judge by what X11 is started. Which files can be responsable for this behaviour?

Grepping all files in /usr/XLLR6 for "xterm" gave a vast amount of files.
- But I would like to remind of the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xterm.terminfo.  Would you concern, would you like to
have a look at this file?

There's one thing which I would really like to solve, how do I know in which order all those scripts are loaded - is
there a file which lists like /var/log/messages ?




I wouldn't like to bother the people here in this newsgroup with a topic that is only near to fvwm and doesn't
concern fvwm directly - so please let me know - Richard - would you like to handle this via email?

Thanks for your patience


Robert

Subject: FVWM: problems with 'Resize' command

Hello,

   I'm running FVWM-2.3.21 under RedHat Linux 6.0.

   I have some slight problems with the 'Resize' command.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I'm attempting to resize a terminal window (xterm or rxvt)
   by a single character, by moving its bottom right corner.

   The two commands:

      Resize bottomright w+1c keep

      Resize bottomright keep w-1c

   both work correctly, making the window one character wider
   and one character shallower, respectively.

   However, the command:

      Resize bottomright w-1c keep

   makes the window *two* characters narrower, rather than just one.
   Furthermore, the command:

      Resize bottomright keep w+1c

   has no effect on the window, instead of making it one character deeper.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Some other problems arise when attempting to resize windows created by
   "pixel-oriented" programs such as xdvi, gv, or ee (Electric Eyes).

   In these cases:

      Resize bottomright w+1c keep  makes the window 10 pixels wider
      Resize bottomright w-1c keep  makes the window 11 pixels narrower
      Resize bottomright keep w+1c  makes the window  7 pixels deeper
      Resize bottomright keep w-1c  makes the window  8 pixels shallower

   From the FVWM documentation, I would have expected that here, '1c'
   should mean 1 pixel.  Or at any rate, that all four resize commands
   should change the window size by the same amount in each case.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I wonder if my understanding of what's supposed to happen is incorrect,
   or if there's a bug in the code for resizing?

   I would be grateful if one of the developers could take a look at this.

Thanks! -- Joseph

I don't think this is what you're looking for.  Just a wild shot, check
the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm or anything like it for
geometry information.

Tom - great shot!
Bull's eye   :^)

This file contained a statement from the distributer, he even used the word "override" and therefore easy to locate.


Thanks!

This is not correct. :)
If you read the man page, it says that bottomright accepts the same x & y
parameters as Move does, and Move does not support 'c' suffix, maybe it
will support later, but not now. So, w+1c is just w+1; try w+1p.

This is half way incorrect too. :)
X and Y increments are independent, for example 'Resize 1c 1c' for xterm
with 7x14 font is equivalent to 'Resize 7p 14p'. And the actual X and Y
values in 'Resize 1 1' or 'Move 1 1' are usually in 4/3 or 5/4 proportion.

But you are right that the following two commands do not restore the
original positions (due to float/int rounding errors, may be fixed):

  Move w+1 w+1
  Move w-1 w-1

Thank you for your report.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I also found out the hard way that turning off my monitor before I left
kinda made it impossible to use vncserver...heh.  Oops.

Okay, when vncserver starts, it politely launches an xterm for me (my
usual Eterms do NOT work well under vnc).  It uses my cursor preference of
purple, but it makes the background off-white and the text black.  I'd
rather have the background black and the text off-white.  Or light
grey.  When I'm sitting at my computer, I can hit ctrl-middlemousebutton
and it will pop up a list of VT options (one of which is reverse
video).  Selecting this will conveniently switch the foreground and the
background colours.  I wanted to find a way to enable it by default when
an xterm is launched (I finally did - yay - the XTerm statement was
case-sensitive...).

That's odd.  When I launch vncserver (telnet into server from work, type
in vncserver &), it usually creates server instance 1.  To kill it, I
telnet back into the server and type in "vncserver -kill :1" and that
works for me...if it doesn't work from you try going into your ~/.vnc and
find the PIDs of the other sessions, kill them manually, and remove all
associated files.  There's another file off in another directory that I
can't remember that it creates...mind like a steel sieve.

(I also hate it when I postpone an e-mail message and then forget to
resume it...heh)

Hi,

How can I know what is missing? I hope you can help me out with that.

In general Solaris video cards are only capable of supporting 256 colors
at 1280x1024 resolution.

This is a hardware limitation on Solaris, and nothing to do with FVWM.

Look at the ColorLimit command in the man page.

Always start Netscape with the "-install" switch.

hi there

one of my users had num lock on today and the window manager seemed to
be disregarding all keyboard input and mouse button input...

is there something special that i have to put into my fvwm2rc file to
make sure that the root mouse menus work even when numlock is on?

think of the numlock as an alt key.  It is a modifier.  And most of the
sequences are specific to a set of modifiers with the numlock off.

If you wish to have the same behavior with and without the numlock, then
simply duplicate all keybindings and have the 2nd set react when the nulock is
set.

Well, I thought the FAQ had the last word on numlock, perhaps not.

The man page touches on this, but it could be clearer.

Do:

  xmodmap -pm

For me, (under Exceed), I get:

me> xmodmap -pm
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x31),  Shift_R (0x3d)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x41)
control     Control_L (0x24),  Control_R (0x5e)
mod1        Alt_L (0x3f),  Alt_R (0x61)
mod2      
mod3        Num_Lock (0x62)
mod4      
mod5      

So, in this case, the fvwm modifier for numlock is "3".

Num lock is a modifer. xmodmap will tell you which one, eg:

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

You can `xmodmap -e 'clear Mod2'`, but that will disable num lock, or you
can duplicate all your key/mouse bindings with and without Mod2 (tedious).
I believe the latest betas have an IgnoreModifier thingy you can also use.

Some programs start w/ their title bar off the top of the screen.
I assume fvwm's getting confused about where 0,0 is. for the window.

Is there a way i can tell fvwm that if i window goes above the screen, to
push it back down....preferably generically?

I get the same behaviour with an older version of fvwm.  I don't think
it's confused about where 0,0 is because you can grab the window, not
move it at all and let go and the window will snap to 0,0 on it's own.
Also, if you move it around and then move back so the little window
position indicator shows 0,0, then it does end up where it should.  

It only happens when a new window opens.

Which applications behave this way, how is it possible to reproduce?

Did you play with NoPPosition/UsePPosition style options?

In version 2.0.46, when you resized a window, FVWM used to display
the size of the window in the center of the screen.  Moving a
window would display the location.

Version 2.2.4, at least the version in Debian Linux 2.2, does not
do that by default.

What option do I set to turn that back on?

Thanks,

Daniel

I recently bought a Lucky Goldstar Flatron 797FT Plus monitor (17"), and
I thought I should be able to get a better performance from this monitor
than I actually do. I compared it in the shop with a IIlama 17", and I
thought the LG performed better on a MS Win machine than the IIlama.
However, at home I get coloured bands over the screen (interference, I
think), and I'd like to fine-tune it better. But someone else, who is
handier with that than I am, might have done this already. Yet I have
not found example specifications for this monitor. Would they be unavai-
lable at all, or could you give a hint how to find them? 

Thanks

Hi all,
I am using fvwm 2.3.20
Is it possible to pass to fvwm the command line used to start the
process hosted in each window?
I would like to bind a window button to different actions, depending on the 
process being displayed
E.g.  if the the file fname has been opened by the command 'gvim fname'
      one of the window buttons on the title bar will open my tricks&tips
      notes about gvim and another one will open my notes about the
      contents of fname.

How can i do?

thank you for your help

I've been using FVWM for ages and it's always worked for me just
fine.  However, I've started using Rational Rose for Solaris.  FVWM
seems to get completely confused.

o FVWM doesn't draw any frames around the Rose window like it does for
  all other windows (except for those I explicit said not to).

o The Rose window is always on top.  Nothing I do can bring another
  window above the Rose window.

o Using FVWM's identify window module shows nothing.  No identify
  window pops up showing the window info.

o Focus sometimes seems to be lost.  (I have focus follows mouse).  I
  have to move the mouse out of the window and back in to get focus.
  Sometimes I also have to click in the window to get focus.

The annoying thing is that this all seems to work with CDE and dtwm.
I don't want to have to switch to dtwm so any hints or pointers on
where to look to get FVWM to understand this window would help me a
lot.

Thanks,

Ray

P.S.  Here is what xwininfo has to say about the Rose window.  The
Rose window looks just like a Windows 95 window with it's buttons and
stuff.

This hint tells the window manager to ignore the window.
Since that hint is set, I think all the behaviors you describe are
correct.

Hmm, this is weird.  When I run it under dtwm, xwininfo says Override
Redirect State: no.  I wonder how rose knows how to set this?  Can
rose figure out what window manager is running?  Note that I start
dtwm and fvwm both via startx.  The only difference is that I set
USE_CDE=yes to choose dtwm instead of fvwm

Is there a way to tell FVWM to ignore this hint for a window anyway?

I don't want to use dtwm, so any hints on getting this to work with
FVWM would be most appreciated.  (I'm too lazy to switch, and I like
fvwm.) 

Thanks,

Ray

i want to create a function called RaiseLower that would do the
following...

on a mouse click in the window title bar...

test the window in which the click was received to see if it is at the
top of the window stacking order...

if so, lower the window
if not, raise the window

any suggestions on how to do this?

Hi!

There's a little problem I can't solve myself.

When starting my FVWM-session (fvwm2), I'm generating my fvwmrc. As I
want to use the same configuration-files on different architectures
(Linux and Solaris mixed on Suns, PCs and IBM PowerPCs), I need to
generate them while starting my X. The graphics are completely mixed up,
so there's no way of guessing geometry or depth by CPU or OS. Builing a
list of all computers is no way of solving my problem, as there are too
many and new ones are often being baught.

I need # of bitplanes, height, width, OS, CPU and name of the system.
>From those, I build my rc. Offcourse, it's a nice thing on a fast
machine. But, as You may guess, on rather slow machines or lot's of
traffic on the nfs-server, FVWM is up before the rc has been finished.
Well, all modules, like FvwmM4, are being spawned.

Writing a xinitrc would include writing X-Tools for reading the display.
I don't want that, because that would mean five different binaries. And
will it be easy? I don't know any X.

What I'm doing at this time:

my .fvwmrc starts FvwmM4 and reads the file, I generate.

Generating a file means doing some nasty M4-things and reading my
definition-files. Out comes the main rc for this session.

This way, there's no problem when restarting. BTW: That's what I need to
do to read the new rc, except I logged in on the same architecture
before.

So. Can any cool reader help me? I know, it is not trivial. But there
has to be a way to solve it, has it?


Thanks in advance! Even if it's just a "No ***** way, man!"

i.e. the function is built into fvwm

I don't need a function to to this, RaiseLower is a built-in command, at
least in my version 2.3.x. This is the binding for the right mouse
button.

Mouse 3        T    A       RaiseLower


Hope it helps,

I think this is not an fvwm2 question, more something for the X-server.
Try to find more info in the docs from your X-server.

In case you use XFree and RedHat, you might find info in
/usr/lib/X11/doc/, I don't know it for other distro's or servers.

Hope it helps,

I would like to change my maximize button depending on whether a
window is maximized or not (a bit like in CDE). How can I do
this?

Regards
Martin

I don't think I fully understand your question.

Every window (son or uncle) has its own name, resource name and class.
All three names can be used for the first parameter of the Style command.
To determine the window names, execute FvwmIdent on the window.
For example, press Shift-Mouse3 on the window title after the binding:

  Mouse 3 T S FvwmIdent

In case some windows have similar names, you can use a patern, like:

  Style "myapp*" StyleOption1, StyleOption2...

No, this is not possible with fvwm as of now.

This can be done using a window name.
Fortunately for you, gvim sets its name to "VIM - fname"

So, this should do the work (Ctrl-Mouse3 on the titlebar button 1 here):

  Mouse 3 1 C MyGvimExclusiveAction

  AddToFunc MyGvimExclusiveAction
  + WindowId $w ("VIM - fname.txt") Exec exec open-my-notes-about fname.txt
or:
  + WindowId $w ("VIM - *") Exec exec open-my-notes-about "$n"

where open-my-notes-about is your shell script, which gets the file name
or the gvim title (it should parse it, s/^VIM - //, to get the file name).

I hope, you get an idea.

If you want to have different number of titlebar buttons, you should use
FvwmEvent (see archives how) to catch VIM window and bind more buttons.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Probably your application can know about dtwm running by USE_CDE or other
dtwm-documented methods (X Atoms?).

No, fvwm simply is not notified by X Server about such windows.
Some info in: http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9903/msg00958.html

You can use "BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged on" in the betas to improve the
situation, but the real solution is to ask the app authors to fix it.

Here are 3 ways to solve synchronization problems.

If you need an external script (not FvwmM4) to generate fvwmrc, just run
it (without ampersand) before fvwm. Utilities like `uname` and `xwininfo
-root` together with `sed` should provide the needed constants.

If you want your full configuration to be processed by FvwmM4, run
fvwm as: fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.m4"

In the 2.3 versions you can call FvwmM4 to process the variable parts
synchronously: ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 -lock menus.m4

I hope this helps, sorry if I don't understand your problem.

Mikhael.

No, this is not possible as of now. It is possible somewhat to configure a
separator line (see SeparatorsShort, TitleUnderlines2 in the man page).
