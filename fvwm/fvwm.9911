Only very few kilobytes (if at all).  Most of these options will be gone
with the 2.4 release.  I guess the best way to save even more memory is
to use an old release with a smaller binary.  I'd try one of thr 1.24x
releases.  If flexibility is not the thing you want the best place to
save memory is the size of the executable.

It *does*.  If it didn't it would be completely useless.  The man page
says:

  The optional parameter \fIrecreate\fP tells fvwm not to throw away
  the menu completely but to throw away all the menu items (including
  the title).

I hope it's clear that the 'Dynamic...Action' is *not* a menu item
since it doesn't appear in the menu.

I have never used 1.xx myself, so I'm not sure if it will work
(1.xx is ancient history and has not been supported anymore for
several years).  With any of the 2.x.y version you should be able
to write a function to accopmplish what you want:

  AddToFunc RunAndMaximize
  + I Exec exec $1
  + I Wait $2
  + I Current Maximize

Now, if you want to start a maximized xterm, you would call the
function like this:

  Function RunAndMaximize xterm <title>
                          ^^^^^ 
                            command name

Where <title> is the title of the new window.

What the function does is:

  - it starts the application
  - waits for a window with the given <title> to appear
  - maximizes the currently focused window

Note that this only works if the newly created window gets
the focus.  Otherwise you might want to try

  + I Next ($2) Maximize

instead of 'Current'.

GNOME support is the thing we want :-) does 1.24x support it ?

You want _GNOME_ support but you want to save a couple of K of memory in
the window manager?

I think you have your priorities mixed up for memory savings! :)

Anyway, no, 1.x doesn't support GNOME.  The last version of 1.x was
released before the first Linux distro even existed, and it hasn't been
supported in that long.

If you want GNOME support you have to wait for 2.4 to be released.  If
you want, you can use one of the betas or a CVS daily snapshot.  They're
pretty stable, generally.  See the Downloads page of http://www.fvwm.org.

Gnome support is only in the fvwm2 beta releases.

Hi, 

I used to use the FvwmpagerPixmap option in my .fvwm2rc file.
By choosing the same pixmap as the root window background pixmap, 
the pager could be made to appear transparant. Today, I downloaded
the new stable release of fvwm2, and now the pixmap didn't appear
in the pager. Looking at the man page, this option seems to 
have been removed from FvwmPager. Is it still possible to put 
pixmaps in the pager, or do I have to be content with a plain color
background?

regards,

Jos van Riswick

Jos, The option for the pixmap seems to work for me with current CVS
code.  Could you tell me exactlly what your Pager config is, also
verify that the pixmap is being found I use the full path in my config
otherwise you need to set IconPath and PixmapPath in fvwm 2.2.x or
ImagePath in 2.3.x

If all else fails send me your Pager config, version number of fvwm and
the pixmap

Hi Brad,

Thanks for the quick response. In my .fvwm2rc I use the following
statements to configure the pager: 



*FvwmPagerFont "none"
*FvwmPagerPixmap /root/icons/bg.xpm
*FvwmPagerHilightPixmap /root/icons/bg1.xpm
*FvwmPagerFore #ffffff
*FvwmPagerBack #555555
*FvwmPagerHighlight #666666
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 20
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
*FvwmPagerColumns 1
*FvwmPagerBalloons Pager
*FvwmPagerBalloonfore white



So I'm using absolute paths for the pixmaps. The pixmaps are in 
the right place, I checked. (I use the same .xpm's for the background
image, and this looks ok.)

The version of my fvwm2 is :



/root/icons# fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.2.2 compiled on Nov  5 1999 at 12:03:54



and when I look in the man page of FvwmPager it says:



FvwmPager(1.20)                                   FvwmPager(1.20)



I'll attatch my complete .fvwm2rc and the bitmaps to this mail.
Thanks in advance for helping me,


Jos.

Hi, 

I just found out that the pager version is also 2.2.2. 

When I invoke it from the command line: ./FvwmPager, it echos
that I should not do this, and it says it is version 2.2.2.

regards

Jos.

You seem to have an installation problem.  Perhaps the pager
in your search path is not the pager from 2.2.2.

I'm going to have to go with Dominik, try doing a ps and see what the
path to the pager fvwm is invoking then do a which FvwmPager and find
out which one you are picking up.  If your installation differs from the
way you compiled, then you need to set ModulePath in your rc file to
fvwm where to look, otherwise it looks in $prefix/libexec/fvwm/$version
which got defined during configure

Hi,

I have been having this problem during 3 years: whenever I turn on NumLock
while running fvwm2 all my key and mouse bindings stop working. It's very
annoying!

How can I fix it?

I have read in the FAQ:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

42) Why do NumLock and CapsLock interfere with ClickToFocus and/or my 
    mouse bindings?                                                   

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.                             

----------------------------------------------------------------------

But it doesn't say how to fix it, maybe because it's supposed I should know it?

The version of fvwm2 I use is 2.0.46-BETA-3

See you!

You can't fix it with that version of FVWM, AFAIK.  Maybe you could fix
it by using xmodmap or xkeycaps to change your server's keybindings so
that the NumLock shifted versions return the same values as the normal
versions.  Not sure if you can that or not.

In FVWM 2.4 (the next release) there is an IgnoreModifiers command that
will let you tell FVWM to ignore certain modifiers when matching mouse
and key bindings.  If you want to try it now you'll have to download a
beta or daily CVS snapshot.  See the Downloads page at http://www.fvwm.org

I have seen this done somewhere but can not remember where.
I would like to have a menu item that will start xterm or rxvt as
root shell.  I have experimented with the options for xterm and rxvt
but nothing has worked.

There are various ways.  One fairly foolproof method is to use:

  xterm -e /bin/su -

(or rxvt).

Hello,
   I am using fvwm-2.3.9 and I made FvwmButtons as a long bar. It is "stick" on my screen and FvwmButtons is not necessary all time
to me. I thought if one could simulate the AutoHide (from taskbar) behavior for FvwmButtons or if this feature could be (or already
is) in your feature-wished list.
   I think the fvwm most versatile wm.
   thanks in advance,

Lus

Found the answer: the pixmap in the pager is not yet
supported in 2.2.2, it should be 2.3.x

Hi, I'm the site manager for Themes.org.  We've had alot of requests to
bring back fvwm themes.  The only reason we dropped the site is because we
didn't have anyone to run it and themes weren't really coming in at all.
Well, in spite of all this, we'd still like to bring fvwm.themes.org back.
We have a new system, which will make setting up and running the site
easy, and we have most of the old themes still.  I know several people
(3-4) have volunteered to admin the site, but I have lost all my old mail
in my numerous mail server switches.  What is needed is someone(s) that
uses fvwm daily and knows it's history and has fvwm community contacts.
If you're interested, please reply to kfc@themes.org

Thank you,

Hi, I've got some questions concerning fvwm2:

 1) Is it possible to switch between fvwm2 and the linux
    consoles (without restarting)?

 2) Anybody know what happened to the themes site
    http://fvwm.themes.org ?

You can hit Ctrl-Alt-Fn to switch to console #n.  This may
be disabled in your Linux distribution.

Actually, we got a mail from themes.org yesterday. It explains what
happened.  I'll forward it to you.

This feature will probably added in the future in a more versatile way
(allowing to auto-hide any window, not just FvwmButtons).  I
experimented a bit with FvwmEvent and could roughly get the behaviour
you want.  My config looks like this:

  *FvwmButtonsGeometry 600x57+0-0
  ...
  *FvwmEvent focus_change "function showhidebuttons"
  ...
  AddToFunc showhidebuttons
  + "I" next (FvwmButtons) move 0p +765p
  + "I" current (FvwmButtons) move +0 -0

  AddToFunc InitFuction
  + "I" module FvwmEvent
  AddToFunc RestartFuction
  + "I" module FvwmEvent

My screen is 1024x768 pixels.  When any window gets focus, the
button bar will be moved down so that only a few pixels remain 
visible.  When FvwmButtons gets focus, it's moved back into view.
This works only with MosueFocus and SloppyFocus.  If you have a
swallowed modules in the button bar that can set focus they will
not work properly.  And you will see the button bar reaching into
lower pages on a pager.

Dominik ^_^

Hi

I have a wish for a feature in the FvwmPager. I'd like to 
have the possibility to turn off the dashed and solid lines
that separate the virtual screens in the pager, so that all
virtual screens appear as a single workspace.

regards,

Jos

You hit Ctrl-Alt-F7 to get back to the XServer window.
If this doesn't work, its an XServer issue, not the window manager.

Hi!

I have a question.

When restarting fvwm2, does the startup file get
processed by M4 again? The reason I'm asking this
is that I'd like to use themes in fvwm. To do this, 
I want to use several .fvwm2rc files, one for each 
theme. To activate a theme, I then copy the rc file
to the user's home directory and then restart 
the windowmanager. However, when using M4 in the rc
file, I could run into trouble if it doesn't get 
M4-ed again. (In fact I am running into trouble, and
I'm wondering if that is the reason.)

regards,

Jos van Riswick

It did when I used m4 to process my config file. I think I just restarted by
using `Restart'. You might be getting in trouble if you explicitly say
`Restart fvwm2'.

Hello,

    Dominik, I tested your configuration and it worked marvelously.
    My FvwmButton has width of 48 pixels and is vertical with whole height of screen and I changed your function a little to my
1152x864 screen and new location (at right hand side border) to

AddToFunc showhidebuttons
  + "I" next (FvwmButtons) move 1149p 0p
  + "I" current (FvwmButtons) move 1104p 0p

    So my worthy space grew up 46 pixels :))))) . I see 2 pixels to 
get buttons back and I don't need to limit my
maximize to get a "visible" maximum :)). Now I have my whole screen 
back to me :)
    I have swallowed apps and I think they had no problems (astime/push buttons/xpostit/iconman/pager) after these changes. 
    Thanks a lot,

    Lus

I'm sure other people are working on trying to make themes setups for
fvwm2 aswell.  I know I am but I don't really have much time right now
and it it's going slowly.

What I suggest is that all of us somehow get together that talk about
our ideas on this matter so we don't end up with a whole bunch of
conflicting ideas and setups.  Then we can get fvwm.themes.org up and
running again with some new cool fvwm2 themes.

just my $0.02

Yeah, there are about five to ten people I can think of who've
muttered things about "themes... no time." But lots of good ideas out
there.

Well, right here seems a good place to talk about themes. Unless the
traffic gets to the point where a fvwm-themes list is needed (I doubt
it belongs on fvwm-workers).

It's gone away, but I remember not liking the themes approach that had
been taken by fvwm.themes.org. First and foremost was the decision to
locate all the themes stuff in $HOME/fvwm. I think $HOME/.fvwm makes a
lot more sense. My local CVS tree is in $HOME/fvwm. Next, I didn't
think it appropriately distinguished between behaviors and themes.
Things like menu items and bindings could be distributed in a theme.
That was bad, IMHO.

There were some other things too. I forget. Anyway, if you've got
ideas about themes, just send 'em here. People may not have time to
write the system, but I'm sure they've got time to kibbitz on the list

Anybody remember fvwm2gnome? It seemed to have a fairly clean way of
distributing themes and a nice way of organizing everything. Certainly themes
don't have to support GNOME in any way, but it might be worth taking a look at
for a start.

Hi,

I recently installed the `potato' version of fvwm on my Debian box:  

% fvwm -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.2.3 compiled on Nov  2 1999 at 23:50:00

I had been running 2.0.46 before.

Now it seems that I can't get windows to come up where I want them
to.  I had been starting Netscape on another page by doing this:

AddToFunc InitFunction ...
...
+   "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/netscape -geometry 711x563+877+609
...

Which put it on  page 1 1 on my 800x600 screen.  Now it is coming
up on page 0 0.

I've tried SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement *and*
RandomPlacement, and even SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, but I can't
seem to get the behavior I want.

I'm sorry if this is a silly question, but I've scoured the man
page and searched deja.com in vain.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Why not use the StartsOnPage Style? I'm pretty sure it's present in
2.2.x. If not, insert the big spiel about 2.3 betas and the
anticipated 2.4 version here. With StartsOnPage, you get to change the
following to:

>AddToFunc InitFunction ...
>...
>+   "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/netscape -geometry 711x563+877+609
>...

+   "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/netscape -geometry 711x563+77+9

assuming you have:

Style "Netscape" StartsOnPage 0 1 1

Read the man page for further info. There are some gotchas to using
StartsOnPage... some GlobalOpts you might consider setting, some
placement Styles you want to be using.

That depends on the version you are using and on how you restart
fvwm. You should be on the safe side if you restart fvwm without
any arguments to the 'Restart' command. If everything else fails
you can provide the complete command line to the 'Restart' command.

The reason is a netscape bug. When you start netscape with an
explicit geometry, it still claims that the position is
'program specified' instead of 'user specified'. Usually fvwm
is set up to ignore all program specified positions. You can
disable this feature with the 'UsePPosistion' style:

  Style Navigator* UsePPosition

you may have to remove the 'NoPPosition' style from your config
file too. However, I'd recommend that you use one of the
StartsOn... styles instead.

I guess I must be just 1 of quite a lot of people doing this too.
My config is a directory structure of many separate files & dirs and about
3 1/2 meg in size. I currently only have 5 "themes" in my setup but there's an
easy way to add as many as I like. I can switch from "theme" to "theme" via a
menu option, or I could "pre-define" Function keys (on my 'to do list') WITHOUT
restarting fvwm2. I can also rearrange sounds via FvwmEvent via menus. There's
probably more I haven't done yet, than I have...

</unquote>

Now that's a _very_ good suggestion.
As a starting point for discussion, let's define a "theme".
It's already been proposed that menu items should not be changed or affected,
but surely MenuStyle's are fair game.
Fvwm2 confuses the 'traditional' way of organising themes, because of it's
Decor functions and many of the other fine features that set fvwm2 apart from
other WM's. Thus a users idea of what a theme consists of might vary greatly
amongst the members of this list.
Knowledgable rational debate followed by a consensus of opinion should surely
preceed any logical development of an "institutionalised" theme site for Fvwm2.
(imho)

I'm hoping to eventually encourage others to try my own .fvwm2rc config but not
if it would conflict with eventual developments with the window manager itself.
Perhaps if we work together, the (I'm sorry to say) pitiful sample.fvwm2rc that
is distributed with the .src.files could be replaced with the current
developing configs produced by members of this list and others. Or at least the
new "FVWM Themes" page could include more sample.fvwm2rc's that install without
effort, and run efficiently for the "default user".

I for one am eager to see "true" fvwm themes developed and distributed widely.
Even if it's just to show those kde guys what a WM can really do!  ;)

	BTW what can we call "themes" ? Could we say, for example, that a set
of M4 pre-processed fvwmrc files is a theme concept ? I use that to change easely
colors, borders, buttons and so on, without changing the "feel" and functions. If
we add a way to change "on the fly" (reprocess the files whith other macros via
another M4 file, and restart/recapture) with a menu, does it do the thing ?

Why would M4 be a necessary part of themes?

Doesn't "sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples" qualify as a theme implementation?

I'm not sure how many people actually read my long gone (long length)
post about how I was setting up my themes but I did have a few people
mention it on the list from time to mentioning I had some good ideas.
The m4 processing seems to be a good way to go.  Not for personal
personal theme setups put for distribution uses as something like
changing the button locations would IMHO quaiify as changing the feel
which probably shouldn't be done,  Something like
#DEFINE CLOSEBUTTON 1 or whatever I forget the syntax for m4 it might be
cpp then having  FvwmM4 proccess the file and replace CLOSEBUTTON in a
theme with where ever the close button is setup for the user.  I had a
few setups work this way and had m4 reading a separate file for the
defines, and the defines file was created by a FvwmScript script.

All sorts of ways this can go.

P.S. I don't have anything there yet but perhaps a depot of some of the
ideas people have been working on would be a good idea.   If anyone
wants feel free you perhaps upload your setups to my ftp site at
guyver.dhs.org/incoming, the ftp dir is hidden so you can't get a dir
listing (for search engine sake) just cd into incoming.   I'll place
them for d/l that way rather then just saying this or that someone else
can look at what you've done and give feedback etc...

P.S.Sif you upload something perhaps include a short readme or
something.  I'd like to mv the filenames around to the name of the
person that uploaded it for download purposes.

P.S.S.S perhaps even include a ss also

Well I'd start by ensuring any themes posted must be understandable/decipherable
 by using _only_ the man pages provided with the WM. Also any "theme" should be
'easily' added into a config for that version of fvwm2 or better! (with
possible minor changes) To make the theme as accessible to any user of fvwm2.

I don't think M4 is as commonly in use as Fabien obviously does. Any themes
that rely solely on M4 preprocessing would surely have to include more
explanation for the "default user" who probably has never heard of M4. But M4
versions of a theme could be an extra perhaps. 

And Dan Espen adds:

>Why would M4 be a necessary part of themes?
>
>Doesn't "sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples" qualify as a theme implementation?

At least it's a suggestion for a starting point.....

I'm having a look at it now Dan. I'll let you know.

I'd like to suggest that anyone working on this obtain the latest FVWM
2.3.x betas or at least get familiar with the new features.  We are
working towards many of these goals to greater or lesser extents for 2.4.

For example, FVWM 2.4 will have some colorset capability, so you can
just change a colorset and all modules and fvwm itself will change
(currently it (sometimes?) requires a restart but I think Dominik is
trying to change that).

Also there's a new initial setup environment where if you don't have an
.fvwm2rc file, FvwmForm menus can be used to set up some modules, etc.
This introduces a new, blessed ~/.fvwm/* directory.

I'm not even up on all the things in 2.4 anymore, but anyone working on
theme-ifying FVWM should definitely check them out.

Also, of course we're always interested in hearing about anything you
think could be added to FVWM to make your job (of adding themes) easier.
Can't promise we'll implement them all, but we want to hear them! :)

	Which brings me back to my first question : what is exactly
a "theme" ? :-)
	Does it include that "default user" must be able to create easely his own,
or just choose beetwen existing ones ?

I had a look at it Dan, and it's almost exactly how I've setup my config,
except all the functions relating to a decor I've grouped into separate files.
In fact I started out with one of Mr. gensch's earlier examples and progressed
from there. I just decided after my config grew over 2000 lines long that many
little files were easier to wade through than one BIG file. To start with I put
a symlink from ~/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc
   So my directory structure looks like this....

~/.fvwm2rc                    # a symlink to ~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc
~/.fvwm2/.decor-rc        # a file to tell fvwm2 where to find each decor
~/.fvwm2/.fvwm2rc         # a file to set $PATH's and InitFunction's
~/.fvwm2/.module-rc      # a file to tell fvwm2 about the module configs
~/.fvwm2/.style-rc          # a file to set global styles (lots work needed)   
~/.fvwm2/backgrounds    # a folder to keep background pics
~/.fvwm2/decors             # a folder to keep my decor files tidy
~/.fvwm2/icons	            # I added this directory to IconPath or ImagePath
                                    # and keep my customised icons here.
~/.fvwm2/menus              # at the moment I keep separate menus for each   
                                    #decor (needs work) in this folder
~/.fvwm2/modules           # here each module can have several configs to be 
                                    # loaded by the decors whenever called for.
 ~/.fvwm2/scripts             # a folder for FvwmScript files 
~/.fvwm2/sounds             # I put separate folders for each decor FvwmEvent
                                    # sounds here and add them to rplay.conf

Thus all of my decors, (currently only Win95,Mwm,AfterStep, a DrWho theme, and
my personal customised decor) are each in a separate file along the lines of the
cited above example. But each file is only 2 or 3k in size. I also have a
symlink to the "default" decor that fvwm2 starts/restarts with. And a menu to
select same. (yup.... needs more work) Each theme has it's own FvwmEvent
config, and each Event config is selectable via an FvwmForm module. Even
individual sounds/commands can be set/reset. There's many more features I've
added but probably too long a list to include here. If anyone wants to "try
out" a copy of my config, please email me off list. 

Using this setup I'm able to read-in any part of the config via FvwmConsole or
Talk/CommandS whatever.... for testing etc.... I can also temporarily rm the
symlink ~/.fvwm2rc and point it at any .rc file I want. so I can try out other
configs. Using ModulePath allows symlinks to the modules as well as their
configs to be placed in the ~/.fvwm2/modules directory. As I add decors they
also need to be added into the .decor-rc and at the moment also the individual
menus. 
So to answer Fabien's question, "what exactly is a theme?", in my setup
a theme is a decor that calls it's own set of modules, styles, configs, sounds
etc, and is easily switched to another without restarting fvwm. Even individual
windows can switch decors/themes. But it's a work very much in progress. Even if
it's only progressing slowly. 24 hrs is never enough in a day. I have a 'life'
too. (well almost)

It's proven to be a very versatile arrangement, but requires a lot of minor
adjustments to many files, as features evolve and change with the current rapid
development Fvwm2 is going through. No doubt I'll need to make many more
changes by the time vers 2.4. comes out! C'est la unix.....Thus any proposed
theme needs qualification (as implied by Paul D.Smith), as to the version syntax
it complies with. A good time to pre-select standards if 2.4 is not far off.

At the moment I'm trying to make my config into an easy-install package when I
can find enough time, but it will also need some extensive pruning and editing
as I've got a lot of experimental stuff that either nearly/almost/or_never_will
werks kind of stuff in there too. I'm also sure that M4 preprocessing could
reduce the bulkiness of my config and speedup loading if I can ever find the
time to learn how to do that as well. 
I still think that the "default user" (whoever that may be) will have enough
man pages to read, without needing an M4 instruction page to add to it.
Maybe others could suggest better ways to add all these features.
No doubt they will.....

You know, I'd actually like to start a little script that will convert
between enlightenment themes and fvwm themes. The only issue is with batch
processing the png's to xpm, which brings me to a question... Can FVWM
handle anything other than XPM or XBM format images? If not, are there any
plans to support other formats in the future? 

I wanna read up on FvwmTheme but I don't have the time right
now. Actually, I really just wanna port the minEguE from enlightenment :-)

I recently (just today, actually) upgraded my fvwm2 installation and the
WindowList function bound to alt-tab works strangely. Why will it only let me
choose a limited subset of the available windows? I hit tab and it only cycles
through about half the windows. What is going on?

  one thing that I didn't see mentioned is that the themes should be easy to
customize. for example I like new graphical looks but I am not that eager to
change my menus and key/mouse bindigs. however, i would still want to be
able to try out the theme's own menus/keybindings (so that I can improve my
own ones).

  to make this work we need some sort of canonical template for config files
that are flexible enough yet easy to navigate/browse/understand/change. I
sort of like the way the fvwm.themes.org had it organized (well, except the
fvwm dir should be .fvwm as was suggested here before etc.), in a general
way.

  each theme should probably have it's own directory within .fvwm directory,
so that one can switch from theme to theme, add and remove themes easily.
each directory would have same structure.

  each theme has one main config file that read other files, this main file
would be the same for each theme and would look something like this:

Read .theme-name-startup
Read .theme-name-modules
Read .theme-name-theme
Read .theme-name-menu
Read .theme-name-key
Read .theme-name-mouse

  (paraphrazed from the theme from fvwm.themes.org).

  that way you could easily change the key binds and leave the rest alone,
or have common startup file (that sets up path to icons and modules) etc.

  I can imagine that it would be fairly easy to write a tool that would
enable one to change/combine themes.

  this is, of course, very sketchy and rough, it reflects my experience with
configuring the fvwm2.

  the files itself should have some kind of organized layout, so that I
would know where to go to change general styles, where to go to change focus
policies etc. I am not saying that every theme should have to have the very
same layout, but it would have a lot to have a template you can use so you
don't have to reinvent the overall structure. the themes then would work
much better together and it would be easier to create themes, you'd
concentrate on theme, not on the layout of the files.

I guess I'm probably a bit late..

FWIW, I've got an fvwm theme setup on my page which is similar
to fvwm.themes.org's setup but with some improvements.  I was
pretty disgusted by some of the problems in their setup, but
mine isn't perfect either.  :)

	http://www.vis.colostate.edu/~scriven/fvwm.php3

Here are a few differences, off the top of my head:

 - You can have a system-wide configuration which can be
   overridden or modified by users' individual configurations.

 - It separates "look" from "feel" by putting input bindings in
   their own file.

 - You can switch themes from a menu, without restarting fvwm.
 
 - Themes can be randomly selected upon startup.
 
 - Themes do not include wallpaper, but it should be easy to
   incorporate them using the "bkgd" script on my page.  (for
   example, set a random "green" background with a green theme)
   
 - 12 themes are included; more will come as people make them.
   Two of these were from fvwm.themes.org, the rest are mine.

One problem: It currently requires windows to have 4 title
buttons, a menu on the left and minimize-maximize-close on the
right.  This gives a consistent feel, but restricts visual
freedom for theme designers.

I think this is really important, too.

This is nice. Basically, themes ought to be set-able with a:
Read theme/theme
or something like that. That means that decors, etc. of the existing
theme should be destroyed before reading, and that, to be safe, before
creating any new structures, a well-behaved theme should destroy
itself. Fortunately, Dominik's working on Style so that they apply
immediately without issuing Recapture... Hope it's ready for 2.4.
Would make theming a lot easier. Otherwise all themes should conclude
with a Recapture.

Really, most of this junk can be automated by designing some built-in
functions that all themes load, like "_DestroyThisTheme" and
"_ReadNewTheme".

FvwmBacker seems to be perfectly alright for this purpose. It relies
on an external program like xv(1) or display(1) for setting background

FvwmTheme/Colorset compatible.

I remember this one being troublesome to me too. On the one hand,
window buttons are, without doubt, behavior-related, but they also are
an important part of the GUI look. It'd be silly if you have a classic
MWM button layout (0 for menu, 1 for maximize, 3 for minimize) and you
loaded a Win95-style button theme... the buttons would look like they
did things other than what they did, unless you rebound the actions...
bad news, IMHO. Perhaps there's a way to preprocess so that the theme
Does The Right Thing WRT the buttons the user has chosen to bind. I'm
not even sure if that's possible, but it certainly seems the most
desirable thing to do. (In case it's not clear what I mean by "Does
The Right Thing", I mean that the theme should provide a set of
buttons for: menu, min, max, close. It should add buttons where they
belong.)

Any comments, further ideas, etc.?

I vaguely recall some discussion of linking to imlib or something
similar if it was present. I no longer recall why anyone wanted it...
Maybe to create xpms from gradients? As a required library, I think it
was kinda unpopular.

As to batch converting png2xpm, what's the issue?

Hi,

I added a serial keypad to my system,,  xev sees these "kr" keys but
fvwm2 doesn't seem to bind them...  Any idea why this is?  I did
recompile...  Don't know how much help it did since the source doesnt
ref the XK_kr definitions.

I'm severely disabled and this added keypad doubles as my mouse...

Parts of my config follow.

Thanks

Kirk

I personally think random backgrounds silly. Especially on my resource starved

I can set as many buttons as I like or don't like in my themes. With each theme
having appropriate layouts. e.g. my Mwm has buttons 1,2 & 3 ; AfterStep has
buttons 1,2, 3 & 4 ; Win95 has buttons 1,2,4  & 6 etc...Each button has it's
key bindings set as appropriate in the themes decor file. So AfterStep buttons
do what buttons do under the AfterStep WM, likewise Mwm., Win95, etc... My own
customized theme has multi-function buttons that have several key bindings
apiece.

All this is not only possible/achievable, but also a lot more that hasn't been
mentioned yet. Such as.....
On my 'to do list':
	Create-A-Theme module
	Change-A-Theme module
	Save-A-Theme module
	Load-A-New-Theme module
and       Load-User-Specified-fvwm2rc-Config  via dynamic menu selection, with
a 'hotkey'  to return to my configuration as desired, thus enabling painless
testing of others configs. I see these features as being just as desirable.
I will implement them as time permits. 
Contributions and/or suggestions most welcome. If anyone cares to send me
their "themes" I will gladly insert them into this config, leaving due credit
intact. It will help me design ways to "read-in" new themes and to learn what
people expect/want.

Do these keys appear when you issue 'xmodmap -pke'? Are there any
error messages from fvwm? Do these keys work in some other application?

I'm not sure how this worked before since I never use the winlist.
But it may be possible that this has something to do with some
changes in menu key bindings I made a while back. Can you desribe
exactly what happens and which keys you press? I noticed that
alt-tab itself does not do what you might expect. Pressing it
will jump to the first window on the previous desk in the menu
tab/shift-tab move down/up by a single window.

After being a little more intelligent and actually thinking about what I was
doing, I realized that I was expecing alt-tab to do the same thing as tab.
What it does is much more useful. Thanks!

Hello!

I'm configuring the fvwm2 (2.3.10) windowmanager on my
pc and I've run into a few problems:

 * When I make a 'sub-panel' pop up out of the FvwmButtons
panel, It's position is determined relative to the position
of the button that is depressed to make it op up.  Is it
possible to fix the geometry (including offset) of a popup
panel? I'd like to let my pager pop up from a button, but
the pager should always be located on the same position.

 * When I swallow FvwmIconMan into a sub panel, is it
possible to let the panel grow as the number of entries in
the iconmanager gets larger?

regards,

Jos van Riswick

Yes, if someone codes it. Since this would entail a whole
lot of code to be useful I decided for now not to spend
more time on this before 2.4. Since the main benefit of the
panels is the sliding animation and that they are placed relative
to the button bar I don't see why you would need a panel here.
You can simply have a button that opens and closes your pager:

  *FvwmButtons(Name pager, Action ToggleFvwmPager)
  AddToFunc ToggleFvwmPager
  + I None (FvwmPager) Module FvwmPager
  + I Next (FvwmPager) Close

Then you can place the pager whereever you want with the
'FvwmPagerGeometry' option. Perhaps I will code some class
of 'toggle' button that does exactly this some day.

I think you can tell the icon manager the direction in which
it should grow.  FvwmButtons doesn't care about the size of
the panel windows.

About buttons... I think it could be a separated thing, I mean that once you
have selected a "theme" you could change just the buttons, so for each "theme"
you could choose between (for example) 5 different buttons combinations,
however I don't know if it would be easy to do or ever possible.

The buttons combination I use now is:

Mouse 1 1 N Close
Mouse 1 1 C Destroy

Mouse 1 3 A Popup Window-Ops
Mouse 1 5 A iconify

Mouse 1 7 N exec /usr/bin/X11/xlock -remote -mode random -modelist allnice
-fullrandom -neighbors 0
Mouse 1 7 C exec /usr/bin/X11/xlock -remote -mode random -modelist all
-fullrandom -neighbors 0

(I use this last very often)

Mouse 1 2 A maximize 100 100
Mouse 1 4 A Maximize 0 100
Mouse 1 6 A maximize 100 0

And actually I am thinking about a eighth button for maximizing a xterm/rxvt in
a way it looks like a Linux console (i.e. without watching the borders...).

I have been using fvwm for a long time now and am quite impressed in the
number of options in the newer versions, but there still seems to be a few
things missing. If somebody can tell me how to configure any of the
following, I'd be very grateful. Otherwise, they might possibly be added
to some wish-list...?

- Can key binding be program-specific? My brother has configured his fvwm
so that alt-click anywhere on a window does the same as a click on the
top bar (raise, move, etc) and that would be very useful. But the problem
is that GIMP uses alt-click for it's own purposes and capturing them from
GIMP would limit it's functionality. Is it possible to set alt-clicks to
work in such a way for all except GIMP-windows?

- An old version (1.x I believe) with smartplacement set the first window
on a screen at position 0x0, the newer versions set it at 1x1. This I find
very irritating, as I can't just "throw" my cursor to the upper left and
get focus into the xterm there (my focus follows the mouse. I don't want
to use SloppyFocus). Is it possible to get fvwm not to leave these
empty-spaces?

- In an older version there was a "bug" that when sliding the mouse cursor
on the top of a window left or right (over the border) fvwm didn't scroll
to the next page (You had to move it at least one pixel down so that it
scrolled. The same was with the bottom edge. This, of course, only worked
on the upper page). It has, evidently, been fixed in a newer release, but
I find myself missing it. This would be nice so you could "throw" your
mouse northwest as I described previously on other pages than the leftmost
too.

Thanks.

Doh, just found what I think might be a bug on the TitleAtBottom style.

Menus, they show up where the button would be if the title bar is at

the top rather then from where the button is now.  Maybe just a feature

in progress

There are obviously many ideas about themes and how to implement
them.  I'm wondering ... would it make sense to take an rfc approach
with this issue?  I would be willing to coordinate such an effort
if that would help.  I'm not an FVWM expert by any means, but I
am willing to do what I can.

sounds good to me. If we could get a standard going, it would make it
easier and more uniform in order to break up configs and have drop in
themes. As long as my ls -lad .fvwm* looks like ".fvwm2/" I have no issues
:)

Always willing  to  expose my ignorance,   I don't know what   an "rfc
approach"  would be like.  I've read  RFCs, I'm just not familiar with
the creation process.

I'd like to  pursue this as  patches to "sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples"
that would put a  few  basic decors  into  fvwm2 itself and  then  the
themes   could  reside  wherever   and  be   built  on top.   Note how
"decor_examples"  creates a  "DecorMenu".  I  would hope  that part of
creating a theme would be to add an entry to the "DecorMenu".

I was hoping to hook this up to the config creation stuff in
"fvwm/ConfigFvwmSetup".  I don't know if I'll get to this, so patches
would be nice.

(All this is referring to new functionality that only appears in the
2.3.x betas.)

I would love to see this happen and am also willing to help out. Especially
since I am the new maintainer of http://fvwm.themes.org/ and I don't want to
have the community ranting at me for a rotten method of setting up themes. :)

Uh, with all the work I spent with style changes, couldn't we
just forget about decors and do it with separate files that
read in certain groups of styles? Perhaps we need a better
'UseStyle' style that can be updated at run time.

Al this 'Theme' stuff is closely related to a potential future
configuration fvwm module/application/script.  If we can write
or edit the config files with such a tool we are already halfway
there.  Can FvwmForm be our config tool?  What I dream about is
an application that fakes a window or menu and where you can click
on the parts to get a dialog to change the corresponding settings.
If the output of such scripts is is grouped in several files,
implementing a theme would be as easy as replacing one or more of
the files and perhaps restart fvwm (I hope that this is not
necessary).

Actually, I think a combined approach would be nice. One thing I don't
like about the way themes work in KDE and gnome is how a theme doesn't
allow for settings of colors that don't have to do with a theme, and
selecting a new theme completely trashes little tweaks you might have had
before. 

I think the ability to have some global decors might allow a file-based
theme be more flexible, and users would be able to choose what it is that
a theme is allowed to change wrt look or feel.

I didn't mean to imply that we wouldn't have separate files.  I'd just
like to migrate  the stuff in  "decor_examples" into whatever  the new
scheme is.  I wouldn't like to still have "decor_examples" when we are
done.

Its bad enough that we still have "system.fvwm2rc".  I forget why that
wasn't deleted when  all of it  migrated to ConfigFvwmSetup, but there
was some objection.

I don't know if FvwmForm is flexible enough we'd have to see.
I think FvwmScript might be up to it, but I don't know the module yet.
But for pre-written themes, AddToMenu might be enough.  (You read the
theme, and it adds itself to the menu.)

I'd prefer  to  stay   away  from anything that   requires  additional
packages.

I have more to say about reading in response to another mail...

In the 2.3.x series, we have new functionality that relates to this.

If you export FVWM_USERHOME="$HOME/.fvwm", you can then say
"Read Theme1" and it attempts to first read
"$HOME/.fvwm/Theme1" and then in "<install_prefix>/etc/fvwm/Theme1".

This allows Theme1 to exist in either place so you could use the installed
version, or your own copy.

The other way to do this is to make the read command specify
the sub-directory:

"Read .fvwm/Theme1"

If we are going to have site-wide themes, this gets a little ugly.
The file would be "<install_prefix>/etc/fvwm/.fvwm/Theme1".

I have to admit, there are some gaps in how I see this thing
being designed...

I've worked on this a while, I guess I need someone else to look at it.

I'd like to build a  web page that illustrates what  can be done  with
vector buttons.   I'd  like to do that   by creating a window  with 10
vector buttons on it and them grabbing  its image.  I have driver like
this:

# Test bed for vector buttons:
DestroyFunc button_demo
AddToFunc   button_demo
+ I 10_buttons
+ I Style "button_demo_style" UseDecor $0
+ I Exec xv -name button_demo_style -geometry 155x100

# -- Start of 10 button layout --
DestroyFunc 10_buttons
AddToFunc   10_buttons
+ I Style "button_demo_style" NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 3
+ I Style "button_demo_style" NoButton 4, NoButton 5, NoButton 6
+ I Style "button_demo_style" NoButton 7, NoButton 8, NoButton 9, NoButton 10
+ I Style "button_demo_style" Button 1, Button 2, Button 3
+ I Style "button_demo_style" Button 4, Button 5, Button 6
+ I Style "button_demo_style" Button 7, Button 8, Button 9, Button 10
+ I Mouse 0   1 A     "Iconify"
+ I Mouse 0   3 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   5 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   7 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   9 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   2 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   4 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   6 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0   8 A     Nop
+ I Mouse 0  10 A     Nop

DestroyDecor    DecorDemo1
AddToDecor      DecorDemo1
+ TitleStyle Centered
+ TitleStyle Height 40
+ TitleStyle (Solid blue -- Flat)
+ ButtonStyle Reset
+ ButtonStyle 1  5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 2  5 45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1
+ ButtonStyle 3  5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 4  5 45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1
+ ButtonStyle 5  5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 6  5 45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1
+ ButtonStyle 7  5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 8  5 45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1
+ ButtonStyle 9  5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 10 5 45x45@1 55x45@1 55x55@0 45x55@0 45x45@1

I then invoke this by entering the command:

button_demo DecorDemo1

So far,  I have 2 problems:

I  normally have pixmaps   on some of  my   buttons.  The  above logic
doesn't remove them.   I end of  with some of  the buttons on the  new
window still showing pixmaps.

The above affects all newly created windows, not just the ones
that match the style "DecorDemo1".

Well staying away from more "fluff" in the packages is certainly

a good idea.

I also believe that FvwmForm is not flexible enough on it's own

however in use with a sh script it would be quick simple, but

then we run into the fluff problem.

I was/am working on a FvwmScript to do this, I've run into a

few problems here and there script and hardware wise in the

last few months so I haven't touched it in weeks. but at present

you can tell it if you want the style additions, titlebars, sound

buttons, etc.  I have yet to add FvwmTheme support however.

If this sound like it might meet the idea I can finish up the

FvwmTheme stuff in it and give out copies to play with.

Are you still using 2.2? If yes, can you try this with the 2.3.9
release?

Hi,

What are other commands/variables that I need to set to put these
button in a window and do what I want?  i.e. click on the big button will
expand 
the window full screen, click tall button will expand window to maximum
y-direction,
click skinny button will expand window to maximum x-direction, and click on
dot button
will minimize the window.

I have these variables set but it does not work.

#ButtonStyles:
# big box
ButtonStyle 2 5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
# tall box
ButtonStyle 4 5 40x25@1 60x25@1 60x75@0 40x75@0 40x25@1
# skinny box
ButtonStyle 6 5 25x40@1 25x60@1 75x60@0 75x40@0 25x40@1
# dot
ButtonStyle 8 5 40x40@1 60x40@1 60x60@0 40x60@0 40x40@1

Those commands just decorate the buttons.  You assign functions to
the buttons like this:

Mouse 0 2 A Iconify

Which says, "any mouse button" (0), on button 2, with any modifier,
invokes the command "Iconify".

I think you will find more examples in the man page.

The ButtonStyle command affects only the looks of the buttons.
Put this in your config file:

  Mouse 1 2 A Maximize 100 100
  Mouse 1 4 A Maximize 0 100
  Mouse 1 6 A Maximize 100 0
  Mouse 1 8 A Iconify

For the record, I had another glitch this morning.  Fvwm disappeared
from the X display.  fvwm2 and the modules I used still showed up on
ps.  I tried "kill -USR1" on the fvwm2 process but this killed the
processes completely.  That command does normally work to restart
fvwm.

Um, do you mean the top right corner?

I don't know.  The only thing I know is that you won't see buttons
that have no mouse or key bindings defined.  Thus, if you don't have
the 

  Mouse 1 8 A Iconify

line you won't see button 8. If you can't solve this problem, please
send me your config file.

Bye

Pete, I still don't know what could be the cause of the problem.
Are there no traces of what has happened anywhere?

Sorry Dominik, I had an offline message on this, where we went
thru the "no mouse" binding issue and resolved this.

I should have replied to the list even though the question came to me.

I see several problems:

 1) The style name 'button_demo_style' doesn't apply to my xv window
    because it's called 'button_demo_style <unregistered>'.
    'button_demo_style*' should do the trick.

 2) As soon as you issue the 'Mouse ...' bindings, all ten buttons
    are enabled for *all* windows, but you won't notice this until
    you do a 'recapture'. Hence you get the default vectors on new
    windows that don't match the style name (including the xv window
    for me).

 3) This also explains why you still see the pixmap: because the
    style doesn't match, the style ==> the decor ==> the new
    ButtonStyle is never applied to these windows ==> the pixmap
    is never removed.

 4) The line

      + I Mouse 0  10 A     Nop

    doesn't do what you think.  It will override the binding of button
    1 and button 0 since the context bit is one character each. Thus
    the 'iconify' binding doesn't work.

To prevent these new buttons from showing up on all new windows you
will need something like

  Style * NoButton 5, NoButton 7, NoButton 9, NoButton 8, NoButton10

Heck, this decor/buttonstyle/borderstyle/titlestyle stuff is really
screwed up.  We have to clean it up one day.

Which version are you using? There was a similar bug in the code for a few
days recently, but you had had to access CVS to get this.

Duh. How did you move back into the page if you didn't want to
flip pages?

Further to the previous discussions about Themes for Fvwm2, I have written a
form to edit FvwmThemeColorset [options] on the 'fly'. It saves these options
to a ${FVWM_USERHOME}/.fvwm2_pallette file, in a comma separated format 
as specified in the man page, using techniques from the examples in
${EXEC_PREFIX}/etc/fvwm  - 2 options for colorsets numbered 1 to 8 can be 
edited,  and multiple colorset options are allowed within a 30 character limit.
e.g.
# This file last created by ColorsetOptions on: Thu Nov 18 13:15:42 CST 1999.
*FvwmThemeColorset 1 fg cyan3, bg rgb:b4/aa/94, hi rgb:a1/b2/c8, sh orange4
*FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg DarkGreen, bg grey60
<--snip-->
The default colors were randomly chosen (I don't use any kind of color-chart)
so you'll have to set them properly for yourself. There's no documentation for
it yet, not even embedded comments. (sorry) It seems to work for me, but as I've
only recently upgraded to fvwm-2.3.9, I still have a lot of Colorset options to
place into my now fairly extensive configuration to get the full benefits of
this new module. This means I also haven't fully 'bug-tested' it yet.
?Gradient, Pixmap and Shape options should work but need testing as I have yet
to implement them into my "themes". If anyone would care to 'try it out' and
let me know of 'bugs' or just 'what they think', I would appreciate it greatly.
This file is 90 lines or so long, so please email me (awol@dove.net.au)
off-list and I'll attach it to my reply. I only have a 'dial-in' account so
don't expect an instantaneous reply, but I do check my email several times a
day, so it shouldn't be too long a wait.

90 lines is small enought to post here.

BTW there is an FvwmScript script to edit the colors in colorsets, it is
in the Scripts/ directory and is called Colorset. It doesn't save
settings but it does have RGB sliders.  It should be in tommorrows
snapshot (fvwm-snap-19991119.tar.gz) and is in the CVS ftp site at 
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/modules/FvwmScript/Scripts/Colorset

Cheers,
Tim.

Sorry, I'm using version 2.2.2 (coming along with Slackware 7.0, but the
same thing was also with an older fvwm2 version). Don't get me wrong: in
my opinion the windows should be set exactly on the border, the first one
at 0x0. Of course, somebody might like spaces between the windows and
borders, but I find it irritating.

Oops. I meant "...on the top of a page...", not window. I don't quite
understand your question, perhapse you misunderstood my explanation also
(I realize it might be a bit confusing).

I use an EdgeResistance of 0 and EdgeScroll of 100 100. On the older
version (2.2.2 is the first one I've missed it. On an older fvwm2 it was
still there) when you slid the mouse cursor on the top (pixel 0) of a page
(a top page, otherwise it would have scrolled up) to the edge, it didn't
scroll (sideways). You had to move the cursor at least one pixel down
(pixel 1) to get it to scroll. Otherwise the scrolling worked fine.

What I suggest is a configurable option how many pixels around the corners
of the screen are "deactivated" from page flipping. It may sound like a
strange request, but I find it quite useful. Then again, it might not be
good for the corners where a page is diagonally located (the cursor would
get trapped in it when trying to move there). In that case you couldn't
slide it along the border to the corner anyway.


This version (I have not noticed it on any other) also seems to have a bug
conserning window movement. If you grab a window whilst moving the cursor 
the window lags behind the cursor quite badly.

If, for example, you grab a window while moving the mouse up and then stop
the mouse, the window moves less so that there are 10-100 pixels between
the cursor and the titlebar. The faster you move the mouse, the more space
it lags. I have only noticed it in function with Move as the Motion ("M")
-action. It seems like fvwm "forgets" the movement that the mouse already
has moved at the point when it activates the Motion-action (Move) and
starts moving the window.

Thanks for the tip! I went and grabbed it straight away. Pretty good interface.
Too bad he was too tired to finish it. Never mind, maybe one day.
Anyway, my form _does_ have a save button, AND you can test new colors
before you save them, returning to last save if you 'mess up'. The big
drawback of course with my script is you _have_ to type the options manually.
No spiffy sliders! C'est la unix!

  I haven't had the same problem since, it's quite rare, but when it
happened I couldn't find anything wrong... it's just that the fvwm was not
displayed - as if the connection to X server wouldn't work (without fvwm
knowing it!). I have the same configuration as Pete has (fvwm on solaris,
exceed X server on NT).

I am running FVWM 2.2 on RedHat 6. Since I am relatively new to both, I am 
using RedHat's Another Level default configuration with only a few minor colour 
and font changes.
This works fine usually, except that sometimes (I don't know what it is related 
to, unfortunately) the Buttons in the top window bar stop working. All the 
functions like resize, hide, etc. do however still work if invoked from the 
menu.
Does any one know what is happening?
Cheers, Aron

(Is this a valid theme implementation?)

I've attached a file for a form which can be invoked by the command
"Module FvwmForm ThemeOptions." in the usual fashion.
The form groups up to 5 colorsets under a "theme" name and saves
them to 2 files. Any number of "themes" can be loaded, edited, and saved at
any time, with multiple complex colorset options apparently OK.

The first file this form creates is  called .fvwm2_$(ThemeName).options
A set of strings to manipulate the colorsets. 
Which brings me to my first question.
Everything seems to work fine... so why am I getting these errors?
e.g.
ThemeOptions.: Active command unknown: *ThemeOptions.UseData .fvwm2_default.options *ThemeOptions.Default

I know I'm probably doing something in an unorthodox manner, and I've
certainly learned that syntax is all important to fvwm2. Can anyone explain?

The second file is the set of FvwmThemeColorset options suitable for reading
at the start of your .fvwm2rc in the format .fvwm2_theme.$(ThemeName)
So that's my next question. Now that I can create as many "themes" as I like,
as names instead of numbers, what exactly is the syntax for specifying
Read .fvwm2_theme.*
?
TIA

FvwmForm is complaining about receiving the UseData command
after it finished reading all its configuration commands.
Thats what the "Active command unknown" part is about.

As FvwmForm stands now, you have to exit and start a new FvwmForm
in order to read new data.  I'm not sure how you are going to
get the same form to read in different themes.  Perhaps you
can create a form for each on the fly?

Or, some code changes in FvwmForm might be in order.

I think you can get PipeRead to do this for you.

Beware of the PipeRead example in the  man page, when I just displayed
it under XEmacs with  M-x man, all the  good pieces of the example are
suppressed.

Oh, it loads the new themes fine, no problems! There's just this 
strange message in my logs when it does, that's all. Apart from that,
you can create, load, edit, save, as many 'themes' as you like.

What exactly is the syntax, the man pages have examples that don't
actually work for me without 'tweaking'.

I'd suggest some more revamping of the man page, if anyone had the time.
With new features, come new routines etc... Some of the examples are
obviously past their 'use-by-date'. But someone is probably already
planning this...no?

I didn't try 2.2.x, but in the 2.3.x betas it's definitely fixed.

I think we won't need an option here.  The new 2.3.x code won't move the
window over the page boundary as long as you keep the pointer moving
fast enough. This should allow you what you want (with a bit of practice)
while still fixing that weird 'move back one pixel' bug.

Yes, I guess I've hear this a thousand times now :-) It's fixed in 2.3.x.
Not that this ever happened on my machine. I guess it has something to do
with the X server.

I've updated  the man page in the  latest CVS.  (The JpgMenu example.)
The whole example will now get displayed, and it  worked for me when I
tested it.

I  think JpgMenu is close   enough to what you  want   to do that  you
shouldn't have a problem.

Actually, I think we are pretty careful to keep the man pages current.

If you spot anything that doesn't seem right, please don't hesitate to
point it out.

I hope that will be configurable. I like the consept of paging because it
gives me more desk space (I have 8x2 pages, of which I sometimes use about
10) and I want to be able to move about them as fast as I can move withing
one page (almost), so I don't want anything resisting my movement between
pages (unless I specifically want it, as in the top corners).

I've looked thru the archives and it's not clear if I can run a gnome
based backdrop manager under FVWM1.24r.  What I want is a "simple" way
to have the backdrop display 4 local weather maps to determine if it's
a good day to go soaring.  I use about 13 virtual desktops and the
couple programs I've tried so far are total duds.

Thanks

In the last couple of weeks there's been some discussion on this
list regarding "themes" and what exactly are they.
With the direction the current development of fvwm2 is taking,
I offer the attached form for consideration, discussion, and as a
contribution. 

After several name changes, the form is now invoked by the command 
	"Module FvwmForm FormFvwmTheme."
The form allows the user to create, load, browse, edit, save and test
any combination of valid colorsets. Libraries of colorsets can be easily created
by using any saved colorset as a template, editing it, and saving it as a new name.
Unfortunately, no attempt is made at any error checking, so care must be taken
not to overwrite an existing colorset number sequence. Up to 5 colorsets per form
unless multiple entries are made to allow for ?Gradient and Pixmap options.

The module saves information for each theme to 2 files. One for it's own use, 
and one suitable for FvwmTheme. The latter files can be read by fvwm2, 
by inserting the following lines in .fvwm2rc after the ModulePath and ImagePath.

Piperead 'for i in $HOME/.fvwm2_theme.* ; do echo Read $i ; done'
ModuleSynchronous Timeout 5 FvwmTheme

Also attached to this posting is a 'default' theme to get you started. :-)
All comments and suggestions regarding this 'theme' implementation welcome.
Let me know what you think.

Alex

P.S. Many thanks to Dan Espen for his friendly help & suggestions.

Hello all,

I've searched the archives for a reference to key modifiers.  Unless I've missed
something, (a distinct possibility) there is no way to add a key modifier.

What I want in specific is to make the windows keys into a modifier, in addition
to the shift, control, and meta keys.

What would also be nice is to be able to specify left or right modifiers.  Has
anyone done this, or does this require a modification of the window manager?

If so, how likely is it that the authors are interested in doing this?  I
haven't even found this mentioned in the archives, so maybe it's not a big thing
to everyone else.

It may also be that this can be accomplished through some other product, but I
don't understand how.  If someone knows this, please tell me.  Thanks.

You're looking in the wrong place.

You redefine your keyboard, including modifiers, via the X server not
the window manager, typically using xmodmap.  There's a cool graphical
program called xkeycaps that makes it _much_ simpler to do.

AFAIK FVWM will support any modifier you bind to your Windows key.

What parts exactly are not working?

  - the title bar?
  - the title buttons?
  - the border and corners?

Double-clicking the title-bar maximises/minimises as before, move also works. I 
can also resize the window by clocking on the corners and dragging. It is only 
the three buttons (pop-up all window options, iconify, maximise/minimise) that 
don't work. Sorry for not making that clear before,
Aron

Hi!


I'm configuring the fvwm window manager on my pc and I have 
a question: is it possible to popup the WindowList and let it
stay visible, also after a button on it has been pressed? 
I prefer the WindowList over FvwmWindowList, because the latter
doesn't display icons. But WindowList doesn't stay visible...
So what i'm looking for is a 'tearoff' option for menus, is 
this possible?

regards,

Jos van Riswick

Tearoff menus aren't working yet.

The FvwmWindowList will display mini icons.

hi

can anyone save me the trouble of understanding the man page of
fvwm-menu-directory and tell me if there is a way of implementing a simple
file browser with an associated application to open the files? what i'm
thinking of is somthing like what's done in WindowMaker, where a submenu can
just browse a directory and open its files with a particular
application. can this be done in the same way in fvwm-2.3.9? can different
applications be specified in different menu entries? can anyone send
examples, please? thanx!

mario

I submitted a modified menu-browse script that sent the result to
FvwmDragWell.  You could then
drag and drop the selection onto FvwmWharf.  However, FvwmWharf was never
updated.  It is very useful
with applications such as XEmacs and Netscape which run in quasi-server
mode.

I need to have a way for my program to switch to a particular
FVWM page. I need to create a button on my application
that when clicked, will cause the current FVWM page
to be switched to the one to the right of my application's
page. Thus I need to know the best way to do in my
program what hot-keying to the right page does.

You can use the FvwmCommand module.  Just start the server in
fvwm's config file:

  AddToFunc InitFunction Module FvwmCommandS

After that you can call FvwmCommand from the command line to
execute any fvwm commands:

  # FvwmCommand "GotoPage 2 3"

(The quotes are necessary, otherwise the '2' and '3' will be interpreted
as separate commands).

I have this in my xmodmap (see man page for xmodmap command for
details):

  keycode 0x73 =  Super_L
  keycode 0x74 =  Super_R
  ...
  clear Mod4
  ...
  add    Mod4    = Super_L Super_R

This maps both keys to modifier '4'.  Use 'xkeycaps' to find
out the correct keycodes if 0x73 and 0x74 don't work for you
(try a '107 key PC keyboard' layout in xkeycaps).

Bye

The usual reason for 'mouse/key bindings stop working' problems
is that you have pressed num-lock, caps-lock or any other of
the locking modifier keys.  Pressing the offending key again
will solve the problem then.  The 2.3.x beta releases have a
command 'IgnoreModifiers' that can prevent this from the start
(but which is very inefficient due to the way X handles key
and mouse bindings) as well as a FAQ entry explaining how to
disable those keys completely.

If this is not your problem, please have a close look at the
mouse pointer when you move it over one of the broken title
buttons.  Usually you would get a small hand.  If this is
not the case, what cursor do you get?  The one you would get
ofer the title or perhaps one of the double arrows you
get with the mouse over the corners or border (which)?
In either case, please run the command

  # xwininfo -tree > xwininfo.out

click on the root window when asked for a target window.
Make sure you have a window with a unique name that has the
button problem and send me the name and the output of the
command.  BTW, do the buttons on all windows stop working
at once or only for some or one window(s)?

Bye

yes, it does. thanks. in fact, i was doing something like that already,
except that it didnt work for more than one menu because i was very stupidly
using the same function name in the "MissingSubmenuFunction" bit of the menu
definition! what an idiot, ah?

I have this in my config file:

  AddToFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
  + i piperead 'fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh '$0

  AddToMenu workmenu
  + MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
  ...
  + "root directory" popup / MENUPOS
  + home popup /home/luthien MENUPOS

With this I have two directory menus, one starting at / and one
starting at ~. The shell script fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh is
the predecessor of the perl scripts.  Within you will find a line
'ACTION=vi'. Replace 'vi' by any program you would like to run.
It's easy to modify the shell script to take the command as another
argument.  A similar script remembers the directory you last
opened.  To use it, put this in your config file:

  AddToMenu workmenu
  + BrowseMenu popup BrowseMenu MENUPOS

  AddToMenu BrowseMenu
  + DynamicPopupAction Piperead 'fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu'

The script looks similar.  Again replace 'vi' with any command you
like.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

  I asked this a while before, but didn't see an answer.

  Can someone explain in words of 2-3 syllables what exactly
MWMDecorMazmise, and the ToggledXXX button states actually /do/? There's
no real mention of them in the man., page, and even the archive doesn't
have much to say on the subject (even when they were committed).

The 'toggled' style applies if the window is maximized and
ithe button has 'MWMDecorMax', or if it is shaded and has
'MWMDecorShade' or if it is sticky and has 'MWMDecor<whatever>'
set.

  OK, then. Two questions:

  a) does this mean that the "one   of   the   ***MWMDecorMaximize***,  
MWMDecorShade   or" text in the man page is wrong? (Just "Max"?)

  b) what *should* the following do?

Style "*"  MWMDecor, MWMFunctions

AddToDecor Std  AddButtonStyle 2  \
         Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm  - MWMDecorMax \
         ToggledActiveUp    (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ToggledActiveDown  (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm)
AddToDecor Std  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMaximize


  I've also tried:

AddToDecor Std  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMax

By this, do you mean FvwmWinList or the built-in WindowList (menu)?
Using the test setup file quoted below, no icons are displayed in 
the FvwmWinList. (The icons are in the right path, because icons
do show up on the desktop when I minimize an xterm.) Also I can't
find any option in the FvwmWinList man page for turning on displaying
of icons. Maybe you can help?

Another problem with the FvwmWinList module: is using the Transient
option. When I enter in an FvwmConsole:

  Mouse 3 R A Module FvwmWinList

a window list appears on clicking the 3rd mousebutt in the root window,
however when I use

  Mouse 3 R A Module FvwmWinList Transient

nothing happens when clicking that button. I also tried -Transient,
transient
and -Transient, with the same result. Do you know what I'm doing wrong?

Finally: I'm trying to configure the pager. To set the desk-layout, one
uses
*FvwmPagerRows and ~Columns. But, how do you set the page layout of 
each desk?


Btw, I'm using fvwm2 version 2.3.10.

Jos van Riswick

Hi!

I'm (still) configuring my fvwm desktop. Right now I'm trying to get
the pager to do what I want. I'm faced with the following problem:
the entire workspace is divided up into separate desktops, and each 
desktop is divided up in pages. The desktops can be set using
*FvwmPagerRows and ~Columns, but how do you set the division
of a desktop into pages? I'd  like to work on one desktop, divided into
NxM pages. Is this possible to set explicitely?

Btw: my FvwmWinList still isn't displaying icons, and the Transient
argument doesn't work, anyone have any good advice regarding this?

best regards,

Jos van Riswick

Hi,

   [ I'm running fvwm-2.3.10 under RedHat Linux 6.0 and XFree86-3.3.3.1. ]

   I recently started to use WindowList as a simple icon manager.
   It suits me very well, because it's invisible until popped up,
   and so it does not clutter up my screen when I'm not using it.

   However, it's still not exactly what I want, due to the following:

   1) I want WindowList to show precisely those windows which are iconified,
      no more, no less.  If I use:

         WindowList OnlyIcons

      then it fails to list any iconified windows which have the
      Sticky or StaysOnTop styles.  On the other hand, if I use:

         WindowList OnlyIcons, Sticky, OnTop

      then it lists all of the Sticky and OnTop windows, even when
      they are not iconified.

      Is there some way I can tell WindowList to list *precisely* the
      iconified windows?

   2) I use highlighting to show which entry in the WindowList is
      currently selected.  But WindowList also puts a cursor on the
      selected item.  The cursor is unnecessary, it partially obscures
      the name of the icon, and it's just clutter.  Is there any way
      to remove the cursor from a WindowList?

      I guess I could define my own xpm file with an invisible cursor,
      but that seems like an awkward solution.  Might I instead propose
      a new option, of the form:

         WindowList NoCursor

   3) (... now I'm getting really picky! ...)
      I also dislike the numbering of items in the WindowList (0, 1, 2, ...);
      I would prefer not to see these numberss --- again, in order to
      reduce clutter.  Might I propose something like:

         WindowList NoNumber

      to show the items without any numbers?

   Thanks for any help that anyone can give with this.

   Best Wishes from Ireland!

Cheers, Joseph

Under "Style", this is in the fvwm2 man page:

          MiniIcon specifies a pixmap to  use  as  the  miniature
          icon  for the window.  This miniature icon can be drawn
          in a title-bar button (see  ButtonStyle),  and  can  be
          used by various fvwm modules (FvwmWinList, FvwmIconMan,
          and FvwmTaskBar). It takes the name of a pixmap  as  an
          argument.

So, if you  give your various windows "MiniIcons",  they will be shown
in either of the window lists (and anywhere else mini-icons are used).

Maybe someone else can help with your other questions.

Well, this is what I tried: I defined a mini icon for "xterm", and 
it works for the built in WindowList: here the mini icon is displayed,
but the mini icons are not displayed in the FvwmWinList... So I wonder 
if you have to tell FvwmWinList to do this, or should it do this by 
default?

Jos.

Hi

I am using a pager, with 4x3 desktops.
When I am using "Desktop" pager, I can use the right mouse button to
drag the focus between the different desktops.

When I go to "Work" pager, I have to first click on any desktop to get focus.
The windows from the "Desktop" pager follow in "Work" pager. Once I set the
focus on "Work", they disappear. This is true when I go back to "Desktop".
In the "Work" desktop, I cannot use my right mouse button to drag the focus
between different desktops.

How can I fix these 2 items? Pager focus and RMB drap in the 2nd desktop?

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean with 'focus' and 'Work'/'Desktop'
pager.  Can you rephrase that for complete idiots (like me)?  The answer
to your second question is:  You can't drag the viewport (= the visible
portion of your work space) to a different desktop.  The reason is that
per design different desktops are not linked in any way.  They each have
their own coordinate system.  Better think of them as stacked above each
other.

Bye

  OK, then. Two questions:

  a) does this mean that the "one   of   the   ***MWMDecorMaximize***,  
MWMDecorShade   or" text in the man page is wrong? (Just "Max"?)

  b) what *should* the following do?

Style "*"  MWMDecor, MWMFunctions

AddToDecor Std  AddButtonStyle 2  \
         Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm  - MWMDecorMax \
         ToggledActiveUp    (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ToggledActiveDown  (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm)
AddToDecor Std  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMaximize


  I've also tried:

AddToDecor Std  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMax

I was skeptical about the clarity of my first note. I knew I did not use
the fvwm lingo.

I have included a small gif file to better understand my setup.

This image shows my current desktop. On the FvwmButtons bar, I call the
FvwmPager module with a completely new Pager with the title "Work".
When I switch to "Work", the windows in "Desktop" follow into "Work".
I don't want windows in "Desktop" to follow into "Work".

Regarding my second question, I am not trying to drag the desktop. I want to
scroll to other viewports using RMB. It works fine in the "Desktop" pager but
not in "Work" Pager.

I hope it is a little bit more clear this time. :-)

No, I was just too lazy to type MWMDecorMaximize :)

Are you joking?  I'm sure no living person can tell you what
this is *supposed* to do :-)  The only thing I could do is to
try it out and tell you what it does.  Did I ever mention that
I'd love to nuke all this Decor/ButtonStyle/TitleStyle/BorderStyle
stuff and rewrite it from scratch with a decent syntax?

  Oh, I can *tell* you that :-/

  I suppose I'll have to try to wade through the code to figure out if it
/ought/ to do what I want (i.e., have one button xpm whlie maximised, and
another while minimised. Doesn't sound too tricky, but ...).

Is there another alternate site, where I can download
the fvwm 2.2 version?

The ftp.fvwm.org, site goes into a forever waiting state.
I experienced that yesterday as well as today.

Any pointers appreciated.

Make sure the URL you are using is:

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.2.2.tar.gz

Can you get a directory listing from the site?

for example, ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub

Are you supplying the correct userid "anonymous" (thats automatic
with a browser).  Have you configured your email address correctly?

The password is your email address, and it must be valid.

If you are on UNIX, do you have a .netrc entry for the site and
userid?  Is it correct?

Send us the output from command line ftp if you are still having
problems.

Keep your questions on the list.  You might get a better answer that way.

On command line,

Connected to sina.hpc.uh.edu.


Terminated

Hi

I have a few questions concerning the use of separate files
for configuring fvwm2.3.10. 

1) Is the scope of functions (AddToFunc) in files global, or 
   local to the file

2) And if I use M4 preprocessing, is this local a file, or 
   global: ie if I import a file using 

     FvwmM4 TheFile

   are the M4 definitions in the root file also applicable
   to TheFile, and can definitions made in TheFile be used
   in the root file?


regards


Jos.

I get the same effect.  The ftp just hangs there.  BTW, I had
a similar prolem with CVS commit lately.  It took many minutes
before something happened.  If I connect to ftp.fvwm.org with
netscape there is no problem at all.

Global.  Fvwm doesn't care where the commands come from.

They are local.  To get then in the main file you have to
process the whole config file with FvwmM4 and 'include' the
sub file with the proper M4 preprocessing directive (I don't
know how it's called).

Oops, hit C-c C-c in the wrong window!

This problem seems to be transient.
We may have to wait for Jason to read his mail for a real solution.

I had one  instance of a long wait  which I gave up  on followed by  a
command line success.

I suggest you keep trying or find another copy by doing a search
for fvwm-2.2.2.tar.gz.  I don't know of any mirror sites, but I
wouldn't be surprised to find all kinds of copies scattered about
the net.

Hi,

   Recently, I wrote:

   As a clarification, I guess I should have mentioned that I use the
   arrow keys, rather than the mouse, for navigation of the windowlist.
   Hence my wish not to have a cursor cluttering things up.

   Since these considerations actually apply more generally,
   to all menus in fact, perhaps a more appropriate suggestion
   would be the option:

      MenuStyle <menuname> NoCursor

   or perhaps (not such a nice solution):

      CursorStyle MENU -1

   where -1 denotes "no cursor".

You can already do the equivalent by specifying an xpm file that is
completely transparent. This works quite nicely:

/* XPM */
static char *no_cursor_xpm[] = {
/* width height ncolors cpp [x_hot y_hot] */
"1 1 1 1 0 0",
/* colors */
". s none m none c none",
/* pixels */
"."};

Is there any way to remove a title bar button once it's defined?

What I want to do is switch bewteen themes that use
3 buttons and themes that use 5 buttons, but once the
extra buttons are defined, I can't get rid of them 
without restarting fvwm2.

I don't know if you 'gnome based backdrop manager' actually
requires a gnome compliant window manager.  If it does, 1.24r
won't do.  Fvwm's 2.3.x beta realeases from version 2.3.4 and
up are (or try to be) gnome compliant.

The 'Button <n>' and 'NoButton <n>' styles do this, e.g.:

  Style * NoButton 5, NoButton 6

or

  Style * Button 5, Button 6

Hm, the precise answer would be 'FvwmToolTips', but somehow
I have the notion you are asking for already existing modules ;-)
There is no module for tool tips yet.  Some of the other modules
have some 'tool tip' functionality, notably FvwmPager
(the so called 'balloons') and FvwmTaskBar.

I am currently using a older fvwm2rc file, which I am trying to clean up.
One of the features, I am looking for is the color for sticky xterm/windows.

I found this in my rc file.

#
# Text and background color for the title bar of sticky windows
#
StickyColors    grey51 #60c080

However, it does not work and I have not found any reference to this option
in the documentation.

How can I set different colors to sticky terminals/windows?

Thank you in advance.

The "StickyColors" command comes from fvwm version 1 which is no
longer under development, and is not being supported as far as
I know.

With fvwm2, the feedback you get for sticky windows is a change in the
titlebar appearance.  (You get raised lines across the titlebar.)

If you have a version 1 rc file that you would like automatically converted
to version 2 syntax, there is "fvwmrc_convert" in the "utils" directory.

If you would like to make a clean start of it, you can just delete
your .fvwm2rc file, start fvwm2, and press the F1 key while the pointer
is on the root.  The "Setup Form" will create a configuration file for you.

Oops, sorry, this last  bit with the F1 key  is only available in  the

Hi!

I have a wish, to add to the wish list...

For the purpouse of customizing fvwm2 themes:

When drawing a tiled pixmap in the title bar, I'd like to
be able to have the option, to NOT draw the pixmap in the region where
the window title text is drawn (or maybe another pixmap.)

Maybe another one also: I'd like to be able to specify separate 
pixmaps for the four borders and the four handles. The pixmaps on 
the borders could be stretched, like the one in the titlebar. The 
handle pixmaps could be fixed. Together with the title and button 
pixmaps, this would increase the themizing possibilities a lot.
(Specifically, this would improve my BeOS theme a lot,
see http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/desktop.jpg)

Jos van Riswick

Sorry, that I didn't write earlier, but I was waiting for the error to reoccur, 
which it didn't so far. I didn't know about the effect of modifier keys though, 
so I guess it has been that all the time. Now that I know, I probably just 
don't press them anymore.
Anyway, thanks for your help,
Aron

Hi!

I'd like to make a 'simple' theme for fvwm2.3.10, which has solid black
borders. The only way to do this, (as far as I know), is to set the 
foreground color and the background color to 'black', (and use a colored
pixmap in the title and buttons, to set the background of those).
However,
the icon text then still gets displayed black on black. Is there a way
to set 
these colors independently?

Jos van Riswick

Hm, no syntax error.  Most likely the compiler is broken.  If I configure
with the HP-UX compiler but the use gcc to compile the output of the
preprocessing step I get no errors.

Then the HP compiler is probablly not an ansi C compiler but a k&r so just 
go with gcc.

The HPUX compiler isn't ANSI by default.  Someday, hopefully, they will
change that.  But for now, ANSI compliance only is granted when using
the proper compiler switch.

I find a great amount of success using a configure method like this:

    env CC=cc CFLAGS='-Ae -O' ./configure [--options]

Hope that helps.

Yes, thanks.  I wasn't aware that ANSI/K&R compatibility extends only
until the first function prototype is encountered :-)

GNU's autoconf stuff goes to great lengths to find the right switches to
enable ANSI-ification on the C compiler.  You shouldn't need to do
anything fancy to get this?

Is this with the native "cc" that comes free with the HP-UX system, or
with their unbundled "add-on" C compiler you have to buy separately?

Newer versions of autoconf do this quite well, but not every package one
finds on the net was built with the latest versions of autoconf.  If I
have problems building, forcing the '-Ae' switch is the first thing I
try.

This is with the non-free compiler.  The "bundled" compiler is very
noisy and annoying about its inability to become ANSI compliant, giving
a message like this when you try to use -Ae:

    (Bundled) cc: warning 480: The -A option is available only with the
	C/ANSI C product; ignored.

If you see this, then you have little choice but to go with gcc.

If you (or whoever owns the box you're trying to build on) has paid the
money for the HP ANSI C compiler, you might as well make use of it.. 
eh?  :)

hi

i just upgraded frpm 2.3.9 to 2.3.10, and everything is much much slower, 
especially the menu face and the title bars (i use a dgradient), FvwmPager 
does not keep the geometry i want to give it, rxvt's transparency behaves 
strangely (as i type, the text acquires a blue background). i've already gone 
back to 2.3.9 (everything is fine here!), because it was just umbearable. any 
idea what's going on?
