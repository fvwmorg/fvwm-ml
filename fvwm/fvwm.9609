right. the test above just rules that one out.
sorry, don't know the code, so I won't guess further.

only thing I can say is, that I had the problem that before I got UseOld to
work (ca. 0.39-41), every restart created new xclocks & xbiffs.
The old ones were _not_ mapped (also missing from the winlist, but still
running - ps x showed them), so that was somewhat different.
I don't think this is related, but I'm certainly not sure.

cheers,

Hmm, I've had problems with WABI on Solaris with mwm and raising windows
in general, but I guess these were WABI related.

Hmm, I hate to tell you, but the only thing I can point you to is UTSL
(use the source, Luke :-). Honestly, this sounds like a bug in fvwm,
which is not yet documented. If you have the time, please investige, if
not, hope that others will. Maybe you can provide a minimal X program
that exhibits the behaviour as a test case (not to me, I don't have time
at the moment to look into this :-(, to the developers.

Christopher,

Although a few people have responded to my earlier claim that
FvwmButtons doesn't work with libXpm.a version 3.4h saying that it works
just fine for them, I have to re-emphasize the possibility that you're
seeing the same problem I had.  The symptoms are absolutely identical. 
I reduced my configuration to the bare minimum, and it just refused to
start up.

Here is what I suggest:  re-build FvwmButtons with the "-g" switch
turned on.  Try running it.  When it crashes, it should leave a core
file in your root directory or thereabouts.  Use "dbx" or your favorite
debugger to get a stack trace (with "where" or "frame" or whatever the
command is).  If you see that the program is in some "Xpm" call when it
crashes, then you're probably seeing the same thing I did.  My next
suggestion would be to find an older copy of libXpm and re-build
FvwmButtons with that.

I never saw in your earlier mails what kind of configuration you're
running under, but I've got a copy of libXpm.a version 3.4a built for
a SUN Sparc running SunOS 4.1.x which I could uuencode and mail to you
if you have the same configuration.  Just let me know.

 I've tried to expand Bob Minowicz's CDE enviroment that he posted for the
RedHat Desktop Contest, but I have this annoying problem with adding another
icon to FvwmButtons. 
Basically what I did was to expand the left container from 4x3 to 5x3 to
include another icon, the 5th one. But that doesn't work, icons get pushed
over, etc.... But when I set it to 5x4 the icons fit fine, but the icons are
vertically too small, and you get a little annoying extra at the bottom.
Anyways, I'm including my FvwmButtons config file, take a look at it, see if
I'm doing something stupid.

Hello all:

About a half a year ago, I compiled fvwm 2.0.40 (I think, it was something
near that, perhaps .38 or .39) for SunOS 4.1.3.  Worked great.  However,
now I am on a Solaris machine (2.5), and FvwmButtons shows up as a
tiny rectangle in the top left corner instead of a rectangle that should
be about 200 times larger.

When I compiled for Solaris, I got these odd warnings:

I know that this has all been argued about before, but I'd like to bring it up
again. Sorry.

I am toying with adding a feature to FvwmIconMan where it would display 
miniature icons for each managed window, like the TaskBar does in fvwm95. 
The fvwm95 method, for those unfamiliar with it (as I was until last night)
is that there is a TitleIcon style option which specifies the mini icon used
in the titlebar (also perhaps cool. I think somebody submitted a patch to do
this for fvwm2?) and then fvwm passes this pixmap to any interested modules
which then do whatever. It seems to actually pass the pixmap and mask, not
just a filename, by the way.

I think that the main discussion about mini icons before came in the context
of sticking them in menus, ie, if you have a menu which lists a bunch of
programs to run, it would be nice to not have to specify by hand each icon.

So, here's my list of questions:

1. Exactly how does FvwmIconBox figure out which icons to display? I haven't
   done too much to figure this out, so feel free to just not answer me if
   it's obvious. But, I haven't been able to get it to use a particular icon
   for an xterm window. I tried using the *FvwmIconBox option to specify it
   directly, and also used Style to set the xterm icon to see if FvwmIconBox
   could magically figure it out. Neither works (using 2.0.43).

2. Is there any way to specify an icon for a window, without having that
   icon actually getting shown when a window gets iconified? If I use the
   Icon style to set an icon, then I get icons (which while obvious, is
   not what I want). I just want to be able to have FvwmIconMan get the
   icon without having to parse the .fvwm2rc file.

3. Is there any need for being able to specify both a big icon and a mini
   icon for a window? It seems clear that it could be potentially nice, but
   could also be work for little gain. Especially since I believe that we
   are about to run out of bits for Style options.

hmmm, a 'TinyIcon' Style could be used by a lot of features:
modules like FvwmWindowList, FvwmIconMan...
fvwm main code: Replace the '%my_pixmap.xpm%entry' in the menu
entries...
Anyway, I doubt that an official version will have this feature before
2.1.0. But, if someone made a patch...

[This is not a direct response to the original message, but rather some
ideas that I have been working with for some days. I finally got to
write them down.]

Take a look at
http://www.hp.com:80/xwindow/viaFrames/windowmgrs/cde.html, especially
"The CDE Action and Data Typing Service". It is possible to use this
scheme not only to specify icons for applications, but also for data
objects. It is also possible to bind together data types and the actions
to perform on them, sort of a advanced .mailcap definition database. 

I'm not saying that the current method of specifying application bound
icons in fvwm should be trashed, but rather that if fvwm moves into the
domain of desktop manager, it would _need_ an action and data typing
service. I'm not shure, but I believe that someone from the fvwm95 team
are working on a ms explorer lookalike. Would it be rude to ask for a
status brief? :)

I see many possible extensions to fvwm. What I would have done myself
(if time had permitted me to do so) would be to implement a menybar
system that an application could ask for and specify the structure of
through a corba/fresco like protocol. Much of the code is already there
in fvwm. It would also be possible to support NeXT and Mac like menus
since the application would only specify the menu structure, not what it
look like and where should be displayed (on top of the application
window would be the default).

In the same manner could an application ask for that stylish diagonal
resize handle at the lower right that Win95 has, if people like that
kind of decoration.

FvwmWindowList has the MiniIcons in Fvwm95, and other features I added.
If there was a patch for MiniIcons in Fvwm2, I could easily addapt the
code. Is there such a patch?

This has to do with "InitFunction" etc. StartupStuff() seems to be
excluded from the fvwm-2.0.43 release due to problems with a
FvwmM4/Cpp startup. The problem is this:

The commands retreived from a module (In this case FvwmM4/Cpp) is
not handled until the HandleEvents() loop is entered. This delays
the definition for "InitFunction" which will therefore be nil when
StartupStuff() is called.

Possible solutions:
1) Create a way to call a module synchroneously. I.e. start it up,
   and dispatch all the commands from it till it dies.
2) Skip the "InitFunction"/"RestartFunction" functionality all
   together and create a way to run commands within a conditional
   construct like 'If $mode=3D"init" then...'.
3) Skip FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp as external (asynchroneous) modules and
   make them internal (again) instead. BTW. It would be nice to be
   able to decide at compiletime to have a module internal or
   external...

It is indeed nice to have m4 functionality also in the definitions of
what is to happen at startup time. For instance arithmetic operations
could decide how to center certain modules etc.

I'm sorry if this matter has been discussed before.

Here's my take on this. I've only thought about it for five minutes, but
it seems potentially cool. I admit that it seems potentially unmanagable
as well.

If we did go to having multiple icon paths, then we would not be limited to
just one or two kinds of icons. It wouldn't be hard to enable an arbitrary
number of icon paths (like PixmapPath1, PixmapPath2, etc) and then whenever
you ask for an icon, you could just specify which path you want it from. So,
"%xterm.xpm%" could just mean grab it from the first path, and "%xterm.xpm 2%"
could be the xterm.xpm in either PixmapPath2. I'm ignoring the
distinction between IconPath and PixmapPath for now.

This has the advantage that one could have three (or more) icons for
each window (small for titlebar, medium for FvwmButtons, large for on
the desktop), without changing much code in fvwm. It would probably
require a similar amount of code as a spefic TitleIcon, but be more
general. It also wouldn't require a seperate style. We could just use
the current Icon style, but it would create an array of icons associate
with a window, not just one.

The tricky part is if we want to have fvwm automatically figure out
which icon it wants (1 for desktop, 2 for in the titlebar) then we would
have to have some well known naming scheme. For this, actual names would
be better than integers (maybe: "PixmapPath default /usr/X11R6/pixmaps")
but now we require more code in fvwm.

Perhaps this would be another use for that module which just stores
extra state for windows that I mentioned a week or so ago (I haven't
forgot about that Barry, if you're reading this. I'm just polishing up
my python skills before I start).

This is the Debian GNU prepackged source file.

Had same problem with 2.0.42 Beta that I got source to myself.

Extra comment:

The priority of this is kinda low, I admit.

Extra Ideas:

Hey, here's an idea for FvwmBackerDesk:
to cache the root background for each desk so the command
doesn't have to be run each time.  And then specify an update
interval.

(Like xearth needs updating every so often since it shows the sun's
current position, but xv only shows this one boy that doesn't change
much; perhaps I should make it fetch other boys -- now that's an idea)

Addendum:

If you care, my titles for the desks are:
0-System (so the red means problem as if in Star Trek or something);
1-Research (like WWW stuff -- thus the earth picture); 2-Applications
(so it gets the most soothing color); 3-Play (so that's where the boy
comes in)

Excuse:

I searched the entire archives (transfering 9MB of uncompressed files
seemed silly and took a while on my ISP's T1s), and all I found is
others with the same problem, no real solutions, unless the solution
people didn't include the string backer in their reply (how can I
thread those?  Oh yeah ... nn) Ok ... and I also realized that I could
try the dynamic FvwmBackerDesk stuff that people have posted but I
don't really need that ...

[much complicated stuff deleted]

currently, we seem to have a movement towards a prefix for mini icons:
e.g: mini.move.xpm. That makes the pixmap directory rather crowded.

perhaps convert the mini. to a mini/

or: (I'd like this one most)
hierarchy below PixmapPath:
	PixmapPath/64x64/
	PixmapPath/32x32/
	PixmapPath/16x16/
and some sort of 

IconDirectory 64x64
MiniIconDirectory 16x16

in .fvwm2rc, to choose, which icons to use where. (I prefer smaller icons
than others, even on a BIG screen)

I tried the leftmenus
(#define LEFT_MENUS im menus.c)

menus pop up left, if you hit the triange first.
If you have larger icons in the menu, and you point the mouse _below_ the
triangle, menus still pop up right.

Also, it looks somewhat strange, that the right side of the left menu is
flush with the left side of the previous menu.
If the menu has enough space on the right side, it overlaps about a quarter
to a half of the original window, which look _much_ better.
(The amount of overlap depends on mouse pos, the menu is apparently
centered around mouse position, when opened)

I'd like to have the following changes to the triangles in menus: 
	left, if there's not much (1/2 the new popup or simply guess)
		space on the right.
	centered vertically (i.e: at the same height as the text)

which oneof the patches out there comes closest ?

Another idea: if no "TinyIcon" style is provided the modules could use
mini.ICON as default, where "ICON" is the icon specified with the
"Icon" style.

Hi,

I have been greatly enjoying fvwm 2.0.43.  I have a few questions:

1) I believe there is a bug in the multiple desktops.  I have switched to
using only a single desktop configured to be 3x2.  Whenever I started a
FrameViewer program, it would plop the window on the second desktop (which
I can not get to).  I had to move the window from the program list in
tkGoodStuff to the correct pager client window in order to see the window. 
I tracked the problem down to an extra line in FvwmBacker that specified a
command for the second desktop (and I do not even use FvwmBacker).  Once I
removed that line, the problem quit.  This might be a problem for
inexperienced fvwm users once the program is released (which I am assuming
would increase the number of people using it).  Just thought you might like
to know.

2) Where is there any documentation on the .fvwm2rc file options and a
specification for creating modules(ie. module communications with fvwm)?  I
have scanned all of the fvwm WEB sites, but can only find documentation for
fvwm 1.24r.

3) I am assuming that fvwm and modules communications is based on pipes
(since fvwm has to start the program).  Would it not be better to base it
on tcp/ip socket communications.  That way modules could be written that
reside on a different system so not to tie up resources on the current
system (a form of distributive processing. In a slow network, it would slow
down fvwm most likely though).  A socket based approach would be easier to
program from some languages (ie. tcl/tk would not need extensions since it
can work with sockets directly.  Java modules would then be a snap).  This
question comes from complete ignorance to how it works, so please ignore if
it is totally abserd (but let me know where to find proper documentation).

Thank you so much for your time and attention.

Hello Everyone,

This is my first posting to the list (I've never used one before)
so I hope I'm doing it right.

I'm using FVWM-2 (I don't know what version though, how do you do
 that?) and I can't seem to get a pixmap to come up on Button 3 
of the menu bar.  I can only get a blank rectangle (the regular
style of button definition works fine).  The pixmap path is set
correctly. The command looks like:

ButtonStyle 3 Pixmap mini-ball.xpm mini-bball.xpm

Any ideas?

Pixmaps work in my Popups no problem.

Using Fvwm Version 2.0.43 I find my icons dropped right where the window
was. I could swear I had it already working that my icons get lined up at
the botton, but even after trying hard I cannot find any problems on what
I screwed up here or any hints in the docs on how to control icon
placement behavior. 

Thanks for help.

Hello Everyone,

This is my first posting to the list (I've never used one before)
so I hope I'm doing it right.

I'm using FVWM-2 (I don't know what version though, how do you do
 that?) and I can't seem to get a pixmap to come up on Button 3 
of the menu bar.  I can only get a blank rectangle (the regular
style of button definition works fine).  The pixmap path is set
correctly. The command looks like:

ButtonStyle 3 Pixmap mini-ball.xpm mini-bball.xpm

Any ideas?

Pixmaps work in my Popups no problem.

Hmm, I got your mail twice now, so there is some improvement possible,
but I guess the basics worked out well :-)

There comes some excellent, hmm, ok there comes some documentation with
fvwm-2, which you might want to read. The manpages tell you a lot about
commandline arguments, e.g. searching the man page fvwm2 for version
yields:

     -version
          Print the version of fvwm to stderr.

thus fvwm -version will get you the version number :-)

A good idea might be, to look at other people's fvwm2rc. There is an
archive somewhere that contains some:

# Apparantly, you can retrieve sample .fvwmrc's from 
#       ftp://ftp.best.com/pub/tdgilman/Fvwmrcs

is in the first lines of my fvwmrc.

If you see how it works for other people, it might be easier for you to
figure out how to do it for your configuration.
That's how I did it.

Hi,

I cannot compile fvwm2.042 on a Solaris system. I have noticed that this
has been a problem for other people as well and yet the provided
solutions did not work in my case. First, some background:

compiler:	gcc
assembler:	gnu as
linker:		gnu ld
xmp:		turned off (I do not have it yet)
system:		Ultra 1
OS:		Solaris 2.51

I modified the Fvwm.tmpl so that *everything* that has to do with fvwm
will be installed under /apps/fvwm2.042.

Problems:

[1]	The -xF option upsets gcc; I've read somewhere that this is not 	
fatal; I can also undefine it from the command line
[2]	There is some assembler option that has the characters 92 in it. 	
The assembler called by gcc does not understand this. Again, I
	had it undefined from the command line.
[3]	After the libfvwm.a file has been created, the very first time 			it
is being referenced in a link statement, the compiling fails
	due to not finding symbols.

Possible explanations:

[1]	Did I mess up the system by forcing everything under /apps/...
[2]	Is imake not configured properly. I don't really know much about
<	imake other than the fact that it creates makefiles for X
	applications. No customization has been made on this machine
	as far as imake is concerned.
[3]	???

BTW, I tried many versions (1.x and 2.x) of this package and none of
them worked. 

Thanks for any help.

I am new to fvwm 2.X, and noticed that the cursor function from 1.24r
has been "obsoleted".  I am just wondering if something else has taken
over the task, or if cursor configuration is now impossible.  (I don't
like the default cursor configuration.)

Hi,

There is an odd interaction between resize stick & paging.

I wanted to resize a sticky perfmeter window:

I select resize from the root window menu (no decorations on my
perfmeters).

When dragging the lower left border of the perfmeter into the lower left
border of the page (lower middle page of my 4x2 desktop), I release the
button, just while the page flips.

Then the window is gone.

Not on any page, of the desktop any more (I use only one desktop)

Simply not mapped.

The process is still there and must be killed.

If I release the button AFTER the pageflip, everything is fine (not
exactly, as I wanted the window to stay on that page, and not to span over
two pages, but well, it's still there at least).

Ok, so I changed my .fvwm2rc for perfmeters to be seen in the windowlist:

When I select the "missing" perfmeter, I get warped to the next (right)
page. 

Strange. nothing's there.
I retry.
I get warped to the next page.

And so on, till I'm at the rightmost page.

A closer look at the windowlist reveals: position: +1400-74


It's now a sticky window with position on "right page" (i.e:
screenxsize+xxx), so it's always just on the _next_ page.

Always just one page away, but forever unreachable.
Unless I could do some "unstick -> select from windowlist" :-(

BTW: Chuck, have you decided on my windowlist/menu changes yet?

so I got 2 possible fixes: read comments for more info.

I'm constantly driven off my mouse pad, since I tend to start menus in the
bottom of the screen (only tiny patches of root window left).

It's driving me crazy, especially since I'm trapped with an optical
sun-mouse, where you can't use a bigger mousepad.

Who rejects to turning the menu's mouse-warping off ?

I have no strong  opinion on whether  the pointer  should warp  to the
menu title when  the menu doesn't  fit, however, remember, when  using
"mwm" menus, this  could create the  situation  that you would want  2
menus to pop up with the first click.

Personally, I recommend  finding 3 keys  on the  keyboard you are  not
using.  (On my Sun 4 keyboard, I use "=",  "/". and "*" on the numeric
pad).  I bind them the same as the 3 mouse buttons on the root window.
(Except that they are active all the time, not just on the root.)

I also recommend using "&"  in menus to define hot  keys for most menu
operations.

Once you start operating the menus thru  the keyboard, your mouse will
start gathering dust.  Keyboard operation of  the menus is hundreds of
times faster than using the mouse.

Hmm, I compiled 2.043 on a solaris 2.4 machine without hickups. Only a
two single warnings about const being removed/ignored or sth. like this. 
SunOS went fine as well.

Oops, what xmp? you ment xpm? :-)

Wow, not bad :-) Well, I happen to have such a machine available as well
and I tried to compile fvwm on it as well for speed reasons :-) I tried
xmkmf -a
make
but I got lots of errors during the compile. Then I tried the following:
rsh Solaris-2.4 xmkmf -a
make
and things went great. Lesson learned: The imake stuff isn't properly
set up on our Solaris-2.5 Ultra machine. Compiling an already configured
source tree works fine. I recommend to test the stuff at your site as
well :-)

Hmm, then this will definitely not work. Try configuring on a host where
the imake stuff is setup properly. You can still compile on the
Ultra-machine of the libs and the include files are at the right places,
i.e. at the same place which is configured on the machine you run the
xmkmf on. 

You have two other ways out:
configure the imake stuff properly, which is not that difficult, but
takes a lot of time.
compile it on another solaris machine and just install the stuff on the
ultra machine.

I am running fvwm 1.0 on a Linux 1.2.8 box (a.out) with gcc 2.7.2 (ELF). 
Every time I start up fvwm my GoodStuff bar doesn't show.  When I quit xinit
altogether I see an error saying 'using light C image use real instead.'  I
have libXpm.so.4.2 which is a Linux/i386 demand paged executable.  Could this
be the problem?  Any help is appreciated.

>> Who rejects to turning the menu's mouse-warping off ?

The Motif style guide says that mouse-warping should never happen unless a
user sets an option requesting the warp.  I'm not sure I agree that the
default should always be no-warp, but I think that it's generally a good
idea to give the user the option.

if this is a poll, count me in for not warping by default but I also support
making it an option, so the user can choose if she want's to.

Hello,

I'm trying to put the pager in a button. I've tried this:

*FvwmButtonsFore Black
*FvwmButtonsBack #c0c0c0
*FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmButtonsGeometry 1124x60-1-1
*FvwmButtonsRows 1

*FvwmButtons xclock  clock.xpm   Swallow "xclock" Exec xclock -bg \#c3c3c3 
	-geometry -1500-1500 -padding 0 &

# etc.

*FvwmButtons(2x1) - whatever SwallowModule "FvwmPager" FvwmPager 0 0

*FvwmPagerBack grey60
*FvwmPagerFore black
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmPagerHilight #c0c0c0
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 50
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1-1
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Desktop
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8


But the Pager is then giant. So, I made this change:

*FvwmPagerGeometry 120x58-1-1

Now the pager is almost in the right place, but it is not in a button.
It simply overlaps the location where the button would be.

What can I do?

This sounds like an interesting module. However, the installation 
instructions ask me to alter makefile.h, which I don't have in
fvwm-2.0.43. 

Is there an alternative?

You must not specify the offsets. Try

*FvwmPagerGeometry 120x58

X geometry works as follows:
(size in x direction)x(size in y direction)+/-(offset from right or left
border)+/-(offset from top or bottom)

The pager just happens to be in the correct place, because your buttons
also specify the same x/y offsets. Leaving the offsets out will
(hopefully :-) do the trick.

The Makefiles for fvwm-2.0.42 and 2.0.43 both have the option -pipe in them.

For acc V2.0, the manual states it is an obsolete option.
For acc V3.0, it is NOT an option, and it tries to pass it on to the
linker/loader -- which results in an error.

Please remove -pipe from the CCOPTIONS for acc.

I've tried the following:

Key Sys_Req      A      A       Popup "RootMenu"
Key Scroll_Lock  A      A       Popup "Window-Ops"
Key Pause        A      A       Module FvwmWinList

It doesn't work. I am only able to bind F-keys, tab, arrows..

I use fvwm 2.43, XFree 3.1.2F, linux-intel 2.0.18.



All The Best,
 Marco

Huh?  There aren't any Makefiles in fvwm-2.0.4(2|3):

You generate the Makefile using xmkmf, which uses the Imake configuration

You should send that to your system administrator or whoever configured

Hi,

My problem is still not solved and I have reports from someone that it
also occurs under Solaris 2.5. 

The problem is this: When the X server is killed or crashes, fvwm2
as well as FvwmButtons continues to run and both sit there and eat
all CPU time they can get.

I think this is a serious problem and really should be fixed. Apart
from that it is rather annoying for me due to my special X setup which
just kills the X server when logging out and fvwm2 and FvwmButtons
need to be killed manually after logging out. 

I've already made two modifications as suggested in this list. I've
changed the DeadPipe routine in module.c like this: 

void DeadPipe(int nonsense)
{
  struct stat buf;
  if (fstat(XConnectionNumber(dpy), &buf) == -1) exit(1);
  signal(SIGPIPE, DeadPipe);
}

Likewise I've changed the DeadPipe routine in FvwmButtons.

Well. It does not work. Same problem.

Does anyone know a cure for that? I think fvwm is not ready for version
2.1 before this problem is solved.

Thanks -- Tom

Hi!

This simple question has been asked several times before, I'm sure, 
but I ask it again: Is it possible to turn the virtual desktop 
feature off? I don't want the scrolling when I'm closing up to
the edges. It annoys me. I don't use the pager and has the following
definitions in my .fvwmrc file:
  PagerDefault 0
  DeskTopScale 0
I'm currently using fvwm version 1 (I'm not sure about the patch level)

With regards Per Bjoerlo

Any smooth scrolling at the edge of the screen is a function of your X
server, not of the window manager.  Thus any solution will not involve
FVWM.  The answer is specific to your X server and since you didn't specify
which one you're running I can't solve your problem.

If you're running XFree86, just change the or get rid of the

Unless of course he means that he really doesn't want to use the
virtual desktop features of fvwm, in which case he should either make
the DesktopSize be 1x1 or use the version 1.xx command TogglePaging to
turn off paging from his .fvwmrc file.

Is this a true statement?  What about EdgeScroll and EdgeResistance.  
Those switches aren't dependant on the X server.  

For the answer to the original question, look in the manual pages for 
fvwm on EdgeScroll and EdgeResistance.  That will effectively "turn off" 
the scrolling.

Hi,

I cant seem to find anything about circulating windows in FVWM (2.xx)

The man page mentions CirculateSkip as a Style option but no CirculateUp
or circulate-up etc functions seem to work.

Is there a way to bind a key to circulate (a subset of) windows in FVWM?

Thanks in advance,

Patrick Sansom

I don't have a linux system handy, but on a Sun type 4 keyboard:

  Key Label    Keysym
  =========    ======
  Sys_Req:     Don't have a key with this label, but between
               Scroll Lock and Pause, I have PrSc which is "Print".
  Scroll_Lock: F32
  Pause:       F21

You wan't to get and  use "xkeycaps". You  need to know the keysym the
key generates.  If for some reason you can't  get xkeycaps, "xev" is a
poor substitute.

Happy keyboarding.

Howdy all,

Just wanted to let you all know that I'm still alive, and that 2.1 is
nearing completion, although it's going extremely slowly right now due
to my already taxed 'free time' becoming almost nil over the past
month or two.

That's also why I haven't really said much on the lists lately, so I
apologize if I have failed to answer any questions or participate in
various discussions lately.  I will try to get to them, belatedly.

I'm going to try and make some more time for fvwm over the next couple
of weeks to try and get 2.1 out there finially.  Not every bug will be
fixed, of course, since that's an impossible task...

Chuck

I hadn't followed up on my earlier postings on this since I was
doing some testing (and have also been busy on the things I'm
paid for <grin>). It turns out that the problem with FvwmButtons
looping is more likely the fact that it was doing Xlib calls in
the signal handler, which is supposed to be illegal. I've changed
it to just set a flag, which would force exit from the main loop
and then do the cleaup, but it doesn't seem to work properly yet
(swallowed programs get left running on a restart).

Based on this, I suspect your problem may not be the signal handler.
What I suggest you do is break into the looping process(es) with your
debugger, get the call stack, and post it to the list. We can proceed
from there.

I'll post the change to FvwmButtons when I'm sure it works okay.

Sounds like the right idea though.  I'll have to browse through that

Good idea, although where it's actually looping may not have anything
to do with how it got there.

Ok.

i am interested in adding the ability to restart the window
manager from an administration tool that i'm working on.

is it possible to hook into that function?  i am not too
familiar with the actual fvwm code, but if it is reasonable
to do this, i'll learn whatever i need to.

thanks!

Currently sending a SIGUSR1 to fvwm (version 1.xx or 2.xx) will cause
it to restart.  That's probably your best bet.

After a days worth of work getting fvwm to compile on our
Data General AViiON 400's I've run into a problem that I
can't seem to get solved.  I've run into this problem with
installing fvwm and the libXpm lib.  The problem is after
compiling I'll type in 'make install' and I get the following:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
gis1:/home/tocrensh/temp/xpm-3.4g> make install
installing in ./lib...
        .././util/scripts/bsdinst.sh -c -m 0664 libXpm.a /usr/lib
UX:sh (/bin/sh): ERROR: .././util/scripts/bsdinst.sh: Not found
*** Error code 1

Stop.
*** Error code 1

Stop.
gis1:/home/tocrensh/temp/xpm-3.4g>
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I can see that install isn't finding bsdinst.sh.  That's because
on our DG's bsdinst.sh is in: /usr/opt/X11/bin/bsdinst.sh and has a
symbolic link from /usr/bin/X11/bsdinst.sh. Both fvwm and the libXpm
are compiling nicely.  But I can't get the make install to work.  Can
anyone help me out with this one?

greetings,
i'm attempting to achieve said goal, but so far no deal...

i've tried putting the directive:
	AutoRaise -1
in the .fvwm2rc file
to which i get:
	fvwm: No such module /usr/local/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 AutoRaise

i've also tried:
	*AutoRaise:                     false
in my .Xdefaults file, but again, to no avail

i start my windows up with the 'xinit' directive,
and in the .xinitrc file i startup 'fvwm2'

now what?  i'm at a loss

style "*" AutoRaise -1
also fails....

much obliged

I'm not sure what your problem is but the AutoRaise module is located here:
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmAuto

This program can only be called from the fvwm2rc file like this:
Module  FvwmAuto 500

Hi:

I tried to compile fvwm2 and fvwm95-2 for my SunOS-4.1.3 and haven't 
been successful.  The problem was mostly with it trying to install stuff
in standard directories where I do not have access (dont have root) etc...

Anyway, I think I have spent as much time as I could on it and would 
appreciate if any one could point me to compiled binaries for the above 
mentioned OS.

Thanks.

Hi Grant,

Thanks for your reply.

O.K. I had a 1 hour debugging session this morning before I had to do
what I get paid for :-)

1.) FVWM2 didn't always loop when exiting X. Sometimes I dumped core
    as well. I got the following traceback for that:

    (gdb) r
    Starting program: /home/users/tom/sources/fvwm-2.0.43/fvwm/fvwm2
    X connection to finwal01:0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

    #13 0x12001ebd0 in main (argc=1, argv=0x11ffff9a8) at fvwm.c:447
    (gdb)

    The reason whas, that I had an "ExitFunction" defined which was
    supposed to kill FvwmButton. I saw this in a posting in the list
    and though it might be good idea. Actually when the ExitFunction
    was defined, ExecuteFunction is called which in turn makes some
    X calls again which dump core since the connection is already
    broken.

2.) Now for the looping problem. As expected, I get a SIGPIPE when X
    is killed. When I execute the SIGPIPE Handler with "signal 13"
    (13 = SIGPIPE) I found that this:

           struct stat buf;
           if (fstat(XConnectionNumber(dpy), &buf) == -1) exit(1);

    is not working! The program does not exit. Instead:

           signal(SIGPIPE, DeadPipe);

    is executed and the program continues. 

    Now the program loops and eats cpu time. When I interrupt it with
    the debugger I get the following traceback:

    (gdb) bt
    #0  0x3ff80481398 in _XFlush ()
    #1  0x3ff80485fd4 in _XData32 ()

    #4  0x120034408 in MoveViewport (newx=0, newy=0, grab=0) at virtual.c:393
    #5  0x1200205b0 in Done (restart=0, command=0x0) at fvwm.c:1071
    #6  0x120020948 in CatchFatal (dpy=0x140008000) at fvwm.c:1149
    #7  0x3ff80485cf4 in _XIOError ()
    #8  0x3ff80481614 in _XFlush ()
    #9  0x3ff804835fc in _XReply ()
    warning: Hit heuristic-fence-post without finding
    warning: enclosing function for address 0x4a40537248019600

    Apparently "CatchFatal" is correctly called but in turn calls
    X functions and ends up in XFlush which sits there and loops.
    XFlush never returns.

    Examining the source reveals that the 'Done' routine does:

    #ifndef NON_VIRTUAL
       MoveViewport(0,0,False);
    #endif

    I don't know what this is for but it is definately the reason
    for the troubles.

So all in all I come to the following conclusions:

    a.) ExitFunctions are not good !! The can cause fvwm2 to dump core
        when exiting!
    b.) The MoveViewPort call in 'Done' is the reason for the troubles.

I don't have too much insight in fvwm to decide if its appropriate just
to remove this call from the 'Done' routine.

So how can we solve the problem?

Thanks for your help everybody -- Tom

you should be able to use FvwmPipe by ettrich@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de

echo "Restart" >~/.fvwmpipe.in

or sth. like that.
FvwmPipe will be in the 2.1 extras directory, as chuck said.

or try

No problem, you don't need to be root to install fvwm.
Just read the INSTALL document _*CAREFULLY*_!!!
I am citing INSTALL:

First examine configure.h and Fvwm.tmpl and change any of the defaults

Now I am citing Fvwm.tmpl:

/* Where do you want the fvwm binaries installed. */
#define FvwmBinDir /tools/fvwm-2.0.43/bin

/* Where do you want the fvwm modules installed. */
#define FvwmDir /tools/fvwm-2.0.43/modules

/* Where do you want the fvwm libraries installed. */
#define FvwmLibDir /tools/fvwm-2.0.43/lib

/* Where do you want the fvwm man pages installed. */
#define FvwmManPath /tools/fvwm-2.0.43/man
#define FvwmManSuffix 1

Just change these directories to somewhere you have write access to, e.g. 
your homedirectory.

I have compiled binaries for SunOS and Solaris available, but I don't know where
to put them. But I am sure you can do it better yourself. It's really easy :-)

Hmm, first of all, you can always do it by hand :-) Instlal doesn't do
much, just set the permissions like you want, and group and ownership
:-)

I don't know how xpm configures, but if it uses xmkmf (imake), then your
imake setup ist wrong. It should state, where bsdinst can be found.

But anyway, why not either change the makefile to use the bsdinst with
the proper path, or just copy the bsdinst temporarily to the place that
make searches.

The last and proper solution would be to fix your imake-setup, if xpm
uses imake. You will run into the same problem for every X program that
uses imake and bsdinst to install itself. If xpm doesn't use imake, then
it's configuration is wrong :-)

The 'fstat' code was just a stab in the dark.

It should be possible to just remove the 'Done' and replace it with exit(1);
for now. The problem in your case appears to be that it is not permissable
to call X functions from the X fatal I/O error handler.

The XLib Reference Manual (for 'R5) says nothing about calling X functions
from the fatal error handler; it does say it isn't permissable to call them
from the regular error handler. Obviously, though, making X calls from the
fatal error handler is a Bad Thing.

>From an inspection of the code, it appears the only safe thing from Done()
that could be invoked in the fatal I/O error handler is ClosePipes().

This means, by the way, that the ExitFunction won't get invoked on a server
shutdown, unless some way of preventing all X calls during its operation can
be put in place.

The SIGSEGV in the ExitFunction may be the same problem.

I am attaching a patch to fvwm.c which changes the CatchFatal to call
ClosePipes() and exit(1), and the patch FvwmButtons which changes the signal
handling.

Chuck may have more to say on this, of course.

Thanks for the patch. I'll apply it and see if it works. I hope that
a final solution for the problem (perhaps with ExitFunction being called
even on a server shutdown) will be in 2.1.

Thanks again -- Tom

I just noticed that the FvwmButtons patch is bad. The attached patch should
be used instead; or, change line 204 in the patched FvwmButtons.c from
   running = 1;
to
   running = 0;

Sorry about that.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The attached patch contains all of the changes/patches I've made to fvwm
2.0.43. (I'm sending this since I'm not sure I sent in all of the changes
before).

The changes in this patch:
   * FvwmButtons
      parse.c       Change to parse old-style SwallowModule command (tested)
      FvwmButtons.c Change to remove XLib calls from signal handler (part
                    tested)
   * FvwmConsole
      FCtest.c      Fixes to prevent memory corruption (tested)
   
   * fvwm
      placement.c   Change to allow RandomPlacement for transient windows
                    (dialogs) (tested)
      fvwm.c        Change to remove X calls from the X fatal I/O error
                    handler (needs to be tested on Digital Unix)

Pardon my ignorance, but I've not followed the mailings
for a few months.

At one time, there were two versions of FvwmButtons.
It looks as if there is really only one version now,
which looks to correspond to the changes added to
the new FvwmButtons.  It seems to accept both the
old form of commands and what was the new form in the
new Buttons module.

Is this correct, or am I missing anything...Just
trying to clarify the current state of business.

Yup - RTFM.  Look for the IconBox Style option (if you are referring
to fvwm 2.xx, otherwise look for the IconBox standalone function) in
the fvwm[2].man page.  It's used to specify a region of the screen to
place icons in.

You are correct, sir.  The FvwmButtons is a new version currently (and
the old version I renamed to be FvwmGoodStuff and put it in the extras
directory, in case anyone really only wanted to run that version).

It does usually read the old style config ok, as well.

If nothing else out of that patch, this change to fvwm.c will almost
certainly be in 2.1.

As for the other parts of the patch, I haven't really looked them over
yet, but the FvwmButtons fixes will probably be in there too.  I got a
new version of FvwmConsole, so I'll have to compare your patch against
it and merge it in if necessary.

Hmm. My fvwm-2.0.43.tar.gz untarred to have fvwm-2.0.43/extras/FvwmConsole
instead. I must have a special version.

I couldn't figure out how to compile FvwmConsole, since it (INSTALL) asks me
to alter fvwm/makefiles.h, which I do not have.

Since you've made a patch, I imagine you must know. How do I compile
FvwmConsole?

Oops. I forgot I moved the directory from extras to modules, and changed
the top-level generated Makefile to include it. I forget whether that was
all that was necessary. (You could also change the Imakefile.)

I'm trying to use the TitleStyle controls with
2.0.43, as follows:

TitleStyle ActiveUp (Pixmap /home/cwolf/Icons/paw.xpm)

This works fine, but if I try the example given in the
man page:

TitleStyle ActiveUp (Pixmap /home/cwolf/Icons/paw.xpm -- Bottom Left)

it fails!  No icon ever appears.  I also have an ActiveDown setting which works
(beacause I don't use the -- stuff).  No manner of options after the --
seems to get it to work.

Anyone know why?

I'll look into this when I get a chance.  Are you using tbp4?

I'd prefer that questions regarding the patch are emailed to me
direclty since it is not part of Fvwm.

It seems to have worked for me. After installing readline, I moved
FvwmConsole into modules, mistakenly changed BINDIR in
FvwmConsole/Makefile to /usr/openwin/bin, ran all of the makes, and
then moved /usr/oepnwin/bin/FvwmConsole* to /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fvwm2.

Thanks.

Okay Chris, 

Hmm... I said I thought this shouldn't be discussed on the list but
just to followup the last message here is a fix :).  Until I get time
to make a new patch, please check it out (I'm pretty certain this
fixes it, it was a pretty dumb on my part).

Thanks for noting this problem.

Thanks to the help of Guenther Grau I was able to get FVWM 2.0.42
to install on our Data General AViiON systems.  It's working fine
but the differances between 1.x and 2.0.42 are enough to cause me
some problems.

How the heck to I get the frame or border color to change to what
I want instead of the purple it is now?  I've looked in my .fvwmrc
and can't find anything there to change it.  I also have the FVWM
faq and am unable to find what I need there.  Remember, this is
2.0.42 and the 1.x command doesn't work.

Hello,

I am trying to compile on my Sun UltraSparc ( uname -a gives:
	SunOS scuba 5.5 Generic_103093-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1).  I do not
have root access on the machine.  I have done the following to attempt
to get it to compile.






1. remove the first 4 lines and paste in the following

/*#define FVWMDIR     "/usr/lib/X11/fvwm"*/
#define FVWMDIR        "/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm"
#define FVWM_ICONDIR   "/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm/include/X11/bitmaps:/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm/include/X11/pixmaps"
#define FVWMRC         "/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm/system.fvwmrc"

2. Change line 16 and 17 to:

#define FVWM_BIN_DIR BINDIR=/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm/bin/
/*#define FVWM_BIN_DIR BINDIR=/usr/bin/X11/*

I cannot get this to compile without XPM support so I am downloaded them
from ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/xpm-3.4h.tar.gz


3. Change line 58 to:
#define XPM                      
/*  linker flags needed to locate and link in the Xpm library, if you
use it */
#define XPMLIBRARY -L/coastal/scuba1/wilson/fvwm/xpm-3.4h/lib -lXpm



4.  Add gcc to path



execute the following commands

	xmkmf

at this point I get the following error:


>mv Makefile Makefile.bak
>imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config
>"Imakefile.c", line 4: Can't find include file Imake.tmpl
>imake: Exit code 2.  Stop.


Any help is greatly appreciated.  I am really tired of the ridiculously
ugly window manager at work, and would like the same environment that I
have on my Linux box at home.  Please email me directly as I do not
subscribe to this list.

THanks for your time and help

one last time for today, before I go to bed. It's 2:22 am, already, time
flies I I start talking to much ... :-)

do a 

man fvwm2
and then press /Style

and read this section carefully. Have a closer look at the color option
of Style. Other than that I can only recommend printing the whole manual
and reading it. Read other peoples fvwm2rc files (mine says on the top:

daedalus% more .fvwm2rc
# this is a sample .fvwmrc file for fvwm-2.
# Apparantly, you can retrieve sample .fvwmrc's from 
#       ftp://ftp.best.com/pub/tdgilman/Fvwmrcs
# you can also submit your favourite .fvwmrc to
#       tdgilman@best.com 
# if you want to.

Hope that helped,

Bad idea, leave that where your X installation has the pix- and bitmaps

Did you compile this one already? If not, do that first. But you will be
into trouble anyway, see below

Anotherone bites the dust :-) Todd, are you reading this :-)

Your X installation isn't configured properly. Ask your sysadmin to do
this. There is almost no way to get around this :-(

One solution, though, find out where your X installation resides.
then try:

imake -DUseInstalled -I/absolute/path/of/X/installation/lib/X11/config

Note that you must be in the xpm (and later in the fvwm) directory.
If that doesn't work, you have to invest a huge amount of time to get
all this stuff compiled by hand. Better ask your sysadmin to fix the
imake setup or try compiling on another station and move the bins to the
ultra.

Okay, there is one of two things (really just one) that is going on
here.  There is a command called Style.  When you see Style "*", then
all the command apply to all windows by default.  Except if the is a
Style "whatever" in which case all command here will be run instead of
the defaults.  Color, and every other interface type configuration
runs via Style.

Hello,

I'd like to see a long icon title when it is focused.
(like mwm)
Can I set it as a style command?

Any information would be very appreciated.

Hi,

Well: After finally happily running and properly stopping fvwm-2.0.43
under Digital Unix 4.0 there is only one (well actually minor) problem:

The title of the 'dxterm' (terminal-emulator - DEC counterpart of
xterm) is messed. When I set the title to, say, "DECTerm" it appears
as 

                        1]DECTerm

on the title bar! All other window titles appear correct!

So before I start digging around in fvwm2: Has anyone stumbled accross
the same thing or has anyone a clue what could cause the problem?

BTW: This does *NOT* happen with mwm as the window manager.

Thanks -- Tom

Yep - at least I think so. I had a very similiar problem, but on a
much larger scale - because I use a Hebrew version of Motif on my
Digital Unix machine (3.2c). I had to work pretty hard, but I finally
discovered that the Motif I have uses something called compound
text. Apparently, the text is preceeded by some additional binary
information - which font to use, which direction, etc. Digital's Motif
knows what to do with this stuff, fvwm doesn't. Apparently, someone in
Japan developed a version of fvwm which handles this stuff, but all
the documentation is in Japanese, and I don't know how up to date it
is, so I rejected this solution. What I did in the end, was to hack
some of the fvwm code to look for certain values (the binary stuff) at
the beginning of strings, and to rip them out. It turns out that I had
to make only a few minor changes in only a few places. I'm not a C
programmer, so if I was able to  do it, it couldn't have been too
tough. If you want, I can forward to you some of the messages I
received on this topic. Also, if you don't mind lousy C code, I could
make up some diff files, and send you those too. 


Good Luck.

The Imake config files probably aren't installed in
/usr/lib/X11/config, since SunOS & Solaris systems usually keep that
in /usr/openwin/lib/config, so your xmkmf script seems to be a little
messed up.  Try running imake by hand with that other directory
(assuming your Imake config files are actually located there).

Yup - RTFM.  From the FvwmButtons man page:

          To use FvwmButtons with several different configurations,
          you can invoke FvwmButtons with an optional parameter, which
          it will use as its name instead (e.g "Module FvwmButtons
          SomeButtons").  SomeButtons will then read only the lines in
          the configuration file starting with "*SomeButtons", and not
          the lines belonging to FvwmButtons.

Time for RTFM :). From the FvwmButtons manual page:

       To use FvwmButtons with several different  configurations,
       you  can  invoke  FvwmButtons  with an optional parameter,
       which it will use as its name instead (e.g  "Module  Fvwm

I have a mailbox that I pop up from FvwmButtons, as follows:


Style "MailBox"     NoButton 4, NoButton 6, NoIcon

*NewButtons(Title "MailBox" Icon letters.xpm Action "Raise-Mail")

AddToFunc Raise-Mail
+       "I"     None ["MailBox"]               Exec xterm -title MailBox -name MailBox -e /home/cwolf/mailbox_prog_script &
+       "I"     Next ["MailBox" CirculateHit]  Iconify -1
+       "I"     Next ["MailBox" CirculateHit]  Focus
+       "I"     Next ["Mailbox" CirculateHit]  WarpToWindow 10 10

 
FvwmIdent gives the following about the xterm with my mail program in it:

	Name:		MailBox
	Icon Name:	pine
	Class:		XTerm
	Resource:	MailBox


In 2.0.42, I used a Focus 10 10, but there is the new function in
2.0.43 called WarpToWindow, and Focus no longer takes arguments.
Unfortunately, it does not do anything for me in this particular
example.  It works in other places, including a function very nearly
the same used for Netscape.  Can anyone tell me why?

Is there a starts-in-room style like the StartsOnDesk style?  Or do I
need to emulate it using some of the other functions available.

Basically, there isn't a function like this.
I've been suggesting for some time that a virtual window manager
_needs_ a StartsOnPage function to make buttons truly useful.

(Simple, I'd like to be working, click a button for an editor,
or a newsreader more likely!, have it start up quietly on 
another page while I work on...the best I can emulate is flicking
to the page and starting it up, thats not what I want/need.
I hate staring at things starting up or waiting for connections etc.)

What I dislike is not being able to return to the page I was on.
I can sort-of emulate it with GotoPage, but I cannot return to where
I was.  I'd like this for a number of programs that need to run in
a window, but which I seldom need to look at -- only to check up
on them every now and then... oh well.

I just noticed that

	Style "*" DecorateTransient

doesn't do what I thought, namely it doesn't put all the titlebar
buttons in dialog boxes. Should it? Or did I miss something? Can you
not have more than two right buttons?

I have:

# Mouse Bindings
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Button        Context         Modifiers       Function
Mouse 0         1               A               Menu Window-Ops2 Close

Mouse 0         2               A               Close
Mouse 0         4               A               Maximize-Func
Mouse 0         6               A               Iconify
Mouse 0         8               A               Lower
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

to get 1 left titlebar button and 4 right titlebar buttons. But on the
dialog boxes (which I thought would be considered transient) I only
see the left button and two right buttons (context 6 and 8). I also
have 

     Style "*"           MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride

set, in case it matters.

Here is what xprop/xwininfo says about an example dialog box:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xprop
WM_STATE(WM_STATE):

Have you seen the Amulet GUI system?  They have a gesture recognition
library in it that is really cool.  It can be trained to recognize X's,
O's, and scribbles...  It got me thinking.

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/amulet/www/amulet-home.html

 Wouldn't it be neato if you could circle an icon and point to a spot on
the virtual desktop inside the pager, and have the icon go there?

 Or make an X over a window to close it? (in the FvwmPager)

 Or if you could point at the spot you want a window to land, and have
it start there?  Hmmm...  move the mouse into the pager, press a prefix
key, click a spot on the map, then launch a program in the usual way.
(via menu, xterm, or button.)  The program lands with it's upper left on
the spot you clicked.


Linux People:  Why not take the Amulet gesture lib and make it a .so for
many apps to use?  If it's not done by the time I know how, I'll do it.
:)  Could make a good part of OffiX's DND thingy ?


 TkDesk does something like it.  If you set an option, new windows open
at the cursor location.  It's ok as long as you aren't using FvwmAuto,
and move off the new window and have it buried under a larger window.

Idea:  FvwmAuto:  Holding down a key will reverse it, so it sinks the
window to the back instead of raising it to the top.  So it's autoraise
most of the time, but I hold down ScrollLock and it sinks windows.

sounds complicated, if you could just pick the icon and drop it onto the
pager location. :-)

If you've no titlebar, this could be interesting.
But I can't think of working without titlebar or at least a global
window-ops menu.

quite complicated, too.
I'd rather have ActivePlacement and drop the window into the pager,
or use a "StartsOn Desk d Page x y" style.

Dropping windows & icons onto the pager has been requested since - uhm -
ever. How about sombody implementing these ?

If I want to sink a window I want it to happen immediately.
And I would hate to see the window I've benn looking for appear and sink
again.
But YMMV.

I've suggested to give FvwmAuto an FvwmAutoFunction parameter, before.
You could then specify raise, focus, or lower as the function.
(though this doesn't cover your request to switch between two functions by
holding a modifier)

tried all the combinations !).

I have an application (Mosaic2.8alpha) which I can't seem to click/focus
and type in URL's. I can click buttons and it works ok, it is just I
can't activate and type in anything. Anything I typed show up in the
xterm where Mosaic is started. I can type in another xterm and copy/paste
using mouse into Mosaic though.
fvwm2.0.43, QNX(a realtime POSIX-compliant Unix on Intel PCs) and X11R5.

It works ok with twm. But for mwm, if I enable AutoFocus, I will
have this same problem, if I disable AutoFocus, I can activate
the Mosaic window by clicking the window body, but if I click
the window title bar, I won't be able to activate.

Is that a known problem?

Decorate transient works fine.
Perhaps you also have:

Style "*" OLDecor

somewhere in your .fvwm2rc file.  This will cause the symptom you describe.

If not be more specific about which application's transients are undecorated.

I can't help you but since we are on the topic, I am looking for a decent

anyone know of any descent programs for mixing/editing sound files.  I am

I've   used Suns "audiotool" and  "soundtool".    The both seem pretty
basic to me.

No, I don't have OLDecor. But I did have MWMFunctions, which also seems to
have that affect.

Yep. Dan prompted me to fiddle with my MWM* settings, and that's the
one for me, too. I thought MWMDecor would be the culprit, but that had
no effect. I don't understand why 

          MWMFunctions  makes  fvwm  attempt  to  recognize   and
          respect the mwm prohibited operations hints that appli-
          cations  occasionally  use.   HintOverride  makes  fvwm
          shade  out  operations  that mwm would prohibit, but it
          lets you perform the operation anyway.

would affect titlebar buttons. BTW, 

	Style "*" MWMFunctions,HintOverride

does _not_ change things -- you have to get rid of the MWMFunctions
altogether.

Anyway, I think I can live without MWMCrap ;-).

The example I posted earlier was the Netscape "Save As..." dialog box
(but this isn't critical, as it has a Cancel button). Of more concern
was a FrameMaker spell-check box, which lost the ability to dismiss
itself.

Here's what xprop/xwininfo says about this particular window, though I
can't decipher it myself. Although this is resolved, it's not _really_
resolved for me until I understand what's going on.

Thanks again for pointing me in the right direction.

Some sounds are available at ftp.sdsu.edu in /pub/fvwm.

This module seems to just NOT want to run for me.  I've got a 

Module FvwmAudio

in my .fvwm2rc file along with the proper configuration lines, but
noting happens!

Nor can I activate from the FvwmTalk module or a menu.

This is on an R4000 SGI Indy running Irix 5.3.

Anyone have any ideas?  I'm not even seeing an error message.

Hi everybody,

I'm a new FVWM95 user and I have problem with the modules.

First of all I must say that I just a common user (not 'root' at all),
I've compiled all the package sources, I ran successfully fvwm95-2
from my .xinitrc but I don't see any modules.

My .fvwmrc part is :

#
# Module path and paths to the icons
# ModulePath is a colon-separated list, just like regular unix PATH
#
ModulePath /home/gout/fvwm95-2.0.42a/
PixmapPath /home/gout/fvwm95-2.0.42a/mini-icons/
IconPath   /usr/openwin/include/X11/bitmaps/:/home/gout/fvwm95-2.0.42a/icons/

I don't know if it works fine, but the result is : NONE !!!

NB: fvwm95-2.0.42a is my root directory where I untared fvwm95.

Thanks a lot in advance for help.

is there a new one coming soon?

I just installed fvwm and I love it except for the fact the I have no
access to my arrow keys and miscellaneous function keys (copy, paste)
any longer.  I was previously using Openwindows and all my keys were
working properly.  What gives here?  I've search the FAQs and tried to
find out information but I've had no luck.  Can someone help me out?  I
am running on a Sun Sparc20 with a type 5 keyboard.  Any help is greatly
appreciated.

Hi:

I am using fvwm2 (actually fvwm95-2 built from fvwm95-2.0.42a) on Sun Sparc 5
running SunOS 4.1.3 with multiple frame buffers, two screens. I have the 
following questions:

* Where is the FAQ/info for multiple frame-buffers if there is one.

* Can I run fvwm2 on one fb and another (say olvwm) on the other. If so, how ?

* Assuming there is no FAQ listing for this and also assuming there is no
  non-trivial way of running two different window managers, how do I make 
  some of the buttons not duplicate on both the screens, specially ones like 
  "xload" and "mail-biff" which can be annoying at times.

I am basically looking for some good way of using my screens as one big
desktop area and not be just two identical screens with duplicated info.

Thanks for your time.

I am trying to have the root menu (pop-up) have as its title

to do something with M4 or CPP but I can't figure out what.  I
don't see anything in the fvwm doc's about putting something in

I've done this with M4. I have 3 machines that all use the same fvwmrc
files, and I set up a hostname (and a host icon) in the FvwmButtons bar.
Warning: I am just learning M4, there are probably much better ways to
handle this.

# Handy capitalization functions from the M4 info pages:
define(`UPCASE', `translit(`$*', `a-z',`A-Z')')
define(`DOWNCASE', `translit(`$*', `A-Z', `a-z')')
define(`CAPITALIZE_WORD',`regexp(`$1', `^\(\w\)\(\w*\)',`UPCASE(`\1')`'DOWNCASE(`\2')')')

# Get base hostname, and capitalize 1st letter.
define(NAME_LEN,index(HOSTNAME,`.'))
# If NAME_LEN=-1, there isn't a fqdn.
define(BASENAME,ifelse(NAME_LEN,-1,HOSTNAME,substr(HOSTNAME,0,NAME_LEN)))
define(BASENAME,CAPITALIZE_WORD(BASENAME))
undefine(NAME_LEN)

Then it's just a matter of using BASENAME at some point in the menu
definition. I guess something like this:

AddToMenu "Desktop" "BASENAME" Title
+ ...

Thanks for your information on putting the hostname in the pop-up root
menu as the title.  However, I tried this and it doesn't seem to work.
Do the lines you sent go in the .fvwm2rc file or somewhere else?

Yes it can be done with m4 and probably with cpp.  I have a setup where
I have defined in my .Xdefaults different xterm configurations for
different machines.  I then have ported my fvwm setup between four
different accounts with different architectures.  I have a single
generic xterm button but if I am on the machine wakko this button brings
up an xterm with the configuration named wakko, etc.

All of this is accomplished by:

	#1 Parsing the .fvwm2rc file with FvwmM4
	#2 passing the CLIENTHOST M4 macro to the -name command for
		xterm.

Likewise, you can simply use CLIENTHOST for your menus.  To parse your
files with m4, FvwmM4 must be compiled and installed on your system.
Then for fvwm2.0.43 the command:

	fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm2rc'

Will parse your files with m4 and replace any references to CLIENTHOST
with the machines name.  For more information please check out the man
page on FvwmM4.

Also note, for version previous to 2.0.43 the command was:

	fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm2rc'

They go in .fvwm2rc, but you have to make sure the file is being processed
by fvwmM4. Man FvwmM4 for details.

Hi,

Having finlly managed to get fvwm-2.0.43 compiled on my system (uname -a =
HP-UX bonsai5 A.09.05 A 9000/710 2002857507 two-user license), everything
appears to work correctly except emacs.

What happens is, it loads up as normal, but the cursor, minibuffer and
mouse cursor colour is black, the same as the background colour.  This
makes emacs near unusable.

My emacs version is GNU Emacs 19.33.2.  I have not had time to delve into
the .fvwm2rc, but I did try 10 other .fvwm2rc's I got off the net and each
had the same emacs problem, leading me to believe that this isn't where
the problem lies.  Under HP-VUE, this machine's default WM, emacs also
looks fine.  Also I have not altered my .Xdefaults file in the change from
HP-VUE to FVWM.

I'm sure this is a simple problem to fix, but I don't know how, so any
help would be appreciated.

Most of you may know "editres", a program to view the widget-tree of a
window.
An interesting feature: you can modify the actual Xresources of a
window with this little tool.

Example: get the tree of a "xterm" and set the resource "xterm.font.vt100"
to "10x20". Voila, the font changes (remotly).

Now, if we could get this functionallity into a fvwm-module, the
usal pop-down menu from the upper left corner could look like

    +---------------+
    | Move          |
    | Resize        |
    | Iconify       |
    | Close         |
    +---------------+
    | Configuration |
    +---------------+

where "Configuration" is a sub-menu with various Xresources (not the
widget-names, but a more symbolic descritption should be presented to the
user). 
Of course it should be configurable which Xresources are
offered/changeable.

You don't like "green" as background-color of your "xdvi"? No problem, go
into "Configuration" and change it. No messing around with your
~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources !

This technique would be a hack, of course, but nevertheless it would
enhance the easy of using X11. And most of the module to be written could
be stolen from "editres", I expect.

I want this! This is seriously cool looking stuff here. I've managed to
download and compile this guy's patched rxvt with XPM support and that
is great but I just love this bloke's marbled window frames. He's taken
the titlebar pixmap patch one step father so that the entire window is
textured. It looks fantastic! Can somebody do this? Please? _Please_?

This is a bit of a frequently asked question, I'm sorry for the
repetition...a brief search didn't turn up the answer either.

What is the current status of the titlebar pixmap patch?
Where can I get it?

Thats it.

(I'm one of those sad people who like the cosmetic aspects of fvwm2,
vertical pixmaped titlebars, or better yet, the 'marbled' window
effect seen at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/ are wonderful!)

Oh, almost forgot to include my customary plea for StartsOnPage...

  I wrote to him some days ago about his patches. As far as I
understood he did all the patches: He didn't use any of the patches of
Andrew Veliath (titlebar pixmap, buttons...). There are 3 missing
patches: Menus, frame corners, and FvwmButtons backgroundPixamp
resource. I spy on jarl's page everyday for the latter :).

Good idea.  

However, editres isn't always that useful. The builder of an X application
has to make a conscious effort to make an application work with editres.
I.e. the programmer has to stick a function call in the code to get the
application to understand the editres protocol.  I suspect that this is
the case with any application that wants to go fooling around with an
application's resources.  (After all, hanky-panky without consent is
called rape, you know.  I guess you could call that kind of application
"xrape".)  Many applications don't support the editres protocol.

3 More on Editres
-----------------
This program lets you display the tree of widgets, showing their names or
classes. You can also change some resource values in a running program. To
use this on a program, you must change some things.

   1.Add this declaration near the top. 

     extern void _XEditResCheckMessages();

   2.Add this sometime before the end. 

         XtAddEventHandler(top_level_widget, (EventMask)0, True,
                             _XEditResCheckMessages, NULL);

     should be the top level widget. If want to be able to click on popups, do this for each popup also. 

   3.Add another library, , to the , after . I've done this to ==`/-////dept/ecse/graphics/Makefile=. 
   4.Compile the program. 
   5.Read its man page and . 

Get the widget tree on xtext before and after hitting the help button the
first time. Notice that there are a lot more widgets now. 


magill> (After all, hanky-panky without consent is
magill> called rape, you know.  I guess you could call that kind of application
magill> "xrape".)  

Please be serious about this. If I sent a request to a program that
ignores this request but nothings happens it has absolutly nothing to do
with rape. It seems kinky to me to use the term "rape" in conjunction with
behaviour of computer software at all.


magill> Many applications don't support the editres protocol.

Maybe more will if there is a useful user-interface like via a sub-menu of
fvwm. I'm no X-programmer, but the required patches seem to be modest to
me.

Yeah, I may actually have to give in and add the title bar patch (or

about the original patch & "Rasterman's" patches.

Duly noted, as always.  It *will* appear someday, but probably not
until after 2.1.0 (otherwise I'll never get it out, and it's taking
long enough as it is).

I see no reason to include it in any beta or official version. Provided
I can find someone who can either 
a) explain how to patch it in words of one syllable
or
b) do it for me (it always pays to be nice to the SysAdmin)
Then I'm happy with a patch. However, having gone to the extent of having a 
pixmap background for the title, then why not go the whole hog and have a 
textured window frame. If the demand really is there for inclusion in the
whole package then by all means, but don't put yourself out Chuck.

Thanks to those people who helped me out with my emacs problem.  The
eventual solution was given to me by Michael Tiefenback
<tiefen@mgt.cebaf.gov>.

For anyone who cares to know the problem was that HP-VUE window manager
gets some of it's settings from it's own secret places, rather than just
the .Xdefaults file.  Therefore, under HP-VUE, my emacs was getting extra
settings that made it look correct, but when I started fvwm, these
settings were not present and emacs looked wrong.

The solution was just to execute "xrdb -query | less" in HP-VUE and look
for emacs-related stuff.  Add this to the .Xdefaults and it should work
okay.

It's probably an obvious solution to almost everyone, and I'm making
myself flamebait, but hell, it confused me.

Now onto something else...

I THOUGHT I'd managed to compile and build fvwm correctly (that is, I
couldn't see any make errors).  But when fvwm loads it gives me the
following error:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /u/ajsmith/fvwm:
PixmapPath

And then it proceeds, with nothing else amiss.

Looking at my fvwm2rc, I see:

# Search paths for various things.  All are colon-separated lists.
ModulePath	/u/ajsmith/fvwm:

# Pixmaps are coloured icons and have a .xpm extension.
PixmapPath	/u/ajsmith/fvwm/pixmaps:
# Bitmaps are b&w and have a .xbm extension.
IconPath	/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:

etc., etc.

The paths look okay to me.  If I comment out the PixmapPath, no error is
reported.  I did compile with Pixmaps, I did previously FTP and build
libxpm, and I don't think there were any problems with that.  I haven't
yet got any xpm's so I don't know if xpm are working (though if the
PixmapPath command isn't working I doubt I'd see much anyway).

If nothing else, does the error I got suggest that my xpm support was not
compiled in correctly (either in the build of libxpm, or it's subsequent
inclusion in fvwm)??

Actually, what I meant is that if I do include it (which I think I am

I'm going to check out Rasterman's patches, just for grins, but I
don't think I'll include that just yet.  But perhaps if his additions
are simple, maybe I will add them as a compile time option as well.
Who knows?

Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-prebeta2

Uh oh, here is an experimental [i.e., first implementation :] patch
which textures pixmaps in the window frame background... Please note
this may or may not cause problems for you, but please email me
problems you have [or don't have].  I've not tested it extensively.

All it does is add a new titlestyle, i.e.:

titlestyle activetexture <a pixmap>

or 

titlestyle inactivetexture <a pixmap>

The options can be combined to one line.  Use at your own risk! :)
Sorry for the length.  It is not large, but for email it is not small
either.  You should be able to omit the pixmap to get rid of the
texture.  If response to this is okay and it is refined, I might
integrate this into my next titlebar patch.

Dare you try it, you need to apply my tbp5 patch and then this one (in
that order).

I have 1.x fvwm, and I have problems with setting up colors for
non-selected windows. I know it should be StdForeColor and StdBackColor,
but it doesn't work. HiFOreColor and HiBackColor work, and others, but
whatever I do, Std*Color doesnt change (its blue). I'm wondering if anyone
can tell me where is it comming from? Some default file I don't know
about? I have .fvwmrc in my dir, and I got rid of system.fvwmrc file. I
also have .xinitrc, .Xdefaults and so on. What am I missing? I have
XF86_S3G server.
Thanks.

Bruno

Yes. I had the same problem. It turned out to be a "style" definition in the 
.fvwmrc that overrode the Std*Color settings. Look for I line like

Style "*" BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, Color Black/#60a0c0,Icon unknown1.xpm

Righto. Have done. After finding that you have to put the whole path for the

Now in a good impression of never being satisfied.. How about completing

After using the new patch for nicer window borders I have small
problem...all the nicer apm's I have found have turned out to have
been .gifs at some point and so have 200+ colours. Not a good thing.

So, anyone know of a site with _small_ pixmaps (textures, marbled
backdrops etc) with a _small_ number of colours?

Any help appreciated.

Strange. I've tested the patch at noon and had not such a problem.
Is your PixmapPath like this?
PixmapPath /.../pixmaps/:/.../pixmaps2/
                       ^^^

FvwmButtons is maintained by Jarl:
http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html
I'm waiting for the FvwmButtons background too... I read that Jarl's
made the changes 6 months ago but broke his hard disk. I had no news
since then :(.

Icons???
What do you want to do with icons????

Good to hear it seems to work there.  I am not sure why you need the
entire path there, as it is working here with pixmap path. 

Well, as for new features, I just put a *new* patch on the page which
also allows one to turn off the resizing handles (down side is that
the texture maps don't smoothly connect).  Selectively too, since it
is just a flag for each ActiveUp, ActiveDown or Inactive, i.e., to
turn the flag on even after you've configured the pixmap, say you
might:

Check out

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_title_picture.html#patches

for the new patch (tbp5b) and a small pic.

Whew... :)

Enjoy,
Andy

I have noticed this requirement, also, but have always considered it a
bug that was so obvious, there was no need to mention it. Since you
mention it, I'd like to add that this really should be fixed one day
(Or at least documented somewhere :)

I have defined a 'destroy' button (X) like in Windows95, -now, that is
fine, but i cannot seem to place it in the rightmost corner of the window
(like in W95)? -It pops up as button #3 (from left) no matter what i try!
-and the man pages fail to enlighten me...

Could someone here tell me what to do?

I took a long long look at Rasterman's page.  Although I find his ideas to
be REALLY cool, 8 hours of looking at that desktop could give one a very
serious migraine headache.

I'm not saying that some of these feature shouldn't be added.  If these
are fairly small nonintrusive patches they should included.  They could
make for some VERY attractive desktops when used properly.

What I would _r e a l l y_  like to see:

-	Optional mini-pixmaps on the WindowList, and title bar
	or on the N/W title bar button.  This mini-icon would
	"follow" the application via a common FVWM style.  This has
	already been done well by the Fvwm95 team via 
	Style "whatever" Titleicon mini-icon.xpm
	Perhaps Hector P. could share a patch with us.

-	If the titlebar pixmap patch is not adopted, then at the
	least we should be able to set the titlebar (just the title
	button itself) to a different color that the rest of the 
	window frame.

-	The ability to NOT display geometry on the WindowList.
	Actually, the whole WindowList syntax needs to be made less
	cryptic.  Again, Fvwm95 has improved this and we could benefit
	from their work.  Here is an excerpt from the Fvwm95 man page
	regarding WindowList options.

              ShowAllDesks - All windows on all desktops 

              ShowCurrentDesk - Only windows on the current desk-
              top will be shown.

              ShowDesk  n - Only windows on desktop number n will
              be shown.

              ShowGeometry - When specified, the geometry of each
              window  will  be  added to the list. 

              UseWindowNames - The windows are listed  using  the
              window (titlebar) name. This is the default

              UseIconNames  -  The  window's  icon  names is used
              instead of the title name.

This is just my two cents.  Although I have tinkered with and contributed
code to Fvwm95, I'm no Win95 fan.  Nor am I really fond of the Win95
(Where in hell did the frames go?!?) look. I'm sure many of you share this
sentiment.  However, that doesn't mean that we can't benefit from some of
the useful and attractive ideas of others.  Not everything in the Win95
interface is bogus.  Even the taskbar itself is a good idea, especially
when in autohide mode.  It's just a horizontal FvwmWinList with a few
amenities, right?  If you think about it, we did it first.  So, let's sue
MS. ;-)   Just kidding....

The button must be the LOWEST even numbered button.  BTW, it's IS in the

I probably wouldn't use the rxvt-background for long, considering HUGE
pixmaps (spell: slow redraw?) & near unreadable text.
I do like the marble decorations, though. (I could live without, but ..)

I guess andrew's workin on it, and I vote for inclusion of his patches.

I vote vor adoption. It's not that big, is it?
We could gain more by code-cleanups & better orthogonality of features.
(i.e: the windowlist is a menu as well, so solve the mini-icon stuff for
menus in general, but in a way windowlist can use it, and the windowlist
mini-icons are free. I think _that_ patch would be included immediately.)

has been done. (I mailed a patch to chuck, actually it contained some more
changes. You'll probably see them in 2.1.0)

I'd suggest more people "put their money where their mouth is" (from
rec.ww) and not only discuss changes, but send chuck diffs.

Well I put the colon there to try to fix it in the first place.  Without
the colon it just gives me this error:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /u/ajsmith/fvwm/
PixmapPath

It looks like that whether I give a trailing slash or not.

Yup, Matt has re-started the voting for X window managers.  I would like
to encourage all of my fellow fvwm users to visit his page and cast a
vote for out favorite window manager.

Does anybody have and reasonable settings to get a single row
IconBox swallowed in a ButtonBox? I just can't seem to get the sizing
right. Ideally I'd like all my icons in the front panel and be able
to de-iconify the apps by hitting a button (maybe there's an Action
to do this?)

Hello,

how can I get my environment variables (defined in my ".bashrc"-file) to
be known to the programs started from fvwm2 using for example the button
bar or function keys defined in my ".fvwmrc"-file ?

Bye,

Jacques Bloch.

Renamed to 'Style MiniIcons' of course, since They are not always on the
title bar.(They could go in WinList,FvwmWinList, TaskBar?

I have the FvwmWinList MiniIcon patch(The one in Fvwm95), for when
someone adds the MiniIcon Style.

I dont mind the look of Fvwm95.  I would rather see that look as options
so I can mix and match what I like.  This will most likely happen in
Fvwm2.

Maybe.  If It grew to show All Icons, not Xt..., Wt..., then It would be
useful(like FvwmWinList)

Hi, I currently use SloppyFocus for almost all windows, but I'd like it so
that if I click (button 0) anywhere in a window (not just the frame, I
mean anywhere within the confines of the window) it will be raised.

At the moment, if I move into a window it won't raise even though it has
focus.  I have to move the mouse to the frame or titlebar and click to
raise it, which can be annoying if most of the title bar is covered or if
it is a large window.

Hi,


. Hi, I currently use SloppyFocus for almost all windows, but I'd like it so
. that if I click (button 0) anywhere in a window (not just the frame, I
. mean anywhere within the confines of the window) it will be raised.

You can get it by adding this line to your configuration file.

Mouse 1         WTFS       A       Raise

But only problem is that you lose the ability to cut and paste in xterm.

. At the moment, if I move into a window it won't raise even though it has
. focus.  I have to move the mouse to the frame or titlebar and click to
. raise it, which can be annoying if most of the title bar is covered or if
. it is a large window.
. 

A better solution to your problem is to map one of your keys (I use the
Front "L5" key) to raise the window.

Hello, 

I've been using Fvwm2.4+ for a few days on SunOS 4.1.3
I compiled it with gcc 2.7.2, xpm 3.4h, etc..

It works fine with all my programs but one of
them (ProcTool) tells this:

> brutus# ./proctool
> Assertion failure, datatype != KSTAT_DATA_ULONG
> Warning: Cannot convert string "times-bold-14" to type FontStruct
> ProCtool, reading init file "/usr/local/proctool/.proc.init" ...
> X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
> resource denied)
>  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
>  Serial number of failed request:  1595
>  Current serial number in output stream:  1596

But this program works fine with the old "mwm" !

So, what can I do to solve the problem ?? Any idea ??

thanks,
Jerome.

This is a standard failure and is due to an fvwm mouse binding 
conflicting with one built into the process.  It is usually a button in 
the window.  I use 

Mouse 1         W       M       RaiseLower

rather than the system.fvwm(2)rc file.  If this is not in the FAQ, then it 
should be.  I had to find it myself, and it is asked several times a year 
on the list.

Jerome> Hello,
Jerome> I've been using Fvwm2.4+ for a few days

When referring to fvwm version numbers, please use the correct full
version number if you know it (see the man page for how to figure that
out).  It is a number like 2.0.43 (not 2.4), and the distinction is
rather important in case one is referring to a bug that was fixed in a
specific patchlevel.  This is not the case for this problem, but
enough people do this so I figured I should say something (I'm putting
a note about that in the FAQ too).

Jerome> So, what can I do to solve the problem ?? Any idea ??

You just reminded me of another thing I wanted to put in the FAQ, but
had forgotten about.  Coincidentally it answers your question:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

31) I try to run some program under FVWM, but it dies with an X11
    error like BadAccess.  The same program works just fine under MWM
    or OLWM.  What's going on?

A: The error message usually looks something like this:

        X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
        resource denied)
         Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
         Serial number of failed request:  1595
         Current serial number in output stream:  1596

   Well, this is generally telling you that there is a conflict in
   key/button assignments.  In your .fvwm2rc you have bound some
   key/button that this program really wants to bind to an action, but
   it can't since FVWM has already done so (but you weren't doing it
   in the rc file for your previous window manager).  Figure out what
   the offending key binding is and remove it from your .fvwm2rc, or
   temporarily via FvwmTalk by removing the FVWM binding (see the man
   page for the Key & Mouse commands).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hope that helps,
Chuck

I use xdm on my box and have the following at the top of my .xsession

I have an application which runs great under twm/mwm/fvwm1, but
fails with fvwm2 (2.0.43), Here are the messages on the console:

 X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  12 (X_ConfigureWindow)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x380000a
   Serial number of failed request:  58
   Current serial number in output stream:  58
 X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GetWindowAttributes)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x2c00098
   Serial number of failed request:  7054
   Current serial number in output stream:  7055

This is a proprietary application. It is supposed to start in
normal mode (not in iconic mode). On startup, it gives a 
main window and then opens lots of other windows (for example, 
window with some copyright notice, and several tool windows, 
or something like that). Some of those windows exit/abort 
immediately after created, this is normal 'cause some are
intentionally and some dies due to lack of license for
certain tools on the network (license used up by other people).
With twm/mwm/fvwm1, this is ok and I can still have a main
windows with menus left, but with fvwm2, my main windows
then dies immediately.

I tried comment out
#Mouse 3         W       M       RaiseLower
without any luck. 
I don't think if this is a key binding conflict.

Any ideas?

FVWM 2.0.43
SunOS 4.1.3 on Sparc 1

I am trying to select the bitmaps to use for the icons for several
windows. The man page for fvwm2 says that when selecting the
appropriate icon (based on the "Style windowname"), the windowname is
matched with name, class, or resource string with 'name' getting
preference, followed by class.

My .fvwm2rc contains: Style "*Weather*"       Icon weather.xbm

The application is run in an xterm, but the window is renamed "LLNL
Weather Report" and the Ident module confirms that this is the
window's name. None the less, the icon used is the one for general
xterms, not the one for weather.

Is this a bug or am I mis-understanding something?

This may be a very newbie question but any way.

How can I lock my workspace in fvwm2?

In 1.24, there was a module for this but I can not find 
it in fvwm2.

Thanks for help. Please reply to mee as well.

Hello *,

Is there a way to move a window to the current desktop (Something like
the funtion WindowsDesk, only then to the current desktop and not to a
predefined desktop number). (BTW I'm using fvwm95-2.0.42a, but I think
it applies to fvwm2 too.) 

I've read the manual pages but I couldn't find it anywhere, so I patched
virtual.c to move a window to the current desk if the parameter to Windows-
Desk is 666 (:-), but I thought maybe it could be accomplished in a better
way.

Greeting Rogier

I used to be a ClickToFocus person until SloppyFocus came along. 
However, there is one annoying "feature" of it in that it still gives 
focus to icons.  My opinion is that the whole idea of SloppyFocus is 
to have the focus follow the mouse only when it enters something worth 
giving the keyboard focus to. Icons don't seem to want it. "Fixing" 
the behavior is a simple one item patch I have included below for 
those who don't want icons getting keyboard focus.

This is a little off subject, but does anyone know how the new X -
Broadway - will affect fvwm. Will I still have my familiar X setup with
fvwm as my window manager or will window managers be superceded or need
to be changed?

Does this development also make a previous idea of communicating with
modules by ip/tcp a better idea than the present method?

Subject: FVWM: I've added miniicons to fvwm. Here's the patch

Got tired of people (including me) talking about it, so I spent yesterday
adding miniicons into fvwm. I don't expect this stuff to be put into the 2.1
release (nor do I think it's necessarily wise to do so). I basically followed
what fvwm95 did, with the following changes:

1. Instead of calling these things title icons, they're mini icons, since they
   can be used in other places than the title bar.

2. You use the ButtonStyle's to say where it goes, exactly like how
   PixmapButtons does it. 

I changed the builtin WindowList to use the icons, and added some stuff to
FvwmIconMan to use the miniicon to denote an iconified window instead of the
raised square thing. The FvwmIconMan code is rather rough proof-of-concept
type code (you can't turn off displaying icons mainly), but it seems to work.
Also, the version of FvwmIconMan that I hacked is the one that's due to come
out in the next release of fvwm, and is significantly different than the one
in 2.0.43. Read the CHANGES file and the manpage for info (nothing on
miniicons is mentioned though).

I didn't do anything to FvwmWinList, since somebody else indicated that they
were willing to do that. 

Here's the relevant lines from my .fvwm2rc file:

Style "*"          MiniIcon mini-bx2.xpm
Style "xterm"      MiniIcon mini.xterm.xpm
Style "Emacs"      MiniIcon mini-doc.xpm

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon

That's it. As with pixmapbuttons, you can use a buttonstyle of MiniIcon
to have a relief put around the pixmap, or you can use FullMiniIcon to have no
relief.

Also, there's no provision for a default MiniIcon, except for the "*" style. 
If it can't find one, you get a blank spot.

I've protected all of the code that matters with #ifdef MINI_ICONS, so
(a) you need that set in your Fvwm.tmpl (the patch does that), and it pretty
clearly marks out where I've made changes. Finally, you need XPM.

  invoke it later. FvwmIconMan should be placed in the ModulePath (defined in
  the .fvwmrc file) in order for fvwm to find it.
  
+ If you wish to run FvwmIconMan in a transient mode, such as with the built
+ in window list, then pass Transient as an argument. The invocation 
+ "Module FvwmIconMan Transient" will do nicely. In this mode, FvwmIconMan
+ will pop up one manager window directly under the cursor. When the mouse
+ button is released, it will execute the appropriate action, and then exit.
+ Things are somewhat complicated by the fact that you can specify that 
+ FvwmIconMan create multiple manager windows, behavior which is unsuitable
+ when running transiently. So, when running transiently, FvwmIconMan will
+ only create one manager window. Use the manager id 'transient' to specify
+ options for this manager window.
+ 
+ .SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS REFERENCE CHART
+ FvwmIconMan has acquired quite a few options. I assume others share my
+ dislike of paging though a long manpage, so here is a terse reference
+ chart describing the available options. They are described in more detail
+ in the next section.

! Normally, actions bound to a mouse click are executed when the button is

! released, since it is assumed that FvwmIconMan was bound to some mouse
! event. A tip/warning: FvwmIconMan still keeps track of the mouse button
! and any modifier keys in this case, so if you bind FvwmIconMan to say,
! meta-button3, then it would be wise to ensure that the action you want
! to execute will be executed when the meta-button3 event occurs (which would
! be the button release, assuming you kept your finger on the meta key).

! This is version 0.5 of FvwmIconMan, an icon manager modeled roughly on 
! TWM's icon manager.
  
! It has been tested under linux, solaris, OSF/1 3.0, and hp-ux 9.01. The latest
! changes I made haven't been tested under sunos4, as I no longer have access to 
! a sunos4 machine, but I believe they should work.
  
! The included man page gives some examples of how to configure FvwmIconMan, and
! a description of what it is, so I won't repeat it here.
! 
! If something needs to be tweaked to make this more portable, then feel free
! to inform me, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions towards
! improvement.
  
  I realize that the syntax for setting options is different from that used by
  other modules.
  
! I have discontinued support for fvwm 1. If you need to compile it for
! that version of fvwm, send me mail, and I'll tell you how. The version of
  FvwmIconMan included in the fvwm 2.0 distribution WILL NOT run under fvwm 1.

Hi everybody,

I'm tired to see my old poor xmailbox (an xbiff-like tool) and I
wonder if somebody knows (and uses) some pretty one.

I use the TaskBar module, Is it possible to insert some mini-icon or
mini-animation to show when a new mail arrives ? There is already the
time displayed, it can be fun to diplay a little mailbox flicking ...

Thanks in advance.

Jerome

Well, xmailbox++ supports colour xpm's so you can have a nice coloured
picture for no mail, and a nice coloured picture for mail. With a bit of 
effort you can make it look pretty good swallowed in a ButtonBar of some
sort.

Tkgoodstuff's Biff client doesn't do animations (check out "coolmail" for 
that), but does do multiple mailboxes (including MH and IMAP mailboxes), 
listing and reading new messages, different "alert levels" assigning different 
xpm icons to different mailboxes, all with GUI configuration.

http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff

Tkgoodstuff (a button bar with a lot of extra functionality, some of it 
connected with fvwm) is just about finalized for a "major release" (a 
once-a-year sort of thing).  So comments are very welcome.

Actually, it *is* text; it's just marked as the MIME type
"application/pgp" because ELM 2.4ME+ MIME-encodes plaintext-signed
messages.  You could use any *non*-MIME-aware tool to read them, if you
care to.

>Dan, any chance you can post without PGP features?

Well, I changed mailers again a while ago anyway; if I ever do end up
configuring it to PGP-sign my messages again, I'll make sure it does it
in the body only.

Apologies,

Incidentally, the correct-MIME-approach-of-the-day for PGP is now
PGP/MIME, not the old "application/pgp" stuff, which caused trouble
to everyone not using PGP. See <http://www.c2.org/~raph/pgpmime.html>
for more info.

This letter is signed using PGP/MIME. Hope you can read it. :-)

we could need more such people ...

I've reworked WindowList. (not FvwmWinList).
I've included your compile-time option into my patches, which I'll mail to
chuck, as soon as they're ready (tiny bug left, and it's late)
(well I wanted to check out your patch :-).

just to make your mouth watery:
I ripped out the [...] handling code from Circulate/Prev/Next/None and
used it for the new windowlist parameter handling.
Then I enhanced it, since this effort now paid at five different locations
:)

just think of:

Windowlist [!sticky !OnTop maximized CirculateSkip]
Windowlist [.iconic .sticky Xterm CurrentDesk]

(. means: don't care for this option
 +,& ... this option is required
 -,! ... this option is rejected )

Yes, I know, someone had to do it. Good job, Brady.

...

That's me, I think.

I just modified the one that I have(that is in Fvwm95)

It adds:

MiniIcon Support
ShowCurrentDesk option to only show Wins/Icons on Current Desk
Active Window Highlighting


Get it on my page:

Hi again

I modified FvwmTaskBar for the new MiniIcon patch.
(I dont use it, but did it anyway.)

Some modifications were specific to new Fvwm95 EVENTS. I used  
#ifdef FVWM95 for those.  I think the Auto Hide Functionally is disabled
because of this.

Get this FvwmTaskBar for Fvwm2(with MiniIcon patch) here:
http://www.donet.com/dmahurin/pub/FvwmTaskBar.don2.tgz

Have Fun.

I'm using xmailbox-2.4 (use archie to find it). It supports arbitrary
xpm's for full and empty mailboxes. Additionally has animation for
a full mailbox and can play a sound file on various platforms when
a mail arrives. I've got it running under Digital Unix 4.0 and
it says "You've got mail" when a mail arrives and the mailbox flashes.

Hi,

I installed fvwm, version 1.24r here and we are quite happy with it. Now that
we got used to it, we noticed a little bug.

When asking the user where to place a new window, there is an ungraceful
timeout of about 5 mins, after which fvwm would simply exit, killing all open
applications. This is unconvenient for certain netscape like applications which
pops out a new window after a long random loading time. If you let your
terminal unattended, you find it off when you come back.

A workaround would be to turn RandomPlacement on, but this would be a bit of a
pity...

I would like to know if this is fixed in version 2.xx (latest), in which case I
would simply install it. Please cc answer to my address, as I am not
subscribed.

Amities,

Hi,

A few hours ago I first read about the TaskBar module and, of course,
wanted to try it. But somehow, I'm not able to compile it. Here's what I
get when I do "teejay@Ferrenzo:~/fvwm-2.0.43/modules/FvwmTaskBar$ make":

******
gcc -O2 -m486 -ansi    -I. -I../..//libs  -I/usr/X11R6/include  -Dlinux
-D__i386__ -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_GNU_SOURCE -DX_LOCALE
-DFUNCPROTO=15 -DNARROWPROTO  -DSHAPE -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DMINI_ICONS -DXPM
-c FvwmTaskBar.c -o FvwmTaskBar.o
FvwmTaskBar.c: In function `main':
FvwmTaskBar.c:198: `M_MINI_ICON' undeclared (first use this function)
FvwmTaskBar.c:198: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
FvwmTaskBar.c:198: for each function it appears in.)
FvwmTaskBar.c: In function `ProcessMessage':
FvwmTaskBar.c:366: `M_MINI_ICON' undeclared (first use this function)
make: *** [FvwmTaskBar.o] Error 1
******

It doesn't matter if I start if from the source-root or from the
FvwmTaskBar-directory. I've tried several things, with and without
titlebar patches, with and without mini-icon patch etc. Also it didn't
really matter if I did "xmkmf;make Makefiles" of "MakeMakefiles".

Most of the times I did the following:

teejay@Ferrenzo:~$ tar -zxf fvwm-2.0.43.tar.gz
teejay@Ferrenzo:~$ cd fvwm-2.0.43/modules/
teejay@Ferrenzo:~/fvwm-2.0.43/modules$ tar -zxf 
   /home/teejay/FvwmTaskBar.don2.tgz
teejay@Ferrenzo:~/fvwm-2.0.43/modules$ cd
teejay@Ferrenzo:~$ patch -p0 < fvwm-2.0.43.mini-icon.diff
   (Renamed the mailed patch... BTW: This one gives the following errors:
   14 out of 20 hunks failed--saving rejects to
   fvwm-2.0.43/modules/FvwmIconMan/xmanager.c.rej)
teejay@Ferrenzo:~$ cd fvwm-2.0.43/
teejay@Ferrenzo:~/fvwm-2.0.43$ xmkmf;make Makefiles

After that "make". Everything goes well, except for the TaskBar-module.

Is there something I'm missing here? I've read the README in the TaskBar
dir, maybe there're other docs? Any help will be appreciated! :)

BTW: Before I forget it, I'm running Linux 2.0.21 and have never had
problems compiling fvwm2 before. Really! ;)

Is it possible to have a window that is sticky in only one desktop?  I would
like to have some windows stay put when I scroll the virtual desktop around
but I don't want them in every desktop.  The Sticky/Slippery style sticks
windows too well.

I think what I really want is for Sticky to just fix a window in place in
one desktop and for another attribute (LivesOn 1,2...) to control which
desktop(s) a window belongs to.

Any thoughts?
Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

After the MiniIcon Patch, and adding #define MINI_ICONS to fvwm.tmpl,
make sure you MakeMakefiles and remake everything.

It worked fine for me.

You have to apply Bradys MiniIcon Patch.
And Put #define MINI_ICONS in your fvwm.tmpl

I didnt bother #ifdefing all the MINI_ICON references. 
Maybe I could do that.

I put another #ifdef MINI_ICONS in the code, and in the default Makefile
there has no -DMINI_ICONS.

Works fine.

The README in the that directory lists some places to get icons, and
the locations of the FvwmWinList and FvwmTaskBar patches as well.

I'm trying to install Fvwm2 onto a Sparc running SunOs 4.1.3
without root privelage.  I read through the faq and mailing
list archive, but still couldn't get it to work.

I think my biggest problem is a lack of understanding of xmkmf
and imake.  I've been reading the man's, still no luck.

Below is the response I get.  I couldn't find the "depend" target
anywhere (imake.tmpl, Imakefile, etc...).  Do I need a certain
rev of X (X11R6?)?  How can I check to see what my current rev 
is?  For some reason, the X lib's and includes aren't in the
"usual" places on my system.  But, I think I got that part 
straightened out.

Anyway, any solutions/tips/clues would greatly be appreciated.
Please send me an email to kwerner@ictest.delcoelect.com.  I'm
not subscribed to the list currently, because I'm using fvwm1;
most of the discussion seems to be about fvwm2.

Thanks for your time,
Kevin

        Hi there! I am currently using an old version of FVWM 1.something
and I was wondering if it was possible to alternate different colors in one
menu, such such, green for Network apps and Red for Leisure apps, is it
possible? How?

        Thanx

I've put the following lines in my .fvwm2rc95 :

*FvwmTaskBarUpdateInterval 10
*FvwmTaskBarBellVolume 20
*FvwmTaskBarMailBox /var/mail/gout 
*FvwmTaskBarMailCommand Exec color_xterm -T Mail -ls -fn 8x13 -e pine -i

But nothing appends ...

Have somebody any advices for this ??

Thanks a lot in advance

Jerome

I figured out the problem, and provided a patch to the author (using
the mailto link on the FVWM-95 home page).  However, the email bounced
and I figured that since this mailing list isn't really about fvwm95,
I didn't post it here.

Quick answer:  Set your MAIL environment variable to the mailbox you
want it to check.  The '*FvwmTaskBarMailBox' parameter is NOT
correctly parsed due to a problem in the code.  If you'd prefer,
send email to me and I'll send you the patch.

This is my only comment on this mailing list about fvwm95 and its task
bar module.  I apologize to everybody else in this group in advance
about the slight stray from the main topic.  (Keep up the good work on
fvwm2, Chuck!)

Hi, a brief note about the (very spiffy looking) patch to allow pixmap
borders on windows...

I've been messing with mine this morning and while the patch works fine it would
be much easier to work with if highlight colour (and normal border colour)
were ignored and superseded by a colour chosen from the pixmap being used.
Otherwise the results can be predictably horrible.

But what I wanted to address was a 'buglet' in the patch, when I move out in or
out of a window with two solid colours being used for the titlebar (active,
inactive) the background borderpixmap flashes through causing a nasty
flickering effect. Its not nice! And there is no need for it to appear,
any chance of getting this fixed? (I know its only a silly patch but still...)

I thought about this, but of course, if you randomly choose a pixmap
it can also look horrible.  I decided not to complicate things for now
at this stage.  Maybe in the future, or if someone adds this feature.

This is really just because of the expose events being flushed
sequentially (maybe I could try flushing the expose events somewhere
along the line, might try this weekend --).  I notice it slightly on
my machine but not at all on the SGI (too fast :). It *always*
happened, even before the patch, but it takes longer to draw pixmaps.
The problem with background pixmaps is that clearing the window
effectively draws the pixmap.

This was one reason I was reluctant to to try this type of thing, but
on the Indy it is really fast though.  If, during development, some
way can be found to speed up transitions, however, it will definately
be taken.  One thing which was speeded up was closing non-transient
windows, but transients still flash the background (still working on
that).  Also I am still working on HiddenHandles for non-MWMBorder
windows.

Take care,
Andy

Hi,

The Task bar module make a tip window with "You have (new) mail" write
when I receive new mails.

I've write a little code, which parses the mailbox file and write on
cout the From and the Subject line for each mail. I use this program
piped in Xterm.

It would be perfect if I could display a sort of tip window in which I
write those informations. Just by moving the mouse, we can see who
writes to us and the subject of the email.

Who can tell me what modifications in sources are needed to achieve
this goal ?

Thanks in advance

Jerome

I am using fvwm2.0.43 build on solaris2.5.1   I am having
problems with the drag feature in FvwmPager when dragging
a window across desktops onto the active window.


X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter
attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  6910
  Current serial number in output stream:  6910


This seems to be highly intermittent, happening every 2 or
three drags sometimes and as infrequently as 30 drags at
others.  The pager dies and has to be restarted.   Is this
a know problem?  Anyone got any ideas?

I have been unable to get cut & paste (mouse operations) to work.  Is it 
because I only have a two button mouse?
Any help would be appreciated.

I don't know if you're using XFree86 or another X server ... but in XFree
you have to have `Emulate3Buttons' set. Then, hitting both left&right
mouse buttons simultaneously will be equal to the middle mouse button
(which acts as paste in many apps) on a 3 button mouse.

Hope this helps

patch (including man pages) at:
	<URL:http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at:80/~albrecht>

attached a small overview over the new features.

check it out,
Bugs not reported till Okt 1st have to be take care of by YOU

(You see, the men in green will take me away.
It'll take for at least a month, till I can look into my account again.)
I've finally put my money where my mouth was, and put a week of effort into
this. 

Hope, you can use it.
Hope it finds it's way into the release.

User level changes:

MenuStyle forecolor backcolor shadecolor font style mousewarp

	mousewarp separated from mwm/fvwm distinction

Popup PopupName command
Menu MenuName double_click_action command
	optional Command parameter

Prev [condition] command
Next [condition] command
None [condition] command
	enhanced condition to recognize all binary style flags
	and "WindowID #"
	(is there any test, if a windowid is valid, fvwm coredumps, 
	if the user hardcodes an invalid windowid ?) 
	(PS to Chuck: I'd still like to have the functions that need a
	window parse an optional numeric windowID argument.)

WindowList option[condition] command
	included #ifdef MINI_ICON support (by Brady Montz)
	added IconName, Geometry, MiniIcon & Sorted option
	added condition (a'la Prev/Next/None)
	added optional command (a'la Menu/PopUp) to WindowList,

	I now use:
	WindowList -geometry+miniicon[.iconic-sticky-ontop-circulateskip]

	and 
	AddToFunc WindowListFunction "I" Next [windowid $0] focus
	+			"I"	Next [windowid $0] raise
	+			"I"	Next [windowid $0] iconify -1



this all uses my reworked library (somewhat):

	it's a drop in of current lib.

	prototypes added to fvwmlib.h
		(module authors should include fvwmlib.h and remove  
		lib prototypes from their files in the long run)
	
	provided parsetables concept to get rid of endless 
		if (!mystrcasecmp(line,"Windowlistskip",14))
		parsing constructs for binary options.

	consistent use of isspace() ... macros
		(they're faster than if's anyway) 

	MatchToken
		faster way to parse options than mystrncasecmp
		currently there's a 
		#define mystrncasecmp(a,b,n) (!MatchToken(a,b))
		to use the new function for parsing
		(mystrncasecmp was _never_ used for anything else)
		This will vanish as soon as the last mystrncasecmp
		vanishes.

	SkipSpaces & other handy macros (ripped from here & there)

	stripcpy merged with CopyString
		they both did the same, but had different weaknesses
		#defined CopyString using stripcpy

	#define SendInfo SendText
		since they were the same anyway.

	seekright()
		This should be the base for consistent parsing in
		fvwm: if only this function is used, quoting will be
		consistent throughout .fvwm2rc.

		If you need extended functionality, add it here, so
		everybody will benefit. (e.g: I could imagine moving
		the environment variable expansion in here)

	#define GetNextToken with seekright() 
		(ripped from FvwmButtons, thanks, Jarl)

		This is an attempt to clear the quoting jungle:
		(somewhere there's NO quote parsing, somplace
		GetNextToken() was used, and somewhere seekright() was
		used, with GetNextToken being halfways between the
		other two possibilities.

		This could have serious effects on existing .fvwm2rc
		files, since it makes the quoting djungle more
		consistent, therefore there are now less places where
		unquoted (backslashed) quotes are handed down to the 
		application.
		My .fvwm2rc works without changes.

		When all occurences of GetNextToken are replace by
		seekright, this macro will vanish.
		GetNextToken might then reappear with a new parameter
		format and new semantic (maybe non-malloc-copying)

		(I would have liked to keep the name GetNextToken,
		but it simply has the worse Interface.)
	
BUGS:
	on a last glance the menu delimiters don't seem to work any more.
	will look into this tomorrow.

b) If it is posible to snap icons to a grid

and if so , how so...


Thanks in advance ( and could you CC any replies to me.)

Hi everyone.

I'm new to the list, so sorry if this has already been discussed.

I think it's very useful to put "unofficial patches" into the
FVWM Official Page.

Alternatively, it would be useful to put a list of links pointing
to those patches.

When I say "unofficial patches", I mean patches like mini icons,
vertical title bar, texture mapped border and so on.

What do you think?

Ciao,

Hi,

I had a  quick think re: my gripe about pixmap borders and 
highlight colours. Basically my problem is that I use the same
pixmap for active/inactive windows (I just rely on titlebar
colour to indicate focus). The highlight and ordinary 
style "*" colour must be set in such a way that it doesn't look
terrible against the chosen pixmap. So I use the same colour for
highlight and inactive borders (the titlebar indicates focus
anyway).

The problem is that when scooting over my icons its not very
obvious which one has the focus as the colours don't change.
The functionality of a highcolour is still needed in this case.

I'd like a very different colour for highlighted icons while
retaining the same highlighted/ordinary colour for pixmaped
border windows. Might I suggest extending (and slightly
complicating, but only slightly) the pixmap borders patch to
include a config file line like "Icon highlight colour"
or something. Most fvwm users will be fine with this, but
for "pixmap border patch" users this would be useful.
I reckon this would be very simple to implement.

A suggestion would be to try installing it in your home directory,
then write down everything you needed to do and tell root to do it
again.

You can change all the directories in the Fvwm.tmpl file, I think.
Only problem is that `make install' will maybe install stuff in the
wrong place.  For that, you have variables BINDIR, MANDIR, LIBDIR and
suchlike, new values of which you can just put in the Imakefile.

Then, there's this problem of Imake not finding mkdirhier if BINDIR is
changed.  Solve this by setting MKDIRHIER to the right thing (maybe
/usr/bin/X11/mkdirhier, or /usr/X11/bin/mkdirhier, or
/usr/dt/bin/mkdirhier, or whatever).

hth,

Why stop at icon highlight colour? If the Great Style Flag ReWrite goes

IconHighlightColour, Colour, and IconColour, and make them appicable on 
a per window basis. I mean one thing that stuck me as a bit daft, was having
a global highlight colour when you can make all your other windows different
colours. The same sort of thing applies to attributes like TitleStyle and 
font and so on. The more of these things that can be applied per window
the better, in my (somewhat self-centred opinion). It's what puts the F into FVWM... Fun. Flexibility. take your pick.

I have to disagree, I install fvwm as a non-root user and have much less
trouble. I basically edit fvwm.tmpl and thats it! xmkmf etc all work
fine after that (provided your sysadmin has Imake set up properly.)

No trouble at all, much better than the installation process used to be.
The way I do it if I need root is to install it myself, go and find
someone with root, show them, and then tell them what to type to
install it properly.

fvwm is actually very easy to install, one of the many points in its
favour.

As it turns out, the "maybe" in that second line above is important;
the installation of fvwm does NOT require you to change BINDIR and
friends.  Thanks to David for pointing this out.

So, the stuff about BINDIR applies to many other Imake programs but
not to fvwm.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

no, it's f!@#%$^ (the CDA doesn't apply to me, since I'm european :-)
small memory footprint, which is certainly a thing.

All those option are currently in a big (>2 Pages) structure, which is
allocated for every window. And those options want to be set, too.

How much of those options do you actially use ?
I have some 5 styles defined ("Undecorated", "Emacs", "Xterm", "Netscape"
and one or two derivatives)
Ok, we don't all use the same 5 styles, but I guess no one uses more than
20 of over a billion possibilities (just a wild guess, probably higher).
This cries for a sparse table or packed solution.

A lot of the config space could be saved, if we attach "style packets" to a
window: every window has just a linked list ptr, pointing to a chain of
"styling packets" which are traversed when the window is redrawn.
	set_backcolor, set_forecolor, set_icon color, ... 

there doesn't have to be just one list:
there could be one for each major "state" of the window i.e:
	IconStyle ->		{ fg_color blue, ... }
	IconFocusStyle ->	{ fg_color skyblue, ... }
	WindowStyle ->		{ fg_color green, ... }
	WindowFocusStyle ->	{ fg_color red, ... }
	TransientStyle ->	{ no icons }
	
splitting is done while parsing:
	IconStyle "*" ...  IconFocusStyle "*" ...)
	IconStyle "transient"	nomapping, no decorations, 
				windolistskip, circulateskip, ....

or by using prefixes for actual style commands:
	Style "transient" icon unmapped, window mapped, 
			  icon WindowlistSkip, 
			  windowfocus color black/red,
			  window color black/blue

by UseStyle "transient", the pointer is appended to the linked list.
Inheritance is still possible (the latter packet overwrites former
definitions - there's a bitmap which options are "active")

One can have as many styles, as one wants. Bloatage^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hmemory
usage is linear to these wants.
If I only define 5 styles, only five style packets are allocated in my
system, since the windows are pointer-linked to them.)

The size of the style struct is nearly unimportant then, since bloatage
comes from the number of styles defined (=number of style packets), which
is << the number of windows, since it's limited by the patience of the
user, when changing his .fvwm2rc.

Speed is no limitation either, since there is only little pointer
dereferencing involved (we're not talking about users defining 200+ styles
here).

/begin rant
	We could add a Startupfunctions to the style, which could solve
	things like StartsOn, ... by using Goto and would open infinite
	possibilities. This can really be interpreted, since it's only 
	used once, before & after the window is mapped.
/end rant


any takers, I don't have the time now, since I'm doing my military service
from next tuesday on.

  Except maybe for the Icon (and now MINI_ICON) Style...

Feel free to use it as you like, I did the same with fvwm-2.0.43, which led
to this patch.

The seekright implementation is not optimal (that's the menu-nop bug,
fixed by now) and anotehr bug if you use excessive function hierarchies and
therefore excessive quoting.

I'll followup with a new version, probably today, maybe tomorrow.

Use #define OLD_GETNEXTTOKEN in fvwmlib.h till then.

I have 90 Style lines in my .fvwmrc. About half of these are exclusively
Icon definitions  The others all define various properties for the windows
along the lines of Stickyness, BorderWidth and the rest.  If I could set 
different windows to have different title styles I would. If I could do it
with less memory usage, so much the better. However, I'm not really

As I said, I define a large number of icons. This takes up a large chunk
of my .fvwmrc file. Can anybody suggest how I could remove the icon 
defintions to another file (.icons  ?) ??

Quite a lot, how may windows do you have open, under normal conditions ?
You must have a 10:1 ratio between active windows and style definitions ...
Do you _really_ need another icon for each and every window ? ... alas, it
should be possible. (those, who want bloatage, will get bloatage, anyway.)

I don't think there's no tradeoff to be made.
One unsigned long for frequently used binary options,
and two pointers for icons should be affordable in the basic window
structure (I myself only use icons/miniicons to make the application class
visible at first glance.)

Or one separate pointer to a

struct IconPointers
{	IconPtr,
	MiniIconPtr, 
	Border_XPM_Ptr, 
	ButtonPixmapPtrs[10]
}
so the memory usage scales with your usage of different icons again.

There doesn't seem to be any support for this in X.
Dare I say, Windows-95 is miles ahead, with each Application supporting
it's icon & miniicon. :-)

So Fvwm has to supply the icons to the applications, so it has to have a
lookup table. You can
	Read ~/.icons
	do an FvwmIconHandler module
	tweak m4
	is there an *icon resource this would move the stuff to .Xdefaults.

but you won't get around the lookuptable, untill every application supplies
it's icons.

You could split you .fvwmrc into separate file and use FvwmM4/Cpp to
reassemble them at startup time.

An idea for the Fvwm hackers would be for fvwm to look for an icon in the
PixmapPath that matches the window name (or icon name) and use that by default.
That way you would only have to copy the icon you want to the appropriate file
name and fvwm would use it.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

To be honest I could shift a whole bundle completely, but I'd still use
a whole lot of icons for things. When I'm working (as opposed to just 
sitting here playing with the pretty borders) I'll have about ten or so windows
up (couple of Xterms, an XGterm running IRAF with a Tek Window open, XImtool, 
a Nedit's or two, probably mailtool half the time...)  Then I'll open something else and, because I'm on a fairly small screen here, I'll have to iconify
something to find a space to put it, and then do it in reverse to switch 
back.... 
If they're all question marks then it _looks_ bad. Icons are cosmetic
measures,  you could easily have just the title-bar sat there but who
wants that?

I guess this big active:style ratio must be a Boy Scout thing... 
Be Prepared! Dib! Dib! Dib!.     ;)

hmmm... The directory trees are not the same. If you want to set up a
FvwmIconHandler, you'll quickly see that all your .icon files will be
in /bin/ /usr/bin/ /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/X11/bin directories and not
in c:/gimp/ or /utils/seyon/...

Tim> You could split you .fvwmrc into separate file and use FvwmM4/Cpp to

Or if the extra preprocessing isn't needed, simply extract the
relevant sections to another file (.fvwm2rc.icons) and replace it with
a simple "Read .fvwm2rc.icons".

I believe that this could be done in a module (FvwmIconChoser?)
without too much difficulty (also likely the only way it'd ever get
into fvwm).  I might have to add the ability to recapture a single
window though (which I planned to do eventually) to get it to truly
work correctly.

	Hello. I just picked up a copy of fvwm and am currently trying to
install it on an SGI, and am having some problems doing so. I'm not sure 
if this is the correct place to ask about that, so I won't post any error
messages yet. Would someone be so kind as to direct me to the correct spot 
to request assistance for installation of fvwm?

Thanks,

I use this line:

I guess that refers to the Prev and Next functions, now.  But I don't

right, Prev/Next/None only find windows without the CirculateSkip style.

This is the place.  I believe there are a few people on the list who
have had experience with fvwm on sgi machines, so ask away and someone
should be able to help.

Send me the error logs... worse come to worse, I've done it on 5.2 and

You can find strcasecmp in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a

Change the following line in your Makefile and rebuild:

  EXTRA_LIBRARIES = -lnsl -lsocket -lc -L/usr/ucblib -lucb

Do a man strcasecmp and read the page. It should indicate in which
library this function is hidden. If not, well, I'd assume it is in libc. 
Thus I'd add a -lc at the end of the compilation(actually linking)
command. This should fix this.

Well, I survived my first foray into the guts of Fvwm 2.0.43. :-) I
think I killed a major nit with using Fvwm on a dual-headed display
(FTR: Sparc 5, Solaris 2.5, OpenWindows 3.5).  The patch seems really
simple and so far I haven't noticed any evil side effects, so I'm
hoping it'll make it into the next major release.  I'll first explain
the problem, give the fix, then give a few other comments on Fvwm's
dual-headed support.

The Problem:

On screen 0, bring up an xterm and place it on the root window such
that there are no other windows between it and the edge of screen 1.
You will want focus-follows-mouse mode (note I explicitly do not use
sloppy focus).  Put the cursor in the xterm and observe how key press
events properly go to the xterm.

Now start to slide the cursor over to screen 1.  It doesn't matter
whether the cursor crosses screen 0's root window or not, but the
cursor should enter screen 1's root window without ever crossing any
other windows on either screen.  Start hitting keypresses and watch as
they are bogusly directed to screen 0!  Note that if the xterm is
jammed against the side of screen 0, such that moving the cursor to
screen 1 does *not* cross screen 0's root, keypresses in screen 1's
root will get directed to the xterm.  If the crossing did cross screen
0's root, the keypresses will be directed to screen 0's root window.

The Fix:

Add another test to the SetFocus() conditional inside the test of
Event.xany.window == SrcRoot in events.c:HandleEnterNotify() [SEE
PATCH BELOW].  The only attribute I could find to test on is
Scr.Focus.  During debugging, I noticed that in all bogus cases, the
SetFocus() clause was not being entered because the test failed.  It
failed because Scr.Focus == 0, which makes some sense.  I think the
only time this happens is when the cursor moves across screen
boundaries, so I think the change is safe.  It does at least seem to
fix the problem in all situations described above.

I'd love for others with dual-heads to check this out, and if it looks
okay, *please* for Chuck to add this patch to the final release!

The Patch:

Of course feel free to wax the commentary in this patch. :-) Without
that, its a one line change!

-------------------- snip snip --------------------

More on Dual-Headedness:

I still think ctwm 3.3 handles dual-headedness better than Fvwm.
During debugging of this problem I noticed that the way Fvwm handles
the presence of multiple screens is to fork off a clone of itself for
each screen.  I surmise this is primarily because there is only one
global ScreenInfo structure, and so much of the code refers to it
through Scr.<whatever>.

I quickly peeked at ctwm's startup and noticed it doesn't do things
this way.  It actually has an array of ScreenInfo's, one for each
screen, and the global Scr is a pointer into this array.  So it
accesses the current screen with Scr-><whatever>.  So there is only
one ctwm process (no forking), and I think that makes more sense.

I'm sure the differences are somewhat more substantial, but I didn't
look into it in great detail.  As it stands (with this patch), Fvwm is
much more usable now.  Certainly such restructuring needn't happen
until after the next major release, but I wanted to bring your
attention to the difference.  Hopefully this can be improved in the
future.  I'd say, rip off as much from ctwm as possible.  In all other
respects, Fvwm is a better window manager.

Thanks, and keep up the great work!

-Barry

[P.S. Some time, I'll post my thoughts on integrating a Python
interpreter into Fvwm, a la PyApache, the HTTP server with an
integrated Python interpreter]

I had earlier sought help on building fvwm and sent the following
info. BTW, I was using an ANSI c compiler only.

Finally managed to build it. And run it for about 5 to 1o minutes.
And then suddenly it dies or something, I get back to ASCII
mode from where I would have started the xinit etc.

Pl. let me know if I missed something.

I am using fvwm2.0.43, built on solaris2.5.1   I am having
problems with the drag feature in FvwmPager when dragging
a window across desktops onto the active window.


X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter
attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  6910
  Current serial number in output stream:  6910


This seems to be highly intermittent, happening every 2 or
three drags sometimes and as infrequently as 30 drags at
others.  The pager dies and has to be restarted.   Is this
a know problem?  Anyone else see this?   Anyone working with
the pager point me at how to resolve this or suggest a
possible work around?

But, the Prev/Next functions don't seem to scroll round a list of windows.
Repeated use of Prev seems to jump back and foward --- it seems that the
prev is raised, but the current is not sent to the bottom. Hence the current
window becomes the previous window when Prev is applied again.

It's still in the 2.0.43 release but in the  directory "extras".
However, it's been superseded i  the release by the 
somewhat more versatile (and in my opinion better), FvwmButtons.

The version of fvwm you used on your Linux box must have been
1.summat as that is when 'goodstuff' was used.

Fvwm2 (the current release) has a module called FvwmButtons which
is a much improved version of 'goodstuff'. Have a read at the man-page
for FvwmButtons, much of it should be familiar.

I assume you are using fvwm 2.xx, which hasn't been officially
released yet by the way (still beta), since GoodStuff is "gone" in
there.  The answer is in the FAQ which was included in the tar file
(replaced by/renamed to FvwmButtons, which has been greatly enhanced
as well).

I did see this message when you posted it to the list, but I was
hoping that someone would say "yes, I've seen that" because I haven't.
And debugging problems that I can't reproduce is obviously difficult
(and I have a few of those queued up too).

What version of 2.xx exactly?  'fvwm2 -version' will tell you.  Also,

Well, now that I think about it I seem to recall some discussion about
something like this in the past...  Hmm...

Ok, a quick search of the fvwm mailing list archives (found on the
official web site - a handy thing indeed) for "pager;X_SetInputFocus"
reveals a note & subsequent threads about this in the past (under
Solaris 2.x).  The original poster claimed that an included patch to
x_pager.c in the FvwmPager directory worked for them, but I didn't
really like the solution at the time, which apparently is why I didn't
include it then.

So, try this patch:

I seem to recall not really liking that fix, but give it a try and see
how it works for you.  If it seems to fix things for you, let me know.
I'm putting it into the next release anyways (it really shouldn't hurt
anything, I guess, even if it's not an elegant solution).

Yeah, it's pretty tough sometimes.

That's correct - I don't see this (but then I normally only use one
desk and I rarely drag windows out of the pager like that, but trying
to reproduce it just now I was unsuccessful).

Ugh.  Well, I hope this works so you can give them a good demo of
fvwm.  I think (hope) that for the most part they'll like fvwm better.
Also, take a look at the Red Hat under the desktop contest winners
section - someone made fvwm2 look an awful lot like the COSE desktop
using some special pixmaps and the FvwmButtons module...

Hope I've been of assistance.

Hi,

I read the man pager for FvwmPager but cannot see any way to turn off
the desktop titles.  I'm swallowing FvwmPager in tkgoodstuff and would
like to do away with the Desktop titles if possible.

Thanks,

Hi,

If I start up two copies of FvwmPager in exactly the same manner I
they are slightly different sizes.  This is driving me crazy.

If I link FvwmPager to say LABPager, copy the *FvwmPager lines in my
.fvwm2rc to *LABPager lines, restart fvwm and start FvwmPager and
LABPager in the same way they have substantially different sizes
(mostly in width).  THis is really driving me crazy.

I am using a 1x1 DeskTopSize and invoking the Pager as FvwmPager 0 3
or LABPager 0 3 in order to get 4 desktops.  My rc lines look like:

*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048
*FvwmPagerHilight #cab3ca
*FvwmPagerFont none
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 6x10
*FvwmPagerGeometry 210x40
*FvwmPagerColumns 4
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Home
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Work
*FvwmPagerLabel 2 Web
*FvwmPagerLabel 3 Misc

*LAB1PagerBack #908090
*LAB1PagerFore #484048
*LAB1PagerHilight #cab3ca
*LAB1PagerFont none
*LAB1PagerSmallFont 6x10
*LAB1PagerGeometry 210x40
*LAB1PagerColumns 4
*LAB1PagerLabel 0 Home
*LAB1PagerLabel 1 Work
*LAB1PagerLabel 2 Web
*LAB1PagerLabel 3 Misc


Also, neither window created is sized at 210x40!

I am running fvwm2.0.43 on an R4000 SGI Indy compiled with SGI's cc.

FvwmAudio (rsynth say or arbitrary command / parameter support)
FvwmAuto (arbitrary command support, don't use "close" with a low timeout :)

both as patch and .tar.gz

FvwmAuto.c has grown by -876 bytes (hmm... should be called "shrunk")

I released version 0.8 of FvwmIconMan. You can get it at:
ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan-0.8.tar.gz

It contains the miniicon stuff (handled a little bit better than the
rough one that was contained in that mega miniicons patch I mailed in 
last week), and more importantly, it tries to minimize the number of
times it redraws the manager windows when you switch pages. 

You don't need the miniicons patch to compile this version, it works fine 
without it.

I took the FvwmIconMan stuff out of the miniicons patch on mahler as
well.

Hi, found an old crashed & forgotten mail to the list:

just wondering...

I looked into FvwmButtons, to see if it were possible to swallow a window
via

SendToModule FvwmButtons *FvwmButtons(4x2, \
	Swallow xload "exec rsh remotemachine xload -d $HOSTDISPLAY")

but it doesn't look like, and it doesn't look like modification is easy for
me either (don't know any of the internals)

I think the pipe is just used for configuration during startup.
Then FvwmButtons goes into the X event loop - no more parameters acepted.

I think, one would have to do sth along
	fork()
	forever
	{	wait for input on pipe
		parse_input
	}
		
where parse_input accepts new "swallow" commands, & does a reshuffle &
redisplay.

there's just one drawback to this solution: the new swallowed apps are
added at the end, without any control over placement & ordering.

To be able to add an icon to the nth container level, the syntax would have
to be extended drastically.

hmm...,
don't know what to do with this now, just thought, I'd post it,
maybe Jarl is already back and it triggers a thought.

Oh good.  I was going to chat with you about that, because with lots
of windows on each page it would take several seconds to redraw when I
tested it last.  I'll have to check out the improvement!

Oh good.  But I've decided to try and make everyone happy on this one
and actually add the mini icon support.  Since it's #ifdef'ed in
there, I guess it won't hurt anything.  As I've said in the past I
don't like all these #ifdef's in there for various features, but I've
decided that it's the only way to get closer to pleasing everyone.

Which brings me to another point.  Between that, adding Andrew's
Titlebar pixmap patch (without the border textures just yet, although
I may merge some variant of that in as well), the patches from
Albrecht, and all the other stuff that I've put into my local
development version, I think one more beta before 2.1.0 might be in
order.

I really didn't want to do that, but I made the mistake of taking too
long to get it out and feeling the "need" to put a lot of things in.

So, since there will be one more beta, I also would like to take care
of a few more things, like ressurrecting CursorStyle and TogglePaging,
plus some other stuff from the TO-DO list that I think should probably
get done before 2.1.0 now that I've thought about it some more.

I'd like to get 2.0.44 out within a few weeks (it'll probably take a
little bit to pull all this together) then I'd like to get 2.1.0 out
no more than a week or two after that (with NOTHING but bugfixes and
absolute necessites so it won't get delayed again).  Then the
semi-mythical Great Style Flags Rewrite and general code cleanup for
the next beta releases (2.2.x) sometime after that (along with
official 2.1.x bugfix and minor enhancement releases, which I'm sure
will be needed).

Sound good?

Well, gotta get back to my weekend...

Does anyone know how to capture a screen-shot under X-Windows ?

I am using FVWM (under Linux).  Is there a way to ask the X server
(in this case XFree86) or the window manager (fvwm) to take a snapshot
of the screen and save it as an image ? I looked at the manual of FVWM
but couldn't find the answer.

Please copy the answer to my email address! Thanks!

xwd and xv are two programs that I know of that will allow you to `dump` 
or `grab` the screen, respectively.  xwd is strictly command line, 
whereas xv is point and click.

This is an X server issue, not a wm issue.

You can do 'xwd -root' or use the grab function of xv, and I think
there are more utilities knocking around that do much the same thing.

Great, I'm pleased to see Andrew's patch going in. However, I feel
that it should include the ability to specify a foreground colour
for the titlebar, too. For example I have a solid light colour for
inactive windows, but dark for active, and need to change the text
colour accordingly.

A while back I submitted a patch to the patch that allowed, e.g.
  TitleStyle ActiveUp (Solid White/MediumPurple)
which corresponds to the standard fvwm colour-selecting syntax.
Unfortunately there's a bug in my code, but I'll try to fix
it in the next couple of days.

A weekend is that time when it takes ages for other people to
answer mail and talk requests. It sometimes takes several days.
I can't imagine what they are thinking. Perhaps they're in the
middle of a _really_ intensive game of Doom. It usually takes
about two days and happens five days after the previous one
ended.

I don't think weekends are the same as vacations. They look the
same, but vacations happen more irregularly and can take several
weeks at a time. Also, vacations seems to cause changes in skin
color for some people, but it doesn't seem to last for very long.
(Too bad, a bit of variation is always helpful for those awful
face-to-face meetings. Why can't people just send me mail.)

Hello Tristan,

I have two ways of getting Screenshots. One is "directly to printer" and
is done as an additional "Print" command in the window's pulldown menu
(the Hardcopy script tries to detect if the caught window has portrait or
landscape format and rotates it by 90 degrees if necessary):

#### from: ~/.fvwm2rc95, works on any recent fvwm-2
AddToMenu "Window-Ops2" "&Restore"        Iconify -1
+                       "&Move"           Move-or-Raise
+                       "&Size"           Resize-or-Raise
+                       "&Lower"          Lower
+                       "Mi&nimize"       Iconify 1
+                       "Ma&ximize"       Maximize 100 100
+                       "&Print"          PrintFunction $w
+                       ""                Nop
+                       "&Kill"           Destroy
+                       "&Close	Alt+F4"   Delete

# Private: Print current window
AddToFunc PrintFunction		"I" Raise
+                               "I" Exec /home/martin/BIN/Hardcopy $w $1

...and the other is used with the Ctrl-[Print] key (it doesn't actually
print but invokes xv to pre-view the currently active window's snapshot
for saving or printing):

#### from: ~/.fvwm2rc95, works on any recent fvwm-2
Key Print       WIFST   C       Exec /home/martin/BIN/xvHardCopy $w $1

<<Note: I've tried fiddling about with the $w parameter, but somehow it
works only in special places... Gotta re-read the man page for this. The
way I did it here works - even if it's incorrect>>

Then there are the two scripts Hardcopy and xvHardCopy which get the
window (including frame) using the ImageMagick "import" function, the
first one is rotating automatically if necessary.

<<Note: You'll have to adapt the paths and the lp/lpr printing parameters
as this is for the non-Linux system I'm using here>>

Is it possible you have done another patch before this one? I had simular
problems with both aplying the title-patch and mini-icons, just won't
work. I thought, I'll do it by hand and make another patch, but haven't
had the time to do so yet... :(

It's only useful if the caller of the function was able to supply a window
parameter, which is not the case, if a menu is brought up from the root.

I hoped this would happen, as it's been way time that some things were

Do you plan on changing some names, before releasing this beta or the final
2.1 (seekright -> GetNextToken is on my wishlist, if GetNextToken is rooted
out)
Just after inclusion of all relevant patches and before the release would be
the optimal time.

and we did ours and sent patches :-)
I think it's for the benefit of everyone: no one wants to change such
things after the official release (this would mean more questions of the
form:  "Are you using 1.24, 2.0 or 2.1 beta ?")

good. this will halve the travel on the list:

This is the first major release of tkgoodstuff (a kitchen-sink tcl/tk button 
bar) in a year.  If you've been following the beta's, don't get too excited, 
it's just a (hopefully) stable distribution of the existing feature set.

An idea struck me that might be possible; but I'm not sure how much
rewrite it would take (most likely a _lot_).  Since #ifdef's are the
Achilles Heel of programming (and nobody really likes them), would it
be possible to rewrite some or all of FVWM in an "Apache" manner,
i.e., using "modules" to implement different features?  I don't recall
too many #ifdefs; Apache just "knows" there's a module built in.  In
fact, it would allow one to link in, say mini-icons, without
rebuilding the entire FVWM.

Obviously, something of this magnitude would have to wait for the
Great Rewrite (2.1), if it were even considered.  I've never dived too
deep into the Apache nor the FVWM2 code, but would be willing.
Unfortunately, my knowledge of X is very, very limited. :(

Comments? Flames? Scapegoats?

You've got the Makefiles using gcc with the SGI cc's command line
options.  Make sure you have the correct setttings for FvwmCompiler
and FvwmCompilerFlags in Fvwm.tmpl

Not sure why you are having this trouble, but if you hold on for a
couple of weeks, the mini icon support will be in 2.0.44.

Correct your imake-setup. These strange compile options come
from your local setup, not from fvwm.

P.S.: Imake could be a great help, if it were installed properly
at every site, but it can also be a nightmare if it isn't :-/

I think it's a great idea.  I haven't dived into Apache too deeply,
but there's work in the Python community on PyApache, where a Python
interpreter is embedded in the server and Python modules are written
to extend the functionality of the server.  Seems to me that Python
has all the necessary bits to make it an excellent candidate for such
a thing in Fvwm.  I'm pretty sure it has an Xlib module, and I know it
has higher level toolkits too.  The Fvwm core could do the
time-intensive stuff and make calls into the Python interpreter in
response to Fvwm's high level view of events.  Fvwm would definite an
API (embodied as a Python module) for useful things like warping the
cursor, moving focus around, (de)iconifing windows, etc.  Python
modules could import this and make appropriate calls.

I think it would run pretty fast too since (my guess is that) most of
the overhead in the current Python-Fvwm module interface is starting
up the Python interpreter every time.

Try doing xmkmf -a instead of the make Makefiles. But the real problem
is that your imake setup is trying to use gcc (GNU C) instead of cc
(SGI C). The options passed to gcc here are really for cc. You really
need to correct your imake setup, but you *might* get away with
saying
    % xmkmf -a
    % make CC=cc

I get fvwm2 to compile very cleanly using cc on Irix 5.3/6.1/6.2.

I just tried the patch and it only works a little better for me.  It
seems to only do the right thing when there are no windows that accept
focus on the second screen.  For example:

    screen0: nothing
    screen1: xterm
    screen2: nothing

If I move the mouse out of the xterm on screen1 and onto screen2, the
xterm cursor is no longer solid and focus appears to really be on
screen2.  (I use sloppyfocus)

But, if the screens are like this:

    screen0: nothing
    screen1: xterm
    screen2: xterm

When I move the mouse out of the xterm on screen1 and onto the blank
screen on screen2 (not touching the xterm on screen2), focus is still
in the xterm on screen1.

Anything else I can try?

I just got a replacement keyboard (old one died under warranty), and
the new one has those annoying Windows keys.  I thought it would be
useful to have the WindowList on one, so I could easily switch windows
with the kbd.

Unfortunately, while the 1.x Windowlist warped the pointer to the
window and focussed it, the 2.x one does not.  I can't use
FvwmWinList, because it apparently doesn't have a kbd interface.

Is there any way to use WindowList and give the selected window focus?
Or an alternative window list with a kbd interface?
