First, did you run "xmkmf" before doing "make install"?

Second, have you set the OPENWINHOME environment variable (to
/usr/openwin, I guess)?  Seems that your Makefile includes directories
to search that do not contain the /usr/openwin prefix.  For example,

  Mick> mv Makefile Makefile.bak
  Mick> imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config
  Mick> makedepend -s "# DO NOT DELETE" -- -I. -I/libs -I/include
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^

This should probably be "-I/usr/openwin/include".

Hi:  

  I am new to this mail-list and new to FVWM in that matter.  I
currently work on a project which use FVWM2 (version 2.0.45) as window
manager.  I had problem with losing Focus on one window when the system
first started. 
   The system Setup 2 desks, one for Main Dispaly and another for
Configuration. The system may not ship with mouse, so we use
ClickToFouse in fvwm configuration file.  The problem is every time
after a Popup window goes away, so is the focus. I have to use mouse to
click in the window to get it back (or switch between desks which use
build-in FOCUS command).  Once I clicked the mouse every thing works
fine after that until you shut down FVWM and re-started.
(I tried to use MouseFocus which did not have this problem.)

Here is part of my .fvwm2rc file

You can start xwindows without a mouse?  All the x servers I've worked with
die the horrible bit-bucket death when you try to start them without a
mouse.  "Unable to open root deviceBUS ERROR" sorts of things.

Curioser and curiouser.

Date: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 11:03:52 -0800 (PST)


Is there any way to force a window to start on the same desktop as it's
parent?

I start an application with -xrm '*Desk:6', and I would like all windows
created by this application to start on that same desktop.

I can use StartsOnDesk to force all windows of that application to
start on a certain desktop, but I run the same application on multiple
desktops.


Thanks,
jim

A little further down the track ...

I did just as you suggested - I had missed the step run "xmkmf;make Makefiles"
and just ran ./MakeMakefiles instead. OOPs !

But now the install fails 'cause it can't find add_window.c.

Should this be part of the tar file or already on my machine ?

Ta,

Mick.

Sorry to bother you folks again; I'm still wrestling with xterm ...
Some clues which might strike a chord in someone are:

The xterm launched from Xsession by the lines
  /usr/bin/X11/fvwm &
  exec /usr/openwin/bin/xterm -T Xsession -n Xsession -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls

works fine (though I don't see how /dev/tty would be available to Xsession)
but the xterms attempted from system.fvwmrc in Function "InitFunction"
by the lines
   Exec  "I"   xterm -n fvwmrc-1 -T fvwmrc-1 -geometry 80x24+0+0 &
   Wait  "I"   xterm
   Desk  "I"   0 2
   Exec  "I"   xterm -n fvwmrc-2 -T fvwmrc-2 -geometry +0-0 &
   Wait  "I"   xterm
   Desk  "I"   0 0

( I tried with "exec xterm" and just "xterm" - same thing )
don't work any better than those from Popup "Utilities" by
   Exec    "Xterm"      exec /usr/openwin/bin/xterm &

However all other X apps work ;-( including Sun's cmdtool ), and xterm
works from all other Window managers, as well as from the command line
e.g. from the Xsession xterm above.  Has anybody any ideas what's
not available from system.fvwmrc that xterm needs ?  Or is there
some obscure xterm option or resource which I should be using ?

Thanks in advance,  Peter Billam

I've been strugglin with fvwm2 for some time now and can't seem to get
it to load.  I have my .xinitrc file set up to call fvwm2 &, but when I
run startx, I don't have a wm.  At this point, I can try and manually
execute fvwm2, doing so, I get the following:

../icons/*.xpm sed: can't read ../icons/*.xpm No such file or directory
xpmtoppm: EOF / read error
ppmtogif: EOF / read error reading magic number
/usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2: giftoppm: command not found
Performing quanitzation on 32 colors
usage: ppmquantall <new colors> <ppm file> <ppm file>...
Converting to xpm format again
*.ppm ppmtoxpm: *.ppm No such file or directory
Trying to fix transparent pixels in some files

Still no wm after this, although I do have an empty file called "*.xpm"
in my current dir.
Are these error messages part of the problem fvwm2 has starting, or
should they not be preventing its execution? 

Any help would be appreciated.

I  think the file /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2 is  some kind of shell that has
been  set  up  to  run   "quantize_pixmaps" from   the  fvwm2  "utils"
directory.

"quantize_pixmaps" is the  only  part of  the fvwm2 distribution  that
could generate these messsages.

I suggest that you look in  this shell to  find out where fvwm2 really
is and execute fvwm2 using its full path instead of this shell.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm2 bug?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hello World,

I have a fairly complex setup where I have some common files shared among
several machines and some machine-specific files.  I seem to be having a
little trouble getting Style to work right in this environment.

In my ~/.fvwm2rc file, I have (among a lot of other things) the line

  FvwmM4 -m4-prefix .fvwm2rc-machine

.fvwm2rc-machine is

  m4_define(`machine_fvwm2rc', `m4_esyscmd(echo "/home/norm/.$SHORTNAME/.fvwm2rc")')
  Read machine_fvwm2rc

The practical upshot of this is that fvwm2 encounters

  Read /home/norm/.hermes/.fvwm2rc

in the file processed by FvwmM4 (on my laptop, anyway).  In
/home/norm/.hermes/.fvwm2rc I have:

  # This is the fragment of the .fvwm2rc file specific to the host 
  # hermes.berkshire.net
  #

  HilightColor black palevioletred
  MenuStyle maroon black grey40 -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-* fvwm

  Style "xapm"   NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip
  Style "xapm"   BorderWidth 0, CirculateSkip, ClickToFocus
  Style "xapm"   Color black/#aa80aa

What is interesting is that MenuStyle _works_ but the Style attributes
for xapm are ignored.  If I copy these lines back into my top-level
.fvwm2rc file, they work fine.

Have I described the problem sufficiently?  Is this a bug or a feature? ;-)

    None. It *used* to make a difference in version 1, where you had to
specify exec if you wanted it prepended to the command. This is version
2 syntax, however, and version 2 *always* tacks the exec on, if you
didn't specify it. Really, it does.

>Which one is recommended ?

    I'd opt for the former: it makes the fvwmrc syntax look a lot less
cluttered. By the way, it doesn't matter whether you say

           Exec xterm -T Local &

or 

           exec xterm -T Local &

other than stylistically. The "Exec" here is an FVWM builtin command, 
and really ought to be capitalized for readability, but FVWM will
understand either way.

    I've not been following this list too regularly lately, so I've just
noticed this "to exec, or not to exec" thread. Sorry for not piping up
sooner.

here is my problem, right out of the FAQ:

33) I'm compiling under SunOS/Solaris with gcc, but it's complaining
    that "Language 'F' is unknown".  What's the problem?

and here is the FAQ answer:

A: Your Imake setup is not right for using gcc.  It's trying to use
   some flags for the native compilers that gcc interprets
   differently.  Get your system admin to "fix" your setup for use
   with gcc, or try using the FvwmCompiler and FvwmCompilerFlags
   defines in the Fvwm.tmpl file to get it to work for you.

i tried FvwmCompiler and FvwmCompilerFlags and that didn't fix anything.
i can't exactly ask my sysadmin to "fix" the problem since this is my
personal SPARCstation 5 at home.  i'm the sysadmin there, and i'll be 
damned if i know how to fix it.  i looked through the mailing list archives
and didn't find anything that helped me.  if there is a web page that someone
has with the solution that would be great.  if not, i'll put the instructions
for getting it to work on Solaris on my web page (with the how to get Doug
Jones' PDP-8 emulator working under Solaris) and you can point the FAQ or the
FVWM home page to there.

thanks for the help...

oh, i'm a long time FVWM 1.x user (linux) and am curious what major changes
i'll have to make to my lifestyle to start using 2.x

thanks again,

I think you have to twiddle the DefaultCCOptions "#define" in sun.cf
or somesuch file in /usr/openwin/lib/X11/config.  A good value seems
to be "-DSYSV -DSVR4".

to solve the imake problem I just insert the following lines to the imake file
I'm using:


#define USE_GCC
 
#ifdef USE_GCC
CC = gcc
CCOPTIONS = -Wall
CDEBUGFLAGS = -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
#endif


----------
just put the above at the beginning of the imake file and continue as normal.
I never really bothered with trying to get my systems admin to change the 
system settings

hope this helps
Graeme

Sorry, my process table disagrees. Running 2.0.45, any command of the form:

Exec sub-command

versus

Exec exec sub-command

leaves a shell process wrapping sub-command, waiting to it to terminate. By
changing all my "Exec" instances to "Exec exec", I get an immediate savings
of 7 processes when I first login, before I really start to run applications.

hmm, your solution gave me an idea, sun.cf has an #ifdef section for HasGcc,
i tried putting #define HasGcc YES in several of FVWM's files, but nothing
seems to get through to sun.cf to tell it what to do.  my original solution
(it works, but is a pain) is to manually got through sun.cf and yank out
any non-gcc #define's.  works, but a pain.  anybody have an idea where i could
either define HasGcc or define it as YES and get it to sun.cf??  it really
doesn't matter since we don't have SUN's cc here at work or at my house (thank
the GODs) so mashing sun.cf into line is no problem, i'm just trying to work
on a general solution so we can get some better help into the FAQ for all 
future solaris/fvwm users.

You're both right.  There are four possibilities:

  1) Exec xterm
  2) Exec exec xterm
  3) Exec xterm &
  4) Exec exec xterm &

1 creates two processes, 2 creates one process.  3 creates two
processes, but the shell immediately exits (because of the "&").  I
don't know about 4.

Seems like 2 is the best, except for complex situations, where one
would prefer 3, I guess.

Any opinions, anybody?

I take it you're still using 2.0.42?  This (mis)feature was expunged
in 2.0.43.  Here's the relevant info from the ChangeLog:

2.0.43
       [...]
       16. Removed implicit Exec exec stuff for the time being, until I
           come up with a better way to do it (back to old behavior)
       [...]

2.0.42
       [...]
       9. Made Exec use $SHELL, like mwm, if ExecUseSHELL is specified,
          plus Exec now does an explicit "exec" as the first arg (if it's
          not there already), to eliminate extra processes
       [...]

Just the opinion I've had since this topic first came up: there should be a
different keyword-- call it ExecNoShell for arguments' sake-- that uses fork 
and execve instead of system() to spawn the process. Then, if you need/want the
shell level (for the sake of variable evaluation perhaps) you can use Exec.

Unfortunately, imake parses these config files prior to
the fvwm Imakefile and template, so this won't help you
(as you've witnessed ;-).

I would recommend putting "#define HasGcc YES" in site.def.
This file is read both before and after a specific <vendor>.cf,
so you'll want it to put it within the "BeforeVendorCF" ifdef.

The MIT/XC man page for imake shows a good rundown on the order
that it parses templates and rule files.  The whole Imake process
can be a little intimidating at first, especially with limited
documentation on some platforms, but it can be great tool with
it's own share of strengths.

Best of luck.

Below is a fragment of a .fvwmrc file which works fine on SunOS/Solaris
fvwm 1.24r.  But when run it on Linux fvwm 1.24r, I get an error.
It's the backquotes that is the problem. Maybe someone knows the problem
or can offer a solution?

<---- fragment of .fvwmrc ----->
# Personal items

EndPopup
<------------------------------>

On debian linux this results in the message
    "NONE:0: m4: ERROR: EOF in string"
and then a fvwm segmentation fault.

Is there a problem with linux fvwm and what is being passed to m4, or does
the problem lie solely with linux's gnu m4? 

Thanks for any pointers.

Every time I go to download the latest FVWM-2 beta, I look at the
monster size and say "nah...  I'll do it later."  As a result, I'm
still all the way back at 2.0.43 (prehistoric, when it comes to
development...).
</gripe>

<proposal>
Patches (preferably unified diffs) should be available for downloading.

<apology>
Does someone already maintain an archive of these patches?  If so, it
would be really nice if they were merged with the main site...
</apology>

<obligatory offer :) >
If no one at all is willing to do this, then I'll do it myself for the
benefit of everyone else...  Though it'll certainly waste bandwidth,
since I'll have to download each new release and upload each patch (and
28.8 is molasses); and it certainly won't help my problem :)

Thanks to everyone who was so quick to respond to my problem. 
It turns out that Debian Linux fvwm was compiled to use m4 by default, and
so the quotes were causing problems when m4 was called.  

Calling fvwm with -no-m4 solved the problem.  Alternatively, it's been
pointed out that I can redefine how m4 quotes literals and this is even
mentioned in the man page (now that I know what the problem is).

Thanks again to all.

Steve

If you don't want to slow down your evening surfing, use the magic of UNIX:

echo "ncftp ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.0.45.tar.gz" | at 5:00am

CL> Patches (preferably unified diffs) should be available for downloading.

If somebody gives me patches, I'll put them up.  If anyone says that I can
trust cvs import and cvs diff to give good patches, I'll whip them out
right away.  I don't know how it reacts to moved or deleted files, though.

    This is what makes the Unix world so much fun, don't you think? On my 
Linux (2.0.27) system, I get no such thing. Kai Grossjohann quite reasonably
suggested that it depends on whether you end your command string with an 
ampersand, but I think it depends a lot more on which flavor of Unix and which
command shell you're using - and the complexity of the sub-command string, of 
course.

    Bummer. Actually, I've been using 2.0.45 since it came out, but I had 
overlooked that note in the ChangeLog. Maybe that'll teach me to read mailing 
lists at 2:00 a.m. But probably not. 

    Hmmm...was there any other problem with the (mis)feature than a tendency to
trip over leading blanks and try to Exec  exec  exec....? If not, then this 
little patch should fix it up.

Hmm ...  in .xsession-errors it says ...
   fvwm: error in config: PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/
    in line PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/

but in /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc it says ...
   # ModulePath is a colon-separated list, just like regular unix PATH
   ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/
   PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/
   IconPath   /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/

which looks pretty reasonable, surely ?  And yet in .xsession-errors it
also says ...
   Fvwm: No such module /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/ FvwmBanner

where the spurious space looks suspicious, but there's _no_ space at
the end of the ModulePath line above, and system.fvwmrc also says
   Function "InitFunction"
	Module  "I"     FvwmBanner

where there's _no_ spurious space before FvwmBanner, just one tab.  I
must be doing something wrong, I hope it's not too embarrasing ...

Hi,

I'm using Pure Atria's "Purify" software on a Solaris 2.5.1 box. My
main workstation, though, is a DEC Alpha running Digital Unix 4.0b
where I use FVWM 2.0.44 as the window manager. 

While this works quite nice, I stumbled accross a weird problem
yesterday: When running the Purify viewer on Solaris and displaying
it on the DEC Alpha running FVWM, the viewer window does *not* get
its window decorations (border, menu button in the upper left corner,
min,max buttons in the upper right corner) drawn so I cannot resize
or move the window.

This does *not* happen with mwm and dtwm on the DEC alpha.

Can anyone give me a clut about how to fix this? *All* of my windows
get their decorations properly. The Purify viewer is the only exception.

Thanks -- Tom

Hi,
	The generic Style (*) is overridden by specific styles for windows.	
e.g. if I have a style called (*lock) all my windows like xlock, oclock will 
follow this style and other windows that don't have a specific style assigned to 
them will follow the (*) style. So, check up if you have a special style for the 
purify window type.
	
	
regards,	
sumeet

HI,
	Has anyone run fvwm 2.0.45 or 2.0.44 on a SunOS  5.5.1 or 5.5.x ?
I am facing *dire* problems with versions 2.0.45 and 2.0.40 on my Sun Ultra 
running SunOS 5.5.1. I have gone throught the manpages (RTFM :)) several times
and am convinced that my syntax is correct and also that I am not making any
silly mistakes. Still FvwmButtons is giving me a lot of problems.
	I am also not able to get the damned thing compiled on my machine. Get 
all sorts of errors doing "make Makefiles". If anyone has faced these problems 
before, can you give me some tips please ?
	
	
thanks,
sumeet

I've already checked that but this is not the reason. The Purify window's
title is "Purify: xxxx" where "xxxx" is the exe I'm debugging. I did not
find any style in my .fvwm2rc file which matches that.

Maybe Purify uses some weird internal name which causes the fvwm style
mechanism to fail and not to match *any* of its styles including the "*"
style? Could this be the reason?

Use the FvwmIdentify module to see not only the window name but also
the resource name and class.  Fvwm matches all of those.

Just tried it. It gives:

          Name:            Purify: xxxxx
          Icon Name:       Purify: xxxxx
          Class:           Purify
          Resource:        purify
          Window ID:       0x800001f
          Desk:            1
          Width:           519
          Heigth:          441
          BoundaryWidth:   0
          Sticky:          No
          OnTop:           No
          NoTitle:         Yes
          Iconified:       No
          Gravity:         NorthWest
          Geometry:        149x280+621+0

I think the suspicious entries are "BoundaryWidth" and "NoTitle".

I've just tried to override that in the .fvwm2rc file with:

          Style "Purify*"  BorderWidth 8, Title, Handles, StartsOnDesk2

The "StartsOnDesk 2" works, but I still got no window decorations.

Any ideas?

Thanks -- Tom

Hi Tom,
	Can you try the foll. ?
	
	Style "Purify*" UseStyle "*"
	
	Theoretically this should work - but I ain't confident at all, because I 
have faced many problems with fvem2.0.45

No. This does not work either. Apparently the Purify window explicitly 
turns off its decorations or something.

Any more ideas anyone?

There is stuff about MWM specific settings in Fvwm.  Try those?

I've already turned on almost all MWM lookalike settings in fvwm
but I'll check them out again.

Hi everybody,

I've solved it:

This was the problem. I had the following setting:

Style "*" MWMDecor

because I thought it would make Fvwm more compatible to MWM which does
not seem to be the case. After commenting it out, Purify comes up with a
standard window decoration as well.

Thanks to Kai Grossjohann <grossjohann@charly.cs.uni-dortmund.de> and
          sumeet singh <sumeet@iss.nus.sg>

for their help.

The problem for me was mostly that I use ;s in a couple of commands.
exec causes the second command to get lost.  Obviously I could run sh
-c "command1 ; command2", and frankly that would have been OK by me,
though it would have been nice if I'd been warned someplace other than
the ChangeLog (I don't even recall any discussion about it before the
2.0.42 release).  A better solution, IMO, would be to have two
Exec's, one that uses the shell, one that directly forks and exec's
the given command.

  inconvenience. ]

Hello World,

I have a fairly complex setup where I have some common files shared among
several machines and some machine-specific files.  I seem to be having a
little trouble getting Style to work right in this environment.

In my ~/.fvwm2rc file, I have (among a lot of other things) the line

  FvwmM4 -m4-prefix .fvwm2rc-machine

.fvwm2rc-machine is

  m4_define(`machine_fvwm2rc', `m4_esyscmd(echo "/home/norm/.$SHORTNAME/.fvwm2rc")')
  Read machine_fvwm2rc

The practical upshot of this is that fvwm2 encounters

  Read /home/norm/.hermes/.fvwm2rc

in the file processed by FvwmM4 (on my laptop, anyway).  In
/home/norm/.hermes/.fvwm2rc I have:

  # This is the fragment of the .fvwm2rc file specific to the host 
  # hermes.berkshire.net
  #

  HilightColor black palevioletred
  MenuStyle maroon black grey40 -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-* fvwm

  Style "xapm"   NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip
  Style "xapm"   BorderWidth 0, CirculateSkip, ClickToFocus
  Style "xapm"   Color black/#aa80aa

What is interesting is that MenuStyle _works_ but the Style attributes
for xapm are ignored.  If I copy these lines back into my top-level
.fvwm2rc file, they work fine.

Have I described the problem sufficiently?  Is this a bug or a feature? ;-)

Hello Fvwm Mailing List,

	I've always used Fvwm '95's TaskBar with Fvwm 2.0.x.  I would like to
take advantage of a new feature in Fvwm '95's v2.0.43a's TaskBar which
is that it lets you configure it so only the windows on the current
desktop show up on the TaskBar.  So I would like to use this new TaskBar
with FVWM (the version of FVWM I am using now v2.0.45).  However, there
seems to be a problem with it.

	The icons don't show up in the TaskBar.  The TaskBar from v2.0.42
worked fine.  Anybody know what is going on here?

	Thanks in advance for any help on this!

    So, it seems we really need 3 options to satisfy everybody...

    1) ExecClassic  -- the original, as Exec reverted to in 2.0.43: no 
       implicit exec added, if you want it, you add it. This must 
       be used to handle things like
         Exec  xterm -e my-first-thing ; my-second-1 ; my-third 
       I suppose Exec should continue to use this form, for backward 
       compatibility...?
    2) ExecLite  -- as Exec was in 2.0.42: always using exec
    3) ExecQuick -- (UltraLite?) no shell, just use an exec call directly.

    I suppose Exec should continue to use the Classic form, for backward 
compatibility (though I really preferred the ExecLite version)? Unless 
somebody wants to see yet another command, something like

                ExecDefaultsTo [Classic | Lite | Quick]

    Since I opened my big mouth and reawakened a discussion that had just about
died of old age and natural causes, I'll volunteer to work up a patch to 
implement this. First, though, I'd like to hear your suggestions on the 
following  - a consensus among users would be really nice.

    1) As an alternative to having 3 separate commands, we could try ultra 
       clever parsing of the command string to try to decide which style is best
       for it. I'd shy away from that, because a) 3 distinct commands give 
       greater flexibility to the power user who wants precise control, and 
       b) one of these days someone's going to come up with an environment 
       customized to use some other delimiter than a semicolon, and I don't want
       to be around when it happens. Opinions? 

    2) Which do you think should be the default behavior for the existing Exec 
       command? No, I don't want to use #3 as the default.

    3) What would you like to see the commands called? Actually, I don't mind 
       using the whimsical names above, but some people might like to see 
       something a little more, uh, professional.

                To exec, or not to exec, that is the question -
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                The slings and arrows of outrageous forking,
                Or to take arms against a sea of shell procs,
                And by exec-ing, end them?...

                For...who would flame wars bear,
                To grunt and sweat under a weary shell,
                But that the fear of something after fork -
                That undiscovered country from whose Bourne
                No traveller returns - puzzles the will,
                And makes us rather bear those procs we have
                Than spawn yet others that we know not of.
                Thus conscience does make cowards of us all....

[I am not on the list; please keep me in the CC]

I have just made the transition from the ancient fvwm-1.24 to fvwm2.
After an hour of RTFM-ing, I've successfully (re)created a .fvwm2rc
file, and I am quite satisfied with the whole experience.  fvwm2 is
great.

To the problem at hand: in fvwm-1 when I moved the windows, the pager
(I'm not sure if it was the builtin or the external pager) used to
reflect the window movements *while I was doing them*.  fvwm2 doesn't
seem to do so.

For example, in fvwm1 I would move a window around by its title bar,
and watched interactively the placement of its small mirror image in
the pager, which would help me decide where to put it.  In fvwm2 the
pager is updated only after I release the window.

Is this a bug, or a slight design deficiency between the fvwm core and
FvwmPager module?  Is it possible to retain the old fvwm1 behaviour in
that respect?

	Why not just make the second parameter to the Exec call one of the 
three options? For example:

+ Exec [Classic] command1

It would make it real easy to see what version of it one is using.

While we're at it, let's make the second parameter "exec" if we want
ExecLite, and just use ExecClassic as the default for exec.  So:

Exec xterm

is ExecClassic, and

Exec exec xterm

is ExecLite.  Wait a minute!  It already does this!  How quaint.

My point is, we don't really need FVWM to fool around with the shell
command string, by addings "exec"'s and such.  It's just asking for
trouble.  However, I would support a new command ("Execv" sounds good)
that would be Bob's ExecQuick - just fork and exec directly, doing no
parsing of the command line other than to split args on whitespace.

I've been playing with the window manager and the possibility of
changing the look of the manager.  Now, I've noticed in the FvwmWindow
structure defined in fvwm.h that there is a member variable called
'bw'.  What is this variable used for and how does it work with the
'border_width' and 'handle_width' variables?

Thanks,
G.

What are the chances that I'll get both variable names wrong?  The
variables I am asking about are 'boundary_width' and 'corner_width', not
'border_width' and 'handle_width'

Thanks,

Hello Fvwm Mailing List!,

	Sometimes, certain dialog boxes in Netscape (such as the Open Location
dialog, or Save As dialog) would only pop up with just the title bar
showing (as if the WindowShade function was in effect).  I've noticed
this phenomenon with other FVWM derived WM's as well (i.e. AfterStep and
Fvwm '95).  Since I now use FVWM 2.0.x., I figured I might as well post
about it here.

	I'm almost certain that this is a Motif related occurance, but since
I've only noticed this so far with Netscape (probably because the Motif
app I use the most is Netscape), I thought it would be better to post
this as a "Netscape problem" rather than a more general "Motif problem".

	Anybody have any ideas as to what could be the problem?  And if so, a
fix to this problem?  Thanks!

Some time in the last year, Henrique Martins posted a patch that
"fixed" this.  Here's some URLs on the subject in the mailing list
archive:

<URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9602/msg00262.html>

That was the first posting (as far as I can tell) of that patch.  I
don't know if there were any updates.

<URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9604/msg00089.html>

That one is a jumbo patch to 2.0.42 that includes the window move
patch, but you probably don't want the whole thing since some of the
features were included in later releases in different ways.  However,
if there were any changes to the patch in question, this is, I think,
the latest instance of it.

<URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9604/msg00094.html>
<URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9604/msg00102.html>

The last two describe a problem that I also experienced.  It appears
to be a bad interaction with the openwin server since other X servers
seem to work OK according to other messages in the thread.

Also, note that the patch in question was designed for 2.0.42.  I have
no idea if it'll patch cleanly to 2.0.45.

hth,

OK, so I'm curious.  Probably inherited it from my cats.  I did a
further search and I am pretty sure this is the last word on the
moving windows patch in the list archive:

<URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9611/msg00169.html>

It took a bit of work to patch into 2.0.45.  fvwm/modules.h and
fvwm/move.c needed to be done partly by hand.  It still doesn't work
for me on Solaris 2.5 with the openwin server (same problem as before:
the pager goes through the moves after mouse release).  If you don't
use openwin, you may be OK with it though.  I hesitate to post the
stuff I had to do by hand as a patch because my tree is already
heavily patched and I'm not sure what other cruft would end up in
there.

I can't get the above to work from a menu. I have dtaction on my path but I
get the error message:

/usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession: Command not found.


>  3) For some reason it takes about 1 minute to log in. Something is timing out.

many of us out there are forced to use CDE and so it's best if we can use some 
of its facilities without having to use dtwm.
thanks for any help you can give

Thanks for your help, David.  However, note that I run the binary fvwm
release from the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.  I am loathe to patch
fvwm by hand if that patch will never get into distribution -- somehow
it looks like (almost) wasted work, because as new releases will come,
I'll have to do the job over again.

What is the fvwm maintainer's position on this patch?  Why isn't it in
the baseline fvwm2?


P.S.
As in all lousy bug reports, I haven't mentioned my fvwm version.
It's 2.0.45, as you guessed.  I use it on Debian GNU/Linux with
XFree86 server.

This looks like the exec is looking for "dtaction ExitSession" i.e. not seeing
the space between dtaction and ExitSession.  Have you got a TAB in there instead 
of a space?

Hope this helps.

Good lord, if I had known my complaints would have spawned this sort of
debate, I'd have kept quiet once I was shown the "Exec exec" syntax.

This message best mirrors my own feelings. First off, we should do absolutely
*nothing* to Exec. To alter it would threaten the existing rc files of the 
entire fvwm2 user base.

All I had suggested was a faster, lighter Execv keyword. I had no intention of
leading this topic into a triple of new keywords, new syntax, etc. Anymore, I
would be content if the docs just pointed out Exec exec as the solution to
avoiding the intermediate shell.

Well, I'm not sure I care one way or the other about it - it just
wasn't high on my list of priorities and I forgot about looking into
it.  I'll have to think about it for the next release, but I don't
make any guarantees about actually adding it.

Well, I just converted console.pl from the extras/fvwmperl directory to the
new syntax in, oh, about 40 minutes. :-) A tip of the hat to the original
author (not named in the source code, but if he or she self-identifies, I shall
acknowledge in my source code) who wrote handlers and Tk code that needed very
little touch-up (a few typos here and there that perl's "use strict" helped me
find).

I plan on fleshing it out more, mainly because the newer capabilities of Perl
allow so. But I officially have more than one useful sample script in my
distribution :-).

Hi folks,

I've been having some problems with my fvwm2rc file, mainly that I've
read the man, followed the syntax properly, and stuff still isn't
happening the way it's supposed to, and I'm hoping someone can tell me
why.  (I know I've probably done something stupid, but I'd still be
grateful if someone could point it out to me).

Problem 1:  I'm trying to set up my window buttons, and I have 4 entries
like this:

ButtonStyle 6 Vector 17 ...(correct # coordinates & stuff)
ButtonStyle 4 11 ...(coords, etc.)

The problem is I don't get anything drawn on my buttons, and an error is
reported:  [FVWM][ReadButtonFace]:<<ERROR>> unknown style Vector: Vector
17 ...

or it says unknown style 11...

Also, if I use AddButtonStyle instead of ButtonStyle, it complains that
it can't find the module AddButtonStyle in the module path, as if it
didn't recognize the command.  It also fails to recognize the command
BorderStyle, complaining again that it can't find the module.

I'm using version 2.0.45, as reported by fvwm2 -version

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kenn Brodhagen

 Hi,
 	I am not going to provide any solution to your problem. I am
 only posting this mail to report similar problems.
 
 Firstly, I am running fvwm2.x on a Sun Ultra, SunOS 5.5.1 - which is
 your machine ?
 	Secondly, in my case too, fvwm does not recognize the commands
 BorderStyle and TitleStyle. But this only happens when i attempt a
 restart. If I quit from fvwm and start it again, it is able to recognize
 BorderStyle and TitleStyle.
 	Lastly, my FvwmButtons 2.0.45 is totally
 goofed up. It never shows a button bar. So I am forced to run FvwmButtons
 2.0.40 with fvwm2.0.45. Unfortunately, FvwmButtons 2.0.40 does not
 recognize the new syntax (with the parentheses around it) and the
 load of options that comes with it. Hence I am using an old fashioned
 button bar with very few customizable featuers.
 
 
 cheers,
 sumeet

Are there at the moment any plans to re-unite the diverging lines
between fvwm2 and fvwm95. 
As far as I (as a layperson) can tell, the differences are 
fairly superficial, such as the ability to have a 'side-bar'
in your menus and the fact that the menu is places next to the 
previous menu while cascading, instead of half of top of it.
Is there a way to simulate this behaviour in fvwm2, are or the 
differences more substantial?

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I am using Linux 2.0.29, with X11R6 (of course). I am having trouble
installing FVWM 2.0.45 (and have had the same results with 2.0.43). I
get an error (warning) during compile, that basically indicate that a
pointer type is dropped during passing of an argument from two functions
in "read.c" (called by fvwm.c). The two functions are "ReadFile" and
"PipeRead". These are causing me problems after installation, such that,
for some reason (probably due to the compile warnings), fvwm can't load
modules (at startup). Anyone had this problem?

Please HELP!!!

Thanks,
Joe (joez@gslink.com)

Hi everybody,
	I am faceing a problem similar to what Thomas Leitner reported
a few days back - a window doesn't get the sides, frame and title from
fvwm2. It comes up all right in mwm.
	This is what FvwmIdentify returns about the window:

	Name:		Call for Meeting
	Icon Name:	Call for Meeting
	Class:		VendorShell
	Resource:	dialog
	Window ID:	0x3000d8
	Desk:		1
	Width:		490
	Height:		370
	BoundaryWidth:	0
	Sticky:		No
	Ontop:		No
	NoTitle:	Yes
	Iconified:	No
	Gravity:	NorthWest
	Geometry:	490x370+255+249

	And this is what xwininfo returns:

  Absolute upper-left X:  256
  Absolute upper-left Y:  250
  Relative upper-left X:  0
  Relative upper-left Y:  0
  Width: 490
  Height: 370
  Depth: 8
  Visual Class: PseudoColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOutput
  Colormap: 0x21 (installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: no
  Map State: IsViewable
  Override Redirect State: no
  Corners:  +256+250  -406+250  -406-280  +256-280
  -geometry 490x370+255+249


	Unfortunately the solution that Thomas Leitner proposed doesn't
work here (i.e. turning off MWMDecor ).
	anyone knows what the problem is ?

thanks,
sumeet

Hi chuck,
	Thank you very much for your help. It works now. However, let
me take this opportunity (since you are the maintainer of the code) to
point out that the options DecorateTransient/NakedTransient, 
DumpPlacement and ActivePlacement are just mentioned in the list of
Style options. There is no explanation of their actions in the manual
page. Maybe there are more such options that have been left out in
the man pages.
	
	Secondly, how do I change the active and inactive colors (solid)
of the border ? I can only find TiledPixmap in BorderStyle but nothing
with which I can specify a solid fill.


thanks a million,
sumeet

In .fvwm2rc,

"MenuStyle big.long.hardtotype.font.name fvwm" gives the half-
overlapping menu style.  Replace 'fvwm' with 'mwm' and you'll
get the next-to/immediate popup behavior of fvwm95.

I found this one by accident, after borrowing a few pieces from
the DecorCD setup mentioned here earlier.

Hi

I've just installed the latest version of fvwm2 on my Linux 2.0.21 box, and I'm
having problems with FvwmButtons. It doesn't seem to work at all, and produces
a core dump every time I try to invoke FvwmButtons. Is this a known problem, or
have I just screwed up?

I also get an error message on the console window every time I startup fvwm2.
The message is:

  X Error of failed request: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window Parameter)
    Major opcode of failed request: 62 (X_CopyArea)
    Resource id in failed request: 0x2000068
    Serial number of failed request: 9675
    Current serial number in output stream: 9682

Some details of my system in case it helps: it's an IBM 486 with Linux 2.0.21
and Xfree86 3.1.2 installed. I compiled fvwm2 using gcc 2.7.2

Hope somebody can help. Thanks

where is the read function defined?

I found the function that reads the fvwmrc file in read.c but I can't find
the function that allows individual files to be read during normal operation.

I'm trying to hack a little bit of code and introduce a new envirmonet variable
FVWMHOME so that I can store all my fvwm file in a single directory such as
CDE does. if anyone has already done this could they let me know.

thanks
Graeme

In functions.c:

  {"Read",         ReadFile,         F_READ,                FUNC_NO_WINDOW},

Looks to me like ReadFile is used for .fvwm2rc and the "read" command,
and piperead.

If  you look  at ReadSubFunc (read.c),  it looks  like if the filename
doesn't start with a slash, it tries $HOME, and if that fails it tries
FVWMDIR.

I believe you get some environment variable expansion if you use M4 or
cpp.  But some builtin expansion would be nice.

on this subject: is there a nice string function that will strip a variable
from a path name and replace it with the value of that variable.

e.g

$HOME/bin  with /home/orion/mccaffer/bin

I'm trying to give fvwm the ability to expand variables when reading files.

Hi,

I've got my FvwmButtons set up so that it swallows xbiff in one
button.  I'd like to have something happen when I hit a button in the
xbiff, so I used the following config line:

,-----
| # continuation line for easier reading only                       
| *FvwmButtons(1x1, Action "Exec exec xfrom", \                     
|              Swallow XBiff "Exec exec xbiff -geometry =48x48+0+0")
`-----

But, alas, it doesn't work: a mouse click is passed on to the xbiff.

I would also be happy if you told me of a program that can produce a
list of messages when you click on it.  I know of xmultibiff, but it
only shows the number of messages, no nice icon like xbiff does.

Also, if you had an xbiff that could ignore certain mails (such as
those from the Debian mailing list) I'd be very glad.

Hi,

how do I tell Fvwm that icons should be placed in the lower right hand
corner of the screen, from right to left (and bottom to top)?

All IconBox statements that I tried placed the icons left to right
rather than right to left.

tia,
kai

The easiest way to ignore messages is to filter mail on receipt
(using, e.g., procmail).

A biff that handles multiple mailboxes, produces lists of
messages, has nice icons, etc., is included with tkgoodstuff.

	Strangely, it looks like Linux users face no such problems.
Can anyone throw some light please ?

Dear Sumeet,

may I point out the second sentence I wrote above?  I know about
IconBox, and I successfully wrote IconBox statements to place the
icons I wanted in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  I use
"IconBox 0 -10 -280 -1".

But I *still* don't know how to put the icons right to left rather
than left to right.  :-(

(The obvious thing to try was to reverse the coordinates but that
didn't seem to do the right thing.)

Any help?

Well, the answer is RTFM.  The standard xbiff can do this :-)  There
is an X ressource "checkCommand" which I set to the following shell
script, and now xbiff is ignoring Debian mails :-)

,-----
| #!/bin/sh
| if ( from | egrep -v 'debian' >/dev/null 2>&1 )
| then
|     exit 0;
| else
|     exit 2;
| fi
`-----

Obviously it is very easy to customize.

I'd still like to have a list of messages, though, preferrably by
pressing the button that has swallowed xbiff.

for those looking for a biff that displays messages in mail box, try
xpbiff.

it's available from the usual places, though it can only check one mailbox at
a time.
if you don't want it to show mailing list stuff you filter that upon delivery.

on that note my system has PP (version 6.0) which has a mail filter.
could anyone who has a working mailfilter file please mail it to me as I need
a good working example of one.

Install "procmail" to automatically sort your mailinglists into a
different spool file. Then "xbiff" won't see the new messages that
arrive on the list.

I think installing xbiff *only* to ignore a few mails is overkill.  I
RTFM'd and found that the "checkCommand" ressource is grokked by
xbiff:

,----- from ~/.Xdefaults
| XBiff*checkCommand:     /home-local/grossjoh/bin/check-for-new-mail
| XBiff*onceOnly:         true
| XBiff*update:           5
`-----

,----- ~/bin/check-for-new-mail
| if ( from | egrep -v 'debian' >/dev/null 2>&1 )
| then
|     exit 0;
| else
|     exit 2;
| fi
`-----

This works dandy, and it's simple to add to the egrep, too.

I already use the nifty mail splitting functions from Gnus and I'm so
happy with them that I don't want anything else.

I like xbuffy, which can handle multiple mailboxes.  Look in

a few weeks ago, i asked about StartsOnPage and the only answers i got
were 'yes, please, implement it'.

well, here it is, hacked together in some 90 minutes.

*** WARNING: use at your own risk! ***

in fvwm/misc.h all the 32 bits of an int are already taken for the
values for name_list flags. i had to use one of the bits and chose the
one that is used by MINIICON_FLAG, and therefore my patch only works
when MINI_ICONS is disabled in Fvwm.tmpl. (the patch takes care of that.)

you'll find a short description of the StartsOnPage feature in both the
(unmodified) TO-DO file and in the (patched) manual.

best,
 rj

     I suppose that this is an obvious question, but I checked the FAQs and 
     didn't see that anyone had asked it before:
     
     Is fvwm year 2000 compliant?
     
     Thanks!

I *knew* somebody would ask this...  Well, in Unix time is measured in
seconds since Epoch (Jan 1, 1970, midnight).  32 bit integers will run
out in 2038 or so, so you ought to have bought a 64 bit machine by
then :-)

The year-2000 problem doesn't arise because there is no place where
times are stored as a two-digit year value.

Am I wrong?

Hi,
	Can anyone tell me the meaning of 'handles' ? I have no clue
as to what a handle is and how it is different from the border. Also
please explain the meanings of HandleWidth, BorderWidth and Frame.

	I have read the manuals.

thanks,
sumeet

A better word for handle would be "corner", I guess.  You see, when
you drag the edge of a window, you can resize it in one direction
(left/right or up/down).  When you drag the handle (or corner) of a
window, you can resize it in two directions (left/right and up/down).
The handle is that part of the border that is recognized as a corner.
You'll notice the mouse pointer shape changes in a handle as opposed
to the rest of the border.

I have the following lines in my .fvwmrc:

Mouse 1	FS	A	Resize-or-Raise

AddToFunc Resize-or-Raise	"I" Raise
+				"M" Resize
+				"D" Lower

Which describe the behaviour you want.

I'm about to attempt to use FVWM on an SGI.  I know SGI window managers
use several dot files to define ones session and layout characteristics,
but I'm a bit hazy on how to have my login on this machine use FVWM
rather than SGI's default window manager.

Any clues?

Thanks.

Question 35 of the SGI graphics FAQ says this (some long lines
wrapped):

================================================================
You must use a .xsession file and explicitly invoke the window manager
and any other applications you want to use, such as 'toolchest' and 'xwsh'. 

After making this change, you may only be able to log out by using the
"Log Out" selection in the toolchest, or by executing /usr/bin/X11/endsession. 

Here are the contents of a sample .xsession file:

xhost + & toolchest -name ToolChest > /dev/console 2&>1 & \
   winterm -bg red & winterm -bg blue & mwm >/dev/console 2&>1 & \
   /usr/bin/X11/reaper 

Note that 'reaper' is not put into the background. When 'reaper' exits
you will be logged out.

Alternatively, you can do the following steps:

1. cp /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession ~/.xsession

2. Remove the lines in ~/.xsession that say:

if [ -r $xsession -a "$0" != $xsession ]; then
  if [ -x $xsession ]; then exec $xsession else exec /bin/sh $xsession fi
fi 

3. Change the line that says

/usr/bin/X11/4Dwm >/dev/console 2>&1 & 

to 

/usr/bin/X11/mwm > /dev/console 2>&1 & 
================================================================

Just change mwm to fvwm2, etc., and note the part about having to
run endsession.

Create a .xinitrc shell script, executable permissions, something like:

#!/bin/sh 
#
# Try to save any errors we get
exec 1> ~user/.errs-xsess 2>&1
#
xrdb ~user/.Xdefaults
/usr/local/bin/fvwm2 1> ~/.fvwm-errs 2>&1


This should override all the 4Dwm setup stuff and call fvwm2 instead.  All
other setup is the same as on any other machine (e.g. .fvwm2 file).  Note
that if you're experimenting you'll want some way of getting to that .xinitrc
file without logging in on the console, since if that file is messed up you
may find yourself unable to fire up an X session at all until it's fixed.

First thing you want to do is create a .xinitrc which is simply a shell
script that run's fvwm ... Make sure to set variables like
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you compiled against shared libraries that aren't in
the usual places (usually libXpm4.8.so or something). Then, at the end of
the file, just "exec fvwm" or fvwm2, or whatever.

Then just create a file (empty or not, doesn't matter, as long as the file
exhists) that is call .disableDesktop ... This file lets IRIX know to
aviod running it's own desktop and to run the .xinitrc instead ... have a
ball.

Don't foget the .disableDesktop !!!! Without it, IRIX won't even see the
.xinitrc ... with .xsession, however, it will see it, but it'll let you
know that it is executing it. Now, as for getting to your .xinitrc if
something goes wrong, just press "F1" (the function key) after you type
your passwd to log in, instead of pressing Carraige Return... Its a safe
login that'll pop up a single (rather large) xterm for you.

Over here, the mouse pointer changes over the sides as well. :) So you
could say the border is a handle when it makes your mouse pointer look
different. I don't know what other differences there are with the normal
border, but with both you can resize the window. With handles you *know*
when you can click to resize (or do the other thing you defined).

More to the point, fvwm is 2K compliant because no *calculations* are done on
dates that may have been stored in abbreviated format (Year 2K worries are
really big in the tele-coms these days).

>From my brief look at the source, the only places I see time being noted are
timestamps on events and on packets sent to modules. All of these times are
being recorded and transmitted as raw values returned from the C library, so
there should be no Year 2K problems in fvwm.

Hi,
	Is there any function I can use,  to identify the current
desk number ? I want to be able to circulate through desks using a
keyboard shortcut, for which i need to change the desks in the foll.
order: 0-1-2-3-0.. I can use 'Desk' to increment the desk number, 
but then how do I make the transition from desk 3 to desk 0 ?



thanks,
sumeet

you're telling me!!!  we are having no end of trouble due to the yr2000
issue.  the OS that runs on the 3b2 (outdated version of SysV) breaks in
3 years.  we support two product, on runs on the sparc series amd the other
runs on the 3b2, guess what we have to re-write before 2000??  *sigh*

after deleting everything and choosing not to bother with fvwm i've changed
my mind and have descided to take the time to get it going.  so i figured
i'd start with libXpm so i get fancy neato color icons and stuff.  well,
it isn't going so well.  (big suprise)

making xpm-3.4g

root@blackhole> pwd
/user/xpm-3.4g
root@blackhole> xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config
root@blackhole> make Makefiles
making Makefiles in lib...
make[1]: Entering directory `/user/xpm-3.4g'

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `Makefiles'. Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/user/xpm-3.4g/lib'
{does the same for sxpm}

how do i tell it where imake really is?  how do i get it to use the correct
config directory? 

thanks,

It's a Solaris bug (it's been there at least since 2.3, which was the
first version of Solaris I ever used), and it'll bite you on any
program that uses imake and has subdirectories with Imakefiles
(ie. xpm, fvwm and so on). On line 674 of
/usr/openwin/lib/config/Project.tmpl [1], you'll see a line saying

IMAKE = $(IMAKESRC)/imake

- IMAKESRC is later defined as $(CONFIGSRC)/imake,
ie. /usr/openwln/lib/config/imake, which is wrong.

So the fix is to either make a symlink to imake in
/usr/openwin/lib/config or (probably better) change the above line to
say

IMAKE = $(BINDIR)/imake

(or something similar, that works)

Enjoy,
 Andrew

Footnotes: 
[1]  This may be slightly inaccurate, as I've changed jobs since I
worked all this out, and while we have a solaris box here, it's not
one I do any compiling on normally, so I'm just guessing from looking
at the file.  As such, make sure you backup Project.tmpl first !

 Hi,

 please don't blame me for the following:

 The Fvwm.tmpl allows to define -DMODALITY_IS_EVIL to totally disable
 motif applications ability to have modal dialogs.

 That's fine, but not the solution I think. From my point of view I
 expect a possibility to achieve correct handling of dialogs which
 might be either
 o XmDIALOG_SYSTEM_MODAL,
 o XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL,
 o XmDIALOG_FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL,
 o XmDIALOG_MODELESS or
 o XmDIALOG_WORK_AREA

 In practice using -DMODALITY_IS_EVIL makes live a little dangerous.
 Today, the 'default' fvwm2 seems to make no difference between
 FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL and APPLICATION_MODAL dialogs which is, I
 would say, to restrictive.
 
 Has anyone some remarks, hints or (best of all) a solution.

 Regards, Mic.

Hi

First accept my apologies for not having sat upon this list for the
customary time
before asking dumb questions!!
Excuse, I have spent quite some while going through the man pages at the
FVWM Home page and not found the answer I want.... told you , poor
excuse, real reason impatience to get it all working!!!

OK, so I have Caldera COL Base with the FVWM which comes with it.
Incidentaly, I cant figure out which version this is, as I had fvwm
1.x.x in a RedHat dist. and a fvwm2.x.x. in a Slackware, also played
with fvwm95, but this Caldera version requires me to relearn a load of
stuff.

I am also using (trying to use) Matt Barons Panel (like Goodstuff).

Problem:
I have Pager set to give 4 Desktops each with a 2x2 screen structure.
I can switch screen with mouse and accelerator keys and swith desktop
with mouse
How do I switch desktops from a command ( say within .panelrc ) so I can
set a button to do this, and how do I instruct an application to start
up on a particular destop?

To save time simply a pointer as to where to look for this info would be
enough

Thanks in advance

Phil Risby

There was a flame-fest a while back about modality.  There was almost consensus
that system-modality is evil.  Personally speaking, I don't want Fvwm
complicated with modality handling code.  If an application crashes because
it is relying on the window manager to enforce modality then the appplication
is defective IMHO.  There may be scope after 2.1 and the great style flag 
rewrite to build a module that manages modality (maybe a SmartFocus module
that would allow sloppy-focus to be controlled such that moving the mouse
to an application window would move the focus to the relevant dialog box etc.)

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

it probably also doesn't help that xmkmf is looking in /usr/lib/X11/config
instead of /usr/openwin/lib/config, if i manually invoke imake and tell it
to look in the right place it seems to work just fine.

stupid solaris.

I'm quite a newbe, by the way ... I am
experiencing some problems with FvwmAudio
module under Linux (Linux 2.0.0, fvwm95-2 is
2.0.41f).
	Everything seems working fine, but I really
can't hear no sound at all (and I'm not getting
deaf, I hope ... ;-).
	The Audio module is up, after fvwm95-2 has
started; if I "cat sing.au > /dev/audio" my old
good 8 bits soundblaster chirps happily; the
device I use in the module setup section is (as
You guessed) "/dev/audio"; the player I use is
"rplay" (but I also tryed the internal player,
with not more luck).

	Can anybody suggest what am I doing wrong ?
Which test could I play ? which sort of debug
could I try ? Any advise is obviously welcome.
Thank You all in advance for boring You. Best
regards from Italy (o) .

I recently upgraded the OS on my pentium 166 from RedHat Linux 3.0.3 to
4.1 and, at the same time upgraded from fvwm-2.0.43 to 2.0.45.
Everything seemed to install smoothly, but now the FvwmButtons module no
longer works. It comes up briefly, then disappears with no messages or
warnings of any kind.

Any clues for the clueless?

TIA...

Greets,

	I would like to hear an "official" stance (if there is one), on
proposed aesthetic features.  Things like pixmaps in modules/titlebars/bg's
gradient menus etc, etc...

	Obviously the modules changes are up to their respective
maintainers, but I would like to know if the fvwm2 developers plan to add
the things that, afterstep in particular, has implemented (the features
mentioned above).  I found it a little quirky that gradient titlebars were
implemented, but not gradient menu styles.  

	I've been unable to find any sort of unofficial patch archive
btw... is there such a thing?  I could be convinced to maintain such an
animal if there's sufficient need.  If one exists already, I'd appreciate
a pointer (searches of the archived mailing list reveal little).

peace,
-Vasily Lewis

The current fvwm2 beta (2.0.45) supports pixmaps in titlebars...
the syntax is covered in the man pages, and fvwm2 can even tile a pixmap 
on the handles/borders.  I've seen it done (let's see afterstep do that). ;)

I'm somewhat late into this thread, but I think that the two primitives
should be:

    Shell	makes a subshell

    Exec	forks a subshell with an implicit 'exec', or even just fork
		a process with no shell at all.  The fvwm command should
		mirror the behavior of the shell command by that name,
		because that's what people will expect it to do.

3 is overkill, but one is not enough.

On a related topic, I haven't been able to find any way of getting
FVWM to change the size or colouration of the size/move border. I
have been happy with it until a few days ago when I decided to do
my annual "reconfigure everything" trick, only to find that the
background I settled on makes the sizing border almost invisible.

I'm sure this is configurable though, but I can seem to find any
references to it anywhere (at least in fvwm, which is where I
would expect to find it).

Is the rplayd daemon running? Is it configured correctly with
all of the sound files named in rplay.conf? Does "rplay <sound>"
play ok from the command line?

What about "Exec (commands)"?

The bracketed command syntax is a reasonably well-known feature
for make and most UNIX shells.

Hi
Sorry I am sure I am asking something that is well documented, but as yet I     
havntfound out where! 
I want to switch desktops from an external ( to fvwm2 (or fvwm) command , say 
from within another application or from an xterm session. For example I may want
to spawn an image that is being raytraced on Desk 0 1 whilst editing that file 
on Desk 0 0.
Can this be done? 
Phil

My only wish is for moving this gradient stuff into some sort of library so
that modules could use it as well. FvwmButtons would sure look nice that way,
as well as FvwmIconMan or FvwmIconBox or any module which stays running for a
long time. 

This shouldn't happen though until after 2.0 gets officially released and
things have settled down. Many bugs and arguments over .fvw2rc syntax would
result.

More importantly, does the sound devices have the proper permissions. 
 The largest problem I keep having is the sound devices always coming 
up with read and write privalage only for root and the rplay daemon 
not running as root!

This would be disastrous, as it would break existing rc files that use Exec
expecting it to spawn a shell as it has done thus far. *If* a new keyword is
added, it has to reference the new functionality, not break the existing
functionality.

SO WHAT!  This is the reason that 2.0.x is labelled BETA.  Breaking people's
configurations is not sufficient reason to prevent a design change.  It
should be announced prominently, but people using beta software can be
reasonably expected to make small (or even large) changes to their
configuration files in the interest of having better quality in a RELEASE.

No, you make sweeping changes in alpha. When you've reached the beta stage,
you have to consider the scope and impact of your changes much more carefully.
In addition, 2.0.45 may be labelled "beta", but it has also been in circulation
for quite a while now, and has an established user base.

I have been playing around with the Desk command, but I am stumped on a few
things:

* How do you change between virtual screens on the same desk? "Desk 0 1" sends
  me to Desk 1.

* Is there a way to do any bounds checking on the desktop number? I don't use
  virtual desktops, just a 3x3 grid of virtual screens. "Desk 1" should cause
  an error, not spontaneously create Desk 1 and send me there.

GotoPage row col 

worked just fine for me.  I found this info in the fvwm2-man.html documentation.

I bound these to F1-F4 for my 2x2 Desktop.

Note:  "EdgeScroll 100 100"  probably helps makes this work as you would expect.

I don't see why you insist to consider that a problem. There simply exist
*several* packet types. Yes, the world of interface library making would be a
much easier place if there was only one type, but... ;-)

I don't exactly know how to do it in Perl, but if you don't mind looking at
something written in Python, you can look at my fvwm.py, posted in this list
just a few years ago :-)

I believe there's another Python interface, by Barry Warsaw. (He complained
recently about a common problem: *nobody* seems to be interested in these
interfaces... :-( )

Sigh,

Why do I find this a problem. Hmmmm.

How about this: all of the packets which contain data specific to one managed
window have this triple. Of course M_DESK doesn't, or M_STRING. But if a packet
pertains to a specific window, all other packet types have the triple. Except
M_MINI_ICON (unless you chose not to apply my patch to the windowshade packets,
in which case you have three packets that don't). The module docs not only
frequently refer to this triple is the means of identifying fvwm-managed
windows, it specifically refers to the third element, the "internal index"
(actually the hex representation of the struct's memory address), as well-
suited for use as an index of sorts for programs that list and index windows.

Yes, there are several packet types (more accurately, each packet is its own
type, there are several classes into which packets fall). But M_MINI_ICON has
a relationship to a specific subset of the packet types, and as such should
conform to them.

> Sigh,

Indeed.

Sorry, I didn't know M_MINI_ICON was window-specific (I have to add these new
packet types to fvwm.py one of these days). The "windowshade" ones must be
window-specific for sure!

my fvwm.py needs it (keeps track of windows, of course - I chose the wid for
it). I don't have fvwm sources handy, so I don't know what M_MINI_ICON is
supposed to do, but if it refers to a single window, the packet ought to carry
its id. If you say that the windowshade ones don't, that's strange... What are
the modules supposed to do with them then?

(I'll search for your patch)

PS:
I suppose this isn't exactly a popular theme in the list, since only the
module interface library programmers need to think of this. Let's see how many
for: the C library, yours in Perl, and the 2 (?) in Python... (I'm sure there's
a tcl library, but never heard of it)

Now, you module programmers: let's see those wonderful new modules you are
writing! As you see, there's plenty of language support for you ;-)

Hi there.

I know about ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick and about
MouseFocusClickRaises and I'd like a combination.  Would it be
difficult to add that in MouseFocus, the click that raises isn't
passed to the application?  As another GlobalOpt?

tkgoodstuff (of which I am author) has a tcl fvwm2 library.  I would love to
have mini-icon file names included in the M_MINI_ICON packet.

Yes-- the purpose of M_MINI_ICON is to inform a module of a mapping between
mini's and windows. Each window can conceivably have one. Part of the debate
over the packet format is based on the fact that the current implementation
sends the X server pixmap ID, which is not useful to non-C modules (which means
you actually have a stake in this :-).

The windowshade packets (M_WINDOWSHADE/M_DEWINDOWSHADE) only contained the
X window ID for the main window. My patch merely has them contain the regular
three values.

What I am beginning to wonder is the status of 2.0.46, or whatever is to follow
upon 2.0.45. I'd be happy to work up a patch for the M_MINI_ICON packet that
standardizes the integer args, leaves in the X ID for C programmers, and still
adds on the name for the rest of us (I believe the mini-icon name is stored in
the window struct, so that will be easy enough).

What I am nervous about is that with the variety of patches floating around--
my windowshade packet patch, the ColorLimit patch, etc.-- isn't it about time
a new "official beta" was cobbled together?

Here's a good one--

Since I don't necessarily have a specific MiniIcon for *every* app I run, is
there a way to have a ButtonStyle fall through to a vector style if there is
no MiniIcon to satisfy the "ButtonStyle x MiniIcon" directive? Or do I need to
come up with a "default" glyph to use with 'Style "*" MiniIcon ...'?

I switched to fvwm 2.0.45 from fvwm 1 recently, and encountered a very
annoying problem: fvwm2 would segfault whenever I tried to start a
module.  Further investigation revealed that this was because my paths
were long, causing message to overflow in SendDataToModule in read.c
when I tried to start a module.

[Note: I do not read either of these lists, so please send me a copy

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


I'm using fvwm v1.24r (using mwm until recently), and I've noticed that
when new windows pop up, they raise _and_ take the focus... which I find
extremely annoying.  Even though I've set ClickToFocus, it doesn't seem 
to apply to these new windows.  (mwm with ClickToFocus only raises new
windows.)

So, is there a way to have new windows popup but with out the focus?
Or perhaps I have something I don't want in my .fvwmrc that is causing
this behavior.

Also, is there a generic way to Style "new windows"?  If so, perhaps it'd
be easy to have them not get the focus...

Please send all replies cc'ed to tarvizo@mit.edu, because I'm not on
your mailing list.

Thanks a bunch,
Tresi Arvizo

Hello,

I'm the person who installed the local copy of fvwm2, which
is why I'm following up to Aaron's message.

As a short term solution to this problem, I could recompile our
version of fvwm2 to use a fixed-length buffer of greater length.
A better solution might be to come up with a correct way to pass
information into pipes.

I haven't programmed enough myself to know what the correct way to
do this is.  Is there a Right Way to pass variable-length data from
one process to another?

Thanks,

Hi

I hope this request for info is acceptable - please let me know if it
isn't.  

I'm using FVWM 1.xx that came with my distribution.  It's throwing
windows taller and wider than the current page.  In netscape this is
particulary bad - the mail window is so tall - I have to jump to the
adjoining page and shrink the mail window (usually 3 or 4 inches) with
the title bar.

Am I doing somthing wrong?  Am I overlooking a fix?  Thanks.

No, you're not doing anything wrong.  You just need a little information 
you haven't found yet.

Most applications will allow you to specify the size and placement of
their windows.  I don't have the information handy right now, but I think
if you man fvwm and look at the section on geometry you'll find what you
need. 

Also take a look at the Netscape app-defaults file.  I think there are
geometry entries in there -- just edit them to taste.

You can set geometry and other program settings in your ~/.Xdefault file.
Here's a part of it:

Netscape*Navigator.geometry:    =730x740
Netscape*Mail.geometry:         =730x740
Netscape*News.geometry:         =730x740
Netscape*Composition.geometry:  =730x740
Netscape*bookmarks.geometry:    =500x740-1+0
Netscape*blinkingEnabled:       False
Netscape*defaultBackground:     White

xkeycaps.geometry:              780x390
pixmap.geometry:                700x720
Xedit*geometry:                 650x550+0+0

I haven't yet found out what the exact difference is between using a "*"
or a ".", but what the h@#$, it's working... ;)

Hope this helps...

It will be 2.0.46, since a few more things still need to be cleaned up
before 2.1.0 can be put out there.

As for it's status, I've done a little on it, but not enough yet.

Why, you ask?  To elaborate slightly on FAQ question #34 for this
particular situation, I've been insanely busy with work, my martial
arts school, repairs & upgrades to my home computer, getting ill
(which has been happening all too often this past year), going out of
town to visit family, having all 4 wisdom teeth removed (which
actually went quite well), etc., and haven't quite had a chance to
finish up what I wanted to get in there (and been real quiet on the
lists, as I'm sure people have noticed).

But...things are looking up right now and I hope to have some time in
the next couple of weeks to finish some stuff and finially get it out,
as it has been a while (and I really want to sit down and do some work
on it), but as always I make no guarantees...

Well, as I often like to say and put int the FAQ a while back, not all
patches that get submitted get into the distribution, but I do agree
with your patches to standardize the last few module packets and have
no problems with adding the filename to the mini icon packet.  As for
the colorlimit patch, I'll have to look at that one again.  Right now
I don't recall what my feelings were about it when it was first
posted.

But I have all of the submitted patches lying around and will try to
look into most of them for 2.0.46.  Some of them have already been
integrated and/or added to my list to investigate.

R> isn't it about time a new "official beta" was cobbled together?

As soon as I get a chance.  Remember, they say that patience is a
virtue, and good things come to those who wait. :)

Now, I must get back to work...

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hello,

I have somehow mucked up my fvwm2 configuration file such that windows
no longer show an outline during a "Move" or "Resize" function. A little
window pops up which shows the position of the upper left corner of the
moving window. I don't know what I've done wrong and I can't find
documentation to tell me how to fix this annoying behavior.

BTW, I'm running fvwm2.0.45 under Red Hat linux (4.1).

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks...

Try the following. Clicking on the titlebar will raise a window, double
clicking will WindowShade the window:

Mouse 1         T       A       Move-or-Raise
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "C" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "D" WindowShade

Well I don't want  to be  pushy, but bear  in mind,  the colorlimiting
patch directly addresses these 2 items from the fvwm2 TO-DO list.

  - Reduce number of colors used in xpms included
  - Reduced (limit Xpm choices) color set

If you do include it, please remember to remove those 2 lines from the
TO-DO list, my patch neglected to do that.

Put a line like the following into your config file:

    XORValue 12

Some people think 255 is a good value.

A "*" is a wildcard. If, for example, the exact resource string
was:

        xkeycaps.window1.widget2.hsize

Then this would match:

        xkeycaps*widget2.hsize: 50
  and
        xkeycaps*widget2*hsize: 50
  but not
        xkeycaps.hsize: 50

In fact, "*" can match not only '.', but any character. So

        xkeycaps*size:  50

matches any resource string that starts with "xkeycaps" and
ends with "size". Obviously, you have to be a little careful
with that. similarly, if you wanted to match all widgets on
a particular window, then you can:

        xkeycaps*widget*.hsize: 50

Same thing with fonts too, btw. It is sort of a very primitive
(glob-like) string matching method that is much cheaper than
regular expressions.

It only happens part of the time, not all the time, sometimes only a
couple of windows will not open, other times, all will, then sometimes
most won't.  I'm running Solaris 2.5.1 with X11R6.3 and the Openwindows
Xsun for compatability with the video display.  It seems to be even worse
with fvwm2 than with 1.24r.  Anyone else?  This is becoming a major
issue.

Hi Hector,

   I've come up with the answer to making the Start menu pop up when the
start button is pressed, not waiting for it to be released.

   First, change modules/FvwmTaskBar.c:LoopOnEvents as follows (near
line 861):

      case ButtonPress:
        RadioButton(&buttons, -1, BUTTON_UP); /* no windows focused
anymore */
	if (MouseInStartButton(Event.xbutton.x, Event.xbutton.y)) {
	  StartButtonUpdate(NULL, BUTTON_DOWN);
          x = win_x;
          if (win_y < Midline) {
            /* bar in top half of the screen */
            y = win_y + RowHeight;
          } else {
            /* bar in bottom of the screen */
            y = win_y - ScreenHeight;
          }
          sprintf(tmp,"Menu \"%s %d %d\"", StartPopup, x, y);
          SendFvwmPipe(tmp, ItemID(&windows, 0));
	  XUngrabPointer(Event.xbutton.display, Event.xbutton.time);

   The two relevant changes are changing from Popup to Menu, so the
Start menu is properly sticky, and adding the XUngrabPointer call, so
the menu comes up instantly on button press.

   Second, change fvwm/builtins.c:staysup_func as follows:

  ...
  ActiveItem = NULL;
  ActiveMenu = NULL;
  menuFromFrameOrWindowOrTitlebar = FALSE;

  do_menu(menu,1);

  if(menu_name != NULL)
  ...

   In other words, get rid of the case analysis which makes the popup
sticky only if the event was a button press. Incidentally, you can do
the same thing at the end of window.c too.

   Third, change fvwm/menus.c:UpdateMenu as follows:

	case ButtonPress:
	  sticks = 0;
	case KeyPress:
	case VisibilityNotify:
	  done=1;
	  break;

   In other words, catching a button press makes the window non-sticky.
This handles both the case that the menu was popped up by a key and the
case where it is popped up by a button in a different process (such as a
module).

   It should be clear that this is the right way to fix the problem (if
for no other reason than the too-sticky problem is solved once, in
UpdateMenu, rather than in two different places). What makes the problem
tricky is that the button release event from clicking the start button
may go to either FvwmTaskBar or fvwm, depending on the timing.

   Since much of the affected code is in fvwm proper, not just fvwm95,
I've cc'ed the fvwm mailing list. I'm not sure if this is the right
process, but it should at the very least get the patches to the people
that need them.

Hi all,

working on Solaris 2.5 with fvwm 2.0.43.

I'm working on an app with the inputs hint set to false, and WM_TAKE_FOCUS
set.  That should mean, I guess, according to the man page, that focus is
not explicitly set by fvwm, but rather, a message to take focus is sent to
my client.  This works, as far as I can tell, with focus follows mouse
mode.

However, on ClickToFocus mode, when I click on the title bar, the window
has focus, but when I release it, it loses focuses to the last window that
has focus.  My click is assigned to Raise-Or-Move.  The problem seems to be
in misc.c:GrabEm() and UngrabEm(), which sets Scr.PreviousFocus to Scr.Focus
and then later resets Scr.Focus to Scr.PreviousFocus.  Except that in this
case, because I've got my app set up the way I do, SetFocus() never assigns
the Scr.Focus pointer, and so when GrabEm()/UngrabEm() are called from
ComplexFunction(), the focus is lost to whatever Scr.Focus is set to.

That's my read on the code -- now can someone tell me if this is a bug?  =b

Thanks,
Eric

I spent the weekend rewriting the menu code for fvwm-2.0.45 to better
support the keyboard (improving on my earlier patch).  In the process I
added several other useful features.  The description of the patch
appears below.  The actual patch is available at:
<A HREF="
http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/gjb/patches/fvwm-2.0.45-menus-animation-gjb.patch
"> patch </A>

To apply the patch, do something like

cd fvwm-2.0.45
patch -p1 <fvwm-2.0.45-menus-animation-gjb.patch

Look for *.rej files, then rebuild.  The description and patch are also
available on my web page under "Newer stuff."  I tested the changes and
applying the patch on a slackware-like Linux 2.0.29. The patch should
apply cleanly to an unmodified 2.0.45 tree.

Please cc: comments to me.  I read the fvwm-workers list regularly, but
I don't subscribe to the fvwm list currently.

DESCRIPTION:
------------
This patch includes lots:

Added new commands:

  AnimatedMove -- works like move

  SetAnimation -- customizes how the animated moves (and menu movement) looks

  SetMenuDelay -- change how long to delay before popping up a submenu
                  when resting on a menu item (ala the famous win OS's menus)

  SetEnv       -- Allow setting of environment which processes started
                  by fvwm2 will inherit.  This uses "putenv" system call.

Changed commands:

  Move   -- added greater flexibility so you can give destination
positions as stuff like "w+5p" to mean current window position + 5
pixels or "-2" to mean its right edge should be 2% of the screen height
> from the bottom [works for horizonal, too, of course].  See new man page

  MenuStyle -- added "animated" qualifier, along with type "win" to
               emulate more closely the famous win OS's menus look and feel

  AddToMenu --  Menus titles take side-pixmaps between "@" (at) characters and
		side-pixmap background colors between "^" (caret) characters.  Also,
		substrings denoting regular pixmaps (between "%" characters) are removed
		even if that pixmap cannot be located; thus your menu still looks ok.  A
		warning is printed to stderr, instead.


Almost complete rewrite of menus code:
--------------------------------------
These new menus support the keyboard much better than before.  See the
improved man page.  They also can animate out of your way when at the
right edge of the screen.  Use animated menustyle and try it-- it's
easier to watch than explain.  Also now supported is a delay before
popping up child menus when you rest on a menu item.

Note that the animation and the menu delay require the "usleep"
(micro-second sleep) system call.  If you don't have it, "select" can
probably be contorted to do the right thing.  See the man page for
"select" for your OS.


Internal Changes
----------------
I reindent some places where the indentation was not uniform and
confusing.  I also changed a lot of #define-s to enum-s. Menu code is
*way* better now (though certainly could get even better-- in
particular, I didn't do anything specific to facilitate sticky menus).

Uses gperf to build "fvwm-command-hasher.c" which gets included by
functions.c.  Reworked functions.c to use a hash lookup on a built-in's
name instead of linear lookup.  Reduced my startup time by 15% or so.
You may need to give -DNO_GPERF if you have problems with this.


BUGS?
-----
Sure, there's gotta be plenty.  Email me at gjb@cs.washington.edu and let
me know.  In particular, send me a minimal startup file and descriptions
of what to do to see the problem.  Also send me your configure.h, I
suppose and tell me what platform you're working on.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  I am not responsible for the use of, the misuse
of, or anything to do with this patch.

Hi there!

Is there a replacement for the warp-command from the old fvwm
to focus to a particular window?

Also I would like to set some hotkeys to switch between virtual screens
(maybe even on different desktops) w/o using the pager & mouse.


Thanks for any help!

Sascha.

Wouldn't a Linux-like tree be best?

Release stable code as 2.2.0, with patches for bug fixes to 2.2.X
Start development work on 2.3.0, with development patches to 2.3.X

Just a thought.

Try this:

Use something like this for screens, check the man page for desks:

# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100

I selected the restart option off my fvwm2 menu.

Somehow, immediately after selecting the option, I managed to hit another
mouse button on the root window, in time for it to switch to menu mode
before restarting.

It wasn't pretty:
1. I couldn't move the pointer off that one monitor (I have three on this
sparc 20, whee!) 
2. The mouse pointer was menu pointer
3. A fvwm window frame with handles and the title "untitled" appeared with
flat grey contents where the menu would have appeared
4. I couldn't cancel the menu mode by clicking in the root window
5. I couldn't focus any xterms to do anything about it

I ended up telnetting in and killing one fvwm2 process at random (there
were three), all three monitors indicated all the fvwm2 processes being
killed and xdm cycled through a login session.

I'm not worried about the logout, that seems proper.  I'm worried about the
lockup when the menu appeared.

I compiled 2.0.45 under Solaris 5.5.1 and have a call to FvwmButtons
in my initfunction. It however fails to show up and ps -e cannot find
it

I have a similar problem with fvwm95-2.0.43a

The same config file when run by a colleague under Linux 1.2.13 has no
problem

Any suggestions, Cheers, Yusuf

I'm also experiencing similar problems with FvwmButtons. I'm running 2.0.45
under SunOS 4 and cannot get FvwmButtons to swallow or show buttons. When
I start up FvwmButtons, either through FvwmTalk, or upon startup, the 
applications to be swallowed popup, but they are not swallowed, and the other
buttons I've defined also do not appear. I've set FvwmButtons to try to swallow
x programs such as xclock and also FvwmPager without success. Any suggestions
anyone?

I am running (the one and only) Fvwm Version 2.0.45 on a SunOS box.

I'm trying to get some exposure to the FvwmCascade and the FvwmTile
modules.

I am looking for a way to take a set of windows (say the one on my
current desk) and organize them in a way that I'll get the most of
each window on my screen.

For example, having four xterm windows, I would like to be able to
place them in a way that each will hold one quarter of the screen
without overlapping (resizing if needed is o,k).

I tried the FvwmTile (Module FvwmTile -h 0 0 97 97) and FvwmCascade
(Module FvwmCascade -resize -incx 5 -incy 5 0 0) and It's not doing
what I'm looking for.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Yehuda.

I'm switching to SCO Open Server 5.0.2 after 2+ years of using FVWM on
Open Server 3.0.

So far I've run into a pretty clean compile of 2.0.39 (which I was using
on OS3) but a few problems with modules/FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c.

I'm going to try compiling 2.0.45, but I'd like to know if anyone else has
successfully completed compiling 2.0.XX on SCO Open Server 5.0.2.

Thanks!  I'll post problems if I can't solve them, which is very likely :)

Keyboarding worked great.  Animation was neat.

The default animation backup and  then move forward effect didn't seem
to add anything for me, but I was using a  slow machine (Sparc 1+).  I
didn't experiment with other animation values.

I was torn between the reverse imaging effect from the "win" menus and
the 3d appearance from  the "mwm" menus.   I'm  not sure how  it would
look  but too bad I couldn't  use both 3d  appearance and the stronger
feedback from reverse imaging the current selection.

By creating menu styles of "fvwm", "mwm"  and "win", we sort of create
packages  of effects.  If  you want "auto-popup", you  can get it with
mwm or win.  If you want 3d you can get it with fvwm or mwm.  It might
be nice to just specify the effects wanted.

I was  able to fool  the animation logic  that tries to put  the mouse
pointer back where it  started by moving  the pointer out of  the left
side of a menu.  I had to go out of  my way to do  this, and don't see
how anyone could be disturbed by this.

I had linking problems with usleep.  I read that if I use Solaris 2.5,
usleep would have been  OK.  I changed  the code to  use select, and I
read that I could have used poll.  I guess that using usleep is OK.

I  think this is   a great package  of changes.   I  don't see why  it
shouldn't be incorporated into a future release.

It looks like your C preprocessor is not expanding the GetDecor macro
properly, or that something is interfering with it's expansion.  It
should work, so please check to see how the macro at screen.h:332: is
expanding.  Also, see how it compiles without -DUSEDECOR (it will use
an alternate but simpler macro which will limit you to a single
decor), and if possible, obtain preprocessor output with and without
the -DUSEDECOR define (this is usually possible with a compiler
switch).

Good luck,
Andrew

I would like to pop up a menu and use the arrow keys to scroll through
the entries without leaving the menu.  Currently, the cursor can be
moved anywhere in the desktop using the arrow keys.
Is there a way to restrict the motion using the arrow keys? 

Thank you for your help.

Hi,

1.) How can I prevent the mouse-cursor from moving approximately 15
pixels back on scrolling the desktop? We are using here fvwm 1.2? on
solaris 5.5? My values are e.g. EgdeResistance 0 50 and EdgeScroll 5 5.
Each time I move the mouse e.g. to the right edge of the screen the
desktop scrolls (that`s O.K.) but my mouse jumps several pixels back.
It`s annoying because you can`t scroll a desktop 3x2 without moving the
mouse several times over the pad.
2.) When I click in GoodStuff to open a program the GoodStuff-window is
active. How can I leave the last window active or said in others words:
How can I use GoodStuff without making the GoodStuff-window active?
3.) When I change the desktop using the pager a window not visible on
the current desktop can still be active. Is there a routine to make the
frontmost window on the current desktop automatically active?

Thanks for your reply (if you want)

Hi, I'm set up the following in my .fvwmrc file:
This is in my menu selection:
        Exec    "Xterm"         exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -fg black -bg white -T `
hostname` -n `hostname` -ls &

And this using Goodstuff:
*GoodStuff Xterm xterm2.xpm Exec "Xterm" /usr/bin/X11/xterm -fg black -bg white
-ls  -T `hostname` -n `hostname`&

When I launch an xterm using the Xterm button defined by Goodstuff, the xterm
shows a proper title with the hostname of my machine. But by calling up an      
xterm using the menu, the name of the xterm shows up at
hostnamehostname.

Any ideas?

I'm working with RedHat 4.1 and am trying to configure the
default MenuTaskBar mail program to Pine instead of /bin/mail.

The little mail icon pops up via 'biff' in the lower right hand corner, 
and when I click on it it executes /bin/mail.  

I have been able to configure most other applications in the
/etc/X11/TheNextLevel directory, however I have not been able to find
the file which holds the command that is executing this program to change
it from mail to pine.

If anyone could point me in the correct direction I would be greatly 
appreciative.

Thanks in advance,

-=Robert Jordan=-

Read the FvwmTaskBar man page (`man FvwmTaskBar') and search for
`FvwmTaskBarMailCommand'.  That'll give you a place to start.

I've been running Fvwm2 for several months now with no problems and have 
recently found TkGoodstuff. 
 
After looking at TkGoodstuff it appears that it does almost exactly the same 
thing as FvwmButtons. 
 
Can anyone give me a reason why I would want to use one utility over the other? 
 
The only thing that I see different is that TkGoodstuff provides a preferences 
manager instead of manually having to edit the .fvwm2rc file. 
 
I have preferred so far to use FvwmButtons since it is a part of fvwm and 
therefore I don't have to manage 2 programs and keep 2 config files etc..., 
however, if there are advantages of using TkGoodstuff I'd be glad to use it. 
 
A comparision between the 2 tools would be great! 
 
Please email me directly as I am not getting all mailing list mail. 
 
Thanks,

This is not actually true.

TkGoodstuff:
  - Has the preferences manager, as you pointed out.  This is actually
    pretty nice.

  - Is written in TCL/Tk, and has a number of embedded applications like
    webster, ical monitor, load monitor, pager of sorts, clock, network
    uptime monitor, notetaker, etc.  Since they're all more-or-less
    embedded, they don't take up extra process space/memory--of course,
    the tcl/tk interpreter itself is no small puppy :)

  - You need to install the right version of tcl/tk before you can use
    it.

FvwmButtons:
  - Is much a smaller app

  - But it must launch a separate program for everything: clock,
    etc. etc. so it may well turn out to use more resources, depending
    on what you use.

  - Is more flexible and configurable than TkGoodstuff: for example, in
    my version of TkGoodstuff (which isn't the latest) you can bind
    actions only to mouse-1 clicks.  In FvwmButtons you can bind to all
    kinds of events.

  - Gets the window geometry and icon placement correct more often
    (although TkGoodstuff is improving a lot here).

  - Doesn't need tcl/tk :)

I use TkGoodstuff right now, but I haven't thrown out my FvwmButtons
config yet...

do a "make" on any module that uses libfvwm2.a ...

Subject: FVWM: Compiling fvwm2 on SCO 5.0.2 - cpp problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I'm continuing my attempt to compile the fvwm2 window manager on my SCO
OpenServer 5.0.2 system. (It's basically unusable until I can get this
done! please help!)

Users have suggested I look into c preprocessor macro expansion problems
which we believe are causing at least part of my problem.

It appears as though the expanded macros have more spaces in them than
the c compiler would like to see.

Here's a snippet from the original code, in add_window.c:

----------------------------------------------------------------
/* ORIGINAL CODE WHICH CAUSES SCO COMPILER TO PRODUCE AN ERROR
  tmp_win->title_height = GetDecor(tmp_win,TitleHeight) + tmp_win->bw;
*/

/* THIS LINE, WHICH SHOULD BE EXPANED BY THE MACRO, COMPILES. */
  tmp_win->title_height = ( ( tmp_win )->fl->TitleHeight ) +
tmp_win->bw;
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what cc -E add_window.c (with all other Makefile options like
-DUSEDECOR added, also.)

# 227
  tmp_win->title_height =  ( ( tmp_win ) -> fl ->TitleHeight ) + tmp_win
-> bw ;

I'm guessing that with the extra spaces, the compiler doesn't recognize
-> for pointers and is producing errors.  The above code is exactly this
minus the spaces and seems to compile fine.

Here's the macro, unmodified:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
/* FROM screen.h THE ORIGINAL MACRO CODE
   Macro which gets specific decor or default decor.
   This saves an indirection in case you don't want
   the UseDecor mechanism.
 */
#ifdef USEDECOR     /* THIS IS WHAT i WANT TO USE */
#define GetDecor(window,part) ((window)->fl->##part)
#else
#define GetDecor(window,part) (Scr.DefaultDecor.##part)
#endif
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd appreciate any help, especially if there are c/cpp switches I can
use to overcome this.  I'm 80% done, but this last 20% is not so easy.

THANKS! (PLEASE HELP!?!)

I'm pretty sure I've heard references to there being an archive of list 
messages. I am about to mail out my patch to flesh out the M_MINI_ICON packet
(which includes patching modules/FvwmIconMan/fvwm.c, the only other user in
the distributed source base). I am also about to release the first beta of my
Perl 5 module for Fvwm. In it, I now mention that the config item ColorLimit
is contingent upon application of the color-limiting patch, and that the 
M_WINDOWSHADE and M_DEWINDOWSHADE packets only return 3 ints if you've applied
my patch for those packets. My next X11::Fvwm release will expect M_MINI_ICON
packets to be patched, as well. I think that it is in my best interest to
include copies of the relevant patches until the Fvwm author has the time to
make the next release (because I *don't* want to be responsible for him feeling
rushed to do so). So I need copies of my windowshade patch, and the color-limit
patch. I would prefer copies of the original messages, so that headers are
intact, given the author of the color-limit patch due credit.

Wed Apr 30 14:18:55 MDT 1997

Version 0.3 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days.

This is the first beta release. Not all planned features are in, not all
data packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
style and overall functionality are now fairly stable, and drastic changes
should be minimal from this point on. Changes in this version are listed below.
There are not a lot of changes, as 0.2 was pretty clean.

>From the README file for 0.3:

X11::Fvwm version 0.3 (beta 1)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with either the Tk extension or the Xforms library as
your GUI choices!

This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is
very highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk
(which is Tk400.202 as of this writing) or X11::Xforms (0.7 or better),
also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

>From the Changes file for 0.3:

* Only major change: The use of asterisk (*) to specify directives to the
  getConfigInfo method has been deprecated in favor of the dash (-). You will
  currently be warned when getConfigInfo encounters the old style, but the
  first official release (whenever I reach a stable 1.0) will remove this
  entirely.

* Tentative support of X11::Xforms (version 0.7 or later) added.

* More demo scripts added.

* Some minor cleanup here and there. Little of this, as 0.2 was pretty stable.

* All *.pm have documentation (though some demos still need it).

Then the compiler's parser is broken. Both lines of code are syntactically
identical.

IMHO, get and install gcc. I don't know which version of "SCO" you're using,
but in the R3.2 days circa 1991 or so, their compiler is very, very broken.
We used gcc for any reasonably sized projects, relegating SCO's only to
building device drivers and reconfiguring/relinking the kernel.
