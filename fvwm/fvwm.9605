That would be a wonderful idea.  For case 'c)' perhaps (is it possible) to
assign an app with too many colors a private colormap from the window manager?

Can apps have 'shaired-private' colormaps incase some of the colors are the
same?  (anybody know a good X tutorial I could poke at to see what really IS
possible with regards to colormap manipulation?)..

Just some thoughts..

One thing I have noticed on restarts is that even though the cursor is over
a window and point-focus is in effect, I must move the cursor to the boarder
and back to get fvwm to give the window focus.

Is this supposed to happen, as I would hope that a simple test upon restart
would suffice to keep this from occurring..

I just installed the latest fvwm 2.0.42, and converted my old .fvwmrc 
using the shell-script in the package (+ some minor hacking) - I think it 
is very good, but I have one problem irritating me. In the new version
clicking one time and releasing the mouse on a FvwmButton where a menu 
should appear the menu disappears - and if I start (single click) a menu on 
the canvas (background) the menus stays there. Can I have the opposite 
effect (actually the old stuff) by changing a Style parameter ??

I think I have found a bug in FvwmForm.

In the man page it says:

---- Start of included text -----------------------8<--- cut here -------------
     $(name)         If name corresponds to a text  input  field,
                     the result is the user's input string.  Spe-
                     cial chars such as ", ', and  will  be  pre-
                     ceded by a backslash.

                     If name corresponds to a choice, the  result
                     is  the value of the choice (as specified in
                     *FvwmFormChoice) if the choice is  selected.
                     If the choice is not selected, the result is
                     a blank string.

---- End of included text -------------------------8<--- and here -------------

but in fact (in my experience) $(name) expands to its value
whether it is set or not!

Also why is it not possible to use the same name (with different
values of course) for more than one choice.  It would be very
natural and useful.

If anyone is interested I can send you my Xrsh form (now
working!), which allows you to choose a programme and host to run
it on with just 2 mouse clicks. :-)

Here you go.  As it is, it assumes you have `xrsh' from X contrib
(I guess the old `xon' would be good enough in many cases) and
that you are parsing your .fvwm2rc with `m4'.  If you're not
using `m4' and you don't want to, then just replace "HOSTMAP" by
its definition everywhere....  The `m4' parsing would be
completely unnecessary here, if $(name) worked as documented. :-(

Enjoy and do send me any improvements you make.

Jens

ps Of course you have to bind the form to something, right?  I

Hello there

a week or so ago there was a discussion of a reduced colour map
of 16 (?) colours for the mini.* icons and perhaps 32 for larger
ones.  Has anything come of this ?  If so, can someone mail me
a XPM with all the relevant colours showing so that I can
construct my own icons with the same colour selections.

Thanks

Ian

Not *totally* related to the preceding comments... but I've noticed that
on a 16 bpp and 32 bpp display, the FvwmForms come out in black-and-white,
with no shading of gray scale.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Hi, after a little debacle getting FVWM compiled I sat down
to enjoy using it again...only to log in and have the
computer log me out. I presume FVWM is crashing out straight
away...check my errors file:

ld.so.1: /home7/dcjk/bin/fvwm: fatal: libXpm.so.4.8: can't open file: errno=2

Aha! I recently (since last time I used Fvwm) got new Xpm libraries.

So, this is Fvwm 2.0.42, on Solaris 2.5 - how do I go about fixing this
problem...indeed, in plain speak, what *is* the problem? 

Other programs like the Xpm libs fine, I'm not sure where the error lies.

(Usually recompiling Fvwm is trivial!)

Try adding:

Style "*" Lenience

to your .fvwm2rc.  From the man page:

          Lenience instructs fvwm to ignore the convention in the
          ICCCM  which  states  that  if  an application sets the
          input field of the wm_hints structure to False, then it
          never  wants  the  window  manager to give it the input
          focus.  The only application that I know of which needs
          this  is  sxpm,  and that is a silly bug with a trivial
          fix and has no overall effect on  the  program  anyway.
          Rumor  is  that  some  older applications have problems
          too.

If you reduce your regular  icons to a  set of 32  colors, you may  as
well reduce the mini-icons to the same set of 32 colors.

For the  fvwm icons, this is on  the todo list  and Chuck has  said he
will get around to it.

I  made  an attempt to  provide  a program   that automates  the color
reduction and you will find the program in  fvwm 2.0.42 in the "utils"
directory.    Subsequently   Romano  Giannetti  and   Martin   Kraemer
introduced "pixy2" which outclasses my effort with a much better color
matching algorithm.  Pixy2 can be gotten from:

ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy3.2.tar.gz

You   may need to   export   LD_LIBRARY_PATH with  the directory  that
contains the xpm library.  For example, my setting:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/xpm/lib:/usr/ucblib

[Discussion snipped of why Fvwm now dies on me with an error:

Any help welcomed.]

Dan reckoned LD_LIBRARY_PATH might need tweaked.

I thought of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and attempted to make doubly sure that it
is set like this: (from my .xinitrc, it should already be set)
-----
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/lib

Unless I have made a mistake with the syntax here this pretty much rules out
a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH does it not? I'm puzzled!

Since you are on Solaris, when in doubt,  use truss!  Start fvwm2 like
this:

truss fvwm2 2>/var/tmp/fvwm.truss

Then search the resulting /var/tmp/fvwm.truss for "xpm".  It should be
clear where fvwm2 is looking for the shared object.

Actually, it might be the link order of your X libs.  I compiled it
like so:

          xlc xtest.c -o xtest -lXaw -lXt -lXmu -lXext -lX11

But from your Imakefile, it looks like you are putting the X11 lib
before the others.  Bad move, since the Xaw (Xm too) & Xt override
things in X11 which cause oddities if you change the link order.  So I
tried your link order:

          xlc xtest.c -o xtest -lX11 -lXt -lXaw -lXmu -lXext

And I saw the same problem you are having.  So, change your link order
to have Xaw before Xt before X11, and things should be ok.

I do something similar:

ColormapFocus FollowsFocus

and make Netscape be clicktofocus (I also make my buttonbar
clicktofocus).  Then, by keeping netscape -install on a desk by
itself, that desk only needs to be color flashed when I enter it.  As
soon as I click on Netscape, that desk will have the Netscape colormap
as long as I stay in it unless I click on the button bar.  I usually
don't like this mode of operation - I prefer mouseless as much as
possible, but since you pretty much can't avoid the mouse with
netscape anyway...

That happens if your colormap gets filled up.  One kluge workaround is
to start an FvwmForm window (and keep it around) to allocate those
colors before starting any other apps.  I actually do that because I
use an FvwmForm as a replacement for FvwmTalk, and discovered that it
fixed my loss of FvwmForm color problem by accident :-)

This, of course, assumes that all your FvwmForms use the same set of
colors.

How about a quick explaination (to save my lazy mind from having to read
the manuals.) of what a desktop and a page is?

Right now I have fvwm setup on SCO (amazing! it compiled.) With FvwmPager
0 2.  Does this mean 4 desktops? I can't move from one to the other
without clicking on the Pager to do so.  As this is SCO not Linux, I also
have only a single 1024x768 screen, with no scrolling or panning to make
it appear 1600x1200 or something. This setup works, but I think it'd be
nice to have six+ windows on a "page?" and just scrol arond rather than
switching to other desktops all the time.

Any tips on how to set things up better? Thanks!

	I haven't seen _this_ problem with netscape, but I have had another
weird problem occur. I can't yet duplicate it reliably, but it seems to
occur when you start a netscape browser on one virtual screen, and then
move it to another virtual screen. Clicking with mouse button two on
a link then causes a new browser to pop up on the ORIGINAL virtual screen
and not on the current one. I know that this happens with the news
browser; I'm pretty sure I've had it happen with html as well.

	As for your geometry problems, I don't know what is going wrong.
I set some geometries in my .Xresources file, and they work just fine.
Dunno about command line resources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(from the Release Notes)

To set sizes of individual windows: set the following X resources 

       Netscape*Navigator.geometry: WxH+X+Y      for the browser windows
       Netscape*Mail.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the mail window
       Netscape*News.geometry: WxH+X+Y           for the news window
       Netscape*Bookmark.geometry: WxH+X+Y       for the bookmark window
       Netscape*AddressBook.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the addressbook window
       Netscape*Composition.geometry: WxH+X+Y    for the composition window

       Netscape*TopLevelShell.geometry: WxH+X+Y  sets all of the above windows
       to be the same size.

       The -geometry command line option sets the sizes of just the browser, mail and news
       windows.

	Aha! I thought maybe this problem was caused by something in my
.fvwm2rc, but perhaps not. I see this also. My cursor starts up in
the center of the screen overtop an xterm. But it doesn't have focus,
and clicking won't give it focus. The only way to do so is move the
mouse out and back in. 
	This is why I was raising that fuss about Focus warping the
mouse cursor last week. I stuck a Next [xterm CurrentDesk] Focus in
my InitFunction, and it was warping up to the corner of the screen 
and bugging the heck out of me.
	This occurs both on startup and restart for me.

Mmm, that gave this result. I'm unsure what the end few lines mean, does it

Should this not be libfvwm.a if I asked for it to build fvwm and not fvwm2??
We don't have (never used) fvwm1 so there was no need to name it fvwm2 really,
it only caused confusion.

This might be the problem then? If so (seems likely but I don't understand much of
this!) how can I tell the makefile that I *want* fvwm and not fvwm2 in *all* cases?

I've noticed similar behavior where occasionally focus will just go
off into limbo.  I first noticed it with XEmacs under ctwm, but I've
since verified the same behavior with Grail (a Tk based application)
under ctwm, both major revs of fvwm, and tvtwm (all twm decendents?)
but not, if I remember correctly, the SGI Irix window manager.  I
think I tried dtwm but can't remember what the behavior was there.

Anyway, what happens is that if I delete an XEmacs frame, even though
the cursor is still over a different XEmacs frame, keyboard focus just
goes nowhere.  Not to the root window, not to any window!   Fvwm does
show me that no window has the focus, by way of no border highlight.

Grail does the same thing.  If say you popup the 'find' dialog, enter
a search string, hit return, the window gets withdrawn and again, even
though the cursor is over a different Grail window, nothing is getting
further keystrokes.  You have to manually move the cursor out of the
window border, then back in, to regain keyboard focus.

Its very strange and I don't know who's at fault.  I'll have to see if
I can get a reproducible test case going, perhaps using Python/Tk.

This probably has nothing to do with your problem, but I thought I'd
mention it.

I have found there are some subtle differences with Solaris 2.5
dynamic linker/loader.  It is especially noticable on our x86
machines.  Solaris/Sparc is I'd say 99% indistinguishable from
Solaris/Intel, from a users (and even developers) perspective, but the
one gotcha that I've had to deal with is the use of -L and -R flags
for dynamic linking.  On Sparc I'd usually just used the -L flag to
get the dynlib paths compiled into the binary, so no tweaking of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH was necessary.  On Intel, -L alone wouldn't do it.
You had to use -R.

I've taken to hacking the Openwin imake config files to add the -R
flag for both platforms since it certainly doesn't hurt for Sparc.  I
think I added -R to sun.cf's ExtraLoadFlags...

Yes.   Sure is looking a  lot  of places, including /usr/openwin/lib 3
times.  You  want  to  pay attention  to  this,  it has  an  impact on
performance.

Not sure why you are using "setenv".  (I am not a csh user.)  Try the
more common "/bin/sh" syntax:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Don't worry about the .a, it's for linking modules against.  It is not
used at run time.

Erm, pardon my earlier post where I asked about why there was an fvwm2
lib, I missed the fact that there was also an fvwm lib.
I had simply tried a recompile from scratch with some tinkering and
had forgotten to define rename. Neither (fvwm, fvwm2) worked.

Has anyone else compile fvwm with the latest Xpm lib had any similar 
problem? (scratching head, I don't know why it refuses to work)

I was thinking about a framework where you could start a module up at
init time, have it hang around long lived, and have fvwm send it
command strings based on user configuration.  I'm sort of new to the
modules interface, but my take on it is that if you have a long lived
module, it will only ever get the initial arguments used when starting
the module.  From then on, there's no way a users configuration could
instruct fvwm to talk directly to the module -- it would only get the
events outlined in the module API document.

That's fine.  What I would do is add a new command to fvwm, that would
have the following interface:

    SendToModule <module> <string>

This would generate a new packet type and send it only to the module
in question.  Hmm, maybe there'd be a similar BroadcastToModules
command?  The packet would contain header, 'the usual window ids',
then the variable length string.

What I'm thinking about is a long lived Python helper module which
would react to these commands, updating its state, sending new
commands back to fvwm, importing Python modules as needed, etc.  I'm
not quite sure what I'd do with it, but I have a few modules now that
I use, and for one thing, I'd like to not have to fire up a Python
interpreter each time.  I could easily accomplish this with this type
of framework.

Any thoughts?
-Barry

Barry> Did this go away?  I think it was there for 1.24r, but it seems like
Barry> rubberband resize is the only option for 2.0.42.

  It is actually quite easy to re enable this feature IF one doesn't mind
  having opaque resize ON for ALL windows, i.e. no per window/class/etc
  opaque resize.

  The patch below does it in its simplest form by defining a static
  variable within resize.c, setting this to 1 (opaque resize on) or 0
  (opaque resize off), and by recompiling, installing, etc, one would get
  opaque resize back.

  A more elegant way would be to add OpaqueResize to the Scr structure, add
  code to parse it out of the fvwmrc file, setting on the fly, etc, but
  this would imply changing a few more files, recompiling everything (as
  opposed to just resize.c with the patch above) and it will all go away
  with TGSFRW (The Great Style Flag Re-Write.)

Glad to see you got things working!
  
(I thought the following might be of interest...)

David, if you do not want to compile some of the modules or even all
of them (I do this many times), just edit the top level Imakefile.
You can delete a lot of stuff in the toplevel Imakefile before
compiling.

I usually change the following:

----cut here ----
BUILDSUBDIRS = \
          libs \
          fvwm \
          modules/FvwmAudio \
          modules/FvwmAuto \
          modules/FvwmBacker \
          modules/FvwmButtons \
          modules/FvwmCpp \
          modules/FvwmDebug \
          modules/FvwmForm \
          modules/FvwmIconBox \
          modules/FvwmIconMan \
          modules/FvwmIdent \
          modules/FvwmM4 \
          modules/FvwmPager \
          modules/FvwmSave \
          modules/FvwmSaveDesk \
          modules/FvwmScroll \
          modules/FvwmTalk \
          modules/FvwmWinList

SAMPLESUBDIRS = \
          utils \
          sample.fvwmrc

#if HasXpm
XPMSUBDIRS = xpmroot modules/FvwmBanner
#endif

SUBDIRS = $(BUILDSUBDIRS) $(XPMSUBDIRS) $(SAMPLESUBDIRS)
----cut here ----

to something similar to

----cut here ----
BUILDSUBDIRS = \
          libs \
          fvwm \
          modules/FvwmM4 \
          modules/FvwmPager

SUBDIRS = $(BUILDSUBDIRS) $(XPMSUBDIRS) $(SAMPLESUBDIRS)
----cut here ----

Just make sure the backslashes are correct then you will be fine and
done quicker.

Sincerely,

I am trying to set up some generic styles so I can use UseStyle for
many windows.  It seems to work except for Color.

For example:

Style "Highlight"      Color Black/Red

Style "Window"          UseStyle Highlight

Window will come out with color Black/gray, even though I don't use 
Black/Gray anywhere.  If I change it to:

Style "Window"          Color Black/Red

it works fine.  I believe there is a bug (or undocumented feature) in
UseStyle.

If it's broke, ditch it. I'm curious -- does UseStyle provide any new
functionality that isn't already provided by FvwmCPP/FvwmM4? Seems like

#define HIGHLIGHT "Color Black/Red"
Style "Window" HIGHLIGHT

would be effectively the same. And it's more powerful, since you can
customize the setting based on the display, e.g.,

/* Window and icon fonts */

#if Y_RESOLUTION >= 3700
#define WINDOWFONT	-adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#define ICONFONT	-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#else
#define WINDOWFONT	-adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#define ICONFONT	-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#endif

WindowFont	WINDOWFONT
IconFont	ICONFONT

At 16 and 32 bits per pixel I doubt *VERY* much that I am running out of
colors.

Since neither netscape, gimp nor xv have any problems finding thousands
or millions of colors, I must assume that the problem is with FvwmForms.

yipes!  I clearly didn't read the original message closely enough.
I'm stuck with 8bit and that was definitely my problem.

...and this time I didn't see it on the ToDo list.  That doesn't mean
I won't make a fool out of myself if this feature is already there, or
I just plain missed it. :-)

Move HighlightColor into a Style so I can have different highlight
colors for different windows.  If I remember correctly you could do
this for 1.24r.  I guess this is part of the GSR?

After using FlipFocus for a while, I discovered that it didn't work exactly
as I would like.  So I modified it, and I like the new behavior much
better.

Apply the new patch below, and tell me if you like the new version better
too.

The first patch will convert directly from fvwm 2.0.42, the second one will
convert the old FlipFocus to the new one.

I hope that makes sense.

Would it be feasible to have an "invisible" button style that could be
used to place a button "over" a swallowed app allowing you to map
mouse button actions to the swallowed app?  This way you could swallow
xload and upon mouse 1 click start a xterm with top running in it.
This is the pretty much the only feature that I like in HP View :)
and would like to see it in fvwm.

I know this functionality is available in tkgoodstuff, but I would
prefer just using FvwmButtons.

any comments?

sincerely happy fvwm user :)

It goes back to late 1995 -> today, but at least it's a start.  I ran across
it accidently when I was searching for myself (come on, I know you all do
that from time to time) via Lycos.

Take a look at the FVWM homepage, whose URL is appended to each message.  
There is a link on that page to the archives, and there's even a nifty little

I would like to see more functions like HighlightColor. For example,
StickyColor, CirculateSkipColor, etc.  These colors would be the defaults
if the corresponding style was in affect for a window, and
could be overridden with an explicit call to Color.

You could then tell at a glance what window will be hit with Next/Perv, 
which ones will move when you change pages/desks, etc.

Actually, I'd like to see these all go into Styles, with the removal
of a separate HighlightColor function.  Isn't Style "*" supposed to be
the default?

Here's a little module I threw together so I could have menus which
were created on the fly, based on the contents of a directory.
Sort of like MacIntosh's application menus.

I like being able to throw a new program into my bin directory and 
having it automatically appear in fvwm's menus.
All it takes is one entry in .fvwm2rc:
+     "Applications"     Module AppMenu {directory}
where {directory} defaults to $HOME/bin, but can be anything you want.


Here are a few examples from my ~/bin directory:

Filename:	TkDesk%desk.xpm%
Contents:	exec tkdesk

Filename:	Calculator%calc.xpm%
Contents:	exec xcalc

Filename:	xcdplayer
Contains the actual executable

Filename:	Games%dir_opened.xpm%
is a symbolic link to /usr/local/games


Someday I would like it to act like a popup menu, but getting
a module to do that would require changing the base code.
Perhaps I'll look into that later...


Let me know if anyone finds this useful.

Maybe it would be possible if the applications view
of the colors was an virtual one ?? ie having the x server
do the translation of colorname to rgb values on the fly while
outputting to the screen ?? That would allow the window managers
to manage colormapping as they see fit. Would of course
require an rewrite of the protocol...

I presume that libXpm.so.4.8 is the old Xpm library ??
In that case i think you just deleted libXpm.so.4.8 ...

Or maybe the crashing fvwm is the new one ?? In that
case I think you missed adding a -R argument for the
directory containing libXpm.so ??
Where is your libXpm.so libraries ??

Remember this is solaris to the run-time linker searches for
the libraries in places specified at program compilation...

Dear All

Config: DEC OSF1 3.0b / FVWM 2.0.42

I have a simple start up function thus:

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+       I Exec xsetroot -solid "#266294"
+       I Module FvwmButtons
+       I exec rxvt -ls
+       I exec netscape -ncols 64

This works fine if its in my .fvwm2rc file.

However, if I put this in a file called .fvwm2cpp, and make my
.fvwm2rc file:

FvwmCpp /home/ian/.fvwm2cpp

Then on a restart (or login/logout), my InitFunction doesn't
operate.  All my Menu/Button/Mouse bindings are OK.  The
RestartFunction doesn't work either.

If I use the -debug option to FvwmCpp, and copy the resulting
processed file from /tmp/fvwmXXXXXX to my .fvwm2rc file and
restart - everything is fine again with my Init/Restart functions!

Any ideas on how to fix this ??

Thanks

Ian

Hi all,
    I was just scanning through the TODO list on the Homepage when I
noticed the following line:
    - Find out why closing windows fills the area w/ the border color

I must say I haven't got a huge knowledge of how window managers work,
but I could guess that because the frame is a parent of the client
window, then when the client window is destroyed it effectively causes
an Expose of the middle area of the Frame window.  Of course, the X
server knows what background colour the window should be so it paints
that in automatically, and then I expect it sends FVWM an Expose event
to see if FVWM wants to draw anything in the middle area of the Frame
window.  Hence, even if FVWM ignores the Expose event (which it probably
does), the center area of the Frame window will still be redrawn by
the X server first.

I guess the only way to stop this is to trap the fact that the client
window is going to be destroyed or hidden and then apply the same
function to the Frame first and then the client window.

    Just a thought...
       Jonathan.

Hi there, 

I used to have the following lines in .fvwm2rc:

,-----
| Style "FvwmWindows" NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, BorderWidth 0, WindowListSkip
| Style "FvwmWindows" CirculateSkip
| Style "Fvwm*"       UseStyle FvwmWindows
`-----

FvwmPager and another Fvwm window showed up in FvwmIconMan.  I changed
the lines like so:

,-----
| Style "FvwmWindows" NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, BorderWidth 0, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip
| Style "Fvwm*"       UseStyle FvwmWindows
`-----

FvwmPager and the other Fvwm window disappeared from FvwmIconMan after
a restart.

What's the story?  Any limitations with UseStyle?

Great work with Fvwm, Chuck and Rob!

I don't know if anyone cares or not, but I have placed a screen shot of
my desk from work on my homepage. You will find the URL in my signature
below.

You can see a picture of the Pager using the FvwmPagerDeskColor Hack I
wrote that is in 2.0.42.

I found this bug about 2 years ago, and tried to fix, but no helps...

***

* What's a bug ?

	*Sometimes* (not always) in certain situation, all keyboard
	shortcut losts its effect.

* How to reproduce ?

	1) Supporse a desktop, which has some 'Sticky' window and
	   only ONE 'Slippary' window. Keyboard focus policy is
	   'MouseFocus' in all windows.

	2) Give a focus to the 'Slippary' window by moving pointer.

	3) Iconify the 'Slippary' window by keyboard shortcut or
	   clicking titlebar/titlebutton (bind to 'Iconify' is
	   needed).

	4) And keyboard shortcut may (not always) losts...

* How to recover such a situation ?

	Show a popup menu by clicking a mouse button, or give a focus
	to another ('Sticky') windows by moving a pointer.

***

Anybody has ever seen such a situation ?

chuck_hines> Perhaps something like the following would work better:
chuck_hines>   Goto [Page x y | RelativePage dx dy] [Desk z | RelativeDesk dz]
chuck_hines> Verbose, but no suprises.

I support this idea. To proof this fact, I wrote a code.

***

Here is an implementation of 'Desk' for 2.0.42, to discuss what's the
cool specification of 'Goto'.

Following is the BUGS list of this patch:

	* It USES the features of old functions.
	* It does NOT remove 'GotoPage' and/or 'Desk'.
	* It does NOT update manual.
	* It's NOT THE SAME SYNTAX of Chuck's idea, i.e.,
		Goto [Page x y |
		      RelativePage dx dy |
		      Desk z |
		      RelativeDesk dz]*
	* It's DIRTY. I've never write such a code :-p, and
	* Author is very SLEEPY (See Data: field of this mail).

I hope that anybody writes more cool implementation :-) It should be
avoided that this code is included to the next release of fvwm :-)

I sent this question 2 weeks ago and I don't believe I got any replies
back.

## Is the "timing bug" fixed with 2.0.42.

## I mean the one that gets menus hidding behind windows when you select them ?
## I'm using 2.0.41 now.


Also, while not an fvwm question ... I'm looking for an xterm that would
have a transparent background . Can this be done with a specific color
or does it require an xterm replacement of some sort.

Thanks !

} I use a 3x3 desktop and until very recently only used a single desk.
} However, on a recent project, I found I was opening more and more
} windows.  I like to keep the number of windows per page as small as
} possible to avoid overlap.

Couldn't agree more.  I use a combination of several 2x2 desktops (with
alt+arrow keys mapped to change pages), StartsOnDesk styles to place my
apps on the appropriate desks, and both StickyIcons and StubbornIcons
(yup, 1.24r) so that any app I've iconified follows me around.  A quick
double-click takes me back to both the app and its desk.  This is very
handy with, for example, Z-Mail, which changes the color of the icon
when new mail arrives.  (Since I can selectively iconify, the icons
take up less space than leaving FvwmWinList on the page, and they're
much faster to use than waiting for a transient FvwmWinList to pop up.)

Still lobbying for StubbornIcons, even as a global rather than a Style,
in 2.0.* ...

hi,
we need desperately your help !
After compiling the fvwm2 with gcc 2.7.2 we had startup problems.
We copiled it with the -g option on a HP-9000/735 running HP-UX 9.0.7.
The Makefile.std has been used to coplile the files in FvwmConfig.
After starting the fvwm2 the following messages have been
written to stdout:

 * -DMODALITY_IS_EVIL
 *
 * Totally disables motif applications ability to have modal dialogs.
 * Use with care.
 *
 *
-DNO_SAVEUNDERS 
 *
 * Tells the WM not to request save unders for pop-up
 * menus. A quick test using monochrome X11 shows that save
 * unders cost about 4Kbytes RAM, but saves a lot of
 * window redraws if you have windows that take a while
 * to refresh. For xcolor, I assume the cost is more like
 * 4Kbytesx8 = 32kbytes (256 color).
 *
 *
 *     -DSHAPE
 *
 * If you want the Shaped window extensions.
 * Shaped window extensions seem to increase the window managers RSS
 * by about 60 Kbytes. They provide for leaving a title-bar on the window
 * without a border.
 * If you don't use shaped window extension, you can either make your 
 * shaped windows undecorated, or live with a border and backdrop around
 * all your shaped windows (oclock, xeyes)
 *
 * If you normally use a shaped window (xeyes or oclock), you might as
 * well compile this extension in, since the memory cost is  minimal in
 * this case (The shaped window shared libs will be loaded anyway). If you
 * don't normally use a shaped window, you have to decide for yourself
 *
 *
 *     -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS
 *
 * Allows use of the Pixmaps on Fvwm buttons using an
 * extended version of ButtonStyle.  This option is only 
 * valid if Xpm support is compiled in (see above).
 * Compatibility with the old definition format is preserved, 
 * while introducing the following format:
 *
 * ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap btn1.xpm
 * ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap btn1.xpm btn1a.xpm
 *
 * where the first uses one pixmap for both states and the second
 * uses one for each state (first is "up").

Most likely cause, you have no $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

Well, this is where I'm a little unsure.  As I said, my knowledge of window
manager level X code is not wonderful, but I thought that a window manager could
get notification of all X calls...
...searching for an X manual to grab off a colleague...
Aha !  Here it is... SubstructureRedirectMask... Oh. No.  Perhaps not...
SubstructureRedirectMask only gets MapRequest, not Unmap...

Oh, well I suppose you're right then, no it doesn't work.

Anyway, I think my explanation of why the frame window gets cleared to the
background colour of the frame still stands.  Only, I guess we've just proved
that you cannot do anything about it, so presumably it could be taken off the
TODO list.  (I'm trying to save you some work here Chuck  ;-)

  Sorry for the false alarm,
    Jonathan.

It's on the list, because other window managers don't  do this.  There
has to be a reason and a cure.

It seems to me that this problem would be caused by the order the windows
are closed.  What I mean is, the app window is closed, then the border
window.  

Wouldn't it work to remove the borders, then close the window?

Here is a patch that eliminates the blink of border color when a window
is closed.

This is not the most elegant solution, but it shows that the problem is
the order in which the window is closed.

Ahh, finally some progress.

I'm not  sure we are  on  the same  track,  I never noticed  any frame
blinking.   What I see is the  frame filling with the "unhilite color"
during window takedown.

I tried this:

Around line 1900 in builtins.c, I removed this line:

 XUnmapWindow(dpy,w);

Therefore  only unmapping the frame.   I think it automatically unmaps
the window inside.  This seems to fix the frame filling problem during
iconify, but I still  see the frame  fill when I exit  an application.
(For example typing "q" in an xv window.)

Any testing has to be done with the cpu very busy.

It does seem to speed up iconifying also.

Sorry, I am going a little too fast.  What I also did is remove
these lines from icons.c:

around line 787.

	  XSelectInput(dpy, t->w, eventMask & ~StructureNotifyMask);
          XUnmapWindow(dpy, t->w);

(Still just unmapping the frame.)

Yup, same track.  On my computer it appears as a blink of the unhilight color.

I believe that the problem is with the application closing itself down and
unmapping itself.  The proper fix would be to redo the unmapping so that
whenever a window is unmapped, it unmaps the frame first.  I am not entirly
certain how to do this when the application kills itself (q in xv).
It might be possible to do this by modifying the windows event mask.

That is very difficult for me to do, I have a very fact computer. :)

Ah yes, you can do that, and it's reasonably elegant, but it doesn't solve the
problem entirely.
In fact, I was looking at the problem from the other point of view where the
application destroys its own window, leaving the frame window behind.  How does
the window manager trap that before it happens.  I now believe it cannot.  I
think it can only wait until it gets the UnmapNotify or the DestroyNotify
through the SubstructureRedirectMask.

  Cheers,
    Jonathan.

Yes, but then, when the app queries its display state, it will get Mapped (I
think), rather than Unmapped.  I think we need to unmap the frame first, and
then unmap the application window.  Of course, the second unmap doesn't have any
visual effect, it just keeps the application sweet.

Most of you probably know this already, but I thought I'd mention it
anyway, as I haven't really seen any references to it.

I noticed the other day that when you run fvwm 2.0.42 under Xnest, at
least on my machine (slow Tseng 4k video card), it runs rather
sluggishly.  I believe an older one like 2.0.38 runs a bit better.
In any case, if anyone out there feels like optimizing fvwm, or I
believe some people were trying to debug some "undocumented"
blinking... This might be a way to see it more easily.  And for those
poor soles who have insanely fast hardware, running a couple nested
Xnest's should be able to slow X down to human readable speeds. :-)  I
believe, however, Xnest is an X11R6 program, and I have no idea if
there is an R5 version (or if that's even feasable).

Just a thought,
Danny Sung

If you're really serious about observing the events in proper order, try running
fvwm in synchronous mode, try using strace -p<pid>, and try MEM=4M or something
like that on the command line of the kernel, or try any combination of the above.

What a bunch of nice suprises!  You guys have done a wonderful job with it and
all the neat "modules" for it.

Keep up the great work!!

I am having problems getting fvwm-2.0.42 to work. I untar the distribution,
check the Fvwm.tmpl without doing modifications, type MakeMakefiles and make
and it compiles fine (only thing it complains about is not finding
readline/readline.h while doing makedep in FvwmConsole directory). Then I do
'make install'. Then, when I try to start X and the new fvwm2 with my own
.fvwm2rc, it loads a while and then shuts down X and returns to console with
no error message. With the supplied system.fvwm2rc it doesn't do this. I
have found the reason: Fvwm works and doesn't crash if the config file 
doesn't
use any of the functions that handle with XPM's. FvwmButtons doesn't work
either (because of the same reason obviously). My system is Linux 1.3.66
and XFree v3.1.2 and I _do_ have /usr/X11/lib/libXpm.so.4.7

Is my libXpm too old or why doesn't it work?
fvwm 2.0.41 worked 100% fine!

Well, I've been trying to customize the iconbox, and found a couple 
things that don't seem to be working.

they are:
*FvwmIconBoxSBWidth     2
*FvwmIconBoxFrameWidth  2 2


No matter what I do to change these, nothing in the IconBox seems to 
change.  =(   Is this a known problem and is there a fix?  *grin*


This is 2.0.42 running on Linux kernel 1.2.13 and Accelerated-X 1.3
(any other info needed?  =)

or did you mean Ctrl-Alt-Del, that's for wheemsy PC's,
I'm on a sun, and the tiny little thing crashes suffers a lot,
when I press Shift-L1-A

It's just a nice thing to be able to kill the session really fast.
And a standard Unix user always tries  Ctrl-d and then Ctrl-c.

I think Barry actually meant Alt-Ctrl-Backspace, which I believe is a
standard keystroke to kill the X server, unless the X server is
started w/ a parameter telling it otherwise (-T, I believe).

Unless of course I'm wrong and this isn't a standard...  I know this
works under AIX (although I don't often use it).  I'll have to try it
under Linux when I get home.

That's fine for closing an xterm, since the shells recognize that.
You can always bind some key sequence to exit fvwm, but I don't want
to try and keep track of what programs are running and try to decide
that the user really wants to bail out of fvwm.

I am the author of MFM - Motif File Manager.  It is a NeXTSTEP look-and-feel
filemanager for Unix.  I would like to collaborate with the current maintainers
of fvwm to integrate MFM with FVWM to create an easy to use public domain
desktop.  If you would be interested in such a proposition, please contact me.
 If you would like to examine MFM, see:

	ftp.x.org:contrib/desktop_managers/

Some of the things others have suggested to me is:

  - drag-n-drop to/from GoodStuff Applications Launcher
  - dynamic main window menu's
  - GUI interface to build .fvwmrc files

Has anyone had any trouble in running or compiling netaudio with FVWM
release 42?  I cannot get it to work, and do not know where the problem
is.  It compiles fine, but when ausun is run, it locks the /dev/audio,
but never plays any audio bites.

I don't know if anyone's seen this one yet because i don't subscribe to
the list.  THe thing is that Fvwm 2 really doesn't like you to set the
style for any window to NoButton 1 (any other button it can live
without, but it really hates to turn off button 1). Specifically, this
was on a 486 intel machine running linux. (1.2.3 .. i'm ashamed, but i
don't have the disk space to compile a new kernel) I really noticed the
problem when i tried to spawn FvwmButtons and FvwmPager (fvwm pager was
set to NoButton 1) in the init function, at that point the focus of any
internal command seemed to be stuck on fvwmpager... (can use FvwmTalk to
test this) so that when i would type, say, iconify, it would iconify the
pager, instead of giving you a cursor to select the item that it's
supposed to perform the operation on.  The real trouble is, not only did
this mess up all of the menu options that i had in the fvwmbuttons
config that called to internal commands, but when i selected something
like "delete" it would exit the window manager :) oh, and it screwed the
menu placement also, basically made everything a big mess.  If anyone
wants to duplicate this and needs more info or a copy of my .fvwmrc or
whatever, ask for it.  so far this is the only major thing i've found
wrong, and i thought it was worth reporting, sorry again if somebody
allready has.

Is there an easy way to get the SmartPlacement option to not place
new windows over Icons or IconBoxes?  I thought this was possible,
but could not find mention of it in the manual page.

I like the pager, but I don't use desks.  How might I get it so that I 
don't have the annoying "Desk 0" at the top of the window?  I looked as 
close as I could, but didn't find a config for it.. would I have to hack 
the source?

Try: "*FvwmPagerFont none". It works for me.

I'd like to keep my background on restart.
Any reason, why fvwm2 sets the background to black and then to this grey
pattern? 

It happens after fvwm starts up, and I don't think it's from a system
startup script. (searched through all of them, I think.)

Usually a user sets his own background on startup, so this flickering is
annoying. 

We could have a default in the initfunction, and maybe even in the 
"missing .fvwm2rc defaults" section, but if a .fvwm2rc exits I'd leave it
to the user.

I have one of these windows95 enhanced keyboards, and would like to
utilize the three extra buttons. xev gives me L-meta, R-meta and
menu. How do I add these extra modifiers to fvwm, so I can bind a
function to them?

What I think is happening is that the X-server is painting the frame
with it's background colour when the client window disappears.  I haven't
looked at the window frame creation code but I suspect from these symptoms that
it is given a background colour in order to speed up refreshes (only the
non-background bits need to be drawn by fvwm).

Since fvwm can't stop clients unmapping themselves and can't stop the server
filling in the background colour when the frame centre is exposed the only
way to stop the flashing is to make sure the area under the client window
has a background of none.

There are two ways to do this, either don't set the frame background and live
with the extra drawing overhead or create an intermediate window with no
background under the client but above the frame.

When there is no background for the server to paint the screen will be left
with the contents of the client window until the frame is unmapped.

Hope this helps,
Tim Phipps.

Nifty.  Yes, I think this might just work.  I guess the only disadvantage is if
the window manager or comms lock up straight after the client exits, in which
case, the user will be left with a client that looks OK, but doesn't respond at
all.  But, then that's no bad thing really, because whatever you do to it, it
won't cause any problems.

My vote would be for the extra window.  I know that adds a lot of extra windows
(one per client window), but we are not trying to solve the problem for fast
machines.  The situation that needs resolving is the one where the
machine/network is slow, in which case we NEED the background colour to minimise
repainting work, but we also need the extra window with background colour none
to avoid the flash.

Well done !  Nice bit of round-about thinking.

  Cheers,

GNU Emacs 19.30.99.2 (sparc-sun-solaris2.3, X toolkit)

I create a new frame with

(make-frame '((width . 100) (top . 0) (left . 490)))

This is partially obscured by two sticky, staysontop xclocks (one
analog, one digital).

I use emacs' other-frame to go to the newly created frame. the cursor
warps to the frame's upper right corner, which is obscured by the
xclocks, but the frame still gets focus. I use focusfollowsmouse.

I iconify the frame, using the keyboard. The frame is iconified, but
none of the keystrokes to warp cursor/transfer focus work until I've
moved the mouse cursor out of the xclock windows.

Remove the following line from InitFunction and RestartFunction.

+                         "I" exec xsetroot -mod 2 2 -fg \#554055 -bg \#705070

It is in the default .fvwm2rc.  If you copied it over, you probably have
this line.

sorry I forgot to mention:

#	"I"	Exec	exec xsetroot -solid "#266294" &

so I don't have any xsetroot alive.



ok, I waded through the xv docs again, and now added +noresetroot !!!!
That was the b/w shaded background which was displayed for a short time.

I have a Microsoft Natural Keyboard on both my SparcStation and
Solaris x86 systems.  Using xmodmap, I map CapsLock->Control_L and
Control_L->CapsLock.  Then I map Alt_L->Meta_L and Alt_R->Meta_R,
setting the mod 1 bit on both.

Finally, I map Control_R->Hyper_R and set mod 5.  This lets me reserve
the right control key for fvwm only chords without conflicting my
existing application (Emacs and Grail mostly) chord combinations.
This works great, and I include my xmodmap file below (although your
keycodes may differ).

Once downside.  ON the SparcSTation, neither the left and right
Windows keys, nor the Menu key generate keysyms so they are basically
non-existant to X (anybody know a way to change that?).  What's odd is
that the same keyboard on my x86 system (an Intel based P133 runnning
Solaris 2.5), those keys *do* generate keysyms!

I'm not entirely sure I understand your question. Do you want some
action taken when these keys are pressed alone, or when some other
keys are pressed in combination with them?

In the latter case, you can do something along the lines of what I've
done: Assign one of X's little used modifiers to the keys, and use
that modifier's number in .fvwm2rc. In your .xsession (or anywhere
else that this will always be done when it needs to) do something
along the lines of:

case $DISPLAYTYPE in
  .
  .
<The displaytype in question>)
        xmodmap - <<-END
		add mod3 =3D L-meta
		add Mod4 =3D R-meta
		add mod5 =3D menu
                END
        ;;

(If these keys by default have other modifiers, you may need to use
clear/remove first. Check the xmodmap man page.)

Now, in your .fvwm2rc you can do things like:

Key i           A       3       Iconify
Key r           A       3       Refresh

etc.

Maybe I misunderstand what you're saying, but if the problem is that
the keys have keycodes but no keysyms, that can be solved using xmodmap:

   keycode x =3D Meta_L
   keycode y =3D Meta_R
   keycode z =3D Meta_R

Has anyone ever discovered how to get the OpenWin mailtool to not open
individual letters as Icons?  At random times when I open letters to read,
they get opened as Iconic windows, and I have to go searching for them.
Also, if the mail has an attachment, FVWM does not seem to be able to
recognize this and modify the window to contain the attachment window,
unless I try to resize the letter window -- in which case the
attachments "suddenly" appear.

A common complaint, I had an attempted patch from David Taylor for this problem, but
it didn't work. He's gonna try another patch when he gets access to a Sun in a few
weeks time. I hope he doesn't mind he promising this on his behalf! :-)

The problem seems to be this:
The first mail to be received by mailtool (assuming you keep inbox empty) is
fine, it opens okay, get rid of it.
The next mail to arrive will be opened as an icon.
This will continue until you start mailtool again.

I have no fix for this. I'd *love* one, mail is after all a very important part of
many people's working life.

There are a few bugs with Sun deskset tools, most are problematic rather than trivial.
Eg Some filemananger menus go behind the filemanager and stay there. The openlook
patch for hints didn't help any. I now tend to just avoid these tools!

If anyone has a solution to this please let me know!

Hi,

I am new to this list, and I have checked the to do list, as well
as some of the archives.  One thing about the pager that I like the
capability of moving windows out of the pager onto the desktop.  However,
I have also used the pager from olvwm (open look virtual window manager),
which has this capability, but also the apability to move windows from
the desktop into the pager.  At this point, I really don't know too much
about X programming, so tere is no way that I am able to do this.  I just
thought I would mention it as a possible future feature.

This is a very nice feature of olvwm, another feature of the OLIT set 
that I'd like to see put into fvwm is a Menu feature.

Anyone that knows OL has seen this as the "DEFAULT" option under menu 
building.

In explanation:  DEFAULT does quite a few things. 
For 1> if you go to select a menu with a default item and release the 
mouse button, the default is activated just like you had actually moused 
into the menu and selected it.
2> when the menu does come into view (off of another menu) it is aligned 
such that the default selection lines up with the menu activator
3> if you mouse out of the menu (and it's still there) and mouse back 
into it, the mouse warps to the default  (I may remember this part wrong 
;)

Any other nice features to think of?

PS --  thanks for the help with the pager, after admittedly quite a bit 
of time fuzzling with things, I customized my desktop to my satisfaction  
=)  It's real purty too  ;)

In hopes of preventing a lot of replies here. . . . . 

This is a much-dicussed feature, and although I do not use olwm (or
vaiants sp) I can see the use of this.

Once Chuck (or whoever, I can't remember) finishes the recoding to allow
moduiles to better communicate with fvwm, I am going to look into this
(if someone doesn't beat me to it, or classes don't beat me into the
ground).

In short. . . 

	#1	Can't do it now.
	#2	Don't think it can happen under current Module design
	#3	Many people want it.
	#4	I want to start playing with the pager code.

-Alan

Fvwm folks: if you sort past the tkgoodstuff comments, there's a real
fvwm problem here . . .

Good!  I finally decided to do it the normal way.  The GUI
configuration is under further development.  I have hacked up a
hierarchical list widget which will be used for editing the main
"configuration", the menus, and other stuff (stay tuned).

I don't have such plans (dunno about Eric Kahler).  In fact I prefer
the pager without the tiny windows.  If I really want to see a page, I
can go there and not have to squint.  One can move windows from page
to page by dragging (with button 2) from the tkgoodstuff WindowList to
the Pager window.  What exactly do you miss about having tiny windows?

Rats!  Me too (and I've posted this problem to the fvwm list before),
but I had hoped it was idiosyncratic to my setup.  I include (for the
fvwm folks) the basic module interface code below.  Why might the
death of a module make fvwm eat up lotsa cpu?

Right; I'll make the standard error dialog not a killer after the main
window gets posted and (if the main window never gets posted and
"dismiss" doesn't exit, tkgoodstuff just sits in your process list
until you kill it).

Thanks for your input!

The user is also allowed to change the default menu selection on the fly
by putting the mouse over a selection and hitting the control key (maybe
the key changes).

nas is different than rplay.  Since the two are so similar it was recently
suggested someone allow FvwmAudio to be compiled with either/both.

However we haven't had any volunteers yet.

So, if you want the gratitude of a multitude of people, perhaps you could
be the above the mentioned volunteer.

But, if you don't want to be, the easy solution is to get the rplayd package
and use rplayd instead of ausun.

I was clearing out some of my old saved messages, and came across
something like, "it won't be too hard to impliment in the next version
(pre-x.42)" in reply to the request to allow the button 1 to be the pixmap
of the icon already assigned by the style lists.  This doesn't seem to
have been implimented, and I was wondering if it had been dropped or
forgotten.  I remember there was discussion about active scaling of the
pixmap, so it would fit as a button without having to create a new file,
and having to tell fvwm about two separate styles, one for the icon, and
one for the button.

Does anyone have a script that will convert menus in olwm files to fvwm2
format? This would be very useful for my work mates who stubornly insist
on using olwm, because it is easier! 8-(

I think that an easy conversion script would help. also how about twn
and mwm scripts??

All-

"Rewiring" the menus for olwm, et al. shouldn't be too difficult, but the
problem is that there is so much more in the fvwmrc file than will ever be in
the .openwin* files.  If someone doesn't beat me to it, I'll try to make a
short menu converter over the weekend.  I have finals coming up, so no promises

I'm only interested in the menus. Everything else should be excluded,
and menu stuff can go into a separate file, for reading by the .fvwmrc
file.
I split my files up anyway, so this would be no problem for me

Sure.  I was the person who submitted the UseStyle patch.  I thought
that I had a good idea when I searched for the style structure with
the same name as the style we wanted to mimic....

 nptr = Scr.TheList;
 while(nptr && mystrncasecmp(restofline,nptr->name,len) )
   nptr = nptr->next;
 if (nptr&& !mystrncasecmp(restofline,nptr->name,len))
 {
   on_flags      = nptr->on_flags;
   off_flags     = nptr->off_flags;
   icon_name     = nptr->value;
[...]

It looks like, to me, that the structure is copied entirely..
Being my 'initiate' patch to fvwm, I would more than bet there
are things wrong with it...

Perhaps should the char*'s be strdup'ed? .. of course!
doit!  I guess this should be fixed...sorry if these have
caused any problems...

564c564
<               icon_name     = strdup(nptr->value);
---
>               icon_name     = nptr->value;
568,569c568,569
<               forecolor     = strdup(nptr->ForeColor);
<               backcolor     = strdup(nptr->BackColor);
---
>               forecolor     = nptr->ForeColor;
>               backcolor     = nptr->BackColor = backcolor;

See if this helps things out abit...

Also, to address the question at hand...does m4/cpp preprocessing
already provide the same functionality as UseStyle.

To some degree.  However, you can't use an m4 macro in FvwmTalk,
and an m4 macro isn't quite the same as copying the binary
contents of a structure.  An m4 macro couldn't do, for
example:

Style "a" Color Black/Red
Style "b" UseStyle a
Style "a" NoTitle

To jump the fence, so to speak....however....UseStyle was
originally intended to be 'macro-like' and what better way
to do something 'like' a macro than to use a macro itself?

What does anybody else think?

I seem to remember a thread a while back about fvwm (and a couple of other
window managers) tickling bugs in various X programs such that they segfault'ed
when bringing up new windows (sometimes).  Well, I've found such a program
(Simeon, by Esys).  It's happy as a clam under twm/mwm, but fvwm just crashes
it (for instance, bringing up the Compose window *always* kills it off).

Does anybody remember if there was a fix (either for the offending program, or
for fvwm)?  If it helps at all,  Simeon is really just a giant Tk/Tcl program
that has had tcltoc run on it (although Esys probably wouldn't admit it).  For
some reason, I've got vague recollections of ICCM-compliance being mentioned in
relation to this thread.

don't apply that patch I just submitted.  Somehow it causes fvwm to
seg fault for me....when I am in an environment where I can run
gdb on the window manager, I will try to see why it does...unless
someone on the list wants to point out the obvious mistake I
should be seeing..

As far as I can tell, twm doesn't do this either.  I guess I need to get
on slower machines to make certain, but it appears to be somewhat of a quite
funny coincidence: twm, from which fvwm arose, exibits a behavior we wish
fvwm had.  I find that humorous.

Could someone verify this for me?

Hi,

WIBNI one could dynamically change the title of a window and an icon?
For example, Ghostview always has the same window and icon title,
consisting of the string ``Ghostview, version 1.5''.  This is less
than ideal for choosing the right window if one has several
invocations of Ghostview running...

Can this be done with a module?  Has anybody written such a module?

tia,
kai

strdup(NULL) chokes at least on Linux, whereas on HP-UX it works
like strdup("").

Something like 
	#define strdup_safe(s) ((s)?strdup(s):NULL)
should do what you inteded.

I thought mwm did it, but I can't check because I had mwm in my previous job,
but not anymore.  Besides, (as many people have "complained" ;-) my workstation
is too fast to have the problem, even if I did have mwm.

I'm not sure why it it seg faulting, but I think I see the reason that
the color is/was not working.

>     backcolor = nptr->BackColor = backcolor;

This is the same as:

	nptr->BackColor = backcolor;
	backcolor=backcolor;

The net affect is that the background color does not change to the new style.
It should also have the affect of changing the color of the original window.
Just a momemt, let me check...

Well, almost.  The affect is that both windows end up with a grey background
color. That certainly answers that!  Now, lets see if changing it to

	backcolor = nptr->BackColor; 

works...

Yup, that fixes it!

The patch to fix it follows.

I noticed this when I was glancing at the sources.  I can't believe

I am not sure if this is a problem with Netscape, fvwm, or fvwm95 but 
I thought I would pass it along.

Using Linux 1.2.13, fvwm95-2.0.41e, Netscape Atlas 3.03b

If I have several netscape windows open (mail, news and a browser) and 
exit netscape it also deletes the fvwm95 taskbar and I must restart it 
from the menu. If I have only a single netscape window open, exiting 
does NOT kill the taskbar.

I think UseStyle is useful, but it must accept quoted styles (I am
remembering that it didn't, but maybe I was doing something wrong).
If I have a style Style "The Window"  I should be able to UseStyle
"The Window".

But I think it is pretty useful, especially for people who don't use
macro preprocessors (I use m4 extensively though).  However, if there
are any problems, IMHO, I'd rather see them addressed than not.

The main problem with this is that anti-aliasing must be performed
(since you are discretely sampling the original).  Otherwise there is
always a chance that the reduced pixmap might not look anything like
the original, or at least contain artifacts.  There are different
things one can do to try and minimize aliasing effects though.

I noticed a small bug in FVWM 2.0.42  if i enable num lock.

I can no longer use the programmed F- keys, highlight in an rxvt terminal, or 
use my middle button to close windows.

I am running solaris on an UltraSparc with type 5 keyboard.

I hate to be discouraging, but...

I  drew some mini  xpms  a while ago,  and  in my opinion, the average
60x50 pixmap just isn't going to look like anything when it is reduced
to 14x14.  There just aren't enough pixels there.

I found that with    the mini xpms,   I  just had to  draw   something
different to get the idea across when the size went down that much.

Try showing  some of your  favorite icons with xv,  and then ask xv to
resize it to 14x14.  What I found is 9 times out  of 10, it was just a
blur when I was done.  And when I tried to  use that blur in xpaint, I
often found there was no way to repair it.

I don't intend to include anything like this into fvwm.  If people
want to put a mini version of the icon as button 1, they can make a
mini pixmap themselves to put there.  I don't feel it's necessary to
go through the computational effort to create a mini version on the
fly, as it will serve to only slow down & bloat fvwm, which as you all
know I'm trying hard not to let happen.

The only 'drawback' to them doing it themselves right now is that it
would have to be the same xpm for every window, since the buttons are
global and not per window.  I don't know if they ever will be window
specific either.

I don't wanna sound like I know anything (cause I dont :)... I am no
proggrammer, I just subscribed to the list because I like using fvwm and
wanna hear the latest new... 
	As for the minimizing of pixmaps, I have found that its all in the
algorithm used. No offense, but I found XV to be a really crappy resizer
when it comes to resizing anything. The best I've found (and I swear by
it) is the tool called imgworks which comes standard as an SGI tool. I
haven't resized anything that small, but I figure it would probably look
better when resized using imgworks than xv...

I don't wanna sound like I know anything (cause I dont :)... I am no
proggrammer, I just subscribed to the list because I like using fvwm and
wanna hear the latest new... 
	As for the minimizing of pixmaps, I have found that its all in the
algorithm used. No offense, but I found XV to be a really crappy resizer
when it comes to resizing anything. The best I've found (and I swear by
it) is the tool called imgworks which comes standard as an SGI tool. I
haven't resized anything that small, but I figure it would probably look
better when resized using imgworks than xv...

Its not a bug, its a feature.

Num_lock sets the Mod 3 bit (something like caps_lock).

The first line below brings up the "systems"  menu for mouse button 1,
regardless of  the num_lock setting.   The second  line brings up  the
Window-Ops menu only when num_lock is on.

Mouse 1		R   	A       Menu "Systems" Nop
Mouse 1		R   	3       Menu Window-Ops Nop

Arrange your config file accordingly.

If for some reason,  your results vary,  check out your .xmodmap file,
if  you use one.   Failing  that, get hold    of xkeycaps to see  what
num_lock is set to do.

I think that you'll find that most of these tiny icons
are drawn by graphic designers pumped up on double-lattes
and $90/hour salaries.

No amount of blurring can save you against them.

therefore, I humbly recommend against having this feature.
although it is a nice once, Macs do it too (not just
win95)....

I currently have a 2 button mouse which works adequately when outside any 
window, but I really need to be able to cut text from one window and be 
able to paste that text somewhere else.  Currently the left mouse button 
will hi-lite areas, but of course no pasting.  Does anyone have ideas on 
changes I can make to my .fvwmrc file, so that I can either use a right 
mouse button press or hold both buttons to paste while inside a window.

Thanks in advance,

This is not a property of fvwm, but one to do with your X server. Fvwm
can't help.

If you're running XFree86 on Linux or similar, you can specify
"Emulate3Buttons" in your XF86Config file. This makes left + right
clicked together pass a middle click to the application.

Hmm, come to think of it, there's no reason why a similar feature
might not live in fvwm. But then, I've not seen the input parsing
code, so I can;t comment on the easy of integration. :)

That is application dependent.  For example, if you cut something in a 
window and then use the yank command in emacs, it will come from the cut
buffer.

I can only think of 2 ways to solve your problem globally:

1) Get a 3-button mouse, or

2) Use 3-button emulation.

I use 3-button emulation, and it works well most of the time. On my
system (linux), I just uncommented the line

    Emulate3Buttons

in /etc/XF86Config.

Hope that helps,

Are you going any furthur with this? I hacked it to compile under fvwm
2.0.42 plain, It's kinda nice. I wish:

color changes as the Focus moves like WinList

indicate iconified windows like IconMan

move on click3-drag on no icon space.

resize on click1-drag

date popup for tray-time on mousehover

tray would allow mini start bar like Buttons

tray would allow mini horizontal pager

click3 on icon would offer WindowOps menu for iconed app

Here's my completely updated .fvwm2rc It's like motif with shortcut

Try it and tell me what you think!

Can it make it into the distribution?

Yes, olvwm for example supports a window-selection menu
Yes i know that AddToMenu RootMenu "" WindowList probably
is good enough.

Hi. 

	The FvwmIconBox is coming up, but it's empty.

	I'm using fvwm v 2.0.42 on Digital Unix (OSF).

	My .fvwm2 file contains:


############################################################################
# ICON Setup
#
# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature (Left Top Right Bottom)
#Style "*" IconBox -215 200 -1 -100 

# If you don't want icons for some or all windows (or all of them!)
Style "*" NoIcon

# If you want ALL icons to follow you around the desktop (Sticky)
#Style "*" StickyIcon





	My full .fvwm2 file follows.


TIA.

Aharon.

Hi there all,
I have down loaded the source for fvwm and compiled it on sevrel machines
( SunOS and linux ). on all the machine I have tried compiling the program
it compiled with no problems at all , but alas when I have run the program
it just hunged ;(.
is there a known problem that I don't know about ??
thech stuff :
1. I'm using X11R6 libs and header files.
2. I'm using gcc 2.7.2 to compile the package.
3. I have compiled xpm-3.4g as a support package to fvwm.


I really whant to use this packages....

Hi,

I'm using the 2.0.41e release of fvwm (hacked to a Win95 look) under 
XFree86, but I've got a few problems with FvwmButtons. 

First, if I set *FvwmButtonsColumns 1 it does not compute the size of the 
button-column correctly. - It seems like it adds an extra (empty) row. 
Do you have any idea about how I can avoid that ?

Secondly, if I use *FvwmButtonsRows 1, I would like to be able to 
specify the width of swallowed modules (xload and FvwmPager), but no 
matter what geometry I specify FvwmButtons apparently gets the last word 
and decides for itself what the size should be. How can I get the last 
word ?

Finally, for Fvwm 2.0.41e in general I miss the L-shaped corners. Has 
that something to do with using the Win95-hack-version, and/or can I get 
them back.

  Thanks in advance for any replies

  Rasmus

When rescaling down a pixmap by a non-integer number of times several
problems arise. For example, the geometry for the different objects in the
image changes in a differnt way depending of their location. The
inclinated and diagonal lines are distorted, circles and curves look
specially bad. Here helps the aliasing operation. Again, the aliasing
operation is simplified when rescaling an integer number of times (and
preferably a power of 2). A product of the aliasing process is an
increased number of colors of the resulting pixmap, that would use more
entries in the colormap table, so the color usage should be truncated to a
given set of colors. 

Win95 uses icons of *fixed* size 32x32, and mini-icons of 16x16. So the
rescale factor for each coordinate is always 2, is equal and symetric for
each pixel, so the resulting pixmap looks better than, for example, when
resizing a pixmap of 64x64 or 34x44 or any other odd geometry down to
14x14 or 16x14. Not to mention that the calculations for the first case
are greatly simplified. Win95 uses also a fixed set of 16 colors for icons
and mini-icons, so the aliasing operation never generates more than these
colors. 

The Win95 executable format includes anyway a mini-con resource, so if it
exists will be used (a mini-icon drawn by hand will always look better
than the resized one). Otherwise, as for the old applications, the resized
old icon is used. 

In my opinion, a compromise solution for fvwm would be sufficient. For
example, the user could specify explicitly a mini-icon for certain
application windows using the Style command, when the resize operation
generates ugly or unrecognized icons; the same option could use a
UseAppIcon modifier or something like that if the user wants to use the
application builtin icon. 

Regards,
Hector Peraza.

I have just compiled and installed fvwm95.I then started it from xinitrc, 
and all seems to go well. But, fvwm can't find the varius .xpm icons, and 
the start menu show , instead of the icons, the name of the icon that are 
in .fvwm2rc95 file.I think I have Xpm libraries installed correctly, but 
I'm not sure. Anyone can tell me the correct place for the Xpm lib and 
other files related?

Most common cause for this problem is you have no $HOME/.fvwm2rc.
Try copying the system.fvwm2rc to $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

The installation process does not install the mini-icons by default, you 
have to copy them manually to a /usr/local/icons or /usr/local/mini-icons 
directory. If you copy them to some other place you have to update the 
PixmapPath option in the .fvwm2rc95 config file.

Hope that helps,
Hector Peraza.

Thank for all. I have already patch the problem with a look at .fvwm2rc95

Is their any way (apart from writing your own

fvwm

FvwmConsole in 2.0.42 distribution has a bug (what a surprise). Even if it is
working currently for you, I suggest you apply this patch since the bug was
not allocating enough memory to variables. 

This patch should also help some of machines you could not run FvwmConsole on
before. I confirmed it ran on SunOS 4.1.4 and Sparc Solaris 2.3. 

I am currently working on a module FvwmCommand, which let user to issue fvwm
commands from shell or perl, or many other things. I have a prototype
working. It has the same code stem as in FvwmConsole, so any comments or
running confirmation will be appreciated. Although I can't answer anything
from 10th through 19th. 

Happy fvwming.

One of the items on the fvwm2-TO.DO list is:

  - Make left justified pixmaps in menus center align vertically w/
    any text displayed?

It seems that small pixmaps are already centered with larger text, but
text is not centered with larger pixmaps.
So here is a small patch to fix the vertical alignment.

Several applications that I've snarfed off the net fail unexpectedly.
Programs that run fine under HP-VUE crash, burn and die under fvwm,
(Xbrowser) or refuse to start, not even leaving an error message. (xgrok)

To date the only thing I've found in common is that they are linked
against the motif 1.2 library.  Is this a problem with fvwm, with HP's
implementation of Motif, or some obscure problem with HP?

(This is my first post here, please be nice *grin*)

I've attempted to compile fvwm for Solaris 2.4 onsite here without much 
luck (basically because Sun's imake is stuffed...)  A manual make wasn't 
much more successful.

Where can I find binaries for 2.4???

I had the same problem. You have to change the order in the .fvwm2rc file:
first specify your styles, and then include the NoIcon line. That way you
can have 2 different sets of icons: the ones that you specify before NoIcon
appear in the IconBox, and the ones you specify after NoIcon appear on the
desktop.

I have been using fvwm on HP-UX since it was in the 0.X releases, on
HP-UX 9.0X and 10.01.  I have never seen problems like you describe.

The only thing I can suggest is you try installing the X11R5/Motif patches.

this i found in a .fvwm[2]rc file somewhere:

	*FvwmButtons(4x2) - crap Swallow "console" Exec xterm -C -T -blah...
                    ^^^^^   

i guess this lets you decide how much space FvwmButtons allows for the 
swallowed stuff. so, if FvwmButtons is screwing with the resizing of your
swallowed apps, try that.

i'm using fvwm-2.0.41 and the l-shaped resize corners are present. i 
guess they were removed in Fvwm95, because they don't look like win95's.


hope this helps,

I just upgraded to 2.42 from 2.41.  Read about the changes to CFLAG,
etc and all compiled fine.  But now my buttons are bigger and the
pixmap icons inside are smaller.  I read the FAQ and the mailing list,
but I am stumped.  Included is my FvwmButtons & FvwmPager def from the
.fvwm2rc.  Any help would be nice.

Thanks

This is supposed to change the directory to root and then start a root

This is supposed to start a window for a telnet session to cmt10,

The 'UseStyle' you invented provides the concept of "inheritance",
something which can't be accomplished by a macro.  For example:

 Style "MyDefaults" Color Black/White, Title, Icon unknown.xpm, HandleWidth 3
 Style "b"          UseStyle MyDefaults, Color White/Blue
 Style "c"          UseStyle MyDefaults, Icon foobar.xpm
 Style "MySticky"   UseStyle MyDefaults, Sticky, NoTitle, HandleWidth 1

I can't seem to get rid of the titlebar in my xload with FVWM95
(haven't tried the latest clean fvwm, though).  I tried settting
the NoTitle style for "*load", "XLoad", and "xload", but non want to
get rid of the titlebar.  It does, however, remove the title bar just
fine for xbiff and xclock.

Also, concerning the Taskbar, I was wondering if there are any plans
on making it support sticking to the left or right side of the screen,
as well as autohiding.  Also, is there a way to configure the clock
that's displayed?  I'd like to be able to see the date as well as the
time (seeing seconds wouldn't hurt either).

And for my final plea for added features :-)  I know fvwm lets you cycle
through the window list one way or the other, but I personally find it
much more efficient if it were handled like a stack (what? Windows
actually made something efficient?).  The ALT-TAB'ing combination can
be rather quick, compared to having separate traverse forward and
traverse backward cominations.  The latter is especially annoying
since there isn't really a visible indication of what the window list
order is (without having to check each time).

Just some thoughts,
Danny Sung

Guys,

Have been trying to install 2.0.42 on HPUX 9.05. Either the X config
files used by imake are totally fried or we're in big trouble.
The files get through including sys/types.h and have the nerve NOT
to know what a caddr_t is! (Or couse, HP has these things in there, about
three levels deep into #if defined(_HPUX_SOURCE) et al.

Next issue: I'm closely associated with the mfm people. (mfm is a very
nice desktop manager) What kind of work do you think the two groups
should do make these two programs work more hand-in-hand?

One area which seems a "must" is the ability to make a element on the
buttonBar be a drag-and-drop receiver. In other words, if I drag a file
off of mfm and onto a WordPerfect icon on the buttonbar, it'd be nice if
WordPerfect could be 'taught' in invoke itself with the name of the file.

Another feature, which would be neat, but somewhat NeXT-ish, would be the
ability for me to grab a binary, say, "NeXs", and move it into the buttonBar,
thereby CREATING a new buttonBar icon for NeXs".

What do you folks think? We have a fine window manager and a fine desktop
manager. What makes windowing environments successful is that the two
work together in synergy. To be able to do this at the free(d)ware level
on X would be a tremendous benefit to everyone.

seems to happen only to digital appplications, like dxterm, dxconsole,
etc. Has anyone else seen this ? Any suggestions ?

TIA.

This might explain problems I've been having with Netscape 3.  For
some reason Netscape 3 can't invoke any programs -- including lpr.  I
figured this was a bug in Netscape, not fvwm.

X11R6.1, Solaris 2.5, and fvwm 2.0.42.

I have the same problem with Netscape 3, but with Linux and fvwm 1.23b.
Perhaps the problem is Netscape's, not the window manager's.

What exactly was the problem ?  Was it just doing a "make makefiles" ?

I'll append a patch to /usr/openwin/lib/config/Imake.tmp to this message that
fixes that problem.  (If it's something else, feel free to hassle me further)

jl> Where can I find binaries for 2.4???

nooo ! :)

Enjoy,
 Andrew.

(Thanks for the new Buttons, Jarl!  It's great.)

Does anyone have a working example of a (mouse) action binding in
a swallowed button: I have the following in ".fvwm2rc"

---- Start of included text -----------------------8<--- cut here -------------
*FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld) "xload1" "Exec xload -font 6x10
-background PeachPuff2 -title xload1 -hl yellow -update 5 -scale
2 -geometry -1500-1500 &", Action 'Exec "top@clove" xterm -title
top@clove -e top') 
---- End of included text -------------------------8<--- and here -------------

But the only way that I can run "top" is by pressing the return
key on the button (clicking with the mouse does nothing).

If instead I put

---- Start of included text -----------------------8<--- cut here -------------
*FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld) "xload1" "Exec xload -font 6x10
-background PeachPuff2 -title xload1 -hl yellow -update 5 -scale
2 -geometry -1500-1500 &", Action(Mouse 1) 'Exec "top@clove"
xterm -title top@clove -e top') 
---- End of included text -------------------------8<--- and here -------------

Again nothing happens with mouse clicks, but FvwmButtons crashes
with some X error when return is pressed.


Also I don't understand why the examples of UseOld in the manual
all combine it with NoKill, when "NoKill" is the default anyway,
isn't it?  Even with UseOld, is I restart fvwm2 a couple of
times, it seems to miss xload's, swisswatch regularly :-(

Hi.

John Henders in his message of 26 Sep 1995 says that he opens windows
on one page and then "I goto a different page". I assume that he means
that in his .fvwm2rc file, he causes windows to be opened on pages
other than the first. I have not figured out how to do this. Could
someone (John, are you listening ?) help me here ?

TIA.

I do not know if this is your problem, but for me (fvwm 2.0.42 on
HP-UX 9.01), netscape 3 DOES know my paths when I start it with
"/usr/local/bin/netscape", it does not find anything (including lp),
when started just as "netscape". This also happens with HP-VUE,
so it is certainly related to netscape. Strange but true!

Hope this helps,

when I called it, fvwm2 put out:

seems like it's parsed as "EXEC"cmd

checking for a [space|tab]* in between would be great !!!!

anyone of you interested in invoking commands by doubleclicking a button ?

I use the following:

*FvwmButtons (Icon xterm.xpm,	\
	Action (Mouse 1) 'Function Xec "Menu Tools" 	"exec xterm &"', \
	Action (Mouse 2) 'Function Xec "Menu WindowOps" "exec xlock -nice 0 -allowroot &"', \
	Action (Mouse 3) 'Function Xec  WindowList	Quit')
                      ^                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		which button?		SingleClick	DoubleClick
with 

AddToFunc Xec
+	"Motion"	$0
+	"Click"		$1

isn't that cool ?  Thanks for fvwm2 & FvwmButtons, Chuck & Jarl !!!!

So the button serves as root-window extension: a single click invokes the
same menu as if I had clicked in the root window. (after the motion
timeout), but doubleclicking lets me speed up xterm, xlock and 
quitting.

albrecht

PS: I tried to use the "Double-Click-Action" of the "Menu" command, but
- understandably, but annoyingly - it doesn't work, if used from
FvwmButtons:
	Action (Mouse 1) 'Menu Tools "exec xterm &"', \


PPS: don't try to use "Immediate" in Xec: it spoils the timing.
     "DoubleClick" works, but results in you having to TripleClick !!!!

Most of you probably found this one by themselves, but maybe not all and I
can't remember seeing it before, so I just thought, I'd smash in this one,
so that I'm not only complaining about bugs / asking for new features....

AddToFunc OnPage
+	"Immediate"	GoToPage $0 $1
+	"Immediate"	$2

-> voila, you've got a new command

	OnPage x y cmd

can be easily extended to also do desks:
AddToFunc OnDeskPage

+	"Immediate"	GoToPage $1 $2

Starting in 2.0.42, it is necessary to Exec multiple commands like this:

+  "cmt10" Exec /bin/sh -c 'xhost cmt10.mit.edu; color_xterm ...'

There  has been some discussion  about  whether the enclosing "/bin/sh
''" will still be necessary in 2.0.43.

As I see it, your problem is, that once an application is swallowed, 
X events are handed to it unfiltered (since it could depend on them -
imagine a swallowed pager, which can't receive any mouse event)

The only example I saw, where an action AND a swallow command was
specified, was Jarls example in the man page.
But that's a swallow with a NOP. (capture existing window, or wait 
till a window with that name appears.)
So if no window of that name exists/appears, the "button" is a real 
button, which executes the associated action. 
If the action starts a window with the long-awaited name, the button 
gets REPLACED by the swallowed application, so no more invocations of 
the application are possible.

So I don't think it is possible, what you want to do, unless someone 
modifies FvwmButtons to intercept events for swallowed applications.

That the return does trigger the action... hmm.
Might be that this is because xload sets the Mwmhints input to false 
("I never ever want the keyboard focus." - note: I'm not an X programmer,
I've just been following the discussion here for a long time.)


I just checked: 
	I can reproduce the xload behaviour.
	The action doesn't work, if put on a swallowed perfmeter.
		(this does react to keystrokes.)
	xbiff also refuses keystrokes, and the action works.

Seem like I guessed right with the motif input hint.

Is there any similar hint for mouse input? (some sort of SkipFocus flag?)
Can we simulate that, or can we just filter the Event stream to the
application without any hint.

J> xterm -title top@clove -e top') 
J> ---- End of included text -------------------------8<--- and here -------------

J> Again nothing happens with mouse clicks, but FvwmButtons crashes

I got this one:

X Error (intercepted): BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
Major Request Code   : 62
Minor Request Code   : 0
Resource ID (XID)    : 31457301
Error Serial Number  : 706

Don't know why the generic mouse action does work, and the mouse n doesn't.

I think Jarl meant NoClose to be used in conjunction with UseOld, in order
to swallow old apps/unswallow them on exit.

But this only works, when I do a "killmodule FvwmButtons" from FvwmTalk.
If I restart Fvwm2, new xbiff/xclock/console/perfmeter are created, while
the old processes are still alive, though they're NOT mapped anywhere.

(And I deleted the -geometry -1500-1500 as well as I set WindowListHit,
ShowMapping, Icon and Title styles.)


hope this triggers some more thoughts.

Due to RSI problems which I suspect are brought on by mousing, I'm trying
to configure fvwm to let me use my keyboard for things like iconification,
refocusing, etc. It's great for almost all of this, but there's one thing
I can't figure out how to do -- I can't get a key bound to a mouse button.
I can use my kbd to move my cursor over a URL in my browser, for example,
but I can't get a key to simulate a mouse click. Does anyone know how to
do this in fvwm?

I'll upgrade to the latest version if that's necessary, so I'm not going
to try to figure out my version number, but it might be useful for you to
know that I'm running fvwm on a Sparc, Solaris 2.4.

Note that I'm not on this list, so could you make sure I'm cc'ed in all
replies, please?

Thanks.

Unfortunately, I think it can't be done in the obvious (and most
desireable) way because it would be hard to distinguish when the mouse
click is supposed to do a FvwmButtons action and when it should be
passed to the swallowed app.  For example, two of the things I have
FvwmButtons swallow, xbuffy and FvwmPager, both require that mouse
clicks be passed to them or they won't operate properly, and if I
click in the xbuffy to view the headers in a mailbox, which I often do
to see if the mail is important, then I wouldn't want any other
assigned FvwmButton action to happen.

What can work, though not quite as visually pleasing as I suspect
you'd like, is to put the swallowing button inside a container and
assign the action to the container.  If you set the padding to
something >0 in the container, clicking in the pad area will perform
your defined click action.  I didn't have any real use for it, but I
tried the following for grins and when I clicked in the padding to the
left of the xbuffy and the right of the pager, sure enough an xterm
was launched:

*FvwmButtons(26x1, Frame 0, Padding 4 0, \
	Action `Exec "XTerm" xcmd xterm`, \
	Container(Frame 1, Padding 0 0 Rows 1))
*FvwmButtons(Swallow(Kill) XBuffy "Exec xcmd xbuffy")
*FvwmButtons(Swallow(Kill) FvwmPager "Module FvwmPager 0 3")
*FvwmButtons(End)

Hope this helps,

You can't.

Try upgrading your X server.  The XKEYBOARD extension, included in X11R6.1,
has the ability to map keystrokes to mouse events.

Hello,

I am experiencing a problem with icons using fvwm ver 1.24.

They simply dont show at all, so my screen looks bad and all teh 
stuff is very small. The line in system.fvwmrc looks like this:

*GoodStuff      Kill    rbomb.xpm       Destroy

this is just one example. The paths are set as:

ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm:/usr/bin/X11
PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/
IconPath   /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/

I am running the fvwm on a DEC AlphaStation using DEC Unix 

I hope that someone van help me resolve my problem.

well all mouse events that don't have any action defined for it, are passed
through. 
It's like the mouse settings, or character bindings under X.
I had to unmap several Meta-anything sequences from mwm, when I wanted to
run emacs under it. (quite some time ago, but it was quite a search then.)

If the user defines a mouse-1 click, for a swallowed Xbuffy, he can't
expect to see the headers any more.

I think this use would be mostly for X apps, that don't need mouse events.

(Note that apps that don't need Keyboard focus, can be used with an action,
but this has to be defined as just "Action cmd" i.e: no mouse button
argument specified. You can invoke this action by pointing the mouse on the
swallowed application and then hitting return. I use this to open the door
at the insitute via the swallowed xload panel, and to start emacsclient
with ~/RMAIL from the swallowed xbiff)

Hi Folks

Using fvwm 2.0.42 on Irix 6.2. I tend to use the titlebars of windows to
convey lots of information, especially xterms where I have the current
working directory shown. I like to see this information even when iconised,
so I use e.g.
	Style "XTerm"       Icon none.xpm
This gives me an icon with the window title in a long thin bar, which
is just what I want. However, the width of the icon bar is calculated
to be the right size for the text when the window is *first* iconised. If
the title changes and the window iconised again the width isn't
recalculated. This can only be forced by doing an explicit Recapture or
Restart. Does anyone know a way around this? Is it a bug or a feature? :-)

An additional thing I've noticed: when using none.xpm, on being de-iconised
the window pops up with focus, but *under* existing windows. If the window
is given a real xpm as icon it pops up on top. This is using SmartPlacement
but on a crowded screen with big windows.

And, er, one more thing while I'm here :-). Some applications (such as
netscape ... boo hiss) produce their own builtin icon instead of nothing
when told Style none.xpm. Anyone know of a way to beat such clients into
submission?

Cheers to everyone who works on fvwm ... it's the best.

To whomever may help me,

	     I am trying to upgrade to Fvwm 2.0.42 and it seems to work (I've 
got some other problems), but I cannot get the FvwmConfig module to 
compile.  I go to the FvwmConfig directory, type xmkmf (I am running 
Linux 1.3.99 with AcceleratedX server).  The xmkmf works fine and when 
I type make install, I get errors such as this:

WinBase.o(.text+0x76d): undefined reference to `XSetWMProperties'
WinBase.o(.text+0x7b1): undefined reference to `XGetGCValues'
WinBase.o(.text+0x7c5): undefined reference to `XCreateGC'
WinBase.o(.text+0x7fd): undefined reference to `XGetGCValues'

WinBase.o(.text+0x83d): undefined reference to `XGetGCValues'
WinBase.o(.text+0x84d): undefined reference to `XCreateGC'

I get a whole mess of these before the compile just quits.  It is for 
almost all of the WinXXXX.o files also.  I checked the directories in 
the Makefile and they seem fine.  I also looked and the files it is 
looking for that have those functions, like the files X.h, Xinit.h are 
in the right directory.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks in advance.

(I'm running linux ELF.)

The problem that has been reported by several people about earlier
versions of fvwm2 is still with us.  When I quit a module
(tkgoodstuff, using a pretty simple tkfvwm extension to tcl/tk) and
restart it several times, I very often get fvwm eating up all the CPU.

Does anyone who understands fvwm's side of the module interface have
an idea what fvwm might be doing?  If there is something I can do to
debug, please let me know.

Cheers,
Mark

Did you compile fvwm with the m4 option turned on?  If so, you
probably need to quote the Pixmap and Icon paths as include is a
reserved word in most implementations of m4 and so your paths will get
munged.  The default m4 quotes are `' so you might try

PixmapPath `/usr/include/X11/pixmaps'
IconPath `/usr/include/X11/bitmaps'

You might want to use a different quoting scheme if you need to use
those quote characters in other parts of your .fvwmrc.  In that case,
put a line like

changequote({,})
PixmapPath {/usr/include/X11/pixmaps}
IconPath {/usr/include/X11/bitmaps}

at the beginning of the .fvwmrc.

Alternatively, 1.24 might have a command line options to set the quote
characters.  Something like -m4-squote and -m4-equote to set the start
and end quotes respectively.  I don't remember when that became part
of 1.24, though, so if you're not running the latest you may not have
it.

It is fvwm itself (i.e. not the X server) churning away, right?

Well, you could try forcing it to coredump (or attaching a debugger,
which I can tell you is sometimes a pain - you may want to do it from
another virtual terminal) and see where it is (stack trace).  Or you
could try using the linux 'strace' (I think that's the one) facitlity
that shows system calls for a running process - this might indicate
what's eating all the cpu.

If you can get a general location, that would be a good start.

BTW, If you haven't yet, go see your doctor about that.  I believe I have
a case of tendonitis which I thought was carpal tunnel until I finally
went in to my doctor and got tested some months ago.  Just knowing it
wasn't carpal let me rest a little easier.

Oh, and as they told me, take breaks, relax, exercise!

One of the things I reported earlier today (the problem with fvwm
dying on tkgoodstuff restart), is caused by the following feature of
the module interface: if there are 14 or more arguments to a "Module"
call, fvwm will die.  (The tkgoodstuff restart code appended the
arguments it was called with to the Module command it sent to fvwm,
which meant 5 additional arguments (the ones fvwm adds) each time.)
Maybe this is an fvwm bug, but I'm no longer concerned about it.

Subject: FVWM: window re-sizing
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

Hi,

I'm running "Fvwm Ver 2.0 pl 32", and have a question about window
re-sizing.

I was looking at the Maximize fundtion, and it only seems able to
re-size a window in terms of percentage of screen size, or in terms of
pixels.  Is there a way to get it to re-size in terms of rows/cols?

Alternatively, is there a way to capture the size before maximizing so
that I can use some title-bar button to return to the original size,
even after multiple re-size ops have taken place?

Right now, I have a button that makes a window half the screen width and
1/3 the screen height, but at the font size I use, 1/2 the screen width
turns out to be 79 cols.  I can obviously change the percentages that
I'm using, but I'd like to be a little more general about the solution
if possible.


thanks,
tw

Hi all (especially Chuck) -


I just got off the phone with Digital, and I have more information.

It seems that the problem probably has to do with Hebrew - ie. most of
you out there are very unlikely to have seen it. Anyway, what they
told me is that the window and icon names are compound text - not
regular text. That means that the string includes binary information -
apparently the escapes I am seeing. They said that fvwm is probably
treating the strings as regular text, and not as compound text. Can
anyone confirm (or preferably fix) this ?


TIA.

BTW. - Anyone with Digital UNIX can reproduce this behavior by
installing the worldwide kit (no license necessary).

Yup - you may have missed it, but I announced to the lists one day
that it would definitely be in the next beta in some form.  I didn't
plan to keep the old Focus function around though, I figured I'd make
it (Focus) just do the focus, and people could use something like to
following to get the old behavior if they wanted it:

  AddToFunc FocusAndWarp "I" Focus $w
  +                      "I" WarpToWindow $w 2p 2p

I'll probably put something like that in the sample rc file as well.

Yeah, it's taking forever, but that's how things go sometimes.  I plan
to make the next beta (2.0.43) be the last beta, and then make the
following be 2.1.0 after a hopefully real short final cleanup period.

I know I've said things like this a couple of times in the past, but I
think it may actually happen this time. :)

Hello,

I have just switched to fvwm2...

I am trying to integrate the pager in the Buttonbar, the line I made is as
follows:

*FvwmButtons(4x2) - whatever Swallow "FvwmPager" Module FvwmPager 0 0

As I understood this from the man page this should display my pager in a
box 4 times standard icon length and 2 times as high as standard icon.

I have two rows declared, and the pager button is the last button. In this
configuration the pager is drawn in a single height 8xlength box, quite
squashed. It works only if I put the pager as one of the firt items. I find
this a bit odd, since I prefer the pager in the right lower corner (I HAVE
enough buttons to push it there...)

Then some other questions:

the option -update 1 for the xclock does not seem to work...

are there log/error files of fvwm ? Or are the errors only reported in the
.xsession-errors file? If this is the case could it be possible to include
the line number of the offending line?

Is there a simple way to find out the size of the pixmaps used by the
button bar especially which pixmaps determines the size of an icon (and
thus the size of the iconbar)?


I like windows with very small borders, I do not get it managed to reduce
the standard size....

ciao

If you use a "Container" to put all your buttons is you will effectively have 
a button large enough to override the placement of the Pager as the biggest 
button. That is, assuming you have 2.0.42. The details of how to handle
containers are in the manual page for FvwmButtons.

Is their any way (apart from writing your own drag&drop functions) to
use Motif drag&drop to drag objects to another fvwm viewport (by

Well, honestly I don't think I'd make any changes to fvwm to work with
any specific file manager (several reasons: don't want to bloat the
code, don't see where it buys a lot since most individual programs
won't respond to the drag and drop protocols, don't want to have to
support several different file managers with several different drag
and drop schemes, etc), but I'd like to make some suggestions here
that might make it possible from your end only.

Please bear in mind that I don't use any file managers myself, and
have never seen MFM in action.

AR> Some of the things others have suggested to me is:

AR>   - drag-n-drop to/from GoodStuff Applications Launcher

Going with my above statement, I don't think I would ever make
GoodStuff (or rather FvwmButtons, the equivalent in 2.xx) have any
specific drag and drop capabilites.

But I think what might be better is to give MFM it's own toolbar (like
GoodStuff/FvwmButtons), which could perhaps be torn off (or made a
separate program entirely), and add code to MFM to allow it to be
compiled as an fvwm module.

Also, in the not too distant future there will be some modules that
will allow for shell script communication with a running fvwm, and an
idea similiar to that could be used as well (so MFM wouldn't have to
be invoked as a module).

And by building the toolbar into MFM, it would have drag and drop
functionality under any window manager, not just fvwm.  And under
fvwm, it could also possibly perform fvwm specific window manager
functions (much like tkgoodstuff).

AR>   - dynamic main window menu's

There are pseudo facilities to do this now in the 2.xx betas, and will
probably be slightly easier in the next beta (2.0.43) and the first
official release (2.1.0) which should be out shortly after that.

AR>   - GUI interface to build .fvwmrc files

Actually, two of these exist right now that I know of:

    - FvwmConfig, module included in 2.xx, but isn't very good as far
      as I know (that's stated right in the man page - honestly I've
      never even compiled it.  Rob made it before he retired from
      working on fvwm).

    - The Dotfile Generator, which also can create .emacs and .tcshrc
      files.  Never seen it, but I've heard good things about it.
      Check out the official fvwm web page (http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/)
      for a pointer to it.

Not trying to discourage you from adding one to MFM, just letting you
know that some exist.

Also, if certain little, prefferably generally applicable code changes
or additions to fvwm could make things easier, I may add them.  I did
one such thing for the freeware OFFIX drag and drop protocol (see
http://gutenberg.lcmi.ufsc.br/OffiX for info on that, which I should
probably have a pointer to on the fvwm home page) that allowed client
message events to be passed on from an icon to the program instead of
being ignored, which I thought should probably be done anyways (even
though every window manager that I looked at seemed to just throw that
event out in this case).

Now, I should respond to a related note:

As you see in my above comments, I don't think it's a must (but that's

This would require coding changes on WordPerfect's part, for it to do
it itself, which is actually different from what you requested.  The
button bar would have to be recoded to recognize the drop, and invoke
WordPerfect with that file passed as a command line parm to it.  The
former would actually have much more functionality, as you could then
probably also drag onto a running WordPerfect...

Good for a simple linear button bar, but the latest version of
FvwmButtons is more powerful layout wise.  Besides, how would you tell
whether or not what you were dragging was meant to be a new button or
a parameter to another exec?  And where to get the icon?  This would
be much simpler in an MFM specific toolbar (like I discussed above), I
think.

As I said, I actually don't see where it buys a lot, since not many
programs would recognize the drag and drop protocol themselves.  That
would be the real win (for those that like and use drag&drop).  But
until one becomes a real standard...

If you put the "Send Module" thing into fvwm in 2.0.43, then please let me
know so that I can crank out an FvwmIconMan that'll use it. If not, no
biggie.

It'll sure be nice to see a released version of fvwm out. Between fvwm,
linux, and vim, I seem to spend most of my time compiling the latest and
greatest betas.

FvwmButtons isn't interested in the information, which is passed from Mfm

I'd vote for an mfm feature to create one or more toolbars with drag &
drop, which I could swallow from FvwmButtons then.
No hassle for Chuck who is already quite overloaded, no long response times
on feature requests from the mfm people, no mfm specific drag & drop target
functions in fvwm(buttons).

I guess, you can't do all the tweaks from a configuration generator, but
it'd certainly help novices/occasional users.

well a combined desktop/file manager is no new idea.
I guess it started with Apple, went on to Norton Desktop for Windows, PC
Tools Desktop for Windows, Windows 95 has then more or less just killed the
market for these afterproducts for Windoze.

In general I think, it's a good idea, but I don't know how to have fvwm2 &
mfm part one root window in a smooth manner (- without bounding boxes:
"You can't put that file icon there, because it's the fvwm side of the root
window !!!"), without them being integrated.
Even if mfm were a module for fvwm, it'd just have some sort of transparent
window (rectangular!) in which to place it's icon. No placing icons
anywhere else.

(might be that I overlooked sth. here, I've some sort of "incompleteness"
feeling)

Would certainly be nice. One way was desribed above: mfm button bar, maybe
swallowed by FvwmButtons.

Maybe sth like this already exists (roughly):
Create a button which executes the command "wordperfect `print_selection`":
you just mark the file with the mouse and press the button.
Mfm could always put the highlighted file in the pastebuffer automagically,
so that you just click on the filename and then on the button.
(I know the command isn't print_selection, but `p?? -xyz`, but I can't
remember now.)

It's not directly drag`n`drop, but it`s close, and fvwm shouldn`t support
multiple drag`n`drop interfaces.

It might be different, if mfm and other file managers could come to terms
with a single drag'n'drop interface, but maybe not. ;^)


Chuck> This would require coding changes on WordPerfect's part, for it to do
Chuck> it itself.
If wordperfect recognized a file dropped onto it's icon, it'd still do so,
if swallowed in FvwmButtons (maybe via an own iconmanager - ewww, that
needs some smoothing), or in a special iconbox, filled with drag'n drop
receivers, swallowed into FvwmButtons (I like the latter MUCH less).

This should be doable quite easily - am I right ?
(I guess our Capacity on these issues is still with The Green Men, is he?)

I do second that, but it would mean either integrate, or use existing
interfaces. (Maybe with slight extensions, as long as they are generally
useful extensions. No one wants to see mfm-specific functions bloat fvwm,
when most people don't use them. But then I think most people would use the
file manager part, if they were integrated. It's maybe just a matter of 
"I don't need no steenking Windoze" ?)

It shouldn't even bother fvwm, which drag'n'drop interface the application
uses. Just make sure, FvwmButtons can swallow an iconified application and
passes on all events from the icon to the application.

If WordPerfect and Mfm can agree on an interface to use, fvwm shouldn't
keep them from communicating.

Okie doke, here's a strace (notice a pattern?) with tkgoodstuff running:

select(256, [3 9 13], [12], NULL, NULL) = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
select(256, [3 9 13], [12], NULL, NULL) = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
select(256, [3 9 13], [12], NULL, NULL) = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = 0
select(256, [3 9 13], [12], NULL, NULL) = 1 (out [12])

(etc.)

When I kill tkgoodstuff, it changes to this:

select(256, [3 13], [12], NULL, NULL)   = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
select(256, [3 13], [12], NULL, NULL)   = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
select(256, [3 13], [12], NULL, NULL)   = 1 (out [12])
write(12, "\377\377\377\377\0\4\0\0\t\0\0\000"..., 36) = -1 EAGAIN (Try again)
ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
wait4(-1, NULL, WNOHANG, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
select(256, [3 13], [12], NULL, NULL)   = 1 (out [12])

I've been using SloppyFocus so long I'm amazed I never noticed before,
but if a sloppyfocus window is focused but the mouse is completely
outside the window, including the decorations, then apparently either
the side or frame context (I always combine them so I can't
distinguish) is used.  This should be documented.  Although I think
it's correct, it did take me by surprise.

I have a local list of stuff that I'm trying to put into the next

I plan to have that in there as well.  Perhaps I'll notify you & give
you a tar file in advance so your changes can be incorporated as
well...

Sure will.  Then I can start to tackle some of the bigger items on the
TO-DO list...

I've used an early version of the taskbar module from the first fvwm95
under 1.24r without problems. Does anyone know if the updated taskbar
will work under "plain" fvwm 2.x? I like the module, but I prefer the
look-and-feel of fvwm.

I think I have found a 'buglet', which although small is dead 
annoying.

The situation:
	I have to use certain plotting windows, which are huge and awkward,
	along with an xterm (which must be of a fixed height should I
	wish to use certain commands and actually have scrolling *work*).

	There isn't quite room for both on screen, so I generally shove the
	plotting window up a bit, so that its titlebar is partly or
	mostly offscreen. This way I get to see the title of the plot and
	the x scale while still being able to type. Perfect.

The problem:
	Should I iconise this plotting window to get at something else
	for a moment when I uniconise it it appears on the page below the
	one I am on...so that part of the title bar is all that I get.

	It should of course be in that place, but one page up.

Any ideas? I have had this happen before but now that I am repeating the
same thing I realise why now and again certain windows appear on the
wrong page when uniconised. Their titlebars were off the top of that page.

Its minor but it definately does not seem right, this behaviour should
be fixed.

Hello again,

I am asking for some help regarding icons again. 
I compiled fvwm with no m4 and with XPM on a
DEC Alpha station running digital unix.

The desktop wont show icons, evenif the paths are set correctly.

can anyone give me a hint as to what to look for to take care
of the problem, or better still is there someone running fvwm on
Digital DEC Alpha Station 600 with DEC unix 

Thank you inn advance

MAtjaz

I think I'm seeing a similar problem....
I have a 2x2 desktop, and as part of the startup, I place exmh in the 
upper right corner of the upper right page - this requires a very 
large X coordinate. If I go to this page before exmh has appeard, it 
ends up 95% too far to the right.
Another positioning problem I see is:
I have 4 2x2 desktops.  Netscape is running on desk 3 in the upper 
left page.  I attemp to do something that will time out & pop up a 
dialog.  In the meantime I go to another desktop & am working in, 
say, the upper right page.  When the dialog appears, it's on the 
correct desktop, but on the same page as I am at currently, say, 
upper right.

I'm using fvwm 2.0.41 with no patches.

Yes, I do read it and I saw your notes the other day.  I've been
pretty busy lately, which delays responses (obviously).  Sometimes I'm
able to give near instantanious responses, sometimes it takes a few
days, and sometimes I may forget to respond altogether. :)

I was also waiting to see if anyone else using fvwm under DEC Alphas
had anything to say about the problem.

I do normally prefer people to go through the mailing list, but the
occasional note sent directly to me is ok (and for some notes, more
appropriate).

Hmm.  Perhaps, but it's not coming to me right now.  If so, I probably
have their notes saved.  I'll have to take a look when I get a chance
(I have a LOT of fvwm related mail in several folders right now).
Otherwise, they may have been in contact with Rob before he 'retired'.

The quick response is that I believe fvwm is treating all text as just
normal ASCII strings right now.  There isn't any international text
support in there right now.

I've been considering adding some support, but it hasn't been high on
my list.  Getting docs updated and taking care of performance issues &
bugs has been has been more important, which I'm sure you'll agree.

Then I'll get the first official release out the door so I can start
handling the bigger work items I have planned for fvwm.  This may fall
into that category, I'm not sure having not really investigated it
yet.

Although this has been in the back of my mind, I never put it on the
TO-DO list as an investigation item, so I'll do so now.

I believe that some of the folks on this list from Japan have done
some work in this area as well.  Perhaps they can also offer some
insight.

I don't think so.  I believe Motif D&D is grabbing the server during
these drags and stopping all wm functions.

Setting the following X resource:

          *DragInitiatorProtocolStyle: drag_dynamic

seems to help somewhat - the program I checked didn't grab the server
so some fvwm actions happened normally (like windows appearing) but it
still wouldn't flip pages.

Unfortunately I don't have any more time to play with it right now.
I'll try to look into it.

This question may not belong to this list, but anyway ...

Is it possible to change the title/iconname of a xterm-window dynamically 
to show the name of the process running in the foreground if such one exists 
or if such one does not exist the current directory ?

I am using the taskbar in fvwm2, but it looses some of its value when you 
have 5 icons all named 'xterm'. It would be really nice if you could see 
what was running in those xterms.

This is what I use to change the xterm title to include my current host
and directory.  The iconname has also been changed to reflect the host.
BTW, this is all for bash.  You set your prompt to this string and then
each time your prompt changes, the title/iconname is updated:

	PS1="\[\033]0;\h:\w\007\033]1;\h\007\]\h\$ "

The \033 implies an ESC character. The \007 implies a ^G.

I don't have an alpha, but I do have a DECstation running Ultrix, and I
just wanted to let you know that my icons are working just fine, in case
that gives you some encouragement.  I say this because Ultrix (even 4.3,
which is where we stopped upgrading), is pretty hokey.  Lots of stuff
doesn't work right.  The Alpha boxes run OSF or something, don't they?
I would hope that a lot of the time that DEC didn't spend fixing up
Ultrix was spent getting OSF right, so I doubt that it's your
workstation.  

Why did you compile it without m4?  I compiled everything in, and I have
found that m4 is semi-handy.  Maybe if you re-build it, you will find
some detail that you inadvertently skipped the first time.  That's all I
can say.

I seem to be having a bit of trouble reaching the outside world with mail,
so this is a repost of my earlier message. I'd greatly appreciate it
if a couple of people could just let me know this has made it to the list.
Thanks a lot,
Ric.

Repost:

Hi Folks

Using fvwm 2.0.42 on Irix 6.2. I tend to use the titlebars of windows to
convey lots of information, especially xterms where I have the current
working directory shown. I like to see this information even when iconised,
so I use e.g.
	Style "XTerm"       Icon none.xpm
This gives me an icon with the window title in a long thin bar, which
is just what I want. However, the width of the icon bar is calculated
to be the right size for the text when the window is *first* iconised. If
the title changes and the window iconised again the width isn't
recalculated. This can only be forced by doing an explicit Recapture or
Restart. Does anyone know a way around this? Is it a bug or a feature? :-)

An additional thing I've noticed: when using none.xpm, on being de-iconised
the window pops up with focus, but *under* existing windows. If the window
is given a real xpm as icon it pops up on top. This is using SmartPlacement
but on a crowded screen with big windows.

And, er, one more thing while I'm here :-). Some applications (such as
netscape ... boo hiss) produce their own builtin icon instead of nothing
when told Style none.xpm. Anyone know of a way to beat such clients into
submission?

Cheers to everyone who works on fvwm ... it's the best.

Ric

This wouldn't be so bad, except it redraws the entire line everytime you type
a character.  Not too bad on localhost, but very slow over a modem ...

Anyone ever figure out how to keep the redraw from occurring?

My solution was to do this:

PS1='\h\w:\$ '
if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]; then
  function cd ()
  {
    builtin cd $*
    xtitle "${HOSTNAME%%.*}:$PWD `cat /etc/ip` (`date`)"
  }
  else
  function cd ()
  {
    builtin cd $*
  }
fi
xtitle=()
{
    echo -e -n "\033]2;$*\007"
}

(also for bash)

Well. . . .since you mentioned it, I actually do this:

	if [ "${TERM}" = "xterm" ]; then
		if [ "${GROUP:-}" != "" ]; then
			PS1="\[\033]0;\h:${GROUP}:\w\007\033]1;\h\007\]\h\$ "
		else
			PS1="\[\033]0;\h:\w\007\033]1;\h\007\]\h\$ "
		fi
	else
		if [ -n "${GROUP:-}" ]; then
			PS1="${GROUP}\h:\w\$ "
		else
			PS1="\h:\w\$ "
		fi
	fi

BUT, he wasn't asking about all the nitty-gritty details.

Below is a snippet from a TCL script I use to set the title of each new xterm I
create.  The key is the ESC sequences...

------------

proc setXTermTitle {title} {
  # Set title of the XTERM
  puts -nonewline "\033]2;$title\007";
  # Set ICON label of XTERM
  puts -nonewline "\033]1;$title\007";
}

------------

Here's mine...


#!/bin/csh -f

# Sets the title bar of an xterm
# (My addition)

if( $?term ) then
	if( $term == "xterm" ) then
		echo -n "]2;`hostname`:`pwd`"

endif

And I use the following in my .cshrc, which gives me prompts suitable for
both text terminals and X terms:


alias a alias
a ll 'ls -lFa'
a pd pushd

a setprompt 'set prompt="$user@$host `dirs` \! > "'

a pushd 'pushd \!:* ; setprompt'
a popd 'popd ; setprompt'
a cd 'cd \!:* ; setprompt'
a telnet 'telnet \!:* ; setprompt'
a rlogin 'rlogin \!:* ; setprompt'

# doesn't work properly on Linux and some other systems
# so, we make the aliases to call setprompt directly
if( $?TERM ) then
	if( $TERM == "xterm" || $TERM == "xterms" ) then
		unalias setprompt
		a setprompt 'set prompt="$user@$host \! > " ; /usr/bin/pwdtitle '
		if( $?SHELL ) then
		  if( `basename $SHELL` == "tcsh" ) then
		    a setprompt 'set prompt="%n@%m#%l %h %?%# "; /usr/bin/pwdtitle'
		  endif
		endif

	endif
endif

I got the newest sources last week and compiled them on my 486sx
notebook running Linux 1.3.20 from slackware 3.0 distribution.
Everything works great!

I compiled on my 386/40 desktop running the same Linux (I think
everything is installed the same) but get no icon box.  The pager lives
at the lower right hand corner, xload is on the taskbar, and I don't git
no steenking icons on my startup menu.

Any ideas???

That's been done (known as the "devices" window in mfm), but it's currently
not detachable. The way it works is, you drop something on one of the targets,
and a script of your own devising is run. So, a "device" like the printer can
in fact run lpr %s, etc., or a "device" called WordPerfect can invoke itself
with dropped file as the document (no special ability of WP required)

I'd hate to be forced to a separate toolbar, only from the standpoint
that you have Button/GoodStuff icons, and the mfm icons competing for space.
If they were swallowed, then there's the possibility that the drag-n-drop
icons would be shrunk too small to be usable. And besides, you'd still 
potentially have two icons for the same app, which is a royal pain.

What we got now are icon buttons which are sensitive to depressing, and
evoke the action specified in the Buttons/GoodStuff region of the .fvwm2rc
file. What I am seeing is extending that, so we have a depress action specified,
and a file-drop action.

At that point, there's the issue of not wanting to support one drag-n-drop
protocol over another. I've not done of survey of the others that are out
there, but certainly I can look at what it would take to grab Andrew's
drag-n-drop library, make it into a fvwm module (so you provide everyone
equal opportunity for support), and go from there. The question is,
(since I'm a user of 1.2.4r and not very familiar with 2.x yet), I know
the window manager can talk to modules; are modules allowed to talk to 
other modules? Especially, can their advising the other module of something
be considered an "event"?

And if they are, would you folks like to have more than one action type
associated with the FvwmButtons module?

Thanks. I think I got that one licked.

> I know several people on the mailing list have compiled under HPUX.
 
Yeah, and we got 1.2.4r running happily, too. I just never saw such wholesale
disregard of things in the system header files. I HAVE to figure out how
our imake configuration files did that... :-(

Actually, Andrew's was published a while ago in the X Resource, so if
nothing else, there might be some folks out there working from his paper.

As with everything else, standards are meant to be ignored until something
"killer" arrives, who may not even feature that standard prominently, but
still compel folks to go that route. OLE is a classic of that paradign :-)

Ok.. here we go... I have IconBox, ButtonBox, and Pager running.  The 
pager is 3x2... Running Linux 1.2.13, Xinside's Accelerated-X 1.3.  I 
doubt the machine matters (it's huge  ;)

So... pop up a new app with interactive placement, and put the cursor 
against the top of the display (top left section of the desktop in the 
pager)  jump the cursor real fast into the top left corner of the 
display.  After a *quick* pause, the cursor jumps half the distance from 
that corner to the original position, and the new app window meets it 
there.  To get the app into the upper-left corner, you must *eeeeease* it 
into position.

Dunno what's causing it... dunno if it happens to anyone else either  =)

Hi,

	I've been running fvwm on DEC's alpha 2100's and 3000's, all
 the way from 3.0, through 3.2 and not 4.0 Field test version 4.0.
 Unfortunately, I have X11R6 from mit compiled (soon to be R6.1), and
 there have been no problems.

	I don't know how I could help with your problem ...

I recently compiled fvwm-2.0.42 on an HP735 with HP-UX 9.01 and gcc-2.7.2.
Everything compiles OK. When I start up fvwm I get something like the 
following

[ERROR] Can't load module /usr/local/lib/fvwm2 PixmapsPath
[ERROR] Can't load module /usr/local/lib/fvwm2 IconPath

This is what's in my .fvwm2rc:

ModulePath /usr/local/lib/fvwm2/
PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/
IconPath   /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/

As a result of this no icons are loaded and no modules. Has anyone come
across this before.

Thanks in advance.

Paul

I just joined this list because I have the same problem on my Linux.

I tried to place a -DXPM in Fvwm.tmpl #define FvwmCompilerFlags.
It solved the problem, but the patch that should make you able
to put pixmaps in the window titlebars still didn't seem to work.

I have tried both with and without the titlebar patch, so I know that
the problem isn't caused by the patch.

Maybe I have missed something? I did as the INSTALL-file said, i.e.
I edited configure.h and Fvwm.tmpl before I distributed the Makefiles
and compiled with make and make install.

I have Linux 1.2.13, gcc 2.7.0 and I am using the SVGA-server.
(fvwm 2.0.42.)

True, *BUT* I was hoping for even more ;-) Suppose I have an xterm in 
which I start top, gdb or something like that. Has anyone found out how 
I can make the window title reflect that ? In pseudo-code I'd like 
something like :

  set prg = program running in the foreground
  if (prg = shell) then
    title = cwd
  else
    title = prg
  endif

Well, you could just write wrappers for all the commands you run...
Probably something that knows how to parse argv[0] so you could just
make a generic wrapper.  This is an ugly solution.

I think a better solution would be to add something to your shell
that would allow you to run some command before the fork/exec
of your input.  tcsh has the `precmd` which is sort of what we want
but backwards.  I use it to set the xterm title to the current working
directory and the hostname.  `precmd` is executed before the prompt
is displayed.  What we need is a sort of `postcmd` that is executed 
AFTER you press enter on the CL.

And for our next silly project we can use the graphics features in
rxvt to create icons in our windows. *gag*

Have a good one.

Using 'Next [CurrentScreen] Focus' will select windows on another desk,
but on the same virtual page number.  It seems to me that CurrentScreen
should only select windows in the current view port (ie screen).  What
CurrentScreen does should probably be called CurrentPage.

Then you would have:

	CurrentScreen (only windows you can see)
	CurrentPage (only windows on the same virtual page number)
	CurrentDesk (only windows on the current virtual desktop)

What does everyone else think?  Change CurrentScreen and add CurrentPage?

I had the same confusion and agree with your suggested changes.
However, in case haven't already figured it out (you didn't say) you
can get the behavior you want by doing

Don't do that! It is an incomplete solution. You miss a lot of other
things besides simple pixmap support.

Just after that I sent my reply I found out that there is an archive
of old articles that one can search in. I found there that the
problem is caused by a bug in Fvwm.tmpl. It can be solved be changing

#ifdef FvwmCompiler
        CC = FvwmCompiler
#endif
#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags
#endif

into

#ifdef FvwmCompiler
        CC = FvwmCompiler
#endif
#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CDEBUGFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags
#endif

Hello,
Could Fvwm use overlay planes (supported by HP, SGI, IBM, DEC) whenever
available for menus and the "window location" window ?
SGIs don't have saveunders, so the fvwm menus slow down screen refresh a
lot. Using overlays would be the best way to avoid this.
If somebody volunteers for adding overlay support but needs some example
code, I think a good implementation can be found in the latest Mesa 3D
library (ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/tmp/Mesa-1.2.8beta.tar.gz and
http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html).

Is there a limit to the number of things/windows FVWM V42 will
allow open at once?

When I try to open my 40th (or so, I'm not sure exactly how many
windows I'm removing from the Window List) window, I get the following
message:

XIO:  fatal IO error 54 (Connection reset by peer) on X server "flamingo:0.0"
      after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.

and

Broken Pipe


Ignoring whether or not you think I need this many windows (I do), does
anyone know to fix this?  It seems to be a limit, because if I close one
of the windows, I can open another, but no more after that.

Hello -

I would like to have the scroll bars for my windows be on the right
side instead of the left. Is there a way to do this with fvwm? If 
so, how do I modify the config files to make it happen? is this not
handled by fvwm, but an option in X11 file elsewhere?

Thanks for your time.

May I introduce ... O.K.?

chuck_hines> I believe that some of the folks on this list from Japan
chuck_hines> have done some work in this area as well.  Perhaps they
chuck_hines> can also offer some insight.

In japan, we use i18n-patch of fvwm. It enables fvwm to handle
compound text in the titlebar and icon, to designate fontset instead
of font, and of course, to use non-ASCII characters in the context of
character (button name of FvwmButtons, FvwmForm, and so on).

This patch uses X's i18n feature ONLY, so any charsets which can be
handled by i18n framework will be displayed (I think). Patch is made
in two years ago (when fvwm version is 1.20 :-), and supported by the
people in "Fvwm Users' Mailing List in Japan". Patch for the latest
version of fvwm (2.0.42) is also available.

Anybody interested in this patch may get these patches freely by ftp.
Check keyword 'fvwm-users-jp-kits' by archie. I18n patch of fvwm is
included in fvwm-users-jp-kits-VERSION.tar.gz (VERSION is a string of
the release date). Be aware that most of documents are written in
japanese (very sorry).

Could you please add a few more directives for the TitleStyle command:
1) Full[ActivePixmapUp,ActivePixmapDown,InActivePixmap] <pixmap>
   this one would be practically the same as FullPixmap <pixmap> is for
   ButtonStyle (meaning that the whole titlebar area would be covered with
   the pixmap)
2) Height <value>  - this would be really useful for fitting the pixmap
   on the titlebar without having to fight with different font sizes etc..

I don't think these additions would be impossible to make and they would
most certainly match my needs. I would have personally tried to make them
but it seems that my C programmin skills aren't adequate (yet) =)

Btw, thanks for the first patch too (it is great!)

I am only running 1.24r but I was wondering if this
problem manifests itself under 2.042.

I have a window which defines itself as an override redirect
window. Now as far as I understand the window manager should
not manage these windows :-(

I cannot use any fvwm settings to make these StayOnTop or
that because fvwm isn't managing them.

The problem is that I cannot get the window to receive focus.
This occurs with both ClickToFocus & Focus follows mouse.
It is not in the windowlist, but fvwm can circle windows
behind/infront, so it knows a window is there.

As far as I was aware, the window manager should not manage it,
but it should not ignore the window.


Has anyone else experienced these problems or could offer
an explanation  or solution

I have compiled fvwm-2.0.42 on my HP-UX 9.05 and I have discovered
that I am lacking the FvwmFileMgr and SideButtons.  I am using the 
fvwm2rc-oreos that was on the internet.  I am not sure if these are
special modules that he had implemented or if I am just missing them.

If they are special modules, is there any way I can acquire them, and
if I am just missing them, how can I get them?

Thanks,
Tom Christian

I seem to be different from most of the people on this list, in that:

  o I run 1.24r instead of 2.X
  o I don't know what I'm talking about.

That said, here's some questions about / problems with FVWM 1.24r that I'd
appreciate some advice on:

  1. I set up ImageMagick 3.7.3's `display` program to be part of a popup:

	Exec	"ImageMagick"			exec display &

     ...but when I try to launch it nothing happens. I've tried adding the
     full path to the executable, but it makes no difference. I can launch
     it fine from an xterm.

  2. Is it possible to have different foreground/background colors for
     specific window, via the Styles section? I do this for a window which
     contains a "root" command line:

       Style "God"		Icon bob2sml.xpm, Color red/black

     ...which sets the colors only when the window's not got the focus. I'd
     like for it to have a different set of colors when it's got the focus,
     too. (One more reminder that I'm executing commands as root, and not a
     normal user.)

A user I am helping has lost the ability to use her pager. I believe the 
problem is somewhere in her .fvwm2rc file, which I am including here, 
but for the life of me I can't find the error.

Any help greatly appreciated,

# Trying to compile an old .fvwrc to the  new fvwm-2.0 Format
# Unfortunately, order does matter in this file
# The correct order for inserting configurations is:
# 1. Colors
# 2. Assorted configuration paramters such as ClickToFocus, or MWMBorders
# 3. Path setup (ModulePath, PixmapPath, IconPath)
# 4. Style settings, including the default style Style "*" ...
# 5. InitFunction and ResetFunction definitions.
# 6. Other Functions. Functions cannot be forward referenced from
#	other functions, but they can be backward referenced.
# 7. Menus definitions. Same caveats about forward referencing
# 8. Key and Mouse Bindings.
# 9. Module options.

# The order of steps 5, 6, and 7 is not critical, as long as there are
# no forward references to functions or menus.

# If you get it wrong, the most common problem is that color or font settings
# are ignored

########################      ICON STUFF     ##############################
# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature....
# This creates two icon boxes, one on the left side, then one on the
# bottom. Leaves room in the upper left for my clock and xbiff,
# room on the bottom for the Pager.

# If you uncomment this, and make sure that the WindowList is bound to
# something, it works pretty much like an icon manager.
Style "*" NoIcon

# StubbornIcons makes icons de-iconify into their original position on the
# desktop, instead of on the current page.
#StubbornIcons

# With AutoPlacement, icons will normally place themselves underneath active

########################      MWM EMULATION     #######################
#
# My feeling is that everyone should use MWMDecorHints and MWMFunctionHints,
# since some applications depend on having the window manager respect them

# MWMFunction hints parses the function information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and prohibits use of these functions on the window. Appropriate
# portions of the window decorations are removed.
#MWMFunctionHints

# MWM is kinda picky about what can be done to transients, and it was keeping
# me from iconifying some windows that I like to iconify, so here's an
# over-ride that will allow me to do the operation, even tough the menu
# item is shaded out.
#MWMHintOverride

# MWMDecor hints parses the decoration information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and removes these decoratons from the window. This does not affect
# the functions that can be performed via the menus.
#MWMDecorHints

########################      WINDOW PLACEMENT     #######################
# RandomPlacement prevents user interaction while placing windows:

# SmartPlacement makes new windows pop-up in blank regions of screen

Style "*" SmartPlacement

# With SmartPlacement, windows will normally place themselves over icons. 
# Uncomment this to change that.

Hi Jamie

Aha, you're swallowing the pager. I'm going to assume you're using 2.0.42
because this happened to a lot of my users upgrading from 2.0.39. 

> *FvwmButtons(3x1) - 		NULL		SwallowModule Exec "FvwmPager" FvwmPager 0 2

You have to change 'SwallowModule Exec' to 'Swallow' here:

*FvwmButtons(3x1) -     whatever Swallow "Fvwm Pager" FvwmPager 0 2

There is a new (test) pixmap button patch for 2.0.42.  It needs
testing however.  Some minor drawing artifacts are done right now,
some new button styles are added.

You should be able to download it at:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/fvwm-2.0.42.pxp7.diff.gz

Please read the man page update contained in the patch for details.

Thanks,
Andrew

Hellow all,

I've tried to make fvwm-2.0.4[12] work on our HPs 715/50, running
"HP-UX gluon A.09.07 A 9000/715".

I compiled it using gcc version 2.7.2

The HP ANSI C compiler (HP92453-01 A.09.34 HP C Compiler) fails with
some errors.

The compilation using gcc goes just fine.

In order to test, I copied the sample fvwmrc2 to ~/.fvwmrc2 and start
stock X11R6.1 from MIT, exit twm and start fvwm2 from a xterm. Nothing
happens and the machine is apparently locked. Have to kill the X
server.

A diferent thing occurs if I already start X with fvwm2 as my window
manager. Then fvwm2 starts, the window frames are there, but no menus,
no buttons, no nothing. And my ~/.fvwmrc2 *is* there.

Any hint? Has anyone got fvwm-2.0.4[12] compiled using HPUX 9/gcc/HP C?

I'm sorry to say that I'm not subscribed to this list (yet), so please
drop me a mail.

Thanks for your time.

Emilio.

I'm a big fan of fvwm on my system at work (IBM RISC/6000 AIX 3.xxxx,
fvwm 1.x).  I'm running linux on a Pentium system at home and I'm having
trouble getting some parts of my work configuration to work at home.  

Most notably, I use key mappings similar to some discussed in the fvwm
mailing list archives to move about using the keypad:

Key KP_7  	A	CS	GotoPage 0 0
Key KP_8	A	CS	GotoPage 1 0
Key KP_9	A	CS	GotoPage 2 0
Key KP_4	A	CS	GotoPage 0 1
Key KP_5	A	CS	GotoPage 1 1
Key KP_6	A	CS	GotoPage 2 1
Key KP_1	A	CS	GotoPage 0 2
Key KP_2	A	CS	GotoPage 1 2
Key KP_3	A	CS	GotoPage 2 2

However, I haven't been able to get these mappings to work on either
fvwm 1.24 or fvwm 2.0.  I can get the GotoPage function to work when
mapped to another key, so I'm suspicious of my
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.  The relevant lines from this file are:

#define XK_KP_0			0xFFB0
#define XK_KP_1			0xFFB1
#define XK_KP_2			0xFFB2
#define XK_KP_3			0xFFB3
#define XK_KP_4			0xFFB4
#define XK_KP_5			0xFFB5
#define XK_KP_6			0xFFB6
#define XK_KP_7			0xFFB7
#define XK_KP_8			0xFFB8
#define XK_KP_9			0xFFB9

I don't completely understand what these lines represent.  Is it
possible that there is a mismatch between this file and my keyboard (an
early IBM 101 key keyboard originally from an XT-286)?

I am a nearly the latest linux kernal, but I'm probably a bit back level
on both fvwm versions.  

I can't think of anything else, which is, of course, why I'm asking.

Thanks in advance.

-Dave

Use xev to verify that the keys are mapped correctly.  If they are not,
you can remap them with xmodmap.

   A few days ago FvwmButtons stopped working for me.  It now quits

every time I try to start it, saying 'no buttons defined'.  I didn't
make any changes to my .fvwm2rc, and I've even tried going back to a
previous, known good .fvwm2rc.  I'm constantly changing other parts
of my system, but I reversed the only one I changed right before this
happened (kernel upgrade) with no effect.

   I'm recompiling and re-installing now.

   fvwm 2.0.42, Linux:  kernel pre2.0.7, libc 5.3.12, XFree86 3.1.2
(Mach8), Xpm 4.6

   Let me know what other information would be helpful.

This is becoming a very FAQ...and its not directly fvwm related.

I have a key on my Sun (type 5?) keyboard, beside the F keys,
with nothing on it (beside 'Help'). I'd like for it to be
'Lock Screen'. Running 'xev' shows it up as 'NoSymbol'.

This isn't the right keysym (or whatever the correct term is)
for fvwm obviously as it does not work. Question - what is the
correct way of finding the 'name' of that key?

Did you try xkeycaps to see if it knows what it is?  I would have
expected xev to work as well though...

Anyone out there using a Sun box w/ a type 5 keyboard have anything to
say?  Also, I remember some recent discussions on this list about the
Sun type 5 keyboards - try searching the archives for 'type 5' and see
if it comes back with anything relevant.

I imagine it would.  When I get a chance, I'll do it, but it may not
be before the first official release, as I have to start limiting what
new stuff goes in so I can actually get it out the door sometime
soon...

Hm.  Interesting.  I'll try and investigate this (it may be related to

anyways).

This was the right way to find out the name of that key.
Find out the number of the key (also using xev), then use the
following command in your .xinitrc or .xsession or whatever file:
xmodmap -e 'keycode 42 = bla'
Choose the right number (instead of 42), and choose a keysym that
actually exists (look at <X11/keysymdef.h> for those).

Not really, what's the problem? :)

It's certainly true that the key is unbound in "standard" X11 (I just
tried it with X11R6.1 on my Sun with a type 5 keyboard, and it's
"NoSymbol", or unbound).

But so what?  Just bind it to something and it'll work fine.  I used
xkeycaps to bind it to the symbol "Return" (I couldn't find a symbol
called "LockScreen" or variant anywhere), and voila!  Now I have two
return keys on my keyboard.

No big deal.

Well, I  have a type 4  keyboard, which also  has a "help" key.  "xev"
reports this:

KeyRelease event, serial 15, synthetic NO, window 0x6c00001,
    root 0x29, subw 0x2802783, time 3852912750, (109,112), root:(863,135),
    state 0x0, keycode 125 (keysym 0xff6a, Help), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

In which case fvwm would consider the key "Help".

If the key is not already doing this,  use xev or  xkeycaps to get the
keycode, and assign the keysym "Help" to it using xmodmap.

xkeycaps is even neater.  I've used it for my sun keyboard so that I can
use the normal cursor keys on it.

There is a new version of the title-bar patch available (for 2.0.42).
It has a new syntax and some new features.  There are also some new
pictures on the web page.

See for more info:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_title_picture.html

There are many changes, but it is still work-in-progess.  There are
special patching instructions (2 patches must be applied).  These
patches are for entertainment purposes only.

Among the changes, you can specify the title-bar height over
WindowFont default, attach the pixmap to one of the sides (or corners)
and more...  There is no need for this type patch into fvwm2, so it
will remain an add-on patch.

Report problems to me.

More is coming...

gallego>   "  - Switch from Imake to GNU autoconf?
gallego> What about that ?

It says all :-)

I've already posted a patches to this list twice (for version 1.?? and
version 2.0.??, sorry I forgot), which make fvwm to configure the OS
specific section (ex. use sysconf or not) with GNU autoconf.

But, IMHO (comes from the experiences of making patches),

a) Most of all applications for X use imake and that's maybe the way
   of X. There is no reason that fvwm denies this manner.

b) Switching to GNU autoconf is not suitable. Though GNU autoconf is
   great, imake knows ALL about development environment for X
   application and GNU autoconf (maybe) don't, sometimes mistake
   (That's the reason that patch for 1.xx was not included to fvwm).

c) Using imake and configure (yes, my patches do so) is tired :-)
   (We should run both 'configure' and 'xmkmf' before 'make')

We should carefully consider the usage of GNU configure to fvwm.

I agree.

BTW, the '?' at the end of those TO-DO list items generally indicates
"I don't know if this should or will actually be done or attempted,
but I plan to investigate when I get a chance" or some variation of
that theme.

I have both patches from Matsushita-san.  When I investigate, I'll use
those as starting points.

True.  The main reason I wanted to try autoconf is for those systems
that have messed up Imake config files or don't have it installed at
all (default for AIX and HPUX it seems).

I only intend to use it if it can seamlessly replace the Imake stuff
entirely.  When I investigate, I'll probably have some releases with
both methods of building in there, to flush out bugs and test all
system feasability.

The latest snapshot of tkgoodstuff at merv.philosophy.lsa.umich.edu
has a bunch of new stuff.  It's likely to have some problems, but it
works well in my use.  Thanks for any testing & reports!
Mark

(tkgoodstuff is a fancy button bar utility.)

4.1b7: (unreleased)

   There have been quite a few changes that are sure to introduce new
   bugs.  Please inform me of any troubles, providing as much
   information as you can about your platform, your .tkgrc, etc.

   - The latest tkgoodstuff and the latest CHANGES file is now
   available at the web site.

   - The GUI installation tool has been replaced by a GNU autoconf
   thing ("./configure" then "make", then "make install").  Probably
   there are still importabilities, so please let me know how it goes. 

   - The xpm and fvwm extensions are now wrapped into "libtkg", which
   is compiled and installed automatically at tkgoodstuff installation
   (this way you don't have to install, and I don't have to maintain,
   as many packages).  If someone wants to pull them apart and
   maintain them individually, be my guest.

   - If the Tcl installation doesn't support loadable libraries, we
   make and use tkgwish.  You can force this with 
   "configure --enable-tkgwish".  (Worth a try if the C compilation
   fails.)

   - The panel (including main panel) and menu configurations are now
   done with a point-and-click, drag-and-drop hierarchical list widget
   with little icons to make you feel safe-and-secure.  It's harder to
   screw up your configuration or menu now (or it should be when the
   bugs get ironed out).  

   - The image+text tkgbutton code is now done in C (and is part of
   libtkg).  This simplifies and speeds up various things.

   - Dragging a (screenedge mode) main panel (by its border) to other
   edges of the screen now works without restarting tkgoodstuff.  If
   you have used the defaults, the arrangement of icons, labels, etc,
   changes to suit the new orientation.

   - No more "Dismiss" buttons in panels produced by PanelButtons, 
   since they can be dismissed by clicking on the PanelButton.

   - Clock now shows time only by default, and toggles to show the
   date temporarily when the mouse pointer enters the clock window.

   - The tkgoodstuff menu now can be used anywhere in the Menu client
   menu as a cascade (before it would pop up oddly).  Also, for now
   there is only one Menu client menu (anyone sorely miss having 3?).

   - We take advantage of the /proc filesystem (e.g., on Linux):
     + Load now reads /proc/loadavg if it exists (and otherwise exec's
       uptime).
     + Net now by default reads /proc/net/route if it exists (and
       otherwise exec's ifconfig).

4.1b6: 4/30/96

   - There is a new on-line preferences manager (so you don't have to
   edit the rc file by hand). Start up tkgoodstuff.  You will get a
   default configuration.  Select Preferences from the tkgoodstuff
   menu, and choose the "Configuration" section.  Here, add, delete or
   move Client, AddButton, AddLabelBox, stacking, and panel-creating
   commands.  Then, save the preferences and restart.  Now you can set
   using the preferences manager the things you used to have to adjust
   with variables.

   - tkgoodstuff: 

       + New options for icon scale and font scale (small or large).
       Also, where an iconfile is called for, you can specify
       "%biffnew" and tkgoodstuff will look, depending on whether the
       scale is small or large, for biffnew.xpm or biffnew-sm.xpm.

       + New option for standard padding inside buttons, etc.  Adjust
       to 0 for very busy but compact look, to 2 or 3 for more roomy
       look.

       + Now you can specify a pathlist of icon directories
       in the preferences manager.  You also can specify an icon that
       is somewhere in that path with just its name (full filenames
       work too).

       + In fullscreen mode, now you can "drag" the main border to
       move the panel to another edge of the screen.  It's a quick
       hack (if we go from horizontal to vertical or vice versa we
       save a changed fullscreen-side preference and restart
       tkgoodstuff), but nothing wouldn't be better.  We should really
       be able to do this on the fly (which means regridding, and
       resizing the auto-sized clients (Clock, Pager, Load).

       + Also there is a new option Auto-minimize which in fullscreen
       mode reduces tkgoodstuff to a line along the edge of the screen
       when the mouse leaves the tkgoodstuff panel.

       + Killed (I hope) bug without understanding why: sometimes in
       auto-minimize mode clicking on a panelbutton would cause an
       error whose entire stack trace is ("after" script).  Since
       removing an "update" command from TKGPanelButtonInvoke, I no
       longer see this problem.  Any speculations as to why would be
       welcome!

   - New Client: TkMan, by G. Dezern, interfaces with the tkman man
   page viewer the way our WWW client interfaces with web browsers.

   - WindowList: Shorten windownames before using scrollbar (patch
   from E. Kahler).

   - Biff: 
     + Mail-checking methods now work as advertised (thanks R. Angiel
     and G. Dezern).  I hope.
     + Optional on-button display of number of new messages (except
     for users of the mh method).  (Thanks R. Angiel.)
     + Display of new messages was too fancy, or not fancy enough, to
     work right; now we just display the entire header with the message.
     + MH method much, much improved thanks to G. Dezern.
     + Multiple mailbox support thanks to G. Dezern.

   - Net:
     + Added elapsed-time-of-connection counter.
     + Deleted net-type from label.

   - Jots and Calc: respond sensibly to window manager DELETEs.

   - Icons: ruthless color-pruning.  Now the icons use colors from a
   palette of 19 colors, and tkgoodstuff's default widget colors are
   among them. 

   - tkxpm and tkfvwm: much tidier configure scripts (not using
   autoconf), relying on tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh.  Also, fvwm
   source is no longer needed to compile tkfvwm (libfvwm2.a is now
   installed at fvwm installation).  M. Beynon contributed bug fixes.

4.1b5: 2/27/96

  Now tkgoodstuff assumes tk4.1b1 or later (we're aiming at supporting
  the ultimate 4.1 release, and backward compatibility is too much
  work). 

     - tkgoodstuff: 

       + We use the grid geometry manager rather than pack for almost
       everything.  TKGPack is superseded by TKGGrid.  Had hoped that
       this would make fullscreen mode easier, but no.

       + Added subpanels which are formed with StartPanel and
       EndPanel, can be linked to a button with PanelButton, or placed
       on the screen at startup with PutPanel.  See the tkgoodstuffrc
       html docs for more.

       + Now xpm capability is mandatory.  I hope Ioi Lam's xpm image
       type will get in the core before our main 4.1 release.

       + "create-label-box" renamed to "TKGLabelBox".  NOTE!!!

       + AddButton and AddLabelBox no longer take a name as first
       argument.  NOTE!!!

       + Clock_zerotrim moved to tkgoodstuff and called TKGZeroTrim.

       + Use "ps -p [pid]" if "ps [pid]" gives an error, and don't
       assume there's a STAT column in the ps output (thanks
       J. Robinson).

       + Implement TKGAddToHook and TKGDoHook (general hook
       utilities).  Several hooks are defined (for client use) in
       tkgoodstuff, Fvwm.tcl, etc.

       + Change default fonts to non-italic, non-bold.

     - Biff: avoid tcl7.5b1's gets bugs by not doing "gets $f var".

     - New client "Pager" by Eric Kahler.  Check out the current
     version in this distribution.  Needs tkgoodstuff to be run as an
     fvwm module (from the fvwm window manager).

     - New client "Chooser" by Eric Kahler.  Pops up a window at
     startup to let you choose among different tkgoodstuff
     configuration files.

     - New client in "alpha" stage: Calc (dec/hex/oct calculator).
     Has paper-tape-like scrollable history.  Some features not
     implemented, but it's fairly usable.  I'm not inclined to develop
     this further right now, so I'd be very happy if someone were to
     adopt it.

     - New client in "beta" stage: Webster (net dictionary client).
     Pops up a definition of the word you highlight (the current X
     selection).  Can use unix "webster" command, but also has its own
     internal webster client code (using the new Tcl socket stuff,
     with a kludge required because Tcl strings can't yet contain
     NULLs).

     - The tkfvwm source is now included in the tkgoodstuff
     distribution.

     - The fvwm WindowList feature has become a client.  To call it,
     you now issue "Client WindowList".  It's become more robust too,
     I hope.  I also added a few default icons for shells, editors,
     mailers, newsreaders.  If it doesn't recognize your favorite
     apps of these types, please let me know the resource Class name,
     and the application type (e.g., "Xmh" is a mailer, "XTerm" is a
     shell). I'd be happy to have some graphically competent person revise
     these or submit other 11x11 icons.

     - Fvwm: fvwm's messages are more easily available to clients, we
     maintain a more complete database of the information available
     from fvwm, and we slightly enhanced tkfvwm (the new version of
     tkfvwm4.1 is needed to take advantage of all the information).
     Look at Fvwm.tcl for more info.  These changes were primarily to
     support WindowList and Eric Kahler's cool Pager client.

     - Clock, Ical, Jots: use the new "clock" command instead of "exec
     date". 

     - Ical: Gave one alarm per item per calendar fetch.  Oops.  Stick
     to one per item.

     - Jots: Made widgets behave sensibly under manual resizing (until
     tk4.1b1's empty-frame bug showed up, that is).

     - Net: (bug) call TKGButton, not TKGMakeButton, to change the
     text on a switch of net types.  Also, (feature removal) don't
     bind mouse <3> to change Net_type (too confusing for those who
     don't want it and don't want to know about it, and it's easy
     enough to change types with the popup menu).

(Earlier changes available on request.)

Imake doesn't know all about the development environment.  It knows about
the development environment that the OS vendor thinks you should have.
After all, everyone buys a commercial compiler from the OS vendor rather
than using GCC, right? :-)

Autoconf uses Imake if it is available to find relevent information such
as locations of libraries and include files and the names of any special
libraries that might be needed, but it doesn't make any assumptions about
what compiler you have installed.   Autoconf checks for itself to find
your compiler and much other system-specific information.  I think this is
the better solution.

Tony.

Sorry I'm not familiar with autoconf, Does autoconf uses the
informaiton of $XTOP/lib/config ? or simply kicks imake to use ?

***

Maybe the best (ie, easy, reliable, and portable) procedure of fvwm
compilation is:

1) Edit configulation file to specify the features (XPM and so on).
	It should be included to step 2) ?
2) do './configure'.
	Configure makes Imakefile, and do 'xmkmf', 'make Makefiles',
	and so on ('xmkmf -a' is enough ?).
3) do 'make'.
	**/Makefile is already generated by imake.
4) do 'make install'
	Wow, it's happy :-)

Any comments ?

The configure script generated by autoconf creates a very simple Imakefile
and then it runs xmkmf and looks at the generated Makefile to get the
following variables (these are on my linux system, they will differ):

ac_im_incroot="/usr/X11R6/include";
ac_im_usrlibdir="/usr/X11R6/lib";
ac_im_libdir="/usr/X11R6/lib/X11"

Then it isn't so foolish to assume that these are the actual locations, it
checks to make sure.  If these aren't the correct locations, then it
continues to look in a bunch of common places to find the real libraries
and includes.

This can be done on the command line with autoconf. i.e.
./configure --with-xpm

It can also optionally be done manually in configure.h

> 2) do './configure'.

Just have configure make the Makefiles.  Imake shouldn't be needed.

> 3) do 'make'.
> 4) do 'make install'

I have had plenty of problems trying to get Imake to work properly on
commercial Unixes (Solaris and HPUX) where it is the goal of the OS vendor
to force you to buy their development environment.  HPUX doesn't even come
with Imake, and once you find it and install it, it is set up to use HP's
compiler (which isn't included) and it sets up the CFLAGS with a bunch of
non-standard compiler switches.  At least Solaris comes with Imake, but
again it is set up for the commercial compiler.

I have had varying degrees of success with using options to imake i.e.
something like:
imake -DHASGCC=YES
(I don't remember the exact syntax) but nothing compares to a well-written
autoconf setup.

Tony.

I am using fvwm95 and fvwm2 and have several questions.

Some relevant settings to below:

ClickTime 300
Style "*" ClickToFocus

1. If do the following:

Mouse 3        T     A      Lower

it works OK when the window is on top, but if it is not, 
the window will be raised first and then lowered. This seems to be caused
by ClickToFocus.

Two more things about Lower.
  1. Lowered windows seem to stick to the bottom of z-order
     until I raise them again, is there a way around it.

  2. How do I set the focus to topmost window after Lower. I 
     experimented with Next and Prev, without success.


2. Is there a way to position menus from FvwmButtons, like FvwmTaskBar can do?

Regards,
Mark

I suggest you be more familar with autoconf before you slam it.

I agree entirely. I compile programs for 6 platforms (SunOS, Solaris, OSF,
HPUX, AIX, Ultrix) and Autoconf'd programs, both X and non-X, almost always
compile straight out of the tar file for all platforms. The same cannot be
said for programs that use Imake.

[Lots of good things about autoconf]

I agree completely with Anthony. One more point in favor of
autoconf. Since you write the skeleton of the Makefile(s), it is by
design human readable. This means that, unlike imake-generated
Makefiles, you can hack them if something goes wrong.

Concerning setting up correctly imake, it can be very difficult to do
on some proprietary systems and versions of X11. It is better to fix
fvwm once than to tell a bunch of people to fix their setup.

GNU autoconf decides libraries and files are exists. Suppose directories
/usr/local/X11R5 and /usr/local/X11R6 are both exist, GNU autoconf can
decide "which version of X to use" ? With imake, you can easily decide
with using which imake (/usr/local/X11R5/bin or /usr/local/X11R6/bin)
is suitable.

Auto detection is great, and GNU autoconf does well I know, but GNU
autoconf is not flexible when a user want to setup a little bit tricky...

That's right, but there is no reason to avoid this problem. How about
providing imake environment for HP-UX ? (I heard somebody already
makes this) or providing Packaged Solaris binaries of GCC ? (I heard
this also) ?

Using GNU autoconf is easy, but I think it's not a true solution to
this problem, just a escape...

todd> To a better solution.

If you say so, why not making GNU autoconf configulation for fvwm ?

Using configure is paradise, light use of autoconf is well, and making
cool configure script by autconf is just a nightmare... That's my experience.

hi, all

i have a wierd problem that seems to be the fault of fvwm.  i'm using
v2.0.42, btw.  anyway, using netscape 2 (or above), i can open the
Bookmarks window to see the list of my bookmarks.  no problem.  however,
when i select Properties from the Item menu, the Properties box appears,
but then gets shoved right behind the Bookmarks window.  this doesn't
happen on the other WMs i've used, mainly 4Dwm on SGI.  

it's a minor thing, but i'd like things to behave rationally.  anyone know
what's going on here? 

thanks,
greg

Hi Folks

First off, thanks to Rasmus Tamstorf and Chuck for letting me know that
my posts are making it to the list.

Here's some more data points on the none.xpm/Iconify anomaly.

fvwm 2.0.42 on Irix 6.2.

I'm using the following sort of thing:

Style "*"       Icon none.xpm, SmartPlacement, NoPPosition
Mouse 2         I       A       Iconify

On the mouse 2 event in an iconified window it is de-iconified but
not raised, i.e. it comes up *under* all other windows on the screen. If I
use real pixmaps instead it is always raised as well.

I have got around it by using the following function instead:

Mouse 2         I       A       Iconify-and-Raise

AddToFunc Iconify-and-Raise     "I" Iconify
+                               "I" Raise

This works fine.

Lemme see:

autoconf:  override with command line switches
imake:     totally re-install and re-configure to get it to work properly

You tell me which is more flexible.

it to the equivelent of the Autoconf:

  ./configure --exec-prefix=/tools/app/fred-1.2 \
              --prefix=/tools/share/app/fred-1.2

When you have multiple platforms, the need to conserve disk space, and the
ability to easily back out of new versions of an application, the above
sort of configuration is needed.

I have found that with most Imake configured programs they insist in
installing directly into your X11 directories, which on our systems
are not writeable by normal users. 
I think a big problem with Imake'd programs is that they don't come with
documentation on how to configure installation locations etc (Fvwm is a
noteable exception here :-) whereas Autoconf one do.

I tried it and it happens to me too on twm-based wm's: fvwm, bowman, twm, ctwm.
It's OK on mwm-based wm's: mwm, 4Dwm.

Just a sec while I whoosh over to a Solaris box ... umm, doesn't work
right under olwm either. 

Using:

Style "*"           SmartPlacement, NoPPosition, HintOverride
Style "*"           MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, MWMBorder
Style "*"           DecorateTransient
Style "Netscape*"   Sticky, SmartPlacement

on fvwm-2.0.42, Irix 6.2.

If you check the release notes of Netscape 2.0, this is listed as a
known problem on certain platforms. It is not caused by fvwm.

Many thanks to those who pointed me in the right direction with
xev/xmodmap to enable me to use a previously unbound key for an
fvwm function.

I now have the 'blank' key bound like this in my .xinitrc:
xmodmap -e 'keycode 22 = SunPowerSwitch'

I then went to get fvwm to use that as 'Lock Screen':
Key SunPowerSwitch    A       N       Exec "" xlock -mode random &

The thing is (I feel so stupid), this doesn't work! Now, as far as I can
see this is correct.

When I hit the key the console pops up with this error message:
/bin/sh:

Anyone got any idea why this should be? Its bound to be something 
silly. Thanks very much.

ObRequest:
	(a) StartsOnPage - honestly, this'd be very handy! I wouldn't have to:
		(i) Spend a few minutes moving windows out onto other pages
			after every login.
		(ii) Mess about with silly functions just to get windows where I
			want them. Its not worth the mess, and then I have to
			watch the mapping and so on.
	(Yes, I'm gonna keep asking over and over!)

Try putting the complete path to xlock there.  Maybe xlock isn't in

Right!  Since we install all of our net-contrib'd X software in
`non-standard' places (i.e. not /usr/openwin/bin on Solaris), one of
the first things I had to do is copy all the OpenWindows imake config
files and hack them up so they'd reflect our environment.  Now that
I've done this, most X programs build fairly painlessly.

I think it is too tired :-) Editing *akefile and execute appropriate
command of what you want. It's simple :-)

Somebody says GNU configure is flexible because of command-line
option, but it's unflexible because of command-line ONLY. Editing
*akefile after 'sh ./configure' is out of the questions :-)

Using GNU configure as a default is easy. But it's less
flexible when we want to use 'site specific' setup.

I am new to this mailing list (and to this WM) so I may be asking a basic
question. I couldn't find the answer in the FAQ and on any other online docs.

I am looking for a way to set Icons one after the other (say from Top left
to the Top right). For now, every time a window is being Iconify the icon
appear on a random position on the desktop (near the mouse).

Any setting ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Yehuda.

Hi !

    I do not know whether this is a proper place to ask this question.

I am trying to build fvwm2.0.42 on Sun SPARC 20 Solaris 2.4 (With Apogee compiler)
I wanted to build it with XPM support. 
So first I built the libXpm-4.7 ( I got it from ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries )

Then I edited the Fvwm.tmpl file for HasXpm ...

The fvwm2 builds completely without error but if you introduce a pixmap button. 
I am getting error saying fvwm must have Xpm support.

I am stuck at this point.

Please Help...

Yours

The thing to do is leave the system config files in place, make a copy
of the config directory into someplace you can edit, then also copy
xmkmf (it's just a script, at least under OpenWindows) so that it uses
the new config files by default.  Then make sure your xmkmf is earlier
in your path.

But you are definitely right that imake config files, and the
generated Makefiles are not humanly readable. :-)  Hacking those
config files is a major pain.

Of Course. If you are too tired to use these commands each time, you
can place all the assignments you want in the file config.site, which
will be read by all programs using autoconf. You might argue that it
is as difficult as fixing imake, but I see several advantages:

- you have the choice to use command line or config.site.  

- this will work for non-X programs too.  

- it is much easier to do: once you have found the right options for
  configure, have a look into config.cache and cut and paste the right
  lines in /usr/local/etc/config.site (there are also other places
  that are searched for). That's it!

I use the WinList module a lot and notice that it's position
changes by one pixel every time its size changes (gain or lost
of an icon).  The offending line seems to be 239 of FvwmWinList.c:

        if (win_border!=0) win_border++;

I *do* keep a border around my WinList (that's how I noticed it).

Removing this line keeps WinList from creeping off the edge of
the screen over time.  Does this line of code serve some purpose
that I am missing?  Or is it a bug?

Thanks,
-alf

As long as the discussion is on startup files, as a sysadmin, I like to
give my users a default environment that they can further customize.

The way this usually works is that people copy the system default file
to their own directory, then edit it like crazy.  

Often the problem is that the default changes.  E.g. suppose I want to
replace xterm with xtm.  I'd like to do this only once inthe system
default file.

After a couple of years of this, we have 113 different user
environments, which stiffles communication between users.

With tcsh, my default user shell, the shell sources /etc/csh.login,
/etc/csh.cshrc ~/.login and ~/.cshrc.  So changes that are put in the
first two act as globabl changes, which users can choose to overwrite.

How difficult would it be with fvwm for it to read system.fvwmrc, AND
~/.fvwmrc?

Sure... as long as you always want to put them in the same place.  What
if you want to put them into _different_ places?  Do you have to go back
and hack up the config files again?  How do you handle switching back
and forth?

I sometimes want to install imake-based apps into the X release
directory, and sometimes into our "global" contrib software directory,
and sometimes other places (our source tree, perhaps, if it's a tool or
something).  It's next to impossible to do this with imake.  I've posted
many queries for help and guidance to the X newsgroups, and received
many "me-too" responses, but as of yet I have not received one _single_
suggestion on a solution.

Imake is dated, crufty technology that's marginally useful for building
X... period.  IMHO of course :)

I'd prefer it if X went to autoconf too: autoconf has one GIGANTIC
advantage over imake that basically makes this entire conversation
silly: autoconf gracefully handles building source for multiple
architectures at the same time, without conflict.  I always do this with
all autoconf packages:

  $ tar xofz package-500.tar.gz
  $ cd package-500
  $ mkdir _sun4
  $ cd _sun4
  $ ../configure --prefix=/usr/global
  $ make

Then, I login to my HP, and do this:

  $ cd package-500
  $ mkdir _hp9
  $ cd _hp9
  $ ../configure --prefix=/usr/global
  $ make

all at the same time, of course.

With imake, I have to build for one, install, clean, then build for the
next, install, clean, etc.  If I find a problem with the first one, I
have to clean out the current one, rebuild everything over.  With
autoconf, I have all the architectures there already built; I just
recompile the one file that changed and relink.

X's symbolic link farm solution is crufty at _best_, and only works with
X--it doesn't translate automatically to all packages which use imake.

(To be fair, it can be tricky writing your autoconf Makefile.in to work
with the multi-architecture feature correctly if you're not familiar
with VPATH, but at least it's supported and there are lots of good
examples).

Uhh... really, really NOT! :)

What do I edit?  Who knows?  The Imakefile just says
"InstallSimpleCommand()" or some such thing.  No path, no nothing.

What if I want to install it somewhere else?  What if I want it to build
with an install path of /foo/bar, but when I run install I want to stage
it into a directory /local/beta/foo before actually installing it (I do
this all the time)?

    mm> Somebody says GNU configure is flexible because of command-line

    mm> *akefile after 'sh ./configure' is out of the questions :-)

Why?  Makefiles generated by autoconf are trivial to edit for changes
like this--a far sight simpler than editing a postprocessed imake
Makefile, no doubt about that!  Imake generates makefiles with 10 pages
of boilerplate stuff at the beginning, and you can't tell which variable
to change for which path: there seem to be two or more for every
purpose.  I'm constantly searching back and forth through the makefile
trying to figure out where variables got their values from and which one
I should change.

Then half the time the actual make rules at the bottom of the makefile
don't even use the boilerplate variables!  And when they do, they often
use the same variable for so many different things that you can't get it
to do what you want.

With imake, about 70% of the time I end up thinking it'd be easier to
just write my own makefile, and I sometimes do.  With autoconf, I can't
remember _ever_ thinking that, much less doing it.

Autoconf makefiles all have a nice little section at the top like this:

  # Common prefix for machine-independent installed files.
  prefix = /usr/global
  # Common prefix for machine-dependent installed files.
  exec_prefix = ${prefix}

  # Directory to install in.
  bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
  # Directory to install the Info files in.
  infodir = $(prefix)/info
  # Directory to install the man page in.
  mandir = $(prefix)/man/man$(manext)
  # Number to put on the man page filename.
  manext = 1

Everything is based off of $(prefix).  Trivial to change the entire
thing by resetting $(prefix), or you can tweak them individually for
greater flexibility.

I usually just override them on the make command line.  E.g., to do what
I mentioned above and stage the installation is trivial:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/foo/bar
  $ make
  $ make install prefix=/local/beta/foo

Done.  I never even bother to _look_ at the makefile.  Plus, autoconf
packages come with some darn documentation (the INSTALL file); almost no
imake packages tell you how to customize the install directories, etc.

    mm> Using GNU configure as a default is easy. But it's less
    mm> flexible when we want to use 'site specific' setup.

I couldn't disagree more.  Imake is unfriendly, inflexible, confusing,
difficult to use even in the simple case, impossible to use for more
complex cases, and _way_ to big and complex for what you get (who needs
all that for a few simple pathname settings and a compiler name for
pity's sake?  Autoconf actually _works_ for its money, producing a
customized config.h file or whatever :)

Autoconf has its problems, but it's far and away the very best choice
out there.

Go ahead, ask me how I _really_ feel! :)

Right on.

I can only tip my hat to the folks who say imake is usable.  I have
tried and tried to get to where I could even understand how to use it,
much less understand what's really going on.  No effin' way.  Sorry.

This is why configure takes the options --x-includes=DIR and
--x-libraries=DIR so that you can manually override configure.  Yes,
autoconf/configure is quite flexible.  And in the above example, configure
would choose the imake that comes first in your path, so if this is not
what you want, then just override it with the command-line options to
configure.

Another titlebar patch is available.  See bottom for location.

** Changes:

- refinements to cleanly compile out when undefined (i.e. defining
XPM, PIXMAP_BUTTONS, PIXMAP_TITLEBARS)... some minor cleanups
elsewhere...

- * additional style for title bar for Solid and FullSolid, which give
the title-bar a solid color.. also these can be used even *without*
XPM support, PIXMAP_BUTTONS or PIXMAP_TITLEBARS

- context diff (I saw the light :), so you shouldn't need GNU patch
anymore.. *plus* this is a *single* patch to fvwm-2.0.42 instead of a
two step patch

** Location (I hope I get this right :):

Patch is at:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/fvwm-2.0.42.tbp3.diff.gz
(~8k)

Please check the page for updates though at:

as always please report problems to me,

I have a trouble in compiling fvwm95-2.0.41f.

I guess the package of fvwm95 lacks for module/FvwmConfig though
it seems to need them. What can I do?

#Ofcourse I've already installed fvwm2.0.42.

Sherwood Botsford:
> How difficult would it be with fvwm for it to read system.fvwmrc, AND
> ~/.fvwmrc?

I've been hacking together a system.fvwmrc that has enough hooks that
a user or sysadmin can customize it as they wish, but which does not require
modifying the original file.  

A trimmed down version is:

	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/pre.hook
	Read .fvwm2/pre.hook

	... various settings that can later be overridden ...

	DestroyMenu InitFunction
	AddToFunc InitFunction
	+ "I" Exec /etc/X11/fvwm2/setup-background
	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/init.hook
	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/init-restart.hook
	Read .fvwm2/init.hook
	Read .fvwm2/init-restart.hook

	DestroyMenu RestartFunction
	AddToFunc RestartFunction
	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/restart.hook
	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/init-restart.hook
	Read .fvwm2/restart.hook
	Read .fvwm2/init-restart.hook

	DestroyMenu MainMenu
	AddToMenu MainMenu
	+ "Main menu"		Title 	
	+ "XTerm"		Exec xterm
	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/main-menu.hook
	Read .fvwm2/main-menu.hook
	+ ""			Nop
	+ "Exit Fvwm"		Menu Quit-Verify

	... winops/quit-verify menus, mouse and key bindings, functions ...

	Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/post.hook
	Read .fvwm2/post.hook

Notes:

o	most user added stuff is meant to be put into post.hook, except for
	main menu extensions, which go into main-menu.hook

o	every hook is duplicated for both sysadmin and user; user hooks
	override admin hooks

o	setup-background looks for a background.{gif,xpm,jpg,color} file
	and shows it if it finds it (i.e., the user does not have to
	write a command to it, copying the image into .fvwm2 is enough);
	it's a simple shell script, and relies on some external tools
	(xpmroot, xloadimage)
	
o	my admin setup automatically creates a /etc/X11/fvwm2/main-menu.hook 
	that contains Applications and Games submenus, with entries for the
	installed programs (I will try to get Debian Linux developers support
	this, so that each package executes a command to automatically add
	a program to the menus when installed, and removes it when 
	uninstalled); however, this is not part of the basic extensible 
	system.fvwmrc thing under discussion here
	
o	my personal user setup adds CD and Communications submenus

Further ideas:

o	some way to override /etc/X11/fvwm2/main-menu.hook; possibly
	beginning .fvwm2/main-menu.hook with the following might work
	well enough:
	
		DestroyMenu MainMenu
		AddToMenu MainMenu
		+ "XTerm" Exec xterm
		... user's own entries here
		
o	some really simple ways to change colors, background, and some
	other simple configuration stuff, preferably with a GUI interface

Questions:

o	am I correct if I assume that the order in which statements occur
	in config files no longer matter?

o	would it be good if something like it were put into the standard 
	distribution?
	
o	anyone want to test it on real users?

Change line 356 of fvwm/fvwm.c to add:
  ExecuteFunction("Read system.fvwmrc", NULL, &Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction(config_command, NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);

(just a quick thought, by no means tested...but you get the idea..)

Oh really?  Then what the heck do you call that?  Non-site-specific?

Personally, I am setting up a set of makefiles that when I type
'make packagename' it will download, uncompress, compile, and install
stuff without a single other lift of the finger.

I know, I'm lazy, but hey, isn't that was make is for?

Anyway, I have found it tons easier to give configure command line options
for where I want to install stuff.  Things done with imake I have had
to edit makefiles per application, figure out where it's install
prefix is if there is such a beast in a variable, and perhaps supply my
auto-mated compiler with a patch for the makefile if there isn't.

To me it is tons easier to just do:

./configure --prefix=/abc/software/fvwm-2.0.42/Linux

and then

./configure --prefix=/abc/software/fvwm-2.0.42/solaris

rather than:

cd /abc/software/fvwm-2.0.42/Linux/src/fvwm-2.0.42 
patch -p1 < /abc/software/fvwm.linux.patch
MakeMakefiles

and then

cd /abc/software/fvwm-2.0.42/solaris/src/fvwm-2.0.42 
patch -p1 < /abc/software/fvwm.solaris.patch
MakeMakefiles

And pray that nobody changes the Fvwm.tmpl file, so I don't have
to manually redo the patches.

I think it is becoming quite clear what is an easier solution.

I'm not sure if this is a problem with our system configuration or a
problem with the existing setup of Imake.  Unfortunately, I know very
little about the development of Imakefiles.

Anyway. . . . if I set my CFLAGS in Fvwm.tmpl

i.e.

#define FvwmCompiler cc
#define FvwmCompilerFlags +O2 -Ae

The CFLAGS variable in the Makefile gets overwritten and no longer
includes the DEFINES (like -DXPM -DSHAPE, etc).

ANYWAY. . . . I spent all day today trying to figure out why
when I set HasXpm to YES I wasn't getting XPM support.

Does anyone else have this problem or should I inform my system
administrator that there might be a problem with our Imake configuration?

-Alan

Hi,

I'm using fvwm 2.0.42 and I've found a problem that you all probably
already know about that.

The following files in the fvwm subdir should be compiled with the
XPM_DEFINES and XPM_INCLUDES passed to the C compiler, but this does
not happen:

borders.c
builtins.c
colors.c
functions.c
fvwm.c
icons.c
menus.c
read.c

The only thing I changed from the original distribution was the
Fvwm.tmpl, which I include after the signature.

I've sent a message to majordomo a few minutes ago, so I think it's
save if you reply to the list.

Emilio.

That's funny. I've just sent a mail to the list reporting this
problem. 

Exactly the same problem.

We have here HP's 715/50 running HP-UX 9.07 and MIT X11R6.1 (including
Imake).

I want configure to detect which X is used by automatically :-)

Well, the point that I want NOT to use GNU autoconf is "Writing
appropriate configure.in and/or related stuff (to make configure
configure script) is difficult than writing appropriate Imakefile". I
want NOT to force all developer who want to contribute/write a module
for fvwm.

Though configure script is maybe flexible and usable, why only a few
application (except the GNU product) uses GNU autoconf for generating ?
I think many developer want NOT to use GNU autoconf because of difficulty...

This is a known problem when setting compiler flags and Chuck said he
fixed it a while ago [for next release].  Search for CFLAGS in
Fvwm.tmpl and change it to CDEBUGFLAGS and you will be fine.

It will... it automatically uses the info for the X that's first in your
path variables.  Same as xmkmf.

Yes, you have a point.  Writing an autoconf configure script is probably
more difficult for a developer than a a simple Imakefile, although
straightforward autoconf environments aren't very complex, really: just
use the samples that come with autoconf... I wrote one for a project of
mine in a few hours, and that was autoconf 1.0 or some such.  It's a lot
better now.

But let's be honest, where do we really want the ease-of-use to come?
For the developer, who is one person and does it once, or for each of
the users, who will do it thousands of times (cumulatively)?

Obviously we'd rather the developer spent a little extra time to save
all the users a lot of heart- and headache.

Once the basic modules are autoconf'd, I can't believe that adding a new
one would be tough at all.  All the modules will use the config.h
generated by the main fvwm configure, rather than re-running configure
themselves, so it's just a matter of copying another module's
Makefile.in and tweaking it... and probably just a variable or two would
change.

    mm> Though configure script is maybe flexible and usable, why only a
    mm> few application (except the GNU product) uses GNU autoconf for

    mm> autoconf because of difficulty...

That may be one reason (although I think those developers are not
looking at the big picture if that's their sole reason).

Another might be that people writing X apps find it easier to use X's
config.  I don't see hardly any non-X apps using imake, really.

The most telling is probably that imake has been around a lot longer and
has a larger presence than autoconf: there're books about it and some
vendors ship system config files by default.  People know about it.

That's no reason to continue using it, though; if that were everyone's
attitude we'd not be using FVWM now :)

Anyway, I think we've beat this subject into the ground.  Cheers :)

Hmm, autoconf generated configure is intended to test for features.
For example the absence of getwd, if the system supports shared
libraries, if the system has an ansi c compiler and so on.

This requires that the developer adapts to it ie he/she needs
to use a number of #ifdefs for example.

This would not be necessry if libfvwm provides all modules
with an homogen interface or proxies for functions missing
in the system for example getwd.

The main stumble is ususally signals and its different interfaces.
SunOS4 supports for example both systemV and BSD.
Solaris 2.4 is POSIX and so on.

I am using fvwm95 and fvwm2 and have several questions.

Some relevant settings to below:

ClickTime 300
Style "*" ClickToFocus

1. If do the following:

Mouse 3        T     A      Lower

it works OK when the window is on top, but if it is not, 
the window will be raised first and then lowered. This seems to be caused
by ClickToFocus.

Two more things about Lower.
  1. Lowered windows seem to stick to the bottom of z-order
     until I raise them again, is there a way around it.

  2. How do I set the focus to topmost window after Lower. I 
     experimented with Next and Prev, without success.


2. Is there a way to position menus from FvwmButtons, like FvwmTaskBar can do?

Regards,
Mark

Well, it takes the xmkmf which is the first on the path. This is a
good way to find the good X.

Once the main configure script is written, it can generated a file
Make.rules which contains all the variables parts of the setup. Then
the developper of a module only has to write a module containing a few
lines (mostly the list of object files...).

Well, X applications use imake because we were told it is the right
thing to do. However, I maintain a configure script for an X
application (LyX, a word processor written in C++) and it works well.

FvwmConfig have been removed from the distribution since Fvwm95-2.0.41e,
so there should not be any problem with Fvwm95-2.0.41f (I didn't tried
this version yet, sorry).

I was using a friend's desktop with olvwm the other day,
and I noticed it did a cool idea with the resize code.

When you double click the title bar, it maximizes to full
height.  I can do the same with fvwm.  You can then resize
it from there to another size.  I can also do this with
fvwm.  However, with olvwm, at this point you can double
click the title bar and go back to the 1st shape/size/position.
I can't with fvwm.

Comments?

does fvwm2 do a cd $HOME on startup?

I found this one in a startup script of our sysadmin:

# .fvwmrc assumes to be in the users home directory
cd $HOME            
# start in background, so runx is still in control and can handle
# the cleanup procedure
$WINDOWMANAGER

this implies that fvwm doesn't and mwm - we used to use this one, before I
brought fvwm three years ago :-) - does a cd before reading any config
scripts.

what does fvwm2 do ?

short of hacking system startup scripts, I have to ask the 'roots' among
you ;^),

If you use the FvwmButton Respawn option, when the pager restarts
itself, it still says the windows is where you dropped it when you
killed the pager, so apparantly the window is really there, but
something is losing track of it.

My friend this morning found a possible bug in the Iconify/Move
relationship and the Pager.

Do the following. . . . 

	Iconify a Window (ie xterm)
	Move the icon around on the desktop.
	
At this point, the icon disappears from the desktop, but the Pager
still lists the window as where you dropped it.

Now, move the mini-window in the pager.  It will die.

We are running HP-UX 9.05 and I believe we linked against X11R5, but we
have R4,R5,R6 installed.

Can anyone duplidate this behavior?

A better question is why only a few X applications use GNU autoconf.
Here's a few X applications that do use autoconf:

   xarchie, xsession, ImageMagic, gimp, jpeg library, xshisen

> I think many developer want NOT to use GNU autoconf because of difficulty...

But autoconf isn't difficult.  autoconf comes with a program called
`autoscan'.  Here's an excerpt from the Info page:

       The `autoscan' program can help you create a `configure.in' file for
    a software package.  `autoscan' examines source files in the
    directory tree rooted at a directory given as a command line
    argument, or the current directory if none is given.  It searches
    the source files for common portability problems and creates a
    file `configure.scan' which is a preliminary `configure.in' for
    that package.

Is it possible to navigate around the menus using keyboard shortcuts?

I'm moving from ctwm and this is the only thing I can't replicate.  With ctwm
once a menu is popped from the keyboard you can move to the menu items and
select them just by typing the first letter of the item name.  I have gotten
into this and it is very fast for going down three or four levels of menu
nesting.

Cheers,

So, now I am tired, and probably just doesn't see what's really wrong, 
but anyways;

I just compiled and installed pl42 (prev. ver was 40). At startup I get a 
complaint:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwmModules/ PixmapPath

Now, I have the correct paths, in ModulePath, IconPath and PixmapPath. I 
also have the correct paths compiled into fvwm.

I have found no way pass this problem, but as .42 has been around for a 
while, I understand this is not an ordinary bug. However, I found one 
letter on the subject at the mailinglist archive, but no responses.

I would, of course, appriciate any help on this, as it's just so boring 
not having those colorful icons to watch :)

Sincerly,
the _very_ tired

Yes.  An ampersand in the menu item name indicates the hot letter:

AddToMenu Window-Ops "--Window Operations--" Title
+  "&Destroy" Destroy
+  "D&elete" Delete

I think you need  fvwm2, I'm not  sure, but I  don't think this was in

I believe the ampersand works in 1.xx as well.

It is a problem with the Imakefile.

The solution is not define your compiler or compiler flags with
FvwmCompiler and FvwmCompilerFlags in the file Fvwm.tmpl. Let the
default be used (The default is the same setup used to compile your
version of X).

Have fun.

Well. . . I have never really played with a CDE based system, but CDE is
mostly based on HP-VUE from what I can tell.

Since two of our HP-UX boxes are loaded with VUE, I had to learn how to
turn it off.  :)  Actually, our system administrator doesn't use VUE
either.

ANYWAY. . . . unless a lot of the internal workings have changed, you
should be able to run fvwm on your system.  Unfortunately, our two
systems run two different versions of VUE, and the process is different
for both.  On our HP-UX 9.05 boxes, the presence of a .xsession file
tells VUE not to start, whereas on our 10.0 box, you have to set
SESSIONTYPE=xdm in your .vueprofile

Since I really have not used a CDE system, I really don't know, but if
anyone else has experience, I would love to hear about it.

In one of the menu options, there is a way to turn CDE off... I don't
exactly know where it is, but I know it exists... It'd be kinda nasty if
it was permanent huh?

I really wish I would remember to put the patch for this on the web
page....

I messed up in Fvwm.tmpl when I added the FvwmCompilerFlags define.

Apply the attached patch, and that should fix it (plus one other
little problem).

Well, with the upgrade of our OS to Solaris-2.5 comes this beast known
as CDE 1.0.0. I've heard of CDE in the past, but this is the first
I've seen of it in action.

My impression after a two minute demo: it's a resource pig, seemingly
spawning off a bazillion `dtwm' processes (unless our sysadmin
mis-configured it). The available memory on our 128Mb sparc20 hovers
around 500K now; before CDE was installed it typically was 20Mb.

One thing it does offer is virtual workspaces, even for mwm-1.x (we
won't have motif-2.0 for quite some time I'm told). And this thing
that looks like a dashboard to switch between virtual workspaces;
reminded me some of cvtwm. And supposedly a way to restore your
desktop since the last time you logged out -- but it didn't work
:0. (Isn't there an fvwm module that does something similar, or tries
to -- FvwmSaveDeskTop?)

Anyway, does anyone have any advice concerning CDE they'd like to
share? Our sysadmin is keen on replacing XDM with CDE. Are there any
pitfalls involved in that? Can I use fvwm under CDE? What about X
resources? I'm concerned that CDE may somehow over-ride them with some
others stuck in some ~/.dt/* file.

Thanks for any help.

I think autoconf is a nice thing to work towards. I have used it is house
and it is invaluable once the effort has been put in to convert a large
application to use configure. Its' primary author, David J. MacKenzie,
worked for me while a student at the University of Maryland, so I would
gladly see his work in wider use. However every time you muck with the build
procedure you will interject bugs or problems that will take several release
cycles to clean up. Look at what has happened to FVWM the last many months.

Besides trying to clean up things for the release, the Imake configureation
has gone through a couple good sized changes. Each time things that were
fixed before were broke. This will happen with autoconf also. This has also
slowed down the releses of FVWM ( In my opinion ), as constant build bugs
that are reported with each beta tend to keep people from pulling the newest
release once they  have something installed and mostly working. This needs
to get fixed.

Maybe if Chuck had a few "elves" that he could have grab and try his
releases on several platforms before he publicly announced a release we
could clean up clean up the obvious bugaboos before it was announced.
A number of other lists that I am on do this with good success and there
products look much cleaner as a result of this. Typical there is something
like an "fvwm-workers" list, where those commited to supporting the product
can quickly prepare things for release. I do like the open forum of the
fvwm list though, but think something is in order.

I will personally volunteer to test early releases. I have HPUX, Solaris,
SunOS, IRIX, NetBSD, DU (OSF/1), and Ultrix systems I can test both vendor
and X11R6 builds against. If we had a couple/few volunteers for the major
OS's and X11's, then one of us for each or most OS's and X11's could get
back to chuck in a sort about of time so as not to slow up his releases by
more then 1 or 2 days at the most. The result will be better quality control
for FVWM. 

There are many nuances with buiding things under X11. There are a number of
changes from R4, to R5, to R6 and between vendors that make it hard to get
things right if you do not  test them on a number of platforms. Autoconf
will have to deal with some of these same problems. When I started
contributing my changes to the fvwm configuration, I at first only tested my
changes on a couple OS's and under X11R6 only. A number of bugs were
reported then by people who had differnet configurations then I tested
under. Later I started testing under more platforms and using various xmkmf
and X11 versions, and the bugs dropped way down. One more iteration would
probably have stabilized this. The decisions was made to make the build more
Imake-ish at this time, and the changes broke a number of things. Now a
couple iterations later and we still have one or two cycles go before the
build process will be release ready. Lets not do this again right now, as
there are alot more important FVWM things to work on. The current setup will
work fine for most of us with a couple more turns of the crank.

Again, I would like to see further beta releases address changes to the FVWM
code itself, and see the configuration/build process stabilized until after
FVWM-2.1 is released.


(my 2 cents worth)
Randall

I am new to this list, so forgive me if this question has been asked and/or
beaten to death. I have newly started using fvwm. One of the things I was
doing when I was in Motif, was to use the Xterm Control Sequences to change
the icon name and window title. I would like to continue doing that in fvwm,
but have found that the same sequences do not affect the title. Is there
any simple way I can change the title via a script or alias? I need to
change it frequently. Are there different sequences used for fvwm that I
can get a hold of?

TIA,

  CDE is a rework of HP's VUE, done by/for the COSE group (probably HP,
  SUN, IBM, SCO, and maybe others.)  The inter process (module, tool or
  whatever) communication mechanism was changed from HP's BMS (broadcast
  message server) to Sun's ToolTalk.

  According to its author, CTWM, although not based on VUE uses the same
  "rooms/workspace" concept. However CTWM is a derivative of TWM, as is
  FWWM.


  VUE sources ~/.vueprofile, instead of ~/.profile, at the end of its
  initialization.  To use VUE's login screen and authentication but run
  some other window manager, the easiest way is to exec some other script
  at the end of ~/.vueprofile.  If CDE uses a similar mechanism this will
  be the way to go. I would bet this will be called ~/.dtprofile. 

  This is (more or less) what I do to run FVWM from ~/.vueprofile:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VUE=true
export VUE

. ${HOME}/.commonProfile       # shell (almost) independent initialization

exec ${HOME}/.x11start         # start X the old fashioned way
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Somewhere within ~/.x11start (or its derivatives) I invoke fvwm.

Dan has already mentioned keyboard shortcuts.  When you bind a menu to
a key you can move around using arrow keys (or vi cursor movement
keys, or n/p/f/b corresponding to Emacs Ctrl-n/Ctrl-p/Ctrl-f/Ctrl-b).

FWIW, I'm volunteering, too.  Linux/X11R6 and SunOS 4.1.4/X11R6 (but
the latter will probably change to Solaris/OW in a few months).

This is probably a good idea.  That is more or less what the mailing
list started as, but now there are probably more 'user' types than
'tester' types on the list, and it could probably be split up.

Jason - how do you feel about adding a third mailing list (not
publically announced or not easily subscribed to perhaps) called
'fvwm-workers' or 'fvwm-beta-testers' or something like that?  Does
this sound like a good idea to you?  I don't really want to impose
upon your hospitality though, so if you don't want the additional
burden, just say so and we'll figure out something else.  I could just
make a mail alias w/ those people who would like to be these testers
and just do it by hand.

RSW> I will personally volunteer to test early releases. I have HPUX,
RSW> Solaris, SunOS, IRIX, NetBSD, DU (OSF/1), and Ultrix systems I

Wow.  That's quite a number of OS'es.  I cover AIX (IBM's X11R5) &
Linux myself.

If I win the lotto this weekend, I'll buy some workstations for home
and test a few more of them myself.  :) Until then, I may just take
you up on your offer.

RSW> If we had a couple/few volunteers for the major OS's and X11's,

Which isn't bad considering it usually takes a month or 2 for me to
get them out anyways. :)

Most likely.

RSW> and the changes broke a number of things. Now a couple iterations
RSW> later and we still have one or two cycles go before the build

I'm hoping that this next one will take care of it (basically, that
last patch I just sent out should do it, I think).  BTW - I plan to do
a fair amount of work on the next beta this weekend (since I have
Monday off too) so perhaps I can get it out soon.

RSW> Lets not do this again right now, as there are alot more
RSW> important FVWM things to work on. The current setup will work

Definitely.

RSW> Again, I would like to see further beta releases address changes
RSW> to the FVWM code itself, and see the configuration/build process
RSW> stabilized until after FVWM-2.1 is released.

I fully agree with this and have NO intention on changing the build
process again until after 2.1.0 is released.  As you noted, twice was
already too much.

But after that, I'd definitely like to start experimenting with
Autoconf, although other changes (particularly fixes) will obviously
take precidence.  I won't remove Imake at first (perhaps never
depending on how things go) but rather introduce it slowly and try to
make it work both ways if possible.

But I don't see any reason why Autoconf can't be made to work just
fine to configure fvwm.  It may be tricky, but I think in the end
it'll work out much better than Imake has.

RSW> (my 2 cents worth)

Mine too.

Whoops - I'm running late - gotta go!

Yes, I think it's to the point where something like that needs to be done.
List traffic has gone way up in the past three or so months and I think
something needs to be done to get the S/N and Development/FAQ ratios back
up.

I don't have a problem adding another list; actually I expect that it will
reduce the overall volume of mail that I push.  I'm currently experimenting
(somewhat unsuccessfully, but...) with a newer version of the list
software; once that settles down I'll go ahead and work at another list.
I like fvwm-workers myself.

It's not a real problem.  A few lines in /etc/aliases and a couple of
mkdir's and cp's.  And a glorious long weekend to do it in, too!

Hi,

as far as I know, the xterm control sequences do not change just
because you change your window manager.

Here is something from my "~/.bashrc". It puts a useful title in the
xterm window bar. 

############################################################
if [ -z "$HOST" ]; then
    export HOST=`hostname`
fi

# The string between quotes is used to put the CWD
# in the Xterm title bar. -- ECL
if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]; then
    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -en "\033]2;Xterm - ${LOGNAME}@${HOST}:${PWD}\007"'
fi
############################################################


Have fun.

Emilio.

Speaking of menu text, I was dying to know how to right justify
partial text in menus (e.g. for things like Alt-Q) for a long time.
When finally I dug a bit a few days ago I found that you have to
insert an actual tab character in the text.  Coolness :) !

Is this documented (other than source code :) or did I overlook it?

This could be of interest... it is somewhat small, so I figured I'd
post it separately...

It lets you do something like:
Titlestyle Height 24

This patch lets you specify an alternate height other than the default
calculated from WindowFont (this is part of my title-bar patch, but is
better in a small version):

Subject: FVWM: FvwmSaveDesk Operation?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7

I like the FvwmSaveDesk module, but I was a bit confused why in the
man page seems to be more "updated" or something than the program.  It
states that it creates a function called StartupFunction, when it
seems to create InitFunction (this seems more limited ? than
StartupFunction).

Also it would be nice I think to be able to specify a different file
than ~/.fvwmdesk.  Also a different function name.  Then one could
implement multiple dynamic save/restore desktop menus or something.

Here is a small patch, or start at least which changes the default
behavior to work like the man page says, and also adds two command
line options,

-file <outfile> 

and 

-func <funcname> 

which alter the corresponding outputs accordingly (some unused vars
also removed).  Sorry if this is already being worked on...

Thanks to Olivier.Florent@masi.ibp.fr, now I can choose between
CDE/FVWM/OPENWIN at the CDE login/session screen. All I had to was to
make /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession executable.

To follow up on myself:

I'm having problems with fvwm2 (42) racing when tkgoodstuff (my fvwm
module) stops and starts a few times).

Below I attach the strace output.  The wait and select calls are
apparantly from My_XNextEvent, and the write apparently is in
FlushQueue.  This code isn't transparent to me, so I'm hoping someone
will read this who knows what might be going on.  Could it be that
fvwm thinks it still has to write to a pipe to a child (module) that
in fact does not exist?  In the module docs it says fvwm assumes a
module has died only when it gets a read error on the read pipe.  In
my traces, it looks like fvwm is trying to write and not read; is
there a bug in how fvwm knows whether modules have died?

Thanks for any advice,
Mark

Here is an idea for everybody to think about.

It was mentioned in docs somewhere that tkgoodstuff limits the number of colors it
displays.  It is just a factor of preparing the icons and default colors.

However, how hard would it be to (optionally, of course) have fvwm barbarically
force all of the colors it allocates to fit within a number X where X is determined
at runtime?  This would include pixmaps, colors in .fvwmrc, etc...I wouldn't
care if fvwm complained immensely in the event that the colors specified in the
.fvwmrc themselves went over the limit....anyway...

Would it be practical?  The alternative, of course, is to pre-process every
image we are going to use.  For those who would like to use /usr/include/X11/pixmaps
but not like to copy them to a ~/pixmaps subdir and the pre-process them, this
alternative isn't very feasible.  And there are people like me who have always
wanted to go through and limit the colormaps, but don't want to because everytime
I get another pixmap I would have to do it all over again.

Just some thoughts.  Comments sought.

That's what a good sysadmin would do.  Unfortunately not all of us have
such a useful administrator.

Hi,

I'm trying to switch from ctwm to fvwm.  I've got fvwm 2.0.42 running on
my Solaris 2.5 box, but have a few questions...


1)  Is there a way to direct applications to different pages of the
    current desktop?  i.e. Everytime I start up frame, it should go on 
    the bottom left page of the current desktop.

2)  Is there a way to direct a certain instance of an application to a
    given page.  i.e.   xterm -xrm '*Page: 2,2'.  I realize I could do
    this via a menu, or a keystroke, but I'm looking for a way to do this
    from the application command line.

3)  Is there a way to "cycle through" a set of desktops.  I've currently
    got a "next_desk" function that does "Desk 1", and a prev_desk which does
    a "Desk -1".  However, I'd like to have some logic that says
    "if CurrentDesk = 9, go to desktop 0.", and 
    "if CurrentDesk = 0, go to desktop 9."
    Is this possible?

3)  Is there a way to have Next and Prev wrap, rather then stopping at
    the ends of the list?

Thanks for any help.

Jim

I currently use xv to occaisionally put a certain .gif or .jpg as a 
background in my xwindows. Unfortunately, when I do this, the moment I 
cange desktops, FvwmBackground covers it, and the only way I see to get 
it back is restart xv. I know in a previous fvwm2 configuration, which I 
have since accidentally deleted, this did not happen... What causes it 
and how can I fix it?

Please note that the '^g' is literally '^' and 'g'. tcsh will
replace it with CTRL-G; '\e' is escape, and again tcsh will do the

hi everyone

is there any sort of Emacs mode for FVWM files?  i thought i saw one
somewhere, sometime, long ago.  but I haven't been able to find anything
now that i'm actually using fvwm!   

i'm basically looking for any kind of font-lock support, as my RC is
pretty long, and it gets rather tiring looking at the same white-on-black
scheme.

thanks,
greg

hey, all

quick question, should be easy, though i haven't found the answer
anywhere.  the resize text i'm referring to is the little window that pops
up when you do a resize on a window.  with my setup, this window appears
in the middle of my screen, yet i want it in the upper left.  i've tried
using the RC files from Tim Gilman's archive, and some of the files do set
the window in the upper left.  but i can't find whether it's something i
need to add or remove from my RC to get this behavior.

thanks for the help.

hope everyone has a great holiday.  looks like all outdoor plans here in
Chicago will get rained out.  sigh. 

greg

Hi,

Is anyone woking on putting the TTILE ICONS in Fvwm like they are in
Fvwm95.  This is the only difference that makes modules from Fvwm95
incompatiple?  If no one will, I may be willing.

I do have a modified FvwmWinList that can only Show Current Desk 
processes, and that uses TITLE ICONS if available.

How do I submit this, or who do I talk to?

Why don't you try not specifying FvwmBackGround in your .fvwm2rc ... In
ctwm, I used to have the same problem, and the way I fixed it was to take
the default background color off... sorry if this sounds stupid (just
haven't contrib'd to the list and am trying desperately)...

One of the MWM options makes it appear in the middle of the screen.  I
forget which one it is, though.

Basically, I do want the FvwmBacker madule active, as I normally don't 
have backgrounds, but when I do want a background, I like ti to stay. One 
thing I have found to work:

Using FvwmTalk, redefine the appropriate page(s) to call 'xpmroot 
<image>' rather than '-solid <color>'.

This is still a bit cludgy, but works.

Well, I have a patch that doesn't really fix things, but lets me work
around the bug that (so far) only bothers tkgoodstuff.

I've tracked down the bug: the race condition happens when a few
instances of tkgoodstuff have left child processes when they exited.
Fvwm doesn't notice that the tkgoodstuff instances are gone until
until the child processes (of the dead and gone tkgoodstuff processes)
exit.  The race condition goes away when the child processes exit (at
that point, the call to KillModule gets made).

This doesn't happen with FvwmButtons because FvwmButtons doesn't fork
children (but tells fvwm to).

I don't know if there is any better way of sensing module death than
the one fvwm currently uses.  If there is one, it would be best to use
it, of course.  But in any case, one workaround that would make me
happy would be for fvwm to allow a module to tell fvwm to kill it.
Here's a patch that allows this (the module sends "KillMe"):

*** ../fvwm-2.0.42/fvwm/module.c	Tue Apr  2 11:53:31 1996
--- fvwm/module.c	Mon May 27 11:53:28 1996
***************
*** 304,309 ****
--- 304,315 ----
        extern int Context;
        FvwmWindow *tmp_win;
  
+       if(mystrncasecmp(text,"KillMe",6)==0) 
+ 	{
+           KillModule(channel,12);
+           return;
+ 	}
+ 
        /* If a module does XUngrabPointer(), it can now get proper Popups */
        if(mystrncasecmp(text,"popup",5)==0)
  	  Event.xany.type = ButtonPress;

I hope you (Chuck) will consider this.

Thanks, and bandwidth apologies,
Mark

In version 1 the responsible for this thing is the command
"MWMMenus". The equivalent in version 2 is "MenuStyle mwm", I guess.

actually, the option is Menustyle <FG> <BG> <SG> <FONT> fvwm.  this is
documented in the man page, but the effect of the resize/move text isn't
mentioned.

It also contains full set of man pages, example config files, and lots of

I have a hard time believing this.  If you've got FvwmBacker set up to
put up a root window whenever you switch desks, it's going to do it.
There's no way for it to know you've modified the root window after
doing so (yes, I've tried it and looked at the code before coming to
that conclusion).  Perhaps you didn't have your backing command exit
so FvwmBacker hung?

Write a function to toggle FvwmBacker on/off.  You could write it so
that you run the function out of a menu that will call xv with
whatever arguments you want to set the root and then do a killModule
on FvwmBacker.  You can then turn it back on anytime you want through
another menu item.

Hello,

I have an FvwmButtons question. I see, from the man page, no reason why
the enclosed config line should not work. For some reason, it does not.
Either Swallow or Action, that is what experiments show...

Has anyone successfully used Swallow and Action together?

*StatusButtons(Swallow  "xbiff" 'Exec xbiff -bg SlateGray -fg OldLace\
                                -geometry 50x50 -file /var/mail/marc\
                                -update 15 -bw 0 -xrm "*flip: false"',\
                                Size 50 50)

Thanks in advance,

---MAV

I am the manager of a few workstations and I would like to provide a basic
fvwm configuration file for all the users in my network. My interest is in
maintaining a menu structure which is updated everytime a new application is
installed so it can be accessed from the workspace menu by everyone. Besides,
each user should be able to configure his fvwm with his $HOME/.fvwm2rc.

Is it possible to do this with fvwm2? How? I have tried many things, but I
have not been successful. Here is what is happennig:

 - If there is a $HOME/.fvwm2rc, no other configuration file seems to be read
   during configuration.

 - If there is no $HOME/.fvwm2rc, I can't find where the default configuration
   should reside to be read by fvwm2. It is not even clear how the file should
   be called: .fvwm2rc or system.fvwmrc. I have tried both names in several
   places but none of them worked:

	/usr/lib/X11/fvwm/
	/usr1/lib/X11/fvwm/	(I have X11 in /usr1)
	/usr1/lib/X11/twm/
	/usr8/lib/fvwm/		(fvwm is installed in /usr8)

 - I also tried to call fvwm2 with the option -f "Read <file>" but that didn't
   work either. (What am I doing wrong?)

I have version 2.0.42. Is there anything else I can do? Thanks in advance!

I have attached our messages below for reference. I tried the prompt you
suggested, to no avail! The escape sequence for changing title bar and icon 
name is the same that I had been using prior to FVWM. You use prompt changes, 
I used an echo in an aliased cd. In FVWM, I cannot get the escape sequence to 
change the title bar and icon name. I go back to my original question, why
isn't the Xterm Control Sequences supported in FVWM????

I use winmgr.el.  Can't tell you where I got it, and I don't know who

use:

;; winmgr-mode mode will automatically get turned on if you visit a
;; a file whose name looks like that of a configuration file
;; (IE, .fvwmrc, .mwmrc, .tvtwmrc, etc)

;; The current font-lock keywords are:

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by whitespace gets colored using
;; font-lock-function-name-face.

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by a "(" (IE, an m4 macro) gets colored using
;; font-lock-comment-face

;; Put this in your .emacs :
;;
;;(setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)

Hi,

I just downloaded the latest, and greatest version of tkgoodstuff.  
It fixes all the bugs that I had before.  The only complaint is that 
it deleted my old configuration file and replaced it with a copy of 
the default file.  When you change configuration file formats, you 
could at least create a utility to convert from an old configuration 
file to the new format.  It is a pain to go in and reconfigure 
everything each time the file format is changed

Hello all,

I fail to configure the CDE start screen from which you can select
the window manager you want to use (dtwm or olwm as default with the
system installation) to start fvwm.

I have copied the right files from /usr/dt/config to /etc/dt/config
but it seems that it doen't read what's in this directory.

I only have succeeded in adding a new choice in the CDE start screen
for fvwm.

Thank's for your help.

I've been working on a setup for this also.

Fvwm should still read the system.fvwmrc, at least it does for me.

On my system it is /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwmrc, but the directory can be
set to anything when fvwm is configured.  In fvwm 2.0.42, at least, the
location is configured in Fvwm.tmpl.

I put my first attempt at the scripts in 
http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2config-0.1.tar.gz and
http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2debian-0.1.tar.gz.  The first is a
user-extensible system.fvwmrc replacement, that doesn't require every
user to have a .fvwm2rc, and the second is a set of tools for Debian Linux
that maintain a menu structure.

You can find out the right directory by looking at Fvwm.tmpl.  There

I think the system default one should also be called .fvwm2rc.

FVWM *DOES* support program 'Name' & 'Icon Name' changes to change the
titlebar and icon names respectively (see HandlePropertyNotify in
events.c), which is all XTerm does when it sees those esc sequences
(it changes the XA_WM_NAME and XA_WM_ICON_NAME property values for the
window that it creates), which FVWM should then get notified of the
change and update the titlebar.  XEmacs also updates it's 'Name' &
'Icon Name' information to up

I (and many others as you've noticed) have had no problems with this,
so I suspect something else going on in your system that's
interferring here.  Not sure what to tell you to help figure it out
though - sorry.

It doesn't currently look for any system.fvwm2rc file.  However, it
should be looking in 'FvwmDir' for .fvwm2rc if it can't find it in
$HOME.

For the next beta release I plan to make it look explicitly for
system.fvwm2rc in the 'FvwmDir' directory before it tries to read
on by default (haven't decided yet).

Hm.  Now that should have worked...

Well, another way is you could have all of your users read a file at
the top of thier .fvwm2rc files that has all of your explicit menu
definitions and such:

  # top of ~/.fvwm2rc
  Read /path/to/your/system.fvwm2rc
  # rest of user's rc file follows, which may override these things...

Invoke fvwm2 thru a shell.  In "/usr/public/bin/fvwm2" (or wherever):

#!/bin/ksh

# Shell to start fvwm2:

x=`uname -a`
case $x in
  SunOS*5\.*)
  	    ARCH_OS=sun_os5;;
  SunOS*4\.*)
  	    ARCH_OS=sun_os4;;
esac

export SYSBITMAPS=
case $ARCH_OS in
  sun_os4)
	   export SYSICONS=/usr/local/icons
	   export FVWMPLAY=play
	   FVWM=/usr/public/src/fvwm-2.0.40
	   ;;
  sun_os5)
	   export SYSICONS=/opt/icons
	   export FVWMPLAY=audioplay
           export SYSBITMAPS=$i/include/X11/bitmaps
	   FVWM=/opt/public/src/fvwm-2.0.42
	   ;;
  *)
     print "fvwm only supported on Sun OS 4 and 5 (by this shell)" >/dev/console
     exit 1;;
esac

export FVWMHOME=$FVWM/$ARCH_OS

if [ ! -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc ] ; then
  if [ -f $HOME/.fvwmrc ] ; then
    print "You currently have a version 1 .fvwmrc." >/dev/console
    print "Converting it using:" >/dev/console
    print " $FVWMHOME/fvwmrc_convert" >/dev/console
    $FVWMHOME/fvwmrc_convert
  else
    print "You don't currently have a .fvwm2rc file creating one" >/dev/console
    cp /u/tools/dane/fvwm2.0.40/new_user.fvwm2rc $HOME/.fvwm2rc
  fi
fi
export FVWMICONS=$FVWM/icons
export FVWMAUDIO=$FVWM/fvwm_audio

exec $FVWMHOME/fvwm2


The advantages to using  a shell,  is that you  can install  new fvwm2
releases more easily.

As far as sharing menu structures, you would want to put "reads" in the
"new_user.fvwm2rc" file like this:

  read $FVWMHOME/misc.appl.menus

(Use $FVWMHOME, or any other variable you set in your startup shell.)

Maybe FvwmBacker was attempting to change the background and just
silently failing before.

I know that xsetroot fails to set the background when I'm running xlock
or something like that.  (That may sound weird.  I saw it happen
because I have a script that runs as a cron job to set the background.)
I don't really understand that one because I didn't think that xlock
drew on the root window....

Earlier I said that fvwm would still read system.fvwmrc.  My statement was
wrong, but it's because I had misread Carlos as saying "If there is no ...".
I should get more sleep.

I think it may be a mistake to force a global config file to be read.
Or at least it will mean that the system admin can't put too much of an
environment there.  For instance, he can't start modules there, because
not everyone will want them.  A user should be able to completely avoid
a system.fvwmrc, IMHO.

I think this solution is not so hot.  If the location or name of the
global file changes (and it _will_ change), every user .fvwm2rc will have
to be modified.

My system.fvwmrc hack is better, IMHO, because it reads in files from the
user's directory.  (See http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2config-0.1.tar.gz and
http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2debian-0.1.tar.gz.)

Several days ago, I reported a potential bug in fvwm2.0.42 that is
occuring on my HP-UX9.05 box.  It is not something specific to my
account either because others are definately expereincing this.

It essentially occurs when the icon of an Iconified windows is moved.
For some reason, my copy of fvwm2 looses track of it.  Unfortunately,
the pager says the windows is still in place and if I try to move it on
the pager, it will die.

Has anyone expereinced this problem before or am I seeing something
uniq?

-Alan

Ah!  That would be the problem then.  pl34 was rather buggy, and this
was one of the bugs fixed in pl35 (although it was pretty buggy too):

I had forgotten about that.  At the time a LOT of people complained

I recommend you upgrade to the latest level (2.0.42), or wait until I
get the next one out (probably next week some time).

BTW - the next one should be the last beta before the first official
release (finially).

Oh, definitely.  I tried to word it to indicate that, but didn't
succeed.  It'll either be added as an option to turn it on or off
(depending on what I make the default).  Not sure which one I should
make the default though.  I'm leaning towards default off.

True.  This was merely an interim solution suggestion.

A system.fvwm2rc that reads files from the user's directory would be
better, yes, but since fvwm doesn't currently look for a
system.fvwm2rc file, that's a minor problem...  The -f flag is a
workaround to that though (or should be, but Carlos said that didn't
work for him for some reason).  That was the reason I gave the not too
pretty solution as another option.

I solved it for the Debian package by using a symlink from
FVWMDIR/.fvwm2rc to /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm.

This second file contains the real data.

Messy, sure, but I didn't want to modify the startup code.

After a nice holiday weekend I'm back to announce that I've created the
fvwm-workers mailing list as promised.  To subscribe, send the line

subscribe fvwm-workers

to majordomo@hpc.uh.edu and follow the directions that will be returned to
you.  You will be required to confirm the subscription at the address you
are trying to subscribe.  (This prevents someone from forging a message and
subscribing president@whitehouse.gov.)

The list is set up pretty much like this one; I don't have web archives up
yet but I will after there is enough in the archives.  The fvwm list and
the fvwm-workers lists are not nested; I can see many instances where
someone would want traffic from fvwm-workers but not fvwm.

That's basically it.  All interested parties should subscribe to the new
list but wait a few days before starting up discussion so nobody is left
out.  I hope to move all development talk away from the fvwm list in the
next week or so.

I have no problem, then.  (I vote for not always reading the global config 
file by default.  It is less of a change from the current situation.)

The Debian Linux setup has a symlink from /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2rc to
/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwmrc.  I've probably been confusing everyone else. :)

BTW, reading both the global and local config files is not quite enough for
full extensibility, since the user will need a way to add entries to the
middle of the main menu (we don't want to have "Exit" in the middle of the
menu, do we?).

Apologies if this bug is listed somewhere, I looked in all the usual
places and couldn't find it.

Background: 
I run my initial X clients from my .xsession which is set
up thus: a bunch of random junk (X settings, variable settings, etc)
runs, some of it asynchronously, then an xterm runs asynchronously,
then a bunch of other X clients run, most of them asynchronously but
also mostly preceded by sleeps so that they don't slow down that first
xterm, and then finally fvwm2 runs, using FvwmM4 to process the rc
file.

Problem:
If I do something to take the xterm binary out of RAM and then log in,
running the .xsession described above, that first xterm will not get
*any* style attributes, not those specifically for xterms nor those
for "*".  It's the wrong color, isn't SloppyFocused, the borders are
too thick, etc.  Any other xterms, either the second one run from my
.xsession or those run from fvwm or a command line, get all the style
attributes correctly.  And if I restart fvwm, the first one will
suddenly get all the right attributes.  This makes me think it's a
timing problem related to the order the .xsession processes finish in.

If I log out and log back in, it doesn't happen again, presumably
because the xterm binary is still in RAM and runs faster next time
through the .xsession.  But if I kill all my xterms, run a bunch of
Netscapes to eat up my RAM and thus take the xterm binary out of RAM,
and *then* log out and log back in, it happens again.  Same thing if I
reboot, clearing RAM, and then log in.

OS: Digital UNIX 3.0 and 3.2a (tried on two machines)

X: X11R5

Fvwm: Version 2.0.42

Compiler: DEC OSF/1 C compiler 3.11 (comes with DU 3.0 and 3.2a)

Compiler opts: 
Compiled "out of the box" from the instructions in INSTALL.  That
means that the cc options (besides all the include and lib stuff) were
"-O2 -Olimit 2000".  The only change I made was to set the bin and
module directories to be /usr/local/{bin,lib}/X11.


I'm only subscribed to fvwm-announce so if anyone wants more info,
please mail me.

Thanks.

PS - There's another bug, one that's been around since 1.24.  I
mention briefly it here in a postscript 'cause I'm not sure if it
might be one of the mouse-related bugs listed in TO-DO.  I think it
might be in FvwmAuto 'cause it went away when I used 1.24's built in
autoraise - something I obviously can't do with 2.0.x.  But it seems
to be another timing problem so it could just be within the raise or
lower functions themselves.  I'm not exactly sure what causes it but
it usually seems to happen when a window disappears quickly.  Fvwm
gets stuck with the cursor in its intermediate form (the black, filled
circle) until I click somewhere.  Until I do that, X and all my other
apps continue to run but fvwm is stopped.

Has anyone had problems getting FvwmForm to run properly? If I try it
from a FvwmTalk window, I get 

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for
operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  26
  Current serial number in output stream:  36

This happens with both fvwm2 (2.0.39) and fvwm2-95 (2.0.41f).

Any ideas?

There could be two files that fvwm searches for:

- global.fvwmrc, which is always read if it exists
- default.fvwmrc, which is read if the user does not have a .fvwmrc

The sysadmin could choose which files he provides for the users.

Does anyone know how to do reverse video in the title bar?

I use this alias to set the titlebar text.

alias sp   'echo -n "^[]0; ${HOSTNAME}: ${cwd}^G"; echo -n "^[]1; 
${HOSTNAME}^G"'


I would like to make the hostname reverse video.

Thanks.

Or even easier: using a new directive
    ConfigPath: $HOME:/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2
, a "combined" system.fvwm2rc could consist of
    .... a lot of defaults .... and as the last line:
    Read ".fvwm2rc"  # either ~/.fvwm2rc or /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2rc
which would include either the user's config files or the system
equivalents.

Or, using the Pipe mechanism I saw on this list earlier on (and which I
think would be _very_ useful to include as a standard feature), one
could easily write
    Read "| [ -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc ] && cat $HOME/.fvwm2rc || cat /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc"

Or a combination of both methods could be chosen.

Just a thought.

That's my HO too.

Let me say what I do with shell initialization files (~/.bashrc and
~/.bash_profile) in the workstations I take care of. These files, as
they're put in the user home dir by adduser, have something like:

## This is "~/.bashrc". This file is execute by bash for non-login
## interactive shells.

## Everything is handled by a cluster-wide file. Feel free to copy it
## to your home directory and make the changes you want, but be ware
## that eventual changes done to the system will not be reflected to
## your environment! If you want to make small changes, do them
## *after* the indicated line.

SHRC=/usr/local/cetc/sh.shrc
if [ -r $SHRC ]; then
   . $SHRC
fi
unset SHRC

## Put your local customizations after this line.


I think the same scheme can be done with fvwm2: the ~/.fvwm2rc can
"Read" some system-wide file and the user can them do some
"overloading" after the "Read". This works only with version 2, where
the order of the "sections" is no more important.

Hello out there

im fairly happy with my fvwm. Though i'm missing the
one feature to dynamicaly add desks to my running session.
As well a Module desklist (like the winlist) would be fine.

Is it possible to do this dynamicaly?

Fear not.  I liked that idea and plan to include it.

It's just a matter of do I include it before or after the first
official release.  I'm trying to be extremely selective about what
goes in right now so I can actually finially get that beast out the
door, and I haven't decided on a few things yet, this being one of
them.

BTW - I still haven't gotten through all of the mail from the long

Hi there.

I've seen the same thing on Solaris 2.5 (X11R6.1) and Linux 1.3.something 
(X11R6): When I use xsm to start some clients (of which fvwm2 is the 
last) they dont get properties (colors, buttons...) on their windowframes
that i`ve specified in my .fvwm2rc.

BTW: I use FvwmM4 too.

Speaking of FvwmM4: 

Some time ago i posted something about a possible bug in fvwm2 with m4, 
but nobody replied so i try again.

The thing is: FvwmPager behaves different when i use FvwmM4 (or FvwmCpp) 
to process .fvwm2rc than it does when i just load in .fvwm2rc. When 
i use a preprocessor the pager doesn't "flip" to the next page when i 
move the mouse to the edge of the screen as it does when i dont use a 
preprocessor. I have made i minimal config-file that exhibits this 
strange behavior:

--------------------test.fvwm2rc--------------------------
# This enables paging when called with:
# fvwm2 -f "Read /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"
# But *not* when preprocessed:
# fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"
# fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"
 
DeskTopSize 2x2
 
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
----------------------------------------------------------

Would someone please try this out to see if i'm just an idiot or if there 
really is something wrong! (of course i have checked that the 
preprocessors dont change the config-file before passing it to fvwm2)
I have seen this ever since my first fvwm2 (which i think was .39)

Keep up the (otherwise) _great_ work,

Fvwm supports 2^15 (or 2^16?) desks out of the box.  Should be enough
for most purposes.  Only problem is that you might not see them all in
the pager.  But me thinks you could use FvwmTalk to run a new
FvwmPager with one more desk enabled than the current one.

Indeed!  I just invoked FvwmTalk, I hit some keys, and lo! it popped
up, the all-new, all-beautiful HUMONGOUS pager:

Here's what I entered:

    Module FvwmPager 0 11

This generates 12 desks.  

I'm sure someone could create an FvwmForm application where you enter
the number of desks you want and the right command is run...

Whoopie!

Some more info I have figured out.

This is only occuring for windows which DO NOT have a "Style Icon"
associated with them.  (i.e. just the name is displayed).

Also, if you leave the current Desk and return, the icon (name) is
visable again

I don't think that this is possible.  I was looking at the code in fvwm95
to see what would have to be done to add support for ansi escape sequences
in the title bar, but I'm not sure its worth the trouble or the overhead.

Have a good one.

Well, yes, most of the time. :-)

FWIW, I've been happy with five or six desks (I don't use pages).
FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan are the way to manage a lot of windows.

Incidentally, this reminds me.  I've once or twice had fvwm die on me
when I tried to use the builtin window list and it didn't fit onto the
screen.

well, HOSTDISPLAY is apparently set to `hostname`,
which doesn't include the domain in our domain.
(and I can't change that)

Any way to tell fvwm the missing domain once and forever?

I think this is over-complicating things. Why not just find the file the
way vim handles it's .vimrc:

First check for ./.fvwmrc, then ~/.fvwmrc, then system.fvwmrc. The first
one it finds is sourced, and the rest are ignored.

When I enter the following into FvwmTalk it produces an error:
    *FvwmPagerLabel 0 Bla
The error is (line continuation added for easier reading):
    [FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module \
               /usr/local/ls6/lib/X11/fvwm2/sun4-sunos *FvwmPagerLabel

I would consider this to be a bug.  What do you all think?

I thought that initially too, and was thinking that 'Read "< cmd"'
might be better.  But then that would look like file redirection...

A little hard to see there I think, but a possibility.

Or better, perhaps a separate command for it (like "ReadPipe" or
something like that).  I think quite a while ago a patch like this was
submitted (for 1.24r or an earlier 2.xx) to implement this (and a few
other things).  I think I may even have it here.  I had planned to add
that one at one point...

Haven't been keeping track of the announcements, eh? :)  That was

Not currently, no.  But the next beta, theoretically.  FVWM doesn't
keep track of desktop names currently, only numbers.  The pager module
associates names with these numbers, so since the next beta version
should have code to support deleting of module configuration items,
you should be able to delete that pagers saved names, rename them,
then start a new FvwmPager, which would then have the new names.

Also, you can find this in the TO-DO list:

  - Improved FvwmPager (add/rename desktops on fly)

Yup.  This is a long standing bug that I actually meant to fix in the
last release, but it was one of the things that got pushed back.  It
would be required for my above suggestion and I should have it fixed
in the next beta.

Actually, it could be done now if done in a separate file loaded w/ a
Read from the FvwmTalk, or via a variation of that little dynamic-menu
trick I posted a ways back (this is off the top of my head, so there
may be small mistakes here, but you should get the drift):

AddToMenu Utilities "Restart Pager" RunNewPager

AddToFunc RunNewPager "I" KillModule FvwmPager
+                     "I" Read .fvwm2rc-pagerdef
+                     "I" Module FvwmPager 0 5

And .fvwm2rc-pagerdef would just contain the module config for
FvwmPager, so you could edit it then just hit the menu item to get the
new pager.  Combine this with a simple FvwmForm window perhaps to
change the number of desks...hmmm...

And actually, if I make those changes I mentioned above, a nice
FvwmForm window could probably be created to do all that for you so
you wouldn't even have to edit any file manually (it'd all be done in
memory).

Although, maybe you can make an FvwmForm window that could create &
reread the file using existing functions...  I don't have time to play
with this right now (in fact, I've used up too much writing this note
as it is) but if anyone toys around with this idea, be sure to post it
to the list.

Actually, read "| cmd" is similar to perl's open(HANDLE,"| cmd"). Perl
starts the pipeline; reads to HANDLE get cmd's stdout, while writes to
handle are placed on cmd's stdin. Perl *DOES* support 
open(HANDLE,"cmd |"), in which case you can read HANDLE to get cmd's
stdout, but cmd gets an eof on stdin reads.

I can't do it!  I follow the instructions and get this error:

and that same error appears a ton of times before the make finally gives an

I even compiled 2.0 with little trouble, but I need to get 1.24 working.  Has

Here is a patch I made a while ago.
------


I made a patch for 2.0.42 to add commands to add and delete 
module configurations. From FvwmTalk, FvwmConsole or equivallent,

       DestroyModuleConfig <config>

will search lines starting with '*<config>' as a first word, delete 
them.  You can use Fvwm style wildcards. For example,

       DestroyModuleConfig FvwmWinListFont

will delete lines start with 'FvwmWinListFont' as a whole word.

       DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*

will delete all lines starting '*FvwmButtons'.

To add new config lines, just like .fvwm2rc file,

       *FvwmButtonsRows 12

with no leading spaces.

You can easily re-customize modules with these commands without restarting
fvwm (Even easier with FvwmConsole).


Here is the patch.

This set of option is designed for the HP C compiler, where "-Aa"

Be coherent all will be fine.

Thanks for all the help.  The problem was passing the -Aa to gcc.  All's well, 
now I just have to spend the next few months customizing :)

I also ran into a problem with vi.  When I was using mwm, vi seemed to be 
fine.  Now, after switching to fvwm, I can't seem to insert any "#" signs into 
anything.  Is this something common?  Maybe I should check the FAQ, but I'm 
sure someone has the answer :)

Thanks,
Dan

This has nothing to do with fvwm.  The individual applications
(Netscape and XTerm) handle that.

Chuck

ps - It should be just click & drag w/ left mouse button in Netscape
to copy, then middle mouse button over the XTerm to paste.

I had this same problem compiling 2.0.42 on HPUX 10.01.  The problem seemed to be
the '-Aa' option for gcc.  It has been a while since I compiled fvwm, but I think
if you change your compiler in Fvwm.tmpl to cc, it should take care of the 
problem.  If it doesn't, there is probably a way to tell the Imakefile or Fvwm.tmpl
not to use the -Aa option.

I haven't, but my guess is that the '-Aa' flag is bugging gcc.  That
flag is used for the native HP compiler to tell it to be an ansi
compiler.  Gcc already is, and must be interpreting that flag
differently.  It's probably defined in CDEBUGFLAGS - remove it and try
again.

You  should always  check the  FAQ if you  want  others to spend their
valuable time helping you.   At least lie about  it and say "I checked
the FAQ and I couldn't find it".

Fvwm has no  specific interaction with vi.  If  you  can't type a  "#"
sign in any window,  it is possible  that fvwm is intercepting the "#"
before  the application sees  it.   If you also can't  type  "#" in an
xterm, look in your .fvwm2rc for a line like:

  Key # A A Nop

(Any line containing "Key #" would be suspect.)

Since a "#" sign is probably  a shifted 3 on  your keyboard, you might
also look for a line like:

Key 3 S A Nop

I'm using fvwm 2.0.42 under Red Hat 3.0.3 (Linux 1.2.13). When I iconify a
window, and later deiconify it, the window will show up on a different
page of my desktop.

My windows are almost always on the edge of the page, if this helps. I
don't know the protocol of this list. Should I attach my .fvwmrc? I doubt
it would matter in this case. Also, from searching the mailing list
archives, this problem seems to have been around since 2.0.30ish at least.

That's essentially what happens now, except for the naming of files (and
I don't think . is searched).

The problem to be solved is this: many a sysadmin wants to set up a nice,
comfortable default environment for every user.  Something, for example,
that has a menu with all/most X programs that are installed on the system.
So he writes a system.fvwmrc that does this.  So far, so good.

However, many users will want to customize their environment, at least a 
bit.  For example, they might want to change colors, the background, or 
add a couple of entries to the menu.  To do this, they copy system.fvwmrc
to ~/.fvwm2rc, edit it, and they're happy.

Until the sysadmin changes system.fvwmrc to add a new program to the menu.

Instead of copying, the user might just put the line "Read /foo/system.fvwmrc"
as the first line in his .fvwm2rc.  This breaks when (not if) the sysadmin
moves the file to another place.  Also, it will cause helpdesk load when
people accidentally remove the line.

One way to handle this is have fvwm always read both system.fvwmrc and
.fvwm2rc.  This has the drawback that the user might not want any traces of
the default environment, so there must be some override.

My own solution is to have system.fvwmrc read in .fvwm2/post.hook (the name
needs some work, but it doesn't matter).  This solves all problems, I think.
If a user wants a small customization, they can just write a one-line 
.fvwm2/post.hook.  If they want to completely replace the environment,
they can create a .fvwm2rc (in which case system.fvwmrc is not read at all).

Actually, my solution introduces another problem: since I have many `hook'
files, the user may be more confused about what the file should be called.
Documentation can only go so far.

If someone wants to have a look, 
<http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2config-0.1.tar.gz>.

(Note: I use the name system.fvwmrc, although the actual name is
$(FvwmDir)/.fvwm2rc; I think system.fvwmrc is a better name, and I hope
it will be changed back in the future.  But I'm not lobbying it until I
write the code myself.)

This is a known problem for some folks, although I have yet to be able
to reproduce it.  I'll keep trying though.  When I can reproduce it,
I'll try and fix it.

Right.  For certain other problems, yes, for this, no need.

Could be.  I only remember it being mentioned recently though.

In my .fvwmrc, I have lots of menus for tons 'o programs, but they don't seem 
to be in the PATH.  My question is, what PATH does fvwm use?  How can I set 
it?  I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but if I specify a full path to 
a particular program, it works.  If I don't, it fails.  Is there a way to 
catch some error output?  

Thanks,
Dan

P.S.  I read the FAQ :)

Just noticed my menus weren't acting quite right after killing the 
font out of Menustyle (it looked funny)

I use the mwm style of menus and after removing the font specification, 
they reverted to fvwm style.

Maybe it should be changed so that a missing specification (ie: the font) 
doesn't screw up the rest of the line.

This works:

MenuStyle black SlateBlue1 RoyalBlue4 fixed mwm

This doesn't:

MenuStyle black SlateBlue1 RoyalBlue4 mwm


I don't see why both can't work  =)

Well, if your problem is really the shell, you can always do 

Exec "xterm" /usr/local/bin/tcsh xterm &

This will call "sh" to execute "tcsh" to execute xterm. I have not
tested but it may work.

Fvwm tells "sh" to execute your program. Probably "sh" is not properly
configured in your system, maybe because people there use [t]csh?

You can use

ExecUseShell /usr/local/bin/tcsh

to make fvwm2 use tcsh instead of the default sh, if that's your problem.

Emilio.

phantom% hostname
phantom

phantom% hostname -f
phantom.rh.uchicago.edu

phantom% export HOSTDISPLAY=`hostname -f`   # note backticks
phantom% echo $HOSTDISPLAY
phantom.rh.uchicago.edu


does this work for you?  it works under linux, but not with
/usr/ucb/hostname on Solaris.  there may be another cmd that does this
though.  

if not, and it's one machine, just use

phantom% export HOSTDISPLAY='your.domain.here'   # quotes, not backticks

hope this helps,

I have the same problem, but with FvwmCpp. My .xsession basically
consists of some xrdb's followed by:

rxvt &
exec fvwm -f "/usr/lib/X11/fvwm/FvwmCpp -Cppopt -DCHUTNEY -Cppprog
  /lib/cpp .fvwm2rc~

And I know it is a timing problem, because I tried changing the first line
above to:

(sleep 1; rxvt) &

And rxvt gets the correct attributes.

Last time I tried to test my XFree86 X server limits, I entered:
for f in *.xpm ; do sxpm $f & ; done

... And surely enough, the second half of the sxpm clients crashed into the 256 clients on a server limit :-)

Thus: 4 billion desktops for 256 clients max is a bit of overkill :-)

... UNLESS fvwm makes XFree86 think it's 256 clients on a single desktop.

I'd like to do this in my .xsession, prior to exec'ing fvwm2

does fvwm use HOSTDISPLAY, or does it overwrite it, if it exists.


I just play with a personalized hostname now (still untested):

	#!/usr/local/lbin/tcsh
	echo `/bin/hostname`.auto.tuwien.ac.at

X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7



	I have a strange problem using the fvwm_button_pxp8.* patch.
I use a pixmap in the 1st left button:
ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap xfoo.xpm

xfoo.xpm is 22x14 pixels and the button size is 19x18 pixels (without
the 3d borders). So the pixmap is larger than the button.

  My request trashes the left 3d border drawing.
I've included a small xpm to show the result, as my english isn't very
good :)

  As I really wanted this xpm to fit in the buttonbox, I cropped it
to 20x14 (the xpm was still larger than the button), and everything
worked perfectly.

  I don't know if it's a bug, or if I shouldn't display a pixmap
larger than a titlebar button, but if someone can tell it to me :)

I wrote yesterday and got some response, but I've checked it out and I don't 
think that the responses are correct.  My question was about what PATH fvwm 
uses to start programs from the root menus or from GoodStuff.  I was told that 
it uses 'sh' to start programs, like "sh netscape" or something like that.  
The suggestion was that the 'sh' default environment must be messed up.  I 
checked it out, I made a test user with no config files of his own (i.e. using 
the defaults) and was able to start up whatever I felt like.  

Any more suggestions?

I'm interested in using FVWM on my Solaris 2.4 machine (Sparc Classic 
w/32MB ram), and I have a couple of quick questions.

1. Will FVWM work with Solaris 2.4?
2. Any hints on compiling/installing?


thanks,

Maybe it was the known problem of not having a .fvwm2rc file?  Copy
the example file from the distribution to ~/.fvwm2rc and try again.
Also, check the file .xsession-errors for errors that might have
occurred.

Does this help?

1. I have a similar problem to that described in the list-archive

restart fvwm, I am unable to pan my display unless I click on the Pager or
move a window to another screen. I am using FvwmCpp to parse my fvwm
config file. I have only noticed this problem under Linux 1.2.13. I also
use the same config file under HP-UX 9, and have had no problems on that
platform (yet). It doesn't look like the direcitves are commenting out
anything relevant.

2. MWMButtons, which is supposed to make the maximize button look pressed
in when the window is maximized, doesn't seem to work right. Instead of
pushing in
the button used for maximizing, it pushes in the rightmost button (button
2) In my config, these are not the same button.

Here's the relevant info. It is the same as in my previous e-mail..

OS: Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 (Linux 1.2.13)

I have tried fvwm2 42, but it seems to be very unstable. I didn't
find this bug in the mailing list archives or the TO-DO list, so
I thought that I should report it.

The problem is that fvwm2 crashes when I switch to an another
virtual console with ctrl+alt+Fn (Fn is any F-key). This seems to
happen at random times, but very often. To produce it I just
do something in X and switch from and back until it happens.
It always happens when I switch from X to text, never the opposite.

Here is the output:

Fatal server error:
Caught signal 11.  Server aborting

X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
xterm:  fatal IO error 2 (Broken pipe) or KillClient on X server ":0.0"
xinit:  connection to X server lost.

This never happens with fvwm 1.2. I am currently using Linux 1.99.8, but
I had the same problem with 1.2.13.

In case it is a bug in the server, here is the version info:

XFree86 Version 3.1.2 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6000)

It is the SVGA server.
I run it with a Cirrus Logic 5434 card with 2 Mb RAM in 16bpp.

I didn't find any notice of such bug in the XFree86 FAQ.

If you need additional info, just contact me.

Bye.

Thanks again to all that helped.  I'm not sure who mentioned it, but the fact 
that fvwm inherits the environment of the shell that spawned it helped.  For 
me, fvwm is started from my .xsession file.  All I had to do was put a valid 
PATH at the top of my .xsession and all's well now!  Thanks again!

Hi,

I am running X11R6.1 and fvwm2 patchlevel 42 on a Sun Sparc 5 (running 
sunos4.1.3_U1) and have a minor problem with the Pager module.

With *FvwmPagerGeometry -1-1  the pager is a few pixels away from the bottom 
right corner of the screen. Does anyone else see this?

Cheers

Pete

Seems to be a problem of the X server, anyway. I have experienced the same
problem some time ago when I was using a Cirrus Logic card (with either
fvwm-1.24 or olvwm, Linux 1.2.8). As soon as I changed the card, the
problem dissapeared. You may want to try changing/disabling some of the 
server options, see the README.cirrus for more details. 

Regards,
Hector.

Try fixing the environment in which fvwm runs. For example, if it's
started in a .xinitrc or .xsession file, make sure you set an appropriate
path *there*.  What I do is have .xinitrc source /etc/env, and /etc/env 
sources ~/.env if it exists.  /etc/zshenv sources /etc/env and sets zsh
specific environement variables.  etc... it gets complicated with all the
different shells, if you're trying to support multiple, each with its own
invocation methods, but it's doable.

Back to the point, if the path is set in fvwm's environment, the programs
that fvwm starts should be found w/o a problem.

Hope that helps.

It uses the one that it inherits when it starts.  So make sure that
whatever script you use to start fvwm sets the PATH first.  For
example, I have

. ${HOME}/.profile

at the beginning of my .xsession file.  All the programs run out of my
.xsession use the same PATH as my shells (since I use bash).  If you
use *csh, have your startup script run that same shell and source your
startup file at the beginning (might not be necessary - I seem to
remember those shells source the startup file automatically).  If you
really want to get complicated, you can make your .xsession be a
/bin/sh script and get the path from your .cshrc by doing the
following:

#!/bin/sh
/bin/csh -c "printenv" | \
	sed 's/^\([^=]*\)=\(.*\)/\1=\"\2\" export \1/' > /tmp/foo$$
. /tmp/foo$$
rm /tmp/foo$$

Ugly, but at least you don't have to write a *csh script if you've
already got a /bin/sh script.

Yup, I don't think this is a problem in fvwm; it's definately your
server that's bailing out.

Maybe you have bad memory/cache?

How much RAM do you have?

Hello, all.

A few months back, someone posted an ftp site that contained the pixy tool 
for reducing colors in xpm files. Does anyone remember this site address? 
Alternatively, can anyone point me to a reliable tool that reduces xpm 
colors? 

I've taken myself off the list, so please send all reponses to 
deryl@tivoli.com.

thanks.

It should be one pixel off.  Try -0-0

I would suggest you first try version 3.1.2E and see if the problem
can be duplicated.

If the problem still occurs, with 3.1.2E, you should try adding
"NoTrapSignals" to the ServerFlags section of your XF86Config file
and then get a backtrace from the core.  Note that doing this is likely
to leave your video console in an unusable state when the segv occurs.
Just press CTRL-ALT-DELETE to reboot and then examine the core file.

As this is not an Fvwm problem, further discussion should be moved
somewhere more appropriate, such as comp.os.linux.x (and you should
send a copy of the backtrace to XFree86@XFree86.org).

Here it is again:

I  made  an attempt to  provide  a program   that automates  the color
reduction and you will find the program in  fvwm 2.0.42 in the "utils"
directory.    Subsequently   Romano  Giannetti  and   Martin   Kraemer
introduced "pixy2" which outclasses my effort with a much better color
matching algorithm.  Pixy2 can be gotten from:

I think it is not the point, whether the trailing bar notation might
be a "little hard to see there"!  Much more important will be, how easy
somebody trying to write a .fvwm[2]rc file will be able to remeber the
syntax needed to invoke this feature and what its semantic will be.

I don't think that the probability, that somebody reading an existing
.fvwm2rc file will overlook this trailing bar, justifies to choose
one of those less intuitive choices.  Almost always the content
of the string after the Read command will make clear, that it is
a shellcommand and no simple include filename.  Only if the shell
command is simply an executable script with an arbitrary name, this
might cause some confusion.  But then a short look into the script will
make it obviuous.

IMHO a trailing '|' is most logical notation for the "Read from
a pipe"-feature.  Writing .fvwm[2]rc files without continuously
refering to the man page or other existing .fvwm[2]rc files is already
hard enough.

[...\ notation...]

Indeed.  I must have overseen that.  Sorry.

I just noticed that if the only part of two windows overlapping is
the title bar, then calling the "Front" function always places the
window behind the other.  If any of the body of the window is overlapped,
it works fine.  Anyone else have this happen?

Well, I know this isn't exactly the right place to ask, but I'm stumped.

I am looking for mgdiff  (a motif gdiff lookalike)

All the pointers are to ftp.x.org, and a non-existant directory within  =(


Any help at all would be appreciated.

This used to happen to me all of the time.  I vaguely remember that
this was caused by a bug in the server.  I upgraded my server and
haven't had that problem since.  I think it's enough to just upgrade
the server and not all of X.  (Well any libraries the server uses
too.)

It shouldn't do this, I haven't updated that patch to the latest fixes
yet, but I will check it out and fix it if necessary.

Could you tell me what type of commands (if any) you have in your window style
and title style, of the type Flat or MWMButton?

Thanks

I've just confirmed that I DO have the same panning problm on HP-UX 9. I
believe that it is fvwm 2.0.40. There should be a --version option to make
finding this out a little easier.

Thanks for this detailed report.  The problem is the result of a
subtle signed/unsigned addition gone awry.  I will post a new patch in
a few days, but here is a quick patch to pxp8 which I think should
alleviate the problem.

Sincerely,
Andrew

Hi there. I have just built fvwm2 (version 2.0.42) on Solaris 2.4. I
have also built libXpm.a. I had to do a fair amount of makefile
hacking because my system has an out of whack imake but I did
eventually produce the goods. -DXPM and -DSHAPE where both on the
compile command line for fvwm2. The executable I produced seems to
work with one exception, I can't make the xpm icons
appear. Unfortunately my knowledge of X is slim and so I thought I'd
turn to you guys for help...

I have the following in my .Xresources file.


Emacs*iconPixmap*: /home/cbenson/etc/gnu.xpm


When I fire up emacs or xemacs I would hope that the icon would look
like the spiffy coloured bull in the indicated file. I can verify the
path using sxpm. (x)Emacs comes up without any problems but it has no
nice icon. Instead, it like all the icons are just long slim buttons,
big enough to hold the window title. I am using the sample .fvwm2rc. I
have edited it as follows...

##########################################################################
# PATH Setup 
#
# Colon seperated unix directory paths for Modules, xpm files, and bitmaps
ModulePath /usr/local/lib/fvwm2
#PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/include/X11/pixmaps
PixmapPath /home/cbenson/lib/pixmaps:/home/cbenson/etc
IconPath   /usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/home/cbenson/lib/pixmaps:/home/cbenson/etc

This (ie the modified PixmapPath path) is the only change I made to
it.

I realise that this is not the worlds best problem definition but I
would be greatful for any and all help you can provide.

Thanks
