Subject: FVWM: FvwmCpp problems
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I've been trying to use FvwmCpp to make my life and those people who
use my rc's lives easier

#1 problem, manpage is wrong almost any instance of FvwmCpp usage
     Manpage:   use fvwm -f "FvwmCpp .fvwmrc"
     Correct:   use fvwm -c "FvwmCpp .fvwmrc"

#2 What are valid comment symbols in an FvwmCpp file, /* */, #, //,
all of the above?

#3 After adding a couple #defines for colors ie.

#define GRAD1 Blue
#define GRAD2 rgb:C0/C0/C0

The colors work, but later, most of my styles won't. The styles worked
before I started trying to use FvwmCpp

I do most of my styles in this form:

Style "*"               IconBox 72 -40 -1 -1 ,\
                         StickyIcon,\
                         MouseFocus,\
                         SmartPlacement,\
                         RandomPlacement,\
			 (etc.)

After using FvwmCpp on this file, the IconBox is ignored as are all
the Icon commands later in the file.


Any help is appreciated,
Thanks

does anyone have a script, like the one for tkgoodstuff
that will send netscape a string that's highlighted.


basically I thought I would use a function to send a message to an 
existing netscape or start up a new one with the hightlight text in question.

does anyone already do this?

Well, the tool you need is xcb.  You can use it to print the primary
selection to stdout.  I don't have it now, but the following ought to
be close:

    netscape -remote openURL(`xcb -p 0`)

Something like that.

Grab xcb from ftp://www.x.org/contrib/utilities/ and use it in a
script like this:


#!/bin/sh
## Note: not fully tested

url=`xcb -S 0 && xcb -p 0`

if [ "$url" ] ; then
  netscape -remote openURL\("$url"\) >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    || exec netscape "$url" &
else
  exec netscape &
fi

exit 0


Then just call this script from a button.

Yup, I've bound mouse button 3 to a shell script (which uses tcl/tk to
get the selection) that will connect with a netscape session.  Note
that embedded double quotes in the selection will cause some problem.

Here's the ns-sel.sh script:

    #! /bin/sh

    NETSCAPE=netscape301

    sel=`tksel.tk`

    if [ -n "$sel" ]
    then
	ARG="-raise -remote OpenURL($sel,new-window)"
    else
	ARG="$sel"
    fi

    exec $NETSCAPE $ARG

(Replace 'NETSCAPE' assignment with the name of your netscape
executable... we have multiple versions of netscape here, so
'netscape301' runs one of the latest).  The selection is retrieved by a
tcl/tk script called 'tksel.tk' which is reproduced below:

    #! /bin/sh

    # *-tcl-* \
	exec wish4.2 $0 $*

    wm withdraw .
    puts [selection get]
    destroy .

You may want to change the name of your wish interpreter in this
script.  The logic should be pretty easy to figure.

Another application that could be use is 'xcb' (a standard X utility
that manipulates the various cut buffers).  The problem that I've
found is that tcl/tk's selection mechanism seems to be superior to
that used by xcb.

Of course, your milage may vary.  [smile]

A slightly modified version of the script would be as follows, so that
netscape always gets tried with -remote first - otherwise if you tell
fvwm to start a new netscape, but you've got nothing selected, you'll
always get a new netscape, and netscape doesn't like sharing with
itself :-) (In my version of the script, I start netscape on a remote
machine, so I've got to pass the DISPLAY to the script aswell)

#!/bin/sh

DISPLAY=${1:-${DISPLAY}}
export DISPLAY

url=`xcb -S 0 && xcb -p 0`

if [ -n "$url" ] 
then
  netscape -remote openURL\("$url"\) \
    || exec netscape "$url" &
else
  exec netscape -remote \

I tried this patch, and it fixed the error I was getting, but it 
caused a new error:

[ena2] </home/users/paulb/fvwm-2.0.45>make all
"Makefile", line 534: make: 1254-055 Dependency line needs colon or
double colon
 operator.
make: 1254-058 Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue.
[ena2] </home/users/paulb/fvwm-2.0.45>

It seems that MakeSubdirs line in the Imake file is not being 
called as a function, but is being interpreted as a dependency line.
 
Thanks.

A user of mine noticed a bug in FVWM 2.045. He says if he fires up some
clients in his .xsession before starting fvwm (ie: xbiff, couple of xterms 
& etc) that very often, the "Style" parameters are not properly processed
for one of the clients (usually xbiff, but appears to be random or system
timing related). When it happens to xbiff, the window title & handles are 
drawn even though the Style setting turns them off.  If he restarts fvwm, 
all windows are correctly decorated when they are reparented. This is happening
on a fast Sparc (Ultra-2 200Mhz), so that may also be bringing out a latent
timing bug. Any ideas?


thanks!

Simple fix - start the apps from inside fvwm.
A nice way to do this is to simply source an external file (.startup
or similar) in the init-function. Works fine for people who other-
wise do not want to mess with fvwm.

As to why this behaviour occurs - dunno. :-)

Hi, folks.

I'm new to fvwm, and I have a ton of questions.  Is there a FAQ 
I can refer to before I ask them?

Thanks,

Okay, I saw that one.  Thanks, though.

Here's my problem:  My monitor is at the 640x480 resolution, 
and my screen size is something like 1100x900.  I want to 
configure fvwm2 so that my virtual desktop size matches my 
physical screen size.  The FAQ helped clear up the difference 
between screens and desktops, but neither the FAQ nor the man 
pages are helpful here.

What is the setting in the rc file to make the desktop the same 
size as the physical screen?

I'll appreciate any help I can get with this.

Ahhh... Linux huh? :) Well, the problem is that Linux itself (X11) is
telling the window manager that it has a bigger screen than it does. And
when then window manager attempts to go to the extra space, linux just
scrolls everything over, as tho you were looking through peep hole or
something... 

	What you should look at is the configuration of the Xserver, not
the window manager. The default Xserver for Linux is Xfree86, unless you
got the redhat CD, in which case it installs Metro-X (RedHat's commercial
Xserver). Then there's also Accelerated X... In any case, you should look
into the configuration of the Xserver to make sure your physical screen
size matches whatever else is available. 

	I don't know how to configure anyone of those, all I can say is to
look through some HOW-TO's or documentation. If it's XFree86 that you
have, look into your XF86Config file (look for it, prolly somewhere in
/etc) towards the end of the file at the definition for your monitor. I
think the keyword is Virtual... Make sure that Virtual matches your actual
screensize :)

you are using XFree86 on your machine, thats why you can (are) getting a 
"virtual" resolution larger than what your monitor is running at.  This 
isn't controlled by fvwm2, but by the X server config file (usually 
/etc/XF86Config)

btw,  virtual resolution isn't all that bad... i have a 1600x1200 16bpp 
virtual on my 800x600 monitor and it cuts down on clutter.

That's not a fix ... it's a workaround.  This doesn't work if you
maintain the same startup files for several systems, any of which might
not have fvwm available.

I've experienced the similar behavior; i use `xsession' as my only
client in ~/.xsession.  xsession starts up all other clients from
~/.X11Startup; it appears to start the window manager simultaneously.
The first client or first two clients from ~/.X11Startup both
occasionally (often with a heavily loaded system) appear with borders
and title bars when they have `NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0'
styles set.  The borders and titlebars that appear do not have any of
the attributes set by global `Forecolor' and `Backcolor' styles.

Hi Again,

here's a little addition to yesterday's script which helps the script
decide if you really intended to use the current selection or not. I
noticed this because the current selection remains, even after the
window you selected stuff in is long gone.

So if you change the xcb line to be:

    url=`xcb -S 0 && xcb -p 0 | perl -ne 'if(m,(\w+://\S+),){print $1;exit}'`

then the perl script will only give back the URL, which I have defined
to be anything with the string "://" in it - delemited by whitespace.
It also only prints the first url found, in case there are multiples
in there.

Happy zapping :-)

Steve

X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


Problem:  When I'm running fvwm2 as _me_, using the resource files that 
came with the distribution, the menu items that relate to Xterms and 
NXterms appear on the menus, but don't activate anything.  (But when
I'm running as "root", they work.  In both cases, I'm using system
resource files rather than resource files that I've customized (no ".fvwm*"
in the home directories, but rather running from "/etc/X11/TheNex*/.fvwm2rc*".
Looking at paths both as "root" and as "coats", it doesn't look as though that
should be the problem.

I have tried to customize the resource files to some extent, but the 
problem persists when I go back to the originals (which I carefully
saved read-only copies of as ".fvwm2rc.*.orig".)

The problem appeared after a power outage last night (when I was logged
in as root, had tried to add some customization to the system ".fvwm2rc.*", 
and then was in the process of building "g77" that I had just down-loaded; 
I don't know whether that might have anything to do with it or not.

As I understand it, if an app is "not there", it doesn't appear on the 
menus (but does that apply to "new shell" or to "root shell" in the
distributed resource files?).  Any suggestions on where to start?

Thanks!

Hi, I am new fvwm user. this question was sent to this mailing list before, but
no one answer it. I heard several other people also have the same problem, that
is: whenever you start a Motif application, in this example,NEdit, you can see
a lot of messages about _MOTIF_DRAG_WINDOW whatever. I don't know if I miss
some Motif setting in my .fvwm2rc, If someone have experience with it, please
let me, I do appreiciate that.

Hi,

I'm assuming this is a bug of some kind.  On my system, FvwmButtons
swallows the FvwmPager, xdaliclock, coolmail, and xbiff.
Additionally, I have buttons for starting several apps.  For some
reason, clicking on one of the buttons causes all of FvwmButtons to
crash, taking everything else with it.

Here's my FvwmButton setup for starting plan, which caused this crash
(Plan was still started...):

*FvwmButtons Plan       calendar2.xpm   Exec plan &


Here's the crash output:

I just finished building fvwm, and I can run it.  I have built and installed the

xpm package, but when I run fvwm2, I get this error.

ld.so.1: fvwm2: fatal: libXpm.so.4.3: can't open file: errno=2

I'm not sure what's complaining here.  I can't seem to figure out what file can't

See ld(1)!

It's the dynamic loader that's complaining: it can't find (or perhaps read?) 
the shared library libXpm.so.4.3.  Exactly how you fix this is a bit system 
specific, but typically you could do one or more of the following: ensure that 
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the directory where the 
shared library is installed (and that this is done in the process from which 
fvwm2 is run); relink fvwm2 with the -R flag (or with the LD_RUN_PATH 
environment variable set), giving the (absolute) directory containing the 
shared library; link fvwm2 statically against libXpm.  (You probably don't 
want to do the last one.)

i remember having this problem as well.  what i think i ended up having
to do was go into the makefile and put the explicit library i wanted to
use instead of just -lXpm

 XPM_LIBRARIES = /usr/local/lib/libXpm.so.4.3 -lXpm

the problem seemed to be that the libXpm.so wasn't linked to
libXpm.so.4.3 and i think i used this method cause i didn't have
privilage to change the link.

i basically hacked it until it worked.  a more knowlegeable unix
guru might have a better solution.  but i hope that helps.

i've been checking out netscape communicator and it looks like they're
combining the mail and news reader.  what this means for me is that it
will no longer work for me to use the mailer icon as my indicator that i
have new mail.

so what i'm looking for is a version of an xbiff type program that can
do POP, will ideally let me choose the icons, and works well with
FvwmButtons (everybody's always talking about it, i figure i might as
well give it a try).

thanks in advance.

I use tkRat, which requires tcl/tk.  I don't use it with FvwmButtons,
but if you iconize the application, it can alert you when new mail
arrives.  It does POP3 and IMAP4 as well as other stuff.

It's home page is:  http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~maf/ratatosk/

I have the following function bound to the Break key:


AddToFunc my_kill       "I" Close
+                       "I" my_prev

together with the following focus moving functions

AddToFunc my_home	"I" Next [FrontPanel CirculateHit CirculateHitIcon] 
my_deiconify
AddToFunc my_nexticon	"I" Next [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_home
AddToFunc my_nexticon_s	"I" Next [Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHitIcon] my_focus
+			"I" None [Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHitIcon] my_home
AddToFunc my_previcon	"I" Prev [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [Iconic CurrentDesk] my_home
AddToFunc my_previcon_s	"I" Prev [Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHitIcon] my_focus
+			"I" None [Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHitIcon] my_home
AddToFunc my_next	"I" Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_nexticon
AddToFunc my_next_s	"I" Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHit] my_focus
+			"I" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHit] my_nexticon
AddToFunc my_prev	"I" Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_focus
+			"I" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk] my_previcon
AddToFunc my_prev_s	"I" Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHit] my_focus
+			"I" None [!Iconic CurrentDesk CirculateHit] my_previcon
AddToFunc my_focus	"I" Focus
+			"I" my_cursorwarp
AddToFunc my_cursorwarp	"I" WarpToWindow 50p 50p /* Top left button on most */
+			"I" Current [*term] WarpToWindow 97 90 /* scrollbar */
+			"I" Current [xterm] WarpToWindow 3 90 /* sb on left */
+			"I" Current [dockit] WarpToWindow 50 50 /* FrameMaker */
+			"I" Current [xpsview] WarpToWindow 50p 100p
+			"I" Current [FrontPanel] WarpToWindow 50 50

The intent of all this is that when I kill a window the focus moves somewhere 
sensible.  This fails sometimes when the window I am about to kill is the only 
window on the screen that does not have a CirculateSkip style .  What should 
happen is that the focus should find its way back to the FrontPanel window 
(FvwmButtons).  What I think is happening is that the Close in my_kill is being 
done but the window doesn't go away until after the Prev in my_kill is executed. 
 The Prev in my_kill finds that window that is going to die and happily sets the 
focus to it, it then dies and focus is left marooned.

Is there a way to stop execution of a function until after the Close has 
happened?  Failing that is there a clever way of making a window go-away before 
the next line of a function runs? (FvwmBanner; wait FvwmBanner; does not count 
as clever).

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

Hi,

I am using FvwmIconMan in the lower right corner of every
page (geometry is similar to -1-1). The problem I notice is
that by switching pages the icon manager slowly moves lower
until it is not visible anymore. By using move from the menu
and just clicking once into it it jumps back to place it
should be.

Some other actions move it too, I don't now which exactly,
but it keeps moving away even if I don't switch pages of my
desktop.

Has anybody noticed this? What con you do about it?

Bjrn

I don't know if it's possible to do what you want directly in your
fvwm config file, but if you're willing to let an external shell do
the work for you, you can take advantage of the FvwmCommand module
(it's in the extras directory).  For example, I do the following in my
.X11Startup:

doweb(){
    FvwmCommand 'Style "Netscape" StartsOnDesk 5, SkipMapping'
    $HOME/bin/xcmd netscape -geometry 900x725+1+1
    until [ `xwininfo -root -tree | grep -c Netscape` -eq 2 ] ; do
	sleep 1
    done
    FvwmCommand 'Style "Netscape" StartsAnyWhere, ShowMapping'
}

This ensures that when I fire up netscape at login, it's first window
goes on desk number 5.  I look for two windows because (I'm guessing)
netscape seems to have an unmapped second window that actually gets
created first (you can't imagine how long it took me to debug that!).
But anyway, after that, I use browse-url within emacs to pop up web
pages and I don't want to have to jump to desk 5 to see them.  Thus,
after I detect that netscape has started and mapped its window, I
reset the style to StartsAnywhere.  For a long while I'd been doing
this manually with a hardcoded Style and used FvwmTalk and then
FvwmConsole to do the reset to StartsAnywhere.  When I discovered
FvwmCommand, boy was I psyched!  I can see this method being used in
the following manner for your situation:

In a shell script called, say fvwmclose.sh:

#!/bin/sh
until ! xwininfo -id $1 >/dev/null 2>&1 ; do
sleep 1
done
FvwmCommand your_focus_function_here

Where your my_close function calls Close and then Execs the shell
script with $w as argument.

It's almost certainly not very efficient, but it should work well
enough to keep you happy.  Note, though, that I have not tested the
above at all (except for the syntax of the until loop).  Your mileage
may vary and the rest of the usual disclaimers apply.

If you are using the version packaged with fvwm 2.0.45, you need the latest
version. I believe that I finally fixed that bug. The cost though is that the
manager windows no longer unmap themselves when empty. 

You can get the latest from:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/

Caveat: you need the fvwm sources to compile it.

Hi-

Occasionally, when I'm mousing around the desktop, I get the following
message on the console: 

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed:
/harpo/users/jaffe/X11/fvwm2/
Permission denied

It appears that some button action I'm taking isn't defaulting to NOP,
but attempting to find some module. Any ideas what's going on?

Why not just define a function like this ?

AddToFunc  "ChangeStyle"
+  "I"  Style "Netscape" StartsAnyWhere, ShowMapping

Because then I have to remember to run that function every time after
Netscape starts.  I also have to reset it if I quit netscape (which
occasionally I need to do to free up colors; I find -install is broken
for plugins and applets) and want to rerun it.  And there's no way to
define a run-netscape function the way I had wanted:

AddToFunc "DoNetscape" 
+ "I" Style "Netscape" StartsOnDesk 5, SkipMapping
+ "I" Exec netscape
+ "I" Wait "Netscape"
+ "I" Style "Netscape" StartsAnywhere, ShowMapping

It doesn't work basically the the second Style gets executed before
the Netscape window pops up.  I don't know why.  Mabye it's that
same unmapped window problem I had with the shell script.

In addition, Netscape is not the only application I want this behavior
for, and I happen to be lazy.  What FvwmCommand combined with a shell
gives me is the ability to have all this stuff happen automatically
without having to do all that typing to FvwmConsole.  Sure I could
define a bunch of functions for every application and situtation.  I'd
also have to define them twice, once in .fvwm2rc and once to
FvwmConsole since I hate doing restarts unless absolutely necessary.
With FvwmCommand and the shell, I get the behavior I want at the cost
of writing a few lines of /bin/sh and I only have to type them once.
In the worst case, I decide to add an Exec for a given script to a
menu or FvwmButton, but that's pretty rare.  I do most of this stuff
at login.

I was wondering if you would happen to know a way to create the
Pop-up help widgets on an HTML page using Applets or JAVA.  Is this
possible?  

      Example:

                  -->ICON(Name)
                      ---------------
                      | Writes Name |
                      ---------------

    For example, as Netscape would do if you held the mouse arrow on 
a button.

  Thank You,
     Chris Geheran

Version 0.9.9 of FvwmIconMan is out. 

Changes since 0.9.8:
	Fixed bug where manager window wouldn't get
		properly cleared when it became empty.
	Changed function lookup to use bsearch
	Added 'label <string>' function, to provide named
		labels to jump to with bif, bifn and jmp.
	Altered get_current_man to always return the manager
		if there is only one.

Major thanks to Adam Rice (wysiwyg@glympton.airtime.co.uk) for adding the
label function so that we don't have to compute those relative offsets like we
did when we were kids pecking in assembly code into our primitive boxes.

As always, the you can get this from:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/
	or
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/FvwmIconMan/

For those who haven't been keeping up, here are the changes between 0.9 (the
version with fvwm 2.0.45) and 0.9.8:


4/19/97		Version 0.9.8:
			Changed hash table size to 257.
			Fixed bug where followfocus was ignored.
			Hopefully fixed bug where some buttons wouldn't get
				drawn when window shape changed.
			MiniIcons should work on mono displays.
			
3/9/97		Version 0.9.7a:
			maximum width changed from 1000 to screen width.

2/11/97		Version 0.9.7:
			When FvwmIconMan was started without a managergeometry
			string, it would have an "Internal Error."
			Added titlebutton option.
			Added raisededge and sunkedge button styles.
			Manager no longer unmaps when empty, drawing the
				titlebutton instead.
			Added builtin function "warp"

2/10/97		Version 0.9.6:
			Added call to XSync() after setting window shape,
				otherwise, will get blank regions on next
				redraw.

2/7/97		Version 0.9.5:
			Fixed bug which caused buttons to change size
				when switching pages under high load.

2/6/97		Version 0.9.4:
			Added new action functions: bif, bifn, jmp, ret, print
				so now you can have simple if statements
			Fixed bug which caused manager to appear in surprising
				places when moving from one page to another.

2/5/97		Version 0.9.3
			Fixed bug where if a window moves from one manager
				to another (which can happen while FvwmIconMan
				is receiving the window list from fvwm), it 
				can end up using the format string of the 
				wrong manager.
			Fixed bug where if a window's name changes and
				that causes it to be removed from manager,
				it core dumps.
			Fixed bug which could cause FvwmIconMan to deadlock.
			Fixed window gravity bug which would cause corrupted
				window contents for managers which grow upward
				or leftward.
			other minor bugs.

2/4/97		Version 0.9.2:
			Silly me, I forgot that realloc (NULL, ...) isn't
				portable.

2/3/97		Version 0.9.1:
			rewrote almost all of the X code.
			can have multiple columns now.
			use shape extension if configured to.
			added shape option.
			added ButtonGeometry option.
			renamed Geometry option to ManGeometry, which works
				in units of buttons, not pixels.
			junked the old actions and redid all that.

Subject: FVWM: how to change icon (button size)
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Dear fvwm users,
I would like to get the buttons with icons smaller.
It is possible?

1.On one computer I use 'fvwm' because I have only 16Mega Ram, so
the "buttons with icons" are defined using (e.g.)
*GoodStuffGeometry -x-y
*GoodStuff scilab scilab.xpm Exec "scilab" scilab &

2. On the other computers I use fvwm2 and fvwm95-2 so
the buttons with icons are defined the following way:
(fvwm2)
*FvwmButtonsGeometry -x-y 
*FvwmButtons(Title ..., Icon .., Action 'Exec ...')
and fvwm95 similarly:
*FvwmButtons scilab scilab.xpm Exec ....

I have tried to use the commands 
*GoodStuffGeometry -x-y
or
*FvwmButtonsGeometry -x-y but I could not achieve I want I mean
I could not get the buttons with icons smaller.

Could someone help me please,

Jan Krupa

Hi,

Since I installed XFree86 3.3, I cannot start FVWM or any other 
windows managers anymore.  Everytime when I type startx, twm 
will be started no matter what I have in my .xsession file such
as "exec fvwm" or "exec afterstep".

Please tell me how to fix this.  Thanks in advance.

You sure you have the current version?  My fvwm2 man page is pretty
clear on it.

Regardless, here is an example,

TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 128 grey grey40
TitleStyle Inactive HGradient 128 grey50 grey20

If this doesn't work, then you need a new version.

Hi,

I try to connect to: ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm  server from the FVWM
official web page to get the version 2.xxx.  But I couldn't.  I would like
to know if that server is down ?  are there others servers that I can get
the fvwm version 2.xxx ??

Thank you,

I get this error message a lot and I am not too sure what I am doing
wrong. In the particular case of the above message, I get it when I
start emacs. The Xdefaults for my emacs are:

emacs*foreground:               black
emacs*background:               tan
emacs*borderWidth:              5
emacs*cursorColor:              black
emacs*internalBorder:           5
emacs*marginBell:               true
emacs*nMarginBell:              8
emacs*pointerColor:             black
emacs.pane.menubar.background:  #ababab
emacs.font:                     8x13

The color 'tan' is defined in my rgb.txt file and at different times,
it has actually come up with the correct color although I don't know
why. I am not running netscape or anything 'color' intensive. Can
someone tell me where to look to figure out how to get my color maps
to work beter?

Thanks,
Carvel

Your first challenge is to find out what is using up your colors.

I've  found the "colormap" utility by  Barry Solomon to be helpful for
this although nothing that I've found can  absolutely identify what is
using the colors.  (The colormap is shared after all.)

If fvwm2 turns out to be the culprit, there is a "colorlimiting" patch
for fvwm 2.0.45 that I  can send you  that  limits the colors used  in
icons and pixmap textures that should help.

Get fvwm 2.0.45, build it, and go into the "extras" directory and build
FvwmCommand.  This is a server/client module that allows you to send
commands to fvwm from shell scripts (or other programs).  With this,
you could use the following in tcl script:

	exec FvwmCommand {Module FvwmList}

to start up that module.

I use the following to control a few main xterms that I always use.
(I use the animation just for the heck of it).

One problem is that this does not seem to Raise a window if it is
currently open onscreen.  I preseume this is due to the Wait command
actually waiting for a NEW window to pop up with the given name.

AddToFunc RaiseFocus-Named-Xterm
+       "I"     None [$0] 	Exec exec xterm -name $0 &
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Iconify -1
+       "I"     Wait $0
+       "I"     Next [$0]       WarpToWindow 50 50
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Raise
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Focus
+       "I"     Next [$0]       AnimatedMove $1p $2p


Is there any way to rewrite this to make it work like I'm implying I'd
like it to?  Namely, that it will either create or uniconify a window
of the given name, and then raise it to the top, and if it already is
non-iconified, then just raise and focus.

I order to get functions like the following to work, it seems I need
to include the CirculateHit in the Next command.

Since I can find no information in the man page on what application
CirculateHit would have in this position, I wondered if anyone could
tell me if it's legal here, what effect it might have on the Function,
and it's relation to the CirculateSkip and WindowListSkip style
options.


AddToFunc warp-or-run-cmd
+       "I"     None [$0 CirculateHit]       Exec exec $1 &
+       "I"     Next [$0 CirculateHit]       Iconify -1

I find that odd, considering that ftp.hpc.uh.edu is the same machine that
served the web page to you, and the same machine that delivered your mail
to everyone.

The problem is that your DNS servers are messed up, so that your hostname
doesn't exist.  Actually name resolution just hangs until it times out.
You might want to fix that.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I just had a weird experience with a semi-transient window that was spawned by
a Java applet.  Specifically, the window pops up (very briefly) twice and then
disappears under fvwm-2.0.45.  Under <=2.0.43, this window pops up twice and
sticks around the second time, but at an odd position.  Under mwm and dtwm,
this does not occur.  Since the Java applet hangs when the window disappears, I
thought I might pass a long that the changes in HandleUnMapNotify() are what
killed it; I removed the addition to the condition in the first if(...) return;
and the applet once again behaves usably (but still strangely) under 2.0.45. 
This workaround did not affect anything else I used.

P.S.  I can't really give much more info on the applet (proprietary
application), but as I said, I checked with fvwm-2.0.45, fvwm-2.0.43,
fvwm-1.24r, mwm, and dtwm all on AIX 4.2.

This is correct. What you need is the following patch.  I sent this to Chuck 
about a week ago following feedback on my If/IfNot patch (which is obsolete). 
This patch adds the command Current which does the same tests as Next but only 
on the current window.  It also adds the following conditions to 
Next/Prev/None/Current: Raised, Visible, Maximized, Sticky & Transient.  It's 
written in a way that should make adding more condition flags easy.  It also 
lets you put ! in front of the name to negate name matching and fixes a possible 
memory leak.

The downside of this patch is that I couldn't get it to apply with the Animated 
menu/move patch which is really cool.  If I apply the Current patch first it 
gets ignored and it won't apply after the Animated menu/move patch.  PLease, 
please, please can someone get them both working together.

Cheers,
Timbo.

The test conditions in the Next/Prev/None command is complex.  I've just posted 
a patch (under the subject "Re: FVWM: the "Wait" Function") that documents 
things a bit more.  Basically CirculateHit will cause Next/Prev to look at 
windows that have the CirculateSkip style.

There is also the CirculateHitIcon which will make Next/Prev look at _iconified_ 
windows that have the undocumented CirculateSkipIcon style.

Cheers,
imbo.

Hi,

I could not yet manage to have fvwm2 let me place new
windows. At the moment fvwm2 does smart placing first and if
there is not enough room I get the wire frame to do it
myself.

The problem seems to be that you can not change the window
placement style once it has been set for all ("*") windows,
besause there is no RemoveFromStyle command.

Did I miss something? Thank you for any help.

DumbPlacement is the opposite of SmartPlacement.
RandomPlacement is the opposite of ActivePlacement.

I can understand why.  The animation patch has to be one of the worse
patches I've seen.  Large, minorly related sections of code were
re-written to match the author's style of writing.  While I do not
comment on his style, these changes will make future patches die one
of these horrible deaths.


A side question: what will happen with all these patches?  Is there a
list of patches that will be included in the next release, along with
a list of optional patches that will not be?  I've lost track of that
patches I've applied to date.

Can someone tell me how to include modifier keys in .fvwmrc other than
Meta, Ctrl, and Shift?  For example, I want certain key combos to work
w/ or w/out Shift Lock, Caps Lock, etc.  How do I add a line (should be
the same for mouse and key bindings) to .fvwmrc that includes these? 
The man pages only mention the modifiers M,S,C,and A for any.  Thanks in
advance,
		Broc

I have my application running which need to pick up resources information
from my resource files.
Everything is fine except the geometry. (x, y, height and width).

Example,
     Application MYAPP
     in resource file MYAPP.config, I have,
     *.MYAPP.x: 1
     *.MYAPP.y: 1
     *.MYAPP.width: 560
     *.MYAPP.height: 105
     *.MYAPP.background: Gray40
     *.MYAPP.title: Program MyApp

the Fvwm win manager takes background and title, but ignores the geometry
setting.

Am I misunderstanding something? Or what is the answer to this question?

Scott

It also says that the X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as 
digits 1 through 5.  So, you need to use xmodmap (or xkeycaps) to make your 
desired keys into modifiers, and then you can bind to them.  You'll probably 
find that Alt already has a modifier, so you could use that straight away, but 
there's always Super and Hyper left over, if you want yet more, although you 
probably won't have enough modifiers to give them all.

I believe it should be like this:

Hi all, 
I'm having some trouble with fvwm 2.0.44.
I'm running Linux (2.1.42) 32M RAM, a small swap (19Mb) but enough for
me.
I'm a long run user, I use and install fvwm on sun, solaris and linux
my .fvwm2rc is, probably messed up, but tested.
I've changed lately everything on my computer (Kernel, XFree, Fvwm 
(I was using 2.0.42), XEmacs). 
For this reason I tried many configurations before starting to complain.

The problem is that when I close a window, an application or whatever
the system freeze up, the window disappear but there's still a 'shadow'
in the
pager.
No, I don't use destroy. C-x C-x in XEmacs is enough for this behaviour,
'exit' in a window...
In my CDROM, rpm doesn't distribute fvmw2* but fvwm 1.? and fvwm95
(2.0.42)
I tried fvwm95 and everything works.

Am I missing anything ?

I recompiled fvwm with debug on, redirected the stderr and the
_summarized_
result is:

[FVWM][main]: <<DEBUG>> Entered, about to parse args
[FVWM][main]: <<DEBUG>> Done parsing args
[FVWM][main]: <<DEBUG>> Installing signal handlers

'/usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2'
[FVWM][main]: <<DEBUG>> Done running config_commands
[FVWM][main]: <<DEBUG>> Entering HandleEvents loop...

Some errors in .fvwm2rc ... :(
And then a long series of, with few differences:

[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> taking care of queued up events &
returning
[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered

[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> taking care of queued up events &
returning
[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered

and last lines are:
[FVWM][DispatchEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Leaving Routine
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> Routine Entered
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> no X events waiting - about to reap
children
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> waiting for module input/output
[FVWM][My_XNextEvent]: <<DEBUG>> calling FlushQueue

I tried Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, FvwmButtons disappear but the screen is
still
in 'vga mode'. No command accepted, mouse locked

        TIA
        Stefano

There seeems to be a problem with executing Stick on a window that in not Sticky 
and is not on the current desk.  Suppose I am in desk 0 and thw window I am 
interested in is in desk 1 only (not sticky).  If I execute:

Next [window-name] Stick

from FvwmTalk I would expect the window to appear in the current desk.  It 
doesn't appear but Windowlist lists the window  with the S flag, FvwmIconMan 
shows that the window should be in this desk and Next/Prev behave as if it were. 
To all intents and purposes the window does appear in the desk but it is not 
mapped.  I can restore harmony by repeating

Next [window-name] Iconify

twice.  This is repeatable on a HP-UX 10.20 system running 2.0.45 unpatched.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

Tim (and anyone on the discussion list),

A challenge for you.  I took your advice, and (in the interest of full flexibility),
changed the function to the following:

##############################################################################
## If the window is not existing or iconified, call createraisemove
## to bring it up (create/raise) and place it in the correct position
## (move).  Otherwise, just bring it back to the top wherever it is.
##  This way, we only move it when its new or iconified.
##
AddToFunc RaiseFocus-Named-Xterm
+       "I"     Next [$0]               Raise-Named-Xterm $0 $1 $2
+       "I"     None [!iconic $0]       CreateRaiseMove-Named-Xterm $0 $1 $2
 
##
## If the window does not exist, create it and wait for it to appear.
## Then, warp to it, raise it, and move it to where it belongs
##
AddToFunc CreateRaiseMove-Named-Xterm
+       "I"     Exec echo Starting CreateRaiseMove-Named-Xterm
+       "I"     None [$0]       Exec echo Creating $0 at $1 $2
+       "I"     None [$0]       Exec exec xterm -name $0 -title $0 -bg bisque2 -\
fg black \
                       -geometry =81x57+1+1 -sl 6000 -sb -cn -vb -cu -j  \
                       -rw -sk -si &
+       "I"     Exec echo Done Creating, if I did so
+       "I"     Exec echo Waiting on $0
+       "I"     Wait $0
+       "I"     Exec echo Warping
+       "I"     Next [$0]       WarpToWindow 50 50
+       "I"     Exec echo Raising
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Raise
+       "I"     Exec echo Focusing
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Focus
+       "I"     Exec echo Animating
+       "I"     Next [$0]       AnimatedMove $1p $2p
+       "I"     Exec echo Done
 
##
## If the window exists, we get here and just Raise and Focus the window
##
AddToFunc Raise-Named-Xterm
+       "I"     Exec echo Starting Raise-Named-Xterm
+	"I"	Next [$0]	Iconify -1
+       "I"     Exec echo Warping to window
+       "I"     Next [$0]       WarpToWindow 50 50
+       "I"     Exec echo Raising
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Raise
+       "I"     Exec echo Focusing
+       "I"     Next [$0]       Focus
+       "I"     Exec echo Done
##############################################################################

Yes, a bit verbose, but you'll see why.  I also know I am not
guaranteed of the echo's and commands being executed in order.

If I restart, and press the mouse button to activate this with the
call "RaiseFocus-Named-Xterm Left 7 13", I get the following on my
console:

>Starting CreateRaiseMove-Named-Xterm
>Done Creating, if I did so
>Waiting on Left
>Warping
>Raising
>Focusing
>Animating
>Done

[Notice we do not see the message "Creating Left at 7 13"!!]

A window is correctlyt created here.  If I then move the window a bit,
maybe placing it behind something, and then press the button again, I
get (as expected):

>Starting Raise-Named-Xterm
>Warping to window
>Raising
>Focusing
>Done

**BUT ONSCREEN**, something else is happening!  Namely, the window has
an AnimatedMove done to it to move it back to it's home position, even
though this does not happen in the function!

Sometimes, some of those messages do not appear, and the window is not
acted upon by the nearby commands.  i.e. Focusing and Done may not
appear, and the window will not have the cursor in it.

Any ideas on what's going on?

-Wolf

I built fvwm 2.0.45 for IRIX 6.3.  I didn't use gcc.  It works fine most
of the time, but often freezes for a few seconds.

Usually, keyboard and mouse freeze up for 5-6 seconds, then for another
5-6 seconds an instant later, and then a third time...then things will
be fine for an hour.

Sometimes, only the mouse freezes up and I can use the keyboard if I
have focus.  

Other times, everything freezes up tight and hangs there until I log in
from a remote terminal and restart the X server.

I've applied the X server patches.  I also installed the replacement
motherboard SGI shipped me.  

Does anyone else have experiences, good or bad, with fvwm under IRIX
6.3?  Many thanks...

I work at a large corporation and have tried to convert their
Huge olwm root-menus to fvwm (olwm sucks). Everything went well 
until I started getting error messages like:

Popup/Function Matlab ignored, you have more than 50 

I get lots of these every time I restart fvwm. My questions is: 
1. Is there a way to get around the max 50 limit without recompiling 
fvwm from source?
2. If not, what do I have to do to recompile fvwm.

Thanks in advance for fast answers.

This limit is in fvwm version 1.xx only (2.xx doesn't have any limit
like this).

You would have to recompile 1.xx to get around it (look in the
README.Install file for instructions).  Look in menus.h for the
MAXPOPUPS define and make it bigger (say 200).  Or switch to version
2.xx (it is still in beta but more than stable enough to use).

If you do switch to the latest 2.xx beta (2.0.45 right now but 2.0.46
will be out as soon as I actually get a chance to do some more work on
it), the syntax of the rc file has changed.  There is a script in the
tar file that may help you do the conversions.

I am using fvwm95-2.0.42a on Solaris 2.4 and 2.5.

I have my application called Launcher. In my resource file Launcher.rf, I
have

*Launcher.geometry: 200x100+1+1
*Launcher*defaultFontList:
-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--17-120-100-100-p-92-iso8859-1

question1.
The first line of the resource hides the 2nd line. That means, if I reorder
these two lines, the geometry
information is lost.

Question 2.
Should the unit of the dimension come from the definition in
*Launcher*defaultFontList?

Hi all,


1. I would like to know if the 'extras' module in fvwm-2.0.45 is important ?

2.  Does the Imakefile in the top-level of fvwm-2.0.45 work ?
 Because, I got these erros msg:

I' m using the fvwm prior to the version 2.0.45 and I have trouble
in my .fvwmrc to configure the FvwmPager.

For example there are features like :
DeskTopSize 6x2
that I don' t fint in the FvwmPager manuals at the :

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/FvwmPager-man.html

and in particular the :

*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Main
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 SBKiller
*FvwmPagerLabel 2 Chaos
*FvwmPagerLabel 3 MP2
*FvwmPagerLabel 4 Lego2
*FvwmPagerLabel 5 Lego4
*FvwmPagerLabel 6 SBDebug
*FvwmPagerLabel 7 LDebug


They don' t work.

  Is anybody can help me to have a list of the attributes not listed in the
manual pages and more to label the views of the FvwmPager ?

Thanks.

   Massimo.

Is it 2.x?

That's because it isn't part of the pager.  This command is for fvwm
itself.

I use them all the time.  Are those lines above exactly what you have in
your .fvwm2rc file?

I think you must have something else wrong somewhere.  My biggest problem
now is that error reporting in Fvwm doesn't seem to be real good.  It is
very hard to find out exactly what in your rc file is causing problems.
This seems to be more of a problem with the modules however.

I am running fvwm95.  I have a online dictinary and an appointment
calander that I keep active but iconified most of the time.  When I
activate them, I would like them to come up on the page I am currently
on, not drag me back to the page where the app was iconified.  I have
done the rtfm and don't see how this is accomplished.  Any help would be
appreciated.

thanks

I'm guessing that you're misunderstanding the difference between pages
and desks.  The

*FvwmPagerLabel

directive lets you label a desk, not a page.  If your fvwm desktop
(btw, DeskTopSize is in the fvwm man page, not FvwmPager, since its
part of the wm itself) is 6x2 then it sounds like you might actually
want to set DeskTopSize to 1x1 and then run FvwmPager 0 11 and set

*FvwmPagerRows 2

The desks that show up should be labeled.  Also make sure you set the
font.  Note that if you do this you lose the ability to use
edgescrolling, which only moves between pages, not desks.

All the above refers to fvwm2.  I don't remember if it worked the same
way in fvwm1.

What is the definition of "Close", "Delete", "Destroy" built-in commands of

Thanks,

I'm running 2.x, but since 95 is based on 2.x, the following should work.

I do what you're asking with netscape (and other apps), defined as a
button under FvwmButtons: 

##################
Style "Netscape"    NoIcon

AddToFunc NetscapeFunction "I" Next [Netscape] Iconify 1
+		           "I" Next [Netscape] Iconify -1
+		           "I" Next [Netscape] Focus
+			   "I" None [Netscape] Exec netscape -install

*FvwmButtons "" mini.netscape.xpm NetscapeFunction
##################

I'm not sure the NoIcon is necessary.  Anyway, the key is to force
iconification (`Iconify 1') first, so that when the window is de-iconified
(`Iconify -1'), it's brought up in the current window.  Admittedly, this
is sort of a hack.  Ideally, I suppose it would be best if WindowDesk did
the same thing, but that doesn't appear to be an option. 

If anyone has a better (more elegant) solution, I'd love to hear it.

I am invoking fvwm-2.0.43 via .xinitrc as follows:
  fvwm -f "FvwmCpp ~./.fvwm2rc"
I have verified that cpp is not choking on any comments in .fvwm2rc.
I have also not embedded any logic into .fvwm2rc, since I still
haven't been able to get fvwm to digest the pre-processed config file.
After X has launched, I'm left with a blank, brain dead fvwm session.
When I exit X, these errors are all the clues that are left:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2
ELF
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2

I have sifted through the mail archives, but haven't been able to figure
this out.
Hopefully my ignorance has been well presented, and the solution will
trivial.

heheh... it is... I had the same problem too :) The fvwm command ISN'T -f
to invoke a module or something, it's -cmd ... Therefore:

		fvwm -cmd "FvwmCpp ~/.fvwm2rc"

would be the correct syntax. This is change that will hopefully be
reflected in the next release's man page (it's incorrect in the current
one...) Enjoy!

Hi all,

We have a separate module which is spawned by 'fvwm-2.0.45'.  But that
module is core dump immediately at the beginning, I couldn't attach to its
process.  Anyone know how to debug it ? 

'fvwm2' is still running after the core-dump of the separate module.

Thank you,

Quoc.

We've noticed that the "StartIconic" style command is broken in Fvwm 2.0.45.
It actually does iconify things when they startup, the problem is that it also
iconifies any dialog boxes or sub-windows that come up during application use
(which is probably not what is intended). This really confused one poor user
when he hit a modal dialog in Netscape (preferences) & the icon went somewhere
else, so he thought it was hung. 

Also, I don't understand why my setting the "MODALITY_IS_EVIL" compile flag
doesn't have any affect on the Netscape 3.01's preferences menu coming up 
modal.

Hi all,

I would like to know if it is possible to "raise a window when it is
totally overlapped by other(s)" ?

I'm using fvwm-2.0.45.

thanks,

Quoc.

Yes.

You can choose the window from the WindowList. It will raise the
window to the top and take you to whatever screen it is on.

Anybody know how to do this from the command line?  Maybe like 
FvwmIdent, but from the command line.  I figure something like FvwmPERL
could do the job, but we are still running on fvwm2.043.  Any ideas?

For any Xt-based application, it's much better to start it with the -iconic
flag as that only affects the initial window of the application.  Not every
other window that it ever creates.

It seems that fvwm ought to be able to do the same thing, but it seems
harder to do in a window manager than in the application...and not worth the
bother of doing when most applications are based upon Xt and already support
the -iconic flag.

I can't but you can send a message to LISTSERV@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU.  I can't
remember the exact format but if you make the body of the message "Help"
it'll tell you what to do.

I am still hanging on these problems which I posted last week. Could you
please
send me a copy of email for the answer?   swu@i-o.com

I am using fvwm95-2.0.42a on Solaris 2.4 and 2.5.

I have my application called Launcher. In my resource file Launcher.rf, I
have

*Launcher.geometry: 200x100+1+1
*Launcher*defaultFontList:
-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--17-120-100-100-p-92-iso8859-1

question1.
The first line of the resource hides the 2nd line. That means, if I reorder
these two lines, the geometry
information is lost.

Question 2.
Should the unit of the dimension come from the definition in
*Launcher*defaultFontList?

Hi

I'm trying to compile fvwm 2.045 and have a small problem.  When I go to
build the make files - This is the result:

making top level make file
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
done

making makefile in libs
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
makefile:531 *** missing separator stop
done

The program continues to duck in and out of the remaining directories -
complaining about the missing separator at each one.  Any idea what I am
doing wrong??

Thanks.

Hi,

quick question: how to make Netscape Mail sticky, without
making any other Netscape windows follow me around. And no,
the obvious "Style Netscape*Mail Sticky" doesn't seem to
work, even though that approach does work in every other
context I try. 

I'm using fvwm 2.0.42 on a Solaris 2.5 box with X11R6.
The offending Netscape is Navigator v3.01 for Solaris.
It's really annoying to have to keep manually making
my mailer sticky when I log on!

Any help much appreciated,

Simon

Oops, I'll try that again.  The message body didn't seem to come
through; I've checked my Sent box and it looks ok...

I'm a new arrival in the world of FVWM, Motif, X, AIX, RS6000s et al,
having been doing PC development for the last 6 years.  I'd like to keep
the signal to noise ratio as low as possible; does anyone know of any
other mailing lists that might be useful to me so that I don't ask too
many irrelevant questions here?

here's my line from my .fvwm2rc:
Style "Mail" IconBox -60 120 -1 -140, NoIconTitle, StickyIcon, 		     
Slippery, WindowListSkip

by using stickyicon, the icon follows me around, i can open it on a
page, and the window will stay put.

note: this is for netscape 3.x (and probably 2.x).  when 4.0 is fully
released i'll figure it out for that....

(some one else on this list told me about stickyicon, glad i've had a
chance to return the favor.

hello to all.
like a few people I like the windowshade command. thanks to whoever
wrote it. however I use it in a similar way to inconify.

what I would like is for a window that has been shaded and then inconified
to revert to full when it is deiconified.

perhaps including windowshade into the iconify function would work.

you could then have something like

iconify 2 	for windowshade. (perhaps keep an alias so that 
		windowshade could continue to be used as a command)

then 
iconify -1 	would deiconify to full yet the actions of iconify and
		windowshade you remain spearate for each other to the user.

hopefully these changes will not involve too much coding.

thanks

Graeme

No coding is required at all:

AddToFunc "iconshade" "I" WindowShade
+                     "I" Iconify

Try the following:

Hi,

I'm having great difficulty compiling fvwm2 on Solaris 5.5 as we do not
have Imake installed.  I can't get Imake installed quickly becasue I am
not sytem admin, it will take them a long time to get around to installing
it.

Therefore, in the short term, could someone offer me their makefiles that
have been processed for Solaris 5.5 ?

Thanks,
Andy

Hi all,

I've been using fvwm2 (and fvwm1 before) for some years now and I've
just subscribed to this here mailing list. I thought I'd take the
opportunity to contribute some questions/comments.

Why are the Color and HilightColor commands so different? The syntax is
different ("color1 color2" vs. "color1/color2"), the places where they
can be used (in a Style vs. at the top-level), the one doesn't accept
an "rgb:rr/gg/bb" color spec and the other does, the one can be split
into a BackColor and a ForeColor and the other can't. I end up having
to specify normal and hilighted colors in different places and in
different ways, which looks really awkward.

I want my multiple icon boxes back! Part of my desktop used to look like
this:

+-------+-------+   First IconBox 1 would fill up, and then it would
|       |       |   "spill over" into IconBox 2. With 2.0 that's no
| Icon- |       |   longer possible (other than defining different
| Box 1 | Icon- |   icon boxes for different programs, which I don't
|       | Box 2 |   want). I also don't want to use the IconBox
+-------+       |   module because it takes up desktop space with
|Xfaces |       |   its own window.
+-------+-------+

I would like to be able to define shortcuts for menu entries at
the same time as I define the menu entries themselves, with the
AddToMenu function. Now they are defined in different places,
which doesn't help in keeping them consistent.

Regards,				- Jacco

I'd just like to thank Bruce Stephens <B.Stephens@isode.com> for sending
me all of his Makefiles for FVWM2 on Solaris 5.5 last night.  I'd spent
several hours trying to get Imake to work, but a quick email to the FVWM
mailing list and 30 minutes later I have FVWM compiling away merrily.

This kind of thing really restores my faith in the internet community!
Thanks!

ObFVWM: Does anyone know of some web pages with lots of unofficial patches
to FVWM?  (Don't worry, this is for Linux with a working Imake!)  Also a
library of config files would be nice.

Thanks again,
Andy

Dear fvwm user,
	i use fvwm2 win. manager with an alpha/UNIX station.
I use the FvwmButtons to launch some program, e.g. netscape,
using the following command:
*FvwmButtons WWW  ghost.xbm Exec "" /usr/local/bin/netscape-gold3.0 -display $HOST':0.' &

Netscape starts correctly, but some environment that is set in my .login is not present,
e.g. the PATH variable. This causes some trouble because netscape fails 
to find some applications such as ghostview, gunzip and other.

My question is: it is possible to start direcly netscape (or other applications)
preserving the settings done in .login and co.?   

			thanx Ciao Stefano

Is there any way to list only iconified windows in FvwmIconMan?
Basically, something analogous to the OnlyIcons option for WindowList.

Thanks,

-Rob

Yes.  In your .xsession file (or whatever file you use to start up
fvwm2), source the .login file BEFORE calling fvwm2.  That way, the
environment variables are inherited by fvwm2, which will be passed
along to whatever applications are started by fvwm2.

For me, this Style entries are working:

Style  "Netscape"                MiniIcon mini-nscape.xpm, NoPPosition
Style  "Navigator"               Icon netscape3.xpm
#Style  "Netscape News:*"
Style  "Netscape Mail"           Icon MailBox.xpm
#Style  "Netscape: Bookmarks"
#Style  "Netscape: Address Book"

bye,
   Lars

I think this is historical. The HilightColor command existed long
before Style "*" Color was created. I agree with you that it is
not very intuitive. Now we have the new decors it is possible to
get some strange and counterintuitive interactions between
BorderStyle, Color and HilightColor.

In my opinion this should all be rewritten as part of the
Great Style Flag rewrite. And so I come to a proposal I'd like
to put to Chuck and the others.

I think fvwm-2.0.45 is pretty stable (more stable than a lot of software
I use!). How about freezing the features and releasing it as 2.1,
then having parallel releases: 2.x will just be bug fixes for the
current feature set, while 3.x (or whatever) will have all the
code rewrites people have been planning for so long. People adding
features will be encouraged to add them to the cleaner code
of the 3.x betas.

It strikes me that Chuck spends a lot of time adding and debugging
all the great new features that people keep writing, and we'll
never get to 2.1 and begin the GSFR at this rate.

Just my 2c. Comments?

No, but that would be cool. I'll add it. It won't be hard.

I disagree with the statement that fvwm-2.0.45 is pretty stable. I'm still
using fvwm 1.x because of a bug in the FvwmButtons module. I've written to the
list before about this, and got no response, other than from other people with
the same problem. The problem is that I can't get FvwmButtons to appear, quite
a fundamental problem with fvwm I would say. The only advice I've been able to
get is use the FvwmButtons module from 2.0.41. Unfortunately, this didn't work
for me, so I'm still using fvwm 1.x.

Whether the next beta after 2.1 is 2.2 or 3.0 depends on the scope of
the changes - what you are mentioning above perhaps falls about
halfway between what I imagine would be a 2.2 and a 3.0 version (which
path to take I've been oscillating on).  I'll explain more below
(briefly).

Richard> It strikes me that Chuck spends a lot of time adding and debugging

More or less correct...  I've been trying to limit features to help
get 2.1 out easier, but incorporating patches is always a pain because
my development level usually changes shortly after I release a beta
version and patches often overlap files & throw off lines (sometimes
overlap lines too).  Plus as some people have noticed, I like to
reimplement things sometimes...

Richard> Just my 2c. Comments?

My thoughts - I would like to get at least one more beta out before
2.1.  Then what to do for the next beta after that?

(This is all breifly written, because I have to get back to work and
typing this note between working on things is becoming distracting)

I've toyed with the idea of the next one being a big rewrite, beyond
just what I had in mind for the GSFR (this would be 3.x).  Clean more
stuff up, change rc syntax again (built in language, but add ways to
change to other scripting languages for the folks who would like
that), change module stuff (dynamic loading instead of or in addition
to a cleaned up socket communications protocol), etc.  Essentially
redesign it.  Scary thought, no?

What I had in mind initially for 2.2.x was the GSFR and various
associated cleanups, maintaining essentially the same rc syntax but
clean up parts of it (mostly for consistency between commands), add
some new features & bugfixes that are currently needed (eventually
including some of those that would be for 3.x).  Then 2.3 official
could be releases, and then probably move on to 3.x...

What does everyone else think?  The latter is probably safer, but I
find the former more appealing...

Most important for me to do in the immediate future is to actually
finish up the next beta... :) Sorry it's taking so long (again).

Hm...  I have to say that I think fvwm itself is relatively stable and
usable (am I biased?), but there will always be bugs and there will
often times be ones that some people see that others don't (and if one
of those others happens to be me, as it often is, then debugging some
problems is difficult).

Various people have had different problems with FvwmButtons,
especially since I accepted Jarl's rewrite - it doesn't handle the
older syntax well sometimes and this is often the problem.

Can you get a *simple* FvwmButtons example to work?  Something like a
single button (no pixmap) that beeps?  Just copy these two into
FvwmTalk and see if it works:

  *SimpleButtons(Title beep Action Beep)
  FvwmButtons SimpleButtons

If it does work ok, then work your way up through more complex
examples.  Perhaps this will help you figure out what's wrong.  Or
perhaps you can post to the list what your rc file was trying to do
and some kind soul who has some time might be able help.

Other alternatives - try FvwmGoodStuff (which is the pre-rewritten
FvwmButtons), FvwmScript, or tkgoodstuff.  The first two are in the
extras dir in the 2.0.45 distribution.

[On a side note, eventually (3.x?) I'd like to combine features of
FvwmButtons, FvwmForm, & FvwmScript to make one super usable module
(FvwmGUI or something like that)...]

Ok, this has all taken way too long to type - gotta go.  Hopefully
everything I've written here is coherent and actually what I meant. :)

I've been using fvwm2 for two years now, supporting many users
running a large variety of configurations on lots of platforms:
Linux 1.x and 2.x, Irix 5.3 and 6.x, Solaris 2.3-2.5, even an Acorn
RISCiX box (how many of you have seen one of those? :-). I'm very
happy with the stability of the code.

Why not send your config for FvwmButtons again and I'll try to
reproduce the problem.

Also, FvwmButtons is a module. I don't think the window manager
releases should be held up because any modules are still in
beta. That's one of the advantages of having a module interface.
Would you suggest mwm wasn't a stable window manager? It doesn't
have a buttons module at all!

By the way, last days I tried to figure out what a shell startet
from fvwm would inherit. So I defined a Menu entry like this:

+  "show env"                     Exec typeset

I then get a list of env vars to fvwms standart out. Can I be sure this
is the environment fvwm inherits from xinit ?

Erm, this is more than `slightly off topic', but I'd suggest asking on
comp.unix.aix, or reading the FAQ for comp.text.tex as it contains a list
of places to obtain TeX.

Well, I was thinking as I read this that you're precisely describing
the GIMP's (version 0.99 beta) PDB (procedural database).  (Except for
the part about dynamic loading, since the PDB uses pipes.)  I don't
claim to know well FVWM's module subsystem, but I know the GIMP's
plug-in system pretty well, and it might just be possible to bolt in
some code from the GIMP to FVWM.  Problem is, the GIMP's GPL'ed, so you
run the risk of infecting your own code. *sigh*

Anyway, the GIMP's home site is
http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp/gimp.html , if you're interested. 
That's my $1/50th.

Sorry for posting this silly question...

I just want to know if anybody ported fvwm to Xfree86 OS/2.
Perhaps yopu could send me a cookie?

Thanks, Steffen

Hi,

I want to ask whether there are any plans to make fvwm compliant to 
X11R6's session management. I think that there is a great
perspective for new functionality when fvwm was extended. New modules
could take advantage of the additional information xmsp provides (unique
identification of windows across sessions, grouping of windows according
to application instances,...). Even the session manager itself could be a
module which might use the module interface to restore geometry of windows
when sessions are restarted. 

We are currently developing a similar module for a research project which
will enable users to manage task-related groups of windows instead of
single windows. Also, we have patched or will patch our local copy of fvwm
to inegrate multi window operations like "move group of windows", "resize 
group of windows" etc. So I'd like to ask the members of this list what
they think about such kinds of modifications and what feature requests for
task-related window manipulations they might have.

Due to our local patches to fvwm (which are for version 2.0.43), I cannot
promise that we are able to provide a module for the baseline
version of fvwm but would appreciate any comments. 


Thanks,


Stefan.

I seem to have been flamed for asking about TeX on AIX.

I realise it is off-topic which is why I prefixed the subject line with
"slightly off-topic", and I didn't realise that the group's tolerance
was below average (other groups I belong to are usually happy to help
when someone has tried to ask the right questions in the right order).

May I point any more potential flamers to my original message, to which
I have so far received _no_ helpful replies:


I'm a new arrival in the world of FVWM, Motif, X, AIX, RS6000s et al,
having been doing PC development for the last 6 years.  I'd like to keep
the signal to noise ratio as low as possible; does anyone know of any
other mailing lists that might be useful to me so that I don't ask too
many irrelevant questions here?


I realise a simple web search will answer the question but a simple web
search is not simple for someone who only has email access!

Thanks in advance for any constructive replies.

perhaps you should let us know what the problem with FvwmButtons is 
before condemning it and the whole of fvwm2.

i use fvwm2.0.45 with the included FvwmButtons and it works perfectly...

What do we think about what?  I think just about any of the fvwm2 beta
releases could have been released without the word "beta" attached.  I
think most people have caught  on and realize that  fvwm2 is not  beta
quality, its fully functional.

I think  releasing  fvwm2  as a   non-beta  release will   gather some
attention and may even get someone to contribute patches for the GSFR.

As far as the changes you describe, I would lean toward maintaining rc
file  compatibility unless   there was a  really  big  payoff for  the
change.  Shared  libraries (dynamic loading) would  be nice,  but most
users wouldn't even notice.

Hey, until we start paying you, how can we complain?

In fact no one's complaining, everyone here loves fvwm2 even if it is
perpetually beta.

I tried something very much like this and it works.  However, I noticed
that I get a beep whenever I deiconify a window that was maximized. 
This is because you can't (un)shade a maximized window.  Anyone have an
idea how to get around it?

While I'm at it, is there a way I can make AutoRaise do nothing if I
happen to have the mouse button down?  I keep losing my popup menus
when the application window "fronts" over them.

They would sure notice if it allowed the writing of even more cool modules,
like modules that would change the "look and feel" of fvwm, like afterstep and
fvwm95 did, but without having to split the source.

Can someone point me to a howto on designing custom window buttons or
point me to a list of examples? What I would like to do is take the
standard minimize, maximize buttons and modify them..

Thanks.

MenuStyle allows the user to specify the color of the text and
background for menus, but is there any option/command to change the
colors used to hilight the current button pressed or the little
triangles used to denote a submenu?  I'd like to use light text on a
dark background, but then I cannot see the button I'm over being
highlighted.

If you have applied the "Current" patch you can replace
+ "I" windowshade 2
with
+ "I" Current [!Maximized] windowshade 2

Hi Everyone

I've been experimenting with fvwm2 and have really enjoyed it.  I need a
little help with a few points that I can't seem to clear up.

First, I have not benn sucessful in getting FVWM buttons to swallow a
digital clock (month/day/date - red on black background).  Second, I
haven't been able to get buttons to swallow a pager (any
configuration).  These pager function has been included in several
example .fvwm2rc's I have found - unfortunately none of these work on my
machine.

One last problem.  I keep getting messages to the effect that the
colormap is full.  I've tried using the command for colormap focus
following the mouse and the focus - no positive results.  I'm running a
cheap 2 meg trident tgui card at 1024 x 768.  When I try to remove the 8
bit depth entry from XF86Config - X complains that the default depth
entry is missing and refuses to engage.

Any solutions would be greatly appreciated.

I used to use this, before I switched to asclock (available from
http://rif3.iiic.ethz.ch:1313/spiff/asclock/):

*FvwmButtons(5x1, Frame 0, Swallow "xclock" "Exec xclock -d -update 1
-bg Black -fg LimeGreen -padding 4
-fn '-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' &")

Note: I've inserted carriage returns for readability ... remove them before
use.

How about something like this:

*FvwmButtons(3x2, Frame -2, Back #908090, Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

Something's eating all your colours. Netscape is a frequent offender.
Try 'netscape -install'. It could also be lots of multicoloured icons
being used by fvwm2.

I don't know about the capabilities of your card. You can try replacing
the 8 with 16 (or even 24). You may need to reduce the resolution to
get it to work. Try to find out what resolutions and depths are
supported by your card.

The problem with using xclock in this way is that the digital clock
isn't very configurable... you cannot select exactly how the digital
display will be viewed.  I also remember problem with resizing the
window and not having the display center properly.  Yet another
limitation is that the clock has no interaction... it cannot be used
to launch an application or do anything useful.

In the past, I have found that when I want something (like a
programmable "biff") that isn't already a standard utility, the
fastest way to create such a facility is with tcl/tk.

So, I created a useful digital clock using tcl/tk and FvwmCommand. 
Feel free to use this, modify it, and do anything you want with it.

I've started playing with decors and I'm getting confused.  I've created a menu 
that is intended to change the decors of all the windows on the scren without 
the visual disturbance of recapture.  Here's the RC stuff (Sorry about the line 
wrap):

AddToMenu menu_decor
+ "WM Style"	Title
+ "&Default"	decor_fvwm
+ "&Pixmap"	decor_pixmap

AddToFunc decor_fvwm	"I" DestroyDecor my_decor
+			"I" UpdateDecor my_decor

AddToFunc decor_pixmap	"I" DestroyDecor my_decor
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor WindowFont BOLD_MEDIUM
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap 
pool.xpm -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor BorderStyle InActive TiledPixmap 
concrete.xpm -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor TitleStyle Height 16 -- Flat
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- 
UseBorderStyle Sunk
+			"I" AddToDecor my_decor HilightColor FG TS
+			"I" UpdateDecor my_decor

Style "*" UseDecor my_decor

Here is what happens:
decor_fvwm works as expected.  All windows return to the default FVWM look.
decor_pixmap doesn't work as expected.  All windows remain with the FVWM look 
until a recapture is executed.  Even then the titlebars remain in the FVWM look 
until the window has been focused.

Am I doing the wrong thing here?
Tim Phipps.

Hi

I'm currently running 2.0.45 with the buttons module.  On starting FVWM,
the button configuration appears every time like clockwork.  I will open
an xterm, enlarge it to cover the button box, do some FTP/telnet work. 
When finished, I'll minimise the xterm, and the button box (with 8
buttons) is gone.  This has happened several times.  

Am I doing something wrong??  Is there a patch or work around??  Thanks
for any help.

If one creates an FvwmButtons button and specifies actions for mouse 1
and mouse 2, and then presses mouse 3 on it, the entire FvwmButtons
will die.  Granted, this can be prevented by specifying a mouse 3
action or a default action, but couldn't it also just beep or
something if there is no action?  Segfaulting seems a little harsh.

I'm constantly pushing and pulling windows around and a thought had come
while doing so, recently. Since I am not a proficient coder yet, perhaps
one of the fvwm developers would care to adopt my idea--friction/slide; a
realistic way to "throw" a window.

For instance, I wish to take a window in screen A and move it to screen B
(to clear up clutter).. I drag the window and let go of the moose button
while it is still moving..moments later, it slows down and stops (as any
ordinary element would when obstructed by friction).

If this sounds wack.. It probably is. Is there a way to make a window move
to another screen easier than moving it, changing screens, moving it..?

You can move a window to another desk by middle (both if you only have two muttons)
clicking its window in the pager and dragging it to the desk that you want.

I tend to use WindowShade as a clutter reducer.  That might also have the
desired net effect.

This is a neat idea.  There are times when a window is in my way, and
I want it somewhere else - over there to the right, say - but I don't
really care exactly where.  I click, I toss, it moves and glides to
halt as I bring into focus the window underneath.

Gives a new meaning to "throwing an xterm," too.

OK, I've RT'd the FM :-), checked the archives, sacrificed a black
chicken at midnight on the night of a full moon...

And I still can't get ClickToFocus to work with the num lock key or the
scroll lock key on.

The archives mention a problem when a mouse button is bound with no
modifiers (N) but all of my mouse binding accept any modifier (A).  So I
don't think that is the problem.

The windows will raise, lower, resize, move, etc ust like they're
supposed to.  Menus pop-up as expected. The only thing missing is the
focus!

If I change the setting to SloppyFocus or MouseFocus the focus changes
as expected.

I am using

	Linux 2.0.27	(i386)
	XFree86-3.2  	(XF86_SVGA)
	fvwm 2.0.45	(From the RedHat 4.1 distribution) 

I've set the reply-to to my e-mail address.

How do I get FvwmButtons/Swallow to "intercept" mouse clicks, instead
of passing them onto the swallowed application?  For example:

*FvwmButtons(2x1 Size 64 64 Frame -3 Swallow(Respawn,NoHints) asclock \
       `Exec exec asclock -12 -noblink`, Action RunCm)

If I click on the app, the event is passed onto asclock, instead of
running RunCm.  Note that if I click on the frame, then RunCm executes.  I
want RunCm to always execute. 

An fix might be, at least for asclock, is that asclock has a `exe' option,
which allows you to specify a program to run when it's clicked on. 
Unfortunately, it's not clear how I can get a script to communicate with
fvwm2 to run RunCm (I couldn't get FvwmCommand to work on my system). 

Thanks for any suggestions,

-Rob

You can't do it. The click is always passed to the swallowed app. The
only way is to define a Title and click on that. 

Maybe in a future version ...

Hi all,

I would like to know if it's possible to configure the button style so that
each APPLICATION window will have specific button style on it.

i.e. button style is not the same for all windows.

Thank you,

Quoc.

Yes, this would in theory be better, more complete.  Especially for
app menus that you can click once and it stays up.

Is a menu, such as the drop down menus in Netscape, considered a
transient?  Is it possible for AutoRaise to act on all the transients
of a window?

It would be quite a good thing, too, if the window could be dragged from the
screen into the pager.


And, as a sideline, does anyone know of a 5-button moose with a documented
protocol?  I have a Mouse Systems ProAgio, but those idiots won't release
any programming information on it and I just don't much feel like reverse
engineering it.  Three buttons is never enough!

Hi everybody,
I'm trying to minimize my time, while trying to maximize my I/O (:-)).
I'm so used to Wintel's Alt+Space shortcut to show
Window-Ops I;m trying to implement it in Linux.
I issued a command:

Key Space	A	M	Menu Window-Ops

I also looked into /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h and I think
(thought) I found a key for that -- `space` I tried -it didn't
work.  I checked to see if the whole combination was
right, I substitutted F1 for space -- it worked.
And now I have a plea to anyone that uses `space` short
cut -- *** what key do you use ??? ***

Please reply.

Nikita

I use a similar shortcut - you'll need to use 'space' rather than 'Space'
for it to work (i.e. No initial capital)

On my Solaris machine, the work "space" had to be in lower case.

I want to have something like this in my .fvwm2rc:
  Mouse 1 WTSF    A      Raise
except for the obvious problem that when I have this and I click on the window,
  it is indeed raised, but I can't click on buttons/links/whatever that's in 
the
  window.
Is there a way for fvwm to interpret the mouse down, but also pass it to the
  application?  So that if my Netscape window is visible but not on top, and I
  press a button on it with my mouse, it is raised and the button is pressed as
  well?

It seems that in the situation you describe a NULL pointer gets passed
to mystrncasecmp() which calls strlen() on it without checking and
that causes the segmentation fault.

Attached is a patch which hopefully does what you want. Maybe it would
also be a good idea to make mystrncasecmp() more robust?

By the way: I was looking around the code to see if how fvwm does the beeping.
I found that it always calls XBell(dpy,Scr.screen). I just don't understand
why this is better than XBell(dpy, 0). What am I missing?

Cheers,
Thomas

Everyone knows how to cause certain applications to start on certain
desktops, but how do we make sure they take vacant pages (if
available)?

I have a bunch of desktops called "Bash," "Emacs," "Netscape," and so
on, each for the obvious apps.  I often run four or five copies of
emacs and at least a few shells, and I like being able to just click
"local shell" on my menu and have it pop up on the appropriate
desk.  I'd like it even better if it would magically appear on a
vacant page -- right now I have to rearrange the windows every time I
start a new instance of an application.

Any ideas?

Hm.  Does SmartPlacement do something useful?  I use

    GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

to make it even smarter.  But I've never tried to find out what
happens when apps don't appear on the current desk.

OK, I have the following in my .fvwmrc:

,-----
| GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart, ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick, MouseFocusClickRaises
| Style "*"		SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
| Style "*"		NoIcon, SloppyFocus
`-----

This behaves like so: I can click inside any window to raise it, and
the click is passed on to the application.  I can do this right now,
so I know it works.

Were I using ClickToFocus (which I am not), the
ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick would mean that clicking a window to give
it focus does *not* pass the click on to the application, only the
second and subsequent clicks are passed on.

Hi all,

I would like to ask if this configuration is correct, because it doesn't
work for me:

AddToFunc My_function       "I"  Style [$0] BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 1
...
...
...
AddToMenu Window-Ops2 "Resize-border" My_function
...
...
Mouse 2 FST     A       Menu Window-Ops2 Nop



The window border doesn't change the width as I want.


Thank you,

Quoc.

I would like to use a taskbar in fvwm2 but without the fvwm95
decorations - is there one out there that can be used for fvwm2?
Thanks.

fvwm-newbie question:

  At the office, I have my (OpenWindows under Solaris 2.5) menus configured 
  so that xterms for different purposes -- e.g., rlogin-ed to different hosts -- 
  come up using different color schemes.  At home, I'm using fvwm2 & The NextLevel
  menus under Linux (RedHat 4.1, pretty much the defaults; not customized very
  much yet).  How do I do this there -- I want different background colors for
  me-as-user, root, and for each remote machine -- but I don't see an argument
  for the "StartProgramInColorXterm" that lets me pass color-arguments to the
  command line of the Xterm it starts?

Thanks!

FvwmButtons, combined with FvwmIconMan, makes a GREAT task bar.  Here
are the relevant parts of my configuration files.  Please note that
this is hardcoded to my screen size of 1280x1024 -- make changes where
appropriate.

*** end of configuration ***

The tricky part is the three-part FvwmButtons configuration.  The
first part is the Start Menu.  The second part is the IconMan task
bar.  The third part is a "system tray" that launches some desired
applications.

If you understand Fvwm configuration, you should be able to figure out
what my various menus, functions, and programs do.

RTFM , look in the manual (man fvwm2) for "StartsOnDesk". You can give
"Style"s to applications and there you define on which Desk they should
start.

Hope this helps,

AFAIK, they always start on the current Desk. This won't SmartPlacement
won't help here. You might want to try "StartsOnDesk". See the manual.

Fvwm2.0.45 : the man page for FvwmButtons states that the (side) option can be 
used for swallowed windows and pixmaps.  If I try:

*FvwmButtons(Title(side) CPU Swallow xload xload)

The label is drawn in the button until xload and then it is overwritten.  What 
am I doing wrong?

Cheers,
Tim.

Nope.  SmartPlacement only helps place windows on the current
page/screen.  I don't have "GlobalOpts" -- what FVWM are you using?

  How did you get FvwmIconMan to display icons horizontally?  The documentation
I have is for version 0.7 (although when I run it I get version 0.9).
Anyway, the version 0.7 docs say that it only supports vertical arrangement
of icons.  Apparently you must have gotten this to work--the taskbar is
not very useful otherwise.

  Also, where can I get the date.tk script you reference?

  Thanks,

The managergeometry option tells FvwmIconMan to make 5 buttons
verticall and 1 horizontally.  When the sixth button is created,
FvwmIconMan divides them in two columns.  When the 11th button is
created, there are three columns.  And so on.

Here's how it works. It's rather confusing, and I have trouble remembering how
it works sometimes, but it is very efficient:

buttongeometry specifies the initial geometry of each button. If y=0, then
FvwmIconMan set it according to the font size. 

managergeometry specifies the initial size of the manager window, in units of
buttons. There are three cases:

height=0, width > 0: manager has "width" columns, and grows the manager
vertically as needed. If there are fewer than "width" buttons, then the
buttons are expanded to fill the horizontal space. There will never be more
than "width" columns.

width=0, height > 0: manager has "height" rows, and grows horizontally as
needed. Since buttons don't expand vertically, the buttons will always keep
the buttongeometry specified in the .fvw2rc.

height > 0, width > 0: the manager window is fixed at exactly that size (in
pixels). Buttons will be expanded/shrunk horizonatally as much as needed to
fill the width, but are never expanded vertically.

It won't always be the case that the entire manager window is filled by
buttons. So, in that case, if you are using the shape extension, the window is
cropped to fit the buttons. If you are not using the shape extension, then the
remainder is blank.

The way I think of the managergeometry is that it specifies a constraint on
the maximum number of rows and/or columns. If there is only one constraint,
this gives horizontal or vertical growth. If there are two contraints, then I
could either just cap the number of buttons to width*height, or shrink the
buttons as necessary. The second is obviously the best thing to do, so that's
what it does.

Final note: whether the window grows to the left or right; or up rather than
down depends on the window gravity, which is determined by the sign of the x
and y coordinates given in managergeometry. 

There you go.

You should use the "Recapture" Command after changing the styles.
Then all applications will get the latest style commands. Try

AddToFunc My_function       "I"  Style [$0] BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 1
                            "I"  Recapture

that will work. Also, somewhere in the in the fvwm2 distribution you
will find a file called "decor_examples" which explains many jet
undocumented features of fvwm2. Might be an answer for your first
posting "FVWM: specific button style for each window ?" as well.

bye,
    Lars

What version of FvwmIconMan are we speaking of?

I downloaded the latest (v0.9 and I got the v0.9 docs) and still cannot
get this to work.  The docs explicitly say that only a vertical arrangement
is supported.  I've tried all suggestions and still get a vertical
arrangement (not surprising given the docs).  In fact, it doesn't even
like the managergeometry and buttongeometry resources (a scan of the source
reveals that only "geometry" is recognized).  I figure you should know best!
Sorry if I am asking such stupid questions here, but this has proven to be
very confusing.

  Thanks,

    ...Lance

Never mind--I have found that there is a special FvwmIconMan site and have
found that there have been PLENTY of new versions since 0.9.  I now have
the taskbar up and running.  Thanks!

I have a function called StartMax that I use with pop up menus and
with FvwmButtons to size a window when an application is started.  It
looks like this:

# usage: StartMax <window title> <command line>
AddToFunc StartMax	"I" Exec $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
+			"I" Wait $0
+                       "I" Next [$0] Maximize 100 85

and I call it like this:

*FvwmButtons(2x1) Root - StartMax JimiRoot xterm -T JimiRoot -e su -l root

It works perfectly for everything except Xemacs.  If there is an
Xemacs window on a lower-numbered desktop (ie, if there is an Xemacs
on desk 1 and I start a new one on desk 3), it works like it should.
If there is not an Xemacs window on a lower numbered desktop, it does
not do anything at all -- the window appears like it normally would.

Any ideas?  It's Xemacs 19.15

Hi,

I'm looking for a low effort way to get fvwm 1.24 up on my
solaris 2.5 box.

Where might I find a binary fvwm?

Thanks for a great window manager to those who have worked so hard.

This is a really minor point but it is bugging me.  When fvwm and modules draw 
3D things it calculates the bevel colours based on the background and so do 
Motif programs.  The algorithm that fvwm uses is different to the Motif one. 
This results in an FvwmButtons that looks a bit odd if a Motif program is 
swallowed.  I don't know what the two algorithms are but I think I prefer the 
Motif one.  I can make the Motif programs use Fvwm shadowcolors with Xdefaults 
but I don't know what the fvwm colours will be.  Is there an easy way of taking 
the fvwm background colour and converting it to a *topShadow and *bottomShadow 
setting.  I would like to do this in the fvwm InitFunction if possible.

Cheers,
Tim.

I use one called mini.resize.xpm.  Forget where I got it, but it's in
a personal directory here at work with X11R6 in it's pathname.  If you
don't have it, here it is (I have a bunch called mini.xxx).

It's 14x14 but it should do for what you want.

Put a line like this in your .fvwmrc file:

*FvwmPagerFont none

and the label will disappear.

My .fvwm2rc contains the lines:

PixmapPath /home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps:/home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps/Icons/reduced:/home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps/Buttons

As this line is long and wraps off the screen, I tried to split it across lines like this:

PixmapPath \
	/home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps: \
	/home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps/Icons/reduced: \
	/home/bjs/Documents/Video/Pictures/Pixmaps/Buttons

But my pixmaps were no longer found!  So did I do something wrong, or is this in fact something missing from Fvwm?  If it is missing, I think it would be a really great thing to implement.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I just downloaded and compiled (with only a few problems) fvwm-2.0.45
under Solaris 2.5.1 on a SPARC.  I installed in under
/third/fvwm-2.0.45/

A friend had downloaded the xpm bitmaps, so I copied his and put them into
a directory called fred in the fvwm directory.

I copied the system.fvwm2rc-sample-1 to my home directory and modified
just three lines:

ModulePath /third/fvwm-2.0.45/modules
PixmapPath /third/fvwm-2.0.45/fred/xpm3icons/
IconPath   /third/fvwm-2.0.45/fred/xpm3icons/

In my error logfile, I see:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /third/fvwm-2.0.45/modules/FvwmButtons
Permission denied
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /third/fvwm-2.0.45/modules/FvwmPager
Permission denied

The first error message is, I think, caused by the automatic loading of
the FvwmButtons modules by the following line of the .fvwm2rc:

AddToFunc InitFunction 	  "I" Module FvwmButtons
+			  "I" exec xsetroot -mod 2 2 -fg \#554055 -bg \#705070

The second was caused by me using the modules submenu under the utilities
menu to try to bring up the Pager.

I looked through the FAQ (nothing) the man page (nothing) and searched the
mail archives.  There, I got a dozen hits, but they were all the same:

> very old parsing bug.
> consistent use of GetNextToken or some such should root this out.

> (it's a string consisting of just a tab or space which is thought to be a
> command or module. Execution has to fail.)

There was another, even older, that talked about the syntax of the menu
definition being wrong, but, since I'm using the sample .fvwm2rc, I don't
think that would be the error.

The permissions on all the files and directories under /third/fvwm-2.0.45
is rwxr-xr-x.

I can't think of anything else to try.  Can someone help?  I'd really like
to have a Pager.

Thanks,

Scott

I just upgraded from fvwm 1.stable to 2.0.45 in order to get more
sensible behavior for large sized buttons in the button bar (a 2-column
goodstuff with a 2x2 xclock as the first thing would append, rather than
inserting space in front of, the displaced buttons).  However, it would
seem that I've lost something in the way of multiple IconBoxes (the
invisible zones of icon attraction, not the module).

What I really want, is a two or three column IconBox just to the left of
my button bar (which is in the upper right hand corner) which would
exhibit what was called (back in the days before fvwm) as a northeast
gravity, preferably filling the rightmost column before beginning to
creep left.  I got this out of fvwm1 by creating one icon box as the
column I wanted filled, then a second for the next column, and a third
for the third column.  But with fvwm2 I see only the last IconBox style
taking effect.  I tried swapping the left and right X coordinates of the
IconBox, but that only made no icons go into the box at all (no error
message, either).

Suggestions?  Besides downgrading?

First I will appologize for asking a question not directly related to
fvwm. Sorry.

I'am hoping someone can help me with a problem concerning Xlib
programming, or at least direct me to someone that can.

The problem:

	XSelectEvents can be used so that mulitiple clients can select the
	same events on the same window, but it has several restrictions.
	The restriction that is currently giving me an itch is the one
	that says, "Only one client at a time can select a ButtonPress
	event."  For the program I am trying to write I need another
	client to be able to intercept the events related to a disjoint
	client, without having to change the code of the client I am
	trying to intercept events from.

	Can anyone tell me if there is a way around this ButtonPress
	block.


	Thanks,
	Billy Mullins

It seems that the man page is not correct in this point. As far as I can
see the existing code deals with icons only. In the README it says that 
side option is just a hack which will be replaced by a more general solution.
For the time being the attached patch might be useful. It will reserve space
for the title up to half of the width of the button.

Hi all

I'm swallowing a pager and asclock in a fvwm buttons module.  The button
module is configured to the right side vertical screen position.  

When I start fvwm, the pager and asclock windows appear briefly in the
upper left side of the screen.  When the button module makes its
appearance, the pager and asclock windows disappear from the upper left
and take their place in the button bar.  These modules are being called
from the buttons configuration section of .fvwm2rc only - they are not
being called from init or any other section as far as I can tell.

Is there a method I can use to stop the temporary appearance of the
asclock and pager in the upper left?

Thanks.

Try specifying a position that's offscreen (eg. "-geom +4000+0") for the
swallowed windows.

Hope this helps,
