There have been several examples in the past.  Search the mailing
list for them and use the old tarball they appeared in.  Please
don't waste my time generating artificial buggy situations for
you.

I don't.  Sometimes it's better to live without certain "features"

It's a gkrellm problem.  Period.  Not every bug in applications

Well, good job in writing that mail.  Although it was long, it was

This can already be approximated with

  DestroyFunc ScreenDump
  AddToFunc ScreenDump
  + I schedule 0 0 exec xwd

  key f12 a m ScreenDump

Hi,

I have another question concerning the current Wiki setup (sorry that I 
don't use the dedicated IRC channel - but it is really impractical for me): 
What is the "Scripts" section for? I put in some information on how to 
integrate the menus from CodeWeavers apps and the SuSE menus because 
someone already predefined a "Creating Menus" section. Now, I'm not so sure 
anymore that this is the correct place - maybe stuff like this belongs in 
the "Tips and Solutions" section. So, could someone please clarify what the 
"Scripts" section is for by documenting it in the Wiki?

Another related thing: In CreatingNewPages it says that the WikiNames for 
new subsections should be e.g. Tips/CenterWindow instead of CenterWindow. 
Doesn't this cause inconsistencies when rearranging sections as there seems 
to be no action in the Wiki for renaming pages?

Felix

The only example I found is the well known "rxvt selection problem"
and ... it happens on "H"old. We are not agree on a problem it seems
to me that you can make an effort and give me an example (as I said I
worked hard on this, this last few days). Or should claim that there
is no to see one?

There is no reason for a function of the form

AddToFunc I FvwmEventHandle_config_window Echo "config_window"

to be aborted because the pointer is grabbed. Again a complex func can
do so many things that controling the grabbing is necessary IMO.

Yes it is a gkrellm problem (and maybe a gtk 2.2 problem). The problem
I've with my "old" gkrellm come from FvwmEvent. What about the others
examples I give with FvwmEvent?

My feeling is that you do not want to do something (on this subject)
whatever the problems we can discover with the current code, whatever
I can or any body else can say and whatever the solution we can propose
(an optional pre cmd) ...etc.  So yes it is easy to answer my mails.

the Scripts section is for scripts that dynamically "configure" FVWM.
yours generates a SuSE menu and is right in the Scripts section. Tips

we thought about this. and this is why our subpages structure is not
very deep. the subpages hirachy is independent from the hirachy on the
frontpage. Tips/CenterWindow is a tip, and always will be a tip, and so
it will stay in Tips/ ... we use this because a list of children of a
page can automatically be generated (at the moment this is only a test).

But i have alwsy to refer to it as Tips/CenterWindow or need i just to
use CenterWindow? Maybe in the future there will be a lot of tips/* and
i don't really want to see them all on every tips-page. And then again
somebody will have to rename them on your machine to cut the piece
section in smaller, well defined pieces... I don't really got the
advantage of this whole subpage thing?!

Here is the advantage. Does CenterWindow page describe an fvwm command
(there were thoughts to add it), your new shell script, your config
snippet or some application? This can't be guessed from the name, so
such page name seems to be bad. Tips/CenterWindow name is intuitive.
Use ["Tips/CenterWindow"] syntax in your other pages to refer to it.

Think also about pages like Instalation/GNOME (compile time headers),
Integration/GNOME (run time), Scripts/GNOMEMenus (with user script
creating such menus attached), Tips/GNOMEMenus (using FvwmGtk or other
distributed modules or scripts). Any such name conflicts should be
reduced from the start.

I don't think this mailing list is good for discussing every small detail
of Wiki, Probably using irc or Wiki itself to leave your ideas, comments,
or questions is more appropriate.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I already explained the problem with Enter- and LeaveNotify events
and SloppyFocus.  You don't even need an external application to
get problems with scripts that warp the pointer and change the
focus.  There have been several patches in the past with a fix
following soon.

Predicting whether the grab is necessary or not is impossible.
This may depend on the output of external commands, other complex
functions, the behaviour of other applications, and so on.

I repeat, I'm talking only about the complex function grab.  We
must either live with the problems that come from it or find a
different way to get around them.

Yes, I hope I made it clear that I consider getting rid of the
grab is the wrong way to go.  Other than that I hope we can do
without further sarcasm, finger pointing, flaming, etc.

OK, this makes sense.

Hi, gkrellm does not do any pointer or keyboard grabs, so I'm really
not sure what the issue is here or how it could be a gkrellm bug.

Gkrellm connects to button press events and when the button is pressed
in the hostname area gkrellm then does window moves while it gets
mouse motion events (as long as the motion event state indicates the button
is still pressed or until it gets a button released event).  The moves are
done using gdk_window_move() (which calls XMoveWindow()), again without
grabbing anything.

I'm not sure what action GTK2 might be taking, but I've had no reports of
any behavior like this with any other window managers.

I am running 2.5.7 with fvwm-themes 0.62:  I have a personal them.
with startup, modules, menus,menu-programs,menu-extra, and bindings.

I monkied around with menus quite a bit.... AND didn't do much rtfm'n
before recklessly doing this, but it's working. 

Thanks,

Mojo

my config file for my pager is as follows:

Sorry, I forgot to describe the problem.  If I cause a menu to go over the
pager, it doesn't refresh the pager. so then it is no longer
transparent.  


Thanks,

Mojo

Hi,

Is it possible (in fvwm 2.5.7) to display/deiconify a iconified
window on the current page, rather than moving to the page where the
iconified window used to be (to see the deiconified window)?

If this could be set per window name/resource, that would be swell.

Here is one idea[0]...

  - make the iconified window sticky
  - deiconify
  - make it unsticky

  [0] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=vaf4t2bm75x.fsf%40ramses.ls6.uni-do


...WRT above plan, would making a iconified sticky happen first, if
at all, before deiconification?

I suppose, window could me styled w/ 'SkipMapping' before
deiconification; turned off after being unsticky...

  - make the iconified window sticky
  - apply SkipMapping style
  - deiconify
  - make it unsticky
  - apply !SkipMapping style


...what do you think?

StickyIcon should do exactly what you want:

Hi!

Just wondering if someone has already resized the FVWM-banner pixmap
banner.fvwm_blue_cursive.xpm found in:

        http://www.fvwm.org/generated/icon_download/fvwm_icons.tgz

so that it fits nicely as the StartIcon in FvwmTaskBar?

Hi,

I have configured fvwm with "SloppyFocus" focus policy and without any
automatical raising of windows.

Beginning with OpenOffice 1.1x, Openoffice/StarOffice for some reason
always raises it's window as soon as a window receives the focus. In
other similar cases, I was able to get the behavior I want with setting
the option "IgnoreRestack".

Unfortunately, on OpenOffice this does not seem to have any effect (all
the other style options do work, so it is not a matter of mistyping the
window class or something like this ...)

Any ideas?

Regards,
                    Peter Daum

In a similar manner to a recent message, I to get a corrupted screen when
moving/minimizing windows in FVWM

I'm using version 2.5.4, running on Solaris 9, and am accessing the system
via a SunRay terminal (rather than plugging straight into the Unix box).

Any ideas?

Steve

Under X, the pointer is grabbed automatically when a button is
pressed.  Otherwise you could not be sure to ever receive the
matching button release event (in case the pointer moved into a
different window).  Even if the application does not do anything
bad itself, it's not a good thing to do to move a window since the
grab is relatively long lived - with the potential to freeze other
applications or the window manager.

The best way to handle this is to use the _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE
client message from the EWMH spec (if it is available).  This
message instructs the window manager to move or resize the window
itself.  The application does not need a pointer grab anymore (or
can call XAllowEvents to release the existing automatic grab).
I have no idea how you do this with GTK2.

This is a very window manager specific problem.  I guess almost
all window managers grab the pointer at some time.  But it is hard
to say when this happens.  The race condition between gkrellm and
fvwm is especially bad because it comes from hard wired
functionality, not random user interaction.

For the archives:

  AddToFunc deiconify_on_current_page
  + I movetopage
  + I iconify off

But in this specific case:

  Style <window name> StickyIcon

Not unless you describe exactly what the problem is and what

When moving, resizing windows, black horizonal/vertical lines appear
within the window (certain sections of the window don't seem to be
refreshing properly). It should be noted that a few X applications
refresh OK.

As I said before. Operations system=Solaris 9, Hardware=Sun SunRay
terminal (standard black box). I start fvwm from the home session of
Solaris CDE e.g.

dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /home/seg/local/bin/fvwm

If I move to another window of my desktop and move back again the screen
refreshes.

Steve

Ah, Solaris again.  As far as I know, it's a bug in the Solaris X

where you can find it.  Can someone else help me out here?

No, neither "IgnoreRestack" nor "EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints"
seems to make any difference :-(

Running with fvwm-2.4.16 on Linux, gtk-gnutella-0.92 consistently starts
up with its titlebar 3/4 of the way off the top edge of the screen.
I've tried Style NoPPosition without any effect.  Clearly some kind of
hinting on gtk-gnutella's part is incorrect; any ideas what I can do to
tell fvwm2 to Do The Right Thing here?


Also, I use Style "*" RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement, ...  in my fvwm2
configuration.  95% of the time, this does what I intend.  However,
fvwm2 refuses to place a window over an icon unless specifically
directed to do so by -geometry.  This frequently results in it placing a
new window over an open window instead, because there isn't room to
place the window NOT covering an existing window without covering icons
instead, and given the choice, it seems to perversely prefer covering
windows to covering icons.  How can I tell fvwm2 that it's OK to place
windows over icons, but not over regular windows?

Your explanations are perfectly clear. I've implemented something new
regarding "_NET" moving window but I do not think that this will fix
the problem you describe. Can you try a "today" snapshot (2003-08-04
has some interesting debug code regarding moving window) and send me (I
do not think the list will be interested) your X "errors" log
generated by your login procedure.

Thanks, Olivier

Maybe someone can suggest GTK developper to use _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE
for gdk_window_move?

When fvwm receives a _NET_ACTIVATE_WINDOW it executes the complex
function EWMHActivateWindowFunc which is defined as:

AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
+ I Iconify off
+ I Focus
+ I Raise

we use a complex function for better user control.  Now if we had
implemented _NET_ACTIVATE_WINDOW by hardcoding the function, something
like: 

  if (IS_ICONFIDED(fw))
  {
	  execute_function_override_window(
	  	NULL, NULL, "Iconify off", 0, fw);
  }
  execute_function_override_window(NULL, NULL, "Focus", 0, fw);
  execute_function_override_window(NULL, NULL, "Raise", 0, fw);

then we never had this problem. I suggest various way to fix this
problem ... I recall one: add a "grab fast and execute" dummy cmd for
complex function:

AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
+ I GrabFastForce
+ I Iconify off
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
  
if one of the immediate action of a complex function is GrabFastForce
(we may found a better name) and if the function has only immediate
action we try to grab the pointer only once (this is important) and we
execute the function even if the grab fail.

Again you do not need to have a recent GTK to reproduce the problem
(I've not). You just need to have a FvwmEvent running which executes
a complex function on raise_window (or configure_window). I explain
too how this GrabFastForce cmd can fix some others natural pbs.

Really, we do not need to begin this discussion all over again.
This is the thread that started it, so it isn't even new in this
context.

I'm trying to set up the following:

When you click a button in the title bar, the window goes into
auto-shade mode. This is like auto-raise, but shade instead. I'm having
trouble figuring out how to set it up. I'm sure it's the same procedure
as setting up auto-raise in the same manner because I'm using FvwmAuto.

Thanks,
Garron

So, you want a window to be shaded when you click on a button?

  #  make the window shaded when title bar button 4 is clicked
  Mouse 0  4  N  WindowShade toggle

  #  window is shaded when title bar is clicked by mouse button 3
  Mouse 3   T  N  WindowShade toggle


...Mind you the raise/focus issue is conveniently ignored.

I don't get it.  You want to use -Auto module /along with/ mouse
click?

I hope I got you right. The following code (using it with
2.5.7) make the third button from the left side turn on/off
auto shade when the window gets focus. If the window leaves
focus it is shaded automatically. if the window gets focus
it is unshaded automatically. You can turn off this
behaviour using the button:

ButtonStyle 6 Vector 5 40x40@2 40x60@2 60x60@2 60x40@2 40x40@2 -- Flat UseTitleStyle
Style * Button 6 
Mouse 1 6 A State 1 toggle

DestroyFunc AutoShadeOn 
AddToFunc AutoShadeOn I WindowId $0 (State 1) WindowShade on

DestroyFunc AutoShadeOff
AddToFunc AutoShadeOff I WindowId $0 (State 1) WindowShade off

Module FvwmAuto 0 -passid "Silent AutoShadeOff" "Silent AutoShadeOn"

Cheers, Uwe

Out of curiosity and for the sake of learning, I tried this code on
fvwm-2.4.16 and it didn't work.  I can get the new button to show up on
either side of the menubar, I can get the vector button to look suitable
for the function (my definition is actually Vector 5 20x20@2 20x30@2
80x30@0 80x20@0 20x20@2 -- Raised), the button depresses when I click
it, but then when I move focus on and off the window, nothing happens. 

I noticed that in fvwm-2.4.16, the argument to WindowShade is apparently
1 or 2, rather than on or off.  I made that change, with no effect.  It
still doesn't work.

The following is precisely what I have in .fvwm2rc:

ButtonStyle 3 Vector 5 20x20@2 20x30@2 80x30@0 80x20@0 20x20@2 -- Raised 
Style * Button 3
Mouse 1 3 A State 1 toggle
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOn
AddToFunc AutoShadeOn I WindowId $0 (State 1) WindowShade 1
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOff
AddToFunc AutoShadeOff I WindowId $0 (State 1) WindowShade 2
Module FvwmAuto 0 -passid "Silent AutoShadeOff" "Silent AutoShadeOn"

Now, I also looked in my .xsession-errors, hoping fvwm2 was logging
something, and behold!

[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'State'


So.  What does State do in fvwm-2.5.7, so that I can figure out how to
get the same functionality in fvwm-2.4.16?  Or is this functionality
simply not available in 2.4.16?

(Before you ask, I haven't updated to 2.5.7 because the FVWM homepage
seems to be saying that 2.4.16 is the stable version and 2.5.x is the
development tree.)

The state command was introduced in version 2.5.1:
   http://www.fvwm.org/news/#2.5.1 
so the code cannot work in a 2.4.x version. 

The state command sets/unsets/toggles one of 31 user states
which may be used to remember certain things such as a
button press.

You may try the following at your box to see the effect:

DestroyFunc AutoShadeOn
AddToFunc AutoShadeOn I WindowId $0 WindowShade True
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOff
AddToFunc AutoShadeOff I WindowId $0 WindowShade False
Module FvwmAuto 0 -passid "Silent AutoShadeOff" "Silent AutoShadeOn"

which should work with 2.4.16. The problem is you cannot
turn the autoshade on/off for certain windows since you
don't have the state command/condition.

According to my experience 2.5.7 is quite stable - I never
had a crash :-) - so you might check it out. The new
features are really worth it.

You are right, this was the simple version. If you want to
use a timeout you should use the schedule/deschedule command
in conjunction with FvwmAuto. I am not that sure about the
code but there was a posting about an auto hide function
which showed the usage of schedule and deschedule. Please
refer to the mail archive:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/ 

or to the new wiki pages which should also contain this
piece of code:

  http://rvb.dyndns.org/FvwmWiki/

I was thrilled to learn that fvwm2 supported transparency and that it
was a piece of cake to setup. So no I have a nice transparent menu.
But when I started playing with FvwmWinList I saw that its transparency
was better. Better in the way that it not only was transparent but that
you could actually see the windows underneath it not only the root
image. How can I fix it so that this goes for other parts of fvwm
menu's, title-bars etc?

Also I would like to give a great thanks to the people making this nice
and extremely flexible window manager - its far the best I have used.

Well, I don't have an answer, but can comment.  I am running Solaris 8 on a Sun
Blade 100 and have seen similar behavior.  I am currently running FVWM 2.4.5
which exhibits this behavior infrequently and only with certain apps.  I can't
even remember which apps at this point.  I had upgraded to 2.5.5 at one point
which exhibited the behavior all the time with apps and popup menus.  I assumed
it was a problem with the Solaris X server since I don't see the same problem on
Linux machines.  I patched the X server (with the latest cluster) and things
got even worse in 2.5.5.

I haven't revisited trying to resolve this.  Since I don't really crave the
features in 2.5.x, I'm ok with 2.4.5 and the artifacts don't appear that often.
Given that you are running Solaris 9 and still seeing the problem leads me to
think there still is no solution!

Hey guys, im trying to convince a friend of mine to switch to fvwm from
sawfish, one of the features he said fvwm would have to have before
switching is "Window Packing".

This is how window packing was explained to me: directing a window to
move in a given direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) until it hits
something; eg a screen edge or another window.

It took me a few hours to work out how to do this, but I think i've
finally got a working function, and imho, it's pretty slick :-) (the
effect that is, my implementation is not very elegant :-) )

I thought id share it, so here goes:

DestroyFunc PackWindowUp
AddToFunc PackWindowUp
+ I SetEnv low_w 0
+ I All (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus \
        !Shaded ) PipeRead "test `expr $[w.y] + $[w.height]` -gt $$low_w \
        -a `expr $[w.y] + $[w.height]` -lt $0 \
        -a \\( \\( $[w.x] -gt $1 -a $[w.x] -lt `expr $1 + $2` \\) \
            -o \\( $1 -gt $[w.x] -a $1 -lt `expr $[w.x] + $[w.width]` \\) \
            -o \\( $1 -lt $[w.x] -a `expr $1 + $2` -gt `expr $[w.x] + $[w.width]` \\) \
            -o \\( $[w.x] -lt $1 -a `expr $[w.x] + $[w.width]` -gt `expr $1 + $2` \\) \
        \\) \

I've only written PackWindowUp/Down here, but its easy to extend it. And it
only includes windows with that accept focus and are not shaded, edit to
preference.

If anyone has any ideas for a more elegant solution, id love to hear it :-)

Actually, the passid options are never really needed in FvwmEvent and
FvwmAuto. Here is the same code, but shorter and clearer:

DestroyFunc AutoShadeOn
AddToFunc   AutoShadeOn I WindowShade True
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOff
AddToFunc   AutoShadeOff I WindowShade False
Module FvwmAuto 0 "Silent AutoShadeOff" "Silent AutoShadeOn"

If you need a condition, you may use ThisWindow instead of "WindowId $0".

Mikhael.

Hello all,

I've searched google, newsgroups, and #fvwm (unfortunately the fvwm
mailing list appears to be unsearchable), but haven't found an answer to
this:

If I have an instance of mozilla running, and then I launch another
instance of mozilla, the new mozilla window does not have my rightmost
titlebar button (which is my Close button).  This happens regardless of
what my rightmost titlebar button is.

If I open a new mozilla window from the first mozilla instance, then all
the titlebar buttons are there.  It's only when I execute the mozilla
binary again does this problem appear.

I'm using FVWM v2.4.6 and Mozilla 1.0.0 on Debian Linux 3.0.

Using DecorateTransient doesn't fix this, and I can't figure out how to do
fix it any other way.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Adam

Hmm.  Interestingly, I received this followup, but not the post of Uwe's
(following up mine) that you were following up to.

I just tried this code, as given, both with and without ThisWindow and
WindowId $0, and it doesn't seem to have the desired result.

With WindowId $0, clicking the new button gives no effect and a logged
error:
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'State'
Then each time focus changes from one window to another, the following
errors are logged:
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'True'
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'False'

With ThisWindow, or with neither ThisWindow nor WindowId $0, the "No
such command 'State'" error still occurs, clicking the new button still
does nothing, and all windows autoshade upon losing focus but never
unshade.

There does not seem to be a 'State' documented anywhere in fvwm-2.4.16.
I can trivially implement a manual per-window WindowShade button, and I
can make all windows automatically Shade, but I don't seem to be able to
make a window automatically unshade, or make a per-window autoshade.  Is
this a 2.4.16 limitation?


Experimenting with this has raised another question.  The following
ButtonStyle creates a raised button with a narrow raised bar across the
top of the button:

ButtonStyle 3 Vector 5 20x20@2 20x30@2 80x30@0 80x20@0 20x20@2 -- Raised

The following ButtonStyle *SHOULD*, unless I'm missing something, create
a button like the above with a capital A drawn in the shadow color below
the bar:

ButtonStyle 6 Vector 13 20x20@2 20x30@2 50x30@0 50x40@1 90x30@2 80x35@2 \
      80x65@2 90x70@2 50x40@2 50x30@1 80x30@0 80x20@0 20x20@2 -- Raised

However, when I load this configuration, this button actually looks the
same as the ButtonStyle 3 button.  Can anyone suggest why this would
happen?

(My intention is for Button 3 to be manual-shade and button 6 to be
 per-window autoshade, at present.  If I ever actually get this
 *working*, I'll probably actually swap the two buttons.)

That's because when mozilla launches a new window it's using the same
engine in memory, so all windows running from within your 'profile' will
be linked together.
It's got to do with the way that mozilla tells the WM about it's
transient windows... there is no real solution to this...
however,

when opening a new window (well sorta) try this:
mozilla -remote 'openWindow($url,new-tab)'

It'll open $url in a new tab within the current mozilla window, and the
tabs have their own close buttons.
I have a script to specifically do this:

have fun!

DOH!  Well, I just figured *this* out.  I used the wrong color for the 
A -- color 2 when I should have been using color 0.  (I also drew the A
on its side, and it look's kinda rough even then.)

I neither can understand how this may happen with the main
(non-transient) browser window nor may reproduce this with my mozilla,
but I think this line should fix it:

  ButtonStyle All - Clear  # remove all default titlebar button hints

Optionally, you may also want to setup correct hints for your buttons
(the default hints are for 2=Maximize, 4=Iconify, not what you have):

  ButtonStyle 1 - MwmDecorMenu
  ButtonStyle 6 - MwmDecorMin
  ButtonStyle 4 - MwmDecorMax

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks Scott.

I'm going to try to use Mozilla Firebird instead, which doesn't have this
problem, and is faster at browsing anyways.  Although instead of just
exec'ing the MozillaFirebird program again you have to do a remote
command, like you mentioned for normal Mozilla.  This is because running
the MozillaFirebird program again will say you can't run it because the
default profile is in use, and makes you pick a different one.  How
annoying.

I use this remote command, which opens up a new blank window:

MozillaFirebird -remote "xfeDoCommand(openBrowser)"

And I use this script to launch Mozilla from an Fvwm menu:  (Credits to
Scott for providing the original script that I modified to suit my needs.
I'd forgotten all about the usefulness of the Shell Perl module!)

#!/usr/bin/perl
use Shell;
my $run = qq{/path/to/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird};
# Is mozilla running?
my $is_running = pidof("MozillaFirebird-bin");
chomp($is_running);
if($is_running){
	# Mozilla is running....
	$run .= qq{ -remote "xfeDoCommand(openBrowser)"};
}
exec("$run&");

I just installed fvwm 2.5.7 and really like it. The only problem
I've had with it so far is that it won't recognise any key bindings where
I use Alt, Shift or Ctrl (for example ALT+Tab). I know that the keys work,
since no other program has any trouble recognising them.

Anyone know a solution to this problem? Appreciate all help :)

If it is of any help I'm usin Mandrake 9.1, without any big changes from
the standard package (yet).

Do you have NumLock pressed? If so, see FAQ #0.1.

Hi Mikhael,

Thanks for the suggestion, although neither of these (alone or together)
fixed the problem.  But Firebird is working wonderfully so far! :)

Hi folks

fvwm 2.5.7

I have:

  Style Galeon		EWMHMiniIconOverride, MiniIcon galeon.png

My mini icon png exists and is fine (and used to be used with
galeon 1.2). Since I went to galeon 1.3.7 it is donating its own
mini icon. fvwm uses this in titlebars, but on attempts to include
this in a menu (actually FvwmWindowMenu) produces the error:

 [FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from ewmh_mini_icon

and no mini icon. I believe my Style line above should fix this, but
it doesn't. Am I using it wrong?

Thanks
Ric

Hello,
Upgrade from FVWM 2.4.6 to 2.5.7 seemed to go OK, but the symbols on 
the buttons on the right side of the title bar vanished.  Looks like 
the meaning of "...@3" and "...@2" in a vector ButtonStyle may have 
been swapped between 2.4.6 and 2.5.7, because when I changed my 
ButtonStyles from ...@3 to ...@2, the button symbols came back, as 
they had been.

I know that 2.5.7 is running, because I now see PNG icons in 
FvwmButtons.  By the same token, I know that my ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc is 
being read, because FvwmButtons comes up with my layout.

Here are the button definitions:

#DMW,07AUG03,Upgrade from 2.4.6 to 2.5.7 caused these to become

Is anyone else having a problem with Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1 where the icon
doesn't appear when the window is minimized?  I figure this is a glitch
with Firebird, so I added the path to where the Firebird icon was on my
system (it ships with Firebird) to my ImagePath, and I added the following
style line:

Style "Mozilla Firebird" Icon mozicon50.xpm

But that didn't work, so I tried:

Style "Mozilla Firebird" IconOverride, Icon mozicon50.xpm

And that didn't work either.

Anyone else seen this or have a fix?

Adam

Note first that galeon 1.2 works with gtk 1 and have no EWMH icons.

Secondly, Indeed, If you use FvwmWindowMenu

	"Style * EWMHMiniIconOverride"

is appropriate for consistency (One day we may "fix" this
miss-feature).

Finally I cannot reproduce your problem here (EWMHMiniIconOverride
works here for my KDE3 and GNOME2 apps, but I've no galeon 1.3.x). I
imagine you check that, but are you sure that "galeon" match your
running galeon? What's happen with "Style * EWMHMiniIconOverride"?

Please always specify the fvwm version. OS and Hardware may help too

I do not see why this does not work. Do you have a msg of the form
"Cannot load mozicon50.xpm" in your X error output? Are you sure that
that "Mozilla Firebird" match your Firebird window (FvwmIdent)?

Can you sent the output of "xprop" on Firebird (open a terminal, type
"xprop > xprop_Firebird", a cross should appear and click on the
Firebird window). If the output is to big send it to me only.

I do not see why this does not work. Can you send the output
of "xprop" on  a Firebird window (type "xprop" > xprop_Firebird
and click with the cross on a Firebird window). If the output is
too big send it to me only.

No this is not possible. This can happen for a few times by chance
that's all (but if you use XDirectFB). What happen if you move the
a window which under the WinList? Maybe you use a Trsanparent colorset
and you forget to set: "Style FvwmWinList ParentalRelativity"?

Really this is not possible. Basically X cannot do that. We may
do that for menus (not tearoff one) in the future that's all.

It actually appears that the Resource name given with FvwmIdent is
"Mozilla".  So I changed my .fvwm2rc to use "Mozilla" instead of "Mozilla
Firebird", but still no luck.

I'm using FVWM 2.4.6 on Debian 3.0.

Here is my output from xprop, which says that the WM_NAME is "Mozilla
Firebird"....

The name is probably changing as it opens.

Try:

All of my java windows are being placed incorrectly. If I place a window
at 0,0 the window is placed at 0,0, not the frame (The title bar and
left border are off the screen). It seems like setting the gravity to
static would fix this problem. Is there a way to do that? Is there
another way to fix this problem? Another related problem is that when a
java window that has been moved resizes itself, it jumps up 1 title bar
height and left 1 border width.

Thanks,
Garron

Hmm, that didn't work either.

And I'm not seeing any errors in my .xession-errors about not being able
to find or create a pixmap...

Hello all,

I have a question regarding the updated FVWM2 package, and behavior of
iconification.

Up until today, I was using FVWM 2.4.9  (package
fvwm2-2.4.9-1mdk.i586.rpm), and had things pretty much working as I liked
them, with my system.fvwm2rc set how I wanted.

I today upgraded to 2.4.14 package fvwm2-2.4.14-1mdk.i586.rpm).

However, when using the EXACT SAME system.fvwm2rc file, when I would
iconify the windows, they would just completely vanish.

I am using FvwmIconMan, and not using any actual icons, just listing them
in the upper left corner of the screen.

I finally figured that this was due to the:
Style *	NoIcon

line in my system.fvwm2rc file.  However, if I eliminate this line, not
only does the window iconify, but what appears to be some sort of default
icon manager ALSO has the window.

Please see:
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/king-v/fvwm/scrshot.gif

As you can see, in the list of 5 windows, the 3rd one is iconified
(indicated by the small square next to the text of the window title).  Note
however that tucked behind the list, you can see trailing along the top
edge, to the right of the list, a titlebar of sorts (with the text
"omcast.net: /home/king_v" visible).

So now if I don't use NoIcon, I have that extra titlebar floating around
when I iconify a window, but if I use NoIcon, not only will that titlebar
be gone, but FvwmIconMan will lose the window from its list as well.

Is there a way around this?  How can I get the behavior that 2.4.9 was
giving me while still using the latest version?

Thanks in advance.

	- Joe Vahabzadeh

Ack, I'm so stupid. I assumed "galeon" was matching the class
because the UseStyle was getting set in the same line. Turns
out I had a rogue wildcard on that style from testing something
else.

Changed it to match the class and it now works.

However, without the EWMHMiniIconOverride, WindowList and
FvwmIconMan get the ewmh icon provided by the app. FvwmWindowMenu
causes fvwm to throw the error above. It seems that the string
"ewmh_mini_icon" is getting sent in M_MINI_ICON for galeon, rather
than the icon name, as in other cases. In this case why does
FvwmIconMan work? Am I using that packet wrong?

Hello,
I just installed Red Hat 5.2.  Logged on to root.  typed xdm, got the log in
screen.  Logged in as root again.  I now can not seem to shut down the
computer.  ctrlaltdel doesn't work.  Shutdown -h  now in the term window
doesn't seem to work, it just goes back to the xwindow log in screen.  Is it
safe to power down at this point?  I have FVWM2  window manager.
Thanks in advance, I have searched all 1020 pages of the SAMS book Red Hat
Linux Unleashed  and 861 pages of QUE's Using Unix.

   shutdown -h now

   man shutdown for more info

   ctrl-alt-del usually works only from text console (not from X 
windows), use ctrl-alt-F1 to get to text console (usually F1 - F6 are 
text consoles, F7 is your X windows session)

   you have better chances for good responses in more general linux

Just a data point ...  I used awt & swing components in some
relatively light (as in class homework) programs and i did not have
any problems wrt resizing.  (I used fvwm 2.5.[56] & jdk 1.3.1p7 or

I think that the behavior you describe is intentional. There are
surely good reasons for that (e.g., keyboard menu navigation is for
expert which want fast navigation?).

I do not think that there is a workaround ... maybe in the future
a config option.

Yes and no. It seems to me that it is difficult to implement something
like PageOnly with the fvwm to module communication that we have now.
One problem is that a page can be any where on the desktop so
redrawing should be done window by window (technically, at each
CONFIGURE_WINDOW packet). The result is a semi-random order (maybe
fixable) and a lot of redrawing.

I suggest to do not use the PageOnly option. What about DeskOnly
and a relayout of your Pages/Desks ...

Maybe we should warn the users in the man page.  Dominik any comments?
I think it is you that has introduced PageOnly?

Apriori it is not. Can you send your config. I see a lot of redrawing
in some case with PageOnly (for the reason I just explained) but when
switching between page with a lot of windows (and this does not take 2
secs). But, maybe you have a very slow machine and/or X?

Is this happen sometimes or systematically? Can you give a procedure
to reproduce this problem? Configuration files, how you start fvwm
(e.g., do you start it via gnome-session?) running (gnome) apps ...etc.

Thank you, Olivier.  I'll make a note to switch my definitions back, 
next time I install an upgrade.

By the way, I have a log entry claiming that I sent a post to this 
group requesting help with FvwmTabs saying that X11::Protocol wasn't 
installed, even though I'd installed it as per the FvwmTabs site's 
instructions.  I cannot actually find such a post.  On the other 
hand, if anyone saw such a post, please don't worry about it anymore.  
I have found the problem.  It seems that "make install" set the 
permission bits of all of the subdirectories that it created to 750, 
so it was invisible to me.

Thanks-
Douglas

Hello,
I just got FvwmTabs 2.0 working with FVWM 2.5.7.  Very nice!

I am seeing one problem, though.  I currently use KMail 1.5 (from KDE 
3.1-10) for email.  I am not running a full KDE desktop.  When KMail 
is running under FVWM, but not under FvwmTabs, I can use 
drag-and-drop to move emails from Inbox to a folder.  If I swallow 
KMail into FvwmTabs, then drag-and-drop no longer works.  I always 
see the "not allowed here" (circle-with-a-line-through-it) cursor.  
Usually, nothing happens when I try to drop the file.  Once, FvwmTabs 
and all swallowed applications just disappeared.  In that instance, I 
could not restart FvwmTabs nor KMail, but I didn't recognize any 
leftover processes in "ps -A" (but that could just mean I didn't know 
what I was looking for).  I have not been able to reproduce the 
abend.  I do not know whether drag-and-drop works in any other 
applications inside of FvwmTabs or not, because KMail is the only 
application where I use drag-and-drop.

Should this drag-and-drop work?  If so, is there any other debugging 
info needed?

Minor issue:  on the FvwmTabs dropdown menu, the About selection does 
nothing on my system.

I have:
KDE 3.1-10 (Red Hat)
KMail 1.5
fvwm 2.5.7-1 (installed RPM from fvwm.org)
FvwmTabs,v 2.0 2003/07/24 09:12:18 scott Exp
the default fvwmtabrc
X11-Protocol-0.51 from the FvwmTabs link
perl-tk-800.024-27782cl
perl-5.8.0-88
XFree86-4.3.0-2
Red Hat Linux 9.0

Thanks very much-
Douglas

Is it possible to bind a Panel becoming visible/retracting to a keystroke=
 ?

Basically I have created a Panel that swallows licq ...

*licq-holder: (Panel(indicator, smooth, down, \
        position module center mtb) "Licq (Schattenj=E4ger)" \
       'Exec exec licq')

Would be easier to have a keyboard shortcut to retract/contract the panel
than having to move my mouse and click.

Because FvwmIconMan (as the TaskBar and WinList) use the pixmap ids
(picture, mask, alpha, width, height and depth members of the
M_MINI_ICON packet) and not the name. For Fixing FvwmWindowMenu we
should add a new fvwm menu syntax to be able to pass an ewmh_mini_icon
(e.g., %ewmi(window_id)%), but I do not think that it is the time to
do that.

To avoid the error we may always send the name from the MiniIcon style
as I do not think that ewmh_mini_icon is used. However, sometimes
error is better: in this case the error "says" that you should use
"Style * EWMHMiniIconOverride" to get the same mini-icon everywhere.

Hi,

I just switched from 2.4.16 to 2.5.7 and my xrootconsole started to
behave badly. In 2.4.16 it put itself in the background (I mean it never
covered any windows) and let the mouseclicks pass through, i.e. I got my
fvwm menus popping up when I clicked on it. Now it just covers visible
windows and does not ignore the clicks.
Has anybody come across this?

Thanks,
Piotr Zgorecki

That isn't possible yet. I'm also interested in this feature, and was
planning to implement it one day if nobody else had yet, but i didn't have 
any time so far.

I think the following will do what you want, but you will need to

With 2.5.7 you may try to add FixedPPosition.

I suggest you upgrade to 2.5.7 and use the following styles:

MinOverlapPlacement or MinOverlapPercentPlacement

then you can use the

MinOverlapPlacementPenalties or  MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties 

styles to control various convering factor (e.g., ignore icons).

All you can do is is to write a function using WarpToWindow to

Do you run fvwm under session manager (xsm or gnome-session)?

Sometimes shutdown crashes (I don't know why) and leaves a
'hard-to-kill' process in memory. While this process is running, you
can't re-execute shutdown. kill -anything doesn't affect the process,
but eventually it dies, allowing you to successfully re-execute
shutdown. 

If there is no shutdown process running, try logging in as root from the
console(ie not in X or fvwm) and execute shutdown from there.

Hi Olivier, I find it difficult to agree with you. Here we have one
command - menu - called with the same options, executed in two
different ways, producing two distinctly different results. This isn't
always grounds for crying 'bug', but in this case 'menu' (or 'popup')
should (IMHO) produce the same result, in the way I have used it above.
I can't see any logical or practical reason why the results should
differ. . .

With the keyboard, I want to select the first menu entry with as
few keystrokes as possible, i.e. <open menu>, <enter>.  If the
pointer were over the title, I'd have to press <down> to get the
pointer over the first item.

It would make very little sense to have the pointer over the first
item if the menu was opened with the mouse because menus often
have a double click action defined.

Hi,
I think, this is a well known problem - but I haven't been successful
solving it ... :-(

If I "Exec exec xfe" (a file manager) started from a click to a
FvwmTaskBar menu then it consitantly shows up at the upper left
corner of my screen (0,0) and so covers my task bar (at top of the
screen).

How can I change this? The window should appear a bit more down at about
(0,31) like the other windows. I use the following settings:


Style * NoPPosition
EWMHBaseStruts 0 0 31 0

DestroyMenu menu_filemanager
AddToMenu menu_filemanager
+ "X File Manager" Exec exec xfe

Thanks for any help!
 Felix

I start my FVWM2 under gnome-session via ~/.gnome/session:

------------ ~/.gnome/session ------------------

when I choose ``SaveSession&Quit'' the session closes, but it doesn't

Aha, this is beginning to make sense. However, where does this leave me,
who routinely uses a shortcut to bring up a menu, and then uses the
mouse to select the menu option? I can't use the mouse all the time to
bring my menu, as it is bound to copy and paste in most of my windows.

Why this is such an issue for me is that my first menu item is a
sub-menu. When I use my shortcut to bring up the menu, the mouse-pointer
is positioned on the first menu item and my sub-menu then opens, which
is very annoying. I could put the sub-menu somewhere else, but this
would not be satisfying at all.

Hi all.

I've recently compiled fvwm-2.5.7. I've copied some lines of
a .fvwm2rc file posted here a month ago like

# MenuStyle Colorsets
Colorset 11 fg #0E1010, hi #FFFFFF, fgsh White, Transparent, Tint white 80
MenuStyle * MenuColorset 11

but it didn't work. What I'm doing wrong? Is there any doc to
easy configure menu transparency?

Another question is that I couldn't find FvwmConsole command after
compilation. Should I add some argument to ./configure to make
FvwmConsole?

thanks and sorry for my english

Ok, thanks for the info!

Sort of wandering off-topic.... but thus far the reason I was using 2.4.14
was because that was the latest Mandrake i586 rpm version I could find
(yes, I know, I'm very lazy when it comes to dealing with installing
software!).

Does anyone know if installing the Red-Hat 2.4.16, which is an i386
compile, or if using the Mandrake Cooker 2.4.16, is safe?  I've never quite
understood what the difference between a Mandrake and a Mandrake Cooker
version of software is.

Thanks in advance...

I haven't tried redhat or cooker so I can't be certain.

Cooker is where Mandrake has its untested software.

I'd guess you will be OK with cooker if it doesn't complain about
being dependent on shared libraries you don't have.

Did you investigate the PopupDelay, and other assorted options, then?
>From fvwm(1)...

  PopupDelay requires one numeric argument.   This  value  is  the
  delay  in milliseconds  before a sub-menu is popped up when the
  pointer moves over a menu item that  has  a  sub-menu.   If  the
  value  is  zero no automatic pop up is done.  If the argument is
  omitted the built-in default is used. Note that the popup  delay has
  no effect if the PopupImmediately option is used since sub-menus pop
  up immediately then.


...usage is something like..

  MenuStyle  *  PopupDelay 250

Hello

i've a problem with my Iconify-Functions:
I open a window (Mozilla Mail exactily). The following Line in my 
.fvwm2rc file should move the icon on the right site of the screen:

Style Mozilla           IconBox -1 415 -1 880
Style *Mozilla*         IconBox -1 415 -1 880

This works properly for every Brows-window. But for the mailer it 
doesn't work.
After a restart of the fvwm2 the mailer also works fine.

Anyone have help for me?

Regards, Thom

Hi all

I'm setting up the background of my desktop with te following line

*FvwmBacker: Command Exec xview -onroot -center -border black \
                                -zoom 150 myimage.jpg

and using

aterm -tr +sb -sh 30

it looks nice. The problem is that when I move the aterm window,
it flashes after release the mouse button, showing the background
image without shadowing. Is there any way to avoid these flickering?
Should I change the background configuration?

thanks and sorry for my english

PD: using fvwm-2.4.6 or fvwm-2.5.7

Setup:  fvwm 2.4.16, fvwm-themes 0.6.2 on Solaris 8, dual-head non-Xinerama.

Since upgrading from 2.4.7, and with no substantial changes to my config (other than converting deprecated single-letter variables to their longer counterparts), I am seeing two intermittent startup problems.

1)  Error messages of the form:
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 7, Error 8, EventType: 20
or
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 7, Error 8, EventType: 12
or
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
    [FVWM.0][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 56, Error 7, EventType: 12
or
    [FVWM.1][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
    [FVWM.1][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 56, Error 7, EventType: 2

Whatever causes these errors appears to be self-healing:  when I get one of these, the desktop usually comes up normally anyway.  What do these errors signify?

2)  Failure to execute the StartFunction and InitFunction on *one* of the displays.  Fvwm2 and FvwmTheme are running, my Key and Mouse bindings are all fine, but none of the Modules started in StartFunction are running, nor is the process I "Exec" in InitFunction.  Happens on about one-in-ten logins.  Ctrl-Alt-Escape doesn't help; restarting is required.  (On the opposite display, everything is fine.)  Any help is appreciated.

Ugh . . no luck with Cooker . . oddly it complained about dependencies on
Perl . . but Perl's installed in my system.

But rather than saying it required Perl-(version) . . it gave a dozen or so
messages abut requiring Perl(function-name).

I'll dump the text out to a file and give details.

The Red Hat version gave me trouble as well, though in that case just with
version numbers of one or two shared-libraries that I have to double-check.

I guess for the time being I wait with the problem until someone cooks up
an RPM for the normal Mandrake.  I suppose I should just use the tarball .
. but I'm stubborn!  :)

An XReparentWindow() call caused a BadMatch error.  The error was
delivered with a MapRequest event.  That probably means that fvwm
tried to decorate a window but the window died before it could
do so.  You can ignore it or try to identify the faulty window by
reducing your config until it goes away.

The same as above, except that the error occured with an Expose
event.

XChangeGC() was called with an invalid font.  Please check which
of your font specs causes the error and strip down your config
file for us to reproduce the problem.  Olivieer may need
additional information like the compiled in font related libs and
their version numbers.

Dito.

You can look up these X error codes in fvwm/doc/error_codes.

Experimenting has given more info on this second problem:

a)  The problem is much more likely to occur when the CPU and disk are
under load.  Under heavy load, it happens *every* login.
b)  When the problem occurs, it's always on the fvwm instance that is
started first (I start each instance separately with -s and -d).
c)  No one Module is the culprit.
d)  Running fvwm with -debug doesn't help, and doesn't reveal any
errors.
e)  When the problem occurs, I always get at least one beep (but no
error).
f)  The problem *never* occurs if I delay the start of the second
instance (either with a short sleep, or wait until one of the first
instance's Modules [in StartFunction] has a PID).  This suggests the
possibility that there is a concurrence problem, like both instances
trying to read/write the same /tmp file, etc.

Does this new info help?

Hello,

I try to setup an IconBox on top of the screen with autohide feature using
module FvwmAuto. It works fine, but is it possible to wait and possibly
do nothing if the mouse don't stay enough on top of screen, rather than
immediatly raise IconBox ? 
(something like EdgeResistance but with FvwmAuto?) 

$ fvwm2 -V
fvwm 2.5.7 compiled on Aug  4 2003 at 19:38:39
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Xinerama, XRender,

Below a complete .fvwm2rc file corresponding to what I want to do.

thanks in advance,
Roland.

I think you could use 'fvwm-root --retain-pixmap myimage.jpg' to rid
yourself of the flickering. Also you could try Esetroot.

In the FvwmConsole man page it says:
       FvwmConsole  can  only  be invoked by fvwm.  Command line invocation of
       the FvwmConsole module will not work.

The easiest way to start FvwmConsole is by adding a menu entry.
something like:

AddToMenu RootMenu
+ "Fvwm&Console%$[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/mini_term.png%"  Module FvwmConsole

Hi together,

Last weekend I stucked a little bit writing a  function  for
the  taskbar which switches to a window if it is not visible
(or not on the current page) and which iconifies the  window
if it is on top on the current page (e.g. fully visible). 

I tried:

DestroyFunc TaskBarButton1
AddToFunc TaskBarButton1 I ThisWindow (!Visible) Function DeiconifyUnshadeFlipFocus
 + I ThisWindow (Visible) Iconify on

DestroyFunc DeiconifyUnshadeFlipFocus
AddToFunc DeiconifyUnshadeFlipFocus I Iconify off
 + I WindowShade off
 + I FlipFocus
 + I Raise

Assigning TaskBarButton1 to the taskbar button and pressing
it brings up the window iconifies it immediately.

I thought I might use UserStates to make it work but this
seemed to much for this simple requierment.

Any hints? Thanks in advance.

Regards, Uwe

>From fvwm-themes:

  *FvwmIconMan: action  Mouse 1 A sendcommand FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I DestroyFunc RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I AddToFunc   RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I ThisWindow ( Iconic)         + I Iconify off

  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic  Raised) + I Iconify on
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic !Raised) + I Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic !Raised) + I Raise
  + I RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise

This works for 2.4; in 2.5 there is a real if-else syntax, so it would be
shorter:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I ThisWindow (Iconic) Iconify off
  + I TestRc (NoMatch) ThisWindow (Raised) Iconify on
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Raise

Mikhael.

Quite tricky ;-) Using "Cond" instead of "TestRc" on 2.5.7
works as I hoped.

Thank you.

Dear All,

Just thought I'd send you in a picture of my screenshot (attached with
this e-mail)....

-----description-----

This screenshot shows FVWM running with a modified fvwm-themes (mostly
stolen from 'default'). I have tried to emulate the look and feel of RH's
"AnotherLevel", by changing the window colour, and centering the title of
the windows.

The icons and the panel that you can see are a customised version of
Rox-Filer (http://rox.sf.net) that complements FVWM extremely well.

My desktop has literally thousands of colors. Which one do you refer to?

If you speak about the root background, see FAQ 6.6. After finding a good
background color or image and setting it from the command line, you may
add it to InitFunction in your .fvwm2rc or to ~/.xinitrc file or similar
to make it persistent. Of course if you refer to some other color(s), be
more verbose in your question.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
is there really no way (besides those, see below) to make my app not
appear at (0,0) covering my taskbar?

I use fvwm-2.5.7:

Style * NoPPosition
EWMHBaseStruts 0 0 31 0


To start the app I use:

DestroyMenu menu_filemanager
AddToMenu menu_filemanager
+ "X File Manager" Exec exec xfe

Thanks for any help!
 Felix

Can anybody tell me if there are fvwm-menu-directory online somewhere? 
I love this feature but even with the manpage I have some questions... 
Mainly about --icon-file and to have a directory menu as top level 
menu. TIA!

Sure, maybe it's better if I mention concretely what I want. I have a 
menu that works like this:

My first question is how to add directory entries at toplevel of the 
menu. With this setup:

  Key Super_L A A Popup menu_root Root 8 1

  AddToFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory$
  + I PipeRead "fvwm-menu-directory \\$
    --title '' \\$
    --icon-dir /home/blah/data/fvwm/resource/folder-menu.xpm \\$
    --exec-app '^exec' \\$
    -d '$0'"

  AddToMenu menu_root MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory$
  + "menu"  Popup /home/blah/data/fvwm/testmenu

I get a submenu in my menu with the contents of the testmenu directory.
But I want the contents of the testmenu directory to be in the menu, 
not in a submenu.

Another question: how can I prevent my submenus from having a title? 
The best I came up with is --title '' which is kind of ugly.

The last question is about icons. This is from the manpage:

--icon-title icon menu title icon, default is no
--icon-dir icon menu dir icon, default is no
--icon-file icon menu file icon, default is no
--icon-app icon menu application icon, default is no
--wm-icons define icon names suitable for use with wm-icons package.
  Currently this is equivalent to: --icon-title menu/folder-open.xpm
  --icon-item menu/file.xpm --icon-dir menu/folder.xpm --icon-app
  menu/utility.xpm.

--wm-icons looks nice but I'm not sure what it does... The way I 
interpret is, I should be able to do this: there is a shortcut to gvim 
in my menu-dir. Now, if I put a file gvim.xpm in the menu-dir, it 
should appear as an icon before the gvim entry. Alas, it doesn't, the 
xpm appears as a file. How do the icons work?

TIA!

The way fvwm-menu-directory works is: one invocation builds one menu for
one directory. By default this menu is destroyed when you pop down the
menu. This way you always get the up-to-date listing in the menu and not
the one that is several months old (assuming you run fvwm for this long).

The title is always added. Are you sure you really don't want any title,
how would you distinguish between different listings then? You may use
some desciptive title: --title "My important files".

If you really don't like the title, do this:

  AddToFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  + I PipeRead `fvwm-menu-directory -d '$0' | grep -v '$0" ' | grep -v Nop`

Nope, --wm-icons was not designed to work like this, you are not supposed
to put any icons anywhere, it just assumes that you have wm-icons package
installed. With this options the installed icons will be automatically
used and the actual icon theme seen in menus is configurable by wm-icons.
You just need "ImagePath $HOME/.wm-icons:/usr/local/share/icons/wm-icons:+",
like explained in the wm-icons.sf.net documentation.

Apart of the usage of the word "no" instead of "nope", I think the man
page explains that you may assign 4 icons for different file types. Your
approach to handle some files differently by using them as icons of the
previous file seems very strange to me. Especially when we speak about
random directories (like /tmp or $HOME/.fvwm) and the file order is
configurable. I am not against such features, but this one is not well
defined. Please also keep in mind that this script does not currently
manages icons itself, it is fvwm that searches the icons in ImagePath.

If I understand correctly, you want to prepare the application hierarhies
to be used in menus. This is what another script fvwm-menu-desktop was
designed for, so try it. You should prepare .desktop files similarly to
GNOME and KDE that define the icon and the name for every application.
fvwm-menu-directory is more for arbitrary (non prepared) directories.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Using
FVWM version 2.4.16

Could someone please send a brief example of how to add buttons to the 
Title bar of windows?  Currently I am only able to get the buttons for 
Iconifying, Maximizing, and popping up the control menu.  I've attempted 
playing around with the AddButtonStyle/ButtonStyle commands, but to no 
avail. Nothing I do seems to change the title bar buttons.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Howard

I use fvwm-themes from cvs. It is not quite a single fvwm2rc file, but a
framework. Since you already use unstable software (you have png
support), you may try these snapshots (including src, rpm and deb):

Hi,

something else:

I'm a member of the FFII and we are organizing a demonstration on
August 27th (see the latest press release at http://swpat.ffii.org/
neues/03/demo0819/index.en.html) to make people and MEPs (members of the
European parliament) aware of the dangers surrounding the legalization
of software patents that may be up for vote in the European Parliament
as early as September 1st. The main part of the demonstration will take
place in Brussels. In addition there will be an "online demonstration"
whose idea is to simulate the effects of Software Patents by shutting
down web sites on August 27th (http://swpat.ffii.org/gruppe/demo/
index.de.html).

Is there any chance that the FVWM project participates in this event?
Note that the FVWM web site doesn't need to be closed down completely.
On http://swpat.ffii.org/gruppe/demo/index.de.html there are several
examples on how it's possible to show ones concerns without taking such
drastic measures, but there's no need to stick to the examples.

Just as a quick reminder: Many trivial things are already patented in
the US such as tabbed palettes (http://swpat.ffii.org/patente/
wirkungen/palette/index.en.html) which e.g. FVWMTabs is infringing upon.
I for one don't want to have the same situation in Europe and fear that
it will ultimately kill the competitiveness of Free Software. So this
protest is likely to be our last chance to somewhat influence the
decision making process.

Felix

Howard,

This example works on 2.4.16; it's copied directly from my running
.fvwm2rc:

# Manual windowshade toggle button
ButtonStyle 6 Vector 5 20x20@2 20x30@2 80x30@0 80x20@0 20x20@2 -- Raised
Style * Button 6
Mouse 1 6 A ShadeToggle
DestroyFunc ShadeToggle
AddToFunc   ShadeToggle I ThisWindow WindowShade


I use this in combination with:

ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle

for cleanness.

I really like if we support this demo. IMO software  patents
are  a serious thing which effects developing free software.
Past examples as gif or even the  current  discussion  about
the  linux  kernel  show what software patents and copyright
issues can cause. 

As seen software patents lead to the situation that only big
companies,  I don't want so say any names, can afford to use
certain patented  ideas,  algorithm  or  methods.  Companies
which  have  the money will buy patents and others will have
to pay them for that.

Having our web site not available for one day for that  good
reason is really worth it.

If nobody minds I could make  the  web  site  to  be  closed
completly  (all  pages  will not work even direct links like
www.fvwm.org/documentation/manpages), closed partialy  (only
the  entry  site will not work) or I could place a statement
about software patents on each page for that day. 

Cheers, Uwe

If all developers agree to participate in this event (by changing the web
site in one or another way) then the FVWM name may be used to protest
software patents in Europe. If any single participant disagrees then
everyone else should fight individually without using the FVWM name.

Personally I am surelly against software patents anywhere. However,
although I support this action, I don't think it will change anything.
Anyone who advocates software patents may hardly change her mind.

Technically I would show 2 versions of every page. The second is the real
one invoked with ?protested=1, the first version (if there is no such
variable passed) shows the protest page and a link to the real version.
This may be done for 3 days.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK. I guess I will have to add submenus to my root menu one by one.

The tree-like look of menu-submenu-submenu allows me to allways see 
where I'm coming from. A submenu title is in this case redundant. And 
it also costs time. I call the menu with a keyboard shortcut. When I 
[arrow] into the submenu of my choice, I have to do an extra [down-
arrow] to get onto something useful. That's ons keystroke extra for 
each time I enter a submenu. And when I press enter by mistake on a 
submenu name, I get an xterm in the dir of that submenu.

No, I would really like to get rid of the titles :-)

I (partly) works. I have two more questions though. I tried your 
PipeRead and it works fine, but when I combine it with the commands I 
already have (--icon-dir blah.xpm --exec-app '^exec') the menus don't 
work anymore.

If I use your piperead as-is, all my menu-entries (which are softlinks 
to programs) are opened with vim. Also, sub-sub-menus (since 
FvwmMenuDirectory works recursively -which is really nice-) still get a 
title.

OK, I will have a look at menu-desktop and wm-icons. Thanks again.

checking argument types of select()... configure: error: can't determine argument types

I'm using autoconf 2.57.
On the gnu-page they say, this is coming from the application.

Does anyone have an idea what I can do to install fvwm on my solaris? 

INSTALL.fvwm only states problems with xpm for solaris, but xpm is found.
Any help would be appreciated. 

Thanks, Reto

Huh?  We are using the stock AC_FUNC_SELECT test.  If that fails,
is *is* an autoconf bug.  Please do report this to the autoconf
developers.

> Does anyone have an idea what I can do to install fvwm on my solaris? 

Try a different autoconf version.  Or delete the corresponding
section from the configure script and hope it works without a
check.

I fully support this and would like to see the name "fvwm" being
used in a good cause.

I'm for closing down the site completely (with a statement, of
course).

      Of course, you're right.
      But it doesn't mean that we must stay quiet. My deep thought
is that we, as individual personns and/or teams must say what we
think about such questions. Perhaps only to be sure that we have
expressed our ideas ? Yes, but it's worth it. The same idea as for
voting. We can have personnal fights about all that stuff, some do
evangelisation, some explain things with facts, other with intuitions,
and some with faith, and some do collective things. All are good to
express ideas.

Ok, in the next versions (2.4.17 and 2.5.8) two things will be added. If
you specify --command-title "" then the title item is not choosable like
any normal menu Title; and if you specify --title "" then the title is
removed completely. Any of these should solve your keyboard navigation.

It should work, I can't say why it does not work for you without seeing
the exact configuration. Try to run this PipeRead command from the shell.

Hi Dominik

I tried to remove the check of socket.h, but then make fails somewhere.
Now I placed a question in the qnu-mailinglist, as you said.

Thank you for your fast answer.

Hi there,

I often work on different machines on the same network. The
machines have different OS-versions installed and different
versions of libraries avialable. To get the right
fvwm-version I try to start different versions in my
.xinitrc:

if /home/science/pross/installed/fvwm-2.5.7-installed/bin/fvwm -f /home/science/pross/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc-2.5.7  2> ~/.fvwm.log ; then 
    exit 0 ; 
elif /var/tmp/fvwm-2.5.6-installed/bin/fvwm -f /home/science/pross/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc-2.5.6  2> ~/.fvwm.log ; then 
    exit 0 ; 
elif ... 

My problem is that I need for each version a config file
since the ModulePath differs from version to version. All my
.fvwm2rc*-files look like this:

ModulePath /var/tmp/fvwm-2.5.6-installed/libexec/fvwm/2.5.6
Read FvwmConfig

Where FvwmConfig contains configuration statements for all
version. 

Is there a way the avoid the setting of FvwmModulePath? It
might be compiled in fvwm. 

Thanks in advance.

Regards Uwe

Why don't you just use the compiled in default?  Delete the
ModulePath line and you should be fine.

Thanks - Works on the machine I am now. Others will be
checked in the next days ;-)

My config has been grown for a while but I have never put
the ModulePath in question marks - It was just in the
config :-)

I had the same problem at home when I used stable and
unstable version with the same config - Life can be easy.

With autoconf 2.13 it builds without problems.

Hi there,

I just wondered if fvwm would be able to write its actual
configuration to a configuration file which can be read at
the next start. All function, menu and module definition
should be included.

Would it be possible to implement such a feature? Where
would be the constraints?

Regards, Uwe

I meant its actual settings like MenuStyle, environment
variables, function and menu definitions, key bindings,
module settings ... All this belongs to the actual
configuration.

Well, I don't mind what has changed I just want the actual
settings.

Uwe,

How do you mean? Most of what FVWM reads on invocation is all it needs to
operate, and anything that changes isn't really fvwm specific, but more
application specific.

You'll have to add it in manually. How is fvwm to know what has/has not
changed?

Have you looked at the man pages for FvwmSave and FvwmSaveDesk?

Or am I totally off track?

Respond to fvwm@fvwm.org.

Time for more information.

I'm configured to use gcc, I can try cc if that's what you are using.

Did you remove config-cache?

Are you using a snapshot or CVS?

If CVS did you run automake --add-missing && autoreconf?

Hi there,

Mmh, that's what I had feared. Function and menu
definitions are converted to internal pointer structures
from which the settings can not be derived?

Well, sometimes I think about a configuration tool for
fvwm. The best would be to make it running with fvwm, e.g.
tcl-tk or similar which issues fvwm-commands and pipes them
to FvwmCommand. In that case fvwm should be able to save
its own configuration.

Regards, Uwe

I have both, but when I see it correct, I'ts using gcc. 
It states it finds gnu c. I'm not sure how to say which one it uses really.

I think it would be possible to write functions to print
out some of the internal structures in close to their original
form, but I don't think its necessary or even desirable.

If you have a config tool and you feed its output into fvwm,
why not edit that output file and feed it to fvwm again?

I have to tool like that for my menu of rxvt's to remote systems
and it works fine.

Hmm, works on my Solaris 9 system, but not yours, using the
same autoconf and compiler...

Either you are missing a Solaris patch or ...

I'm pretty sure you will see details on the problem its having
with sys/socket.h in config.log.  Maybe you should look at that.

   Hi there.  I am wondering if it's possible to do
something with fvwm (2.4.4 currently installed).
I would like to have menu entries that perform
different actions based on modifiers.  Ideally,
they would also change their displayed text when
the modifier changed.

   So, I could have a menu of hosts to telnet to,
but when I pressed "Shift", the labels would all
change to "<host> (ssh)" rather than "<host>".
And if I selected that entry while the modifier
was held, it would ssh to it instead.  They
would of course be able to do *any* other action,
but this is the sort of place I'd expect to
want to do this.

   Does fvwm allow for this?  I'm 90% sure I've seen
some window manager or another that can do this.
Maybe it was enlightenment.  I don't recall.  But
I'm using fvwm now, and content to stay with it,
but this would be a really nice feature to keep
my menus smaller on screen, but have additional
options for the occasions that I need them.

   Thanks.

                          - Chris

Yes, but I'm not able to find a solution. I found the following two errors (and more of the first one) in config.log

Do you know a solution? My patches are from yesterday, so they should be ok.

This is not currently possible. But why don't you just define 2 menu
versions (they will be more readable then one bulky menu you suggest)
and fire them on different key bindings (for example one with Alt-F5
and another with Shift-F5):

  Key F5 A M Menu MySSHMenu
  Key F5 A S Menu MyTelnetMenu

With small tricks you may even define only one menu version, like this:

  Key F5 A M OpenMySSHMenu
  Key F5 A A OpenMyTelnetMenu

  AddToFunc OpenMySSHMenu
  + I DestroyFunc MyRemoteCommand
  + I AddToFunc   MyRemoteCommand
  + I + I Exec xterm -g 80x40 -bg darkred -e ssh $$0
  + I Menu MyShells

  AddToFunc OpenMyTelnetMenu
  + I DestroyFunc MyRemoteCommand
  + I AddToFunc   MyRemoteCommand
  + I + I Exec xterm -g 80x40 -bg darkgreen -e telnet $$0
  + I Menu MyShells

And the actual menu would look like this:

  AddToMenu MyShells
  + "%rterm.xpm%Poseidon" MyRemoteCommand poseidon
  + "%polar.xpm%Polaris"  MyRemoteCommand polaris
  ...

Not tested, but this technique should work.

Regards,
Mikhael.

"projid_t" should be typedefd as an "id_t" in sys/types.h
like this:

typedef id_t    projid_t;

In the same file "id_t" should be defined like this:

#if defined(_LP64) || defined(_I32LPx)
typedef uint_t nlink_t;                 /* file link type       */
typedef int     pid_t;                  /* process id type      */
#else
typedef ulong_t nlink_t;                /* (historical version) */
typedef long    pid_t;                  /* (historical version) */
#endif

You might have to create a test module and compile with -E to verify
that sys/types.h is getting included.

If you can be root, you can just go into
/usr/include/sys/stream.h and change projid_t to an int to verify
thats the problem.  Change it back when done.

  This would work.  It isn't ideal. but...  The comments on
complexity below still apply, however.

  That wouldn't work for me, really.  I don't want to change *all* of
the items in the menu.  Just one or two.  So, that would be a heck of
a lot of work just for part of a menu.  I guess that it actually would
*work*, but is a lot of effort.

  Also, any of this would only allow me to get it if I thought of
it before opening the menu or submenu.  And because I have
all of this built with M4 anyway, it'd be much more complicated
to do it that way.

  Can I request that this sort of feature be added in the future?
Having the menu entries change when modifiers are activated
and disactivated is kinda difficult, and configuring it is no small
feat either, but...  It would be very useful in the situations where
it's desired.  And doesn't hurt anything (except total code size
I guess) when it's not used...

                                             - Chris

I think it might lead to consistence problems if a
config tool does not get feedback from fvwm. Having fvwm
writing its config ensures a config file which represents
the actual state. Further the config tool could be
initialized by fvwm and does not need to read the config
file which ensures that both fvwm and the config tool are in
the same state.

The version of the protest page can be seen when adding 
?aswp=1 to any www.fvwm.org address.
http://www.fvwm.org?aswp=1
This site can be made as default for the protest time.

Could please anybody translate the first sentence of the
last paragraph to french?

Done.

By the way, I've some problem to browse my local copy of the
fvwm web site. For example if I open

   file:/home/olivier/fvwm/web/index.php

with Mozilla I get the php source. Any tips so that I can
browse my local copy of the fvwm web site as the web one?

That's normal ;-)

php statements are processed by a web server. The php
statements produce html code which is sent to the user's
browser.
To get the web page work you need a local installed web
server with php-4.3.x module. This should be available for
most distributions. Compiling apache and php is not that
hard. I did it on my box since I got an old suse linux dist
running for which the rpms are not available.

Once it is installed and proper configured you should get
access to the web server by using :

      http://localhost/
e.g.  http://localhost/fvwm-web

If you need some help for configuration please let me know. 
I have got all the statements for http.conf which are
necessary to get the fvwm-web site work.

Thanks for the translation.

Cheers, Uwe

Activating is quite simple.

In file definitions.inc line 270 needs to be changed from 

if( get_user_setting("no_software_patents") || ! get_user_setting("aswp") ) {

to 

if( get_user_setting("no_software_patents") ) {

to activate the protest site by default. 
To see the fvwm sites the string ?no_software_patents=1
needs to be added to the fvwm urls. The links at the protest
site do that automatically.

I could activate it Sunday or Monday. If there are no
protest I will activate the protest at Monday at latest. I
will also insert www.fvwm.org to the protest wiki. 

I am for leaving the site closed till Thursday or Friday.

Cheers, Uwe

Just installed appach and add this at the end of my httpd.conf

  Alias /fvwm-web /home/olivier/fvwm/web

  <Directory /home/olivier/fvwm/web>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
      Allow from 127.0.0.1
  </Directory>

works fine.

   I have not installed Gnome nor KDE; There is a way to change the pics,colours... used in
 the scrollbar, menubar... ? I don't want to use any external window manager.

   I have tried with Xdefaults, but the changes are related to separated applications. I want 
something more radical.

   Thanks

That's fine! Could you add FVWM to the Wiki at
http://wiki.ael.be/index.php/OnlineDemoPartnersWebsites ? It's always
nice to have as many sites listed there as possible.

Unless all your applications use a GUI toolkit to implement their
widgets (i.e. scrollbars etc.), there is no way to achieve this.

Hi there,

I activated the protest page and added www.fvwm.org to the
wiki. Currently there are more than 400 web sites in the
wiki - wow
  http://wiki.ael.be/index.php/OnlineDemoPartnersWebsites

The protest site at fvwm.org will be displayed if  the  http
referer  variable  does not contain www.fvwm.org. This means
that any link from a other web site to  www.fvwm.org/*  will
show  the protest page. Links within the fvwm domain supress
the protest page. 

> I am for leaving the site closed till Thursday or Friday.

Let's hope we can bring some people to think.

Cheers, Uwe

Changing pics is quite difficult for some applications for
others nearly impossible. 

Colors for more than one x-application can be set using
x-resource with wildcards e.g. 

*background: #f0f0f0
*foreground: #000000
*borderwidth: 3

For kde-applications there is a file ~/.kderc. Gtk (gnome)
applications use the settings in file ~/.gtkrc.mine. All
three settings could be made due shell-scripts or fvwm.

Hello. :-)

I did manage to make pseudo-transparent menus, but now I'd like
to make something more "real".  What I'd like to do is to have
something like there is in KDE.

It should work like this:
 1. user clicks thus calling a Menu.
 2. current screen dump is taken (with all the windows, but
    without a menu just as yet).
 3. this screen dump is made available to Menu as
    root background pixmap.
 4. Menu is displayed with tinted real background.

This way it's pretty easy to make an illusion of real
transparency (and looks "l33t", as some may say).

My question is, how to do it to, and make it good.  I came up
with a function which would call xwd, convert and fvwm-root
and then call Menu.  Which is slow (convert) and does set
background instead of just making it "virtually" available
to Menu...


Second question -- Xrender.  AFAIK this extension allows
making windows really transparent/translucent without using
any of these tricks.  I know fvwm has Xrender support, but
is there a way (magical fvwm2rc lines :)) to enable
Xrendered translucent windows? :-)

   Regards,
     Dawid

Hi.

I am setting up diskless terminals for users in a rough environment.
so there are no mouses either.

i hide the mousepointer with the "unclutter" program. works well.

i setup the fvwm config to have no decorations no menus no fancy stuff.

but what i need now is that all new windows are centered on screen. i cannot
find an option for this. instead they are placed topleft, or if they
are dialogs, they are centered in their mother window.

i am using Qt library to develop my program.

is there a way to center all new windows????


cu & thx
erik

I don't know about Qt, but in plain X, you can set the win_gravity
field of the window's size hints to CenterGravity with
XSetWMNormalHints() and use (XDisplayWidth() / 2,
XDisplayHeight() / 2) as its starting position.

See Q 3.18 in the fvwm FAQ for a description how you can do it
with the window manager.

Hi together,

I am in setting up a fvwm installation for a number of
people. Is there a default configuration file for fvwm or is
the default compiled in only?
I checked my local installation but there does not seem a
default config in it. I would prefer a system wide config
since it is simpler to maintain.

As always ;-) Thanks in advance.

Cheers, Uwe

There are a couple of built-in defaults and the ConfigFvwmDefaults
file.  Other than that, the man page describes how fvwm looks for
its config file:

       Fvwm first searches for configuration files  using the
       command

            Read .fvwm2rc

       This  looks  for  .fvwm2rc in $HOME/.fvwm or $FVWM_USERDIR
       directories, as described in Read below.  If  this  fails,
       fvwm also searches for this file in the $HOME directory or
       for system.fvwm2rc file in the system place.  If a config
       uration file is not found, any mouse button or the Help or
       F1 keys on the root window brings up menus and forms  that
       can create a starting configuration file.

Put your config file in:

    /full/filename/of/systemwide/configfile

Then ask your users to put:

    Read /full/filename/of/systemwide/configfile

in their $HOME/.fvwmrc.

The system place it the one given with the --prefix option
during configuration?

I do not think that you will succeed to have something which
works by using this method. fvwm cannot do what you ask,
maybe in the future.

Xrender does not allows to make window transparent. This is
a legend (which comes from a screenshot). Xrender can be
used to apply 2 images in one via an alpha channel (an
obvious example is tinting). You can do that without Xrender,
but with Xrender you may hope that the operation is faster
(e.g., hardware acceleration).

i would implement a wrapper to the Popup command, TransMenuPopup for
example, ive been playing around and its definitiely possible (its a
little laggy if you want to tint it, like i have below, but the effect
is nice)

I'm not sure if theres anyway of getting the geometry of a menu before
its drawn, so ive just grabbed a menu size chunk here (edit to fit your
menus)

# Usage: TransMenuPopup [MenuName]
DestroyFunc TransMenuPopup
AddToFunc TransMenuPopup
+ I PipeRead "echo SetEnv tr_menu_face /tmp/fvwm_$${RANDOM}.xpm"
+ I PipeRead "import -window root -crop \

Unless specified differently, it's

(The data directory in the configure summary with <version>

ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/CHAIRMAN.
CEO/MD

First, may I solicit your confidentiality in this transaction, this by virtue of its nature. I am Mr Lutherking taylor Jr, a cousin to the president Charles Taylor of Liberia . As a result of the increasing rebel hostility in my country and the recent indictment of Charles Taylor by the international war crimes tribunal, he has mandated me to look for a reliable partner who will urgently assist in the collection of consignment of boxes containing cash of (US$22.5M) he kept in safe custody with a security management company in Spain and it is registered as farmily valiables.


We need a foreigner whom we will portray as the bona-fide owner of the consignment to prevent the company from finding out the consignment belongs to president Taylor and thereby confiscating such because of the current military fiasco in my country. Thereafter, this fund will be invested to your company or you advice us on any lucrative project to put the fund into.

The president has handed over to me the title documents, and all necessary arrangements have been made to perfect the business . I will want to be guaranteed that you will be able to handle this huge amount of money for an investment project.Upon receipt of your positive response, I will suggest we meet possible in Spain for us to work out modalities concerning the investment of the money and the ratio you will receive after the collection of the boxes from the security company in Spain.




Therefore , I will be grateful if you handle this as top priority because this is one opportunity we can not afford to loose. Please contact me on this email address( taylor_jr@excite.com or taylor_jnr@excite.com) I urge you to please keep this transaction very confidential, as I am expecting your urgent reply to indicate your interest, however if you are not interested to assist us, you let me know urgently to enable me contact another willing partner.


Tel: +34-680-902-518
Best Regards

Lutherking Taylor Jr

The data directory is actually <prefix>/share/fvwm.

As for the original question, I would just put "fvwm-themes-start"
instead of "fvwm" to the user's start up scripts and stop to worry.
The users then could choose themselves any look and feel they want
(or leave the default theme).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi!

Im using fvwm 2.4.6 on Debian Woody. There are three Buttons on the right
hand side with the following functions:

2 Close
4 Maximise
6 Iconify

I wondered about the strange way Buttons were left out on transient windows,
which made no sense and furthermore did the Close-Button look pressed on
maximized windows. I tried changing this with

ButtonStyle 6 - MwmDecorMin
ButtonStyle 4 - MwmDecorMax
ButtonStyle 2 - Clear

without luck. I temporarily work around this problem by putting the
Minimize- and Maximize-Buttons to the rightmost position, what seems to be
what everyone is expecting. But I really want Iconify, Maximize, Close in
that order from left to right. Ill attach my fvwm2rc and post.hook, which
gets included after all command in fvwm2rc, to this mail.

BTW, is there a way to _always_ show all Buttons on every window (except
ones without a border at all, eg. xmms etc.)?

Regards
lal

# This file can be used both as the system.fvwmrc and the per-user

# It uses certain `hooks' (files stored in /etc/X11/fvwm or ~/.fvwm) to allow
# the system administrator and user to modify menus, colors, and so on without
# having to change this file.
#
# The defaults that this file sets up follow my own taste.  They attempt to set
# up a nice, easy, comfortable environment for the "ordinary" user.  However,
# using the hooks, it should be possible to change anything.
#
# Please read /usr/share/doc/fvwm/README.sysrc.gz for more information.
#
# Hopefully, you will never have to modify this file.
#

#
# Section: pre.hook

# Use pre.hook for things that need to be done before anything else.
# For example, various paths (IconPath, PixmapPath, ModulePath) might

#
# These settings are personal.
# If you need to modify them, do so in post.hook.

#
# DeskTopSize sets the size of the desktop in units of physical screen
# `pages'.  I prefer to use a single desktop with multiple pages,
# but many people like having multiple desktops.  I thinks its confusing.
#

DeskTopSize 3x3

#
# I like to be able to move between pages or desks simply by moving
# the mouse against the screen border.  I find it very useful.  The
# following command enables this behaviour.  To disable it, the
# command EdgeScroll 0 0 could be placed in the post.hook.
#

EdgeScroll 100 100

#
# When moving a window against the edge of the screen, it is

# Section: Init and restart functions
#
# This section defines the functions InitFunction and RestartFunction.
# InitFunction is executed automatically when fvwm first starts.
# RestartFunction is executed automatically when fvwm restarts itself.
# They share a common hook, init-restart.hook, and two specific hooks,
# init.hook and restart.hook.
#
# init-restart.hook should be used for starting fvwm modules, such as the
# button bar.  init-hook should be used to start other applications; they
# should not be started again, when fvwm is restarted, since they don't
# die like fvwm modules do.  restart.hook exists mostly for completeness;
# tell me if you find any use for it.
#
# InitFunction runs the script setup-background, which looks in
# ~/.fvwm to see if the user wants some specific background color or
# image.
#
# The init.hook, init-restart.hook and restart.hook files should
# contain continuation lines, eg:
#   + "I" Exec xterm

# Section: Menus
#
# This section defines a small menu structure.  The main menu contains
# some typical entries, and uses a hook (main-menu.hook) to allow the
# user to add new entries.  Most of the default entries are submenus,
# which are also defined here.

# MWM style menus are easier to use and better for Windows refugees.

# Section: Key bindings
#
# This section binds some actions to keys.  The bindings have been inspired
# by MWM, Windows, and nightmares.  Everything that these key bindings do,
# can be done without them.  Therefore they should not be too much of a
# burden on new users, but it definitely _can_ be confusing to press a
# key by accident and have it do something completely unexpected.

I had a try with fvwm-themes. I installed  it  as  described
but after starting it there is no theme selection at all. In
one of my logfiles there is a message which  seems  to  come
from fvwm-themes: 

Can't load module Data::Dumper, dynamic loading not available in this perl.
  (You may need to build a new perl executable which either supports
  dynamic loading or has the Data::Dumper module statically linked into it.)
 at /home/4all/packages/fvwm-2.5.7/themes/bin/fvwm-themes-config line 618

Could this state the cause for the failure? Is there a way
to get it run without upgrading perl?

Cheers, Uwe

"dynamic loading not available in this perl"?

This is the first time I see report. Did you compile perl yourself and
disable some features at compile time? It seems unlikely that any
distributer distributes perl without such core feature.

After searching in Google, one of the possible reasons may be your
libperl.so not corresponding to your perl executable, that is f.e. at:

  /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/CORE/libperl.so

It seems that your perl instalation is partially broken, so I suggest to
install some distibuted binary package (or compile yourself).

Otherwise, what happens if you comment our the "require Data::Dumper;"
line and add "use Data::Dumper;" at the beginning of the script?

Regards,
Mikhael.

You pointed it out :-) I am on the university network  where
a  lot  versions  of programs are installed. I compiled fvwm
and fvwm-themes on a solaris 5.6 machine to get  it  run  at
most  of  our boxes. This machine has no own perl so it uses
one provided by the university's network. My  box  has  it's
own  perl  so  there  was actually a dynamic link problem. I
have changed the path to perl in fvwm-themes-config  and  it
works ;-) 

As we say the problem is always  sitting  in  front  of  the
keyboard :-) 

Thanks for your help.

Cheers, Uwe

Hi!

Is it possible that icons are ignored if fvwm looks for a location where to
place a window in MinOverlapPlacement style?

The correct way is of course to install fvwm and fvwm-themes after
setting either PATH or PERL to point to the correct perl, like
/usr/univ/perl5.005.

Otherwise you may manually edit the first script lines, but you should do
this for all fvwm-* and fvwm-themes-* scripts, not just one script.

Mikhael.

I can't reproduce what you say.

If I create this minimal .fvwm2rc file, the correct buttons are removed,
for example, in Find dialog of Netscape:

  Style * DecorateTransient, MWMButtons, MWMFunctions

  ButtonStyle 1 - Clear MwmDecorMenu
  ButtonStyle 2 - Clear
  ButtonStyle 4 - Clear MwmDecorMax
  ButtonStyle 6 - Clear MwmDecorMin

  Mouse 0 1 A Menu MenuFvwmRoot
  Mouse 0 2 A Close
  Mouse 0 4 A Maximize
  Mouse 0 6 A Iconify

You may also run the first 5 lines in FvwmConsole to verify they work.

Are you sure the correct configuration is executed? Try to create the
.fvwm2rc from scratch by adding something, verifying it works, adding
something else and so on.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I did that and fvwm-themes starts now as expected. But
I  cannot  do  a  theme  change. After selecting for example
"Theme Management" -> "CDE" -> "[all]" nothing happens apart
from  that  all windows do not get focus anymore so I cannot
type anything in shells  etc.  even  mouse  clicks  are  not
accepted. Only restart seems to help. 

There are no meaningful entries in the log files. The only
thing which seems to come from fvwm-theme is

[FVWM][expand_vars]: <<DEPRECATED>> Use $[version.line] instead of $v
[FvwmScript][ReadConfig]: <<ERROR>> Can't open the script FvwmScript-NoteMessage

... wait ...

I got it work. I copied all scripts from 

<path>/packages/fvwm-2.5.7/themes/share/fvwm

to 

<path>/packages/fvwm-2.5.7/share/fvwm

and started over. Theme switching works now :-) 

Wonderfull!!! Thanks again.

Uwe

Using the CDE theme one gets black foreground on black
background. Any hints how to change this?

Yeah, youre right. With your minimal .fvwm2rc it works. Must be a problem
with my configuration interfering with the Debian defaults.. Ill investigate
it further. Thanks for your help.

Hi!

I think Ive tackled the problem down to the UseDecor Style. Consider this
fvwm2rc:

DestroyDecor defaultdec
AddToDecor defaultdec
+ ButtonStyle Reset

#Style * UseDecor defaultdec

Style * DecorateTransient, MWMButtons, MWMFunctions

ButtonStyle 1 - Clear MwmDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 2 - Clear
ButtonStyle 4 - Clear MwmDecorMax
ButtonStyle 6 - Clear MwmDecorMin

Mouse 0 1 A Menu MenuFvwmRoot
Mouse 0 2 A Close
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize
Mouse 0 6 A Iconify


If you comment the line with UseDecor out youll get the strange button
behaviour. Or at least _I_ get it on my system ;)

Regards
lal

"dynamic loading not available in this perl"?

This is the first time I see report. Did you compile perl yourself and
disable some features at compile time? It seems unlikely that any
distributer distributes perl without such core feature.

After searching in Google, one of the possible reasons may be your
libperl.so not corresponding to your perl executable, that is f.e. at:

  /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/CORE/libperl.so

It seems that your perl instalation is partially broken, so I suggest to
install some distibuted binary package (or compile yourself).

Otherwise, what happens if you comment our the "require Data::Dumper;"
line and add "use Data::Dumper;" at the beginning of the script?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Humm, ... in fact some code in fvwm was already there for this.

Apply the attached patch to the current cvs (really current)
or to the next snapshot and use the following config:

Colorset 5 Transparent, Tint black 50
MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, PopupOffset 0 100, AnimationOff

and you get what you want :o)

However, I do not think that such patch will be applied before
fvwm-2.6.

Uwe, please spend some minutes and install fvwm and then fvwm-themes
properly (i.e. using "./configure; make; make install") without any
copying of directories or correcting paths, otherwise you will surely
experience problems in one or another place.

Then if there is any problem, I will be glad to help. The CDE and Luthien
themes depend on FvwmM4 and awk, in case the problem still persists.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Found it.  The failure is at line 1726 of fvwm/functions.c, in routine
execute_complex_function:

  if (!GrabEm(CRS_NONE, GRAB_NORMAL))

so StartFunction and/or InitFunction fails.  I'm guessing both fvwm
instances are trying to grab the pointer, but one of them can't.  I see
the comment above it, so I understand the reasoning.  I'm just wondering
- should StartFunction and InitFunction perhaps be immune from pointer
grab failures?

I had some trouble applying the patch, so I applied the troublesome bits
manually and made another diff...  Strangely, my diff doesn't look
significantly different from yours, but my version of patch had trouble
with the one attached to your message...

I like the effect this provides... it's not perfect (of course, you
can't get perfect behavior in X yet), but it works pretty nicely, and
since menus are fairly transient anyway, it's not too likely that
whatever they're over top of will change.

It is more likely that the menu itself moves, as in animated menus.

Yes, but this can be more or less fixed (I do not handle this case,
I wrote the patch just for fun). Anyway, I suggested AnimationOff
and no menu overlapping: PopupOffset 0 100.

Yes. However, the patch does not use translucence when the menu is
a tear-off menu. When, the menu is tear-off the usual Transparent
colorset is used, so you need:

Style fvwm_menu ParentalRelativity

and if you have some tint the stuff may be broken (see the FvwmTheme
man page about tinting the Transparent colorset).  By the way,
Transparent and RootTransparent colorset are broken with tear-off
menu: the menu bg is not updated when you move the window or on a bg
change (with a compliant "setbg" apps). This may (should/must ?) be
fixed before 2.6. I Recall that at some point tear-off menu was
declared as "possibly disabled for 2.6". But this is not the case
anymore.

You are right I copied some files  and  adapted  some  paths
since  it  is  not that easy to get it work on many machines
for many users. Some users have different settings  of  PATH
and  LD_LIBRARY_PATH  and  on  machines  do not have a local
installed perl or gawk. 
That's the cause I played around. Most times it works on  my
box,  but  asking my collegue shows that it is different for
another user and/or machine.

I copied (again I know :) the file "colors" from the default
theme  to  the cde directory. So I got now this color scheme
with CDE. This works - I think we don't need different color
settings for CDE so this workaround is sufficient. 

Thanks again, Mikhael, for the help and the hints.

Cheers, Uwe

BTW: Good work on fvwm-themes :-) For most  users  having  a
window  manager  that  preconfigured  is good since they can
immediately start working and have a nice and  useable  look
too.  Hopefully I get the time to integrate my fvwm settings
in a theme ;-)

At least they should wait until the pointer can be grabbed.

Thanks for participating!

BTW, we haven't made up our mind yet, whether we should encourage web
sites to continue protesting until the end of September, or not.

To sum it up in English:  partially due to the protests, the
acclamation in the EU parliament has been deferred until end of
September or later.

I am for continuation protesting since the matter  is  quite
serious.  The last court decision about a sw patent of Eolas
which claims m$ has used its technique for embedded links is
a  very  good example (even if I think m$ can afford to lose
some  lawsuits).  Even  the  w3c  is  concerned  about  this
decision  since  it  may effect all plugin techniques. Maybe
this decision will help to avoid sw patents in europe. 

I suggest to put a statement on top of each page which shows
our  protest  against  sw  patents.  But I could go with the
current protest page as well.

Any other thoughts/opinions?

Cheers, Uwe

Hallo list!

Will emacs-like key sequences find their way in fvwm somewhen? I would
really  like to see such bindings like Mod4 m s for maximize to screen
and Mod4 m v for maxmize vertically...

So am I.  I think the issue is serious enough to maintain
the protest until the end.  Or at least for some time more.

The form of the prostest is not annoying (pop-up windows
certainly would be... :)) and it cound bring other people
to actively support the case.  Even if there is only slight
chance of it, it's worth doing.

He's asking for key sequences, not just a single key with a modifier.

I don't think it can be done reliably.

You could use "Mod4 m" to start a module that did a keyboard grab
for the next key, but I don't think the module would start quickly
enough.

You could do it with a menu, and a menu hotkey, which would be
fast enough, but would cause something visible to appear.

I guess you could make the menu fully transparent, but thats not
really what the OP was asking for.

How about setting an environment variable which is toggled on or off with
the escape key and then bind a function to other keys which checks to see
if the environment variable is set?  If it is, then do something like
maximize vertically and clear the env. var.?

If you want, post an example, but I think the OP was looking for:

Key m<4>,v w Maxmize 0 1

which, of course, doesn't exist.

Being a multi-key sequence, it would cause the same kinds
of problems that multi-click sequences cause.  Ie. you have to
wait a while before you can figure out if its a sequence you need
to trap, or if it gets passed to the application.

   oops, didn't notice. but IIRC there's a way in X windows to specify 
multi-key events - that might make it impossible to use those keys as 
separate keys though (so emacs might not work)

That would double the possible keysequences but not bring seom order to them...

That's exactly what i want. If you rely just on your keyboard for
managing windows and start applications with shortcuts your keyboard
gots really fast to small. And between, keysequences are easier to
remember as they set a special orders to functions - that could be
because my mind is a little bit emacs-twisted... :)

I use Caps_Lock as modifier for fvwm and these keybindings are never
usefull to applications - that mean i never found a app using
Caps_Lock. I could also live with disable all one-lick bindings if that
would be easier?!

Here a new version of the patch for current cvs/snapshot.
This patch add a new options to Colorset: Translucent/NoTranslucent.
These options has effects only with (non tear-off) menu.
Also menu animation is "handled".

For example with:

  Colorset 5 fg yellow, bg blue, HGradient 200 lightblue darkblue, \
	  Translucent blue 60
  Style * MenuColorset 5, PopupOffset 0 100, AnimationOff

you get translucent menus (with a 60% blue tint) and if you tear-off
a menu the menu use the gradient.

Regards, Olivier
