This is why I keep saying "that should probably be done in a module"
whenever people suggest features that don't necessarily have to be
part of the main exec (as long as it's possible to do what they want
under a module).  I dislike creeping featurism as well.

The module idea was definitely a winner.

I started using FvwmCpp yesterday, and I think there's a bug with the -cppopt
option. Lines 123 through 127 of FvwmCpp.c currently are:

123:  if(mystrcasecmp(argv[i],"-cppopt") == 0)
124:    {
125:      strcat(cpp_options, argv[i]);
126:      strcat(cpp_options, " ");
127:    }

I believe that should be argv[++i] instead of argv[i] in line 125. The
current code just passes the string "-cppout" to cpp, which isn't very useful.
I'm currently using patchlevel 34, and I just downloaded 35, and it's the same
in there.

I've been trying to build fvwm on my Solaris 2.4 system.

I believe that the README.Install file ought to at least mention the
fact that people who are trying to build this on Solaris will need to
also fetch, build, and install the xpm library (and associated header
files) from ftp.x.org.  (Neither the header file(s) nor the library
for xpm are present by default on Solaris systems.)

Currently I am running FVWM on a Sparc10 (Sun OS4_1_3) and can't seem to
get it to exit gracefully. I either need to kill the console (started in
.xsession with an xterm -C) or do a kill -9 X(pid).  Does anybody have an
idea why I'm having this problem? If so, what can I do to fix it?

Thanks for your help.

There are some styles that aren't documented. For instance, what is
SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement? 

On a related note, I use RandomPlacement, but I don't like the way it starts
at +0+0. I'd like it to start a little further down and to the right, say,
+50+50. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks.

Actually, that info is in the configure.h file where #define XPM is
described.  But yes, it should be in the README as well.  I'll add it
now.

BTW - check out the new address for the mailing list (no longer on

I already added these to the man page for the next release, basically
taken from the fvwm 1.xx man page:

               RandomPlacement causes windows which would normally
               require user placement to be automatically placed in
               ever-so- slightly random locations.  For the best of
               all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and
               SmartPlacement.

               SmartPlacement causes windows which would normally
               require user placement to be automatically placed in a
               smart location - a location in which they do not
               overlap any other windows on the screen. If no such
               position can be found user placement or random
               placement will be used as a fall-back method.  For the
               best of all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement
               and SmartPlacement.

Not currently.

I neglected to change my procmail filter when the mailing list changed
addresses, and am temporarily reading it directly through rmail, which
uses rmail-ignored-headers, which I had been previously setting to nil.
I have it fixed now.  Sorry for the off-topic mail.

I'm having a problem with FrameMaker now, which must be related to fvwm.
This is kind of complicated, so I hope I can be clear enough.

I have two desktops, Misc (0) and Maker (1). All Maker windows start on 
desk 1. My InitFunction declaration looks like this:

AddToFunc InitFunction  "I" Module FvwmPager 0 1
+                       "I" Module FvwmAuto 200
+                       "I" Exec toolwait /usr/openwin/bin/cm -WP 85 0 -i3 
+                       "I" Wait Newmail
+                       "I" Exec exec /usr/local/frame/bin/maker
+                       "I" Exec newterm -g 80x45+0+150 &
+                       "I" Wait Maker
+                       "I" Desk 0 0

Maker starts up fine (if slowly). However, as soon as I open a file, it dies
with no error message. I can bring it up again by hand and it works fine.

Any idea what's causing this?

My second question (I seem to always have a second question) is why isn't
FvwmPager affected by FvwmAuto? That is, why doesn't it autoraise like
everything else?

Thanks.

Gail

I've just noticed some lossage using XEmacs-19.14b3 and fvwm-2pl35. If
anyone has a similar combination, can you please verify or discount
the following? 

After selecting the Restart option of fvwm (Restart fvwm), XEmacs
redisplay of minibuffers is lost. \C-x\C-f doesn't echo in the
minibuffer, and cursor movement keys do not appear to
work. Fortunately, the (blind) input is still recognized so that I can
\C-x 5 2 to get a new frame which works.

Actually, the above happens with XEmacs-19.13 as well, so I'm inclined
to think it's a problem with fvwm-2pl35.

Does anyone else see this behavior after an fvwm Restart?

Is fvwm the last thing started in your .xsession? From the sounds of it,
you have the 'xterm -C' as the last item.

Try changing it so that fvwm is the last thing run (but dont run it in
the background!) Once fvwm exits, the .xsession script ends, and xdm will 
end the session.

Since configure.h lets us specify where to put the binaries, I think
it would be natural to also let us specify where the man-pages should
go. Especially since I know nothing about Imake :)

Another thing I haven't seen in the man-page are anything about the
Windows-lookalike shortcuts that can be used in menus. I found this litte nice
feature when I was looking into the code for another reason. Just put an &
before the letters that should act as shortcuts.

I'm running 2.0 patchlevel 33.

Since the name of the program defaults to fvwm2, one should probably
update to sample config-file to "Restart fvwm2".

Yup - I'll fix this for the next release.

I'm trying to do this for the next release.  Unfortunately, I don't
know a lot about Imake either, so it's slow going.

I just noticed something like this yesterday, actually, except for me
it was a big chunk of the XEmacs frame that was blanked out (the whole
lower & left hand quadrant).  I haven't looked into it yet.

I'm using fvwm2 on a HP/712 running 9.05, and every once in a while my
configuration will come up, and things won't be quite right.  I won't
have buttons on some windows.  I may have to physically place windows
eventhough they should be auto placed.  I sometimes even loose mouse
focus all together,  and am forced to cut and paste letters into my
xterm, which I use as my magic cookie, so that I can log out.

It's as though fvwm was multi-threaded and one thread is reading the
configuration file, and another thread is starting up the system, and
there's no synchronization between the two, ie. the reading thread
doesn't finish before the configuration thread starts.  

I am using the FvwmM4 stuff to pre-process my .fvwm2rc file, is it
possible that fvwm isn't waiting for this processing to finish before
continuing on?

Am I the only one to see this behavior?

Thanks,
Shane

Just as another datum point ( :-) data points? ), I found that I get
the same problem using fvwm-2pl31.

However, I've also had personal e-mail indicating the problem does not
exist with XEmacs-19.11, though I don't know the platform/fvwm version
combination for this latter report. This prompted me to test
XEmacs-19.11 under fvwm-2pl35 here (Solaris-2.3), and I can verify it
works correctly. Unfortunately XEmacs-19.12 is not available to test
here anymore.

So, the problem appears to be related to the (more) hairy handling of
X and/or X events in XEmacs, if not an XEmacs bug itself.

This would be nice to fix (in either fvwm or XEmacs) but if time
pressures don't permit a fix, perhaps a note should be put in a BUGS
file in fvwm. I'd bet a lot of people are moving to XEmacs-19.13 or
later...

I have a similar problem. When I re-start fvwm it will sometime not put
a frame/titlebar  around one of my XEmacs windows. The window will get
focus correctly, it just doesn't have a frame. All the other XEmacs
windows work fine. Using fvwm 2.0-pl33 and XEmacs 19.13 on an SGI
running IRIX 5.3. I have not played around enough to determine under
what conditions the problem can be repeated.

Apparently.  But it might be related to the occasional odd XEmacs
display behavior problems that are being reported recently.  Perhaps
there is something happening that is causing a race condition in the X
server or something like that.

Would everyone that is seeing odd problems like this please run fvwm2
with the -debug parameter and see if the problems continue.  All this
does is run XSynchronize(dpy,1);, which may cause problems to more
clearly show up, or go away, or might not show anything.  I'm merely
curious.

Another possibility - what level of optimization is everyone compiling
with?  -O3 and greater sometimes causes strange problems with
programs, so I'd say keep it at -O2 or just -O.

Thanks,
Chuck

	I just wanted to bring something up that I notice periodically
when I use fvwm (less and less as time goes by, but whenever I have 
used Mwm recently :)
	Click on a title bar. (or the move icon) Now move your window 
around. See how the outline flashes ever so slightly as you move it?
It is much more noticible for side-to-side motion, in case that helps.
	I've used fvwm under Ultrix, OSF/1, SunOS, and HP-UX, and it
has this behaviour on every OS. When you use Mwm, however, the movement
of window outlines is smooth and even.
	The general impression that this behaviour gives fvwm is that
it is slow to respond and just ever so slightly unpolished.
	How difficult would it be to fix the window movement routines
so that they are just ever so slightly smoother?

	Oh, this is of course fvwm 1.24r -- but I believe that 2.0
does the same thing.

No, the problem disappears. But, man, does it sloooowww fvwm down ;-).

I couldn't get it to fail after four restarts, but the fifth restart
*did* fail. Ugh. Doesn't look like a fun one to find.

This is what I fond in my logfile -- the first one is my fault for
(foolishly) putting a "Restart fvwm -debug" in my menu w/o checking
the manual.

FVWM: Call of 'fvwm -debug' failed!!!!

I just compared 2.0, 1.24r, and MWM (1.2.4) in this regards, and I
don't really see where fvwm looks bad.  Either version.  I see a
*slight* flicker in the the movement, but I can see it in MWM as well.

It is slightly more noticible in fvwm though, I think because the
outline is one or two pixels thicker, plus fvwm has the extra lines
through the middle of the outline as well.  If the thickness were
reduced and those lines removed, I think that the two would look
exactly the same.  I'll experiment with changing the thickness and see
if it matters.

Eli>    The general impression that this behaviour gives fvwm is that

I don't think it gives that impression at all, although it is slightly
unpolished.  What do you want for free? :)  It's hopefully getting
better all the time though.

Eli>    How difficult would it be to fix the window movement routines
Eli> so that they are just ever so slightly smoother?

Don't know.  I'll look into what I mentioned above and see.

This is a good thing to point out right here I think.  Whenever
posting bug reports, please make sure that you specify what version of
fvwm it is seen on.

I just ftp'd pl36. I haven't compiled it yet, but I noticed something that I
noticed in previous versions and forgot about. Throughout the FAQ and 
fvwm.man (may be in other places, but I didn't check), the word "quote" is
spelled "qoute". This is true for "quoting" and other variations. If this is
a typo, it's a pretty consistent one.

Is there still a problem with the FvwmWindowList window drifting on 
the screen whenever a window is added/removed/changed?  This is the 
most annoying thing!  I haven't upgraded my FVWM because of that...  
Thanks for letting me know.

XPMINCLUDE is still not getting into the Makefiles. As a result, even though
I set XPMINCLUDE to "/work/include", I get a lot of stuff like this from
MakeMakefiles:

makedepend:  icons.c: makedepend:  cannot find include file "X11/xpm.h"

I just realized *why* XPMINCLUDE isn't getting used. Actually, it is, but
not properly.

This is from fvwm/Imakefile:

EXTRA_INCLUDES = -I. $(XPMINCLUDE)

This should be:

EXTRA_INCLUDES = -I. XPMINCLUDE

Easy to fix. :)

One more follow-up...

The line that I quoted from fvwm/Imakefile is easily edited and then it
works, but only for the fvwm directory. 

The Imakefiles for the modules and for xpmroot have not been updated and
thus don't have EXTRA_INCLUDES or FVWM_MAN_DIR.

Two final comments on pl36 before I go home for the day:

FVWM_MAN_DIR should be set, not to "/whatever/man/man" but
"/whatever/man/mann". Really, though, it should be MANPATH that's changes,
so that you can just set it to "/whatever/man".

FvwmIdent is doing what it did in pl34. When I click in it, fvwm crashes.
That is, X windows dies and I'm at the shell prompt in console mode. There's
no error message or anything to let me know why it crashes.

Okay, that's it for today. Two days, actually, as I'm off tomorrow. I expect
to see a flurry of messages when I get back on Thursday. :)

Howdy, fellow users of this fine window manager.

I shifted to FVWM 2.0.x recently and, though generally very pleased, have 
had one or two small but nagging problems (note - I am using FVWM 2.0.27 
on a Linux PC running kernel 1.2.13 at the moment):

1.  Occasionally I have problems when I double-click an icon, or
iconify a window, that the new window or icon (respectively) pops up on a
different page (same desktop, though).  I have to look at my pager window 
to see where the hell the thing got sent, and then have to go and get it 
back.  Only happens every once in a while.  Any ideas?

2.  From my experience with FVWM 1.24 I'm used to clicking/double-clicking
on the title bar of a window to raise or lower it and a click-motion to 
move it.  Seems that something's changed in 2.0.27 (and 2.0.34 which I've 
tried as well) with button presses or something which makes it very hard 
to click once on a title bar without having the click-motion behaviour 
kick in.  That is, often when I do what I think is a single click to 
raise a window, I end up inadvertently moving it due to post-click 
motion.  Any thoughts on that one?  

Thanks very much for such outstanding support.  I *know* W95 users would 
be green if they saw how easy it was for us folks to get things 
straightened out...
Cheers,

Dave

I had this happen *once* (this week) with fvwm-1.22t and GNU Emacs
19.28. I have been using this combination for over 6 months now.

Mind you, I don't do Restart very much now that I'm happen with my
.fvwmrc.

Subject: FVWM: Virtual desktop scrolling with Xemacs & VM
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92
content-length: 1059

I'm using fvwm 2.0 pl 33 on Linux.  All I have to report is a very
minor bug: whenever I run "xemacs -f vm" and go to an empty screen
before it comes up, the window appears at the upper left hand corner.
(I'm using SmartPlacement or whatever it's called.)  In the middle of
the loading process, the window self-expands slightly in width.  Then
after the program is finished loading, I can't scroll across the top
or left boundaries of the screen with the mouse pointer anywhere
inside the Xemacs window.  This situation is also very temporary,
since any virtual desktop scrolling as well as many window manager
activities end it.

Also, I have a suggestion for an improvement: it would be nice if
there were an option to make SmartPlacement look through the whole
virtual desktop for free space for a window, so I wouldn't have to
switch to an empty screen before a program had time to start up.

Destroying modules makes the X display hang.

No customization, vanilla system.fvwmrc.  I discovered this behaviour
while I loading a second ButtonBar via the Popup-Menu.

To reproduce the bug: choose "Destroy" from the menu and click on the
ButtonBar.  fvwm wipes the ButtonPictures away but leave a somehow red
background.  Now no input via mouse or keyboard isn't possible.

It also hangs, if I try the Banner module; when the Banner thinks it's
time to disappear, it freezes the display.

If you need more info, please aks.  Best whishes, Karl.

Actually I had already put a note about this in the pl36 BUGS file.
Destroy should NEVER be used to close an application unless Close
doesn't work.  From the fvwm man page:

          Destroy
               Destroys an application window, which usually causes
               the application to crash and burn.

This is because it uses a very brute force method for closing the
window.  It should especially not be used on the Buttons module, since
then the Buttons module cannot close it's swallowed windows correctly.
Pl 36 has fixes so FvwmButtons kills it's swallowed children more
cleanly more often now, but I haven't found a way to catch the Destroy
action yet.

I was thinking about modifying Destroy to try a Close action first,
and then the more brute force method if that didn't work.  Perhaps
I'll investigate this a little more...

Make it a separate function. There are times when you want to - or must -
do a destroy (e.g. application hung).

Since we are discussing options/improvements to FVWM. . .

is their currently, or i there a way to get the FvwmButtons bar to swallow
an Xapp that was started previous to fvwm?  I currently use a program called
xsession to allow me to switch between window managers and to log console
output.  Is there a way that I can swallow the xsession program into
FvwmButtons?  

I think this would improve my desktop arrangement greatly.  

Thanks,

-Alan

I built pl36 today, and had two SEGV's in the last couple hours. So
I've gone back to pl35 for now.

I'm not exactly sure what is triggering the problem. Here's the
contents of my xsessionlog:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14975 Segmentation Fault - core dumped
X connection to hpx06:0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the X terminal reports a fatal I/O error (broken pipe) or
somesuch.

The only modules I use are FvwmPager and FvwmButtons. Were any changes
made in these w.r.t. pl35? Is it possible for a module to cause fvwm
to crash, or is the problem necessarily in fvwm itself?

At the time of the crash, a new window was attempting to be
created. I compiled with SUNWspro cc and -O under Solaris-2.3.

I know, not much help. I'll try to provide more info when I have some
free time over the weekend.

Hi,

1) I prefer a shorter filename like: fvwm-2.0b-pl36.tar.gz
2) Trying to compile it under UnixWare 2.0 and got the below warnings
   wherever MWMBorders is referenced:
UX:acomp: WARNING: "borders.c", line ... : integer overflow detected: op "<<"

   I changed fvwm.h from:
#define MWMBorders              (1<<31)
   to
#define MWMBorders              ((unsigned int)1<<31)

to get rig of the warmings.

3) gethostbyname is used by FvwmCpp and FvwmM4. The Imakefiles however
   do not have -lsocket defined. So I added:
LOCAL_LIBRARIES = $(XLIB) -L../../libs -lfvwmlib     -lsocket

4) FvwmButtons.c: line 459 (return;). Would this statement ever be reachable ?
5) FvwmGrabWindow.c: line 631 (return;). Would this statement ever be reachable ?
6) FvwmTalk/FvwmTalk.c: line 446: changed
                              &nitems, &bytes_aft
   to:
            (unsigned long *) &nitems, (unsigned long *) &bytes_aft

Now, if we could remove the 'return' from 4) and 5). Then I have 100% clean
compilation. That is NO WARNINGS.

It sounds like a good idea, but there is no way to do this currently.
I'll add it to the TO-DO list though, along with the ability to
'unswallow' windows (at will or possibly at shutdown time w/ an
option) instead of killing the clients.

I made a change to FvwmButtons to prevent it from doing nasty things

there, but that's about it.

I don't think that a module can really crash fvwm, since they only do
socket communication and are actually to separate processes.  But
module communication could trigger a bug in fvwm.

It was created by a third-party aplication I've used dozens of times
before with fvwm with no problem. I don't think there is anything
special about it, but xprop/xwininfo info follows nonetheless:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ xprop

No, it was something else. The only thing FvwmButtons swallows is
rclock, like so:

*FvwmButtons(2x2) - whatsit Swallow "Clock" Exec rclock -bg RosyBrown -geometry -1500-1500 -font -*-times-*-r-*-*-17-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -mailupdate 10 &

There is a chance that the window obscured the swallowed rclock
button, and FvwmButtons may have been trying to re-draw it. I'm not
sure.

Well, I haven't tried it again, but I just noticed it left a core file
in my home directory (ordinarily these are suppressed by my shell via
`limit core 0', but I guess if the error happens within an xsession
the shell is not involved. Lucky me.)

Anyway, here it is -- it wasn't compiled with w/ debug, but there may
be a grain of clue somewhere:

I was thinking more that if the window showed up on another screen,
the WM would switch to this screen.  Maybe for REALLY crowded
desktops, there could be an option for an amount of time to wait after
switching before the window actually appears.

Daniel Schepler                         The distinguishing mark of an

How hard would it be to add mouse chording to fvwm? by this I mean, say,
pressing button 3 in the title bar of a window, then clicking button 2
gives you a different function to clicking and releasing just button 3
or just button 2.

As far as syntax goes, just extending the modifiers to include '1', '2',
and '3' would work, I think. 

Thanks,
Anthony

Another thing for the TODO list would be an even SmarterPlacement option
which would (if the usual SmartPlacement failed), try to place the
window so that it doesn't overlap the TOPMOST window ...

... even better might be to have it avoid overlapping as many of the
windows as possible using the current stacking order as a priority.

It's often annoyed me that just because I have some iconified windows
lying around (at the bottom of the stacking order), FVWM decides that it
can't do a smart placement on a new, small window.

This gets especially annoying with a program like "xanim" which has a
control panel window that, if "randomly" placed ends up right on top of
the graphics window rather than next to it.


Anyway, Chuck, you seem to be doing a great job fiddling with all of
this stuff!  Where do you find the time?

Hi fvwm user's

I just compile fvwm-2.0-pl36 on my SS20-Solaris 2.4. Is there a bug in fvwm or
module? When i start a module all work fine, but when the module finish it's
job (FvwmBanner, FvwmIdentify .....) fvwm crash with the message:

FVWM has been killed by a signal 11.
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800003
  Serial number of failed request:  878
  Current serial number in output stream:  879

What's happen???

I would just add 3 remark's about the new distribution.

1/ Add depend in the lib directory for 'make depend' work corectly.

2/ Add FVWM_MAN_DIR in the Imakefile of all modules and xpmroot for 'make
install.man' with FVWM_MAN_DIR MANDIR=/usr/local/man/mann work corectly.

3/ And finaly add a switch in the Imakefile to choose between /bin/sh or
/bin/csh in the file 'builtin.c' for the execvl function. This is to make fvwm
launch application with /bin/csh rather than /bin/sh

All other work's fine to me.

Olivier.

Thanks.  Later, I have realized this BUGS file.  But what's bad is, is
that also Close makes fvwm hang (at least for me).  Also, is not
possible to choose the Banner module from the menu: the banner--actually
this little linux guy--pops up, but then the banner disappears and a
black box remains on the top of the screen.

	Hi,
content-length: 823

1) In fvwm 1.xx there was a function (StubbornPlacement I think) that
allows fvwm to place a window which otherwise places itself at 0,0. Is
there any way to do that with fvwm 2.0 ?

2) Many of my users have only one desktop with 4 pages and use
FvwmButtons with a swallowed Pager.  Is it possible to start a
swallowed iconic Pager or to suppress the title of the desktop to allow
a Pager a bit larger ?

3) Sometimes, as everybody I think, I begin to strike some keys with
the cursor in the background. For that, I added lot of lines in .fvwmrc

Key	A	R	A	 Beep
Key	B	R	A	 Beep
Key	C	R	A	 Beep
Key	D	R	A	 Beep
	.
	.
	.
Is there a more simple way to do that ?

Hello all.

With the following system:
AMD 486 DX4100 with 20Mb RAM and Tseng ET4000W32i running
Linux 1.2.11 with XFree86 3.1.1 

I have observed a problem with fvwm pre 2.0 pl 33 and pl 34, which do
not occur with fvwm 1.24 and twm.

With some programs e.g. Radiance (a ray tracer) whenever a window in
which the process is running is killed -- either by double clicking
on the "close button" or by giving the process a kill -kill 
X hangs -- or more to the point fvwm hangs.

I think I have isolated the problem to 4 lines of code in the file
misc.c in the fvwm directory.

line 185 to line 188 in fvwm/misc.c:

  if (Tmp_win->class.res_name && Tmp_win->class.res_name != NoName)
    XFree ((char *)Tmp_win->class.res_name);
  if (Tmp_win->class.res_class && Tmp_win->class.res_class != NoName)
    XFree ((char *)Tmp_win->class.res_class);

A printf reveals that 

Tmp_win->class.res_name  is "NoName"
Tmp_win->class.res_calss is "NoClass"
NoName                   is "Untitled"

So it looks like fvwm tries to free something that is not "freeable"

I think that the problem lies in add_window.c line 129 to 135:

 tmp_win->class = NoClass;

 XGetClassHint(dpy, tmp_win->w, &tmp_win->class);
 if (tmp_win->class.res_name == NULL)      <----+
     tmp_win->class.res_name = NoName;          | 
 if (tmp_win->class.res_class == NULL)     <----+
     tmp_win->class.res_class = NoName;         |
                                                |
                              here is tmp_win->class.res_name "NoName" and
			      tmp_win->class.res_class is "NoClass".


The same or a related problem have been reported in pl 36 by Karl Eichwalder.

Yesterday I accidently send this message to fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu
Sorry!

I tried fvwm2.0-pl36 and compiled it on Linux 1.3.20. (gcc-2.6.3)
With the system.fvwmrc it seems to work fine. However, using my own
.fvwmrc, fvwm hangs and all I can do is move the mouse.
pl33 works fine with this .fvwmrc (I am now using it). pl34 didn't work,
pl35 did not hang but some windows (TECPLOT) did not have an icon in the
FvwmIconBox.

In my .fvwmrc I use xload, xbiff, rclock, FvwmPager and FvwmIconBox
'swallowed' in my FvwmButtons module. I think that's causing the trouble.

My suggestion for fvwm2.0 is that the icons in FvwmIconBox do also highlight
if you are working in the corresponding window (just like in FvwmPager).

I don't know how hard it would be, but it sounds interesting.  I'll
add it to the TO-DO list.

Really?  I've used the following all along with no problems:

AddToMenu Quit-Verify   "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title

I believe that the restart code does have some small bugs though.
I'll see what I can find.

Thanks.

Actually, I don't really have a lot of time to work on it normally.  I
answer notes & fiddle when I can: at lunchtime, at home late at night
& weekends, quick spurts between things at work, etc.  People sending
me patches helps too.

There will be times when I won't be able to do anything for lengths of
time...  But I'm glad that people seem to be happy for now.

This SEGV occurs in AddWindow(), and appears to be related to this
change:

pl 35 to 36
       6. Reverting NoClass patch completely, as I think it's causing
          other problems

Perhaps it wasn't backed out completely?

Also, I hadn't noticed the other problems present in pl35. Can you
elaborate please?

Ah!  I remember now...  That is correct - I hadn't finished backing it
all the way out and got sidetracked by something else.  I'm finishing
it up right now, and I'll hopefully have a patch for you shortly.

mb> Also, I hadn't noticed the other problems present in pl35. Can you
mb> elaborate please?

I don't remember exactly what "other problems" was concerned about at
the time.  Sorry.  But it did mess up the way the FvwmIconBox worked,
and potentially other modules (window list?), so that was the primary
motivator for attempting to back it out.  BTW - Rob hadn't tested it
at all when it was given to him, he just included it and he told me
that when he gave me pl34.

Also, I'm not certain what the advantage of not re-naming or
re-classing no name & no class windows is while I can see advantages
to giving them a name/class that shows that they didn't have one
originally.

Would it be possible to re-structure the resize function so that if one
of the parameters is "special" ie 0 or -1 that resize will not modify
that dimension?

So that something like

Resize 0 100

would not modify the width of the window, but make the window 100
percent of the screen length?  Kinda like the Maximize function.

It's possible that this already exists but it's not documented in the
manpage, and I don't have access to my sources right now.

Should I be able to specify both percentage of window, and pixel width
in the same resize command?

I tried to do something like

Resize 492p 99

And the buttons I put this type of a command on would attempt to do a
resize via the mouse.

In case you're wondering 492p is 80 columns for an xterm on a
1280x1024 screen.

Hi!

I have been running FVWM on all (UN*X) machines I have ever worked
on (HP, SGI, SUN, Linux) and it has always been the best window
manager I know of.

A few days ago I switched to a SGI with a 1280x1024 display. (the
graphics board is a GR2-Elan).

On this machine FVWM crashes every time that I log in:  Everything
starts up as usual, but after I have moved the mouse around the
screen for a short time, everything that is related with the
window manager just freezes.  Using cut&paste with the mouse I
can kill and restart FVWM.  Usually it works without any problems
after I have killed and restarted it once.  On some occasions I
had to repeat this process several times.

This is really strange, and I have no explanation for it.  I even
recompiled FVWM on *this* machine, but no luck.

If it is of any help, I have included the output of FvwmDebug 
(started from .fvwmrc) and my .fvwmrc at the end of this mailing.
(gzipped and uuencoded).

I would really appreciate help.  Even a simple work around would
help me a lot!

Thanks a lot in advance,
 Andy.

Hello,

  I just recently upgraded to fvwm2.  I am as pleased with the improvement
over fvwm as I was with fvwm over mwm.  It's just amazing!

  Most things from the fvwm config file mapped over nicely to the fvwm2,
albeit they became Style parameters as opposed to standalone commands.
One thing which has apparently disappeared though is OpaqueResize.  I
cannot find the equivalent to this.  Did it disappear?  This particular
command would be an excellent thing to do on a window-by-window basis
(there are only a few things I want to resize "opaquely", so if this
were a new Style command somehow, I would be very pleased.

  Also Chuck, awhile back I reported my wish to not have the click of the
mouse which brings the window into focus (I use ClickToFocus on most
windows) be passed through to the window itself.  You mentioned that it
would be an easy fix and even supplied a patch I believe.  Did this ever
make it into the production code?

  Lastly, according to the pl35 man page, there is an undocumented
option that I am curious about: SkipMapping/ShowMapping.  What's this?

  Thanks,

    ...Lance

I'd like to second very much the idea of SmartPlacement putting new
windows in other parts of the desktop if there's no room in the
current one, and maybe switching to it. This is presently my biggest
annoyance: almost any time I open a new window I have to manually
change to an empty part of the desktop.

OpaqueResize is gone.  It was an interesting feature, but needed a
really good X server & hardware to be used.  It might resurface, who
knows?  I can put it on the TO-DO list, if people really want to see
it back.

Sort of - it's commented out right now.  I will bring it to life after
I go through the gruelling task of 'fixing' the way that window
attribute flags are handled to allow more than 32 Style commands,
which I have some good ideas for and is the first thing I plan to do
after getting the first official release of 2.xx out to the world
(soon).  For now, you can compile it in yourself -> around line 927 of
events.c there is a '#if 1' -> just change that to a 0.

You know, I just looked through all the source code, and it's not used
anywhere.  That must have been something that Rob was going to
implement, but never did, or was implemented and then later removed.
I don't know what it was supposed to be.  I'll ask Rob.

I sure miss it. It's easy to get used to on a standalone X box, and was
quite fast on my 486/80 with an old ATI gup.


On another track, has anyone using click-focus found that occasionally
when you click on any window border to move or resize it, the window
"sticks" to the mouse? I've had this happen about once every 2 days, but
I can't reproduce it reliably.

I finally got around to switching my linux machine to shadow passwords,
so I needed a new version of xlock. I grabbed xlockmore 3.3, which has
some very cool new modes, but swirl is back to not color cycling. Can
anyone suggest a way around this, or tell me where to find an xlock that
does shadow passwords and works with fvwm?

This is not a "bug of resize", but a "bug or feature of
two-digit-argument-command", I think.

holder> Should I be able to specify both percentage of window, and
holder> pixel width in the same resize command?

You can try

	Resize 492p 99%

instead of

holder> Resize 492p 99

In fact, the character '%' has no meaning, but should not be 'p'. So,

	Resize 492p 99q

makes the same effect. But I think '%' character is the best character
to specify 'this number is the percentage of display width/height' :-)

If you wonder why, take a source of fvwm-2 and see GetTwoArguments()
in misc.c.

I suppose SkipMapping/ShowMapping feature is:

	Assume window 'X' is specified as 'ShowMapping', currently
	fvwm shows 'desktop 0' to display, and window 'X' is intended
	to come up to 'desktop 1' by using 'StartsOnDesk' or whatever.

	When I wakeup 'X', fvwm changes desktop to 'desktop 1'. Yes,
	this is the current behavior of fvwm.

	But if window 'X' is specified as 'SkipMapping', fvwm does not
	change desktop (i.e., still shows 'desktop 0'), but window 'X'
	appears to 'desktop 1' (of course it doesn't see to display).

Wow! it's an interesting feature. Anyone implements ? Specification is
clearly defined :-)

Apologies for this resent but i have trouble with my email

This the original message:

Hi fvwm user's

I just compile fvwm-2.0-pl36 on my SS20-Solaris 2.4. Is there a bug in fvwm or
module? When i start a module all work fine, but when the module finish it's
job (FvwmBanner, FvwmIdentify .....) fvwm crash with the message:

FVWM has been killed by a signal 11.
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800003
  Serial number of failed request:  878
  Current serial number in output stream:  879

I read the file BUGS in the distribution, however if you kill (i.e
FvwmIdentify) with the close window menu, the module close correctly, but when
you click in the root window to display the menu, fvwm crash in the same manner
(got  signel 11).

What's happen???

I would just add 3 remark's about the new distribution.

1/ Add depend in the lib directory for 'make depend' work corectly.

2/ Add FVWM_MAN_DIR in the Imakefile of all modules and xpmroot for 'make
install.man' with FVWM_MAN_DIR MANDIR=/usr/local/man/mann work corectly.

3/ And finaly add a switch in the Imakefile to choose between /bin/sh or
/bin/csh in the file 'builtin.c' for the execvl function. This is to make fvwm
launch application with /bin/csh rather than /bin/sh

All other work's fine to me

Olivier.

Hello,

----- Forwarded message from matusita@ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp -----
I suppose SkipMapping/ShowMapping feature is:
	[...]
	But if window 'X' is specified as 'SkipMapping', fvwm does not
	change desktop (i.e., still shows 'desktop 0'), but window 'X'
	appears to 'desktop 1' (of course it doesn't see to display).

Wow! it's an interesting feature. Anyone implements ? Specification is
clearly defined :-)
----- End of forwarded message from matusita@ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp -----

It's there today! And it works! I use this feature to start Mosaic (which on
my machine loads _very_ slowly) on desk 2. I don't want fvwm to switch to
desk 2, though, because I can see on the pager when Mosaic has finally
loaded. I use the same feature to start Elm on desk 1 at startup (without
having to say "Wait Elm"

I specified this behavior it like this:

Style "Mosaic"      Icon Mosaic.xpm, StartsOnDesk 2, SkipMapping
Style "Mail:*"      Icon makeenvelope.xpm, StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping

AddToFunc InitFunction 	  "I" Module FvwmButtons
+			  "I" Module FvwmPager 0 2
+                         "I" Exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -name Elm -geometry 100x50+350+280 -T Mail:USER{@}CLIENTHOST -e elm &
+                         "I" Exec /usr/bin/X11/x97801 -cr grey60 -name tcsh -geometry +180+150 -sb -e tcsh -l &

and it works in pl30...pl35, at least.

  Actually it works really well on some applications (and is very useful
as well).  I'm thinking of things like text editors where, for example,
you have long lines and you want to make the window JUST big enough
without having to make it too big first and then shrink it back down.
And I don't consider my hardware especially high-end (it is good though)
but OpaqueResize worked quite well on it.

  If added as a Style option (if possible) then that would be really
ideal since I could easily limit it to those applications where it made
sense.

  Thanks!

    ...Lance

I've just had a look at xcuckoo, and I think it would be a great idea if
fvwm could swallow applications in its title bars, and generally allow
more formatting of the title bars.
For instance, you could have formatting of the title, left, centred and
right justified. I currently use 2 Fvwmbutton modules and I think that
if the title button could do more, then I could get rid of one of them.
Perhaps the title bar could be controled by a module, however I am not
an experienced X programmer, so I don't have a clue as to how do this. 

Does anyone else think that this would be a good idea?

Also I think that the quit option should allow a yes/no choice. I've
used Quitverify for a while now(FvwmForm module) but it seems painfully
slow. I've seen olwm logout and it it about 10 to 20 times faster than
Fvwm's as it is almost instantanious. I reckon that the quit proceedure
is too important to be put in a module and so it should be in the main
code, perhaps as an option to the quit command. 

Does anyone have opinions about this?

Graeme

The show/skip mapping option gets set as the flag SHOW_MAPPING in style.c

This gets copied over into the flag in the FvwmWindow structure, and renamed
to SHOW_ON_MAPPING in add_window.c (look for ALL_COMMON_FLAGS). It is used
to cause/prevent the window manager to change to the desktop of a new window
that is mapping for the first time.

Ok, I got more than enough notes from people who want it back.  After
I fix the Style flags to allow more than 32, I'll make sure it gets
brought back.

I know about this, and see it quite often.  I believe it has to do
with Motion being done with a timeout instead of a MotionThreshold
value.  If a window takes a long time to refresh while raising, fvwm
thinks it was actually a Motion instead of a Click, and tries to move
or resize the window.  I already plan to make Motion work off of a
MotionThreshold variable instead sometime in the near future (after
the first official release).

Like OpaqueMove, this has as much to do with the windows UNDERNEATH the 
window you're resizing as it does with the window that you're actually 
resizing. They must keep redrawing themselves too.

I have never found a machine where OpaqueResize was acceptable. It always 
caused a lot of annoying flickering. This was mostly tested on Sparc-10's.

You're right about the definition of the function. I believe that it has

I'll add Matushita-san's description to the man page, if it's not
already in there (I didn't see it, but I might have messed up my grep
there too...)

I screwed up in removing the NoClass patch.  I have it fixed and will

I haven't figured out how to do that yet, but as soon as I do I will.

I'm waiting for a patch that was volunteered to clean up the
Imake/configure.h stuff.  That's why I'm holding off on releasing pl37
for the moment.  It will be fixed before the official release, but
hopefully it'll be fixed for pl37.

Hhhmmm.  I don't know about this one.  Using /bin/sh is a pretty
standard way to launch apps.  I don't think I'd want to add the
confusion of making that an option and having to document it
everwhere.  Plus, individual users might not know which one theirs was
compiled with if they didn't compile it.

Ah, Ok, that would explain why I didn't find SHOW_MAPPING anywhere

I've got title justification on the TO-DO list.  Someone submitted a
patch for 1.24r that I've been saving to merge into 2.xx sometime.

As for the idea of the title bar swallowing apps, I'm not sure about
the general usefulness of that.  Perhaps in this specific instance it
makes sense, but what else could it be used for?

I assume that xcuckoo puts the time somewhere.  Perhaps just a simple
FvwmClock module that merges the time into the highlighted window's
title bar would be better (if possible currently).

Graeme> Does anyone else think that this would be a good idea?

I think that the title bars really have to be controlled by fvwm, but
modules should be able to play with them a little.  If a module could
get the id for the titlebar window, it could do whatever it wanted to
the title bar I imagine (including making it swallow an application).
I'm not sure how 'safe' it would be to do though (i.e. conflicts with
what fvwm would be trying to do to the titlebar).

And if a module could get the window id's for the titlebar and the
buttons, then it could do things like animate the buttons (ala ctwm).
An interesting feature that I'd much rather see in a module instead of
wasting space in fvwm, if it were to appear.  The modules don't
currently get the window ids for the titlebar or buttons, but that
could be added, I imagine.

Graeme> Does anyone have opinions about this?

As you can probably tell from my other comments (in this and other
notes), I'd really like to keep as much in modules as possible, so I
think that FvwmForm is better for doing that than adding the code to
fvwm to do so.

Granted, for this example it probably wouldn't be a lot of code added
to fvwm, but that excuse could be used for a lot of things.  Modules
are an excellent way to avoid creeping featurism and turning fvwm into
a bloated evil entity like mwm and dtwm.

FvwmForm is well suited for things like this, so I say let it do it's
job.  I just ran it, and it took a second or two to come up, which is
very noticeable but it wasn't unbearable.  On your machine, perhaps
it's longer.

Can someone tell me the major differences between the fvwm1.24 and
the upcoming fvwm2.0? I got the fvwm2.0 from sunsite and compiled on
my Linux system and got errors. fvwm1.24 got a clean compile. what
are the major differences between these two versions? Is it look and
feel or better memory usage?

Thank you.

Hello

I use fvwm-pre-2.0-pl35. On a window's left button (button 0), I have bound
the usual menu (mwm-style). But the menu doesn't fit "snug" attached to the
title bar, but leaves a one-pixel row to the left and top free; the original
window contents are visible in this area. I think it would look "more
professional" (or rather "more mwm-ish") if the menu would attach directly
to the title bar (and left resize bar, respectively).

    Martin
__
Here's my config:

    Mouse 0 1       A       Menu    Window-Corner   Close

with the menu

    AddToMenu Window-Corner "Restore        Alt+F5"         Nop
    +                       "&Move          Alt+F7"         Move-or-Raise
    +                       "&Size          Alt+F8"         Resize-or-Raise
    +                       "&Lower         Alt+F3"         Lower
    +                       "Raise"                         Raise
    ....
and
    # Keyboard accelerators
    Key F3          A       M       Lower
    Key F4          A       M       Destroy
    ...
    Key F10         A       M       Maximize

This menu pops up, but it is one pixel too far down, that is:

   ++===++=======================++===++===++
   || = ||        Title          || * ||[ ]||
   ++===++=======================++===++===++

I have discovered a bug in fvwm 2.0 pl36 - previously notified to Chuck,
but now I have tracked it down and corrected it.


The symptoms are that closing certain windows causes fvwm to crash - on 
Solaris 2.4 it dies, on Linux 1.3/XFree 3.1.1 it goes into a cpu-munching
loop.  The easiest way to demonstrate the bug is to use the Rlogin
module, described in the FvwmForm manual page - on pressing the Login or
Cancel buttons, or attempting to close the window from the frame, fvwm
hangs.

I'm not sure quite what types of windows cause the trouble, but most of the
"normal" ones, such as xterms, emacs, etc, work fine - hence it slipping through
the net, I presume.

The problem seems to be related to the NoClass change (whatever that is!);
the following patch fixes it:

diff fvwm/add_window.c fvwm/add_window.c_orig 
130c130
< #if 1
---
> #if 0
136c136
< #if 0

> #if 1

diff fvwm/misc.c fvwm/misc.c_orig

That patch will alleviate the problem until pl37 comes out.  pl37 has
this problem fixed.  Hopefully I'll get it out later today.

A long while ago (1.* days) I suggested this feature, but I forget how 
the response was. It's a *cough* mac System 7.5 feature that I thought 
was really neat, instead of iconfiying the window, you just hide the 
window but leave the titlebar, like a, well, Window Shade. 

Seems like all the code is already in place (seems to me, anyways), 
instead of hiding all the wm stuffs, leave the titlebar there. 

I'm not sure if anyone else appreciates this feature, but sometimes icons 
are just so impractical and small.

Umm.. sorry for misunderstanding. Now I see pre2.0pl36 source again,
and confirm that ShowMapping/SkipMapping is already defined.

I recall this request.  I think it sounds interesting, so I'll add it
to my TO-DO list.  I wonder if this could be done as a module (which
is how I'd prefer it to be implemented)?  Perhaps after some of the
additional module communication information that I mentioned in an
earlier note (sending titlebar window ids) is added.

Subject: 	FVWM: feature request of old: WindowShade

A long while ago (1.* days) I suggested this feature, but I forget how 
the response was. It's a *cough* mac System 7.5 feature that I thought 
was really neat, instead of iconfiying the window, you just hide the 
window but leave the titlebar, like a, well, Window Shade. 

Seems like all the code is already in place (seems to me, anyways), 
instead of hiding all the wm stuffs, leave the titlebar there. 

I believe *twm do this, so it should be trivial.

I like this idea!

A quick bug report: The titles in the title bars of the windows do not
change ever.  For example, XEmacs prints in the title the name of the
buffer you are editing.  This doesn't change, unless you restart fvwm.

Best regards,

P.S. Here's a picture of my hacked up fvwm -- I want to generalize the

You must be using pl34.  Pick up pl37, available shortly.

I like the idea of the Pixmaps for buttons, but Xpm's (and general

Will your patches use a TitleStyle type setup that would control

:) My rationale is that above all, I'd like consistency.  I don't want
to have completely different look and feel every time I reboot between
Win95 and Linux.  And I happen to find the Win95 window manager
aesthetically pleasing (and of course completely brain-dead compared
to fvwm :)

I will do everything as generally as I can, so just like you can
specify MenuStyle of fvwm or Motif, I would add Win95.  I have an
additional ButtonStyle called Icon, which simply scales the window's
icon down to fit in a titlebar button.

For the title-bar, I would expect something similar, as you mention
above.

Yup - in fact you'll see 2 copies of this.  People often reply to both

Howdy all!

Ok, pl37 is at ftp.hpc.uh.edu:

pl 36 to 37
       1. Fixed coredump due to incomplete backout of NoName/NoClass patch
       2. Fix for multiple env var expansion core dump from Sverre H. Huseby
       3. Small doc fixes (spelling, etc)
       4. Imakefile/configure.h enhancements from Randall S. Winchester
       5. Updated system.fvwmrc (FvwmIconBox changes from Nobutaka Suzuki)

If there aren't any big things wrong with it now, which I really hope
there aren't, I imagine that the next release will be the first official
one.  Since everyone is already referring to the current one as 2.0, I
think the first official release will be called 2.1.  Also, I'd like
to go to the following scheme for versions:

                          FVWM Version M.I.P

Where M is the Major version number (HUGE changes)
      I is the Minor version number (Significant changes)
      P is the patchlevel           (Patches/Small changes)

So the first release will be 2.1.0.

Or should we stick with the letter convention from 1.xx?  I suppose it
doesn't matter, eh?

This is the typical "me too" mail.  If this feature would be added
to fvwm 2.x, it would be _THE_ reason to upgrade from 1.24r which
works otherwise fine for me.

This particular idea came up in one of the linux groups, and I thought
I'd post it over here as I think as a general mechanism it could be
useful. It comes from a discussion on configuring fvwm to work as
closely as W95 for those who like that interface.

One feaure someone liked that can't be reporduced is the behaviour of
alt-tab in windows. Sure, we can assign circulate up and circulate down
to different keys, but the fast toggling to the last used window with
the same key press is kind of handy, and I could think of other uses for
a mapping that worked the way alt tab does. If you're not familiar with
this function, holding down the alt key down and repeatedly hitting tab
brings up first the last window used, and then the second last, etc,
circulating back to the original window again. Because alt tab is more
easily reached from the home row than the function keys, it's a feature
that can grow on you, and because it acts as a toggle between the last
two windows it's very convienient.

The toggle between two actions with the same key press could also be
used for other functions other than imitating windows which might be
useful as well, such as jumping between desktops.

makes the same effect. But I think '%' character is the best character
to specify 'this number is the percentage of display width/height' :-)


As YAFS, does anyone else wish that you could specify lines and columns
for windows with text in them? I know fvwm must know the difference
because it reports the numbers differently when you resize by hand. I'd
like to be able to set a button to toggle between a 24 line and 48 line
window without having to try to guess how many pixels that is.

AGH!  Please dont mess with this one - I use it all of the time!
Basically it is a style that allows you selectively turn on/off
switching desktops when a window is being mapped.

For instance, I have two desktops:  Main and Mail.  When I start fvwm,
an xtermand some other stuff it started on Main.  On Mail, I start
emacs and exmh.  I have the SkipMapping style set for emacs and exmh
so when they start, fvwm doesnt jump to the Mail desktop and then back
to the Main desktop.  It makes them start up "in the background".  I
thought the jumping back and forth when windows are being mapped is
real ugly.

Here is the style line for my exmh and emacs:

Style "?macs"       Icon gnu-animal.xpm, StartsOnDesk 1, NoButton 2,
  SkipMapping
Style "?xmh"        Icon mail1.xpm, StartsOnDesk 1, NoButton 2, SkipMapping

Here is an excerpt from two messages from Rob Nation (2nd and 3rd of
August) on this issue:

>You need to set the SHOW_ON_MAP flag which exists in fvwm. There seems to

and...

Hope this helps.

Hi!

For future releases of FVWM I suggest also putting patch/diff-files on the
ftp-archive. It's cheaper for people with slow internet access.

I also like the idea of the M.I.P numbering scheme.

Why is FVWMDIR in pl37 set to /usr/local/X11R6...?

It tells me that I need a file called xpm.h, which I can't find on my 
system.  It is looking for it in X11/ which is a symbolic link to X11R6 
on my  system.  Could you email me the header file and I can install it then?
Thank you for your time, and for a wonderful product...

I've been changing the colours on my Xwindows setup using .fvwmrc and
.Xresources but I haven't been able to find the variable for the colour
of windows that are in the backgroud (i.e. the equivalent of HiForeColor
and HiBackColor for windows that are in the background). I also haven't
been able to fine the variable that changes the colour of the frame of a 
window when it is initially being placed. If you know the names of these 
variables I'd appreciate hearing from you.

Many Thanks

Hello Fellow FVWMers,

Compiling patchlevel 37: 
  The following additions need to be made to the makefile.

When compiling the modules/program: 
  FvwmPrompt, FvwmAudio and xpmroot
the linker chokes.  This is because on linking, there are no references
to the libraries:
  -lsocket and -lnsl
These need to be added to the makefiles for the above mentioned modules.
The other modules seem to have them.

System: Solaris 2.4

Cheerio 

Jon

Hello

I got hold of fvwm2 patch 34, and compiled it on the weekend and got
a clean compile, with only one exception.

I did

	xmkmf
	MakeMakefiles
( complained about Makefile for FvwmConfig )
	make all

I went and looked in the FvwmConfig module and found a makefile but
this module was not built and was not installed.

Now I got the patch 37 and FvwmConfig still has the same makefile.

problem #2
==========

The man pages have FvwmBanner.man
                             ^^^^^
How do I make the man utility read these pages.

problem #3
==========

Is there a better fvwmrc conversion program than the one that came
with patch 34?

Thank you.
Subbarao

  Kind of annoying.  Why does it have to be that way?  Other mailing lists
I've been on at least set the Reply-To: field to the mailing list so it's
easy to reply to the list.  I guess I'm not so concerned about getting
the two copies of mail (although it would be nice not to) as the fact that
I always have to remember and then type the address of the list in my
note (I guess I should set up a nickname).  Although when I do that, I
usually just change the To: tag so the person I'm "replying" to doesn't
get two copies.

  Although maybe I can see why that is.  Whenever I send a note to the list,
I always get a few bounced mail messages.  If it weren't for the lack of
the Reply-To, would the list get those messages and not be able to filter
them?

Before you release 2.0 (or 2.1 or whatever), I think it's time
FvwmForm was brought up to date and use the fvwmlib for reading the
config file.  Currently, I have to run FvwmM4 with the -debug switch
(so it saves the generated /tmp/fvwmrcXXXXXX file) in order to use
FvwmForm.  I've tried on several occasions and failed.  Since today is
a holiday for everyone but us, I'll give it another shot.  There may
be other modules in the same boat, but FvwmForm is the only one that
has a problem with it (if you also use FvwmM4 and presumably FvwmCpp).

I thought I already had something like this on my TO-DO list (simple
variables for .fvwmrc functions, for things like toggles), but
apparently I had forgot to put it on there.  It's on there now.

A good idea.  I'll see if I can remember to do that.

Because the individual whom I got the configure.h/Imakefile patches
from set that for his default, but I didn't catch it to change it back
to the slightly more standard default.  I will right now though.

Instead of making fvwm able to have a bazillion of user interface,
would it be possible to have modules that handle windows decoration
and menus ? If the inter-modules communication is not too slow, it
would allow to have a win95 module, a macOS module, a warp module or
whatever, and keeping fvwm core small. The current window decorations
and menus could be kept as default, but possibly overridden by some
module routines.

If it is feasible in terms of speed, I'd rather see that than a lot of
new functions.

It's funny you should bring this up.  I was wondering about that
myself.  I don't want to bloat fvwm, so any new things that come up
I've been suggesting be implemented in modules if at all possible.

I hadn't said anything about this specific instance, because I think
that the Pixmap buttons addition & the TitleStyle stuff need to be in
the main executable, but wasn't sure about the Win95 MenuStyle.

I'd prefer it (Win95 menus) as a module, but it would probably be too
slow.  Unless the module could be kept running constantly instead of
being run when needed...  Perhaps if modules could override built in
commands (ie Popup and Menu) to send messages to the already running
modules, then it might be fast enough.

Actually, there is a lot of code duplication in the modules that I
wanted to get cleaned up to use fvwmlib instead, and this falls into
that category as well.  I was going to wait until after the first
release, but perhaps I should do it before.

Correct - FvwmConfig doesn't have Imake support since it's written in
C++.  Perhaps I should put a note that it doesn't get built by default
in the README or INSTALL file.  There, I just did so for the next
release (INSTALL & BUGS).

That's what I had in mind. Launching a module each time would be to
expensive in terms of time. But sending a message to a module telling
'draw window number 12345' should be fast enough. I guess that new
messages should be added to fvwm to be able to handle this
mechanism. Then, those who want could design a GEM UI or a Apple Lisa
UI as they which :-)

Thank you for replying.

If FvwmConfig does not built by default, should I rename the "makefile" to
"Makefile" and compile(make) it? What is the fuction of FvwmConfig?

No problem.

Subbarao> If FvwmConfig does not built by default, should I rename the

You don't need to rename it.  The 'make' program looks for several
differently named files, in the following order:

         GNUmakefile makefile Makefile s.makefile s.Makefile

or you can just run make -f makefilename if the file was named
something else.  The first one is GNU make specific, and the last two
are used to grab makefiles from sccs.  The 2nd and 3rd are the most
commonly used.

Subbarao> What is the fuction of FvwmConfig?

I believe it does simple fvwm configuration.  There is a man page for
it.  Rob doesn't recommend using it (read the man page) as it doesn't
cover all of the fvwm configuration options.

I have compiled a small collection of colour xpm icons for use in
the fvwm (2.0) menus. If you are interrested, here they are, uuencoded,
tarred and gzip'ed. Their size are 14x14 pixels and they use the same 8
colours, all of them.
 It would be nice to get icons for even more applications, like xv and emacs,
in that small size. (I think)
Enjoy, if you want, and have a nice day, wherever you are.

Many mail readers (all that I have used) have two functions for

When I was thinking about writing a Start bar for fvwm (a la Win95's
start bar), I thought: `this has got to be a module'.  But then I
realized that it would primarily be using (a) Pixmaps from the icons,
and (b) Menus.  Using its own menu code would be wasteful, since 99%
of it would be identical with fvwm's menus, and I would hate for it to
have its own pixmaps, when they are in common with fvwm's (unless
somehow, fvwm told the module about the pixmaps).

I still think it should be a module, but I also think the issues
remain.  The counter argument is that the start bar is simply a type
of menu just like the pop-ups that exist in fvwm today.

As far as Menu styles, the MenuStyle Win95 was simply based on the
existing MenuStyle Motif, MenuStyle Fvwm.  I think that once a core
amount of functionality has been agreed on for fvwm (e.g. title bar &
title buttons, borders, pop-up menus, etc.), then these should be
customizable via Style directives.  If the code were written in an OO
programming language, this would be probably easier than it is today,
and it would allow for a cleaner separation of these styles
(i.e. class MacTitleBar : public TitleBar) (but this is just my
opinion :)

On another note, I'm wondering if many of you out there use Xnest for
debugging fvwm.  I've found it to be pretty useful when working on
fvwm.  For those who aren't acquainted with this program, it's an X-
Server-in-a-window.  You then invoke fvwm as `fvwm -display :1' and
you can test the window manager without fear of crashing your main X
Server or disrupting your session.

Best regards, 

-Elan

The code in fvwm/menu.c can be divided between

  1/ code that generates and destroys menus in memory;
  2/ code to display menus.

Obviously, only (a part of) 2/ has to be rewritten. If it is possible
for fvwm to pass a complete menu data structure to a module when it is
modified, then 1/ could be kept in fvwm/, along with some additionnal
communication code. If this is not possible, 1/ could be at least
moved to fvwmlib to avoid source duplication, if not code bloat (which
could be avoided with a shared library, but since libfvwm is so
small...)

Then the code of 2/ could be duplicated from fvwm/menus.c. The same
holds for drawing windows, since positionning the title and using
xpm's is not enough to emulate the look and feel of a window manager. 

Now, if we can come up with a relatively simple definition of menu
appearance that can be parameterized (for example, in terms of color
and shadow thickness for menus themselves, selected item, separators,
submenu arrows, etc.), then some general code could be written and an
UI would just be a set of parameters (Just have to do 'Read Win95Menus'
to enable it). Thus, no specific code would be hardcoded in fvwm for
these menus.

The start bar is also, if I am not mistaken, an icon manager that
shows all (iconified ?) applications. It could be programmed as such
(perhaps derived from FvwmIconBox) and call fvwm do displays
menus. Then, if you have a module that can display win95-like menus,
they will be shown as such. Of course, the same module could be both
an icon manager and an UI module.

Yes, but not every one want a large fvwm binary that can handle 45
different user interfaces. You like win95 look, but assume that
someone wants to add windows 2.0 or even twm ; the code will shortly
become very difficult to maintain. I think that the mwm style has some
reasons to be in the core, since mwm is typically a unix window
manager (except for Geos on PC, but this is a different
problem...). Moreover, fvwm tries to emulate mwm for Motif programs
that expect it to be there. The win95 style is more like an aesthetic
add-on (which I'd really like to see, in fact :-).

The example of Geos is not really innocent. In this OS, all the UI
stuff is located in a module (a geode, in geospeak). If you change this
module, the whole user interface is changed (not only the menus or
window decorations, but all dialogs, scrollbars, etc.). I have not
seen it myself, but a MacIntosh interface and a windows 2.0 interface
have been demonstrated for various versions of Geos.

If this is not too difficult in terms of coding and/or to slow, I'd
like to see fvwm take this direction. But, well, I don't really know C
or Xlib, so I won't do the coding myself. So I guess that people that
do the *real* work should be free to choose what they want to do :-)

How can I trap debug messages of fvwm? Should I redirect the output
from fvwm > to_a_file in my xinit or use FvwmDebug? I will be
compiling the fvwm2.1.37 tonight, so I want to trap the fvwm debug
messages or error messages to a file.

Thank you.

Hello, I have the Xpm library in a different location than normal.
All of the other Imakefiles worked great, but I had to add the
following to the modules/FvwmBanner/Imakefile:

EXTRA_INCLUDES = XPM_INCLUDES
EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES

Then all was content and happy :-)

I'm using pl37 now and it seems okay (i.e., it hasn't crashed yet), but I'm
having a problem with my Cm icon placement.

Actually, I've been having this since pl35. Cm is an xview calendar program. 
I call it as follows in my .xinitrc:  
   
   cm -i3 -fg `dark` -bg `light` -WP 85 0 &

The "-WP 85 0" is xview's icon_placement switch. It's supposed to place the
icon at +85+0. However, when Fvwm starts or restarts, the Cm icon is at
+0+0, which is where my console icon is. If I click on it once, it jumps to
the correct place. This problem never occured under Mwm.

It's not a big problem, but it is annoying.

I recommend using XSession to spawn fvwm if you want to capture it's
debug output.  It's very useful for that.

Also, keep in mind that FvwmDebug is not 100% updated for version 2.xx
and it's only showing messages to the modules (basically) anyways.

Hello, I have the Xpm library in a different location than normal.
All of the other Imakefiles worked great, but I had to add the
following to the modules/FvwmBanner/Imakefile:

EXTRA_INCLUDES = XPM_INCLUDES
EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES

Then all was content and happy :-)

thanks

Well actually the problem is due the use of EXTRA_LIBRARIES in those 
Makefiles. When I sent my last patches into Chuck, I tried to keep the 
previous usage of EXTRA_LIBRARIES intact. It in fact should never have 
been used inside the Imakefile, as that is what Imake wants to use for
system dependent libraries like -lsocket -lnsl. If you look at the 
Makefile you will see EXTRA_LIBRARIES defined twice. the first has the 
libs you are looking for. I have patches to send to Chuck to fix this as 
well as a few other things. Thanks for the prompt mail.

Hello Gail,

| I'm using pl37 now and it seems okay (i.e., it hasn't crashed yet), but I'm

I am also using pl37

| I call it as follows in my .xinitrc:  
|    cm -i3 -fg `dark` -bg `light` -WP 85 0 &
| icon at +85+0. However, when Fvwm starts or restarts, the Cm icon is at
| +0+0, which is where my console icon is. If I click on it once, it jumps to
| the correct place. This problem never occured under Mwm.

It doesn't seem to happen with me.  It sticks at 85 0.  When it starts up
it seems to start up at 0 0 and then jump to 85 0.  Restarting fvwm it
does the same, but it ends up at 85 0 as it should.

What version, what system, what OS?
(Mine is Solaris 2.4 on Sparcstation 5, CM version 3.4)

Ciao
Jon

Here is an excerpt from my .xinitrc file, which is complicated by the
fact that some people may be starting fvwm from .Xdefaults.  I have done
it both ways.


      # Start up the session manager and/or window manager.  First,
      # check if user is starting window manager separate from .Xdefaults.
      if test `egrep fvwm $HOME/.Xdefaults | egrep '^[^!]' | wc -l` = 0
      then
         /usr/local/bin/fvwm -f "FvwmM4 .fvwmrc" > $HOME/fvwm.log 2> $HOME/fvwm.log &
      fi
      if test -f /usr/bin/dxsession
      then
         /usr/bin/dxsession -geometry +0+0 > $HOME/dxsession.log 2> $HOME/dxsession.log &
      else
         echo "what system is this?"

Hello,

Anybody out there remember Warp Rings?  

I have been playing around with the Next and Prev (pathlevel 37),
trying to coax FVWM into allowing me to push a button
and have it move the cursor to the next window on the current
screen.  And of course, I want to move back as well.

However, the Next/Prev seem to move to the windows in
creation order.  I want it just to circulate between
those currently visible on my little portion of the virtual map.

Is this possible?  Has anybody got any ideas?  Of course, the Warp
Ring behaviour was even better.  (One could dynamically configure
which windows were to be in a ring, and then warp between them)

Thanks,
Jon

Here's how I get Next and Prev to move between only those windows on
the current page, and some other examples you may find useful:

# non-iconified windows on the current page of the current desk
Key Next A 2 Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
Key Prior A 2 Prev [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus

# non-iconified windows on the current desk
Key Next A 2M Next [!iconic CurrentDesk] Focus
Key Prior A 2M Prev [!iconic CurrentDesk] Focus

# non-iconified windows
Key Next A 2C Next [!iconic] Focus
Key Prior A 2C Prev [!iconic] Focus

# any window or icon on the current page of the current desk,
# including those otherwise skipped
Key Next A MC Next [CurrentScreen CurrentDesk CirculateHit] Focus
Key Prior A MC Prev [CurrentScreen CurrentDesk CirculateHit] Focus

# any window or icon on the current desk including those otherwise
# skipped
Key Next A 2MC Next [CurrentDesk CirculateHit] Focus
Key Prior A 2MC Prev [CurrentDesk CirculateHit] Focus

# any window or icon including those otherwise skipped
Key Next A MCS Next [CirculateHit *] Focus
Key Prior A MCS Prev [CirculateHit *] Focus

I agree that a warp ring is better, though there'd have to be some way
to set up the ring on the fly to make it worthwhile.  Just about
anything you could hardcode into a ring can be handled with the
current behavior of Next and Prev.

Thanks to whoever posted them for the mini-icons, but I can't get fvwm to
use them. I've tried them in several menus and they don't come up. Here's an
example:


AddToMenu Window-Ops	"Window Ops"			Title		
+			"Move%mini.move.xpm%"		Move-or-Raise2
+			"Resize%mini.resize.xpm%"	Resize-or-Raise2
+			"Raise%mini.raise.xpm%"		Raise
+			"Lower%mini.lower.xpm%"		Lower 
+		 	"(De)Iconify%mini.xpm%"		Iconify
+			"(Un)Stick%mini.excl.xpm%"	Stick		
+			"(Un)Maximize"			Maximize
+			""				Nop  
+			"Destroy%mini.bomb.xpm%"	Destroy
+			"Close%mini_blah.xpm%"		Close	 
+			""				Nop		
+			"Refresh Screen" Refresh		


I tried using asterisks and percent signs and the result is the same: no
icons in the menu.

Am I doing something wrong?

I've enabled 'OpaqueResize' in fvwm 1.24r for some weeks and I am
very pleased with the results.

BTW: My machine is a 90 MHz PCI bus Pentium PC with an ELSA Winner
2000 4MB graphics board running the Accelerated X server from Xinside
in 24 bpp tru color mode with 1152 x 990 resolution under SCO Unix.
I don't believe, that this kind of machine will be so much faster than
a Sun sparc-10 risc machine.  

IMHO the flickering (expose events handled by xterm, ghostview, etc)
are not annoying.  I'am guessing the effective frame rate is something
about 5-10 fps, which is pretty good enough.  Mosaic seems to be a
little bit slower, may be because of its Motif geometry management,
which has to recalculate a lot of widget positions.

I've noticed a problem with FrameMaker document windows which I believe is
related to fvwm.

My Frame windows are very big because they show a document page at 100%. 
Generally, Frame window geometry gets saved with the document, so that when
I open a document, it opens wherever I put it last. However, I find that with 
fvwm, the windows are coming up slightly too far down on the screen, making 
the bottom go off the bottom of the page. 

I've been experimenting. I put a window at +12 (from the top), save it, and
close it. When I reopen it, it is at +25.

Any ideas why this is happening?

Change it to look for -lfvwm2 instead.  I'll fix it here for the next
release.

I tried to use today the program xcol (presents the database of X
colors in a RGB cube), which worked perfectly undex fvwm sometime ago,
and was surprised to find that only the window title bar was SmartPlaced on
an empty slot of my secreen as expected, and the window content showed
at (0,0) ! 

Moreover, the following fvwm errors appear on the console:

fvwm: internal error
      Request 1, Error 2
      EventType: 20
fvwm: internal error
      Request 12, Error 2
      EventType: 20

Other than that, the program works.

This is using X11R6 on SunOS 4.1.3. I have to admit that I was running
X11R4 when I saw it work, so that might be the reason.

Well, no-window-name/no-icon-name/no-class patch which is applied to
pl34 is too buggy (I think this code is not tested:), and should go away
(But, I do not think this patch's policy is bad).

chuck_hines> pl 36 to 37
chuck_hines>        1. Fixed coredump due to incomplete backout of NoName/NoClass patch

I doubt this fixes is done:)

In HandlePropertyNotify(), code says:

      if (!XGetWMName(dpy, Tmp_win->w, &text_prop))
        return;
      free_window_names (Tmp_win, True, False);
      Tmp_win->name = (char *)text_prop.value;

In fact, XGetWMName() simply calls XGetTextProperty. Let us see
XGetTextProperty(3X) manuals.

	If the specified property does not exist on the window,
	XGetTextProperty sets the value field to NULL,...

So, text_prop.value may be NULL. In old ways, If property is NULL,
property turns to be NoName (yes, this is the internal constant value).
But now, it seems that fvwm allows to set Tmp_win->name to NULL. I
think this is the policy change of fvwm, and that's o.k.

But, free_window_names() does not consider this fact. see misc.c:

      if (tmp->name != tmp->icon_name && tmp->name != NoName)
        XFree (tmp->name);
      tmp->name = NULL;

WOW! we are going to XFree(NULL) :-)

I hope fvwm's iconname/windowname handling is fixed before 2.1 release.

***

If you, all the patch maker, want to release patch, please check your
code does not have a bug, or say "I have not tested" :-)

'allo folks,

  i used to subscribe to this mailing-list but have stopped temporarily.  so
please reply to me via email.

i have started using fvwm-1.2.4r under Solaris2.4 and my menus no longer seem
to be working.  i have not changed anything in my menus at all.  i have tried
explicit paths thinking it might be a path problem but that doesnt seem to
solve things either.  anyone have any ideas ??  these menus have worked under
sunos before.

here's some sample menu entries from .fvwmrc:

Actually, I've been seeing this problem in 2.0 all along (ever since pl13 or
so).  This problem didn't exist in 1.xx.

>From what I've seen, any window that starts up iconified and has a fixed icon
position (specified on the command line or in .Xdefaults) exhibits this
problem, even if an IconBox is defined for that window as a "Style" parameter.

For some reason, the icon tries to appear at 0,0 before jumping to its correct
position.  If there's another window open that's covering 0,0, the icon
appears under that window and never moves to its correct position until it is
uncovered.

I have several windows (cm, xterms, etc.) that I want to start up iconified at
particular positions on the desktop, so I see this a lot.  They all appear
at 0,0 and stay there until I uncover them by switching desktops or moving
the xterm that's covering 0,0.

I've worked around the problem in a kludgy way by defining for each item a
separate IconBox that's barely big enough to hold the icon.  I then remove the
command line parameters or X resources that set the icon position for those
icons.  The icons will then appear in the correct places.  Of course this
means that I have to tweak the start-up files for my other window managers the
same way, which is pretty gross.

The new fvwm2 I use has a call for xv in fvwmrc durinf init and
restart. Right now it does not come up because the directory its
looking for does not exist. I have not use xv until now. Does this
utility use bitmaps, gifs, jpeg etc files and paste them as your
wallpaper? If so are they in color?

The main question now is fvwm appears slow because the time it takes
to bring up the xv. If I restart fvwm without the call to xv, then
will the wallpaper disappear? Is xv continuously running in the
background and taking up memory?

Thank you.

1) FvwmButtons: Exec "" (don't "depress" the button) doesn't work.

Example:

*FvwmButtons Xv   none   Exec "" exec xv &

Produces a button, but when clicked on doesn't do anything but the message

/bin/sh: : cannot execute

Cause: the command line sent to sh starts w/ ""...

Patch (I think...)

2) A window w/ a "*" (or a "%") in its name is shown by the internal window
list as having a null name. The FvwmWinList module works correctly, but its
slowness and lack of usability puts it off...

Suggestion: (fvwm/menus.c, AddMenu f.) if a pixmap can't be found for a window
name including an escape character, maintain the initial string in the menu
entry. Sorry, don't have a patch, since AddMenu() & friends are truly
obfuscated code...

Keep on the good work, Chuck.

Possibly.  There are now way too many sites that send bounces to the
incorrect places.  Some send back to the list, some send to the original
sender of the message.  If you get bounces like that, let me know and I
will remove the offending addresses permanently.  If you are at one of
these sites (inmos or any site that uses Pegasus mail) then complain to
your admins about the low quality of their software.  I have no choice but
to have no mercy.

Also, in general if your address bounces once or your mail software sends
one incorrect bounce or error message then that address is removed
immediately.  I get hundreds of bounces a day and see no reason to put up
with it.

No, but another thing I've found is that if I plop a window (e.g. an
xterm) down, and then restart fvwm, every time I restart it the xterm
shrinks a tiny bit (perhaps a line of text every two of three
restarts).  The first time it happened I thought I was going crazy :)

I used fvwm-pre2.0-pl35.

I've just tried using the example, which uses percent, you sent ... and it
works.
I only put my pixmaps in the "PixmapPath" defined in the ".fvwm2rc" . By
default, it is in
"/usr/include/X11/pixmaps" directory.
Maybe you've forgotten this detail.

I am using fvwm pre2.0 patchlevel 37 on a DEC Alpha with OSF/1 3.0

I use the following to swallow my xconsole in my button bar:
*FvwmButtons(7x1) - whatever Swallow "xconsole" Exec xconsole &

When I initially start up fvwm, the xconsole is swallowed fine, but if I
restart I get a "cannot open console" error.  It turns out that at that
point there are two xconsoles trying to run.  One, which has "disappeared"
but is still listed as a process and the second which is displayed in the
button bar with the error message.  This worked fine with patchlevel 33. 

Thank you,

       The FVWM Homepage

Welcome to the FVWM Homepage!

FVWM is the X window manager developed once by Robert Nation and now Chuck Hines, based upon the code of twm
(developed by Thomas LaStrange). Fvwm provides virtual desktop support, a built in pager, SHAPED windows and icons,
the capability to use color icons with XPM support, and a module interface that is easy to modify and add functionality.
With a simple configuration interface, Fvwm can be modified to appear like a variety of different window managers or
have its own look-and-feel.

  Okay, that sounds good too.  I'll start forwarding the dead mail

> How can I, in xpaint, make a pixmap with no background so that fvwm uses
> its shape?

	Well, this is a rather convoluted way to do it, but I don't know
off the top of my head of any better way. 
	1. Create your pixmap, and set the background to all one color.
	   Save it as a pixmap, and then pull up the .xpm file in your
	   favorite editor. (don't worry, it is a text file)
	2. scroll down to the picture part (the top of the file is a list
	   of the colors and what character equals what color) and look
	   at it to determine what ascii character is your background color
	3. go to the top of the file, and find the character that is your
	   background character. change the two colors on the line to "none"

I've included a fragment of an xpm file below-- my "transparent" character
is the space " " and the line for it reads "  m none c none",
If your background character were "." then you'd make it ". m none c none",

/* XPM2 C */
static char ** nuke.xpm  = {
"32 32 11 1",
"   m none  c none",
".  m black  c #000000000000",
"X  m black  c #373837",
"                                ",
"              ........          ",
"          ....XXXXoooo..        ",
"       ..XXXXXXXXXXXXOOo.       ",

I hope that was reasonably clear.. if not, send me email and I'll try to
explain it a little bit better.

Dear all,

I have been trying to get the pager aassociated with a mouse button, but
am having problems doing this.  Is there something I have to be aware of
or is this simply not possible?

I have tried to do it in exactly the same way as WinList is implemented but
that didn't work, and then I tried declaring the Module Pager inside a Function
but it seems to me, this isn't necessary.  Apart from that it didn't work :(


Regards,
Jay

I found that you can use the program "pixmap" to reedit your bitmap
and paint over the background with the clear color button. Better yet just 
use pixmap to draw your icon. I'm not sure where to get it 'cause it
was already available on my system.

Chuck,

Since you said that, in the future, there will be a higher number of
possible styles, I'd like to make a suggestions. How about user-defined
styles? 

That is, right now, the only way to group styles is for "*" or common Class
or name strings. It would be nice if I could group them differently. For
example:

AddToStyle Info	NoHandles
+		NoTitle
+		Sticky
+		WindowListSkip
+		BorderWidth 0

I have this combination of styles on for several applications and it would
be cleaner to just say something like:

Style "Perfmeter" Info

Gail

oooh...i like this idea a lot!  right now, my .fvwmrc is *really* messy
down in the style section.  this would clean it up, make it more
readable, etc. etc.  i hope this makes it onto the to-do list.  btw,
keep up the great work, chuck!

I think it's a cooool feature, and is already proposed, while current 'Style'
is going to implement. But I don't know why this feature is not supported...

First, I would like to join the chorus of thanks to all those who 
spend time on the wm. It is really great, we all love it here.

The problem shows itself when I first log in when bringing up the first 
new window or two from my .xsession file. These windows sometimes do not 
have any of my styles; the color is some default light grey, and I have
no buttons in my menu bar.  All other windows (most of which are opened
by fvwm in some manor) are fine. Doing a restart fixes things, but 
I would like this not to happen. FYI fvwm is one of the first things 
started in my .xsession, and it is in the background. I use another 
gizmo for the last command in my .xsession.

I am running fvwm2 pl37 under several OS's. I see it from 
time to time under HP-UX 9.05, but it happens frequently
under Solaris 2.4. I built it with gcc, and 
I use the FvwmCpp module to preprocess my .fvwm2rc file.  

As long as I am on the subject, my $.02 about the 
config file is that I would not like to see fvwm depend on a 
copy dropped in /tmp for runtime. We run tmp cleaners
that wack old stuff, so if I am logged in for several days 
this file goes away. (I just seem to remember some rumor floating
about. Donno, maybe I am nuts.)

Can't this effect be achieved in 2.0 right now using FvwmCpp or
FvwmM4?

For example, wouldn't this:

	#define INFO NoHandles,Notitle,Sticky,WindowListSkip
	Style "Perfmeter" INFO

collected in a file (say .fvwm-styles) followed by

	FvwmCpp .fvwm-styles

in your .fvwmrc do what you're asking?

(I'm at home so can't test this myself right now, but the man page
seems to indicate it whould work this way).

I think the Style directive could be cleaned up some in other areas,
but this effect seems tailored to what FvwmCpp/FvwmM4 can already do.

This may be an old line, but it seems like things I write in X refuse to 
be put anywhere- it is as if it ignores the location WindowAttributes- 
However, Motif/Athena widgets stlil locate normally.  Has anyone had this 
problem, or have any idea how to get around it? (I do not have PPosition 
or what not set in my .fvwmrc).  The positioning DOES work in other 
window managers.

Why don't you just create an M4 macro that expands to

        NoHandles, NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0

call that `Info' and use it?

A suggestion for fvwm: since the installation directory of fvwm
modules is known at compile time, couldn't this be used as a default
value for ModulePath? It is is a small detail that would simplify fvwm
configuration, and in particular the use of the '-f' option of fvwm
(since the ModulePath would be known at initialization time).

Instead of starting them in .xsession, create an InitFunction in your
.fvwmrc and start them from there.  If you must put them in .xsession,
you'll have to use sleep to wait before running the apps to give fvwm
a chance to start up.

That's primarily a problem with fvwm 1.x.  In 2.x, that requirement
will go away once all the modules are rewritten to use the fvwmlib
interface for reading the configuration.  In fact, under 2.x I don't
believe the /tmp/fwmrcXXXXX file is saved at all unless you use FvwmM4
and turn on the debug switch so modules such as FvwmForm will work.

Fvwm will and does correctly use the PPosition hint if you set
it in the WM_HINTS structure. If you specify NoPPosition, then it won't 
use that hint. It will always use USPosition hints. If it works for some
window managers, but not others, then maybe you're not setting the hint
before you map the window, or maybe you're getting it a little mixed
up, and fvwm just doesn't quite parse the hints correctly

I've just started to play around with fvwm 2.0 and noticed that
the TogglePage command is no longer valid.  Is there an equivalent
command for doing the same thing (i.e. toggle page scrolling on/off)?
I couldn't find any in the fvwm manpage or the FAQ.  Also, I'm new to
this mailing list, so if this has been covered before, my apologies.

Thanks,

James.

Hi!

I had no problems compiling pl37 on my SGI Indigo (running Iris 5.3).
But when I start it ('fvwm2'), the screen blanks for half a second,
then everything's locked up.
No window has keyboard focus, ie. all cursors are 'hollow'.  The
only way to get out of this is to cut and paste 'killall fvwm2' with
the mouse. :-(

I had tried pl36 before, same result.

Running v1.21c, everything was fine.  Running v1.24r, everything was
fine on 1024x768 displays, but on my 1280x1024 (Elan graphics), every
now and then I had the same effect:  All of a sudden while working
everything locked up.

I tried to capture the FvwmDebug output of v1.24r, and already sent
it to this mailing list.

Maybe you could have a look into this problem before you decide
to release v2.0, Chuck?  I would really like to use the new
features, but the problem seems to get worse in every version?

I am willing to help as much as I can.

Ciao,
 Andy.

Yes, I have the list software do this on all of my lists.  It really helps
those who don't have their mail automatically filtered; if you do have mail
filtering it should be easily possible for you to remove the list tag from
the subject.  I already posted a Procmail recipe to do it (which was later
corrected).

While trying out Mark's idea about using FvwmCpp to define an INFO style, I
discovered that FvwmCpp was looking for /usr/lib/cpp and not finding it
(it's in /usr/ccs/lib/cpp). I thought this was odd because the correct path
for cpp is used in all the Makefiles. 

Then I looked at FvwmCpp.c and here's what I found:

char *cpp_prog = "/usr/lib/cpp";          /* Name of the cpp program */


This definition should come from the CPP definition in the Makefile.

TogglePage doesn't exist in fvwm2.0

The functionality is replaced by EdgeScroll, which you can stick in a
menu by doing something like:

AddToMenu Utilities	"Utilities"	Title 	
+			"Paging ..."	Popup Paging-Style
[rest of menu elided]

AddToMenu Paging-Style 	"Paging Options" Title	
+			"OFF"	EdgeScroll 0 0
+			"ON"	EdgeScroll 100 100
+			"Horizontal Only"	EdgeScroll 100 0
+			"Vertical Only"		EdgeScroll 0 100
+			"Partial"		EdgeScroll 50 50

So you see, it's more powerful with the (minor) inconvenience that you
can't stick it on a button (can you?).

Okay, I just looked at the man page (I know, I should have done that before
writing my last post), and it explains how to use a different cpp. However,
I still think the default should be the value of CPP in the Makefile.

Meanwhile, Mark's suggestion isn't working. I created a file called
.fvwm-styles with one line:

    #define INFO NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0

I call it in .fvwmrc like this just before my Style assignments:

    FvwmCpp .fvwm-styles

The result is the following message:

    fvwm: bad style command: INFO

Am I missing something?

I just tried this. It does work for me, but only for a full start. A
simple restart will not pick the styles up, or if you subsequently
restart the styles will be lost.

This is for 2.0pl37 on a Solaris-2.3 box.

Use EdgeScroll. You can set 'EdgeScroll 0 0' or 'EdgeScroll 0 100' or
'EdgeScroll 100 100' or 'EdgeScroll 100 0' (or whatever) at any time
you want.  Of course it's not TRUELY equivalent of TogglePage, but
this way is more flexible, and this is why TogglePage is disappeared.

(If you wanna patch which adds TogglePage to fvwm-2, email to me).

Is it time to retry to use autoconf, to setup OS specific section of
configure.h, which I did in old days ? (but I forgot all about it :-)

gailg> This definition should come from the CPP definition in the Makefile.

How about using -cppprog option ?

Yes, I realized this after I sent that message. I put the two appropriate
Style lines in with the #define statement in the .fvwm-styles file, but it
still didn't work.

Yes. This isn't what I suggested :-).

The CPP define *must* go in the same file that contains the
styles. You have to split off the styles from the rest of you .fvwmrc
file. All your style directives should be moved to .fvwm-styles (or
whatever you use).

What's happening to you is that FvwmCpp reads the #define INFO
performs any expansions (none) in your case, and then passes the
result to fvwm (comment lines in your case). Subsequently, INFO is not
defined for the rest of your .fvwmrc file, you try to use it, and fvwm
issues the error.

I use the AutoRaise feature of FVWM (with a time delay of course....) & have
noticed that very, very often when using Motif applications, if I'm not very
deliberate when dragging down an application pulldown menu, FVWM often raises 
the application main window "in front" of the pulldown menu. The FVWM pull down
menus are always fine. I'm not being two-thumbed when I do this operation
and since I haven't let go of the menu yet, I don't understand why the
main window is getting focus for the autoraise.  I'm running FVWM 2.24 using 
the FvwmAuto module, but I've also seen this behavior back in the 1.24 days 
when autoraise was builtin. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yes!!  I've noticed this too, in these three situations (all with
2.0plXX):

 o Not using FvwmAuto at all.
 o Using FvwmAuto with a small time delay (0).
 o Using FvwmAuto with a large time delay (9999).

So I feel that there's still some internal fvwm code that messing
something up.

Best regards,

-Elan

This ist true, if editing the .fvwmrc remains the only way to configure
the behaviour.  But if one is going to write a GUI to aid the
configuration of fvwm without resoting to use a text editor, the feature 
you suggested will make this job harder.  I don't know much about
'FvwmConfig', since it was not available in fvwm-1.24r, but I would
love to see a nice GUI Frontend for editing ~/.fvwmrc.  This would
allow a much easier use for those casual users, which are unfamilar 
with the editing of ~/.*rc-files.

BTW: Has anyone here had a look into dotfile.tar.gz, which should be
available from ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile (Europe)?  I've this
reference in my clipboard for some weeks now, but since I've only
mail/news access to the net, I haven't got someone to fetch this software 
for me yet.

I knew I could do that, I just want to avoid doing that;
it is a very unclean solution to the problem. I always start up 
one xterm so if fvwm fails and my session falls back on a wm I don't
have configured (or no wm at all), I will have a shell to work in. I
considered it a bug since I have never seen this behavior in another
window manager (MWM). 

FVWM must be getting the information it uses to decorate the window 
from somewhere. It looks to me as if it is accessing something that 
hasn't finished initializing, but it doesn't seem to know that it's 
not finished initializing, and continues.

I had the exact same problem compiling pl37 under Linux 1.2.1, gcc
2.6.3, Xfree 3.1.1. Nothing goes to stdout or stderr when pl37 starts
up. (Suspiciously, when I tried to put pl37 in the background with
"fvwm2 &", the shell never returned a process id for the new task.) I
don't know about pl36; the last version I was able to get compiled and
running was pl24 (due to time constraints, not technical problems.)

That's strange. Here's what I have:

rxvt &
fvwm&
exec rxvt

and both windows are properly managed.

i'm using fvwm 2.0 pl 37...my restart function looks like:

AddToFunc	RestartFunction	"I"	Exec	/afs/iastate.edu/rental/kerplunk/lib/fvwm2/killXload
+				"I"	Module	FvwmButtons
+				"I"	Module	FvwmAuto	750

where killXload is a shell script that kills stray xload processes.  i
swallow xload in my FvwmButtons, and when i restart fvwm, it seems to
like to leave these xloads running... :(

my question is, is there a way to make sure that FvwmButtons gets run
only after this script has completed?  alternatively, is there a way to
make fvwm not leave these stray processes around? ;)

any help would be appreciated...

Every fvwm fan should have a look at http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/
to find out what Peter is referring to.  The "Dotfile Generator" even has
a special module set up for graphically configuring fvwm in all of its
details.  This web site has all of the details.

I have just started using fvwm and I like it very much.
However, I cannot figure out how to do one thing:
-  how can I prevent fvwm from changing focus when I change 
the window (I would like to have to click in a window to change focus)

Any help will be appreciated,

I've been having a lot of difficulty getting the latest fvwm distribution
(patchlevel 34) to compile on Solaris-2.4.  Before proceeding, I wonder
if someone might have some notes which are applicable to this.

I am using GCC (precompiled) and not the commercial CC environment... have
not had problems compiling anything else.

Thank you.

Thanks for the hint, Mark; but it does not work for me (pl37,
Linux-1.2.13, XFree-3.1.2):

    AddToMenu Utilities	"Utilities"	Title

Hi there.

I just downloaded the fvwm package to compile on my machine. 
I have a DG/UX machine aviion 300 series. the problem is that it is giving me
a lot of compiling errors. I wonder if any  one  uses the DG/UX Unix 
environment so he/she may help me. Once a few months ago I was able to
compile fvwm on a DEC/ultrix system so problem there, but this DG/UX Unix 
system is giving me real headaches.

 So, please anyone who uses DG/UX Unyx system and has been able to compile
Fvwm succesfully, please send me a mail.

thx

I'm also curious...or did I just miss a man page entry?

Wow!  A person after my own mindset.  I've not seen Geos, but I would
definately be pleased to see Fvwm's 'styles' or whatever include
'MenuStyle' of some form or another.  And I would definately like to
see the fvwm modules shair code with the wm whenever it is done through
a shaired library, to save space...
Maybe we could even (ghasp) have olvwm emulation?  hehehe...that would
turn a few heads...

As a side note, I'd like to see a 'OS/2' style icon manager inwhich
icons only appear when the window is iconized if it is set to go to
the icon manager, the size of the icons can be 'changed onthefly' and
the 'arrangement' of the icons can be changed by dragging them around,
and/or arranging them; and the text wraps below the icon rather than
in one 'bar' below the icon for miles in both directions; and the
spacing of the icons is allowed to vary based on the text-size below
the icon...

While I'm on OS/2, anychance some 'settings' ?module? could be created
to allow per-window styles that change on-the-fly?  I mean, it is
nice for styles to say 'Style "*rxvt*" blah' but, well, what if I
want some rxvt's to have 'Style "rxvt" NoTitle' and others not?  Currently
I don't know if this is possible; if it is it would envolve changing
the titles of the windows and then using FvwmTalk to change the style
for that title of a window, and then issuing 'Recapture'.  It would
be a nice edition for fvwm, imho, if I could have a 'function' or
'module' invoked in the same way as 'Identify' such that I click on
a window, choose it's new style, and it and only it gets redrawn.

BTW, whatever happened to the days when 'restart fvwm' meant that
the boarders on windows disappeared, and then one-by-one the windows
disappeared, re-appearing with the fvwm decoration?  Is there a
reason for the 'black screen' before fvwm starts?  If there is, maybe
I missed it somewhere...imho it is annoying and time-consumptive...

gotcha.  I am getting itchy fingers abit, so if I get some time, I may
well at least look at the sourcecode...I do know C, but not Xlib...so
I am one step ahead of you :-)

If my understanding about fvwm source, this can be done in current
fvwm, I think. In fact, 'Style' built-in function (and some built-in
function) is context-dependant, i.e., order of 'Style' command have a
meanings.

If you wanna do described above, try:

	Style "*rxvt*" blah
	Style "rxvt" NoTitle

Window "foorxvtbar" matches only first Style command, but window
"rxvt" matches first and second, so "rxvt" has no title, but blah
style is also defined (of course, if blah has 'Title', this is ignored
by second 'NoTitle').

While this will work in this instance, I was more referring to the ability
to 'dynaically' point, click, and tell fvwm I want __THIS__ window to not
have a title bar...rather than having to plan-ahead and change the title,
etc....

I haven't looked to the source, but doesn't fvwm keep track of each window
by it's id anyway?  Wouldn't it be possible to allow something along the
lines of:

AddToMenu "Style Changes"
+ "Remove Title Bar" Style NoTitle
+ "Add Title Bar" Style Title


??

I know this would probably not be the exact implementation, but it is
what I am asking about...

Has anyone else noticed the built in window list now seems to need 2
keypresses to select a window by number? It still works fine when you
click on an entry, but selecting the associated key takes 2 trys.

If you look at the code of FvwmAuto (which works the same way as the AutoRaise
feature of 1.24), this is what is expected, I'm afraid. "very deliberate when
dragging", in more technical terms, means "change focus to the menu before the
autoraise timeout expires".

A change to FvwmAuto I still have to test is to reset the autoraise timer
whenever a new window is created (that is, FvwmAuto must spy AddWindow
messages).

Meanwhile, you can try this:

- - Put the mouse on the application window containing the menus;
- - Wait that window is raised
- - pull down any menus you like, waiting for the timeout between them!

You may also play w/ the timeout value to find the best value for you.

I'm currently working on a better Autoraise module, to allow for window and
class specific autoraise. Wishes and suggestions welcome!

I would get gcc built before I tried to compile anything.  Just a
thought.

I find this problem very strange, but apparently we are the only
ones who have experienced this.  Besides you nobody even sent a
remark on my problem.

Maybe we did something wrong in configuring, but I wouldn't know what?!
Or is it something in the config file?!  I am at the end of my wits. :-(

By the way, I *do* get a process id when I call "fvwm2 &":
 hamster:~>fvwm2 &
 [1] 2951

But then I have to kill it (using mouse copy&paste) in order to
do anything after starting fvwm. :-((

Thanks for your mail,
 Andy.

Howdy all.

In case anyone noticed my silence over the past few days, it's because
I've been out of town on business.  I'm still going through all the
email I got while I was gone, so I'll be mailing out responses as I
get time to do so.

Just thought I'd let you all know.

Yes, I noticed it on my Linux 1.2.13 system (under both a.out and ELF) and
ClickToFocus globally enabled.  It only seems to take 2 keystrokes if you
are solely selecting by number.  Both clicking with the mouse and using
arrows keys work fine. 

Other than that, 2.0pl37 has been wonderfully stable for me.

I've noticed the problem when I wasn't running FvwmAuto.  Am I just
hallucinating, or is the problem in the core fvwm code?

Yes, I see this problem on any window with the "StaysOnTop" Style.  Any
pulldown menu in a "StaysOnTop" window has to be clicked on TWICE to get the
menu to stay on top.

I'm using 2.0pl35 and I don't use FvwmAuto.

Well, I just had one of our X11/Motif gurus look at the problem of the 
main application window being auto-raised over popup/pulldown menus in Motif
applications when the timer goes off. This appears to be a bug/design-flaw
in the Xt intrinsics definition of "override shell" windows. By ICCCM 
definition, the window manager is supposed to ignore everything about "override
shell" windows (which is what Motif menus use as well as 'xman' & most Tcl/Tk 
applications). Unfortunately, this doesn't allow the window manager to know
there is a menu there, so that is why the application window is raised 
"as intended". Fixing it in fvwm would probably be a violation of the ICCCM,
so someone should let the X Consotium know about this (I've never dealt with 
them) in case they want to address the problem someday. For now, I'll just
make sure I let fvwm auto-raise the application window before grabbing
menus.

Of course, I forgot that! "StaysOnTop" is a thinly disguised "autoraise"
feature. It means:

 'after any window config. change (desktop change, paging, new window, raise,
etc...), send this window a "Raise" command'

That's why you need that 2nd click...

I'd love this.

I don't have too many problems with menus, 'cause I don't use Motif
menus much, but I have many overlapping windows.  Often what will happen
is I'll put a cursor on window A (almost always Emacs) and quickly hit a
key which causes another window B to deiconify under my mouse and now be
selected: I want the new window to be on top.

But FvwmAuto then raises window A when the autoraise timeout expires,
and I have to send it to the background to see window B again.

Another thing that happens which is also annoying is that I'll move my
mouse to the title bar to left-click the top window into the back, but
I'll overshoot briefly onto another window or the root.  Then I move my
mouse back to the top window, which causes the autoraise timer to start,
left-click it to the back.  Then when the autoraise timer goes off, it
comes back to the front.  Sometimes I can get into this rhythm where
I'll keep left-clicking a window into the back and FVWM keeps stubbornly
raising it again for 4 or 5 times! :)

I want autoraise to basically keep track when a new window is selected,
and junk any old autoraise in progress and start a timer for the newly
selected window.  It seems to do this normally (if you move to window A
then back again it doesn't raise window A), but not when windows are
explicitly deiconified or raised.

Does that make sense?  I'd be very willing to alpha- or beta-test any
patches to FvwmAuto you have :)

I am using "Fvwm Version 2.0 pl 37 compiled on Oct 12 1995 at
13:20:26", and have found a bug that did not exist in "Fvwm Version
1.24r".

I am running Solaris 2.3 on a sparc 5.  I start "fvwm" with "openwin".

The problem I found, or should I say bug, is that on certain windows I
have "NoIconTitle" set and when I start Fred, (that's my name for
fvwm), any window I have this set for starts in the upper left corner,
not in their designated location.  That is until I click on the icon,
then it moves to the correct spot.  Also the identify module will not
identify any of these icons with no titles.

With Fred version 1.24r these icons where placed in their correct spots
but the identify module still did not work.

If anyone can help me out I would be greatly appreciative.

That's why I find the "default" 500ms timeout a bit tight. 750-1000 is more
like it (and more than that is too sluggish).

Hmm. Yes, that's how it works (should work). I'm sure there is a catch mixing
deiconify/raise/focus/whatever events, but the most common trouble is the
timing. Unix/X is not real-time, you know... A thorough check of all event
timestamps (possible in 2.0!) is REALLY complicated.

Welllll... The prototype I have is not a patch, but a *new* module, written in
Python. Of course, after getting things right, the algorithm can go to a
C module as a patch... If I have the time ;-)

(BTW, that module now correctly emulates/substitutes FvwmAuto, FvwmAudio,
FvwmClean (the "famous" AutoLower module!), and, basically, any
non-X-interface module. Latest version works w/ 2.0 (I switched last week,
finally) and can use Python's tkinter -- that is, Tk widgets...)

Ah.  I didn't think of that.  Well, humph.  I wonder if there's a simple
way to absolutely verify that it's a delivery time/order from the server

Uh...I figured out why the mini icons weren't working. I hate to admit it,
but it's very similar to the old "Is your computer plugged in?" problem. I
had looked at the tar file, but not extracted the files from it! 

I finally realized this today (it was kind of on the back burner). Now I'd
like to see more from the artist. I made some for iconify, maximize, and
stick, but I can't think of what to do for close or refresh. And I'd like
some for all the other stuff I use (like calculator and rolodex). I can make
them myself, but if more are coming, I'd like to see them.

This is the same as my problem with my calendar icon. I didn't make the
connection of it being set for "NoIconTitle" but that's true. And I did
notice that Identify doesn't work for it, but somehow I thought maybe it
didn't work for icons in general--I didn't really test it.

Hi all,

Can anyone recommend a 2.0plXX version that's pretty rock-solid and
hassle free incorporating all the latest neat stuff?  Is pl37 pretty
solid?  I'll be compiling for Linux 1.2.13 (and above) and HPUX.  

Thanks for your recommendations!

I tried recently to use FvwmCpp to process my .fvwmrc (I didnot want
m4 because of the 'include' mess).
 
 - First problem, I could not get FvwmCpp to work at all. I guess I
did not use the good options, and would be pleased if someone told me
what to do...

So, what I have done now is to convert my .fvwmrc to use cpp, which is
applied manually each time I make a change :-( Nevertheless, I had
several problems:

 - the use of # as a comment delimiter for fvwm conflicts with cpp. I
had to insert a space in front of the comments, which is not very
nice. I'd like to see an alternate comment delimiter in fvwm.

 - Since I use a sun, all the references to pixmap xterm-sun.xpm has
been replaced with xterm-1.xpm :-( No problem, I thought, I've just to
enclose the pixmap name in quotes. This does *not* work! This is
contradictory with the man page of fvwm which basically says that
quotes can be used anywhere.

 - And, finally, something that I've already written (but since I had
no echo, I could perhpas repeat it): I'd like to have the default
ModulePath hardcoded in fvwm, in order to use 'fvwm -f' in a simple
manner (It should be easy, since this info is known to the Imakefile).

Jean-Marc.

PS: On a related subject, does somebody knows of a clever way to use
cpp on the .Xdefaults file transparently?

Ok, my small miniXpmIconPackage is now availible via WWW at the
followin adress:
http://www.ies.luth.se/~s94a-lgn

Note that this is just temporary, and not anything special.
The page contains just the file, for you to download, if you want it.

By the way, it would be nice if some others created a couple of
14x14 miniicons to. I'll be happy to include them in the "package".

Ok, I know what the problem is here.  I can think of two ways to fix

pl38.

Since cpp strips comments by default, you could use C style comments
(/* comment */) in your .fvwmrc as well, since fvwm will never see
them.

I'm not sure I understand -- xrdb invokes cpp on the .Xdefaults file
by default. Is something besides xrdb used to get your .Xdefaults into
the X database?

Hi Chuck,

A minor suggestion: I think it would be nice if the releases untarred into
a release specific directory, i.e., fvwm-2.0.38/ rather than just fvwm/.  

Thanks,
Eric

Okay, this isn't really an FVWM question, but it's loosely related because
I'm trying to make icons.

I want to make a doom icon (for the game Doom). I have a gif called
doomicon.gif which is appropriately small, but it uses 254 colors. What's
the best way to reduce the number of colors used? Is there a good way?

Thanks.

Hi Chuck,

thanks for all your hard work (really!)... now here goes... :)  I'm running
into a couple problems building 2.0.38 (which actually I've had before, and
only now am reporting -- I believe some have been discussed before as
well on the ML):

1) defining FVWM_LIBDIR in configure.h screws up the imake; the top level
Imakefile knows to use the system-wide lib, i.e.,

	imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R5/sun4/lib/X11/config

but then it chokes below that:

	cd libs; imake -DUseInstalled -I/u/ericding/lib/config ...

because it thinks LIBDIR = /u/ericding/lib!  This is bad... so for now I've
simply not defined FVWM_LIBDIR.

2) XPM_INCLUDES is still not being passed down to some directories:

making all in ./libs...
gcc -O -pipe   -I/usr/X11R5/sun4/include       -target sun4 -c  Picture.c

This dies because it doesn't see my xpm.h file in /u/ericding/include...
the variable *is* being used, as far as I can see, in ./xpmroot/Makefile,
though.  For now, I've manually stuck /u/ericding/include in the include
path.  

Same thing happens in ./fvwm subdirectory (icons.c), and in FvwmIconBox
(icons.c). 

3) When I do make install, because I've set FVWM_BINDIR and FVWM_LIBDIR,
these vars are substitute for BINDIR in all the directories; but X11R5 uses
BINDIR for mkdirhier, so that I get this problem (this is the output of
make -n install):

> if [ -d /u/ericding/bin ]; then set +x; \
> else (set -x; /bin/sh /u/ericding/bin/mkdirhier /u/ericding/bin); fi
> install -c   fvwm2 /u/ericding/bin
> echo "install in ./fvwm done"
> installing in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
> if [ -d "/u/ericding/lib/fvwm2" ]; then set +x; \
> else (set -x; /bin/sh "/u/ericding/lib/fvwm2"/mkdirhier "/u/ericding/lib/fvwm2"); fi

Thanks,
Eric

Hi all,

first... sorry about this flood o' bug reports.

ok, now, on to da bugs... 

1) in the ChangeLog, there was an indication that this was fixed:

       8. Patches to FvwmButtons to make it behave better when killed
          (kill swallowed modules, catch signals, etc)

This works, but only in *some* circumstances.  If I start FvwmButtons in my
.fvwm2rc, i.e.,

	AddToFunc RestartFunction       "I" Module FvwmButtons

then I still get X errors related to swallowing xload and xbiff when I
restart/kill fvwm.  *However*, if I delete that FvwmButtons and start up a
new one (i.e., from my pulldown menus), no errors on restart.

2) there are no explicit instructions (am I wrong?) on installing the icons
into the lib/fvwm2 (or wherever) directory.

Again, I'm using fvwm 2.0.38 on a SunOS 4.1.3... great job so far, Chuck!

thanks,
Eric

I have seen this personally myself.  I was just about to get my sysadmin
to install fvwm, and was standing there when he was compiling it, when
he showed me that he was going to have to edit every single makefile
for every single module.  Then we left because he suddenly felt tired.

:-(((((

Please could we get this fixed?

Also, could it be setup so that it would simply include <xpm.h> instead
of <X11/xpm.h> ??

My sysadmin wasn't happy about typing: 
ln -s /wherever/xpm/include /usr/local/include/X11

AND then it not letting the sub-makefiles know that /usr/local/include
is supposed to be in the include path...

Laterz,

Todd..tfries@umr.edu

...same thing here.  our xpm stuff is in a really non-standard place.  i
usually just let make barf, and then edit the source files that make it
barf to reflect the path...i'd really like to see this fixed, and i'd
fix it if i had the know-how. :)

Hi,

Are you the current maintainer?  And is ftp.hpc.uh.edu the current
ftp site to get the latest version of fvwm?

Thanks in advance.

When executed 'Recapture' function, fvwm losts to see WM_HINTS hints.

You may eproduce this bug in a following way (I checked with pre2.0pl37):

1) Start fvwm.
2) do 'xterm -iconic'. This acts well, i.e., starts with iconic state.
3) exit xterm executed in 2).
4) do 'Recapture'
5) do 'xterm -iconic' again. But xterm starts with normal state.

Sorry I've not found where is a bug in fvwm source. Add to BUGS list ?
or easy to fix ?

Is it possible to make diff's available between versions. This would be
much easier for me (and other low-bandwidth connections) to download.

Kees.

Thanks god, there is anybody alive!
So my congratulation to make a new
distribution release, i've been waiting a long time for.

So here my ideas for the Fvwm 3.0 Release:

        - seperate the Window Border and Menue Outline, 
	  to get the bowman direction back and to make 
	  it much easier to make a new outline (Lost95)

	- add drag&drop to root window and modules
	  ,especialy FvwmButton, with Motif Compatibility
	  I hope that the lesstif people will make a library,
	  so that having a drop target in fvwm will not
	  require Motif.
          An other way to integrate drag&drop is to use the 
          rdd library.
          
	- DrawOut Module, an evolutionary step of the 
	  FvwmButton Module,  to save screen space
	
	- RollOut Module, nearly the same as DrawOut
	
	- FvwmCosy Module for having an Cosy like
	  enhanced interface:
	  in the middle you select with the button the
	  desired Desk or can toggle to see the Pager of the 
	  Desk

	- FvwmClippbord Module, (part of FvwmCosy) where to
          drag images out of the web browser, switch the
          desk to another application and take it from the 
          clippboard

        - Make a Fvwm-library, that every application using
          this will easy be able to use Fvwm features.
        
        - Support Session Management through Fvwm library 


I think these steps will make the Fvwm more than only a
Window Manager. So let's talk about the next release, now

Thats a good idea.

is some kind of magic option somewhere to force the use of xrdb, I'd
like to know about it.

Howdy all.

In case anyone noticed my silence over the past few days, it's because
I've been out of town on business.  I'm still going through all the
email I got while I was gone, so I'll be mailing out responses as I
get time to do so.

Just thought I'd let you all know.

You could try using xv to dither it down to less colors, then save it
out with the reduced color set, then repeat until it gets down to a
manageable amount.  I believe that's how I did it when I needed to do
something similiar.

I've been contemplating that for some time, actually.  Perhaps I'll
start doing that for the next pl release.

Hm.  How very odd.  I can reproduce this though, so at least it's

I've been meaning to do this.  I'll see if I can make it possible for
the next (and future) releases, but I can't promise remembering to do
it every time. :)

The file xpm.h should be in a directory somewhere/X11 and not just somewhere.
It (XPM) was written as an X application. Note the libXpm.a nameing 
convention. #include <X11/xpm.h> is what should be used.

Your xpm installation is incorrect. You can as a work around do this;
cd somewhere; ln -s . X11
or even better;
mkdir somewhere/X11; mv somewhere/xpm.h somewhere/X11

The other problem you mentioned will be fixed however.

Hi Fvwmers,

I think configure.h should contain lines like
#define FVWM fvwm2
and
#define FVWM fvwm

rather than

#define FVWM            fvwm2
and
#define FVWM            fvwm

since the last ones cause errors during the installation. If I "make install"
on SGI, I get:
bsdinst -c              fvwm2 /u/corse/0/devernay/sgi5/bin/           fvwm2
/etc/install: can't create fvwm2/fvwm2: Not a directory.
(the extra spaces come from the #define)



Also, I retried the "NoClass" patch by replacing the #if 0 and #if 1
in the code as follows and defining NOCLASSPATCH in configure.h:

diff fvwm/add_window.c ../../fvwm/fvwm/add_window.c
128c128
< #if 0
---
> #ifdef NOCLASSPATCH
135c135
< #if 1
---
> #ifndef NOCLASSPATCH
diff fvwm/misc.c ../../fvwm/fvwm/misc.c
198c198
< #if 0
---
> #ifdef NOCLASSPATCH

and everything seems to run OK here. Since this was disabled I guess
somebody experienced crashes because of that patch but I didn't get
any in several weeks of intensive use.  What kind of problem happen
with that patch and in what situation? I definitely _want_ titles on
my windows that have titles but no class.

Hi, fellow fvwm users.

I have a suggestion on the color usage in the menu icon package: Use
the 32 colors that is defined in the AIcons package (found at
ftp.x.org I think). We are still a large amount of people stuck with
8bit displays or worse, and I need as many free colors I can get to
use some data visualization programs (I prefer not be forced to use
private colormaps).

What is AIcons? It is a LARGE collection of pixmaps & bitmaps
approx. 5000 items. A lot of very cool icons. They all use the same 32
colors. 

Attached is the default colormap from the AIcons package,
colormap.xpm:
/* XPM */
static char * colormap_xpm[] = {
/* width height ncolors chars_per_pixel */
"6 5 30 1",
/* colors */
" 	c black",
".	c DarkSlateGrey",
"X	c SlateGrey",
"o	c grey",
"O	c gainsboro",
"+	c white",
"@	c navy",
"#	c blue",
"$	c DodgerBlue",
"%	c SkyBlue",
"&	c lavender",
"*	c cyan",
"=	c purple",
"-	c firebrick",
";	c SeaGreen",
":	c LimeGreen",
">	c green",
",	c PaleGreen",
"<	c magenta",
"1	c red",
"2	c tomato",
"3	c orange",
"4	c gold",
"5	c yellow",
"6	c violet",
"7	c sienna",
"8	c peru",
"9	c tan",
"0	c wheat",
"q	c LemonChiffon",
/* pixels */
" .XoO+",
"@#$%&*",
"=-;:>,",
"<12345",
"67890q"};


Just a small suggestion, I'm gonna convert all icons to this colormap
anyhow.

Oh, is icons in the titlebar gonna show up soon?

Best regards,
Roy.

Hello,

I am using fvwm version 2.35 and seems stable. I do have a question
concerning FvwmWinList module. Currently i am binding it to my mouse 3
key:

Mouse 3 R       A       FvwmWinList Transient
	instead of:
Mouse 3	R    	A      	WindowList

What can  i do to make FvwmWinList to behave like WindowList in such a
way that if i push down the mouse key on the extreme right of my
screen (on root window), the list will pop up in the opposite
direction (to the left) and similarly if i push the mouse key on the
left, top or bottom of root window.

Currently i set it to have the FvwmWinlist pop up on the bottom right 
and i can't see much if i do it at the right edge or bottom edge of
the screen.

Anyhelp will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Tuan Hoang

I was wondering what the rationale behind that patch was.  Now that I
know what you wanted from it, I'll try and make it happen correctly.

The real problem that I recall (there may have been others) was in
module communication.  Plus, I didn't want NULL values for Name,
Class, etc.  I'd much rather have windows that don't have a name to be
renamed in fvwm internals to Untitled and those that don't have a
class to be given one of NoClass, so that they are evident and can be
controlled w/ Style commands.

I'll fix the code to make sure NoClass windows get thier titles from
the name, as it sounds like that's the real problem, correct?  I have
a small program that I can modify to test the different combinations
of Name, IconName, Class, and Resource to make sure that they are
treated ok for the next patchlevel.

I've been meaning to reduce the number of colors anyways, but a small
standard colormap for the pixmaps is even better.  It looks like a
good representative of colors.

Roy> Just a small suggestion, I'm gonna convert all icons to this

Do you have a script or program to do this, or are you going to do it
all by hand?  If you have a script or program, you could send it to me
and I'll run it on my stuff for the next patchlevel, or you could
point me to a tar file after you convert them.  The only reason I
didn't use the quantize_pixmaps script is that it doesn't handle
transparent colors well.  So, if you have another way to do it...

Roy> Oh, is icons in the titlebar gonna show up soon?

Perhaps eventually, but not soon.

Thanks,
Chuck

Okay, so I compiled the netpbm package and played around with converting.
The doomicon.gif converts pretty well and it's the right size for a normal
icon. However, what started me on this expedition was attempting to make my
own mini icons. I was hoping not only to convert one of the doom graphics
that I have, but also to miniaturize it. I was trying to get out of doing it
myself by hand. No such luck. I can convert doomicon.gif to 16 colors and it
looks pretty good in it's normal size, but when I try to make it tiny, it
becomes unreadable. 

By the way, attempts to convert the doom icons that came with fvwm to 16
colors failed. Or rather, xpaint complains that it can't allocate the colors
when I try to open the files, so obviously ppmquant is using 16 difficult
colors. In fact, I wasn't able to get xpaint to open doomface.xpm until I
converted it to 8 colors (I tried everything from 16 down to 8), and then it
looked really dull.

14x14 is a great size for a mini-icon, but it's tough to work with. Some
people seem to be good at hinting at detail that isn't really there. I have
yet to master that skill.

You're right.  I had the same problem on my SGI, too.

I am having big troubles to get fvwm2 to run on my SGIs.  Maybe
you could help me a little, since I assume I must have done something
vital wrong.  Could you please send me your config.h and Imakefile?

On what machine are you compiling it?  I got a Indigo with an
Elan graphics board.  Output of uname -a is:
 IRIX hamster 5.3 11091811 IP20 mips

I also tried running it on a Indy with IRIX 5.3 IP22, but no success.

Thanks in advance,
 Andy.

PS: Please anyone else on this mailing list, who is running fvwm2
    on an SGI, could you send me your config.h and Imakefile?
    Thanks so much!

Basically, I believe that FvwmWinList would have to be modified to
check it's popup position and move itself & the pointer.  Probably not
all that difficult to add.  I'll put it on the TO-DO list.

BTW - pl35 has some bugs that you may run across that have been fixed
in the later levels.  You might want to get a newer one (like pl38 or
shortly, pl39).

Not sure I understand exactly what you were doing, but did you try
shrinking/smoothing it first with xv, or even pbmtools?  Then, wouldn't
the conversion process work on the smaller gif?

Just a thought.

I just compiled and installed pl38. Installing was much smoother than last
time. However, there remain problems in the libs directory. I think you're
using Xpm in there but it's not in the Imakefile. First, make depend
complained that it couldn't find xpm.h, so I put a link to my
/work/include/X11 directory in the libs directory and that worked. But then,
during actual compilation, it complained again, so I checked the Imakefile
and it was missing the "EXTRA_INCLUDES" stuff, so I copied that from the
Imakefile for xpmroot and it worked after that.

So, Chuck, please make this change to libs/Imakefile for the next pl. Then
all will be fine (until something else goes wrong :).

Thanks.

I think it's about time we decided on what the F in FVWM stands for, since
it's been in doubt ever since fvwm 0.9 something, when it was no longer
considered "feeble" :)

Okay, I'll join the crowd. Here are my pixmaps.

File List:

doomicon.xpm	Icon for sunxdoom (which doesn't give it's window a class,
		name, or anything, so creating a style for it is, currently, 
		impossible and thus this icon is currently unusable for this 
		purpose)
mini.sol.xpm	Mini icon for xsol
mini.stick.xpm	Mini icon for (Un)Stick
mini.iconify.xpm	Mini icon for (De)Iconify
dockit.xpm	Icon for Frame documents
dockit2.xpm	Prettier (IMHO) version of above
bookkit.xpm	Same as dockit.xpm but in red instead of blue
bookkit2.xpm	Again, prettier version of above

I'm compiling fvwm2.0.38 under OSF/1 3.2 and I ran into another Makefile
problem. This one doesn't have to do with xpm, but rather the creative
use of "BINDIR"
Here's what I get when I try to "make install"

csugrad:/home/eburke/fvwm# make install
installing in ./libs...
/usr/bin/X11/install.sh -c -m 0644 libfvwm2.a /usr/lib/X11
install in ./libs done
installing in ./fvwm...
/usr/bin/X11/install.sh -c -s  fvwm2 /usr/bin/X11
install in ./fvwm done
installing in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
+ /bin/sh /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/mkdirhier /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 
/bin/sh: /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/mkdirhier: cannot open
*** Exit 1
Stop.
*** Exit 1
Stop.

Here is what is going wrong:

csugrad:/home/eburke/fvwm-> grep BINDIR modules/FvwmAudio/*
modules/FvwmAudio/Imakefile:BINDIR = FVWM_MODULEDIR
modules/FvwmAudio/Makefile:           BINDIR = /usr/bin/X11
modules/FvwmAudio/Makefile:        MKDIRHIER = /bin/sh $(BINDIR)/mkdirhier
modules/FvwmAudio/Makefile:BINDIR = "/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2"
modules/FvwmAudio/Makefile:     @if [ -d $(DESTDIR)$(BINDIR) ]; then set +x; \
modules/FvwmAudio/Makefile:             else (set -x; $(MKDIRHIER) $(DESTDIR)$(BINDIR)); fi

The directory /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 does not exist. So, it tries to do a
$(MKDIRHIER) $(BINDIR) which equals $(BINDIR)/mkdirhier $(BINDIR)

Once the directory /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 does exist, everything goes smoothly.

Sorry. this was due to differences in the Imake configuration of X11R6 
(which I used initially) and X11R5 and others.
I have sent a number of patches back to Chuck to fix the problems 
mentioned over the last many days. I did not get these to him in time for 
2.0.38 I am sorry to say.

This problem is easy to fix. Just add the following to makefile.h 
somewhere in the top half;

MKDIRHIER = mkdirhier

I don't have any real ground-breaking ideas myself, right now, but one 
feature I would like to see in fvwm is pie menus.

Every time this comes up, I suggest Flexible - it seems to suit fvwm quite
well because of its strengths in user configuration and modularity.

I think tradition sais it's unknown, so it should be left that
way. Anyway, a cool Unix program should have something weird about its
name. An unknown name is rather weird, so fvwm is a cool
program. (Yeah, bad logic, I know...)

Hello, mailinglist.

I am going to convert the miniicons to use the AIcons colormap. The new

my web page http://www.ies.luth.se/~s94a-lgn  tomorrow (20th).

I just installed Wabi on my system & noticed that the FvwmAuto features
don't seem to work correctly with it. It appears to be unnoticed by autoraise
since I have to click to raise it & other windows will immediately raise
over it (ignoring the timer). It also doesn't appear on fvwm's builtin window 
list nor on FvwmWinList's list. It also appears to be doing all of its own
window decorations (maybe that's intentional...?). I'm running fvwm 2.24.

Any ideas?

Yes there is, but I didn't see the announcement that I posted
either...

Jason, is there a problem with the announcements list?  Should I just
post to the discussion list from now on?

Thanks,

I have noticed this with some Sun applications as well.  (more info later)
It needs to be fixed I think before the public release gets out of the door?
Otherwise there are no serious problems as far as I can see.

When I move windows in the current page to different pages, some windows are
too small to grab in the Pager. So I'd like to grab a window with the title
bar or whatever, in real size, and move it into the Pager, in small size. 
Can I do this in FVWM?

Why isn't the window created by FvwmPager affected by FvwmAuto? I call
FvwmPager first, i.e.:

AddToFunc InitFunction	"I" Module FvwmPager 0 1
+			"I" Module FvwmAuto 200

I have the Pager Style set to NoTitle, so the only way to bring it to the
foreground is to click on the border, which is small and so clicking
sometimes results in bringing up my main menu or starting a resize on the
pager.

Also, how can I get it to display proportionally? I define my pager as
follows:

*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 50
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmPagerGeometry -0-0
*FvwmPagerHilight #cab3ca
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Misc
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Maker
*FvwmPagerRows 2
*FvwmPagerColumns 1
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8

When it comes up, its geography is 35x56. This makes all the windows look
really tall and thin. Experimentation has shown me that 55x55 (or any 
geography where x and y are equal) would be perfect. But changing
FvwmPagerGeometry and FvwmPagerDeskTopScale didn't work. For example,
removing FvwmPagerDeskTopScale and setting FvwmPagerGeometry to 55x55-0-0
resulted in a tiny pager with geometry of 26x12.

In this case, it sould be something like

  Fvwm is a Virtual Window Manager.

Personnally, I think, as Sverre Huseby wrote earlier, that the mistery
on the name is much more exciting than using a GNU-like acronym for
the 100th time. 

As it is, fvwm is a really configurable window manager: even its name
can be customized !

Not currently, no.  And in fact, I don't think that it could even be
possible the way that the pager is set up as a module.  If the
internal pager (like 1.xx) were still in there, that MIGHT be able to
be modified to handle this, but I don't think the external one will.

you'll also notice that wabi follows you all over the desktop whether
you make it sticky or not.  wabi basically ignores your window manager
and the idiots at sun consider this a feature (not only is it in the
wabi documentation, but when I complained about it in a user telephone
survey the interviewer told me I was wrong to consider it a misfeature
since, if I was running wabi then obviously the windoze apps are more
important than my Unix apps).  Note that it misbehaves this way
whether you run twm, fvwm, olwm, olvwm or any other window manager.  I
doubt there's much fvwm can do about it unless there's some way to get
a message to the x server that overrides it (I don't know enough X to
say one way or the other.  I gave up on wabi because of that and other
little pains in the butt (I couldn't install applications from
anything but floppies, for example).  Since I don't really need
windoze for my PC apps (what little I do need are much better served
by MAE even though I hate macintoys even more than I hate windoze)
that works fine for me.  Another person here who really wanted to use
wabi but hated the way it ignored his window manager ended up running
xnest and displaying wabi in the xnested server.  If that's an option
for you (it's not for me - I don't have time to install R6), you might
want to give it a try.

Yeah. RTFM. Wabi basically ignores everything and treats itself as its own
private window manager.  Nothing you can do about it, other than live with
the fact that any applications your run while in the Wabi session are on
your desktop just like the real Windows applications.

I've had a look into my english dictionary and stumbled over the
many adjectives starting with 'f':
   'featureless', 'fiddly', 'fiery', 'flaky', 'flawless', 
   'flashy', 'flexible', foamy', 'foolproof', 'forwardlooking', 
   'fragile', 'frail' ...
Since there are so many choices it is very hard to decide.  

I would prefer a positive adjective like 'final' or 'free'.
May be it should be left open as it is.

I think that would be best.  The FVWM now stands for "_Fill in the

Wabi isn't window manager friendly.  The problem that you are attempting
to address is an issue on all window managers that I'm aware.  Sunsoft
made some decisions early on to, in a sense, ignore the window manager
to get some added performance.

I agree. Personally, I find that the F word varies depending on whether I'm
enjoying the features of fvwm or cursing the bugs.

I think you should post the announcements to the discussion list anyway.

I didn't subscribe to the announcements list because I didn't see the need
to subscribe to two different lists when it should be fairly apparent on the
discussion list when the patches are coming out.  However, it would be nice
if I didn't have to guess.  ;-)

xrdb is usually run as part of your session start-up. For example, in
OpenWindows it is run from the "openwin" script; under xdm it is
run from your .xsession or the system Xsession file. It should be run
before starting fvwm.

You can run xrdb at any time to update the resources stored on the X
server (actually the resources are stored separately for each screen of
the server).  The new resources will affect any clients started from
then on. Xrdb defines various symbols using -D... that you can use to
select different sections in your .Xdefaults, for example whether the
display has colour. See the man page.

Not that I am necessarily suggesting it, but when I was running it at
work, someone came up and said "Oh, you're running Fred's Window
Manager".  I hadn't heard that one before...

Yes, the announcement list is fvwm-announce@hpc.uh.edu.  The reason neither
of you are seeing the announcement is because (prepare yourselves...)
neither of you have subscribed to the announce list.

CH> Jason, is there a problem with the announcements list?

No, I've seen all of the announcements that have gone across.

CH> Should I just post to the discussion list from now on?

I believe this is the best way to do things.  There's no point in asking
everyone to subscribe to a separate announce list just to get
announcements; instead I think people would subscribe to the announce list
if that's all they want to see.  Since it's not a really good idea to
subscribe one mailing list to another, it's best if you posted
announcements to both places.

How about doing it like the exmh and zsh mailing lists ?

Everybody who is subscribed to the main fvwm list is also subscribed to the
announcement lists - posts to the announcements list automatically go the the
mail list too.

?

Enjoy,
 Andrew.

I've always assumed it should stand for "free".  But, since that is so
obvious, and since no one ever suggests that, it must stand for
something else very specific, no?

	What's missing ? 
	I've compiled under same system fvwm pl34 correctly.
	I had same (or similar) problem with fvwm pl37.

	As far as I know the system has not changed.


	Thanking in advance

You will need to add "-lsocket -lnsl" to the second occurance of 
EXTRA_LIBRARIES.
in the FvwmPrompt Makefile. You may need to do this for FvwmAudio.

This will be fixed in the next release. I apologize for not getting these
patches to Chuck in time for the 2.0.38 release.

Charles,

first of all, thanks for picking up the care and feeding of fvwm.
We're all very appreciative :-)

In building the latest release, I noticed that the Imakefiles in some of the
subdirs redefine EXTRA_LIBRARIES -- on my platform (solaris 2.4) imake uses
this for -lsocket and -lnsl.  Instead of overriding EXTRA_LIBRARIES, for a
quick fix I changed them to:

EXTRA_LIBRARIES += new_defs

and everything builds cleanly.

Cheers,

Jeremy Payne

Is there anyway in fvwm to make it so that when you select a menu item, etc,
you can change the virtual window and the window you created will 
show up on the window you actually called it from rather than the one you 
are currently on?

Thanks-

Sure thing. Try something like this in the "Style Section";
Style "xmh"        StartsOnDesk 2
Style "matlab"      StartsOnDesk 3

Hello,

There is a small problem with the FvwmCpp module, either in the
manual or in the implementation :-)

The manual says:     -Cpp-opt  (to pass an option)
The FvwmCpp.c says:  -Cppopt   (WITHOUT the hyphen)

One of them needs changing in the next release.

Hi folks;

	I am trying to run fvwm 1.24r on an OSF machine ( alpha, of 
course ). I got it to complile after copying some headers and modifying 
them so that they would not reference incompatible union_wait structures 
(*&^(*( DEC! :-)

	Well, it runs, but there seems to be an error in parsing the 
module path:

Fvwm: No such module ~/fvwm/ GoodStuff
Fvwm: No such module ~/fvwm/ FvwmPager

* NOTE THE BLANKS! *

	this leaves me to think there is a space added on somewhere! I 
tried fiddling with configure.h and took a look at module.c and 
configure.c to no avail :-(

	any suggestions? failing that, can anybody tell me how to invoke 
the old built in ones? i undefined no pager and i cant figure out ho to 
make it work in the fvwmrc..

plz reply direct as i am no longer on the list...

tnx!

OK, given Restart's problems I was trying to avoid that, but it is
Monday morning, and the coffee isn't doen yet.

Yes, showps works (fails) the same under mwm or olwm; e.g., under mwm
it starts with 214 free, sucks up 77 to show a one-page PostScript b/w
document, and then returns 4 (leaving 141 free) upon exit. On the dull
side, it does seem to at least re-use the 73 it refuses to free up.

The above is true for olwm and fvwm, though as you noted fvwm takes a
few for itself for some pixmaps.

Hmm, I'm not sure but I don't think so. We got our copy bundled with
Adobe Illustrator. On the other hand, Acroread (Adobe's PDF format
file reader) shows the same behaviour, and it is free:

	ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/Applications/Acrobat/

One thing I should mention. I'm running this on an HP Aptrex
Xterminal (there is no DPS extension installed in it). The software
(showps, acroread) runs a third program called `dpsnxagent' to display
the PostScript on my screen. Perhaps it (being the common denominator)
is the culprit.

Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing if you or anyone else has similar
experiences with the acrobat software (if you can get it).

Well I have had a similar experience.  Indeed, I think that it was I who
contributed 'eek' to the subject line.  I have subsequently found out
what ate all of my colours in the colourmap.  The culprit was the beta
release of xdvi.  It has DPS support (can display embedded ps files in
a dvi document (nifty)), and when it hits a page with embedded ps it
zaps a whole lot of colours and it doesn't give them back.
Ghostscript for instance, does not do this; nor the old xdvi without dps.

I have contacted the xdvi maintainer and reported this behaviour as a bug
of the xdvi, though it might well be the dps of openwindows... 
(Running Solaris 2.4 here).  The maintainer hasn't come back to me about
it yet...

I think that the DPS on Solaris 2.4 may be related to Adobe.  Perhaps that is
the common denominator in all of these terrible thefts.

Okay, so is there a way to clear the colormap? A friend of mine gave me a
binary once that worked on his Sun4 (I'm using Solaris 2.4) because he
didn't have the source (it had been written and compiled by someone a long
time ago at his company and wasn't publicly available). Unfortunately, it
didn't work.

Are there any alternatives?

My 3 cents ...

I think the GNU recursive-acronym joke is getting a little tired.

I agree with the folks who don't feel the need to make it stand for
anything.

How about actively making it stand for nothing?

If we can have an "X" window system, or a "C" programming language, why
not an "F" Virtual Window Manager?

Is there any way in fvwm to change the geometry of a window based on its
class, using the Style mechanism?

We have an application that opens up lots of windows all the time, all
of which have a +0+0 geometry specified by the program itself. This
gets very annoying as every single window from the smallest dialog, file
requesters, alerts etc. all popping up on the same spot.

If I could specify where on the screen various important windows with known
classes would appear this would solve a large part of the problem.

This is off topic, but I gotta say it.  "C"'s name was derived from the name
of it's two predecccor languages, "BCPL" and "B".  

As far as FVWM is concerned.  Let's just not worry about it.  It's cool like
it is.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

When I switched over to fvwm-2, I found this really helped me with debugging
my .fvwmrc since it told on which line it found the problem.  It also adds
the filename in case you use M4 or cpp.

This is against patchlevel 33, but should apply easily to newer ones.

Hi,

I am running fvwm-2.0 patchlevel 37 on a Solais 2.4 machine. I have set up
the menus so that I launch an xterm from one of the items. However, on the
Solaris machine I get a message like this:

xterm: Error 14, errno 22: Invalid argument


and of course no xterm starts. Has anybody else seen this problem? It is
very strange becuase I also have fvwm running on some Ultrix machines, and
OSF/1 Alpha based machines. The same .fvwmrc file works fine on all these
machines except the solaris machines.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
-Greg

I attempted to install fvwm 2 pl 38 here today, on a x86 solaris 2.4
machine, shortly, what I did was check the paths in config.h, do the
xmkmf make makefiles and make procedur (openwindows xmkmf)..

On doing make install I noticed that some files were placed in
/usr/openwin/bin and others in /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2...

And if the /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 subdirs didn't exist I got the
errormessage: 
installing in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
+ /bin/sh /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/mkdirhier /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 
/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/mkdirhier: /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/mkdirhier: cannot open

Well shortly, do you have enuff control over xmkmf & co. to be able to
do a gnu-ish like --prefix flag (the installations 'root (put bin, man
lib below))

I believe these problems will be fixed for pl39.  I have some Imake
patches from Randall Winchester that address both of these problems, I
believe.

I would like to switch to AutoConf one of these days, but it probably
won't happen any time soon.

However, I was not clear enough in my original posting (which is included 
below.) I get this bizzarre error when I ask fvwm to launch an xterm 
WITHOUT any arguments. Everybody assumed that the problem was with the
arguments that I supplied, however, my 7 years of UNIX experience would
have allowed me to figure that one out. :) Here is a sample line from my
.fvwmrc file:

+	"Local"	Exec xterm

This has me a little stumped, mostely because I don't want to go in and
start kacking the source code to see what is going on. I really should be
finishing my thesis. :)

Anyway,
Thanks for the resonpses so far.

Dear contributors of the fvwm,

I had one problem about the first argument of a select().  In the fvwm, it
used a value named fd_width which is calculated in a GetFdWidth() at the
GetFdWidth.c.  It, fd_width, means the number of file descriptors.  However
a select() needs the number of file descriptors in fd_set structure.  It
means that the maximum of value must be equal to the size of fd_set
structure, I think.

In my netbsd, the size of fd_set is 256, and the number of file descriptors
is more than 5000.  When the fvwm call select(), select() destroy heaps
around fd_set structures.

I guess the fvwm should use the FD_SETSIZE as the number of file
descriptors.  However the fvwm is not such implementation.  Is there any
other problem?

Regards,
--- Kazushi

Hello Folks,

I have this little bug rearing its head.  I think it is a bug as it
is not only happening to me, but a few of my users as well.   Also 
it appears on both SunOs and Solaris versions.

It is as follows:
-----------------
I have EdgeResistance set to a particular value.
On start up (or restart for that matter), the system behaves as if the
EdgeResistance was set to 0.  ie. It does not permit the cursor to move
out of the screen.
However.  If I use my FvwmPager and point to some arbitrary other page,
and come back to my home page, then everything behaves as expected.  Thus
there is some initialisation problem I suspect.
Try it and tell me if the same occurs with you.

Cheers,
Jon

I'm running Fvwm 2.0 pl37 on a Solaris 2.4 machine. The problem is that
I can't use the CDE login  to login. I have to use the "Command Line Prompt"
option in CDE if I want to run fvwm. If I start an "Openwin" session, then
I get logged in but exit immediately [This is with fvwm as my window 
manager in my .xinitrc]
Does anyone know what the problem could be? I have no problems with fvwm
if I use the command line prompt, and then call 'openwin'.

I thought fvwm might be having a problem trying to find the
dynamically linked libraries, but I compiled it with the -R option to
cc, and it still behaved strangely.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Viren

Hello,

I would like to connect functions to the entries in a Fvwm Button bar, but
these should only be triggered when used for example with the right mouse
button. It is possible to define a function (using AddToFunction) that is
called when the button is pressed, but this triggers on all mouse buttons.

An example usage is:

 * Various desks for various actions (mail, development, etc)
 * When selecting a desk using the Left mouse button, I would like to
   switch to that desk
 * When using the Right mouse button, I would like to switch to that desk
   and show a popup menu specific for that desk

Can someone tell me if this is possible (using 2.0pl33 as pl37 will not
compile without an ANSI compiler)?

TIA,

Kees.

chuck_hines> I would like to switch to AutoConf one of these days, but
chuck_hines> it probably won't happen any time soon.

In old age (1.24c), I've try to do use GNU autoconf to setup OS
specific section (That's why current fvwm's configure.h says "this
stuff can be replaced with ...").

Following is the mail of what I did. I hope it'll be helpful (and be a
starting point) to fvwm contributors (includes me please) who just try
to do...

I think using autoconf is not difficult, but a little bit difficult to
decide what to autoconf :-)

Robert> OK, there must be some completely portable way to get the

Well, how about GNU autoconf solution ... ?

Here is a sample, patch to 1.24c. What it did is:

* create configure.in, sysdep.h.in (by autoheader) and configure (by
autoconf)
* modify source code to use sysdep.h information.

So, making fvwm procedure is

	a) do 'sh ./configure' to create sysdep.h
	b) xmkmf
	c) make Makefiles
	d) make

b) to d) is the same of current procedure.	

(Well, using 'sysdep.h' is a little bit ugly, merging to configure.h
is better...)

Hello Folks,

Many folks have experienced this problem, and I think it may have been the
cause of a couple of complaints here on the list as well.

patchlevel 38, version 2

When fvwm is called as the last thing in the .xinitrc, and in the 
.xinitrc there are a lot of calls to programs which take some time to
start up, then there seems to be some race condition and some windows
are not `captured' by fvwm, or get the wrong colour border, or in the worst
cases, fvwm doesn't work at all and you need to log in else where to kill
everything off.

I can get around it by either of the following:
  [1]  Not making fvwm the last entry in my .xinitrc, and making
       say a console window instead.  Of course, this means that I have
       to kill the console window to exit.
  [2]  Leaving it as the last entry, but starting up any heavy programs
       via the Init function of .fvwmrc
       This seems to work, and avoid the situation.

I suspect some race condition error in fvwm on start up.

Could somebody else try putting fvwm as last call in .xinitrc
with 15 "xload &" programs before it :-)

Jon

I tried this here (under AIX) and couldn't reproduce any problems.
All 16 xloads came up just ducky.  My suggestions:

  1) What system are you on again (Solaris?) and what compiler (&
     options) did you use to compile fvwm?  If you used gcc, certain
     versions of it are buggy, and if you're using -O3 or higher
     (under whatever compiler) that may be a mistake as well.  Try
     compiling fvwm w/ -g and run it w/ -debug to see if this clears
     anything up.  Also, what does FvwmIdent show for the windows that
     didn't get captured as opposed to those that it did?

  2) If you can't solve it, kick those things off w/ a sleep in front
     of them if they need to be delayed -> (sleep 5; xload &) &
     That way fvwm should start up before they come up, but still be
     the last thing in the .xinitrc.  Or, put a sleep 10 just before
     running fvwm, to give everything time to come up first.  Most
     sample .xinitrc files seem to do this for everything, so this may
     be a potential problem with all window managers.

The only potential problems I can see is if one of the windows happens
to be coming up while fvwm is traversing the window list capturing the
windows (so it wouldn't be in the window list) and didn't get a
notification that a new window appeared (why, I don't know).  I'll
look through the code and see if there is anything glaring (which I
doubt - if there is a bug it'll be a subtle one).

Also, I imagine that a 'Recapture' should pick those windows up again.

[1] doesn't fix it. I call fvwm near the begining of my xsession, but I still 
see this.  And as for [2], I don't start anything that I consider 
heavyweight from either initfunction or .xsession (xterms, xclock, xload, set a
bg pic...).

I mentioned this bug a few weeks ago, but never got a satisfactory answer. 
A workaround is not a fix.  I see the problem consistantly on our solaris2.4
boxes (with AFS, so that slows things down), and I really can't see pushing 
fvwm2 into production in our environment until this is fixed.

No doubt it sucks; race conditions do.

A question:

How can I make a menu appear on a GoodStuff/FvwmButtons menu 
button AND have different menus for each mouse button?  I have 
the following already:

	*FvwmButtons Telnets whatever   Popup "Telnets"

but I want one menu for left-button, another for middle, and 
Telnets for right.  Is it possible?

I didn't see it in the docs but I seem to remember someone 
talking about it before.

Along those same lines, I've been wondering about something: can 
GoodStuff/FvwmButtons be configured so that a button BOTH swallows an app 
at startup _AND_ launches a different app when clicked?

I've just done sample implementation, to apply configure's feature to
fvwm-2.0.38 in last weekend. This implementation does replace 'Do it
yourself OS supporting stuff' section of configure.h. It does NOT do
configure where to install, where is the XPM library, which feature to
select, and so on. This MUST BE done by Imakefile or by
user. configure must support OS specific library existence check ONLY.

Well, I found that libs/strncmp.c is the source of mystrncasecmp(). So
I think it should be renamed to libs/mystrncasecmp.c. This renaming
causes Imakefile (SRCS= section) also.

In recent makefile.h says:

	#if defined(SunArchitecture) && OSMajorVersion > 5

Is it typo of

	#if defined(SunArchitecture) && OSMajorVersion > 4

or

	#if defined(SunArchitecture) && OSMajorVersion >= 5

?

Sun has already released SunOS 6.0 or so ?

I dont know about the fvwmbuttons stuff but I have different actions
bound for each mouse button to the title bar buttons. Or at least I
have two different actions thus:

Mouse 1         3       A     	Close
Mouse 2         3       A     	Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse 3         3       A     	Menu Window-Ops2 Close

Note that this works on title bar button 3, which for historical reasons is my
default top left button.

content-length: 1696

For all those interested in this problem I was having, I have found that it
must be the way in which I am starting FVWM that causes the error. To
refresh memories, the error was that if I launched an xterm from a menu
item in my .fvwmrc file, I would get an invalid argument error when xterm
had no errors. There was nothing on the rest of the line in my .fvwmrc file
so that was not it.

I decided that it must be some thing in my .fvwmrc file because other
people here could start xterms. I started removing lines from my .fvwmrc
file and restarting, hoping that I would eventually eliminate the mystery
line. Nothing seemed to work so I started again but this time "killing"
FVWM and restarting it from the command line. The first time I did this
everything worked. I then put my original .fvwmrc file back in place and
again it all worked. I have therefore concluded that it is how I start the
window manager that is causing me problems. The problem with this is that
it is all part of some complex scripts designed to provide all users with a
common environment across herogeneous platforms.

If I can find out the exact problem I will let people know. Sorry for
leading everybody on a wild goose chase with the previous posts.

I have recently switched to FVWM from MWM. One thing I really liked about
MWM was that through an Xresource I could specify a threshold for moves. If
the cursor did not move more than this threshold then the button down was
considered a click, not a drag.

Is there anything like this for FVWM? I find that when I bring my windows
to the front with the Move-Raise functions I always end up moving the
window as well.

Thanks,

I thought it had been decided (maybe in my own head, and I never said so),
that fvwm is Fred's Virtual Window manager. Now the question would be:

No, I believe it's a typo.  I'll see about getting it fixed for pl39.

The words "invalid argument" come frequently from stty running in your
.bashrc or .bash_profile (or maybe the system wide ones).

It happens when stty is run, but its parent is not connected to a
tty. The following demonstrates:

When I startup "dclock", and move my mouse over the window, the border 
does not change color, as a sign of focus change. If the dclock is very near
an xterm then I can move from the xterm to the dclock and the focus is still
in the xterm. This is very odd behaviour. Other WM's do not have this 
problem. Any ideas?

Programs like clocks and xloads do not accept the keyboard focus -- they
can (and do) tell this to the window manager so that the window manager 
doesn't waste time or effort dumping characters down the bit bucket!

This is actually a desirable feature that ONLY FVWM has. I suspect that you
have enabled SloppyFocus policy and have the Style for dclock to include
ClickFocus. 

What this means to the user is that:

Sytle: The only way to get focus in a clickFocus window is to actually
click on it. The rationale behind this is that there are certain windows
(clocks, xloads etc) that you do not want to get focus arbitrarily when the
pointer moves over it.

SloppyFocus: when the pointer moves from a window onto the root window (or
a window with click focus) the focus stays in the window you are
leaving. This is a really great feature because you can be working in a
window and have the mouse bumped and you will still be typing in the window
you think you are.

I beleive the sample .fvwmrc files set this behaviour. Look for the
following lines in your .fvwmrc file if you do not like the behaviour.

Style "*lock"       NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip,ClickToFocus
Style "*"           SloppyFocus

Thanks for this very nice reply, however this is not the problem/feature.

I do not have ClickToFocus set anywhere, and infact clicking on the dclock
does not do any good. For that matter I do not have SloppyFocus set anywhere
either. This truely looks like a bug to me. The mouse buttons do what
they are supposed to though over the dclock, it is just the keyboard
that either does not respond or responds in another window.

I saw an fvwm screen shot on the web that had decorated title bars
that had horizontal lines running through them similar to the way that
mac title bars look.  Does anyone know how to do this under 1.24 or is
this a fvwm.pre-2.0 feature?

You probably saw a screenshot of mine

(http://www.ssc.com/~roland/other/screens.html)

The striated title bars are how the Sticky windows appear, so I 
hacked borders.c to do this for all windows. This was in pre2.0 something 
or other, its a real simple hack, just remove the check if the window is 
sticky or not

This is true, but not of dclock.  Dclock uses keystrokes for various 
things, for instance, 'q' to quit, 's' to display seconds, and 'd' to 
display the date.

Incidentally, I don't notice the anomalous behaviour described by the 
original poster.  Perhaps a compiler bug?

I've always used ordinary pointer focus, even before I started using
fvwm. When I used mwm (or 4dwm, or even twm, for that matter) with
pointer focus, I could move the pointer into an xload or xclock
window, then execute window manager commands using the keyboard.
Fvwm has never allowed me to issue keyboard-bound WM commands to those
two clients, and I've been using fvwm since version 1.20. It's
something that's always irked me, but never enough to *really*
complain. :-) Whenever I've wanted to terminate one of those two
clients through fvwm commands, I've always had to pick "close" or
"delete" from my root menu, then click on the window in question. With
any other window manager I've used, I just moved the pointer into the
window and pressed alt-f4: the window closes.

Of course, my setup could be screwy. In fact, it is -- I do some heavy
m4 processing on it before passing it to fvwm. But even before I
started using m4 on my .fvwmrc file, fvwm acted this way. Now I see
I'm not the only one to experience this behavior. Fvwm behaves in this
situation for me as it does for Randall Winchester. If I move the
pointer into, say, my xclock, it doesn't receive the focus, regardless
of whether or not another window had the focus beforehand.

So, I'm right back where I (and others) have started. What causes this
behavior? As I said, it's probably something in my setup. I know I
make those clients sticky with no titles or borders, and I remove them
from the window list and circulation list. (I'm going by my memory; my
setup is at work and I'm writing this from home.) Could any of those
attributes contribute to this condition? I don't have explicit focus
enabled for anything in my setup -- just a 'style "*" pointerfocus' at
the top of my styles.

  I had to fix this for sxpm once.  The problem exists for all Xt based
  programs that initialize the top level shell like this:

    toplevel = 
      XtInitialize (name,
                    "DClock",
                    options,
                    XtNumber(options),
                    &argc,
                    argv);

  as the XtNinput resource will be set to False, by default, and FVWM will
  not pass any input to to that program, as the ICCM requires.  I believe
  that FVWM maybe the only WM that complies to this requirement.

  To fix this add to dclock.c, an include for

     #include <X11/Shell.h>

  change the line that declares:
    Arg arg;
  to
    Arg arg[1];

  and add, after the call to initialize, the following two lines:

    XtSetArg (arg[0], XtNinput, True);
    XtSetValues (toplevel, arg, 1);

  That ought to do it.

the source code of Fvwm 2.0pl37 does not compile on a DEC Station 5000 with
the 3.0 version of the DEC C compiler. The linker complains that it cannot
resolve the function  strdup() which is used in envvar.c in the libs
directory. I don't know if the source of Fvwm should be ANSI compatible,
but if yes, it is not as the strdup() function is not part of ANSI.

If this problem is solved in a more recent version of Fvwm, please ignore
this mail. Otherwise, please give some suggestions (apart from implementing
the function strdup() myself, or using GCC and associates) on how to solve
this.

Kind regards,

Kees.

Just because it uses keystrokes doesn't mean that the program was set up 
correctly. Use xprop to find out for sure.

The dclock probably has set the hint :

WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
                Client accepts input or input focus: False
 
xclock does this, so I bet dclock does too.

This means that the clock should not ever get the keyboard focus. Most window
managers ignore this property, because a number of applications set it
incorrectly. So, fvwm tried to move the focus from an xterm to the clock,
but found that the clock did not want focus. At this point one could argue
about whether the focus should move to root or back to the xterm, but I don't
think that it matters much. If want the standard broken behavior (give focus to
the clock), then you need to set 
Style "*" Lenience
or just
Lenience
depending on which version of fvwm you have.

bruin> The linker complains that it cannot resolve the function
bruin> strdup() which is used in envvar.c in the libs directory.

That's right. Current FVWM (and modules) source assumes the existence
of following function related to string operation:

	strdup(), strncmp(), strstr(), strtol(), putenv()

My using-GNU-configure approach solves this problem, by adding
supplemental source to libs/ directory (which library sources come
from FreeBSD-2.0.5-RELEASE). Well, here is a patch of my poor work. If
you interested, check it and give me back some comments. I made this
patch (attached below) against to vanilla fvwm-2.0.38, then gzipped
and uuencoded.

This patch contains:

	+ files to make 'configure' script.
		configure.in
	+ files to make 'configure.h.in'.
		configure.h.{top,bot}
	+ 'configure' script which is made by autoconf
	+ 'configure.h.in' file which is made by autoheader
	+ additional files for libfvwm
		libs/{strdup,strstr,strtol,putenv}.c
	+ rename libs/strncmp.c to libs/mystrcasecmp.c and
	  additional libs/strncmp.c which supports strncmp()
	+ diffs for files which is already exists.
		fvwm/misc.h, libs/Imakefile,
		libs/{hostname,mygetostype,sleep}.c
		modules/FvwmBacker/FvwmBacker.c
		modules/FvwmConfig/WinBase.cc
		modules/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.c
		modules/FvwmWinList/FvwmWinList.c

Once you do a 'patch' to fvwm-2.0.38,

	+ If you ONLY wanna do configure and how it works, first
	  remove following bogus files.
		configure.h.{top,bot} configure.in
	+ do 'chmod +x configure'
	+ execute 'configure', and see what's done.
	  configure script makes 'configure.h' file.
	+ do edit configure.h as usual
	+ do xmkmf or so, as usual

If you cannot run configure script, copy configure.h.in simply to
configure.h, and modify GNU autoconf stuff.

Howdy all.

For those of you having problems w/ windows not getting the keyboard
focus, try something like the following (2.xx):

Style "*" Lenience

and that should take care of your problem.  From the man page:

          The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property

               WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
                               Client accepts input or input focus: False

          should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window
          manager.  These windows can take the input focus by
          themselves, however. A number of applications set this
          property, and yet expect the window-manager to give them the
          keyboard focus anyway, so fvwm provides a window-style,
          "Lenience", which will allow fvwm to overlook this ICCCM
          rule.

This has been in there since 1.xx (only there it was a global setting).

Chuck

I also use "stripes" for all the title bars at my site. I have sent 
this out before... What I do instead for Sticky windows is to give them
their own color in .fvwm2rc like;
Style "xconsole"    Sticky, Color Black/#60c0a0

Here is the patch against fvwm-2.0.38, but it is the same for all of them;

I just got up and running under fvwm 2.0  pl 38 and have the 
following interesting problem.

If I start an xterm from the cmd line everything works fine.

If I start one from a menu option, when I get output from a shell 
program (lets say...ls) it freezes. (i.e. I get no output).  At first 
I just thought my NFS server was timing out, but latter I found out 
that the output is being frozen until I generate an X event.  

So if I do an ls -l I end up with nothing, until I move the cursor 
outside of the window. (then I get output).

Also, If I have a continuous stream of output it will pause after 
every X event.  So it looks like the X event only flushes the current 
buffer, and doesn't clear it up permenantly.

My xterm is created with the following command:

+               "small"      Exec exec xterm -geo 80x30 &

The following (simple) patch to FvwmWinList corrects a refresh problem apparent
on my Sun SPARCStation 20. (It appears to be a timing problem, in that it did
not appear on an HP system).

It also appears to correct the repositioning problem that FvwmWinList had (it
wandered from its assigned position as the window list changed).

This ist fine.  But why does the fvwm pager (at least in version
1.24r) not do the same ?  Are there any special keyboard functions
only possible, when the pager has the keyboard-focus ?  Using fvwms
'sloppyfocus' would be a lot more useful, if the the pager wouldn't 
grap the keyboard focus away from the previous window.

What I want is for GoodStuff/FvwmButtons to swallow one app, but launch 
another on click.

For example, I can have GoodStuff swallow "coolmail", an xbiff. When I 
click on the swallowed "coolmail", it (coolmail) launches my mail reader. 
Unfortunately, not every swallowable program has this kind of behavior. 
I'd like to have GoodStuff _not_ pass the click events to the swallowed 
program, but rather interpret them itself.

What I want is to take an application like "xdaliclock" that's been 
swallowed, and have GoodStuff launch ANOTHER app (maybe plan or 
xcalendar) when I click the button.
