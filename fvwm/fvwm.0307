I have a couple of curious fvwm-related problems which, after lengthy
examination, I am still unable to solve.


I use sirc as my IRC client, and icbm as my ICB client.  Both clients
are written in Perl, and both have the ability (via Perl functions
loaded from their startup files) to launch external applications.  In
particular, I commonly launch Xcoral, a graphical programming editor,
from both in order to edit their configuration files on the fly while
running (both can reload their configuration on the fly).

In icbm or sirc sessions started while running fvwm-1.24r, this works
perfectly.  If I start the clients under fvwm-1.24r and then switch to
fvwm-2.4.16, I can still launch Xcoral from within either.  But if the
clients were launched while fvwm-2.4.16 is running, all attempts to
launch xcoral or any other application that creates a window from within
either sirc or icbm silently fail, even if I switch bach to fvwm-1.24r  
and try to launch them.  However, executing any external command that
does not create a window still works.

Also, I use procmeter3 to monitor system status.  If started from 
fvwm-1.24r's InitFunction, it works perfectly.  If started from an Xterm 
while fvwm-2.4.16 is running, it works perfectly.  If started from 
fvwm-2.4.16's InitFunction, it loads and draws its window correctly, but 
none of its modules ever receive any data.


I have dumped and diffed the environment of a login and non-login shell
under both fvwm-1.24 and fvwm-2.4.16, and there is no significant
difference.  Witness the following diff:


babylon5:alaric:~:3 $ diff -U3 env*

As you can see, the only difference is the addition of FVWM_USERDIR and
FVWM_MODULEDIR to the environment by fvwm2.  The data for this
comparison was generated by the following two-line shell script, invoked
from InitFunction in each case:

#!/bin/bash
env > $1


Does anyone at all have any insight whatsoever as to the cause of these
problems?  I like the features of fvwm2, not least that window gravity
seems to work properly in fvwm2, but functional problems like this that
actually break the functioning of totally unrelated apps are really on
the verge of driving me back to fvwm1.  Sure, I like being able to have
marble-textured window decorations, but that's worthless if the
applications in the windows don't work because of something the window
manager is doing.

(Oh, and what's with fvwm2 on Solaris defaulting to utterly and totally
 ignoring ALL user window-manager configuration?)

You didn't show any configuration, like definition of your InitFunction
or commands you use in sirc to open other application windows.

Please do this simple test. Start your fvwm-2.4.16 using this command:

  fvwm -c "AddToFunc InitFunction I Exec exec xterm -e sirc"

(place it into ~/.xinitrc or the equivalent)
Does sirc work like you expect even if started from InitFunction?

If yes, post your entire .fvwm2rc and we will try to find an error.
If no, try to do more experiments with a mininal configuration.

Please explain this question.

Do you mean Sun (or sysadmin) patched fvwm to ignore ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
configuration file or something else?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry for the omission.  I didn't include my InitFunction because I
wasn't starting sirc from InitFunction, and because the problem with
procmeter3 didn't seem specific to InitFunction -- the procmeter3
problem occurs whenever procmeter3 is started from fvwm2 by any means.

An example definition for sirc is as follows:

    my $rcdir = $ENV{'HOME'}.'/.sirc';

    sub cmd_edit
    {
        my $cmd = sprintf ('/usr/local/bin/xcoral %s &', $args);
        system ($cmd);
    }
    &addcmd("edit");

    &docommand("^alias rc edit ~/.sirc/sircrc.pl");


The equivalent definition for icbm is almost identical:

    my $rcdir = $ENV{'HOME'}.'/.icbm';

    sub edit
    {
        my $cmd = sprintf ('/usr/local/bin/xcoral %s &', @_);
        system ($cmd);
    }
    &addcmd('edit');

    &alias ('rc',   "edit $rcdir/commands");

This actually doesn't replicate my situation, because I'm not starting
sirc directly.  I open an xterm, and from that xterm I run a Perl script
which forks off a series of child processes, each of which spawns an
xterm and starts an sirc or icbm instance in it.  Normally I do not do
this from InitFunction because usually, when I log in and start fvwm, my
dialup isn't connected yet and there's no servers available for sirc or
icbm to connect to.  I also hadn't tried putting that script into
InitFunction because when I tried running the script from a menu in
fvwm-1.24r, it didn't work, and I was never able to figure out why.  The
script executed, but no windows ever appeared.

However, in accordance with your instructions, I tried adding the
following to InitFunction:

+		"I" Exec exec /home/alaric/bin/geek

And to my surprise, not only did it work, but the icbm and sirc
instances it started could launch external windowed apps without any
problems.  This mystifies me even more -- starting procmeter3 from
InitFunction breaks it, but running bin/geek from InitFunction makes
sirc and icbm work right?  Most peculiar, Holmes.

Based on this, I then tried adding my front-end script to an fvwm menu
as follows:

AddToMenu RootMenu	"Desktop Menu"	Title
+			"Geek!"		Exec exec /home/alaric/bin/geek

This worked too.  So, it seems whatever the problem is, I can work
around it (so long as I don't want to specify additional options) by
starting my front-end from fvwm; this still doesn't tell me what the
problem is, though, or enable me to start from an xterm and have
launching work.  It just occurred to me to try entering the command
using FvwmTalk, though, and that too works and yields a chat window from
which I can spawn windowed applications.

I've tried a few variations on these various themes trying to find a
similar workaround to the problem with procmeter3, with no success.
That's still a complete mystery to me.


> If yes, post your entire .fvwm2rc and we will try to find an error.
> If no, try to do more experiments with a mininal configuration.

Attached.  I've also included my front-end script for starting icbm and
sirc in case it sheds any clues.

I take it this is NOT an expected occurrence.  Allow me to clarify,
therefore:

I downloaded fvwm-2.4.16 source and used it to build fvwm2 for this
machine (an Athlon XP1800 running a heavily-updated, Slackware-7.0-based
Linux).  I then performed a make distclean and used the exact same
source code, with as close as applicable to the exact same configuration
options, to build fvwm2 on an Ultra30 running Solaris 9.

The fvwm2 installation built on Linux honors all user configuration
files automatically, and just Does The Right Thing.  The fvwm2 built on
the Solaris machine defaults to ignoring all user configuration files
unless explicitly started as 'fvwm2 -f $HOME/.fvwm2rc'.  

I take it from your response this is not supposed to happen.  Is it
possible that the prior presence of the Sunfreeware fvwm-2.4.5 package
on the machine while configuring fvwm-2.4.16 (I removed the fvwm-2.4.5
package before fvwm-2.4.16's make install) could have an influence on
this?

Hi!

I'm running fvwm 2.4.15 and I don't know how to make Gaim (ver 0.64) not 
to popup at every received message. I try using:
	Style "Gaim*" GrabFocusOff GrabFocusTransientOff
but didn't work. :-(

Can somebody help me with this problem?

According to what FvwmIdent says about gaim, it seems to take the
focus itself.  In this case, there is little you can do.  Identify
the exact name of the annoying popups (with FvwmIdent if
necessary) and try

  Style <window_name> GrabFocusOff, GrabFocusTransientOff, NeverFocus

Hi!

I have some memory of seeing this question before on the list, but I
couldn't find it in the archives. Sorry if I didn't searched enough.

I have a few Sticky windows which has the NoTitle Style. My question if
it's possible to configure FvwmPager so that it doesn't display the
WindowTitle on these windows?

Regards,

Hi folks,

I would suggest to use "cc -E $CFLAGS" instead of "cc -E" during
configure. $CFLAGS might contain some -I flags pointing to include
directories to search for xpm.h or png.h, for example.

Harri

What is the actual problem?

I have no time to test it now, but I would think all of these may work:

  CFLAGS="-O5 -g" ./configure --something
  CC="cc -E -O5 -g" ./configure --something
  ./configure --something CFLAGS="-O5 -g"
  ./configure --something CC="cc -E -O5 -g"

This value should be propagated to "make", but you may also specify CC or
CFLAGS for the make stage separately, like:

  make something CFLAGS="-O5 -g"

See also INSTALL.fvwm for other hints (including Solaris).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm installing Debian unstable and the latest GNOME2 desktop on a
friend's system, and I'm trying to convince him to see the light and
switch from sawfish to fvwm2.  However I'm running into a few bugs with
the GNOME2 integration.  I'm using a freshly built fvwm 2.5.7.

I switch to fvwm by killing sawfish and running fvwm2, then saving my
session.  The first time after I log out and log back in with fvwm, the
GNOME menu panel, which is always at the top of the screen, has been
relocated to the bottom of the screen.  The bottom edge panel has been
relocated to the top of the screen.  The menu panel cannot be moved.  If
I move the bottom edge panel down to the bottom of the screen where it
belongs, it gets hidden behind the menu panel, and is lost forever.

If I switch back to sawfish, the next time I log in the panels are in
the right place.

A second bug is that when using fvwm, and the workspace applet in the
GNOME panel, I always have 4 workspaces.  I would like to only have one
workspace.  But if I change the number of workspaces in the applet, it
always gets reset to 4 when I log in again.

Are these known bugs?

Thanks,
--Tessa

You want $(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS) (where $(CPP) is often autodetected by
configure as being cc -E).

$(CPPFLAGS) should *not* need to be passed to $(CC); if users need flags
that are passed when preprocessing *and* compiling, they should prepend
$(CPPFLAGS) to $(CFLAGS) themselves.

Hi, 

Congratulations for the Birthday !

I used fvwm 4 years ago for the first and 
I nevert left it. I particularly appreciate
that it is fast and flexible 
and the quality of the documentation
which is really instructive. 

I have conviced two of my friends to 
use FVWM and they don't regret their choice !

Thank you for your the good job,
Laurent.

hi.

Is there a way to make Fvwm WindowList behave just like windows in screen? (the
terminal program). There are several options to control the dynamic
generation of the windowlist (like iconified at end, current and end ...)
but i don't find a way to fix the window's positions.

this would be a huge advantage, because one could always access a window
using the same number/letter in the windowlist. each window should have
a fixed number/letter in the windowlist. if a window with a lower
number or letter is closed, the number can be reused by newer windows
instead of decreasing the numbers/letters of all other windows.

this is exactly how screen handles its windows. is there a way to make
the WindowList behave like that?

thanks, bye :)

Is this problem occur only the first time you log back?

The problem was that configure wasn't smart enough to find
xpm.h and some other headers, even though CFLAGS contained
"-I/usr/local/include" pointing to the right directory.

Currently I am using

	export IMLIBCONF=/usr/local/bin/imlib-config
	export GTK_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/gtk-config
	export CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
	export LDFLAGS"=-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
	export CC="cc $CFLAGS $LDFLAGS"
	export CPP="$CC -E"
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/fvwm-2.5.7
	make

Please note that I am _not_ using gcc. Standard gcc looks
in /usr/local/include by default, even if you installed
it somewhere else.

Well, the CFLAGS are not supposed to contain preprocessor flags.
You should put them in the CPPFLAGS variable.

No.  It happens every other time.  I logged out and logged in six
times.  On attempts #1, 3, and 5, the menu panel was on the bottom.  On
attempts #2, 4, and 6, the menu panel was on the top.  It flipped from
one end of the screen to the other every time I logged in.

Hello all. I'm starting galeon in /etc/X11/Xsession.d and am
having a little problem : the galeon window is aligned with the
right and bottom edges of the screen, not top left.

Here's the Xsession command :

  galeon -d -g 864x820+0+0

The relevant bits of the ~/.fvwm/post.hook :

  Style "*" SloppyFocus
  Style "*" TileCascadePlacement
  Style "xosview@*" Sticky
  # You can't control on which page Galeon starts with the
  # --geometry option so we have to do it here.
  Style "*galeon*" SkipMapping,		\
		   NoPPosition,		\
		   NoUSPosition,	\
		   StartsOnPage 1 1

I tried galeon -g 864x820, 864x820+0+0, 864x820+1152+864, Style
with or without NoPPosition/NoUSPosition, but no joy. Anyone
understands what's happening ?

Hello, 

it is a little bit wired !!!

I have tried all to versions and it works... 

I use wdm on one of my Workstations and I start uprecords in a xterm 
under the WDM Login Dialog... ;-)) 

It is spanned by the WDM startup-script where I set the DPMS and CAM. 

The process of xterm/uprecords is owned ba root, but if I log in, 
I can kill it while moving the mouse over it and press <Ctrl>C or with 
the two scripts above... 

It is MY DESK and not root's !!!

So I do what I want ;-))

Michelle

The problem is, that I miss ALL Messages between 

        Date: Fri, 20 Jun 2003 13:48:30 +1000
and
        Date: Mon, 23 Jun 2003 21:16:59 -0400

not only my own posts and the mailinglist offers no option to resend 
all messages between this two Date's 

Thanke
Michelle

You can not specify a position and StartsOnPage + SkipMapping at
the same time.  I will make a patch for the next releases (2.4.17
and 2.5.8).  Note that "NoPPosition, NoUSPosition" negates the
effect of specifying a geometry for the window.

fvwm folks

I am having a problem with FvwmIconMan. With the configuration below
(with work in a previus version of fvwm) I get the following problem -
the buttons only show up in the manager if the window is not iconic -
if the window is iconified the button disappes from the manager

from .fvwm2rc


*FvwmIconMan: managergeometry 5x3
*FvwmIconMan: font -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmIconMan: resolution page
*FvwmIconMan: ButtonGeometry 60x0
*FvwmIconMan: action      Mouse   1 N sendcommand "Iconify"
*FvwmIconMan: action      Mouse   2 N sendcommand "Iconify 1"
*FvwmIconMan: action      Mouse   3 N sendcommand "FvwmIdent"


fvwm version

(localhost)% fvwm -version
FVWM version 2.4.15 compiled on Feb 20 2003 at 13:08:43
with support for: ReadLine, Stroke, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM, Xinerama


but the same config works for 2.4.8

thanks

I see no such problem in 2.4.15, 2.4.16 and the latest development
version.  Please post your full configuration file and step by
step instructions to reproduce the problem.

FvwmBacker seems to be the module of choice for setting different
backgrounds per desk.  It appears that one could also use FvwmEvent with
new_desk.  What is the tradeoff?  Is one approach more efficient than the
other?

Thanks. Since I'm not entirely sure I'm being clear, I'd like to
expound my story a bit :

- NoPPosition was only added as an attempt to get the Galeon
  window to align as expected (i.e. close to the top left corner),

- NoUSPosition and +0+0 were only added because NoPPosition had no
  effect (or at least not the expected effect).

Basically I'm trying to get Galeon to open a 864x820 window in the
top left corner of page (1,1). Sounds simple, but the Galeon +
FVWM combination is not being cooperative.

Since I've got home from work, things have got even weirder : FVWM
now does active placement on Galeon ! A possible reason is that
~/.galeon is shared between the two machines. Galeon has this
thing about restoring the last window size and position it had.
But the two machines have different display sizes (1600x1200 vs.
1152x864)...

Tried to trace Galeon but ltrace is useless. galeon-bin forks,
child dies, galeon-bin forks again, child dies, galeon-bin forks a
third time, child just sits there in T state. It's not just slow,
it's hung. ltrace and parent are sleeping. No CPU is consumed by
anyone.

FvwmBacker is specialized to change the root window dynamically.
It supports setting solid color or colorset or call external command.
It supports an easy syntax to specify different backgrounds for different
pages/desks.

On the other hand FvwmEvent is designed to fire all existing events when
requested, not just new_desk and not just change background on new_desk.
It does not include any special support except for optional sound support
using rplay.

The only way you may emulate FvwmBacker using FvwmEvent is when you use
external command to change your background regardless of the current
page/desk or pass this info to external script for processing. In this
case there is no much difference, but FvwmBacker is a bit preferable.

Mikhael.

I am also experiencing problems with galeon placement: whenever I launch

galeon -g XdimxYdim+Xoff+Yoff

the dimension is respected whereas the offset is completely ignored.

I use fvwm 2.5.4 and I _always_ had this problem since I started to use 
galeon , even with previous version of fvwm.

Try

  Style galeon UsePPosition

The galon window still ends up in odd locations if you use
negative coordinates.  For example, if you start it with

  $ galeon -g -0-0

it does not appear in the bottom right corner, but in the top left
corner of the page to the bottom right of the current page :-P
They seem to forget to set the proper gravity.

If you ask me, galeon's placement is broken completely.  Report
this to the galeon developers.

I'm sure FvwmEvent could be used here as well to capture the window and
move it.... *that* answer is in the FAQ :)

Hi all, 
  I'm using fvwm 2.5.5 and find that whenever I open a new window I have to
  click it to make it focused. This is very annoying.

  Is there a easy way to make new windows get focused when show up?
  I guess it results in some configurations I put in my fvwm2rc (copied
  from others, but can not figure out where is the problem).

  Thanks in advance.

If you need to click to windows to get them focused then remove this line
from your configuration:

  Style * ClickToFocus

The default focus policy is MouseFocus, you may try SloppyFocus too.
And try GrabFocus for new windows to get focus even if they are not under
the mouse pointer.

If you have a lot of settings and don't know which ones may affect your
focus policy search for "Focus" or "FP" in your configuration and either
comment these commands out or contact the man page to read what they mean.

Regards,
Mikhael.

i am a beginner trying to use fvwm.  when i start it
up, a background flashes (a pic  of a galaxy) then it
changes to a splattered gray background.  how does one
go about changing this gray background to something
they like better, or the previous one that dissappears
in a flash?

thanks for your time,

   I like chbg, unrelated to fvwm, you don't have to have your WM to 
change the root window picture. There are other programs as well (check 
your distro or freshmeat), you can start any of them from X startup 
scripts (probably ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession)

   there's also FvwmBacker module that makes it possible to have 
different backgrounds on different virtual screens

Hello, everyone,

I've been lurking for a while now, and have the following question:

I put a picture on the root window via the following:

xv -rmode 5 -quit -root ~/bgrounds/hchaos.png

I also start a transparent aterm via .xinitrc

now, the problem is that the transparent aterm doesn't acquire the root
image on startup.  If I place it on the .xinitrc file, It acquires the gray
pattern typical of a plain X root window.  If I place it on the .fvwm2rc
file, it catches a black background.  I figure that this has to do with the
time that it takes to load the image, but I have no clue how to synchronize
or otherwise make sure that the aterm acquires the right background.  Any
ideas on how could I solve this?

I don't have aterm so I cannot test this, but try executing
fvwm-root -d following xv, as in:

xv -rmode 5 -quit -root ~/bgrounds/hchaos.png; fvwm-root -d

In ~/.xinitrc, try sleeping for a while before starting aterm...

  xv -quit -root <image> && sleep 2

The idea is ok, but the example lines are incorrect.
As it is written (running xv in foreground) it wastes 2 sec for nothing.
This would be more correct:

  (xv -quit -root <image> && aterm) &

Or:

  xv -quit -root <image> &
  (sleep 3 && aterm) &

Mikhael.

Look in your .xinitrc, .xsession, etc as well as .fvwm2rc.  Also look in
the system Xsession, xinitrc, etc.  You may have to hunt some to find
them, and not knowing what you're running, I don't know where to tell
you to look (though the system files are most likely in either /etc/X11 
or /usr X11R6/lib).

>From what you're describing, something in the X11 startup chain is
loading a galaxy image as a background image, and then moments later,
something *else* is setting the default X/11 dithered 50% gray
background.  (Yes, it's unspeakably hideous, but it's the default
because it works even on a 1-bit display.)  Find where the image and the
dithered background are being set, disable the dithered gray, and you
should be set.  Better still, create your own .xsession file (assuming
you don't already have one, and assuming you're using a display manager
that honors it) and set up whatever you want in there.

I use "wmsetbg" to set the desktop background. It seems to
set the background in a different way to xv or fvwm-root
since it changes the background of aterm, gnome-terminal
automatically. 
It seems also to be stronger than xv and fvwm-root:

aterm -tr
wmsetbg image1.jpg
# aterm bg changes to image1.jpg
fvwm-root image2.jpg
# aterm still got image1.jpg
gnome-terminal --transparent
# gnome-terminal uses image1.jpg as background

Hi everyone, new to the list, been using fvwm for +- 6 months and loving
it. I have a problem with an image used as a SidePic being too short for
my menu. I use the option :

MenuStyle * SidePic /home/stu/.fvwm/images/buttons/knot_vert.xpm

Unfortunately the image begins halfway down my menu and ends at the
bottom. I would like the image to start at the top of my menu and end at
the bottom. Other than using a longer image each time I lengthen my menu
(and presumably a shorter image if I shorten my menu), which would be
ridiculous, How would I 'tile' an image down the side of my menu, so
that no matter what length my menu is, the side picture always fills
the whole side (similar to the way TitleStyle works) ?

Thanks

This would be a future invocation like, but currently fvwm-root does not
suport jpg. Supposing this is a type, you should use:

  fvwm-root -r image2.png

> # aterm still got image1.jpg
> gnome-terminal --transparent

Then these terminals should use image2.png, I guess.

I don't think that currently it is possible to align the side menu image
to the top or to tile it. Maybe in the future we will have a colorset for
the side rectangle, but not now.

Okay, I did not try it with fvwm-root. To be sure I have
tried it now with

    convert image.jpg image.xpm
    fvwm-root image.xpm

But the result is the same.

Just have a try ;-) You will see that gnome-applications as
gnome-terminal still use the old background.

Hi!

Usually, I set my backgrounds with fvwm-root. Doing this, transparency
doesn't seem to work. Setting the root picture with nautilus causes the
colorset to be transparent.

Below what's in my config. I am not usin fvwm-themes.

---
Colorset 41 RootTransparent buffer
Colorset 42 RootTransparent buffer, tint white 15

[...]

+ TitleStyle Active Colorset 41 -- flat

MenuStyle * MenuColorset 42

Hi, 
   I am customizing FvwmTaskBar so it looks and works like Win9x.
   Two problems:
      1. There is always a one pixel border around FvwmTaskBar, how to get
      rid of it?
      2. How to minimize an active window when clicking on its
      corresponding button on FvwmTaskBar?
      For example, when I first click a window on FvwmTaskBar with
      button1 that window should be brought to front. And if I click
      that button again using button1 I want that window get minimized
      (just like win9x).
      How to achieve this? 

   Here is my FvwmTaskBar configuration (not work fine) I can only make
   window active using mouse button1 but can not iconify them with
   button1:

    AddToFunc DeiconifyRaiseAndFocus
    + I Iconify off
    + I Raise
    + I Focus

    AddToFunc ToggleIconify
    + I Current [AcceptsFocus] Iconify
    + I Current [!AcceptsFocus] Raise,Focus

    Style  "FvwmTaskBar"	NoTitle, Sticky, NoHandles
    Style  "FvwmTaskBar"	StaysOnTop, FixedSize, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip
    *FvwmTaskBar: Action Click1 DeiconifyRaiseAndFocus
    *FvwmTaskBar: Action Click3 Iconify true,  Lower
    *FvwmTaskBar: Action Click2 Iconify false, Raise

I find SloppyFocus does not work as I expect. However, GrabFocus works
fine.

Yes you did, I have overseen it. But the result is the same,

Do you run "fvwm-root --retain-pixmap" (or -r for short) as explained in
the RootTransparent documentation?

Works for me. gnome-terminal does not support --transparent any more,
but --window-with-profile transparent (after creating profile) works.
aterm -tr automatically changes its background after "fvwm-root -r" too.

Why, sleep only if xv succeeds before starting aterm?

I gathered from OP that aterm was starting before xv could do its
thing.  So there should be some reasonable wait before aterm starts.
(See below before replying to this point.)


> This would be more correct:
> 
>   (xv -quit -root <image> && aterm) &

If for some reason, xv fails there would be /no/ aterm.  This would
be the least "correct" thing to do.


>   xv -quit -root <image> &
>   (sleep 3 && aterm) &

I like this much better than the above two versions for above
mentioned reasons.


Going off topic now...

I would change the last line to either of...

  sleep 3 && aterm &
  { sleep 3; aterm; } &


...Why start a sub shell, unless it is a shell specific workaround?

I want simulate vtwm title bar but i can't do it.

 in this screenshot  http://www.visi.com/~hawkeyd/graphics/vtwm-sheol.png we can see a title bar with 2 colors, gray and green, but i can't put 
same colors in my fvwm title bar.
example:
Colorset 0 fg white, bg gray, hi green
...
+ TitleStyle (Colorset 0 -- Raised)
...
but it is very ugly.

how do i write that in my fvwm2rc?. my fvwm is version 2.5.7.

thanks!!

Hi all,

I am using fvwm 2.5.7 on redhat 9 default installation with errata
up-to-dated. The kernel is 2.4.20-18.9.
When I right click onto my desktop, A menu shows up: 

FVWM Root Menu
Terminal
Top
Shell
Programms
Modules
Settings
Documents
ScreenSaver
Restart
Exit Fvwm

But when I clicked "Screen Saver", nothing happened.
How can I install a screen saver with password protect enabled on fvwm?

Thanks in advance.

It is impossible to emulate the short titlebar form.

It is possible to emulate colors, read about TitleStlye MultiPixmap in
the man page.

This is a non principal discussion, but xv does not reforks itself to
background from foreground, so if xv is finished no futher wait is ever
needed. At least "xv -quit" is transient, so this first problem is not
critical, but aterm is not, so a more important (second) problem in these
lines is a missing ampersand after aterm.

The subshell syntax is portable. As for the last 2 lines, different
shells do different things. The second line most certainly starts a new
shell if this syntax is supported at all. Even the first line starts a
new shell in some shells (bash, tcsh, but not zsh).

I've recently been writing up a new .fvwm2rc for a new machine and when
I got FvwmPager loaded, I came across a problem I've had in the past
where I didn't want my desktop to be 3x3. I knew there was a way to set
the size of the desktop, so I looked in the FvwmPager man page to no
avail. I also searched the fvwm2 man page; also to no avail.

So, I checked one of the sample .fvwm2rc's and found what I was looking
for: "DeskTopSize XxY". However, I still cannot find this in the
provided documentation. Shouldn't this option at least be in the fvwm2
man page? (Unwieldly as it is already.)

I personally think that if it is included in that man page, it should
also be referenced in the FvwmPager man page, since that's what alerted
me to wanting to change the desktop size.

Thanks!

I can find description of DeskTopSize in all man pages, at least starting
with 2.2. Do you search it correctly? What man page version do you read?

Ok, probably it should be mentioned in the synopsys.

You should have xlock or xscreensaver rpms installed on your system.

Then find a definition of your root menu and its submenus, probably in
the file ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc and then fix the entries that do not work.
Search the fvwm man page for the correct menu syntax.

You probably want something like this:

  AddToMenu MenuScreenSavers
  + "Screen Saver" Exec exec xlock -nolock
  + "Lock with password" Exec exec xlock -nice 19

It is also possible to create the screensaver menu automatically using
fvwm-menu-xlock script, read its man page.

Mikhael.

I have checked man pages installed with versions 2.4.15 and 2.4.16 like
so:

$ man fvwm2 | grep "DeskTopSize"
$ 

I suppose I could be searching the man pages incorrectly, though.

*Andy goes off to Google to see how to do this...*
*Andy returns...*

Ahh..

$ man fvwm2

then press / and type the term. Just /slightly/ simpler than my method
;-)

Thanks.

Not entierly incorrect as you would miss the stylized text.  Try...

  man fvwm2 | col -b | grep 'DeskTopSize'


...in this case, i prefer to see some context...

  man fvwm2 | col -b | fgrep -4 'DeskTopSize' | less

Hi,  I was wondering how to change backgrounds of the pages in fvwm, 
because

FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid black
FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid blue
FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid red
FvwmBackerDesk 3 -solid yellow

sets all 4 of my fvwm pages to black. Please direct me to a faq if 
there is one, I
know this is a basic question.

thanks,

gabe

Please mention the release you are using.
You are probably mixing up pages and desks.
Here is the syntax you want to use:

 *FvwmBacker: Command (Desk 0, Page 0 1) -solid midnightblue

Hi all,

I have translated fvwm rpm description into Vietnamese and very happy if
if you can put them into tmp-fvwm.spec. Here is the translation:

Sample spec file:

and rpm, srpms built with that spec:

http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/~vuhung/linux/fvwm/fvwm-2.5.7-2.src.rpm
http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/~vuhung/linux/fvwm/fvwm-debuginfo-2.5.7-2.i586.rpm

FYI: I made some changes to fvwm.spec.

Is there a module (or whatever) that supports tabbed multi-application
windows?  Fluxbox (I think) supports such a feature.  I've never used
it, but I suspect it might be addictive.

The idea is that multiple applications are grouped under a single window
decoration that provides a mechanism (such as tabs) to move between the
apps.

maybe the 2.4.15 fvwmbacker man pages didn't get installed with the rest
  of fvwm, but what I originally posted is what was in the man page.

But, I was referring to the other modules, too. Do people go to the 
headers,
or the module's config file parsing code, or is it more user friendly 
than that?

fvwm-2.5.7
Mandrake 9.1
XFree86-4.3

After upgrading to Mandrake 9.1, I've noticed that when I hit
<LeftAlt>+<Tab> the window list goes away as soon as I release <Tab>,
but if I hit <RightAlt>+<Tab> the window list stays up 'til I hit <Esc>
or select a window.  I've tried changing some seemingly relevant
settings in various files under /etc/X11 but nothing has had any effect.
Has anyone else experienced this?  Thanks much.

I haven't experienced this, but there are two things I can think of:

The first is that the right alt button, might be a modifier under fvwm.

The other thing to do is to use xmodmap to reflect the same behaviour as
the left alt key (xkeycaps comes in handy here).

Well, if I understand things correctly both left and right alt buttons
are supposed to be Meta keys and therefore modifiers.  The fact that
both <LeftAlt>+<Tab> and <RightAlt>+<Tab> bring up the window list
confirm this, no?

> The other thing to do is to use xmodmap to reflect the same behaviour as

Don't have xkeycaps.  Can I use xev to examine each's behavior?

This is normal for most of keyboards, it is because Meta_L is configured
to be the default key to activate items when released, but Meta_R is not.

Reconfigure your Alt-Tab binding like this:

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease %

The code you posted was in 2.2.x version, you probably have several
fvwm versions installed.

Make sure "man" command may find your man page, something like:

  export MANPATH=/usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man

Hi all,

I'm running gentoo, fvwm 2.5.7 development version,
DirectFB v0.9.17, and XDirectFB 1.0. It works
gloriously except for a couple of problems, one of
which is fvwm related. 

I run 3x3 desktops, and when I move my cursor to an
edge of a screen, the desktop changes. That is good,
but the problem is, the cursor remains at that edge of
the screen on the new desktop... Par exemple: I am in
the center desktop, move mouse to the left, desktop
shifts, but cursor remains on the far left of the
screen.

I had fvwm 2.4.14, then got 2.5.7, same problem with
both. Is there some way I can work around this within
the fvwm config, or is it something with (X)DirectFB?

Thanks,

Ahmed

Have you tried running without using DirectFB?
This is one of the reported bugs since before.
I cannot reproduce it. Maybe it's related to DirectFB.

Seems that it is a XDirectFB problem (not sure). With 2.5.7 you may
found a workaround by using the EdgeCommand command (man fvwm).

So sorry for not making clearer. Without XDFB, I have
absolutely no problems (sorry if my previous message
made out that it was Fvwm's fault). Both 2.4.14 and
2.5.7 work flawlessly without XDFB, it is only when I
attempt to use it, this problem strikes.

Another related issue (that is also only present with
XDirectFB running) is that my keyboard mappings for
fvwm (for Control, Meta, and Shift) only work for
those buttons on the left side of my keyboard. Their
counterparts on the right side donot function. Again,
this is only present when i use XDFB (I just run
startxdfb instead of startx), which I'd like to know
how to fix.

I will look into the EdgeCommand, thanks. Is there any
other settings or commands that might assist this
issue?

Thanks again,

Ahmed

Is it possible to have transparent menus with fvwm 2.5.7?
If so, how would I go about doing it?

It is possible. You should define a colorset with RootTransparent buffer
("buffer" is optional, read FvwmTheme man page) and set a root image
using either Esetroot or "fvwm-root -r".

  Colorset 5 RootTransparent buffer, Tint rgb:00/30/30
  MenuStyle * Colorset 5

I hope this is fixed now in the current cvs. You may try the next

Attn: Dear Sir 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 

I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it's 

success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard this transaction. 

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am 

seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your 

private/company account. 

The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to

 be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$100,000,000.00 (One hundred Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, 

the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor 

at the cost of US$115,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my

 benefit unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the 

Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval. 

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this 

message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company

 account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US

$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account. 

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below. 

20% for you and 80% for us.

What We request from you.

1,your names, company name if any- otherwise we will use your name to register the company.

2, your address, tel, fax and cell phone numbers.

The name of your bank, address.

Account number and swift code or routing number.

The of account holder/beneficiary.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. 

For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification. Please, call me on receipt of this mail on 

Tel: 0031-63 055 8460 

Thank you while I await your urgent response. 

 

Yours Sincerely, 

DR. ABRAHAM ZULU

Hi all,

I fixed the problem, and FVWM is back to sitting on my
box looking lovely. The problem was solved by
re-making (re-emerging in my case) and updating both
DirectFB and XDirectFB to the latest versions, 0.9.18
and 1.0_rc5 respectively. 

Thanks!

Ahmed

I tried that snapshot but it's still not fixed.  The behavior is somewhat
different, though.

When I log out and log back in with the new fvwm, the menu panel is now
about 100 pixels below the top of the screen --- and it cannot be moved.
My edge panel is obscured beneath the menu panel; I know this because
when I delete the menu panel, the edge panel is right there underneath.

Each time I log out/log in, the two panels are still in that same place.

http://tlau.org/panel.png is a screenshot.  You can see smudges along
the lower edge of the menu panel --- these are the icons of the edge
panel underneath.

Keith Packard used his XRender extension to have translucent menus in
TWM (http://keithp.com/~keithp/render/, bottom of the page). Do you
think it would be feasible to get this implemented in FVWM someday ?

cheers,
Remko

Hello from Poland.

I created my first Fvwm theme and I want you to
take a look at this and express your opinion.

http://student.uci.agh.edu.pl/~artursc/screen.png

I must say it wasn't easy because I was shocked
when I saw the .fvwm2rc for the first time.
For begginers the syntax seems to be very difficult
but after few hours with manuals :) everything
becomes clear. Not till then I realized power of
fvwm :)

Please tak a look and enjoy :)

Greetings
Artur Scianek

What about fvwm version 2.4.6? Is it possible to
have transparent menus or should I upgrade fvwm
version?

Hello there in Poland!

Your theme is impressive!

Would you be willing to share your .fvwmrc and the image files?

Thank you for your all opinions.
For those who wants to take a look at me rc file
please download this

http://student.uci.agh.edu.pl/~artursc/artist-xp-theme.tar.gz

This file contains also graphics for window decorations and
taskbar.
I use Fvwm 2.5.7
I compiled it from sources.
I don't use fvwm-themes because I like everything to be done simply
without superflous programs. Whole my configuration depends
only on .fvwm2rc file and graphic files of course.

This creation was inspired by screenshot of Mikhael Goikhman's desktop.
I used Fvwm four years ago for few days :) but I didn't like it
and removed it. I installed Window Maker. Not long ago I visited
fvwm.org for the first time and I was nicely surprized about Fvwm's
possibilities ... soon I became large Fvwm's fan and here you can take
a look at my first creation.

I think my rc file may have some bugs. I'm not quite sure about
configuration of FvwmButtons, but first of all ... this configuration
seems to work ok ... second, I will tune it soon.

Greetings

Hello, all

One (potentially very silly) question:  is there a command that reads
another text file?  I want to have a different file for the window styles,
and, although I figure I could use PipeRead cat <filename>, I wondered if
there's another method.

Now what *I'd* really like is to be able to make this conditional, or
have it evaluate a path.

Something like, say, 

	Read $HOME/bin/$OS/os-specific-settings

Is this possible?

For conditional configs, PipeRead is usually best, but
"Read" will expand environment variables.

I think the preferred syntax is:

Read $[HOME]/bin/$[OS]/os-specific-settings

Cool.  That'll work beautifully.  Now I can have a single .fvwm2rc that
works on all my $UNIX machines, as well as a single .bash_profile.

Thanks!  :)

hi.

there seems to be a problem with gdeskcal
(http://www.pycage.de/software_gdeskcal.html) and FVWM. it works well
with the metacity windowmanager. with fvwm you can see flicker something
up, that disappears immediately. the application does not crash, but
there is no visible calendar.

the problem appears with fvwm 2.5, i did not test 2.4.

Hi everyone

I'm running fvwm 2.5.7. How do I get fvwm to position my mouse pointer
on the title of a menu, rather than on the line under the title, when I
pop up the menu from a short-cut key?

I have ctrl-escape bound to popup my root menu like so :

Key Escape A C Popup Debian

This successfully pops up the menu 'Debian', but my mouse pointer gets
positioned on the line under my menu title, not on the title itself.
I have tried replacing the 'Popup' command with the 'Menu' command
(above) but that hasn't helped.

My menu begins like this :

DestroyMenu Debian
AddToMenu Debian

+  "Root Menu"                         Title
+  "OK"%kdeprint_computer.png%         Popup OK
+  "IAD"%ktalkd.png%                   Popup IAD
+  "terms"%konsole.png%                Popup Terminals

Any ideas?

I cannot reproduce all these problems. May be you should:

- Use the "next" snapshot (optional but there is more session fixes).
- Double check that you do not have one of the following style:
       NoPPosition, NoUSPosition, FixedPPosition, FixedUSPosition,
       FixedPosition
  which can match your panels in your fvwm config file(s).
- Remove the menu panel via gnome (left mouse button on the menu panel).
- Move your edge panel to the bottom via gnome (preference). 
- Readd the menu panel
- Put back your bottom panel to the edge
- Now the 2 panels should be placed correctly ...
- save your session when you logout

If you have still some problem can you send me the following files:

- ~/.gnome2/session
- the most recent ~/.fs-* file
- xprop > menu_panel (type this command and after you get a cross, click
on the menu panel)
- xprop > edge_panel (idem)

How do you set your root background with fvwm?
What happen if you set your root background with Esetroot
or fvwm-root _with_ the -r option?

i have already tried that, it does not help. i also tried to prevent
gdeskcal from doing transparency with the --opaque option. but it
results in the same: gdeskcal keeps running, but its window is lost.
but using --screenshot with gdeskcal actually works, why don't the other
options work, as they do with other windowmanagers i have tested?
i will not switch my windowmanagers just for one single application,
since i have been using fvwm for several years ;)

I need a simple way to have fvwm tell a csh shell the name of the
FvwmPager Desk or FvwmName.

Any suggestions?  -- Everything I tired didn't seem to work.. And I
tried all but the right way ;)

Here are some ideas, if you don't understand them, reask again, but use
more detailed explanation of what exactly you want to achieve.

One solution is to use FvwmCommandS and FvwmCommand (see the man pages).

Another solution is to write something to a file using:

   Exec echo something >$[HOME]/fvwm-info.txt

You may use expending variable, like $[desk.n], $[w.name] and so on.
In 2.5.x there is $[desk.name] that you should set using DesktopName.

You may also use FvwmEvent (see the man page or FAQ):

  *FvwmEvent: new_desk `Exec echo $$[desk.n] >$[FVWM_USERDIR]/current-desk`

Mikhael.

Hi,

I'd be very happy if someone could help me make ./configure (from
fvwm-2.5.7) find my xft. xft is definitly installed (via the gentoo
linux portage mechanism).

After I type ./configure I receive a table with the things that are
going to be supported, however not xft.

Any idea?
Thanks
 Felix

Thank You,

but even with the latest snapshot I get the following (see below). As
other apps like OpenOffice seem to use xft (or does it have its own font
mechanism?) I still don't know what I could do next...
Thanks again,
 Felix

Dear Sir

How can I activate session support in my FVWM2. I could find nothing about
that in the man page.

I tried it out and it works "okay" for me ... I installed from rpm.

The window is very much visible... but it screws up on transparency.. it
seems to be taking a screenshot and using that as a background and if there
are any windows in the position gdeskcal appears.. you can see those windows
too in the background... moving the gdeskcal fixes the problem.

I put it Layer 0 and yet it shows an xterm that was in the default layer in
it's background!

Using fvwm 2.5.7

The session management support is activated automatically once a
session manager is detected.

If you have any problem, please provide full details about your version,
session manager, steps, configuration and anything related.

Mikhael.

I couldn't remember what the deal was this morning, but I just
did now.  Somebody had a problem wherein FVWM wasn't finding 
xft during configuration.  One thing to check is to see whether
there's an "xft.pc" in /usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig, and then make
sure that PKG_CONFIG_PATH includes that directory when you 
run FVWM's configure script. In other words,

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
./configure --whatever

If there's no xft.pc, it should look something like this:

prefix=/usr/X11R6
exec_prefix=/usr/X11R6/bin
libdir=/usr/X11R6/lib
includedir=/usr/X11R6/include
freetypelibs=-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lfreetype
freetypecflags=-I/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2
xrenderlibs=-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXrender
xrendercflags=-I/usr/X11R6/include

Name: Xft
Description: X FreeType library
Version: 2.1.0
Requires: fontconfig
Libs: -L${libdir} -lXft ${freetypelibs} ${xrenderlibs}
Cflags: -I${includedir} ${freetypecflags} ${xrendercflags}



That may or may not work; it was necessary when I was getting Mozilla
to build.

Hello everyone,

I just did an upgrade from 2.4 to 2.5.7 and now I have some strange 
window resize behaviour. When I place the mousecursor on the border of 
any window and drag, nothing happens. When i release the button, I can 
resize until I click again. The same happens with a single click o a 
border, I can resize until I click again.

My rc's haven't changed when I did the upgrade, is this normal 2.5 
behaviour? How can I get back to a "normal" window resizing? Thanks!

It's a side effect of a bugfix we are still discussing.  We have
not yet decided whether we leave it this way in 2.6 or switch back
to the old (wrong) behaviour.  To be safe, you should replace

  mouse 1 sf n resize

(or similar) with

  AddToFunc my_resize
  + I resize
  mouse 1 sf n my_resize

This works as you would expect.

What you're probably seeing is the result of a bugfix (i.e. the old way
isn't supposed to have worked, but it did, and it seems that it's been
widely used.)

So basically, the fix is to put your move command into a function, and
then call the function.  For the chronically lazy or those who aren't
terribly familiar with their fvwm configuration, I made a script a while
back to do the conversion; it's available at
http://themuffin.net/fvwm-mousecmd-convert.awk  It should, at least,
make the required changes obvious so that you can do it yourself if you
prefer.

And it does, thanks! Another question (also new behaviour since the 
upgrade). When I try to move gkrellm (2.1.12) it stays where it is 
until I release the mousebutton, then it pops at the position of the 
mousecursor. Any ideas? Thanks!

Do you mean by clicking on the internal title of the gkrellm
window?  I don't know, it works for me.  It's probably a bug in
gkrellm.

Actually it's the hostname of my box inside gkrellm, and gkrellm is 
"NoTitle'd".

It does something else that's weird. If I click hostname and keep mouse 
button 1 pressed, after about 1.5 seconds the PC speaker beeps and I 
can move gkrellm normally. If I click hostname and move the 
mousepointer (still keeping mouse button one pressed), after the same 
time, gkrellm pops to the new cursorposition.

Other apps don't do this (not even xmms).

Could be, but before I upgraded fvwm it worked as expected and I didn't 
change anything gkrellmish.

I tried changing some of gkrellm internal properties (sticky state 
etc.) but that doesn't change anything. Strange...

Gkrellm is probably trying to grap control of the mouse pointer
but some other application has already grabbed it - most likely
fvwm itself.  Do you have any mouse bindings on the 'W' indow
context?  A la

  mouse 1 w n ...

If fvwm has grabbed the pointer, that is because you somehow told
it to do so.

Since I could reproduce this, I decided to track it down...

fvwm is indeed trying to grab the pointer and failing [XBell() at
functions.c:992 in execute_complex_function], however, it's not because
of anything Jules has done...

In ConfigFvwmDefaults, an EWMHActivateWindowFunc function is
defined--whenever gkrellm is clicked on to be moved (I think GTK2 is=20
what's actually causing this to happen), EWMHActivateWindowFunc is
called, causing this problem.

Which gkrellm version?  It doesn't happen with 1.2.10.  Anyway,
this is a gkrellm bug:

An application can not expect that the window manager processes
any requests (_NEW_WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message in this case)
while the server/pointer/keyboard is grabbed.  This should be
fixed in gkrellm.  Could someone report this to the developers?

Apr 27 (as well as today.)

Beautiful! I'm also relatively new to fvwm and in the process of
evolving my own theme. I hope it ends up looking as nice and
well-finished as yours.

The 7/23 snapshot is somewhat better but still not fixed.  The menu
panel is now correctly placed at the top of the screen.  However, the
edge panel also starts out underneath the menu panel at the top of the
screen, with a few rows of pixels barely visible underneath the meun
panel.  I am able to click on those few pixels and move it down to the
bottom of the screen where it belongs.

However, when I log out and log back in, the edge panel is back up at
the top of the screen.  I repeated this several times, and each time the
edge panel starts at the top of the screen.

I got the 7/23 snapshot.

I commented out everything referencing "Position" in
/etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc and ~/.fvwm/*, before logging in with the
newly installed fvwm snapshot.

Did this, see above.

I'll attach these files to this email.  Thanks for looking into this.
If there's anything else I can do to debug, I'm happy to help.

It was me, thanks.

Unfortunatelly, I don't even have pkconfig installed. Someone from the
gentoo distro forum told me that xft is included in the last xfree86
package so I should evoid having xft installed additionally. But even
without it ./configure (the snapshot from 2003-07-23) doesn't find xft.
I'll try to reinstall the latest xfree86.

btw: Someone else told me that it should work with the latest cvs
version. As I am not familliar with cvs: Is there a significant
difference between "the latest snapshots" and "cvs"?

'Bye

Hi,
now I've tried to activate xft with fvwm (snapshot from 2003-07-23) via
uninstalling xft and installing a brand new version from xfree86
(4.3.99) as someone told me that xft is integrated in xfree86. But still
fvwm's ./configure doesn't find xft on my system. Here is an extract
from ./configure's output.
Someone else mentioned that all this is due to missing
fontconfig-config?

Depends when a bug is fixed in cvs. When you see "try one of the latest
snapshots" this means that a problem was attended at least several days
ago. If it is attempted to be fixed about the time the message is sent,
you may see "try the next snapshot".

Regarding your problem, you need either xft-config or pkg-config
reporting about xft (try "pkg-config --modversion xft"), and either
fontconfig-config or pkg-config reporting about fontconfig.

There was a bug in cvs regarding the pkg-config method that is just
fixed, so try either the latest cvs or the next snapshot.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thank you,
that was the missing hint... :-)
xft-config was present only with the user, not with root. So I executed
./configure as user and now I have beautiful xft fonts in my fvwm! Thank
You!

Last question about xft: The clock in the task bar is not affected by
the font changes. Is that by default?

This is my current font setting in fvwm2rc:

Style * Font "xft:Luxi
Sans:Medium:Bold:size=10;-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

MenuStyle * font "xft:Luxi
Sans:Medium:Bold:size=10;-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

MenuStyle winops font "xft:Luxi
Sans:Medium:Bold:size=10;-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

*FvwmTaskBar: Font "xft:Luxi
Sans:Medium:Bold:size=10;-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

*FvwmTaskBar: SelFont "xft:Luxi
Sans:Medium:Bold:size=10;-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

Hej list!

Wouldn't it be great if fvwm has its own wiki? Fvwm is customizable and
there are so a lot of usefull code snippets, that i would lek the idea
of a playce where we can collect such things. In the FAQ are already
some great pieces, but there are doubtless a lot more...

What do you think of that?

Mario

Hi all,

Version 2.0 of FvwmTabs is available:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

This version implements a balloon popup over the tab buttons with
balloonBG, balloonWait & balloonFont options.

Useful for when the tab button size truncates the button name, or
you want to find a window based on its title.

SCoTT. :)

Hi,
I recognized that under special circumstances the menu items are not
highlighted:

To produce this case:
- click on default button / "start" button (in TaskBar)
- select a menu item in the menu via one click...
- ... to open a submenu (must be present)
- then move the mouse within the sub menu items (highlighting is ok)
- then move the mouse to a sub sub menu (must have one): here
highlighting is not done.

I just wanted to report that.
I am using the snapshot from 2003-07-23.

Felix

That's a feature called "posting" menus.  By clicking on a submenu
item, fvwm is instructed to ignore mouse motion outside this sub
menu.

Thought I'd send this one in, I've been using fvwm for about
8 years and I've refined my config down to this.

F1-F12 bring desktops 1->12, Shift-F1 -> Shift F12 bring desktops 13
-> 24.

Pause/Break brings up the menu (as does lmse in root).

It's very simple, one window per desktop, but browsers always open in
desk/page 4, xemacs/gnuclient in page 1, I open all audio apps on desk
11 and mail apps on desk 12.

What makes this really nice is that I have menu's to ssh remote xterms
and depending where I'm working I'll make a particular machine appear
on a particular desktop.

This is why I have 24 pages/desks, as at some recent clients site I
had far too many machines to connect to and just wanted to bung all the
crud on desks 13+.

Icons are turned off. The menu's are simple.

If you want to send Fkeys to apps you just need numlock on.

Anyway, thought I'd send this in because I've not seen any other
really clean setups on the screenshot list.

Ok, if I well understand when you use gnome to "move" your edge
panel it is not placed correctly.

What I do: I right click on a panel and create an edge panel.  Then I
right click on this edge panel and open the properties (gnome)
dialog. With this dialog I can place my edge panel at 12 different
positions on the screen (top-left, middle-left, bottom-left,
left-bottom, middle-bottom, ...etc.). When I try all these positions
the edge panel does not interfere with the menu panel (and my bottom
panel). I use gnome-2.0.
 
If I well understand, when you do the same operation your edge
panel interfere with your menu panel when you place at the different
"top" positions (5 possibilities). Can you confirm this? What
version of gnome do you use?

If this is the case this is a gnome-panel bug. fvwm respects the
position the gnome-panel ask for.

However, what may happen is that your version of GNOME use a new
method to move resize a window (via _NET hints) which is not yet
implemented in fvwm and that the replacement method used by the
gnome panel when a window manager does not support this method
is broken.

We will implement this method soon and I will ask you to test
it when a snapshot will contain the "fix".

Thanks, Olivier

No.  The panel is not placed correctly at login.  Let me describe the
problem in more detail.

I usually use a single edge panel at the top of the screen (since I
have all these problems with the menu panel, I don't use it).  Starting
from that configuration, I can create a menu panel:

-- right-click on the edge panel and select properties
(the "top" position is depressed)
-- I select the "bottom" position
(the edge panel is now at the bottom of my screen)
-- I right click on the edge panel, select New Panel -> Menu Panel
(a menu panel appears at the top of my screen)
(I now have a menu panel at the top, and an edge panel at the bottom)
-- From the menu panel, select Actions -> Log out
(I have a GNOME preference set to always save my session on logout)
-- Log in

When I log in again, the menu panel is at the top of the screen, and the
edge panel is underneath it, with only a few pixels visible.

-- I right click on the edge panel (hard because it's mostly obscured by
the menu panel)
(when I do that, the edge panel comes to the front, obscuring the menu
panel)
-- Select "Properties"

In the "Panel Properties" dialog that comes up, the "bottom" position is
depressed, as in this screenshot:  http://tlau.org/panel2.png
Yet the panel is clearly not at the bottom, it's near the top.

If I log out and log in again, the same thing happens; the two panels are
placed on top of each other at the top of the screen.

I have only one possibility for the "top" position, as you can see in
the panel2.png screenshot.

I have GNOME panel version 2.2.2 (right click on the panel, select
"About panels").

I can move the edge panel to any of four positions: top, left, right,
and bottom.  If I use the properties dialog to move the panel around,
the panel never overlaps with the menu panel.  It's only on login that
the two panels are placed incorrectly.

Hope that helps.  Let me know if you want me to describe anything else
in more detail.

Exuse me if I'm posting questions that have been asked before, but I'm
running 2.5.7 FVWM with the themes, and I'd really like to get transparent
Xterms and menus (that is, I'd like the text to appear as if it were on
the root window where my background picture is displayed).

I understand the layout for Themes, as I've begun to piece together my own
from the ones available.  I tracked down an asortment of info regarding
Colorsets, ParentalRelativity, fvwm-root -d, and so on, but I just can't
put the pieces together.

Thanks for any help,

Chris.

1) Run "aterm -tr" or other terminals like gnome-terminal and Eterm that
support transparency (see their man pages), and set the root using
fvwm-root -r (or fvwm-themes-root in pre-0.7.0).

The Themes FAQ may help to make such transparent terminal to be your
default terminal.

2) Several days ago I answered how to make transparent menus in 2.5.x.
Here are the lines again (try in FvwmConsole first):

  Colorset 5 RootTransparent buffer, Tint rgb:00/30/30 20, bg average, bgTint rgb:00/30/30 20
  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5  # this line is redundand for fvwm-themes

If you have problems with creating your own theme, ask on the fvwm-themes
lists.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

I use the tool "checkinstall" to install fvwm (the current CVS version) 
on my debian/testing Linux. checkinstall warns me that some of the files 
created by the installation are inside the build directory. Here is the 
list of the files:

/usr/local/src/fvwm_cvs/fvwm/bin/fvwm-root
/usr/local/src/fvwm_cvs/fvwm/bin/fvwm-root.1
/usr/local/src/fvwm_cvs/fvwm/fvwm/fvwm
/usr/local/src/fvwm_cvs/fvwm/fvwm/fvwm.1
/usr/local/src/fvwm_cvs/fvwm/modules/FvwmEvent/FvwmEvent

Is this a bug in checkinstall or is there something in the "make 
install" mechanism of fvwm that is not correct?

(I just want to report this)

Gert

Hello,

when I start fvwm (the current CVS version) and open FvwmTaskbar, 3 
rxvts  and mozilla with 1 browser and 1 mail window the order of the 
windows in the FvwmTaskbar is:

  rxvt, rxvt, rxvt, mozbrowser, mozmailer

when I leave this desktoppage and return back (by EdgeSwitching by 
mouse) the order of the windows changes to

  mozmailer, mozbrowser, rxvt, rxvt, rxvt

When I repeat the page change the order keeps the same in most cases, 
but not always. It seems to be a little random like? Maybe it has to do 
with the order of the last focused windows?

Is this ok, or is it a bug?

Oh, btw: In the current version of fvwm FvwmTaskbar is very very slow. 
When switching to another (empty) page it takes about 2 seconds until 
all listed windows are hidden in the FvwmTaskbar. When I return to the 
page with some windows on, I can watch each single window 
(represantation) pop up in the Fvwm. I think, this is not normal.

Thanks,

Gert

It points to symlinked files, hovewer they are not created in the build
directory. Most probably a bug in checkinstall.

Is the short titlebar form being considered for an FVWM enhancement?  
I'm not familiar with VTWM's implementation, but KDE's implementation 
causes the short titlebars to automatically move across the top of 
the window as necessary, to remain visible, if another window 
overlays it.

Hello Bill,

Last week I seem to have found a bug in gkrellm. I found your email 
address at the gkrellm site and took the liberty of mailing you this 
snip of a thread on the fvwm mailing list.

I also post this to the mailing list, because if you have technical 
questions, I probably won't be able to answer :-)

Regards,

Since I could reproduce this, I decided to track it down...

fvwm is indeed trying to grab the pointer and failing [XBell() at
functions.c:992 in execute_complex_function], however, it's not because
of anything Jules has done...

In ConfigFvwmDefaults, an EWMHActivateWindowFunc function is
defined--whenever gkrellm is clicked on to be moved (I think GTK2 is 
what's actually causing this to happen), EWMHActivateWindowFunc is
called, causing this problem.

Maybe. But it is not always needed to grab the pointer when we execute
a complex function. So, I suggest that when fvwm fail to grab the
pointer for executing a complex function we do not abort the function
execution.  This fix Jules problem (that I can reproduce, and it
happens the same thing with the Mozilla resize grip).  What do you
think?

Note that the "problem" does not arise to me with 2.5.7 and I think
that it appears _for me_ during your recent work on ConfigureRequest
Event. However, it seems that Jules use 2.5.7.

Regards, Olivier

I think it's a bad idea.  It is practically impossble to guess
whether a function needs to grab the pointer before executing or
not, and it depends on what other application do too.  For
example, if an application warps the pointer while a function is
executed, all sorts of strange things can happen.

I don't think so.  That has nothing to do with the problem.

I agree. I have the problem now with 2.5.7, before the upgrade I 
didn't.

In fact I can reproduce the gkrellm problem only on certain condition:
I've a FvwmEvent running which executes a complex function on each
module events. fvwm bell and abort a complex function which is run
with a raise_window (gkrellm) or a configure_window (Mozilla resizing
with grip). Also I've an FvwmEvent which auto shade a FvwmButtons with
a delay via leave_window (with the schedule command and a "shade"
complex function). When, I leave the FvwmButtons and popup a menu of
an application before auto shade the "auto shade" complex function
xbell and abort.

So I really think that by default we should not abort complex
functions when we cannot grab the cursor. Maybe a Grab prefix or a
Grab function (with automatic ungrab) should be introduced, but I
_think_ that the case where we need to grab is exceptional. Do you
have a real life example (say in your fvwm config)?

Yes, Sorry, no FvwmEvent running when I do the test with 2.5.7.

I proposed that a couple of month ago as well. Surely it would would be nice 
to have such a thing but noone seems to have tackled it and I just don't 
have the time. Maybe you could do it? I'm sure the FVWM web site 
maintainers will provide you with the neccessary web space.

I am not that sure if it is that appropriate. 
(see http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki) Allowing everyone
to edit site contents requires the pages to be maintained,
so that advertising and other unwanted, probably illegal
stuff is removed. On the wiki pages at
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiSandbox one can even place
pictures which is quite precarios since someone could place
illegal ones. Sure, the changer's IP address is stored
but it seems a lot of work to trace somebody which can be
identified by it's IP address only.

Further I don't think that it is that good for storing
config parts for fvwm because users will hardly find
something, since it will be just to much.

I'd rather if we collect config parts, like button setups,
titlebar decorations, menu definitions and fvwm scripts, and
place them together with a screenshot and description on the
web site.
Having them fully maintained ensures higher quality and
saves the user time (and nerves :-)

Regards, Uwe

The pointer *must* be grabbed during function execution.  We have
made various attempts to ignore this in the past, and they all
ended in disaster.  For example, if the user can click in windows
(or release a button - quite likely during function execution) she
can cause EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events, screwing up scripts
that make tricky use of Raise/Lower/Focus.

I agree with Uwe. The current approach is a lot easier, much more
maintainable, and gives a good overview. The threshold is a little bit
higher, because you have to actually send a mail to someone, but maybe
that isn't really such a bad thing after all ;-)

IMHO, wiki is only suitable for early stages of a work in progress, when
things are in a state of flux, and having centralized documents is a lot
of overhead on synchronization. But once things stopped moving, the
whole wiki hierarchy (which is usually a huge mess by then in which you
get lost very quick) should be organized into centrally administered
documents.

Just my 2 cents.

cheers,
Remko

I want to have a transparent menu with the root image given by xsetroot:
xsetroot -mod 4 4 -bg rgb:10/18/20 -fg rgb:30/38/40

I do this by using gimp to grab "xsetroot -mod 4 4 -bg rgb:10/18/20 -fg
rgb:30/ 38/40" to a image file.
Is there a simple way ?

If the maintainer of the homepage agree with that, i will be happy ... :)

It could be very hard to get a centralized document of configuration
scripts. But there will be a dozen differant ways to make a panel with
FVWMButtons for example. How do you want to deal with that in a
centralized document? I think you talk about a manual but i want seomthing for
configuration. In the moment all of these things are put in the
faq. Okay for the moment ... but a faq could become very unreadable if
add a dozen alternatives for every problem on it ...

If there is webspace and a rough consens that we want something like
that, i would do that although i never have started a public wiki ....
But couldn't be that hard and maybe someone could help me... :)

I got the idea of wiki, but I see not that big difference to
the current mailing list procedure. Everyone is free to post
ideas, scripts, shots... to the fvwm-mailing list. If the
posted is good we will put it on the web site.

At the moment mainly I keep the web site up to date. I just
commit my changes via cvs.

A couple of months ago I remade the fvwm web site using php.
At the moment I am working on a concept making the
screenshot and maybe download pages generic, so that it will
be easier to add new shots, scripts, pics and information.
Users won't be allowed to do changes but it will be much
easier for the maintainer to add resources to the web
site. Since my time is quite limited (full-time work and
one-year old son :-) progress is quite poor.

If you would like to do some work on the web site you might
get cvs access, but I am not the one to be asked for that.

If it is small you could send it to the fvwm-mailing list,
if it is bigger please provide a link were we can
download it.

Mailing-lists,irc and wiki have many things in common. I prefer wikis
before lists because the information is sorted and easier to find than
searching for subjects in a archive of a list. I had always the feeling
that here are a lot of god hints that are never getting on the
site... Transparent menus are one thing for example (a bad one, okay,
as this should be really easy to find searching the archive but
neverless), the question hit the mailing list every month or so, but it
is not in the faq ... i'm sure could find some other examples....

I never really got used to things like xml,html or php ... Me would be a
very bad choice to help maintaining a homepage... :)

When for example a configuration of a panel is suitable for the
homepage i will.... :)

You are right, currently the web page does not provide good
configs and setups. As I said I am going to change that. But
it may take some time.

Certainly, I think we should provide all kinds of configs like for
FvwmButtons, FvwmWindowList, Pager, Menus and so on. It may
just take some time until this this kind of resource pool has
been set up.

If your are going to provide a FvwmButton-setup, please
ensure that it runs as you expect by Reading this config
file using 

Read FvwmButtonrc

So it is easier for other users to use your config. Please
provide pixmaps for the buttons, links to the programs to be
swallowed, a screenshot of the button bar and a short
description.  

Regards, Uwe

Hm, other Wikis that I've used word fine (e.g. WikiPedia or the EMACS Wiki). 
But maybe that really involves some good administration. So, why not try it 
out? Maybe it works, maybe not.

I see the advantages of a Wiki in it being an intermediate thing between the 
FAQ (which is very slow to update and possibly can't cover as much content) 
and the mailing lists (which are there for discussion and not to find ready 
made solutions).

Hm, then I would have a couple of things to contribute. Among other things
1. a setup of a simple clock running in an rxvt that can be swallowed in the
   panel,
2. a setup of a simple tool to watch log files (again running in an rxvt)
   including the neccessary FVWM menu setup,
3. a setup for geometric arrangement and management of desktops (i.e. they
   are navigatable by keyboard shortcuts, and are not arranged in a linear
   fashion),
4. a method to include menus for CodeWeavers CXOffice and CXPlugin.

All these things took me quite some time to set up and are of general 
interest. In addition I would for example like to see other people's small 
one-liners for clocks, dial up utilities, etc..

Would you really add this to the FAQ?

Would I post it to the mailing list? No, because I don't want to waste my 
time to dig it out, add some explanatory text and just see it vanishing in 
the archives.


> Having them fully maintained ensures higher quality and
> saves the user time (and nerves :-)

Higher quality? - maybe. Users time and nerves? - probably not. Let's not 
forget what costs really time and nerves: browsing the mailing list 
archives and trying to forge things by oneself.

someone from contributing something that might come in handy)

well. actually everybody who puts up example configuration and other
information on the wiki is also able to remove illegal and unwanted
stuff. so the wiki is maintained by the wiki users itself. the work
needed to maintain the wiki is divided up between its users and saves a
lot of time to everybody. maintaining such a huge information pool would
be a fulltime job for a single person.

at least a wiki would be more organized than mailinglist archives ;) ...
you can have many categories instead of sorting by thread or date. and
then, there is a search function for most wikis.

> Having them fully maintained ensures higher quality and
> saves the user time (and nerves :-)

this would mean, as i said, a lot of effort and time for a maintainer,
while the wiki is maintained by its users itself.

We talked about that all today on the channel on freenode and decided
to just start away and see how it works. Maybe discussion on
the channel is more straight forwarded, so we would be happy if you
join us there, but naturally that should be also discussed on the list! 

We made  quick and dirty list of thinks we want to see on the wiki:

we need:
  - easy, pastable <pre> for code snippets and config stuff
  - anchors
  - css
  - search function with regexp (hopefully Perl-like)
  - subpages
  - file uploading
  - possibly images
  - diffs
  - diff changes, comment changes, show which "user" made changes 
  
don't need:
  - colors

Webspace can be provided by Rene van Bevern (RvB) ...

Hope some people here like our idea and are willing to make the wiki a
important part of the fvwm-family!

Greetings!
   Mario

so i did. i put up a configured MoinMoin Wiki on
http://rvb.dyndns.org/FvwmWiki with an fvwm css style and a basic front
page. the next task is finding a suitable structure to sort the data.
don't forget: wiki is teamwork. you are all invited giving ideas on that
topic. for now i will base a template table of contents from the
category of the FAQ.

Maintaining is done by some people from the fvwm freenode channel,
because discussion there is faster than on mailinglists. Namely these
are:
	Rene van Bevern (RvB)
	Stephan Beyer (sbeyer, who is not even on this list)
	Mario Domg=F6rgen (Kanaldrache)
of course others are invited to help us.

you could put a link on the fvwm page where it is well visible.

Looks nice, lets see how it goes. 

Just one thing to mention: Currently the logo competition is
in progress. Putting a logo which takes part on the
competition on the wiki page seems preselecting this one,
which is not that fair. 

So until one logo has been chosen as official the official
one I think it is better to remove the logo from the wiki
page.

After this is done I will link the wiki page from the fvwm
homepage. 

Another thing are copyright issues. Is it allowed to take
contents from the wiki pages and place them on the fvwm web
site without asking the author? Does the author give a
permission automatically to distibute his contents?

Regards, Uwe

But it seems to me that we need grabing only if the function has
a non immediate context? It is simple to detect this situation and
to non grab (or grab fast, i.e., try to grab only once and do
not abort if grabbing fail) for "immediate only" function. I've
writting such a patch and cannot reproduce problem.

What do you think?

Unfortunately I currently don't have much time for discussion and 
maintenance. However, I'm willing to contribute some content (need to read 
the documentation first, though). Due to Paul Smith's request the first 
thing would be instructions on how to include the menus from CodeWeavers 
CXOffice and CXPlugin into FVWM. Any ideas where to put it? What about an 
additional "Menus" section in the configuration section?

I second that. A Wiki needs many active users to be usable. There should at 
least be a link to the WIKI on the FVWM documentation page.

thing would be instructions on how to include the menus from CodeWeavers 
CXOffice and CXPlugin into FVWM. Any ideas where to put it? What about an 
additional "Menus" section in the configuration section?

I second that. A Wiki needs many active users to be usable. There should at 
least be a link to the WIKI on the FVWM documentation page.

okay, agree with that. i will change the logo.

we could put a kind of disclaimer document on the wiki pages, which sais
that all information provided through the wiki may be used on the
fvwm.org homepage also. maybe with a link to the originating wiki.

No, that is wrong.

  AddToFunc foo
  + I do this
  + I do that
  Mouse 1 t n foo

is no better than

  AddToFunc bar
  + C do this
  + C do that
  Mouse 1 t n bar

For example, look at this:

  Style * SLoppyFocus
  AddToFunc next_focus
  + I next focus
  + I next warptowindow 0 0
  mouse 1 t n next_focus

If the pointer is not grabbed, the following may happen:

 1)  User presses mouse button on window title (triggering
     EnterNotify/LeaveNotify events).
 2a) Some application grabs the pointer.  This may cause
     EnterNotify/LeaveNotify events.
 2b) Fvwm focuses next xterm and warps the pointer into the
     window, generating more EnterNotify/LeaveNotify events.
 2c) User releases button (more EN/LN events).

Which window ends up with the focus is more or less random.  It
depends on the order of 2a, 2b and 2c and possibly the windows
involved.

This is not theory - the grabs are there for exactly this reason.
There is no reliable way of filtering out the random events caused
by applications.

I think it will replace one kind of problems with another one.

(and we have the same problem if function execution is triggered
by a client message or schedule or a module or ...).

Hello world,

I recently upgraded to Gnome 2.x (Debian's unstable distribution). Suddenly
my FvwmPager never appears. The logs show only:

[FVWM][FlushMessageQueue]: <<ERROR>> Failed to write descriptor to 'FvwmPager':
- - select rc=0
- - terminate signal=N

I've rebuilt fvwm (thinking that maybe the gnome 1.4 era compile was
the problem) but nothing changed.

Hints?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm

The situation is differrent. With the "I" function "do this" and "do
that" are a priorie executed immediatly (but see below).  With the "C"
function "do this" and "do that" are executed after button release
only.

Unable to reproduce this, but this is not the point (do not found a
method to get 2a). At first I thought that 2a) cannot cause problem as
2b should be executed "immediately". At least I thought fvwm does not
process events between 1 and 2b (and I think that fvwm should
not). But I've noted that the trigger_evtype of
execute_complex_function is lost sometime (using Next is an example)
so DeferExecution forces focus to be executed only when the button is
released. It seems to me that this is a bug.
 
In fact it seems that your example can happen on exceptional situation
because DeferExecution run over focus will try to grab and if it
fails will abort focus. Of course I think that it is a bug that we
DeferExec at this point (but it is one reason for precessing event).
I may miss something (function code is complex), but this is not my
point too.

Yes maybe, but I really would like to found a solution (Note the
examples with FvwmEvent).

I recall the current way of executing complex function regarding these
problems: Grab and really try to grab (this may take a few seconds)
and if the grab fail abort the func (and essentially this is in this
case that the grab procedure take a _few seconds_).  fvwm grabbing is
slow because basically fvwm wait for success.

An alternative interesting method: Try to grab fast (just try to grab
once or twice) and _if the grab fail_ execute the func anyway.
(an obvious alternative is to try to grab fast and if the grab fail
abort the function, but see below). 

The first remark is that in most cases the grab will not
fail. Moreover, I think that this method should be applied only for
totally immediate func (we should really grab for H,M and D). Maybe
others conditions can be added.  I think it will be difficult to
reproduce a problem with this method.  Note that we try to grab here.

Here a "problem" which can happen with this method (but which has more
or less nothing to do with complex function). Type in an FvwmConsole

AddToFunc WS
+ I  WindowShade

Schedule 5000 All (FvwmConsole) WS

then use an app for grabbing the cursor before the scheduled cmd is
executed (e.g., by opening a menu of this app and do not close it).
When WS is executed, with the current method WS is aborted (after a
few seconds of fvwm freeze). With the fast grab and exec method when
WS is executed X and fvwm take a lot of CPU (fortunately, at low
price) until the app ungrab the pointer (e.g., by poping down the menu)
and then the FvwmConsole is shaded (ok).

This has nothing to do with complex function as this can be reproduced
with the current code with:

Schedule 5000 All (FvwmConsole) WindowShade

I do not know if this is a real issue but I am just afraid that we
should add new prefix commands as ForceGrab (try to grab and do not
execute if grabbing fail) and ForceFastGrab (try to grab fast and do
not execute if grabbing fail).

What do you think of all that? I am ready to work/think on any others
proposal suggestion ...

Welcome to maintenance hell:

 - apparingly random results in funtion execution
 - random fvwm freezes if XQueryPointer or similar funcitons are
   called while an application holds a grab

I'm 100% against it.  Not that my opinion counts for much in this

Hi together,

I am using 3 desktops each of them runs certain
applications. Some of them create little message windows
like "Connection timeout", "Find in progress" and so on. If
I am on say desktop 2 and a application on desktop 1 creates
such a window, fvwm changes to desktop 1 so that I can see
this little window. 

Is there a way to avoid this automatic desktop changing?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers, Uwe

I think that you do not understand me. I see bugs that I can reproduce
easily and I want to found a solution. I really care that fvwm can
work well with certain applications (e.g., Mozilla and gkrellm). And
what about all your work on autohide with the Schedule command and
FvwmEvent (via WindowShade)?

You give an example and I study it carefully and found some strange
behavior in the current code.

You claim that my ideas can give raise to some bug. I cannot reproduce
any one but I trust you.

I say that I am ready to work on any other idea.

Now you say that I am a wall! This is funny. Maybe you should read my
mail (this discussion has nothing todo with the WindowStyle discussion).

I'm talking only about not grabbing the pointer in complex
functions.  Argue as much as you want, it does not work because it
can not work reliably under X, for example because of the way
EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events work.  If you don't like it,
all you can do is to delay function execution until the pointer
can be grabbed (i.e. loop forever in certain places).  But - this
may generate a deadlock with applications that grab the pointer
and then expect that the window manager processes requests.

I spend much more time reading list mail carefully than you think
(and than I should spend, for that matter).

Please don't take this the wrong way.
Not all of us have your deep understanding of fvwm.

If the goal is to run some functions without grabbing,
why not make it an option?

Like:

FunctionNoGrab FUNCNAME

or Grab and UnGrab comands:

DestroyFunc ScreenDump
AddToFunc ScreenDump
+ I UnGrab
+ I Exec xwd
+ ...

Hi everyone

I'm using fvwm 2.5.7. When I popup a menu using my mouse eg

Mouse 3   R  A  Menu Debian

the mouse pointer is positioned on the title of the menu.
However, when I popup a menu using a shortcut key eg

Key   Escape    A     C     Menu Debian

the mouse pointer is positioned on the first item *under* the menu
title. When I use the 'Popup' command the result is the same. If I use a
different shortcut key the result is the same.

Does anyone know if this is normal for fvwm, and if so, how I might
achieve having my mouse pointer positioned on the menu title, rather
than on the first item under the title, when I pop the menu up from a
shortcut key? 

I have tried creating a function that moves my mouse pointer after the
menu has been popped up :

AddToFunc PopupRootMenu         I Menu Debian
+                               I CursorMove 0p -10p

but this only moves my mouse pointer after the menu has terminated.

Yours stuck

Please give an example I can reproduce. I think there is some but I would
like to see one which is reproducible. The example you give cannot
happen I think (and there are problems in the code with this example).
Note, again, that aborting complex function can _also_ break things! 

It is clear that you can do too much things with complex function to
have a default regarding grabbing. My hope is/was that this can be
detected in the average and add a special stuff for the unlikely
case.

I think that Dan idea is ok (I do not want to fight too much
more). I've suggested the converse: added a ForceGrab and
ForceFastGrab "dummy command" because again I cannot reproduce
(or even get one problem with my logic).

Do not underestimate my understanding of fvwm and X (however, I am not
(yet?) a big specialist of complex functions).

In a certain sense fvwm already "freeze" when grabbing fail: when
grabbing fail when you execute a complex function fvwm freeze for a few
seconds in GrabEm and in fact this cause the problem with gkrellm: If
you try to grab only once when executing complex function and abort if
this fail gkrellm can be moved smoothly.

Yes why not. In fact what is needed if we go this way is a "Grab fast
and abort if fail" and a "Grab fast and continue if fail" pre cmds.

Hi,

I want to remove a superfluous page that I created recently but I'm unable 
to do so because the actions at the bottom of the page don't include the 
delete action. However, in "Recent Changes" I see that other users were 
able to delete pages. So what is the way to go?

Hi,

I also have a critique about the UserPreferences page: When creating my 
account I was confused that I have to enter my email address twice and some 
kind of ID. This was due to the fact that the fields for logging in are not 
visually separated from the fields for registration (putting login and 
registration on the same page is a bad idea anyways):

                   Your email address: ________
                   [Mail me my account data]
missing separator: ----------------------------
                   ID ________
                   [Login]
missing separator: ----------------------------
                   Name ________
                   ...

Maybe someone could fix the UserPreferences macro?

i did not activate the DeletePage action for security reasons. the
"Deleted" pages were deleted on the command line in the wiki file
structure itself ... we should discuss about enabling the DeletePage
feature.

Hm, I don't know how to do that (and I probably don't have the permissions 
to do so). Therefore, could you do it for me? The FEKlee page is obsolete 
and should be deleted. BTW, the reason that it is obsolete now has to do 
with the UserPreferences problem outlined in the thread above (and also 
with the fact that it is late now and I should go to bed). Here's how I got 
confused:
1. When creating a new account I entered "FEKlee" into the ID field and
   "Felix E. Klee" into the Name field because I thought that the data in
   the ID field will become my user name and Name is for, well, my name.
2. Then I created my local user page by the name of FEKlee and wondered why
   it doesn't get linked to from e.g. RecentChanges (the reason was of
   course that my user name was "Felix E. Klee").
3. So I thought that FEKlee is not a proper WikiName (but actually it is)
   and tried to change it into FelixKlee in UserPreferences but I couldn't
   find any way to change my user name (I still thought that Name referred
   to my normal name and not my user name).
4. Failing to do so, I created a new account and a new local user page by
   the name of FelixKlee and I finally found out that Name refers to the
   user name.

So, in a nutshell, the data on UserPreferences page needs to be rearranged, 
at least for people like me. In addition to separators (if the login and 
registration really must be on one page) the registration documentation 
should be move above the registration fields so that one can read it easier 
while filling these in.

Hey all,

We're currently trying to implement a window manager that using the
gecko rendering engine to do window decoration rendering (as well as
control window position, size, etc.). We were considering designing our
own WM, however after a tip-off I discovered that fvwm may have a better
solution.
My real question is, wether it is an easy process to allow our frontend
stuff handle the window decoration and allow communication to fvwm, in
terms of interface anyways.

thanks!

Here are my humble thoughts.

You may write your own module that handles window decorations.

Since the existing decoration code is very hardwired into fvwm and can't
be interfaced within the modules, it is easier not to use it at all.
Instead, your module may swallow (reparent) a window and add any
decoration to it. Think about FvwmButtons, or maybe FvwmTabs.

Here is a possible scenario. You create FvwmGeckoDecors module (I guess
in C, but Perl is possible too). The user may configure it statically
either using your own format in ~/.fvwm/.FvwmGeckoDecors or using the
fvwm module configuration style:

  *FvwmGeckoDecors: WoodTheme TopLeftTitleImage brown-tlt.png

  *FvwmGeckoDecors: Mouse 3 T S RaiseLower    # Shift-Mouse3 on title

He may send dynamical actions to the module too:

  SendToModule FvwmGeckoDecors SwitchTheme metal

This suggests that your module implements the mouse/key bindings similar
to what is used with the native fvwm decorations. And then send the
configured commands back to fvwm for execution (in our case above it is
RaiseLower).

Now, you have several choices of which windows should be redecorated by
your FvwmGeckoDecors. You may make it choosable by a user:

  Mouse 1 W CM FvwmGeckoDecors         # Ctrl-Alt-Mouse1 in window
  Key G A SCM Pick FvwmGeckoDecors     # Shift-Ctrl-Alt-G anywhere

or just listen to add_window packet and swallow any new window.

This is just one possible scenario. To help it work well, you may set all
windows to be without the native decorations.

  Style * !Title, !Borders           # you work with cvs, right?

Or at least make the module window (gecko decors) naked:

  Style FvwmGeckoDecors !Title, !Borders

For the smooth performance you most likely need to modify fvwm, but this
is not needed just to start with the implementation. The best solution is
probably to move the current window decoration code to modules, but this
would be pretty difficult.

Regards,
Mikhael.
