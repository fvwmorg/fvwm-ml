Send your full FvwmButtons configuration if you can't figure it out.
You should use a non-zero Frame value for this feature to be visible.

Any button with (Action `Exec "app_pattern" your_app with arguments`)
or (Swallow "app_pattern" your_app with arguments) stays pressed until
a window matching "app_pattern" appears.

> Do I need to provide a "pressed down" version of those icons?

No. Currently only relief is changed from "raised" to "sunken". It would
be nice to have an option to shift an Action button foreground (icon,
text) in +2+2 pixels when pressed. Something like "PressedOffset 2 2".
Maybe I will add this later when I have a time. Any other volunteer?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does anyone know if pcfileviewer (view pc docs on solaris) runs on fvwm?
Or is it purely a CDE app?

Thanx

Could it be the case,that fvwm>2.2.5 delivers events to "wish" as a different
type. The update command distinguishes between all events (no parameter) and
idle callbacks (parameter idletasks). Using no parameter for the update there
are no problems (if I remember correctly), but that aim't no the way to go.
Seems like good old 2.2.5 delivers events the do get processed as idle
callbacks, whereas all follow versions don't. I have to take a look at the tcl
sources to get an idea, which event's are put into which category.

Ok folks,
got it: I used the suggested syntax for FvwmButtons, dropped the
transparent background and now buttons stay pressed until applications have
started.
...but I'd like to have the best of both worlds (=transparent back +
changing icons) :)))

So, since you're seeking for volunteers Mikhael, I can try to hack the fvwm
code to get what you're suggesting (got not so much spare time, though)

This list is strictly not for developers, but could you try to direct me on
the right path?

I have a good programming experience and knowing what C units in
FvwmButtons needs to be touched could be enough.

I'll take this occasion to thank this list for being so responsive to
requests for help and to celebrate this terrific window manager that at
first, many years ago, frightened me but have conquered me back since only
a few months with its amazing flexibility.

Thank you so much.
Greetings from Italy

Sergio

Hi everyone,
with fvwm 2.5.2, I am trying to write a function that moves a window
to the mouse pointer location. This is what I have com up with so far:

 DestroyFunc MoveToPointer
 AddToFunc MoveToPointer
  + I echo $[pointer.x] $[pointer.y]
  + I All ($0) AnimatedMove $[pointer.x] $[pointer.y]

when I issue this:
 MoveToPointer Xmag

I get a:
    [FVWM][Echo]:  238 348
but the window is moved to +3046+3563

is this a bug?

Thanks,
sa

P.S. heres some more...
[FVWM][Echo]:  271 741
xmag is moved to +3468+7587

[FVWM][Echo]:  0 0
xmag is moved to +0+0

[FVWM][Echo]:  10 10
xmag is moved to +128+102

I suggest to take a look at how "Padding x y" option is implemented and
implement "PressedOffset x y" (or however you will call it) similarly.
Searching for "Padding" in FvwmButtons/*.[ch] should be a good start.

You may parse option args using GetIntegerArguments from libs/Parse.c.
I suggest to make the second integer optional, it may be set to the
first one if omitted, negative values supported, 0 is the current default.
If you need more help, don't hesitate to ask on fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Wait a moment.  It *is* possible to change the icon while waiting
for the application already, at least in the latest development
code.  We recently hacked something into FvwmButtons that allows
to change the text and icons in a running FvwmButtons.  It's a bit
difficult to configure, but it works well.  So, you can bind a
function to the button that changes the icon, waits for the app
and restores the old icon:

  *FvwmButtons: (Icon foo.xpm, Action Function start_foo_func)

  AddToFunc start_foo_func
  + I SendToModule FvwmButtons Icon <button-spec> foobar.xpm
  + I Exec exec foo
  + I Wait foo
  + I SendToModule FvwmButtons Icon <button-spec> foo.xpm

<button-spec> describes which button is changed.  It can either be
a column/row pair ("+1+3").  Or a button number (only buttons with
icons count, top left button is #0).

(config untested).

Bye

Fvwm does not send any events to the application (well, almost,
there are some cases, but these don't play a role here).  The X
server does it automatically.  I'm sure the problem is timing
related:  Fvwm receives *exactly* the same exents in both cases
and thus behaves the same.  But wish interprets the events
differently.  Since the outcome seems to be somewhat random, it's
very likely that timing plays a role.  Applications should not be
written in a way that relies on a specific timing.

The "SendToModule FvwmButtons" syntax above will be changed (enhanced).
I didn't suggest this solution, because it is not generic.

This code does not do what PressedOffset is expected to, it changes an
icon of _one_ specific button _after_ it was activated (i.e. mouse button
released). PressedOffset works when the mouse button is _pressed_ and
until it is released or a window appears (if hangon used). PressedOffset
works when normally Frame is changed from "raised" to "sunken" and also
without a frame (Frame is 0). This functionality is absent and can't be
currently simulated.

Also, if you have 10 buttons that start applications, you should draw
additional 10 icons (not everyone is an artist) and add a lot of code.
Instead of just adding one line: *FvwmButtons: PressedOffset 2 -3".

Another improvement may be to add PressedIcon option (this icon would be
used instead of Icon when a button is pressed). But for users without
additional icons or for users with Frame 0, PressedOffset should be enough.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is there a way to suppress the insertion of before-and-after
separators when a Title item is placed in the middle (not top) of a

Hi,

I am trying to get fvwm to display chinese characters on the windows
title bar.

I installed the latest alpha version 2.5.2, and changed my .fvwm2rc
config file to have the following line:

Style "*" Font StringEncoding=gb2312-1980-0:"-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--0-0-72-72-c-0-gb2312.1980-0"

Also tried without the StringEncoding bit.

When I use mozilla to go to a Chinese website, only chars like "?????
??? ???" are shown on the title bar.

Thanks for any help in advance.

Regards,

Shao.

Do you set environment variables in your .xsession (or .xinitrc depending
on your OS distrubution)?
LANG should be set to something like: zh_CN (or something like that...)

Or if you use gdm (GNOME's version of xdm), you should have a menu to
choose the session language.

I think it looks like this could be the problem.
Also, do you get any error messages from fvwm?

No, setting LANG to anything specific is not required in 2.5.2.
I don't set LANG at all and can see Chinese in window titles.

It should be "StringEncoding=gb2312.1980-0". A dot, not a dash.
It is critical to specify it correctly.

> Also tried without the StringEncoding bit.

Yes, please don't specify StringEncoding, in this case gb2312.1980-0 is
assumed automatically from a font charset.

> When I use mozilla to go to a Chinese website, only chars like "?????
> ??? ???" are shown on the title bar.

I don't have this font, but I have another similar one, so I do:

  Style * Font '-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0'

Then I open mozilla or opera on some Chinese page, say:

  http://www.randburg.com/is/nas_ch.html

choose GB2312 (Simplified) from a View / Encoding menu and see Chinese.
Note, for window title to be refreshed after changing Encoding from both
browser menus, you may need to switch to another tab and return back.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry, it was a typo. I had it right in the config file.

I also got the same font, so I tried what you described above, but still
no luck. Here is a screen shot:

So,  we need more info. Can you send the output of "echo $LC_CTYPE"
and of "locale". Seems you run FreeBSD, this is maybe the reason of
the problem. I think that BSD libc do not has iconv. Do you have
(gnu) libiconv installed on your machine? (if not install it and
recompile fvwm, maybe configure should require an iconv). What
is the version of XFree?

I don't have LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL and LANG defined at all. I did not see any
reference of them in the fvwm manpage. Strangely, FreeBSD does not have
zh_CN.GB2312 locale installed. But I did try with a Big5 font with the
following:

export LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.Big5 LC_ALL=zh_TW.Big5 LANG=zh_TW.Big5

with still the same result.

I thought libiconv is always required in 2.5.2.

Here are the info:

fvwm-2.5.2          Popular virtual window manager for X

iconv-2.0_1         Charset conversion library and utilities
libiconv-1.8        A character set conversion library

The browser I am running is the linux native mozilla and opera. Will
this make a difference at all?

Hi,

I just noticed Red Hat has dropped fvwm2 package from
their latest beta! I think this is outrageous and we
should make an official protest against this
unjustified decision!

I'm going to fill in a bug report to Red Hat's
bugzilla RSN.

You must be joking,  right ?
Why do you think the new computers have huge 
amounts of ram ? To run fvwm ? No
You need something to take advantage of your ram.
Something like Gnome or KDE. That's why they 
are dropping fvwm. In terms of memory usage it 
is not well suited for the new millenium.

Programs these days consume more and more memory 
only fvwm decided: "Hey I can do a lot of things 
without consuming much memory". This is a very
conservative aproach and is not well suited for 
times we are living in :-))

Fvwm has bad habbits. I mean why a program should 
free memory when you have so much at your 
disposal ? :-))

And they will say it's a hardware problem :-))

I hereby submit a patch to fix this problem:

At the beginning of main(), add

malloc(50*1024*1024);

Now FVWM can compete with Enlightenment!

I think you speak about Microsoft Windows. This list deals with neither
Microsoft nor Windows. Please ask on corresponding lists.

Alternatively, specify your FVWM version and unix system.
Providing your fvwm2rc config and a screenshot may help too.

I've filled the bug 900

I've made some progress in tracking its roots but I can't
attach notes to the bug (How can I?) so I'm posting it here:

The problem is in communication between fvwm and module,
where fvwm tries to send WindowConfig with title_height=26,
but the module receives title_height=26*2^16

There is short field title_thickness in the struct FvwmWindow
but is it accessed as (int *)&field from
make_new_vpacket(module_interface.c:912,913,1140).
This may work on x86 but can't work on opposite endiannness machine.

Just to show you what I see (Chinese everywhere), here is my screenshot:

I would like to understand these nifty hieroglyphs.

In this case, you should use a Big5 font, e.g.:

Style "foo" Font -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-*

should load a big5-0 font if you have any which match the previous
pattern.
Note that, as it is say in the fvwm man page, fvwm will display CJK
in the good way only if you use the appropriate locale (or you can
use appropriate (xft) iso10646-1 font + StringEncoding). If not and
you enforce a multibyte font by specifying its charset the rendering
can only be approximative (but not as bad as you get). In fact,
for GB2312 things should work not so bad at all, but unfortunately
not for you and I do not see the reason ...

Maybe you can try to use an iso10646-1 font:

Style "foo" "StringEncoding=GB2312.1980-0:an_iso10646-1_font_with_simplified_chinese_char

e.g., -gnu-unifont-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1 may have
simplified chinese glyph.
You may also try some ttf fonts (you should find/install a ttf font with
chinese glyph and add the path to XftConfig; I may help).

Anyway I would like to find the problems ...

I think that fvwm-2.5.2 compiles and works without any iconv
(I never test this).

Apparently xinerama went into and out again of the OSX/fink version of
fvwmw. "fink rebuild fwm2" solved the problem, largely.

(I'm posting this just so that it goes into the archive.)

Perfect.  Thanks.  I see it now in the man page.

Hi there.
I would like to automatically raise and lower some certain windows,
like for example XClock, FvwmButtons, icon managers, etc. - raise when
the mouse pointer enters them, and lower when the mouse pointer leaves
them.
I asked this already in a previous thread at the end of last year, and
some-when in that thread Dominik Vogt told that he implemented
enter_window and leave_window events in FvwmEvent, and suggested that
I use those.
Since I started using FVWM 2.5, I have the following in my .fvwm2rc:

# Functions to auto-raise / auto-lower only some specific windows:
DestroyFunc	SelectiveRaise
AddToFunc	SelectiveRaise
	+ I WindowId $0 (!raised "FvwmIconMan") Raise
	+ I WindowId $0 (!raised "FvwmButtons") Raise
	+ I WindowId $0 (!raised "xclock") Raise
	+ I WindowId $0 (!raised "xexec") Raise

DestroyFunc	SelectiveLower
AddToFunc	SelectiveLower
	+ I WindowId $0 (raised "FvwmIconMan") Lower
	+ I WindowId $0 (raised "FvwmButtons") Lower
	+ I WindowId $0 (raised "xclock") Lower
	+ I WindowId $0 (raised "xexec") Lower

# Pass ID of window to actions:
*FvwmEvent:	PassId

# For auto-raise:
*FvwmEvent:	enter_window	"Silent SelectiveRaise"
*FvwmEvent:	leave_window	"Silent SelectiveLower"

But then I started having the problem of some windows/widgets
flickering (acting like losing and getting the focus very fast). For
example buttons in GTK+ applications, Netscape's toolbars, and most
noticable for me - Ghostview (gv), which shows the zoom menu (when
selecting an area with the middle button) for only a very short time,
a fraction of a second, and that menu disappears. Also sometimes
"balloon" labels in the pager flicker in the same way, just as some
other windows sometimes.

I started a thread in the FVWM mailing list then, and was told that my
solution - way to do the raising and lowering with enter_window and
leave_window events is the problem. I was told to look up some more.

Since then I looked up, and did not find a solution yet. CTWM (and
partially TWM) let me do that (automatically raise some windows on
mouse entering and leaving) with the AutoRaise and AutoLower settings,
which worked fine, just as I needed, and didn't cause those kinds of
problems.

I want to use FVWM, though, as it is the best window manager for
me. Except this one thing.
Any idea for a solution for me? Can't such AutoRaise and AutoLower
settings (or styles) or the like be implemented in FVWM too?

This is really the main thing that I have a problem with in FVWM right
now... And I would be happy if that issue would be solved.

  Thank you, any help appreciated,
  -- Tom

Speaking of which, the fvwm2 package in RedHat 7.3 seems to be broken.
I could not get the titles on the buttons on my buttonbar to work.  I
tried every possible format for setting the font and labeling the
buttons I could think of.  Also there were no fonts shown in the pager.
Finally I dropped in the source:  configure, make, make install and
everything is working fine.

The fvwm2 package in RedHat 6.2 and 7.2 seem to be fine.

Anybody else notice this?  Anybody get it to work?

RedHat also dropped tin and xv starting with 7.1, two other programs I
can't live without.  I'm starting to learn Debian for this and many
other reasons.

This is indeed my problem. I had --with-iconv-include instead of
--with-iconv-includes, and that made a huge difference.

GB fonts works fine now, but not big5 fonts. Fvwm crashes when I try to
specify any Big5 font. Anyone else getting this?

i can't imagine how could anyone to drop xv if it had been regular
part of an os install/distribution previously!  it's one neat light
weight graphic program  ... wait for it ...  oh, that reminds of the
earlier comments about reason for dropping fvwm.


disclaimer: i use freebsd, haven't ever used linux.  i suppose i
just love xv so much that the efb's comment caused separation
anxiety.

fine. We should be more clear about iconv detection.

This is fixed now (in the current cvs).

But, again the good way to display CJK is either:

- Use the appropriate locale and load font without specifying
the charset or with a charset which matches "the" locale charset.
- Or use iso10646-1 font (core or ttf) with the good set of
char and use StringEncoding=good_encoding when you a load font.

For example with Big5 (with a non "Big5 locale"), all ascii
characters will be replaced by a space (of course when fvwm
does not crash).

The config is part of the source distribution.  You can find it in
the sample.fvwmrc directory.  But I recommend to use fvwm-themes
instead.  It has a similar configuration and is much more
flexible.  There is a link to the fvwm-themes package on our
website.

Actually, your description doesn't sound like you are using fvwm
at all.  FvwmTaskBar can only be at the top or the bottom of the
screen, not on the left or right side.  Other taskbars can usually
be dragged around the screen:  press and hold the first mouse
button over an empty part of the taskbar, then drag it towards the
bottom center of the screen.  The taskbar should jump there
directly or show its outline in the new position.

There are two fatal errors.  First, the X server didn't find a
keyboard and exited.  Second, fvwm was compiled with Xinerama
support, but the Xinerama library is not installed or not in the
library search path.  Fvwm shouldn't have been started by a dying
X server anyway.

I can't remember exactly right now, but I think I posted a better
solution when I added the Schedule command.  It boils down to
scheduling the raise lower commands instead of executing them
directly.  When a command is finally executed, it cleans up the
schedule queue.  This eliminates the race condition if done
correctly.  Perhaps someone else can come up with a link to my
original post?

I remember your last post then, and found it archived on the web at:
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0204/msg00248.html

At the end of that message, you noted that this race condition can be
avoided using the new Schedule and Deschedule commands. Since then I
have made various experiments and tried many possibilities with it
(Schedule and Deschedule), and today I tried some more... But nothing
seemed to work as I expect... Mostly it just got FVWM stuck (waiting
for a click, with a cross-hair pointer) whenever entering a window
which should be raised.

You did not tell exactly how this can be solved with the Schedule and
Deschedule commands. I have been struggling with it and for some
reason just did not manage to get it right... Maybe I am missing
something obvious... Could you please provide some example, or more
detail on how exactly to do it?

I am using FVWM (2.5.3) from CVS, latest as for yesterday (last
updated yesterday).

Sure, just give me a little more time.

BTW, don't update to today's CVS - the code dumps core at startup.

I had similar problems with Pager, and figured it might be a multi byte font
and locale problem. Did you get

	[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset fixed, trying 'fixed'

and other font complaints in your error output?

If so, putting:

	SetEnv LANG C
	SetEnv LC_CTYPE ""

near the front of the config fixes some font problems -- you still get the above
first error, but other font problems go away. Of course, so does your locale
in window titles, etc..

If this is the problem, and it went away for you when you recompiled then that
suggests the compiled binaries might be locale dependent, which would sort of
inhibit a global binary distribution (e.g. Red Hat distro...) a bit! Could
this be one reason why Red Hat are giving up on our favourite WM? Can anyone
comment on this?

Thank, John Latham

Thank you very much for your reply and efforts to help... This setup
behaves a bit differently than my expected setup, but I suppose that
when I look at it I will be able to hack it a bit to what I want
exactly...
There is one problem, though... This does not solve the problem I have
with flickering windows/widgets... I removed all my setup related to
it, tested that it does not happen, then inserted your snippet, and
tested, and the flickering happens again...

A simple test to check the problem, which always shows it for me if it
is there, is with gv (Ghostview). If you have it installed, try the
following with this setup - open some PostScript file in Ghostview,
then select some area by dragging with the middle mouse button (or
equivalent). A zoom menu is supposed to show up. Without those
auto-raise setups, it works fine. With either your snippet, or my
previous setup, you will see the menu for a fraction of a second, and
then it will disappear. This should not happen.

So I still have this problem...

That makes me think of this:

if (malloc(50*1024*1024)) {
  fprintf(stderr, "You have too much RAM to run fvwm.  Run Gnome instead.\n");
  exit(1);
}

Ah yes.  Ghostview probably wants to grab the pointer when the
zoom window is opened, but since fvwm is in a complex function,
the pointer is already grabbed.  Instead or retrying, gv gives up
immediately and closes the window.  On my machine, the problem
goess away when I add this line at the front of the
autohide_window function:

  + I PointerWindow (gv) break

so the complete function looks like this:

  DestroyFunc autohide_window
  AddToFunc autohide_window
  + I PointerWindow (gv) break
  + I Schedule $[AUTO_HIDE_DELAY] $[AUTO_HIDE_GROUP] hide_all
  + I PointerWindow (FvwmIconMan) schedule_raise
  + I PointerWindow (FvwmButtons) schedule_raise
  + I PointerWindow (xclock) schedule_raise
  + I PointerWindow (xexec) schedule_raise

Fvwm breaks out of the function fast enough so that gv can grab
the pointer.  Unfortunately, the pattern (gv) applies to all
ghostview windows, somewhat negating the effect of the autohide
setup.

Hi there.
Please read my comments below:

The problem is not only with gv. The whole problem of flickering is
still there, including the problems with buttons in GTK+ applications,
Netscape toolbar, borders of some windows being automatically raised
like XClock and FvwmIconMan, FvwmPager balloon titles, etc. I only
gave gv as an example which always shows the problem.

I do not see why gv trying to grabbing the pointer should be a
problem, especially that other window managers (e.g. CTWM) have such
a feature (automatically raise and lower) which doesn't cause those
problems. I don't see exactly why FVWM should grab the pointer for
that.

This is a workaround for gv, which also reduces a bit from the
functionality of the auto-raise and auto-lower (disabling them on that
window), but I wouldn't apply this workaround wherever I see such a
problem... I think this should just be fixed.

This really sounds like a sub-optimal specific workaround for
me. Couldn't this problem be fixed?
I am not enough of an expert in X11 to tell exactly... But since other
window managers, like CTWM (I keep giving it as an example because
that's one I used lot beside and before FVWM) have this function
(auto-raise and auto-lower) working fine, without flickering, and not
causing problems with pointer grabbing with gv, I suppose that could
be done with FVWM too...
Couldn't there just be added two styles - AutoRaise and AutoLower,
which would do that, and just that, and do it simple without
flickering and problems, needing scheduling and the like?

I apologize for this style of critique... FVWM is really great and I
love it, by far the best window manager I know now. I just would
really like to have auto-raise and auto-lower working fine and simple
with FVWM already...

Unfortunately, the gv problem I saw had little to do with
flickering.  If other apps have this problem, I need more
examples.

Because fvwm is executing a complex function.  The pointer is
always grabbed during function execution (and has to be to
prevent funny and hard to debug problems).  Don't forget we're
not using well tested, documented features here.  After all, using
enter and leave events is a real hack (and *slow*).  Moving the
pointer across the desktop can trigger dozens of enter and leave
events.

No.  Complex function = pointer grabbed.  Any application that is
stupid enough to not retry grabbing the pointer when it's needed
and unlucky enough to try it at the wrong time has a problem.
Correct fix = fix gv.

Sure.  Use FvwmAuto.  Of course you'd have to switch to
SloppyFocus or MouseFocus and lose ability to enable the feature
only for selected windows.

That would just move the problem into the fvwm core.  CTWM might
also have an auto-raise feature, but I bet it's based on *focus*
changes too and not on the pointer entering or leaving the window.
It's much easier to code, but it doesn't work with ClickToFocus.

Anyway, I think it's possible to modify the lines I posted to
disable and scheduling of commands while the pointer is outside
any of the autoraise/lower windows.  Will take some time.

Hi,

I am experiencing some problems with both FVWM 2.5.2 and the snapshot of
20020704. However, i'm not sure if these problems are due to fvwm or to
other apps.

First of all, when i add the line 
    "FontPath unix/:7101"
to my XFree config file (to be able to use my truetype fonts), and i try 
starting fvwm, i only get an hourglass, and nothing happens.
Removing the line, starting fvwm, and then using xset fp+ unix/:7101 to
use xfstt seems to work fine.

Another problem i am coping with, even with older versions of fvwm, can
be seen on http://spike.ulyssis.org/tmp/snap.png
When i move my mouse pointer quickly over the menu items, there seems to
be a 'refresh' problem, leaving some blue spots of my highlight
rectangle near the right arrows. The problem doesn't occur with XFree
3.3.6.

Does anyone know what might cause these problems ?

thanks,
Remko

PS: I run Debian (unstable) with XFree 4.1.0 and xfstt 1.2.1.

Hi there,

I realized a strange behaviour using xmms which uses a  shaped  window
in  version  2.5.1.  xmms provides an option "double size" which shows
the window zoomed in double size. 

If I start xmms in normal size mode and provide this option afterwards
the  contents of the window are zoomed but the window size remains the
same which looks very weired and is quite use less.  If  I  start  the
window in double size I can switch form double size to normal size and
from normal size to double size without this strange behaviour. I  put
a screenshot on the web:
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/download/xmms_problem.jpg  to  make  it
clearer. 

The problem does not occur with version 2.4.6 but it  occurs  as  well
which  version  2.5.1  even  if  shaped support is disabled (configure
option --disable-shape). 

Any hints.

Uwe

Sorry about my last post, the errors i described don't occur in the
snapshot any more. I just loaded the wrong version.
Also, i should have used the bug tracking system instead of mailing it
here. Sorry about that.

Well, there are other examples, like I noted, with GTK+ buttons,
Netscape toolbars, balloon titles in FvwmPager... And sometimes
windows being automatically raised (e.g. FvwmButtons) start
flickering - getting raised and lowered over and over again frequently
in a short time...
I do not have exact tests for those examples, though, as they do not
always happen - only once in a while... But if you use this setup for
a while, with some activity with automatically raised and lowered
windows, then you'll probably see it a few times.

I would ask now - why does this have to be a complex function?
Couldn't it be, instead of a complex function, just some
AutoRaise/AutoLower style?

By enter and leave events, do you mean events of FVWM (FvwmEvent), or
events in the level of X? After all, FVWM does a lot of things on
enter and leave, including focus, changing window styles, etc etc.

If we are talking about X events here... Then, well, I find it hard to
believe that it is not well tested and documented... As it is used a
lot and seems to have not principle problems...

Also, why a real hack (and *slow*)?

Again, why do automatically raising and lowering have to be
implemented using a complex function?

Well, might be... But, well... I still find this a bit weird,
considering that some other window managers handle that quite well,
also with gv... And, as I said, the problem is not only with gv... gv
is just a test that always shows the problem.

I tried FvwmAuto for that, and those were exactly my problems... I do
have my focus following the pointer, except windows which have the
ClickToFocus style enabled... And mostly, those are the windows I want
to automatically raise and lower...
That was what my first post on this subject (back near the end of
2001) was to say... That I need a bit more than FvwmAuto can do, at
that time...

Why would it? If the problem is that FVWM grabs the pointer in a
complex function, than be it a simple style, and some of it is solved
already...

No, actually it is based on the pointer entering and leaving the
window... As I said, that was one thing that CTWM did just well, fine
without problems as I expect it...

> It's much easier to code, but it doesn't work with ClickToFocus.

By the way, what is actually the big difference for that matter
between the mouse entering the window and the window getting focus?
Originally you said that it is a problem with the synchronization
between FVWM and X, so that while FVWM gets the event from X another
window has the pointer in it already... Can't FVWM just check that the
pointer is still in the window it got the event for from X before
applying such a function?

> Anyway, I think it's possible to modify the lines I posted to

Well, that will probably help a lot, but still, some of that problem
("flickering", etc.) happens also with windows that are automatically
raised and lowered... So this would still leave some of the
problem...

  Thanks again for the efforts in helping and the reply, I really hope

Upgrade to the latest xmms release.  Versions prior to 1.2.4 are
*very* buggy in their window handling.  The latest release works
fine.

Then please try to pin it down.  I have no such problems with the

Uh, but I won't.  I hate auto raising.  I can't use my desktop
with it.  :-)

Well, what would you win with that?  You'd still need a complex
function to select the windows to use.  No.  Either you give up
most of the flexibility or you have to use complex functions.

It's roughly the same.

Yes, but it *does not* restack windows triggered by these events.
That's the one thing that does not work

Let me explain.  You probably think that one EnterNotify event is
sent when a window is entered and one LeaveNotify event when the
window is left.  But that's not true.  Let's assume we have two
overlapping windows A and B.  The most simple case would be
windows without any children.  In fvwm, the visible window still
consists of a lot of sub windows:  The top level window (frame),
the Wparent" window which contains the client window, and more
than a dozen decorative windows.  Let's assume the pointer is in
the client window of A and is moved across the title bar into
window B:

 - pointer moves into the titlebar of A
   Events:
     leave client A
     leave parent A
     enter title window A
 - Pointer moves into the border of A
   Events:
     leave title window A
     enter border A
 - Pointer moves directly into the client window of B.
   Events:
     leave border A
     leave frame A
     enter frame B
     enter parent B
     enter clent B

And it get's much worse if pointer grabs are considered:  when an
application grabs the pointer, it can specify a grab context
window.  For example, if you open a menu (by a key stroke), the
client, parent and frame of B are left and the menu window is
entered, *even* if the pointer is not over the menu.  The reverse
events occur when the grab is released (leave menu, enter frame/
parent/client).  The old window even gets enter events if the
pointer is no longer over it - immediately followed by the usual
leave events and the enter events on the new window hierarchy.
(BTW, this grabbing issue is what makes the gv zoom window vanish:
the pointer is grabbed by fvwm ==> zoom window receives a leave
event and closes.  It should ignore events triggered by grabs).

> Also, why a real hack

Because the typical fvwm user won't be able to use this feature in
a sensible way.  You have to have a lot of experience in X
programming to use it.  Just look at me:  I've been hacking fvwm
for four years and know X event handling very well and I still
can't easily come up with a good solution.

> (and *slow*)?

Because enter and leave events are by fare the most common events
(apart from mouse events).  When they are actually communicated to
a module, a lot of useless traffic is created.

No, let's get this straigt:  the gv problem is *completely*
different from any problem with windows competing for the top
position on the window hierarchy.  It's really just a gv bug.  The
developers forgot to grab the pointer when that popup window
opens.

(much later)

I've made a patch to FvwmAuto so that it can handle enter and
leave events instead of focus events.  Try this with the latest
cvs code:

  FvwmAuto 0 -passid -enterleave \
    "Silent selective_raiselower raise" \
    "Silent selective_raiselower lower"

  DestroyFunc selective_raiselower
  AddToFunc selective_raiselower
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmIconMan) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmButtons) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xclock) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xexec) $0

(You need the file libs/Flocale.c from the 4th of July - the
current one is buggy and may crash fvwm).

I am mistaken here.  These events do play a role.  For some reason
(I think to make some other application happy when it starts as an
icon), I forced an UnmapNotify event being sent to the application
before the icon was created.  I'm mystified as to why wish thinks
the UnmapNotify negates the MapNotify that arrives later.
Maybe it processes events out of their proper order.  Anyway, I've
added a faked MapNotify event that is sent right before the
UnmapNotify, and wish seems to be happy now.

Please consider reporting this problem to the wish developers.  I
still think it's a bug in there that may well show other symptoms.
In general processing events out of order - especially events
that are of related types like MapNotify and UnmapNotify - is
dangerous.  It usually works as long as not much is happening on
the desktop, but when things get really busy it may cause
problems.

Hi there,

I was just wondering if there is any particular reason that there is no
OpaqueResize style (that I know of)? OpaqueMove is nice, but I really
dislike those inverted-color lines that appear during a resize, and I'd
really like to see an OpaqueResize.

Other than that, Fvwm is great. I'll never go back to any other wm ;)

D'oh! I should learn to RTFM before I post to the list. ;)

I think Fvwm comes with about 136,000 words worth of manpages, or
something like that. Fun, eh?

ResizeOpaque is great, exactly what I wanted. Now Fvwm is perfect ;)

Thanks.

Maybe not quite... I'm having some trouble with FvwmPager. Not sure if
it's an FvwmPager problem or what, but in fvwm 2.5.2 it doesn't seem to
be able to render the pages for anything but the first desk.

I find it kind of hard to describe. I use 3x2 pages per desk, but in
fvwmpager only the first desk (the 0th desk) actually has 3x2 pages...
all the other ones are just blank. The desk is the size of 3x2, but
nothing is drawn in the desk (no page outlines, no windows, nothing).

Here's a screenshot of it misbehaving:

http://members.shaw.ca/feztaa/pics/fvwmpagerbad.png

I guess I could settle for only having one desk, but that's kind of
annoying.

Is this a known issue? Or am I just doing something wrong?

How do you start the pager in your .fvwm2rc?

You should use a line like this:

+	I	Module FvwmPager 0 1

in the startup funcion.
0 and 1 tells the pager the first and last desk to display.

HI

I tried the latest snapshot

fvwm-snap-20020706.tar.gz 

but it seems to crash on startup. I tried
using no fvwm2rc file, so that a basic menu
should appear, but X crashes before fvwm starts
up.. Please let me know if you need any more
info.

Hm.  Please strip down your config file as much as possible so
that this still happens and post it here.

Hi there...

Well, with GTK+ buttons, sometimes the buttons act like the pointer
enters and leaves them a lot of times in a short time period, getting
highlighted and un-highlighted - the same with Netscape's toolbars.
With FvwmPager, when the pointer goes over a window, and then over
another window, in a short period of time, sometimes the balloon
showing the title of the window starts to flicker - appears and
disappears continuously for a short time.

I could only pin those problems down to the actual lines in the
.fvwm2rc which do the automatic raising and lowering.
As I said, it does not always happen... But in some time with this
setup, you notice it...

Oh... Well, I don't really like auto raising of my windows either... I
just use it for some little windows like the icon manager,
FvwmButtons, XClock, etc. which I want to see without "effort"
(clicking, etc.) at times but I don't want them to consume space all
the time...

Well, I suppose just use those windows with the style applied to
them...

Why should that be the one thing that does not work, though?

Wow... I didn't know it's that complicated... (I hardly ever dealt
with those aspects of X - which do not draw in some client window or
the root window, or something)

Why does the pointer being grabbed cause the window to receive a leave
event?

Oh... understood... Not that I know that there are a lot more enter
and leave events than I thought...

I got it now... For some reason I had the idea that it was the same

Wow... That works great... Almost.
It does it as expected, responsive, and there seems to be no
flickering with it...
But, the problem with gv, which I now completely realize that it is a
different problem, is still there - it doesn't happen when I just
automatically raise and lower all windows... Apparently because of the
pointer grabbing deal... But I don't want to have all windows
automatically raised...
Could there be a way to not have to use a function for that? Make it a
style that FvwmAuto checks or something? That would be perfect then...
Or maybe there could be a way to cause that specific function
(selecting the window) not to grab the pointer...

Hi,

I'm using fvwm2.4.0 and when I use the following config

*FvwmPager: Label * Current

I expected from the man page that when I switch desk, the pager label
would change to reflect the Current desk.  What happens, however, is that
desk 0 is always labeled Current.  Am I reading the man page correctly?


While I'm on the subject, is there a config option to allow say 3 desks to
show up in the pager with the center one being the current one?

The only thing I could find was invoking FvwmPager as

Module FvwmPager * X

and whatever I put for X was always ignored.

Thanks,

Tom

No, I don't think so.  How should the pager know the names you
expect if all you specify is 'Current'?  The line above means
"Label all ('*') desks as 'Current'".  You have to label all the
desks you want to use manually:

  *FvwmPager: Label 1 desk1
  *FvwmPager: Label 2 desk2
  *FvwmPager: Label 3 desk3

And start the pager with

  FvwmPager * *

No.

Hi there,

I would like to create a panel for X-Chat using FvwmButtons, but i seem
to have some problems. When X-chat is started, it gets the title
    "X-Chat [1.8.9]: my_nick @ irc.myserver.org / #mychannel"
So, i define a panel
    *FvwmButtons: (Icon mini.xchat.xpm, \
                    Panel(position top,right,delay 0,UseOld,NoClose) \
                    "X-Chat*" Nop)
However, X-chat doesnt seem to hang itself on the button. The wildcard
should be correct, because
    Style "X-Chat*" NoTitle
removes the title from the X-Chat window. Is there a solution to this
problem ?

A second problem i have with the FvwmButtons module is the following: i
define a button just identical to the one above (i.e. with UseOld and 
NoClose). When i restart FVWM with the application of the button visible, 
everything is ok: i can still click the button to show/hide the application. 
But, after i restart FVWM when the application is in the hidden state, 
clicking the button doesnt do anything. The application is still running 
however, but i can't get a hold of it anymore. Is this normal ?

Thanks a lot,
Remko

I had version 1.2.4 running and upgraded to 1.2.7 but still  the  same
problem. I had a try with windowmaker and fvwm-2.4.6  which  show  not
that problem. I also realized that shaped windows like xmms or gkrellm
are hard to move. If I try to move them quickly they  alway  remain  a
couple  of points after the mouse pointer. Shaped windows appear as if
the are very sluggish. Moving shaped windows consumes  a  lot  of  cpu
power  as  well. I even had a try with fvwm-2.4.6 and windowmaker both
move xmms much faster than version 2.5.1.

Greetings.

First off, taking a queue from Maddog Hall, many thanks to the Fvwm
developers. I try other WMs from time to time, and keep coming back.

I'm using v 2.2.5

What I would like to be able to do is bind a key to a function which would
raise my fvwmbuttons. For the sake of having as much usable screen area as
possible, I have it set so that it can be obscured by other windows. (no
autoraise going on, and sometimes I completely obscure it anyway)

Style "FvwmButtons"	NoTitle, NoHandles, StaysPut, Sticky, \
			CirculateSkip, BorderWidth 0, \
			WindowListHit

So, I can warp to it from the window list, or edge-flip and get to it that
way, but I'm hoping for a faster method. But looking through the man page,
the closest I can come to this is `WindowId 0x34567890 Raise' (or warpto),
except that I don't have the window ID. Is there a function I've missed
which will return the window ID so that I can use it in a key binding? Or
maybe a SendToModule command to tell it to raise itself?

I'm starting it up this way:

AddToFunc InitFunction     "I" Module FvwmButtons
AddToFunc RestartFunction  "I" Module FvwmButtons

I realize that a GetWindowID("string") would suffer from the issue of
possibly matching multiple windows, but I could give FvwmButtons a unique
title at startup, and find it that way, I think.

Advice appreciated.

As I said several days ago on this list, this is a known problem in 2.5.2
and 2.5.1.

Any multi-desk pager (FvwmPager 0 3) even without a config will show it.
The initial drawing of FvwmPager was completely broken at some point.
I fixed all problems in a single desker, but not in a multi-desker.

Regards,
Mikhael.

That's not what I came up with:

feztaa@feztron:/usr/share/man/man1$ {
--> for i in fvwm* Fvwm*  
--> do
--> name=$(echo $i|perl -pi -e 's/\.1$//')
--> man 1 $name|cat

--> } | wc

26,466 lines, 136,635 words, 1,292,843 characters. Of course, lines
isn't meaningful here because man autowraps; the wider your terminal,
the less lines you'll get. Also, characters isn't meaninful either,
because the more lines you have, the more spaces there will be to make
up the indentation. So really, words is the only measurement that is
useful ;)

Ok, here is the config file that is as stripped as it can possibly be
while still recreating the problem:

DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmPager 0 1

Those three lines in the .fvwm2rc file, with nothing else, causes this
behaviour.

But, on further inspection, Switching to another page or desk, allowing
the pager to go offscreen, fixes it. Of course, this is not possible
when it's sticky, which is how I want it.

Okay, then maybe the man page is written incorrectly?  I find this in the
man page for FvwmPager:

       *FvwmPager: Label desk label
              Assigns the text label to desk desk (or the current
              desk if desk is "*") in the  pager  window.  Useful
              for assigning symbolic names to desktops, i.e.


My interpretation of the first sentence is that if I do

*FvwmPager: Label * my_label

that the current desk should be labeled "my_label".

I guess I'm misunderstanding this sentence...  As for the labels for the
rest of the desks, I'm finding that by default they are labeled "Desk #"
where # is the desk number.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi again,

I have been coping with a specific problem ever since i started using
fvwm one year ago. For some reason, from time to time my key bindings
stopped working, and closing windows by clicking on the button in the
top left corner of the window didn't work either. Because i couldn't
reproduce the error, i didn't mention it (yet). However, i seem to have
found the reason: going into 'Scroll Lock' mode seems to change some
things that make fvwm ignore these events. It's a mystery to me how i
get into that 'scroll lock' mode, but pressing scroll lock seems to
solve the problem every time (and pressing it again causes the events to
be ignored again).
Is there a solution to this ?

cheers,
Remko

Are you saying that the bug is still in the post-2.5.2 development
code?  I don't see any problem.

Wow, so much code just to cout words.  With zsh:

  $ wc **/*.1

That's all :-)  Of course it counts formatting instructions too.

Oh dear!  You've lived with the most frequently encountered
problem for a year without knowing that the solution is written in
big friendly letters right at the front of the fvwm FAQ. ;-)

Yes.  The one I recommend is to disable the scroll-lock, num-lock
and possibly caps-lock keys conpletely.  From our FAQ (note that you
need at least fvwm-2.4.0 for the IgnoreModifiers command):

-------------------------- snip ----------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.  You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings.  With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in your configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore.  If you do not have a lightning fast machine or very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers.  So do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server.  The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then.  To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.
   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.  If you disable the CapsLock key in your keyboard map in
   this way, you can speed up fvwm a bit by removing the Lock
   modifier from the list of ignored modifiers:

     IgnoreModifiers
-------------------------- snip ----------------------------

Don't hesitate to ask for further help.

Ah, sure.  I shouldn't have replied without re-reading the man
page.  The '*' applies to the desk that is currently shown when
the pager is created.  If you start the pager while desk 2 is
shown, the label is applied to desk 2.  If you'r on desk 345, it's
applied to desk 345.  It's not dynamic.

Sure.  FvwmButtons does not allow wildcards at the moment (expect
that to change once I finish answering my email), so you have to
specify the window title exactly.  Fortunately, you can also use
the window's resource ("xchat") or class ("Xchat"):

  *FvwmButtons: (Panel (...) "xchat" Nop)

I guess you found a bug here.  FvwmButtons forgets to spit out the
panel when it dies.  This will be fixed in the 2.4.9 stable
release and the 2.5.3 development release (and in tomorrow's CVS
snapshot).

Um, you're using 2.5.1?  Bad choice - and I fear it's even worse.
You don't happen to have a snapshot that was mad prior to 6th of
March?  That explains the problem with slow window movement.  It's
upgrade time again ;-)  2.5.1 (and the earlier snapshots) don't
even deserve to be called 'alpha' quality.

You should consider upgrading to 2.4.8, the latest stable release.
It has a lot of fancy new stuff - and maybe equally important -
the 2.4.x series are the only supported stable releases.  Now to

The WindowId command is mainly used with modules like FvwmEvent or
FvwmAuto.  They have an option to append the window id to the
commands they send to fvwm.  Also, you can reference the window id
with the '$w' variable in commands, for example:

  Mouse 1 5 n Echo $w

Prints the window id when title button 5 is pressed.  It's usually
only needed in complicated setups.

Exactly -- my way doesn't count formatting stuff. It's not really that
hard, all I'm doing is taking the .1 off the name so that man will
display it, and then counting everything. And I don't know if you store
your fvwm manpages somewhere other than the default location, but
that would count all the words in all the manpages that I have ;)

I don't know about the rest of you guys, but Vim (to me) is the One True
Editor, and whoever made the syntax highlighting file for the fvwmrc
either a) hasn't updated in years or b) was really lazy and didn't
incorporate half of the things that need to be highlighted.

Unless somebody knows of an accurate, up-to-date fvwm.vim file I can
use, I'm going to go and make my own. Anybody?

I am going to have to try with 2.5.2 and tell the results.

Oops. Didn't see that one :( Then again, it took me a year to find out
that it was due to the modifiers that things stopped working. I
still don't understand why these modifiers get turned on from time to
time. 
Thanks for the tip !

Another small question: Is it possible that DGradient doesnt work in the 
development versions ? I have a line
    MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 128 2 grey50 50 grey95 50 grey50
but it doesnt seem to do anything since i upgraded.

Thanks a lot,
Remko

I've made it as bulletproof as I could, but I found no way to
prevent the gv problem and have the full functionality at the same
time.  At least no reliable way.  You can try either this one:

  FvwmAuto 0 -passid -enter \
                     ^^^^^^
    "Silent selective_raiselower raise" \
    "Silent selective_raiselower lower"

  DestroyFunc selective_raiselower
  AddToFunc selective_raiselower
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmIconMan) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmButtons) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xclock) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xexec) $0

This works fine with gv, but windows are not lowered when the
pointer enters the root window, only when it moves into another
window.  Or you can break out of the function for gv windows
again:

  FvwmAuto 0 -passid -enterleave \
    "Silent selective_raiselower raise" \
    "Silent selective_raiselower lower"

  DestroyFunc selective_raiselower
  AddToFunc selective_raiselower
  + I WindowId $1 (gv) break
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmIconMan) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (FvwmButtons) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xclock) $0
  + I WindowId $1 (xexec) $0

I'm interested in more feedback about this.

It works fine here.  What version did you upgrade to?  If you
switched to using colour sets for menus, the MenuFace style does
not work anymore.  You have to use the builtin Colorset command to
change the gradient (2.5.x)

  Colorset <colorset number> DGradient 128 2 grey50 50 grey95 50 grey50

or FvwmTheme (2.4.x):

  SendToModule FvwmTheme Colorset <colorset number> ...

If you can't figure it our yourself, send me your config file so I
can take a look at it.

Bye

So,

  4.1 without xtt works fine?
  4.1 with xtt works fine?
  4.2 without xtt works?
  4.2 with xtt is sluggish?

Is that correct?  Are you actually using an xtt font?  If so, what
happens when you switch to a normal font?

That would probably depend on your cooperation.  Switching XFree
releases isn't something we do often.

Then you unfortunately have to live with the options that were
compiled into the rpm.  We can't supply one rpm for each
combination of options (millions).

I tested this with the latest development code, and there is
definitely a bug somewhere.  Sometimes the msmaug MenuStyle is
applied to the wrong menus, sometimes it's not applied to the
correct menus.  It seems completely random.  When I scroll through
my RootMenu, sometimes the submenus get the menustyle and
sometimes they don't.  It's clearly a bug.  I'll look into it when
I have the time.

That command is not correct:

  $ xdaliclock -24 -noseconds -visual best -memory low \
    -bg deepolive -fg palegold -font \
    -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-15-*-100-100-*-*-*-* \
    -geometry 60x20
  zsh: no matches found:
  -*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-15-*-100-100-*-*-*-*

Since the font name contains wildcards, you have to quote it:

  $ xdaliclock -24 -noseconds -visual best -memory low \
    -bg deepolive -fg palegold -font \
    "-*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-15-*-100-100-*-*-*-*" \
    -geometry 60x20

I'm not using colorsets.
It's definitely a bug. The problem is that i can't seem to pinpoint the
reason for it. This is what happens:
- When i use anti-aliased fonts in my menu (e.g. with MenuStyle * Font 
  "xft:Arial:size=11"), i never get the gradient. 
- When i don't use the anti-aliased font, sometimes the gradient shows,
  sometimes it doesn't. What i get all the time is the thing seen on
    http://spike.ulyssis.org/tmp/snap.png
  The blue rectangle for highlighting the active menu item doesnt get
  cleared, and leaves a trace behind.

cheers,
Remko

Yes, if you do "cvs update -D '2002-07-06'" and keep the current Flocale.c
the initial drawing of non-first desks (grid and mini-windows) is
incorrect.

Your latest fixes (probably related to MapNotify) indirectly fixed this
problem, but it may appear again.

The problem is that until 2002-07-06 the very first HandleExpose calls
DrawGrid that calls XDrawLine, everything with correct parameters, but
only the first desk grid is shown, so I guess Desks[desk].w window itself
with non-zero desk is not visible. It becomes visible on any operation
(shade, move).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Wow!  The code positioning the pager subwindows is *completely*
broken.  I wonder how we could overlook that for so long.  The
patch you made recently only suppressed a few symptoms but did not
address the real problems, Mikhael.  I'm going to clean up this
mess when I'm back at home.

Hi!

I have the following rows in my rc:

# Sets Alt + Page Up/Page Down to run Maximize-Func.
Key Prior       A       M      Maximize-Func
Key Next        A       M      Maximize-Func

and they work great, there is just this one thing; I like to use the keyb=
oard
alot and when I run Maximize-Func I need to touch the mouse a bit in
order to make it work (I guess it has something to do with that the
screen has to be redrawn or something). Anyway, I was just wondering if
anyone had some small tip && trick to make this happend whitout the
involvment of a mouse... :-)

Thanks.

FWIW, the vim that came with Slackware 8.0 has a syntax file for .fvwmrc
files...as for accurate up-to-date, I can't vouch for it.  (Sorry I'm
not at home so I can't give you the vim version number.)

If this saves you effort, excellent; if not, just ignore me.

Everything works beautifully :-) xmms can switch between sizes and
shaped windows can be moved as expected.

Great work, thanks for that.

Take a look at your Maximize-Func, it requires a mouse. Different
combinations of "C", "D", "M" or "H" require a mouse differently.

Write "Maximize" instead of "Maximize-Func" or use a function that only
has "I" commands if you want to bind it to a key.

Regards,
Mikhael.

FWIW, here are the first few lines of the fvwm.vim syntax file
found in Red Hat 7.3 (fvwm-2.4.6, vim-6.1).

Hi,

     I'm trying to use TitleStyle to give the titlebars theme
support and I'm running into some problems. I'm using a tool
called fvwm-theme to set my themes although the .fvwm2rc I've
attached has had the PipeRead command calling fvwm-theme replaced
with its output.

     What I'm getting when I run with this rc file is the themed
buttons in the title bar but a blank grey area between. I don't
even get any text in the center of the title bar anymore. The
xpm files all exist (I get errors if I move/remove any of them)
so thats not the problem. If I comment out the TitleStyle cmds
setting Active{Up|Down} and Inactive then I get text (and a slightly
different background color.

     I even got the correct titlebar once when I first started
playing with this when I forgot to specify NoTitle on the gnome
panel window.

     So if anyone has any suggestions on how to sucessfully theme
the titlebar I would appreciate it. I'm running 2.5.2 in conjunction
with Gnome 1.4 on a Sparc/Solaris 2.8 machine.

Thanks,
Gordon

The MultiPixmap patch is a victim of a large scale decoration
drawing code rewrite.  It does not work at the moment.  The last
release in any versions after 2.5.1.  I'm still hoping that the
author eventually get's around fixing it since my time to do it
myself is very limited right now.

Well, that's the problem. I compiled and installed vim from source
(which is how you tend to install things when you built the whole sys=
tem
that way ;), and the fvwm.vim syntax file that *comes*with*vim* tends=
 to
highlight things that are not valid fvwmrc commands, and doesn't
highlight things that are valid commands. I'd post a screenshot, but
it's barely worth it ;)

Hmm, where do I get 2.5.3 from? fvwm.org says 2.5.2 is latest. You don't

Speaking of memory usage, has anyone thought about looking for some
memory leaks?  Ok so I've been a lazy Debian user and I'm not up to
what's in CVS (2.4.7 right now), but here's what I'm seeing (from top).

  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE SWAP  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
  668 david      8   0 15300 8948 6352  3440 S     0.0  1.9   3:35 fvwm2
after restarting fvwm, same windows etc
  668 david     10   0  2468    0 2468  1348 S     0.1  0.7   3:36 fvwm2

Let's see, 15MB vs 2.4MB, could be.  It could also be fixed by now in
CVS.

Does anyone have a favorite memory leak checker?  I've tried two, but
I haven't been to impressed with them.  One was called memusage (at
least on SuSE), and said what was allocated/freed and sizes but I had
no idea where the leak was, or glibc doing exit instead of free..exit.

Yes, we regularly run Purify or a similar tool before major
releases.  In the mean time I frequently use efence to detect
other memory problems.

Unfortunately, the information about memory usage that top shows
has little to do with the real memory consumtion.  Chances are
good that you didn't see a memory leak at all.

> Does anyone have a favorite memory leak checker?

My favourite is insure++, but the company totally freaked out:
they demand about EUR 10000 for a single, CPU locked license.
Since we couldn't convince them to sponsor a license for our work,
we usually run Purify - which is vastly inferior to insure++ - but
we have a few people on the list who can run it.

As /bin/sh unless told otherwise.  You're right, /bin/sh should
run this command, but quoting is a good idea anyway.

No.  Swallowing works very reliable if two conditions are met:

  (a) The application starts up fine.
  (b) The window has the title/class/resource specified in the
      hangon string.
  (c) The window is not swallowed by someone else.

If it does not work, make sure each of these conditions are met.

Ok, I have whipped together an extremely alpha-quality syntax file for
Vim. You can get it from here:

http://members.shaw.ca/feztaa/fvwm.vim

Probably save it to here: /usr/share/vim/vim61/syntax/ (if you are using
vim61). The location could be different depending on your distro. Just
do a 'locate fvwm.vim' if you're not sure. You might want to backup your
old one before overwriting it with this.

Anyway, all I know is that this highlights the syntax of my own fvwmrc
perfectly. I went through the manpage for 2.5.2 and set it up to match
pretty much everything that's there. There's probably a ton of stuff
that I got wrong because it wasn't in my own fvwmrc and I couldn't test
it properly. 

So if you guys see any problems with it, send me your fvwmrc (so I can
see the problem firsthand), tell me whats wrong, and I'll try to fix it.
I'm not terribly interested in backwards compatability with old config
syntax, but if there's enough demand I'll put it in.

I saved it to ~/.vim/, this was enough.

It is still too old (I don't know how old was the previous one, I don't
use vim), many new commands and options are not recognized.

It would be nice if obsolete commands like IconPath, PixmapPath, *Font,
*Color, WindowDesk, and obsolete Style options would be highlighted
using light red or some other annoying color.

I will not list all problems, if you want to improve it, run it on dozens
of files in fvwm-themes-0.6.1, it uses only the correct 2.4.8 syntax.

Actually there is one more condition (a feature or a bug).

If you have the following line (without UseOld):

  *FvwmButtons: (Swallow "xload"   `Exec xload -fn fixed`)

and a window matching "xload" already exists when you start FvwmButtons,
you end up with 2 xload windows, none is swallowed. The only relable
way currently to swallow something new is:

  *FvwmButtons: (Swallow "xload"   `StartApp "xload" "xload -fn fixed"`)

  AddToFunc StartApp
  + I All ("$0") Close
  + I Exec $1

Uh, yeah... I based it on the manpage for 2.5.2. I highly doubt that
much has changed between 2.5.2 and today's CVS. Unless you're using
2.4.8 and there are some /Old/ commands that I didn't include.

My best guess here is that the default fvwm.vim that comes with vim (the
crappy one) is overriding your ~/.vim one.

Maybe once I get the current commands perfected, I'll put in some
highlighting for obsolete commands.

You are right, I didn't though I already have one fvwm.vim. :)

It is much better now.

There are small glitches:

  * Back ticks may be used for quotes too.
  * Variable matching (following the dollar) is incorrect, it should be
    either one strictly defined char (not \w), digit, asterisk or dot,
    or several \w and dots in square brackets [].
  * ModuleSynchronous should behave like Module.
  * Module aliases (after asterisk) may contain dash, dot and slash.

There are more things to be highlighted, but nothing critical.
Seems like a good work.

Regards,
Mikhael.

These errors are to be expected, as I don't have any of these in my own
fvwmrc ;)

I'm looking at some of the config files from fvwm-themes, and everything
is slowly getting better and more accurate.

Question: For variables, can they be uppercase as well? like $C or
$[FOO]. I'm not sure on this. The manpage doesn't say they can't, but as
far as I can see, it doesn't show any that are.

Thanks, it's getting better. Just wait until it's finished ;)

Our own variables may be lower-cased only, shell variables may be
in any case.

Escaping of backslash, dollar, hash, quotes and others is not easily
simulated. Another problem is that different commands may parse their
arguments using different rules.

Yes, "*FvwmPager-TheLeftOne: ".

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris 8.

I have:

Style * MwmFunctions
Style * MwmDecor
Style * NoOverride

I have an application that turns off MWM_FUNC_MOVE, but I can still
move it around by dragging the title bar or using the Pager.  If I
turn off all FUNCs and DECORs except MWM_DECOR_TITLE, same result.
If I turn off everything (emulating a "splash screen"), I can still
move it around with the Pager.  In all cases the window is rendered
correctly (visually), it's just that I can't seem to shut off
moves.  What am I missing?

How about what I suggested - making it a style - if the window has
that style applied, FvwmAuto will automatically raise and lower it,
otherwise it won't? Or maybe make the list of windows to automatically
raise and lower a parameter for FvwmAuto? Is there a problem doing so?
And also, it would be useful to provide some option to disable the
grabbing of the pointer in specific functions.

I suppose you mean -menter here, as in the FvwmAuto manual page I see
no mention of an option named '-enter'...

I do not know what it might be, but here this behaves really weird.
I replaced the '-menterleave' option with '-menter', and do not see
any change. Auto-raised windows are still lowered when the pointer
enters the root window, and the problem with gv isn't solved.

I tried that too. Does not make any difference either. The menu still
immediately disappears.

> I'm interested in more feedback about this.

Another weird thing, since updating from CVS a few days ago, FvwmPager
behaves a bit weird. Inactive windows (windows not having the focus)
have a black background, and look rather different than they used to
(they used to have the background color defined in the BackColor
style).

Can you post some sample source so that I can try it myself?
Also, please try if it's still a problem with 2.5.2.  I've
reworked the MWM hints code sindce 2.4.x.

It's like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  All this
additional code just because of *one* buggy application?  Complex
functions already provide a far better solution.

Right.  The hack I made to inform FvwmAuto of the pointer entering
the root window was too aggressive.  I've modified it a bit and it
should now cooperate nicely with gv.

It depends on timing.  It was worth a try.

Please update to the latest cvs.  I've been working on the pager

Nah, I don't actually want to /install/ fvwm-themes, so I just
concatenated all of the config files that come with it.

Highlighting shell variables sort of defeats the purpose of only
allowing one-letter variables, and bracketed variables. 

For now I think I'll only highlight Fvwm variables, not shell ones.
Maybe I'll work out something in later versions.

Hopefully I'll be able to rig up something that works.

Ok, fixed. I haven't had a chance to look at the entire fvwm-themes
config (it's 15474 lines), but so far it seems to look pretty good. More
things need highlighting, but the stuff that is highlighted looks great.

Well, I suppose this isn't the only buggy application.
Is it that much code to add for that?

Yeah, I suppose... But they don't provide a solution for what I need
here, yet...

Cool... This seems to cooperate nicely with gv now, working just the
way I like it... This still does lower auto-raised windows when the
pointer leaves them for the root window though, but that's actually
what I want... So when that is fixed, I will want something to have
the current behavior again.

Well, in my case, I use FVWM on more than one machine, quite many,
actually, in some different sites, so timing can vary...

I updated from CVS now, but it is still the same problem...

  Thank you very much... I'm advancing (with lots of help from you and

Yes.  First a new style, the code to update windows on style
changes, next we would probably add options to conditional
commands, then someone will want to use the style in the
WindowList and some of the modules, and so on.  Just look at the
flood of options to the conditinal commands compared with the
options of the WindowList command and you know what I mean.  Such
things tend to grow without limits.

That may be so.  I'm readily willing to enhance the feature set of
complex function, conditional commands and the like.  This way,
*all* the modules and the fvwm core benefit, not just one feeble
module.  For example, take the PointerWindow command.  Before I
added it, there was no way to run functions on the window below
the pointer.  Today it's one of the most important conditional
commands in my config.  Without it, we could only dream of the
autoraise functionality based on enter/leave events.  But with it
plus the new ENTER/LEAVE packets, implementing autoraising reduced
to a couple of code lines.  That's the way I like new features:
small, doing a single task well, very flexible.  Much better than
ten new module options.

Hm, you're probably running an old version of the module against
a newer fvwm.  Similar things often happen to me when module and
fvwm version don't match.  Are you sure FvwmPager got installed
correctly?

Discussions of this kind are one of the best ways to find out what
we really need in fvwm.  I wish everyone had the patience and
endurance to continue them to a satisfying end.  I appreciate your
a lot.  Not only could we find a nice solution, but also came up
with a valuable addition to the FAQ and perhaps even fvwm-theme.

Maybe some part the leaks come from the Xlib. I think that the
debian package is compiled with --enable-multibyte. There is some memory
leaks in XCreateFontSet: each time a font is unloaded ~4kb is lost (this
depends on the font, with an utf8 locale and if you use an iso106464-1
font with a big coverage this may be a lot more).

For example:
- if you delete a window ~4kb is lost (0kb with 2.5.2) 
- if you change your font and you have 20 windows, ~80kb is
lost (only 4kb with 2.5.2).

I've recently sent a patch to the XFree developers but no feedback yet ...

Note that I do not claim that all the leak come from the Xlib,
it is just a possibility. So one question and one query:
- Do you do something special regarding the fvwm config
(as regularly changing some config parameters)
- Can you send me your config file(s) if this is possible.

I appended my .fvwm2rc. I have a few global keybindings, which allow me to
resize, move and destroy windows. But I also use UserModeLinux (something like a
vmware for Linux and free). In this UserModeLinux I also have a fvwm2 with the
same Configuration running. So I want this global key strokes disabled for this
specific window. Is that possible? At the moment I press the Num Lock outside
the application ... so that my host fvwm keystrokes are disabled (but the
UserModeLinux don't get the enabled Num Lock), so that I can use my keybindings
in the client application ... I am looking for a Style which disables the global
key strokes for a specific application ... again :)

Please reply personally to me because I am no longer on the list.

Greetings,
	Thomas

Sorry, at the moment there is no way to do this at the moment.  Key
bindings are always globally applied to all windows.  Even if they

Well, what do you mean - pulling your leg?

I am just saying, that now with -menter, it works the way I want it,
but that isn't exactly the way it should work, as documented in the
manual page.
So I suppose some-when it will be 'fixed', to its intended behavior -
not lowering windows when the pointer leaves them for the root
window. But that is not what I want (I want those windows lowered when
the pointer leaves the root window too).
So unless something else is changed then, like the behavior with the
-menterleave option to workaround/fix the problem with gv and grabbing
the pointer, I will not have it the way I want, which is right now so
because -menter behaves a bit different than what's documented...

Well, I'm pretty sure... I listed the running processes after
restarting FVWM, and the FvwmPager which is running is the one
installed by the last make install (checked)...
Also now I tried building from scratch, removing any previous
installation I had locally, and installing of clean, being sure that
there wasn't any FvwmPager left somewhere before, it still looks that
way.

Doesn't it happen for you? I checked, and even with the default
configuration (running as 'fvwm -f no-rc'), and nothing done except
popping up a pager, it looks different...

Well, I want both to have my working environment convenient for me,
and FVWM to keep being the best window manager overall - my window
manager of choice - and keep getting better. It's already great, but
it can get yet even better, and there are always possibilities for
improvement.

I should (will now) look at the FAQ again and see what has changed /
been added (except for what I see when looking at the ChangeLog
files)...

I never yet took the chance to look at fvwm-theme... I will some-when
check it out and see better what it is about...

HI

when I issue this command once:

Style * Font '-b&h-lucidabright-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-p-*-*-*'

from the console, the font changes correctly, but when 
I issue it for a second time, fvwm and X crashes. Is this
a known bug in 2.5.3?

Please call it pre-2.5.3 or the cvs code.

There was a crash bug on May 05-06, but it was fixed.

Hi,

Sorry if this bug is already mentioned. I have the following key binding
in my fvwm config:

Key quoteleft   A       M     Module FvwmPager -transient 0 3 Warp

It worked fine in fvwm 2.4.*. In fvwm 2.5.2, only the first desktop is
shown correctly, for desktop 1, 2 and 3, no virtual screens are shown,
only a blank rectangle with the desktop title.

If my description is not clear enough, I can supply a screen shot.

Thanks.

Shao.

Pulling somebody's leg means roughly to mislead someone for fun.

The man page is correct, but I did not mention that moving the
pointer from any window into the root window now generates an
ENTER_WINDOW packet too.  FvwmEvents needs a notice about this
behaviour too.

Er, first you say that "it works the way I want it" and a few
lines further down "So unless ... I will not have it the way I
want"?  So is the behaviour of -menter what you want or isn't it?
Automatic lowering when entering the root window can be disabled
by checking if the passed id is that of a real window or not (in
other words:  in the called functions without any changes to
FvwmAuto).

Hm, default configuration.  All my modules use colour sets.  That
effectively hides any windows with BackColor.  Can you give an
exact date for "a few days back"?  Originally I thought this meant
before the FvwmPager fixes I made, but I'm not so sure anymore.

Nothing yet.  I'll do that later.

My interpretation is that he is satisfied with the current behaviour,
but believes that the documentation is not consistent with the behaviour
(whether or not this is true I have no idea), and is afraid that you
will change the behaviour to match the documentation, at which point it
will no longer behave the way he likes it. And when you "fix" it (to
match the documentation), he wants you to add an option to let him
change back to the current behavior.

But I could be wrong.

Wouldn't it be possible to write a function that would check if the
current window is a certain window, and if so unbind all the
keybindings, and if not (or if no window is focused), rebind all the
keybindings, and then use FvwmAuto to run this function instead of
raising/lowering the window? (FvwmAuto lets you choose what to do when
focus changes, iirc)

Yes, this is a known problem. FvwmPager is pretty much totally borked in
2.5.x ;)

But, if you don't use a transient pager, and you don't make it sticky,
switching desktops and switching back will make it render the other 3
desktops properly ;)

For now, do what I did: make your desktop bigger (more pages), and then
just use the one. If I remember correctly, it's fixed in CVS, though.

I'm sorry, I joined this discussion late, and probably missed a bunch of
stuff.

What are you trying to accomplish, exactly? You want some windows to
autoraise, but others not?

Does setting some windows to "StaysOnBottom" while just using FvwmAuto
module not work? ;)

New version now available. Most problems that were found have been
fixed; lots of new stuff still needs to be added (I want to get it to
highlight the BugOpts options, for example). Anyway, enjoy ;)

Yes, that is possible, but it's vastly inefficient and probably
very slow (depending on the number of key bindings, the number of
ignored modiefiers and the connection to the X server).

Oh... You'll have to forgive me, I'm not a native english speaker, so
I didn't understand exactly the relation with the context until now.

So doesn't this mean that now every leave event is accompanied by an
enter event? What is the difference now, between using the -menter
option and the -menterleave option?

Well, it works the way I want it, now. But that seems to be not
exactly the way it should work, according to the documentation /
manual page.
So when/if it will be changed, to work the way it should work, then it
won't work the way I want it, and I will be unhappy again... :-)

Or, to say it otherwise, what makes me happy now, probably should not
be that way...

The behaviour of -menter is what I want, because it seems to be the
same as the behaviour of -menterleave, only without the problem with
gv and grabbing the pointer...

On the other hand, now that you say that the pointer leaving a window
for the root window also generates an enter event for the root window,
that might be the appropriate behaviour... But then what is the
difference between the -menter option and the -menterleave option?

"A few days back" is here since the 6th of July, to the 11th of
July... In those times, FVWM updated from CVS head (I updated about
twice a day) had that problem with FvwmPager.
On the other hand, FVWM updated from CVS a half an a hour ago (12th of
July, 2002, 12:10 AM GMT+03), seems to have fixed this...

Well, back when you said you updated a lot of the FvwmPager drawing
code, some time after that it wasn't fixed yet. But apparently there
were some FvwmPager fixes today/yesterday too, and those seemed to
have fixed it...

> Nothing yet.  I'll do that later.

Oh... well, I'll check it out once in a while...

Neither am I, but I have a new dictionary and enjoy looking up
phrases I'd use in German :-)

That would be the ideal solution, but I'm not convinced this is
the case at the moment.  Handling of the corresponding X events is
very complicated.  There may still be situations where an enter or
leave event is sent without the other.

> What is the difference now, between using the -menter
> option and the -menterleave option?

With -menter FvwmAuto only handles enter events.  The LeaveCommand
is triggered for the previous window when an enter event arrives.
With -menterleave only leave events trigger the LeaveCommand.  As
long as these events arrive in pairs, -menterleave is just a waste
of resources.

Don't worry.  I've already changed the documentation to reflect
the current behaviour.

Yes.  But it is only the same because we specifically wrote the
function this way.  It's not an inherent feature of FvwmAuto.
There may still be situations where you might want to treat enter
and leave events separately.  If we did not want the raise-when-
root-window-entered behaviour, we could just change the function
to ignore this case.  No code in the module needs to be touched.

I found the bug.  FvwmPager was accessing the wrong information
from the packet informing it of the new window.  That happened
because the size of a variable in the packet changed and the pager
accessed the data by byte offsets in the structure :P

1) Marking a window StaysOnBottom just so it will not be auto raised is
bad, it should be raised, just not automatically.

2) FvwmAuto in all versions except for the current cvs works on focused
windows only.

This means that FvwmAuto does not work on NeverFocus or ClickToFocus
windows (most of persistent modules like FvwmButtons, FvwmPager,
FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan and so on are best when marked NeverFocus).

In the latest snapshot, FvwmAuto may work on a enter-leave basis, not
on a new focus basis, this solves a problem of autoraising NeverFocus
or ClickToFocus windows.

Mikhael.

Is there a way to turn off key & mouse bindings when entering a
particular window?  I've looked through some of the documentation but
haven't found anything but I may have looked hard enough yet.  ;-)

For a simple example, suppose I have

        Key     F1              FSTWI           N               RaiseLower

and I'm running fvwm2 locally.  I'm also using a vncviewer to attach
to a remote Xvnc which is also running fvwm2.  What I would like to
do is when I'm in the vncviewer window, I want the "F1" key event to
pass into the vncviewer to the remote fvmw2 instead of being acted upon
by the locally running fvwm2.

Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.

Regards,
dcj

This problem is fixed in the latest snapshots and the fix will be included
in 2.4.9 and 2.5.3. It "worked" in 2.4.* just by an accident.

There are some other problems with FvwmPager in the current cvs, but
its initial drawing that you mention is correct now.

I want a shell script to be executed everytime I change to a different desk.
In the case of
Key Right A SC Desk 1
this is easy enough, just build a function around that "Desk" call.
But how do I do this if I switch desks by clicking in the pager?

What I want with this is implement multiple desktops in OSX. I want an fvwm
desktop dedicated to MS Office &c.

Of course there will be a problem getting infrmation to flow the other way,
but that's a later concern....

I can say for sure that fvwm 2.4.7 is leaking memory per program
window.  I don't think the cvs version 2.5.3 is leaking, but I can't
be completely sure.  I just ran a bunch of xterms and it seemed fine.

I've included a program to ponder, and I'll suggest using Xnest if
anyone wants to run it, or an X session they don't want to use for a
while.

  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE SWAP  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
23686 david      9   0   856  240  616   616 S     0.0  0.1   0:00 FvwmPager
23677 david      9   0   488  112  376   376 S     0.0  0.1   0:00 FvwmTheme
23653 david      9   0  321M 310M  10M 11060 S     0.0  3.5   2:49 fvwm

The program is simple enough, but here's what it does anyway.
1. open X connection
2. create window
3. destroy window
4. go to #2 n times (I'm using 1000000)
5. close X connection=20

I'm just throwing this program out for anyone to look at if they are
interested, I'm not going to look into it myself.  I tried it against
kde maybe I didn't wait long enough (over night) but kde didn't
recover where fvwm fully recovers, although it doesn't give the memory
back to Linux.

Sorry I sent the wrong version of the program.  It is fine if I add
the nanosleep in there, apparently it gives fvwm enough time to
cleanup, so if you want a big fvwm you have to remove the nanosleep
line.  Sorry about the confusion if any, at least this way people will
have to read instructions to cause problems.

Hi all,

Hopefully this is a straightforward enough question.  Is there a port
of fvwm for MacOS X (v10.1.5), and more importantly where is it?

According to 

http://www.apple.com/scitech/unixports/

... there's a port of v2.2.4, but the link takes me to
http://www.opendarwin.org and I can't seem to find it anywhere there.

Thanks in advance

2.2.4 is really really old, but if you need it, here it is:

  http://dl.sourceforge.net/gnu-darwin/direct_download/packages/

I can find a trace of 2.4.7, but it only contains man pages. If you want
fvwm packages for your OS, ask OpenDarwin people, or install from sources.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Go to fink.sourceforge.net and install fink. Then you can get fvwm2 version
2.4.7 without any problem. It works fine for me.

And you want fink no matter what. Trust me on that.

I used to use fvwm and when I clicked on a window in the pager, it would not
only switch to the desktop in which that window appears, that window would
also get the focus.  I'm now using fvwm2, and when I do the same thing I
still switch to the desktop, but the focus does not change until I click
on that window.  Can anyone tell me what I need to do in order to have the
focus change when I click on a window in the pager?

Thanks,

I think that currently the only way to achieve what you want is to click
on a mini window in the pager twice, once using the mouse button 1 and
then (without moving a pointer) using the mouse button 2.

Maybe sometimes clicks in the pager will be configurable.

Mikhael.

Hello all,

I just installed FVWM 2.4.8 (compiled from source) on a Solaris 8 box with 2
screens attached to it. Even though the Xserver supports xinerama, I am
trying to configure fvwm to run nicely on similar 2 screen boxes with
solaris 2.6 (no xinerama support). As expected, fvwm2 loads up separate
instances on both screens and I can move the mouse pointer between them.
Now, if I try to drag an xterm window from the (physical) screen on my left
to the (physical) screen on my right, the window outline pops back in to the
same left physical screen, from the left border. It's as if the window
"wraps around". At the same time, however, the mouse pointer changes to the
physical screen on my right and continues going that way. I hence move the
window outline on the left screen while the pointer is on the right screen.
Is there any way I can force the window AND pointer to just stop at the
right hand edge of the left screen when dragging while still having the
pointer go from desktop to desktop when it is moved on its own?
I have a binary of fvwm 2.2.4 which does just that, even when executed with
the same .fvwm2rc file.
Are there any compile time options I could enable?


Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks

-Philipp

Or, he could turn on SloppyFocus for the pager, like this:

*FvwmPager: SloppyFocus

Then, whatever window is under the mouse in the pager will become
focused. Clicking to another desktop would take him there, and the
window he clicked on would be focused. That might be more what he wants,
no? ;)

In releases prior to 2.5.x, fvwm's behaviour is mostly random when
the pointer is not on the managed screen.  I have just committed a
patch that should restore the old behaviour in the 2.5 branch.
Could you please try out the next snapshot (tomorrow) or fetch the
sources from CVS and try it out?  I can't test this myself right
now.  If it works, the same patch will be part of the 2.4.9
release.  Could you please also test what happens when you do the
same, but resize the window instead.

Bye

Hello,

I got the latest sources from CVS today (2.5.3), compiled and installed
them. However, FVWM still exhibits exactly the same behaviour as specified
below. I re-compiled, taking all options out that I could, but the behaviour
is still there. I tested the resizing and it too behaves as before, namely
making the window bigger until I reach the right-hand end of the screen,
after which the resize frame snaps all the way to the left hand side and is
one pixel wide, after which the window size increases again (hope this
description is intuitive enough).
Any other ideas?

Thanks a lot for the quick reply to my previous mail.

Cheers,

-Philipp

In releases prior to 2.5.x, fvwm's behaviour is mostly random when
the pointer is not on the managed screen.  I have just committed a
patch that should restore the old behaviour in the 2.5 branch.
Could you please try out the next snapshot (tomorrow) or fetch the
sources from CVS and try it out?  I can't test this myself right
now.  If it works, the same patch will be part of the 2.4.9
release.  Could you please also test what happens when you do the
same, but resize the window instead.

Bye

Hi there,

I wonder if it is possible to use fvwm to insert (often used) text in
applications as it would have been typed by the keyboard.

Some text one has to type very often e.g. the own email address or
account numbers.  It would be nice if this text can be inserted by a
key stroke or a mouse click.

Any suggestions how this can be achieved? Thanks in advance.

If this is possible one could think about a dynamic menu which holds
for example 10 often used entries. New entries can be added by a fvwm
function the oldest will removed automatically. Maybe someone has
already implemented something like this.

Uwe

Such things exist, but this is far outside the scope of fvwm. Try
freshmeat.

Actually making this menu is not that problem. The point was how can
strings inserted in applications as they where typed.

Why not just use a clipboard? Then the strings are inserted with
something called "the middle mouse button". You can get fancy clipboard
applications that hold more than one string at once. Try freshmeat.

I found a program called xclip which may be used  to  achieve  what  I
want.  It can set and read the xselection. So thanks for the clipboard
hint. 

I tried to use it in conjunction with the fvwm FakeClick  command  but
without success. Maybe someone has an idea why it does not work:

DestroyFunc InsertTextInApplication
AddToFunc InsertTextInApplication
+ I Exec echo -n $* | $[HOME]/bin/xclip
+ I FakeClick press 2 wait 250 release 2

AddToMenu InsertPopup 
+ "Insert 109141029347" Function InsertTextInApplication 109141029347

When I select the menu entry above nothing happens. But I can insert
the number above by pressing the middle mouse button afterwards.

As the description of the FakeClick command in the man page says,
there is no general solution to send clicks from fvwm to
applications.  On one hand, applications may (but rarely do)
ignore events that were not generated by the X server.  And on the
other hand events are sent to a specific sub window.  They do not
propagate from the window on the bottom to the hierarchy up to the
first window that wants these events.  There is no way to find out
the window in which the application expected the click.  That's
the reason for the "depth" option of the FakeClick command.  But
one depth setting may be good for one application and fail on
another one.

I'd like to change my cursor ("x") when it is outside a command window to
something else (a pointer perhaps).
How can I do this?
Thanks.

You can do this outside Fvwm with:

xsetroot -cursor_name gumby

or using the Fvwm command:

CursorStyle ROOT gumby

The cursor name "gumby" can be replaced with any of the names
in /usr/X11R6/include/X11//cursorfont.h.  (The actual location
depends on your system.)

Check the man pages for fvwm and xsetroot for more information.

Hi All,

Changing to SuSE 8.0 Linux, the default resizing behavior as described 
in man fvwm2:

       Unless  the standard defaults files are modified, pressing
       mouse button 1 in the title or  side-bars  begins  a  move
       operation  on the window.  Pressing button 1 in the corner
       frame pieces begins a resize operation.  Pressing button 2

has changed, i.e.: windows are not moved when pressing mouse button 1 
in the side-bars, but resizing starts. I want to have the standard 
behavior (i.e., move the window, resizing only when in the corner 
frame pieces). How do I get this using my .fvwm2rc config file?

Please help!
Thanks in advance!

Hans-Georg

I have a script that outputs a current colour set.
For example the outpu looks like this:
Colorset 0 bg rgb:60/a0/a0, fg rgb:ff/ff/ff
Colorset 1 bg rgb:d3/d3/d3, fg rgb:00/00/00

further I have defined:

Style * ActiveColorset 0
Style * Colorset 1

That script is run using PipeRead during start. But get all window borders
white with black text (I think black on white is default for unitialised
colour sets).
But if I paste these lines (from the output) manually into an FvwmConsole,
it works.
But if I run my function SetColors, which is run from init in the
FvwmConsole I get only white and black like above.

Does it have to do with PipeRead?

Any idea of what's wrong?

The colorset commands should be the first commands in your config
file.  For performance reasons, colorset updates are ignored
during startup when a lot of things happen.  This is probably the
reason for your problem.

Very nice look.
Sorry for the long delay, but I finally did get around to adding
your screenshot.

The betas have png support.

I am not sure why it is named standard, "minimal" would be a better name.
The minimal defaults (when there is no configuration at all) are not
supposed to be fully featured or convinient, just to have move and resize.

The behaviour that you describe, i.e. the mouse button 1 resizes a window
anywhere on the frame is pretty standard. At least that is what I saw in
most of window manager configurations including fvwm and (tried in Xnest)
the default configurations of mwm, sawfish, enlightenment, wmaker, icewm.

I suggest you to add a window move by binding it to mouse button 2.
You may add these or similar lines to your ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc:

  Mouse 1  SF  A  Resize
  Mouse 2  SF  A  Move

Here is an example of some more featured window frame bindings:

  Mouse 1  SF  A  ResizeOrRaiseOrShade
  Mouse 1  T   A  MoveOrRaiseOrShade
  Mouse 2  SF  A  MoveOrRaiseLower
  Mouse 2  T   A  MoveOrRaiseLower

  AddToFunc ResizeOrRaiseOrShade
  + H  Resize
  + M  Resize
  + C  Raise
  + D  WindowShade

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseOrShade
  + H  Move
  + M  Move
  + C  Raise
  + D  WindowShade

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseLower
  + H  Move
  + M  Move
  + C  RaiseLower

Mikhael.

Well, for most of configurations when windows and modules are started in
StartFunction or InitFunction, the colorset commands may be anywhere in
the config file, even at the end. This is the whole point of these init
functions, they are started after the whole initial configuration is read.

And it is not critical if a colorset is defined (or changed) after some
color is already used. There will be a redraw at most. This is the whole
point of dynamically changeable colorsets. :)

The order of colorset commands can't be a reason for the original problem.

Hi, there!

I would like to have the Style StaysOnTop in the Window-Ops Menu (where
Raise, Move, (De)Iconify etc. live), so that I could assign this Style to
every window I wish. I've tried much, but I can't figure out, how to do
that... Can You help me? Thank you

Ok. Several issues here.

StaysOnTop just like Layer is one of the not many style options that
require RecaptureWindow to be applied. This works in 2.4.x:

  AddToMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps
  + I "StaysOnTop"    StyleAndRecapture $n StaysOnTop
  + I "StaysPut"      StyleAndRecapture $n StaysPut
  + I "StaysOnBottom" StyleAndRecapture $n StaysOnBottom

  AddToFunc StyleAndRecapture
  + I Style "$0" $1
  + I All ("$0") RecaptureWindow

But this is broken in the current cvs, these style options do not work.

Anyway, if you want only to change layers of one specific window, not
all windows with the same name, you may do it without Style:

  AddToMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps
  + "StaysOnTop"    Layer 0 6
  + "StaysPut"      Layer 0 4
  + "StaysBottom"   Layer 0 2

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

How to change the default look of icons in fvwm, when their size depend

on icon pixmap, to mwm-like style. In Mwm all icons have equal size on
quare base.

Thanking in advance,

Yes, you're probably right.  Anyway, it's still a very good idea
to define your colour sets before anything else.  There can be a
large number of unnecessary redraws if you define color sets last.

Sure.  This doesn't work.  You have to remove the "I" bits first
;-)  ALthough it probably happened by accident, I think it is
correct that recapturing a window does not modify the window's
layer.  To do this at run time, use the layer command.  With the
same reasoning, changing the "Sticky" and "StartsIconic" styles
with Recapture should be no-ops too.  Remember, I'm still trying
to obsolete and finally remove the Recapture command.

Or if you want to changle the layers of all windows with the given
name:

  AddToMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps
  + "StaysOnTop"    All ($n) Layer 0 6
  + "StaysPut"      All ($n) Layer 0 4
  + "StaysBottom"   All ($n) Layer 0 2

I recommend not to promote any configs that use the Recapture
command anymore.  As far as I know, it is not recessary to update
any styles and can be avoided in all other situations too.

Recapture = buggy, inefficient, stupid, visually disturbing... (I
could continue ranting about it forever).

There are 2 different solutions.

1) Disable program-specific icons (there are several style options,
ask if you need a help) and define icons of equal size for all
applications, the wm-icons project includes several such icon sets.

2) In pre-2.5.3 use "Style * IconSize 48 48", this does not resize icons,
but pads or strips to 48x48 if needed.

Mikhael.

The question is why "Style X Layer 6" is not applied immediately at the
first place. Then it would be irrelevant whether RecaptureWindow changes
a layer or not.

Just to make it clear that this is not the same as the Style examples that
are at the top of this message, because it only changes the layer of the
windows currently on the screen. If such window is closed and the "same"
one is open, the new one forgets the changed layer unlike Style.

I think I knew more cases when Recapture is required, but here are four.
The first two are used in fvwm-themes, the last two is the reason to have
Recapture and RecaptureWindow in menus:

1) + "StaysOnTop" FuncFvwmStyleAndRecapture $n StaysOnTop

2) + "Rearrange icons" All (CurrentDesk Iconic) RecaptureWindow

3) If you have for example, Style "user@host" Sticky, and this title
   "user@host" is set by a shell prompt after a window is captured, you
   need Recapture (the only way) to force this style on new terminals.

4) If not for other things Recapture is a more powerful Refresh that may
   help in discovering bugs in dynamical Style/BorderStyle/Colorset etc.
   A lot of bugs reports in 2.3.x were: X only works after a Recapture.

No problems, but it solves several cases, removing it is not an
immediate option.

Mikhael.

In other words: in a recent development snapshot or 2.5.3 and
later once it is released.  It does *not* mean "in versions prior

Because someone - most likely me - thought that to change the the
layer of a window, one should use the Layer command, not the
style.  From style.c:check_window_style_change():

  /* nothing to do for these flags (only used when mapping new windows):
   *...
   *   use_layer
   *...
   */

The style would have better been named "StartsOnLayer" (along
with "StartsSticky"), augmented with
"RecaptureHonorsStartsOnLayer" and "RecaptureHonorsStartsSticky".

Make it a function:

  + "StaysOnTop"    ChangeLayerAndStyle "$n" 6

AddtoFunc ChangeLayerAndStyle
+ I All ($n) Layer 0 $1
+ I Style $0 All ($n) Layer $1

With the UseStyle and UseDecor stlyes.

See solution above.  No recapture necessary.

Yes.  But it's really just a hack that exploits random behaviour
that was never designed this way.  It would be much better to
implement this with Place Again.

[later]

The new option "Icon" to the PlaceAgain command just places the
icon again, duplicating the effect of a recapture:

  AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange
  + C Iconify off
  + C All (CurrentPage, Iconic) PlaceAgain Icon

No, we don't need a recapture here.  You can simply replace the
"Recapture" with "Stick on".  No style changes needed at all.

No, not an immediate option, but a medium to long term goal.

Hi,

this is my first posting to this list and I hope I am right to ask
questions about Fvwm2 and FvwmTaskBar here. :-)

Two questions about FvwmTaskBar:

When a Window is deactivated or minimized the taskbar button of this
window is pushed out. That's ok. However, I the case that the window is
minimized the task bar button also changes its background color to
white! How can I change that? This seems to have nothing to do with the
attributes 'Fore', 'Back', 'Hilight', ...

If you click to the screen then the root menu pops up right when you
push down the mouse button. So, you can then just move the mouse
(holding the mouse button down) and trigger the event with releasing the
mouse button. However, you can't do that with the start button of the
taskbar. Here the menu is shown only if you click-and-release the mouse
button and later click again on an item. So you click two times. Is
there a way to popup the start command menu right with the 'mouse down'
event and not 'mouse click'?

Thank You
 Felix

Yes, this is the only relable place for such questions.

Do not IconFore and IconBack as specified in the man page work for you?  

I would suggest to use colorsets instead to specify any colors in FVWM.
Then you may share them among different modules.

  # tips/balloons in modules
  Colorset 16 fg black, bg bisque

  # standard item
  Colorset 17 fg black, bg #c0c0c0  # optionally use Pixmap here

  # active item
  Colorset 18 fg white, bg blue3, hi #40b0f0, sh navy

  # iconified item
  Colorset 19 fg black, bg grey51

  # pointed item (only relevant for FvwmIconMan, not FvwmTaskBar)
  Colorset 20 fg black, bg #c0c0c0

  *FvwmTaskBar: Colorset      17
  *FvwmTaskBar: FocusColorset 17  # or 18
  *FvwmTaskBar: IconColorset  19
  *FvwmTaskBar: TipsColorset  16

  *FvwmIconMan: Colorset          12
  *FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset     17
  *FvwmIconMan: FocusColorset     18
  *FvwmIconMan: IconColorset      19
  *FvwmIconMan: SelectColorset    20
  *FvwmIconMan: FocusAndSelectColorset 20

I don't think there is a way except for changing the sources.

In FvwmButtons in 2.5.2 you may use ActionOnPress option for this.
After all FvwmTaskBar may be emulated using FvwmButtons that swallows
FvwmIconMan and some other buttons.

Mikhael.

To be honest, it is pretty difficult to create FvwmButtons that simulates
FvwmTaskBar in a perfect way, but if you can live with the fact that there
is no limit on a maximal item width or that there is no space between
items, it is possible. Like on the attached screenshot, it automatically
takes the exact screen width. Don't ask about its configuration, it is not
finished yet. Or if you really want, try fvwm-themes cvs.

I did small enhansments in FvwmIconMan and FvwmButtons in 2.5.2, but
these modules should be much modified to support more features. I can't
promise, but maybe I will have a time in august to add several features.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I forgot to mention one feature that FvwmIconMan misses - tips.

It would be nice if someone extract the corresponding code in FvwmTaskBar
into a tip/balloon library with API like SetDelayedTip, DisableDelayedTip.
Or maybe create a new FvwmBalloons module that serves tip requests.
This would be useful in FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager (it has
balloons, but not the delayed ones). Any generous volunteer?

Hi!

I'm running:
FVWM version 2.4.6 compiled on Apr 23 2002 at 09:11:36
with support for: XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM

on Solaris 8, 2 monitors, no xinerama.

Every so often, fvwm stops responding to key presses, like alt-tab or front
(F15).  I can't find any pattern as to when it happens.

any ideas??

Yes.  Your Num-Lock, Scroll-Lock or Caps-Lock key is pressed.
>From the fvwm FAQ:

--------------------------- snip ---------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.  You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings.  With XFree86 and fvwm version 2.4.0 or above, the
   right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key, Mouse or
   PointerKey commands in your configuration file and the number
   of modifiers you want to ignore.  If you do not have a
   lightning fast machine or very few bindings you should not
   ignore more than two modifiers.  So do not ignore scroll-lock
   if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server.  The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard
   map.  Pressing these keys has no effect then.  To re-add them
   try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by
   xmodmap.  Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command
   for further details.  If you disable the CapsLock key in your
   keyboard map in this way, you can speed up fvwm a bit by
   removing the Lock modifier from the list of ignored modifiers:

     IgnoreModifiers

  it's probably numlock (or some other modifier), check the faq

I think it is explained well in the man page, but I agree that it may look
strange for the users new to FVWM. The syntax of the Mouse command is
explained in the Mouse entry of the "COMMANDS FOR MOUSE, KEY AND STROKE
BINDINGS" section. And the syntax of user functions is explained in the
AddToFunc entry of the "COMMANDS FOR USER FUNCTIONS AND SHELL COMMANDS"
section.

Hello,

I am making experiments with FvwmIconMan to simulate a taskbar (this is
due to certain problems I have with FvwmTaskBar). FvwmIconMan is
swallowed into FvwmButton and displays all TaskBar buttons in a
horizonal row.

Can I somehow change the border style of these buttons? Neither 'flat'
nor 'up'/'down' fit the rest of my desktop theme. Can I use pixmaps
somehow for the different states of the buttons? I wonder how this works
since the button's widths can change.

I also don't find a way to avoid these small extra "button" drawn on top
of the normal IconMan's buttons when a window is minimized. Is this made
as a substitute for missing icons? Can I switch that off?

Thank you for any hint!

Felix

Hi,
I'm running FVWM 2.5.2 on a RedHat 6.2. with fvwm-themes-base-0.6.0-1

When starting fvwm via fvmw-themes
(entry in .xintrc:
exec /usr/bin/fvwm-themes-start
) I see this error message on the console:

"[FVWM-Themes]: Starting FVWM under the main fvwm-themes session
FvwmTheme is obsolete, see the Colorset section of the fvwm(1) man
page [FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmNetHints' in
ModulePath '/u sr/libexec/fvwm/2.5.2'"

1:
How do I get rid of this error?

2:
Is there a chance that there will be a new RPM for
fvwm-themes-base to get rid of the error?

To help myself for the first error ("FvwmTheme is obsolete") I changed
.fvwm/themes-rc and .fvwm/themes/personal/colors according to man fvwm
(Colorsets):

#######################################################


In the 2.4.x  versions  a  special  module  FvwmTheme  was
       introduced to manage colorsets.  The FvwmTheme functional-
       ity was moved to the core  fvwm,  so  this  module  became
       obsolete.  Some additional information about colorsets may
       be found in the man page of FvwmTheme(1), although  it  is
       obsolete now.

       Old syntax:

         DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme: *
         *FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94
         *FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8

       corresponds to the new syntax:

         CleanupColorsets
         Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94
         Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8

#########################################################
to no avail so far ...

The FVWM-Beta is running very well here (i.e., the errors I got so far
were probably due to my own nonsense and I was able to fix them ..)

Help :) ... and thanks in anticipation

Best Regards
Wolfgang

PS: The RPM's for a Redhat 6.2 are on
http://home.t-online.de/home/520050060325-0001/

They where built on a heavily updated RedHat 6.2 .. you probably
should have at least the latest updates for Redhat 6.2 to install them
... :)

Wolfgang

xv is shareware - I don't think RedHat were really allowed to ship it.

I too use xv heavily, with the PNG patches. It's way lighter and faster
than the gimp (which seems the very epitome of bloatware). Not awfully
scriptable though.

Maybe a better question is: Dominik, what FVWM features consume memory,
and at vaguely what rate? I mean here, statements like "a backdrop

"per menu"/"per use"/"per ...". Little rules of thumb like that, not so
much to locate leaks but to give the byte-thrifty user an idea of how
much penatly they're incurring with their decorations/styles etc.

The second warning should only happen if you switched on the old-style
EWMH support (replaced in 2.5.x). It is disabled by default.

No, sorry, the first FvwmTheme warning is not going to disappear.

fvwm-themes-0.6.0 normally runs without a single warning with both
fvwm-2.4.8 and fvwm-2.5.2, this is the only warning that you get on
the 2.5.x startup. There is nothing you can do about it, except for:

  1) Ignore this warning (preferable)
  2) Don't run alpha/beta fvwm versions
  3) Patch FvwmTheme not to issue this warning
  4) Wait for 0.6.1 where FvwmTheme will be started only with 2.4.x

Mikhael.

Until now we didn't have rpms for 2.5.x.

I don't know which features to include. I want to have new features:

  * bidi (Arabic and Hebrew are broken without this, requires fribidi)
  * png (requires libpng)
  * xinerama (can't easily work on RH 6.x because of too old XFree)
  * xft (can't work on RH 6.x because of too old XFree, I think)
  * xrender (can't work on RH 6.x because of too old XFree, I think)

Probably it is a time to move to RH 7.x rpms for 2.5.x.

I guess there are users that badly need these features and the ones that
don't like to add additional requirements. Too bad.

Regards,
Mikhael.

... As far as I can see:
I *think* I didn't switch anything on or off in this regard during the
FVWM RPM build:  excerpt from the script to build the RPM:

###########################
[ ... ]

tar -xzvf *.tar.gz && \
 cd fvwm-*/ && \
 rm -f config.cache && \
 ./configure && \
 make rpm-dist release=1 && \

[ ... ]

###########################

But I installed IIRC the new beta-FVWM over the old 2.4.-6 (?) FVWM
... I suspect that building/installing the new Beta cleanly with
new-style(?) EWMH support will only be possible after erasing really
*everything* from previous FVWM installs ... which means a lot of
post-install work :/, if I understand correctly :)

Best Regards
Wolfgang

I don't understand this, but if you speak about fvwm, you don't need to
erase anything prior to installing a new version.

And if you speak about fvwm-themes, if you don't enable EWMH support (that
is for the patched 2.4.x) you end up with the good 2.5.x EWMH defaults.
This way EWMH support should work in both fvwm-ewmh-2.4.x and fvwm-2.5.x.

Mikhael.

Roughly,

 - a few hundred bytes per window, per style name and per menu
   style name
 - the size of the strings in menu entries and function actions
 - the size of the pictures and gradients used
   (width x height x depth / 8)
 - about 20 to 50 bytes for each structure that is used (colour
   sets, menus, vectors, bindings, buttonstyles, titlestyles,
   borderstyles, function

The only interesing things to watch are windows, styles that are
issued in the 'wrong' order and growing menus or functions.  The
wrong order of specifying styles is this:

  Style * A, B
  Style X B, C
  Style * A, notB
  Style X B, notC

Fvwm tries to merge new styles together if possible.  In this
case, nothing can be merged because adjacent styles with different
names override style B.  If one had issued

  Style * A, B
  Style * A, notB
  Style X B, C
  Style X B, notC

The list would have been merged to

  Style * A, notB
  Style X B, notC

thus saving half the memory.  This can be a problem if you use
some scripts or complex functions to change fvwm's behaviour or
the used theme at run time.  If done wrong, the stlye list can
grow beyond limits.

Hi,

Could you please provide the snap-shot packages in bzip2-format?
The packer seems to compress this kind of data better than gzip: 

1889552 Jul 24 08:36 fvwm-snap-20020723.tar.gz
1460201 Jul 24 08:36 fvwm-snap-20020723.tar.bz2

-> saved 22%

I think meanwhile most people should have a program which can unpack
*.bz2.
(bzip2 seems to be under GPL so no problems with copyrights)

I tried it by removing the menu style commands and it seemed as if
were gone. So I applied the styles using FvwmConsole but it did not
happen again. After using the dynamic menus for a while say more than
one minute fvwm crashed again.

I used the line 

exec gdb -x ~/gdb_commands /var/tmp/fvwm-test/bin/fvwm >& ~/fvwm_crash.log

in my ~/.xinitrc to obtain a stack trace. Are there any other ways to
debug fvwm?  Maybe one can run fvwm in a virtual X-server. This would
be nice since finding the cause of this crash would not kill all
other x-applications, which is quite annoying.

Any suggestions?

I see it now, you run 0.6.0 not 0.6.1. This explains FvwmNetHints warning.
Also in the rest of my reply I meant fvwm-themes-0.6.1 when said 0.6.0.

I'm almost sure that this problem is related to multiple menu
styles.  It never happened to me while I was using the default
menu style only, but I could provoke a crash twice when I defined
a new menu style for the root menu.

You can run a separate X server or an Xnest in a window.

In case you have XFree, to run a separate X server, issue these
commands from an xterm:

  $ xinit /bin/sleep 100000 -- :1
  (XFree switches to new server)
  (hit ctrl-alt-f7 to return to :0)
  $ fvwm2 -d :1 ...
  (switch to other X server with ctrl-alt-fn)

To run fvwm in an Xnest window (Xnest should run on any X server):

  $ Xnest -full -sync -name "Xnest :3" -fp `xset -q | grep fonts` :3            
  $ fvwm2 -d :3 ...

Both ways have their disadvantages.  With a separate X server,
XFree frequently hangs when switching displays, especially if the
pointer/keyboard/server is grabbed.  Xnest does not handle all
types of events well.  It's especially annoying that you can't
easily leave the Xnest window without moving the pointer across
it.  You could use the WarpPointer command for that.  Also, key
bindings don't work in an Xnest window if they are already handled
by the parent fvwm.  Furthermore it is sometimes difficult to
attach a debugger to an fvwm running under Xnest.

However, the biggest problem at hand is to reproduce the problem
at will.  As long as it happens at a random time in a function
that just accesses memory that was corrupted somewhere else, the
core dumps are not very helpful.

Maybe someone can run Purify or insure++ once we find a fairly
reliable way to trigger the memory corruption.

I want a function that will "windowshade rollup and lower window" or 
"windowshade unroll and raise window". The following:

Mouse 0 T N MoveOrRaiseOrShade
AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseOrShade
+ C Raise
+ M Move
+ D Current (Shaded) ShadeAndRaise
+ D Current (!Shaded) ShadeAndAway

has a cute bug: if a window is shaded, both last lines are executed.

So I was wondering, is there an Abort function so that I can write

AddToFunc ShadeAndRaise
+ I WindowShade
+ I Raise
+ I Abort

Other solutions welcome too.

You want an if-else syntax instead.

In 2.5.1+ do this:

  + D ThisWindow (Shaded) ShadeAndRaise
  + D Cond (NoMatch) ShadeAndAway

There is a new command Break that finishes the function, but only the
current one, not the parent. You don't really need Abort for this task.

The way it works, you may even do this using 1 function, not 3:

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseOrShade
  + C Raise
  + M Move
  + D ThisWindow (Shaded) Raise
  + D WindowShade
  + D Cond (NoMatch) Lower

1)  How can I bind a keystroke to act as though I'd just clicked on the
Start button? (Meta_L comes to mind...)

2)  Is it still possible to have a quick-launch button on the TaskBar?

Thanks in advance!

Something like (press left windows key):

  Key Super_L  A  A  Menu StartMenu Root 0 o100-25p

> 2)  Is it still possible to have a quick-launch button on the TaskBar?

No, FvwmTaskBar has 3 fixed parts: start menu, window list and clock+mail.
FvwmButtons has no such limitation.

Just let me add that the syntax of conditional commands will
probably change before 2.6 is released.

Hello all,


I am desperately looking for some way to make my fvwm desktop look as much
like Sun's OpenLook / ol(v)wm as possible, so as to ease long-time openlook
users moving to a new desktop. I was wondering whether anyone has done an
openlook theme in the past or if there's any floating around. If I have to
do it myself (by taking lots of screenshots), I would really appreciate some
pointers on how to quickly get at least the window borders and menu to look
somewhat like openlook.

I hope this is not too strange of a query...

Thanks a lot for your time,

-Philipp

When using the Menu and Popup commands it's possible to specify a position
for the menu.
I was wondering if its possible to get an alternative position if the
first one isn't possible.
For exaplle , I have a menu for icons that normally pops up above the
icon, this is good, because normally my icons reside at the bottom of the
scrren. But sxometimes I put icons at the top (for various reasons). In
this case there is no room for the menu all above the icon, so the menu
pops up over the icon (as far up as possible). What I would like in this
case is to have a "fall back" so in case the intended position doesn't
"work" I coud get a menu to display below the icon.
Is this possible?

Sorry to disappoint you here.

Currently it is impossible to emulate window borders. The best that you
may do is a flat black border without corners, or mwm-like borders.

Border handles may only have the size of the title height, but not half of
the title height. The same about title buttons positions, they can't have
an offset that is half of the title height.

An oval around menu items can't be emulated.
Menus can be "pinned" in 2.5.x, but a pin button is impossible.

A flat box around icon windows (bigger than icons) is impossible.

Mikhael.

There aren't many openlook screenshots floating around, but I found:

http://www.plig.org/xwinman/screenshots/olvwm-matt.gif

http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/teach/inpunix/06olvwm.gif

http://themes.freshmeat.net/screenshots/23325/ - this is actually a kde
theme, but looks a lot like openlook


There's more (but they don't have the default color scheme) at
http://www.plig.org/xwinman/olvwm.html

Hope that helps!

Cheers,

-Philipp

You can write a shell script and use it with PipeRead:

  Mouse 1 I N PipeRead "my_iconmenu.sh WindowMenu $[i.x] $[i.y] $[i.width] $[i.height]"

--------------------------- my_iconmenu.sh -----------------------
if [[ $3 -lt 500 ]]; then
  echo Menu $1 rectangle "$4"x"$5"+"$2"+"$3" c +100
else
  echo Menu $1 rectangle "$4"x"$5"+"$2"+"$3" c -100m
fi
------------------------------------------------------------------

You may wonder why the "icon" context rectangle doesn't work.  I'm
not sure yet, but it looks like a bug.

Hmm, I actually use the icon cntext, like: icon 0 -100 (I'm not sure
exactly, as I'm visiting my parents and am forced to use Windows *shudder*
and a 56 kbit modem (so therefore there is some spelling errors, because
it lags so much in pine :-()

And as far as I can tell the icon contex works as I expect it (maybe
luck...)

"Context" context works directly, but not using PipeRead or SendToModule.
It is fixed by Dominik as I write this message.

You may rewrite this without additional files (start FvwmPerl somewhere):

Mouse 1 I A SendToModule FvwmPerl eval command( \
        "Menu WindowMenu rectangle $[i.width]x$[i.height]+$[i.x]x+$[i.y] c " \
        . ($[i.y] > 500? "-100m-4p": "+100+4p")

One problem with SendToModule (but not with PipeRead) is that the menu
commands are invoked without any window context. Currently it is possible
to write "WindowId $w" before "Menu" to work around it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This depended on the icon layout:

  Only a pixmap: worked fine
  Pixmap+Title:  only pixmap was taken into account
  Only title:    the pointer position was used instead

With the fix, the whole icon geometry is taken into account.

Or with the now fixed code in the 2.5 branch:

  Mouse 1 I N PipeRead "my_iconmenu.sh WindowMenu $[i.y] $[vp.height]"

--------------------------- my_iconmenu.sh -----------------------
#!/bin/sh

if [ $[$2 + $2] -lt $3 ]; then
  echo Menu $1 icon c +100
else
  echo Menu $1 icon c -100m
fi

Does anyone use other compilers than gcc to compile fvwm?  Sun Forte C
fails with two fatal errors and gives lot of warnings.

First one is use of __attribute__ so I stole old #define
__attribute__(x) from 2.4.8 sources.  Second problem is char
*gbk_0[0]= {"GBK", NULL}; in libs/FlocaleCharset.c

    ...  Thanks a lot, Mikhael: Perhaps I should get myself better
glasses :)

At any rate: after having installed now fvwm-themes-base-0.6.1-1 and a
fresh rebuilt of FVWM 2.5.2 the only error message that I can see now
at fvwm start-time is this line on the console from where I start
fvwm-themes:

FvwmTheme is obsolete, see the Colorset section of the fvwm(1) man
page

Depending on the FVWM configuration trials here I sometimes get other
error messages (including the "old" one concerning "FvwmNetHints"),
but I think (not being sure of it, still trying) these errors come
only if i make FVWM read the old (??) config files (i.e. those from
previously installed FVWM versions) in
.fvwm/themes/personal
instead of those in
/usr/share/fvwm/themes/*

After having installed fvwm-themes-base-0.6.1-1, I rebuilt the current
stable and unstable FVWM versions: I did this cos I didn't know
exactly what impact the current fvwm-themes-base version here on my
machine has on a FVWM RPM build process on the same machine. Results
(for a RedHat 6.2) are here:

Enjoy! :)

I never attack, but I often suggest what works for me.

I mean, a lot of information that someone needs is already on the
internet, but sometimes you should find good search keywords.

Right. Off-list you mentioned that you often don't put smilies, even
when you mean them. I suggest you start putting in more smilies; without
them you appear hostile and offensive, to me at least.  I get the
impression that you don't think very highly of me, but that doesn't
bother me, because you wouldn't be the first.

But, whatever. Do your own thing, guy. It's gotten you this far! ;)

Anyway, I'm going for some breakfast. I've been on the computer for a
good 14 hours straight, I need to get off for a bit.

True; and google is a wonderful tool (I use it often, as it were).

Please report all possible problems on fvwm-themes mailing lists.
Generally, you should "Restart fvwm-themes-start" after upgrading.

fvwm is not affected by fvwm-themes at all, so rebuilding was not needed.

I will add these rpms later. When you build rpms for RH 7.x please install
fribidi and fribidi-devel from Mandrake first.

Mikhael.

Hi,

     Even though I'm on the same floor as Sun's compiler group I still
used gcc to compile fvwm. Our compiler group has tried to be compatible
with gcc in later releases (even to the extent of ignoring obvious
errors like the one below :-) so they will probably want to take a
look at this. I've forwarded your email to them and I'll let you know
what they say.

Hi,
I don't believe it:
To change my icons for iconified windows I edited
.fvwm/themes-rc-3 to this value:
Read "/home/user/.fvwm/themes/personal/settings/iconstyles/native"

I changed .fvwm/themes-rc-2 resp.
.fvwm/themes/current-test/themes-rc-2 to that value:
Read "/home/user/.fvwm/themes/personal/settings/iconstyles/native"

I click on
Theme Management > Refresh and Reload > Refresh with no cache
and the changes from above have been destroyed, reset to the values
the files from above had before.

So how can I change these icons?
Is there a menu point or file that I didn't see?

Running FVWM  2.5.2 and FVWM Themes 0.6.1 on a Redhat 6.2, and I start
FVWM with a
exec /usr/bin/fvwm-themes-start

Help :)
Thanks in anticipation

Regards
Wolfgang

We use Sun Forte C.  2.4.7 was the last version I compiled.  acc seemed
to struggle with glib's inline, but I could get through the compile by
setting:

CC="acc -DG_INLINE_FUNC=extern"

before running "configure."  Hope this helps.

Hi Mikhael

No problem, but how do you know in advance that a difficulty with FVWM
is one that is related strictly to either FVWM or FVWM-themes: I
think, this (FVWM-related or not) is a question that even the FVWM or
FVWM-themes coders cannot answer easily at times.
At least I am definitely not in the position to decide such a question
without errors.

The only possible solution I see for that, is that as soon as I have
fvwm-themes installed I'm on the wrong mailing list here and move to
a FVWM-themes list.
But how long will it take, until the folks on the FVWM-themes list
will tell me to ask the FVWM list?

Kafka, (at least I *think* it was him), I hear you knocking ... :)

Best Regards
Wolfgang

But acc isn't part of Sun Forte C so its not clear from the above
that you WERE using Sun's compiler. What is acc?

Problems of _building_ the official rpms are better not to be discussed on
any lists, but with me privately. Thank you.

The rule in fvwm-themes is you don't edit any existing files, especially
autogenerated ones. You may create and edit your own personal parts that
will be detected by issuing "reset" from the menus. Or in some cases
optionally use GUIs if exist to create such personal parts.

Please create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/iconstyles-extra file and put any
Icon and MiniIcon lines that you want to define. Then do the usual
"Refresh with no cache" and choose this newly appeared iconstyles-extra
component from the Themes menu or Themes Center GUI.

Mikhael.

I want to center windows (of various size) in a page.
Isn't there a command to calculate window size and screen
size in order to position it at center and middle?

I would search in mail archive if there was a search engine 
in fvwm.org....

Here is a function for this usage: Next (MyWindow) CenterWindow

  DestroyFunc CenterWindow
  AddToFunc   CenterWindow
  + I ThisWindow Piperead "echo Move \
    $(( $[vp.width]/2-$[w.width]/2 ))p \
    $(( $[vp.height]/2-$[w.height]/2 ))p"

ThisWindow may be removed, it is only needed to avoid errors when
CenterWindow is called without a window context.

Yes, this request about centering a window was answered several times...

Hello,

I am using fvwm 2.2.5 on OpenBSD 3.1/sparc64, I can upgrade this
system but I would love to have my config working with 2.2.5 as I
have other systems that won`t be upgraded.

When I use the KeyI function to iconize my windows three out of
four times my keybindings stop working until hit mouse key 1.

Am I doing something universally stupid or is this a known
problem that one can`t fix.

(Full config at http://www.isk.kth.se/~janj/fvwm2rc.m4).

Well, Iconify in this binding only works if there is the focussed window.
If there is no such window, you are prompted to select one.

Try this one to avoid prompting:

  Key I   A   SC  Current KeyI

I don't think you may iconify a window that has a pointer if it is not
focused in 2.2.5, PointerKey was introduced in 2.3.12 only.

Does this info help?

Mikhael.

Sorry. I was not clear enough. It is after I iconify the last
window that my key bindings stop working.

To follow up on my own post.

I have now tried the following.
fvwm 2.4.6 on Solaris 8 / sparc. Ok.
fvwm 2.2.5 on OpenBSD 3.1 / i386. Not ok.
fvwm 2.4.5 on OpenBSD 3.1 / i386. Ok.

This make me beleive that it is a bug in the 2.2.5 version of
fvwm.

I will keep my fvwmrc 2.2.5 compatible and upgrade where
possible.

Sorry for wasting your time.

Hello,

Often I find it convenient to open four xterms and start doing work with
them, so I have this menu item on one of my menus:

+ "4 XTerms" Exec exec xterm & xterm & xterm & xterm

But, unfortunately, they do not cover the entire screen, so I have to
'Maximize grow grow' them all as soon as they open. Since this is always
the first thing I do with them, and I've never done anything else, I
figured I might as well get fvwm to grow them for me. Would it be
possible to do this, without affecting the behavior of the other xterms
that I open individually?

Thanks in advance.

Try this:


  addtofunc XtermCreateGrow
  + i exec exec xterm
  + i wait xterm
  + i next (xterm) maximize grow grow

  addtofunc Create4XTerms
  + I XtermCreateGrow
  + I XtermCreateGrow
  + I XtermCreateGrow
  + I XtermCreateGrow

  AddToMenu foobar
  + "4 XTerms" Create4XTerms

However, it's really better to provide the xterms with the proper
geometry manually.  The "Next" command can not guarantee that the
command is applied to the correct window.

Bye

Hi,

I've switched from fvwm 2.4.8 to 2.5.2 without any modifications on my
fvwmrc-files. Xmms no doesn't hide anymore, so I'm happy.

But there's one point I'd like to have in 2.4.8 style: I have some
wmaker and gnome dockable app's in FvwmButton (wmbiff,gabber,..). 
In version 2.4.8 'Action(Mouse 1)' was only executed when pressing the
buttons border, 2.5.2 excutes it for the whole button. Am I right?

Is there a way to have v2.5.2 configured to behave like v2.4.8?
In the meantime I have changed all 'Mouse 1' to 'Mouse 2', but now it's
not like a real wmaker applet.


Regards,
Erwin

Yes, the default behaviour of Swallow plus Action was changed.

Add ActionIgnoresClientWindow somewhere here (for example, after Size)
to get the 2.4.x behaviour.

Shame on me! I've stopped reading the man-page just one paragraph before
that option is described.

Didn't work; the end result is that one already opened xterm grew,
another opened and grew, a second opened and did nothing, and then a
third and fourth opened which both grew.

Aside from the fact that it's growing the wrong ones, it's also growing
them before the others open which results in one fully maximized behind
some others grown into odd shapes.

Aw, but manually is too hard! That means I'd have to hardcode the size,
which would be a PITA if I ever change X resolutions.

Thanks anyway, I guess I'll go back to clicking.

Argh! I had this working, then I changed something, changed it back, and
now it won't work! *sigh*

I'll wrestle with it some more, I guess.

Well, it's not clear what you expect of growing.  It works like
this:  it takes a window and extends its four borders until it
hits the border of a different window from the outside.  As you
can imagine, that algorithm doesn't work well with overlapping
windows.  Usually it doesn't make sense at all to maximize more
than one window on a single page, and it gets worse with "grow".

Actually, why do you think you need "grow"?  What is the layout of
your desktop before the xterms are created and how would you like
it with them?  Please draw ASCII graohics to illustrate your
needs.

I can't speak for you, but the only time I change the resolution
is when I get a new machine.  However, it *is* possible to write
these lines in a way that takes care of the display resolution by
invoking a shell script via PipeRead.  I can write one that
satisfies your need once I understand what you want to do.

Try the colorset options and define the appropriate colour sets
with FvwmTheme.  I'm not sure if pixmaps in the buttons are
implemented, but it's worth a try:

  *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg red, bg green
  *FvwmThemeColorset 6 fg blue, bg yellow, pixmap ...
  # run FvwmTheme before anything else is done
  ModuleSynchronous Timeout 5 FvwmTheme

  *FvwmIconMan*Colorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*FocusColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan*FocusAndSelectColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan*PlainColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*SelectColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*TitleColorset 6

See "man FvwmTheme" for details.

Note:  In the 2.5.x versions, FvwmTheme is obsolete.  Just replace
"*FvwmThemeColorset ..." with "Colorset ..." and remove the line
starting the module.

Yes, it is necessary to distinguish them, because Rob wants to grow xterms
in the certain order if I understand.  -n is stronger, -name is even more.

When Wait above is passed it is not guaranteed that 4 xterms are already
up, it is only guaranteed that only one xterm4 is up. And if you group all
four Wait together it may hang from time to time. This works (note -g):

  DestroyFunc Xterm4CreateGrow
  AddToFunc   Xterm4CreateGrow
  + I Exec exec xterm -n xterm1 -g +0+0
  + I Wait xterm1
  + I Exec exec xterm -n xterm2 -g -0+0
  + I Wait xterm2
  + I Exec exec xterm -n xterm3 -g +0-0
  + I Wait xterm3
  + I Exec exec xterm -n xterm4 -g -0-0
  + I Wait xterm4
  + I Next (xterm1) Maximize grow grow
  + I Next (xterm2) Maximize grow grow

  + I Next (xterm4) Maximize grow grow

You didn't say what is "the rest of your desktop theme", but FvwmIconMan
supports 2 more button border styles than the 3 you listed: raisededge
and sunkedge, both are quite interesting.

You may use flat borders and colorset Pixmap, but this probably will not
do what you want, since you want to provide your own borders.

Currently all FvwmIconMan *colorset options do not control the background
of a single button, but of the whole manager window. The colorset image is
resized to the initial size of FvwmIconMan (and is not changed when you
resize FvwmIconMan), if you use flat borders all buttons behave like
holes that bare parts of the whole images (one for each button class).

Or, since the vertical button size in FvwmIconMan is not changed unlike
the horizontal size, you may use TiledPixmap in the colorset to define
horizontal borders if you can live without vertical borders.

I think you can't switch them off currently. The only alternative is to
define MiniIcon for a represented window.

I expect it to utilize as much screen space as possible without
overlapping. The problem here is that the windows are being grown too
soon; they need to wait for the other windows to be open before they are
grown.

> Usually it doesn't make sense at all to maximize more
> than one window on a single page, and it gets worse with "grow".

I totally disagree with this statement. I have here a situation in which
it makes perfect sense to grow four windows (though, in reality, the
top-left one stays the same size). I've yet to see a situation in which
fully maximizing more than one window makes any sense ;)

> Actually, why do you think you need "grow"?

Because then I don't have to bother figuring out how big they ought to
be, and I can use one command to size any window perfectly, and they
don't overlap. It's all about flexibility and convenience.

> What is the layout of your desktop before the xterms are created and
> how would you like it with them?  Please draw ASCII graohics to
> illustrate your needs.

I think I need grow, because I have wasted screen space that I want to
be used by xterms. Here is what my desktop looks like before growing:

+------------------------+
|xterm    |xterm    |    |
|         |         |    |
|         |         |    |
+---------+---------+    |
|xterm    |xterm    |    |
|         |         |    |
|         |         |    |
+---------+---------+    |
|                        |
|     root               |
|                        |
+------------------------+

And I want it to look like this:

+------------------------+
|xterm    |xterm         |
|         |              |
|         |              |
+---------+--------------+
|xterm    |xterm         |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |
+---------+--------------+

Understand now? The original problem was that it was growing them in the
wrong order and the wrong time, and the result was oddly grown windows,
not in the way that I wanted them. Manually growing each one after it's
open does exactly what I want, I was just looking for a way to automate
it.

Yes exactly, I'm getting a new machine soon, and I'd rather not have to
re-figure out what size the xterms need to be when "Maximize grow grow"
is right there for me to use.

I just want to eliminate wasted screen space, so I can see as little of
the root window as possible, with four xterms that are as large as
possible without overlapping.

I just compiled and installed fvwm2 version 2.4.8 on a Solaris machine
running with openwin/cde.  It basically works, but whenever I move a
window, the window border and the sizing hashmarks inside the window
leave black lines behind that litter up the display until I explicity
tell fvwm2 to refresh.  This happens even with a blank .fvwm2rc, so it's
not a local configuration issue.  Any idea what I can do?  My
configuration is below.  I'm not using many of the extensions, but it
didn't look to me like any of those extensions would help.
	Thanks,
	Jeff

Ok, you've almost got it! ;)

This works, except that the second (or later) time I run it, whichever
xterm had the mousecursor over it doesn't get grown, and an xterm with
the same name on another desk gets ungrown. The ungrown thing could be
avoided with "Maximize true grow grow", but it doesn't change the fact
that the current window is not grown. Mostly this just leads to odd
results like this:

+---------+--------------+
|xterm    |xterm         |
|         |              |
|         |              |
+---------+              |
|xterm    |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         +--------------+
|         |xterm         |
|         |              |
|         |              |
+---------+--------------+

But it's still maximum utilized screen space, so I'm not really
complaining ;)

Thanks.

What about using FvwmRearrange module ?

Try this:
AddToFunc Create4XTerms
+ "I" All Iconify on
+ "I" Exec exec xterm -g +0+0
+ "I" wait xterm
+ "I" Exec exec xterm -g -0+0
+ "I" wait xterm
+ "I" Exec exec xterm -g +0-0
+ "I" wait xterm
+ "I" Exec exec xterm -g -0-0
+ "I" wait xterm
+ "I" Module FvwmRearrange -tile -v -m -mn 2 0 0 100 100

Pitfalls:
 -> it needs to iconify all windows present on the current desk for the
vertical FvwmRearrange to work
 -> you may look more into FvwmRearrange parameters to improve the code
 -> you may want to add names to your terminals ( i usually do not )

Hope this is finally what you looked for. Thanks for this idea anyway.
It's now part of my .fvwm2rc ! ;)

Rgds,
Christian

The function relies on unique window names.  If you run it a second
time before all those windows were closed, it fails.  Try

  + I (xterm1, CurrentDesk, CurrentPage) Maximize grow grow

Or give the xterms unique names:

  + I Exec exec xterm -n "xterm_+$[vp.x]+$[vp.y]@$d" -g +0+0
  ...
  + I (xterm_+$[vp.x]+$[vp.y]@$d) Maximize grow grow
  ...

Please try out 2.5.2.  I'm not recommending to use it but merely
try if the problem is still there.  Second, can you make a
screen shot showing the problem and post it?  Please don't post
your whole desktop, a small portion is enough.  Finally, please
apply the attached patch to the sources, recompile and reinstall
fvwm and post the output it produces (just the last twenty lines).

To apply the patch, cd into the directory with the move_resize.c
file in the fvwm source tree, copy the patch file there and issue
the command

  $ patch < moveoutline.patch

It's not a matter of configuration.

In fvwm-themes you may create a screenshot of a specific window or the
whole desktop automatically using the "Window Utility" menu.

You may do this manually of cause too. Use xv for this, pretty convenient.
Or import utility from ImageMagick:

  % import -frame /tmp/shot-window.png            # one window
  % import -window root /tmp/shot-window.png      # desktop

Mikhael.

There are also gimp, xwd and more utilities to create screenshots.

Jeff,

     The version of fvwm shouldn't make any difference (I've run several
and am now using 2.5.2 on Solaris 8). What is important is the version
of Solaris and patches you have installed (especially your X11/openwin
patches). I don't know what patches you need but Sun's web site does
have a tool for searching for and downloading free patches. I'd go
there and look for X11/OpenWin patches. My guess is that this will take
care of your problem. If your lab has a Sun support contract you might
have your system administrator talk to the Sun support people.

Gordon

Hi, all!
I has downloaded the fvwm2 (fvwm-2.4.8.tar.gz), installed it, and I'm in
progress of testing it out. I have found a couple of sample .fvwm2rc
files, and have tested each one in turn, by copying them to ~/.fvwm2rc
.  system.fvwm2rc-sample-95, is coming up with an uniform gray screen,
I'd have examined the error messages (TTE0) and it seems like a number
of icons are missing, "mini.window.xpm" for instance. No one *.xpm files
are present in the package, and those wanted by sample-95 file is
neither found on the hard disk. Is those samples intended to be
runnable? If so, where are the files? 

I'd tried to follow the instructions in the sample-96 file, to start
fvwm2 whith no .fvwm2rc file, and run "config 95" in the main menu. This
script do not do anything. It may be that the script files are placed
differently than expected by fvwm2, but how to point to the proper place
without fvwm2rc ?

I'd will be very grateful for any help.

I'd vould like to have an -95 look on my desktop, as I'm used to use it.
Now I'm upgrading (from 2.0.4) in hope to work around an problem of has
to use icon line to change focus ( sloppy turned off). I'm planning to
find a 95 looking sample and thereafter modyfy it, put in menu items for
programs I'd have etc. etc. Have tried the old rc, the result looked to
me as format of .fvwm2rc are quite different from .fvwm95rc, it has to
be reworked from scratch.

You can download them from the Home Page www.fvwm.org.
Untar them to any directory where you have a write access.

I suppose you did "make install" properly, so modules and data can be
found by the executable.

Remove ~/.fvwm directory (and ~/.fvwm2rc too if you have it) and choose
"Setup 95 Script" from the root menu again. What do you get? Any errors?
If you get a setup dialog, specify your icon path on the first step.

You may also try fvwm-themes, it installs all data used, maybe it will
save you a time of emulating what you want. But then, please read its FAQ.
