It is enough that you don't want to go there.

After a little manpage reading and trying things out (they don't quite do
what I expected from the man page) I got this:

*FvwmButtons3 KillModMe xterm.xpm KillModule FvwmButtons3
*FvwmButtons3 KillMe xterm.xpm Close
*FvwmButtons3 (Title Kill, Icon term.xpm, Action (Mouse 3) Close)

which is manifested by the command
FvwmButtons FvwmButtons3

I expected the first button to do a FvwmButtons3 kill.  However, it does
not.  This is presumably because fvwm2 knows the FvwmButtons instance with
FvwmButtons3 definitions by some name other than FvwmButtons3.  Invoking a
KillModule FvwmButtons
through FvwmTalk, both my initial FvwmButtons and the FvwmButtons with the
"3" definitions were swept away.  This is probably a bug/feature in either
fvwm2 or in FvwmButtons -- probably fvwm2.

The second button invokes the Close mechanism and gives me the little
skull_and_crossbones emblem.  A second click without moving the mouse
kills the associated button bar.

The third button gives me a curious response.  Clicking with Mouse 3 gives
me the skull_and_crossbones.  However, mysteriously, clicking with mouse 1
gives me in instant deletion of the window.  This is the magical
wished-for response from the initial poster.

The fvwm2 manpage doesn't say Close or Delete takes an optional argument
($0 would be nice in this case), and indeed it is correct (:^).  Maybe it
should.  In any case, I see the commonly used (motif-ish) double-click
option for window-bound menus making an implicit assumption that Delete is
to be applied to the current window.  I don't know why I get the
inconsistent behavior.  It might be clearly apparent from the source, but
I haven't looked.

Hello,

I have been experiencing the following problem with the FvwmPager module that
came with the latest version of Fvwm (2.0.36), which I got with my Red Hat
Linux 5.0 system.

In my .fvwm2rc configuration file I have the lines:

DesktopSize 2x4
Module FvwmPager 0 1
*FvwmPagerGeometry 105x80+0+0

Here is the problem:

The viewport does not appear to be the right size on the pager as it is
*smaller* than some (or sometimes all) of the squares on the pager which 
are defined by the grid.

According to the man pages, the viewport is supposed to be the size of a 
page (ie. the size of a rectangle on the FvwmPager grid)

In the grid rectangles where this problem occurs, the FvwmPager viewport is
short of an FvwmPager page by a row of pixels by a column of pixels.

Sometimes this problem goes away after I restart Fvwm.
Invoking *FvwmPagerGeometry with many other geometries gives similar results.

I like to specify both coordinates in the *FvwmPagerGeometry command because
I want the FvwmPager to occupy a very particular spot of my desktop.

Thanks for your attention,

I hope this bug gets fixed in the next release of fvwm2/FvwmPager.

Hello..

Are there any patches out there to change the behavior of EdgeScroll and
the root menus in 2.0.46?  If not, which files should I modify?  (I'm
using fvwm-2.0.46-smr)

I want to change EdgeScroll to only scroll when the mouse is dragging a
window, or when a hotkey is pressed..  No scrolling just by touching the
screen edge..  (but the "magnetic screen edges" produced by
EdgeResistance is very nice :)

The other change I'm looking for has to do with clicking at the screen
edges.  For me, this always brings up a root-window menu, regardless of
what window the mouse is really in.  This is annoying, because it
prevents me from resizing maximized windows..

Thanks.  :)

Using fvwm2.0.46

Is there any way I can get a larger resize area around window borders? Let
me explain:

I have FvwmAuto and FocusAutoRaise set. SO when my mouse moves into another
window, it is raised and given focus.

If 2 windows overlap and I want to resize the top window, I move my mouse
to any of the window borders and wait for the cursor to change to the
'resize' cursor. There is a _very_ narrow margin where the cursor does
this. Too far and it becomes the root cursor, too little and it stays at
the window cursor!

I kinda like the Windows approach where it becomes a double headed arrow so
that I have plenty of margin.

Am I making any sense?

Thanks,
Vikas

I complained about this also. It is definitely very annoying. It is like
the mouse button clicks always "see" the root window at the edges, even
if another window is overlapping it. (i.e., if a window frame as at the
bottom edge, you cannot grab the bottom edge and resize the window.)

What I did to fix it was to change this line in fvwm.h:

#define PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS 0

It may or may not do what you want...

Look in the manual for the BorderWidth style attribute.  Make it bigger.

Not exactly. I changed this to 100! and didnt see any perceptible
difference.  So this must not be what I am looking for. I am talking about
plain old xterm, which has its own title-bar, border, etc. 

Say I want to resize it by dragging any one of its 4 sides. I want a larger
margin of "dragging" area. Right now, I have to precisely position the
mouse to get the special resize cursor so that I can start dragging.

Thanks,

You need to look at the HandleWidth attributes for handled windows.
BorderWidth is for windows that just have borders and no handles. :-)

Oh, right.  HandleWidth.  Yeah, that's the ticket.

Well, anyway, one of those widths will do what you want, Vikas... keep
trying!

Not really. HandleWidth 10 does indeed give me a chunky border around the
window but the problem remains. the cursor changes to the resize cursor
only in the last couple of pixels (and the chunky border looks ugly to
boot!) 

BTW, isnt there a double-headed arrow cursor like in Windows that I can use
during resizing? 

Also, I cant seem to shrink a window without first expanding it by atleast
a pixel! I guess thats why the resize cursor points outwards, eh? Seems
like a silly limitation.

Thanks!  That fixed my root-menu-at-screen-edges problem, and I managed
fix the mouse-paging problem, too.  If you comment out one of the
HandlePaging()'s in events.c, the mouse will scroll the screen only when
dragging a window.  However, this seems to generate some trivial fvwm
internal errors; so it's not a good solution for non-private use.

Doesn't work that way for me, I'm using fvwm2.0.46 as downloaded from
the fvwm site.

You can use any X cursor for any context  controlled by fvwm2, see the
fvwm2 man page, "CursorStyle".

Doesn't  work that way for  me.   In my case, I  have  resize bound to
button 1 on the handles.  As I enter a handle, from any direction, the
pointer (cursor) changes to a right angle with  an arrow pointing into
it.  This resize pointer  stays this way  as I move the pointer around
within the handle.  The wider I make the handle, the  more room I have
to  move around.  As  soon  as I depress the  button,  a 1  pixel wide
resize  frame appears around   the window.  As  I  move the mouse, the
resize frame smoothly follows the pointer in any direction I move it.

An  execption is  rxvt, and  I assume xterm,  which   resize in little
jumps.  This comes from these applications only  wanting to be resized
to certain sizes.  (Multiples of the character size.)

This is a work-around rather than a solution, but for what it's worth, you
might try putting something like

Mouse 2         W       CM       Resize

in your .fvwmrc. This line lets you resize a window by starting a
click-and-drag from _anywhere inside a window_, dragging until you hit a
margin and then resizing it. (As it is set above, one must use the second
mouse button while holding down both the  control and meta key). This
works on maximized windows as well.

Hope this helps.
Alan

Nope, that's not at all how it works for me.  As soon as my cursor

Again, this doesn't happen to me.  I can shrink/expand at will, without
first moving the opposite direction.

fvwm 2.0.46 on an ultra 5 running Solaris 2.5.1

When I log in, running fvwm as my CDE wm, it starts up fvwmpager and
fvwmbuttons, then
waits 10 minutes (I've timed it) before starting my home session.  During
that time, fvwm is
sitting there with an hourglass cursor and is unresponsive.

I'm sure it's my fault, but I can't imagine what the problem is.  I'm using
the same fvwm2rc
I used at my previous job, and my home session consists of 5 xterms.

Also, is there a way to get apps in the home session to start on a
specified workspace?

I've been using fvwm2 for 2 days now, and I must say, I'm much more
impressed than I was with my LAST wm! 

Take a look at this:

  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/graphics/netscape-fvwm2.gif

So, the Netscape icon's been funky for me in my last wm as well, but
just the random noise part.  In fvwm2, the mask's total size is also
being inflated to about 128x128 as can be seen from the icon's large
offset. 

This is Communicator 4.5b1, but the NS icon has done similar things
since 4.0.

No doubt NS is at fault here, but are there any work arounds that fvwm2
(or I) could do for this, at least to get it back down to 48x48?

Thanx,
~p@

Try specifying option -xrm "*Desk: 4" or set fvwm style StartsOnDesk.

Thanks for your help, but that did not change the timeout.  I even tried
changing the "1" to
larger and smaller (well, 0) numbers, to no avail.

Regarding the window starts on workspace question, doesn't StartsOnDesk
start the app on a different desktop?  I'm trying to start it on the same
desktop but in a different workspace (or perhaps I'm using desktop and
workspace wrong - a workspace is a box in the pager - can you display all
the desktops in the pager and page through them instead)?

Hello,

I have bound the FvwmAuto autoraise module to all window's titlebar button #2 
mouse button #2, and I think it's handy because I use the module quite often.

Since I am equally likely to use the module as to get fed up of it while running
fvwm2, I also bound a function that kills the module to button #2 mouse 
button #3, but to save buttons I would like button #2, mouse button #2 to
activate the module if it is not running and deactivate it if it is running.

This I think requires some sort of conditional structure in defining an Fvwm
function which I don't think is present in Fvwm right now.
So, could this functionality perhaps be added in the future?

I know I can have up to 10 buttons but I really don't like a cluttered titlebar.

After all, a window manager is all about look and feel isn't it?

----

Now, another thing, when I click on the button to activate the module the button

does not seem to go down for 1/6 of a second or anything which looks bad cause

it looks as if one never clicked on anything while in fact an action was 

invoked.

----

Also, the conditional statement functionality mentioned above should also prevent

me from activating multiple FvwmAuto modules (why would one need more than one

running? We need to include this because each module started needs to be killed 

separately, which can be tedious in this case, other than the fact that the 

modules would be taking up space for nothing.)


Best regards,

Neil

Hello,

Is everyone familiar with the AfterStep application that one activates by

clicking on a window's titlebar and the whole window disappears leaving the 

titlebar there. I am not a fan of that utility, but it has inspired me to

think about something similar:

A click of a titlebar (this would have to be done through a binding of course)

causes the titlebar to stay in the same place but causes the window to disappear

and reappear in an upright position above the titlebar.

Advantages over the AfterStep utility: it is a quick way of seeing what is under 
the screen and getting a window out of the way, but you can still see the 

window's contents. On the other hand in AfterStep you cannot know which of

6 toolbars all labelled "xterm" is which and I find that a little annoying, and

I find that the AfterStep application is there not so much for the feel but for

the look.

Another advantage of my scheme is that you can work with windows with

the titlebar on the bottom, and I would just love it... you could also

have two windows occupy the (almost) exact same spot, onw with titlebar above

and one with titlebar below. Moving the mouse and using the autoraise modules

allows you to swap windows while leaving both titlebars visible.

|---------------------------------------------------|
| titlebar 1                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| overlapping windows 1 and 2 ...                   |
|                                                   |
|   switch back and forth by moving the pointer     |
|   to each (this only works with FvwmAuto)         |

        Ok, first the terminology. Fvwm uses the terms desktop (same as the
X property) and page or viewport (a screen-sized subdivision of the virtual
desktop). If you specify DeskTopSize 3x3, you have a virtual desktop of 9
pages arranged in a 3x3 grid. What many window managers refer to as
workspaces are functionally equivalent to Fvwm's desktops.

        There is a fixed number of pages per desktop (set by DeskTopSize -
though you *can* reconfigure that while running). There is no fixed number
of desktops. You can arbitrarily assign an app to desk 38 if you like, 
though it would probably be a bit silly. The pager *displays* a fixed number
of desktops depending on the arguments with which it was started, and the
*FvwmPager section of your fvwm2rc allows you to assign titles to the 
desktops, that the pager will display.

        I normally start the pager with 

                "I"  Module FvwmPager 0 4

which has the pager display all 5 of my 4x4 desktops. If I said instead

                "I"  Module FvemPager 0 1 

it would display only the first two desktops. When the pager is iconified,
the icon displays an image of the current desktop.


        Now, as to starting an app on a particular page, there are two
options. One is to start the app with very large x,y coordinates to try
to position the windows on the page where you want them. The disadvantage
is that you must always start the app from a particular page, since the
geometry offsets are always calculated relative to where you are at the
moment. (Also, obviously, the app must understand *and* correctly handle
a standard geometry argument. Some don't.) 

        The second option is to apply my StartsOnPage patch, available at

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html

The patch is written against version 2.0.46. Basically, it adds a new
command, StartsOnPage, which can be used as a replacement for StartsOnDesk.
With a single argument, it operates like StartsOnDesk. With three arguments,
it sets the desk and page. (With two arguments, it sets the page and uses
the current desk.)

        I hope this helps a bit.

        Hmmm. I'd think that this would be better put in your top level menu,
or in a button bar - though I can sympathize if you don't want your desktop
cluttered with button bars and such; I only bring my button bar up on
special occasions. Logically, it would seem more appropriate to bind
window-specific things to the window decorations. But, that's your choice.

        Possibly, but a revised Fvwm command language is probably a good
bit in the future. Instead of waiting around for that, why not try a bit
of ingenuity? You can do what you want with a little shell script that
interacts with Fvwm via FvwmCommand. Here's how you do it.

        First, bind whatever you like to a function you define in your
fvwm2rc, something like

        AddToFunc  ToggleAutoFunc
+                  "I"       Module FvwmCommandS
+                  "I"       Exec exec MyToggleAutoScript

        Next, you write MyToggleAutoScript in the language of your choice -
Bourne shell, Perl, Tcl, whatever. This script should

        1. Wait till it sees FvwmCommandS active
        2. Check whether FvwmAuto is active
        3. If FvwmAuto is active, send a KillModule command via FvwmCommand
        4. If it is not active, send a Module FvwmAuto command via FvwmCommand
        5. Wait for a respectable interval, and use FvwmCommand to send
           the command "KillModule FvwmCommandS"

(Of course, some people like to keep FvwmCommandS active all the time, which
would simplify the script, but why waste resources?)

        I know it's fashionable to argue for a new Fvwm command language 
that's a full programming language, but you'd be surprised what you can do
without that, using the facilities that exist now.

        Strange, mine do. I think it depends on what kind of buttons you're
using - a very flat looking button may not show much difference, if any, or
it could have to do with the color scheme you specify for the window 
decorations - and I'm not sure what happens if you use mini-icon style 
buttons.

However this server is not answering anything.
So where can I get the sorce?
Why isn't it stored on the official ftp server?

How about binding the following function to the button
AddToFunc ToggleAuto	"I" FvwmAuto 500
+			"I" Exec shell_script_to_kill_FvwmAuto_if_more_than_one

The shell_script_t.... will depend on your operating system but can run
a ps, grep, wc to count the number of FvwmAuto modules running and kill
them all if there is more than one.

This might be the way you have written your functions causing fvwm to
wait for the ClickTime (150ms) to work out if you are clicking or
dragging.  If you write your functions thus:

AddToFunc blahblah	"I" whatever
+			"I" whatever

then fvwm will not wait for ClickTime and will do whatever immediately. 
If you write them:

AddToFunc blahblah
+ "I" whatever
+ "I" whatever

it will wait even though you haven't got any "M", "C" or "D" lines in
the function.

Hope this helps,
Tim.

It would be intersting to be able to selectively have titlebars on the
bottom of windows -- either dynamically, or via the Style command. 
However, I think that this should be a seperate function that
compliments the windowshade function you described.

Most Style commands have a "style-option/oppositestyle-option" pair. 
Maybe all of these commands could have a 'toggle-option' varient as well
(or add a toggle modifier like so:

	Mouse 1 T A Toggle ClickToFocusDoesntRaise
). 

BTW: I am VERY happy to see that windowshade works properly in fvwm2! 
I'm definately staying with this wm!

I like very much mouseless operations on fvwm2 and at this moment I
like to switch focus by moving cursor with Hyper + vi-keys (Hyper is
my good old Caps-lock).  However, I am missing a function with which I could
warp directly to a window in some direction (north, east, etc.).

I think that this function would not be very hard to implement and I
might try to do this myself when I have time to examine the sources.
However, if somebody has done something similar, I would be pleased to
hear your solution.

Quick Summary:

Please add a "Solid" option to BorderStyle command, Also add "Fgcolor"
or "Textcolor" option to TitleStyle command.  Depreciate the use of the
HilightColor command.

-------------------

I've spent the last couple of days porting my environment from "another"
wm to fvwm2.  I've just been tweaking things lately, and I've found one
thing that seems too difficult: changing border colors...

Using what seems to be the "new" style syntax, it would make sense that
the border color for the Active and Inactive states would be set in the
BorderStyle command, but only a texture can be set here.

It would also make sense to set the title font color from the TitleStyle
command.

The HilightColor command seems like it _should_ be out of date given the
above commands.

I'd say keep The Color style option so that people can have different
colors for different windows.   I'm not exactly sure how this option
works, but you might also want to add options like "ActiveColor" and
"TiledPixmap", and "ActiveTiledPixmap" to the style command.

Please at least add pointers in the man pages to HilightColor and Color
from the BorderStyle and TitleStyle sections. -- When i saw you could
only set a texture using BorderStyle, I initially thought you couldn't
set the border to any color besides gray!

I'd Like to request an additional flag to allow the tilebar texture to
exist under each of the buttons and the title area as
_one_contiuous_pixmap_ instead of a new instance of the pixmap for each
widgit, wich doesn't look right if the texture doesn't tile, or is very
long.  This might also save memory.

This could be expanded to allowing the texture to exist under the entire
border area + the title + the buttons...

But you can create some very interesting effects with the way things are
now, so don't just disable the current behaviour! :)

You have a point here. The thing is that it is very easy to click on window titlebar

buttons because they are always in reach. So, for something I use so often as that I thought

a button binding would be OK. With my 4 buttons per window I can do 12 different things, so

really, I do have buttons to spare, and though not as intuitive as having this option in a menu,

it is much quicker.I prefer to use menus for applications instead (eg, pine, netscape, xxgdb, xclock,

xbiff, top, rsh, ftp, etc...)

Your suggestion is very neat and would probably do for now. It would be nice though

to be able to keep everthing in one file and not in a .fvwm2rc and a .sh file.

Thanks for your help,

It is not a release.  It is a testing version for use by the folks on
fvwm-workers.  If you want to talk about it, you should join the
fvwm-workers list.

Because it's not a release.

        That's the whole point of the X philosophy - flexibility to customize
your desktop in a way that lets you work comfortably and efficiently, not
necessarily the same way everyone else does. Go for it.

        Quite right, it would. However, I believe it will be a while before
the developers reach a consensus about what's to be done with Fvwm's command
language, and there are some significant architectural changes that really
need to be made - e.g., the famous Great Style Flag Rewrite (tm) - before
serious work is done on the command language. Also, Fvwm is in a state of
transition between the old and the new maintainer, which slows things down
a bit.

        That's why I suggested a technique you can use right now to get the
result you want. 

        Oh, yes. That one file. (I know, I'm shifting the emphasis of your
remark slightly.) You'll probably find, as you add enough stuff to that one
.fvwm2rc file, that it'll become *really* unmanageable, and you'll want to
split it into several smaller ones sourced by the main file. My present
.fvwm2rc is little more than a bunch of Read commands to pull in the various
other pieces, that are of a convenient editing size.

        I'd second that. I would find this far more useful than the
StaysOnTop style (I loathe in-yer-face windows). After the GSFR, I think
this one should go fairly high on the priority list. It's been requested
pretty often, so I think it'd be a reasonably popular feature.

Hi all,


I've been looking for a special biff to mount in fvwmbuttons.  I need an
xbiff that will allow me to:


1) select my own .xpm icons for mail/nomail states
2) will allow me to detect mail in specified account (including root
account)


I've tried several different biffs so far.  Asmail comes very close to
being perfect.  Unfortunately, when I run as my normal non-root account
- Asmail refuses to notify me of mail sent to the root account
(/var/spool/mail/root).  I've even tried running asmail inside
fvwmbuttons using sudo - oddly - it just will not detect mail sent to
root.

Does anybody know of a good x-biff that will work under my
requirements?  Any ideas appreciated....

I really want to set autoraise on a per-window(application) basis.

After spending a lot of attention porting and tweeking my wm enviroment,
I realised that with Netscape, autoraise (follows mouse) would be a
definate benifit.  Normally I LOATHE autoraise, but watching myself use
netscape, I spend a LOT of time switching between windows.  I went to
set AutoRaise on for just Netscape like all the other Styles, but found
that it had been changed into a module...  

It does not look like i can set autoraise on a per-application basis, am
I right?

I would really like to be able to do this.  Other windowmanagers let you
autoraise just the panner, for example (ctwm???).  

WHAT IF...  AutoRaise'ing a StaysOnBottom window causes it to jump to
the top of the windowlist while the mouse is over it, then pops back
down to the bottom when the mouse rolls off of it...

Here's an idea for ya!

Add a flag to the Windowshade function to enable this:  When the mouse
rolls over a windowshaded titlebar, the window temporarily unshades,
then reshades when the mouse rolls off the window again.  By rolling
over the titlebar, you suddenly have access to the whole window until
you're done, then just leave the window.  Some sort of feedback needs to
be determined for unshading the window while it's in it's temporary
"preview" mode.  Maybe flash the window's border, or something.

This would make fvwm2's windowshade more functional than anyone else's!

-----------------------

Adding this to the iconify'ed windows could also be useful.  When they
plop-up in to "preview" mode, they appear wherever the icon was.  When
you uniconify the window (say by clicking on the iconify button again in
the titlebar), it pops back to it's uniconified position.

Just don't turn these features on by default, or the Novice user could
go crazy :)

-----------------------

If wharf-like features are added to the fvwmbuttons, it would be a good
candidate for this plop-up function as well.  (e.g.. if the fvwmbuttons
could be "minimized" into a single button sitting in a corner of the
screen)  Just roll over it, and instant access!  Shaped buttons would be
a problem here, though :(... unless there was a small (user definable) 
delay on the reshade event.

Why do you deliver mail to root anyway?  You really ought to set up an
alias for root (and postmaster, and webmaster, etc.) that gets
delivered to the proper actual person.  That way you don't have to send
mail as <root@blah.blah.blah> also.

Have you tried xmailbox?  It allows you to specify a mailbox to monitor
as well.

You can do it indirectly with a conditional function.  e.g.

FvwmAuto 500 EnterFunc 

AddToFunc EnterFunc "I" Current [Netscape] Raise
+ "I" Current [SomeOtherAutoraiseAppClass] Raise
+ "I" Next [CurrentDesk *StaysOnBottom*] Lower

This should also keep anywindows on the bottom that have StaysOnBottom
in their name or icon title, it's a bit of a hack but most apps can be
given a title and if you set the style to have no title bar then you
might not notice.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'd just like to bring up an issue from waaaay back that is related.
Years ago now a patch was posted that put title-bars on the sides of
the windows.  I used to have a screenshot of this but I had to delete
it for space reasons. At the time it was only possible to specify all
your windows to have titlebars down the sides, and the drawback then
was that the text was not rotated and so looked a bit messy. 

What I would like to see implemented (big wishlist item this) is to
have the option to have a title bar wherever I want it. I would find
this useful when, for example I am editing a bunch of files with long
names. Because my text editor is taller than it is wide on the screen
there's more room down the side of the window than across the top.
However, I don't want xterm windows to have side title bars as I found
that it was inconvenient having the title bar next to the scroll bar
(what can I say, my aim is very bad)... 


Just a suggestion    ;)

how long should fvwm2 take to setup a desktop ? 


from the time my <.fvwm_xinitrc> starts my <.fvwm_Xclients>, until the last 
record in my <.FVWM2-errors> is written, i have timed it as 2.5 minutes.
(as the debug statemets in attached output show)

*that is 2.5 minutes before i see the first non-root window appear*


i am running intel RH 5.0 - XFree86 - fvwm2

my desktop setup includes 11 xterms and redbaron.

attached are the outputs from log files <.X_fvwm.log>  and  <.FVWM2-errors> 


thanks - josin

I agree that titlebars on "any surface" would be cool (and useful) even
if it's not a critical function.  

Also, shaped (or squeezed) titlebars (the kind that shrink down to just
the width of the text in the title) are very useful for tiling windows.

On my Mac, i use shaped titlebars and windowshade together to shade
several windows all on the same line. Since their titlebars are 1/3 the
size of the window, they can overlap and have still have their full
titles visable.  It saves quite a bit of screen space.

This is called "SqueezeTitle" in twm.  There's also a "DontSqueezeTitle"
so that you can selectively turn this off on a per window basis.  It's a
very powerful feature when combined with windowshade.  But I understand
the possible extent of recoding to make this happen...

I sorta like this, but it would also be a good idea to add an UnShadeTime
so that it waits a few seconds before unshading (say 1ms?), otherwise
people whom veer their mouse around all the time will have unnecessary
unshadings...

I don't think this should be the goal... to just be more functional... it
should be functional period.

I totally agree, I think these features will never be useful for me,
however they sound like good ideas :)

I agree, but what I was implying was that windowshade is already
functional, this next step would be a little more innovative than what
some of the other wm's are doing.  

(btw: "next step" was not a pun...)

Consider having all your Gimp pallets automagically shaded (or
iconified), plus this roll over function. That would be a perfect
example of how this could be extremely useful.

http://www.ews.uiuc.edu/~fvwm

has an fvwm manual written for the University of Illinois Engineering
Workstation labs.  Included are fvwm2rc and fvwm95rc files.

We are always changing the fvwm rc files and manual, but it may prove an

I use fvwm 2 using the 3Dpixmaps default fvwm2rc file.
Fvwmiconman is in the upper left corner by default. Since most programs
iconify to that area they wind up being covered by fvwmiconman.
I'd like to put it in the upper right corner and have it stay there.
I've made changes to the geometry settings with no change.

Here's what I believe are the relevant portion of .fvwm2rc (I think).


       *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 1
       *FvwmIconMan*resolution  global
       *FvwmIconMan*background  #A0A0A0
       *FvwmIconMan*foreground  black
       *FvwmIconMan*font "-adobe-new century schoolbook-bold-r-
           normal-*-10-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1"
#       *FvwmIconMan*font        7x13
       *FvwmIconMan*geometry    +909+0
       *FvwmIconMan*action      click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
#       *FvwmIconMan*action      select Focus 0
       *FvwmIconMan*showtitle   false
       *FvwmIconMan*followfocus true
       *FvwmIconMan*sort        true
       *FvwmIconMan*plainbutton          up black #A0A0A0
       *FvwmIconMan*selectbutton         down Wheat SlateBlue4
       *FvwmIconMan*focusbutton          up white brown
       *FvwmIconMan*focusandselectButton down Wheat SlateBlue4


Is the geometry setting correct? When I placed iconman where I want
it I checked with xwininfo and fvwmident to verify the position.
Can't RTFM due to the fact that I gzipped most of the man files,
backed it up, then deleted them from the drive (drive space is
down to almost nothing so lots of 'unnecessary' files have been
removed. Man I wish I had some money).
Also hope I sent to the correct address.

I have just made an experimental patch, which provides a new function
"FocusToDir north | east | south | west".  It moves the focus to the
closest window in the given direction and seems to be quite handy if
you like mouseless operations.

You can get the patch from "http://www.hut.fi/~thirsima/fvwm.html".
Mail me if you have problems with the patch - I must admit that I am
not very familiar with patches. :)

Hi folks

I put together a sort of historical (hysterical?) overview of all the
window managers I could find out about. I'd appreciate it if some of
the people here could take a look and let me know if I've got any of
my facts wrong or missed anything out.

I haven't tried this patch but I wonder if it is possible to make the
direction stuff a bit more general?  Instead of a new command that does
fixed things in a certain direction I think it might be nice to have it
take conditions like Next & Prev and execute a function on the selected
window e.g.

GoToDir [North !Iconic !*OnBottom*] my_funky_focus_function

GoToDir [South West !Iconic] focus_and_flash_border

Hope this helps
Tim.

Yes, you are absolutely right.  That would be a lot more useful.  
I think I will spend the next weekend hacking the sources more. :)

Hi,

everytime I (re)start fvwm2 I get a new Icon order in WinList. I have
no clue if there is any rule to this.

Is it? - If so, I would like to have my own.

Without looking at the source I would guess that winlist just dumps
out the stack of windows in the order they were reparented by fvwm.

You could try using FvwmIconman, which will sort the list, and can also
give different lists for different applications.

Also, the Perl module interface X11::Fvwm comes with an example winlist
replacement PerlTkWL, which you could hack around with to provide exactly
what you require. If you don't speak Perl, let me know what you're after
and maybe I'll do it for fun :-)

Are there any plans to make FVWM2 either KDE or Gnome aware? KDE tells
how
to make a window manager KDE aware in the source for KWM, and Gnome also
makes
their information available. Unfortunately, my C knowledge is too
limited to be
able to do it myself...

I use Fvwm Ver 1.23b. Normaly windows are configured to be user
placeable. But for the gimp this is rather annoying, so I want the
gimp to use SmartPlacement.  I tried

Style "gimp"       SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement

in .fvwmrc but it seems not to be possible to do that. Can this be
accomplished in another way?

        Whew! I don't think many people would even know where to lay their
hands on a copy of that release. The last Version 1 release was 1.24r. It's
the only one readily available, but no one has done any work on it in years.

        Have you looked at your man page for fvwm? I believe you'll find that
the various placement options were global in version 1. You'll need to upgrade
to version 2 to set them via the per-window Style options.

        Also, be aware that this Style spec will only work for the old Motif
version of the Gimp (0.54). The new GTK version uses different window names.

But I don't like the look and feel of fvwm2. Can I set up fvwm2 in a
way it resembles fvwm?

fvwm2 can be made to look like just about anything you want it to look
like.  Emulating fvwm1 should be no problem at all.

Long ago I made the transition from fvwm1  to fvwm2.  I don't remember
any   particular appearance change.   Is  there something specific you
didn't like?

Hi,

I'm new to fvwm2. Till recently I've used KDE, but since last week I'm
using fvwm2 + gnome 0.2. My machine is running debian hamm frozen (some
files are maybe a bit old :(). Here are my questions:

1. I want to make something similar with KDE win list. I've done this
till now:

*FvwmWinListBack DarkOliveGreen
*FvwmWinListFore PaleGoldenRod
*FvwmWinListFont -*-new century schoolbook-bold-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Focus
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListUseIconNames
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0
*FvwmWinListMinWidth 100
*FvwmWinListMaxWidth 100

The problem is that I would like to bind the Click 3 to "Popup
Window-Ops". If I simply do

*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Popup Window-Ops

the Window-Ops seems to be the Popup of the FvwmWinList. Instead, I want
it to be the Popup of the window's name I'm clicking on. For instance,
if I keep mouse over xtrem entry in the FvwmWinList and click 3, I want
to popup the Window-Ops of the xterm, not the Window-Ops of the
FvwmWinList.

2. I would like to keep the area of FvwmWinList and the area under it if
free of windows. Can this be handled automaticaly ? I mean by this at
least 2 things:
a) no window should be created with X geometry less than 100
(accordingly to my above setting)
b) maximizing should use all the area excepting the area of and under
FvwmWinList.

And now some gnome related questions:

3. Can I swalow the FvwmPager in the gnome panel ? If yes, then how it
can be done ?
4. Is there any working for making FvwmPager gnome compliant ?

TIA,

Ionutz

        Yes, Ric, that's what happens; and no, Gerd, there's not a
provision for specifying a sorting order to WinList.

        The re-ordering sounds like the old Fvwm-alters-the-stacking-
order-on-restart problem. My StackingOrder patch (in unofficial_patches)
corrects this, among other things, for 2.0.46.

OK, this may not even be an FVWM problem, but thanks in advance for any
help you can give me.  I have tried starting fvwm 3 different ways:

1.  I edited my .Xdefaults file and added

	*wmStartupCommand:	/usr/openwin/bin/fvwm2
	*waitWmTimeout:	1

    and started a CDE session.

2.  I set and exported OW_WINDOW_MANAGER=/usr/openwin/bin/fvwm2 in my .profile
    and started an OpenLook session.

3. I followed the advice of a post in the archives and set up an FVWM
session from the
    login screen.

ALL of these methods starts up fvwm2, but all of them suffer from the same
problem.  I have since learned that even a "straight" CDE session, using
dtwm, or a "straight" OpenLook session using olwm suffers from this problem
- after the window manager starts, it sits there for EXACTLY 10 minutes,
then starts the home or current session (i.e. starts up apps).

During the 10 minutes, the cursor is an hourglass, and the WM is
unresponsive.  What's even worse is that this problem only affects me.
Other users using the machine, even with the identical environment and
$HOME/.* files don't see the 10 minute delay.  I tried removing my $HOME
and making an empty one, thinking I had some wierd file in there, but it
still takes 10 minutes.

I tried doing a "ps" during the 10 minute hang and after, and they are
identical - no processes are started or finished (except, of course, for my
session apps), and no CPU is used during the 10 minutes.

Since there are no man pages available to me on any of the "dt" commands, I
tried copying all the startup files and adding "set -x" to them.  I though
the command "ttsession" was the culprit, but I'm not so sure.

Has anyone seen this behavior, or have a clue where there's a 10 minute
time out in the Solaris startup cr*p?

Since I'm seeing this with dtwm and olwm, I'm assuming this is NOT an FVWM
problem, so I will not trouble this list further with this issue, and thank
you for your indulgence in ranging off-topic.

The Daily Root on Themes.org

The Daily Root is a nice place, and every day a new root image is added...
some of them (like the missile one for 19980817) are especially nice when
stretched to fit your screen and dithered to black and white.

How might I save the order of my windows and then have fvwm return my
windows to this order with a single command? If new windows are
existent, I'd like them behind the ones listed in the saved order, and
if some of the window in the saved order are no longer existent, I'd
like such entries to be ignored. 

I'm guessing this will take some programming. I'm an utter novice at
fvwm programming so any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Alan

        Short answer:  Yes, of course you can. Look at the man page for
FvwmCommand.

        Longer answer:  There are 2 parts to this. First, you have to start
the FvwmCommandS module from Fvwm via the command

                Module FvwmCommandS

Then you can invoke FvwmCommand from a shell or another program, passing any
valid Fvwm command as an argument to Fvwmcommand, like

                FvwmCommand "Popup MyFavoriteMenu"

        You can even use this technique to have an external program instruct
Fvwm to restart itself. Better yet, you can instruct Fvwm to reload its
config file (via something like "Read ~/.fvwm2rc", followed by a "Recapture"
command) without doing a Restart - *if* (Great Big Flashy Caveat) you have a 
well-formed config file (none of the currently distributed samples qualifies).

        By "well-formed" I mean that every Fvwm entity - like functions,
menus, and decors - that has a Destroyxxx command associated with it, must
have a Destroyxxx command preceding its definition, e.g.,

  DestroyMenu  MyFavorites
  AddToMenu    MyFavorites  "MyFavoriteThings"     Title
  +                         "Raindrops On Roses"   Exec exec myprog1
  +                         "Whiskers On Kittens"  Exec exec myprog2

etc. Otherwise, you end up with doubled and tripled menus, functions that
repeat the same actions several times, etc.

        Brief scolding:  The use of FvwmCommand has been discussed in at
least 2 threads in the past month. The Fvwm home page has a link to the
mailing list archives, and the archives are keyword-searchable. Before
firing off a question like this to a mailing list, you really ought to
browse a few posts - like, say, the past month's worth - to get a feel for
the list's tone, just as you should do with a Usenet group. Had you done
this, you'd have seen the answer to your question. (If you have no net
access other than e-mail, please accept my apology and my sympathy.)

I assume that is bad. 

Using FvwmCommand results in an error of:

Hello,

How often have you opened up a menu in fvwm and you were just too close to

one of the borders of the screen?

I suggest adding an option to fvwm2 to do the following with Popup menus:

divide the screen into 4 quadrants:

|----------|----------|
|          |          |
|    2     |    1     |
|          |          |
|----------|----------|
|          |          |
|    3     |    4     |
|          |          |
|----------|----------|

In quadrant 2 popup menus act as they normally would.

In quadrants 1 and 4 the menus appear with the arrow widgets on the left 

of the menu and pointing to the left instead of being on the right pointing 

to the right.

In quadrants 3 and 4 menus are to fall upwards instead of downwards.

...

this scheme would have th advantage of redirecting menus away from boarders of 

screens thus making selection of items easier.

Best Regards,

Neil Zanella

I disagree; I think this adds complexity at the risk of confusing
the user. Personally, I'd be always trying to second-guess the window
manager's choice of menu direction.

That said, I wonder if anyone's ever tried using vertical mouse movement
as the hint on which way to pop a menu? i.e., I click on the root window
and begin dragging down, THEN the menu appears in the direction I just
moved the mouse.

As for the horizontal submenus, I use 'em, I hate 'em. The arrows are
too small, I'm always chasing them to get the right one to pop out
(My mouse doesn't track very well either). When the wrong one pops up,
it invariably covers the arrow of the menu I wanted to use, etc. etc.

Has anyone ever used piewm? I haven't, but I was tempted more than
once.  It is(was?) a twm clone with round, pie-shaped popup menus,
apparently. The documentation said that selecting an entry by flicking
the mouse radially was a quicker and more natural method than going down
a vertical list of choices.

As you can see, I expect a lot more out of a change in the menu interface :-)
Don't get me wrong, the popup menus are OK as-is, I use them quite often
to start netscape, remote logins, and window operations. But I'd certainly
appreciate a higher level of control over their look-and-feel. Yeah,
yeah, modules can probably do all that, but they might introduce too
much latency.

When and if we ever see another release of fvwm2, the menu code will
include the animated menu patch, solving the menu placement problems.

My own opinion is, use the keyboard to operate your menus.

Perhaps the users list could have an update on where the next release
is?  I think I remember hearing the new maintainer was going to put
out a release including all the recent patches, but then I think that
got postponed.  The "official" web page hasn't been updated since
May.  If the workers list is active, perhaps other regular users would
be as interested as I am in a brief monthly update on how things are
going?

        That is bad. (That's what FvwmCommandS says when you kill it
normally with KillModule, though.)

        I have no idea what's going on here. I've never had it fail to
start up, so any suggestions I make are pure guesswork.

        1) Was FvwmCommandS compiled at the same time as the main part
of Fvwm - same compiler release, libs, etc.?

        2) Someone else recently reported that he couldn't get FvwmCommandS
to start properly from his InitFunction (Vikas, are you following this one,
and have you made any progress?) If that's how you're starting it, try 
putting it into a menu and invoke it after Fvwm gets started up. If this
makes a difference, at least we have a clue about where to look. I'm not
sure what we'd be looking for - some kind of timing quirk, I guess - I can't
make it fail this way, either.

        This is the normal response from FvwmCommand if FvwmCommandS is
not active.


> PS: this is version Ver. 1.5 of FvwmCommand, ver. 2.0.46 of Fvwm2, libc6

        This is curious - where did your Fvwm come from? The FvwmCommand in
my copy of Fvwm 2.0.46 identifies itself as version 1.4. Unless that's a
typo, there may be something fishy here.

I got version 1.5 here:
http://www.concentric.net/~isogai/fvwm2/fvwm2.shtml

The basic fvmw2 and FvwmCommand are compiled now, with the same compiler.
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)

Still the same results: dead pipe

Method of starting has no effect. All of the follow methods fail.

# Stuff to do at start-up
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x25+3+2 -ls -sl 200
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons
+ "I" Module FvwmCommandS

AddToFunc "RestartFunction" "I" Module FvwmButtons
+ "I" Module FvwmCommandS 

AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "Modules" Title
+ "CommandS"                    Module FvwmCommandS

I even used a striped down .fvwm2rc, same results.

Hello,

I really would like to have more popup meus without having to use

modifiers from my keyboard. My menus are getting cluttered.

So, it would be nice if it were possible to bind menus not only to

mouse buttons 1, 2, and 3, but also to combinations of them, ie., also

to mouse buttons: 1&2, 1&3, 2&3, and 1&2&3

Wouldn't that be just great?

Neil

        I'm still at a loss to know what's happening. I grabbed Toshi's
1.5 version and installed it, and everything still works fine on my system.
Duhhh...

        There could be some Glibc-related quirk, but I can't help you there.
I'm still running a libc5 system, so I'm not up on which Glibc releases had
what bugs.

        Since Toshi has obviously working on FvwmCommand, you might try
e-mailing him directly to see whether he has any ideas. I don't know how
regularly he follows the mailing list, though he does post here from time 
to time.

I run FreeBSD, and one of the applications has trouble, in that it keeps
on getting FVWM to stop recognizing the control-arrow keys as commands
to change screens.  The app, cvsup, is written in Modula-3, which I
strongly suspect is the problem.  Could anyone suggest anything I might
look at first, in order to track this problem down closer, or maybe get
FVWM to protect itself better against this?

BTW, I can always get things back the way I want them by restarting
FVWM, but when I give any command to cvsup, the control keys stop
allowing screen change again.  It's a major pain, because I use cvsup
all the time.

Well, no progress. But just yesterday my NT machine BSOD'ed and I had to
restart everything. Again, FvwmCommandS failed to start up via the
InitFunction. I had to start it via my menu entry.

So, coming to think of it, I have _never_ gracefully shutdown and restarted
Fvwm. It has always been due to some emergency, (NT crash, fvwm freeze
during Recapture or Restart, etc). BTW, I am running NT4.0 SP3 with
Netmanage Chameleon UnixLink as my X server.

Leads me to believe that the .FvwmCommandC/S pipes are never cleaned up and
so FvwmCommandS somehow croaks in the InitFunction. Dunno why the menu
entry works though!

Later,
Vikas

I have never tested FvwmCommand on glibc myself. But, I exchanged emails
with Martin Bialasinski to make it work on his system, which is a glibc
machine. Version 1.5 includes that fix. (His problem was not "dead pipe"
by the way, but related with xdm.)

Checking back those emails, I did not get a confirmation from him if
he took the tar file from my web page and run as it is.

Can anybody else confirm if it works on glib systems ?

Maybe, you have already told us, but which version of FvwmCommand are you
using?=20

By a slight chance if it is 1.4 and you are using xdm, version 1.5
should fix it.=20

I don't think fifos are the problem in your case. They will be overwritten
when a new ones are created, as you run FvwmCommand from menu.=20

I seem to remember having trouble starting it from InitFunction. I now
just put the single line:

Module FvwmCommandS

in my .fvwm2rc, and that works fine.

I am using the FvwmCommandS that comes bundled with fvwm 2.0.46. I think it
is 1.4. I am not using XDM.

Where can I download newer versions from? Do fvwm2 modules have their own
home pages hosted by the individual module authors? Pointers?

Hm. As someone else pointed out, I'll try putting in a line
Module FvwmCommandS 
in my fvwm2rc independent of menus, InitFunction, RestartFunction.

Strange problem though since Bob is unable to reproduce it.

Well, not for me.  I'm still convinced that the only way to operate
menus is thru the keyboard.

If you look at the way X reports mouse  events, you will see that this
is not an fvwm2 issue.   Fvwm2 will always see  the the button presses
as separate events.

I believe that some of the X servers  have a way of reporting multiple
button pushes as button 4, and button 5,  in which case Fvwm2 would be
able to accept more button bindings.

help !

[this is in a Linux RedHat Intel 5.0 system -- Xfree86 fvwm2]


i am trying to compile  FvwmCommandS.c under the directory:

/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/fvwm-2.0.46/extras/FvwmCommand

i get redefinitions (see below) from the system include files...

what is the best way of dealing with this without editing the latter ? 

- thanks - josin

ps: my Imakefile is included as attachment, just in case...

This happens because you have an old FvwmCommand that is incompatible with
glibc, which come in RedHat 5.x.

You can get the latest FvwmCommand from

bit of setup wasn't yet done when the InitFunction was called. This command
will be executed *before* InitFunction is invoked.

        So now this leaves me wondering if it's related to xdm, as Toshi
suggested.

Hi,

I am running Linux with fvwm2 as the window manager.  When I 
try to run framemaker remotely, it core dumps.  Is there 
something wrong with my configuration file?  Thanks for any
help.

probablly not framemaker has a bad habit of righting stuff to /dev/console
not telling you why it failed.

I run it remoletely from a solaris machine to linux all the time and it
works fine.

Check things like available memory/swap and your limits

Hello,

I am running Fvwm 2.0.46. I like to use SloppyFocus to give focus to windows
since it's definitely more convenient than the other solutions.

However, sometimes I would like to use keyboard bindings to give focus to
windows. Linux users who dual boot like myself are probably familiar with
this concept since win95 uses it (I forget which keys are boud to the "give
focus to another window" action in win95).

So, how can I implement this feature in Fvwm2?

The two mail reasons for which this functionality is useful are:

1) It makes things faster since you don't have to reach out to the mouse
   at least when just using xterms with text based programs in them.
   
2) Another application of this feature is the following:
   In Netscape, when you point with the mouse at a link you see the
   actual URL on the bottom part of the browser. Suppose you wanted to copy such   URL down. You could leave the mouse pointing there and switch to another
   text based window and copy it down. So, it seems useful that you be
   able to use both the cursor within an Xterm and the X cursor for combined
   functionality.

Of course, other uses could also apply.

BTW, to restore SloppyFocus one would just have to move the X cursor to a
window border.

If the functionality I describe or a similar one already exists then please
reply either to the mailing list or in person at: nzanella@cs.mun.ca

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

You,ve probably run into problems with your compiler options. I would
specify only the options that are necessary in the Makefile. Also, the
"-xF" seems to have been specified twice. Hope this helps.


Cheers,
Ashu

It seems the compiler options specified are generated by a standard Solaris
2.5.1
imake configuration file, which assumes Sun CC to be present. either use Sun
CC,
or adjust  your /usr/openwin/lib/config/site.def to include HasGcc2 
(see /usr/openwin/lib/config/sun.cf to see why).
If both of these aren't valid options, use your own xmkmf pointing to your
own
configuration files. If you don't know how to do this, there should be a
script to
generate makefiles for fvwm which will help you out in this case, but
doesn't with
other xmkmf requiering applications.

Regards,
	-Stefan

Hi,

I am trying to get a background xpm in an xterm like application. 
I am currently using fvwm-1.24r.  I thought that could be done with
rxvt-2.20, at least the man page for rxvt mention the option for the
resource file 

*backgroundPixmap:

or the

 -pixmap:

 option  but I am having no success with these?  Can some one help
 me on this? 


Cheers

	Well, Toshi, it would seem that I spoke too soon. The new FvwmCommandS
(1.5) starts up just fine, and will respond to simple commands, but not quite
everything still works fine.

	I use a little script to cause Fvwm to re-read .fvwm2rc without restarting.
Here is the pertinent part of the script:

    #  If we found the pid of an active FvwmCommandS, order a reconfig.
    if [ "$FPID" != "" ]; then
      FvwmCommand "Read $RCFILE" "Recapture"
      sleep 5s
      FvwmCommand -w 0 "KillModule FvwmCommandS";
      fi

	What happens now is that only the first command arg gets executed, whereas
formerly both did. I also tried splitting the first command into two, i.e.,

      FvwmCommand "Read $RCFILE"
      FvwmCommand "Recapture"

but it makes no difference. You can keep sending things to fvwmCommandS with
FvwmCommand, but FvwmCommandS doesn't seem to send anything else to Fvwm after
the first command. (Needless to say, in this example, the crippled FvwmCommandS
just hangs around till I kill it, because it doesn't send the KillModule
requesting its own demise. Er, did you insert a Survival Instinct option into
this version?)

	I still haven't figured out how to reproduce the symptoms others have
reported, but there does seem to be some breakage in this version. Any idea
what might be going wrong?

As far as I know there's only one version of rxvt that supports
background pixmaps. It was hacked by someone a couple of years ago. If
you want it you can get it from my web site.

	I believe that the mainstream rxvt introduced pixmap bg
support a while back.

Indeed it did, but you have to explicitly compile in xpm support.
Type 'rxvt -help' and the top of the output should look a little like
this:

  $ rxvt -help
  Usage v2.4.6 : (XPM,menubar,.Xdefaults)
  ...
                  ^^^

If the "XPM" is missing you'll need to recompile. Grabe the latest
version (v2.4.6) from
  http://babayaga.math.fu-berlin.de:80/%7Erxvt/distribution.html
and make sure you run configure with the '--with-xpm' option
('./configure -help' for more details).

If you still have problems there is an rxvt list (see web page).

You can either use X resources or an invocation like this to
set the pixmap:

  rxvt -pixmap "file.xpm;100"


On my webpage I have a very simple Perl script to pass random pixmaps
to rxvt (or any random argument to any program), like this:

  random -d ~/lib/pix rxvt -pixmap "%s\;100"

The script replaces the %s with the name of a random file from the
directory ~/lib/pix/.


You might also look at eterm (http://www.tcserv.com/Eterm/), a hack of
rxvt by the Enlightenment crowd.

I had compiling problems, say reading problems!  I just look back at
the INSTALL file which mention the use of ./configure --help ! It
took me a bout a 5 minutes to get the thing working with background
xpm after your post!  Thanks also for your input on how to use the
option.

       FvwmCommand "Read .fvwm2rc" "Recapture"  
 	
This works for me. It must be your $RCFILE. Do you get the same result 
with something simple?

	Well, golly, it works just fine for me too, if I make sure that I'm
using the 1.5 FvwmCommand to talk to the 1.5 FvwmCommandS. In the process of
switching back and forth between 1.4 and 1.5 to try to find a way to duplicate
the other problems that have been reported, I'd gotten my wires crossed and
had left the 1.4 FvwmCommand trying to talk to your new FvwmCommandS. I can't
say that I recommend this practice.

	Sorry to bother you.

Where in the world is Orlando Andico?  The last several links given in
the mailing archive are all defunct. (as recent as July 98)


Can anyone summarize for me the differences of Matt Baron's Panel and
Orlando Andico's FVWMCDE?

Can anyone post a release of the FVWMCDE since Orly can't seem to keep
his up ?!?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
