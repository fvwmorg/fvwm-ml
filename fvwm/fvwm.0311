There seems to be a problem with the latest source rpms of fvwm and
fvwm-theme.  Running ``rpm -qip'' on them results in ``error: query of
<fvwm or fvwm-themes>.src.rpm failed'' and ``rpm -ivh'' yields no progress hash
marks and no files installed under /usr/src/RPM/S*.  Attempting to
browse into them with mc gives ``Error Inconsistent extfs archive''.
Oh, and I tried downloading from two or three different sf sources as
well and got the same results.

that desklet window is kindof cut off for me too, I also tried using them 
with twm, and the desklets moved by themselves! they were trying to get 
away from my mouse pointer. (but they weren't cut off in twm). Anyways, I 
would suggest playing with fvwm's gnome and ewmh styles, they are 
explained in the man page. Not sure if it will help but its worth a try...

What is your distribution and rpm version?

It works with RH 7.2 and RPM version 4.0.3.

To actually rebuild the binary rpm from source rpm, you should create
one symbolic link at /tmp, this is to work around the problem that
different distributions have different locations of /usr/src/redhat,
/usr/src/RPM and so on.

Anyway, you should try to solve this yourself, since I don't know how to
create a better src rpm for you distro. If you fail, just download fvwm
and fvwm-themes sources (use: cvs checkout -r version-0_7_0 fvwm-themes)
and then "make rpm-dist" after the devel procedure of creating makefiles.
The same for creating debs for different architectures ("make deb-dist"),

Creating rpms from sources (not from src.rpm) is explained on fvwm.org.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

I'm using 2.5.7.

I have a problem with titlebar buttons of dialog windows: when a dialog
window pops up, it has the two rightmost buttons stripped off. So it
happens that my rightmost button is the "close" button. I think that this is
the one that ought to stay there, and the rest should be stripped off.
Unfortunately I don't have any other WM to verify that right now, but I
think that's the way things are usually done.

This are my bindings for the buttons:

Mouse 0   1  A Menu Window-Ops
Mouse 0   2  A Close
Mouse 0   4  A Maximize 100 100
Mouse 0   6  A Resize 580p 780p
Mouse 0   8  A Iconify toggle
Mouse 0   0  A Stick toggle

Out of those only 0, 8 and 6 appear in dialog windows. I would expect to
have the "Close" (i.e. the rightmost in a "standard" configuration)
button preserved.

When I revert to the "standard" configuration (the (Iconify, Maximize,
Close) triple), the behavior is the same - only the Iconify button is
visible.

I'm not sure if this is an fvwm issue, but I think I had this close
button visible in other WMs.

Thanks,
Piotr

That's great and all, but what do I tell Sun.  "Fix RM6 'cause it dies 
on FVWM" is not going to go too far.  They're going to tell me to use a 
window manager that supports it, just like EMC did.

I thought what I was implying in the last post was that I need to know 
WHAT to tell Sun (and Checkpoint/EMC if their apps continue to be a 
problem).

I looked through the posts, but I have no idea what to pull out and 
present to Sun.  Remember, I am not a developer, so help me out here.

Ask them to look at this post:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0212/msg00286.html

I believe it summarizes our findings.

As far as their statement about using another window manager,
I don't know what to tell you.

Excellent.  I'll log the call today.  Should I post updates to the list?

Well, that's what an EMC employee told me to do.  I raised this issue 
with them a while back (probably 2 or so years) and that's what they 
told me.  That was verbal, so I have nothing to fall back on.  It was 
something like FVWM didn't handle something that their app was depending 
on or some strange thing.

When I read that FVWM is ICCCM-compliant, what's that implying?  Is that 
a standard?  Are X applications supposed to be written to a standard?

I don't mean to throw something else into the mix here, but I did some 
"testing" before I'd get Sun involved.  I remembered a while back when I 
was looking into this that I stumbled on something, but don't think I 
ever made sure of my findings.

Turns out, the two windows that act up at for me don't act up by 
themselves.  Meaning, if I have RM6 and/or the EDM GUI running, things 
seem fine.  This leads me to believe there's another application in the 
mix that's introducing something strange into the environment that's 
causing the entire problem.  Could this be the case?

Here's why I think that.  At work, I run Checkpoint's PolicyEditor. 
While that was running, I started my EDM GUI.  The main window briefly 
opened, but exited just after the "About" window closed.  I closed the 
Checkpoint GUI and restarted the EDM GUI, which now functioned properly. 
  I then remembered RM6 showed symptoms while the EDM symptom was there. 
  I closed the EDM GUI, started Checkpoint, and then started RM6.  Sure 
enough, when moving the pointer over the buttons that pop-up the balloon 
help, the window died, which (I think) is the symptom that most people 
are complaining about.

So, my problems only appeared to be present when the Checkpoint GUI was 
up and running.  This was until I noticed yesterday that both RM6's and 
the EDM's symptoms were still present even though the Checkpoint GUI had 
no longer been running.  (Maybe there's residual effects from having 
that window open?)

So, thinking back, I remembered that I had been running VMWare 
Workstation v3.x while my problems were present the first time around. 
I grabbed a copy of WMWare 3.x today and started it up (you only need to 
run vmware-config.pl and then start the vmware binary to see the 
problem, no need to actually install a vmware host).  The problem was 
there.  I stopped VMWare and the problem went away.

Note I started v3.x.  The new version of VMWare (4.x) does NOT produce 
the symptoms in RM6 and the EDM GUI.

What do you think about this?  Could it be that the problem is VMWare 
3.x and the Checkpoint GUI instead of the other two (RM6 and EDM GUI)? 
Is it possible that something strange is being introduced that's 
screwing up the other apps?

Well, I was able to keep the desklets from moving...by placing
StaysOnBottom in my Style options

I will look at the gnome and ewmh styles you suggested. 

The other problem I have noticed with the the StarterBar in gdesklets is
that it will only open the last starter on the bar.  A problem I will
ask the gdesklet developer.  Just odd

If I could get FvwmButtons/FvwmAnimate to do bouncing buttons and mouse
over effects I wouldn't bother....have I mentioned how much I like eye
candy?

Thanks for the help

OK.  I usually have no problem querying, mc-ing, installing, or
rebuilding srpms---regardless of whether the srpm is intended for a
particular distribution.  And past srpms for fvwm and fvwm-themes worked
just fine.  That's the only reason I thought there was a problem with
the files.

I'll keep that in mind.  Thanks for the information.

OK, will do.

Yes, the ICCCM specifies how the window manager and clients are supposed
to act.

As I remember, when I did some testing with this, I was using
a virtual X environment so RM6 was running by itself.
One "quirk" is that I would get the problem when the virtual X
environment was set up with
$DISPLAY set to X:0 and it would work fine with $DISPLAY as X:1.

I think that just illustrates that something random is going on.
None of this helps me, or anyone else that followed along with
the debugging to figure out what was going on.

No, unfortunately.  All he told me was to use a different window manager.

OK.  I just thought it was really strange that my symptoms show up only 
when there's other programs running, and go away when those programs are 
not running.

Is there no way to see if that triggers any weird conditions by a log or 
anything?  (Grasping...)

What problem did you see when you were testing with RM6 by itself?  Was 
it the same problem I described?  I'll try to reproduce and add that to 
the case to Sun.

Take a look at:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0212/msg00286.html

(same URL)
those were all the logs I could figure out how to create.

The symptom was the application closing itself.

I actually went to the download page and I see all rpms are corrupted.
The tarballs are ok though (transfered from a different machine).

This should be a bug in ftpd. I always explicitelly set binary mode
(although this should be a default between unices anyway).

I removed all rpms and will retransfer them soon. The release number
will be "2" this time.

Sorry for inconvenience.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just checked things on :1.  I get the same results.  One strange thing, 
though.  Check out the following sequences...

* Started RM6
   Opened "Status"
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" button and received the balloon help.
   Closed RM6

* Started VMWare
   Started RM6
   Opened "Status"
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" button and "Status" window died.
   Closed RM6
   Closed VMWare

* Started RM6
   Opened "Status"
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" button and received the balloon help.
   Opened VMWare
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" button and received the balloon help.
   Opened second "Status" window
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" in "Status (2)" and "Status (2)" died.
   Moved mouse over "Select Module" in "Status" and received the balloon 
help.

Whatever random thing is going on seems to be activated by the problem 
window, in this case VMWare, and doesn't seem to affect already running 
windows.

Would you want me try to capture some debugging information while going 
through this sequence?  Would that help at all?

No, I already have
all the traces that it is possible to produce.  Without the source
code to the application, I can't deduce why the application decides
it is going to close itself.

You PAID for support for the application you are running.
Get them to do some work on this.

OK.  I'm currently logging the call with Sun support, but wanted to make 
sure I can reference you in the call.  I don't know for sure, but I 
gather from what I've read that you are one of the developers?

Is it OK if I do that?

I just logged the call.  I decided not to reference any names right off 
the bat.  If they need contact information in the future, I can point 
them to your e-mail or the list.

Let me know if you want me to e-mail you a copy of the service request. 
  If not, I'll just post any updates as they happen.

Thanks.

I do occasional development.
It would be best if you give them:

fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

If they don't want anything that public, they can contact me directly.

	Looks great!  Congrats to all who contributed, directly or indirectly.
I'm particularly please to see the ne artwork, some of which I've used
in my personal setup for quite a while now.

	The screenshot link for "BlueMix" is broken, by the way. It points to

http://fvwm.org/screenshots/Mikhael-desk-1280x1024/screenshot.png

and I believe it should be

http://fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/Mikhael-desk-1280x1024/screenshot.png


Cheers,
Bob

Works fine now, thanks a lot.

P.S. I looked at the manpage and voila, it's all there. It's just hard
to find the information you want in that flat structure, especially if
you don't exactly know what you're looking for. I think you would guys
have a lot less headache with answering such trivial questions if you
just split up the monster-manpage into some sort of structural document.
Anyway, thanks again for the answer and the quality work you do.

Hi,

i tried fvwm2.5.8 on solaris8.

configured options: 
> fvwm-config -s
gettext
gtk
gdk-imlib
perllib
png
readline
shape
shm
sm
xpm


The build went OK, but after installing and restarting the probelms began:

1) Very slow startup
2) FvwmPager is very slow on showing mini icons
3) Menus are drawn VERY slowly. (all menus, static and dynamic)
4) icons in menus are sometimes wrongly drawn (have some "noise" on them)

It seems that fvwm2.5.8 runs significantly slowly than 2.5.7 (2.5.7 was as fast as a lightning).


finaly i had to recompile 2.5.7 (same options) and return to the older version...

Did anyone else encounter the problems ???

regards

avi

As the executor and trustee, you will receive the 25 Million dollars on trust, to invest on above and others, be informed that this is protected under the international probate law, and all probate paper will be notarised and stamped in your favour. The fund will be paid directly to you, through our on line bankers for you to administer according to the humanitarian instruction left with our bank by Mr Lim Kwoon.

With the latest CVS, you can do:

Mouse 2 M N -

to remove the binding.

hi,
few weeks ago I have asked You what should be done to get the root menu 
disappeaered always when the mouse button is released.
some people wrote that I should use popup instead of menu, so I did 
that, but the popup is not exactly what I would have.
the popup will not work for me, because when I drag the mouse cursor 
with pressed button and after a while I release the button the menu 
stays on top.
I would have rather a menu that is dissappearing than stays.
I know that I can use Esc then ;-), but maybe there is a better solution 
to do this automatically.
this is the last thing that I would like to know to customize fvwm as my 
best wm.
best regards.

Yes.  258 on solaris 8
Doing *anything* was so slow that it took a loooong time just to get my
menu to switch me back to 257, which then ran ok.

I did have to add --with-iconv-library=no and hand remove debian from
the Makefile list to get it to compile....things i didnt have to do for 257.

That depends on the resources available on your X server.  On one
hand, rendering images in all title bars might be too slow for
your liking, on the other hands the images consume RAM on the
server (about Width x Height x (Depth / 8) bytes).  So, you should
not put wallpapers in window titles.  Usually, images in titles
are pretty small, but remember that the X server stores a copy of
the original image for each window where it is used as a
background.

Do you mean the window title with "label"?  If so, try

  Style FvwmTaskBar NoTitle

That ususally happens when applications try to place their dialog
windows on their own.  Try

  Style window_name nopposition, NoTransientPPosition

and if that does not hel, try this too:

  Style window_name nousposition, NoTransientUSPosition

Perhaps if you rephrase what exactly it is you are trying to

That's a job for FvwmAuto or FvwmEvent.  You want to react to
enter/leave window events.  It's probably best to make a separate
window for this purpose.

The reverse of what?  Isn't that exactly what you described above?

No.  Colour sets are not fully supported in window decorations.
Only the plain colours are used in the window border.  This is
going to change some day.

In 2.5.8, styles can be tied to individual windows too.  I don't
know the name of the command that does this from the top of my
head.  You will probably need FvwmEvent too, or maybe a function
like this:

  AddToFunc start_borderless
  + I exec exec $1
  + I wait $0
  + I next ($0) thiswindow <style_by_id_command> $w <styles>

Try running fvwm without a configuration file at all.  Does it
still happen?

  $ fvwm -f /dev/null

What you describe suggests that at least two applications
(FvwmPager and fvwm itself) have gone crazy at the same time.
This is extremely unlikely to happen, since both programs are
fairly independent of each other.  Chances are good you
encountered a bug in the X server itself that surfaces under
obscure circumstances only.  Can you try a different version of
the X server?  (By the way, most of all the weird, ureproducible
problems people have are on Sun systems.  This may be a hint that
the X server isn't very stable).

Sorry for my English.
I want to see the root menu disappeaered always when I release the mouse 
button.
Of course first I am making the menu visible by pushing the mouse button.
The menu has sub-menus.
I can not explain this another way (I tried several times without result).
The fvwm menu or popup menu is good, but I want a menu that will be only 
visible when a mouse button is pressed.
For example - when I push mouse button and drag over the menu, the menu 
want not disappear - I have to click somewhere else or push the escape key.
For example the window list works like I want when I hoose the window 
list by key.
When I release the window list by mouse and drag over the window - the 
menu (window?) stays on top till I click somewhere else.
Sorry for boring mails & bye.

1) If you speak about normal Popup menus bound to Mouse, I already
answered this here:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0310/msg00191.html

If I undersand you correctly, you want to click into any submenu and have
the main menu disappear. This is not possible. Do not click into a
submenu. Click (I mean release the mouse button) outside of the menu, or
in the menu title area if you use mouse buttons 1 and 3 for dragging.

> For example the window list works like I want when I hoose the window 
> list by key.
> When I release the window list by mouse and drag over the window - the

2) WindowList command is a different issue than Menu/Popup.
WindowList is always Menu, it can't be done Popup.

It's not possible currently. Actually, you may try to use FvwmWindowMenu
module instead of WindowList, it supports both Popup and Menu behaviours.
But FvwmWindowMenu is not currently as good as WindowList.

3) Another issue is that you invoke your WindowList using Mouse 2 and
Mouse 2 is used internally to tear off window (convert menu to window
with normal window borders and title). It is possible to disable this
teat off behaviour in 2.5.9 (from cvs), but not in fvwm 2.5.8.


Marcin, I hope you understand that these are completely 3 separate issues.
Please, when you ask next time about menus, specify which case you have
in mind, or better yet, post the relevant Mouse and AddToMenu commands,
so we may try your config too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I committed a patch a minute ago that makes it possible:

  MenuStyle * PopupClose
  mouse 1 r a popup rootmenu nop

You need the latest CVS code for this (or wait for tomorrow's
snapshot or wait for 2.5.9).

Ciao

I figured it out later that if you dont set any configuration for the
name that you can just use a button. Or use
FvwmTaskBar: NoDefaultStartButton

There are parts of FvwmButtons I like and Parts of FvwmTaskBar that I
like.  Getting closer with each one to get it to do what I want it do
but not quite....will keep working on it.

Thanks!

+ I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n !Borders
+ I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
+ I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles

This is what worked with 2.5.7, to have fullscreen-windows without

How can I get rid of the borders in fullscreen?

See NEWS file, some new commands were renamed. Here is the 2.5.8 way
(taken from fvwm-themes 0.7.0):

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
+ I ThisWindow (Maximized) WindowStyle Title, Borders
+ I TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title, !Borders
+ I TestRc (!Match) Raise
+ I TestRc (!Match) UpdateStyles
+ I Maximize ewmhiwa

Gregg,

Did you ever file a bug report at Sun?

Ryan has made an attempt.  I think it might help if another customer
tried also.

Did you encounter this problem using Sun's X server or was it
some other X server?

Gregg,

What was the problem you were seeing?  How did the problem arise?  Was 
rm6 the only application running at the time?

As Dan said, I have a case open with Sun.  Hopefully we'll make some 
progress.

Hallo,
I have several questions:
1) Is it possible to have transparent menu, window title or any of the 
fvwm window item?
2) How to change color of the menu borders, triangles (also when the 
menu item with the triangle is selected)?
Thank You very much for the help.

Here's my original post from about a year ago:
------------------ START
Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

We are trying to run Sun's RAID Manager GUI, rm6.  When it runs, it
displays
a box of icons that lets the user launch child GUI processes (similar to
the
CDE App Manager).  FvwmIdent shows all the rm6 GUIs to be class
"OpenInterface", resource "openedit".

Some of the child process GUIs have a Toolbar.  When you roam the mouse
over
one of the toolbar buttons, a popup tooltip is supposed to appear.  What
happens is, you get the tooltip for a few milliseconds, then the child
GUI's
process exits normally (status 0), as if it had received a close request
from the window manager.  Truss reveals no obvious "smoking gun".

I tried using the default (built-in) fvwm2 configuration and got the
same
result.

I went back to my regular configuration and tried using the keyboard
mapping
to move the mouse (Alt + arrow keys).  I can move the mouse over the
toolbar
buttons, and the process stays up, but then, the tooltip never appears.

The rm6 GUIs work fine under olwm, dtwm and twm.  Any suggestions are
very
welcome.
------------------ END

More details:  This was on a SunFire running Solaris 2.8's Xsun server
with all of Sun's recommended patches.  No other GUIs running.

As I mentioned last week, Sun was contacted about the problem but was
disinclined to open a bug report.  They would only agree to open a
"request for enhancement" to be sent to the vendor.  We could have
pressed them for a higher priority action, but we subsequently dropped
RM6 and so didn't pursue it.

OK, so you were running FVWM on Solaris.  That's the similar thing in 
both of these issues.

I was wondering if I displayed the CP gui to a Sun box and opened RM6 if 
I would see similar results.  I'm still going to try that to see what 
happens.  I can do it both on CDE and on FVWM.  I'll post the results.

Thanks.

Hi,

I have an FvwmButtons whose ButtonGeometry is 52x52 (so I can
have a relief of 2, and 48x48 icons).  This doesn't evenly divide
my screen width, 1600.  Is there some way to make FvwmButtons be
a particular size that is not a multiple of the ButtonGeometry?
I would like to be able to put a button aligned to the right side
of the screen, but that would not line up on the button grid.

Thanks,
	- Ian.

Well, it just occurred to me that I can set the ButtonGeometry
width and/or height to 1 and adjust the geometry of each button
accordingly.  This works, but internally, is it wasting a lot of
memory or resources?  I don't like to be wasteful. :)

I have a wish for the next fvwm and fvwm-themes.
We should to leave from default include of the xbiff.
This application is very old and also wrong programmed.
For energie save solutions ist this Program not usable, because it make
sequential access of the HD. The HD will never spin down.

I suggest to design a other mechanism.
i.e. usable is the program procmail to run several applicationen, if
mail is received.
Procmail start if mail will be received and if there are a file
~/.procmail or if there are a entry in ~/.forward.

I can also if i receive any Mail (i can even differ by from or subject)
run any application.

i.e. We can change a Icon from FvwmButtons while fvwm is runing.

Is this possible with FvwmButton?
I know it is possible if i use swallow Buttons.
But there must be a extra Program change this Icon.
I would like to prefer a more elegant solution.
I would run a program like this "FvwmCommand IconStyle BlahBlah
new.icon"

Such a solution should also in fvwm and Linux move in.

Any opinions?

Andrei

Yes, this is possible using Colorset functionality in fvwm 2.5.x.
Examples were posted on this list in the past.

This is possible using Colorset functionality in both 2.4.x and 2.5.x.

Please read about the Colorset functionality and syntax in fvwm and
FvwmTheme man pages.

In 2.4.x you should run a special module FvwmTheme to work with
colorsets, in 2.5.x you don't need to do this. In both, you may use
"Colorset <n> options" syntax, rather than old "*FvwmTheme: Colorset <n>
options" syntax.

I hope you will be able to do what you want after reading the
documentation. You may also investigate fvwm-themes configurations (any
version), it is fully colorset based and has a lot of examples.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
Thank You for the previous help.
I made my fvwm desktop almost transparent ;-), but I couldn't find any 
theme that will make the titlebar transparent.
I have found a Cristal-Fvwm (a wm based on fltk), that uses the feature, 
but I would know whether can it be done in pure fvwm.
Thank You for the help & regards.

Do you mean like this (the screenshot is one year old):

It includes the instructions as well.

Hallo,
I have a little problem with my fvwm - my configuration looks like:
...
Colorset 40     Transparent, Tint Dark 20, Hi Grey25, Sh Grey25, Fore Black
Colorset 41     Transparent, Tint Cyan 15
Colorset 42     Transparent, Tint Red 15

Style *         HilightFore black, HilightBack #c3c3c3
Style *         ForeColor gray60, BackColor #c3c3c3
Style *         BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 1
Style *         MinOverlapPlacement, SloppyFocus

TitleStyle      LeftJustified
TitleStyle      Active Colorset 41 -- flat
TitleStyle      Inactive Colorset 42 -- flat

BorderStyle     Active Colorset 41 -- flat
BorderStyle     Inactive Colorset 42 -- flat
...
and the titlebar transparency doesn't work for my.
I have tried to comment the "Style" config without any result.
I'm using the cvs version of fvwm (2003.11.03).
The menu transparency works great.
Best regards.

You didn't copy correctly. Only RootTransparent works for decorations.
See the man page.

Here is a user reporting RM6 doing something similar (not launching)
with Exceed:

http://lists.q-linux.com/pipermail/plug/2002-December/023287.html

Here is one use with the same Exceed problem, then another with
your symptom with KDE:

http://dbforums.com/arch/128/2003/5/765501

(Looks like I put in my 2 cents on that one.)

This one is on a Sparc 20 and he reports font problems:

http://mailman.eng.auburn.edu/pipermail/ssa-managers/2003-February/005009.html

In some of  these cases, the user  reports that the icons don't launch
anything instead of  the main window  disappearing.  It could be
the same bug showing itself in another way.

The font symptom on the Sparc 20 is interesting.

I don't remember seeing any errors when I did my RM6 testing,
but you might want to double check and make sure you have no
errors being generated.

Nowhere did I see any of these problems being resolved.

Don't specify the size of the buttons.  I just have

  *FvwmButtonsGeometry 484x57+0-0
  *FvwmButtonsRows     5
  *FvwmButtonsColumns  60

FvwmButtons figures out the size of the individual buttons on its
own.  Internally, some buttons may be a couple of pixels higher or
wider than others to cover all the space.

Yes, with 2.5.x.

  *FvwmButtons: (Id mail, Title "no mail", Icon no_mail.xpm)
  SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeButton mail Icon new_mail.xpm, Title "new mail"

See the FvwmButtons man page for more details.

Hi there,

We start the first stage of logo competition  now.  Everyone
subscribed  to  one  of  the  fvwm  mailing  list or who has
submitted a logo for the competition should receive  a  mail
which contains a personal voting id which allows one to vote
for fvwm logos. This id is used to access the voting page.

The first voting stage ends at November 30.

Please vote for the logos in the fvwm logo competition and
help us to find the best logo for fvwm.

Cheers, Uwe

A transparent background for the pager rocks.  I couldn't find the 
instructions on how to get that going.  Can you point me in the right 
direction?  Do I need to be running 2.5.x to get that?

I don't know where I'd go about getting a different version of the
X server. I have tried patching it to the laterst rev. with no luck.

I don't know if you saw my followup email or not. I've tried several
different versions of fvwm 2.4.x, 2.3.x and until I went back to
2.0.46 they all had the same behavior.

I've been running 2.0.46 for two weeks now and it is perfect. Although
that doesn't exonerate the X server it at least would seem to give a clue
as to what may being tickled. 

The fact that under 2.4.x if I close a window and it disappears
from view but is never removed from the window list would seem to be
a large clue as to at least one aspect of the bad behavior. Since I
don't know how that is supposed to be managed I hoped (so far without
success) that someone aware of the internals could at least point me
to some code to look at and examine under the debugger so I'd have
some chance at understand what is happening.

  Nope, doesn't happen anymore.  Hmm...confusing.  I'm using the osx 
theme from fvwm-themes-extra-0.6.0.  My assumption is that there's a 
Style directive that's causing this, but I've looked through all my 
config files and can't figure out what's causing this.  Odd thing is 
that it doesn't happen to all Mozilla windows.  Just the main browser 
window and one other which I can't immediately recall.

Thanks for the advice.

It is not clear from your message whether you use fvwm-themes (and which
version) or just copied some configuration from it.

If you do use fvwm-themes, then run "fvwm-themes-config -e | grep ^Style
| less" from command line to see all style lines.

I guess there is something like:

  Style "FvwmButtons" NoTitle, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip

and your mozilla window happens to have the title named "FvwmButtons".
(This is only an example.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

If I understand you correctly, you want to create or suggest to create an
applet (for example using FvwmScript module) to handle email that may be
swallowed into FvwmButtons.

It is also possible to create a new fvwm module written in Perl that
manages FvwmButtons. For example, see module FvwmThemesPanelManager in
RedmondXP theme in fvwm-themes 0.7.0, it periodically updates date, time,
menus in the panel and manages different panel options using its menus.

Another solution is to use existing applets, like WindowMaker applets.
I think there are some applets to handle email.

If you find a good solution for your needs, tell us.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm running fvwm 2.5.7 and Gnome 2.4. I have fvwm setup as my window manager
and everything is fine until I run the gnome property editor
(nautilus preferences://).

That seems to takeover the desktop. Hotkeys still work, but menus and
FvwmBacker don't.

Is it me, or gnome, or fvwm, or...?

                                        Be seeing you,

It's Nautilus, it puts an invisible window on the background.
In the preferences editor, you can tell it not to.

I didn't see any errors.  The only thing I saw was the similar output to 
the truss command you had already posted.  In fact, other than a few 
small differences, it was the same.

Regarding the debian issue,
I just built CVS on Solaris 8 with no issues.

If you were doing a CVS build, maybe you skipped the
automake --add-missing && autoreconf
step?

I'm noticing something strange with 2.5.8 and gkrellm (2.1.21).

I click in the top area to move the window and go to move the mouse, but 
the window stays put.  After about 2 or 3 seconds, I hear a beep and the 
window all of a sudden appears under my pointer ready for me to place it 
anywhere.

If I use my hotkey to move it, I don't get the delay.

Is this a bug or maybe a compile option I missed?

A group is just different versions of the same logo.  It is *not*
the entirety of the logos on the author's page.  All the different
logos on the author's page have their own entry on the voting
sheet.

Uwe, can you add a statement to the voting page to clarify this?

gkrellm and fvwm are competing for a grab on the pointer.  The
beep indicates that fvwm has finally given up.  Make sure you don
not have any mouse bindings like

  Mouse 1 w ... Function ...

in your fvwm config.  And ask the gkrellm people to use the
method defined in the wm-spec aka EWMH spec to move their windows
rather that doing it on their own.  This would avoid the problem
altogether.

If you can't find the guilty lines, strip down your config file
systematically until the problem does not occur anymore.  Also,
you may use FvwmIdent to find out the name of the windows that do
not have a title.

I'm far from an expert on Gnome.
I've been in and out of it a couple of times.

On my version, I started nautilus, selected preferences, edit preferences,
selected windows and desktop, unselected Use Nautilus to draw the desktop,
clicked OK.

That option seems to have disappeared in Gnome 2.4.

Now the only way to stop nautilus taking over the entire desktop is to
use the gconf-editor. Under apps->nautilus->preferences uncheck the box
show_desktop. Or you start nautilus with the --no-desktop option,

Hallo,
Today I tried the OpaqueMoveSize and I noticed very strange behaviour.
On my old Virge GX the windows with OpaqueMoveSize 100% are refreshed 
after move (maybe because of the speed of the card).
On my new Radeon 9600 the windows are refreshed all the time, which 
cause very hard window moving.
Is there a option in fvwm to refresh window contents after move?
(such option is for example in sawfish).
Thank You for the help & regards.

It's the X server that refreshes the windows.  If you have XFree,
try enabling Backing Store with the +bs option to xinit.  If that
does not help, you try placing the feedback window during motion
in the top left screen corner with

  Emulate Mwm

or disable it altogether with

  HideGeometryWindow

n.b. This won't matter--Not only is a complex function needed to
properly move a window by clicking and dragging, but
EWMHActivateWindowFunc is called when you try to start dragging the
gkrellm window.

The only way I know of to get work around all this is to either call
Move in a context that it doesn't have a window (i.e. the cursor changes
and then you click and drag someplace on the gkrellm window), or to have
a move binding that captures the mouse before gkrellm has a chance (e.g.
I have mod3-mouse1 bound to a complex function that immediately runs
move.)  (The latter appears to be one thing the original poster
mentioned as working.)

You don't need to disable the Nautilus background, I don't think.

This is a quote from the fvwm man page, section "EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER
HINTS":

> There is a new Context 'D' for the Key, PointerKey, Mouse and Stroke
> commands. This context is for desktop applications (such as kdesktop and
> Nautilus desktop).

So, add "D" to your context for the commands you want enabled on the
desktop window and you should have no problems.

< gkrellm and fvwm are competing for a grab on the pointer.  The
< beep indicates that fvwm has finally given up.

speaking of beeping...

I get a beep whenever i hold down a mouse button (say, in a scrollbar)
for a long time.  I figured this was part of X and not fvwm.

Is it fvwm?
If so, how can i disable it (even if it requires recompiling)?

I'm on 257 on solaris 8.

Thanx

I do have a Function bound to Mouse 1.

Strange thing is though...it works fine with FVWM v2.4.17.

Any ideas on why that is?

I'm still trying to gain access to Solaris 9 but so far, no go.

I notice you say 2.4.x.  What version of Fvwm are you using?

You previously showed a stack trace from FvwmPager.
Can you print the variables being passed to XTextWidth?

Ah.  I was fearing that to vote for logos that i liked, is also

Much appreciate the clarification, Dominik.

When I start some (but not all) applications, they appear with
the edge of the application's window proper at 0,0 (upper left)
corner of the screen.  That is, the border and title bar is off
the screen.  I need to use the "Window Operation -> Move" to
re-adjust the position of the application so that the title bar
is visible.  I didn't see anything in the fvwm faq (or the
fvwm-themes faq) that describe this.  

Any suggestions as to what this phenomenon is, or how I can
'correct' it so that the applications start with the title bar
visible?

Which fvwm version?

Which applications and their window size hints (run "xwininfo -size")?

Which fvwm configuration (better run fvwm with no configuration)?

Mikhael.

(Darn.  I forgot to specify all of this on the original post)

  FVWM version 2.4.15
and
  fvwm-2.4.15-1
  fvwm-themes-0.6.2-1

> Which applications and their window size hints (run "xwininfo -size")?

xwininfo: Window id: 0x1c00029 "Pollo - /home/wendell/tmp/local.xml"
  Normal window size hints:
      Program supplied location: 0, 0
      Program supplied size: 788 by 570
      Program supplied window gravity: NorthWestGravity
  No zoom window size hints defined

It seems to be just java applications, and the "Program supplied
location: 0, 0" certainly looks bad.  Can I override this?

> Which fvwm configuration (better run fvwm with no configuration)?

Is this it?
  exec fvwm-themes-start
or is the configuration something else?

Theoretically, "Style * NoPPosition" should help. But this is the default
for fvwm-themes, so it is unclear. fvwm 2.5.x has more style options
like FixedPPosition and similar, this may help too.

It is also possible that 2.5.x behaves better regarding Java programs, I
can't say for sure. Maybe others have this Pollo application.

Define all additional style lines in file styles-extra as explained in
fvwm-themes FAQ.

Mikhael.

That sounds somewhat familiar.  I think you are right.  So the
problem can be circumvented by either destroying the corresponding
fvwm function:

  DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc

(which affects all windows, not just gkrellm).  Unfortunately, it
is not yet possible to disable certain features of the EWMH spec
for individual windows.

Because 2.4.x does not have EWMH hints support (see Ben's

Destroying this function would be undesirable for modern applications
asking the window manager to activate (bring to the user attention) their
windows.

A better solution would be to introduce Grab command and add "Grab off"
to EWMHActivateWindowFunc.

Ahh, OK.  I see.

Well, should we contact the gkrellm people to fix their application? 
Who would be best to do that and who is the proper person to contact? 
Any idea?

I.e. you say fvwm should know better than the user what to do and
disallow some legitimate functionality. I hope you have a better solution
in mind for this kind of problems regarding fvwm functions.

Like it or not, fvwm functions don't work reliably without the
grab.  Furthermore, they can not work reliably *because of the way
X11 is designed*.  Theoretically, one could improve predictability
of whether a particular function needs the grab or not, but
practically the code is so obscure that it it virtually impossible
to do so (partially since it depends on the behaviour of third
party software).

In the specific case the "Focus" command in EWMHActivateWindowFunc
is one of those that requires the grab to prevent a race condition
between the pointer being moved while the focus is changed.  If
the grab is not held in such a context, releasing the mouse button
leads to more or less random windows being focused (experience
from the past, not something I'm making up).

The situation can be improved by using the Schedule command to
trigger EWMHActivateWindowFunc or UrgencyFunc (plus any others?)
as soon as possible if the grab can not be established
immediately.  THe code handling scheduled functions should have
a similar check too and keep the functions due for execution in
the queue until a grab can be established.  However, it would be
necessary to always make the grab in the scheduler code since it's
impossible to predict whether the grab is necessary or not.

In this specific case yes.  How can the user know what's right

	If you upgrade to FVWM 2.5.x, you can try

"Style * FixedPPosition".

This was the only thing I found to help after Sun broke initial window
positioning worse than ever with the 1.4.1 release of Java.

	(I believe Sun's official label for this breakage was "a  fix". Sun
have been finding new ways to break initial positioning in Java since
the beginning of 1998, when bug 4102292 entered their Java bug database.
I haven't looked in about a year, but I'll bet it's still open - along
with about 50 others describing the same problem in slightly different
terms or with respect to different window managers. They just don't seem
to get it.)


Cheers,
Bob

Yes, it seems to be a Sun+Java 'feature'.  The bug database has
the bug marked as closed/fixed, but it isn't.   Other
workarounds ("AWTapp.geometry:  +70+70" in .Xdefaults and
"Style * FixedPPosition" in my own startup) don't seem to fix
it.  I guess we'll have to wait on Sun fixing java.

I upgraded to fvwm 2.5.8 from 2.5.7.

Now fvwm core dumps when I right click on the root window.

I made no other changes (to .fvwm2rc or otherwise).

Running on FreeBSD 4.8.

Who should I send a bug report to?  What should I send them?

This is a known problem with FreeBSD port. Try to compile 2.5.8 from
fvwm.org sources after reading the discussion on fvwm-workers list.

Also, please always start a new thread on a new topic, don't reply
to some unrelated thread.

Mikhael.

	I'll bet that elicited some choice comments from some of their
long-suffering users. Or perhaps they've just lost interest and given up
on Sun's obtuseness by now. I'll have to have a quick browse through the
database tomorrow.

	What release of Java are you using? I don't know how the widget
hierarchy is set up, but I did notice that AWTApp and VendorShell no
longer got used for the app's Class and Resource as of 1.4. Both Class
and Resource seem to take their name from the Java class name of the top
level window; e.g., say I have a simple app with a class called MyClass
that extends JFrame (it also happens to be the main() class, but I
don't think that matters), both the Class and Resource will be named
MyClass.

	Did you upgrade to FVWM 2.5.x? I seem to recall your saying that
you were running 2.4.15. FixedPPosition and some related styles were
only introduced in the 2.5 series.


Cheers,
Bob

Are you sure you don't have a module path set to a different version of
FVWM? Normally you shouldn't need to set it (the default path is compiled
in).
I think I've had this problem some time.

I can't reproduce this bug - what system are you using?
Does FvwmTabs output anything on stdout/stderr?

SCoTT. :)

Hi,

I am curious to know what the normal behaviour is in FVWM when an application
'docks' into the system tray, when there is no real system tray (only
FVWM is running) ?

And what should happen when there is an FvwmButtons running that
swallows an application which docks into the system tray. I get really
weird behaviour there: one time i was able to dock the application, and
to redraw it by unfolding the swallowing panel, but then redrawing was
really messed up, and interaction not really good working. Other times,
FvwmButtons seems to want to swallow it, but it can't, and a press on
the button times out. 

I had all these problems when enabling 'docking' in Psi, and i would like to 
know if it's due to Psi, due to FVWM, or due to the fact that it's just
not nice to dock applications when there is no real system tray and
that swallowing docking applications in panels is also a no-do.

cheers,
Remko

I really don't know what you mean with "docking" applications.
FvwmButtons handles everything about swallowing itself, and the
application should not even know about it.  I think GNOME and KDE
taskbars/panels define their own docking "protocol", but that is
not supported in any way by fvwm.  "Docking" suggests that the
application asks the container to swallow it, but that can not be
done with FvwmButtons.  You must reserve space for the application
in the FvwmButtons config.

Does that answer your questions?

Ciao

I thought it might be interesting to know that we received 152
voting sheets of the about 750 people that are allowed to vote
yet.  You can still make a difference by voting.  (I won't tell
any preliminary results though).

Hello,

i'm using the standard fvwmtabrc
(and a custom .fvwm2rc),
with fvwm 2.5.8 and fvwmtabs 2.4

when i restart fvwm (calling the Restart function)
fvwmtabs dies and does not give me back the xterms 
it had ! i can still view the process by doing
a ps aux, but they are not listed in my windowlist.

i have no clues how to grab them back.

FvwmTabs restarts fine (i can open a new tabber without starting the module)

here are the messages : (>comments)

Hi all,

What I'm trying to achive is a menu style where the only difference
between hilighted menu items on those not hilighted is a font shadow.
And I don't mean the fgsh color should change when a menu item is
hilighted but that the shadow should appear only when the item gets
hilighted so that the selected item "glows". This is my menu style so
far:

MenuStyle * HilightBackOff, Hilight3DOff, Animation, \
	PopupOffset 0 100, PopupDelay, PopdownDelay, SeparatorsLong, \
	TrianglesSolid, Font "shadow=1 all:xft:Blue Highway:size=16", \
	MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6

Colorset 5 TiledPixmap menu_back.xpm, fg grey90, bg rgb:29/5d/94
Colorset 6 fg white, fgsh rgb:29/5d/94

Since I can't specify different fonts (with and without shadow) for
active and inactive menu items I guess I will have to make the fgsh
color in Colorset 5 transparent. Is that possible or can it only be done
with a solid background color using this same color for fgsh in Colorset
5?

Cheers, Ben.

These errors are ok.

This is some rogue debug statement in FVWM - I don't know what it means.

These errors are ok too. It just means that some windows that were in
the tab-manager aren't around anymore. The problem is why those
windows disappeared on a simple restart.

Mmmm, yeah. This is the killer. What OS are you using? I just noticed I
get this problem on RH9 but everything is fine on my RH7.3 system.

: what did i do wrong ? 

Looks like a good old-fashioned BUG - I will look into it soon.

SCoTTie. :)

I've just upgraded from 2.5.7 to 2.5.8, in both cases rebuild from the
.src.rpm. 

Under 2.5.7 if I selected view->full screen in galeon, the window would
become the size of the screen and I would not get a title bar. Under
2.5.8 the window resizes, but the title bar remains. Worse, the
bottom of the window is now an equivelant amount below the bottom of the
screen.

I suspect this may be a galeon problem, as neither mozilla or opera
behave this way. My question: Is there a a workaround I can use to get
the old behaviour back? Upgrading galeon or switching to a different
browser are not options at the moment.

This is with galeon-1.2.10 on redhat 7.2 or redhat 9.


Thanks and regards,

Chris

Don't use 2.5.8 for now.  The window placement code is in flux
right now.

If you make it downloadable, then how about using release=xaview-2 or
similar? Because I would expect 2.5.9 (cvs) at this date.

> ii  libx11-protocol-perl    0.51.2-1         x11 protocol interface for perl

This package name looks bad to me. A better name would be
perl-x11-protocol (or even more correct, perl-X11-Protocol).

But then I also don't see a good reason for calling FvwmTabs fvwmtabs.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Xavier,

> |Looks like a good old-fashioned BUG - I will look into it soon.

I tracked this down to a bug in FVWM perllib last night. I sent a
patch to Mikhael, hopefully it will get applied soon.

> Is there a kick fix i could use to release all windows on all tabbers
> before fvwmtabs die ?

The 'ReleaseAll' menu-item (or associated key-binding, Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R
I think).

Alternatively you can apply the patch I sent to the fvwm-workers list
yourself.

SCoTT. :)

My .FVWM-errors does only show:
Use of uninitialized value in string eq at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/X11/Auth.pm line 97.
Argument "XCMiscGetVersion" isn't numeric in int at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/X11/Protocol.pm line 2028.
FvwmTabs: Couldn't create D&D icon from /usr/share/icons/mini/mini-happy.xpmFvwmTabs: Reading state from /tmp/.fvwmtabs.state
Module FvwmTabs started with X11::Protocol version 0.51_2.
-------

I am using gentoo with x11-wm/fvwm-2.5.7-r3 package. 

My config does use multible desktops with only one window
"DeskTopSize 1x1"
and do switch between them with 
"
Key 1 A M GotoDesk 0 0
Key 2 A M GotoDesk 0 1
Key 3 A M GotoDesk 0 2
" bindings. By using these the fvwmtabs does not (only seldom?!)
regain focus.
Its working with aterms without using fvwmtabs. Or with old v2.1 .

I have put my .fvwm dir to download at 
http://www.ownz.de/medlor-fvwm.tar.gz . Perhaps this does help you.

You are welcome to send patches that improve the deb package we provide.
However if you speak about hooks and other ancient things, I see them as
a clear deterioration. This will not be applied. The configuration in
your patch are so ancient (from 5-7 years ago?) that it makes no sence to
start to fix it. It should be dropped. We already provide 2 sets of
configurations for a user without any fvwm2rc. Maintaining more
configurations that are also distribution specific is meaningless.

We also don't add any distribution specific legacy things to our rpms.
The binary packages from developers are clean and include only the things
installed on a regular "make install". With addition of all mandatory
stuff to pass the package requirements and minor usability things.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

when i resize an xterm which is not tabbed,
the xterm force me to resize to a size which
will permit the perfect display of each chars..

within a tabber, i can resize my xterm to anything i want,
so it's often not perfect, i can easily get borders 
"cropped" by the fvwmtab window.

is there a way to use the resize attributes of the underlying
xterm when i resize my tabber window ?

thanks

Hello,











Hello,
I have an issue that my middle mouse button does not paste properly when 
using any of the 2.5.x series of fvwm.  I can paste using the middle 
mouse button from xterm to xterm but not from other programs i have 
found,  e.g. from mozilla to xterm.  I can also copy and paste for apps 
that have pull down menus, e.g. from mozilla to a gnome-terminal or open 
office. Everything worked great in fvwm 2.4.x  Is there a way to fix this? 

Here are my mouse bindings.
Thanks,
Paul

	Are we still speaking of the examples? 

	I note that the packages provided do not integrate well into
 Debian's menu system, nor do they integrate with the alternatives
 system; and, off hand, I do not see a system wide default fvwmrc. Are
 these the legacy things you refer to? If so, I am afraid that the
 packages provided by Debian must remain diverged; some of these are
 required by the need to present an consistent integration of window
 managers into Debian.

 try and see if I can get him to cede the apckage to me, when I'll
 have greater control over the default configuration.

I think this is a problem with mozilla (1.4 here).  I can confirm
the problem, but evidence suggests that it is indeed mozilla which
sometimes does not copy the selected text to the clipboard.  It
always works if I select Edit->Copy from mozilla's menu (or press
Ctrl-C).  Furthermore, when it fails to work, pasting always
inserts the previous selection, so I know that pasting does work.
I don't see how fvwm could prevent mozilla from copying the
selected text to the clipboard.

Ciao

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:
- Can now use regular expressions when specifying auto-swallow windows.
- New window tabizer dialog for dynamically specifying which windows to swallow.
  (Includes regex matcher.)
- bugfix: strange behaviour after restarts.
- bugfix: release-&-iconify was occasionally invoking a pick operation.
- Note: This version requires the latest version of X11::Protocol (v0.52).
- Note: There is a bug in perllib in FVWM 2.5.8 which can cause FvwmTabs to
  behave strangely during restarts. It has been fixed in FVWM's CVS tree as
  of 20031112.

Note for Xavier & Tavis making FvwmTabs distributions:
My patch to X11::Protocol v0.51 (which was bundled in my own distro
v0.51_2) has been merged into v0.52 so this should be considered the
definitive version of X11::Protocol to use from now on.

SCoTT. :)

I am speaking about the patch of 1.2Mb that you apply.

It would be acceptable if you apply a patch of 500b, but at this point
you just package something else, not what we release.

Try the latest cvs, I think this is all handled at the needed minimum.

fvwm is best to be run without any system wide fvwmrc, especially the one
written 5-7 years ago. The users then gets a menu and a choice to setup
2 configurations we maintain. There is also the third choice, fvwm-themes.

To do it propertly, I would package fvwm-legacy that could be installed
by the users who need it on top of the clean deb (most of the users do
not need this additional package).

I don't really worry about any specific distribution and their internal
politics, the only thing I worry is to get much less distribution specific
questions/problems on this list.

You may force this if you replace X11::Protocol in the module with:

  X11::Protocol>=0.52

Thanks Scott, if anyone using Gentoo would like to try the update, you
can do this:

// fetch the latest updates to the portage tree
# emerge sync

// you need to accept packages marked ~arch (testing), use this command 
// to check everything looks okay and you have all the USE flags set you
// want (you need perl and tcltk set to get FvwmTabs).
# ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86 emerge -pv fvwm
(...)
[ebuild   U   ] dev-perl/X11-Protocol-0.52 [0.51-r2] 
[ebuild   U   ] x11-wm/fvwm-2.5.8-r1 [2.5.8] +readline +truetype +ncurses +gtk +stroke -gnome -rplay -xinerama +perl -nls +png -bidi +imlib +tcltk +debug +gtk2

// if that looks okay...

Maybe a good way forward would be for someone to go through the 1.2M
patch and give a concise bullet list of all the changes that it makes.

Then we can have a bullet-by-bullet discussion about whether each is
appropriate or not, in the new FVWM.  It seems that the FVWM Debian
package is suffering from some bitrot, where the Debian-specific parts
haven't always been modified to reflect enhancements in the base
package.

As an example I agree with Mikhael that there shouldn't be a system-wide
default fvwm config: Dan's excellent work to bring up a configurator for
new FVWM users shouldn't be hidden by years-old crusty configuration
files.


Let's get the list of changes, then we can all decide how to create the
best possible package for both Debian users and FVWM developers.


I've had a lot of good experiences with Manoj as the Debian maintainer
of GNU make so I feel confident we can work together just as amicably
for FVWM.  For DEBs, even moreso than with RPMs, I don't think it's a
good idea to have two very different setups: it just doesn't make sense
in the Debian world.  If we can get the "official" DEB setup, or very
close to it, into the FVWM release tarball that would be most excellent.


Should we move this discussion to the fvwm-workers list?

When I invoke open office 1.1 swriter, it opens as shaded. I don't
specify shaded window anywhere in config files. I don't even have shaded
command in my menus. I have to issue "windowshade false" from
FvwmConsole to open it up. It only happens on swriter but not other
programs in open office or anything else.

Does anybody have any idea?

How does the 'Swallow' operation work?  I've tried to replace
the stock xlcock with that one with the fish in it (wmfishtime),
but the wmfishtime always starts on the desktop with borders
(not in the FvwmButtons window).  I've tried various
combinations of geometry and Hints/NoHints, with no success.
Any suggestions?  (The bubblemon-dockapp-1.41 also works this
way, starting on the desktop rather than being swallowed).

#---------- attempt to replace xclock...

*FvwmButtons: (Frame 2, \
        Swallow "wmfishtime" `Exec exec wmfishtime -b  \
        -padding 1 -update 1`)

#---------- original xclock...
#*FvwmButtons: (Frame 2, \
#        Swallow(NoHints) "xclock" `Exec exec xclock -geometry
#        +5000+5000 \

It doesn't make any difference.

Hello,
Thanks for the reply Dominik.
Unfortunatey it is not just mozilla  I can not use the middle mouse 
button to paste to Gvim, glade, open office,  gnome-terminal etc.  I am 
hoping it is a setting I am using.  I did try unbind strokes to see if 
that was the issue but the behavior was the same.

(I have mail problems, so it is possible someone already answered.)

wmfishtime sets the name "fishmon", not "wmfishtime" that you use above,
this is why it is not swallowed. Use FvwmIdent module or xwininfo from
shell to read the window names.

Mikhael.

Hello,
I figured it out - when I have strokes defined then the pasting 
operation does not work properly - having e.g this will break it:

Stroke 852    2       A    N       Exec exec xterm -fg white -bg black &


I can live without strokes - but they are nice.

Cheers!
Paul

Try

  Style OpenOffice* GNOMEIgnoreHints
  Style OpenOffice* EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints
  Style OpenOffice* EWMHIgnoreStateHints
  Style OpenOffice* EWMHIgnoreStrutHints
  Style OpenOffice* NoPPosition
  Style OpenOffice* NoUsposition 
  Style OpenOffice* FixedPPosition

(probably a subset will do).

With this binding you ask explicitely for your mouse 2 to stop to work in
applications. Do not configure it "A"nywhere.

Here is a better example (a small piece from fvwm-themes):

  # mouse 3 with no modifier on the root window
  Mouse   3       R       A       StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2

  # mouse 3 with Alt on a window
  Mouse   3       WD      M       StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2

  # A | from the top to the bottom
  Stroke  N852    0       R       A       FuncFvwmTerminal
  Stroke  N852    0       WD      M       FuncFvwmTerminal

  # A | from the bottom to the top
  Stroke  N258    0       R       A       FuncFvwmEditor
  Stroke  N258    0       WD      M       FuncFvwmEditor

Thanks, Dominik!
'Style OpenOffice* EWMHIgnoreStateHints' did it. 

What file does open office get these EWMH hints?
I looked at some documents in http://www.freedesktop.org/ site,
but I can't find anything like user's manual type material.

It's probably hard coded into the open office libraries.

I'm running 1.1 and it is not doing that.

To see if it is somewhere in your configuration, you could rename
$HOME/OpenOffice.org1.1.0
and start swriter again.

I think it will go thru setup, but you should find out if it is something
in your settings or in OpenOffice.

Hello, this is my first email to the list. I installed fvwm2 just
yersterday, and I really excited on starting to configure my .fvwm2rc.
How ever I cant find any docs explaining the syntaxis and commands to
configure it well. Could anyone give me a URL where I can find one (or
more)?? And yes, I know that the man page explains some of these.

thanks
Dave

Nice bg piccie! :)

Well I'm using your exact FVWM configuration on my system & I can't
reproduce this bug. (focusing works fine after switching desktops.)

I'm using:
Redhat Linux 7.3
fvwm 2.5.9 (from cvs) compiled on Nov 11 2003
FvwmTabs v2.5
Module FvwmTabs started with: X11::Protocol 0.52, Tk 800.024.

SCoTTie. :)

And here is my first mail to the list...I also found it hard to dig the 
man pages, their just overwhelming, at the gentoo forums is a thread 
handling different aspects with examples, have a look for a start, after 
that it will get easier to find your way through the official 
documentation (hopefully... :-)

http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=80517&sid=3f9abef4e7ce16907024da643bad2e5a

Some of the screenshots at fvwm.org come with configurations, be sure to 
check these, also this site was of use to me:

http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm-decors.html

If there exists an 'Idiot's Guide to FVWM' I'd love to hear about it, 
but looking at other people's configs does really help a lot.

Have fun,

What a ode to fvwm, what an advocacy and zealotry. :) Amazing. :)

There are even many questions answered correctly. Direct all unanswered
questions to this and fvwm-themes lists (after reading FAQ of course).

Hello folks,

I want to modify the redmond98 theme for my needs, e.g. increasing
number of workspaces, switch off the button bar and such things.

Is it possible that I do not have to modify the theme directly,
'cause I am afraid of updateing the theme then.

Is it possible that I can write down my modifications in
~/.fvwm/..., so an update dos not interfere my configuration?

I already use ~/.fvwm/themes/personal for starting programs on
different screens and so on...


Greets,
Tom

Create a directory for your tomas_redmond98 theme (or just tomas) and
place the components you want to modify into it.

You may read about how to create your own themes in the documentation
supplied with fvwm-themes. It is just copy file/dir, modify, refresh.

If you still have problems, ask on fvwm-themes-users list.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello Mikhael and others, 

curently I am fighting with my ADSL-Connection and I am in 
creation of a CyberCenter in Strasbourg (Internet-Cafe, 
Formation Center, ISP)...

For the 'Formation Center' I am writing curently a full blown 
Documentation in severav Volumes...

Volume 3 is about the X Window System and fvwm2 which I mean, 
is the best Window-Manager of all availlables... (Using since
03/1999)

The Documentation is curently not complet, but it will be 
availlable on my own Website. (if my ADSL is running, - grrrr)

Volunteers which like to help me to translate the Documentation 
in Languages other then german (my native), englich and french 
are welcome, (proofreaders too).

Please note, that The Documentation is based on Debian GNU/Linux
3.0r1 WOODY. 

Current Adress:

Michelle Konzack
Apt. 917
50, rue de Soultz
67100 Strasbourg
France

For those which are in the near of Strasbourg:

You can find me today at a Linux Install-Party between 9:30 - 11:30
and 15:00 and 19:00. The Link is:

    <http://strasbourg.linuxfr.org/>

Thanks
Michelle Konzack

A discussion about xserver has been running on the message boards for
Gentoo distro and it seems quite
intersting...http://xserver.freedesktop.org/

I was curious what fvwm's actuall requirements are for building....

from what I can tell, fvwm looks like it will be compliant and able to
run on this server as others have been using other wm's but I think most
people already have Xfree86 already built.

Curious,  

Cat

Hi friends,

I've got two questions and would be pleased if somebody could tell me
right commands:

(1) How do I configure *all* popup sub menus to appear *next to* the
root window on the right and not covering it to the half?

(2) How do I set the color of that outer part of the window border which
appears if the border is not configured as flat but rised?

Thanks!!
 Felix

MenuStyle * PopupOffset -3 100

You should be more specific, in the previous question you used the word
"window" to mean "menu", do you speak here about menus or windows?

Anyway, border color in the raised (3d-like) look is configured using
colorset attributes: shadow and hilight. You should use colorsets to
define all your colors (menus, windows, modules). Something like:

  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6, GreyedColorset 7

  Colorset 5 fg blue4, bg grey77, hi grey90, sh grey57, Plain, NoShape

You may save time of reading documentation if you take a look at examples
of different configuration parts used in fvwm-themes.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

A very minor release.

ChangeLog:
- Performance improvement - explicit sync with X server no longer required.
- Adheres to gridded resizing modes.

SCoTT. :)

Can anyone think of a way to restore a window's Icon after changing it,
or is there a way of getting that information from within an function?

I'm writing a simple Eye-Candy function, like this:

ExecUseShell /bin/ksh

DestroyFunc IconifyWithScreenshot
AddToFunc IconifyWithScreenshot
+ I Raise
+ I PipeRead "import -window $[w.id] -frame -silent -quality 0 $[HOME]/.fvwm/tmp.$[w.id].png \
	&& convert -resize 64 -frame 1x1 -bordercolor white -quality 0 \
		png:$[HOME]/.fvwm/tmp.$[w.id].png png:$[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png \
	&& echo WindowStyle IconOverride, Icon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png \
	|| echo Nop"
+ I Iconify
+ I Schedule 1000 Exec rm $[HOME]/.fvwm/?(icon|tmp)*.png

example:

before: 
http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/step1.png

after: 
http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/step2.png

After removing the icons, I'd like to restore it to it's original Icon,
so that if I Iconify the window without using this function, it doesnt
just dissapear. Maybe theres a better way?

You can't push/pop Icon files for a window, only one icon is stored.
Hovewer you may do DestroyWindowStyle on deiconify if this helps.

You may also listen to destroy_window packet and then remove the icons,
not immediately after one second.

I would use "import -geometry 64 -resize 64 -silent" without additional
convert and use *IconTitle* and *IconBackground* style options instead.
Should be faster.

Mikhael.

Yep, I was planning on doing that, just wanted to get it working nicely

It would be really nice if we had an additional parameter to DestroyStyle
and DestroyWindowStyle to destroy only one specific style option, not all
style entry options. This would allow a lot of new dynamical functionality.
In your case you destroy all window-specific changes, not just Icon.

Please do not do it like this. The last 9 lines should be:

  DestroyFunc DeIconifyWithScreenshot
  AddToFunc DeIconifyWithScreenshot
  + I DestroyWindowStyle
  + I Exec rm -f $HOME/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-IconWatch: *
  *FvwmEvent-IconWatch: deiconify DeIconifyWithScreenshot

Or to eliminate Exec call, even use: Test (f file) Exec exec rm file.

On another topic, reading the Gentoo forum, it seems that Gentoo package
of fvwm-themes is both old (0.6.2) and does not work with fvwm 2.5.x (how
is this possible?). This should be fixed by Gentoo people, I guess.

Regards,
Mikhael.

That would be very cool, as WindowStyle is a brand new feature I havnt
had a chance to do much else with it, so its working for me right now :)

Hello,

Excuse me for butting in, but I thought I'd give this idea a go. When I 
try and use the function I get the following output on the console:

import: Unable to read X window image (0x60000e).
import: Missing an image filename.

(With a different window number for different windows, obviously)

Insertion of an extra echo shows that the line that is failing is:
  PipeRead "import -geometry 64 -frame -resize 64 -silent -window 
0x60000e /home/ara/.fvwm/icon.tmp.0x60000e.png + I echo WindowStyle 
IconOverride, Icon /home/ara/.fvwm/icon.tmp.0x60000e.png || echo Nop"

Any ideas? This is with 2.5.8.

Also, I had to comment out the bottom + I Iconify, otherwise I get a 
kind of 'bouncing' effect, where the window iconises and then 
immediately deiconises. This could be because the former command is 
failing though AFAIK.
Cheers,

Andy

Hi everybody, I was wondering if fvwm is customizable enough to create
some sort of thing described below, or maybe some sort of thing already
exists. I am looking to create some sort of console/terminal that
automaticly pops up over any existing windows when some important
messages popup. And dissapears automaticly after X seconds.

I would like to redirect multiple logfiles to that console and specify
when the console should popup, maybe by flagging a logfile or/and specify
patterns to recognize in the actual log when it should popup..

Any help would be appreciated ..

Thx 
-Boy

You probably didn't copy it correctly. The "+ I" should be "&&".

It should not bounce, even if PipeRead failed.

Post the whole related config you use, i.e. FvwmEvent lines, the
mentioned function lines and so on.

I see several solutions. Passive periodical checking (may be done using
Schedule, it is even good that Schedule does not work when you are away
from your X in this case). Or active checking, you run FvwmCommandS
module from StartFunction. And run a filter program that executes
shell command "FvwmCommand 'ActivateLogWindow'" when needed. This
ActivateLogWindow function may execute "Schedule X000 DeactivateLogWindow".

Chack out FAQ (the search keyword "Toggle") and the man pages with all
mentioned keywords.

Mikhael.

Thx for the suggestions, so there are no existing implementations of
this functionality. I think I will go for the active solution.

Thx for the help ...

Dear all,

my fvwm configuration is as described above:
- 4 Desks, organized 1x4
- 2 DeskTops per Desk, organized 1x2

I managed to configure

Key   Up    A M Scroll +0 -100
Key   Down  A M Scroll +0 +100

such that I can press <alt-up> or <alt-down> to switch between the
DeskTops.

However, is there any way that I can configure a key-binding to switch
between the desks?

If possible, I would like to have <alt-Up> to switch the Desk one
Desk upwards if I am already on the upper Desktop, Otherwise, I would
be more than fine if I could bind <alt-PgDown> to switch the Desks
downwards, respectively <alt-PgUp> the other way round...

Gruss,
Lukas

What you call "DeskTop" we call "page" or "virtual page".

Hello,
I'm trying to set up some sort of panel similar to those used by
certain desktop environments with several icons which are used to
launch applications. The problem is that I do not want a frame
around each button but still would like to get some kind of
visual feedback when the button is clicked on.
Any ideas how this could be accomplished with FvwmButtons or
FvwmScript?
I'm using fvwm 2.5.8.

Hello Scott

Finaly i got time to briefly look into the code.
I found the error at takeFocus():
----------
<...>
    else
    {
        $winId = $tabWin{$tId}{tab}[$tabWin{$tId}{currentTab}]{winId};
    }
    # "revert-to" (2nd) arg can be 'Parent', 'PointerRoot' or 'None'.
    $xServer->SetInputFocus($winId, 'Parent', $tabWin{$tId}{focusTimestamp}); 
    # $fvwm->debug("takeFocus(end) winId=$winId");
<...>
----------

Changing the SetInputFocus() to 
"$xServer->SetInputFocus($winId, 'Parent', 'CurrentTime');"
its all working flawless.

The variables in $tabWin{$tId}{focusTimestamp} does look ok though, but
i dont have any knowledge about the X11-Protocol. Perhaps you know
what could be wrong.

Hopefully i could help you finding the bug.

Greets
Tobias

I am trying to configure my fvwm (2.5.8) to automatically start certain
apps when I start X and fvwm (using the startx command). With the setup
I've listed below, only the first app (sylpheed) starts, and once it's
started it refuses to respond to any mouse clicks. None of the other
apps start. Does anyone know where I've gone wrong?

I start fvwm from .xinitrc using startx. The relevant line is :

exec fvwm &>fvwm.out 2>&1

The relevant lines from .fvwm2rc are :

# 1 desktop with 16 pages
DeskTopSize 4x4

# New config to auto-start apps
DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Function ExecSylpheed
 + I Function ExecKonsole
 + I Function ExecGkrellm
 + I Function ExecXmms

AddToFunc ExecOnPage            I GotoPage $1 $2
+                               I Exec exec $0
+                               I Wait $0

AddToFunc ExecSylpheed          I ExecOnPage "sylpheed-claws" 0 1

AddToFunc ExecKonsole           I ExecOnPage "konsole" 2 0
+                               I ExecOnPage "konsole" 3 0

AddToFunc ExecGkrellm           I ExecOnPage "gkrellm" 1 1

AddToFunc ExecXmms              I ExecOnPage "xmms" 1 1

Thanks!

Fvwm is hanging in the "Wait" command.  Since you say only the
first app starts correctly, it must be the "konsole" that does
not start properly.  Using "Wait" is always a dangerous thing.
If you just want to start the apps on a different page you can
also try to set their position via X resources or the command line,
e.g.

  xterm -g +<displaywidth>+0

to place an xterm in the top left corner of page 1 0.  This way,
you can do without the "Wait".  Also, if you want *all* instances
of the program appear on the same page, try

  Style sylpheed-claws StartsOnPage 0 1, SkipMapping

(SkipMapping tells fvwm not to switch to that page when the window
appears).

     I am a student for math sience. Have a money shortage. I  
     hope to get a job in the university Computer Help Desk Unit. 
     In the Joining Test I got UNIX mission : Install a fwnd   
     software in my Unix account , customize it , and add a search path.

   The Problem :
     When I write fwnd in my account and press enter a
     message appear: "fwnd session is already on"

I don't know anything about "fwnd" (you used this word 4 times, so it
does not seem to be a typo). This mailing list is about "fvwm".

I am not really sure what is better, to help you, or to help poor students
to get a good Unix consultant/admin. I mean, this is your test, I hope you
will pass it successfully. Try to read documentation and search in Google.

You are welcome to ask any specific fvwm related (but not Unix related)
question on this list after reading the documentation. Include the exact
technical information, at least your environement and the version you try
to compile or run, otherwise we will not be able to help.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

is it possible to force dialogs to pop up near or on its
parents? I could not found anything in the documentation.
Maybe I missed a capable module.

Thanks

	Carsten

Hello, and as usual thanks for replying Mikhael ;)

Apologies about the incorrect line. It was correct to start with, but
probably got mucked up at some point when I was trying to work out the
problem. I have corrected it, but still get the original problem,
complete with the above error message and 'bouncing'.

Is it possible that I have an incorrect version of import? I have:
ara@zoidberg ara $ import -version
Version: ImageMagick 5.5.6 04/01/03 Q16 http://www.imagemagick.org

Here are the relevant config lines: (winname_event included just so you
can see how it fits in in the FvwmEvent config)
(.fvwm/Functions)

#ExecUseShell /bin/ksh
DestroyFunc IconifyWithScreenshot
AddToFunc IconifyWithScreenshot
+ I echo "Iconnify running"
+ I Raise
+ I PipeRead "import -geometry 64 -frame -resize 64 -silent -window
$[w.id] $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png \
&& echo WindowStyle IconOverride, Icon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png \
|| echo Nop"
+ I Iconify

DestroyFunc DeIconifyWithScreenshot
AddToFunc DeIconifyWithScreenshot
+ I echo "deIconnify running"
+ I DestroyWindowStyle
#+ I Test (f file) Exec exec rm -f $HOME/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].png


DestroyFunc winame_event
AddToFunc winame_event
   + I ThisWindow ("*ara*") Style "*ara*" Colorset 1
   + I ThisWindow ("*root*") Style "*root*" Colorset 2

(.fvwm/Modules)

*FvwmEvent: StartDelay 3
#*FvwmEvent: Delay 1
#*FvwmEvent: startup          "/usr/local/share/sounds/fvwm/gong.au"
*FvwmEvent: window_name winame_event
*FvwmEvent: deiconify DeIconifyWithScreenshot
*FvwmEvent: iconify IconifyWithScreenshot
Module FvwmEvent


I get the "(de)iconify running" messages at the console, so the event
part of the config is working. I did wonder if the inability to read the
Xwindow image might be a permissions problem, in the same way that some
of the nodes in /dev can cause problems with OpenGL, but running:

# import -geometry 64 -frame -resize 64 -silent -window 0x2400019
~~/test.png && echo WindowStyle IconOverride, Icon ~/test.png

At the console as both root and my normal user works fine.

Thanks,

Andy

I'm having trouble getting transparent titlebars and menus working on my
system.

I've searched through the list archive and tried the examples provided,
but none work for me.

I've also tried searching Google for examples.

Could someone please send me an .fvwm2rc that creates transparent
titlebars and/or menus?

I would greatly appreciate it!

I'm running FVWM 2.5.8.

Mark
