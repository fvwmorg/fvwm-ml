Yes, because I used a phrase like "click on a mouse" which should have
been a "window".

Let's say I have a window B which is half hidden behind a window A. I move
the mouse into window B and then focus changes to window B. Cool. Now I
want to raise window B. Under MWM I could click anywhere within window B
and it would be raised (and the click passed to application). Under FVWM
(95, v2.0.42) I must click on the border or on the title for the window to
raise. I use SloppyFocus which I like very much. I don't want
ClickToFocus. ANy help?

Tried it, been there, seen 'em all. No help. I even considered changing
FvwmAuto so it would do what I want but apparantly Modules are not
notified on clicks within the window.

I also tried "Mouse 1 W A Raise" but then a click would raise the window
but not allow for the click to arrive the underlying program (within the
window).

OK, Here's one example window, which is used for my local workstation
called 'cream'.
Identify command says:
		Name: [cream]
		Icon Name: [cream]
		Class: XTerm
		Resource: xterm

At the FvwmTalk window I type:   Style "[cream]" color green/yellow
and then do "recapture". Nothing happens. If I do "XTerm" instead of
"[cream]" it works. I want to assign different colors to the title bars,
and differet mini-icons according to the window name.

I think the "-name" option to XTREM does the trick. Unfortunately I'm late
to be somewhere so I'll have to check it later. The script I'm using today
sents (as far as I can tell by checking the source) only -T (and -fg, -bg)

PS: I have to admit it's been a long while since I last replied such a
thorough and polite answer to a list query. Way To Go.

I have had the same problem. Ths closest I could get was:

# In the Window the modifier key (usually alt or diamond) does a raise.
#     Button    Context Modifi  Function
Mouse 1         W       M       Raise

I did not know MWM worked the way you described. I myself use Win95 from
home with Xwin32, and Xmouse, where I am used to similar behaviour. 

Howver if anyone knows how to get a single mouse click in a window area to
raise the window, without loosing the "cut (from cut and paste)
functionality, I would be grateful.

Hi!
	I would like to execute a function ( e.g. GoToPage ) by clicking
on an icon from Goodstuff. Could you please tell me the correct

The functionality exists in the SmartPlacement code to do "weighting" of
window importance.  It already does this for StaysOnTop windows, but
currently not for any other types of windows.  The problem is how to
communicate the desired weighting to the SmartPlacement function.  It
would seem that a new Style flag would have to be added, which I don't
know if Chuck would want to include at this point.  I think this type of
thing might need to wait until after the Great Style Flag Rewrite.  So
currently to get this type of functionality you would have to hard code it
into SmartPlacement.  (Which isn't as hard as it might sound.  It only
requires one line of code (per weighting)).

this is great when I press the left shift key the computer will back space
for me! great! well I read a message about keymaps and stuff and it showed
that keymap 50 = BackSpace but it looks like it maped my left shift key,
how do I set it up so that I can use the backspace key in Netscape and in
tkgoodstuff?

and for my second question how do I get the autoraise and auto focus
functions to work? 

what the heck and for my third and final question why does the cut and
past function not work? I can not use the shift-insert to past some text.

AFAIK it's keymap 22. Someone correct me if I'm wrong... :)

Add this to .fvwm2rc. It'll raise windows 500 milliseconds after they got 
focus.

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+               "I" Module FvwmAuto 500

Use the following to give focus to windows the mouse is in, it won't
un-focus when you get above the desktop.

Style "*" SloppyFocus

I always cut/paste by selecting text with the first mouse-button and
pasting it with the second/middle button. BTW: That is COPY/paste. I
wouldn't know how to do CUT/paste.

I like exmh. This is a tcl/tk program that sits on top of the mh mail
utilites. Therefore, there is more to setting things up when compared to
openwindows mailtool. You have to install tcl/tk and the mh utilities, but
I believe that its worth it.

get exmh from ftp.sunlabs.com or http://www.sunlabs.com/~bwelch/exmh/index.html
get tcl/tk from http://www.sun.com/960710/cover/dltcl.html
get mh from ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/mh

I like exmh too, but is there any way to change editors in it?  I prefer a 
"vi" like editor.  Pine lets you switch among different editors.

This version by default now excludes stickies unless you specify -s
(before it didn't, i.e. the confusion).  I just put a version 0.9
(code date 29/11/96) which also includes some man page fixes.  Note
the -sizeup option for FvwmCascade was changed to -resize in this
version.

I have seen a really cool one called asmail, that utilizes tkrat, which
requires the tcl/tk scripting languages installed... but I have not yet
tried it. Does anyone know where it is located???

The address for asmail is http://www.rby.hk-r.se/~pt95pli/asmail.html
I also recomment the module Wharf of Afterstep. Wharf works as Goodstuff
but it has more features such as you can creat a button which will draw
out some other buttons if you press it and the buttons will draw back
after you click it again. Wharf can be used in fvwm like a module as
Goodstuff.

Speaking of exmh, has anyone ever noticed the strange behavior interaction
between exmh and fvwm?  Specifically when a note with an X-Url tag arrives,
exmh puts a small "URL" button next to the face display.  When I move to
the NEXT message and the "URL" button goes away, the exmh window suddenly
changes positions!  Sometimes the title bar is moved completely off the
screen.  It is quite annoying.  I was wondering if anyone could explain
this?

  I am using exmh 1.6.5 and fvwm 2.0 pl 35 on an RS/6000 running AIX 4.1.4.

  Thanks!

    ...Lance

Hi Thomas,

I believe I have found a bug in FvwmForm wrt selection colours (this
MAY be a general fvwm2 bug, so I have cc'ed this message to the fvwm
mail address..).

I use to following code to get a verify form when I quit fvwm2

Style QuitVerify NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 7
*QuitVerifyGrabServer
*QuitVerifyWarpPointer
*QuitVerifyFore         Black
*QuitVerifyBack         grey65
*QuitVerifyFont         *helvetica*m*r*n*18*
*QuitVerifyButtonFont   *helvetica*m*r*n*18*
*QuitVerifyItemFore     Black
*QuitVerifyItemBack     grey75
*QuitVerifyCommand      Beep
*QuitVerifyLine         center
*QuitVerifyText         "Do you really want to logout?"
*QuitVerifyLine         expand
*QuitVerifyButton       quit    "Yes"   ^M
*QuitVerifyCommand      Quit
*QuitVerifyButton       quit    "Cancel"        ^[
*QuitVerifyCommand      Nop

The colours work fine when running (fvwm2.0.42) on Solaris with 8 bit
displays. I run the same setup on my LinuxBox (S3 Trio64+ videocard) 
and again it works correctly with 8 bit colour. But when I run at
16 bit (the usual) the popup form is only black and white. Quite
disappointing!

Any suggestions?

Cheers
Chris Phillips

Known problem, will be fixed in 2.0.44 (due out in the next week or so
with any luck).  The fix was submitted by Chris Laas, and I believe if
you search the fvwm mailing list archives (see the official web site)
you'll find the patch there and can try it.

Chuck

I've released new versions of the FvwmCascade and FvwmTile modules.
The major changes are config file entries (lower precedence than
command-line args) and fvwm version *1* support (limited, since fvwm1
does not support decent module arguments, so you have to use the rc
file).

Since fvwm version 1 is supported, it may or may not work with
derivatives of that.

Due to these new additions, I've to wait and see any last problems or
fixes or minor additions before I release it as a 1.0.

They can be found at:
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_modules.html

Regards,
Andrew

I'm no expert here, but perhaps you'd have better luck
with the latest stable exmh version, 1.6.9.

A quick web search should point you to the site.
Search on exmh and Brent Welsch.

jamie 

p.s.  The installation is pretty painless.

  I have now tried the latest fvwm and the latest exmh (1.6.9) and the
problem still exists.  However, during the course of testing, I found that
it only happens when I specify the geometry on the command line:

exmh -geom 920x970-165-10 &

  If I let the geometry default, I do not get this odd behavior.

  I have not yet tried this with other window managers to see if I get
the same results, but I will and I'll let you know what the outcome is.

  Okay, it's been a good day!

  I should have read the following from my .exmh-defaults-color file (even
though it's not that clear about what the bug is):

! To avoid a resizing bug in TK, do not specify geometry resources
! for the toplevel windows.  Instead, use "position", which
! exmh groks.  The bug is that you cannot specify a geometry like
! +10-40 for a toplevel frame (frame creation barfs), and if you
! specify a width and height, it has to be in pixels (because the
! gridded text subwindow isn't created yet) and you don't have
! any clue as to the right size.  If you guess wrong, the window
! will jump from your wrong size to the correct size that has room
! to pack all its subwindows.  Alternatively, go ahead and pick a
! pixel size for the toplevel, but do not specify a geometry for
! the text subwindow.

  I actually killed two bugs today.  First, I found that the only way I could
really get this to work was to turn off remember window placement and specify
the geometry without the offset, or I could use window placement, but I had
an erroneous "exmh.geometry: " in my .exmh-defaults-color file, which I
imagine canceled the saved geometry, and I was just getting the default
geometry.  But now it does remember my geometry, and without specifying the
offset, I don't get the strange behavior any more!

  The second bug was that it was taking 5 minutes to exit from exmh.
After taking Mattias' recommendation and turning off remember window
placement and removing all my gazillion positions from my .exmh-defaults file,
exmh now exits immediately!  Oh happy day!

  Thanks for the help everyone.

    ...Lance

When a program opens a new window, it's opened at the screen where I'm working
at that moment instead of where the rest of the program is being displayed.
Well, maybe I express myself a bit confusing, but for example: when I run
Zircon in screen (1,1) and xfmail in (2,1), I'm writing a letter in xfmail,
then popups and new windows from Zircon get placed in (2,1) instead of (1,1)
where they belong.
How can I correct this behaviour ?

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

I'm using fvwm2 2.0.43. I've just switched from tvtwm and am pretty
happy to have adapted most of my favorite aspects of tvtwm to
fvwm. Except...

I use a large variety of titlebar colors on my desktop (each corresponds
to either an application type, or in the case of XEmacs or Xterms, to
the remote machine on which they're running).  On tvtwm this wasn't a
problem since Active Focus was indicated by changing the color of the
window border (one pixel around the edge of the whole window). On fvwm,
the only visual indication of Active Focus is a change in color of the
Title and Handles.  But there's only _one_ global HilightColor!  So, no
matter what color my XEmacs is when inactive, when active, it's always
the same color and I lose my color->hostname correspondence.  Confusing.

So. Is there a way (as in, did I miss something in the documentation),
or are there plans to allow setting the HilightColor on a
per-window/per-class basis (just as with Color), or perhaps (even
better!) a twm style "BorderColor" border around the active window so
that you can tell that a window is active even if its Title is obscured
and the Handles are too small to show their color? (I set BorderWidth and
HandleWidth to 2, so they're essentially always "black")

Thanks,

Just wondering if anyone is doing any work in this area.  I think it would
be terrific to have some CDE-like visual configuration tools as part of
fvwm(95).  Online menu editing would be a real boon (maybe something like
Netscape's bookmark management).  Button configuration, etc., anything to
make using and configuring fvwm easier, relieving the user of manually 
editing rc's, etc., would be such a blessing.

I think this would be a most productive avenue for any fvwm developers to
pursue.  In fact, I would much prefer to see effort concentrated on this
area than on, say, a Windows-like explorer (although I'm looking forward
to that, too!).

This site was posted to the list a few weeks ago. It's called The Dotfile
Generator and it does much more than just configure fvwm rc files, it does
all kinds of neat stuff. Here is the address:
http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/
It also contains screen shots in case you are unsure as to whether or not
you want to download it or not. It is very cool. It requires the Tcl/Tk
scripting languages to be installed, which can be found at:
http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/
Happy downloading!

This may be the wrong place to send this question.

Is it possible to define a 'screen 1' to be a printer.  It would have 2
colors (a foreground and a background) and take the dimensions of a
standard sheet of paper.  Regular X drawing commands would be used to
produce the page and dithering or halftoning and conversion to printer
commands such as postscript or  HP would be done in the new device
driver that, if it were the old regular one would be drawing to the
monitor.

To print then, you would simply redirect the same X drawing commands to
the root window of screen1 (or maybe screen -1)

Does this make any since to try?

Hi!
	I work in supressicon mode, and so all the icons dissapear from
my desk top when I iconize anything. That is cool! But, when I try
to deiconify them ( by clicking from the winlist), instead of appearing
in the current workspace, it appears on the workspace from where I iconified
it ....... can any one suggest me how to deiconify the stuff in my present
workspace and not from where I iconified it.
	Thanks,
				Swagato.

If I understand what you're asking for, I think that

Style "*" StickyIcon

might solve the problem for you.

I apologize for not responding sooner; I have been rather busy here.

I do have a more recent version; however, the only change is the addition
of handling for ClickToFocus. Other than that, it is [functionally] identical
to the current version.

Adding the line
 /^ClickToFocus$/      { print "Style \"*\" ClickToFocus"; next; }
to the script just after /^StickyIcons$/ will implement this change.

Other than that, I can't suggest anything. If you're familiar with awk,
you can try to extend the script. What features do you think are needed?

Bill Oswald also made some enhancements, which will be in the version
distributed in 2.0.44.  I've included it below.

--------------->8 'fvwmrc_convert' cut here 8<---------------
#!/bin/sh

# Some time ago, Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de> posted an
# incomplete script to convert fvwm-1 'rc' files to fvwm-2. I've just
# recently fixed and enhanced that script; it's complete (or nearly
# so) now. This should help if you choose to convert.
#
# I've also made a couple of other minor changes to make life easier
# for our users here: I changed the default initialization from "Read
# .fvwmrc" to "Read .fvwm2rc" (in fvwm/fvwmc), and I installed fvwm 2
# as "fvwm2". With these changes, users can easily convert at their
# leisure.
#
# Herewith the script. It's using GNU awk (gawk), but will run with
# any "new" awk (nawk on Suns (SunOS 4, Solaris), awk on most other
# systems). If you do not use gawk, it will be case-sensitive (the
# case of the fvwm commands must match those in the script
# exactly). With gawk, it'll be case-insensitive.

options don't show up).  Appended is a small patch to fix this and a
few other items.  (My knowledge of n/troff is very limited, but the
options show up as expected.)

Also, I noticed that m4 is invoked as "m4".  Could this be a security
hole?  Should the whole path be used by default, say /usr/bin/m4?  Of
course this breaks things if /usr/bin/m4 doesn't exist (like
Solaris).  However, there's always -m4prog to get the right one.

Yo!

With 2.0.43 and ClickToFocus on Solaris 2.5 (OpenWindows) I notice the
following:  I have something that executes

    xmessage -nearmouse -default okay -geometry +50+50 "$msg"

This makes this little window appear and I can do two things to make
it disappear:

(1) Click the `Okay' button with the mouse.
    This works fine: the window disappears and focus goes to the
    window that had focus before the xmessage window appeared.

(2) Hit the Return key.
    This also makes the xmessage window disappear, but focus *doesn't*
    return to the window that last had focus :-(

What's the story?

Instead of breaking it (or forcing the user to remember to use
-m4prog), how 'bout making it a compile time option, configurable
from Fvwm.tmpl?  This is a no-brainer and is easy to implement.
Included are my diffs.

I haven't tested it per se, but it compiled and had the correct path
when I glanced at the binary.

Before anyone makes any "fixes", please explain why this is even
considered a security hole.  Frankly I don't see it.  It's not like
FvwmM4 is being run setuid to root (or anyone else).  If fvwm is
started from a shell prompt, or a .xinitrc file, then presumably the
user's path will be properly set for what the user believes is the
correct m4 program.  If an attacker can modify the directories in that
user's path such that a different m4 is run then the attacker has got
that user hosed already and nothing can be done to FvwmM4 that will
help the user.  If fvwm is started from xdm or dtlogin and the user's
path is not set, then only system directories should be available, and
if none of those contains m4 then the user will probably get an error
message and figure out how to fix it :-) If an attacker can modify
those system directories, then the attacker has root and the game's
over.

In short, I don't see allowing m4 to be determined by PATH to be a
security hole in this particular case.  If there's something else I'm
missing, I'd be glad to know of it.

Thanks,

Here is what we did. We will have a closer look at the new script from
2.0.44 soon...

We modified fvwmrc_convert for easy things that we've found. You'll
find the diff under my signature.

Because we are not awk experts, we made a Perl front-end that
understands the things that we've found in our fvwmrc files and that
are not handled by fvwmrc_convert, namely:
 - ignore the case for popups (we had PopUp, Endpopup...)
 - handle submenus that are not indented:
Popup "SystemMenu"
Title   "System Menu"
Exec    "New Window"     exec xterm &
Popup   "Standard Tools" StdTools
[...]
EndPopup
 - handle menu names with spaces inside

Of course we would like very much to have a single script that can
handle all these...

Case should be ignored for this anyway, provided you are using GNU awk (gawk).
If you are not, I recommend you get it and use it.

Should be doable relatively easily, by adding a rule.

I forget how those should be converted. Perhaps the new script handles this...

Under FVWM2;

Is there an equivalent to OpaqueMoveSize for resizing?

Is there a way for me to direct commands to a particular window? In particular,
I would like to have some items on my menus that direct their commands to my
swallowed xterm.

Cheers,

Hi!
        I have a panel showing the different things in different workspaces.
I would like to mount icons on this panel, so that the panel doesn't
show me what is running where, and by clicking on one icon I would
like to change to that workspace. I tried associating a "*Goodstuff"
with a icon to do the Function , but perhaps I am missing the syntax :

 Function "go_desk1"
        GoToPage "Immediate" 0 1
 EndFunction

*GoodStuff - icon1.xpm Function go_desk1

	And also when I switch from one workspace to another, I
would like to know if it is possible to auto-iconify everything that was
there in that workspace.
	
	Thanks,
						Swagato.

But what if you _are_ root?  Before anyone goes stomping on me telling
me I'm an idiot to run X as root, let me say that I was forced into it
by the OS and no, I don't do it anymore.

True, 99.95% of the userbase will most likely never do this (unless
they have a death wish or are truly oblivious to pain), but of course,
99.95% of the people aren't trying to crack into the system.  And the
truly clueless (it happens to all of us) wouldn't think about this
kind of hole, so why leave it open?

I've fixed my sources -- but I'm not going to twist your arm to fix
yours. :)

Then so what?  If you, as root, are vulnerable to a trojan version of
m4, then either you've allowed someone write access to directories you
trust, you've allowed someone to write to your .profile (thus giving
you a PATH you didn't expect) or the attacker found some other way to
break root and won't be wasting her time putting a different version
of m4 in your path -- she'd just replace the standard one.

I think, I finally understand what you are trying to achieve. As I
could not find a solution that required changes to my .fvwmrc, only. I
had a look at the C source code and came up with a little
patch. Please note, that I do not really have a clue of what I am
doing ;-) I hope, Chuck won't kill me for introducing this
hack... OTOH, maybe it is a proper solution?

Subject: FVWM: Major New Pixmap/Title/Border Patch Released (Beta)
Mime-Version: 1.0 (generated by tm-edit 7.92)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Okay folks,

I've put up a new borderstyle patch (this patch has all the latest of
my patch stuff now).  There are many changes.  Only some are listed
here.  Obviously, it needs testing.  Although it is rewritten and
might have some intial bugs, the rewrite cleaned up interaction
between the pixmap button / titlebar code.

All of the new features are explained in the man page from the patch.
Please read it carefully!  It might not be obvious the way this works
at first.

Some Changes
-----------

* For starters, you can now stack button and title styles on top of
one another (AddButtonStyle/AddTitleStyle). E.g.:

	Titlestyle ActiveUp (VGradient 16 grey #001133)
	AddTitlestyle ActiveUp (Pixmap xterm.xpm)

This would first render a gradient followed by a centered pixmap (as
many stacked styles as you want can be put).

* The "Normal" style was name changed to "Vector."

* All the Full styles are gone, replaced by the Flat button flag
(handling should be cleaner as well, now it is truly flat).  Also,
ButtonStyle syntax was *changed*.  You can now specify *completely*
different style *stacks* for both up and down if you want.

* Buttons and titlebars have the same styles selection (i.e. buttons can
use gradients and titlebars can use *vectors*).

* There are now *face* style flags and *general* style flags. 

* UseTitleStyle is gone, and should be replaced by the new features.
UseBorderStyle and MWMButton are now a *general* style flags.

It can be found at:
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

Andrew

Hi there,
this has probably been asked/answered before, but I have looked through
the archives and can't seem to find it.
I have a sparc5 running SunOS 5.5.1 (solaris 2.4 whatever) and the
install (the MakeMakefiles and/or xmkmf) pukes due to it trying to do a 
imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config (solaris has it in /usr/openwin/lib/config)
the error displayes something about not being able to find Imake.tmpl,
which is in /usr/openwin/lib/config. I read about a patch for Imake.tmpl
or Imake in the archives, but could not get the patch from the archives.
Is there anyone who can enlighten me on this? I want to run fvwm- I really
would like to use something other than openwin.

thanks many!!!

Patrick Galbraith

Well, I installed fvwm2-95 on our SUNs running Solaris 2.5 (usually in an 
OpenWindows or CDE environment).
The X server is X11R5.
There was no problem.

Look at the /usr/openwin/bin/xmkmf shell script and you'll see that it
uses $OPENWINHOME/lib/X11/config if that environment variable is set.
Thus, setting the environment variable OPENWINHOME to /usr/openwin
then running xmkmf should do what you want.

The program "diff" can show you differences between files.  Let's say
you have two files foo and bar which are equal except for the third
line, then the command "diff foo bar" will show you output telling you
that the third line differs and what the third line looks like in the
files foo and bar, respectively.

Then, there is a program "patch" which uses a description as produced
by "diff" and can apply the changes.  Say you have the file foo and
the diff output from above, then running "patch" will put these two
together and create the file bar.

What this means for fvwm is that Andrew went ahead and modified the
source code for fvwm.  He used the program "diff" to produce a file
showing the differences between his modified version and the original.

You can now use that diff output to apply those same modifications to
the fvwm sources.  Thus, you get your copy of fvwm which is equal to
Andrew's and has Andrew's new features.

Such an output from "diff" to be used with "patch" is called a patch.

I have gotten wharf to work in fvwm, however, I cannot get it to Swallow
or MaxSwallow apps (xbiff, xload, asclock --- in particular) I have tried
numerous different configurations of and that's how I finaly got regular
buttons on it working, but I still cannot get swallow to work. If you
would like to see me fvwm2rc I can send it on an individual basis or put
it up on the web. I think it would be dumb to mass mail it to the entire
list... Or maybe not :) Please let me know if you know how to do this.
Thanx
Todd

I'm running Slackware 3.10 and when I use the default installation of X,
fvwm95 is set up as the window manager.  If you bring up the utilities
menu you will find a submenu called "Modules".  Under the Modules menu,
you find "Configure" with a small hammer icon.  When clicking on
"Configure" nothing happens.  When looking at the VC that X was started
from you get:

fvwm: No such module /usr/X11.../FvwmConfig

It seems as though the person who prepared the default .fvwm95rc either:

1) Forgot to include FvwmConfig with the    	
   distribution.
2) Put it on the menu in anticipation.
3) Has a very bad sense of humor.

I'm hoping for #2.  The ability to edit .fvwmrc and configure FVWM is
fantastic, however something like the Windows Control Panel would be
MUCH better! (Before the flames come: I HATE MS-WINDOWS of any flavor or
version (Including '95))

Does anyone know the scoop on fvwmconfig?????

This is of course correct, but more generally, a patch is any modification
to existing software, usually used in the context of an upgrade...

A while back, there was some mail regarding how to run fvwm instead of
CDE. I now work on an HP running HP-UX 10.2, hate CDE, and want to
continue running CDE. the mail I mentioned above seems to work on Suns
but not on HP. Has anyone gotten fvwm running instead of CDE on an HP?
If so, how did you do it?

I have recently switched to HP-UX 10.10 then 10.20 and this is one of the
things that is a big imporvement.  You don't have to hack script deep in the
VUE/CDE subsystem instead just put the following line in ~/.Xdefaults:

*wmStartupCommand: /home/tim/fvwm-2.0.43/fvwm/fvwm2

This really does have to be in the .Xdeafults file even though X resources are
kept in the server by CDE.  If you comment this line out you will be back to
normal CDE next time you log in.  I set my CDE login style to be Return-to-home
with just a few useful apps since I don't want CDE to try to figure out how to
restart all my apps when I log out.

When you want to log out you will have to do: Exec dtaction ExitSession
Simply exiting Fvwm will not work, it leaves you running without a window
manager which is interesting for a while but not very useable (it is pointer
focus and it doesn't support modality so that's one in the eye for the
ClickToFocusJihad brigade)

Cheers
Tim Phipps.

First off, I'm using fvwm95 with Linux 2.0.26 and X11R6.  What I'm
wanting to accomplish is this:

When I make a ppp connect to my service provider, I'd like some sort of
notification on screen in X that PPP is active.  The reason is, that
sometimes I get doing other things and forget that the PPP link is
burning away my online time.  I am looking for some method of on-screen
notification be it an icon, or a thing in the Taskbar, or in
FvwmButtons, or whatnot.  I figured that the easiest, and most visible
way, would be to change the color of the root window in my ip-up script,
and then when I do a 'ppp-off' my ip-down script can take care of
setting things back to normal.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

hey, all

just a quick question:   i was wondering how difficult it would be to have a
Button flag added to the Style command set, such that you could specify
something like:

Style "xterm"  Button 3 (Menu XTermOnlyMenu)

so that i could have, for instance, a menu with commands i would only want to
use with my xterm windows.   a better use might be for having some Function or
Module available through 'Button 7' click on XTerm window.   I don't see these
as only possible applications, but i think the functionality could be greatly
useful, and just wanted to determine feasibility and/or start a new thread.

on the other hand, this question might be moot if it could be (easily)
incorporated into the "Great Flag Rewrite."    ( hmmm, did that sound like
another "future feature" request ... ? )

thanks,
greg

Unfortunately (partly due to my haste) if you downloaded the tbsp4
patch there is only a chance you got a good patch.  To remedy this, a
brand new patch, tbsp4a is now available which works (compared to
tbsp4 at least :).  If you tried tbsp4, please try tbsp4a before you
email me of problems (of course, email me if you like / dislike
features too so I can pursue certain avenues).

However, as a bonus, you now get a working HiddenHandles style for the
borderstyle.   This time it works nicely.

You can get the latest patch at:
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

Thanks,
Andrew

Thank you, Markus, so very much! What a relief. Boy does it make raising
windows easier!

This has got to be up in the top two or three of my favorite patches to FVWM
in sometime.

Thanks again!

How do I set fvwm to raise a window with a shift-mb1 click?

Currently if I click in a window with the shift key (caps lock)
pressed, I cannot raise a window without removing the caps lock..

Any help would be greatly appreciated..

Okay, there were some requests, so the UseTitleStyle flag is back.
Also, more examples (and some fixes) are now in the man page.  The
ButtonStyle syntax has been made consistent with the TitleStyle syntax
(i.e., you can specify multiple definitions on a single line).
Explained in the man page, a quick example would be:

ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left UseTitleStyle
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey black
AddButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm) ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1

How can I determine the version of the fvwm I am using?  In the manual
page there is mention of a symbol FVWM_VERSION but I don't know how to
read it.  Can someone point me in the right direction.

Thank you

I have to say your patch looks mega cool. I have one question though.

When I put together my mini icons patch (so you can have application specific
miniature icons for a button in your titlebar, or in modules like FvwmIconMan
or FvwmWinList) last month or so, I tried to make them work as similarly to
the pixmap buttons as possible, both in terms of syntax and as far as the
actual code. I've been told by Chuck Hines that my mini icons patch would
probably make it into fvwm 2.0.44. Do you know how your stuff interacts with
my mini icon patch?

Hello !

I just came about the following problem:
I have installed fvwm95-2 on our SUNs running Solaris 2.5.
When I start ghostscript (gs) from an xterm and then press the iconify button, 
the window manager crashes !
The versions we are running:
	fvwm95-2: 2.0.42a
	      gs: 3.01
Does anyone have a clue what goes wrong here ?!

Thanks in advance,

	Ulrich Quill

Okay, there were some requests, so the UseTitleStyle flag is back.
Also, more examples (and some fixes) are now in the man page.  The
ButtonStyle syntax has been made consistent with the TitleStyle syntax
(i.e., you can specify multiple definitions on a single line).
Explained in the man page, a quick example would be:

ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left UseTitleStyle
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey black
AddButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm) ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1

Hello again,

I just had to notice that the same problem occurs with gnuplot.
Trying to iconify the plot window crashes the window manager.

Any ideas ?

Have You tried The Dotfile Generator? (And _yes_ I'm the author of the
Fvwm modules for this program -- it's GPL'd, though;).

It's a program for visual configuration of applications, among others Fvwm
1/2. You still have to restart fvwm after editing, though, since the
program generates the .rc file (don't worry - it doesn't overwrite
.fvwm2rc by default).

If You're interested, find out more from my web-page:
http://www.imada.ou.dk/~buk/fvwm/

Please note that the latest release is still in beta -- but then again, so
is Fvwm2 ;-)  The next release (due out next week, probably) will include
a parser to read existing .fvwm2rc files (or parts thereof).

Please tell me what You think of my modules.

In regards to the Fvwm title/borderstyle patch, has anyone been able to 
successfully modify the patch for fvwm95 (v2.0.42a specifically)?  I started
trying to patch it by hand, but ran into some major code differences.  Any
insight would be greatly appreciated.  As always, thanks in advance...

What I would like to set up is a window whose icon appears on all virtual
desktops, but whose window is only on desktops which I have specifically
de-iconified it.

Is this possible (I doubt it)

No, but this list doesn't deal with fvwm95 issues, since it is a hack
of fvwm.  Mail the author of that hack if you want help with it, or
try the latest vanilla fvwm beta (2.0.43) and see if you have the same
problem.

A couple of things to try.

echo $FVWM_VERSION
fvwm -v
fvwm -V
or man fvwm and look for a switch to output the version #

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! I am dust to your feet and ketchup to
your burgers. Precisely what I wanted. Now I no longer have a desktop, but
_A_ desktop! Thank you veryveryvery much.

PS: How on Earth is one supposed to use the patch you sent? I applied the
changes manually, but what's the proper way to do it?

Thanks again, Markus,

Quick Intro:

The BorderStyle patch is a patch which adds value to your existing
fvwm-2.0.43.  There are many things that it does.  The best way to
know what you can do with it is to read the associated man page
entries it changes for ButtonStyle / TitleStyle / AddButtonStyle /
AddTitleStyle  and BorderStyle.

I've put a new patch on my WWW page.  There are a number of notable
changes in it (i.e., the rewrite is starting to come of age :).  Note
that this is still in development.   Style tagging is not there.

Changes include:

         fix for MWMBorder flat button

         more man page updates

         consistency improvements changes
         (borderstyle/buttonstyle/titlestyle now very similar in operation)

         ButtonStyle now has an Inactive state 

         ButtonStyle flags (which include borderstyle / titlestyle )
         can now be negated by prefixing an ! 

         when changing flags, only changed flags are actually changed (i.e., for setting of multiple
         states at once) 

         titlestyle sunk, raised, flat flags removed (see next) 

         all buttonstyles now have a sunk and raised flag. This removes
         the need for the titlestyle flat, sunk and raised global options (do
         'titlestyle -- sunk' for a global effect).


Read the man page updates, since they are important.  If you find a
bug, make sure you have the latest version before you do anything.

As usual, it is at:
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

Enjoy,
Andrew

If you downloaded tbsp6 and your titlestyles for activeup and down
are reversed, just redownload the patch.

If you're using fvwm-2 (don't recall if fvwm-1 had this feature), you
can set up the window to have a sticky icon:

Style "thiswindow" StickyIcon

Then, if it's iconified, the icon will travel with you, but if you
deiconify it, it stays where it is.

Hmmm, why would you want to add the patch to fvwm95? AFAIK the main
differences between fvwm95 and fvwm2 are the mini-icons you can specify
for programs (you can add that to fvwm2 with the right patch), the looks
of the borders (but you want to change that with this patch), the taskbar
(also available for fvwm2) and the looks of the menu's (I'm sure you can
change that with the right configuration for fvwm2). Maybe some of it's
default behaviour too, but I'm sure you can configure fvwm2 in such a way
it'll behave like 95. So why not use fvwm2?

PS: Maybe there are more differences in fvwm95, I'm just not aware of
them... :)

I've placed a new borderstyle patch at the normal location which adds
a nonlinear gradient style as an alternate format to the previous
gradient.   Basically you say something like:

titlestyle vgradient 16 3 red 25 blue 25 black 50 grey

Which means a vertical gradient with 16 color cells and three
segments.   The first segment spans 25 percent of the color cells the
second 25 and the third 50.

Enjoy,
Andrew

There is a new style in the latest borderstyle patch.  It is the
Default style.  Also there is a command to reset all titlebar buttons
to their default versions.  You can also "append" the default, or
replace another button with any default button style (you can also put
one of the default button styles on the titlebar because of this).

for those of you using the miniicons patch to fvwm, I've put together a patch
so that you can use miniicons with Andrew Veliath's border style
patch (available from
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html).

To use (and I know this is gross, bear with me), apply this miniicon patch
to the fvwm sources AFTER applying the border style patch. I made my
patch relative to vers. 7 of the borderstyle patch, but it works with
version 7a as well (love the context diff).

Now could anyone tell me how can I apply the Title-bar Patch to
fvwm-2.0.43?

Min,

Although I'd recommend you download the latest borderstyle patch, that
patch should still work.  Make sure the diff you downloaded is
uncompressed properly.
 
Just 

zcat fvwm-2.0.43.tar.gz | tar -xf -
patch -s < fvwm-2.0.43.tbp8.diff
cd fvwm-2.0.43
xmkmf; make Makefiles; make

Then you can do what you want with the binary (you might want to copy
it as fvwm2.tbp8 or install it by cd fvwm/; make install install.man).

Regards,
Andrew

You are welcome; I am glad that you like the patch.

I think, somebody else already answered this question, but then, it
might have been on one of the other mailing lists that I am subscribed
to.

If you have two (or more) files that differ only slightly, it is
usually better to send the changes only, rather than the entire
files. In order to make this process more automatic, there is a
powerful tool called "diff". It will calculate a list of the
differences and output a description of what needs to be changed in
order to get from the old version of the file, to the new
version. This is what is called a patch file. There are different
output options (c.f. "man diff"), but context-style or unified patches
are most human-readable and also offer a couple of other technical
benefits.

In order to automatically apply patches, you need to run the patch
file thru the tool "patch". The nice thing about this tool is, that it
ignores all additional information that it might find in the input
file. Thus you can directly pipe the news article into "pipe" without
having to strip the extra text lines.

You should probably have a look at the man pages for "patch" if you
never used it before; but I will give you a few hints. "patch" always
works relative to the current directory. This might not be exactly the
same as the one that was used for creating the patch files with
"diff".

For instance, the patch file might have been created in the directory
"/usr/src"; then all "fvwm" related filenames will be preceded with
"fvwm-2.0.43". On the other hand, you might have stored your source
tree in "/usr/tmp/my-fvwm", thus the prefix "fvwm-2.0.43" does not
work for you. In this case, you change into the directory
"/usr/tmp/my-fvwm" and then tell "patch" to strip off the first part
of the path. You do this by passing the option "-p1". Actually, it is
a very good idea, to always use this option even when it might not
appear to be neccessary, because it has yet another side effect that
spares you some trouble. So just make it a rule, to always pass this
option; in most cases it will probably have the form "-p0", which
tells "patch" not to strip any part of the patch.

There are two other options that I use frequently. "-l" tells "patch"
to ignore difference in "white-space" (that is, different amounts of
space or tab characters); "-s" tells "patch" to not echo the contents
of the input file to the screen.

After you ran "patch", the original files still exist. They will have
been renamed, so that the suffix ".orig" is attached to the name. This
allows you to revert to the original version, if the patch did not
work. If for some reason there have been problems, then you will find
files that end in ".rej". These files contain patches that could not
be applied.

Good luck and let me know, if you need further information,


Markus

Hi,
	I'm officially apologizing for spamming this list now if what I am
about to present has already been discussed. I would also like to say that
I am no programmer, and I probably won't be one any time in the near
future... Ok... here's my idea...

	I've noticed a proliforation of window managers based on either
fvwm or fvwm2. There's AfterStep (originally bowman), Enlightenment,
Fvwm-95... and I'm sure there are others that I haven't even seen or
thought of... 
	I was wondering if maybe it wouldn't be a better idea to make a
new module called FvwmBorder which would handle decorations and stuff like
that... Then, you can have the modules recognize a certain file type which
contains a description of the borders... the way they look ... etc... I
haven't really played with fvwm2 a whole lot, but I'm thinking you could
have something like this:

*FvwmDecorBorderPath /usr/local/lib/fvwm2/borders:/home/myhome/fvwm2/myborders
*FvwmDecorBorder	enlightenment
*FvwmDecor etc...etc... 

and you could set up the window manager in such a way that in itself, it
has some simple standard, and through this module, you can expand the
Decorations and choose what you like without say having to recompile or
compile a new window manager which you like better... 
	You would be able to specify ... lets say... a borders directory
or a decor directory which would contain the files for the FvwmDecor
module to decorate windows for your session... You could set it up in such
a way so that you could just switch Decorations on the fly without having
to have two seperate .rc files... 
	I am suggesting this for two reasons: 1) it would probably make
fvwm2 smaller memory-wise (which I believe was one of the original goals
of fvwm) and 2) it would definitely take up less space on my hard drive :)
There are many "based on fvwm2 and really close to it, just looks sorta
different" window managers out there and I think it'd be benificial to the
authors if they didn't have to change some of the functionality and then
have to re-release it as something else cuz they can't work a patch or
something into the major distribution of fvwm2... It would probably also
make it easier from an administration standpoint, the ability to offer
your users many looks without having a whole bunch of binaries to
install...
	Thanx for your time... If this seems stupid, please be nice about
it, don't flame me to high heaven... Thanx for your consideration...
			-peace

Hey folks!

This is a very basic newbie question, since I am nothing but a Linux
newbie: Could someone please tell me some basic things to check and do
to install fvwm2?
As per the install file, I typed xmkmf;make Makefiles and was given back
"make: ***No rule to make target 'Makefiles'. Stop".  
I have never 'made' or compiled a file in Linux before.  What should I do
and what should I read to become more familiar?
I'm currently running fvwm (in Slackware2.0.0) and I'm loving it.
Thanks for reading and considering.
-Randy C.

I've tried to get the FvwmCpp thing working with gcc (yes, I want to use
gcc) but can't get it to work.

Just putting the fvwm2rc file through gcc with the command:

gcc -x c -E -DOPTION1 fvwm2rc

works fine, but I can't figure out what to write in my Xsession file, that
starts up fvwm2. I've tried several things, the latest is:

eval fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp -Cppprog /usr/local/bin/cpp -Cppopt -DOPTION1 $HOME/.X/exp/fvwm2rc"

but I can't even get it to work with the "real" cpp!

I've checked every web site I can find, I've read the mailing list archive
(and found a couple of hints, but none that works), I've played around for
hours fiddling with these things, when I have better things to do.

I _really_ want to use gcc, since I'm using this on both Sun SparcStation 4,
Sun ELC, SGI Indy, PC Pentium (Linux), and RS600 machines, and gcc
produces exactly the same output using the same switches on all those
machines. Please someone help me out here!

Many many many thanks in advance.

I see no need for an apology. I think this is needed. I was planning on
waiting until after the final 2.0 release came out before diving into this.

I'm not sure that this is best done with a fvwm module though. There's a lot
of back and forth that has to go on between the code that draws the borders,
and the rest of fvwm. It might be best to start off just thinking about it as
a shared library. That way it'll be easiest to begin the process of teasing
out the decoration specific code. Once that's done, if it turns out to be
easily put in a module, then cool. 

This also requires rewriting the fvwm style code, and adding the ability to
specify styles that fvwm doesn't even know about. For example, suppose we're
making an fvwm95 module, and that fvwm didn't have miniicons. You're going to
want a way to specify that xterm's get this pixmap, netscape gets that pixmap,
etc. You can either do this by duplicating the style command in the module, or
by extending the style command. But I don't know if we want to add fvwm styles
for everything that every decoration module wants. Perhaps we would just have
to have to classes of styles: builtin fvwm styles which are represented the
current way, and extra styles, which are just strings in a hash table.

You shouldn't have done "make Makefiles", it should have been
"./MakeMakefiles". So you type "xmkmf;./MakeMakefiles" and after that the
normal "make", "make install" and "make install.man". This should do the
trick... :)

I have a new patch, tbsp8 available.  First, it adds a new borderstyle
flag which supplements the HiddenHandles, NoInset (with this, you can
nearly duplicate fvwm95 look).  Also, *much* more code can now be
compiled out.  

Then, there is a new thing.  In response to people wanting different
"looks," there is a compile-time option to add code for general style
tagging which can be applied with the Style command to particular
windows.  Although it uses the Style command, it doesn't use a style
flag (but because of this even the *new* MiniIcons patch won't
patch... Brady? :) As a compile time option you can also disable the
use of multistyles (add/button/title styles).

After a lot of sweat here, with this, you have this new ability for
fvwm-2.0.43:

AddToLook CustomLook1
+ <button/border/titlestyle/hilight color command>
+ <etc.>
Style "-CustomLook1-" UseLook CustomLook1,HandleWidth 1,NoButton 2

AddToLook CustomLook2
+ <button/border/titlestyle/hilight color command>
+ <etc.>
Style "-CustomLook2-" UseLook CustomLook2,HandleWidth 4

Then you can do:

Style "*rxvt*" UseStyle -CustomLook1-
Style "*xterm*" UseStyle -CustomLook2-

I played around briefly and in about 10 minutes had an xterm which
look similar to NeXT and an rxvt which looked like W95 and a Netscape
which looked mwm, but the idea is that you can compile in USELOOK
support even without pixmap buttons/titlebars/borders/gradients and
at least use it to define window classes.

Here is an excerpt from the patched Fvwm.tmpl:

 * -DPIXMAP_TITLEBARS		!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 * 
 * Allows use of the styled title-bars using the TitleStyle 
 * command in a similar fashion to the ButtonStyle command.
 * If Xpm support and PIXMAP_BUTTONS is compiled in,
 * then you can also use pixmaps on title-bars.
 *
 *
 * -DBORDERSTYLE		!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * This compiles in support for different border styles using 
 * the BorderStyle command. See the man page entries for BorderStyle 
 * for detailed usage information.
 *
 *
 * -DGRADIENTS			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * Compiles in support for the use of both horizontal and 
 * vertical, linear and nonlinear gradients for buttons and 
 * title-bars. See the man page button style entries for
 * HGradient and VGradient for more information.
 *
 *
 * -DMULTISTYLE			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 *
 * Allows the use of stacked styles for buttons and title-bars.
 * There is a slight memory penalty for each stacked style
 * over the default ones. See AddButtonStyle and AddTitleStyle 
 * for more information.
 *
 * 
 * -DUSELOOK			!!!PATCH ADDITION!!!!
 * 
 * Allows the creation of tagged looks, any of which can be
 * assigned to a window using the UseLook Style command.  To create
 * "look" definitions, see the man page entries for AddToLook 
 * and DestroyLook.  There is a slight memory penalty for each added
 * look, probably at least 10k (more or less depending on previous
 * compile setings and individual styles).

To Everyone:
Thanks very much for the plethora of replys that I received concerning
some sort of on-screen notification of being connected to my ISP while
in X.  The onscreen color change seemed to be the easiest, and I think
the most useful and visible.  I chose the 'xsetroot' method and it works
absolutely fantastic!

Here is what I ended up with:
[Bottom line of /etc/ppp/ip-up
xsetroot -solid orange -d :0

[Bottom line of /etc/ppp/ip-down
xsetroot -solid navyblue -d :0

Now the only problem is that if I quit X while logged on to my provider,
and then start it up again (more accurately: when Netscape 3.01 CRASHES
MY ENTIRE X SESSION and I have to restart it) the window is back to it's
default blue color.

Two problems:
   1) I've changed the default color of the root window in .xinitrc with
      'xsetroot -solid navyblue' however when X starts up the screen
goes       navy blue, and then 4 seconds later when fvwm starts, the
screen          reverts to the original (unknown) color.  I would like
to        
      permanently change the root window's default color in .fvwmrc95
if        possible(or wherever it is stored).  Can anyone help?

   2) What can I put in .xinitrc to test wether or not I'm online and
if        I am then set the window to orange, otherwise set it to
navyblue?
      My scripting abilities are not yet to the point where I can
figure        out stuff like this easily.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A miniicon patch for this is at:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/miniicons.tbsp8.patch
	or
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/miniicon_patch/miniicons.tbsp8.patch

The patches for version 7 of the borderstyle patch are there as well.

Wonderful idea. I just came home, only to find that I'd left my ppp
link up and running for the last two hours.  Guess I'd better change
to an unmetered account. :>

You might want to make this a bit cleaner by testing for a running
X before changing root - One of these days, you might end up with
an xsetroot that likes to barf, instead of dying gracefully.

[ -f /var/run/server.0.pid ] && xsetroot -solid <and so forth>

That works for me - I'm running Xaccel.  I don't know if XFree or
MetroX use the same pidfile.  I think so, but...

Hmm.  I'm guessing here - it sounds like there's something either
in InitFunction or RestartFunction that's changing your root color,
or possibly a Style *root* command? Find it, dump it. :>

Does fvwm95 change your root color on a normal start, or just when 
restarting after an NS crash?

Tell me about it. :>

Here's a quick modification of a line I use to get mail if my link
is up -

[ -f /var/run/ppp0.pid ] && xsetroot -solid orange -d :0 

#	Tests for presence of pppd's pidfile - It's worked for
#	me so far.  You might have to change the /var/run location,
#	if your setup is different.

If you put that in after the xsetroot...blue command, you'll be all
set.  Either that, or you can yank the xsetroot...blue and take
care of the whole thing in an if-then.  

if [ -f /var/run/ppp0.pid ] ; then
   xsetroot -solid orange -d :0
else
   xsetroot -solid navyblue -d :0
fi

Now that I've spouted off, I'd better test these things...

look at the InitFunction in .fvwm2rc
there's an entry there, which changes the root window again.

Maybe 'netstat -i' with a suitable 'grep' for your PPP connection would
be more accurate and not incur the delays inherent for 'ping'

Hi,

Sorry for the cross posting, but I was requested to look for a program
and I do not know where to start.  So, I thought that I would querry the
people I talk with a lot (Okay, so I listen more than I talk).

One of the users here is looking for a program that is basically an xterm
with user definable buttons along the top.  The buttons can be defined to
send pre-defined commands to the xterm, make use of the current X-selection
in the xterm, etc.  I was figuring something like that might be doable
using
TkSteal and defining the buttons in tcl/tk, but I am not sure where to
start.

Does anyone know of a simular program already in existance or how such
a program should be done?  Thanks in advance for your help.

I'm not too knowledgable about X, but I was wondering if it would be possible 
to in impliment something like Mac's WindowShade. In case you don't know what 
that is, it allows you to click twice on the windows title to collapse the 
window to just it's title row.  

I know that this can be simulated by just Iconifying the windows to their 
title without an icon, but this doesn't keep the windows original width 
information when it's iconified. By this I mean, I like to tell which window 
I'm selecting by the windows width as well as it's title, since sometimes I'm 
working on different windows with the same title but at different widths.  

Plus, I'm sot sure if it's my settings, but when I Iconify a window the icon 
is placed to the right of where the actual window was located, which is 
annoying.

For what it's worth, I noticed AfterStep supports this (not that I
personally have a use for it, but...)

See http://mango.sfasu.edu/~frank/afterstep/

Of course if you're fond of some of fvwm 2's features you may not want
to change, since AfterStep is based on fvwm 1...

Enjoy,
 Andrew

  I believe there's an easier way, although I'm still experimenting to get
  rid of a few quirks due to my use of zsh.

  Create ~/.dtprofile, and put this single line in it:

    SESSIONTYPE=xdm

  Create ~/.xession as in any other xdm based system.

  Log out/log in, and you should get whatever wm your ~/.xsession desires.

It's possible, but the way I do it is not too nice... :( Back in the days
with Win95 I had a program that did the same and I loved it. It's very
easy to get to see transient windows again. Here's what I have in my
.fvwm2rc:

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "M" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "C" Maximize    0 1p
+                               "D" Maximize    100 100

Mouse 1         T       A       Move-or-Raise

Mouse 0         8       A       Maximize 0 1p

Key Tab         A       C       Maximize        0 1p

As you can see I have a function which is singly defined for the titlebar.
The normal "Click" causes a window to Maximize to 1 pixel in height, en
null in width (keeps original width). If I move the cursor while holding
mousebutton 1, I'll move and raise the window, doubleclicking it will
maximize the window.

I also have a button (number 8) which _maximizes_ the window in that way
plus that I've added a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Tab).

The disadvantage of doing it this way is that you use the Maximize
function and that a _titlebarred_ window is brought to the top of your
screen (not in layers, but to the pixelrow 0). Anyway, it's a start... :)

Hope this helps...

Here's a "WindowShade" function for fvwm 2.0.43 I worked up with an
added feature of being able to force the window shade up or down with
an argument.

I've not tested it much, so don't expect much :)...

Andrew

--------------------------------------------------
       Dotfile Generator 2.0 Beta 5 Now Available
      ----------------------------------------------- 1996 Dec 10 ---


  This note is to announce the second public beta relase of The Dotfile
  Generator version 2.0. Since the first beta release a lot of bugs have
  been fixed, and the fvwm module can now read the .fvwmrc file!


What is the Dotfile Generator
-----------------------------
  The Dotfile Generator is a tool to help the end user configure basic
  things as well as exotic features of his or her favorite programs
  without knowing the syntax of the configuration files, or reading
  hundreds of pages in a manual.


The Fvwm2 module
---------------
  This module is without comparison the largest and most extended module
  for The Dotfile Generator. Included is a few standard configurations,
  which you may start up with, and the capability of reading the original
  dotfile (except module settings).

The Bash module
---------------
  The Bash module, included in the Dotfile Generator 2.0, will assist you
  in configuring Bash, using a graphic user interface, without you having
  to learn all the cryptic commands. Help is embedded, and will give you 
  a short introduction to each option. 

  The module consists of 17 configuration pages, logically ordered in 
  two major groups, which makes it easier to find a specific option 
  (e.g. setting up shell prompt, command aliases, completion, error 
  handling and much more).

  If you are interested in further information about the Bash module, you
  are welcome to visit its homepage at
  http://www.imada.ou.dk/~pzacho/bash

Other Modules
-------------
  The Dotfile Generator 2.0 beta 5 is accompanied by a number of other
  modules besides the Bash and Fvwm module, namely:

  o tcsh module
    Configuration of Tcsh shell. Tcsh is a counterpart to Bash (--they are
    both shells).

  o elm module
    the ELectronic Mailer.

  o emacs module
    Configuration of emacs text editor.

  o rtin module
    Configuration of rtin - a USENET news reader.

  o fvwm1 module
    You should really convert to ver 2.0!

Where do I get it?
------------------
  You can get a FREE copy directly from our ftp-site

  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/dotfile.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/dotfile.tar.Z

Requirements
------------
  The Dotfile Generator requires Tcl/Tk, but don't 
  let that scare you, Tcl/Tk compiles on almost every machine that 
  runs X windows.

  You can find Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0 at

  ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tk4.0.tar.gz

  or for Linux users, here are a precompiled set for X11R6 at

  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/tcl74.tgz
  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/tk40.tgz

Please let me know if you have any problems!
--------------------------------------------
If you have any problems with The Dotfile Generator (especially
installation problems) please mail them directly to
me. (blackie@imada.ou.dk)

Since the fvwm2 modules parser is new in this version, Jeppe Buk
(buk@imada.ou.dk) would very much like to receive any "PARSER NOTE:" lines
which the parser generates.

Kind Regards Jesper Pedersen (blackie@imada.ou.dk)

I have started using fvwm2 (2.0.43) and was wondering if any of the
following features are possible:

1) Ability to resize a window during active placement, like other window
   managers (twm) can. Click (and hold) to place window, then drag window
   grid to desired size, and release.

2) Change a window's ClickToFocus/FocusFollowsMouse setting after the window
   has already been placed. Sometimes, I'll have an xterm that I open to
   tail a log file or something and I decide I don't want it autoraising.
   Setting it to ClickToFocus would alleviate that problem. A nice generic
   solution would be nice, but I would be happy with a solution specific to
   xterm if there is some way to do it by changing the window's title/icon
   name/class/etc. (i.e., have an "clickXterm" class defined in .fvwm2rc
   that is set to ClickToFocus and then somehow tell fvwm2 to use that class
   instead of "xterm".)

3) Override SmartPlacement/CleverPlacement/etc to ActivePlacement on-the-
   fly. For instance, I'd like to have a pop-up menu choice that says "xterm"
   (which does SmartPlacement) and a "Place xterm" option, that would have
   some option on that line to tell it to use ActivePlacement for the next
   window. This would be especially useful with my first question above,
   because then if you know you want a 100x60 xterm, you could easily do it
   all at once...

Also, I just got a second head for my Sparc, and when I start fvwm2, it makes
both screens look identical: it starts two button bars, two xloads, two
asclocks... even two FvwmAuto's (is that really necessary?!?!) I'd like to
have different configurations for each screen. Are there samples of how to do
this with m4? (I am already pre-processing my files with m4.)

Thanks for any suggestions,
Eddy

Ok this maybe impossible but ,

What I'm looking for is a way to make the background of a window (an xterm 
for example) transparent. This could be toggle on-off with a button on the
title bar.

This of course may not be possible from the window manager and
would require modifications on the client.(hence the problem would be
modify all clients where this could be usefull !)

Hey folks,
I'm trying to compile fvwm2.0.43, and having trouble.
I tried xmkmf;./MakeMakefiles
and within several lines of the compilation status there was:
"no rule to make target /lib/libfvwm2.a: stop".
I'm a newbie and have never compiled anything before, how should I
proceed?
Also, how do I check what version is currently running while in X
window?

thanks for the patience and consideration
-Randy C.

Proceed by telling on what platform you're compiling fvwm and what you've
done before you typed "make" in the dir /bla/fvwm-2.0.43/ (hope you typed
it there and not in the fvwm/ dir, first you need to build the things in
lib/). _Normally_ fvwm2 compiles straight Out Of The Box.

Depending on what version of fvwm (1 or 2) you're running either type in
an xterm "fvwm -version" of "fvwm2 -version".

Hello, all...  I am new to fvwm (and I'm not even all that use to
messing around with X apps), and I'm trying to set it up to organize
different "tasks" I do on different desktops (which seems like an
obvious use for fvwm to me).  Just as a note, each of these "tasks"
may involve one or more emacs windows, Xterms, etc being open.

Anyway, in order to make it really nice for seperating the tasks, I'd
like to be able to do at least ONE of the following, and so far I
haven't been able to figure out how to do any:

(1) Using the icon box (which seems to mean using FvwmIconBox??) I'd
like to be able to move around the icons within the box at will,
placing them wherever I like.

(2) I'd like to have the icon's in the icon box NOT be sticky so that
when I switch windows, the icon box in that window only shows apps
that were activated in that window.

(3) Even if all that is impossible with fvwm, I'd AT LEAST like to be
able to tell which windows are open by looking at the icon in the icon
box (e.g. open windows have shaded icons).  Is this very simple, very
obviously desirable ability possible with fvwm?

In the end, I may have to try not using an icon box, but that's just
might be much more annoying than not being able to do any of the above
(assuming that I can't do any of the above).  I mean, I HATE (1)
having icon's that can be easily covered up with windows (with the
icon box, if just one spot on the icon box is uncovered, I am just one
click away from having access to all my icons) and (2) having icons
disapear when the app is de-iconized--the app is still there, it
should still have the "place" for its icon reserved, I should still
be able to double click on an icon to get to the app (in case it's
window is covered up, for example), etc.  These are the reasons I
really like the icon box, but I'm used to using the icon box in mwm,
and it makes FvwmIconBox look totally second-rate, IMO.

Any suggestions as to how I can do one of the things I have listed
here??  Any suggestions at all will be appreciated.  Thanks!!

I've placed my fvwm2 WindowShade function patch on my
BorderStyle/UseDecor patch page at:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

There are two versions, one for plain vanilla fvwm2 and one for use
with the BorderStyle/UseDecor patch (they are exactly the same, just
patched to different fvwm2 trees).

There are some minor but important changes from the one's I've posted
before:

	- the child window is no longer resized

	Before, many of my client windows didn't seem to know how
	to handle being resized so small (Netscape, rxvt, etc.), so
	now this problem should be completely alleviated since the
	child window is no longer resized.

	- It should be a bit faster

	- It fully compiles out

Enjoy,
Andrew

hey, all

since i was keeping up with alot of the latest patches, especially from
Andrew and Brady, i put up my source tree to make some of the latest
add-ins available to all.   this is meant just a single access point for
some of the nicer additions, and should help those who have are having
trouble keeping up with all these pieces.   even after the next beta, i'm
sure there will be add-ins that pop up, so i will try to stay on top of all
of it! :-)

the site should generally have the latest patches available, except on
weekends when i'm not usually available (the machine is at work).  right
now, the tree is patched up with the UseDecor v9b patch, the windowshade
patch v1 (??), and the MiniIcons patch ( v??), hence the patch file is
called 'fvwm-2.0.43.tbsp9b.wsp1.miniicons.diff', and also includes Andrew's
Cascade and Tile modules, and Brady's IconMan v9 module.

and as i said, right now the site is just a link to the source tree, so
there's no pretty index to guide you around.   i'll try to set something up
before the end of the week, though.

it's laid out somewhat sensibly.   there's a 'patches' dir to hold patches,
'modules' for the modules, etc.  'fvwm-2.0.43' will be the current tree,
with some others probably lying around.  the machine is a Linux/Pentium
box, so that's what any compiled code will be for.   

the URL is <URL:http://phantom.iweb.net/fvwm/>

let me know of any suggestions, problems, etc.
greg

I'm wanting to fix some FvwmIconMan behavior that's always bugged me. When a
manager window doesn't have any windows to manage, it unmaps itself. When it
gets windows, it then maps itself. When that happens, the manager window gets
raised to the top of the window stack. In my personal setup I have one manager
window devoted to emacs windows, and if I switch from a page with emacses to 
one without, and then back, my FvwmIconMan window typically is sitting on top
of one of my emacs windows.

Before this degenerates further into vagueness, here's an example:

On page 1, I have an emacs window sitting on top of my FvwmIconMan window
On page 2, I have nothing

Switching from pages 1 -> 2, my FvwmIconMan disappears.
Switching from pages 2 -> 1, my FvwmIconMan reappears and is on top.

Since my FvwmIconMan windows are sticky, things work more nicely when my
window doesn't have to unmap itself. Another example:

Page 1: emacs window and an FvwmIconMan window
Page 2: some xterms.
In this case, I have one FvwmIconMan window managing everything, so when
I switch from 1 -> 2, my FvwmIconMan window doesn't unmap/map itself, since 
on both pages it's managing > 0 windows. Now, what's mega cool is that suppose
on page 1, my FvwmIconMan is beneath an emacs window, and on page 2, it's on
top of an xterm. If I flip back and forth between the two, everything stays
just the way it should. 

So, I guess what I want is that when a window gets unmapped, that it not
"lose" it's place in the window stack. How should I achieve this? (Either
making a change to fvwm, neato X tricks, or "read the damn manpage" are
perfectly accceptable).

Suppose a program creates a window and doesn't specify X, Y coords. This
window then gets placed by fvwm according to whatever scheme is
appropriate. Lets say, SmartPlacement. Then this window later gets unmapped
with XUnmapWindow(), and then get remapped with XMapWindow(). At this point,
should it be subject to being placed again? I would say no, yet fvwm replaces
the window. If I use SmartPlacement, then the window pops up in some
semirandom place, and if I use ActivePlacement, then I have to manually
replace it. Really though, it shouldn't matter whether the app is iconified by
fvwm or iconifies itself (when I uniconify a window which fvwm iconified, it
goes back to its original location).

This is somewhat embarassing, since the app is FvwmIconMan, and this happens
if you omit a geometry line in the .fvwm2rc (something I never do, so I never
noticed this behavior). I never noticed this until Andrew Veliath commented on
how much he liked how FvwmIconMan kept moving itself around so that it was
unobstructed.

I'm running a CyrixP150+,PCI,1.6 IDE WD caviar on primary, CDROM on
secondary.
I untarred the fvwm2.0.43.tgz in the /tmp to check it out and see what its
effects would be.  I then typed xmkmf;./MakeMakefiles and things
seemed to go okay except for the

Uhmm, I kind of meant: "What kind of OS are you compiling fvwm on?"  So
answer something like "Linux", "SunOS 4.X", etc. Sorry if I wasn't clear
enough about that. Newbie, aren't you?

Does this error occur with the "./MakeMakefiles" command? This seems
pretty strange to me. Anyone else have a solution for this?

Fvwm has this, and it works just like in twm: when the grid appears,
use mouse button 1 to place it, mouse button 2 to resize it before
placing.  Sadly, Fvwm doesn't grok mouse button 3 (zoom bottom),
though.

I sent this out once before, but it was before I actually joined the
list, so I'm tring it again...


Hello, all...  I am new to fvwm (and I'm not even all that use to
messing around with X apps in general), and I'm trying to set it up to
organize different "tasks" of mine on different desktops (which seems
like an obvious use for fvwm to me).  Just as a note, each of these
"tasks" may involve one or more emacs windows, Xterms, etc being open.

Anyway, in order to make it really nice for seperating the tasks, I'd
like to be able to do at least ONE of the following, and so far I
haven't been able to figure out how to do any:

(1) Using the icon box (which seems to mean using FvwmIconBox??) I'd
like to be able to move around the icons within the box at will,
placing them wherever I like.

(2) I'd like to have the icon's in the icon box NOT be sticky so that
when I switch windows, the icon box in that window only shows apps
that were activated in that window.

(3) Even if all that is impossible with fvwm, I'd AT LEAST like to be
able to tell which windows are open by looking at the icon in the icon
box (e.g. open windows have shaded icons).  Is this very simple, very
obviously desirable ability possible with fvwm?

In the end, I may have to try not using an icon box, but that just
might be much more annoying than not being able to do any of the above
(assuming that I can't do any of the above).  I mean, I HATE (1)
having icon's that can be easily covered up with windows (with the
icon box, if just one spot on the icon box is uncovered, I am just one
click away from having access to all my icons) and (2) having icons
disapear when the app is de-iconized--the app is still there, it
should still have the "place" for its icon reserved, I should still be
able to double click on an icon to get to the app (in case it's window
is covered up, for example), etc.  These are the reasons I really like
the icon box, but I'm used to using the icon box in mwm, and it makes
FvwmIconBox look totally second-rate, IMO.

Any suggestions as to how I can do any of the things I have listed
here??  Any suggestions at all will be appreciated.  Thanks!!


-Jay

Hello,
first of all thanks for creating the patch archive.
I've compiled fvwm-2.0.43 on Sun Sparc running Solaris2.5 using gcc,
and got it working.
Now I would like to apply the patch

fvwm-2.0.43.tbsp9b.wsp1a.miniicons.patch

I tried with this command

patch -c -p0 -ifvwm-2.0.43.tbsp9b.wsp1a.miniicons.patch

and this is what I get 

Looks like a new-style context diff.
Malformed patch at line 48:
patch: Line must begin with '+ ', '  ', or '! '.

line 48 is 
Only in fvwm-2.0.43/: Makefile

If I delete this line it happens anyway for empty lines and lines
starting with diff.
Sorry, this is the first time I try to apply a patch....

What should I do? Edit the patch file? How?

					thanks Marina

  Hi.

  I am a relative newbie to all this, so I beg for your patience.

  I am attempting to build FVWM-2 on an Intel running NetBSD 1.2.  During
  the build, I receive an error...

  Picture.c:33: X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory
  *** Error code 1

  Now, I looked all through my XFree86 distribution (v 3.2) and nowhere in
  there is the xpm.h header.  Is this header supposed to be in the X11R6.2
  distribution, or is it supposed to be with the FVWM distribution?  Where
  can I get this file, and others that I may be missing?

  Thanks

  sakm

How can an average X program figure out which desktop it has been 
  brought up on??? And how can you force a window to go to a particular
 desktop ( or at least come up on a particular desktop ) ???
 Is this currently possible??? 

  I've been trying the "*desk" resource, with mixed results.
 Is there someway the program can call XtSetValues and XtGetValues
 to get and set desktop information ??? Or am I missing something ???

OK, I guess I'd better send my reply again. Forgot to CC it to you the first
time.

Well, FvwmIconMan does 2 and 3. It'll also tell you which window has the
focus. The focus feature is mainly useful in distinguishing all of my many
xterm's from each other. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 1. Do
you mean move the icons around, or what?

My homepage contains a screenshot of FvwmIconMan in action:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/

Basically, you can configure FvwmIconMan to create multiple managers, each
managing some set of windows (determined by regular expression matching), and
each having some resolution (like only show the windows which are on the
current page, current desk, or show all windows), and a bunch o' other stuff,
most of it which came about when somebody new started using it and sent me a
big old piece of mail suggesting improvements.

Also, I believe thet the FvwmTaskBar module now has the ability to only list
windows on the current page. It looks like the windows 95 taskbar. It was
written for fvwm95, but I've been told it works with fvwm. It's certainly a
personal decision about whether to use something that looks like microsoft
wrote it, but I'll admit that it looks rather sharp, even if it does take up
more screen real estate than necessary. Something to talk about with your
doctor.

It's in neither distribution, you have to install XPM yourself as stated in
the FAQ file of the FVWM distribution :

13) I'm trying to build FVWM, but the linker is complaining about
    missing functions like 'XpmReadFileToPixmap' or the compiler can't
    find the include file X11/xpm.h.  Why is that?

A: You need to have the Xpm library on your system.  You can find the
   source for it at ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries.  Or you can
   compile without Xpm support (see the configure.h file) and lose out
   on all the pretty color icons.

Anyway, I'm writing this message on a NetBSD 1.2 box with XFree86 3.2 and
FVWM 2.0.43 and it works just fine so you shouldn't have any problem when
you have XPM installed.

WIBNI all the Style command would be undoable?  Then one could send
Fvwm the command

    Style "*" StartsOnDesk foo

Then one could start some application.  Then one could send Fvwm the
command

    Style "*" StartsOnCurrentDesk

which would undo the first Style command.  (Keeping all the specific
Style "foo" commands, of course!)

Wouldn't you all *love* this?  Or isn't it worth the effort?

This seems to place things in different windows on the current desktop,
but doesn't actually seem to move them across desktops. 
 
xterm -xrm "*desk:2"
 seems to bring up an xterm on the second desktop, but If I add a line
like
xterm*desk: 2
to my resource file, it doesn't seem to do anything.

Also, I don't know how to query this, in case the window is dragged 
 across desktops.

Ah... well I just checked with the guy in charge of putting this stuff
on the system around here, and we have fvwm2b40 which doesn't include
FvwmIconMan :-(

Perhaps he will get around to updating the version within the next,
oh, few _months_ (I'm guessing :-).  Until then, I guess I'm
stuck. (Unless someone knows how and wants to explain how I can get
this one module myself and somehow make it work with the fvwm we have
installed here...anyone?  anyone? :-) No, _really_ anyone?

In any case, the IconMan sounds pretty nice.  As for what I meant by
#1...
(1) Using the icon box (which seems to mean using FvwmIconBox??)
I'd like to be able to move around the icons within the box at
will, placing them wherever I like.
...
yes, I'd like to be able to click on an icon and move it to some
particular part of the icon box to make that it's understood
location.  That way I can separate out certain Icon's visually from
certain other Icons without having to rely on any particular regular
expression matching (I'd just say... hmm, these two apps are related
to the same task, so I want them both in this corner of the icon box,
for example).  Of course, being able to have separate icons show up
depending on what window I am in, for example, would work well too.

Have something on my desktop look like Windows 95 (or anything else
microsoft wrote)????  NO thank you!  :-)

Hi,
Is there a way to turn off window list which appears with a mouse button click?
In my current setup it appears when mouse button 3 is pressed. I tried to look
for a resource in the default .fvwmrc file that I downloaded but couldn't find it.
I am running fvwm on DEC alpha.

Also I would be interested to know how many of you prefer the FvwmWinList or
the window list that appears as pop-up menu to the
FvwmPager? We are tring to create a default .fvwmrc file for our users at this
site and are wondering whether it should be turned off or on. I would appreciate
any feedback on this.

Thanks,
Mita.

Hello,

  I'm running fvwm2 on RH 4.0 and I can't get my changes 
to the .fv.... file to take.  I'm modifying the .fvwm2rc
and the .fvwm2rc.init files?  What am I doing wrong?

thanks,

jamie

p.s. Is fvwm2 the same as fvwm95.  And are these the
     same as fvwm95-2?

It isn't too difficult to compile fvwm yourself.  You need to have
done this before, though.

Nothing more than editing Fvwm.tmpl then running xmkmf, then make,
then make install.

You could use desks for that.  Just have one desk for task A, one for
task B.  That way you don't even have to iconify your windows :-)

I have one desk for sysadmin stuff, one for WWW stuff, one `home' desk
for reading mail and programming, one for doing TeX stuff, and 2
`miscellaneous' desks.  You can have up to 32768 (or so, it's 2**15)
desks, that should be enough for all practical purposes :-)

I've been using the standard fvwm iconbox to hold my icons.  However,
I'm looking at using FvwmIconBox.  This works just fine, except that
with several pages (virtual screens), FvwmIconBox holds way too many
icons to be useful.

Is there a way to tell FvwmIconBox to show only the icons on the
current screen?

Thanks,

Ray

One should normally delete links and pass the output of a diff into a
grep -v "Only in" if there are other files present (that patch was not
made by me).

Try something like (providing your grep supports -v).

grep -v "Only in" < fvwm-2.0.43.tbsp9b.wsp1a.miniicons.patch | patch -p0

I am sending this to the two lists thatt seem to have been doing this the
most lately for me:

When adressing mail both to somone, and to the list, please, please put
the list in the 'to:' line, as some people using filter programs to sort
thier mail are having thier inboxes flooded by messages that one person
sends to somone, CCs the list on, and other people reply to. I've had
about 75 message the past two weeks from these two lists like this.

    Hi, Mita --

    You don't say whether you're using Version 1 or 2 (I highly recommend the
latter, don't be put off by the "beta" tag); but in either case, the mouse
bindings section is fairly close to the end of the default .fvwmrc / .fvwm2rc
file. Look for a line something like
           Mouse 3		R    	A      	WindowList
and coment it out if you like. Or change it to do something else. I hate to
suggest the obvious, but you really ought to check the fvwm man page for a
description of the mouse and keyboard bindings, because there's a good
deal of info there. Then if you're stuck, query the mailing list again.

    MM>  I am running fvwm on DEC alpha.

    [ Sigh. ]

    MM>  We...are wondering whether [the window list] should be turned off 
    MM>  or on.

    Personally, I can't imagine why anyone would want to deprive himself
(or his users) of this useful tool, which doesn't take up any screen real
estate or consume any extra resources when not in use. But it needn't be 
bound to Mouse-3 clicked on the root window, if you don't care for that 
(I do like it that way). You could bury it in a menu or bind it to something
else. 

    As for FvwmWinList, I rarely use it (to be honest, I bring it up 
occasionally for a change of desktop scenery), but a great many find it
very useful.

    Hope this helps.


    Cheers & Season's Greetings,
    Bob

Umm, not that this belongs on this list or anything, but:

Please don't ask other people to make up for the deficiencies in your
software.  The method of CC'ing the list and mailing to the originator of
the message is age old and isn't going to be changed simply because someone
uses filtering software that can't check the CC header (or better, envelope
sender).

Oh!  Seems like this exists, but is called StartsAnyWhere.  Now, how
do you send these Style commands to Fvwm from a shell script?

Use FvwmPipe, or FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS -- I think that both of these
have been posted to the fvwm mailing list (or maybe the -workers
lists).  I think I remember that Chuck said that FvwmCommand/S may be
put in the 'extras' subdirectory of the long-awaited 2.0.44 release.

Email me (NOT the list!) if you would like either of these set up for
fvwm2 or fvwm95 (yes, I use BOTH).

Subject: FVWM: Patch: HilightBordersOnly
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

Here's a patch to fvwm 2.0.43 that adds a new .fvwm2rc option: 

	HilightBordersOnly 

When set, it causes fvwm to use the HilightColor for the title-bar and
border relief GC, but not to change the title/border background
color. This is sort of like the standard tvtwm/twm behavior of drawing a
colored border around the active window, but not to change the title
color.  (as I detailed in a previous message, I use a wide variety of
title colors to mark different types of applications and a single
HilightColor was confusing (since all active windows ended up the same
color).

For example, I set: 

	HilightBordersOnly 
	HilightColor white red

and this causes the active window to be hilighted with a red border. 

Let me know what you think,

Hello,
thanks to Andrew's and your advices I succeeded in using patch.
Actually I downloaded gnu patch and use the standard command
as you suggested.
But I have new problems....
I get errors on applying the patches, for example
------------------------------------
Patching file fvwm-2.0.43/fvwm/add_window.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 63.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 86 with fuzz 1 (offset -3 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 115 (offset -3 lines).
Hunk #4 failed at 187.
Hunk #5 succeeded at 219 (offset -20 lines).
Hunk #6 failed at 482.
Hunk #7 succeeded at 571 (offset -68 lines).
Hunk #8 failed at 861.
Hunk #9 failed at 877.
Hunk #10 succeeded at 945 (offset -27 lines).
Hunk #11 succeeded at 936 (offset -72 lines).
Hunk #12 succeeded at 1013 (offset -31 lines).
Hunk #13 succeeded at 1000 (offset -76 lines).
4 out of 13 hunks failed--saving rejects to fvwm-2.0.43/fvwm/add_window.c.rej
Hmm...  The next patch looks like a new-style context diff to me...
----------------------------------

Before bothering you again I decided to download again 
fvwm distribution.
I tried with the files in 
http://phantom.iweb.net/fvwm/
both the standard distribution and the full distribution,
to be sure I had no wrong version files.
Same result.
Finally since you have been so kind to publish the full patched
source files, I downloaded those for which I had a failure.
But compiling does not work!

{ ... } groups a number of statements into one statement.  As you're
grouping just one statement you can omit the { ... } safely, I should
think.

The Exec directive probably means that Fvwm just tries to exec the
first word as a program, as that is "{", it doesn't have much luck.

You can always do

Exec /bin/sh -c "{ ssh -n forte6 run_cmd forte-ioc } >/dev/console 2>&1 &"

I suppose.

Does this help?

It looks like your patching messed something up somewhere.  I see
-DMINI_ICONS in your defines.  I have not tested tbsp9d with them.

Please wait for 2.0.44 unless you know what you are doing.  These are
actually development patches (which is now noted on my page).  The
latest patch I've tried works fine on a number of platforms.

    Do you really want to do that? I normally do one of the following
to change Style settings on the fly.

    If I get a sudden notion to make some ad hoc change, I just use
FvwmTalk to send the appropriate command to fvwm.

    If it's something that I do quite often, then I define functions and/or
menu items in my .fvwmrc. Something like

      AddToFunc  XtermOnDesk3    Nop
      +                "I"                    Style "xterm" StartsOnDesk 3
      +                "I"                    Exec xterm -[my favorite xterm opts]
      +                "I"                    Style "xterm" StartsAnyWhere

would do the trick, with maybe a menu item like

      AddToMenu  Some-Misc-Stuff    "Some Miscellaneous Stuff"    Title
      +                "Start Special Xterm on Desk 3"    XtermOnDesk3

Note that once you've defined a function, you can invoke it on the fly
just like any built-in fvwm function. So you could just say "XtermOnDesk3"
via FvwmTalk.

    Hope this helps. If you really, really, really, really need to send fvwm
commands from a script, you may need to look at doing a hack of FvwmTalk
to catch your script's stdout.

        Cheers,
        Bob

You're right.  And FvwmForm allows me to interactively enter the name
of a program that I'd like to start on some desk.  I think I might not
need this after all...  But then I think I don't really need that
feature of starting apps on some other desk than the current one.  The
original poster now knows what can be done, as well.

Thanks for your helpful reply,

I'm becoming less and less able to cope with how FvwmIconMan windows pop to
the top of the screen when they get mapped, which happens whenever a manager
window goes from having no windows to display to displaying some. Looking
through the fvwm source, it doesn't seem at all easy to make it get mapped
anywhere else than the top.

So, I see two options: 

1. instead of unmapping the window, move it to someplace like -100000,
   -100000, and then move it back to its original location when it's got
   something to show.

2. When a manager window runs empty, just draw something pleasing to the eye
   in it, and don't unmap it. 

He seems to prefer 2.

As for what to draw, I'm not exactly sure. Pixmaps are problematic, both for
portability and because I have no idea what the geometry is going to be.  I'm
thinking of something like the icon title of that manager window (which you
can set in the .fvwm2rc) raised in a 3-d fashion to fit in with the general
visual style of things, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that.

I'd like to assign audio files to different events in fvwm.  Is it
possible?  If so how?  For example:  How would I set it up so that when
I get incoming mail a file called you_have_mail.au is played?

Thanks in advance.

Hi all, been reading the list for a while...my first post :)

I gotta re-iterate kai's message regarding icon use in general - Use
Desktops instead. Is that legitamate advice, to point out a feature that
you think functionally replaces what the person is trying to do. The Pager
is truly an amazing thing, and I been reading this list for a while now
and I have to wonder if people don't recognize the power you get at such a
small overhead...

But anyways I think you want to unstick your icons - in your .fvwmrc
(yea i'm still on 1) or your .fvwm2rc file (i hope that's right)
and comment/remove StickyIcons like in this example

########################      ICON STUFF
##############################
# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature....
# specify left top right bottom of box

IconBox 183 712 358 741

#SuppressIcons
#StubbornIcons
#StubbornIconPlacement
#StickyIcons

This is what's in my file, icons stay on desk/screen you leave them.

mail arrival is not an fvwm event.
But when mail is received, the demon looks for ~/.forward.
Usually a mail forward address is put there, but you can also start a
command from there.
Make this a batchfile and put some playaudio command there (or better
send a command to your fvwm to play sth, since another user would be
quite surprised if the demon was invoked while you're not there.)

So:
~/.forward:
|~albrecht/.mailfilter


~/.mailfilter (shortened):
#!/usr/local/lbin/tcsh -f
# 
# Mail filter for various mail services with vaction support.
#

cleanup:

/bin/rm -f $tmpf

exit 0












so simply add

	if [ -p ~/.fvwmpipe ] then
	# or any other test to check if fvwm2 is running under your account
	# e.g exit code of: ps -axu | grep $User | grep fvwm2

	# better send the command to fvwm2 for execution (via FvwmPipe)
		echo exec playaudio $HOME/mail_has_come_my_master.au >>~/.fvwmpipe 
	endif

on the top.

Hi, 

I don't remember how to send a command or event to Fvwm from the shell. I've
look around in man pages and docs, but seems to miss it.  I thought I'd seen it
once (or am I dreaming... again?).

PURPOSE: I'd like to send an event to the FvwmAudio module from a script file.

Thanks for any help...

PS: I've been a while out of the loop since someone disconnected me from
Internet so excuse me if I sound behind you all...

Hello,

I hope this isn't a FAQ. I have a FvwmButtons button which invokes the
warp-or-run function on xemacs.  Here's the function:

AddToFunc warp-or-run           "I" Next [$0 CirculateHit] Iconify -1
+                               "I" Next [$0 CirculateHit] Focus
+                               "I" None [$0] $1
   
If the xemacs has multiple frames (windows) on different desktops the
original xemacs frame is raised and the desktop is changed to the
desktop holding the original frame.

I would much prefer to raise the xemacs frame on the current desk.
Does anyone know how to achieve this?

Many thanks,
Richard Everson.

The FvwmAudio module can play sounds for fvwm events like, open
window, close window, iconify, etc.

Playing sounds for mail delivery should be done with your .forward file.
Try something like this:

FVWM 2.0.43.

Is it possible to get FVWM to ignore application-specified icons? I
don't use FvwmIconBox or FvwmIconMan, just the standard "iconbox" Style
-- my icons end up on the desktop. 

The problem is that I really don't like big 24x24 or 32x32 icons. I much
prefer a simple box with just the window name in it (no graphics). This
is how my XTerms iconify. I want to force my XEmacs's and Netscapes to
do the same, but can't figure out how. 

Is there something I can set in my .fvwm2rc?  Maybe in my .Xdefaults?
I've tried to RTFM, but I can't find anything in the fvwm man page.

Thanks in advance,

I just asked a similar question to this mailing list, and everyone 
was very helpful.  They mentioned the FvwmPipe and the 
FvwmCommand modules. I've downloaded FvwmPipe, and it seems to work,
but it seems to eat up a lot of CPU after the first command is sent to
the pipe.

What you could try is creating a small blank xpm icon, say 10x1 pixels
and make all the pixels transparent. Call it blank.xpm or something similar 
and then override Netscape's icons with a line like

Style "Netscape" Icon blank.xpm 

in your .fvwm2rc.
Then when you restart you'll just have a little text box.

Good Luck

Martin.

Thanks for the suggestion, but it didn't work. Here's the .xpm file I
created: 

	/* XPM */
	static char * transparent_xpm[] = {
	"40 1 1 1",
	" 	s None	c none",
	"                                        "};

and it's in my PixmapPath.

I set: 
	Style "*" Icon transparent.xpm

yet both my Netscape and XEmacs icons end up with big (64x64?) icons. 

For what it's worth, the XEmacs icons initially start out as I want them
(but then they did even before I specified this transparent.xpm icon),
but right after startup (after parsing the .emacs file), it seems that
XEmacs installs a new icon which overrides the original.  

I _can_, however, add this to my .emacs: 

 (if (boundp 'frame-icon-glyph)
    ;; XEmacs 19.14 installs a huge icon by default (19.13 and earlier didn't...)
    (set-glyph-image frame-icon-glyph "~/bin/transparent.xpm"))

to override Emacs's override.  But that still leaves me with big
Netscape icons.

Also: with a transparent XEmacs icon, if I try to move the icon, it goes
completely invisible -- not even the title is visible during the
move. This is different than my Xterm icons (which stay visible during a
move), so I guess this isn't exactly the same as whatever FVWN us doing
by default...

More ideas?

Look at the logic in icons.c and you'll see why nothing overrides
the application's pixmap suggestion. The code looks first for a bitmap
or pixmap specified in .fvwm2rc. If the window is still of zero size after
that it tries the app's IconWindowHint, then the IconPixmapHint.

However, here's a small patch I did some time ago that can override these
hints by saying, e.g.
    Style "Netscape*"  Icon NoPixmap

Hope that does what you want.

Well You had

 Style "*" Icon Transparent.xpm

Whereas I have 

 Style "*" Icon question.xpm

yet my netscape uses it's own icon

however if I add 

Style "Netscape" Icon netscape.xpm

it uses the pixmap instead so try specifying the individual applications 
or at least classes/resources...

good luck...

Try this:

AddToFunc warp-current-desk-or-run
+ I Next [$0 CirculateHit CurrentDesk] Iconify -1
+ I Next [$0 CirculateHit CurrentDesk] Focus
+ I None [$0 CirculateHit CurrentDesk] $1

You might also want to try CurrentScreen instead of CurrentDesk.

Hey folks!
I'm having trouble compiling fvwm2.
Here's exactly what I do:
1) tar xvzf fvwm-2_0.gz
 while in /var/X11R6/lib which creates the directory fvwm-2.0.43 and all
the other files.
2) cd to fvwm-2.0.43 and type xmkmf;./MakeMakefiles
-which seems to do ok
3) type make install
-which gives errors: ***No fule to make target ../../libs/libfvwm2.a
needed by _(several items)_ .  Stop.
-in several lines.
Could someone please help me with this?
Thanks for reading and considering!
-Randy C.

Compiling on an Ultra-sparc running solaris 2.5.1 and getting this waring
messages from gcc:

gcc: language F not reconized

The flag that is being used with gcc is "-xF" I believe, that is the
problem. What is this about? I suppose that this is a flag that can be
passed the the commercial /usr/ucb/cc compiler?

The trick is that if you're going to change compilers, you have to change
the Imake setups to match if you want to use Imake to build X programs.  On
most Suns, the Imake setup is in /usr/openwin/lib/config.

 Hi All,

I am working hard on learning to configure fvwm2, but the following two
problems remained unsolved for weeks now, so I bother you.

 1) When I click on the window titlebar, the window gets stuck to the
   mouse and wants to be drawn to a new position. This is the way it
   should behave when I keep the mousebutton pressed, but it does so
   also when I release it within a split second. If the timeinterval
   between pressing and releasing is too small or too big, nothing
   happens.

 2) An iconified window gets back to the screen in the background when
   I doubleclick on it. But I'd like it in the foreground!


Is it possible that I have a buggy version (2.0.42) of fvwm2? Or is
it really possible to configure it out? Any help? Thanx!

yours,
  Matthias

Andrew,

I was just going to have a play with your latest patch as I've been 
meaning to investigate the possibilities but I can't actually find a
link to the patch itself on your page (fvwm_border_picture.html).

Is there a problem ith the patch? 


cheers,

I've taken them down as I've noted before.  They are actually working
as well as they've ever, but most of the main debugging and
development is over so I am waiting for the next phase now (which is
being worked on).

Give it a week or two.

I am looking for a good email program too. I use Netscape because I
could
not find something better. When I was using Windows, I used Pegasus Mail
I think it has all the functionnalities needed. But unfortunately,
it does not run on Unix, Linux platforms. Do you know if exmh
has more features than Netscape? And what about asmail?

Subject: FVWM: Bug when calling Iconify from InitFunction
Reply-To: schiotz@fysik.dtu.dk
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

Hi!

When I log in using the departmental X terminals, I get an xterm
running, and then the window manager is started from the .login file.
I use fvwm version 2.0.43 with the CleverPlacement patch.  I would
like to iconify the initial startup window as soon as fvwm has
started, so I use this InitFunction:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" 
+		"I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen xterm] Iconify 1
+		"I" Module FvwmButtons
+		"I" CursorMove 30 40

When fvwm2 starts up, the xterm is iconified, but immediately
deiconifies again.  The deiconified window is not updated, so only the
frame shows, the xterm window shows what was below it when it
deiconified, but the contents move along with the window.  Choosing
refresh screen from the menu causes the xterm window to become black.
It becomes normal if I use the mouse to iconify and deiconify it
again.  Adding the same command to the RestartFunction causes the same
weird behavior.

I use SloppyFocus, and the only modules I start are the pager and
FvwmButtons.

Any suggestions?

Jakob

The best I found, and the one I'm using now is ML.  Nice look and good
functionality.  The only problem is that is Motif-based.  There is a statically
linked executable on the ftp site, and someone has found out that it compiles
and run with lesstif 0.71.

This is the URL: http://www-SMI.Stanford.EDU/projects/imap/ml/index.html

Hello,
I think a very nice e-mail program is XFmail. It uses Xforms library.
It has a lot of useful features, and nice graphics.
You can find it at

http://Burka.NetVision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html

This is completely my own personal opinion. Picking email readers
is similar to picking an editor.
I prefer exmh to openwindow's mailtool, zmail, netscape's mail, and 
any command line email tool. I have not tried asmail.

Have you given the icons no pixmap? If so this was a known bug which
was fixed for 2.0.43.

It has enough for me. And if you are running Linux you can (and should)
be using procmail to process your mail., no matter what mail tool you use.

"Real Soon Now" :)

Actually, it is getting close.  I have some more minor things to
finish, then Andrew Veliath (who has a few more finals to take over
the next few days) has agreed to merge his latest Borderstyle patch (I
couldn't keep up with his changes) into my current development version
which will become 2.0.44-almost, which I will then give to the workers
mailing list for pre release testing.

Then shortly after that I'll release 2.0.44 (ideally, less than a
week).

Then a few weeks later I'd like to get 2.1.0 out (will only be bug
fixes and minor updates).

Chuck

ps - this prompted me to add another FAQ question:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

34) When will fvwm release X.Y.Z be ready?

A: This is always a difficult question to answer.  I work on fvwm in
   my rather nebulous and semi-mythical "spare time", therefore I
   usually can't provide an exact answer for this, since my time
   estimates for it are often wrong/changing.

   "Real Soon Now" is one of my favorite responses when they are
   getting close, but then, who is to say what "close" means? :)

   Never fear though, as they will keep coming...  I do try to post
   periodic status reports to the mailing lists, so you could search
   the archives at any point in time to see if I've made any reports
   lately.

I'm currently using exmh 2.0alpha. It's got a few bugs (alpha release 'n 
all) but it's a very good mailer. It has excellent MIME support, 
integrated PGP, mail fetching via POP3 (and can do multiple methods of 
incorporating mail), filtering via either the separate procmail package or 
the MH slocal package, coloured folder labels to indicate new mail, an 
icon which acts as a biff replacement, facesaver support, glimpse fulltext 
searching (making it easy to find that email you know you have somewhere) 
HTML documentation, etc etc. It's definitely at the high-power end of the

thread such as Zmail. 

Of the Windows mailers I'd say it surpasses Pegasus by miles and Eudora

For some odd reason I cant get applications to install a private
colormap.   Even "netscape -install" does not work.

I'm using 2.0.43 and HP-UX 10.10

When programs (like netscape) try to install colormaps it silently
fails. (or has no effect what so ever.)

Has anybody else seen this ?  (beter yet, fixed it ?)

Regards, and thanks in advance.

Andrew sent out a note earlier this week saying that he's taken the patches
offline (i believe in order to stabilize them & get them ready for fvwm
2.0.44 .... and i think he's going through finals to boot  <good luck,
andrew!>).    you're better off waiting for the full release to come out,
which is "Real Soon Now".   but if you just can't wait, cause it is a cool
patch, you can grab it from my machine:

I'd kinda like to have a different style for the Netscape mailer
than for all other Netscape windows. I tried the following, but
it didn;t seem to help. 

BTW, I'm using fvwm95-2.0.42a.

Style "Netscape*"        TitleIcon mini-nscape.xpm
Style "Netscape Mail*"   TitleIcon mini-mail.xpm, Sticky

TIA,

Jon.

I'd like to not have an icon for a particular window, but so that
it doesn't disappear into Nirvana should I hit the iconify button
(in fvwm95), it would be cool to ditch thee options for this one

Use the module FvwmIdentify to determine the Class of a window and use
that for the "Netscape*THING" in the Style line.

BTW: This is a fvwm2 mailinglist, not fvwm95.

	then xterms get an icon, but they won't go into the

Hello, 

  I'd like to stick my pager at a specific geometry,
so I set the FvwmGeometry variable to what I want,
but the pager is nevertheless "SmartPlace" 'd   
because I state I want SmartPlacement.  Is there
any way to get smart placement for all the windows
except the pager?

thanks, 

jamie

One more thing,

  Whenever I invoke the pager, I'm always denied scrolling
access to half of it.  Does anyone know how to get rid of
this?

I.E. :

If this is my pager (representing 18 virtual desktops),
then I cannot scroll over the line consisting of d's
from either side of it.  I have to click with the pager.

Stange as it may seem, along with the name of the icon, you need NoIcon:

  Style "XTerm"   SloppyFocus, Icon xterm.xpm, NoIcon IconBox

This is in the man page.

Hello!

I've got a small problem. My menus (in the root window) won't stay up when
I have pressed and relased the button. I know I used to have it
configured like that, but I've lost my fvwm2rc and I just can't figure out
how do this anymore. Really annoying.

Thanks in advance,

	--miSh

Mine stay up (FVWM 2.0.43), but I do have a request for a change in how
pull-right (submenus) behave.

Currently in FVWM, if I click and release a button to get a menu, it
stays up until I make another click. So far so good. But if I need to
traverse to a submenu (via Popup), there's no way to get it to stay
up. This is a pain since it requires somewhat precise mouse movement to
position the mouse to the right far enough to start selecting from it.

I'm more used to Motif-style submenus (e.g. in XEmacs with the
--with-menubars=lucid option), where you can click on the "|>" in the
main menu to cause the submenu to stay up.

I can get stay up submenus if I use Menu instead of Popup in my main
menu, but then I don't see a "|>" in the main menu, and the main menu
doesn't stay around to allow me to change my mind (and perhaps choose a
different submenu).

All I want are Motif style submenus which stay up if clicked.  Is there
a way to configure this from my .fvwm2rc, or am I going to have to hack
fvwm/menu.c?

Use 'Menu <name> Nop' instead of 'Popup <name>'.

Something like:

This is the difference between desktops and pages - the desktops are
disjoint so you cannot get to them via edge scrolling.

The next version of the FAQ contains the following description, to
clarify what is meant by a Desktop, a Page, and a Screen:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

27) What exactly is the differenct between a DESK, a PAGE, and the
    SCREEN?

A: Our naming convention is sometimes a source of confusion, and when
   discussing problems and the like it's good to maintain a consistent
   meaning.  To illustrate how features of fvwm should be referred to
   - fvwm has multiple disjoint DESKTOPS, each of which is comprised
   of M by N PAGES, which are each the size of the physical SCREEN.
   The physical SCREEN acts as a viewport over one of the PAGES of the
   current DESK.  Here's a picture to clarify (also, take a look at
   the FvwmPager module):

             Desk 0                     Desk 1
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     | Page 0 0 | Page 1 0 |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     ||Page 0 1|| Page 1 1 |    |          |          |
     ||        ||          |    |          |          |
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+

   It shows two 2 x 2 DESKTOPS.  If the current DESK were number 0,
   and the current PAGE were 0 1, the SCREEN would show only the
   windows located there, plus any sticky ones.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want one big desk, change your DeskTopSize:

  DeskTopSize 6 3

But how do I specify the specific position in which I want the pager
to appear?

Hey folks,

I finally got off my butt and glommed together a new release of my
Python modules for Fvwm 2.x.  Point your browser at

    <http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/pyware/>

You should find on-line documentation, and a gzip'd tar file for your
enjoyment.  Alas, I never found the time to complete my rewrite of
FvwmPager so I ripped out most of the functionality that I never used
and am releasing just Pydesks, a simpler Ctwm-like desktop manager.
Sigh, maybe someday.

Anyway, as always I'd love to get some feedback from anybody who uses
this stuff!

Enjoy,
-Barry

P.S. Chuck, please check out

    <http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/pyware/fvwm_man.html#caveats>

There's a couple of notes there about some things in the Fvwm API that
are inconvenient for doing modules using Tk.

Hello!

Does anyone know if there exist any "transparent pagers" out there? What I
want is a pager that I can see, for example, my background image behind.

Hope you know what I mean.

Is anyone using the new FvwmForm module (in the extras directory 
of the 2.0.43 source).  If so, does anyone have any sample scripts
that they could forward to me.  I used the one sample to do some
things, but it really doesn't help much when trying to use
TextFields.

I really like being able to read from script files.  That way,
you don't have yo restart fvwm each time you make a change
to the script - VERY NICE.

How can I make my windows to be "full window resize". And, when I press my

I thought it would be nifty to have the Windows NT (TM) color schemes
for my Unix fvwm2 setup, so I have written a package to do that.  I've
to do some cleanups and a bit more on it then I might release it.

I want to know if people are interested in a package like this.
Instead of trying to duplicate your color schemes from your Windows NT
(!)  setup (I admit some are not too bad :), what I have working now
will take all of your color schemes and then translate them into a
suitable format for say, fvwm 2 beta or fvwm95 (right now it will give
you a menu of *all* your color schemes from your Windows setup).  It
requires that you actually have a Windows setup to do the obtain the
raw data however.

There are some pics near the bottom of:

Merry Christmas!

	I am trying to convert my existing fvwmrc file to use with fvwm. I have
	several questions, but let's deal with them one at a time. 

	The existing fvwmrc file puts xload and xclock into the button men u
	bar using commands like this :

	*FvwmButtons -       whatever    Swallow "xload" Exec xload -bg
	\#908090 -geomet
	ry -1500-1500 

	These don't seem to be working under fvwm2. I don't think it is even
	reserving space for these buttons.

	What am I doing wrong here ?

	Second, I would like to proprocess my fvwm2rc file with M4 like fvwm 
	did. The man page says to start fvwm2 like this to make this happen.


	/usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc" &

	But when I do this I get some &really* strange results. My fvwm2rc file
	is basicly just my fvwmrc file run thorught the gawk conversion script.
	Should I do something different here?

	Third how can I simulate the "clamp: icon functionality from fvwm in
	fvwmrc2?

	Thanks for your help here.

	A bit more inof here. First the task *is* runining, I see it wiht ps.
	Second, FvwmButtons *is* reserving spce for these, just nothing is
	appearing in them. The confusion here was that I had an odd number of
	buttons defined, so i was used to seeing a blank button. The conversion
	script removed 1 button completly, therefore I now have an even number
	of buttons, and should have no blanks.

Subject: FVWM: FvwmIconMan Bug?
To: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I are currently migrating from vtwm to fvwm-2.0.43 on SunOS 4.1.3 and
Solaris 2.5.1.  My enviroments are as follows:

 VERSION: fvwm-2.0.43, FvwmIconMan 0.9 (and prior)
COMPILER: gcc-2.7.2
 OPTIONS: -O2 -DSHAPE -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DXPM

      OS: SunOS 4.1.4           OS: SunOS 5.5.1
  SERVER: MIT X11R5         SERVER: Sun Microsystems, Inc. 3.51

In the process of migrating, I have uncovered the following problems
with FvwmIconMan:

1. The configuration option:

     *FvwmIconMan*resolution page

causes FvwmIconMan to exhibit buggy behavior when switching pages; in
particular, there appears to be an off-by-one error in the viewport
bounds-checking logic.  This bug causes a window that abuts the edge
of the screen to appear in the icon manager on multiple pages.  I
traced the bug to the function win_in_viewport() in file
modules/FvwmIconMan/fvwm.c .   Rather than attempt to debug the logic,
I just simplified it.  The new function definition and context diff are
appended to this message.

2. There appears to be a problem with the "dontshow" configuration
option.  We have a misbehaving news application that continuously
updates the icon name and title with progress information.  This produces
unpleasant behavior, particularly over ISDN.  I tried using the following
lines in my .fvwm2rc to suppress the headline window in the icon manager:

    Style "*Query*Headline*" Icon news.xpm
    Style "*received*of*" Icon news.xpm
    *FvwmIconMan*dontshow *Query*Headline*
    *FvwmIconMan*dontshow *received*of*

This has the desired effect upon starting the application.  However, if
I iconify the window, it suddenly appears in the icon manager.  Under
FvwmIconMan-0.5, it remained in the icon manager.  Using FvwmIconMan-0.9,
the icon is removed from the icon manager when it is de-iconified.  I tried
creating separate lines with title= and icon= before the patterns, but
this did not affect the behavior.  I have successfully worked around the
problem by using the "WindowListSkip" style for these patterns, in place
of the "dontshow" option to FvwmIconMan.

Many thanks to everyone who has worked to make Fvwm the best window
manager available!

I'm the author of FvwmIconMan.

This might not be a problem with FvwmIconMan. In the last few years, I've seen
this behavior fairly often, but when looking REAL careful, it always turns out
that the offending window is actually extending into the next page by 1
pixel. Xv seems fond of doing this when it resizes and moves itself.I've
though about making a little fudge in the logic so that a window has to be in
the current page by at least a few pixels to count. Please check if this is
what's happening for you. An easy way to check is to set EdgeResistance in
your .fvwm2rc to something nice and big (I use "EdgeResistance 10000 100") and
then move the offending window up the the edge of the page. With
EdgeResistance set, fvwm should keep the window entirely in the current page.

As for your patch, it seems correct. How embarrassing.

FvwmIconMan determines which manager, if any, manages a window each time the
window name changes. I can't tell from what you said whether this is the cause
of your problem, or if the problem stems from a bug in this process. Could you
be more specific about what the title and icon names are when the program is
showing up in the manager, and when it isn't? Also, does the window title or
icon name change when the window is uniconified? A good thing to do is bind:

*FvwmIconBoxMouse       3       Click           Module FvwmIdent

in your .fvwm2rc and then clicking the third mouse button on a window in the
manager runs FvwmIdent on it. 

I haven't tested this code too thoroughly (ie, I don't use it in real life, so
I've only tested it with xterms changing their icon and title names), but I
can't reproduce this behavior.

Also, ouy of curiosity, what the "unpleasant behavior" that results when this
news program is listed in the manager?

Has anyone noticed strange problems with fvwm95 in that if too many sessi=
ons
are opened up the taskbar goes crazy and hogs all the CPU? The taskbar
has to be killed then everything seems back to normal.
Or the other thing that can happen is that if there are a lot of sessions=
 =

opening another xterm or whatever via either a button or the menu causes =

the window manager to crash, consequently logging you out...

Some patches might be nice...I dont have time to debug the problem myself=

Yep. I noticed the first problem - the taskbar grabbing all the CPU. I
solved it by enlarging the taskbar before adding a lot of windows. I
think there is also a way of preventing certain windows from being
represented in the taskbar - haven't tried that yet. 

Is there anyway to get the taskbar to start expanded (more than one
line high ) ?


I've also had the whole window manager crash, but I haven't been able
to figure out under what circumstances.

The files are probably still in the Incoming directory.

Genscheme 1.0 is a small package designed to aid you in the otherwise
tedious task of converting your Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 color
schemes to a suitable format for your Linux box.

Sample templates are included for both fvwm2, fvwm95-2 and some
resources (although fvwm95-2 works currently works a bit better for
now, for obvious reasons).  You can convert a single scheme or all
schemes.  Since it is a first release, it should be considered "beta"
quality.

RPMs should also be available where the .tar files are as well (see
below).

Title:		genscheme - Windows 95/NT 4 (TM) color scheme to Un*x translator
Version:	1.0
Entered-date:	12/26/96
Keywords:       X11 color scheme Windows translate fvwm2 fvwm95
Description:	Genscheme is a package which helps you migrate color
                schemes from Windows 95 (TM) and Windows NT (TM) to Un*x. 
                You must have Perl version 5, the m4 preprocessor,
                and access to those operating systems (to retrieve the
                color schemes).

This is primarily directed at those users who use fvwm-2.0.43 and a
recent version of XEmacs -- 19.14 or the latest 19.15 beta release.

Right now, I'm mainly interested in determining if anyone else can
verify this (or similar) lossage on another machine using fvwm-2.0.43
and XEmacs-19.1[45] and Gnus-5.

In the above scenario, no. But if I let Gnus get to the point where it
shows it's splash screen (with the yellowish Gnu animal), and then
switch desktops, I'm OK.

Yes. If I switch desktops in fvwm while the window is blank, I come
back to a blank window. But if I wait for the splash screen, as
described above, switch desktops and then come back I see the *Group*
buffer displayed. I don't believe this semi-win happens in
19.14. Perhaps the rest of the problem is in fact a bug in the fvwm
window manager. I'll try to grab olvwm and build it later to test this
out.

When I try to run "xmkmf;make Makefile" command when installing fvwm
I get a message saying the directory or file called Imake.tmpl does
not exist. Do I have to create that file or directory or is it supposed
to be there after untarring the distribution? Any help would be great.

Please respond directly to fchuang@menlo-astro.wr.usgs.gov

Hello,

Here is a patch for FvwmBacker.  Its principal function is to allow
different animated backgrounds (eg xearth, xsnow, xroach) on different
desks.  In addition sets the appropriate background for the current
desktop when FvwmBacker is invoked rather than next time the desk is
changed, and it fixes a small bug that stopped the -solid
option working for me.

Is this the right place for the patch to find its way into 2.0.44?

Happy New Year,
Richard Everson.

  The FvwmBacker module provides functionality to change the background
  when changing desktops.  Any command can be executed to change the
! backgrounds.  The commands used to change the backgrounds must exit
! after changing the root window, (i.e. 'xv -root zzz.gif' does not,
! without the -quit option) otherwise FvwmBacker will hang.

  color without generating a system call to xsetroot. Only single word
  color names may be used.
  
+ If the optional keyword StartStop and an additional command
+ \fIsscommand\fP are specified, \fIsscommand\fP will be invoked the
+ first time \fIDeskNumber\fP becomes active; when it becomes inactive
+ \fIsscommand\fP will be stopped by sending it a STOP signal and it
+ will be restarted (with a SIGCONT) when the desk next becomes active.
+ This behaviour is designed to be used with programs such as xearth(1)
+ and xsnow(1) which continuously draw on the root window.  By using
+ StartStop commands you can have a different animation on each desktop.

! Desk 0 is plain steel-blue.  Xearth(1) runs on desk 1 and xsnow(1)
! runs on desk 2.  Each time desk 2 becomes active the background is
! reset to midnight-blue because xsnow does not redraw the background
! when it is restarted.  Similarly desk 3 has roaches running around on
! a background of background2.xpm pixmaps; xpmroot is rerun each time
! the desk is selected to redraw the background.
! .SH NOTES
! Version 1.0 of xearth redraws the root window every five minutes by
! default.  Thus you might have to wait five minutes after selecting a
! desk before the background is redrawn.  One solution to this problem
! is to ask xearth to update itself every few seconds (eg xearth -wait
! 5), but this is clearly wasteful and will chew up noticable amounts of
! CPU time.   An alternative is to apply a patch to xearth (supplied
! with FvwmBacker) so that xearth updates itself each time it is sent a
! SIGCONT.  The patch has been sent to Kirk Lauritz Johnson and I hope
! will find its way into later releases of the xearth.

Yes, soon.  Illnesses and the holidays have delayed it some more, but
I hope to get the alpha version to the workers list in a few days,
then the beta version out to everyone else shortly after that.

Many people have reported seening things like this with various XEmacs
versions under fvwm (although I don't think I've ever really noticed
and I use XEmacs a lot, including the betas although I've really been
slipping as a beta tester due to lack of time).  I probably still have
some of the notes that were sent to the xemacs-beta list lying around
here somewhere...

I believe a few people reported seeing it under other virtual window
managers as well (tvtwm & ctwm?) which leads me to believe that it's
not really a problem with fvwm (although that wouldn't overly suprise
me either).

Let me know if you can or can't reproduce it with olvwm (or tvtwm or
ctwm).  I'll try to reproduce it again as well, when I get a chance.

FWIW (probably not much) I can't reproduce it using CDE-1.0.2. After
Gnus-5 was done loading and ready to display the *Group* buffer, it
(rudely) pops itself into my current workspace.

Of course, I don't really know CDE, so I was running with the
equivalent of ClickToFocus and w/o SkipMapping and SloppyFocus (my
normal XEmacs styles).

I'll try to build olvwm and see if it works there as well.

I use the border color to differentiate applications.  I would like to be
able to selectively apply the highlight color to only a part of the window border.

I would like to see a 3rd argument to HilightColor which specifies the
portions of the border that are subject to highlighting.

I suggest FST syntax like that used for mouse bindings.

    F	frame is highlighted
    S	sides are highlighted
    T	title bar is highlighted

I would also like this same convention for StickyColor (which can be snagged
from fvwm95) to be integrated into the main branch of fvwm2.

Example:

    # most borders are LIGHT GREY
    Style "*"           Color Black/#c0c0c0

    # netscape gets PURPLE borders
    Style "Netscape"    Color Black/#9970bb

    # emacs gets DEEP PINK borders
    Style "emacs"       Color Black/#cc3077

    # window with focus has LIGHT BLUE title bar with normal frame and side
    # colors
    HilightColor   Black #40a0c0 T


Maybe I'll have time to do this in the next week or so...  But, hopefully
I've just successfully managed to infect someone else who has more free
time with the same bright idea...  ;)

Hello,

I'm using fvwm 2.0.43, compiled on an HPUX 9.05 station using the
libraries for X11R6.1. My Xpm lib is 3.4g. For some reason, no matter
what i do, I can't get iconized windows to use pixmaps instead of
bitmaps. I tried changing the paths, adding a slash at the end of the
name, etc. It works with bitmaps but I can't get pixmaps to work and I
don't know why. I'm guessing it could be a colormap problem but I'm not
sure how to verify this. Xv brings up the pixmaps with no problem. I'm
really at my wits' ends.

If it matters any, I generate my rc file using the latest version of
the Dotfile Generator. I'm cc'ing this to that list in case the problem
lies there.

Any help on how I can go about debugging this would be gratly
appreciated.

TIA.

P.S. Please reply directly to me. I know it's bad netiquette to do
this, but I'm not subscribed to the fvwm list because the volume is
much too large. I looked in the archives but didn't find anything
(although after a while, things became pretty blurry...).

For the record, iconizing programs which have built-in color icons
works properly (tgif, netscape are the two I know about).

Which path are you using? In order to use full colour pixmaps your pixmap
path must be set (the pixmap icons don't go in the IconPath). I mention
this because when I first saw it in FVWM it seemed slightly illogical.
There IS a reason of course but putting pixmaps in the IconPath won't
work.

So the PixmapPath should look like this:

PixmapPath /usr/X11/include/X11/pixmaps/:/usr/local/icons

Or wherever you keep your pixmaps.

BTW it's not really bad netiquette to use private email - most lists I've
seen, the replies go to both sender and list. Every so often I've seen
complaints, because this results in duplicate copies, but I doubt it will
change. Some people get annoyed when people ask for private email replies
on USENEt, which personally I've never understood, because USENET is a
heck of a lot less reliable than mailing lists. 

Good luck

Aha! Bingo! Didier Nghia Le Tien also pointed out the same thing to me
but I didn't realize what he was talking about until now. I didn't know
you had to have an IconPath *and* a pixmap path. So it ended up being a
problem with the dotfile generator (which doesn't support PixmapPath
for some reason), not fvwm or me (well, inasmuch that I haven't yet read
the manpage from a-z, which make me unaware of these little details ;P).

Thanks Alexis and all the others who helped me out so quickly.

No offense folks, but this is utterly insane:

>{
>  int c1,c2;
>  int n,n2;
>
>  n=strlen(s1);
>  n2=strlen(s2);
>  if(n!=n2)

Oh, I see, so we don't preserve the >=< --> -1,0,1 semantics of strcmp,
we just return 0/non-zero.

What nonsense is this?
	c1 = tolower(c1);
is almost certainly faster, and certainly less ASCII-dependant, and more
readable.

>      if (isupper(c2)) 
>	c2 = 'a' - 1 + (c2 & 31);

Why bother?  This is absolutely no different from
	--n;
	++s1;
	++s2;

and, given the context, why on earth aren't these the body of the for loop?

Perhaps something more like
	while (*s1 && tolower(*s1) == tolower(*s2)) {
		++s1;
		++s2;
	}
	if (*tolower(s1) < *tolower(s2))
		return -1;
	if (*tolower(s2) > *tolower(s2))
		return 1;
	return 0;

would have worked?

I'm sorry, I'm just easily offended by gratuitous cruft, and I seem to
recall that this function turned out not to work with some set of compiler
options last time I tried to build fvwm-2.x.

As a general rule, you may safely assume that the <ctype.h> macros and
functions will be using fast lookup tables, and you will not be able
to outperform them without significant effort; unless the usage is inside
a *very* time-critical, heavily-used, routine, it is pretty much guaranteed
you cannot justify the time spent trying to beat them, least of all using
strange macros based on ASCII values.

Among other things, the '&31' is completely superfluous if you've already
guaranteed that the letter is uppercase; you can just use "c1 - 'A' + 'a'"
on ASCII machines, and gee, it's *still* slower than tolower.

While I'm griping, fvwm.c declares main incorrectly; main has returned an
int in C since 1972, and I can assure you, we on the committee have no
intent of changing this.  Compilers are free to reject declarations of
main with any other return type, and are encouraged to do so.

(It is a very nice window manager, I just don't think the code is as clean
as it should be.)

If you want the button to do anything fancy, then the easiest solution
is writing a small X application that gets swallowed in the
fvwmbuttons bar. If you need sample code, then feel free to contact me
and I will send you a copy of my "isdnbutton" code. This is a small
application that displays some status information, reacts to various
mouse clicks and handles a popup menu. It also deals with the problem
of being a setuid-root application, but you can probably discard that
part of the code. In order to be highly portable, it is written in C
and uses the Athena widget set.
