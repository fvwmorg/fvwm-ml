Hmm.  Someone will have to look at this.  We do test the various

What would be perfect is if you could submit a bug to our online bug
database at http://www.fvwm.org/cgi-bin/fvwm-bug including a context or
unified diff of the changes you made to get this working?

It should have, yes, but since none of us actually has a system with no

I don't have an HP system, but from these errors I'd say offhand that
the "cc" that comes with HP is an older, K&R C compiler and doesn't
understand ANSI/ISO standard C.  Fvwm requires a standard C compiler, it
won't work with old K&R C compilers.  The standard was ratified in 1989,
10 years ago, so this wouldn't seem to be a huge restriction... but
there you go.

Just continue to use gcc.

Try using (NoClose,UseOld) I know that works for me although it should
work either way we'll need to take a look at the parsing if this is the
problem.

Hi,
	I tried compiling fvwm-2.2 and noticed that it still produces the 
binary named fvwm2. The name was understandable while version 2 was still
in beta, but now that an official version has been released why not revert 
back to the good old "fvwm" ?

Because lots of places have users still using fvwm1 and expect that when
they put "fvwm" in a script, they get something that works with all of
their old config files.  Since fvwm2 is incompatible with the old syntax,
it must have a different name.

We (the fvwm-workers) will probably at some point introduce a configure
flag to install it as just "fvwm".

Nope. That doesn't work for me either.

I still get multiple instances of xclocks and other things that
were swallowed and specified with (NoClose,UseOld).

Maybe I have too many things in my container to be unswallowed in time.

Hi,

I'm using 2.1.5 and I would like to use WarpToWindow in the
following way :

AddToFunc WarpFocusRun
+       "I"     Next [$0 CirculateHit] echo $w
+       "I"     Next [$0 CirculateHit] WindowId $w WarpToWindow 80 80
+       "I" None [$0] $1


The goal would have been to warp the pointer on a window
given it's name, but of course it doesn't work because $w
expands to the ID of the incoming window, not to the ID
of the window that matches the condition.

Any hint ?

I thought of getting the window id by something like :

Exec xwininfo -name $0 | awk '/^x/{print $4}'

but then I don't know how to get the result in a
variable that I could use in WindowID ... WarpToWindow.

Thanks,
Stephane

How about:

AddToFunc WarpFocusRun \

Hi

I've noticed that SnapAttraction doesn't affect the resizing of windows.
Not a huge issue, but it would be rather handy if resizes could snap to
other objects on the desktop...

Cheers
Koos

OK... AFACT, in order to be able to pass the mouse between your two screens on 
Solaris, you must have the following entry in /usr/dt/config/Xservers:

:0   Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun -dev /dev/fb0:/dev/fb1 

which says that the X server should control both displays, and allow mouse 
passthrough.  You may list more screens than this (I believe Solaris supports 
as many as you have slots for video cards), and they will allow horizontal 
passthrough in the order listed.

The other way to list multiple screens is to give a -dev argument for each 
screen, but this does not allow mouse passthrough.

I've just now started tackling how to configure fvwm2 to deal with both 
screens, so more as news breaks, but so far I seem to be running completely 
seperate instances of fvwm in each screen, which do not know about one 
another, and I don't seem to be able to pass windows back and forth at all.

I'm running Solaris 7 (nee 2.7) on an Ultra 1, with two crappy 8-bit displays; 
fvwm version 2.2

Hope this helps...

Hello all,

Can somebody tell me why in the next configuration in my button-bar a
buttonpress doesn't work:


*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow "xload" "Exec exec xload" \ 
  Action (Mouse 1) "Exec exec xosview -cua0 -net 200 -ul
-l                        -geometry 325x325", \
  Action (Mouse 2) "Exec exec xcpustate -interval 1
-bg                           "#a4978e" -fg black", \  
  Action (Mouse 3) "Exec exec /usr/local/bin/rxvt -fg
khaki                       -bg darkolivegreen \
                        -fat -n top -T Top -7 -e top" )
*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow "xbiff" "Exec exec xbiff -bg SlateGray3 -fg
black -update 60", \
                           -file ~/Mail/inbox/Inbox", \
  Action (Mouse 1) "Exec exec from | xmessage -file ~/Mail/inbox/Inbox"
)

Thanks for the reaction,

Hello,

This is Cobalt from over at fvwm.themes.org.  I am working on a new
method for fvwm themes.  This newer version has dynamic menus and
background switcher.  I have two questions.  First, is it possible to
have an Exec command and a Restart Fvwm2 command for the same menu item,
like "+ bleh Exec blah Restart Fvwm2"? If not, how would I accomplish
this same task.  I know that the preceding syntax is incorrect, as I
tried it.  The second is this:  Is it possible to have the menus changed
on the fly w/o a restart?  I am using PipeRead now to change menus,
however this is annoying because it takes a restart for the menus to
change.  I would like them to change whenever the menu is opened, if
that is possible.

Also, If anyone has suggestions of what features should go into this
themeing mechanism, please tell me, I would hate to put something on
fvwm.themes.org that was not the best.  Right now, it has dynamic (as
above) menus and theme switching, background switching and tarball
extraction.. also, it sports a better way of organization.

Thanks,
John Anderson (Cobalt)

Can't you write a function that contains these two commands, then
execute that for the menu item?

No, I don't think that's possible.  Fvwm doesn't provide any "hook" when
a menu is opened where you could insert an action.

However, you don't need a restart; I modify menus all the time without
restarting.  For example, I put a "*Rescan*" menu item on the menu that
does a PipeRead; the trick is that the first command read should be a
DestroyMenu to get rid of the old menu, otherwise you'll get the info
duplicated.

I've done linux for years.  I found that the fvwm2 was a pain with what
I call the dumb 95 bar at the bottom that wasted screen area.  So I've
used the original fvwm that uses a .fvwmrc  It seems that the original
fvwm has no official web page as the official FVWM web page is fvwm2.  I
tried using fvwm2 and could not figure out how to get rid of the tribute
to Microsoft 95 bar at the bottom of my screen.  Also I like to use 10
1x1 desktops so I can label each and swallow into the botton bar.  I've
tried editing a fvwm2rc and did not have much luck.

This will show you how I configure fvwm and has a link to my fvwmrc.

Anyway could you point me to someone who knows...

Thanx Tom Watson

Fvwm and fvwm2 are basically the same thing. The older version 1 (fvwm)
is not actively developed, distributed or supported anymore. A few days
ago we had the first release of version 2 (i.e. stable, non-beta release).
Please check our web site:

  http://www.fvwm.org/

I assume that you were using fvwm95 (a $%^*#@ 95 like spawn of fvwm2)
since you got this task bar by default. In fvwm2 itself this is
called FvwmTaskBar and is started in your .fvwm2rc with something like this:

  Module FvwmTaskBar

Removing this line will remove the task bar.

For your desktop dimension you put this command in the .fvwm2rc:

  DesktopSize 1x1

And swallow a FvwmPager module in your FvwmButtons bar. Basically
you have to start the pager with

  Module FvwmPager 0 9

which tells the pager to display the desks 0-9. Please check the
manpage for FvwmPager for details. If you need further assistance
I can send you an example.

Bye

Dominik

Personally I would have guessed he's got the 'AnotherLevel' Redhat
munged setup which complicates things even more ...

You'd have to mess around with your .Xclients and .xinitrc etc. to get
things to work sanely, or at least that's what I think I had to do ...

Every now and then I think about putting together a themes managment
package for fvwm2. I've disliked most of the approaches I've seen
other take for this. What some folks call a "theme" is really just
window border and menu decorations; other times, a "theme" is a
complete desktop look and feel.

One thing I've been trying to do lately is isolate the individual
components of my desktop configuration into separate files. What I'm
shooting for is a "plugin" concept that wraps a defined configuration
to implement something useful in a particular module.  For an example,
see my configuration (http://osiris.kosmic.org/~jim/); I've
implemented a "wharf" using FvwmButtons, and a "taskbar" using
FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, and FvwmIconMan. The goal here is for each of
these "plugins" to be self-contained; adding one to a fvwm2
configuration should be as easy as putting "Read <filename>" in
.fvwm2rc.

Ultimately, the narrower "decor only" definition of a "theme" could be 
implemented in a similar "plugin" fashion.

Hi all, 

I just upgraded my X11 server to R6.4. I also just upgraded my fvwm to 2.2. I
also run on Solaris 2.5.1 (if it ever has an effect).

My question is this:

When I click the root window (to get the "Utilities" menu say), it pops up
ok. Note that I click and release the button x. Now if I click and release on a
submenu entry, it pops up ok BUT the parent menu disappear. If I change my mind 
I cannot go back to the parent and must re-click the root menu to get the menu
again. It's annoying.

Does anybody have any idea why that is? I checked with fvwm2.0.45 and it does
the same thing when I know that running it above X11R5 (the stock X11 server
with Solaris 2.5.1) worked fine. I know it may be an X11R6 question but Im
asking just in case somebody could help me.

Thanks a lot in advance for your great help

That's because it is coded this way inside fvwm. I can't image why this should
depend on the X11 revision, but if it works differently with X11R5 then it's
a bug (with X11R5, not X11R6). Usually submenus are popped up automatically so
you don't have to click to open it (assuming that you use the 'Popup' builtin
for the submenus, not 'Menu'). I see that this is a problem when you have
turned off automatic popup explicitly (which I will probably fix with another
option when I've go the time).

Could you please post your MenuStyle lines so I can judge what exactly
you are trying to achieve?

Bye

Dominik

I'd try making a function for it...

DestroyFunc "Funky-Restart"
AddToFunc "Funky-Restart"
+ "I"   Exec $0
+ "I"   Restart fvwm2

Again, try a function to do this:

DestroyFunc "Refresh-and-Popup"
AddToFunc "Refresh-and-Popup"
+ "I"   Piperead $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
+ "I"   Popup $0

Mouse 1 R A Refresh-and-Popup UtilitiesMenu /usr/local/bin/UtilMenuPipe

The "UtilMenuPipe" program would output commands to destroy and then
recreate the "UtilitiesMenu".  It will need to update all dynamic items
accessible from that menu, though, since sub-menus can't have commands
attached to them like mouse clicks can.

One "feature" I'd love to see is the ability to configure whether background
images are part of the "theme".  I personally dislike having the two
connected, but a lot of people disagree.  About the closest I get to
including a background with a theme is doing an optional "Exec bkgd green"
when switching to a green-ish theme.  (my backgrounds are sorted by color,
and a green one would be randomly chosen)

Also, it'd be neat to have some sort of consistency between actions in
different themes.  So, keyboard (and most mouse) input might be better off
in a "fvwm-input" file instead of being included with each theme.  (but
titlebar button-actions would have to be in the theme, of course)

For theme switching, the easiest method I've found to switch on the fly is
to have each theme in a separate file, and access them through a menu
similar to this in my "fvwm-theme":

DestroyFunc ReadStyle
AddToFunc ReadStyle
# Restore the defaults
+       "I"     Read fvwm-theme.default
# Change the theme...
+       "I"     Read $0
# Restore the user's override settings...
+       "I"     Read .fvwm2rc.style
+       "I"     Recapture

DestroyMenu "NewTheme"
AddToMenu "NewTheme"
+ "Choose A New Theme"          Title
+ "&Pseudo"                     ReadStyle fvwm-theme.pseudo
+ "&Hazard"                     ReadStyle fvwm-theme.hazard
+ "&Granite"                    ReadStyle fvwm-theme.granite
...blablabla...

To add new themes to the collection, just add a line to this menu.  I also
add them to my "RandomTheme" function, so I'll get a different one each time
I log in.  It's also handy to have a "Read .fvwm2rc.theme" at the bottom of
the file so users can add their own customized stuff.  I make sure to do
this in each config file, since I'm defining the default configuration for
all my users, and everyone has different tastes.

Backgrounds can easily be handled by another dynamic menu.  I keep
backgrounds in /usr/local/lib/X11/backgrounds/ and $HOME/backgrounds/, and a
"bkgd" script uses these.  It's reasonably easy to convert a filesystem tree
into a menu structure with piperead, so the user can select a specific
background or an entire directory to pick one randomly.

If you're interested, the bkgd script is available on my page (below), and I
can send you my current (unfinished) fvwm2 setup.  (the one on my page is a
bit outdated now)

I have the following functions and bindings in my fvwm2rc:

AddToFunc Title-Bar-Fun
+	"M"	Move
+	"D"	WindowShade
+	"C"	Raise

AddToFunc Raise-unless-Move
+	"M"	Move
+	"C"	Raise

Mouse 1		T	5	Title-Bar-Fun
Mouse 1  	WSFI	5	Raise-unless-Move


The C option works in Raise-unless-Move but not in Title-Bar-Fun.
If I remove the D option from Title-Bar-Fun, it works fine.  It worked
fine in version 2.0.46.

I would appreciate it if someone else could test this to verify that
it is a bug.

Thanks,


Dan

No, that works in the current CVS source. What version are you using?
Not 2.1.10 by any chance? Mouse bindings are broken there. You should
use 2.2.0 if so. '5' seems to be an exotic modifier to me. Are you sure
you are pressing the right key?

Not to imply that anything good can come out of Redmond, the Win98
themes manager does allow selective opt-out of various aspects of each 
theme (sounds, mouse icons, fonts, colors, background, screen saver,
etc. That's what I was driving at with my blather about plugins; each
aspect of the theme should be loaded independently, so one could mix
and match.

Also, is FvwmBacker faster these days? Last time I played with it, it
was a dog...

If a theme sets icons for apps, there especially needs to be an
opt-out; anyone using an Icon Manager will want that.

I doubt he's clicking to open it.  I know when I click on a submenu it's
to post the submenu, just as you click and release to post the parent,
so that if my mouse slips down or off the menu somehow it doesn't
disappear; I do this a lot as an ease-of-use thing.

I agree that when the click started to post the new menu and delete the
parents I found that pretty disconcerting--I still wish it didn't do
that but I haven't been annoyed enough to file a bug about it.

Certainly no other menu system I know of behaves this way when submenus
are clicked...

Now that you say it: I don't use that because I don't like it either.
Nothing I can't chane with another MenuStyle option. How about
'ClickShowPopup' and 'ClickSelectPopup' with ClickShowPopup as the default?

Thanks all for your feedback.

Sure, one way around it would be not to use submenus in menus, but that's
rather limiting.  Like Paul said, I know no other WM that behaves this
way. Because of that, I guess that probably should be considered a bug, unless
it was an intentional feature (??).

I'm all for a new MenuStyle option that prevents ANY parent menu to disappear
when one of its submenu is clicked (and released) on.

I can't wait to hear more about it in the changes.log !!!!  HA ! lets put some
pressure now!!

Thanks again all for the great work.

If you knew how many open bugs and enhancement request I have on my
to-do list you wouldn't even bother to press me :-) But since I'm
mostly involved with menus it will probably take only a few days.

I like it except I wonder if we can't come up with a more descriptive
verb than "Select"; to me it's not obvious that this means "make this
popup the only menu".  Unfortunately I can't think of anything better.
Maybe "ClickForRootPopup" or something?

Of course, maybe we don't need an option?  Does anyone _prefer_ the
current behavior?  Maybe we should just change it back and have done.

I am using version 2.2, as indicated in the subject.  Guess I should have
added that in the body also.

5 is modifier 5, which I have bound to that useless Window's 95 key.
The C option does work, except for this one instance.  Perhaps they
didn't get everything fixed from version 2.1.10.

Did you try the bindings listed or did you just assume that I was an
idiot because you couldn't understand my message?  Why not try the
bindings for yourself, use another modifier if 5 is too exotic for
you.

I tracked down the bug.  When a function has double click actions single
clicks get the wrong type.  Below is a patch that fixes the bug.

Doh!  I responded to the wrong message.  This is the message I meant to 
respond to.

I tracked down the bug.  When a function has double click actions
single clicks get the wrong type.  Below (end of this message) is a

This problem has gone away.  I tracked down the /tmp/.wm_pid file to
workman.  I had F12 bound to send a command to workman.  I have no
idea what that has to do with F2, but everything is working fine now.

*shrug*

I believe this is "workman" complaining that you are trying to send a
signal of some sort to workman, but the main workman processes pid file
is missing.  This appears to be unrelated to the rest of the problem.

Note on some keyboards the F11 and F12 keys work like F1 and F2, by
default (this has been true on my Sun keyboards I've used, where F11 is
often bound to the "Stop" button on the left side keypad, and F12 is
bound to "Again").

Don't know if that's true for you or not but a short exploration with
xkeycaps might be in order...

Probably. But I'm sure someone is going to complain if we change
the behaviour.

But do duoble clicks still work with this fix? Looking at the code
I doubt it.

'Them' is me in this case :) I did fix the problem in 2.1.10 or
we wouldn't have released 2.2.

I used 'S' instead of '5' but otherwise just pasted the lines from
the mail into my .fvwm2rc. It worked perfectly well. BTW, I *never*
think of people who report bugs as idiots. I take 'customer'
satisfaction very seriously. If someone reports something one could
call 'stupid' we probably have a problem with our documentation. So
in the end it's almost always our fault. On the other hand I can only
guess if a reporter is an expert or newbie so I often ask questions
that may seem stupid in the other direction.

Hi all!

I found that key accelerators in menus works only while CAPS is off,
which is IMHO inproper. It's not a problem with modifiers but with
case which in this situaction should be ignored.

Yes, double clicks still work.  If you understand the code rather 
than just look at it, you will see that it should and does still work.

The problem with that is that the S modifier is broken.  Try the
former with C instead and you will see the problem that my patch
fixes.  Oh, one other thing that might come into play, I use
ClickToFocus, and I don't use the module to automatically raise
windows when they receive focus.

The following bindings illustrate the problem with the S modifier.

Mouse 1       T        C     Maximize
Mouse 1       T        S     Maximize

Holding control and pressing mouse button 1 in the title bar causes the
window to be maximized without being raised, as one would expect.  It
also does not give the window focus.

Holding shift and pressing mouse button 1 in the title bar causes the
window to be maximized but also raises the window and gives it focus.

Shift is the only modifier that works this way.  All the others work
as one would expect.

Hey, if *you* understand the code (I tried but I couldn't), can you
tell me what this ONE_AND_A_HALF_CLICKS thing was good for?

Really? Are you sure this isn't caused by some other binding in your
.fvwm2rc or by your xmodmap? Shift and control are treated exactly
the same in the code.

Just finished it.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Readme for awol's configuration package for Fvwm 2.2
#  last updated circa 10th March 1999
#  Website http://www.dove.net.au/~awol/fvwm2
#--------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains directories and files for the latest "stable"
release of the Fvwm window manager. Earlier versions of fvwm may
produce unpredictable results when used with this package.

All files are easily modifiable, and some have comments included
to assist the user. Not all. I'll keep adding to the TIPS file
as I think of them.

Most of this package has been "hacked" from other sources.
I've tried to keep the original author's name intact
where possible. If I've forgotten or erased anyone, it is
not intentional. Let me know, and I'll correct it.

I originally put this together in a fit of boredom, over a
couple of weeks last xmas. It may have lots of mistakes
and may screwup your system. Consider yourself pre-warned!
But then again.... it might work perfectly! (I hope it does.)
To gain all the features of this configuration the x server
must be started as root. All xterms must therefore have '-e login'
option appended.
The user should be able to easily change from my own customised
decor (the default), to Win95 decor, to Mwm decor, to AfterStep
decor, and now a new DrWho theme, by simple menu choices. More
decors will be added at some future date. Individual windows
can change decors just as easily. Backgrounds can be pre-defined
or entered "on the fly". Different sounds accompany different decors
using the builtin-rplay support in FvwmEvent. Some sample sounds
for this configuration are also available for download.

The whole configuration is section-ized (I dislike the term
modularised since it could be easily confused with Fvwm's modules),
and "Read"s extra configuration commands as needed.
Each decor has different Fvwm module configurations so button
bars change also. Menus likewise. Different sections are in
corresponding directories for easy modification.
I've only just started tidying this up, and since I only have
an old 486dx33 it may take some time to finish. Hopefully
I'll upgrade before the end of the year. Since I've only got
a resolution of 800x600 and 256 colors to work with, some settings
may need adjusting such as window sizing etc...

Feel free to email me with any problems you encounter.
I can't promise to have all the answers, but I'll give it a try.
Alternatively, the fvwm mailing-list is invaluable for advice
and help with difficulties. (fvwm@hpc.uh.edu)

At some stage I'll add to this and include MacOS and
enlightenment features and any others I like.
I hope you both enjoy AND find this package useful.

  I'm running 2.1.11 still, under Sparc/Solaris 2.4.

  Basically: with windows popped up from our GUI builder, I can't perform
any fvwm operations. E.g., I have <Meta+menu> defined to always give the
window control menu, but these windows don't do it; the <Front> key also
fails to function. If I run 'move' with no parameter, I just get a beep
when selecting one of the windows.

  I'm guessing there's a hint/property on these windows that I've somehow
got fvwm obeying, but I can't see what fvwm Hints options to change that
I've not tried already. Here's the output of xprop on one:

WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
                Client accepts input or input focus: True
WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW
WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):

                program specified maximum aspect ratio: 97/129
WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "gdd_top"
WM_NAME(STRING) = "UAT - GDD"

  ... and here's a bit of my config:

Style "*"  BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4
Style "*"  Icon unknown1.xpm
Style "*"  MWMDecor, OLDecor, HintOverride
Style "*"  DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"  SloppyFocus, SkipMapping
Style "*"  RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
Style "*"  UseStyle DoodleButtonsMin

  Any ideas anyone?

The problem was reported in a previous message: the fact that keyboard
accelerators are case-sensitive.  On the one hand this seems like a good
thing, as it gives you more possible accelerators; on the other hand it's
a drag that you have to change the case of your description to fit the
case of your accelerator, and maybe it should be ignored.

If the section of code with the ONE_AND_A_HALF_CLICKS in it were removed,
a single click would register as a double click.  It seems that either
two ButtonPress events are on the stack for a single press, or that the
ButtonPress event for the first press doesn't get removed.  The first
seems more likely.  Either way, the ONE_AND_A_HALF_CLICKS is there
to purge an extra event from the event queue.  The *correct* way to
fix this would be to figure out why the event queue isn't doing
what we would expect, and fix that first.

Unfortunately, yes.  I just removed all other mouse bindings and
checked it.  I suspect that the problem is in the ClickToFocus code
rather than the function calling code.   I don't use any S modifiers
so it doesn't really bother me.  I noticed it while testing the click
double-click thing.

I just re-read the code.  The problem is that the ButtonPress from the
first press is never taken off the event queue.  I will write a new
patch to fix this correctly.

Here is the fix I promised.  Please disregard the previous patch, as
this one replaces that one.  If you already applied the other one,
un-apply it.

Ah, *this* mail. I'll apply the patch. Shortcuts were supposed to be case
insensitive anyway.

Thanks! We were trying to figure out what this 1 1/2 click thing
was good for but never had thought of this. The funny thing is that
you can even put an 'O' in a function (not that it works, but anyway).

Yes, I could confirm this at home. I'll look into it when I have
the time.

I've read a few postings where people have asked for Fvwm themes.
Since people have been asking for features in their configurations that
don't seem to be available
on any of the "themes sites" (I may be wrong) I've been working on my
own. Newly posted is...

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Website http://dove.mtx.net.au/~awol/fvwm2
#  Available files
#  awols-config0.2b.tar.gz - awols-icons.tar.gz
#  awols-sounds.tar.gz - drwho-sounds.tar.gz
#--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm still building this, but there is now a menu option to start a
FvwmForm module to change sound
configs without restarting fvwm2 itself. As well as the ability to
change whole decors or individual
window decors by menu selection. Currently 5 decors are available. There
may be lots of
unintentional mistakes in this package, as I'm just a learner, any
suggestions or helpful comments
would be appreciated. Just email me.
New features will be added as I find time.

Actually, you could pop the first press off the queue, and leave the
ONE_AND_A_HALF_CLICKS code in there.  Then O would work and be
*slightly* different from D.  There isn't anything in the docs about O
and the intent of the code seems to be to get double clicks working.
I don't see any need for distinguising between 1 1/2 clicks and 2
clicks, but it could be done.

Sure, but I don't see a use for it.

Hey there!
Is there a way to make a program (in this case realplayer) start sticky 
and iconified... I like to get it to follow me around and get 
deiconified on the page/desk I'm currently on so that I conveniently can 
change volume/clip etc etc.

I checked out the FAQ but my eyes are so tired of staring the monitor all 
day so I couldn't find it x-P

Anyway, if someone can help me I'd really appreciate it...

Sure! Just put --->  Style "rvplayer"  StartsIconic, StickyIcon
into a line in your .fvwm2rc file.

Or you could always get fxvolume for a separate volume control slider.
I've got it at my site on http://dove.mtx.net.au/~awol/fvwm2
While you're at it, my configuration package there has the volume control
built into the main button bar. Follows you wherever you go!  :)

Quoting Neil Bird (neil.bird@rrds.co.uk):
>   Any ideas anyone?

The behaviour you describe is consistent with the application making its
windows "unmanaged". If they don't appear in the WindowList menu, that would
confirm this. FVWM can't "see" unmanaged windows, so can't do anything with
them. Why the app would be doing this, I don't know (very few apps do), but
if it is the case, it can only be fixed in the app.

I'm using fvwm2 as setup by RedHat 5.1, i.e. fvwm2.0.46, i.e. not the
latest greatest version.  So the answer may be in part that I should
get 2.2, which would be fine...

Anyway, they bind
	Key Tab A M Next [CurrentScreen *] Focus

which is fine, but what I would like is
	Key Tab A M Next [CurrentScreen *] Focus-and-Raise

except that the latter is not a primitive, and my attempts to create
a user-defined function for the purpose have failed (tending merely
to turn Alt/Tab into a no-op).

Is this possible?  I don't really want auto-raising, because occasionally
I may want to have focus in a partially obscured window.

  thanks,
  Phil

Hello,

 I've compiled fvwm-2.2 with gcc on a Sun Sparc 5 running Solaris 2.5.1.

 When I try to get an xterm to act as a console, I get an error:

$ xterm -C&
xterm: Console redirection failed


 Anyone have any suggestions on what might be causing this and how to fix it?
I spent an hour or so poking around in the list archives, but didn't come up
with anything that seemed to cover this.

	Regards,

		Monte Freeman

 I would have thought the same thing. However, if I run olwm, twm, or mwm and
issue the same "xterm -C&" command it works just fine...

Hmm.  Well, are you starting some other app in your .fvwm2rc file that
might be grabbing the console, like xconsole or similar, that doesn't
get started under the other WMs?

That's about all I can think of... BTW, xterm -C works fine for me under
fvwm 2.2 :-/.

Hi,

I had the same problem some time ago but with an other WM. It occured when
/dev/console belonged to root or someone else and the access rights didn't allow
me to write on it.

Check if either /dev/console belongs too you or at least its access right are
rwxrwxrwx (or 777 if you prefere).

To validate if this is your problem try to execute:
	echo "this is a test" > /dev/console
If you have an error message it means you are not allow to access the console.
Try to find who is using the console!

Regards,
Patrice.

  Thanks. You're right, it doesn't appear in the WindowList.

  Trouble is, the windows are created automatically by the GUI builder we
use. I'll have to see if I can bodge around it ...

Talking about Alt_Tab functions:
I wanted to switch between pages on my screen and get activated last
active window on that page. Also I wanted Alt_Tab and Alt_ShiftTab keys
to work only within current page without messing with order of windows
placed not on acive page/desk. Module FvwmButtons is placed on every page.

Below is my solution:

AddToFunc RaiseFocus            "I" Raise
+                               "I" Focus

AddToFunc RaiseFlip             "I" Raise
+                               "I" FlipFocus

AddToFunc NextFlip "I" Next (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) RaiseFlip

AddToFunc PrevFlip "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) RaiseFocus

AddToFunc last_active "I" \ 
 Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage CirculateHit FvwmButtons) FlipFocus
+ "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

AddToFunc scroll_rt     "I"     Scroll  100     0
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

AddToFunc scroll_lt     "I"     Scroll  -100    0
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

AddToFunc scroll_dn     "I"     Scroll  0       100
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

AddToFunc scroll_up     "I"     Scroll  0       -100
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

Key Left        A       1       scroll_lt
Key Right       A       1       scroll_rt
Key Up          A       1       scroll_up
Key Down        A       1       scroll_dn

Key Escape      A       1       WindowList \ 
 Root c c "Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !iconic) RaiseFlip"

Key Tab         A       1       Function PrevFlip
Key Tab         A       S1      Function NextFlip

I'am testing this now.
It seems quite useable.

Yes.
Add "ColorLimit 99" as the first line of your .fvwm2rc file.
Don't use gradients for window or menu decoration.

I've recently switched from fvwm 2.1.6 to fvwm 2.2.  My menus are no longer
animated.  ie.  when a submenu appears near the edge of the screen the menu
doesn't slide over the make more room.  It appears that animation doesn't work
unless the second argument to popupoffset is >=100.  For example

menustyle * popupoffset 0 67, Animation      # no animation
menustyle * popupoffset 0 100, Animation     # yes animation
menustyle * popupoffset 50 99, Animation     # no animation

animation should occur whenever the menus overlap more than
the popupoffset suggests. E.g. with '0 67' the parent menu
should be animated away if the overlap if bigger than 33%
(wich doesn't occur normally), give or take a few pixels.

Doesn't it do that?

  I just had a thought about this: olwm (& olvwm, & twm I believe) allowed
these windows, if not to be resized (and maybe moved), to be raised &
lowered with a key press.

  Why not fvwm? What's different?

I don't really know what that console stuff is about, but I can start
"xterm -C" without problems on my system (i386, linux-2.0.34, RH5.1,
fvwm-2.2), though I don't see any difference with a regular xterm.
Echoing to /dev/console doesn't work, since it has permissions set to
600, and xconsole can't grab the console either.

Am I missing something important?

Not for me.  If I have the first menu against the right edge of the screen the
second popup will overlap it almost completely.  But no animation, even if I
set it to '0 99', which should mean the overlap only has to be 1%.

I might do that when I find the time. Installing is as simple as
unpacking it, change to the new .fvwm2/ directory, and run the makelinks.sh
script.
All the user has to do then is check the ModulePath, IconPath etc..., in the
new .fvwm2/.fvwm2rc file. The README describes it all.

<snip>

I'd never been able to get that FvwmConf module to work satisfactorily,
so I downloaded the latest version posted at the above link and tried it out
again. It still doesn't work. Probably not with Fvwm 2.2 but maybe it's me.
If anyone can tell me how to get it working with the latest "stable" Fvwm 2.2
let me know. Until then I'll keep working on mine.
FvwmConf is a module, mine is a complete set of rc files for fvwm2
configuration.
My package (so far) only has 5 decors. Contributions and suggestions
would be welcome. It is not necessary to restart fvwm2 to change decors.
Each decor can be selected via menu. Individual windows can be assigned
different decors by menu selection also.
Different module configurations are loaded for each decor.
FvwmEvent configs can now be changed "on the fly". (without restarting fvwm2)
You can even specify an FvwmEvent config file to load and use. (e.g. change to
a config with debug commands!)
Individual FvwmEvents "events" can also be changed. (not fully tested yet)
Andrew Laden contributed a Resize Desktop routine to alter number of pages
per desk. (eg 2x2 -> 5x5) Nice!
Backgrounds can be changed by input with the full path to the file.
I'm planning many more features, but it all takes time.
There's probably still a lot of bugs I have to find but I'm learning.
Hope this explains more.

Alex

P.S. For those who came in late, my package is at

OK, right. I've fixed it in 2.3.x. Could somebody apply this to
2.2.1 too, please? You have to change this line in menus.c
(DoMenusOverlap)

      prior_width *= mr->ms->feel.PopupOffsetPercent / 100;

to this:

      prior_width *= (float)(mr->ms->feel.PopupOffsetPercent) / 100.0;

Hello,
    I've just installed fvwm2 on my SPARC20.  I have a problem with
system log messages popping up on the desktop which causes everything to
scroll up.  I've redirected standard error to /dev/null when starting
fvwm but this only stops some of the messages.  Other things like failed
remote logins into my workstation and error messages from applications
like Netscape also appear.  I've even edited the syslog.conf file to
output everything from /dev/console /dev/null but that didn't seem to
work.

  Try having 'xterm -C' as the first thing to start up.

  I always do, in my .xinitrc:

# Start fvwm2
sleep 10 & pid=$!
fvwm2 &

.. other stuff

wait $pid

if [ -x $HOME/usr/fvwm2/login ]; then
    $HOME/usr/fvwm2/login               # Custom FVWM2 tools
else
    $OPENWINHOME/lib/openwin-init       # Default OpenWindows tools
fi


  ... and in the login script, kick off X tools that I only want run once
at login time (like netscape/xterms, etc. (as opposed to fvwm's Init
function which runs things every restart). 'xterm -C' is the first thing
it does, and that'll catch your console stuff. Pass in a nice small
geometry & iconise the thing if you don't care about it much.

Is there any way in the latest fvwm to use styles to have autoraise

No.

Not yet?

We're out of flags in the internal fvwm structures for new styles; one
of the goals of the next version is the GSFR (Great Style Flag Rewrite)
which will change these structures to avoid the current limit.
Customizing focus on a per window basis is often used as an argument for
the new feature (not like it needs one).

However, I'm not entirely sure how this will work in your case, since
autoraise is actually implemented via a module, not by fvwm proper.
People more knowledgeable than I on these subjects will have to
comment.

Hi,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(current .Xmodmap and output of 'xmodmap -pke' are in attachment 1)
My setup is:
  Linux RedHat 5.0 for intel -- 2.0.31 kernel
  XFree86 3.3
  fvwm 2.0.46
  vim 5.3 running on xterms 
------------------------------------------------------------------------



The plan is that i would like to use keys F20-F29 in fvwm to do mappings 
like the following:
	Key F20     A   A  Popup "Utilities"
	Key F21     A   A  WindowList

To achieve that, I want to use the windoz keys in my keyboard as modifiers.
(i have already placed them as osf keys in my xmodmap keycode table)

Thus, I would like to produce keys F20-F29 by typing (for example)
    osfSelect + a
    osfSelect + b
	...

The modifier map follows:

	xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

	shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
	lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
	control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
	mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
	mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
	mod3        
	mod4
	mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

To be honest, in spite of reading the man page and a couple of HOW TO's,
i still don't have a very good grasp of how the modifiers work.  

The only thing that i know is that Alt-<char> currently gives the 
corresponding char with the high bit set.  And since i use those Meta's 
in my editor (vim), i would not want to change how that works.

[i say that because I see that Alt is my modifier 1 up above]

any help and enlightment will be appreciated... 

- josin

What about Style "Netscape" ClickToFocus

  Can this kind of be done with FvwmEvent? Possibly not, since it can't
yet pass the ID of the event-generating-window into functions ...

	+                         "I" Raise

and

	Key Tab A M Next [CurrentScreen *] Focus-and-Raise

did work, but only when the AddToFunc command was given as part of
the starting configuration: I had been trying to issue it via the
Fvwm Command "talk box", and this for some reason would not work.

	Short answer:  presently, no.

	Longer answer:  maybe, or maybe later.

	Someone suggested trying the ClickToFocus style. This depends on how
you use your desktop. If you view the focusing and raising of windows as
one indivisible action, instead of two discrete ones, it might give you
an approximation of what you're looking for. The windows to which you
give the ClickToFocus style will not be automatically raised when the
mouse cursor rests over them; they also will not be automatically given
focus - you will have to click them to focus and raise them.

	If you want certain windows to be given focus but not raised when the
mouse cursor is over them, and other windows to be both focused and
autoraised, then you're out of luck, for now.

	To implement the latter would require adding an additional style, which
can't be done till after the Great Style Flag Rewrite (GSFR). It would
also require one of a) a modification to the module interface, or b) a
new core FVWM command like AutoRaise (raise this window only if it has
the AutoRaise style). I would opt for approach b.

	Would you mind entering a request for this feature into the FVWM bug
tracking system, so it doesn't fall through the cracks?

Well, it is not style but running this script with FvwmCommand should
do the job.

Make sure you kill FvwmAuto, run FvwmCommandS, and place FvwmCommand
in your command path.

Invoke, from a shell, something like,

perl selectable-raise.pl '(XTerm|Eterm|Netscape)' 0.4

I don't know. I've only run across apps with unmanaged windows a couple of
times, and apart from thinking "ah, that's interesting", never gave it much
investigation. Perhaps someone who's done more X programming would care to
comment?

Phil,

Just for future refrence Talk and Console send individual commands to
fvwm and fvwm has no way of connecting them to getthe above working in
Talk you could:
AddToFunc Focus-and-Raise "I" Focus
AddToFunc Focus-and-Raise "I" Raise
Key Tab A M Next [CurrentScreen *] Focus-and-Raise
recapture

the recapture is just for good measure new Keybindings generally require
a recapture to get picked up by exisitng windows.

well, 

i found a way to achieve what i wanted in regards to fvwm.  Looking 
thru the fvwm archives, i found a msg from 1996, from Andrew Eskilsson,
mentioning that fvwm will recognize a modifier which has been added 
thru xmodmap.

thus, now i have in my .Xmodmap:

  ! ADD MODIFIERS FOR FVWM...
  add mod3 = osfSelect
  

and in fvwm2rc.keys:

  Key g     A   3  Prev [!Visible *] FlipFocusAndWarp
  Key l     A   3  Next [CurrentScreen *lll*] FocusAndWarp
 
and it works great !

----------------------

i am still in a fog concerning how modifiers work in xmodmap though.

for example (this is a default setting):
    keycode  64 = Alt_L Meta_L
    
    I assume this means that if i shift my Alt_L key, then i get Meta_L

    But... don't i already get Meta, without shifting ? 

    (because, to use this fvwm mapping, i type Alt-a, NOT Shift-Alt-a)

         Key a       A   M   Next [CurrentScreen *aux*] FocusAndWarp

so, shat gives ?   looking thru the linux documentation for the 
loadkeys command (for the console), i found a description 
of how modifiers work
	but i am not sure they work the same way in X.

------_=_NextPart_000_01BE6F85.9CC1967E
Content-Type: text/plain

Hi,

I download FVWM 2.2 and built it in my workstation. ( I enclosed my
config.log file. ) But when I relog in via OpenWin, the screen turn dark
with nothing on it. Only first button ( left button ) of the mouse could pop
down a list include "builtin menu" and "exit fvwm". Does anybody know what's
wrong on it?

( I doubt the installation is not complete because at first time there're a
lot of error when building, such as "miss <X11/xpm.h>", "can't find
rplay.h", "can't find readline.h", etc. I have no way but copy the missing
files from somewhere. )

Thanks,
Chen

  Having played abit more, I'll clarify a little. The popups created by
this app. come up at the front, as you'd expect. But one can't move them
(under fvwm), they're not listed in the WindowList, and, most annoyingly,
*no* window will come to the front over them - if one raises a window, it
still ends up underneath the popup :-(

  The /only/ thing I can think of is that I've got some bizarre fvwm
'honour unsociable windows' flag set, but I still can't figure out what
(see previous mail for settings/X flags).

I just commited a patch to FvwmEvent that enables it to pass window-id's
to functions. Can you get the CVS version and see if it is useful.  I've
got a funny feeling that it's not quite enough.

Cheers,
Tim.

  Nah, our firewall won't let CVS go through it. Sounds good, though!

I'm having trouble figuring out how to use the Current/None/Next commands 
to implement a smart refocus to a window on the current page.  

Here's the problem.  I have Iconify and Scroll bound to keys.  When I 
iconify a window, I want the next reasonable window on the current page 
to get focus.  Likewise, when I scroll to a different page, if the cursor 
is not over a window on that new page, I want the next reasonable window 
on the current page to get focus.  I'm having trouble getting both these 
to work at once.  One persistent problem is that I don't want the focus to 
change when it is already good, for example if I attempt to scroll off the 
edge of my desktop, I don't want focus to change.

I started out with a Refocus command that I slap on the front of any call 
to Iconfiy or Scroll:

    AddToFunc NextFocus
    +    "I" Next (!Iconic CurrentPage) WarpToWindow 10 10

    AddToFunc Refocus
    +    "I" $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
    +    "I" <call NextFocus under the right conditions>

NextFocus properly selects a non-iconic window on the current page.  I 
only want to call it at the proper times, which is when there isn't already
a window on the current page that has focus.

What I want to do is

    +    "I" Current (!CurrentPage) NextFocus

However, CurrentPage is not negatable.  If I try

    +    "I" None (Visible CurrentPage) NextFocus

I don't refocus if there are any visible windows on the current page.

I have also tried experiments with conditions that use the current window 
number ($w), but I haven't gotten them to work, either.

Can anyone suggest a solution to this problem?

Hey,
 I was wanting to set up the control mouse click options on an xterm.
Specifically I was wanting an option to allow me to save the data output
to a file by using a cntrl mouse click on an xterm. Does anyone have
ideas?
TIA

Huh?

This works in FvwmConsole.

	AddToFunc Focus-and-Raise "I" Focus
 	+ "I" Raise

Well, this works too.

  FvwmCommand 'AddToMenu "Utilities" "xclock" exec xclock' ' + "test123" Exec exec Eterm '

Did somebody downgrade them recently?

It will work most of the time but there is no guarantee that something
else hasn't caused fvwm to execute an AddToMenu or something.  If that
happens the plus command will be diverted and won't get added to the
Focus-and-Raise function. If you start using FvwmEvent/FvwmCommand to do
magic things automatically like creating functions or menus on the fly
you might very well get bitten by this.

It's probably quite safe to use "+" in FvwmConsole etc. but only if you
do it fairly quickly, i.e. don't go for a coffee in between.

fvwm could remember the destination the last AddTo* command on every
input stream and use that for "+" commands from modules, but it's a lot
of work and no-one has reported being affected by it.

Cheers,
Tim.

oops, you are right it didn't work at somepoint and I forgot that it was
fixed, you are correct it works in console, talk, and command.  So the
key here is the need for the recapture

I think it's OK to just forward requests like these to
fvwm-bug. We don't really need all the extra information
for enhancement requests.

That was the 'Key ...' line probably. Key bindings are not
activated before you do a 'Recapture'.

Do you have by any chance the 'root-tail' program running anywhere?

I know it's been quite a while, but finally I found the time to check
the code. The reason is simple. There is no such option in FvwmTaskBar.
This must be a fvwm95 specific option.

I know if I have a key bound to Next [<some window>] Focus it will give
the window I specify Focus and leave the cursor in whatever window I was
in.My question is is there a way to give focus back to the window with
the cursor in it?

Hi,

I recently started using fvwm 2.2, and I've noticed a problem with
FvwmTaskBar: in my .fvwm2rc file, I have (among other things)


AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec emacs 
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec xterm 
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec xterm 
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec netscape
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmTaskBar


The task bar starts up as it should, but it looks like this:

  Quit |  Xterm       |  Xterm       |

with no entries for Emacs or Netscape.  When I move the mouse over the
task bar, then it refreshes itself and shows all of the appropriate
buttons.  Any ideas why?

Sorry, I forgot to say, this is on a Sparcstation running Solaris 2.5.

  Since installing 2.2, I've noticed that all output from X apps. (e.g.,
reasons for death, etc.) have stopped going to /dev/console. I do get
other stuff coming out on my xterm -C, includingh echo hello >
/dev/console, but nothing from apps. launched from fvwm.

  It's also worth noting that I'm now running from the 'CDE' login under
Solaris 2.5.1, whereas previously I was running from a command-line login
under 2.4.

  Next time I log out, I'll try the command-line login again, just in
case, but in the meantime, does anyone have any ideas?

Yes. In several places initiating a refresh is simply forgotten in
the code. I have fixed it on my disk at home already. The fixes
will make it into the development tree in a few days.

  That's what it is. Does anyone know how to get my fvwm/X output 'back'?

On my Sun Ultra 1 with Solaris 2.6, CDE redirects the output to a file
in ~/.dt/sessionlogs.  The file name depends on machine and display
name, but it should be easy to find :-)

Hi,

Thanks for your response. Now I want to simplify my question:

1. I download FVWM 2.2 from http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/download.html. The file
name is fvwm-2.2.tar.gz.

2. Untar this file will create "fvwm-2.2" directory in "/usr/local/".

3. Execute "configure --prefix=/usr/local/fvwm > cfg.result" under directory
"/usr/local/fvwm-2.2".

4. Run "make > make.result" under directory "/usr/local/fvwm-2.2".

5. Run "make install > install.result" under directory
"/usr/local/fvwm-2.2".

6. Now there're three directories created in /usr/local/fvwm/: "bin",
"libexec" and "man".

7. Create my .xinitrc and .fvwm2rc according
/usr/local/fvwm-2.2/modules/FvwmSaveDesk/example/xinitrc and fvwm2rc.

8. Relog in with OpenWin session and screen turn dark with nothing on it. I
can only press left button of the mouse and select "Exit FVWM".

My workstation is ultra5, OS is SunOS 5.5.1. I don't know if I describe it
more clearly this time. Do you find something wrong?

 <<cfg.result>>  <<make.result>>  <<install.result>>  <<.xinitrc>>  
<<.fvwm2rc>> 
Thanks,
Chen

Check your $HOME/.dtprofile file.  There is probably a line that looks
like this:

export dtstart_sessionlogfile="/dev/null"

Above this should be some comments explaining that application output
will be sent to the above file.  Changing "/dev/null" to "/dev/console"
should redirect the application output to your console (after you
restart).

You must be using SloppyFocus/MouseFocus.  If you have a menu bound to a
key that always works you can hit that, then Escape. The pointer should
be returned and the focus changed back. Alternatively try this:

Mouse 2 A	M	NOP

It uses up alt-btn2 to do nothing but it does change focus.

Tim.

This is fairly straight forward

AddToFunc my_iconify I Iconify on
+ I Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

This is tough. I don't know of a way of telling that there isn't a
currently focussed window.

Have you tried "Current (!Visible)"?

This might be very convoluted but $w is zero if there isn't a focussed
window so you might be able to do something like 

+ I PipeRead <script> $w

and have a script that prints out "NextFocus" if arg1 is 0

> Can anyone suggest a solution to this problem?

You're not the first person to ask for a !CurrentPage test.  If you get
stuck enter a bug report (with a patch please).

Cheers,
Tim.

I think this is a large part of your problem.

  > ModulePath /usr/local/fvwm

is definitely wrong.  You should either remove the ModulePath setting
altogether (highly recommended; fvwm knows where to look!) or, if you
want to find new, nonstandard modules you should use the $FVWM_MODULEDIR
environment variable to represent the default path.

With this setting no modules can be found.  Like, FvwmM4 for example.

Pls. see the NEWS file and the man page for more info on this.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

The FvwmIdent module is pretty good at giving me info
on the size and placement of windows, but it does not
give info about the icon size or placement. It would
be great if it could also give this info.

In addition it would be nice if there were a way to draw
a rubber band on the screen and get geometry info for the
box. This would aid in placing windows exactly where I
want them.

Please CC me on any replies since I'm not on any of the
fvwm mail aliases.

BTW - Great job to the fvwm team. I am impresses with the
ability to control the desktop. I can make it look exactly
the way I want.

I have some propositions but working only with ClickToFocus and
FvwmButtons as Sticky window.
Try this:

Style "FvwmButtons" CirculateSkip

AddToFunc RaiseFocus            "I" Raise
+                               "I" Focus

AddToFunc RaiseFlip             "I" Raise
+                               "I" FlipFocus

AddToFunc TopToEnd "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) Focus
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

AddToFunc NextFlip "I" Next (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) RaiseFlip

AddToFunc PrevFlip "I" Current (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic !FvwmButtons)\
TopToEnd
+                  "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) RaiseFlip

AddToFunc last_active "I" \
Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage CirculateHit FvwmButtons) FlipFocus
+ "I" Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

AddToFunc scroll_rt     "I"     Scroll  100     0
+                       "I"     Function        last_active


AddToFunc scroll_lt     "I"     Scroll  -100    0
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

AddToFunc scroll_dn     "I"     Scroll  0       100
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

AddToFunc scroll_up     "I"     Scroll  0       -100
+                       "I"     Function        last_active

Key Left        A       1       scroll_lt
Key Right       A       1       scroll_rt
Key Up          A       1       scroll_up
Key Down        A       1       scroll_dn

Key Escape      A       1       WindowList Root c c \
"Prev (CurrentDesk CurrentPage !iconic) RaiseFlip"

Maybe this is a bit complicated but works quite good.
Order of windows on pages is saved and while iconifying active window
previous on the list is activated.
Switching pages by Alt-Cursors activates last active on that page and
while switching by mouse Alt-Tab does the same.

But generally speaking it will be nice to have additional function
in fvwm which places window on the top of window list like Focus but does
it by not changing order of other windows :

[a] <- top

[b]

[c]

[d]  - this I want to be active and on top

[e]


then

[d]  <- top

[b]

[c]

[e]

[a] - previous active goes to end of the list

It is not hard to do that. Just extract desired window from the list and
glue it after top and then switch top to this position and activate it.

I have "Style * NoIcons" and problem is that in my opinion Iconify
shouldn't switch focus to previous window on the list automatically.
I just want focus to stay on the same position and define:

AddToFunc Iconify-and-Prev "I" Iconify 1
+ "I" PrevFlip

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I am using fvwm2.2 over XFree86 3.3.3.1 over FreeBSD 3.1, and very nice
it is too :)

I have been constructing my "look", starting from the supplied
fvwm-2.2/sample.fvwmrc/new-features file, which contains:
BorderStyle Active Solid #1ea819 -- NoInset HiddenHandles
BorderStyle Inactive Solid #11236b -- NoInset HiddenHandles

I believe that the elements "Solid #1ea819" and "Solid #11236b", perform
no useful function, as the actual border colour is taken from the second
parameter of HilightColor and the default BackColor style.

Is this a minor documentation oversight, or have I missed something?

Thanks
Richard.

You are right, it's a bug in the sample fvwm2rc.  Borderstyle only
understands TiledPixmap at the moment.

The only thing that has happend here that wouldn't happen with FlipFocus
is that [a] has been moved to the bottom. The order becomes dabce rather
than dbcea. Why do you want [a] to go to the bottom?

This sounds like you have ClickToFocus on. What happens with

AddToFunc Iconify-and-Prev "I" PrevFlip
+ I WindowId $w Iconify 1
?

I haven't tried this but I think it should do the focus changing stuff
before iconifying so the iconifying shouldn't invoke an automatic focus
change (that happens only when the current window is iconified).

Tim.

I want this to get behaviour similar to Prev and then Focus but without
reordering windows which are on other pages/desks. I need this 
to activate proper window (the last active one) after switching
pages/desks. Focus is bad in that situation because it changes order to
d e a b c which places e befor b and c.

OK, I'll try that.

Note that since 2.2 the correct syntax for iconify is

  Iconify on

The old syntax with numbers is obsolete and may be removed in
the future. I guess we should update all examples in the man page.

First,
I realy enjoy fvwm2.  This is my first unix set up, it rocks...
I use fvwm2 with solaris7 x86 pent 266, 200mg ram, api xpert@play98 video card.
though the driver is for xpert@play or the 3d rage pro (i need 3d rage pro tubo)

1) netscape problem
I am having some problems though.  Netscape comunicator 4.5 w/128 bit encryp 
seems to crash the window manager occasionaly, mostly it seems when there is 
graphicaly intense stuff, ie. www.gnome.org  .  When the crash occurs I just get 
logged out of my session and brought back to the login screen.  

I have tried to use netscape 4.08 (comunicator) and it crashed also.  I don't 
know if this is a problem with netscape or fvwm2.  I have not been able to 
reproduce the problem with CDE, but I don't use it much because I like fvwm2 
much better.

2) Sometimes when I log out out fvwm2 and try to login in console mode my screen 
gets filled with funky shapes and charachters which blink.  the space each one 
occupies is about 1.5cm x 0.5 cm.  I can log in to the console, execute 
commands, eventhough I can't  see what I am typing because my screen is messed 
up.  I can exit and I will get brought back into sun's GUI login screen and 
everything seems fine.  I can loginto my window manager of my choice and code 
away.

If you are back at the login screen, your XServer is crashing, not fvwm2.
The last "incident" I ran into with the Sun XServer crashing was related
to running out of colors.  Since you also mention Netscape...

If your video card is limited to displaying 256 colors at once,
run netscape with the "-install" option and add the command "ColorLimit 99"
to the beginning of your .fvwm2rc file.

Sounds like your display ends up in a non-text video mode.
Since I don't really have any experience with Solaris X86,  I'm guessing.

Actually, not necessarily. It depends on how the Window Manager was started. If 
its started in the background by XDM that yes, you're right. But, if instead
fvwm is started using "exec" or simply called upon then as soon as fvwm stops
the XDM session is closed. That's how my setup is working.

I have compiled and installed the fvwm2.2 on a Digital Alpha
successfully, but I experience weird thing while using the WM. 

One problem is that when I try to move a window the window will
(instantly) jump down about 200-300 pixels. The window can then only be
moved in the *x*-direction, and then exactly the same amount as I move the
mouse-pointer in the *y*-direction. The window wont move in
the*y*-direction at all, except for the initial 200-300 pixel jump. The
pointer's x-position is not used at all. Also, when I click any of the
mouse buttons, the first pop-up menu is always displayed. 

To me it seems that the mouse-pointers x-position is overwritten by the
y-position. Could this be because of a type casting error? I am rookie on
X11 programming, but I think I have tracked some of the problems. For
instance, the values of x_root & y_root in structure XMotionEvent seems to
be really messed up. I found this problem in fvwm/move.c in methods
moveLoop(), InteractiveMove() etc.

The platform I am running fvwm on is a Digital Alpha (I actually have
tried on several different Digital Alpha's) with Digital Unix & a
in-house compile FVWM version 2.2. On Sun Solaris fvwm works just fine.

I would be glad if someone could send me a precompiled alpha-version of
fvwm2 (or fvwm95).

Thanks alot

Hello all,

I am new to FVWM. I like to set it up with
ClickToFocus
working regardless of any modifier key. How should
I modify my .fvwm2rc to pass on ButtonPress Event
after
FVWM have been reacted from ClickToFocus?
Thank you in advance!

Samuel

Strange. Could you give us the offending lines with some context and
line numbers? What exactly is messed up there?

You're out of luck here. ClickToFucus does not work with
modifiers pressed.  If you absolutely need this you can
modify the source:

In file fvwm/events.c, function HandleButtonPress:

Replace

  /* click to focus stuff goes here */                                          
  if((Tmp_win)&&(Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&(Tmp_win != Scr.Ungrabbed) &&  
     (!MaskUsedModifiers(Event.xbutton.state)))                                 
  {                                                                             

With

  /* click to focus stuff goes here */                                          
  if((Tmp_win)&&(Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&(Tmp_win != Scr.Ungrabbed))                                 
  {                                                                             

(I didn't test this myself).

The following command solves your second problem:

  GlobalOpts ClickToFocusPassesClick

Thank you Dominik!! It work, but it only work when I
click on frame or side border or title. How can I make
it work on the application window? It seem to be that
application window can be set to focus by only one
single click and without modifier key.

I try make use of "mouse" command in the .fvwm2rc file
such as:

	mouse 0 W A Focus

This command will bring the focus to the window, but
I cannot do any action with any mouse click to the 
window any more. So, this command doese not help.
Do you know any work-around for it?

Actually, I am writting an application with multiple
windows. I like to change my focus on those window
when
I press any key combination with mouse click on it.
Then, I carry on any action from one window to other
without extra user input. Do you know which apart of
the source I should modified to make this work too.

Once again, thank you very much for your help!!

Samuel

Gnome compliance is being worked on; the layer stuff is mostly there and
the hints are to be in shortly.  If you want to play, consider checking out
the current sources from CVS or grabbing a nightly snapshot.

  Um. In the man page, it says "

                                 By default the direction is left
          to  right, then top to bottom.  This would be expressed
          as:

               IconFill left bottom


  Is that right? Does 'left' mean "LEFT to right" and 'bottom' mean "top
to BOTTOM"?

  I'm confused. I'll have to go and have several restarts now to find out
which direction is meant.

I'd guess this means the screen is filled in this order:

+--+--+--+--+
| 9| ...... |
+--+--+--+--+
| 5| 6| 7| 8|
+--+--+--+--+
| 1| 2| 3| 4|
+--+--+--+--+

So the manpage seems not to be consistent.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

  It *looks* like it's actually the other way around - IconFill specifies
the destination edge, not the source edge. But I can't really tell since
Netscape, the one I'm try to use with it, is having a bit of a fit. Using:

Style "Navigator"       IconBox 54x54+941+0, IconBox -54 -1 -1 0, \
                        StartsOnPage 1 0, IconFill left top

  ... I get my first nav. window up in the geom. bit (where I leave it
'docked'). The next goes bottom right, as I'd expect (if IconFill works
'backwards'). Then any other ones get dumped on top of each other around
(not necessarily in exactly the same spot, but overlapping) the /top-left/
of the specified box.

  I'll try this later with another, 'safer' app ...

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello all;

I have run into a bit of a snag:
Bellow are relavent parts of the ./config output:

checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm... yes
checking for X11/xpm.h... yes
checking for Xpm 3.4f or better... yes


Configuration:

  FVWM Version:             2.2

  Build extra modules?      yes
  Have ReadLine support?    yes
  Have RPlay support?       no
  Have XPM support?         yes


It makes fine without any problems, except for a missing history.h in one of the extra modules, which I am sure has nothing at all to do with xpm.

when I load up fvwm it gives me an error that xmp support not build in..

How can I fix this problem?

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated...

Thanks
Tamer


please email me back at nero@in-design.com 
as this is from a machine at home ....
Thanks alot in advance...

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone could help me with this compile error. I am
not that familiar with the code behind FVWM2 but am very familiar with
Unix C programming. I am making the assumption that this will compile
without requiring me to tweek with the code. I am currently running
RedHat 5.1 on a AMD/133.  I am also running FVWM 2.2 that I installed
from the RPM I found on
RedHat's RPM depository site.  Before I could get this going I had to
update many other packages.  I wanted to recompile the source to have
the Icon/shaped Icon feature.     Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks! -Chris

I'm currently using FVWM95 with RH Linux 5.2.  I keep a lot of shell windows
open but I'm unable to tell which one is which in the taskbar. It would be
nice if the working directory would show up in the window title and in the
taskbar when the window is reduced.  Maybe this is already possible.  I
would delve into this myself but I just have to many other projects to work
on at the moment that are not optional.

Another small but sometimes annoying occurrence is popup menus near the
right side of the screen.  If you right click close to the right side, roll
over an item that is itself a menu, the new menu pops up over the top of the
current menu, preventing selection of the next item.  The new menu should
popup to the left of the current menu.

Just a few suggestion to make things a little more usable.

This is the FVWM (FVWM-2, actually) mailing list; there's another list
for Fvwm95.

Here's a simple script that might work for you (title.sh)

    #! /bin/sh

    case "$TERM" in
    xterm*)	    [ -n "$1" ] && echo -n "^[]0;${1}";;
    esac

Note that the '^[' above should be a literal ESCAPE (Hex 1b) in your
script file and not the two characters I replaced it with above.

Note that your shell may require the use of "echo \c" instead:

    #! /bin/sh

    case "$TERM" in
    xterm*)	    [ -n "$1" ] && echo "^[]0;${1}\c";;
    esac


Anyway, typing "title.sh `pwd`" should then retitle your xterm to the
current working directory.  You can use aliases, shell functions, or
hooks to get your shell to run this whenever you change directories. 
Consult your shell documentation or man page for more information.

Are you using xterms (or any variant thereof)?

If you do, you can achieve this using simple escape sequences on your command
line.

For example, I have these funcs defined in my .profile:

# Sorry for the french: Translation: set window title
# Fonction pour mettre le titre de la fenetre a une valeur quelconque.
set_wmtitle() {
  if [ ".$1" = "." ]; then
    echo "Utilisation: set_wmtitle TITRE"
  else
    echo "]2;$1\c"
  fi
}

# Translation: Set Icon title
# Fonction pour changer le nom de l'icon
set_wmicon() {
  if [ ".$1" = "." ]; then
    echo "Utilisation: set_wmicon TITRE"
  else
    echo "]1;$1\c"
  fi
}

# Augment the 'cd' command: this one puts the PWD in the title bar
cdd() {
  if [ $SHELL = zsh ]; then
    OLDCWD=`pwd`;command cd;cd $1;CWD=`pwd`
  else
    OLDCWD=`pwd`;unalias cd;cd $1;CWD=`pwd`; alias cd=cdd
  fi

  #  PS1="../`basename $CWD`> "
  echo  "]2;LOGIN - [$HOST":"$LOGNAME] $CWD\c"
}

# If not using VIM...
# use this to put the buffer name in the window title area
# VI pour mettre le nom du fichier ainsi que le CWD dans le haut de la fenetre
_vi() {
  # CSH Syntaxe
  #   echo "]2; [$HOST":" $CWD] \!*"; ex -v \!*; mypwd'
  # KSH Syntax
   echo "]2; [$HOST":" $CWD] $*"; ex -v $*;cdd $CWD
}


Hope this helps a little..

As has already been pointed out, wrong list.

Fvwm2 has all the menu controls you could think of, including
the fix for the problem you identified.

(And it is just as capable of looking like Windows as fvwm95 is.)

This might help:

In fvwm/fvwm.h find these 2 lines:

extern void SigDone(int);
extern void Restart(int nonsense);

change them to:

RETSIGTYPE SigDone(int);
RETSIGTYPE Restart(int nonsense);

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I use:

GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick 
Style "*"	ClickToFocus

Which works as I would expect in most windows.  The way it works in
windows that never receive focus seems odd.

My FvwmPager never receives focus.  With ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick
set I click on the FvwmPager window once, and nothing happens (Focus
is still on the previous window).  When I click on the FvwmPager
window a second time, it does what it should.

It almost seems like  ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick has its own idea
of what window has focus.

Any ideas on fixing this.

Dan D Niles

P.S. If it makes any difference, I am using Fvwm 2.2.

   Version: Fvwm 2.2

   The Resize function acts a bit weird when I try make a window
   smaller. First I have to move the a little bit to make the window
   larger, then I can make it smaller.

   An inconvenience. Would it be possible to allow making the window
   smaller right away?

Is it possible to get FvwmAnimate to animate iconification if you have
NoIcon set?  Such as to FvwmTaskBar or FvwmIconBox or FvwmIconMan.  say
like if I swallow FvwmIconMan into a FvwmButtons so I have a pseudo
taskbar but the window frames animate?

Hi all,

I'm having the hardest time figuring out the following problem.  Any
help, hints, or ideas will be greatly appreciated.  I am not on the
Fvwm mailing list so please CC with any responses.  I will post a
followup if there is any interest.  Will answer Python, Mailman, or CC
Mode question for food (or help :-).

My system: Solaris 2.6 (w/ all recent patches), Open Windows 3.6 X
server (also w/ all recent patches).  I have been using Fvwm 2.0.46
since it came out, and love it.  I tried the following with Fvwm 2.2
but that did not seem to fix my problem.

I have just started using CodeWarrior Pro4 for Solaris.  This is a
commercial Java IDE.  I suspect that this was ported from a Mac using
some kind of porting tool.  The GUI looks quite Mac-like in places;
file name separators are `:' in some places too.

When I have a CodeWarrior window open, and I try to resize it using
the `Resize' builtin function, the outer Fvwm frame resizes just fine,
however the contents of the window don't repaint to fill the new
borders[*].  No matter what I try, no matter what style settings I
use, or options I set, I can never get the contents to fill the frame.
It's almost as if some window manager event is not getting propagated
to the app -- it doesn't know it's been resized and so it just sits
there.

Naturally, I complained to Metrowerks (CodeWarrior's vendor).  They
said Fvwm is not a supported window manager at this time -- they only
support CDE.  So, I tried to be a good little Solaris user, and
started up a vanilla stock CDE window system, fresh from dtlogin.
Besides CDE (and I assume dtwm) being completely horrible, I tried to
resize my CW windows, and sure enough, it worked!  I enlarge the
frame, the app repaints to fill the new real-estate.

I figured maybe my Fvwm is just too old, so I downloaded Fvwm 2.2.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't cause the resize.

What magic is CDE/dtwm doing that Fvwm is missing???  Is there some
option, variable, style (or even #define in the code :-) I can twiddle
to get this to work.  Please don't make me use CDE!

Thanks,
-Barry

Is it possible to get SloppyFocus/ClickToFocus in fvwm2.3.0?  Or to be
more exact SloppyFocus but still have the ClickToFocus ability to click
anywhere in the window rather then just the titlebar/border to raise?

Yes it would be possible, but source code changes would be required.

The problem is that only the "NoIcon" modules (FvwmIconMan, etc.)
know where the other end of the animation is.  Until those
modules are changed, FvwmAnimate only has 1/2 the information it
would need.

Until we come up with a motivated developer that likes animation
and wants to use one of the "NoIcon" modules, and has the time,
this project is pending.

This has been mentioned before, but just so we don't loose track
of this issue, I've added this request to the fvwm2 bug tracking
database.

I just updated.. It was a slow starter, but then it ran along just fine.

	That's the intent of the 

GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises

option. It does produce the intended effect; unfortunately, it breaks a
couple of other things, so I can't recommend its use right now. Maybe
one of us will have a chance to figure out how to fix it before the next
release.

	I'll try to find my old notes on the problem (from 2.0.46 days) this
weekend and see if I can refresh my memory of what it breaks and why (as
well as I recall, it's pretty convoluted!) I believe it caused a problem
with moving undecorated transients, and also a failure of some apps to
receive double clicks.

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>fvwm</b> [ <i>options</i> ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<i>Fvwm</i> is a window manager for X11. It is a derivative of <i>twm</i>, 
redesigned 
to minimize memory consumption, provide a 3-D look to window frames, and
provide a simple virtual desktop.  Memory consumption is estimated at about 
one-half to one-third the memory consumption of <i>twm</i>, due primarily to a 
redesign of <i>twm</i>'s method to storing mouse bindings. In 
addition, many of the configurable options of Twm have been removed. 
<p>
The name "FVWM" used to stand for something, but I forgot what. (Feeble,
famous, foobar? It doesn't really matter, this is an acronym based society 
anyway.)

I'm using it for months now and it breaks nothing. What do you have in mind?
I can indeed recommend that. The only thing you might or might not like is
that the click is always passed to the application. That hardly ever matters
however.

Moving undecorated transients has been 'fixed'. This was not even a bug
since undecorated transients don't have a border (they only look as if),
so you can't move them with the mouse over the border. I've never noticed
any application having trouble with double clicks.

I have to apologize for my previous post, I didn't mean to send html
over the wire, I must have choose the wrong option when quoting the
link.  For all those people that couldn't make out the link in the
pervious message it's
http://www.num.math.uni-goettingen.de/nam/docs/fvwm.html.  Again it is
outdated however it does supply info on how to do some of fvwm more
confusing functions like mouse bindings and the like.

	Well, I considered it a bug. The behavior was inconsistent with the
handling of naked transients in all other circumstances, where you could
drag with the mouse in the context of the tiny exposed bit of the frame.
I'm glad it's been fixed.


> I've never noticed any application having trouble with double clicks.

	I had the problem with moxfm. Still do. This seems to be an
app-specific problem, however, so I'll have to withdraw my
non-recommendation - except for someone who uses moxfm.

My question is more of asking the best way to go about it not if it's
possible because I know it is.

Well I'd like to implement some sorta simple theme setup for my
.fvwm2rc. maybe about 2 or 3 at most so it shouldn't be too hard,
however I want it to do more then the standard style changes.  What I
would like is for fvwm2 when started up to maybe read a file or
something that says what the last theme I was on was and use that one,
then I want it to modify maybe my .Xdefaults file or something I point
it to so that Netscape and all other apps follow that same colours
scheme which looks pretty nice I must say.  Does anyone know what method
editres uses to make changes in an app without restarting it?

So basically my question is what is the best way of going about this?
Like a bash script I imagine with a bunch of grep and awk commands would
be easiest, or does fvwm2 have this capability?  Lastly a way to do the
theme setup without using read commands on files that have all the style
decorations and the like since fvwm2 takes for ever to startup and it
uses too much memory.

Oh and I guess one more, is there any places that have good tutorials on
FvwmScript or FvwmForm?

Hi. Just converted over to 2.2 after using fvwm95 for a few years. I'm
impressed by some of the neat options, etc.

One thing I've not been able to figure out is this. Using the fvwm95
task bar I set

	*FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly
	
However, this doesn't appear to work with the fvwm2 taskbar. I copied
the old fvwm95 taskbar module to my fvwm2 directory and this seems to be
okay. But I don't like to use modules from one wm for another...

Is there something I'm missing in the docs for the taskbar to get this
to work?

Yes, you're reading the wrong docs ;-) The fvwm2 taskbar simply doesn't
have this option. The fvwm95 taskbar has some features the fvwm2 version
doesn't have. Probabply because the taskbar is much more important in a
Windoze clone. If anybody volunteers to merge the two taskbars I'll
happily put the new version into the fvwm sources.

There are some tough applications when you try to change their settings.
xosview for example refused to accept anything I told it. I start it
this way now:

Exec echo 'xosview*background:' CBACK | xrdb -merge; exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xosview +load +mem -net -cpu -int -swap +page -geometry 100x50+0-0 -font FONTXXXS`

Sorry for the long line, but that's the way I do it. This way I can
modify its colours and font without restarting fvwm. Of course I have
to restart xosview.

I do quite a lot of this stuff. If you want I can send you my
config files, but I must warn you, they are quite complicated.

Hope that helps

No. But that's why I have all releases since 2.0.45 on my disk :)

In events.c(HandleButtonPress) I had to change this code:

    if (...)
    {
      RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);
      KeepOnTop();
    }
    XSync(dpy,0);
    XAllowEvents(dpy,ReplayPointer,CurrentTime);
    XSync(dpy,0);
    return;

to the new version:

    if (...)
    {
      RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);
      XSync(dpy,0);
      XAllowEvents(dpy,ReplayPointer,CurrentTime);
      XSync(dpy,0);
      return;
    }

The old code simply gobbled up the button press before the
binding could be processed. The original bug report mentioned
the corners of a transient. Since undecorated transients don't
have corners you can't bind anything to them. Only the side bars
('s') will work.

Well, after looking again I must confess it was a real bug.

Nope. Reading the right docs...and it isn't there. Just in my fvwm95rc
file.

Oh? I'm not sure. I use the task bar all the time (and have icons turned
off). I like the clean background screen with xearth running. What I
like is to have three or four pages all running separate xterms. Then,
for development I just click the task bar to switch between editors,
etc. Ummm, if you don't use a task bar, how do you do this? Surely
bringing up the window list is much slower. And keeping all the windows
on one page is just messy. I'm certainly not a windows guy, so that's
not the reason I'm doing it this way....

I will have a look at the differences between the two sources and see if
I can make sense of anything....no promises. If someone else wants to do
this, no problems.

I've been running the 95 taskbar for a few days and it appears to be
find.

It works for me. Could you provide some more information (config file)?

First of all you assume that everybody makes extensive uas of the mouse.
I do 90% of the work with the keyboard. The one exception is changing
the focus and raising windows. I switch pages with Alt-Fn like Linux's
virtual consoles. On all but the first pages I have nearly screen filling
applications, so the mouse is almost always in the right window. If not
I have to move the mouse a bit (using SloppyFocus helps a lot) and definitely
less that if I'd move to the taskbar first. On the first page I run several
shells, an X console window and xemacs. Nothing I can't handle with a bit
of move-and-click. And if the window is obsured there's still my
FvwmIconMan in my FvwmButtons. Much smaller that a taskbar.

Anyway, I'm currently working on an easy solution to create sigle-key
shortcuts to all kinds of objects handled by a window manager (windows,
menus, functions). This should reduce mouse usage by another 80% or so.

Great! Most of the time the biggest problem of such things getting done
is not *who* will do it but *when*.

There have been some changes to fvwm's module interface for some
advanced feature of the fvwm95 taskbar. In the best case they simply
won't work with fvwm2.

Would you object to giving the list a sneak preview of the general ideas
involved? (You have made at least me curious. :-)) Invoking menus and
functions with key strokes is described in the man page, and windows are
also fairly staightforward:

AddToFunc Warp		I Next ($0) Iconify -1
+			I Next ($0) Raise
+			I Next ($0) Focus

Key d	A  4	Warp	XDvi
Key g	A  4	Warp	ghostview

The basic idea is to make it dynamic. For example you assign keys
F9 - F12 to be 'shortcut keys'. At first they are unbound (or
perhaps preloaded with a default). When you press shift-Fn the
currently focussed window is bound to Fn. Whenever you press
Fn now the viewport is switched to the page/desk with the window,
the window is raised, deiconified, unshaded and focused and the
pointer is moved into it. Something similar can be done with
menus, menu items and functions.

This is just a description of the basic ideas. Much of this can
be configured.

I am using the IconMan module as a task bar, it only shows the windows 
that are on the current page.  Here is my configuration (I am (still) 
using version 2.0.46, but I doubt it has changed).

*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers		1
*FvwmIconMan*background		#c0c0c0
*FvwmIconMan*foreground		black
*FvwmIconMan*format			"%i (%c)"
*FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry		1280x0
*FvwmIconMan*managergeometry	1x1+0-0
*FvwmIconMan*drawicons		false
*FvwmIconMan*resolution		page
*FvwmIconMan*followfocus	true
*FvwmIconMan*focusbutton	down black #c0c0c0
*FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton	down black #e0e0e0
*FvwmIconMan*selectbutton	up black #e0e0e0
*FvwmIconMan*dontshow		class=FvwmButtons resource=FvwmPager

*FvwmIconMan*action     	Mouse   1 N sendcommand Focus, \
	    sendcommand "Iconify -1"
*FvwmIconMan*action     	Mouse   2 N sendcommand "Iconify 1"
*FvwmIconMan*action     	Mouse   3 N sendcommand "Iconify"



Maybe this is (closer to) what you want....

Bob,

I spent some time looking into the TaskBar module, and I've done some
work to replicate the functionality using FvwmButtons and
FvwmIconMan. See my web page (http://osiris.kosmic.org/~jim/) for a
screen shot and config file samples.

The only thing keeping my "taskbar" from being generic is that I need
to specify geometry to get it working on my screen, so as it stands
it's set up to be 1152 pixels wide. I imagine that could be overcome
with some M4 or cpp macros; I never run at any other resolution, so
I've never tackled it.

- Jim

	I am suporting a site which is using Fvwm95, and I am trying to
migrate them to Fvwm-2.2 and the Taskbar under that. Under the Fvwm95
taskbar the third mouse click, on one of the task bar entries, would bring
up a menu which would allow the use to Iconify, Minimize, Kill, etc the
window. I tried using the same menu under fvwm-2.2 and Fvwm-2.2 crashes
with a seg fault whenever I select one of the menu items.

	the menu is defined as

DestroyMenu "Window-Ops2"
AddToMenu "Window-Ops2" "&Restore"        Iconify -1
+                       "&Move"           Move-or-Raise
+                       "&Size"           Resize-or-Raise
+                       "Mi&nimize"       Iconify 1
+                       "Ma&ximize"       Maximize 100 100
+                       ""                Nop

+                       "&Close Alt+F4"   Delete 

	and under the FvwmTaskbar section I defined click 3 as

*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Popup Window-Ops2


	Am I doing anything obviously wrong, or incorrect?

You can do this using xterm escape sequences. See

Yeah, I noticed the same, but since it was a signal 11 segfault, I
wasn't sure if it was a problem specific to me or not... guess not.
Well, in all likelihood when taskbar tells fvwm what window to send
its actions to, it's okay with a builtin like Iconify, but something
naughty happens if it's a menu, that subsequently needs to know where
to send its actions to... Almost certainly a bug in 2.2's taskbar.

Hi,

I'm a newbie to Linux and X Windows programming.  I have purchased Red Hat
Linux 5.2 which includes fvwm2 2.0.46 and gtk+ 1.0.6.  I am also using a
tool called Glade which is a gtk+ user interface builder.

Now to my problem.  Sometimes when I compile and link and then run the
application I do not get the standard window dressing such as the frame,
title bar, and minimize, maximize, close button etc.  Applications that come
with Red Hat Linux do have all the dressings.  Applications such as xterm,
xfm, etc.  I have not modified any of the fvwm2 resource file.  They are as
delivered.  I do not have any user resource file.

Any ideas, suggestions??

TIA

Ed

A few things aren't going right for me.

1. If I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file it doesn't work:

Style Netscape* TitleIcon mini-nscape.xpm, StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping

However:

Style Netscape* StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping, TitleIcon mini-nscape.xpm

is fine. Does a TitleIcon command need to be at the end of a line?

2. I have 

	Style "*"       RandomPlacement

However, when my netscape windows come up they want to 'tile'. Each new
window is a bit lower (vertically) than the next. I assume that this is
to show the different titlebars. I have the geom set to +0+0 for the
netscape windows and really do want it that way. Can I force this?

I've never heard of the "TitleIcon" command.  What version of fvwm are
you using?  That could well be your problem.  Have you looked at the
error log fvwm2 prints to see if there's a syntax error shown here?

Perhaps you mean "MiniIcon"?  Check the fvwm2 man page.

If I understand you correctly, you should be able to create a specific
style for netscape windows and specify a different placement scheme for
them:

  Style "Netscape" <something else>

and that will override the "*" style.

Are you looking for:

 Style Netscape* Title, Icon mini-nscape.xpm, StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping
                      ^^

Opps, I knew there more questions :).

In my fvwm95rc I had the following:

	Key F25 A N Popup "StartMenu" +4 -24  # left window key
	Key F26 A N Popup "Window" -16 +16    # right window key
	Key F27 A N Popup "Utilities" +4 -24  # start key 

I changed this so that Popup is Menu, and verified the menu names. But
it seems that fvwm2 doesn't know about F25-27?

-------

Is there a way to bind something to the print-screen, Pause and
Scoll-lock keys on a PC keyboard?

---------

How would I bind a key to focus the FvwmButtons? Sometimes this gets
hidden under windows and it'd be nice to hit something to pop it to the
top.

Enuf for now---thanks!

How do I enable the printing of a error log?

Opps! I copies some stuff from the fvwm95 file.

Yes. I understand this. But, I guess what I'm asking is what placement
scheme forces the placement specified in the *geometry X resource? It
seems that fvwm2 is trying to be nice to me...and I don't want it to.

I'm using the 2.2 release.

Thanks.

I searched through the archives and found my question but no answer was
given.  I'm using Debian Slink, Fvwm2 2.0.46 and xdm.  When Fvwm2 loads
I have an iconified xconsole on my screen.  When I deiconify xconsole it
opens off my visible screen.  I would like to set it up so that xconsole
is deiconified and centered on my screen at start up.  There is nothing
about xconsole in my .fvwm2rc file.  When I did start xconsole from this
file it was present on screen but blank, no data written in it.  When I
use startx instead of xdm to start the x-session there is no xconsole
present.  Does anyone know where xconsole is starting from so I can edit
the file and how I can get it to load as I would like?  Please cc my
with replies.
Thanks,
Kent

Hi,

I'm a newbie to Linux and X Windows programming.  I have purchased Red Hat
Linux 5.2 which includes fvwm2 2.0.46 and gtk+ 1.0.6.  I am also using a
tool called Glade which is a gtk+ user interface builder.

Now to my problem.  Sometimes when I compile and link and then run the
application I do not get the standard window dressing such as the frame,
title bar, and minimize, maximize, close button etc.  Applications that come
with Red Hat Linux do have all the dressings.  Applications such as xterm,
xfm, etc.  I have not modified any of the fvwm2 resource file.  They are as
delivered.  I do not have any user resource file.

Any ideas, suggestions??

TIA

Ed

Could you fetch us a stack trace?

  # gdb fvwm2 core

If it's not fvwm that coredumped replace the approriate file name
(gdb tells you which).

You may have to modify your Xmodmap. I can't give you a detailed
description, but use the xmodmap command to modify it. Make sure
the keys are bound to something (xkeycaps can help too). To bind
The scroll lock key may be mapped as a modifier. You can't bind
to modifiers, so you'll have to remove the corresponding entry
in the Xmodmap to make that work.

This got produced by binding a menu to Mouse 3 on a taskbar button
like so:

*FvwmTaskBarAction      Click3  PopUp Window

where the menu "Window" is as follows:

AddToMenu       Window          "&Restore"      Maximize
+                               "&Move"         Move
+                               "&Size"         Resize
+                               "Mi&nimize%mini.winXX-minimize.xpm%" \
                                                Iconify
+                               "Ma&ximize%mini.winXX-maximize.xpm%" \
                                                Maximize
+                               ""              Nop
+                               "&Close Alt-F4%mini.winXX-close.xpm%" \
                                                Close

I think I chose "Minimize" though I'm pretty sure I can segfault with
*any* fvwm builtin that requires a target window.

The complete rcfile is available at
http://www.best.com/~mikehan/windoze.fvwm2rc
It's a Win98 emulation rcfile I've been working on.

Finally, this is a RH4.1 box running kernel 2.0.34 with the original
libc5.3.12 library. X libs are R6.1 and the server is AcceleratedX
2.1.

Make up your mind, fvwm2, or fvwm95?

On my type 4 Sun keyboard under Solaris 2.6, the keys F25,6,and 7
are keypad divide, keypad multiply, and there is no F27.

Anyway, fvwm2 will use them if they exist.  Use xkeycaps to verify
that they exist and to check which keys they are on.

Should be no problem.  Find out which keysym they generate, bind
the key.  If they don't currently generate a keysym, find the keycode
and use xmodmap to assign a keysym.

Write a function like this:

AddToFunc Warp "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
+	       "I" Next [$0] WarpToWindow 24p 24p
+              "I" None [$0] Beep

then bind a key like this:

Key Return R N Warp FvwmButtons

Dunno about Debian, but on my RedHat box the xdm files are in
/etc/X11/xdm. Also /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm is a symlink to this.
You probably want to edit Xsetup_0, which is a script that basically
starts xconsole with a specific geometry.

To fvwm list:

I have recently installed Red Hat Linux.  My previous experience is with
Ultrix and Digital Unix.

With those products there was a way to allow other hosts to use the local
display.

  i.e.  # rlogin central
        # xv

The xv window would appear on my local display if I gave permission to
central. If I didn't I got the standard message:

  Xlib: connection to "local" refused by server
  Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server
  xv: Can't open display

which is the message I am currently getting using Linux and fvwm.

I know this operation should be pretty basic but I can find no documentation
on how to grant display permission using fvwm.  I would really appreciate if
someone could point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance.

Richard

That's because you're looking in the wrong place.

Permissions to use your display are granted by your X server, not your
window manager.  It's completely out of fvwm's control who has
permission to create windows on the display.  So you won't find any
discussion of it in the fvwm docs :)

You want to look at the man page for the "xhost" command.  For example,

  $ xhost +remotehost

will allow any user logged into remotehost to create windows on your
display.  There are a number of security issues with this, so you should
check the manual.

Start an xterm with the '-C' option. This will display all messages
that go to the console (which is where fvwm printf its errors).

I have fvwm2 running on my home-linx and now I've started to use it at the
university too. They are running Solaris-unix with CDE-desktop
environment. With only suprisingly few problems I got fvwm2 running on top
of CDE, but tuning is hell. Problem: How do I tell the desktop to use it's
functions from a menu? When I quit fvwm2 CDE remains and I have no idea
how to launch the quit CDE session function.

Another (minor) thing. How can I launch an application on some random
page, go back to do what I was doing and the application would appear on
the page it was iniated. And I don't mean startsonpage -thing, because I'd
like it to work on any undetermined application and page.

Hopefully someone can help.

TIA

I'd recommend looking at ssh and ssh-agent. If you are slightly less

it's part of the default install...)

  I don't know about running fvwm2 /on top of/ CDE - I'm suprised
*anything* works! I personally select 'OpenWindows' login  from the CDE
login menu, and have my .xinitrc start up fvwm2 instead of olwm.

  Um. There may be an easy way to do this, but off the top of my head you
may have to do something tricky in a (csh/sh) script (using PipeRead)
like:

#!/bin/csh
# StartApp <pagex> <pagey> <app>

FvwmCommand 'Style "'$3'" StartsOnPage '"$1 $2"
toolwait $argv[3-]
FvwmCommand 'Style "'$3'"'

  'Cept that won't work as-is 'cos it'll clear (?) that app.'s Style
settings ...

I run fvwm from the CDE dtlogin - a hacked up 
version of xdm - with no problems.  In fact, its 
the only part of CDE that I never have problems
with!.

You need to have a directory /etc/dt which will 
contain overrides from the /usr/dt tree.  Among
these overrides are:

/etc/dt/config/C
/etc/dt/config/Xservers
/etc/dt/config/Xsession.fv2

/etc/dt/config/C/Xresources.d/Xresources.fv

This last looks like:
====================================
Dtlogin*altDtsIncrement:        True
Dtlogin*altDtName:      FVWM2 Desktop
!Dtlogin*altDtKey:       /usr/local/X11/bin/fvwm2
Dtlogin*altDtKey:       /usr/dt/bin/fvwm2
Dtlogin*altDtStart:     /etc/dt/config/Xsession.fv2
Dtlogin*altDtLogo:      FVlogo
====================================

with paths correct for your system and the 
Xsession.fv2 for your fvwm startup

Mine looks like

====================================
#!/bin/ksh
exec > /tmp/fvwm2.errors 2>&1
unset SDT_ALT_SESSION
unset SDT_ALT_HELLO
unset SDT_NO_DSDMexport
XFILESEARCHPATH=/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:/usr/local/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:/usr/local/X

then

else
     export

then
     cp /s2.5/local/etc/dt/config/C/template.fvwm2rc $HOME/.fvwm2rc
fi

done

Hope this helps

This is probably only of interest for those who want more
out of their .fvwm2rc configs, but either haven't the time,
luck, or resources, to find anything better.
It's the result of 'hacking up' a 3000 line .rc file into
several dozen files and directories.... then adding to it.
It needs no special installing of any libraries.
It merely is a collection of simple fvwm2 commands as
documented in the man pages.
It allows menu selction of decors, including the default
to load at Init/Restart, and menu control of FvwmEvent
configs, including individual events.
It also allows mutiple modules with individual configs.
All files are in relevant directories. Easily modifiable.
Separate configs for modules, decors etc....

Just posted awols-fvwm2config0.2g.tar.gz
and awols-fvwm2config0.2g.tar.bz2 (download either/or)
Icons included in pack. Screenshots are available.
Site is http://dove.net.au/~awol/fvwm2

I will hopefully find a way to put a save decor feature
into version 0.3
Still working on lots of other features....
Let me know if you have any problems with it.
In fact, just let me know if you are using it!

Hmm, works for me. Can you provide me all your Style
and GlobalOpt lines? Perhaps I can see it then, but
from looking at the code I can't imagine how this can happen.

Like I said, it should work. What version of fvwm are you
using?

Can you elaborate on your setup? What is the style of your pager?
You can't have windows that 'never receive focus' a 'neverfocus'
option has been in discussin but postponed until after the great
style flag rewrite. This explains everything for me. You told
the pager to be ClickToFocus. You focus it by clicking on it.
The click is swallowed because of the global option. The next
click goes to the pager. Why do you say the pager does not get
the focus?
