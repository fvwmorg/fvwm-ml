Hello,

I have EdgeResistance set to 10000 10000 (no moving off/scrolling).
But some of the new applications like xmms, xine, RealOne, etc.
don't seem to honour the EdgeResistance settings.

I can click on the title bar and move these windows, even though 
this is not in my fvwm bindings, and I can move them off the current 
page as well. 

I also have (Meta + Mouse2) bound to move. When I use this to move 
these windows, they stop at the page boundary as they should.

Is this because of some builtin bindings that these applications
define, which override my fvwm bindings? Just curious.

Thanks,
Mandar.

ps: I'm using fvwm-2.4.15-1 on RH 7.3.

When you use the fvwm title bar or the application builtin
title bar?

Yes, it is (If I well understand: the moving operation is done with
the app bultin title bar).

For some reason, I don't get a fvwm title bar. The application
has only its own title bar. 

Thanks for the clarification,

Hi,

I want to have an on-screen display (e.g. for showing the current desktop 
number after switching desktops). When activated it should display a some 
text (with a transparent background) and disappear after say 0.5 sec. 

How could something like this be implemented? 

If there is a program that can display text with a transparent background 
then I think it's easy:
1. killall any running instances of that program.
2. Call the program with the text message.
3. killall any running instances with FVWM's Schedule command.
Does such a program exist? Any ideas how to refine the above setup (I'd like 
to remove that dangerous killall command)?

Felix

I wish to position a button bar, created using FvmwButtons,
horizontally centered along the bottom edge of the screen.

Currently, I use m4 preprocessing to calculate the dimensions of the
button bar by summing individual button sizes and paddings.  Based on
that, I calculate the (x,y) coordinates needed to position the bar.
This is too complex and error-prone.  For instance, button sizes can
be affected by the length of a button's title and its font.

Is it possible that there is a straightforward method for doing such
a placement?

Actually, for my purposes it would suffice if there is a hook
which gives the total width of the button bar after it is created
and before it is mapped to the screen.

I am using version 2.4.5, if that matters.

There is no currently a Center (you want CenterBottom) placement.
You may use the following technique if you find it suitable.

Start FvwmButtons using a function that Wait's for it and then moves
it, like described in FAQ #3.18. To center it, use FAQ #7.14.

Mikhael.

There is no currently such variable, but it may be added.

Modules can receive the window layers.

Since there are only 12 (usually 3) layers, you may find a layer by a
simple query (several queries) like this:

  ThisWindow (Layer 4) Echo it is on the layer 4

I'm interested in getting the tool Tips in FvwmTaskBar to pop up immediately
when the mose is moved over a button.

I'm not having any luck finding where this timeout is set.

I notice that if I have a Tip showing and I quickly move the mose to another
button, the tip comes up instantly, but if I just move the mouse cursor over
the button there is ~1 second of delay.

Can someone point me in the right direction here?

-Tony

Well, if the man page does not mention a timeout for tips, there is no
such option.

Yes, kind of inconsistency. A feature or a bug, whatever name you prefer.

Not me, I guess.

Thanks, but this one has some problems. When I initiate several on-screen 
displays in a row (e.g. by quickly switching desktops) they overlap. TO 
avoid this I plan to use "killall osd_cat". However, osd_cat doesn't 
disappear immediatly after killing it, and therefore I'll still have 
overlapping osds. Do you have a solution for that? How do you use xosd?

Thanks, Mikhael, for your quick response to my query.  Your pointers
to the FAQ worked perfectly.  I implemented the positioning using
ReadPipe and FvwmEvent.

There is no currently a Center (you want CenterBottom) placement.
You may use the following technique if you find it suitable.

Start FvwmButtons using a function that Wait's for it and then moves
it, like described in FAQ #3.18. To center it, use FAQ #7.14.

Mikhael.

Can anyone help me?

After I add buttonstyle etc in my .fvwm2rc, every software has a title bar. But some software has their title bar already, like realone and xmms. So I add NoTile parameter for both of them.

It is strange. It works for xmms, but still does not work for realone.

Any advice?

Also, I use Icon parameter to define a .xpm icon for realone. It does not work. I use the same icon for aterm, it works.

It seems something is wrong with realone. Anyone knows how to fix it?

Many thanks.

Jack

A style command must match an application using either name, class or resource.
Perhaps you are not using the right name to match on.
Use FvwmIdent to find out what realone's name/class/resource are.

No, there seem to be 20 layers. For example I can move a window to layer 20 
and a test similar to the one below verifies that it is indeed on layer 20. 
But I can't move it higher. Is that correct?

In addition, I have another question: 
With the following procedure I can move a window to layer 0.
    1. Open a window (e.g. an rxvt).
    2. Restart FVWM using the "Restart" function.
    3. Move the window to the default layer with "Layer default".
Is this a bug (I'm still using 2.5.6)?


>   ThisWindow (Layer 4) Echo it is on the layer 4

I wrote an initialization function that creates a function which sets the 
layer name of the current window as the title of a menu (this is useful for 
a window menu which allows changing of layers):

    AddToFunc Create-Move-To-Layer-Menu-Set-Title
    + I SendToModule FvwmPerl eval \
        for ($i=$f::minlayer; $i <= $f::maxlayer; $i++) { \
        command("AddToFunc Move-To-Layer-Menu-Set-Title I ThisWindow (Layer 
$i) AddToMenu Window-Operations-Move-To-Layer $i Title Top"); \
        }

I set the varaibles $f::minlayer and $f::maxlayer somewhere else to 1 and 
20, respectively.

Hi,

I added the following menu entry

    + "QQQ: forward inka ports" Exec ssh -N -L1119:news.inka.de:119 
-L1125:mail.inka.de:25 -L1110:mail.inka.de:110 inka

However, when clicking on "QQQ: forward inka ports" the ssh deamon starts 
but terminates immediately afterwards. When I start the above ssh command 
from a terminal everything works fine. I already tried using the "-n" 
option but this doesn't work for port forwarding (then ssh terminates 
immediately, even when started from a terminal).

What am I doing wrong?

Felix

Do you want to start a ssh deamon or a client? 

Supposing you meant a ssh client I guess you should start a
xterm for the ssh. The following worked on my computer:

     + "QQQ: forward inka ports" Exec xterm -e ssh -N \
        -L1119:news.inka.de:119 -L1125:mail.inka.de:25 \
        -L1110:mail.inka.de:110 inka.de

The command above clearly indicates that I want to start a client. I doubt 
that I can forward ports from "inka" to my local computer using a deamon.

Sure, this will work. However, I don't want to start an xterm but redirect 
the output to a log file instead. Note that I use the ssh connection just 
for port forwarding, not for any interaction.

Well, -n is what you need, and when using -N ssh doesn't terminate for
me so long as the remote host is running ssh protocol version 2 (which
is required for -N to work.)  If the remote host is only running
protocol 1 and you don't have the power to upgrade the daemon on the
remote host (which would be the ideal solution), you'll have to give ssh
a command to run--either sleep with a long timeout, or a small program
that simply sits around and does nothing until terminated.

Well, the remote server is running "sshd version 1.2.32 [i686-unknown-lin=
ux]"=20
and I don't have the power to make an upgrade. So, I'll have to go with=20
sleep. Thanks for clearing that up!

Dear Developers,

I installed "fvwm-2.4.15" as an "rpm" package under Linux RedHat 7.2.
There is a bug: from time to time, while launching the Nedit editor FVWM
produces the window without the title bar, and with WindowListSkip and
Sticky properties turned on.

There were no such problem with previous versions of FVWM, so I attribute
this bug to FVWM rather than to Nedit.

Best regards,

Michael Lashkevich

Might "from time to time" have something to do with the window
title?  If you edit a file, it's name shows up in nedit's title
bar.  If that title matches a style definition, that style is
applied to the window title.  E.g. if you have

  Style FvwmButtons NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip

and run

  $ nedit FvwmButtons

this would cause the described effect.

Bye

No, no. It happens quite randomly. I have no files like "FvwmButtons".
Besides, when it happens, I close Nedit and restart it with the same
filename in the command line, and usually it starts again properly.

Hi,

I try to have a sticky XMMS on start, but it doesn't work...

I try both :

Style "XMMS*"	    Sticky, CirculateSkip, CirculateSkipIcon
Style "xmms*"	    Sticky, CirculateSkip, CirculateSkipIcon

But sticky doesn't work ! (Circulate Skip works perfectly !)

I have to manually stick xmms window and xmms playlist each time...

Thx for help

I am sorry, you are right. It takes place when I start "nedit --server
.alwaysblock", but I have a line

Style "*lock" NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip

in my ".fvwm2rc".

Best regards and thank you for a prompt answer,

Michael

In my xmms menu I've (my locale is fr, but I think this is ok for
you) Options --> Adsifs. If I enable this option, then my xmms
is sticky.

At work we decided to dump XWinPro that we have used 'til now to access
the Linux servers and start to use Cygwin on the local PCs (to lighted the
burdon on the develop machine).

So I sacrificed a few hours this evening to get my script-based FVWM
config working and compiled 2.5.6 (since I use some cutting-edge features,
such as my vector button pixel offsets :-) ).

Mostly it works nice (except a lot of programs not present (like
ROX-filer, but no big deal, an RXVT is sufficent).
Though the keybindings are not working.

For example I have:

Key F1           R       N       Menu MainMenu
Key F1           A       M       Menu MainMenu

But when I press F1, I get the _built in_ Root menu.
Also I have Alt+F4 bound to "Close", this is intercepted ny the
"surrounding" Windows window, and asks if I really want to kill the
X-Server (I don't).

Is there some way around this?

(I really like the idea of not running Metacity and Bluecurve, the
"official" WM to use in Cygwin is wmaker. I would rather run FVWM. I hope
if I get it to work nicely, my boss might let me use it... :-) )

That might be the case, but would the built in keybinding take presedence
then? Is it defined both with and without numlock?

The builtin binding is:

Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot

So, any modifier is OK.

If the XFree window is grabbing the binding, perhaps there is something
in XFree that could be changed.

I suspect that is the only way.  Windoze will interpret AltF4 as
"close current window", and the application (Cygwin) will get a
Close event which will be indistinguishable from what it would
see if you had selected Close from the (Windoze) File menu.

It's conceivable that there's some registry hack to have Windoze
use something else instead of AltF4 -- if so, it might be mentioned
in some of the Cygwin or VNC docs/FAQs/whatever -- or you could put
in a request to the Cygwin developers for Cygwin to

* automatically respond "no", instead of asking whether to kill the
  X-Server, and

* Pass the Close event to the X-server as an Alt+F4.

Either way, there's not much FVWM can do about it :(

Hi,

here is something I want to share. I found a very simple way to realize a 
run dialog (similar to grun, tkrun, etc.) using an rxvt. The trick is to 
bind the string " &\nexit\n" (I'm using bash) to the return key.

To start the dialog I created the following script:

.fvwm/run-dialog:
    #!/bin/sh
    rxvt +sb -name fvwm-run-dialog -title "run" -geometry 80x1+224+360 \  
    --keysym.0xFF0D: " &\nexit\n" -e bash --init-file \
    $HOME/.fvwm/run-dialog.bash-init

As an initialization script for bash it uses:

.fvwm/run-dialog.bash-init:
    export PS1=""

And in my .fvwm2rc I put:

    Style fvwm-run-dialog GrabFocus
    Key R A 4 Exec exec $[HOME]/.fvwm/run-dialog

Now, I can start the dialog using "Win-R".

Felix

Why not just use FvwmForm?

I bring you a shimmer of hope (as I've used Cygwin's X server before--it
makes using Win32 a much less painful experience ;) -- Although fvwm
can't do anything about Windows grabbing alt-f4, the X server can: start
the X server with -nowinkill to disable alt-f4, and consider starting it
with -unixkill to make ctrl-alt-backspace do the same thing.

The command line options are documented in
http://xfree86.cygwin.com/docs/ug/cygwin-xfree-ug.pdf, which contains a
few other interesting options.  You might be interested in -fullscreen,
and -rootless exists in newer versions, although it's not documented in
that pdf.  I've personally found that -rootless is a little kludgy, and
I don't recommend it if you have edge flipping enabled as fvwm creates
small windows at each corner which will look strange without the rest of
the root window.

Dan Espen's numlock theory sounds likely for your F1 problem--don't
forget that you can use IgnoreModifiers if your PC turns on numlock at
boot and you can't turn that off.

Hope that helps,

Hello,

I have been running fvwm for quite a long time and the autoraise
feature is the one I absolutely rely on. However I can't get it
working with cygwin fvwm. I am running win2k and

$ fvwm2 -version
FVWM version 2.4.7 compiled on May 11 2002 at 22:38:40
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM

and when in debugging mode I get

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Fail to read (Module: 0, read: 3, size: 4)
[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor from '(null)':
- data available=Y
- terminate signal=N

every time I restart the FvwmAuto module. My .fvwm2rc is quite simple with


######################## Initialization Functions ############################
AddToFunc InitFunction  "I" exec xsetroot -solid grey50 &
+                       "I" exec xset b off &

Any help is greatly appreciated ...

thanks

Hi,

Currently I'm using two monitors with xfree xinerema.
I'm using fvwm 2.5.6
Formerly when using 2.4.10 everything worked fine.

But currently, when I click on my desktop the "menu" will always show up on
the first screen, even if I'm clicking on the second on.
Afterwards the program will show up on the screen where my mouse is, so this
is working fine.

It is also not possible for me to move the pager to the second screen!
With FvwmButtons  everything works fine again. 
(Both I give the geometry addon -0-0 (so top right corner).

I haven't looked at it. But I doubt that it is as simple to set up. In 
addition, with rxvt and bash I have tab completion. Is this possible with 
an FvwmForm based solution?

Sigh!  Can't we have a mail filter that redirects all mails with
the word "xmms" to the xmms mailing list?  Regarding window
management it is really a piece of crap.

Can you provide a minimal config file for that and detailed
instructions how I can reproduce it?

And if it's not too inconvenient, please disable your Xinerama X
setup (so you have only one screen) and configure fvwm with the
--enable-xinerama-emulation option instead.  You will see some
white or black lines dividing the viewport into several "screens".
Does the problem happen with this setup too?

I think its pretty simple to set up, but it doesn't have tab completion.

Hi,
I have seperated my .fvwm file in a few loose files, please find them attached.
I've done this to speed up things when in need for a change,
(I now some thing probably ain't that neat)

Furthermore my config file is a shoot off of one of the example ones and
then turned over into this peace of homebrew :)

I'm going to try with the emulation next, so I'll come back later
to put on the results!

Thanks
Marc

# For the benefit of emacs users: -*- shell-script -*-
# Configuration file for FVWM 2.xx originally by Lars Wirzenius
# modifications by Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>, copyright March 1999
# adopeted for fvwm 2.4 by Alexander Kotelnikov <sacha@debian.org> August 2001
#
#
# This file can be used both as the system.fvwmrc and the per-user 
# ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
# It uses certain `hooks' (files stored in /etc/X11/fvwm or ~/.fvwm) to allow
# the system administrator and user to modify menus, colors, and so on without
# having to change this file.
#
# The defaults that this file sets up follow my own taste.  They attempt to set
# up a nice, easy, comfortable environment for the "ordinary" user.  However,
# using the hooks, it should be possible to change anything.
#
# Please read /usr/share/doc/fvwm/README.sysrc.gz for more information.
#
# Hopefully, you will never have to modify this file.
#

#
# Section: pre.hook
#
# Use pre.hook for things that need to be done before anything else.
# For example, various paths (IconPath, PixmapPath, ModulePath) might
# be defined here.
#


ImagePath /usr/local/share/icons:/usr/share/icons:/usr/share/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/share/icons:/usr/share/icons:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/X11R6/include/bitmaps:/usr/share/fvwm/images:/home/marc/.fvwm/images

#ModulePath /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.6 
#
# Section: Various global settings
#
# These settings are personal.
# If you need to modify them, do so in post.hook.
#

#
# DeskTopSize sets the size of the desktop in units of physical screen
# `pages'.  I prefer to use a single desktop with multiple pages,
# but many people like having multiple desktops.  I thinks its confusing.
#

DeskTopSize 2x2

#
# I like to be able to move between pages or desks simply by moving
# the mouse against the screen border.  I find it very useful.  The
# following command enables this behaviour.  To disable it, the
# command EdgeScroll 0 0 could be placed in the post.hook.
#

EdgeScroll 100 100

#
# When moving a window against the edge of the screen, it is
# nice to have a small resistance before the window is moved outside
# the screen.  This makes it easier to line windows against the
# edges.  I have also added some resistance to scrolling at the edges
# of the screen
#

EdgeResistance 250 100
OpaqueMoveSize 50

#
# Section: Styles, colors, fonts, and related things
#
# This section defines the looks, behavior, and other attributes of windows.
# These are also quite personal.  Modify them in post.hook.
#

#
# The following sets window colors.  This is highly personal,
# of course, and I (jdg) have changed it to something I like!!  Feel
# free to destroy my choices in your post.hook!!
#

# Put the defaults in a separate decor so decor users can ignore them

# Section: Mouse bindings
#
# This section defines the mouse bindings, that is, all the things that
# can be done with the mouse.
#

#
# Each button gives a different menu from the background (root window).
#

Mouse 1   R  A  Menu root-menu
Mouse 2   R  A  Menu Window-Ops 
Mouse 3   R  A  WindowList

#
# Moving and resizing, depending on which part of the window
# you grab (T=title bar, S=side/top/bottom, F=corner).
#

Mouse 0 T A move-and-raise-or-raiselower
#This caused problems with emacs selection (Bug #17668).
#Mouse 0 W M move-and-raise-or-raiselower
Mouse 0 W M   -
Mouse 0 F A resize-or-raiselower
Mouse 0 S A resize-or-raiselower

#
# Move or de-iconify an icon.
#

Mouse 0 I A move-or-winmenu-or-deiconify

#
# Buttons on the title bar (1,3,5,7,9 are on the left, 0,8,6,4,2 on
# the right side of the title bar).  Note that the bindings here
# make more sense if the ButtonStyle's defined earlier are retained.
#

#Mouse 0 2 A Popup Window-Ops

Mouse 0 1 A Close
Mouse 0 3 A Maximize 100 100

Mouse 0 5 A Iconify

#
# Section: Key bindings
#
# This section binds some actions to keys.  The bindings have been inspired
# by MWM, Windows, and nightmares.  Everything that these key bindings do,
# can be done without them.  Therefore they should not be too much of a
# burden on new users, but it definitely _can_ be confusing to press a
# key by accident and have it do something completely unexpected.

Yes, this works just fine!

I now use -nowinkill -unixkill -fullscreen
I will redefine alt+tab in Fvwm.

And good news is that my boss looked at the config and was quite satified,
especially about the pager (ability to drag between desks and out from
desks onto current screen).
So I might get the task to set up an official central Cygwin installation
with FVWM as the default WM :-)

Hi,

I use vmware with fvwm 2.5.5, and the MouseFocusClickRaises style.  I
just sent this email to the vmware support forum:

	I use vmware under a window manager with a focus-follows-mouse
	policy.  When windows are in front of the vmware window, vmware
	won't release the mouse cursor until the mouse moves outside the
	boundary of the vmware window, even though there is a window in
	front of the vmware window that should receive the focus.  This
	only happens when the cursor has been grabbed by vmware (it's the
	arrow, not the hand).

	In these cases, the cursor disappears behind the window in front,
	resulting in confusing behavior.  I expect that when the pointer
	moves from vmware to a window that partially obscures the vmware
	window, the focus should transfer to the window in front.  However
	vmware retains the focus until the pointer exits the vmware window,
	at which point focus switches to the window beneath the cursor.

	I have seen this problem with both fvwm (version 2.5.5) and sawfish
	(version 1.2) window managers.

Normally I would categorize this as a vmware bug, but in some cases fvwm
is also at fault.  Sometimes, even though I move the mouse outside the
vmware window, focus doesn't transfer to the window on top, but rather
remains inside the vmware window.  So I can get into a situation, where
the focus is in one window, but my cursor is quite obviously in a
different window.

Unfortunately, it only happens sometimes.  But it happens dozens of
times a day, and it gets to be rather annoying.

Any ideas?  Has this been fixed in a newer version of fvwm?

This is normal, because vmware want's to simulate windows within
an "new" computer it make sure that there is no confusion
about wat belong's to what. I now there is a copy/paste possibility
but regarding mouse and keyboard the made sure thing go right.


Ever tried pressing ctrl-alt to remove mouse from the vmware screen?
This results that the vmware box is treated as a normal fvwm window.
Afterwards, it is possible to click into vmware to get back.

This ain't an fvwm bug, and certainly also ain't an vmware bug.
Fvwm can't do a thing about it because vmware set's these proparties.
vmware acts like a normal fvwm window, but inside vmware it has full control about how the new box works, and it needs to do that to fully simulate the new
computer.


Regards,
Marc

Thanks.  I need a couple of days to make my Xinerama setup work
again, but I will look at that problem soon.

My guess is that vmware grabs all mouse events when the pointer
enters its window.  I am sure there *is* a vmware bug since it
should release the grab when the pointer leaves its window, since
you seems to have set it up to behave this way.

About focus not being transferred outside the vmware window:  when
the pointer is (un)grabbed, X generates EnterNotify and
LeaveNotify for the windows involved.  It is important to ignore
some of these events.  For example, if you have something like

  mouse 1 a csm Next (xterm) Focus

You would not want that the EnterNotify for the window under the
pointer that is generated when the automatic pointer grab is
released makes fvwm focus the window that already had the focus.  
There are delicate heuristics in fvwm that try to guess which have
to be ignored and which do not.  But there is no way to make it
work hundred percent reliably.

  I am trying to have a different background pixmap for highlighted 
entries ( Items ) in a menu ), is this possible and where shall I look , 
( I have been doing quite a lot of rtfm .. and I suspect that I can 
define some kind of HighliteForeground for each item to slve this.

  Second, how can I use pixmaps on an FvwmTaskBar ?

  cheers, Lars Segerlund.

I don't think the problem is related to vmware.

Just now I was able to reproduce the focus problem with evolution and an
xterm.  Evolution was on top, partially obscuring the xterm behind it.
When I moved my mouse pointer from evolution to the xterm, evolution
remained in focus.  I was able to reproduce it a couple times in quick
succession.

I don't understand how this example relates to the evolution/xterm
interaction I described above.  All I did was move my mouse from one
window to the other.  There should be one LeaveNotify and one
EnterNotify.

Is there a way to configure fvwm to forbid application focus and "on
top" or "front" unless I specifically take action to focus the window
or bring it to the front?

I have a habit of starting several applications, then going back to
web-browsing for a while; and would like to find a stopping point in my
web-browsing before dealing with whatever application I started. I just
want the application to start and behave itself quietly in the
background.

The faq wasn't revealing any easy way to do this, and google wasn't
much help either.

Is it possible to do this, is there a reason I'm not thinking of for
why this wouldn't be desirable?

Not sure that I understand you right, but I think you are looking for
StartsOnPage (or StartsOnDesk) which is described in the FAQ (7.3).

I forgot to mention that you probably want to use this together with
SkipMapping which also is mentioned in the FAQ (7.3).

I don't believe this is possible, this is from the man page:

              ActiveColorset works exactly like MenuColorset, but
              the foreground from the colorset replaces the color
              given with the ActiveFore menu style and  the  col=AD
              orset's  background  color replaces the color given
              with the HilightBack command (to turn on background
              hilighting  you  have  to  use the HilightBack menu
              style too).  If specified, the hilight  and  shadow
              colors  from the colorset are used too.  The pixmap
              and shape mask from  the  colorset  are  not  used.
              Hilighting  the  background  or  foreground  can be
              turned off individually with the  ActiveForeOff  or
              HilightBackOff menu styles.

(The part about the pixmap not being used.)

>   Second, how can I use pixmaps on an FvwmTaskBar ?

Use colorsets, something like this:

Colorset 0 pixmap weird10.xpm
*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset 0

Thanks for the tip; but its not quite what I want. I don't want
applications to start up on any given desktop or page. I want them to
be able to start up anywhere; and I want them never to be able to
steal my focus or my viewspace. It may be that what I want is
impossible though, so this is a good back up solution. Thanks

It almost sounds as if you want them to start iconified.

I don't think it's impossible; I believe that it could be done with a
function, although I'm too tired to come up with something right at the
moment. :-/

That would probably do half of it; the other half is I have a couple
of misbehaved applications that, during the course of execution, try
to steal my focus and attention. I can't get away from the
applications, they're part of my job; what I'd like to do is force
them to behave by refusing to give them focus when they demand it.

You may want to try

  Style * StartsLowered

To prevent new windows from grabbing the focus, use

  Style * !GrabFocus, !GrabFocusTransient

in 2.5.x or the older syntax for 2.4.x:

  Style * GrabFocusOff, GrabFocusTransientOff

No, its not possible because with the way fvwm's menus are
implemented, this would be way too slow.  The whole menu would be
redrawn every time you select a new item.  Some time in the future
perhaps.

Well, this part can't be done without cooperation of the
application.  If it takes the focus itself there is little you can
do since X does not ask the window manager for confirmation when a
window steals the focus.  Possible solutions:

 1) Use FvwmEvent to transfer the focus back to the previous
    window when one of the said windows steals the focus.  It will
    be difficult to define what is an acceptable transfer of focus
    and what is not.  And you might still lose a couple of
    keystrokes in the process.

 2) Reserve a separate desk (not page) for these applications.
    Since their windows are never mapped while you are on another
    desk, they will hopefully not be able to steal the focus.

If you are lucky, the application use X's urgency hint to take
hold of the focus.  When fvwm receives such a message, it
executes the predefined UrgencyFunc on the window and gives it the
focus in the process.  In that case deleting the UrgencyFunc (see
man page) will help:

  DestroyFunc UrgencyFunc

Can I try out any of the misbehaved apps myself?

Bye

Dear Sir,
Do not be surprised about this letter to you as I got your contact through my =
mother. My name is Godstime Nkomo the last born of late Joshua Nkomo the =
former Vice President of Zimbabwe and Former President of Zimbabwe African =
People's Union (ZAPU). However, I was studying in a boarding high school when =
I had to forcefully return for my father=92s burial. After the burial, my =
father's lawyer notified the family about his Will in their chamber. While =
going through the will, I discovered that my father used his position as the =
Former Vice President to acquire and make a deposition of US$ 23 M =
{Twenty-three Million United States dollars} in a special Security Company in =
Amsterdam Holland with my name.
I immediately had to travel to Europe to ascertain the authenticity of the =
Deposit, which I have verified, and to seek asylum as a result of the =
interest of President Mugabe over my father assets. In Europe a financial =
Expert advised me on the best way to safe guard and realize usefully this =
funds without any problems from the Dutch authorities. This was to involve a =
foreigner, who will come down here to Holland, open a non-resident Bank =
account where the money will be deposited for onward transfer to any =
nominated account overseas as my refugee status limit=92s my opportunities =
here.
This is why I am making this contact with you now. You are to come down to =
Holland and assist me in getting the money out to your beautiful country =
where I and my family can make further investment of the money and where I =
can live a better life and have a better education as this is my life long =
dream. Here in Holland, The labor law act of Holland and my politically =
exiled life from President Mugabe and Zimbabwean Authorities has eliminated =
any chances of my owning an account freely.
Please, do contact me with my Tel No above  indicating your interest and =
capability for more details. You are entitled to 20% of the total amount for =
assisting me; I have mapped out 3% for immediate re-imbursement for expenses =
upon your arrival here, while the rest will be for me, and my family members, =
which I would like to invest in your country under your close supervision and =
direction of which you will be entitled to 10% of the after tax returns on =
investment of my share. Note: The content of the consignment is US$ 23 =
million cash money, but the Security Company does not know the actual content =
of the consignment because it was deposited by my father with a declaration =
that the content is precious metals and diamond valued at US$ 23 M, and this =
was done with diplomatic immunity and for security reason, at the time, my =
father was still in government in my country Zimbabwe.
This transaction is basically risk-free for you; therefore, reach me, =
preferably with the above stated phone number to ensure the security of this =
transaction. Note that it is because of the confidential nature of this =
transaction that I am giving you this contact info. Which you can use to =
reach me as soon as possible.
Awaiting your immediate, urgent contact!
Yours Faithfully,
GODSTIME NKOMO

It seems my AGP port stopped worked.
So now I sit with an old S3 card I found in a drawer in the 
sysadmin's room at work.
The card has only 1 MB VRAM. So I tried to run 1024x768 in 8-bit mode.
But colours in FVWM is screwed up (white is blue). Does it depend on the
X-server? (The test provided by Xconfigurator (Redhat) seems quite OK).

I use FvwmBacker to show backround XPMs, but should FVWM allocate it's
colourmap before, since FvwmBacker is started from FVWM?

Or do I need to tell FVWM to use more colours?
What I find is the command line option -l.
It says in the manpage it uses colourcubes, doesn't this mean pure white
should be available.

No, you want to tell it to use *less* colours.  Try starting fvwm
with "--color-limit <number of colours>" to reduce the number of
colours used in pictures.  You should also use private colour maps
on all applications that support it (a la "netscape -install") and
refine the colours used in your applications so that they all use
the same colours.

Pure black and white are always available.  Hm.

I think, if the application requests a read-write color, there may
be a second attempt to allocate another white color cell.

Por favor leia at ao fim, so apenas 3 ou 4 minutos que podero mudar o
resto da sua vida. Se no tem tempo agora, deixe para mais logo mas leia
com calma. Isto  um assunto muito srio, encare-o como tal.


Factos:
Pode perder seis euros (no mximo dos mximos) o que no  propriamente uma fortuna.
Vai gastar 10 minutos do seu tempo.
Vai precisar duma caixa multibanco.
Pode ganhar muito dinheiro (mas mesmo muito).

Como? Basta ler e perceber as instrues.

Vamos a isto!

INSTRUES

1.  Deposite 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta de cada uma das seis pessoas que
esto indicadas na listagem abaixo. Isto pode ser feito de duas formas:
(1) transferncia bancaria em qualquer caixa multibanco, atravs do NIB indicado ou (2) depsito na conta-corrente, usando o n que est na listagem.

2. Quando depositar Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta-corrente das seis pessoas da lista, envie um e-mail para cada uma delas com o seguinte texto: "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja includo no seu cadastro de correspondncias".
Esta  a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operao bancaria e fica de acordo com a legislao vigente. A legislao diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servio.
Este  o servio! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depsitos na sua conta-corrente faro o mesmo.)

3. Aps ter depositado Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) em cada uma das seis pessoas,
tire o nome da que esta no nmero 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posio acima (o segundo nome passa para o n 1, o
terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em nenhuma hiptese mude a sequncia de nomes. No coloque o seu nome numa posio diferente, porque alm de no ser eticamente correcto, s o vai prejudicar.

4. Coloque no seu "livro de endereos" aproximadamente 250  nomes/e-mails.
Esta  a parte mais complicada da tarefa. Tente consegui-los atravs de alguma empresa que fornea listagens de e-mails, u tente consegui-los de qualquer outra forma (em classificados por exemplo). Quantos mais melhor.

5. Completada a etapa anterior (4), envie esta mensagem para esses e-mails.

6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrues deste programa e dentro de
aproximadamente 90 dias voc poder receber, se as pessoas para quem voc enviou os e-mails entrarem, mais de 100.000,00 Euros (Cem mil Euros). Eu sei,  muito dinheiro....

COMO FUNCIONA
Digamos que voc tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3% dos e-mails enviados, o que  uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas minhas duas tentativas tive mais do que 3% de retorno.
1.	Quando voc manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca de 7 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
2.	Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro
3.	Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
4.	Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
5.	Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 21.937 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
6.	Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 164.527 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.

E segue assim, numa progresso geomtrica. Em algum ponto o seu nome sair da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas. Mas, voce recebeu
aproximadamente Euros 199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso funciona sempre. No exemplo acima, voc ter enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce enviar 1.000 cartas/e-mails, pode chegar a receber Euros 898.072,00 - que foi o que recebi. Fantstico, no e verdade?

EIS A RELAO DAS PESSOAS PARA AS QUAIS VOC FAR O DEPOSITO BANCRIO OU TRANSFERENCIA BANCARIA - Euro 1,00.

OBS.: - (Basta chegar a qualquer dependncia do banco em questo e requerer para fazer o deposito naquele numero de conta ou simplesmente fazer uma transferencia bancaria via Internet (caso tenha esse servio disponvel com o seu banco) ou por Multibanco, utilizando sempre para o efeito o NIB da conta).

Por favor leia at ao fim, so apenas 3 ou 4 minutos que podero mudar o
resto da sua vida. Se no tem tempo agora, deixe para mais logo mas leia
com calma. Isto  um assunto muito srio, encare-o como tal.


Factos:
Pode perder seis euros (no mximo dos mximos) o que no  propriamente uma fortuna.
Vai gastar 10 minutos do seu tempo.
Vai precisar duma caixa multibanco.
Pode ganhar muito dinheiro (mas mesmo muito).

Como? Basta ler e perceber as instrues.

Vamos a isto!

INSTRUES

1.  Deposite 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta de cada uma das seis pessoas que
esto indicadas na listagem abaixo. Isto pode ser feito de duas formas:
(1) transferncia bancaria em qualquer caixa multibanco, atravs do NIB indicado ou (2) depsito na conta-corrente, usando o n que est na listagem.

2. Quando depositar Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) na conta-corrente das seis pessoas da lista, envie um e-mail para cada uma delas com o seguinte texto: "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja includo no seu cadastro de correspondncias".
Esta  a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operao bancaria e fica de acordo com a legislao vigente. A legislao diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servio.
Este  o servio! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depsitos na sua conta-corrente faro o mesmo.)

3. Aps ter depositado Euro 1,00 (Um Euro) em cada uma das seis pessoas,
tire o nome da que esta no nmero 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posio acima (o segundo nome passa para o n 1, o
terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em nenhuma hiptese mude a sequncia de nomes. No coloque o seu nome numa posio diferente, porque alm de no ser eticamente correcto, s o vai prejudicar.

4. Coloque no seu "livro de endereos" aproximadamente 250  nomes/e-mails.
Esta  a parte mais complicada da tarefa. Tente consegui-los atravs de alguma empresa que fornea listagens de e-mails, u tente consegui-los de qualquer outra forma (em classificados por exemplo). Quantos mais melhor.

5. Completada a etapa anterior (4), envie esta mensagem para esses e-mails.

6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrues deste programa e dentro de
aproximadamente 90 dias voc poder receber, se as pessoas para quem voc enviou os e-mails entrarem, mais de 100.000,00 Euros (Cem mil Euros). Eu sei,  muito dinheiro....

COMO FUNCIONA
Digamos que voc tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3% dos e-mails enviados, o que  uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas minhas duas tentativas tive mais do que 3% de retorno.
1.	Quando voc manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca de 7 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
2.	Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro
3.	Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
4.	Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
5.	Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 21.937 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.
6.	Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 164.527 pessoas lhe mandam 1 Euro.

E segue assim, numa progresso geomtrica. Em algum ponto o seu nome sair da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas. Mas, voce recebeu
aproximadamente Euros 199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso funciona sempre. No exemplo acima, voc ter enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce enviar 1.000 cartas/e-mails, pode chegar a receber Euros 898.072,00 - que foi o que recebi. Fantstico, no e verdade?

EIS A RELAO DAS PESSOAS PARA AS QUAIS VOC FAR O DEPOSITO BANCRIO OU TRANSFERENCIA BANCARIA - Euro 1,00.

OBS.: - (Basta chegar a qualquer dependncia do banco em questo e requerer para fazer o deposito naquele numero de conta ou simplesmente fazer uma transferencia bancaria via Internet (caso tenha esse servio disponvel com o seu banco) ou por Multibanco, utilizando sempre para o efeito o NIB da conta).

Hi,

Why FVWM grab the server whenever I move or resize windows?
All the other applications stopped updating the display that
time.

I think that's not good to grab the server. How can FVWM not to
do it?

Thanks.

FVWM needs to grab the X server to draw the XOR'd frame type it normally
uses.  You can change the move/resize style by putting this in your
fvwm2rc file:

Style "*" ResizeOpaque
OpaqueMoveSize -1

I use OpaqueMoveSize -1,

What version of fvwm are you running?

When you move a window does the whole window move or
just an outline?

I'm running fvwm 2.5.6.
The window move as a whole, not an outline.

Oh. It seems it's not grabbing the server now.
It's problem of xdaliclock, not FVWM.

This looks indeed nice but it doesn't have tab completion. Anyways, with all 
these little hacks another idea comes into my mind:

Wouldn't it be nice to have a Wiki on the FVWM homepage where people can 
post their hacks and read about other peoples hacks?

Sorry for not answering until now.
Email, lately, has been painful.  I'm getting a spam barrage of
monumental proportions.  (Well, anyway, it's a lot of spam.)

As I understand it a wiki is a bunch of web sites linked together.
Fvwm does have a links page.  Isn't that sufficient?

No, you're thinking of a web ring.

A Wiki is a site where the content is user-modifiable, at any time,
simply by using your browser.  You write content in "Wiki style" which
is a very simple textual markup, like *bold*, _italic_, etc.  You can
make simple lists and headers, and most allow for the creation of simple
tables as well.

A Wiki is just about the best/least expensive way I've seen to have real
collaborative self-support on the web.

Just something which might be of interest - some old hack of mine -
needs to be updated, and polished up a bit, but is generally useful
to me - written in C, though, so it has to be compiled, but it has 
the advantage of customizability through X resources and actions:

Hello all,

How do I get StubbornIcons in fvwm2.4.15?

All the documentation (FAQ/man pages/Google)
that I looked at simply said this has been
obsoleted. Does that mean it is no longer
possible to have StubbornIcons, or that there
is an alternative way to get this effect?

Thanks for any help,
Mandar.

StubbornIcons was an fvwm1 feature:

Changes de-iconification behavior a bit. Instead of having windows
always de-iconify themselves on the current page they de-iconify into
their original position.


I don't think there is an equivalent fvwm2 feature.
Maybe someone else on the list can think of something.

I don't entirely get the distinction.  AFAIK, when I iconify an app, the
icon goes on the same page where the window was.  In order to de-iconify
by double-clicking the icon, I must be on that same page, and the app
window appears there (in its original position).  I just tried (in 2.2.4)
de-iconifying via the window list while on a different page, and the app
window still reappeared on its original page (where its icon had been),
and in its original position.  Thus it seems that what is described as
StubbornIcon behavior is now in some sense the normal behavior.  Is there
a third de-iconification method which I'm not thinking of?

FvwmEvent can presumably be made to do almost anything :)

I'd have to bring up 1.24r to verify, but I think stubborn icons
work like this:

You iconify on page 1, then uniconify.
Then move the window to page 2. Then iconify.
It iconifies on page 1.

Without a shifting of the viewport, I'm not sure.

The behaviour I would like is the following:

I want all icons to be sticky, but windows should be
de-iconified to their original positions.

For example, say I have netscape on page 3. I iconify 
it. I move to page 1. I want the netscape icon to follow
me to page 1. But when I de-iconify netscape, fvwm should 
take me back to page 3. 

A combination of StickyIcons and StubbornIcons gave me
this behaviour with fvwm1.24r. I haven't been able to
figure out how to get this with fvwm2.4.15.

Right now, I'm looking at the man pages for IconBox and
IconMan to see if I can use those modules to get what I
want.

Mandar.

If the icon intersects the current page, deiconifying also puts
the window on the current page.  You usually won't notice that
unless you use StickyIcons.

Ok, I tried out FvwmWinList and that serves my purpose.
The WinList is sticky, so I see all icons, no matter
what page I am on. I can bind the mouse buttons so that
clicking on an icon takes me to that window on the
appropriate page.

I am fairly new at trying to configure fvwm so please bear with me.

In the following configuration

*BarButtons: (Swallow (NoClose, UseOld) "bubblemon" "Exec exec bubblemon -d -k")

The bubblemon display has a border at the top and left sides if the button.
is this supposed to be like this?  Or should be display fill the entire
button?  Or can a border be placed at the right and bottom edges as well?

I realize it's probably doing it this way since it want to appear like a
depressable button.  But since this isn't really a button, the border doesn't
seem to me to be quite right.

I am using fvwm 2.4.15.

Thanks!

I am trying the latest stable 2.4.15 with the rc file
copied from sample/system.fvwm2rc
Everything seems to be working except I can't start rxvt
from the menu.
I can start rvxt from a xterm without a problem, but if
I start it from the "root menu" (left click mouse), it
gives the following errors and flashes/quits.
starting xterm from "root menu" works fine.
I am using qnx.
Any ideas?
thanks!

Do I have to have four pager desktops?  I really only want a single desktop
with 6 pages.  I've tried a few things but it seems that I always get 4
desktops even if I can only view one at a time.

As written in the man page:

     The (m by n) size (i.e. number  of  pages)  of  the  virtual
     desktops  can  be changed any time, by using the DeskTopSize
     built-in command.  All virtual desktops must  be  (are)  the

So this controls the number of pages in the desk, not the number of desks.

Sorry, desks are on the FvwmPager command line:

I guess you want:

It depends on many things, for example on other buttons.
To force a specific button size (64x64 in this case) do:

  *BarButtons: ButtonGeometry 64x64+0+0

To disable the 3d look, do:

  *BarButtons: Frame 0

You may also control the free space between the button frame and its
contents using:

  *BarButtons: Padding 0

There are more options, all are described in the FvwmButtons man page.

Mikhael.

since I don't have this rxvt (2.7.10) problem with other
window managers (eg: blackbox). I looked at how they
spawn the child (rxvt). It seems they don't do "close(0)"
after the "fork".  so I tried to comment out close(0)
in "fvwm/builtins.c" and now my rxvt starts fine !!

Any side effect by commenting out that line? I guess
we may be ok since other people don't do it :)

ideas?

thanks!
frank

The close was put in because gmplayer wouldn't start since
it thought it was in an interactive environment.

It depends on many things, for example on other buttons.
To force a specific button size (64x64 in this case) do:

  *BarButtons: ButtonGeometry 64x64+0+0

To disable the 3d look, do:

  *BarButtons: Frame 0

You may also control the free space between the button frame and its
contents using:

  *BarButtons: Padding 0

There are more options, all are described in the FvwmButtons man page.

Mikhael.

Hello all, 

I like to make screenschoots from fullscreen but with some opened menus... 

How does it work ??? 

On each keyboard there is a button 'Print' so I like to use it for this. 
Has anyone done this before ??? - and if yes,  - HOW ???

Thanks in advance
Michelle

As I know, it is a Fvwm-Buit-In.

Curently I try to make a 'light' FvwmControllcenter.

Yes right, it does not work for Windows which can 
change the Contents of the Titlebar like Mozilla.

Style "mozilla"     NoTitle

If you want to use xwd, do something like:

key Print Exec /bin/sh -c 'sleep 10;xwd -root -out /tmp/xwd.out'

bind it to the printscreen key, hit the key, then activate the
menu.

Sorry accidently replied to the person not the list

Alt-PgDn and Alt-PgUp will still cycle through 4 desktops - only the desktops
won't be labeled.  Does that mean they exist or they do not?


I don't know whether they exist, I guess they do, but I guess an infinite number of desktops exits. 
This behaviour is set in the file bindings 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Page Up/Page Down keys are used to scroll by one desktop page
# in any context, press page up/down + control + alt
# in root context, just pressing page up/down is OK
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Next        A       CM      Desk  -1 0 0 3
Key Next        R       M       Desk  -1 0 0 3
Key Prior       A       CM      Desk  +1 0 0 3
Key Prior       R       M       Desk  +1 0 0 3  


Again the 3 is the number of desktops-1 you use.

If you have ImageMagick installed, I really suggest to use "import
-window root screenshot.png". It supports dozens of image formats
including PNG/JPG/GIF, xwd only supports huge XWD files.

submenus too click on the submenu, move the cursor on the submenu and press backspace.

what is the command for do it? i'd like to map this action with another key
thanks,

Evolution seems to grab the focus away from the window under the cursor.
I can reproduce this with a very minimal config and fvwm 2.5.6.  I've
attached the config to this message.

To reproduce, start up Galeon (I have version 1.3.4) and Evolution (I
have 1.2.4) and an xterm.  Put galeon at the top of the screen and shade
it by double-clicking on its titlebar.  Arrange an xterm in front of the
Evolution.  (See http://ofb.net/~tlau/fvwm-focus.png for a screenshot.)
Move the cursor back and forth between the galeon and the xterm.  After
a few tries, the focus will "stick" to the Evolution window even though
the mouse cursor is actually in the xterm.  On my system, I can
reproduce the failure mode about 10% of the time.

Here's my ~/.fvwm2rc:

Style "*" FocusFollowsMouse

DestroyFunc Shade
AddToFunc   Shade
+ "I" Raise
+ "M" Move
+ "D" WindowShade

Mouse   1       T       A       Shade

I just upgraded from fvwm 2.2.2 to 2.4.15.  Used the win95 setup script as
the basis for my configuration, teaking it as neeed for my use.

Since the upgrade, dialogue boxes displayed by the application I am
developing no longer are decorated with a title bar.  What happened?  Which
setting might control this or where should I be looking?

Thanks for your help.  This is a real problem for me.

I've modified the win95 setup script to suit my needs and would like to use
the right panel mechanism used by the 'desker'.  Unfortunately, I am having
trouble getting the syntax to do it right.

I am displaying my modified version of 'BarButtons; in the upper left corner
of the screen.  I use the following confiugration commands:

Style BarButtons  NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 4, CirculateSkip

DestroyModuleConfig BarButtons: *
*BarButtons: Fore Black
*BarButtons: Back #c3c3c3
*BarButtons: Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*BarButtons: Geometry +1+1
*BarButtons: Rows 1
*BarButtons: BoxSize smart

*BarButtons: (2x1, Swallow "FvwmPagerPager" 'FvwmPager FvwmPagerPager 0 0')
##*BarButtons: (Swallow (NoClose, UseOld) "bubblemon" "Exec exec bubblemon -d -k")
*BarButtons: (Title "xload", Swallow (NoClose, UseOld) "xload" \
              "Exec exec nice -16 \
              xload -nolabel -update 4 -bg grey59 -hl grey70 \
              -geometry -1500-1500")
*BarButtons: (Swallow (NoClose, UseOld) "wmCalClock" \
             'Exec wmCalClock -bc "#789C68" -tc black')

*BarButtons: (Icon mini.stick1.xpm, Action Stick)
*BarButtons: (Icon mini.cross.xpm, Action Delete)
*BarButtons: (Icon mini.bomb.xpm, Action Destroy)

*BarButtons: (End)
*BarButtons: (Title XTerm, Icon wterm.xpm, Action 'Exec "XTerm" xterm -bg beige -sl 1000 -ls -sb -T `uuname -l` &')

How do I adapt this so that I can have the BarButtons scroll right and left
and become visible/invisible?

Try searching your configuration file for "NoTitle".

Sure, I have NoTitle all over the place.  But it's with respect to
specifically named styles.  How do I derive from that why a dialogue from a
homegrown application should lose its title?  The app's windows all display
correctly.

Hi all,

I give up.  I tried searching all of the "man" pages and search engines 
on the Internet for how to do this, but came up dry.

Running the latest cygwin on Windows 98.  I installed all of the Xserver 
and fvwm from cygwin setup, as well as the xpm-.

It seems that fvwm doesn't want to install itself into the cygwin XFree86 
run system, so I added a line in startxwin.sh below the commented out 
line for twm that runs 'fvwm2 &'.  I couldn't see anything else to do, 
and now, when I run startxwin.sh, I get the fvwm but a huge amount of 
errors.  Also, when I try to shutdown the xserver, fvwm shuts down, but 
then it tries to continue running the Xserver until I shut that down 
explicitly with Alt-F4.

Here is the output from a run of startxwin.sh.  What am I missing?

Use FvwmIdent to get your windows Name, Class, and Resource.
One of your NoTitle settings is matching your application windows.

What version of fvwm are you running?

Fvwm can't seem to find any of your images.
Have you downloaded the icons package?
Have you set the ImagePath to point to the directory containing the icons?

This looks like Fvwm might be having a problem understanding backslashes.
Do you have a style command that looks like:

Style * xxxx \
  StaysOnTop

Is there a space after the backslash (there shouldn't be one).

On your issue with shutdown, stopping Fvwm doesn't have to stop
X.  If you want that to happen, the command to execute fvwm should
be the last commmand in your .xinitrc and there should be no ampersand
after the command.

To go further, I suspect that maybe you're experiencing
line-termination confusion. Maybe your fvwm configuration is CRLF
terminated (network standard) instead of Unix-traditional LF?

Cygwin now lets you choose line-termination preference when you
install it, so that might also have some bearing here.

I suppose that could account for all the errors.  If there
is some invisible character being added to the end of all the
pixmap names, Fvwm won't be able to find any of them.

I haven't fooled with Cygwin for a long time, I don't remember any
option like that.

It is unlikely that you use the opposite option, so the order does not
matter here, put this anywhere you want. Say, in ~/.fvwm/styles if you
use win-like config. Then Restart.

You may execute this command on the fly too, without Restart.

Thanks.  I added it to globalfeel since there were comments in that file
regarding transient windows.

I would like to add an item to my Fvwm menu that opens 6 Netscape
browser windows on one of my virtual desktops.

Each of the Netscape windows would open a different URL.

And the 6 Netscape windows would be arranged in tile fashion on the
screen, so I can see all at the same time and there is no overlapping of
windows.  (In other words, a grid of 2 rows and 3 columns.)

Any suggestions on how to do this?

I see several ways to do this. You may create a script that runs all
netscapes, so it is easier to test this from a command line before you
add try to do it from a menu.

1) Start 6 netscape processes and specify -geometry on the command line.
Choose sizes/positions accourding to your screen size to fit exactly.

2) Start 6 netscape processes and then (after 6 pairs of Exec+Wait)
run "FvwmRearrange -tile" (play with its options to do what you want).

To run more than one netscape, use these parameters:

  netscape -remote 'openURL(http://fvwm.org/, new-window)'

It is probably possible to solve your task without running 6 netscapes,
but you didn't say what is your task (probably out of topic here).
Anyway, you may create one local html page with <frame> tag that includes
any layout you want, for example 6 frames showing 6 different locations
arranged in a grid of 2 rows and 3 columns.

Regards,
Mikhael.

My Cygwin installation is Unix LF.

Ok, that helped a little. Thanks.  I ran dos2unix on all the files in my 
~/.fvwm directory and got rid of the syntax errors.

I am still not loading any of the *.xpm files because they are nowhere to 
be found!

Also, "xload" is nowhere to be found.

Help!  This seems to be a broken installation.  Should I be asking about 
this in the Cygwin/XFree86 list, instead?

Download the Fvwm icons package:

http://www.fvwm.org/download/icons.php
Install it then add an ImagePath command to your .fvwm2rc to point to
where you installed it.

> Also, "xload" is nowhere to be found.

Don't know.  xload is a pretty common X package, but I don't know
if its part of the Cygwin stuff.  I doubt a Unix perf meter will be useful
on w98, you should probably not worry about it.

I don't know.  Where did you get your fvwm config from?

I did this, and it is now a LOT better, but it is still missing a bunch 
of icons that the scripts are asking for.  The version that Cygwin uses 
is 2.4.7 with an extra "-2" on the version number, probably indicating 
Cygwin tweaks.

That's what I figured... the error message is irritating, tho...

It was part of the XFree binary download which is part of the Cygwin 
setup download.  I think I'll go to that list because my problems seem to 
be more related to the Cygwin/XFree86 packaging than any issues with fvwm 
as a whole.  Very nice package, and I hope I can get it to work fully!

Thanks again, everybody, for your help.

Hi,

when I call fvwm-menu-desktop as follows I only get a hierarchy of empty 
menus.

    export KDEDIR=/opt/kde3 # --install-prefix=/opt/kde3 doesn't work
    fvwm-menu-desktop --desktop kde-user

Is fvwm-menu-desktop just broken or am I doing something wrong?

Felix

It may or may not not support KDE 3 yet, but try this, it should work
more or less:

  fvwm-menu-desktop --dir /opt/kde3/share/applnk --wm-icons

Thanks, this does indeed work. However, I need the user menu (from 
/home/felix/.kde/applnk), not the system wide menu.

But I found the reason for my problem: The entries in the user menu were 
mostly created by CrossOver Office. For example:

    CrossOver Reset.desktop:
        # KDE Config File
        [Desktop Entry]
        Name=Reset CrossOver
        Exec="/home/felix/local/lib/cxoffice/bin/cxreset"  
        Type=Application
        Comment=
        X-Created-by=CrossOver Office
        Icon=/home/felix/local/lib/cxoffice/support/cxreset.xpm

The problem is the Exec line. If I change it for example to 
        Exec=xterm
then it works.

So now my question becomes: Why does fvwm-menu-desktop have problems with 
the above valid Exec line? Will this be fixed soon?

Felix

It seems to be that the check_app subroutine in fvwm-menu-desktop is broken. 
After using the option "--nocheck-app" everything works fine.

That sounds more like an Evolution bug (?).

Hello, everyone!

I am brand new to the list, figured I should introduce myself.  My 
name is Eduardo Alvarez, and I am brand new to FVWM.  Hopefully, I 
will like it enough to keep it.  I've used E and found it immensely 
bloated, Afterstep (and wished I could do some things I couldn't) and 
Window Maker (and promptly missed the pager).  

I hear that FVWM takes a lot more work to get things to do the way 
you like, but that the end result is well worth the effort.  I hope 
I succeed.

Hello,


Currently I use two monitors, a 17" and a 15".
I'm using fvwm 2.5.6

the following problem occurs,

I have the following options in my .fvwm2rc:
Xinerama True
XineramaSls False
Mouse 0 3 A Maximize 100 100


Wenn I maximize my windows, everything works fine.
So when I click maximize, the windows is maximized on
the monitor it is on. (So not spread over both monitors)

But wenn I click on the desktop on the second monitor,
still the menu turns up on the first. So it is not
possible to get the menu to turn up onder the pointer
on the second screen.

When I set "XineramaSls True" the menu problem is
solved, so the menu always turns up under the mouse pointer
also on the second screen, however, now the
maximizing of the screens now goes wrong, when clicked the
window spreads over both monitors.
Setting Maxmize 50 100 is not an option, because then
the maximized windows will always move to the first monitor.

Regards,
Marc Dirix

This msg does not concern fvwm but the Xft library.

I recently installed 2.4.15.  I'm curious to see the latest unstable release
2.5.x. Can both be installed simulataneously without harm?  How?

Say, I have several fvwm source dirs (all from cvs branches) and several
fvwm installations. The current 2.5.x cvs tree is configured as:

  ./configure --prefix /opt/fvwm

2.4.x tree:

  ./configure --prefix /opt/fvwm-2.4

2.2.x tree:

  ./configure --prefix /opt/fvwm-2.2

The executable to run is /opt/fvwm/bin/fvwm and so on.

Mikhael.

With 2.5.6, you can shade a window in any direction.  Add a button
to the left and right of the bar to shade it towards the given
direction:

  *BarButtons: (+0+0, Action Next (BarButtons, CirculateHit) WindowShade west)
  *BarButtons: (-0+0, Action Next (BarButtons, CirculateHit) WindowShade east)

To unshade it, bind something to the window frame, e.g.

  Mouse 1 SF S WindowShade off

(shift-button 1 to unshade).

Hi all,

   I cvs up today , but my configuration of fvwm seems not work for me. The error code is:
   [FVWM][FlocaleGetFontSet]: WARNING -- can't load font 'shadow =1 center:xft:arial:pixelsize=8:style=bold' trying default .....

   My configuration is:
   Style *log Sticky, TitleAtRight,NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4,\
        BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 1, ClickToFocus,\
        Font "shadow=1 center :xft:arial:pixelsize=8:style=bold",\
        TitleAtRight, RightTitleRotatedCW, WindowListSkip, UseDecor Flat
    
    It works well before I cvs up. The ChangeLog says:

    "
        2003-05-18  olicha  <olivier.chapuis@free.fr>

	* fvwm/conditional.c (CMD_On):
	Added x,r,w,f and i file condition to the On command

	* fvwm/add_window.c (destroy_window):
	Fixed a memory leak (a FvwmWindow !) when a window is not destroyed
	but sheduled for destroy. Not sure that the fix is good.

	* fvwm/functions.c (__execute_function):
	* libs/defaults.h:
	Limited the depth of function to MAX_FUNCTION_DEPTH (=512).
	This fixes some cores dumps with "recursives" functions

	* fvwm/borders.c (border_create_root_transparent_pixmap):
	(border_draw_decor_to_pixmap):
	Fixed a core dump with a root transparent rotated title
	Fixed X errors 56 with RootTransparent titlebar and no E pixmap

	* libs/FGettext.c (fgettext_add_one_path): 
	(FGettextInit):
	(FGettextSetLocalePath):
	Fixed memory leak and chainning


    "
    Can anybody tells me why?

    Thanks a lot!

This space is not supported (and was never supported).

                     ^^

No space so there is something that I do not understand. It seems to
me that it is not possible that this line generate the warning above.
Indeed, this line works fine here.

So, I am a bit lost with your bug report. Can you check for font
def which beginning with "shadow =1" in your config file and fix it.
Then, can you check again?

As you recompile fvwm, maybe you lost xft support. What about
fvwm-config -s

Do you know netpbm ?

I pipe my Dumpscreen trough netpbm: 

*ButtonBar: (Frame 1, Title "xwd", Icon 32x32.xwd.xpm, Action \
        "Exec exec xwd |xwdtopnm |pnmtojpeg --quality 100 \
        >~/.fvwm/dumps/`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.jpg")

It works fine for me and I have the dumps timestamed. 

Thanks for the suggestions but I have a question: 

key Print Exec /bin/sh...

I was thinking, 'Key' has three values and the Action...
Is this right ???

After exiting the xsession, deleting the .xsession-errors I get the Error: 

[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset 'fixed', trying

JPEG image, color space YCbCr, 3 comps, Huffman coding.
  Merging...done
  Building XImage...done

Now I have added two 'A' for context 'ALL' and modifier 'ALL' and now
it works...

Question:   I can not open the Menus and press 'Print'. - WHY ???
            Ther is no reaction. (the nenus are not closed)

Many Thanks
Michelle

It was a typo, Dan really meant:

  Key Print A A Exec /bin/sh...

Because when the menu is open no normal activity is done, global mouse
and keyboard bindings do not work (except for those handled by menus),
module commands are not processed and so on. But system works of course.
This is why you should bind it like:

  Key s A CM Exec sleep 15; import -window root /tmp/screenshot.png

Then you have 15 seconds after pressing Ctrl-Alt-S to open any submenus
you like.

Mikhael.

Hi,

  Sorry for wrong typing "shadow =1..." :(  It is "shadow=1..."
  I am using gentoo linux, the X version is 4.3.0, fontconfig version is 2.2.0.
  The configure output tells me:
  "
 With Asian bi-direct. text support? yes
  With Gettext Native Lang Support?   yes (libc)
  With GTK+ required for FvwmGtk?     yes
  With GDK image support in FvwmGtk?  yes

  With PNG image support?             yes
  With ReadLine sup. in FvwmConsole?  yes
  With RPlay support in FvwmEvent?    no: Can't find working librplay

  "
  Indeed, I have Xft in /usr/X11R6/lib (libXft.so.2 ...), even I use 
  ./configure --with-xft-prefix=/usr/X11R6/lib --with-exec-xft-prefix=/usr/X11R6
  , I can not enable xft :(

Hi,

some time ago I set up keyboard shortcuts for switching desktops with the 
cursor keys. For example the left key calls the function

AddToFunc GotoDeskLeft
+ I . GotoDesk %{ ($[desk.n]%$f::hdesks >= 1) ? -1 : 0; }%

This function checks if the current desktop is in a certain range and calls 
GotoDesk accordingly. The problem however is that when I hit the left key 
very fast a couple of times, GotoDesk isn't finished between successive 
calls to GotoDeskLeft. Therefore $[desk.n] might not be up to date in 
certain calls to GotoDeskLeft and I end up on a desktop out of range.

Any ideas how to solve that problem?

Felix

So by simply pointing at the version to be executed, it will find any

The ModulePath gets built into the executable.
So it knows where to find modules.

There are a few pieces of Fvwm that are obtained thru your PATH
like FvwmCommand.

I often run multiple versions of Fvwm, I use a shell to pick
the right version, and the SHELL puts the version of Fvwm being
used at the front of the PATH.

I start fvwm through a VNC xstartup file containing the single line
"../bin/fvwm2&"

How would I use your idea in this scenario?

The only fvwm2 I have in my initial path is a shell script called fvwm2.

It looks like this:

export FVWMHOME=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.4.0
export FVWMHOME=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.2.5
export FVWMHOME=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.4.13
export FVWMHOME=/opt/public/src/fvwm/2.5.7
export PATH=$PATH:$FVWMHOME
exec $FVWMHOME/fvwm2 "$@"

Please always specify which version do you run.
Please always provide enough of the configuration to be understandable,
one may only guess how exactly you defined the "." function.

Anyway, I think that you use 2.5.6 instead of a later snapshot, this is
why it does not synchronized for you. Works for me.

Another solution (not sure why you don't use it anyway) is to use
GotoDesk with the first zero parameter:

  . %{ $[desk.n] > 0 ? "" : "#" }% GotoDesk 0 %{ $[desk.n] - 1 }%

Then you don't need any synchronization between fvwm and FvwmPerl and it
may work in 2.5.6 too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry, I forgot to mention:
1. I'm using 2.5.6.
2. AddToFunc .
   + I SendToModule FvwmPerl eval preprocess({ 'command' => 1 } , q~$*~)

Interesting. I'll check out a later version when a new snapshot is 
available.

Hm, I don't see much of a difference to my solution. But the above code 
indeed seems to work better. Thank you.

BTW, now that you are back to the list, could you please take a look at my 
still unanswered questions in the thread "Getting Layer of current 
window?"?

Hi all,

I use fvwm2 since 1994 but only now I feel the need to use more than one 
desktop... ;-))

My problem is the following: in my current configuration (1 desktop) I
want a background which should be picked up randomly in a directory with
pictures. Moreover, it should change every hour. The only way I have been
able to obtain this is as follows:

my StartFunction contains the line

+ I Exec exec crontab /usr/local/etc/fvwm/cron.dir/hour

the hour file contains

------
SHELL=/bin/bash
DISPLAY=:0.0
PATH=/usr/local/etc/fvwm/bin

0 * * * * cgbg
-------------

cgbg is a script which simply calls


#!/bin/sh
/usr/X11R6/bin/xv -rb black -maxpect -rmode 5  
	-random /usr/local/etc/fvwm/bgs/* -quit


(I put it in a separate script so that it can also be called directly, 
somewhere else)

I don't know if this is the best way to have the job done but, so far, it 
worked, so I didn't feel the need for another solution (but for being 
forced to install manually xv, which is no longer included in any 
distribution... :-(

Now I use 2 desktops. I realized that my scripts have the effect to put 
the same image in the two desktop. What I want now is: on the first 
desktop (=0), same behavior as before. On the second desktop (=1), I 
would like to have a solid color background, which shouldn't change. I 
made some tries with FvwmBacker, but without success, so I am out of 
ideas: can anybody help me?

Thank you in advance 

Fabio

It's shareware. RH can't distribute it.
But it is also my preferred viewer.
I sent some $$s to the author.

Have the script simply choose a backdrop but not set it with xv.
Use FvwmEvent to set the backdrop on entry to each desktop appropriately,
using xv.

I have FvwmEvent run a script called enterdesk when I switch desks:

	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/scripts/enterdesk

Pickim and rootbg et al are ludicrously overengineered scripts to do
something like what you want, but the enterdesk stuff may well be readily
modified to suit you.

Try the following instead in 2.5.x:

  AddToFunc ChangeRootHourly
  + I Exec exec cgbg
  + I Schedule 3600000 ChangeRootHourly

  AddToFunction StartFunction
  + I ChangeRootHourly

You don't need to use xv, there is "display" from ImageMagick that
understand all image formats, there is fvwm-root from 2.5.x that
understands XPM and PNG and there are some other root setters.

You may run FvwmBacker that uses 2 Pixmap colorsets, one per desk.
Then the setup for 2.5.x may look like this (untested):

  DestroyFunc ChangeRootHourly
  AddToFunc   ChangeRootHourly
  + I PipeRead `dump-2-config-lines-for-colorset-51-and-52`
  + I Schedule 3600000 ChangeRootHourly

  AddToFunction StartFunction
  + I ChangeRootHourly
  + I FvwmBacker

  *FvwmBacker: Command (Desk 0) Colorset 51
  *FvwmBacker: Command (Desk 1) Colorset 52

The script should dump 2 lines, something like:

  Colorset 51 Pixmap bg7.png
  Colorset 52 Pixmap bg4.png

Mikhael.

Any May snapshot should be good. Please redefine your "." function
to use "SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*" if you upgrade.

"Go to desk number 1" does not need synchronization in that you may send
2 such commands and you will always be in range. "Go to +1 desk" requires
synchronization, because if you send 2 such commands before the first is
finished you may be out of range.

I can reproduce this bug, but have no time to debug it.

If I am not wrong, what you suggest is something which changes the 
background every time I switch the desktop, isn't it?
If so, it is not exactly what I mean.

I also ad a look at your scripts: they are very well done, but somewhat 
too involved and with too many interdependencies to be easily modified.

What I was simply looking for, was a (simple, if possible) way to tell 
fvwm:

for desktop 0 use this (function to select a) background
for desktop 1 use this  background


The solution suggested by Mikhael seems much closer to what I wanted: I 
will try it.

Thank you anyway

Fabio

I'm trying to create a function that warps the pointer to the
currently running browser (which could be Phoenix, Galeon, or
Mozilla), and if none of those browsers is running, starts up the
browser of my choice.  Here's what I have:

DestroyFunc Warp-or-Run-Browser
AddToFunc Warp-or-Run-Browser
+ "I" Next ("*Phoenix") Warp-and-Raise
+ "I" Cond (Match) Break
+ "I" Next ("Galeon") Warp-and-Raise
+ "I" Cond (Match) Break
+ "I" Next ("Mozilla") Warp-and-Raise
+ "I" Cond (Match) Break
+ "I" Exec /home/tlau/bin/browser

If I invoke the function when no browsers are running, it correctly
starts up a new browser.

If I invoke this function when Mozilla is running, however, the pointer
warps to the running Mozilla, and also starts up a second instance of
my browser.

What am I doing wrong?

Run a more current fvwm version where Break is not broken (quirk).

I think I already asked today on the list to always specify your version.

Oops, I forgot to specify the version.  You're right, upgrading from
2.5.5 to 2.5.6 seems to fix it.  Thanks.

Are you sure that "Mozilla" match the name, icon name, class or resource
of your running Mozilla (try FvwmIdent)?
I need Mozilla* (or Mozilla-bin) for matching my Mozilla.

I tried: your suggestion works fine. Only two point:

1) am I forced to use png? I have lots of jpgs, so I should convert them.
Ok, it is simple and quick, but it is somewhat a waste of space to have
two copies of hundreds of pictures... 

2) Your suggestion has the effect that the background gets changed every
hour _since_ I fire up fvwm: what if I want the effect only exactly at the
hour (3:00, 4:00, 5:00, and so on...)?

Thank you 

Fabio

Hi,

I'm using fvwm 2.5.6 (with support for: XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, NLS)
and fvwm-themes 0.6.2 on Solaris 5.8.

I'm still playing around with the themes (really impressive I have to say),
but occasionally when I browsed in the root menu, fvwm stalled.  I found out
now that this happened when I moved the mouse pointer over the last 2 entries
in "Root Menu->System" i.e. over "Root dir" or "Home dir". The mouse pointer
changes to the little watch and fvwm stalls. I have to kill my whole session
from another workstation.

As a workaround I copied the file menus-programs to
 ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/menus-programs-extra and commented out the 2 lines
i.e. the last 4 lines:

#+ ""  Nop
#+ MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
#+ "Root dir%menu/folder.xpm%"      Popup /
#+ "Home dir%menu/home.xpm%"        Popup ~


Now without these 2 entries it works, but I wonder what's causing it.

Thanks

Klaus

BTW, you timing problem with Mikhael's suggestion is easily addressed.
As before, use your cron job to pick a fresh backdrop on the hour.
And copy the selected image to a generic name like ~/.current-backdrop.jpg,
and always have fvwm load that name.

fvwm-root is quite quick. If you take the effort you can size the source
image to fit your screen and convert to PNG on the way, and store the
converted image as your generic name. The update is very quick after that.

You may instead kill fvwm-menu-directory process although I never saw it
may stall in many years, I don't see anything that may stall in it.

Can you run "fvwm-menu-directory --dir /" from the shell? Does it stall?

If this is continued to be a problem for you, the correct way to fix it
is to create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/functions-appbind-extra file
(see FAQ to read how to activate it) that looks like:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  + I AddToMenu "$0" "%menu/information.xpm%Disabled directory menu" Title

I would also like FVWM to support JPG together with PNG, XPM and XBM,
but I am afraid this is not going to happen until at least 2.7.x.

Well, then you should do some time mathematics.
Replace the "Schedule 3600000 ChangeRootHourly" line above with:

  PipeRead `perl -MTime::Local -e '@t = localtime; $t[0] = $t[1] = 0; $t[2]++; printf "Schedule %s ChangeRootHourly\\n", ((timelocal @t) - time) * 1000'`

I'm sorry, Michelle, but I don't understand your question.

I use the following command

  AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmButtons BarButtons

to display the buttons described by the BarButtons config statements.  What
is the "ButtonPanel" config you are asking for?

I would like to use bubblemon but the colors don't work correctly.  I've
tried this using both fvwm and cde under both VNC and Exceed so I am pretty
sure it's not a WM or X Server problem.  SO what _is_ the problem?  Is anyone
using it successfully on Solaris 7?  Any ideas what could be wrong?

Hello,

I cannot seem to figure this out so here is my plaintive cry for help:

How do I get fvwm to support bitmaps with a depth of 24? Every time that I
minimize an application w/such an icon(such as mozilla), fvwm spits out
the following error:

[FVWM][GetIconBitmap]: <<ERROR>> Window '<some window>' has a bad icon
bitmap depth 24(should be 1 or 8)! Ignoring icon bitmap.

I've also tried experimenting w/the -I option setting the visual-id but
that appears not to have made a difference...

It appears that in a brief, inexperienced perusal of the source code that
this value is determined by something in XWMHints... I can't seem to find
any information other than a man page on XWMHints.

Any help would be appreciated.

Some pertinent information:

Well, I would have never been able to produce such a thing! And, what is 
worse, it works!!!

Thank you a lot.

BTW: just for understanding it better: all suggestions, both yours and 
Cameron's, work changing the background every time the desktop is 
changed, even if the desktop itself didn't change. I tried, for example,

Colorset 1 Pixmap $[HOME]/a.png
Colorset 2 Pixmap $[HOME]/b.png
*FvwmBacker: Command (Desk 0) Colorset 1
*FvwmBacker: Command (Desk 1) Colorset 2

without any other "esotheric" function. It seems to me that it should be
the more simple and correct way to have two different (but fixed!)  
backgrounds on different desktops. Yet when I switch desk, the bg get
redrawn every time, and it takes a little time. Not a lot, just half a
second or so, but anyway longer than I expected. 
If it is so, it seems to me that there is somewhat a waste of resources.
Or is it not?

Regards

Fabio

Not really.  Most X servers have only one physical display page,
so you have to redraw (at least the exposed parts of) that page
to change the background.

Take a look at config.log after ./configure ...  and search for
fontconfig-config in this file.  This may help you/me to detect the
problem.  Do you have fontconfig-config somewhere (in path)?  Do you
have the appropriate devel packages? It is possible that
fontconfig+Xft1+Xft2 are packaged separately (i.e., not with
XFree). Sorry, but I know nothing about gentoo linux.

Yes JPG will be good, but surely after 2.6. Also, one thing about
images and fvwm I would like to implement after 2.6 is a good image
resizing algo.

Based on my experience, the one in xli is the fastest.

Its still a serious amount of computation, every pixel has to
be compared to all the surrounding pixels.

Actually when I posted I knew it has a small problem, once a day it stops
to work (printing: Hour '24' out of range 0..23). I only wanted to give
you an idea, here is a quick hack if you may tolerate one case:

  $t[2]++; $s = $t[2] == 24? 3600000: ((timelocal @t) - time) * 1000; \
  print "Schedule $s ChangeRootHourly\\n";`

Hmm, I see you use the "desktop" word for 2 different meanings. Which?
I suppose you simply mean it takes some time to see a new image.

Yes, it takes some time to copy a picture to the root window.
I don't think colorsets in FvwmBacker work much slower than xv.
Try also solid colors or simple tiles as your background to speed it.

It is. But I don't know whether there is a good solution in X for this.

Hi,

I defined a mouse stroke with these definitions:

Stroke N456 0 A N Maximize 100 100
Mouse 3 A N StrokeFunc DrawMotion

And I can draw mouse button 3 right in any window and
maximize that window.

But the problem comes that, my button 1 doesn't work after
that!

How could this happen? I think a stroke definition on
button3 shouldn't affect the function of button 1.

My fvwm version is 2.5.6.

Bubblemon is the wrong color on my Solaris box(en) too.  Instead of blue sky and 
water, the background is red.  It looks more like a bloody duck-hunting scene 
than an idyllic pond.  I took a quick look at the code and I think it's directly 
fiddling the bits of the color specification, so I suspect it assumes 
little-endian x86 byte order and doesn't do the right thing on the big-endian 
sparc. See <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/b/big_endian.html> I'd probably learn 
something if I tried to fix it, but don't see when I'll ever get time.

no, killing fvwm-menu-directory doesn't help.
But ps shows that the call to fvwm-menu-directory contains more parameters
than just '-d "/"'.

kzeitler 10861   794  0 14:53:40 pts/3    0:00 sh -c fvwm-menu-directory -d "/" --exec-file ^emacs --check-subdir --links --wm

seems to be from functions-appbind in default theme:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ I PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" --exec-file ^emacs --check-subdir --links --wm-icons'

I can run the whole command (with and without the additional options) just
fine in a shell.


What amazes me is that fvwm stalls when I simply move the mouse over one of
the 2 menu entries "Root dir" or "Home dir", i.e. I don't click any of these
two entries. I'd expect fvwm to run the fvwm-menu-directory command as soon
as I select, i.e. click one of these entries.

Thanks,

Klaus

Groan, that's guaranteed not to work on many systems.  X makes no
guarantees at all about the meaning of the individual bits.  I may
work by accident on true colour visuals, but is almost doomed to
fail on every display with less than 24 bitplanes.

You can do little about it.  The application is specifying an icon
with 24 bitplanes, but your display has only 8 bitplanes.  Fvwm
copies the pixmap into the window's icon window which of course
uses only 8 bitplanes.

This all is strange. Please create a minimal config ~/.fvwm/minimal that
looks like:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  + I PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0"'

  AddToMenu MenuFvwmRoot
  + MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  + "Root directory" Popup /

Then do "Restart fvwm -f minimal" from FvwmConsole.
The default root menu should contain the last submenu.
Does it stall for you when you enter it?

If it does not stall (I think it will on your system), add this command
using FvwmConsole that is in the root menu, and enter this submenu again:

  BusyCursor DynamicMenu True, Read True

In case it does not stall (unlikely), type this into FvwmConsole:

  Restart fvwm-themes-start

All popup submenus work on enter + optional delay, not on click, there
are some MenuStyle options to control this, try menustyle@brushedmetal.
I don't see anything to be amazed of, these 2 menus behave exactly like
other popup submenus except that they are dynamically built every time.
For example there are 2 Menu entries (not Popup) in the same System menu
labeled Browser. They are separate menus not submenus, i.e. work on click.
I hope they actually work ok for you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

The big change in this release is that it finally supports key-bindings.
(eg. you can switch b/w tabs with your keyboard.) There are other
small improvements too - see the web page.

SCoTT. :)

here's more info:

I added "Module FvwmCommand" to my startup and tried:
FvwmCommand FuncFvwmMenuDirectory "/"
Same result, fvwm stalled, but now I could still use this one xterm that
had the focus. The session error file (~/.dt/sessionlogs/sfsw51_DISPLAY=:0)
now said "Option exec-file requires an argument". Somehow it seems as if
that "^emacs" in:
+ I PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" --exec-file "^emacs" --check-subdir
vanishes into thin air.
So now I created an functions-appbind-extra with
--- snip ---
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ I PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" --exec-file "^emacs" --check-subdir --links --wm-icons'
--- snip ---
i.e. with a quoted "^emacs" and it works!


If that error log wouldn't be overwritten when I start a new session, I'd
have found this a lot easier. I think I'm going to save that at the end of my
xsession file now.

Still I have a few questions:

1. what's happening with that "^file" expression?
2. why/how is determined that emacs is used for text files? This is certainly
   not a problem for me, cause that's the only editor I've been using since
   1985, but we have other users here that despise emacs. Isn't it possible to
   use the env variable EDITOR or some such here?

Thanks

Klaus

You may take a look at "man sh" on your system. I will quote it.

I would really like to use $EDITOR, but this variable is a bit useless in
X Window in that some of the editors open their own windows (weird) and
some work in the terminal as designed by $EDITOR. So to work for all
$EDITOR values you should always open xterm even for emacs. The caret
says not to open an xterm.

So the only way to customize this is to redefine FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
in functions-appbind-extra, you may redefine your own viewer, browser,
prefered image processors and so on in the same file too (see FAQ).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi there,

I switched to "FvwmWinList Transient" from FvwmTaskBar. I
realized that the command:

Module FvwmWinList Transient

produces a couple of beeps (3 or more) which I find very
disturbing.
Any hints how to switch this off?

The command "Module FvwmWinList" does not produce this beep
but it remains the list after clicking.

(fvwm 2.5.6, Sun Solaris)

I don't like to switch off the X-beep using "xset b 0" or
something similar.

Thanks in advance.

Regards, Uwe

The beeps indicate that something bad has happened.  As
FvwmWinList does not produce beeps itself they must come from
somwhere inside fvwm.  This probably indicates a bug.

I know I am asking for much, but could you systematically disable
all XBell() calls in the fvwm/ directory to see which ones cause
the beeps?

Bye

I am quite busy at the moment. If I am the only one who has
this problem it might be on my side. 

I change the configuration a bit and see what's happen ...

After commenting out the following lines the beep is gone:

# *FvwmWinListButtonFrameWidth 2
# *FvwmWinListLeftJustify

Hope this helps ;-)

Only if you post the rest of your FvwmWinList config too.

Thanks for getting back to me. It appears that I am out of luck... or am
I? If I understand what you are saying, the icon window is limited to a
depth of 8. Is this a limitation of the video card/monitor or fvwm
itself? Replacing the monitor/video card is not horribly difficult...

Thanks,

Hi all,

As stated in the subject. Despite "intensive" searches I can't find
something and started wondering: what if it isn't possible? :)

Dorothy,

Well I'm glad that it's not just me and that it must be something systemic.

I also took a look at th code and I think I have to disagree about your
analysis - unless I'm looking at the wrong thing.

I'm assuming that you are referring to the following code:

    r_air_noswap = (bm.air_noswap >> 16) & 0xff;
    g_air_noswap = (bm.air_noswap >> 8) & 0xff;
    b_air_noswap = (bm.air_noswap) & 0xff;

I added printf statements and and found that it does do the right thing.
Here is my output:

bm.air_noswap: 2299ff
r_air_noswap: 22
g_air_noswap: 99
b_air_noswap: ff

Assuming a color spec 0x2299ff, it does break up the RGB values correctly.

...Jake

Sorry, after reading the list that long I should have known

Here is all config stuff which is involved:

I tried also the new syntax like

with the same result.

Well, I've been using sawfish for a couple days now and I haven't seen
Evolution grab the focus.  Yet as soon as I switch back to FVWM 2.5.6, I
see it happen almost immediately.  The cursor rolls over the Evolution
window, and just after it leaves, Evolution loses focus, and then
Evolution grabs the focus back, even though the mouse cursor is outside
the Evolution window.

It happens with vmware too, but vmware does its own wacky cursor
grabbing thing so I'm not too surprised.

I've tried on multiple occasions to reproduce the problem without
success.

What focus settings do you have?

I use:

Style * MouseFocus

Which version of Evolution are you running?

I have 0.13.

Which hint types does your version of Fvwm support (Gnome/EMWH)?

Thanks for trying.  I know I'm not crazy, even though I may not be able
to prove it. :)

> What focus settings do you have?

I use:

	Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

However I've also reproduced the problem with the FocusFollowsMouse
style and an otherwise default config.

> Which version of Evolution are you running?

I have Ximian Evolution 1.2.4.

No, that does not show any problem for me.  How exactly do you
invoke the window list?  Via FvwmConsole, a key or a mouse button?
Does it make any difference if you choose another method?

Forget what I said earlier., I did not look carefully at what you
wrote:

So, xdpyinfo claims the display has 24 bit planes but unly 8
bitplanes can be used to specify colours?  That is strange indeed.
Fvwm uses the display's default depth, which is 8 on your system.
Yet, your X server tells the applications that they can use 24
bits.  I have no idea what this could mean.  It may be a bug in
the X server.

Then you either have to get used to it or don't uns sticky windows
with titels :-)  There are vague plans for 3.0 to add this.

There is a part of the output that shows the depth of the root
window.  What is it set to?

Maybe you should just post the whole thing.

Hi, I have a problem about gThumb under fvwm. I wonder if I should
post this question here, but I don't where should be. So, if I made
a wrong decision I appologize first.

Recently I began to use your FVWM wm. In the past, I was using gnome,
but it is too slow I can't bear it at all. However, when I use gThumb,
a very good photoviewer under gnome, a problem occured. If I make
gThumb full screen display, it will not really full screen display,
on the other hand, it become a very small (as the picture in attachment).

Can you help with this problem?

Thanks.

Hmm. No, this is saying he has a 24 bit display where each colour component
is 8 bits deep. Which is normal.

Ah, I see.  Still, the error message Sean got claims that the root
window has only 8 bitplanes:

  [FVWM][GetIconBitmap]: <<ERROR>> Window '<some window>' has a bad icon
  bitmap depth 24(should be 1 or 8)! Ignoring icon bitmap. 
                                ^^^

This number was returned by

  DefaultDepth(dpy,Scr.screen)

The DefaultDepth macro returns the depth of the root window of a
specific screen.

In any case, I think that

 a) It's a bug in the application(s),
 
and

 b) Posting the full output of xdpyinfo might help to resolve the
    problem.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I don't see a problem with the newest fvwm code (the upcoming
2.5.7 release) and gthumb-0.9.8.  Perhaps you should ask the
gthumb developers.

Dear List,

It has been a while since I last e-mailed this list. I am thankful to say
that I have been enjoying playing with fvwm-themes -- that suite of themes
is amazing :) well done.

My question is this. I have a sticky window, which when I move pages is
visible. Ideally what I would like to happen is to define different
location geometries for that window when I change the focus from one page
to another. Is this possible?

Many thanks,

-- Thomas Adam

Sticky window always has sticky geometry, try to change a viewport in the
pager using mouse button 3, how would this work with your suggestion?

But I see 2 possible solutions, all have their own problems.

1) Setup FvwmEvent that listens to new_page and moves your sticky window
to one or another location depending on $[page.nx] and $[page.ny].
(It is probably shorter to write a perl-based module that does this,
reask if you want to know how.)

2) Run several applications, one per page and optionally make them
StickyAcrossDesks (in 2.5.x). Then you should only initially place these
windows correctly on different pages with different geometries, probably
StartsOnPage may help here.

If you need additional help, provide additional info (your version,
with or without fvwm-themes).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Newer versions of gentoo linux don't install a fontconfig-config script.
Insead they expect you to use something like `pkg-config fontconfig --libs`
The way gentoo implements the xft stuff is pretty wacked. I forget
exactly what i did here to fix it, but, I belive all I did was make a
wrapper script for fontconfig-config.

sa@m ~ % cat /usr/bin/fontconfig-config
#!/bin/bash
pkg-config fontconfig $*

You might have to edit /usr/lib/pkgconfig/fontconfig.pc and or
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/xft.pc to fix some things too.

(sorry for the late reply)
I asked to the rox mailing list. They say that the problem is probably due to 
the fact that Fvwm closes stdin in the Exec and later rox tries to divert it
to /dev/null. They suggest that Fvwm should do something similar instead of 
closing stdin directly.

Can you test what I just checked into CVS and let me know if it helps?

Hi there,

Okay, here we go:

Mouse   2       R       A       Module  FvwmWinList -transient
Mouse   2       A       4       Module  FvwmWinList -transient

But I had some tries this morning which showed a
non-determinisitic behaviour of this problem:

First I used mouse button 2 and the beeps occured. Then I
used FvwmConsole to start this command and the beep did not
occur. Using button 2 afterwards did not cause a beep.

So maybe we stop here. I found a workaround and the problem
does not seem that serious.

Fvwm fully supports _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN.  I assume it does
not work with gThumb because it sets _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
after its window is already mapped.

Besides, it is pretty broken to blindly assume the window manager
supports this feature because (a) according to the EWMH spec this
hint is fully optional and (b) the window manager may not
implement the EWMH spec at all.

Perhaps you can forward this mail to the gThump developers.

I think I've the solution of the problem (I read all the others mail
of this thread).

Sean has a 8/24 depth screen and the X server start with DefaultDepth = 8.
This is a classical situation (the X server can be configured to start
with DefaultDepth = 24, but as certain "old" apps need depth 8 for read-
write colours the default is depth 8; moreover on such hardware there is
no visual pbs by using certain app under depth 8 and other with depth 24).

BTW, since 2.5.6 fvwm detect this situation and fvwm choose to use the
best visual: TrueColor depth 24 (before 2.5.6 the user had to use
the --visual-id or --visual option; now fvwm need _no_ option).
A lot of apps use this logic too.

So, for applications supplied icon pixmap we have 3 acceptable depth:

- depth 1 (always ok)
- depth 8, the default depth
- depth 24, the fvwm depth

I've just committed a fix.

Sean can you try the next fvwm snapshot?

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-20030526.tar.gz

should contains the fix and will pop-up soon (tomorrow).

Cool.  Can you backport the fix to 2.4.16 too?  It looks fairly
simple, but I'm not sure I would catch all places I have to touch
to make the patch myself.

Ooops, In fact fvwm (2.5.x branch) does not support
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN, I do not see how to implement this without a
new command or a new option to Maximize "fullscreen" which will remove
the decoration, maximize and possibly put the window into layer +2
(and keep in memory what is needed to restore the window). I've planed
to do this so fvwm claim to support _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN this is a
bug. Two possible fixes: add this fullscreen option to Maximize or
remove _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN from the list of the supported EWMH
stuff.

Ok. But I do not think I should also backport the autodetection of
the best visual on such hardware. What do you think?

It is not a problem of cyclic links somehow?

No, I'd only backport the bug fixes.

There is no digging in more than depth 1 per menu, so the answer is no.

The problem is in unquoted "^" as Klaus said in another message.
Just tried on Solaris, this command tries to launch emacs, uff.
This is equivalent to "PipeRead emacs", fvwm will stall as expected.

Mikhael.

Fvwm version: 2.4.5 

Let's say I have three windows with resource names win1, win2, win3.
I want to set things up so that when any of the three windows are
raised, the other two are also raised automatically.  Similarly,
when any one of them is lowered, the other two are also lowered
automatically.  In other words, the three windows act in tandem as
far as raising/lowering goes.

Let's assume that the geometry of the windows are fixed and they
do now overlap, otherwise we may run into problems.

I played around with FvwmEvent but did not get far.  I would appreciate
if you could help me with this.

In case you are wondering why I want to do this, here is the reason.
I have three little windows near the bottom edge of the screen.
A Pager, an Xosview, and an Xload.  Like this:


     +------------+     +------------+     +------------+
     |            |     |            |     |            |
     |            |     |            |     |            |
     +------------+     +------------+     +------------+

If these windows are partially obscured by another application and
if the user raises one of them, I want all three to raise at once,
giving the impression that they are one whole unit, not three separate
windows.

PS:  I tried putting the three objects inside one FvwmButtons, but wasn't
able to make transparent horizontal gaps between them.

You should be aware of endless loops. Say, you listen to lower_window,
get win1 then you lower all 3 windows and get 3 new lower_window
events... Maybe "*FvwmEvent: Delay 2" will help you to avoid this.

Is the problem that your windows are CirculateSkip? Then do:

  Next (FvwmPager, CirculateHit) Lower

This is indead the best solution. Can you try again with 2.5.x using
transparent colorset and "Style FvwmButtons ParentalRelativity"?

Hi,

I'm trying to compose my personal theme with bits and pieces from some
of the themes (mainly default + olicha). 

Versions info: fvwm 2.5.6 (with support for: XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, NLS)
               fvwm-themes 0.6.2 on Solaris 5.8.


Hope somebody can help me with a few minor details:

1. Can I remove the left button and the right window that shows the time on
   the TaskBar?

2. I'd like to have a border around FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets>. I thought
   I can change this with the following line in styles-extra:
   Style "FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets" BorderWidth 2
   but this doesn't help

3. is there a tool/module that I can use to see all the Colorsets of a theme

4. when I open the Pager-Desker panel (theme olicha), hide the panel
   behind another window, and then bring it back to the foreground,
   the border corners, that were hidden, look gaudy (sometimes a
   different color, sometimes some weird pixels)

Thanks

Klaus

I would be inclined to create a directory in $HOME/.fvwm

Into that directory cp the appropriate files from both themes.

Yes, <CTRL><SHIFT><F9> will give you the appropriate colour palette.

Use FvwmEvent for this.

I think you didn't understand the original question.

This only gives meaningful results in 2 themes that use color palletes.

Kind of. Go to "Themes -> Current -> modules" and choose one of the
supplied WinList or IconMan options instead of TaskBar. A side effect of
this will be that the window list will grow up. If you want it to behave
exactly like FvwmTaskBar, but without its left and right parts, ask the
theme author (or me) to add this options to modules@olicha.

You should do this in modules-extra, not styles-extra, because
styles-extra is read before modules.

> 3. is there a tool/module that I can use to see all the Colorsets of a theme

Type in FvwmConsole (Alt-F12) the following:

  FvwmScript FvwmScript-Colorset

But this tool is not perfect. It seems to be buggy, the colorset
background image flashes for me and then is replaced with a solid bg.

Can you suply a screenshot showing the problem?

BTW, there is a fvwm-themes-users mailing list for the questions.

Thanks you, Mikhael, for your useful suggestions regarding my recent
query (shown below.)  I figured out how to do transparent FvwmButtons
in version 2.4.5.  I will upgrade to 2.5.* one of these days to use
the newer features.

Now I have a related question.  When I change the root window
background image, the transparent FvwmButtons do not refresh
themselves, because I guess they are not aware that the root has
changed.  I have to do a RefreshWindow on FvwmButtons to get the
transparent parts adapt to the new background.  This brings me to my
question: will upgrading to 2.5.* help to get around this?  If not,
is there a "standard" method to update fvwm's transparent objects
when the root background changes?

As always, thank you for your time and dedication to readers of this
mailing list.

In 2.5.*, if you use an appropriate "set root" program, fvwm detect
root bg change and update the Transparent colorsets.
See FvwmThemes (2.5.x) man page for details.

I had posted a message last week about problems with the color display on a
Solaris system.  At least two people responded with confirmations of the
problem and suggesting that it might be a big-endian/little-endian
problem.  This was a correct analysis of the problem but the code was
designed to deal with those differences.  The problem is with the compiler.

To fix the problem, replace the fancy

#if (defined(__BYTE_ORDER) && defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN) && (__BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN)) || defined(_LITTLE_ENDIAN) || (BYTE_ORDER == LITTLE_ENDIAN)

at appx line #911 with the simpler

#if 0

Apparently, the compiler being used does not support the __BYTE_ORDER and/or
__LITTLE_ENDIAN defined constants.  If you know you are on a big-endian
machine, simply force the compiler to read the appropriate code and you'll be
fine.

Please let me know if this works for you.

...Jake

You should really send this to the bubblemon developers, not the

With the future 2.5.7 (or current cvs) add in modules-extra:

*FvwmTaskBar: ClockFormat

Hum, I can reproduce this, but maybe I do not understand the procedure.
Can you give more details and/or a step by step procedure (my English
is a bit poor ...).

I did.  I originally posted a plea for help with the hope other users of fvwm
had seen this problem and knew how to fix it (since the developer could
not).  As a courtesy to those users I posted the fix here.

Just downloaded and installed 2.5.6.  Works just as advertised.
Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi,

unfortunatelly I can't find the answer in the man pages to the following
little question:

(1) Everything *is* ok when I e.g. change focus from one window to the
other by clicking the fvwmtaskbar. The new window appears at once.

(2) Focus also changes emediately (and window is drawn at once) when
clicking to a window which doesn't *overlap* another window.

(3) However in a very special case the focus change but the new window
is drawn with a certain delay of half a second. This is quite
irritating. So, to reproduce this case do the following:

- take two windows, let them overlap a bit
- click onto the *titlebar* (not into the body of the window!) of the
window in the background and
- just click, don't move the mouse!
In this case you'll notice the delay.

So, sorry for this long story. Does anybody know how to change this
behaviour?

Thank You
 Felix Kater

Felix,

I think what you are describing here is inherent in the way that fvwm is
setup (there is nothing wrong -- it is not a bug). The reason why it takes
that fraction of a second longer, is because clicking and holding mouse
button 1 invokes the "move" function that allows you to move the window.

If you want to have that window raised and focused (via sloppyfocus), then
ensure that the autoraise module is loaded.

HTH,

Hi Thomas,

I think things you descibe are a bit different from what I meant: I am
not talking about click *and hold* the mouse button.

If the delay was due to some processor time it's ok but it isn't: If you
click (just a short click) and don't move the mouse then you'll have the
delay. If you instead click (just like the first time) and move the
mouse *afterwards* the background window is brought to the front
emediately and without delay. I don't think that this is a really
essetial thing but it makes fvwm look slow in some cases which wouldn't
be necessary, it seems.

btw: I forgot to say that sloppy focus isn't of course what I am talking
about. The whole thing does of course only appear with ClickToFocus
policy.

Thanks
 Felix

If you have a function which handles single clicks and double
clicks differently, fvwm has to wait for a moment after releasing
the button to see if the single click becomes a double click:

  AddToFunc foo
  + C Raise
  + M Move
  + D WindowShade

--> delay

To get rid of the delay you can remove the double click action:

  AddToFunc bar
  + C Raise
  + M Move

or you can shorten the delay with the ClickTime command:

  Clicktime 30

lowers the allowed delay between the two clicks of a double click
to 30 milliseconds.  The defulat value is 150 milliseconds.

Bye

Is there a way to make it more obvious which page of the desktop is actually
active?  With my configuration, the background og the active page is white.
But on a busy page, there isn't enough background visible to make the white
area noticeable.

I can't reproduce this either with pre-2.4.16, but colors on the
screenshot do not seem to be among ones included with fvwm-themes, so
there is no enough info here. This may do something with X.

The empty space background is the only way currently to mark the current
page, so if some windows occupy all the screen, there is a problem.
At least the current desk is easier to recognize in a pager.

Maybe in the future a pager will have a better looking graphics with
possible 3d looking pages, but not now.

Key Tab    A   M    WindowList Root c c
Key Tab    A   M2    WindowList Root c c
...
Mouse 3	R    	A      	WindowList

In the screenshot, it looks like the bottom half is filled with bits of
a terminal window.  I would guess would be that either FvwmButtons isn't
redrawing for some reason (could be X server related), or the X server
is corrupting the pixmap cache/XAA offscreen drawing area (definitely X
server related.)  The top half looks like it was part of another window
as well, but it's nothing I recognize.

Did you install fvwm using "make install"? You should always do this.

If so you should have WindowListFunc defined in ConfigFvwmDefaults.

If for some reason you don't have this function defined or you
incorrectly redefined it, search the man page for "WindowListFunc".

Regards,
Mikhael.

   I installed the freeBSD port (so I did not do make install). 
Apparently the problem is missing ConfigFvwmDefaults, I saw fvwm 
complaining about it but since 'everything' works I didn't pay any 
attention to the warning:-)

   thank you,

A possible simplistic suggestion could be to mark the borders of the page
with a solid (and/or darker) line instead of the current dashed one.  That
in effect would make it rather obvious what's in focus.

I haven't looked at the code, but my guess is that the dashed lines are
drawn once and not worried about.  If that is the case, one could simply
superimpose a solid (or darker/thicker) line on the focused page borders
(if the user opted for it) at the expense of a couple of pixels from
neighboring pages (ie. their edges).

Just an idea,

 - Nadim

Ive changed mine x-pager.c to show a sliver of root along the bottom.

Real solution whould be to change color of active/inactive windows for
the active page....maybe lightening/darkening the colors.

fvmw-2.5.6

My .xmodmaprc has this in it:

    keycode 115 = Super_L
    keycode 116 = Super_R
    clear mod3
    clear mod4
    add mod3 = Super_L
    add mod4 = Super_R

and in my .fvwm2rc file I have this:

    AddToFunc InitFunction
    + I SetEnv QT_XFT 1
    + I exec xset s off b 50 64 50 r rate 250 32 m 5 10
    + I exec xsetroot -solid grey30
    + I exec gkrellm
    + I Exec xautolock -time 5 \
    	-locker "xlock -mode galaxy -nolock -erasedelay 0 -mousemotion"
    + I Exec xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc
    
    # omitted irrelevant stuff

    Key Super_L     A       A       Menu MenuFvwmRoot

I'm trying to configure fvwm so that my left windoze key will bring up
the main fvwm menu, regardless of the the context.  The only way it
works, though, is if I Restart fvwm.  If I just start fvwm it doesn't
work and my .xsession-errors file has this at the top:

    [FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: Super_L

Thanks in advance for any answers to this.

I am not sure what the code has to do so that it catches changes
in the keyboard layout.  Since 2.5.3, fvwm handles MappingNotify
events and calls XRefreshKeyboardMapping() to update its knowledge
of the keyboard, but your example shows that it does not fully
work.

To solve the problem, you should hard code the Xmodmap.  You can
generate a dump of the key map with xmodmap and put it in your
$HOME/.Xmodmap:

  $ xmodmap -pke > $HOME/.Xmodmap

You can then remove the xmodmap call from your start function.

Bye

Thanks to all the developers and beta testers who have made fvwm the
best window manager.  It's the one I used when I first started learning
and using Linux in 1997; it's the one to which I always return after
trying something else.  Keep up the excellent work.

hi!

I have 3x3 desktops. I move between them moving the mouse to the edge.
to get a window focused I need to click on it. I was wondering if it is
possible to configure my fvwm (2.4.15) so that the focus changes, when I
move to another desktop, to the window that last had the focus on this
desktop, so I don't have to click on it.

regards
hubert s.

This must be some kind of timing issue.  I generated the dump like you
said, but fvwm still behaved the same way.

Running xev (without running my original xmodmap script), I found out
that X thinks Key 115 is the Meta_L key.  I changed the Key command in
my .fvwm2rc file accordingly and now it works fine.  Thanks for your
help.

Dear All,

I have been singing fvwm's praises, ever since I encountered fvwm
indirectly via AnotherLevel six years ago. Fvwm has come a long way since
then. I am indebted to *all* of the people who invest their time and
effort into making it what it has become today.

THANK YOU, and keep up the excellent work. I have tried other WM's /
Desktops for Linux, but it is fvwm that is *the* best.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

Hey guys,
you asked for it, so I'll tell you.
I fist installed FreeBSD in 1997 and, I believe, I immediately installed
fvwm2 on it. Maybe played with fvwm95 a bit. We also had RedHat with fvwm
in school. I then briefly switched to KDE, played with Gnome, but soon
went back to fvwm2. I kept trying out KDE and Gnome periodically, but both
seems to be too slow and (surprisingly enough) neither of them had a usable
pager.
So today I have fvwm2 on my FreeBSD server/desktop, on my laptop
(FreeBSD/RedHat) and on my university account.
I even had one patch (minor bug fix) accepted which I'm a bit proud of :)

Here is my 4 year old screenshot:

Happy birthday and thanks!

I join the other happy users in conveying my congratulations
on the occasion of Fvmw's 10th birthday.

I recall very well the day when I asked a colleague to bring
his laptop over to show me this new thing called Linux.
It must have been around 1993 or so.  I believe he was running
fvwm as window manager.  The desktop contained the familiar
pager with each desktop split into 3x3 pages.  It looked very
similar to twm and mwm window managers which I had been using
at the time on Sun and Sgi machines.

The next day I instructed my sysadmin to download and install
Linux on my desktop.  That was before the days of fast internet
connections, CD burners, and commercial Linux distributions.
His download required a couple of days and took up about 30 floppies.
It must have been Linux kernel 0.96 or thereabouts.

The distribution (Slackware, I think) came with fvwm.  Converting
my twm config files to fvwm required very little effort.  The syntax
was almost the same.

I have used nothing but Linux and fvwm since then.  Shortly thereafter
we retired all our Sun and Sgi equipment and went completely Linux
in a department of about 30 faculty and 50 graduate students.  The
sysadmin maintained a firm control on configuring user accounts.
The only window manager made available was fvwm and it remains that
way to this day.  Generations of students have gone through the
department since, graduating with master's and doctoral degrees,
having done their entire graduate research, computation and
publishing through screens controlled by fvwm.  

I look forward to using fvwm for many years to come.

Happy birthday!

I don't know whether you are new to this list, but I asked unambiguously
to abstain from any political (even if half humorous) discussion on these
software lists.

You didn't like to express a sympaty to all victims, you didn't subscribe
the dedication. End of story.

Now, returning to the birthday mood.

Regards,
Mikhael.

hi,

i have got the following

Key Tab A M     WindowList Root c c NoGeometry,
CurrentAtEnd, SelectOnRelease Alt_L

in my fvwm cfg file, and works just the way i wish,
expect that when i have a desktop size of 3x3, *ALL*
windows from this desk are listed.

is there anyway (or plan means in future releases) to
allow the 'CurrentPage' option so that only windows on
the current page are listed?

thanks!

I configured a desert fvwm, and I had fun with *a lot* of options.
next I switched to window maker because I wanted a wm without
configuration problems etc.

Now I'm fallen in love again with fvwm and I want to use only fvwm :)

At the moment I'm building my aqua theme inspired by
http://frimouvy.udev.org/myconf/screen8.jpg!

thank you for your work and happy birthday!

ciao,
Marco

FVWM is Favorite Virtual Window Manager to me. :-)

I started using FVWM in late 1998 about the time I started using
Slackware Linux, my first Unix-like OS.  I stuck with FVWM for about
three years; partly due to my familiarity with it, and partly due to its
light-weightedness and flexibility.  I continued to use FVWM only
off-and-on for about a year.

Now, I am planning to return to using FVWM when time permits me to hack
on a personalized configuration.

Long live FVWM!

Thanks!!
I have been using using fvwm since I started using linux - I think it 
was the only wm out there besides twm.  anyway - i have since tried many 
others and have always returned to fvwm - its simple configuration,  
very powerful functionality and the vast number of ways i can make it 
look good all with a small memory foot print has me much more impressed 
today than I was when it first appeared on the scene.

In 1996 I installed my first Linux system, and ever since then I
have been using fvwm.  I compared it with dozens of other window
managers, but everything else seemed feeble.

Hell, without fvwm I wouldn't be able to visit the IRC chat this
evening:  my trackball is broken and I now depend solely on fvwm's
capability of being controlled with the keyboard only :-D

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FVWM!

Bye

Hey, the same with me! It came with my first SuSE X.Y, looked pretty
strange compared to what I had used before (Windows, OS/2) but was quite
usable already.

Additionally, the .fvwm2rc delivered with my distribution seemed to me
like a real programming language - which made it doubly interesting :)

Happy Birthday, Fvwm2! Thanks to all the developers who made and still
make it the most versatile window manager on earth!

Cheers!

I had my first serious "meeting" with UNIX workstations when I started
university back in 1995. Those where Suns (some of them where even Sparc
4's... :-) ).
They run OpenWindows (olwm). It was quite different from what I was used
to from home, Amiga.
Then in 1997 I changed to another department, they used Fvwm. Someone
showed me how to change some things like focus policy in .fvwmrc (this was
Fvwm 2.0.46, but compiled with binary name fvwm). Then I got hooked on
editing my .fvwmrc

Even if hadn't used mwm (motif), I viewed this for some reason as the way
UNIX should look... So I manipulated some, and got up with a configuration
that I liked.
This is what my configuration is still today, though I skipped the
button-bar and has made some scripts to setup colour schemes and such.

I think it was spring 1997 when  I  installed  Linux  on  my
computer.  FVWM2  was  set  as default window manager. Since
then I tried a couple of other wms but only for  at  most  a
couple  of  hours,  since  non  of  them had the robustness,
fastness, and the features FVWM has. 

For me, besides the best window manager, FVWM  is  a  living
open  source project which shows that good and free software
is possible. 

Thanks to all, who made FVWM the best window manger ever.

Happy Birthday, FVWM!

Have a good one.

Greetings,

Congratulations for ten years of successful development and may you
enjoy many more to come.

FVWM has been the window manager of my choice since I started using
Linux/GNU and I can see no reason for changing.

My philosophy of computing is a minimalist one, and FVWM allows
me to exercise this approach and avoid the extreme "bloat" that
exists within other packages such as GNOME or KDE or many others.

I am deeply grateful for the work of all those involved.

Larry Piet

Well...since this was solicited by the birthday web
page...

I've been using UNIX in its SunOS/Solaris incarnations
for at least a decade but only switched to Linux about
a year ago -- at that point, I began using fvwm after
recognizing that the window managing/desktop stuff
that came with redhat seemed to be a memory hog with
all sorts of extras I didn't need. 

Shortly after that, I went through an obsessive phase
of trying to determine "the best" window manager.
After trying about everything under the sun, I ended
up back with fvwm -- it seemed like every other window
manager either was lacking some sort of feature I
desired or simply lacked decent documentation...

Thanks for making the world a little better...

Alan

Is it only 10 years? feels like longer ;-)

I started using Unix in the days of proprietary-hardware CAD systems.  When the 
industry's software mostly started running on Sun equipment, and a little later 
Sun supported X11 with Openlook, a sysadmin turned me on to MWM as an 
alternative.  I think I started using FVWM in about 1994, and even then, like 
most TWM descendents I guess, it was pretty stable. I liked it because it was 
versatile, configurable down to the pixel, and had a single, reasonably sensible 
configuration file that I could play with to my geeky heart's content.  I used 
CTWM for awhile because for a time, you could do more with the titlebars, but I 
was running used Sun equipment at home and had performance problems.  So I went 
back to FVWM and found that not only was it immensely faster on my creaky 
SparcStation, but it had made strides in designability in the meantime.  Then, 
when the MultiPixmap style was added, almost all my wishes came true (many 
thanks to Suzanne.)

It's only in the last year that I finally switched to Linux at home.  But I 
still run FVWM on my Sun at work, as well as on my MacOSX machine on the rare 
occasions when I run a rooted X server on it (alas, the Fink distribution is 
still version 2.4.x)

Happy Birthday to the best of all window managers!
