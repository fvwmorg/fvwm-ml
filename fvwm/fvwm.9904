The problem is with windows that don't have handles.

I have noticed this on the FvwmPager and my workman windows.  I use:

DeskTopSize 3x3
AddToFunc InitFunction	"I"	Module FvwmPager 0 0
Style "FvwmPager"   StaysOnTop, CirculateSkip
Style "WorkMan"     CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip

I say the pager does not get the focus because the window highlight 
stays on the previous window, and if I start typing after the first
click in the pager the keystrokes go to the previous window.

To illustrate the point, I clicked on emamcs and it now has focus.
Now I will click on the pager.

I just clicked on the pager and the virtual window did not move.
I then started typing,  and as you can see, the text is being sent
to this window.

Now to click on the pager again.

This time, the virtual window changed.  The emacs window still has focus
since I can type without having to do anything else.  As long as I don't
click anywhere else, each click in the pager window will cause the appropriate
thing to happen.  If I click on another window, say the emacs one again,
the process repeats (ie the first click to the pager is lost).

I like the ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick option, but I find it unusable
with this little quirk.

I am trying to get FvwmButtons to Swallow Eterm but am having trouble
--no swallowing is taking place.  If I use xterm instead everything works
fine.  Here is the code I am using.

This works fine for xterm
*FvwmButtons(6x1, Swallow "FvwmXconsole" 'Exec xterm -C -bg black -fg
turquoise  -name FvwmXconsole -geometry -0-0 -fn 
-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*')


This dosen't swallow Eterm
*FvwmButtons(6x1, Swallow "FvwmXconsole" 'Exec Eterm -CO -g +0+0 -f
yellow')


Any Ideas?

-Rob

Well, how would we know which of the eight sides and corners
you wanted to grab? If you click in the center of the window
there is no way to guess the direction in which you want the
resize.

Perhaps this might work:

Divide the window into 9 sectors. If the pointer is in any
sector but #5 it it warped to the corresponding spot on the
edge of the window:

7-------8-------9
|   |       |   |
|s7  \ s8  /  s9|
|  +---------+  |
|_ |         | _|
| \|         |/ |
|  |         |  |
|  |         |  |
4  |    5    |  6
|  |         |  |
|s4|   s5    |s6|
|_/|         |\_|
|  |         |  |
|  +---------+  |
|s1  / s2  \  s3|
|   |       |   |
1-------2-------3

E.g.: Click in (s7) -> pointer warped to (7).

Any comments?

---- a few hours later ----

I've made an experimental patch with this:

  if (pointer is within <tolerance> pixels from a corner or the side bars)
  {
    Warp pointer to corresponding corner or center of side bar.
  }

where <tolerance> (in x/y direction) is defined as:

  5% of window's original width/height,
  if this is less than 20 pixels
    25% of window's original width/height
    if this is more than 20 pixels
      20 pixels

In other words: try resizing from FvwmButtons or a root menu,
click near the edge of a window and tell me what you think
about what happens.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Ah yes, now I see it. Seems the ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick doesn't
cooperate with windows that don't want the input focus. The fix was
easy. There was even a comment in events.c that whis was a know bug.

Well, I find it unusable with and without the quirk (The whole
ClickToFocus idea) :*)

Hello!

I started using X Window and fvwm2 again after awhile (I used text mode
exclusively :-)) and I can't seem to find a certain functionality that I
could swear was there last time I used fvwm2.

I need the Pager to scroll by 100% ONLY when I'm moving a window and hit
the edge of the screen with a mouse pointer.  Otherwise, hitting the edge
with the pointer shouldn't switch to another screen.

Basically, I need the "EdgeScroll 0 0" functionality but also to be able
to move windows across screens more easily.

Thanks in advance!

Please send your replies to me directly because I'm not subscribed to the
list.  Thanks!

I've looked for the same thing, and couldn't get this behavior without
modifying the source.  I may have just missed something, though.  But here's
the simple patch I use to "fix" this behavior.  Apply it to fvwm/events.c...

I do it this way (and it works well):

  EdgeResistance   250 10
  EdgeScroll       0 0

Propably you didn't have the proper EdgeResistance.

Hello!

I've upgraded my ancient fvwm2-2.0.46 to 2.1.10 and in the changelog file
I've found the following entry:

	* fvwm/move.c (moveLoop): fixed bug: moving windows over page
	boundaries not possible if EdgeScroll 0 0 was used.

So, that explains everything. :-)  Problem fixed.  Thanks to everybody who 
responded!

P.S. I'm aware of fvwm 2.2 but installing it would require some major
changes to my Debian system.

Best regards,

Weird... in what way does 2.2 involve "major changes" which aren't also
involved in installing 2.1.10?

In Debian, fvwm 2.2 requires X version 3.3.2.3 and I'm presently at X
3.3.1.  Actually, not a big deal but I just don't have the time for
downloading the necessary packages with my 1.44k modem right now.

Oh, you mean the debian package for 2.2.  You could always get the
source tarball for 2.2 and build it yourself, you know (I assume that's
how you installed 2.1.10?)

Please excuse my ignorance. I've downloaded fvwm2-2 and I want to install it
on my Solaris 2.6 machine. I have gcc version 2.8.1. I ran configure and
received the following output:

Questions:
What are the prerequisites to installing fvwm?
What do I do next? Does anyone have Step-by-step instructions for installing
on a new Solaris 2.6 system?

I've checked the archives and haven't found anything that's clear to me.

Thanks!

Every time that I tried to run fvwm I get this error:

ld.so.1: fvwm: fatal: libXext.so.6.3: open failed: No such file or
directory
Killed

However the file does exist in the X11 dir. Does fvwm has some
assumption about the location of X11? Are all X11 distribution has the
same structure? How do I till fvwm that the file does exist in
/usr/local/X11?

This is probably stupid, but I can't seem to figure out how to do this 
inside of fvwm2. I'm running 2.2.

>From inside an xterm, I can type 

xterm -bg black -fg green -e telnet foo.org

and it works, but

AddToMenu "Terms" "Sessions" Title
+ "osiris" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/bin/telnet foo.org

fails with no error. Or maybe one shows up, but it's inside the xterm
which is closing too fast to see it. 

If I change the above to

+ "osiris" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/bin/telnet

I get a telnet prompt.

Hello,

I have been looking over the man pages but I can figure this one out.

How can I force a window to map under my current cursor location?  For example
in XV the deleting confirmation always displays under my cursor (I thing XV itse
lf controls that ) but I have another program that has a confirmation window
that I have to do hunt down with the mouse to hit O.K.  So can I create a style
or something to force a location ?

Thanks.  Using fvwm2 2.2

I wanted to submit a bug report for this, but I'm not sure whether
it's a code error or just missing documentation.

There seems to be a 127-character limit for line length of
FvwmButtons configuration entries in .fvwm2rc. I discovered this while
trying to add buttons to my wharf-work-alike configuration. I did some 
testing to discover the limit. The line

*MyWharf(Icon wp-icon.xpm, Title "A Very Long title Indeed", Action
"Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -title "Thisonestillworks5678")

will parse, but 

*MyWharf(Icon wp-icon.xpm, Title "A Very Long title Indeed", Action
"Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -title "Thisoneistoolong456789")

causes FvwmButtons to fail initialization. There's nothing in my
.xsession-errors related to this.

  Well, I can only speak for SunOS/Solaris, but when linking proggies,
runtime libraries' locations *are* held in the exe. If said .so file
doesn't exist at runtime, the runtime linker runs through the directories
specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (although I think there's another one as well
that's runtime only - this one affects the functioning of ld as well ...
plus ISTRT it's possible to embed a search path in the exe at link time on
top of that).

  Anyway, the upshot is: make sure your X lib directory in somewhere in
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running fvwm2. To test whether it *will* work, use
'ldd exename', which'll list the runtime libraries required by the prog. &
whether they can be found in the current envorinment.

I can't believe this works. At least it doesn't for me and it
shouldn't. You have to quote the command after -e. Otherwise
xterm tries to interpret foo.org as a parameter, fails, prints
an error message and exits. The proper command line is:

  xterm -bg black -fg green -e 'telnet foo.org'

  Ah. Does Jim then have a telnet 'default connection' environment
variable set up in his normal command-line state that's passed to the
xterm if issued from there, but not when issued from fvwm?

  That'd explain why it appears to work ...

Well not to disagree but this works everytime for me 
AddToMenu OtherPlat "cosmo" Exec xterm -geometry 80x50 -T COSMO -e telnet cosmo.marymount.edu &

xterm(1)
-e program [ arguments ... ]
             This option specifies the program (and  its  command
             line  arguments)  to be run in the xterm window.  It
             also sets the window title and icon name to  be  the
             basename of the program being executed if neither -T
             nor -n are given on the command line.  This must  be
             the last option on the command line.

the reason it must be last is that the first arg after -e is the
executable and everything else is considered to be arguments for it.

My question would be what version of fvwm arge you using, I know this
works in 2.0.46, 2.2, and 2.3

i would like to start netscape as a full screen window that cannot be moved
or resized but i would also like any child windows that netscape spawns to
*be* movable *and* resizable.  i can start it full screen with -geometry and
specify 'Style "Netscape" NoHandles, NoTitle, BoundaryWidth 0'  but this
makes all the child windows unmoveable too.  is there a way to do what i
want using the fvwm config file?  if i can't do it through the config file,
could i modify the fvwm source or would i have to modify netscape?  i am
using version 1.23b but i could upgrade if i need to.

thanks in advance :)

You don't need handles, frames and the like to move or resize windows.
Do something like:

Key F7		A	M	Move
Key F8		A	M	Resize

(Meta F7/F8 anywhere move and resize windows)

  /What/ is vn. 1.23b??


  I'm using NS 4.51 - I use 'Style "Navigator" ...' (the window's class,
from xprop), not 'Netscape': it doesn't affect the popups. That might
afford you a little more control.

Its always a good idea to tell us what release you are using.
In the latest snapshots, fvwm2 will create one for you.

In  the  source distribution      you    should be  able    to    find
sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc.  Copy that to your home directory
and name it ".fvwm2rc".

Actually, THIS doesn't work for me, and it shouldn't. If you run xterm
this way, xterm will try to execvp "telnet foo.org", literally. It will
then fail upon not finding the command "telnet foo.org". 

Of course, you may be using a smarter version of xterm than I. My version
is XFree86 3.3.3(88) .

As for the original poster, this is what I use in FvwmWharf in fvwm2 v2.2:

*FvwmWharf ant      Ant.xpm Exec exec rxvt -e telnet ant
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

you can just replace rxvt with xterm and it should work.

This will work, but is likelyt o lead to other problems in the future.

The _BEST_ way to handle this, if you are on a system like Solaris that
requires it, is to use the -R option on the link line (or set
LD_RUN_PATH before linking) so that the pathname is built into the app.

Then you don't need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Really?  _Really_?  1.23b?  Wow, you must win some kind of prize for the
oldest version of fvwm still in regular use :)

I have absolutely no idea if you can do what you want with this version
of fvwm.  I don't even remember what this version could or couldn't do.

apologies for previous micorsquish garbage attached to my e-mail, i hope
they're gone now.  still stuck on ms outlook for e-mail :(

to dan espen:
key bindings would work great but i'm looking for something graphical and
more intuitive.  this is a kiosk type deal and i can't expect the user to
know about key strokes.  also, i believe this would also leave move/resize
functionality in the first window.

to neil bird:
this didn't seem to work with version 4.08, my class is 'Netscape' and
resource is 'Navigator' for both first and successive windows (not
popups/transients, but File->Navigator Window type windows)  i don't think i
metioned that i'm running 4.08 navigator *standalone*.  it may be different
in 4.08 full blown communicator or 4.51.  i'll look at these in more detail,
thanks.

to paul smith:
i have older ones if you think i need them.  just kidding :)  as i said
before i'm happy to upgrade fvwm to a newer version if need be.  do you know

Nope, still there.  Don't know anything about outlook, but in NS mail
there's a preference that says something like "Prefer rich text" which
you need to uncheck to avoid HTML.

Even in the latest versions of fvwm, you can only change the styles of
windows if their resource class or instance names are different.

You will need to investigate further; the FvwmIndentify module (if you
have it in your version!) will help with this.  Select the main window
and then the popups and see if you can see a difference.

I just tried with my copy of standalone Navigator, comparing the root
window to the "Find" dialogue.  The class of both is "Netscape", but the
resource of the root is "Navigator" while the resource of the dialogue
is "findDialog_popup".  So, you should be able to use these differences
to set the style for the root differently than the others.

Actually, the man page also says you can change styles based on the
window name; I wonder if you can set the netscape root window name to
something rather than have it change for each page title as it does
normally?

Hmm...they know how  to resize and move  windows  with the  mouse, but
don't know how to use keys.  How about a big fat "MOVE" label on the
F7 key?

Or...you could bind the mouse in a window to do a move, if you have
a spare mouse button.  Netscape is primarily concerned with buttons
1 and 3, 2 doesn't appear to be used:

Mouse 2 W A Popup Move-or-Resize

Of course this makes it difficult to use button 2 in other windows,
but if this is a Netscape only application.

Or...you might consider putting the frame back  on Netscape, just size
and position the window so that the frame is off-screen.

There is a German word `Tinnef' (regional, colloquial) which means,
more or less, `crap'.

So, Germans immediately understand what this is all about :-)

He is talking about the windows you get with Alt-N or with the `New
Navigator Window' entry in the File menu.

The popup thingies are easy, but the other navigator windows are hard.

To remove ms-tnef content (incidentally, it's microsoft's
html-in-email content-type, base64 encoded... blech!) you need to set
your preference to compose as plaintext... In your Outlook options go
to the "Mail format" tab and "send in this message format: plain
text". May the world be a better place...

I think this is probably the best approach. When a netscape window
opens it should be titled something strange like: "Netscape: blah blah
blah blah". Try matching your resource/class string to match all
Netscape-related windows and set for handles, etc. Then follow that
style line with one that matches just the starting title of the window
and strip the handles, etc. Should work...

Oh.  Ouch.

Well, I guess the only possible answer is using window titles.
Actually, (I've never used this feature) I assume fvwm2 must match on
the title of the window when it's created for the Style, right?  (Unless
a restart is done of course).

If so, if you can get your netscape to start with some initial page with
a really odd <TITLE></TITLE>, you can match on that and as long as the
default page is different for new windows they should appear with
different styles.

Right?

Ah, but button 2 does have a pretty useful feature:

If you have a URL (or something that you could type into the "Location:"
box in Netscape) selected, and you click button 2 in a Netscape window
while the pointer is an arrow (not over a link), it opens that URL in
the window you clicked button 2. Very nice.

Button 2 is also a short cut for "open link in new window" when it IS
over a link.

I don't see why the Style selection

Style "Netscape:*" 

wouldn't do what is being discusssed.  I examined the Netscape subwindows
on my Linux setup and the browser windows have titles like
"Netscape:<stuff>", while the others have different titles, 
Class "Netscape", and Resource values like "AddressBook" and "MailThread".
I have never tried to navigate this terrain before, but setting a Style
matching the Resource value "Netscape" and following it with another Style
callout matching "Netscape:*" should result in the browser windows having
the first configuration and the other popups having the second.  Or maybe
I am wrong again?

All windows you get with "New Navigator Window" are "browser windows"
and all have the same title format ("Netscape: ...") and the same
class/resource strings.

Well, there is a limit, but it's not 127 bytes. I can't remember
exactly, but it's either 256 bytes or 1000 bytes. Which version
of fvwm are you using (the latest official release is 2.2).

Is this exactly the line in your config file? You can't use double
quotes inside double quotes. This one is correct:

  *MyWharf(Icon wp-icon.xpm, Title "A Very Long title Indeed", Action
  "Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -title 'Thisoneistoolong456789'")
                                   ^^^                    ^^^^

That's grey theory. On my system xterm requires the argument after
-e to be quoted, no matter if I run it from a shell or from my
config file. It complains about 'foo.org' not being understood
as a command line option to xterm. No matter what, it's not a
fvwm bug.

Is there a menu available which will move a window to a selected
desktop?

Also, what is the method used to determine where the iconified windows
appear? I find that a lot of the icons appear underneath my button bar
and I'd like the placement to choice areas of the screen where there
aren't other active windows, if possible.

Hmm, that's difficult. Placing windows is one of the tasks the window
manager is supposed to do. The problem is: how can fvwm know that *you*
specified the position for the window. In X, when a window is created
it has to supply a preferred position to the window manager. This position
depends on your X resources. So if an application tells the window manager
it prefers to be at +0+0, how does the window manager disstinguish between
the application default and the user's geometry spec?

What do you mean with 'menu'? There is a function to do that:
MoveToDesk.

You can use the IconBox style like this:

  Style * IconBox +0 +0 +63 +767

There are a few other styles that influence icon placement.
You should have a loot at the manpage for 'Style'.

When Netscape is started, the window title is something strange
initially, but get changed after a few seconds.  If somebody is able
to see this, some use might be made of it.

(I think the window title is Netscape-4.05-990223 or something like
that, with the compilation date maybe?)

At work, I'm using ctwm, and I started two xterms:

  xterm -geometry +50+50
  xterm

xprop on these windows returned:

WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
                user specified location: 50, 50
                user specified size: 644 by 388
                program specified size: 644 by 388
                program specified minimum size: 12 by 20
                program specified resize increment: 8 by 16
                program specified base size: 4 by 4
                window gravity: NorthWest

for the first one, and

WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
                user specified size: 644 by 404
                program specified size: 644 by 404
                program specified minimum size: 12 by 20
                program specified resize increment: 8 by 16
                program specified base size: 4 by 4

for the second one.

The difference seems to be in the `user specified location' line.  I'd
assume that you see `program specified location' if the program has
specified that location.

I don't know anything about the underlying C functions used by xprop.

I have hacked ctwm to automatically focus transient windows.  I.e.,
when a window is first created (or mapped, not sure which -- I don't
really grok X11 programming at all), it is checked whether it is a
transient window.  If it is, it is focussed.

This is wonderful if you use MouseFocus or SloppyFocus and bring up
popup windows, for example with Alt-F in Netscape.

Fvwm has a different way to solve this problem: by telling all
Netscape windows to be ClickToFocus, you achieve a similar result.

But it is not quite the same.

How about implementing this simple change for Fvwm, too?

Suggested improvement: only assign focus to the transient if it is a
transient_for the currently focussed window.

Suggested improvement 2: keep a history of focussed windows, like
this: transient window 1 appears, gets focus.  User does something,
which causes transient window 2 to appear, which also gets focus.
User does something, which causes transient window 2 to disappear.
Then, transient window 1 should get the focus again.


Opinions?

If that's true, you can stare at that particular title all you want by typing
"about:" in the location bar.  Then you'll be able to see the title w/o having
to watch for a flicker.  That being said,  I don't see the "flicker effect" when
I launch a new window, but it could just be the version of Netscape I'm using...

Hi - I installed fvwm2 v2.2 and it runs sort of but there are problems.

The last line of my .xinitrc file is:
	RunWM.Fvwm95

It all starts up, a ps shows:
	fvwm2 -cmd FvwmM4 -debug /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4

However no button bar or pager appears. .FVWM2-errors sez:
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmTaskBar' in ModulePath 'FVWMDIR/'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmButtons' in ModulePath 'FVWMDIR/'

Looking around it appears FVWMDIR isn't getting set correctly. Looking at
the /tmp/fvwm2rcaXXXXX files generated, ModulePath isn't getting set. It's
supposed to be:
ModulePath	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/

...but instead it is just:
ModulePath	FVWMDIR/

So I'm wondering since I installed fvwm2 as root, is there a directory
access problem now that I'm trying to run it as joe user? 

How is FVWMDIR supposed to be set? I tried setting it as an environment
var in .bash_profile but that didn't help.

There's the line in fvwm2rc.m4 that talks about defineing the
FVWM_USER_MODULE_PATH "...the only file the casual user needs to worry
about..." What am I supposed to be doing here?

What if any .fvwm2rc file might I need in my home dir to run fvwm95?



Thanks for any pointers you can give me!

- Ross

Hi everyone,

I'm new to this list. Sorry if this problem has been coverd before, I
didn't find anything about it in the archive...

So, here is what happens when I try to toggle between windows on different 
desktops, for example :

- windows "a" and "b" on desktop 0
- window "c" on desktop 1
- focus on "a"
- windowlist "a,b,c" (result of the built-in command "WindowList
NoDeskSort")

if I do the following actions :

1) Prev [c] FlipFocus
  
   the windowlist becomes "c,a,b" (this is the normal behaviour)

2) Prev [*] FlipFocus

  the focus gets on window "a" and the window list becomes "a,b,c"  
(instead of "a,c,b" which is, if I understood well the documentation, the
expected behaviour)

3) Prev [*] FlipFocus

  At that time, I would expect the focus to get back to c, but since the
previous windowlist is wrong, it gets to b.

NB : when all windows are on the same desktop, FlipFocus works fine.

Has anyone any idea to fix this problem ?

I'm running fvwm 2.2 on redhat 5.1.

Thanks in advance.

Denis

With 2.2 the WindowList, Next and Prev commands all follow the same list
from the same point which explains 3).  What happens at 2) is that
something is causing window b to move up the windowlist above window c. 
Do you use MouseFocus or SloppyFocus?  If so it could be that when the
desks are switched to show window a the pointer may be over window b
when it appears. I found that the only way to switch desks without
getting extra focuses was to first move the pointer out of the way (e.g.
left hand side of FvwmButtons).

Cheers,
Tim.

Good idea.

The history is already there. The new bit would be to transfer the
focus back to the previous window.

We would hope that you can build with any compiler, including
any version of gcc.

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your help.

In fact, all my windows are on "ClickToFocus", so there must not be any intermediate change in the windowlist due to the pointer position after the desk change (moreover, I use warptowindow so that the pointer goes directly in the window that gets the focus). 

After several tests, it really seems that my problem is related to the fact that I switch focus from one window on one desktop to another window on another desktop, everything being OK when all my windows are on the same desktop. But I don't see the beginning of an explanation to it.

Do you have any other idea ?

Cheers,

Denis

I see some functions in fvwm2rc which are bound to the command xdpr.
I've done my best to locate the source for this package on the
net...I've found several versions of the docs, but no source. Anyone
care to tell me where to look? Thanks.

You can put it there yourself. Just resend both suggestions as separate
mails to the bug tracking system (preferrably with 'enhancement: ...'
as the subject).

Hi Tim,

I did another test so I want to add this to my previous message. 

It appears that when all my windows are in "SloppyFocus", everything works fine. So you guessed right thinking that the problem was related with the focus method. But I still don't understand why it doesn't work when I'm in "ClickToFocus" which is the focus method I would like to use.

Cheers,

Denis

I haven't yet had a chance to look at it, but firstly, well done, and
secondly: have you been able to include all of the icons from the
present FVWM and FVWM 95 packages?

Thanks,

I think I posted this before but I never got it in my mail box so I'll
repeat it.

Lots of times I shade windows and put them at the bottom of the screen to
keep them outta the way.  Is it possible to now maybe with setting some
edge resistance or other setting to make the window pop up the screen then
unshade so that if I unshade it to check something it does roll down off
the screen?  If not could this be something that could be add as a feature
either by maybe a style command or something?

Ummm I guess I really should proof read before I send I mean so it
doesn't shade to a different screen, but rather to the one I'm on.

Hello,

I am writing a Xlib application that needs to take over the entire
screen (or at least a virtual desktop).  I specify my window size the
same as the screen size (1600x1200) and I also specify a origion of x,
y.  When fvwm sees that I want to place a window that big, it requires
me to manually place it.

My question is:  are there any WMHints that you have not documented that
I can pass to the WM to force it to place my window at 0,0 (upper left)
and require the whole screen?  I currently am using PropMotifWmHints
which I pass a 0L flag for window decorations, and the decorations go
away as expected.  (I'm not using motif btw, but I found the struct on
the net somewhere.)  I would like to do the same with window placement.

I'm running fvwm 1.24r on redhat linux 5.1.

Any insight is greatly appricated.

Walt

p.s. I'm not on the list so a cc to me would be great!

Done. The GrabFocusTransient style does this in the development
sources.

Looking through the recent changelog on the cvs fvwm2 version I see a new
process style.  ClickToFocus implies GrabFocus while Sloppy and Mouse
Focuse imply GrabFocusOff.  Well I am assuming as much but I thought I'd
ask anyway, I happen to us sloppyfocus and grabfocus, can I still do this
or is this just a default setup?

| I would like to hear your comments about the project and its first
| public release in particular.

I think it would be a good idea to use the LGPL instead of the GPL for
this package.  Using the GPL would prohibit the use of it in
proprietary packages as I understand the GPL.  Unless this is
intentional, I'd propose to use the LGPL instead.

It's the default. But make sure you set GrabFocus *after* SloppyFocus
since ...Focus resets the GrabFocus style to the default.

Ok new question, can you disable icons fonts at all or on a window by
window basis?  What I have is I run Licq and I like to keep it iconized
but since the default icon has a little licq ident thing above it, it
makes and icon font for it useless and also makes the icon take up more
space then the standard icons I use.

Is anyone really even clear how XPMs could be construed as being
"source" or "binary"? XPMs in their native format *are* source (or it
looks suspiciously similar to C to me). But one never "compiles"
XPMs...  There's just the image XPMs, in whatever form you want to
consider them to be in, "source" or "binary". Haven't looked too
carefully at GPL/LGPL lately but I'm pretty sure it distinguishes
between binaries and sources, and I have no idea which you'd consider
XPMs to be.

Nope, that's wrong. I have seen C code that simply #includes XPM
files and passes the defined structures to other functions (I assume
from the xpm library).

Neither do I. Perhaps we could ask the author(s) of the xpm package?

I wonder whether we want this?  If a proprietary package wants to use
these free icons, they will either have to ensure that their package
does not actually depend upon the icons, but the icons in wm-icons are
just a nice addition to the proprietary package which a user can
choose to add on should they wish, or they will have to release their
package under the GPL or similar free license.

The LGPL (currently being renamed "The Lesser General Public Licence")
was only created for such things as libc which would not have been
used at all if they couldn't be used by non-free software.  I do not
see the same argument at all for the wm-icons distribution; after all,
the FVWM distribution will probably (if it hasn't already) remove all
of the icons from itself, and instead recommend wm-icons.  There: you
already have a nice user base.  If, however, FVWM had a license which
said "no non-free software may be run under this window manager", then
(almost) noone would use FVWM, which would be ludicrous and
self-defeating.  The cases are not similar.

So I strongly propose remaining with the full GPL.

As you must have guessed, the man page should have said:

              IconFill left top

This is fixed in the latest CVS sources.

Don't know if this makes sense...or if it is already done, but I'd like
an option so that when my mouse cursor is on a titlebar button, the
button highlights. I've had the button on what I thought was 'close' and
done a resize too many times. I've changed the cursor style from the
hand to a box, and that seems to help. I think the problem with the hand
is defining the hot-spot.

What I'm suggesting would simply lightup the button which would be
activated if you click the mouse.

i have fvwm2 2.0.46 
is there such thing on latest versions ? 

it would work like 'StayOnTop'.  Only that obviously, the window with
such attribute set (via hot key) would stay out of the way, until 
the attribute were changed via a hot key.  Then it would be subject to
being circulated as per default.

i would like that better than iconifying the window.  i have a hard 
time keeping track of my icons and their contents.

After I do a restart of fvwm2 (from my menu with Restart fvwm2),
debugging messages are displayed in my console window.  I don't want
to see the debugging messages.  When I initially start fvwm2, I don't
see the debugging messages.

I tried recompiling fvwm2 to fix the problem.  I ran
	configure --disable-debug-msgs
but that didn't help.  Anyway, I thought that disabling was the
default.

Is there anyway to delete a title bar button that has been previously
defined?  I looked through the docs and could find no way of doing this.
I would think something like,

DestroyButton 1
or
DestroyButton all

would be great.  The latter would delete button 1 and all mouse bindings
associated with it and the former would remove all button setups and
bindings. If a mouse binding is set to button 1 and no ButtonStyle is
defined for button 1 then a default button is used, so the destruction
of the button must also unbind the mouse.  This could be useful in a
function that is used to redefine the button setup for title bars or
other change a theme on the fly that has different amounts of buttons
defined, etc.

I am using fvwm 2.2.

Thanks

Strange you ask -- I was asked the same yesterday by a Debian
developer.  The answer is to use the Mouse command as follows:

Mouse 0 4 A -

which removes any function definition from title button 4.  The rules
are that:

              The highest odd numbered button which has an action
              bound  to it determines the number of buttons drawn
              on the left side of the  title  bar.   The  highest
              even  number  determines  the  number or right side
              buttons which are drawn.  Actions can be  bound  to
              either mouse buttons or keyboard keys.

(BTW, I also found a glitch in the fvwm2.1 manpage which means that
half of the first sentence of the "Mouse" section vanishes.  So you
might want to look at the actual source for the man page rather than
the output of man in this case.)

HTH,

   Julian

Hi there!

I'd like to put a screenshot of my FvwmPager (which is swallowed by FvwmButtons)
on my machine's homepage using some SSI or CGI.
http://www.gisser.de - only when box & ISDN are up.

I'm quite a newbie to Linux programming.
Wrote my first real bash script yesterday.
Don't know much about Fvwm internals beyond .fvwmrc

Maybe someone has a ready script or some hint.

Thanks in advance,
--Martin

Something about having a quote at the begining of the line.  Moving the
'-' to the previous line fixes it.  I don't know nroff so this was just
a lucky guess.

xwd -id $(xlswins | grep "Fvwm Pager" | awk '{print $1}') | xwdtopnm |
ppmtogif > pager.gif

(all on one line) will give you a pager.gif from a ksh/bash script.  You
could run this from cron to give a snapshot at regular intervals.  If
you're worried about being sued for using GIF software you could use
ppmtojpeg or even pnmtopng.

It would be nice to set a short expiry date on the picture so that
clients don't use an old cached copy but I don't know how to do that.

Cheers,
Tim.

Greetings, 

For various reasons, I need to determine if the window manager my application is 
running under is fvwm.  In the past, for olwm cde etc, I've been able to make 
that determination by looking at root window props.  It would appear that fvwm 
does not set any identifiers on the root window...I searched a portion of the 
archive but failed to find any discussions on this matter.  Is there a way that 
I can determine fvwm is indeed running?

Fine.  I like that: Saying it all with one command line.  Now I know what to do.

Alas, xlswins seems not to be readily available for the mortal Linux user.
But I found xwininfo.  I'll try to extract the window id from there.

Thanks,
  Martin

OK, I'm using Fvwm 2.2, and I like it.  I'm also using XFCE 2.4.0 as a toolbar 
and I want to migrate to using FvwmWharf instead.  What I need is a way to 
flip between desktops with a function key.  The appropriate snips of my 
.fvwm2rc:

DeskTopSize 3x3

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+		"I" Desk 0 3
+		"I" Module FvwmPager 0 3

AddToFunc "RestartFunction"
+		"I" Desk 0 3
+		"I" Module FvwmPager 0 3

I want to keep the 3x3 size and 4 desks.  The pager works fine with XFCE.  I 
tried something like this to flip between desks:


Key F1          RTSF    A       GotoPage 1 4
Key F2          RTSF    A       GotoPage 1 3
Key F3          RTSF    A       GotoPage 1 2
Key F4          RTSF    A       GotoPage 1 1

This doesn't work, it just bounces me around on the screens on one desk.  I need to bounce to different desks.

OK, so what am I doing wrong here??

Here's what I did:

  xwd -silent -name "Desk 0" | xwdtopnm  > pager.pnm

(and then turned on the GIMP)

But
1.) I only get the green channel 
2.) Parts of other windows overlapping FvwmPager are also rendered

See http://www.gisser.de/pager.xwd.pnm.gif and http://www.gisser.de/pager.real.gif
Maybe this is more something for a pure X mailing list...
Seems I'll wind up doing this with the GIMP...

Can anybody tell me how to automatically raise the FvwmButtons window before doing
the xwd stuff ?

Use Desk rather than GotoPage to change desks rather than pages.

You're using the wrong command. You need to use the 'Desk' or 'GotoDesk'
command (GotoDesk is a synonym for Desk that is new in the current
development sources. Only Desk will work in 2.2, but I plan to phase
the desk command out in falour of GotoDesk some day).

I am still useing Fvwm version 1.24r I would like to know if I can source
another file into the ~/.fvwmrc file. That way I can have all my menu
definitions in another file. 

If that isn't possible then can Fvwm2 do that? And one more thing is there
an easy way to take my fvwm1 file and convert it to use in fvwm2? Thanks
again for your help.

I don't know about 1.24 the official release 2.2 can do it (Read <filename>).
There is a shell script to convert v1 config files to v2 config files:
utils/fvwmrc_convert in the distribution file. Feel free to ask the mailing
lists if you have any trouble with the conversion.

I'm not sure, but I've got a similar problem.  I've been using Pager inside
(swallowed) the FvwmButtons bar, but recently switched to gnome-panel
because of its autohide.

But I can't get gnome-panel to swallow FvwmPager.  (it'll grab all my
non-Fvwm goodies, though)  Is it possible to swallow icons?  (I like Pager
iconified, though it really doesn't make much difference :)

I'm also having difficulty getting FvwmPager to use its IconGeometry
configuration.  (Pager shows itself in the specified position inside itself,
but the real Pager window isn't in the right place, as if it forgot to tell
X to position its icon/window)

One more question. When I'm in netscape and goto the preferences, I loose
the title bar and handles. I am not sure why. I've tried commenting out
all my Style lines, especaily my Style "*" line but even with the default
fvwm config there are no title bars on my preferences window. Can anyone
shed some light on this? I can send anyone my .fvwmrc file if they can
help. Thanks again.

Again I don't know how it is in 1.24, but with 2.2 you need to
add this style:

  Style "*" DecorateTransient

   or

  Style "*" DecorateTransients

(I'm not sure which one is correct). Insted of "*" you might
say "netscape*".

It sounds like you want a style flag something like

Style whatever ShadeToBottom (with a default of ShadeToTop)

so that when you shade a window it shrinks down to the bottom edge of
the window.
It's ceratilnly possible now that we have plenty of roo for more style
flags.
Could you put in a bug report please?

Cheers,
Tim.

	This is the correct one, if my fvwm2rc is any indication.

	However, in version 1, DecorateTransients (note the different spelling)
was a standalone command; it hadn't yet been made into a style option,
so it's an all or nothing proposition.

	Bob also asked:
>  
>  I would like to know if I can source another file into the ~/.fvwmrc file.

	As far as I can tell, there wasn't any such facility in version 1. In
version 2, you definitely can. My .fvwm2rc is little more than a
skeleton containing a bunch of read commands, and the real work is done
by about a dozen other files sourced via those read commands.

	I believe Dominik mentioned the conversion script. I can't comment on
its effectiveness, because I've never used it: I just gritted my teeth
and did the whole thing by hand years ago. But as he said, feel free to
ask us if you run into any snags.

	Hmm...I was thinking along different lines - variable title-bar
positioning, like BottomTitleBar (or even on the sides). A lot more
work, but it would be a nice enhancement.

	Do you tend to place the same set of shaded windows at the bottom, such
that using a style for this set of windows that had the title bar on the
bottom would be feasible? Then the unshading operation could simply go
upward instead of downward. Just a thought....

Well I was thinking of the non style command since as you ask no I don't tend to
place just certain windows along the bottom.  More to the point I was thinking
along the lines of an addition to the windowshade function, something like check
window size, if size is > distance to screen edge then move window up difference.
I only trouble I can see having the reshade thing remember where the title bar
was.

A side title bar sounds like a neat idea, however IMHO that is more of too much
pretty option rather then fuctional.  If done pretty soon people will want shaped
title bars and then we'll be at E.

	Ok, sounds like Tim's idea is more in sync with what you want.

	I still think Tim's on the right track as far as having the behavior
triggered by a style. You can always make it apply globally with Style
*. If we add this feature, somebody will definitely want it to work the
new way sometimes, and the current way at other times.

	I'm not sure I follow this. If the shaded title bar is moved to the
bottom of the screen, then the window is unshaded, it seems to me that
the window would grow from the bottom of the screen to its full height,
and the title bar would appear at the top of the window. Are you
suggesting that the window should revert to the position where it was
before it was shaded (can't say I like the idea, particularly with
animated shading).

	I don't think so...not with the current crew of developers!

	Actually, shaped title bars wouldn't be that awful. There's been some
talk of allowing the building of window decorations to move out into
modules. If this is done, and someone's interested in working on modules
to do fancy decorations (optional, of course), then a lot of creative
things could be done without needlessly bloating the core of FVWM or
cheating those users who still want a relatively lean and clean WM.

	(And a WM doesn't necessarily have to be bloated to implement shaped or
side title bars, as attested to by wm2 and vtwm.)

This means that configure thinks you're using a cross-compiler.  This
usually means that it found a compiler that appears to run OK, but it
couldn't run even the simplest resulting output file.

Look closely at the output of configure before it gets here and find the
check for a C++ library; it'll say something like "checking for
cross-compiler"; see if it comes up with "yes" instead of "no".

Whenever this happens to me on Solaris it's because I installed GCC with
the "enable shared libs" option.  The way G++ (the GCC C++ compiler) is
installed, unless you put it in the "standard" place you _MUST_ supply a
-R option to it or it won't work.

G++ requires the libstdc++ library.  If you build this shared, then it
needs to be found at runtime.  On Solaris, using -L on the link line
isn't enough for that, you must use -R (or set LD_RUN_PATH).  So, it
links OK but then when you try to run the executable it doesn't work.

Things to do:

 1) Look for the configure output I noted above.

 2) Look in the config.log file and find the place where it looks for
    the C and C++ compilers, and see what errors you got.

 3) What I do to get it working is this (note, this only works in
    Bourne-ish shells like sh, ksh, bash, and zsh):

      $ LDFLAGS='-R/usr/local/lib' ./configure ...

    Replace /usr/local with whatever prefix you used to install GCC.

I want to change the size of the title bar for any window.
How do I do it ?

Ok rather simple, but then I never was very good at describing my point in
few words so here it is verbosly.

Say for instance I have icq running, I don't care much for icons but a
shaded icq window at the bottom of the screen is perfect most of the time.
Well say I want to check who is online or I just got a message, well I can
double click on the shaded tile bar at the bottom of the screen.  See who
is online or check the message, then double click the title bar again and
it will shade to the place it was before at the bottom of the screen.

I'm not sure growing upwards is really a neat feature either, like
people point out if someone has Animated Shading on.  Rather just move the 
title bar straight up x pixels and unshade it the way someone has choosen, 
to click again and in rolls up and pops back to where it was before.

And after thinking about it, the style "*" also seems the way to go.

I assume you mean something like the height.  The height is usually set
from the window title font size, however you can set it yourself with:

TitleStyle Height 24

Or any numbers you want, I prefer something like 15 myself since I only
have a 14" monitor.

Hi!

I plan to setup a www page with all kinds of fvwm2 rc files.

Is there any interests for this? Or is there alreay pages doing this?

Might be a good place to check out sample .fvwm2rc files for easy
building a custom one.

I might be totally wrong, but please let me know what you think.

Cheers

Anders

Dear Sir or Madam,
  Is there a way to dynamically bind menu items to keys? For example I
have
Key Escape      A       C      Menu RootMenu Nop
Key Escape      A       CS       WindowList

AddToMenu RootMenu	"Root Menu"	Title
+			"XTerm"		Exec exec xterm 
+			"Rxvt"		Exec exec rxvt

in my .fvwm2rc and can hit C-S-Escape and then '3' to get the third window
on the list.  Is there a way to make the items in my RootMenu happen if I
do something like:

C-Escape X    >>> do the Xterm item
C-Escape R    >>> do the Rxvt item

I tried to find it in the RTFM, but I could not, I would expect it to be
in the AddToMenu section of the man page as something like:

If the menu-label contains an ampersand character '&' then the character
following the ampersand will activate the menu item.  Case is disregarded,
and if two or more instances of the character are selected, then the
selection cycles between the items, and 'enter' is used to select the
item.  The menu will display the item with the letter underlined. For
Example

AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu"       Title
     +      "&Calculator*xcalc.xpm*" Exec xcalc
     +      "&Concentration"         Exec concentration
     +      "X&term"                 Exec xterm

Is there a way to do this that I was unable to find?

Thanks in advance for your time,

Dave.

You don't mention  the release you are  using, I'm going to assume you
are using 2.2.  Eaarlier releases could be different.

The way you did it is correct, except that fvwm2 does not like
2 menu entries with the same hot key, one of them will be ignored.

Check the man page for the term "hotkey".

Hi,

I am using fvwm2.2.

Is it possible to place the cursor automatically on a window
when it pops up, I mean to draw the FOCUS on that. For example,
when I do netscape find, netscape will open a dialog box
with title "Netscape: Find". I want to be able to give focus
to this whenever it pops up, by automatically placing the
cursor there. How can I do it ?

I'm not sure what netscape calls the find window off the top of my head.

As a matter of fact I'm not even sure if this is a GlobalOpts in 2.2 but
in 2.3.2 it's style "?netscape*" GrabFocus  seems to work find for me.

This style command will make any netscape window grap focus when it comes
up.

Multiple hotkey instances in a menu are allowed in the current CVS
code. Expect to see it in 2.4.

Otherwise, what Dan said.

  Here's what I have - BTW, it doesn't use the title of the window, but
the fact that all netscape's popups' classes have a "_popup" suffix:


AddToFunc NewWindowFunc  \
   "I" WindowId $0 (*_popup)       WarpToWindow 50 53


# FvwmEvent settings

*FvwmEventPassID

*FvwmEventCmd
*FvwmEvent        add_window NewWindowFunc


  ... and start FvwmEvent in InitFunc.


  Warning: I /think/ that the PassID flag was a patch I included at some
point; I can't remember if it's in the raw 2.2 release ...

No, you can't do it right now, but something like this is on my to-do
list. I'm currently working on a variety of similar things and menu
items will be one of them.

Apart from the (old?) GrabFocus option, the current development code
contains an option to automatically focus all transient windows.  I
find that nearly all windows which require input from the user are
transient windows, so this option can be turned on for all windows and
it does the right thing.

I'm using the FVWM version 2 that is distributed with Redhat
Linux 5.2.  It works great, but I cannot get mouse focus to happen.
I've changed the setting in the system.fvwm2rc file (wanting the change
to be global).  The appropriate line is now something like:

Style '*' MouseFocus

I have restarted fvwm2, but it always comes up in Click to Focus.
Can anyone please help with this?  I would love for fvwm2 on my Linux
box to work like it does on my Solaris system.  Thanks in advance to all

who reply.  Please CC/email me on all responses.....

Is there a "user-friendly" book or manual somewhere that explains the
different commands (e.g. goodstuff, the different values you can have in
different columns, etc).


When I move the mouse from one place to the other on the screen the
colors change: the pages in the background show a lot of color drain,
how can I fix this problem.

Thanks, Ruth Robinson

Anders,

There are some, but there's always room for more :-)  Stick the url up on
the list when it's setup. I'm always looking for better ideas, and I
suspect that I'm not alone.

Thanks Dan,

 I am using an earlier version, and I could not find any reference to the
hotkey on the http://www.fvwm.org/fvwm2.html man page.  I just installed
version 2.2, and its manpage does have hotkeys.  Is someone updating the
official page?

I ran the manpage through man2html to get:

http://bootp-6-214.bootp.virginia.edu/~drf5n/fvwm2.html

which is more current than the posted one.

Thanks,

Dave.

The RedHat 5.1 and 5.2 comes set up to look like Win95 all done by means
of an m4 preproccessed rc file and the system.fvwm2 (I presume you mean
the one in /etc/X11/fvwm2/) has nothing to do with it. You have to hack
around with th stuff in /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/*.m4 to change
anything. Personally I've never liked the 95 look anyway and I've
changed my .xinitrc and .Xclients stuff to run a more 'normal' looking
fvwm.

You should also look at the fvwm FAQ before asking questions like this
...

http://www.fvwm.org/FAQ.html

Specifically, question 3.1 :)

 I was using an earlier version 2.0.46, and I could not find any reference
to the hotkey on the http://www.fvwm.org/fvwm2.html man page which seems
to match the 2.0.46 release. I just installed version 2.2, and its manpage

Hi

I am using FVWM under Solaris 2.6. When I iconize a window I get the corresponding
Icon image for that Window. Similarly, when I iconize the xterm window I do not 
get the xterm icon image but just get a icon with the window title. I have already 
set 

Style "*term"    Icon xterm.xpm

in my .fvwm2rc file. I am able to use the icons when I set the Buttons etc...

Any idea what I need to do. Am I missing something here ????

Thanks

-Narayan

Duh, could you simply tell us which don't work? There are people
(e.g. me) who can't read RTF mails (or better: don't want to).

Jason,

  Dave is right, our online fvwm2 man page is seriously out of date.
I know the script I wrote to generate this stuff is a little primitive.

  I'll see if I can't put something a little cleaner together, if
you promise to run it...

Hello,
I've been trying to get FvwmCommand to work but to no avail. 

I load FvwmCommandS from my InitFunction in .fvwm2rc. But it refuses to
work returning "dead pipe message": "FvwmCommandS: dead pipe". 
 
I've tried both from source and fvwm2-2.2-5.i386.rpm but both ended up
same.

Here's little ptrace from running forced FvwmCommandS 1 1 1 1 1, plus i've
added few printfs.

Any idea what might be causing this?
I'm running Linux 2.2.6, glibc-2.1.1-5 and the rest..

Are you _sure_ you started as a module, as described in the man page?

This sounds like what you'd see if you just started it normally.  When
reporting bugs it's always best to cut and paste the problem
code/text/whatever; in this case please show us your InitFunction.  It
should contain something like:

  + "I" Module FvwmCommandS

Note the "Module" here, not "Exec" or similar.

  jl> Here's little ptrace from running forced FvwmCommandS 1 1 1 1 1,

You can't do that.  You can't invoke a module from the command line like
that.  Modules and FVWM uses pipes to talk to each other; a module
_MUST_ be spawned by the fvwm program so that these pipes exist
properly.  There's no way to test a module by running it from the
command line; the error you got is exactly what I'd expect to see.

HTH.

 Yes, at least i think so. Here's snippet from my .fvrm2rv
AddToFunc InitFvwmCommand "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+                         "I" Exec exec $HOME/scripts/focus-link.pl
+                         "I" Exec exec $HOME/scripts/focus-Netscape.pl


AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmAudio
+                         "I" Module FvwmButtons
+                         "I" InitFvwmCommand
+                         "I" exec rxvt -fn nh10 &
+                         "I" exec kohta 10 xscreensaver &
+                         "I" exec kohta 5 /home/jappe/bin/xsetroot &

 I did try to replace InitFvwmCommand with Module FvwmCommandS but it
resulted the same.

 Could you send your .fvwm2rc snippet to me? (Just in case ;))

It's a known bug that surfaced with recent Linux kernels. There's
an easy fix if you don't mind to patch the sources. In the file
modules/FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS.c you will find a line like

  SendText(Fd,"",0); /* tell fvwm that we are here */
             ^^^^
This has to be replaced with

  SendText(Fd," ",0); /* tell fvwm that we are here */
             ^^^^^

This has been fixed in the current stable fvwm release (2.2).
I has been in the development source in the current betas for
a few weeks.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I don't actually use this; I just use FvwmConsole if I want to talk to
fvwm (I don't have scripts that need to talk to it).

Hmmm.  I rebuild these things for every new release, but it seems I left
out the main page (!).

#!/usr/local/bin/zsh

for i in FvwmAudio FvwmAuto FvwmBacker FvwmBanner FvwmButtons FvwmCpp FvwmForm FvwmIconBox FvwmIconMan FvwmIdent FvwmM4 FvwmPager FvwmRearrange FvwmSave FvwmSaveDesk FvwmScroll FvwmTalk FvwmWinList; do ../docs/run_man2html.sh $i;done

This will need updating for new modules, of course.

I'll check out the 2.2 branch and rebuild this.

BTW, the worst part of man2html is that the manpage has to be installed
before it works.  This isn't a terribly big deal for me but it is annoying.

Hi!

I noticed that it is not mentioned that gmake (GNU make) is required
for building fvwm2.3 (current) on the web page:

http://www.fvwm.org/cvs.html

after './configure' it says 'make'... maybe it should be a note
about that gmake is needed? Or maybe not when I think about it, 
because autoconf and automake is needed and they rely upon gmake I guess.

well well, just a thought....

You must have missed this part?:

Before You Begin

To know what is going in with the source tree you should be reading mail on the Fvwm Workers List. See the Mailing List Info
page for more information. 

To build FVWM from the CVS sources, you must have several GNU tools: 

    the CVS client version 1.9 or better, 
    GCC, 
    GNU make,                               <============================
    autoconf, version 2.13 or better, and 
    automake, version 1.4 or better. 

Without these tools, you won't be able to build out of the CVS source tree. But don't despair: download one of the daily snapshots
instead!


For me, "gnumake", or "gmake" installs by default as "make".
(I admit, I don't like that, and I rename it "gnumake".)

I admit, I missed this part, sorry all!

On my system make is make and gmake is gnu make :-)

As with any properly constructed autoconf'd package, you can use the
various options --program-prefix, --program-suffix, or
--program-transform-name with configure to modify the installation names
of all installed binaries.

In your case, "configure --program-prefix=g" (or "--program-prefix=gnu")
should do the trick.

If that doesn't work, it's a bug; please let me know.

My FvwmWinList tends to creep off the window to the left.  I place it
so that it's right on the edge of the screen.  Then I look later and
it has moved left and is 1/4 the way off the screen.  I'm not sure
what makes it move.  Maybe when there are long titles that have to get
truncated.  I am supplying a min and max width.  Can anyone tell me
how to fix this?  My configuration is below:

*FvwmWinListBack #c0b0c0
*FvwmWinListFore Black
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1,Focus,Raise
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry +0-120
*FvwmWinListFocusBack yellow
*FvwmWinListMinWidth 120
*FvwmWinListMaxWidth 120

Oh yeah, that FvwmWinListFocusBack doesn't seem to work as advertised
either.  I don't see any yellow.

Thanks,
John

My mistake.  I'd previously had a 2.0 version of fvwm installed and
had a ModulePath line in my .fvwm2rc pointing to the old module
directories.  So when I thought I was running all 2.2 modules, I was
really running the old stuff.  I'm sure the problems will go away now.

Heh :)

Well, I'm not _SURE_ but there's a much better likelihood.

If you still see problems let us know.
