Hi all,

What's this diff format. I don't know it, and my patch program fail to make
patch on the source - i've the same pb with button pixmap patch.

Can you tell me what i'm doing wrong or where can i find a new patch program
which handle this diff format - oups, and how can i produce a diff in this
format. My box is a sun with solaris 2.4. (2.5 in few weeks).

Thank's at all.

Olivier

I joined the mailing list recently, so forgive me if this is a
common subject:

Is anybody else working on an utility to configure fvwm2? I have so
far seen the FvwmConfig module and the Dotfile generator, but both
seem to be rather limited in functionality.

This weekend, I started working on a Tk program 'fvwmconf' to see
how easy it would be to implement in this language. Now I'm sure
I'll be able handle virtually the complete .fvwmrc generation
with a nice, consistent GUI. The tool can already set the
general parameters like EdgeResistance, ModulePath or HighlightColor
(just like dotfile and FvwmConf) as well as the lists of Key and Mouse
bindings. The next task would be the Style definitions.

Before continuing this project, I'd like to know if other people
are working on this topic. If you like, I could send a snapshot
of the current pre-alpha (~ 22kB) to this list.

Regards, 

Henning

These are most likely unified diffs made with GNU diff.  You need the
GNU version of patch to handle these.  You can get it a
prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/patch-2.1.tar.gz .

I am using Fvwm 1.24.  Is it possible to use variables in the .fvwmrc file?  
I'd like to create some variables for colors, so I don't have to change the 
colors throughout the file.  Ex:

COLOR1=black
COLOR2=grey
COLOR3=grey75

HiForeColor     $COLOR1
HiBackColor     $COLOR3
PagerBackColor	$COLOR2
PagerForeColor  $COLOR1
*GoodStuffFore	$COLOR2
*GoodStuffBack	$COLOR2
 
Popup "Xterms"
   Exec "Xterm" exec xterm -bg $COLOR1 -fg #COLOR2
   Exec "Xterm" exec xterm -bg $COLOR2 -fg #COLOR1
EndPopup


What I really want, is to have several color sets.  Then I could switch 
between them.  Is there a "read" command for 1.24?

Popup "Fvwm Colors"
   Read .fvwm.colors.greys "Greys"
   Read .fvwm.colors.browns "Browns"
   Read .fvwm.colors.blues "Blues"
EndPopup
...

I remember seeing some info on this in the list, but I haven't been able to 
locate in the archive.  Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kevin

I don't think you can do this directly with fvwm, but you can
certainly do this with the m4 preprocessor (I do something
similar with HTML).

You have to read the man page to get the m4 preprocessor working, but
once you do, you might want to include a fvwm_config.m4 file or
the top of your fvwmrc file, where you might put something like:

define(COLOR1,black)
define(COLOR2,grey)
define(COLOR3,grey75)

...then it will replace all of the occurrences as necessary.  If you
append a dnl right after each line above it will also get rid of blank lines.

However, m4 also has other macros which do other things.  The best way
to configure this safely is to make your fvwmrc m4 file and m4 it
manually, i.e. "m4 <fvwmrcfile >tmpfile" then diff it with the
original to see if anything OTHER than the macros you have defined
have changed.  If so, you will probably need to use the quoting
mechanisms or undefine something (see below).

Once I wrote a small program to return a random command-line argument
so that I could backquote the return value; with this I could assign a
random color scheme to the desktop on every startup.  

M4 preprocessing gives you all kinds of neat power, you can run shell
commands and create some intricate macros (for instance, you might
have the date or the current user at the top of you menu with esyscmd
or something).

However, if you need to reference a macro word, such as include or
shift, you have to either undefine it or quote it (i.e. `shift').

Have fun,

If I remember correctly, that version of fvwm processed its rc file
through the m4 macro preprocessor.  You could use m4 to define those
colors and use thier symbols where needed.  Just change the
definitions to change the color of the display.  See m4(1) for more
details.

Restarting fvwm dumps core: 2.0.41 on AIX 4.1.4
It worked fine in 2.0.25.

If this is a novel bug I can supply more info. What is the easiest

I seem to recall a mention that FvwmTalk was being rewritten to
provide a better interface/functionality, but in the meantime, I've
been playing with the following FvwmForms that do the job pretty
nicely.  Maybe others could use this as well.  MyTalk is a one shot
deal, intended to be called from a menu, while MyFvwmTalk is designed
to hang around.  Pity there's no way to do inheritance for things like
this, though I could probably do something with m4.

I had originally intended to enhance FvwmTalk's capabilities, but then
Toshi Isogai mailed me a new module called FvwmConsole which is
implemented differently, but basically takes care of many of the
improvements that I wanted to make.

I intend on having it be in the next beta release, which will appear
as soon as I clean up a few more things.  Work and various other
things have obliterated my free time lately, so it's taking longer
than originally intended...

Hey, cool idea!  I'll include these in the updated sample rc file, if
you don't mind.

Quite possibly.

H.Peraza and I made a quick hack around fvwm2.
This way, we hope to free the fvwm TODO list from the MS-windowish
requests.
Here is the annoucement :


FVWM95 : a window manager based on fvwm, and revamped to look like the
         MS-one


What is FVWM-95 ?
-----------------

Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2.x. It tries to emulate the good features
of a well known product without bloating the regular fvwm code.

The main aspects are :

     A familiar look and feel. It can be interesting for users moving
     from the MS-World to Unix, or for those who have to switch
     regularly between the two. Or for those that simply would like to
     have the same MS look and feel in Unix, or for those that just want
     to have another window manager, or... But before all, it's meant to
     be usefull, simple and efficient;

     Same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm;

     Functionality extensible via loadable modules;

     A taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't take space
     with icon windows;

In the future, we plan to have a desktop/folder metaphor supported by
the window manager, as well as improve the current version.

PLEASE NOTE that fvwm-2.x is work in progress, so is fvwm95 too...


Where to get it ?
---------------
     You can ftp the latest version from: ftp://mitac11.uia.ac.be/pub .
     The new version is named: fvwm95-2.0.41b.tgz

Many thanks to all the Fvwm team, and to Mr. Rob Nation who started to
code a nice wm.

Hello
I recently downloaded and compiled fvwm2. I can run the window manager
but I have following problems:

1) I cant seem to be able to move, resize, or open (If application
started as iconify) windows.

2) I dont see FvwmBottons.

3) I dont see the desktop layout.

4) I cant switch to other desks.

I would appreciate someone helping on this.

You probably don't have a .fvwm2rc file.  Copy the included sample
system.fvwmrc to $HOME/.fvwm2rc and try it again.

Not to compare apples and oranges again but something that olvwm does well
is the Virtual Desktop and...

	(1) Can I get fvwm not to show sticky windows in the pager? I *know* where they are!
	(2) Can I ask fvwm not to show cerain windows or icons in the pager? Eg can I get it
to ignore popups associated with other apps? Running some astronomical stuff gives
me a very crowded pager when all I need to know is where my IRAF stuff is.

When I saw that Subject line, a horrified shudder ran down my
spine... :) As everyone has probably gathered from my previous posts,
I really hate WinXX (any version).

But, my officemate really likes Win95, so I grabbed it and he's trying
your hack right now.  Now that I've seen it, I feel like I can make
some comments.  The first one being, that it looks interesting.  I can
see why some people find that appearance visually pleasing.

Which is good, because I probably won't incorporate a lot of them.
But, some of them WILL be in the next beta release (out in the next
few days):

        - pixmaps for titlebar buttons
        - patch for better popups from modules (which would improve
          the Start button popup), and the patch for caching the menu
          xpms

I might be willing (if it's not too difficult and bloating) to add to
the foregound background specifiers to allow the titlebar to have a
different color scheme than the borders, which is the only other big
visual difference that I saw (I'm not counting the border style & menu
differences, as they seem pretty minor, so could probably be
overlooked).

Always a good goal, the latter.

The task bar module should work fine under fvwm2.x, although it might
require some small mods.

A module could be written to display Win95 style menus, and that'd
work out ok after I add the ability to send arbitrary strings to
modules like was discussed on this list last week (which I plan to do
soon).

David> In the future, we plan to have a desktop/folder metaphor supported by

I'm not exactly certain what is meant by that, but if you really wish
to make a specialized Win95 clone (perhaps because you don't think the
changes I'm making will let you get close enough to what you want just
via modules), you might want to do what bowman's author did and just
use fvwm code as a starting point, then make it a whole new
specialized window manager (I'd suggest renaming it if you do so
though) instead of trying to stay in sync w/ fvwm2, which will
probably be difficult.

While I don't want to bloat fvwm code, if I can make it so modules can
be used to get a different look and feel, I think that may be good,
and I'd probably be willing to include the modules in the distribution
(or at least a pointer to them in the FAQ & on the website).

The only problem being that the look might not be 'exact', but I bet
it could be real close.

David> PLEASE NOTE that fvwm-2.x is work in progress, so is fvwm95 too...

Which is why it may difficult for you to stay in sync, especially the
changes I have planned for after the first official release (The Great
Style Flags Rewrite, among other things).

If I can make this be possible via modules (as was discussed in the
past too), it would make your lives easier and give more potential to
fvwm.

I like this idea.  I downloaded fvwm95 and tested it out; I like the
taskbar.  OTOH, I also like the direction that fvwm is moving in and
don't think it's worth it to switch to another wm just for the taskbar.
Optional modules could be much better than having the wasted effort
of two wm's being written just because one has an extra bell or whistle
that the original doesn't.

Agreed.

Hi,

I'm trying to use xkeycaps at home to make it look like I'm typing on a
vt200 (I need the PF, Find, Do, etc. keys).  According to the
documentation, the "Type At Window" function allows me to select a
window which can receive keystrokes from the xkeycaps keyboard picture.
This is just what I need.

Xkeycaps says to remember to select "Allow SendEvents" from the Xterm
menu, which I did, but my selected xterm is not receiving any events.
Is this a problem with fvwm?  Anyone else having any success with this
feature of xkeycaps?  (I'm not trying to redo my xmodmap, just send
keystrokes to an xterm.)

I seem to be running fvwm 2.0pl33 at home.


thanks,
tw

Num Lock is a kind of key/mouse modifier. So if your config is something 
like,

   Mouse 1  R    N       Menu "Utilities" Nop

Mouse button 1 won't work when num-locked because it specified as no 
modifier.

Adding the next line will fix your problem

   Mouse 1  R    4       Menu "Utilities" Nop

Depending on your keyboard, it might be 3 instead of 4 for Num Lock key.
You can find it with xkeycaps.

That would be very nice too.

I found this package (fvwm95) very interesting, and I really hope I
will have pixmaps in my menus one day. However, I was unable to
configure fvwm95 to make my windows look like they did before so I
went back to vanilla fvwm. I hope it wont be necessary to make fvwm95
a window manager "on its own"! I'd be very happy if at least parts of
it would be available as add-ons to fvwm in the future, either as
Modules (TaskBar) or as configuration options (Pixmaps in the menus
and window title bars).

Thanks to both teams for this wonderful stuff anyway!

I'm trying to install version 2.0.41 of fvwm, and can't get anything to
compile. I have both imake and xmkmf on my system which is running Linux
Caldera 1.3.81 on a Pentium 100. When I try to run xmkmf I get:

mv - f Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
Imakefile.c:3: Imake.tmpl: No such file or directory
imake: Exit code 33. Stop.

If I try ./MakeMakefiles I get the above errors in every directory.
Since I'm very good about following directions I don't see what I'm
doing wrong. Any suggestions?

With the standard fvwm2 you can have also the pixmaps in the menus (the 
vvwm95 menu code is the same as in fvwm2). Just use the same syntax 
for the menu items in your .fvwm2rc

Yes, the win-95 look and feel in fvwm is hard-coded inside, you cannot
change it back to the standar look with any option. Actually, I started
the hack just as a hobby, because I like the win95 look (although I hate
windows.xx too, and more specifically I hate M$). Then when D.Barth
announced his taskbar I decided to put the whole package in my ftp, so
anybody who likes can use it. 

I didn't want to add the win-95 look and feel as an additional option to
fvwm, because that would increase the memory consumption. Take into
account that the border-drawing routines are different, there are changes
in the menu drawing routines and in the popup code, the title and buttons
placement routines also have changed, some internal structures changed to
make possible to have a different title color scheme than the border, a
new broadcast message was added, etc. Add all that together to the fvwm
code and you finish with... a monster. But all that can change if the idea
of having a module(s) responsible for the window's look and feel success,
as I hope. In that case you just will have to load the module you want,
and voila! 

About the new modules, the idea is to make them work also with the
standard fvwm, but with some of them you might require some patches to
fvwm, because they would need some new special funcion from fvwm.

Hector Peraza.

Strange : have you installed all the X stuff in your Caldera setup ?
Search fro the Imake.tmpl or grab a RedHat RPM 
(it should be a big XF86xx.rpm)

Having recently converted from 1.24r and gotten things to work nearly
the way I want them, I have some questions:

1. How does the execution of the lines of an AddToFunc depend on the
   success/failure of the preceding lines? The function below seems to
   do what I want, i. e.:

   -- If a window by that name exists, make sure it's not iconified
      and give it focus.

   -- If no such window exists, create one ($1 since the command to
      create a window may differ from its name once created), wait for
      it to appear and then give it the focus.

   AddToFunc Warp	I Next [$0] Iconify -1
   +			I Next [$0] Focus
   +			I None [$0] Exec detach $1
   +			I Wait $0
   +			I Next [$0] Focus

   No window gets created if one already exists, which is what I want,
   but I would like to know how this comes about. The man page doesn't
   seem to say anything about this.

2. The man page states that you can use $0-9. Is there any parallel
   to shell $* or $@, i. e. *all* the positional parameters?

3. When I invoke WindowList from the keyboard, as in

   Key o  A  3  WindowList 0 0

   it takes *two* keystrokes to jump to some window. It doesn't seem
   to matter whether the window's number is the first, last or both of
   these. If I key in two different numbers, the last one takes
   precedence.

   When I invoke WindowList with the mouse, one keystroke is enough.

   If this isn't the way things are supposed to work, tell me and I'll
   send a proper bug report. If it is, please tell me some way to work
   around it; it's annoying!

Last, but definitely not least, thank you to those who've made Fvwm avai=
lable!

file...I have gnu c v2.5.8.

I am getting the following build errors...any hints?

Hello out there!

	I am trying to install the latest version of FVWM (version
2.xx) at our institute here in Oslo. I am having great problems with
the color Icons - I can't "HasXpm"!
1.	I have installed XpmLibs as instructed in Fvwm.tmpl.
2.	I can compile the window manager without problems
3.	When I try to run it I get 
4.	7546: /mn/vega/u1/bards/bin/fvwm2: /sbin/loader: Fatal Error: cannot map libXpm.so
5.	No more is hear from fvwm2

	Does this imply that the X11R5/lib file libXpm.so is not usable and
that such a file from X11R6/lib is needed?? If so where can I get
these files? Worse, does this mean that there is something wrong with
my loader?

	Sorry that I cannot be more specific but I am a bit puzzled :|

Cheerio just now, 

			Bard

This is an error from the dynamic loader on your system.  In other words,
it's an OS problem, not an FVWM problem.  Since you don't say what OS
you're using it's kind of difficult to tell you anything more.

You might try making sure that libXpm is in the path searched by the loader
($LD_LIBRARY_PATH on some systems) and that the link cache is up to date if
it's required on your system.

Yes, the loader is having a problem trying to find libXpm.so.  It may compile
fine, but that is probably because you compiled with the 
option, "-L/path/to/libXpm.so".  This is fine for compiling, but when fvwm
is executed, the loader doesn't know where to look anymore.

As mentioned before, you can fix this by setting the environment variable,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location of the file, -or-, and better yet, you can
send a flag to the loader to create a path record in the executable so it
knows where to look.  On the system I am on (Digital Unix), that flag is
-rpath <path>, on others it may be different.  If you think multiple people
might be using the fvwm that you compile, this would be a better fix, that
way everybody who uses it doesn't have to set their LD_LIBRARY_PATH's.

And a word of warning to everybody on Digital Unix.  It appears that vendor
supplied loader does not allow for a space between -rpath and its argument.
Also, there is no compiler option to send a flag to the loader.  Thus, the
compiler cannot handle the space, and thinks the argument to -rpath an object
file.  As of yet, I haven't found a good workaround, other than to change
Makefiles so that the loader is called separately, or to make until it breaks,
run the load line by hand, and make again.  If anybody knows of a solution to
this, I would be more than happy to know it.

Hi,
I've just built fvwm2 (2.0.41) on SunOS 4.1.4 (MIT X11R5). No
problems in compile & link, but when I started it it
locked. When I copied the sample system.fvwmrc to ~/.fvwm2rc,
everything works. IMHO, this is a bug :-(

Hi,
I've just started using fvwm2 and so far, it has the same
functionality as fvwm 1.x, but one thing bugs me - I can't get the 
icons to be placed on the bottom, left to right.

In my fvwm file (.fvwmrc) I have this, which works:

  IconBox   5 -64 -140 -5

So I put this in my .fvwm2rc:

   Style "*"  DecorateTransient,IconBox 5 -64 -140 -5

But I still get the icons in the top left in one desktop and on the
top right on another. Is fvwm2 trying to avoid plaing the icons on
any window? If so, can this behavior be overridden?

Thanks

Hi there,


I'd definately like SOME feedback about those ideas. How do others think about
them? Are there already people at work implementing at least some of those
ideas?

If I somehow find enough time, then I'll start with work on the Smartplacement
things myself - but that will definately take a while... [I've to do lots of
overhours at the moment].


FVWM bugs?

 * From time to time when a window closes the mouse cursor becomes round
   shaped and I need to press a mouse button to transfrom the cursor back
   to normal and to become able to continue to work.
	Happens on	Linux 1.2.13, 1.3.70, 1.3.81  (all ELF)
			+ XFree 3.1.2

	and on		AIX 4.1.1

	with		fvwm2.0.40 & 2.0.41


 * When I use maximize on AIX from time to time the window-to-be-maximzed
   at first does so but then immediately kills the whole application...
   (happens with different applications, most of which ought to be able
    to cope with that resizing, i.e. Netscape, xterm, ...)
   Oh - this bug only occurs if Maximize should only maximze one dimension
   (Maximize vertical -- 'Maximize 0 100')...

 * Bug or change in a feature. In fvwm1 if I have autoraise enabled and 
   enter AND leave a window beofre auto-raise tkaes effect, then the window
   where I moved through kep focus (SloppyFocus), but it was not raised, 
   since I already left the window. fvwm2 raises the window anyway if it
   doesn't lose it's focus before auto-raise comes into effect.
   (Personally I'd like the old way much better, but if other people think
    of that differently, at least make that configurable!)


FVWM Wishlist:

 * Improve Smartplacement (I have several ideas for possible improvements):

   - if there is not enough room to place a window somewhere where it doesn't
     obstruct anything, then at least use as much free space for the new 
     window as possible and only partly (as little as possible) overlap with
     other windows.

   - I'd like a configuration option that allows for certain windows to be
     ignored with regards to Smartplacement (I do not mean that those should
     not be Smartplaced, but rather that the Smartplacing algorithm ignores
     the presence of those windows while finding free space on the desktop).
     For instance, I'd like the pager to be left out - the pager is pretty
     small and on the top right of the screen (the only window automatically
     placed there), and since it is pretty small and configured StaysOnTop,
     I'd like that window's presence to be ignored with the Smartplacement
     as it will not pose a serious problem there, as it will only overlap 
     the Maximize/Iconify buttons in the window border...

   - I'd like to have Smartplacement look for various places on the screen
     and find the best one out of those (it occured several times that the
     Smartplacement placed a window in a way that it cut the available free 
     space virtually in half, where it would have been possible to place 
     the window in a way, so that it only left one huge block of free space
     on the desktop rather than two smaller ones...

   - I'd need to really try it, but at least I'd like to see Smartplacement
     also taking into account free space on other virtual screens, so that
     it it doesn't have enough space on one screen, that it just places the
     window on another one that has enough space left. I think this could 
     also be nuisant that if for instance netscape opens a popup box, then
     that one ought to stay on the same screen rather than to switch to 
     another one, so this suggestion is mainly directed at new applications
     opening their first window.

   - (this also goes for Randomplacement) Would it be possible to mark an
     area of the screen that is automatically left out for window placement
     as long as possible (as long as possible means, that this area will 
     of course be used if a window is maximized or a window is too big
     to fit on the rest of the screen). This would mainly be interesting 
     to keep the IconBox free...


 * I'd like to give different configurations for edge resistance, i.e. I
   like an easy movement over to other screens, but then the edge resistance
   is far too little when it comes to resizing a window, which I want to
   resize so that it just goes to the screen border - if I don't do that 
   quickly enough the pointer will then immdiately flip over to the
   neighbouring screen.

 * Keep track of window focussing on the different screens (maybe even the
   mouse pointer position if I leave/enter a screen with a key-combination
   instead of moving the mouse out of the screen area.



Otherwise, keep up the good work and apart from that auto-raise change I like
fvwm2 a great deal better than fvwm1...


yours,
	Benedikt

I'm one of the last people in the world that wants to see fvwm get much
bigger, but I did think of a feature that I wish fvwm had.

I would like to see some sort of WarpToTransient (sp) Style flag of some
kind that would automatically warp the mouse pointer to the center (or
some offset) of a Transient window.

This would make text searches in some applications much friendlier
because I wouldn't be forced to move my mouse.

Of course, I don't think I would want this in every application.  That's
why it would make for a nice style flag.

Any thoughts?

-Alan

I've been trying to compile fvwm 2.0.41 under hp-ux this afternoon, and
have had nothing but problems. I have access to a X11R5 and Imake and all,
but the systemwide Imake.tmpl sets HasGcc to no, and uses cc +0 instead of
gcc -O (even though WAY more people only have gcc instead of cc at our site).

After wading through Imakefiles/Makefiles all afternoon, I started fresh
and added the following lines to Fvwm.tmpl, hopeing to override ALL
CC and CFLAGS with these: 
#define FvwmOptions -O1
#define FvwmCompiler gcc
and further down:
#ifdef FvwmOptions
        CFLAGS = FvwmOptions
#endif

When I run xmkmf, MakeMakefiles, and make, I get a mixed bag. Some files 
compile properly, others don't. 
#1: Works in this case, and when I set FvwmOptions to have -L and -I flags
gcc -O1   -c CatString3.c -o CatString3.o
#2: Fails unless I set -L and -I
gcc -O1   -c GetFont.c -o GetFont.o
#3: Also fails, but works if I set FvwmOptions to have -L and -I flags
gcc -c -O1 -DFVWM_ICONDIR=\"/usr/include/X11R5/X11/bitmaps\:/usr/include/X11R5/X11/pixmaps\" -DFVWMDIR=\"/usr/lib/X11R5/X11/fvwm2\" -DFVWMRC=\".fvwm2rc\" builtins.c
#3: Fails either way because it has the +O1, set by (I think) CDEBUGFLAGS,
    BUT it has the libraries and include files
gcc -o FvwmAudio FvwmAudio.o +O1   -L/usr/lib/X11R5 -L/usr/lib/Motif1.2 -L/bnr/contrib/X11R5/lib/1 -L/usr/lib/X11R5 -L../../libs -lfvwm2 -L/bnr/contrib/lib/1 -lXpm -lV3  -lXext  -lX11   

I don't mind the fact that I had to hack around to get this figured out,
but unless I'm being really stupid about something, there is no easy 
DOCUMENTED way to set things like the compiler and cflags in one place,
and editing _24_ Imakefile_s is not really something I want to do.

Am I missing something obvious?!?

is there a way to define multiple iconboxes with fvwm2??  i would like for the
icons to 1st line up on the bottom of the screen & then the right hand side of
the screen.  i have the following lines in my .fvwm2rc file.

Style "*" IconBox -25 1 -1 -1
Style "*" IconBox 5 -70 -140 -5

You must associate the iconbox with some icons.  Your second line simply
overrides the first.  E.g., I have two icon boxes, one across the lower
part of the screen, for xterms, and the rest go across the top of the
screen.  I think these are the only two lines that matter:

========================================================================
Style "*"           DecorateTransient,IconBox 0 0 -1 70
Style "XTerm"       IconBox 0 -70 -1 -1
========================================================================

Since the Xterm line comes second, it has precedence.

I think what he might want are two iconboxes; when one fills, use the
other.

Although I never used the feature, I believe in Fvwm 1.2 you could
specify multiple iconboxes; they'd get used in their specified order
as the regions filled up.  I'm not sure if it works that way in Fvwm
2.0, though.

If it does, then the specification is an issue: if they're on
different lines, do they override or augment?  If they're on the same
line, they ought to augment.

Configuring the compiler and flags is supposed to part of the imake
configuration on your system, not part of fvwm. In fact, that is the
whole point of the imake scheme, that the application does *not* need to
specify system-dependent things.

The `correct' place to specify compiler and flags is in the site.def
file in the imake configuration directory. Set this up once, and then
all you have to do for any X application is `xmkmf; make; make install
install.man'.  [Well in theory, at least ;)].

Is there an UNINSTALL program for linux like in MSWindows? I
installed FVWM2, and to be honest I like FVWM1.2.
I am tired of trying to understand it's configuration file. The extensibility
offered by FVWM1.2 is sufficient for my needs. I want to uninstall
the FVWM2 files and install the FVWM1.2 files back. Any ideas or
suggestions?

Thank you in advance.

Hello?

Anyone here? Its all gone quiet(ish).

Seriously, what happened to the promised flurry of activity on 
pushing out the next fvwm2 beta? I seem to have been waiting for
bated breath for a week or two now, unless of course our mail went
non-linear again. If I have missed a batch or two or mail I'm
sorry.

So, Chuck, did things go 'Horribly Wrong (tm)'? And is Jarl still
about or have the men in green dragged him away yet? And if he is
here have you/are you working on/can you do proper rotated text for
the titlebar-down patch before you leave? (I don't want it but another
couple of fvwm users here love it.)

While I'm talking about new releases is there any sign of progress on
that popular wish list feature which I am also awaiting - StartsOnPage?

Dear all,

I have a .xsession file which starts a number of clients.  I would
like the client Netscape, for example, to start on desk "WWW".  I know
that I could add "StartsOnDesk WWW" to the Netscape style, but that
means that Fvwm (2.0.41) switches to that desk permanently so that
subsequent clients will appear on that desk as well.

Using Ctwm, I was able to add something like StartsOnDesk to the rc
file and it didn't really switch desks, it just put the newly
appearing client there.

I would be happy with a function that I call from a menu that selects
the next (also the only) Netscape window and moves it to another desk.

I'll be grateful for any and all ideas you might have,
kai

It has been real quiet, actually, unless I'm missing mail too.

DK> So, Chuck, did things go 'Horribly Wrong (tm)'?

Actually, yes.  Which is why things have been delayed.  I had a list
of about 30 items that I was trying to get into this next release, and
I have about 15 of them done and a few partially done.  They all would
have been ready, but I was hit with a coredump that resulted from
trying to merge in too many patches at once (all of which had to be
done by hand).  I just figured out the problem this past Wednesday.

So, I think I'm going to release it later today (provided my final
tests go ok) minus the stuff I didn't finish, since it's taken much
longer than anticipated.  I'll just move those others into the next
beta release.

Nope.  That one won't happen until after the first official release
and the infamous Great Style Flag Rewrite.

And speaking of the first official release, that's going to happen
soon.  Probably after 2 more betas (this next one, and one more to
finish up what I didn't finish for this one).  It's been put off for
far too long.

	Right.. my problem is that whoever set things up on my system 
should be executed for being a moron. I still think that my point was
valid, however, because some of the modules were compiled with CFLAGS,
some with CDEBUGFLAGS, some had FVWMLIBS included, some only included
LIBS, and so on..
	At any rate, I took 2.0.41 home and compiled it under Ultrix
and it worked PERFECTLY. Much improved from older versions-- I had to
change two lines (paths to xpm stuff) and then the rest was automatic.
	One small problem I did notice with the fvwm_convert script in
the utils directory: under Ultrix, it needed to run /bin/sh5, and there
is no /dev/stderr, so I changed those lines to /dev/console. I think it
might be nice to stick some comments in the header of the script to that
effect.
	And finally, I've gone through the sample .fvwm2rc file, changed
it to my liking, reorganized all of the various options into sections, 
and commented almost everything. This is for friends who can't be bothered
to read documentation, but it might be a useful replacement for the
system.fvwmrc. Shall I send it to the list or upload it somewhere?

Will this add functionality or simply reimplement the present
features???

One of our sysadmins can't tear himself from tvtwm because of it's
ability to assign window border, icon and menu entry colors on a
per-menu-item basis.

The other feature he's after is tvtwm's dynamic menus...

I did this locally for 1.xx for similiar reasons, and I was planning
to do this myself for this next release (or the one after) so I'd like
to see it.  I could definitely use it as a starting point, if not
verbaitim.  Please mail it to me.

Thanks,

Hi everybody,

thanks to Chuck, my problem is solved.  I'm getting to like Fvwm even
better (is that possible?) now.  The solution is to use SkipMapping
which does exactly what I want: when a window is mapped that
StartsOnDesk somewhere, the current desk isn't changed any longer.

Please excuse me for not explaining my problem clearly enough.
Several people responded with the suggestion of placing useful Wait
(or something) statements in the InitFunction.  I didn't want to use
InitFunction, though, because I'd like to have the same clients
started no matter which window manager I use.  (Is contemplating using
something else Blasphemy?;-)

I'm assured that SkipMapping will actually be documented in a future
release.  The current (2.0.41) release of the man page sez that it's
there but not what it does.

Per se, it won't add anything new, but it is the base needed to
implement more per-window stuff.  For example, it is currently
impossible to specify per-window autoraise (FvwmAuto{,Raise} is an
all-or-nothing kind of thing); after TGSFR it will be rather easy to
add, I gather.

  Michael> One of our sysadmins can't tear himself from tvtwm because

He's got a menu where the first item is blue and the second is red?
Well... de gustibus non disputandem.

  Michael> The other feature he's after is tvtwm's dynamic menus...

What are dynamic menus?  Haven't used tvtwm in a couple of years now,
but I don't see why one shouldn't be able to do useful stuff with
functions.

With Fvwm you can put menu definitions in a file, then read that file
at run time to have these take effect.  So, you write a shell script
that does:

    echo AddToMenu Bla \"Item\" Exec xterm >> ~/.fvwm/foo-menu

And you can do

    Read ~/.fvwm/foo-menu

from a menu or a keybinding.  This seems to be Turing-complete.  Can
tvtwm do better than this?

"He" says that tvtwm does a fstat() on a 'menu file', and if it has
changed, the new version is read without the need to push a button. I
must admit it is more elegant....

How about this:

######################################################################
Mouse 2 R MC DynamicMenu

AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title

AddToFunc DynamicMenu "I" DestroyMenu "DMenu"
+ "I" Read .fvwm2rc-dynmenu

######################################################################

It reads the file every time, regardless of whether it changed or not,
but it accomplishes basically the same thing.

In addition to the StartsOnDesk style, use the SkipMapping style and,
if you've got a pager going you'll see the tiny window appear but you
dont' get switched to it.

Example from my .fvwm2rc:

Style "Netscape" StartsOnDesk 2, SkipMapping

Skipmapping (and it's inverse Showmapping) have been around a long
time, but I think it only made it to the man page recently but the man
page doesn't really describe it.

May I suggest an addition to the man page (under the Style section):

  SkipMapping causes new windows that do not start on the current desk
  (by way of a StartsOnDesk or "-xrm *Desk: foo" directive) to not be
  mapped until that desk is visited.  This prevents switching to that
  desk when the window is opened.  If SkipMapping is set as a default
  then ShowMapping can turn it off for specific windows.

To avoid always re-reading a menu file, one could consider a new
module doing exactly what Michael wants. This module would look at
some menu files (specified by the user) once in a while and send a
Read-command to FVWM when they have changed. This approach would be
quite FVWM-ish too!

Actually, fvwm2 will let  you get a  similar effect in the popup menus
by using  mini-pixmaps  in the menus.    Just vary the   colors of the
pixmaps.

Well, conisdering the flurry of activity on the list today, I just 
thought I'd put in my 0.02$ worth. 

As some of you may know, a version of XFree86 has been released for 
OS/2. The code is considered ALPHA, but has in fact proven to be 
quite stable. It can be found at the usual XFree ftp site and 
at its mirrors. You can also check out
http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html
for the latest info and list of bugs, ports of X apps to OS/2 etc.

I did some porting work on fvwm2, the main problem was getting the 
pipe connection to modules to work. The more interesting modules
work, and fvwm2 seems to work quite well. Hopefully I can clean up
the patches and send them to Chuck for inclusion in the standard
distribution. 

You can find fvwm2 at:
http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~s521936/xf86ports.html

The feedback I have received has been very positive. Again, congrads on a 
great window manager!



Below is the original announcement I made on the XFreeOS2 mailing list:

________________________________________________________________


Version 2.0.41 of the fvwm window manager is now available. This new
version includes support for modules, and includes a few of the more
interesting modules, such as:

FvwmPager: virtual workspaces and virtual screen support.
FvwmButtons: Button bars, can also "swallow" other windows.
FvwmTalk: provides interactive interface to fvwm

and a few other modules. Note that with the above modules, the
customization options are nearly endless..... 

It is available at the following address:

http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~s521936/xf86ports.html


A few notes on this release:

- The XPM library is REQUIRED. Check out Holger Veit's page to get it.

 
- The fvwm version 2 code is still somewhat in flux (fvwm2 is still
beta). Expect updates to fvwm, especially for the modules. 

- Following the convention set by the fvwm developpers, the new
version is called "fvwm2.exe" to avoid any name clash with the old
version. Note also that the configuration file is called ".fvwm2rc"
and is located in /xfree86/lib/X11/fvwm2
You should look through this and customize to your taste. 

- The archive includes a collection of pixmaps.

Both - It will reimplement in order to be able to add more

Yes, I've tried that and found that I really didn't like it.  Why?  It's
too bloody slow (at least on my system).  Instead of popping the menu
instantaneously, it'd take a second or two.  Not my idea of fun,
especially when I'm working.  Oh, but I have another solution.  This one
isn't as elegant (or maybe it is), but I've run across something that
might be a potential bug.

I wanted "dynamic" menus as well because I tend to stay logged into X a
lot.  When I want to add a new entry (usually an application), I had to
restart when all I really wanted to do is reread the menu.  Rereading the
menus every time like Chuck's example defeats the purpose for me because I
don't make that many changes to my menu.

Well, by using DestroyMenu and Read, I'm able to reread all the menus when
I want to.  Yes, one has to destroy them all to reread them.  And herein
lies the problem.  Here's my function:

  AddToFunc ReadMenus "I" DestroyMenu Applications
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Commands
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Games
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Modules
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Remote-Logins
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Shells
  +    "I" DestroyMenu Utilities
  +    "I" Read .menu-applications
  +    "I" Read .menu-commands
  +    "I" Read .menu-games
  +    "I" Read .menu-modules
  +    "I" Read .menu-remotelogins
  +    "I" Read .menu-shells
  +    "I" Read .menu-utilities

(each .menu-* is a AddToMenu); and I've added:

  +       "Reread Menus"          ReadMenus

in menu binding.  Then, when I've made a change, I can just select "Reread
Menus" and FVWM dutifully rereads the menu set.  This isn't the problem
(it works wonderfully & quick, too).  The problem is that if I try to
reread the menus and I've changed *nothing* in them, FVWM takes down the
entire X session.  So ... if anything has been changed in any of those
menu files, I'm okay.  If I accidently reread and nothing has been
changed....  well, i'm outta luck.

Is this supposed to happen, or did I just find an elusive bug?  FWIW, I'm
running Linux 1.2.13 & the latest beta of FVWM...

Is it possible to have a click (button press) command associated with
a button that has swallow something?  (no, I really mean this :)

What I would like to do is swallow xload, then if I click on it have
it display an xterm with top running in it.  It does not look possible
from reading the man pages, but I figure I could have missed
something.

I'm running fvwm (.fvwm2rc resource file) on our SGIs and noticed that
we are unable to resize GL windows -- although everything seems to 
work (moving, iconifying, etc. appear to work just fine).

Any suggestions on what is going wrong and how to fix it?

OpenGL apps doesn't have this problem.  I suspect it's the GL window
management stuff that makes the hints to these sorts of windows 
unknown to fvwm (??).

thanks

Ted

it "sticks" to my mouse cursor, and i need to click again to "unstick"
it.  i find this as frustrating as if i had glue on my fingers and
sometimes pieces of paper would stick to my fingers when i moved them

Yes, I think it is a known bug, and the principal one of the current 
release. Is a timing problem, I think (well, so I interpreted Chuck 
answers to the problem, and the mention to it in TO-DO file, where 
noticing the way Click vs DoubleClick vs Motion is calculated). Is there 
anything going on on it? Well, I noticed that the problem is worst when
machine is quite loaded, so it could be that someone using a HP PA risc 
with 64Mbyte of ram never notice it. But here, with a little 486/66, 16M 
of ram, is really a problem. And if I remember well, fvwm1.24 did _not_ 
have it. 

And more. It is related with the other bugs that make cursor transform on 
dot and being "blocked" until a click, especially when using titlebar 
menus and whe transient windows popping up? 

is this one of the 15 out 30 things added ti the new beta release :-))? 

Keep on the good work,
			Romano.

PS: I really like fvwm2. I think this bug (or these two, if they are 
distinct) are the only thing that need to be worked out before the 
public release.

Does anybody know of a way to limit how far you can go with the function
Desk 1 1 ?  Currently, it will go to the number of desks limit, which is very
high, and I was wondering if that number could be limited in some fashion...

First of all, I made a mistake in my last mail when I used "Desk 1 1". 
In fact, it meant to be "Desk 1".

And secondly, are there any documents or man pages that display a list of
conditions that are used by the various fvwm functions?  I wanted to know
exactly what conditions I could check for using the Next and Prev functions.

Hi all!

I'm afraid this is again one of those `It's great but I'd like to have
added....' comments. Apologies :-) But maybe I just didn't notice something in
TFM.

Is there a way to specify window positions in .fvwm2rc? I have one or two
programs which I'd like to fire up at login, but they don't accept the usual
toolkit options like -geometry (and they don't have anything similar).  So I
need something like

Style  "fooprog"  WindowPosition +20+20

If this is not possible, can it be implemented easily?

Bye,
Georg.

PS: BTW, fvwm2 is just MAGNIFICENT!!!!!! 8=)

Fvwm1 allowed multiple icon boxes: when one filled, then next was
used.

This feature was taken out of fvwm2.

I find it a great loss: what was the reason for removing the feature?

Hel(p)lo,

I just compiled and installed fvwm2 and can not seem to get the thing to
work. I did MakeMakefiles ; make ; make install ; make install.man and
then make a xinit.fvwm2 file and made it so the command startx would
startx w. fvwm2. All I get though is the blue screen. Am I not doing
somthing? I have Slackware 3.0 and so forth. w 12MB ram.....

Can anyonw help? I have tried the fvwmrc file it came with, putting my old
ones in there and still not luck............

Lately, one suggestion was made to make menus reload when modified. The 
solution to reload it everytime was simple but effectivly a little bit 
annoying (I guess because all icons are reload). Well, on my DX/2 with 
16m ram, it works fine. Anyway, I have investigated the possibility to 
make this smarter, using the functionnality already available in fvwm2.

I must say the fvwm has a very nice look. I have recently introduce it to 
few new coworker with no experience in Unix and X (All new programmer at 
the office get a linux powered X terminal, yeh!). Most new user don't 
need much to play with fvwm configuration, except at least adding items 
to menus.

I have toyed with the idea above and came with this little setup.

-I have one file per menus
-Menus can be assembled on the fly using directory content.
-Menu file can be inherited from a system directory or override locally 
 by the user. Overriding the complete .fvwmrc setup is not fun.

Here is my button bar configuration. The key to it is the fixmenu 
function. Not also that I place all fvwm2 configuration into a 
subdirectory .fvwmdir. For readability, I have skip some configuration 
line which are irrelevant here.

When poping a menu, I am calling the reread script which decide if the 
menus must be reload or not. It produces a file .fvwmdir/tmp/menus.temp 
and that file is always Read.

I am pretty happy about the result, except for one thing that I don't 
understand. There is something weird in the function "fixmenu". Mostly 
the first time I click on the modified menu, the old version shows up. It 
only appears right the second time. It looks like all three line are 
executed at once. I guess it is a side effect of the Exec command.

I am looking forward to install such a scheme at the office, as it will 
eliminate one things which make user unconfortable (doing a reload of 
fvwm to activate a single menu change).

Comment are welcome!

I'm maintaining the tkfvwm extension, which allows tcl/tk fvwm
modules.  It would be way easier for people to compile it if they had
libfvwm.a on their systems from having installed fvwm2.  It's such a
little bitty file; can we make the default to install it?

Thanks,

Hello,

	I was using fvwm 1.2x for quite a while with the XF86 series 
server, then I have switched to the AccelX server from X-Inside and 
everything still worked ok. But ever since I compiled fvwm2, it wouldn't 
start. It'll process the xinit stuff all the way to the point, where is 
a line "fvwm2" (used to be "fvwm") and there it'll simply stop.
Since I have installed fvwm2 I have to run it thrugh Xterm on startup, 
which is not very elegant. (it works fine with XF86 server). 
	This is totaly wierd to me. Either fvwm is using some non 
standard calls or AccelX doesn't fully conform to the X standard (that's 
the only possibilities I can thik of). Is this just problem on my 
computer or has anybode else experienced this ??

My system is pretty standard: P5/75, Assus MB, 16MB RAM, 
TsengET4000/W32p based video, no non-standerd components.

Any suggestions ?

	Thank you, Martin

hullo all,

I have a single 3x2 desktop (I don't like many desktops, since I
can't just cross the borders with the mouse).
I frequently work on more than one host (different accounts on
different hosts).

I end up starting e.g emacs on java.vlsivie, wait for the mapping and
then continue to work on vta_host.auto, while emacs initializes itself.

Or I read News with emacs on java, stumble over an url, have emacs
open netscape for me. When netscape is mapped, I move it to the next
page.

I'd very much like to have this done by fvwm.
One would use StartsOnDesk/Page and SkipMapping in the styles.

I could even specify that the "emacs@java.vlsivie" would 
"StartOnPage 1" (emacs sets the title in a clever way on startup).

But how do I specify, that all emacses from any host in vlsivie
StartOnPage 1 in the lower row of pages and all netscapes from that
domain on Page 2, while I use the upper row of pages for my primary
account ?

I suspect sth like 
	style "emacs@*.auto" StartsOnPage 1, Skipmapping
	style "emacs@*.vlsivie" StartsOnPage 3, Skipmapping
	style "netscape@*.vlsivie" StartsOnPage 4, Skipmapping
might be the right direction, when StartsOnPage is up & working.

But: netscape & others don't set it's title to 'argv[0]@host.domain' on
startup. (only emacs seems to do this.)

So it would be great to have fvwm2 handle this.
Does fvwm know the host of the connecting client? Or is this info only
present in the X server?

If fvwm knows the address, it could automatically split off the
@host.domain part of the style string and use it for matching.

The other possibility is to add a  -T $0@`hostname` wrapper to all
commands at the shell level, rendering the builtin titles useless.

Am I on the right way?
Any comments?

Subject: FVWM: Focus problems 
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.92

I'm not sure whether this is a problem with my .fvwm2rc file, or with
fvwm2 (.0.41), and I don't remember seeing it mentioned on the list.
Anyhow, upon startup I have an xterm open, and it comes up underneath
the mouse. However, it doesn't get Focus until I move the mouse out of
the window and back in. Focus follows the mouse, SloppyFocus is on.

I was able to work around this by putting a Next[!iconic xterm] Focus
line in the init and restart functions, but then the cursor is in the
corner of the screen. So then I added a CursorMove to get it in the
middle of the xterm. 

The problem with these workarounds is that they are slow. Everything comes
up, I'll start to move the mouse around, and then Focus/CursorMove hits.

This brings me to a couple of questions: 
1) Why does Focus move the mouse to the top-left corner of the window? It
   looks like it is finding the window and then generating a fake mouse
   click to Raise the window. Could Focus be made to ignore the mouse?
2) If not, how about new command pair: SaveMousePosition and
   RestoreMousePosition. I agree that it seems silly to add those for a
   single problem, but I could see it being used in other places. Like 
   buttons that warp you to other desktops, and a "Back" button that 
   returns you to where you were, ala pushdir/popdir.
3) Or, as an alternative, how about saving the cursor position with the
   window history. That way Next[] and Prev[] will have access to it, and
   users can choose to restore the cursor position.
4) While I'm thinking about it, when we get more Style flags, how about a
   StaysOnBottom? My xsession always starts last, so I have to explicitly
   lower it. I'd rather not add a Next[xsession] Lower that will slow down
   the startup even further.

That's what resource names are for.  You can start
    emacs -name bla
and Fvwm will recognize it under the name of bla (amongst others).

Let's just hope that Netscape obeys the rules and recognizes this
command line option, too.

There's a patch (by Henrique Martins <martins@martins.hpl.hp.com>)
that allows additional arguments to the Focus command:

    Focus   0   0 == old behavior (default if no numbers given)
    Focus  50  50 == middle of window
    Focus 100 100 == lower right hand corner
    Focus   0 100 == lower left hand corner (I think)

I don't know if Chuck has/will put it in 2.0.42.

:-)

I don't think all X software will recognize this one (though it SHOULD).

And I don't like the idea of mangling the class name:
who knows what is depending from that info.

and they're both still emacses of the class 'Emacs', so why name one emacs
'vi' on one domain ?

also it's a kind of pain to alias ALL X commands on one host to have -name
sth-else and then duplicate all style commands in .fvwm2rc on order to add
StartsOnPage.

I don't know what commands I'll start on that host, but I want EACH to show
up on my lowest left page, and netscapes on the left but one page.


so in fact I'd like to use sth like
	style "*@*.auto" StartsOnPage X
	style "*@*.vlsivie" StartsOnPage Y

and still have other style options under their normal names, since all
matching options are ORed together.

cheers,
albrecht

You're not mangling the CLASS, you're mangling the NAME.  By default,
X uses the name of the excutable as NAME.  Thus, try cp xterm bla,
then call bla and you'll see that it's still got XTerm as class but
now bla as name.

You could use the same NAME for all of them so that you only have one
entry in .fvwm2rc.

I admit that this is less than perfect.

ok, class, name, title these are the options for quick & dirty hacks.
As soon as StartsOnPage is working I was planning to do sth like this

Well I just wanted to put in my 2 Groschen, as the StartsOnPage style is
still to be implemented, and also before TGSFR.

So maybe it could be held in mind that someone might want to specify flags
upon WHERE the client connected from while hacking the style thingie.

That alone could change A LOT ;^)


It's some sort of having two -or many- different X Terminals connected to
different hosts, knowing that an emacs on "X terminal 1" is from host1, but
still being able to move windows from one 'X terminal' to the other, since
it's the same virtual desktop (for StartsOnPage) / X server (for
StartsOnDesk)  on the machine in front of you. 

most things can be made better with some hacking, but proper designing /
programming is far better in the long run.

I wouldn't have posted, if I thought I was the only one with X applications
from two hosts mixing....

(You always have to bear in mind, WHERE the application/ host ist, when
pressing the PRINT button.)

This is untested, but perhaps a function like this:

AddToFunc position_at_start "I" Exec $1
+ "I" Wait $2
+ "I" Next [$2] Focus
+ "I" Move $3 $4

would do the trick?

The usage would be such that $1 is the command to run, $2 the window
name of that application and $3 and $4 the x and y positions (probably
want to use the "p" suffix for pixels rather than percentage).

Hi folks, I've noticed a strange behaviour while hacking Java under FVWM 
that I was wondering if anyone else here has also experienced.

Specifically, I am writing an application using the AWT dialog boxes, and
whenever I open up a dialog box, I don't seem to be able to get labels to
come up reliably when I have more than one panel in the dialog. Labels do
appear, but only randomly.. or after I refresh the screen. Interestingly,
twm also seems to have this problem, but neither mwm or 4Dwm does.  As a 
result of this seemingly random behaviour, I haven't decided if it's a 
bug in Java or FVWM and related window managers.

Needless to say, I've noticed this problem on a SPARC and SGI machine as 
well as my Linux box.. so it's unlikely to be a platform specific problem.

Thanks for any pointers.

Hi All,

up till now I've only noticed problems when starting Xterm from a
window manager (in my case fvwm2.041) - now I've just installed
ImageMagick - and I can start it from any command prompt (although I
do have a script which sets the LIBPATH so that it can find
libMagick.a - which I can't write to /usr/lib or /lib) - anyway, it
all works fine from the CLI - but when I try to start it from the
window manager - nothing happens.

I've checked that the window manager has the right path (I've even put
in the full path name) and there's no typo's, because I have cut the
command from the .fvwm file and pasted it to my command line, and it
worked just fine.

Is there a logical reason why starting applications from the window
manager seems to be different than starting them from the command
line? Can someone explain it in a way which might lead to a solution
for this problem?

Thanks in advance,

Steve

The problem comes from a difference in the environnement seen by the fvwm 
process and all child. Quite often we execute xterm with the -ls option, 
forcing a read of .profile (or whatever your shell is using).

I have experienced difference between using "startx" on Linux for example 
and starting using xdm. Ultimatly, some PATH may not be setuped properly 
for fvwm.

Sure.  The window manager's environment (i.e., PATH, DISPLAY, and any
other environment variable) isn't necessarily set up the same as "the
CLI" (by which I assume you mean from an xterm or other "terminal
emulator" window).

What operating system are you running under, how do you start your X
server, how does your window manager get started.  Sort your way thru
what you do to get the window manager up so you can figure out it's
environment.  Then think about what gets run to get your "CLI" up.
Figure out what's different.  

Most likely candidate would be DISPLAY (unless you're providing
that... see FVWM man page and search for HOSTDISPLAY), next most
likely would be PATH.  Next most likely would depend on what OS you're
using.

Howdy all.

Ok, it took much longer than originally anticipated (due to some odd
coredumps and my just being terribly busy lately) and it doesn't have
all of the stuff I wanted to get in there, but the latest beta,
2.0.42, is now ready for you to try, if you so desire.

As always, it's at the new official site:

      ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.0.42.tar.gz

And it's a little bigger now:

  -rw-rw-r--   1 chines   users     576551 Apr 15 15:35 fvwm-2.0.42.tar.gz

Here's the ChangeLog:

2.0.42
       1. More small Imake fixes & man page updates
       2. Optional Xpm support for titlebar buttons patch from Andrew
          Veliath
       3. Made event handler jump table be a bigger default size, since
          LASTEvent doesn't account for X Extension related events (eg
          SHAPE)
       4. FvwmPager display updates: DeskColor patch from Alan Wild,
          line distinctions between desks and pages, reinstated message mask
       5. Patch to make fvwm recognize some OpenLook WM hints (like MWM
          hints) from Andrew Taylor
       6. Added FvwmIconMan module (by Brady Montz)
       7. Replaced FvwmButtons with New & Improved version from Jarl Totland,
          had to patch to get to work ok under AIX (char's are unsigned by
          default under AIX)
       8. Added DestroyFunc for removing function definitions
       9. Made Exec use $SHELL, like mwm, if ExecUseSHELL is specified,
          plus Exec now does an explicit "exec" as the first arg (if it's
          not there already), to eliminate extra processes
       10. Completely replaced fvwm_err (removed) & most fprintf calls
           (those that were appropriate) w/ fvwm_msg (which has
           variable args, a consistent look, and will eventually
           optionally output to a file as well as to stderr)
       11. Fix from Nobutaka Suzuki for probs w/ Next/Prev Focus
       12. Patch from Henrique to make EdgeScroll wrap cleaner
       13. Patches to FvwmIconBox from Nobutaka Suzuki
       14. Patches for caching xpm files, modules having Popups on
           ButtonPress events, & rc line continuation (from Jarl)
       15. Make SHAPE extension runtime determinite in addition to compile
           time so same exec can run on different machines better (John
           Bazik, the author of XMX wanted this) - Haven't fixed up the
           modules that use SHAPE yet though (next release)
       16. New module FvwmConsole (a good potential replacement for
           FvwmTalk) from Toshi Isogai.  Currently won't build as part of
           the normal process (you'll have to do it by hand until I
           integrate it further).
       17. Added more mini icons from list members.
       18. Added new-system.fvwmrc, which is the beginning of a
           reformatted & commented rc file (from Eli Burke).  Feel free to
           provide your $0.02 on it.

Have fun.

Hopefully the next one won't take as long, and I anticipate the next
one being the last beta before the official release.  I know I've said
that before, but I think it might be true this time...

Also, I'm contemplating pulling out a lot of the icons into a separate
tar file, and leaving just some "essential" ones (which would be the
only ones that the sample rc file would use).  I might do the same
thing with some of the modules.  I haven't decided yet on either, and
I'm open to any compelling arguements for one way or the other.

Chuck

PS - I know I've been pretty quiet on the mailing list lately, but as
I said I've been really busy lately.  If you asked a question pointed
at me and I haven't answered it yet, hopefully I will soon.  If I seem
to "forget" feel free to ask again after a reasonable period of
time...

Hi Chuck,

	Does the new fvwm make sticky icons a different color than
non-sticky ones?  Can it place icons on the root window where they
aren't (usually) obscured by other panes?  These are two features 
in fvwm 1.24 that have been keeping me from upgrading to 2.X.

regards,

I have the exact same setup here. I am running fvwm 2.0.41 with AccelX

Hi, all!

I've been using .41 for a while now and everything's great.  I
downloaded .42 today and compiled it; no problems there.  The problem
is the 'new and improved FvwmButtons' module.  I can't seem to get it
to do _anything_, let alone what it was doing before.  FvwmButtons is
in the Init and Restart functions, and I rewrote the *FvwmButtons
stuff to conform to (I think) the new format.  The relevant lines are
included below.  All they do now is start up the Pager in the lower rh
corner of the screen.  I get no errors in .xsession-errors, no
disk-thrashing, nothing.  Can someone take a look at this, or perhaps
confirm that something might be wrong (doubtful, it's probably me
doing something stupid)?

Thanks a lot for your time.

  The patch adds to 2.0.42 a few of the changes/patches I've posted
  to this list, and that didn't make it into 2.0.42:

    - a patch to make the windows in the pager move in "real time"
    - a patch to allow Focus to place the mouse anywhere in the window.
    - a small fix to paging on the corners
    - a small fix to paging while moving, if the scroll amount is less than
      screen height/width.

  Also included is a fix to a #undef in modules/FvwmButtons/misc.c which
  looks like:

    #undef makemult(a,b)

  and that my ANSI-C compiler doesn't like, and needs to be replaced with

    #undef makemult


  Files affected are:

    fvwm/builtins.c
    fvwm/events.c
    fvwm/icons.c
    fvwm/misc.h

Hi!

I just tried (well, am trying :-) this new version. I had a problem building
it under SunOS4, since it doesn't seem to know strerror (used in fvwm/builtin.c).
I had to remove this call, and it built without a problem.

A few questions:

>        5. Patch to make fvwm recognize some OpenLook WM hints (like MWM
>           hints) from Andrew Taylor

I was hoping this would solve the problem I'm having with Sun's mailtool.
The behaviour I'm seeing here is that fvwm doesn't redraw the window when
I receive a mail with an attachment. For those of you who don't know
mailtool: if you read just one mail, you get a single window. If the mail
has an attachment, it splits in 2 parts: the mail text and the attachments.
The original window keeps the same size, but there is an extra 'widget'
(text window grows shorter to make room for the attachments). (I guess
you have to see it to understand :-)
What I'm seeing is that under fvwm the text window doesn't resize. If I close
the text window and open it again, it's redrawn in a correct way... So I
figured fvwm was missing an OpenLook WM hint. So I added OLDecor, but it
didn't change a thing.

>        11. Fix from Nobutaka Suzuki for probs w/ Next/Prev Focus

Seems to work ok now!

Just one more thing: I noticed a changed behaviour in the window placement.
I only specify SmartPlacement in my .fvwm2rc, and yet my windows are
placed like I specified RandowPlacement as well. I never get to place my
windows anymore... I didn't find a notice that this behaviour has changed,
so I guess it's a bug.

I haven't had any other problems (yet? :-). Great job!

Hi again,

I've investigated my problem a little closer, and have discovered that
the only difference - as far as the environment is concerned - between
starting an application from the CLI and from the window manager, is
that the windowmanager can't supply a TTY. Starting ImageMagick
without a tty (ie: program < /dev/null > /dev/null ) results in silent
failure.

So - is there a way to have fvwm2.041 supply a tty to a program that
it executes? (pty's would be just as good I expect)

Thanks in advance,

Steve

I've had the same problem, and the cure was to set the environment in .xsession
before anything else happens. This is my .xsession file:

---------------------
#!/bin/sh

{ eval `/usr/bin/X11/userenv` && echo "Use full userenvironement"; }||
{ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin/X11 && export PATH && echo "Use
simple path extension"; }

/home/btp426/bin/fvwm95-2 &
xhost +
[.....]
exec /usr/bin/X11/reaper
----------------------

The reason for this somewhat weird construct is that the `eval' thing sometimes
doesn't work for reasons I don't know (I use IRIX 5.3 and Xsgi).

Hope this helps,
Georg.

This is funny :-)  Though I don't think it was meant that way.  To
explain: the behavior I get is that I can move a window about all I
want.  FvwmPager memorizes the path the window takes and haves the
little window (within the Pager) trace the path of the `big' window,
but not quite in real time...

The little window traces the path after you let go of the mouse button
to move the big window.

Is this intended?  It's most funny, anyway!

there should be a 
	char * strerror(int errnum) for ANSI C
but many old headers just define the following:
---------------------------------
NAME
     perror, errno - system error messages

SYNOPSIS
     void perror(s)
     char *s;

     #include <errno.h>

     int sys_nerr;
     char *sys_errlist[];
     int errno;
--------------------------------
so a 
	#define strerror(e) sys_errlist[e] 
would be cool for those compilers (here it's gcc 2.6)

  That's not what it does on both my HP-UX 9.05 and Linux 1.2.13 systems,
  where the window in the pager does follow the moves of real window very
  closely.

  If you installed the patch manually look it over again. If you did it
  automatically try "make clean; make all" or "make depend; make all".

It appears to be in string.h on HP-UX's and SunOS 5.4 boxes here at DSC.
The one 'sunos' box I could still find (4.1.2) doesn't seem to have it 
defined either (but you probably expected that, didn't you?).

You don't seem to mention more  built-in defaults, but they are there.
The default style for "color" produces icon titles that are unreadable
due to lack of contrast:

fvwm.c line 347
  ExecuteFunction("Style \"*\" Color black/dimgrey, Title, RandomPlacement",

I  think the  "dimgrey" is  a good  choice,   it certainly suggests  a
non-selected window to  me.    May I  suggest "white/dimgrey"  to  get
decent contrast.

i'm not sure if this is a bug with the new FvwmButtons or me doing
something stupid, but it seems that if an Exec has parentheses in it, it
doesn't get Exec'd.  For instance, in 2.0.41, i had the following line
in my .fvwm2rc to swallow xdaliclock:

*FvwmButtons(2x1)       -       whatever        Swallow "XDaliClock"
Exec (sleep 20; nice /afs/isu/rental/kerplunk/bin/@sys/xdaliclock
-noseconds -fn "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -fg
gray63 -bg SteelBlue4 -bw 0 -geometry 130x50-1500-1500) &

(all on one line of, course, i just wrapped for clarity) and it worked
just fine.  slept for 20 seconds, then fired up xdaliclock.  however, in
2.0.42, the following line does nothing:

*FvwmButtons(2x1 Swallow(NoClose UseOld) "XDaliClock" 'Exec (sleep 20;
nice /afs/isu/rental/kerplunk/bin/@sys/xdaliclock -noseconds -fn
"-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -fg gray63 -bg
SteelBlue4 -bw 0 -geometry 130x50-1500-1500) &' )

(again, wrapped for clarity) but if i take out the "(sleep 20;" and the
corresponding ")", it works fine...

I am running on XFree 3.1.2x and it does run in "real-time."  I am
going to try it later on AIX 3.2 and Sunos 4.1.1 see what happens
there.  Kai, what OS are you on?  It sounds like the events are not
being flushed during the movement.  Maybe an XFlush() might do
somewhere (possibly affecting certain architectures) ???

I tried this on SunOS 4.1.4 (MIT X11R6) and Solaris 2.5 (also MIT
X11R6).  After some advice from Henrique I ran FvwmDebug and saw that
FvwmDebug does not print any motion events until one lets go of the
mouse button (releases it).  After releasing the mouse button, all
motion events are fed into Fvwm at a fast rate.  That's why the little
windows danced after button-up.

If I find time, I'll debug this.  Maybe you could try this under
OpenWindows?

I didn't mention them yet because the real reason I added them was in
an effort to get it to be able to run without an rc file, for those
people who forget to copy the rc file into their home directory.  The
additions were not enough (it still locks up), and I didn't have more
time to investigate it further.

Perhaps better (or rather, easier) would be to make it yell and scream
a lot if it can't find the file it's trying to read, which it
currently doesn't (actually, it should probably do that regardless).

That certainly does give better contrast, but I don't think I like it
as much.  The 'white' is too much contrast.  Perhaps 'wheat' or
'lightgrey' for the foreground would be better.  How do these look on
your system (particularily the latter, which I like only slightly less
than the black).

Not yet.  It is on my TO-DO list still though (to at least

This is missing too, and still on the TO-DO list.  Icon placement

I noticed it right away because I wasn't  setting 'style "*" color' to
anything and all of a sudden my icon titles were hard to see.

I think  announcing that it is  running without a config   is good.  I
still think  fvwm administrators should start fvwm2  with a  shell and
create a default  config if the user   doesn't have one.  Without  the
shell,  you still can't upgrade from  version to version without a lot
of problems.

I had a feeling it was partly my terminal, although I have a large Sun
terminal with good resolution, I doubt that colors are consistent from
terminal to terminal.

The "wheat" looks good and the "lightgrey"  looks better.  If I get to
vote for white, wheat and lightgrey, I vote for lightgrey.

It seems that WindowList always acts like a menu, never like a popup.
I.e.: when called from the keyboard, it takes two keystrokes to get
rid of it (and get to the window I want).

Is it feasible to do either of the following? 

-- Give WindowList an optional parameter to make it act like a popup

-- Provide a second version of WindowList that acts like a popup

Forgive me if this has been asked before, but...

I have changed the "execl" (in exec_function() in builtins.c) to "execlp",
so that it would search $PATH instead of requiring me to specify the
entire path.  I did this after upgrading to fvwm2 because many of my
menu items broke.

Is there a reason why execl is used instead of execlp?
If not, I suggest the following patch:

I don't think that it's worth the effort.  A zipped tar file of 600
kB is not very large nowadays.  Many other freeware packages suffer
from much more bloat.  May be someone will decide to contribute a 
mini-fvwm package for small systems (notebooks), if the need arises.

At the moment, fvwm reports errors by calling fvwm_err(). This put the
message out on stderr, where it will usually get lost lying in
~/.xsession-errors.

How about sending the text of the error message to an
'FvwmErrorDelivery' module, which could pop up a window containing the
text. Alternatively, if an FvwmConsole is open, then the errors should
probably go there.

What do people think ?

Chuck has already given fvwm_err a better interface as fvwm_msg (with
all of the old calls updated), and has already voiced intentions in
the future to allow one to send output to a logfile.

	Hi all,

ch> tar file, and leaving just some "essential" ones (which would be 
ch> only ones that the sample rc file would use).  I might do the same

	That would be cool, for 3 points I'm concerned in, but I guess 
I 'm not the only one :-) :
	I'm in Europe and downloading from extra-europe sites is very 
difficult since a couple of month. I know some mirrors sites, but they 
are not always up to date.
	My phone line is very bad and make a lot of errors and 
deconnections.
	Finally I have short disk quotas to receive the files. 
Exactly, I can't download a file greater then 1Mb. So fvwm still get 
in, but with all efforts in module creation, I don't think it will 
in the near futur.
	But that's only my advice :-)
	Fabien Villard.

I found a color somewhere, #ffeecc, that is a lot better than wheat for
a light color.  I tried different greys as a substitue for white, but I
prefer an off-white to grey, but have never found one with a name that I
liked (the color, not the name).  I don't know to what named color
#ffeecc is closest.

Hi,

I've found two small bugs in fvwm-2.0.42.

1. In Fvwm.tmpl the variable CFLAGS is set to the value of FvwmCompilerFlags
   if the latter has been defined.  This overwrites the old value which
   included $(ALLDEFINES) and thus removes any -I and -D switches to the
   compiler.  Using CCOPTIONS instead of CFLAGS seems more appropriate to me.

2. SunOS 4.1.3 doesn't have a strerror() function (called in builtins.c), at
   least not the machine I tried.  So linking fvwm failed.  It does however
   have an array sys_errlist that contains the system error messages.  The
   following patch fixes the problem.

*** builtins.c.~1~	Wed Apr 10 19:38:25 1996
--- builtins.c	Wed Apr 17 08:31:02 1996
***************
*** 663,669 ****
--- 663,675 ----
    {
      if (execl(exec_shell_name, exec_shell_name, "-c", cmd, NULL)==-1)
      {
+ #if defined __sun__ && !defined SYSV
+       extern char *sys_errlist[];
+ 
+       fvwm_msg(ERR,"exec_function","execl failed (%s)",sys_errlist[errno]);
+ #else
        fvwm_msg(ERR,"exec_function","execl failed (%s)",strerror(errno));
+ #endif
        exit(100);
      }
    }

I modified my .xsession file to start FVWM with the following...

/home11/imc/bin/fvwm 1> /home11/imc/.fvwm-errs 2>&1

so any error message ends up in ~/.fvwm-errs. Okay it's not as good as,
say, directing them to FvwmConsole, but then I don't use it..

AntiqueWhite1 is pretty close along with khaki1. I prefer gainsboro to
white anyday (#dcdcdc)..

Well on our Solaris 2.5 SPARCStation network I have an alias...

colours 'more /usr/openwin/lib/rgb.txt'

so hunt around and see if you can find this file.

Usually you'll find it as /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt (no matter what X version
you have; symlinks are there to provide you with a consistent path).

I'm not sure if this really qualifies (it's late enough my
time that it's early again), so before I do any more playing
with the sources, I'd like to check something.

It seems like the (NoClose,UseOld) flags for the Swallow command (in
FvwmButtons) should work even during a Restart-- i.e., I should
be able to click on my Restart button, the pager closes itself,
all the swallowed apps get regurgitated, fvwm2 restarts, and they
get reswallowed...

Unfortunately, restart behaves the same way as "Destroying"
FvwmButtons... all the apps get nuked...

It seems to me that this is because Done() in fvwm.c just
calls XCloseDisplay.  Is there any reason for it _not_ to send 
messages to the modules saying that its shutting down? Am I 
missing something obvious here?  

I can understand if the modules don't survive a restart (although
I wouldn't mind if they did), but is it necessary to "destroy"
the FvwmButtons on a restart?

If it's not, then I'll be happy to volunteer to implement a 
change to this behavior/make it user modifiable... 

But if it is, then my sleep-deprived mind will be very glad
I decided to ask before banging my brain against a wall...

	Good day, all,

		Me

Is the "timing bug" fixed with 2.0.42.

I mean the one that gets menus sticking upon selecting them ?

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.92

Hello,

        I currently have a problem due to an interaction between
Xemacs 19-13 and fvwm-2.0.42. If I iconify and then de-iconify an
Xemacs frame, the frame in question becomes unusable: I can't type in
it but I can still open a new frame.

        I've read something about this in BUGS. Is it a bug from fvwm2
or from xemacs 19.13? Is there a solution to go around this problem
except by avoiding the iconification?

        Thank you for your help.

        Amicalement. David.

I don't know what is causing this bug, since I also use XEmacs and
don't see it myself under Linux or AIX.

I don't  link this one at  all, (the non-explicit exec).  Previously I
had a number of Execs in my .fvwm2rc like this:

+  "a&udiotool - Sound Editor" Exec cd /u/dane/audio;nice audiotool&

Now, they get run as:

/bin/ksh -c exec cd /u/dane/audio;nice audiotool&

With the   result that only  the  "cd" runs,  the second  command just
disappears.

Since it is easy enough to do:

+  "a&udiotool - Sound Editor" Exec exec nice audiotool&

I recommend leaving "exec" up to the user, with  a possible doc change
to   explain the  efficiency   gained.  Meanwhile, I   am removing the
explicit exec from my copy and continuing testing.

	This brings up several points I wanted to discuss. First of all,
the icons subdirectory is a real mish-mash of pixmaps. k.xpm and k2.xpm
are two PICTURES of somebody's kid. Not exactly useful as icons. Also,
there are a number of duplicate icons (rbomb, bomb; rterm, xterm) and 
xpms that I don't think should be in there (doom*,xboing,xjewel,etc).
	I'm in the midst of integrating all of the semi-useful icons from
the fvwm distribution with my own collection, which is currently broken up
into 5 directories: mini, small, medium, large, and misc. mini has all the
14x14 xpms, small has the 32x32s, medium has 48x48, and large has 64x64.
misc gets all of the leftovers, mostly 32x48 (?!).
	Does anyone want to argue for saving the 16x16 xpms? My thought
is that 14x14 works for menus and buttons, 32x32 works in FvwmButtons,
and the larger xpms are suitable for icons. 
	Chuck -- if I do this, do you want to replace the current icons
directory with it? It looks as though the result will still be smaller
than the existing icons distribution.

	Also, I took a look at the mini.* pixmaps last night. README.mini
says they use a total of 14 colors. This is no longer the case, but it
could easily be. I looked through them all, and there are 10 common colors:
blue, cyan, magenta, red, orange, yellow, green, black, gray, and white
and 17 uncommon colors. I can EASILY fix the files to use the same set
of colors, but I'd like to add a FEW more to the set of 10 common colors.
What I need to know is how many.
	Is 14 colors good? Should that INCLUDE black and white? Do people
care what I do? :-) I definatly want to add 2 more shades of gray, but I
haven't decided which. I'd also like gold (between yellow and orange),
a darker green, a better shade of red, and another blue.
	Adding those brings the total color set to 16, 14 w/o black & white.
I think this would bring the mini pixmaps back into line with the original
intention of a unified colorset. And, at least 11 of the colors (maybe more)
match colors mentioned in colormap.xpm
	And finally, I plan to clean up some of the uglier pictures in
an effort to make them look nicer. Originally, I thought that pixmaps in
menus and buttons would be silly, but they have the potential to look 
really good, if the pixmaps themselves look good.
	I guess that what I want to know is whether there is any sort of
legacy associated with the pixmaps in the icons directory that says they
shouldn't change?

	In case anyone is curious, the oddball files are:
mini.blah.xpm, mini.cut.xpm, mini.iconify.xpm, mini.maximize.xpm 
mini.destroy.xpm, mini.letter.xpm, mini.netscape.xpm,mini.refresh.xpm
mini.resize.xpm, mini.xpaint.xpm, mini.xterm.xpm
	They all use one or more of the following colors:
navy, lavendar, sienna, gold, yellow2, red2, red4, blue4, lightblue
gray40, gray47, gray50, gray63, lightgray, dimgray, darkgreen, firebrick
	and could easily be changed to use sanctioned colors.

eli>    This brings up several points I wanted to discuss. First of all,
eli> the icons subdirectory is a real mish-mash of pixmaps. k.xpm and k2.xpm
eli> are two PICTURES of somebody's kid. Not exactly useful as icons.

Those are pictures of Rob Nation's child.  One (k2) used to be used
for FvwmBanner.  They are not useful as icons, no, but I haven't had
the heart to remove them.  Perhaps now is the time.

eli> (doom*,xboing,xjewel,etc).

The dups should probably be cleaned up, yes, and some of those others
removed.  I've been thinking about doing this for some time, just
haven't bothered yet.

eli>    I'm in the midst of integrating all of the semi-useful icons from
eli> the fvwm distribution with my own collection, which is currently broken up
eli> into 5 directories: mini, small, medium, large, and misc. mini has all the
eli> 14x14 xpms, small has the 32x32s, medium has 48x48, and large has 64x64.
eli> misc gets all of the leftovers, mostly 32x48 (?!).
eli>    Does anyone want to argue for saving the 16x16 xpms? My thought
eli> is that 14x14 works for menus and buttons, 32x32 works in FvwmButtons,
eli> and the larger xpms are suitable for icons.

The 16x16 might also be useful as titlebar buttons, depending on the
size of the font you use in the titlebar.

eli>    Chuck -- if I do this, do you want to replace the current icons
eli> directory with it? It looks as though the result will still be smaller
eli> than the existing icons distribution.

I would certainly like to see the result and I might perhaps replace
the current icons directory with it, yes.

eli>    Also, I took a look at the mini.* pixmaps last night. README.mini
eli> says they use a total of 14 colors. This is no longer the case, but it
eli> could easily be.

The README.mini is from the initial mini xpms contributed, which some
others have been contributed since then by other people.

eli> I looked through them all, and there are 10 common colors: blue,
eli> cyan, magenta, red, orange, yellow, green, black, gray, and white
eli> and 17 uncommon colors. I can EASILY fix the files to use the
eli> same set of colors, but I'd like to add a FEW more to the set of
eli> 10 common colors.  What I need to know is how many.
eli>    Is 14 colors good? Should that INCLUDE black and white? Do people
eli> care what I do? :-) I definatly want to add 2 more shades of
eli> gray, but I haven't decided which. I'd also like gold (between
eli> yellow and orange), a darker green, a better shade of red, and
eli> another blue.
eli>    Adding those brings the total color set to 16, 14 w/o black & white.
eli> I think this would bring the mini pixmaps back into line with the
eli> original intention of a unified colorset. And, at least 11 of the
eli> colors (maybe more) match colors mentioned in colormap.xpm

I've been meaning to reduce the colors of all the xpms to a limited
amount.  I was thinking that 32 might not be bad.  It's not too large
a number, but should be able to contain enough of the standard colors
to enable the xpms to still look good.

I have two programs contributed by list members to reduce the number
of colors, and have had discussions of this type before.  An idea for
a reduced colormap is in the file utils/xpm-reduced-rgb.txt,
contributed by Dan Espen.  His xpm color reduce program is in there as
well.  I know he spoke with Romano Giannetti who wrote another color
reduction program 'pixy' which I have here.  I meant to put it (or at
least a reference to it) in the last release, but forgot.  I believe
it can be found at:

          ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy3.2.tar.gz

He includes some sample colormaps as well in his distribution,
both 16 and 32 colors.  I imagine that they'll be pretty close to what
would be good...

So, I was going to get to this eventually, but if you're feeling
ambitious, go ahead.

eli>    And finally, I plan to clean up some of the uglier pictures in
eli> an effort to make them look nicer.

This might be subjective, but lets see what you come up with.

eli> Originally, I thought that pixmaps in menus and buttons would be
eli> silly, but they have the potential to look really good, if the
eli> pixmaps themselves look good.
eli>    I guess that what I want to know is whether there is any sort of
eli> legacy associated with the pixmaps in the icons directory that says they
eli> shouldn't change?

The only thing I would like is for them to use actual named colors
instead of #rrggbb type specifications.

In fvwm-2.0.42, while compiling FvwmForm, I get:

FvwmForm.c: In function `ReadConfig':

This is because the function:

  extern XFontStruct *GetFontOrFixed(Display *disp, char *fontname);

isn't being declared in FvwmForm.c.  Maybe FvwmForm.c should #include
fvwmlib.h ?

There's a small buglet in the fvwm man page; ~ line 624:

  Executes \fIcommand\fP.  Exec doesn't require an additional 'exec' or
  '&' in the command.

you can't put a "'" in column one in nroff, this causes the rest of the
line to be ignored.

Change to:

  Executes \fIcommand\fP.  Exec doesn't require an additional 'exec' or
  \'&' in the command.

and it looks fine...

I can just about get FvwmConsole to compile, but I keep getting the
error message:

FvwmConsoleC error in connect

What is wrong

I'm not sure if we have the readline libraries here, if we have, how can
I know? I've compiled comenting out the libraries and leaving them in,
yet I get the same error.
Also FvwmConsole isn't in the Imakefile in the main directory.

Secondly I can't get FvwmConfig to compile. I have X11R5 on this system.
Any tips to get it to work, anyone?

I have the same behavior with xemacs 19.13 and fvwm2 2.0.42, except
it happens when I restart. And it doesn't happen every time.

When it happened the last time, iconify and de-iconify worked and went
back everything normal.

I've investigated a bit further and can now reliably reproduce the bug
for any XEmacs window...

Just do a restart. XEmacs windows on OTHER desks/pages will not accept
key/mouse input until they are iconified/deiconified. XEmacs windows
on the current desk/page work fine after a restart.

This is with sunos4.1.4/fvwm-2.0.42/X11R6/gcc-2.7/XEmacs-19.13

I made a patch for 2.0.42 to add commands to delete/destory module 
configurations. From FvwmTalk, FvwmConsole or equivallent,

       DestroyModuleConfig <config>

will search lines starting with '*<config>' as a first word, delete 
them.  You can use Fvwm style wildcards. For example,

       DestroyModuleConfig FvwmWinListFont

will delete lines start with 'FvwmWinListFont' as a whole word.

       DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*

will delete all lines starting '*FvwmButtons'.

To add new config lines, just like .fvwm2rc file,

       *FvwmButtonsRows 12

with no leading spaces.

You can easily re-customize modules with these commands without restarting
fvwm (Even easier with FvwmConsole).


Here is the patch.

Works fine here on Linux 1.3.90, AIX 3.2 and SunOS 4.1.1 (!) (XEmacs
19.13) also.  Only peeve (which might be able to be fixed by the RC)
is that if I Ctrl-Z for some reason (e.g. accidently) then all of the
windows restore to the same page on the same desktop (which were
initially on different pages and desktops; annoying, but not a problem
for me).

This is only my opinion, but I think CDEBUGFLAGS would be even better,
since if it is defined it would override any optimization flags.  It
is handy for setting debugging flags, and even gets passed down the
environment (however, since Fvwm.tmpl is included, it might not be
neccessary) if you specify the following in the Imakefile (BTW Chuck
knows about this already):

#define PassCDebugFlags 'CDEBUGFLAGS=$(CDEBUGFLAGS)'

About the strerror, I couldn't even find str_errlist on SunOS 4.1.1
(!) so I just replaced it with "sorry!" ;) so it would compile.

I just didn't think the extra 'exec's looked good in the rc file.
Seemed a bit redundant.

I'll most likely remove that addition for the next release.

This is a client-server problem. What machine and OS are you using?

If you can compile with/without, then you have one. The library is 
libreadline.a. This library is nothing to do with 'connect' error.

FvwmConsole is not quite portable yet. I think Chuck can answer better on
this one.

In the FvwmForm man page, the description of the *FvwmFormChoice field
is incomplete.

The man .B macro takes a maximum of 6 arguments, but the definition of
*FvwmFormChoice uses 7, so the last one is ignored and not printed.

Here's a patch.

Can you run the attached patch, re-compile, run, and report the error 
again? This gives me better idea what the error is. I don't have access
to solaris.

Yes it does. If you create ~/.inputrc, such as,

	Rubout: delete-char
	"\e[214z": beginning-of-line
	"\e[220z": end-of-line
	"\C-i": complete

it will bind tab key to complete command and such. But I don't know exactly
how to specify the directory to search files to complete file name and
extract basename by just configuring this .inputrc file. 



It is much better off if you return the mail to fvwm mailist instead of
just to me. Like I said, I have very limited knowledge on other machines.
Also, I personally use FvwmConsoleC.pl but not GNU readline.

I have the same problem with the new FvwmButtons that Justin has.  It starts up
the Swallowed modules, but then does nothing.  I see no error messages
anywhere and there's no "FvwmButtons" process running, according to "ps".
I've sent emails to the mailing list about this problem before, when Jarl first
released his new "FvwmButtons", and never got any response.

Thinking it might be something in my configuration, I tried the sample
configuration straight out of the new Fvwmbuttons.man man page.  It did the
exact same thing.  It started the FvwmPager, and then did nothing.

With all the neat new features I've been hearing about, I'd really like to
try out the new FvwmButtons.  I hope someone can help me figure out this
problem soon....

Well, the new FvwmButtons is extremely cool (thanks Jarl!)

One request, though: I wish the "Mouse" Action option would allow you to
specify modifiers in addition to just button numbers... I want to bind
various different styles of xterm invocation, for example, to mouse-1,
S-mouse-1, M-mouse-1, etc.  (mouse 2 and 3 are taken up by menus :)

I am not sure if it is related, but I am experiencing the "sticky"
windows, where periodically if you raise another window by the title
bar it somehow becomes a Move with the mouse button up.

I am having a problem running 2.0-44  on a solaris2.5 ultra 1 machine,

fvwm comes up, all windows come up however, I cannot bring up a menu, or move a window or anything
else.

anyone know why?  I am using the new-system.fvwmrc file.

I compiled with cc.

I've just built Fvwm. In Fvwm.tmpl, I set:

#define FvwmBinDir  /use/ask/u4/havardf/bin/alpha
#define FvwmDir     /use/ask/u4/havardf/lib/X11/fvwm2
#define FvwmLibDir  /use/ask/u4/havardf/lib
#define FvwmManPath /use/ask/u4/havardf/man

i.e.: I replaced /local/X11R5 with /use/ask/u4/havardf.

However, I got problems building, and it turned out that all the
Makefiles had BINDIR, MANPATH and USRLIBDIR set with /local/X11R5
instead of /use/ask/u4/havardf.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I don't see anything right off the bat, but I do have another
question.  Is it truly doing nothing, or do the non-swallow related
buttons (like the ones that pop up xterms) appear ok and work or does
no window appear at all (except for the unswallowed items normal
windows, like Jeff below)?

Does an ultra simple button definition work (like 1 button)?

Both of you (and anyone else having problems w/ Jarl's new
FvwmButtons) please try compiling it w/ the debug info on (see
FvwmButtons.h) and see if it tells anything.  The output will go to
your .xerrors (or .xsession-errors) file.  Sift through it and see if
it says anything that doesn't look quite right.

I just tested running fvwm2 with that file, and aside from not being
able to find the modules (because I didn't edit the ModulePath)
everything worked fine.

Did you copy new-system.fvwmrc to be ~/.fvwm2rc ?  That is what fvwm2
is looking for.  If it can't find it, currently not much will
happen...

Justin> I compiled with cc.

Under Solaris that should be ok.

First of all let me say this is a great window manager (don't you 
worry when mail notes start off this way :-)

I noticed that between .39 and .42 you moved alot more of the 
configuration for build into imake.  Since I installed .39, I have 
moved to gcc.


I'm compiling for solaris 2.4 on a sparc 20.

What I get is undefined symbols for GetFont OrFixed, CachePicture, 
and InitPictureCMap.

All of these are defined in ../libs/libfvwm.a

the compile line has gcc -o fvwm <bunch o ofiles> -O 
      -L/usr/openwin/lib -L../libs -lfvwm -lXpm ....

it doesn't seem to be finding the -lfvwm from the search path.  If I 
hardcode the ../libs/libfvwm.a file in the list of object files it 
links without a problem.  

What gives?  I supposed I could hand edit all the makefiles for all 
the modules and make it work, but I must be missing something crucial 
here.

Perhaps my site.def and other imake configuration files are messed?  
I also have the problem of a -xF flag getting inserted (analyzer code 
for sun's compiler).  I removed it by hand from the makefile, and it 
made no difference.

For what it's worth, I reported a but to Jarl after downloading the
latest version at his site.  I assume that's what's in 2.0.42, but
haven't had time to upgrade to that just yet due to other problems
keeping me away from fun stuff.  Anyway, I found that if I specified
*FvwmButtonsFont None, it would dump core.  I don't know if would
happen with a different font spec or if I specified the font in a
container.  I just removed the line and it works OK for me now.  I
figured out where it was dumping with gdb but haven't yet had time to
come up with a fix.  Unfortunately I don't remember any details other
than it was an attempted NULL dereference.  Anyway, if you've got a
*FvwmButtonsFont line, try removing it and see if you get any further.

I just installed fvwm 2-0.41 on my Linux machine.  The only thing that 
doesn't seem to work is when I iconify a window, the icon doesn't appear 
on the desktop, but it still shows up in the Winlist.  Does anyone have 
any suggestions.  Thanks in advance

Well, to answer Chuck's questions:

1) Even a simple 1-button definition doesn't work.  Nothing appears.
2) I'm running on a SUN Sparcstation2 with SunOS 4.1.3_U1

I compiled FvwmButtons with the Debug options turned on AND the -g flag.
After a few failed invocations I noticed a core file in my home directory.
Here's the stack from that file:

(dbx) where
xpmParseColors() at 0x174c8
xpmParseDataAndCreate() at 0x1517c
XpmCreateImageFromData() at 0x11d5c
PleaseAllocColor(color = 0xf7fff430), line 1139 in
"/home/jselam/fvwm/fvwm2.0/modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c"
GetColor(name = 0x227c0 "Black"), line 1229 in
"/home/jselam/fvwm/fvwm2.0/modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c"
RecursiveLoadData(b = 0x21d80, maxx = 0xf7fff568, maxy = 0xf7fff564), line 817
in "/home/jselam/fvwm/fvwm2.0/modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c"
main(argc = 6, argv = 0xf7fff5f4), line 439 in
"/home/jselam/fvwm/fvwm2.0/modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.c"

This reminded me of earlier complaints on the mailing list about
incompatibilities between FvwmButtons and certain versions of libXpm.  I'm
using version 3.4h.  It so happens I have a copy of 3.4a lying around, so
I used that instead, and voila!  It works.

Apparently there's still some incompatibility in there.  Unfortunately, I
don't have the time to narrow it down any further.  Hopefully Jarl or someone
else can use this information to find the problem.

It sounds like FVWM isn't looking in the right place for the pix.  Make
sure that PixmapPath & IconPath (in .fvwm2rc) are pointing to valid
directories...

That's odd, because I'm using Xpm 3.4h with FVWM 2.0.42 and it works
fine... (SunOS 4.1.3_U1, X11R6.1)

Thank you!!!!!!!!  I had forgotten about this weirdness (probably
because I never experienced it before).  My problems with the new
FvwmButtons were under Linux, X11R6 (XFree86 3.1.2), ELF, and 3.4*h*
of libXpm.  I hunted around and found a 3.4c, recompiled everything
(to be safe)...{drum roll} and it works!!!!!  (much grinning here)

This doesn't explain, of course, why .41 works fine with 3.4h, but for
now at least I have .42 and the new 'Buttons working.  Ah, well,
something more to add to the TODO list?

	Has anybody got SloppyFocus to work? Is it supposed to be a
built-in command or is there a module somewhere on the net? The one
and only reference in the FVWM distribution is on the second line in the
5th paragraph on first page of the FVWM man pages!

	Cheerio just now,

You may have misspelled it.  It's called sys_errlist.  It's manual page
on 4.1.3 says

   Sun Release 4.1   Last change: 6 December 1988 

so it's been there for quite a long time.

But, that's not the 'size that counts'.  Anything that is near as portable
as fvwm will have it's share of #ifdef'd code that isn't usable for
a particular arch/os.

This is what is important:

punk$ cd /usr/local/install
punk$ ll fvwm-2.0.{39,40,41}/bin/fvwm
-rwxr-xr-x  1 windsor  src  126976 Dec 10 02:46 fvwm-2.0.39/bin/fvwm

fvwm-2.0.41/bin/fvwm: NetBSD/i386 demand paged dynamically linked executable
punk$ ll `which twm`
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  bin  155648 Jan  6 23:34 /usr/X11R6/bin/twm
punk$ file `which twm`
/usr/X11R6/bin/twm: NetBSD/i386 demand paged dynamically linked executable

So..

Ain't nuttin' wrong here.  It's still smaller than twm, which I fully
appreciate.

Your ll is about the gzipped file, mine is about the tarred-nongzipped...

Of course FVWM is great, but it became very very fat from 1.XX to 2.XX !

For Fvwm 2, you need the following line in your .fvwm2rc:

For me, this works just dandy.

Hi, sorry if this is a known problem (i'm new on the mailing list).

I have found a strange problem with FvwmPager: When fvwm2 config-file is 
read through one of the preprocesser-modules, it will not let you move 
around your virtual desktop. I have narrowed the problem down to just two 
lines (i call the file `test.fvwm2rc'):

-------------------------------------------------
DeskTopSize 2x2
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
-------------------------------------------------

When i start fvwm2 with

% fvwm2 -f "Read /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"

Things work just fine, but when i use

% fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"

or

% fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"

nothing happens when i move the mouse to the edge of the screen. In 
fact i need to click in the pager or move a window out of the screen `to 
get paging started'

I have Linux 1.3.72, XFree 3.1.2D, fvwm-2.0.42, and i have seen the 
problem with fvwm-2.0.40 in Solaris-2.[4-5] and Irix-5.3 too.

Have fun,

Hello,

Charles> I don't know what is causing this bug, since I also use
Charles> XEmacs and don't see it myself under Linux or AIX.

        I'm working on SGI. 

        Before using fvwm2, I had a bug with Xemacs-19.13 under Vue
(HP-UX) and 4Dwm (SGI). This bug diseappeared with fvwm2. It was a
redraw problem on vm.
        
        So, I'm now suspecting a bug in Xemacs more than in fvwm but
it's only pure speculation since I'm unable to debug fvwm nor
xemacs. :-)

        David.

I don't know about X11R6, but between X11R4 and X11R5 the list of named
colors changed significantly. (I know because here at work I run fvwm on
X11R4).

Here's a context diff showing the differences (+ -> only in X11R5,
- -> only in X11R4); you can see that most of the "numbered" color shades
(xxxx1, xxxx2 etc.) are not available in X11R4. It would be nice if we
could settle on a set of named colors which are available on all X
versions ;-)

As someone has mentioned in this list, FvwmPager dies when moving
a window on a non-current desk to the current desk, due to
BadMatch error resulted from XSetInputFocus() (at l. 1444,
x_pager.c). It seems that the problem occurs because of "delayed"
execution of WindowDesk function which is called by SendInfo()
(l. 1417, x_pager.c); that is, if WindowDesk is not done by fvwm
when the XSetInputFocus() is called, the XSetInputFocus() tries
to set focus on un-viewable window.

I'm sorry I don't know a good solution to the problem, but a
compromise would be just commenting the XSetInputFocus() out,
unless people are eager to set focus on the moved window...

I just installed fvwm 2.0.41. is it possible to bring a window to top
(focus) without the mouse cursor moving to the top left corner of the
window? I was thinking of the way MSWindows "circulates" windows with
alt-tab. the mouse pointer does not move.
circulate: with the old fvwm 1.x I could define this:

Key Tab         A       M       CirculateUp
Key Tab         A       MS      CirculateDown

now it does not work. do I miss something...

btw I read somewhere about fvwm-95 "which gives the 95 look and feel" and I
suppose it is possible now to include pixmaps in the *title bar*? how can I
do that?

thanks and sorry for the bad english/

There is a Focus-patch for 2.0.41 which is built-in to 2.0.42.  It
lets you specify the position to warp to (with the Focus function):
    Focus   0   0       ul corner
    Focus  50  50       center
    Focus 100   0       ur corner
    Focus   0 100       ll corner

regards,
kai

It is, but it has some minor fixes in there for AIX.

I have one more question: How do I get on to the mailing list

    window and something more interesting than the form app name can be
    specified (FvwmFormTitle?)

  - Need a popdown selector widget style for FvwmFormChoice, in addition
    to the current pushbutton style.

  - I'd like string compare operators in the FvwmFormCommand option,
    like:

        $(name=="foo"?string)
        $(name!="foo"?string)

    So the syntax is really:

        command : "$(" expr "?" command ")"

        expr    : name | name op name
        op      : "==" | "!="

        name    : Name | String | command

    Or something (just hacked this BNF off the top of my head :)  Heck,
    there're lots of cool operators I can think of: perl's "~=" for
    regexp matching, for example... once the first one is done more
    should be easy to add.

  - I'd love to see C's trinary operator supported in FvwmFormCommand;
    it would be much cleaner than "$(name?then) $(name!else)".  Instead,
    add an optional : clause to the ? operator, like this:

        $(name?then[:else])

    Of course, that means that anyone's current Command definition that
    includes a ":" in the "string" clause will break, but... :)  And
    you'd need some way of escaping it.

Hello,

Only today did I find the time to compile fvwm-2.0.42 on my SIEMENS NIXDORF
SINIX-D 5.41 SVR4+X11R4 system. My compiler is rather talkative, and when
given the ansi switch, it is also kind of strict when it comes to passing
pointers to anything. Here's a selected list of errors and a list of
patches to cure them for several fvwm modules; the patches don't break
anything but make fvwm compilable on all platforms (not just on those with
gcc ;-) :

Could this be a problem with Keyboard Modifiers in Fvwm2?

I like the sides to resize as well as the corners, but I would still
like to move windows which don't have a titlebar.  So in fvwm-1 I was
able to make Control- or Meta-click move the window, but the following
does not work in fvwm-2.  Any suggestions?

# Button 1 in the corner or sides, without modifiers, gives resize or raise
Mouse 1         FS      A       Function "Resize-or-Raise"
# Button 1 in the title, or border with modifiers, gives move or raise
Mouse 1         FS      M       Function "Move-or-Raise"
Mouse 1         FS      C       Function "Move-or-Raise"
Mouse 1         T       A       Function "Move-or-Raise"

For now I can use a menu bound to button two to move the window,
but it would be nice if the above could work too.

# Button 2 in the corners, sides, or title-bar gives the window ops menu
Mouse 2         FST     A       Function "window_ops_func"



BTW, I also see the "sticky" behavior, in which a window gets stuck in
"move" mode after clicking and releasing in the title bar.  It happens
often (say, 1 of 20 clicks), and occurs even when the window is already
on top.

There a patch that I put together which I distribute with FvwmIconMan which
gives Focus an integer argument. Focus 0 doesn't warp the cursor, and Focus 1
or plain Focus does the standard behavior. It comes with no guarantees, but 
I use it with no problems with 2.0.42.

FvwmIconMan comes with fvwm2.0.42, and the patch for 2.0.42 can be found at 
mahler.cs.arizona.edu in /pub/FvwmIconMan/fvwm_patches.

I would definitely like to see this added to fvwm. I think the problem is that
the Focus function is to heavyweight. I think it should be split into
functions which just changes the focus, and a function which warps the cursor
to a given location in a particular window, and then you could get the
current behaviour by just making a compound function of the two.

Chuck, you use Linux, right? Yet you said you don't see it like
Andrew does? What is the common denominator amongst those of us who do
see it?

I thought I'd be able to report there was hope, but I can't.

I see the same thing with

  Solaris-2.3/fvwm-2.0.42/X11R6/SUNWspro-cc-3.0.1/XEmacs-19.14-b17

I hadn't noticed that iconify/de-iconify fixes it (I'd always deleted
the frame and created a new one, which also works).

The restart function is broken in other ways, most notably style flags
read in via CPP are not applied to existing windows after a restart.

This (and the FvwmPager timing bug) are IMHO the two bugs that should,
if at all possible, be fixed before the net release.

I was wondering if there is anyplace on the net where I could get some 
FVWMmodules that don't come with FVWM..  Also I was wondering if the 
modules work for both version of fvwm or if they are version specific..

Thanks

Here is a fix collection for fvwm-2.0.42 to compile more plathomes or
to fix typos, already posted to the list (and my original fix). This
patch includes:

* Typo in a manual of fvwm/FvwmForm
* `make' command of BSD/OS 2.x considers 'C++FLAGS' as a flags of C++.
	It causes problem while compiling FvwmConfig.
* At least SunOS 4.x does not have strerror(). Use sys_errlist[].
* FvwmConfig misses LOCAL_LIBRARIES, to specify libraries.
* ugly modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.c fix
	Should include libs/fvwmlib.h.
	Avoid to include <malloc.h> under BSD/OS environment.
	Conflicts `CopyString()' function. Rename to `CopyNString()'.

Of course there are more and more patches for 2.0.42 posted to the list.
Let me summarize...

* Real-time window-moving handling for FvwmPager, etc
	by Henrique Martins <martins@martins.hpl.hp.com>
* Check $PATH while processing `Exec' built-in function (use execlp())
	by John Williams <williams@sharkey.us.dynix.com>
* New built-in function `DestroyModuleConfig'
	by Toshi Isogai <toshi_isogai@maxtor.com>
* XSetInputFocus() problem in FvwmPager (is this fix ok?)
	by Nobutaka Suzuki <nobuta-s@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>

I've collected (in my archive named CFAN :-) some modules which is not
included in fvwm distribution. Here is a list.

* FvwmAdlLog
	Research oriented module to get data about the user action.
* FvwmWish
	One of Tcl/Tk extension, to handle module interface.
* fvwish
	Yet another Tcl/Tk extension.
* TkGoodStuff
	Exactly this is NOT a module but an application,
	includes TkFvwm (Tcl/Tk extension for fvwm)
* FvwmTaskBar
	Windows95-like taskbar. Be with to fvwm95.

I think most of all modules are come with 2.0.42. You don't worry :-)

This sounds more like some confusion with EdgeScroll rather than the
Pager module.  Do you have any EdgeScroll settings that might be
affected by either M4 or Cpp?

To put pixmaps in the title bar, you use ButtonStyle, which is documented in 
the fvwm2 manpage:


     ButtonStyle button# [Full]Pixmap pixmap-up [pixmap-down]

          Defines a pixmap to be displayed on a title-bar button.  button# is

          the title-bar button, and is between 0 and 9.  One or two pixmaps

          can be specified.  The first pixmap is shown as the "up" button

          position and the second as the "down" position.  If the second pix-

          map is not specified, the first one is used for both positions.

          One might define the following definitions:


               ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap pixmap_both.xpm

               ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap pixmap_up.xpm pixmap_down.xpm


          The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative

          pathname (see PixmapPath).  If any of the pixmaps cannot be found,

          the entire button reverts to a simple rectangle with no pixmaps.

          If the word Full is prefixed to Pixmap, then the pixmap can use the

          entire height of the title-bar (i.e. the relief border around the

          button is not drawn).


I have played around with this and have created some pixmaps to use in my 
title bars that give it a very win95-ish look and feel...my .fvwm2rc, a couple 
of screen shots, and the pixmaps i created can be found at:

I do not remember if I posted it here this one. If it's a repetition, 
please bear with me. If anyone have the time and skills to debug it (I 
helped to find some bug in Jarl button's, but fvwm is too much for me), 
I know how to trigger the "glued-to-the-mouse" effect. I hope that my 
english will suffice to explain. I assume 

AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "I" Raise
+                         "M" Move
+                         "D" RaiseLower

and 

Mouse 1         T       A       Function "Move-or-Raise"  

Go to the title bar. Click. Pointer became a black dot. Wait, and after a 
while it is tranformed in a "four-arrows" one. Now, if you repeat the 
procedure and could  release the  button just at the same time the 
dot->four-arrows transformation happens, a move is triggered and 
you have the glued windows.  The notion of "just at the same time" 
change with load ... 

Good luck, you bug-busters! :-)

Key Tab         A       MS       Prev [CurrentDesk CurrentScreen] Focus
Key Tab         A       M      Next [CurrentDesk CurrentScreen] Focus

The top two circulate windows on the current screen, while the bottom two
circulate between all windows.

You can use the circulateskip style option on any windows that you, do not
want to have focus on. (ie. FvwmButtons etc...)

I use this to change the FOCUS without touching the mouse.
You would have to make sure not to use the focus follows mouse,
for this to work properly.

I do not think icons should get the focus when the pointer passes over 
them in SloppyFocus mode. The following patch seems to fix this for me.

This looks like a good spot for me to make a small comment regarding
all of the Focus related questions lately...

Those bindings above WILL work with ANY focus style.  When Focus-ing
on MouseFocus and SloppyFocus windows, the cursor will be warped to
those windows (the subject of many other notes...) but the cursor
won't warp to ClickToFocus windows.

Now, the Focus behavour could stand with some modifications, as people
have pointed out.  I will be considering the suggested patches for the
next beta release.

	Unfortunately, there are three problems: 
a) I use FocusFollowsMouse
b) I use SloppyFocus
c) This doesn't solve my problem, and has nothing to do at ALL with what
   I'm moaning and groaning about. This should help you understand the
   problem. Click your third mouse to bring up WinList. Select an xterm
   window off the list. Notice how the mouse cursor jumps to the top 
   left corner of the window? That is the behavior I don't like. But
   PLEASE don't tell me I can change it by giving arguements to Focus.
   I don't want to move the mouse cursor around inside the window. I
   want the mouse cursor to STAY WHERE IT IS ON THE SCREEN!!! :-)

However, I do like your Next and Prev bindings.. if I can get the mouse
to stay where it is, I'll be quite happy with those.. :-)

I am not sure how this would work to your benefit.
Unless when you select a xterm in winlist you do not want the window
to obtain focus.

ex.
You select a window to go to form the winlist.
The desktop changes, your mouse stays where it is at.
When the desktop changes the xterm gets focus.
But if you have another window under the mouse after
you changed desktops, then that window will get the focus.
Simply because you use FocusFollowsMouse, and SloppyFocus.

I don't see how you can achieve what you want without changing
the placement of the mouse.

However, I am using the fvwm95 manager and when I select from the
Winlist it works exactly how you want.  But I use ClickToFocus.

Guess you have to live with one to get the other. :)

X-Majordomo: 1.92

I'd like to talk about the new Exec feature Chuck added where the "exec"
and "&" aren't necessary any more.

I know one person posted saying a command he used to use didn't work any
more under the new style, and Chuck said he was going to remove the
feature.

I'd like to discuss this further, first: I _LIKE_ the enhancement, and I
really hope we keep it.

I like that I don't have to worry about adding "exec".  And for newer
users who don't really know what's going on, it's a big win in
ease-of-use and readability.

Instead of removing the feature, can't we add a bit of smarts to it to
get it working correctly so that in the vast majority of the cases, when
you just want to start some app, you can just say "Exec foo", and yet
still get what you want for more advanced situations?  I think the
problem was something like this:

  "foo" Exec cd /home/foo; foo

was translated to this:

  exec cd /home/foo; foo

since the cd was exec'd, foo was never run.

One idea would be for fvwm2 to look through the string to be exec'd and,
if it sees something that means multiple apps are running, doesn't add
the exec.  GNU make, for example, does something similar.

I think a sufficient rule is if fvwm sees any unquoted instance of ";"
or "|" in the command string, it should not add exec.  For Bourne shell,
anyway, that should definitely do it.  I wouldn't get pathological about
testing for quoting, either; what's an extra shell or two now and then
for obscure cases?

Another alternative is to keep the default behavior as is, but add a way
to turn it off for advanced cases... a workaround that is gross but that
works right now is this:

  "foo" Exec /bin/sh -c 'cd /home/foo; foo'

which would expand to:

  exec /bin/sh -c 'cd /home/foo; foo'

Certainly that's not optimal, but it works and this is not a normal case
so maybe it's acceptable.  Maybe someone has a better idea.

Bottom line, I think the enhancement is very useful for the vast
majority of cases, and we should try to resolve the problem raised above
somehow without punting the enhancement.

My $0.02.

I agree. It is nice. It would be nice to keep it. But I gotta be able to 
run compound commands.

Instead of having Exec parse the string, maybe we should just have to versions
of Exec. Exec which does the implicit exec, and Run which doesn't. I don't
much like the idea of trying to figure out from the command whether an exec
is possible. First off, you don't know if people are using Exec to send
commands to a real shell. They might be sending stuff something else for all
we know. Secondly, it could get tricky to get right, and trickier to explain
to somebody when it doesn't work. Adding a new command seems simpler, and
might even involve adding less code to fvwm.

Ever used TVTWM?  With the Icon Manager (like FvwmWinList, except better),
you move the mouse over a button representing the window, and that window
receives focus.  The pointer doesn't warp, it just reassigns focus.  The
focus will then be on the new window until the pointer crosses another
window boundary, where it will switch to that new window.  However, you
could just leave the mouse on the Icon Manager and switch focus that way. 
I've been using Fvwm95 for a couple days, and FvwmTaskBar looks like a
really good replacement for the Icon Manager, but without a way to Focus
without warping the mouse, it's impossible (and no, using ClickToFocus is
not an option). 

I wrote a new FVWM command, FocusOnly, which simply focuses the given
window, and doesn't warp the pointer, raise it, iconify it, or do anything
else.   I can send a patch if anyone wants to see it.

Try FvwmIconMan. Comes with 2.0.42 now. I modeled it on the twm icon manager.
You have to apply a patch to fvwm though to get the nice focus behavior. I'd
like to see your patch to compare with what I'm currently using. How does it
handle windows on other desktops. When I wrote my patch, I couldn't get it to
send focus to windows on other desktops (other pages are fine) since fvwm
seems to have some restrictions built into the code about just that, and I
didn't want to spend the time to really look into it.

Maybe you don't have:

    PixmapPath /usr/X11/include/pixmaps

in your .fvwm2rc file.

What is ActivePixmap?

You won't find it in there since it is not part of fvwm, sorry
(pixmaps on the title-bar).  I presume you got the idea from the WWW
page.  This is an unreleased patch.  I've since made some
modifications to the page to clarify this.  Thanks for bringing it up
however, as I now see the confusion it may have caused.

Hi, sorry to bother everybody with stupid queries such as this, but I simply
cannot get FVWM 2.0.42 to function properly.  

It _seems_ to compile fine, but when I go to run it - sure it works and all,
but there are no little buttons in the top corners of the windows, there are
no capabilites of changing the window size <it just stays the same>, no pop-up
menus etc.  It's just two rxvt's, the ones I load in my Xsession file with
borders around them.

I'm probably doing something utterly stupid, but I really have experimented 
a lot with no success. <sigh>

If anyone could help such a sad git, please do. :-)

Regards,
Matt.

With every release of software there is always a period where everyone
has to scream, "THIS DOESN'T WORK!"

Well, I'm happy to say that in my experiences. . . . it does.  :)

I love the latest release of fvwm2 VERY VERY much.  Of course, I'm still
not 100% pleased with menu behavior and I would like to See menus that
allow you to place a title on the bottom row so that the pointer would
warp there, etc.

Putting all that aside though, I'm really pleased.  I had very little
completion problems (FvwmConsole isn't working right), and everything
works great.  I love Having Pixmaps on my window titlebars.  I love
having a multi-colored pager (shameless plug).  AND I REALLY love Jarl's
FvwmButtons.

I'll admit that the syntax is cryptic until you adjust, but in terms of
functionality, it is awesome.  Swallowed Application handling is so much
better now.  Swallowing, UnSwallowing, Respawning dead processes without
taking down the whole bar, etc.

I'll admit that I use vi so I know nothing about problems with emacs.
I also admit that I have only compiled it on my AIX workstation.  I have
no idea how things will fare under Linux, HP-UX, or OSF/1 (my other
accounts).

I guess the real reason for this message is. . . . well. . . . although
negative feedback can help find bugs, programmers need a pat on the back
too.  I think everything is great and with a little polishing (and
possibly GNU autoconf) . . . .. hell. . . it already is the best windows
manager there is.

Thanks Chuck, Jarl, et al.

I am trying to build version 2.0.42 Sunos 4.1.3 and X11R5 (I had
the same trouble under SunOs 4.1.4 and X11R6).  (I already have a
working fvwm-2.0.41, which I built here without trouble.)

After

	 xmkmf ; make Makefiles

which don't give any problems apparently, I do "make" and get the
output below.

I don't know to do now.  Can someone please tell what I need to
do to build this latest version on my sunos?  (I really want to
try the latest stuff!)

Thank you,

Jens

I love the pixmaps in the title bar option.  One thing that would be nice,
though, is if the MWMButtons style is set, that the button would stay
'pressed in' as the man page suggests...if one uses pixmaps instead of the
traditional button styles..

I have 2.0.42.  I use FvwmIconMan.  While I like it a lot, there's one
behavior that it doesn't have:  When you put the mouse pointer in the
IconMan, on any specific window, that window doesn't have focus.  With
*twm window managers you can tell it that if the mouse pointer is on a
window in the icon manager that window gets focus.

To reiterate Eli's problem.  AFAIK, there is NO WAY in fvwm to get all
of the following simultaneously:
  - FocusFollowsMouse
  - Binding something to a key to Focus a window _without moving the
    mouse away from where it was when the key was pressed_.

Maybe we should introduce into Fvwm a distinction between Focus (only
change focus, do no move mouse pointer at all) and Warp (move the
mouse pointer into a window, optionally giving that window focus, too).

There's a trouble I encountered in the 2.0.41 version of FVWM and 
in 2.0.42 also: when I start Fvwm, window borders and titlebars
aren't of the right colour but "transparent". Of course, when I (re)activate
the windows, the colour gets right.

Does anybody else have this problem?

Do you have a ~/.fvwm2rc file?  That seems to be a common mistake.

I was  the   one  that complained  about   the  loss of  functionality
originally.  The solution you show above is sufficient for me.  I also
considered Brady  Montz's proposal  for a "Run"   command with the old
behavior, which would  be a little  cleaner, but given fvwm2's  design
goal of compactness,  I would  have  to favor a little  strangeness in
using Exec, as opposed to adding another command to fvwm2.

Enclosed are the diffs to enhance the fvwm2 man page to explain how to
do this.  (Note that I also  enclosed a change  in the same section on
the placement  of the string '&'.)  Before  I moved the '&', man would
just cut off  the  rest of the  sentence.   (Using "esc x  man"  under
XEmacs.)

There was a patch from Robert Nation (the original fvwm author) for fvwm-2.0.40
which was sent to this list in a "verbal" (i,e, not machine readable) form.
I implemented the algorithm he suggested and kept it in my RCS history.

Well, I _do_ have a slower machine here which occasionally suffers heavy
load, so I this bug gave me a lot of trouble...

This patch cured the symptom for me, though it might not be the final
word on the topic (the detect-doubleclick-by-delay technique isn't the
best of all).

As far as I can tell, this patch should apply to 2.0.42 as well (I
thought is was incorporated anyway), so here it goes (NOTE: this was for
2.0.40, and I didn't test it for 2.0.42 yet!):

Ok, for anyone having problems w/ strerror being undefined (SunOS

put it in builtins.c).  I'll put this on the official web site as
well, and a variant will appear in the next beta release.

Subject: FVWM: can't popup a menu with a space in its name
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92


I'm using fvwm-2.0.42.

If I define a menu such as:

AddToMenu "Window Ops" "Window Ops" Title
+              "Move" Move
+              "Resize" Resize
+              "Raise" Raise
+              "Lower" Lower


And then bind it to a mouse button with:

Mouse 2		R   	A       Menu "Window Ops" Nop


Then when I click mouse 2, I get this message from fvwm:

[FVWM][staysup_func]: <<ERROR>> No such menu Window Ops


However, the manpage says that:

|       using the backslash character.  For example, if you have a
|       pop-up menu called Window-Ops, then you don't need quotes:
|       Popup Window-Ops, but if  you  replace  the  dash  with  a
|       space, then you need quotes: Popup "Window Ops".


Replacing the "Mouse" binding by:

Mouse 2		R   	A       Popup "Window Ops"

Now, clicking mouse 2 doesn't result in an error, but pops up just the
title of the menu, with no contents.


Of course, the easy fix is to change the space to a hyphen. However,
I've been working on the fvwmrc_convert script, and doing this
substitution from the script would be non-trivial.

Could fvwm be fixed to allow proper quoting, please ?

I'll be working to get FvwmConsole really there for the next beta
release.  I really didn't have time to play with it after Toshi
contributed it, but wanted to get it out there for people to toy with.
I did get it compiled by hand (at home under Linux, I believe) when he
first gave it to me, and it seemed to run pretty good.  Haven't tried
it under AIX yet, but it may need some adjustments.

I've been thinking about that, and I think a different way should
probably be used.  I've been toying with a generic parameter, either
to be given to the ButtonStyle command or as a separate one, to make
individual buttons act with a toggle behavior.  That way they could
work with any bindings (not just Maximize).

   well,
  quite obvious error in this def:

char *strerror(int num)
 {
   extern int sys_nerr;
   extern char *sys_errlist[];
 
   if (num >= 0 && num < sys_nerr)
     return(sys_errlist[num]);       /* num instead of errnum */
   else
     return "Unknown error number";
 }

Yeeeeeeeees !!! It works for me (well, I tried it only half an hour, but
loading and unloading netscape 2.0 on a java page... good load).  

So, have you a patch for the other buglet :-) ? Trim it so: 

AddToMenu "Window" "Move%mini.move.xpm%" Move
+              "Resize%jresize.xpm%" Resize
+              "Close%mini.excl.xpm%" Close

Mouse 0         1       A       PopUp Window 

start xcalc (for exemple)  and choose close from the titlebutton menu. 
The application (xcalc) correctly close, but you have got a dot cursor
and you have to click (and ear the beep) before anything else.

Thanks & TIA,
		Romano

Opps!  I remember when Rob suggested that, and I meant to go back and

No, I still think that the method for determining Click, DoubleClick,
or Motion needs to be looked at and perhaps reworked.  I'll be doing
that when I get a chance.

Well, I'll play with it and see if it makes things any better.  If it
doesn't harm anything at least, it'll be in the next beta.

I think Fvwm is the best window manager because its the only
one that's had so much user input in the way of comments, suggestions,
and "what ifs". 

This is the _right_ way to develop.  The producers ARE the users and
it becomes a living Deming PLAN-DO-CHECK cycle where user wants are
coupled with the right programming talent to produce something
truely great!

I'm still working on my project, Workspace, at http://www.mirai.com/wks,
and should have something new to show in a month or two..... (I'm
installing Perl/Tk on my linux box! and learning how to use it)

My hat goes off to everyone on this mailing list, and to everyone
who helped make Fvwm the world's best window manager.

Jim

the bug shows up only if there is the root window under the mouse 
pointer when the application window and the menu disappears. If there
is an xterm or another window all works ok.

Can this mean something to anyone?

Hello again,

As you know by now, I still have a X11R4 server. And I like to use fvwm
on this machine as well as on my Linux X11R6 at home. Therefore I think
it would be sensible to make "plain fvwm" runnable on all X11R{4,5,6,6.1}
platforms.

Yesterday, I sent out a list of "not compatible" colors. I re-checked
today (I always had wondered what the error messages from all the fvwm's
I use (1.24, 2.0.41, 2.0.42) meant:
    [FVWM][nocolor]: <<ERROR>> can't parse color slategrey
    fvwm: can't parse color slategrey
). Here's what I found:

1)  "plain fvwm" has a built-in startup command
      ExecuteFunction("MenuStyle black grey slategrey fixed fvwm", ...)
    which references the (X11R5-and-above-only) color slategrey.
    The patch to use grey50 instead follows below.

2)  system.fvwmrc uses (too) many different colors, two of which are
    completely unknown under X11R4: palevioletred and LightSkyBlue are
    candidates for replacement by a different "close" color from the set
    of named colors; The unnamed colors should be chosen from the set of
    named colors as well. Using Romano <romano@iet.unipi.it> Giannetti's
    "pixy" program, the following replacement table comes to mind (the
    (dist nnnn) tells you how "different" the replacement color is from
    the original color):
      #40a0c0                            -         sky blue (dist 169.387)

    (Well, I think I would use gray25/50/80 in place of 26/52/81...)
    THESE ARE NO 1:1 REPLACEMENTS! But they help new users on older
    platforms to initially use fvwm (without a private .fvwmrc, fvwm won't
    start correctly unless it has successfully loaded the basic menu colors).
    Using the derived sed script (X11R4.sed) below, and executing
	sed -f X11R4.sed new-system.fvwmrc.orig >new-system.fvwmrc
    we get the diffs below for an X11R4-capable system.fvwmrc.

    I do hope that these patches can help anybody out there who's still
    stuck on X11R4....

    Have fun,
	Martin

I stumbled over a different bug yesterday, which could be the reason for
the behavior described by Matt:

After doing "MakeMakefiles && make" on a plain vanilla fvwm-2.0.42, I
ended up with /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 not being a directory, but a FILE!!!!
This resulted in all undecorated windows and no way to end fvwm.

Apparently, there's a "mkinstalldir" missing for the fvwm2 subdirectory,
and all the "install module/XXX/XXX /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2" commands override
the generated file instead of putting it into the subdirectory.

So have a look at this file/directory and if it's a file, remove it,
create an empty directory and re-"make install".

If this cured the problem, please re-report to the list; others may have
the same problem...

BTW: fvwm is _supposed to_ have one little root menu in this case,
offering you a single "Builtin Menu" with a selection "Exit FVWM".
Unfortunately, this didn't work in my version (maybe because fvwm didn't
find the color slategrey; can someone check if this works? What does fvwm
show in absence of both $LIBDIR/system.fvwmrc and ~/.fvwm2rc?)

This is the startup code from fvwm.c:
  /* read config file, set up menus, colors, fonts */
  ExecuteFunction("HilightColor black grey",NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction("XORValue 255",NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction("MenuStyle black grey grey50 fixed fvwm",
                  NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction("TitleStyle Centered Raised",NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction("IconFont fixed", NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);
  ExecuteFunction("WindowFont fixed", NULL,&Event,C_ROOT,-1);

}I've been thinking about that, and I think a different way should
}probably be used.  I've been toying with a generic parameter, either
}to be given to the ButtonStyle command or as a separate one, to make
}individual buttons act with a toggle behavior.  That way they could
}work with any bindings (not just Maximize).

now what would be really nice, is along with that, you could specify
an alternate pixmap to use instead of having it "pressed in".  that
way, you could, for instance, after maximizing, replace the maximize
button with a restore button, a la win95 or somesuch.  

btw, i've got 2.0.42 compiled under ultrix 4.3, osf1 3.2, and irix
5.3.  works great on all three.  keep up the good work! :)

FVWMDIR/system.fvwmrc isn't read by fvwm-2.0.42, FVWMDIR/.fvwm2rc is.

It would be much nicer if the site-wide config file were called
system.fvwmrc.

i encounter this sometimes when i restart fvwm. (2.0.41, solaris)
it is annoying but does not cause trouble otherwise.
thats why i haven't investigated further.

I was starting to get complacent about FVWM but on Wednesday I had a
bit of a crisis.. Some weird system bug is preventing me from running 
FVWM and I'm stuck with NCDwm until I've got time to work out what's
gone wrong.. AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH :-(.. It's horrible.  Under FVWM I've got
all my common functions in a statusbar along with a clock, calendar,
perfmeter, biff and pager all in the bottom 90 pixels of the screen. I 
can then spread my windows (of which I have about 7-8 when working) over
the 6 page desktop... And I get to use _colour_.. Now I'm stuck with
xbms, and a _very_ crowded screen...

Here, here. I'm no programmer so I have to rely on the valuable time
and efforts of others but they do pretty a good job of listening to 
even the most stupid suggestions (see my mail about transparent buttons ;-) )
and coming up with the goods (vertical titlebars, I love 'em), just for the 
hell of it..

Again I'll second that.. Having been stuck with Nasty Crappy Dull window
manager for 48 hours I miss the slickness, and sheer class of FVWM..

round of applause to everyone involved

2.0.42 basically has that capability now.  If using Pixmaps as the
button style, if you specify 2 pixmaps, the second is the "pressed in"
one, but you only see it while it's actually pressed in.  Using
FullPixmap removes the border, so this toggle ability that I was
referring to would be all that would be needed to get what you want.

BTW - keep in mind that mentioning 'win95' along with any idea is
enough to turn me off of it... :)

Chris> btw, i've got 2.0.42 compiled under ultrix 4.3, osf1 3.2, and irix

Glad to hear it.

Thanks,
Chuck

Subject: FVWM: Perl script to convert all users .fvwmrc's
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92


Hi,

I'm in the process of packaging up fvwm2 for Debian, so I'm doing
quite a bit of integration of fvwm with the rest of the system.

To help this, I have written a perl script which, when run as root,
will go through all the users who have .fvwmrcs and convert them
using the fvwmrc_convert AWK script provided with fvwm2.

I have also improved the AWK script somewhat: see my other message for
the diffs.

Chuck: could you put this script in the utils directory, please ?


Thanks,
Austin

Oops... sorry, I forgot to check if new-system.fvwmrc was used at all--
it isn't!

So, here are the diffs for system.fvwmrc (they may not be perfect, but...):

I am currently running fvwm 1.x, and have heard some cool things about 
fvwm2, however I have also heardt that the memory usage is higher. I was 
wondering if someone could tell me how much higher the memory useage is? 

Thanks in advance

Subject: FVWM: deiconification of windows without an icon
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92


In fvwm-2.0.42, if you deiconify a window without an icon associated
with it, it appeared behind all other windows, but is entered in
fvwm's idea of things as the top-most window.

This can be demostrated by 'raise-or-lower'ing it.

To see this:

1) Iconify a window that doesn't have an icon specified.
     -> iconised window is now just a small recangle of text
2) deiconify it.
     -> window comes back, but displayed at the bottom stacking order
        on screen
3) raise-or-lower the window.
     -> nothing happens, since fvwm thinks the window is at the top,
        so it sends it to the bottom (it's already at the bottom).
4) raise-or-lower the window again.
     -> now comes to the front for the first time.

Not much actually.  On my system, I just checked, restarted fvwm,
checked, went back to fvwm2, checked again, and here's the results:

USER       PID %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS    TTY STAT    STIME  TIME COMMAND
hines    43806  0.2  1.0  596  860  hft/1 S      Apr 15 14:06 fvwm2 -version
                          ^^^  ^^^
hines    44000  3.7  1.0  424  656  hft/1 S    11:09:55  0:01 fvwm -version
                          ^^^  ^^^
hines    44011 12.0  1.0  520  784  hft/1 S    11:10:48  0:03 fvwm2 -version
                          ^^^  ^^^

Same number of windows & icons (~40 total).

This falls in line with the last test I did, which is in the FAQ:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

8) What's the relative memory usage for the various window managers
   out there?

A: Here's a little table comparing some of them.  It was done on an
   AIX based IBM RS6000 model 355 using the same number of windows (3)
   and XSession to switch between the window managers, and I used
   'top' to show the values:

      SIZE   RES
      545K  652K fvwm2 (fvwm 2.0-pl35)
      457K  528K fvwm  (fvwm 1.24rb)
      856K  960K ctwm  (ctwm 3.2p1)
     1004K 1156K mwm   (mwm 1.2)
      543K  632K twm   (???)
      263K  328K aixwm (a simple ugly window manager included w/ aix)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I should probably run the tests again and update this table, but the
results haven't changed that much most likely.  I would like to throw
a few more entries in there.

Here's a patch to fvwmrc_convert, which does:

 o corrects order of IconBox translation

 o if old .fvwmrc specified to use the built-in pager, then configure
     FvwmPager to be as similar as possible

 o fixes problem with old buttonstyle translation conde

 o fixed problem where spurious ')' could appear at the start of a
     line by itself

 o handles MWMBorders

 o handles Cursor

 o handles SloppyFocus

 o fixes a few problems with '$0' appearing in output rather than
     being expanded.

 o fixes problems translating menu defns with spaces in the title

yes! that's it. i also got this behaviour from time to time but
thought that i had misconfigured something. now that you mention it
i realize that it always happens with my (iconless) emacs windows.
i use to have a lot of them around and icons would use too much room.

i would really like to see that fixed.

Hi there,

I can't seem to get fvwm 2.0.41 to fire up. Of course I can't load it 
with another winmanager loaded (fvwm 1.xx), and when i put it in the 
xinit/xinitrc, nothing happens when I fire up X. :-(

I am using Linux 1.2.13 ELF and compiled fvwm2 with gcc 2.7.0, if that helps.

The basic stuff like permissions, etc. are all fine.

Any ideas?

Let me try to rephrase the points I have poorly made:

1. I dearly wish that fvwm would decouple focus and warping.
2. I know at least three people, including myself, who have written patches
   to fvwm to do this.
3. If you use my patch, which is included with FvwmIconMan, you get the 
   exact icon manager behavior it seems that you want. On the setup I use,
   windows having focus are displayed differently in the manager, and by
   moving my cursor around in the manager, I can change the focus of the 
   managed windows. No warping or raising. In addition, you could use my patch
   and not use my icon manager at all. No biggie.

Three additional points:

4. I really don't like keeping this patch up to date.
5. I would like to discuss with somebody who understands the internals of fvwm
   better that I how important this restriction that only windows on the
   current desk can have focus. I get the impression that we have about 5
   people here who are waiting for somebody else to do this. Let's write
   ourselves some code.
6. I don't want Chuck Hines to get the impression that I am harping on him.
   The guy does have a job after all, in addition to trying to keep all
   of us happy.

Given, what you  say, and what the FAQ  says, don't you think it might
be a good idea to change the first paragraph of the man page?

Old wording:

     Fvwm is a window manager for X11.  It  is  a  derivative  of
     twm.  Although it was redesigned to minimize memory consump-
     tion, it is now as bloated as any other window-manager  (not
     really,  see the FAQ for a comparison).  Users searching for
     a low-memory consumption window-manager are advised to  look
     elsewhere,  possibly  to  an earlier version of fvwm (1.24r,
     for example).  Future changes are planned to  reduce  memory
     consumption again, if possible.

New wording:

     Fvwm2 is a window manager for X.  Fvwm2 is a derivative of
     twm, redesigned to minimize memory consumption, look better,
     run faster, configure easier, and be more modular.

I've never really though about it since taking it over, probably

And I appreciate the consideration, especially since I may be somewhat
silent for the remainder of the day (having already spent way too much
time answering mail today).

BTW - I don't feel that you're harping on me, yet. ;^)

So, I concede that the warping should be decoupled from the focus
function, and I will do my best to remember to take care of it somehow
(via some variant of one of those patches) for the next beta release.

	Just a minor beef, but remember; since the pager has been ripped out
of the fvwm2 executable (at least I think it was.. :) you can COUNT on a
FvwmPager process, and most likely a FvwmButtons process as well.

	Also, I found a small buglet. The fvwm2 man page says that the
UseStyle directive takes a style arguement in quotes, ala:
Style "Invis"	NoTitle,Sticky,WindowListSkip
Style "Fvwm*"	UseStyle "Invis"

However, that doesn't work. You must do:
Style "Fvwm*"	UseStyle Invis

The first time I compiled fvwm2 on the SunOS 4.1.4 box here, I had that
problem.  I thought it was something *I* did (since it was only my second
compile of fvwm, ever).  I manually fixed it after I figured it out.  It
worked on my Linux box because I already had fvwm1.24.  Subsequent
compiles & installs have been flawless -- only the very first failed. 

Perhaps it's time to do a fresh install & see if the above works...

Hello all,
	I just tried to compile .42 and it kept croaking at:

icons.o: In function `GetXPMFile':
icons.o(.text+0xf81): undefined reference to `XpmReadFileToPixmap'
../libs/libfvwm2.a(Picture.o): In function `LoadPicture':
Picture.o(.text+0x81): undefined reference to `XpmReadFileToPixmap'
make[1]: *** [fvwm2] Error 1

Everything else goes as planned.  I have not changed my libs since last 
time ;-)

Kudos to all of those who are making FVWM the best possible WM around.  
Just wanted to let all those who are actively developing know that all of 
their hard work DOES go noticed.  Keep up the excellent work.

Ok, I've got a fix for it:

Basically, what was happening was that when building a list of windows
to be raised, it would include icon_pixmap_w, which was a NULL (since
the window had no icon).

The list of windows to be raised was passed to the X server in the
  XRestackWindows(dpy,wins,i);
call. In this call, X was taking the NULL in wins to mean the end of
the list, rather than relying on i. Since the main window is in wins[]
after the NULL, it never got re-stacked.

Not exactly. What's need is pixmaps for four button states:
    normal (not clicked-on), un-maximized
    depressed, un-maximized
    normal, maximized
    depressed, maximized

I suppose you could replace "maximized" with "sticky" or any other on/off
window state.

But... that leads to a bug in the way fvwm deals with button decorations: fvwm
assumes that minimize and maximize are always on buttons 4 and 2. Because of
this, three problems result:

    * Fvwm alters the appearance of buttons bound to maximize *only* when bound
      to button 2.
    * Fvwm won't alter the appearance of button 2 when not using the default 
      buttonstyle for that button.
    * Fvwm always removes buttons 4 and 2 from transient windows, even if they
      aren't bound to minimize and maximize.

In my case, minimize and maximize are bound to buttons 8 and 6. Close is bound
to button 2. (I bind nothing to button 4.) As a result, decorations on my
transient windows don't make much sense: I end up with minimize and maximize
buttons on my transient windows. Minimize and maximize typically don't work
(and aren't needed) for transient windows. Because fvwm removes buttons 4 and
2, I can't close the window by clicking the close button.

Perhaps the code used to fiddle with the maximize button's appearance and
presence can be modified to handle a more general case? Maybe the code can look
at a button's bindings and change the button's appearance based on the binding
and whatever window state flags exist at the time. The code must already do
that to some extent for button 2. (In my case, this theoretical checking
wouldn't help: my maximize button is actually bound to a function, since I use
maximize with parameters in several places throughout my fvwmrc. That's outside
the scope of this problem, though.)

There are a lot of details (and complications) that arise when trying
to implement something like this.  I think the best thing to do would
give Charles some time to see what he thinks is best (discussion is
good though).  I think he would want the solution to be as small,
unintrusive and generic as possible.  Usually simple, but generic
ideas end up being the most flexible and bug-free.

I think MWM-like operation would be good, and it would be more
conformant to FVWM's operation as well, however a first implementation
(such as Chuck described previously) IMHO is okay.  Getting too
complicated too early leads to all sorts of problems.

This adds two functions: WarpToWindow and FocusOnly.

WarpToWindow takes two arguments. It moves the viewport to the page containing
the window, then it raises the window, then it warps the cursor to the
specified location in the window. 

WarpToWindow 20 30 moves the cursor the the sport in the window which is 20% 
of the width and 30% of the height. 

WarpToWindow 20p 30p moves the cursor to the pixel (20, 30) in the window.

I used the GetTwoARguments function to parse the arguments, and it doesn't
allow you to mix bwetween pixel and percent types, so you can do something
like: WarpToWindow 20p 90.

If you give it no arguments, it warps to the upper left hand corner, and
giving it a negative argument results in no warping of the cursor at all, so
it just moves the the right page and raises the window.

FocusOnly is pretty simple, and it just changes the focus.

The current Focus function is still there, but this function works fine for me
to get the current Focus behavior:

AddToFunc "MyFocus"
+		"I" WarpToWindow
+		"I" FocusOnly

The only problem I forsee is that the current focus function checks whether
the window is a ClickToFocus window before deciding whether to warp the
cursor, and you obviously lose this now. I think that most people either only
use ClickToFocus all the time, or never, or only for windows that don't ever
need the focus (that's what I do) so this might not be a big problem.

Let me know what you think. I wrote this just this morning, so I expect
problems. Seems to work for me though. Apply the patch in the fvwm-2.0.42
directory.

Yes. I had noticed this too when I first switched to version 2. I have
noticed that these modules are not trivial in size. How much code is shared
between the modules and fvwm? Hmmm, I haven't looked but is fvwm.lib
staticly linked or dynamically linked?

fvwmlib is by default statically linked. I don't know how to tell imake to
make it shared, so I ust edit the makefile in the lib directory by hand to
make it dynamic. libfvwm2.so is only 13K though on my machine, so it doesn't
make too much difference. I have 3 modules running at any given time plus fvwm
so that makes for 39K of wastage if I had it static.

Actually, FvwmPager was a module for 1.xx as well (later in it's life)
as well as an internal function (which could be compiled out if you
only wanted to use the module).  That particular fvwm 1.xx did have
the

But, yes, I wasn't counting modules, because that's the purpose of
modules.  Not everyone will use them and all of the NECESSARY wm
functions are in fvwm itself.  I myself only use the pager module.

If people are that strapped for memory, they don't have to run any
modules at all and still be able to get quite a lot of functionality
from fvwm itself.

Curently static (as Brady notes below).

I believe that setting up Imake to compile shared is relatively
trivial, but as you noted, it won't currently buy much.  What could be
done is perhaps make a second lib with all of the common module
specific functions and make both of these shared.  Then perhaps a
greater benefit could be achieved.  But I don't know yet.

Fear not though, as minimizing memory usage is (as you all should know
by now) one of my big concerns.  I will investigate this, and anything
else that can potentially lower memory consumption, as I can to see
what else can be done.

Perhaps your Xpm lib is an older version that doesn't have this

Perhaps my approach is 'not exactly' but it's probably close enough.

Correct.  I would want it to be general, perhaps even disconnected

True again.

Just a side note - I don't see this (under AIX).  I'll try under Linux
when I get home, just out of curiousity...

Interesting...  Well, your patch shouldn't anything, so I'll try it
out and if all is ok it'll be in the next beta release.

bradym> This adds two functions: WarpToWindow and FocusOnly.
...snip...
bradym> FocusOnly is pretty simple, and it just changes the focus.

FocusOnly would be useful for the problem that FvwmPager
terminates with BadMatch error as well, I think. With the
following patch to MoveWindow() in x_pager.c, FocusOnly should be
executed *after* WindowDesk (on line 1417 of x_pager.c) so
BadMatch error might be avoided.

Hi,

I am the first time user of fvwm95-2.0.41d.
I try to use the example.fvwm2rc95 that comes with it but I don't see the
virtual desktop and the "start" button tasktar.
Can someome show me how to specify this?
Thanks so lot.

ps: I attached the .fvwm2rc95 if you want to see.

Hi,

I am the first time user of fvwm95-2.0.41d.
I try to use the example.fvwm2rc95 that comes with it but I don't see the
virtual desktop and the "start" button tasktar.
Can someome show me how to specify this?
Thanks so lot.

ps: I attached the .fvwm2rc95 if you want to see.

Subject: FVWM: Funny window placement behaviour with 2.0.42
To: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I prefer activeplacement. With previous versions, I got this behavior
as the default. Now I have to put ActivePlacement in my Style list for "*"
to get it. No biggie.

Now the funny part. Sometimes I only get ActivePlacement when I'm on a certain
page on desk 0. When I'm on any other page, or any other desk, my windows get
placed for me. Happens for xterm, xman, and xclock at least.

When this happens, it continues to happen until I quit fvwm and start it
up again, and often it continues after that. 

Has anybody else experienced this?

For the curious, here's the style section of my .fvwm2rc:

#define UTIL_STYLE NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip, ClickToFocus
#define FVWM_BASE  Icon toolbox.xpm, NoTitle, HandleWidth 5, Handles, \
                   Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 5, ClickToFocus, \
                   BackColor #303067675454

Style "*"          IconBox 0 0 200 400, ActivePlacement
Style "*"          MWMFunctions, HintOverride, MWMDecor, Color white/steelblue
Style "*"          SloppyFocus, BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, NoIcon

Style "FvwmButtons"	FVWM_BASE
Style "FvwmIconMan"	FVWM_BASE
Style "FvwmIdent"	FVWM_BASE
Style "*biff"		FVWM_BASE

I found my problem. Need a dumbplacement in my style list. I'm not totally
sure why it works differently on different pages, but the culprit seems to be
the function SmartPlacement().

I am toying with the reconfiguration of menus "as needed" since the last 
thread "tvtwm reload menu file when they change". The scheme I am using 
now is pretty simple and work with the following function

AddToFunc fixmenu
+	"I" Read "| .fvwmdir/sh/reread $0"
+	"I" Menu $0 Nop

*FvwmButtons Apps xchess.xpm	fixmenu user

As you see, I have extended slightly the Read command to do a popen as 
needed. My script .fvwmdir/sh/reread compose a menu and compare it with
what it has previously sent to fvwm. If it is the same, it does nothing.
If it is different, it send a destroymenu command, followed by 
"addtomenu"'s command to reprogram the menu.

Currently "reread" is a script. I will rewrite it in C to make it lighter.
On my Linux DX/2 system, this is already quite confortable.

Here is the patch, followed by the script reread.

btw, I find the idea of reloading menu as needed quite nice. At the office,
we are installing quite a few new users on linux-based X terminals. We are
giving them a standard setup at first. It is a tool bar with few predefined
menus. I will define the first button of the tool bar to be a global menu
containing standard tool/feature everybody should have. The nice thing about
this is that I can manage the menu definition and I don't have to tell all
users to do a reload. It is done transparently. This avoid repeating that a
new command/tool is now available on the network. 

Comments appreciated :-)

I never got TitleStyle Flat to work. :-(

Where do you use it, exactly?

I had it as:

Style "xterm" TitleStyle Flat

- didn't seem to do much. :(

Hi everyone,

I've turned off auto-placement in ~/.fvwm2rc, but it still 
auto-positions windows. Here's the relevant bits:

############################################################################
# WINDOW Placement
#
# SmartPlacement makes new windows pop-up in blank regions of screen 
# Style "*" SmartPlacement

# If SmartPlacement fails, this places it randomly instead of making you do it
# Style "*" RandomPlacement

It seems to be using random placement, BTW.

>From the config, I would have thought this turns random AND smart 
placement off...

any ideas?

You need to say:

Style "*" SmartPlacement, ActivePlacement

Chuck: can you make ActivePlacement the default, this isn't the first
time this question has come up.

But then there wouldn't be any visual feedback when the button is
depressed on some buttons.  Might it be better on a per-button
basis?

Hello Mr. FVWM !

Pixmaps, if specified with fullpixmaps, on buttons do give no visual
feedback when they are the only button there.

Would it be worth it to 'sink' these pixmaps upon a press or not?

Here is a thought.  Perhaps it could be configurable somehow what the default,
compiled-in defaults are.  Like have a file tiat is a config file, called
internal.fvwmrc, and then have a script change each line to the function calls
put in the ?fvwm.c? file (no source avail at this moment), and output it to
internal_defs.h, and then just #include that file ...

This would be a no brainer and I could submit patches if anyone is interested.

Try:

TitleStyle Flat

it is a 'global' style, f you will, not a per-window one.

I imagine it will be per-window WHEN we get around to 2.2.x and Chuck
(or someone else) adds the ability to have more style bits.

I think the ability to do so is already present and is sufficient,
IMHO.  If you wish to use the full pixmap option, you might as well
specify a second pixmap as well with your own sink (this was the
original intention).

If you want the relief border as well, you can use the pixmap instead.
Of course, if one does not want visual feedback, the option is also
there.

I run linux 1.3.70 and X86-W32 xfree 3.1.2.  When I start up
fvwm-2.0.42 (from within my ~/.xinitrc file) I get a normal display
and all of my configuration works correctly.  When I select 'Quit'
from the root menu, the system takes quite a bit longer than fvwm 1.24i
to exit.  When fvwm-2.0.42 finally does exit, the character generator is 
screwed up and the character are either difficult or impossible to read.
I am used to this behavior under fvwm 1.24i and added a call to 'setfont'
in the 'startx' script.  This used to correct the problem under fvwm 1.24i.
Under fvwm-2.0.42 it does work.  I can switch virtual console (Alt-2) and
then return to the first virtual console (Alt-1) and type in setfont and
it looks fine again.  If this were all there was, I could live with it.

Now, I attempt to restart X 'startx' I get a blank (black) screen that I can't
get control of and am required to <Ctrl><Alt><Del> to reboot and get it back.
Even if I attempt to restart X using fvwm 1.24i, after exiting using
fvwm-2.0.42, I get the blank (black) screen that I can't get control of.

Has anyone else seen this behavior.  It is definitely something new
in comparison to fvwm 1.24i.

Any assistance is appreciated.

Thanks everyone for the sunos patch.  I managed to build now ;-).

However I am having trouble pixmaps now.

With the line

	PixmapPath /home/petersen/lib/X11/pixmaps:/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps

I get the following error message from fvwm2:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /home/petersen/lib/X11/fvwm2 PixmapPath


I have now "xpm" icons in my fvwmbuttons, nor when I iconify
"xterm" etc.  (The same thing happens with both the old and new
system fvwmrc files.)

Anyone know what is wrong?

Thanks, Jens

I had similar problems, but not only with fvwm2. First of all you should try
the new beta version, XF86 3.1.2D. This `blank screen on startup' problem with
the W32 server should be corrected there. Maybe this is also the cure for the
font problems etc.

Bye,
Georg.

I have the line below in my ".fvwm2rc".  The idea is to give my a
quick menu of hosts to run applications on...  I bound it to
mouse-3 by

	Mouse 3		R    	A       Module FvwmForm Xrsh

Unfortunately the form doesn't work!  Well to be precise it works
only for the first host listed and for "localhost".  All the
others run on the local host!!  It seems the the name "Hostname"
only gets a value on the first choice (when that is set....)

I think Forms is a great idea, but frankly I am a bit confused by
the syntax, which is not too logical in my humble opinion.  For
example what is the purpose of the first argment to
"*FvwmFormSelection" (is it not redundant?)?  Can't the same
`name' be used for several selections with different values
assigned (if not, why not?)

Anyway can someone explain to me why my "Xrsh" form doesn't work?

Thanks, Jens

Warping is moving the mouse pointer by software control (ie without
the phyical pointing device acutally being moved).  Warping is
extensively done by OpenLook style programs.  Fvwm also does some
warping (with the Focus function, for instance, or if you choose a
window from WinList).

FWIW, I use ClickToFocus for Netscrape windows because their handling
of popup windows (such as the file selector box that comes up after
Alt-S) is broken; the problem can be circumvented by using
ClickToFocus.

Does anybody know if it is possible to specify the placement of icons
in the root window? The default seems to be in the vacinity of the top
right hand corner of the window being iconified. This can be very
irksome since the top right hand corner of most windows end up under
some other window! I know that IconBox can be used but then I loose
all the fancy SHAPEd icons which come with the distribution. Besides,
I don't want an extra window just to keep track of my icons.

Any suggestions anyone?

Cheerio just now,

Hello,

I compiled 2.0.42 this weekend.  It almost compiled without a hitch.  In my
previous compilation (.39, I think), I had installed libfvwm.a (I've no idea
why).  When linkink fvwm, -L/usr/X386/lib appeas before -L../libs so the
system library was linked in instead of the distribution library.  It should
be fixed to avoid these types of problems.  Though I'm not really sure why the
library was installed in the first place.

In what way does using IconBox make you lose the SHAPEd icons?  Are
you sure you aren't confusing the IconBox directive with the
FvwmIconBox module?

Fvwm2 currently doesn't look for a global file at startup, but I think
I'll be fixing that for the next beta...

Hello all,
	Sorry about posting a FAQ question.  It didn't even dawn on me that 
my problem was an elf vs. a-out problem.  But thanks for the no-flame on 
the obvious FAQ question.  Once that issue was resolved .42 was up and 
running like a champ..

Subject: FVWM: Changing Icons for Xemacs
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.92


Hi, folks,

I would think this is a FAQ, but I couldn't find it anywhere...

I want to change the Icon of a window based on its name and/or icon
name. Simple, right? Well, it *almost* works for XEmacs.

In XEmacs, I have 
	(setq frame-title-format "%S: %b")
	(setq frame-icon-title-format "%b")
which sets the name and icon name to "emacs: buffername" and
"buffername" respectively. In my .fvwm2rc, I have

Style "emacs"		Icon gnu-animal.xpm
Style "emacs*INBOX*"	Icon xmail.xpm, StickyIcon
Style "emacs* Summary$"	Icon xmail.xpm, StickyIcon
Style "emacs*mail*"	Icon xmail.xpm, StickyIcon
Style "emacs: *Group*"	Icon news212.xpm
Style "emacs*Summary *"	Icon news212.xpm

The idea is for a normal xemacs icon to be gnu-animal, a mail window to
be xmail, and a news window to be news212. It doesn't quite work: it
seems that the icon is determined by the name of the frame that
"created" the frame in question (since, I think, the new frame-name
isn't assigned until later in the process, after fvwm determines the
icon).

Does this make sense? Is there a fix? I can fix it now by creating new
frames (C-x 5 b) and destroying old ones (C-x 5 0), but that's
considerably less than automatic.

Thanks,

Andrew

A long time ago, for GNU Emacs 19.2(something < 9) I created
dsg-frames.el which is available from the ohio-state archive.  Frame
creation was changed in 19.29 and later and although parts of
dsg-frames.el are stil useful, the stuff that generated the window
name ahead of time, which fvwm needs to do icons "right" no longer
works.  I've given up looking for a fix and have settled on xbm icons
that emacs allows me to set in the frame-parameters.  I don't use
xemacs, and I have no idea if the concepts I used in dsg-frames.el can
be made to work there (I do know it won't run on it directly) but it
might be worth looking into.  If you can't get it from the elisp
archive, let me know and I'll email a copy.  While it's not huge, it
doesn't seem proper to burden the fvwm list with it.

Yes,  I have been fighting  this for a while.    I have to run 2
XEmacs's and I want them to get different icons and be able to warp to them
through different keystrokes.   The only way I have
been able to deal with it is I start the XEmacs like this:

xemacs -unmapped -f name-me

In my .emacs:

(defun name-me ()
  "Come up with different name when invoked on another system"
  (interactive)
  (setq frame-icon-title-format "altname") ;sets icon-name
  (setq frame-title-format "altname")	;sets name
  (setq default-frame-alist '((name . "altname")))
  (select-frame (make-frame '((name . "altname")))) ;resource name
)

It's a bit of a mess, but it works for me.

I'm using fvwm 2.0.42, XEmacs 19.13, and the live-icon.el package which
assigns an xpm containing a snapshot of the frame as the icon when a frame is
iconified. When I iconify frames, I get these errors from fvwm:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 130, Error 4, EventType: 2
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 130, Error 4, EventType: 0

The live-icon package still works, though - there's just this set of errors
when I iconify buffers. How should I go about debugging this problem? Thanks,

scott

In fvwm-2.0.41, this style line:

  Style "xbuffy" NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip,RandomPlacement

and this resource:

  *FvwmButtons(2x2) - NULL Swallow "xbuffy" Exec xbuffy -priority 16

would make the transient pop-up windows (i.e., those created by xbuffy
when a mailbox button is pushed) come up undecorated. This fails in
fvwm-2.0.42, i.e., they come up with a titlebar.

Anyone know what could have changed? How can I get the old
(undecorated transient pop-ups) behavior back?

	This is interesting; however I think that it is once again an
Emacs problem, and not an fvwm problem. I have to use x3270 here at work,
and it has a compile-time option to make the icon look like a snapshot of
the window. When I iconify it, I never see errors like those.

Do you have 'Style "*" DecorateTransients' in your .fvwm2rc by any
chance?  I just checked to make sure I wasn't putting that in as a
default, and I'm not, so I'm not sure what could have caused this
change in behavior.

You could try adding 'Style "xbuffy" NakedTransients' and see if it
helps.

Yes, but I always have. I want transients to be decorated by default,
but this specific instance not to be. So I thought the specific would
over-ride the general wildcard. It did in fvwm-2.0.41.

I just tried doing that via FvwmTalk, and it didn't help. Unless it
needs a full restart for it to take effect, that is.

No, but to affect windows that are already up you would need to do a
Recapture.  New windows should use that new value.

I don't recall changing anything that should have affected this...

Just for grins, try invoking it OUTSIDE of the new FvwmButtons and see
how it behaves.

I've just started using fvwm2.  I'm using version 2.0.42 (as packaged
by Austin Donnely for Debian Linux).

I've found a very odd bit of behavior, best described as "Window
Creep".  In short, as I open copies of Mosaic over the source of a
session, their starting positions move progressively further to the
right.

I've got the following styles in my .fvwmrc2.

Style	"*"		Icon unknown.xpm
Style	"*"		BorderWidth 0
Style	"*"		HandleWidth 0
Style	"*"		MWMFunctions
Style	"*"		HintOverride
Style	"*"		Color White/DarkGreen
Style	"*"		NoPPosition
Style	"*"		SmartPlacement
Style	"*"		SloppyFocus
Style	"*"		IconBox -50 -100 -1 -1
Style	"FvwmButtons"	NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip, ClickToFocus

I would guess this would be an issue with SmartPlacement (it also
seems to act differently than in fvwm 1.X, in that it's not so careful
about making sure windows are up against the top left corner of the
available space).

Any ideas?

Mike.

I just started xbuffy from the command line, after FvwmTalk supposedly
read the new style attribute (how can I confirm what the style flags
for a particular window are, BTW?) and got the same behavior. The
change doesn't appear to be related to the new FvwmButtons.

Oh, I forgot something potentially very important that I should have
mentioned from the start. This is *not* the baseline fvwm-2.0.42, but
rather fvwm-2.0.42+Henrique's jumbo patch:

------------------------------
  The patch adds to 2.0.42 a few of the changes/patches I've posted
  to this list, and that didn't make it into 2.0.42:

    - a patch to make the windows in the pager move in "real time"
    - a patch to allow Focus to place the mouse anywhere in the window.
    - a small fix to paging on the corners
    - a small fix to paging while moving, if the scroll amount is less than
      screen height/width.

  Also included is a fix to a #undef in modules/FvwmButtons/misc.c which
  looks like:

    #undef makemult(a,b)

  and that my ANSI-C compiler doesn't like, and needs to be replaced with

    #undef makemult


  Files affected are:

    fvwm/builtins.c
    fvwm/events.c
    fvwm/icons.c
    fvwm/misc.h
    fvwm/module.h
    fvwm/move.c
    fvwm/virtual.c
    modules/FvwmButtons/misc.c
    modules/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.c
    modules/FvwmDebug/FvwmDebug.h
    modules/FvwmPager/FvwmPager.c
    modules/FvwmPager/FvwmPager.h

  -- Henrique (martins@hpl.hp.com)
------------------------------

The patch applied cleanly, though, and I don't see any explicit style
flags mentioned above.

This is because SmartPlacement doesn't entail ActivePlacement (as it
used to). So, if there is no room for the new window, it is placed
anywhere. RandomPlacement isn't really that random, but picks
somewhere semi-sane: this is the window creep you're seeing.

The fix is to say:

Style "*"		SmartPlacement, ActivePlacement


Hope this helps,
Austin

I've had similar problems with a database application that I use:  Clarify.
However, Clarify is the only app that has this problem, so I always figured
it was a Clarify problem, except that Clarify is the only app that I bring up
without a specific geometry statement, so it's hard to say.

Clarify stores the location of its windows in the database when you exit, and
uses that information to know where to bring up the windows next time.
However, I guess it makes incorrect assumptions about the border width or
something like that, because the window is always about 6 pixels higher than
where it appeared in the last invocation.

Maybe Mosaic is doing something similar.  Then again, maybe this didn't help
at all.  :-)

For what it's worth, I also run xbuffy swallowed in the buttons, have
Style "*" DecorateTransients set, run with Henrique's patch (and some
others), but do not see the problem behavior.  My xbuffy popups still
come up undecorated, as they should.  The relevant lines (AFAICT) from
.fvwm2rc:

Style "XBuffy" NoHandles, NoTitle
Style "XBuffy" Sticky, StickyIcon # leftover from before I started
				  # using FvwmButtons
Style "XBuffy" CirculateSkip

*FvwmButtons(26x1, Frame 0, Padding 0 0, Container(Frame 1, Padding 0 0 Rows 1))

The resident size of fvwm2, which I think is the more important, is
reasonably small (smaller than zsh and rxvt at least).

If you prefer ucb ps format:

  $ psgrep fvwm
  USER       PID CP   SZ  RSS TT       S    START  TIME COMMAND
  mdb      14432 80  521  175 ?        S 12:28:33  0:01 FvwmButtons
  mdb      14424180  574  213 ?        S 12:28:28  0:19 fvwm -display hpx06:0
  mdb      14434 80  516  169 ?        S 12:28:33  0:03 FvwmPager

But the bad news is that many people have HP Aptrex Xterminals here,
which have downloadable (to the Xterm) mwm code that is smaller than
fvwm in the final analysis:

  $ psgrep mwm
  jtb      16303 80  317  115 ?        S 13:18:32  0:00 xt.mwm wmpid=16302

I know it's an unfair comparison (mwm takes up X terminal memory in
addition to the host shown here), but as far as the host is concerned
mwm is lighter, even smaller than FvwmPager. I can't believe I just
typed that ;-(. I just hope the sysadmins aren't monitoring this in
this way. At least I can justify it based on the fact fvwm is the only
virtual window manager currently available here (mwm-2 is still not an
option).

Anyway, just some more numbers/thoughts to chew on in this thread, and
to point out that if Xterminals are in the picture, the fvwm advantage
may not be as clear-cut as we'd hoped.

aye, there's the rub. Thanks for jumping in Dave.

Identify reports the Name, Icon Name, and Resource as "xbuffy", but
the Class as "XBuffy". When I made the change to use the Class name,
as you do, it works for me, too. Although the man page says,

          windowname can be a window's name, class,  or  resource
          string.

it appears to only work if the class is used for the windowname. Can
anyone else confirm this?

I was only able to duplicate the breakage from a fresh start of fvwm
using "xbuffy" as a windowname; I wasn't quite sure how to clear a
style using FvwmTalk.

If someone else can confirm this, is this change intentional? It
doesn't really matter as far as I'm concerned -- I just need to be
clear as to what the rules of the game are.

dg> *FvwmButtons(26x1, Frame 0, Padding 0 0, Container(Frame 1, Padding 0 0 Rows 1))

I've just been using the old syntax; I'll have to try this newfangled
Container stuff soon.

Hello all,

I've had trouble mapping any of the "special" function keys on the Sun
keyboard.  I'm using a type 4 keyboard.  I looked in the man page,
which told me to look at the/usr/include/X11/xkeysymdef.h file.  We
don't have anything like that in the system, though there are two
XKeysymDB files floating around.  My environment points to the the
/usr/local/netscape one.  The other one looks like something that came
with OpenWindows.  Anyhow, I've had absolutely no luck with guessing
the names of the keys.  I tried putting this in my .fvwmrc file:

Key open		A N	Iconify
Key	SunXK_Open	A N	Iconify
Key	SunOpen		A N	Iconify
Key	XK_Open		A N	Iconify
Key OSF_open 	A N Iconify
Key Open		A N Iconify

No dice with any of them.  Any ideas?  I'm using fvwm 1.24 and 
SunOS 4.1.3.

P.S.  If I can get these last things working, I think the entire
department will be switching from OpenWin to fvwm.

The type 4 is an excellent keyboard (layout and feel) -- it's
a real shame everyone is going to the pc layout...

The default location for this header file under OpenWindows 3.0+
(i.e. Solaris 1.x and 2.x) is /usr/openwin/include/X11/keysymdef.h.
Check the setting of $OPENWINHOME to ensure that your prefix is
indeed /usr/openwin.

Ok, just drop the XK_ prefix from the keysym listings in the
above header file and you end up with something like:

Key L5      A   N   RaiseLower
Key L7      A   N   Iconify

which should work for you.  Note the L? designations beneath
the Front and Open labels on your keys.  The osf keysyms are
used for Motif clients (like netscape) so they won't help you
too much here.  ;-)

A mass exodus from olwm to fvwm, eh?!

A good way to find out which keysyms you're generating is to run "xev" (not
shipped with our Openwindows - you may have to build it).  Press the key's
you're interested in, and "xev" will tell you what their keysyms are.

We've just switched ours.  Good riddance Openwindows...

I *really* hope this isn't a dozy question...

I have modifiers on my keyboard that I can't make use of in fvwm.  I hate
to admit it, but they have that dreaded wobbly windows icon on them.

They return keysyms "Meta_L" and "Meta_R", and I would like to use them as
modifiers on "Mouse" and "Key" lines in my ".fvwmrc".  The "M" modifier
currently only makes use of the ALT keys (keysyms "Alt_L" and "Alt_R").

>From what I've read of fvwm 2, it doesn't use them either.  I will be
upgrading to fvwm 2 shortly, so please relate any discussion to that.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions -

I'm new both to fvwm and (just minutes ago) fvwm2.  I'd spent the last
few days moving from ctwm to fvwm and had gotten my configuration file
(not located at ~/.fvwmrc) just about how I wanted it.

So I decided to pull down version 2 beta and run it with my version 1
config file: fvwm -f /path/to/my/fvwmrc

Whoa!  Big problem!  The -f command line switch has different
semantics now.  I got a semi-cryptic error from fvwm saying it
couldn't exec my file.  Hmm, I didn't think it should have exec
permission, but okay, I changed it anyway.  Still no good.  On top of
this, fvwm still starts up but with *no way* to exit it!  Fortunately
I start up an XEmacs process too so I can kill fvwm.

So I guess it's time to read the manpage :-).  Sure enough the -f
option should take a command instead of just a file name.  However,
for backwards compatibility sake, I would suggest that -f have the
same semantics as for version 1, and that a different switch be used
for the new semantics.  Also, fvwm should have some failsafe exit
mechanism that is *always* present unless specifically defeated.  No
matter how early the problem in the config file is, there should be a
tidy way to exit fvwm.  These things would help in the conversion
process.

Finally, I have a dual-headed SparcStation, so I tried starting up
fvwm version 1 with the -s option, on :0.0.  Then I tried to start up
fvwm2 with -d :0.1 -s but it complained that another WM was running.
Once I use -s, how can I get another window manager on my second
screen?

Please!  I don't mean the above to sound ungrateful.  I see Chuck
Hines is the maintainer for fvwm now and that's real cool 'cause he's
contributed greatly to XEmacs.  In my couple of days of hacking with
version 1 I've already kill more than one nit I had with ctwm.  fvwm
is great stuff and I look forward to more glowing reports in the
future. :-)  I'm really psyched about doing more integration with
Python and the module subsystem (yup, I've seen Jonathan Kelley's
fvwmmod.py -- again, cool stuff).

Thanks for letting me blow off steam!

As I recall this is part of the MWM hint overrides. Try turning on/off
the MWM options, and see what happens.

Is this similar to what fvwm95 does? ie. put a pixmap in the top left of 
the titlebar?

[thanks for everyone who helped me with my "compilerflags
misbuild" :-)]

I tried fvwm-2.0.42 on a static grey (bw actually ;-) NCD
Xterminal with

	*FvwmButtonsBack PeachPuff3

in my .fvwm2rc file.

FvwmButtons seems to choke on that saying something like:

	"FvwmButtons: can't parse PeachPuff3 -- quitting"

and then gives up :-( .  No buttons appear.

I would rather avoid M4 (it was ok with the old Buttons in
2.0.41.)

Thanks, Jens

Perhaps - Maybe they could behave in the way that the titlebar does when 
you use TitleStyle Sunken, ie. It gets raised when you click it :)

You might want to check, using FvwmIdentify, what `name' xbuffy passes
to the popup windows.  xpostit, for example, creates popup windows
whose name is NOT `xpostit'.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm 2.0.42 problem with Netscape/Java
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92


Hi there,

I have encountered a problem using Netscape 2.01 under fvwm 2.0.42.  Netscape
crashes (dumps core) whenever it attempts to execute a Java applet.  An 
example page is http://www.sun.com/960416/index.java.html.  I have observed
this behavior under both SunOS 4.1.4 and NetBSD 1.1.

If I run twm or tvtwm instead (and that is the only change I make), Netscape
2.01 executes the Java applets properly.  This problem also does not seem to
occur under fvwm 1.24r (though I have only observed this to be true under
another person's environment).

To aid in debugging this problem, I have included below the following from
my NetBSD 1.1 environment:

    Output of xwininfo on the Netscape window
    Output of xprop on the Netscape window
    Output of xdpyinfo
    My .fvwm2rc file

Please contact me if you would like any further information regarding symptoms
of the problem or my environments.

Thanks much,

Jeff Holden

I've had problems with Netscape/Java pages completely crashing my Xterminal
(the whole ***PANIC*** fatal error scenario :-) ). I was under the 
impression this was just an Xterminal problem but it has only happened under
FVWM (2.0.39 at the moment). Mind you when I wasn't using FVWM, Netscape
2.01 wasn't around so there wasn't any Java around to crash my terminal ;-)

This is a rare problem but still a problem. (Solaris 2.5 if you were wondering)

After playing around with my .fvwmrc file and configuration recently
I found that on logging in FVWM started up and then chucked me straight out 
again... after a breif spell in NCDwm purgatory I'm back in FVWM heaven. 
I eventually traced the fault to a missing or faulty icon in one of my
menus. And it struck me that having FVWM dump you out just because it 
can't read an pixmap is silly.. It didn't even leave any errors for me to 
read.. After all if it can't find a colour it just says "couldn't parse 
firebick2" or whatever.

Would it not be better for it to report the lack of pixmaps and just 
carry on regardless leaving a blank space or "unknown1.xpm" instead?

Near as  I could tell,  this is fvwm2  getting an indication  that the
pixmap is invalid.  However if  you capture the xpm that  live-icon.el
creates,  and display it with xv,  it  is perfectly valid, and doesn't
cause any error messages.

I    tried      following the    code     in   XEmacs    that executes
"x-set-frame-icon-pixmap", but wasn't  really successful.   I would be
interested in what is behind this also.

The   only helpful advice   I have is  use   "contool" as your console
process.   (Find  it with archie.)  This is  the most flexible console
process I have seen to  date.  I was able  to enter a "filter" into it
that ignores those pesky messages.

Why would you want to have the WM pick a place for the window and then
have it force you to move it around with the mouse and then click before
you can start typing?  Just curious.

I was (coincidentally) doing something very similar last night with
xv transient windows. I have DecorateTransients set globally, and 
wanted xv windows to be plain. To make the story short, it worked fine.

But not after a few blunders on my part. Make sure that you watch any
errors that get output -- I managed to mispell two different style
directives: NakedTransient and NoTitle are both singular. :-)

SmartPlacement means that if there is room on-screen for the window,
then it will be placed there automatically.

DumbPlacement won't bother looking for space on screen.

ActivePlacement and RandomPlacement specify the policy to be used if
SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement fail.

Get the program xkeycaps from ftp.x.org.  Not only will it tell you
what the keysym names are, it will generate appropriate xmodmap code
for you to modify them if necessary.  In fact, you can use it to make
your keyboard match your .fvwm2rc :-)

Both fvwm 1 and 2 can use more modifiers.  I've been using them since
1.22.  Ensure that the key in question is bound (via xmodmap - but get
xkeycaps from ftp.x.org - you'll be glad you did) to mod2, mod3, mod4
or mod5.  mod1 is typically the Meta key.  Then use the modifier
number in .fvwmrc.  For example, on my Sun keyboard, the "diamond" keys
(left and right) are meta and I've bound the alt and compose keys to
mod2.  In .fvwm2rc I have:

Key Down A 2M Popup "mainmenu"

So when I press the down arrow in combination with Alt (that's the 2)
and the Meta keys I get my menu popup.

It should be working for all of those, as I've made no changes to the

You can't really clear a style spec currently, although this might not
be a bad idea.  I'll put it on the TO-DO list.

It shouldn't have changed - name, class, or resource *should* all
still be acceptable.  As I said, I'll investigate.

Yep. I have a type 5/pc; first thing in my signon is to put the Control key
next to the 'A' key, where God intended it to be. (Sun does - or did - have
a Unix layout of the type 5 keyboard, with the CapsLock under the shift key.
You have to explicitly ask for it, though, from what I understand.)

One problem is that the keysyms assigned to those keys vary depending on
which server you are running.

Under X11R6.1, which I'm currently running, you'll use "SunOpen".
Under X11R5 (and OpenWindows), use "F17". ("L7" is a synonym for "F17".)

The nicest way to find out the keysyms (and other things, as well as change
the keymapping) is xkeycaps by Jamie Zawinsik <jwz@netscape.com>. It can be
found in ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications, with the current version
being  xkeycaps-2.29.tar.Z.

The poor man's alternative is xev; run it, put the mouse in the window and
press the key. In part of the voluminous output of xev, there will be the
keysym.

Hi!

I'm new to this list, so forgive me if this is an FAQ. It would be kind to
receive a pointer in the right direction in this case ;-)

Now here is my problem: i would like to have my fvwm button bar nicely 
centered at the bottom of the screen regardsless of which machine i'm
logging on from. This is necessary because i have terminal with 
resolution as high as 1600x1280 and as low as 800x600.

So it would be nice to preprocess my .fvwmrc with fvwmm4 or fvmwcpp to change
the line

*FvwmButtonsGeometry 1000x70+140-1

to something using the variables HEIGHT and WIDTH like

using the variables HEIGHT and WIDTH like

*FvwmButtonsGeometry (0.9*WIDTH)x(0.1*HEIGHT)+(0.05*WIDTH)-1


I know that this can be done (since these two modules are designed for this
purpose) but i have not the slightest idea about the correct way of writing
this. If someone out there uses this technique to accomplish something similiar
please send me and info.

Any help would be great

thanx

Andreas

Yup, I plan to make that change for the next beta release.  Actually,
I wanted to get it into 2.0.42, but rushed at the end to get it out
because it was taking so long and neglected to make that change.
2.0.43 will have -f <configfile> like 'normal' and a -cmd <configcmd>
for the alternate method.

BAW> Also, fvwm should have some failsafe exit mechanism that is
BAW> *always* present unless specifically defeated.  No matter how
BAW> early the problem in the config file is, there should be a tidy
BAW> way to exit fvwm.  These things would help in the conversion
BAW> process.

Actually, I'm trying to figure out why it's locking up when no config
file is available.  There are a lot of defaults in there now
(including one menu bound to a button press over the root window which
is just 'Exit FVWM'), and I thought that would be sufficient, but
apparently not since it still doesn't work.  I hope to have this
cleared up for the next beta as well though.

BAW> Finally, I have a dual-headed SparcStation, so I tried starting
BAW> up fvwm version 1 with the -s option, on :0.0.  Then I tried to
BAW> start up fvwm2 with -d :0.1 -s but it complained that another WM
BAW> was running.  Once I use -s, how can I get another window manager
BAW> on my second screen?

Unfortunately I don't have access to any multiple display systems, so
I can't test this out...  As I recall though, I think Rob said that
the multiple screen code was lacking some.

What happens if you don't use the -s?  Does that work - does fvwm2
control both screens?

And I think that someone else out there on the list has done this
before.  Does anyone have any advice/experience/etc with this?

Hey, thanks for the ego boost there Barry!  Although I think that the

my lack of activity on the current beta...

BAW> -- again, cool stuff).

Sounds like you'll be making some good contributions then!  I've never
played with Python myself, but I know it's gaining in popularity.  And
any additional interfaces for modules can only be good for fvwm, I
think.  There's some Tcl/Tk ones already, I'd like to make a Perl
interface, and now Python.  Pretty cool...

BAW> Thanks for letting me blow off steam!

No problem.

Using a different window manager, I used to have the above line in my
config file.  You might have to toy some more with the translit
function.  Also, there is eval, I think, which lets you do numeric
computations.  I don't recall how I did *that*, though.

Actually, it's not a bad idea, but I might change it slightly, like
changing the character from "|" to "<".

And I'll probably include the 'reread' script as well.

This happens under AIX on PowerPC machines pretty often too.  Netscape
can bring down the Xserver, although I don't know why.  It seems to
happen more often w/ fvwm (but has happened under mwm as well, I
believe), but I think that's because the Netscape window gets mapped
and unmapped more often due to switching pages and desktops.  My
officemate sees this problem a lot.  He thinks it's something with the
scrollbars.

Hi there,

maybe this is simpleminded and all of you can do this much better in
three seconds than I can in three hours, but anyway ... here goes.

I use the following A LOT.  It lets me choose a window with a specific
name.  I use the mostly for xterms where I put the host name into the
window title.  Nice alternative to the window list for a keyboard
oriented person like me.

Here's the part that goes in the module specification, most of it
shamelessly stolen from that example in system.fvwmrc:

##########################FvwmForm#Select#Window########################
*SelWinWarpPointer
*SelWinFont         *helvetica*m*r*n*14*
*SelWinButtonFont   *helvetica*m*o*n*14*
*SelWinInputFont    *cour*m*r*n*14*
*SelWinFore         Black
*SelWinBack         Light Gray
*SelWinItemFore          Wheat
*SelWinItemBack          Gray50
# begin items
*SelWinLine         center
*SelWinText         "Select Window"
*SelWinLine         center
*SelWinText         "Pattern:"
*SelWinInput        WinPat  20   ""
*SelWinLine         expand
*SelWinButton       quit "Go"        ^M
*SelWinCommand      Next [*$(WinPat)*] Function GoThere
*SelWinButton       restart   "Clear"
*SelWinButton       quit "Cancel"  ^[
*SelWinCommand Nop

Here's the part that assigns a key (should actually come first in
.fvwm2rc):

# name          context modifier action
Key g           A       3       Module FvwmForm SelWin

On my Sun Type 5 keyboard that means Alt-g pops up the window.

Oh, and there's the function GoThere:

# choose this version if Focus groks arguments (2.0.42 and up?)
AddToFunc GoThere               "I" Iconify -1
+                               "I" Focus 50 50

# choose this version for old -style Focus commands
AddToFunc GoThere               "I" Iconify -1
+                               "I" Focus
+                               "I" CursorMove 3 3

Is this worth an example in example.fvwmrc?
Is there a way to make this case-insensitive?

  "Does" have it ... Have to ask for type 5/UNIX layout and pay a few

I, too, have a dual-headed SPARCStation, and fvwm handles both 
displays for me just fine.  The secret is: *don't* use the -s, unless 
you want to do something screwey (like run fvwm on one and olwm on 
the other).  fvwm correctly detects/handles multiple displays without 
user intervention.

One thing you may want to consider, is that on a dual-headed system, 
getting the most out of fvwm really requires m4/cpp preprocessing, 
since you'll want different configurations on each display.

I have no idea what fvwm95 does.  All this does is put a pixmap in the
center of the titlebar (with three states, active{up,down} and
inactive).

Maybe you are suggesting that similar options be available for the
titlebar buttons as well.  This is somewhat understandable, and might
be a good idea.  I'm in a bind this and next week, but I want to get
Charles some code optimizations and reductions first and see what he
thinks.  BTW, it would be fairly easy to add as you suggest.  The only
part is to reduce the number of needed style types to a minimum.

There could be an added button style or a few, which after the code
reduction should only incur a marginal code increase.  However, the new
styles would have to be chosen carefully, and it might be best that it
is tested as a patch against 2.0.42 first so we can get feedback.

Regarding the maximize problem, the code says if MWMButtons is
specified than only the rightmost button gets reversed polarity when
maximized.  An additional method might be to have extra style flag
bits for buttons (which would not increase structure size).  What
comes to mind is to assign preferred buttons a button style flag of
MWMButton, which will act so on windows which have the MWMButtons
style flag.

The maximize problem would need to be worked on first.  It is due to
only a few lines of code, and I am going to suggest a solution to this
(which also adds flexibility) Charles about this and see what he
thinks (he is working on something also).  It involves using added
style flags for the button, while not increasing code size (--
actually, I wouldn't be surprised if Chuck has already done something
like this :).  My god, I'm needlessly rambling again, sorry!

fvwm95 has to find a way to take the icon specification for each window,
miniaturise the pixmap and place that in the top left hand corner.

such a feature would of course be very useful in fvwm(mini icons would
be unnecessary) however chuck has said that a previous attempt to do
this failed. 

Perhaps someone out there would like to have a go at this. I'm still a
novice at X programing, as my work doesn't need gui's, so I'll be of
limited help.

I think this would be worthwhile though and would save the need for
playing around with xpm sizes.

We have this behaviour all the time since I upgraded from 1.24 to
2.40. It shows only on the couple of b/w displays we still have (SUN
Workstations and NCD X-Terminals) but never on color-displays.

The OS is Solaris 2.4.

Since we're about to replace the old machines I never bothered, but
the problem definitely exists.

I'm not sure how to accomplish this. The popup windows only popup when
the left mouse button is pushed; when you release the button they
disappear. Anyone know of a trick to do it?

Try using editres on it.  Pop up the window one time before you do as
most (? many?) X programs create widgets the first time they're needed
and then just manage and unmanage (display and hide) them.

You can set up xbuffy to pop up the window when mail arrives and keep
it up for some period of time using the headertime directive in
.xbuffy (there's probably a command line flag as well).  Then run
FvwmIdent on it.  I just tried it.  Sure enough, the class is XBuffy,
but the window name is the name I assigned the mailbox with the title
directive in .xbuffy.

You still did not compile correctly.  Some parts of your program think
XPM is compiled in and other don't resulting in that strange error message.
The fix is to modify Fvwm.tmpl so for FvwmCompilerFlags you change CFLAGS
to CCOPTIONS. Then make clean and do another xmkmf, make Makefiles, make.

Sounds very nice, could it be extented to tile over the titlebar instead
of just centering?  That way you can have completely textured titlebars.

Is this really useful though :)?  If you really want something like
this, it should probably be compilation disabled by default I think,
since for some it would certainly unnecessarily increase memory
(personally, I determine what the window contains by looking in the
window rather than at the icon in the upper-left ;^) )

However, probably a "conservative" way to do it might be to add a
function to pixmap cache which would, given a pixmap file, return a
[cached] reduced version.

I noticed that when I resize a windows frame and bump into the virtual
desktop edge the frame is resized to fit across the entire virtual
desktop.  In my case three displays.  Has anyone else noticed this?
If I resize a frame across a display boundary that is not also the
cirtual boundary it works fine.

thanks,

Wrong. It is the client's X11 librarary which decideds the names.
Xlib reads its own XKeysymdb then translating keys.

That means that OpenWindows 3.0 (which is X11R4) for example uses
SunXK_Open ,OpenWIndows 3.3 (Solaris 2.4 and X11R5) SunOpen
dito for X11R6 distribution.

Key translation is purely done by the client side.

     Mode_Switch+Open Key => SunOpen  (Mode_Switch usually assigned to Alt
                                       Graph)
Under R6 and R6.1, it is assigned:
  'SunOpen NoSymbol F17':
    Open Key              => SunOpen
    Shift+Open Key        => SunOpen
    Mode_Switch+Open Key  => F17

Note the difference. When you press the 'Open' key in OpenWindows or 'R5,
the keysym the client gets is F17, or L7. In 'R6, it gets SunOpen or
SunKX_Open (0x1005FF73, if you want the hex code, which is the same in all
implementations). The net result is that a client looking for some variation
of 'Sun*Open' will see it without any modifiers under 'R6, but won't see it
unless Alt Graph is also pressed under OpenWindows or 'R6.

Check the output of 'xmodmap -pk' for more details.

There were a lot of questions when 'R6 came out to the effect of 'why are my
OpenWindows clients broken?'.  This was because the keysym mapping was
changed from 'R5 to 'R6.

Indeed this seems to be a problem in fvwm (at least in 1.24r).

I've some applications, which store the window locations from previous
invocations in the same manner.  Whenever such an application program
creates a window using the x,y-coordinates remembered from the previous
run, the new window is moved right and down about the framewidth
resp. framewidth + titlebar height.  This does not happen with mwm,
SGIs 4Dwm or Solaris ol(v)wms.

fvwm seems to use the x,y-coordinates delivered to XCreateWindow for
upper left corner of the frame window and not the pane window as 
other window managers happen to do.  So the pane window get's 
increased x,y coordinates for each new run of the application.

I've looked into fvwm-1.24r/fvwm/placement.c and this behaviour seems to be
intended by the author.  There is the following comment line near the
end of the function 'PlaceWindow':
	/* put it where asked, mod title bar */

Any idea, how to keep this applications from drifting further into 
the south east corner of the screen each time they are invoked ?
Editing 'placement.c' was my first idea, but that has the serious
disadavantage of having to edit all -geometry options in .fvwmrc,
.xinitrc and the like, whenever the framewidth or title bar height
is going to be changed.

Yes, that is correct.  This is (for me at least) one annoying
point about "xbuffy": the popups have the class/resource name set
to name of the mailbox (newsbox).

Yep.  Try renaming the old libfvwm.a (in /usr/lib/X11) to something like
libfvwm.a.old & try relinking.  For some reason, make grabs that version
and not the version that's in ../lib.  I've run into this before & I
always rename the old libfvwm.a to something else before I link. 

A hack, but it works. :(

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The man page for FvwmButtons says:
       If the FvwmButtons executable is linked to  another  name,
       ie ln -s FvwmButtons TermStuff, then another module called
       TermStuff can be started, with a completely different con-
       figuration  than  FvwmButtons, simply by changing the key-
       words FvwmButtons??? to Term???. This way multiple button-
       bars can be used.

I have done this and cannot get it to fire up.

What I want is to have a button on the first bar to be able to 
fire up another toolbar.  I can get it to start the FvwmButtons
module *again*, but after making that link, it still says:

fvwm: No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm95-2/ NetButtons


  Or could a button fire up a Popup 
menu?  I'm getting too many buttons on the toolbar.

Thanks in advance!

  Mea culpa! I sent Chuck a patch to fix some other wrap around problem in
  virtual.c, and when looking at the code thought I could simplify another
  section.  I did warn Chuck that my simplification was probably
  overlooking something, more or less in these terms:

  and that seems to be the case :-(

  The patch below restores the 2.0.41 code, and should fix the problem
  David bumped into. It should apply (although I haven't tried) to either
  the 2.0.42 distribution or the distribution+my_mega_patch.

I second this.  It would be a very nice effect.

(the suggestion was mainly for fvwm95)



well if you were to have a pixmap in a button, you would be taking up
memory anyway. Therefore if you were to use a pixmap that is already in
the cache, you would save memory. The same goes for pixmaps in menus,
reused they would save memory. I reckon that all you need to do is to
reduce the pixmap's implementation and not its place in memory(i.e. load
the full pixmap and only reduce it for use); unless of course I'm
missing something about the xpm package and X.

cool, huh?  :)

A couple of questions:
1. I always see the following error when I Restart fvwm2:
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2c00003
  Serial number of failed request:  2645
  Current serial number in output stream:  2646
FVWM: Call of 'fvwm' failed!!!!
...I assume it has something to do with FvwmButtons & a Swallowed 
process.

2. I have trouble raising some Sun 'tool' subwindows.  For example 
imagetool has a palette subwindow.  I press mouse button 3 in the 
palette's title bar and it does RaiseLower correctly.  However, I do 
the same thing in the main window and it refuses to raise - it'll 
lower but not raise.
The relevant config line:
Mouse 3 TSIF    A       RaiseLower

3. This may be the wrong place to ask, but the exmh group hasn't been 
much help so far...
I use exmh on fvwm2 on openwin on Solaris 2.5
In the simple edit text window, the paste operation is now putting 
text at the MOUSE cursor location, where on my Linux system at home 
it gets pasted at the TEXT cursor location.  Is there some well-known 
X resource that may be causing this behavior?

Thanks and keep up the good work.

-Tom

I feel incredibly stupid for not immediately realising that the old lib
was getting found before the new. ;)
Suggestion: Might it be a good idea to change the Makefile to link
"../libs/libfvwm2.a", rather than "-L../libs -lfvwm2" ?

Thanks.

Probably not a bad idea...I'll most likely do this for the next beta
release.

they hit an end and the other one need to be used.

I did not see this in the BUGS file, so I thought I would report it.

Also, the default .fvwmrc had Circulate commands, which do not do anything.

Bug or feature?

Do you have 'CirculateSkip' in any Style commands?

Known bug, or rather feature.  I've had request to allow them to
circle, and I'll probably add it as an option to Next & Prev
eventually, which you will find reference to in the TO-DO list.

Really?  The one I shipped in 2.0.42 doesn't have them in there, so
you must be getting a default .fvwm2rc from somewhere else or reusing
an old 1.xx .fvwmrc.

I switched to fvwm. And the system (Sun Sparc 10) seems to be overloaded by 
the window manager related processes... Do you know if there is a fix to this? 
If the GoodStuff comes at such a heavy price (75% of CPU time) I would rather 
not have it... 
 
Thanks in advance,

I've had a similar problem in the past where anytime I start or restart fvwm
some of my icons would go to 0,0 before they pop into the proper position.
If there's a window at 0,0 covering them, they don't move into place until
they're exposed.

Perhaps that's where your icons went?

It shouldn't be taking more than a few percent of the CPU at any given
moment.  Something odd must be going on there.  Are you really running
3 of them at once, or have they just locked up so you started another
one, etc.

A simple fix - kill those processes and don't run the GoodStuff
toolbar again.  It's nice and all, but not necessary.

Also, what version are you running?  I know it's 1.xx, but is it the
last of the released versions (1.24r) or a much earlier version?  I'd
recommend trying 1.24r if you're currently trying an earlier version,
or if you are feeling brave you could try the latest 2.xx beta
version...  (see http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/)

Other than that, it could be a bug in your compiler (or just the way
it was comiled), X libs, etc.  Basically, I'm not sure what the
problem is.

The included sample system.fvwmrc & new-system.fvwmrc should be able
to help.  Basically, something like:

*should* work just fine.  I use the first two occasionally and haven't
had any problems with them.  I just tried the latter two, and they
seemed to work ok...whoops, I take that back.  It doesn't seem to be
finding all the ones on the current screen, just the ones I've visited
recently...  This may be the problem.  I'll have to look into that.

Hm...  I didn't think that FvwmAuto worked too well with
ClickToFocus...

SloppyFocus is still supported (as a Style command, like ClickToFocus
and MouseFocus).  I keep updating the docs as I come across missing
stuff.

Note that on your include path you have -L/usr/X11R6/lib before 
-L../libs.  It should be reversed.  I think this is a bug in the 
makefile.

It is finding the installed libfvwm.a before it finds the newly 
compiled ones.

I've had a similar problem on SunOS systems running 1.24r.  I don't
know what this problem is, but it does not manifest itself with other
window managers on the same OS.  I am nervous about moving to the
latest 2.xx release until I understand this problem.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 
--------------------
In my .xsession file, I invoke my window manager in the background. (I
put the window manager in the background, so that from the xterm
session, I can change my window manager as needed.)  The last line in
the .xsession file is a foreground xterm process.  I expect that when
I exit my xterm process, the .xsession script will complete and the
window manager process will be killed.  (Is this because the
controlling terminal is terminated? Is this an incorrect assumption?)
This is the behavior I experienced on Motorola's SYS5.3 and SYS5.4
UNIX operating systems when using mwm, twm, tvtwm, and fvwm.

Recently, I've changed my home system to a SunOS machine and kept my
.xsession file.  I've compiled fvwm (1.24r) and I use that as my
window manager.  SOMETIMES, when I logout and login again quickly, I
get multiple fvwm processes.  One process is controlling my X session
ok, the others are competing and consuming about 90% of the CPU.

DIAGNOSIS:
----------
Unknown. 

I don't know what is causing this.  (Is it an operating system issue
or fvwm issue?)  It does not seem to happen with other window
managers, but I don't know for sure, because it is hard to reproduce.

WORK AROUND:
------------
I still put my window manager (fvwm) in the background, but at the end
of my .xsession, I put a wait call.  This causes the .xsession script
to wait for all background processes to complete, before terminating.
This forces me to use a menu to kill fvwm.  This is how I've kept from
having multiple fvwm processes hanging around and keeping my
co-workers from blaming fvwm.

Any ideas?

Hi,

This list sure has been dead.  I have not recieved a post in quite a while.

I know what I am asking is not a topic for this list, but I do not know 
where else to go.  I need to get a precompiled version of GNU gcc and 
binutils for the Sparc Solaris 2.5 Operating System (Solaris does not come 
with it's own compiler - you have to get it extra!).  Can anyone out there 
give me a hand?  Thanks in advance.

Any help would be appreciated thanks.

Hi,

Sometimes I just don't know when to keep my big mouth shut, (and I've
only just wiped away the egg on face from "undefined references"), 
but .....

Having got 2.0.42 up and running I can seem to get rid of the following
error ....

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2
PixmapPath

Obviously, there is not a module called, "PixmapPath".

It's not my .fvwmrc2 either. I get the same with the supplied
system.fvwmrc.

Clues ????

Clive.

Hi Guys,

I have intensively tried installing version 2.0.42
on a DecStation 600 under OSF/1 Version 3.2.
Compiler: gcc version 2.7.2. 
Neither is it possible to resize the windows
nor are there any pop-up-menus. I tried with 
and without xdm.

So long

A logic error in the sample.fvwmrc Imakefile causes the sample makefile
to be included even if you say "NO" to the option  i.e.

#define InstallSample NO 

sample.fvwmrc/Imakefile was

#ifdef InstallSample
InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
#endif

which if InstallSample was  YES or NO would install the sample

and should be:

#if InstallSample == YES
InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
#endif

Hi All!  

I'm not much of a C programmer (I had an intro course last year), but I was
intrigued by the pixmap titlebar patch.  I applied it and it worked without 
much event, but I found that I wanted a small pixmap tiled instead of a really
big pixmap across the whole thing.  So knowing that I should know better, I 
hacked Andrew's otherwise nice source and came up with this.  I seem to 
recall somebody requesting this...

Its only a modification of borders.c where you actually put the pixmap 
onto the titlebar. 

I'm not too familiar with the layout of the sources, so I didn't attempt
to #ifdef or change anything in the TitleStyle.  Its really a dirty hack
and I apologize in advance for it...

Hi,
I've just started using fvwm2 and so far, it behaves pretty much the
same as fvwm 1.x, but one thing bugs me - I can't get the 
icons to be placed on the bottom, left to right, as I'm used to with
fvwm 1.24.

In my old fvwm file (.fvwmrc) I have this, which works:

  IconBox   5 -64 -140 -5

So I put this in .fvwm2rc:

   Style "*"  DecorateTransient,IconBox 5 -64 -140 -5

But I still get the icons in the top left in one desktop and on the
top right on another. Is fvwm2 trying to avoid placing the icons on
any window? If so, can this behavior be overridden?

Thanks,
     Amir

BTW, my configuration is:
fvwm  2.0.42 with the title-bar-icon patch
xpm   3.4h
SunOS 4.1.4
MIT   X11R5

I've complained earlier that I can't make fvwm 2 place the icons in
the bottom left corener of my screen. To add insult to injury, after
I manullay moved the icons to where I want them, restarting fvwm
causes them to revert to the top-left corner of the screen, all of
them on the same spot.
Help !!!! (:-)

I've complained earlier that I can't make fvwm 2 place the icons in
the bottom left corener of my screen. To add insult to injury, after
I manullay moved the icons to where I want them, restarting fvwm
causes them to revert to the top-left corner of the screen, all of
them on the same spot.
Help !!!! (:-)

I got several replies and thanks to all, especially Harley Privitera
for pointing me in the right direction.

If FvwmCompiler flags is defined in Fvwm.tmpl. ie.

#define FvwmCompilerFlags -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -m486

then later in Fvwm.tmpl .....

#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags

overrides the CFLAGS def in the xmkmf generated Makefiles ....

CFLAGS = $(CDEBUGFLAGS) $(CCOPTIONS) $(THREADS_CFLAGS) $(ALLDEFINES)
                                                      
and consequently because 

ALLDEFINES = $(ALLINCLUDES) $(STD_DEFINES) $(EXTRA_DEFINES) \
$(PROTO_DEFINES) $(THREADS_DEFINES) $(DEFINES)

and

DEFINES = $(OPTION_DEFINES) $(XPM_DEFINES) $(AUDIO_DEFINES)

the necessary defs and includes are not included/defined.

Fvwm.tmpl should change to ...

#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CDEBUGFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags

I have narrowed the problem down.  The only windows that get cycled are ones
that have received focus since fvwm2 was started or restarted.   Also, the
order of cycling changes when you use the mouse to give a window focus. I
personally would prefer the order to remain constant and predictable.

Works fine, great even.  The current version of FvwmAuto raises a
window when a window receives focus, so they work together well. The
only strange thing is that SloppyFocus is in effect even though not
specified.  This is ok because it is how one would expect ClickToFocus
to work: You click on a window to change focus.

Yup, that is it!  It seems to be related to the problem the other person had
with thier icon box not working.  It seems that fvwm2 always put icons at 0,0
until something happens.  I have an app that I start iconified at a specific
location.  It starts at 0,0 until I expose it.

Yeah, I'll have to look into this...  It's still not quite right,

Actually what I meant was that ClickToFocus should already be raising
the windows when you click in them, without the help of FvwmAuto.

I dropped your style line into FvwmTalk and recaptured the windows and
it worked just fine.

Do you have an iconGeometry resource set up in your .Xdefaults?  That
might explain this behavior.

copy the sample .fvwm2rc file to ~/.fvwm2rc.  Fvwm2 doesn't currently
read the installed system.fvwm2rc, but this will be rectified for the

Yeah, PixmapPath tells where to look for XPM files, but if you don't
compile w/ XPM support, it removes PixmapPath from the builtin
functions list.  I need to fix this (simple fix actually) and will do
so for the next release.

I guess that  explains what I  observed.  I start "cm" (Sun's calendar
manager) iconified.   During a restart it gets  stuck  at 0,0 unless I
click on   it.   Putting an    icon-title on  the icon    "fixes"  it.
Ie. something has to happen to an iconified  window in order for it to
take its correct position  during  start or restart, including  things
like putting a title on the icon.

Hi Chuck,

thanks for advising. I'll try it.
 
There is something else. gcc does not
currently recognize the -Olimit 2000 option. 
So one has to remove this via shell-script
from all Makefiles. I mean, if you have
a better idea, please let me know. 

Ok and thanks again

			Martin

Well, the fact that Next and Prev behave the way they do was one of
the two reasons for me to choose this window manager!  Therefore,
Chuck will lose a happy user if he changes the fact that Next and Prev
dynamically reorder the window list based on which windows have
received focus recently.

I use the Prev command a lot to go the window I was using before.  In

I misspoke somewhat.  This aspect of the behavior is correct, but I
think there needs to be a way to get to ALL of the windows as well.
That's really what I would like to add/fix.

And I wouldn't want to loose any happy users...

Thanks for not mentioning that.  ;^)

When I first switched to fvwm2, the first app that I ran into this problem
with was also "cm".  Coincidence, huh?

I worked around it by letting fvwm place the icon instead of
specifying an icon position to the program.  That is, if you always want your
icon in the same place, try removing the command-line parameters (-WP or
something like that) that tell cm where to put its icon, and create an
IconBox just for cm that's barely big enough to hold the icon.

That "fixed" the problem for me.

You have a good point. Perhaps an option to allow fixed ordering.  Barring
such an option, I would say that the current method is best. Provided that
the cycling goes around the top (or bottom) instead of dead-ending. 
Microsloth (shudder) also goes around the end.

Actually, the problem is there with all Openwin programs that specify the location
of the icon.  I click on the icon and it pops to its correct location.  This
is in v2.0.41c.  I saw some mention in 42 about it accepting Openwin hints
like it does mwm.  I wonder if this option would fix the problem?

Just tried with 'Style "*" OLDecor' and fvwm 2.0.42.

That does not fix the problem.

GNU/FSF sites have a precompiled binary of the gcc compiler for Solaris.  
I've used it to rebuild the compiler under Solaris 2.3....I would suppose 
it will also work under 2.5.  The binaries can be found at the following 
sites:

ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/GNU/sparc-sun-solaris2/gcc-binaries-2.5.6.tar.gz
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/......

You also might need the gzip binaries found there.  I believe the 
instructions that come with this package will tell you what you need to 
do to re-compile the latest compiler (gcc-2.7.2.tar.gz).  I did not 
require anything additional out of binutils....everything else I needed 
was installed with Solaris.

I got fvwm95-2 from ftp.freebsd.org yesterday and installed it
and got it working at one point with the virtual desktop but then
I got so excited I thought I would try to fix it so I could get the win95
bottom taskbar working. But that was a dumb idea cause since then
I haven't been able to get the virtual desktop back. It keeps complaining
about "libc.so.3.0". Does anybody know what package libc.so.3.0 belongs
to?

the replacement for this function is a char array called:

char * sys_errlist[errno]

where errno is the index into the list of error strings


its seems that strerror is only used once in a file builtins.c in the function:
void exec_function(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,unsigned long context,char
*action, int *Module)

First, place       char *sys_errlist[];        as a global variable

I replaced the commented out line with the line below it

  if (!(fork())) /* child process */
  {
    if (execl(exec_shell_name, exec_shell_name, "-c", cmd, NULL)==-1)
    {
/* commented out till sys_errlist[] is figured out */
/*      fvwm_msg(ERR,"exec_function","execl failed (%s)",strerror(errno)); */
      fvwm_msg(ERR,"exec_function","execl failed (%s)",sys_errlist[errno]);
      exit(100);
    }
  }

I'm not sure how you'd want to implement this since its probably a SunOS implementation
problem only so if there is any #define that determines the type of system a person has then
that might be useful.

for more information on sys_errlist in SunOs: man sys_errlist

Ok, figured out what the problem is w/ the no rc file startup problem,
thanks to Keith Carter (I think that's who it was) describing it's
behavior slightly differently.  It triggered a little thought in my
head, and the problem was then easy to find.  It'll be fixed in the
next release.

Here's the patch, in case anyone is interested.  It should apply ok
against 2.0.42.

You could also try:

which has a bunch of binaries in Solaris package format.

That's the libc that comes along with your OS (FreeBSD?). do a 
   ldd `which fvwm95` (or whatever the fvwm95 executable is called) 
It should report being linked against libc.so.3.0
Now search thru /usr/lib  and see what versions of libc you have.

Why doesn't the Pixmap Titbar patch auto repeat the pattern.  In order
to use it, I need to have the pixmaps as wide as the widest window
I'll ever have, and this seems silly if the pattern will just be repeating.

The next version will (and more).  Someone I think posted a patch to
do this, but I will probably try to accomplish the same thing with
native X calls instead. 

I am planning to do some changes which will shorten the code quite a
bit.

I have noticed a problem with the menus specified in .fvwmrc (I've got
the rename fvwm2 bit turned off). It looks as if this was a change from
2.0.41 to 2.0.42

Here are two lines from my .fvwmrc under my Utilities menu:

+                       "Emacs"         Exec exec emacs &
+                       "Emacs"         Exec  exec emacs &

The first line pulls up emacs as expected, the second one does nothing.
Note the two spaces between Exec and exec on the second line.

Has anyone else noticed this ?

I'm writing a Python/Tk app which creates a small window and then
recognizes pen input (mouse input with button1 down, basically) in
that window as characters.  What I want is for those characters to
be sent to the currently active window.

It seems like the easiest way to do this would be to write it as
a fvwm module, using the packets from fvwm to keep track of what's
active, and sending commands back to fvwm to tell it to send the
keystrokes to whichever window.

It looks like a) there currently is no builtin command to send a 
keystroke to a window, so b) I can't do it this way, even though
c) writing such a builtin should be fairly simple (but also most
likely beyond my C and X skills.)

However, I am a horrible newbie at all this.  I would greatly 
appreciate it if someone with more of a clue could confirm or 
refute the above, or offer any other suggestions.  Thanks.

Alan

Hello,

I've encountered a peculiar problem in compiling and running fvwm 2.0.42:

For some reason, setPixmapPath (PixmapPath directive) does NOT get compiled
into the code (even though XPM _is_ defined) and, as a result, fvwm
reports that "PixmapPath - no such module" or words to that effect.

Xpmroot runs perfectly, enabling setPixmapPath in builtins.c by hand allws
the thing to compile and run WITHOUT the error - but PixmapPath is 
ignored and no XPM icons are available. This is NOT a tragedy, but has
anyone seen such a problem?

Thanks in advance,

Marc

does it make sense to have C-c or C-d kill fvwm, if there is no more
client? 
(so even if the focus is on a stack of xbiffs / other useless windows, and
you've no xterm or xemacs :-), you could exit/logout by repeatedly pressing
C-d or C-c or sth like that.

sorry, no idea about this one.

You probably compiled without XPM support.  I'm going to make it
handle this more gracefully for the next beta release.

It looks like your Imake setup is incomplete (missing files).  Someone
else reported a similar problem to the fvwm mailing list not too long
ago after upgrading XFree86 as well.

I'm not sure why they are missing - perhaps that other person would be
of more help.

Hm.  Another problem w/ me automatically putting the exec in there...
Apparently execess whitespace isn't stripped there, so it's sticking
an extra 'exec' in to the invocation, which is why it's not working.

I really have to either back out that exec change I made, or come up
w/ a better way to handle it for the next release.

Several people have reported problems like this, although they weren't
claiming to be defining XPM...

So, what I'm guessing that you are setting FvwmCompiler and
FvwmCompilerFlags, correct?  If so, it's probably my screwup w/
FvwmCompilerFlags that is causing problems here.

Change this in Fvwm.tmpl:


#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags
#endif

which may be causing -Ddefines to be lost, to:

#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CDEBUGFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags
#endif

then remake the makefiles & rebuild and see if that works better.

It's on my TO-DO list:

  - Add NeverFocus style?  Better - make sure fvwm handles all 4 focus
    states from the ICCCM (I don't think it handles a certain one of
    them correctly) and then make style parms to make fvwm able to
    treat windows like they are any one of these styles, even if the
    programs didn't set themselves up that way....

The 4 types are:

  No Input - won't ever get focus
  Passive  - won't get focus initially, but can get it later
  Locally Active  - can get focus initially, and get it later
  Globally Active - can get focus, but won't take it away
                    from other windows later (used for scrollbars,
                    etc)

Not the greatest translation of the ICCCM, but it'll do in a pinch.
Fvwm handles No Input (unless Lenience set), Locally Active, and
Globally Active just fine I believe, but I don't think that Passive
does.  So, I'd like to make it handle that, and then add a way to make
fvwm treat windows as being No Input or Passive via Style directives.

Sorry about that stupid posting. I was sure I uncommented the HasXpm
line but I use the wrong Fvwm.tmpl file.

Sorry about that...

One feature I'd like to see added to the pixmap capability is to be
able to specify I'd like the pixmap justified left or right in the
title bar instead of centered.  Its impossible to achieve this
in any other way, since it would continually depend on the size of
the window.

To be fair, you need to add in the cost of the "optional"FvwmPager and
GoodStuff/FvwmButtons modules. For 1.24r, I see, using top: 

  PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE   RES STATE     TIME   WCPU      CPU COMMAND
83558 jxt       61    0  535K  504K run       0:03   0.31%   1.59% fvwm 21797 
21797 jxt       60    0  201K  224K sleep     0:00   0.03%   0.20% FvwmPager
43405 jxt       60    0  272K  132K sleep     0:00   0.02%   0.20% GoodStuff

Using AIX's ucb-style ps, I see:

USER        PID %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS    TTY STAT    STIME  TIME COMMAND
jxt       21797  0.0  0.0  172  228      - S    11:53:05  0:00 FvwmPager
jxt       43405  0.0  0.0  220  132      - S    11:52:47  0:00 GoodStuff
jxt       83558  0.0  0.0  384  508      - S    11:52:41  0:03 fvwm 

Anybody know why top and ps don't agree? Just what exactly are "SIZE", 
"RES", "SZ", and "RSS"?

I don't agree.  I don't think that it's necessary to show them as an
answer to what was asked for the mere fact that they are optional
(note, no quotes).  I never use the FvwmButtons myself.  I do use the
pager (the only module I really use, actually), but if you're just
comparing window managers memory usage, you don't need to look at the
Pager since it only gives a visual interface to things that can be
easily bound to keys.

Now, for 1.24r you could compile it so the only pager is the external
pager module as well.  So, if 1.xx were compiled with the built in
pager then you could add the memory usage of the 2.x pager module into
the 2.x figures.  Still, it's just simpler to show the size difference
of the main fvwm2 modules.

It still takes a lot less than mwm and dtwm do, even with several
modules running and adding their amounts in.  The difference between
1.xx and 2.xx isn't that great (even with adding in the module sizes),
and I hope to be able to decrease the difference (or at least make
sure it doesn't increase any further).

>From AIX's InfoExplorer description for ps:

  SZ (-l, l)    The size in 1K-byte units of the core image of the
                process.
  SIZE (v)      Virtual size of the data section of the process (in
                1K-byte units).
  RSS (v)       Real-memory (resident set) size of the process (in
                1K-byte units).

RES isn't described, but I would assume that it is really RSS since
the values match in your example.

Hello,

First, I apologize for mail from a machine not subscribed to the list - 
our primary machine died :-).

Chris has, in one of his replies to me, sent a fix for the lack of
XPM support in fvwm-2.0.42. This fix (a change to the Fvwm.tmpl file)
works as advertised :-).

Alas, building the modules from the fvwm-2.0.42 directory does NOT
include XPM support in FvwmButtons (which promptly display what there
is to be displayed, MINUS icons). Changing to the FvwmButtons subdir
and issuing `make` there works and FvwmButtons works thereafter.

Shared library usage poses yet another problem in trying to compare
memory usage since, at least under Solaris, a process' size contains
the sizes of all the libraries used---regardless of whether they are
shared among other processes.

I'm content to use fvwm based solely on its features and active
development---not on whether it's less of a hog than mwm (which I
wouldn't use in any event). If I really cared about memory usage, I'll
probably run the decorationless nawm. Having said that, I do
appreciate the efforts to keep fvwm itself reasonably lean.

well one would want a window with -geom +0+0 to be placed at 0/0
(border edge!!!)
That means that the application pane has to be at
Borderwidth/Titleheight. If that is stored, that's a problem.



I always had the maybe related problem with 1.24, that my emacs is placed
slightly off-screen :
I had to specify    (left . -7) (top . 23)  as the geometry values for
emacs to get it in the top right corner.

I'm glad this was corrected in 2.xx (can't remember, but it's gone now.)
(identify says the geometry is +551-90, grrrrr)

anayway there's also that odd bug that -0-0 isn't done right 
(i.e: first converted to integer, so the "-" is lost resulting in 0/0
placement).

maybe these two could be taken care of together ?

albrecht

About a week ago I posted a patch for fvwm2.0.42 which added two functions
WarpToWindow and FocusOnly. Has anybody tried it out? Would anybody like to
see this put into fvwm? I've been using it since then, and it's been working
fine for me, and I'd like to see it in fvwm.

I've another question about this topic:
What would be the best and cleanest way for an application program
to determine the amount of window drift caused by the window manager ?
Since I am able to modify the application, I would like to try to avoid 
the drifting behaviuour described above using corrected 'x', 'y' values
in 'XCreateWindow'.

Yes, thats exactly the problem.
I posted the following to the list but for some reason it never made it
out ?????


If FvwmCompiler flags is defined in Fvwm.tmpl. ie.

#define FvwmCompilerFlags -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -m486

then later in Fvwm.tmpl .....

#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags

overrides the CFLAGS def in the xmkmf generated Makefiles ....

CFLAGS = $(CDEBUGFLAGS) $(CCOPTIONS) $(THREADS_CFLAGS) $(ALLDEFINES)
                                                      
and consequently because 

ALLDEFINES = $(ALLINCLUDES) $(STD_DEFINES) $(EXTRA_DEFINES) \
$(PROTO_DEFINES) $(THREADS_DEFINES) $(DEFINES)

and

DEFINES = $(OPTION_DEFINES) $(XPM_DEFINES) $(AUDIO_DEFINES)

the necessary defs and includes are not included/defined.

Fvwm.tmpl should change to ...

#ifdef FvwmCompilerFlags
        CDEBUGFLAGS = FvwmCompilerFlags

Back in March, I wrote:

} StubbornIcons seems to work only part of the time).

As long as I'm still waiting for these to show up :-) I thought I'd mention
that I figured out what makes StubbornIcons fail.

I use FvwmPager swallowed by GoodStuff, rather than the builtin pager, and
I have the following settings in .fvwmrc:

# press arrow + control + meta anywhere, and scroll by 1 desk
# (desks are arranged horizontally, so up/down just scroll)
Key Left	A	CM	Desk -1 0
Key Right	A	CM	Desk +1 0
Key Up		A	CM	Scroll +0 -100
Key Down	A	CM	Scroll +0 +100

Seems that whenever I change desks by using ctrl-meta-arrow, my icons lose
their stubbornness.  If I always change desks by mousing in the FvwmPager,
everything works fine.

Anybody have any idea why this happens?  Any suggested workarounds?

BTW, I noticed that my patch for fvwmrc_convert didn't make it into 2.0.42
(or at least it didn't get mentioned in the change log).  Oh, well.

I have noticed that when FvwmScroll causes a sticky window to be
scrolled then unscrolled that it looses it's stickiness.

Also, any hints on how to have a scrolled button bar inside a button bar?

I was playing around adding various pixmaps to my Window button and
found a few bugs. One, the PixmapPath doesn't appear to be followed for
loading xpms into the buttons. I had to hard code the path to the
pixmaps to get them to load. Also, I was experimenting by adding new
pixmaps with the FvwmTalk command line module and I filled up my colour
map. The only way I could get any colours back was by quitting fvwm.

Am I the only one using Robert Nation's rclock swallowed in FvwmButtons?
This clock had a cool feature when swallowed, with the old FvwmButton
module with a text string of junk. It would somehow replace the string
junk with the date, giving you date and time, as well as a biff
replacement in one app. Now, with the new FvwmButton module, I get the
string junk instead of the date. Can this be fixed?

I went ahead and delved into the sources, and got the following into Andrews
cool patch:

1) New Directive - PixmapJustify
                   It takes "Left", "Right", or "Center" 
		   (someone requested this and it wasn't difficult)

2) New Directive - PixmapTile
                   It doesn't take any arguements - by specifying it
                   you are saying "yes".  The code responsible for the
                   manipulations is the same as my previous patch.  This
                   overrides PixmapJustify.

The documentation on these new ones is missing, so save this e-mail!

So your .fvwm2rc will have a line (or three) resembling this:

TitleStyle flat leftjustified ActivePixmapUp denim.xpm ActivePixmapDown smiley.x
pm

The patch itself is uuencoded, gziped, in context diff form (my thanks to
Lars Wirzenius for helping me figure diff out).  It includes everything
that Andrew's did, except the changes in documentation and a couple of
very small changes in the flow.

If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then Andrew should 
consider himself sincerely flattered =]  Thank you a LOT, because without
your patch I'd have never started.

Any other suggestions?  Would people be intrested in a pixmap tiled around
the border?  It'd be a lot of work, but I'm learning tons by doing these.

Anyway, lemme know what you think!

I don't know for sure what WarpToWindow does, but I assume that you use

	WarpToWindow <window>

to go to window.  If that is the case,

	Next [<window>] Focus

does the same thing.  Is this what WarpToWindow does?

What does FocusOnly do?

This might be something to look into in the pixmap cache...

(I have a Linux/ELF system). I'm having trouble with getting fvwm
2.0.4[12] (I upgraded my system just recently, so I haven't tried any
of the earlier betas with it) to work with pixmaps. I have defined
"HasXpm YES" in Fvwm.tmpl and get no errors while
building. The xpm library seems to be linked into the binary:

20:49:35 ~>ldd /usr/X11/bin/fvwm2 
        libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.7
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6.0
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.0
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.2.18

However, there are no icons on screen (well, no pixmaps; bitmaps work
fine), no pixmaps in FvwmButtons and no pixmaps in titlebar buttons. The
xpmroot program that is built at the same time works just fine, and so do
all other programs that use pixmaps. I have tried both relying on
PixmapPath and using full pathnames.

Oh, and when I put into the menu definitions a line like this: 
+		"Xterm*xterm.xpm*" Exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -r -aw -rw +sb
-sl 500 -j -ls -fn 7x14 &
The entry shows as "Xterm*xterm.xpm*" (without the quotation marks). I'm
not sure if this is related to the other problem.

So, what am I doing wrong?

I've been wanting to do this for a while (no time right now), and I
have some concrete ideas for optimizing the pixmap button code (to
make it more flexible and smaller).

My next title bar patch will contain the something similar (probably
syntactically very similar), however the implementation will be using
the new code features (also want to use more native X features).

I also have some other features I will be working on for future
patches.

Have fun!

NOOOOOOO!!!!! Sorry, just kidding.

FocusOnly is a function which gives a window focus WITHOUT warping the cursor.
WarpToWindow is a function which warps the cursor to a window. The two of them
together could be used to replace the current Focus function, and that way we
could have a focus function which doesn't warp the cursor. 

Incidentally, I'm not sure that Next[<window>] Focus warps the cursor if
you're using ClickToFocus. If you're using one of the focus follows mouse
modes, then WarpToWindow does set the focus to that window as well.

Oh well, these things happen when you're a bit too tired; I forgot to
mention that it actually complains about having no Xpm support.

This is a (revised :-) patch collection, to fix probrems in 2.0.42 (no
feature enhancement is included). This patch fixes:

	* some fixes to imake environment.
	* avoid to use installed fvwm library.
	* compilation problems which related to BSD/OS 2.x.
	* avoid to use strerror() when SunOS 4.x.
	* trouble of 'no configfile exists'.
	* some manual typos.
	* mapping probrem when deiconify.
	* portability/compilation fix to FvwmForm.
	* FvwmIconMan should use GetFdWidth() instead of sysconf().

All of points are already reported to this list, or found by me. I
hope this patch helps people in trouble..

BTW, anybody have been verified the problem of "FvwmPager dies when
moving a window on a non-current desk to the current desk", reported
and fixed (?) by Mr. Nobutaka Suzuki ?

Is there a way to enable screen savers (using xlock) after a certain
amount of time in fvwm (still using version 1).

Also I'd like to map a keystroke to cycle through the open windows.
Can anyone give me some pointers on this one?  Thanks.

I use xautolock, which allows any arbitrary program to be run after some time
(usually xlock) and also allows the startup of the program if the mouse is

There are other programs as well, but I have found xautolock works best for
me.  I can't remember where I picked it up (it was before I started logging
all my software FTP's) but I think you might be able to find it at ftp.x.org.

If you do in fact have an ELF libXpm, do you have libXpm.so symlinked to
it? Does fvwm compile? If these are true, you may be running into the
problem I had, which is that fvwm seems to work with a limited number of
libXpm versions out there. I found that the latest ones of the 3.4
series don't work correctly, and earlier versions have a memory
allocation bug that shows up if you try to load a large xpm onto the
background with xpmroot. The only version I managed to work with that
has neither of these problems is Xpm3.4c, which I only found as aout for
Linux, and it was set up to create the old aout shared libraries.
However, it is trivial to compile your own shared libraries with ELF,
just read the ELF howto. I used 4.7 as a version number because 3.4
seems to have been used for the aout versions. All works well now, as
far as I can see.

Also, setvbuf() and waitpid() is also NOT exists. Followings is the

Have you tried xscreensaver written by Jamie Zawinski ?

It provides xlock and screensaver functionality all in one.

I use xautolock, which allows any arbitrary program to be run after some 
time
(usually xlock) and also allows the startup of the program if the mouse is
placed in a corner.

There are other programs as well, but I have found xautolock works best for
me.  I can't remember where I picked it up (it was before I started logging
all my software FTP's) but I think you might be able to find it at 
ftp.x.org.

Yes and yes. In fact, I recompiled fvwm and the problems have
disappeared. I have no idea at all why it didn't work the first time
but works now. The first time I compiled it I made a debian package
out of it, but I can't see how it could have caused the strange
behaviour. The default debian packaging script calls make with the
option LDFLAGS=-s, but the fvwm makefile doesn't use a variable called
LDFLAGS. So AFAIK that shouldn't cause any problems. (Well, I don't
know it the -s option would be a problem, as the explanation on the
manpage doesn't tell me much.)

But at least fvwm works now, so I'm not complaining :).

I have an idea for a useful function.  It is a slight modification to
what Next [*] Focus does.  As a refresher, Next [*] Focus transfers
focus to the next window, leaving the order unchanged.

The idea I have is for a function (FlipFocus) that switches the order.
It could be used to flip back and forth between to windows using a
single key.  I do this constantly, and currently have to remember
whether to use Next or Prev.

Does anyone else think this would be useful?  If so, I could implement it
and post a patch.

How should the function be invoked?  Invoking it as Next [*] FlipFocus would
work (theoretically), but then what would FlipFocus do when called as just
FlipFocus?

Comments? Suggestions?

Perhaps the more general solution is a function Flip, and you could use it to
do things besides focus.

Maybe what I am about to say will doom this potential idea forever, 
but isn't that similar to what microsoft DOS window in windows does?  
Alt-Tab?  

I like that functionality in windows, it enables me to switch between 
multiple applications fairly easily, providing focus (and 
deiconifying if necessary).

Would you just change the focus?  or would you also do warping?  What 
about iconification?  It is probably worth while giving it a try.   
(of course, its not my time I'm talking about spending :-)

What besides Focus would you want to flip?  I can't think of anything, but
then I don't do things the same as everyone else.  What would happen if
this generic Flip were invoked with options?

How about just a function `Last <Function>'?  This could sort of
switch the first (last) two windows on the list that Next/Prev use;
plus actually executing the <Function> with the window that comes out.
I have no idea how to do this, though, I can't do X programming.

Well, sort of.  In Windoze, hitting Alt-Tab and releasing has this affect. 
To cycle through windows, you hold down Alt and hit Tab repeatedly.

I like that one teensy little aspect of Windoze too.

The problem with changing Focus is then how do we cycle through all windows?
I do not think that it is possible to implement the holding down a modifier
key and repeatedly hitting a key strategy in X.  Am I wrong? I have not
heard of anyone implementing this.

I could imagine "Flip Raise" or "Flip RaiseLower" or "Flip Iconify".
"Flip RaiseLower" might be useful if you have, say, and editor and a
previewing window which partly obstructs the editor window when
raised.  You could then use "Flip RaiseLower" to raise the preview
window to look at it, then lower it again to continue editing.

Well, I don't want to flip anything. But, I could see people using this to
raise/lower windows, or maybe some compound function. It wouldn't make the
code any larger or more compilicated to make it general, and I'm sure somebody
would figure out a use for it, so it just seems like a good idea.

Ok, the concensus is that this would be useful.  Now, for the exact
implementation.

People have expressed that it would be desirable to use Flip to raise
a window using Raise/Lower/RaiseLower.  This can be done using 
Next [*] RaiseLower.  RaiseLower does not change the Foucs (Scr.Focus), 
so the next call to Next [*] RaiseLower would affect the same window
as the first one.  As far as I know, Focus is the only thing that modifies
the value of Scr.Focus.  If that is the case, it seems to me that Focus
is the only thing that makes sense when used with Flip.  If someone
familiar with the source can correct me, please do.

Personally, I like the way Windoze handles it.  I do not believe that it
is possible to implement this in X.  If anyone has any ideas on how this
might be done, please let me know.

If my assumptions are correct, I will create a function called FlipFocus.
This function will do two things:

1) Flip the currently focused window the the indicated window in the window 
   list.  If the window list is A-B-C-D-E-F, the currently focused window
   is B, and the indicated window is E, the new window list would be
   A-E-C-D-B-F. 

2) Set Focus to the indicated window (E in the example above).

I have the following in my .fvwm2rc and it works just dandy for
cycling through all windows.  Of course, here we're talking about just
switching to the last window used, so this is a little different.  But
nonetheless...

With FocusFollowsMouse or SloppyFocus, deiconifying or raising a
window can mean a change of focus.  Or moving a window, for that
matter.

There is an unresolved reference to strerror() in builtins.c on SunOs (I am
using SunOs 4.1.4 but I believe that this problem will occur on other
versions as well). My fix was to add the following lines to the top of the
file:

#if defined __sun__ && !defined SYSV
extern char *sys_errlist[] ;
#define strerror(err)   sys_errlist[err]
#endif

This is not ideal because garbage error code may cause core dumps. A function
which does boundary checking would be better, however it should be OK for most
cases.

FlipFocus is done.  The patch (68 lines) is at the end of this note.

To try out FlipFocus, I recommend something like:

Key F8	A	N	Prev [CurrentScreen] FlipFocus
Key F8	A	S	Prev [CurrentScreen] Focus

Send me, or this group, some email to say how you like it.

With no further delay, here it is.

I have the lastest fvwm on my DEC Alpha running Digital UNIX (OSF/1).

I am also running tkgoodstuff w/ fvwm.  In this tkgoodstuff I am running 
the fvwm pager.  The problem is I cannot use the mouse to switch virtual 
screens i can use like control-next, control-prev to advance it but, the 
mouse doesn't switch the screens.  I tried using FvwmConfig to fix this, 
and I added the line Read .fvwm-config in my .fvwm2rc file.  FvwmConfig 
doesn't seem to save the virtual information in it's file.  Any 
suggestions, thanks.

Arnon; This is not ideal because garbage error code may cause core dumps. A function
Arnon; which does boundary checking would be better, however it should be OK for most

Another potenial problem with this workaround is that the
sys_errlist array may be smaller than 'err' elements.
To quote from the SunOS man page of perror() function:
...
     int sys_nerr;
     char *sys_errlist[];
     int errno;
...
"To simplify variant formatting of messages,  the  vector  of
     message  strings  sys_errlist is provided; errno can be used
     as an index in this table to get the message string  without
     the  newline.   sys_nerr  is the number of messages provided
     for in the table; it should be  checked  because  new  error
     codes  may  be  added to the system before they are added to
     the table."

So the correct fix (IMHO) would be:

#if defined __sun__ && !defined SYSV
extern char *sys_errlist[] ;
extern int  sys_nerr;

#define strerror(err)  \
   (err < sys_nerr) ? sys_errlist[err] : sprintf ("Unknown errno %d", err)
#endif

An alternative (that I use) is: if you have Sun's SPARCompiler, you
can still compile with gcc, just add the libansi.a library to the link:
It's in <path>/SC3.0.1/lib/libansi.a

I'm currently using fvwm 2.0.41. In the 1.xx version xterm worked
fine - as much as I needed at least.

In this version I am having trouble with function key 10. I just can't
get it mapped, programmed, anything.... Is this a known problem?
Is there a known fix?

Should I go to 2.0.42?

I'm using Linux 1.2.13 from slackware.

my errno.h doesn't even declare sys_errlist[] and sys_nerr

And that sprintf needs a character buffer to construct the result in, as a
first argument!!!!

and sun_headers.h should be included in builtins.c

sun_headers should have:

extern char *sys_errlist[];
extern int sys_nerr;

#define strerror(err) ((err < sys_nerr) ? sys_errlist[err] : "Unknown errno")

my 2.0.41 man page says:
	StartIconic/StartNormal

I'd like StartMaximized (but with the arguments, since I always want my
buttonbar with console and pager visible.)

On second thought: why not allow a style element like Start AnyFunction

Start Iconify would be the same as StartIconic.


my first use of this:

Style "viewdraw" start PowerViewStartup

Function PowerViewStartup Maximize 100 94
+		MapWindow 0 1 3 2
+		Desk 0 1
+		GotoPage 3 2

Note: MapWindow is also new: it maps a window to a specific desk (first two
arguments) / page (3rd and 4th argument)

if there is no Start Function or no MapWindow directive in there, 
MapWindow 1 0 would be default.


Note: PowerView is a layout program, and it doesn't make any sense to have
any other window on the same page :-) - even a 20" monitor would just
suffice - and I'm hooked on 16" :-(

would smash two birds with one stone :-)

PS: chuck: I know it's rahter late for a change, but could the interfaces
of Desk and GotoPage be unified ?

what we need is a simple way to specify absolute/ relative adressing for
BOTH. (Page too)

I have to look the man page up EVERY time I use the Desk command, which I'd
count as an indicator, that it's not very intuitive (to say the least IMHO).

I'd suggest 
sth like
	GotoDesk z
	GotoDesk +z
	GotoDesk -z
and
	GotoPage x y
	GotoPage +x +y
or have a single command
	
	DeskPage +/-z +/-x +/-y

I think the code would be even shorter and much more general.

Then you'd naturally use the same specification for MapWindow +/-z +/-x +/-y
with default mapping of MapWindow +0 +0 +0

One more vote for a unified Goto function with simplifed syntax.  

Also, there is currently (at least not documented) way to have a window 
start on a different page.  So a unified StartsOn would be great.  At the
very least, a StartsOnPage would be very nice.

PS: Chuck: I will gladly develope the Goto function if you, or someone else,
have not already begun work on it.

I had to change the line 
        MANPATH = FvwmManPath
to
        MANDIR = FvwmManPath
to be able to install the man pages in a local tree.

MANPATH is set from FvwmManPath which I was asked to set:

	/* Where do you want the fvwm man pages installed. */
	/* #define FvwmManPath /usr/local/X11R6/man */

but MANPATH isn't used by the install process: MANDIR is used.
(which is only defined in some system global file)

I'm having trouble compiling the new release of fvwm, the error I get is shown
below. I don't think that there is anything wrong with my setup, I have compiled
and used Fvwm for a long time now.
The error seems to be in the fvwmlib.h file, did I miss a patch or simple fix while
I was away for a week?

The libraries and so on *are* all there, why aren't they picked up on by Imake
when they were before? Solaris 2.5, usual setup, nothing strange.

Thanks for any help.

Hmm.  Since tkgoodstuff can't "swallow" the FvwmPager, perhaps you are
using tkgoodstuff's Pager client?  If the problem is with tkgoodstuff,
which version of tkgoodstuff are you using?

I haven't heard of this problem with tkgoodstuff's pager; but I'd be
happy to help you debug it if you send me details.  Which version of
tkgoodstuff are you using?  Does the tkgoodstuff pager correctly track
which virtual screen you are on (the pager button corresponding to the
current page should become sunken) and which screens have windows on
them (the corresponding button should be blue).  I.e., I'm wondering
if the tkgoodstuff/fvwm interface is working for you at all.

There is the problem of 2.0.42 linking the global libfvwm before the
local (in ".").  You might want to switch the two -L arguments in the
Makefile or remove (rename?) the global libfvwm.

Does this do it?

Probably not a bad idea, but I don't think that the proposed syntax
would work for specifying relative moves, since desk numbers can have
neg numbers.  In other words, would GotoDesk -2 mean two desks
previous or the actual desk -2?

Perhaps something like the following would work better:

  Goto [Page x y | RelativePage dx dy] [Desk z | RelativeDesk dz]

Verbose, but no suprises.

I do have this in the TO-DO list already, but you can add multiples of

That is alot to type.  Perhaps have the possible invocations be:

	Goto x y z
	Goto x y
	Goto z
	Goto Relative x y z
	Goto Relative x y 
	Goto Relative z

So the summary would be ([] indicate optional inclusion):

	Goto [Relative] [x y] [z]

I will certainly give it a stab. :)  I would like your aproval on the
syntax before I begin.

Well, my suggestion is a little bit more to type, but it eliminates
confusion.  If you see:

  Goto 2 1 1

It's not obvious what page and desk you are going to, but seeing:

  Goto Page 2 1 Desk 1

is very explicit.  And you lose a little flexibilty.  With my
suggestion you could specify:

  Goto Page 1 1 RelativeDesk -3

Where yours would require 2 separate lines:

  Goto 1 1
  Goto Relative -3

So, I still prefer my syntax (but of course, I'm biased). :)

some things I found while upgrading to 2.0.42 (finally found the time)


I accidently wrote 
*FvwmButtonx (Swallow xclock "Exec xclock -geometry -1500-1500 -bg Grey -fg Black -padding 0")
and got a button with an x as the title, no icon, and every time I click,
fvwm outputs the errormessage: 
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /net/vta_host/home/vta_host/albr
echt/bin xclock


second: 
I had absolutely no luck swallowing "FvwmButton" in "FvwmButton FvwmSwallow"
	*FvwmSwallow(4x2, Swallow FvwmButtons FvwmButtons)

always crashes with obscure X errors about reparenting:

FvwmSwallow: Cause of next X Error.
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  0
  Resource id in failed request:  0x300003
  Serial number of failed request:  449
  Current serial number in output stream:  451
FvwmSwallow: Cause of next X Error.
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  7 (X_ReparentWindow)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  0
  Resource id in failed request:  0x300002
  Serial number of failed request:  105
  Current serial number in output stream:  108


I now use a container, but I didn't want to convert all my config at once.


also when I use
	*FvwmButtons (Icon toolbox.xpm,	Action "Menu Tools	Exec xlock -allowroot") 

I can't ever get the display to lock, while
	AddToFunc "DoorQuit"
	+	"Motion"	Exec exec @@
	+	"Click"		Quit

	*FvwmButtons (Icon Door.bmp,	Action "Function DoorQuit")
does work -double click kicks fvwm out of it's shoes :-)




And last but not least, I can't really say that NoKill/UseOld are working,
since when I restart fvwm2, the swallowed programs are still
killed/restarted. one example, to make sure it's not a
typo/misunderstanding: 

*FvwmButtons (Swallow (NoKill, UseOld) xbiff "Exec xbiff -geometry -1500-1500 -bg Grey -fg Black")

I have several XEmacs windows open, then I iconify a few.  When I
click on the icon label to deiconify one of the XEmacs windows, I get
some really weird behavior.  It seems like the window still has some
semblance of focus but it never updates the display.  The cursor gets
solidly filled, but for example hitting C-p or C-n doesn't move the
cursor.  I can tell things are happening though because if I hit a
keychord to save my Inbox, or kill the frame, those actions happen.  I
can pop up a new frame and that will work fine.  The update lossage
doesn't happen all the time so apologies for no recipe.

Has anyone else experienced this weird problem?  It never happened for
me with 1.24r.

StartMaximized would be excellent. Netscape ie. has this bad habit of
ignoring shamelesly the geometry specification and always start bigger
horizontaly than my desk. If I move netscapes window and press the maximize
button it resizes itself nicely. of course netscape sucks. but the function
would be nice....

Well, I have deleted my old libfvwm, but it makes no difference.
As for swapping the -L arguements, could you be a little more precise?

(I'm haven't a lot of free time to 'experiment' with it today, might as well
get a  definitive answer before recompiling!)

I had a glance at the makefile but wasn't sure:
	(a) What makefile are we talking about? The top level one, the one in /libs,
		all of them??
	(b) What line should I be changing, and what should I change it to?
		I had a quick look but it wasn't clear

Sorry if these are SQs! I'm not sure how the linkage affects this, it looks like
it just doesn't find some libraries, it doesn't get as far as linking (I think!).

The error is shown below again: (Solaris 2.5)

or maybe the more general approach of a start function, which can do

send FvwmButtons a command to swallow it
(imagine: "goto DeskRelative 1, Map" for CAD applications,
"*FvwmButtons swallow (useold) perfmeter nop" for perfmeters, alarms and so

RATS.

does anyone use negative desk numbers?
I know, desks are generated on the fly, but I really don't use this one, so
I can't say anything about it.

I'm rather satisfied with my single desk of 4x2 pages :-) (I prefer that to
more desks, since I change pages with the mouse most often, either crossing
borders, or clicking in the pager - which just shows my one desk)


the negative thingie also spoils my main argument for a combined/unified
interface: 
It isn't really an x/y/z address, which goes from the origin (0/0/0) to
(inf/inf/inf)

So if we unified the interface, would someone specify Page -3 -3 ?
what should happen in this case?

is it possible to also extend pages to +-inf ?
does it make any sense to have that many pages / desks?


Chuck> Perhaps something like the following would work better:

Chuck>   Goto [Page x y | RelativePage dx dy] [Desk z | RelativeDesk dz]

Dan> That is alot to type.  Perhaps have the possible invocations be:

I, too must say that I don't like this one very much.
	
well I'd also allow absolute rows /relative colums
   Goto [Page x y | RelativePage dx dy] [Desk z | RelativeDesk dz]


Dan> 	Goto x y z
Dan> 	Goto x y
Dan> 	Goto z
Dan> 	Goto Relative x y z
Dan> 	Goto Relative x y 
Dan> 	Goto Relative z

Dan> So the summary would be ([] indicate optional inclusion):

Dan> 	Goto [Relative] [x y] [z]

rather difficult: 
	one argument: desk only
	two arguments: page only,
	three arguments: desk and page ore page and desk 

(I say: the desk is the most significant "digit", but other minds will
vary!!!) It'd also not be too intuitive to have the first parameter be
sometimes page, sometimes desk, depending on the number of parameters.







to sum it up: we won't have a unified interface, which is easy to remember,
as long, as the functions are different. (I overlooked that, when I started
this thread.)

And they differ greatly in parameter space.
Maybe we should discuss that one first, as the above syntax suggestions are
mostly a rename / move to a Goto prefix.

First of all: does anyone use negative desk numbers (except by accident)
As far as I remember these just resulted from Rob using signed 32bit
integers for the desktop numbers. Was this intentional, Rob?

What if we changed that to unsigned to provide a unified parameter space
with +/- as the "relative" indicators (the analogy to geometry was somewhat
intentional, though I hadn't thought it all to the end) ?

In fact a window is positioned 
	on a desk
	on a page
	at a specific x/y position
	with a specific size.

the last two are out of reach (no one wants to change geometry), and also 
somewhat different in semantics.


that said, if we can't get the parameterspace/meaning uniform, I'd rather
stick with two variants of two different functions:

	Desk[Relative] z
and
	Page[Relative] x y
	
(where we could also use Page -1 -1 as in geometry -1 -1: specifying the
bottom rightmost page)


sorry this got that long,

cheers,

I got bitten by that myself.  My problem, however, was that I tried to
create a dynamic lib for fvwm, which worked fine until I decided to upgrade
and it looks for dynamic libs first then static ones.

This problem has nothing to do with linking.  gcc isn't finding
include files properly.  The X11 headers are usually found in
/usr/include/X11, and most compilers have this as a default search
location, I believe.  But you might want to find out exactly where
your X11 headers are and add an explicit '-I/usr/include' or wherever
the X11 header directory is to your cflags.  You can do this without
rerunning Imake:

  make CDEBUGFLAGS='-g -Wall -I/usr/include'

In the April 1996 issue of 'Sys Admin' (Volume 5, Number 4), there
is an article about fvwm entitled "Customizing X Window Sessions with fvwm."
It is written by Richard L. Brownrigg.

The article mentions Robert Nation and Charles Hines.  It talks about the
various features of fvwm.  The general feeling in the article is that
fvwm is a very useful window manager.

The only thing remotely negative said about fvwm was said in an insert panel.
This panel states that the desktop concept is not as useful as it could
be. He (Richard?) says that having different desktops use different
configurations, and different colormaps, would make it more usefull. He
says that as it stands, virtual desks add little to the virtual page concept.

Overall, the article was very positive. 

Congratulations Chuck! You are now (more) famous!

I have to agree with him, actually.  I don't use multiple desks
myself, just one big desktop.

The idea of having multiple colormaps (one per desk) has been
discussed here in the past, and would be great if it were truly
feasable, which it really isn't.  After all, how would you deal with
windows moving across desks?

I suppose this should be directed at Mr. Brownrigg.  Maybe he's on the
list?

Then he hasn't been opening enough windows :-)

I use a 3x3 desktop and until very recently only used a single desk.
However, on a recent project, I found I was opening more and more
windows.  I like to keep the number of windows per page as small as
possible to avoid overlap.  Sure, I could have edited my .fvwm2rc with
a different Desktop scheme, but that would mess up the mapping I have
between the keypad and GotoPage, not to mention having to restart.
Instead, I just moved to the next desk and bang - nine more pages, no
reconfiguration necessary.  I, for one, consider this to be a major
win.

I personally would vote for deletion of the negative virtual desk numbers.
To me, all it does is add confusion.  If 4 billion virtual desks are
really necessary, lets use an unsigned 32-bit int.

I have to agree. I for one usually work with a 3x1 implementation of FVWM.
I just recently moved to 4x1. I don't get too fancy, I just don't like
overlapping windows. If it hadn't have been for the virtual desktops, I
wouldn't kill myself trying to compile fvwm :) I would just stick with the
MWM on the system.

Did this go away?  I think it was there for 1.24r, but it seems like
rubberband resize is the only option for 2.0.42.

Am I understanding you correctly. Is it (sort-of) possible to have
private colormaps in effect for each desk (so one could say, stick the
netscape hog on one desk and still have plenty of color slots for
other apps that reside on other desks)? That would be a big win
(although it seems technically challenging to say the least).

Punt.

For those following the life of tkgoodstuff4.1...

I'm done with tkgoodstuff4.1b6, which means I'm starting b7, and hope
that this is the last beta (it'll go through patches before becoming
4.1, though).

Tcl7.5/tk4.1 has been released (ftp.smli.com), fvwm2 is not far from
release, and so I'd like to have something to release pretty soon.

I'd appreciate anyone who has needed to tweak the makefiles or
configure scripts for tkxpm and tkfvwm to let me know what you needed
to do.  A little work now might save me serious headaches after the
main release.  

As always, I very much appreciate your help.

The latest changes and bugfixes:

  - Gary Dezern contributes a TkMan client, which interfaces with the
  tkman man page viewer the way our WWW client interfaces with web
  browsers.  (Thanks!)

  - Thanks (a lot) to code from R. Angiel and G. Dezern, Biff now does
  new-message counting, handles multiple mailboxes, and handles MH
  much more correctly.  It's still "in transition", and I have ideas
  for enhancement (multiple buttons, and individually adjustable
  properties, including variable "alert levels", for different
  mailboxes) that will have to wait until I find or write a usable
  list-configuration thingy, but what is there now works in my use.

  - I had subtracted the option where Biff pops up a list of new mail
  on arrival, but now it's back in: you get a different popup for each
  mailbox. 

  - There are Win95-like additions to auto-minimize in full-screen
  mode and for dragging the (full-screen) panel from screen-edge to
  screen edge (as it stands, we have to restart if we go from vertical
  to horizontal or vice-versa).  There was a bug in the interaction
  between auto-minimize and subpanels, which I think I've killed or at
  least maimed, but I don't understand why it happened in the first
  place (see a comment in TKGPanelButtonInvoke if you'd like to do
  some bug detective work).

  - In Net, we now show connection up-time in the label (if any).
  This updates only as often as we check the net connection (by
  default, every 20 seconds).  What else would people like to see in
  Net?  

  - Somehow I had broken the Ical client's midnight update.  Fixed.

  - The response to errors in preferences or configuration is much
  improved, and you shouldn't lose all your config work over and over
  anymore (as often ;-|).

  - M. Beynon contributed patches for tkxpm, and the configure scripts
  were updated/streamlined.



The top of the CHANGES file:

4.1b6: (unreleased)

   - There is a new on-line preferences manager (so you don't have to
   edit the rc file by hand). Start up tkgoodstuff.  You will get a
   default configuration.  Select Preferences from the tkgoodstuff
   menu, and choose the "Configuration" section.  Here, add, delete or
   move Client, AddButton, AddLabelBox, stacking, and panel-creating
   commands.  Then, save the preferences and restart.  Now you can set
   using the preferences manager the things you used to have to adjust
   with variables.

   - tkgoodstuff: 

       + New options for icon scale and font scale (small or large).
       Also, where an iconfile is called for, you can specify
       "%biffnew" and tkgoodstuff will look, depending on whether the
       scale is small or large, for biffnew.xpm or biffnew-sm.xpm.

       + New option for standard padding inside buttons, etc.  Adjust
       to 0 for very busy but compact look, to 2 or 3 for more roomy
       look.

       + Now you can specify a pathlist of icon directories
       in the preferences manager.  You also can specify an icon that
       is somewhere in that path with just its name (full filenames
       work too).

       + In fullscreen mode, now you can "drag" the main border to
       move the panel to another edge of the screen.  It's a quick
       hack (if we go from horizontal to vertical or vice versa we
       save a changed fullscreen-side preference and restart
       tkgoodstuff), but nothing wouldn't be better.  We should really
       be able to do this on the fly (which means regridding, and
       resizing the auto-sized clients (Clock, Pager, Load).

       + Also there is a new option Auto-minimize which in fullscreen
       mode reduces tkgoodstuff to a line along the edge of the screen
       when the mouse leaves the tkgoodstuff panel.

       + Killed (I hope) bug without understanding why: sometimes in
       auto-minimize mode clicking on a panelbutton would cause an
       error whose entire stack trace is ("after" script).  Since
       removing an "update" command from TKGPanelButtonInvoke, I no
       longer see this problem.  Any speculations as to why would be
       welcome!

   - New Client: TkMan, by G. Dezern, interfaces with the tkman man
   page viewer the way our WWW client interfaces with web browsers.

   - WindowList: Shorten windownames before using scrollbar (patch
   from E. Kahler).

   - Biff: 
     + Mail-checking methods now work as advertised (thanks R. Angiel
     and G. Dezern).  I hope.
     + Optional on-button display of number of new messages (except
     for users of the mh method).  (Thanks R. Angiel.)
     + Display of new messages was too fancy, or not fancy enough, to
     work right; now we just display the entire header with the message.

   - Net:
     + Added elapsed-time-of-connection counter.
     + Deleted net-type from label.

   - Jots and Calc: respond sensibly to window manager DELETEs.

   - Icons: ruthless color-pruning.  Now the icons use colors from a
   palette of 19 colors, and tkgoodstuff's default widget colors are
   among them. 

   - tkxpm and tkfvwm: much tidier configure scripts (not using
   autoconf), relying on tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh.  Also, fvwm
   source is no longer needed to compile tkfvwm (libfvwm2.a is now
   installed at fvwm installation).  M. Beynon contributed bug fixes.

4.1b5: 2/27/96

  Now tkgoodstuff assumes tk4.1b1 or later (we're aiming at supporting
  the ultimate 4.1 release, and backward compatibility is too much
  work). 

     - tkgoodstuff: 

       + We use the grid geometry manager rather than pack for almost
       everything.  TKGPack is superseded by TKGGrid.  Had hoped that
       this would make fullscreen mode easier, but no.

       + Added subpanels which are formed with StartPanel and
       EndPanel, can be linked to a button with PanelButton, or placed
       on the screen at startup with PutPanel.  See the tkgoodstuffrc
       html docs for more.

       + Now xpm capability is mandatory.  I hope Ioi Lam's xpm image
       type will get in the core before our main 4.1 release.

       + "create-label-box" renamed to "TKGLabelBox".  NOTE!!!

       + AddButton and AddLabelBox no longer take a name as first
       argument.  NOTE!!!

       + Clock_zerotrim moved to tkgoodstuff and called TKGZeroTrim.

       + Use "ps -p [pid]" if "ps [pid]" gives an error, and don't
       assume there's a STAT column in the ps output (thanks
       J. Robinson).

       + Implement TKGAddToHook and TKGDoHook (general hook
       utilities).  Several hooks are defined (for client use) in
       tkgoodstuff, Fvwm.tcl, etc.

       + Change default fonts to non-italic, non-bold.

     - Biff: avoid tcl7.5b1's gets bugs by not doing "gets $f var".

     - New client "Pager" by Eric Kahler.  Check out the current
     version in this distribution.  Needs tkgoodstuff to be run as an
     fvwm module (from the fvwm window manager).

     - New client "Chooser" by Eric Kahler.  Pops up a window at
     startup to let you choose among different tkgoodstuff
     configuration files.

     - New client in "alpha" stage: Calc (dec/hex/oct calculator).
     Has paper-tape-like scrollable history.  Some features not
     implemented, but it's fairly usable.  I'm not inclined to develop
     this further right now, so I'd be very happy if someone were to
     adopt it.

     - New client in "beta" stage: Webster (net dictionary client).
     Pops up a definition of the word you highlight (the current X
     selection).  Can use unix "webster" command, but also has its own
     internal webster client code (using the new Tcl socket stuff,
     with a kludge required because Tcl strings can't yet contain
     NULLs).

     - The tkfvwm source is now included in the tkgoodstuff
     distribution.

     - The fvwm WindowList feature has become a client.  To call it,
     you now issue "Client WindowList".  It's become more robust too,
     I hope.  I also added a few default icons for shells, editors,
     mailers, newsreaders.  If it doesn't recognize your favorite
     apps of these types, please let me know the resource Class name,
     and the application type (e.g., "Xmh" is a mailer, "XTerm" is a
     shell). I'd be happy to have some graphically competent person revise
     these or submit other 11x11 icons.

     - Fvwm: fvwm's messages are more easily available to clients, we
     maintain a more complete database of the information available
     from fvwm, and we slightly enhanced tkfvwm (the new version of
     tkfvwm4.1 is needed to take advantage of all the information).
     Look at Fvwm.tcl for more info.  These changes were primarily to
     support WindowList and Eric Kahler's cool Pager client.

     - Clock, Ical, Jots: use the new "clock" command instead of "exec
     date". 

     - Ical: Gave one alarm per item per calendar fetch.  Oops.  Stick
     to one per item.

     - Jots: Made widgets behave sensibly under manual resizing (until
     tk4.1b1's empty-frame bug showed up, that is).

     - Net: (bug) call TKGButton, not TKGMakeButton, to change the
     text on a switch of net types.  Also, (feature removal) don't
     bind mouse <3> to change Net_type (too confusing for those who
     don't want it and don't want to know about it, and it's easy
     enough to change types with the popup menu).

(Earlier changes available on request.)

Actually, I started looking through the code.  It seems like -f and

In general, starting fvwm without -s does start an independent fvwm on
each screen.  So far so good!

But I've noticed more problems with dual headed support for fvwm2.
Focus doesn't always leave the window on screen 0 if I move the cursor
to screen 1.  I.e. even though the cursor is over the root window in
screen 1, all typing still goes to the last window in screen 0 that
had the focus (I think all events do this too).

In ctwm, which had pretty good dual head support, restarting on one
screen restarted them both.  Now, I'm not sure I mind the way fvwm
does it (they are restarted independently), but I would definitely
want the ability to manually start a separate 'fvwm -s' on each
screen.

I wish I was more of an X wiz so I could help out.  I can only feebly
suggest ripping as much as possible out of ctwm 3.3 since it did
really the best job of dual head support of any window manager I've
used.

Lots of set backs, but I hope I can post at least a minimal Python/Tk

...I usually want the same configuration on both screens, except when

It might be possible, but there is also a problem w/ fvwm needing a
colormap too, so the borders, menus, etc on desktops other than the
first one wouldn't look right (unless I did something really tricky
under the covers, like force the exact same entries fvwm needs in
every colormap, but that would probably only serve bloat and slow down
things).

That's why I don't think it is really feasable at all, that and what
to do with moving windows across desks...

Not enough of a win for the trouble, I think, especially since most
color hog programs can be told to install thier own colormaps (eg
'netscape -install').  And definitely technically challenging, I
think.

Perhaps I'll toy around with it some day in the future though, and see
if something semi-reasonable can't be done.

I haven't seen this particular problem, and I'm doing a lot of
restarting these days. :-)  It definitely happens to me when I
iconify/de-iconify but like you it's not very reproducible.  It only
seems to happen with XEmacs, but maybe it's just that I use those
windows more than anything else so I haven't noticed it with other
applications.

  Well, it's not exactly what you want, but I use:

ColormapFocus FollowsMouse

in my .fvwmrc and in my .Xresources:

Netscape.*installColormap:      Yes

That way netscape starts with its own colormap leaving colors for
all my other apps and icons.  The only annoyance is the colormap
flashing as you enter and leave the netscape window(s).

Agreed.  I would vote for more explicit syntax.

I don't actually use the beta version, I use one of the
old 1.23 releases. 

But the actual writing of the fvwmrc is not a big deal.
The use of any syntax which is more explicit, if a little
more verbose is to be commended. 

Having to try and figure out how fvwm might parse a command
or having to come back 6 months later to change a configuration
and having no idea what the hell it was doing really outweigh the
extra time taken to code the command in the first place.

I would also vote for the more explicit syntax. It is crystal clear
if not as concise as the other version.

Subject: FVWM: FVWM focus bug?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

I'm having a rather peculiar problem with FVWM (at least I think
it's fvwm's fault, since other window managers don't seem to
have a problem).  For some reason, the focus will never go onto a
program that I write.  I've tried setting 'Style "*" ClickToFocus'
and SloppyFocus.  Neither have any affect.  Whether I move the mouse
onto the window, select the window title bar, resize, whatever.

Here are the relevant files (a sample X program that has this problem,
and my ~/.fvwmrc file):

------------------------------------------------------
# Imakefile
PROGRAMS = xtest

SRCS1 = xtest.c 
OBJS1 = xtest.o

CCOPTIONS = -pedantic -Wall

LOCAL_LIBRARIES1 = $(XLIB) $(XTOOLLIB) $(XAWLIB) $(XMULIB) \
	-lm $(EXTRA_LDOPTIONS)
DEPLIBS1 = $(DEPXLIB) $(DEPXTOOLLIB) $(DEPXAWLIB) $(DEPXMULIB) 

ComplexProgramTarget_1(xtest,$(LOCAL_LIBRARIES1),)
------------------------------------------------------
/* xtest.c */
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>
#include <X11/Xaw/Command.h>

void cb_quit(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer call_data);

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	XtAppContext app_context;
	Widget toplevel, quit;
	toplevel = XtVaAppInitialize(&app_context,
		"Xtest", NULL, 0, &argc, argv, NULL, NULL);

	quit = XtCreateManagedWidget("quit", commandWidgetClass, 
		toplevel, 0, 0);
	XtAddCallback(quit, XtNcallback, cb_quit, NULL);

	XtRealizeWidget(toplevel);

	XtAppMainLoop(app_context);
	return(0);
}

void cb_quit(Widget w, XtPointer client_data, XtPointer call_data)
{
	exit(0);
}

------------------------------------------------------

Note that TitleFocusColor, TitleFocusColor, TitleUnfocusColor, and
TitleJustify are my hacks (does anyone want the diffs?  I haven't
had time to clean them up, but they're getting the job done at least).
I'm pretty sure that my changes aren't what's causing the problem.
I just tried it with a clean 2.0.42 and new-system.fvwmrc in the
sample.fvwmrc/ directory, and "xtest" had the same problem, so the
problem is most likely not my changes.

In any case, it's only programs that I write that have this problem.
Any other program I compile or run doesn't seem to exhibit this
behavior.

BTW, I'm using XFree86-3.0.2 and Linux v1.3.88.  Any insight into this
matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Danny Sung

Thanks for the tip. If you really want to play it safe you should also
check for negative errno values or cast these errno to unsigned. Unfortunately
I don't have the Sun compiler so I don't have a choice.

By the way what is New Dimension Software?
