Actually, that works pretty well for me.  To reduce interference
between application and window manager key sequences, I have my
root menu bound to Meta-Space and use the hotkeys in it to invoke
various actions.  Most window operations are bound to
Ctrl-Meta-<some key>.

Hello everyone,

I recently installed gabber (yes, because of the MSN problems MS is 
causing) and I want to make some Styles for it. It has a small window 
which indicates status (light bulb when online etc.), a main window, 
chat windows etc. This brings me to this problem. Let's say I have 
windows with these names:

1. gabber
2. Gabber
3. gabber: one-on-one chat

Now window 1. should be titleless and sticky, window 2. should have a 
title and window 3. should have a title and allways appear om location 
x,y of the screen (BTW, how would I do this?)

The problem is that Style seems to be case-insensitive. I tried quoting 
it in `'"three"'` different ways, makes no difference. Does anybody 
have a solution? Thanks!


(off topic) FWIW IMHO the protest page could stay much longer.

I will try that in a lazy moment... :)

It's not exactly what i want but it will do ... menus coming up very
fast and i can put them somewhere on the screen where i don't see
them. It's a kind of hack, but a nice hack... :)

Try setting the position via X resources and/or read FAQ question
3.18.

> The problem is that Style seems to be case-insensitive.

Style are case sensitive.  Your problem comes from the fact that
all gabber windows have the class "Gabber".  At the moment, fvwm
matches either class or resource or window name.  You can tell it
specifically which one to use.

> I tried quoting 
> it in `'"three"'` different ways, makes no difference. Does anybody 
> have a solution? Thanks!

You should be able to "fix" this by choosing a clever order of
your style statements.  Since "Gabber" matches all of these
windows you must specify that style first and override it for the
windows that have a different title:

  Style Gabber title
  Style gabber notitle
  Style "gabber: one-on-one chat" title

(the last line is redundant).

> Fill me in, what's that do?

Well, that's what I wanted to know as well (I never used the do
construct before). So I let it run unattended and it started filling up
memory till a point where my machine started running out of memory and
programs started to crash. Luckily, I could hit C-g quickly enough to
prevent further damage. :)

Now I know that it calculates Fibonacci numbers. I still don't know,
however, why it fills up memory. Emacs doesn't seem to work with
arbitrary precision integers and the do construct is no recursion that
fills up a call stack. So the memory needs are constant. 

Mario, can you explain this?

I'm not Mario, but I can offer a theory.

When I ran it I evaluated it in the scratch buffer.
It didn't seem to be growing very fast.

Since there is a print in there, I think the memory was
space in the output buffer for the printing.

I swithed to using a UTF-8 locale.
It works really nice in FVWM, but gtk (1.2)-based apps displays text as if
it were latin 1.
I set the locale in my .xsession like this:

export LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8 

If I run "echo $LANG" in rxvt started from a menu in FVWM, it says
sv_SE.UTF-8 but if I start an rxvt from this rxvt and run the same command
it says:
sv_SE.ISO-8859-1

This is on RH 7.3

Anyone have an idea of what's going on?
By the way, rxvt still lacks UTF-8 support.

But the printing is going to the *Messages* buffer whose number of
lines is limited.

Well, I wonder whether what I wrote is actually right. I just ran the
expression again and I couldn't see it filling up memory. Here's my
theory of what happened (I don't recall it exactly anymore):

1. I started evaluation of the expression in the *scratch* buffer. This
   takes up a lot of system time which I don't realize since I only
   perform simple tasks like checking email.
2. After an hour or so Sylpheed Claws crashes due to some internal
   error.
3. Trying to start diagnostics applications I suddenly realize that the
   system behaves sluggish. So thinking that the purpose of Mario's
   expression was to fill up memory, I enter EMACS, and hit C-g. Now
   everything seems to be OK because it doesn't use up CPU time anymore.

Maybe I didn't really look carefully at the memory display of xosview
and the memory wasn't really filled up. Maybe the memory was really
filled up (I recently discovered that my kernel has a memory leak) and I
didn't realize that it stayed that way after hitting C-g. I don't know.

Sorry for the confusion.

Felix

It sounds like your shell's profile is overriding the LANG setting (e.g.
/etc/profile)...  I personally set the locale in my zshrc, depending on
whether I'm in an xterm or the console (because Linux's console UTF-8
support is kind of lacking.)

GTK 1.2 apps can be configured to load a Unicode font if you really want
to, but I *do not* recommend this, because the entire font will be
loaded at once.  If you don't use an external font server like xfs, your
entire X server will become unusable for a moment while the font is
loaded.

That said, FVWM 2.5 (using Xft), GTK 2 (again using Xft), and
xterm/mlterm all support UTF-8 beautifully.

The Xresources I use for xterm (which enable UTF-8 amongst other things)
are available at http://themuffin.net/xres/xterm.xresources

Yes, you're right. My .bashrc read some global definition (/etc/profile).
So I fixed that.

I do use XFS. And I also have a script that generates xresources and
.gtkrc and so on.
And the font I set in .gtkrc
"-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
is the same I use in FVWM (there is an iso10646 version of this).
And it works, as mentioned, in FVWM. I don't really mind using a bitmap
font.

Hi together,

I stuck again :-\ The following code is intended to remember
which  window  had  focus  for  page. So when I come back to
certain page the window which had focus on that page at last
should get focus:

DestroyFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
AddToFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc I Next ("CurrentPage" "State 2") Focus
+ I None ("CurrentPage" "Focused") Prev ("CurrentPage" "!Iconified" "!Fvwm*B*") Focus

DestroyFunc MarkWindowAsActiveFunc
AddToFunc MarkWindowAsActiveFunc I Current ("!Iconified") All ("CurrentPage" "!Focused") State 2 False
+ I Current ("!Iconified") State 2 True

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent: new_page CurrentPageFocusFunc 
*FvwmEvent: new_desk CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: focus_change MarkWindowAsActiveFunc

The "State 2" condition seems to be completely ignored. 

Thanks for any hints.

Cheers, Uwe

Moreover, it is a good idea to start the X server with BackingStore
enabled. With XFree86 4.x, BackingStore is disabled by default, to
enable BackingStore you should use the "+bs" option when you start your
X server.

Removing the quotes from the State condition helped on my
box. This might be a minor bug.
The following code produces the desired behaviour:

DestroyFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
AddToFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc I Next (CurrentPage State 2) Focus
+ I None (CurrentPage Focused) Prev (CurrentPage !Iconified !Sticky) Focus

DestroyFunc MarkWindowAsActiveFunc
AddToFunc MarkWindowAsActiveFunc I Current (!Iconified) All (CurrentPage !Focused) State 2 False
+ I Current (!Iconified) State 2 True

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent: new_page CurrentPageFocusFunc 
*FvwmEvent: new_desk CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: focus_change MarkWindowAsActiveFunc

The last focused window gets focus when reentering a
page. Even if the mouse pointer is over another window. 

Cheers, Uwe

You are overusing quotes.  There is no "State 2" condition.  The
"2" is the argument of the "State" condition.  It's not necessary
to quote any of the conditions unless a token contains whitespace
or characters that have to be protected from expansion.  The
"right" way to specify conditions is to separate them with commas
and not use quotes.

>From the man page:

	  ...  The conditions are a list of keywords from

          whitespace. ...

	  Conditions include "AcceptsFocus",
          "!AcceptsFocus", "Focused", "!Focused",
          "HasPointer", "!HasPointer", "Iconic", "!Iconic",
          "Visible", "!Visible", "Raised", "!Raised", 
	  ... ,"State  n"

A example in the manpage would be IMHO quite helpful. 

Thanks anyway.

This is a formatting bug in the man page that has already been
corrected in 2.5.x.  We should have used a different font, not put
the keywords in double quotes.

hello all--having a bit of installation problem.  i am working from the
unstable branch, 2.5.7, i'm a university student on a system that does
not stay as up to date with fvwm as i would like, so i'm forced to
build my own.  i have a working libpng installed at: $HOME/bin/libpng/*
(using $HOME/bin as my prefix is just a habit i started a year or two
ago and i've got so many dependencies there i'd prefer not to break
it).  here is a relevant snip from my shell, it seems to be breaking on
the png support checking..ugh.

I had a look in the ./configure file for you, it seems that
--with-png-library only takes "yes" or "no" as an argument...

No, like any --with-XXX-library, it takes any of these (see acinclude.m4):

dnl     * boolean (no, yes or blank): whether to use library or not
dnl     * file: assumed to be the name of the library
dnl     * directory: assumed to *contain* the library

It seems like there is simply no such directory $HOME/bin/libpng/lib.

The error message is misleading, because of a new autoconf behaviour,
I will fix it. The fixed error message will be:

configure: error: --with-png-library argument must be yes/no, file or directory

Regards,
Mikhael.

hello, i have verified that this is in fact a directory.  i've even gone
so far as to rebuild the libpng libraries and performed its own set of
diagnostics.  everything appears to be behaving AOK.  is there some way
for me to give more information that would be helpful?  please let me
know.  ..i miss my fvwm..

Take a look at the config.log file generated by ./configure.  See
where it tried to detect libpng.  The messages there may help you
solve the problem.  If not, post the file to the mailing list.

The error message indicates it does not come to the png detection, it
fails on the --with-png-library argument parsing, i.e. it is neither
"yes", "no", existing file nor existing directory.

checking for Xpm 3.4g or better... yes
configure: error: argument must be boolean[, file, or directory]

Jesse, if you want fvwm back, recheck this directory and command line,
because I can only reproduce this error when there is no such directory.
Otherwise, if there is such directory configure should not abort, even
if this directory is empty.

There are several other ways to tell the configure about the non standard
library and include directories, like setting LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS before
running configure (run it with --help).

Regards,
Mikhael.

hello, i have successfully gotten past this hurdle; Mikhael,
you were quite correct in that the directory did not exist.
by prepending the = sign to the directory, it does not
interpolate the $HOME variable..  blah blah blah.  i fixed
this by using a fully qualified path.  thanks for the help!

hello--okay so i've managed to configure fvwm properly(?)
with png support.  that is, the message at the end of the
configure process states PNG support as yes.  when i go to
compile, however, i get the attached fatal error.  any
ideas?  i'm including my fvwm-options during configuration,
also.  i've checked the paths, yet again, and the dir
exists and contains the proper png.h file which seems to
be causing the problem for Fpng.h ... hmm.

Yes, this is a bug in fvwm (fixed in the current cvs). As a tmp
fix you can compile as:

gmake CPPFLAGS="-I/home/unmdue/jlf27/bin/libpng/include/libpng12"

Firt of all, I've got 4 desktops with 4x1 pages each.
I wanted to be able to switch between them using well
known keys (Alt+F1..F12 and Alt+Arrows).

Alt+Fx is simple:

Key F1  A M GotoDeskAndPage 0 0 0
Key F2  A M GotoDeskAndPage 0 1 0
Key F3  A M GotoDeskAndPage 0 2 0
Key F4  A M GotoDeskAndPage 0 3 0
Key F5  A M GotoDeskAndPage 1 0 0
Key F6  A M GotoDeskAndPage 1 1 0
Key F7  A M GotoDeskAndPage 1 2 0
Key F8  A M GotoDeskAndPage 1 3 0
Key F9  A M GotoDeskAndPage 2 0 0
Key F10 A M GotoDeskAndPage 2 1 0
Key F11 A M GotoDeskAndPage 2 2 0
Key F12 A M GotoDeskAndPage 2 3 0

F1..F4 block navigates through Desk 0, F5..F8 through Desk 1 and so on...

But then Alt+arrows...  Natural solution seems:

Key Left  A M GotoPage -1p 0p
Key Right A M GotoPage +1p 0p

...but it only allows navigating on one Desk.  So I came up with 
following:


Key Left  A M GotoLeft
Key Right A M GotoRight

DestroyFunc GotoLeft
AddToFunc GotoLeft
+ I PipeRead '\
        maxdesk=2;\
        maxpage=$(($[desk.pagesx]-1));\
        if [ $[desk.n] -gt 0 ]; then\
                prevdesk=$(($[desk.n]-1));\
        else\
                prevdesk=$maxdesk;\
        fi;\
        if [ $[page.nx] -eq 0 ]; then\
                echo GotoDeskAndPage $prevdesk $maxpage 0;\
        else\
                echo GotoPage -1p 0p;\
        fi'

DestroyFunc GotoRight
AddToFunc GotoRight
+ I PipeRead '\
        maxdesk=2;\
        maxpage=$(($[desk.pagesx]-1));\
        if [ $[desk.n] -lt $maxdesk ]; then\
                nextdesk=$(($[desk.n]+1));\
        else\
                nextdesk=0;\
        fi;\
        if [ $[page.nx] -eq $maxpage ]; then\
                echo GotoDeskAndPage $nextdesk 0 0;\
        else\
                echo GotoPage +1p 0p;\
        fi'


Which does the right thing.  I wonder if it can be done easier?  Maybe 
without calling shell?  I used shell because of two things:
 - I wasn't able to check on which page I was.  I know $[page.nx] has
   this information, but I was unable to find something which would
   enable me to write: + I TestSth($[page.nx] == 0) GotoDesk ...
 - And I don't think it is possible to do some calculations from
   within fvwm (like substracting one from current desk number).

My question is more generic -- how should such things be done efficiently?
I feel kind of unhappy knowing that whenever I press Alt+arrow a shell
is being launched just to echo some text.  One little quirk of mine. ;-)
Hmm... perl?  Just tell me what other options are... :-)

   Regards,
      Dawid

Eek, a very convolute if not clever way of doing it :)

There is a utility I use (as a debian package) called "vdesk", which does
what you want.

Hello all,

I am using fvwm 2.5.7 and am trying to make all icons of all
applications look the same save for the pixmap. I have the following
in my .fvwmrc:

Style *           IconSize 32 32
Style *           IconBackgroundColorset grey60
Style *           IconBackgroundRelief 3
Style *           IconBackgroundPadding 0
Style *           IconTitleRelief 3

However, some applications seemt o ignore these styles, most notably,
java applications.

Another problem I have is when I start the thunderbird mail
application, the icon for it doesn't show up until I restart fvwm. The
Icon style for thunderbird is as follows:

Style Inbox*        Icon Mailbox-Summer.dir.xpm

Does anybody have any idea on how to solve these problems? I'd be very
grateful,

thank you,

Ian.

 How can I set different affinity for placements ( top, bottom, left right and so on ) on a per application basis ?

 I have been looking at the doc's but I think I need a hint to start me off.

 As an example of what I mean, I wan't my  browser windows to the top/left, pdf viewer bottom/left, and shells bottom/right, i.e. different apps sorted differently ?

 ( ps. all this applies to the app when iconized )

 / regrads, Lars Segerlund.

One of the more notorious for this is "Netscape". I'd also be inclined to
add:

Style *            IconOverride

To start, for example, pdf viewer at bottom left, run "xpdf -g +0-0".

> ( ps. all this applies to the app when iconized )

This is different, iconic windows are fully managed by a window manager.
This should do what you want:

  Style *      IconBox 400x400+0+0, IconFill l t   # default, browsers etc
  Style Xpdf   IconBox 400x400+0-0, IconFill l b   # pdf viewer
  Style XTerm  IconBox 400x400-0-0, IconFill b r   # terminals
  Style *term* IconBox 400x400-0-0, IconFill b r   # --.--
  Style MyGame IconBox 400x400-0+0, IconFill t r   # something else

There are other Icon* style options that you may add.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, neither this nor

  Style ** IconOverride

does not work as one would expect.

You should specify the style name for _every_ problematic window,
i.e.:

  Style Eterm IconOverride, Icon norm/terminal.xpm
  Style Xpdf  IconOverride, Icon norm/viewer.xpm

I would be happy myself if at least "Style ** IconOverride" would do what
the name suggest, disable any application supplied icon for all apps.

Mikhael.

Yes, perhaps that is one for the future. At least I was on the right lines
as per the right style "IconOverride" :)

Hi everyone

Possibly this is the wrong forum for this question, but I'll risk asking
it here first. Is there any reason why Debian unstable only provides
fvwm 2.4.16, and not fvwm 2.5.7?

Thanks

This doesn't work for me either.

Style JChat*"       IconOverride, Icon nedit.xpm

JChat is an in-house java chat app, and comes up with a really small
icon, suitable for taskbasrs ala KDE and GNOME. (Some of my best
friends like those things, I don't ;). But for *real* icons it's too
small. Problem with this one is, it sets its icon at runtime or
something... I'm gonna have to go take a look-see in that java source
and see if I can fix it.

Just tested another very reluctant java app, and it seems to compy now
:)

Any idea why the IconBackgroundRelief and IconBackgroundPadding are
honoured by some icons and not by others? Does this have to do with a
pixmap being transparent or not?

Thank you all.

Ian.

My guess is a lazy/inactive package maintainer. Mail and ask him:

Meantime, you may try these deb snapshots from a month ago, newer than
2.5.7:

  http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/tmp/snapshots/

I think the next version 2.5.8 will be released as source, rpm (as usual)
and deb packages. Note however that these src, rpm and deb packages are
clean without any distribution specific configs like "old Debian hooks".

Mikhael.

Applications that supply there own icon window (as opposed to a pixmap or
bitmap) override IconSize,IconBackground* and IconTitleRelief styles.

I would like to implement IconSize for those icons too (I guess it could
be done by swallowing the windows, like FvwmButtons does).
So perhaps in 3.0... :-)

   debian unstable is called unstable because it's not stable yet, not 
because it includes unstable (development) versions of apps. Generally 
debian unstable includes latest stable versions of apps (or at least 
that's the goal, as far as I can say).

Do any of you know what's needed to use FVWM 2.4.6 with Gnome 2.2?
(I'm running the "woody" (stable) version of Debian GNU/Linux, with 
the Gnome 2.2 backport to woody.)

The initial problem I'm having is that something in Gnome, apparently
the file manager, is creating a full-screen windows named Desktop;
when I lower some other window, it disappears because it gets lowered
to behind the Desktop window.

Do I want to configure FVWM so the Desktop window is in a lower layer,
or is there a more general solution?  Are there more things I want to
fix?


Thanks,
Daniel

I suggest you use fvwm-2.5.7 or, better, a recent snapshot.

I managed them all to at least comply to the sizes. That's a big win.
However, IconBackgroundRelief and IconBackgroundPadding and stuff I
can't seem to force on all. Some comply, some don't. Seems to me png's
and xpm's that do not have a background of themselves, or are
transparent in certain parts don't take the IconBackgroundColorset and
everything else. Is there any way around this? It would also be nice
if the icon titles wouldn't expand as soon as they get focus. The
titles cover other icons then and makes it hard to click on "the other
one" if your mouse flies over one that is right next to it.

Thank you for the good work sofar.

Ian.

An understanding of the underlying opeations is a good idea here. I'm not
sure how your system is set-up, David, but if you login to your WM via
xdm/gdm/kdm, etc. then adding that line you have there:

exec $(which fvwm-themes-start)

to ~/.xinitrc, **will have no effect**, since all display managers use
"~/.xsession" unless of course "~/.xinitrc" is a symbolic link to
~/.xsession, but I don't recommend this.

The difference between the two files is that "startx" reads "~/.xinitrc"
and all other display managers read ~/.xsession

That, and also the documentation for FVWM is in a constant state of flux

Hello All,

I was trauling through the fvwm man page last night, and found reference
to certain things that will be obsolete / included in fvwm-3.0. 

I am just curious to ask the developers how far away they think the
eminent fvwm3 release will be, what they plan to drastically
change/include into it. Will the configurations differ between 2.x.x and
3.x.x do you suppose?

If you feel like having an option for toggling "sticky bars" across sticky
windows to false/true, that would be a nice idea ;)

Thanks,

-- Thomas Adam

If anything is mentioned as will be "included" in 3.0 it should be read as ..
it won't be implemented in 2.6.0 ;-)

2.6.0 will be the next stable release.. and was/is expected to be out later this
year.

I think it's a bit too early to have answers for those questions... but
better wait for a developer to respond to that one! (I'm just a bystander!)

That's correct. Although that doesn't prevent them from adding the development 
version as well, but under a different name (such as they do with a lot
of packages). And i too am longing for the FVWM development versions in
Debian unstable, because FVWM is about the only package i still have to
install from source.

Ever tried http://www.apt-get.org ??

Try adding:

  deb http://people.debian.org/~sacha/debian stable main
  deb http://people.debian.org/~sacha/debian unstable main
  deb-src http://people.debian.org/~sacha/debian unstable main

to sources.list.  Note that these aren't all that up-to-date; I think
the version there is still 2.5.6.

I was wondering if there is a way to change the style of a menu while it
is open.

The specific application being to have an "active" style and an "inactive"
style such that which ever submenu I am currently looking at will be
"active" and all other open menus "inactive"

Nevertheless interesting ;-) 
I guess the maintainer decided to put it in a separate apt-repository
instead of in the main unstable repository.

Here, with KDE-3.0 and fvwm-2.5.x, adding something like

PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-desktop --desktop kde-sys --desktop kde-sys --dir=/usr/share/applnk --enable-mini-icons --mini-icons-path=/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/'

in the config file build a menu named "Kde-applnk" that you
can bind to your main root menu. Some "local" and "locale" options
(modification) may be needed depending on LANG and your system.

ActiveColorset and GreyedColorset only affect menu items, not the whole
menu. MenuColorset does affect the whole menu, but if I change the
MenuColorset for a menu's style while the menu is open, the menu does not
visibly change. Similarly nothing happens if I change which menu style is
applied to the open menu.

Why?  Does it have improved support for Gnome?

Yes, much improved. Not just GNOME; KDE too.

i just upgraded from fvwm95 (2.0.43d) to the current release of 2.4.15.  
i've successfully updated all my configs, and everything seems to be 
running nicely.

redhat 8.0 uses the package consolehelper/usermode to route specific 
authentication requests through pam.  in 2.0.43 (calling the needed 
program with a simple "exec" statement - like 'exec kppp'), the gnome 
popup would appear, ask for the root password, accept/deny, and run the 
program as appropriate.  i'm now finding that when i use the new format 
('Exec exec kppp'), i get a nifty popup saying "Invalid Call to Subprocess".

i'm sure this is probably a simple config issue, and although i know i 
could modify each entry in the 'menus' config file, i'm hoping there is 
a global method to solve this.

btw, i'm running an out-of-the-box version of redhat 8.0.  i downloaded 
the source for 2.4.15, compiled it with defaults, and installed.  i 
modified/added entries for gdm to call fvwm directly, so i'm not using 
any gnome session-management.  ideally, i'd like to keep them as 
separate as possible.

any ideas?

thanks,
Tony

No, currently this is not possible.  On one hand, fvwm does not
accept any user input except menu navigation while a menu is open.
And on the other hand I shied at the task of possibly resizing and
rearranging the whole menu while it is open.  Note that the size
of the menu might change which requires that the continuation
menus of an open menu may have to be re-created, possible while
one of their sub menus is open.  It did not seem to be worth the
effort.

It's not really a new format.  it just saves you running a shell
process for each application you start this way.  This is achieved
by the "exec" shell command.

Fvwm does not use popup windows, so it must come from your shell
(highly unlikely) or kppp itself.  Can you identify which program
opened the popup window?  If not, using FvwmIdent should help.

Check your kppp installation.  Does it work when invoked on the
command line?  Possibly it expects some environtment variable to
be set.

Hi there again,

The  conditional  command  "All"   seems   to   reject   the
CirculateSkip  style  option. The following code should keep
one xterm window open: 

DestroyFunc showme
AddToFunc showme
+ I Style test CirculateSkip
+ I Exec xterm -T test
+ I Wait test
+ I Exec xterm -T normal
+ I Wait normal
+ I All (CurrentPage) Close

Function showme

On my box all windows on the current page are closed, which
should not happen. At least the xterm "test" should remain
open.

Cheers, Uwe

Would there be any objection to me providing an fvwm-cvs package for
Gentoo linux users?

I already maintain ebuilds (basically bash scripts used to manage
installation [1]) for the stable and development releases, but so much
happens between releases it would be nice for those that are interested 
to be able follow development.

A live-cvs package literally checks out the source from cvs, and
installs it distinctly from the non-cvs package, so both can be
installed simultaneously.

some projects have objected in the past, on the basis that they dont
want to provide support to people who are using cvs builds, and some
projects have welcomed it (eg kde, a few developers were so impressed
with the feature they even switched to gentoo).

[1] For example, http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/fvwm-2.5.7-r2.ebuild

As documented in the man page.  Use

  All (!CirculateHit, CurrentPage) Close

instead.

Well, this works. But I don't get behind the logic of
this. Applying a style "CirculateSkip" to a window means to
me that this window is to be skipped when I cycle through
windows using Prev, Next and All. 

Further, conditional commands work on "all windows meeting
the conditions."
So if a window is set to be "CirculateSkip" how can the
condition "!CirculateHit" execlude this window.

I thought the idea about the CirculateSkip style is that
this window is execluded by the conditional commands by
default. From the man page:
	 
                       The All command implies the condi-
  tions  CirculateHit,  CirculateHitIcon   and   Circula-
  teHitShaded.   They  can  be  turned  off by specifying
  "!CirculateHit" etc. explicitly.

The styles Circulate* are not described in the man page at
all. Isn't the style CirculateHit the default for windows
which do not have the CirculateSkip style?

Cheers, Uwe

Only Prev and Next by default consider the CirculateSkip style option.
Others by default do not do this. If you are not sure what are the
defaults, you may always specify the corresponding condition,
CirculateHit or !CirculateHit, but often it just works as expected.

Condition CirculateHit (the default for All) means do not consider the
CirculateSkip style option. Respectively, "!CirculateHit" means consider.

The name of the condition CirculateHit is highly unfortunate. It should
be something like IgnoreCirculateSkipStyleOption.

I hope the above explanation helps to distinguish between CirculateHit
condition (bad name) and CirculateHit style option.

That explains it. Twice the same name for quite different
things caused my confusing.

Logically CirculateHit (or !CirculateSkip) condition would
match all windows which do not have the CirculateSkip style.
So !CirculateHit (or CirculateSkip) condition would match
all windows which do have the CirculateSkip style applied. A
third condition say IgnoreCirculateSkipStyleOption would
match both styles.

It does. I hope this confusion will be fixed in some of the
next versions or well explained in the man page ;-)

Thanks for the explanation.

Cheers, Uwe

whoa!  thanks for getting back to me so quickly!!  you rock!

anyway, i didn't provide a whole lot of info because i figured this might be a 
fairly common issue, as my installation is all very generic and off-the-shelf.

anyway, the popup is a gnome dialog box.  when i run the program kppp (or any of 
the included redhat config apps) from the command line (so far i've tried it in 
xterm and rxvt), it runs fine.  what happens is that the "executable" is 
actually just linked to a program called 'consolehelper' that checks 
authentication rules through pam, then calls the appropriate program in a 
'semi-sudo' type of context.  arguments are passed transparently, but i don't 
actually RUN the program -- its kinda like a local proxy server of sorts.

so the "new format" just saves me from running a shell process with each 
program.  and that actually makes sense -- now with the 'exec exec kppp', i'm 
not running a shell process, which is why it worked before (when i WAS running a 
shell process with the 'exec kppp').  is there a way to force a shell process on 
a menu item? i'm sure that would solve this...

Just omit one of the "exec"s.  I know it's a bit confusing:  the
first "exec" (or "Exec") is the fvwm command.  Everything behind
it is passed to the shell:

  Exec exec kppp
  ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^
   |       |________ command passed to the shell
   |________________ Fvwm command

So your former "exec kppp" should work too:

  exec kppp
  ^^^^ ^^^^
   |    |___________ command passed to the shell
   |________________ Fvwm command

i tried modifying my config to use "exec kppp", and i get the same gnome 
error as when the line reads "Exec exec kppp".  when i try "kppp" in 
fvwmconsole, i get "[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 
'kppp'" (as expected).  using "exec kppp" in fvwmconsole, i get the 
gnome error (above).  if, however, i use "xterm -e kppp", i get a shell 
and the authentication step proceeds properly.  its almost as if the 
exec statement is not using a shell process at all, but instead calling 
the link directly.

like i said, it worked just fine in 2.0.43.   any ideas?

Try using 2.4.16.  There were some changes made to the way Exec works
after 2.4.15.

kppp launches fine for me using the latest CVS.  2.4.16 uses the same
logic as the latest CVS.

If you really can't use 2.4.16 for some reason, try:

Exec bash -c kppp

What exactly did you try that does not work, did you actually try what I
said? There were several similar questions in the past. It works.

  Exec fvwm-root -r somebg.png
  Colorset 5 RootTransparent
  #MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5  # redundant for fvwm-themes

Or better yet:

  Colorset 5 RootTransparent buffer, bg average, Tint black 30, bgTint black 30

I don't think you may currently have RootTransparent and TiledPixmap,
Olivier may correct me. But RootTransparent and Tint looks well.

P.S. Your subject line does not help to archive users to understand the
problem. How about Subject: transparency in menus with tiled png image

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

How do I tell FVWM to allow a window to be resized greater than the
dimensions of the screen? I have an app that requires quite a significant
amount of screen real-estate & it's being chopped off on my laptop
which has smaller dimensions.

I tried:

Style * ResizeHintOverride
Style * MaxWindowSize

but with no luck.

I'm using 2.5.7.

Any help/pointers appreciated.

SCoTT. :)

Ah, I just noticed that if I restart my app it isn't restricted
any longer & I can resize it any way I like.

I guess dynamically setting (FvwmTalk) the above options means the settings
get applied to _new_ windows, not existing ones?

I think at least some modern shells are clever enough to imply
"exec" if they run a program non-interactively (i.e. they
terminate themselves on their own).  If all else fails, writing a
shell script should help.  However, I think this is a bug in the
gnome wrapper you mentioned.  It shouldn't be this picky about how
it is started.

I.e. programs invoked with "exec" now run with stdin/stdout
detached.

Hi,

If a client sets WM_NORMAL_HINTS on a window and then starts a resize wit=
h
EWMH "moveresize" before any ConfigureRequest is generated, fvwm will use
old data.  The last part of the patch will probably trigger in other case=
s
too.

Hello Mikhael, 

I have never used GNOME or KDE, because I need my resources otherwise...

So my Question:

What are the improvements for GNOME and KDE ?

I do not need stuff like this. 
Are there compile-options to leave it out ?

Thanks
Michelle

I just used "strace" to monitor FvwmPager for an hour and
it never used the disk.

Do you have any evidence that FvwmPager or FvwmButtons is
using your disk?

If you want to remove the buttons and get a clean title bar
you may try:

TitleStyle  Inactive  TiledPixmap title-inactive.xpm -- Flat
ButtonStyle All Inactive Simple -- Flat UseTitleStyle

Hi there,

Since I got an  application  which  opens  small  windows  a
couple   of  times  I  switched  to  CascadePlacement  since
TileCascadePlacement caused fvwm to  place  the  windows  at
different positions on the screen which is quite annoying. 

However, I like the CascadePlacement style, except  that  if
there  is  no  uniconified  window  on  the  current page it
sometimes places the window  as  if  there  would  be  other
windows.  I  would like if the new window is the only one on
the page fvwm would place it at the  top  left  corner.  The
next  window  should  be  placed  in  cascading style. Icons
should be fully ignored. So new  windows  should  be  always
placed  at  the top left corner if there is not other window
on the page e.g. in the working area. 

Can this be achieved?

BTW:  I  got  a  couple   of   applications   swallowed   by
FvwmButtons. Maybe the confuse the placement. 

Thanks in advance.

Cheers, Uwe

I'm still not sure what the problem is.  Can you cut out the relevant
portion of the picture and post it to the mailing list.  And please
try to reword your description.

With FvwmEvent, if you don't mind the flashing.

Yes, they do.  You can make the swallowed apps appear somewhere
off screen before swallowing them.  For example, I have this in
my config:

  *FvwmButtons(Swallow FvwmPager 'FvwmPager * * \
    -geometry 40x40-2000-2000')
                   ^^^^^^^^^^

For the moment I want to see how it goes without
FvwmEvent. I don't like to overuse FvwmEvent.

Tricky. Using this helps a bit. But the behaviour is still
strange to me. 
Repeated use of PlaceAgain on a window moves it towards the
bottom right corner - even if it is the only window on the
page. 

Is there a way to reset the cascade algorithm? I think a
function which is executed when I entering a page like:

AddToFunc ResetCascadePlacementWhenEmpty
+ I None (CurrentPage, !CirculateHit) ResetCascadePlacement

would help a lot. Maybe a ReadjustCascadePlacement function
which takes existing windows into account is even better.

Cheers, Uwe

Hi!

I have a specific idea, but I don't know how to do in in fvwm.
I'd like to have a taskbar at the bottom, but in that area, I also want
to have a process monitor and a pager.
So basically I want this.

+-------++----------------------------------------+-----+--------+-----+
| Start || xmms | gimp | xawtv |                  |pager|cpu:50% |15:02|
+-------++----------------------------------------+-----+--------+-----+

AFAIK FvwmTaskbar cannot swallow anything, and I don't know how to tell to
it not to fill to the right. So I'd like to avoid Taskbar's windowlist
and pager/process monitor overlapping.

Any ides?

thx
Gergo

The usual way to emulate this is to use FvwmButtons as the base
container, define a button for the menu and swallow FvwmIconMan
for the application button.  Any number of additional buttons and
swallowed apps can be defined easily.

I'm not sure whether a config for this fairly complex setup is
floating around here.

Assuming that this window is the initial window when the program loads,
you can use FvwmEvent to achieve this:

----------------------------------------------
*FvwmEvent-MyWin: StartDelay 4
*FvwmEvent-MyWin: add_window FuncWarptoLocale

AddToFunc FuncWarptoLocale
  + I Next ("The_Window") Move 0 0

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent-MyWin
---------------------------------------------------

(where "The_Window" is the window you want to move -- I have not tested
the above, mind.)

> The

If the window is a transient window then you can do the same thing above,
i.e.

------------------------------
AddToFunc FuncWarptoLocale
  + I Next ("The_Window") Move 0 0
  + I Style $0 CascadePlacement
-----------------------------------

Perhaps, if you try and edit my example.

Thanks the idea and the quick response.


The menu is not so important, so I'll try to figure it out.
If FvwmTaskBar can be so easily implemented by other modules (not taking
into consideration the built-in clock in FvwmTaskBar), than why is there
FvwmTaskbar?

If none has such a config, I will play a little with an auto-hiding
pager. (this needs fvwm2.5, isn't it? I cannot grab the action "mouse
pointer entered" action, right?

Hi.

Can I use image with size 18x16 as button images in Title without scalling it or
resizing? So I need something like this:

I have set of images with size :

% identify closeAD.xpm 
closeAD.xpm XPM 18x16+0+0 DirectClass 16-bit 646.0 0.031u 0:01
% identify minimizeAD.xpm 
minimizeAD.xpm XPM 18x16+0+0 DirectClass 16-bit 634.0 0.039u 0:01
% 

And I want to use it in title as a buttons with height 16:
~ % grep 'TitleStyle.*Height' .fvwm2rc 
TitleStyle Height 16
~ % 

If I use :
TitleStyle Height 16
ButtonStyle Number State Pixmap "somepixmap_18x16.xpm"

fvwm allocate for button 16x16 rectangle, but i need 18x16

What can I do?

ps: sorry for my english, it's not my native language.

.:ChiP:.

It was backported from fvwm95.  I think at that time FvwmTaskbar
could not be emulated well.  But it is definitely a candidate for
future removal.

Right.  This works only in 2.5.

I am not sure to understand what you want exactly But a
titlebar button is always a square in fvwm. But what about

TitleStyle Height 18

you will see a 18x16 button, No?

Hi!

--- From the NEWS file in fvwm2.5.7 ---

* FvwmTheme is obsolete now, but still supported for some time.

--- And I know from the FAQ, that: ---

6.2  I'd really like {OpenWindows, NeXT, Win95, Mac, etc} look and
     feel.  Are you going to support that?

A: This is not our primary mission, but we think fvwm does a pretty
   good job of producing these appearances.

   You may want to take a look at the
        http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/
   package.

If I'm not mistaken, this has nothing to to with FvwmTheme.

Will fvwm themes be included in fvwm.

So, if I want themes, there is nothing "official", but I can happyly
install fvwm-themes?

Gergo

You're correct, it does not. The module "FvwmTheme" is there to provide
one with a way of using coloursets and the like (man FvwmTheme).

> Will fvwm themes be included in fvwm.

You are confusing the issue here.... fvwm-themes is a separate "project"
from fvwm, in that all fvwm-themes is, is a set of highly
intelligent/configurable scripts to be used with the window manager: FVWM.

> So, if I want themes, there is nothing "official", but I can happyly
> install fvwm-themes?

That is correct :) All the hard-work has been done for you, with
fvwm-themes.

Hope That Helps,

You can obtain the "test" release of fvwm-themes-0.7.0 (available from:

http://fvwm-themes.sf.net
)

But you'll need to use the CVS version 2.5.8 (also available from that
site). Essentially though "man fvwm" will provide you with the new
features, even if they have not been applied in your configuration file
yet.

What???

But it's such a good module.
W/o having to build one from other pieces, i get active tasks, mail,
mail indicator, calendar, command hooks. Plus my version compacts it into
a small space....controllable width, clock under Start when double row.

That and pager are all i have visible.

Not to worry,
it will be removed when and if FvwmButtons or some other module can
completely replace it.

Is there anything that will inhibit keyboard shortcuts from working? I
have the following in the .fvwmrc file (attached). However, these
shortcuts don't work when I have fvwm2 running.  I have a Mandrake Linux
8.0 distribution. 

Thanks

Yes, If your num-lock or scroll-lock key is pressed.  See FAQ

Hi folks,
I am not to deep into GUI's and stuff but since X is a god driver for 4 Xterms I use it.

I succesfully customized fvwm that way, that all my windows present a pixmap as border title-bar etc
even my Pager, Button-bar, and roo-menu does this.

now my Question 
is it possible that all my other application such as sylpheed, gimp, etc (not openoffice)
which seem to use their layout from fvwm do not use that ugly grey for all their dialogs
menubars etc.
it would be cool if i could place a pixmap would be cool there.

I thought fwvm-themes could do that but I do not know where to use the colorset I have created.
for the  normal FvwmForms I got it done (colorset is ok then ) bu the rest for all other applikation ????

hope I could make my self clear.

THX in advance

Eg opera provides an option to do that for him (does not use fvwm native elements i suppose)

If these applications are GTK based then you will need to edit "~/.gtkrc".
You should really google for examples of how/what to change.

Apologies for the vagueness of this answer.

Or you can use the theme settings from gnomecc which points
you to already installed gtkrc's on your system:

/usr/share/themes/BrushedMetalClean/gtk/gtkrc:

Evning!

Just one quick question. Is it possible to move windows between pages
even though I use this:

    EdgeResistance 10000 10000
    EdgeScroll 0 0
    EdgeThickness 0

With keybindings for example?

Hi there 
THX for the answers which gave me a lead where to search

my system is just an base Xfree + fvmw 
no gnome, kde, cde, or other overfeatured "framework".
gtk should be installed.

I've got a fresh RedHat 9 installation on a workstation. Under
the stock Gnome/Metacity desktop, the thing works fine (to the
extent that Metacity ever works :-)

Now when I build fvwm 2.5.7 and change my .xsession file to launch
it, I have terrible problems: X basically just stops responding as
soon as I move a window, or do almost anything else to a window.
The X server has to be sent a "kill -9" to get rid of it.  The same
thing happens if I start Mozilla, immediately after the window
decorations are drawn (none of Mozilla per se is ever rendered).

I've successfully use fvwm elsewhere (it's running on the laptop
I'm typing this from now), and this is the first time I've had 
any sort of problem at all.

Anybody else seen this?

Funny you should mention Redhat 9.0.

I just installed it at work on a server and was able to run whatever
WM is the default.

When I started Fvwm, any key I hit resulted in the display resizing
as if I had hit Ctl-Alt +/-.

Ctl-Alt backspace still worked though.

I was too busy to make any attempt to debug it.

Well, after randomly rebuilding a few things, it seems to be happy now.
I really am not sure what I did to fix it.

Well, this is strange.  I'm using RH9.0 right now with fvwm 2.4.15 and
there's really no problems I've seen.  Have you tried an earlier version
of fvwm?

No.  I didn't have time to fool around with it.
I was using a CVS build from April, built on Mandrake
8.2.

The way it was acting seemed more like an X server problem
than something caused by Fvwm.  But it did work with whatever
RH supplies.  Thinking about it, I'm not really sure what I
would do to debug it.  Not that I have to, its a server.
I normally work on it remotely.

Hello.

I am looking for a way of doing arithmetic in the configuration
file of Fvwm, in order to position windows in the task bar I am
trying to setup.

Searching old messages, I have found an indication that the
FvwmPerl module could do what I want. It had been suggested to do
put the following in the configuration file:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmPerl

DestroyFunc .
AddToFunc .
+ I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The . function would preprocess its argument prior
to delivering it to Fvwm.

When I try the following

. Echo %{ $[vp.width] - 100 }%

in FvwmConsolde, it does work and I get=20

[FVWM][Echo]: 1300

as the output.

But if I put that command in my configuration file, it
does not work when I restart Fvwm.

Any clues?

I forget to tell I am running Fvwm 2.5.7 on Gentoo Linux.

Make sure FvwmPerl is running when you use "." function.
Use ModuleSynchronous, not Module command as suggested in the man page.

Any explanation for this behaviour (works in FvwmConsole only)?

> Make sure FvwmPerl is running when you use "." function.

FvwmPerl is running:

$ ps x | grep FvwmPerl
25356 vc/1     S      0:00 /usr/bin/perl -w /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.7/FvwmPerl 7 4 none 0 8

> Use ModuleSynchronous, not Module command as suggested in the man page.

Using ModuleSynchronous now:

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl

When you run it in FvwmConsole, FvwmPerl is already running,
when you use "." function in .fvwm2rc, it is not yet.

It's running when you issue "ps", but not when you SendToModule.
Bad timing or command order.

You may use SendToModule in StartFunction or InitFunction. If you want to
use in in the top level, i.e. before StartFunction is even callled, then
you should have "ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl" as the first command in
your .fvwm2rc.

Nothing FvwmPerl specific, any module with SendToModule would behave
similarly.

Mikhael.

Hello

I am starting a pager with the following commands in my
configuration file:

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPager 0 3

Style FvwmPager	NoTitle
Style FvwmPager	BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0
Style FvwmPager	Sticky, StaysOnTop
Style FvwmPager	WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip

*FvwmPager: Geometry x$[MyTaskBarHeight]+0-0

Now I want to determine its width when calculating the
position and size of an IconMan window, which I want
to put side by side (to the right) of the pager.

How can I accomplish this?

Regards,

Romildo

Use FvwmButtons to swallow both, the FvwmIconMan and the
FvwmPager.  This way, they both get the same height without any
manual intervention.

Not out of the box.  I solve this problem with a high delay before
paging occurs:

  EdgeResistance   500 128
                   ^^^

Whe I hit the edge, I can usually prevent paging.  The pointer has
to hover over the edge for half a second.

Alternatively you can make a function that disables edge
resistance for a move operation:

  addtofunc move_noresist
  + I EdgeResistance 10000 100
  + I Move
  + I EdgeResistance 10000 10000

  mouse 1 t m function move_noresist

Good Morning,

I am having an issue that my screen goes blank every 5 minutes. I would 
like to disable all screen savers. Is there a way of accomplishing this?

Thanks

Brian

I don't think this is a screen-saver issue, but try:

xset -s blank 0 

to diable that.

  xset s off

Try

  Key F10     A   N   Next ("*vim*", currentpage)  DeiconifyFocusAndWarp
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrading to the latest stable version might be a good idea too
(fvwm-2.4.16).

Hi,
   I am an fvwm newbie, so please forgive my ignorance, but...

   How do I prevent the window list that you get by clicking on the
destktop from appearing at all?

   RTFM is a fine answer if you can point me to the place in the
manual. I have been looking...

Thanks,
David

 I am an fvwm newbie, so please forgive my ignorance, but...

How do I prevent the window list, or any other context menu, from
appearing when you click on the desktop?

I have the following lines in my system.fvwm2rc file:
Mouse 1                R       A       WindowList
Mouse 2                R       A       WindowList
Mouse 3                R       A       WindowList

When I either comment them out, or try to remap them as follows
Mouse 1 R A -
Mouse 2 R A -
Mouse 3 R A -

then I end up getting a Builtin Menu (with items, Xterm, Setup Form, etc.)
in its place.

I want to eliminate any context menu altogether.

Thanks in advance,
David

Bind the mouse events to a function that doesn't do anything?

You want to click on the root and get nothing at all?

You should be able to remove this built-in binding:

Mouse 1 R A Menu MenuFvwmRoot

With:

Mouse 1 R A -

If that doesn't work, look for another binding in your .fvwm2rc or tell
us which release you are using.

Also look for bindings to "Mouse 0" (which means any button).

The man page lists all built-in bindings.  You can remove them by
replacing their action with a '-':

  Key Help R A -
  Key F1 R A -
  Key Tab A M -
  Key Escape A MC -
  Mouse 1 R A -
  Mouse 1 T   A -
  Mouse 1 FS  A -
  Mouse 2 FST A -

As Dan noted, you want to remove the "Mouse 1 R A ..." binding.

Is there a way to make this solution adjust automatically? (e.g. 100% in 
width)?

I did play around with FVWMButtons once and I think it is much to 
complicated to make it a replacement for FvwmTaskbar (IMHO). There 
should be a more simple way of placing and sizing the content of it. 
(Ok, maybe there is, but I did not find out.)

How I would like to configure it (Pseudocode):

Set Rows: 1
Add a Menu at the left
Swallow FvwmPager (which automatically should take so much space as it 
requires)
Swallow FvwmIconMan (which takes all the space that is not used by other 
Butttons)
Swallow xload, a net-load-tool and a clock at the right.

Ok, I think most users will install a ready to use panel like the 
gnome-panel that can be configured by dragNdrop. Does work the cvs 
version of Fvwm with gnome2 nowadays? I think there have been some 
problems with it recently, isn't it?

I have read that someone did let the gnome-panel swallow FvwmPager. Is 
this really possible? That would be great. Or can the gnome-Pager 
control the Fvwm-Pages of one (or maybe multiple) desktops?

Thank you,

Gert

You could use something like:

$[w.x] $[w.y] $[w.width] $[w.height] 

to set the geomtry, by using a Complex Function and "PipeRead" so that the
underlying shell (probably Bash) can perform some arithemtic, if need be.

It's not so much complicated as it is that the documentation is extremely
heavy going. The developers should not take that as an insult, but rather
as a constructive critiscism, since it would help greatly with our
understanding if some examples could be provided.

Also, I never really understood why "man fvwm" was never split up into
smaller man pages.

Using Fvwm-2.5.7 causes no problems, since that has native EWMH support
already built in...no, Gnome2 works fine with fvwm, as long as you
configure it to suit your needs.

Hmm, I think that *might* be possible, I am not sure.

It does succeed in getting rid of the window list, but it's replaced with
a menu "Builtin Menu".

There don't appear to be any other mouse bindings.
My fvwm version:
FVWM version 2.4.6 compiled on Apr  8 2002 at 20:52:23
with support for: ReadLine, Stroke, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM,
Multibyte, Xinerama

This seems to be the latest stable Debian linux release.

My system.fvwm2rc file is below.
It has been setup to produce a kiosk/task-station which can run a limited
set of programs.
Thanks!
David

# Features of this system.fvwm2rc file for the kiosk
# Application window does not lose focus when mouse is moved

#	see checkstation_start.sh script
# Another button runs xlock (part of xlockmore package)
# Third button runs a script which runs halt (halt is run SUID root -- kludgy)
# Runs xlock

# Centering Buttons: the Launch and Shutdown buttons are by default

Hi!

If there's animated move, that do fvwm users have animated resize?

Anyway. How to resize a window relatively to current size?
Eg how to grow the window by 10 percent of window/screen?

Thx

To think it over again, it is not a wise idea.
First try AnimatedMove. In the same fashion AnimatedResize...

Do you have spaces after backslash?

Focus command does not accept such argument, it may be ThisWindow Focus.
Anyway, ThisWindow is redundant in this example, just Focus would do.
Using SloppyFocus may help too.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello,

I have been browsing through the man-page of fvwm for ages.
I searched in the Mailing-list but it did not help me out either.

So the problem is the following:

On my Mandrake 9.1 I have 3 XServers (all of them running fvwm 2.5.7 
WITHOUT Xinerama) at the same time.
But since the monitors attached to the XServers are not all running with 
the same resolutions, it would be fine, not all have the same resolution. 
I use more or less one page for each application. Therefore I want them to 
be maximized right from the start.
Is this possible via Styles? (Ok it would be possible to write a function 
for each application, and then by calling this function the application 
would get started and AFTERWARDS maximized by the function. But I do not 
like this, because of the mess of Functions to create on the one hand, and 
due to the fact, that sometimes I start them from a terminal (and there 
this fvwm-function is not directly accessible.)

So what I was looking for was something like:

Style XTerm StartMaximized

but I could not find anything.
-------------------------------------
This leads to the second question ... geometry. It is possible to set the 
geometry of application via several ways, but I cannot get the most usable 
(for my case) working at all.
Since I use FvwmButtons on my second display, I do not want the 
applications Maximized there. I want them a bit less than maximized. Just 
as big, such that I can see/use all buttons. But on the first display the 
application should be as large as the resolution is. Same for the third 
display.
Since fvwm allows different files for different displays, it would be fine 
to have the geometry in the Styles section of my config-files.
But I just cannot get this sorted out. I tried tons of things, but all 
sorts of different syntax for

Style XTerm Geometry: 10x10+0+0

did not work. How to write this correctly? (Meanwhile I have written a 
script for the applications I use more often, which checks the value of 
$DISPLAY an then sets the parameters correctly. But I'd prefer to have 
this in the fvwm configuration.)
-------------------------------------
And finally the third question, which is probably not directly related to 
this: Moving applications. First of all, let me remind you, that I do NOT 
use Xinerama. On the one hand it slows down my system dramatically. (I was 
mean while told, that this is due to my second graphic card, which is 
probably too old and cheap in order to be useable with Xinerama.) On the 
other I recon it to be a more productive environment, when not having to 
fiddle around with Stickyness of Windows in order not to loose them when 
switching Pages on other displays.
But now for the question.
What I want to is to move an application from :0.0 COMPLETELY to :0.1
So I have running maple running on :0.0 . Then when pleased with the 
results I want them to write down in emacs. emacs also runs on :0.0 . So 
either make both applications fit on one page (or make the sticky, 
stayontop, whatever), or save the file in Maple. Start maple on :0.1 and 
load the saved file, in order to see both applications at the same time.

I was told, that xmove (a pseudo XServer) should deal with such problems, 
but after compiling and setting up, it never showed any windows (not only 
in fvwm, but also in IceWM. And I got reports, that IceWM is capable of 
doing xmove-things. So it not a problem of fvwm -- its a problem of me 
getting xmove to run at all.)

But as fvwm has SO many things included by itself, and since I want to 
move the application from an fvwm-managed XServer to another fvwm-managed 
XServer (notably both on the same machine) I thought, that there maybe 
something hidden somewhere in fvwm, that might assist me.
Probably not, but if I would not have asked, I'd propably hate myself for 
not asking, if there was something :-D


Of course I know that it is not good, to have three questions in one email 
to a list, but 2 of them are really closely connected -- and well the 
third just dropped in be, lets say by ... mistake.


Best regards and keep up the good work,
Christian Aistleitner

Yes! That worked! Thanks, Dan.
A followup newbie question:
What do R, N, A, etc. signify? I'm looking through the man page but am not
finding their definitions.

Thanks again,
David

Look under key/mouse bindings.

R = Root.
A = Any modifier.
N = No modifier.

(On this list, replies are normally placed in context,
unnecessary text is removed.)

Xterm understands X resources.

I use rxvt instead of xterm, but a similar approach would work
for xterm.
Here is what I use to force rxvt to almost full screen height
(font matters too):

#if ( HEIGHT == 900 )
Rxvt.geometry: 80x55
#elif ( HEIGHT == 1024 )
Rxvt.geometry: 80x65
#elif ( HEIGHT == 768 )
Rxvt.geometry: 80x47
#else                     /* I have no idea... */
Rxvt.geometry: 80x40
#endif

"HEIGHT" is defined by xrdb which loads the xresources.


Fvwm sets variables for the screen dimensions which can
be used in Piperead for this kind of thing.

I'd be more inclined to add it in "~/.Xresources" (often symlinked to
~/.Xdefaults).

When you put things in ~/.Xdefaults doesn't xrdb still do the loading?


I used to use .Xdefaults, but I found that it got out of control
because it was too big.

Now I have this in my .xinitrc:

  cat $HOME/xdef/*.ad | xrdb -load

And I have a bunch of X.ad files in ~/xdef.

Yeah, i mean there's nothing wrong with you doing that, although I
question your command above. "cat" will display the contents, surely
something like:

``
for i in $(ls -1 $HOME/xdef/*.ad); do xrdb -merge $i; done
''

would be better? Or am I missing something?

"ls" isn't necessary.

for i in $HOME/xdef/*.ad; do xrdb -merge $i; done

would eliminate the multiple invocations of ls.

But that leaves the multiple invocations of xrdb.

There's no need to do the files one at a time
cat'ing them all together and putting them on xrdb's stdin
seems better to me.

Hi!

I'm exploring the new features of fvwm 2.5.8
I'm browsing the fvwm-themes to get new ideas.
I know transparent FvwmPager, FvwmButtons is possible.
But I cannot figure it out how to configure them.
Can sy give me a *MINIMAL* config, which results in transparent Pager
in a transparent backgrounded FvwmButtons?

My try is something like:
DestroyModuleConfig Fvwm*
Colorset 1 transparent
Style Fvwm* Colorset 1

*FvwmButtons: (Swallow "FvwmPager""FvwmPager 0 0")

I also want to swallow a transparent xclock, but I think it will be
solved, if I can solve the above config...

Thx in advance
Gergo

ps: any tutorials for fvwm ?

Thats true. A already got such things working before. I just did not 
mention it, since I really want to use FVWMs capabilites for doing such 
things.

X resources are not the way I want to go, because I do not think that it 
is good, to have configs for applications spread throughout the system. 
(That is having defined Stickyness in .fvwm2rc (or some include), while 
the geometry is set via a completely different (from the user point of 
view)mechanism -- namely X resources.) On the other hand I only used XTerm 
to name some application. Indeed I want to do this for more than one 
application. And not all of them support X resources. (And begging the 
authors of the software for X resource support is NOT the way to go)

Besides:

> #if ( HEIGHT == 900 )
> Rxvt.geometry: 80x55
> #elif ( HEIGHT == 1024 )
> Rxvt.geometry: 80x65
> #elif ( HEIGHT == 768 )

> #else                     /* I have no idea... */
> Rxvt.geometry: 80x40
> #endif

would not help either, because :0.1 is of Height 600 ... but you have to 
subtract the FvwmButtons Height. :0.2 is also of Height 600, but without 
the FvwmButtons. Ok it can be managed to get this working with X resources.
But actually, as I already said in my initial mail, and again in this one: 
I am really looking for an FVWM-way, to express the geometry.
Especially since lots of applications do not care about X resources. (Or I 
am not able to get them working the way I want them too.)

Then see my other comment about PipeRead and Fvwm variables that give
screen dimensions.

I don't have any examples but question 7.14 in the FAQ will provide
some clues.

Look, as I said, I already have the thing up and running. Via skripts and 
functions, that pass the apropriate values. This works. But I think that 
these are cumbersome and was therefore looking for some simple Style 
command, that would allow me to enter fixed values for the geometry in one 
line. Since I split up the config files for each display, to get the 
desired values for the geometry is not the problem.

The only point is "How to get the geometry in a single Style command?" 
(Not in functions, X resources, scripts or whatever. Since I already know 
how these things work, as I tried them out (and use them))

This does not exist AFAIK. And indeed I just wanted to know, if it really 
does not exist, or I just cannot find it. But since no one just came here 
and said "This is the way to do such things with Styles" ...
So I guess it just is not implemented in fvwm. Thats ok.

Thanks for your time and effort.

Best regards,
Christian Aistleitner

The FAQ answer 3.18 suggests several solutions. You don't like to create
functions for all applications, so don't use this approach. But you may
use FvwmEvent that maximizes all xterms and maybe some other apps when
they are launched. This way you may start apps from the command line too.

It seems you want to use "Maximize 100 grow" or "Maximize 0 -80p" to
solve your FvwmButtons problem.

Are you sure you want to start any xterm maximized (I would dislike this),
maybe just setup a binding like Alt-F10 to maximize/unmaximize any
focussed window?

Mikhael.

Hmmm, I'm trying to use the functionapproach. What I'm trying to produce
is a keybinding F1 with CM as modifiers to move the window in focus to
Page 0 3. Could someone figure out a solution to this?

Do you mean MoveToPage and MoveToDesk commands? See the man page.

Here are bindings from fvwm-themes:

# move to page, Shift+Ctrl+KP_N  
Key KP_1        A       SC      MoveToPage 0 2
Key KP_2        A       SC      MoveToPage 1 2
Key KP_3        A       SC      MoveToPage 2 2
Key KP_4        A       SC      MoveToPage 0 1
Key KP_5        A       SC      MoveToPage 1 1
Key KP_6        A       SC      MoveToPage 2 1
Key KP_7        A       SC      MoveToPage 0 0
Key KP_8        A       SC      MoveToPage 1 0
Key KP_9        A       SC      MoveToPage 2 0
Key KP_0        A       SC      MoveToPage prev

# move to desk, Shift+Ctrl+N
Key 1           A       SC      MoveToDesk 0 0
Key 2           A       SC      MoveToDesk 0 1
Key 3           A       SC      MoveToDesk 0 2
Key 4           A       SC      MoveToDesk 0 3
Key 0           A       SC      MoveToDesk prev

There are corresponding GotoPage and GotoDesk bindings too, with Ctrl-Alt.

I think you missunderstood. I want to move windows (with the above
settings) between pages (yes pages, I only use one desk), not just

Just a note, you usually can't bind anything to Ctrl-Alt-FN, it is
trapped by X Server (or kernel, it is really not important by what).

xfe may ask for a specific position on behalf of the user.  In
fvwm-2.5.7, you can disable this too:

  Style xfe !UseUSPosition, !UsePPosition
  Style xfe !UseTransientUSPosition, !UseTransientPPosition

I think mozilla sets the title of the mail window only after it
has bee mapped.  Initially, it comes up with

  Name: "Mail & Newsgroups"
  Resource: "Mozilla"
  Class: "mail:3pane"

Try

  Style Mail* ...

or something similar.

Hi All,

I'm trying to configure the development brach of fvwm-2.5.6 
under the gnome2/nautilus environment provided by Debian/unstable 
(the fvwm package by debian maintainer A. Kotelnikov).

All work nicely but I have problem with associating of some
actions. I'm accustomed to use of the root window menu on X window
root and mouse strokes by this way:

Mouse 1         R       A       Menu "LongRootMenu" Nop
Mouse 3         R       2
Stroke N654 3 R 2 Desk -1 0
Stroke N456 3 R 2 Desk +1 0

The presented functions works nicely in plain Xwindow envirnoment
as well as in gnome2 without nautilus running. The configuration
doesn't work when nautilus manages of Xroot window (It show some 
beautiful rectangles and nautilus menu, but it isn't what I want). 

There is a way to not propagate events from fvwm to nautilus or to
mask the xroot nautilus window for fvwm as a plain xroot window? 
Is this question for fvwm comunity people or for nautilus developers?
(Or there is a another file manager for gnome2 with support of icons
on the desktop? :-))

Best regards
FH

ROX-Filer can have a similar "problem". What happens is that Nautilus is
taking over control of the root-window. There is probably a setting in
there (as there is for ROX-Filer) to pass mouse bindings back to the
underlying WM.

There may well be some kind of EWMH you could try to use (man fvwm).

Never having used natilus, I wouldn't know where to look for that, but I
would assume there is. Furthermore, I don't think FVWM has a
"root-window-override" mechanism (perhaps that goes against ICCM2.0?).

Kind Regards,

Hi!

Is there a way to iconify a specific window? Eg. I've started gaim on
startup, and I want to minimize it say after 5 secs.
StartIconic is not a solution here, because gaim will deiconify itself,
if an event occurs. And events WILL occur at startup.

In general how can I execute a command in a specific window context?

thx

Usually, you just click on the iconify button on the window title.
I'm not exactly sure what your problem is.  Is it because all gaim
windows are iconified when you iconify that window?  In this case
the following style might help:

  Style * IconifyWindowGroupsOff

If the problem is timing, you can use the Schedule command to
delay execution of the iconify command:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Schedule 5000 1 Next (name_of_target_window) Iconify on

(you need fvwm-2.5.x for the Schedule command).

Ciao

Arrgghh :)

You fail to read the FAQ. Take a look at the fvwm FAQ (number 3.18), found
here:

http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/faq/#3.18

However, the following code should work:

----------------------------------------
   *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: Cmd
     *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: PassId
     *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: StartDelay 4
     *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window FuncIconify_Window

     DestroyFunc FuncIconify_Window
     AddToFunc   FuncIconfify_Window
     + I WindowId $0 ("My Window") Iconfify

     AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow
------------------------------------------------------------------

Where ("My Window") is the name of the window you want to iconify. As for
waiting 5 mins *after*, umm.....not sure :)

Hi,

I use an IconMan swallowed in FvwmButton that only show current page
windows, and have "Style * NoIcon"
in my .fvwm2rc.
Alt-Tab is bound to "Next [CurrentPage] Focus".
Cycling through windows with Alt-Tab works great... except that when I
iconify one window, I cannot cycle to it by Alt-Tab, even though it appears
in IconMan.
This makes sense (no Icon for the window = nothing to Focus on), but I'd
like to know if there is some way to solve this, i.e. have Alt-Tab bound to
some function that would focus my
IconMan-swallowed-iconified-windows-that-do-not-have-Icons in addition of
any other windows.

The best I could come up so far was to remove Style * NoIcon, and use
invisible icons by setting: 

Style * IconSize 0 0 0 0    # Size 0 picture
Style * IconTitleColorset 3 # Transparent colorset
Style * HilightIconTitleColorset 3
Style * IconTitleRelief 0

But the icon text still show... and this is an awful kludge for such a great
WM.

Thanks,

Seb

I just tried:

Style * NoIconTitle
Style * IconSize 0 0 0 0

This did not work either... No icon, but no focus by Alt-Tab

I was wondering if any of you are willing to share you fvwm2rc files.

I have been trying to figure out what all this stuff does and it is nice
to see what other people are doing too..

Did some searching on the web at various rc files and many of them seem
really old.  

Also, does anyone have a screenshot of FvwmButtons...I want to see it in
action.

I really like how the Documentation page is improving (I need all the
help I can get)

Thanks

I like my FvwmButtons. There is a screenshot at

http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~dhansen/fvwm.png

It has several swallowed apps (xosview, xbuffy, dclock
and two window manager applets) and swallowed Fvwm
modules.

The "erotic, violence and cute" wallpaper is from

http://momonekodou.cool.ne.jp/mad-lovers/

The fvwm.rc as well as some mini icons and the window
decorations is in

http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~dhansen/fvwm.tgz

You can get a lot more very nice window decoration
From=20http://fvwm-themes.sf.net

But be warned, the configuration file isn't well
commented and may need some minor fixes.  You will
need fvwm > 2.5 for it (get it from cvs, don't worry
about stability, it's working very well).

Regards,

David

You may go to http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/ and get up to date
configurations.

A little bit more discrete version of FvwmButtons can be seen in the top
left corner of http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~remko/fvwm/screenshot2.png
The 3 buttons contain panels that fold in and out (the first one is my
IM client, the second one is my IRC window, and the third one is a
remote SSH session which i keep open at all times, and frequently use)
It can be seen in action on
    http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~remko/fvwm/buttons.gif

cheers,
Remko

   IIRC there is a setting in nautilus about desktop (root window) control

Hello, all,

This is really odd, I wonder if anyone can shed any light on the subject.
Since I use vim on an aterm a lot, I decided that it would be a good idea
to create a keyboard shortcut for it.  I did it like so:

Key v   A SCM Exec exec aterm -name vim -e vim

added to my fvwm2rc file (well, actually, to a separate file that holds all
my keybindings, and that is read by fvwm by the Read command).  All looks
good, except when I decide to save and quit (via :wq).  Then fvwm crashes.
Has anyone seen this happen before?  Any ideas why this might happen?

PS:  This happens when 'aterm -name vim -e vim &' is called from another
aterm.

What version of Fvwm are you using?

Is Fvwm producing any messages?

Are you sure its Fvwm crashing and not X?

Can you get a core file and provide a stack trace?

   nothing to do with your actual question but why not use gvim? it's 
pretty much the same except of better colors, better mouse use...

Hi!

Just wondering if anyone knows what can cause applications not to listen
to Style-commands? I'm having difficulties with the Debian package of
MozillaFirebird. However, when I tried the binary on
http://www.mozilla.org/ it works just fine so it must be something with
the Debian build. I recall something that it has something to do with
the fact that they built it against GTK 2.0?

thanks (will try that).  I'm aware that it's doing some unusual things,
but am reluctant to rewrite it...

2.5.6 is easier to get, and does work.  (I was confused by the recent
Changelog date for 2.4.16, thinking that it was recent, but see that it
is not).

 We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief =

outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband =
was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  =
thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm =
Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, =
my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three 
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke =
sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church =

churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  =
that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that =
Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don=92t want my =
husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don=92t want a =

where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. =
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =

happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to =
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =

you.

I always wondered why people spend so much time configuring all aspects
of a look, but do not improve such basic thing like their terminal.
If a bold font is not specified using -fb option (or similar), than the
terminal usually makes the bold font itself from the normal one.
This looks pretty ugly, the real bold font is better.

So, for example, if someone starts xterm like this:

  xterm -geometry 80x40 -sb +sk -si -sl 4096 -j -ls +lc -fn 7x14

the following addition makes it look nicer:

  xterm -geometry 80x40 -sb +sk -si -sl 4096 -j -ls +lc -fn 7x14 -fb 7x14bold


Another issue, actually a question. Maybe someone here knows the answer.

It seems that in xterm from XFree86-4.3.0, if you use +bdc or resource:

  XTerm*colorBDMode: true

then the bold font is not used, only the bold color is used. In 4.2.x
both bold color and font were used and I like this. Is this a bug or a
new (mis)feature? Is there a way to have both this setting and bold font?

Regards,
Mikhael.

netscape -iconic

works fine under metacity (for example) but not fvwm (using 4.79 version 
of netscape for speed reasons under Red Hat Linux 8.0).

Under fvwm [fvwm 2.5.7 compiled on May 30 2003 at 20:29:15
with support for: ReadLine, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Bidi text, 
Xinerama, XRender, XFT, NLS] the netscape always pops open its first 
window. It looks as if it tries to start iconic but then for some reason 
deiconifies straight away.

I read that the fvwm Inconic setting does not work for netscape, but that 
netscape -iconic does. I have tried all combinations and none works.

Anyone have a fix?

I would like to use fvwm with my more or less stock RH 8.0 install on a 
laptop. 

I currently use gnome/metacity because kde is way too resource heavy for 
the screen and interface to give decent responsivity. But metacity lacks 
several features in fvwm that I have enjoyed previously.

fvwm -r & works marvelously but for one thing: what fvwmrc should one use?

Does anyone have a minimalistic .fvwmrc file that is appropriate for 
gnome? I don't want to have to totally rebuild the panel and menus etc in 
fvwm. All I want is to use fvwm as my window manager. How do I get it to 
play nicely with gnome? Example: what is the relationship between fvwm's 
desktops and the gnome desktops? They aren't the same it seems. Each gnome 
desktop seems to be split into multiple fvwm desktops (or is it vice 
versa).

Anyway what folks like me who mostly want to do work with their computers,
not hack around with the window manager, need is a simple starting .fvwmrc
for working with gnome. Can anyone offer one?

With fvwm-2.5.8 (from cvs) and Netscape 3, "netscape -iconic" works
without problems. It is started iconic.

If you start fvwm without any configuration, like "fvwm -f no-config",
does "netscape -iconic" work? f it does not work, it is possible that you
run some netscape wrapper script that discards its arguments.

Alternativelly, it is possible to start any netscape iconic by adding:

  Style Navigator StartIconic

But it causes all new subwindows to be started iconified too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The following demonstrates that with no config, and with a direct run of 
the netscape 4.79 executable, netscape -iconic does not start up iconized.

However, I did not try 
>   Style Navigator StartIconic

I tried

which did not work.

This gives me bold fonts + bold colors with XFree86-4.3.0.
XTerm*boldColors:           on
XTerm*boldMode:             on
XTerm*colorBDMode:          on

'False' and 'True' don't seem to work here...

I can't stand bold fonts here :-D. so I have it set to:
XTerm*boldColors:           on
XTerm*boldMode:             off
XTerm*colorBDMode:          on

I think you need Netscape 4.  (I have 4.78).
It starts iconic, but uniconifies itself soon afterward.

I'm not having much luck trying to write a function with "Wait".

Nope, this does not work for me. (I surely tried these before asking.)

Once colorBDMode is set, the bold font is not used anymore.
Changed the class name to disallow the settings in ~/.Xdefaults and
the system app-defaults/XTerm:

  xterm -class NoThing -xrm '*colorBDMode: on'

No bold font. But at least, you got it, so there is a chance it is a bug.

  xterm -v
  XFree86 4.2.99.903(174)

Ok, i didn't see that part in the manpage. 

However, there is some behaviour which i don't understand: when i start
xterm -fn 7x14, i get an xterm where bold fonts are clearly not
generated by tracing the normal font, the bold font is clearly 7x14bold. 
Running xterm -fn 7x14 -fb 7x14bold gives me the exact same result.

Maybe XTerm has some predefined corresponding bold fonts for standard
fonts ?

So, these make no difference.

cheers,
Remko

PS: I personally don't like the 7x14-7x14bold combination. The bold font
is narrower (but bolder), and it looks like 2 different fonts in 1
terminal. I seem to prefer the 'generated' font.

The 2.5.x versions are from the development branch and 2.4.x is
the stable branch.  We are working on both branches in parallel.

I don't know why this happens out of the box.  I think it may be
because(?) X does not allow to focus windows that are not mapped,
i.e. it can not focus anything if there is not at least an icon
window somewhere.

However, I have attached a transparent 1x1 pixmap to this mail
that should help to fix the problem:

  Style ** Icon transparent.xpm
  Style * IconOverride, Icon transparent.xpm, NoIconTitle

(you may have to restart fvwm to make this work).

Several possiblilities

 - Its windows are initially created without a title, class or
   resource and are renamed only after styles have been applied.
   Try to find our the original settings of the windows.
 - The application overrides the style settings.  This is only
   possible for a few styles.  Try disabling gnome and ewmh hints
   for the application.

I can reproduce the problem, but I don't think we can do much
about it.  I see the netscape icon appear, but it deiconifies
itself immediately.  I don't think we can do anything about it.

It seems that xterm is aware if some font pairs, so if you specify
-fn 7x13, it will assume -fb 7x14. However for the default "fixed" font
(that happens to be the same 7x13 font) there is no pair, so the bold
font is generated by overstriking like in your screenshot.

Yes, in modern versions it is the same... Hovewer in previous versions
(I don't remember which) xterm did not try to match the corresponding
bold font, but always used overstriking.

Ok, it is a matter of a habit. For me, the real font is more an art work
that looks nice, the generated font looks a bit like a crap without
anti-aliasing, especially for wide letters. :)

I would think that too, but weird enough in this case my preference goes out 
to the other way. I have tried other font settings in the past (such as
anti-aliased fonts), but i always come back to the default. An
anti-aliased font would be nice, but i haven't found one which renders
nice at such small point sizes.

Remko

Hi,

I've always had problems using PNG icons with FVWM, despite it being 
built correctly (fvwm-configure shows png support as 'yes').  My machine 
was recently upgraded to Solaris 8 (or 2.8 depending on nomenclature) 
and I was hoping that by rebuilding the latest beta FVWM (2.5.7) that 
I'd find PNGs to now work.  But unfortunately they still do not.  Then I 
just noticed this CVS update that was done on 6/6.


CVSROOT:	/home/cvs/fvwm
Module name:	fvwm
Changes by:	olicha	03/06/06 10:44:04

Modified files:
	.              : ChangeLog
	libs           : PictureImageLoader.c

Log message:
* Fixed loading of png images if the caller want no alpha


I built the snapshot from June 7, but not only do PNGs not display 
still, but I'm having other problems.

What's a good, stable snapshot on Solaris that would include any updates 
related to PNG?

All I'm doing by the way is a simple line like this:

Style "xterm" myicon.png

No other PNG related lines in my .fvwm2rc file.  That's it.  Yet, when I 
iconify an xterm window, I get no icon and this is the output

*FvwmConsole version 2.5.7
[FVWM][GetIconFromFile]: <<ERROR>> Failed to load /path/to/my/pngfile.png

The path is certainly correct, and I've tried using other PNGs with the 
same problem.  I'm also able to view them with no problem with GIMP. 
It's only within FVWM that there's this problem.

Any help getting PNGs working with Solaris is much appreciated.

Thank you,
Ben

GNOME2 does not support large desktop. If you use the gnome pager you
should use a 1x1 desktop, i.e., add

	DesktopSize 1 1

to your config.

Unfortunately, I do not use a simple .fvwmrc. I use fvwm-themes
(http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/). If you want to try it with GNOME2, I
suggest you use the current cvs. It has a minimal support for GNOME2
(e.g., you get fvwm-themes menus even with nautilus running via "Alt
Mouse x"). With the fvwm-themes menu you can disable all visible
module (as some FvwmButtons): Theme Management -> Current -> modules
-> *. Also, you can add session support: Theme Management -> settings
-> session manager. For using fvwm-themes, after installation  you
should add the line

fvwm-themes-start --no-start

just before the line which invokes gnome-session and use
the following minimal config file:

[olivier@snoopy olivier]$ cat ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
Read themes-rc
[olivier@snoopy olivier]$

Hi all, just wondering if fvwm.org was still accepting screenshots and
fvwmrc files? If so, could I get the address to send them to, and any
criteria? I couldn't seem to find it on the site.

Hi there,

I am forced to use fvwm 2.4.6. Is there a know problem with FvwmEvent in
this version? I experienced a really annoying flashing when using FvwmEvent with
the following setup:

DestroyFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
AddToFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
+ I Current (!CurrentPage) Prev (CurrentPage, !Iconified, !Sticky) Focus

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent: new_page CurrentPageFocusFunc 
*FvwmEvent: new_desk CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window CurrentPageFocusFunc

Any ideas?

Cheers, Uwe

Hi there,

I am forced to use fvwm 2.4.6. Is there a know problem with FvwmEvent in
this version? I experienced a really annoying flashing when using FvwmEvent
with
the following setup:

DestroyFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
AddToFunc CurrentPageFocusFunc
+ I Current (!CurrentPage) Prev (CurrentPage, !Iconified, !Sticky) Focus

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent: new_page CurrentPageFocusFunc 
*FvwmEvent: new_desk CurrentPageFocusFunc
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window CurrentPageFocusFunc

Any ideas?

Cheers, Uwe

Why?  I can't imagine anything except insufficient disk space or
lack of internet connection, floppy drive and cd rom drive.

All known problems have been fixed in the later 2.4.x versions.
Check the NEWS for 2.4.16.

Fixed.  Changing the focus caused a new_page event.

I can't say anything on the subject (PNG on Solaris), just some notes.

The latest cvs is always thought to be prefereable, at least in the
feature freeze period.

> *FvwmConsole version 2.5.7

It should say 2.5.8 (from cvs) if it is really the snapshot from June 7.

Can you please build the latest cvs, so we don't speak about past
versions, and install it using "make install". Verify that fvwm-config
--info lists png support and you run the correct executable.

Actually, you don't even need to install anything to verify the png
support in FVWM. After "make", just run bin/fvwm-root with your png file
to see whether it works, it should set the root background.

Regards,
Mikhael.

;-) Or a quite secure system, which does not allow you anything except doing
your work. I am quite happy that I have fvwm 2.4.6. Otherwise I would have
to cope with OpenWindows or even worse KDE3.

That explains it. So there is no workaround?

BTW: I apologize for the doubled mails and the missing subject. I have write
my mails via a web interface which is quite annoying if one is used to mutt
:-\

Hope it is not in the FAQ:

I want to set up fvwm to be able to switch languages in windows
independent.
(perhaps it should be in the faq :) What do you think?)

I guess the answer will be FvwmEvent again, if no smarter solution
exists...

Change the function.  Make it flip the focus only if no window on
the current page has the focus.

Yeah, it barely made it past my mental spam filter :-)

[fvwm-root] failed to load image file '~/bin/fvwm-icons/dtterm.png'

I'm not quite sure why this would be happening.  Perhaps it's finding 
the libpng-1.0.1 png.h file from a system wide directory before finding 
my local 1.2.5 png.h file.  Maybe I just need to reorder my 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  Any suggestions?

thanks,
Ben

You shouldn't try to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Use "-R libname" during build, set it using LD_OPTIONS.

In version 2.4.6 the !Focused and !CurrentPage conditions seem not to
exists. It does not work an it is not mentioned in the man page.

I do use LD_OPTIONS to use "-L libname -R libname", and I do use 
"--with-png-includes=mypath/lib-png-1.2.5/include" with configure too.

Yet somehow it's using a png.h from libpng-1.0.1.  The png.h in 
'mypath/lib-png-1.2.5/include' is indeed the png.h from 1.2.5, and my 
configure.log shows it finding the png.h from that directory and not 
some other one.

this is really odd.

That's right.  You could hack a shell script that checks these
conditions and call it with PipeRead:

  Current PipeRead <script> \
    $vp.x $vp.y $vp.width $vp.height \
    $w.x  $w.y  $w.width  $w.height
  None <focus as usual>

(script checks whether window is on current page or not).

Ciao

Ladies and Gents: Hi ...

Glad to be back here :) ...

I left the list several months ago after I bought an Apple PowerBook
G4 with Mac OS X on it, last December.

After some months of playing OS X I installed Linux to this Mac: I
thought Mac OS X is not the town I'd like to live in.

So currently I have both systems installed on this machine: OS X and
Debian (3.0.r1), and, sure, my favorite xmachine: FVWM (2.4.16) ... :)

I hope to be able to compile fresh .deb packages on this mac, 'tho I
definitely don't have the slightest idea how arcane the methods are to
do this on a Debian Linux: I remember it to be very easy to build my
own RPM's on my old RedHat 6.2, running on an i386.
This time I'm on Debian-Linux now, running on a PowerPc ... :)

So let's hope I can be of some help with !new! deb. packages built on,
and for, powerpc, sooner or later ... :)

And yes: I'll be here with questions, too. Sure ... :)

Until soon.

Best regards,
Wolfgang

Hello,

first, thanks for such a cool module.


is it the right place to talk about it ?

one feature i'd like (as a function, or button, or default behavior) :
resize all tabbed windows to the size of the current tabbed window.

this way, when switching, fvwmtabs won't have to expand / shrink the size
of its windows and thus be faster and less confusing for the eye...


(i use fvwmtabs particulary for xterms)

thanks

This is still confusing me.  I even checked my Makefile and the path to 
my png.h seems correct.

png_CFLAGS = -I/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/include
png_LIBS = -lpng -lz

Yet after I make everything I get that warning that fvwm-root was 
compiled with png.h from libpng-1.0.1.  Could some other system path, 
such as /usr/local/include, be overriding my local path?  How could I 
force it to find the png.h of 1.2.5 from my local directory?

thanks,
Ben

Did you search your system for other copies of the library?  If
there is one, try moving it to some obscure place to see if it is
used.  If there is none, your libpng must be broken.  Perhaps the
installed header files do not match the library?

P.S.:  Please don't post your replies at the top of your mails on
this list.

I am sorry GNOME 2.4 supports large desktop. However, there are some
bugs in fvwm. This is fixed in the current cvs and so for 2.5.8 and
future snapshots.

Yes, there are other copies of the png.h header file in 
/usr/local/include, but since I do not have root access to this system, 
I can't simply move this copy.  Is there any system variable that I 
could use to set the include path?  I need to have the compiler search 
in my local directories prior to searching in system wide directories , 
such as /usr/local/include.

Thanks

Hello,

first, thanks for such a cool module.


is it the right place to talk about it ?

one feature i'd like (as a function, or button, or default behavior) :
resize all tabbed windows to the size of the current tabbed window.

this way, when switching, fvwmtabs won't have to expand / shrink the size
of its windows and thus be faster and less confusing for the eye...


(i use fvwmtabs particulary for xterms)

btw, i'd like to package fvwm cvs, fvwmtabs and X11::protocol
for debian. is someone already working on it ?

thanks

ps : this might be a repost, sorry in this case.

I copied the png include files to the fvwm directory where I was running 
'make' and that seems to have forced it to use the correct version of 
png.h.  I finally have PNG support with FVWM!  Thanks.

Hi together,
I just wrote somehting I was missing since a long time. It isn't
directly related to screen but nice to have in the envrionment.

What it does? You press CTRL SHIFT ALT + 0 - 9 get a crosshair and klick
on an X Application. If you want to switch to that application again you
press CTRL SHIFT + 0 - 9 ... that's it.

For more documentation have a look at 'perldoc ./quickselect'.

Greetings,
	Thomas

I think it has a bug, it assumes window ids have 6 heximal digits after
0x. They may have (and usually have) 7 digits, but probably 5 and 8 too.

What is the problem with this configuration that does the same without
any external tools (quickselect, xwininfo), I posted it some time ago:

  Key 1 A SCM  Key 1 A SC  WindowId $[w.id] WindowListFunc
  Key 9 A SCM  Key 9 A SC  WindowId $[w.id] WindowListFunc

(In fvwm versions less than 2.4.16 you should use "WindowListFunc $$w").

Mikhael.

This works on focused window if any. IMHO, it is faster and easier.
To always force the crosshair like in your variant, you may use:

  Key 1 A SCM  NoWindow Pick  Key 1 A SC  WindowId $$[w.id] WindowListFunc

Hi to all FVWM:ers!
And to PowerPC Linux users!
So I am not the only one using FVWM on Mac. :)

I suggest you use the CVS version. Debian has package
info on their site on doing .debs.

So you have a PB G4! Well I guess it's slightly faster than my 8500/120... ;)
First thing to do on a G5 is to compile FVWM!

Did you check out Yellow Dog Linux? I got YDL 2.3.
On 32 MB RAM, no extra Video card. :)

Tell us more about Debian and FVWM on a Mac.

First, is it me or do FvwmIconBox, FvwmIconMan, FvwmTaskBar and
FvwmWinList all do similar things?

Second, I would like to create a Windows/Gnome style toolbar which
would have the usual collection of fixed-size utilities (Main menu,
Desktop switcher, Clock) with a task-switcher filling up the rest of
the space dynamically resizing its windows as appropriate.

A combination of the above four and FvwmButtons seem to do roughly what I
want but I can't work out how to do *exactly* what I want!

All help appreciated.

Thanks

John

Hi there,

I'm running XDarwin 1.2.0 under MacOS X and have just used fink to
upgrade the version of fvwm2 that I use.

The problem is that, after doing this upgrade, I can no longer launch
an xterm within fvwm.  My .xinitrc is relatively simple, at the end I
have:

xterm -sb -sl 500 --geometry 75x34+687+40 &
exec ssh-agent fvwm2

The xterm mentioned here launches fine, but if I try and launch an
xterm from within fvwm2 the window appears, but is completely blank -
hitting enter causes the window to disappear.  This happens using the
default .fvwm2rc or my own, which defines the command to launch the
xterm as follows:

+	 "xterm" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -sb -sl 500

Note that curiously I can open emacs, start a shell and launch an
xterm from within here, all with no problems.

Can anyone suggest what is happening here?

Thanks

Good evning!

I've created a nice bar using FvwmButtons which I'm really pleased with.
For this bar I use StaysOnTop, I also use MinOverlapPercentPlacement as
default placement. I would however like to go even further than
StaysOnTop; is it possible to make the bar space totaly clean, meaning
no other windows can be placed there, not even on another layer? Like a
really thick EdgeResistance on that window... :-)

Regards,

I just noticed in the man page the MinOverlapPlacementPenalties style,
you might want to read up on that, and Ewmh struts in the man page...

Hello,

I'm running Fvwm 2.2 with Fvwm2-i18n on FreeBSD 4.8. My problem is that I 
cannot see the special danish characters in the menus. When I use a special 
danish character then that and every character after it disappers. Why?

Thanks
/Peter

Also noticed there is something interesting called
EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea. I've read the documentation on this a few
times but can't get it to work. If someone knows how to setup this (the
bar is at 30+0-0) feel free to help. :-)

I just tried "xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT" followed by clicking at the
FvwmButtons, but no numbers appear. Is there a solution to this?

As the message says, you have to install the X11 development
libraries.

If you tell us what kind of system you have, someone might
be able to give you more specific instructions.

 ... not being sure on it: which docs do you mean? I think I read this
one:

<http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-helpers.en.html#s-equivs>

I never built CVS stuff ... I had a look to
<http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_cvs.php>
and, (how do I say this politely :) ... <errh>, let's say the first 10
or 15 lines didn't lure me into reading the rest of the page ...

But it's late at night now. I'll have another look at it tomorrow or
so perhaps .. :)

No. I read about it, as I did on Gentoo Linux. In the end I simply
took Debian for reasons I forgot. Perhaps I thought Debian is more
secure, stable than other Linux distros. But I'm not sure on that
anymore. If I had to choose again I might try Gentoo Linux, simply for
curiosity .. :)

Wow ...  :)

The basic install was cool: Even for a Debian beginner as I am, it was
relatively easy to get Debian installed to the TiBook (although I'd
guess it's still a bit too much for an absolute Linux Newbie to
install Debian to a Mac ... Sorry, Debian developers ... :) Actually
I would have preferred to install RedHat to the machine: I simply
chose Debian for the lack of an available powerpc RedHat distro.

And yes: Another reason I actually wanted RedHat for the Mac was the
RedHat mailing list; there were (and they're probably still there)
some cool, friendly folks on this list, with a, most of the time,
very problem guided approach to Linux.

As to FVWM: Shortly before I installed Debian to the TiBook some
months ago I saw Gnome and KDE on a i386 Debian, resp. on a Knoppix
Live CD on the same machine: It was both KDE and Gnome which convinced
me to a considerable extent that FVWM might be again the Window
manager of my choice for the, at this time, already planned
installation on the Powerbook :) ...

I wouldn't send Bill Gates away, if he'd be knocking on my door.
Actually I'd ask him whether he would like to sponsor my Linux
sessions in front of my Mac ... no kidding: I'd ask him .... :)

Best Regards,
Wolfgang

You want FvwmButtons with a swallowed FvwmIconMan.

Here's an improved version of the script in the FAQ.  This time,
you can specify a "show" delay separately.  If you have a 2.5.x
version prior to current CVS (i.e. 2.5.8), you have to replace
"TestRc" with "Cond" (the command was renamed).

     AddToFunc autohide
     + I ThisWindow ($0) Deschedule $[w.id]
     + I TestRc (!Match) Deschedule -$[w.id]
     + I ThisWindow ($0) ThisWindow (shaded) autohide_show $1 $3
     + I TestRc (!Match) All ($0, !shaded) autohide_hide $2 $3

     AddToFunc autohide_show
     + I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] WindowShade $1 off
     + I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] Deschedule $[w.id]
     + I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] Deschedule -$[w.id]

Because fvwm-2.2 has no I18N support.  You should upgrade to the
latest stable release (2.4.16).

First, I'd like to voice a minor complaint about fvwm.org:

I definitely appreciate the software patent protest (and certainly hope
Europe doesn't end up in the same terrible mess the US currently has),
but the site code does not remember whether you've gone past the
introductory "page closed" page.  This isn't a big deal for most of the
pages, but it breaks the screenshots page (can't advance past the first
group of screenshots unless you do so manually) as well as the themes
(theme is lost when the "page closed" intro is displayed.)

Secondly, I have a question:
Is it possible to have FvwmIconMan group windows by their class?  While
I'd ideally like to start doing this (vs. normal behavior) when there
are more than X entries to be drawn, I wouldn't mind doing it all the
time.  (I'm using 2.5 from CVS.)

I'm thinking that something along these lines might be possible,
although I'm uncertain after a quick read of the manual:  a 'main'
IconMan could show each distinct class name, and then a transient
FvwmIconMan could be spawned from a mouse binding.  While spawning the
transient FvwmIconMan is easy enough to figure out, I don't see any
obvious way to show only distinct classes in the main icon manager.

If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, please let me know--I may make a
patch to add this behavior if it's not currently possible.

Thanks,

Hi,

: Just to know what you think about this message.

Thanks, I've been inundated with 1000's of spam emails in the last
couple of days & must have missed your post on the FVWM list in the cleanup.

: first, thanks for such a cool module.

Glad you like it.

: is it the right place to talk about it ?

Yup. The fvwm-workers@fvwm.org list might be more appropriate if
discussions get more technical.

: one feature i'd like (as a function, or button, or default behavior) :
: resize all tabbed windows to the size of the current tabbed window.
: 
: this way, when switching, fvwmtabs won't have to expand / shrink the size
: of its windows and thus be faster and less confusing for the eye...

Ok, I will add it in the next version. I am heading o/s tomorrow so
give me 2 weeks.

: btw, i'd like to package fvwm cvs, fvwmtabs and X11::protocol
: for debian. is someone already working on it ?

Not to my knowledge - go for your life. FvwmTabs is GPL s/w.

I have modified X11:Protocol to make it (& FvwmTabs) more robust (for
the unreleased FvwmTabs v2.1). I sent a small patch to the author (Stephen)
some time ago but haven't heard back - I was considering distributing
my own (patched) version of X11::Protocol with FvwmTabs (until Stephen
patches X11::Protocol). I'm not sure how much this will complicate
things for you.

Have a serene day,

SCoTT. :)

Summary: fvwm must respond to focus changes and store information about
window-keymap relationships.

When I change keymap, while focus in a window, fvwm should remember the
keymap associated to that window.
When I leave the window, fvwm should restore the keymap what was before.
When I return to that window, fvwm should change to the remembered
keymap.

So: If I fire up several xterms, (keymap was english before), every
xterm should will work with english keymap.

Then, I start to write a Hungarian letter in an xterm, so I press
_whatever_key_ to change the keymap to hu. Then, I switch to another
xterm, and start to write a German letter (and switch the keyboard with
the keyboard before, of course)...

Now, when I switch back to my Hungarian letter, I can continue typing,
because fvwm changed my keyboard to Hungarian.
Then I switch to the German letter, and continue my German letter. Then,
I fire up a new xterm, and start typing... and expect an english keymap
(which is ideal for shells, programming...)

Understood.  What I do not understand is why the keymap should be
associated with windows.  At least on my keyboard, the labels on
the keys are not going to change when the focus is moved.

Hm.  Well, keymap management is not really in the scope of the
window manager, but with FvwmEvent you can solve this, however
inefficient that solution may be.  In the future, FvwmEvent may
move into the fvwm core, which should greatly improve its
performance.  I see no need to write a specific command to manage
keymaps.

As I said before, use FvwmButtons + FvwmIconMan:

1) Determine the grid size you need.  About 16x16 should usually
   do.  Then determine the size of the bar you need.  For example,
   if FvwmButtons is (screen width)x32 pixels:

     Style FvwmButtons BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, NoTitle
     *FvwmButtonsGeometry 1280x32+0-0
     *FvwmButtonsRows     2
     *FvwmButtonsColumns  80
     # forbid resizing
     *FvwmButtonsBoxSize  fixed

2) Determine which area should be used by FvwmIconMan.  For
   example, to let it fill all the height of the bar and stretch
   from grid space 10 to 69:

     *FvwmButtons: (60x3+10+0, Swallow FvwmIconMan 'Module FvwmIconMan')

3) Place the fixed buttons.  Override the button placement
   algorithm with explicit size/position args:

     *FvwmButtons: (3x2+0+1, ...)
     *FvwmButtons: (3x1+0+0, ...)
     ...

4) Configure FvwmIconMan (see man page).

I don't think FvwemIconMan can group windows inside one manager
window.  But if you know the window groups beforehand, you can
create a separate window for each of the groups.  Take a look at
the example at the end of the FvwmIconMan man page:

  *FvwmIconMan: NumManagers 2

  *FvwmIconMan: 1 Title           "Emacs windows"
  *FvwmIconMan: 1 Show            resource=emacs resource=gemacs
  *FvwmIconMan: 1 ManagerGeometry 1x0-400+0

  *FvwmIconMan: 2 Title           "All windows"
  *FvwmIconMan: 2 ManagerGeometry 2x4-0+0

It's not exactly what you described, but still better than
nothing.

Ok, I understand. I will use FvwmEvent, I just hoped sy. uses it that
way, or I can get a pointer to a good example...

I'll hack something and see, if it works...

I've no idea how to set this up but if you work it out PLEASE post it to

Hi!

I've noticed, that using some FvwmApplets doesn't look nice, or not
working, when you set locales.

Fvwm version 2.5.8 (from cvs)
Eg: DigitalClock gets output from date. Date's arguments depends on the
LANG environment variable. In the script, it just cut-n-paste some
characters.

But:
date's output (LANG unset)
Mon Sep 29 13:58:55 CEST 2003
date's output (LANG=3Dhu_HU)
2003. sze. 29., h=E9tf=F5, 14.00.23 CEST

I get h=E9tf=F5 for DigitalClock...

You should better not use a hyphen in the name and begin it with
a letter, e.g.

  SetEnv keymap$[w.id] ...

It's surprisingly difficult to do nested expansions.  This works:

  piperead "echo setenv tmp_keymap $$\\[keymap$[w.id]\\]"

Now you have the 

(Note: both functions must be called in a valid window context).

  Exec setxkbmap "$[tmp_keymap]"

So, here is my solution.
Shortcomings:
- different keys for different languages
- no "default" keyboard, if the window doesn't have own keymap.
  If you fire up fvwm, and an xterm, change the keymap in the xterm, and
  after that fire up a new xterm, then the keymap won't change back.

*FvwmEvent-LocalKeymap: focus_change RestoreKeymap
Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-LocalKeymap

DestroyFunc RestoreKeymap
AddToFunc RestoreKeymap
+ I Piperead "echo SetEnv tmp_keymap $$\\[keymap_$[w.id]\\]"
+ I Echo "Autoswitch to $[tmp_keymap] keyboard layout"

All FvwmScript configs named FvwmApplet-* belong to fvwm-themes.

Probably the font specified in the FvwmApplet-DigitalClock configuration
does not exist for your locale charset, I run:

  xlsfonts -fn '-*-lucida-bold-r-normal-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*'

and get that there are only iso10646-1, iso8859-1 and koi8-r versions.
If this is true for you too then you will obviously not see Hungarian
characters (they are not in iso8859-1, I guess). You may try to use
hu_HU.utf8 locale, then it should work. Alternativelly, you may try to
specify some existing Hungarian font (iso8859-2?), or even something
like this:

  Font StringEncoding=iso8859-2:-*-lucida-bold-r-normal-*-10-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1

Tell us if this works.

Mikhael.

You may search for "FvwmKb" in Google to see at least one solution.

Hello Dominik, 

I have the same problem, because I am using a franco-arabe 
Keyboard which have the french and araic Letters. 

I do development for Turkia, Iran/Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. 
So I have some Problems which can not handled by the OS, but 
maybe by the WindowManager.

Are you sure ?
And if I ask you very nice ?

seems to work well, might be nice to have a javascript counter to tell you how many votes you've used at the bottom of the page.

when i clicked on the link to the "log in page" i didn't get an option to log in, but the link below worked fine.

Phil.

p.s. what are the rules about voting on your own work? ;)

Just a note to everyone on the list, the logo voting is in the testing
stage currently. It is not open yet. It seem like Phil replied to this
address that happens to be this list by a mistake.

Everyone should vote for his own works, as usual. :)
