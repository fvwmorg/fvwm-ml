I could be wrong, but...
I have a comment in my .fvwm2rc that says:

# Geometry - really likes to pick its own size, but giving a position is OK
*FvwmButtonsGeometry -5-34

I believe my button size is determined by the size of the xpm images I
stuck in there.  The only button I have that's larger is xload and it's
double-sized.  Check this out:

*FvwmButtons(2x1, Title load, \
             Swallow(UseOld) "xload" 'Exec xload \
                     -nolabel -bg grey60 -update 5 -geometry -1500-1500 &')

Maybe something like that will work for you, too.
I hope this helps...

I think Fvwm requires all the buttons to be in some kind of ratio. (ie,252 is
not a multiple of 68)

> *MailBox: (Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "gkrellm" \ `Exec exec
> gkrellm` Size 68 252)

*MailBox: (1x4, Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "gkrellm" \ 
	`Exec exec gkrellm`)

will achieve something close to what you are looking for.

You can read about Containers.. maybe it'll help you achieve what you are
looking for with a couple of  blank buttons ensuring that'll pad gkrellm (top
and bottom) to achieve some kind of ratio relationship.

Well, this is not correct. I don't think you want this binding to work
when you are on a window title only. So don't do "T", but "A" (anywhere)
instead. Then the next argument should be one letter modifiers, C means
Ctrl, M means Meta or Alt, S means Shift. So in my example above you
should press Ctrl-Alt-F5. (Note that in some OSes this combination of
keys, Ctrl-Alt-F5, is reserved for switching to the virtual console number
5, in this case use Shift-Ctrl or anything other you want).

  Key N  A  SC  Next (XTerm) MyFocusAndRaise  # press Shift-Ctrl-N

If this is a Windows related problem, you should definitely ask the list
not me, I don't run Windows.

Nothing like this is required. It is only that if it is a multiple of 68
all proportions may be reduced to 1x1 and so on, but this is optional.
The above may be reduced as well: 17x17, 17x63.

I suggest to use ButtonGeometry to specify the exact size of 1x1 button.
For example try:

  *FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 4x4-0+0
  *FvwmButtons: (17x17, ...)
  *FvwmButtons: (17x63, ...)

Mikhael.

Hello.

Currently I have in my .fvwm2rc file

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
AddToFunc SelectWindow
+ I Focus
+ I Iconify false
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 8p

Key Tab A M Next [*] SelectWindow
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

and I can cycle through windows using M-Tab and choose
the one I want raised and focused. But I am not happy
with the order of the windows when cycling through the
available ones. I want them ordered with the most
recently focused on top.

Also I would like to not have the windows raised
while cycling through them, until I stop cycling,
that is, until I have chosen the window I want.
Is it possible to just present the name/icon of the
window while cycling, and only raise and focus the
chosen one?

Any clues on how to achieve these?

Ohhhh...so he could specify the geometry like:

*FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 68x68-0+0

...and then for the larger button, he could put:

*MailBox: (1x4, Swallow(UseOld,NoHints,Respawn) "gkrellm" \
                `Exec exec gkrellm`)

...and get rid of the other 68x68 geometry calls and it'll probably do
what he wants?  Well, it'd be 68x272 instead of 252, but...close enough
for government work?

Do I understand you right?

I should build my own taskbar by using FvwmButtons that swallows all 
things I want (in my case a FvwmPager)? Can FvwmIconMan be configured 
that it behaves the same way as FvwmTaskBar (with onmouse-over-bubbles, 
etc.)?

Thanks,

Gert

Hello,

I am experimenting with conditional commands and trying to close the 
currently focused window when clicking on the root window with mouse 
button 3.

Mouse 3 R A Current iconify

or

Mouse 3 R A All (Focused) iconify

do not work. They result in a beep only. I also tried some other 
conditional key words but did not find the right one. What am I doing wrong?

(using fvwm 2.5.5+x -- a CVS checkout from one week ago)

Thanks,

Gert

I am not sure whether this is a rhetorical question or not. Yes, it would
be close enough to the Michael's needs. My example above gives the exact
sizes. As well as the following:

  *FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 1x1-0+0
  *FvwmButtons: Columns 68  # it is vertical
  *FvwmButtons: (68x68, ...)
  *FvwmButtons: (68x252, ...)

Mikhael.

Hi FVWMers!

I use the follwing functions to adapt newly created Windows to fullscreen size.

*FvwmEvent-NewWindow: Cmd
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow: PassId
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window AddWindow

AddToFunc StartFunction
	+ I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow

AddToFunc FullScreen
	+ I ThisWindow (!Maximized) Style $n BorderWidth 0
	+ I ThisWindow ( Maximized, !"bluescreen") Style $n BorderWidth 1
	+ I ThisWindow Maximize
	+ I ThisWindow (!Maximized) WarpToWindow -5p -5p

AddToFunc AddWindow
	+ I Piperead "ls -al / &> /dev/null"
	+ I Piperead "ls -al / &> /dev/null"
	+ I WindowId $0 ("MAINscreen")    FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("LOCALscreen")   FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("DEVELscreen")   FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("CONSOLEscreen") FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("Opera*")        FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("Gvim")          FullScreen
	+ I WindowId $0 ("Go to page")    WarpToWindow -10 -50

If I now restart FVWM, FvwmEvent gets some add_window events and tries to resize
them which ends in ununsable windows. They get a little bit smaller then
fullscreen and have borders. So my question is there a way to tell FvwmEvent to
wait ... when restarting until all events caused by the Restart are over?

Yes, developers prefer not to have a duplicating functionality. Ideally
there should be 2 very configurable modules, one for the dynamical list of
windows (let's call it FvwmIconMan for now) and one for the button layout
(let's call it FvwmButtons). FvwmPager is something different, but if you
prefer it to the list of windows - you may swallow it too.

Balloons are not available in FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan, but you wanted
to add some code to FvwmTaskBar, am I right? So I suggest, instead, to
work on missing features of FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan. I would think
adding balloons is easier than adding such features like button layout
and swallowing (that are already available in FvwmButtons).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, you will find it if you search the FwmmEvent man page for "delay".
You need StartDelay.

I don't think you are doing anything wrong.

It seems that any root binding that results in an operation on a window
is broken in 2.5.6.

  Mouse 3 R S Iconify                               # broken
  Mouse 3 R S Next (Focused) Iconify                # broken
  Mouse 3 T S Iconify                               # ok
  Mouse 3 R S Next (Focused) Exec xmessage $[w.id]  # ok

You want to use WindowList. Try to remove this Key line and use the
default Alt-Tab or give WindowList your own arguments.

There was a partial answer. Here is how to do this without gaps (taken
from fvwm-themes). Note that there are always gaps with xterm and similar.

For 2.4.x (two keys):

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize false 
  + I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5

  Key F11  A  SC Pick FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  Key F12  A  SC Pick FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen

For 2.5.6+ (one toggle key; it was "Border" earlier in 2.5.x):

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) Style $n Title, Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n NoTitle, !Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize

  Key F11  A  SC Pick FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen

This really looks good. But how do you call it from fvwm? The problem is 
that in fvwm the pages and desktops AFAIK do not have a name, they are 
just labeled in the FvwmPager module.

One (the only?) possible solution might be to call a small script with 
the desktop and page numbers and the script chooses the name to be printed.

Can this be done more generally so that it does work with not only 
xterms but with every type of window? Something like:

  ... Next (has same class as current) MyFocusAndRaise

Hello.

This has changed between 2.4.8 and 2.4.14.

When using 'Style * NoIcon' (or NoIconTitle) iconified windows
no longer show up in FvwmIconMan.

I have tried with 'IconBox none', 'Icon' and also read the
archives of this list since 2.4.8 was released and found no
solution.

What is the magic config to show my iconified windows in
FvwmIconMan but not pollute my Desktop?

--- fvwm2rc.m4 ---
[..]
Style "*"       StickyIcon, NoIcon, MiniIcon mini.x.xpm
[..]
*FvwmIconMan*Action Mouse 1     N SendCommand "Iconify Off", SendCommand Focus, SendComman
*FvwmIconMan*PlainButton        Flat
*FvwmIconMan*DrawIcons          True
*FvwmIconMan*FollowFocus        False
*FvwmIconMan*Format             "%t"
*FvwmIconMan*SelectButton       Up
*FvwmIconMan*Sort               Name

Hello,

I still have my pager on top of mplayer in fullscreen.  How to stop that ?

I compile 2.5.6 with :

- configure
- make

then I pkg with "checkinstall" and I call it "fvwm-unstable" like fvwm
2.5.5.

I then just dpkg it.  

How can I sure that I use fvwm 2.5.6 ?
How can I remove pager and iconman when mplayer is in full screen ?

thx

What version of mplayer do you have? It works for me. Get the newest Version.
There should.

Do you see something like that when going fullscreen?

	[whatever driver you use] original window layer is 4.
	[whatever driver you use] Layered style stay on top ( layer 10 ).

If not upgrade to newest MPlayer version.

It works great ! Thx ! :D

Just one thing : I have a tiny iconman on the top left of my screen. How
can I :

- maximize all screen but keep 24 pixels on the left for icon man ?
- be on the top of icon man ?

I have the last version of marillat.free.fr (debian mirror)

Now, it's strange because sometimes mplayer crash X when I start it for the
first time after a logon. 

I don't change anything to mplayer !  Only to fvwm !

Ho can I be sure that I use 2.5.6 and not 2.5.5 ?

Which version do you have? An actual server goes to layer 4 automatically? Could
you please send me in private whole copy of you .fvwm2rc?

> Now, it's strange because sometimes mplayer crash X when I start it for the

Same for me when using xv output. We should file a bug report. Do you have a
Nvidia Graphic Card?

> I don't change anything to mplayer !  Only to fvwm !

Newer mplayers change there layer automaically to layer 10 when they go
fullscreen. So you don't have to change anything to fvwm if it supports chaning
of layers. Otherwise you have to update fvwm.

> Ho can I be sure that I use 2.5.6 and not 2.5.5 ?
Open FvwmConsole ... and you get the version at the prompt.

To solve this problem - would you please provide the following things:

	What mplayer version do you use and what fvwm version.

	Does mplayer show you the follwoing when you start it with -fs
		[x11] original window layer is 4.
		[x11] Layered style stay on top ( layer 10 ).

	Send me a copy of your .fvwm2rc

Greetings,
	Thomas

I don't really understand, but when I start mplayer, it's layer 4 ! I don't
know how to check the layer of the fullscreen.

I hope that I send you enough informations.  It's really friendly from you
to help me !  Many thx !

I am not on the latest Nvidia Driver, but the version doesn't matter ... it keeps
crashing. Do you file a bugreport, or should I do? The problem is that this
isn't as reproducable as it should be.

This is the latest release.

Nice. Layers are fixed in this version.

> Once again : MPlayer 0.90rc4-2.95.4 and Fvwm 2.5.6

One time is enough. :-)

Okay you can check the layer while fullscreen if you simply press alt-tab or
whatever your WindowList is bound.

Mplayer tells you on stdout if he tries to change its default layer to window
10. This were the two lines I was refering to. But you have the latest Mplayer
version anyway.

> I hope that I send you enough informations.  It's really friendly from you
> to help me !  Many thx !
Yes, you did. - No problem. The problem is caused by us.


> Style "MPlayer" GnomeIgnoreHints
You have the line Style "MPlayer" GnomeIgnoreHints in you .fvwm2rc. This tells
.fvwm2rc to let Mplyer *not* change its layer ... so it stays on layer 4. Remove
that line restart and this should fix your problem.

The desktops do have names in 2.5.x using DesktopName command and it is
advised to use this instead of the FvwmPager's Label (i.e. remove all
"*FvwmPager: Label" lines in 2.5.x as redundant). Some modules including
FvwmPager and WindowList support these global names automatically.

The pages have no names, but they have coordinates.

Just installed
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/freshrpms/psyche/xosd/xosd-2.1.2-fr1.i386.rpm
Looks ok, here is how to use it in 2.5.6 (use $d in older 2.5.x versions):

  DesktopName 0 Main
  DesktopName 1 FVWM
  DesktopName 2 Work
  DesktopName 3 Fun

  DestroyFunc ShowString
  AddToFunc   ShowString
  + I Exec echo '$*' | osd_cat -A center -p middle -f '*lucida*-20-*' -s 5 -d 1

  DestroyFunc ExpandAndShowString
  AddToFunc   ExpandAndShowString
  + I PipeRead `echo ShowString '$*'`

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-Flash: *
  *FvwmEvent-Flash: Delay 1
  *FvwmEvent-Flash: Cmd ExpandAndShowString
  *FvwmEvent-Flash: new_desk $$$$[desk.name$$[desk.n]]
  *FvwmEvent-Flash: new_page "Page: $$[page.nx] $$[page.ny]"

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Flash

  #KillModule FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Flash

Preventing future questions. There is a problem in osd_cat, it may show a
text for less than one second. Also for better results try to disable
either "Delay 1" line or "new_page" line, since the order of the sent
events are not very good, we just need to have one new_page_or_desk event.

Mikhael.

In 2.5.6:

  Key N  A  SC  Current Next ($[w.class]) MyFocusAndRaise

In older versions (this syntax may be obsolete in the future):

  Key N  A  SC  Current Next ($c) MyFocusAndRaise

I am not on the latest Nvidia Driver, but the version doesn't matter ... it keeps
crashing. Do you file a bugreport, or should I do? The problem is that this
isn't as reproducable as it should be.

> MPlayer 0.90rc4-2.95.4
This is the latest release.

> Ok, its 2.5.6 !
Nice. Layers are fixed in this version.

> Once again : MPlayer 0.90rc4-2.95.4 and Fvwm 2.5.6

One time is enough. :-)

Okay you can check the layer while fullscreen if you simply press alt-tab or
whatever your WindowList is bound.

Mplayer tells you on stdout if he tries to change its default layer to window
10. This were the two lines I was refering to. But you have the latest Mplayer
version anyway.

> I hope that I send you enough informations.  It's really friendly from you
> to help me !  Many thx !
Yes, you did. - No problem. The problem is caused by us.


> Style "MPlayer" GnomeIgnoreHints
You have the line Style "MPlayer" GnomeIgnoreHints in you .fvwm2rc. This tells
.fvwm2rc to let Mplyer *not* change its layer ... so it stays on layer 4. Remove
that line restart and this should fix your problem.

Nope, I don't see any delays.  Could it be something on your
machine that degrades X server or module to fvwm communication?

Doesn't work well for me.  With this code, I have two problems :

- The window doesn't cover the 20 pixels on the bottom of my screen. (not
  critical but not pretty)
- The window keep the layer 10 and is on top over all the others window.

Use xwininfo -size [1] on the window. If this windows has x or y increments like
the xterm I provided in [1] it means that it can't go fullscreen at all.

You could move you pager in layer 4 so you full screen application could step
ontop of your pager.

But just wait. Maybe someone else has a better idea than I do have.

Note that 

  Mouse 2 R S Move

does work as expected.

Some functions that operate on a window are triggered by a button
release instead of a button press.  I have no idea why, but it
look like an intentional choice.  This makes a difference only for
the root window and very obscure uses, such as

  Mouse 1 1 n NoWindow iconify

This is like a drag-and-drop iconify action:  you press somewhere,
drag the pointer to the target window and 'drop' the action on it.
Weird.

I will change all ButtonRelease triggers to ButtonPress as in most
other commands and see how that works.  *If* BR triggering is
usefull at all, it should be some kind of generic modifier to all
commands requesting window selection.

>   Mouse 3 R S Next (Focused) Iconify                # broken

Fixed.

No, Thomas, this is not a problem. If you compare your function and mine
you will see the problem. You need UpdateStyles before Maximize otherwise
it maximizes a window as if border+title (20-30 pixels) are still here.

Well, you may use Layer 5 not 10, or most probably just Raise is enough.

Hi. I'm using fvwm 2.4.7 in an slackware linux box.

I hapen to be using the mouse on the left side of my desk. I would like to swap the mouse buttons (a la kde) for convinience; I've read the man pages but didn't find a command to do that. Any ideas? Thanks.

This might be a general X question, or even a Gimp question, and thus off-topic in here.  I'm not smart enough to figure out if it is.  But:  Is there any way to get two mice working at once?  I have a wheel mouse and a trackball.  I use the trackball for just about everything.  But when working in Gimp, it would be very nice to have the wheel, and the extra couple of buttons, available.  The extra axes I can ignore, but using the wheel (for example) as a pressure control for an airbrush tool...or for scrolling in documents...whatever.  Is there a way to manage it?

I am not sure if I understand you correctly.  To swap the left  and
right mouse buttons, type

  $ xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

For example, put this into your ~/.xinitrc of add it to the fvwm
start function:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I exec $ xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

To change back to the normal layout, issue

  $ xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"

The answer is an example in the xmodmap man page.

		      Please put only 80 chars on a line.

There is more then one way to do it. You can configure gpm [1] to handle to mice
and let him repeat it for X. Read the manpage for gpm. The other method is to
configure a second pointer device in X. It is also in the Documentation for X.

hi guys,

i have a problem with my menus.

as you can see in the screenshot (http://www.lazef.be/ec2003/transfer/menu.jpg) i have a white vertical border on the most leftside of my menus.
the width of this white part seems to be function of the total width of the menu

this is my menustyle-part of my .fvwm2rc:

# Colors
Colorset 0 Pixmap Green-Menu2.xpm, fg green
Colorset 1 fg seashell2, bg #808080
Colorset 2 fg black, bg #F0F0F0
Colorset 3 fg green, bg "dark green"

# Menu
MenuStyle * Win
MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%2.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3>%1|"
MenuStyle * MenuColorset 0
MenuSTyle * ActiveColorset 3
Menustyle * Font "xft:Arial:size=10:encodig=iso8859-15;"
MenuStyle * SideColor "dark green"

anybody has any ideas what i did wrong? or how to fix it?

thanx,
teufen

Load Green-Menu2.xpm into your text editor and remove the one pixel line
(one or more chars on every encoded line), don't forget to decrease the
pixmap width in the header. Or use a graphical editor to edit the image
if this is easier for you.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Dominik, nothing on my system has changed with the exception of
the fvwm version - but do please let me know what I can do to
convey forth the necessary info that you might require (debug
code, printfs, etc).

PS: please CC replies.

Sample config:

/usr/sbin/gpm -m /dev/ttyS0 -t ms -g1 -M -m /dev/psaux -t PS/2

The -m specifies the device name, the -t the mouse protocol (do
'/usr/sbin/gpm -t help' for a list of protocols), -g1 enables the link
between tapping the touchpad mouse and mouse button 1.  -M
chains two mice together.  This will create a device file
/dev/gpmdata.  When you have both working in console mode, edit
/etc/X11/XF86Config and make the following your pointer section.

Section "Pointer"
Protocol    "MouseSystems"
Device      "/dev/gpmdata"
EndSection

To make this enabled by default, I edited /etc/rc.d/init.d/gpm and
replaced the default command with the working gpm command.

I didn't get any replies when I had posted this email to fvwm-workers,
so I'm giving it another try (please help),

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0302/msg00125.html

Olivier, since you did quite a bit of the multibyte coding and
my question addresses a subsection of it (how to handle something),
could you please take a quick peek ?

PS: please CC replies.

Thanks & Regards,

No, it was not me, but Jon who is thinking about adding features.

That has nothing to do with vmware, just do it like on a
hardware-computer.

Hi,

I was wondering if you could help to override a webpage setting the =
window placement
to 0, 0 (ie., <script> move.window(0,0) ) as it hides the title bar and =
prevents you from controlling the window.

I have tried using NoPPosition and geometry but these don't work, though =
the twm window manager does handle it properly.

If you can give me any suggestion to resolving this problem it really =
would
be most .

Regards

Dermot Whelan

The best way is to turn off JavaScript in your browser.  Mozilla
can fine tune this to only forbid certain actions.  In case you
can not live without full JS functionality, try

  Style <browser-stylename> FixedPPosition, FixedUSPosition

(you need the latest 2.5.x unstable version for this).

I don't remember whether I ansered this already.  I have recently
committed some code to make it work.  You need current CVS code or
2.5.7 when it comes out.

Sorry, I do not have the slightest idea where to start looking.
If I could see it myself I would find a way.

FvwmTaskBar wants to get the full width, it does not want to be swallowed.

It can be swallowed. You may compare the man pages for the feature lists.
Theoretically FvwmIconMan would be better in the constructor approach,
with some work you can achieve what you want (including swallowing).
Practically it is not very easy, but possible.

Mikhael.

Hello.

I want to place the pager and the iconman side by side.
How can I specify their geometry to accomplish this?

I am thinking about something like

*FvwmIconMan: ManagerGeometry	6x1-0-0
*FvwmPager: Geometry x32+<the x position of FvwmIconMan minus the width o=
f FvwmPager>-0

For the archives.

The important part that changed is the default of '*FvwmIconMan:
resolution'. It used to be 'global' but is now 'page'.

Iconified windows with "NoIcon" defined does not stay on the
current page and as such does no show in the icon manager.

Setting '*FvwmIconMan: resolution' to 'global' or 'desk' make the
iconified windows show again.

Hi List!
Is it possible to use a SloppyFocus together with a RaiseOnClick. So I
want to use SloppyFocus, but when I click on a window it is raised?

I use:

Style * SloppyFocus
Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

works as expected with all fvwm-versions I tried.

At least with 2.4.x and later, in ancient versions,
MouseFocusClickRaises was an option of the GlobalOpts command
(which should not be used anymore).

Hi there,

I know my suggestion is not that convenient. I use a couple
of environment variables in my .fvwm2rc to achieve this.

For example:

SetEnv BorderWidth 3 
SetEnv IconManButtonWidth 100
PipeRead `printf "SetEnv IconManWidth $[BorderWidth] + $[BorderWidth] + $[IconManButtonWidth]"` 
...

Style BorderWidth $[BorderWidth], HandleWidth $[BorderWidth]
...

*FvwmIconMan: buttongeometry $[IconManButtonWidth]x20
## IconMan in bottom right corner
*FvwmIconMan: geometry 1x0-0-0
...

## Pager on the left hand side of IconMan
*FvwmPager: geometry 50x32-$[IconManWidth]-0
...


So if you change the size of IconMan or Border the position
of the pager will change as well.

Regards Uwe

You could create a hotkey to move the window when clicking it somewhere 
else but the title. Something like

Mouse 1 WTS 4 move

=> when clicking the left window key you can move the window by clicking 
it everywhere.

(I am writing the command as I remember it without checking if it is 
correct. But it should give you an idea.)

I'm haveing a problem when I run configure.  Every time I try to run the
./configure file, I get this error message:

checking argument types of select()... configure: error: can't determine
argument types


I don't know what to do now.  I don't have root access to my machine, but I
add the --prefix=PATH to my call of ./configure
What causes this problem and what can I do to fix it.

Please always state what fvwm version you are talking about.

Open the config.log file and look for any error messages near the
string select().  That should provide an indication of what went
wrong.  If that information does not help, or if you think it's a
bug in the configure script, send the relevant portions of the
config.log to the mailing list so we can take a look.

--prefix does not play a role here.

I've checked the config.log file and found that the problem is in the file
'vm_types.h'
the problem is in this section (of vm_types.h):

#ifdef __64BIT__
typedef signed long     rpn64_t;
#else /* ILP32 */
#ifdef _LONG_LONG
typedef signed long long   rpn64_t;
#else /* no long long */
#ifdef _ALL_SOURCE
typedef quad    rpn64_t;
#endif /* _ALL_SOURCE */
#endif /* _LONG_LONG */
#endif /* __64BIT__ */



the 'typedef quad rpn64_t' fails.
I'm not a system admin and I don't know what this file is all about.
I get he same error for verions: 2.4.14, and 2.4.0

This looks like AIX, but doesn't match up to my 5.1 header.
What OS, Release, and compiler are you using.

I'm able to run configure without problems on the 5.1 machine.

Please reply to the fvwm list.

So far, I tried AIX 4.3.3, 4.3.1, and 5.1.
It works for me on all of them.

My 4.3.3 system identifies itself like this:

monstro> uname -a
AIX monstro 3 4 001050744C00

(I know AIX shows the numbers backwards, but I don't know where to see
the last 3.)

The compiler is /bin/cc linked to /usr/vac/bin/xlc.
It looks like the compiler is Visual Age 5:

monstro> cc -V                 
/usr/bin/pg /usr/lib/nls/msg/en_US/vacpp.help 
  VisualAge C++ Professional / C for AIX Compiler, Version 5

Perhaps your patches aren't current, this problem seems
familiar...

Maybe if you post the code snippet its trying to compile
and the output you are getting.

You can usually find the admin by sending mail to root or
asking the person next to you.

You haven't posted the error message you get.

You might want to try to pull out the compile thats failing
from configure.log and trying it outside Fvwm.  Sometimes you have
to do a little surgery on what its trying to compile, like removing
the #include confdefs.h.  If you post the code fragment thats failing
with its messages, I'll try it on one of my machines.

ABOUT THIS RESPONSE

This response was generated as a result of your inquiry from the counters that Andale provides for eBay sellers on the www.ebay.com website. If you are currently managing your counters from the Ebay site, this is the correct FAQ for you !! If, however, you manage your counters from the Andale site (www.andale.com), please log into your account, access the help link (top right) and send an email into the Andale Counters Support Team. The counters on Andale have more functionality (such as the ability to create anywhere counters, view closed auctions, etc) and are managed differently, creating a very different response, which may be inaccurate if you utilize the www.andale.com website.

THE THANKS FOR LOOKING IS DISPLAYED IN MY AUCTION AND I DID NOT SELECT THE HIDDEN COUNTER?

The “Thanks for looking” will be the logo displayed when you select the hidden counter as your option, and will also be displayed during site maintenance, typically on Thursday evenings and into early Friday morning. The Thanks for Looking counter also displays as a fail safe for your auctions. When the internet is busy, or there is a lot of traffic, it sometimes takes more than a few seconds to display your counter. We have this set very low, so not to interfere with the loading of your auctions. If you just wait a few moments, and refresh, you should be able to bring up a fresh instance, with the correct counter. 


I RECEIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE "USER NOT F0UND" WHEN ATTEMPTING TO LOGIN TO MY MANAGE COUNTERS PAGE

If you are accessing your counters from Andale:
The reason that you can't see your counters is that we do not have your current eBay userID and password. Fortunately, we have an easy way for you to store your eBay information with us (and view your counters). You will need to enter your eBay username and password. To do this click on the My Andale tab followed by the SETTING link. The Market Id's and Passwords are on the right. Update this infromation and you should now be able to see your counters on the counters page (under the Counters tab).

If you are accessing your counters from Ebay (the manage counter page).
It is likely you have recently changed your email or ebay information and you will need to reregister.
To register, log into eBay and click on the Site Map link. Once you have done that, click on the phrase in the middle column that reads, "Manage/Edit my Andale.com counters". If you get automatically logged in, click on the Logout link and then click on the Login link to see the Registration part of the page.

WHERE CAN I VIEW MY HIDDEN COUNTERS?
WHERE CAN I VIEW MY COUNTERS ALL ON ONE PAGE?

To view your hidden counter details, sign in to your eBay account and click the link for My eBay Preferences Tab.  Click the Selling tab.  At the bottom of the Selling page, there is a section called "Selling-Related Links."  The first column in this section has the heading "Managing your auctions."  In this column, click the "Manage/Edit my Andale counters" link and sign in to your counters account using the email address you have on file for your eBay account.  You can bookmark this sign in page to easily return to it without having to follow all of these steps.  On this page you can manage your counters and view stats on Hidden Counters.  

YOU FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD OR RECEIVE THE MESSAGE "INVALID EMAIL ADDRESS"

Please click on the "forgot my password" link located underneath the password field.  Your password will be emailed to you.

YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS HAS CHANGED

Please follow the re-registration information given above.  Be sure to register with your eBay user email address.

CAN I CHANGE MY PASSWORD?

Unfortunately, you cannot change the password for your account.

I ALREADY HAVE A COUNTER ON MY AUCTION BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE MANAGE COUNTERS PAGE, WHY DOES IT SAY "ADD COUNTER"?

The "ADD COUNTER" will display on your Manage/Edit Andale Counter page until it is viewed. If you've selected a smart counter, it will not count you, so you would not be able to trigger the first view that will show as 00001. 

YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE STYLE OF A COUNTER

First, you can change the style of the counter using the "Revise" link located at the top of any auctions without bids.  The revision section for the counter is located in the Pictures & Details section.  You will need to select a different style counter when from the drop down menu and then continue through the eBay revision process. You will need to select a different style counter when from the drop down menu and then continue through the eBay revision process, and once you save your selection, you will want to finish the process by selection submit.

If you are registered and logged in to the Andale Manage Counters Page done through eBay, click the checkbox to the left of the auction number, change the style from the drop down menu and click Edit.  You will not be able to change multiple counters at one time from this page.

HOW DO COUNTERS COUNT VISITS?

A Smart Counter only adds another hit when a unique user visits your page (one hit per unique IP address). A Page Counter will count the visitors that come to your ad every time they come to your page (even if they visit your ad multiple times). 

HOW DO I VIEW MY HITS ON CLOSED AUCTIONS?
This function is available when you register for counters at www.andale.com, and is not currently available if you manage your counters from the Ebay site. Counters are also FREE on the www.andale.com site.

If none of these points addresses your issue, please respond to this email and we will be glad to help you with the issue that wasn't covered in this email.  You do not need to re-type your question, as we will have a record of your original email.

Thank you for your patience!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I've just installed v2.5.6 and I'm seeing some strange things with
MPlayer. Not sure whether this is actually FVWM's fault or MPlayer's,
but I wanted to see if anyone else is seeing a problem.

I have the following lines in my styles files:
Style MPlayer		StaysOnTop, StartsOnScreen 1
Style "*MPlayer - Video*"		NoTitle, StaysOnBottom

Prior to this version this had the desired effect of keeping the video
on the background layer with the controls on the top, but this doesn't
seem to work any more, they both move layers as if those lines were not
there.

Does anyone have any idea why this might be?

Cheers,

Andy

There was some bug in the prev. version that prevented the video from rising
to the top!

With 2.5.6 it works properly :-)

I could do that but it would make no sense, because the minimal config 
file is an empty config file (so only the fvwm default config is used) 
Do you still want me to post it? :)

I am not sure how to use the gdb. How are the exact steps to make gdb 
what you want? Is it started in the FvwmConsole or in a shell? Perhaps 
gdb did not offer an result because I did install fvwm using 
"checkinstall" and as I remember it strips all executables. I think that 
must not be, am I right?

But i did attach an "strace -p `pidof FvwmTaskBar`". Perhaps this does 
help, too?

And well, I m not sure if FvwmTaskBar really _crashes_. Fact is only 
that the process does not exist anymore after resizing and I see the 
taskbar disappearing. Perhaps it is exited correctly in some why, 
similar as an "-transient" pager?

I'll explain how to use gdb, but first, here is the stack trace.
(Not very useful.)

To use gdb with a core file, you need the full path the the executable and
the full path to the core file.  Normally, the core file is in your home
directory.  So:

home> which FvwmTaskBar
/home/dane/bin/fvwm/exec/fvwm/2.5.6/FvwmTaskBar
home> cd
home> gdb /home/dane/bin/fvwm/exec/fvwm/2.5.6/FvwmTaskBar core

then you type "where", then "quit".

Here is the X Error:

*FvwmTaskBar: Cause of next X Error.
   Error: 13 (BadGC (invalid GC parameter))
   Major opcode of failed request:  56 (ChangeGC)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
   Resource id of failed request:  0x4000023

Does the crash happen on your system with an empty config file, too?

I am running fvwm 2.5.6 and would like to have some dockapps available on my
screen.  When I added them to the .fvwm2rc or .xsession, they would stack one
over the other.  How can I have a small set of dock apps to view (vertically)
on the left side of the display.

Thank you in advance.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I was inspired recently to try to make my desktop a little more attractive.
To that end, I've been fiddling with button styles.

I have close bound to button 2 and maximize to button 4:

ButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp   (Pixmap close_activeup.xpm) \
              ActiveDown (Pixmap close_activedown.xpm) \
              Inactive   (Pixmap close_inactive.xpm)

ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp   (Pixmap maximize_activeup.xpm) \
              ActiveDown (Pixmap maximize_activedown.xpm) \
              Inactive   (Pixmap maximize_inactive.xpm) \
              ToggledActiveUp (Pixmap restore_activeup.xpm)

I expected the "restore" pixmap to be used on the maximized window and
the normal buttons on the "normal" window.

But what actually happens when I maximize a window is that I get the
same button 4 that I get in the normal window and button 2 becomes one
of the default square buttons, not my pixmap.

This is under 2.5.6 that I built yesterday.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm

Use the FvwmButtons module to swallow other applications.  Check
question 7.13 in the FAQ and the FvwmButtons man page.

Sorry, I can not confirm this.  The default resolution is 'page'
at least since 2.4.0 was released, and probably since 2.2.0 too
(I did not check this).  Something else must have changed in your
setup.

FYI:  When an X error causes a core dump, add

  XSynchronize(dpy, 1);

right after the initial XOpenDisplay() call.  The dump then occurs
right at the call that is responsible for the X error.

Fixed.  Code referenced "colorset" without checking for a valid
value --> &Colorset[-1] --> boom.

You nee to add

  ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax

Fvwm needs to know which window state it should watch on a
specific button.  The order in which commands are issued may be
important too.

You need to reconfigure "maximize" from button 2 (default) to 4:

  ButtonStyle 2 -
  ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax
  Style "*" MWMButtons

> and button 2 becomes one
> of the default square buttons, not my pixmap.

Toggled states.

Another way to solve your button 2 problem (the default square when
maximized) is to use AllActiveUp, AllActiveDown and AllInactive states
instead of the configuration above, or to explicitely add Toggled states.

Mikhael.

First, I am a happy camper. The change whatever made me find the
Resolution setting and it solved another annoyance. But if you
think this is a bug I will do my best to help you find it.

My diff[1] indicated that the Resolution default had changed. Now
I see that if was a manpage update and not an actual change.

For thease tests I have two windows. One xconsole that is
iconified and a xterm.

With 2.4.8 the Resolution setting makes no difference.
FvwmIconMan always shows. (X is a minicon).
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

With 2.4.14 I get this result.

Undefined Resolution.
[  xterm   ]

Resolution: Global
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Resolution: Desk
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Resolution: Page
[  xterm   ]

Resolution: Screen
[  xterm   ]

Full fvwm2rc.m4 is available at [2].

Hello everyone,

I went from gnome + sawfish to fvwm some time ago. I love the speed, 
versatility and the fact that I can set everything in just a few files 
(.Xinitrc, .xdefaults and .fvwm2rc).

There is one thing I miss though: files on the desktop. In gnome when 
you use gmc or nautilus there is a directory called ~/.gnome-desktop 
(or something like that). Everyting in it is displayed on the desktop, 
which is IMO very convenient. I used to put softlinks to program 
sources and other stuff I'm working there.

Is there a way to do this in fvwm without going back to the bloat & 
bugs of nautilus or gmc? I'm running 2.4.14 on a redhat 7.3 box.

TIA for any suggestions.

No, such features are not in the scope of a window manager.

Perhaps you could use the ROX-System (not everything from it, just some 
parts/modules) for this? I am not using it, but I have heared that it is 
very small, fast, nice and window manager independent! And it offers 
this functionality AFAIK.

Thanks Gert, I've set it up. Looks nice, allthough I will have to get 
used to the interface.

Thanks to everyone who replied. It now works the way I had in mind.

Also related to title bars, I've seen some FVWM themes that use
additional graphics in the titlebar to get different kinds of effects.
For example, with appropriate left- and right-side graphics (and maybe
others) it's clearly possible to make the window title appear in a
"colored bubble" with rounded edges in a titlebar of a different
color. The themes code is complex enough that I couldn't easily
determine how this was being accomplished, nor could I deduce it from
the fvwm2 man page. Can someone provide a simple example, please?

Only peripherally related, who or what decides how big "maximized" is?
Is that an application function, a window manager function, or
something else? Maximize on my machine seems to translate to "make a
little bigger and move the titlebar to the top of the screen". I'd be
just as happy if it translated to, "fill the whole screen".

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm

I tried this with 2.4.8, and it used "page" resolution by default.
Then I tried 2.4.0, and it did the same.  And latest CVS code too.

Hi folks

I have 2.5.6 compiled on a RedHat 7.3 box and an 8.0 box.
The 7.3 installation is fine. On 8.0 all text drawn by
fvwm (on titlebars, menus, buttons, etc) has an extra small box
(unknown character?) drawn before each character. This happens
regardless of font. Screenshot included.

fvwm throws out the following message for each font loaded:


[FVWM][FlocaleGetFontSet]: (lucidasanstypewriter-12) Missing font charsets:
ISO10646-1, JISX0208.1983-0, KSC5601.1987-0, GB2312.1980-0, JISX0201.1976-0


Is this related to bidi text support or unicode (I know nothing
about either subject)?

Cheers
Ric

This is not fvwm related but is a bug that shipped with redhat 8.0

In Red Hat 8.0 they changed the LANG from en_US to en_US.UTF-8". To make
it work right, edit...

/etc/sysconfig/i18n and change LANG="en_US.UTF-8" to LANG="en_US". 

Then log out from the shell and back in. man and other apps will display
correct characters.

There are a list of frequently asked questions about other Redhat 8.0
quirks answered at http://redhat.cltonline.com/fom-serve/cache/4.html

Hope this helps.

Hello,

Is it possible to have (or simulate) the following behaviour with
FvwmButtons: When the button of a panel is pressed, and there is no
application yet in the panel, this application is started. Otherwise,
just open and close the panel.

cheers,
Remko

Not at the moment.  Not spawning the panel upon startup can be
achieved with the UseOld option, but there is no way yet to tie an
action to a panel button in case the panel does not exist.

Ok, unless someone else is eager to do this, i'll write it in the near

You need to set the FPReleaseFocus style too:

  Style TLtodo FPGrabFocus, FPReleaseFocus

> 	+ "I" None ("TLtodo") Exec /home/tlau/bin/todo.py

> 	+ "I" Wait TLtodo

Ugh, that line isn't such a good idea.  Assuming the function was
called when there already was a TLtodo window on the desk.  The
"Wait" the waits forever for a new one to appear and fvwm remains
in the wait loop, working with reduced functionality.  You want

 + I None (TLtodo) Wait TLtodo

instead.

Hi

When I start my fvwm, the FvwmButtons does not list the last item listed in
the configuration.  When I do a "restart" then the buttons are displayed fine.
On startup, the last item "xeyes" is always outside the button bar.

My FvwmButtons configuration is listed below.

PS - One other question is where are the FVWM debug message logged to? I do not
see any in $HOME.

Nope, your config does not help either.  There is nothing
indicating such a change in the diffs, and regardless whether I
use 2.4.0, 2.4.8, 2.4.16 or cvs, the default is and was always
page resolution.  The problem must come from your specific system.
Thins to check:

 - Is the right config file executed?
 - Is the right fvwm executable used?
 - Are the modules the ones that were compiled with the fvwm core?

I don't see why your xeyes refuses to be swallowed st first, but
there are syntax errors in your config file (see below)

All the messages are sent to the X console.

  ^^^^

You are trying to place all the buttons in the same slot, and the
slot is not even within the button bar.  You want to place the
buttons at

  1x1+0+0
  1x1+0+1
  1x1+0+2
  ...

But then, there seems to be a bug in the parsing of the Size
option and the geometry part is not understood by FvwbButtons, so
it does not hurt.  I will fix this bug, but then you have to fix
the errors in your config file too.  And you should separate
options with commas.

We must have a language barrier here. :-)

The default has not changed, I missread the diff and only the
manpage has changed.

The problem I have identified is that Iconified windows does not
show up in some FvwmIconMan: Resolution. This might be a bug, it
might NOT.

This is the results I see.

In 2.4.8 it does not mather which resolution I set. FvwmIconMan
always shows both windows. (xterm is normal, xconsole is
iconified).
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

In 2.4.14 setting resoltution to Global or Desk I get this
result (both windows show).
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

But setting resolution to Page or Screen gives this result (the
xconsole is no longer shown).
[  xterm   ]

Removing the "Style '*' NoIcon" makes the xconsole show in Page
and Screen too.

Ah, finally I understand your problem.  I think the position of
the 'icon' had random values without an icon on the desktop.
Should be fixed now.  Please check whether this happened with
2.5.6 too and whether it's gone in the latest CVS code.

hi!

i've a problem and i don't know exactly what it is ;) 

after some minutes menus from gtk2 apps are not accessable until i
restart fvwm.
and if i lock the screen in this time (with xscreensaver-command -lock)
i'm unable to enter my password. the screensaver just displays the
message, that it could not grap the keyboard because it's already
grapped.

any idea?

Hello,

as configuring fvwm I ask myself which way the desktops and pages are 
set up best:

1) One desktop with multiple pages
2) Multiple desktops with only one page each
3) Multiple desktops with multiple pages each


How are *you* using these and why?
Where are the advantages or disadvantages of these possibilities?

Thanks,

Gert

I use 2)
I would say the advantage of 1) is that you can have windows that are
bigger than the physical screen-resolution.
3) might be confusing (mixing of concepts) for novice users.

I'm thinking about whether to switch to 1).
I think I will write a system to set this on the fly (maybe with a simple
GUI...)

I'm running w/ 2 desktops w/ 4 pages each.
The pager is set to see only one desk.
Pager root color differs between the 2 desks to differentiate which i'm looking at.
Taskbar is set to show only that page's tasks.
WindowList can see all.

Running iconless (besides mini's).

Middle clicking on pager switches between the two desks.
PointerWindow (FvwmPager) GotoDesk 1 0 1

I could have it also switch pages if i process mouse location, but i
havent impl'd that.

One desktop with 2x2 pages (home) and 3x2 pages (work).  I don't
like desktops.  They are less flexible and consume more space in
the pager.  Top left page: shells and emacs; programming.  Top
right page occupied by my email client.  Bottom left page used by
browser windows.  All other pages are spares.

I don't need more pages because I like to close windows that I do
not need at the moment.  I can start applications quickly with
keyboard shortcuts from the root menu (e.g. mozilla:
alt-space z), so there is little point in keeping windows open all
the time.  I rarely use icons.

For testing purposes I have a four desk pager as an FvwmButtons
panel and two buttons for 'next' and 'prev' desk beside my normal
pager.

I use (1).  Instead of multiple desktops, i would rather prefer
multiple pages.  It is much easier to move windows around,
especially when a window is partially out of sight (on the
another page).

I suppose, if the key bindings are configured right using (1) would
be quite same as (2).  But (3) would be complicated/hard-to-use as
i would run out of key bindings easily.  I am already almost out of
modifier key combinations which can be easily pressed by a single
hand.

Other problem(s) Dominick had addressed elsewhere.

> One desktop with 2x2 pages (home) and 3x2 pages (work).

    Pretty much what I've got too - 3x2 pages. But I've started
getting used to not having the pager anymore. I get to know which
page I'm on depending on the context:

      +---------------+---------------+
      | mail/personal | mozilla       |
      +---------------+---------------+
      | work          | freeciv ;)?   |
      +---------------+---------------+
      | free          | free          |
      +---------------+---------------+

    Don't have much window clutter because I use gnu-screen (and most
of my windows are (x|E)terms). Its typically 1 window in each page.
For those pages where I happen to have more than one window I use
FvwmTabs (thanks Scott :)).

    And yes ... I rarely need to iconize. Most people here use windoze
and have no clue as to what I'm using (other than the fact that I'm
using Linux). So if at all I have to hide a window I just switch
desktops (if its not on an xterm). If its on an xterm, I just switch
to another screen ;))  Those who happen to run linux ask, "Hey, how
come my screen doesn't look like that on RedHat?" heh!

    Hmm, ... must be my longest post to the fvwm list ;).

That's cuz theyre not using Litestep.

My windoze has no icons, has a small taskbar, tray (autohidden), launcher
(stiletto autohidden) and vwm all in the titlebar space up top. The
rest of the desk is blank. The rootmenu is my own.

LS is rc text file driven, module based, and has documentation noone reads.

    Lemme put it this way .... if they were smart/interested enough to
use (and configure) Litestep, they might as well be using Linux since
there's no compulsion as such to use windoze - our work is not on
windoze!! Those who are capable enough to use it are using Linux ;).
People here use windoze just because of a)outlook and b)m$ office!
And, of course, because they don't know/want to know how and what to
type ;)!

    But I digress.

  I would like to get rid of the vertical borders on XTerm window's and 
I have figured out how to do this on a per application basis, however, I 
can't find out how to have horisontal borders ( top bottom ) and get rid 
of the vertical ( left right ).

  Any ideas or pointers ?

Are you perhaps using key release bindings?  (Key -F1 ...)  It
looks like fvwm has reserved the keyboard for exclusive use and
never releases it.  The one prominent cause for this I am aware of
are key release bindings.  They simply do not work as advertised

  Thanks,

   How about if I got rid of the border and tried to have vertical 
handles on the title bar ? ( on the sides ? ).

   Do you think this would be possible ?

We have already thought about disabling some parts of the borders,
but right now you can only have a full border or none.  We are
busy with stabilising the 2.5.x branch right now, so we will not
be able to start implementing new features before fall (at least).

Because of these problems, I have already removed key release
bindings in the CVS version (2.5.7).  There is no way to get them
working with a full redesign of the window manager.

Hello everybody,

A small question about CursorStyle. When I'm over an XTerm window, my 
cursor is a very narrow default shape like a capital "I" which I 
"loose" a lot. I would like to change that but I have no idea which 
context this is.

TIA for any help!

This is not an Fvwm question.

Hello,

Is it possible to bind a key to open a panel in FvwmButtons ? If not,
would this be a lot of work ?

cheers,
Remko

At the moment, FvwmButtons handles only pressing the <return> key
over a button, not shortcuts.  If you know the position of a
button, you could use the WarpPointer command to place the pointer
on the button and then press <return>.

Can you send a return event with an FVWM command ?

  When I first started using FVWM, I only had 1 desktop and 4 or 9
pages.  When I moved to having 9 pages, I would almost always put my web
browser in the center page, my mail term window (160x60 characters)
would go in the top center square and then other things would go on
other pages.  Usually I would fit 4 aterms in a page in a quad fashion.

  When I moved from fvwm to sawmill a few years ago, I kept the same
desktop configuration, then one day I experimented with having multiple
desktops.  I then had two desktops of 3x3 pages.  I kept my work stuff
on the first desktop and my home stuff on the second desktop.  Around
the time and tabbed browsing (in galeon) became popular, I used
sawfish's feature to keep a window sticky between desktops, but not
pages.  So that way I could have the same browser window in the center
square of both desktops.   After moving to RedHat 8.0 and becoming
frustrated with the modified sawfish and metacity, I moved back to fvwm
and discovered a way to make galeon moved between desktops.  It's still
not the same as the way sawfish did it, but I'm satisfied for now.

No, that does not work reliably.  I tried it once, but it is so
flaky that I removed the code.  Many applications don't accept
keyboard input when not focused.

While we are talking about simulating key presses:  When the
pointer is already over the button you can as well simulate a
button press.  It does not work perfectly either, but much
better than simulating key presses.  Try

  Next (FvwmButtons) WarpToWindow <x> <y>
  FakeClick depth <d> press 1 release 1

<x>, <y> = coordinates of button inside the window
<d> = the 'depth' of the window that should receive the events,
      try 3 first and if that does not work, try higher values.
      1 would be the root window and 2 the frame window.

The unstable versions 2.5.5 and above have the styles
StickAcrossDesks and StickAcrossPages, so no more hack is needed
to get windows sticky only on a single desk or page.

I have been using one desk with 2x2 pages for years although fvwm-themes
always offered 4 desks as an option.

But then I got a persistent internet connection and a pretty big uptime
of my home machine, so I often have about 40 open windows at once.
There is a strong need for more pages. Now I want to actually have several
pages for one subject (like my work).

For several months now I use 4 desks, with 2x2 pages each, very handy.
Desk labels in the pager are helpful. A persistent 4-desk pager is not
so space consuming for a 1280x1024 screen.

  http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/screenshots/full/migo.png

Having a lot of windows (mainly terminals) is not trivial to handle.
WindowList SortByResource (this usually also sorts by a mini icon) may
help to find a window quickly. In case you can't spot it in the pager.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I use (2) myself. I never have a use for a "desktop" that's a different size
to my screen. So I just deal in desks because it's easy.

I have 12 notional desks accessed by Alt-Fn keys, of which I have
standard uses for about 5. And I have a table of "named" desks for
arbitrary tasks, made on the fly at need< access via a menu (Alt-D).

I have key bindings to push a window to another desk: Shift-Fn for the
12 numbers desks and a menu matching the Alt-D one, attached to Alt-P,
to push to the named desks.

Cheers,

I use a single 3x3 desktop at the moment, although I'm meaning to
configure more desktops in a useful fashion and at that point I'd
probably drop to 3x2.  I have a short attention span, and as a result I
often have many things strewn about my desktop that I switch between
frequently: xlsclients lists 70 programs right now, some of which have
multiple windows (but most of them are xterms.)

In cases where I'm reading a lot of text at once (www browsing, email,
nntp, openoffice), I like to devote an entire page to an application at
full screen size.  I also usually devote an entire page for the gimp,
since it's easiest to keep its windows separate from all the others in
my alt-tab windowlist.

I'm eventually intending to use multiple desktops to help organize what
I'm doing in relation to my trains of thought, e.g. graphic editing on
one desktop, programming on another, and games on another.  The only
reason I haven't is because I whipped up a quick configuration about 6
months ago when I switched back to fvwm, and it's been Good Enough that
I haven't taken the time to finish the details.

Wow, the font and menu looks beautiful. What font are you using? Looks
like it is anti aliased too.

I have just discovered and removed a debug statement in the
FvwmWinList code that might have caused the problem by slowing the
module down in general.  It's probably not what causes the delay
you see - and it doesn't explain the FvwmPager problem either.

Hello everyone,

My .fvwm2rc has these statements:

	key right a mc scroll 100000 0
	key right a mc scroll -100000 0

so I can shift easily to another desktop (I use 4). There is a problem 
though, when I go to another desktop, the window that originally had 
focus (usually on the previous desktop) still has focus. As a result I 
start typing Mozilla keystrokes into Vim :-)

Is there a way to let fvwm give focus to a (most recently accessed or 
the one on top) window on the current desktop?

TIA!

You can get the same look if you use the tips on the screenshot itself
(you need a cvs version of fvwm-themes, not 0.6.2). Briefly a menu is:

  Colorset 5 fg rgb:f8/f8/f3, bg average, CGradient 50 rgb:50/50/78 rgb:40/40/5a
  Colorset 6 fg rgb:f8/f8/f3, bg rgb:40/5a/40
  MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, ActiveColorset 6
  MenuStyle * Font "Shadow=0:xft:Verdana:Medium:pixelsize=13:minspace=True"

You may set a non zero shadow, but it looks nice without a shadow too.
As for the rest of fonts used I suggest to take a look at fvwm-themes.
Of course these xft fonts only work in fvwm-2.5.x.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The best way to do this is probably with Peter McAlpine's FvwmTrackFocus
module.  I just threw the version I have at
http://themuffin.net/FvwmTrackFocus.pl, although he's probably lurking
and may have a more recent version.  Essentially, all you need to do it
start it with the rest of your modules, and it'll take care of focusing
the proper window.

I just downloaded snap-20030314 and its much improved -- thanks.

One thing to note though which recently changed.  I have the following
in my .fvwm2rc (why is there still a 2 in that filename still ?),

  Mouse 0         2       A       Resize

but what happens now, the resize only happens once I release the press
(unclick, whatever you want to call it); previously, as soon as I click
on that button on the title bar, the resize would take affect and I see
my rubberbands until such time as I release the press for it to take
affect.

Regards,

 - Nadim

Yes, I know this.  There is a choice to be made:

 1) Fix binding funtions without a context and break configs like
    the one above.  You can still have the old behaviour with

      AddToFunc my_resize
      + I resize
      mouse 0 2 a my_resize

 2) Keep the old functionality unchanged and leave the following
    kind of binding broken:

      mouse 1 r n resize

Number too is clearly the better choice when talking about a clean
design (all commands work the same), but it breaks some old
configurations.

I do not have the problem in 2.5.6, I have not tried current/CVS.

However there seems to be another problem. This is not analyzed
and I have moved back to 2.4.14.

When setting 'Resolution Page' or 'Resolution Screen' the
FvwmIconMan was not updated until switch number to.

Same setup as before one xterm and one iconified xconsole.

[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to virtual desktop number X.

[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to virtual desktop number Y.

[X xconsole]

Switch back to starting position.

[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

According to _ME_ the correct sequence should be.

[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to virtual desktop number X.

[X xconsole]

Switch to virtual desktop number Y.

[X xconsole]

Switch back to starting position.

[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

That is probably the same problem.  I am going to release 2.4.16
soon.  Please verify if both problems are gone then.  Or if you
want to be really helpful, check out the 2.4 branch from CVS.

The problem with FvwmIconMan not beeing updated was in 2.5.6 (if
I was unclear on that).

I did a CVS checkout (with -r branch_2_4). I had no acheaders so
I guessed and used autoheaders.

The fvwm I got presents itself as 2.4.16.

Setting Resolution to Page and Screen still hides the Iconified
windows.

Nothing special.  If the shell script is in your path, and
named "myshell":

Exec myshell

Reply to the list, not the one answering.  (Sorry I haven't figured out
how to set the reply-to header correctly.)

Either of the first 2 forms should be fine.

I assume you tried it from the command line and it worked?

When you say it fails, does that mean nothing appears or are you
seeing a message?

Depending on how you started fvwm, error messages might be going to
different places.  Most likely, any error messages are in
$HOME/.xsession-errors.

That does not matter.  The bug I fixed was in 2.4.x and 2.5.x.

The build instructions are in docs/DEVELOPERS:

  $ aclocal && autoheader && automake -a && autoreconf
  $ ./configure
  $ make

That's the name of the next version that will be released.  In the
2.5.x branch the code from cvs is marked as such, but not in
2.4.x.

AddtoMenu RootMenu

My shell script is the AppRun batch file for ROX Filer.  It's huge.  
The first four lines are:


#!/bin/sh

PROG=ROX-Filer

APP_DIR=`dirname $0`
APP_DIR=`cd "$APP_DIR";pwd`; export APP_DIR


Funny thing is, my Quake2 plays happily as a shell script.

Well, I tried it as:

xterm -e start-rox

and it failed.  Then I tried it as:

xterm -e pauseme start-rox

to see if it was throwing out any error messages...and it worked
perfectly...until I closed the XTerm.  Then it vanished.  So it doesn't
seem to out-live the launching XTerm.  Though starting it in an XTerm,
and allowing it to finish starting, then closing the XTerm, doesn't seem
to kill it.  Perhaps the problem's with -e?  But I can't think of a way
to launch it without it.

Well, i don't know (or care) what rox filer does.  If rox filer is
a bona fide GUI, say like xv, gv, etc. or works (or can work) in the
background, like splay or pslatex, then, of course, there is no need
for an xterm.  In that case, your script should just work.

If it runs in xterm, then you need something to keep that xterm
alive so that it doesn't die, as you have already found out.  And,
this particular issue was resolved in one of comp.unix.* groups.
Let's see... oh yes in comp.unix.shell ...

I first did this with Resolution: Desk, changing to Resoltion:
Page made no difference.

When I login the xconsole gets iconified by auto.
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0

I then iconified and brought back the xterm
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0

I then turned on the virtual screen switched to page 2
and created a new xterm and also iconified that one.

FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0
FIM: icon geometry: 0 0 0x0

I have a script called opendir that looks like this:

-------------------------------

#!/bin/sh

# this script opens a directory in a file manager

# check if user has set $FILEMAN

if [ -n "$FILEMAN" ]; then
    `$FILEMAN` $* >/dev/null 2>&1
elif which rox > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    rox $* >/dev/null 2>&1
elif [ `which gmc` ]; then
    gmc $* >/dev/null 2>&1
# last resort, use good ol' xfm... :-)
else
    xfm $* >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

--------------------------------

Then I use it like this in .fvwm2rc:

AddToMenu RootMenu      "Root Menu"     Title
+                       "New Window"    Exec exec terminal
+                       "Home Directory"        Exec $HOME/.fvwm/opendir ~

This has always worked.

Maybe it's because of the " >/dev/null 2>&1 " ?

It is a GUI created with GTK+Python, and when launched manually from an XTerm, it completes and leaves the GUI running.  The XTerm can then be manually closed.  But if launched from an XTerm using -e, it closes as soon as the XTerm closes.

I am afraid to say that this approach also fails.  And yet it seems that you can run ROX-Filer just fine.

That sounds like it tries to maintain some kind of connection to
the invoking terminal.

Try using nohup.

Did a cvs up and recompiled.

This is what I get now.

Resolution: Global or Desk. (xterm normal, xconsole iconified).
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to next page still give.
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Resolution: Page.
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to next page.
[X xconsole]

And removing the StickyIcon Style gives
[  xterm   ]
[X xconsole]

Switch to next page.
[FvwmIconMan] (Becomes empty)

So I would say it is 100% correct.

Thank you.

(NOTE: I am not subscribed to the list so please respond to my email addy)

I have RedHat 8 and I installed fvwm.  I then used switchdesk to change to 
fvwm and x won't start for that user.. How do I get fvwm to start for that 
user account.  Since I know RH is a finicky beastie at times.. I'll let 
root keep using gnome.

Any help is appreciated.. thanks.

	Today, out of the blue, I decided that I wanted to apply
styles to specific windows (and not to window names, classes, or
resources, any of which may the same for multiple windows) on my FVWM
desktop.  I noticed that a request to do this was already pending in
the FVWM bug site(id #568), but seeing that it's been over 2 years
since the enhancement request was queued in the bug tracking system, I
decided to look into it for fun.

	I made the following changes to "fvwm/style.c" in fvwm-2.5.6:

*** style.c.orig        2003-03-16 15:48:15.000000000 -0800

+       sprintf(winId, "0x%x", (unsigned int)FW_W(fw));
+ 
        /* look thru all styles in order defined. */
        for (nptr = all_styles; nptr != NULL; nptr = SGET_NEXT_STYLE(*nptr))
        {
***************

        for (t = Scr.FvwmRoot.next; t != NULL && t != &Scr.FvwmRoot;

        {
+               /* Get the window ID: */
+               char winId[20];

                {
                        SET_STYLE_DELETED(t, 1);
                        Scr.flags.do_need_window_update = 1;

	This implements per-window styles, except for the the
possibility of the reuse of window IDs.  I apologize for the hokey
20-character fixed buffers; consider this a proof-of-concept
implementation, not rugged code.

	Here's a sample menu that applies per-window styles:

AddToMenu "WindowOps" "WindowOps" Title
+              "Focus Policy"        Popup FocusPolicyOps

AddToMenu "FocusPolicyOps" "Focus Policy" Title
+              "Click to Focus"      Current Style $[w.id] ClickToFocus
+              "Focus Follows Mouse" Current Style $[w.id] FocusFollowsMouse
+              "Never Focus"         Current Style $[w.id] NeverFocus
+              "Sloppy Focus"        Current Style $[w.id] SloppyFocus

Ok, sorry for not responding the long time. I had problems too to
reproduce this.=20

I played a little bit with my fvwmrc... I think what me confused was
that Buttons without default actions (when you click on them) doesn't
appear, even if you set the `Style "*" Button <n>`.=20

This time its reproducable and you can see the differences here

I updated my CVS tree a couple of days ago, and since then, whenever I
call Move from a mouse binding, the command doesn't happen until after I
release the mouse button.

The binding in question is:
Mouse   1   W   3   Move

The old behavior was to start moving on click, and stop moving when the
mouse was released.  I know there was some mumbling about commands
related to mouse presses, but the messages I could find weren't quite
related--forgive me if I missed something.

Thanks,

It's long bugged me that my AspectPixmap menu backdrops don't always fit
the menu; indeed, they rarely fit perfectly. Now, I know the image itself
cannot always fit, but I expected tiling after the scaling. Instead I
see patches from previous menu backdrops (I switch menu backdrop images
every so often).

So I went to the source and found in libs/Colorset.c, line 600 or so:

	/* Draws a colorset background into the specified rectangle in the target
	 * drawable. */                 
	void SetClippedRectangleBackground(

I'm a bit puzzled. Now I understand why it looks as it does, and I admit
I've not yet read the code and the calling code properly, but can someone
who understands the colorset code tell me why a menu background is simply
drawn once onto the area instead of being set as the XWindow's background
pixmap, which would then be tiled nicely but the X server?

Such an arrangement would let one use AspectPixmap to get the image
roughly right and then have the X server hide the edges with more
backdrop.

Failing this, shouldn't FVWM be blacking out (or something - maybe
the background-colour value if present in the Style) the whole menu
backdrop first?

Cheers,

I'm a bit confused.  Do you still think there is a bug?  Buttons
without an action bound to them are never show, yes.  I'm not sure
if it's documented in the man page, but it is how it was designed.

I see, this change is not going to make me happy.

BEGIN THEORY

For some reason, a more or less random number of commands worked
on button press while other commands worked on button release.
The first type did not work when invoked outside a window context,
for example on the root window:

  mouse 3 a sc move

just flashed the selection cursor, selected the root window and
beeped.  The right way to have move-on-press is

  AddToFunc move_on_press
  + I Move
  mouse 1 W 3 function move_on_press

In the future, I would like to remove the difference between both
types of commands.

END THEORY

So much for the theory.  Unfortunately, many people rely on the
old, broken behaviour.  It should be relatively easy to write a
script that changes your config, though.

Aha!  I knew I remembered seeing something about it.  I've updated my rc
to use a function instead, and it works fine now.  Thanks!

I might take a stab at a conversion script tomorrow, if I have time.=20
I'll have to figure out which functions had a behavioral change,
though.  If I can figure those out, the behavior only changed for mouse
bindings, correct?

Thanks again,

Look in your .fvwm2rc file for a line

  Style FvwmPager StaysOnTop

or

  Style FvwmPager Layer ...

and remove it.  If you can't find it, adding

  Style FvwmPager StaysPut

at the end of the file should help too.

I just needed about an hour to find the problem. If you play around
with your config it might happen that you have a button without action
defined. But IMHO describing this "feature" in the man page is enough
(maybe it's already somewhere but not in the 'Style' section).

I've attached a simple awk script (it SHOULD be POSIX awk compliant) to
do the conversion.  The only downside is that it eats whitespace on
converted lines.

Hello,

I am using fvwm2 version 2.4.3. I am using Xnest to get the desktop of Other 
Linux PC's Graphics screen to my PC Desktop just like an application. I have 
using the Ctrl+Alt+UP and Ctrl+Alt+Down arrow key to select the Window using 
the WindowList. I have added the below entries in the file 
/usr/local/share/fv.wm/ConfigFvwmDefaults

Key Up A MC WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
Key Down A MC WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

If I have used this keys to switch to other window and come back, then my 
keyboard is not working.

I found that the Alt key is release event is not registered for that window. 
So After come back to the Xnest session, I have to press the Alt key and 
release. Then only I am able to work.

My xmodmap entries in my Dekstop are

xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_L (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3        Mode_switch (0x71)
mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
mod5

Whare could be the problem. How can I come out from this problem? Can any 
body help me on this.

With Thanks and Regards,
L. Subbiah

File a bug report with Xnest.  XNest forgets to check the keyboard
state when it receives the keyboard focus.  It gets the modifier
key press, but it can not receive the key release.  This annoys me
too, but I can't do anything about it.

this has existed for as long as i have been using fvwm


situation: pointer determines window focus is on ( window that pointer
touches rises to top), there are 2 windows that overlap on the screen.

problem: if the pointer sits in the area of overlap, neither window achieves
focus...instead each window keeps alternating to the top.

moving the pointer to a non overlapping region of either window brings it
to the top and is stable, however it seems to me that whatever handles this
should know which window is in focus and should not attempt to raise the
window below it once the first window is raised.

not major, but annoying... i don't know what happens if 3 windows overlap.

this becomes a real headache during,for example, web browsing,  when message
or input boxes appear...and refuse to stay on top.

	Weird...in over 8 years of using FVWM I've never seen this. What
timeout value do you use for FvwmAuto?

	I was able to duplicate this, but it wasn't easy, and I can't make it
happen on every try (but that could be due to my own clumsiness). I had
to set a *very* low timeout value for FvwmAuto (10 ms), place the mouse
cursor over the top window, then move it very quickly from the top
overlapping window into a non-overlapped area of the lower window, then
back again into the top window in the overlapped area. In other words,
the cursor stayed over the lower window just long enough to satisfy the
FvwmAuto timeout, but moved back to the other window before the lower
one could be raised. Once the focus - raise - focus sequence lags
behind, it becomes a never-ending sequence till you move the pointer out
of the overlapped area. But without this little trick to start the
process, nothing out of the ordinary happens with overlapping windows.

	But FvwmAuto *does* know which window has focus, from its point of
view. Unfortunately it has no way to know that there's a pending raise
that hasn't happened yet, so it requests a raise for the window that
just satisfied the timeout. I don't think there's much that can be done
about that.

	I would suggest trying a higher value for the FvwmAuto timeout and see
whether this improves the situation.

	Is this primarily when this happens? And do you get a couple of
overlapping message/input boxes popping up at the same time, possibly
under the pointer so that this gets triggered automagically without your
having to do anything to start it? As I said, I had to work at it to
make it happen.


Cheers,
Bob

Actually, it's an old hat.  If the connection between fvwm and the
X server is much slower than between fvwm and FvwmAuto, it becomes
very likely to happen.  I have committed two patches:

 1) FvwmAuto 0 is not valid anymore.  The minimum value is 1.
    This should reduce the probability of a race condition a bit.
 2) FvwmAuto sends an "XSync" to fvwm after each action.  This
    should effectively remove the race with the default FvwmAuto
    config.

Can anyone point me on how to do key bindings with dolaris 5.8..I want
alt-tab behavior, switch desk behavior and some key combo that will let me
open a session to one of the 300 hosts I need access to.

I hope this isn't too lazy of a question

thanks

You may exchange "CurrentPage" with "CurrentDesk", and
remove "!Iconic". I you don't want to circle through the
windows you may want to use "windowlist" to get all windows
displayed.

Do you want to have 300 different key bindings?

Otherwise open a xterm and start ssh by hand:

Key x A SM Exec xterm

or 

Key x A S4 Exec xterm

Hi,

I want to add a tab browsing emulation to the browser dillo.  New and
empty windows (<Ctrl-N>) should be raised, new and non empty windows
(<Button-2>) should be lowered. Both window can be distinguished by
the window title. After a lecture in the manpage [1] I tried this, but it
doesn't work:

Style Dillo:*  StartsLowered     
Style "Dillo: Version 0.7.1" StartsRaised

What is wrong here? My fvwm2 version is 2.4.15.

Thanks in advance,

Christoph



[1]
from the fvwm2 manpage:

> Style stylename options 
> [...]
>              stylename  can  be  a  window's  name,  class,   or
>              resource  string.  It may contain the wildcards '*'

>              name  manner.   They  are  searched  in the reverse

>              wins.

Hi all,
This is probably a very simple question. But, when I iconify an applicatio=
n, such as Emacs, or Netscape, I get a =22nice=22 icon that maps to my app=
lication.
How do I configure this ?
Regards
Axelle.

Thanks I'll try.
I didn't realize how silly it sounds to ask for 300 different key bindings
ahem. But I have a group of homogenous hosts with serialized names i.e:
machine876 - machine888 etc. I was looking for some goofy cool
way to hit a certain key then enter serial number of the host..
Currently I use menu options which launch and xterm -e (expect script) to host.

by the way :: where is @gmx.net anyhow germany?

thanks again

You could use FvwmForm to achieve this. 
Create a form which lets you insert the number of the
host you want to contact and start a function by pressing
enter or a button hit.

I think it is a german provider. One can choose between
severel extensions. (.de, .net, ...)

Incidentally, I'd like a way to do something similar...  I don't think
fvwm currently offers a way to do this, and I think fvwm 2.5 is in a
feature freeze right now.  Perhaps 2.7 could offer a way to wait for a
keypress in a complex function and then offer the pressed key key via a
$variable.  This should make it possible to have a function gather, say,
2 keys after it's invoked by a keybinding, glue them together, and do
something useful with them.

As for the present, it's probably possible to build something like this
using perl and FVWM::Module.  It'd probably be pretty simple, but I
haven't made it as far as trying yet.

Hi,

I want to add a tab browsing emulation to the browser dillo.  New and
empty windows (<Ctrl-N>) should be raised, new and non empty windows
(<Button-2>) should be lowered. Both window can be distinguished by
the window title. After a lecture in the manpage [1] I tried this, but it
doesn't work:

Style Dillo:*  StartsLowered     
Style "Dillo: Version 0.7.1" StartsRaised

What is wrong here? My fvwm2 version is 2.4.15. And

WindowList ("Dillo: Version 0.7.1")

matches the desired window list.


Thanks in advance,

Christoph

Hi,

	I just upgraded my fvwm to 2.5.6 (from 2.5.4) and now  the windows are not 
receiving any mouse clicks!  Hm... I mean, the applications, not the windows, 
because the close/minimiz/maximize buttons works, but the applications 
buttons dont! they even got the focus, but not the clicks!
	Since without any config files all works ok, I think there's something wrong 
with my .fvwm2rc. Since it was working, I can only think that something has 
changed in configuration syntax. May someone help me?

Can you strip down the config file to the minimum showing this
behaviour and post it to fvwm-workers, please?

	I just found the offending part. it's the stroke configuration! If I strip 
the stroke lines from the config I got the normal behavior... is stroke 
broken or perhaps maybe my stroke libs? (Debian SID).

It might me possible, that the application is renaiming it's window
title during startup. So that this doesn't work.

We can't know if you don't post your problematic lines (read: we still
can't reproduce your problem).

Actually, it is easy to write a malfunction config that disables
any mouse clicks in the client windows:

  Mouse 1 W N StrokeFunc

Either don't use "W" here or use some non-N modifier, like CM (Ctrl-Alt).

Mikhael.

any line that denfines a stroke trigger the problem, like this:

Stroke N9632147     0 A A  Exec exec xterm
Stroke N1475369     0 A A  Exec exec netscape

There's a possibility of my libstroke is broken... but since I only use it on 
fvwm and dont even know how to test it!

This configuration (together with "Mouse 1 A A StrokeFunc") does exactly
what you explain, I would not say anything is broken.

The correct config for what you want is:

  Stroke N9632147 0 R A  Exec exec xterm  # draw in root
  Stroke N9632147 0 W M  Exec exec xterm  # draw in window with Alt pressed
  Stroke N1475369 0 R A  Exec exec netscape
  Stroke N1475369 0 W M  Exec exec netscape

  Mouse 3 R A StrokeFunc  # use mouse 3 for stroke in root
  Mouse 3 W M StrokeFunc  # use mouse 3 for stroke in window

Mikhael.

Hi,

The man page says :
    "Focus policy can be specified for individual windows."

Does this mean I can set the focus policy for a specific window (Ie. having
unique Window ID) dynamically ?
Is so then could someone tell me how please ?

At first I thought I could use the Style command but it only applies to groups
of windows according to name, class, or resource string (according to the
manual) 

Thanks in advance.

No, this is not possible currently.
The man page means "for individual windows matching a pattern".

Usually you do want to define the same focus policy (or other style
attributes) for windows with the same name/class. If this is your case
you may dynamically do:

  Pick Style $[w.resource] ...

You may use Current or ThisWindow instead of Pick depending on the needs.
No quotes should be used here, it is auto-single-quoted-and-escaped.
In older versions it is $n and $r, not $[w.name] and $[w.resource].

Regards,
Mikhael.

If this is actually the case, it is possible to reapply all
styles for a new/changed name using RecaptureWindow.

This still wouldn't work if the window doesn't have a unique
resource name.

The recently submitted patch to use window id as a style matcher would
fix this though.  Not that I'm advocating applying the patch, yet.

The endcaps are being combined with the main portion of the title bar,
making them appear about twice as bright.  This is inconsistent
behavior, since the button pngs are only combined with the background
color.  I think the behavior you're after is more useful, but I could
see both ways (combining with previous image and combining with color
only) being useful--perhaps there should be a MultiPixmap flag to
control this.

Applications may define the icon themselves, there are several hints
and several ways to do it and FVWM supports all of them.

Additionally, you may define your own images for iconified windows:

  ImagePath ~/.wm-icons:~/.fvwm/images:+

  Style Netscape* Icon my-netscape.xpm
  Style XTerm MiniIcon mini/terminal.xpm, Icon norm/terminal.xpm

In some cases you may want to override an icon supplied by an
application and only use your own configured icons:

  Style Eterm* IconOverride

Mikhael.

I am not against applying this patch (because it is small), but the
problems with it are obvious:

  1) We already have ambiguity, because we mix window names, resources
     and classes. This patch adds additional ambiguity.

  2) There is no any indication that this is a window id, so expect bugs.
     Do a simple experiment, create a window, apply a style to its id,
     close a window, open a completely another window, the old style is
     applied to it, because it has the same window id. I would think
     the styles working on window ids should expire at the moment a
     window is closed.

The proper solution is, of course, to have named patterns, with a syntax
similar to:

  Style (Class "XTerm", Name "user@host") ...
  Current (Class XTerm) Style (Id $[w.id]) MiniIcon ...
  Key S A CM  Pick Style (Id $[w.id]) SloppyFocus

This is still in todo list.

P.S. Please always send patches in "diff -u" format only.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello list!

I try to use FvwmButton to put DesktopIcons on my root window ... all
working very well but it would be great if i need to double-click to
icon, in the moment you need only to clikc once and that is really
annoying if you are not used to that... :)

Hi there,

this morning I experienced a problem using the following
key binding with version 2.5.6

DestroyFunc FocusRaise
AddToFunc FocusRaise I Raise
+ I Focus
+ I Iconify off

Key Tab A 4 Prev ("CurrentPage" "!Iconic" !"Fvwm*") FocusRaise

In version  2.5.3 and previous this keybinding circled
between _all_ windows on the current page starting with the
previous one.

In version 2.5.6 the keybinding toogles between the last
(prev) and the actual window. It seems that the order of
the WindowList is effected by the function above, which
should not be happen since I used "Focus" instead of
"FlipFocus".

Any ideas?

Uwe

Please always send mail to one of the fvwm lists.
In this case, fvwm@fvwm.org will do.

I closed your bug report based on this input from S. Anderson:

I found this bug report on the nedit site.
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=468569&group_id=11005&atid=111005
it says:

->>>>>>
  Date: 2002-06-20 19:53
  Sender: tringali
  Logged In: YES 
  user_id=11321

  We had problems with right-clicking with lock keys on.  
  That's been fixed in 5.3, but only to the extent that the menu 
  will not show if the lock keys are down.  But it won't lock up.

  In KDE, you might want to disable the "grab the right mouse
  button" flag.  It tends to screw up Motif bad.

  Also, send the first few lines from Help>Version.  If you're
  not
  running the binary from nedit.org, try that.  That's built with 
  the real Motif and behaves better.
<<<<<<-

I just checked, this window blanking bug does happen while using kde's 
window manager too.


I'm still not clear on what causes the problem, but it appears to
be an nedit problem.

Is this a silly question? Did I make a mistake? Is the
question not understandable?

i hate to say the obvious, but fvwm is not great, it's the best wm around.

if there were plenty of config files i doubt anyone would be using any
other (bloated) wms.

I would suggest to wait for more than 23 hours to repeat a question. :)

You are right, there is currently a bug in the developement version.
Focus behaves like FlipFocus. Some time ago it was vice versa in 2.5.x,
FocusFlip behaved like Focus.

Mikhael.

Actually, I think it'd be more like "if there were a graphical 
configuration client available i doubt anyone would be using any other 
(bloated) wms." At this point, I think that's all that's really keeping 
FVWM from the (now) popular gnome/kde crowd.

Even if the default-configuration would be a little more beautifull,
that would help a lot!
BTW: I use fvwm2.5.6 together with gnome2.2, that makes gnome useable

Hello list,

I want my unfocused windows to have a flat border, while my focused
window has a 3d-border. At the moment all windows have 3d-borders.

How can I solve that?

regards
	Klaus

Er, by reading the man page?  Search for BorderStyle, it does exactly
what you want (eg. BorderStyle InActive -- Flat).

Hi Rob.

I don't know who called you.  I've been waiting for them to
respond, but I guess its not going to happen.

Your name comes up from time to time on this list.
It came up recently when we were discussing Fvwm's 10th
birthday.

I haven't been paying a lot of attention to this, (I forget
birthdays all the time), but I believe we figured out that
the 10th anniversary of Fvwm's first release is June 1 of this year.

You appear in the birthday plans like this:

  C. Find Robert J. Nation

       Priority: medium
       Responsible: Dominik
       Status: ongoing

       Everybody is asked to help.  Hopefully we can find him, but we won't
       cancel the event if we do not.

Also this:

  B. Pictures of the developers

       Goal: Make a web page with pictures of the fvwm developers.
       Priority: low, nice to have
       Responsible: volunteer needed!
       Status: planning schedule

       Everybody who ever made a patch or helped designing any feature is
       welcome to provide a picture.

       20-May
        * Collect pictures of the developers.
          [pending]
       25-May
        * Make a web page with the pictures of the developers.
          [pending]

Thanks for getting back to us and I hope things are going well for you.
We've been enjoying working on Fvwm over the years and we owe you thanks
for getting this started.

PS: if you have a cat (or a close facsimile) you might want to
make it famous:

http://www.fvwm.org/fvwm-cats/

(Send the picture and caption to me.)

What version of Fvwm are you using?  2.0 isn't right.

How are you starting Fvwm or each DISPLAY?
Does each display have the same display depth?
Is what you are seeing colormap flashing?

No, it is not possible.

Note that FvwmWharf is principally not developed any more. You should use
FvwmButtons instead. If balloons appear, they will be in FvwmButtons, not
FvwmWharf.

Mikhael.

Hi FVWMers,
I have problems with some applications:
	Quake
	UMLinux (http://www.umlinux.de/)

When I change from this applications with ALT TAB or some other hot keys
like CTRL + CURSOR to another page or application. The original
application does not get the release of the modifier (ALT or CONTROL) in
this case alt or control. For user mode linux I solved this problem that
I accounted every pressed key and release this keys explicit when the
application looses foucus.

So now comes my Question: Is this the job of the window manager or the
job of the application?

Greetings,
	Thomas

i love the command line, but i also love saving keystrokes.
last night i got enlightened.

just added:

Mouse 4         R       A       Scroll +0 -100
Mouse 5         R       A       Scroll +0 +100

to my .fvwm2rc

and arranged my pager pages vertically

DeskTopSize 1x4

(just one desk)

and my mouse wheel on the root window now takes me to
other pages quickly and cleanly.

i warned it was a silly tip on the subject, so don't flame me, please.

The job of the application.  When it loses focus with a key
pressed, it can not assume that it will receive the key release
event.  It has to check the state of the keyboard when it receives
the focus again.  Fvwm can not propagate key events to unfocused
windows because it does not know which window should receive them.

Not quite.  It worked like it should for ClickToFocus and like
FlipFocus for MouseFocus and SloppyFocus.

Hello list

My problem today is, that I want no borders for the inactive windows to
save more space on my desktop.

BorderStyle inActive -- BorderWidth 0
or
BorderStyle inActive -- HandleWidth 0

did not work.

This time I looked in the manpage and played a bit around before asking
here, but with no sucess :-)

Regards
	Klaus

After changing that manualy it works.

But this happened on all my computers, so i guess there is a bug in the

I think windows without any border look ugly, but it is up to you.

There is no good way to do it currently. You can only define a border
width for all window states (active and inactive), and the syntax here
is, of course, using Style not BorderStyle.

Here is a trick that does not work relably, but it may kind of work if
you only have windows with different names:

  Style * HandleWidth 0
  FvwmAuto 0 "Style $n HandleWidth 5" "Style $n HandleWidth 0"
  #KillModule FvwmAuto

This is a case where individual window styles would help.

There is also a problem with some client window contents like xterm when
you dynamically change border width, at least in 2.5.x.

Another trick to try is to use new 2.5.6+ feature "BorderStyle Colorset"
and to define transparent borders, this way the border width is not
changed, but you at least may see the root background (but not overlapped
windows).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't think it's ugly, you can look at a screenshot:

Unfortunately you cannot see my transparent, colored and animated
mousecursor (xfree4.3) :-)

No, if there is just a workaround and if not all aplications work fine
with it, I don't want it. It's not that important to me. ;)

Yes, that's how I had solved it before writing the mail. And I'll leave

I have this for my mousewheel:

Mouse 5 R A Exec setmixer vol -5 pcm -5

So I can easily adjust the volume.

I don't like xinerama, because switching the pages switches them on all
screens, which I don't like. Dualhead is much cooler, I even can use
different windowmanagers if I want to. I don't need to move windows from
one screen to the other.

i have this three buttons on my titlebars

Mouse 0         2       A       Function "window_ops_func"
Mouse 0         4       A       Resize
Mouse 0         6       A       Iconify

but from time to time i remove them and get window_ops_func from 
right-clicking on the titlebar, so i can resize windows without
using handles or borders at all.

and pretty used to middle-clicking on the background and using the 
window ops menu to raise or resize windows anyway.

a tabed gtk terminal emulator. i administer clusters of application 
servers and oracle servers, and i need to log in on 15+ machines, but
the sight of 15 rxvt side to side get me nervous... two dzt windows
get me going nicely.

i used dual heads before, but a combination of sticky windows and fvwmmodules
with xinerama is what i prefer now. and from time to time i stretch a
window across the screens, specially big database diagrams and such.

Personally I find aiming at borders very tedious. I have alt-mouse-1 bound
to Resize in the Window context, and no borders at all. Aiming is _much_
easier (indeed, with focus-follows-mouse much of the time I don't need
to aim at all because the mouse is already there because I'm thinking
about that window already).

Cheers,

I was looking at the screenshots at fvwm.org, and saw one I really
like: the Taviso screenshot. So I was wondering if the author of
that screenshot was willing to share their fvwm config file. I'd
really appreciate it.

Thanks

Hey List,

i try to get an microgui-look on my window and used the pics from
fvwm-themes nanogui, but i have problems with their gradient for the
main part.... i used:

+ TitleStyle ActiveUp (MultiPixmap LeftEnd nano-titleleft-activeup.xpm, \
   Main VGradient 20 rgb:3c/5c/99 rgb:67/7f/c7, RightEnd
   nano-titleright-activeup.xpm)

The documentation says i can only use pixmap or solid, okay, but how
make the peaople from fvwm-themes that?

Mario

Hej list,

is there a way to move a window to the center of the screen? It seems i
can only move the upper-left point of a window to center but *not*
center the while window?

Version is 2.5.6

Hi all!! (this is my first post to the list :-)

To switch between the title bar at the top or at the bottom of the 
current window I have the following lines in my config

Mouse 0 8 A Current Style $n TitleAtTop
Mouse 0 0 A Current Style $n TitleAtBottom

However the natural way would be to have a "toggleable" button (can you 
say that?) that switches between both options. Is this possible (under 
2.4 preferibly)? I also have a similar pair of buttons for a "highlight 
style" and it would be nice to join them into only one button.

Thak you

David

This hopefully will give you a solution:

   http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0209/msg00404.html

"toggleable" is an ok term, but it means toggle between 2 states.
What you want is probably to toggle between 3 states, so this is not the
best term.

If you have 2 titlebar buttons just like now, you may make them look
toggleable if you use:

  Style * MwmButtons
  ButtonStyle 8 - MwmDecorLayer 6
  ButtonStyle 0 - MwmDecorLayer 2

Mikhael.

Not using MultiPixmap, because it is 2.5.x invention.
It uses an ugly solution - dummy titlebar buttons, you may use
MultiPixmap LeftEnd for this.

The file themes/nanogui/colors-decor describes how.
And if you want buttons, see themes/nanogui/buttons.

Try this:

> 2.4 preferibly)?

  Mouse 0 8 A Current Piperead "if [ $(( $[cw.y] - $[w.y] == $[cw.x] - $[w.x] )) = 1 ]; then echo Style $$n TitleAtTop; else echo Style $$n TitleAtBottom; fi"

But you need at least 2.5.1 for the $[cw...] variables.  This
script assumes that the window has the title at the bottom if the
client window is offset by the same amount from the top of the
frame as from the left.  I can't think of an easy way to do that
in 2.4.x.  Perhaps one could pass the window id and the frame id
to a shell script that uses xwininfo to determine the position of
the title bar.

> I also have a similar pair of buttons for a "highlight 
> style" and it would be nice to join them into only one button.

The state command in 2.5.1 can help you:

  AddToFunc toggle_hilight
  + I ThisWindow (!State 0) switch_hilight_on
  + I ThisWindow (State 0) switch_hilight_off
  + I ThisWindow State 0 toggle

  AddToFunc switch_hilight_on
  ...

  AddToFunc switch_hilight_off
  ...

Of course this works for the TitleAt... thing too.  If you really
want to keep 2.4.x, you can write the state of the window to an
environment variable and evaluate it with a shell script:
 
  AddToFunc toggle_title
  + I Style $n $0
  + I SetEnv bottomtitle_$w $1

  Mouse 0 8 A Current Piperead "if [ x$$bottomtitle_$w = x1 ]; then echo toggle_title TitleAtTop 0; else echo toggle_title TitleAtBottom 1; fi"

Bye

Try this:

  AddToFunc move_to_center
  + I Piperead "echo move $(( ($[vp.width] - $[w.width]) / 2 ))p $(( ($[vp.height] - $[w.height]) / 2 ))p"
