It's great that fvwm has the flexibility to emulate the OpenWin feature you

Ah hah!  I, or course, assumed an OR operation.  Should have RTFMed, it's
right there in the man page.

I used FVWM 1.20 at Sun Spark10 workstaion and upgraded to FVWM 2.0.40.
After install, I have some problem at FvwmPager (which worked well at
FVWM 1.20).

They are :

1. I set "DeskTopScale 32" at 1.20. But at 2.0, Pager looks much
   largier. I should set "*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale  48" to get a similiar
   size. (not exactly same)

2. I set "DeskTopSize 4x2" at 1.20. But at 2.0, the vertical size of
   each page is doubled. I should set DeskTopSize 2x2 or 4x4 to get
   a right window shape.

3. I set "FvwmAuto 100". But when I move mouse pointer on the FvwmPager,
   it doesn't raise on top. All the other windows work well. Only Pager
   has the error.

4. I place FvwmButtons and FvwmPager at top-right corner of the screen.
   (*FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1, *FvwmButtonsGeometry -1+1) At, 1.20 they
   are not overlapped(Pager automatically placed left of Buttons),
   but at 2.0 they are overlapped.

I don't know whether these problems are because of the error in new
version, or my setting in .fvwmrc. Can anybody help me ?

thanks

Hi,
I remember reading a discussion about how people managed to do something 
similar to the nonexistant StartsOnPage attribute, fiddling with some 
variables like WINDOWHEIGHT/WIDTH or SCREENHEIGHT/WIDTH.... 
I would like to have some applications be placed on a certain Page (NOT 
Desk) but when I specify a geometry, the placement is relative to the 
current page, not the top-left page. 
Could you post this .fv* excerpts again please?
TIA
Frank.
PS: Thanks to Aaron <aaron@mccabe.com> for his top-down left-right 
window-placement patch. I needed this for some time w/out being exactly 
aware of it ;-)

HI

I have installed FVWM 2.0.40 on a SONY NWS1250 with NEWSOS 4.1C

I have no strstr.o and strdup.o in my system librarys I think these functions 
should be supplied with the fvwm distribution. 

In Module FvwmDebug

there must be an NEED_WAIDPID
for machines the does not have waitpid and uses wait3.

In the same manner like in fvwm/misc.h

Thanks

I seem to recall stumbling across a reference to a FileMgr in WWW
Fvwm1 documentation some time ago. Is there a Fvwm2 version
available, can I use the Fvwm1 version if not, and if there is
where might I get my grubby hands on a copy? (Phew!)

Some users here still use Suns File Manager, which is fine, except that
it is a complete mess when it comes to placing and controlling its icons.
The WasteBasket in particular seems to appear stubbornly in the same
place, regardless of how inconvenient that place is. I don't use
it myself so I don't suffer!

Thanks.

  The answer I got was that XDM doesn't set the group permissions 
correctly when you log in. I'll try playing around with xdm when I have 
some time...

Opps!  Another FAQ entry I forgot...

The FvwmFileMgr module dissappeared because a file manager doesn't
need to be integrated with a window manager and xfm does a much better
job.  I recommend you pick that up instead (from ftp.x.org or your
favorite mirror).

Yes, any geometry spec is relative to the current page.  For now you
have to deal with that.  I don't recall seeing anyone post excerpts
from a .fvwmrc, though if you use FvwmM4 (and I presume FvwmCpp),
there will be HEIGHT and WIDTH variable set for you that you can use.
I do it all out of my .X11Startup file which looks something like
this:

#! /bin/sh

[...]
SCREENWIDTH=`xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | cut -dx -f1 | cut -d: -f2`
SCREENHEIGHT=`xdpyinfo | grep dimensions | cut -dx -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1`
export SCREENWIDTH SCREENHEIGHT
[...]
xterm -geometry +0+`expr $SCREENHEIGHT` &

Hello!

When linking FVWM2.0.39 using gcc on Sun-OS 4.1.4 with Openwindows 3.0
I get an "Undefined symbol _basename" fatal error message from ld, which 
then exits. (For details see below.)

Question: Does any one have an idea how I can avoid this?

There is a similar problem for module FvwmPrompt, shown at the end.

(I'm more or less a novice in X, C and Unix programming, so the issue
might be silly. I just don't have any more experiended person available
locally.)

Thanks in advance!

Some notes:

I've noted that there is a call to "basename" (without leading "_") 
in function "usage" in file "fvwm.c". During the compilation I get 
an get warning(s) for it, as show in the listing below.

Using "nm -og" on /usr/openwin/lib/lib* ( and /lib/lib* ) gives the
following information relating to "_basename" :

> nm -og /usr/openwin/lib/lib* |grep -i basename

Trying to add "/usr/openwin/lib/libtt.a" to the linking does not help.

I get a similar error in FvwmPrompt. Does it have the same reason?

Edit fvwm.c and remove the call to basename().  Or pick up 2.0.40
where it's already removed (and deal the missing 'XLoadQuery...'
problem that might happen by applying the patch below).

Jan-Erik> There is a similar problem for module FvwmPrompt, shown at

It looks like -lm is missing from the link line, for some unknown
reason.  I wouldn't worry about it though - use FvwmForm instead.
I'll probably be removing FvwmPrompt in the next release, since
FvwmForm has similiar function, but is more powerful and aesthetically
pleasing.

Well, that's one reason why this list exists.

When I use the OpenWin MailTool, I usually do not have trouble, other
than the message window occasionally coming up iconified.

I have noticied, though, that if I get a message with an attachment, then
the message window has trouble dealing with it.  When I open the message,
the attachment portion of the window will not show until I resize or
move the message window, and once I move on to a message without an
attachment, the attachment portion of the window becomes all grey, and
will not disappear until the window is again resized or moved.

Does anyone know if this is a bug or if there is a fix for it?

You pointed out (from my previous post) the FAQ was supplied with
fvwm-2.0.xx.  It was...I got it...I read it (no kidding)!

What the heck...I've got the source now..Let's compile it and upgrade!

Well!...I'm running fvwm-2.0.40.

Nice Work!

Hello,

Suggestion:

Just played with FvwmForm.  Nice thing.  However, I think it will be
nice to be able to put pixmaps there...

Bug report:

I noticed this (strange ?) behaviour:

If the QuitVerify window is popped up and I press some binded key
(i.e. Ctrl-F1 which should start emacs), the corresponding action is
taken, but the next time I will use a key binding, fvwm will go crazy.
The only way to make it work again is to restart X.

Also I have noticed that while pressing the Logout or Cancel buttons
with the mouse (in the QuitVerify dialog box) is very fast (it reacts
imediately by quiting or closing the dialog box), pressing Enter or
Escape is very slow (it waits a second or so before performing the
corresponding action).



This is from fvwm's TODO:

        - Find out why closing windows fills the area w/ the border color

I just noticed that precisely the same thing happens under mwm !!!!!
Every window that is about to be closed first clears its content with
the border color and then exists.  Really strange...  I thought it was
a fvwm problem... Could this be an X configuration problem ?

Best regards,
Tudor

Hi,

I'm new on this mailing list, and know only little about fvwm
versions. So I would like to hear if anybody knows when a 'final' 2.0
release will be ready, or if there even exist a plan for when a
release will be 'final'. E.g. shall all things in the TODO list be
implemented?

/Ulrik

PS. I didn't find this info anywhere, maybe a README or FAQ file

If I try this in FVWM 2.0.40 I get a blank(white button and the xclock usage 
print out in my xdm-errors file.

*FvwmButtons -  clock.xpm   Swallow "xclock" xclock -hl red -bg white

Hi all!
yesterday, aaron <aaron@mccabe.com> posted a patch to fvwm/placement.c 
that would cause fvwm to place new windows in a top-down before 
left-right fashion. While I must say that I love this behaviour, I just 
found a problem: When a window appears to be higher than the page, fvwm 
locks, and the window won't appear! 

I tried the default placement code: it has no problems with either wider 
and higher windows than the Display, so this is probably easy to fix?

TIA 
Frank

I have just converted to fvwm from vtwm and I like what I see.
A feature I really liked in vtwm, was you could have seperate window
lists for applications, eg one for all your xterms, for for emacs
windows. Is this possible in fvwm ? If so how ?

My standard answer is 'The first official 2.xx release will occur
"Real Soon Now", whatever "Real Soon Now" actually means'.  There is
still more cleanup that needs to be done, particularily in the docs
and build process, and then I'll release it, but it will by no means
be a 'final' release.  The items on the TO-DO list will probably never be
fully completed, and are completely unrelated to the

Both the ChangeLog and the FAQ indicate that the first official
release will be 2.1.0, indicating that I am working towards that goal.
I should probably put my standard answer above in there somewhere
though.  And I'll be sure to put it on the forthcoming official FVWM
web page too.

This would be a nice feature to have; but one for the TODO list right
now, I suspect.

How about a Sytle parameter specifying the textual name of a list to
put that window in, and then the WindowList built-in could take an
argument specifying a list of window lists to include?

The latest version of FVWM 2.xx is 2.0.40, and it is still beta code.
Quite useable beta code, but still beta...

I hope to release the first official version (it will be 2.1.0) "Real
Soon Now", whatever that may mean...

If you download the FvwmIconMan-0.2.tar.gz file in /pub/fvwm/misc from 
ftp.htc.uhu.edu you might get somthing like what you are looking for. It 
is an Icon Manager module for FVWM written by Brady Montz that hasn't yet 
been included in the releases. It is designed to be similar to the one in vtwm.
 I use it, but I don't use the multi-manager options. With a little 
tinkering it should do what you want.

I'm trying to get the sample QuitVerify form in the FvwmForm man page
working. I have the following menu entry:

+			"QuitVerity Form"	Module FvwmForm QuitVerify


When I try and invoke this nothing appears and upon inspection of my
.xsession-errors file I find:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range
for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  24
  Current serial number in output stream:  34

Any ideas what is happening??? 

All of my other modules work fine so I don't think it's an
installation problem. I'm running a Tatung Sparc w/ SunOS 4.1.4,
gcc-2.7.0, X11R6.

Thanks for any advice.

I have this problem, I use some SUN tools such as "mailtool", "cm",
"perfmeters", and shelltool (I only use shelltool windows for certain
systems).

I don't want a icon title for these tools so I use the "NoIconTitle"
style for them.  The problem is that when I start Fred (This is what I
like to call fvwm.  I figured there was a "Tom's window manager", why
not a "Fred's Virtual Window Manager" ;-{)  I've got everyone at my
work calling it Fred also) these icons do not startup at the hard coded
positions specfied (e.g. mailtool -Wp 182 0 -Ws 585 281 -WP 943 0  -Wi)
but rather in the upper left corner.

When I click on these icons they snap to their designated coordinates.
This also happens on a restart.

Also when I use the module "FvwmIdent" on these icons nothing comes
back, but xwininfo has no problems.

If I remove the "NoIconTitle"  everything works as it should.

This is very annoying.

I am using Suns openwin (I wish I didn't have to, but I do) on a
Solaris 2.3 Sparc 5, Compiled with ANSI c, Fvwm Version 2.0.40, using
X11R5.

I reported this problem back when I first started using fvwm2 pl35.
This problem did not exist in Fvwm Version 1.24r.

One last thing, I saw someone else mention this problem but have not
seen any responce.  Every time I do a restart I see an error like
this:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x3400003
  Serial number of failed request:  1892
  Current serial number in output stream:  1893


Could it be something in my rc file?

This is also very annoying.

Any help or suggestions would be great.

Thank You

I managed to find this little item as well...It compiled OK but it will 
not run...whenever I try to run it nothing happens. I do a "ps -u" and 
according to it I'm not running it. Any help would be appreciated.

Is there a way to get you icons to go to a different part of the screen 
when you minimize an application? (i.e. instead of at the bottom left of 
the screen ... usualy under a window!! :( ) I've tried to get the 
FvwmIconBox & FvwmIconMan both to work but neither seem to want work for 
me. The IconBox comes up and when I minimize something it does't go into 
the box and the IconMan doesn't even come up for me. Thanks.

Uhm, don't forget the bugs section from fvwm 1.2's man-pages:

     As of fvwm 0.99 there were exactly 39.342 unidentified bugs.
     Identified  bugs  have mostly been fixed, though. Since then
     9.34 bugs have been fixed.  Assuming that there are at least
     10  unidentified  bugs for every identified one, that leaves
     us with 39.342 - 9.32 + 10 *  9.34  =  123.402  unidentified
     bugs.  If  we  follow this to its logical conclusion we will
     have an infinite number  of  unidentified  bugs  before  the
     number  of  bugs  can  start to diminish, at which point the
     program will be bug-free.  Since this is a computer  program
     infinity  =  3.4028e+38  if  you  don't  insist  on  double-
     precision. At the current rate of bug  discovery  we  should
     expect  to  achieve  this point in 3.37e+27 years. I guess I
     better plan on passing this thing on to my children....

Hmm something is wrong here, he (R. Nation) hasn't passed it on to his
children??

	I had the same problem with the Icon Manager at first too. It did the 
exact same thing: It ran in the background but didn't appear on the 
screen. To fix it I had to install a later version of FVWM. You have to be 
running FVWM v1.24r or later.(I was using 1.21c). You also have to properly 
indicate/make the config.h file. (Examples are in the config directory that 
come with the .tar) If you compile on an SGI (I did) it doesn't come with a 
release but, I have a config.h file that worked (for me) under IRIX 5.3. 
If you want it, e-mail me and I'll post it OR e-mail Brady Montz at: 
  bradym@cs.arizona.edu

He was very helpful when I had similar problems. Since I got it working 
on the SGI I have compiled it under Linux on my Dad's PC for home use and 
had no problems there either. 

	Jon Watson
PS -  I noticed I was kinda vague in my last message about the Icon 
manager and if it supported the multiple window lists. Yes it does support 
multiple managers showing specific things, (ie. 1 manager shows emacs, 1 
shows xterms) but I don't use those features. There is an example of how 
to do that in the documentation tho.

Howdy Boys & Girls,

I'm announcing the new Official FVWM WWW page!  Please check out:

                     http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/

and let me know what you think.  It's certainly not complete, but it's
a good start, I think.  After I get some feedback and polish it up a
little more I'll announce it to the rest of the world.

And Thanks to Jason for setting me up with the space to put it on
hpc.uh.edu!

Later,
Chuck

Hi Chuck.  Thanks so much for putting out the fvwm WEB page.  I have
been using fvwm 1.24 for about a year and don't know how I ever got
by without it.  About 3 months ago I tried one of the 2.x beta
releases.  I eventually decided not to use it because it seemed 
to me that:

Iconified stick xterm clients were the same color as non-sticky ones.
I couldn't change this.  Is there now a way?

Iconified clients in 1.24 tended to get put on unused parts of the root
window.  I made this the upper right corner.  In the 2.x version I looked
at, I could iconify something and it would sometimes disappear, under
some other client, and I couldn't easily find it.

Deiconifying clients resulted in their being placed on the bottom of the
stacking order, instead of the top in 2.x.  Has this behavior changed?
I would like deiconified clients to appear on the top of the stack.


I confess, I'm not even close to an fvwm expert.  I did read some 
directions, and try to get the desired behavior, and failed.
So, either I can't get what I want becuase it is no longer possible
or, I just didn't try enough things.

If you have any brief comments about this, I would really appreciate
it.  I'd like to move on to version 2.x, but I really need the
above features first.

regards,

I am sorry,
I van not browse the WWW.
I do have a question for you though,
is there allready a ``official'' (non-beta) release of fvwm 2?

Im looking forward to install fvwm 2 on our systems, but since that
involves 4 different platforms (maybe even five if I cannot run tha
aix3.2.5 binary on aix4.1.4) I'd rather wiat for a stable (or at least
non-beta) version to come out.

Thanks

scotth@netstar.com sent me what I believe is a fairly cogent
explanation.  Once you have your iconboxes defined (see below), you can
specify which type of app goes into which iconbox thusly (e.g.):

  Style "*"           DecorateTransient,IconBox 0 0 -1 70
  Style "XTerm"       IconBox 0 -70 -1 -1

With these specifications, xterm icons go into iconbox {0 -70 -1 -1},
and all other icons go into iconbox {0 0 -1 70}.  For me, this puts most
of the icons along the top, and xterms go in along the bottom, both from
left to right.


hth,
tw

========================================================================
Basically you define the upper left corner and the lower right
corner of the iconbox.

Iconbox 100 200 300 400

The upper left corner is 100 pixels in from the left side of the
screen, 200 pixels down from the top of the screen. The lower
right corner is 300 pixels in from the left side of the screen,
400 pixels down from the top of the screen.

Nope, not yet.  It's still beta.  Standard response:

  I hope to have the First Official 2.xx Version (it'll be 2.1.0) out
  "Real Soon Now". It requires a little more polishing, like Doc
  updates, Compile/Install procedure fixes, some more bugfixes, etc.

I hope that the AIX 3.2.5 will run under 4.1.4, but I was told by
some people around here that it didn't for them.

Anyways, there are some more changes coming up soon, and I hope for
that to be the release that helps me polish up the last little bit for
the first official 2.xx release.

The thing is that I got the module to compile but it just doesn't do 
anything for me. I list off all the processes that I'm running and it is 
not there. I'm not gettting any error messages or anything it just isn't 
working. If it's any help I compiled it under SunOS 5.4 and I'm running 
Fvwm 2.0.38.

The questions you have to ask are as follows:
	1. Did you use the correct file for config.h?? There is a solaris 
	   one in the config directory: <FvwmIconMan dir>/config/solaris

	2. Assuming you used the correct config.h (you copied it to 
	   ../config.h or soft-linked it to ../config.h), did you specify 
	   the correct FVWM version switch?? You should have added the 
	   following to the "DEFINES" line: -DFVWM_VERSION=2
	   When I just looked at the solaris example file I noticed there 
	   was no header stuff. If you look in another example (ie. linux)
	   you'll see the following lines commented out at the top:
		# -DNEED_UCHAR if uchar isn't typedef'd for you already
		# -DNEED_ULONG if ulong isn't typedef'd for you already
		# -DFVWM_VERSION=2 if you are compiling for fvwm 2.0

	3. Did you run 'make depend' before compiling? If not run 'make 
	   clean', then 'make depend', then 'make'. (I assume you did if 
   	   you got it to compile, but it wasn't in the instructions. :)

	So if you didn't use that switch, I would expect it not to work. 
Those lines don't seem to appear in either the 'solaris' or 'sunos4', and 
the 'make depend' as I recall, isn't in the directions. I run it on an 
SGI so I had to hack my own config.h...G'Luck!

There was some dicussion of button styles here recently.  Here is one
that I made to bind to the "stick" function.  It is three horizonal lines
like those that appear in the title bar when a window is sticky.

ButtonStyle 4 12 10x23@0 90x23@0 90x28@0 10x28@1 10x48@1 90x48@0 90x53@0 10x53@1 10x71@2 90x72@0 90x77@0 10x77@1

Hi,

I was wondering, why was OpaqueResize taken out in fvwm2.0? The FAQ says 
one should use fvwmPager instead, but I don't see how to duplicate the 
functionality with that.

You can't duplicate the OpaqueResize behaviour right now, but if you
check the TO-DO list, I plan to bring it back (after the style flags
fix).

I'm just guessing, but I think it was removed because:

  - Rob didn't think it was used all that much
  - It takes a fair amount of system resources durning resizes
  - Ran out of style flags, so it couldn't be implemented on a per
    window basis

Opps!  Actually, it looks like I forgot to put it in there, although I
knew that I wanted to do that.  It'll be in there for the next
release.

In fvwm-2.0.40 (and prior versions) maximize doesn't (for me).  rather
it just moves the window to the top of the screen.  Is this a bug or a 
misconfiguration?  Also, I'd to be able to configure exactly what maximize
does on a per window basis... possible?

p.s.: I'm new to the list...

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

Does fvwm v2.x support tabbing a la twm?  To make sure we're talking
about the same thing: what I'm looking for is the ability to make the
title bar just wide enough to hold the window title (and whatever
buttons end up in the title bar).  In twmrc, this is called option
"SqueezeTitle".  I find this feature invaluable in giving fast and
convenient access to multiple stacked windows.

If it hasn't been implemented yet, any chance that it will be added
soon?  If not, what's the reason for not implementing it?  I'd love to
switch to fvwm but can't do so until tabbing is supported.

Thanks in advance!

Discovered a timing bug in the FvwmPager on Solaris 2.4, with both OpenWindows
and the Consortium X11R6 server.

FvwmPager, when moving a window to the current desk, does an XReparentWindow
followed by an XSetInputFocus. The XSetInputFocus can get the following error:


  X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  5232
  Current serial number in output stream:  5247    

By adding a XSync, a "sleep_a_little(50000)", and another XSync just before
the XSetInputFocus the problem goes away. The patch is attached.

50 ms may be a bit long for the sleep; I haven't tried shorter periods, though.

This button looks a little funky to me.  The spacing between the lines
is a little uneven.  I changed it so it matches the way the title bar
looks when it's sticky, at least on my system:

ButtonStyle 8 12 10x23@0 90x23@0 90x28@0 10x28@1 10x47@1 90x47@0 90x52@0 10x52@1 10x70@2 90x70@0 90x76@0 10x76@1

I was going through my mailbox clearing stuff out, and I was re-reading
this thread and thinking... What I'd really like to see is something
like Smartplacement, but in addition to avoiding existing windows, it
tries _really_ hard not to get between the pointer and the currently
focused window.

Something that made new windows avoid the pointer, is what I'm trying
to say. :^) I hate it when a new window pops up and eats what I've been
typing...

Fvwm doesn't have this feature of twm.

I doubt it...  Or if so, at least not soon.

David> If not, what's the reason for not implementing it?

Well, I'll give a few:

1. I've only browsed twm and hadn't really seen that feature until I
   tried it after your note came in.  Then I read the man page to
   get a little more info on it.

2. I'm not trying to emulate every feature of every window manager
   (this includes win95) out there.  One of fvwm's goals is to be
   (stay) small and fast, and adding more features generally
   detracts from this.  I'm pretty selective.  Generically powerful
   features that don't cost too much memory, speed, or code
   complexity have a possibility of being added to fvwm.  Other
   things should be added as modules, perhaps.  If they can be.

3. If I were to implement it, it should probably be part of the
   recently added TitleStyle stuff, and all of that moved as a parm
   under the Style command, and I'm all out of style flags for the
   moment.  Perhaps after the 'Great Style Flag Rewrite' which will
   occur shortly after the seemingly mythical 'First Official 2.xx
   Release'.  But then, do we want the added memory overhead of
   title style info added to each window?  Can it be arranged to be
   cheap as far as memory usage goes?  Possibly...

4. Doc updates, build/install process fixes, and bugfixes are more
   important to me than most other things right now, mostly to help
   reach the 'First Official 2.xx Release' goal.

David> I'd love to switch to fvwm but can't do so until tabbing is
David> supported.

That's unfortunate.  But if that's the feature that makes it for you,
and no other features of fvwm make you want to switch, you're probably
better off sticking with twm (or perhaps ctwm, vtwm, or tvtwm, which
all have this feature as well since they are more directly spawned
from twm) for the time being.  You've got to use what works for you.

>>>>> "Jeff" == Jeff S Elam <jselam@SSD.intel.com> writes:

Jeff> That sounds like a GREAT feature.  I second the request!

I think it sounds interesting, but never having used it I'm having a
hard time seeing how it would be more useful than having the full
sized titles, which really don't take up that much more room.

Perhaps my typical window layouts make a difference here, since I can
see that they probably wouldn't benefit at all from this feature.

I can see a potential benefit if you like to lay out your windows
overlapping horizontally.  Do you do this?  Do a lot of people out
there do this?

I'll have to think about this feature...  I'll add it to the TO-DO
list with a question mark to remind me to investiage it when I get a
chance, but I can't make any guarantees.

If people can provide examples to sway me one way or the other, that'd
be helpful.

Hmmm... sounds like yet another "Style" addition.  After all, it would also
be nice to specify that some windows *do* come up under the cursor; when I
hit the reply button on my mail handler (exmh) I want the resulting window
to come up under the cursor so I can start typing, not away from the cursor
where I have to go chase it. :-)

Yes, that's exactly what I'm using it for.  My typical layout consists
of about half a dozens xterms and one emacs window spread along the
screen bottom.  Graphically, it looks something like this (assuming
xterm1 is on top of the other xterms and emacs is on top of xterm4):

	+--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+
	| xterm1 | | xterm2 | | xterm3 | | xterm4 | | emacs  |
	+--------+-----------------------------+--+-+--------+-------//
	|				       |    |
	|				       |    |
        |				       |    |
        |       			       |    |
	|				       |    |
	|				       |    |
	+--------------------------------------+----+---------------//

Thus, the tabs give direct access to any window.  With full title
bars, the above configuration would imply that xterm2 and xterm3 would
be hidden behind xterm1.

I *do* appreciate your efforts to avoid bloating fvwm.  However, I
also believe that tabbing is not just another "feature"---it really
can improve efficiency in interacting with a windowing system.

It's easy to see what benefit this would have to people adopting this style
of layout.

However, I have a few points/questions:

  1. How would you handle the identification of sticky windows?  If you
     squeeze the title bar real tight, they'll be no room left for the
     stripes.  I guess you could add a few pixels either side and stripe
     those.

  2. Don't you think it may look a little silly with fvwm's mwm-style 3d
     borders.  twm has very simple window decorations and I agree that this
     type of title suits it well.  I thought it would so I got out my trusty
     gif editor (xpaint) and modified a current window grab.  I've included
     the result at the end of this message.  It doesn't look as bad as I
     thought it would, but I still don't know whether I like it.

  3. Looking at the fvwm code, it would probably require a bunch more windows
     (internal windows, not user windows) to model this.  That would add a
     fair overhead per user window which would increase the footprint of
     fvwm.  I think that twm's simplistic styling avoids much of this and
     so can get away with it.

I could see it being useful as I tend to use large fonts and large
windows, so they overlap a lot. That's why I requested the smarter
drawing routines to tile the windows from a defined corner gravity.

As to implementation on fvwm, I can't see it making sense unless you use
the tab to substitute for all the features in the current title bar.
Also it would seem to me code would also be needed to make the tabs
smart, so they could reshuffle themselves around when new windows were
overlapped on old ones to make the tabs all visible.

I agree with David.  Although I try not to let my desktops get
cluttered, I invariably have at least 6 xterms open on the same desktop by
the end of the day.  I know lots of people who like using those little 80x24
xterms, but personally I like to see as much of a file as I can, so I use lots
of nice, tall xterms that end up covering each other up.  I often find myself
"Lower"ing windows over and over again in search of a particular one.

I would LOVE to have a "tab" feature like this one to help me quickly pull
up the xterm I'm looking for.

However, I also agree that fvwm should be kept nice and small, so if this
feature impacts the size or speed of fvwm significantly and it can't be done
in a module, than punt it.

I think lots of people are missing the point of fVwm.  Tabs are essential, when
you are limited to a single desktop.  With multiple desktops, tabs are kinda
silly.  Admittedly, someone who has acquired their organizational habits from
twm will desire tabs no matter how many desktops/windows they have configured,
BUT that individual is probably better off sticking with twm if they aren't
interested in trying new organizational methods.

Personally, if I wanted to organize things in that manner, I'd bind FvwmWinList
to the right mouse button (done it), and use *that* to pull the appropriate
window to the fore.  I'd also use styles so that my "per machine" windows
grouped themselves together on a common desktop.

A current window count shows 23 open windows on my machine right now.  This is
hardly maximal for me.

FvwmWinList also provides something almost exactly like what has been
described, albeit vertically instead of horizontally and not attached
to the windows. Perhaps an enhancement to allow FvwmWinList to be
horizontal as well as vertical will give people what they want?

With a window layout like that, I agree that it would help.  But in
the meantime, are there other alternatives?  Let's see what others
have to say:

The 'tab' is really just a shrunk down version of the title bar, so it
would theoretically retain all the old properties, just be smaller.

Those extra pixels would be needed to indicate that, yes.  On a
related note, I'd like to bring back the alternate color for sticky
windows as an option too, if possible.  Although that might not be
possible, since I know Rob removed it because getting it to work

I didn't look at your picture, but I looked at what it looks like in
ctwm, and yes I think it looks pretty silly that way.  And it would
probably look about the same in fvwm, although maybe it could be
cleaned up.

Olly>   3. Looking at the fvwm code, it would probably require a bunch

Depending on how it's done, I would have to agree here.  But if the
titlebar window were just shrunk and the borders just followed it and
left the top of the actual window bare (which is what ctwm does) then
it wouldn't require any more additional windws (at least I don't think
it would).

But it would still require other info to be in the FvwmWindow
structure, and it would require more calculations and checking when
bordering windows.  It might be rather complex to add.  I won't know
until I look through the code some more and play a little with it.

I'm one of those small font small xterm people myself, but I have a
button on my title bar to maximize the window vertically if need be,
which I sometimes do.  But then I shrink 'em back down again.

Jeff> I would LOVE to have a "tab" feature like this one to help me

True, but then again so does the builtin window list (or the
FvwmWindowList module for that matter).  And that doesn't matter what
your current window setup is or what the titlebars look like.

I couldn't have said it better myself...

Hey - another related note came in.  Let's follow that up here too...

This (multiple virtual desktops) is the very reason why I switched to
fvwm in the first place originally.  My mwm screen was just too
littered with windows (and too slow on my rather pitiful machine at
work).

Right now I have about 33 windows spread across 4 pages of one 2x2
virtual desktop.  Alternately I could have chosen 4 individual
desktops to achieve the same effect.  And this way, I agree, no need
for tab style titlebars.

Although switching windows this way could be slower than just clicking
on the tabs.

Or perhaps ctwm, vtwm, or tvtwm, which have similiar virtual
capabilities plus the old SqueezeTitle tabs.

Very similiar to what I suggested above.  These are some good ideas to
work with the large window styles without the tabs.  And that is
probably just as fast and easy as the tabs would be.

Another way would be to use Prev/Next Focus to switch between windows.
This would be real good for large windows, especially if there weren't
too many of them (say <10).  That way you wouldn't even need to reach
for the mouse.

Brian> A current window count shows 23 open windows on my machine
Brian> right now.  This is hardly maximal for me.

And my count of 33 above was much larger earlier too.  But still very
usable and not too hard to find any particular window.  Even easier if
I were to rename a few of my xterms uniquely.

I don't know - whether the text were shrunk, or rotated, or wrapped

Well, it looks perfectly fine to me.  I included a variant below.
Right now, I prefer the looks of your version, but it may be that with
a little work on the 3d decorations, the version below could be made
to look just as good.  I included it mainly because I thought it might

Could this be implemented so that the additional X windows are

Huh?  Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly. I was thinking that FvwmWinList
could have an Orientation, say, which would be either "horizontal" or "vertical"

"Vertical" would be like it is now; "horizontal" would be a horizontal row of
buttons (take the current FvwmWinList and layout the buttons side-by-side instea
d
of on top of each other).

I wasn't thinking of having tall, thin buttons, which by your reply seems to
be what you though of.

Yep, much easier.  It wouldn't require any additional windows or structures.

Yes, but you'd still probably need place-holders which would inflate the
actual window structure and the code would be quite complex (as pointed out
by Chuck).  Of course, I'm looking at it (as always) from the point of view
of having it a configurable option rather than a #ifdef compile alternative.

I think if you're happy with the look of your modified image you sent,
you should go with that.  It should be fairly trivial to implement compared
to anything more intricate.

Now, it's a question of actually doing it.  I'll put it on my list of
"fvwm hacks to attempt" but it would be down at number 3 at least.
Chuck has also implied that it would be low down on his list.

A while back on this list, there was a discussion about implementing
window styling in a module.  It's definitely the thing to do if we
can figure some way of doing it without slowing things down too much.
Maybe through dynamic loading rather than piping between separate
executables...

It's got to be the logical way to satisfy the look- half of everyone's
look-and-feel tastes.

OK, that sounds good.  I might try it myself but it has been a long
time since I programmed X last and it looks like I'll have plenty of
fun porting GNU libc to Linux/Alpha.  If you get to do it first, I'd
obviously be very interested in hearing about it.

Though I haven't used any thing like this, I agree that it is a useful feature.
It has lower priority that bug fixes and a stable release, but then ...

I use ctwm but don't use the tab feature.  I have many many xterms all
the very same size all at +0+0 and I use the IconManager to choose the
right xterm (I have Alt-CursorUp and Alt-CursorDown bound to moving in
the IconManager).

That would be an alternative for you tabbing-friends out there.

I don't know if the I'd go so far to say tabs are silly...But Brian makes 
a good point: Why lump all your stuff together on 1 desktop when you can 
spread it over a bunch?? I run about 5-10 xterms and applications. You 
don't need tabbing if you have multiple desktops. The other thing I do is 
bind Raise/Lower to the F1 key...If I stack related windows on a desktop I 
can tap through them quckly with that. Just use a 3x1 vitual desktop and the 
'paging' feature to jump from desktop to desktop. There's my 2 bits...

I can't actually look at these because they're encoded base64 instead of
uuencode, (how do you decode a base64 message?) but remember that to do
tabs, you need to invoke the shape extensions of X11. The shape extensions
have always seemed EXTREMELY slow to me. You might get away with it,
beause they are all going to rectangular shapes. To get a feel for this,
try resizing an oclock, and see how long it takes to complete (almost
a second for me).

Unless of course the information is intimately related, and you have to deal
with short term windows.  Trying to compare info in windows spanned across
desktops means a lot of switching.  And if you create some short term windows,
and then end up moving over your desktop, you either have to make them 
sticky or switch between desktops again.  The point isn't how YOU do it.  I
use two desktops 1x1 and cram a lot of windows into them.  My Open/Close
and Front/Back keys get quite a workout.  Even on my Sparc-5 I find the 
difference between the window switching delay and window fronting
to be more than I care to deal with.  While I probably will continue in
my current pattern, there seems to be a lot of people who keep saying
"You're doing it wrong!", as if their way was the only way.

You need munpack and mpack. They're on most mime support sites, so you
should be able to find them with archie or one of the web search
engines.

Included is a variations I like, modified from another one posted here

Ifd the top-level window is not rectangular, you need the shape extensions.
What you have is two rectangles which are placed together. I believe that
this would require shape extensions.

Just so everyone knows what Rob is referring to here - all of the
decorations and the app window have this top level parent window
courtesy of fvwm, which if it were to contain two different sized
windows like that would require the SHAPES extension.

The SHAPES extension, as Rob noted, is definitely slow at times,
unless you have a really good machine and a graphics card optimized
for special X stuff (like the SGI machines, perhaps).

I've poked around the code somewhat, and looked at how [c]twm does
this, and based on that and these discussions, adding this 'tab'
feature would not be trivial work.

I know people out there like this feature, and if it works well for
your way of working that's great, but I have this feeling that it may
not appear.  Or if it does, definitely not for some time.

I'm sorry 'bout this, but as I've said in the past there are a lot of
cool features and ideas out there but we can't satisfy everyone all
the time.  Don't let this deter you from making suggestions and
requests though!

If people out there absolutely cannot live without this feature, you
have a few choices:

  1. Continue to use [c,tv,v]twm instead.
  2. Hack the fvwm code yourselves.  I can't guarantee that I'll add
     any patches you send, but I will at least look at them.
  3. Find an alternate way to do what you want (or as close as
     possible) with existing fvwm features, either with a small change
     in your window stacking order, multiple virtual pages and/or
     desktops, special keybindings, the winlist or winlist module
     (with Grant's proposed horizontal option perhaps), the IconMan
     module, etc.

Back to the grind...

I'm just about to release FvwmIconMan 0.3, but I have one last bug that I just
can't squish. This problem has actually been around since forever, and I
want to get rid of it for once and all.

For those who have't used it, for this problem just think of it like WinList.

When the user specifies a geometry with a negative y coordinate, then the
manager window should grow upwards. To do this, I need to move the window,
then resize it (I actually use XMoveResizeWindow). To do this, I need to
know what the global location of my window is.

Looking at the fvwm source code, it appears that fvwm puts two layers of
parents on top of all managed windows, one immediately containing the window, 
and then the frame window. Is this correct, and if it's correct, is it
consistently correct? Cause then I'll just go back to the grandfather window
to figure out my global location. If not, then are there any suggestions?

That's what I think as well.  I tried it for a day or two, and it can
be nice, but, personally, I use too many windows of varying sizes
(xterms, xcalc, exmh, editors, file managers, xconsole, xv, games;
I've all these open at this moment) for it to be comfortable.  In
my experience, this style was suitable best when there were a lot of
independently used windows (i.e., there is no need to have many visible
at the same time).

My own solution is to use several virtual desktops (I have six: one for
system administration, one for mail/news/other comms, three for my three
most important projects, and one extra), and a per-desktop FvwmIconMan
(which I wish was included in the standard distribution).  The FvwmIconMan
is really nice for finding a window among many.  That and automatic
raising of the focused window are about the most important work boosters 
from Fvwm (fiddling around with my .fvwm2rc is not :-).  Oh, the built-in
window list is also nice, since it allows me to go directly to a window
on another desktop.

I'm not really a power user (I prefer "wannabe hacker"), so at the moment,
after two nights of using mostly e-mail, I only have 22 windows spread
on my desktops (one of them is completely empty).  I can easily have more
than three times that, but usually I avoid it since the built-in window
list no longer fits on my screen (I usually close all editor windows
for one project when I stop working it for the day).

My work habits tend to encourage many windows -- I have xfm configured so
that it starts an editor when a file is double clicked, and a typical
project has a dozen or two files, most of which are edited or viewed
at the same time.  Also my editor (my own; one of my projects :-) makes
it trivial to `clone' a window, i.e., to open a new window with the same
file and the same location as the old one (the cloning is done by a single
click -- no menus or anything).  After trying many alternatives, this is
what I've landed on.

It could be improved.  I'd like a Windows-like Alt-Tab and Alt-Shift-Tab
that circulate among windows, but re-order the list (or stack) so that the 
new window is always brought to the top.  This'd make it easier to
navigate without a mouse.  Oh, and an optional status window would
probably be preferable than directly jumping to the window; I don't know.

(I don't like Windows as a whole, but it has some nice points in its
user interface.)

Personally, I prefer

	Style "*"           BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 2, NoHandles

I used the borders only when resizing, and that's not common enough an
operation for me that I can't go select it from a menu.

I no longer need an answer to this question, as I've gone back to the
original method I used: just wait for fvwm to tell the program what its
location is. This seems to work, but I don't remember why I stopped doing
it that way. 

For those who are curious about such things, I tried the obvious method
arising from what I described below, just call XGetGeometry on the frame
window and then compute the new location, and I believe I ended up with a race
condition if I was moving between pages while the manager was resizing itself
(which is often since it always resizes itself when you change pages), and it
didn't work.

How do I go about changing the label on an existing xterm titlebar
from within that xterm?
I'm running 2.0p38


Also, does anybody know if its possible to change the code that
does the titlebar labeling to accept the mwm commands.
I ask because the application that we primarily run here is 
cadence. Cadence will update the mwm titlebar if you push down into the
hierarchy of the layout to match the cell that is currently being
edited.

The standard way of dealing with this independantly of window manager
is to call XQueryTree repeatedly until you get to the root window.
(This is according to ICCCM I believe).
There are two problems with this though.
    1) It is very inefficient because it requires a round trip to the
X server for each level of window above the shell widget.
    2) It doesn't necessarily work for situations where the root
window has been superceded.  Is it vroot that does this ?

The solution to (1) is to only do the XQueryTree process when you get
the XReparentEvent, and store the top-most window id somewhere.

The solution to (2) is to include vroot.h (is that it ?) which will
allow you to work out the id of the pseudo-root.  The problem is, what
if there are multiple implementations of this pseudo-root concept ?

Hope that helps,
    Jonathan.

You need to use xterm escape sequences (listed in a file called ctlseqs.ms
which comes with the xterm distribution). For bash I do something like the
following in my shell startup file:

	IDNAME="`whoami`"
	ESC="\033"
	TITLESTRING="\[${ESC}]0;${IDNAME}@\h\]"

	PS1="${TITLESTRING}\\$ "

This puts the string "username@machine_name" into the title bar. Putting
the escapes in my prompt means it is updated on rlogins, etc.

What do you mean MWM commands to change the titlebar?  If the program
uses standard methods for changing the window name, the titlebar
should be updated correctly.

Unfortunately I don't have a copy of Cadence, so I can't test this.
But as I said above, it should work.  Use FvwmIdent to see if the
window name is changing correctly even if the titlebar isn't.

Thanks for all the help to my question.

FvwmIndent shows me that the titlebar name doesn't change after
running the xterm command.
If I restart fvwm, the title bar changes, and FvwmIdent shows
the same change.

I'll load 2.0.40 this weekend to see if its my version "2.0.38"
thats causing the problem.

To change the titlebar or icon, echo one of the following strings within
the xterm in question:


"{ESC}]0;<text>{CTRL-G}"      -  Changes the Icon Name and Titlebar
"{ESC}]1;<text>{CTRL-G}"      -  Changes the Icon Name ONLY
"{ESC}]2;<text>{CTRL-G}"      -  Changes the Titlebar ONLY


Of course, {ESC} is the control character, \033 or Control-V then ESC, and
{CTRL-G} is Control-V then Control-G.

This is on HPUX.

The first problem is the order of the libaries when compiling fvwm2. 
On my machine at least, -lfvwm2 needs to come before the X libs, as it
uses XLoadQueryFont, which is defined in X11. Currently, it's the last library
in the list.

Secondly, the macro FVWM_CPP, which is used by FvwmCpp to determine where
cpp is, can be set in makefile.h, but there doesn't seem to be an automatic
way for imake to generate a -DFVWM_CPP="whatever" line in FvwmCpp's makefile.

Known problem.  Patch can be found at:

Correct.  The build process is still being improved, so for the time
being just edit makefile.h.  I'll try and account for this in the
future.

  Back in 1.xx we had FvwmPagerDeskTopScale.  At 2.00 this disappeared and
  was re-introduced at 2.36.  Either the re-introduction doesn't simulate
  the old behavior, or I can't get it to do what I want.  I believe that
  back in 1.xx the DeskTopScale was actually a "PageScale", and not a
  "DeskScale" as it seems to be now.

  I use a 8x1 desktop.  My screen resolution is 1248x1024.  My pager is
  usually iconized and I have it at the bottom right of the screen.  I
  would like it to be about 60 pixels high, which would be about 585 pixels
  wide.  This is very close to a desk top scale of 17.

  Back in 1.xx I only specified position part of the pager geometry and a
  scale, and that's all I had to do.  I can't seem to make it work for 2.xx
  using scale alone.  The way that it is coded now it only seems to work
  for NxN desktops.

I noticed these problems in the scaled size calculation a few weeks

Hi Chuck, 

	I've been talking to Rob Nation, and he informed me
that you are now doing the fvwm 2.x developpement. Anyways, to make
a long story short, I've been working with Holger Veit on an OS/2 port
of Xfree86. The port is going well, most of the clients run and the 
server is now running (at least on my computer...). My contribution
up to now has been with the servers. 

Anyways, twm from the standard X11R6 dist. runs fine. I personally prefer
fvwm, its smaller, faster, and more functional(its what I have on linux).
 I hacked the 1.24(?) source
the other night, got it to compile and run under OS/2. Good. But
I also realised that a new version of fvwm was being worked on, and so I 
figured that if I was to make this a usefull port, I should work on the 2.x
version. 

Anyways, Rob told me that the new version was pretty well done and being
tested now. What I wondered was wether:

1. An OS/2 port would be welcome (I know it would'nt be hard, it took me
a night to do a "dirty" port of 1.24)

2. Would you include the source changes in you code base. These changes 
would obviously be "non-intrusive", in the sense that all OS/2 changes
would be enclosed in #ifdefs statements (like for Xfree86).

Anyways, let me know how you feel about this.

Thanks,

Hello,

Is there an easy way to set up keys to take me directly to a mapped
desktop without having to be in the root window (or the virtual
desktop).  I used to have my 9-key numeric keypad mapped to my 3x3
virtual desktop using tvtwm (running Solaris 2.5), and it was nice
not having to move my pointer off my active windows before using 
navigating with the keypad (like with olvwm).   Any suggestions
are greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Jim

That's pretty damn snazzy, if I do say so myself.  I liked that one
enough to figure out how to do it... :-)

In my .fvwm2rc, I put:
#    Key name    Context    Modifiers   Action
#    ---------   -------    ---------   ------------
Key KP_Home       A           N        GoToPage 0 0
Key KP_Up         A           N        GoToPage 1 0
Key KP_Prior      A           N        GoToPage 2 0
Key KP_Left       A           N        GoToPage 0 1
Key KP_Begin      A           N        GoToPage 1 1

etc.  This works for me, on an SGI... you might need to change the key names
but other than that it should work.

I map my numeric keypad to a 3x3 virtual desktop like this:

Key KP_1        A       A       GotoPage 0 2
Key KP_2        A       A       GotoPage 1 2
Key KP_3        A       A       GotoPage 2 2
Key KP_4        A       A       GotoPage 0 1
Key KP_5        A       A       GotoPage 1 1
Key KP_6        A       A       GotoPage 2 1
Key KP_7        A       A       GotoPage 0 0
Key KP_8        A       A       GotoPage 1 0
Key KP_9        A       A       GotoPage 2 0

A is "any", N is "none".  These affect whether or not shift, control,
and meta change the key binding.  If you use "A" then, for example,
<shift>+(whatever) will have the same effect as (whatever) by itself.

You can also specifically refer to:
 S shift
 M meta
 C control
RTFM on fvwm for more info; look for the section on "Key" and "Mouse"
bindings.

Is there a way to change the viewport in the virtual window with a mouse drag
op0eration (similar to the way a window is moved)?  I have many windows that are
larget than the screen on my laptop (600x800) and would like to move around
without hitting the borders or jumping with dedicated keys.

thanks

Unless someone has done some serious hacking with fvwm to overcome what
I think are limitations in X11, I'm not sure what I'm about to ask is
possible.

But, what the heck, maybe this is just the group to ask.

We have several people here who would like to use two (or more) physical
monitors as the same display.  In other words, monitor one would be
pixels 0,0-1023,767 of DISPLAY 0.0 and monitor two would be pixels
1024,0-2048,767 of the _same_ display.  Windows could be partially
visible across each monitor and dragged or resized across them.

Does anyone know how to do this (short of buying a Macintosh)?

Thanks,
--john

If you're talking about Sun's, you may be lucky.

I've never investigated it, but there's a modified X11R6 server available
in the R6 contrib tree called Xvan.  Here's the top of the README:

        README file for Xvan 1.2 (X11/R6 multiple screen server)
        Peter C. Jones, Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Chelmsford, MA
        last updated June 1995

  This is the README file for the X11/R6 version of the Xvan server.
  This latest release features a couple of bug fixes and the necessary
  updates to remain consistent with patch level 11 of the X11/R6
  distribution.

  Xvan is a modification of the X11/R6 sample server that allows
  multiple physical screens to comprise one logical screen.  It is
  currently only fully implemented for Sun workstations, so there is
  only one machine-specific subdirectory, "sun", in the "hw" branch of
  the source tree.  However, for any other machine that could use the
  code in the standard "mfb" and "cfb*" directories, it should be rather
  simple to port Xvan functionality.

If my reading of this is correct, fvwm (or any window manager) running on top
of this will think that there's only one screen and will do just what you want.

Alternately (found this by looking in the tcsh man page.  Guess what?  It
explains on how to do the very question asked...):

   if ($term == xterm) then
	alias cwdcmd 'echo -n "\033]2;${HOST}:$cwd\007\033]1;${HOST}\007"'
   endif

I couldn't get ^[ to work, but escaping works for me.  What's cwdcmd? 

<snip>

       Tcsh now supports a special alias, cwdcmd,  which  if  set
       holds  a  command that will be executed after changing the
       value of $cwd.  For example, if the user is running on  an
       X  window  system xterm(1), and a re-parenting window man-
       ager that supports title bars such as twm(1) and has done:

             > alias cwdcmd  'echo -n "^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd ^G"'

       then  the  shell  will  change  the  title  of the running
       xterm(1) to be the name of the host, a colon, and the full
       current  working  directory.

We have been using Xvan and Fvwm 1.x under SunOs 4.1.3 for almost 2 years now.
The workstation has two monitors and yes you can drag the windows between the
two physical monitors. Performance of the XVan Xserver is not so great and it
tends to grow after long usage. It it slightly instable causing us to reboot
the machines every couple of months if you have many windows open (sy > 50)
that are update intensive.
We love using it here because it is great for programming (you can see your
debugger, app. editor etc all at once) and also for an applicatin we have that
has big screens and a number of them that we want to be able to see at the same
time.
Your mileage may vary under Solaris 2.x and Fvwm 2.x.

I have seen a number of commercial offerings but we are not willing to pay $$$$
per license per Server. XVan does it's job well, definitely worth looking at.

There are some people on the FVWM mailing list that have, I believe.
Anyone out there who can help Shirjeet?

I do have access to some HP (UX 9) machines here, but they've been
pretty flaky lately and I haven't tried to compile fvwm on them.  If I
get a chance some day I will, just for grins.

I compiled 1.24r under hpux 9.01 for PA-RISC (700s) machines awhile ago.
I had trouble compiling for the old 68040 machines (425s).  (This was
a gcc problem though...)

I don't remember having to do anything special.  I might have the tarball
laying around, but I make no guarantees about what I modified.  (I'm
also no longer the official admin of those HP machines)

For VMS on the other hand I luckily found a patched version from
someone in Japan... (It was an older version so I updated it to 1.24r) :)

Is anyone working on VMS support for 2.x???

The "faces" program (available at ftp.cs.indiana.edu in pub/faces; not
to be confused with "xfaces") can be used to monitor mail, logins,
printer queues, etc.  I use it as a replacement for xbiff; it shows a
face or domain logo for each mail message.

Unfortunately, the program tickles a serious bug in fvwm.  Initially
after starting faces, there is no problem.  After a minute, faces makes
its first check for new mail and does an update.  At this point fvwm
starts expanding rapidly in memory, the machine starts thrashing, and
it's a race to see if I can kill the process before all swap space is
consumed and my machine crashes.

I noticed this bug under fvwm-1, so I upgraded to version 2.0.40, where
it still occurs.  I'm running under XFree86 3.1.2B, on Linux 1.2.13
(Debian 1.0 Alpha).  I compiled fvwm with gcc and used Xpm.

The faces program itself is well-used and tested.  The most recent version
dates back to 1991, and it compiles easily out of the box (just be sure
to use the -traditional flag).  The window system code is relatively
small and isolated into a file x11.c (faces runs under several different
window systems).

I'd be happy to supply further information if anybody has ideas or
questions.  

Thanks,
Fritz Knabe

  I've been using and compiling fvwm on HP-UX since version 0.99
  something.  I've always used HP's C compiler and make.  I can't remember
  when was the last time it didn't compile out of the box.

Hi,

I'm currently using fvwm 1.24r under Solaris 2.4.
Sometimes (supposed to be after a long period) when 
clicking in the FvwmPager, that makes the X server crash...

Has somebody a clue about this buggy behaviour? 
Is there any known patch for fvwm 1.24r under Solaris?

Thanx in advance,

Desc...

I am using the programm "xfaces" which does about the same job as faces
as you described it. (I can't remember where I got it from ...)
It dates back to 1993, so I suppose its well tested, too.

This bug does not occur with xfaces, it compiled out of the box and
runs smooth ever since ...

I'm using fvwm 2.0.38 / XFree 3.1.2 Linux 1.2.13 everything compiled on
an ELF system.

I hope this helps (unless you are forced to use "faces" instead of
"xfaces")

What do you do for imake?

My HPUX 9.03 doesn't have it, I had to install X11R5. Is this normal for
HPUX?

Thanx guys , and specially Mike and Henrique ..the problem has now 
been fixed ...

The problem was , I was using gmake and gmake seems to be broken in 
our installation ..

I used HP make and Gcc , and it now compiles and runs fine ..

Ok, this is nontechnical question on FVWM but I am seeking help on
how to get FVWM up and running on a SparcStation 4 with Solaris 2.4
that had a base configuration (fresh off the CDRom).

I am having trouble compiling the Xpm library. The process of xmkmf
does not seem to set up the Makefiles right. It keeps trying to use
cc. I checked site.def and sun.cf for the xmkmf bu quickly realized 
that I didn't know what I needed to change. Should I set something
like "HasGcc" in these files. One thing that clued me in on this was
that the compile kept trying to use -xF with gcc (I went into the
Makefile and changed it by hand). This option is set for cases when gcc
is not on the system. 

About the system:

Solaris 2.4 basic installation running openwindows and olwm(yuk!)

No cc compiler shipped with OS. I installed gcc-2.7.1 by copying it from
and identical machine. (That happened because gcc needs a compiler to
build itself and I didn't have one). 

Xpm not on the machine but I have thae package and have unsuccessfully
tried installation. The commands that are given for installation
in the Xpm distribution result in errors given here. Could someone help
me out and point me to a good resource on this. Anyone that has done the
procedure I am attempting would be great.

Thanks,
Chris Penland

I've seen this question asked before and it always seems the answer is
"one can't".  Sure enough, if I set *FvwmPagerStartIconic, FvwmButtons
won't swallow it until I deiconify it.  However I'm a stubborn old
cuss so today being a slow Friday and all, I thought about it some and
came up with an ugly hack that works.  It occurred to me that while I
couldn't have FvwmButtons directly swallow an icon, I could have it
swallow an FvwmIconBox.  So I made a symlink to FvwmIconBox called
FvwmPagerBox (wouldn't it be nice if all modules worked like FvwmForm
so we could dispense with the symlinks, hint hint :-) and set it up so
it would only display the FvwmPager and then had FvwmButtons swallow
an FvwmPagerBox.  It means I have to start an FvwmPager anytime I run
FvwmButtons, but that's not so bad.  Here's the relevant .fvwm2rc
lines with a bit of commentary thrown in:

# I prefer a multipage desktop so I can use edgescrolling

  Imake used to be available on a HP ftp server accessible from the
  "outside" (hpcvaaz.cv.hp.com).  The current imake I have, may or not have
  been obtained there, as I've installed a few different versions from a
  few different (HP) places, some that work on my system, some that don't,
  that I've lost track.

  Same goes for Xaw and Xmu, which along with imake, HP doesn't ship on
  9.0x, and rather points to public sites.  This may have changed at 10.x,
  but I'm not sure what the "official line" is.  A good place to get HP-UX
  stuff is at the archives maintained by the University of Liverpool, which
  are mirrored at the University of Wisconsin, and a few other places,
  http://hpux.cae.wisc.edu, http://hpux.csc.liv.ac.uk, etc.

  X11R5 development is probably an optional product, as is the "real C"
  compiler, for example.  X11R5 run time libraries is probably part of the
  core HP-UX, as is the brain dead C compiler used to regen the kernel.

If you don't mind, I'd like to put your response for this problem in
the FAQ.  Other people in the past have had the same problem, so it's
probably not a bad idea...

Hello all,

As some people on this list have graciously added links from their web pages 
to mine, I wanted to let those page masters know that my internet provider has 
moved things around, and thus the address for Eric Kahler's Fvwm web page is 
slightly different.  The old address was http://mars.superlink.net/user/ekahler
/fvwm.html, and is now:


	http://mars.superlink.net/ekahler/fvwm.html


I'd appreciate it if those of you whom I'm trying to reach would update your 
links.  Apparently accessing the old address works for the moment, but I'm not 
sure if it will indefinately.

Thank you.

Eric Kahler.

Thanks again to everyone's help for the title bar. 
The updating became automatic as soon as started running 2.0.40.

The 2.0.40 compile on SunOS 4.1.4 with gcc 2.6.3 worked
without a single problem. Thanks to all the code writers.

I've just noticed something strange, my key bindings to jump between screens
doesn't work after I restart fvwm! (fvwm-2-4.0, on a Solaris 2.4 machine).


My (rather short) list of bindings looks thusly:
Key Left        R       N       Scroll -100 0
Key Right       R       N       Scroll 100 0
Key Up          R       N       Scroll 0 -100
Key Down        R       N       Scroll 0 100
Key q           FITDWS     M       Close
Key q           FITDWS     M3      Close
Key w           FITDWS     M       Iconify 
Key w           FITDWS     M3      Iconify
Mouse 1 R       A       Menu Utilities Nop
Mouse 2 R       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 3 R       A       WindowList
Mouse 0 1       A       Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse 0 2       A       Maximize
Mouse 0 4       A       Iconify

The <>-Q and <>-W etc all work fine, its just my arrow keys that are
rendered impotent by a restart. Any ideas?

 . . . And no, I'm not talking about giving it more bugs and making it
slower.  One feature I do miss about Microsoft's poor excuse for an OS
is the kewl way to switch between the most recently-viewed window and
the current one by holding down Alt and continually pressing Tab.
Sure I've put

Key Tab         A       M       CirculateDown

in my .fvwmrc, but it just isn't the same (you Microsoft users know
what I'm talking about).  Any ideas on implementing this feature in fvwm?

Hi,

I have a problem when I am trying to install fvwm-2.0.40 on my PC
running
Debian 0.93R6. I modified configure.h to my liking (just the variables
telling where to install various things) and then I did what is
said in the INSTALL file to build and install fvwm:

# xmkmf
# make Makefiles
# make 
# make install
...
rm -f fvwm2

I also ran into this problem while compiling fvwm for OS/2. This is
due to the fact that the X libraries are being linked before the
fvwm.a lib, which contains a reference to the X libs. My solution was
simply to change this line in makefile.h:

LOCAL_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES $(ADD_LIB) $(XLIB) \
$(FVWM_SRCDIR)/libs/$(LIB).a
 
to: 

LOCAL_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES $(ADD_LIB)
$(FVWM_SRCDIR)/libs/$(LIB).a \ $(XLIB)

Maybe this should be changed permanently in makefile.h?

Hi,

I am pretty new to fvwm (and the list).  I have been 
using 1.? for a month or so on a Sparc20.  My question 
is concerning the setup of GoodStuff.  Is there a way
to control where each button will appear in GoodStuff?
It seems to be kind of random.  I would like to simulate
the cde/hp style button bar a little better.  For 
example, is there a way to make 3 rows, of different 
sizes?  I'd like to have a small row with buttons for
screen lock, logout, etc.

Also, on a somewhat related issue.  Is there a clock
program that has a compact digital face?  I am using
the Openwindows clock (swallowed into GoodStuff), but
it is a little to big.

Thanks,
Kevin

Is there a way (under fvwm2) to use a menu with the FvwmButtons module?
The man page says any built-in command should work, so I tried both

*FvwmButtons	-	whatever	Menu "Test" Nop

and

*FvwmButtons	-	whatever	PopUp "Test

(this is from memory, so the syntax may not be totally correct.  It is in
the .fvwm file, though).  Obviosuly, it didn't work.

I couldn't find an answer to this in any FAQ or info file I saw.

Is it just not possible to do this?  I think this would be really
useful if it could be done.

Thanks for any help!

The following works for me:

*FvwmButtons Machines	xftp.xpm	Popup Rlogins

This pops up the menu on clicking the button.

I just uploaded FvwmIconMan 0.3 onto hpc.uh.edu. Gauging from last time,
an announcement should appear here when it's moved into its final resting
place. As always, you can also get it from:

ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan-0.3.tar.gz

Mahler is the machine on my desk, so it's there right now.

Changes:

* It now correctly keeps the manager lists sorted when windows change names.
* Added an option: sort, to control whether or not to sort.
* Added an option: followfocus, when set the manager will keep track of
	which window has the focus.
* You can customize the look of buttons in the following states: the window
	has focus, the cursor is in the button, the cursor is in the
	button AND the window has focus, and plain buttons. For each
	state you can specify the foreground and background color, and whether
	the button looks raised, flat, or sunk. I use the same color scheme
	as my titlebars, and it's a big improvement.
* It has an Imakefile. No more config.h junk unless you want/have to. (you
	still need to set FVWM_VERSION appropriately, but it defaults to
	2 now).
* Added an action for when the cursor enters a window's button, and you
	can bind fvwm events to it. 
* Up to know you could only set a window's manager based on the value of
	its Resource. Now you can use regular expressions, and match against
	the icon, title, class, and resource of a window. Matching against the
	title or icon name can result in you window moving from one manager to
	another. 
* I include a patch to fvwm 2.0.40 to modify the Focus function so that you
	can bind Focus to the above action, and get it to work like the
	TWM icon manager.
* Fixed some bugs, and probably introduced more. 


I'd like to thank David Berson (berson@cs.pitt.edu) and Ricardo Gonsalez
(ricardog@obelix.stanford.edu) for their code donations.

Enjoy.

My original posting was:

---------

Hi,

I have a problem when I am trying to install fvwm-2.0.40 on my PC
running
Debian 0.93R6. I modified configure.h to my liking (just the variables
telling where to install various things) and then I did what is
said in the INSTALL file to build and install fvwm:

# xmkmf
# make Makefiles
# make 
# make install
...
rm -f fvwm2
gcc -o fvwm2 -O2 -m486 -ansi     -L/usr/X11R6/lib add_window.o
bindings.o      borders.o       builtins.o      colormaps.o
colors.o    complex.o       decorations.o   events.o        focus.o
    functions.o     fvwm.o  icons.o         menus.o         misc.o
module.o        move.o  placement.o     read.o  resize.o
style.o         virtual.o       windows.o -lXpm  -lXExExt -lXext -lX11
/libs/libfvwm2.a      
GetFont.o(.text+0x8f): undefined reference to `XLoadQueryFont'
GetFont.o(.text+0xb3): undefined reference to `XLoadQueryFont'
make[1]: *** [fvwm2] Error 1
...
#

Can somebody help me and tell why `XLoadQueryFont' is undefined and
what I should do to fix the problem? Please send me email
directly and I will summarize the answers...

-----------

I immediately got two replies, from

Richard Kaszeta <kaszeta@me.umn.edu> and from
Sebastien Marineau <marineau@genie.uottawa.ca>

both of them telling me what the problem is and how to fix it. Here is
Sebastiens advice:

 > I also ran into this problem while compiling fvwm for OS/2. This is

I did this and re-made fvwm from scratch and it worked just fine!

Subject: FVWM: fvwmform problem under solaris
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

hi, i compiled 2.0.40 under both aix 2.3 and solaris
(sunos 5.5). i have some macros in my rc file that
use the FvwmForm (e.g. QuitVerify).

it turns out that macros using FvwmForm do not work
under solaris and work perfectly well in aix.

i tried a number of different things:

	redirect stdout to some place visible
	invoke FvwmForm QuitVerify from the Talk module
	add Module FvwmDebug at the top of the rc file
	link QuitVerify to FvwmForm in the modules directory

and none of them makes it work or produce any error whatsoever;
it just gets ignored. when i run FvwmForm from the command
line it does not produce any output (in solaris or aix).
(most of) the rest of the modules produce some error
and they work fine in both operating systems.

is this a known bug in FvwmForm under solaris?
any ideas how to proceed?

thanks in advance,

Mmm, just a quick note to say that I have no problems running QuitVerify
(as given from the man page) under Solaris 2.4 (fvwm 2.0.40)
Erm...I dunno why you're having problems.
Sorry I can't be more help really!

Perhaps unlikely, but I got bit by it so I'll ask: Do you have a call
to xmodmap in your init/restart functions?  If so, get it out of the
restart function.  Some of the xmodmap mappings can end up acting like
toggles which might mess up your arrow keys or modifiers.  I got bit
by this once.  If I restarted fvwm the swapping of CONTROL and
CAPSLOCK got switched back and my mapping for MOD2 got lost.  I've
sinced put the call to xmodmap directly in my .xsession file.

Nope. This isn't what happens.

A bit of experimenting reveals that xlock does the same thing.
On unlocking my machine I have to give the focus to a window and then
I can go back to root and use my arrow keys to navigate pages.

Inconvenient if I restart or unlock and want to go to screen X.

Another one for 'Why does it do that?' list then.

Currently no way to do that.  I do have a patch that might help, that
someone submitted long ago, but I don't think that it ever got
incorporated, although improvements like this for FvwmButtons are on
my 2.xx TO-DO list.  I've included this patch below.  No guarantees.

How about the stock X11 xclock?  It looks just fine in a
GoodStuff/FvwmButtons bar, I think.

Hi,
Here is the patch to modify GoodStuff.c
Usage:      patch GoodStuff.c < diff

It was written for the GoodStuff packed with fvwm 1.24n,
but I think nothing much has changed

Now you can specifie the ButtonLines in your .fvwmrc
and they will appear as button in the expected order.
But be warned, if you write Nonsens you will get Nonsens back
(e.g.
*GoodStuffColumns 3
*GoodStuff(2x2) ....
*GoodStuff(2x2) ....
.... is wrong because you have defined two buttons which will be placed
in the same row now. But rows have only 3 colums NOT 4
hope you understand what I try to say ;-)

Rob ask me whether it will handle all possible combinations
of oversized buttons.
The answer is: I don know, but it should.

I use it for the following ButtonBar:

 _________                             ______________
|_A__|_B__|   or something like that: |_A__|_B__|_C__|
|_C__|_D__|                           |_D__|_E__|_F__|
|    |_F__|                           |    |    |    |
|_E__|_G__|                           |    |_H__|_I__|
|    |_I__|                           |_G__|_J_______|
|_H__|_J__|                           |         |    |
|    |_L__|                           |         |_L__|
|_K__|_M__|                           |         |    |
|         |                           |_K_______|_M__|
|         |                           |         |    |
|_N_______|                           |         |_O__|
|         |                           |         |    |
|         |                           |_N_______|_P__|
|_O_______|                           |         |    |
|         |                           |         |_R__|
|         |                           |         |    |
|_P_______|                           |_Q_______|_S__|

This is not tested, but it shoul work too:
 ________________________
|_A__|    |_C__|    |_E__|
|_F__|    |_G__|    |_H__|
|_I__|_B__|_J__|_D__|_K__|
|_L_______|_M_______|_N__|

The LETTERS show the order of the buttons you should define in
the .fwvmrc

If there's a configuration which won't work, please feel free to
send me your problem. But please keep in mind, that it's on your own
to define the button well_sized (They should fit always the defined
Rows or Colums) and Position (always the leftmost && topmost free
position - on the grid - is used for the next button)
(be sure that there is enough room!!)

If You use simple 1x1 buttons, this patch will not take in effect.

One fellow was wondering about binding a mouse event to a popup menu
in FvwmIconMan, so I tried it. I bound my WindowOps popup to a mouse
click (that menuu has the standard raise, lower, etc in it). The popup
works fine, so I selected lower. I figured it wouldn't lower the correct
window, but I didn't expect the core dump that happened. Here's the deal:

UpdateMenu() calls ExecuteFunction() and passes a NULL window pointer.
This NULL pointer winds up as the paramater to LowerWindow(), and
LowerWindow() immediately dereferences it. 

I don't know what the preferred method to deal with this is. Perhaps all 
of the low level LowerWindow() type functions need to check for NULL, or
maybe the check should be done higher up. I don't know.

Hi,

I just upgraded 2 machines to 2.0.40 and found that my m4 style .fvwmrc
files failed to work correctly.  The basic problem is that certain
options/styles fail to get set.  It also appears to be pseudo-random in
nature, 3 different starts have 3 different results.

Setting DBUG in configure.h I observed that fvwm starts FvwmM4 and then goes
on to do various X11 initializations, finally entering it's HandleEvents loop.
By the time FvwmM4/m4 have processed .fvwm2rc into /tmp/fvwmrcxxxxxx and
returned the SendInfo( "read /tmp/fvwmrcxxxx" ) message MANY X events have
been handled.  I am not an X11 programer, so I have NO idea where the exact
problem is.  My first observation was that placing a "sleep 15" into .xinitrc
immediately after starting fvwm2rc would fix the problem (usually).  So I went
fishing for a way to syncronize fvwm2 and FvwmM4.  The result is the following
set of patches to fvwm/fvwm.c:

I also found a bug in FvwmM4 itself, if you don't set '-debug' when invoking
fvwm2rc, FvwmM4 removes /tmp/fvwmrcxxxxxx when it finishes.  This means that 
any
modules started interactively (eg. via pulldown menues) are given the now non-
existant file's name as it's expected config file.

Both of these will install from the top level directory via:

% patch -p < patch-aa; patch -p < patch-ab

Note that the first patch to fvwm.c is quite GROSS, but it does work.  Perhaps
it will create insite for a more X literate programmer to find a correct
solution.  I have NOT attempted to use these patches with cpp, and am just
assumming that the same problem might exist.  So look expecially hard at them
b4 using with FvwmCpp.

i swallow xdaliclock into my FvwmButtons with the following:

note you can set the font to whatever you like, so it can be as compact
as you want...

i'm not *exactly* sure what you're asking, but what i do is bind
FvwmWinList to mouse button 3 on the root window like this:

Mouse 3         R       A       Module FvwmWinList transient

this pops up the window list when i click with button 3 on the root
window, and closes it when i let go of the button (either by selecting a
window, or not...)

Hello all! I've just been sitting here all evening playing with fvwm, happened
to discover the trick with pixmaps in menus :-) Looks absolutely gorgeous!
I've been drawing colorful colormapfriendly 16x16 icons for 4 hours :-)

However there are a few features I'd like to see in some modules. (Real small
ones, no need to get preachy about the Featherweight Virtual Window Manager)

FvwmButtons:
* Would it be tricky to enhance FvwmButtons to accept the fontname "None" and
then go without fonts? Like the Pager module? Currently I _almost_ get there
by using "-misc-nil-*", gives just a 2 pixel overhead, but it's kinda cheating.
* I can't believe noone has noticed that FvwmButtons is squeezed into a window
that's one pixel too small both ways! I'm using it without any frame, and it's
painfully obvious that the right and bottom edge borders are 1 pixel wide,
while all the other borders are 2 pixels. Is this a bug or a feature?
* While playing around with the configuration, I sometimes want to "split
a button in two", however, after modifying all the other buttons to have
sizes like (1x2), and restarting, all these other buttons have grown by 
4 pixels (for the frame), 2 pixels for padding, and 2 times the height of
the font used. Aaaagh. It looks bad. Oh well, just throw in into the "more
control of FvwmButtons geometry. I almost can't stop myself hacking at the
code myself. Just wanted to see if anyone else is doing something. :-)

FvwmIconBox: (Is this obsoleted by FvwmIconMan or what?)
* Same as for FvwmButtons, I'd like to be able to turn off IconTitles by 
setting the font to "none". 
* Make it possible to set the width of all those bars all over the place.
I'd just like to get them away, set them to 0 or something, and swallow it
all in the Buttons. 
* If we want it in the Buttons it should be able to take all sizes, why not
just let it pad off the icon-area inside? 
* I notice non-transparent icons get a 3D-frame, but not transparent ones..
Should be possible to this with something akin to ..IconFrame True|False|Guess

Now that's nice, seems I've reached the end of my complaints. Oh yeah, add
the usual Ay's for strict colormap negotiation and an FvwmButtons that doesn't
die with it's children.

Btw, are there any compos for best-looking configuration of fvwm out there :-)
Count me in.

Vyrsdsamt,
-Jarl

I do tend to do that every now and then, but module enhancements I
don't normally have problems with (at least not about size).

I don't think it would be too bad.  Go ahead and do it. :)
I'll add it to my TO-DO list.

I never noticed it, but then again I don't use FvwmButtons.  So, I
just tried it.  I removed the frame entirely and I see no extra space
around it, so this may be a bug on your system only.  This might
explain why no one else saw it.

This may be related to your above problem.

If you feel the urge, go ahead and hack at the code.  You might want
to look at the TO-DO list and see if you'd like any of those
additional features or bugs fixed and take a stab at them.

jarl> FvwmIconBox: (Is this obsoleted by FvwmIconMan or what?)

Nope.

jarl> * Same as for FvwmButtons, I'd like to be able to turn off

Same answer as above.

jarl> * Make it possible to set the width of all those bars all over

What bars are you referring to?  Since I don't usually use it, I may
be showing my ignorance here.

jarl> * If we want it in the Buttons it should be able to take all
jarl> sizes, why not just let it pad off the icon-area inside?

I'm not sure I understand what you're asking for here.  But I can't
really see anyone wanting FvwmButtons to swallow FvwmIconBox.  It's a
little big for that, don't you think?

jarl> * I notice non-transparent icons get a 3D-frame, but not

If you compiled with the SHAPE option, this happens.

Hmm, this sounds strange. I've played some more with it (both on SunOS and
Linux) and the problem remains: On the rightmost and bottom buttons the
2-pixel wide "3D-frame" is truncated to 1 pixel, always. As if the mapped
window is 1 pixel to small both ways. 
This is 2.0.38 and though I believe nothing's changed I'll see if it gets
better when I compile 2.0.40.

I didn't know what to call it, but it's the... background, or rather the
hardcoded _framework_ (that's it) which is way to dominant for my tender
layout :-)

Not really. I'm using 16x16 icons for this, and an icon in my buttonbar is
64x38, som when I let the FvwmIconBox be 4 buttons wide, it easily fits
atleast 16 icons and a scrollbar, with a total geometry of 286x42.
Provided I get rid of those titles. I'll look to it if I have success 
hacking the buttonbar.

Thanks for the feedback,
-Jarl

Hi all,

Don't really know if this is an fvwm or xfaces question, but since
I've had no luck with the xfaces crowd, I thought I'd try here.

I've compiled xfaces (most recent version -- 3.3?) under HP-UX 700
series and am running it with fvwm2.0pl39.

Any image or annotation that touches the left edge of its cell has a
small white space (2-3 pixels) and the image/annotation gets pushed
off the right edge (clipped).  This is kinda annoying since it makes the
annotation unreadable in a lot of cases (i.e. the message count).

Has anyone seen/fixed this?

Thanks for any tips/pointers you can provide!

Regards,

Bret

Umm, is it morning yet? Seems I've been sitting up all night patching up this
silly little program. At least something is still working, tho.
Actually I have some fixes and some features. I don't know if anybody other
than me have ever noticed those bugs, but if you have tried to make a compact
buttonbar with lots of pixmaps and no text you should have. Oh well, why do
I bother; here's the list of actual patches:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
 * Seems the code was deliberately designed to only allow window sizes 1x1 
   pixel too small to contain the buttons. Either that or there is some server
   dependancy that has to be sorted out. Anyway, it's fixed now. If it turns
   out it's for the worse for you, scream.

 * Buttonheight was calculated as the highest pixmap + fontheight, without 
   checking if the highest pixmap actually had a title. This is now fixed.


New Features:
 * To effectively avoid any titles, you can now set the font to "none", i.e.

     *FvwmButtonsFont None

 * The padding between the interior and the 3D frame used to be hardcoded to
   2 pixels horizontally and 3 vertically. This can now be adjusted with

     *FvwmButtonsPadding PadX [PadY]

   If PadY is not given, it is assumed equal to PadX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is what I've done. If anyone wants it mail me and I'll send the whole
source (FvwmButtons.c and icons.c), I don't know how to make a patchfile, and
I'm to tired to try to learn how at the moment. Also there are some other
things I want to do with it. First of all, I know there is another patch for
this thingie, it's mentioned in the TO-DO, but where can I find it? Is it
buried somewhere in the Mb's of the backlogs of this list? Or even better,
is there someone "in charge" I can send my changes to?

I set up a further to-do list for FvwmButtons, reads as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO:
 * Update the man page.

 * There seems to be some minor inaccuracies in the centering of swallowed
   windows that won't scale freely. After rescaling a few times the window
   typically end up in the northwest corner of its button. Minor bug.

 * For those using buttons to activate menus, it should be possible to define
   that this should happen on pushdown, not release. Will investigate.

 * Dynamically allocate structs for buttons, get away with all the usually
   wasted preallocated stuff, and also the MAX_BUTTONS constant.

 * Include old patch for multiple button combinations (?) Just found this in
   the general TO-DO list for fvwm. I'll look at it.

 * Another one from the TO-DO list, could be a difficult one, but here goes:
   Fix FvwmButtons inability to handle child program deaths.

 * And another one, must confess I didn't really understand this one:
   Add ability to FvwmButtons to swallow existing window, and to unswallow
   windows as well.

 * Maybe allow the same pixmap/text combination as in the menus?

(From here on I get kind of visionary :-) Must be lack of oxygen or maybe the
25 hrs w/o sleep...)

 * Make option for automaticly reducing colormap when loading xpm's. 

 * Make module loadable as "Module FvwmButtons MyPanel", and it will assume
   the latter name.

 * Clean out all the parser code, make it moduleindependant and put it in
   a separate file for use by other modules.

 * There really should be some interactive way to build the buttonbar :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bottom line: This patch makes the buttonbar potentially more compact (if you
want it to be), though the window is 1 by 1 pixel larger in the standard
configuration. 

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Hmm, this wasn't too difficult! Here is the patch anyway.

Cut and paste into the two files FvwmButtons.c_diff and icons.c_diff,
in the FvwmButtons directory of your favourite version of fvwm, preferably
2.0.40, then do

  patch FvwmButtons.c < FvwmButtons.c_diff
  patch icons.c < icons.c_diff
  make install

Voila! Instant upgrade :-) Comments, ideas, everything appreciated.

And a PS to Alan Wild on swallow/unswallow etc. I don't think it would be
very hard to do, I just don't see any practical application of it.. But we
might as well keep it on the list for one of those boring sleepless night :-)

the one instance i can see this as a useful feature is i'd like to be

before fvwm on my system.  right now i'm getting around this by using
fvwm as my session manager as well, but just the way our system's login
procedure works, it takes much longer for fvwm to start this way. (the
wm is loaded, then any x apps specified in a ~/.startup.X11 file, then
the session manager...)  i can't really see a use for unswallowing, but
somebody, sometime must have. :)

[Sorry if this already appeared, our mailhub appears to be dead at the moment,
I'm resending to be safe.]

Hi, I'm trying to trace a problem I have with some apps
when launched from the button bar etc (fvwm 2.0.4)

Where should I set an environment variable (say XAPPLRESDIR) in order for
FvwmButtons to pick up on it? Can it, will it? And ditto for paths.

Is there any way to get around this problem? I have some apps that run
from an xterm command line but not (properly) from FvwmButtons due
to misisng environment variables.

Any help appreciated. (Solaris 2.4, ordinary setup, a .login, a .fvwmrc,
a .tcshrc and not a lot else. Shouldn't matter much, I set my variables in
.login)

as it is now, whenever you restart fvwm all the apps in the fvwmbuttons
are closed. with swallow/unswallow they could be unswallowed before
the fvwmbuttons dies and swallowed again by the new instance of the 
module. this would speed up the restart because the time to restart 
all swalloed apps is saved.

you could also change the configuration for a single swalloed app,
unswallow, kill it and swallow the new instance of the same app. 
right now you would have to restart the whole window manager.
obviously the unswallow here becomes obsolete if fvwm would allow 
swalloed apps to die (which it doesn't right now)

If you supply a label of "-", FvwmButtons omits the label on that button,
which is more or less like having no font.

Yes, I see it too. I believe that it has always been that way.

Right now, you would only need to kill or close the button-bar, and
launch a new one. No need to restart the window manager.

Help, I'm trying to make 2.0.40 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX3.2.5 and not
having much luck.  Here are the problems I'm having, can someone please help me?

1)	Every time I run xmkmf (standalone or via MakeMakefiles) I get:
		imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/local/lib/X11/config
		line 3: cannot find include file Imake.tmpl
		imake: Exit code 2.  Stop

	I couldn't figure out to make it use the config directory we are set up to
	use, so I just replaced xmkmf with an imake command using the proper path.
	This seemed to work.

2)	When I run "make Makefiles" I get:
		make: Can't open description file "makefile".

	I try "make -f Makefile Makefiles" and get:
		Target "clean:" has multiple sets of operations
		Target "tags:" has multiple sets of operations
		make: don't know how to make "Makefiles".

3)	I modified the MakeMakefiles script to use the changes mentioned above, and
	for each directory it gives me (example show only FvwmWinList output):
		Making Makefile in modules/FvwmWinList
		Target "clean:" has multiple sets of operations
		make: don't know how to make "depend".
		done
	
Thanks, in advance for your help.

right! didn't think of that. but still it would be faster if only
the app w/ the modified configuration had to be restarted. especially
if you have a lot of apps in your fvwmbuttons.

Very easy mechanism, introduced in.. 2.0.39 or something:
If you want a pixmap above the menuitem, let the title be
   "title*pixmap.xpm*"    like  "Quit*dontpanic.xpm*"
Just forget the title if you want only the pixmap.
You can also have pixmaps to the left of the text, very win95'ish
   "title%pixmap.xpm%"    like  "Wine%smallwin.xpm%"
I've started making 16x16 icons for this, with a limited colormap.
Looks real good.

Hope this helps!

After some good hours of sleep I am back. Did some testing on the patched
FvwmButtons module, and came up with a few stupid bugs: 
1) First of all, a couple of "[i]"'s in the patch were mistyped as "[1]"'s,
   resulting in complete failure to correctly calculate buttonheight in most
   cases. 
2) The vertical padding was originally 4 pixels, not 3 as I thought. Or rather,
   it was both 3 and 4, but it turns out it was 4 where it counted :-)
   Just change the two ypad=3 with ypad=4.

Chuck:

Mmm, please tell me how they are when they're for the worse? Could be a result
of bug 1 above, of course.

I'd guess he means the incredibly wide borders built in to the box.  I
manage to get rid of them by setting FvwmIconBoxSBWidth to 0.  That
just leaves one bar where the remaining scroll bar is (since you can't
hide both scrollbars).

Hmm.  Do my posts not make it to the rest of the list?  You know some
people prefer to run the pager iconified so they always just see the
current desktop (takes up much less space that way) but get frustrated
because they can't swallow the iconfied pager?  The solution to that
is to set up the IconBox to only hold the pager icon and then swallow
that iconbox.

So that's how you can do it. However, this argues more for making
FvwmButtons be able to swallow things iconified, as swallowing the icon
manager to swallow the iconized pager is really a horrible kludge.

Yes, it is an evil kludge.  I'm going to try and get the patch to
allow the non iconified pager to show the current active desk in there
for the next release or at least before the official release.

One way is to use the "env" program, e.g.:

Hi

I have tied my "meta key F6" to the window list.  When it comes up, if I click on
a selection, that window is brought to the top and the list goes away.  When I do
the same thing, but select the entry with a numeric keystroke, two presses of the
key are required.  One to get focus? and the second to perform the task?  In
version 1.x only one keystroke was required.

What am I doing wrong? (I did use transient anter WindowList)

I was wondering if it would be possible to add an addition to the
maximize function built in to fvwm2. What I want fvwm2 to do is allow
maximization from the _bottom_ of the screen rather than the top of
the screen. I thought it might be easiest to allow negative numbers
as arguments to the Maximize function.

Another feature I wouldn't mind seeing in fvwm2 is adding a prefered 
placement area. As I tend to have all my "needed" windows at the top of the
screen, I don't want any new windows to pop up in this area. I'd like to
make this area off limits to any new windows.

I've now fixed all the bugs I introduced while hacking FvwmButtons, though
in the progress I found out there were much more to do, so I've probably
introduced some more bugs. Oh well.

FvwmButtons now has the same default behaviour as before, with the window
size fixed (no it _really_ should work always). It's also less memoryconsuming
as it now allocates dynamically the buttonstructures, instead of allocating
MAX_BUTTON of them. Now you can have an "unlimited" number of buttons.

I've juggled so much with the sources that the patch now is twice the size
of the source, so it's no use making patches. The source itself has decreased
7Kb to 45Kb. 

If anyone's interested in the current snapshot (consider it untested), you
can dl it from  http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm/ 

Comments, ideas etc welcome as usual.

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Hi!

I am using fvwm2.0.39 on an SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.3).

In my .fvwm2rc I got those lines:  (in this order)
Style "*"           SmartPlacement
Style "winterm"     ActivePlacement
Style "*Test*"      ActivePlacement
Style "*Demo*"      ActivePlacement

I expected that all windows except the last three types would
be placed "smart".  But in fact, *all* windows are placed "smart".
Is there something I didn't do right or is this a bug?

What I was trying to do is to get some windows from just placing
themselves into the upper left hand corner.  For example all my
own Motif programs do that, which is really annoying.  Even when
I specify
Style "*"           ActivePlacement
all those windows are placed there.  Why???

When I use SGI's window manager (4Dwm) the windows are placed
somewhere else.  So somehow the window manager must have to do
with that.

Can anyone help me with that please?

Please reply by personal email, since I am no longer on the FVWM
mailing list.  (too much work to do)

Thanks a lot in advance,
 Andy.

I'm using 2.0.40 on an Indigo 2 IRIX 6.1. Not really played with
SmartPlacement much. I'll give it a try.

Ditto, all my motif programs do that too. I just assumed I was doing
something stupid in my code :-) 

Also, something which annoys me ... some windows never have title bars
whatever I try to do with Style. Particularly Mosaic and Matlab plot windows.
This problem doesn't seem to occur with other window managers. Am I missing
something basic here?

Isn't it that the first matching line counts?  Have you tried
reversing the order of the lines?

It's probably due to PPosition info for these windows.  Try changing
the first line to:

Style "*" SmartPlacement, NoPPostion

Try the above style line and see if it helps.  I'm kind of suprised
though, since I don't believe that my motif programs that I've written
ever exhibited this behavior under fvwm...

Try this:

Style "*" DecorateTransient

Order shouldn't matter.  The more specific ones should have
precedence.

G'Day all,

 I'm new to X/Motif - that said, here we go... :)

 I have a program which was implemented under hp-vue and which will
not run under fvwm.  The error I get is:

 X Error : Bad Access (attempt to access private resource denied)
 Major Opcode of failed request : 28 (X_GrabButton)

 This error occurs just after the window for the program is drawn on
the screen (in random placement mode) or just after the position is
chosen by the user (in not random placement). I've read the fvwm
source code and found a likely suspect in the add_window.c file.

 The situation is this: I can't re-compile fvwm or change versions
(it's a long story) so I'm stuck with re-compiling the
afore-mentioned program... What I'm looking for is... what do I
change? Is there anything I should be looking for in my local-app's
code? (I didn't write this... I inherited it, BTW)

 Right, some info:

 OS = HP-UX 9.x
 X11R5
 HP700 series hardware
 FVWM VERSION = 1.241

 And here is the entire makefile for the fvwm compile...

The X-GrabButton error has been found in the past to come from
applications which attempt to use keys bound to features in fvwm.  I have
a Motif application which confused me in just this way until I realized
that the buttons bound to specific features in the program were also ones
which were bound to RaiseLower or similar features I had inherited from
the default .fvwmrc configuration I used as the basis for my
configuration.  Altering the window manager bindings to sidestep this made
the applications usable under fvwm.

I'm trying to get the sample QuitVerify form in the FvwmForm man page
working. I have the following menu entry:

+			"QuitVerity Form"	Module FvwmForm QuitVerify


When I try and invoke this nothing appears and upon inspection of my
.xsession-errors file I find:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range
for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  24
  Current serial number in output stream:  34

Any ideas what is happening??? 

All of my other modules work fine so I don't think it's an
installation problem. I'm running a Tatung Sparc w/ SunOS 4.1.4,
gcc-2.7.0, X11R6.

Thanks for any advice.

Michael

This is the first message to the tkgoodstuff list (and it's being sent
also to the fvwm list).  Welcome everybody!

This is to alert you to some new stuff and changes in the in-progress
4.1b5 tkgoodstuff (which works only with the just-released tcl7.5b1
and tk4.1b1).

The most interesting new thing is a new client "Pager" by Eric Kahler
that, like WindowList (which is now a client) works only when
tkgoodstuff is used as an fvwm module (tkgoodstuff must be executed as
a module by fvwm).  The Pager shows miniature versions of each fvwm
desktop.  It doesn't draw little windows like the FvwmPager module,
but lights up the pages that have windows on them, and shows you which
page/desktop you're on.  It allows you to
switch pages/desktops, and you can move a window to an arbitrary
window/desktop by dragging with mouse button 2 from the window's
button in the (tkgoodstuff) WindowList.  Eric and I would be
interested in feedback, including about desired additional features.

Notice that the docs for the in-progress tkgoodstuff are not up to
date.  Here is the latest stuff in the CHANGES file:

  NOW tkgoodstuff assumes tk4.1b1 or later (we're aiming at supporting
  the ultimate 4.1 release; and backward compatibility is too much
  work). 

     - Clock, Ical, Jots: use the new "clock" command instead of "exec
     date". 

     - tkgoodstuff: 

       + "create-label-box" renamed to "TKGLabelBox".

       + Use "ps -p [pid]" if "ps [pid]" gives an error, and don't
       assume there's a STAT column in the ps output (thanks
       J. Robinson).

       + Implement TKGAddToHook and TKGDoHook (general hook
       utilities).  Several hooks are defined (for client use) in
       tkgoodstuff, Fvwm.tcl, etc.

       + Change default fonts to non-italic, non-bold.

     - Biff: avoid tcl7.5b1's gets bugs by not doing "gets $f var".

     - New client "Pager" in progress by Eric Kahler.  Check out the
     current version in this distribution.  Needs tkgoodstuff to be
     run as an fvwm module (from the fvwm window manager).

     - The fvwm WindowList feature has become a client.  To call it,
     you now issue "Client WindowList".

     - Fvwm is no longer a client.  Its code is loaded by the WindowList
     and Pager clients as needed.  You will get an error if you load
     it as a client (as you had to in earlier versions).  (NOTE!!!)

     - Fvwm: fvwm's messages are more easily available to clients, we
     maintain a more complete database of the information available
     from fvwm, and we slightly enhanced tkfvwm (the new version of
     tkfvwm4.1 is needed to take advantage of all the information).
     Look at Fvwm.tcl for more info.  These changes were primarily to
     support Eric Kahler's cool Pager client.

     - Ical: Gave one alarm per item per calendar fetch.  Oops.  Stick
     to one per item.

     - Jots: Made widgets behave sensibly under manual resizing (until
     tk4.1b1's empty-frame bug showed up, that is).

You aren't doing anything wrong.  This is a bug.  I do know about it
(and related ones) and I think I have it in the TO-DO list.  If not,
it should be.

This seems to be a valid request, I think.  And a rather simple
addition to the code.  I'll see about getting it in there.

Hm...  There are some other requests with ways to control placement
behavior.  If those additions are made, this one might be able to be
put in there as well.  We'll have to see about that one.

If you are looking into this, please look at left/right options as well.

I like to have my "toolbar" located vertically on the left hand of the
screen.  This is problematic for Maximizing Horizontally.

An additional request I would like to make is to allow setting the
number of lines the window will expand. It would be really useful to be
able to toggle an xterm between 25 and 48 lines.

As one of the FvwmButtons entries, I have

*FvwmButtons Rlogin      small_xterm-sun.xpm  Popup MachineList

but it does not "pop up".  Instead, it functions like the Menu
function of FVWM2.  Is this a bug?

Style "*" NoPPosition
fixes this motif problem for me. I guess I need

No, that didn't fix the problem with Mosaic, but something else did. For
some reason (no idea why) I had a line
Style "shell"       NoTitle
which was hitting Mosaic (because it has Resource: shell ???). 

Thanks Chuck.

Popup menus won't really work correctly from any module unless the
module implements them itself and doesn't ask fvwm to pop them up.

Hello, all!

	Hope someone can answer this question.  The following lines worked
in fvwm1 version 1.24:

ButtonStyle 2 16 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0
80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1
ButtonStyle 4 4 50x35@1 65x65@0 35x65@0 50x35@1
ButtonStyle 6 4 50x65@1 35x35@1 65x35@1 50x65@0

	which allowed me to define a down, up, and X button style on my
windows.  However, I am running fvwm1 version1.22t at work, and when I use
these same lines, I see in my fvwm.console window:

fvwm: Bad button style in line ButtonStyle 2 16 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1
80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0 80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1
20x30@0 20x20@1

fvwm: Bad button style in line ButtonStyle 4 4 50x35@1 65x65@0 35x65@0 50x35@1

fvwm: Bad button style in line ButtonStyle 6 4 50x65@1 35x35@1 65x35@1 50x65@0

Anyone know how I can do this?  I'd really like to get this to work.  I
appreciate your time.

That ButtonStyle extension was added to 1.xx with version 1.23, I
believe.  So, your best bet is to compile 1.24r for use at work too,
since that will never work with 1.22t.

Sorry about that!  Tk4.1b1 doesn't handle empty frames properly, and
there are several other bugs.  But I want to use its new features and
I want to have a release ironed out by the time tk4.1 is finally
released, so I thought I might as well start now.

It's not impossible to have tcl7.5b1/tk4.1b1 around in addition to the
a2 versions (edit the makefiles so that, e.g., instead of
libtcl7.5.so, you get libtcl7.5b1.so, so that you use distinctive
library directories, etc.  But that's some serious work and disk
space.  Hopefully the next beta of tcl/tk won't be long in coming.

Thanks for your patience!

I am confused (in general about many things, but in specific about
PPosition).  Fvwm 1.nn used to have in its documentation a mention of the
NoPPosition style.  It was a relatively abbreviated description, so that
those not "in the know" didn't have their status much changed as a result
of reading it.  It seems to be even more nebulous in the fvwm2 docs (as in:
it seems not to be mentioned at all).  Am I overlooking something in the
manpages?  There were some much earlier messages on the list touching on 
this feature, but I don't have them recorded.  I mention this only 
because the recent questions asked by users made me try to find the 
answer in the docs and I couldn't.

I've just switched over to 2.0.40 (from 1.23something) on an RS6000, AIX3.2.5.
Every time I use restart to restart fvwm I get the output below (I noticed
this under 1.23 also).  Can you tell me what I can do to fix it?

The docs for 2.xx are not 100% accurate yet, which is the main reason
why it's still in beta.  It's what I'm trying to focus on cleaning up
right now.

Hopefully this weekend I'll be able to get some more work done on the
docs, make/install problems, and more bugfixes and have another
release like Monday or so, which will be the precursor to the first
official release.

As a guess, you're probably running FvwmButtons that has swallowed
some programs, right?  If so, you'll probably see these same messages
if you just kill FvwmButtons.

If this is the problem, I wouldn't really worry about it, since there
may not be a lot you can do about it.

Note also that the SloppyFocus command is mentioned briefly in the
'description' of fvwm, but no further mention is made of it in the
docs.

Hi, FVWM-fans!

Thanks a lot for all your answers.  The very first one that I got
already did the trick:

> It's probably due to PPosition info for these windows.  Try changing
> the first line to:
> 
> Style "*" SmartPlacement, NoPPostion

That was it!  I wonder why "NoPPostion" isn't mentioned in the 
man page (fvwm2.0.39).  Could you please put it in there?


But this other subject still riddles me:

So, why don't they, Chuck?

Thanks, y'all for your help!

With SunOs, I had an old Xconsole which pop-up each time it receives a
message and which otherwise completely disappears. Unfortunately, it is
written with old Xt constructs and did not compile under Solaris.

To replace this old Xconsole, I wonder if it is possible to instruct
fvwm to open a window each times it gets output.

I hacked xconsole to do this as well. It's pretty straightforward to download
the xconsole source from ftp.x.org, and then add:

XMapWindow (XtDisplay (top), XtWindow (top))

to Notify(). I believe that's all you need, it was a while ago.

Works like a charm. Makes it very difficult to miss a talk request, without
the annoyance of it getting broadcast to every xterm.

The proposed fvwm addition would be pretty cool. I would much like to hear
about the feasability of doing this from someone who knows the code better
than I. I have heard though that fvwm has run out of bits to encode Style
flags, and that would be the way to implement it. 

I also would be curious about how efficiently one can watch windows for output
in X11 - I sense a neat trick that I know nothing about.

That is correct.  There really aren't any Style flags left right now.
But fear not - one of my first big tasks after the mythical 'first
official release' which is actually approaching now is to redo that to
allow more Style flags in a nice clean way.  It's not going to be easy
the way I want to do it, but it should be worth it.

I did a lot of doc updates this weekend for the next release (2.0.41)
which I'll hopefully get out today after a little more testing.  This
is in there now.

I misspoke slightly there...  I believe it's actually more of a
combination of more specific and order.  But the above order is
correct. "*" should always come first, otherwise it'll augment or
override everything else.

As for why those other ones weren't being placed Actively, I don't
know.  I'll have to investigate that some.

if i get the manpage right there are two different switches:

SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement
and
RandomPlacement/ActivePlacement

therefore all you windows are placed "smart" which overrides the active 
placement
for the last two. i'm not sure but try:

Style "*Test*"      ActivePlacement,DumbPlacement
Style "*Demo*"      ActivePlacement,DumbPlacement

which should turn off the SmartPlacement explicitly.

Howdy folks,

At long last I've managed to get the next beta release of fvwm2 out.
Available from ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   users     489477 Feb 19 14:52 fvwm-2.0.41.tar.gz

And here's the ChangeLog:

2.0.41
       1. More FAQ updates & man page corrections
       2. Patch to limit GetFdWidth to FD_SETSIZE to prevent fvwm from
          eating too much cpu under bsdi if 'unlimit descriptors' is used
       3. Ressurrected desktop edge wrap via EdgeScroll*1000 feature
       4. Fixed library link order (fixes the sometimes undefined
          XLoadQueryFont problem)
       5. Renamed fvwm_icons subdir to be just icons, documentation to be
          just docs
       6. Removed FvwmPrompt (use FvwmForm instead, since it's better anyways)
       7. Todd Fries 'UseStyle' patch
       8. XClientMessages sent to icon windows (that aren't
          XA_WM_CHANGE_STATE ones) are now sent along to to the apps
          window
       9. FvwmButtons fixes from Jarl for incorrectly drawn buttons and
          better no title handling
       10. FvwmForm now uses GetFontOrFixed, instead of silently failing
           if font can't be found
       11. New Imake setup based on patch from Mark Powell (let's see if
           people have less problems with this, since it's more 'standard'
           now)
       12. Changed top directory to contain version number
       13. Modified Style parsing to (hopefully) do less string compares
           for a potential speedup
       14. Modified DispatchEvent to use a jump table instead of a switch
           statement, again for a potential speedup
       15. FvwmIconBox patches from Nobutaka Suzuki

Notes:

  #1 The docs should be a little more accurate now, but I know some stuff
     is still missing/wrong.  Let me know when you run accross these
     things...

  #4 This is actually taken care of by #11

  #9 I had some intermittent problems w/ FvwmButtons not swallowing
     the pager correctly.  I haven't investigated that yet.

  #11 This should be a smother build & install process now...

  #13 & #14 Hopefully these won't create any problems.

It won't be so long between releases for the next one, hopefully.
Especially if (heaven forbid) there are any big build problems like
last time.

Please note that I didn't get all of the patches & bugfixes in there
that I wanted to, so if something you were waiting for wasn't in there
(again), hopefully I'll get it in the next one.

A bug I found (currently FTPing 2.0.41 so don't know if it's still
present there).

	* Trying to load either FvwmIconBox or FvwmWinList into
	  FvwmButtons (SwallowModule) makes them (IB & WL) crash

---

Also, I think that the addition of a Sleep built-in, would be a Good
Thing(tm).  The reason I'm asking for this is that I haven't been able
to find a way to do the following:

AddToMenu Quit-Verify   "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
+                       "Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
+                       "Yes, Save Desktop" Quit-and-Save

AddToFunc Quit-and-Save    "I" Module FvwmSaveDesk
+                          "I" Quit

The reason it doesn't work is that before FvwmSaveDesk has the time to
create the new.xinitrc in $HOME, FVWM causes it to exit.  Unless I'm
doing something wrong, or there IS another way to do this, the
addition of a Sleep function, that would cause FVWM to pause for 'n'
seconds before executing the next command would fix this.

Any help / comments / suggestions should be directed at me
(adrenlin@ki.net) since I'm not subscribed to the list (get enough
mail as it is!) as well as posted for the benefit of others.

Solaris 2.5 defines several M_XXX things in <sys/stream.h> which is
included by <netinet/in.h>.  Unfortunately, one of these is M_ERROR
which is used by fvwm.

This is only a problem with the FvwmAudio module with builtin rplay
support.  The rplay header file includes <netinet/in.h>.

Can M_ be renamed to something else?  How about MODULE_?  I'd be
willing to write a perl script to do the conversion.

Hi,

I think there is a small bug in the search algorithm of fvwm-2.0.40 and
fvwm-2.0.41.  According to the man-page, the IconPath is the search path for
bitmaps, while the PixmapPath is for pixmaps.  Of course, the latter only
makes sense when compiled with XPM.  My guess is that fvwm should search both
paths when compiled with XPM.  However, it doesn't.  It *only* searches
searches the PixmapPath.  The following patch fixes this.


*** Picture.c	Mon Nov  6 17:36:25 1995
--- Picture.c.new	Wed Jan  3 12:52:22 1996
***************
*** 46,53 ****
  #ifdef XPM
  
  
!   path = findIconFile(name, PixmapPath,R_OK);
!   if(path == NULL)return;  
  
    XGetWindowAttributes(dpy,Root,&root_attr);
    xpm_attributes.colormap = root_attr.colormap;
--- 46,54 ----

!     return;
  
    XGetWindowAttributes(dpy,Root,&root_attr);
    xpm_attributes.colormap = root_attr.colormap;


Greetings,

Pieter

Hi,

We've been having problems with the focusing of fvwm-1.24r over
Solaris2.4.  The application stops receiving all keyboard input and
subsequent mouse clicks do nothing.  Fvwm seems to have lost focus. 
Here are a couple of typical bug reports:

	Cannot activate text field by clicking on it with left mouse
	button.  To activate field you need to hold the middle mouse
	button down all the time you type in values.

	The numeric keypad stops working.  (probably includes the
	rest of the keyboard, first line support never seems to
	check this)

We do have a work around.  If you click on the current window in the
virtual desktop pager, everything is restored to normal.  Simple fix?
Not so....trying to explain this to inexperienced users is a nightmare,
the virtual desktop and pager get ehm totally confused.  There is also
the fact that we don't like having known bugs in our applications :-)

We've tried various different configurations of the .fvwmrc and messed
with xmodmap and XKeySymDB to no avail.  Moving to verison 2.04 isn't
really an option because high reliablilty and availability
are extremely important features of our system.

I understand that your concentrating on bug fixes and issues of the 2.04
release, any help would be appreciatied.

Thanks,

Adam.

I'm having a bit of trouble with xpm icons.
What is the most popular utility for preserving shaped xpm
icons or making them from transparent gifs for example?

Xv tends to leave a lovely rectangle of a solid garish random
colour about my nice new icons. Any help appreciated.

This is with Fvwm-2.0.41 and emacs-19.30 on NetBSD/i386-current.

If I put the following in my ~/.emacs file:

	(menu-bar-mode -1)

to get rid of emacs menubar, emacs will "hang" for a few extra seconds
at startup, and then, when it removes the menubar, the last line of
the emacs window (the minibuffer) will become invisible (you can see
the top of the line just below the visible window).

Without the above line, emacs will start quickly, and with the correct
window size. I'm not sure if Fvwm or emacs is to blame for this, but
the problem does not appear under Fvwm 1.

Any hints appreciated,

bring the xpm file up in a text editor, locate the character
representing the background color, and change the color entry to "none".
i.e.,

/* XPM */
static char *MtDew[] = {
/* width height num_colors chars_per_pixel */
"    21    38        9            1",

". c none",
"# c #808080",

where a . makes up the backround in this particular image...

This is perhaps rather silly, but I've just been using my favourite
icon editor "vi" to replace the relevant random colour with "none".
Usually the first colour in the XPM file is the one that needs changing;
you end up changing from something like:
   "       c #EEEEEEEEEEEE",
to
   "       c none",
The ImageMagick package can be used to create transparent backgrounds
interactively, but I found "vi" to be a lot faster.

Use pixmap, the program to xpm as bitmap is to xbm.  But, I have 
intermittent (many) problems with it.  I get segmentation faults, odd 
unknown crashes, etc.  But, it is worth the hassel to get transparent 
(NONE) pixels.  Of course, if anyone knows of a better one for Linux, let 
us know.

I prefer xpaint.  While it's not for Linux but for Unix systems in
general, I'm sure you can compile it on Linux.  I know it works on
FreeBSD 2.1 and HP/UX 9 and 10.

xpaint had a number of nifty tools like a spray can and region
embosser, and it works with the TrueColor visual (xpaint -24).

It can save XPM format but doesn't support transparent colors.  But,
it's easy to workaround that limitation.  Just reserve a color that
you want to be transparent, then edit the XPM file with a text editor.
Change the color entry in the file to

	"       s None  c None",

and it'll be transparent.

Has anyone else had problems compiling FvwmForms.c in 2.0.41?
As far as I can tell, it needs something like this near the top:
  XFontStruct *GetFontOrFixed(Display *disp, char *fontname);
without which I get all sorts of ugly compilation errors.

Also:
"FvwmForm.c", line 1529: warning(1136): too many arguments in function call
    ReadConfig(argv[3]);

and of course the really frightening "#define fprintf dummy" near the
beginning of the code.  Perhaps there should be a big "HERE THERE BE
DRAGONS" at the top of FvwmForm.c?  :-)

One other fvwm 2.0.41 compile-time problem I've noticed... if Fvwm.tmpl
says:
  #define FvwmName       fvwm2       
then the resulting "make install" command line for fvwm will look like:
  bsdinst -c fvwm2 /usr/local/bin       fvwm2
Getting rid of the additional spaces in the #define statements in Fvwm.tmpl
seems to fix this problem.

I'm not an imake guru, and I'm running a beta-test OS, so... is this
a bug in my imake, or is it incorrect to put those additional spaces
in the "#define" line in a template file?  Thanks -

Xpaint works under Linux; my Slackware came with it.  It has been known to
bomb occasionally, but it's quite functional.

I was afraid that might cause some problems.  I know that others will
see this as well, since similiar things happened in the past.

I'll clean it up for the next release.

Yes, I tried xpaint, once I was sort-of understanding the way to text edit 
the xpm file, and I tried to open a file pixmap had problems with (my 
netscape icon), and it too crashed.  I guess it's either a problem with 
the pixmap, or something is wrong with my Xpm library.  But, it's the new 
one, and the pixmap shows up fine.  I don't know what's wrong.  Could 
someone briefly explain what could cause a segmentation fault while 
loading a pixmap?

I think you're all partially right and wrong!

Fvwm applies ALL matching styles to each window. This way
Style "*" NoTitle
Style "emacs" NoPPosition
will result in an emacs window with NoPPosition and NoTitle.

In the event that there is a conflict, I believe that the last match is used:
Style "*" ActivePlacement
Style "emacs" RandomPlacement
results in emacs being randomplacement.

BUT ActivePlacement and SmartPlacement do not conflict. RandomPlacement
and SmartPlacement don't conflict either. The rule is, use smartplacement,
but if you can only find a dumb place to put the window, then revert
to active (or random) placement. Another way to think of it is that
there are 4 placement options
dumb Random
dumb Active
smart Random
smart Active


Hope this helps

When running xpostit version 3.0 you can pop up a dialog box (Athena Widget 
set) to set the note title. Under fvwm this will not accept the keyboard 
focus. It does accept the mouse/pointer focus. This feature does work under 
twm. Anyone got any ideas, or come across this before?

It seems to me that not all windows are being presented with
title bars as they sould.  No matter what I do I can't get
title bars on certain windows to show.  I make sure that I don't
have any references to NoTitles in may rc file and still no title bars
on some windows.  An example of this is the Netscape configuration
dialog windows (ie. General Preferences).

I have seen title bars on these windows with other window managers.

I'm using:

Linux 1.3.6x
FVWM  2.0p4x
xFree86 3.1.2b

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Mmm, add a line like this to your .fvwmrc file:

Style "*"	DecorateTransient

These popups are 'Transient' and get no titles by default (I think).

Subject: FVWM: FvwmButtons "Variable Relief" patch
Message-ID: <Pine.ULT.3.91.960220212714.16831C-100000@lynx.cs.washington.edu>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

Here's a patch that allows the user to specify the depth of the reliefs 
in FvwmButtons on a per-button basis.  The .fvwm2rc line

	*FvwmButtons(w x h) ...

may now be written

	*FvwmButtons(w x h , r) ...

where r specifies the new relief, from -5 (sunken 5 pixels) to 5 (raised 
five pixels).  The default is 2.

Apply the patch in the "modules" subdirectory of a clean 2.0.41 
distribution.  I even updated the man page!  Let me know how it works.

Greg

Is there a way to achieve Exec clauses or Function/Macros which
take the current contents of the cut buffer or selection as an
argument?

This would permit click-drag selection of arbitrary text eg
an embedded URL in a screen of text, and then firing up
an ftp/netscape instance with it as a command argument...

can you embed ${USER} and other things anywhere in a .fvwmrc

That's the solution!!!  Great, thanks a lot!

You can get xcb.  Then, "xcb -p0" will print the contents of the X
cutbuffer.  Obviously, in a shell script "`xcb -p0`" is useful.

Get xcb from your favorite x.org mirror.

Hi, I'm having build problems with this. I think the escaping of the
definitions on the gcc command line is going a bit wrong:

gcc -fpcc-struct-return -c -O2     -I. -I../libs  -I/usr/local/X11R6/include      -DSHAPE -DXPM   -DFVWM_ICONDIR=\"/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps \:/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/fvwm/bitmaps\"  -DFVWMDIR=\"/usr/local/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2\"  -DFVWMRC=\".fvwm2rc\" builtins.c
gcc: :/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/fvwm/bitmaps": No such file or directory
builtins.c:0: unterminated string or character constant
builtins.c:0: possible real start of unterminated constant

In Fvwm.tmpl I have:

#define FvwmIconPath /usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps \:/usr/local/X11R6/inc
lude/X11/fvwm/bitmaps

However if I remove the space in front of the colon it builds correctly.
Perhaps a comment to this effect in the .tmpl file would be useful?

Also we are having problem with swallowing stuff into the FvwmButtons
module. I'm getting people to upgrade to version2, and even after a lot
of hacking he can't get it to work with version2. Here the relevant section
of his config is given below. Any help would be much appreciated.

	Best wishes,

		Richard.

Check out xcb (available from ftp.x.org).  It can be used to pass the
current selection to any program in shell scripts, fvwm Exec
statements, etc.

I will put a comment about that in there for the next release, but
since the example line for that included in the Fvwm.tmpl doesn't have
a space it it, I wouldn't expect too many people to have a problem
with this.

The problem is your usage of the "+".  It is not a generic line
continuation character.  As it states in the man page, it can only be
used to continue function and menu definitions.  Keep the lines
together, like so:

  *FvwmButtons(4x1) - whatever SwallowModule "Fvwm Pager" FvwmPager 0 3

and things should start working better.

My first question concerns the way FVWM draws menus near the right edge of the
display. I use FVWM-style menus -- submenus appear just as the pointer touches
a menu entry. Normally, a submenu appears to the right of its parent. At the
right edge of the display, however, things get crowded; the submenu appears
directly on top of its parent. This can be a problem, especially when, as in my
setup, there exist more than two levels of submenus. Could FVWM be changed so
that, at the right edge of the display, a submenu appears to the left of its
parent?


My second question addresses a long-existing problem: the method by which
FvwmButtons arranges buttons of various sizes. In this instance, I place a menu
button, an xload, an xclock, and several "switch to desk X" buttons in one
FvwmButtons window. Here's my setup:


*FvwmButtonsFore	DEFAULT_FOREGROUND
*FvwmButtonsBack	DEFAULT_BACKGROUND
*FvwmButtonsGeometry	650x40+0-0
*FvwmButtonsRows	2
*FvwmButtonsFont	DEFAULT_TITLE_FONT
*FvwmButtons(1x2)	FVWM	xlogo16.xpm	menu main-menu
*FvwmButtons(5x2)	-	-       swallow "xloadFvwm" exec xload -name
xloadFvwm &
*FvwmButtons(1x2)	-	-	swallow "xclockFvwm" exec xclock
-name xclockFvwm &
*FvwmButtons		Main		-	desk 0 0
*FvwmButtons		WebSrv		-	desk 0 1
*FvwmButtons		Browse1		-	desk 0 2
*FvwmButtons		Browse2		-	desk 0 3
*FvwmButtons		Notes		-	desk 0 4
*FvwmButtons		Post-Its	-	desk 0 5
*FvwmButtons		WebLog		-	desk 0 6
*FvwmButtons		PrxyLog		-	desk 0 7
*FvwmButtons		Misc1		-	desk 0 8
*FvwmButtons		Misc2		-	desk 0 9
*FvwmButtons		Misc3		-	desk 0 10
*FvwmButtons		Mail		-	desk 0 11


DEFAULT_BACKGROUND, DEFAULT_FOREGROUND, and DEFAULT_TITLE_FONT are M4 macros.

The above configuration produces the following look:

+------+-----------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|menu  |xload xload|xclock|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|
|      |xload xload|xclock+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|button|xload xload|xclock|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|
+------+-----------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Here's the problem: I want to put xclock at the right side of the window, so it
all looks like this:

+------+-----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+------+
|menu  |xload xload|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|xclock|
|      |xload xload+----+----+----+----+----+----+xclock|
|button|xload xload|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|xclock|
+------+-----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+------+

I've had no success yet. If I take the logical approach, i.e., move the line
referencing "xclockFvwm" to the end of the FvwmButtons list, I end up with this
arrangement:

+------+-----------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+
|menu  |xload xload|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk |desk|
|      |xload xload+----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+
|button|xload xload|desk|desk|desk|desk|desk|clock|    |
+------+-----------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+

Nothing exists in the lower-right corner. FvwmButtons ignores the size
specification for xclock, "(1x2)". I've tried using silly sizes like "(10x2)",
but FvwmButtons just puts more "desk" buttons in the top row, and leaves xclock
at the bottom in a 10x1 size button.

Ideas, anyone? I've been scratching my head over this for a bit, but I suspect
the problem lies in FvwmButtons.

fvwmbutton uses left to right placement (at least for *FvwmButtonsRows 2)
:
when fvwmbutton gets to swallowing the clock, there's only one row left, so
the "silly" size 1x2 is ignored. 

I got tired of shuffling all the icons 'till everything fits again,
so I use a symbolic link FvwmSwallow (points to FvwmButton)

FvwmButton declares the small buttons, FvwmSwallow swallows my console,
Fvwm Buttons and the pager. (just some more depth added to the 3d look)


see my .fvwm2rc below (sorry, had to break some lines):

Try xcb. It should be available on 'ftp.x.org' and its mirrors somewhere
along 'contrib/utilities'. It'll allow you to grab the current X selection,
store it and handle it any way you like. Just as an example, I use the
following shell script:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

xselection=`xcb -S 0;xcb -p 0`

if echo $xselection | grep -q "^\(http\|ftp\|gopher\|telnet\|wais\|file\)://";then
  netscape -remote "openURL($xselection)" &>/dev/null || netscape "$xselection"
elif echo $xselection | grep -q "\w\+@\w\+";then
  gnudoit -q "(mail nil \"$xselection\")" &>/dev/null|| xemacs -eval "(mail nil \"$xselection\")"
else
  tkmanclient -new $xselection
fi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will take the current selection, see if it looks like an URL, an email
address or anything else, and send it to netscape, xemacs mail-mode or
tkman respectively. I have bound this script to a title button via fvwm's
Exec directive.

Regards,

Stephan

i don't like to see this changed as well. 
another approach could be to make submenues only pop up if you are
on the arrow on the right side of the menu entry.
of course it would be nice if you could choose the different behaviours.

try this setup to get the xclock to the end of the buttonbar:

   But that is how it works ... at least for me.  I have set
MenuStyle ... fvwm and get what you describe.  I tried MenuStyle
... mwm and submenus started popping up immediately.  I moved it
back because I don't like that, either.

> try this setup to get the xclock to the end of the buttonbar:

   I don't have that specific problem, but back in some version
1.2xy GoodStuff was putting buttons wherever it liked with no
regard to order.  The stock 2.0.41 FvwmButtons is doing much
better.  So far I prefer having large buttons activate pop-ups
to having more, smaller buttons, but if I change my mind I'll
remember these hints.

   (Unrelated:  since I don't send much to the list, I'll stick
in here a second for the StickyOnDesk -- or whatever,
StickyOnPage might be better -- style option on the TO-DO list.
I'd love to have an IRC window follow me almost everywhere, but
not to the pages where Netscape or XV are running.  A way to
fiddle with Z-order when starting programs would help, too.
Since I don't have time to do these things, even though I'd
like to, I'll be quiet now.  Go 2.1.0!)

I do the same thing to invoke script that will invoke a new or a -remote
openURL netscape window.   I did not like to have to call xcb twice (-S n and
-p n), so I patched xcb to allow for this in 1 command execution with the -P n
flag.   I sent diffs to the author, but got no response.   Here are the diffs:

i see...
this would be nice to have in the manpage. maybe there are 
other "interesting" features that come with the menustyle that 
should be mentioned. i just looked it up and it only
says that
# The style option  is  either  "fvwm"  or  "mwm",  which

hopefull, i'm not too demanding chuck

Dear all,

the default action is to rename fvwm and its man page to fvwm2 so that
there is no conflict with version 1.  Also, the modules are installed
in a separate directory.

However, what's missing is the separation of the man pages for the
modules -- they overwrite the version 1 files.

did you get any answers yet?

I got:
imake -DUseInstalled -I/XTech/lib/X11/config
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 231: Unexpected end of line seen

this is the line:
XCOMM Template file for Fvwm

I commented out the XCOMM lines from Fvwm.tmpl.

this did more: But I got:
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 265: Unexpected end of line seen
Current working directory /home/vta_host/albrecht/fvwm-2.0.41/sample.fvwmrc

this looks as follows:
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
all::
	@echo "make in $(CURRENT_DIR) done"

InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))

###########################################################################
# common rules for all Makefiles - do not edit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

this obviously comes from the imakefile:

#ifdef InstallSample
InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
#endif

setting to InstallSample to NO doesn't help since it's an ifdef.
Commenting it out doesn't help either, since there is an 
#ifndef InstallSample
#define InstallSample NO
further down in Fvwm.tmpl 

So I put out the 
InstallNonExecFile(system.fvwmrc,$(FVWMDIR))
from the Imakefile.

that helped.
Question: 
	Bug in our imake configuration -
		where does this InstallNonExecFile come from?
	Bug in imakefile (ifdef)?



now 'make' worked smooth.

only when I said make install.man, it didn't take the configured path
FvwmManPath but MANDIR:

InstallManPage(program,$(MANDIR))

I changed all instanced of MANDIR to MANPATH.


questions: do I need to have our imake configuration upgraded to handle
XCOMM, InstallNonExecFile or are these bugs.

did I do the right things?
or are there other fixes?

Some time ago, I used to get similar errors in other Imake configurations.
The reason herefore was that, in X11R4 and before, neither XCOMM nor Instal=
lNonExecFile()
used to be defined in imake's config/ files.
Here's what I added (and have since been imake'ing happily fvwm as well as
numerous other imake'ed packages):


______in /usr/lib/X11/config/Imake.tmpl, I added:_____

Anyone know if the newest fvwm works with xfaces any better than older 
(i.e. 2.0pl39) fvwm releases?  My xfaces icons and annotations get 
clipped on the left side due, I'm told, to a quirk with fvwm.

Thanks for your reply,

Bret

PS - Please bear with me, I'm too lazy to ftp and compile the newest stuff
just to see if this has been changed ;-)

I am running AIX 3.2.5 and I built fvwm 2.0.41 with NO problems.
I use FvwmButtons, Fvwmbacker, FvwmIdent, FvwmPager, FvwmWinList, etc.
and all are working okay.

Unfortunately, my system has multiple copies of X11 libraries and
C libraries.  I can't tell you if I linked against an IBM standard setup or
an in-house hacked version.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was both.  :)

I too use and compile it under AIX as well as Linux before I release.
Haven't had any problems like this.

Hi,
I am trying to install version 2.0.41 of fvwm but my 
system seems to lack Pixmaps and Xpm (XpmLibs and 
XpmIncs as specified in the Fvwm.temp file).

If anyone knows where I could ftp these files could
you please let me know.
Many thanks

ARGH!

Sorry, I have to suggest it.

Although, generally speaking, I perfer the simplicity of twm over mwm,
there is one mwm feature I wish fvwm could use. . . . 

In mwm pull-down menus, if you click on a sub menu, that sub-menu remain
up and neither window will disappear until you select something from the
sub-menu or you re-click on somethign from the main window.

i.e.

+--------------+
| Xstuff       |
+==============+
| foo          |
| bar        > |
| goo          |
| blue         |
| shoe       > |
| moo          |
+--------------+

If this pull-down is bound to a left click on the root window, it will
pop up and remain until either something is selected or you re-click on
the title.

I want to be click on "bar" and get the following menu.

+--------------+
| Xstuff       |
+==============+
| foo          +--------------+
|#bar########>#| bar          |
| goo          +==============+
| blue         | blob         |
| shoe       > | flob         |
| moo          | mob          |
+--------------| cob          |
               | job          |
               +--------------+

This menu configuration will remain until I select something from either
menu or I click on the root again to kill both menus.

In short, play aronud with your netscape bookmarks (or any other Motif
program you have sitting around).

I don't think this would be a complicated change becasue fvwm already
does this except when pass the pointer over another option in the Xstuff
menu.  I only want the menu to disappear if you explicity click on
something in the Xstuff window.  Of course, if I really knew the complexity 
of this kind of change, I would hack out the diff myself.

Actually, I think this should be the behavior for MwmMenus.  I
also wish (as someone previously suggested) that the windows will
automatically draw to the left instead of to the right if there is not
enough space.  Although I don't think mwm does this, nobody said we
can't improve on the concept.  :)

If this is already possible and I just drew all that ASCII for nothing,
someone please correct me.

Thanks,

-Alan

The manual of fvwm says:

          UseStyle takes one arg, which is the name of another
          style.  That way you can have unrelated window names
          easily inherit similiar traits without retyping.  For
          example: 'Style "rxvt" UseStyle "XTerm"'.

And, fvwm/style.c says:

          while(isspace(*restofline))restofline++;
          tmp = restofline;
          while( tmp && *tmp &&(*tmp != ',')&&
                 (*tmp != '\n')&&(!isspace(*tmp)))
            tmp++;
          if((len = tmp - restofline) > 0)
          {
            nptr = Scr.TheList;
            while(nptr && mystrncasecmp(restofline,nptr->name,len) )
              nptr = nptr->next;
            if (nptr&& !mystrncasecmp(restofline,nptr->name,len))
            {
		/* ... processing ... */
	    }

Assume that following line is written in the configulation file.

	Style "XTerm" NoTitle
	Style "rxvt" UseStyle "XTerm"

If we trust the manual, style of rxvt is the same of XTerm. But fvwm
complains about this description, i.e.,

	fvwm: UseStyle: "XTerm" style not found!

It is natual when you see the code (see the condition of the while
loop). Second line should be:

	Style "rxvt" UseStyle XTerm

My question is simple: Which is the true, manual or code ?

***

And, here is a short patch to add newline to error message of 'UseStyle'
(I think).

I just caught up on my FVWM list mail... more of a response than I expected!
Thanks to all who sent me information; specifically, Albrecht Kadlec, Michael
Tiefenback, and Alexander Sorg, who all pointed out the solution to my
button-placement problem. Since FvwmButtons arranges buttons left-to-right,
then top-to-bottom, a 2-row button at the end of my setup always appeared as a
single-row button in the bottom row. With that button placed at the end of the
first row of buttons, however, the other buttons arrange themselves correctly.
Here's my revised setup:

*FvwmButtonsFore	DEFAULT_FOREGROUND
*FvwmButtonsBack	DEFAULT_BACKGROUND
*FvwmButtonsGeometry	650x40+0-0
*FvwmButtonsRows	2
*FvwmButtonsFont	DEFAULT_TITLE_FONT
*FvwmButtons(1x2)	FVWM	xlogo16.xpm	menu main-menu
*FvwmButtons(5x2)	-	-       swallow "xloadFvwm" exec xload -name
xloadFvwm &
*FvwmButtons		Main		-	desk 0 0
*FvwmButtons		WebSrv		-	desk 0 1
*FvwmButtons		Browse1		-	desk 0 2
*FvwmButtons		Browse2		-	desk 0 3
*FvwmButtons		Notes		-	desk 0 4
*FvwmButtons		Post-Its	-	desk 0 5
# this was at the end of the list
*FvwmButtons(1x2)	-	-	swallow "xclockFvwm" exec xclock
-name xclockFvwm &
*FvwmButtons		WebLog		-	desk 0 6
*FvwmButtons		PrxyLog		-	desk 0 7
*FvwmButtons		Misc1		-	desk 0 8
*FvwmButtons		Misc2		-	desk 0 9
*FvwmButtons		Misc3		-	desk 0 10
*FvwmButtons		Mail		-	desk 0 11
# xclock button used to be here

Just to check, I looked at the manual page; there's no mention of FvwmButtons'
method for arranging things. Yet another addition/correction for the man pages,
I guess -- sorry, Chuck. 1/2 :-)


As for my menu problems, I goofed. In my original message, I said I used
fvwm-style menus (click-to-display). In fact, I use mwm-style menus, which
automatically appear as the pointer enters them. I've switched to fvwm-style
menus for the time being, but that doesn't really eliminate the problem: a
submenu should appear to the left of its parent when there's insufficient room
to the right of the parent.

I seem to be encountering some problems with installing fvwm.  I should 
probably start off by saying that I don't have root privs, and am 
therefor trying to install fvwm purely within the confines of my 
account.  I got to the point of make all, but for some reason the gcc 
command in the make files has a -xF on it and my gcc compiler says it 
doesn't understand the language F.  Can someone help walk me through the 
process a little further?  It would be greatly appreciated.

  I think I haven't tried hacking fvwm's code since way back in 0.9/1.x
  times, pre-modules, so I'm not sure of all the side effects of the
  changes below, specially on the impact on inter-module traffic and module
  behavior, but this patch will make the "window icons" in the pager move,
  while a window is being moved by fvwm, i.e. non-pager initiated moves.

  I've looked at coding the reverse effect, i.e. having the real windows
  move, while the pager icons move, but that is much more complicated, and
  I think I remember what happened when Rob try to do it, and things got in
  a nice seemingly endless loop, where the icon will move, would tell the
  window to move, which would cause the pager icon to move, etc.

Hi,

I've experienced several crashes of openwin with
fvwm 1.24r. This occured randomly (about after one
or two weeks use) when I tried to access the FvwmPager...

Here's the stack trace I could get afterwards:

=>[1] MoveViewport(0x0, 0x384, 0x1, 0x0, 0x38, 0x4), at 0x242f8

Any help would be grateful,

Desc...

The -xF is an option that is in my Sun's configuration files, but the gcc
compiler does not understand it.  Hopefully, the compilation proceeds in
spite of the compiler complaining, and you can ignore them (that's the
simple fix!!!).  But if you really get tired of seeing the error messages,
you can create a 'site.def' file to override the settings for your
computer.  

First, find the site.def and other imake configuration files on your
system (on my Sun, they're in /usr/openwin/lib/config).  Put a copy of 
site.def in one of your local directories so you can edit it.  Mine has a 
'HasGcc' option that I can set in the 'BeforeVendorCF' section:

#define HasGcc YES

To tell xmkmf and imake to use this new 'site.def' file, set the 
environment variable IMAKEINCLUDE to: 
 
IMAKEINCLUDE=-I/your_directory_name_here   (i.e., whatever directory you put it in)

Now, doing an 'xmkmf' will use this modified 'site.def' file.  If the 
problem still persists (or you don't seem to have the HasGcc 
option....probably varies from system-to-system), go back to the 
configuration directory and grep for 'xF':

$ grep xF *
Imake.tmpl:#define OptimizedCDebugFlags -O -xF
Imake.tmpl:#define DebuggableCDebugFlags -g -DDEBUG -xF
sun.cf:#define DefaultCCOptions -DSYSV -DSVR4 -xF -Wa,-cg92

On my system, HasGcc took care of 'DefaultCCOptions', but after looking at
Imake.tmpl file, I still had to override the other two.  In the AfterVendorCF
section of site.def, you would add lines *such as*: (again, all these
configuration files are different, so look at yours and edit appropriately): 

#ifdef OptimizedCDebugFlags
#undef OptimizedCDebugFlags
#endif
#define OptimizedCDebugFlags -O   (without the -xF!!!)

#ifdef DebuggableCDebugFlags
#undef DebuggableCDebugFlags
#endif
#define DebuggableCDebugFlags -g -DDEBUG 


This works for me.  Or, you could just ignore the 'language F not recognized'
warnings .... :-)

Hope this helps you out.

With this patch, fvwm can now understand Openlook [Virtual] Window
Manager hints.  Programs compiled with XView or OLIT now have control
over which window decorations are displayed.

I have added a new Style option called OLDecor (and it's inverse
NoOLDecor) to use hints, approximately like MwmDecor.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm2 IconBox and Cursor
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

Hi,

I have been using fvwm 1.4 and have just installed fvwm 2.0 on my Linux system.
There are two problems I encountered:

First, I can't seem to get FvwmIconBox running properly. I does come up, but I
cannot get it to display any icons. It just sits there and does nothing.
I used the same configuration for the IconBox as with fvwm 1.4, which is basically
the same as in the man pages.

The second problem is, that I realy liked the feature of fvwm 1.4 to change the
appearance of the mouse pointer. Is there a similar feature in fvwm 2? I couldn't
find anything in the documentation, except that the Cursor command is no longer
supported.

Any help is appreceated.

thanks in advance

I just had this bright(?) idea, when switching desktop with the keys,
why not save the position of the mouse cursor, and restore it next
time I pass that desktop? 

Is it something that only I need or?

The reason why I would like this is that sometimes I work with the
xtem up to the right in one desktop, and my emacs to the left in the
other desktop (and also trying to migrate from the mouse) so when I
have to write something in the other window I have to move the desktop
and then move the mouse.

And clicktofocus is _no_ alternative.

As much as I dislike adding another field to the FvwmWindow structure,
I just might incorporate this patch into the next release.  I haven't

My solution to this problem was to have my keys that do GotoPage and
Desk run a function that also calls Next so that the window on that
page (I typically only have one) gets focus when I enter it.  It's
mildly annoying if there's more than one window on the page and the
"wrong" one gets selected, but another keystroke on a key bound to
Next takes care of it.  Here's the relevant stuff from my .fvwm2rc:

Style "Fvwm*" CirculateSkip
Style "XBuffy" CirculateSkip
Style "*lock" CirculateSkip
Style "XSession" CirculateSkip
Style "XConsole" CirculateSkip

AddToFunc page-and-warp "I" GotoPage $0 $1
+ "I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus

AddToFunc desk-and-warp "I" Desk $0 $1
+ "I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus

The CirculateSkip Styles ensure that only "important" windows get the
focus.

Hope this helps,

I have a microsoft Natural keyboad, and would like to bind the window keys 
under X11.  Is this possible?  I have the following information from xev.
Any ideas?  I would like to at least bind the windows keys to the different 
menus for fvwm.  Note that neither of these keys is defined in 
/usr/include/X11/xkeysyms.def  anyone know how to define new keys?

Please do, using Fvwm with Sun tools is riddled with little annonying problems.
I presume that the patch will help with this.

Use xmodmap to rebind the keycodes for those special keys to keysyms
that exist.  Then in your .fvwmrc, provide bindings to modules,
functions, or actions for those keysyms.

Hi fvwm-users,

I'm hoping that I'm not the only one who uses the /opt approach to
installing non-system software, and that someone has already
encountered and conquered this problem.

I'm trying to install fvwm in the directory /opt/fvwm-1.24r , ie:
under this directory is a bin, and man page, and then links are made
into /usr/local/ - this approach greatly reduces the effort required
to maintain such packages, especially when removing old versions.
Anyway, I've successfully compiled fvwm several times now, only to
realise that paths like /usr/X11/bin and /usr/man are hard coded in
the Makefiles (produced by imake).

Does anyone know how to twist things so that the hard coded paths are
/opt/fvwm etc?? I don't feel like manually reqriting all the
makefiles.

thanks in advance,

Steve

This is similar to an AutoFocus idea I had.  I think it would be nice
if an AutoFocus module would change focus to the largest window when
switching pages/desktops.  It's sorta silly to move to a new page with
only one window and have to manually adjust the focus.

I'll preface by apologizing for asking what is surely a dumb question.

I'm building the latest beta version of FVWM2 on hpux9 and I'm getting a missing 
library error. Specifically, it's looking for libV3.a (that's what I think it's 
called.. the link line has -lV3 defined). I've never heard of this before and I 
don't know what it's in reference to. I can't find this library in any of the usual 
lib directories. Can anyone help, or point me to the source so I can build this 
library myself?

thanks-
Deryl

I put mine in /Applications/fvwm (way non-standard, I know, but it's a =

appropriate paths(I think it is included by imake).

I can email you more info when I go home later, if you need it.

I'm trying to do this now.

In my .fvwmrc the Left ALT key combined with the F1 key pops up the menu.  I'd 
like to bind the Left Window key which has a keycode of 115 (as Ted found 
using xev).

Having read the man page on xmodmap, it seems I need to bind the keycode 115 
to the keysyms of both the "Left ALT" and "F1" keys.

In /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, exist the lines:
	#define XK_F1                   0xFFBE
	#define XK_Alt_L                0xFFE9  /* Left alt */

So I'm trying to execute this:

	xmodmap -ev "keycode 115 = 0xFFEA 0xFFBE"

alas, (because I'm clueless) this doesn't do anything.

Anyone have any ideas?

First thing to be said: I haven't actually used fvwm yet - so if this
feature exists already - please be kind and simply tell me so - if
not, maybe this is food for thought...

There are many different ways to set the focus on windows,
unfortunately, most people only know about the mouse - which leaves me
a little in the dark, because the other methods tend to be sparsely
explored (under-developed). Till now I've been using mwm - and I've
been able to jump between windows by binding keystrokes with the
f.next_key / f.prev_key functions. This works just great, as long as
the windows are stacked properly, then I can go to the window to the
right by pressing <WM><right>, and vise-versa. This breaks down
however when the windows are out of order, then pressing <WM><right>
suddenly warps my focus to the left, or to the clock, xbiff or xload.
(I can use the mouse to bring the windows into the right order, but
that's a pain compared to the single keystroke option)

It would be REALLY nice to have a visually based warping function, so
that you could jump to the "next window to the right" - or perhaps you
could define a circular function, so you could warp in a clockwise or
anti-clockwise direction.

how this relates to multiple desktops, I don't know (never needed them).

just my few cents worth :-)

PS: my <WM> key is simply a remapped otherwise useless Caps_Lock key :-)

There is a 'CursorMove' function.  I have the following defined:

# press arrow + control key, and move the pointer by 1/3 of a page
Key Left        A       C       CursorMove -33 +0
Key Right       A       C       CursorMove +33 +0
Key Up          A       C       CursorMove +0   -33
Key Down        A       C       CursorMove +0   +33


The things we'll do to avoid reaching over to that mouse...

Here's some progress in trying to bind the Microsoft Keyboard left window key 
to Fvwm's menu.
As I'm not in Japan, I can use the Japanese keysms without consequence.

The following binds the ms$ left window key to the Kanji keysym

	xmodmap -ev "keycode 115 = 0xFF21"

In .fvwmrc this binds the Kanji keysym + my Left ALT key to the menu

	Key Kanji       A       M       Popup "Utilities"
 
I'd like to call up the menu with just one key, but if I leave out the "M" in 
the above line, ONLY the FVWM Modules menu pops up for me. -- is this a 
feature?  

Can I call up the main menu (Utilities on my system) with just one key??

Thank you,
Eric.

I did precisely the same thing in my .fvwm2rc file.  It is an ugly
hack, though, as everything gets crazy when I create more than one 
window in a screen.  I think fvwm should restore the focus on the
window that previously had it in the screen we are switching to.

I think what you really want to do is bind the keycode 115 to just any
random keysym ... but one you're not already using.  Try:

	xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = sterling"

which will make that key send the keysym for Pounds Sterling, which
you almost definitely don't have anywhere else on your keyboard.

Then, in your .fvwmrc, use ``Key sterling <args...>'' to have that key
activate whatever you want.

Yes, use xkeycaps(1) by Jamie Zawinski. It cures hair loss caused by
xmodmap.

Xkeycaps(1) gives you a simple GUI to xmodmap that lets you fiddle
with your keyboard to your hearts content.

If you don't have it on your system, I heartily recommend getting it
from

	ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/xkeycaps-2.29.tar.Z

or one of its mirrors, or from the wizard himself:

Sometimes I should sit tight before posting to mailing lists.  I usually find 
an answer if I tinker long enough.  I'm sorry for the multiposts, but this 
post will probably be received well by those with ms$ keyboards.

The following binds the ms$ left window key to the Kanji keysym.  Any keysym 
will do (though it should be unused by your system -- look at keysymdef.h) as 
long as the same names are used on the command line and  in .fvwmrc. 
 
 	xmodmap -ev "keycode 115 = Kanji"
 
Then the following line allows the left window key (without having to press 
any other keys) to call up the menu Utilities (main menu on my system).
 
 	Key Kanji       A       A       Popup "Utilities"


Sean, Mark, and Ted,
	Thanks for the help, I've wanted to be able to do this since I got this 
keyboard last summer.


Cheers,
Eric.

You wanted:

You can bind to all three of the keys on the MSWin keyboard, I used to
have all three keys bound to menus and if I remember correctly the
keycodes were consecutive... if it is of any help you may actually
want to use a high function key, I had them bound to (from left to
right) F33, F34 and F35.  You might want one of the keys to start the
WindowList...  In addition to xkeycaps also man xev which also helps
debugging keycodes.

PS. Also I had Alt-Space bound to give the popup window menu.

Subject: FVWM: Fvwm PixmapButton Patch
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92


Hi, if anyone is interested to test this out I am posting it here.  It
is a patch to allow one to put a pixmap file on an Fvwm button.  It
centers [small] pixmaps, supports transparency and a different pixmap
for the "down" state.  See the patched Fvwm.tmpl file near -DSHAPE for
more info on how to use it.  It also should be backward compatible
with the original ButtonStyle directive.

I tried it on a few platforms but was having at one point having some
seemingly odd problems on AIX (3.2, not sure if it was because of the
local setup, but under different compiling circumstances,
e.g. compiling _with_ -g it worked) so if anyone wants to try it
please test it with care (please report problems here; patches against
fvwm-2.0.41):

I'm reporting this since I don't see any mention of it in the 1996 fvwm list
archives:

    + FVWM_SRCDIR = ..
      #include "../Fvwm.tmpl"
      
      SRCS = \

			+	+	+

There's also a slight problem with the special Fvwm{Module,Program}Target rules
in Fvwm.tmpl because of the explicit use of $(CC) for linking, which overrides
the $(CCLINK) linking rule that X11R6 imake (at least) uses to provide default
runpath directories for the runtime linker.  That probably doesn't make much
sense, so... compare these two targets in $FVWM_ROOT/fvwm/Makefile:

v2.0.40
-------
  fvwm: $(OBJS) $(DEPLIBS)
        $(RM) $@
        $(CCLINK) -o $@ $(LDOPTIONS) $(OBJS) $(LOCAL_LIBRARIES) $(LDLIBS)  $(EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS)

v2.0.41
-------
  fvwm2: $(OBJS) $(DEPLIBS)
        $(RM) $@
        $(CC) -o $@ $(OBJS) $(LDOPTIONS) $(LOCAL_LIBRARIES) $(LDLIBS) $(EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS)

A quick-and-dirty fix is trivial for my purposes, but hopefully someone with
more understanding of the special rules in Fvwm.tmpl, imake, etc. can provide
a generalized patch.  I run Solaris 2.5, OpenWindows 3.5 Xsun server, alot of
X11R6-built apps, gcc 2.7.2.

Anyway, it's great to be able to compile a working fvwm2 with the only changes
made to Fvwm.tmpl.  Thanks!

While hard at work with rewriting FvwmButtons, I finally got so annoyed with
the long lines it needed in .fvwmrc (just you wait and see!), I took the 
liberty to make a sorely needed patch for fvwm itself. (Wowee!)

This patch allows any lines in .fvwmrc to be continued by ending it with a
backslash. (Note that even comments will be continued like this! Complaints?)

Example 1: (somewhat sick)

Pi\
xmapPa\
th /usr/\
include/X11/pixmaps

Example 2: (from the current under-development FvwmButtons)

*FvwmButtons(font "fixed",2x1,frame 3,padding 10 0)\
	- - Swallow "xping" \
	Exec xping -title ebone.net -bg gray45 -fg black -geometry -1500-1500\
	-h stockholm-ebs.ebone.net -n &

Simply apply the patch below in the fvwm-2.0.41/fvwm directory.

Almost forgot: There's a more uptodate FvwmButtons on my homepage, not to be
used if you don't like bughunts. It's shaky, to say the least. But the features
in example 2 above works, and most of the rewriting needed to do the _real_
upgrades is done. However, I expect to get real nervous about my diploma to
be delivered in one month soon, so I don't know how active I'll be onwards.
Anyway, the address is http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm

On my HPUX (A.09.03) it's in /usr/lib:

MEDP> l /usr/lib/*V*
-r--r--r--   1 bin      bin        11612 Sep 23  1993 /usr/lib/libV3.a
-r--r--r--   9 bin      bin         1732 Sep 23  1993 /usr/lib/libV7.a

May be it's part of an option for HPUX. A quick look with nm reveals these
symbols:

This question is more of a general X question that an FVWM question, but 
I have heard it mentioned in discussions here that have to do with 
resizing windows....Anyway here goes:

	Is there an easy way of specifying the color window manager uses 
when resizing a window in 'rubber band' mode?? The standard is 
black....This causes a problem for me because I like to work with a solid 
black background and I can't see the 'rubber band' outline of the 
window.....I have seen SOME apps use non-black outlines but haven't been 
able to find an xdefalult or widget setting that changes this. I wasn't 
sure if it was an X setting or a windowmanager controlable option. As far 
as color goes...any thing that shows up well will work for me....

	TIA,
		Jon Watson

Hi,

you all know this little box that appears in the middle of the
screen when you (re)position or size a window.  Well, I was 
wondering whether it's possible to specify where this box will
appear.  In FVWM 1.x it was in the upper left hand corner, and
I thought that was very nice, because it didn't cause lots of
expose events on the windows.

Maybe (if it's not possible) we could add this to the TO-DO list?

Thanks,
 Andy.

PS: Please reply by private mail, since I am not on the mailing
    list anymore. (too much traffic, too much work)

It seems this is hardwired to the menu style setting: if you select menu
style to be mwm you get it centred, otherwise it's put at (0,0).

The XORvalue fvwm setting can change the way it makes the rubber
bands.  I set mine to 11 which does a pretty good job of making the
rubberband visible on all my windows no matter what background they
have.  You can experiment with different values until you find one you
like.

If you start an application on a different desktop than you are
currently sitting at, the default behavior will warp to that desktop
when its window maps.  By setting the SkipMapping style for that
window, the window is created on the other desktop, but you don't see
it until you actually go to it.  It's great at startup time when I'm
putting MAE on desk 1, Netscape on desk 2 and all my other stuff is
coming up on desk 0.

That's what I thought it did, but I felt like asking.  I've been wanting
fvwm to do this for months now.  Thanks.

This really does reflect poorly on the documentation, though.  I've been
using fvwm for quite some time, hacked the source code, made patches,
etc.  But there are features buried in here that even experienced users
don't recognize.

I realize the documentation is 3000x better than it used to be.

I guess all we can do is flag this to be documented.  I, personally,
wouldn't mind seeing a manpage just on Fvwm's style hints.

Hi,

I am using fvwm 2.0.40  and DEC Alpha 200 4/166 (OSF V3.2C). 

I have one problem: when my mouse is in the root window area, if I press right
mouse button, the screen is freezed. Then I have to telnet in and kill the 
window manager. 

Could someone out there tell me if this is a bug of fvwm or something I can
avoid it?

Thanks,

David

Correct.  In fact, I encourage this very highly.  Before fvwm2 can be
officially released, the docs and install process need to be pretty
clean and correct, which is what I've been trying to improve on
lately.

When you encounter missing or incorrect things, definitely inform me
please.  I'll try to update the docs for the following release.

It probably won't get it's own man page, but I would like to make sure
that all of the options are at least touched on slightly and get
improved over time.

Actually, this is an fvwm question and not a general X question, since
it is the window manager that draws these outlines.

RTFM - from the fvwm2.man page:

          XORvalue number
               Changes the value with which bits are XOR'ed when doing
               rubber-band window moving or resizing.  Setting this
               value is a trial-and-error process.


So, you could try setting this in your .fvwm2rc to see if it helps.
Here's what I have and it works ok for me with my solid black
background too:

                              XORValue 1

But then, the default value of 255 works for me ok too, so I don't
know if it'll help you or not.

I'm also a little confused as to why it's different for some apps
during the same session...

I didn't mean that as a slam to you at all.  In fact, I think you and
the other coders do an outstanding job.  I just feel like the
documentation is a little "holesome" of ya' know what I mean.

I almost feel like someone should volunteer just to work on the
documentation.  I would be willing to do that, but I'm afraid I don't
have the time.

If someone could take the documentation off your hands, this solve both
problems.  There would be time to get the documentation done, and
it could be expanded upon to better describe all of the features.

Well, if anyone out there sends me doc updates, that is as valuable as
a patch and I'll get them incorporated.  But I'm not looking for
anyone to take over the docs wholesale.  Once this initial problem of
getting them up to date is taken care of, updates shouldn't be to bad.
Being the maintainer of the source now, this really is my
responsibility as well, since the source and docs should go hand and
hand.

On a related note, if anyone contributes patches, I'd really
appreciate the relative doc updates (or an approximation thereof) to
be sent with them if needed and at all possible.

ho,

the following has been a problem ever since i used fvwm (2.0.3x-2.0.41).
(SunOS 5.4, Generic July 1994, Sparc 1000)

i have xlock bound to a button in fvwmbutons:

   *FvwmButtons - lock.xpm Exec "" exec xlock -mode random 

i also have it as a menu item in my standard menu:

   + "XLock%mini.lock.xpm%" Exec nice /usr/openwin/bin/xlock -mode flame

which is actually copied from one of the .fvwmrc posted to this list 
so i guess it worked there. in my .cshrc i have set:

   alias xlock "xlock -mode random"

and this works fine whenever i call it from an xterm.
however, if i use either the button or the menu to call 
xlock i get the following on stderr:

   xlock: can't get the user password. Exiting ...
          You need to run xlock in setuid root mode on your local machine.
          Contact your system administrator.

but the permissions are as follows:

   (sorg) ~ % ls -l /usr/openwin/bin/xlock
   -rwsrwxr-x  1 root        87808 Jun 24  1994 /usr/openwin/bin/xlock*

any ideas??

about another bug/feature i reported earlier (but got no response):

whenever i move an icon in fvwmbuttons with the middle mousebutton
the module (fvwmbuttons) crashes. the following is from stderr:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  12 (X_ConfigureWindow)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  3972
  Current serial number in output stream:  3973
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)

  Resource id in failed request:  0x180000a
  Serial number of failed request:  686
  Current serial number in output stream:  707
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62 (X_CopyArea)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800015
  Serial number of failed request:  1904
  Current serial number in output stream:  1908
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)

  Resource id in failed request:  0x200000a
  Serial number of failed request:  634
  Current serial number in output stream:  641

this may not all be related to the module crash as i tend to get
really a lot of these failed requests during any fvwm session.

what i'd like to know is: am i the only one seeing this or does this 
happen with all fvwmbuttons?

It doesn't.  If I have two windows in a Screen, every time I switch to
that screen, the Prev window in that Screen will get the focus.  It is
really annoying.  A somehow better solution is to use this:

AddToFunc GotoPageFocus
+	"I"	GotoPage $0 $1
+	"I"	Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
+	"I"	Prev [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus

but is is much slower (I have a very old & slow video card) and the
fact that I have to set the focus first on the Prev window and then on
the Next window is visible.  I guess it would be nice to be able to do
something like:

AddToFunc GotoPageFocus
+	"I"	GotoPage $0 $1
+	"I"	Current [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
		^^^^^^^

Tudor

P.S.
With or without this, fvwm is just great :-)

I have had the same experience with fvwm locking when I clicked the
right mouse button on the root window area.  fvwm 2.0.41 seems to have
fixed this for me, too.

  I think this is not absolutely correct, and that it depends on the
  position on the screen of each set of windows, i.e one can get the
  desired or undesired effect, depending on where the windows are. 

  For a neat undesirable trick, place a window in such a way that it
  straddles two workspaces and try switching between them.  In some
  situations you can end up in the same workspace you started from,
  courtesy of Focus!

P.S.:
  It's amazing how one comes up with almost the same solutions as everyone
  else. My functions even had very similar names, i.e. GoToPageAndFocus
  instead of GoToPage.
