Yes, it's Openwindows.

uname -a
SunOS name 5.6 Generic_105181-16 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

gcc -v
Reading specs from
/tools/gnu/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5/2.7.2pl6/specs
gcc version 2.7.2 (patchlevel 6 compiled on Jul 15 1996, 09:40:42)

So it seems gcc is compiled for solaris 2.5 and I'm using 2.6.
/tools/gcc is a symlink to /tools/gcc-2.7.2pl6, but there is also a
directory
/tools/gcc-2.95.3-5.6.

How do I tell configure to use this version?

You may either change your PATH so another gcc is current or export CC
to point to a correct executable, like:

  env CC=/tools/gcc-2.95.3-5.6/bin/gcc ./configure [configure-params]

This should be enough if your gcc-2.95.3-5.6 is installed correctly.
Also remove config.cache, so configure forgets the previously found gcc.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello Mikhael,

reading the configure script I realized to set CC, but of course I
didn't know to remove
config.cache.
Now it works :-)

Thanks to you and the newsgroup.
regards
Thomas

WORK AT HOME USING YOUR COMPUTER!!! 
_________________________________________________________________ Dear Friend, You can earn 
$46,000 or more in next the 90 days sending e-mail. Seem impossible? Read on for details (no, 
there is no "catch")... _________________________________________________________________ "AS 
SEEN ON NATIONAL TV" Thank you for your time and Interest. This is the letter you've been reading 
about in the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a major nightly 
news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below, 
to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program 
was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are, absolutely no laws prohibiting 
the participation in the program. This has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless 
and fun way to make some extra money at home. The results of this show has been truly remarkable. 
So many people are participating that those involved are doing, much better than ever before. 
Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of 
lately. You will understand once you experience it. "HERE IT IS BELOW" 
_________________________________________________________________________ *** Print This Now For 
Future Reference *** The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a 
look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $46,000 
in less than 90 days! Please read the enclosed program...THEN READ IT AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING 
OPPORTUNITY. It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best 
of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail. If you believe that someday 
you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, THIS IS IT! Simply follow the 
instructions, and your dreams will come true. This multi-level e-mail order marketing program 
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME. Email is the sales tool of the future. Take advantage of this 
non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!! The longer you wait, the more people will be 
doing business using e-mail. Get your piece of this action!!! MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has 
finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both 
Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods 
and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's. This is a 
Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000 millionaires in the WORLD, 20% ( 700,000) made 
their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people 
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You may have heard this story before, 
but over the summer Donald Trump (A MULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) 
made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost 
everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a 
good network marketing company and get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He 
looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response "That's why I'm sitting up here and you 
are all sitting out there!" With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct 
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce 
to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time or money 
once and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid 
for the work of others. This program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different 
countries across the world. The enclosed INF0RMATION is something I almost let slip through my 
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it. 
My name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years 
down-sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open 
my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my 
family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I 
just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my 
family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am 
writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! 
In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program 
I had been sending away for INF0RMATION on various business opportunities. All of the programs I 
received, in my opinion, were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to 
comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or 
not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year...it didn't tell me I'd have to 
write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I 
didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR 
THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't 
believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, 
without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would 
at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little 
worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the US Post Office 
(1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program 
was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "WHY NOT." Initially I sent out 100,000 e-mails. It 
cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any 
money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are fulfilled via 
e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you off, 
but I promised myself that I would not "rip-off" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. In 
less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By January 13, I had received 
26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to "RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 
WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!" My first step in making $46,000 in 90 
days was done. By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to "RECEIVE 
AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 
ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $46,000 GOAL." Well, I had 
196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my 
e-mailing of 100,000, I received $42,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts 
and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE 
YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you 
must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different 
place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work, you 
must meet your goal of 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make 
$46,000 or more in 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate 
in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If 
you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. 
If you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like I was, or you want to start 
your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! Sincerely, Johnathon Rourke 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read the enclosed 
program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could 
not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable 
business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things 
that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It 
wasn't me, it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had 
been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate... 
because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies 
than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested 
wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who never had anything to save or invest, 
were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE 
POOR GET POORER." The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "move up" or 
"get rich", inflation will see to that. You have just received INF0RMATION that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT." 
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. I should also point 
out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for 
this program. I have already made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS! I have retired from the program after 
sending out over 1,600,000 programs. Now I have several offices that make this and several other 
programs here and over seas. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any 
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to 
everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more...and 
your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential 
customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! "THINK ABOUT IT" Before you 
delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY 
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out 
the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of 
money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your 
first orders come in. IT WORKS! Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL 
MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ INSTRUCTIONS: This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% 
EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $46,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you 
say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly 
legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multi-level 
businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Because of 
the global nature of the internet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business partners 
from all over the world, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL 
AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in 
your own home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere. 
This is what you MUST do: 1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below(you can't sell them if 
you don't order them). a. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU 
ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the 
person whose name appears on the list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! b. When you place your order, make sure you order 
each of the five reports. You will need all five reports so that you can save them on your 
computer and resell them. c. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five 
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you. 2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are 
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed 
below in steps "a" through "g" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you 
understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, 
this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing 
of available reports. b. After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and 
REM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no 
doubt counting their $46,000! Also, change the name of the company, the address, and the REM0VE 
e-mail address on the top of this document to your own. c. Move the name and address under REPORT 
#4 down to REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e. Move the 
name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 
down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you 
copy every name and address ACCURATELY! 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list 
of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this 
letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You 
obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing 
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable 
marketing INF0RMATION which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free 
classified ads and much, much more. In addition you will be provided with INF0RMATION on Internet 
Marketing Clubs such as INTERNET MARKETING RESOURCES(IMR): This is one the premiere internet 
marketing clubs on the INTERNET. This club provides a forum where internet marketers from all 
over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on Internet Marketing. In addition, members of this 
club are provided free internet marketing tools and services for the 
Do-Yourself-Internet-Marketer. They will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 
1,000,000 fresh e-mail addresses each week. This club will provide you with hundreds of free 
resources which include: How to obtain free web sites, how to obtain top rankings in search 
engines for your web-site, how to send bulk e-mail into AOL and CompuServe, how to market your 
products on newsgroups, free classified ads, electronic malls, bulletin boards, banner ads and 
much more. There are two primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK 
E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you 
and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing 
receives a 0.3% response. Using a good list the response could be much better. Also, many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this 
example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.3% response, that is only 6 orders for REPORT 
#1. Those 6 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 12,000. Out of those 
0.3%, 36 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 
72,000. The 0.3% response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3. Those 216 send out 2,000 programs 
each for a 432,000 total. The 0.3% response to that is 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. Those 1,296 
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,592,000 total. The 0.3% response to that is 7,776 orders for 
REPORT #5. That's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this example is$30 + $180 
+ $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT 
OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK 
FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. 
Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to participate in this 
is practically nothing. You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! 
REPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing, tell you where to obtain free 
bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists and show you how to send out 1,000,000 
e-mails for free. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 1. Advertising on the 'Net is 
very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide 
to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 6 people to 
participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a 
larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline 
members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below. 1st level--your 6 members 
with $5 ($5 x 6).......................$30 2nd level--6 members from those 6 ($5 x 
36)...................$180 3rd level--6 members from those 36 ($5 x 216)............ $1,080 4th 
level--6 members from those 216 ($5 x 1,296)........ $6,480 5th level-6 members from those 1,296 
($5 x 7,776)... .$38,880 
.....................................................................................$46,650 
_________________________________________________________________________ Remember friends, this 
assumes that the people who participate only recruit 6 people each. Think for a moment what would 
happen if they got 20 people to participate! Many people will get 100's of participants! THINK 
ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. 
THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail 
THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise 
until they receive the report! 
_________________________________________________________________________ AVAILABLE REPORTS

There currently more than 175,000,000 people on-line worldwide! ******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* 
* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * 
Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in 
because: When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. * ALWAYS 
PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. * Be patient and persistent with this 
program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! * ABOVE ALL, 
HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow 
these guidelines to guarantee your success: If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within 
two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later 
you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or 
sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS 
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are 
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue 
placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate 
from this business! Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this 
program. Please answer one question. DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, 
please look at the following facts about this program: 1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES 
NOT COST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE! 2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 
3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO ADVERTISE! 4. YOU ARE UTILIZING 
THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL 
OVER THE WORLD! 5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS YOUR TIME! 6. 
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! ******* T E S T I M O 
N I A L S ******* This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of 
not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of 
potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make 
relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the 
program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New 
Zealand My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant 
with a major US Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled 
to Jody about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the 
population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed 
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the 
old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two 
weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 
bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a 
believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby." I did have seven more years until retirement, 
but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. Mitchell Wolf MD., 
Chicago, IL The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, 
lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was 
approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in 
return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in 
the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. Sincerely yours, Pam Hedland Halmstad, Sweden Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. 
But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was 
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I surprised when I 
found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I 
had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years 
of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. 
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a 
try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was 
e-mailed another program, ..11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made 
more than $41,000 on the first try!! Mohamed, Cairo, Egypt This is my third time to participate 
in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the 
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. 
For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and 
happy spending! Sam Lee Suva, Fiji Islands ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD

I use the following setup:

Key KP_Insert   A A GotoPage prev
Key Tab         A       M       Next (CurrentPage !Iconic) MyFocus


So, when I press KP_Insert i goes to the prev page.
But, pressing Alt-Tab sets the prev page to current and KP_Insert goes
nowhere. Is it intended or not?

Is it possible for Next to not change the `prev' page if it has CurrentPage
flag?

Hi,

I'll put it in the list since it seems to be essencial...

> HTH,

Thanks for your help, but it didn't help ;)

The Problem is NOT that I press Numlock ( or whatever ) and nothing works 
anymore...

But it is, that different things work/ dont work , depending on the Numlock 
status.

If I disable the Modifiers, using 
xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

I cant't change the Numlock status and the situation is even worse, since I 
can only move a window, but not open a menu :(

With version 2.2.4 nothing worked with Numlock pressed, and everyting worked 
with Numlock not pressed...

I don't think there is much much difference in the way numlock works
with the 2 releases.
Perhaps you should check your config file and see what modifiers
you are using for the Mouse-Menu and moving windows.

They both work for me with numlock on or off.

Perhaps you want to change the "N" (no modifier),
to "A" (any modifier).

You can also look at the IgnoreModifiers command which is new
in the 2.3.x series.

I tried the IgnoreModifiers command, and Menus now work fine everywhere. But 
moving windows still wont.

BUT : Everything that is not working is defined by Functions (see 
"MoveOrRaise" above (and below):

AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
 +	"Click"	Raise 
 +	"Motion"	Raise 
 +	"Motion"	Move 
 +	"DoubleClick"	Lower 

# end function MoveOrRaise

Has the Syntax changed somehow ?

Hi !

It works now.  I overread the lines 
BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS
       The following commands are built-in to fvwm:

            Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
            Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
            Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
            Key Escape A MC EscapeFunc
            Mouse 1 TS A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move
            Mouse 1 F  A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Resize
            AddToFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX I Raise

in the manpage (rtfm) ;)

Erased/changes my calls to the functions and now it works. Thanks for all 
your Help :)

You should get the message on your standard error: [FVWM][AddToFunction]:
<<ERROR>> Got 'Click' instead of a valid function specifier

The man page suggests to use M, H, C and D letters for specifiers.
I am not sure whether we should support the old syntax ("Click", "Motion").
In 2.2 versions even word "Close" would pass as "Click", now it does not.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, using more than a single letter was never officially
supported, but many config files had it in the past.  I can't
remember when or why this was changed, but it probably happened by
accident.

That is fixed in the next beta release or tomorrow's snapshot.

hi list!

i am using several xterms which have this active-icon-feature enabled.
usually, icons are not sticky, so they'll stay where i iconized them.
but sometimes, when compiling stuff or watching logfiles, it would be
nice to have the icon sticky on all desks/viewports. 

i already have the "sticky" command configured to be used via keyboard
shortcut, but this makes the whole window sticky - which is not what i
want. i'd like to have something like "StickyIcon" as a command.

shall i do this via styles? this is not very comfortable for it's
limited to a window class (which is also not what i want: i'd like to
have it for one specific window!).

does anybody know how to do this? or am i asking too much [1]?

i'm using 2.3.31 from cvs. it's a quite recent build.

thank you in advance!

andrй

[1] hah! the more features i get, the more i come to such weird ideas!
fvwm2 is just too configurable ;)

This can only be done as a style right now.  If the window does
not have a unique name/icon name/class or resource (or you can
give it a unique name) you are out of luck.

If there ever is a 3.0 release, tying styles to individual windows
will be one of the major features.

No, it *isn't*.  Actually it's not flexible enough.  Otherwise
people would not keep asking for new features of this kind :-)

ey, come on! you dev'ping guys did great work, you know that! and all of
this for free (which means: for us). you don't have to launch
google-keyword-cheating-search-promos to spread one of the most flexible
windowmanagers all over the world. if i need something slim an lean, i
take fvwm2. if i need something big'n fat, i take fvwm2 too! that's my
opinion (for several years now).

so don't underestimate your work.

yours

I used to use SloppyFocus policy but today I decide to play with
ClickToFocus. I have a problem when switching to another page using
GotoPage command -- focus remains on last window. 

Is it possible to focus a
window on current page automatically?

You can either use desks instead of pages.  Each desk has its own
focused window and since recently keeping this window active
really works.  Or you can make a function:

  AddToFunc GotoPageAndFocus
  + I GotoPage $0 $1
  + I Next (CurrentPage) Focus

Then use this function instead of GotoPage everywhere.  However,
this does not work when scrolling the viewport or dragging windows
over the screen edge.  And if the pointer lands on a window (for
SloppyFocus or MouseFocus), the window may not gain focus.

Thanks, it works, albeit not perfectly.

I'd better go back to SloppyFocus. ;-)

I use the following setup:

Style "*" BorderWidth 2, SloppyFocus

AddToFunc MyFocus 
+ "I" WindowId $w Raise
+ "I" WindowId $w FlipFocus

AddToFunc GotoPageAndFocus
+ I GotoPage $0 $1
+ I Next (CurrentPage) MyFocus


When there is exactly one window on a page it works perfectly -- that window
got the focus even if cursor not over it. OK.  Things goes badly when there
is more then one window on a page.  For example, if page 2 has three windows
on it they get selected in order when I switch to this page:
w1,w2,w3,w1, etc.

I want the same window to got the focus every time I switch to that page.
I 've tried 
+ I Next (CurrentPage Visible) MyFocus
+ I Next (CurrentPage Raised) MyFocus

but that doesn't work. Is it possible to do?

Hello !

How can I find out a windows name (needed for a style) if its not obvious? 
For example I never managed to find out the name for kmail which is why I 
wasn't able to use some helpful tips from the list...

Hi,

	Maybe I'm coming too late :-), but I have a tip for those of you who are 
looking for the standart Alt+Tab behavior in Fvwm. I mean switching between 
the various running programs....

	This line on .fvwm2rc do the trick. Note that the alt+tab are tied to 
winlist but  you can override this (at least with the last beta version... 
the one that I'm using :-) ).

Key Tab         A       M       Next [*] Focus

	You can go further and  use shift+alt+tab to switching in the reverse order:

key Tab         A       SM      Prev [*] Focus 

	But you can do some other tricks too... the [*] are used to define what 
Styles the Fvwm will look for when switching programs, so you can use keys to 
circulate between a group of windows.  Here I use Crtl+tab to circulate 
between my E-terms:

key Tab         A       C       Next [Eterm*] Focus


	May I sugest to include this on the FAQ?

I myself prefer the default behaviour of Alt-Tab in 2.3.x, because it does
not immediately jump to a random (almost) window, like in your example. :)

I think that if we are going to add something like this to FAQ we should
use round brackets, not obsolete square brackets. Also most of users would
probably want to call a user function here, like:

  Next (*, !Iconic, CurrentDesk) SelectWindow

so they would do more useful things in SelectWindow than just focusing,
for example, wrapping a cursor to a window center, raising, unshading.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK.  I've been through the FAQ...forward, backward, and sideways
in an attempt to spare the list.  And what I found in the FAQ will
not work for me.

Specifically, I cannot get answer 3.18 to do what I want.  Here's
the example given in 3.18:

     DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
     *FvwmEvent add_window SetGeometryForMyWindow

     DestroyFunc SetGeometryForMyWindow
     AddToFunc   SetGeometryForMyWindow
     + I Next ("My Window") Move +10p +10p
     + I Next ("My Window") Resize 100p 200p

     AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent

What I want is to warp the focus to a specific new window when it
pops up (say, the "Netscape: Find" window).  I attempt to do this
(in version 2.2.5) by:

     DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
     *FvwmEvent add_window WarpToFind

     DestroyFunc WarpToFind
     AddToFunc   WarpToFind
     + I Next ("My Window") Focus
     + I Next ("My Window") WarpToWindow 50 33

     AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent

This doesn't work.  WHY?

BTW, I've also tried replacing "add_window" with other events
such as "raise_window" and "deiconify".  No luck.  I've also
tried replacing "Next" with "WindowId $0".  No luck.

If you can, please help.

Did you replace "My Window" with "Netscape: Find"? If I do this, it
works for me.

Sorry.  Yes.  I did that.  (In my copy paste haste [from the example
into the email], I hand-editted it to match my .fvwm2rc...and missed
changing "My Window".)

The following does NOT work for me:

   DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
   *FvwmEvent add_window WarpToFind

   DestroyFunc WarpToFind
   AddToFunc   WarpToFind
   + I Next ("Netscape: Find") Focus
   + I Next ("Netscape: Find") WarpToWindow 50 33

   AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent

NOTHING happens.  When "Netscape: Find" appears, it simply pops
up wherever it was last located, but the cursor doesn't move,
and focus does not change.  (I'm using FocusFollowsMouse.)

What version of fvwm are you using?  (Again, I'm using 2.2.5.)

I'm running fvwm2 2.2.4 on HP-UX B.10.20.
We're currently evaluating Rational RoseRT as a development tool and I've
been playing with this tool for 2 weeks now. I can't remember when I was
so frustrated by a tool. Most people here use CDE, but I use fvwm2 and
sloppyfocus or should I say I have used it. Can't get fvwm2 to deal with
the RoseRT window(s).
I'm experiencing similar problems to what Neil Bird reported last October.
   Subject: Windows-alike override-redirect issue A
   From: Neil Bird <neil.bird@rdel.co.uk>
i.e. 
 - RoseRT window always stays on top
 - icon box is ignored
 - icon stays on top for a while and than all of a sudden is lowered (haven't
   figured out why) and I can't get it back to top
 - no usual frame, title etc.

in FAQ and in the message archive I found a note that setting either
  export MWWM=allwm
or
  export MWWM=MWM
should do the trick. But nothing changes at all.

So I'm trying to figure out the differences between his setup and mine.
I work under HP-UX and have an older fvwm version and there's one more
thing that may cause trouble: I have to start fvwm2 from a CDE session.

Appreciate any help and pointers.

Thanx Klaus

I'm using 2.2.4, what you write works for me, both with SloppyFocus
and with FocusFollowsMouse. I find this strange...

Have you verified that MWWM really did get exported.  CDE doesn't
normally run your .profile.

Create an xterm/dtterm window from the Fvwm menus.  Inside the window
see what

echo $MWWM

displays.

Very!  :^)

Perhaps it's netscape.  I'm using 4.77.  And you?  (Let's see
how far we can take this...  :^)

Most likely the window title does not match.  There may be
invisible spaces.  Use FvwmIdent to find to get the window's
resource and use that instead.  If this still does not help,
verify that the function is called at all by adding

  AddToFunc WarpToFind I Beep

FvwmEvent may not be running.  Are there any error messages on the
sonsole?

I used the Desktop Switching Tool in GNOME (Default RH6.2 install) to switch
to FVWM. When I try to switch back to GNOME, well, it doesn't. Any help of
how I can get back to GNOME would be appreciated.

Hi,
  I am a Linux newbie so I don't know much <g>. I am running fvwm 2.3
under Red Hat 7.0. I downloaded the package of themes from fvwm.org
and don't know how to make fvwm use them. Any pointers?

Thanks,
River

If you refer to the rpm package, the documentation may be found in
/usr/share/doc/fvwm-themes-0.4.2/ directory.

You should start /usr/bin/fvwm-themes-start instead of /usr/bin/fvwm2.

Mikhael.

Yes I made sure that MWWM is set, tried both suggested values (allwm and MWM).
When I start an xterm as you suggested, MWWM is set.
To make sure that MWWM is set, I did set it in my .profile and also
in my sessionsetc. I've also set DTSOURCEPROFILE=true to source my
.profile.
I also stopped fvwm2 and started it anew from an xterm and than that damn
RoseRT. Made no difference.

Is it possible that is has something to do with me using version 2.2.4 of
fvwm2? Should I try to locally install a newer version?

Well, you might want to try one of our recent releases with:

BugOpts ModalityIsEvil


I just checked the MainWin knowledge base again and exporting
MWWM is still supposed to work.

Maybe someone did a local mod at your site and they are unsetting
that environment variable in a startup wrapper for the application?

Why don't you find out if RationalRose support or MainWin support
is as responsive as Fvwm support, and check with them?

great idea (why didn't I think of that?). I checked and found out that the
RoseRT startup script explicitly sets MWWM to nothing. That wasn't any local
change by the way. It's in the official startup script. So maybe a note should
be added in the FAQ that the RoseRT startup script unsets this variable.
I'm going to report this to Rational and I'll follow up to this mail in case
they'll give me some useful feedback.

well they certainly can't beat the support here :-). Can't be any quicker or
better.

You really made my day. Thanx a lot.

Thats strange.  It seems to contradict what it says in their knowledge
base.   The knowledge base doesn't mention modifying their script.
I'll wait to hear from you  before I update  the FAQ.  When you
do  get back, I'd  like to identify the  script by name.  Is it really
RoseRT?  Probably the release would also be helpful.

Is there a way to control the client decoration symbols ; the "minimize", =
"Maximize", and "Close" buttons located on
the upper right hand corner of a window/dialog box.  Alternatively, is =
there a way to re-display a dialog box until the user displays the correct =
entry.

What I would like to do within a FVWM Script is to display a dialog box =
until the user has entered the correct input.
When the user tries to exit the dialog box, using the "x' on upper right =
hand corner, an invalid entry mesage is displayed and the main menu =
appears gain. This repeats (loops) until the user select one of two =
entries.

Thanks in advance....

I  think you might be able   to do this with   MwmDecor (check the man
page), if you can get the application to set the appropriate Mwm decor
hints.

You may simply wrap your dialog into a while loop, something like:

  while test "`xmessage -buttons 'Yes:2,No:3' 'Correct?' -print`" == ""; do
    echo "Nothing chosen, repeating..."
  done

There is also an option to disable close and iconify buttons:

  Style xmessage NoButton 2, NoButton 6

Mikhael.

Run switchdesk from a command line, it will create for you .Xclients and
.Xclients-default files with "exec gnome-session" like its man page says.
Rename ~/.xinitrc if you have one. Rerun X. GNOME should be loaded.

Or maybe you defined fvwm as a window manager of GNOME? In this case just
go to the panel's menu settings and choose another window manager.

mkfifo() is unsupported under Cygwin, which hardly comes as a
surprise, since most special files found in Unix have no corresponding
equivalent in Win32: symlinks, hard links, fifos, block specials,
character specials... Have a look at:

http://www.cygwin.com/faq/faq_3.html#SEC18

for the entry for mkfifo().

You are perfectly right in pointing out that the FAQ mentions the
following: mkfifo: P 5.4.2.1 -- unimplemented!!!

Perhaps this problem can be solved by testing for the value of
either uname -s for CYGWIN_NT-5.0 and other values or $TERM
for cygwin in the make install script or something similar.
That way we could have a working make install under cygwin too.

Fvwm is great! Thanks!

Try doing "make -k".  Make will keep going even if there are errors.
See how much of fvwm you can build.

It is hard to answer without knowing which widget set you speak about.

Do you want to do it using a command line and external program (xmessage,
dialog) or using FVWM dialog modules (FvwmForm, FvwmScript, FvwmGtk)?
Or maybe you write a C program to display a dialog?

The same answer here. Take a look at the man page of the tool you want to
use or elaborate in the next reply to the list, not to me personally. :)

OK, try adding "-i" (ignore errors).

I'm just trying to find  out how many other problems  you are going to
encounter.  It must have already installed "fvwm2".  How does Fvwm work?

When I did a make install -k -i things seemed to run rather smoothly
and I got no errors.

Just to make sure  you understand, you  did get  errors, but  the make
process continued anyway.  The only "mkfifo" that I  see in Fvwm is in
FvwmCommand.  This module didn't get built,  or got built incorrectly.
You probably don't need this module.  I don't know if you got any other
errors, you would have to look thru all the make output to know that.

Hi there!

I've found a way to simulate the Alt-Tab behavior similar to another GUI (which does not deserve that name):

  Key Tab A M altTabSwitch

  addtofunc altTabSwitch
  + "I" Prev Raise
  + "I" Prev FlipFocus

seems to work fine (using Fvwm Version 2.2.4).
What do you think about it?

In the 2.3.x betas alt-tab using the windowlist is built in.
Its even more similar to what you are trying to emulate because
you can hold down the alt key and keep hitting tab.

Affected fvwm versions: 2.2.[45]

I invoke fvwm on my machine with the the following command:

fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc.m4"

The .xsession works out where I am, and sets an environment variable.
FvwmM4 then modifies my .fvwm2rc appropriate to the machine at which I
am actually sitting.

This works very nicely, except there seems to be a race condition which
prevents some windows being decorated with the correct styles (they get
decorated in the Fvwm default manner).

This suggests that the windows are being decorated while the FvwmM4
process is still running, and before all of the configuration file has
been parsed.  Only some windows belonging to apps launched by my
.xsession are affected, and it's not always the same windows (it
presumably depends on how busy the machine is, and so on).

If I restart the window manager using Restart fvwm2 then the windows are
decorated correctly.  It's just annoying having to do this every time I
log in.

Another workaroud is to put a sleep command for a few seconds in my
.xsession before launching fvwm, but that's just as irritating.

Has anyone else seen this behaviour before?  I haven't seen any mention
of it in the change logs.

Thanks in advance,

Tim.

Version: 2.3.31

I've read the manpage on command expansion; I want to write something 
like 

    Function CenterWindow
    + I PipeRead 'echo Current Move $(($[vp.width]/2 - $[w.width]/2)) \
                                    $(($[vp.height]/2 - $[w.height]/2))'

However, I don't know how to associate a window with the command.  
This merely tries to execute 

   echo Current Move $(( 1280/2 - $[w.width] )) $(( 960/2 - $[w.height]/2 ))

*even* if there *is* a current window (e.g., a window that is focused, 
not iconified, raised, etc.)

The example in the manpage also doesn't work, and suffers from the 
same problem (if it is a problem):

    AddToFunc PrintDeskNumber
    + I Echo $$d $[page.nx] $c

will only print something like 

    1 0 $c

again, even if there is a current window (focused, not iconified, raised, etc).

What am I getting wrong?

This depends very much on how you call this function:

 - If called from a mouse or key binding on a window it will have
   a window:

     mouse 3 T a CenterWindow
     key f3 T a CenterWindow
     # click on window title with button 3 to activate (or press f3)

 - If called from a mouse or key binding without a window it will
   not have an associated window:

     mouse 3 R a CenterWindow
     key f3 R a CenterWindow


 - If Invoked from a Read or PipeRead command it will have a window
   if the PipeRead/Read command had one. Thus,

     mouse 3 T a PipeRead "echo CenterWindow"

   will work, but

     mouse 3 R a PipeRead "echo CenterWindow"

   will not.

 - If called from FvwmConsole or FvwmConsole or most other modules
   it will *not* have a window.

     FvwmCommand "CenterWindow"
     FvwmCommand "PipeRead 'echo CenterWindow'"
     
   Will not work.

 - If called from FvwmEvent it depends on the *FvwmEventPassId
   option.

In your command line, the "Current" is inside the piperead.  Thus,
$[w.width] and $[w.height] are not defined when the shell is
called.  Therefore, the calculation can not be executed.  You have
to put "Current" before the PipeRead command:

  + I Current Piperead "echo Move \
      $(( $[vp.width]/2-$[w.width]/2 ))p \
      $(( $[vp.height]/2-$[w.height]/2 ))p"

You also have to add a 'p' at the end of the numbers to tell fvwm
to use pixels as the scale for movement.

Right, the example is incorrect.

Hi all,

I use tcsh shell settings.

After I create a whole bunch of xterms via fvwm or otherwise. I am stuck 
with a whole bunch of xterms with the same name. Is there any way I can use 
FvwmIdent, FvwmConsole, etc to change the name of the xterm to something 
relevant?? In other words, I need to dynamically change the window title!!

Thanks,

nitin

No way to do it via FVWM AFAIK, but there is a mechanism within
xterm to change the window and/or icon titles.  Details may depend
on which flavor of xterm you're using -- the one in Red Hat 6.2
documents an escape sequence which a Solaris xterm doesn't recognize
(but fortunately the Linux xterm actually accepts both sequences,
so I get by with using the Solaris escapes regardless of which type
of host the xterm is executing on).

IIRC I found the escape sequences documented in the tcsh manpage, not
the xterm manpage.  Go figure.

You can control the title during creation with:

xterm -title abc

You can change the title afterwards with the escape sequence:
^[]2;title\07

I see you use tcsh, so this  might not help,  but this is how its done
with ksh:

  function shdr	{		# changes screen title
    if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ] ; then # This makes Rumba hang, only use on xterm
      print -n '\033]2;'$*'\07'
    fi
  }

  for xterm it's fairly easy, there are some escape characters that let you
do it:

  /bin/echo "\033]2;XTERM TITLE HERE\007"

  Iam not aware of general method to change windows title though (it might
not be possible), some programs might have resources for that...

Ok I think I have a solution....

http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Xterm-Title-4.html

Although I use tcsh, the \033 and \077 didn't work, instead I had to use the 
csh solution... "]" and "^G" for ESC and BEL

It seems works now....

Thanks all,

nitin

In csh/tcsh it may be done using this alias (put it into .cshrc):

  alias set_xtitle 'printf "\033]2;\!*\007"'

A check "if ($?DISPLAY)" may be used as well if needed.

In the private message Louis said he is asking about FvwmScript module.
He also asks:

I know the answers on all 3 questions, but they are probably not full.
I prefer to wait for Olivier or someone else to answer more fully.

About warping long line:
With ItemDraw it is not possible to warp long line. To Display 3 lines
you need to use 3 ItemDraw. However, with List widget you can
display long text (by separating the lines by some |).

To capture an environment variable in a FvwmScript you can do

	Set $cmd={echo $MyEnvVar}
	Set $ScriptVar=(GetOutput $cmd 1 -1)

and your env variable will be in $ScriptVar

DestroyFunc FuncMyStartApp
AddToFunc   FuncMyStartApp
+ I FvwmScript FvwmScript-MyWaitScript $1
+ I Wait "name of FvwmScript-MyWaitScript"
+ I Exec exec $0
+ I Wait "$1"
+ All (name of FvwmScript-MyWaitScript) Delete

So now to start an app with name app_name and execution cmd
line exec_name you should execute (FVWM sense):

FuncMyStartApp "exec_name" "app_name"

We use some things like that in fvwm-themes. Also, I assume that
you use fvwm-2.3.3x, but the above works probably with 2.2.x.

I am not sure that my answers are better than if you answer. Also,
I am not sure to really understand the questions.

Hope this help. Olivier.

  I am trying to install FVWM 2.3 but am missing a library. I need
librplay.so. I went to fvwm.org and downloaded the librplay rpm but
it did not contain the library. I see the rplay daemon starting up at
boot time. What's up?

I am trying to implement a function which causes a bunch of programs
to start on different places of my 3x2 virtual screen, approx. like
that:

    +---------+----------+----------+
    |	      |+------+	 | +-------+|
    |	      ||      |	 | | 	   ||
    |	      ||      |	 | |   	   ||
    |	      |+------+	 | +-------+|
    +---------|----------+----------+
    |+--+     |	+------+ |+--------+|
    ||__|     |	|      | ||	   ||
    |  	 +---+|	+------+ ||    	   ||
    |  	 |___||	       	 |+--------+|
    +---------+----------+----------+



As two of the applications don't listen to X geometry specifictions,
which was what I first tried, I tried to let the window manager handle
this with GotoPage or StartsOnPage:
                                                                              

1  AddToFunc MyFunction
2  + "I" GotoPage 2 1
3  + "I" Exec netscape /home/florian/texte/html/learn
4  + "I" Wait "Netscape: Directory listing of /home/florian/texte/html/learn"
5  + "I" GotoPage 1 1   
6  .                                                                          
7  . 

   (line numbers for demonstration only of course)


The problem with this is that Wait seems to wait forever: the rest of
the function below line 4 is not executed. I am puzzled about what
exactly Wait is expecting. The man page states that:

	   It causes a function to pause until a new window name
	   /name/ appears. /Fvwm/ remains fully functional during a
	   wait. 

(slashes used to indicate printing in italics here). I am unsure of
whether what is meant here is the window title as displayed in the
title bar or something else. I have inquired with xprop, which gives
the following output:

WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = 
    "Netscape: Directory listing of /home/florian/texte/html/learn"
WM_NAME(STRING) = 
    "Netscape: Directory listing of /home/florian/texte/html/learn"

and with xwininfo, which outputs

xwininfo: Window id: 0x2c00464 "Netscape: Directory listing of /home/florian/texte/html/learn"

So am I specifiying the wrong string here? The Wait thing worked fine
with things like

.
.
+ "I" Exec xterm -name "SomeName"
+ "I" Wait SomeName
+ "I" GotoPage 0 1
.
.

It did not work with Netscape, Amaya and Arena.



A similar problem with StartsOnPage:

Style "Netscape*" StartsOnPage 2 1 SkipMapping
Style "Amaya*" StartsOnPage 1 0 SkipMapping
Style "Arena*" StartsOnPage 1 1 SkipMapping

This had virtually no effect (they start where they are invoked). I
*have* set

Style "*" NoPPosition


I would appreciate helpful hints a lot.

With recent versions of Fvwm I position Netscape with:

Style "Netscape" StartsOnPage 0 0 1, SkipMapping
Style "Netscape" RandomPlacement
Style "*" UsePPosition
Style "Netscape*" NoPPosition

Fvwm matches styles to windows using either Name, Class, or Resource,
as shown by FvwmIdentify.

You should always specify your fvwm version, different answers may apply
to different versions.

Well, it seems you use one of the old fvwm versions, in the current man
page only the first word is italic. :-)

Wait command only supports double quotes starting from fvwm-2.3.16, if you
use an older version remove double quotes (yes, it may look strange).

Mikhael.

I am not sure I understand the question. Do you speak about ./configure
script reporting that FVWM will not have rplay support? Or something else?

This rplay-3.3.1-1 rpm includes /usr/lib/librplay.a, which should be
enough to build FVWM with rplay support. You don't need librplay.so.

You may need to rerun ./configure (and probably remove config.cache file).
Anyway rplay support is not really needed, it is fully optional.

Mikhael.
