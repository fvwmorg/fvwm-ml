Hi,all.
I have puzzle with titlestyle ,look at my configuration.

Colorset 1 fg #333333, bg #b4d8ff,Plain,NoShape
Colorset 2 VGradient 20 rgb:51/9b/ec rgb:42/93/eb,NoShape

TitleStyle Inactive Colorset 1
TitleStyle Active   Colorset 2

TitleStyle -- Flat
TitleStyle Height 22

Colorset 2 work fine.
But in colorset 1,only "bg" work fine,the "fg" doesnot take effect.

That means,either the title bar is active or inactive,
the color of the font on it is always white.

I cannot think out how to change the default color of the font.
Help me a hand,thanks.

I means ,when the titlebar was inactive,unfocus,
How to set the label's  fore color.

This two command seems doesnot take effect.
1.
Colorset 1 fg rgb:55/56/57, bg #b4d8ff
AddTitleStyle Inactive Colorset 1 -- Flat

2
Style *         ForeColor   #404040
Style *         BackColor   #808080


As I know,when the titlebar is active,focus,
the label's color can be set like this:
Style *         HilightFore darkblue

hello all,

i'm new and i'd just like to know that when you resize or move a
window, (without the style ResizeOpaque) you get a very twmish style.
i'm wondering if there is a way to customize that kind of like
FvwmAnimate (similar to what windows desktop has) has a patch been
released to further customize the style of the "rubberband"? if not,
i'll look forward to "attempt" to release one. the fvwm code is a bit
messy for me, so i guess i'll have to do a lot of reading (to add
styles, and checking out move_resize.c)

thank you

You will have to do a lot of reading, alas.  It's currently not possible
to style the rubberband effect one has when resizing a window.

Hi all,

Does anyone know of a way to dynamically display the mouse coordinates?
Something like the little label that appears in the top-left corner
of the screen when I do a "Move". But I want it to sit there all the
time, not just when I move a window.

Perhaps there is a utility/app that does this, but I googled around &
couldn't find one.

SCoTT. :)

Hello,

My FvwmPager is only displaying mini icons for windows that were open
when fvwm was started/restarted.  New windows are always blank in the
pager, even though the mini icon is the window decor.

Has anyone run into this quirk before?  Any idea what I can do?  Or
where I can look?

Thank You,
-Mike

Sorry, this is probably obvious, but I use a high resolution monitor 
and end up with a very small black cursor that is hard do find. It 
here a way to make the cursor obvious. Change size, blink, change 
color etc.

Thanks

Hello

I almost end my configuration and it looks great.
But there are some things I can't set.

1. Is it possible to turn off icons (left edge of desktop) of iconified 
windows.
   I use taskbar and i dont need them.

2. Clicking on the clock in the FvwmTaskBar should run command (ex. 
calendar).

3. I use function:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
+ I ThisWindow (Iconic) Iconify off
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) ThisWindow (Raised) Iconify on
+ I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Focus
+ I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Raise

It works fine but doesn't iconify Maximized windows. How to fix that ?

4. Is it possible to dynamicaly generate Menus content using conditions 
without using external functions ?

DestroyMenu FvwmTaskBarMenu
AddToMenu FvwmTaskBarMenu
+ "Iconify"                  FvwmIconify (if window is not iconified)
+ "DeIconify"                FvwmIconify (if window is iconified)


Thanks for any help.
Bambero

Try replacing the second line with:

+ I TestRc (NoMatch) ThisWindow (Raised|Maximized) Iconify on

How do you mean?  Using PipeRead gives good flexibility.

The fvwm2 man page includes the following information:

,----[ session_management.txt ]-

|   Fvwm doesn't save any information regarding styles, decors,
|   functions or menus.  If you change any on these resources during
|   a session (e.g. by issuing Style commands or by using various
|   modules), these changes are lost after saving and restarting the
|   session. *** To become permanent, such changes have to be added to
|   the configuration file.***

`----

It would help at least one novice to have an example of an entry in
the (personal) configuration file that shows how to make a routinely
used menu into a permanent entry whenever fvwm2 is started.

For the record, I use one menu per page and switch between pages to
access my various (routinely-used) menus.

If this information is already documented, I would be grateful to be
pointed to the reference.

If I understand you, you just want to add something like:

DestroyMenu mymenu
AddToMenu mymenu
+ "program1" Exec exec prog1
+ "program2" Exec exec prog2 -option
 
Although I doubt that is what you want -- can you provide a clearer
example of what you're actually wanting to do?

You seem to be running a current enough version.

Strip down your config file so that is is sufficient to demonstrate
the problem and then mail it to me directly.

Hi,

I have my desktop configured with taskbar+pager+gkrellm all in a 103 pixel
width column at the left of the screen, so when I maximize a window, most of
the times I want this vertical bar to remain visible; for this I wrote the
next little function:

DestroyFunc Maxitotal
AddToFunc Maxitotal
+ I     Maximize 92 100
+ I     Move 103p 0p

It works fine when maximizing a window, the problem comes when unmaximizing
it, it returns the window to its original size, but not to its original 
position, so it's a bit odd...

I wonder how should I do it, is there any variable where is stored the
original position of the window? maybe should I use any kind of conditional
sentence so the "move" command is just executed when the window is not
maximized?

Thanks for your help:

Nacho

The whole thing you want to do can be done with EWMHBaseStruts - With=20
the improvement that you don't have to implement the stuff by yourself=20
since Fvwm does that for you with the Function Maximize.

Right -- you want to see 'SessionInitFunction' as that function is the
same as the above *except* that it runs only via a session manager.

Yup.  I hate doing this, but you might also want to read an article I
published on session management and fvwm:

No. The only usage of SessionInitFunction I know is to start FvwmBanner.
I don't think X applications (even xearth) belong to SessionInitFunction.
Otherwise a user gets 2 copies of the same applications on the next
start, one copy is started by a session manager. However different X
programs behave differently regarding SM, so if SM does not start one,
then and only then it may be placed in SessionInitFunction.

Mikhael.

Hi all, I am wondering whether the following is a bug

I have a .fvwm2rc file with the following two lines

Style * ClickToFocusRaises
Style xterm GrabFocus

To reproduce the bug:

1. open any program and have mouse focus on it (perferably a browser,
something taking up a lot of screen size)
2. start xterm
3. xterm grabs focus, if the mouse happen to be over the xterm window,
repeat from step 1 until mouse is not over the xterm window and is over
the program opened in step 1
4 notice how xterm has focus and the mouse is not over it
5 now click on the program opened in step one. notice that the window is
RAISED but *NOT* focused.

if the policy states clicktofocusraise shouldnt the it raises and
focuses the window? this is very annoying.

the workaround is to move mouse over to xterm then move it back over to
the other program

version is fvwm 2.5.12 compiled on Mar 18 2005 at 00:50:43
with support for: ReadLine, RPlay, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM,
Bidi text, Xinerama, XRender, XFT, NLS

Greetings, All.

I'd like to ask the advice of this list's readers. I'm writing a module in 
Perl. More to the point, I'm writing a HowTo about writing modules in Perl,
and I'd like my doc to reflect something approaching best practice. 

The thing is that the code is approaching that level of complexity when I
would usually split a perl script into modules. Just to be clear, that's
perl modules as in files ending in '.pm. and included using the "use"
pragma, as opposed to scripts executed by FVWM that just happen to be
written in Perl.

So the question is, where would be the best place to keep these? If they were
part of the distribution, they could find a home in the directory pointed at by 'fvwm-perllib dir'. But they're not.

I don't mind explaining about PERL5LIB and how to set up local lib directory, 
I was just wondering what would satisfy the principle of least surprise for
long time FVWM users.

I'm tending towards saying "create a directory $FVWM_USERDIR/perl and put the .pm files in there" and then pointing the script at the modules with a "use lib" directive. The trouble is that's fragile. If I hardcode the location and they can't use it, or don't want to use it, then the module breaks.

So I'm back to explaining about PERL5LIB which seems a bit of an overhead for a module that should just load and go. I suppose I could jam all the packages into one file. Bad perl practice there, but it'd solve the problem.

So: any thoughts or ideas? Anyone solved this already? Is there an orthodox FVWM way to approach this problem?

Thanks for your time,

Nick Fortune

This is the way to go. Personally I would use $FVWM_USERDIR/perllib name
to match FVWM_DATADIR/perllib, since it is for classes, not for scripts.

If you want to handle the situation, you may do it in your module.

BEGIN {
	my $user_perllib_dir = "$ENV{FVWM_USERDIR}/perllib";
	die "Please create $user_perllib_dir with .pm files from http://url\n"
		unless -d $user_perllib_dir;

	use lib $user_perllib_dir;
	use MyModule1;
	use MyModule2;
}

This will show all possible errors on STDERR. If you also want to
show them in some X message box, you may use this solution instead:

BEGIN {
	my $user_perllib_dir = "$ENV{FVWM_USERDIR}/perllib";
	use FVWM::Module::Toolkit;

	FVWM::Module::Toolkit->showError("Please create ...", "My Error")
		unless -d $user_perllib_dir;

	use lib $user_perllib_dir;
	use FVWM::Module::Toolkit qw(MyModule1 MyModule2);
}

If there will be ever a practical problem (and not just theoretical,
there are no many perl module writters) I will add the built-in support,
and it will be just "use FVWM::Module::Toolkit qw(~ MyModule1 MyModule2)".

P.S. About the terminology, please use "perl classes", not "perl modules"
to avoid the confusion with "fvwm modules".

Mikhael.

hi guys:
	I use Alt+tab in FVWM to switch between windows. the problem that
bothers me is that there is too little information showing in the
windowlist, for example, all xterm windows just show "xterm". so I do
not know which xterm window is the one I want to go to. it would be
more informative if the list also shows, for example, the working
directory, recent commands in that window, etc. 

	anybody knows how to do this? ( I do not want to use the "instant
snapshot" approach, cuz I'm too lazy to do the config, and it's
probably too slow for my machine .... )


	thanks a lot!

	Yang

This solution is application-specific, but what i do is include the 
working directory in the xterm titlebar. And then do this separately for 
other applications in which i want more information, for instance.

.bashrc:

case $TERM in
     xterm*)
         TITLEBAR='\[\033]0;xterm:\w\007\]'
         ;;
     *)
         TITLEBAR=''
         ;;
esac
PS1="${TITLEBAR}\u@\h:\w\$ "

this sets the prompt to be user@host:directory
and the title to be xterm:directory

It is included in the PS1 variable, that way every time the prompt is 
printed the title bar is updated.

 My apologies for failing to mention one important item - I access fvwm2
 via fvwm-themes. 
 
 Here is the content of my "personal" directory:
 
  [felixk@carrot felixk]$ ls -l .fvwm/themes/personal/
 total 64
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk   96 Apr 18  2003 bindings-extra
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk 8008 Feb 28 11:52 functions-appbind

 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk  678 Mar 16 12:32 menus-extra
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk    0 Apr 18  2003 menus-programs-extra
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk   80 Aug 14  2004 startup
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk   95 Apr 18  2003 startup.01.bk
 -rw-r--r--  1 felixk felixk   68 Apr 18  2003 stroke-extra
 
 And these are the current entries in my "startup" file (which I imagine
 needs additions):
 
 AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Exec sleep 5 
 + I Exec exec xearth -label -wait 240         
 
 The programs that I load routinely are the Opera browser, the Pan
 newsreader and the Gnome terminal.  I load each of them onto a different
 page and envisage that the pages need to be specified in the start-up
 file. It would be great if the programs opened at the point at which
 they were closed when fvwm2 was shutdown.  Not really necessary since
 Opera and Pan do this by default.
 
 I hope that I have the terminology correct.
 
 Thank you for the prompt reply.

Hi,

I have written a small FvwmScript consisting of a single ItemDraw
whose text should be changed while changing pages. The text should
be sent externally via a SendToModule call. I have two questions
about it:

1. I use the command 'WindowTitle {FvwmPageName}' in the FvwmScript
   and the window is identified as such with FvwmIdent. However,
   issuing an
     SendToModule FvwmPageName SendString 1 1 aaa
   doesn't work. Experimenting around I found out that
     SendToModule *fvwmPageName SendString 1 1 aaa
   works. Is that expected behaviour?

2. I bound the SendToModule call to a FvwmEvent (new_page). This
   works ok, but when I change the page in the pager dragging the
   right mouse button (for having parts of several pages on screen),
   the FvwmEvent is triggered constantly, so the "scroll effect" is
   not smooth as it used to be. Is there a workaround for it? I can
   not use '*FvwmEvent: Delay' because when I change pages with the
   keyboard I DO want the FvwmEvent to be triggered, even if the
   changes are nearly simultanous. I think FvwmPager should
   produce only a new_page event when the page with maximum area on
   screen changes.

BTW: In the FvwmScript man page in 2.5.12, in the 'PERIODIC TASKS'
section it is stated that the block shouls start with a 'Periodic
Task' keyword. This should be changed to 'PeriodicTasks', shouldn't
it? Perhaps it is already so in the last development version.	

Greetings,

David

Hi!

I would like to have the skype icon in a systray within FVWM2.

For this purpose I have installed fbpanel, which works standalone nicely.

But after swallowed, it doesn't accept the skype icon anymore.

In fvwm.rc I swallow fbpanel:
*FvwmButtons(Swallow "fbpanel" "Exec /usr/bin/fbpanel")

philipp@chief:~$ cat .fbpanel/default
Global {
edge = bottom
allign = left
margin = 3
widthtype = pixel
width = 64
heighttype = pixel
height = 32
roundcorners = false
Transparent = true
TintColor = 0xFF00FFFF
Alpha = 255
}

Plugin {
type = tray
} 

Now I have the fbpanel in my Buttons and it looks nicely. But after I start
skype and the icon gets into fbpanel the button is only gray. Only after I
resize the buttonbar the icons show up. It is not only with skype but with
every software that puts an icon in there or removes one. Only after a redraw
it works again.

Maybe someone could help me with this issue.
thanks
Philipp

I've just installed 2.5.12 on an x86-64 Ubuntu system.  The
window manager works, more or less, but the FvwmPager module
doesn't do anything at all.

Is there something I can do to diagnose why it is that the
pager is doing nothing?  I've been using FVWM2 for years, but
I've never had such a problem.  The configuration I'm currently
using is inherited from a previous system (and works just fine
there and in several other machines).

Does this happen with fvwm-2.5.12 deb linked from the FVWM home page?

If yes, you probably have some ModulePath line that you should remove.

Yes, in fact that was it!  Thanks very much; I just figured this out
about 5 minutes ago.

Belatedly, I have finally located a  fvwm man page that appears to
address my problems.  It says:

,----

|  Most users just should put:
| 
|             fvwm-themes-start
| 
|        as  the  last  line of their .Xclients, .xinitrc or .xsession file.  If
|        you want to use FVWM Themes with a real session manager, say GNOME, you
|        need to use the --no-start option and put:
| 
|             fvwm-themes-start --no-start
|             gnome-session
`----

And then?

It looks as though both entries are taken seriously.  I end up with
the gnome desktop and my previous-loaded packages - when loaded onto
the desktop - open at the point at which I had left them when I shut down
fvwm2.

The first tweak suggested in:

 http://linuxgazette.net/100/adam.html

does not appear to work in conjunction with "fvwm-themes".  I have
failed to locate the "gnome-session-manager" (because I lack a basic
familiarity with Gnome) and I suspect that the "killall" command needs
additional modification if it is to start "fvwm-themes" next time.

And, in view of the other posts, where should the xearth command go?
Left where it is or into ".xinitrc"?

I venture to send this follow-up, because it looks as though it now needs
very little to achieve what I was trying to do.

And then... what?  that's it.  Fvwm is running within the session
manager - you can do as you were.  :)

The "killall" command is used so that the current running window manager
is kicked out from under the session manager, replacing it with fvwm.
With fvwm-themes, this is just fvwm, so --replace will still work,
providing you call not fvwm-themes, but:

fvwm -f themes-rc

(IIRC -- it has been a while since I last looked at fvwm-themes.)  As
for gnome-session-manager -- it's just called 'gnome-session'.

It should be OK where it is.

I have this in my .bashrc:

	# this makes the title of the terminal window 'user@host:  
/present/working/directory/'
	# see the Eterm technical docs, "Set X Terminal Parameters"
	# 'ESC ] 0 ; string BEL' sets icon name and title to string
	if [[ "$TERM" != "linux" ]] ; then
     		PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD}\007"'
	fi

Though it does the same thing, it doesn't use $PS1.  Theoretically, any  
command could generate the string, so you may be able to find a way to  
make it print out the command that you last executed.  I found this in the  
Eterm documentation, much of which applies to other terms:  
<http://www.eterm.org/docs/view.php?doc=ref>.

BTW, I did the whole snapshot window list thing.  You could probably just  
dump my config into a file, tweak it a bit, and do a Read on it.  I posted  
it on the FVWM forum here: <http://fvwm.lair.be/viewtopic.php?t=349>.

Hello,
since today I can use the pivot function (turning my monitor 90 degrees
to the right) with x.org and the brand new nvidia driver. However, if I
turn my monitor fvwm doesn't catch the new dimensions and so the
maximize stuff isn't working correct. So I wonder if someone knows how
to fix it?

When I restart fvwm it works perfectly. Of course I can easily script it
up, but maybe it is a good thing to get it fixes.

Sincerely,
	Thomas

Indeed. Look at my windowlist:

	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/fvwm/windowlist-20050514.png

The zoob lines are terminals, on the host zoob, in my home directory
(the "~"), running the command listed (or last ran the command
if <in-angle-brackets>).  The "E" is a vi edit window, editing
~/scripts/addif. And so forth.

I have a script ttylabel:

	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/css/bin/ttylabel

to write the icon and title strings. I make them the same although
obviously they could be different (I don't use icons...)

In a zsh I invoke this from the preexec() and precmd() functions.
In a bash I set $PROMPT_COMMAND=atprompt, where atprompt is a shell function
that runs ttylabel amongst other stuff.

So tweak your shell environment. It will serve you well regardless of what
window manager you use.

Cheers,

Sounds like you're using bash. It shares history across all shells.
However, the command "history 1", when used by the function called from
$PROMPT_COMMAND, should contain the last command executed for _that_
shell. Which would suffice:

	atprompt()
	{
	  ttylabel "$HOST $PWD <`history 1`>"
	}

Dear fvwm gurus and users,

could you give me tip, hint, link, info or whatsoever, where to find 
info how to localize fvwm and support languages (keyboard layouts, 
encoding, fonts) of far east - korean, japan.
Yes, sure, the first thing I did was RTFM and then contacting google, 
but no answer relevant to this topic. There are some old references 
dated back in 1999 or 2000.
Maybe some of you could help me.

Thank you for any help
( Even answer "read carefully the man pages once again, man" will help 
me and gives me hope the answer is there. )

If I'm not mistaken, you just should make localization of
you use and install apropriate fonts. As for me, I use Russian
KOI8-R localization. All I have done to use it with fvwm
I installed cyrillic fonts and inserted them in /etc/fonts/local.conf
and in /etc/X11/xorg.conf on my Gentoo box.

Cheers,   Alex

In den fruehen Abendstunden des 13. Februar 1945 gegen 21:41 Uhr
heulten die Sirenen der Lazarettstadt Dresden das erste mal auf. Die Bewohner der Elbmetropole machten sich zu der Zeit noch keine Sorgen, da Dresden als Stadt ohne Bewaffnung und ohne militaerischen Nutzen bekannt war und von ca. 1,2 Millionen Frauen, Kindern und Greisen bewohnt wurde.

Gegen 22:09 Uhr gab der Rundfunk durch, daß die alliierten Bomberverbaende ihren Kurs geaendert haben und nun auf Dresden zufliegen. Kurz darauf befanden sich 244 britische Bomber am Himmel der deutschen Kulturstadt. Drei Stunden nach dieser ersten Angriffswelle - es befanden sich bereits alle verfuegbaren Rettungsmannschaften, Sanitaeter und Feuerwehmaenner in Dresden - verdunkelten weitere 500 Bomber den Himmel.
Am naechsten Tag folgte die letzte Angriffswelle mit erneut 300 US-B-17-Bombern. Zwischen 12:12 Uhr und 12:21 Uhr warfen diese 783 Tonnen Bomben ab. - Das entspricht mehr als 85 Tonnen pro Minute. Nach dem Abwerfen setzten die US-Bomber zum Tiefflug an und beschossen Fluechtende mit ihren Bordwaffen. In diesen drei Angriffsschlaegen, die insgesamt 14 Stunden andauerten, warfen die "Befreier" 650.000 Brandbomben und 200.000 Sprengbomben ab, welche einen Feuersturm von ueber 1000 Grad in der Stadt erzeugten. Obwohl Dresden weder Flugabwehr, noch Ruestungsindustrie oder aehnliche kriegswichtige Ziele besass wurden weit mehr als 350.000 unschuldige deutsche Zivilisten in diesen zwei Tagen kaltbluetig ermordet.

Keiner der schuldigen Alliierten wurde jemals fuer dieses brutale Kriegsverbrechen auch nur angeklagt und die Massenmedien und die bundesdeutsche Regierung schweigen diese Taten tot und sehen es nicht als noetig an den Opfern zu gedenken.!

Hi, Alex,

thanks for your reaction.
I already tried to use suggested approach - installing fonts, but the 
result was not what I expect.
Then, I added korean keyboard layout as one can find in fedora core3 
distribution and tried to set keyboard map with xmodmap. But korean 
user, I am in contact with, claimed that "is not exactly what he needs".
As for me, I know nothing about korean language.
Based on information I finally have found, usage of korean keyboard 
layout is little bit more difficult than most of european languages due 
to its hangul and hanja. (who may be interested
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11202 )
I am keep on searching.
Any help from the fvwm community is welcome.

Finally!

I have always worried about the size of my penis.  When I have sex,
even though she says that the sex is good, I know that what she really
wants is an extra inch!

3 months ago I found The Extender.  I just put it on whilst I'm driving
the car and when I'm sleeping.  It stays hidden under my clothes and it 
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft.

I could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier, but I
thought that when I took it back off I would shrink back to original
size.  I was really surprised!

I have been 4.5" long since adolescence
When I took off The Extender I was measuring 6.5"
After not wearing the extender for a week, I am still 6" long!

The lengthening is permanent!

I could not believe the results of this device.  I am back to wearing it
again and I'm still getting larger!  My girlfriend says it is the best
product I've ever bought, and she ALWAYS reminds me to put it on if I
forget!

Take a peek... We know it works.  There's a total guarantee with it, too.  If
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back.  Every penny.  No-one sends them back!

The Extender correct the curve of the penis too, straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow!

Two part question:
Is it possible to send a command from outside the config file (from a 
terminal or perl script) telling fvwm to perform a function?
And if so how could I go about adding a function to run the Thumbnail 
function I have on all Windows except 1 (specified as Mezzo-bin)?

I'd have to see the specific function to help you there.  But the
negation of it would be something like:

ThisWindow ("some_name")  Nop

I have a Colorset that is used for my menus.
It appears that AspectPixmap does not work correctly for menus.
I have:

	MenuStyle "*" MenuColorset 2

and I say, via FvwmCommand, some Colorset commands to set the menu backdrop.
When I say:

	Colorset 2 AspectPixmap /path/to/image.png

I get an image that appears somewhat adjusted for the menu, but incorrectly.
The image width appears to have been stretched to fit the menu, but the
height is grossly wrong (generally it seems too short), and so the Aspect
of the image is not the original aspect.

Further, if I pop up a tall menu I get an image apparently sized for the
width of the menu (but with the aspect ratio shorter than the original
image), with the root background in the unfilled areas.

Then a subsequent short menu gets the image apparently again sized for
the width  of the menu (and again with the aspect ratio to short - more
so than before) and with left over pixels from the previous, larger,
image resize for the previous tall menu.

It appears to me that the image resizing is being called with the correct
menu width (and presumably then the correct menu height), but the new
image size computation based on this to preserve the image backdrop is
not quite right. And the buffer used for the backdrop is not initialised
correctly, but reused from an earlier buffer (or maybe just memory that
happens to overlap that).

[ Pulls out 2.5.12 source... ]
Should I be concerned by menustyle_free_face() in menustyle.c that says:

        switch (mf->type)
        {
        case GradientMenu:
                [...]
                break;
        case PixmapMenu: 
        case TiledPixmapMenu:
                if (mf->u.p)  
                {       
                        PDestroyFvwmPicture(dpy, mf->u.p);
                }
                mf->u.p = NULL;
                break;
        case SolidMenu:
                FreeColors(&mf->u.back, 1, True);
        default:
                break;
        }
        mf->type = SimpleMenu;

No AspectPixmap there. Is that a problem?

Pixmap and TiledPixmap seem to behave, but they are not what I want.

AspectPixmap would be I hope.

I basicly want a full view of the image, shrunk/enlarged to fill the menu
in one direction and padded by the default background in the other to fit
(or maybe left aligned, or tiled in that size). Since menus are dynamic
in size (i.e. WindowList menus mostly) neither Pixmap nor TiledPixmap
quite cut it because my desired backgrounds are pictures and not tiles.

Cheers,

Hi list 

this is my key binding 
Key Left        A       SM      CursorMove -30 +0
which means Ctrl+Alt+Left the cursor will move 1/3 left of the screen 

I find this is very useful for us to move the cursor of the mouse 

Now my question is whether there is a key binding to achieve this kind of
action: right/left/middle  click of the mouse

Thank you for you attetion!

There's the 'FakeClick' command, but don't expect it to work all the
time.

A mouse Action looks like:

(copied from http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/Thomas_Adam-desk-1280x960/config)

// start quote

# Handle some Mouse bindings now...
# Recall that mouse formats look like this:
#
# +------------+
# | ||  ||  || |
# |	           |
# +------------+
#   1   3   2
# Binding Functions
#
# "I" stands for Immediate
# "M" stands for Motion
# "C" stands for Click
# "H" stands for Hold
# "D" stands for Double Click

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Contexts:
#     R = Root Window                 rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
#     W = Application Window          rIrrrrFSSSSSSSSSFrrrrr
#     F = Frame Corners               rrrrrrS13TTTT642Srrrrr
#     S = Frame Sides                 rIrrrrSwwwwwwwwwSrrrrr
#     T = Title Bar                   rrrrrrSwwwwwwwwwSrrrrr
#     I = Icon                        rIrrrrFSSSSSSSSSFrrrrr
#                                     rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
# Numbers are buttons: 1 3 5 7 9   0 8 6 4 2
#
# Modifiers: (A)ny, (C)ontrol, (S)hift, (M)eta, (N)othing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# click in the root menu
Mouse 1    R       A	Menu FvwmMenuRoot
Mouse 2	   R       A	WindowList
Mouse 3    RFT     A	Menu FvwmMenuWindowOps

// end quote

So - if you add the following lines
Mouse 1        A       SM      CursorMove -30 +0
Mouse 2        A       SM      CursorMove -30 +0
Mouse 3        A       SM      CursorMove -30 +0

That should do ... at least when your mouse is not over an open window,
which fetches its actions ...

greetings,

Arno Venner

Maybe you already know it... if you press Shift+NumLock you can make clicks 
with the "5" of the numeric pad, this is a X feature I think, but if you don't
need it to use it in a Fvwm function maybe it serves your purpose.

Nacho

I really need to fix my diagrams:

1 2 3 

is the correct order for mouse-clicks.

This isn't a problem specific to fvwm, I saw it in twm also, but it is
driving me nuts.

I just switched to an amd64 system. I'm using xinerama to have 2 1600x1200
displays side by side. When I ssh into a remote host ahd have x11 forwarding
turned on, whenever I try to open any application that would open a window,
it doesn't open properly or render to the displays. If the application would
have a border, I just get the border and inside I just see the background
of the display, and it gets dragged around as I drag the border around.

If I don't have a window manager running (fvwm2) there's no problem. I've
tried twm also. I tried building fvwm2 with no xinerama support and that
didn't improve anything.

I'm running:
FVWM version 2.4.16 compiled on May 12 2005 at 09:37:12
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, Shape, SM, Xinerama

I've tried much more recent fvwm2 and all versions have the same problem.

Details:

AMD64 system
X.org server X Window System Version 6.8.2
fvwm 2.4.16 and all others
nv and nvidia drivers both tried, no difference
Video cards are 2 geforce2 mx400 pci cards
Problem only arises with X11 forwarding over ssh
Problem goes away if I don't run a window manager
Problem occurs with twm also


In order to clean up the frame that's left sitting there I need to execute
some command on the remote host to kill the application. The frame stays
around. Then I pop up the "Destroy" icon Window Ops item and click on the
frame, then it goes away.

If anyone has any clue as to where the problem might reside, please let me
know. CC dash@xdr.com on all replies please.

Thanks!!!
-Dave

I think this is customizable, in the same way that the resolution of a real
mouse... I would just have a look at the X documentation, try google and it
should find it quickly.

The proof of concept model has extracted gold and silver from various samples of carbonaceous ore bodies. 

With only a few equipment enhancements future Oretech production units should be able to extract many additional metallic elements including platinum, rhodium and scandium. OreTech, Inc's business model is to become a major producer of gold and other precious metals through the use of its proprietary technology. OreTech is commercializing a new, standard setting ore and minerals processing and environmental remediation technology, utilizing a proprietary high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic metals from various ore tailings, dump piles, head ore and other industrial feedstock such as electronic waste. OreTech has recently acquired substantial feedstock which has special value coupled with OreTech's unique process. Overall, management has been encouraged by the initial results and reiterates its technology will favorably address certain issues associated with the mining industry:


No need for hazardous cyanide heap leaching. 
Minimal power requirements. 
Acceptable recovery rates from dump and tailings feedstock. 
This technology represents a major innovation in the industry. 
With this in mind, the Company's objectives over the next year include: 

Continued validation of the Company's technology on several different sources of feedstock.
Further study on optimal scalability.
Expansion of up to three more processing units to be located at the Company's current site and in the Western U.S. 

Management maintains, meeting these objectives could allow the Company to achieve processing rates of up to 1000-1250 tons of raw feedstock per week within the next twelve months.

Unfortunately "the X documentation" is pretty large.
Try "man xset"; it has controls for the mouse acceleration.

Subject: FVWM: transperant taskbar  
X-Mailer: VM 7.18 under 21.4 (patch 14) "Reasonable Discussion" XEmacs Lucid
X-Spam-Score: -4.9 (----)
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi all,
I try to make my fvwm taskbar to appear transparent, using

Colorset 8 Transparent buffer,fg red,  fgsh #000000, bg average,\
           sh black, hi black, Tint #283e5e 65
Colorset 9 Transparent buffer,fg blue,  fgsh #000000, bg average,\
           sh black, hi black, Tint #283e5e 65
*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset 8
*FvwmTaskBar: IconColorset 8
*FvwmTaskBar: FocusColorset 9

However, I only have partial success. The taskbar is transparent, but
when I switch between different pages the titles of the `tasks' piling
up. For example, I switch between page 1 where a xemacs is running and
page 2 where a xterm is running, then xterm is written over xemacs in
the taskbar.
Did anyone come across that feature before?

I'm using 2.5.12 on solaris 8

Thanx in advance
ingo

You should really add to that:

ColorSet 8 ...... RootTransparent, Transparent ....

for both colorsets.

Having recently moved from Alpha to SuSE Linux (using fvwm as window 
manager, but kdm to start X as default with SuSE [9.2]) I've noticed a 
funny behaviour in some applications :

(1) RSI IDL plot windows seems not to have any backing store. When they
    are obscured I lose the obscured part, when I move them to another
    dekstop page I lose all.

    (on Alpha they used to behave like that only after several days the
    server was running, like it had exhausted backing store memory)

    NB xwininfo returns
    Backing Store State:  Always
    Save Under State: no

(2) a small application of mine (Fortran wrapped around C Xlib calls)
    has a similar behaviour (on Alpha it did work). Windows are created
    with

     flag=CWBitGravity|CWWinGravity|CWBackingStore;
     XChangeWindowAttributes(dpy,win,flag,&attrib);

(3) the Hessling editor (the) in Xcurses mode sometimes presents a
    problem (when I do a large mouse cut-an-paste it hangs, and then if I
    obscure part of the edit window it remains white and deprived of
    textual content).

    This behaviour occurred also (more frequently) on Alpha and is
    possibly unrelated with the other two (looks more an overflow of
    the clipboard)

    Anyhow xthe windows return to xwininfo

    Backing Store State: NotUseful
    Save Under State: no

    which is also what xterm or rxvt do (and they work)

Now I wonder whether this has anything to do with fvwm or with the X 
server. I tried adding this to my .fvwmrc, but with no effect

Style * BackingStore
Style * SaveUnder

I have no idea of how to check whether backing store is enabled in the X 
server. It looks like the server runs as 

/usr/X11R6/bin/X -nolisten tcp -br vt7 -auth blabla

but some of those options are undocumented in the X man page (and it does 
not mention backing store).

Any clue ?

Check this way:

  xdpyinfo | grep back      
  options:    backing-store NO, save-unders NO

The last time I tried running with it on,
everything seemed to slow down.

To turn it on, it your Xorg.conf file add to the Device
section:

    Option "BackingStore" "True"
    Option "SaveUnders" "True"

It should be documented in 'man xorg.conf' but I don't see it there.

FVWM Ver: 2.5.12 on Linux

I have created a small set of pixmaps for my title bar buttons.  How do
I change the title bar buttons once activated?  I wish to change the
pixmap for the maximize button once the button is pressed so that it
looks different when a window is maximized and then change it back again
when the window is un-maximized.

Thanks in advance!

You may see how this is done in fvwm-themes[.sf.net]. Browse the file
named "buttons" in different themes. There are examples for vector-based
and image-based buttons, buttons that change the look on press and on
different window state.

Once you get the command names needed, look them up in fvwm man page.

Mikhael.

I've used IDL on Solaris and Linux, and I always had to tell it to use
it's own backing store by putting "device,retain=2" into its
startup-file.  The documentation says the default is to request the
server to do it, but that doesn't work.  BTW, you have to set it
before you open any IDL-windows.

Don't know if it has anything to do with FVWM, I don't use other
window managers :-)

I asked about missing backing store for some application windows under 
FVWM under Linux SuSE. It looks like it is not a FVWM issue but an Xserver 
issue.

First of all Dan Espen suggested a way to check whether the server has it
 
>   xdpyinfo | grep back
>   options:    backing-store NO, save-unders NO
 
Then Rainer Koehler commented about one specific application (RSI IDL)
 
> I've used IDL on Solaris and Linux, and I always had to tell it to use
> it's own backing store by putting "device,retain=2" into its
> startup-file.  

I discovered the RETAIN option of IDL myself looking in the manual (but my 
experience on Digital Unix and Solaris was that the system WAS providing 
backing store so I never needed it before).

That would fix this single application nicely. It won't fix a less modern 
application of mine which relies on the server.

The clue came again from Dan Espen :

> To turn it on, it your Xorg.conf file add to the Device section:
>
>     Option "BackingStore" "True"
>     Option "SaveUnders" "True"

I read again the xorg.conf, X and also Xorg and Xservers man pages, and 
they are not so explicit or clear about this option, but apparently 
putting the first of the two options in /etc/X11/xorg,conf (if SuSE won't 
overwrite it next time) does the trick for all applications. I tried also 
with both options, and it works too, but the second one is apparently 
unnecessary (the xorg log file says "not used").

I'll try to leave it turned on and see whether I notice performance 
degradation (so far not).
