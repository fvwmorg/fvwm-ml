Dear ALl,

Simple question; n the FvwmPager module, each desk has the title above it.
IE, Desk 0, Misc, whatever. How do I turn this off? I only use one desktop
of 3x3, and its annoying. :)

*FvwmPagerFont  none

This is actually mentioned in the man page for FvwmPager.

set the following property for the font:

*FvwmPagerFont none
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 0x0

that should do it :)

Hi all,

   A newbie question (please forgive me).

   I finally figured out (almost) how to get the FvwmButtons to work for
   me.  Just one question regarding a swallowed xload.  Is it possible
   to have the FvwmButtons and/or the xload to preserve the "load graph"
   while re-starting fvwm2?  What I mean is I would like the "history"
   so far be preserved when fvwm2 is restarted.

   I have:

   *MyFButtons(Swallow(UseOld, NoClose) XLoad \
      `Exec xload -fg green -bg black -hl red &`)

   but I guess the "NoClose" doesn't really do the job :)

   Is what I want to do possible at all?

   Thanks in advanced,


Patrick K ...

I was trying to do this too, as and far is I can tell NoClose and UseOld
simply don't work.  I think that if you start up xload from your .xsession
file instead of from fvwm that it won't die when you restart, but it's been a
while.  UseOld does't work for me either, so I just gave up.  I don't restart
fvwm all that often anymore.

I applied the second patch this morning, and recompiled and haven't
noticed any problems so far. (UltraSparc 1, Solaris 2.5) And it looks
cool.

  Generic> What is the difference between FVWM and Motif????

Motif is commercial.  It is a library of GUI elements that can be used
for C programs.  Motif also comes with some example programs, such as
mwm, the Motif window manager.  Often, people say Motif when they mean
mwm.

Fvwm is free software (as defined by the GNU public licence).  It is a
window manager.

A window manager is a program that draws borders around windows, that
lets you move windows from one place to another, that lets you choose
a window from a list of windows, and so on.  Because the window
manager functionality is embedded into popular OSes like Win95, people
coming from these systems have difficulty seeing the advantage of
having a special window manager program that does this.  The
advantage, of course, is that you can choose the program that you like
best, and often these programs are customizable to a degree much
beyond that of Win95.  For example, I have customized my Fvwm to look
(but not feel) like Win95, because I really liked that combination of
grey with dark blue, but I didn't like the keybindings and mouse
bindings at all.

Would it be appropriate for someone in the fvwm project to send me a clean
set of fvwm startup files?  Here's my rationale:

Is it just me, or did the automated (create config files to provide all
things for all people using all software) process, that came with the
RedHat package, lead too the creation of a web of confusion in the fvwm
startup files?  Where instead of having:
	exec a
	exec b
	exec c
We have in our cantancourous catacoumn of confusing fvwm startup files
something more like:
	if not m define n 
	if m and n exist define L		bare with me here, I know this is a poor
example
	if L > define p exec a		
	else if n exec b
	else if exec c
There's absolutely no need for future changes of elementary X Windows -
FVWM environment characteristics to involve hrs of analysis in order to
sort out the intent of this convoluted code.  Or is it just me... and I
need to buckle down and figure this stuff out?

Hi,

just a quick question: I just installed fvwm2.0.46 and noticed a slight
difference between my old wm (ncdwm) and fvwm2. In an xterm,
double-clicking to select text results in different selections under ncdwm
and fvwm. Specifically, it looks like ncdwm has more "leniency" in
selection text. It seems like (if this is how it's done), the regexp in
fvwm doesn't include things like periods ("."), etc. 

I guess the question is: is this a wm related problem, or something else
entirely. If it is fvwm related, I'm assuming the regexp would be simple
to change to my liking, and recompile, but, what part of the code is it
in?

Thanks,

	Looking through the archives, I've seen this question a couple 
of times, but never with a response, so I'll try it again (; :

	Is there a 'default' MiniIcon available so that, when
'ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon' or '*FvwmIconMan*drawicons true' is used, you
don't get the blank box when there isn't a real MiniIcon, but instead
get the original ButtonStyle appearance?  jline.xpm is close, but it
doesn't have the same behavior.

Hi, long time no mail...

Well, I've been without decent UN*X access for some 18 months, and
so have been prevented from using fvwm (or X in general, of course).

I now have access to an SGI Indigo running Irix 5.3, but without the
compiler options. Yes, that's right, SGI supply machines without the
gubbins to allow you to compile *anything* on them, even if you try
to install gcc (which won't install because of the missing components).

Does anybody have a pre-compiled set of binaries for this kind of
set-up?

Many thanks,
Ben.

I would suggest that this is better done with a shell script that you
could Exec from a menu or a button.  If you want any fvwm native
functions done as part of your particular order of ops, check out
FvwmCommand in the extras directory and use that in your script.

Hi

This is totally unrelated to the window manager. The X server administers
the selection clipboard, and individual apps and toolkits are responsible
for selection policy.

In xterm this policy is set as the Xresource charClass. Read the section
labelled "CHARACTER CLASSES" in the xterm man page.

Dear fans and users of fvwm,

I often remark following behaviour of fvwm2:
When clicking on the menu bar of an application, the pull-down menu
appears for a tenth of a second or so, and afterwards disappears 
directly. No, it does not disappear in reality - as one can see if
the application window is very small and the pull-down menu is very 
big (bigger than the window), the pull-down menu appears *behind* the
application's window!

This appears to happen with almost any application I use.
What can I do to prevent this?

I use fvwm-2.0.45.

Ciao, Thomas

Hi,  I noticed this also and did a little experimenting to come up with a
theory...

Do you run autoraise?  I do.  I believe what is happening in my case is
that I mouse to a new window and hit a button.  The pull-pull down menu
appears, then the auto-raise timer expires and raises the main window above
(infront) of the pull-down menu.  

How do I support this theory... if I click anywhere in the main window that
cancels the button then hit the button again the pull-down appears and
stays there.  

My solution : with my autoraise set to .5 seconds I usually wait out the
timer whenever I switch windows before hitting a button.

Do you notice the same pattern as I do (menu never disappears if main
window has focus for longer than autoraise timer)?

If you invoke Fvwm with fvwm95, type "man fvwm95" to access the

You're correct.

This definitely occurs as a result of using FvwmAuto with a reasonably
large timeout. I've been experimenting with this as a result of the
same problem occuring with the Pager balloons. The only solution so far
is to keep the FvwmAuto timeout small (order of 100 msec), or wait a bit
longer before pulling down a menu immediately after entering the window.

There is another class of window-popped_up-over-the-menu problem with some
Motif processes.  Whether by Motif programming error or some poor design
interaction (it works successfully for the mwm, but not fvwm), menus
invoked by clicking on the body of windows (not pulldown menu bars!) pops
up the requested menu, but this is immediately followed by a window raise
event.  I thought I might be able to do an explicit raise on the window
and then pop up the menu successfully, but this is not the case.  After
the menu arrives, the parent window is raised and covers it.  Placement
variations by invoking the menu near the sides of the main window allow
one to see the little popup poking its nose or foot from under the main
window.  I don't know why mwm knows to avoid this and fvwm doesn't.  In
all probability, there is an explicit window raise called from the
application by the mouse click.  If it were invoked before the menu, it
would be OK, but mwm doesn't obscure the menu.  This is similar to the
behavior mentioned in this thread.  Apparently fvwm is perfectly willing
to cover up a popup menu, while mwm somehow prevents it.  

What property is mwm respecting, and it one which fvwm can/should be made
to listen to?

Yes, Linux with fvwm is sufficient, no need to buy commercial
software.  Some commercial Unixen (Unices?) use the Display Postscript
extension (notably SunOS and Solaris) for some programs; on these, you
might not be able to run all programs remotely.  But Motif isn't
needed at all.  All Motif clients run fine when started on your Ultrix
with redirected display to your Linux machine.  You can even run mwm
this way, if you really want...

Greetings!  This is my de-lurking post.  Do with it
what you must... :-)

I think fvwm needs a better, more customizable method for
doing autoraising.  In particular, I'm thinking of a Style
entry

e.g.

Style "emacs" Icon emacs.xmp, Nohandles, Autoraise 300
...
Style "pager" Autolower 100

The point is that it would be nice to be able to control
the (auto) raising and lowering of windows on a window by
window basis.  I seem to remember using a WM which did this
(ctwm perhaps?) and it was very useful.

Any comments?  Is this a useful feature?
Anybody want to have a shot at implementing it?? :-)

				--ap

p.s. Let me say that fvwm is a joy to use, and it seems
     to be getting better every release.  I really like
     the color shading in title bars!  Very snazzy.

Subject: FVWM: StartsOnPage revisited
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


        There's been a fair amount of discussion recently about 
how to start an app on a particular page of the virtual desktop.
A StartsOnPage patch was posted here by Robert Joop back in April,
but it seems to have been largely ignored, possibly because it 
forced you to give up MiniIcons.

        I took a stab at a new StartsOnPage patch over the weekend.
It's working, but not quite complete. If you want to give it a try,
I've put up a page for my vast collection of FVWM patches (both of 
them) at 

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html

        Like the earlier effort, the StartsOnPage Patch implements a
new Style, StartsOnPage, but this one combines the functions of
StartsOnDesk and StartsOnPage. You can specify desktop only, page 
only, or both. It uses the existing STARTSONDESK_FLAG (StartsOnDesk
still works like always), so you don't have to give up any other
Styles to try it out. The Web page gives more detail, and the patch
includes a man page update.

        One caveat (this is the not-quite-complete part): it does
not address capturing/recapturing already existing windows, like at
startup or restart. Under certain conditions recaptured StartsOnPage
windows won't show up where you expect them. It is left as an 
exercise for the reader to figure out why.  ;-)   I'll try to add 
this part in the next few days, time permitting.


        Cheers,
        Bob

Hello,

please excuse me if this message really reaches you the second time now. 
My first subscription to the mailing list from yesterday was in error, and
unfortunately crossed with my first message. But finally, now I am really
subscribed. :-)

Ok, here's my message again:

I often remark following behaviour of fvwm2:
When clicking on the menu bar of an application, the pull-down menu
appears for a tenth of a second or so, and afterwards disappears 
directly. No, it does not disappear in reality - as one can see if
the application window is very small and the pull-down menu is very 
big (bigger than the window), the pull-down menu appears *behind* the
application's window!

This appears to happen with almost any application I use.
What can I do to prevent this?

I use fvwm-2.0.45.

Ciao, Thomas

My solution is as follows:
	As a menu is just a special window use editres to get the window name
        Use Style to make them StayOnTop

This is not exactly an "elegant" solution but it seems to work.

Hm, it definitely seems to deal with AutoRaise. But the behaviour does not
change even in I put a very short AutoRaise Time (even as short as 50 ms).

Unfortunately, this does not work either. It just seems to me that with
AutoRaise enabled, any first click on any application menu will raise it
immediately again. This also happens if I click somewhere else in the window
first, or on the title bar or on the "close" menu in the upper left of the
border.

Well, I've held out on using fvwm2 for some time now, being quite
content with the old 1.24, but the summer heat finally got to my head
and I decided to give it a shot.  After a couple of weeks of tinkering
and learning, I have a fairly useable .fvwm2rc file.  I do have,
however, a few problems which I have been unable to solve.  I've check
the archives and the man pages and haven't found anything yet, so I
was hoping some kind soul here might be willing to lend me a hand (or
at least some advice).

I'm using the fvwm2 from fvwm2-2.0.46-2.i386.rpm.

Problem #1: When swallowing xclock into an FvwmButton, the clock is
too small, and won't respond to my efforts at making it larger.  I'd
like it to fill up the button, but it stubbornly remains small.

Problem #2: After closing any window (using any method -- logging out
of an xterm, closing, deleting or destroying) my Key mappings won't
work until I use the mouse -- can't scroll with Ctrl-Arrow, can't
start up the root menu with Alt-F1, etc.  After I click on something
with the mouse, the Key mappings work again.

Problem #3: Menus don't respond to keys like they used to in 1.24.
ESC used to close a menu; not anymore.  Arrow keys used to move the
cursor down, up or across a menu; not anymore.  I have some menus with
underscored abbreviations (using the ampersand feature in the menu
lines), and these don't respond to key presses either.

I will gladly submit some or all of my .fvwm2rc file for inspection if
necessary.  I apologize if these are simple problems and I'm
overlooking something in the manpages, but, as I said, I have looked.

Any help will be appreciated.

I am using emacs and its mail reader vm for a while. I wanted the mail reader
window to be sticky so I added the line

Style   "RMAIL*"        MiniIcon mini-letter.xpm,Sticky

to my .fvwm2rc file. After restarting fvwm everything worked fine, when when
the RMAIL window is already open. But when I close it and open it once again
the properties the new window is not sticky. Only a restart of fvwm helps. So
can someone tell me what is going wrong?

I didn't see the problem when I  tried, perhaps you should try sending
the  part of your  config that shows the   problem.  I'm not a regular
fvwmButtons user, so send it to the list, not me.

This is a known problem.  So far, no one has tracked it down.
I tried, but so far, no success.

The arrow keys in menus should work, I use them  all the time.  Escape
works, except in cases where  you are using mwm menus,  and are over a
submenu item.   Hot keys should also work.   Perhaps something in your
.fvwm2rc is causing the problem,  however, I don't  see how.  Maybe if
you post your whole .fvwm2rc, someone will try it out...

Normally xclock puts a margin between the clock dial and the edge of
the window, so it's a little smaller than a window.  With really small clocks,
like those inside buttons, this makes the clock not use enough of the window
space.  From the xclock man page:

 -padding number
               This option specifies the width in pixels  of  the
               padding  between  the window border and clock text
               or picture.  The default is 10 on a digital  clock
               and 8 on an analog clock.

Try setting it to zero.

Hi out there!

Now i actually fell in love with the pinnable menus in WindowMaker but
don't really like this window manager enough to replace fvwm2 with it.
But then the "TO-DO list for fvwm 2.xx" suggests in the "New stuff:"
section "Pin up menus?".  

Is there hope for an implementation of pinnable menus as exist with
WindowMaker?  

IMHO pinnable menus are the most convenient thing i've ever worked
with in any window manager!  It's a pity though that WindowMaker is
not as customizable as fvwm2 and unfortunately can't be used without
this terribly superfluous docking station called Wharf.

Since WindowMaker is released under the GPL i suppose the relevant
code for the pinnable menus could easily be reused by some gifted
programmer for inclusion as a fvwm module.  Sorry, i'm no programmer
and therefore regrettably can't do it myself. :-(

                                      Thank you, P. *8^)

Hi

The promissed corrected windowshade patch is ready. The changes are
quite minimal. The moving-bar-swirls-shade-bug is corrected.

This is because Emacs is creating the new frame before you run rmail
in it, which is what puts the buffer name in the title.  Fvwm only
checks the window names for applying style when the window is first
created.  Unless you do a restart or recapture, fvwm won't see
changes.  So, you want to ensure that frame will be created with the
name you want to match your Style.  To do this, call make-frame with a
parameter list that includes the 'name symbol.

Does anyone know of a site where pre-compiled binaries for
fvwm2 can be found?  I've been using 1.24 for a couple
years now.  I've tried to compile fvwm2 with most new revs 
that have been released, with no luck.

I don't have root permission on my Sparc20.  The Solaris
install must be "non-standard".  I don't remember what
exactly the problems were; I think related to imake.
Anyway, I have gotten a couple other apps to compile
with my limited knowledge of make/imake/etc (vim5, xv3.1).

Our corporate IS guys won't put "beta software" on
the corporate software collection.

Anyway, will this even work (run-time libraries may not
be where fvwm2 expects them)?  If someone with this
compiled version could zip it & put it on the web, that
we be awesome.  Otherwise I'm stuck with 1.24 for a while.

You do not need root permissions to compile and install Fvwm on
Solaris.  The only thing you need to do is to modify Fvwm.tmpl to
point to the directories where you want to install stuff, eg
/home/kwerner/bin, /home/kwerner/man, /home/kwerner/lib and so on.

You might also need to edit Fvwm.tmpl to point to your libxpm if it
isn't installed in /usr/openwin/lib.  But that is no problem either:
just get libxpm, compile it, install it in ~/lib, point Fvwm.tmpl at
it.

I have successfully compiled and installed fvwm-2.0.45 under Solaris
2.5, in a non-standard directory
(/app/unido-i06/share/gui/fvwm/2.0.45), with a libxpm which was also
installed in a non-standard directory.  I didn't need root permissions
for anything except creating the directory where to install fvwm.

Good morning,

This would mean implementing AutoRaise inside fvwm core (boo! If I wanted
someone else to touch my windows I'd buy another mouse). Or - and this
sounds better - extending the "Style" flag to support modules'
configuration. Maybe something into that big style rewrite I hear
is planned.

There is a way of doing this with 2.0.46 already.  It involves using multiple 
FvwmAuto's and the Current command. Try the following

Module FvwmAuto 000 Raise000 Lower000
Module FvwmAuto 100 Raise000 Lower100
Module FvwmAuto 200 Raise000 Lower200
Module FvwmAuto 300 Raise000 Lower300
Module FvwmAuto 400 Raise000 Lower400
Module FvwmAuto 500 Raise000 Lower500

AddToFunc Raise000 # immediate raising windows
+ "I" Current [xv] Raise
+ "I" Current [FvwmButtons] Raise

AddToFunc Raise100 # fast raising windows
+ "I" Current [pager] Raise

AddToFunc Raise200

AddToFunc Raise300 # slower raising windows
+ "I" Current [emacs] Raise

AddToFunc Raise400

AddToFunc Raise500 # the rest 
+ "I" Current [!some-window-that-you-dont-want-autoraised] Raise

I know this involves 6 processes and 6 functions executed per focus change, but 
it keeps autoraise out of fvwm.  I think a longer term solution would be to 
rewrite FvwmAuto so as to be configurable on a per window basis e.g.

*FvwmAuto name=emacs, intime=300, infunc=Raise
*FvwmAuto name=pager, intime=100, infunc=Raise, outime=0, outfunc=Lower
*FvwmAuto name=*, intime=500, infunc=my_conditional_raise

Actually this is so different from FvwmAuto that it should have a new name.

Hope this helps,
Timbo.

Thanks to those who responded to my queries...

Problem #3 (no key response in menus) has been solved -- I was using
"Menu" when I should have been using "Popup".

Problem #2 (no key response after exiting a window), I have been told,
is a Known Infelicity: hopefully this will be ironed out eventually.

Problem #1 (restated below) has not yet been solved.  I tried invoking
xclock with -padding 0, tried setting up my FvwmButton with Padding 0 0
but neither (nor both together) worked.  I seem to remember a NoTitle
option for the Buttons, but I haven't tried that yet -- maybe that
will work (although, since I don't explicitly give the clock a title,
why would this make a difference?).

Here's what the line looks like in my .fvwmbuttonsrc file (called by
.fvwm2rc):

============
(Icon clock.xpm Padding 0 0 Swallow(Respawn) xclock `Exec xclock 
-bg khaki4 -padding 0` ) 
============

My only other comment, besides the fact that I think fvwm2 rocks, is
that I wish there was some way to tell a program to start on a certain
Page (not Desk) -- I've seen discussion of a StartsOnPage style, but
this is different than what I want -- I don't want a window _always_
to start on a certain page, just when I call it up in a certain
function -- so a modifier to Exec might do the trick.  I don't know.
Maybe there is a way to do this already, and I just haven't found it
yet: if so, any advice would be appreciated.

Again, thanks to those who have helped me thus far.

I still can't reproduce the problem, it looks  OK to me.  Of course, I
can't really tell what you are looking for.  I've included my complete
FvwmButtons config, and a "gif" file showing the resulting buttonbar.

I'm running this with the Solaris version of xclock:

*FvwmButtonsFore black
*FvwmButtonsBack gray
*FvwmButtonsFont -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*
*FvwmButtonsGeometry -1-1
*FvwmButtonsRows 1
*FvwmButtons Start map.xpm Popup StartMenu
*FvwmButtons (2x1 Container())
*FvwmButtons Resize  	 mini.resize.xpm   Resize
*FvwmButtons Move    	 mini.move.xpm     Move
*FvwmButtons Lower   	 mini.lower.xpm    Lower
*FvwmButtons Raise   	 mini.raise.xpm    Raise
*FvwmButtons Delete  	 mini.delete.xpm   Delete
*FvwmButtons Destroy 	 mini.destroy.xpm  Destroy
*FvwmButtons "Stick"     mini.stick.xpm    Stick
*FvwmButtons Restart     mini.excl.xpm     ButtonRestart
*FvwmButtons (End)
*FvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 1")
*FvwmButtons(2x1, Size 64 64, Swallow "XSysStats" 'Exec xsysstats \
 -hidelabels -sample 10 -bg gray -fg black -type disk -color blue \
 -type packets -color darkgreen -type cpu -color red')
*FvwmButtons(Icon clock.xpm Padding 0 0 Swallow(Respawn) xclock \
  `Exec xclock -bg khaki4 -padding 0` ) 
*FvwmButtons(1x1, Padding 8 8, Container(Frame 1))
*FvwmButtons(Swallow "asclock" 'Exec asclock -shape -led green -noblink')
*FvwmButtons(End)

Try this, to run an xterm on desk #2, page 1,1:

Desk 0 2
GotoPage 1 1
Exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -T "myterm"
wait "myterm"

At the risk of pushing an analogy too far, one _could_ get essentially the
desired behavior (put a given window on a given page of a given desk) by
the following mechanism (given the geometry held by the system, you
should be able to place a window to pixel resolution with respect to any
fiducial marker you choose; this is what differential GPS does):

Generate a "benchmark" window at geometry +0+0

>From wherever you are, knowing the page size, fvwm can pick up the
geometry of the window of this name, relative to the present page.  If
your display is 1280x1024 and you are 3 pages right and 1 down from the
starting page, you will pick up the geometry (a' la WindowList) as
-3840-1024. 

With this bit of info, you can anchor any new window at any point of any
page, and add to it the StartsOnDesk option with a SkipMapping option
added.

It "should not be too hard" to allow fvwm2 to make a phantom "window" at
startup and keep track of where this window is over time.  Then the "page"
one is on will be available trivially and one may make offsets with
respect to the current page.  Gotta go now, late for a meeting....

Hi out there!

Now i actually fell in love with the pinnable menus in WindowMaker but
don't really like this window manager enough to replace fvwm2 with it.
But then the "TO-DO list for fvwm 2.xx" suggests in the "New stuff:"
section "Pin up menus?".  

Is there hope for an implementation of pinnable menus as exist with
WindowMaker?  

IMHO pinnable menus are the most convenient thing i've ever worked
with in any window manager!  It's a pity though that WindowMaker is
not as customizable as fvwm2 and unfortunately can't be used without
this terribly superfluous docking station called Wharf.

Since WindowMaker is released under the GPL i suppose the relevant
code for the pinnable menus could easily be reused by some gifted
programmer for inclusion as a fvwm module.  Sorry, i'm no programmer
and therefore regrettably can't do it myself. :-(

                                      Thank you, P. *8^)

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


I am an X newbie and am having lots of trouble getting to understand
how to use my XFree86 windows.  I read on this list about using "desk"s
and "page"s and I am not at all sure what these are.

I am accustomed to mwm on aix, but I have not figured out what all the
different icons on the fvwm window frame do, or where to find the
appropriate resource and configuration files for fvwm.

Can somebody please point me to a source of beginner's user guide for
fvwm?  If there is a good book out there I would love to know about it.

I am using RedHat 4.2 on a Intel box and have the RedHat CD's.
Any help will be most appreciated.

XFree86 is just an implementation of the X Window System for x86 machines.
Desks and Pages are an artifact of the window manager, in this case fvwm.

The window frame buttons depend on your configuration of fvwm.

In that case you're probably on fvwm-2.0.45. Look at the docs in
/usr/doc/fvwm2-2.0.45-3, then read the fvwm2 man page, then look
at some of the example configs on the web pages given in the FAQ and
on the fvwm home page.

Then just play around with all the settings and see what happens.
That's the fun part :-)

I don't know if that is possible, but FvwmIconMan has been especially
written to allow that.  It works a bit like the @% taskbar -- the
buttons are made narrower to accomodate more columns when the given
space becomes full.

Want a screeshot?

I hope I did it right, MIME-wise.  The FvwmIconMan is on the right
hand side.  It is with mini icons, as you can see.

Well, thanks once again to those who have helped me -- Problem #1 has
been solved -- I managed to get the xclock in FvwmButtons at a decent
size.  My problem was that I had an Icon command in there as well -- I
think I read somewhere that this was the appropriate way to call an
xclock, but apparently it's not.  Anyways, problem solved.

Regarding my query about being able to start a window on a particular
page: I failed to include the following information: I'd like to be
able to start a window on a different page without having to GoTo that
particularly page, something that can be done in the background.  When
I'm working on a particular project, I like to open several
applications all at once, and have them appear on different pages of
my Desk, but I'm only interested in seeing/starting out on one of
those pages....  Make sense?

Anyways, it's not too big of a deal, and I can sort of work around it
using -geometry to push the applications off of the current page.

My .fvwm2rc is now running smoothly and I'm ready to switch over
full-time.  Thanks to those who helped.

Ever since I switched to Fvwm2 2.0.46 from 2.0.45, my FvwmButtons has stopped
working.  I changed nothing in my config file pertaining to it.  Everything
compiled without any trouble (on my SunOS 4.1.3 with gcc 2.7.2 and X11R6, not
OpenWIndows).

I used the sample file that came with the module source, and it starts the
clokc, but the buttons never appear.  I've watched my processes with 'top' on a
1 second resolutoin, and I am some times lucky enough to see FvwmButtons pop in
for one cycle (I think I hear it laughin at me too...).  I don't seem to get any
error messages or anything.  I looked through the source, and I didn't see any
exit(...) statements NOT preceeded by an error message, so I'm baffled as to why
or where its exiting.

Has anyone has similar trouble?  Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can
track this problem down?

Brian.

Did you install the 2.0.46 modules in the same place, as 2.0.45?
If not, do you have a "ModulePath" in your .fvwm2rc?`

I've installed all of the new modules right on top of the old ones.  The path to
them *is* in my .fvwm2rc file.  I verified that I was running the correct
FvwmButtons by trying to execute it from the command prompt, to which it spitted
out:

FvwmButtons v2.0.46 should only be executed by fvwm!

I think I'm going to lower myself to writing error messages to a file, or
something.

Brian.

I've been working on FvwmTaskBar with the miniicons patch and Grant McDorman's
patch applied and I've found that it can be made to work correctly if you
change all the references to signal_pipe[0] to signal_pipe[1] and
signal_pipe[1] to signal_pipe[0].

The problem is that signal_pipe[0] is a read-only pipe and signal_pipe[1] is a
write to pipe and the patch has them coded backwards.

This takes care of FvwmTaskBar not responding to fvwm telling it to die (for
example, when fvwm closes or when you send it a close event.)

The only problem I'm still seeing is with the AutoHide functionality... It
looks to me as though it recieves the signal that tells it to hide itself, and
then it is getting told (By WarpTaskBar) to move back to its original position
(although I could be totally off about this...) If someone would like to look
into this...?

Must be a Unix-flavour thing. On Solaris 2.5 (my platform), both [0] and [1]
are read-write, so I picked an arbitrary direction... and, as is usual for
any 50% chance thing, I picked the wrong one <grin>. Ah well. (Yes, I did
test it - really.)

"Just mail it to the fvwm mailing list, is the best way I guess."  Hm.

Enclosed is a patch to fvwm-2.0.45 that will allow a set of menus to be
established, and then modified afterwards, by adding functions
"AddAboveInMenu", "ReplaceInMenu", and "DeleteFromMenu" to complement the
existing "AddToMenu" function. 

This is useful at my lab, because we are trying to modularize our standard
user config;  we want to be able to allow the users to change whatever
they like of their environment, while the admin staff is still able to
change the defaults and be sure that no one is inadvertently left out.

This is pretty easy in the case of shells and so forth, since each
variable can be overwritten individually.  Fvwm2 accommodates changes to
the Styles pretty well even without this patch---but as for menus, users
can only add to the end, and if they want to make minor changes to one of
the other items, well, they have to inline the whole menu, or worse, the
whole config. 

I'd appreciate any feedback from fvwm's maintainers (or anyone who knows
what they're talking about, for that matter).  Thanks,

        My StartsOnPage patch has been revised to correct the known
defects, and can be fetched from

        http://www.pcnet/com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html

        This version corrects the misplacement of StartsOnPage windows 
when the starting page is at a negative offset from the current page
and SkipMapping is also in effect, and handles the restoring of 
recaptured StartsOnPage windows to their starting pages. (It could be
argued that this latter should be optional, but it's consistent with
StartsOnDesk.)

        Any comments, suggestions, or (shudder) bug reports will be
welcomed.


        Cheers,
        Bob

to which Larry Gensch <gensch@zk3.dec.com> replied with some useful 
advice.


        Actually, a StartsOnPage style would work quite well
for your purpose. If you can give the program you start from of
your special-placement function a unique window title, like so

    AddToFunc  StartMeOnPage3
    +          "I"  Exec exec xterm -T "MyPage3Term"

then you would just specify a style something like

    Style "MyPage3Term"  StartsOnPage 1 2 0


        If you can't control the window title for the app, then what
you'd need to do in your function is to set your special page style,
then exec and wait for the window to appear, then reset to the original
style, e.g.

    Style  "ArbitraryStylename1"  ShowMapping, StartsAnywhere
    Style  "Page3"                SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 2 0

    AddToFunc  StartMeOnPage3
    +          "I"    Style  "MyProg"  UseStyle "Page3"
    +          "I"    Exec exec myprog &
    +          "I"    wait   "MyProg"
    +          "I"    Style  "MyProg"  UseStyle "ArbitraryStylename1"


        If you don't mind having FVWM switch you to the desk & page 
where the app is to be started, then Larry's suggested approach may
be even better - you don't have to go through all the style stuff.


        Cheers,
        Bob

Actually, the above isn't line wrap; the part i underlined above is the
beginning of the next `hunk' (to use patch's terminology), and the
single asterisk is actually supposed to be that way.

However, Adam's concern is somewhat valid, especially for longer
patches.  Best thing to do is to use a MIME attachment if you can.  For
shorter patches, i'd just give it a once-over to check for long lines
that might wrap.

I thought it was agreed to a while ago that patches (or anything sizable
for that matter) should not be attached, inlined, or anything... They
should be placed on an FTP server to be requested when someone would
actually want it, thereby reducing people getting pissed off by 20k gif's
in their inboxes or 200k binaries, etc...

I don't know who 'we' is, but the document you get when you subscribed asks
you not to send encoded binaries.  Patches are OK if you can get then to
come through correctly.  The list does not do line-wrapping; that is
completely dependent on the sending mailer.  If you're using something
useful instead of Netscape or its ilk you won't have problems with line
wrapping in patches.

200k binaries simply won't get through the list software; I don't allow
them.  Patches are fine as long as the patch sender has the brains to use
software that doesn't muck with the message.

It seems that rxvt doesn't recognize the -xrm option by which you can spawn a
term to start on a specific desktop. I'm currently re-organizing my workspace
in order to move to one of FvwmButtons or IconMan, so the first thing I want
to do is go from one 3x3 desk to 6 desk in a 3x2 arrangement (realistically, I
almost never used the bottom three). But I work across three systems here, and
my X initialization starts terms on each of the three windows. Before, I just
gave a high geometry to place the windows in the right space, but for desks I
need to have it start on a specific desk. I'm sure there are enough people here
using rxvt with fvwm to help me out...

While moving windows with the Move function and the mouse, I have fvwm
stop me from moving past the edge of the screen.  

But if I use the Move function non-interactively with Move w+5 w+5, so
it moves relative to the window's current position (an excellent
addition), then I can move it off the screen.

Is the [Move w+x w+x] function only available with a patch?  It doesn't
seem to work for me.  Thanks

Oops.  This only works in my Fvwm rel 45.  I think like this is yet
one more thing from the rel 45 Animated Menus patch that I no longer
have access to in rel 46.

Even Netscape's mail reader can be configured to turn off automatic

There's no need to shout like that.  I don't think Konrad has done
anything wrong.

I've got a friend running AIX 4.2. For whatever reason, he doesn't
seem to be able to get xmkmf going to make the makefile for fvwm2. Has
anyone got a Makefile that works for AIX 4.2 or 4.1.4 that he could
use? If so, please forward it to me. Thanks in advance.

I'm using FvwmCpp to preprocess my setup, and I'm using I guess you'd
call them macros, defined as follows in my fvwm2rc:

#define	FAVORITEDESKTOOL	xcalc -rpn

My FvwmButtons includes a button that when you hit it executes the program 
indicated by the FAVORITEDESKTOOL macro.  In order that users can
make their own choice of favorite desktop tool (e.g. xcalc or xman I
guess), I have written an FvwmForm module called PickDeskTool.  When
PickDeskTool is launched, the user enters the command they want executed
when the desktop-tool button is pressed.  So far so good--it actually
works.  However, as an extra bonus I would like to put the current value
of FAVORITEDESKTOOL in the input field of PickDeskTool as a default. 
Currently the input field is defined like this:

*PickDeskToolInput	DeskToolExec	40	""

The first guess I made was this:

*PickDeskToolInput	DeskToolExec	40	FAVORITEDESKTOOL

but that gets me a blank input field, as do all the other versions I've
tried (such as replacing FAVORITEDESKTOOL with \FAVORITEDESKTOOL).

Anybody done something similar before?

Hi,

    I've read the FAQ and a lot of the Mail archives and the rest of the
fvwm documentation. I've compiled fvwm2.0.46 on my SGI Indy (IRIX5.3) and
there are three things that don't work:

1) when firing up GNU emacs, the emacs window stops opening and I have to
click with Mouse 1 to get it to continue opening - I just have the
following emacs-related entries in my ~/.fvwm2rc file:

Style "*"           SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement, NoOverride
Style "*emacs*"     WindowListHit, NoPPosition

I've tried other style flags without success

2) *FvwmWinListTruncateLeft doesn't look any different than TruncateRight
for long WindowList entries

3) neither *FvwmWinListFocusBack or *FvwmWinListFocusFore work for any
color I choose

    Any ideas?

    Thanks!

        Alan

I'm having some trouble compiling FVWM on the Data General (junk)
systems that I use here in my office. I had compiled a previous version,
though I don't remember which rev. that was. I'm trying to compile 1.24r
and running into the following problem.

I'm logged in at super user and I try to compile fvwm. I get the
following error and bail out of the compile.

I am having a little trouble getting ClickToFocus to work right.
I think I got it to work on everything now but TkDesk.
When I have a bunch of TkDesk windows open (editor, info) the
ClickToFocus doesn't work on it right.  Is this a TkDesk thing or FVWM?
TkDesk is nowhere in my .fvwm2rc file.

Is there any way to define a variable in the .fvwm2rc file that can be
expanded at run time?  Something like the #define directive in C?  I
would like to put in a line something like:

#define START_ICON mini-x.xpm

And have START_ICON replaced with mini-x.xpm every time it is
encountered.  This way I could define an icon once and have it used
everytime.  It would make changing the icon for a particular program
much simpler too.

You should investigate the preprocessing modules FvwmCpp and FvwmM4.
But I don't see that this saves you much effortexcept in changing to a
better icon than mini-x.xpm for a group of programs. For a single
program it's much the same having to write START_ICON each time.

Indeed.  Just about the only thing that doesn't behave quite as you might
expect is adding things to the Init and Restart functions.

In this particular example perhaps, though even for the individual user it
still makes sense to use "symbolic constants" for all the usual good reasons.

Where having a preprocessor available is invaluable, though, is in
constructing a customisable configuration for a large heterogeneous body of
users.  (I'm trying to do it at the moment.)  Some of them will use any old
thing that you give them.  Some groups need particular facilities turned on or
off by default.  Some of them like to fiddle with anything they're given.  And
some of them just want to do their own thing.

Hi

Does a module exist that allows a shell script to send commands to fvwm
(e.g. via a named pipe)?

I use an alias called 'ec' to call the emacsclient program, and it would
be really useful if it could focus my emacs server window too.

Hi,

I'm having some problems compiling fvwm2.0.46 on a hpux 10.20 system.
I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about what it going wrong.

I'll admit up front that I'm new to both fvwm and hpux...

xmkmf and "make Makefiles" don't seem to do anything obviously wrong,
but when I try the actual make I get mounds of errors.

making all in ./libs...
        cc +O3 +OS -Wp,-H200000   -I. -I/libs  -I/usr/X11R5/include  -DSYSV   -DSHAPE -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS -DINACTIVE_BTNS -DMINI_ICONS -DVECTOR_BUTTONS -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS -DMULTISTYLE -DEXTENDED_TITLESTYLE -DBORDERSTYLE -DUSEDECOR -DWINDOWSHADE -DXPM  -c Picture.c
cc: warning 450: Unrecognized option +OS.
cpp: "Picture.c", line 33: error 4036: Can't open include file 'X11/xpm.h'.

xpm.h obviously doesn't exist (where fvwm expects it to, at least).  Is this
something that I should go pester the sysadmins about or is it normal for 
hpux 10.20?  Is there a possible workaround?

Also, I see things like:

making all in ./fvwm...
        rm -f builtins.o
        cc -c +O3 +OS -Wp,-H200000   -I. -I../libs  -I/usr/X11R5/include  -DSYSV   -DSHAPE -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS -DINACTIVE_BTNS -DMINI_ICONS -DVECTOR_BUTTONS -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS -DMULTISTYLE -DEXTENDED_TITLESTYLE -DBORDERSTYLE -DUSEDECOR -DWINDOWSHADE -DXPM  -DFVWM_ICONDIR=\"/usr/X11R5/include/X11/bitmaps\:/usr/X11R5/include/X11/pixmaps\"  -DFVWMDIR=\"/usr/X11R5/lib/X11/fvwm2\"  -DFVWMRC=\".fvwm2rc\" builtins.c

After this it is just more of the same for the different modules.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance,

I'm using the latest version of fvwm2. With some applications, such as
exmh, I have multiple windows associated with the main application. For
example, I have the main exmh window plus a separate window which has my
folder listing. When I iconify the main window, I'd like the folder
window to iconify also. And when I de-iconify the main window, I'd like
the folder window to de-iconify. I know some window managers (such as
ctwm) do this automatically. Is there a way for me to have fvwm2 do
this?

Curious...
I'm using fvwm 2.0.46 on HPUX 9. Before I upgraded to this version,
using 2.0.45, when I minimized a window, the icon would set to the bottom
left of my screen. 

Here's the icon region of my .fvwm2rc:
############################################################################
# ICON Setup

Style "*" IconBox +0-64-1-1

Style "*" StickyIcon

############################################################################

Now, however, with version 2.0.46, the icon places at the top right of
where the window existed; that is, until I do a "Restart fvwm", then it
places it at the bottom left. 
I would like it to always place at the bottom left.

Is there a style definition that I am overlooking? Anyone have a quick and
easy solution to my little problem?
Thanks in advance, 
Gord Stickney.

Hi Gord,

here is what I use for bottom left placement:

Style "*" DecorateTransient,IconBox 0 -100 600 -0

I'm actually not sure what "DecorateTransient" does, but that places my
icons exactly where you want them.

Thanks David.
The key is to have the spaces in between the placement parameters.
ie. I had 0-64-1-1; works with 0 -64 -1 -1

The "officail" page for fvwm needs a list of mirror sites for getting
fvwm.
I am trying to download and getting access denied errors from the ftp.
Says it is too full.

>=20

There is a module called FvwmCommand available at
 =20
 www.concentric.net/~isogai/fvwm2/fvwm2.html

(FvwmCommand come with 2.0.46 probably will not compile as it is.)
(I also have to update the one on my site for SunOS.)


Put it under extra directory of fvwm2 source. Untar it, then run
xmkmf
make
make install
make install_man.=20

A man page and samples scripts are in the package.

   The 'DecorateTransient' will give "transient" windows a titlebar.
   An example of these "transient" windows is Netscape's "question"
   windows or Netscape's "Save As" window (or dialog box).

This is not possible by default; it is a bug.  You can make a
workaroud: define a title for the button and an action.  Then,
pressing the mouse button on the title (but not on the swallowed
application) will execute the action.

FvwmCDE is a fvwm2 module which mimics the appearance and some of the
functions of the standard CDE taskbar.  It's based on the XForms
library.  It's home page should be

http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/unixcentral/FvwmCDE.html

but I'm not able, as of now, to reach that host.

I rather like FvwmCDE, I'm using it all the time...  Latest version I
know of is something like 1.5.

eheh, Panel is *another* attempt at the same thing.  It's Motif based,
and its home page is on

http://www.d.umn.edu/~mbaron/panel/

It's worth a look, too  :-)

I am not a fan of visible IconBoxes as they take up valuable 'real
estate'.  However,  I do like to have some control over icon
placement.   I currently use the style - IconBox setting to send my
icons to a region at the bottom of the screen.  My question is,  set
this somehow such that the icons fill from left to right along the
bottom then,  when bottom is filled, start placing left to right just
above them ?  ie filling from the bottom.

I thought I saw something on this a while ago but cant find it in the
mail archive.   Any hints?



( by the way - Any chance of removing the annoying FVWM FVWM pink
background on the mail archive search result - It make reading the list
almost impossible?  Backgrounds only serve to produce interference with
characters and don't seem to serve any useful purpose? )

I was able to compile on HP-UX 9.xx by grabbing the xpm libs, compiling
them in a local directory for use, and then giving the path as part of the
LOCAL_LDFLAGS environmental pointer for the linker.  My "gccopts"
single-line script (I don't use this often enough to remember it without
such help) is:

setenv LOCAL_LDFLAGS "-I/usr/user2/tiefen/lib -L/usr/lib/X11R5
-L/usr/user4/tiefen/Xpm/lib -L/usr/user2/tiefen/lib"

(The mailer has split the command onto 2 lines, please note.)  Any other
and better suggestions from others I will probably incorporate in place of
this.  By the way, dynamically linked things such as this remember where
the lib is.  I don't know enough about how these things are found by the
loader to understand this, but when I compiled fvwm2 on another system
with a different xpm path and copied the binaries over to the target
system, the loader couldn't find the xpm lib in my directory hierarchy.  I
had to do a compile and link locally before it could get it correctly.
However, I couldn't find an explicit path to the xpm lib in either
executable with "strings".  To me, it is a mystery....

Is this really a bug?  I would like the option to have either property.
Maybe a boolean called something like PassFocusToApp (which with the
current behavior is always true).

HI!

The completely new syntax in the latest versions makes it possible (e.g. 
redhat's fvwm-2.0.45.rpm --- I don't know FvwmButtons' version), but there's a
bug. If you click, you have to click at the edge of the swallowed xload. Or
anywhere in xload press Enter. 

Being a new member of the list, (this is my first email here), somebody please
help me. I've written a list of suggestions and new ideas, and a list of bugs.
Where shall I send it? Is this list read by people who will fix the bugs?

bye,
 KOBLINGER Egmont   from Budapest.

OK, I take that back and call it a missing feature.

Good morning,

The best way IMO is to use the "-name" parameter to xterm (and many other
X apps) and then you can use distinct Style commands.

Can somebody tell me the way to quote a newline as a regular expression?
I'm doing a few tricks with FvwmM4 and I need to remove a newline from the
end of a string.  I was planning on using the patsubst macro.  Thanks.

I think someone put some changes in that broke these settings. I hope to
look at it Real Soon Now (no, I am not the author of that module, but
I did put the above enhancements in). 

I believe the changes are related to mini-icons.

Speaking of which, I'm putting together a CDE mock right now, one that
uses nothing special but a few tcl/tk scripts.  It is not the most
sophisticated thing ever, and not that terribly close to CDE really, but
it looks nice and mimics the general layout and organization.  Anybody
wants to try it, let me know.  It should be done in maybe a week, assuming
somebody tells me how to make M4 strip a newline character from the end of
a string.

Dear all,

At home, I have two places I run X from on the same network. One of these, the base system, is
an ATI SVGA card with 4MB of memory, which handles many, many colors without blinking an
eyelash. The other is an NCD17c Xterminal, which is, as near as I can guess, 256 colors at
best.

What I am wondering is, short of having 2 .fvwm2rc files, is there a way in that file I can
have it set and do certain things based on which of these machines the display is? Such as
displaying a color-intense .XPM file on the console, and a greyscale embossed version of it
(Which is already mde) if its the NCD?

Any help appreciated.

Jamie

FvwmM4 can do it.  M4 is a macro processing language that has access to
the environment.  It works a little  bit like cpp.

You will have to change the way that you invoke fvwm, but that is not much
of a problem.

I think FvwmCommand has to run from Fvwm, like any other module?

For a non-module process to send commands to Fvwm, for now you would have to
run FvwmPipe, or if the command is dedicated to just returning data for Fvwm,
you couls use PipeRead in a function. I've tried using FvwmPipe, but the wait
loop it goes into instantly boosts my server's load by a full point.

Is it possible to have certain icons without a label? I'd like the label

I have compiled fvwm2.0.46 also.  But under 5.x.  The button bar
doesn't work.  I am getting core dumps.

No. Here is its README file.

FvwmCommand is an interface to send commands to Fvwm=20
from processes which are not Fvwm modules.

Version 1.4

- Returns error messages and Fvwm window transaction. Its output can
  be used for scripts.

- Uses fifo instead of inet port. Multiple users can use FvwmCommand
  without interference. Also multiple FvwmCommands can be used for
  background jobs.

- Exits cleaner. It erases files it creates.


Examples

  test1.pl      - takes 1 argument  't' to invoke FvwmTalk
                                    'td'  to kill FvwmTalk
                                    ''  to move windows
  test2.sh      - takes 1 argument  'b'  to invoke FvwmButtons
                                    'kb' to kill FvwmButtons
                                    'r'  to change # of button rows
                                    'c'  to change # of button columns
  ex-auto.pl    - auto raise small windows. It will keep them visible.
  ex-cascade.pl - cascade windows, then move them back.
  ex-grpmv.pl   - choose a group of windows to move together.

  Above examples are not meant to be practical but to show how it can
  be done.

  focus-Netscape.pl =20
      Focuses pop-up windows, such as 'open URL' or 'find' whenever=20
      opened up. This let the user to type in immediately without=20
      moving mouse. This script also moves 'download' window to the=20
      right edge to keep it visible. If this is invoked from=20
      .fvwm2rc, use as:

          AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec $HOME/scripts/focus-Netscape.pl=
 &

  push-away.pl <direction> <window name>
      Pushes windows away to avoid overlapping. use as:

          push-away.pl up 'Fvwm Pager' &



Your comments will be appreciated.

1) You'll need to get the Xpm library.  Try ftp.x.org or sunsite.unc.edu
(or a mirror)  Once you get it compiled, you may wish to just install it
in $HOME/lib and then add -L$HOME/lib to the compiler define in Fvwm.tmpl.

You'll probably use the Xpm library many more times for other programs
(such as xscreensaver, asclock, etc.)

2) Check the compiler you're using.  If it came bundled with HPUX, it's
not ansi and may give you are hard time.  If you have a development
machine I'd suggest investigating and giving that compiler a try instead.

		OR
Take a deep breath - and get gcc.  The gcc compiler will make your life
much easier for many projects.  Unfortunately, getting gcc compiled will
take a lot of patience.  I'm including an attachment from dejanews about
how to compile gcc on HPUX 10.20 .  I took this route.  BTW, anyone using
HP-UX 10.20, your sed is broken :)  -- Check the attachment.

3) If your still getting errors, search dejanews.  There's been a fairly
good flurry concerning HPUX 10.20 and compiling in general.

I just wanted to say thank you to all the people who provided such quick
and useful responses...

I installed Xpm, and forced fvwm to compile using gcc, and that seems to 
have gotten rid of most of the problems.

Right now it compiles, but I'm getting warning messages for many modules
along the lines of:

Parse.c:28: warning: assignment discards `const' from pointer target type

builtins.c:681: warning: passing arg 2 of `GetOneArgument' from incompatible 
pointer type

Should I be worried about this at all?  Is this normal behavior?

I'm not on terminal right now, so I can't check it the quick and easy way
by just running the executable.

Thanks again,
Robert

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


For some compatibility reason with some old Linux machines
where fvwm 1.23b is running and since the .fvwmrc's must 
stay for a while I'm in the need of finding a fvwm-1.23b.tgz
for FreeBSD. 

At the moment I can help myself running the linux binary :-O 
under FreeBSD linux emulation but there is a warning about
some shared lib being not the correct minor number. That may be
neglictable, though.

Hi,

    I've got two more questions re fvwm2.0.46 on an SGI (IRIX 5.3).

1) I'd like to run exmh iconified with only an icon title (since the title
changes when mail arrives). However, instead of just getting the icon title
I get the icon title plus a blank light gray rectangle attached above it:

                __________
               |          |
               |          |
               |          |
               |__________|
               |          |
               |   EXMH   |
               |__________|


Is there a way to get the icon title without the icon? I've tried:

Style "exmh"        IconTitle, NoIcon

which just unmaps as per the manual.

2) Some of my windows are offset vertically (offscreen) by the titlebar
height - I've tried different combinations of style commands.

    Thanks!

        Alan

Is there a way for the FvwmIconBox to only show icons that represent
iconified things? I don't need to see icons representing things that are
open, and in fact it's a nuisance to me. If that can't be done, is there
a way to at least sort things by whether they are open or iconified?

This  file should  have been  created when you  did  make.  Instead of
doing make install, do make from the  top of the  tree.  At some point
you should see it go into the libs directory and do a make.  This make
should create the libfvwm2.a file.

Then do make install.

My X startup script is called .Xclients.  I have always chosen my startup
programs by putting them in this file, and starting the window manager at
the end.  It has always worked.

Now I am invoking fvwm2 with the command

exec fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -debug /usr/local.....

It works very well, except for one thing.  The correct colors and buttons
(styles, actually) are not being applied to the windows that appeared 
before fvwm2 started.  Now if I take the .fvwm2rc file created by the
-debug option above, put it in my home directory, and change my fvwm2
invocation in .Xclients to

exec fvwm2

Those windows get the correct styles when fvwm2 starts.

Get it?

Now if I restart fvwm2 from the session where the correct styles were not
applied to the old windows, those styles are applied after the restart is
done.

Without putting the programs I want in my InitFunction can anybody tell me
how to get the correct styes to apply to existing windows when M4
preprocesses my startup file?

One of my former colleagues had this problem.  His solution was to put
a recapture at the end of his initfunction.  That seemed to do the
trick for him.  I can't say for sure as I've got a winning streak
going when it comes to this race.

Thanks a million; that sort of works.  Still not sure if I need
UpdateDecor, but it looks good...

Okay, the whole story.  Regardless of the situation, if I use M4, old
windows don't get the correct styles without Recapture.  But there's
another snafu:  if you invoke FvwmM4 from .fvwm2rc, InitFunction does not
happen unless you explicity put the command "InitFunction" somewhere in
your set-up.

Can you send messages as plain text instead of HTML?

Anyway, your message requires some mind-reading.  Apparently you are
starting fvwm and some parts of your set-up work while others do not.
What kind of .fvwmrc file are you using?  Your problem could just be 
caused by an incorrectly-arranged FvwmButtons (GoodStuff?) or something.
You have checked execute permissions on what?  Please clarify.  Your
problem could be caused by the wrong READ permissions on something as well
as it could be caused by the wrong EXECUTE permissions on a module.  What
version of fvwm are you using?

Ugh,  something about the way you sent that message caused by mailer
to launch netscape to show the message.

>From what I can see, it looks like fvwm started, but when it tried
to launch a module, you got the permission denied message.  Check the
ModulePath in your .fvwm2rc.

Now that I am opting for multiple one-page desktops instead of my old
multi-page single desktop, I'd like a pager more like the one in TkGoodStuff,
that is, where each desktop is a single button without window outlines,
preferably labelled. I'd like it to allow me to change desks, with colors
changes to note the current desk, but I want it to be much much smaller than
FvwmPager is for my 3x2 arrangement. Is there a feature I have overlooked
already out there?

I think so.  Just say "DesktopSize 1 1" and bind the commands "Desk 0",
"Desk 1", ... to buttons in FvwmButtons.  For the color changes you can
use FvwmBacker.  This all assumes you're using fvwm2.

I think the reason for that is that FvwmM4 (and FvwmCpp) is a module which
gets run as a separate process.  fvwm2 fires it up, doesn't bother waiting,
carries on to the end of the rc file and executes the InitFunction.  Some time
later FvwmM4 (FvwmCpp) gets round to adding to the InitFunction (you can see
it in the processed output if you use the -debug option) but by then it's too
late.  It would be nice if fvwm2 could be told to wait...

Running it as 'fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 your.m4.file"' works, btw (or at least, it
does for FvwmCpp).

How to hide the "bar  with icons" underneath application windows in
the following windows managers: fvwm2, fwvm95 ?
 For now the application windows are partly covered by
the "bar with icons" .
 In fvwm the "bar with icons" is hidden underneath application windows
but I cannot figure out how to achieved the same in the other wms listed
above.

Could some good soul help me ?


If would be so kind please send the answer to 'krupa@alpha.sggw.waw.pl'

Thanks in advance.

I use fvwm2.  I believe you are referring to the taskbar.  The
behavior you want is the default so I believe you are overridding it.
Since I want the opposite behavior, I do override the default with
StaysOnTop.  So, I have the following line in .fvwm2rc

Style FvwmTaskBar	ClickToFocus, NoHandles, Sticky, StaysOnTop

You want

Style FvwmTaskBar	ClickToFocus, NoHandles, Sticky

Hope this helps,

  Hi

No, he refers to the FvwmButtons (TaskBar isn't functioning under
fvwm, I think).

However, a general receipt for what Gottlieb explained for FvwmTaskBar
is:

identify the window which always gets put on top. For this you can use
FvwmIdent or xwininfo. Take the name of the window from this
information and go in your .fvwmrc or .fvwm2rc and find the line(s)
containing something like

Style "<your_window_name>" <other_opts>, StaysOnTop, <other_opts>

and take out the StaysOnTop command.

Hi, all.

Looking for reasons that tcl7.4/tk4.0 and fvwm2.045 disagree about
some geometry (location} issues.  It appears that the windows created
by tk are located without accomodating the borderwidth, particularly
if the geometry spec is negative (from bottom or right edge of the
screen).  tk winfo requests sometimes are answered with borderwidth
included, sometimes not.  Anyone else have experience with this?  I've
also seen something similar with fvwmIconMan.

(I am preparing test cases, if anyone is interested.)

I've only been following the mailing list for a couple of weeks, and
haven't seen anything about this.  Pointers, consolation, support, or
suggestions solicited!

Thanks,
Donald.

Thank you very much. It's solved my problem.

Another questions:
 I can not figure out how to configure fvwm,fvwm2,fvwm95 to be able

1. to move the taskbar from one place to another (with icons) using mouse.
2. to iconify the taskbar using mouse (similarly like in AfterStep
   I can click on the taskbar to iconify it or the other possibility
   is to click on upper frame of taskbar to scrollup it-I am sorry
   for my english, maybe you can guess what I mean)
   but I prefer to use fvwm because it uses less memory, colors,...

Thanks in advance

I only use fvwm2.  There is no problem in moving or iconifying the
taskbar.

What I do is have a popup menu from the root window that has a
submenu called window ops.  The window ops submenu has both move and
iconify actions.  When I select one of them, say move, my mouse
pointer changes shape.  I can then click on any window, for example
the taskbar, and move it.  Same for inconify.

Simplier would be to have move and iconify on the main menu.  First I
show the simplier way and then my way.

First bind a mouse butto to popup the menu when pushed in the root
window.  I use mouse button 1.

Mouse 1 R       A       Menu Main-Menu Nop

Then make a main menu with move and iconify

Subject: FVWM: StartsOnPage patch - update
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


        My StartsOnPage patch now looks pretty solid - I've been running
the latest version for about a week with no, er, surprises. I'd welcome 
any comments from testers, both as to its stability, and more importantly,
as to how people think it *ought* to behave.

        It's rather large (36K), so I'd rather not spam the mailing
lists with repeated versions. It can be fetched from

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPatches.html


Usage:
------

1) New Style:
      Style StartsOnPage d x y
   where d = the target desktop, and x and y = the x and y page
   numbers.
   If only one arg is used, it works like StartsOnDesk.
   If 2 args, they specify the page with no desk preference.
   It shares the StartsOnDesk Style flag, so you don't have
   to give up some other style. Existing StartsOnDesk code is
   used, where possible, without functional modification: 2 small
   exceptions are noted below.
2) 3 temporary GlobalOpts pairs for customizing its behavior
   (defaults appear first):
     CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
     RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage/RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage
     StartsOnPageHonorsUSPosition/StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition
   I personally think that 2 of the 3 options are a bit of overkill,
   but I put them in to allow testers (including myself) to try out 
   different behaviors to see what they really find useful.


How It Behaves:  (rather well, actually)
---------------

1) StartsOnPage is honored for initial placement of new
   windows, and for initial capture of windows existing
   prior to startup.
2) By default, StartsOnPage (or StartsOnDesk) placement *is not* 
   honored during a Restart or Recapture, but this can be 
   overridden by GlobalOpts RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage.
3) If SkipMapping is not also specified, fvwm will switch to
   the target desktop (if specified) and page (if specified),
   except during initial startup, or during a Restart or
   Recapture.
4) By default, StartsOnPage placement *does not* modify
   USPosition, which means that apps started with a geometry
   spec (and SkipMapping) will probably appear somewhere other
   than the page you intended. This can be overridden by 
   specifying GlobalOpts StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition.
5) ActivePlacement does not honor StartsOnPage (perhaps it should).


To Do:
------

1) SmartPlacementIsFiendishlyClever (see caveat below)
2) Decide whether this should be merged with StartsOnDesk or kept as
   a separate Style. (Chuck - got any strong opinions on this?)
3) Decide which options to keep or remove. (Ibid.)


Caveats:
--------

1) There is one change in the behavior of StartsOnDesk: by
   default, StartsOnDesk *no longer* moves a window back to its starting
   desktop on a Restart/Recapture. (Initial capture on startup does
   as it has always done.) If you dragged it to another desk, there it'll
   stay, unless you override the default. (I think someone recently
   expressed a wish for such a change.)
2) StartsOnPage in conjunction with SkipMapping introduces a
   new, undocumented setting, SmartPlacementMaySeemCapricious. Until I
   (or anyone who cares to volunteer) have some time to tinker with the
   Smart/Clever placement code, a StartsOnPage window is positioned
   within the target page at a spot appropriate for the page you're
   currently on, not necessarily the one where it's about to be placed.
3) The name_list struct now carries the desk no. as 1-relative, not
   0-relative, so 0 means "don't care", not "the first desk". It is
   still stored 0-relative in the FvwmWindow struct, so most of Fvwm
   is unaffected. If anyone knows of any module code that cares about
   the internal Style representation of the desk no., please let me
   know.

Hello,
	I'm a long time lurker and finally run across something I haven't
been able to find an example of.  Can FvwmScroll not be swallowed?  I ran
through the mail archives and only found one occurrence of someone asking
a similar question, but no answer.
	I am trying to have scrollable buttons within another FvwmButtons.
>From a function, I create a button bar, wait for it and then put a
ScrollBar around it.  However, the parent button bar will not capture the
buttons.  It does seem to adjust its location.  If I remove the Wait, the
buttons are captured normally, but without a scrollbar.  I'm assuming
FvwmScroll exits before the buttons are created without the wait.
	I've used FvwmIdent to make sure the names are correct.  Any
ideas?

TIA

Why?

I think it's cool that you get menus "for free".

Why not?  The fvwm menus are sufficient, I think.  You can tell
FvwmButtons to pop up such a menu when a button is clicked on.

I've also noticed the same problem with StaysOnTop windows. I have a
procmeter swallowed in an oversize FvwmButton, and the first click
always leaves the menu beneath my FvwmButton. I guess the click that
focusses my FvwmButtons (I use ClickToFocus) also Raise's my
FvwmButton, but only *after* sending the click to procmeter and
mapping its menu? No big deal, but while we were on the topic, thought
I'd chime in. Oh, fvwm2.0.46 on Linux 2.0.29, AX2.1, though I expect
it's not specific to anything I have...

I'd be grateful if someone out there could help me with a little niggle
I have with FvwmButtons and fvwm 2.0.45.

my setup at the moment is as follows :

*FvwmButtonsFore Black 
*FvwmButtonsBack lightgrey
**FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmButtonsGeometry 720x76-2-2
*FvwmButtonsRows 1

*FvwmButtons(Swallow coolmail	'Exec coolmail -e "" -f /var/mail/lwillis -geometry 76x76-100-100 -int 20 -fr 60 &')
*FvwmButtons(Swallow xclock	'Exec xclock -fg black -bg lightgrey -hd red -hl red -geometry -1000-1000 &')
*FvwmButtons(3x1, Swallow perfmeter  'Exec perfmeter -g -S -H -geometry +1048+0 -bg lightgrey -fg #660066 &') 
*FvwmButtons(3x1, Swallow xdaliclock 'Exec xdaliclock -12 -nocycle -noseconds -bg lightgrey -fg black -geometry 280x80+0+0 &') 

Everything works fine except that when I first start up the performance
meter doesn't appear and the button is pressed in (All the others are
up!)
It's not a problem with the path as I've tried including the absolute
path name in the Exec bit, and when I copy the perfmeter -g -S -H
etc. to an xterm and run it from there it runs, and Fvwm swallows it
fine, but I can't seem to get it to start when I start (or restart) my
Fvwm

Any ideas gratefully accepted ...

Lee.

Here's a newbie question for you. What do you mean by the term
"swallowing". I would also like to know if there exists a more in-depth
document describing configuring fvwm, than the FAQ. I did get TkGoodStuff
installed, but it doesn't work completely. BTW, I am on a Solaris 2.5.1
Sparc10.

TIA for any pointers and tips!

regards,

Cliff Trapp

FvwmButtons can contain buttons which execute fvwm commands (mostly to start 
programs, but it's up to you really).  It can also swallow windows.  For 
example, I have an xclipboard, a couple of xloads, an FvwmPager and an oclock 
in my FvwmButtons.  For things that you know are going to be on your screen 
almost all the time, it makes sense to have them tied together, without their 
own titlebars.

fvwm comes with manpages ("make install.man").  These are all pretty terse, 
however.  There are example configuration files around the place.  fvwm is 
quite popular amongst Linux users, too, and there are a few tutorial type 
things directed towards that, most of which should be pretty much the same for 
Solaris.

Hi,

is there any way to create, with either FvwmButtons or FvwmWharf (this 
is fvwm 2.046) to create an L shaped button bar? Here is some ascii art to
represent what I'm after:

|-------------|
|        |___ |
|           | |
|           |_|
|             |
|             |
|-------------|

is this possible? Either by arranging fvwmbuttons somehow, or by creating
a "transparent" button (the lower-left) which would show the desktop and
pass all events to the window manager.

Any suggestions are welcome,

Ok, the Netscape Communicator has that little buttonbar with the 4
buttons on it.
At the moment I make it sticky so it follows me arround, but how do I
get fvwmbuttons or tkgoodstuff to swallow just that part of netscape?

Most X apps require double quotes around command line options that have a
# character.  Try

*FvwmButtons(3x1, Swallow perfmeter 'Exec perfmeter -g -S -H -geometry
+1048+0 -bg lightgrey -fg "#660066"'

You don't need to put & after any Exec stuff in fvwm2, by the way.

   I see your point.  And I agree with your argument.  Indeed the different
   colours would be 'annoying' to some extent.
   
   But not sure if I have an answer for you. :>   Anyone else?

I suspect it may be a problem with the way you specified the

name for the colour. Try using the alternative option 

-Wf red green blue

where red/green/blue are _decimal_ not hex values from 0-255.

Hello,

I've problems with shaped windows. I'm using ImageMagick to display
and manipulate images. Images with transparent colors are displayed
as shaped windows (on TrueColor displays). But there's one problem,
when doing this:

1) loading a transparent image
2) loading a non-transparent image
3) resizing the non-transparent image to double size

After that there's only the upper left quarter of the image (exactly
the size of the original non-transparent image) visible. When moving
around the window the "moving border" of the window is display in
the correct doubled size, but after finishing the move still only the
upper left quarter is visible again.

Since other window managers (olwm, twm, mwm) do not have problems
with ImageMagick and shaped windows, I think that's a fvwm bug.
Who can help me figuring this out ?

I've tested fvwm1.24r and afterstep-1.0pre2 on a i486 RedHat Linux
system running the XFree86 3.3.1-SVGA-Server.

Alexander

fvwm2 can't yet do this.  I'd guess the development for this ought to go in 
core fvwm as well.  On a more general point, how much does fvwm2 have to be 
hacked to produce scwm?  Is there something simple that could be done to fvwm 
to help it to be modified in this way?  It strikes me that perl users might 
want to have fvwm configured using perl, for example.

fvwm can already do this, using its module interface.  Perhaps that's 
something that's nontrivial to convert to scheme, or perhaps it just hasn't 
been a priority for the author.  There are a couple of modules which allow 
communication with fvwm and execution of almost arbitrary commands (I think 
there are some which really do have to be done at wm startup, but perhaps I'm 
wrong and all these have now been removed).

Come to think of it, couldn't the whole exercise be done by writing a fvwm2 
module in guile which converted guile statements into fvwm2 and sent them?  
(You'd need a minimal .fvwm2rc which started the module.)  Parts of this 
already exist for other languages.

Those who are interested probably have noticed that development and
even bug-fixing has slowed to a crawl over the past months.  I'm not
seeing much available time in the future, so if there's any interest,
I'd like to hand tkgoodstuff over to an interested person or group.

There is the source, along with package-maintenance scripts (e.g., for
generating distributions) and a mailing list (currently numbering 150
names).  The "Getting" page of the web site has received 16,000 hits 
since not so many months ago, so there seems to be a pretty strong
awareness of the program.  I'd be happy to consult about the code while
you are getting up to speed.

The main drawback of tkgoodstuff has always been its memory use, but
with the cheap memory these days it's starting to look a lot lighter.
With the net-awareness of tcl and the ever-spiffier tk, a scriptable
toolbar is really a powerful thing.  I hope someone will take over the
care of this one, or think about writing another from scratch.

I'll keep y'all posted.

Cheers,
Mark

 *
 * OPTION_DEFINES
 *
 * Pick and mix your desired options from this list and add them to
 * OPTIONS_DEFINES below:
 *
 *
 * -DMODALITY_IS_EVIL
 *
 * Totally disables motif applications ability to have modal dialogs.
 * Use with care.
 *
 *
 * -DNO_SAVEUNDERS 
 *
 * Tells the WM not to request save unders for pop-up
 * menus. A quick test using monochrome X11 shows that save
 * unders cost about 4Kbytes RAM, but saves a lot of
 * window redraws if you have windows that take a while
 * to refresh. For xcolor, I assume the cost is more like
 * 4Kbytesx8 = 32kbytes (256 color).
 *
 *
 * -DSHAPE
 *
 * If you want the Shaped window extensions.
 * Shaped window extensions seem to increase the window managers RSS
 * by about 60 Kbytes. They provide for leaving a title-bar on the window
 * without a border.
 * If you don't use shaped window extension, you can either make your 
 * shaped windows undecorated, or live with a border and backdrop around
 * all your shaped windows (oclock, xeyes)
 *
 * If you normally use a shaped window (xeyes or oclock), you might as
 * well compile this extension in, since the memory cost is  minimal in
 * this case (The shaped window shared libs will be loaded anyway). If you
 * don't normally use a shaped window, you have to decide for yourself.
 *
 * Note: if it is compiled in, run time detection is used to make sure that
 * the currently running X server supports it.
 *
 *
 * -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS
 *
 * Enables the ActiveDown button state.  This allows different button
 * styles for pressed down buttons on active windows (also for the
 * title-bar if EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is enabled below).  The man page
 * refers to this button state as "ActiveDown."  If not defined, the
 * "ActiveUp" state is used instead.  Disabling this reduces memory
 * usage.
 * 
 *
 * -DINACTIVE_BTNS
 *
 * Enables the Inactive button state.  This allows different button
 * styles for inactive windows (also for the title-bar if
 * EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is enabled below).  The man page refers to this
 * button state as "Inactive."  If not defined, the "ActiveUp" state
 * is used instead.  Disabling this reduces memory usage.
 * 
 *
 * -DMINI_ICONS
 *
 * Enables the "MiniIcon" Style option to specify a small pixmap which
 * can be used as one of the title-bar buttons, shown in window list,
 * utilized by modules, etc.  Requires PIXMAP_BUTTONS to be defined
 * (see below).
 *
 *
 * -DVECTOR_BUTTONS
 *
 * Enables the vector button style.  This button type is considered
 * "standard," so it is recommended that you leave it in.
 * 
 * 
 * -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS
 *
 * Enables the pixmap button style.  You must have Xpm support to use
 * color pixmaps.  See the man page button style entries for "Pixmap"
 * and "TiledPixmap" for usage information.
 *
 *
 * -DGRADIENT_BUTTONS
 *
 * Enables the gradient button style.  See the man page button style
 * entries for "HGradient" and "VGradient" for usage information.
 *
 *
 * -DMULTISTYLE
 *
 * Enables stacked button styles (also for the title-bar if
 * EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is enabled below).  There is a slight memory
 * penalty for each additional style. See the man page entries for
 * AddButtonStyle and AddTitleStyle for usage information.
 *
 * 
 * -DEXTENDED_TITLESTYLE
 * 
 * Enables styled title-bars (specified with the TitleStyle command in
 * a similar fashion to the ButtonStyle command).  It also compiles in
 * support to change the title-bar height.
 *
 *
 * -DBORDERSTYLE
 *
 * Enables the BorderStyle command.  Not all button styles are
 * available.  See the man page entry for BorderStyle for usage
 * information.  If you are also using PIXMAP_BUTTONS, you can also
 * texture your borders with tiled pixmaps.  The BorderStyle command
 * has Active and Inactive states, regardless of the -DACTIVEDOWN_BTNS
 * and -DINACTIVE_BTNS defines.
 *
 *
 * -DUSEDECOR
 *
 * Enables tagged general decoration styles which can be assigned to
 * windows using the UseDecor Style option, or dynamically updated
 * with ChangeDecor.  To create and destroy "decor" definitions, see
 * the man page entries for AddToDecor and DestroyDecor.  There is a
 * slight memory penalty for each additionally defined decor.
 * 
 *
 * -DWINDOWSHADE
 *
 * Enables the WindowShade function.  This function "rolls" the window
 * up so only the title-bar remains.  See the man page entry for
 * "WindowShade" for more information.

The instructions are:

xmkmf
make Makefiles
make
make install

(You didn't mention xmkmf.)

I saw this in many places.  That should be "#define", not "define".

Good Luck...

Hi all, I have two simple questions.

- has anybody succeeded in swallowing Netscape component-bar 
  into FvwmButtons module? 
  After a few attempts it seems that, as the component-bar 
  gets embodied into a button, it stays there unseen.  

- is it possible to launch a module in icon mode?

thank you for any comments

  Paolo> - is it possible to launch a module in icon mode?

I imagine that the module itself would have to support that as an option. But
having an application iconify itself is fairly trivial. I might think about
adding an "Iconic" or "-iconic" option to my sample X11::Fvwm Perl modules.

First of all, here is the announcement I made that these were
responses to, just so people on the fvwm list don't end up massively
confused:

Now, my response to recent comments here:

Converting the builtins themselves was relatively simple for most
cases. Some trickiness arose from the fact that all fvwm builtins get
a good deal of implicit contextual information (what window, if any
they are operating on, etc) and this was tricky to convert. However,
in doing the conversion, I have often made my Scheme procedures much
simpler than the fvwm commands they emulate, because the extra
features of the fvwm commands could be done by using normal scheme
functionality. As an example, instead of making move-pointer-to (my
equivalent of move-cursor) be able to move the pointer either
absolutely or relatively, I added a procedure that gets the current
pointer position and wrote the relative move version in scheme using
those. As another example, I wrote the Next, Prev and WindowList
command equivalents entirely in scheme based on very simple
primitives. So while a conversion _could_ be done almost mechanically,
it is a big win to give it deeper thought.

The whole exercise _could_ be done that way. In fact, I think there
are already FvwmPerl and FvwmPython modules done this way. I decided
to do it by converting the binary itself because it will eventually
save a lot of memory to be able to get rid of the fvwm parsing and
control-flow machinery, as well as all the weird features of many fvwm
commands that are there because the fvwmrc language lacks things like
conditionals and arithmetic. In fact, I think I might be able to use
less memory than fvwm2 eventually, if you don't count the guile shared
library.

Hi all,

   I just thought I'd share with all of you a little annoyance I have
   observed a few times.

   Just now my netscape 4.03 (aka communicator) froze... kept control
   of my pointer and would not allow me to shift focus to an xterm
   in order to kill it.

   I had to wait for it to release control of the pointer for about
   10 minutes!!  Is there any other solution to this but waiting
   (Short of kill the X server - or dropping to console and kill
   netscape from there).

   I kind of thend to think  this is a wm problem.
   
   Any comments on this as to why fvwm (2.0.45) would allow an X client
   to take over control???

   Is it proper to dismiss this as a problem of fvwm2?  If not are there
   any explainations as to why this would be allowed?

   If this is a wm problem does anyone see a nice little fix for it?

   I'm running fvwm 2.0.45 on Linux 2.0.0 on a i486 DX2 66 with 32MB RAM
   and 2.1 gig drive ( with plenty of swap space :)

   Thanks in advance,

Patrick ...

FWIW, this happens from me from time to time too (netscape 4.03, fvwm2
2.0.43 on both Linux and Solaris 2.5).  Seems to happen most often if I
get impatient and click a mouse button while netscape is "busy" opening
a new window. It also used to happen with older versions of netscape and
when I was running tvtwm.  I suspect netscape rather than the wm. But
know of no way to determine what's wrong.  Help?

Cheers, this seems to have solved the problem.
Thanks for all the other suggestions too.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm function bug
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi fvwm team,

I have met strange bug in fvwm behavior. In config file (nearly
default config, only some colors, menus and commands are changed)
there are defined ways to focus, hotkeys etc... After some actions (I
have not yet determined it, but probably when I am very fast in
executing some commands directly from fvwm) actions, fvwm looses some
functions and predefined keys:

This problem is not only mine and is affected to both fvwm and fvwm2
(fvwm-2.0.43), both XFree86 3.2 and 3.3 (under Linux 2.0.29).

Example of becoming buggy: I will run gv (or anything else big) from
FvwmButtons an before its window appears, I will call shell from menu.

User level solution of this problem seems to be adding in every Exec line:
Exec exec command &
(problem occurs less often)

Programs, which have problems:

xcalc: window is not focused nor by click anywhere nor by mouse
	following
xfm: icon's own menu is displayed, but item cannot be selected.
ghostview (but not gv): widgets have no answer on click.
mc (4.0): mouse support in xterm is lost at all (window becames
	clipboard area)
fvwm: Alt, Ctrl + Cursor keys are not working.
etc...

All these problems will occur in the same time in all windows. I didn't found
any way to return to correct behavior (Restart will not help, only quit
and new invocation of fvwm2),

You probably can find more problematic instances. The trouble seems,
that fvwm looses or ignores some parts of config file after executing
something.

---

Apropos: is there any option to omit interactive move measuring window?

Is this what you want?  From TFM v2.0.46:

CursorStyle context cursornum

Defines a new cursor for the specified context.  The various contexts
are:

POSITION     - used when initially placing windows
	       (XC_top_left_corner) 
TITLE        - used in a window title-bar (XC_top_left_arrow)
DEFAULT      - used in windows that don't set their cursor
	       (XC_top_left_arrow) 
SYS          - used in one of the title-bar buttons (XC_hand2)
MOVE         - used when moving or resizing windows (XC_fleur)
WAIT         - used during an EXEC builtin command (XC_watch)
MENU         - used in menus (XC_sb_left_arrow)
SELECT       - used for various builtin commands such as iconify
	       (XC_dot) 
DESTROY      - used for DESTROY, CLOSE, and DELETE built-ins
	       (XC_pirate) 
TOP          - used in the top side-bar of a window (XC_top_side) 
RIGHT        - used in the right side-bar of a window (XC_right_side) 
BOTTOM       - used in the bottom side-bar of a window
	       (XC_bottom_side) 
LEFT         - used in the left side-bar of a window (XC_left_side)
TOP_LEFT     - used in the top left corner of a window
	       (XC_top_left_corner) 
TOP_RIGHT    - used in the top right corner of a window
	       (XC_top_right_corner) 
BOTTOM_LEFT  - used in the bottom left corner of a window
	       (XC_bottom_left_corner)
BOTTOM_RIGHT - used in the bottom right corner of a window
	       (XC_bottom_right_corner) 

And the cursornum is the numeric value of the cursor as defined in the
include file X11/cursorfont.h.  An example:

	# make the kill cursor be XC_gumby:
	CursorStyle DESTROY 56

The defaults are shown in parenthesis above.

And note that the `context' below *must* be in all caps, otherwise it's
not recognized.  *groan*.  Anyone care to patch that?  I don't happen
to have the sources at the moment.

I have a module-under-development that needs to know what desk it is on when
it starts up. Outside of getting a window list, catching the ID of the module
itself, and looking at that field of the packet, is there a shorter, faster
way?

Hi,
At present I have a three buttons on the top right of my windows -
sticky, minimize and maximize. All of these have on off behaviour. I was
trying to figure out when adding a fourth button how to make it do the
following - on off behaviour for Style OnTop/NotOnTop for the window in
question - while there is a specific command in Fvwm2 for Sticky there
doesn't seem to be one for this.
Anyone any ideas on how to do this?


Cheers,
Nick

Hi guys,
    I'm currently using fvwm2 2.0.46 under Irix 6.2.  I'm having some
color map problems and some resources problems.  Once in a while,
programs will complain about not being able to allocate colors.  Now,
i'm a novice as far as color map management goes.  What could be wrong
here?

    I'm having some problems with individual apps as well.  xpaint,
for example,will not start and complains in the following manner:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  14 (X_GetGeometry)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  626
  Current serial number in output stream:  626

Whassup?  I _love_ the configurability in fvwm2, and I can always pop
back to 4Dwm, but I'd like to find out what's happening...

Confused...

I guess you have a 256-colour display? 

Basically the problem is that you can only have 256 unique colours on
screen at any one time and you've reached that limit. You're starting
up programs that require additional colours. Because you've reached
the limit they complain and insome cases crash out with the above
message. (the invalid pixmap parameter being a particular colour
specification) 

The colour map is most likely being used up by all your icons and
decorations for your window manager, and netscape. The latter is
solved by running netscape with the -install option so that it uses a
separate private colour-map. The former is solved by cutting down on
the number of colours used by your icons and window decor. Sadly the
simple rule of thumb is that the cooler something looks, the more
colours it uses. 

my setup currently uses about half the available colour entries on
start-up but still looks pretty cool... ;)

Oh and try and find a utility called availcols which tells you how
many colours you have left. 

Cheers,

Martin

What a can of worms to open.  SGI did a lot of nice(nasty) things to their
X server.  A lot of non-SGI apps just do not play well with it.

SGI allows multiple hardware colormaps.  That is, just like when you are
running on a Sun with 8 bit graphics, and the color map flashes when you
enter/leave a window, the SGI allows windows to have their own private
PseudoColor colormaps.  However, on an SGI, it is possible to have several
different color maps installed simultaneously on different windows.  It is
possible to run out of private hardware colormaps, and that might be what
you are doing.

A lot of X programs require read/write color cells, for which PseudoColor
visuals are bets.  However, many were written by folks who did not have
access to anything but PseudoColor, so that is what they use by default,
even though DirectColor of TrueColor are better suited for the
application.  xdpyinfo will tell you what visuals your server supports
(many in this case), and what the default visual is.  Perhaps some of your
applications are taking up a PseudoColor visual when they should be run
DirectColor.  Many have a -visual command line flag.  You may have to read
some man pages....

I just ran xpaint under Fvwm-2.0.45 on an Irix 6.2 Indy, no problems.  It
did complain that the default visual was only 8 bits deep though.

On another note though, I find that ImageMagick and the GIMP work much
better than xpaint, with a better interface and more features.  If you
have a 6.2 box, then you definitely have a machine capable of running
them.

Hope this helps...

Never happened to me with Netscape 4.03 final. Now, only Netsc(r)ape freezes...

It's not fvwm or *wm, it just takes a Xlib call... ;-)

I had similar problems but then applied the colorLimit patch which
worked very well - I have it set to a limit of 17 which leaves just
enough as long as I start up some applications in a certain order so
they don't grab all my remaining colours!!

I recently set up fvwm2 on my Sparc 10 running Solaris 2.5.1.
(fvwm2.046)
First I compiled and installed xpm, and then fvwm2. I now have a fairly
crude desktop that I am trying to customize. I also installed 
TKGoodStuff and it looks good but most of the icons don't do 
anything. I think most of the .tkgrc was borrowed from someone who was
on a PC. At any rate, I am having the following issues:

When I exit fvwm, it kills the window manager, but does not exit me from
my session.

The background that I set manually with xpmroot needs to start up
automatically when I login.

I exit by finding all my processes and killing them.

How do I configure FvwmButtons?

How do I change the background colors for FvwmPager?

TIA for any pointers.

Your session should end when the xinit ends, which will be when the script 
~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession finishes.  Generally, the script does some 
configuration (xrdb, etc.), perhaps launches some utilities in the background, 
and then executes a window manage in the foreground.  When that process 
finishes, the X server should shut down.  Some people run a window manager in 
the background and use some other process to terminate the session, like a 
console window or just an ordinary xterm.

You can do that in .xinitrc/.xsession, or in the initialisation functions in 
.fvwm2rc.

This shouldn't be necessary: there's something wrong.  Exiting one process 
(whichever is last launched from .xinitrc/.xsession) should be sufficient.

	Try making your own .xinitrc or .xsession file with no & after the
fvwm2 command

Other commands go in the file ~/.fvwm2rc

  Read  'man Fvwm(whatevermodule)' and put the appropriate lines in
.fvwm2rc
  Also 'man fvwm2' while you are at it.
  Good luck

Apologies in advance if this has already been answered; I pawed
through the mailing list archives and didn't see anything about it:

fvwm 1.23, linux 2.0.30.

I've got an app which pops up some windows which, under fvwm, show up
without decorations, grab bars, iconifiers, etc.  Everything else
about the windows works.  These windows also follow around the virtual
desktop, ie when you switch desktops, they stick on the screen instead
of staying back in whatever piece of desktop I created them.

Same behaviour under fvwm95.  twm and olvm work.

I pawed through some traces generated with xmon, and the only
interesting difference appears to be that the offending app is sending
a fair number of wm-hints.

Is this a known bug?  Is it fixed in any of the newer fvwms?  Please
reply directly, as I'm not on the list.  Thanks in advance for any
info.

Thanks everyone. Ordinarily I could edit either one of those, but I am
running CDE which is either misconfigured or configured NOT to use either
my own .xinitrc or my .xsession. I start up fvwm by the following entry
in my .Xdefaults file:

Dtsession*wmStartupCommand:   /usr/openwin/bin/xview/fvwm2

I ought to be able to reconfigure it work, I used to get along fairly well
before CDE came along. However, after poking around with sessionlogging in
my .dtprofile, and nosing around in /usr/dt/bin/Xsession, as well as in
/etc/dt/config, I am not much better off.

I moved my .dt directory out of the way, and it keeps coming back, another
blessing of running CDE I suppose.

Should I get out of the CDE environment, and install the X11R6, (I realize
CDE is based on X11R6) or ...?

TIA again.

In that case you need to tell CDE to log out with the command.
/usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession

At least that's how it works on HP-UX...

You'll probably want this to your .Xdefaults, which was suggested by
someone on this list:
*waitWmTimeout: 1

Also, to make it easier to debug fvwm I have one line script:
#!/bin/csh
exec /usr/local/X11/bin/fvwm2 >&$HOME/.fvwm2log

And I set the wmStartupCommand to that script, otherwise the std/err out is
lost from fvwm.

later,
jim

The way I start up fvwm2 under AIX CDE is to use the SESSIONTYPE=xdm setting
in ~/.dtprofile.  This allows me to use a more traditional ~/.xsession to
start fvwm2.  I never was able to get the wmStartupCommand variable to work
right.

In the CDE environment the following  user created files do the trick for me -
and allow me to use the sessions menu on the dtlogin screen to switch between
them as desired.  I'll show you the fvwm95 setup I use; the changes for
another window manager should be obvious :-)

You should also be able to create your own .xinitrc and .xsession files; try
selecting the openwindows session from the dtlogin screen and see if that
enables the system to see your $HOME/.* files...

And, no, I don't work in the CDE or windows groups...

	For each new window manager session configuration you want, 
	create another template file in
		/etc/dt/config/C/Xresources.d/
	with a unique name of the form "Xresources.$unique_tag"  The unique_tag
	is arbitrary and is only to alphabetize/order the entries found there.

	The property names:

	Dtlogin*altDtsIncrement:	Always leave set to "True"
	Dtlogin*altDtName:		The title displayed on the session menus
					and startup splash screen
	Dtlogin*altDtKey:		The name of a file, that if it exists,
					enables this session to be shown as
					a choice to the user.  If this file
					is not found, the choice is not shown
					on the session menu.
					This lets you predefine many session
					types, even if the  software to support
					them isn't installed on a particular
					system.
	Dtlogin*altDtStart:		The startup script for this session.
					This script is shown below, and needs
					to be customized to start the right
					window manager ...
	Dtlogin*altDtLogo:		The name of a logo to display on the
					dtlogin screen when this session is
					chosen.

I missed what OS you're running on, but I know that under the HPUX
CDE you can create a two-line file called ~/.dtprofile containing:

<blank line>
SESSIONTYPE=xdm

And it will pass control to your .xsession after you log in.  Give it
a try, perhaps it will work on your system.

Thanks again. It works the way you've described.

However in fvwm and fvwm95 I can do that not using submenu ops.
I mean: 
** I can just click on the border of the taskbar or
fvwm stuff bar and then move dragging where I want but  I can not figure out 
how to configure fvwm2 to achieve that behavior.
**
I have RedHat4.0. In the directory /etc/X11/TheNextLevel I have
many files: .fvwm2rc.modules, .fvwm2rc.buttons and so on.
I can not find which file and what I should change to have the behavior
I've described (**). It works the way you've described.

Thanks in advance

Jan

I'm sure this question has come up many times before, and I apologize for 
bringing
it up again, but I don't know where to get an answer.  I even searched the 
archives with
no success.
I'm new to UNIX and currently using CDE as my desktop.  I downloaded and untared
fvwm, but not having any luck making it my default desktop.

1. Can fvwm be added as one of my session options so I can switch back and
    forth at will?  If not, I'll settle just for fvwm.
2. Where can I get or how do I create .fvwmrc file?

Thanks to all in advance.

Hi,

I was thinking the following; I'm using Emacs with a lot of different
files and a lot of different frames. And I'd like it very much if the
icon displayed reflected the name of the frame. For instance, if I'm
editing a C-file, the frame is called foo.c. I have a FvwmIconBox
binding for "*.c" and an icon, and I want that icon displayed.

However, this only works if the window is created with the name "*.c",
and not if it changes afterwards. I think the following should be
happening:

If the Iconlabel changes, make a new lookup of the icon pixmap.

Is this easy to implement, or am I wondering the impossible?

Greetings
EJ

Dear Doctor,

I have been experimenting for a week or so using FvwmAuto (and the
default MouseFocus).  After some initial misgivings I am becoming
partial to it but ... I find that when I want to change desktops I
move the pointer over the FvwmPager and wait for the change to happen.
Where will this end?  Will I come to expect all my buttons to click
themselves when the pointer is held over them?  Maybe some bubble help
saying "Click your mouse button NOW, dummy" would ameliorate my
personal problems :-)

This should be in the FAQ by now...

What you're asking for is not currently possible, at least not
entirely.  Fvwm doesn't monitor windows for name changes and then do
the equivalent of recapture to apply new styles based on that change.
For what it's worth, IMHO it shouldn't, though there is one possible
change that I wouldn't mind seeing (see below).

That said, there's a couple things you can do that might make things a
bit easier for you if you limit yourself to emacs frames.  If you're
willing to live with bitmap icons, you can have emacs specify the icon
to use as a frame parameter and set up some hook or other to set that
parameter if the name changes in a particular fashion.  I'm not sure
exactly how to go about that, though.  The easiest thing to do is
ensure that frames are created with the name you want as you're
already aware.  There's a couple of packages out there that purport to
do this; I've only used my own dsg-frames.el so I can't give a
comparison.  

It would be nice if the monitor mode of FvwmCommand (in the extras
directory of the fvwm distribution) could, but currently there's no
way to do a recapture of a single window.  If that feature could be
added, then one could have FvwmCommand monitor all, say, emacs windows
and apply styles to them as their titles changed.  If you didn't mind
a recapture being done every time you did a find-file then maybe you
could do this today.

Hi

I think this is an excellent idea. I mean, AutoRaise is not supposed
to have any effect on the functioning of the pager, but having the
pager changing desks as it gets mouse focus on the appropriate spot,
this would be cool. And also quite confusing sometimes :-)

Let's see. A simple modification in the pager, which will configurably
replace MOUSE_CLICK event with GOT_FOCUS (yes, now you know I'm
completely illiterate about X programming) and will add a configurable
wait duration functionality could not be so difficult.

As about pager tooltips, somebody has already published here a series
of patches (I appologize, I forgot the name and I'm too sleepy now to
search in the archive).

				Friendly, Cristian

Detailed steps on how to do this should really be in the FAQ.  I've seen
three or four different suggestions as to how it should be done posted
here in the past couple of weeks, and there doesn't seem to be any
consensus on how to do it.

Actually, I've been working on a patch that may help.

Currently fvwm2 assigns an  icon box to each  window as the  window is
created.

The patch that  I have been  working on is to  allow for multiple icon
boxes like this:

Style "*" IconBox x y x y
Style "*" IconBox x y x y

This way after  the first iconbox  is filled, it would   go on to  the
second icon box and fill it.

In order for this to work, I plan to find  the appropriate icon box at
the time  the window  is iconified,  rather than  when  the  window is
created.

I believe that since fvwm2 sees the new  icon label, this patch should
place the icon in the appropriate box at iconification time.

I can't  say when this  patch will  be completed, but   I can say, its
somewhere between easy and "not impossible".

I have a problem with softwindows 4.0 and fvwm-2.0.46.

SoftWindows seems to allocate a two colormaps in the window it opens.

One for the internal border and the Menus, and one for the 
Windows95 emulation. Now when I move the cursor into the window, 
the colormap does not change. This is fine for the Motif part of the
Interface, but for the Windows Emulation the private Colormap of the window
should be used. The only way to activate this private colormap seems
to be the following:

* Open one of the Motif menus
* Slide the cursor of the menu (which now overlaps the Windows Emulation 
  area) into the Windows Emulation Area
* Now the colormap Changes and all  the colors are OK.
* once I go out of the Window, the colormap snaps back to normal.
* when I enter next time the whole procedure has to be performed again ... 

any hints ?
