1) The order matters. the last line matching either name or class wins.

2) IconOverride only works if Icon is also defined with the same pattern,
i.e. this should work:

  Style somename Icon some.xpm, IconOverride

and this does not currently:

  Style somename IconOverride

Open FvwmConsole and play with the Style commands if needed.

Mikhael.

Thanks for all the help, everyone. I discovered that on my machine,
Super_L is already bound to mod4 ('xmodmap -pm' revealed). When I
had it bound to mod3 (and then to mod2), still only the mod4 binding
worked. Does the last mod bound to a key get precedence?

Needless to say everything's working now, and I have a new set of
diagonal-up left and right keys!

This turned out to be my problem too.  clear mod4, and suddenly
everything works.

Hi,

three days ago I began useing fvwm2. It's amazing, the best and most horrible 
windowmanager I've ever seen - I was falling in love these days. Fvwm really 
rocks, thanks!!!

To AutoReplace the windows to fit correct onto the screen, I use this two 
functions - which are working really great:

AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange
 + C Iconify off
 + C All (CurrentPage Iconic) RecaptureWindow
# + C PlaceAgain Anim
 + C All (CurrentPage !Iconic !Sticky !NoTitle) PlaceAgain Anim

AddToFunc IconifyAndRearrange
 + C Iconify on
 + C All (CurrentPage !Iconic !Sticky !NoTitle) PlaceAgain Anim

Mouse 1 3	A  IconifyAndRearrange #Iconify toggle
Mouse 1 I  A  DeiconifyAndRearrange

When the Windows are replaced by PlaceAgain, it doesn't put them over the 
Sticky stuff like Pager and Icons for example. It would be nice to define 
that, for example it would be great if 'PlaceAgain' could be allowed to put 
windows above e.g. MiniBarButtons (MiniBarButtons are Style StayOnTop) - so 
it wouldn't heart at all. Is something likt this possible?

The other question, when I now use:

Style * NoIconTitle

All the Icons which are beautiful arranged at the left side were overpainted 
by other windows. 
This Fvwm 2.4.18 puts now the Windows over these Icons. :-(

Howto solve this? 

Is it possible to define a 'Stay Out OF This Geometry' ? that would help a 
lot.


Thanks for your answers
Honschu

it wouldn't heart at all. Is something likt this possible?

The other question, when I now use:

Style * NoIconTitle

All the Icons which are beautiful arranged at the left side were overpainted 
by other windows. 
This Fvwm 2.4.18 puts now the Windows over these Icons. :-(

Howto solve this? 

Is it possible to define a 'Stay Out OF This Geometry' ? that would help a 
lot.


Thanks for your answers

Hi,

I should probably make this a personal question, but since i think a lot
of users use this feature, i thought i'ld ask it publicly. 
When using taviso's rc lines for having dynamic icons for applications
when minimizing (http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/screenshot6.png), i would like 
to have that only icons are generated for applications that don't have the
NoIcon windowstyle. Is this possible ?

cheers,
Remko

You can make something up using the "State" style.  All windows
for which an icon should be generated have the state set.  You
can then trigger icon generation in a function, e.g.

  Style * state 11
  Style foo !state 11
  addtofunc my_iconify
  + i iconify
  + i thiswindow (State 11) function generate_dynamic_icon
  ...

(the syntax in above example may be wrong, I did not check it).

Ah, this should indeed do the trick. Only, when i look in the man page,
State can only be used as a command, not as a style ?

Hm, seems I forgot to code the style part.  I've checked in a
patch to provide the missing feature.

Look in the man page for the ...PlavcementPenalties styles.  They
can be used to fine tune placement behaviour.

Hi,
  I spent a few hours today getting my dual monitor setup under Linux
(Debian Woody) and XFree86, with fvwm2.

  What I've managed at this stage is the two monitors being treated as
seperate screens, running fvwm2 with thw -s switch so it only starts on
the primary, then calling another fvwm2 with minimal (no Init stuff)
from there.  Oh and Xinerama is configured on too.
  The upshot of this is two monitors work seperately, I can drag windows
between them *BUT* they are each using their own FvwmPager.  I would
greatly prefer if they were using the SAME FvwmPager, so that any
monitor can be displaying an arbitrary virtual desktop from my 3x2 set,
rather than any desktop from 2 completely different 3x2 sets.

  Is there any way to do this currently?  If not consider it a feature
request, even if it has to be with the limitation of not being able to
display THE same virtual desktop on both at the same time.  I really
don't need that myself anywya, and I doubt anyone else would.

thanks,

-Ath, who whould check the email archives for this list if they were
easily searchable, and did look in the FAQ.

As far as I understand Xinarama and multi-head, the setup you
describe is not possible.  Either you are running Xinareama and
*one* fvwm, or you have a multi-head setup and one fvwm for each
screen.  With Xinerama you can move windows to all video screens,
with multi-head you can't.

Can you please post:

 - the relevant parts of you X config
 - the lines you use to start fvwm
 - all Xinerama and Desktop settings from your .fvwm2rc

I need this information tu understand what you are doing.

  Yes, I got confused when fiddling things around attempting to get the
setup I wanted.  I do indeed have Xinerama off, as when on that just
gives me a double-width desktop across the two minitors, which isn't
what I want.

  Files attached.  Note I've switched to NOT using -s on the fvwm in
=2Exinitrc, and am instead using a "Read .fvwm2rc.<screen number>" in
~/.fvwm2rc and the relevant files in ~/.fvwm/ to get different Init
sections for the two fvwm2 instances.

> I need this information tu understand what you are doing.

  If recoding is needed I'd guess that the setup would be:

	1) Xinerama *on* so that windows can be moved between screens
	2) fvwm2 code changed to treat the two screens as seperate
	virtual desktops instead of as one double-width one.
	3) FvwmPager code changed to specify independently which virtual
	desktop is displayed on either screen.

The basic thing is to NOT have the two screens forming one virtual
desktop and to have a single FvwmPager for controlling what is displayed
on the seperate virtual desktops/screens.

thanks,

Hm, these two are very difficult to achieve because it's exactly
the point of Xinerama to treat both screens as a single entity.
I'm not saying it is impossible to do, but it is *a lot* of work.
We'd need to reparent windows in a separate 'root' window for each
screen to be able to handle them independently.  As a side effect
it would become impossible to move windows from one screen to the
other smoothly.  Then the module interface would have to be
adapted to handle not just a single desktop, but an array of
desktops - one for each screen.

Well, there may be a different way that does not really use
desktops.  Configure a key to cycle all windows on one of the
screens to a different desk, e.g.

  key f1 a n all (CurrentScreen) movetodesk +1
  key f1 a s all (CurrentScreen) movetodesk -1

Now, pressing f1 moves all windows on the current screen up by one
desk and shift-f1 moves them down.  This works only with the
latest code from cvs beccause of a bug fix I made.  It's not
perfect either, since you can not separately switch 'desks' with
the pager.

Hi everyone,

This is way off topic, but here it goes...

I'm very content about FVWM, but some programs don't comply to
conventions, I guess everyone here knows that xmms is one of them. I'm
looking for a replacement that will play mp3 and ogg, has a playlist,
but nothing fancy like visualisation plugins etc.

I'm currently browsing freshmeat, but there is a _lot_! :-)

Can anybody recommend one? What do you use?

Thanks!

Have you considered using Grip and DigitalDJ?

(http://sourceforge.net/projects/grip, http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddj)

There is the minor disadvantage that you'll have to rescan all your CDs
into the database if you didn't start out using them.

I use zinf....It works fine.  Can be as fancy or plain as you like(has
themes if you so choose).  Makes/uses playlists and catalogs your music
for you too.

How about (g)mplayer?
I think it behaves better than xmms, and should be usable to play music
also (although, personally I use xmms, think it's still nice enough to be
able to stand the troubles)

What exactly is wrong with XMMS ? I use it, but it is minimized without
an icons. I control it with shortcuts or with my gkrellm, and the
playlist of xmms is automatically filled by LPlayer
(http://lplayer.sf.net)

I've been playing a lot with FvwmIconMan these days, and I would like to
know if it is possible to display thumbnailed views of the applications
instead of static MiniIcons in FvwmIconMan.

The thumbnailing Function in Tavis Ormandy's .fvwm2rc file at
http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/fvwm2rc.html
could be a good candidate to do that but I wonder how to configure
FvwmIconMan to use that function.

If you have configured FvwmIconMan to display mini icons, you can
generate these exactly as the icons in Tavis' config.  All you
have to do is to replace "icon" with "miniicon" and maybe clean it
up a bit.  These mini icons are used by all modules automatically.

Or any suggestion or pointers.

Thanks

I am not sure to really understand what you mean.
Should I use: Style * MiniIcon and bind it to the thumbnailing function
or is there a way to override the internal Fvwm Function to produce the
miniicons ?

Greetings,

How are you? And hope all is well?

    You might be surprise to receive this mail but I will like you to 
go through it carefully before responding, I hope at the end it will 
find you and your business in the best of interest. Let me quickly 
introduce myself and the reason why contacting you is very important. I am 
Kalister Maunda; I am a senior staff at the Office of the Minister of 
Petroleum Affairs Angola.


 I have traveled along side with our Oil minister Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos
=

 to your country in search of investors that will come and invest on our =
Petroleum 
Sector, it was in one of this trip that I was opportuned to realize that the =
trips 
been made by the Minister is not for the search for investors, but for the 
search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan 
petroleum Export that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this 
discovery, but I later realized that I was the only one among other 
staffs that was not aware of these happenings, investigation into this 
matter made me to know that even the president is involved. I suddenly 
realized that the BBC and news achieve below is true.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2546281.stm

    I arrived from the trip I made with the minister and went straight 
to confront my Head of Department, and he told me that he is aware of 
the whole situation, he went further to show me some documents that was 
used to withdraw some millions of American Dollars that was meant to be 
used to pay Oil contracting Firms in Angola, he said I should assist 
him in the search for a reputable and trust worthy business man that can 
assist us in transfering the funds to a safe place where it will be 
used for Future Investment.

    I am therefore asking for your opinion on this issue, will you be 
able to assist us in transfering and claiming the money of which some 
percentage of the total amount involved will be granted to you for 
assisting us and for the time you spent on the transaction.

    If you are willing to assist us kindly provide us with details of 
how we can reach you by phone or by fax so that we can proceed to 
conclude this transaction. You can contact me on my email 
infokalister_maunda@spinfinder.com

Yours Truly,

I did it and use it. (FVWM 2.5.8 and Mandrake 9.2)

(this is for having menu automaticaly)
- I have install fvwm fvwm2 fvwm2-icons, etc... from the contrib
- I have made a copy of the file in directory /etc/X11/fvwm2/ in order to 
have a correct menu and add at the end of .fvwm2rc
Read /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc-menu
So I have a correct menu.
- I have uninstall all fvwm* rpm except fvwm fvwm2-icons


- Some *-devel package are need for compiling.
- Now I compile fvwm
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/X11R6/bin
  make
  make install

The problem was to make the fvwm2 the default WM. It's why I have left 
fvwm rpm and select as default fvwm. Its, not a pb because fvwm is a link 
to fvwm2.

Another pbs is *-devel rpm need to compile
WM binary file are in /usr/X11R6/bin directory

I use rclock from rxvt rpm instead of xclock and xbiff

pas de probleme, mais ce serait bien si j'avais plus de d=E9tails.
Je n'ai ni l'habitude de le faire, ni le temps de tatonner pour comprendr=

Je ne sais pas quels fichiers je dois chercher, ni o=F9.

si cela ne prend pas trop de temps.

J'avais essay=E9 de prendre le rpm red-hat, mais il n'=E9tait visiblement
pas content.

Par contre, si j'arrive a comprendre et executer la successions des

Hi,all.
Like everyone do ,I bind some simple Mouse behaviors to Buttons and  Icons in my .fvwm2rc file.Bindings works fine when start fvwm .Though,after about 30 minutes , defined Mouse behaviors worked no more .For examples,I get no responses when I click button 1,2,3...etc .Also no response when I double click the icon .And click mouse two in the root window can not invocate the FvwmWinList as formally did .

I try to find the reasons in file .xsession-errors :
[flamingo@openarch flamingo]$ cat  .xsession-errors |grep FVWM

I've tried to compile fvwm-2.4.8 and fvwm-2.5.10 by myself but the trouble can not be fixed.And whhen I use fvwm-themes-0.7.0-2,this problem has never occurred .
My Linux box is Redhat9.0(Shrink).fvwm Version 2.5.8-2( rpm package).I attached my .fvwm2rc( really simple ) with this letter .
I have been really bothered by this for months.If anyone can help I would be very appreciated.

Hiya,

I'm using fvwm and I'm trying to bind a mouse + a modifier button to
a title bar button action...

But it doesn't work and I don't know why...

Here is my configuration file :

Mouse 1 2 C Maximize
Mouse 1 4 A Iconify
Mouse 1 1 A Close

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec gnome-settings-daemon

The Maximize action doesn't work, even If I hold Ctrl down...
If someone has an idea, tell me

If I iconify a window and then, the next window gets the focus. But then, when 
I iconify the next window (with keybindings) - non of the other opened 
windows gets automatically the focus, howto change this?

Hello:

We are offering 2 email databases which allow to contact PayPal and e-Gold customers (both sellers 
and shoppers). 
These are individuals that buy and sell items using PayPal and e-Gold payment systems. 
(Please notice that 90% of PayPal customers are also customers of eBay.) 

These databases will be perfect for selling your products/services, because we are providing you
unique prospects who purchase and sell online more than anybody else! Besides, the data provided 
contains personal email addresses of only those PayPal and e-Gold members who were active 
(purchased or sold something) in the last 2 months.

PayPal - 406,000 records
e-Gold - 372,000 records
 
The databases will be delivered to you in any format of your choice (Excel, ASCII, CSV, etc.). 
By default they are provided in 4-6MB TXT files. 
New updates will be released quarterly.

The total price we are asking for both databases is $365. To place the order please fill out the form:
http://www.gmthost.com/paypal.php

To contact me please email to service@gmthost.com (THIS EMAIL ONLY! DO NOT 'REPLY').

Please notice that we also maintain a variety of other b2b and b2c lists.

Best,
Tom Dullex

(Please write replies below the quoted message on this list)

I wanted to say that you have to replace "Icon" with "MiniIcon" in
the "Thumbnail" function in Tavis' config file.  Maybe you have to
adapt a few places where it's used too - I don't know exactly.

It's the previous icon that gets the focus.  With

  Style * CirculateSkipIcon

icons are no longer considered to accept focus when another window
is iconified.

Do you have NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock pressed?

Yes I had Numlock pressed and the action didn't work.
I disabled Numlock and it works again :).

Howdy,

First of all, the prerequisite praise of fvwm:  I love this window manager
:)

Now, I've reached a hurdle, which is xinerama.  I've successfully set up
xfree86 to use two monitors (of different resolutions and bit-depths), and
I'm allowing fvwm to do its default behaviour, i.e.  separate instances of
fvwm on each.

But now, except that the mouse can transcend physical monitor boundaries
and that there is one clipboard for all monitors, windows are stuck on
whichever monitor they start on, and I cannot alt-tab between monitors.

I would like there to be one instance of fvwm for both physical monitors,
such that I can drag windows between monitors.  However, I would like the
two monitors to page separately.

In other words, I would like to allow the situation in which my first
monitor is on virtual desktop x, while the my second monitor is on virtual
desktop y.  I would, of course, also like to allow the situation in which
my first monitor is on virtual desktop x, and my second monitor is on
virtual desktop x (while the two monitors still show a disjoint part of 
virtual desktop x).

Is this possible?  If so how?  Multiple copies of fvwmpager?

Thanks,

Hello,


I'm having some difficulties to make fvwm (2.4.6) do what I want, so
maybe you can help ^_^


As I use it on a PC, I'd like to bind some functions on the famous
windows keys. After testing, it seems it correspond to the modifiers
#4 and #9.
Thus, after having pressed one, everything goes wrong with bindings.
For example emacs starts to make a confusion between Alt (which then
just beeps) and windows (which then acts as the meta key).

How could I do to make it work?


I also have another question about the titlebar buttons...
Is it possible to explicitly disable a button? The purpose is to have
inactive windows buttonless.


Thank you for any help (and for maintaining such a good wm).

If you need a stable version, use the latest 2.4.x release.  None
of the 2.5.x releases can be called stable.

Hi,

I extended the very nice Module fvwm-menu-headlines with some german Newspa=
ges=20
like http://www.pro-linux.de .=20
The problem is that some of the German headlines get coruppted because of t=
he=20
'Umlaute' like =F6=E4=FC=DF and so on.
When any of these 'Umlaute' where present, no more text is displayed.

It's a problem of the fvwm-menu in general. It can't display Umlaute.

Is there any soultion?

regards

and in what time frame, very approximately, is a stable release
(version 2.6.x I guess) of 2.5 to be expected ?
  ... or is it intended only for hackers, but not for normal users ?

Actually, you are *not* running Xinerama.  The whole point of
Xinerama is to treat all video screens as a single big screen.
Applications do not even notice different screens.  Multiple fvwms
can not run on a single Xinerama root window, so you must have a
conventional multi-head X setup.

You have to check your X setup and change it so that is uses
Xinerama.

There is no modifier "#9" in X.  There are only the modifiers
shift, lock, control, and 1 to 5.

Probably one of the modifiers is locking, which changes the whole
keyboard layout.

> How could I do to make it work?

First, check the output of

  $ xmodmap -pke; xmodmap

None of the modifier keys should appear twice in either list.
Double check that the the target key appears in the modifier list.
if not, add it at the end of your $HOME/.Xmodmap file.  If you do
not have such a file yet, generate it with

  $ xmodmap -pk > "$HOME"/.Xmodmap

Then check the modifiers at the end of the file.  For example, I
have

  clear Shift
  clear Lock
  clear Control
  clear Mod1
  clear Mod2
  clear Mod3
  clear Mod4
  clear Mod5

  add    Shift   = Shift_L Shift_R
  !add    Lock    = Caps_Lock
  add    Control = Control_L Control_R
  !add    Control = Control_L Multi_key
  add    Mod1    = Meta_L
  !add    Mod2    = Num_Lock
  add    Mod3    = Mode_switch
  add    Mod4    = Super_L Super_R
  add    Mod5    = Hyper_R

  Style <windowname> NoButton 7

but that does not differentiate between active and inactive
windows.

I'm sorry, but nobody can make a sensible statement about it at
the moment.  Definitely not within the next three month.

hi,

A friend of mine recently showed me about the ALT + page-up or
page-down capability to raise or lower the volume by accessing aumix
in WindowMaker.  I'm now trying to implement this on my own system,
but can't figure out the keybindings for it in fvwm.  I've seen this
post:

    http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0306/msg00444.html

but (a) I'm not sure what exactly those keybindings do (what's A?
what's N? where are they documented?), and (b) they don't seem to do
what I want.

Anyone got any keybinding for the fvwmrc for this?

Thanks,

</nori>

Start by getting the correct key name for page-up and page-down. Look in

/usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h

Use the name but remove the XK_ prefix (in your fvwm2rc)

I'm no hacker and I use fvwm 2.5.8(cvs) on my work PC, where I can't
afford hours of downtime to mess with my wm (my boss will get agitated
:). I don't have any problems with it, and the transparency support
makes it a must IMHO.

My point was not adressed to you personnally
It is just that 2.5 has been in the works quite a long time, and
there is no end in sight.
  Since it is considered unstable, it is not packaged for many
distrib, including the one I use (Mandrake).  Though someone gave me
some brief instructions, it was not precise enough for me to follow.

I just cannot afford the time to guess how I am supposed to compile
things, with the right environment.  I do other things to contribute
to free software, and any time I spend on this is essentially wasted
(since it is of use only to myself).  I understand that real men use
only Debian ... well I am not one of them.

great.  i found these by a more careful reading of the manpage, but
they're buried in there!  i've been skimming that manpages every now
and then for months, and never found them :-P

awesome; thanks!  now i understand the whole keybindings better, and
have a better idea of where to refer to in the manpage.  i love fvwm,
but i wish the explanation for this were displayed somewhere more
prominent.

thanks agian!

I've been using the 2.5 series for nearly 2 years now.. and have probably had
a handful of crashes so far.

Does Mandrake still ship fvwm ?

Whats wrong with these binary rpms here ?

http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=fvwm

Have you even bothered to try 

rpmbuild -ta fvwm-2.5.10.tar.gz

Or alternately you can hire the services of a consultant to package and
install fvwm on your machine!

>  I understand that real men use only Debian ... well I am not one of them.

And what does have to do with anything ?

no  ... I do not know why

All those intended for Mandrake seem to be version 1.24

I have not tried these ...  aren't they old versions

> Have you even bothered to try 
>

no because no one suggested it to me, and I have never done it.

Now, will that build a package that runs with Mandrake, if done in my
Mandrake environment ?
  I will try to see a real manual ... man does not say much ...

The reason for my question is that I did download
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fvwm-themes/fvwm-2.5.8-2.i386.rpm
intended for Red-Hat, that I found on the FVWM site at <URL:
http://www.fvwm.org/>.

  but it did not work (not that I expected very much)

> Or alternately you can hire the services of a consultant to package and

the whole point is that one should not need that.  So there may be
a pointer to some simple doc missing somewhere.

good question, and sorry about this display (no pun intended).  Well I
found packages for Debian and Red-Hat but that is all.
  I guess it was just an uncalled for reaction, because too many
people, though not here, consider that one should be a hacker to
deserve free software.  And it does make my life difficult, not so
much for myself, but when I try to promote free software.

  Fvwm happens to be my preferred WM, and has been for many years.
But I do not have much time to spend on configuring my linux box.

Thanks for replying

Bernard

I just created a menu item with these 4 chars surrounded by other

What is the font you define in MenuStyle * Font? What is your locale?

It was -dosemu-*-*-*-*-17-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-* which can't display Umlaute.
So I changed it to -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-=
15
and all Umlaute where displayed :-) -> Thanks!

Does any body knows other great looking fonts?

Is it possible to include TrueTypeFonts ? I use the latest devel-version of=

On the second thought, people who need this, may probably just place your
extension.pl into ~/.fvwm/.fvwm-menu-headlines/.

I have no time to test it, but after looking at it I see it may be highly

Take a look at font names (including xtf) used in configs posted on
fvwm.org, or in fvwm-themes.

yes it should build one.

Ditto with the ones on rpmfind.. just get the source rpm and compile for your

This is a bad advice, the good advice is to follow the instructions in:

Why is that bad advice?

It would be useful to have a link to that from the FAQ, although I think
it's overly complicated. These 3 simple steps work for me:

1) Create a ~/.rpmmacros file thus:
	
%_topdir /home/user/redhat

(that's taken from the page you referenced )

2) download the tarball and put it in /tmp

3) run e.g. rpmbuild -tb /tmp/fvwm-2.5.10.tar.gz

fvwm already provides a .spec file in the tarball, so IMO it makes
sense to use the facilities rpm provides rather than unpack the
tarball and run configure and make.

Chris

Try to fetch us a stack trace.  Find the core file and run

  $ gdb FvwmTaskBar core
  (gdb) where

(you need to compile fvwm with the -g option, which is the
default).  If there is no core file, look for error messages on
the console.

not competent (yet ?) on what is good or bad advice ...  but ...

this is in the developer section of the site ... which of course I
would not even look at, not being a developer.  Actually, it is not
even visible at the top of the home page ... though it is in the
quick-jumps list of the home page.

  If this information is usable by anyone, maybe it should be
referenced from the download page http://fvwm.org/download/

for people who do not find an appropriate version.

Just a suggestion.

I'm trying to install on Solaris 8.  I get the following when running a
make.

"make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 333: Badly formed macro
assignment
Current working directory /var/tmp/fvwm-2.5.10/debian
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install-recursive'

Any ideas?

If you are trying to install from CVS you will need gnumake.
If you are getting these errors from a tar.gz then there is a
problem with the tar.gz.

Hi,all
I sometimes click the close button and suddenly find that I do not really want to close this window.Not loosing the mouse,I move the cursor elsewhere,then loose it.Still,the window closed.
Since my last question seems really foolish,I hope this one not.But If did ,forgive me,please.

The Makefile in the debian directory is broken.
You can avoid it by changing the Makefile in the top directory.
Remove debian from the list assigned to SUBDIR.


At least these 2 lines in debian/Makefile.am are gnumake only:

arch ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_ARCH)
fullinstdir ?= $(shell cd $(top_srcdir) && pwd)/$(instdir)

I think rpmbuild does not create this directory and its subdirs, so this
should be done once too.

If one uses cvs to update releases or snapshots, then he doesn't need
this download step.

> 3) run e.g. rpmbuild -tb /tmp/fvwm-2.5.10.tar.gz

Then you get fvwm-2.5.10-1 rpm and you have no chance to change the
release string, the configure params and the make params.

The provided spec file is ok and may be used as a template. However it is
patched by "make rpm-dist" procedure that is the suggested/universal way.
I kind of like that users get the release string "0.current-date" by
default, and not "1" that usually means final/official rpm release.

Mikhael.

You may solve this by creating this safety feel (taken from fvwm-themes):

  DestroyFunc DeleteOrDestroy
  AddToFunc   DeleteOrDestroy
  + H Nop
  + M Nop
  + C Delete
  + D Destroy

Then clicking or double clicking close the window. Just holding the mouse
button (with or without moving) does nothing.

I think the "Developement Info" is not included in the default web pager
intentionally, but I may mistake.

This information is not intended for regular users, but for advanced
users with experience in building fvwm from a snapshot/cvs and packaging
rpms. But you are right, it is not quite limited to developers.

tried 2, 3 times, worked fine when it failed everytime before.
it looks like a race condition. my machine is heavily loaded,

|What does the $FVWM_USERDIR/.fvwmtabs.state file look like after

looks good :

createNewTabber();
$fvwm->send("Move 0p 0p", $tabWin{0}{selfId});
$fvwm->send("MoveToDesk 0 0", $tabWin{0}{selfId});
addTab(0, 67108880);
addTab(0, 75497488);
showTab(0, 0);


but it's not a real test with 4x4 terms.

i think Ctrl-Alt-K & then Ctrl-Alt-S in the key.

thanks for your help

That's what I remember having read in the man, thus I tried up to #10

Thanks for all your explanations. The problem it still unsolved, but
as it's definatly not related to fvwm, I'll try to find out by myself.

The idea was that an inactive window doesn't need buttons, since when
you want to use one, the window becomes active.

May such a behavior be available in a future release?

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:
bugfix: calculation of when to wrap the title text was flaky - caused windows
        with long titles to grow horizontally.
bugfix: stop iconified tabbers being deiconified during restarts.
bBuggyFocus option for systems that have difficulty focusing tab-managers.

SCoTT. :)

It would be nice to have something for regular users, every now and
then ...   version 2.5 has been in the works for years ...
  We know we are taking chances with an unstable version, but at the
same time everyone says it is not that unstable.
  But taking chances and having to learn too much is not the same thing.

Anyway, thanks to all ... I'll try.

Bernard

Hi,

Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this
question, please redirect me to the appropriate palce.

My question is how do I use the "FvwmTaskbar MailBox"
setting when I use IMAP for my mail access. All fvwm
says is add the path. Can someone help me out with how
the path has to be specified. {imap.domain.com}INBOX
does not work.

Thanks

Uday

This my point exactily there is no use it using 2.4 doesn't have enought 
features yet users are encouraged to use it beacause it is "stabel." If 
there was a faster stable release cycle that would solve the problem.

Yes, sure.  Everybody is welcome to help in getting the 2.6
release out the door.  Please remember that we are all volunteers

we do realize that, and I personally feel awkward when I ask.

  The idea is that maybe a little gentle pressure from friends (we
would not even bother if we were not friends) may help draw a line and
get a version out.

  I am blind on the current state of FVWM.  But if, as many seem to
think, there is much more functionality in 2.5.10 than in 2.4, it could
be a good idea to decide to have something out as stable version.
Especially since there are comments that it is fairly reliable.

  Or are there reasons I cannot guess not to do it ?  maybe 2.5
functionnality is behind that of 2.4 in some areas ?  Sorry to be naive
on these issues.

with all due respect to your work

Hi

I've created a nice white colored bar using FvwmButtons, so I thought a
black shadow would look nice on it. How would I accomplish this? I've
tried:

Colorset 2 Foreground black, Background white, Shadow black
*FvwmButtons: Colorset 2

But that doesn't seem to create a shadow on it?

I am using 2.5.8 as backport for Debian/WOODY and it works quiet well ;-)

Anyone can use 2.5.x.

If you send mail to this list and ask for a stable release
you will be referred to a 2.4.x release since that is the stable
branch.

Probably some of the 2.5.x releases are more stable than other 2.5.x
releases, but I don't think anyone knows which ones are more stable and
which ones aren't.  When a 2.5.x release is created it's almost always done
with a source tree that we think works well.

In my opinion, the only 2.5.x release that it makes sense to use is
the latest one.

> I am using 2.5.8 as backport for Debian/WOODY and it works quiet well ;-)

All thru the 2.5.x release I've run from CVS and I've had very
few problems.  I don't think that makes it stable through.

Works for me as expected. What is your full FvwmButtons configuration?
Do you mean "Hilight black" in the colorset defenition too?

Hello everybody.

I've made some changes to FvwmIconMan code which allow you to show only
the window which has focus. I use this to make my desktop to look like a Mac
(or Gnome :-) with an icon of the active application in upper right corner.
So I think it is a nice feature and would like to share. Where should I
put/post/upload my changes?

Hi everyone,

If anyone like me, likes the Mac OSX look, now it's possible to
compliment your desktop with a nice transparent and totally customizable
Dock Mac OSX look-alike.

Here is a snapshot:

And here is the code:

Special thanks to Tavis O. for making this possible.

I don't see any difference if I add that either. There is a screenshot
at http://johan.svedberg.pp.se/files/tmp/FvwmButtons.png. Strange, I
must be doing something wrong. Here is the full relavent configuration:

*FvwmButtons: Columns 4
*FvwmButtons: Font None

Hi all,

does anyone have a solution for this one:

I use FvwmTaskbar (and no icons). If I have let's say two windows open
and minimize the active one then the other stays deactivated. Could I
have it activated automatically somehow? And, if there are more than
two, the window which was last activated should be activated then.

Felix

With "Frame 0" there is no 3d relief, so your shadow/hilight colors are
applied to nothing.

Accourding to your screenshot, you may want, instead, to swallow something
(probably another FvwmButtons) and define relief of that swallowed thing.

Mikhael.

Have this function:

  DestroyFunc FlipIconify
  AddToFunc   FlipIconify
  + I Iconify on
  + I Prev Iconify off

and use it instead of "Iconify on". Of course you may need to tweak some
things like parameters of Prev or adding TestRc conditions. Since you
didn't define the result of all possible window combination, it is hard
to guess the desired behaviour. Hopefully you may complete this yourself.

Mikhael.

Create documentation for the new option (including man page and ChangeLog
sections), and post the "cvs diff -u" patch to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

I think you mean dialog instead of voices, but I do not know the answers
to your questions.
I use a very old and horribly written fvwm95 configuration file that may
provide somewhere to start looking.  You can find a screenshot and the
.fvwm2rc file on the fvwm.org screenshot page.
I think the FvwmTaskBar section might be what you were looking for?
Either that, or the AddToMenu parts...

The file is a hidden file with a . in front of it.
find / -name .fvwm2rc -print
will search your whole system for this file.
On my system, it is in ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
If you do not have it, try searching for a system.fvwm2rc file the same
way.
I hope this helps.
I'm only answering because I saw nobody else had and thought I might offer
a place to start.
I'm sure the veteran staff will correct my bad advice soon.

       *FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon icon-name
              This option specifies the name of the icon to  dis=AD
              play at the left of the Start button.

See above.

"menu voices" -> "menu entries"

       *FvwmTaskBar: Font font
              Specifies  the default font to be used for labeling
              the buttons, when they are not  depressed.  If  not
              specified, fixed font is assumed.


       *FvwmTaskBar: SelFont font
              Specifies  the  font  to  be used for the depressed
              buttons. Note that the Start button will use always
              this font even if is not pressed. If this option is
              not specified, the default font is used instead.


       *FvwmTaskBar: StatusFont font
              Specifies the font to be used for the clock and tip
              windows.  If  this  option  is not specified, fixed
              font is used.

If you use fvwm-themes, then there is no fvwm2rc file. You should read
the documentation explaining how to use and change themes, available on
the fvwm-themes web site (that in turn is available from your root menu).

If you want to change the redmondxp (or redmond98?) theme, then make a
copy of the directory like /usr/local/share/fvwm/themes/redmondxp to
redmondxp2 and edit the copied files.

Another way to customize things in fvwm-themes is to create corresponding
files in your personal theme (create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/ dir first).
For example, you may define your own Style Icon and MiniIcon lines in
file "styles-extra" (or better yet "iconstyles-extra") in this directory,
and then follow the procedure described in the fvwm-themes FAQ.

There is no GUI in fvwm-themes to create this iconstyles-extra file, if
this is what you want. But you may write such GUI, it is not very hard.

Mikhael.

i want to know which configuration files should i edit to make the fvwm
redmondxp theme more windows xp style. because i can't edit the file call=
ed
.fvwm2rc like here : http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/configs/fvwm2rc,becaus=
e
they use no theme. we have different configuration files. maybe to make
the things easier i shouldn't use themes,but i like the fvwm windows xp
themed task bar, i won't to lose it. my problem is that i want to find a
tool/project/script to make the icons on the desktop like windows xp,but
im not able to find something useful for me. i've found only the perl scr=
ipt
in the website above,but is very hard to understand how make it works. ti=
ll
now i've found :

1) rox filer with pinboard,but i dislike the filer
2) idesk,but there is no wizard to make the icons on the desktop,i should=

edit the configuration file by hand
3) desktop file manager,with a very bad wizard to make icons on desktop

i have no other solutions till now...

> 1) how is called the image file of the startup button ? where is it

       *FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon icon-name
              This option specifies the name of the icon to  dis=AD
              play at the left of the Start button.

> about

See above.

> 
> 3) how can I change the fonts of the menu voices?

"menu voices" -> "menu entries"

       *FvwmTaskBar: Font font
              Specifies  the default font to be used for labeling
              the buttons, when they are not  depressed.  If  not
              specified, fixed font is assumed.


       *FvwmTaskBar: SelFont font
              Specifies  the  font  to  be used for the depressed
              buttons. Note that the Start button will use always
              this font even if is not pressed. If this option is
              not specified, the default font is used instead.


       *FvwmTaskBar: StatusFont font
              Specifies the font to be used for the clock and tip
              windows.  If  this  option  is not specified, fixed
              font is used.

the files that i should edit are the same that u explain above,now that
u know that im using the redmondxp theme ?

lemme know,thanks

There are fvwm-themes mailing lists for fvwm-themes specific questions.

Since I never tried this script, I can't say anything concrete about it.
I think, in order to work it requires its own setup and environment that
are unlikely to be compatible with fvwm-themes.

In the quote above I mentioned the location of all RedmondXP theme files.
The theme does not use FvwmTaskBar module, but FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan.

After googling around I have found about your plans:

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=366811

It may help to be expert in both fvwm and unix to complete such WinDE
project. Good luck. BTW, did you see www.xpde.com?

Mikhael.

Hi

I want to set an exclude zone for the maximize command:
If i have a 1024x768 screen when i maximize a window i want it 
to be maximized only at 768x768 for example. How do i do this with 
fvwm 2.4 ?
Example 

------------------------------|
                              |
                              |
                       |------|
                       |      |
                       |pager |
                       |      |
                       |------|
                              |
                              |
                              |
------------------------------|

I don't want that maximized window to obscure the pager.
How can i do this ?

Thanks

Bye
Calin

I changed to 2.5 to realize this. I think in 2.4 it's not possible.=20

2.5 is a developer release, but it's stable enough for daily work - I havn'=

In kde and gnome there is a dynamic menu created for each app used or
file opened.  

I would like to create a dynamic menu like this in fvwm that parses both
kde and gnome (currently I think kde only keeps track of its apps and
gnome pays attention to its apps)

Is this possible to achieve?

Hello,

I have a number of questions concerning WindowList command:


1) Is there is a way to define more than one key in SelectOnRelease
(for example, I want to define both Meta_L and Meta_R with that
option (or, better still, Control_L & Control_R, though it seems that
it is impossible to use Ctrl for WindowList - combination of
Ctrl+Tab doesn't move the hilight)).

2) Is it possible to remove desk info and separator from the
WindowList (i.e. the title: "Desk: 0" in my case, for example)

3) What the UseListSkip/OnlyUseListSkip option used for?

4) Is it somehow possible to display icons (i.e., small pixmaps)
in the WindowList the way it is possible in a regular menu?

5) Is it possible to prevent mouse movement from interfering with
hilighting/selection? For example: I use keyboard shortcut to
bring up WindowList and hilight item 4 by moving hilight from item 0
to item 4 using arrow keys - if after that i move a pointer (by means
of mouse) so that it points at other item - the hilight changes to the
item now pointed at.

I want to be able to do one of the following (or, better still, either
of the following :) )

	a) disable mouse movement at all, so that while WindowList is
	active it is impossible to move mouse pointer by moving a mouse.

	b) decouple WindowList and mouse pointer, so that bringing up
	WindowList and moving hilight by keyboard won't move a pointer,
	and moving a pointer (even over WindowList) won't change hilight
	(and clicking on item won't select it).

Is that possible?

Hi all,

What's the best way to effectively accomplish this in my .fvwm2rc file?

if xdpyinfo | /bin/grep -q XINERAMA ; then
	Xinerama on
	XineramaPrimaryScreen 0
	Style * StartsOnScreen c
	DeskTopSize 4x1
else
	DeskTopSize 6x1
fi

SCoTT. :)

Hello,

I sent you an email in early April and haven't received a response yet. Below I have copied my original email. I am still interested in trading links with your site.  Please let me know if you are interested or not.

Thanks again, 
-Alan S. Byerly

---------------------------------------------

Hello,

I am the Non-Profit Coordinator of the Vitamins and Nutrition Center located at http://www.vitamins-nutrition.org/. We have been looking for partners to exchange links with. I have taken a look at your site and it seems like it would be a resource that people searching for Health or Vitamins might also be interested in visiting, as we have hundreds of articles that relate to everything about vitamins, health, and well-being.

I propose that we exchange links. If you will link to the "Vitamins and Nutrition Center" at http://www.vitamins-nutrition.org/ (our website) and send me a quick email letting me know where the link can be found on your site, I will add a reciprocal link to our site within 48 hours. If you would like to include a short byline for your site, please also include that with your email. You would get free traffic to your site and we would get a database of quality sites to offer our viewers.

If you would like, but certainly a simple link alone will do, a sample byline for our site would be:

The Vitamins and Nutrition Center provides accurate information on vitamins and nutrition, research on vitamins and the different effects of vitamin deficiency.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience where your link is located so we can add you to our links page as soon as possible. 

Warm regards,

Alan S. Byerly, Coordinator 
The Vitamins and Nutrition Center
http://www.vitamins-nutrition.org/ 
alan@vitamins-nutrition.org

P.S. If this was not the correct person to send this request to, please accept my sincerest apologies. If you could forward this on to the correct person, I would be most appreciative.

Not sure about the best way, fvwm seems to always have new ways but
PipeRead would do this.

I searched their mailing list and came up empty.
Do you have any hints?

When I use windows list to change windows using alt-tab:
Key Tab		A	M	WindowList (CurrentDesk) Root c c NoDeskSort, CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd, ShowPageX
The pointer is moved to the top-left corner of the new window. How can
I make it stay at the same location? Its quite annoying having to move
it back to its place every time. This also causes focus problems with
border-less windows and sloppy focus. If I have to move the pointer, a
better behavior would be to move the pointer to the center of the new
window, this would also solve the focus problems I had with sloppy
focus and focusing a window that is not under the mouse when the mouse
is over a different window.

Hello-
By a mistake I now have fvwm2 on my SUSE9x linux 
machine.
If it is important I will another time explain how 
the accident happened.
However I like the manager and want to keep it.

At the first start up I got to choose number of 
virtual windows and not knowing what was what I 
ended up with 6 [2x3].

I would now like more and started to read the 
website manual pages.  It tells of DeskTopSize hxv
I assume that if I type this command into a 
terminal that all will be well but nothing happens 
so obviously either I am misunderstanding it or 
maybe one can only use this command as root?

That isn't what the manual implies.

Could you clear this up?
Thanks.

Fvwm commands can be entered in many ways.
For your setup, look for a file named:

~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

To center them mouse, among other things, (after a selection from WindowList),
i use...

  DestroyFunc  WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc    WindowListFunc
  +  I Function deiconify-func Raise
  +  I FlipFocus
  +  I WarpToWindow 50 50

  DestroyFunc  deiconify-func
  AddToFunc    deiconify-func
  +  I Iconify false
  +  I WindowShade false
  +  I $0

...the big idea is to (re)define WindowListFunc ... eh ... function
which is used by WindowList.  See fvwm(1) for default & other
data.

I have got an application which acts as if it is able to somehow
ignore the window manager.

* Its windows are always on top of everything else, and are
  effectively sticky (in that they are always present, even
  if I move to a different page).

* When I move the mouse into one of them (so that it gets focus,
  and its border highlights) the border of the previously-focused
  normal window remains highlighted even though keystrokes are
  going to the usurper.

* If I run FvwmIdent and click in one of this application's windows,
  FvwmIdent exits without producing its usual window, as if I had
  clicked on the root window.

* Their decorations are a bit different.  Their frames appear to
  be a pixel or two wider, and they have fewer buttons.  Also, the
  leftmost button's menu provides different options.

Is there any way to make such an application behave itself, without
hacking on the application itself?  I think it was originally a
Windoze application, ported to Solaris with MainWin, however I've
used other MainWin apps which did not behave this way so don't know
if that is a factor.  DISPLAY is a Red Hat 9 system, with:

Hi all,

I've figured out most of what's wrong with my .fvwm2rc and various other 
manager config files.  Most of it was assuming that my older .fvwm2rc 
wouldn't cause things to break, but it did.  2.5.9 fvwm chokes on some of the 
2.4.x options.

Anyway, I'm running version 2.5.9 compiled for AMD64 under Mandrake 9.2 for 
AMD64 and am having a problem with the fvwm Icon Manager.  Specifically, the 
little square to the left of the button label that indicates whether or not a 
window is iconfied or not.  This square is usually absent.  The only time 
this square is present is if I resetart fvwm while a window is iconified.  
The square is present on restart on the iconified window, and will stay there 
until I de-iconify the window.  Upon iconifying the window again, the square 
is no longer present.

I haven't upgraded to 2.5.10 yet.  Will this fix the problem or is there 
something else funny going on?  I didn't see any option in the FvwmIconMan 
man page to indicate the little square is even an option that can be 
disabled.

Thanks in advance.

Howdy,

I am trying to define a function, called Close_fcn, which is bound to the 
close button on my title bars.  I would like this function to, in addition 
to closing the window, automatically focus another window which may or may 
not be on the same desk.  What I have so far is:

#------------------
DestroyFunc Close_fcn
AddToFunc Close_fcn
+ "I" Close
+ "I" Next (!Sticky) Focus

Mouse 1 7 A             Close_fcn
#------------------

However, I would like to impose an ordering on these windows: I would like 
it to (1) focus a window on the same desk if available, and (2) focus any 
other window if [1] fails.

So, is this possible?  I use fvwm 2.4.16

Also,

Is it possibly for me to bind a function to the event that a window is 
closed (not necessarily explicitly)?  The example of this situation that 
comes to mind is xpdf, which has a big 'quit' button.  Can I bind a 
function to be called when this 'quit' button causes the window to close, 
just as if the close button on the titlebar were pushed?

Thanks,

Sorry, no screenshot but that's not a problem, problem is that I have
nowhere to upload it and I'm afraid to post it to list

Hi,

I am totally new  at FVWM. In fact I have discovered it  2 or 3 days ago
but I am yet, having fun with it.

It seems so powerful that I plan to use it instead of my other WMs.

For instance  I used to use  Ion which is another  approach to windowing
management.

I already have had a few  discussions about FVWM with a couple of people
on  DLFP (Da Linux  French Page)  site [1]  and few  have shown  me some
amaizing screenshots. 

I also played  with configurations from Taviso, Ikaro...  and wow ! This
is amazing stuff !

So  I  registered yesterday  the  domain  name  FVWMFR.ORG and  plan  to
install  tikiwiki on it  so that  french people  can share  their hints,
tips, excerpt of configuration files, screenshots, announces...

Feel free to visit it. I plan to finish to install it on Sunday evening.

Aim at  this is for  me to learn  more on this fabulous  Window Manager,
share  my knowledge  (yeah I  know it  is poor  at the  moment), discuss
about FVWM2 features,...

I hope  I would be able to  federate many french (or  not) people around
this topic.

Thank you

I met some trouble to use Qt applications because of the font size.
Qt doesn't use .Xdefaults as common X application. 
To avoid to give font at the launch of the application with option
-fn "font definition" modify in the ~/.qt/qtrc file which looks like :

[General]
...
...
font=name_font,nb,...whatever the default proposition for the rest.
...

With 'name_font' : lucida, clean and so on what you can get with 
                   the parameter proposed by /usr/X11R6/bin/xfontsel
                   (-fmly-)
'nb' : seem to be the rank into the list of sizes proposed by the font
       selected, to much higher will set a default font different.

With Kde this problem are managed but not in Fvwm. Fvwm user have to
known that default setting of such program are in ~/.qt/qtrc and not
in .Xdefaults !

Yay! I don't speak french, but I am always happy to see people get excited
about open source, especially to the extent that they're willing to help
others. I applaud your attitude and I hope your site does well :-)

	You can't run two window managers at the same time under the
same X session.

It has nothing to do with the WMs.  .xinitrc and .xsession are usually sh
scripts.  Think about what exec does in sh.  Check the sh man page if
you don't know.

This script will only ever say "hello":

--->
#!/bin/sh
exec echo "hello"
exec echo "goodbye"
