Hello here :)

Too long time since I posted my last (bug?) report. I am using fvwm 2.3.16
on SUN sparc workstation running openwindows. I also run Netscape
Communicator 4.7. I noticed some strange behaviour of FvwmPager with it. By
the way, I use point-to-focus model.

When I have mouse in netscape window I see it focused on the pager (on the
icon man too as far as I tested). The I press the right (third) mouse
button to call netscape menu, the menu appears and with it netscape window
is shown unfocused on the pager (and iconman). Then I release the button,
the menu disappears and netscape window receives the keyboard focus back, I
see netscape react to keypresses but it is shown unfocused on pager (and
iconman). No window has focus according to the pager (and iconman).

I think this is a bug though a minor one. If I do something wrong, tell me
please.

Hope it helps.

Hi... Im running FVWM 2.2.4 on a RedHat 6.1 system and every so often
(read: unreproduceable but regularly) the window manager stops responding.

the symptoms are: key-bindings stop working, and I am unable to invoke the
WINDOW-OPTIONS pop-up by clicking on the upper-left portion of any of the 
window decorations. My right and left mouse-click behaviors still work,
though.

the only way I have found to restore window management is to log out of X
(which is highly suboptimal). (The restart FVWM function doesnt do
anything)

has anyone solved this problem before?? does it even reside with FVWM ??

Thanx,

-Dan

Hi,
I recently upgraded to RH6.1 and am using fvwm2.2.4 and have never run
into the problems you mention.  Are you also using gnome?

Sorry,

The problem is solved. It was a function of the NUMLOCK modifier being
engaged.

Hi all,

I am new to the world of fvwm, so I hope there is an easy solution for this
problem that I just haven't figured out yet:  I would like to start an
application in InitFunction, and have fvwm automatically quit when that
application is exited or killed.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Rick Teudt

Hi

I'd like to know if it's possible to set a default cursor with a
provided xbm file for everything, not just the root window, i know how
to do that with xsetroot.  But I want to set one for everything, whether
I'm in Netscape, or whatever..

Thanks

I don't think there's any way to change the cursor used *within* an
application context, except by configuring/hacking the application.
For example, the little "hand" cursor in Netscape when you rollover a
link is private to Netscape. It's an area of weakness in X, IMHO.

What you probably want to do is go outside of FVWM for this. If you
start up FVWM in your .xsession (or whatever) with 

fvwm2 &

processing continues in the .xsession. Then you start up your window
with a line like this

exec logout_app -option -option 

That makes logout_app the controlling process for the X session, which 
sounds like what you want.

I disagree.  I find this stuff in my Netscape.ad file:

! Mouse cursor when over an anchor.
*linkCursor:			hand2
! Mouse cursor when awaiting a reply.
*busyCursor:			watch
! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and over a link.
*saveNextLinkCursor:		hand2
! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and not over a link.
*saveNextNonlinkCursor:		crosshair

Oops, sorry Michael, you did mention "configuring".  I guess you meant
a simple way to do this for all applications,  without hacking a bunch
of resources.

You could just find the bitmaps and change them.  For Solaris 2.6 they
seem to be in /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf.Z.

I think you could do it within fvwm2 though. Say your app was called
MyMainThing, then why not try:

	AddToFunc InvokeMyMainThing
	+ "I" PipeRead MyMainThing
	+ "I" Quit

	AddToFunc InitFunction
	+ "I" InvokeMyMainThing

I *guess* this will work...

Hi,

have it and where
can I find i? I also would like to know how to change the window
resolution in such a way
that all X application show small?

thanks

Looking back at your previous question, I see that my last answer
assumed you got past this step.  Sorry about that.

The file "INSTALL.fvwm"  in the fvwm   distribution explains what  you
need.  You need to  get  and install the  XPM  library, and then  tell
configure where it is.

Your previous mails indicate that you are running Solaris 2.6 on an
UltraSparc.  Usually Solaris picks the highest resolution.

What Window resolution do you have?  For example, I get:

fork> xdpyinfo | grep dimen
  dimensions:    1280x1024 pixels (361x289 millimeters)

You can make individual windows smaller by using smaller fonts.
For example:

xterm -fn 6x13bold

I finally got around to read your mail more carefully and to look
into the problem.  It's not a problem of active icons but of xterm
icons in general.  I tried it with 2.0.38 (the oldest version I have
handy right now), 2.0.46 (the last 2.0.x release) and the latest
debvelopment stuff.  xterm icons don't accept input with either
version while rxvt does with all of them.  rxvt and xterm have
identical keyboard focus behaviour, so it can only be a problem of
xterm.  Perhaps this was broken in xterm some time in the past.

Bye

You can do it with FvwmEvent:

  *FvwmEvent destroy_window NoWindowsQuit
  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + i FvwmEvent
  AddToFunc RestartFunction
  + i FvwmEvent
  AddToFunc NoWindowsQuit
  + i none quit

What application are you talking about?  As Dan already said,
most applications have their own scrollbars, but perhaps we
can help you if we know the specific application that causes
you grief.

Hello,

I'm running fvwm version 2.3.16...

I would like ask two things about fvwm quoting rules. I would also like
to point out what I think might be a bug in Fvwm's quoting rules:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)

I would like to see an example of a function that uses an Fvwm parameter
consisting of a '$' followed  by a word enclosed in braces (${...}) as
mentioned in the fvwm2 the man page. I ask because the man page gives no
example of this kind of parameter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)

Also, there is a bug in the fvwm man page in the parameter section:
the following sentence is unclear to me:

To quote a beginning
       with '*') are not subject  to  parameter  expansion.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)

The string '$$2' should be expanded to '$2' but Fvwm seems to first expand
it to '$2' and then to the actual value of the function parameter $2
making it impossible to produce a literal '$2'.

For example:

AddToFunc MyFunc "I" Exec echo 111 222 333 | /bin/awk { print $$2 }' >
myfile

should execute:

echo 111 222 333 | /bin/awk { print $2 }' > myfile

Thus I should get

$ cat myfile
222

but I get

$ cat myfile
111 222 333

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil

I'm not familiar with that dist. of linux, but if you have GNU tar
installed, it also understands how to unzip a file.  So you can either do 

tar xzf fvwm2.2.4.tar.gz

or 

gunzip fvwm2.2.4.tar.gz

tar xf fvwm2.2.4.tar

and it's unpacked.  Then just build and install and you're on your way.

I've tried about a dozen permutations of simple pipe reads and failed miserably.

Why doesn't the combo:

AddToFunc ReadMove              "I" Piperead '`echo Move 10 10`'
# Button 1 with a window button modifier in an app does script
Mouse 1         W       4       ReadMove


Move the window I click in ??

I tried, echo Move 10 10, `echo Move 10 10`, and about 10 other dumb little shell things.

Fvwm Version 2.0.46


Thanks,

Keith

Hi there.

I am having some trouble running the configure script;

Some of the output is;
checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm... yes
checking for X11/xpm.h... yes
checking for Xpm 3.4f or better... no

Now, I used "--with-xpm-library=/pack/xpm/lib" and 
"--with-xpm-includes=/pack/xpm/include"
as parameters to configure and the version installed there is 3.4k (In
xpm.h it calculates the Version to 30411)

Any ideas?

Simple.  PipeRead was invented after version 2.0.46.

Please use a 2.2.x version or later.

This is a guess:

You have another version of the xpm libraries installed that configure
sees first.

If thats not it, supply more info about your OS, etc.

Well, there is a 3.4g installed, I think... It was installed before my
time - it says xpm-4.7?? But there is no way configure can see it - the
libraries are not in any paths. And anyway, the xpm.h for that version
says 30407.

I'm trying this on a sparc Solaris 2.6 machine.
Do I need to have any environments set? ie. LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LDFLAGS
etc.?

Yes, you might.  Read the instructions in INSTALL.fvwm
regarding the xpm library.

Hi there.

I got past the configure script, and I've compiled just fine.

Then I wanted to try it with ./configure --enable-extras
The configure script ran fine, but when I try to compile, I get this;
make[3]: Entering directory
`/user/eliasen/junta/download/fvwm-2.2.4/extras/FvwmConfig'

c++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../../libs -I/pack/xpm/include
-I/usr/openwin/include    -g -O2 -c FvwmConfig.C

In file included from WinBase.h:5,
                 from FvwmConfig.C:9:
/usr/openwin/include/X11/Xlib.h:2063: ANSI C++ forbids declaration
`XSetTransientForHint' with no type

I get a whole lot of those, and then it quits with this line;

make[3]: *** [FvwmConfig.o] Error 1

Help?

It's still a sparc Solaris 2.6 machine.

I think the advice we normally give is don't use '--enable-extras'.

Hello,

I cannot see that Piperead would be any more useful than Exec.
Could anyone give me an example of a useful Piperead command
that cannot be implemented as an Exec command?

Thanks,

FVWM listens for commands on the stdout of the PipeRead command. So
you can use powerful scripting tools like perl or python to do
intelligent things with PipeRead. With Exec, you're fundamentally
limited to what FVWM knows how to do (FVWM doesn't internally support
iterative constructs, conditional clauses, etc.). You'd never be able
to implement something like fvwm-menu-directory without PipeRead.

PipeRead and Exec are totally different commands, although they both start
shell commands. Exec is non-blocking, i.e. fvwm continues to run following
commands immideately without worrying about launched applications, it is
ideal for launching X applications. Contrary, PipeRead is blocking, i.e.
it waits until its shell command is finished *and* in addition executes
its standard output, as if it is fvwm native commands.

Examples (the second is for 2.3 versions, see fvwm-menu-xlock man page):

  PipeRead `echo "All ($USER@$HOST) Iconify"`
  PipeRead 'fvwm-menu-xlock --name MenuXLock --title "Lock Screen"'

Mikhael.

I suggest having your InitFunction use an Exec followed by a one line
shell script which does the following:

- starts your application
- moitors whether the application is running the Unix ps and grep and/or
  awk commands and the sleep command embedded in an infinite for loop
  (man ps; man grep; man awk; man sleep; info bash)
- then use PipeRead to extract the Fvwm Quit command which will be output
  by your script's last line echo Quit.

That should do it. What application is it you're trying to monitor and
why?

Regards,

Neil

Only by using a third party program to stretch the pixmap

That's a typo.  It should read

  ... by a word enclosed in braces ($[...]) ...
                                     ^   ^

The examples are further down in the same section:

  $[fg.cs<n>]
  $[bg.cs<n>]
  $[hilight.cs<n>]
  $[shadow.cs<n>]

The section read like this:

  To quote a '$' use "$$".  Note that module configuration lines
  (i.e. lines beginning with '*') are not subject to parameter
  expansion.

This is probably a problem with your viewer.  I often have the
problem that 'less' doesn't display certain lines in a man page.
Scrolling up a few lines and then down again solves the problem
for me.

That is because the "$$2" is axpanded *twice*.  First it's
expanded when you enter AddToFunc command (reducing it to
"$2", then it's expanded *again* when the function is executed.

To get a literal '$2' in your function you actually have to
quote the '$' twice:

  $$$$2 -> $$2 -> $2

*But* that doesn't work either at the moment.  For some
reason the stirng is expanded *three* times, which is
definitely a bug.  So at the moment you have to say

 $$$$$$$$2

:-)  Expect a fix soon.

BTW, The reason why "$$c" works, but not "$$2" is that when
fvwm encounters a parameter it can't resolve at the moment
(i.e. because the command is not executed in a window
context), it doesn't touch the parameter.

Hello,

I get the following errors in my .xsession-errors file and have no
idea of how my fvwm2 file got messed up... I think I must have pasted
something into it without knowing it or something... the worse part
is that it doesn't look much different than it did a couple of hours
ago but some things are simply not working... this is bizarre. Next
time I shall remember not to have too many windows opened at once!

[FVWM][AddWindow]: <<ERROR>> Can't get geometry
[FVWM][AddWindow]: <<ERROR>> Can't get geometry
[FVWM][AddWindow]: <<ERROR>> Can't get geometry a second time
[FVWM][AddWindow]: <<ERROR>> Can't get geometry a second time
[FVWM][AddWindow]: <<ERROR>> Can't get geometry a second time

Does anyone know what could be causing these messages. When I first
log in they are not there. The they come up.

Thanks a lot!

Neil

It's a problem with my nroff, it doesn't like something in that area.

I'll commit a fix when I figured one out. And the { -> [

Hi,

I'm using fvwm-2.2.4 on hpux. There's a problem in switching the virtual
desktops by a keyboard sequence. On suse-linux you can switch with
META-SHIFT-left / right / up / down.

My question:

Are you able to configure a keyboard-sequence to switch the desktops in
the FvwmPager in fvwmrc or is it fixed and you have to map some special
keys (with xmodmap) or something like this ;o) ??

Hope to get an answer, regards


Michael

I bind the numeric key pads to call my_resizemove so that I can tile
windows easily. The piperead script makes FvwmAnimate draw an animation
of where the window is going to. Using an Exec would mean the animation
happening some indeterminate amount of time _after_ the ResizeMove (not
cool).

I have a similar one for closing windows which animates from the window
frame down to a tiny dot, just like when you switch off an old TV.

Cheers,
Tim.

I would like to do something like define a button that would send keystrokes or ascii to the telnet session running in an xterm, is this possible?

Example:
Suppose after I telnet to a router, I click a button and "conf t\n logging console\n exit\n debug h225 asn1\n debug h245 asn1\n debug ras\n" is sent to the router via the fvwm Func I write.  

Would open up some awesome possibilities for router configuration ;-)

Thanks,


K

  I'd use telnet and expect combination for this. possibly with
combination with some gui... leaving fvwm completely out of the loop (as
I think it does not really belong there).

  to use xterm as you describe you would have to generate X keyboard
events and send them to xterm window. I am not sure how to do it using
fvwm.

Hey,

Is it possible to have sub-menus popup adjacent to the parent menu?
instead of overlaping...

Thanks!

I'm afraid I added those messages since I couldn't figure out
why an XGetGeometry call would fail for a window fvwm is trying
to add.

I guess fvwm gets notified that a window is being added, but
the window disappears before fvwm can find out about it.

I'll remove the messages.

I think you are right here. The windows I was popping up were
being unmapped so fast that I could not see the error messages
displayed within them. To see what the error messages were
I had to launch a cople dozen from my buttonbox and then chase
their titlebars: clicking on a titlebar is the only way of having
a window that's about to disappear stay on the desktop, hence
displaying the error messages I was looking for,

The following example should produce the error message:

Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /bin/sh -c "/bin/ls; \
   /bin/ls; /bin/cat nonexistentfile"

Thanks,

Neil

Yes.  The MenuStyle command allows complete control
over look and feel of menus.  Try out

  MenuStyle * mwm

to switch to mwm like menus, or

  MenuStyle * PopupOffset -3 100

To change only the placement of popup menus.  Both work
with any release from the 2.2.x series or later.  If you
still use 2.0.x or earlier, you have to use the old syntax
of the MenuStyle command (see man page) and use 'mwm'
instead of 'fvwm'.

I know it's not the right place to ask this question,
but according to my experiences I get 75% of my non-fvwm
related questions answered on this list and 0% on other
lists or newsgroups.

My problem is: since I upgraded from SuSE 6.2 to SuSE 6.4
(Linux 2.2.14, i386), all generated core files seem to be
corrupt.  Whenever I call gdb to get a stack trace all I
get is something like this:

  $ gdb <program> core
  warning: wrong size gregset struct in core file
  warning: wrong size fpregset struct in core file
  #0  0x0 in ?? ()
  (gdb) where
  #0  0x0 in ?? ()

I've already tried to recompile gdb, but to no avail.  With
my old SuSE 6.2 (kernel 2.2.10), fvwm's core dumps were
about 1.5 meg, but not they are only 300k.  I guess there
is a connection.  I can vaguely remember that there is some
way to reduce the information in a core file, but perhaps
this was on AIX.  BTW, of course I do not limit core dump
size with ulimit.

Look at man page for MenuStyle and the options of MWM, FVWM, and WIN.

To quote:

              FVWM,  MWM, WIN reset all options to the style with
              the same name in  former  versions  of  fvwm2.  The
              default  for  new  menu styles is FVWM style.
    ...
              MWM and WIN style menus popup  sub-menus  automati-
              cally.  WIN menus indicate the current menu item by
              changing the background  to  dark.  FVWM  sub-menus
              overlap  the  parent  menu, MWM and WIN style menus
              never overlap the parent menu.

Short term you can try making using gmake. Install the package from
sunfreeware (gnu make) if it's not present on your machine. Long term,
the fvwm-workers probably need to figure out what's wrong here. Being
gmake-dependant for regular builds isn't our intention.

Hello,

It would be nice if there was a generalized version of PipeRead called
PipeReadString which worked as follows: the output of

PipeReadString command.sh

would be the output of the (shell script) command. However, unlike with
PipeRead, this output would not be Exec'ed directly. Instead the output
would appear in front of an Exec command as an argument. For example:

Exec xterm -bg PipeReadString bg.sh -fg PipeReadString fg.sh

The advantage of PipeReadString over PipeRead is that of readability.
Only the parameters that do change can be the output of the shell
script rather than the whole command. That way the Fvwm script can
more easily document which parameters are subject to change and which
ones are not.

Best Regards,

Neil

Hello,

The FvwmM4 man page says:

FvwmM4 can be invoked by inserting the  line  'FvwmM4' in the
.fvwm2rc file.

I would like to see an example of how FvwmM4 can be used in this way.

Then the man page also says:

It can also be called from a menu or mouse binding.

but again provides no examples of this. Perhaps an example or
two would be useful here since I put the following in my .fvwm2rc
but it's not working right:

FvwmM4
define(`foo',`bar')

I would like to know a little bit more about the first two ways of
invoking FvwmM4 described in the man page.

Thanks,

Neil

As your second question implies, this kind of functionality is, IMHO,
better achieved using a preprocessor. Even better would be to use
FvwmTheme to define a colorset and perform a variable substitution in
an Fvwm function, as in:

AddToFunc StartXTerm I Exec xterm -bg $[bg.cs0] -fg $[fg.cs0]

All in all, it's a better way to have consistent control over colors.
I take advantage of the fact that xrdb cpp-preprocesses
.Xdefaults/.Xresources to do something similar to my resource files.
Still haven't gotten around to setting up FvwmTheme and colorsets in
my .fvwm2rc though.

Hello,

It would be handy to have an fvwm function that can be invoked through
a menu that toggles on and off all key bindings. This is useful in the
situation when one wants to test a new application but does not know
which key bindings the application makes use of / and or whether the
application's key bindings work as desired. Having to commenting out
every single keybinding from the .fvwm2rc and restarting can be tedious
at times and a menu function for toggling all key bindings on and off
would be much handier.

Thanks,

Neil

The man page is correct, i.e. fvwm 2.3.x does not expand environment
variables $VAR or ${VAR} anywhere except for 3 documented places:
ImagePath, ModulePath, Restart.

You can expand environment variables using PipeRead or FvwmM4 (`info m4`).

Fair enough - thanks for the help... I'll try wading into the xterm

Hi,

   I installed fvwm-2.2.4 and xpm packages. How can I use the xpm icons?

e.g.: when I iconifiy XTERM, I get a small barre at the top right of the
screen with
the word XTERM written on it. I would like also to use other icons for
netscape, cmdtool, ... etc.
my system is SunOS Generic_105181-17 sun4u sparc
SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIi-Engine (sol 2.6)

Where are the default icons stored? and how they are called?

Hope you can help me. And thanks for the previous answers. They were
very helpfull.

Regards

To actually see anything, try something like:

The window will then stay until you hit <Ret> in it.

OTOH, perhaps I misunderstood the whole point and you were trying something

Mm. You need to recompile gdb.

Aha. You are using a new(er) gcc/egcs version. I remember reading something about
cleverer management of symbol tables in the last release (2.95.?)

Probably you'll need an updated version of gdb... AND of binutils (perhaps
upgrading this one will suffice).

Thanks! That's certainly a very useful debugging hint!

> OTOH, perhaps I misunderstood the whole point and you were trying something

I just posted that as an example of a script that causes a window to pop
up and disappear quickly. The script I was using was actually a lot longer
so I made up something shorter. The problem I was experiencing, as it
turns out, is that some cron job on my sytem changed the permissions on
my /tmp directory making it not writeable and acusing my syntactically
correct script to crash. I had to log in as root to fix that.

Bye,

Neil

THanks for the reply, my problem was already solved offline.
Downloading the latest gdb rpm from the SuSE support site
fixed the problem.

This isn't a bug report, I'm just curious about the reason for a
particular aspect of FVWM's behavior.

Throughout 2.2 and in 2.3, the following happens:

	I move a window so that the top is not visible on the current page
	and then iconify it. When I deiconify it, the window appears
	with the top visible at the bottom of the current page.

I've always found this a bit disconserting. Whenever I install a new
version of fvwm2, I "fix" this behavior by commenting out a couple of
lines of code.  

At first, I thought that it was an obvious bug and that it would
eventually be fixed. As new versions came out, I assumed that that was the
behavior that the developers wanted.

I'm just wondering, is this a bug, a feature, or am I doing something
silly to make FVWM place deiconified windows as above? 

Cheers,

Ron

  is this related to somewhat similar situation when I drag the window
across the borders of screen so that I get to the adjacent screen and
place it there, in some cases the window does not appear on the expected
side of screen but on the other side (e.g. I enetered the screen from
right, place window there and it's suddenly on the left side). this
happens only in few case, usually when I move the mouse back to previous
screen to quickly (could it be that the screen is correctly determined
but the mouse position is the new one in the screen I switched to
immediately after placing the window)?

I've been annoyed by that one, too.  I do hope the developers don't
consider it a feature.

Does this work:

PipeRead "echo Exec xterm -bg `bg.sh` -fg `fg.sh`"

You have to install the icons in a place of your own choosing.
You can get some icons at http://www.fvwm.org.

Lets say you installed the icons in /usr/local/icons.

Add to your .fvwm2rc:

ImagePath /usr/local/icons:+
Style * Icon default.xpm
Style XTerm Icon xterm.xpm
Style cmdtool Icon toolbox.xpm

Your first suggestion:

"I" Exec xterm -fg `fg.sh` -bg `bg.sh`

does work for me. I should have thought of it.
It seems to me that with the current implementation of Exec I can follow
exec by any shell command I want so long as it does not use environment
variables.

As to your second suggestion:

PipeRead "echo Exec xterm -bg `bg.sh` -fg `fg.sh`"

This also works. For the particulr problem I posed the first solution is
a little bit cleaner but your second solution shows that PipeRead is even
more powerful than I thought eliminating the need for a generalized
version. Thanks! Keep up the good work!

Best Regards,

Neil

Why can't it use environment variables?  You may need to quote the $ to
get fvwm to ignore it, I can't remember if it will do something with $
variables or not.

Any valid shell command is OK for Exec, including ones that reference
environment variables.  But, the variables are expanded by the shell
that Exec invokes, not by FVWM before it's invoked.

PipeRead isn't any more or less powerful; it's invoking a shell.  Shells
are _very_ powerful :).  Any shell operations are valid in a PipeRead
command.  The `` is being expanded by the shell that FVWM runs, not by
the PipeRead builtin.  You probably grok that, I'm just making it clear
in case someone else is confused...

Hey!  You don't mean me do you?  (It was just meant to illustrate
the point.)

Actually I'm just posting now to check that a mail problem I was
having is cured.  (Thanks Jason.)

You can also try wm-icons package at http://wm-icons.sourceforge.net/ .
The latest version 0.2.7 should support Solaris.

Well, personally I'd say this is wrong, and doubt that anyone
disagrees. But I think this is the first time anyone's reported this.

The reason:

  When you deiconify/unmaximize windows, fvwm will put them at the
  exact location where they were when they were iconified/maximized,
  *even if this was on a different page*.  But this is not what the
  user usually wants if the window or icon is currently on the screen.
  In this case the window is moved to the same screen position, but
  on the current page.  The problem is, that if a window was - say -
  at x=-10 on page (0 0) when it was iconified and you deiconify it on
  page (1000 0), does that mean it will have x=1000*screenwidth-10
  or x=1001*screenwidth-10?  That's why windows seem to jump from
  one end of the screen to the other.

I have taken great pains in the 2.3.x betas to prevent this.
Personally I couldn't find any 'window jumping' in a long time,
but if anybody sees something like this again I'm very grateful
for a bug report.  But - please check this against the latest
beta release (2.3.16 right now).  Otherwise you might report
problems that are already fixed.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Well, I did a vanilla install of fvwm-2.3.16 and made a very small
.fvwm2rc to demonstrate the problem, it's included below.

The first thing that I noticed was, well, I haven't been using icons for a
long time. That makes my subject header very misleading, sorry.

Iconify on an icon puts the window in the right place in 2.3.16,
yay! Sorry for stating otherwise.

The problem that I'm seeing is with the function that I use to retrieve
windows that I've iconified. I use a windowlist to retrieve iconified
windows and the function:

DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+       I       WindowId $0 Iconify off
+       I       WindowId $0 MoveToPage
+       I       WindowId $0 Raise
 
So, if you use the .fvwm2rc below, move a window so that the upper left
hand corner is off the current page, iconify it, right click on the root
window, left click on "Bring Me", and left click on the entry
corresponding to the iconified window, then the window pops up in the
"wrong" place. Use alt-right-mouse-button on a window to move it around.

This could be a problem with the WindowListFunc that I'm using or it could
be a non-obvious case of "window jumping". I'm not sure.

I'd like a little reassurance that the WindowListFunc above is reasonable
and that FVWM is really putting the window in the wrong place before
submitting a bug report. 

Thanks for your comments,

Ron

Okay, understood.  There is a bug, but it's not in 'iconify'.
MoveToPage moves the window even if it already is on the current
page.  I can fix that.  This is still an issue if the original
window position is not on the current viewport.  I wanted to clean
this up anyway before 2.4 is released.  Thanks for the reminder :-)

Uh, a lot, really. I just sent another message to the list that explains
what I left out and how I was confused.

In 2.2, I was commenting out:

    SetupFrame(t,new_x,new_y,
               t->frame_width,t->frame_height,False);
    t->Desk = Scr.CurrentDesk; */

inside the first 'if' in the function AutoPlace. That may have been
breaking something. I never noticed any breakage, but...

In 2.3.16, I had been commenting out some code in move_window_doit.
However, I just noticed tonight that it definitely was breaking some
window placement. Currently, I'm changing the following lines in
move_window_doit:

	    if(FinalX < 0)
	      FinalX += Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
    	    if(FinalY < 0)
      	      FinalY += Scr.MyDisplayHeight;

to:

	    if((FinalX + (int) width) < 0)
      	      FinalX += Scr.MyDisplayWidth;
	    if ((FinalY + (int) height) < 0)
              FinalY += Scr.MyDisplayHeight;

and I haven't noticed any breakage. I also don't know that that's anywhere
near the Right Thing(tm).

Right, sorry about that. In the mail that I just sent, I described a way
to reproduce what I was seeing...not what I said I was seeing.

Hi

Some applications I like to see all the time, also when 
another window is accidently placed on top of them. However,
when I use that particular window (which is on top of xclock),
ie, when that window has the input focus, I'd like it to be 
raised, until it loses the input focus again, then I'd like 
xclock to be on top again. Is it possible to configure such 
behaviour in fvwm?

best regads,

jos

Yes, with FvwmAuto.  You can configure FvwmAuto to call fvwm
functions when the mouse enters your window:

  AddToFunc my_enter_func
  + I Current (<specific unique window name>) Raise

  AddToFunc my_leave_func
  + I Next (<specific unique window name>) Lower

Try it with the current development code. Your problem should go away in
most cases.

Can I selectively add or remove decorations to a window (title, border etc)
based on window id.
What would it take to add this as a built in function to fvwm, so that I
could invoke this from a module.
Is there any other way I can solve this problem.

I am trying to run netscape in a kiosk mode.
I don't want the first window to have any decorations, but subsequent
windows need decorations.

Please help

I don't think there's any way to do what you're asking. At least, not
for now.

But I can offer this workaround:

When Netscape first starts, it sets the title to something long and
obnoxious. In my experience, startup is the *only* time the title is
set this way, so you could do something like:

Style Netscape Title
Style "Netscape: Version foo blah blah blah" NoTitle

This should more or less do what you're trying to do.

Hello,

I am still wondering why can't treat $$0 - $$9 as a special cases and
expand them only within functions. I don't think this would lead to
a loss of functionality since the positional parameters are used only
within functions. Perhaps there is something else I'm not aware of.
BTW, having to quote four times is better than having to quote eight
times: thanks for the bugfix!

Best Regards,

Neil

Folks.

I am running:

obeauche@tyro{1:10pm}:~:>fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.15 compiled on Apr 18 2000 at 14:45:09
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  XPM Session

on a: 

obeauche@tyro{1:10pm}:~:>uname -a
SunOS tyro 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

and I also have a SunPCi card installed. Here's the problem:

I use the meta keys to switch between the virtual screens, which works
fine unless I meta over to the virtual screen that the SunPCi window is
on. If the mouse pointer is sitting in the Windows screen, I am not able
to meta to the adjacent virtual screens. I suspect that an attempt of fvwm
to fix this would break the SunPCi's ability to attach the workstation's
periferals, keyboard, mouse etc to it rather than the Sun... but thought
I'd ask anyhow to confirm or to get any brilliant ideas. I do suspect that
this is a neccesity for sunPCi to work though...

Thanks. 
Olivier

Hello,

I have the following iconbox set up in my .fvwm2rc:

Style * IconBox 62x800+0+519

My understanding is that whenever a window gets iconified fvwm2 should
attempt to place it in the rectangular icon box shown below:

+-----------------------------+
|                             |
|          Desktop            |
|                             |
+---------------------+       |
|                     |       |
|  Icon Box           |       |
|                     |       |
+---------------------+       |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+

This works when fvmw2 starts up but if I later iconify a window it ends
up at the upper left hand corner of my desktop and then following icons
end up in the same column.

What is wrong here? (I am running fvwm2 version 2.3.17).

Thanks,

Neil

62 is the width, your iconbox should be tall and narrow.

Are you filling up the first icon box?
After the 62x800 box fills up it will use the builtin icon box that
behaves like the one you describe.

Hello all,

 I'm seeing problems with my focusing. I've checked both the XFree86 and
fvwm faqs without luck. If anyone can give me any pointers on what to
look at for a fix, I'd appreciate it, 'cause this is annoying.

 I'm using FocusFollowsMouse and it works most the the time, but I'm seeing
the following problems:

 1) about 1 time in 10 when I move the mouse from one window to another,
the focus fails to follow and the first window retains the focus. The
same is true moving from the root window to a window, 1 time in 10 the
window will fail to receive focus.

 2) when new windows appear and the mouse cursor is already in them, they
don't always receive focus.

 3) Very rarely, once a week, I see a situation where one window apparently
has focus (i.e. it's highlighted) , but another window is receiving the
keyboard input. In this situation I usually have to iconify the window
receiving keyboard input in order to get another window to receive it.

 I don't beleive I've always had this problem, it seemed to appear one
day, but I haven't been able to discover what actions I did to cause it's
appearance. I didn't upgrade X or fvwm2 or anything obvious to me.

 My .fvwmrc2 file contains the following line, plus a handful of other
lines for specific apps that state they are 'ClockToFocus':

Style "*"           FocusFollowsMouse

 My versions are:

Fvwm Version 2.2.2
XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 / X Window System
Red Hat Linux release 6.0 (Hedwig)
Kernel 2.2.5-15 on an i686

Thanks in advance,

Von

  I have this in config (fvwm 2.2.4):

fvwm-theme:#Style "*" ClickToFocus
fvwm-theme:#Style "*" MouseFocus
fvwm-theme:Style "*" SloppyFocus
fvwm-theme:Style "xload"           NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip,
ClickToFocus  

...
> Style "*"           FocusFollowsMouse

  it looks like it changed since 2.2.2

  I think the best way to go is to update to last stable version...

  I noticed that over time lot of little quirks/inconveniences
disappeared (the newer versions are less buggy)...

Hi,

   I'm using Exceed and I can't cross (by mouse/pointer dragging) to
neighbouring desktops below and to the right, but I can go up and left.
My guess is that the zero valued horizontal and vertical edges are well
defined and understood by both exceed and X, but the right & bottom
edges are troublesome.

 I've fiddled around with:

EdgeResistance 125 1
EdgeScroll 100 100
EdgeThickness 1

Setting them with a bunch of different settings but never saw any
improvement.

I have noticed that on the PC/NT side the screen is 1152x864 but on the
Unix side
xrdb -symbols reveals that  -DWIDTH=1152 -DHEIGHT=845, I assume that the
missing 11 is due to the taskbasr, but the taskbar isn't even displayed
on the X side, and I'm under the assumption that a smaller value on the
X side would mean that scrolling south would bring up the lower desktop
sooner??  Confused.

HELP!!!


Thanks,

Ian

Hi,

   I am still not able to get the xpm icon stuff to work. I included in
the
.fvwm2rc (I am using fvwm-2.2.4) the following lines:

 .....

  Style "XTerm"       Icon xterm-sol.xpm, SloppyFocus, IconBox -70 1 -1
-140

 .....

  *FvwmButtons(1x2 Title Xterm, Icon terra.xbm, Action `Exec xterm&`)

 .....

But still when I iconify xterm I am getting a small rectangular box.
And in the buttonbar, I am only getting the string "Xterm" but not
the icon "terra.xpm".

I tried other xpm icons for other applications and I got the same thing.

Can you help me?

Thanks

N.B.: I set the icon and pixmap to where the xpm are located.

Style "*term"          Icon    xterm-sol.xpm

I tried it, but no success. I installed fvwm95 and it worked but it is
using all the color map so I preferred to use fvwm2. I am really starting
to have a head ache because of this icon stuff. Sorry guys.!!!!

Sorry to see you having all these problems.  Heres some advice,
when all else fails, use the source.

Go into fvwm/icons.c and add "fprintfs" at strategic locations.

For this problem, you want to print in "CreateIconWindow" and
"GetXPMFile".

If your not a programmer, send me some mail, and we will work it out.

  yes, you're right, I just tried it.

  you can only move it using middle mouse button in the pager itself
(that way you can move it to any screen within any desktop that is
displayd in pager).

Using the second mouse button in a multidesk pager (Module FvwmPager 0 3)
or using a MoveToDesk command. For example, you can create a menu:

AddToMenu MenuMoveToDesk
+ "Move to desk 0" MoveToDesk 0 0
+ "Move to desk 1" MoveToDesk 0 1
+ "Move to desk 2" MoveToDesk 0 2
+ "Move to desk 3" MoveToDesk 0 3

Mikhael.

It sounds like you can't move the mouse to the right or bottom edge of
the screen from Exceed's point of view.  On the windows taskbar do a
right button click to get the menu up and select tools/configuration. 
In the configuration window double click "Screen Definition". You can
either try enabling "Full Screen" or changing the root size to something
smaller (e.g. 1000 x 750).  If that still desn't work try setting
EdgeThickness to 2.

Cheers,
Tim.

If you have > 1 desktop displayed in your pager

[* FvwmPagerColumns 2, I think...]

then you can 'pick up' the miniwindow in the pager with the middle mouse
button and move it around on the pager.

i can't seem to configure the pager's desktop to be an arbitrary number
of screens in a MxN configuration... it seems that the pager's desktops
are only 4 screens in a 2x2 config...

also... there doesnt seem to be any way to change the key bindings to
allow me to switch between the screens of the desktop

Generally you want to tell FVWM itself that you want more pages. For
example:

DeskTopSize 1x12

Then Pager picks this up.

man fvwm2
/GotoPage

Should do it for you. Were you looking in the docs for FvwmPager for
this? Again, it's in the fvwm2 core.

FvwmPager isn't responsible for virtualizing the desktop -- it just
shows you that you have them. fvwm itself creates the virtual
desktops.

  you can have as many desktops as you want (well, I guess there's some
limit) each having MxN screens.

  use:

how many desktops you want:

     *FvwmPagerRows rows
          Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to  use  when  laying
          out the pager window.


     *FvwmPagerColumns columns
          Tells fvwm how many columnss of desks to use when  lay-
          ing out the pager window.

how many screens each desktop has:

DeskTopSize 4x3



> also... there doesnt seem to be any way to change the key bindings to
> allow me to switch between the screens of the desktop

  try these:

# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100
Key Down	A	C	Scroll +0   +100

# press arrow + meta key, and scroll by 1/10 of a page
Key Left	A	CM	Scroll -20 +0
Key Right	A	CM	Scroll +20 +0
Key Up		A	CM	Scroll +0   -20
Key Down	A	CM	Scroll +0   +20

# erik: Alt-Fn to go to a specific page (like on the Linux console)
Key F1		A	M	GotoPage 0 0
Key F2		A	M	GotoPage 1 0
Key F3		A	M	GotoPage 2 0
Key F4		A	M	GotoPage 3 0

Look at the SetEnv command in the fvwm2 manpage.

	 SetEnv variable value

Fvwm may read those variables.  I don't think "manage" is the
right word.

"Normal" UNIX behavior is for a parent process to pass all environment
variables to its children.  You can export variables before you invoke
fvwm to get the variables to the process fvwm starts.

You haven't mentioned the release of fvwm you use, but
fvwm has had the "SetEnv" command for a long time,
check the man page for your version.

Hi all,

Thanks for the helps...Unfortunately it did not solve my problem though.  It
may be something that the window manger cannot handle, and I may have to
recompile X with certain options.  My problem is that I have a dual-monitor
setup.  One DISPLAY name is :0.0 and the other s :0.1.  They are both
controled by Fvwm, but it seems like everything is independently controled
for each display. Even if I open a multi-desktop pager on one of the
terminals, all these virtual desktops belong to that monitor.  The only way
to open an object on the othter monitor is to set the DISPLAY environment on
the first monitor to :0.1 and then open the window.  Unfortunatelyh, this
does not solve my pronblem of wanting to move windows once they are placed
on one desktop on a particular monitor.  I hope it is clear what I am trying
to say!

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Or if you know for sure that the Win
manager can not take care of this problem, I would like to know also.

Thanks again.

-Arya

  I think you're right about this not being WM problem. the two monitors
are behaving as two independent displays on X level. you need to
configure X so that both of them are one, it can be done with latest X
(under certain conditions). just my $.2, I don't have any personal
experience with multi-headed X.

Hi!


I am sorry if this was explained before, but:

Can someone send to me his .fvwm2rc configuration file that
describes CDE-like look of fvwm2? I managed to get something
that resembles front panel, but it is still secret (to me)
how to make menus that go upwards, like in CDE.

I think that should be achieved by using FvwmButtons module,
but I am not quite sure.


All the best,

Zoltan

As noted by another poster, your suspicion that this isn't a window
management issue is correct. It's an X server thing. Specifically,
what you're looking for is called Xinerama, and is part of the latest
X11R6.4 specification. XFree86 4.0 supports Xinerama. I don't know the
status of commercial Unix support for X11R6.4 or Xinerama.

i was under the impression that active placement would allow me to place
a new window via moving the mouse pointer and clicking where i want the
window placed...

this doesnt seem to be the behavior that i get and there is no entry in
the man page for ActivePlacement that describes what it does...

ideally what i would like is for a new window to be placed where the
mouse pointer is automatically - without clicking... is this possible?

That's exactly what it does - but only if you do not use RandomPlacement.
The right style line to get the behaviour you want is

  Stype * ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

There is a man page section in the latest beta versions.

With the current development code.  You can set up FvwmEvent
to trigger this command whenever a new window is created:

  Move pointer

This should do the trick.  You'll need one of the 2.3.x betas, though.

Hi

I compiled the newest snapshot (20000519) with gnome

when the root menu pops up, I can see the entries appear

Hello,

I wonder if it is possible to do the following with fvwm2: I would like to
have a function bound to a titlebar button that does the following:

- Upon first click the window is maximized horizontally.
- Upon second click the window is expanded so that its right border 
  touches the right side of the viewport immediately to the window's
  right.
- Upon third click the above step is repeated so that the window occupies
  three viewports (the original one and the two to its right).
- At the nth click the window occupies n viewports, etc...

Thanks for your help,

Neil Zanella

Hi,

Just a guess, but I seem to remember hearing this one before.  If I
remember correctly in that case "debugging" was turned on by default.  I
can't remember the specifics, but suggest you dig through the makefile, or
README...

Best o' luck,

Tom

I don't think this is possible with fvwm. Something very clunky might
be possible by going "outside" to a PipeRead, but even that doesn't
exactly seem promising.

I am not familar with a cde-like configuration utilizing the latest fvwm
features, it would interesing to have (as a theme).

A simple web search using words "fvwm2rc" "CDE" "FvwmButtons" returns
some old configs, for example this one (there is md6.gif screenshot):

  http://www.go.dlr.de/linux/src/.warix/Panel-CDEm-v3.0.tgz.html

To make menus to be posted up, use menu position hints (see the man page):

  Menu PanelSubMenu Root +200p o100-64p  # bottom-left corner at +200-64

Mikhael.

O, where did you get the cde like front panel, i'd be interested.
There is also xfce which is kind of like a cde-clone. It has a front
panel, window manager and several other items. Because it is modular, 
it is possible to use only the front panel with fvwm as window manager.
This way, you can get a good cde-like look. (see http://www.xfce.org )

	The link that Mikhael referenced - 

  http://www.go.dlr.de/linux/src/.warix/Panel-CDEm-v3.0.tgz.html


- points to an old version of Matt Baron's Panel. The latest link I have
to his Panel page is

  http://www.visi.com/~mbaron//panel/


The link is still alive, but I don't think Matt's been actively working
on it for a long time. As I recall, Panel is supposed to be a generic
CDE panel look-alike that should work with any window manager, but had
some special extensions for working with FVWM - I don't remember just
what. If it used the module interface, I doubt that that part will be
anywhere near up to date.

	I used it for a while a few years ago, and it seemed pretty slick. But
I like a clean desktop, so I tend to stop using things like task bars
and control panels as soon as the new wears off.

	Writing CDE clones was a popular activity some 3 or 4 years ago, but
interest seems to have waned. Another popular one was Orlando Andico's
FvwmCDE, but it and he seem to have disappeared; I gave up trying to
locate him a couple of years ago. I don't know anything about the
current status of xfce.


Cheers,
Bob

I am a newbie (greenie) to AnotherLook,
FVWM2.  In general I do not understand
the config files very well, and what
I do understand does not seem to be
working properly. 

For example, the Geometry attribute of
the Pager does not work.  For a while, 
it mysteriously started working after
I changed a background color, then,
stopped working just as suddely and
mysteriously.  

If there is any good docs or other 
resources, or someone willing to spoon
feed me a bit, please let me know.  

Perhaps someone already has some config
files that are posted?  

P.S. I use RH6.2

Peter,

First let me suggest that you do not edit the files directly.  This way
you always have a working set-up to go back to in case of trouble.  When
things work as you like then make changes if you prefer.  Instead, copy
the file you want to edit to your home directory and rename it with a "."
in front and droping the ".m4" suffix.

fvwm2rc.modules.m4 -> ~/.fvwm2rc.modules

As for tutorials and docs on editing the files, all I can suggest is the
man pages for fvwm2 and m4 man pages.  The AnotherLevel package is just m4
preprocessing and fvwm2.  Besides that the people on this list are very
helpful. 

As for the Scale and Geometry not working, look at the fvwm2rc.modules.m4
file and note the section on FvwmButtons above the section on
FvwmPager.  See the Swallow command.  What you see as the pager is a
swallowed app, so the configuration of FvwmButtons also modifies
(currently constrains) the size of the pager.

There were some bugs in the FvwmPager's
geometry attributes in earlier versions.
Download the latest beta version of
fvwm2 from www.fvwm.org and this should
be fixed.

The colors are fine when I just have
a pager in my ButtonBox, but when I 
try to add another button to it the 
colors change, some turning black.  

Can anyone tell me what causes this?

Thx

in the file:

/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/decors/MWM,
 
there are some colors defined such as 
"grey51", "grey35", etc.  

Where are these colors defined?  I ran

 find / -exec grep "grey51" {} \; -print

and didnt' come up with anything (although
I may have killed it before it finished).

Thanks again!

Well, you should start by explaining some more. Your display appears
to be 1152x864 in Windows, correct? And somehow your Exceed server's
area is supposed to be 1152x845? Are you running Exceed in a window,
or "full screen" except the taskbar? What you're describing sounds
very distinctly like the bottom and right edges of your X display are
being cropped by the Windows border.

Try issuing:

xterm -geometry 80x24-0-0

If any portion of the xterm window doesn't appear, then your display
is clearly cropped and you need to resize the Exceed window
appropriately.

HTH,

Hello,

Perhaps this is a little bit off topic but does anyone know of
a better way to figure out the color depth than examining the
XF86Config file? The XF86Config man page says: when more than
one Display subsection is present in a Screen section the depth
determines which gets used by the X server. The subsection
used is the one matching the depth at which the X server is run at.   

Now how do I find out at which depth the X server is run at? I know
that the X server is restarted after one logs in with xdm but I'm
not sure about what happens after that.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

Hi,
I'm novice with FVWM, and I have a small problem. I'm running LICQ
0.76 with QT GUI plugin 0.71 with appearance option "Use Dock Icon"
checked. Dock icon runs in separate window named "LicqWharf". At this
moment I'm trying to swallow this window in FvwmGoodStuff. I have
following line in my .fvwm2rc :

*FvwmGoodStuff  licq  licqIcon-sun.xpm Swallow "LicqWharf"

but it does not work. Should I add  Exec licq to that line?

  it looks like the X server does not have enough colors available,
check the depth using xdpyinfo... depending on the video card you might
be able to increase the number of colors.

If the above suggestion turns out to be the case (you are out of
colors):

1. Start Netscape with "-install".
2. Use a recent version fvwm2.  In the 2.x series, you need the
"ColorLimit" command.

Hello,

I just upgraded from XFree86 3.3.2.3 to XFree86 3.6 by
installing the binary distribution from scratch under
/usr/X11R6 after backing up my /usr/X11R6 to /usr/X11R6.bak.
The twm window manager started from xdm works fine and is
configured as the default window manager. After reconfiguring
and renaming some files (such as /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xclients
and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/Xsession) I tried to run fvwm2
in place of twm as my default window manager. However, I get
the following error in my ~/.xsession-errors file:

/usr/local/bin/fvwm2: error in loading shared libraries
libXpm.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

After looking under my /usr/X11R6 tree it looks like the Xpm library
file libXpm.so.4 is not part of XFree86 and was installed there
separately. I tried making a symbolic link to the same file under
my /usr/X11R6.bak tree but this did not solve my problem and the same
error kept on appearing in my ~/.xsession-errors when I logged in
with xdm.

At this point it seems like the only way to get rid of this problem
is to reinstall the Xpm library files from scratch.

Where do I get the Xpm library files from?
Has anyone experienced this problem before?
Does anyone have any alternative suggestions?

Thanks,

bummer...

On my system I get

$ rpm -ql xpm
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.11
$ rpm -q xpm
xpm-3.4k-1

So if you use rpm's then apparently you could just download this from
rufus or something.

HTH,

It's not a terribly difficult installation. For more information:

Sticking to the packaged setups is generally easier to do and allows
you to solve problems like these more easily. OTOH, people on OSes
like Solaris have to toddle over to sunfreeware.com to pick up all the
necessities Sun forgot to put on their CDs, like gcc, perl and Xpm (I
hear they've finally addressed the issue in Solaris8).

Thanks for your feedback. I am running Red Hat Linux 5.2 and
my installation had come with xpm-3.4j-3 (output of rpm -q xpm).
I downloaded the xpm package from <ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/>
version 3.4k which seems to install fine since I get no error messages.
Among other things after installation I have:

$ ls -l /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm*
lrwxrwxrwx   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so -> libXpm.so.4.11
lrwxrwxrwx   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4 -> libXpm.so.4.11
-rwxr-xr-x   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.11

What is rufus? Can you please give me a complete domain name for rufus?
Also, what is your output of rpm -ql xpm and what version of Red Hat
Linux and XFree86 do you have installed?

Thanks,

Neil

I agree but I must have done something wrong because when I try to
launch netscape I get the following error:

/usr/lib/netscape/netscape-communicator: error in loading shared libraries
libXpm.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The same happens to me when I try to recompile fvwm2 with xpm support
since fvwm2's configure script does not find the files from my fresh
xpm installation.

Do I have to recompile my whole system to get things to work now?

On one hand I agree since after all I haven't had much luck with
xpm-3.4k.tar.gz (although I the problem I am experiencing seems
a bit of a puzzle). On the other hand an rpm might have dependencies
such as a newer glibc (I am still running glibc 2.0).

Why aren't applications able find my shared library files?
After all they are installed in a very standard location.
Do I need some extra symlinks?

Thanks,

Neil

Thanks for all the effort of fvwm developer team,

I am not subscribing the ML's, and I don't know if I am right to send this
report here, but I would like to try.

Now I am trying fvwm-2.3.17, and I am glad that it works right in both
maximizing and shading at the same time, but found that the color
control relating MWMButtons is not correctly working.

>From the old days, MWM* style is my favourite, and current setup in my
~/.fvwm2rc is:

ButtonStyle 2 5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 16 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0 \
         80x80@0  70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1
ButtonStyle All -- Flat
         <snip>
Style "*"           MWMBorder,MWMButtons,MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride

but at least the MWMButtons is not working correctly.  My rightmost button
(my maximizer button: Button 2 ?) does not keep track with my color
settings if the window is maximized.  In my case, assuming a title
and button styles like this:

TitleStyle ActiveUp Vgradient 24 #666666 #999999 -- flat
TitleStyle ActiveDown Vgradient 24 #555555 #999999  -- flat
TitleStyle Inactive Vgradient 24 #11236b #03092b -- flat
ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle flat

the rightmost button of active window is light gray (perhaps #999999)
and has no gradient, while that of inactive window turns into dark
gray (perhaps #555555, even if the intended color for inactive window
should be dark blue sort of Vgradient #11236b #03092b).

The color control of the button is correct if the relevant window is
in non-maximized state (including the Vgradient), and shape control is
just perfect even when maximized (only the color control is not working).

I have a screen shot of the malfunctioning button, and if you can't reproduce
the symptom, I would try to publish the image as one of the screen shot in
my dired-dd page (http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~pi9s-nnb/dired-dd-home.html).

The same .fvwm2rc setup is working correctly in fvwm-2.2.2 and 2.2.4.

My temporary fix is removing the MWMButtons mnemonic in the setup.
I can't take time to look the src at all yet, sorry.

Sincerely,

PS.
I am Sorry, but I am not subscribing the lists, so please use Cc:, or

Ah! The make install installed the .so files and the .h file but
not the .a file. So I need all of them. Huh! I installed the package
according to the installation instruction so why did it not get installed:

xmkmf -a
make
make install
make install.man

What did I do wrong?

So after installing, your Xpm lib still isn't usable for linking...
Seems strange. What's the output of 'make install' when you install
Xpm? You should have the following things:

/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/xpm.h

What happens if you do ldd against some Xpm-dependant binary? For
example:

$ ldd /usr/lib/netscape/netscape-communicator

All in all, I'm baffled by your problem with Xpm.

Hello,

I find the xpm installation program a bit strange. It seems
that you can only build either the static library or the
shared library in one go but not both at once. To build
the shared library I had to uncomment the following line
in the Imakefile:

IMAKE_DEFINES = -DSharedLibXpm=NO

This gave me the required .a file so now I have:

$ ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm*
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so       /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.11

However I still get the same errors:

[~/fvwm-2.3.17]# ./configure
checking for X11/xpm.h... yes
checking for Xpm 3.4g or better... no

This is very strange. I have Xpm 3.4k! What exactly is configure
checking for?

Thanks,

Best Regards,

Neil

Depending on your instalation method, you may also need to run ldconfig.

The standard reply. If you have configure problems, first take a look at
config.log, you should see why "checking for Xpm 3.4g or better" failed.

Also at the end, the real xpm problem should be displayed, like:
  Have XPM support?                  no: Xpm library version is too old!

Mikhael.

Is /usr/X11R6/lib in your /etc/ld.so.conf?
Have you run ldconfig since installing Xpm?

Other than that, the approach I usually take with configure is to zero in
on the bit of the script that is doing the check and dumping a load of
'echo' statements in there to find out what it's doing: Often configure 
will create a temp .c file and try to compile, link and run it to see if a
library is there: If any of those stages fail, configure thinks the
library is unavailable. Alternatively, If something worked in
Xpm-3.4[ghij] but isn't quite the same in Xpm-3.4k, than you'd get the
same symptom...

You need to tell fvwm2 WHICH button is the Maximize button.  Check your fvwm2
manual page and look for the description of the ButtonStyle keyword...
specifically, the MwmDecorMaximize hint.

The ldconfig man page says that ldconfig is normally run  automatically
at bootup from /etc/rc. I do not have a file or directory called /etc/rc
on my system although I have a directory called /etc/rc.d containing
many files including /etc/rc.d/rc. None of these files contain the string
ldconfig so I assume that my Red Hat 5.2 box was not set up for this and
I have to run ldconfig manually. I have never used ldconfig before nor was
I aware of the existence of this tool. I shall log in as root and run
"/sbin/ldconfig -v" and hope that fixes it...

  Have XPM support?                  yes

Hurray!

I really think that the ldconfig step should have been done by the xpm
installation script or should have at least been mentioned in the
documentation. Oh well...

Thanks,

Neil

I could not find the word RPlay in the fvwm2 man page. What is it
and how do I get it?

Rufus is another site I usually go to for rpms.

http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/

It's a nice repository...  I'm using RH6.1, for xpm I get

[maxwell: ~/]$ rpm -qi xpm
Name        : xpm                          Relocations: (not relocateable)
Version     : 3.4k                              Vendor: Red Hat Software
Release     : 1                             Build Date: Mon Aug 30
12:08:13 1999
Install date: Sat Mar 11 15:54:27 2000      Build Host:
porky.devel.redhat.com
Group       : System Environment/Libraries   Source RPM:
xpm-3.4k-1.src.rpm
Size        : 61647                            License: MIT
Packager    : Red Hat Software <http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla>
Summary     : A pixmap library for the X Window System.
Description :
The xpm package contains the XPM pixmap library for the X Window
System.  The XPM library allows applications to display color,
pixmapped images, and is used by many popular X programs.

[maxwell: ~/]$ rpm -ql xpm
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.11

and for XFree86 I get...

[maxwell: ~/]$ rpm -q XFree86
XFree86-3.3.5-3

Both of these are directly from the RH6.1 distribution.

As for the Xpm library you installed it looks like the packager just
thought that some programs might get confused by the suffix, so added a
couple links to other names.

  in addition to other info posted here:

  if ldd shows that the library is not found and you know that you have
given library installed (either you remember installing it or you used
find to find it), you can use LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable to
make ld look for libraries in that directory (that's mostly to try stuff
out, for real solution you usually want to add the path to /etc/ld.conf
and run ldconfig (or just run ldconfig)).

There have been a lot of questions and answers, I just wanted to note a
few things:

 1) My opinion is that the method you used to upgrade X wasn't optimal.
    There are a ton of things installed in the typical /usr/X11R6 which
    don't come with X itself.  I suspect you'll find that xpm is just
    the tip of the iceberg for missing tools and libraries.

    What I would recommend, if you can't or don't want to use your
    package management system to do the upgrade (which would be my first
    choice) is that you make a complete _copy_ of your existing
    /usr/X11R6 directory, as a backup.  Then install the new one _on top
    of_ your existing hierarchy, instead of separately.

    That way you should keep all your existing libraries, plus add the
    new ones (they're all different .so versions, etc.), and get all the
    new servers and standard X apps while still keeping the ones that
    don't come with X.

 2) Xpm uses Imake which... well, let's face it, Imake sucks.  That's
    why it's so much more obscure and difficult to build than your
    typical autoconf package.  But, since Xpm is almost always provided
    pre-built these days it just doesn't seem worthwhile to fix it.

 3) The reason Xpm doesn't run ldconfig on install is that many systems
    don't have or need it, and Xpm builds on any X-based system.  Also,
    ldconfig requires root permissions and many people don't install as
    root.  I agree it _could_ be added to the docs as a "you may need
    to..." note, but... see #2 :).

 4) You don't need the libXpm.a file, unless you want to build Xpm
    statically into an app.  The .a files are not used in any way during
    dynamic linking.

  you're sidestepping the issue. even if the dsp part is completely
independent we still need the gui part for completeness (VST experience
shows that it is needed/used).

  so one way or another the LADSPA should (IMO) specify the
visual/control part (as opposed to audio/dsp part).

  of course, the ui and back-end dsp processing should be as independent
as possible (but notmore and ui should not be completely ignored/left
out).

Hi Dominik.

THanks again for your help below.  Just one problem...
WindowList (CurrentPage) works just fine
WindowList (xterm) also works fine

However,
WindowList (xterm, CurrentPage)
does not work (returns an empty list). Am I doing something wrong?

Also, where is the most uptodate man pages for these features.  The man
pages on the fvwm web site does not talk about these as I believe it is for
an older version of fvwm.

THanks again.

Arya

Hi Dominik.

THanks again for your help below.  Just one problem...
WindowList (CurrentPage) works just fine
WindowList (xterm) also works fine

However,
WindowList (xterm, CurrentPage)
does not work (returns an empty list). Am I doing something wrong?

Also, where is the most uptodate man pages for these features.  The man
pages on the fvwm web site does not talk about these as I believe it is for
an older version of fvwm.

THanks again.

Arya

Dear fvwm gurus,

in my ~/.fvwm2rc, I have

    ClickTime 150

    Mouse 1 T A Move-or-Raise

    AddToFunc Move-or-Raise  "C" Raise
    +                        "M" Move

This lets me grab and move a window by its title bar, or if I just click
on the title bar, the window is raised -- just as I want it. There's
one funny thing, though: If I start moving the mouse less than 150 ms
after pressing the left mouse button, the pointer moves as expected, but
the window does not. It only starts moving after ClickTime has passed.
Unfortunately, it doesn't jump to catch up with the mouse, either; the
window frame and the mouse pointer move synchronously, but the mouse
pointer may be dozens of pixels displaced from the title bar and remain
constant at this distance.

This behaviour slightly gets in my way when I want to bring a window
such that its title bar is close to the upper border of the screen --
as I cannot move the mouse pointer beyond the border, I have to grab
the window again, patiently wait until the cursor shape changes from a
bullet to a four way arrow, and then do the movement.

Is there any way to work around this? Am I doing something foolish? I
must admit that my ~/.fvwm2rc file is a result of hacking about in a
sample that came with some Linux distrib, so I may well use some less
than optimal technique here...

Greetinx & thanx in advance,
Jan

I just had a look at <http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/>.
Nice site. Too bad they don't have rpms for XFree86 3.3.6.

So perhaps I did not need to build /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a by uncommenting
IMAKE_DEFINES = -DSharedLibXpm=NO in the Imakefile and all I needed to do
is run /sbin/ldconfig -v. Do you have /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a? If so what
is the output of rpm -qf /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a?

...just wondering.

Thanks,

Neil

No I do not have a libXpm.a .  Also you probably do not need a libXpm.a .
I'm fairly sure that someone has already said this, but files with a ".a"
suffix are for building executeables with the library "staticly
(sp?) linked", while ".so" files are dynamicly linked libraries.  All you
should need is a ".so" file unless you are trying to do some sort of code
devel.  So, all in all, you probably just needed to do the install and run
ldconfig.

You have one screen

You have one visual

which is a TrueColor.

What this all means is that your graphics card can display bazillions of
colors and if something isn't displaying the correct colors it isn't
because the card has run out. It's more likely to be a configuration
problem with the client.

This is a well-known bug in FVWM-2.2.2, as far as I know. So if you're
using FVWM-2.2.2, that's why. I believe this has been corrected in
2.2.4, so an upgrade would solve your problem. The only workaround
I've found is to set ClickTime to 0, a somewhat strange solution. But
who needs double-clicking anyway :-)

You also need -libs, -devel, -75dpi-fonts and your specific X server.

Hi All,

I am trying to define various styles for various applications. In doing so I
have a line like:

Style "Cadence" Icon .....

The way fvwm seems to recognize the window as belonging to this class is by
the "Resource" field (if you do an identify on that window). My question is:
is there a way to recognize a particular class by looking at the "Name"
field?  THe reason is that my "Resource" forks out quite a few windows and I
want to have different Styles for these windows. The only way to do that is
to use the "Name" field.

THanks very much.

Arya

          stylename can be a window's name,  class,  or  resource
          string.   It  may  contain  the  wildcards '*' and '?',
          which are matched in the usual  Unix  filename  manner.
          They  are  searched  in the reverse order stated.  When
          two conflicting styles apply to the  same  window,  the
          style that was changed last wins.


In a future release, we plan to enhance the style matching so that
you can control whether name, class, or resource is used in the
match.  (The above excerpt explains that they are all used currently.)

I keep a newer version of fvwm in my home directory at work (company
version is like 2.0.42 or something).  When I restart fvwm from a popup
menu, it restarts the globally installed (older) version.  Does fvwm
have a variable to select an fvwm executable to run when restarting, or
do I need to modify my search path, or what?

Sounds like a path thing: when you start it, do you explicitly state the
path to the binary?

  you have enough colors (all colors, as far as computer is concerned,
that is)

Just plain "Restart" executes the first "fvwm2" in your path.
2.3.x versions of fvwm let you restart using the full path name
of an fvwm2 version.

Look up "Restart" in your man page.

Ahhh..
I did not realize I could specify a full pathname here in the menu
setup.  I just made the following change and all is well:

+       "Restart"       Restart fvwm2

to

+       "Restart"       Restart /homes/so/dwandell/bin/fvwm2

Thanks for the clue, it seems so obvious now...:)

Can fvwm access the X buffer in any way?  What I am trying to do is modify pasting so the contents of the buffer are modified based on a regular expression if I paste (middle mouse button) to a title bar instead of the window of the xterm.

Any direction?  Would this be the work of a module?  FvwmXBuffer?? ;-)

Well, there's the xselection program, which can perform operations on the
current selection or one of the cut buffers.  If you can have it called upon
a middle-click on the title bar, you should be able to do any processing
you want.  Of course, this doesn't actually paste anything into the
enclosed window; that's probably way out of the scope of the window manager.

I doubt this has enough to do with Fvwm to be built into it.

Hello,

I recently went to the fvwm2 website to download the announced version
of fvwm (version 2.3.18) but the tarball is missing from the ftp site.
The web page <http://www.fvwm.org/download.html> was modified at least
12 hours ago. What happened to the tarball?

Thanks,

Neil

It's because of the comma (',') after the string "xterm" for some
obscure reason it is interpreted as part of the name.  This does
work:

  WindowList (xterm CurrentPage)
                  ^^

The man page you have should always match the executable, i.e. if
something is not documented it is not there.  Well, I know that in
the past some features were not documented at all.  The man page on
the web site always refers to the latest stable release (i.e. 2.2.4
at the moment).  The very latest code and man page is in the current
beta release (2.3.17) or development snapshot.  You can find the
instructions how to download either on our 'downloads' page.

You don't say which release you are using.  This bug is fixed in the
current beta versions (2.3.x) and - I believe - also in the last
stable release (2.2.4).

Yes, of course this is possible.  Since I'm a fvwm developer I can't
tell you exactly how to disable GNOME, though.  I will forward your
question to the fvwm mailing list (fvwm@fvwm.org).

As far as I know the maximum rate is 250ms delay and 30 characters per
second.  With XFree86 you don't have to use command line arguments
though.  You can put the AutoRepeat option in the XFree config file.
>From the man page ("man XF86Config"):

      AutoRepeat delay rate
           changes the behavior of the autorepeat of the key=AD
           board.  This does not work on all platforms.

Put this in the "Keyboard" section.  You can also use the command
"xset r rate <delay> <rate>", but the config file solution is better.

Did you see any difference using diffirent MoveSmoothness values?
It was decided to remove this command to improve code maintainability.

Hrm.. I noticed that when it was turned to make it more unsmooth, it
defintely did make it more choppy :)

As for the other direction, I leave it set to MoveSmoothness 1 so I don't
notice. Is 1 the default?

I was just wondering what happened since it became an invalid command.

I am also getting:

[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'FINISHED_STARTUP'
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'FINISHED_STARTUP'
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'FINISHED_STARTUP'
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'UNLOCK'
[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'FINISHED_STARTUP'

Any ideas why?

What happens is that gnome-session is started and it already starts all
session clients (like gmc icons). You want to ensure that fvwm2 is started
instead of gnome-session.

Depending on your distribution the following tips may or may not work.
Create a file ~/.Xclients containing one line "fvwm2". If you want to
bypass any logic you can create a file ~/.xinitrc with one line "fvwm2".

Mikhael.

The modules you are using don't match the fvwm core.  The messages
'FINISHED_STARTUP' and 'UNLOCK' have been removed, but your
modules still use it.  You have to update the modules too.

1) You seem to use a *very* old version of fvwm.  You should
   really consider updating to the stable version 2.2.4.  The
   FvwmGoodStuff module has been renamed to FvwmButtons a long
   time ago.  I'm not sure if the syntax is still the same,
   but if it is ...
2) ... yes, you have to add "Exec licq" to this line:

     *FvwmButtons licq licqIcon-sun.xpm Swallow "LicqWharf" "Exec licq"

Well, and of course you have to make sure that the new window
really has "LicqWharf" as it's title.  Otherwise FvwmButtons
won't find it.

With the patch I have just made it's possible:

  AddToFunc MaximizeWidthMult
  + i piperead "echo maximize on $$[(($[w.width] + 50) / $[vp.width]) * 100 + 100] 0"

This works with zsh, but probably also with bash, sh, ...
The interesting parts are the outer '$$[...]' which is a
quoted shell arithmetic expansion ($[...]) and the inner
$[w.width] which is replaced by the window's width by fvwm
and the $[vp.width] (viewport width).  The +50 rounds up the
window's width in case the viewport width is not a multiple
of the window's width_inc.

The patches are fairly trivial.  In fact writing the new
parameters (see ChangeLog and man page) brought up half
a dozen bugs in the expansion code that were already there :-p
So I allowed me to commit these changes without asking for
votes first (I hope nobody takes offense - it's just that
the patch is trivial and fixes more core dumps than is could
possibly cause :-) )

Hi Domink,

Thank again.  Your suggestion works.  One (hopefully!) last question on this
subject...

Is there a way to show windows with certain "ID"  AND others with a different ID
displayed?  In other words, if I want the windows with identifier = "Cadence" AND
windows with ID="xterm" to show up (such that the windowlist includes both such
entries), would that be possible?  I tried the obvious
windowlist (xterm* Cadence*)
windowlist (xterm* && Cadence*)
windowlist (xterm* || Cadence*)

Thanks very much.

Arya

No, conditions can have only one string argument at the moment.
There is a workaround, but it won't work if you're using other
modules that list windows (e.g. FvwmIconMan):

  Style * WindowListSkip
  Style xterm* WindowListHit
  Style Cadence* WindowListHit

The first line prevents any windows from showing up in the
window list, the second and the third make xterm and
Cadence appear again.  Now you can simply invoke the window
list with

  WindowList

The drawback is that these styles also apply to many
modules, e.g. FvwmWinList, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmIconMan, ...
I.e. other windows won't show up in these modules either.
Well, you could write a function that switches these styles
before the window list is invoked:

  AddToFunc NormalWLSkip
  + i Style * WindowListHit
  + i Style FvwmIconMan WindowListSkip
  + i Style FvwmButtons WindowListSkip

  AddToFunc SpecialWLSkip
  + i Style * WindowListSkip
  + i Style rxvt* WindowListHit
  + i Style Cadence* WindowListHit
  + i UpdateStyles

  AddToFunc MyWindowList
  + i SpecialWLSkip
  + i WindowList $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
  + i NormalWLSkip

Now invoke it with

  MyWindowList

Because I just coded the UpdateStyles command, this will not
work before the next beta release (2.3.19) or development snapshot
is available.

Is there a way to turn off ALL shading on window borders? I want completley
flat borders. no bevel, no ridge. Just a few pixels of a solid color.

This command was a poor attempt to fix jerky window movement,
but I don't think it ever did something useful anyway.  I was
unable to test it because the logic never kicked in, not even
on a slow machine with lots of work to do.  So I thought it's
better to remove the command before 2.4 was released and we
have to keep it for compatibility.  Was this command really
useful for you, Danny?  I can put it back into the code.

hi there...

in the process of migrating from twm to fvwm i have found that fvwm does
not seem to have a command equivalent to twm's f.unfocus function...

basically, f.unfocus will cause the window manager to take focus back
after an application grabs it... this is useful for some misbehaved
applications that grab focus but don't release it properly...

does fvwm have such function that i am just missing?

Must click twice into a window for it to get focus.
I use clicktofocus mode

My delete key (Sun) no longer works in Mailtool main window (cant delete msg)

Thanx


Also, is there a way to not let a window take hold of the entire desktop?
So that if there's a runaway window, i dont have to find another machine to
log in from to kill it?

(FVWM version 2.2.4)

I found the following post in the mailing list archives after having the
similar problems.  Firstly, a new window on an empty screen will appear at
(2,2) not (0,0).  Also, a Netscape window (say) that is the full
screen-size will also appear at (2,2) not (0,0).

I have found two things which seem to cause this in placement.c; I am
including a patch which solves the problem as far as I am concerned,
although I imagine it's not the "most correct" solution (but I don't have
time to look deeper into it).

Please tell me whether this is a bug or if I'm doing something wrong...

Thanks,
Ben.

Sigh, the function handling code is so complicated that you
can't do anything without breaking three other things.  I'll
commit a fix in a few minutes.

Both may be caused by the bug in complex functions.  Please
try again when my fix shows up in the snapshots.

Yes, the 'flat' option of the BorderStyle command should do this.
I don't have the proper syntax handy right now.

Ah, now that you rephrase that bug report I finally understand
what the problem is.  This is still happening with 2.3.19.

It's a bug.  The loops over the x and y coordinates are broken.
When the window finally found a proper position, the code adds
one pixel in x and y direction before placing it.  There's another
bug in the collision detection.  Windows are interpreted as
overlapping if they are directly adjacent.  This causes the two
pixel gap between windows.

Here is the proper fix for 2.2.4:

G'day,

I wish fvwm to exec an expect script. I have in my .fvwmrc:

Exec "router1" exec $HOME/map.exp router1

Where map.exp is the expect script and router1 is the argument to the script.
But this does not work. Changing the argument to exec above to just xterm 
works fine. Any ideas what's wrong in the syntax above? Or is running an 
interactive script like expect not supported?

Btw, the fvwm version is 1.24r.

Cheers,

Thanks -- that fixes the first problem (of a new window on an empty
screen). 

However, I am still having the problem with Netscape:  I have NS set up to
open its window at the maximum size for the screen.  So I would hope that
fvwm positions it from (0,0) so that it fills the screen exactly with no
edge-gaps.  But it actually appears at (2,2).  This still happens after
applying the patch you sent.  The patch I sent yesterday (where I subtract
2 from tmp_win->attr.x and y) seems to stop this problem, but as I said I
don't think it is the correct fix.

Thanks,
Ben.

I am trying to install a new version of fvwm on a Solaris 2.7 machine. (Ultra class). The current version is 2.0.42. I am trying to get 2.2.4 going but I am having problems.

When I put /usr/local/bin/fvwm into my .xinitrc file, fvwm will start up, but the system defaults do not show up (a logout button and the map with the desktops on it) nor is there anyway to log out. If I choose restart FVWM from the menu, then everything comes up ok and I can use it normally.  

I did just a plain ./configure on my system with no arguments.

I know this is sketchy but I don't know what type of information is needed. If you have questions please let me know.

What "system defaults" do you refer to?  Normally, FVWM configuration is
kept in your home directory, in ~/.fvwm2rc.  If you have some system
default file, it's very likely that the new FVWM isn't finding it, since
you installed it in a different place than the old FVWM.

If you have it in your ~/.fvwm2rc, then likely there is some kind of
error in that file.  Do you capture the error output from starting the X
server?  How do you usually invoke X and FVWM on this system?  Does it
boot into a graphical login, or do you log in on the console and then
use startx, or what?

We'll need to see that error messages FVWM generates (if any).

When you restart, you are undoubtedly using the old FVWM binary, not the
new one.  Pass a specific path to the Restart command, or put
/usr/local/bin on your PATH _before_ wherever the old FVWM was installed
so it's found first.

The old system.fvwm2rc file. Located in /usr/local/etc.

No ~/.fvwm2rc file.  I log on through CDE. and choose openwin for my manager (which looks at the ~/.xinitrc file to find what manager to run.

Does `which fvwm` return '/usr/local/bin/fvwm' ?

If not, the restart might be starting a different fvwm than the xinitrc, 
which in turn might be reading different config files.

I fixed my profile path and that seems to be working fine. Now it seems that the configuration file that was used in 2.0.42 does not exactly work in 2.2.4. 

In example:

I had a logout button that you could click on and it would ask for confirmation, if you clicked on yes, it logged you out (exited fvwm2). It also had a little map of the desks that you could click on and it would change virtual desktops. They work under 2.0.42, but not 2.2.4.

I have never really programmed the fvwm2rc file and don't really know how this is fixed, (whether they are modules, functions, etc). Does anyone know if these are built in functions that aren't working or some module or something?

OK.  Modify your .xinitrc so that it redirects stdout and stderr to a
file (maybe ~/.fvwm-errors or something) so you can see any messages
FVWM is generating.

This is called a "pager", and is implemented by the FvwmPager module.
It's possible (it's been so long I can't remember anymore) that 2.0.42
still had the builtin pager, which may be what the config is using.
That won't work anymore I think; you must use the FvwmPager module.

The file also has FvwmPager in it.

If I can get the error stuff show up it would help.

Again, I assume you mean ".../fvwm2" here.
                                  ^

What exactly does "puked on me" mean?  It's impossible to help without
proper descriptions of behavior.

I suspect the problem is that .xinitrc is a traditional Bourne shell
script.  The >& token is a C shell (bletch ptooey) feature... although
some Bourne-based shells, like bash, allow it too.

The equivalent to the above, in sh syntax, is:

  .../fvwm2 > fvwm-errors 2>&1

My apologies. What happens is that fvwm starts to load, shows xterms I start up, but the "background" which is supposed to be black just stays with the CDE login and never starts up correctly.

Hei

   If you are using expect and not expectk then the problem
is that there is no window for your script to "interact" in.

   You need to exec an xterm and tell the xterm to run your
expect script.  I am not sure of the exact syntax but it is
something along the lines of:

      Exec "router1" exec xterm -e $HOME/map.exp router1

I am not aware about a way to request unfocus from fvwm.
But if you really need this feature, here is a function that does this.
Note, NoWarp option of Focus only exists in 2.3.x series.

Been using Linux with fvwm2 for some weeks now and came up with this
list of questions:

1. Im using a filemenu item called "Files" with a list of files I use
often, each called with "emacs <filename>") - how can I send a file to
an existing emacs window, whitout opening a new emacs window?

2. How can I save a file (or shortcut) on the desktop (like Win95),
without using some kind of filemanager (like tkdesk).

3. Im using "Alt+Tab" to get the windowlist. Is it possible cycle
through the windowlist like Win95 or Enlightenment with flipping windows
on each "Tab"-hit - and recycle when "Shift" is down.

4. How can I - or what is the command to minimize and maximize all
windows back (like in Win95 with "Windows_Key + m" and "Shift +
Windows_Key + m") ?

5. How do I start an xterm that executes a "mount" followed by a "ls" ?

6. Lets say I have a filename in the clipboard. Is it possible to send
(pipe (?)) it to the menu, like
  "xv <take whatever is in the clipboard>" ?

7. Asclock is the only thing I want in FvwmButtons, but it get
"minimized" (only the upper left corner) - what's the exactly "Swallow
string" - and how do I remove edges around FvwmButtons.

8. Where does Linux associate files - or is it individual for each
program?

9. Where is the file with PATH?

10.Im in the xterm - how can I send a html-file to an existing Netscape
window, without opening a new one (same as quesion #1)?

11. How do I keep the normal cursor when in the "desktop-menu" - don't
like this left horizontal left arrow (default).

12. How can I make an "shutdown -h now" from the menu as "non-root" -
only using Fvwm2, and therefore don't have the "shutdown" posibility in
the default "window-manager login window".

13. Where can I add/remove buttons in the caption bar (system, close,
minimize and maximize) - ps know how to change the ButtonStyle.

14. How do I make a dynamic (recursive) "*.txt, *.c, *.cpp" filelist of
~/ in the menu - already tried the fvwm2/new-features example, but
couldn't make it work. Even better - lets say I found the file
(whatever) in the dynamic menu... and then press "Crtl+<something>" and
a menu-program-list pops up to choose from - is that possible? I mean
sometimes I want to use "emacs" other times "xjed" is better.

15. Is there a "drag & drop" utility/program/whatever that works all
over X Windows?

Thanks.

  that's more of a emacs question

  AFAIK you cannot put files on the desktop, the desktop in fvwm is not
a folder (like it is in win95).

  it is not possible but you can hit the number (or letter, if there's
too many items) to  focus on particular p[rogram (to switch to
particular program).

  I guess you can do that somehow (write a function?) but there's no
dire need to do it since you can send windows to back (so that they are
not on top but hidden behind other widows) and you can go to another
screen (or desktop) if you have too many windows on particular screen.

> 5. How do I start an xterm that executes a "mount" followed by a "ls" ?

  write a script:

#!/bin/sh
mount...
ls
read # or something so that the xterm does not close

  there are programs that output the current selection, on solaris
machine that I am using right now the program is xv_get_sel, use man -k
selection

  ?

  basically yes, but you can use the mime types for that purpose (debian
uses it in that way)

> 9. Where is the file with PATH?

  you set the PATH in the startup script for you shell, the name of the
file depends on shell you're using.

  it's not the same, it always depends on the target program. are you
talking about the URL in the xterm or actual file? the URL - just select
it and copy it into netscape's Location: field

  I think you can change it, check the man page

  don't know but I generally switch to virtual console (ctrl-alt-F1) and
use ctrl-alt-del to shutdown (you might have to change /etc/inittab,
because default is often reboot)

  see example .fvwmrc files, read the manual.

  lot of programs support the drag and drop protocol called... err... I
forgot, but I think even gnome and kde use it. the programs themselves
need to be aware of drag and drop, there's no separate utility for that.

I'm having a problem with the WebLogic
Admin console, one of the dialogue boxs
pops up blank and cannot be killed 
without killing the whole app.  The
tech at BEA said that she had never 
heard of the problem before and suggested
that it might be a problem with the 
Window Manager. 

Any opinions or insight?  

THx!

Use gnuserv.

 1- Get and install gnuserv package
 2- Add this to ~/.emacs :
     
  (setq gnuserv-frame (window-frame (selected-window)))
  (require 'gnuserv)
  (gnuserv-start)

 3- edit a file from the shell:

  $ gnuclient -q somefile.txt
