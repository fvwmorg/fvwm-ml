Is it possible to have inactive windows borderwidth 0, activewindows
borderwidth 3? Seems that borderwidth is tied to style, witch makes this
impossible. Is there a way to get this work?

I quote from the FAQ:

Some users have been getting odd startup problems, like total lockups.
I cannot reproduce this, and have no idea why.  Let me know if you see
this and find a way to consistently reproduce it.

It's very strange; I have fvwm2 compiled on an IRIX 6.2 box and an IRIX
6.4 box, and it works fine.  I have just compiled it on a separate network
of SGI workstations.  These run various versions from IRIX 5.3 to 6.3, so
I compiled the program under IRIX 5.3 so that I could have a common
executable.

It just locks up when I start the window manager; a screen grab seems to
happen, but nothing ever appears.  Having run IRIX's par program on it to
see what the process is trying to do, I get the following:

  157mS socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0) = 4
  157mS connect(4, <00 01 2f 74 6d 70 2f 2e 58 31 31 2d 75 6e 69 78>...,
19) OK
  157mS gethostname(atlantis.bioc.cam.ac.uk, 256) OK
  157mS fcntl(4, F_SETFD, 1) OK
  157mS access(/.Xauthority, R_OK) OK
  157mS open(/.Xauthority, O_RDONLY, 0666) = 5
  157mS fstat64(5, 0x7fff25c0) OK
  157mS ioctl(5, TCGETA, 0x7fff2568) errno = 25 (Inappropriate I/O control
operation)
  157mS read(5, <00 00 00 04 83 6f 24 1a 00 01 30 00 12 4d 49 54>...,
4096) = 40
 157mS lseek64(5, -283, SEEK_CUR) = 117
  157mS close(5) OK
  157mS writev(4, 0x7fff2908, 4) = 48
  158mS fcntl(4, F_SETFL, FNONBLOCK) OK
  158mS read(4, 0x7fff2b0c, 8) errno = 11 (Resource temporarily
unavailable)
  158mS select(5, IN:set=4 OUT:set=4, 0, 0, 0) = 1
  158mS read(4, <01 00 00 0b 00 00 00 9a>, 8) = 8
  159mS read(4, <00 00 17 71 01 00 00 00 00 3f ff ff 00 00 00 00>..., 616)
= 616
  159mS write(4, <37 00 00 05 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 34 00 00 00 08>..., 64)
= 64
  159mS read(4, 0x7fff2a2c, 32) errno = 11 (Resource temporarily
unavailable)

It then goes into a loop of thousands of these entries.

So it seems that it cannot read from the socket it connects to.  Any ideas
what the problem might be?  I can't copy the binary from the working
machines because the location of the modules and default configuration
file is different on this network. 

Thanks in advance.

Tim.

I can reproduce this with fvwm-2.0.46 under Linux (Red Hat Linux 4.2).
If a window is window-shaded, and you move it with the middle button in
FvwmPager's window, at the end of the drag, the window still appears
shaded, but with the top 15-20 pixels of the window displaying below
the title bar.  Bottom border is missing, and side borders look flat.
A subsequent window-shade operation un-window-shades, and a further
window-shade does a `normal' window-shade.

I'm using fvwm-2.0.46 on a linux 2.0 system. Everything works fine except the 
startup of fvwm. I'll set some default styles in my ~/.fvwm2rc which are used 
by all the windows.

However, when I first start fvwm then some windows do not get the default 
style (no, I don't have a special style entry for them). When I do a manual 
"Recpature Screen" (using the menu), then these "broken" windows get the 
correct style. It seems, that this happens to all windows, which open *before* 
fvwm initializes. The windows which open *after* fvwm has started get all 
their correct styles. But I'm not sure about this.

Has anyone a explanation?

Thanks,

I'm trying to build v2.0.46 on a Solaris 2.5.1 Sun Ultra1

I'm trying to do a "make install" and I get an error "Don''t know how to make 
target '../libs/libfvwm2.a'"

In the installations steps, I succeeded in doing the Imake with gcc v 2.7.2.3
now I'm trying to do the make install.  It installs OK in the libs and "." 
directories.  It does the "gcc" portion of the fvwm directory and makes all 
object files down to window.o.  I believe it is now doing the "gcc -o..." 
portion of the make file and is running into a problem with libfvwm2.a

any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!

        Would you settle for a small patch that will block the focus 
switch to a window that is not on the currently displayed desk/page? It'll
be fairly simple to do, I can't think of a good reason for not doing it
(rebuttals, anyone?), and I believe it will eliminate the most common
annoyance to the greatest number of people. I'll submit it in a few days. 
I don't think that more than this is practical in fvwm's current state 
(till after the Great Style Flag Rewrite).


        Now for the discussion part.... The original Usenet poster stated
the principle thus:

>  "Under no circumstances whatsoever should a windowing system allow
>  the keyboard focus to move other than as the result of explict user
>  action."

        While this sounds nice in principle - and I often have similar
feelings when confronted by the excesses of the in-your-face,
spoiled-child school of application programming - it's not so good in
actual practice. (I think the term "explicit user action" may be
open to a bit of fuzzy interpretation here.)

        I played around with the "ReallyStrictClickToFocus" idea on my
test system over the weekend, and the results were generally unsatisfying.
For keyboard oriented apps like editors and word processors, you usually
*do* want them to receive focus when they pop up a new window. With my 
"ReallyStrict" version, I still found myself typing into the wrong 
windows - just different wrong windows under different circumstances. 
Likewise, most of the time when you take an explicit action - like clicking
on "Find" in Netscape - that causes a transient to pop up, you tend to 
expect it to get focus without having to tell it so by clicking on it. I 
don't think anyone would be terribly happy if the "ReallyStrict" focus 
policy were forced on all applications.

        After the GSFR, I think it's reasonable to consider adding a
new style like "ClickToFocusAndIReallyMeanIt", which would allow you
selectively to apply a little more discipline to specific apps.

        Please realize, though, that neither my small patch nor the
proposed Strickly-Clicky mode would prevent ill-mannered apps from
explicitly grabbing focus themselves - but that's not what Netscape's
doing here.

Hi,

Old problem but I thought I would bounce it out again to see if there
was any "fresh blood" interested?



I am trying to introduce a small user group to the delights of fvwm
and several users have come back with a resizing problem.   We are using
Sun Sparc and Ultra-Sparcs with Solaris 2.5.1 and attempting to use
fvwm-2.0.43 instead of dtwm as manager.   Cntl+Mouse3 in a
/usr/openwin/bin
/xterm window gives a menu where you can reset the font for the current
xterm:

   VT Fonts
Default
Unreadable
Tiny
Small
:
:

In all bar the "Unreadable" case, the two window managers behave the
same;
the whole window is resized in proportion to the font and returns to 
normal when the Default is subsequently selected.

The "Unreadable" ( which is VERY SMALL ) behaves the same on dtwm but
fvwm, although returning to the default size and Font, is blank over the
"resized" width.

____________________     ______      ____________________

|abcdef ghijk lmn  |     |:::: |     |abc                |
|abcdef ghijk lmn  |  => -------  => |abc                |
|abcdef ghijk lmn  |                 |abc                |
|abcdef ghijk lmn  |                 |abc                |

|                  |                 |                   |
--------------------                 ---------------------

The users have numerous actively scrolling xterms at one time and tend
to use this "shrinking" procedure to allow them to get an overview of
these windows ( say 10 ) on the right hand side of the screen, while
working on other things.  When a task completes they can then "regain"
the window for review.

As I said, all the other fonts seem to behave ok except this very small
one.  Is this fvwm?  Is there a resource file option ( fontlist etc )
problem?

Any help or advice would be gratefully received.

Hello,

I'm a brand new Linux user, working with kernel 2.0.30.
I'm almost blind, so I need high contrast to work with a normal
display. Usually I try to change everything to a black background
and a white foreground.
The mainproblem with fvwm-2.0.45 is that my mousepointer on my xterm
is always black, so i cannot find it on my black background.
The second problem is to customize fvwm whereever it is possible in
my favorite white-on-black-look.

can you help me?

thank you, Michael

Could clicking "find" in netscrape be considered an "explicit user =

Subject: FVWM: FvwmWinList is shifting left on me
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


I just installed the newest (2.0.46) version of fvwm and overall I'm
pleased with it.  It fixes a couple of problems that I had before, but
it introduces a new bug.

I run the FvwmWinList module and the window list is not touching any of the
desktop borders (i.e. it's right in the middle of the screen).  Every time
an item is added or removed from the list (i.e. every time a new window is
created or a window is destroyed), the WinList shifts left one or two pixels.
After a while, the WinList is overlapping other windows.  Kind of annoying.

If there is a fix for this, could you tell me where to find it.

Thanks much

I had this problem too, and IIRC I fixed it by setting

*FvwmWinListGeometry +0+0

instead of something with a 1 in it.  All my FvwmWinList settings are
at http://www./vex.net/~buff/linux.html, and you can compare yours to
mine.

I've got 2.0.45 running on Ultrasparc2 with 2 screens.   I use CDE to
fire up but with fvwm2 as the window manager.   I do this by having a
.xinitrc which starts fvwm and I choose Openwin rather than CDE ( dtwm )
on the login window.

This works well on a single screen machine and allows me to toggle
between dtwm (yuch) and fvwm at login.   However,  I have found that
with a two screen system, a "restart" of fvwm on display0 will lock up
UNLESS I have performed at least one restart on display1.  As long as I
have done a restart on display1 it all behaves well.  It is as though
the system is not properly aware of the second screen until I have done
a restart on it.

Appart from this, the two screen system behaves well.


Anyone any ideas on what's going wrong?

I have similar problems (posted on 19 Sept); the problem is that the
amount of shift is related to borderwidth, and is not easy to
reproduce.  I have had the "greatest success" with some simple tk
activity, but have been unable to really locate the problem (though it
seems related to the "#define BW 1" in fvwm.h (2.0.45 and 2.0.46) and
the state of the XWindowChanges xwc object.

I have spent several hours in gdb and wish trying to track this down,
but get stopped trying to watch X events without freezing my machine.
(And then I get distracted by sleep, spouse, and bodily functions)

simplest demonstration (in Tcl/Tk):

$ wish
% wm geometry .
200x200+103+219
% wm geometry . +107+200
% wm geometry .
200x200+107+200
% winfo x .
106
% winfo y .
199
% wm geometry . +107+200
% winfo x .
200
% winfo x .
107
% exit
$

So where did the lost pixel go??  And why was it found after the
second
    wm geometry . +107+200
which did NOT move the stuff displayed on the screen!

Oops.

Forgot to mention that things move because many of the progs that I've
seen do the equivalent of the winfo x and winfo y to get current
coordinates while building a changes struct to pass to the wm.  Of
course, if wm has a different geometry, then a move "to the same
place" results in [at least] a one pixel shift left and up.  (Because
if they really were the same, the wm ignores the new location request,
but processes the rest of the Changes struct, which is what it is
supposed to do.)

This is most irritating in T.A.Phelps' tkman and Module FvwmIconMan
(which I would dearly like to change from

*FvwmIconMan*1*managergeometry		1x15-388-2

to

*FvwmIconMan*1*managergeometry		0x0-388-2

but it wanders)

This really got my interest.  This is not exactly something related
only to fvwm however.  The wish example can be taken further to other
window managers.  It seems the first time you specify the geometry the
geometry is given for the frame and then the actual window is slightly
moved for the borders.  If you open X with an xterm as your window 
manager (no borders), the geometry is the same the first time.

sun1464$ wish
% winfo x .
0
% winfo y .
0
% wm geometry .
200x200+0+0
% wm geometry . +107+200
% winfo x .
107
% winfo y .
200
% wm geometry .
200x200+107+200

I then started olwm in another xterm while leaving the wish up.

% winfo x .
112
% winfo y .
225
% wm geometry .
200x200+107+200
% wm geometry . +107+200
% winfo x .
107
% winfo y .
200
% wm geometry . +110+210
% winfo x .
115
% winfo y .
235
% wm geometry . +110+210
% winfo x .
110
% winfo y .
210
% wm geometry .
200x200+110+210

I haven't done any of the tracing through, so I couldn't tell you
how this should be coded.  I am guessing that the window manager
somehow refigures the geometry for the window and this is what is
used when you call the winfo x and winfo y, where the actual
geometry shown when you say wm geometry . gives that X thinks the
window is, and that should be what is parsed to create a structure
to use for changing the geometry (not the winfo x and y).

It is really interesting however.

ps. I did follow his example using fvwm first.  :)

Thanks for the followup, Walter.

This is correct.  And it is true that each window manager is supposed
to keep track of where each window is within its borders, as well as
where the borders are within the parent window, and report the
appropriate ones to the children.

So far, though, fvwm is the only one I have found where there are
three distinct results that I can get.  (my previous examples did not
show the third result; that is at home awaiting further
hammer-and-tong-ing).  What I see is (relative to the location which I
specify) -1 pixel in the x and y directions, -borderwidth pixels in
the x direction and -(titlebarheight+borderwidth) in the y direction,
or the "correct" (i.e. +/- 0 pixels) number.

Donald.

Try FvwmIconMan, which doesn't have the bug and is much better IMHO.

Two ideas: 1. get a new guru, and 2. send us a clue.  following the

I have a idea.

Tell us what error messages you are getting.

Tell us what the symptoms of the problem are.

Far as I know, we're not Psychic.

Sometime in the late 1900s it was said:

[Chomp]

PG> As I said, all the other fonts seem to behave ok except this very small

PG> problem?

   I just tried this and I am not able to reproduce this condition.
   I am currently using fvwm-2.0.46 on Linux 2.0.0.

   My first guess would be *if* this problem is a fvwm problem it may have
   been addressed in a later version.  You might want to install a later
   version of fvwm and see if you can reproduce the same effect.

   Good luck,

Patrick Keshishian ...

I tried this on Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) with 2.0.46, and had no problem.

It is unlikely to be a font problem; I am not sure, in fact, how the window
manager can have any effect on this. Does the affected (blank) area of the
xterm window refresh if you do an 'xrefresh'?

Uhmz...it appears Linux is looking for .fvwmrc instead of .fvwm2rc
In this case, you apparently forgot to tell linux that it should run version 2 instead of 1.
Are you sure the line in your X startup file is correct ?
(on my machine, the file is called .login or .xsession)

Hope this helps...

I know from own experience that fvwm is _very_ sensitive when it comes to path stuff: 
I can run binaries and use icons from all over other people's accounts (if the files are readable
for me, of course), but I can use my _own_ binaries/icons if and only if they're in my home dir.
When I put them into a subdirectory, they don't work anymore, even though I'm absolutely sure
I changed the paths (anybody can help me on this, by the way ?).

I just did some more testing of this; the problem is present in 2.0.41,
2.0.43 and 2.0.45 but not in 2.0.46. I haven't looked to see if there is a
fix specifically targeted at this problem in 2.0.46, though.

Hi all,

On Pungenday, the 16th day of The Aftermath in the YOLD 3163 it was said:

   Hmm.. thinking about this and discussing it with a friend of mine
   I am more confused as how this could've been a bug in fvwm or
   more generally a wm problem.

   Could any of your more experienced fvwm user/coders explain how
   this was related to a problem in fvwm and how it was fixed?

   Thanks in advanced!

It was a problem in the way fvwm was handling some X11 events that are
generated to go with this action.

Patrick>    Could any of your more experienced fvwm user/coders explain how
Patrick>    this was related to a problem in fvwm and how it was fixed?

When you resize an xterm smaller width wise, it essentially cuts off
anything that goes off the right edge.  This is central to the problem.

What was happening is that fvwm sees a PropertyNotify event telling of
the new size that the XTerm needs to be when changing fonts like that,
but it happens before the resize actually takes place.  There was some
code added to fvwm2 (at some point before I took over) that wasn't in
fvwm 1.xx that tried to set up the frame at that point, which was too
soon and fvwm essentially was making the XTerm refresh at the smaller
size at which point it changed the font, cutting off any chars that
ended up going off the right edge.  Then the actual event that causes
fvwm to do the resize occured, making the XTerm the correct size for
the new font, but now all the stuff that got cut off was lost.

Hope that makes sense, I'm not quite awake yet this morning...

 Er, well...I've never had NetScrape offer to click it all by itself.

We have encountered a strange problem with fvwm 1.24 on Solaris 2.4
systems.  Every month (or so, haven't narrowed down the frequency) all
of the systems in our facility (and even remotely) that have the fvwm
window manager hang (well, sort of...).  The mouse is still active,
however, you cannot get focus on any of the windows (cursor block
remains empty even when the mouse is in the window).  You can still type
in whatever window was active at the time of the hang.  The only way to
fix the problem is to restart the window manager.  The last day it
happened was October 8th, 1997.  We can actually reproduce the problem
by setting the date on any workstation back to Oct. 8th.  Strange, huh?

Anyone experience a similar issue....?

Thanks,

I used to see this with fvwm1 when I would set the system clock backwards.
It would only be effective until the clock wound back to where it started.
I found this while playing with a time-setting process learning how to
keep my Linux box sync'd with certain other computers.  It had slipped a
significant number of minutes ahead of the real world.  I probably 
wouldn't have noticed only a second or two of delay.  The first time I hit
it, I restarted.  If you are setting the clock back to Oct 8 while fvwm1
is running, you might get the same effect but lasting for a month.  I
guess it is possible on other OS's such as Solaris, that the freeze might
never time out.

All this is prelude to asking you whether the freeze-ups are somehow
correlated to NTP or other time-synchronizing procedures you might have
active on all of your machines?  One of my colleagues here has observed
what he feels is unsatisfactorily smooth clock manipulations from xntpd on
his Linux setup.  Winding the clock backwards might be your trigger event.
Hope this helps....

Do you, by any chance, periodically synchronize the time on your
workstations? The symptoms you describe can occur if the system's date and
time move _backwards_.  This has been fixed in one of the more recent
versions of 2.x.

Huh???  You need to give us a bit more detail than that.

Could it be that your X-server is mis-configured and falls back to
320x200 mode?

You can capture the messages from your startx command in a file.  
If your shell is bash, try: 

startx > start.log 2>&1

Then read what's in ``start.log'', maybe that will give you a more
accurate idea of what's going on.  If it turns out that your X server
config is the problem, you will want to read the relevant READMEs and
FAQs.  For X server problems you would also best post questions in
``comp.os.linux.x'' or ``comp.windows.x''.  

Fvwm is only a window manager, it does not set your screen size.

Good luck

X-Mailer: VM 6.22 under 19.15 XEmacs Lucid
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I'm trying to get FvwmButtons to handle xbiff running on four
machines.  I have made small shaped icons and would like it to appear
like this:

    [X] Machine1
    [X] Machine2
    [X] Machine3
    [X] Machine4

where [X] is the swallowed xbiff.

When the xbiff gets swallowed, it is centered in its button and the
title disappears.  If I don't use Title (Side), then the title
correctly moves down under the xbiff when it is swallowed.

This part of my .fvwm2rc illustrates some things that I've tried.  In
this mail there is an extra newline before each "'Exec".

*FvwmButtonsColumns 1
*FvwmButtons (Size 96 32, Title COMPO, Swallow (NoHints) Compo
    'Exec remsh compo xbiff -name Compo -display $DISPLAY &')
*FvwmButtons (Title (Side Left) MANDY, Swallow (Hints) Mandy
    'Exec remsh mandy xbiff -name Mandy -display $DISPLAY &')
*FvwmButtons (Title (Right Side) MISS, Swallow (NoHints) Miss
    'Exec remsh miss xbiff -name Miss -display $DISPLAY &')
*FvwmButtons (Title (Side) NEMO, Swallow (NoHints) Nemo
    'Exec remsh nemo xbiff -name Nemo -display $DISPLAY &')

Version is FvwmButtons.c v2.0.41-plural-Z-alpha as distributed with
fvwm 2.0.46.

If the mailboxes could be NFS-mounted on one machine you could use xbuffy to 
monitor all four.  It lets you specify the label and the command to read the 
email in a .xbuffyrc file.

Cheers,
Tim.

I did try xbuffy but /var tends to be local to a machine, not exported
in the machines I'm trying to monitor.  Does anyone know of a mail
indicator that can execute programs rather than monitor files to look
after multiple mailboxes?

I would also like something like this,where I swallow IconMan and use
it for a task bar. I can get FvwmButtons to swallow it, but the only
thing my clicks to is iconify stuff. Here are my FvwmIconMan setup
scripts and the swallow command:

 *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers            1
    *FvwmIconMan*background             Black
    *FvwmIconMan*foreground             Green
    *FvwmIconMan*drawicons              true
    *FvwmIconMan*format                 "%t"

			sendcommand "Iconify -1"
    *FvwmIconMan*action                 Mouse 	2 N sendcommand "Iconify"

This looks superfically like the quoted stuff above, but it doesn't work for
me.

Same here.

*FvwmButtons(2x3, Padding 0 0, Swallow "FvwmIconMan" "FvwmIconMan")

In the console I get:
 
FvwmIconMan: Bad action: sendcommand Focus, sendcommand "Iconify -1"
FvwmIconMan: Offending line: *FvwmIconMan*action                 Mouse 	1 N sendcommand Focus, sendcommand "

FvwmIconMan: Offending line: *FvwmIconMan*action                 Mouse 	2 N sendcommand Iconify

Any ideas what could be going wrong? Fvwm2.0.45 on an UltraSparc running
Solaris 2.5.1.

	Well, that's I have made a patch to improve (IMHO) the look
of fvwm2 menus, if anyone is interested I will uuencode it and post 
it to the list for you to test.
	The bad point about this patch is that it requires hicolor
or better displays, if you don't have one of this don't try it, it 
would get almost your entire colormap!

This looks like a version mismatch for FvwmIconMan. You're using the new
syntax for actions, and those error messages sound like you're trying to give
them to an older version of FvwmIconMan. 

I tried out your lines on my copy, and it works fine. You might change that
action for mouse button 1 to send the iconify -1 first and then the focus
though if your intent is to have the uniconified window receive the focus.

Hmm, odd, I don't think this is it, since the only copy of fvwm, either
1 or 2, on this system is the one I installed, so there shouldn't be old
copies lying around. But I'm about to do a reinstall with fvwm-2.0.46, so
we'll see if that helps.

Is there anyway to check the version of a module?

What is that ? Xlock ???

Perhaps you could first try mapping another command to this key, for example

Key Pause A C FvwmBanner

And tell us what happens then.

This might tell us wether there's something wrong with XLock or with mapping the pause key.

       xlock  -  Locks  the  local  X display until a password is

its a great 'screensaver'-pack :)

nothing :(
the error (probs with &) wasn't from this action.. it was something
another 
("I" + module + & != good)

i have tested with the A-ke.. it works.. only Pause don't work in
FVWM2.. in all another apps (Tcl/tk or so) it works fine..

I just tried the above example, and it worked just fine for me (at
work under AIX).  If you entered it in FvwmTalk, you'll need to do a
Recapture to get it to take effect.

I also tried:

Key Escape A C Module FvwmBanner

and that worked fine for me here too.

Well, it turns out that indeed the version of FvwmIconMan I had was
incompatible with the version of fvwm I'm running. Looks like a lot
of the time the generic fvwm2 distribution ships with a version of
FvwmIconMan made for the version or two before. So I was running
.9 which was meant for fvwm-2.0.43 or so. I recompiled it from the
fvwm-2.0.46 distribution (which says it is for 2.0.45) and now the
commands work.

What I haven't done is install fvwm-2.0.46. Once I do so (I'm going to
add the startsonpage patch), can I expect FvwmIconMan to break again?

xev says that the key PAUSE generate
...
keycode 110 (keysym 0xff13, Pause)
...


but CTRL+PAUSE generate 
...
(keysym 0xffe3, Control_L)
...
(keysym 0x0, NoSymbol)
...

SO ctrl+pause won't work...

Key     Pause   A       A       exec xlock -nolock -mode dclock
Key     Pause   A       SM      exec xlock -mode dclock

This works fine, but

Key     Pause   A       C       exec xlock -nolock -mode dclock

don't work. Why?

The only problem I see is that you don't actually use the word file 
so you want:

+	"I" Module FvwmButtons /root/.fvwm2b_inet

When FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp are used, do they process the entire .fvwm2rc
file, or can they be used to process only a function, such as
InitFunction? Here's what I want to do. My home directory is
cross-mounted to several boxes, on of which is my "home" box. When I log
into another box, its for some specialized purposes. I'd like to have a
"regular" InitFunction for when I log into my home box, and be able to
have different, specialized InitFunctions based on my hostname.

Now that you have reminded me the name of the tool xev:  On the sun
keyboard it is as so:

PAUSE:

KeyPress event ...   keycode 28 (keysym 0xffd2, F21)

and

CTRL + PAUSE:

 keycode 83 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L)
 keycode 28 (keysym 0xffd2, F21)

So it should work for me, if I give it a try.  I think xlock is
a good choice for the key.  Thanks.  Sorry it won't help anyone
not on a Sun, but I was happy to learn.

Nope, you need to get your XFree86 setup adjusted.  fvwm just handles
windows; it does not set up those aspects of your X display.  Sorry I
can't tell you much else -- XFree86 has about a thousand README - type
files.  Dig around in there to find out how to adjust your XF86Config.

Drew,

You can definitely do this.  Say you have four fvwm2 setup files: 
.fvwm2rc-common, .fvwm2rc-init-home, .fvwm2rc-init-work, and .fvwm2rc-M4.
You would start fvwm2 like this in your .xinitrc (or maybe .Xclients or
.xsession):

    exec fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 ~/.fvwm2rc-M4 > ~/.fvwm2-errors 2>&1

Now here's what .fvwm2rc-M4 would look something like, if your home
machine's hostname were "goocher":

    changequote(<<, >>)

    define(<<HOME>>, patsubst(HOME, <<`>>, <<>>))
    define(<<HOME>>, patsubst(HOME, <<'>>, <<>>))

    include(HOME/.fvwm2rc-common)
    define(<<INITFILE>>, ifelse(esyscmd(hostname), <<goocher>>,
           HOME/.fvwm2rc-init-home, HOME/.fvwm2rc-init-work))
    include(INITFILE)

Naturally, .fvwm2rc-init-home and .fvwm2rc-init-work would just look
something like

AddToFunc InitFunction
+			"I" Module FvwmButtons
+			"I" Module FvwmAuto 750
+			"I" Exec nxterm

Try that.  If you have problems, look in ~/.fvwm2-errors, and use the
emacs info documentation on M4 -- I don't know if my M4 code is quite
right.

If you're maximizing an xterm or similar window (rxvt, xjed, &c.) you
can easily get this sort of behavior, since xterms contrain their size
to an integral multiple of their character cell size.  If you try a
`Maximize 100 100' on an xterm, you may find that it doesn't fill the
full height of the viewport either.

Some games do use the pause key to suspend the game (MAelstrom, Doom)... I
know I've gotten older fvwm2 configurations to work with CTRL+ALT+PAUSE or
some variation of that... However, this didn't seem to work across all
platforms....

Just run FvwmIconMan and it will print out an error message like:

*FvwmIconMan Version 1.0 should only be executed by fvwm!

fvwm2.0.46 should have the latest version. I wouldn't expect it to break.

I'm running fvwm2 on a DEC 3000 with Digital Unix 4 and the Xdec Xserver
and two physical displays.

I would like to configure the displays seperately.  I realize that this
means using m4 of cpp preprocessing, but I haven't found a way to use
either to configure the displays seperately.  I've tried making use of
my DISPLAY environment variable by passing it into the pre processor at
the command line, but this gives me display 0 on both screens.  Could
somebody give me an example of how to config the two screens
seperately?  I'd prefer to use the CPP partly because I don't know m4
and mostly because FvwmM4 generates memory faults and craps out on my
system (an error that I don't feel like spending great deals of time
tracking down and debugging)

Thanks,
Matt

Sorry I don't have a `cpp' example (I like some of the benefits of m4 :-),
but the key is the SCREEN setting that is defined. Here is an example
from my somewhat extensive .fvwm2rc that I designed for our "standard
X environment" here at ANS:

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec ROOT_BACKGROUND_CMD &
m4_ifdef(`AUTORAISE_DELAY',`
+ "I" Module FvwmAuto AUTORAISE_DELAY
')
m4_ifelse(SCREEN,`0',`
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons
m4_ifdef(`NO_ICON_MANAGER',,`
+ "I" Module FvwmIconMan
')
',SCREEN,`1',`
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons Fvwm_Buttons1
m4_ifdef(`NO_ICON_MANAGER',,`
+ "I" Module FvwmIconMan
')
',`
# Screen 2
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons Fvwm_Buttons2
m4_ifdef(`NO_ICON_MANAGER',,`
+ "I" Module FvwmIconMan
')
')

Hopefully this provides an example of how to do what you want. Notice
the argument to FvwmButtons for the other screens (so you can have 
different button bars on each screen).

Eddy

got a problem with my (/usr/openwin/bin) xterms.  They won't
/usr/openwin/bin/resize.  For example, in an xterm,

fxl fish ~ >resize
resize:  can't open terminal /dev/tty

And not being able to open the tty, also means I can't start screen (from my
xterm, so I'm using yucky ol' cmdtool).

I've tried other window managers (like olwm and CDE) and they're fine. (btw
I'm running without dtlogin).
I've also tried alternate xterms (the one from patch 105464-01) and there
is no difference.  I've rebuilt gcc for 2.6 (and it's okay).
The permissions on /dev/tty are the same using either window manager, so I
_think_ the problem is in fvwm2.  Where can I start looking for it?  If I
can't get this fixed, I won't be able to offer fvwm2 to my users :(


help!

Hi everybody!

I have a problem with FVWM2 that I don't have with other window 
managers such as FVWM, Afterstep, twm, Exceed and HP X-Terminals.

I run a commercial application (HP Design and Drafting System for 
Cabling, DDS-C) remotely and display it on my Linux-box. At some 
point in the application a have a list from which I can choose 
different components. If I click with the right mouse button a 
component name, a window opens which displays some technical info 
about the component and the graphical symbols associated with the 
component. The problem is that with FVMW2 this windows is really huge
(1596x6384 pixels) when it is supposed to be something like 533x399 
pixels (533*3=1599, 399*16=6384).

I have really no clue what the problem is ;< I have read the FAQ, TODO,
BUGS, searched the www-site and also looked at the man-page but found 
no indication of a similar behaviour. This is why I'm writing to this 
mailing list.

I can guarantee the reproduction of this bug. Unfortunately not too 
many people have access to DDS-C so I don't know how anybody else 
could repeat it. But I'll be happy to dig up more information if 
someone tells me how.

Here's what I came up with:
- Fvwm Version 2.0.45 compiled on May  8 1997 (from debian-release 1.3
  precompiled binary)
- personal configurationfiles make no difference
- some library info:
  /lib/ld-linux.so.1, libXpm.so.4, libXext.so.6, libX11.so.6, libc.so.5
- I'm running Linux 2.0.30 with AcceleratedX v.3.1

I guess that's all... I can always go back to FVWM1 but I already have
started to enjoy the more advanced features of FVWM2 :)

Thanks in advance,

Jaakko Puurunen

Question about FVWM capabilities on Unix station :



-I have the following requirement from a customer :

-My application displays a large window on the top of the screen. This 
window haves its width equal to the screen width and the height corresponding 
to 20% of the screen height. It gives in real time operational information 
on system to the user, so this window cannot be moved by him, and no windows 
from other applications can overlap it or can be overlapped by it.

-In other words, the screen must have two zones, the first zone is
reserved 
for the large window of my application, this window cannot be moved and the 
second zone is reserved for the other application windows which can be moved 
but not into the first zone.

-I intend to use the FVWM window manager (version 2.0.41) but I think 
this functionnality does not exist in this version, so I have to implement
modifications to satisfy this requirement. 

-I would be grateful if you can give me some indication on how introduce
this functionnality in the code of Fvwm or is there any further version which 
implement it.

                       Thanks a lot for anybody who can help me.

This would be quite handy in other contexts too.  For example, I can make 
FvwmButtons stay on top, and things, but it would be quite cool to have other 
windows refuse to pop up over it, and to have maximising other windows take 
account of it, and that kind of thing.  Similarly for FvwmTaskBar, once it 
works properly.

I will be guilty of interpretation and speculation in the following, but I
suspect that Monsieur Magneron's NEEDS could be provided by a modification
to SmartPlacement.  This would allow a prohibition of a window being
placed over his protected windows, although the user would still be able
to move a window over this area.  This could be mediated by style settings
like "SmartPlacementNeverCovers", perhaps coupled with a
"StaysOnTopAbsolutely" flag or degree options to the current StaysOnTop. 
Of course, how to implement this last part is a problem. What would one do
with two conflicting windows but to give priority to the earlier created
one?  And then at restarts, which would end up with the priority?

 I just installed fvwm-2.0.46 on a SunOs 4.1.3 OS and I'm trying to do a remote
login (rlogin) in to other machines on the same network. I have the following
command lines in my .fvwm2rc file;

>AddToMenu Remote-Logins "bradford" Exec rlogin -l aa bradford &
>"shanghai" Exec rsh shanghai rxvt -display $HOSTDISPLAY &
>+"wakefield" Exec rsh wakefield rxvt -display $HOSTDISPLAY &

Where bradford, shanghai and wakefield are the names of the machines i intend to 
log on to. The whole thing doesn't work. I'm aware I have to set the environment
variables rightly, but how do I do that? Our system doesn't recognise rxvt.

How can I adjust my .fvwm2rc file so that such a remote login in becomes possible?
What troubles me is the fact that even if I do a remote login  to another
maschine "manually", I am not able to use the X11-resources on that remote maschine.
This seems to be a problem peculiar to fvwm. With other window managers on our
system, I can rlogin into another maschine, change the display variables and I'll
be able to use X11 programs on the remote maschine. Is this also possible with
fvwm2, if so how?

I will highly appreciate any contributions which might lead to the solution of
this problem.

Cheers,
Ashu

What happens when you try this while running fvwm2?  i.e., if you have an 
xterm running somewhere, you do an rlogin, set DISPLAY, and run an X program?

I use a line like this (csh is the default shell on the remote side):
(broken onto two lines for viewing)

+   "X-TERM"   Exec exec rsh <remotehost> \
		setenv PATH $PATH':/usr/bin/X11'";" "xterm"

It works well.  rsh doesn't get the env variables like PATH set properly.
This is generally stated in the appropriate man page.

My guess is that acutally he is using a program that automatically
does an xhost + or something and therefore allows the windows to 
display.  Aa, you need to make sure you have permission to write to
your display if you want to remotely execute programs that use the
display.  There are two different ways to do this, and they are somewhat
exclusive.  If you use xauthority, then each machine you have the same
home directory on (NFS mounted) you will be able to use the display
without doing any other commands (unless you have used xhost).  xhost
allows you to specify which hosts are allowed to use the display.  This
means anyone on the host can use it and that you can't if you haven't 
given the remote host permission.

   How about this:

      A new module by which you can indicate an area on your screen
      by dragging your mouse pointer (the area being indicated by a
      rubber.band of course) and that area could be considered a "Zone".
      The first window put in that zone will not be overlapped
      or be interfered with until the "Zone" is inactivated using the
      same module (different mouse button click on the "Zone" maybe?)

      Also one could use the module to pick/choose an already existing
      window to be considered as being in a "Zone"

      Do I make sense? :)  Prolly not... but maybe.

      I'm thinking this procedure:

         1.  Invoke module.
         2.  a. Use mouse button one (1) to rubber.band a "Zone".
                Next open new window/drag existing window in "Zone".
             b. Use mouse button two (2) to choose/select an existing
                window to be in a "Zone" (area which it occupies).
         3.  Use mouse button three (3) to inactivate an already
             existing "Zone".

Patrick ...

P.S.  Shall it be called the ZoneModule? ;)

hi,

here (linux/X11) it was the whole time so that i could scroll when i
clicked the apps in the titlebar with them from one screen to the
another 
(i use 2x4 screens/no desks) but now i can't scroll and i don't know why
:((
it was so that i coul'd only change with apps the screen and i could't
move the mouse from one screen to the another..
EdgeScroll was 0 0.. when i change to 100 100 than i can move the apps
by moving-with-the-mouse from one screen to the another but so i can
change 
with the mouse to :((

what's wrong here ? i haven't changed anything.. i use only the
animated-shade patch now.. 

sorry for my bad englisch, but i hop that someone know what i mean..

I like fvwm style better than mwm, but i just have to use mwm style
because
i hate fvwm style of overlapping the next submenu. How do i have to
modify the source to have fvwm style but mwm style open of a new
submenu?

Well, here it is, the patch is made against fvwm-2.0.46, and adds
some files, if it doesn't work post a note and I would repost it
again, I was in a hurry, and have little time to test it.


The structure of the MenuStyle command has changed, now it admits
next (in the same position that mwm or fvwm) and then it needs more 
parameters

	Here are some examples

	
	MenuStyle .... next NWSE Black White 20 WEW MidnightBlue White 20
			     |    |	|     |
		gradient style    |	|     |
			start color	|     |
			        end color     |
				     # of steps

						The same for title style
	MenuStyle .... next NSN  Red Maroon  20 None
	

	The possible GradientStyle are:
	  -> None   (No gradient. It doesn't need any more parameters)
	  -> NWSE   (NorthWest to SouthEast)
	  -> NS	    (North to South)
          -> NSN    (North - South - Norht )
          -> WE	    (West to East)
          -> WEW    (West - East - Weast )

   
    Questions are welcome.

Sorry if this is in the manual, but I couldn't find it.  Is there a way to
turn off xforms' use of backing store?  It seems that the default is
WhenMapped, I'd like to change it to NotUsefull for my app. 

Actually, what I really want to do is have xforms redraw its windows when I
use fvwm's refresh command.  I've noticed that all the windows with backing
store disabled will redraw themselves, but the xforms windows won't.  I'm
guessing that xforms is relying on backing store to do the re-draw, which
isn't working for my app.

   36. Made window move paging match Edgescroll values instead of
           always doing full screens (should this be an option?)

I have some additional information concerning the huge window and FVWM2.

If I start my X-session with FVWM2, restarting with any other
window manager results with the same problem; i.e. afterstep or twm
also display the window incorrectly.

On the other hand, if I start with afterstep, restart with twm,
everything goes fine but switching to FVWM2 results with the problem
again.

Here's the relevant part of the problem, I believe:

user specified size: 533 by 399 (by xprop)
-geometry 1596x6384+0+768 (by xwininfo)

It appears that the user specified size is somehow overridden by FVWM2.

Here's a chance for you gurus out there to make a FVWM2-newbie happy :)

Thanks in advance,

Jaakko Puurunen

Hi there.

In the fvwmrc file I took over from the local fvwm guru, it reads:

Key Left  A SCM CursorMove -1 0
Key Right A SCM CursorMove +1 +0
Key Up    A SCM CursorMove +0   -1
Key Down  A SCM CursorMove +0   +1

Really nice.
So I can move the cursor around without using a mouse.
But now, how can I map a mouse-click to a keystroke ?
(so, something like "Key Enter A SCM LeftMouseClick")

Thanks.

I've made a simple enhancement to FvwmCascade.
The idea is to have the windows constraints to the screen
without resizing them. So if the window slip out of the screen just
begin again in the top or the left (never tryed with flag -desk).
This should be usefull if you have many (>15) windows in one screen.

we now have two more options:
 -mcols : multiple columns
 -mlins : multiple lines

(maybe the name of the options can be changed)

Hope it's usefull. Hope this is the wright way to do these things.

	Hi. I would like to set up a Pager the size of a
full screen that would only display on that screen and
have a sticky button bar with one of the buttons being a
transfer to the screen with the Pager.
	I first thought that the way to do this was have
a second pager swallowed in one of the buttons. But I'm
not interested in the whole pager grid in the case of the
second Pager swallowed in the button but only the part of
it that transfers control to the desktop with the full
screen pager.
	I hope i said that clearly! 
	Is there a better way to make a button that transfers
to only one specific desktop in the 'grid'?

thank you in advance.

I used to get similar error messages when starting up FvwmButtons,
except with me it happened every time. I finally traced my problem to
the version of libXpm that I was using, it was libXpm-4.7. When I
replaced this version of libXpm with the earlier 4.6 version,
FvwmButtons worked fine, and I never had any mor eproblems with it.

You can, of course, check the version of libXpm that your FvwmButtons is
using by "ldd FvwmButtons"

Hope this helps.

This patch would make possible to configure fvwm2 menus in
with nextish look. Read the man page (command MenuStyle for
a not too much detailed description of the new options).

  If you are not too fond of reading man pages, you can try
the following MenuStyle entry in your .fvwm2rc:

MenuStyle  Black Gray41 Blue -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-*-120-120-*-*-iso8859-1 \
           next NWSE Gray31 LightGray 20 WEW MidnightBlue White 20

that make menus resemble that of AfterStep.

I'm currently working in improve the efficiency (now it uses different functions
and command style for Menus and for Title bars) so you can also use Pixmaps for
Menus background (and improve a little the so nice TitleBar style).

Subject: Re: FVWM: How to mouse click from keyboard? 

If you have the X Keyboard (XKB) Extension, you can enable mouse keys,
which makes it possible to generate mouse motion and button events using
the keyboard.   Events generated by MouseKeys are completely transparent --
they will work with any application that connects to a server that has
the X Keyboard Extension, regardless of whether the application itself
uses XKB.

XKB is enabled by default in X11R6.1.   XFree86 3.1.2D is based on R6.1
and has the X Keyboard Extension.   If you are using an earlier release
of X or XFree86, you won't have XKB and the following instructions will
not work:

You might also have to turn off server num lock for this to work.  I 
haven't tried and don't know for certain.

First, set up the Num Lock key so that Shift+Num_Lock toggles mouse keys:

xmodmap -e "keysym Num_lock = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys"

Now press "Shift+Num_Lock" to enable MouseKeys.  When MouseKeys are on:
o)   The keypad arrow keys move the pointer
o)   The keypad '5' key behaves like the 'default' pointer button
o)   The keypad '0' key locks the default pointer button (for easy dragging)
o)   The keypad '.' key unlock the default pointer button (to release a drag)
o)   The keypad '+' key double-clicks the default pointer button.
o)   The keypad '/' key sets the 'default' button to Button1
o)   The keypad '*' key sets the default button to Button2
o)   The keypad '-' key sets the default button to Button3

This is the default configuration.  If, for some reason, this doesn't
meet your needs, drop me a message.    This stuff is nearly infinitely
configurable if you're patient (this _is_ the X Window System after 
all:-).

A bit of a freaky idea, but it's your choice :-)

Ehmz...try something like starting the Pager in the Init function on a certain screen

AddToFunc InitFunc
...blabla...your own stuff...
+ "I" Desk 0 0 (or whatever other desk - if necessary)
+ "I" GotoPage 0 0 (or whereever you want your pager)
+ "I" FvwmPager

Don't Forget to add
FvwmPagerGeometry ... (whatever is needed to provide a full-screen)

And then, Make a button like this (on the sticky buttonbar)

*FvwmButtons (1x1, Title Pager, Icon blabla.xpm, Action "GotoPage 0 0")

I didn't test it, but the idea should be right.

Not bad or you could do something like 
 Next [FvwmPager*] Iconify -1
	so your not locked into having the pager in a specific location.
plus that won't work if it is on a different desk
I map something like that to the help button to get me to my tkman 
with the added line
Next [Man*] WarpToWindow 32 9
  so my cursor will actually be somewhere useful in the window

Can anybody answer this:  if you have a 2-button mouse and do not have
Emulate3Buttons set in XF86Config, does fvwm2 interpret your buttons as
being #1 and #3, or #1 and #2?

Given  the multipliers that  the  window is  off by,  I  would have to
suspect the "aspect ratios".  The function in fvwm2 that handles these
hints is in fvwm/resize.c in function "ConstrainSize".  I suggest that
you remove the  code that starts with the  comment "Third, adjust  for
aspect ratio" and see if you still have the problem.

Remove the code up until the comment "Fourth, account for border width
and title height".

Let us know the result.

	My previous mailing about a full screen pager and
a 'goto' button was confusing to myself among others.
	I would like to state a more simple question.

	I have one monitor which I understand to be 'Desk:0'.
My .fvwm2rc states 'DeskTopSize 4x4'. So there 16 desktops are
allocated. Now I want to have a button in the button bar that
will cause a jump to a specific one of those 16 desktops.
	I believe that the "GotoPage" call is for transferring
to Desk:1 or 2 or 3, but *not* within Desk:0. Either that or I
just dont know how to use it correctly. 
	Thanks in advance for any help!

Hey there folks.  Just thought you might like to add another successful
compilation to your list of possibilities.

host:   Sun SparcStation IPX  running S/Linux (RedHat)
problems:  RedHat didn't install header files properly.  It was necessary
           to create the symlinks from /usr/include into the proper
           directories in the kernel source-tree.  Note: asm should be a
           link to asm-sparc, not asm-i386 as it is in the kernel README
           (guess they haven't gotten to the esoteric bits that need
           editing)

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.0.46 compiled on Nov 18 1997 at 15:41:54

Linux fluke 2.0.30 #1 Mon Nov 17 18:42:11 EST 1997 sparc unkown



PS - time to get a new framebuffer... I need more colors  =)

	Sorry, (again) I will repost the fvwm2.man diffs but for now it's
as easy as:

	MenuStyle .... next menu_style title_style

where:
	.... is the normal MenuStyle command (colors, fonts, etc)

	menu_style and title style are Style Definitions of the form:

	gradient_style start_color end_color #_of_steps

with gradient_style one of NWSE, NS, NSN, WE, WEW

if you put  None  as gradient_style you don't need to specify any more
parameters ( example: MenuStyle ... next None None )
	

PS: Sorry again.

I've spent some time working on a project I've decided to call
PerlMenu. Basically, it allows you to browse your filesystem through
dynamically built fvwm menus. I wrote in perl5 but didn't use the
fvwmperl module do modularize PerlMenu. So you won't actually need it
if you haven't gotten it yet.

Right now, PerlMenu doesn't really do much for you except properly
display the contents of directories. I've got aspirations to give it
more hooks to call some form of GUI (Tk or FvwmForm, I think) to get
information like target directories and the like, but it's pretty much
useless right now. However, if anyone's interested in seeing the
rather odd sight of their entire directory structure laid out in fvwm
menus, feel free to check out my work to date. I've cobbled together a
page about it at http://www.best.com/~mikehan/menu.html.

If you're interested, drop me a line. The information you need for
install is on my site.

Done as Dan Espen adviced.

The moment of truth ... YES! It works! Thank you Mr. Espen :)

Well, what happens now that the problem is solved? Does the source code
of FVWM2 get updated or do I always have to build my own version of
the software ... I believe debian 2.0 is approaching and I just love
those precompiled packages.

Anyway, thanks again (for everyone) for your help!

Hi,  this is  South-Korea.  My name is   Likedew, Hong.
 I am using  Fvwm95 with  linux  slackware v3.00.  It 's so good. but  I
have a problem  which is
 concerned with  clock.
 My pc  is  pentium  pro  233MHz  which  is partitioned with  Windows95
and  Linux as  I  have just  said above.  In  Windows95 ,  the date and
time  are   correct,  but  in Linux  it doen't.  For example,  when  the
'correct' current   time is   11:30:30AM,  in Windows95   the date and
time  are correct, but  in Linux  date and time   are    15:20 PM.    I
tried to correct  the date and time with  'date' command  supported by
every Linux and Unix.  For example,   in  shell prompt,  with
super-user previledge,  I typed  1119113097.30 as the manual suggests
but , after  few hours ,  the date and time   is  again  incorrect !
 Why   the date and time  is incorrect  in  my Linux  while  in
Windows95  correct?  How can  I  correct  this situation?
It is  very  grateful  for you  to answer  my  question.  My  address
is   "likedew@silicon.korea.ac.kr"
.

DeskTopSize 4x4 sets the size of each desk to 4 by 4 "pages" not
desks. The GotoPage call does exactly that, it tranfers your viewport
to a certain page, to change desks you would use Desk 0 1 or
something. 

Your desktop looks like this (roughly):
        _________________________
	| 0 0 | 1 0 | 2 0 | 3 0 |
        _________________________
        | 0 1 | 1 1 | 2 1 | 3 1 |
        _________________________
        | 0 2 | 1 2 | 2 2 | 3 2 |
        _________________________
        | 0 3 | 1 3 | 2 3 | 3 3 |
        _________________________


so to go to the second page down on the right hand side, you would use

GotoPage 3 1

Hope this makes sense, I'm hungover as hell and not particularly well.

Could you point me to some documentation about this? I have it working on

Hiall,
I compiled fvwm v2.0.4[26] on a Dec Alpha, OSF1v4.0b, with XPM
support, using Dec's cc.
xpm is version 3.4g
No errors are displayed, but:
The desktop does not use any of my xpm images, it simply displays
blanks or nothing.
No problem is with the bitmaps and the paths are OK (Irun the
same version/setup o a Linux box w/o the problem).
Any suggestions welcome.

The problem isn't solved, it's merely identified.

What  I had   you  do  is remove   the  code in   fvwm2  that supports
application specified  aspect ratios.  We  really need to fix  it, not
remove it.

I did compare fvwm2's logic to the logic  in ctwm and even though they
have an obvious common origin, they are suspiciously different.

Last night I tried to create a test program that creates a window with
aspect ratios  to reproduce the problem,  but it seems to involve more
than turning on the  flag and setting  the x and  y values in the size
hints structure.  All this  code  is new to   me so if anyone else  is
familiar with this, please jump in.

Hi all,

Is there anyway to configure fvwm-2.46 so that a new created window
will popup ENTIRELY inside the current screen ?

Thanks,

Quoc.

But it already does this, doesn't it?  

You need to give more context: is the problem that your X server gives you a 
virtual screen?  Do you have an application which says it's one size, and then 
shortly afterwards changes size (Tcl/Tk applications can do this, if they're 
not careful)?  What else might be giving the geometry of this window---is the 
application that creates them saying where they ought to go, for example?

Help!

I'm stuck on the following:  I'd like fvwm2 to use sloppy focus, and
to raise a window on which I click (w/o modifiers).  I got this to
work with Mouse 1 click with meta depressed, but I'd rather like to
have it work without the meta.

Thanks for any hints.

A correction: (See how confused I am!)

I wrote:

What I meant to say was: 
I'd like fvwm2 to use focus-follows-mouse (do not raise focused
windows), and to raise a window on which I click (w/o modifiers).

Thanks for any hints.

        Try adding GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises to your fvwm2rc -
assuming you're running 2.0.45 or later.

        Note that there is one known, somewhat subtle, bug in this feature,
reported by Andrew Veliath to the mailing list a couple of months ago. I
don't know whether anyone's had a go at fixing it yet. If you use
MouseFocusClickRaises, *and* you don't use the DecorateTransients style,
you find that transients become unmovable by dragging - what it is, actually,
is that they don't respond to any mouse action bound to the window frame.

        If you decorate your transients -- and with the holiday season almost
upon us, I don't see why you wouldn't -- there's no problem.


        - Bob

        It's usually mapped to the ALT key.

What I really want is focus-follows-mouse, no raising on focus, but
raising on click (no modifiers).  I've tried what you suggested, i.e.,

GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises
Style "*" FocusFollowsMouse

but the windows did not get raised as commanded.

Any ideas?  I appreciate your help.

1) Aaaargh...Emacs window ??? Use VIM instead :=)

2) Then do a

Mouse 1 W A Erica

AddToFunc Erica
  "I" RaiseLower
+ "I" Focus # Or whatever command is used to only focus a window

Get the idea ?

Hope this helps you out.

So this is a cascaded menu?  In which case, no, I don't think fvwm has any 
control over where such windows go.  Not as things stand, anyway.  I don't 
think applications need to ask the window manager about windows with 
overrideredirect true.

If I remember wright solaris on install, by default, wont let you start up
your own X server you have to let xdm do it for you

so what you do is change the line in your .xinitrc
that probably starts up openwindows to fvwm instead 

Then when you are logining in the default is to cde you just switch to
openwindows and it runs xinit on your copy of .xinitrc

Hope this helps, the other option is to change the permissions on
/dev/console and a couple of others (as you fix one the next one pops up)
and then anyone can start up an X server from the console

It seems that the thing would be "GlobalOpts
MouseFocusClickRaises MouseFocusClickPassesClick" or somesuch nonesense.
Perhaps turning on "GlobalOpts ClickToFocusPassesClick" may do the trick
anyway...

This might be of interest to fvwm{2,95} users.  If you particularly like
the flexibility of fvwm, but want a more powerful configuration
language, scwm may be for you.  It obviates the need for hard to read
and difficult to improve configurations which aggressively exploit M4
(like my The Next Level setup).

Greg J. Badros
gjb@cs.washington.edu
Seattle, WA  USA
http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/gjb


Scwm 0.5 is released.

* What scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Configurable Window Manager. This is a highly
dynamic and extensible window manager (based originally on fvwm2, but
now much enhanced) with Guile Scheme as the configuration/extension
language. Nearly all decorations can be changed at run-time or
per-window, and eventually many decoration styles and additional
features will be supported through dynamically loaded code.


* Primary Authors:

Maciej Stachowiak <mstachow@mit.edu> and Greg J. Badros <gjb@cs.washington.edu>,


* Where you can find more info:

Some information about scwm is available at:

http://web.mit.edu/mstachow/www/scwm.html

There are also scwm-discuss and scwm-announce mailing lists for
disscussion and release announcements repsectively. Send mail to
Maciej Stachowiak <mstachow@mit.edu> to be added to either or both
lists.


* Where you can get it:

You can download the latest scwm package from:

http://web.mit.edu/mstachow/www/scwm-0.5.tar.gz

You will also need to download and install the guile library. You can
get the latest release from:

ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/guile-1.2.tar.gz

or any archive that has GNU source packages available.

You can get the latest guile snapshot (required for --interactive
mode) from:

ftp://red-bean.com/pub/guile

The snapshots are officially alpha but they generally work pretty
well.


* New with this release:

Many bug fixes to the build process and the program itself.

Integrated the icon distribution.

	Here is the patch for the man page, it's very simple
but I think that instructions are clear.


	I'm rewritting from scratch the code, so it can be used in Title
bars, and it can incorporate pixmaps. I hope to finnish it soon, but 
can not say when ....

	Please report bugs to me directly with the Subject FVWM BUG:, I
have too many mail and I may inadvertly ignore some messages to the list.

        I have no idea...it worked for me. Has anyone else got any

Subject: FVWM: StartsOnPage patch
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


  Based on the feedback I've gotten, the StartsOnPage patch* seems
to have been given a pretty fair workout, and to qualify as Good 
Stuff. However, it does contain a couple of misfeatures that anyone
trying it ought to consider before applying it. No show stoppers, but
they could cause some confusion and annoyance.

  I'm not issuing an updated StartsOnPage patch at this point. One 
problem is corrected by another patch that I'm keeping separate, since
it will be useful to many people who don't want to bother with 
StartsOnPage. The other is easily worked around, and I don't want to 
mess with that part of the code till Chuck has a chance to evaluate 
the whole patch, and make his recommendations.

The Problems:

1. If you don't specify

        GlobalOpts StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition

the "StartsOnDesk, SkipMapping" combo is broken. I'm of opinion that
this option should always be specified anyway, and I hope to remove
the option *and* the problem. But we'll see what Chuck says.

2. When a new ClickToFocus, SkipMapping window is created offscreen,
FVWM will take focus away from wherever you're currently focussed
and attempt to give it to the new window. Before StartsOnPage, FVWM
would recognize that the new window was offscreen, and not give it
focus. You'd lose focus, but wouldn't end up typing in the new,
invisible window. StartsOnPage breaks that -- you *will* have focus
given to the new window (if it's on the same desk, different page).
This is corrected by the DontFocusOffscreen patch*, which should
definitely be applied if you use StartsOnPage.


  --------------------------------------------------------------
  * The DontFocusOffscreen patch is on the FVWM ftp site in the
unofficial_patches directory:

        ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/unofficial_patches

The StartsOnPage patch can currently be found on my Web site:

        http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/patches

I'll try to write up a brief README for it and upload it to the fvwm
site shortly.

This is what I do, but it's not exactly what you want. But it's close:

Style "*"    SloppyFocus

Mouse 1    T    A    MoveFunc

AddToFunc MoveFunc    "M"    Move
+                                         "C"    RaiseLower


These lines will make it do SloppyFocus, but you can control raising/lowering
windows by clicking the titlebar.
This way you can move windows around without raising them, also, which is
nice sometimes. I also have it RaiseLower when you click on a border. I think
it works out pretty well. Hope it does the same for you, later-

Well I've installed the start on page patch, and using it like starts on
desk works fine 

but getting it to start on page doesn't

here is what I'm doing as an example

DeskTopSize 3x3
Style "*"	NoIcon 
Style "*"	Color Black/#42185a
Style "*"	BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4, SloppyFocus, SkipMapping
Style "*"	SmartPlacement, NakedTransient, RandomPlacement, UsePPosition
Style "*"	MWMBorder,MWMButtons,MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride
Style "*"	StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition 
Style "Netscape"	StartsOnPage 1 1 1



then at command line just type netscape &

If I'm under standing right this should start netscape on the second desk
one page down one page right.  But what I get is first desk current page.
If I change to StartsOnPage 1 it starts on the second desk as supposed to.

Could someone tell me what I've done wrong I can't seem to figure it out.

Brad

Ooo! Ooo! I know! 

I've just gotten done installing the StartsOnPage patch too, a great
piece of work, and Bob should be thanked. I had a few problems and
he was a great help working them out.

Anyway, the problem is that StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition isn't a Style,
it's a GlobalOpt. The line should read:
GlobalOpts StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition

Also, you might need to have "Style "*" NoPPosition" defined.

There  is a bug  here,  but it's in   the application.  Note that  the
application  has declared the  minimum as 4/1  and the maximum as 1/4.
The application seems to think that 4 is less  than .25.  I got better
results with the ratios in the other order.

It seems like the X  call that sets these parameters (XSetWMSizeHints)
doesn't do any range checking.   Perhaps fvwm2 should.  I've been able
to recreate the problem, and I may submit a patch  to cover this case.
(Of course anyone else that wants to can feel free.)

I can't really speak for the other window managers that didn't produce
a problem  with  this application,  but I  did  see  enough difference
between fvwm2 and ctwm to believe that  ctwm might just ignore the bad
ratios and leave the window alone.

Hi there.

I'm sorry this question isn't about FVWM, but I didn't know where else to post it.

I'd like ls to display certain files in a certain color.
When I try to arranged this on the system over here, I always end up with the same, ugly
color combinations.

Does anybody know where I can get my own color-ls thing and how I to set it up ?

Thanks in advance.

Hello there !

	To set up a color ls output you have to type 'ls --color' or just make
an alias for it.  There are way to have different files have different
colors but I think that its up to which version of ls you are using.  I
can dig up the mini-how-to and tell you how to do it.  I just boils down
to writting a .color file and sticking the file extension and desired
color for it there.  Let me know and I'll send you the goods =:)

such a file anywhere?

	There's a program called Dot File Generator and with the aid of
menus you can create a pretty descent .fvwmrc file.  The URL for the
program is http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/  Its perfect for
people like me who don't have the time of the know-how about configuring
dot files =:)

OK, then I'll inform the local representative of the software of this
problem ... we'll see if it gets corrected somewhere in the distant
future.

Hi all,

This question has probably already been asked (100 times)...
I would like to have Mouse 1 on the window sides cause the
window to resize instead of to move.  I have looked through
the Faq and the man pages to some extent but haven't been
able to figure it out.  Currently, only the corners of the
window cause the window to resize for me.

Thank you,
John

In your rc-file, you probably have this:

: Mouse 1 S A Move

or something quite similar.

Just change "Move" to "Resize".
Or, alternatively, delete the entire line and change the line

: Mouse 1 F A Resize

into

: Mouse 1 FS A Resize

(you'd better not change that A, because if you do, the mouse probably only obeys when you
simultaneously click and hold the Alt or Ctrl key <GRIN>)

I think you want:
Mouse 1 SF      A       Resize-or-Raise   (or whatever your Resize
function is)
You'll probably just have to add the S (for side) to an existing line
(the one that defines resize on the corners).  Don't forget to remove
the S from the Move line:
E.g.:
Change:
Mouse 1 TS       A       Move-or-Raise2
To:
Mouse 1 T       A       Move-or-Raise2

Hope that helps,

This works quite nicely, but movement of mouse pointer is unbelievable
slow. Maybe movement speed is configurable?

Hi,
Not sure if this has been answered before so....

Having looked through the various docs I haven't managed to find out how
you can set a window to stay on top, BUT temporarily, aka the sticky
window toggle that is available. Anybody any ideas?

Thanks for your help

Saw that but I couldn't work out how to use it in the following
scenario. After the window manager has been started I want to be able to
say 'this window should be on top now' and say, click a button on the
title bar to execute that. 
I couldn't work out how you write the button command - how do you get
the current window name for:

Mouse 0         8       A      Style [Current Window] OnTop


Sorry for not being clearer before - any ideas?

Now, I'm no FVWM expert (really!), but I think it needs to be written
like this:

*FvwmButtons(Title Pager, Icon move.xpm, Action 'Goto Page 3 3')

Myabe it works, maybe it doesn't, don't really know.

but this doesn't work. Why?

I'd guess that you have a CirculateSkip style that is matching
FvwmButtons.  If that is the case, then the answer is to add
CirculateHit to the Next command:

*FvwmButtons(Title "o", \
		   Action `Next [FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Iconify`)

	A large geometry pager could have room for more
than 1 line of infomation in the area where it puts the window
title bar's text for the given page. However, there seems to be
no way to have more than one line of text in an xterm's title
bar. I often use the escape sequence that puts a string in an
xterm's title bar.
	Has anyone ever put more than one line of text in the
xterm title bar or is it impossible?
	Or does the Pager source need to be hacked to treat a
space as a newline?
thank you

Hi,

I just recently switched to fvwm 2.0.46 after about 10 years with twm,
and I must say it's excellent.  One problem I had was that when using
FvwmPager, I had set the size spec via the option
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale.  Using a DeskTopSize of 2x1 it is very
apparent that the pager window is not properly sized based on the
virtual desktop size.  After grovelling through the code, I found that
the variables Scr.V[xy]Max are basically hardcoded in the ParseOptions
function for a 3x3 desktop.  Then initialize_pager is run, which sets
the window size.  Later, as messages from fvwm arrive and are parsed,
these variables get set correctly.  But the window is not resized and
you end up with very non-proportionally spaced windows in the pager.

Rather than delaying the creation of the pager window until after the
desktop sizes are known (the right solution, but this looked more
difficult), I fixed this bug by adding two additional (optional)
command line arguments, the desktop width and height.  Ie, in my case
you would pass "2" and "1", the same as in DeskTopSize.  Without the
arguments, the old behavior remains.  I have appended a patch below.

If you accept this patch I could send a manpage update.  Let me know.

thank you,
Greg

  Hi lads,
It has been a long time since a last bother you with a nasty question but
I keep watching what's going on here ;)

So, I'd like to be able to use my fvwm2.0.46 in 65K colors. I KNOW that
it depends only on the X Server, but if you can answer me please do so,
thanks...

I use XFree86 3.1.2 and would like to upgrade to XFree86 3.3.1 where the
XF86_SVGA server supports my Trident 9400CXi in 65K colors; however, one
needs enough disk space to compile XFree and I both
-don't have it (my disk is only 350M)
-can't afford buying a new one soon
So, Could I compile it on another machine for mine ? Is this what people
call "to cross-compile" ? My box is a i486 DX2-66 and the other one on
which I could compile is a Sun Ultra 2 running Solaris/CDE.

Thanks again if you can advice me in some way, Fabrice.

Correct. There are ways you might be able to do it, but only if X had
semaphores. Basically you have two programs (the window manager and the
application) concurrently reading and writing a shared piece of data (the
window geometry), so there's no end to the possible race conditions. Not
good. I know of no way to make a window grow upward or leftward safely in
X. I've been completely unable to get anyone to tell me a way either.

I haven't seen FvwmIconMan wandering for some time, but I avoid the upward and
leftword growing modes. A managergeometry of 0x0 isn't even legal, and causes
FvwmIconMan to give an error message and exit. Could you elaborate?

Hi there.

I tried the following in my .fvwm2rc-cpp file:

# ifdef sgi
   Read /home/avwerven/.fvwm2rc-cpp.sgi
# endif
# ifdef hpux
   Read /home/avwerven/.fvwm2rc-cpp.hp
# endif

To read seperate rc files for the different systems available here.
But this doesn't work. What am I doing wrong ?

Here's a sorta trivial question, but one I can't seem to get to work.

I have two desks, each 2x2. I want to be able to move to a specific page
on a specific desktop using the function keys and shift. So if I hit F1
it'd put on on page one of desk one, F2 page two of desk one, F3 page
one of desk two, etc. Here's what I've tried:

Key F1		A	S	Desk 0 0,GotoPage 0 0
Key F2		A	S	Desk 0 0,GotoPage 1 0
Key F3		A	S	Desk 0 1,GotoPage 0 0
Key F4		A	S	Desk 0 1,GotoPage 1 0
Key F5		A	S	Desk 0 0,GotoPage 0 1
Key F6		A	S	Desk 0 0,GotoPage 1 1
Key F7		A	S	Desk 0 1,GotoPage 0 1
Key F8		A	S	Desk 0 1,GotoPage 1 1

While the Desk command works, I move to the proper desk, the
GotoPage part doesn't get acted on. What's the proper way to bind
multiple commands to a function key?

I am running Red Hat 4.1 and fvwm95.  Just starting to play with the
config for fvwm, read the man pages and just about every FAQ I could
find but I can't figure out how to change the cursor.  What I want to
do  really is hide the cursor or at least change it to a dot when the
cursor is on the netscape window.

Sounds weird I know, but trust me I have my reasons. Any Ideas?  I am
allowing m4 to parse the config files each time I start the window
manager.

Find a program called unclutter...  I found it at ftp.x.org.  It will
hide the cursor after it has been inactive for a short period of time.
Once you move it again, the curcor on the screen will reappear.

Try making functions for this.
Something like:

Key Blablabla Func-1

AddToFunc Func-1
  "I" Desk blabla
+ "I" GotoPage blahblah

It might not be the most elegant solution, but it should work.

	Yeap, It works. But with slight modification. If I write 

AddToFunc Func-1
  "I" Desk blabla
+ "I" GotoPage blahblah

	It only executes GotoPage. But if I merge first two lines, 
	(AddToFunc Func-1	"I" Desk blabla) it works properly.
	Any problem with my setup or Any Idea.

	Also I want to make Functions with argument. 
	Does fvwm2 support it?

sometime in the late 20th century, Vinay_Kumar uttered:

| AddToFunc Func-1
|   "I" Desk blabla
| + "I" GotoPage blahblah
| 
| 	It only executes GotoPage. But if I merge first two lines, 
| 	(AddToFunc Func-1	"I" Desk blabla) it works properly.
| 	Any problem with my setup or Any Idea.

you need a '+' on the Desk line:

AddToFunc Func-1
+ "I" Desk blabla
+ "I" GotoPage blahblah

should work as expected....

| 	Also I want to make Functions with argument. 
| 	Does fvwm2 support it?

i paste now from the fvwm2 man page (where it describes AddToFunc):

       The special symbols $w and $0 through $9 are available in the Complex-
       Functions or Macros, or whatever you want to call them.  Within a
       macro, $w is expanded to the window-id (expressed in hex, i.e.
       0x10023c) of the window for which the macro was called.  $0 though $9
       are the arguments to the macro, so if you call

            Key F10 R       A       Function MailFunction xmh "-font fixed"

       and MailFunction is

            AddToFunc MailFunction     "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
            +                          "I" Next [$0] focus
            +                          "I" None [$0] Exec $0 $1

       Then the last line of the function becomes

            +                          "I" None [xmh] Exec xmh -font fixed

so the answer to your last question is, "yes". :)

Sorry to give you this kind of answer, but I suggest you use M4 instead of
Cpp.  I had problems similar to yours, which I was always able to solve
fairly quickly after I switched from Cpp to M4.  The info docs on M4 are
very helpful I found.

This is what I found too, that the first way only seems to bind the
second part of the AddToFunc, while if you do it your way it works.

In any event, it works for me now, so thanks everyone!

I have been using fvwm very happilly for a number of years. Recently
I got a brand new Sun with 24-bit color frame buffer. My default
installation still doesn't seem to give me access to more than 356
colors.

What should I do to access the 24-bit color realm and still enjoy
fvwm?? Should I use a special Xserver?

I am attempting to run fvwm on a multi-graphic head SGI Challenge
machine.  Unfortunately, fvwm when it starts up does not appear to
recognize the multiple displays....

Do you have any ideas?

I have attempted to login to one head without starting fvwm.  Then I
login to the first head (display:0.0) and start fvwm.  Unfortunately,
fvwm does not grab the first head.


There does not appear to be a way to add a head on-the-fly either.
Login into one head and then later restart and add in another
display/graphic head.



In actuality, this may be a different situation than previously
encountered since both screens have login screens and may be used
independently as opposed to a system, with only one mouse and keyboard
and two physical screens.



Why do I like FVWM?  Cause I can tell it EXACTLY how I want to work
AND I can change over time as opposed to other systems having it the
other way around!

You can have up to ten title bar buttons.  Read the fvwm2 man page, and
reply back if you are still stuck.  I'll give you a hint.  Bind a button
to something, and it will appear.  Here, for example, is what you'd add 
to your .fvwm2rc to get a second button on the left of the titlebar:

    Mouse 1 3 A Maximiz 100 100

You've got the right idea--this is to do with your X server, not your
window manager.  As far as I know, fvwm doesn't care about your color
depth.  How to make it happen depends on how X is started on your system.
Here on my Linux box, I edit the Xservers file in /etc/X11/xdm so it ends
with the line

    :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 16

to get 16-bit color.  You will probably use some other approach.  I 
suggest researching your X server--how it is started, and what its

That should be

    Mouse 1 3 A Maximize 100 100

to get button three to maximize the window both horizontally and
vertically.

hi,

i know and thats not my problem.

i have some apps (for TV-watching under X :-)) for this i need special 
max-sizes and some another functions..
.. i need this only for 2 apps or so.. decors are the best way to do
this i think.. so i can add a another titlebar to..

check out http://www.rat.de/Adam/tv.htm to see my cool 5 buttons :)
and i use 100 90 for max-size because i have a FvwmButton-bar.

When I try to build the source make runs into lots of warnings from the
compiler and near the end of the process it dies.

Are there any pre-compiled binaries or is there a fix for this install
procedure somewhere?
