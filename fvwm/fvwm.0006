Take a look at: http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html for more info...

Depending on your shell, (mine is tcsh), try:

netscape -remote openFile\(/path/file.html\)  or
netscape -remote openURL\(www.yahoo.com\)

I alias this with 'ns' to be:

ns:      aliased to /opt/netscape/netscape -remote openURL\(http://!*\)

so,
 
ns www.yahoo.com

opens yahoo wherever netscape is running...


Cheers

I found the problem. The syntax of FvwmButtons changed slightly between 2.0.42 and 2.2.4. I did some editing and fixed it.

Now the only problem I have is with xpm. It doesn't seem to be able to be found by the configure scripts. I followed the suggestions in the mail archive, INSTALL.fvwm, and the FAQ but to no avail.

I am trying to install on solaris 2.7. I have xpm installed in /usr/dept/xpm. I grabbed the binary package and installed it.

Here is the command I am trying to use to get it to work:

$ LDFLAGS=-R/usr/dept/xpm ./configure --with-xpm-includes=/usr/dept/xpm --with-xpm-library=/usr/dept/xpm

Hmm, does a binary package come with header files?
There should be a file named
/usr/dept/xpm/X11/xpm.h around.

You need to tell us what error message you got.

Here is the error message(s) from config.cache

char XpmReadFileToXpmImage();

int main() {

Don't know if this helps much.

Does anyone have their set of *.rc.m4
files posted on the web?  Many people
have their .fvwmrc files posted, but that
doesn't help me because I'm using RH's
AnotherLevel which uses the m4 preprocessor.

Thanks

Sure it helps.

The linker (ld) is looking at your archive (libXpm.a) and
saying its not a valid archive for the platform your are on.

There could be lots of causes:

. when you downloaded, you didn't download using binary mode.
. The file you downloaded is not the one your OS or OS version uses.

Tell use what OS you are using, and the steps you followed,

-or-

look in INSTALL.fvwm which points you to a source distribution of
xpm, and download and build it yourself.

Another way to check the validity of an archive is:

nm /usr/dept/R6/lib/libXpm.a

Actually, it seems that somehow configure is looking at the libXpm.a file in /usr/dept/R6/lib rather than the new version of libXpm.a in /usr/dept/xpm/lib. Is there anyway to convince configure to get the right one? It is like it is not taking my config options.

I am trying to build on solaris 2.7

I downloaded the binary version from the distribution in the install.fvwm file.

This gives me a bunch of errors, but if I do it on /usr/dept/xpm/lib/libXpm.a it seems to work correctly.

Looking thru your earlier mail, I don't see how you ran configure.

You can try the way I do it:

./configure \
  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/dept/xpm/lib\
  --with-xpm-includes=/usr/dept/xpm/include \
  --with-xpm-library=/usr/dept/xpm/lib

or re-read the section in INSTALL.fvwm where it shows how to set LDFLAGS.

Then you need to set --with-xpm-includes=/usr/dept/xpm/include, not just
/usr/dept/xpm.

  >> You need to tell us what error message you got.

  dg> Here is the error message(s) from config.cache

I assume you mean config.log here.

It's failing because it's finding /usr/dept/R6/lib/libXpm.a instead of
/usr/dep/xpm/libXpm.a; presumably the one in /usr/dept/R6/lib isn't
correct for the architecture you're using.

I suggest changing the LDFLAGS setting to include both the -L and -R
options.

In summary, try this:

  $ LDFLAGS='-L/usr/dept/xpm -R/usr/dept/xpm' ./configure --with-xpm-includes=/usr/dept/xpm/include --with-xpm-library=/usr/dept/xpm

If that doesn't work, send the errors.  Also verify that libXpm.a is
indeed in /usr/dept/xpm, and not in /usr/dept/xpm/lib or somesuch.

  I just started to use vnc while telecommuting (56k modem) and I would
like to use fvwm (as I am using it in other situations), but my defualt
config is too complex, I would like something very simple, flat borders
(solid color, no patterns or pixmaps), as few decorations as possible
(no icons, solid color menu, no opaque movement etc.).

  does anybody have (and wants to share) or know of a configuration that
was designed for this?

------------------- some random thought related to config/themes

  also, I found out that it is farily hard to find fvwm configuration
examples on the web, since there is no fvwm.themes.org wouldn't it be
possible to at least have some links at fvwm.org page?

  btw what about fvwm.themes.org? are there any plans for that or
there's nobody to maintain it?

If you actually visit the links page at fvwm.org you can find a link to
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/, which also has its own link list.

There are plans. Some patience is needed here including a patience to
wait for fvwm-2.4.

This all looks like the dialog box crashes the whole
application.  Try using fvwm's 'Close' command to close
the window.  My guess is that the application does not
rdo anything in reply.  A 'Destroy' will certainly kill
the whole application.  Another thing you might try is
to resize the offending window (you may have to turn off
the MwmFunctions or MwmHints style - can't remember which).

That's rubbish.  The window manager can do nothing to prevent
an application from redrawing itself (other that not mapping
its windows or killing it).

It *is* possible, but it's a bit different that with Windows.
The recent beta versions of fvwm come with a proper
configuration for Alt-Tab (currently 2.3.18).

Yes, usually it's easier to switch pages or desktops.  Look at the
man page sections fo DeskTopSize, GotoDesk and GotoPage for details.
You can still easily implement this:

  Key m a m all iconify off
  Key m a sm all iconify on

This binds 'iconify all' to shitf-alt-m and 'deiconify all' to
alt-m.

I'm not sure what you mean.  Here is an example:

  *FvwmButtons(2x2, swallow xclock `Exec exec xcloca`k)

To remove the border around the FvwmButtons window:

  Style FvwmButtons NoTitle, HandleWidth 0

To remove borders around the buttons:

  *FvwmButtonsPadding 0 0

If you use bash (the standard Linux shell) it should be /etc/profile
or some file named /etc/bash...

Use the CursorStyle command with the MENU context.  Or simply
change to a newer fvwm release.  The cursor has been changed
a while ago.

You can use a program like 'sudo' which allows you to execute
certain commands with root permissions.

I'm not sure which example you mean since you don't say which release
you use.  I have this in my config file:

  AddToMenu BrowseMenu
  + DynamicPopupAction Piperead 'fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu'

(fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh is a script coming with the current beta
releases.)

Hi,

I have not posted my *.rc.m4 files, but I'm certainly willing to do so.
Do you want a copy of the whole package, or just select files.  I haven't
done too much in modifying them.  Unfortunately it's a little more complex
than simply posting a single .fvwm2rc file.  Tell me what you're looking
for and maybe I can help.

Tom

If this belongs to the workers list, all apologies. . .

Has anyone tried using the latest beta versions of fvwm as the wm for
KDE?  How well does it work under KDE?  Anything special need to be done
for fvwm to work like this?

Thanks for any answers to this.

Better yet use fvwm's 'Delete' command.  If nothing happens it means the
application doesn't support the delete protocol and consequently the
fvwm 'Close' command will revert to doing a 'Destroy'.

Ah, not necessarily.  A destroy can fail too if the
application claims it supports the delete protocol but
does not delete itself.  That's what I tried to find
out with my suggestion.

Dominik meant 'close' here, of course.

Everytime I iconify a window, after
I deiconify it the window then will
take up the whole screen instead of
resuming the previous size and location.
It is very annoying.  

Will a fresh set of *rc.m4 files do 
the trick?

Hello Everone,

I am trying to make a fvwm function, and I need some guidance. 
I want it to raise and move my clock to the center of the 
screen, then move it back when I run the function again. This 
is what I've got right now:

Key c  A   MC  SeeHideFunc "2.1.10*"
# "2.1.10*" is the title of my clock.

DestroyFunc SeeFunc
AddToFunc SeeFunc
+ I All ($0)         Raise
+ I All ($0)         AnimatedMove +44 +44
+ I All ($0)         Stick

DestroyFunc HideFunc
AddToFunc HideFunc
+ I All ($0)         Lower
+ I All ($0)         AnimatedMove -0 -0
+ I All ($0)         Stick

DestroyFunc SeeHideFunc
AddToFunc SeeHideFunc
+ I All ($0, "!Sticky")   HideFunc $0
+ I All ($0, "Sticky")    SeeFunc  $0

The problem is: SeeHideFunc executes HideFunc AND SeeFunc. Is there a
way to only execute one? Or is there a better way do write my function?

Thanks,
sa

DestroyFunc SeeHideFunc

+ I All (asclock, Sticky)    SeeFunc
+ I All (asclock, !Sticky)   HideFunc

DestroyFunc HideFunc
AddToFunc HideFunc
+ I All (asclock)   Layer 0 2
+ I All (asclock)   AnimatedMove -0 -0
+ I All (asclock)   Stick On

DestroyFunc SeeFunc

Probably.  This really sounds like a configuration problem.
If you post your config file and tell us how you deiconify
the icon (e.g. by a mouse click) we might see where the
problem is (and tell us the fvwm release you're using).

Remove the line

  + I All ($0)         Stick

from the SeeFunc and the HideFunc and add it to SeeHideFunc
instead.  Also, I think the syntax of the condition is incorrect.
I think you may not use a comma to separate conditions.

  DestroyFunc SeeFunc
  AddToFunc SeeFunc
  + I All ($0)         Raise
  + I All ($0)         AnimatedMove +44 +44

  DestroyFunc HideFunc
  AddToFunc HideFunc
  + I All ($0)         Lower
  + I All ($0)         AnimatedMove -0 -0

  DestroyFunc SeeHideFunc
  AddToFunc SeeHideFunc
  + I All ($0 "!Sticky")   HideFunc $0
  + I All ($0 "Sticky")    SeeFunc  $0
  + I All ($0)         Stick

Ahh, thanks this is much better than what I came up with. 

BTW, the man page says:
      All [(conditions)] command
              Execute.  command on all windows meeting the condi<AD>
              tions.   Conditions  are  used  exactly as with the
              Current command.

      Current [(condition...)] command
              Performs command on the currently focused window if
              it  satisfies all conditions.  The contidions are a
              list of keywords from the list below and are  sepa<AD>
              rated  by commas or whitespace. 
                        ^^^^^^
Thanks,
sa

Peter,

I see that you're having some troubles... One last question and I'll tar
it up for you.  I have two installations.  I have the default AnotherLevel
installation /etc/X11/Anotherlevel (which you can always download from
rufus) and I have also made a personal copy for myself, installed it in
~/AnotherLevel and edited that.  Finally John Latham has also edited this
package and put together another variant for which he has built rpms.  I
attached his email below.  Which do you want?

Finally, let me ask...  I assume that you're having this trouble because
you chose to edit the default installation files, right?  You do know that
you can simply copy the files to your home directory, delete the .m4 from
the end and add a "." to the front of the file name and that is the file
which will be used when booting, right?  That way you never run into this
problem, right?

Tom

Okay, I have put together a `pre-release' of my next version (dated 20th
April!) as rpms. It's not that different from the March 27th `tar' release at
the moment, but it may have one or two more features by April 20th (e.g. the
shutdown feature..)! :-)

If you do try it, then please let me know if it works/fails, etc.. I'll be
away from my email from now until Friday evening: going to get some beer!
After that, I'll be happy to answer any question, and give you a hand
tailoring it, etc..

Install RPM:
	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU/AnotherLevelUp-000420-1.noarch.rpm

Source RPM:
	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU/AnotherLevelUp-000420-1.src.rpm

These are not referred to on the web site yet, just stand-alone URL's.

You'll want to uninstall AnotherLevel first (else it conflicts). Don't worry,
AnotherLevelUp contans all the same icons (and more) that AnotherLevel puts
into /usr/share/icons.

	rpm -e AnotherLevel
	rpm -i AnotherLevelUp-000420-1.noarch.rpm

It should work `out of the box' on RH6.1 (I haven't tried it on RH6.2 yet...).

To get `full functionality' you might also consider getting hold of:

	xsnow: nice desktop feature.
		Last RPM I have was from RPM's Galore, CD, Summer 99. Prior to
		that it was in Red Hat 5.2.

	xv: good package anyway, but nice here for it's bggen program to get
			stripey backgrounds.
		Last RPM I have was from RPM's Galore, CD, Summer 99. Prior to
                that it was in Red Hat 5.2.

	xearth: lovely desktop background feature.
		Still comes with RH6.1. RH6.2 has shifted it to power tools.

	xlbiff: a great `xbiff' program, which pops up a window showing your
			latest 10 mail headers (well, when plugged into ALU, it does).
		But not an RPM yet. :-( Maybe I should package it?

Other `non RH6.1 standard' programs ALU knows about (i.e. has `plugs' for) are:

	Editors: (Currently, it offers these choices even when they're not installed!)
		jove - editor (cut down emacs, cheep cheerful).
		nedit - editor (easy, novice friendly)
		xemacs - editor

	ddd - a nice debugger

Perhaps I'll eventually dig out some URLs for all these, and stick them on the ALU web site.

Good luck!

Ta, John

Yes.  I wrote that two weeks ago when I noticed that conditions
didn't accept commas.  The first release where this appeared was
2.3.17.

Hi

Please bare with me if someone has asked this before - I wasn't able to find
an answer in the mail-archive.

I like to be able to Alt-Tab between my windows. I also like to have a
permanent xclock and xload running on my desktop. However when either xclock
or xload is running the Alt-Tab function doesn't work. It stalls at the first
window. I was wondering if its possible to give an application/window the
abbility _not_ to accept focus or ignore it (like the pager)?

My configuration is pasted in below:

Style "xclock"  NoTitle
Style "xload"   NoTitle

# Alt+Tab conf
Key Tab         A       M       Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab         A       CM      Next [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus
Key Tab         A       CMS     Prev [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus

(the latter has been stolen from the Debian system.fvwm2rc)

You probably want to experiment with all or several style options:

Style "xclock"  NoTitle, CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip, NeverFocus

See your local fvwm2 man page to get info about them.
Also you may consider to bind WindowList to Alt-Tab or Alt-Escape.
I hope this helps. Otherwise explain better what do you mean by "stalls".

Regards,
Mikhael.

CirculateSkip exactly! That did the trick :)

I may not remember exact details, but it is impossible to simply replace
kwm with fvwm (in startkde script). KDE starts krootwm to enable clicking
on background and fvwm can't be started after krootwm on the same display.

Of course it is possible to start pure fvwm and run almost all KDE
applications, but some applications (like kpanel) require KDE-compliant
window manager and will not run under fvwm unless you specify
-no-KDE-compliant-window-manager parameter.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I would like to know whether it would be possible to implement
selection menus with scrollbars in FvwmForm. This could be quite
useful especially in conjunction with long lists possibly generated
by PipeRead.

Thanks,

Neil

Has anyone else had this problem with fvwm-2.2.4 and AnotherLevel-1.0: 
When NumLock is on, clicking on window buttons (e.g., minimize) doesn't
work.  If you toggle NumLock off, the buttons work fine.

Thanks for any help with this.

hi there...

this may be beyond the scope of a window manager but i figured that,
since fvwm does so much already, that this might be possible...

basically what i want to do is have a terminal window that normally
stays iconified... whenever there is some output in the terminal window,
it should pop up on top of all other windows on whatever desktop/screen
the user is on, sit there for maybe 3 seconds, and then iconify itself
again

can this be done?

-greg-

rxvt has this:

     mapAlert: boolean
          True:  deiconify (map) on receipt of a bell  character.
          False:  no deiconify (map) on receipt of a bell charac-
          ter [default].

Fvwm wouldn't be  able  to  do  the  deiconify,  its unaware  of   the
application putting output in the window.

Um... if you pipe the output through a filter, which dumps xterm control
sequences, then yes, you can, but that isn't really fvwm related...

The sequences you want are: 

CSI 1 t

 and

CSI 2 t

[ I can send you a perl script that converts those symbolic sequences into 
  7 or 8 bit control sequences, if you like, since I wrote one the other
  day... synchronicity is spooky ]

I think CSI is: [7bit]: 0x1b 0x5b
            or: [8bit]: 0x9b

depending on whether you're in 7 or 8 bit mode...

You might be able to do other funky things with setting the xterm names 
and FvwmEvent, iirc, but I don't really know much about that.

Hi,

Right now Alt-Tab shows and switches between all the windows currently
running. How can I limit it so that it shows windows only in the current
desktop.

Also, after I hit alt-tab, I have to hit space or enter to select a
window. Is there any way to avoid that, like kde for example.

I am running fvwm on an ultra sparc machine, and I keep running out of
colors. Right now Its an 8 bit display, how can I change it.
TIA,
Vikas

Well, I believe that somehow xconsole can be configured to change the
icon title to prepend an asterisk (*) or something when there's new
output. FvwmEvent can respond to icon title events, so you might be
able to work some magic here.

  I am using fvwm 2.2.4 and would like to restart with different
configuration file, but the manual page says:

... This command should not have a  trailing  ampersand  or any 
command  line arguments...

  how can I restart with different configuration?

  what I am trying to accomplish: I have two setups - complex that I use
over LAN and really lean one (no bevels, no patterns etc.) to use over
modem line. I am using vnc, so I would like to be able to connect from
home and restart fvwm with lean config or connect from work and restart
fvwm with fancy config (the X server and all programs are running all
the time, it's the vnc connect/disconnect I am talking about).

  TIA

If you use 2.2 or previous versions, you should create a shell script,
say, fvwm-with-rcN and then "Restart fvwm-with-my-rc2". The script has
one line:

	exec fvwm2 -f rcN

In 2.3 versions you can simply execute "Restart fvwm2 -f rcN".
In the latest versions, rcN is searched in $HOME/.fvwm instead of $HOME.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well the following works for me:
Key Tab         A       M       Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab         A       CM      Next [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus
Key Tab         A       CMS     Prev [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus

else you might want to have a look at the FAQ at the homepage.

Scan for NumLock in:

Actually there is an addition.
Check your bindings which stopped to work, probably you can convert some
of them from "Mouse 1 6 N Iconify" to "Mouse 1 6 A Iconify".

Note that FVWM follows Linux-like release structure: 2.3.x are the
alpha/beta releases for the next stable release, 2.4.

There is currently support for GNOME in the beta (2.3.x) versions of
FVWM.  You need to use --enable-gnome when you configure it, IIRC, to
get that support.

Hello,

I would like fvwm2 to resize xterm windows that get mapped onto
the desktop for the first time as follows: if the xterm has a
font such that its height or width is larger than the viewport
height or width then fvwm2 resizes the xterm so that it fits
entirely inside the viewport.

Is this possible?

Thanks,

Neil

  thanks, that's what I was afraid of:-) it's working fine though...

  "it's in 2.3" seems to be prevalent response here lately, I hope that
means 2.4 is close... I'm patient, I'm patient! :-)

	Speaking of those kind of sequences, where can I get the complete

	Yes, or, CSI is decimal 155 or decimal 27(Esc) and 91([).

Try using the MaxWindowSize style.

Perhaps I should have been a little bit clearer. The MaxWindowSize style
will indeed resize the xterm window so that it is entirely contained in
the viewport but if I later decide to resize xterm so that it spans two
or more viewports then I cannot do it. It would be nice if there were
a Style option called MaxWindowStartupSize which would act exactly like
MaxWindowSize except for once the window pops up the user can resize it
to any size. The MaxWindowStartupSize would only affect the geometry of
the window when it gets mapped onto the desktop for the first time.

Thanks,

Neil

  This isn't really a FVWM question, but I'm hoping that someone on the
FVWM-programming side of things will know the answer.

  I have a couple of override-redirect windows (yes, I know), and in order
to maintain some semblance of control (mainly under FVWM, but also under
Exceed), I'd like to keep the windows, when they're open, one level above
their parents (instead of at the top of the window stack).

  Then, if the parent window is pushed to the back, the popup follows it.


  I suspect I ought to use XRestackWindows, but I only get BadWindow
errors. I think that's something to do with the windows not being
'siblings' (I've not found a useful definition of that), and that, under
FVWM (or any WM) the 'parent' window is really a collection of windows
holding borders and the like (as revealed by xlswins -l).

  Anyone any pointers? I do have /an/ X window-id for the parent and for
the override-redirect window, which I believe correspond to the actual
client windows (underneath all the WM gubbins).

Sibling window have the same parent. The parent of your
override-redirect window will be the root window and the parent of your
normal client will be an fvwm window so you won't be able to use
XRestack on them both.

Well, you could use XQueryTree() recursively to find the window that is
a child of the root and is an ancestor of your normal client (under fvwm
it is the grandparent of the client, other window managers are
different). You can restack these two but be aware that fvwm may get
confused or it may restack them itself in a different order. i.e. don't
expect this to work for long.

Cheers,
Tim.

Unfortunately the important part of the patch broke MouseFocus.
I removed one half but thought this one wasn't imnportant.
Obviously it is.

Hello -

I'm running fvwm 2.2.2 in RedHat 6.1.
When I run, eg, linuxconf, I'm getting
error messages from gtk+, eg:

	Error message from remadmin :Gtk-CRITICAL **: file 		gtkwidget.c: line
1584 (gtk_widget_map): assertion 		`GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE (widget) == TRUE'
failed.

What is happening? and how can I fix this?

Thanks,
- Ted

  That's OK; I really only wanted it to be a one-shot "make sure the
b#gger's moved out of the way" of the window is lowered (ir vice-versa if
the parent's re-raised).

  As it happens (there's a 'yeugh' coming) I'll have to 'keep' doing it
all the time the popup's up (10 times a second) since the GUI builder we
use doesn't notify us of [it's parent] window raise/lowers.

Those messages are not caused by fvwm2, but by the GTK+ application, in
this case linuxconf. It might help if you upgrade to the latest
linuxconf (and GTK+). I don't know that much about it, so it also might
be solved when you upgrade the GTK+ lib.

Hi

For use in an 'fvwm2 theme' 
I'd like to know if there is a possibility to
retreive the values of the shade and hilight 
colors as calculated by fvwm2, when a certain 
back ground color is given. 

I also noticed that the shade and hilight colors 
of the 'motif-style' window decorations are not the 
same as in the motif window manager. In fvwm2 the 
hilight colors seem to light. Doesn't fvwm use the 
same color calculations as motif? 

best regardz

  OK, this is, erm, doing something now.

  I'm issuing (once I've found the correct window IDs) an XRestackWindows
on (popup_id,parent_id).

  I'd *expect* this to put the parent window(s) under the popup (not quite
what I want yet - I want to move the popup, but I'll deal with that
later).

  What /actually/ happens is that the (override redirect) popup appears on
top, then I issue the call & the parent window moves from 2nd.-to-top (it
was /on/ top) to the very bottom of the window stack (under EVERYTHING,
not just the popup).

  What on Earth's going on? Is that supposed to happen with a Restack?

I haven't the faintest what's going on but have you tried this without a
window manager?

Version 2.3.8 and later let's you use $[hilight.cs0] and $[shadow.cs0]
in functions. You have to use FvwmTheme to manage the colorsets but once
you figured out that you can get at the colors by e.g.

AddToFunc getcolors I Exec echo $[hilight.cs0] $[shadow.cs0] > shade.txt

Until very recently the Motif shade calculations were secret.  Anyway
Motif has changed the algorithm with every new version. Now that Motif
source is available I guess we could use it (it's probably a small
enough % to get away with fair use) or even figure out how to get fvwm
to interact with the CDE color server.

Tim.

  I think I got the same thing under Exceed, but I didn't try /no/ WM.

  Anyway, I got what I wanted by using the method I'd tried originally
(albeit with the correct [child of root] window IDs): XConfigureWindow on
the popup, and restack=above-sibling(parent). Works a treat.

hi there...

i was wondering if any of the fvwm coding gurus would point me in the
right direction in order to implement the SqueezeTitleBars funtionality
that is in twm...

basically SqueezeTitleBars makes the title bar about 1/3rd the width of
the window...

i've tried poking around with this a bit but have had no success

thanks much

Well, this enhancement request is waiting to be done for a while
now.  I thought a bit about a possible implementation, and the
best design I could come up with is this:

 1) Use the Shape X extension to hide the right half of the
    title bar.
 2) Modify the border drawing and button placement code in
    borders.c.
 3) Adapt animated window shade and opaque resizing to these
    changes.
 4) Introduce a new style (style.c, update.c, style.h, fvwm.h,
    window_flags.h).

(this all refers to the latest beta versions).

Overall this feature will become very difficult to implement.

Bye

i am a new user have some basic questions:
lets start w/the 1st thing i see in my system.fvwm2rc file:

EdgeResistance 250 10

I read the man fvwm2 entree for EdgeResistance but I don't understand -
could you rephrase it a different way and maybe I'll get the concept.

Thanks

btw, what's a "viewport"?

Hello,

You might want to read the section of the fvwm2 man page entitled
"THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP" as it explains the difference between desktops,
pages, and viewports. You may also want to look at the DeskTopSize
command as you need a desktop larger than 1x1 (i.e. more than one page)
to use the EdgeResistance feature. If the EdgeResistance feature does
not seem to be working for you then perhaps your configuration script
implements multiple desktops but not multiple pages per desktop.

Bye,

Neil

Please,

I would deeply appreciate if someone would rephrase the manual entree, or
perhaps a brief practical example of what this setting - EdgeResistance 250
10
 -  does. say it's eg desktop 2x2.

Yes, I have printed out and am "barnstorming" the manual ( all 63 pages ).
As well as going thru my system.fvwn2rc line by line to get acquainted w/the
config. Would anyone indulge me for a moment and offer their explaination
of: EdgeResistance 250 10.

Thank You

The best way to understand the command is to try different values.
You can issue the command without restarting fvwm with FvwmTalk.

Refer to the man page text below.

For "scrolling" try values like 100 (tenth of a second) and 1000
(1 second). Move the pointer to the edge of the screen and hold it
there a while.  Try the righthand edge of the screen first.

For "moving" try 1, 100, and 1000.  With the mouse put the pointer
on the frame or titlebar of a window and try to drag the window off
the edge of the screen.


     EdgeResistance scrolling moving
          Tells how hard it  should  be  to  change  the  desktop
          viewport  by  moving  the  mouse  over  the edge of the
          screen and how hard it should be to move a window  over
          the edge of the screen.

          The first parameter tells  how  many  milliseconds  the
          pointer  must spend on the screen edge before fvwm will
          move the viewport.  This is intended for people who use

               EdgeScroll 100 100

          but find themselves accidentally  flipping  pages  when
          they don't want to.

          The second parameter tells how  many  pixels  over  the
          edge  of the screen a window's edge must move before it
          actually moves partially off the  screen.   By  default
          the  viewport  is  moved  a  full page in the requested
          direction, but if  you  used  EdgeScroll  and  set  any
          values other than zero they will be used instead.

          Note that, with

               EdgeScroll 0 0

          it is still possible to move or resize  windows  across
          the  edge  of  the current screen.  By making the first
          parameter to EdgeResistance 10000 this type  of  motion
          is impossible.  With EdgeResistance less than 10000 but
          greater than 0 moving over pages becomes difficult  but
          not impossible.  See also EdgeThickness.


After trying a few values, the man page explanation should make more
sense.

Hi.

I've a little problem with fvwm2. I've recently upgraded from fvwm95,
and now some windows (modal windows of some aplications) have not
title bar (and resizing handlers, or how they are called). My config
file is my old trusty .fvwm95rc slighty modified (the paths, only).
Anybody can tell me how to get the old behaviour (all windows should
have the title except when NoTitle is specified in a "Style" line)?

In fact, I have the following line in my config file:

Style "*" Title, BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5

Thanks in advance.

I've tried under X the tool Desktop Switching Tool and now I'm in FVWM.
But I want to go back to KDE or GNOME.
But how do I doe that? I've tried it with Desktop Switching Tool under FVWM but that doesn't work. Then I've tried Switchdesk but that doesn't either work.
Do you have another option??

Thanks

I _think_ 'DecorateTransient' is what you want, try adding it to your
default style.

>From the man page:

              DecorateTransient causes transient  windows,  which
              are  normally  left  undecorated,  to  be given the
              usual fvwm decorations (title bar, buttons,  etc.).
              Note  that  some  pop-up windows, such as the xterm
              menus, are not managed by the  window  manager  and
              still  do  not  receive decorations. NakedTransient
              (the default) causes transient windows  not  to  be

It looks like you could write 'GNOME' in /etc/sysconfig/desktop.

read the file: /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients for more info

What Linux dist. do you use? RedHat ?  How do you log in gdm, xdm, or just
terminal and startx?  Have you looked at the files .xsession or .Xclients
in your home directory?  FVWM is not in control of whether or not it is
chosen as your window manager.

Hi folks,

Does anyone know how to supress console messages from popping up
on the bottom of my window??  Everytime they appear I must "Redraw"
to clean up my desktop.




Regards,

Anthony

The simplest thing to do is run a program that grabs the console output.
Then the console messages will go to that program instead of the screen.
One of these is xconsole.  You can also start an xterm with the -C
option to grab the console output.

See the man pages (this isn't a function of your window manager).

Run one of the console programs, like "contool", "xconsole", or even
"xterm -C".

If that doesn't help, mention the OS you are using.

I don't know what system you are running Michel, but you might try...

control  alt  backspace.....that should kill x...then you will be at a
$ prompt,,...type in  desktopcfg   that should give you a little panel
with several selections on it.

Is there a setting that prevents an application from owning the whole screen?
So that if a window hangs, i can still access everything else?

Does anyone use ie5 on solaris?
Do you find that it likes to dive to the bottom when popping up windows...or for some other reason?

Does fvwm complain about its icons unless you set NoIcon?

When i exit fvwm (2.3.16), i dont return to "dos prompt".

If the application does an X Server grab, theres nothing fvwm
can do about it.

As your .xinitrc shows, you are running fvwm2 detached from your .xinitrc.
(In the background.)
If fvwm2 exits, you are without a window manager.

Your .xinitrc is held by this "wait" command.  If the wait command were to
end, then your X Session would end and you would be back at the command
prompt.

If you wanted the window manager to hold your X Session, you would put it
last in your .xinitrc and not put an ampersand at the end.

Just a small suggestion I wanted to make concerning shaded windows.

When I try to resize a shaded window, it starts the resize operation
with the original size. The new windows dimensions will only be visible
when it's unshaded. Wouldn't it be more userfriendly if resizing a
shaded window automaticly changes it into a unshaded state with the
chosen dimension?

Thanks again to all the people who contribute to fvwm2.

You can write a functions to do this:

AddToFunc my_resize I WindowShade False
+ I Resize

If you already have the Resize in a function you can just put the
Windowshade line before it.

It's a bad idea for fvwm commands to do anything more complex than
necessary, it loses flexibility and make it much harder to test which
means bugs creep in.

Cheers,
Tim.

In the fvwmrc2.init.m4 file you can
specify apps to be fired up when the
xserver is started.  Is there any way
of placing apps in a particular desktop/
window?  

Thanks

Those are 2 examples of how to do something similar to FvwmTalk using
FvwmForm.

> 2. what is FvwmForm Alias?

Hmm, doesn't look like its explained very well in the 2.2.4 man page.
Heres the current man page explanation adjusted to describe 2.2.4:

     Normally  you would invoke FvwmForm  with  an alias represent the
     name of a form, and its configuration commands.  For example, the
     command  "Module  FvwmForm Rlogin"   uses  configuration commands
     starting with "*Rlogin".

> 3. what does the term swallowing refer to?

Embedding an application inside an fvwm module.  This is how Perfmeters
get embedded in FvwmButtons.

> 4. what are sample functions for? eg. AddtoFunc MailFunction?

I don't know what you mean.  Do you want to know why we provide samples,
or what MailFunction does?

We provide samples to help people understand fvwm.

Mailfunction shows how to have one menu entry that both starts and
deiconifies and focuses an application.

> 5. why would i need remote logins? eg. snoopy?

If you had more than one computer and you wanted to access it remotely
the example shows how.

I'm haveing some problems with fvwm2. When I use netscape and I browse through
pages that uses java fvwm sort of freezes. All key-bindings and mouse-bindings
stop working. Not even a restart will help - only to kill X. 

Has anyone experienced anything like it? Does anyone have a clue on how to
debug such a thing - do I start with fvwm2 or X?

I'm using Netscape 4.73 with 128bit encryption, XFree86-3.3.6 and fvwm 2.2.4.
It happens while running either Linux or FreeBSD.


Any help is much appreciated
Sven

I have the same problem. Recently a found a cool java game
(http://www.plutoniumsoftware.com/ -> Burning metal). When I launch it,
both through Netscape or appletviewer, it opens a full screen window and if
an error is encountered and the game is stopped I have no way to close this
window. No keys, no mouse clicks work. Nothing at all. This window seems to
be as ignorant to anything as an xlock window. Have to telnet from another
compute and kill java process.

Would like to hear the answer too.

I am using:

Netscape 4.73,
java version "1.2" Solaris VM (build Solaris_JDK_1.2_01, native threads, sunwjit),
SUN Openwindows 3.6.1.0,
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.17 compiled on May 15 2000 at 16:43:09

SE> Any help is much appreciated

Yeah, me too please! ;-)

Gregory.

P.S. Does anyone know how do I tell TaskBar to stay on top of all windows
that are places in the bottom of the screen? If I do so I can probably use
it to kill the annoying window that takes the whole screen.

This is probably a bad question to ask, but did any of the control keys
get turned on like caps-lock or num-lock.  I've seen things like this
before with netscape (my system is almost identical to yours) but I
thought it a fluke...

I have Red Hat Linux 5.2, and an earlier version of fvwm2.  I had a .bmp 
and/or a .jpg image I wanted to make the background, so I emailed some smart 
people and they said to use xv.  Since the .fvwm2rc doesn't work, I finally 
found the real config files in /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/. When I go into xv and 
i bring up the image, I click on root, tiled, and its there.  I notice in the 
FAQ you did it in the .fvwm2rc file, butwhat exactly do you write if you have 
the fvwm2.init.m4 file where it sets the background?
could you please answer me and tell me, in all your linux knowledge, what 
code to write?  oh yeah right now it has the xsetroot command there, and that 
cannot display my image.

Hi,

So, the first thing I would say is that there are many ways to deal with
this.  First of all, if you want to modify one of the .m4 files in
/etc/X11/AnotherLevel, copy it to your home directory and rename it by
adding a "." in front of the name and deleting the ".m4" suffix.  The
reason is if you look at /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4 you will find
this:

define(`readFile', `dnl
syscmd(`test -f $HOME'/.$1)dnl
ifelse(sysval,0,`sinclude(esyscmd(`echo -n $HOME')/.$1)',
`sinclude(ANOTHERLEVEL/$1.m4)')')dnl

This defines an m4 command "readFile" which will first look in your home
directory and then at the default installation for some configuration
file.

eg.

# Now read in some interesting macros...
readFile(`fvwm2rc.macros')

My preference is to use FvwmBacker, xsetroot and xpm files.  So in your
situation I would copy /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.modules.m4 to
~/.fvwm2rc.modules and insert something like this:

##### FvwmBacker
# Set Up Backgrounds for different desktops.
*FvwmBackerDesk 0 Exec xpmroot HOME/tiles/cyan5mra.xpm
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 Exec xpmroot HOME/tiles/pebble_town.xpm

Then I would copy  /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.init.m4 to
~/.fvwm2rc.init and modify it.  You will find something which looks like
this:

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec xsetroot -solid BG_COLOR
...

I would comment out this line (insert a # in front of the +) and add this
either before or after it.

+ "I" Module  FvwmBacker

This will start up the FvwmBacker module which will set up the backgroud
for you when you switch desks.  If you want to use xv instead of xpmroot
just change the command in the module configuration file
~/.fvwm2rc.modules for FvwmBacker.

Hmmm... yes it sounds like a fluke but - I thought I should give it a try
since I usually use my Numeric Keypad while connected to homebanking. This
requires 'Num Lock' which I had not connected with the strange fvwm behaviour. 

I connected to the bank (without using the Numeric Keypad this time) and behold
fvwm still works. Now before I rush out and talk to one of the developers I
would really like if someone else could reproduce this beahviour.

All I asking is for someone (preferably several people) to enable java in your
Netscape browser, go to a site with java, hit Num Lock while you're there and
sees if your mouse- and key-bindings freeze.


As mentioned before, I use Linux/FreeBSD, Netscape Communicator 4.73 128bit
, Xfree86-3.3.6 and fvwm-2.2.4.


Please post your results to the mailinglist.

  the key/mouse-bindings are defined for given modifiers. numlock is one
of the modifiers (just like alt, shift or ctrl are), so pressing crtl-a
and ctrl-a-with-numlock-enabled are two different key-bindings.

  I have most of the mouse/key-bindigs twice, with and without numlock.

Thanx for the info. I just found an old message with more or less the same

You're misunderstanding what's happening.  Your mouse and key bindings
aren't freezing when NUMLOCK is pressed.  It's just that when a modifier
like NUMLOCK, CTRL, etc. is pressed, the keysequences transmitted to the
client aren't the same as they were before.  If you press "p" and
"CTRL-p", the client gets different symbols.  Ditto for "F1" and
"NUMLOCK-F1".  Things bound to F1 won't be activated when you type
NUMLOCK-F1, just like they won't be activated when you type SHIFT-F1, etc.

There is no "freezing" going on, it's just that the key and mouse
strokes you're using when NUMLOCK is set aren't bound to any commands.

See the FVWM FAQ, question 5.5.

I went there.   The  game covered my  screen and   none of  my  global
keybindings  worked.  I don't  believe "NumLock" or  "CapsLock" is the
issue.  I did this with Solaris 8 on an Ultra 5.

I haven't had time to dig much deeper.  Maybe  I'll get a chance again
tomorrow.

I went back to the given URL and tried a few things.

First my fvwm keybindings do work, its just a little hard to tell that
they are working.

The first thing I tried was "Control arrow" which I have bound like this:

Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100
Key Down	A	C	Scroll +0   +100

I didn't think they were working since the game created window doesn't
even seem to flicker.  But then I noticed that the pointer was changing
shape at the screen edges as it entered fvwm's panframes.  Using the
panframes as a guide, I was able to tell that the "Control arrow" keys
were working.

I have a key binding for FvwmIdent.  Normally if I use it over a window,
I get an FvwmIdent window.  Over this Java window, I get a crosshair.
When I clicked on the Java window, I didn't see anything happen.

Later after killing Netscape, I found the FvwmIdent windows.  They picked
up the application underneath.

With about 5 FvwmIdents running, many attempts to delete and destroy
Netscape thru fvwm, I managed to crash fvwm:

This is the relevant section of our FAQ (and this one is surely
the most frequently asked question).  The IgnoreModifiers
command is new in the 2.3.x betas, but the part about xmodmap
works in 2.2.4 too:

----------------------- snip --------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in you configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine ore very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. E.g. do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.

This is probably an X question, but does anyone know how I might config Xfree86/fvwm to paste the buffer when I hit the insert key?

Thanks

  This'll be entirely dependant upon the app. you want to do the paste in
- if many, then you'll need to set up each individually. FVWM does take
any part in that sort of action.

  However.


  You *can* in FVWM map the <Insert> key to call a program, passing the
window ID that has focus as an arg. You can then make that program perform
a fake key-press in the window; in this case, you'd want <Ctrl-V> I
imagine.

  Bit OTT, mind, but it'll work! (I do a similar thing to reformat emails
in Netscape; I have a key that runs up vim, then a vim script that grabs
the current selection, reformats it, and calls my prog. to fake a <Del>
then a <Ctrl-V> in the NS window to paste the edited contents
automatically back.)


  I have a very noddy xKeyClick.c thing that you could compile up & call;
if you're actually interested I'll email [the source] (or post it; it's
only 2Kb or so).

It would have to be done at the X resource level, mostly on a per
application basis.  This works for XTerm:

XTerm*VT100.translations:#override\n\
	<Key>Insert:	insert-selection(PRIMARY)

I don't know how far you would get if you tried:

*translations:#override\n\
	<Key>Insert:	insert-selection(PRIMARY)

I am sure this has come up before, but I just joined the list and all of
the information I could find in the online archives was years old and had
broken links, so...
Please forgive a newbie for addressing what may be a tired subject.
Is it possible to have vertical title bars in FVWM?  If so, how?
Like I said, all of the links I found for patches to enable this were
broken.  :(
Thanks for any assistance.

I'm haveing some problems with fvwm2. When I use netscape and I browse =
through
pages that uses java fvwm sort of freezes. All key-bindings and =
mouse-bindings
stop working. Not even a restart will help - only to kill X.=20

Has anyone experienced anything like it? Does anyone have a clue on how =

debug such a thing - do I start with fvwm2 or X?

I'm using Netscape 4.73 with 128bit encryption, XFree86-3.3.6 and fvwm =
2.2.4.
It happens while running either Linux or FreeBSD.


Any help is much appreciated

Hmmm... yes it sounds like a fluke but - I thought I should give it a =

since I usually use my Numeric Keypad while connected to homebanking. =
This

I connected to the bank (without using the Numeric Keypad this time) and =

fvwm still works. Now before I rush out and talk to one of the =

All I asking is for someone (preferably several people) to enable java =

Netscape browser, go to a site with java, hit Num Lock while you're =
there and
sees if your mouse- and key-bindings freeze.


As mentioned before, I use Linux/FreeBSD, Netscape Communicator 4.73 =
128bit
, Xfree86-3.3.6 and fvwm-2.2.4.

This is probably a bad question to ask, but did any of the control keys
get turned on like caps-lock or num-lock.  I've seen things like this
before with netscape (my system is almost identical to yours) but I
thought it a fluke...

Subject: Re: FVWM: the background


Hi,

So, the first thing I would say is that there are many ways to deal with
this.  First of all, if you want to modify one of the .m4 files in
/etc/X11/AnotherLevel, copy it to your home directory and rename it by
adding a "." in front of the name and deleting the ".m4" suffix.  The
reason is if you look at /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4 you will find
this:

define(`readFile', `dnl
syscmd(`test -f $HOME'/.$1)dnl
ifelse(sysval,0,`sinclude(esyscmd(`echo -n $HOME')/.$1)',
`sinclude(ANOTHERLEVEL/$1.m4)')')dnl

This defines an m4 command "readFile" which will first look in your home
directory and then at the default installation for some configuration
file.

eg.

# Now read in some interesting macros...
readFile(`fvwm2rc.macros')

My preference is to use FvwmBacker, xsetroot and xpm files.  So in your
situation I would copy /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.modules.m4 to
~/.fvwm2rc.modules and insert something like this:

##### FvwmBacker
# Set Up Backgrounds for different desktops.
*FvwmBackerDesk 0 Exec xpmroot HOME/tiles/cyan5mra.xpm
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 Exec xpmroot HOME/tiles/pebble_town.xpm

Then I would copy  /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.init.m4 to
~/.fvwm2rc.init and modify it.  You will find something which looks like
this:

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec xsetroot -solid BG_COLOR
...

I would comment out this line (insert a # in front of the +) and add =
this
either before or after it.

+ "I" Module  FvwmBacker

This will start up the FvwmBacker module which will set up the backgroud
for you when you switch desks.  If you want to use xv instead of xpmroot
just change the command in the module configuration file
~/.fvwm2rc.modules for FvwmBacker.

Hello,

I would like to know how I can use fvwm2 (possibly FvwmEvent)
to do the following:

When a window with window name "Netscape: Error" pops up fvwm2
automatically clicks OK for me.

When a window with window name "Netscape: Licence Agreement" pops
up fvwm2 automatically clicks Accept for me. Alternatively,
passing a Return keystroke to the above mentioned nasty netscape
windows would also do.

I tried the following but it did not work (I did not find the
FvwmEvent man page as clear as the other pages).

Module FvwmEvent
*FvwmEvent "Netscape: Error" Destroy

???

Thanks,

Neil

  this one should only pop-up when you run netscape for the very first
time, why would you need fvwm automatically click it for you?

  you might want to use Close, Destroy kills the netscape (all windows).

  also, use FvwmIdent (IIRC) to identify the window that you want to
close.

Thanks for your feedback.

What is this WindowID stuff? If WindowID is a keyword then
it should be showing up either in the fvwm2 man page or in
the FvwmEvent man page but it is not. On the other hand
it cannot be a parameter since window ID's seem to vary
from time to time. So, what does WindowID do?

Also, on line 2, do you mean *FvwmEvent add_window winame_event?

Thanks,

Neil

Ah, I searched for WindowID but the man page lists WindowId.
While Fvwm2 is not case sensitive my man page reader is.
I should have expected that.

Thanks,

Thanks for your feedback...

So I solved part of my problem with the following:

Module FvwmEvent
*FvwmEventPassID
*FvwmEvent add_window AddWindowFunc

AddToFunc AddWindowFunc 
+       "I" WindowID $0 ("Netscape: Error") Close

...

However this does not get me past the License agreement.
If I had included the following:

+       "I" WindowID $0 ("Netscape: License Agreement") Close

The License Agreement comes up each time I delete everything
under ~/.netscape and I do this on a regular basis since this
seems to be the only way I can keep netscape working the right
way each time (I really don't like its caching policies).

So, what I would like to be able to do is have fvwm2 send the
licence agreement an enter keystroke automatically. Is this
possible? This would also be handy for handling other tedious
forms of similar nature.

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

Is there also a way I can make windows invisible? This would be
handy for windows that pop up for half a second and are automatically
closed.

Thanks,

Neil

You can tune netscapes caching by using Edit/Preferences, clicking the
arrow by Advanced and the clicking Cache. Deleting everything under
.netscape is a bit severe and will slow down netscape's startup as it
will generate all those files each time.

Cheers,
Tim.

I use 

Style whatever StartsOnPage -1, SkipMapping, WindowListSkip,
StartsOnPageIncludesTransients

and since the pager displays only desks 0..3 I don't see them.

Did you find links with patches for FVWM, implementing vertical titles?
You can send us these broken links, although I doubt such patches exist.

  do just rm -r ~/.netscape/cache/*

  at least that's working for me. you can also selectively delete other
info - history, newsgroups etc. you don't have to delete everything,
that way you don't loose all your preferences and you are not bothered
by licence agreement.

  I found out that the cache limit for netscape does not work, whatever
you specify, the cache seems to grow (I specified 5 MB and often the
cache would grow to 20+ MB before I "rm -r"-ed it).

  sorry, can't answer your main question but the above might help you a
bit anyway...

Perhaps "patch" was the wrong word to use.
Here is the URL of the original message I found in the archives:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/9603/msg00302.html

There were a string of follow-up messages, one of which stated Jarl's home
page...the link is, of course, dead, and the message is dated 1996.  The
part of the message that caught my eye was this:
"I've made a patch to give vertical titlebars to fvwm windows. You can get
it at my homepage, I even put a snapshot up."
Sounds like what I was looking for.  Oh well.

Thanks for your response...

I know this isnt the netscape list....but i just set disk-caching to 0.
Netscrap caching doesnt work anyway.

I tried IE5 on Solaris.....but it ammoyingly keeps ducking to the bottom
and i must NoIcon or fvwm will complain....and theres no "Images" button.

There is some Gnome compliance in the beta releases.

As I already mentioned this does not work very well for me and neither
do some other Netscape things. Hopefully these will be fixed in 6.0
although I doubt that any web browser will ever be bug free.

What preferences? I cannot even set the highlight color from when I
search for something or higlight colors with the mouse. So when I
search for something I cannot see the higlighted text because of
that default dim yellow! That's the end of my complaining about Netscape.

Hi,

I have installed Linux 6.1 onto my Toshiba Satellite 2545XCDT
laptop and decided I also wanted fvwm as my x-windows environment.
I have successfully installed fvwm 2.2.4 onto the laptop.
This is my first experience installing Linux and fvwm.
Although I've had some Unix experience, I've never been
a sys admin.

I have looked through the /docs directory of the fvwm installation and
searched through the archives of www.fvwm.org and I'm still stumped.

I am using tcsh. I setup the display environment variable
with the command:

   setenv DISPLAY :0.0

(tcsh doesn't have an export command).

When I try "fvwm" or "fvwm2", I get the error message:

   _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect : Can't connect : errno = 111
   [FVWM][main]: <<ERROR>> can't open display :0.0

>From this I can conclude either my laptop LCD display is not
supported or I'm doing something wrong with setting up the
display. What else do I need to do???

Please be very specific in commands, filenames and directories
as this is my first installation of Linux and fvwm.
What may be "obvious" to you may not be obvious to me.

(For example, it wasn't obvious to me you had to type
"fvwm" or "fvwm2" to start up fvwm. It wasn't documented anywhere.
These things "everyone knows" is not obvious for a Linux beginner
like me.)

Also, please reply to directly to me as I am NOT subscribed
to your mailing list currently. 

Thanks,

  Al, awong@primenet.com

Hi,

Have you started X?  How are you loging in, through a X login interface
such as xdm or gdm, or are you loging in through a text prompt and typing
startx.

I've dabbled with fvwm 2.2.3 in place of dtwm on my Sun workstation, but
have gone back to dtwm for the simple reason that the Copy and Paste keys
work right out of the box.  Can anyone tell me how I might go about getting
these Sun-keyboard specific keys working in fvwm2?  These keys also have the
advantage in CDE that they apply to some sort of auxilary cutbuffer, or
whatever the correct terminology is (I'm no GUI programmer).

Copy and Paste work for me, (for example in XEmacs).

Which windows do you expect Copy and Paste to work in?

If you  have  fvwm starting  xterms, you might  want to  have it start
dtterms instead.

I have a problem with a code.  This code has a series of GUI screens that
you input values into little boxes in that screen.   I was wondering if I
could move in one of those screens through each little input box with FVWM
and input values of my choice.  Please let me know if this or something else
can be used for this application.

I'm mainly concerned about xterm, but I take back part of what I said.
The last time I ran fvwm on the Sun box was a couple of months ago, but I
didn't get around to asking the list until now.  I may have upgraded my
xterm in the interim, because now the keys perform the same action as
mouse copying and pasting.

I suppose this is really an xterm question after all, so this may be the
wrong place to ask, but I will anyway.  What I notice is that dtterm has
the ability, in fvwm as well as CDE, to hold different text in the buffer
used for the Copy key after the mouse buffer has been replaced with newer
text.  If anyone out there knows how this is done, I'd appreciate knowing
the secret.

I'd do this if I could put up with dtterm for any length of time, but I
can't, it's just not as configurable.

This may sound like a silly question but how do I use xrdb to add the
resource. Is it possible to add the resource on the command line?
If not then can I put it in my ~/.Xdefaults or must I put it in the
Netscape.ad file?

Thanks,

We're wandering pretty far off-topic here, but what the heck. Recent
versions of netscape (>4.07?) will not respect the X resources
database. All resource customizations must be made in the applications
default file.

You would be better off just setting $DISPLAY to ":0".

OK.

Its impossible for us to tell which of the above would get executed,
since we don't know which of these files exist.

The "echo fvwm2" part doesn't make much sense.

It doesn't seem like you would want to start a background window manager
at this point, based on the stuff done later on.

I suggest deleting the whole section.

Since I don't know if you have a $HOME/.openwin-init,
I can't tell what this section might do.
The "else" part seems OK.

Weak security, but thats up to you.

If you did get this  far, executing fvwm2 would be  the last thing you
did in your  .xinitrc, and you would  be  using the window  manager to
keep your X Session active.  If you correctly exited fvwm, then your X
session would end.

Try removing the piece above.

Err, should it be an exec fvwm2? I've always understood X startup to
prefer to exec the window manager as the final system call.

exec is better. It eliminates an unnecessary process.

I don't think that not using exec would cause a hang.

This is off topic, but may be of general interest.  Any followups
should be taken off the list.

In X you have the clipboard and the selection (I'm ignoring cut
buffers since they're not relevant to the discussion and I don't know
enough about them anyway :-).  The Copy and Paste (and Cut for some
applications) keys work with the clipboard, the all-mouse select and
paste (usually with left button and middle button respectively) use
the primary selection.  Somewhere there's a secondary selection but I
don't think I've ever found anything that used it.  xterm used to only
know about the selection, but it's been clipboard aware for quite some
time now.  However, I see what I think you're talking about.  I did a
little experiment.  I ran xterm and xclipboard, which I believe is
standard with most X environments.  xclipboard lets you manage several
clipboards, exactly one of which is active at any time.  In my xterm
window I selected some text with the mouse.  When I pressed the Copy
key the text showed up in the xclipboard window.  When I pressed
Paste, the text from the clipboard was pasted into the file I was
editing.  All well and good.  Then I selected some different text.  I
did not press Copy.  The xclipboard window was unchanged.  I just
pressed Paste.  The newly selected text ended up in the file instead
of the clipboard.  So xterm is doing something weird on the Paste key.
If it finds a primary selection it uses that, otherwise the clipboard.
According to the xterm man page on my Solaris 7 system, this must mean
that the Paste key is bound to insert-selection(PRIMARY,CLIPBOARD)
(see the ACTIONS section) or something similar as there may be other
sources checked either before or after the clipboard.  So you should
be able to set up an XTerm translation resource that binds the Paste
key to insert-selection(CLIPBOARD,PRIMARY).  Something like this:

*.VT100.Translations: #override \n\
<Key>SunPaste: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD,PRIMARY)

Hi!

I want to use SloppyFocus, but I also want the focus to be given automatically to a new window when it appears (perhaps move the curser to that window?). How can I achieve this?

  Thanks, Stefan

Does anyone know if there is a style setting I can use to specify a window's 
position at start up?  I have searched through the man page and didn't see 
anything.  I have a program that does not process X command line arguments, 
like "-geometry", so I am hoping I can get fvwm2 to put it in the right place 
when it launches.  Is this possible?

Thanks for your time.

"Move" line is not needed, it is the answer to NancySumner1 question.
I will add this to FAQ.

Thanks!

BTW, is there a way that I can add a resource with xrdb by
specifying a resource or a list of resources on the command
line rather than a file?

Thanks,

Neil

  I disagree; IIUC, anything set up globally (as in .Xdefaults using xrdb)
is always passed in full to every application that starts. It seems a bit
of a waste of time passing every app.'s defaults to a new app. that only
cares about it's own.

  There seems to be a few ways of doing it on an app. by app. basis, but
the one that seems to work best (and is supported by most apps., inc.
xterm & netscape) is to setenv XAPPLRESDIR to $HOME/usr/lib/app-defaults
or some such, it being a directory, and put in there defaults files for
each application (the files, I think, must have the correct resource class
name). The contents of my app-defaults, for example, are:

/home/nabird/usr/lib/app-defaults:
Bclock        Clock         Dtcm          Emacs         Emacs.old 
Netscape      Olwm          Raplayer      Rxvt          Teamwork 
Vncviewer     WIO           XClock        XDbx          XKeyCaps 
XScreenSaver  XTerm         XTicker       Xmag          


  You only need include those things you want to change (e.g., for
Netscape). And you need to set up XAPPLRESDIR before WM startup, otherwise
it won't be there for app.s started from the WM.

  Of course, if you find an app. that doesn't play ball, and look for it's
defaults there, you'll have to put the values into .Xdefaults. Mine only
contains 12 lines, with default colours, locale, etc.

  (warning: when using this method, *technically* you may omit preceeding
application-class strings (e.g., you can do '*color:' safely, instead of
having to do 'XTicker*color'), but xterm has it's own defaults parser
which ignores any lines not beginning with the correct classname (usually
XTerm/xterm)).


> BTW, is there a way that I can add a resource with xrdb by

  echo 'App*Resource: value' | xrdb -merge

  Should work; you may want to set up an alias for that.

Thanks to both you and Mikhael for responding to my question.  I have tried 
to use both of your suggestions and can't seem to get them to work.  
Wondering if you might have any ideas as to what I am doing wrong?

When I used your code (above) I got the following error:
"FvwmEvent: incomplete event definition *FvwmEventPassID"

I am using version 2.2.4 of fvwm2 and FvwmEvent.  

When I tried Mikhael's suggestion:
----------------------
*NewWindowEventCmd
*NewWindowEventPassId
*NewWindowEvent add_window FuncFocusWindow

AddToFunc FuncFocusWindow
+ I WindowId $0 ("My Special Window") Move 200p 100p
+ I WindowId $0 Focus
+ I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow

FvwmEvent NewWindowEvent
-----------------------
I didn't get any errors, but the window was not moved.  I am wondering if I 
may have an older version that doesn't support some of these event calls or 
something?  I read the man page over and over and checked my code for typos a 
bunch - can't seem to figure it out.  

Any suggestions are appreciated - and thanks again to both of you for your 
responses.

You are right, PassId option of FvwmEvent was introduced only in 2.3.
And in FvwmEvent 2.2.4 there is no alias support, only symlinks, so you
normally can only have one event module if you use this version.

It is possible to invent an example working with 2.2.4, but it may be
less relable. Replace "My Window" with your real window name.

# ----------------
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent add_window SetGeometryForMyWindow

AddToFunc SetGeometryForMyWindow
+ I Next ("My Window") Move 200p 100p

# choose one of 2 invocations (the second is preferable)
Module FvwmEvent
#AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent
# ================

This works with 2.3.20 and should work with 2.2.4, I hope.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Why doesn't the following work?

AddToFunc AddResource "I" Exec echo $0 | /usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb -merge
AddToFunc InitFunction "I" AddResource "Netscape*selectBackground: #FFFF66"

On the other hand the following did work:

AddToFunc AddResource
[...]
+ "I" Exec echo "Netscape*selectBackground: #FFFF66" | /usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb
-merge

You just need a little more quoting to stop the "#" fomr being interpreted
by the shell as a comment.

This works:

AddToFunc AddResource "I" Exec echo "$0" | /usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb -merge

What's the recommended way of starting whatever calls fvwm?

I'm on Solaris 2.5.1 that boots to a "dos prompt", not the winmanager
selection menu. I dont want CDE, just the basics required run fvwm2.

Right now (for histerical reasons)I have this chain of events.
fvwm2 is started from a .xinitrc.
Notice the 25MB /usr/openwin/bin/X elephant.

I think the "xinit" method is the simplest way to go, one advantage
being it can be understood by ordinary mortals.

Heres something from the Solaris FAQ that may explain the size of the
X Server:

5.50) Why is Xsun such a memory pig, especially on the SX, S24 and FFB?

    Ps counts the mappings for the framebuffer as memory.
    Especially on the FFB where a number of different mappings
    of the device address space is used to optimize
    access this can cause large amounts of memory, but not
    physical memory, to be mapped and shown by ps.

    It's not unusual for the FFB+ (Creator3D) to show a 500MB
    process size for the X server.

    Solaris 2.3 FCS also has a number of Xsun memory leaks when using
    the SX.  Get the SX patches or upgrade to a later release of
    Solaris 2.x.

    /usr/proc/bin/pmap (new in 2.5) will show the exact mappings used
    by Xsun.  "pmap -x" (new in 2.6) will even show how much of each
    mapping is shared/private resident, etc.  If Xsun has a memory leak,
    you'll see a huge "[heap]" with pmap.

Hi,

Thanks for your comment. There are so many special symbols and ways to

Hi, you can create a keyboard shortcut to move to 
a different window within a desktop, can you assign
a keystroke to move to a different desktop? 

Thanks

Hi,

I want to achieve the following:

When the right mouse button is pressed over a button in FvwmIconMan,
a menu pops up, giving access to operations on the window.

Anyone has an idea of how to achieve this.

I succeeded in popping up a menu, but the menu items did not apply to
the window corresponding with the pressed FvwmIconMan button.

Greetings,
Eric

The syntax is (menu position hints, i.e. last 3 words, are optional):

*FvwmIconMan*action Mouse 3 N sendcommand "Popup WindowOps2 Mouse c -102m"

But there is a bug you described. It is fixed in the developement version.

Hi,

I am using in my .fvwm2rc :

AddToFunc CurrentRaiseWarp I Current (!Visible) Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 16p

AddToFunc GoToLast I Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

AddToFunc WasActive I DestroyFunc GoToLast
+ I AddToFunc GoToLast I Nop

AddToFunc LastActive I Current (CurrentPage !Iconic) Function WasActive
+ I Function GoToLast
+ I Current (CurrentPage !Iconic) Function CurrentRaiseWarp
+ I DestroyFunc GoToLast
+ I AddToFunc GoToLast I Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

AddToFunc WarpToNew I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 16p

*FvwmEventPassID
*FvwmEventDelay 0
*FvwmEventCmd Function
*FvwmEvent add_window WarpToNew
*FvwmEvent destroy_window LastActive

to obtain focus to any new created window and get focus to last active one
while current active is deleted. First works ok for me but second does not.
I observe that before event is activated the window under the pointer 
position is focused (it's not the last active one in this case)
so list order is changed and then event function is useless. 
I am using SloppyFocus.
Strange because it worked properly in 2.2.4 version.

Regards

Sorry to junk if not interested.

I have just made a new realease of AnotherLevelUp (a much improved version of
Red Hat's AnotherLevel fvwm2 configuration, with persistent user options and
themes).

See:    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU

Main new feature: an automatic favourites menu.

Thanks, John Latham
