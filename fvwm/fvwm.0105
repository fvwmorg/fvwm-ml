Greeting and most joyous jubilations!

Re: FVWM2 FAQ Question 3.3

It was with great satisfaction that I found a satisfactory
solution to the Alt-Tab solution.

Description: Alt-Tab should change the focus to the next
  window and raise it to the top. When modified with Shift,
  behaviour should be the same, with the exception of the
  previous window being the subject of the change.
    No window list is displayed. On each Alt-Tab event, the
  next window is brought into focus and raised. This behaivour
  traverses desktops by default, though I dear suggest that
  this could be contained with a condition. As an extra, Ctrl-Tab
  could switch between desktops, ala KDE.
    I have tried this with SloppyFocus and ClickToFocus, with
  success.

Solution:

(original lines commented out)
#Key Tab         A       MS     Prev Focus
Key Tab         A       MS      Function "shift-alt-tab"
#Key Tab         A       M      Next Focus
Key Tab         A       M       Function "alt-tab"

#
# This will create M$-Windows Alt-Tab behaivour. The next window
# will be brought into focus and raised to the top.
#
DestroyFunc "alt-tab"
AddToFunc "alt-tab"          "I" Next ( CurrentDesk CurrentPage ) Focus
+                            "I" Current Raise
DestroyFunc "shift-alt-tab"
AddToFunc "shift-alt-tab"    "I" Prev ( CurrentDesk CurrentPage ) Focus
+                            "I" Current Raise

Note that this is from a Slackware 7.1 installation.

Current Limitations:
  It would be nice for Alt-Tab to go to the last window I was
  in, rather than go in a circular loop. Any suggestion for making
  the old current window the the next Next window?

PS: May have found a performance bug.

AddToFunc "alt-tab" "I" Next ( CurrentPage CurrentDesk ) Focus
+                   "I" Current Raise

Is nice and speedy.

AddToFunc "alt-tab"
+                   "I" Next ( CurrentPage CurrentDesk ) Focus
+                   "I" Current Raise

Is considerably slower.

This is with Fvwm2.2.4

PPS. Congrats on a nice WM and great docs!

Hi

I can't get Alt-tab to cycle through windows properly.

I set:

Key Tab         A       M       Next (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus

(or even when I simply put * as the condition)

Pressing Alt-Tab multiple times does not cycle through the windows list.
It stops with the last one.

When I replace Focus with FlipFocus I get the same behaviour.

I use fvwm 2.2.5, built on solaris 7, run on solaris 8.

I tried using sample/new-features as my .fvwm2rc , to make sure the
problem is not with my original .fvwm2rc (which is originally from a
fvwm2.0.42 copy, with a long history) .

Any ideas? What should I check?

Subject: FVWM: New problems since 2.3.6

Hi,

For some time, I have been using fvwm 2.3.6 built under Cygwin on Windows
NT/2K with the Exceed 6.2 X-server (multi-window mode). I recently upgraded
to the latest version (2.3.31). First let me congratulate you on a perfect
build: it compiled and ran out of the box with no errors, the new sample-95
configuration procedure ran like a dream, and a number of problems I had
become accustomed to with the old version are now cured. Unfortunately a few
new ones (not in fvwm 2.3.6) seem to have crept in:-

1) I use ClickToFocus. This mostly works correctly with X and native windows
together, but if the active X-window is behind a native window, it is raised
if the cursor moves over it (rather like MouseFocus). I tried turning on
BugOpts RaiseOverNativeWindows, but this doesn't seem to make any difference
(I guess it's switched on automatically). As one might expect, turning it
off prevents X-windows being raised over the native window at all (even by a
click).

2) Deiconising or switching to a window (by menu or taskbar) does an
annoying full screen refresh. This doesn't happen when the window is
selected by just clicking on it.

3) In my FvwmButtons (edited a little to conform to the new syntax) I have
buttons like

     *BarButtons(Title XTerm, Icon rterm.xpm, Action `Exec "XTerm" exec
xterm`)

which I think should mean that the button remains shown as depressed until
the XTerm window appears (this is what used to happen). Now the button is
only shown depressed as long as mouse button is down. Is this a new bug, or
am I using the wrong syntax?

Thanks,
Tim.

Are you sure? Is this a known problem that was fixed somewhere?

I think that this problem is a bit to obvious to have been missed if it
had affected every user. So I figure that it is a more spesific problem.
Therefore the fact that it works fine for someone does not mean that an
upgrade will solve the problem (not to mention that it may introduce other
problems).

Building another version is a bit of a complicated operation. I'd like to
see if there aren't any better suggestions.

Also, someone remarked that I set:

Key Tab         A       M       Next (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev (!Iconify CurrentScreen) Focus

but the last line should have had MS instead of SM . Is that correct? If
so: Is that docuemnted anywhere? I've tried changing that, and the problem
is not yet solved.

Thanks, anyway.

BTW: I got the error: '*FvwmTaskBar: cannot open console' . It appears
that the attempt to open /dev/console is indeed wrapped by NO_CONSOLE, but
NO_CONSOLE is not defined anywhere (even not in a remmed-out #define in
the beginning of FvwmTaskBar.c, and nothing in the toplevel config.h)

A problem I have with the taskbar is that the start button remains
depressed after the first time I press it (actually I use the task-bar
mainly as a windows list). 

One other thing regarding the taskbar: (I didn't bother checking if this
wasn't already fixed elsewhere): the pasrsing of the "FvwmTaskBarMailbox"
parameter is wrong: in extra/FvwmTaskBar/Goodies.c:GoodiesParseConfig(),
the length of "Mailbox" is assumed to be 11, while it is 7.

GodiesParseConfig also forgets to remove the newline char from the end of
the config line. Thus the mailbox path get parsed as
"/path/to/mailbox<NL>"

Personally for me this module seems quite handy as a windows list and a
mail notification/clock. I like the same settings in IceWM as well.

We like all replies to go back to fvwm@fvwm.org.  You should have been
able to respond to me, but stuff happens.

Perhaps I wasn't clear.

In the  latest betas, there is  a  built in alt-tab  key  binding.  It
brings  up a   menu (windowlist) using   the new  "select on  release"
feature that lets  you hold down alt,  and keep pressing tab until you
get to the line you want.  When  you release the  keys, the window you
are on   in the  menu is  selected.    If you keep  pressing  tab, the
selection wraps from the bottom of the menu to the  top.  If you press
alt-tab-tab the previous window is selected.  If you iconify a window,
and press alt-tab the iconified window is selected.

In short, its perfect, and you don't have to put anything in your config
file.  Just like the original.

Hmm, we don't think its that hard.  We do have RPMs available.

I don't know, it doesn't seem to me like a good thing to use anyway.
Maybe someone else knows more about this if you really want to
go that way.

I don't use the TaskBar but I'm pretty sure this module recieved a lot
of attention in the recent betas.

Does   clicking  on the  titlebar  vs.  clicking   in  the window  act
differently?  Have you looked at the various "ClickRaises" options?

I don't see this.  Are you using some kind of function to deiconify that
includes a refresh?

I'm not sure, but it looks like there too many execs after action.

I have no problem with editing config files. I put a special "config"
button in my Buttons to open .fvwm2rc .

OK. I downloaded,, compiled, copied it from the build machine, and ran it. 

There are some nice improvements. But the size has increased.

The windows list does not strike me as a good default: it lacks an
indication of whether the window is minimized, for instance. 

The "select on release" does not appear to be working.

When I press Enter I get the message:

  [FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'WindowListFunc'

and nothing happens.

After I added the definition of WindowListFunc from ConfigFvwmDefaults all
I needed was to press enter.

And anyway, the original problem was not resolved: When I set my original
mapping of Alt-Tab, it still won't cycle through the list of windows: it
only advances in the list, and won't advance beyond the last window in the
list.

Is this a bug with me or is it a feature and I'm not reading the man page
correctly?

Yep, sorry.  On my Solaris machine its still reasonable.

The geometry of the window should be shown in parenthesis.

When the build takes place the final location of ConfigFvwmDefaults gets
builtin to fvwm.  If you don't do a make install, and instead copy just
the binaries, you might get the symptom of WindowListFunc not defined.

I don't see what else could be missing, but perhaps if you fix the
problem with ConfigFvwmDefaults, selectonrelease will start working.

I'm not sure what you mean about the enter key.  The selectonrelease
stuff will only work with the alt-tab combination.

alt-tab will cycle thru the window list menu, when it reaches the end,
it cycles back to the beginning.  Isn't that what you want?

Oops.  So many questions come in with the assumption that we know
they are using Linux.  I'm a die hard Solaris user too.

Well, its not that hard for Solaris either.  Use --prefix if you
aren't root.  It can be installed anywhere.

Hi Dan,

Thanks for the message.

> Does   clicking  on the  titlebar  vs.  clicking   in  the window  act
> differently?

No, they do the same thing: clicking in window or titlebar both raise the
window as one would like (in fact this is one of the improvements since
2.3.6, which often didn't raise the window if one only clicked in the
window). The problem is that 2.3.31 is too eager to raise the window: when
the active X-window is behind a native window, it is raised even if the
cursor just passes through it. This is only a problem with the active
window, and only when a native window is in front (when there's just
X-windows involved it all works perfectly). Unfortunately this behaviour can
make fvwm nearly unusable, as a small native window in front of a large
X-window becomes nearly inaccessible as it's always pushed back when one
tries to get at it.

> Have you looked at the various "ClickRaises" options?

All the ones I could find: as well as ClickToFocus, I normally have
ClickToFocusPassesClick, ClickToFocusRaises, and MouseFocusClickRaises
enabled, but I tried turning them off with no luck - though maybe there's a
magic combination I've missed.

Not that I can tell. I'm using the sample-95 setup with a few edits. For
example, I have

*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
AddToFunc DeiconifyFocusAndRaise I Iconify off
+                                I Focus
+				         I Raise

I tried removing the second exec, but that didn't help. I use the second
exec to prevent the shell process hanging around unnecessarily.

These still look like bugs. Should I add them to the bug tracking system?

Thanks,
Tim.

FvwmButtons does not have the functionality you describe.  You
are probably confusing this with the 'Swallow' option.

I want to swallow a date-app, similar to the app in the cde
panel, into my FvwmButtons panel. So far I couldn't find a
suitable app for this. wmdate looked promising but it somehow
doesn't like being swallowed. it's always displayed in a separate
window. Does someone know a date app? (No, I don't want xclock in
digital mode. I already swallowed xclock in a separate button)

Cheers
Martin

The only clock like app I see in the CDE panel is dtcm in its iconic
state.  You should be able to get FvwmButtons to swallow that.

If I did want to have a button bar with a clock in it on my desktop,
I would use "asclock".  I found it at the Afterstep site.

I've updated the FAQ.  It now shows the current direction we
are taking with alt-tab.

I wasn't aware that the "Missing I" problem was in 2.2.4, but
I know its been fixed in the latest betas.

As I remember this bug, when the first line of the function was
empty, it was waiting for the double click timeout (or something
like that).

On behalf of all the fvwm-workers, thanks.

Great work,

Just Downloaded and installed the 1.3.1 cygwin tools on my NT box.
Used the setup.exe utility from cygwin.com's web page for the base
install
and the included bzip2 and tar to install the cygwin xfree86 4.0.3
binaries.
Created a /etc/X11/xserver directory to put the included xfree86
SecurityPolicy in.
Tweaked  /etc/passwd to use /bin/bash and  $HOME/.bash_profile PATH to
include /usr/X11R6/bin.

The only real problem I noticed was no familiar window managers.

I decided it couldn't hurt so I downloaded fvwm-2.3.31.
Ran ./configure expecting tons of problems, but to my surprise configure
completed
even with missing dnet dnet-stub rplay stroke ipc.

I then did a make, and once again to my surprise, success!.
make install.

Unpacked the fvwm_icons into /usr/share/icons.

Reduced my .xserverrc to just:
#!/bin/bash
Xwin -screen 0 1024x768x16

Reduced my .xinitrc to just:
#!/bin/bash
fvwm2

Did a startx  from the bash shell and SUCCESS!
Left clicked on the mouse, went to settings, started FVWM Configuration
added
/usr/share/icons to path and restarted fvwm.

Looks Good.

Thanks for a fun day.

The Problem with dtcm is that I don't have CDE installed :( I'm
trying to mimic the look of a CDE Desktop on my fvwm system.
(fvwm-themes looks good but is way too complex for me. So I just
take the good ideas. *g*)

I searched a bit for asclock but it seems that it always displays
the time. :(

If that's true, it must have been removed recently. It used to do this in
2.3.6, and it's still in the (2.3.31) FvwmButtons man page:-

               Any fvwm command  is  recognized  by  FvwmButtons.
               See  fvwm2(1)  for more infomation.  The Exec com-
               mand has a small extension when used  in  Actions,
               its syntax is:

                 Exec ["hangon"] command

               When FvwmButtons finds such an Exec  command,  the
               button remains pushed in until a window whose name
               or class matches the quoted portion of the command
               is encountered. This is intended to provide visual
               feedback to  the  user  that  the  action  he  has
               requested will be performed. If the quoted portion
               contains no characters, then the button  will  pop
               out  immediately.   Note  that  users can continue
               pressing the button, and re-executing the command,
               even when it looks "pressed in."

I rather liked this functionality, but I agree that it's not a critical
feature. If it was decided to remove it (when did that happen - I didn't
notice it in the news?), then I guess the documentation should be updated.

In any case, this is just a minor quibble (sorry if I'm too much of a
pedant). My main problems are the spurious window raising and full-screen
refresh that I mentioned in my original message.

Thanks,
Tim.

Hello,

to start off with some praise: xine is brilliant software and it works great 
for me - so is fvwm2 ;)

However - these two don't work together. Whenever I start xine, it exits 
as soon as it begins playing a Movie. With any other wm (I've tried a lot
of them, including old versions of fvwm2) it works just fine. And that only
happens when playing back via XFree4's XV-extension.

My machine is a P-III 450, 256M RAM, Matrox G200
XFree4.0.1, fvwm-2.3.3{0,2}, xine-0.4.{01,2} (I've tested both).
I'm running GNOME on a Mandrake-7.2 Distribution.

I've had a look into the source, however I don't know about X-Programming, so 
I couldn't even track the problem down to either fvwm or xine, so I posted 
this on both lists.
I have added the xine output, and if that helps I have the output produced
by strace online at 
http://gargamel.weh.rwth-aachen.de/xine/DestroyNotify.strace

Thanks for any help,

Felix

More than likely its a xine issue, but I couldn't access that URL.

Hi,

	Is there a way to drag a window just pressing a combination of a key and 
mouse, like windowmaker or kde? I mean, in kde you can press alt and then 
drag a window clicking in any place of the window, without have to click only 
in the border or title bar.

	Thanks in advance

Yep, I have:
Mouse 1 WTFSI M Move 

which means the first mouse button, anywhere in the window, with the meta
key, move the window.

read the fvwm2 manpage.

Of course there is.

This may happen if you have some window on your way, like xclock, which
does not accept focus and thus breaking the circulation, use:

  Style xclock CirculateSkip

BTW, it should be "Iconic" condition not "Iconify", also there is no 
"CurrentScreen" condition, but "CurrentDesk" or "CurrentPage".

The order (MS vus SM) does not matter.

I think this problem was fixed several months ago in betas.

Ok, then you already have fvwm-themes installed, it enhances your fvwm
instalation even if you don't use it. Try the following from FvwmConsole:

  FvwmScript FvwmApplet-Day
  FvwmScript FvwmApplet-DayClock
  FvwmScript FvwmApplet-DigitalClock

If you use colorsets, you may also give 2 colorset numbers as parameters.

Other 64x64 applets (including Date/Time) as candidates for swallowing:

It is in /usr/local/share/fvwm/FvwmApplet-Day; currently there are no many
options, you may manually change font/color/position for widgets 2 and 4.

Perfect! That's what I wanted. :) Where is this applet defined?
(I did a quick rgrep though /usr/local/share/fvwm/themes/). Or
how can I adjust the font of the applet?

I too agree that it was VERY useful and would certainly vote to
have it be reinstated (its the correct intuitive thing to see).
I consider the lack of a "pushed-in" visual a bug; as a compromise
could a flag be introduced to result in that visual ?

Thanks and keep up the great work.

It can be any window, including an xterm and FvwmButtons . It is simply
the last on the list. The strange thing is that a mouse press does seem to
modify the order of the list.

Pressing the first mouse button on the title is bound to the function
Move-or-Raise, which is:
AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "M" Move
+                         "M" Raise
+                         "C" Raise
+                         "D" Maximize 100 100

I can't check more at the moemnt, sorry.

That's nice. Is there any "compiler" or such to check for irrelevant
conditions?

My sanity-check tools are the error messages sent by fvwm at load time,
and the syntax hilighting of vim . Apart from that I'm quite lost when
having to debug something.

Hello,

I'm a long time fvwm user, and as I started to use mozilla, I'm facing 
annoy problem: sometimes, when mozilla opens a popup window, that window 
does not show fvwm buttons 1. 4 and 2 (exactly the ones I use).

That's very annoy, because I can't close the window with 1 click (which 
is bound to my button 1). I  worked-around this pbm by adding the same 
action to button 3, but now I  have an unecessary button in all other 
applications, but I am curious to know the reason/solution of the problem.

I don't know if that is a fvwm or mozilla pbm (I believe in the 2nd 
option :), but I didn't find any mention to it anywhere (not even in the 
mailing list: 
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/w3glimpse/fvwm?query=mozilla&errors=0&maxfiles=50&maxlines=10). 

The sample code below reproduces the problem:

--- test.html ----
<html>
<head>
<title>test</title>
<script language="javascript">
function popup() {
       var url="test.html";
       var opts = 
"toolbar=no,status=no,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=no,height=320,width=490,scrollbars=yes";
       closer = window.open("", "CloserLook", opts);
       closer.focus();
       closer.location = url;
  }
</script>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<a href="javascript:popup()">popup</a>
</body>
</html>

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Felipe

This is question 3.12 in the FAQ.  The FAQ mentions Netscape, but
Mozilla does the same things.

I already have that defined, and it works fine with netscape 4.x and 
konqueror. It just doesn't work with mozilla/netscape 6. Besides, all 
other buttons work. It's really weird...

(I could send my .fvwm2rc, if necessary)

That worked, thanks (I was using MWMDecor before).

I didn't find any mention about it at the docs or man page, though 
(there is a good explanation about MWMDecor, but nothing about NoDecorHint).

Thanks again,

Felipe

Hello,

I don't know whether or not this qualifies as a bug but here it is:

1 - I start up some xterms with "xterm -T TITLE".
2 - As soon as the xterms are launched the shell changes their title.
3 - When I iconize the xterms they still use the same icon as the
    Icon specified with "Style TITLE myicon.xpm" in the config file.
4 - After restarting the icons appear different (the DefaultIcon is
    displayed instead)

Now is this something that should be fixed in one way or another?

Other than that the latest release 2.3.31 works just fine!
Good work!

Neil

This is a normal behaviour. After restart FVWM has no knowledge that the
original title was TITLE. The window title is taken as of time when a new
restarted fvwm captures xterm, i.e. the dynamically changed title.

I don't think that this behaviour should be changed, in one cases you
want to use in Style the original title in others the dynamical title.
The rule is: don't rely on title text if it is changed dynamically.

Start your xterms using "xterm -name TITLE" instead of "xterm -T TITLE",
in this case dynamical title changes still leave TITLE resource name.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The problem is that there are no irrelevant conditions.  When fvwm
encounters a string that does not match any of the predefined
tokens in a condition, it is taken as the name/class/resource of a
window.  In the case of the lines above fvwm has looked for
windows with the title "!Iconify" (and has silently ignored the
CurrentScreen part).  So the correct lines are

  Key Tab A M  Next (!Iconic CurrentPage) Focus
  Key Tab A MS Prev (!Iconic CurrentPage) Focus

(or CurrentDesk instead of CurrentPage).

I searched up and down the code but I can't find any way how
simply moving the pointer over the focused window could trigger
raising or lowering windows.  You said that turning of the
RaiseOverNativeWindows option 'fixes' the problem.  This proves
that the RaiseOrLowerWindow() function is called when the pointer
enters the window because it is the only place where the option is
evaluated.  But fvwm does not call this function.  I can think of
several possible explanations:

 1) Exceed raises the window.  Is there perhaps some setting in
    Exceed for this?
 2) FvwmEvent is doing this.
 3) FvwmAuto is running and configured to do this.
 4) The application raises itself.  This would mean that this
    occurs only for some applications.
 5) Other reasons?

Please post your config file so we can try it out.

Maybe the problem is iconifying animation not working well under Exceed?
You may turn it off in "Settings/Animation".

Dominik, you may try it by running "FvwmScript FvwmScript-Setup95",
.fvwm2rc will be back-upped.

It is basically system.fvwm2rc-sample-95 divided to multiple files.

I've used Exceed quite a bit and I don't see any full screen
refreshes.

There are some settings that might affect this.

I run windows in truecolor mode.  If you don't run in truecolor mode
and a new color is allocated, windows does some colormap balancing
the might look like a full screen refresh.

Under Exceed, Xconfig, Screen Definition, Server Visual I selected
"Auto Select".  You can pick TrueColor or PsuedoColor.  Combined with
the windows setting, a mismatch might cause problems.

Under  Exceed, Xconfig,  Video,  there are  some  Palette options.   I
picked Defer Changes and Optimize To  Reduce Flashing On Focus Change.
I've  also got  Preserve  System Colors  selected, Preallocate  system
colors in default   colormap  selected and  Enable System  Pixels  not
selected.  Since I'm running with TrueColor I don't think these
setting affect me much.

I use FvwmAnimate with the builtin IconBox with no problem.

I don't see one.  I'm using Exceed 6.2.

Using FvwmAuto, Fvwm windows raise over native windows as they should.
Native windows don't raise over Fvwm windows unless you click on an
exposed part (as they should).  Once a native window has focus,
an Fvwm window won't raise over a native window until I click on the
frame, or until I move from one Fvwm window into another.  This makes
some sense, the first fvwm window to get focus doesn't know the native
window is in the way so it has no reason to raise itself.

I don't have any RaiseOverNative settings.

In Windows there is a TweakUI package that changes the focus model
from ClickFocus to PointerFocus.  I had problems with it, so I'm not
using it.  I don't know what that would do.

xine used to work properly with fvwm-2.3.25, Something broke it with 
fvwm >= 2.3.26.

ok, here's what they said (not much). They forwarded me (part of) a discussion
between 2 people from Rational Tech Support:

Betreff: RE: New CaseID: v0763648 -- RoseRT on Unix: MWWM


Hello Rainer,

I've been talking to my colleuges in Kanata and here is a short explanation.

*******************************
Back in RoseRT 6.1 and earlier days, the setting of MWWM to something (mwm
for me) was a workaround for one particular problem but also caused other
problems.  Development stated that "MWWM is a feature that has been
deprecated".  I assume they received this info from MainSoft.  As a result,
our Development asked me (others) to discontinue the use of it and that it
was at that time and for the future to be an unsupported environment.  They
also changed the RoseRT script to enforce this.
*******************************

What kind of problem were the customer having befor they started using the
MWWM variable, and what result got better?


------------------------- snip ---------------------------------------------

that's all I got so far, but I'll try to pester them for more information.

Klaus

Hell, this is *buggy*.  I recommend to report this to the xine
developers.  It doesn't make much sense to adapt the window
manager to cope with applications of this level of quality.  Just
try to drag the setup window across the video window and you know
what I mean.

BTW, it does not crash on my system.

No, I have FvwmAnimate disabled.

I have mostly the same settings. I tried changing the rest (except for
"Enable System  Pixels", which doesn't seem to be in Exceed 6.2), but that
didn't fix the problem.

> I use FvwmAnimate with the builtin IconBox with no problem.

I tried the IconBox with the same result.

I did find one setting that would "solve" the problem: I turned off
FvwmBacker ("Settings | Background | Disable Background"). In fact all the
configurations that I've tried (eg. initial sample-95 settings, even with
MouseFocus) give this spurious screen refresh behaviour with FvwmBacker, and
the correct behaviour when FvwmBacker isn't running.

Of course one would expect the screen refresh when switching desktops, but
I'm getting it when I just select another window on the same desktop (or
even if I have just one desktop).

So, it looks like the bug is in FvwmBacker. Does anyone else see it, or is
it just me?

Thanks,
Tim.

Hello,

I would like to know whether it is possible to have each desktop viewport
display a different background picture. I would guess that at the coding
level this would entail some communication between the window manager and
the running program which displays the picture (in xpm, gif, or other).
The program would pass fvwm a viewport number as a parameter and fvwm
would ensure the picture was displayed in the right place or fvwm could
specify the viewport number to the running program and back. Something
like that.

Thanks!

Neil

So far, its still just you.

I just tried FvwmBacker and I don't notice anything.
I assume FvwmBacker is still configured to use solid colors?

In XConfig, under screens, on the screen 0 tab, when I click
Advanced, I have "Root Mouse Actions to X"
"Track Mouse" is not selected,
and Root Drawing is "background only".

Hi Dan,

Thanks again for your help in trying to track down this problem.

Bum :-(      - for me, anyway :-)

Yup. I use:-

*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page * *) -solid \#3F5469
*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 1, Page * *) -solid purple4
*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 2, Page * *) -solid DarkOliveGreen4
*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 3, Page * *) -solid brown4

but got the same with the sample-95 settings.

I had all of these apart from the last four (and "Accelerated Drawing Mode",
which isn't in my version; I assume you mean "Min Backing store" for this
last one). I tried changing those to no avail.

I wonder whether this isn't an X-server issue, since I don't get the problem
in 2.3.6 (with the same X-server)?

Hi Dominik,

Thanks for looking into my problem.

I wonder whether I could put a debugging message in RaiseOrLowerWindow(), or
somewhere else, to try to verify what is doing this. Would this help? Is
this the best place? (Sorry, it's a long time since I looked at the fvwm
code.)

Not as far as I can tell. Also if I go back to fvwm 2.3.6 (with identical
Exceed settings), I don't have this problem.

I don't use either FvwmEvent or FvwmAuto. In fact I can disable every fvwm
module (ps shows only fvwm2 running) and still see this problem.

I tried various applications, both local (eg. xterm, rclock) and remote (eg.
emacs running from Solaris).

By a process of elimination... :-)

Thanks,
Tim.

My Exceed version is 6.2.0.16 (Help, about).

I'm using W98SE.

Can you give more detail about what the annoying screen refresh looks
like?  What parts of the screen are redrawn.

In modules/FvwmBacker/FvwmBacker.c around line 365, change it to
look like this:

void ProcessMessage(unsigned long type, unsigned long *body)
{
  char *tline;

  switch (type)
  {
  case M_CONFIG_INFO:
    tline = (char*)&(body[3]);
    fprintf(stderr"FvwmBacker: config\n");
    ExecuteMatchingCommands(ParseConfigLine(tline));
    break;

  case M_NEW_DESK:
    current_desk = body[0];
    fprintf(stderr"FvwmBacker: new desk\n");
    ExecuteMatchingCommands(-1);
    break;

  case M_NEW_PAGE:
    current_desk = body[2];
    current_x = body[0]/MyDisplayWidth;
    current_y = body[1]/MyDisplayHeight;
    fprintf(stderr"FvwmBacker: new page\n");
    ExecuteMatchingCommands(-1);
    break;

  }
}

If you don't already know how to look at fvwm's stderr in real time,
start fvwm like this:

fvwm2 2>/tmp/fvwm.out

Then start:

tail -f /tmp/fvwm.out

then iconify a window to see if FvwmBacker is getting commands
during iconification.

Just the same for me.

I'm using Windows 2000 SP1.

Nearly everything, even Windows windows (what a silly name for an OS, eh?).

It's a bit difficult to be sure which aren't being redrawn (maybe it's just
too fast), but I can see that everything on the taskbar, all fvwm border
decorations, FvwmButtons text (but maybe not the icons) are redrawn. Also,
if I have a Windows application up, that is also refreshed (eg. Windows
Netscape reloads its page).

I'll let you know how the debugging goes later (bed time now).

Thanks,
Tim.

I believe someone told me you need Exceed 7.0 for W2000.

If the  Windows  windows are being affected,   I'd suspect  windows is
rebalancing its colormap.  I don't remember your answers when I asked
about the colormaps being used by Windows and Exceed.

Hello, I just downloaded, comp'd, and installed fvwm 2.3.32, so
I could use my scroll wheel on FvwmButtons.

However, I've now got this annoying problem of a default builtin
menu when I scroll on the root window. (I'm using my old config
file).

I've tried removing that pesky thing with

Mouse 0 R A -
Mouse 1 R A -
Mouse 2 R A -
Mouse 3 R A -
Mouse 4 R A -
Mouse 5 R A -
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX

which is similar to what the man page for fvwm2 suggests,
but no such luck. How can this be done?

When I open an "Open Page" or "Search" dialog box in Netscape I would
like the cursor to appear in the text area. There are other examples
as well. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Try

  Mouse 0 R N -

The default binding is

  Mouse 0 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot

To remove a binding the context and modifiers have to match the
original binding command.  What part of the man page do you refer
to?  Is there any outdated or incorrect information in the man
page?

In general, fvwm does not know anything about text input windows
of applications.  Applications do not announce that certain sub
windows are intended to take keyboard input or not.  So, if a
window has several sub windows that take keyboard input there is
no canonical way to warp the pointer to them.  If you only want to
be able to type into such a window, try

  Style * GrabFocusTransient

or for only selected windows:

  Style findDialog_popup GrabFocusTransient
  Style openURLDialog_popup GrabFocusTransient

(use FvwmIdent to find out name/class/resource of a window).  The
GrabFocusTransient option is new to the 2.3.x beta version.  To
actually warp the pointer into the window you could use FvwmEvent.
If you need help in setting up FvwmEvent, don't hesitate to ask.

Bye

In section "BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS"

       You  can override or remove these bindings.  To remove the

Hi !

Can someone explain to me, why that doesn't work ?

AddToFunc XCalcFunction

The calculator shows up, but it has no focus...
Ah, yes: FVWM version 2.3.30

TIA !

This does not work because fvwm does not wait until the calculator
appears before continuing the function.  Thus,

  Next [ Calculator ] focus

is executed before the calculator window is created.  Try this
instead:

  Style Calculator GrabFocus

or wait for the window before continuing:

  AddToFunc XCalcFunction
  + "I" Exec xcalc -geometry +300+200
  + "I" Wait Calculator
  + "I" Next [ Calculator  ] focus

You need to wait for the window to be created:

DestroyFunc XCalcFunction
AddToFunc XCalcFunction

Apologies if this is a FAQ; I didn't see it in the FAQ, but I might
have missed it.

I notice the following behavior in fvwm menus: if a popup menu is
shifted "up" because you're too close to the bottom of the screen;
clicking on the button that pops-up the menu has the effect of
immediately selecting the item that appears where the click
occurred. (Because the shifted menu has placed the menu title bar
"above" the location of the pointer.)

Is it possible to change the timings or menu behavior so that a second
click is *always* required to select a menu item?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm

P.S. Why, you may ask, doesn't he just move the window up so this
problem doesn't occur? Well, it's because I'm running fvwm2 on my iPAQ
and it has a really tiny screen. :-) It also has a touch-sensitive display
which makes it really easy to click but considerably more tedious to
click-and-hold or click-and-hold-and-drag.

Although this is not a problem with the current 2.3.x betas you
will probably want to replace the 'Popup' command with the 'Menu'
command in your config file.  If you use Menu to open menus they
do not pop down when you release the button.

how do I display the rest of it?

occasionaly on this nice powerful machine i have, I have enough windows open to create a menu that is taller than the whole screen and has an arrow at the bottom.

I can't seem to figure out how to pop out the rest of the entries from this arrow...

thanks in advance,

If I understand the question, that little arrow should be a sub menu.  Fvwm2
will cascade for as many sub menus as it needs if the list is too long.

Just click on the last item (with the title "More ...") or press
<cursor right>.

Yea, it _looks_ like a submenu, it says "More..." with an underscore below the first . and has an arrow > at the right of it.  But scrolling to it and pressing enter or any mouse button or any arrow key just makes the whole menu disappear.

Normally, putting the mouse on a submenu makes it appear.  This "automatic" submenu doesn't...do I need to define an action for "More..."?  If so, what would I need to call the submenu it displays.

Fvwm Version 2.2.2

perhaps that's my problem, is this a known bug?

Or, type ".",
or use one of the menustyles that automatically pops up
submenus and just move the pointer or cursor there.

Hello All,
    I am a new user of FVWM and i would like to configure my desktop
with "Click to focus" style rather than focus following the mouse
pointer, Also Is there a way to make ALT+TAB switch focus between window
and bring the relevent window in front (Similar to MS Windows)????

Thanks in advance,
Amit Kumar.

This isn't a window manager question (the window manager doesn't control
what goes on your root window), but...

You can use "xsetroot -solid Blue" or whatever color you want.

Put it into your ~/.xinitrc file (if you're running startx or similar),
or your ~/.Xsession (or sometimes ~/.xsession) of you're using XDM or
similar.

I think the -lXpm before -L/usr/local/xpm/lib is the problem.

Since you are using Solaris 8, try this:

  --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/local/xpm/lib

I'm running the 2.3.32 release on solaris 7 and 8. When using netscape,
I icon the mail window. When mail arrives, the icon changes to indicate
mail. When I read the mail, the icon doesn't return back to its original
state. This used to work correctly in the 2.3.22 timeframe.

Thanks for all the great work.

Hi all,

first I would like to say that fvwm2 is a very great tool.
But if have some problems with a very special implementation.
I am trying to start a performens-meter on different maschines.
If it is started on the working terminal it should have no title.
But if it is started on a remote maschine the title should be displayed.

I wrote a script that changes the name wenn it is started on the local
maschine.
(it uses xosview -name "perfmeter")
Otherwise the title of the xosview window will be "xosview@host name".

How can I define the styles in order to get this running.
Or is it impossible to start one programm with two different styles?

Thank you for reading so far.

Looking forward to get a reply to my question.

Best regards

Marcus Eyckeler

Thanks!

I downloaded the fvwm-snap-20010510.tar.gz snapshot, rebuilt, and indeed it
is fixed :-)

A couple of minor comments on the snapshot - if it's of any help:-

1) The build complained about missing libs/fvwmlib.h. I replaced libs/ with
../libs/ in Makefile.in to fix it.

2) I noticed the new comment in INSTALL.fvwm:-
     Cygwin users: try "make -i -k" and "make -i -k install" to work
     around the Cygwin problem, not supporting POSIX's mkfifo;
     FvwmCommand will be skipped.
In fact this is not necessary (of course it does no harm) in the latest
version of Cygwin, which includes a dummy version of mkfifo (just returns
-1, and errno=88=ENOSYS="Function not implemented"). Of course FvwmCommand
doesn't work, but it now builds OK.

Tim.

Aha! FvwmBacker is getting a M_NEW_PAGE whenever I deiconify (or select from
the taskbar or other window manager menu) a window - regardless of whether a
page/desk change has occurred. Eg. here's what I got (with a bit more detail
in the debug output):-

  Reload modules' config:-
    FvwmBacker: config *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page * *) -solid \#3F5469
    FvwmBacker: config *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 1, Page * *) -solid purple4
    FvwmBacker: config *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 2, Page * *) -solid
DarkOliveGreen4
    FvwmBacker: config *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 3, Page * *) -solid brown4
  Select window on desk 1 (originally on desk 0):-
    FvwmBacker: new desk (desk=1)
    FvwmBacker: new page (pagex=0,pagey=0,desk=1)
  Select window on desk 1 again:-
    FvwmBacker: new page (pagex=0,pagey=0,desk=1)

Obviously this last command is doing an unnecessary xsetroot, which causes
Exceed to refresh everything (I've verified that a manual xsetroot has the
same result).

I seem to be able to fix the problem by adding a test in ProcessMessage,
which skips any action if the same page and desk is selected (patch to
fvwm-snap-20010510 attached). Is that the right place to fix this?

Thanks,
Tim.

Apologies up front if the below is over 80 wide, I'm at work...

I'm using FvwmButtons as a panel to show/hide my pager.  What I'd like =

is have the default be to show what's in the panel ( pressing the =
indicator ).
Is this possible?  I was going to try FakeClick but thought maybe there =
was an
easier way.  Thanks!

It may be some mis-calculation of the menu size.  For The 2.3.x
betas I rewrote the menu sizing code.  Could you try if this 
works for you?  Ptherwise, please send your config file along with
detailed instructions how to see the problem.

No, that feature is not implemented yet.

Eck! I recently upgraded to FVWM2.3.32 (So I could use the scroll mouse
on FvwmButtons). Unfortunately, I now find that my alt-tab settings no
longer
work. I've removed the default, before fvwm2 reads those configs, but to
no avail.

As a configuration, I use

DestroyFunc "alt-tab"
AddToFunc "alt-tab"          "I" Next ( CurrentDesk CurrentPage ) Focus
+                            "I" Current Raise
DestroyFunc "shift-alt-tab"
AddToFunc "shift-alt-tab"    "I" Prev ( CurrentDesk CurrentPage ) Focus
+                            "I" Current Raise

Key Tab A M -
Key Tab A MS -
#Key Tab         A       MS     Prev Focus
Key Tab         A       MS      Function "shift-alt-tab"
#Key Tab         A       M      Next Focus
Key Tab         A       M       Function "alt-tab"

Also, all of the key presses that used to go to the window manager, not
go
to the application, so in vim, if I type Ctrl-<rightarrow>, I end up in
insert
mode. Most annoying.

Also, I can no longer click inside a window (xterm) to select it, as I
could
before. I am using

Style "*" ClickToFocus
Style "*" ClickToFocusPassesClick, ClickToFocusRaises

I realise that this may be a much much. Is there a simple migration
guide for
uses of 2.2.x to 2.3.x? Or would it be easiest to start from scratch? In
which
case, which commands should I enter in order to blow away any default
dehaviour?

Thanks for your time and patience. (Looking forward to trying out
libstroke
later ;) Would be fun on a laptop... if only I didn;t sell mine...

Not quite the same problem as I have sometimes, but I DO occasionally have
a menu that's too large for my screen that I can't expand because the part
that should say "More..." is offscreen.  Oh, I HATE that...
Version is fvwm2-2.2.4-4.
I have an fvwm95 holdover at the bottom of my screen of a taskbar-type
strip.  I guess it has some "Always on top to interfere with your large
menus" option set...

Another thing I've noticed is that "FvwmTaskbar" occasionally seems to
show up as being some freaky memory hog in "top."  It's the only thing I
ever get any FVWM-related errors with.  Is that what that aforementioned
strip at the bottom is called?

I'm not clear on why FvwmBacker is getting NEW_PAGE messages when
a window is deiconified.  Can you look in your .fvwm2rc and find the
key or mouse binding that you are using to deiconify the window?

I don't get NEW_PAGE messages when I deiconify.

I notice that I've got FvwmBacker configured like this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmBackerDesk
*FvwmBackerDesk 0 Exec xsetroot -solid blue
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 Exec xsetroot -solid midnightblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 Exec xsetroot -solid yellow
*FvwmBackerDesk 3 Exec xsetroot -solid black

Where you are using the built in background changing, like this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmBackerDesk
*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid blue
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid midnightblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid yellow
*FvwmBackerDesk 3 -solid black

So I now see where that annoying refresh comes from, around line
218 in FvwmBacker.c there is a call to XSetWindowBackground.
Thats the call that actually causes the refresh.  I think the
"Exec xsetroot" approach is preferrable until FvwmBacker gets
better logic for setting the background.

The change you proposed to FvwmBacker might be a good idea, I'd like
to give it some thought, first I'd like to understand why deiconification
is causing a NEW_PAGE command to be generated.

Hmm. I'm confused. I want button 4 of my titlebar to display
'maximize.xpm' on a normal window and 'restore.xpm' on a maximized
window. What I get is 'maximize.xpm' on all windows.  I must be doing
something stupid, but I don't see what.

Here are the relevant lines from my .fvwm2rc file:

ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap /home/ndw/Graphics/pixmaps/menu.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap /home/ndw/Graphics/pixmaps/close.xpm

# Why doesn't this work?

Hi Dan,

I have the following definitions for selecting a window from the taskbar. I
guess the same function is used when I select the window from the WindowList
(and get the same behaviour that way).

  *FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  DestroyFunc DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc DeiconifyFocusAndRaise I Iconify off
  +                                I Focus
  +                                I Raise

> I don't get NEW_PAGE messages when I deiconify.

I also use

  DeskTopSize 1x1

and define four desks in my pager. Is that relevant?

Sorry, I don't understand this. What's wrong with the internal
XSetWindowBackground? I get the same refresh when I run xsetroot from an
xterm.

Thanks,

I vaguely recall something about this. I worked on FvwmBacker a while
back and remember getting a lot of spurious NEW_PAGE events. I don't
know that I ever figured out why.

For this to work MwmDecorMax button hint is not enough, you should have:

  Style "*" MwmButtons

With Style "*" FvwmButtons, only maximize.xpm is used.

Howdy, I've had this problem for ages now (ever since fvwm-2.0 was
released I think). Whenever I try to save something (ALT-s) within
netscape the "Save As..." window shows up with only 1 button
eventhough I have 2 buttonstyles specified and all my
windows/xterms/etc have these 2 buttons on them.

#.fvwmrc parts
ButtonStyle 1 17 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0
                 60x50@0 80x70@1 80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0
                 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1
ButtonStyle 2 14  0x0@1   0x20@1 20x20@0 20x0@0   0x0@1  0x25@1
                 25x25@1 25x0@1  55x0@1 55x55@0  0x55@0  0x60@1
                 60x60@1 60x0@1

#     Button    Context Modifi  Function
Mouse 0         1       A       Iconify
Mouse 0         2       A       Resize

(please note that each buttonstyle is a single line)

So here's the weird thing.  When I get this transient "Save As..."
window for the first time after starting Netscape its size is normal.
All subsequent times, its almost half the "normal" size and I have to
go into my menu setting and "resize" that window.

Is this a known bug ?

BTW-1: my ALT-f "Netscape: Find" also shows up without a second
button, but it doesn't have the half-sized problem.

BTW-2: my ALT-o "Netscape: Open Page" also shows up without a second
button and it also beeps whenever I try to resize it (that's fine,
just mentioning it to note that the lack of a second button makes
sense since that button is used for resizing, but is fvwm that
smart ?? :-)

Thanks for the help in advance.

This question was asked (and answered) several days ago, about mozilla.

Netscape uses MWM hints to control buttons. If you don't like this, do:

  Style Netscape NoDecorHint

I saw these Netscape size problems too. I think this is a Netscape bug.

_You_ made it smart by assigning mwm hints to some buttons (MwmDecorMin,
MwmDecorMax, MwmDecorMenu and more) in your rc.

Then Netscape asks not to show maximize and minimize buttons for some
of its subwindows and FVWM respects this by default (Style MwmDecor).

Mikhael.

hi,
i'm new here, so hello everybody.

could anyone try to reproduce this behaviour, or give me a hint?

below is the .bash_profile part which defines my PS1.
it works fine, but fvwm seems to have a problem with the titlebar, when a
new xterm is opened. the titlebar simply says 'xterm', until i change to
some directory for the first time. from then on it works properly.
with twm the ps1 definition works without problems here.

thanks in advance
martin novak

info:
system:	freebsd 4.3s
bash:	2.05
fvwm:	2.2.5
i've had this behaviour since fbsd 3.x, bash 2.03, fvwm 2.??

.bash_profile part:
...

[snip...]

You'll need to debug your .bash_profile to find out why "prmpt1" isn't
getting called.  Is anything else in your .bash_profile executing when
you open an xterm?

I also run fun stuff in my xterm title bars, my setup is real simple and
looks like this:

==== .profile ====
# ... stuff above here, irrelevant (set path, etc..)
if [ X"${SHELL}" = X"" ]; then
    echo "SHELL not defined! (Rob msg 1)"
else
    BSHELL="`basename ${SHELL}`" ; export BSHELL
fi

# going interactive!
if [ -f ${HOME}/.profile-login ]; then
    case $- in
        *i*) . ${HOME}/.profile-login ;;
        *)   # do nothing, really.  ;;
    esac
# feh, sh doesn't know the above
    if [ X"${BSHELL}" = X"sh" ]; then
        go() { . ${HOME}/.profile-login ; }
    fi
fi
==== end of .profile ====
==== .profile-login ====
# ... stuff above here, irrelevant (define aliases, some interactive vars)
case ${BSHELL} in
    sh)
        # irrelevant stuff here
    ;;
    bash)
        set -o emacs
        if [ X"${TERM}" = X"xterm" -o X"${TERM}" = X "xterm-color" ]; then
            if [ X"${UID}" = X"0" ]; then
                PS1=": (r) \h; \[\033]2;-root- \h:\w\007\]"
            else
                PS1=": \h; \[\033]2;\h:\w\007\]"
            fi
        else
            if [ X"${UID}" = X"0" ]; then
                PS1=": (r) \h:\w#; "
            else
                PS1=": \h:\w; "
            fi
        fi
        chfont()  { echo -en "\033]50;$*\007" ; }
        chicon()  { echo -en "\033]1;$*\007" ; }
        chtitle() { echo -en "\033]2;$*\007" ; }
    ;;
    ksh)
        # more stuff, irrelevant
    ;;
    zsh)
        # more stuff, irrelevant
    ;;
    *)  
    echo "wtf!?!?!  I don't know what you are running."
    ;;
esac

if [ ! X"${PS1}" = X"" ]; then
    export PS1
fi

==== end of .profile-login ====

As you can tell, I don't bother with shell-specific dotfiles.

In fact, you also need:

  Style Netscape NoFuncHint

because NoDecorHint has no effect with MwmFunctions.

I am running FVWM2 2.2.32 with gnome enabled. How do I start gnome panel
when I start my X session? Right now, I am starting it in .xinitrc. There must
be a way to start from .fvwm2rc. How do I use the Gnome sounds?

Any help appreciated.

TIA.

Hei

   Just to add my two cents worth . . . I also have this problem.

--FVWM2 Version--

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.15 compiled on Mar 17 2000 at 16:58:55
[FVWM][main]:  with support for:  Stroke XPM

--WinList Invocation--

Mouse 3 R       CM      Module FvwmWinList Transient

--Problem Description--

Menu...                >
  "<Click>", "<Enter>", "<Right Arrow>" all do Nothing.

Other items on list:
  "<Click>", "<Enter>" warp to the window, as expected.

All Items on list:
  "<Left Arrow>"  list vanishes.
  "[0-9]" "[a-z]" "." warps (in turn) to each item with that "tag"
                        (no other action)

--.fvwm2rc--

   See attachment

--How to Reproduce--

   The following script does the trick for me:)

----- lots-of-xterms --------------
#!/bin/ksh
#
typeset -i XTERM=0
while [[ $XTERM -lt 60 ]]
 do
  xterm &
  ((XTERM+=1))
  sleep 1
 done
-----------------------------------

   For this test, I brought up FVWM2 with fvwmbuttons and 1 xterm
running, I then run the script above (lots-of-xterms).  Once it settles
down, I hold down the control key and poke mouse3, up pops the
FVWMWinList, I mouse&|scroll to "Menu..." and the only things I can do
that get any response is [0-9] [a-z] & [Left Arrow], and none of those
fire the "Menu" (so to speak).

Thanks!

thanks for your reply. i'm not sure what you meant by "..not getting
called..". prmpt1 definitely gets called, the problem is the initial update
of the titlebar in fvwm (from 'xterm' to 'host: /some/path'). ps1 is set to
what is defined in the func, but fvwm doesn't use the titlebar value until
the value gets changed (e.g. after i 'cd' somewhere).
to me it seems like some sort of a timing problem, because a 'sleep 1'
after the prmpt1 call does the job...

That did the trick -- you might consider adding that to the FAQ.

BTW: are there any adverse affects to disabling those hints ?

Thanks

This works for me. Although I myself would rewrite this to be more clean:

  DestroyFunc SelectWindow
  AddToFunc   SelectWindow
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToFocus 50 50  # optional

  Key Tab A M  Prev SelectWindow
  Key Tab A MS Next SelectWindow

Do you mean Alt-Tab does nothing for you or does a wrong thing?

This should not be this way. Correctly defined Key bindings should work.

Unless you use other style lines later that match your xterm, it should
work as you expect, and it indeed works for me as expected.

All these problems may indicate that something went wrong, like:

  * you run an incorrect fvwm2 executable
  * your .fvwm2rc file is not read for some reason

If you think that these don't happen, please post here your full .fvwm2rc
file (you may skip menus or other private information if needed).

2.3.x is mostly 2.2.x compatible. You may run fvwm24_convert, it does some
job to make your fvwm2rc file up to date.

But usually you only need (optionally) to move ~/.fvwm2rc to ~/.fvwm/
directory, run a correct fvwm2 and see which warning you get on the
standard error. Then use the man page to fix these warnings one by one.

We here will help you to get a working setup, ask if there are any
migration problems.

Mikhael.

Hi fvwm@fvwm.org

i try to explain my problem first:

when I press the pulldown menu of netscape the menu shows up as
expected, but once in a month netscape refuses to continue, it simply
stalls. When showing up the pulldown menu the mouse pointer changes its
shape, e.g. from an "X" to an arrow pointing north-east. A further
consequence of this is I can't focus any other windows anymore. Netscape
(or netscape's pull down menu) doesn't release the  focus.


So I switch back to a virtual console via CTRL-ALT-F1 and  kill netscape
with "pkill -9 netscape". switiching back to X reveals that netscape is
really dead but unfortunately the mouse is still an arrow pointing
north-east and thus I can't focus any other windows leaving X-windows in
an unusable state. now i have to kill x-windows from a virtual console
and start it, again ;-(


I hope that there is a way to restart fvwm from the console?
Maybe there are some other suggestions?

thanks for any help.

oh, here is my machine:

In theory, yes (the application might even crash because it can't
handle that these hints are ignored).  In reality I never saw any
adverse effects though.

Hello fvwm

Request for permission to use a screenshot

We are currently working on a series of highly illustrated computer-related
books for the publishers Dorling Kindersley. The titles range from
step-by-step guides for applications such as Word and Excel, to general
guides for using a PC.

One of the titles in progress at the moment is "Linux: An Introduction" and=
,
as an example of a desktop window manager, we would like to include one of
the screenshots from your screenshot pages. The one we would like to use wa=
s
submitted by Paul E. Johnson, and I=B9ve mailed him for his permission to use
the screenshot as well.

We will naturally credit your organization, and I would be grateful if you
could grant us permission to use the screenshot in the book.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible because the
production of the book is almost complete.

Thanks for your attention

John Watson

It would be easier to answer knowing which system you are running.

If you mean to determine which WMs are installed on your system, you
should find a list of software. Try "rpm -a" on the rpm based systems.

If you mean to determine which WM you are currently running, try "ps xf"
or a similar equivalent.

If you mean to determine which FVWM version you have installed, run
"fvwm2 -version" or in the latest versions "fvwm-config".

If you mean to determine which FVWM version you are currently running,
it is possible with 2.3.x. Open FvwmConsole or FvwmTalk and type
"Exec xmessage $v" or "Echo $v".

I hope this answers your question.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Provided Paul has no objection, I don't think we do either.
Note that fvwm is a cooperative effort of the fvwm-workers.
We all read this list.  If you don't get an objection from anyone
on this list in a day or two, its safe to assume none of us object.

Subject: FVWM: Q: Dynamically renaming desks in FvwmPager
X-Mailer: VM 6.75 under 21.1 (patch 12) "Channel Islands" XEmacs Lucid
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Currently I use FvwmPager to display the current desk w/name (as
defined by *FvwmPagerLabel configuration lines) and then have a larger
FvwmPager displaying all desks that is in a FvwmButtons panel.

I would like to be able to dynamically rename desks (to reflect the
current project that I'm actively working on on a give desk).

Is there any way to do this without killing and restarting the
FvwmPager module?

Alternatively has anyone solved this problem in a different way?

Thanks in advance,

Von

Hi there

First, i'd like to say that FVWM is the best window manager (to me), no
other are so configurable... and FAST!!!

Well, i have two questions to ask:

1 - fvwm will have support to 'declare internal variables' - i.e., like in
a shell script, i would say "set color1 white" in the beginning of fvwm2rc
and use $color1 in the following commands.. or declare  "set shell
rxvt" to use "exec $shell..." (without fvwmcpp or fvwmm4) ??

2 - i'm writting a program using tcl/tk, and i'd like to access, form it,
functions of fvwm - like 'click in a button and open a fvwm's menu, or
change the screen'... - it's possible ???
(you know, everybody wants a personal 'panel cde-like'... i'm writting it
on tk...)


   Thanks,
        Leonardo Rosa

These answers are based on the latest beta releases.

You can set variables like this:

SetEnv xx dan

You can then use variables like this:

Echo $[xx]

The square brackets are required.

>From the .fvwm2rc, start the Fvwm command server like this:

Module FvwmCommandS

Then from the command line or a script, you can do:

fork> FvwmCommand 'SetEnv xx dan'
fork> FvwmCommand 'Echo $[xx]'

which put this on stderr:

 [FVWM][Echo]:  dan

> (you know, everybody wants a personal 'panel cde-like'... i'm writting it

Personally, I like the window manager to be invisible, I don't even
run the pager, but as you pointed out, Fvwm is highly configurable
so we all get what we like.

No problem.  I still reommend to ask your questions on the fvwm
mailing list where you can contact many competent fvwm users and
developers.  Now to your question:

As far as I know, there has been no active development on fvwm95
for a very long time.  Since fvwm95 was released initially as an
offspring of fvwm, fvwm has acquired almost all features of
fvwm95.  If continued sowftware development and bug fixing is
important to you, you are better off with fvwm.  A WIn95 like
configuration ported to fvwm from fvwm95 comes with the 2.3.x beta
releases.

Bye

No, for now you should restart it to get changes, i.e. KillModule & Module.

FvwmPager labels were designed to be static. If you still want to make
them dynamical, you may use FvwmCommand when switching projects, it may
replace labels and restart relevant module(s).

Mikhael.

My RedHat box (originally 5.2, upgraded to 6.2) came with what appears to
have been FVWM95.  I am guessing that when I upgraded to 6.2, it upgraded
FVWM to FVWM2 as that is what I'm now running.  It saved my configuration
files, so I still have a Windows95 look and feel going on.  My screenshot
might not be that professional, but you get the idea, hm?

http://www.sfgoth.com/~tenebrae/gallery/tenemiyuscreenshot.jpg

This screenshot is a little less than a year old, but I'm lazy and that's
pretty much what my desktop still looks like.
I love FVWM in all its incarnations.  :)

I'm not sure I know what you mean by the last phrase, are you doing
your own bug fixes to fvwm95?

If so, you might find that you don't have to go it alone with fvwm2,
we accept and incorporate user supplied patches very frequently.

If you subscribe to this list for a while, I think you will agree
that fvwm support is quite good.

Hello!

Is it possible to generate mouse button actions by pressing
a key, such as "Key F11   A  N MouseButton 2" ?
The CursorMove moves the cursor, but I cannot find any
function to press a button. This would make it possible to
use X-windows without a mouse (to a degree).

Thanks in advance,
David Kaasen.

HI,

	I'm trying to config my FVWM so I have to touch the mouse for only few 
operations (none at all would be great :-) ). I already have keys to move 
from desk/page to desk/page, close windows, alternate windows, etc... but 
there's one thing I could find how to do: is there a way to "drag" or move a 
window only with keyboard? like pressing CMS + arrows ?

	Thanks,
			Christian Lyra

Christian,

   Yes, this is possible and quite easy.  Here's (approx) what I use:

      # Shift + Arrow : move window to edge of desk

      Key Left  FSTW S Move  0  w Warp
      Key Right FSTW S Move -0  w Warp
      Key Up    FSTW S Move  w  0 Warp
      Key Down  FSTW S Move  w -0 Warp

      # Shift + Alt + Arrow : move window by 20 pixels

      Key Left  FSTW SM Move w-20p w Warp
      Key Right FSTW SM Move w+20p w Warp
      Key Up    FSTW SM Move w w-20p Warp
      Key Down  FSTW SM Move w w+20p Warp

      # Shift + Ctrl + Arrow : move window by 1 pixel

      Key Left  FSTW SC Move w-1p w Warp
      Key Right FSTW SC Move w+1p w Warp
      Key Up    FSTW SC Move w w-1p Warp
      Key Down  FSTW SC Move w w+1p Warp

   I hope that helps you.  I'm also a mouseless fanatic!

Cheers, Joseph

In the latest betas, you will find the FakeClick command.
It may help.  Generated mouse events are marked by X as synthetic
and may not be accepted by all applications.

There's also a mouse/buttons utility thats not part of Fvwm
whose name escapes me right now that turns the number keypad into
a mouse control.  Someone else might remember the name.

No, its not Flight Simulator.


How about this from the X11 FAQ:

Subject:  36)! How can I control the mouse with the keyboard?

If you have the X Keyboard (XKB) Extension, you can enable mouse keys, which
makes it possible to generate mouse motion and button events using the
keyboard.   Events generated by MouseKeys are completely transparent -- they
will work with any application that connects to a server that has the X
Keyboard Extension, regardless of whether the application itself uses XKB.

XKB is enabled by default in X11R6.1.  

First, set up the Num Lock key so that Shift+Num_Lock toggles mouse keys:

 xmodmap -e "keysym Num_lock = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys"

(XFree86 3.1.2E is based on R6.1 and has the X Keyboard Extension; it also
has a binding to Pointer_EnableKeys in its default keymap.  You use
Alt+Shift+Num_Lock to toggle MouseKeys on and off.  If you are using an
earlier release of X or XFree86, you won't have XKB and the instructions will
not work. See http://www.XFree86.org/FAQ for more information.)

You might also have to turn off server num lock for this to work.  
Now press "Shift+Num_Lock" to enable MouseKeys.  When MouseKeys are on:

o)   The keypad arrow keys move the pointer
o)   The keypad '5' key behaves like the 'default' pointer button
o)   The keypad '0' key locks the default pointer button (for easy dragging)
o)   The keypad '.' key unlock the default pointer button (to release a drag)
o)   The keypad '+' key double-clicks the default pointer button.
o)   The keypad '/' key sets the 'default' button to Button1
o)   The keypad '*' key sets the default button to Button2
o)   The keypad '-' key sets the default button to Button3

This is the default configuration, but the mechanism allows for nearly
infinite configurability.

On a similar subject, is there an app that pushes buttons ala Windoze Dialog
Box Killers?

I can close via FVWMEvent, but that's not always the right selection to
close a "dialog box".

I think you can enable that in the X server, not in the window manager.
I don't know what the option is called,  I'm sorry.

Joseph Manning already gave good examples of some non-interactive and
interactive window movement.

But there is another simple solution using built-in features of Move,
which fully supports keyboard. Just bind the Move command to a key, like:

  Key F7  A M Move
  Key F8  A M Resize
  Key F9  A M Iconify
  Key F10 A M Maximize

press Alt-F7 (like in mwm) and then use arrows to move a window in any
direction. Without any modifier the window size units are used for moving,
i.e. if you move an xterm with 7x13 font it is incremented in +-7 and +-13.
Use Shift with arrows to increment +-100, and Ctrl with arrows for +-1.
The same arrow key rules apply for resizing (Alt-F8 in this example).
Press Esc to cancel moving or resizing.

If you press Alt-F7 and Alt-F8 when no window is focussed, you are first
supplied with a cross cursor (configurable in CursorStyle SELECT) and
asked to select a window. This can be done using only a keyboard too,
the arrows and Shift and Ctrl modifiers behave as usual.
It is easier to see all this in action and understand.

These interactive features of the Move and Resize commands are correct for
the latest 2.3.x versions. Previous versions may behave differently.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There should be a setting in the BIOS to control which events bring the
computer out of sleep mode.

I thought there was a reference in our FAQ, but I can't find it.
Is it possible that the corresponding paragraph was removed?

Hello.

When I iconify and app, it has an icon and a trimmed title under it.
Can I tell fvwm display the full title or set the minimum/maximal title
length?

I wrote some Perl to go thru the FAQ revisions.  This was
removed with revision 1.21:

3.5  You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
     presses?

A: Hm.  This one is a little tougher.  It could be done, but many
   programs ignore synthetic events, which is what would be generated.
   In X11R6.1 there is an extension (called XKBD?) which can do this,
   but I don't want to code to anything specific to one of the newer
   X11 versions like this.  You could try using Xse, which is a
   program to interface to XSendEvent, available at ftp.x.org.  It
   could probably be used in a simliar manner to xcb above (or in
   conjunction with it).  If anyone comes up with good examples for
   this, please send it to the fvwm mailing list for inclusion here.

There's already @0 for the shadow color and @1 for the highlight color 
when drawing vector lines for buttons.  Is it a good idea to add @2 and @3 
or something like that for the foreground and background color?

Also, for pixmaps in general, would it be possible to have colors in the 
xpm named 'Highlight' and 'Shadow' which would get cast to the highlight 
and shadow colors (and maybe 'Foreground' or 'Background')?  ctwm does this, 
and I think maybe CDE but it's been a while.

Only indirectly.  The title is trimmed to the width of the icon
picture.  If you disable icons (but not icon titles), the full
titlte will always be shows.  Also, you could create a set of
icon pixmaps that have a transparent area left and right of the
actual image.

Buttons don't have foreground and background colors.
Only "Solid colorname", which I guess you could take to be
the background.  I suppose you could use the HilightFore color
as the foreground.

As I remember, we've had a few comments about not being able to
"lift the pen off the paper" while drawing vectors, and supporting
a background color would do that.

Still, if you really want to go all out with buttons, using pixmaps
gives a lot of control.

Since pixmaps support the color "None", you get a "Background" by using
"None".

I've seen the references to symbolic colors in XPMs but never seen
them used.

Other users have asked about  supporting other image formats,  besides
xpm.   Supporting other formats would  confound this  feature.  For my
own use, I'd  look at further extensions  as bloat.  Thats not to say,
I'm absolutely against  them.  I'm just trying to  make the point that
there should be a clear benefit to adding more features.

Both of  these   ideas are interesting.  Instead  of   asking if these
features are a good idea, point out the benefits.

It won't hurt to put a reference to the X11 FAQ in our FAQ.

Buttons take the highlight/shadow/foreground/background colors that are 
given to the border.  I know this, because I have a theme that uses this 
to get proper vector line colors for different focus/unfocus colors.  
Generating 50 different pixmaps that are basically the same, except for 
the color, seems rather wasteful if it can be taken care of in some more
automatic way.

For instance, I currently use highlight/shadow colors for this:

  # A low bar.
  AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 5 14x63@1 77x63@1 77x77@1 14x77@1 14x63@1
  
  # A square. with a thicker top side
  AddButtonStyle 4 Vector 7 14x14@1 77x14@1 77x21@1 14x21@1 14x77@1 \
                            77x77@1 77x14@1
  
  # A simple X
  AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 2 14x14@1 42x42@1 
  AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 2 42x49@1 14x77@1 
  AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 2 77x14@1 49x42@1
  AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 2 49x49@1 77x77@1

This yields BlackBox-style buttons; being able to have the vector lines
the same color as the current foreground of the border (now that we have
colorsets, that is a valid thing).  Just using the shadow color or the
highlight color is sometimes not what you want; for instance, maybe you 
want the vector lines to be in the same color as the foreground, which 
happens to be black, but that screws up highlight/shadow for light-colored 
themes.

Pish posh; you can use AddButtonStyle to "lift the pen off the paper".
Colorsets are around, so things have background/foreground/highlight/shadow 
whether you want them or not.

> gives a lot of control.

I do *not* want to go all out with buttons.  I just want to be able to 
specify buttons that go with the current foreground color.  I do *not* 
want to suggest that fvwm embed gimp inside it.


> Since pixmaps support the color "None", you get a "Background" by using

I *know* that.  I've used it.

Download and try out ctwm.  It yields, for instance, interesting raised 
patterns on title bars without having to create different pixmaps for 
every single color combo anyone could want.

Well, yes.  I don't suggest things just to suggest things.  If I
didn't think there would be some benefit, I wouldn't try.  Of course,
technically there's no "clear" benefit to having retracting icon titles,
button vectors, or specifying different cursors using pixmaps, so one
might as well just use wm2, hacked for certain key strokes, and be done 
with it.

I want to run xvkbd which has the odd property that it should never
steal focus. I think this worked under 2.2.*, but it doesn't seem to
be working (for all apps, anyway) under 2.3.32.

                                        Be seeing you,

Do you mean get focus?

Its probably setting the input focus property to false.

By default, Fvwm honors this ICCCM rule.
You can override that for individual windows with
the Lenience Style.  Perhaps you've done that?

If so, you can undo it for just xvkbd with a Style command.

I actually have a patch which does what you describe for a month already. :)

I do think that this is useful. I didn't mention this patch yet, because
we are now in the feature freeze and I am not very comfortable with a
limited vector functionality. To fully benefit an ability to draw using
background and foreground button colors we should extend vectors (lines)
to areas (rectangles, probably circle segments and so on). Lines are
usually only useful when drawing reliefs using shadow and highlight colors.
So, all this should be thought-out first.

Yes, such xpm's are used in CDE, for example in its panel.

This would be useful to have. Currently we, in fvwm-themes, solved this
problem by having gray reliefs for panel pixmaps. This works ok for most
of color schemes, but not for all. Of course the correct solution is to
use highlight and shadow colors in xpm (also called topShadowColor and
bottomShadowColor), so even on the red background the arrows would look
nice, with a relief based on the red color and not on the hardcoded gray.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi Dominik,

I've adjusted the subject line to distinguish my remaining problem (thanks
to you and others on this list, of the other two, one has been fixed and I
have a patch for the other). The following tests are all with a local
fvwm-snap-20010510, built under Cygwin 1.3.1 on Windows 2000, and Exceed
6.2.0.16 as X-server.

On 01 May 2001, I wrote:

I added debug messages to RaiseOrLowerWindow() and confirmed that it is not
called when I get this mysterious "autoraise". I have however found some
more clues that might help track down the cause of this problem.

First, I have found some option settings that seem to "cure" the autoraise
problem (but in other respects aren't much to my liking). I also narrowed
down my .fvwm2rc to the simplest that demonstrates it. With just the
following .fvwm2rc (and nothing else), I get the autoraise problem:-

  Style * ClickToFocus
  BugOpts RaiseOverNativeWindows
  EdgeScroll 0 0
  EdgeThickness 0
  DeskTopSize 1x1

However if I comment out (or explicitly set default values for) the
EdgeScroll, EdgeThickness, and DeskTopSize lines, the problem goes away. If
*any* of the above settings is restored, then the problem returns. This is
very curious, as the connection between window raising and the desktop size
/ scrolling functions seems obscure.

Unfortunately, even with those lines removed, the behaviour still isn't
perfect (though much better). Now the active X-window isn't raised over a
native window, even when I click in it - I have to click on the title bar or
borders. Contrariwise, inactive X-windows are raised correctly if I click
inside the window.

Another observation: although most application windows (eg. FvwmForm, xterm,
emacs, rclock) show the autoraising problem, xlogo and xclock don't. What's
different about these guys? In particular, rclock and xclock seem pretty
similar, but the former shows the autoraise bug.

Finally, I had a look with Exceed's tracing facility. I'm not really
qualified to interpret the results, but I hope I've extracted the relevant
portion that someone else can understand. I append the results to this
message (please let me know if you want more detail).

Does any of this help diagnose the problem?

Thanks,
Tim.

===============================

The format seems to be (taking the first line below as an example): packet
71, 648723 milliseconds from server start, socket 1, protocol request number
42, protocol request name SetInputFocus. This is followed by the request
parameters.

This first sequence occurred when I moved the mouse from a native (Notepad)
window over to an active X-window (xterm) which partially concealed behind
it. The xterm window was (incorrectly) raised (and received input focus).

Next, I did the same, but this time with an inactive xterm window, also
behind the native window. The only result was:-

Hello,

For those of you that are interested in doing so getting fvwm2 to run on
Cygwin+XFree86 is fairly easy. All one has to do is install Cygwin+XFree86
both of which are available from sources.redhat.com and install fvwm2
in the usual way and then edit /usr/X11R6/lib/startxwin.bat so that the line:

start vtwm

becomes:

REM start vtwm
start /usr/local/bin/fvwm2

and then run /usr/X11R6/bin/startxwin.bat.

I am using the version of cygwin from January with DLL version major 1001,
minor 8, epoch 19. The newer version of cygwin has a prebuilt version of
the XPM package as well among other enhancements.

Fvwm version 2.3.32 has the same problem as 2.3.31 (not really a problem
though) which is that make halts when mkfifo is encountered just before
the FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS stuff. Theoretically it should be possible
to fix this becaue the configure script detects POSIX compliance as not
being available.

As of this moment the window on which I recompiled fvwm2 is not repainting
itself and the Close entry from the drop down menu is not working but
everything else seems to be working fine.

Regards,

Neil

A dummy mkfifo is included in the latest versions of Cygwin (it's in 1.3.1).
This means that the build goes OK, though FvwmCommand still doesn't work.

For previous versions of Cygwin, you can use "make -i -k" to ignore errors,
though you'll have to watch the output more carefully in case there's some
other fatal error.

That's a good point. I notice that configure already checks for mkfifo.
Wouldn't it be best to disable the compilation of FvwmCommand if this check
fails (I assume this doesn't happen now)? With the dummy mkfifo in the new
Cygwin, the configure check passes, so we'd still get a broken FvwmCommand -
but at least then the build would work in all these cases.

Does anyone know of a way to set a pop-up menu's width? I am trying to
pad a pop-up so it's more even, but I'm having little luck...

You you need to pad menu item elements (i.e. insert and sometimes remove
spacing), there is a new MenuStyle option ItemFormat, see the man page.

If you need something else please elaborate.

Ok, here is a patch for old Cygwin versions. Add these 3 lines to the end
of modules/FvwmCommand/FvwmCommand.h:

#ifndef HAVE_MKFIFO
#define mkfifo(path, mode) ((errno = ENOSYS) - ENOSYS - 1)
#endif

I will apply this if someone with old Cygwin versions test that there are
no other problems. I don't have non POSIX systems.

Mikhael.

Yes, I saw this Netscape's bug too. It leaves cursor grabbed.

You may send SIGUSR1 to fvwm2 process in 2.2.x and 2.3.x versions:

  pkill -USR1 fvwm2

Another possible solution is to run FvwmCommandS and then execute from
the command line "FvwmCommand Restart".

But I am not sure whether restarting of FVWM solves this problem.

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Exec exec panel

I also have the following line

  Style panel GNOMEIgnoreHints

because it seems that either panel in GNOME 1.4 does not use GNOME hints
correctly (it is first shaded when collapsed) or FVWM has no fully correct
GNOME hints support, I can't check right now which one.

> How do I use the Gnome sounds?

I suppose, this is not an FVWM question. Otherwise "man FvwmEvent".

Now when you said about sounds. I noticed that I don't have sounds in
GNOME applications even if I have sound enabled in Control Center.
When I turn this checkbox off and on and then apply, sounds appear in
new apps. I don't know why it is, esd is always running. I think people
on GNOME lists know the answer.

To ensure all your apps are started after entire .fvwm2rc is processed,
launch them from InitFunction.

Please try with fvwm-2.3.32. There will be no 2.2.6.
You will need to specify $HOME/.fvwm2rc.m4 or move this file to ~/.fvwm/.

If there are problems please submit a bug from www.fvwm.org or send to the
fvwm-workers list relevant lines from your .xsession, .fvwm2rc and a way to
reproduce the problem. Thanks.

Mikhael.

I can't reproduce this neither with fvwm-2.2.5 nor fvwm-2.3.32, window
names are successfully changed from xterm without any cd command.

Use FvwmIdent and/or xwininfo to determine whether a window title that you
see is correct.

Mikhael.

I've seen this also, although with a different app (not Netscape).

Granted a well-behaved app shouldn't lock up to the point of needing
kill -9 at any point, much less with the cursor grabbed; nevertheless
it seems like a bug somewhere (X server? Window Manager?) to allow
the cursor to remain grabbed after the window that grabbed it has
been destroyed.  Is there any prospect of fixing it, or does this
turn out to be one of those fundamental X problems that's not easily
fixed?

It just occurred to me that this could be an xterm bug (or feature :-/)
In the version I have (XFree86 4.0.1c(146)) there is a compile-time option
to avoid "flicker" and not update the title when it is the same.  Maybe
xterm (erroneously) thinks that the title hasn't changed?

Add these lines to your .fvwm2rc file:

  Style "*" ClickToFocus
  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

Please note, that in 2.2.x versions the line defining Alt-Tab does not
work on systems (like mine) where Tab generates ISO_Left_Tab. This is
fixed in 2.3.12.

Yes. This is what I meant originally.

Out of curiosity does the dummy mkfifo pass the POSIX compliance test?
I would assume not. Hence there should also be a way for the configure
script to check whether or not mkfifo works. How much of FvwmCommand
works without mkfifo? Is it possible to code an alternative version of
mkfifo that would work with cygwin using some trick? The alternative
version would then be compiled in conditionally.

Yes, this would be good.

Hello,

I ran fvwm2's configure on the latest net release of cygwin and I got a
message in a windows dialog box saying that the file libXpm.dll could not
be found in the specified path. For some reason it looks like the cygwin
team decided to place many dll files including libXpm.dll under
/usr/X11R6/bin or cygpath -w /usr/X11R6/bin to be precise.
Perhaps this decision was made because the windows Path
variable is used to point to both dll files and executables.
I resolved the problem by doing the following before running
the configure script:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin

IMHO either fvwm2's configure should look in that place for the
file or cygwin should come with a preconfigured PATH variable including
thedirectory /usr/X11R6/bin as xpm is part of the cygwin package.
No other errors were encountered when installing fvwm2!

Thanks!

Neil

You run them from .fvwm2rc directly or by binding to Key, Mouse or menus.
You can also run them in FvwmConsole interactivelly.

  # press Alt-F12 to run FvwmConsole
  Key F12 A M Module FvwmConsole

If you ask how to run FvwmCommandS (a server for FvwmCommand), simply put
this word in your .fvwm2rc or start it from StartFunction, where you start
all other persistent modules:

  AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmCommandS

Then from the command line (shell, not .fvwm2rc) execute:

  FvwmCommand 'Next (xterm) Move w+2 w+2'

For your information, this bug was fixed in FVWM today.
Still this Style line may help if you don't like GNOME panel moving itself
from layer to layer and want it to stay on the layer of all other windows.

Hello,

I'm currently looking for a little soft that enables my users to have
"icons" just like KDE, Gnome or Windoze on their desktop.

Is it integreted in FVWM or is there a small software that does that?
I'm looking in Fm but there's nothing interesting...

Currently, the cygwin-Xpm package installs libraries and dlls in the standard
/usr/lib /usr/bin /usr/include locations.  However, the cygwin-xfree
distribution ALSO installs libs and dlls related to Xpm into the standard
location for X libs: namely, /usr/X11R6/bin, /usr/X11R6/lib, /usr/X11R6/include.

Yes.  This is a duplication.  Duplication is bad.  I know.  I'm working on
fixing that.

I included Xpm in the "non-X" part of cygwin primarily because *my* Xpm
distribution contains a "no-X" version of libXpm.  I added the X-based version
as a bonus; perhaps that was a mistake.

In any case, *IF* you are using X-based apps with cygwin, and *IF* you have
installed the cygwin-xfree stuff (NOTE: cygwin-xfree is not an integral part of
cygwin and many people do NOT use X-based apps) -- but, if *you* do, then *you*
should add /usr/X11R6/bin to *your* path.

Cygwin should not take heroic measures to support stuff that isn't part of the
standard dist -- especially when those measures will slow cygwin down for the
rest of us (e.g. continually checking for executables in a non-existant
directory).

Thats question 7.13 in the FAQ.

I read that Windows XP abandons desktop icons for launching things
in favor of the start menu.

GNOME and KDE have stand-alone applications gmc and kfm, which enable
this functionality. These applications may be run under FVWM.

Guys,
I have been trying to install my private copy of fvwm2, but seem to
getting this error message after the compiles are done (ie. when executing
the executable).

~/packages/bin>./fvwm2
ld.so.1: ./fvwm2: fatal: libSM.so.6: open failed: No such file or
directory
Killed

I'm not a sysadmin, but I know we have the libSM.so.6 file on our system.

~>ls /lib/libSM.so
libSM.so    libSM.so.6

Do I have to give the ./configure script an option to tell it to find this
file in the above directory?

I run my ./configure already with the following options:
~/wm/fvwm-2.2.5>./configure --prefix=/users/akshay/packages/
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/include/
--with-xpm-library=/usr/local/packages/xpm/current/lib/

Your help is much appreciated,
Akshay

    See if your LD_LIBRARY_PATH shell variable has /lib in it:
        prompt>echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    If not, include /lib in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable and try
again:

    I'm assuming you're using "sh" or "bash". Tinker suitably for
other shells.

Is it possible to define mapping for these:
- move the window with Left mouse btn + control
- resize the window with Left mouse btn + alt

Why do you thing these bindings are tricky? Or the man page is not clear?

  Mouse 1 W C Move
  Mouse 1 W M Resize

You may notice that some apps (xterm, but not rxvt) do not pass
Ctrl-Mouse1, so Alt-Mouse2 would be preferable for Move, try this:

  Mouse 2 WTSF M MoveOrRaiseLower

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseLower
  + M Move
  + H Move
  + C RaiseLower
  #+ D Maximize

If it's really netscape that has grabbed the cursor, X must
release the grab after netscape is killed.  So its either an X11
bug or a different application has grabbed the cursor (the window
manager?).  Since the cursor has still the shape of the netscape
menu cursor it awfully looks like a bug in X11.  There is a simple
way to find out where the bug is:  kill all X applications one by
one from the console and see if the cursor is ungrabbed after
killing one of them.  If the cursor is still forzen after all X
applications have been killed, it must be an X bug.

Restarting fvwm2 will only help if fvwm grabbed the cursor.

That's hard to say without actually knowing where the problem
comes from.  I experience spurious lockups with XFree 3.3.x and
4.x especially when switching X servers or between X server and
console, so it may well be a problem of the X server.

Of course.  Assuming you want to click anywhere in the window to
move/resize it, add these lines to your .fvwm2rc file:

  Mouse 1 A C Move
  Mouse 1 A M Resize

If you want to bind that action only to some parts of the window
you have to replace the 'A' wit a different context (please refer
to the description of the 'Mouse' command in the man page).

I'm trying unsuccessfully to build fvwm-2.2.5 on XFree86 4.0.2 as ported to 
MacOS X, i.e. XDarwin.

Make fails with this:

Making all in fvwm
cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../libs  -I/usr/X11R6/include    -g -O2 
-c add_window.c

mode
make[2]: *** [add_window.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

Am I doing something stupid?  (Besides trying it, I mean.)  I am _this 
close_ to the Holy Grail of getting xterms under fvwm and FrameMaker (among 
other things, inside Classic) to run on the same machine.  Has someone else 
tried this, yet?  Got it to work?  Can anyone suggest a fix?

"uname -a" returns this:

Darwin split.jxh.com 1.3.3 Darwin Kernel Version 1.3.3: Fri May  4 13:46:54 
PDT 2001; root:xnu/xnu-124.8.obj~1/RELEASE_PPC  Power Macintosh powerpc

The OS is 10.0.3(4P13) on a Sawtooth G4/450DP(Gigabit).  I think I got all 
the necessary pieces of XFree86.  I know I installed the Apple Developer 
Tools disk.

Thanks!

I'd guess that your compiler isn't an ANSI compiler. I thought the
Darwin tools were based on FreeBSD-3.0, which would imply an older
version of gcc. That's an ANSI compiler. You might want to try
throwing an explicit CC variable for gcc when you configure, a la
"./configure CC=/path/to/gcc". Or possibly your cpp is broken, though
typically with gcc, cpp is simply "gcc -E". You might try overriding
CPP similarly to CC.

You must have made some mistake.  If the function were not called
then turning off

  BugOpts RaiseOverNativeWindows off

would not have "fixed" your problem.  What I wanted to say was
that fvwm does not call the function on its own when the pointer
enters a window (or receives focus).

The problem seems to be related to the "pan frame" windows, small
invisible windows that surround the viewport that are used for
page scrolling.  It seems that your problem occurs only if there
are no pan frame windows.  The corresponding code in
checkPanFrames() was a bit confusing, so I rewrote it partially.
The pan frame windows are raised from several places throughout
the code to make sure they are on top of everything else - even
above native windows.  So this is the relation to your problem.

It seems that fvwm thinks these windows are already on top and do
not need to be raised when clicked anymore.  I think I have fixed
this one.

xclock and xlogo do not accept the keyboard focus therefore they
can never be focused, and since only the focused window shows the
problem, they don't.  Try

  Style xclock Lenience

and you will see the same problem for xclock.

Um, didn't you say that the X window already had the focus?  Does
this mean that Exceed takes away the keyboard focus from the X
window as soon as the pointer moved over a native window?  Even
with ClickToFocus?  Perhaps there is some kind of auto raising
under windows.  Doesn't it bring a window to the front as soon as
it receives focus?

Hm, wasn't there any EnterNotify or ConfigureRequest?  Okay, it
seems that focusing the window triggers the problem somehow

Can you compile xterm without this option and see what
happens?

I looked into it a little.  It's worse than that: it's GCC, but a combined 
C/C++/ObjectiveC compiler with 40,000 lines of new Apple code in it.

Fortunately, there's a prebuilt port of fvwm-2.2.4 at www.darwinfo.org that 
I hope will work alright.  I'll tackle building things later.

Gotta love Google.

hi there, ol' list!

i've got a very annoying problem on which i worked already some years
ago (yes, YEARS).

i have a keyboard fetish. i only use my mouse when necessary. now i've
got my windoze key assigned to pop up a new xterm window using smart
placement. this works great, as expected. the problem now is, that i'd
like to automatically warp my pointer (sloppy focus) to the new window
and focus it there. i tried this:

AddToFunc TermFunc
+ I exec xterm
+ I next (*) focus

and

+ I next flipfocus

and

+ I warptowindow 5p 5p

but nothing works ... flipfocus brings me to somewhere else in my
virtual desktops ... 

can you help me out here?

thx a lot!

andrИ

Your problem is that the xterm is started asynchronously.  Thus,
the window does not yet exist when the warptowindow or flipfocus
line is executed.  Try this function instead:

  AddToFunc TermFunc
  + I exec xterm
  + I wait xterm
  + I next (xterm) warptowindow 5p 5p

You don't even have to warp the pointer to the window to give it
the focus:

  Style foobar GrabFocus

and then start the xterm with

  Exec xterm -T foobar

thanks dominik. this works fine for my key binding. i also have a call
for this function in my root menu. and there something quite strange
happens: sometimes it opens the window properly, then warps to a
completely different page to another xterm window ...

this doesn't make any sense to me ...

The 'next' command relies on the order in which windows were
focused.  If you start the function from a menu, the 'next' window
may not be what you expext.  To make absolutely sure you get the
correct window with next you have to give it a unique name, for
expample

  AddToFunc TermFunc
  + I exec xterm
  + I wait xterm
  + I next (foobar) warptowindow 5p 5p

  xterm -T foobar

Ahhh.  I've seen this sort of thing myself.

You could try changing "next" to "current" in the last line, but that
will only work if you have your focus settings such that new windows
automatically get the focus, and you don't have modules (eg, FvwmEvent
or FvwmAuto) changing the focus in the midst of the execution of a
function.

The best solution would be to have the "Wait" command reset the $w
parameter in its enclosing function to the window ID that it found.
Then you could change "(xterm)" in the last line to "($w)."  This
shouldn't be difficult to code or document, but fvwm2.3.x is in
feature freeze right now.

Hi all,

I have a little problem: I installed the 2.3.32 version of fvwm
(en attendant 2.4 ... ;-) and I discovered that with this version there is
no way to have asfsm by FvwmButtons: it just stay on one side, out of the
buttons panel.
Is this a general problem, or is it just my configuration?
Of course, in my fvwm2rc i converted the Buttons configuration in the new
format.

I also had another (very minor) problem: fvwmevent doesn't play any sound
when I use raise/lower with a key, or even clicking on the window bar,
whereas it still play the usual sound when I raise/lower using tha
taskbar. Any hints?

Thanks a lot

Fabio

I have installed the X-window (for Darwin) over the Mac OS X.   the twm window
manager is not good.    I wonder that is it workable for me to download the
FVWM window manager for my X-window manager and use it over Mac OS X?

Thanks a lot for your kind assistance.

Trying this myself, I see that my first suggestion wasn't right.

This does seem to work:

export LD_OPTIONS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
./configure --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/xpm/lib\
 --with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/xpm/include

Um, FvwmWinList does not have a "More..." entry.  You must be
confusing something.a  Do you mean

  Mouse 3 R       CM      WindowList

?

What screen resolution do you have?

Is there any way (in the fvwm2rc file OR dynamically at runtime) in 
fvwm2 of specifying z-ordering of windows?

Here's what I need to do:

1) I have windows A, B, C, D and E (and B, C, and D are all spawned by A 
- not E)
2) window A is always below every other window
3) window B must stay below C (whenever the two are on screen at the 
same time)
4) window D must stay above B but below C
5) window E must stay above all other windows EXCEPT windows that it may 
spawn

Is there any way of doing something this complex with fvwm2?  If not, is 
there a window manager out there that can do this?

Colin

The 2.3.x betas support "layers".
That should do what you want.

Friends -

I like fvwm/fvwm2 a lot and have generally used both on Solaris and Linux
w/o problems. *But* on my Solaris 2.6 box, the basic fvwm2 binary (ver
2.2.4) starts up okay but ALL modules Fail to run properly. They fail with
message like this even though the modules were built, installed in correct
directory and have CORRECT permissions:

[FVWM] [executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed:
/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmPager
Permission denied.

**--Furthermore, the funtion I consider Most indespensible (ability to move
between virtual desktops) appears not to have even been included with the
source distribution (downloaded from fvwm.org). That function appears to be
in module: WindowsDesk 
but there's no such module built by the installation. (configure/make/make
install)

*-Can anybody help me get these modules to work? fvwm2 leans so heavily on
the modules that without them it's no use at all. Plus CDE is nasty and I'm
stuck with it for now...

Thanks!

When fvwm2 produces this message, it has just done a fork/execvp.
The execvp should transfer control to the module, but in your case
the execvp failed, and fvwm printed this message.

The permission denied comes from the OS, so there must be some kind
of permission problem.

If you just try to run "/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmPager" outside fvwm
does that work?   (It won't run, but it should give you a message
not "permission denied".)

There shouldn't be a newline between "failed:" and
"/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmPager".  I'm guessing that you just put that
there for email purposes...

I don't know what the WindowsDesk module is.  All Fvwm module names
start with Fvwm.  Perhaps thats a module alias you use?
A common way to move between virtual desktops is FvwmPager,
but it can be done other ways, mouse, keyboard, menu.  Not that I'm
suggesting that you don't need the modules.

I had to use CDE for a day or 2, a few years back.  I didn't like
it much either.

WOW!! READ THIS: If you need to make a few thousand dollars 
REALLY FAST, then please take a moment to read this simple 
program I am sharing with you.

You DO NOT have to send $5 to five people, buy their reports or 
recipes
or anything like that. Nor will you have to invest more money 
later to
get things going.

THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO. Complete 
it in one hour and you will never forget the day you first 
received it.

The following is a plan to benefit you and your future. BE 
PREPARED TO GET EXCITED...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Read the 
following and you will agree this is a very exciting opportunity. 
Only invest a little bit of time, and your reward could mean 
thousands of dollars! Good luck!

IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!!! With two hours of work I have made over 
US$11,000 in the last three weeks..and my investment was just 
$5!!! I LOVE IT!
Thank you 11,000 x's! Julie M. St. Louis

ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW? HOW DOES $10,000 IN TWO
WEEKS SOUND? Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait 
for the
others to start working. One hour of work to get started and no 
mailing
lists!

*****************************************************************

Esquire Marketing Newsletter Gift Club This service is 100% legal 
(Refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title
18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal

*****************************************************************
*******

Here's How It Works Unlike many other programs, this three level 
program is more realistic and much, much faster. Because it is so 
easy, the response rate for this program is VERY HIGH AND VERY 
FAST, and you will see results in two weeks or less! Just in time 
for next month's bills! You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or 
more as in other programs). You should also send them to people 
who send you their programs because they know these programs work 
and they are already believers in the system! Besides,this 
program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even 
if you are already in a program, stay with it, but do yourself a 
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and 
takes a very small investment. It will pay off long before other 
letters even begin to trickle in! Just give ONE person a $5 gift. 
That's all! Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you 
will have US$10,000 in your bank account!

Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE!  Just one (1) US$5 
bill. That's your investment!!!
*****************************************************************
*******
Follow These Simple Instructions:

1) On a blank sheet of paper write "Please add me to your mailing 
list." 
Write your name and address clearly and include your email 
address for future mailings and courtesy follow ups. Fold it 
around a US$5 and send
it to the FIRST name on the list (#1). Only the first person on 
the list gets your name and a five dollar gift.

2) Retype only the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE 
LIST. Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list 
in the THIR(#3)position.

3) Send out 20 copies of this letter. NOTE: by sending this 
letter via EMAIL, the response time is much faster, and you save 
the expenses of
envelopes, stamps, and copying services. Consider this, MILLIONS 
of people surf the internet everyday, all day, all over the 
world! Fifty thousand new people get on the internet every month! 
An excellent source of names is the people who send you other 
programs and the names listed on the letter they send you. Your 
contact source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to think of all 
the possibilities! Mail, or should I say Email, your letter 
TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of your time. THAT'S IT!

To send your newsletter by Email:
1) Go to "edit" and select all
2) Go to "edit" and "copy"
3) Start (compose) a new Email message
4) Address your Email and Subject blocks
5) Go to "edit" and "paste"

After you have pasted this article to your new Email, delete the 
old header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Ect.) Now you can 
edit the
names and addresses with ease. I recommend deleting the top name, 
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then 
simply changing the numbers.
*****************************************************************
*******

THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name reaches the first 
position in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your 
gifts. The gifts
will be sent to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who 
are willing to invest US$5 and one hour to receive US$10,000 in 
cash. That's all! There will be a total of US$10,000 in US$5 
bills in your mailbox in two weeks. US$10,000 for one hours work! 
I think it's WORTH IT, don't you? GO AHEAD--TRY IT. IT'S US$5! 
EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF 
YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!

TRUE STORY -- Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift summation four 
times lastyear. The first time I received over $7,000 in cash in 
less than two weeks and over $10,000 in cash in the next three 
times I ran it. I can't begin to tell you how great it feels not 
to have to worry about money anymore! I thank God for the day I 
received this letter! It has truly changed my life! Don't be 
afraid to make gifts to strangers they'll come back to you in 
ten-fold. So, let's keep it going and help each other out in 
these tough and uncertain times.

CAN I DO IT AGAIN?
OF COURSE YOU CAN--this plan is structured for everyone to send 
only 20 letters each. However, you are certainly not limited to 
20. Mail out
as many as you can.  Every 20 letters you send has a return of 
$10,000 or more. If you can mail forty, sixty, eighty, or 
whatever, GO FOR IT!
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT. Each time 
you run this program, just follow steps 1 thru 3 and everyone on 
your gift list benefits! Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, 
there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to 
the printer or copier, and you can do it again and again with 
your regular groups or gifters, or start up a new group.  Why 
not? It beats working! Each time you receive an MLM offer, 
respond with this letter! Your name will climb to the number one 
position at dizzying rates.  Follow the simple instructions, and 
above all,PLEASE PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this programs 
success. Your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list WILL 
NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats the other 
people who have worked hard and have earned the right to be 
there.  So please, play by the rules and the $$$ will come to 
you!

MAIL YOUR LETTERS TODAY
$$$ Together we will prosper! $$$ GOOD LUCK!!!

Also, please check if the PATH variable points to the correct
FvwmPager executable.  There may be old executables with the
wrong permissions in the PATH.

WindowsDesk is not a module but a command that existed in 2.0.x
and was replaced with the "MoveToDesk" command in 2.2.  From the
2.2 man page:

       MoveToDesk arg1 [ arg2 ] [ min max ]                                     
              Moves  the  selected  window  to  another   desktop               
              (workspace, room).                                                
                                                                                
              The arguments are the same as for the Desk command.               
              MoveToDesk is a replacement for the old WindowsDesk               
              command, which can no longer be used.                             

The old command was removed because the syntax has changed.

You can do this with fvwm-2.3.x if all these windows can be
uniquely identified by name/icon name/class/resource:

  DefaultLayers 2 10 20
  Style A StaysOnBottom
  Style B Layer 4
  Style D Layer 6
  Style C Layer 8

Replace A, B, C and D with the unique title/... of the
corresponding windows and put this in yopur .fvwm2rc.

However, it is not possible to find out which window 'spawned'
another window.  Windows are created by applications, not by other
windows.  The X server does not pass the information which process
created a window to other clients.  Thus, in general it is
impossible to treat windows started from one shell differently
than windows started from a different shell.

Great!  Thanks!  Now, just a few more questions

1) Is there a limit to the number of layers I can have?
2) What is the most stable version of 2.3.x for doing this?  I currently 
have .30
3) Where is StaysOnBottom documented?

Thanks in advance!

Yes, you can have no more than 2147483647 layers.  I guess you
will encounter some difficulties creating this many windows :-)
The lowest layer you can use is 1.

The latest released one is .32 which is also the most stable one.

> 3) Where is StaysOnBottom documented?

In the man page as an option of the "Style" command:

  StaysOnBottom puts the window in the bottom layer. This layer
  can be changed by the built-in command DefaultLayers; the
  default is 2.

Actually,

  Style foo StaysOnBottom

is equivalent to

  Style foo Layer <n>

where <n> is the first argument of the DefaultLayers command (or 2
if none is given).

Dominik/Dan & fvwm2'ers -

Thank you both very much for the help. The 'make install' doesn't do such a
predictable job under Solaris, it seems. My modules problem was indeed a
Path problem, install didn't really "install" them in a sensible place. I
moved things around manually and things are working fine now....

Also appreciate the explanation re: WindowsDesk.

Best to all,

Also, please check if the PATH variable points to the correct
FvwmPager executable.  There may be old executables with the
wrong permissions in the PATH.

Hello,

I was working on my remote PC's hard drive which happened to be running
fvwm2. Suddenly I could not ping my computer. When I walked to the remote
computer the network connection was OK but instead of X I found the
following messages on the text console. I don't know if these will be
any useful but just in case here they are (fvwm version 2.3.32).
By the way what is MFT? Thanks!

These come from using the obsolete spelled out context modifiers,
like "click" instead of "C".  Current betas allow them again, but you
would do well to remove them.

You need to get the -R option into configure since you have librplay.so
installed in a non-standard place.  Check the INSTALL.fvwm file for
instructions.

Looks like Netscape trying to allocate every color under the sun with
a limited colormap.  Ignore it.

Your X server wanted to die and it was waiting for xterm to go away?

These don't appear to be from fvwm.

No, this only means there is an incorrect line in the rc file:

  Key F6 FakeClick release3

instead of the correct:

  Key F6 A SC FakeClick release3

Probably rplay is not istalled on the remote machine at all.  At
work I had to compile fvwm without rplay support because I have
fvwm installed in my home directory which is shared over the
network.  So, when I come to a machine without rplay installed I
can not even start fvwm because of the missing shared library.
Of course I could install rplay into my home directory too, but I
don't need it anyway.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

 Hi. I want to thank you all for fvwm -- I basically DISPISE the taskbar-oriented
model everyone seems to be going to (so much that when I must run MSWin I still
use NT 3.51 ;-( ). fvwm gives me (almost) exactly what I want in a WM.

 There is, tho, one trick my NT seat will do (with help from eXceed) that I haven't
been able to figure out how to get fvwm to do. It isn't a big deal, but I thought
I'd just ask whether it's possible or you'd consider adding it at some point.

 When I move the mouse off the screen while I have it over a focus-ed window which
isn't totally displayed, the window pans back into view. For example, if I have a
window which has half of itself out of sight past the right border of the screen,
moving the mouse "past" the right edge of the screen inside the window scrolls the
window left until (if I leave it there long enough) the right border of the window 
is on the edge of the screen.

 This is similar to your desktop/page-pan feature, and possibly incompatible with 
it, but I don't care for multiple-page or virtual screen real-estate. I prefer to
manage everything within the screen I can see, so I don't mind a solution that
rules out multiple desptop pages. 

 Thanks again for the great program; if this can't be done no hard feelings.

This can't be duplicated exactly without pathing the code.  But if
you can live with pressing a key or mouse button to scroll the
window back there is a solution:

  Mouse 1 tsfw CM PipeRead "move_into_view.sh $w $[w.x] $[w.y] $[w.width] $[w.height] $[vp.width] $[vp.height]"
  
Pressing Control-Alt-Button-1 over a window will call the
move_into_view.sh bourne shell script below and give it all
parameters it has to know to move the window into full view.
Unfortunately this click is passed to the application also.

--------------------- snip --------------------
#!/bin/sh

win=$1
x=$2
y=$3
w=$4
h=$5
vw=$6
vh=$7

newx=keep
newy=keep
must_move=

if [ $[x+w > vw] = 1 ]; then
  newx=-0
  must_move=1
elif [ $[x < 0] = 1 ]; then
  newx=0
  must_move=1
fi
if [ $[y+h > vh] = 1 ]; then
  newy=-0
  must_move=1
elif [ $[y < 0] = 1 ]; then
  newy=0
  must_move=1
fi
if [ "$must_move" = "1" ]; then
  echo WindowId $win Move $newx $newy
fi
--------------------- snip --------------------

Hope this helps
