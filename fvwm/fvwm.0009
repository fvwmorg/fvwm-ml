Dear All,

My name is Thomas Adam, and I have joined the FVWM
mailing list. I would appreciate it if someone could
reply to this e-mail, just to let me know that you are
in fact receiving this.

My question on FVWM is, how do I start other programs
on different virtual desktops?? I know that this has
been documented many times, but each time I try
something goes wrong.

I am using Linux Mandrake 7.0 (air). All my fvwm2 init
files are located in /etc/X11R6/Anotherlevel/ I did
succeed in starting a program called R on a virtual
desktop but the problem was, was that I was unable to
switch back to my main desktop. How do I go about
avoiding this??

Much Obliged,

Thomas Adam

Look a the man page for fvwm2 for StartsOnDesk.  There are examples there
such as

xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"

Well, it sounds like you are using the AnotherLevel package written by
RedHat.  In this case you are using FvwmM4 to proprocess the m4 files in
that directory.  In this case I expect that you have a window manager
style such as Fvwm95.  Not knowing exactly which style you are using,
there is probably a  pager in the lower right hand corner.  If you clik
with the left button on the pager it will take you to the other desk.
Furthermore if you look at the file fvwm2rc.keys.m4 you will see the key
bindings they have put together for you.   There is one there for
switching desks.

Hope This Helps,

Tom

I'm know just about zero about X.  What are X Atoms?  USE_CDE is some
shell variable I made up for my own use.  The only variable that seems
to get set (at least in shells) is DTDATABASESEARCHPATH.  I tried this
and it made no difference.  Oh well, more hunting.

Does this allow me to lower a window underneath an unmanaged window?
If not, then this doesn't really help either.

I'll ask support to see if they can tell me how rose determines how to
set override redirect.

Thanks for you suggestions,

Somehow on copy&paste from my working test to the email message, "I" was
lost. It should be, of course:

  + I WindowId $w ("VIM - *") Exec exec open-my-notes-about "$n"

Hi,

I recently upgraded to 2.3.19 (from the FreeBSD ports, which
added fvwm2-beta a while back), and didn't have too much trouble adjusting
my fvwm2rc to the new syntax.  All the errors were dumped to STDERR, so it
was easy to catch, except for the problems because of the new way panels
are done in FvwmButtons, but that wasn't too hard.  One thing, though, was
that the StaysOnTop settings I had for Fvwm* weren't being honoured any
more.  I had a look and saw this business about Layers, and decided to
test things out by saying xterms should StaysPut.  This not only made it
so that xterms stay under the Fvwm* windows, but everything else,
too!  Why did this happen?  I thought I'd have to specify StaysPut for
everything else.

The more correct name would be fvwm-beta, the package name is fvwm.

I can't reproduce any problem by using StaysPut (this is a default)
or StaysOnTop, StaysOnBottom in the current CVS version.
If you execute Style Stays* commands dynamically (say in FvwmConsole) you
should also execute Recapture, since they only affect an initial placement.

If you think there are problems, post here (or to fvwm-workers@ list)
the output of: egrep 'Stays|Layer' .fvwm2rc. Try to use the daily snapshot.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, I am back! Unfortunately I wasn't able to
post to the mailing lists during my holiday. I changed my ISP
and now I can't send mail to the mailing lists from home, so
I have been rather quiet. Sorry for that. I tried to contanct
Dan and Jason, but it seems my mails did not make it through.

I had a lot of other things on my mind in the past two months,
but I hope I can get right back to work now. Of course this
mailing problem has to be solved. Well, and there are still
519 unread mails in my inbox :-)

Niece to be back again 8-))

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi,

after a short time of inactivity (5min) my screen gets blank.
I searched the .fvwm2rc file but didnt find anything that looks like a =
screensaver.
is it the reason of using xdm as login ?


Thanks
wolfgang

No, this is a setting of the X server. You can deactivate it
with this command:

  xset s off

You can put this in your .xinitrc file, or if you like in
your .fvwm2rc:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Exec xset s off

try

xset s off

That might help

type "man xset" for information
on the xset command.

Reverse video means that you swap background and forground
colours, e.g. instead of having black letters on white
background you get white letters on black background.

You can think about X Atoms as variables stored on the X Server that
all clients can read.  dtwm certainly sets a few custom Atoms that
applications can read to detect that they are running under CDE.

With this option turned on you still can not access the unmanaged window
in any way, but you can raise managed windows above it or lower them
below it.

I bet Rational sells their products as "CDE only" and they do not
care about the conventions that apply to any X applications.  Thus,
if they do not detect CDE, they simply make the window "override
redirect" and control it themselves.  This violates the X conventions
for client behaviour (the ICCCM2) and makes their programs virtually
unusable on any other setup.

Hi there,

I want to have 1 .fvwm2rc file for both my work & home computers.
Of course there are subtle differences (mostly in the menu options
& what appears in FvwmButtons) for each environment.

I think I need to use the FvwmM4 pre-processor. I checked out
the man page but it doesn't really tell me if this is what I
need.

Can anyone tell me if I'm on the right track? If I am, could
someone provide me with some examples? (Someone's actual .fvwm2rc
file (or the appropriate portion) would be great!)

fvwm2-2.3.19 on RedHat 6.2.

Many thanks,

SCoTT! :)

running xview tools...

clicktofocus: window w/ focus loses focus while mouse over root.

This bug has always been broken, but a patch exists and is only half
implemented.

the missing patch to events.c ...

change the appropriate line to add the NumberOfScreens check.

if (ewp->window == Scr.Root && Scr.NumberOfScreens > 1)

================================

Clicking on another window has ambiguous change of focus.
This started w/ 2.3.17

Normally, in xview, a black focal point indicates that window has focus.
A grey point indicates where the focal point is, but window doesnt actually have the focus.

In 2.3.21, the first click removes focus from the previous window (leaving a
grey focal point) and sets a grey focal point in new window, leading me to
believe it doesnt have focus yet. At that point, i cant actually tell which
window has it till i start typing.

A 2nd click in the window will result in the black type-in point.
This problem didnt exist in 2.3.16.

Thanx

Hi,

You have examples on your machine already if the RH6.2 installation is
somewhat the default.  Look at the directory /etc/X11/AnotherLevel for a
bunch of m4 files which get put together to make a single .fvwm2rc file.
As for menus the magic is really done with the program wmconfig.  In
combination with a piperead command and read command in fvwm2 this could
probably be accomplished without the use of FvwmM4.  Most of the m4 stuff
in fvwm2rc.menus.m4 is for choosing icons or not, tear off button bars,
etc. in the menus.

Also the last time I compiled 2.3.21 I seem to remember a couple of
scripts which would also perform automatic menu configuration, though I
don't remember the details right now.  Maybe someone else will fill in the
details here...

Tom

Hi!

I need to make sure the # of netscape windows a user has at any
single session is limited to, say, 5. how do i make sure that this is
the case? i have other windows, there are sxpms which would be
included if i counted the # of windows open. i need to set a maximum
for the netscape windows only. 

Thanks! :)

I don't  believe there is any  way to do  this without changing source
code.

Well that's good enough for what I want.  The Rose window already
comes "predecorated" with window manager buttons exactly like Windows
95, so I can iconify it as needed.  I just need to raise and lower
windows over it.  (Well, I can always iconify it, but that's a pain.)

Certainly sounds like it.  It's unfortunate.  I hope it's an oversight
since their other applications (Clearcase, Soda) don't suffer from
this affliction.

Thanks for you help,

Well, this is possible with a little shell+fvwmrc programming.
To find how many Netscape (or other) windows are open execute:

  xwininfo -display :0 -tree -root | grep Netscape | wc -l

Use 'grep -v 1x1+0+0' or similar to ignore the first Netscape window.
Now there are 2 choices for you.

1) Define FvwmEvent with add_window like described here (for 2.3 and 2.2):

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0006/msg00382.html
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0006/msg00393.html

Your add_window callback can be like this (works in the betas only):

  + I PipeRead `verify-window "$w" "$n" "$r" "$c"`

verify-window is your shell script, which gets an id of a new window
as the first parameter, name, resource name and resource class as the next
parameters. Now, do what you want with this window: leave it, kill it.
If you want to leave it, just do not output anything, otherwise print
this fvwm command to the standard output: WindowId $w Delete.

2) You can run a cron job, which counts windows and kills (if needed)
some of them (I hate to suggest this fascist mode, poor users). :-)

xwininfo can give you id's of windows, experiment with:

  xwininfo -tree -root | grep Netscape | sed 's/  */ /g' | cut -d" " -f2

To kill (dangerous) a window giving its id, execute:

  xkill -id 0x1215f2e

Just tried xkill, it does not work well. I.e. it kills entire netscape,
rather than only one window, it does not use X delete protocol.

There is an alternative to xkill. Run FvwmCommandS in user's StartFunction
and then execute a shell command from the cron job:

  FvwmCommand 'WindowId 0x1215f2e Delete'

Mikhael.

I would suggest to use:

  Style Netscape StartsOnPage 1 1, SkipMapping

In case you want netscape to appear on the page you clicked, you should do
some programming, because there is no way to know backward about a page on
a click/enter time when a window is mapped.

It is possible to implement this in 2.3.19+ using special variables
$[vp.x], $[vp.y], $[vp.width], $[vp.height] (divide the first by the third
and the second by the forth to get page coordinates) and PipeRead+echo
to construct Style Netscape StartsOnPage <pagex> <pagey> command.
I think it would be good to have also ready to go $[page.nx], $[page.ny],
so PipeRead+echo is not needed in examples like this.

  DestroyFunc StartNetscapeOnTheCurrentPage
  AddToFunc   StartNetscapeOnTheCurrentPage
  + I PipeRead `echo Style Netscape StartsOnPage $$[$[vp.x]/$[vp.width]] \
  	$$[$[vp.y]/$[vp.height]], SkipMapping`
  + I Exec exec netscape

Bind StartNetscapeOnTheCurrentPage in your FvwmButtons or start netscape
using 'FvwmCommand StartNetscapeOnTheCurrentPage' shell command.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This method does not go with the 2.2.4 or in any case I obtain the message
"sh: vp.x: syntax error in expression (remainder of expression is ".x")" in
.xsession-error

I obtain this message in .xsession-error when I clic on the button which
launches the function StartNetscapeOnTheCurrentPage and the window does not
appear as I would like it.

 In fact I will like that the method goes for all the applications. But if
it should be defined a function as you propose it I shoed it only for the
applications as Netscape which spend time so that their window appears.

A friend had said to me to have seen on the Net how to configure fvwm2 to do
what I want but he does not remember it more.

If you have an idea thank you to prevent me. Thank you for your assistance.

Rational Rose  uses some software from Mainsoft  that  lets MS Windows
applications be recompiled to run on UNIX.

There seem to be 2 Mainsoft Knowledgebase pages that relate to UNIX
window managers:

http://www.mainsoft.com/nbase/mainwin/kb/kbmw0027.htm
http://www.mainsoft.com/nbase/mainwin/kb/kbmw0034.htm

The second page looks like it might help, try
exporting MWWM=allwm before you run your application.

You might also try MWWM=MWM.  With this it would make sense to tell
fvwm to respect MWM decor hints.

I think the fvwm-workers list would be interested in any results you
can tell us about.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

This works just fine!  Setting MWWM=allwm, Rose comes up like a normal
X app where the WM draws the borders.  With MWWM=MWM, it works ok too
except that for the main window, no borders are drawn by the WM and
Rose draws it's own borders (I have fvwm respecting MWM decor hints).
(This is correct as mentioned by the Knowledgebase pages above.)  I
don't recall what Rose looks like with dtwm, but I suspect it's quite
close to all MWWM=MWM.

    Dan> I think the fvwm-workers list would be interested in any results you

If the fvwm-workers list is different from fvwm@fvwm.org, then I'm not
on it, and for some reason I can't reach www.fvwm.org right now to
find out what it is.

Your help very, Very, VERY much appreciated!!!!!!

Since installing HP's latest Network Node Manager product v6.10 (HP
OpenView) my Linux workstations running FVWM have experienced X-Windows
lockups.  This was not occurring with previous HP NNM v5.X and Linux
RedHat v5.2.  I have upgraded to RedHat v6.2 using FVWM2.2.4-4 without
success.  Any other reports of troubles or suggestions.  I searched the
archives and could generate any OpenView or NNM hits.  Thanks

This is an obsolete window manager. It was based on fvwm-2.0.43.
Please consider to upgrade your window manager if you need support.

This list only deals with the stable fvwm version (2.2.4) and the
developement version (2.3.21). Pre-2.2 versions are not supported.

Mikhael.

I think I have made some progress on this one too.  As I
mentioned before, the fix was very broken and only cured
the symptoms.  Playing with textedit w/ ClickToFocus I
noticed this:

 1) Style * ClickToFocus

 2) Open two windows (any non-xview windows will do) and
 a textedit window.

 3) Click in one of the non-textedit windows to focus it.

 4) Click inside the textedit window until it accepts focus.

 5a) Move the mouse over the root window
 or
 5b) Move the mouse over the window that had the focus before.

==> The textedit window loses focus.

This does not happen if you move the mouse over the other
window that did not have focus before.

Elliot, is this what you mean?

I am poking around to see if I can do something about it.
Probably we can fix (5b), but perhaps we can not prevent
the textedit window from releasing focus in case of (5a).

As promised I have made a patch.  I was not able to reproduce
focus loss when entering the root window, but the patch fixes
focus loss over the previously focused window.  Elliot, please
try this patch, and if any problems persists, try to describe
them as detailed as possible.

As I said, this only can work with 2.3.19+ versions.
I see no way how it may be possible in 2.2.4, even FvwmM4 does not suply
coordinates of the current page on the desk.

It was a working idea only, you can extend it. For example it is possible
to create StartOnTheCurrentPage function, which gets 1, 2 or more
parameters like command and pattern (in quotes) and uses "$0", "$1".

A clean solution is to restore Style StaysAnywhere after waiting for an
application to be mapped (Wait pattern). This may be tricky.

BTW, maybe I should not tell how something is possible in the developement
fvwm versions, just answer, not possible in 2.2.4? What do others think?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is there any reason to suspect fvwm?

Can you log in remotely and kill fvwm?  What happens when you do that?

Hi all. I presently have the the following set:

    Key Tab A M Next (CurrentPage) Focus

Which works (almost) the way I want, alt-tab shuttling me around the
windows in the current page. But it only changes the Focus, doesn't
raise the window. I've tried:

    Key Tab A M Next (CurrentPage) Raise

But then its just switches to the next window & stops (no more
cycling).

What am I doing wrong? Or more specifically, where can I find more
detailed info about setting key & mouse sequences? I checked the man
pages, but they're a little sparse.

thks.jeff.

Please cc fvwm@fvwm.org.  There are lots more experts there.

I'd suspect X as being more likely to lock up a machine than fvwm.

When you log in, you can just kill fvwm.  If fvwm is responsibile for the
lockup, you will probably see X exit and end up back at a prompt.

If that doesn't happen, you might try the Xfree lists.

  if fvwm locks up you still can switch to another vitual console (using
ctrl-alt-Fn), 

  if that is the case, following might help:

  killall -USR1 fvwm

  if ctrl-alt-Fn does not work it is X problem (it might be caused by
fvwm though).

Do it this way:

    Key Tab A M Next (CurrentPage) FocusAndRaise
    AddToFunc FocusAndRaise
    + I Focus
    + I Raise

The man page is the only source of information.  You may want to
download the latest beta release (2.3.21).  The man page there is
somewhat better.

Hi! I'm having some trouble implementing this (pardon a newbie).

i added this to my .fvwm2rc :

*NewWindowEventCmd
*NewWindowPassId
*NewWindow add_window FuncFocusWindow

AddToFunc FuncFocusWindow
+ I PipeRead `windows "$w" "$n" "$r" "$c"

FvwmEvent NewWindowEvent

(end)

i'm really new with this stuff, and i've been reading everything i can 
find on the web, but i cant find what those variables "$w", "$n", etc 
are or where/how i can get them.

this is my windows script:

#!/bin/sh

info=$(xwininfo -display :0 -tree -root | grep Navigator | wc -l)
if [ "$info" -gt 3 ]; then
	FvwmCommand WindowId $w Delete
fi

(end)

i'm almost 100% sure what i did was incorrect. i dont get what u 
mean by printing "WindowId $w Delete" to standard output too.

Thanks!

Implementing something non-standard or unknown always can be problematic.
I suggested two solutions (in 2.2.4 only an idea with cron job may work),
but you should choose yourself their implementations to match your needs.

A missing backtick at the end of this line is a typo, right?
Also probably rename FuncFocusWindow to FuncVerifyWindow just to be clear.
This FvwmEvent implementation only works with fvwm betas, you know.

> FvwmEvent NewWindowEvent

Here you start an FvwmEvent's alias NewWindowEvent, but you define a
configuration for another alias NewWindow (*NewWindow lines above).

You can find an explanation about $w in the fvwm 2.2.4 man page.
Other variables are new and explained in the current beta man pages.
When you are viewing a man page, type: /\$w <Enter>

This line is incorrect. $w will be interpreted by sh as an empty string.
You can use $1 (window id), $2 (window name), $3, $4 in the shell script.
Also FvwmCommand(1) gets only one parameter. So the line could be:

  FvwmCommand "WindowId $1 Delete"

But you should understand what happens. You call this script within
PipeRead, it usually only makes sence if the script outputs something.
My intend was (please reread that message) to call FvwmCommand from
a cron job and here to print a fvwm command.

Also 'windows' script and FvwmCommand should be in your unix path, or
you can specify their full paths. Errors can be found in X Server output.

Try in the script: echo "WindowId $1 Delete"

yup, i decided to use FvwmEvent implementation. however, my version 
of fvwm is 2.2.4, and we cant install a beta version. does this mean 
i'll have to use force, i.e., use cron to kill the new window? but 
that isnt a good way to solve the problem, right?

i guess i misunderstood what i read off the archives. it shouldve 
been FvwmEvent NewWindow then, i guess.

this is where i'm lost again. this script should send something back
to .fvwm2rc's PipeRead (+ I PipeRead `windows "$w" "$n" "$r" "$c") so
shouldnt i be putting "+ I WindowId $w Delete" (without the quotes)
here below the PipeRead line? What i cant understand is how i can
send the variables from the shell script back to .fvwm2rc or should 
i not be doing that anymore?

i used the FvwmCommand solution. if it doesnt work for 2.2.4, i 
guess i'll have to switch to the cron job implementation.

I gave up to explain and decided to do your homework. :)
Here is a solution for fvwm version 2.2.3 and up. It works surprizingly
well for me, but as I already said, for the betas I would implement more
correct, faster and less hardcoded solution.

Create this $HOME/bin/verify_netscape_windows script:

#!/bin/sh
: ${DISPLAY=:0}
NUM_LIMIT=6
num_total=`xwininfo -tree -root | grep Netscape | wc -l`
if [ "$num_total" -gt $NUM_LIMIT ]; then
	num_tokill=$[$num_total - $NUM_LIMIT]
	for wid in `xwininfo -tree -root | grep Netscape | \
	sed 's/  */ /g' | cut -d" " -f2 | head -$num_tokill`; do
		FvwmCommand "WindowId $wid Delete"
	done
fi

And add this line to your fvwm2rc (without 2 leading spaces):

  AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmCommandS

There are 3 choices now (after restarting fvwm):
1) run the script verify_netscape_windows manually
2) run the script verify_netscape_windows from a cron job
3) run the script verify_netscape_windows automatically when fvwm places
a new window. For this to work, add the following lines to your fvwm2rc:

  *FvwmEventCmd Exec
  *FvwmEvent add_window verify_netscape_windows
  AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent

Tested for fvwm 2.2.4 & 2.3.21, Netscape 3 & 4.

Regards,
Mikhael.

WOW! thanks! it worked! i wouldnt have written this kind of code (i'm too
new into this). i didnt even know till now that some of those commands u
used existed. i made some slight modifications, and i'll be doing a little
tinkering with it too, since i want to output a small window to inform the
user that his new window is about to be killed. if i get that done, 
i'll paste it here. again, thanks so much :)

Hi,

This is the second message I send to this list. The first I think was
rejected because a  .tgz attachment. (?)

If anybody want some configuration files that make fvwm2 look like Sun
CDE, and more... just let me know and I will send them to you.

regards,

Hello,

   I'm running FVWM-2.3.22 under RedHat Linux 6.0.

   I'm also running the nice little 'unclutter' utility:

      http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/contrib/libc6/i386/unclutter-0.8-4.i386.html

   which makes the cursor vanish after a short period of inactivity.

   However, 'fvwm' and 'unclutter' have a small problem interacting with
   one another --- if the cursor is on the side border of a window,
   and 'unclutter' has made it vanish, then pressing a key which has
   a 'Key' binding does not actually invoke that binding; instead,
   it just echoes that key into the window.

   For example, with the binding:

      Key  m  FSTW  M  Maximize 100 100

   pressing Alt-m when the cursor is on the side border and has vanished
   simply causes the letter 'm' to be typed in the window, rather than
   resulting in the window being maximized.  If Alt-m is pressed before
   the cursor has vanished, then the window is indeed maximized.

   The problem remains even when 'Key' is changed to 'PointerKey',
   and under both 'MouseFocus' and 'SloppyFocus'.

   Even after the cursor vanishes, the given window STILL RETAINS FOCUS;
   its borders are still highlighted, and the keys which are pressed
   are echoed into it.

   I do not know if the problem lies with 'unclutter' or with 'fvwm'.
   I read through the 'unclutter' source code, but I know very little
   about the details of X-windows programming, so I could not spot anything.

   Finally (!) my questions: has anyone else come across this problem,
   and does anyone have a work-around to it?

   If the window still has focus, should it not correctly process the key?

   Thanks for listening!

Cheers, Joseph

Well, what you are witnessing is an artifact of how X manages cursors.
When you have a cursor what you have is a square either 32x32 or 64x64
depending on your Xserver.  When you define some graphic to be your
cursor in the bitmap you define a hotspot.  That is to say given this
large square moving about the screen X events are looking for a single
pixel as the cursor location and that is the hotspot.  What unclutter
does is replaces your cursor with a masked square and for good or bad it
uses the upper left I believe as the hotspot (the default).

So if your cursor is on the edge of a window and then morphs to a square
your cursor position may change as far as X is consered.  So whether
this is a bug or not and where it is entirelly up to your desires and
to an extent your fvwm focus policy.  I'm a sloppy focus kind of guy,
and have happily used unclutter for going on 4yrs yes I just checked my
binary mod time and it has been 4yrs.  The proper fix would be to get
the current hotspot just before masking your cursor and then placing the
hotspot in the same place in the "invisible cursor".  Of course this fix
would go in unclutter and since I haven't seen and update in ages nor do
I recall who wrote it my suggestion would be to find someone motivated
to fix it.  Or to use this as an opportunity to learn some X code.

  this does not seem to address the problem he's having - the window
still has focus and in fact gets the keyboard events, it's just that
fvwm does not process them (the ones that are defined as shortcuts). it
does not look like there is a problem of a 'moved pointer'.

Hi

I'm quite satisfied with my settings except for two things. When I open a new
window (Xterm, emacs whatever) it doesn't automaticly recieve focus. This is
especially annoying when programs use pop-up boxes for verification of
questions. Is there any way to enable this?

The other thing is xconsole. Xconsole gets started from xdm as a deamon
process on a specific place on the screen. When I log in it is iconified which
is not the intention.I have fidled with Style StartNormal to make it start the
normal way but whithout luck. Also I would like to resize xconsole and
possibly move it when I log in however that doesn't seem possible. Anyone got a
hint?


I'm using OpenBSD 2.7 with fvwm 2.0.46

Sven,

   Add  GrabFocus  and GrabFocusTransient  to your default 'Style'.

   See the man page.

   You may need to upgrade your fvwm to a more recent version than 2.0.46,
   I think GrabFocus and GrabFocusTransient are fairly recent features.
   You should consider upgrading anyway, the more recent releases
   are really a lot nicer than 2.0.46.

Cheers, Joseph

I think it *does* explain the behaviour.  If the hotspot is moved
into the client portion of the window or if the hotspot moves into
thze root window (with SloppyFocus only), all further keypresses
go directly to the client window, not to the borders.

  I don't remember exact definition of the shortcut, but with the
following one:

Key F9    A    M    Iconify

  it works no matter where exactly the pointer is, as long as the window
has focus... it would explain the behaviour if the shortcut was specific
to border (or title) only. perhaps that is the case in this specific
case (pun sort of intentional:-).

Dominik,

   Ah, but the problem still arises under 'MouseFocus'.

   My current guess at what's happening is that the cursor hotspot
   has indeed left the application window, but because of the way
   in which 'unclutter' caused this to happen, fvwm has not noticed
   that the focus has changed, since there has been no explicit movement
   of the mouse.

   How does that sound?  I'm only guessing.

Cheers, Joseph

Hello,
	I have this nice 1280x1024 monitor. the catch is that it is 
	B&W Monitor ie no gray scale, just B or W. and dithering.

	I'm not sure but I think fvwm? default settings are reasonable to
	work on such monitor, right? This is what I had in past and
	it worked reasonably well. However, after I upgraded from 
	debian 2.1 to 2.2 all setting are fubared. Debian seems be totally
	inconsiderate to the rest of the world :-(.

	I tried to get around this by getting my own copy of fvwm2 and
	putting in /usr/local/fvwm2/ and use that instead but things
	are still screwed up. Thus I was wondering if anyone has
	suggestions where to look for prefedined colors.


	suggestions?

Hi all. While testing procmail I lost the messages I was keeping from
previous posts, so thanks to those who helped me start off down the
happy road to mouse-less operation!

Here's what I've been using so far with good success. Any comments &
suggestions are more than welcome.

thks again.

Sorry to reply to my own message, but there was one question that I
wanted to ask that I forgot. The PrevFocusAndRaise & NextFocusAndRaise
functions that i (slighlty) modified from your suggestioms _work_, but
they're really slow. It seems the raise operation (?) takes a long
time (a few second pause). Is there anything I can do about that?

Right now I'm unable to reproduce the delay, but aren't there too many
"Next (CurrentPage)"'s there?  Try using one in either the function or
the key binding.

I think fvwm works correctly here but netscape is broken.
In your config you have:

  Style * NoPPosition
  Style * RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

In other words: you are using CleverPlacement and tell fvwm to
ignore program specified size hints.  But if you issue a line
like

  $ netscape -geometry 1268x987+0+0

Netscape claims the provided geometry is *program* specified,
not *user* specified.  Thus, fvwm ignores the given position
and looks for one using the CleverPlacement algorithm.  Please
try if

  Style Navigator UsePPosition

fixes your problem.

Hello,

I'm missing a feature in fvwm2, namely StaysOnBottom.
I have several windows that I normally don't want to get in the way of
others, so it would be convenient if those could just stay below all
others. Is there a possibility that this will be implemented or is there a
function/whatever that does that?

Christoph

That functionality can be obtained in the development series with the
Layer stuff.

Hi, I am new to this list, but I do like fvwm a lot because it is so light
and fast and yet powerful and I prefer to use it instead of the bloated
windows managers installed by newer versions of RedHat Linux (which we use as
the Linux distribution here)

Anyway, I was very pleased with a feature which was present in version 2.0.xx
of fvwm2 but it doesn't seem to be there for more recent versions ( I haven't
tried the v2.3.xx yet).  With the newer versions I cannot make the taskbar to
display the application windows for the _current_ disjoint desktop only, in
other words it seems to me that there is no way to setup multiple disjoint
desktops each with a separate taskbar behaviour, as now the taskbar displays
all the active applications opened in all the independent desktops at once,
which is sometimes very incomfortable for me. As a result, I had no choice
but to uninstall the fvwm v2.2.xx which comes with RedHat 6.x and "downgrade"
to a 2.0.xx version that I took from a RedHat 5.2 distribution. I checked the
development history information at fvwm.org and I couldn't find a reason or a
mention of this feature being removed from fvwm2.

Am I missing something here? Was this feature (of FvwmTaskBar, I guess)
removed for good? Maybe I just don't know, for the new versions,  how to make
the FvwmTaskBar to be desktop-specific and display only the applications
opened in the current disjoint desktop...

Thank you for any hints about this.

Its back in the latest beta releases:

     *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly
          Tells FvwmTaskBar to show the windows that are only  on
          the  current  desktop.  When desktops are switched, the
          list of windows changes accordingly.

Hi there! I'm going crazy over this problem: please help!

I need an instance of Netscape invisible to my Taskbar, running =
fullscreen (like MS Active Desktop) for a kiosk system based on fvwm95 =
and Netscape (3.0 at the moment, maybe 4.7 later). So far no prob, =
simple 'Style "Netscape" WindowListSkip'.....

On the displayed webpage (which is now my Desktop) I have a link to open =
a new Netscape to Browse the Internet ('su' to a different User for =
Bookmarks, prefs etc.).... the problem is, these browser-windows have to =
be visible to the Taskbar, first thing I tried was calling Netscape from =
a script (not called Netscape), giving the script different styles - OK, =
it didn't work, thats a shame, it would have been so easy ....
Then I tried changing the X Resources of the Netscape Window (either =
Class, Title, Name or simply the WindowListSkip resource), but I fear =
I'm not doing it right ..... (e.g. I tried calling stuff like 'netscape =
-xrm "Netscape*WindowListSkip: No/Yes') ....

The documentation on X resources are really poor, or can one really only =
change colors and fonts???

Is there any way of having taskbar-visible/invisible occurances of the =
same Prog (Netscape) at the same time on the same desktop (remember they =
are run by seperate users)   ????

Another possibility is of course to use a different Window-manager, are =
there any that support what I want to do ????

That approach is a non-starter.

That's also doomed to failure. Fvwm pays no attention to X Resources.

You can change a *lot* with resources. But you can't change FVWM's
behavior with them (except in some interesting corner-cases).

After fiddling with your problem quite a bit, I've determined that
your best bet is to do some stuff with the initialization builtin
function in fvwm. I imagine something like:

+       "I"     Exec exec netscape
+       "I"     Wait Netscape
+       "I"     Style Netscape WindowListHit

will work if you throw it in your initialization function. N.B. I
don't think fvwm95 has a Wait builtin. Basically, what you're doing is
running the first netscape at fvwm's startup, waiting until it gets
styled with normal settings, and then changing the styling back to
normal.

> Another possibility is of course to use a different Window-manager,

Yes, fvwm2.2. fvwm95 is hopelessly neglected (it was a forked project
that is no longer maintained by anyone. fvwm2 is very much alive, very
much under development, and provides a Wait function.

Sorry, Michael, it is not a solution. Please don't even try this. :)
Even if some fvwm version allows here two Netscape windows to have
different styles, it is more than temporarily.

  1) On Recapture all your Netscape windows will do the same
  2) Since this is in InitFunction, this for sure will not work on Restart
  3) This can't work in 2.3/2.4, where the last line is evaluated for
  both existing and new windows, i.e. all Netscape windows do the same

The real solution is to try to have the second Netscape with a different
resource/class. I didn't find how to do this using -xrm or Netscape.ad,
but this does not essentially mean it can't be done. However I just edited
the netscape binary and successfully replaced Navigator by Myvigator...

Regards,
Mikhael.

I've got two configuration questions that I can't seem to find answers
for.

First, how do I change the shadow color for borders?  Ideally, I'd like
make it the same color as the rest of the borders (thus giving a
flat/non-bevelled look).

Second, when using sloppy focus is there any way to auto-raise a window
without using FvwmAuto?

Thanks in advance...

In 2.2.x you can not choose the shadowe colour individually. But
in your case you can use flat borders. Look for the 'flat' option
of the BorderStyle command.
In the 2.3.x beta releases you can control shadow and hilight
colours by using colour sets (look for 'colorset' in the man page).

No. That is what FvwmAuto was made for. Well, you could use FvwmEvent,
but this is even more complex and will work much less reliably.

AHA! Thanks to an unrelated message posted by Jerry Alexandratos
asking how to turn off FvwmAuto, I now have what I was looking for. By
using the following combination:

--
AddToFunc InitFunction
+             "I" Module FvwmAuto 0 Raise Nop
AddToFunc RestartFunction
+             "I" Module FvwmAuto 0 Raise Nop
Key Tab     A       M       Next (CurrentPage) Focus
Key Tab     A       C       Prev (CurrentPage) Focus
--

I now have my quick focus&raise. I'm guessing that the default raise
delay is 200ms or so? :$}

Thanks all, especially to Jerry. It pays to skulk!

This is what I use:

" Note that deletion will delete one space at a time.
" To enter a real tab, use  CTRL-V TAB.

The XYZZ-Homepage is up again (with an excelent fvwm-configuration).
the new adress is:
http://xyzz.omnipotent.net/fvwm.php3

As I couldn't find the email-adress of the webadmin an the fvwm homepage,
i decided to send it here, so the admin can read it and update the Link of
the Scott Scriven site to the named above.

Heh..  I forgot I had that page.  :)

The xyzz.omnipotent.net site was just a test, and is definitely not
permanent.  As soon as I get a working webserver to use, it will be up at
xyzz.org, which should be its final resting place...

I haven't actually used fvwm for a while, but I'd be happy to keep hosting
the configuration I made.  Also, if anyone has improvements, I could put
those up too.  I just need to get a working webserver first.

Fvwm web page updates are handled by sending mail to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
(This list is OK also.)

I assume you don't want the link identified as "Scott Scriven's theme page".
How would you like the link identified?

Hi,

I just switched from fvwm to fvwm2.2.4. I configured it look the same as
the old one.

But there're two differences:

A sticky window doesn't stay activated when switching from one Desk to
another. I have to go out of the window and in again to reactivate it.


Menus stay on the desk until I press another button. In fvwm, they
disappeared when releasing the button. (I liked this more, but I'm sure
I simply missed an option.)

Thanks in advance,

Heiko Klein

I suppose you mean, from fvwm version 1.24 to fvwm version 2.2.4.

I just tried with 2.2.4 to issue the Desk command bound to a keystroke and
a Sticky window indeed looses focus. This is fixed in the current betas.

Use the Popup command instead of the Menu command to bring your menus.

Hi,
	I think lotta guys have asked similar questions. My problem is when
I resize or move my window within fvwm, the rubber-band window is not
visible (I know about the XORvalue option). One interesting thing is that,
the rubber-band window comes for some times at the start of my x-server (I'm
using X-Manager in winNT 4.0), later (I do not know when) it stops
displaying it. I tried different values for XORvalue, with no result. I'm
using fvwm1.24r (I've tried the latest fvwm, even that shows the same
problem).

Any helps are appreciated,
-Arun

You should really upgrade to the latest stable release (2.2.4).
The 1.x versions are ancient past and have not been maintained
for several years.

Hi: I've been messing around with pixmap 'skins' for fvwm-2.2.4 [w.
debian patches (2.2.4-2)] and I noticed that neither the title-bar sort
of things under icons, nor the buttons on FvwmWinList used the pixmaps
for their backgrounds: I've nosed around in the code a little, and I've
figured out how to make this work [Ok, I _have_ made this work - although
I had to add some extra config parameter parsing to FvwmWinList]: 

Is there anyone who'd be interested in patches, or have I trespassed on
someone elses territory or is it just something that's in the latest
version anyway?

You should really not even bother with 2.2 for this.  There is _all_
kinds of support for theme-like stuff in the 2.3 betas.  It's really a
waste of time to try to shoehorn this into 2.2.

Check the 2.3 betas, and also the fvwm-themes package (I think you can
get it from SourceForge).

My XWindows has to be restarted just to get my windows in their right
positions. the only applications opened upon startup are netscape and
3 sxpm windows (to act as graphical overlays to parts of netscape
that i DONT want the user to be able to click on). Upon first startup
of Xwindows, or after i changed something in my .xinitrc, the xpms
are on the wrong positions! After killing X and starting it again
(there are times i've had to do it twice or thrice), the xpm's (using
sxpm's) are in the right places already. i've read that fvwm and sxpm
dont work together well, and the solution was to add "sleep
<seconds>" after each call to sxpm in the .xinitrc file. i did that,
and that's still how my windows look. this is surely fvwm's problem,
but i have no idea how to solve it. does anybody know what i can do
about this?

You should always mention version numbers.

I looked at sxpm in the xpm package version 3.4j.

sxpm.c reads the geometry argument, but doesn't set x/y coordinates.
The problem with geometry is in sxpm, not fvwm.
It might not be hard to fix sxpm.

If you mention the version of fvwm you are using, it might be possible
to make fvwm move the window to the location you want after its
created.

oops sorry.. i use fvwm 2.2.4 and in my .xinitrc, this is how i call 
the sxpm windows:

sxpm -geometry +22+0 /home/czarina/pet.xpm &

when i restart XWindows, the sxpms are in their correct positions 
already, but never on startup.

Thanks! :)

    I'm sure there's something legitimate going on here, but I don't
understand it and would like to work around it.  I'm running a program
that pops up a window of a certain size.  When I resize it smaller, it
uses it's own scroll bars.  When I make it larger, it grows to the
original size and then doesn't let me make it any bigger.

    Is there any way to force this window to grow larger?  I would think
so, since a colleague running Sawmill is able to resize the window
larger.  I'd like to know how to do it in Fvwm 2.2.4.  Thanks.

P.S.  I'm not subscribed, so please make sure that replies are Cc'ed to
me.

If you run 'xwininfo -size' on your window, you will see something like:

I don't think it is possible in 2.2, the program wishes are respected.
In 2.3 versions you can force resizing of, say, gnome-run window by:

  Style "gnome-run" ResizeHintOverride

Like Dan said, sxpm does not set any position hints, so fvwm can know
nothing about your +22+0. The bug is in sxpm.

Here is what happens. sxpm does not itself manage -g (-geometry) argument.
I suppose it is done in XtInitialize(), because there is no other places
in the source where it can be managed.

When sxmp is run under fvwm (or other wm with own placement policy), fvwm
places it accordingly to your *Placement style options, since there are no
any program or user position hints. Can be verified with 'xwininfo -size'.

But when sxpm is run outside of wm (or before it), the -geometry flag
*is* applied. Add 'sleep 10' without ampersand to work around sxpm bug.
Without (or with small) sleep, it is not guaranteed that sxpm will be
mapped before fvwm is run, so you can get random results, like you did.

Regards,
Mikhael.
