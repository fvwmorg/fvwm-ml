Hi all.

Is there any way to set a centered image as background? I don't want
FvwmBacker to tile or scale the image and I don't know how to do it.

TIA

I confess that I'm using the standard FVWM2 that came with SuSE 7.1, so 
I don't have the current program, but I have resisted moving to either 
the standard GNOME or KDE desktops because of familiarity and the small 
footprint of FVWM.  SUSE 8 is on the way in the mail.

Is there a utility which would create menus (either Buttons or the 
standard mouse menus) from a directory of links on the fly?  It sure 
would be nice if I could alter my menu structure simply by moving links 
and icons to a specific "~/FVWM_Menu" directory, rather than dealing 
with .fvwm2rc.

HI!

I've been tweaking my fvwm setup and have been looking
quite a lot at cde/motif. One thing I saw in that setup
is a 'double inset' around the inner rim of the window
border. With the current mwm border style, the client area
of the window appears sunken relative to the title bar and
window border. When a second inset, with reversed colors is
displayed, the client area appears on the same level as the 
title bar, ie 'raised'. This looks really good for 
dialogs and other windows containing gui elements. Please
compare the two dialogs in the image below, one without
double inset, one with double inset:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/inset.png

Maybe this would be a nice and not too difficult feature 
to implement some time.

best regards

jos

There are 2 shells in the utils directory:

fvwm_make_browse_menu
fvwm_make_directory_menu

that demonstrate how to make a menu from directories.

Maybe, those shells will give you some ideas.

It is a function of a client window to draw the main area raised, lowered
or flat. Only client knows which shadow and higlight colors to use (based
on the background), FVWM has no any idea which colors to use for the
"raised client" effect.

Also a menu may be drawn even more "raised" by a toolkit.

BTW, why don't you use border handles, real CDE has them. :)

Mikhael.

HI!

(wow still working late..)

Yes I guess you are right, maybe I should look at the 
gtk-theme engine for doing this instead...

About the border handles, in cde, normal windows have them,
but popup dialogs don't. The image I referred to in my mail
was a screenshot (edited) from a cde session. Is there a way in fvwm
to give popup dialogs a different decoration?

regards

jos

If you have Style * MwmFunctions (as opposite to NoFuncHint), windows
with the no-resize hint are automatically drawn without handles (like
with NoHandles).

One way is to invoke a suitable program as part of starting X.  For example I
have

xloadimage -center -onroot /usr/local/X11/images/earth2.gif &

in my .xinitrc just before exec'ing fvwm.

Hi there,

is it possible to achieve that fvwm ignores certain windows completely
while placing others?

I configured fvwm that it pops up a xmessage for 2 seconds when it
starts a program to show that something is happen:

AddToFunc FuncStartProgram I Exec echo Starting $0 $1 $2...>> /dev/console
 + I Exec xmessage -timeout 2 -button "" -name SplashWindow -geometry +0+0 "Starting $0 $1 $2..."
 + I Exec $*

This "SplashWindow" should stay on top and it should be ignored by
placement algorithm: 

Style "SplashWindow" NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, \
		     StaysOnTop, Sticky, WindowListSkip, NeverFocus

Is it possible to get this window ignored by while placing other
windows? 

The second question I have is also about window placement. I have
asked this question before and it was said to be possible in version 
>2.5.x but I have not idea how to set this up. 

My desktop looks like this:

+----------------+---+
|                |   |
|                |   |
|                |   |
|       1        | 2 |
|                |   |
|                |   |
|                |   |
+----------------+---+  
|         3          |
+--------------------+

Where 1 is the main area, 2 is a button bar and 3 is the taskbar. I
would like to set up fvwm that is places new windows only in area 1. 

Any suggestions how to get this work?

Thanks.

Uwe

No.  On a multi screen setup, the application chooses the screen
it comes up itself, usually the screen from the DISPLAY variable.
With Xinerama, there is only one logical screen that is divided
between several monitors.  Fvwm knows the boundaries of them and
can place windows appropriately.

Hi,

=09Is there a way to sticky a window (a fvwmbutton in fact...) to a deskt=
op? I=20
mean, I want it to sticky to single desktop and not all. Since a lot of u=
s=20
use to use 2 or 3 desktop to programing/net/etc, it would be nice if we c=
ould=20
use a fvwmButton for each one....

HI!

I managed to draw the 'double inset' using a little hack in 
the 'notif' theme engine. It looks really nice! One of these 
days I'll put it  on the net for download, together with my 
new cde-like setup for fvwm.

best regards

jos

It is a function of a client window to draw the main area raised,
lowered
or flat. Only client knows which shadow and higlight colors to use
(based
on the background), FVWM has no any idea which colors to use for the
"raised client" effect.

Also a menu may be drawn even more "raised" by a toolkit.

BTW, why don't you use border handles, real CDE has them. :)

Generally, no, it is not possible to make an individual window special.
But it may be possible in some specific setups, where you know that there
is only one sticky window, or one OnTop window and so on.

Offtopic. I find xmessage very configurable for a splash. Try this:

  xmessage -g +0+0 -name SplashWindow -bg darkcyan -fg white -timeout 2 -button "" -xrm '*cursorName: none' -xrm '*borderWidth: 2' -xrm '*borderColor: yellow' -xrm '*Margin: 20' 'Starting app...'

There is PlacementOverlapPenalties Style option that enables to configure
how your window is placed (not how other windows are placed relatively to
that window). But if that SplashWindow is the only Sticky window, try:

  Style * MinOverlapPlacement, PlacementOverlapPenalties 1 5 1 0 0 50

Or if it is the only OnTop window, try:

  Style * MinOverlapPlacement, PlacementOverlapPenalties 1 0 1 1 0 50

Probably it makes sence to extend PlacementOverlapPenalties to get several
more arguments, for example 2 factors for State-0 and State-1 windows.
Each window has 32 boolean window properties (states) that a user may set.
I.e.: Next (SplashWindow) State 0 true
or even (not yet): Style SplashWindow State 0 true

Report your results if you succeed.

Search for "strut" in the man page. Try:

  EWMHBaseStrut 0 62 0 63

You may do some additional work to have everything work as you want,
like placement, Maximize and so on. Report your results if you succeed.

Mikhael.

By the way, you can of course control the screen on which
windows start by modifying the DISPLAY variable.  If you want all
new windows on screen 1 for example, put this line at the top of
your StartFunction in fvwm:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I SetEnv DISPLAY :0.1

You could also write a function that calls a program that finds
out the screen number with the pointer and set the DISPLAY
variable accordingly before starting a program.  But if the
pointer moves to a different screen before the window appears
that won't work.

I see.  I finally got around looking after this problem.  The good
news is that it's already fixed in the latest code of the stable
branch.  Expect the 2.4.8 release within a week.

Style * MinOverlapPlacement
Style * PlacementOverlapPenalties 1 0 10 1 0 50

Does exactly what I want :-) Normally the splash window is the only
window which has the StaysOnTop option. But I like it in general if
windows on top are ignored by the placement algorithm.

Not for me at the moment. But maybe other users would like to use it.

Works fine :-) All other things worked already as I want.
I use environment variables to set the size of the buttonbar and
taskbar. So my actual configuration comes to:

....
SetEnv TaskBarHeight        26
SetEnv ButtonBarHeight      0
SetEnv ButtonBarWidth       66

EWMHBaseStrut 0 $[ButtonBarWidth] 0 $[TaskBarHeight]

Style * EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea
Style * EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
....

I use two different maximize/resize functions to maximize to the
"Working area" and to the whole screen:

....
DestroyFunc MyMaximize
AddToFunc MyMaximize I Current Maximize 100 100
+ I Raise

DestroyFunc ResizeToShowButtons
AddToFunc ResizeToShowButtons I Current Resize $[WindowWidth]p $[SpaceBetweenBars]p
+ I Current AnimatedMove 0 $[ButtonBarHeight]p
+ I Raise

Mouse 1 6 A Function ResizeToShowButtons
Mouse 1 4 A Function MyMaximize
....

So thank you very much for the hints.

There are 2 kinds of OnTop window, the persistent ones - you may like them
never be covered, and the transients - they may be completely ignored.

I realized that the line above causes an error message:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 18, Error 5, EventType: 0

This message is produced when starting and restarting fvwm. It is  not
produced if the line above is commented out. 
Apart from this message I have not realized  that  anything  does  not
work as expected (yet). 

Just  in  case  this  message  is  caused  by  the  command  above  in
conjunction  with  other commands I have put my actual .fvwm2rc on the
web:

Yes I see; It is now fixed in the current cvs and so it will be fixed
in 2.5.2. Thanks.

What is/are the problems? I do not think that the above message
can cause big problems. If you get any pbs, try to set the ewmh
base strut after fvwm has started.

Dear FVWM:ers!
Time to stop beeing a lurker on this list!
Am I the only one getting the CVS version to
work on a Mac? :)

I can't find a solution to get the --enable-xft aa
make it through the configure process.
And the freetype configs is not working fore me.
(Those about links here and there).
I have FT 2.1.0 build and installed.

Thank you

What status message do you get in "With Xft aa font support?".

What compilation errors do you see in config.log?

So you have the following message at the end of the configure
script:

With Xft aa font support?   no: Failed to detect freetype2 ...

may be you can help the config script with the --with-ft-prefix=PFX
and  --with-ft-exec-prefix=PFX options. Do you have other messages
during configure about FreeType 2? As I used only a 2.0.x FreeType
version there is may be a pb in the configure script. I will check.
 
Any way, the aa support used the Xft library which is specific to
XFree-4.x. I do not know if MAC OS X X server has such a library.
However, recently Keith Packard has released independent package for
Xft2, fontconfig and XRender (http://keithp.com/fonts).
Maybe these packages can be used with MAC OS X (I am bit sceptical,
but I know nothing about the internal of these libs). You may
ask such a question to the render mailing list: render@XFree86.Org
(search Xft2 with  xfree86.org as domain in the Google advanced
search engine for the archive).

No problem so far. I just wanted to say that the error message is only
thing I realized. No unwanted or unexpected behaviour :-)

There is an error in ./configure --help the correct options are
--with-freetype-prefix and --with-freetype-exec-prefix

I just installed FreeType 2.1.0, I get no pbs for the detection.

Hi, my name is Roberto Simoni.
I would like to ask:
	1) is there a configuration parameter that can disable the rectangle around the icon titles (or another that can set the flat style)?
	2) if I use the sticky style for icons is there the possibility to disable the drawing of three lines in the icon title rectangle?

Thanks for the support

Yes, you may disable 3d-effect if you use colorsets to define colors of
active and inactive title. Style * Colorset <num1>, HilightColorset <num2>
And then define bg, shadow and hilight colorset colors to be the same one.
See FvwmTheme man page for colorset usage examples. Or ask again.

No, you currently can't disable stipples. But in the future there will be
probably a conditional Style and the currently forced StippledTitle for
sticky windows will be configurable.

Mikhael.

Thanks very much, this works great. One minor improvement I could make
is if I could specify a region of the screen that FVWM should not place
any windows in.. is that possible?

The reason is that I use SLS mode on 2 monitors that have different
resolutions, so where FVWM believes that the second screen starts is
actually about an inch into the first screen. If I could prevent new
windows from appearing on that chunk of the second screen it would be
very helpful. The reason I use SLS is because I use a twin head NVidia
card, and though the drivers claim to support Xinerama, it doesn't seem
to work very well.

I would also like to take the oportunity to thank Dominik and the other
regulars on this list for always being so helpful. I've never had to
wait more than a couple of hours for a response and they are always
helpful and polite even though they must get a lot of repettitive
questions. Thanks!

Cheers,

As an additional question related to the one above - I find now that I 
have inserted the Style line you provided, the BarButtons that I use 
disappeared from it's usual position in the top right of my second screen.

It was being defined with:
*BarButtons: Geometry 30x30-5+0@1

but after adding the Style line I needed to change it to:

*BarButtons: Geometry 30x30-5+0@2

Just to get the same effect. Any ideas why?

There is now a better way.  I just wrote a new command.  With
XineramaSlsScreens you can define the geometry of your Sls
screens, e.g.

  XineramaSlsScreens 2 1024x768+0+0 1280x1024+1024+768

Just use this instead of XineramaSlsSize

HI

is there some way, for applications that don't have an icon
defined by the 'Style icon ...' command, to find out the name
of the icon that is displayed? I'd like to use this in an 
fvwm module

Not with fvwm.  The icon is provided by the application and may
be even hardcoded into the executable without any name.  Even if
it came from a separate file, the application doesn't inform the
X server about the file name.  All you can do is to search your
disk for the iconf file.

Many thanks for doing that.

I've downloaded the 10th June build and it works brilliantly - I'm now 
going to go back and hook out all my bastardised max/minimise functions 
I wrote to work round this problem before. ;)

Many thanks again.

Andy

As an addition to my last mail, I just thought I'd point out something 
that I've noticed whilst playing with it which might be useful to others..

With the above command you can define sls screens that do not have to 
cover the entire X desktop. I have 2 different size monitors but a 
rectangular desktop, so the right hand one scrolls up and down a little 
on contact with the top and bottom borders to cover the entire height. 
Using the new SlsScreens command I can specify the screens as:

XineramaSlsScreens 2 1152x864+0+0 1024x768+1152+0

And now FVWM doesn't place or maximise any windows into the bottom part 
of the screen that is only accessible by scrolling. This is very handy 
and it means I can now go back to using the proper Maximize function 
instead of the Move/Raise/Warp combos I was using and regain the restore 
functionality.

Cheers,

--
Andy

Or is it really unfeasable ?

PNG support that is only a part of a new image loading code is too big to
be backported to 2.4.x. Convert your png to xpm if you can't use 2.5.1+.

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris 8.

If I have these lines in my config file:

AddToMenu MyMenu
...

MenuStyle * PopupOffset -7 100
CopyMenuStyle * NewMenuStyle
# not yet:
#MenuStyle NewMenuStyle PopupOffset -7 100
ChangeMenuStyle NewMenuStyle MyMenu

then the PopupOffset for MyMenu is effectively 0 100.  That is, only
the second integer appears to be copied to the new style.  I must
repeat the PopupOffset for the new menu style (that is, uncomment
the second MenuStyle line) in order for MyMenu to have the desired
PopupOffset.

I don't mind putting in the extra line, but it seems redundant.  Can
anyone else reproduce this behavior?

Yes, there is a bug. It will be fixed in 2.4.8 or 2.4.9 (as 2.4.8
is at release stage).

Does anyone have any ideas on how to create smaller titlebars (left justified), that exist outside of (above) the window border/ frame?

I like the feel of pwm, but i miss the power of fvwm working with buttons and pager.  I am hoping that the infinite configurability of this wm will help me reach a desktop nirvana.  

Hopefully it doesn't involve hitting the code, i'm out of practice and visual basic has just about ruined me.  

Thanks

Unfortunately, it does involve hitting a lot of code, so window titles
that are shorter than one of the 2 client window dimentions are not
currently available.

Hello,

I am using my own Terminal Emualtor with the fvwm2 2.4.3 window manager.
I have enabled the fvwm2 as windows 95 style window manager by using the 
Rebuild Sample 95 option.

I have set Click to foucs as my style.

If my Num lock key is On and if I press Tab, then my Terminal Emulator 
windows crashes and leaves this message.

  X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  275
  Current serial number in output stream:  275

I need the Num Lock. I canot disable the Num Lock key.

I am using the XCreateWindow function to create the Terminal Emulator 
window.

  Can any one suggest me to get a solution for this problem ?.

With Thanks and regards,
L. Subbiah

Put

  XSynchronize(<display>, 1);

in your program, then single step through it to find out which
X call triggers the crash.  This usually happens when an illegal
resource is referenced or an illegal value is passed to X.  You
have to find out why this happens (e.g. the window has already
died) and take care of that situation.  If all else fails, you
have to write an X error handler that filters out this error
condition.

Dominik,

It looks like your patch didn't make it into 2.4.8.  Should it have?

It did make it into 2.5, but Mikhael had indicated it would be in both

Thanks,

Would it be possible to use an image in the titlebar, having some
transparency on the right side of it, and eliminate the buttons on the
right hand side of the window to simulate the desired look?

Clarification -- Dominik's fix (Set is_icon_moved flag if icon is
moved non-interactively.) did make it in to 2.4.8, but the new
parameters $[i.x] and $[i.y] which are used below, are only available
in 2.5.x.

That's right.  We don't put new features in the stable releases.

  Hello All

  If  I execute a tcl script from the fvwm menu
  that has the  the following line:
    "Tkxset"             Exec exec /scripts/tkxset
  It start up fine and works fine but when I push the "quit"
  button which executes the following tcl procedure

      #!/usr/local/bin/wish  #<----- First line of script
      ..
      ..
      proc quit {} {
      destroy .
      }
  the  button stays depressed and the whole root screen partially
  freezes. Partially because the mouse is still working, but the
  various applications do not respond. (i.e in focus-follows mouse
  the xterms dont' change color as I move the mouse into them,
  raising and lowering window or moving no longer works etc.)

  Now if I'm clever I'll have two xterms
  1) with the line: sh-2.05a# ps x
  2) with the line: sh-2.05a# kill

  I can add a carriage return to the "ps x", get the process
  number (cut and paste) and add it to the kill and kill the
  tk application. It does not kill the application!, or restore
  the window manager. Every thing remains non-functional but the
  usual sequence "cntrl-alt-backspace" still works so I can kill
  the xserver and start again.

  I have the following
        (These comments apply to all tk/tcl applications)

    1)  Start tkset(just a tk/tcl application) from an xterm.
        Works fine and exits fine.
    2)  Start from the root menu and use the window dropdown
        ...
        ...
        Delete
        Close     <-- this partially hangs the window manager
        Destroy   <-- closes the application
        ...
        ...

    I'm using
        fvwm-2.4.8
        linux-2.4.18
        xwindows 4.20
        glibc-2.2.5
        gcc-3.0.4
        no gnome

    I suspect that the problem is not fvwm but
    one of the other major subsystems, but who ?
    I've been using fvwm for 5 or 6 years and
    this is something new.

   Bruce

   Ps I'm behind the great firewall of China and if
   I subscribe to the list I tend to get weird things
   happening like messages from the mailing list saying
   that message are bounceing back with headers that say
   " More than ten words matched. Rejected"
   so if you could cc any replies it would be appreciated.

Mail particularly addressed to Mikhael Goikhman, as
he helped me with this one before...


Problem: trying to get pager/GotoPage "wrap-around".

I use a 4 row desktop. So I assume that the leftmost
page is page.nx == 0, and the rightmost page is
page.nx == 3. Putting the following in my rc and testing
confirms this suspicion.

Key Left  A M GotoPage 0 +0p
Key Right A M GotoPage 3 +0p

To address my desire for the wrap-around feature, you once
supplied me with the following:

Key Left  A M PipeRead \
        `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", \
        eval "($[page.nx] + 4) % 5", " +0p"`

Key Right A M PipeRead \
        `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", \
        eval "($[page.nx] + 0) % 5", " +0p"`

The above did indeed do what I meant, but I wanted to
find a way for my usual page-changing keystrokes (C-Right,
C-Left) to "just work" with the wrap-around as well.

I tried:

Key Left A M PipeRead \
        `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", \
        eval "($[page.nx] == 0) ? 3 : $[page.nx] - 1", " +0p"`

Key Right A M PipeRead \
        `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", \
        eval "($[page.nx] == 3) ? 0 : $[page.nx] + 1", " +0p"`


But this does not work. So as a debugging measure, I tried


Key F12		A 	N	Exec exec \
	`perl -le 'print STDERR "current page.nx: $[page.nx]\n", \
	"dest page.nx: ", \
        eval "($[page.nx] == 0) ? 3 : $[page.nx] - 1", "\n"'`

and it turns out (tailing ~/.X.err on SuSE) that I always see
(irrespective of which page I am on):

current page.nx: 0
dest page.nx: 3


So, probably small surprise that my attempt to use the ?: operator
isn't doing what I want...

Could my stupidity, error be pointed out? Or is it a bug?

TIA.

Michael

You should use a double dollar here instead of a single dollar,
otherwise $[page.nx] is expanded in Key command, not in PipeRead.

The strange thing is that I didn't use a double dollar in my original
suggestion at http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0204/msg00145.html
and I always test what I post.

Anyway, if you use a double dollar it works in 2.4.x and 2.5.x:

  Key Left   A C  PipeRead `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", ($$[page.nx] + 3 ) % 4, " +0p"'`
  Key Right  A C  PipeRead `perl -e 'print "GotoPage ", ($$[page.nx] + 1 ) % 4, " +0p"'`

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks for the help.  I've got Suse 8.0 on my laptop; it still needs to 
go on a server
and a desktop, but it's so much different than 7.x I'm going to go 
slowly.  I just found
out how to get Nautilus started without having it load its own background.

yeah that's what i meant.  my mouse lacks a third button; so i use
alt+right_button to move windows in pager, and "right mouse button"
was what i remembered.

in fvwm 2.5.1, MoveToPage binding was producing very odd movements
when used on a highlighted/focused window in the pager;  however,
they worked as expected when used on actual window.  i tried all the
permutations combining '0', '+', and 'p' to no avail ...

key Bracketleft   A  M  MoveToPage -1p 0p
key Bracketright  A  M  MoveToPage +1p 0p
key Slash         A  M  MoveToPage 0p -1p
key Apostrophe    A  M  MoveToPage 0p +1p


...following key bindings work just as expected w/o any problems
both on the actual window & its representation in the pager...

key Bracketleft   W  M  Move w-100 w
key Bracketright  W  M  Move w+100 w
key Slash         W  M  Move w w+100
key Apostrophe    W  M  Move w w-100


...thanks mikhael.


also ... in private mail i got the suggestion to use a key binding
to "Stick"; focus a window in a page (in virtual pager) move to
another page & press the sticking key, followed by an additional
application.  and there you/i have it -- a window transported to
an arbitrary page.

Well, it should be "+0p" not "0p", but it is still relative to the current
page, not the window's page. We miss a syntax similar to w+1 in MoveToPage.
But as you noted, it may be simulated by the bindings below.

You probably mean "the current page" when you say "an arbitrary page".
My definition of "an arbitrary page" is any (non just the current) page.

"Stick on" and the following "Stick off" may help to bring the window to
the current page (the same effect may be achieved using a single
MoveToPage without arguments), but you need "Move" or "MoveToPage" with
the proper arguments to bring it to an arbitrary page.

Mikhael.

Actually, arbitrary is correct, the way I do it (I don't use the pager for
this).  I was the one who made the suggestion to use "Stick" (which was
meant to go to the list, but I didn't pay attention, and didn't realize
that replies to the list only go to the original poster without making
extra effort; is there a reason for that?).  I use "Stick" without
arguments, which makes it act as a toggle.  The procedure is then to
activate the window, make it sticky, go to where you want it, and then
make it unsticky, using the same key or key combination (I use the left,
so-called "Windows" key and the period together).  This can be used to move
a window anywhere, not only on the current desktop, but also to any other
desktop, and can also be used to move a whole group of windows at the same
time.

P.S.  If you get two copies of this, Mikhael, it's because I made a mistake
again in cc'ing it to the list the first time.  I thought I had an alias
for the fvwm list, and I didn't.  Sorry.

Use group-reply 'g' in your mailer (mutt) instead of 'r'.

Ok, you describe a way to temporary carry a window from the old current
page to the new current page in my terminology. This is nice. Moving a
window to another page/desk without switching pages is another task.

Bingo! 

Thanks much. Perhaps this should be mentioned in some way in the manpage?
I imagine it might be close to an FAQ for some...


Cheers.

...ah, that's it!  i was expecting the movement to be relative to

It is a part of Imlib:

  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=imlib
  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=imlib-devel
  http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=ftp&q=imlib-1.9.10.tar.gz

But if you don't use FvwmGtk module with images (say, fvwm-menu-directory
may create such FvwmGtk menus), you don't need to worry about GDK Imlib.
Additionally, Imlib version 1 is replaced with Imlib version 2, and only
the first provides gdk-imlib, I think. Don't use version 2.

Mikhael.

Hi,

when I try to use xpm cursors, I can't have any shade of gray in it, like
in windoze. I understand that, due to the standard way of defining cursors
and their mask in b&w, this may not be possible.

If I migrate to 2.5.1+ and PNG support, will the cursors also be black and
white ?

Rgds,
Christian

Actually "0p", "-0p" and "+0p" are the same in this context.
Not a very intuitive syntax. I would replace it with: "w+1" (relative to
the window's page), "c+1" (relative to the current page, instead of "1p").

This is not related to xpm vus png.

Cursors have 2 colors, inner and outer, or fg and bg. By default these
colors are black and white. But you may choose any other 2 colors:

  CursorStyle MENU left_ptr yellow black

The same syntax applies to the pixmap cursors.

  CursorStyle MENU myimage.xpm red darkred

If X supports more than 2 colors, we may support this too.

Mikhael.

I'm having trouble getting a pager to appear. I'm using a .fvwm2rc
that has worked fine in previous versions of fvwm2, so I'm not sure
what I'm doing wrong. I'm running a slightly old version of fvwm
(2.2.5), but that shouldn't have any effect, unless there's a fixed
bug that I don't know about.

Here are the relevant parts of my .fvwm2rc:

DeskTopSize 3x3
DeskTopScale 32
Module FvwmPager * *

.
.
.

+    "Xmag"          exec xmag &
+       ""       Nop
+    "Pager"=09Module FvwmPager 0 0
.
.
.

        Module     FvwmPager * *=20
#        Exec    "I"     xsetroot -solid blue3
EndFunction

Function "RestartFunction"
        Module   FvwmPager * *
        Exec    "I"     xsetroot -solid Green
EndFunction

.

Hmm, this looks like fvwm version 1 systax

It should be

Function "InitFunction"
+         Module     FvwmPager * *
+         Exec    "I"     xsetroot -solid blue3

Function "RestartFunction"
+         Module   FvwmPager * *
+         Exec    "I"     xsetroot -solid Green


Note the "+" to continue a definition. And no EndFunction because + always
adds to the latest "mentioned" function.

Ok, I made that change, and it didn't have any effect. It didn't set
the root color or anything, those are the correct names for the
functions that automatically get called when you start and restart
respectively right?

I even added:

Function "StartFuncton"
+         Module   FvwmPager * *
+         Exec    "I"     xsetroot -solid Grey50

and when I re-start, nothing still happens. 

Is there some way that I can see any error messages that fvwm is
giving me?

Thanks

Brian

This is ok.

> DeskTopScale 32

You should see "No such command 'DeskTopScale'" error, don't you?
The correct syntax for 2.2.5 is:

  *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 32

> Module FvwmPager * *

Running a module before defining its configuration is not good.
Modules should be started from StartFunction (works in 2.2.5).

This is an old configuration of fvwm version 1. If you leave it as is, you
should see at least 3 errors on your standard error stream, don't you?

  No such command 'EndFunction'
  /bin/sh: "I": command not found
  No such command 'EndFunction'
  
You should also get 3 pagers running, don't you?

The correct syntax is:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Module FvwmPager * *
  + I Exec xsetroot -solid blue3

  AddToFunc RestartFunction
  + I Module FvwmPager * *
  + I Exec xsetroot -solid Green

or just:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmPager * *
  + I Exec xsetroot -solid darkcyan

No, this is totally incorrect syntax, it misses four "I" after "+"
and two existing "I" should be removed.

I'm not sure, I'm not seeing any error messages in my xconsole... I'm
not sure where else they'd be.

No, I'm getting 0, that's exactly the problem.

Ah, well at least this DOES make my root cyan, which is a start, but
still no pager.

Oops, my fault, I didn't really think, I just saw the "EndFunction" and
missing +'s....

This depends on your system setup. The error messages are usually in the
same place the X errors are. But some distributions redirect fvwm2 output
to something like ~/.FVWM2_errors.

I start X using this command:

  % xinit [params] 2>&1 | tee $HOME/x.out 2>&1

So I see X errors (and FVWM errors) in both virtual console and ~/x.out.
You may just redirect xinit or startx to a file without "tee" command.

Probably a problem with ModulePath. Can you run any module at all?
For example, FvwmConsole or FvwmBanner.

Exactly. I just found the errors (.xsession-errors) and it says:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FvwmPager' in
ModulePath '/usr/imports/fvwm2/libexec/fvwm/2.2.5:/usr/imports/fvwm/modules'

Ok, I'll track this down. thanks a lot.

Hi from Sweden!
I am the Mac user in the FVWM-world! (On LinuxPPC).
I am quite a newbie, and just recently got around with configuring too.

Is it posible that you can describe what you got on this?
And a few screensshots?

Thank you.

Can you send me the whole tk script?  Pressing ctrl-alt-escape may

Hi All,

=09I would like to thanks the help of you and specially would like to tha=
nks=20
the patch from Suzanne. It works very well :-)

=09Well.. I did get something like the Sticky to desk that so many has as=
ked=20
for. It's not a hack, but a little trick on fvwm config.

=09I use to use 3 desks, one with a horizontal fvwmbuttons, one with a ve=
rtical=20
fvwmbutton and another with nothing. The first fvwmbutton I call BBar, an=
d=20
the other NBar. On .fvwm2rc I have:

addtofunc goleftdesk    "I" gotodesk -1 1 0  2
+                       "I" PipeRead "/home/lyra/bin/ifdesk.sh $$d"      =
    =20
 =20
addtofunc gorightdesk   "I" gotodesk 1 1 0 2
+                       "I" PipeRead "/home/lyra/bin/ifdesk.sh $$d"

and the script ifdesk.sh:

if  [[ $1 -eq 0 ]] ; then

        echo "All (BBar) move 0p 0p";
        echo "All (NBar) move 5000p 5000p";
fi

if [[ $1 -eq 1 ]] ; then
       =20
        echo "All (BBar) move 5000p 5000p";
        echo "All (NBar) move 5000p 5000p";
fi

if [[ $1 -eq 2 ]] ; then
       =20
        echo "All (BBar) move 5000p 5000p";
        echo "All (NBar) move -0p 0p";
fi
=09
=09You have to bind the key you want to the functions, of course...

=09I hope this could be usefull for other people. If you find a way to im=
prove=20
it, please let me know :-)

=09Christian Lyra

   Thanks for the reply. I can send you the script but I'm not sure
   of the need. I was going to write to the tk/tcl people about the
   problem, but first I thought I would see if there were any new
   versions. There was so I upgraded from tcl8.4a3 to tcl8.4a4,
   likewise with tk and the problem went away. I rebuild the entire
   system from source every week and at one point tcl8.4a3 and fvwm
   were working fine. Then one week something (probably a new glib)
   broke tcl8.4a3. At first I thought it was fvwm-2.4.8, but I went
   back to an older version, tcl was still broken, so it wasn't fvwm.
   As I say tcl8.4a4 fixed the problem.  As far as the script goes,
   all tcl/tk scripts were broken on that term signal. I imagine that
   the tcl/tk people know about the problem but it does seem strange
   that there is a lib/tcl/gcc/... combination where signals are not
   working properly. If you need to know more about this problem let me
   know and I can restore the old tcl again.

Ah, thanks for the info.  I guess we can ignore the problem then.

With the new state bits that can be set for windows it's even
possible to have a solution that does not rely on window names:

  addtofunc togglestickondesk
  + i thiswindow (currentdesk) stick on
  + i cond (nomatch) stick off
  + i thiswindow (state 7) stick off
  + i state 7 toggle

  addtofunc mygotodesk
  + i all (circulatehit, state 7, currentdesk) stick off
  + i gotodesk $*
  + i all (circulatehit, state 7, currentdesk) stick on
 
  mouse 1 3 N togglestickondesk

The togglestickondesk function sticks or unsticks the current
window on its current desk.  That is, as long as the mygotodesk
function is used to change desks.  Thus, if for example the pager
is used to change desks, this won't work.  (The "gotodesk" command
is hard coded in the pager).

I forgot to mention that the "cond" command syntax will probably
be changed before 2.6 is released.

Today I tried to upgrade fvwm 2.2.5 to the recent version of fvwm. I have a 
bunch of tcl/tk scripts (running 8.3.2), that used to work in 2.2.5, but don't 
in 2.4.8. The problem is when I try to either center windows or to make them 
popup under the cursor. The tcl interpreter seems to get no information when to 
repaint the window. I sometimes get windows which are not painted at all (no 
widgets). This happens basically when I try to popup a toplevel window under the 
cursor. If the  window is not resizable and not closeable and I press the 
iconify button of the windowmanager the content of the window gets painted, but 
before the window is empty.
The don't close/iconify stuff is:

proc noclose win {
     wm protocol $win WM_DELETE_WINDOW { }
     wm resizable $win 0 0
     bind $win <Unmap> "wm deiconify $win"
}

the popup function is basically update idletasks following the standard 
calculation like on the Tcl Wiki page "Centering a window" http://mini.net/tcl/1254.

I had no time yet to track that down, have to do that tomorrow, but has anyone 
else encountered that problem ?

I also have experienced strange behaviour in TK applications.
Sometimes menus doesn't popup where you would expect. After moving the
window the menu appears where expected.

For example this tutorial program:

------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Create the main message window
message .m -text "Hello Tcl!" -background white
pack .m -expand true -fill both -ipadx 100 -ipady 40

#  Create the main menu bar with a Help-About entry
menu .menubar
menu .menubar.help -tearoff 1
.menubar add cascade -label "Help" -menu .menubar.help -underline 0
.menubar.help add command -label "About Hello ..." \
	-accelerator "F1" -underline 0 \
	-command showAbout

#  Define a procedure - an action for Help-About
proc showAbout {} {
    tk_messageBox -message "Tcl/Tk\nHello Windows\nVersion 1.0" \
	    -title "About Hello"
}

#  Configure the main window
wm title . "Hello Foundation Application"
. configure -menu .menubar -width 200 -height 150
bind . "<Key F1>" {showAbout}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is using 2.5.1
This doesn't happen using twm.

Marcus, do you have an idea, when this "strange behavior" was introduced. It was 
definitely not in 2.2.5, but that's a very old version and I had to upgrade, 
because I needed the StaysOnBottom feature. Versions after 2.4.8 up to the 
development version 2.5.1 you're using seem to have the bug. I'm going to do 
some testing tomorrow, i.e. compile+install some versions between 2.2.5 and 
2.4.8 to see when the bug was introduced :-(

I think I've only seen it using 2.5.x releases. If I remeber correctly I
went from 2.4.6 straight to 2.5.0.

Hi!

I like the 'flat' look of this icon set. 

I was wondering if in fvwm-themes there is somewhere a 
function that in some magic way finds an icon for a given
application, maybe through some kind of an icon-database 
or something. I'm working on an application launching 
panel, and one of the problems i face is to always find 
an icon for a given application. It is possible by using
the gnome libraries, but I'd prefer not to...


best regards

jos

Well, yes, there is an application-matching-pattern-to-icon database.
But it will not help you. There is a need in a wider application database
including name, resource strings and category. This should be enough to
assign an icon (using wm-icons categories), to automatically create
application menus and to implement application choosers for bindings and
panels like yours.

You may use GNOME or KDE *.desktop database for now, I think.
Or maybe even query FreshMeat online to get a category, I don't know.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello, friends

I am using fvwm95 2.0.43a on the SCO Unix 5.0.5 downloaded from Sco's Skunkware package but after using it the Enter and keypad Enter keys no longer cause any thing in all X-clients. Neither them nor their combinations with control or alt or shift keys no longer cause any thing in X sessions. The only place that they work, is before logging in to X at scologin username/password checking screen( first screen).

Can anyone help me how can I give back the existence of Enter key to my X session ? Any comment will be appreciated.

Good Luck

Hi all,
I'd like to configure a vertical side instance of FvwmButtons on my
desktop as an application launcher: but I'd like furthermore to have the
launching icons working as follows:

1) Double click (and not only single click) to run the application
2) Icons become shaded after clicking to wait for the application to pop up
3) When application pops up, reset icon to its pristine state


Is there a way to implement that?

Thanks a lot in advance for any help


Sergio

We can't really help much with fvwm95 because it was split off
from fvwm itself years ago.  Fvwn itself has changed a lot since
then and provides almost all functionality that fvwm95 has too.
Since fvwm95 is no longer maintained, I suggest you use the latest
fvwm release instead (2.4.8, http://fvwm.org).  It has an exmaple
configuration in the sample.fvwmrc directory of the source
distribution.  I once created it from the fvwm95 default config.
And I think the fvwm-themes package also has a similar
configuration that is easy to install (?)  Should you have any
trouble with fvwm, please do report it here.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Perhaps the manpages are making me sleepy but I'm unable
to find how to change the default icon placement for icons.

When no manipulation is set they are placed top left I'd like
to adjust this anyone point me to the correct portion of the
manapge(s)?

Thanks

I use "IconBox" to place icons where i want. An example :

Style "*" IconBox 5 -50 250 -0

All icons will be place in a rectugular area from (5,-50) to (250,-0) whi=
ch is
in the bottom left of screen.

More information with "man fvwm2" then search "iconbox", especially in
paragraph "THE STYLE COMMAND (CONTROLLING WINDOW STYLES)"

Hello,

Is there a known issue with aterm (0.4.2) or rxvt (2.7.6) ?

With this fvwmrc (and fvwm-2.4.8) :
Style * ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusPassesClickOff

the option ClickToFocusPassesClickOff works fine when I click an
unfocused aterm or rxvt, but not when I click and move the mouse before
releasing the button (the client is focused _and_ a selection is made in
it). 

A workaround would be really appreciated (I have made bad things to my
home directory, when attempting to re-focus aterm and paste some
selection in a burst, before stopping the mouse). "IgnoreModifiers L25"
doesn't help here ... 

Hmm ... I hope these explanations are clear enough. Thanks for your
efforts to understand them !

Sigh, it's another of these situations when fvwm thinks the window
is mapped but it's actually unmapped.  To debug this, I need your
fvwm config file (please strip it down as much as possible - that
saves me a lot of work), access to the application you used and
detailed instructions to reproduce the problem (a la "start app.,
click here, click there etc.").

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

P.S.:  Please do not reply to the lifebits mail address.  I will
delete that mail account in a few hours.

Hello,

As I understand it the gnome window manager specification list aims at 
expanding on and adding some clarification to the Inter-Client 
Communications Conventions Manual (ICCCM) as described at the
<http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/>. Here is one simple thing
which should probably be part of the standard:

+++ Each window must have an interior with a height of at least 1 pixel
+++ and a width of at least one pixel.

The above seems to be true under most window managers. For example if I
run 'wish' under fvwm2 I can resize the window until I can clearly see
that it is 1x1. Under the gnome window manager if I do this the drawing
of the window frames becomes really fuzzy as I make the window smaller.

Another requirement should be:

+++ The size increment should be always greater than 1.
+++ Setting the size increment to a smaller amount is implementation
+++ defined, i.e., should be avoided.

(The size increment corresponds to the PResizeInc property in
Section 4.1.2.4 of the ICCCM manual).

Forcing the requirement that all windows should be 1x1 would allow the 
specification being developed to express what should happen when an 
application sets the base size (this property corresponds to or is
related to the PBaseSize bit of WM_SIZE_HINTS.flags in ICCCM
Section 4.1.2.4) to (0, something) or (something, 0).

+++ The size of a window SHOLD be computed as follows:

Let k be some scalar factor.

s = baseSize + k * sizeIncrement;
if (s == 0) size = 1;
else size = baseSize + k * sizeIncrement;

This would solve the following problem. Consider the following Qt
application:

#include <qapplication.h>

class Foo: public QWidget {
  public:
    Foo(QWidget *parent = 0): QWidget(parent) {
      setBaseSize(0, 0);
      setSizeIncrement(2, 2);
    }
};

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  QApplication app(argc, argv);
  Foo foo;
  app.setMainWidget(&foo);
  foo.show();
  return app.exec();
}

Under the gnome, since the base size is (0, 0), gnome automatically
bumps it to (1, 1) which means that the size computations above
yield sizes of (1, 1), (3, 3), (5, 5), ...
which is not what the user expected.

On the other hand, fvwm uses the above size formula yielding what the
user expected even when the base size is set to (0, 0). This issue
should be sorted out in the window manager specification being
developed.

In the meantime, it would be wise for the Qt team to set the default
value for the base size as (1, 1) rather than (0, 0), or is there
a window manager that allows an interior window to be 0x0 ???
This should perhaps at least be done for the X version of Qt.

These things need to be sorted out and standardized because
it can really mess things up for larger applications and we
all need something to rely on.

Hi there.  I just installed Cygwin on my Win98/PIII and after using twm
decided to try fvwm2 (version fvwm 2.4.7).  I am able to launch apps and
even configured the appearance of xterm windows.  But ... contrary to
the man pages ... my windows don't have all the mouse button
functionality.  Pressing mouse button 1 (left-most?) is fine.  Pressing
button 2 (right-most) does nothing i.e. there is no "list of extended
window options".  I looked at fvwm-config and nothing seemed to address
the issue.  Any ideas what I did wrong?  Thanks.

Mike

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris 8.

I am trying to acquaint myself with the TaskBar's mail indicator
behavior, using a "surrogate" mailbox (a dummy file I have
designated as the MailBox) and surrogate mail messages (adding
to/removing from the file by hand, then deleting it).

Here's what I am seeing.

1.  The mailbox is checked every MailCheck seconds _provided_ the
TaskBar has work to do (like updating buttons due to window focus
changes).  If the TaskBar is idle, the mailbox is not checked until
the UpdateInterval timer expires.  I've found that I need to set
both MailCheck and UpdateInterval to the same low value, say 5, to
get timely mail indicator updates when the TaskBar is otherwise
idle.  I'm not necessarily advocating a code change, but some hints
in the man page as to the interrelationship between these two
parameters might be worthwhile.

[Side note:  The man page states that the default value for
UpdateInterval is 60.  It's actually 30, isn't it?]

2.  Single-clicking the "new" mail indicator unconditionally returns
the indicator to its "old mail" state.  Until the mailbox is
actually re-read, the indicator and its tooltip are in conflict.  A
nit, to be sure.

3.  In the "no mail" case, when no icon is rendered, the empty space
still sports a tooltip, and MailCommand can still be launched with a
double-click (both of which seem non-intuitive).  Perhaps TaskBar
could be enhanced to show three different icons for the no-mail,
old-mail and new-mail cases.  Perhaps all three icons could be
config options.

Hi there,

Is there a possibility to assign a Style option to an existing
window. Currently I use the Style command like:

Style "Speedbar" CirculateSkip

I would like to get a menu entry to assign a property like
CirculateSkip to a window which already exists.
Like 

AddToMenu WindowMenu 
+ "Skip this window when using (Alt-Tab)" Current Style CirculateSkip 

(I know the above is not correct, but I shows what I would like to have.) 

I would like to do same with other styles like Foreground, Background,
Hilight*, ...  

Any suggestions? 

Thanks in advance.

Bye Uwe

This FvwmTaskBar functionality was not changed for years, I think.

To improve it you may either patch FvwmTaskBar or use FvwmButtons with
swallowing a real mail notification program like xmailbox.

Yes, UpdateInterval is 30.

As for MailCheck, I see several bugs here, so it is always 10 no matter
what you configured. I may try to fix this, but I don't use FvwmTaskBar
or local email.

MailCheck always has effect if it is greater than UpdateInterval.
If MailCheck is less than UpdateInterval, it only has effect when
something is redrawn. I will documents this.

Well, you may replace minimail.xbm image in the sources.

What is your configuration for titlebar buttons?

Try this configuration for example:

  Style "*" Button 1, Button 2, Button 4, Button 6
  Style "*" NoButton 3, NoButton 5, NoButton 7
  Style "*" NoButton 8, NoButton 9, NoButton 0

  Style "*" MWMButtons  # button relief follows the state

  ButtonStyle 1 Vector 5 25x40@1 25x60@1 75x60@0 75x40@0 25x40@1

Theoretically currently you can't apply Style to only one window,
but practically you may get acceptable results. Add "$n":

  + "Skip this window when using (Alt-Tab)" Current Style $n CirculateSkip

Or replace "Current" with "Pick (CirculateHit)" if this is what you want.

Please use colorsets instead. Then you just change colorset dynamically
without a need to change any Style.

Thanks. The lines.

DestroyMenu windowops
AddToMenu windowops "Window menu"     Title

do what I want. I will see how it  goes  if  there  are  more  windows
having  the  same  name. But for the moment it does exactly what I was
looking for. 
 
Thanks for the hint.

I use colorsets. The problem with colorsets is that you need to define
them  before  you can use them. For example if you want one particular
window to appear in red color and  another  one  to  appear  in  green
colorsets  might be not that suitable, since you need one colorset for
each color you want to use.

Hello,

I'm new with FVWM and I have a question.

I'm writing a X-Window application (based on Trolltech Qt libraries, running under Linux with FVWM2). 

This application has a lot of windows. And some of those windows have more priority.

Is it possible to create an hierarchy with the different windows ? 
For example, if I have five windows:
A has priority 3 (less priority)
B and C have priority 2 (middle priority)
D and E have priority 1 (first priority)
Does somebody know how to always have windows D and E above all other,
If I select the E window it comes above D window, and if a select D window it comes above E window,
If I select B window it comes above C window but always under D and E windows (in case of overlapping), etc=85

Can it be done at the WindowManager level or at the X-Window level (properties of the windows)?

Thanks in advance

Fred

It should go to the file ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc. You said you installed fvwm
yourself on Cygwin, so you don't have a system wide configuration.
But then you said you were able to configure your xterm and have
several titlebar buttons. Did you use "Setup Script 95" or "Setup Form"
on the first start? If yes, you have some files in ~/.fvwm that are
included from .fvwm2rc file, change either .fvwm2rc or these files.

fvwm-config only gives you information of what and where you installed.

> Is there a man page for the config file?

Yes, "man fvwm2".

Mikhael.

You may want to use layers. An application may assign them using gnome
window manager hints or using extended window manager hints (EWMH).
FVWM recognizes these hints unless they are switched off by a user.

You may do it on the window manager configuration level too by defining:

  Style A_pattern Layer 2
  Style B_pattern Layer 4
  Style C_pattern Layer 4
  Style D_pattern Layer 6
  Style E_pattern Layer 6

The default window layer (StaysPut) is 4, other shortcuts: StaysOnTop
is layer 6, StaysOnBottom is layer 2

But if you write your application please rethink twice before throwing
layers on pure users. I never like that an application dictates that one
of its windows is always above others or even grabs X until it is closed.
Fortunately FVWM has all the needed defence against applications that
abuse their priveleges. :)

I think (without knowing details) that a better solution than layers is
to define window groups and/or a tree of your transients. Then a user
has more options to configure such window tree, search for "Transient"
or "WindowGroups" in the fvwm man page.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I see. Still I don't think colorsets are less suitable here than
ForeColor, BackColor and HilightFore, HilightBack.

For each color you want to use for windows (green, red) define 2 colorsets
for inactive and active window once. Then just switch window colorsets:

  # define 3 color schemes, red, green, blue
  Colorset 50 fg black, bg rgb:d0/00/00, hi rgb:ff/00/00, sh rgb:a0/00/00
  Colorset 51 fg white, bg rgb:00/60/00, hi rgb:00/30/00, sh rgb:a0/90/00
  Colorset 52 fg white, bg rgb:00/00/40, hi rgb:00/00/20, sh rgb:a0/00/80

  AddToMenu windowops
  + "Use red color scheme"   Style $n Colorset 50, HilightColorset 60
  + "Use green color scheme" Style $n Colorset 51, HilightColorset 61
  + "Use blue color scheme"  Style $n Colorset 52, HilightColorset 62

Then you may even add something like this if you really want:

  + "Make red color scheme lighter" Func1ChangingColorsets50And60
  + "Make red color scheme darker"  Func2ChangingColorsets50And60
  + "Make red color scheme more cyan" ... :-)

This changes colors of all windows that currently use red color scheme.
For versions < 2.4.8 the syntax is "*FvwmTheme: Colorset ..." of course.

Mikhael.

Sounds reasonable. 

One question is left: How would this Colorset change function look
like? (fvwm 2.5.1)

Currently you may just setup new constant colors:

  AddToFunc SetupDarkerRedColors
  + I Colorset 50 bg rgb:60/00/00, fg contrast  # inactive
  + I Colorset 60 bg rgb:a0/40/40, fg contrast  # active

It is planned (but not finally) to add TintBg colorset option that makes
this automatically, i.e. make colorset bg lighter, darker, more bluish.
I would wait until the new colorset option names (including the current
Tint that works on pixmaps) are finalized.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I thought so.

Sounds great. I think this would be a nice feature.

I have the following defined:

# and some special for TK tear-off menus
Style Menu      NoButton 2, NoButton 4, NoHandles, FixedSize

Before (2.5.1) this automatically made menu entries in the window menu
shaded (such as resize). This doesn't happen any more.
The same happens for Motif tear-off menus.

I upgraded to 2.5.2 today.

Is this a bug?

There is a typo in the file NEWS in the 2.5.2 tar-ball.

"Removed the --enable-multibyte configure option.  Multibyte
  support is nor compiled in unconditionally."

I guess it should say "... now compiled in ... "

Hi!

I've binded (bound?) Stick to a title bar button. I want to use different pixmaps in the title bar button, one for when it's not sticky and one for when it is. I tried writing a function but I couldn't figure out a way to do it.

Thanks in Advance

A glitch in active disable menu item; inactive item has a correct fg.
I didn't think it is critical for 2.5.2. It should be fixed in cvs now.

There are several more known glitches, for example on the initial drawing
of multi-desk pager (in 2.5.1 as well).

And "Style * MWMButtons". You don't need a function.

How would I tell fvwm to use mini.stick.xpm for when it isn't sticky and to use mini.stickpressed.xpm when it is sticky for a title bar button?

P.S. Sorry Mikhael, didn't mean to send this to your personally.

  Style * MWMButtons

  ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp   Pixmap mini.stick.xpm
  ButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown Pixmap mini.stickpressed.xpm
  ButtonStyle 3 Inactive   Pixmap mini.stick.xpm
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp   Pixmap mini.stickpressed.xpm
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown Pixmap mini.stick.xpm
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledInactive   Pixmap mini.stickpressed.xpm

  ButtonStyle 3 - MwmDecorStick

  Mouse 0  3  A  Stick

You may setup 6 different pixmaps, not only 2.
When I answer a question about configuring titlebar buttons, I usually
copy the buttons component from one or another theme in fvwm-themes.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks a bunch. The FVWM man page only dedicates a few sentences to Toggle* in the ButtonStyle section, so I was sure how to use it.

Thanks again.

There is little we can do about that.  It's not the click that
gets passed to the window - insofar fvwm works correctly.  The
problem is that rxvt and aterm request pointer motion events with
any button held down.  Fvwm releases the grab of the pointer after
the click is processed and further mouse events are processed by
the application.  It does not happen with xterm because xterm
requires to receive the click.

Let me put it this way:

  layers = best way to drive the user up the wall = evil

(same is valid for window that raise or maximize themselves - or
worse: both)

Transients should give reasonable results.  Lets assume B and C
are opened from A, D is openend from B and E is openend from C.

The set the transientfor property of the window to

window  transientfor
  A        -
  B        A
  C        A
  D        B
  E        C

X11 itself does not allow dimensions smaller than 1.  Any attempt
to set an illegal dimension is simply ignored by the X server (of
course it triggers an error message).

Okay, it took me quite some hours to figure this out:  It's *not*
a problem with fvwm.  Although you can't see it, the application
window *is* mapped.  It's just that tk thinks it is not visible
and thus does not draw anything into it.  I couldn't find
anything that fvwm is doing wrong.  Actually, I couldn't even
find any difference in the requests that wish sends to fvwm -
regardless if the deiconify line is in the code or not.  I think
there must be a bug in wish.

FvwmBUttons doesn't know about double clicks.  I can't think of a
good way for this.  Sorry.

FvwmButtons already has a similar functionality.  The button is
drawn pressed in instead of shaded, though.  It works like this:

  *FvwmButtons: (Action Exec "xload" xload)

The button stays pressed in until a window with the name xload
appears (the string in double quotes).  The rest of the line is
the command that is executed.

Hi Dominik and thanks for answering.
I can live without the double click feature, but I cannot exactly figure
out what you mean by saying that FvwmButtons stay pressed while the
application is waiting to load.

I have a couple of FvwmButtons bars on my desktop and all the buttons
within them are associated with application icons (background is transparent
so that icons appear to be lined up directly on desktop): for example I
have xterm, gvim, konqueror, opera (and so forth) pixmaps grouped within a
vertical FvwmButtons bar I use to launch the corresponding applications.

I cannot see any change in those icons when I start each application.


Does the FvwmButtons feature you were referring to apply to buttons with
application icons?

Do I need to provide a "pressed down" version of those icons?

Thanks a lot

Sergio
