If we don't want to be backward compatible with the current

And I agree too, even though I have plenty of memory=2E

One could argue that fvwm already have an interpreter built-in! This
interpreter takes up some 200 lines of code=2E A TCL interpreter takes
up 4000 lines (I believe) and can usually be loaded as a shared
library=2E And if you use anything like tkman, tkgoodstuff or similar,
you already have that shared library loaded=2E=2E=2E

There are a difference here=2E I don't what to write a parser in perl
(or whatever language) to parse the configuration file; I want the
configuration file to be written in that language, so the file will be
interpreted directly by the interpreter (or compiler or whatever) of
the language=2E

Thus, if we use perl as the configuration language, the configuration
file should be written in perl!

Can I ask WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?!?!?

The way I see it, the fvwmrc file simply sets a bunch of variables, and
maybe does interpretting for some complex functions, but even then it's
minimal. Otherwise, to get interactive, you use a MODULE... like FvwmTalk,
or FvwmCommand, or whatnot. As far as I can tell, there's an M4 processor,
as well as a C-preprocessor type module, or something like that. If you
want this extra configurability, why not just create a module like
everything else and as the first line of your fvwmrc, immediately use the
module.

The beauty of FVWM is in the modules. Use them.

One might ask, why not include the interpreter directly in the core?
It can actually reduce the fvwm module protocol somewhat!!! With a
full programming language in the core, we can send small pieces of
code to be evaluated by the core=2E Right now we have to communicate a
lot with the core to do anything sensible=2E

The problem, as I see it, that fvwmrc *NOT* just "sets a bunch of
variables", but include lots of other information, like the functions,
menus and module configuration=2E

But, I don't want to get interactive=2E I just want an easier to use

I *COULD* add a new module as outlined by you and others, but I expect
that I would have to extent the fvwm module protocol masively to
accomodate all the query functions=2E And I would still have the timing
holes that are present in the fvwm module protocol (IFAIK)=2E

This is not the best counterargument. For example, Just because I'll visit web 
sites hosted on windows 95 machines doesn't mean I'd ever set up a web server
on such a machine. Since you yourself admit the existense of negative feelings 
against it, I resubmit my argument that we shouldn't use a language on so many 
blacklists. I've already sacrificed guile to the same chopping block. If it
turns out that there is no candidate language which doesn't anger people, then 
I'd say it's not worth the cost of adding one.

It's not that perl's always unsuitable, it's just that it's rarely the most

Good point. I meant a standalone interpreter.

I agree.

1. If we add a full-blown turing complete language to fvwm, I want it to be
   (a) optional (b) in a module (needed for a) and (c) well designed, both on
       our part and the language designers part. 
2. If it's in a module, then we clearly need to redesign the module interface,
   probably by adding a new type of modules. This would either result in
   unportable designs (dynamic loading), or a message passing scheme with 
   lots of mutexes which could well be slow.
3. Right now, the only language a machine need support for a user to run fvwm
   and all of its modules is C. If we add another language, then we have to
   ensure that fvwm remains completely usable for people who
   don't want to run that interpreter on their machine. The nightmare
   situation for me is that fvwm supports 4 languages, and I have to have all
   of them running in order to run the feature set which I want. Not only will 
   this bog down many machines, it makes fvwm depend on a lot of other
   software projects (and language designers are always changing things).

Does anybody who knows slang have anything to contribute? I haven't looked at
it in years, but it's starting to sound to me like a reasonable choice. Is it
lightweight enough to run in the fvwm executable?

This discussion on extension languages is quickly going to descend into
chaos. I see the following desires:

1. A better internal language. I feel that the configuration language used by
   fvwm is both (a) starting to creak and (b) a good basis for something
   better. I imagine that some who want to put a language like tcl into fvwm
   are doing so to enable doing some cool configuration stuff, like generating 
   menus or determining which colors to use, or writing real functions (not
   just event handlers) which can do cool things like loop over the window
   list and move windows around, etc. 

2. The ability to use features inherent in a given language to make deep
   changes to the behavior of fvwm. Perhaps using java to make a portable
   graphical system, or python to be able to write embedded/tightly integrated 
   modules.

3. The ability to write more sophisticated modules in general.

I suspect there is wide agreement with these two points:

1. Fvwm's internal configuration language could be changed for the better.
2. If we add a new language, it should be done as a module. Most likely people 
   would want this module to be as tightly coupled to fvwm as possible for
   speed, using whichever dlopen, mmap, and threading facilities available on
   the various architectures. 

So, my proposal:

Lets table the discussion on tcl/perl/python/java/icon/scheme/... and focus on
improving the internal language and the module interface(s). Both are
necessary before we dive into grafting on an interpreter, and it's quite
possible that if done right, they will obviate the desire for such a grafting.

(I argue that if we add an interpreter, we will have to change the internal
language for two reasons: it's likely we will want to refer to services
provided by modules written in language X in the .fvwm2rc, and we might wish
to unload some of the bloat in the internal language to language X.)

Python I would consider a good second choice. I can understand why rewriting
fvwm in java would not be practical. Python is powerful, supported by many
programmers, and well documented. Pretty straightforward.

Just for the record, the next release of the JDK (1.2) will incorporate the
JFC(aka swing), which is designed for precisely this. I really think a Java
windows manager will be forthcoming after everyone gets their hands on the
swing components (yes, swing can reparent windows). I could easily see this
as a new standard. Remember what sun had hoped for NeWS? But Java is free.

I have great interest in aiding the development of a Java X manager, but
would not want to splinter things even further. I would not start up such a
project for that reason.

Fvwm with python scripting would be a very attractive (and understandable)
combination. That would be very likable and livable.

True the next version of jdk is going to have swing built in but from my
experience in the last few months using swing, it is to buggy and to
unstable to be used for a wm.  This due to the fact that sun doesn't seem
to be activelly fixing bugs in its code, instead it is waiting for the
developers who find the bugs to fix them and submit there fixes.  So
granted swing does make java better it is still to buggy for someone to
rely on for something as important as their desktop.

 There are some things in fvwm2 that cannot be controlled through a
module. For example, if you want to modify how fvwm2 places windows,
you currently have to write/modify C code.

 I am not sure if it is desirable to make fvwm2 larger and more
complex so that people can avoid modifying C code. Supporting all
possible features and modifications just gets one a large muddy
mess, and so at some point it is better to say 'this is what it

 I admit that I don't see any particular need to make the entire
configuration file built around (or parsed through) a language if one
just wants to improve some bits of it (say, the ability to have more
sophisticated functions). I semi-agree that the easiest way to get
more sophisticated functions may be to find a small (and hopefully
elegant) extension language to stick into fvwm2.

 The fvwm2 configuration language is already very optimized for what it
does (which is the natural state of configuration languages). I can't
but think that any replacement that was trying to be a general purpose
language would be worse.

Sirs:
I have FVWM95-2 V2.0.45 ( or whatever) running on my FreeBSD machine. all
the time. I use a fvwmrc that I pulled off a web page somewhere with some
minor modifications and i'm not real sure what I did having not RTFM'd
very much at all so I'll admit I'm comming from some degree of ignorance.
Ok,ok, a Severe degree.  I've just got too many other "priorities".
My point is, You can make fvwm "all things to all people like Win95 but
like 95 "all things to all people" means not doing one thing real well.
You will begin to suffer from creeping featureism.
 On the other hand you have the beauty of a unix based system you can
configure to your heart's content. how about using a language that's
extesible but without a large core of its own. Say, FORTH ?
 On another hand too, I sure would like to see a real serious cometitor to
MS windows. something that would do a real good job. easy for a novice to
showhorn into his computer and begin to get familiar with unix. that's the
advantage MS has now. somebody can get his system up and running fairly
easily and keep it up fairly reliably even with 95 occasional "burps". I
think fvwm could be a very useful tool in that arena. I'm real tired of
the ignorant masses telling me <unix et. al.> is dead but i'm just enough
of a programmer by  FF AA RR   to tackle the task myself.
  All this is a long way of saying I agree with you, Chris.

  Hi,

I'm using fvwm2.0.46, with FvwmAudio, and after a while running, the audio
stops. 

I mean, audio works, just not FvwmAudio. It comes back when I restart
fvwm, but that hardly helps. Any ideas?

			Bye,

Somewhere in fvwmaudio there are two bugs.  (One I can reproduce by
having illegal commands in the .fvwm2rc and 'read'ing the file in, the
other is trickier and seems more random.)

At the moment, my FvwmAudio is compiled with the 'bounds-checking-gcc'
which should make it whine at the usual causes of dying programs, but
now it seems to want to behave and not die.

If you find a way to reproduce the death, drop me a note and I'll see
if I can kill mine and figure anything out.

(And, nope, I haven't figured out how the first crash happens either:
bounds checking gcc isn't detecting the overrun.)

I don't know if it sucks, but it was rather disheartening to spend a couple

I was just wondering if there's a xbuffy out there anywhere (preferably in rpm
format) that's swallowable.  I have numerous boxes to watch and currently
when GoodStuff swallows more than one xbuffy, it spits every occurance of
xbuffy after the first one out onto my desktop.  I'm running fvwm-1.24r-13 and 
xbuffy-3.3-1 and would appreciate any help available.  

Best regards,

-Charlie

I prefer Gnome to KDE, but anyway, the Gnome people want the window
manager to understand additional properties and session management
stuff (should be in the gnome mailing archive), so it might be worth
it to look into this as well.

It's certainly swallowable on 2.0.46.

It would be prudent to wait at least until the Gnome folks have at least
some idea of what WM hints they will want to use.  Right now all that's
gone by is very basic discussion.

I think it comes with fvwm2--have you checked the extras directory? (I
haven't looked there in a while so I may have forgotten).

If it would lead to a cleaner interface, I would have no objection to
making the interpreter part of the fvwm core.

Exactly.  The current configuration language is a hodge-podge of
compromises and kludges.  Fvwm still is the leading, most configurable 
WM around and I don't want to take away from the considerable
achievement fvwm still represents.  
However, I very strongly feel that any new and significant development 
should not be compromised by a misplaced desire to retain compatibility 
with existing config files.  We probably should look at easing the
transition by providing a conversion tool, and that would not require
a compromise.

Anybody wishing to stay with the current fvwm2 can do so anyway.
Fvwm2 is a mature, powerful product and will still be relevant for
quite a few years even if new development ceases.

Absolutely.  There are too many configuration languages as it stands.
Creating a new one would be madness.

So, maybe we should re-focus on which language would be most suitable.

Scheme is already being implemented in the fvwm-derived ``scwm''.
Since we don't want to re-invent any wheels, anybody wanting scheme
should look at contributing to scwm. 

Questions: 

1. What would we want to do with the configuration language?

2. How often would we use it.

3. What kind of language would people find most approachable? 
   (Especially if it's used only occasionally?)

Comments?  Other questions to ask?

Cheers

Depending on what you want, it might be better to brew your own
taskbar using FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan. There are several examples
on the net of this; I can provide excerpts from my .fvwm2rc if you
email me directly.

Why not just socket fvwm ala CORBA, and let anyone use whatever (oo)
language they want?

You could just publish the interfaces (if you do it right, CORBA will
publish the interfaces for you, we just pass out the ORBs).

Finis.

OK, these are good points (I'm leaving the followup gunk at the bottom of my
post for those who don't have threading mailreaders). 

I see three main choices:
1. Keep the current architecture.
2. Add an SOL (some other language) to FIL (fvwm's internal language).
3. Replace FIL with SOL.

I personally would prefer #3. (thanks to Manfred and tonny for pointing out
the costs of my attempt at compromise). But my desire for compromise remains,
since there are many people who use fvwm that don't need a fat interpreter in
the executable. As for #2, I don't like that at all due to the need to
partition functionality between FIL and SOL(s).

The logical reply to that is to use swig, so people can use whichever
interpreter they wish. It probably is a simple matter to implement FIL (or
something like it), as a swigable thing for those who prefer the status quo.
I immediately see two hurdles:

1. Currently modules tell fvwm what to do by sending FIL strings to fvwm. This 
   won't work anymore, since the module writer can't know beforehand which
   language fvwm is going to be using. The solution to this is to probably
   give the modules the swig interface to fvwm as well. 
2. Once we have an interpreter running inside of fvwm, it will probably have
   it's own share of state. It's likely modules will want to
   read/write/execute those (note that this is the modules talking to the
   interpreter, not fvwm as in #1). I don't see any way to prevent modules
   from developing dependencies on the SOL here, but as long as we have a good 
   enough mechanism to support #1, modules should only talk to the SOL when
   then absolutely have to, so that's OK. 

Then there is the problem that I currently have plenty of people sending me
bug reports which include there .fvwm2rc files. It's hard enough getting these 
.fvwm2rc's to work right now. I'll probably go mad if people start sending me
.fvwm2rc's which require me to install tcl version x.y to fix their bug.

So, if we support:
a. FIL only, we frustrate people who want to do things in a real language (if
only I could write a function to do ...)
b. 1 SOL, then we better make sure we don't pick something which many people
   hate. 
c. 2 or more SOL's, then I don't see any way to avoid doing lots of work and
   dealing with logistical headaches.

So, proposing that we choose #b, replacing FIL with one SOL, we're looking at
Manfred's questions:

I see two other questions:

4. How many resources are we willing to use, both in code bloat and requiring
   people to install whichever files language X needs to operate.

5. How nicely does language X lend itself to embedding.

My answers:
1. I want to be able to set the usual fvwm options (a=b type statements),
   maintain state about windows (so I can write functions to do things like
   SmartPlacement), and have real functions. I'd like to have it support a
   module interface, and multiple namespaces (ala python) so that I can
   write modules in that language which won't have namespace collisions with
   each other. Multithreading is probably a reasonably requirement.

2. I would probably do a LOT of programming in such a language, some of it
   released as modules.

3. guile or python

4. Either guile or python could be made to work with a minimal installation of 
   stuff, but the simplest thing for people to do is install the whole damn
   thing. Probably true for any interpreted language.

5. Both guile and python were designed from the beginning to be embedded. It's 
   probably fairly easy to map the window manager data structures onto python
   objects and vice versa. Guile might be more of a stretch.

I have XEmacs 20.4 and fvwm 2.0.46 installed on both a Linux 2.0.30 system with
the Accelerated X 3.1 server, as well as on a Sun Ultra 2, Solaris 5.5.1, and
the (ugh) Solaris openwin X server, because MIT X has no drivers for the
Creator frame buffer.  The .emacs, .xemacs-options, and .fvwm2rc files in both
cases are identical, modulo some pathnames to xpm files and such.

The Linux setup works fine, of course.

On the Ultra, when popping a new XEmacs frame with gnuclient, fvwm switches to
the desk where the FIRST XEmacs frame was mapped, regardless of what the
current desk is or where the other frames are.  This began happening after I
switched from XEmacs 19.15 to 20.4; nothing else was changed.

I can't find anything in any docs, FAQs or the elisp source that gives me a
clue to stopping this highly annoying behavior.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Bryan

Here's what I use in 2.0.46 to swallow multiple xbuffy's:

(2x2 Padding 1 2, Swallow(NoTitle,Close,Kill,Respawn) XBuffy1 "Exec xbuffy -name XBuffy1")
(2x2 Padding 1 2, Swallow(NoTitle,Close,Kill,Respawn) XBuffy2 "Exec xbuffy -name XBuffy2")

The trick is to give each instance a unique name and then swallow 
based on those names, rather on the generic 'XBuffy'.

I'd like to be able to kill windows by combining any of the info FvwmIdent
supplies and any other external info like core size or whatever bites me
tomorrow, with just some lines of any interpreted language, but WITHOUT
writing an own module in C.


1) Fvwm2's internal language cannot do everything.
2) An external language still cannot access fvwm2's internal information.


ad 1)	At least chuck can and should not include a full language into FVWM.
	At least as long as the V in Fvwm stand for "Versatile" and the F
	for "still useable" :-)

ad 2)	I'm talking about window position, window flags, window stacking
	order & the like. 

	Fvwm already has pretty much internal data, but it's less effort 
	and more versatile to let e.g. python access & manipulate the
	window data structure than to reproduce all possibilities of
	python. 


when .fvwmpipe came up, I thought: 
why not just let fvwm read stdin / write stdout in a _really_ _basic_ maybe
just _machine_readable_ language and feed that language interpreter from
any subtle frontend.

hmm, I didn't get to think further ....
at least you can send fvwm some commands via FvwmPipe. It'd be nicer, if
you also got some info from fvwm (e.g: which windows exist, which one has
focus), before you do something to them.

anyway:

Either there's a full language in fvwm2, or a possibility to export fvwm2's
native (!) functions & datastructures (!!) to any unix program.

Anything inbetween is orders of magnitude less useable.

I vote for elaborating on 2) rather than 1)

I agree with #3, but I'm not ready to say that Perl, Python, Scheme, or
Tcl is the language.  I don't see any of them as being 'configuration'
languages.  Sucking in menus by doing:

%RootMenu = (
    'Title'  => 'Toys',
    'Xterms' => (
               'regularterm' => 'xterm',

(etc) would be sort of nifty, but does that really belong in a WM?  (And
I'm beginning to think it's nifty enough that I should play with
FvwmPipe or X11::Fvwm and see if I can hack something like that....)

It seems to me that adding a few hundred k to the size of fvwm for
this is probably not useful in the core, so what functions are missing
from the module interface that inhibit doing this in modules?

Too late. scwm is based on it. I currently have installed one of the first
releases (0.4, I think) and it is impressively usable & stable.
(Then again, they started from fvwm-2.0.46...;-)

The authors did what people here are discussing once again:

- Junked the current "interpreter". According to fvwm-list, this is
  a_good_thing.

- Chose Guile (scheme) as the new supporting language. According to fvwm-list,
  this is _evil_, but only for religious reasons. ;-)

- Since guile isn't a finished product, every scwm'er has a different
  release/snapshot of it installed. Instead of being an obvious a_ha!
  show-stopper, this looks somehow irrelevant (I installed the old 1.2 guile
  release just for it. The developers use modern snapshots. 1.2 simply worked
  for all scwm versions till now).

- They have a quickly developing new wm. Fvwm stopped at 2.0.46. For good, as
  it seems. No hard feelings, Chuck...

  Just one example: the dreaded GSFR is already done. They didn't submit it to 
  this list, allegedly because the C code is too different now for a patch to
  be any use to fvwm...

  Yes, the Great Style Flags Rewrite. Big deal, uh?

As for CPU/memory weight, didn't notice any difference (no stats done, didn't
bother) in a P133/32Mb/Linux.

Personally, I just keep using fvwm2. It does the job and I simply don't have
the time to rewrite the .rc again for another wm (although, using Greg Badros'
config, now written in scheme, looks strikingly similar to the one I picked up 
for fvwm...)

Other reason is that my python "generic" module just keeps working and I
became too sentimentally attached to that code... ;-)

PS: My vote for other wm's:
-(E)nlightenment: colourful, core dumping memory hog (as of 0.13)
-Windowmaker: looks very nice, has session management (sort of), easy but
inflexible config. (by fvwm standards :-). Oh, and YAOCN (yet another original
config. language).
-twm: has session management (xsm)

   Now I don't want to yelled at :)   but how about taking
   the approach of HTML tags?  What you typed up there got
   me thinking, what if we could have tags for each menu and
   menu items?  Like:

   <MENU NAME="Root-Menu">
      <MENUITEM   NAME="Xterm"
                  ACTION="xterm -T $LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME">

      <SUBMENU    NAME="Utils">
         <MENUITEM   NAME="Top" ACTION="rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top">
         <MENUITEM   NAME="Xload" ACTION="xload -fg green -bg black -hl red">
         <MENUITEM   NAME="Calculator" ACTION="xcalc">
      </SUBMENU>
      <!--
       ! and so on ... -->
   </MENU>

   Same with FvwmButtons... you could use the syntax used for
   HTML tables (ie. <TABLE> tag).

   Or does this sound totally stupid? :)


   Sleep on it guys....

(and much other important stuff I snipped, you can refer to his post)

I would say #2 is the best way. You would never find yourself at this crossroads
again. Period.

And CORBA is the standard the whole industry has gone, with the exception of
Microsoft (they want us to use DCOM, and I refuse). Good riddance.  Strong
Middleware makes strong enterprise applications. We could easily get the
published specs and make it truly CORBA compliant. Yikes.

Then let the user decide what language (or any other modules, if any) he wants.

I would think a converter for existing scripts would be pretty acceptable to
current users.

It's simpler (and parsers already exist) to just do this the scheme way:

("Root-Menu"
  ("Xterm "xterm -T $LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME")
  ("Utils"
    ("Top" "rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top")
    ("Xload" "xload -fg green -bg black -hl red")
    ("Calculator" "xcalc")))

Or with python, just replace () with [] and add some commas; perl and tcl are
basically the same.

If you want to have more flexibility, then you can have classes for menu,
submenu, and menuitem, and use constructors (example in python, will work in
any language with objects):

# defined internally in fvwm:

class Menu:
    def __init__ (self, name, menulist=[]):
	self.name=name
	self.menulist=menulist

    def __repr__ (self):
	return "{Menu = <%s, %s>}" % (self.name, self.menulist)

class MenuItem:
    def __init__(self, name, action=""):
	self.name=name
	self.action=action

    def __repr__ (self):
	return "{MenuItem = <%s, %s>}" % (self.name, self.action)

# defined in fvwmrc

M = Menu("Root-Menu", 
	 [ 
	     MenuItem("Xterm", "xterm -T $LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME"),
	     Menu ("Utils", 
		   [ 
		       MenuItem ("Top", "rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top"), 
		       MenuItem ("Xload", "xload -fg green -bg black -hl red"),
		       MenuItem ("Calculator", "xcalc")
		   ])
	 ])

With appropriate cleverness in the __repr__ functions, you could make it print
out the menus in the current fvwm syntax. The nice thing of using a real
language for this, rather than an HTML like syntax, is that it just falls out
that the user can create new types of objects to put in a menu. Probably you
just require than all menu items have to have a certain base class which
contains the member functions to exec the action. If you export some graphical 
functional to the scripting language, then you could even allow the menus and
menuitems to be responsible for drawing themselves. This would make trivial
such things as constructing a menu which automatically finds the the list of
available fonts, and draws each font with the appropriate typeface. 

If the language supports eval() (which I don't believe java does, right?) then 
you can do even more wild things, with modules generating menus dynamically by 
sending the magic strings to fvwm (like a menu for all xterms on the current
desktop).

My configuration of fvwm consists of a number of M4 scripts that
generates menus and toolbars, and setup icons, color schemes and the
like (anybody familiar with TheNextStep should recognize this)=2E There
are a number of problems with this concept, the most serious (for me)
being the fact that the translation of the M4 files into a new =2Efvwmrc
file takes 20-30 seconds on a fast machine=2E Also, any addition of a
new program or anything similar can take some time to configure=2E

If only the m4 preprocessor was faster or my configuration was
interpreted directly by fvwm, then my setup would be very usefull
indeed=2E But, as it is, it's a pain!

So I woul like a configuration language with full access to the file
system, so I can test for various executables and read various
configuration files (e=2Eg=2E color schemes)=2E

I would also like to make an interactive configuration tool for fvwm,
much like the tools seen for Windows95 and other end-user focused
operating systems=2E (No flames please!!!! Much as I dislike the central
concepts of Window95, I must admit that Linux, and for the matter most
other UNIX look-alikes, are hopeless, when it comes to configuration=2E)
Making new menus, adding programs, setting the overall look-n-feel,
setting speaker volume, etc=2E should be easy as pie! All this could be
handled in a module, but then that module should have complete access
to the state of fvwm=2E IFAIK there are some limits on what you can do
through the existing fvwm module interface=2E If one could send
ambitrary scripts to be evaluated by the fvwm core, then we would have
complete freedom to divide functionality between the fvwm core and a
module=2E

If the configuration language of choice has access to X11 in a manner
similar to the TK package (Tcl/tk, perl/tk, =2E=2E=2E), then that would ope=
n
a completely new balliwagon of possibilities!!! Just imagine the type
of interaction one could have in the menus=2E Toolbars would also be a
natual part of the core just like menus=2E etc=2E etc=2E

More or less, all the time=2E Not directly, normally, but through the
different tools=2E

> 3=2E What kind of language would people find most approachable?=20

IMHO the primary goals for a new configuration language are:

- we should *NOT* invent a new language, but an exiting (actively)
supported language (I know that is the title for this thread, but it
can not be said often enough :-))=2E

- the language should have all the modern programming constructs like
lexical variables, conditions, while, for, procedures and
packages/modules/namespaces=2E

- complete access to the file system (test, read and write)=2E

- an easy API for add-on functionality (TCL is a nice example,
whereas in perl it is somewhat harder to add new functionality)

- nice-to-have are closures and threads (though especially the later
can limit the number of platforms, for which the language is avaiable,
I suppose)=2E

- if possible the language should be compiled to byte-code (or
something similar) when read by the interpreter, both for speed and to
perform complete syntax and semantics checks=2E Also if possible, the
byte-code should be savable for fast re-read of the configuration=2E

- the language should havee a basic widget set =DF la tk (as in Tcl/tk)
either in the base language or (better) and an extention=2E

> Comments?  Other questions to ask?

What are the possible candidates??

My current list consists of TCL and perl, both of which are actively
supported by a lot of people=2E

TCL
---

pro's:

- very small kernel
- TCL/tk exists
- well documented in several books

con's:

- only one complex datatype
- no complete syntax and semantics checks at load time
- many people dislike the somewhat peculiar syntax
- no byte-code compiler=2E

Perl
----

pro's:

- multi-threaded
- perl/tk
- complete operating system access
- well documented in several books

con's:

- no byte-code compiler (is this true anymore?)=2E
- complex add-on API

I, for one, would say that we would just replace one obscure
configuration language with another obscure configuration language=2E

How would you create the above on the fly from information found in
the file system?

        Sounds like they've changed the way XEmacs sets window titles for
the various frames, and you have StartsOnDesk specified for XEmacs. Do a
little poking around with FvwmIdent to see what looks different. I still 
have 19.15, so I can't check this out directly.

hi all ..
 
I am using Solaris 2.5.1 with CDE environment. I am planning to move to
FVWM2 Window Manager.
 
I was able to download required source and tried to compile it, but facing
lot of problems.
 
Can anybody point me to pre-built binaries/executable of FVWM for 
Solaris - 2.5.1 ?

I have already checked the mentioned FTP sites, but no luck.
 
Thanks in advance ..

much too cumbersome. I want to be able to read the damn thing (that's why I
can't convince myself to use FvwmM4).
the signal / noise ratio is too low for html code to read.

looks pretty efficient typeing-wise.

ok, so the average user doesn't have to touch this, but exportable classes
do help pretty much, if you want to extend fvwm.

I do think that this on-the fly menu-generation & interpretation isn't an
issue on any decent machine (>=pentium), that's able to run MS word
(isn't that interpreted in winbasic - at least it's as lame)

And I simply wouldn't use that menu on our sparc IPC. :-)

I'd like this pretty much.

I strongly support this route.
I've never met anything more flexible than emacs with its hook functions.

Hmmm.

I just had to use my JBuilder again. I started mucking with the
configuration options in Win95. When you do this you can easily
understand why the public swallowed it whole.

a) Anybody (even a complete novice) can configure their Win95 machine.
Granted it is not as configurable as fvwm2, but it sure is easy.
b) Their menu system consists of a file manager window, referencing an
actual directory that represents the menu system. Simple drag and drop
stuff.
c) There are wysiwygs and gui tools for every thing in the system.
d) The registry is the "database" that contains info about everything,
system wide.

My wife is scared to death of my Intel Solaris at work.  At home, she
thinks linux is a great idea, but is clueless on how to use it. She
liked the fvwm2 when I made it look like a Mac. She was frustrated that
she could not figure out how to modify it.

A couple of years ago, when I installed Win95 for her, the very first
time she sat down she made the system look like a mac. All by herself,
day one. Pretty intuitive stuff. Not that I think the OS should look
like a Mac, but it kinda makes a point.

Just an observation.

Will there be a version 2.10 as promised by the web page? Others have
suggested that Beta version 2.0.46 is the last FVWM version to be
produced.

I agree with the points you have made.  I hope the current group of people who
are pondering an overhaul of FVWM take this into consideration.  Perhaps if Fvwm
could gain a larger crowd it could reap more benefits of a larger crowd (more
development, perhaps money, etc.)  I know most Fvwm users are anti-Microsoft,
but you can't deny MS's success.

a) I too like Win95 because it is very easy to configure.  Yet, if you knwo what
you are doing, you can still alter the look fo it in advanced ways.  I remember
even in Windows 3.1, there was a third party application that would replace the
standard GUI buttons with custom ones you could edit.  Surely this is still
possible.  But the idea of an easily configurable OS is what will make it
popular.  Perhaps even simple plug-in schemes designed by the gurus that people
can tweak.

b) the mnenu system is great.  I tried to mimick this with Fvwm.  I created a
directory tree unfe rmy Fvwm configuration directory called menu.  In their, Is
tarted by making links to the programs or scripts I would execute, or making
simple sccript wwrappers in place.  I had an perl script that was read in
through FvwmPipe that travereded this directory making a menu tree as it went. 
It worked fairly well until I wanted to add custom mini icons, and created a
small etxt foile for each one.  It last its cleanliness then.

c) I've seen people try to do this for unix, but fail miserably.  These are more
than just wrappers to shell commands.

d) The registry is a good idea in some cases, and bad in others.  Primarily.,
thoguh, it is good because everything uses the same config format.  Just a few
simple data types properly arranged and do so much (kinda like DNA.) 
Unfortuneately, it makes it harder to go and rmeove a program by hand, and the
uninstall programs that supposedly do are not up to parf in my opinion.

  bs> I agree with the points you have made.

The problem is that the features you're alluding to often work across
application boundaries and areas of responsibility in UNIX and X
windows.  This, I think, is a Good Thing, but it can make the seems look
more rough.

Things are really starting to come together with the advent of Gnome and
(although I don't like it on philosophical terms) KDE.  Spurred by Linux
development and groups like Debian and RedHat, I think you'll see a big
push towards full GUI configurability for many basic tools very soon.

Heck, RedHat 5 already has many GUI tools for doing standard sysadmin
stuff; I configured my printer, including solving the infamous
"stair-stepping output" problem, with a very easy-to-use little GUI app
and a few mouse clicks.

Someone posted a graphical tool for modifying window manager
configurations, that supported fvwm2.  You couldn't do everything, of
course, but you could do a reasonable amount of stuff.  I haven't used
it and I forget the name, but you might consider that.

Also, you can go look at tkgoodstuff which is an alternative to
FvwmButtons writtine in tcl/tk that is completely GUI-configurable: you
create buttons and popup menus, etc. and move them with drag-n-drop,
etc. etc.  Pretty simple to use, although FvwmButtons is more powerful.

You should go look at wmconfig, created by someone at RedHat.  This tool
reads config files and generates menu output for various window
managers.  The idea is that tools ship with a wmconfig file and install
it when you install them, then the tools automatically appear on your
popup window (if you configure your WM to invoke wmconfig).  It allows
for mini-icons, etc. and is pretty nice--the next version will be even
better :).

Many of the RedHat RPM's come with these config files.

Anyway, I don't think most of this is correctly discussed in the fvwm
mailing lists; the right place to solve them isn't by adding more code
to fvwm, but creating tools which more seemlessly integrate existing
apps--this is a "desktop" concept.  I think you should go look at Gnome
and/or KDE, and see what they're up to.

Python
------
Pros:
- multi-threaded
- tk
- complete operating system access
- tons of supplied classes for things like gdbm
- very active group of users (they've even written a complete web browser),
  with some good books.
- very straightforward to embed and extend
- has always been backward compatable so far
- nice type system (you've always been able to make multidimensional arrays
  :-)) 
- byte code compiler
- supports multiple namespaces (a key pro for me, as you can pass the eval()
  function a dictionary variable to use as the namespace for the evalurated
  string)
- nice type system

cons:
- hasn't been the fastest language, although is is improving, probably as fast 
  as tcl now.
- tk support isn't as good as in tcl, although probably about as good as 
  with perl

Well, this sounds pretty cool to me. I'd wished that I'd heard about it
sooner. I did an altavista search for scwm, but didn't find anything. Ah, just 
found it on the guile webpage.

I'd even go so far to say that I think we should release the current fvwm, and 
make scwm fvwm version 3. Since scwm looks like what a lot of people would
like fvwm to become, and renaming scwm to fvwm3 would give them instant name
recognition and a large user/tester base, it could be a good thing for
everybody. The only issues would be political (which often are the hardest to
overcome).

The Dotfile Generator?  There's also FvwmConf.  The first is in Tcl/Tk,
the second in Perl/Tk.

Well, the discussion here should be 'what is lacking from the module
interface to allow this', I think.  I'm reading over the X11::Fvwm
docs and can't think of anything offhand that would stop .fvwm2rc from
being just:

AddToFunc InitFunction		"I"	Module	FvwmPerlConfig
AddToFunc RestartFunction   "I" Module	FvwmPerlConfig

(or fvwmpython, or whatever....)

The Fvwm-insert-language-here-Config can build the menus, shove in
modules, retrieve a (hopefully cached :)) list of programs that it
wants to add to your menus, etc.

I think the main thing that needs to be done is a demonstration of
that, hopefully done in a portable way so that people can swap configs
of 'Looks' without having to install a ton of software and have menus
that reflect the software installed on their system.

In playing with Fvwm2 and AfterStep, the main things I'd like to see
for Fvwm2 would be 'nameable' Buttons, so that you could define a
button named 'Shade-Me' and have it be tied to Button4 on one config
and then move it to Button3 on another without having to run everything
through M4 or cpp.

Other than that, it's quite cool what you can do with the 'Read' command
and some standard functions like 'CleanUp' that delete all the special
things from a given config.  (I like AfterStep's "Look" and "Feel"
sets of menus and wanted to do something similar, but have it be more
complete: including moving buttons around, not just changing their
appearance.)

Oh, yeah, and maybe allow 'DestroyStyle *' to nuke all the styles. :)

It wasn't a StartsOnDesk problem, however it did have to do with the window
title.  Thanks to vroonhof@math.ethz.ch for the following patch, which made
the problem go away (for me):

File an official bug report if you haven't already done so and apply
this patch (this changed between 20.3 and 20.4). Note that the comment 
still applies, be carefull with the the modeline spec.

There was a big discussion about this on fvwm-workers a while back;
unfortunately I doubt that this will ever happen.  I gave the same argument
about inheriting the FVWM user base that you did, but it didn't fly.

I  don't see how  you have   answered  #4 above.   Wouldn't having  an
interpreter hooked up  to fvwm2   consume  lots of  memory   instantly
transforming fvwm2 into CDE?

Wouldn't any  new "fvwm plus interpreter"  project be redundant to the
scwm  project?  (It  doesn't  seem  to me  that  it  makes much  of  a
difference whether the interpreter is Scheme, Perl, Tcl, Java.)

I haven't  come to any final  opinion, I'd like to  see how scwm works
out, but so far I'm not having many problems I can't solve with fvwm2.

I'll probably get a lot of flame mail for proposing this in light of of the 
recent dialog going on about a new language specification for FVWM.  I am of 
the opinion that the simple solution is usually the best.  I started using FVWM
because from a look and feel perspective it had the most synergy with OLVWM
(Openlook Virtual Window Manager) and was much better than the CDE that Sun
Microsystems ships with their OS.  The only problem I had with FVWM was the,
somewhat, cryptic specifcation for setting up your windows and mouse/key
bindings, etc.  For me the syntatic specification for things that were simple 
one-liners in OLVWM were somewhat ugly in FVWM.  Since OLVWM is in public
domain and has a well defined parser.  I would think you could start with that 
and extend it for the other things that are in FVWM that are not supported in 
OLVWM.  OLVWM supports a hierarchical menu structure that can be specified in
one file or split up into different files that can be referenced by one top 
level menu file.   See following example from when I used to use OLVWM.

	I just recently started using fvwm and then fvwm2.  They both have 
worked out just fine, except their poor display of any GUI application.  
What I mean in particular regarding the poor display, is a thick black 
line drawn around every box or button within the GUI window (NOT on the 
border or title bars).  I realize this must be a configuration problem 
with fvwm on my part (it doesn't do it with olwm), but I have been 
unable to figure it out which one.  

	Two questions:

	1.  How can I get rid of the thick black borders?

	2.  Is there a better, more thorough list and explanation of the 
configurable items than the manpage provides?


I would appreciate any help.

Thanks,


amh

| This could be a good idear, but I don't see the advantages over a new
| "good and clean" configuration language.

 Here is where we differ, because I feel that fvwm2's configuration
language is already highly optimized for its intended purpose and quite
good at being very expressive in a compact way. The only thing I think
is lacking is sophisticated functions, and one can get those without
throwing out the baby with the bathwater (and they need more than a
configuration language change anyways).

 If there are things that cannot currently be done in fvwm2's
configuration language, that's one thing. But to make the syntax more
complex and verbose and picky for no gain except it now being in some
general programming language seems to me to be a very perverse and
backwards thing to do.

Probably about a meg. Certainly significant. There will be some memory

I didn't know about the scwm project until recently. I agree that it seems
quite redundant, so much so that I suggested in my last post that perhaps it
would be best for everyone if scwm became fvwm version 3. 

I personally have lots of problems with FvwmIconMan, and other modules which I 
would like to write, that would be solved by having an interpreter in fvwm.

What! Has tcl improved so much recently? I have to give 8.0 a try...
;-)

More seriously:
I'd add
cons: the interpreter bloats fvwm considerably.

This applies to all other proposed interpreters. Tcl seems the least bad.
But there _are_ some lean implementations for some languages, such as Forth
(several), Scheme (Elk?), Slang?

It does not have to be _best_ language, just a good enough compromise between
features and size...

I couldn't really find another post I wanted to respond to, and didn't
feel like spawning a new thread, so here's my 2c on the current
situation.

1) FVWM is a pain to configure. So is any other X11 window manager.
Personally, I feel that the least offensive (besides the obvious choices
like wm2 and wmx) is actually TWM. The 'Decor' idea in FVWM is bloated
and very difficult to work properly with, IMHO. TWM offers more
per-window capability. However, since the trend seems to be swinging
toward an interpreted language, this TWM-style config file is out of the
question (unless someone feels a pressing need to work on it).

2) My vote for an interpreter would be Scheme. Tcl/Tk seems to have a
lot of problems with different versions. Python might be a good choice,
but since I have no experience, I would have to abstain. Please, let's
not munge Perl into the mix - I have nothing against Perl - but let's
leave Perl to do what it was designed to do. Another advantage to Scheme
(Guile, IMHO :) would be the ability to eliminate Decors (can anybody
tell I have a grunge match against Decors?)

(title-style-set! "Emacs" '(hgradient ...as before, offering TWM
per-window syntax while retaining the power of FVWM.

FVWM is probably in need of an overhaul - there's a couple places in the
code that could definately use cleaning up. I vote we make a big push
toward a 'final' version (2.1 or whatever) and then start looking at
scwm.

There was a slight change in that respect-- XEmacs no longer has the ':' in
the window title. I start an XEmacs process at start-up (I run it as a server),
and had a Wait that needed tuning once I upgraded.

Andy,

	If I follow what you're saying, you're seeing black borders around individual
GUI components, such as text boxes, or push buttons, within the application. 
The window manager shouldn't be affecting this at all.  This should be a
function of whatever GUI library that particular application is using, such as
Motif, for example.

	The only things I can figure that would be different between your use of olwm
and fvwm* are:

1. You are running with different GUI library (a different Motif library?)
2. You are on a different computer which then entails 1.
3. Your X resources in your .Xdefaults have changed.

	Whatever the case, modifying your X resources for the apartiuclar GUI
library(ies) you are using could eliminate the problem.

Brian.

Or perhaps:

  4. You are using more colors in fvwm2 borders,  icons, etc.  Causing
your app  to paint its  boxes, buttons, etc,  with a  different set of
colors.  If you   are on a color   limited display, avoid  full  color
icons, gradient decorations, and the like.

	It turns out that *borderwidth was being set from .Xresources, but 
wasn't being set in .Xdefaults.  Apparently I don't have olwm set up to 
use .Xresources, so while it was working, fvwm and fvwm2 were picking up 
the *borderwidth from .Xresources.

	Thanks for the help, those borders were driving me crazy.

 What's the point? Seriously: what's the point to just making menu

The example is very fine, but doesn't solve any of the problems some

well more time has passed, and I might switch to scwm too. Maybe others
will follow.

This looks familiar to the minix discussion list, where they asked 
"where've all the people who supplied patches gone to"

They'd gone Linux'.

If we all wait for the conversion tools to be written, we might wait a long
time.

I've rewritten my .fvwmrc several times so far. (1.24-> 2.0 -> extensions)
before that I had a .mwmrc, .twmrc & others.

I think I'll add a .scwmrc as soon as possible.

minus FvwmAuto which is much too much for a simple raise from a focus_change hook.
same for FvwmAudio/FvwmEvent which supplies the event hook functionality,
that fvwm2 is misssing.

And I think "my" modules FvwmAudio->FvwmEvent and FvwmAuto are simply
one-liners in lisp.

FvwmAuto in elisp: 
(add-hook fvwm-enter-window-hook (progn	(sleep-for 0 300)
					(raise)))

I'm using Fvwm 2.0.46 on my Digital Unix system (a preliminary release
of Digital Unix 5.0).

In my .fvwm2rc file, I have the following Mouse lines:

	Mouse	1	T	N	Move-or-Maximize
	Mouse	1	FS	N	Resize-or-Raise


The functions called are described below:

	DestroyFunc	 "Move-or-Maximize"
	AddToFunc	 "Move-or-Maximize"
	+ "I"	Raise
	+ "I"	Focus
	+ "M"	Move
	+ "D"	MaximizeVert

	DestroyFunc	 "Resize-or-Raise"
	AddToFunc	 "Resize-or-Raise" \
	  "I"	Raise
	+ "I"	Focus
	+ "M"	Resize

My understanding is that this should allow me to do the following:

1.  Mouse button 1 on the title bar will always raise and focus the
    window, and if the mouse moves, the window will be moved.  On the
    other hand, if it is a double click, the "MaximizeVert" function
    will be called (which maximizes only in the vertical direction;
    function is not included here).

2.  Mouse button 1 on a frame (the corners) or a side (the frame above
    the title bar and below the window) will raise and focus the
    window, and if the mouse moves, it will allow me to resize the
    window.

The problem occurs when I click on the title bar on a window that isn't
currently focused.  Instead of getting running "Move-or-Maximize", fvwm
runs the "Resize-or-Raise" function.  This doesn't happen if the window
already has the focus.

I can prevent the calling of the "Resize-or-Raise" function by removing
the "S" from the "FS" in the second Mouse line, but that prevents me
from being able to resize vertically or horizontally (I can only resize
diagonally).

My current workaround is that if I wish to move a window without the
focus, I will click on the window (to give it the focus), release the
mouse pointer, and immediately press it again.  Fvwm then runs the
Move-or-Maximize function, which is what I want.  It's an extra click,
though.  And I STILL occasionally get caught with a window that resizes
when I really want to move it.

Is there a bug in fvwm's logic that makes it think a title bar on a
window without the focus is instead a window "side?"  If this has been
reported before (I may have missed it on this mailing list, although I
have been reading it for a couple of years), is there a plan to fix it
in the (hopefully) upcoming 2.0.47?

Many people will tell you :

(found in a siganture)

Many people don't like the parentheses, but also many people use emacs and
happily use / program elisp.

well not that big, but nobody touched it, because we were waiting for chuck

hmm, don't have time now to fiddle, but I'll look into it.

I can't add much to Brady's statement, without testing the product.
I do like the versatility of emacs-lisp, so I sure would jump on a
multithreaded lisp-extensible WM.


o) external access to data

	In a prior posting, I also pointed out that a complete language is
	still not enough. One still might want to throw in some external
	programs, so all internal structures should be accessible from
	outside. 

	You can do that with a lisp-wrapper, as the various lisp-modes in
	emacs show (command, compilation, man-mode, shell-mode, and so on).

o) I still would like the interpreter to be optional / transient /
   permanent / split / in a shared library.

	For most people it's enough to set variables. So they only need
	either
		a config data dump to be read in at startup  or
		a transient interpreter, which terminates after setup

	If you use lisp functions or hooks you can still benefit from
	a split ascii-to-bytecode translator & bytecode interpreter.

		All the junky tokens & syntax tables are in the translator
		and are therefore dumped after reading and parsing the
		config info.

		This also speeds things up considerably, since only
		bytecode is executed.

	Only in the case that an external program outputs ascii lisp
	commands to be executed by fvwm or eval() is used, this has to be
	fed through the translator. 

   So the ideal layout would be core fvwm with an option (or command) to
   speedload a variable image, and for complex commands a split bytecode
   interpreter and ascii-to-bytecode translator.

   The bytecode interpreter has to be some sort of library. Getting/putting
   common functions from/into a dynamically loaded shared library would be
   great. It will usually be swapped out / unloaded after not being
   accessed for a while. 

   The translator (Tokenizer / syntax checker) can be either shared library
   or external. Both ways it will be dumped, when it's not used for a while.

Hi,

I am using fvwm2 with XFree86 and LINUX. I enabled ClickToFocus
on all windows. However when I click on a window with a modifier key
activated (often Num lock) it does not receive focus. How can
I change the behaviour of ClickToFocus to ignore modifier keys?

Thanks,

Felix

Hmm, I think there might be something else wrong here but I can't tell 
you exactly what.  Check your ``Xmodmap'' for key mappings.

I experienced a similar problem once when I used an incorrect mouse
protocol.  See ``/etc/X11/XF86Config''.

Anyway, on my system I have the mouse buttons configured like this:

## MouseButton: 0=any, 1, 2 or 3
## \      Context: R=RootWdw,  W=AppsWdw, T=TitleBar, S=Sides
##  \    /         F=Frame (corners), I=IconWdw, 0..9=WdwButtons
##   \  |              Wdw Button order: 1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2
##    | |      Modifiers: None,Control,Shift,Meta,Any,3=super,4=hyper
##    | |      \        Function
## ---+-+-------+-------+-----------
Mouse 1	R   	A       Menu Main Nop
Mouse 2	R    	A      	Menu Module-Popup
Mouse 3	R    	A      	WindowList

Mouse 0	1    	A      	Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse 0	3    	A     	Delete
Mouse 0	8    	A     	Stick
Mouse 0	6    	A     	Iconify
Mouse 0	4    	A     	Maximize-Func
Mouse 0	2    	A     	Delete
Mouse 0	W	4	Menu Window-Ops2 Nop

Mouse 1	F	A	Resize-or-Raise

Mouse 1	I	A	Move-or-Iconify

Hi,

I am using fvwm2 with LINUX and XFree86.
I put the following in my .fvwm2rc:

  DeskTopSize     3x3
  EdgeScroll      25 25

However sometimes if I move the mouse to the border of the screen
scrolling does *not* work. I experienced the same problem on both
a SUSE machine and a RedHat 5.0 machine. Does anyone know how to
avoid this problem?

Thanks,

Felix

  The only time I've experienced this is when a Netscape
Navigator/Communicator window is exactly at the edge (could be all motif
apps, haven't checked and can't do that right now..). This is the same
for all platforms I've tested (Linux XF86, Solaris 2.5.1, Solaris 2.6,
AIX4.2, AIX4.3) with Fvwm2.0.40 - 2.0.26 ..
  The remedy I've found is to move the window 5 pixels or so away from
the edge.. See if that helps you too..

Will there ever be a 2.1.0, or has the coding of the main window manager 
pretty much died?  I've seen the 2.1.0 date at 'Real Soon Now' for over a 
year.  FVWM is loosing people to enlightenment, afterstep, etc. and I think 
a new release might help matters.

Nils.

X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

I have written a patch for FvwmTaskBar which allows the following behavior:
  - Only windows on the current desk (including sticky windows)
    show up in the taskbar
  - When the desktop is switched, the taskbar updates to show only windows which
    are associated with the new desk

This allows the taskbar to be much less crowded, and I find this behavior to be
more useful than having taskbar entries for every window known to FVWM.

If there is any interest in this patch, I'd be happy to make the above behavior
optional and then submit the patch to the public domain.  I have two questions:

1) Is there any interest?
2) Who would be the appropriate person to send such a submission to?  I checked
   the source code, but none of the email addresses listed there exist anymore.
   I also checked the FAQ, which said that the mailing lists were the current
   forum for new code submissions.

Thanks for any info,

p.s. - I'm not subscribed to the mailing lists, but I check the archive regularly,

Small question...

What is the trick with the .fvwmrc file? I have placed a copy in my
/home/username dir and it still uses the
default system.fvwmrc!

This is a new install of RedHat 5.0 (Hurricane).

With the version that shipped with 4.1 this worked great allowing each user
to have a custom FVWM.

Is this a feature or <G> a bug?

Any help appreciated...

Rick Munday

Feature.  Call the file .fvwm2rc and it should be read.  The idea was
to allow people to use fvwm and fvwm2 without confusion.

Assuming you are running fvwm2, name the file .fvwm2rc.

See also the script utils/fvwm_convert which can convert a .fvwmrc to
.fvwm2rc.  Some tweaking may be required.

You should include a reference to the rc file when invoking Fvwm.
This means that you should strart Fvwm by a command like:
fvwm2 -f /home/foobar/.fvwm2rc

Hope this helps,

To taskbar or not depends in part on your previous experience. I use three entities
instead:
1. A horizontal (bottom) buttonbar with my frequently used programs.
2. A vertical (lower left) buttonbar with raise, lower resize etc. functions. This
forms a "lazy L" configuration with the other button bar.
3. an FVWMPager (upper right) with four desktops, each with four pages.

Thie pager is really my task bar. The tasks are shown as tiny windows on the desktop
and page where I started them. To switch to that task I just click on the little page
image.
If a particular page gets busy I can move a window to another page or desktop by
using the middle mouse button and dragging it on the pager. This is also a useful way
to center a window on a page.

The three entities described above are sticky on all pages.

There are two advantages to my setup as I see it. The bottom bar remains static. I
know what is on it and where it is indicated. The tasks themselves are never
iconified once started. They just reside on different pages. To move to that task I
move to that page.

I have similiar thing, but i also use FvwmIconMan. I have a two column
buttonbar, with a 3x4 pager swallowed at the two, then working down,
asclock and xload, netscape and xterm, followed by raise and lower,
resize and move, iconify and kill, all 1/3 the height of a normal
icon. Below that i've got a tiny xterm swallowed (I was forever
opening an xterm just to run some xapp, so i thought i'd have a tiny
one there instead). Finally xpostit and lock,restart,exit. This is
sticky, in the topleft. Botton right i have an iconmanager growing
upwards. I tend to prefer having any static 'clutter' on the left hand
of the screen, letting things (long xterms and especially xdvi) run
off the bottom and off to the right.

Why am i telling everybody this? well, i think its interesting to see
how people set their desktops out. I've seen a couple of pages with a
number of .fvwmrcs but most of them seem to be abit out of date.
Certainly they arent in the numbers that you see in other
windowmanagers (perhaps this is a good thing).

Also, i feel that users actually talking about how they use fvwm is a
good thing. User-pull and all that.

ps: .fvwm2rc available if anybody is interested

To fvwm experts,

I am not sure here is apropreciate for such fundamental questions or not.
But as a new user of fvwm, I do need help over displaying pixmap icons on 
fvwm-2.46.   

I just compiled fvwm-2.46 with the xpm-3.4k library over solaris 2.5
platform. The compilation is successful. I suppose I should get color
pixmap icon over my destop while all the other things look ok. However,
the newly compiled fvwm just can not properly display color pixmap icons.
I am wondering any of you getting this problem before and solved it
already can help me.  

Regards,

Tzung-Yin

Interesting setup.  I've got mine set up much to my liking also..

I don't like to use the mouse, so I've got plenty of keyboard shortcuts,
including a pop-up "start menu" and lots of other things which work
without the mouse.  The most noticable thing, though, is the different
visual themes...

I've set up a dual-headed box (Linux, Accelerated-X 4.1MX) running
fvwm-2.0.46. It works perfectly, fvwm takes over both displays when
started.

However, all clients that are started by .xinitrc or InitFunction
pop up on display :0.1. Is there a way to get these to open on the
second display, apart from specifying the display as a parameter to the
client?

I believe I've read something related to this a while back, but I
couldn't find it in the archives.

Petter Adsen

The gnome people are inviting anyone interested in
window managers to subscribe to their list (gnome-list@gnome.org)
and give input -- currently, the icewm author has some proposals
for hints that most people seem to agree are needed.  The gnome
people also say that x session management is a necessary addition
and someone has offered to help window manager authors implement
it.  I think it's necessary that this gets added -- icewm is the
only wm so far that is working on x session management.

I don't know about everybody else, but I think a far more useful property
of a task bar would be one that only included iconized applications.  If
they aren't iconized, they are easy to find.

Actually, I for one do like to include all of my windows.  That way, if one
window is mostly or completely obscured by another, I can still get to it
without rearranging the positions of my windows.

That's a good idea.  Here's what I'll do -- I'll add an option
like *FvwmTaskBarShowWindows which can be set to "All", "CurrentDesk",
or "Iconized".  "All" will be just like the current FvwmTaskBar module,
"CurrentDesk" will show only windows for the current desktop, and
"Iconized" will show only iconized windows.

When I'm done, I'll post the resulting module to this group.  Thanks for
the input.

Could you make two options for it so it will have a 2x2 effect?

CurrentDesk - Shows only windows from current desk, otherwise all desks.
Iconized - Shows iconized windows as well as non-iconized windows, otherwise
just non-iconized windows.

This way, someone could pick and choose whether they wanted iconized/non and
current/all windows displayed.

Brian.

Wow. I do not know the answer, but I would like to know how you set this up
in the first place.

Can you use two(2) adapters? I have a pair of Matrox Millenium IIs, one 8
Megabyte, the other 2 Megabyte, with an extra 17"(it was from my previous
setup). Also, can the monitors use different refresh rates? The 17 does not
do a v refresh as high as the 21.

I  would love to use my 2nd monitor for palletes and toolbars (visaj, adobe
illustrator, corel draw), then use my 21 for the program or canvas,
depending on what I am doing.

The pager would be awesome in this config!

Any ideas?

PS. Of course right now I cannot even access the internet from linux, after
i put in an ISDN modem. I read the isdn4linux faq and got pretty scared, so
am using the win95 mail  ;-(

If people are hacking on the taskbar/iconbar stuff, I'll resend my
fervent wish for the "perfect taskbar feature"... and I don't even think
it should be that hard, at least not the basic idea... but I'm not an X

Subject: Fvwm Icon Manager enhancement
Date: Wed Jul 23 11:56:00 -0400 1997

OK, I've been playing with various icon managers, from fvwm2's builtin
iconbox and windowlist, to FvwmIconMan, to the task bar that fvwm95
uses, to tkgoodstuff's windowlist tool.

All of them are cool, but none do quite what I want.  I think what I
want would be most excellent (just saw Bill & Ted's again on Fox last
week :) so I'm asking if anyone can point me to something that can do
it, or is interested in modifying their particular manager to do it.

First, I have _tons_ of icons.  Most of them are of two basic types:
Emacs frames and rxvt windows.  There are some others thrown in for good
measure (ical, tkman, maybe a WWW browser, occasionally Frame, etc.)

The rxvt windows are also of a few discrete flavors: for example, we use
ClearCase at work and I have a specific ClearCase class of rxvt windows
that are set to ClearCase views.

I have so many icons they can't all be shown at once.  And I really hate
scrollbars in an icon manager; too cumbersome.

Here's what I'd like:

  * An interface like the 95 button bar where you get a button per task,
    then you click on it to raise/focus it, etc.

  * BUT!  It should be possible to define a _set_ of windows that would
    appear under one button.  Then I'd define one set for Emacs frames,
    one for ClearCase view rxvt's, etc.  And I'd get just one button no
    matter how many Emacs frames I had.  The set would be based on X
    resource class/instance names, of course.

    When you picked a button that represented multiple windows, you'd
    get a popup listing each of the windows with its title (like the
    fvwm2 builtin windowlist).  Then you'd pick the one you wanted from
    that list.

  * The button bar should have an option for hiding itself, like win95
    and the new tkgoodstuff can, where it becomes a thin line against
    the edge of the screeen when the mouse moves off of it, then
    reappears when you move back over it.

  * In an ideal world, you could also define actions for each set; the
    actions would appear on the popup above the list of windows,
    separated by a line.  The actions could of course be commands, fvwm
    modules, or whatever.

    Right now I have an FvwmForm configured to start ClearCase views; it
    asks for a view name and invokes rxvt with a command to set to that
    view.

    So, for my rxvt ClearCase "set", I'd want my popup menu to be
    something like:

        .________________________.
        | New View               |
        `------------------------'
        ' psmith_view1 @ lemming `
        | psmith_view2 @ bronto  |
        | psmith_view3 @ whaler  |
        `------------------------'

    Then when "new view" was picked, my FvwmForm module is kicked off.

Anyway, you get the idea.

I _dream_ about this interface now that I've imagined it.  Can someone
help? :)

I'm on Linux, with, I believe, Fvwm2 2.0.45/46, and I can't get the most
basic UNIX networking applet to run:

I start X, start an xterm inside Fvwm2 and then execute manualy:

rsh -l maxwell toronto "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -display maxwax:0.0"

When run on system 'maxwax' It should: 
  execute rsh,
    rsh connects to toronto as user maxwell
    run /usr/bin/X1/xterm on toronto
    display a new xterm window on system maxwax's display.

This works fine, but when I attempt to place the same command within my
.fvwm2rc file, it hangs when I execute it.

Switching to another virtual console and performing a 'ps' shows two rsh
processes sitting there.  Killing them doesn't do anything, I have to kill
X or ALT-backspace to shut X down and restart.

What am I missing here?  I'm performing the same function on my SCO OS504
system at work with it's rcmd instead of 'rsh'--basically the same
thing--without any problems.

ANY suggestions greatly appreciated!

That does seem odd. I don't know why you could execute it successfully 
from command line but not in your .fvwm2rc file. When it freezes your
display, I don't think killing the rsh process will help. You may have 
to go to the machine 'toronto' and kill the 'xterm' process you
started there. 

What I don't understand is, why are you running xterm
on a remote system and displaying it to your local display? It would be
much simpler and faster to do something like:
	xterm -e "ssh -l maxwell toronto" in your .fvwm2rc file.
Unless you don't have xterm installed on your local LINUX system, I
really don't see the advantage in running one remotely. This is not a
solution to your problem, just an alternative. And I think 'ssh' is much
better to use in you case since it uses the secure X channel and sets 
your display automatically for you, and 'rsh' is actually something that
should not be used any more.

FvwmIconMan can have multiple instances to manage sets of windows as
you request.  Check out this list's archives for examples of
combinations of FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMans to construct a task bar.

  * FvwmTaskBar can hide itself but does not have the functionality of
    the multiple FvwmIconMans AFAIK.

  * FvwmAuto, but this currently acts on all windows.  It cannot be
    targeted at the task bar alone.

I got a problem with FvwmPipe, when I run it, the module seems to
work well, but when I send things in the pipe using :
echo "Refresh" > .fvwmpipe.in   (for example)
it enters an infinite loop, then it takes 90.0% of CPU .. :(((
Anybody got a clean patch ? I made one, but it's really dirty ..

Another problem with FvwmPipe is that when I leave Fvwm2, the process
is still alive, and a KillModule doesn't work anymore ..

an idea ?

Well I can see the benifit in running it that way.  For example I work on
a sparc 2 and it takes a good 15 seconds to pop up a xterm on my machine,
but only takes 2 seconds to get the xterm up and give me a shell prompt on
one of the ultras in my subnet.

Now to answer your Maxwell's question the problem is that your quotes are
getting stripped off well before they are supposed to be.  The solution I
came up with is to use xrsh.  Which is a script that I picked up somewhere
along the way and that used to be distributed with X11R3 and R4.  The way
you use it is simple

xrsh machine 
or xrsh machine xcpustate 
or xrsh -l <username> machine <any xapp and args>
the only problem with it is you need to have a .rhosts file on the
destination machine because the script pipes all output to /dev/null

so in fvwm I have
Exec xrsh <machine>

so I'll attach the script and you can use it as you like.

Ok, that's another thing I have to do: I did check to see that Fvwm2 is
running rsh on the local linux machine, and I'm assuming it's attempting
to connect to 'toronto' and do its job, but it's their just sitting there.
Now I'll telnet to toronto and see if there is any activity.

I'm assuming the "hang" I see is Fvwm waiting for my command (rsh) to go
off, and start itself correctly before Fvwm returns to regular window
processing.  It seems to run rsh, but sit there waiting for something and
the only thing I can do is move my mouse around.. Can't select windows,
can't kill anything with the mouse, etc.

Well, this is my home network, only connected to the outside world via a
rare PPP connection.  As such, security isn't much of a concern, but were
I to be doing this on the internet or a more populated network, yes, ssh,
would be a great idea.  Thanks for the suggestion.

I'm trying to use rsh to start an xterm on the remote system so that as
much of the resource (memory/cpu) usage is on the remote, and only the
display is on my local system.  Essentially, I do a lot of work on the SCO
system and I want to use my Linux system as an Xterminal.  I figured rsh
to start an xterm was just as good as any way..

Actually, I believe the hang is that rsh doesn't supress the std file
handles properly and ends up sleeping on the socket reading nothing.
Try redirecting stdin/out/err from/to /dev/null.

I'd cut and paste it, but I switched to ssh long ago and haven't looked
back.  (Compression over a pokey modem is wonderful... it even
compresses Xprotocol pretty well.)

I run ssh from home, partly for security, partly for ease of use.

Yep ('cept for rsh's security and a bad mix with X's security), though
you do have to ensure the file handles are all closed or rsh will sleep
forever.

Gentlemen,
This may seem a trivial question, but I would really appreciate it if
you could find the time to reply. When I set the background to a
particular .xpm it shows up fine. However, when I select save desktop as
new.xinitrc the new.xinitrc fails to have any command for that pixmap
written in it. If I leave X and come back the background is just set to
an off blue. The man page for xsetroot only refers to .bmp files and
they don't seem to work with fvwm. I've looked all around for the
correct command to set an .xpm file but I have not been able to find it.
Also I would have thought that the save desktop as new.xinitrc would
have written it in there. Lastly I'm using the Redhat 5.0 release and I
was unable to find the fvwm.man file so I'd like to know where I can get
that.
I really appreciate your help.

Could you perhaps send me some information on the use of fvwm2 and a
default config file with the
icons and all needed.  I am having a hell of a time trying to configure
it.  Thanks

FvwmCommand 1.5 is released.

FvwmCommand lets you monitor fvwm2 transaction  and  issue
fvwm2 command from a shell.

It can be found at:
  www.concentric.net/~Isogai/fvwm2/fvwm2.shtml

Changes on ver. 1.5 is :
  Fixed bugs in reading and writing FIFOs.

  Will not exit after bad messages.

  Server keeps track of connection to client to avoid sending
  unnecessary messages.

  Handle multiple (long) commands correctly.

  Added lock mechanism to avoid connecting multiple FvwmCommand
  to a FIFO. 

  Added focus-link.pl script and its manpage.


The last item, focus-link, needs some explanation.  It is a user
programmable window focus script. Here is its default behavior.

       1.     When a window is opened up, focus  the  window  and
              move  the  pointer to it. The parent window regains
              focus when  a  window  is  closed.   Parenthood  is
              determined  when a window is opened. It is the last
              focused window with the same X class.

       2.     #1 would not occur to AcroRead opening window.

       3.     #1 would not occur when SkipMapping is set and  the
              window is the only window of its class.

       4.     For  Netscape  find  dialog window, addition to #1,
              resize the window to 300x150 pixels and move it  to
              East  edge  of the screen.  Download/upload windows
              will not be focused nor be in focus link list.

       5.     Move appletviewer to NorthWest corner.

       6.     Xterm won't focus back to its parent after  closed.

       7.     When  a  window  is de-iconified, focus it and move
              the pointer.

If all you want is to achive #1, all you need in user_function  is :

sub user_function {     
  if (action_was ("add")) {
    focus_window();
    warp_to_window (50, 50); # center of the window
  }elsif (action_was("destroy")) {
    focus_window (get_parent_window());
  }
}
  
To add #3, add following before "focus-window" in "add" block.

  if (window_flag('SkipMapping') && no_parent_window()) {
      return();
  }



The house keeping in this script is done in other functions and 
the configurable section is faily easy and short. 



Enjoy.

The method I use for xpm's is 
xpmroot it comes with fv
inyour init function add 
+ "I" Exec xpmroot <filename>


or for other image types
+ "I" Exec xv -root -quit <filename>

with xv there are various switches that go with -root that do things like
tile or maximize or mirror or ...

hope that helps,
Brad 

P.S.
as for the man page try 
man fvwm2
or 
rpm -ql fvwm2  and you should see the path to the man page in there

I've seen rsh's hanging, waiting for 'unnecessary' filedescriptors
which were inherited from their parent process!
So if the shell closes all descriptors before starting rsh but fvwm
somehow doesnt, *then* you might be in a fix. I once wrote a little Program
called 'claoseall' (used like nice and such) which closes all except the
first three descriptors, then execs the rest of the command line.

Sometimes though it's enough to run 'rsh without input' (with option '-n')
like 'rsh -n -l user host command'

This is *really* strange! I only have the idea to look for fvwm
being blocked by waiting for something which never happens :-)
Did you try to kill 'fvwm itself' (or does your session end then, so you
can't do that easily).

Somebody else advised to use 'ssh' !  I strongly soc[uo]nd that notion!
(OOPS, my vocabulary is slowly leaking... was that correct? )

'ssh' is a lot more secure and simpler anyway. Use it with '-n'
too in case you 'only start an xterm'.

	Well, maybe you remember me, I am that nice guy who wrote the
nextify patch for the marvellous fvwm2, I'm being out of it for a while,
(mainly becasuse I finished my studies (physics) and started new ones
(mathematics) so, sorry for the wait, but I'm on it again, and having
seeing the problems fvwm2 is having to keep up to the new standards,
and because I like it to much to just forget it, I started (today, hehe, 
I code really fast :) a big change to several things in fvwm2 I think
can be improved (mainly menu and decors), so the good news are that it 
was easier that I thought it to be, the bad news are that I indented the
whole code (sorry but I like it kr style :), so the patch is really
great, I'v decided to pack the whole code, but I have no web server
or ftp server to put it on.

	I hope to finished the code before June (it's almost done, but
I want to be sure it works in the rage conditions), so if any of you have
some spare space in his big and incredible ftp server please drop me a
mail (preferebly if you have a good conection to the net, no 28.8kbps
please :)

	The look of my fvwm2 is really good now (I would say the best
wm I've ever seen) and it is not too difficult to configure, so....

PS: don't ask for screenshots, I will post some as soon as I could :)

OK, I got the latest RPM of fvwm2, got it running, etc.  Love it, *especially* 
with XFCE.

My ques is, where do I cop some documentation from?  All that's in my 
/usr/doc/fvwm2* directory is a README which pointed me at the homepage, a FAQ 
which answered a *couple* of my questions, a to-do, and a changelog.  I wanna 
learn how to make it look like I *want* it to look, button styles, etc.  Where 
do I find this info?  Whoever put the rpm together left out the man pages!!!!!

	I would send it to Adam (through gzip or bzip2) and some screen
shots this week (I'm having some problems with per-menu-fonts approach)
The main goal of the patch is to improve fvwm menus look by adding a
new style command (ChangeMenuStyle) and rewriting the old good MenuStyle
now you can put a gradient (any angle), a pixmap or a solid color (any
more ideas ?), you can have a different style for every Popup (!!).
	It looks really nice, and I've working a lot in my fvwm2rc file, I
think it's by far the best I've seen in usualommon pages (hehe), I've made
some icons and include the best ones I've found and finally I have a
really cool ToolBox with FvwmButtons and different wmaker aware apps
docked on it.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I am running FVWM 2.0.46, and have noticed an intermittent bug that is 
finally starting to vex me enough to say something about it.

Every once in a while, for no reason I can discern, Fvwm stops
interpreting most, but not all, of the mouse and key bindings I have
specified in the .fvwm2rc file.

No mouse sequences (modified or not) will work in the root window.
I have desktop (virtual screen) navigation bound to `Control <arrow>'
for all the arrow keys.  These stop working.  I have `Shift <mouse
button)' bound to window raise, window lower (different mouse
buttons); these stop working.  Bindings to window buttons and borders
still work, however.

Restarting Fvwm does not solve the problem.

I looked through the mailing list archives, but was unable to find
anything on this.

I would appreciate if anyone can offer any help.  I am not a list
subscriber, so please CC responses to me.  I will be happy to post a
summary of responses to the list in a little while.  Thanks,

CJW

An admittedly lethargic active development though...

Yes, that original post aggrivated me quite a bit at first, but then I
realized that I was really more upset with myself for not having
enough time to do the work on fvwm that I really wanted to.  So I've
come to a decision, which I'll outline below...

I've had many people write me (both on the mailing list and directly)
citing that same cathedral/bazaar paper:

  http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html

It's not that I was deliberately choosing the "cathedral" method of
development, but I just didn't have enough time to truly do a more
frequent development cycle.  I really wanted to (eventually) get a
good 2.1.0 version out, and then start dual stable & development
paths.  As you can see, I haven't quite made it there yet.

GJGG>   Sorry if it seems so, but I only want to cooperate with you in

I was hoping that was the case.

Several months between updates has been the norm for me for the past
couple of years, unfortunately, so I'm not sure that I would consider
5 months to be a "long" time considering that...

Please hold off on putting another fvwm pseudo-distribution out
there.  It really confuses things...

GJGG>   Any more info appreciated (mainly more patches I must include)

Ok, more info (and the decision I mentioned above):

As of today I'm giving up being fvwm's maintainer.  Unfortunately I've
finially decided to face facts and accept that I don't currently have
anywhere near the amount of time to devote to fvwm that it should
probably have.  It was a painful decision, but probably for the best
(besides, I guess I can still submit ideas and patches periodically).

I wish to thank everyone that has helped out, submitted patches &
ideas, or just plain used fvwm over the years that I've been involved
with it, especially the folks on the mailing lists.

In the not so distant past I spoke offline with Brady Montz, and I
asked if he might like to take over maintainership from me when I was
ready to give it up, as I felt that he was one of a few good
candidates from the mailing lists and that he might have more time to
devote that I do.  At the time he said he was interested.  After I
made my decision this morning, I wrote him again to ask if he was
still interested, but unforutunately haven't heard back from him yet.
I really wanted to hear back from Brady first before I wrote anything
to the mailing lists, but decided that I should speak up before too
many messages flew back and forth without my input (hope you don't
mind, Brady).  In the event that Brady has changed his mind and
doesn't want to (or can't) take over, I'm sure we'll be able to find
someone else.  I'll be sure and announce when this is all decided.

So, what's next?  Well, I'll hand over my current development snapshot
to the next maintainer after that's settled and they can start with
that or just toss it out and start with 2.0.46, whichever works out
better for them.  Then we'll see where they drive it...

My parting thoughts on the future of fvwm:

        - Please try and keep the base code lightweight, standalone
          (ie - minimal external code usage beyond Xpm), and as
          generic as possible.  Granted, it still needs more cleanup.
        - The configuration language definitely needs some more
          improvement, but I don't think I quite agree with adding an
          extension language like Guile, Tcl, Python, etc as I think
          they are all overkill.  Just my 2 cents on the subject since
          I was out of town and unable to respond when this thread
          came up again recently.
        - The current module interface needs more work as well, and
          should probably be encapsulated in another little lib to be
          shared amongst the modules as much as possible.
        - Dynamically loaded modules that use hooks into existing fvwm
          routines to make for tighter integration is probably worth
          looking into.  That'd probably help with modules being able
          to muck with decorations, multiple language interpreters,
          etc.

I could probably put down more, but I guess the TO-DO list and the
notes I keep in my local development ChangeLog already cover all this
and more...

That's enough rambling for now I guess.  Please be kind and
understanding to the next maintainer.  It's been fun.

Thanks,
Chuck

Just to note, I will continue to supply mailing list, FTP and web service
for as long as it is wanted.  I can also provide a CVS tree (with anonymous
access and CVSweb) and anonymous rsync access.  I still don't have the time
to coordinate development, though.

OK, I copped the man pages from the '0.46 source & installed them.

Next stoopid question is, I can get a FvwmPager up, no problem.  I'm using 4 
desks, and naming the desks is trivial.  How do I get the pager to iconify, 
then expand to show all 4 desks using NoHandles, or is this impossible?

First off, I'd like to second Jason's sentiments and thank Chuck for all the
work he's done so far. he was particularly helpful with me a while back as I
muddled through the module API docs while writing the X11::Fvwm module for
Perl5.

I concur that Brady, if he has the time, is the best choice for picking up the
Fvwm mantle. However, if brady cannot do it, I will offer a slice of my 
(admittedly limited) spare time. I'd prefer it went to Brady, though.

I've had to think about this a bit since it's quite a time commitment, but I
think I'm willing to do it. I'd want to look into a way of splitting the
development between among a small group of people, perhaps with a public CVS
source tree with all checkins to be approved by me. Does anyone have
suggestions along this line?

	Well, I think you have take the right way, your work in fvwm2
has been really fantastic, but GPL makes these things easier :)
I hope Brady will take over it, and I hope he'd choose a more open 
development mode, just because (IMHO) it is the only way to have a chance
against wm like WindowMaker, AfterStep, or Enlightment; I really have
no idea of what the current state of your fvwm2 devlopment tree is, so
may be I am wrong (I hope so :)

	And about my patch, I've almost finished, and after great work
I have applied it to smr-2.0.46.4 version of fvwm (the one with the 
autoconf), I will post a snapshot tomorrow (Tuesday GMT), beacuse many
people have misunderstand what the patch is made for, I hope you like
it and decide to include it in the main tree. Another important thing
may be to choose a good indentation mode (I just think currently (2.0.46)
indentation is a bit chaotic) because if you choose a baazar approach
it would be too late :)

	Well, after all, things are changing in the fvwm2 scene, and
I can just wait to the day fvwm2 rulez again!

	Thanks Charles for all your good work (I hope you'd continue
active development, your experience is just too valued to be lost),
thanks!

The next time this happens, look down at your keyboard.  Is your NumLock
on?  Turn it off and things should restore themselves to normal (and if
they don't immediately, try holding down all of your shift, alt, and
control keys at the same time and then releasing).  It's no bug--numlock
does something to your toggle status.

If your NumLock is off...then I don't know :)

Well, I'm happy to run a CVS tree (because I'm already running one for
another project).  There's no way to do 'approved' checkins other than
having folks mail you patches for you to commit.  CVS is really quite
useful, though.

BTW, it's probably best to hammer out any details on fvwm-workers and let
the main list know what the result is and what they can expect.  I've set
Reply-To: appropriately.

Chuck,

It's sad to hear that you have decided to leave as fvwm2 maintainer.
It would be nice if Brady does takeover development, and Jason
mentioning CVS does sound like a good idea.  I just hope fvwm2 doesn't
splinter (at least not with the same name fvwm).

Please do drop in occasionally though so we don't suffer from
withdrawal symptoms :-).

Best regards,
Andrew

Hi,

I guess there'll be too many of these messages, but I wanted to say
thankyou to Chuck for all his efforts on fvwm - they are much
appreciated!

Regards,
James.

I'm sorry that I've been harsh to chuck in late '96, when I wanted to speed
up development. He wasn't ready to pass on the torch, then and he still has
not enough time to review all that patches and still do own modifications.

yes: try do a complete split & reindentation of the code as fast as
possible, so that work can begin.

I'd like to have a more methodically split: e.g: menu code was spilled over
several files in 2.0.43-45, don't know of .46

Indentation is pretty bad, since people had to keep the patches small
(diff -w is no good for indentation)




To get rid of the patches-backlog, you should get development up & running
as fast as possible, with a quick brushed up release as a basis for all
those patches. (don't try to first include gazillions of patches that were
for 2.0.43 to .45) 

Then you should ask the authors of the most important patches to redo them
for that release. Then you can quickly select / apply those.
I don't think they'll be offended, if they have to redo a patch once and
then have it included.
Many of these patches have been re-done several times, because they didn't
make it into .41, then they didn't make it into .42 and so on.


After this catchup on the patches backlog, most of the "I detected a bug in
2.0.46" -> "Yes it's been there since 2.0.39, use this workaround" traffic
on the lists should cease, leaving more time to fiddle with code.




Then we can focus on the unknown bugs and enhancements.

BTW:
we should still finish the discussion, wether we want

	1) a new language / languages ??
	2) export fvwm's data & special functionality
	3) reinvent the wheel while adding one feature after the other to
		the existing language (delay ?).
	
I already posted an idea to have fvwm-core without any language, but just a
bytecode interpreter (maybe with a callout for unknown opcodes).

The syntax-analyzer / semantic parser would be a standalone program
producing bytecode output, being piped to fvwm.
We could even have different ones.
Modules would also output bytecode -> no redundant syntax & semantic
checking.

The bytecode interpreter (i.e. most of current functions.c & builtins.c)
would be a shared library which can be unloaded (swapped out !), when all
configuration is done and no functions have been defined (minimal user).
We could even split the language into a startup config part (always
unloaded) and a dynamic executing part (functions)


this is all some sort of brainstorm, so don't hesitate to comment, ask for
elaboration, etc ...
I also hope you don't mind the intermixing of we / you. I tried to use "you"
for things only You (as the maintainer) can do, and "we" for things we can
do as patches, that can be included fairly easy, when there's a comon base
for patching. (2.0.46 ?, 2.0.46 autoconf, what versions else do exist now)

Maybe we can re-acquire some spin-offs or borrow / lift some code there ?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

So, I think I should feel stupid...  My original post was about a
problem with FVWM `forgetting' its mouse and key bindings for no
apparent reason.

Two different people (Nathan Clegg <moramis@mcmuse.mc.maricopa.edu>
and Dan Espen <dane@mk.bellcore.com>) suggested that the NumLock key
might be the culprit.  I find myself a little surprised, because I
hardly ever use the keypad and am not sure how I would be activating
NumLock, but, sure enough---hitting NumLock causes what appear to be
the same symptoms, taking NumLock back off brings things back to
normal.

So, the next time this problem `spontaneously' occurs :-) I will be
sure to look for the stupid little green light.  (Or just use xkeycaps
to disable the stupid NumLock key to start with... :->)

Thanks for the quick responses,

CJW

caps lock also causes the same behavior and if you switch between several
keyboard styles like I do missing up ctrl and cap lock is quite easy.

	Well, here it is, my first version of this patch which will
change your menu looks (I hope to a better one).

	It's made against fvwm-smr-2.0.46.4 by Steve Robbins (I can't
remenber the URL, please post it Steve ).

	I'm wait for your opinions ...    (not your critics ;)

Well, it's officially decided that I will be taking over the fvwm
development. I'd like to thank Chuck for his years of service and stellar
attitude. 

He's handed off the development tree to me. I have to take my PhD prelims May
28, and I have to to a code walkthrough, before I'll be able to do any real
work on the code. I will probably release the current code as 2.0.47 with the
minimum number of changes and set up a public CVS repository. I hope to have
that done in the first week of June. I'd like to ask everybody who has any
patches > 10 lines to wait until then.

Since this endless march of "beta" versions appears to be confusing to various
distributors and sysadmins, causing them to keep their users at fvwm 1.24, I
plan to split fvwm development into a stable 2.2 version (released ASAP after
freezing feature additions when 2.0.47 is released) and development version
2.3. Note that I am skipping 2.1 altogether to get fvwm in sync with the
linux/xemacs convention of odd minor versions for development versions and
even for release versions.

Version 2.3 will be for incremental improvements to fvwm, targeted towards a
stable release in 6-12 months. Since I think fvwm might need some ground-up
redesign to support things like loadable modules, potential embedded
languages, etc, I will probably start a 2.9 source tree for the truly
speculative and adventurous changes. I think that loadable modules alone would
warrant a major number increase to 3.0. 2.9 will have to wait until 2.0, 2.2,
and 2.3 are running smoothly however, so this might occur towards the end of
the summer.

I don't know if anyone else knows this but some of the nwere xterms give
you an option for active icons.

But I seem to get a bit of odd behavior with them when I use fvwm2.
Basically I bring up the xterm do some stuff and its find until I resize.
As soon as I resize it goes craxy and it shrinks down to the 4 handles +
the cursor and scrollbar width.  Anyone else see anything likes this and
can tell me what I did wrong?  it only seems to happen under fvwm.
Solaris CDE, and twm don't do it.

Thanks,
Brad

I think it would be a useful thing if fvwm could support installable
packages.  A package would be a set of related files needed to
configure fvwm in some special way.

What I have in mind is to add a new command in fvwm's configuration
file syntax:

    AddPackage Name [Preprocessor command]

	name is the name of a directory somewhere in the current
	ModulePath.  The command interpreter adds this directory to
	the current ModulePath, PixmapPath, and IconPath.  This
	directory must have a "package.rc" file within it that may
	contain fvwm configuration commands.

	The preprocessor command, if specified, would be some program
	that would be used to preprocess the package.rc file.  FvwmM4
	and FvwmCpp come to mind here.  If not specified, the
	package.rc file is read directly by the command interpreter.

	By convention, the package.rc file only defines menus,
	functions, and module configurations, all prefixed wherever
	possible by the package directory name.  Also, by convention,
	a function named Init (prefixed by the packagethe name) is
	used to "implement" the package.

	The files within the package directory could contain whatever
	is necessary to implement the package...  module executables,
	pixmaps, bitmaps, etc.

As an example, let's create a Windows 95 look and feel package.  To do
this, we would need five files:  three pixmap files (for the minimize,
maximize, and close buttons), a README file (to explain what the
package is for, and to explain how to install it) and a package.rc
file.  I won't include the contents of the pixmap files, but show how
the package would be specified:

- File:  Win95/README
    Win95 Example Package

    This package implements a Windows 95 look and feel for fvwm.
    
    Installation:

	This assumes that you have installed this package as
	/usr/lib/X11/fvwm/Win95.  First, make sure that
	/usr/lib/X11/fvwm is in your ModulePath:

	    ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm

	Then, to have fvwm use the Windows 95 look and feel, add the
	following two lines to the bottom of our .fvwm2rc file:

	    AddPackage Win95
	    Win95Init

- File:  Win95/package.rc:

This package directory should be stored somewhere within the
ModulePath (or we could also create a 'PackagePath' keyword for this
purpose!), and it could be read by the command:

    AddPackage Win95

To get the Windows 95 look and feel, one simply needs to execute the
package's initialization function:

    Win95Init

(This could be anywhere where an fvwm function could be executed... in
the main RC file, or within a menu, for example.)

Since the package is defined to be an entire directory, the package
could be simply distributed as a gzip'ed tar file.  People that want
to tinker with the package will know exactly where to go to find the
file(s) to change.

Packages aren't limited to look and feel issues... they could be used
to specify some neat FvwmButtons configuration, some common menus,
etc.  People could then pick and choose the packages that they want on
their systems.

Fvwm could contain some packages in its distribution to supply
examples of how packages could be implemented.  We could also maintain
a repository for other FVWM packages.

Using the Win95 package that I have just outlined, an answer to a FAQ
(How do I get fvwm to look like Win95?) could be answered easily
(download the package http://some.site/fvwm/packages/win95.tar.gz and
follow the README file within it).

What do people think of this idea?

Sounds like a good idea. I wonder if it is a good idea to overload the
modulepath for this, since a package really isn't a module. I'd prefer using
PackagePath. For example, I typically have my modules somewhere in my ~/bin
hierarchy, since they are platform dependant binaries (I have subdirectories
in ~/bin for each OS/ARCH combination I use), but would probably want my
packages in a ~/.fvwm directory.

One final thing. One goal I have is to be explore writing actual modules which
can change the look+feel of fvwm, probably implemented as dynamically loaded
libraries. So, for example, somebody could decide at fvwm run-time whether
they want the texuture code loaded or not, depending on their display depth. I
suspect this could make fvwm more streamlined and organized. Anyhow, it seems
that this package idea would map pretty easily to a way to specify which
modules are loaded.

I agree.  Why "packages", though---aren't these going to get called
"themes", and shouldn't we just give in, and call them "themes"?  

Or are "themes" something else again?

Where is the file read from?  From my understanding, it would be in
whatever directory the rc file was found.  Plus, this hasn't added the
directory to the icon and bitmap path, which means that I will have to
install the pixmaps associated with, say, the Win95 look and feel into
another directory.

What I was suggesting was some sort of standardized way of packaging
things for fvwm.  I cannot tell you how many times I've looked at
screen shots of various wm's with their "attached rc files" and hunting
through the rc files finding out how a particular effect was achieved. 
And these RC files may name a certain pixmap file, but finding those
pixmaps can be a hassle.

Having a standard way to package these things could allow people to
display a screen shot and a minimalist package to achieve a particular
effect.  Not everybody is going to create a specialized "AddPackage"
function for this; it's better if fvwm directly supported it so
everybody can use a package without having to write the function first.

and...

Themes would seem to be what "decors" are in fvwm -- and I didn't want
the idea to be limited to just look and feel.

I can think of a number of useful "packages" for fvwm... win95, mac,
motif look and feels are just a start.  How about a package that uses
FvwmPager and FvwmButtons to create a CDE work bar?  How about a package
that uses FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan to create a Win95 style task bar? 
(Pssssst, Brady...  FvwmIconMan doesn't support the use of multiple
confurations like 'Module FvwmButtons PagerButtons' does!)


Another example... what is the big difference between fvwm95 and fvwm2?
The Win95 look and feel.  Also, they incorporated a FvwmTaskBar module,
which Chuck brought into 2.0.46.  Why can't these two projects be
merged back into a single window manager with an supplied package that
optionally provides the fvwm95 look?

	Well, here there is a new version (I'm releasing even faster that 
Linus :), it repair some problems with interaction between MWM FVWM and 
NEXT menus, no you can mix them in any way you like, I have changed the 
Scr struct heavely (mainly deleting items) and have removed the flags 
MWMMenus and FVWMMenus, including them in the MenuFace struct.

	Hope you enjoy it.

PS: It's made against fvwm-smr-2.0.46.4 (so you must reverse my last 
patch before installing this new version)

PSS: This is the last version I'm posting to both lists, I'm going out of
the Fvwm plain list (I mean I would keep only the workers list), because
I have started to hate receiving duplicated messages (that this one :)

PSSS: Brady, if you receive it Email me to confirm, if not I will resend 
it to you for your approval. (Aye Aye Sir :)

PSSSS: What the hell this PSSSS mean ;)

        I've had couple of reports of dramatic performance improvement
with the Stacking Order patch I submitted over the weekend. It seems to
have turned out far better than I'd expected when I started working on
it.

        Of course, all hell broke loose immediately afterwards, so I
was a little surprised that anyone noticed it - particulary with that
catchy subject line!  :-)

        I'll do my best to get it reworked for the new code base as
soon as Brady makes it available.

        I'm very much saddened to hear that Chuck is having to hand
over custodianship of my Favorite Virtual Window Manager to a new
maintainer. I'm sorry that this brave and painful decision had to
be made. 

        I wish Brady the best of luck in his new role (as well as
in his upcoming doctoral exams).

        Chuck, I do hope your schedule will allow you to continue to
participate from time to time in the role of Guru Emeritus. Thanks for
your many contributions and your leadership over the past few years.

Hi,

I've been using FVWM for two years now, and like it more than any
other window manager I've tried.  Along with the others, I'd like to
thank Chuck for all his hard work, and wish good luck to Brady.


Bill

I'm trying to add general functions to my .fvwm2rc file to handle
different variations of the same task--starting remote xterms on local,
networked machines.

Instead of lots of lines of:

rsh -n -l maxwell dellpro "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -display maxwax:0.0"

I want to do:

AddToFunc RemoteShell
+ "I" Exec rsh -n -l $1 $2 "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $3"

$1 = user to login on remote as
$2 = remote host system name
$3 = name of X display SERVER to which output of xterm will be placed.

Then, I could make menus with:

AddToMenu MyMenu
+ "Remote on toronto" RemoteShell maxwell toronto "maxwax:0.0"
+ "Remote on dellpro" RemoteShell mstar   dellpro "maxwax:0.0"

etc.

This isn't working at all, and I haven't been able to find examples of
calling functions with numbered parameters.. Anybody else doing this?
Anybody want to make an attempt to get it working and show me how its
done?

Thanks!

>From the manual:
 
          The special symbols $w and $0 through $9 are  available
          in the ComplexFunctions or Macros, or whatever you want
          to call them. Within a macro, $w  is  expanded  to  the
          window-id (expressed in hex, ie 0x10023c) of the window
          for which the macro was called. $0 though  $9  are  the
          arguments to the macro, so if you call
(useful example follows!!!)

So, change it to:

AddToFunc RemoteShell 
+ "I" Exec rsh -n -l $0 $1 "/usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $2"

It works.

"man fvwm2" is a quite useful reading for the fvwm2 user ;-)

Happy reading,

Using Fvwm2, I have an FvwmButtons module located in the top left corner
of my screen.  It extends down about 40 pixels and across to the right
about 800 pixels.  No border, Always on top, to describe it briefly.

When I start Netscape, Netscape positions itself slightly underneath the
buttons, so each time I start Netscape or ask Netscape to open a new
browser window, I immediately have to pull the window down below my
FvwmButtons area.

Is there an Fvwm2 or Netscape configuration change I can make so that
Netscape will be placed according to the open space on my screen, not
under FvwmButtons?

FYI, I have these already:

Style "*" ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
Style "*" MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride

Style "Netscape" Icon netpositive.xpm

And no other general purpose or Netscape specific settings that I can
find.  I'm very interested in hearing if others are just accepting this
annoying behaviour. :)

Duhhhhhh, my error. I forgotten that unlike some shells, Fvwm has $0 for
the first parameter, not $1. OOPS.

> "man fvwm2" is a quite useful reading for the fvwm2 user ;-)

Oh, I read it, hence, that's why I was able to ask the question.  Just a
class programming overlook error.

Works fine now, thanks Josi.

Subject line says it all really - I'm running fvwm 2.0.46 and RealPlayer
won't take the focus - it just stays in it's background style, and won't
accept any keyboard events.

Something in the config file, no doubt, but I don't know what.



thanks,

Look for "Lenience" in the man page.

Hi all, 

I'd just like to add my vote of thanks to all those others that have
been sent in. Without FVWM to play with I'd probably have finished my
doctorate by now, but instead I have a really cool looking AND
FUNCTIONAL desktop.

Cheers Chuck,


Martin.

Hello guys,

I always wanted to ask this -- how do I (or is it possible to) change the
style of xterm or do some fvwm2 magic to ensure the following behaviour:

whenever I make an xterm (nxterm, xterm-color, etc) active either by
selecting from the TaskList or by clicking on it through the FvwmPager I
want it's window to come on top instead of letting FvwmButtons stay there.
I always have to click on the caption to bring it to the top -- which is
slightly annoying.

Otherwise -- fvwm2 is a great window manager -- I was using it for a very
long time and still am very happy :)

Regards,

First create two useful functions in your .fvwm2rc:

    DestroyFunc	"FocusAndWarp"
    AddToFunc	"FocusAndWarp" \
      "I"	Raise
    + "I"	Focus
    + "I"	Iconify -1
    + "I"	WarpToWindow	50 50

    DestroyFunc	"RunAndFocus"
    AddToFunc	"RunAndFocus" \
      "I"	Exec $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
    + "I"	Next [$0] FocusAndWarp

Next, in your FvwmButtons configuration, create a button for your
xterm as follows:

    *FvwmButtons(Title xterm-myhost, Action "RunAndFocus xterm-myhost \
		/usr/bin/X11/xterm -title xterm-myhost")

Hello,

Thanks for your solution -- it certainly works. However, I have found even
simpler solution -- just put StaysOnTop in the Style for xterm/nxterm/rxvt
whatever. It has the disadvantage that if you start some X app from that
xterm you can't see it unless you give it focus manually (through
WinList). This drawback is present in your solution as well.

Anyway, thanks.

Hi:

I just downloaded and compiled the latest version
of fvwm on an IRIX64 machine.
Unfortunately, it coredumps somewhere in
CaptureAllWindows before it gets to execute
the InitFunction.
Does anybody know how to fix this problem?
(I tried different and no config files)

Hi,

I'm new to fvwm but a long-time tvtwm user.

tvtwm has one function that I really miss -- f.scrollback.
This function causes the viewport to scroll back to the last visited desktop.

For example, if I pressed Ctrl-RightArrow while the viewport is at (0,0),
the viewport is now at (0,1).  I'll like to bind a key or button to switch
back to (0,0.

I searched but could find a straightforward fvwm function.

Is there a way to do this?

Thanks for your help!

I'm pretty new to FVWM so please forgive the newbie-lian nature of my
question. Does anyone have a nice keyboard method of selecting
windows? Right now I have the following lines in my .fvwmrc:

Key F3          A       M       Module "WindowList" FvwmWinList

which pops up FvwmWinList, but this still requires mouse selection. My
other method is 

Key F7          A       M       CirculateUp
Key F8          A       M       CirculateDown

But to use these I have to flip through a bunch of windows before I
get to the one I want. 

Thanks for your help,
Alan

I use:

  Key o   A  3    WindowList

The window in the list are numbered, and you can select any window by
typing its number (1-9, and A-Z are used if there are more than 9
windows in the list). Alternatively, you can you the arrow keys to move=

up and down the list, and RETURN to select.

If using this, you may want to set=20

  Style "..." WindowListSkip

for classes of windows you feel confident you never want to select this=

way (e.g. xclock).

Gentlepeople,
    I have a question about the FvwmPager module
which supports FVWM95.
I am trying to limit the number of 'Pages' per
desktop and I am not quite sure
how to accomplish this. I currently set 'FvwmPager
0 3' in my .fvwm95rc file
and the pager comes up with what I assume is
6(six) default 'pages' per desktop.
I only want 1(one) page per desktop. How can I do
this??

Thanks in advance

Chris Colley

you need to put

where 1x1 says 1 page across 1 page down

DeskTopSize  NxM
gives you an NxM physical screen sized desktop.
The default is 1x2, I think.

   I only want 1(one) page per desktop. How can I do

Easiest way is to use FvwmButtons + FvwmIconMan to create your own
personal task bar.  This is what I have done.  Instead of a start
menu, I have an "xload" showing my workstation load.  In the "system
tray" area I have:

- An icon that runs a screen saver
- An icon that allows me to run some window selection scripts
- An icon that warps to Netscape (or runs it if it isn't already
  running)
- An icon that displays the status of the printers attached to my
  systerm.
- An icon that runs xclipboard (VERY useful!)
- An icon that allows me to either modify my .fvwm2rc files or restart
  fvwm (via menu pick)
- An icon that terminates fvwm (effectively logging me off)
- A "swallowed" tcl/tk application that displays the current time, and
  (if pressed) warps to my mailer (or runs it if it isn't currently
  running).

I have found FvwmButtons very versatile for providing this sort of
functionality, and FvwmIconMan provides the "task list" in a similar
manner that FvwmTaskBar does.  And with FvwmButtons, you have COMPLETE
control over how your task bar looks.

Anyway, I've MIME-attached a tiny GIF file that shows you what my task
bar looks like.  And, if anybody is interested, send me private email
(NOT A REQUEST ON THIS LIST!) and I will send the pertinent sections
of my .fvwm2rc files.  My example assumes a 1280x1024 screen, but the
"magic numbers" can be fudged...  for example, I have a slightly
modified version of this configuration at home that works equally well
on my 1280x1024 and 1152x864 screens, thanks to the magic of FvwmM4.

Well... not _COMPLETE_ control :)

I just have to toss my inevitable complaints about "minor"
nits... although this actually annoys me quite a bit sometimes.

The one thing I like about tkgoodstuff over FvwmButtons (besides the
graphical construction windows--which I certainly don't _need_ but is
nice anyway--and the builtin widgets like tkgjots and webster) is that
tkgoodstuff "packs" buttons; that is, each button takes up exactly as
much space as it needs, and no more.

Sure, buttons are different widths but that doesn't bother me.  It
allows me to fit more onto my button bar, _and_ (most importantly) it
allows me to swallow other apps and have the display exactly the right
size, instead of the nearest "button size" offset, which can make things
look odd.

Agreed.

I have a icon which runs xpaste, so all I have to do is highlight something,
click the icon, and my selected text pops up in a sticky window (as I have the 
xpaste style sticky). Coolness.

I used to use xcb, but it was too "heavyweight" for that task for my taste,
although it's a cool program too.

I wanted to be able to double click on the button on the top left
corner of a window to close it.

I tried this in my .fvwmrc but it doesn't work:

Mouse 0         1       N       Function "window_ops_func"

Function "window_ops_func"
        PopUp   "Click"         Window Ops2
        PopUp   "Motion"        Window Ops2
        Delete  "DoubleClick"  
EndFunction

Gentlepeople,

I have a question about licensing/copywrite issues
concerning
FVWM95 does anyone know about these ( If they
exist)?

 Is there any known limitation on using this
product as
a window manager for a US ARMY/Government project?

Thanks in advance

 I don't think that fvwm2 should be considered to be competing with
other window managers. I would prefer to think of it as each window
manager having its own philosophy and goals, and one works to make the
window manager come as close to those goals as possible. Some people
may like the philosophy; some people may not. It would be wrong to add
things that go against the philosophy just to attract more users.

 I'm biased, of course, because I like fvwm2's current philosophy,
and I don't like the philosophy of other window managers (or I'd
probably be using one of them).

Hmm.  What _is_ fvwm2's current philosophy?

What are the others'?

I compiled it off the shelf without any modification.
I am running fvwm2 for an Xterminal so I do not know
in how far  your color comments apply.
I finally downloaded the source for 2.0.38 which works fine.

Well, I had the  same thought, but then I  re-read the  Description on
the fvwm2 man page and that satisfied me.

If  anything sets fvwm2  apart, its that its  small and  fast, and has
just the right amount of built-in features.

When running fvwm 2.0.46 on a machine with multiple displays, I get
some weird behaviour when lowering windows on the second display.

If i try to lower a window, it is placed behind all other windows that
are beneath the pointer, but stays on top of any windows not below the
pointer. Everything works fine on the first display.

Anybody else seen this?

It's me again. Just now I got around to playing with the screen grab
stuff and am still having problems.
As I mentioned before, xv (3.10a) will not grab fvwm2 screens but has
no problem with other window managers. Running at 1024x768, 16bpp.
I now get errors that I never received before. I'm in DOS now so
I sorta forgot it. :-)  Something like 'can't grab 0,0 1024x760'.

Anyway, tried xwd as mentioned. Xwd created images that are near black
so they're useless. Almost like someone turned out the lights on the
image. This happens with other wm's also.
Just read on a newsgroup that xwd doesn't support above 8bpp.
Is this true?

Any suggestions on another app with screen grab features?
Not sure if KDE's ksnapshot would work outside of KDE (don't ksnapshot
yet anway).
Thanks,

xv screen grabs work for me.  I set them to autograb with a 5 second delay, 
hide xv.  When xv comes back, page over to another portion of the desktop, or 
change desktops, then come back and click your left button on the xv *picture* 
title bar.

I've never been able to figure out how to convert them to a useable format.  
For whatever reason (99.999% likely, *operator error*), I've never been able 
to get ImageMagick installed right.

No clue.  I'm running Accel-X at 16 bbp, never been able to get XF86_SVGA to 
go above 8 bbp with my Trident 9440 2 meg card.  *(

Well, I've never found XV's screen grab utils to be very stable (shame
tho). I don't like KDE so I wouldn't suggest it... I don't think XWD works
with anything better than 8bit displays. 

My suggestion would be to use GIMP ... as early as the 0.99.29 release of
GIMP, there's been a grabbing (screen, window, rubberband) feature.

Well, it also ought to be configurable to a significant extent,
consistent with it being small.  

One of the things which I find useful is that it's *documented*.  I
had a look at WindowMaker recently, but just couldn't get it to be
usable.  There is documentation, but it seems out of date.  I
understand there's an extra program that I could have got, which would
have made the configuration point and drool, but there was no clear
advice to do that.  So I'm back with my comfortable fvwm2 setup.

fvwm2's documentation and configuration may be a bit weighty, but it's
all there.

...and it has some useful modules ready to go. I use two button bars and
a pager. I really can't live without the pager. I tried scwm which some
have touted as the "future" of fvwm. But I couldn't figure out how to
transfer my button bars & pager. Until someone gets around to providing
that level of functionality on the newer window managers I will stick
with fvwm. I would hope that the development comunity would not abandon
fvwm just yet. We need you!

Although I agree with everything that has been said (and note that `fvwm2'
is the most widely used window manager at our company by a huge margin,
thanks to a user-configurable "standard configuration" I came up with using
the wonders of FvwmM4), there are some things that I would like to see
addressed in future versions of `fvwm2':

 . It should support multi-headed displays without having to run multiple
   copies of itself. `vtwm' and other window managers can do it, `fvwm2'
   should do it as well.

 . Likewise, it would be nice if programs like FvwmButtons and FvwmPager
   could support multiple instantiations without having to run a separate
   copy for each button bar/pager/etc.

 . The idea of forking a new application to do auto-raise, window list,
   etc. seems totally silly to me. I would much rather have "dynamically"
   loadable routines linked in when I start `fvwm2' and see just a single
   process listed when I do a `ps': fvwm2. Not: fvwm2 (twice, once for each
   screen), FvwmAuto (twice, once for each screen), FvwmButtons
   (twice, one for each screen), FvwmPager (twice, once for each screen),
   etc. Not to mention all the memory wasted by having all these modules
   "separate". Although it is difficult to tell how much memory FvwmAuto
   is *really* using (due to shared libraries and such), my guess is that it
   is not insignificant:

   USER       PID %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS TT       S    START  TIME COMMAND
   eddy      5954  0.2  1.2 2576 1424 console  S 09:17:17  0:00 FvwmAuto
   eddy      5955  0.1  1.2 2576 1424 console  S 09:17:17  0:00 FvwmAuto

   Seems kind of silly when a feature like "auto raise" is really only a
   a few K of code. I would much rather see this features somehow "dynamically
   linked" to `fvwm2' at run-time (adding that few K of code to `fvwm2's
   process space instead of forking a whole new process).

Just my thoughts!

Eddy

P.S. I've patched `fvwm2-2.0.46' to add some useful features:

     . Automatic pointer warp to transient windows (great for programs
       like Netscape that pop-up Find windows and such.) This would be
       a great "style" feature (i.e., WarpToTransients/NoWarpToTransients).

     . When placing a window (i.e., dragging around the "grid"), I have
       redefined the mouse buttons to work as follows:

       Button 1 = Place window (no change)
       Button 2 = Place window, but allow it to be resized (i.e., while
                  holding button 2, you can drag to the window borders and
                  resize it while it is being placed. Very useful). If you
                  don't use the "mmw" style menus, this works already.
                  If you use "mmw" style menus, you can see how this works
                  by holding down "shift" and using Button 1. Not sure why
                  this feature is tied to mmw-styled menus, but I'd rather
                  see it always mapped to button 2.
       Button 3 = Place window, but maximize its height (i.e., when you
                  click button 3, you select the top-left corner of the
                  window, but it is automatically resized so that it extends
                  all the way to the bottom of the screen. Great for xterms.)

     If there is any interest in these patches, let me know where to send
     them. I'd love to see them included in the next release of fvwm2.

Yes, it ought to do this.  Actually, I thought it did, but I've never
been in a position to try.

Why is this important?  Don't the multiple instantiations share most
of their memory?

Yes, some features look silly as modules.  Dynamic loading is a good
idea, and nowadays it's reasonably doable.  Back in the old days (when
the modules were first introduced) dynamic loading was much more of a
nightmare, and I suspect that's why Robert didn't try to offer that as
a mechanism.  (Some things do make sense as separate processes,
though, in the absense of preemptive threading, which is difficult
with Xlib apparently.)

I'd like dynamic lowering too, to remove windows that I'm obviously
not interested in.

Hi,
I just discovered the wonderful WindowList function:
Mouse 2         R       A       WindowList

I do have a small problem with it after using it constantly --
the cursor is placed at the corner of the window when I select
that window.  Is there a way to place the cursor in the middle
of the window instead?

I'm running fvwm2 on both sparc and intel solaris2 (2.6, and 2.7 beta) in
8,16,24, and 32 bpp modes -- 1280x1024 screen generally, but I tried both
larger (1600x1200) and smaller (1024x768) and tried the screen grab in xv
3.10a -- it worked just fine here.  Is there anything else that could be
effecting things, like
	a) wierd permissions on devices,
	b) running your display without doing the semi-obligatory
		xhost + (whatever your hostname is),
	c) dynamic libraries updated since the build of xv, or
	d) dynamic libraries updated since the build of fvwm2 (or a binary
		distribution of unknown build status)?

Just my $0.02 worth...

Dunno -- don't use it.

As I recall, ImageMagic also has a screen-grab feature... (pause) ...

Yep -- I just tried it, and it does (if you don't have ImageMagic, you can 
download it from ftp.x.org in /contrib/applications/ImageMagick) -- the
utility which has this capability is "display". (It worked ok on both Solaris/
SunOS, and on HP-UX 10.xxxxx, anyway -- I don't have any Linux around to try it
on at the moment.

Good luck,

Hi,

Currently the windows in the WindowList list are sorted by
desk number and Z order.

I think it would be very useful to offer a sort-by-Most-
Recently-Used option.

With a MRU list, one can flash back-and-forth between the current
and last window in different desks simply by selecting the top
entry of the window list.  One can also go down further in the
list to select windows visited less recently.

Even better, with an option to suppress the WindowList title,
one can simply click mouse 2 on the desktop to flash back.

Good news, I passed my prelims yesterday.
Mixed news, I'm flying to Des Moines to visit my dying grandma (sad part) and
eat lots of corn-fed prime rib (happy part).

So, I haven't gotten much done on 2.0.47 except look it over, and won't until
at least next week.

volunteer request:
-----------------

I'd like two things:

1. A list of people who want to alpha test. Along with a name I want to know:
  a. architecture/OS used
  b. modules used (me: FvwmM4, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan, FvwmIdent)
  c. "extensions" used (things with defines in Fvwm.tmpl) (me: shape,
     miniicons, pixmap buttons, titlestyle)

People on this list will get to alpha test the new release (probably future
releases too) and will be expected to give a complete testing/report (reminder 
email sent after a week). Sounds like fun, eh? 

2. A repository of fvwmrc's on the website (along with all icons, scripts,
   etc.  used and a list of any environment variables and options in Fvwm.tmpl
   which need to be set so that people can just run them without going mad)
   organized by features. So if someone wants to use some fvwmrc's using
   gradients, they can find them. It would probably also be cool if people
   submitted "truncated" fvwmrc's which only had the configuration for some
   module, for example, all of their *FvwmButtons lines long with any Style
   commands which modify how FvwmButtons looks. I would like to have a
   volunteer to get this running too. This volunteer (unlike those poor souls
   for #1) would probably get lots of happy feedback.

Both xv and xwd don't work with mixed visuals - i.e. if your default visual
is 8bpp, but you're grabbing windows that are 16 or 24 bits deep. If that
isn't the case, then they're fine; if, on the other hand, you do have that
case you get what you described - black images. They both work with 24 bits
- or, at least, the vanilla X11R6.3 and Solaris 2.5 xwd work with 24 bits. I
do not know about 16bpp.

ImageMagick, on the other hand, handles mixed visuals with no problem. (The
command-line utility to do a screen grab in ImageMagick is 'import'; grabs
can also be done with 'display'.) I use ImageMagick because of this, and
also because it supports more image formats (not to mention being actively
maintained...).

Note, also, that with your 16bpp display could be TrueColour or
PseudoColour. In the latter case, you have a (rather large) colourmap; it is
unlikely that xv and xwd would expect to get a 64K colourmap instead of the
usual 256.

You can find out what your default visual is with 'xdpyinfo', and you can
find out what a particular window is with 'xwininfo'.

I will try to fix the VNC X server to work with 16bpp and test xv, xwd, and
ImageMagick with that later today.

GIMP - at least early versions I tried - did not work at all with
non-TrueColour displays (it made invalid assumptions about what could be
done with colourmapped displays). If your display is TrueColour, then it's
feasible; otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.

I have a page with several fvwm configuration examples on it.
(http://www.public.iastate.edu/~crode/fvwm).  However, I have come to
realize over the last several months (almost a year) that the page hasn't
been updated, that I don't have the time to keep maintaining it -- that,
and I have switched to enlightenment on my main machine.  I also have
several fvwmrc submissions sitting around that haven't yet been added to
the page.  If whoever volunteers to take on Brady's second request would
like any/all of these, please get in contact with me.  Thanks. :)

Um, this doesn't work for me.
Also, FvwmWinList doesn't wrap to a window in a different desk.
I must be using an older version (I got "1.24r" running strings on fvwm.)

I've found that xv doesn't work properly with 24-bit packed visuals.  32-bit
works, but 24 doesn't.  xwd does work, but xv has the same problem displaying
24-bit xwd files as it does with 24-bit screen captures!  xwud or the GIMP can
display the files ok.

There is also an XV bug where after a grab the window doesn't get updated. 
The grab works ok, but whatever image you were viewing before is still
displayed.  There is a patch for xv that fixes this.

16 bit PseudoColour hardware exists?

GIMP has worked with PseudoColor visuals for a long time now, at least, as
long as I can remember.

Please indicate the release you are running when you report a problem.

I think you will find similar functionality in 1.24r under a different
name, although as I remember the old warp function was by pixels only,
not percent of screen.

I suggest upgrading.

no reason it should the line Dan sent you is for a seperate module
FvwmWinList

what you are looking at is WindowList which is a built in function
that I suppose is internally calling the cursor move. so to make the
behavior you want you probably need to change the source.

Well, looks like I missed giving you a good answer twice in a row, but
I just keep trying.  I think I'm on base with this one.

As long as you are running 1.24r, fixes or updates are unlikely.

Hello,

I have what I hope is a simple question (with a simple answer?).  In
other wm's, you can draw
a rubberband on the root window with mouse button one.  The idea being
that you can select
multiple windows/icons, which can then be acted upon as a group.  Does
this make sense?
Can this be done in fvwm?

Please reply to me personally as I have not subscribed to this list.

Thanks
  -Chris


ps:  I heard there was a port of the fvwm95 taskbar to fvwm2.  Where can
I find it?

This is not a feature of any particular window manager... usually, what
happens is that a desktop program is run that sits on and occupies the
root window. It manages the rubberbanding. I know that even if you run
fvwm2 on an SGI, you can still run IRIX's desktop without using 4Dwm. I
also would assume that you can run KDE's desktop without actually using
kwm as your window manager...

A related feature is regarding transferring all windows of
one desktop to another, which I find myself doing quite often.

I always wished I could drag a desktop on the pager while
holding down some modifier key and the pager would move
all the windows of that desktop to the desktop on which
I released the mouse button.

This would be perfect... if I could get FvwmIconMan to "button-ify" some
of the managers.

What I'd like is to be able to specify that some of the managers just
display a button, then when the button is pressed they'd show all their
managed windows, in a popup window-type thing.

Since there can be only one "transient" manager definition, I don't see
how I can do that by starting up an FvwmIconMan module when an
FvwmButton is pressed (for example), since I'd want different managed
icons depending on which button I pressed.

Plus, I'd prefer not to have to start an icon manager "on-the-fly" as it
takes too long (I still use the builtin winlist bound to mouse-3 instead
of a separate module, for the same reason).

Thanks for the response, though...

I don't know if XFree supports mixed visuals (not having access to a system
running Linux) - take a look at the output of xdpyinfo; if more than one
depth is listed, you've got multiple visuals. I do know that Sun systems
support multiple visuals - one system I've got here supports 1, 8, and 24
bit visuals, with the 8-bit PseudoColour and the 24-bit TrueColour being
displayable simultaneously (i.e. without colourmap flashing):

name of display:    :0.0
version number:    11.0
vendor string:    Sun Microsystems, Inc.
vendor release number:    3510

screen #0:
  depths (2):    1, 8
  number of visuals:    6

screen #1:
  depths (3):    1, 8, 24
  number of visuals:    11

[edited and cut for brevity]

On the other hand, the VNC server I'm using only supports one visual (depth
defined by a command-line option). It's based on the XFree sources, so XFree
itself may only support one visual, too.

-----

Going back to the original question - why xv/xwud dumps show up black -
there are several possiblities:
 1) the grab is of pseudocolour (colourmapped) data but is interpreted as
    TrueColour, resulting in small pixel values (but not black!)
 2) the grab is of TrueColour but the program uses the wrong pixel size (i.=
e.
    24 instead of 16, or 8 bits for each of R, G and B instead of about 5?),
    also resulting in small pixel values (dark but not black)
 3) the grab is of TrueColour but the program is interpreting it as
    PseudoColour with a colourmap filled with 0 (black) values
 4) something else is going on
The first two, of course, may not be that 'black'. Case 3 will be.

'xv' will tell you what sort of image it thinks it has - (for version 3.10)
use 'Image Info' from the 'Windows' menu. This should say something like
'Format: <24-bit internal>' and 'Colors: Using TrueColor visual'. You can
also pull up the colour editor window, which will not only tell you if the
image is colourmapped or not, but will shown you the colourmap, if
applicable.

xwd, of course, doesn't directly tell you what it got, but you can use xv on
the resulting file and look at the same things as above.

It's my guess that xv and xwd are confused by the depth-16 display. What
type of visual that might be I don't know - the Windows display drivers I've
seen only list 24 or 32 bit as 'TrueColor'; 16 bit is listed as 'HighColor',
whatever that means. Whatever it is, most X servers (and client programs)
did not, until the advent of XFree, have a 16 bit colour mode.

Xvfb *does* support a 16-bit mode; when run in 16-bit TrueColour, xwd grabs
work just fine. I can't test what xv does for this case, since I can't
interact with Xvfb.

When I set the screen to 16-bit 'highcolour' with a free X server for
Windows (http://www.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/mix.htm), it reported
32-bit TrueColour to clients; when the screen was 8-bit, it reported a bunch
of visuals, including 8-bit PseudoColour and 8-bit TrueColour. This leads me
to suspect that 16-bit is a 'truecolour' mode (with about 5 for red, green
and blue).

Hmm, not familiar with this xhost thing.

That latter could be the cause. I'm using a binary distro (from where
I don't remember). Version 2.0.46.

Update:
Well, it seems to work now. Someone (Greg F?) mentioned autograb which
I know I've tried before. I was able to grab a few screens okay
so a full-screen grab only works with autograb in my case. A normal grab
with a single click on the background doesn't (individual windows/items
are no problem, however).
