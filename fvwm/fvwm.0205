I'm using FVWM 2.4.6.

Anyone know of a way to make FvwmPager not show the miniwindows
corresponding to sticky windows?  Just trying to remove some of the
clutter from my pager, and I couldn't find anything in the man pages or
FAQ about this.

FvwmPager man page:

       *FvwmPager: UseSkipList
              Tells FvwmPager to not show the  windows  that  are
              using the WindowListSkip style.

Setting the Style for the sticky windows to WindowListSkip
will cause the windows to not appear in the windowlist too.
This may be what you want.

I compiled fvwm 2.5.1 and now it feels as xmms's window is moving more
sluggish than before (2.5.0). I have OpaqueMoveSize unlimited.
But even setting OpaqueMoveSize 0 doesn't make any difference.
(and xmms does it's own window management).

Is this a common problem?

This seems to have been mostly fixed in the cvs version.

hmmm, but when I open the xmms playlist it is still pretty bad.

I am running fvwm 2.4.6 on Linux Debian (testing/Woody).  I have a few
keys defined to be available in any context:

Key F1 A M Popup PersonalMenu
Key F5 A SC GoToPage 0 0
Key F6 A SC GoToPage 1 0
Key F7 A SC GoToPage 2 0

Key F9 A SC Exec Eterm -g 90x50 -f white -P ~/pixmap/bhbkg.jpg@:tiled


I also have a Buttonbar defined.  So far it only has a clock and the pager in
it.  If it has xclock in it, the above keys work fine.

*FvwmButtons: (Swallow XClock `Exec exec xclock -update 1 -padding 1`)

If it has either dclock or asclock in it, the above global keys have no effect
- until another application has been opened.  After another application is
open the keys again work fine.  Even after the other application is closed.
The keys still work fine.

*FvwmButtons: (2x1, Swallow DClock `Exec exec dclock  -slope 90 -bg black -led_off black`)
or
*FvwmButtons: (Swallow asclock `Exec exec asclock -12 -shape -geometry +3+3`)

The only thing I can think of is that maybe dclock and asclock accept input
and xclock doesn't.  But I don't see what to do about it.  By the way, this
didn't happen with an earlier version of fvwm that I'm running at home (2.4.3
I think).

I can post my entire rc file if that would be helpful, but, as you may know,
Debian has a standard setup for fvwm that provides hooks for users to fill in.
So if you want to see the whole setup, you'll get a lot of stuff.  I've gotta
figure it's in this area though since the problem goes away if I use xclock
instead of dclock.

Any suggestions?

WindowMaker dockapps are programs drawing into their 64x64 window.
Any properly written X program should work nicely in FVWM. The problem is
that some dockapps are not written properly as regular X applications.
But most of docapps in http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp/ should work ok:

The best solution is to fix this program. Some time ago Dominik patched
wmfishtank to be more standard (support window manager delete protocol,
set hints correctly and draw to both normal window and icon window
depending on state, not only to one window depending on switch), but it
seems that the author did not release the corrected version...

Just to be sure. Do you have "I" before "Wait"? It can't work without it.
Also please take a look at the standard error stream, it may contain
messages about this app.

If you specify a geometry of the FvwmButtons button, then yes, this app is
resized automatically.

I'm an olf fvwm user but I just switch distributions to Debian.
Having done so, I can't find a deb for fvwm-themes-base and
fvwm-themes-extra.  Are these to be found or do iI have to compile
from source?

Thanks,

Is this the right place to report a bug?

I'm running fvwm 2.4.6 on Debian (testing/Woody).

Given the following entries:

*FvwmButtons: Geometry +0-0
*FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 32x32

I would expect to get buttons sized 32x32 and the button bar to be in the
lower left corner.  This does not happen.  The button bar is in the upper
left corner.  I have to change ButtonGeometry to


*FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 32x32+0-0

to get the buttons in the lower left corner.  From the documentation, I would
have expected this.

Is anyone in a position to report about how long it took to build
FVWM under cygwin, along with CPU type/speed and memory size?  I'm
figuring to take a stab at it (on a 120MHz P5, 24MB, Win95), and
would like to come up with a rough idea of how long it's likely to
take.

Noone builds Debian packages of fvwm-themes, so unless some Debian user
wants to do this for all others, you should install it from sources.

I am not sure this is bug. ButtonGeometry, if specified, fully overwrites
Geometry, and 32x32 is considered to be 32x32+0+0.

The documentation says a standard X11 window geometry should be specified
for both options, it does not say that part of the geometry is taken from
Geometry option and part from ButtonGeometry option.

Mikhael.

You may try "Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus", "Style asclock NeverFocus",
but I can't reproduce any problem myself with 2.4.x.

You may also try 2.5.1 and create minimal-rc showing the problem, put it
~/.in fvwm and run "fvwm -f minimal-rc".

Yes, I think it is correct. I've applied the patch to the current
cvs and I will apply it soon to the stable branch.

OK, here's a minimal .fvwm2rc that shows the problem.  Start fvwm 2.4.6 (at
least that's what I have) with the following .fvwm2rc.  Notice that pressing
Control-Shift-F9 does _not_ result in a beep.  Now open up any other x app.
Now CSF9 does result in a beep.

You should be able to reproduce this as long as you've got xcalc.  If you
don't, try substituting any other common X app that accepts input.

Commenting any of CirculateSkip or ClickToFocus or the xcalc swallow will
result in the key working properly.  Seems to be an odd interaction amongst
them all.

I have no idea what CirculateSkip does.  Its behavior is not documented in the
fvwm man.  The Debian maintainer has it in the standard Debian setup - which
is how I ended up with it.

I am encountering the following peculiar problem.  I use the "MiniButtons" and
use one of them to start Matlab using

*MiniButtons -   matlab32c_icon.xpm   Exec exec matlab

When I do this I have the unfortunate effect that using control-c at the
Matlab command line, which should stop the currently executing Matlab command,
kills the X server and all programs running under X.

If instead I use

*MiniButtons -   matlab32c_icon.xpm   Exec exec xterm -e matlab

everything works fine, except of course I have an extra xterm hanging around.

The same behavior occurs if I invoke matlab from a menu.

The people at Mathworks (home of Matlab) are trying to reproduce and then
understand this problem, but so far there has been no success.  Does this ring
a bell with any of you?

  Ouch.  Thanks for pointing that out.  Here's what I have now...

DestroyFunc Mixer
AddToFunc   Mixer
+ I Exec /usr/GNUstep/Apps/Mixer.app/Mixer -1 VOLUME -2 PCM -3 CD
+ I Wait Mixer.app
+ I All (Mixer.app) Raise
+ I All (Mixer.app) Resize 6 7
+ I All (Mixer.app) Mouse 0 3 A Destroy

  It works as far as sizing is concerned.  BTW, what's the command (if
any) to rename a window ?  I may want to call up separate invocations
for the CD and the sound card.  The "Resize 6 7" is because the window
seems to treat the parameters as characters rather than pixels.  The
only remaining thing I need is to set up an extra button *ONLY* on the
mixer title bar.  My current setup adds a button 3 to all windows.  I
tried to figure out how to set up a style that applies to only a
specific window, but I can't get it to work.

Hi,

I have compiled FVWM on my HPUX 10.20 workstation with the gcc
compiler. It works but starts up with two nasty white lines across the
screen. It seems they some sort of limit, because the icon box for the
virtual desktops is orientating itself along those lines. 

The lines are about 3 quarters across the screen from the left and a
quarter of the screen above the lower screen boundary.

Can someone give me a hint what the reason might be?

Best regards,

Sebastian

I think this will do it (after you define what button 3 does):

Style * NoButton 3		# turn off button 3 for all windows
Style Mixer.app Button 3	# turn ON button 3 for Mixer.app

I think this will do it (after defineing what button 3 does):

Style * NoButton 3		# turn off button 3 for all windows
Style Mixer.app Button 3	# turn ON button 3 just for Mixer.app

Yes, you compile fvwm with --enable-xinerama-emulation as option
to ./configure. You must not, this option is for developers only
for testing.

Thanks a lot Olivier. 

Your suggestion did the trick. The only
interesting thing is the configure script actually found no
libxinerama and therefore I believed it wouldn't use it. But it must
have. After disabling xinerama with the --disable flag it worked fine.

Best regards,

Sebastian

Strange.  What fvwm version is this?  Does any of the programs
leave a core dump on the disk?

No, it's called 'emulation' because it's intended for developers
without a Xinerama system.  The white lines mark the boundaries of
the emulated screens.

When having all desks crouded with windows it can be hard to see easily
which desk is active if a very small window is active (the one with a
distinct colour). (Because the background is hardly visible).

My suggestion is to have an option that adds a thin border (which can be
given a colour that "stands out") around the active desk (or page) in the
pager.

I am having problems with my hotkeys and focusstyle changing at random
times while using my sunpci card under Solaris 8 fvwm 2.4.7.  I go for a
time using the keys, and they work, but there are some times that while
using the sunpci software the keys will just cease working.  What do I do?

Hi,

if I want to see the window list, e.g. with alt+tab, it is only
displayed as long as i press these keys. In older versions of fvwm2
it had been disblayed until esc or chossing one of the list items.
How can I get this behavior in fvwm2 2.3.31 (Suse 7.2 Linux)?

(At the moment I use `Key F1 A M WindowList'.)

Carsten

1. Check the FAQ.  I think its the first question.
2. Pay attention to the numlock key setting.

I hacked the pager on mine to keep windows off of a sliver of the bottom, so
that the root is always exposed, the root being a different color for the
active page.  It would be nice if windows in the active page/desk could be a
slightly different shade than the non-active pages/desks.

I also keep windows away from the side edges and thickened the border, so
that i can see the page boundaries easier.

Fvwm2 version 2.4.6.  No core files are created.  None of the log files show
anything odd.  Here are the messages from X:

XFree86 Version 4.2.0 / X Window System

As you can see the only thing odd is that the X connection is repeatedly
killed.  I have now found a problem with the use of control-c in Matlab when
it is started using a button in KDE, so I strongly suspect there is something
wrong in Matlab.

Some time ago someone asked if it's possible to get icons with
"boxes" around them.
And someone answered that if you turn off shaped support when running
./configure this effect will be achived.

But this prevents windows (like xeyes) from being transparent.
So I edited icons.c, replaceing all "FShapesSupported" with "0" to achive
this effect just on icons.

This works quite well. Though some icons still dont have a relief around
them. For example FvwmPager and TkDesk (client supplied).

I thought maybe this doesn't affect client supplied icons, but ymessenger
also has it's own icon, and it gets a relief.

What's the reason for this?
Is only transparant icons given this relief?

Below is the start of a quote from the fvwm2 man page.

BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS
       The following commands are built-in to fvwm:

            Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
            Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
            Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
            Key Escape A MC EscapeFunc
            Mouse 0 R N Menu MenuFvwmRoot
            Mouse 1 TS A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move
            Mouse 1 F  A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Resize
            AddToFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX I Raise
            + M $0
            + D Lower

Since I am attempting to understand one screen of the man page, before I
move on to the next (with an occasional resort to a search command), I
have so far failed in my attempt to locate the place where the codes:

R, A, M, N, TS, 0, 1, etc are defined.

Some of the meanings can readily be deduced from the subsequent
examples; others can not.  If a location exists where all the codes are
defined, what do I search for?

Those letters are arguments to the "Key" and "Mouse" commands.

The "Key" and "Mouse" commands are described under
"mouse, key and stroke bindings".

The R field in the Key and Mouse commands is the "context".
That's described in the Mouse command section.

              Context  describes  where
              the  binding  applies.   Valid contexts are 'R' for
              the root window...

Hello,

I have enabled the fvwm2 as windows 95 style window manager by using the 
Rebuild Sample 95 option.

My own Terminal emulation (TE) screen crashes, if I press Tab key twice. My 
Numlock key is On. If Numlock key is Off, the Tab key works fine.

I have set ClickToFocus Style. First Tab key press, lowers my window and 
next tab press kills my TE window.

Any thing I have to take care in the FvwmScript or in my TE code?. Can any 
one suggest me what to do?

Thanks in Advance.

L. Subbiah

Numbers on the last line are percents of the screen, I would rather use:

While others apparently have had no problems building FVWM under CygWin,
it's not working for me.  Configure claims aclocal and automake are
missing, even though they are in /bin and /bin is in the PATH.  It also
claims that gcc doesn't work.  How do I find out what it's doing wrong?

I'm on the list at another email address, but please Cc: this one :)

I suppose, there is nothing CygWin specific here.

You only need aclocal and automake for building from cvs sources.
You don't need them to build 2.4.7. Probably the reason ./configure does
not recognize them is that you have old versions, I don't know.

The gcc problem is fatal. Do you have working gcc? Try to compile and run
any hello-world program. Take a look at config.log, it should contain the
exact C program and compiler/linker flags that failed.

Mikhael.

That's strange. I have no Idea, why this could be so...

Damn... Sorry, I forgot to edit the adress...
Does anyone know, how to teach sylpheed to do that automatically ?

Nevertheless, I have a workaround: I disposed fvwm-2.4.6 and use 2.4.3.
No errors until now (two days)...

Hi !
Accidently replied to Dan, not to the mailinglist...

Begin forwarded message:

Hello,

I did nearly as you said. "Nearly", because my system doesn't know the
"whence" command, you mentioned. I suspect you meant "which" ?

So I did that:

Umm, and there's about the same problem when I detach GTK/Gnome button
bars. When I drag them using Gnome's handle, the window is far behind
the mouse arrow. Using my titlebar to move the window, or fvwm's Move
function, it works fine.

I am using today's CVS version.

Hi Folks!

I wanted to use different buttons for different window states
(maximized/shaded/sticky) using ToggledActiveUp and so on. I first tried
my own config using pixmaps, but it didn't work. It looked like this:

AddToDecor MyDecor
+ ButtonStyle 3 Pixmap button_brushed_active.xpm
+ ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp Pixmap button_brushed_pressed.xpm
+ ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown Pixmap button_brushed_pressed.xpm
+ ButtonStyle 3 ToggledInActive Pixmap button_brushed_pressed.xpm
+ ButtonStyle 3 - MwmDecorStick

Mouse 1 3 A Stick

But it didn't work. Then, I tried the example from the manpage, but it
was the same: Just no reaction (except the titlebar changing).

Any hints on this? Google found nothing related to this topic.

TIA & HAND
Andr

Hello Mr. Anderson,

I have tired the IgnoreModifiers option. Still the problem is coming.
Now I have changed my settings to

Style * SloppyFocus
Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

Still the problem is coming.

I want to use the Numlock state also. So I cannot disable the Numlock using 
xmodmap. What could be problem?.

I can't see anything wrong with that. Have you used:

Style * UseDecor MyDecor

If you want all windows to have the same decorations you could
use for example:
 
...
ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp          (Pixmap stick-activeup.xpm   -- Flat)\
              Activedown        (Pixmap stick-activedown.xpm -- Flat)\
              Inactive          (Pixmap stick-inactive.xpm   -- Flat)\
              ToggledActiveUp   (Pixmap stick-activedown.xpm -- Flat)\
              ToggledActiveDown (Pixmap stick-activedown.xpm -- Flat)\
              ToggledInactive   (Pixmap stick-inactive.xpm   -- Flat)

ButtonStyle 3 - MwmDecorStick
...

Works wonderfully in my .fvwm2rc.

The 2.5.1 fvwm.1 man page source file contains this text:

  Lines beginning with '#' are ignored by fvwm.  Lines starting with
  '*' are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather
  than configuration commands for fvwm itself). Like in shell
  scripts embedded newlines in a configuration file line can be
  quoted by preceding them with a backslash.  All lines linked in
  this fashion are treated as a single line.  The newline itself is
  ignored.

But GNU nroff and groff both seem to ignore lines starting with the
single quote character, so in the rendered man page the above text
appears like this (notice the 2nd line above is missing from the below
text):

       Lines beginning with  '#'  are  ignored  by  fvwm.   Lines
       starting   with   than  configuration  commands  for  fvwm
       itself). Like in shell scripts embedded newlines in a con-
       figuration  file line can be quoted by preceding them with
       a backslash.  All lines linked in this fashion are treated
       as a single line.  The newline itself is ignored.

I'm seeing this using Cygwin's man command, but I suspect this happens
on any system that uses GNU nroff (e.g., Linux).

The below patch fixes the problem on my Cygwin system, but I don't know
nroff well enough to say if this is the best way to fix it.

For this to work you should have:

  Style * MwmButtons  # button relief follows the state

Well, I was slightly to fast with my previous answer. It works, but it
doesn't work as it should. When the button is pressed, it uses the
pixmap, but not the background I defined in the Title. Please, see the
following two screenshots which shows an Xterm with the important part
of my RC. The second one shows the same window toggled.

That looks as if matlab does something that crashes the X server.
Should that be true, there may be a matlab bug involved, but it
definitely is an X server bug.  No matter what happens, the X
server must never crash (except when it runs out of resources).

Well, the problem is that title has no Toggle properties, only buttons,
your TitleStyle Toggled* lines have no effect (ToggledActive is even
incorrect).

So you should use another method to specify that a button has background
brashed_title_active.xpm and foreground button_brushed_active.xpm:

ButtonStyle 3 \
	ToggledActiveUp   Pixmap brashed_title_active.xpm
	ToggledActiveDown Pixmap brashed_title_active.xpm

AddButtonStyle 3 \
	ToggledActiveUp   Pixmap button_brushed_active.xpm
	ToggledActiveDown Pixmap button_brushed_active.xpm

I suggest to use the same AddButtonStyle method for non-toggled button
properties as well for consistency, instead of ButtonStyle. You may take a
look how it is done in fvwm-themes (any colors and buttons components).

I myself is not very happy that title has no Toggle properties (that would
not be really used, but passed to buttons with UseTitleStyle), I hope this
is improved in the future.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I have committed a patch that circumvents the problem, but I think
there are bugs in both, GTK and XMMS.  When fvwm gets a
ConfigureRequest from an application (for example when the
application moves its own window), fvwm looks for follow up
ConfigureRequests on the event queue that override previous ones.
In order to give applications a chance to generate these events, I
had a small pause at the beginning of the event handler that was
meant to allow the scheduler to run these applications:

  /* Free some CPU */
  usleep(1);

I don't know how it does that, but xmms seems to synchronize with
fvwm by waiting for the ConfigureNotify response and then issues
configure requests that have become obsolete already.  Normally,
fvwm would filter out multipe CR events, but during window motion,
it never has more than one on the queue at the same time.  I can
only guess that there is some very funny logic in GTK (XMMS is a
GTK application) that forces this performance hog situation.  It
probably has something to do with calling XSync() after
XMoveWindow().

Could someone report this to the GTK folks please?  With my patch
this is gone away, but it's no real fix because it will surely
break something with other types of applications.  To reproduce
the problem, the 2.5.1 release should do.

Bye

Applications can specify icon pixmaps or icon windows.  Fvwm
handles the transparency effect for pixmaps, but not for icon
windows.

Hi there.
I am using FVWM 2.5.2 (current CVS, as of 2002/05/06, but it happened
before too), and there seems to be a problem - when changing the fonts
in a running XTerm, i.e. with Shift + Keypad Plus (KP_Add), Shift +
Keypad Minus (KP_Subtract), or the Control + Right click menu, when
the font resizes, the geometry (that is - in characters - lines and
columns) of the XTerm also changes somewhat.

For example, with default XTerm (no custom X resources), it starts
80x24. If I then change the font to Large, the geometry changes to
120x27. When I then change the font to back to Default, the geometry
changes to 80x23 (not back to 80x24).

This happens only with CVS FVWM 2.5, it doesn't happen with FVWM
2.4.6, or with any other window manager, like TWM/MWM/Enlightenment.

No special FVWM configuration is needed to reproduce the problem - it
happens also with no .fvwm2rc at all.

Any idea what the problem might be?
It seems to me like a bug in CVS FVWM, as it does not happen with FVWM
2.4, or with other window managers, and it happens also without any
custom X resources (xrdb -remove) and without a custom FVWM
configuration.

  Any help/fix appreciated, thank you,

Hi, I am trying to get fvwm to work on Cygwin. I have encountered some
problems but the most annoying problem is the missing border in a child
window. I have a Java GUI application on the unix box that I want to
display to my NT (running Cygwin), the GUI application displays ok, but
when I select a menu item that brings up a popup child window, the title
border is missing so I can't dismiss this child window. Is there anything
I have to do in fvwm configuration to make it work properly?

Thanks in advance and pls cc your kind reply to my email as well.

So this means that those specifying a icon window will not get a relief
and those specifying a pixmap does get an icon relief (using my
modification)?

It's not really a bug in fvwm, but a combination of bugs in xterm
with a lack of functionality in X.  When an application changes
its font size, the window manager is informed that the font size
has changed, but not to which height and width.  So, fvwm looks up
that information on its own - but at the time it get to it, the
size may already have changed again.  For exampe:

 - Start with font width 9x15, window is 90 by 15 pixels (10x10)
 - App changes its font size to 10x18
 - App resizes its window to 100x180 (10x10)
 - App changes its font size to 12x24

If all requests are sent one by one to the X server and fvwm
processes them before the next is issued, the resulting window
will be 120x240 pixels (10x10).  If all requests are sent to the
X server before fvwm handles them, this happens:

 - Fvwm gets a PropertyNotify event indicating the font size has
   changed.
 - Fvwm reads the font size (12x24) and resizes the window to
   120x240 (10x10).
 - Fvwm reads the resize request and resizes the window to
   96x168 (8x7).
 - Fvwm ignores the next PropertyNotify event because the font
   size did not change.

It is impossible to prevent this reliably in fvwm, only the
application could do that.  But unfortunately the xterm
Programmers were not aware of this problem and issue a host of
font size changes and window size changes in a single batch
without waiting for a reply from the window manager.  I have
changed the part of the logic in fvwm that surfaced this
particular bug at the cost of similar problems in other
applications.  Maybe I'll rewrite that stuff so that it can
be set individually for each window.

Uhmm... That sounds weird... Both since that problem is new in the
FVWM 2.5 CVS code (didn't exist in FVWM 2.4), and it doesn't happen in
other window managers...

Uh... Well, I didn't even know that applications notify X that their
font size has changed... I thought only the general (pixel-based, and
geometry) size is reported... But well, the size of the window isn't
exactly the font's size multiplied by the geometry... There can be
other widgets not counted, for example... Take For example XTerm and
Emacs, both with the same font size, both with the same geometry, the
pixel size of the window is different...
I thought that the geometry's meaning is defined by the application,
so the application, given a geometry, decides on the window's size by
itself, and reports that to X...

Uh... well, but in my example, there is only one font change... so why
does it really matter? The font size changes only once, and while FVWM
is informed on it, there are no further size changes...

> It is impossible to prevent this reliably in fvwm, only the

So why does it only happen in CVS versions of FVWM 2.5? It does not
happen in FVWM 2.4, TWM, CTWM, MWM, Enlightenment, etc... There must
be something in FVWM too...

But how does this matter if the size changes only once?

What do you mean by that?

Isn't it possible to just do it the way FVWM 2.4 did it?

Yup.  I've tried to implement that feature a while ago, but got
confused with all the icon hints stuff we have now and gave up
for the moment.

I think implemented this is not so difficult, in fact the icon
hints are not really important here, the icons is build from
the icon info contained in the FvwmWindow struct and these
info which depends on hints should be (is?) initialized before
we build the displayed icon.
When I implemented alpha blending for png/ewmh icons I've
implemented the feature (in an hard codeded way) and remove
it because it seems to me that this feature need a bunch
of new styles and I was a bit lazy to ask how this new feature
should work at the user level.

So we should add new style(s). I suggest to force the use of
colorset, so we need at least IconBackgroundColorset. Now maybe
we need also an IconHilightColorset ?
After that we should decide if the user can decide how the
icon is displayed into the background and if we allows icon
resizing. It seems that this feature come with an other one:
put the icon into a _fixed_ size background. This leads to
others styles: "IconBackgroundSize width height" and
"IconMaxSize width height [wanted_width wanted_height]"
(if icon_width > width || icon_height > height, resize the
icon to width x height [wanted_width x wanted_height]).
Then, we should add a MiniIconMaxSize style and menu style
(because I need it :o).
I _personally_ do not care so much about all these new
icon styles (as I do not use icons) but I will be happy to
implement these styles because it seems to me that having
these fixed size icons (with some bg) lead to better
usability.

HI

With this modification, does the icon get ordinary window decorations, 
or just a relief? Now the coding for tear-off menus is well on the way, 
could icons also be given ordinary window decorations?

No, it only gets a box with a shaded border and the icon pixmap in the
center.
The size still depends on the pixmap for example.
So there is more to be done to get "mwm-look".

Also see the post in reply to my last post (about adding new styles for
icons),

For me just a relief. I've no clear idea about adding ordinary window
decorations to icon.

That's because I cleaned up the code that deals with applications
resizing their windows.  I had to make a choice if font size
changes should be done immediately or upon the last notification.
I chose the latter, and that beoke xterm.

In addition to the font size, applications can define a base size
that is added.  The base size is usually the space needed for
scrollbars, menu bars, tool bars etc.  These are different for
different applications.

Um, *you* say that there is only one font size change.  This one
change would be enough to get the size right with a properly
working window manager.  But most window managers are totally
broken regarding font size changes (at least I've never seen one
that works fine), so xterm also resizes its window manually, and
then request the same font size change again twice:

 - Start with font size 9x15, 90x150 pixels
 - Xterm requests font size 10x16
 - Xterm requests window size 100x160
 - Xterm requests font size 10x16
 - Xterm requests font size 10x16

There's ample opportunity to screw up the geometry.  Even worse,
you can't even blame the programmers of the individual
applications and/or window managers because the spec dealing with
window resizing is lousy and incomplete, hardly more than a pile
of junk.  It doesn't define the proper way to deal with this
problem.

See above.  It doesn't happen with other window managers because
they all ignore font size changes completely, as far as I know.
That xterm feature wouldn't work at all with such window managers
if xterm wouldn't ask for the new geometry explicitly.

Some test that is related you may want to try.  Start an xterm in
the bottom right corner:

  $ xterm -geom -0-0

Then increase the font size.  The window should grow towards the
top left corner of the screen, but with most window managers it
grows to the bottom right, off screen.

And another test that is almost unfair:  Start an xterm and
maximize it.  Then, change the font size.  Some window managers
fail in such a bizarre way that it's almost funny to watch.

That's roughly what I wanted to say.  Any solution I can think of
has a problem with certain applications.  I can only choose which
applications are broken.

Now, this problen is un-fixable in fvwm:  Start an xterm and hit
shift-+ and shift-- rapidly (faster than the changes can be
applied).  Wait a few seconds until things have settled down.  The
xterm ends up with a more or less random geometry.

Some windows screw up their geometry if the font size change is
applied immediately, and some break if you wait for the last
change before applying it.

Yes, the feature is not so difficult to implement, but I wanted to
clean up the unholy mess in the icon hints code.  It took me two
days before I gave up, unable to single out the icon hints from
the ewmh/gnome code :-/  Certainly, you remember my frustrated
mail back then ("hint code clean up" or something like this).
It's still one of my top priorities - not because the code were
badly written (it isn't), but because it has become so complex and
relies on so many implicit dependencies that it has well become
unmaintainable.

Hi, I was just wondering if it is possible to configure fvwm in such a
way that when I iconify an app, I /don't/ actually get an icon on the
desktop, but I am able to access the iconified apps via a menu?

TIA.

Andrew.

To suppress icons:

Style * NoIcon

You can still access apps using Alt-tab (Windowlist),
FvwmIconMan, FvwmIconBox, FvwmTaskBar.

Cuz that's the first snapshot where xview requested resizes wait till the
mouse enters a border area or calls up a menu....rather than happening
immediately.

BTW, i'm using clicktofocus

Running 2.4.5 on Solaris.

Occasionally I do some iterative trial-and-error things in my
StartFunction and/or InitFunction.  For the StartFunction, I
restart, and for the InitFunction, I launch (from an xterm) with the
-replace option.  If I do either of those things enough times (on
the order of a few dozen), eventually I get the error:

Xlib: connection to "<display>" refused by server
Xlib: Maximum number of clients reached
Error: Can't open display: <display>

and I have to log off and back on (to reset the X server).  Does
anyone know of a way to tell when the X server is approaching its
limit (or, for that matter, what the limit is)?  Is there a
workaround?

Install the latest Xsun patches and add "-clients 1024" to the Xsun

I've spent several unhappy hours trying to get any xview
application to resize itself but couldn't.  I *need* more detailed
instructions if anything is to be done about it.  Which
application(s) does the config file play a role?  Where do I have
to click at which time?

Sorry for the late reply.

No, it's not on the to do list.  It can't be done easily because
only the xor operation can be easily erased without causing all
windows below it to flicker.  If we'd draw the animation lines in
a specific colour, we'd have to erase the lines and cause the
windows below to redraw their windows.  That would make the
animation very unpleasant.

I don't think that's a related problem.  I'll get around to
checking this eventually.

Even if it looks like a classic if-else problem that is only easily
solvable in 2.5.x versions, it may be easily done in 2.4.x+ too due to
the way Module and functions in FVWM work:

  AddToFunc ToggleFvwmWinList
  + I None (FvwmWinList, CirculateHit) Module FvwmWinList
  + I Next (FvwmWinList, CirculateHit) Close

"Module FvwmWinList" is guaranteed to create a new window only after a
function is finished and "Next Close" is failed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

HI

I just updated from suse 7.2 to 8.0 and since the update, I 
have some trouble using fvwm2. After using fvwm2 for some 
time (1 hour?) I can't drag objects anymore (like windows or
scrollbars) When I try to drag such an object using the mouse, 
the object does not move, it just stays in one place. The
other features of fvwm doe seem to work normally.

best regards

jos

You may wish to upgrade to fvwm 2.4.7. The problem you describe may have
been fixed. Also, 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 sport much-improved window movement
routines over 2.4.5 and earlier releases of 2.4. You may be able to get
rpms from somewhere, I'm not sure. But, if you can't, compiling from
source is just something like:

download
copy to /usr/src
tar yxpvf fvwm-2.4.7.tar.bz2
cd fvwm-2.4.7
./configure
make
make install
be happy.

Though, you may want to uninstall 2.4.2 first.

Hope this helps.

Is it perhaps the obnoxious num-lock problem?  From the FAQ:

  0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse                  
       bindings stop working.  What can I do?                                     
                                                                                
  A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See           
     Q 5.5 for more details.

Hi,

I'm a fvwm2 2.4.7 user and I'm using it under sunOS 2.5 (sparc ULTRA 10)
I want to use my pixmap set to add to buttons, but I can't
add the specific paths to force fvwm search in.
I tried to add the following line  in my .fvwm2rc

ImagePath oldpath:+:my_path:+

where oldpath is the path given when I run fvwm-config with
the -I option, and my_path is my personal pixmap path.
I dont know how fvwm did to specifie the initial Imagepath ???

As this doesn't work I tried to put the new path in the
fvwm-config itself in the line 

fvwm_imagepath = oldpath:my_path

but without success.

when starting or restarting fvwm2 I got this message in my console:

[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from Letters

If somebody can help me ??

Best Regards.

No, the keybindings still work... It's only the dragging of 
objects that doesn't work anymore..

Btw, I installed 2.4.7 and sinced then, I didn't have the problem
anymore.

Is it perhaps the obnoxious num-lock problem?  From the FAQ:

  0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse

       bindings stop working.  What can I do?

Hi,
this is the config part of the fvwm-config file

Note that the initial path used by fvwm-config was

fvwm_imagepath="/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps"

And actualy the /usr/include/X11/pixmaps path doesn't existes, so why
did fvwm choose it ????

This is what our FAQ says (example from my config file):

7.12  Toggling windows on and off.                                              
                                                                                
   It is often desirable to have a menu item of perhaps a button in             
   FvwmButtons or FvwmWharf that launches an application when used              
   the first time and closes it if used a second time.  Although it             
   is not obvious how to do this, it is possible.  Let's assume you             
   need a menu item that toggles an FvwmConsole window on and off.              
   Then put the following lines in your .fvwm2rc:                               
                                                                                
     AddToFunc ToggleFvwmConsole                                                
     + I None (FvwmConsole) Module FvwmConsole                                  
     + I Next (CurrentPage Visible FvwmConsole) Close                           
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) MoveToDesk                                          
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) MoveToPage                                          
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) Raise                                               
                                                                                
     AddToMenu <some menu>                                                      
     + "toggle FvwmConsole" Function ToggleFvwmConsole                          
                                                                                
   Or if you prefer a button in the button bar:                                 
                                                                                
     *FvwmButtons(Action ToggleFvwmConsole)                                     
                                                                                
   The lines with MoveToDesk, MoveToPage and Raise will bring the               
   window to the top of the current page if it is not visible                   
   instead of closing it.                                                       
                                                                                
   If you want to toggle one specific window, e.g. an xterm, but                
   still want to have other xterms that are not toggled, you must               
   give the window an unique name:                                              
                                                                                
     AddToFunc ToggleXMessages                                                  
     + I None (XMessages) Exec ( TERM -T XMessages -n XMessages \               
         -e exec tail -f /var/adm/?* ~/.X.err )                                 
     + I Next (XMessages) Close                                                 
                                                                                
   Or for a toggling Netscape button:                                           
                                                                                
     AddToFunc ToggleNetscape                                                   
     + I None (Navigator) Exec exec netscape                                    
     + I All (Navigator) Close

Hi,
since my last e-mail I tried to do something with my problem.
The problem is not in the ImagePath commande itself since I could
specifie it, (Yes finally), but in the pixmaps.
My pixmap path is linked to my old (2.0.45) fvwm2 icons path.
When I try to put an *.xpm color file in a button that doesn't work
but when I put a monchrome icon (X11 bitmap) it works
in both buttons and menus.
Does the fvwm compilation failed or did I forgot somthing ??
Do I need an aditional library.
Jut wanna say that with my old version such line in .fvwm2rc
works without any problems.


*FvwmButtons - www.xpm Exec ""  netscape &

But in the 2.4.7 version it doesn't and without any error message.

Thanks for your help.

Don't change fvwm-config, it is not used by the fvwm executable itself.

Instead, specify: ./configure --with-imagepath=/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/softs/X11R6.3/include/X11/bitmaps:/softs/X11R6.3/include/X11/pixmaps

This path will then be built-in to both fvwm2 and fvwm-config.

You should add xpm support. See INSTALL.fvwm and FAQ, there are Solaris
specific issues.

This is a default, probably fvwm should try harder to set a good imagepath
default, but you may change it using ./configure anyway.

2.4.5 on Solaris (soon to be 2.4.7).  The more I discover about this
wm, the better I like it.

I configure with the --prefix option so I needn't be root to
install.  I also have the configuration I need, so I no longer
require "ConfigFvwmDefaults".  If I relocate the installation to a
different directory, I get a runtime error at startup telling me
ConfigFvwmDefaults couldn't be found.  Everything still works, so
the error is benign, but it would be nice if I could suppress the
message.  (I can work around it with a symlink from the old prefix
to the new location, but I'm hoping for a more elegant solution.)  I
also tried putting in a "dummy" ConfigFvwmDefaults in $HOME/.fvwm
and in the old prefix area (the two locations it told me it
searched) but it didn't help.  Any suggestions are appreciated.

The file ConfigFvwmDefaults is searched in the "old" place, run
`fvwm-config --fvwm-datadir` to find which exactly.

But please don't relocate instalation manually, this is a source of hidden
problems. The only supported relocation method is, like with any non
trivial program, reinstallation using different ./configure arguments.
You should be using ModulePath that is not normally needed, because after
relocation fvwm can't find any module, not just ConfigFvwmDefaults.

You may think you don't need ConfigFvwmDefaults and never will. But, for
example, we added in 2.5.x several things to it, so that a user gets good
defaults for new features. I don't think you want to miss them. Just let
ConfigFvwmDefaults be what it was designed for, a read-only place where
developers place fail-safe-startup commands. Also, if you remove or change
this file, it is harder for developers to reproduce problems you may have.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just upgraded from 2.4.5 to 2.4.7 (Solaris).  I have TitleStyle's
set up to display HGradients for ActiveUp, ActiveDown and Inactive
windows (all with -- Flat).  The window titles seem to be repainting
themselves more than in 2.4.5, causing them to "flash" whenever
their window gains or loses focus; on a mouse button 1 down; and
ClickTime milliseconds after a mouse button 1 up.  The behavior -
especially the latter - is a bit disturbing.  Developers - what say
you?  Am I seeing things?

Hard to say.  THere were no drawing related patches in 2.4.6 or
2.4.7, so this should theoretically happen with 2.4.5 too.  Maybe
the machine is busy and drawing is slower?

The display is of the "load factor", which is more or less the
number of "runnable" processes.  This is not *exactly* the same
as CPU load, since CPU load cannot exceed 100%;  load factor has
no real upper limit.  Moreover, the graph's display is a time-average
over a sample interval. (Every time it scrolls is one interval).

Heh.  The genius of Unix.  This is probably because the programs
are IO bound.  I am currently compiling three kernels in parallel
on one machine, and its load factor is running around 5.5 to 6.
But the most top shows for any process is 2-3% cpu.  Compiling is
mostly IO work.  With good disks, you don't really notice a slow down
in things like keyboard response or process initialization.

(This discussion based on BSD, I dunno what Linux or Solaris do.)

When I want to see a high load factor, I simply fetch a bunch of mail
from a popserver.  The various sendmails are actually trivial tasks,
but they stay runnable for a long time doing dns lookups and so on.

> So if there is no obvious answer, please ignore.

For even more graphs, try fetching and installing xperfmon or
one of the other performance monitors.

Quite right; good catch.  To toggle between 2.4.5 and 2.4.7 quickly, I
put the latter on an NFS-mounted server.  The network latency was enough
to slow things down.  If I run it locally, things look good.  Thank you.

I'm using FVWM 2.5.1 under GNOME on Red Hat 7.2, and I have the
following two mouse binding commands in my .fvwm2rc file:

	Mouse 1	R N Popup RootMenu Nop
	Mouse 3	R N WindowList OnlyIcons, UseIconName

But mouse button 1 on the root window is handled by Gnome (for selecting
desktop icons), and mouse button 3 on the root window pops up the Gnome
desktop menu.  The FVWM commands shown above do not execute.  This
happens regardless of which modifiers I specify -- GNOME gets all mouse
1 and mouse 3 events.  I can bind mouse button 2 to an FVWM command
without a problem.

If I run FVWM without GNOME, I have no problem with those two bindings.

Is there way to get FVWM to handle those two mouse events?  I read the
man page, but found only the "GnomeButton" command which does the
opposite of what I want (it tells FVWM to let GNOME handle a mouse
event).

and HiBackColor to #000000... whats is the name for the unfocused
varibel? I have tried StdForeColor and StdBackColor, they didnt work...

Um ... you want to change the CONTENT color of the xterm? I suppose this
doesn't work, for fvwm only handles the borders and the title bar of an
xterm.

I have an Apple TiBook, and have set the trackpad to be used for 
clicks and drags. This means that a click-hold is a tap followed by a 
tap--and--hold-down--then--drag.

Problem is that if the tap-drag comes too quickly after the first 
tap, nothing happens (well, the title bar that I click in gets 
pressed). A click-hold just as fast with Aqua windows works as it 
should.

Double clicks work fine: I use

Mouse 0 T N MoveOrRaiseOrShade
AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseOrShade
+ C Raise
+ H Move
+ D WindowShade

Any idea how I can shorten this needed delay?

Oh, other question: DoubleClickTime is only listed as a menustyle 
option in the man page. Can I use it as a stand-alone command?

AddToFunc MoveOrRaiseOrShade
+ M Move

A double click delay for mouse bindings is the same as a single click
delay and controlled using the ClickTime command.

Which program handles your windows-like shortcut desktop icons?
I can't reproduce this with gmc-4.5.54 when no GnomeButton is specified,
i.e. FVWM gets every root mouse event.

I believe it is Nautilus under Red Hat 7.2 running GNOME.  Since I
posted my original problem report, I have discovered that if I launch
Nautilus, open its Preferences dialog, go to the "Windows & Desktop"
tab, and uncheck "Use Nautilus to draw the desktop", this problem goes
away.

I'm not sure this is an FVWM problem.  Nautilus appears to have been
"stealing" root mouse events.

I do not have gmc running.

Hi everybody,
Could someone tell me if it's possible
to change the bevel colors in FvwmWarf.
All what I can change is the background.
In the default drawig the buttons seem to
receive light from the upper left corner
and I would they seem to be lightened from
the right down corner.

I tried to use colorsets with "sh" and "hi"
but without success.

Thanks.

Interesting. That works, and is actually conceptually better. So what 
would be a legit application for click-hold?

We suggest to switch from FvwmWharf to FvwmButtons. FvwmWharf is basically
frozen, it works, but does not get new features like internationalization.

Still Colorset option works just fine in FvwmWharf, you may define
background using something like:

  FvwmTheme # run it if not yet
  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 50 HGradient 100 blue green, \
    bg rgb:B0/20/20, sh rgb:70/10/10, hi rgb:D0/40/40
  *FvwmWharf: Colorset 50

Or usually it is enough to just say "bg average", no "sh" and "hi" needed.
If you want to switch hi and sh, like you said, you may do this:

  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 50 SGradient 100 2 gray40 1 gray80 2 gray0, bg gray40
  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 50 shadow $[hilight.cs50], hilight $[shadow.cs50]

The first line creates "raised" relief, the second switches to "sunken".

Mikhael.

Granted, usually you should just duplicate "H" and "M" lines, but you may
for example give different Maximize parameters on them. Another usage is
to do something on click and cancel the click action by specifying Nop on
"M" or/and "H". I.e. if you clicked by a mistake, you may just hold the
button or drag it to cancel the action.

  DestroyFunc MyMaximize
  AddToFunc   MyMaximize
  + M Nop
  + H Maximize 0 95   
  + C Maximize 100 95
  + D Maximize 100 100

  DestroyFunc MyMoveOrDeleteOrDestroy
  AddToFunc   MyMoveOrDeleteOrDestroy
  + M Move
  + H Nop    
  + C Delete 
  + D Destroy

Also, you get a different feel on all these cases ("D" is like "C"):

  "M" specified
  "H" specified
  "C" specified
  "M" and "C" specified
  "H" and "C" specified
  "M" and "H" specified
  "M", "H" and "C" specified

Mikhael.

I just noticed something: with the latest (previous

the FvwmTaskbar disappears. (fvwm2 2.4.7 - Debian)

Do you use FvwmTaskBar with 

Style "FvwmTaskBar" StaysOnTop

? How about other programs which can switch to full screen mode like
acrobar reader or opera? Does the task disappear as well?

Hello,

There is no bugs in fvwm here (I think). If you check "Use Nautilus to
draw the desktop" Nautilus put a window onto the root window so there
is no more root window that you can click on, there is the desktop
window. With 2.5 you can try:

Mouse 1	D N Popup RootMenu Nop
Mouse 3	D N WindowList OnlyIcons, UseIconName

D is a new binding context for "desktop" (this may not work with
the Nautilus shipped with RedHet 7.2, but this work with a GNOME2
Nautilus which respect a certain protocole). However, if you (or
someone else) want that Nautilus manages the "desktop" I think you
want that Nautilus manages mouse buttons on the desktop window. So,
it is prefereable to use:

Mouse 1	D M Popup RootMenu Nop
Mouse 3	D M WindowList OnlyIcons, UseIconName

i.e., get your fvwm menus by adding a modifier (seems that
Alt+Mouse is not used by Nautilus neither by kdesktop (KDE
version >= 2)). Of course, the solution you use (removing
the desktop window) seems good too for me. I do not
understand the interset of these desktop window and desktop
icons :o)

I don't have Opera installed.
Acrobat Reader fullscreen still has the taskbar.
Taksbar has "StaysOnTop" Style.

I'm using FVWM 2.5.1, and I need a way to change the pixmap displayed on
one of the buttons in FvwmButtons.  I suppose I can do:

	DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*

and then rebuild the FvwmButtons configuration from scratch, and then do

	KillModule FvwmButtons
	Module FvwmButtons

But that seems excessive (not to mention likely to be visually
disturbing).

Does anyone know of a mechanism to change button pixmaps on the fly
within FvwmButtons?

When fvwm starts up, I can see the background being set, I see the
applications start up for the pager, and then they are swallowed by the
pager and somewhere along the way the banner pops up just before Fvwm is
done loading.

Is there some sort of support in fvwm to show a splash screen, wait for
fvwm to finish starting up, and then display the desktop?  (Would
FvwmBanner do something like this for me without using too large of an
image?)  This would hide the background stuff and make the startup look
better on my system.

I do exactly that in my modified awol theme for fvwm-themes but it's a
little complicated. You can grab my theme for an example from
http://awol.dyn.mpis.net/fvwm/testing/ft-modified-awol-0.6.x.tar.gz and
look at the awol/modules/main file therein and the section marked
"Modules menu functions". 
What it does is popup a different menu depending on which pixmap is
displayed, and a right click pops up a menu to change the pixmaps. It
needs to kill the FvwmButtons and start it again with the new pixmap,
but hey... It works for me!  :)

Well, in fvwm-2.5.1 it is possible, but not documented yet:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons Title <button-num> <new-title>

Numbering of <button-num> starts from 0. It also may be in +x+y form.
The syntax may be changed later. I would use a bit different syntax:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons Change <button-num> Title <new-title>

Because this syntax would be open for "Add" and "Delete" messages too.

You may dynamically change "Icon" too, just like "Title".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello Jos,

I've implemented shadow text (current fvwm CVS). Do you have any
idea about a default shadow colour? It should be computed from
the foreground colour and maybe the background colour. Do you
have a good formulae?

Check your .fvwm2rc file for and delete/close/destroy functions.
With Close and Destroy, applications are closed even if they
ignore the "DeleteWindow" message.

Is there a way to get new windows to show up at a position where the mouse
cursor is?
Like Style * SmartPlacement that overrides the position specified by the
program, but instead places the window at the cursor position.

If galeon places itself above FvwmTaskBar (and thus above every other
window too), having FvwmTaskBar on top will not help you. Alt-Tab will.
Anyway try:

  Style FvwmTaskBar Layer 12

or:

  Style galeon* GNOMEIgnoreHints

This is not yet possible, but it is mentioned in todo-3.0 file.

HI

I just tried the last snapshot of fvwm and I think it's great!
Particularly, I like the tearoff menus. I like to use
this for easlily trying different color schemes. In my setup
I have a menu which is built from a directory containing a number
of color scheme files. Clicking on the menu then instantly applies
color scheme to fvwm and all gtk applications. Without tearoff
menus, one needs to walk through a tree of menus for each 
scheme to try. But with a tearoff menu, one can just click a number
of them, a bit like when using a dialog box. 

A problem with this
however, arises when the number of entries in the menu gets large.
One then gets a 'more' entry on the bottom of the menu. I wondered
if it is possible to use scrollbars in this case, instead of the 'more'
menu at the bottom, so that one can scroll through all menu items.
 I tried FvwmScroll, but that doesn't work: the menu entries dissapear
as soon as I applied FvwmScroll to the torn of menu window. Is there
a way to apply scroll-bars to a torn of menu that has too many items
to display at once? 

best regards

HI Olivier,

I think it's great that you implemented the shadowed title
text. I just downloaded the latest fvwm snapshot, and would
like to try this new feature. How can I switch this on?

I made a patch and put up a web page (patch included).
http://fries.net/~david/fvwm/

I noticed that a good number of the programs out there list the name
of the program as the last word on their title.  I wanted a way to
group programs in the WindowList.  The Alphabetic option to WindowList
can't do this since it always starts at the beginning of the title, so
I added an option SortLastWord which when used with the Alphabetic
option will sort the entries based on the last word and then start at
the front if the last word matches. =20

The patch is applied against today's fvwm CVS tree.  I do have a
couple questions.  I used the variable pscratch in the WindowList, but
I wasn't sure if I had to do anything special becides freeing the
memory before I exited, or do I need to zero it last?

What's the difference between safemalloc and malloc and do I need to
check to see if it succeeded?

Does it sound reasonable to require Alphabetic to use SortLastWord?

If someone could answer my questions I'll attack the gtk version as
well as the fvwm man page and then submit it again.

Ok, so I really didn't need any dynamic memory.  Everything else still
applies, comments?

Well, you may already separate applications (and sorts them) depending on
their patterns using FvwmIconMan. See also FvwmIconMan Transient option.

Another note, other WindowList boolean options don't have their opposites,
so NotSortLastWord (a better name is SortLastWordOff) is not needed.

It is better to avoid hacks, but it seems that pscratch usage is ok here.

This is a difference, you don't need to check its status.

> Does it sound reasonable to require Alphabetic to use SortLastWord?

Not to me. Most of programs (all that I use) don't put their name at the
end, some put it at the beginning. This would break Alphabetic completely.

If you mean FvwmGtk, it is currently broken in cvs, but there is also
FvwmWinList. :-)

Post new patches to fvwm-workers. Quoting old patches is not needed.

HI

I just found in the mail archive how to make text shadowed.
It looks great! As for calculating the color, in my setup 
I use the 'selection' color from the motif color calculations.
This one is a bit lighter than the 'shadow' color. 

A problem with drawing a shadow behind text, is that it only 
looks good when the shadow can be made darker than the color 
of the actual text. Eg if the text color is black, the fgsh
maybe should be set to the background color so that effectively
no shadow appears. Otherwise, one gets an ugly doubely drawn
text, in almost the same color. 

Furthermore, I also tried to use the feature in the pager, for 
the desklabels. (Like is done in CDE) This hoever, doesn't seem
to work (yet?).

best regards 

jos

Well, if you read the thread fully, I suggested an algorithm that gives
a non-ugly shadow color, including the black text case.

What exactly does not work for you? Try "DesktopName 0 new-name" in
FvwmConsole and you should see a new name appearing in a pager.

I run fvwm 2.5.1
My pager always has the window title "Desk 0", regardless of desk.
(the pager is stucky).
But the icon title changes depending on the desk.

Before the title was always "FvwmPager", but I like the idea to have the
title reflect the current desk.
Is this a behaviour that is changing in the beta version?

The relevant part of the config looks like this (generated by a script):

*FvwmPager: Font none
*FvwmPager: Geometry +0+0
*FvwmPager: DeskTopScale 24
*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap 0 /home/marcus/.fvwm/backdrops/0
*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap 1 /home/marcus/.fvwm/backdrops/1
*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap 2 /home/marcus/.fvwm/backdrops/2
*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap 3 /home/marcus/.fvwm/backdrops/3
*FvwmPager: NoDeskHilight
*FvwmPager: SmallFont 5x8
*FvwmPager: Balloons
*FvwmPager: BalloonFore black
*FvwmPager: BalloonBack rgb:ff/ff/9c

This bahaviour was not changed in 2.5.x.

But you may have any title you want, even change it dynamically:

  DesktopName 0 "<0>"

This configuration does not affect FvwmPager labels.

I think you launch FvwmPager without arguments and it defaults to "0 0",
i.e. shows one Desk 0. Run it as "FvwmPager * *" instead if you want it
to show the current desk.

I once wanted to change the default to "* *", but Dominik argued some
folks may depend on the current default. Hmm, just tested, FvwmPager in
2.2.x does not have any default, it refuses to start without 2 arguments.
I think I will change the default to the everyone's benefit.

Mikhael.

No, I launch it as "Module FvwmPager 0 3"
The pager has 4 desks.
I was just wondering why the icon name changes, but not the window title.

At present time the feature is only implemented in fvwm, FvwmIdent
and FvwmTaskBar. It will be present in all modules (but FvwmGtk and
maybe FvwmWharf) in a few days.

The title on the pager is a minor thing that I have wanted to change, so I was
happy to see this.  But when I tried it I got an error that there is no such
function.  And quickly grepping around in the source I didn't find DesktopName
or any trivial variation.  Is that the right name?

I think you can use FvwmBanner to do this
In InitFunction (or StartFunction if you want to show this for restarts
also).

AddToFunc InitFunction I Module FvwmBanner
....	# some other initialisation here...
+	I	KillModule FvwmBanner

Then you need to configure FvwmBanner to show a fullscreen picture and
have a longer time out than the default 3 seconds.

*FvwmBanner: Pixmap	<your pixmap>
*FvwmBanner: TimeOut	10	# wait for 10 s (replace 10 if too short)
*FvwmBanner: NoDecor		# turn off window decorations

I sort my windowlist by class before sorting by name.
I also print that class.

All user visible changes in FVWM are listed at this url:

  http://fvwm.org/generated/NEWS.html

As you may see, DesktopName was added in 2.5.0 (man fvwm).

You may change labels in 2.4.x or 2.2.x too, just not dynamically.
Search for Label option in the FvwmPager man page.

Mikhael.

Hello again.  Two small questions.

Firstly, I'm using this setup,

    mouse   1       w       m       function alt-move

    destroyfunc     alt-move
    addtofunc       alt-move
    +               m       move

which allows me to move a window by clicking and dragging from anywhere
within it, using alt.  However, it only works for focused windows (I'm
using clicktofocus, obviously).  Any way I can make it either focus the
window first, or make it work for non-focused ones?

Secondly, I tend to alt-tab alot, and sometimes I do so while moving the
mouse around.  This leads to disaster. :-)  I suppose there's no way
around this, but I thought I'd mention it...

Elliot, you always mention that you run a patched windowlist.
If that or another feature is so useful to you, why not to think about
its generalization and adding it as an option? Then submit a patch
against the cvs sources, including ChangeLog, fvwm.1 and NEWS changes.
And keep convincing developers that your patch should be applied. :)

Actually sorting by a class or a resource sounds more appealing to me
than sorting by the last word in the name. This is more correct.

Mikhael.

I can confirm this.
I thought disaster was that fvwm crashed until I tried this myself (and I
use SloppyFocus). This crashes my machine...
I would think this is a serious bug.

Wow.  I just meant that I don't get to the window I wanted. :-D

I can only suggest:

  Style * ClickToFocusPassesClickOff

This should solve your problem, but I am not sure this is what you want.
If a click on ClickToFocus window is passed to an application, unexpected
things may happen. Maybe Dominik may explain this better.

Please always mention your version. And exact bindings if not default.

What is exactly the thing that there's no way around it?

Yes. This problem was fixed a day or two after 2.5.1.
Use the stable version or the latest snapshot if you tend to move a
mouse a lot when using a keyboard, i.e. Alt-Tab. :)

Mikhael.

That gets close, but doesn't really do all the things
Stephen asked for.

To suppress the desktop,
there used to be a -blackout commmand line option that
just blacked out the display during startup, but that was
removed.  That didn't allow for a splash screen though.

FvwmEvent gets a message at "end_config_info" perhaps that
could be used instead of a timeout to remove the splash screen.

To hide the desktop, perhaps you could find a program that created
a full screen window and put that window in the top layer.

This does indeed solve it, but you're also right in that I don't want
it. :)  It seems sort of illogical to me that the w context does not
trigger on unfocused windows, but perhaps there should be a separate
context for it?

Sorry, I didn't think it important.  What I meant was that alt-tab warps
the mouse pointer to the windowlist, and uses it in the selecting.  This
is what I assumed there is no way around.  Moving the mouse while doing
this causes it to skew off its course.  I'm running 2.4.6 with some
patches (currentatend, iconifiedatend).

    key     tab     a       m       windowlist root c c currentdesk, nogeometry, currentatend, iconifiedatend

You probably mean applications swallowed by FvwmButtons, not a pager.
You may specify a geometry for such applications that is out of the
screen. Search for "-geometry" in the FvwmButtons man page.

You may add such splash yourself if you want. Here is an idea for 2.4.x.
Add these lines as the first lines of your .fvwm2rc:

  Style MySplash NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, Layer 12
  Exec exec xeyes -name MySplash -fg rgb:88/77/55 -bg rgb:55/44/33 -outline rgb:aa/a0/80 -center rgb:ef/d8/90 +shape -g $[vp.width]x$[vp.height]+0+0

And these lines as the last lines of your .fvwm2rc:

  AddToFunc InitFunction I All (MySplash) Close
  AddToFunc RestartFunction I All (MySplash) Close

I wouldn't want to see the class name, but sorting by class does sound
better except it wouldn't distinguish between a terminal and the
terminal running vim which you could by my method.

Please do include a patch.

I don't think there is a case that is handled better by the last word.

vim does not change a terminal name, and it is correct, because a terminal
that runs a shell is not limited to vim, a user may always Ctrl-Z from it.
And terminals running vim rather than shell are already sorted together.
A new class may be created if needed, "xterm -name VIM -e vim file_name".

I think it is a bug that with unfocussed ClickToFocus window a click is
passed to app and only then the "w" binding is checked, while with
focussed ClickToFocus window the "w" binding is checked before passing a
click (i.e. it is not passed).

So when a click is passed (window is not focussed) application eats this
click, FVWM only sees a mouse release.

For "m" in your function to work, FVWM should see a press, not a release.

But you may work around this bug, just change "m" to "i" in your function.

Please define the behaviour you want to have.

If you don't want WindowList to warp the mouse pointer, remove "root"
option. If you don't want WindowList to be activated on Alt, add
"SelectOnRelease" option or press right-Alt-Tab.

Or maybe you need a new option "DontActivateWindowListWhenMouseIsMoved"?
Define what "MouseIsMoved" means. Moved by more than 5 pixels in 3 seconds
after Alt is pressed? :)

Mikhael.

That is not at all the same...  I want to drag the window, not have it

I see I've not made myself clear.  The point I'm trying to make is that
the alt-tab use of windowlist should be independent of the mouse
pointer, not warping the pointer to the windowlist, or necessarily
having the windowlist pop up under the pointer.  I do alt-tab quickly to
get from one window to the next, but if I'm moving the mouse while this
happens, the pointer ends up in the wrong place in the windowlist before
I release alt, bringing me to some other window than the one I was going
for.  I'm not sure I can explain this any better. :)  The option I would
want is something like DontUseTheMousePointerInWindowListAtAll. :)

Is there a way to get a window decor button that is tied to a menu to not
remain pressed in when the mouse button is released, althogh the menu is
still posted? (this is the way it behaves in mwm)
Maybe this should be implied by Style MWMButtons

With 2.5.1 (only) replace the line:

  Mouse 1 1 A Menu WindowOps Delete

with:

  Mouse 1 1 A Schedule 0 Menu WindowOps Delete

Thank you.
But there are some problems with this.
The menu doesn't appear until the mouse button is released and when
selecting an entry in the menu it's operation are not directly applied to
the window in question, instead the pointer changes to a crosshair to
select a window for the operation >

When a menu is activated, no buttons may be pressed/depressed.
So a menu button should be depressed either before a menu started or
after it is closed.

I would suggest:

  Mouse 1 1 A Schedule 0 WindowId $w Menu WindowOps Delete

but this only makes Delete work, not a menu.
I think you can't run an arbitrary menu in a window context.

So currently what you want seems impossible to me. The behaviour where the
menu button is pressed on a menu popup is not bad, you may get used to it.
Also some people may like Popup instead of Menu (don't add Delete here):

  Mouse 1 1 A Popup WindowOps

I tried using a function with different actions for click, hold and
double-click with som variations using Schedule, but I didn't get it to
work that way.
So I guess it's not possible.

With sloppy focus some windows doesn't take focus (like xclock).
By turning on Style * Lenience this is overriden, but not for fvwm
tear-off menus.
I know most people prefer not to have windows that you don't type in
"steal" focus, but I prefer to have them change to focused so I can
easier see where my pointer is.
Is there a way to get all windows accept focus?

It seems like several times a day I have trouble figuring out where
the pointer has ended up, even when it's in a focused window.  It
would be really useful to have a button somewhere -- maybe one of
the otherwise-unused "window" or "menu" keys that sit between Ctrl
and Alt on newer keyboards -- which would cause the cursor to turn
into a big flashing blob for a couple of seconds.  Of course, I
have no idea how (or if) this could be done.

The way to make a decoration look focussed is like you said:

  Style fvwm_menu SloppyFocus, Lenience

But currently there is a problem with tear-off menus. Sometimes they are
drawn focused (Iconify, Deiconify or WindowShade), but usually are not.

Something like this:

  Key Super_L A A Exec xmessage -name "SmallBlob" -bg red -fg white -nearmouse -timeout 1 'I am here!'
  Style SmallBlob UsePPosition, NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 10

Try it, it's nice. :)

Hi,
I use ROX-Filer to get desktop icons in Fvwm. But the trouble is that the w=
indows appear below the layer on which the icons are so the icons are on th=
e top. How can I make ROX-Filer always start on the lowest layer? The appli=
cation name is rox. But in the process list, it shows up as ROX-Filer. whic=
h do I use to set the Style?

thanks
Rahul

I have 2 functions which I would like to change the binding of mouse
button 2 on the root window like this:

Mouse 2	R	A	HidePager

AddToFunc HidePager     "I"     All ("FvwmPager") Stick off
+                       "I"     All ("FvwmPager") MoveToDesk 123
+                      "I"     Mouse 2 R       A       ShowPager

AddToFunc ShowPager     "I"     All ("FvwmPager") Stick on
+                      "I"     Mouse 2 R       A       HidePager


So that pressing button 2 will toggle.
But this will not work, it seeems the last line tries to call the other
function, because the cursor changes to an hour-glass for about 1 second
(as if there's an infinity recursion that is interrupted).

Is it not possible to use the Mouse command in functions like this?
I didn't find anything about this in the man-page.

All you can do right now is to tear out the first half of the
menu, then enter the "More..." sub menu and tear it out too.  One
day I will implement better ways of displaying long menus.  When
that happens, tear off menus will benefit from the new feature(s)
along with normal menus.

Not at the moment.  When the tear off menu is unmapped, fvwm
destroys it immediately.  Tear off menus can not be swallowed in
FvwmButtons either.

Some versions of vim changed the terminal name to "Thanks for
flying vim".  Quite annoying.

You can reverse the button relief for that specific button when it
is pressed:

  buttonstyle 1 inactivedown (-- sunk)
  buttonstyle 1 activedown (-- sunk)

There is no way to make tear off menus behave like other
applications regarding focus.  All I can do is hack something in
so that menus get a 'focused' decoration when the pointer enters
them.

Put

I don't know how it exactly works internally, but you can not
expect that changing bindings or functions works inside complex
functions.  Anyway, there is a much simpler solution for what you
want to achieve.  Take a look at Q 7.12 from the FAQ:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.12  Toggling windows on and off.

   It is often desirable to have a menu item of perhaps a button in
   FvwmButtons or FvwmWharf that launches an application when used
   the first time and closes it if used a second time.  Although it
   is not obvious how to do this, it is possible.  Let's assume you
   need a menu item that toggles an FvwmConsole window on and off.
   Then put the following lines in your .fvwm2rc:

     AddToFunc ToggleFvwmConsole
     + I None (FvwmConsole) Module FvwmConsole
     + I Next (CurrentPage Visible FvwmConsole) Close
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) MoveToDesk
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) MoveToPage
     + I Next (FvwmConsole) Raise

     AddToMenu <some menu>
     + "toggle FvwmConsole" Function ToggleFvwmConsole

   Or if you prefer a button in the button bar:

     *FvwmButtons(Action ToggleFvwmConsole)

   The lines with MoveToDesk, MoveToPage and Raise will bring the
   window to the top of the current page if it is not visible
   instead of closing it.

   If you want to toggle one specific window, e.g. an xterm, but
   still want to have other xterms that are not toggled, you must
   give the window an unique name:

     AddToFunc ToggleXMessages
     + I None (XMessages) Exec ( TERM -T XMessages -n XMessages \
         -e exec tail -f /var/adm/?* ~/.X.err )
     + I Next (XMessages) Close

   Or for a toggling Netscape button:

     AddToFunc ToggleNetscape
     + I None (Navigator) Exec exec netscape
     + I All (Navigator) Close

   Keep in mind that these functions simply check if a window with
   the specified name exists.  They will happily close manually
   opened windows or launch an application multiple times if the
   application is slow to start (e.g. like netscape).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HI

Ok, maybe, for menus displaying the contents of a directory, 
it is better anyway to not use a menu, but a FvwmScript displaying
a file browser instead..

best regards

All you can do right now is to tear out the first half of the
menu, then enter the "More..." sub menu and tear it out too.  One
day I will implement better ways of displaying long menus.  When
that happens, tear off menus will benefit from the new feature(s)
along with normal menus.

Not at the moment.  When the tear off menu is unmapped, fvwm
destroys it immediately.  Tear off menus can not be swallowed in
FvwmButtons either.

I added a function like this:

AddToFunc TogglePager
+	I	None (FvwmPager) StartPager
+	I	All (FvwmPager) Close

(StartPager is another function used to start the pager (used also in the
init, it works...)

If the pager is not running, this function starts it. 
If it is running, it's closed and about a second or so later it starts
again.

I also wrote another function just to test, like this:

AddToFunc ToggleCalc
+	I	None (XCalc) Exec xcalc
+	I	All (XCalc) Close

it works as it should, toggling an xcalc.

Is the pager to slow to exit?

The FAQ examples are not quite universal, I will improve them.
Your function should be:

AddToFunc TogglePager
+     I       None (FvwmPager, CirculateHit) StartPager
+     I       Next (FvwmPager, CirculateHit) Close

Hello,

I am trying to get the fvwm2.4.6 do the alt-tab windowlist
thing, but I only want the "Current Page" windows to show
up.

I should say that the following line does what I want, with
a mouse-button:

   Mouse 3   R  A  WindowList [CurrentPage]

I've also tried the following, but it did not work for me:

   Key Tab   A    CMS  WindowList [CurrentPage]

this showed _all_ windows, not only the ones on the desk

So then, I went ahead, and removed Tab line from the key
mapping section, and it still works :( ? ... 

So, the question is 
a) Is there some sort of build-in Alt-Tab Windowlist
functionality?
b) How to make fvwm show only CurrentPage hits when pressing
alt-tab?

I know it either works on my laptop (can't check now), or
used to work on this machine, so I think I am missing
something simple.

thanks,

denis

Yes, its described in the man page under
"BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS".

The information in the man page should give you all the hints
you need.

Which version are you running?  What terminal?  I was trying to figure
out where they dropped that behavior, which is what the documentation
says should happen, but it isn't the case anymore.  If vim uses X it
can read the current title and reset it when you exit, if it uses
termcap it leaves the message you find annoying which you could set in
the config file if you wanted to.  You could even tell it not to
change the title.

I'm asking because when I ssh or telnet vim currently can't set the
title and I want it to.  My shell updates the title with the current
directory so I wouldn't have that problem.

Sorry, I can't remember, it's been years ago.  All I know is that
it came with some SuSE distribution and was version 4.6 or
earlier.

I can't reproduce this with 2.4.7 or 2.5.1. It works well.
Although a non-deprecated syntax is "WindowList (CurrentPage)".

Probably you have different configs on your machines.

OT:

I added the new syntax a long time ago, mainly because the syntax
description in the man page looks odd:

  WindowList [[options]]

It's not clear that the inner [] is to be taken literally.  I've
no intention of ever removing the braces from the syntax.

I forgot here that we already have CurrentPage condition (in brackets),
so CurrentPage option is not needed.

Here we have both CurrentDesk condition and option. I think the option is
here for historical reasons only, because all these lines are equivalent:

  WindowList CurrentDesk
  WindowList (CurrentDesk)
  WindowList (CurrentDesk) CurrentDesk

There is currently a mix between options and conditions. Options
  CurrentDesk, Desk d, Layer m [n], NoIcons/Icons/OnlyIcons,
  NoNormal/Normal/OnlyNormal, NoSticky/Sticky/OnlySticky,
  NoOnTop/OnTop/OnlyOnTop, NoOnBottom/OnBottom/OnlyOnBottom
could all be removed, we either already have corresponding window
conditions or such conditions may be added, like Desk and Layer.

Mikhael.

Hi all.

I'd customized .fvwm2rc, but now, when I hit F4 to show up WindowList,
the process list disappear when i release the key and next time it
appear in the upper left corner of the window focused. How can I freeze
the WindowList so i could choose any process?

Another question: how can I customize (eg: desktop #) the text of each
process in windowlist?

TIA and sorry for my english

Hi,

I mannaged to get fvwm to hang the X display today and thought maybe
someone out there might have an idea why.

Using fvwm2 version 2.4.7 I started gcalc.  There is a gutton next to the
"File, Edit, Help" Menu bar.  After left clicking on it, one can drag it
off into it's own window.

I noticed that it was slow in redrawing the area behind it after movement
and yanked it around kind of fast.  Needless to say, everything died.

Fvwm emitted this error:

[FVWM][PositiveWrite]: <<ERROR>> Failed to read descriptor from 'FvwmEvent':
- data available=N
- terminate signal=N

Does anyone have an idea what caused this, or can any one out there
reporduce it?

Thanks,

Tom

Hi!

I'm using fvwm under debian/woody from packages.

Now I cannot move windows outside from the screen. (expect xmms)
How can this behaviour changed?

I fire up xosview from init.hook
How to change this programs style?
If I wrote some styles into the post.hook or pre.hook files (which
should be processed BEFORE anything happens), I cannot change the
style. However if I open an xosview after fvwm has started, the style is
the one I'd like to be.
The same happens with FvwmPager.

So how to modify the style of those programs, which start at startup?

I assume you press Alt-F4 not F4 and WindowList disappears when you
release Alt. Add SelectOnRelease option with no parameter.

  Key F4 A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease

I am not sure what do you mean here. There are several options that affect
the menu item format and several options that affect the sorting. Try:

  WindowList Geometry
  WindowList NoGeometry
  WindowList NoGeometryWithInfo
  WindowList NoDeskNum, NoNumInDeskTitle
  WindowList NoCurrentDeskTitle, TitleForAllDesks

The options in the last two lines are only available in 2.5.x.
Please contact the man page for the description of WindowList options.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It's hard to say why this is happening without your config.  Can
you send the lines that are responsible for said behaviour, please?
Anyway,

  Key F4 A N WindowList

should do the trick.

> Another question: how can I customize (eg: desktop #) the text of each
> process in windowlist?

There are some options that modify the displayed string, e.g.
NoGeometry, NoGeometryWithInfo, NoDeskNum, NoNumInDeskTitle,
NoCurrentDeskTitle.

For example, use

  WindowList NoGeometry

to get the bare list of window names without any additional
information.  For more details, take a look at the man page.

Bye

HI

I thought I sent this mail yesterday, but it doesn't seem
to have appeared on the list. So please ignore if it 
appeared twice. 

In my fvwm setup I use a perl script that communicates
with fvwm via FvwmCommand. Now, I call the script on 
various occasions, for instance when the root-menu pops
up, to add some entries dynamically. This however makes
things a bit slow sometimes, because an executable has
to be started every time the root-menu pops up. 

I was wondering if it would speed up things a lot if
I'd program the setup script as an fvwm module. It would
also be nice if this could be programmed in perl. I 
stumbeled upon Module.pm. Is this meant to program fvwm 
modules in perl? I can't seem to find any documentation
or example modules unfortunately. 

best regards

jos

 HI

In my fvwm setup I use a perl script that interacts with fvwm
using FvwmCommand. For instance, when the root menu pops up, 
I use a perl script to insert some items dynamically, like an 
entry 'Close connection' that kills wvdial when it is running. Now, 
sometimes, especially when a lot of applications are running,
this makes popping up the root menu rather slow. 

So I was wondering if it is any faster when I'd convert 
the perl script into a fvwm module. 
I stumbeled upon Module.pm. Is this meant to write fvwm 
modules in perl? Unfortunately, I can't find the documentation
for this interface. Where can I find this?

best regards

Is there a setting to say "don't overlap the window with the focus"?

Mozilla really really annoys me. I insists on scattering its windows
across the screen, which is a major PITA when middle-clicking my way down
an index or suchlike, making several windows, inevitably overlapping my
mouse at some point and screwing things up. I have an FvwmEvent monitoring
script, which catchs the Mozilla windows and puts them where I want with
FvwmCommand, but there's still this (temporal) window of opportunity
with with several windows strikes regularly.

Can I preempt Mozilla's placement fetishism more effectively?

It says "(implied by -all)." on some options.
It's just that there are no "-all"...
So I guess it should say "-a"

It depends on the implementation. You may do it in many ways. Using
PipeRead, FvwmCommand, using FvwmPerl (3 ways: eval, load and preprocess).
Even if you decide to create your own module you may do it differently.

(1) A module that creates a menu after receiving a request message.
(2) A module that watches a network and updates a menu when needed.

In (1) you don't spend time on watching network, but spend time when
opening a menu. In (2) you open a menu immediately, but the module works.

Anyway, if you have a persistent module you don't spend time to create
processes and initiate pipes on every menu change, this is done once.

Documentation will be available once the perl library API is finalized.
For example, I want to add the colorset structure and more.

Currently see the source of FvwmPerl and 4 example modules in perl at:
  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/tests/perl/


--------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an implementation of your module using the method (1).

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Usage: run this module from StartFunction, then at any time execute:
#   SendToModule /path/to/MyMenuCreator create-menu

use lib `fvwm-config -p | tr -d '\n'`;
use FVWM::Module;

my $module = new FVWM::Module(
	Mask => M_STRING,
#	SyncMask => M_STRING,     # needed to process message synchronously
#	Name => "MyMenuCreator",  # needed for *MyMenuCreator: config value
#	EnableOptions => { q => sub { die "-q is not implemented yet" } },
);

$module->addHandler(M_STRING, sub {
	my $menuName = "MyRootMenu";
	$module->sendText("DestroyMenu $menuName");
	$module->sendText("AddToMenu   $menuName bla-bla Title");
	$module->sendText("+ 'Close connection' Exec killall wvdial")
		if grep "ppp0", `cat /proc/net/dev`;
});
$module->eventLoop;


--------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an implementation of your module using the method (2).

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use lib `fvwm-config -p | tr -d '\n'`;
use FVWM::Module;

my $module = new FVWM::Module;

local $SIG{ALRM} = \&checkNetwork;
alarm(10);  # check every 10 seconds

sub checkNetwork {
	if (grep "ppp0", `cat /proc/net/dev`) {
		my $menuName = "MyRootMenu";
		$module->sendText("Beep");
	}
	alarm(10);
}
$module->eventLoop;

HI

On the internet I stumbeled upon an example perl program,
implementing an fvwm module. This seems to be what I am 
looking for. The example worked fine on my system.

Now, I'd like to use 'SendToModule' to send strings to my 
module, so I tried to configure the perl program to read strings
as shown in the example below. When the module in the example
is started, it should send the configuration command
'style * notitle' to fvwm, when the program receives a 
string sent by fvwm through the command 

SendToModule FvwmTest astring

However, when I try this, nothing happens. What am I doing
wrong? 

Also I'd like to know, if there is some way to let the
module display a string somewhere, for debugging purpouses.

best regards,

jos





---------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use lib `fvwm-config -p | tr -d '\n'`;
use FVWM::Module;

my $stringHandler= sub {
	my $self = shift;
	my $type = shift;
	my @args = @_;

	$self->sendText("style * notitle");
};

my $module = new FVWM::Module(
	Name => "FvwmTest",
	Mask => M_STRING,
);

$module->addHandler(M_STRING, $stringHandler);
$module->eventLoop();

 HI

I think our messages must have crossed eachother. ;-)
Thanks for the example, I'll try it right away.
I'm looking forward to seeing more of your perl module!

Do you know you can get Mozilla to open new windows in tabs?

I don't normally like MIDI applications but in the case of the
browser, it seems like the best way to go.

| Do you know you can get Mozilla to open new windows in tabs?

Yes, but it's only useful to me about half the time (and my unconscious
keyboard habits know the "open new window" trick too well). For news
item windows the tabbed approach should work very nicely - I will be making
a conscious effort to use it more.

For other windows I want to deal with as standalone entities, either
for positioning purposes (eg to put then side by side) or for putting on
other desktops etc, it doesn't cut it. I already have fast and convenient
methods of window placement and arrangement mediated by FVWM, and using
a separate Mozilla-internal method for them seems ... clunky.

Also, Mozilla seems to want me to adopt a tabbed or new window approach
unilaterally. I would normally expect to use both. But I can't seem
to bind, say, middle-click to "new window" and something else equally
convenient such as "shift middle click" to "new tab". I must pick one or
the other and dig tediously through a menu popup for the the converse.
Other tools (fvwm, mutt, screen(?)) whih have key bindings let you attach
functions to arbirary things fairly easily. I gather such a mechanism
exists for Mozilla, but it's either ill documented or opaque. I have
yet to find a clear description of where to put such configs or what
functions one might attach to keys or mouse buttons.

Finally, I frequently create new Mozilla windows from the keyboard.
I have several tiny scripts which use netscape-remote to get mozilla
to open a window with a search result ("fm" for freshmeat, "google"
for google, etc) or more generally with an arbitrary URL. Of a morning I
routinely say "hi comics" which opens several comic pages at once and a
bit later "hi nerd" which opens some nerdly news channels like slashdot,
and so forth. In the current scheme I must wait for them all to pop up
(which is quite slow often) before I can do things. If they popped up
in the place I wanted (as my Netscape windows used to, for it does obey
its geometry settings) I could happily process email or something in my
shell window while it happened.

MIDI? I only know the electronic music acronym. What do you mean here?

Now, Mozilla is merely the most painful offender in this regard.
While I have taken some care to place new windows, and new terminals
always pop up in exactly the same place for me (which is what I want)
it would be quite handy for random apps to use SmartPlacement, but to
avoid overlapping the focus window as a priority, or perhaps the mouse
alone (in focus follows mouse mode, which would suffice to keep that
window usable, though visible is also desirable). I rarely have much
root window showing, so new windows usually must overlap something.

On reflection I suspect I should have taken this to fvwm-workers.

I'll get Moz1.0rc3 this morning and see if its tabbedness is more
flexible. Thanks for the suggestion,

Gee, I thought MIDI was the right term for applications that
managed subwindows themselves, like StarOffice 5.2 or Visual C++,
but I can't find anything to confirm that with Google.
I must be loosing my mind...

Its a pretty sure bet that everyone on fvwm-workers reads the fvwm
list too.

I'm avoiding addressing placement itself, mainly because Fvwm
has so many placement options I gave up trying to know what
they all do.

You seem to want to script and control the whole process.
If the windows have unique names, like the Slashdot one
will, you might consider using FvwmEvent to watch the window
being created and move it where you want.

It is MDI (Multiple Document Interface) as opposed to SDI (Single DI).

The problem here is that such script should return the final coordinates
before the window is mapped, not after.

If we would have such mechanism using module events, it is easy to code
a simple module in perl - FvwmPlacement - that implements all kinds of
placements and checks that a window is not out of screen and so on:

  UnderCursorPlacement  - should be done anyway
  CenterPlacement       - should be done anyway, because I need this :)
  AvoidFocusPlacement   - suggested by Cameron Simpson
  AvoidCursorPlacement  -   the same
  ConstantPlacement     -   the same
  and other placement policies per window...

Regards,
Mikhael.

It lets me open a tab on BOTH middle and control click, or NEITHER.
I want a way to open a tab or open a new window or open inline. Without
tedious menus. Still, that's for the Mozilla lists, not here. My concern
is placement of new windows.

In my first item I explained that I had written myself a tool to do this.
Works. But too slow. As I said, the new windows eventually appear over
my mouse, taking the focus (briefly, until they shift). And guess what
happens - my middle click, intended for the main index page I was using,
goes to the new window, which takes it as a request to go to the URL in
the cut buffer (typically not a URL at all).

The core issue is not that I can relocate these windows _once_ they
appear, but that in the gap between appearance and movement it's there
for real, and steals my focus, which is bad for the focused window and
the new window.

And, just thinking about this: Normal "smart placement", but make sure
the focus window stays above any new window. Hmm, ok for pointer based

the pointer is outside the focus window but over the new window?

HI

I managed to convert my setup script to a Perl based
fvwm module, and it works great. Popup menus that have
dynamically added entries in them, now pup up much faster.

At first I used the module to do the entire configuration 
of fvwm, but this turned out to be much slower than reading
the commands from a file. So now I only use the module for 
on-the-fly changes of single components, like the color scheme.
The first time fvwm starts up, I write all commands to a file
and read that.

best regards

jos

Yes, Read command is much faster (especially if there are thousand of
Style lines) than doing the same by sending one command after another,
because it does many updates only at the end unless there is UpdateStyles
command in the middle.

For such task it is better to use "FvwmPerl --preprocess fvwmrc.ppp" (when
I finish it) that will work just like FvwmCpp or FvwmM4, but embed perl.

Another solutions would be to use your module to write to a file and then
send one Read command. Or create a function from all these commands by
prepending "+ I " and then send a command to execute that function.
I didn't test this, but this should be much faster than sending thousand
commands as is.

HI

My fvwm module for configuring fvwm is getting along well, and 
I decided to add a gtk dialox box for browsing a color-schemes
directory. After an evening of programming, (and missing wagner's
'parsifal' in cologne, which I wanted to visit, but forgot), I
got a dialog box working to select a color scheme. Unfortunately, 
when acually calling the function to update the colors, this turned
out not to work anymore. 

Initially, in the program (without gtk box) i used the definition:

    $module = new FVWM::Module(
           Mask => (M_STRING|M_NEW_DESK),
           SyncMask => M_STRING,     # needed to process message
synchronously
           Name => "FvwmCDEmu",  # needed for *MyMenuCreator: config value
    );

in this program, communication between fvwm and the module worked fine,
(using module->sendText() in the handler for M_STRING. 
the colors updated as they should. To add a gtk dialog box, I replaced
this definition by the following:

    my $module = new FVWM::Module::Gtk(
            Mask => M_WINDOW_NAME | M_ERROR | M_STRING | M_NEW_DESK,
            SyncMask => M_STRING,     # needed to process message
synchronously
            Name => "FvwmCDEmu",
    );

now, the dialogbox appeared as it should, but communication doesn't seem 
to work anymore. Should it in principle be possible to use such a
declaration for a gtk module? 

best regards

jos

Did you run module-gtkwinlist from examples? Run it using the full path in
FvwmConsole. This opens a GTK dialog that shows a dynamical list of all
windows and several operations to be performed on the selected windows.

Send me your module if you still have problems and I will take a look.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Tired with restrictions in other window managers I have settled into fvwm (a cvs version from last week).  I have managed to solve most of my configuration problems and created a pixmapped style, but the xft text mentioned in the change log is eluding me.  

I have searched the last couple of months of the mailing list, and done some extensive googling... but the only mention is in that change log.  It refers me to the man pages, but for some reason or other I do not have those on my system.  I have seen the ones for 2.4.7, but there is no font loading section in there.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  

Paul

If you are using FVWM from CVS, the file name for the man page

Are you sure you installed the cvs version as you said (make install)?
There is a FONT section in the man that describes Free Type font loading.

Try this line (such font names obviously do not work in 2.4.7):

  Style * Font "xft:Luxi Serif:Bold:pixelsize=14:minspace=true"

No, "man fvwm2" is equivalent to "man fvwm" unless $MANPATH has problems.

Hey, thanks for the speedy response.  

My $MANPATH was set to /usr/share/man:/usr/X11R6/man.  So from the INSTALL.fvwm file I gathered the pages had been put in /usr/local/man/man1... I moved them to usr/share/man/man1, and the problem is solved ('man fvwm' works).  Cheers for the pointer.  Next time I'll be sure to read more before diving in, I am kind of used to the emerge/ports method of install from gentoo :)

BTW fonts look great!

Moving man pages every time you install fvwm is not nice and not needed.
Either update system $MANPATH to include /usr/local/man (a good idea).
Or when installing FVWM do: ./configure --mandir=/usr/share/man

That explains only the sluggish movement.  And then, the problem
was only in 2.5.1, not in 2.4.7.  I'll check that.

Are you *sure* you saw this with 2.4.7 and not 2.5.x?  I can't
reproduce it with 2.4.7, and in the latest 2.5.x code, the slow
movement with gtk widgets is already gone.

This problem may be fixed with my latest commit.  Mikhael, can
you try that again with the latest code from the stable branch?
If it still happens, please send me that config file.

Yes, I'm sure it is 2.4.7.  I downloaded and built it myself.  It is a
local (to my home directory) installation, but I'm sure that the correct
executeable is being called as well.  If it's of any help, I can find out
the particulars of the version of gcalc and Linux distro. (Mandrake ...).

Sorry, I can't be of more help immediately, it is on my work machine.


Is it possible that the Fvwm error was caused in part by me?  I remember
gcalc hanging and not being redrawn.  I then chose to kill it by switching
to a virtual terminal.  As I recall, before killing it, gcalc had a good
chunck of the cpu (X had the rest).  After killing it fvwm started
gobbling up the cpu.  I didn't check for the fvwm error until after I
noticed fvwm taking up a bunch of the cpu cycles.  Did I hit a sensitive
spot in the code?

The gtk version is what matters.

The error message comes from the module interface.  When the
machine is too busy and module messages are not processed for too
long, the module is killed.  It usually happens with FvwmEvent
because it's the most active module.

When that happens again, could you try to attach a debugger and
see where fvwm is looping?  To do this, exit to the console, find
out fvwm's process id with

  $ ps -ax | grep fvwm2

and attach gdb to the running fvwm:

  $ gdb fvwm2 <process-id>

Then fetch a stack trace from gdb

  (gdb) where

and post it.  You might find out more by single stepping through
the code with the "step" command on the gdb prompt.

Why, left click on a link -> new or same window, middle click ->
new tab.  What's the problem?

I don't know how the debian system works, but the commands you
need are EdgeResistance, EdgeScroll and DesktopSize.  Check the
man page.  Normally, you put your configuration commands in your
.fvwm2rc file.

Yes.  Try something like this:

  Key f1 a n Next (unique-name-of-the-applicatein) focusandraise
  AddToFunc FocusAndRaise
  + I Iconify off
  + I Raise
  + I Focus

Hi,

I've finally decided to move from fvwm-1.24r to latest
fvwm2. I've already converted my config file
succesfully, but two minor problems remain. Could any
one help with these?

1) Keyboard accelerators F11 and F12 seem to "steal"
bindings from F1 and F2, respectively. I have in my
.fvwm2rc:

Key F1          A       M       RaiseLower
Key F2          A       M       Popup "Window Ops"
...
Key F11         A       M       Maximize 100 100
Key F12         A       M       Close

If I use Meta+F1, it maximizes the window! If F11 line
is commented out, Meta+F1 does RaiseLower. What's
going on here?

2) I have a menu containing few Popups:

AddToMenu "Utilities"
+              "Program Menu" Title
+              "xterm" Exec exec xterm &
+              "Mozilla" Exec exec mozilla &
+              "" Nop
+              "Applications" Popup Apps
+              "Utilities" Popup Utils
...

There seems to be short delay before a Popup is shown
when I move pointer there. How can I disable this
delay?

My system is RHL7.3.

PS. Is there any plans for fvwm3? If so, does it
understand my new fvwm2 config files?

Thanks in advance!

Take a look at the MenuStyle command.  You prabably want something
like

  MenuStyle * PopupImmediately

There are a whole lot of options to the MenuStyle command that you
might want to check (all in the man page).

Yes, there are plans for a major version 3 and no, if it is ever
released, the config file will be incompatible in large parts.  We
will provide a script to convert configs as usual, but my guess is
that it won't do a very good job.  All this is far into the
future, though (at least a year or two).

I've already tried that, no result. I have following
line in my config file:

MenuStyle Wheat DimGrey Black lucidasanstypewriter-12
Mwm PopupImmediately PopdownImmediately

(all in a single line). It doesn't help even if I use
MenuStyle "*" PopupImmediately separately.

One more question I noticed: in fvwm1 was options
StickyForeColor and StickyBackColor. How can I set
colors for Sticky windows in fvwm2?

Does this mean fvwm version 2.4.6 that is shipped with RedHat 7.3?

What is the output of:

  % xmodmap -pk | grep 'F[12]'

Does it help if you put the binding lines for F11 + F12 before F1 + F2?

fvwm2-2.4.6-1

A great idea, it worked! There seems to be for some
obscure reason definition for F1 and F11 in my F1-key,
but of course that's not fvwm related.

Thanks.

(Answering a question you didn't ask:) The & in your menu probably
don't cause any trouble, but they are unnecessary, as ``Exec exec''
already means that the shell is running the command in background and
exits immediately.

The "&" is indead redudant here, but your explanation is not correct.
The only way to run something in the shell background is to specify "&".

Since this question is raised a lot, here is what actually happens.
Arrow actually means 2 operations: fork and exec in the forked process.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Exec xterm

  fvwm   ->   shell   ->   xterm
  pid=1       pid=2        pid=3

  Process table after 1 second: pid=1, pid=2, pid=3.

fvwm does not wait for shell, shell waits for xterm.
(Some shells like bash do optimizations here, automatically add "exec".)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Exec exec xterm

  fvwm   ->   shell  exec  xterm
  pid=1       pid=2        pid=2

  Process table after 1 second: pid=1, pid=2.

fvwm does not wait for shell, shell is replaced by xterm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Exec xterm &

  fvwm   ->   shell   ->   shell   ->   xterm
  pid=1       pid=2        pid=3        pid=4

  Process table after 1 second: pid=1, pid=3, pid=4.

fvwm does not wait for shell, shell pid=2 forks because of "&" and
immediately exits. shell pid=3 waits for xterm.
(Many shells do optimizations here and behave just like in the case 4.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Exec exec xterm &

  fvwm   ->   shell   ->   shell  exec  xterm
  pid=1       pid=2        pid=3        pid=3

  Process table after 1 second: pid=1, pid=3.

fvwm does not wait for shell, shell pid=2 forks because of "&" and
immediately exits. shell pid=3 is replaced by xterm.


You see, the most optimal is "Exec exec xterm".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Left click is always current window AFAIK. Middle click is new tab.
I have to reach into the cumbersome right-click menu for "Open in new
Window" to get a new window if I'm using tabbed browsing.

If there's something funky I can do with left click to force a new window
(alt-M1 or suchlike) let me know.

Basicly I _want_ single click access to all 3: new window, same window,
new tab.  A menu (click, aim, click again) is a PITA. I have migrated to
tabbed browsing and shifted my habits to want "new window" sufficiently
rarely to live with the menu.

All this is independent of the FVWM issue, which is that is having new
windows (of whatever app) occasionally obscuring the focus window with
the obvious undesirable results. For myself, to be able to force all
new windows (except transients I guess) to be strictly lower than my
current focus window would do.

It should work fine with 2.4.7 regardless of the order of the

That's not a legal MenuStyle line.  You are mixing the old and the
new MenuStyle syntax.  Remove all your MenuStyle lines and try
this instead:

  MenuStyle * mwm, Font lucidasanstypewriter-12
  MenuStyle * Foreground Wheat, Background DimGrey, Greyed Black
  MenuStyle * PopupImmediately, PopdownImmediately

It's important to issue the mwm style first because it resets most
of the other options, including PopupImmediately.

They were removed for some reason in fvwm2.  I don't know exactly
why.  One day the functionality will come back, but right now you
can't do anything about it.

Ok, I made a "workaround" (usually my only Sticky
window is xload so it set colors for it), so don't
worry.

Excellent, I've now ready to finally move from fvwm1
to fvwm2. It took quite a long, but finally it
happened :) Cheers!

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris 8, non-Xinerama dual-head display.  Not
session-managed.

The first restart, on either screen's instance, doesn't finish.
Both PIDs are still there, but on that screen all decorations and
modules vanish; root window menus no longer pop up.  If I then
restart on the other screen (still functional at this point), the
first screen "wakes up" and finishes its restart.  PIDs don't
change.  From this point on, either screen's instance may be
restarted without problem.

Thinking my configuration might be at fault, I killed both instances
and manually ran fvwm2 without one (default configuration) and with
no arguments.  Fvwm2 started on both screens as expected.  The first
Restart on either screen caused that fvwm2 instance to exit with
"<<ERROR>> another ICCCM 2.0 compliant WM is running" [Really? Is it
the other instance?] ", try -replace".  Killed the other instance
and ran fvwm2 without a configuration and with -replace.  Fvwm2
started on both screens as expected.  But as before, the first
Restart on either screen stalled, and "woke up" when the other
screen's instance was restarted.  No problems with restarts
thereafter on either screen.

Any help or suggestions are appreciated.

Gregg Dameron

Two questions to you.

1) How do you start fvwm2 in your .xinitrc or whatever you have?

Hint. There are 2 ways,

  a) starting one instance without -s, it will fork for every screen
  b) starting two instances using -s -d

2) How do you restart?

Hint, you should issue Restart without any parameters.

Are you sure you started with no config, and the default Restart menu
entry caused "another ICCCM 2.0 compliant WM is running"? My understanding
(I don't really have dual-head, so can't test) is that this message may
only happen if you incorrectly restart using "Restart fvwm2". It can't
happen if you do "Restart".

It's possible there are problems with dual-head, feel free to post fixes.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I wouldn't mind seeing some sort of graphical
customisation tool. Unfortunately the dot-file
generator doesn't really cover enough of the features
that fvwm2 has to offer. 

If fvwm3 were to be released for a date in the future,
Dominik, would you consider some kind of "graphical"
customisation tool, similar to what Enlightenment
offers???

Err...to be truthful, I am already amazed at the rate
of development that takes place on Fvwm2, especially
for a volenterr effort.

Unfortunately, that's not really a matter of consideration.  We're
simply too few developers, and the few that do most of the work
don't feel inclined to do it.  In my eyes, a nice and powerful
config tool ist the most important improvement we could make.

Um, I want to say that we do consider it, but that it lacks the
people to do it.

And this should be feasable to do with FvwmScript, so somebodyu who wants
to do it could, I guess..

And I'm doing a config that's customisable using menues. I plan to write
to forms to edit colours and so on.
But this will not be a complete cutomisation tool, only those thing *I*
want to be able to change in run-time =)

I had started working on something that used tcl/tk to do
customizations, along with an "apply" and "restore" options to allow
users to get out of trouble as part of tkgoodstuff.  However, the
extremely long lag time between fvwm2.3 "feature freeze" and 2.4 made
that project fall by the wayside.  However, if anybody would like my
design details (how the applet would work), I still have all those
things.  (What I had in mind was a LOT more useful than the dotfile
generator I had seen in the past, supporting user-defined functions,
etc.)

I might even take on the job once again, but right now, volunteer work
for Destination Imagination and other work has my spare time occupied.

I know I get mostly ignored on these lists, but I've proven that Dan's
nicely modified FvwmForm can save configs and I had a set of forms to
configure EVERY option for fvwm half-built before the fvwm-themes
project even got started. However I recieved zero interest in it from
anybody so I dropped the project since I lacked the skills to do it
properly, and didn't get any feedback at all except some polite comments
from Dan.

Sure FvwmScript is probably a better tool for this, but FvwmForm is a
lot easier. Maybe if anyone was interested, I could dig up my old forms
or start afresh. I've been meaning to try and devise a set of forms for
fvwm-themes configs actually. Or even use FvwmGtk for this, but that
module lacks the read option of FvwmForm.

There were tries to add such tool into FVWM, but not very successfull.
Try for example to run a nice small "FvwmScript FvwmScript-BaseConfig".
Maybe this is because no many FVWM users need such tool? I think the
real reason is that any graphic tool is very limited by its definition.

Either this tool will be dumbed down to some predefined configurations
having users a feeling that FVWM is not configurable, or it will be very
complex and include dozens of screens with dozens of options each.
And this is very optimistic, it may easily include thousands of screens,
with hundrens of options each.

Just think about this. Some statistics about FVWM. We have as of now:

  * 166 commands (and the number grows)
  * 199 Style options (and the number grows)
  * 54 MenuStyle options
  * a lot of TitleStyle/ButtonStyle/BorderStyle options
  * 33 window circulation options
  * 37 WindowList options
  * each Colorset has 23 options (probably 30+ in 2.6.x)
  * 28 modules, some are very configurable with dozens of options each
  * 13 menu placement hints, 7 bug-options, 24 cursor contexts
  * 26 binding contexts, 2^8 modifiers and so on

Now, consider a user configuration that includes dozens of global feel
lines (Style *), many individual Style patterns, several MenuStyle
patterns, dozens of colorsets, dozens of fonts, dozens of menus, dozens
of functions, dozens of keyboard, mouse and stroke bindings. Window
decorations is another endless story. Now, modules. Even if a user is
limited to one FvwmButtons with one FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager swallowed
and several other applications swallowed, there are still millions of
combinations to create such FvwmButtons panel.

So everyone should choose what he wants, a full control or simplified
graphical tool with predefined configurations. You can't do everything
with graphical tools only.

Saying all this, we do have graphical tools in fvwm-themes for defining a
full global feel, settings like animation/sound-player/gnome/kde, a menu
editor and (started) bindings editor. Is this something that Thomas Adam
originally asked for? What do you miss in fvwm-themes, except that it is
not integrated directly into fvwm (which is a plus)?

I believe that such tool should be written as a module using Perl/Gtk.
As much as I like FvwmScript, its scripting ability is far down to the
perl scripting, and its widget functionality is not as good as GTK+.

Exactly. Someone should limit his graphical tool to some predefined
hardcoded configuration just to make such graphical tool possible at all.

For example, I write a completely new module (it will be available in
fvwm-themes) that enables persistent dynamical configuration of a panel
using menus. This module is useless in other themes that don't have such
panel. Every theme has its own configuration.

No graphical tool enables a full customization, some manual configuration
or even programming is always needed to create something good and new.

Anyway, if some programmer wants to seriously work (many months) on a
generic graphical tool, he should contact me and Olivier first to discuss
the design of such tool, we have some experience in doing this.

Mikhael.

My setup uses (a), with -replace and -f <config>.  The problem goes away if I
use (b).  Sounds like that's my workaround.

I restart with --dont-preserve-state, but an unadorned restart gives me the
same problem.

Absolutely.  When I started, I got the "Cannot read startup file, tried:
<list> " error, and the built-in config took over.  I can then cause the
exit-with-ICCCM-error either by (1) using the root menu Restart ("R. Restart
FVWM"), or (2) bringing up FvwmConsole from the root menu ("4. Issue FVWM
commands") and entering "Restart".

  and user defined functions - how would one add functions in gui tool?
and make gui tool aware of them? the tool would have to be something
like delphi/c++builder/visual basic programming environment. not
impossible but it would be a BIG project...

I think I answered you already:

2.6.0 will certainly support this feature. :)

The answer is "no". The author probably has a patch for 2.4.7, ask her.
We only add fixes to the stable branch once the unstable is started.

I don't worry about this, ask until you get an answer.

You can get the patch for 2.4.7 at
http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/configs/fvwm-patch. Put it in the top-level
source directory and type "patch -p0 <fvwm-patch.

You can then activate the feature, after ./configure, by changing "#undef
FANCY_TITLEBARS" in config.h to "#define FANCY_TITLEBARS", and uncommenting it.

I agree that FVWM should always expect vi (or Emacs) to
be the configuration tool of choice.  There are so many things a
gui can't anticipate.

I guess I should have known about "FvwmScript FvwmScript-BaseConfig",
maybe I've seen it before but I forgot about it.  I'll have
to add it to my menus.
Maybe we should do more work on the FVWM built-in menu.
(Like add this tool to it.)

FVWM does have some GUI configuration already, its just
not very visible.

I don't think xterm is going to do this for you.  If you use aterm
instead, it has a "-fade" command line option.

Starting an aterm as "aterm -fade 0" will cause it to go black
when unfocussed.

Hi Fvwm2'ers

Can I ask what happened to the Stroke support in the CVS versions of
Fvwm2? It always says:

*FvwmConsole version 2.5.2
Stroke
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'Stroke'


TIA

Andr

PS: Yes, I compiled it with stroke support.

FvwmScript-BaseConfig by itself is not very useful, it should be
integrated somewhere. It is integrated into the Setup95 that we have
in the default menu. Setup95 is a good start for new to FVWM users,
it has some elements of fvwm-themes, but in a very stripped form.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I use dual monitors with FVWM's SLS feature, and for the most part it 
works quite well.. however, I would like to tailor the window placement 
a bit but I have no idea if it's possible.

What I'd like is for the windows to be placed according to one of the 
normal placement schemes, but to be placed on the screen that contains 
the mouse pointer at the time the window pops up.

Is that possible? Probably not in big demand, so I'll understand if it's 
not, but I thought I'd ask. It would just relieve the minor irritation 
of launching something from a menu and then having to trek across the 
screen to retrieve it all the time :)

Cheers,

--

...you could try various ManualPlacement* "Style" options.  after
finding about other kinds of placement, namely MinOverlap*Placement,
i now hate that style.

No, you are not ignored.  It's just that we really need somebody
who manages that project.  I have virtually no time for that and I
gues it's the same with Mikhael and Olivier.  I would take part in
any discussion that someone else brings up, but I'm unable to
start it myself.

Oops, I must have missed the original message.  Anyway, the right
way to achieve this is the StartsOnScreen style:

  Style * StartsOnScreen c

(c = current screen = screen with the pointer).  Put that line in
your .fvwm2rc file.

Mmm I'm looking forward to see this. Are
you using gtk-perl to do this? I'm thinking 
about writing a cde-like panel for my setup.
Although I'm not shure yet if I should write
such a panel from scratch, or, alternatively,
write an applet for the gnome panel that mimicks
the look of the cde panel. This way one can
inherit the functionality of the gnome panel. 


best regards

jos

For example, I write a completely new module (it will be available in
fvwm-themes) that enables persistent dynamical configuration of a panel
using menus. This module is useless in other themes that don't have such
panel. Every theme has its own configuration.

It is in the fvwm-themes cvs. But it has a long way to go, first
FvwmButtons is going to be modified to be more dynamic (add button/
delete button/hide container without restarting FvwmButtons).

No, it uses FVWM menus and in the future FvwmGtk or FvwmForm for dialogs.

The CDE panel included in fvwm-themes is pretty good. Two FvwmButtons
configs (small and large) are generated by a script, based on your work.

But if you want a gtk-based solution, why not to use xfce? It is a stand
alone gtk-based configurable CDE panel that may be used with FVWM.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The man page (2.4.7) speaks of this Style only in an Xinerama context.
Does it work for dual fvwm instances as well?
