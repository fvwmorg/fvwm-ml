This workaround should work for your problems:
----------------------------------------------

- Remove all lines from your .bashrc, /etc/bashrc,
  /etc/profile that set PS1 or PROMPT_COMMAND.

- Put these lines in your .bashrc:

    PS1='$MY_PS1'
    export MY_PS1

  The quoting is important here.

- Verify that the promtvars bash option is set with

    shopt promptvars

  If not, put this line in your .bashrc:

    shopt -s promptvars

- Now whenever you would have set PS1, set MY_PS1 instead.
  You will have to change all your scripts, but at least
  this works.


Background:
-----------

1) Unlike most (probably all) other shells, bash *deletes*
   the contents of PS1 if it is non-interactive (i.e. if
   you run a script with bash). This is documented
   behaviour however.

2) Under Linux, /bin/sh is a link to bash.

3) The startx, xinitrc and xserverrc use /bin/sh = bash as
   their executing shell and fvwm (and probably twm) execute
   commands with /bin/sh.

4) When you start X11 with startx, the startx script strips
   the contents of PS1. If you use xserverrc or xinitrc they
   do the same as does fvwm.


What you should do:
-------------------

Write a bug report to the bash developers. It may be a good
idea to not set PS1 to the default in a non-interactive bash,
but deleting an already set PS1 is a bad idea. Nobody has
noticed before because nearly everyone sets the prompt in
some configuration file. The effect is that when a non-interactive
bash starts a new interactive bash, the new shell does not get
the exported prompt. I have tested tcsh, zsh and pdksh on my
Linux, and all of these work well.

The 'bug' or feature (remember it is documented on the manpage)
can be verified with the following command:

  echo 'echo PS1 = $PS1' | bash

The reasons to change this are:

 - No noteworthy gain by deleting PS1 this saves only a few
   bytes.

 - Better compatibility with other shells (ksh and probably
   posix sh)

If there are problems to communicate this bug to the bash
developers, please contact me again and I will explain it
in detail. I do not want to make the report myself since
I have no time for that if it is not necessary.

You are completely sane (at least concerning you problem ;-) ). In fact
it is very easy to reproduce your problem (see my other posting for a
solution).

Yes, I came to the same conclusion about bash after receiving an email
from list-reader Michael Tiefenback <tiefen@jlab.org>. Unfortunately
he was getting PS1 being *the same* in .xinitrc-spawned and fvwm-spawned
xterms, but this gave me a tremendous impetus to keep digging.

Hmm ... I checked the documentation beforehand and couldn't see any
mention of this. Re-reading this on the bash man page:

       An interactive shell ....  PS1 is set
       and $- includes i if bash is interactive, ...

you can't infer that a non-interactive shell has PS1. Although just the
mention of this is 'suspicious' :-)

You suggested I should change all my scripts, but that isn't terribly
portable or graceful. I see fvwm2 has an 'ExecUseShell' configuration
command. I think it would be neater to use it to explicity specify an
alternative shell for fvwm2 to use - in light of /bin/sh being bash
under most Linux distributions.

it the name of a script that simply prepends '-i' to the argument 
list and exec's bash?

Yes, I eventually strace'd an already-running fvwm2 proess and found
how it was exec'ing menu items, and simulated the problem with this
bit of code a bit closer to how fvwm2 is doing it as follows:

PS1="newprompt> "
export PS1
/bin/bash -c 'echo $PS1'                <-- PS1 lost
/bin/bash -i -c 'echo $PS1'             <-- PS1 not lost

The implication being that if bash is invoked with command line parameters
which do not suggest it's an interactive shell (e.g. with a script
or -c <command>) then it presumes *incorrectly* that it's *never* going to
'give rise to' an interactive. Which is *too* presumtious.

> Write a bug report to the bash developers. It may be a good

I will shortly - I'd like to hear the results of a little test I asked
Michael to do first though.

[ Michael, you might as well post them back on the list I think, even
though it's becoming apparent it's a shell problem rather than an fvwm2
problem - at least it will go into the mailing list archive and become
searchable - which is where I tried before posting here (and after
checking newsgroup FAQs and posting to newsgroups). ]

Try pressing Shift or Ctrl once _after_ starting the move. I'm sure it's in
the above FAQ as well.

This must be some default configuration of XFree, since vanilla X11R6.1 on a

more useful, IMHO.

OTOH, in my Sparc, kp_9 moves up instead of right+up diagonal... I should read

What does "messed up" exactly mean? BTW, that keybinding doesn't look a

Looking like Xdefaults... If nobody sets PS1, then you must have a fresh

Well, of course this one wins the prize. This rang a bell (a cathedral-sized
one). Not sure about the "documented" bit, however. But the recommended bash
trick for detecting a non-interactive shell is '[ -z "$PS1" ]'!! It does leave 
one suspicious...

Redhat even distributes an /etc/bashrc containing the following pearl:
"...
# For some unknown reason bash refuses to inherit
# PS1 in some circumstances that I can't figure out.
# Putting PS1 here ensures that it gets loaded every time.
PS1="[\u@\h \W]\\$ "

Argh.

Sorry about that.

Recommended by whom? :)

The _correct_, always completely accurate, way to test for interactivity
in ksh, bash, and zsh is to test the $- option variable to see if it
contains "i" or not.

  case "$-" in
    *i*) echo "Interactive!" ;;
    *)   echo "Not interactive!" ;;
  esac

See the man page.

The _only_ reason to use PS1 is if you must maintain backward
compatibility with older Bourne shells.  This should really never be
much of a concern in places where you'd expect to see this type of test.

Hi,

Does anyone know how to configure fvwm2 (AnotherLevel) in Red Hat Linux
5.1 so as to have the wharf visible on the desktop all the time, that
is, irrespective of the wmstyle? Normally, wharf can be open from the
System Utilities/Wharf menu. In a previous version of RHL I used to put
<<"+I" Exec Function Wharf>> in fvwm2rc.init but in 5.1 this leaves
running something called FvwmButtons98 which eats up about 98% of CPU!

Thank you very much for any help you can provide.

laurentiu

I've installed all the Xpm/Xaw lib and development packages and even the xpm ones.  I can't figure it out.  Xpm.h is in /usr/include/X11/(something) so gcc should be finding it...

Hi,
  I've just setup FVWM version 2.1.0 on a Solaris 2.5.1
system.  DumbPlacement doesn't seem to be working anymore.
Here is the line from my .fvwm2rc file:

Style "*"           ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

The other placement options seem to be working fine.
Any ideas???  Thanks...

	I just tried it out. Actually, DumbPlacement seems to
be working all too well. It's the ActivePlacement that doesn't
take, so FVWM falls back to DumbPlacement, which you hardly ever
see, normally.

	I'm looking at the placement code right now, so I'll
see if I can figure out what got broken. Does anyone else have
any idea what's been done to the placement code? It was still
working fine in the 2.0.47d alpha.

I tried this but it didn't seem to help.  I had just re-built Imake so i imagine that probably took care of it.

These were both part of the problem.  Apparently my libXpm.a was in /usr/X11R6.3/lib instead, so i just copied the files (i would have sym. linked them, but i seem to always mess things up with that); it was a dirty solution, but i don't have much time for anything else right now.

Anyway it compiled now.  Thanks so much for the help

(ps  apparently the message sent twice...my apologies)

Hello,

I am running Fvwm2. I get the following errors when I startx.
What are they really referring to and how can I debug them. Should I be
using M4 preprocessing?

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'I' in ModulePath 
'/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'
Warning: Cannot convert string "nil2" to type 
FontStruct


TIA,

Neil

Probably some configuration error in your .fvwm2rc. My guess
is that Some '+'-line to AddToMenu, AddToFunc etc. is not
in correct format. Perhaps the + is missing or another
word comes before the "I" (=immediate in functions).

This error occurs when fvwm finds some word in the config
file it doesn't know. It then tries to execute it as a module.

I'm trying to build fvwm 2.0.46 on AIX 4.2.0. Have you tried this? I'm
missing an include file called /usr/include/sys/stdsyms.h. This file exists
on HP, but not on my AIX system. Do you have any ideas about what I might be
doing wrong?

Karen

I've had problems w/ missing include files/filesets w/ my AIX 
installation.  You might want to try 

http://service.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/support/rs6000.support/downloads

to see if you can get the files that you need.

Hello,

Is there any way that I can exit the Fvwm2 window manager with a command, for
example by invoking it from a shell script?

Thanks,

Neil

Helas, unfortunately, I tend to step into such vanilla Bourne shells daily...
Mostly at login time. To be "always completely accurate" you _have_ to use it.

And that's for login shells. Now, /bin/sh != /bin/bash, mostly (only in
Linux). zsh, never saw it. ksh, only in my Solaris (since I'm in charge).
Sigh.

(Not to mention the places where you are stuck with a *csh;
 "if ($?prompt == 0)", anyone?)

Now, where's that fvwm 2.1.0 someone mentioned? I missed the announcement.

Don't get it: if you're using sh, then you can use the PS1 test safely.
If you're using bash, you can use the $- test in .bashrc (which won't be

Obviously.  But the point is, the login scripts for shells are almost
never really portable, anyway.  For bash (and ksh and zsh--zsh is also
free like bash, you have to go get it and compile and install it) you
can use the $- test.  For Bourne use PS1, and it works.

Maybe I missed the point of what you wanted to do.

  jmp> Now, where's that fvwm 2.1.0 someone mentioned? I missed the

Fvwm development has moved to a release numbering scheme like Linux,
where odd releases are betas.  The first in a series which will
hopefully culminate soon in the Fvwm 2.2 stable release is 2.1.0.  It's
being announced and discussed on the fvwm-workers list; if you want to
use it you'll need to join the workers list and follow along... :)

But PS1 does work in ALL of them, except for that bash nonsense. BTW, zsh
doesn't nuke PS1... Probably the safest thing for everyone is to make /bin/sh
-> zsh (it's designed to work like that, too). Except if you have inflicted a
Redhat Linux distrib. on your machine. You can't even upgrade bash from 1.14.7
there. I know, I tried it. Not sure about zsh, though...

Ok. The point is that I try to have a nice portable shell setup. Probably
silly, but it mostly, let's say 99%, works. The 1% left, like Alexis' problem,
isn't usually visible -- unless you really _need_ it (such as in his case).

Now, to get that 1%, I really would have to (*shiver*) clean up some 5-6 years
of accumulated *sh dust... (Let's see, I got this "portable sh" stuff started
in 1993... From a package called "Elfshell", by Christopher North-Keys,
Talisman Group).

I see. Fine, I'll lurk there :-)
(unfortunately, I don't have much time right now to be of any help, sorry. And 
there are a couple things I think still missing in this fine WM...)

Hash: SHA1

I recently installed RedHat 5.0 and found that fvwm2 behaved differently 
than it did under 4.2.  It took me a couple of weeks to track down the right 
word for the difference:  warp.

I noticed that when I would push the Start button, my cursor would jump to 
the top of the Start pop-up menu.  When I would select screen lock, the 
cursor would jump to the default button on that window.  So, after I 
discovered (by scanning the archive of this list) that this was called 
"warp", I at least knew what to look for.

I realize this is a matter of personal preference, but to me cursor warp is 
as bad as CAPS LOCK -- something to be killed completely.

I finally did a find,grep and found all references to warp under /etc/X11 -- 
and commented them out of the config files.

This leaves me almost satisfied.

I still have the problem that clicking Start warps me to the top of that menu.

How do I stop that?  Is there a hidden config file for that or is it buried 
in the executable someplace?

Are there other config files I need to find so that I can nuke the warping?

Thanks,

	Carl

Hello,

I am thinking of having M4 pre-process my .fvwm2rc file but before doing 
so I would like to know the following: What does M4 exactly do? What does it 
stand for? What was the motivation behind the creation of M4?
Can I use it define and undefine variables just like within a C program?
What are the pros and cons of M4 pre-processing?

Thanks for your feedback,

Neil

Thanks for the reply,

You were right about the missing plus. I should have known better.

I think it would be somewhat handy though if the errors reported line numbers
just like gcc does. This would make it easier to spot mistakes in big files.

I'm trying to set a `hotkey' for checking my mail (a shell window
called 'Mutt'). I would like it to pop up my mail window and focus it.
Afterwards, it should iconify the mail window again and return focus
to whatever window I was working in before.

The closest I could get is this:

  AddToFunc PopWindow     "I"     Iconify
  +                       "I"     Focus

  AddToFunc PushWindow    "I"     Iconify
  +                       "I"     FlipFocus

  key n   A       MC      Current [Mutt !Iconic] PushWindow
  Key m   A       MC      Next [Mutt Iconic] PopWindow

But this solution suffers from the following problems:
- The FlipFocus in the PushWindow function doesn't always work.
  Depending on the position of my mouse pointer, focus is either
  correctly set to the window I was working in *or* to the iconified
  mail window.
- Would it be possible to write a smarter function which combines the
  functionality of these two functions? That way I could have on
  hotkey which toggles between the current window and the mail window.

BTW: I am using `SloppyFocus' on all my windows.

Thanks in advance for your help,
-Ives

Thanks for the idea Neil, I will add this to the TODO list:

  - Investigate reporting file, and line number when issuing error messages.
    Note that some commands are generated by modules, on pipes and in
    these cases it could be a little tricky figuring out where the command
    came from, and it doesn't really have a line number.

I have recently tried to start using FvwmM4 as a preprocessor for my
rc file, and have had some problems.

First though, the reason I opted for M4 (instead of Cpp) is that I
need multi-line macro definitions.  I don't think this is possible
with Cpp, but please correct me if I am wrong...

Now, if I tell my FvwmConsole to

	FvwmM4 fvwm2rc.m4

it will happily parse the file correctly, and add all the relevant
definitions to the current fvwm2 state.  However, when I try to either 
start or Restart with

	fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4  fvwm2rc.m4"

I get

	[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 FVWMRC.m4"'
	failed!!!! (restarting 'fvwm2' instead)

and I cannot figure out why.  I am using 2.0.46, and I have been
unable to find anything wrong with m4 or the rc file which might be
the problem.  Any ideas why the -cmd invocation bombs?

Thanks,

CJW

For some reason, when fvwm2 (v2.0.46) parses my .fvwm2rc file and
finds the line

    ColormapFocus   FollowsFocus

it produces the following error:

    [FVWM][SetColormapFocus]: <<ERROR>> ColormapFocus requires 1 arg:

And yet, when I cut and paste that same line into an FvwmConsole, it
sets the color focus correctly without complaint.

Any ideas?

There must be *exactly* one space between ColormapFocus and
FollowsFocus. This will be fixed in the next release though.

I did not try it, but cpp accepts multi line macros too (escape
the line end with a backslash).

Never figured out why this message occurs, but in my setup
fvwm2 restarts and still uses the preprocessor.

You don't need to specify the -cmd on the Restart line...

Just say:

	Restart fvwm2

And fvwm2 does the right thing.

>From the manual page:

       Restart  WindowManagerName
              Causes  fvwm to restart itself if WindowManagerName
              is "fvwm2", or to switch  to  an  alternate  window
              manager if WindowManagerName is other than "fvwm2".
              If the window manager is not in your default search
              path,  then  you  should use the full path name for
              WindowManagerName.

              This command should not have a  trailing  ampersand
              or  any  command line arguments and should not make
              .....

The 'Restart' command is *not* a way to re-execute fvwm2. It is
a way to *restart* itself, or to *execute* *other* window managers.
Since you're not re-execing fvwm2, the syntax doesn't follow exec-like
syntax.

Note that it says no command line arguments allowed.

Use 'RestartFunction' to restart modules.

Hi!

1st point, sorry for my no-english

I have a very annoying problem. I had it with RedHat 4.2 and now with
5.0 (with other wm's I never nad it). It consists in the fact that after
some time working, suddenly one window refuses to leave the foreground.
When I click on another window, it blinks but nothing changes. I can
even move windows around an resize them, and select menus and such, but
as the windows aren't selected, I can't write in them. If I close the
super-window, some other receives his super-powers.
One way that never fails to reproduce this, is try to debug something in
xwpe. The window in wich the app being debugged run is "bewitched", and
there's no way to return to xwpe window.

My instalation is pretty standard. I have an AMD586 + S3ViRGE. The only
changes I have made to the standard config where to set-up X to use 3
buttons mouse, and use tcsh as the shell. Now than I think on this, The
first windows in  degenerate are xterms, mostly.

Thanks in advance,

Jorge

I got a question on .fvwm2rc. How could I get AutoRaise (pointer to
raise the window to the top of the stack) instead of "click to raise?"
 in .fvwm2rc?

Thank you.

The FvwmAuto module does exactly this. Try the manpage.

	The compiler can't find the Xpm library.  Make sure the

Hello,

I would like to upgrade to 2.0.47.

Where can I get the full distribution from?

The site <http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/> was last

updated "May 25" and does not have any reference to fvwm2 2.0.47.

TIA,

Neil Zanella

I hope that the person who recieves this can help, as i am not really
sure where it is sending to, I have a Pentium 200MMX Packard Bell
(Hell), with a PS/2 mouse, when i run X as root or any other user the
mouse pointer freaks out when X is loaded, When i move the mouse it has
a tendency to jump to the lower left corner, it will move sometimes but
when it does it always jumps to different spots the stops at the lower
left corner of the screen, any help on this would be appreciated as with
this problem i cannot run X at all and i am stuck with MS Win untill i
get this fixed

I didn't know if I could post a question concerning fvwm95 -- but I
couldn't find a mailing list for the '95' flavor . . .

I am using fvwm95 on Linux.  I would like the cursor to change to either
an hourglass or watch while a program is loading.  I have impatient
users that think just because the cursor doesn't change, the program
isn't coming.  They click and click . . . . and then they wonder why
they have 5 sessions of the same program and netscape lock files !!!

Is there a way ???

Thanks,

Hey Neil

M4 is a macro processor that has been around in unix for a long time.
Your best bet is to read the man page for it on your system (or info
page if you have GNU M4).


> Can I use it define and undefine variables just like within a C program?

Yes. That is what I mostly use it for. For example I do stuff like this:

  m4_define(FORE_COLOUR, `Gray')
  m4_define(EDITOR_COLOUR, `GoldenRod')

  Style "Emacs" Color FORE_COLOUR/EDITOR_COLOUR
  Style "XJed"  Color FORE_COLOUR/EDITOR_COLOUR
  Style "xedit" Color FORE_COLOUR/EDITOR_COLOUR

Makes changing settings much easier. That's simple. You can do much more
interesting things, too.


> What are the pros and cons of M4 pre-processing?

Read the FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp man pages to compare M4 and cpp.

I am using v2.0.46 under HPUX 10.20, and can't get past 3 problems:

1.	Whenever I try to use the scroll bar, the window locks up.  This
happens when I try to grab the slider, or click in the scroll bar, or
click on the up/down arrows in the bar.  The only way out is to kill the
window and open a new one.

2.	I cannot invoke click-to-focus.  Regardless of focus setting in
.fvwm2 it stays in focus-follows-mouse without auto-raise.  I know I'm
invoking the correct .fvwm2 because the menu buttons are correct.

3.	The only way to raise a window seems to be to click in the top bar. 
I want to be able to click anywhere in a window to raise it.

Any help you can offer would be appreciated.

Thanks

Ralph Bigio

Warping depends on the type of menus you use. I don't know which
version you are using, so I can't tell you how exactly to do this.
You are probably using FVWM menus at the moment. MWM-style menus
don't warp, FVWM menus do. So changing the menu style should help
(I think the command is called MenuStyle, but I don't know much
about 'history').

The variable PPosOverride is declared as "Boolean" in fvwm.c, but is
referenced as "extern Bool" in other files. This causes a bus error on
IRIX machines. Enclosed is a patch to fixup fvwm.c and simply change
the variable to be declared as "Bool" which fixes the problem. This is
for fvwm-2.0.46.

I am using v2.0.46 under HPUX 10.20, and can't get past 3 problems:

1.	Whenever I try to use the scroll bar, the window locks up.  This
happens when I try to grab the slider, or click in the scroll bar, or
click on the up/down arrows in the bar.  The only way out is to kill the
window and open a new one.

2.	I cannot invoke click-to-focus.  Regardless of focus setting in
.fvwm2 it stays in focus-follows-mouse without auto-raise.  I know I'm
invoking the correct .fvwm2 because the menu buttons are correct.

3.	The only way to raise a window seems to be to click in the top bar. 
I want to be able to click anywhere in a window to raise it.

Any help you can offer would be appreciated.

Thanks

Ralph Bigio

	Good catch.

	FYI, this is fixed in the latest development source tree, so the
next formal release (Real Soon Now, I hope) will carry the correction.
It's the inverse of your patch, though. It seems that somebody did an
exercise in resolving the Bool/Boolean discrepancies, and changed all
the *other* declarations to "Boolean".

I submitted this bug about 2 1/2 years ago :-) ... sigh.

btw:  If anyone else has an SGI O2 with the dual channel display, talk to
     me.  I have some very rough patches to deal with the 1280x2048 screen
     as 2 mostly sepearate entieies.

What scrollbars? Application scrollbars or FvwmScroll scrollbars?

Still the config file is usually called .fvwm2rc

No. In the next release it will be possible.

Eh? This is the behavior defined by the pairs:
ClickToFocusRaises/ClickToFocusDoesntRaise
&
MouseFocusClickRaises/MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise
which are GlobalOpts. See the fvwm2 manpage... unless you're using
fvwm1. Don't know about SloppyFocus, though...

Not quite. This works only if you use ClickToFocus, not with
the mouse following focus styles. You could wand to have
autofocus and still raise windows by clicking in the application
part of the window (in fact I use it and I love it).

The "How do I enable click to raise" issue has been mentioned a few times
in recent days.  I use the following mouse binding:

Mouse 1         W       M       RaiseLower

to enable <Alt>-Button1 as a RaiseLower mechanism.  Such things can fail
if the application also wants to use this as an input mechanism from the
user.  I ran into this one when one application failed to run with "Cannot
access private resource" errors (I don't remember the exact syntax).  It
was educational, at least.  I hope this isn't entirely a waste of
bandwidth.

    I looked at the settings that where in the MonitorsDB and  Monitors
files but  could not quite understand what i was looking at yet, for
some reason my desktop appears as though it is running in  a 640x480
format and the graphics in netscape look as though they are all in a 8
bit format , any  single answer that could fix this?

    Also I have now discovered the "AfterStep" desktop in fvwm, is this
part of fvwm,  or another program in its self? (I have Red Hat 5.1
installed)

FlipFocus is meant to be used only in conjunction with Prev.  e.g.
+ "I" Prev [CurrentDesk !Iconic] FlipFocus
For what you are doing you may as well use Focus here.  FlipFocus is a
way of changing the order of the windowlist so that Prev [] FlipFocus,
Prev [] FlipFocus toggles back and forth between two windows.

This is where None comes into its own:

# function to toggle iconic state of Mutt window
AddToFunc ToggleMail "I" Next [Mutt !Iconic] HideMutt
+                    "I" None [Mutt !Iconic] ShowMutt
# function to iconify Mutt
AddToFunc HideMutt   "I" Iconify
+                    "I" Prev [CurrentDesk !Iconic] Focus
# function to de-iconify or start Mutt
AddToFunc ShowMutt   "I" Next [Mutt] Iconify
+                    "I" None [Mutt] Exec mutt
+                    "I" None [Mutt] Wait Mutt
+                    "I" Next [Mutt] Focus

Hope this helps,
Tim.

Thanks. I'm not sure I understand it, but it does work better (the
focussing is correct now). Is there a good explanation somewhere about
the windowlist and how the focussing of windows is influenced by the
various commands?

This still doesn't work. It does pop up the window (or indeed start it
if it's not there yet) but instead of hiding it, it will hide it and
then pop it up again. Seems like the first line changes the windowlist
so that the second one is always executed.
So I'm still stuck with two keys:

  AddToFunc StartMutt     "I" Exec rxvt -geometry 80x55+450+50 -font Screen16 -title Mutt -n Mutt -e mutt

  AddToFunc ShowMutt      "I" Next [Mutt] Iconify -1
  +                       "I" None [Mutt] StartMutt
  +                       "I" None [Mutt] Wait Mutt
  +                       "I" Next [Mutt] Focus

  AddToFunc HideWindow    "I" Iconify 1
  +                       "I" Prev [CurrentDesk !Iconic] Focus

  AddToFunc HideMutt      "I" Current [Mutt !Iconic] HideWindow

  key m   A       MC      ShowMutt
  key n   A       MC      HideMutt


Thanks!,

'fraid not.  There is the source.

My understanding is that there is a list that fvwm builds.  When windows
are created they are added to the end of the list.  Fvwm also maintains
a pointer to the window which has the focus called the current window.
The Next command starts at the current window and works its way down the
list until it finds a window which matches it's list of conditions.  It
then sets another pointer (Scr->tmp) to this window and calls the
function in it's argument.  Prev is the same but it works back up the
list.  Both commands wrap around the top and bottom and stop if they get
back to the current window.  The None command starts at the current
window and stops if it finds a match for its conditions, it only
executes its function if it gets back to the current window.

The fact that Next/Prev start at the current window but set Scr->tmp
explains why you can't do Next, Next, Next to go three windows around
the windowlist since each Next starts at the same point.

If you change the focus with the mouse the newly focussed window is
moved to the  end of the list and the current window pointer is
updated.  The Focus command just moves the current window pointer.  Prev
Focus and Next Focus do not alter the windowlist order but moving focus
with the mouse does.  FlipFocus moves the focus in the same way as
changing the Focus with the mouse i.e. it puts the target window to the
end of the windowlist and updates the current window.

Umm, looks like HideMutt is changing the Iconic state of Mutt before the
None conditions are evaluated.  Try the following:

AddToFunc ToggleMutt "I" Next [Mutt] Iconify
+                    "I" None [Mutt !Iconic] Prev [CurrentDesk !Iconic]
Focus
+                    "I" None [Mutt] exec mutt
+                    "I" None [Mutt] Wait Mutt
+                    "I" Next [Mutt !Iconic] Focus

Cheers,
Tim.

Add a line doing whatever you want right below the line that starts fvwm2,
usually xinitrc, startx or something.

I don't suppose there's an undocumented StaysOnBottom window style
that would be the obvious analogue to StaysOnTop?

Having recently installed Rasterman's Eterm, I would like to run my
console in a transparent Eterm, essentially making it look like part
of the root window, and I would only want it above other windows when
I explicitly raise it.

So, if there isn't such a beast, *could* there be, oh ye mighty
developers out there? :)

No, sorry. StayOnTop uses a flag and there aren't any spares

One day. After the great style flag rewrite.  There is a hack that will
keep just one window at the bottom.  FvwmAuto can call any arbitrary
function and you can use that to keep lowering a particular window e.g.

Module FvwmAuto AutoLower
AddToFunc AutoLower "I" Next [ ConsoleWindow ] Lower

If you start your eterm with the name ConsoleWindow it will get lowered
whenever you change focus.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

Is this related to the following command in 'AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I"'
function or works in conjuction with that. Can anybody explain ?

+       "I" Next [!iconic CurrentScreen xterm] Focus

  Tak> test planning and info: http://www.year2000.com/archive/testing.html

Here I found the following:

	A Y2K Compliance Definition 

    1.For all dates in storage, the century is unambiguous.

    2.All operations give consistent results whether dates in the data, or the
      current system date, are before or after the millennial New Year's Eve.

    3.February 29, 2000 is properly recognized as a leap day. 

    4.All dates are properly and unambiguously recognized and presented on
      input and output interfaces (screens, reports, files, etc.).

I found fvwm, fvwm2 to be "Y2K Compliant" by the above as:

1. Yes. Whatever. No storage of dates. Only X timestamps, which cannot be
related to dates.

2. Yes. The same features and bugs will work correctly as designed. fvwm2
won't even know it's New Year's Eve, much less millennial.

3. ...And correctly handled with extreme indifference.

4. Never saw problems with dates in screens, reports, or files used, or
generated by, fvwm/fvwm2. On second thought, I never saw dates in screens,
reports, or files used, or generated by, fvwm/fvwm2. Don't even think it's
possible. Fvwm is appallingly impervious to dates, in fact.

Therefore,

I hereby certificate the Y2K Compliance of FVWM and FVWM2.

Tell them I said so.

Now, could we please consider this "Fvwm & Year 2000" affair closed?

Great, at least I know what I'm doing now :^).

I think it would be a good idea to put this in the man page as it
seems to be rather essential for understanding Next/Prev/Current/etc.

Hello !

Next and Prev are working fine but in my case I want to go to window on
page to which I am switching to (Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus) .
But if there is no window meeting the condition then while switching back
to previous screen page I get to other window then the last acive.
Maybe there should be some empty position always on top of list meaning no
active window (root active?).

While I am changing active window from WindowList or using Next or Prev
commands positions on list are unchanged but while doing that by clicking
on a window that window gets number 1 on the list.
In my opinion app window should get its number while it is created and 
release it when closed. It will be nice to get to the window just by
calling WindowList and then the same number/letter. Now it is not very
user friendly because number by which I activate window may change many
times and I must read windows list to find my app.

Question: is somebody working on a module which switches windows like
W95 does (acivates window while ALT or another modifier is released
so we can press ALT and then Tab many times to get to correct window
(using IconName and title to display info)  and then activating it by
releasing ALT; ESC shuld cancel action) ?

Sometimes I will prefer window with no decor at all. I want maximize my
app window to full screen with no decor. But I want it to be done by
setting a flag so I can revert to normal/previous state (with previous
decor). Because decor was build on window creation I don't want to build
it again just switch on/off. Is there simple solution to this ?

I have implemented such a "module" within tkgoodstuff.  Unfortunately,
the author of tkgoodstuff has delivered his "final" release last year. 
He has not designated a successor, but rather left his sources for
somebody to eventually pick up:

	8.0: Here I (MC) leave off development of tkgoodstuff.  Anyone who
 	     would like to adopt it is most welcome.

Over the last few months, I have made some changes to tkgoodstuff, most
specifically supporting FVWM's mini-icons (used in the WindowList
module).  I also added some more configuration options, and added a few
new modules of my own.
 
One of my changes is a Switcher module that can be bound to a keystroke
(for example, Alt+Tab).  The Switcher module acts like  Windoze's
ALT-TAB switcher:  It brings up a window showing the mini-icons of all
windows available and the title of one of them.

When launched via a keyboard event, pressing the bound keystroke
repeatedly will advance through all the mini-icons and window names. 
When the modifier key (e.g. Alt) is released, the module will hide its
window and then focus (and optionally warp) to the last window that was
displayed.

The only problem for me to distribute this is that I would need to
repackage my environment as a new distribution.  I don't think that I
have the time right now to be the maintainer of tkgoodstuff, and the
Switcher module requires some changes that I made to other modules
(tkFvwm.c, Fvwm.tcl, icons, etc.).

Maybe I'll bite the bullet and create a tkgoodstuff 8.1.

I just used key bindings to do this.  Alt Tab will execute a Warp.  But
a module would indeed be necessary to have the icon info displayed for
each alt tab.

Does anyone know if Mike Finger is still maintaining the FvwmWinList
module?  The last version I have is from '96, and neither email address
offered in the man page work.  Anyway, I'm interested in contributing to
the effort, as there are several things I'm interested in seeing
implemented.

Nice. This might do many of the things I've always wanted to do in my

Fine, but it would be nice to hear *your* opinion on M4 vs. Cpp as well.

This is precisely what man pages lack: opinion.

Thanks a lot though,

Why do you keep asking this?  There is no 2.0.47, period, and there never
will be.  There's a CVS server at
:pserver:anonymous@cvs.hpc.uh.edu:/home/cvs/fvwm (the password is 'guest')
and testing releases in the the testing subdirectory of version-2 on the
FTP site, but if you want to play with development stuff you should join
fvwm-workers.

Maybe you have been thinking whats in the man pages are facts?

In general, M4  is more capable, but  not as familiar (to some people)
as Cpp.  "man m4" should make that clear.

 Hi,

I have installed a fresh copy of FVWM2.  It doesn't recognize some of the
commands in my .fvwm2rc file.  The unrecognized commands are:

    AddTitleStyle
    BorderStyle
    MiniIcon in the Style command

Any idea what is wrong?

Thanks,

- Alan

I think the main (pretty trivial) reasons I went with M4 were:

1. CPP would have required me to change all my comments from
   # ... to /* ... */.

2. CPP would require \ escapes for all newlines in macros, whereas M4 doesn't.


e.g. I do stuff like this:

m4_define(DECOR, `AddToDecor $1
+ WindowFont WINDOWFONT
+ HilightColor Yellow $2

+ BorderStyle Active (Solid $2)
+ BorderStyle InActive (Solid $3 -- HiddenHandles)

+ TitleStyle RightJustified
+ TitleStyle Inactive   (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ TitleStyle ActiveUp   (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ TitleStyle ActiveDown (VGradient 32 Black $3 -- Flat)

+ ButtonStyle All Simple
+ ButtonStyle All InActive (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ ButtonStyle All ActiveDown (VGradient 32 Black $3 -- Flat)

+ AddButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp (MiniIcon)
+ AddButtonStyle 2 InActive (MiniIcon)
+ AddButtonStyle 2 ActiveDown (Pixmap mini-exp.xpm)
')

DECOR(editor, EDITOR_COLOUR, LightGoldenRod)
DECOR(xterm, XTERM_COLOUR, Cyan)


In general M4 is more flexible, but for most simple macros that may not
be much of an issue.

I personally prefer the CPP syntax, but M4 allows me to run external
programs or scripts as part of it's pre-processing.  I am not aware of 
a way that would allow me to do that in CPP.

For example, I have this macro which checks the existence of a program
(1st argument).  If it exists, it expands to the 2nd argument,
otherwise it expands to a comment.  This is very useful if you want to
use the same fvwm config file on a number of different machines.

m4_define({INST_EXISTING},{m4_dnl
m4_syscmd(test -x $1)m4_dnl
m4_ifelse(m4_sysval,0,{$2},{{\#} "$1" does not exist or is not executable})})m4_dnl

AddToMenu Clients-Popup	"Clients"	Title
INST_EXISTING({xemacs},{+ "XEmacs%mini-xemacs.xpm%" Exec xemacs})

The only thing that bugs me a bit is that M4 preprocessing is slow.
It actually seems to be significantly slower when run under fvwm2 as
compared to running it straight from the command line.

Does anyone know of a patch to put normal window titlebars on fvwm2 menus?
Maybe I am being a bit perfectionistic about this, but it would be nice if I
could get the menus to fit in with everything else a bit more.

And while I'm asking silly questions, anyone know how to make the menus
appear "flat"? The whole threedy thing is so 1995.

I'm using 2.1.0, in case that matters.

Was it a binary package of fvwm2 you installed? fvwm2 has the option to omit
many features at compile time, to save space. I have heard that the stock
RedHat fvwm2 has had feature trimming that could cause these errors. I am
afraid your only recourse is either to install a full-featured fvwm2 or stop
using those features.

Scenario:
	I startx with a large virtual desktop (5 3x3 desks).
I have a preferred configuration for the desktop - netscape
in one area, doc stuff in another, programming stuff in another,
etc. I can start xterm in any desk I want with
xterm -xrm "*Desk:n".

Question: 
	How do I select which page (desk grid #) to start
a program in?

I looked thru the docs, FAQs, deja news, some archives, etc.
but have not found the magic command if it exists.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

	Specifying the page to start on is not currently supported by
FVWM, but it's coming soon.

	You have two options. If you're using 2.0.46, and are feeling
adventurous, you can grab the StartsOnPage patch from

	http://www.pcnet.com/~proteus/Fvwm/FvwmPAtches.html

Or, you can wait a bit (not too long, I hope) till the next release is
announced. The StartsOnPage style will be in that release.

	If you apply the patch, there are a couple of things you must
do. You must also apply the DontFocusOffscreen patch (available from
the same location, and also included in the next release), and you must
add the following command to your .fvwm2rc:

	StartsOnPageModifiesUSPosition

(This command will not be needed in the formal release; in fact, it
won't be recognized, and FVWM will whine about it.)

	The StartsOnPage style is like a superset of StartsOnDesk. Its
syntax is 

	Style "SomeApp*" StartsOnPage d x y

where d = the desk, and x and y are the x.y positions in the desktop
grid.

	For ad hoc page assignment, the -xrm technique is also recognized.
Following your example, 

	xterm -xrm "*Page:2 2 1"

would start your xterm on the page in the third column, second row of
the third desktop grid.

I don't think there is such a patch. If it were I'd certainly know
of it since I've rewritten large parts of the menu code (speaking of
2.1.0 of course).

Not possible either (at least for now).

: Question: 
: 	How do I select which page (desk grid #) to start
: a program in?

You can always specify -geometry in the command line of the app being called; 
for example, my Sun desktop is 1152x900, so the command line:

xterm -geometry +1152+0

gives me an xterm in the upper-left-hand corner of the page to the right of my 
start page.

hope this helps...

Neat trick :-) Unfortunately not all applications accept this as I learned
when trying to put xclock and FvwmPager off-screen before they are 
swallowed by FvwmButtons.

: Neat trick :-) Unfortunately not all applications accept this as I learned
: when trying to put xclock and FvwmPager off-screen before they are 
: swallowed by FvwmButtons.

my xclock accepts -geometry... but results may vary by unix flavor, obviously. 
 I run Solaris 2.5.1 & Redhat 5.0.

FvwmPager uses the *FvwmPagerGeometry setting to locate itself initially...

*FvwmPagerGeometry +2000+2000

works nicely to get it off your screen until it's swallowed.  Unfortunately, 
if you want to bring up another pager later for some reason, or FvwmButtons 
fails, you can't get to it (especially if you have WindowListSkip enabled for 
FvwmPager, as I do).

have fun...

Mine does too but refuses to be put off-screen (or perhaps it's a flaw
in fvwm).

Didn't work for me. What fvwm release do you use?

Seems like Lycos has f***ed up ftpsearch.ntnu.no

Can anybody point me to an ftp address or URL where I can download

	Hello fvwm users.
	I'm coming from Fvwm Home page and it has not been updated since may 
1998. Is the wm dead ? It would be very sad, I'm using it every day on my linux 
box and it's a very good software.

Its  far  from dead.   Expect  news soon.   I don't  have  a date, but
recently a lot of work has gone into the project, and the results will
be available when they are ready.

We can always use people who like to update web pages, if you're
volunteering.

FV> Is the wm dead ?

I don't think you could say so, given the enormous amount of work that's
gone into it over the last few weeks.  The testing releases are on the FTP
site if you want to look at them.

I have procured a dedicated machine to serve up FVWM info, which will be
going online soon (perhaps today if I can figure out name-based virtual
hosting) with updated web pages.  The fvwm-workers list is very active.
The CVS tree is available for anonymous access (more info if you need it)
and I hope to have anonymous rsync running soon as well.

Good things are happening.  The software is by no means dead.

The AutoHide feature of the fvmw2 TaskBar (used, e.g., in AnotherLevel) does
not work well; more bluntly, I'd say it's BROKEN. Can anyone at fvwm2 or
RedHat fix it or tell us how to patch it?

I'm using fvwm2-2.0.46 as it comes with RedHatLinux 5.2.
As far as my experiments can tell, AutoHide behaves differently in the top,
middle, and bottom panes of a desktop (and because of this, it took me a
while to characterize its behavior). For simplicity, assume you have a 1x3
desktop
    -----
    | 1 |
    -----
    | 2 |
    -----
    | 3 |
    -----
(but my comments apply to any vertical number of panes, and in this case
1 stands for the top pane, 3 for the bottom one, and 2 stands for all the panes
in between)

Well, AutoHide works well in pane one, UNTIL you manage to cross, with the
mouse, the boundary between panes 1 and 2; then, when you come back to 1, the
taskbar remains stuck in the hidden position.

In pane 2, the taskbar always remains hidden.

In pane 3 (the bottom pane, or the only pane in a 1x1 desktop), the taskbar
pops up and down all right, but when it pops down it hides only 2/5 of the
way, so that most of it still sticks out.

So, in none of the three cases is the AutoHide feature worth its name.

A working AutoHide would be a very useful features especially with small
screens. The powers that be, please take a look at it and make it work.
If, on the other hand, I'm being extremely dense and the feature can
be made to work, please show me how.

As far as I kown, it's fvwm2's issue. Some of them still remain in the
current fvwm CVS tree. If you have the source code, check the function
RaiseWindow(FvwmWindow *t) in the file fvwm/misc.c: the last line reads

void RaiseWindow(FvwmWindow *t)
{
  ...
  raisePanFrames();
}

The PanFrames are used to eat out all the events when the pointer get to the
edge of the screen. If an application window is bigger than the screen, and
the pointer enters one of these unvisibel PanFrames windows, fvwm will scroll
the screen so other part of that application window can be shown on the screen.
In early days, people tend to use bigger virtual desk top, say 1024x768,
than the actual desk top resolution, say 800x640, this scrolling feature
was pretty good. Or similarly, it can be used to switch to another desk top
without click on the pager. This is the reason why the TaskBar always hides
in the pane 2, because it will never get a chance to be raised up after
those PanFrames.

Another problem is cause by the function move_Loop() in the file fvwm/move.c
(maybe in another procedure). It will adjust those way-out-of-edge windows
back to screen. You can do a simple test by drag any application window
to the edge and hide it as much as you can in pane 3, it will behave the same,
and TaskBar is one of the application windows.

Surely there are workarounds, like rasing those Always-on-top windows after
PanFrames windows. But those workarounds may cause some side effects to
other modules. The fvwm maintainer should be informed.

	Ok, that's a good news, thanks to all of you who answer my question.
	And, guys, I didn't mean to hurt you by using the word "dead". We hear 
more and more about KDE, Gnome and other things like that which are far away 
from a light wm, i was afraid fvwm could have be abandonned.

Hi, Recently I switched to linux redhat  5.1 and fvwm (from
MS-NT4). I downloaded  rebuilt  fvwm2 and found  new [Alt-tab]
more different than in 5.1. I have a couple of questions.

I looked at fvwm:builtin.c:NextFunc() but couldn't get it to
wrap back to first window in  taskbar; why is circulate() so
complicated - any doc will be helpful.

Another  thing  I wanted to try  was  autoraise a window, (I
don't like clicking mouse at all),  by moving the mouse over
in the taskbar. I couldn't find any references to 'Ballons'.
Ballons work and are listed in my .fvwm2rc.

Also, gnu emacs came with emacs.xbm, using xv, I converted
it into emacs.xpm, yet it won't show up on the taskbar.

So how do I see all the debug/error messages? How do I run
fvwm2 under a debugger? 

Any help/pointer/docs will be appreciated. 

thanks,

Mohsin.

I added a new feature to Fvwm2.0.46/extras/FvwmTaskBar/FvwmTaskBar.c,
whereby keeping the cursor on a button in taskbar raises the window,
if tip is open (should be independent ideally).

BTW, I don't know X so well, but ideally I am looking at taskbar
taking keyboard input. Let me know if you have any suggestions,
eg. left / Right arrow in TaskBar can move between windows.

- Mohsin.

In ~/.fvwm2rc turn on the option by:
*FvwmTaskBarAutoFocus
*FvwmTaskBarShowTips

$ cd Fvwm2.0.46/extras/FvwmTaskBar
$ diff FvwmTaskBar.c-orig FvwmTaskBar.c

You should probably send your additions to the fvwm-workers list.  You
might also want to make sure it applies against the current development
version, available from the testing directory on the FTP site.

Also, please make sure to send a diff with some context; as you sent it, it
can't be applied automatically as it shows only the changes and not any of
the surrounding code.  Try using diff -u or diff -c; either of those will
generate something that the 'patch' program can apply.

        Hello.
        So, I got and tried 2.0.46.  (I got 2.1.1 also but my download
failed, so I couldn't try it :-).  All work fine, except FvwmWinList which
seems to fail with its  default  behavior  of centering icon names and
anchor'ing the windows. Did I missed something ?

Using the following .fvwm2rc configuration, all the keys perform as 
expected except for the Left Arrow.  No leftward motion whatsoever 
from anywhere is possible. ???

Key Left   A   C3   CursorMove -10 +0 
Key Right  A   C3   CursorMove +10 +0 
Key Up	   A   C3   CursorMove +0 -10 
Key Down   A   C3   CursorMove +0 +10 

They all function correctly with just the 3 modifier, or just the C
modifier, of if I use SC instead of C3.  And, it remains broken if I
put the Key Right configuration above the Key Left, for example.  The
3 represents a Mode_switch placed at the Caps_Lock key, in attempt to
replicate in Xfree86 the GNU/linux Hypermap.m4 keyboard configuration.
Interesting possibilities there are, such a big and normally underused 
key that Caps_lock!

System is GNU/Linux i586 2.0.36, Xfree86 version 3.3.2.3a-7.deb, S3 
server.

How do I change the default sounds on my desktop to ones the I would
prefer (That bounceing sound is irratating) and I also what to change
the Background picture to one I used in M$ Windows?? If I remeber right
there is a file somewhere that has all this set, but I cannot remeber
where it is or what name it is or even if there is another way to change
all this

That depends on how the sounds are generated. If you are using
FvwmAudio or FvwmEvents the configuration should be in your
.fvwm2rc file (maybe the system-wide file). See the manpages for
this modules for details.

You can do that quite a few ways. You may find that in .fvwm2rc or
perhaps xinitrc (/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit on my system) or in ~/.xinitrc.
The background image may be set by FvwmBanner (see manpage) or perhaps
by xsetroot, xpmroot or xv.

Are there any tricks to getting FvwmAudio to load? I run fvwm2 with
-debug and see no errors after the 

  Module FvwmAudio 

is processed, but nothing seems to work. ps shows various other Fvwm
modules running, but not FvwmAudio, so I assume it isn't really loading.
Is there any way beyond -debug to get more debug information (like why
it isn't loading)? This is a RedHat Linux 5.2 system (with
AnotherLevel).

What I want to do is launch a program from an FvwmButton such that it
will have the input focus without my having to move the mouse over it.
Is that possible?

Thanks.

This problem is caused by wanting to distribute a fvwm2rc alone,
without any additional files, to people with no unix skills (yet)
and only a basic setup including XFree86 and the contrib programs.
I can't use any additional scripts or install more untilities.

I want to be able to run commandline stuff from a menu, and have the
xterm remain for viewing output. For example, ping works nicely until
it is terminated, then the xterm disappears before you can see the
summary. I solved this for ping by setting the number of pings and
redirecting the output to xmessage.

It's not so easy for other programs, especially those that require
user input. xmessage won't display until the end of the output, and
xterm disappears the instant it believes there's nothing more to do.

For example, I'd like to be able to su and run a command with
parameters as root, and view the output before the xterm quits. The
obvious solution would be to call a script, but I can't provide them
with a second file. I tried various types of quoting and using the
shell command 'read' to pause, but all attempts either produced an
xterm saying "can't execvp" or did absolutely nothing. Is there any
way around this?

If these things cannot be done without an extra file, I'll just leave
them out, but if it is possible I'd really like to know.

TIA

Hello Bradley,

Make the mouse focus "sloppy". When you start a program the focus
will be on the window, unless the mouse is on a different window.

So when you click on the icon, move the cursor off of the icon onto
the background before the program comes up.

HTH,
Paul

Hi

I am having problems with FvwmIconMan. None of the actions that I specify for 
FvwmIconMan seems to work. All that happens on a mouse click is Iconify, 
irrespective of which button is clicked. I even tried the same configuration 
for FvwmIconMan as in the manual page on http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm, but still 
had the same problems. Then all of a sudden, I get a bunch of errors on my 
screen (yuk!!) about not finding the command gotobutton and all the other 
commands for FvwmIconMan. What am I missing here?

The config for FvwmIconMan is the same as on the web page, so if the web page 
is not right or there have been some changes, could someone point me in the 
right direction. fvwm2 -version gives me

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.0.45 compiled on Jul  8 1997 at 07:46:30

If my version is not right, please inform me about that too so I can inform 
the sysadmin.

Thanx a lot in advance. I really appreciate any help in using this brilliant 
WM.

Kaarthik

I don't understand why you can't include just one more file, but I'll
accept your statement that you can't. Given that constraint, how about
creating a script on the fly using a series of commands in the fvwm2rc?
You could probably even build a program in a high level language (line
by line), compile, link, execute and delete it when you're done. All
from within fvwm2rc. This is an old trick which I first saw as a way of
getting a build date compiled into a program.

Hello,

I have the evrsion of Fvwm that came with Red Hat 5.1 installed, version 
2.0.46 I think.

I have 2 xterms open. I did not fiddle around with my .fvwmrc file.
I left myself logged in and left the room. When I came back I realized
that xterm responded to mouse clicks (I guess that's really GPM) and
Fwm responded to mouse focus: I can move the pointer and the color of
window framse changes. however I cannot raise and move windows any more 
by clicking on the frames.

I think this is a bug in Fvwm. What else could it be? It has happened to
me before (except that before the mouse pointer didn't even move).
Most of the time, I had netscape running when everything froze, but this 
time everything works except for window operations.

Strange eh?

I guess I'll just have to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and reboot.

Best Regards,

Neil
