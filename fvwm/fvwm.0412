I'm in the process of upgrading an old Linux system.  On the old system, 
the window manager was
started by a .xinitrc file which started up xbiff, xclock, some xterms, 
etc, and then finally ran the window
manager. 

I just installed a Debian linux version, and as far as I can tell, there 
is no script analagous to .xinitrc that
gets executed unless I disable the automatic window manager selection in 
the session manager.  The
session manager has a system where you pick your window manager off a 
menu and it runs it. 
It only runs .xsession if it can't find your window manager.  It would 
appear, therefore, that the only
way to get startup applications run is to have fvwm start them. 

When I look at the fvwm manual I find a description of InitFunction, 
which sounds like the right
thing.  And the description says "These functions may be customized in a 
user's /.fvwm2rc/ file via
the *AddToFunc* command (described later) to start up modules, xterms, 
or whatever you'd like to
have started by fvwm.."  Sounds great.  But I'm using a session manager 
and a little farther down
I find "If fvwm is run under a session manager, functions 
*SessionInitFunction* and *
SessionRestartFunction* are executed instead of InitFunction and 
RestartFunction." 
Ok.  Whatever.  But then I encounter the vague warning:

Generally it is a bad idea to start xterms or other applications in 
"Session*" functions

And that's it.  There is no further explanation of either why it's bad 
idea or how, in fact, I'm
supposed to start up my xterms if I can't use SessionInitFunction to do 
it. 

Note: please CC me when you reply as I am not on the list.

I hate session managers.

Do man inittab.

Change from runlevel 5 to runlevel 3 and your life will be
greatly simplified.

Actually, that's entirely inaccurate. Debian doesn't use the RH-ism of
reserving runlevel 3 for non-GUI and runlevel 5 for GUI. In debian
runlevels 2->5 inclusive will launch some form of DM, if it is
installed.

To answer the querent directly, what you probably want to do, is:

update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
update-alternatives --config x-window-manager

This will change it globally, and x-session-manager takes precedence
over x-window-manager unless it is configured by the user. This depends,
of course, as to which display manager you use. KDM and GDM AFAIK have
to be coerced into using ~/.xsession (which is where you place all of
your commands to start up, including the session manager). XDM and
startx use ~/.xsession by default.

I tried .xsession before mailing the list.  As noted below, all the evidence 
suggests that .xsession will not be executed if the display manager finds a 
window manager to start up.

The file init.hook does not appear to be mentioned in the fvwm documentation.  I searched
for on with google and did find a reference wherein somebody reads this file with 
InitFunction in the .fvwm2rc file.

Reading [1] was actually very enlightening as it cleared up a 
fundamental confusion I
suffered from.  I don't want a session manager!  (My desktop gets more 
and more
cluttered until I finally log out and start fresh.  A session manager to 
preserve the clutter
is not what I need.)  I was thinking that the display manager was the 
session manager. 
Of course it makes sense that you wouldn't want to start up a bunch of 
apps if you were
using a session manager since presumably the session management is going 
to be starting
up the saved session.

Right now KDM is installed.  There is an elaborate script system with 
scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d
(I think) which resembles the rc.d startup scripts.  The scripts are 
numbered and run in order, and one
of these scripts will run the user .xsession file but only if a window 
manager wasn't already started by
a previous script.  I could insert a script in this sequence to force 
the system to run a user .xsession
file (or modify the existing script to always run that file).  But I 
guess I presumed there was a more
natural way to do it.  I don't know what program is responsible for 
running all of these xsession scripts.
The current setup where the display manager gives a menu of window 
managers and it is possible to
select Gnome or KDE may be useful to me for some other occasional users 
of the system. 
I'll look into update-alternatives.  It's not obvious what the effect of 
designating a window manager
would be for the current setup where there is a menu of several.  

I don't have access right now to the system in question, so I can't test 
anything out, but it appears
that I should be able to avoid using a session manager and to use the 
InitFunction command in the
.fvwm2rc file to start whatever stuff I want, either directly or through 
loading a file such as the
init.hook file mentioned above.  Is this the right approach?   Or is it 
preferable to arrange somehow
that the user .xsession file gets executed (before?) the window manager 
is started.

This is wholly inaccurate. You have to tell ~/.xsession what it is to
do. Again, see [2].

You need to read the scripts in more detail. ~/.xsession takes
precedence over /etc/X11/Xsession.d/* should it exist. This has always
been the case. Again, see [2,3].

You can do it both ways. The only advantage of putting them in
~/.xsession rather than allowing fvwm to start them is because the apps
in ~/.xsession persist across different window managers / desktop
environments, should you ever change them.

I'm not sure what you mean by "have to tell ~/.xsession what it is to 
do".  My observations of
the actual behavior my system is that it didn't matter if the file was 
called ~/.xsession, ~/.Xsession
or ~/.xinitrc.  In all cases the contents of the file were NOT executed 
unless I explicitly ran it
after fvwm started up.  I'm not sure how to reconcile this observation 
with the
claim above.  The file does have execute permission.  Item [2] talks 
about using startx and
hence doesn't apply to my (current) setup where kdm is used.

Those references seem to indicate that some display managers do not, in 
fact, run the ~/.xsession,
though kdm wasn't explicitly mentioned.  As an example that people 
typically find that kdm does
not run ~/.xsession I note 
http://neon.polkaroo.net/~mhoye/blarg/archives/001645.php where
somebody pursues the other solution I had noted above of adding stuff to 
/etc/X11/Xsession.d. 

I'm a little hazy on what exactly would be responsible for running 
~/.xsession in the quoted
situation described above.  On my system there exists (I think) a 
/etc/X11/Xsession which
doesn't look in ~.   Then there is /etc/X11/Xsession.d/* which has something
like 5 scripts in it.  One of them checks whether a window manager was 
selected and if not,
looks for ~/.xsession and runs it if it exists.  This would be an odd 
thing to do if ~/.xsession
was run instead of /etc/X11/Xsession.d/*, since then ~/.xsession would 
not exist if the
/etc/X11/Xsession.d/* files were being executed. 

It would appear therefore that I have four possible avenues, which I 
summarize here for
the archives:
1. Add something to /etc/X11/Xsession.d
2. Use InitFunction in the ~/.fvwm2rc
3. Use startx or maybe xdm instead of kdm so that ~/.xsession is used to 
control window manager,
    and perhaps combine this with wmselect if I want to select between 
different window managers
4. Use the "default" setting (?) on kdm which causes ~/.xsession to be used

It seems to me that this is getting somewhat off topic for a list 
devoted to fvwm, so I have
set the reply-to in an effort to take further discussion (should any 
occur) off the list.
Thanks to those who took the time to reply to my query.

Hello,
what should I do to change the inactive window colors?
It has a dull black that I don' t know where it is coming from. I copuy 
the parts of .fvwm2rc I find relevant:
<
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg rgb:00/00/bb, bg rgb:ff/88/00
# ??? bg window??
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg pink, bg pink, hl pink, sh pinik
#fore window font, bg, hl sh
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 2 fg rgb:88/88/bb, bg rgb:00/32/6d

#(...)

# run FvwmTheme before anything else is done
ModuleSynchronous Timeout 5 FvwmTheme
#general setup
Style * Colorset 1
Style * HilightColorset 2
 >
And there is a screenshot at http://dedeco.altervista.org/shot.jpg

I use FVWM:
fvwm 2.5.7 compiled on Sep 23 2003 at 23:03:38
with support for: ReadLine, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Bidi

I think you need to use ~/.xsession instead of .xinitrc (not sure) and then you
choose default window manager and it should run /etc/X11/Xsession which looks
for ~/.xsession. Works for me with wdm at least IIRC also KDM but haven't used
it for a while.

Hi,

I would like to have a keystroke that will move the window under focus to an 
adjacent page.  Any suggestions appreciated!

I'm using fvwm 2.5.12-4


Thanks,

Matthew

the function

will move the focused window left one page and up zero pages

following http://incubator.vislab.usyd.edu.au/roller/page/Steve/20040909,

i compiled X.org for transparency.


works great ;

(on a side note : with the xcompmngr, i can't switch from page to page ;
only with moving the mouse to the side of the screen,
my keyboard shortcut is somehow disabled.
(anyone experienced this ?))

however, transset does not support windowid as arg,
and it would be nice to have this function
included in fvwm. 

is there any plan to do that ?

thanks.

bye

I know of at least one other person looking at this but neither of us
has got it fully working yet.
I've managed to get FVWM to find/run using 32-bit ARGB visuals but sadly
time has stopped me from getting any further.

I'm using some window movements from tavisos config:
#####
# Name:     PackWindowUp
# Bound:    Alt+Shift+Up When a window is active
# Purpose:  Interrogate all windows on the current page, find the window
with an edge
#           closest to active window, and slide the Active window upto
that edge, or
#           the Page edge, if no window is in the way.
#
#           The Wrappers are required to look after the Context while
we're testing
#           windows. Could also do it with a load of variables, but this
is nicer.
#
#           See PackWindowLeft for a description of the logic (i know it
looks a little
#           cryptic).
#
#           Sometimes terminals seem to need WindowRefresh, but 99% of
the time it just
#           works, it creates a little flicker so I'll leave it out
until it starts to bug
#           me.
#
#           Windows are also Raised, you can disable this.

I wrote the following function that I use for moving windows. It moves
the window and then changes to that page; you'd be surprised, but it
makes life a lot easier, especially if you're moving it more than one
screen.


DestroyFunc SendToPage
AddToFunc SendToPage
+                               "I" moveToPage $0 $1
+                               "I" goToPage $0 $1


My key mappings to invoke this are as follows:

#   Shift + Meta + <direction> to move an application between pages
      Key   Left    A   SM  SendToPage -1p 0p
      Key   Right   A   SM  SendToPage +1p 0p
      Key   Up      A   SM  SendToPage 0p -1p
      Key   Down    A   SM  SendToPage 0p +1p


Hope this helps!

Hi All

This is what I have:
FVWM 2.5.12-4
xfree86-common 4.3.0.dfsg.1-8
Debian/unstable (ppc)
Kernel 2.4.25-ben1

I'm trying to change the background color of tooltips, balloons as
they're called, IINM on FVWM and elsewhere, popping up when I move the
mouse over a browser window, the Buttons Bar etc. ... with only
very limited success so far:

I was able to change the Buttons Bar tooltips background color with
*FvwmPagerPager: BalloonBack #dcdbe3

But I'd like to set it for all programs: some sort of wildcard along
the line of
* BalloonBack #dcdbe3

I suspect this is not something I can change in the FVWM configs but
via my xfree settings (.Xresources, .Xdefaults?) .. but I'm not sure
about it.

I put new values to the .Xresources file (Excerpt):

---------------------------------------------------
! widget to turn on/off the balloon messages
Fig*msg_form.balloon_toggle*shadowWidth: 2
Fig*msg_form.balloon_toggle.topShadowContrast: 	-40	
Fig*msg_form.balloon_toggle.bottomShadowContrast: -10

! balloon for current filename window
Fig.filename_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.filename_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

! balloon for balloon message window
Fig.toggle_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.toggle_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

!balloon describing drawing/editing mode function
Fig.mode_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.mode_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

!balloon describing indicator panel function
Fig.ind_balloon_popup*Label.background:		gray85
Fig.ind_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:		blue

!balloon describing command panel button function
Fig.cmd_balloon_popup*Label.background:		gray85
Fig.cmd_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:		blue

!balloon describing unit function
Fig.unit_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.unit_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

!balloon describing mouse function
Fig.mouse_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.mouse_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

! balloon for depth panel
Fig.layer_balloon_popup*Label.background:	gray85
Fig.layer_balloon_popup*Label.foreground:	blue

Fig*Text*background: 			gray60

-------------------------------------------------------
I lifted the code above from a file in 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/

But the code above didn't change the balloon colors so far ..

Any hint?
A man page? Some documentation, somewhere ... ?

Thanks in anticipation ..

Best Regards

w.

Hi all.

Is it at all possible to create new placement policies in fvwm2rc? I would like to implement a placement policy which places new windows directly under the mouse cursor. I realize that this has been attempted before with a patch (thread here: http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0408/msg00282.html), but unfortunately nobody ported it forward to newer versions and it never made it into fwvm. 

This feature is found in other window managers (enlightenment, openbox, etc.) but there seems to be no easy way to do it in fvwm. 

Thanks,
c

As far as I know X11 doesn't have any concept of tooltips, so every UI 
programmer is obliged to roll his/her own.  Therefore there's no 
standard for what they're called, or whether they have a separate 
background resource at all.  Applications written with a particular 
toolkit sush as Gtk may be different - I don't know.

If you're desperate to find the resources for a given app, you can run 
"strings" on the executable and try to guess what's what.  I've had 
occasional, limited success with that strategy.

Hi,

I've been using fvwm for last one month & the capability is amazing.
So why not try this...

I'm using FvwmTaskBar and here is what I'm trying to do (click means
left click):

1. First click on the taskbar icon for open window(say w1), raises
& focuses the window. 
2. One more click on the same icon, iconifies it.
3. Now I click on icon of some other window (say w2) for some other
work, so the focus is moved. 
4. Finally once my work is over, I want to click on the icon of w1
(which is iconified) & I want it to be de-iconified, raised & focused.

Currently I have to click once on the icon of w1 (which transfers the
focus) and then another click raises & focuses it.

Parts from my .fvwmrc are:

<snip>

DestroyFunc RaiseAndFocus
AddToFunc   RaiseAndFocus
   + I      Focus
   + I      Raise

DestroyFunc TaskBarIconOper
AddToFunc   TaskBarIconOper
    + I     ThisWindow (Focused) Iconify toggle
    + I     RaiseAndFocus

</snip>

The left mouse button is configured as:

<snip>
Style    FvwmTaskBar    NoTitle, StaysOnTop, Sticky, \
                    CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip, \
                    !Borders, NoHandles

*FvwmTaskBar:   Action Click1 TaskBarIconOper

</snip>

The second button of my mouse doesn't work particularly well & I dont
want to buy a new mouse... :-)

Gtk calls them tooltips. The following works for me

style "tooltips"
{
fg[NORMAL] = "#000000"
bg[NORMAL] = "#fcf7bd"
}
widget "*tooltips*" style "tooltips"

I put this in ~/.gtkrc.mine which is included from ~./.gtkrc and
~/.gtkrc-2.0

May it be possible to consider the following functionality, create
a mapping key function to launch main program (the most used) ?
exemple in .fvwm2rc:

map <F1> /usr/bin/my_browser_web

Thank you,
MJ

I made a very simple (ruby) script that shows the number of new mails I
have. The scripts simply writes to stdout.

I could use piperead to get this text into a button, but then it
doesn't refresh. 

It would also be nice if I could place text in multiple colors.

What is the best way to do this? Should I use FvwmScript for
this or is there a easier way?

Yes, I too have such a script in Ruby, but then I realised that
reinventing the wheel is better left to others. So I now use a program
called Xlassie, available here:

http://www.speakeasy.org/~xyzzy/xlassie/

I have this swallowed in FvwmButtons, and works wonders.

Already there,  You're looking for the Key command:

Back when I used the MS Internet keyboard, this tied the HomePage button
directly to Netscape:

Key XF86HomePage  A  A  Exec /usr/local/bin/netscape

Basically, regardless of where the focus is or what modifiers apply,
that key would kick off Netscape.

Nowadays, I'd probably do something different, like using modifiers to
cause that key to kick off different browsers, like Firefox, Mozilla,
Netscape, Galeon . . .

Hi,

I'm using fvwm 2.5.9 on my Intel PIII 950 mhz with 2.4.22-1.2115.nptl
kernel (Fedora Core1).

Upon starting FVWM, the following error messages are sent to console:

<messages>
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> unknown style Font: Font               
       xft:Verdana:antialias=True:pixelsize=10_cdim: --- not moved
0x08138f78 'FvwmTaskBar'
</messages>

There is no problem in displaying the font. I have also tried changing
the font but this persists with _any_ font I use. Any ideas?

Regards,

Hi everyone,

I have a small problem with fvwm. XDMCP is enable on a linux computer
running fvwm windows manager. With Solaris, we start a Xnest connection
with a query to the linux computer.

I log and everything is fine except for a particular application. The
application "menu's item" are not there. I see the menu scrolling down
but the text is not there. Everything else is working, mouse click
(left, middle and right button).

There is no problem without Xnest. When I start a "X :1 -query
Linux_IP", everything is good.

I want to know if someone experienced something similar or not.

Thx.

I've created a simple panel for my applications.
This is an example line:

*PanelApps: (Icon gimp.xpm, Left, Title(Side) "gimp", \
            Action "Exec exec gimp")

This panel works fine, but it isn't width enough.
It seems like the width of the icon isn't added to the width of
the title. If I remove the icon it works fine.
Can I specify the width of the icon?
I can solve it by adding a couple of spaces or define a width for
the button, but this is not a very nice solution.

You could define Some Rows and Columns for the FvwmButtons, and use it
following way:
*PannelApps: (12x12, foo..)

Hiya 

have a problem at my friend's computer. I gave him all my fvwm-config, he
unpacked it into .fvwm (just as needed) and the user-rights are okay, too. 
If he loads fvwm (either via xterm within x or via the xdm-config-file) it gets
loaded but doesn't load the configs. There are some errors but the are more the
"cannot load pixmap..." - type than the critical one. 
Does anybody have any idea what the problem could be? Or can anybody give me a
hint where to look?

Regards, 

Julian

Hello,

After upgrading from SuSE 9.0 to SuSE 9.2 I get lots of messages like

_cdim: --- not moved 0x0827c180 'freshmeat.net: New releases - Mozilla'
_cdim: --- not moved 0x08280800 'FvwmWinList'

Is this something to worry about, or can it be ignored?

Kind Regards

Yep. Thanks. ... :) ... It helped: My ~/.gtkrc.mine (after having
removed the commented lines for the posting her):
---------------------------------------
style "gtk-tooltips-style" {
       bg[NORMAL] = "#d9d9d9"
}

widget "gtk-tooltips" style "gtk-tooltips-style"


style "gtk-default-iso-8859-15" {
       fontset = "-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--8-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1,\
                  -*-arial-medium-r-normal--8-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1,\
                  -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--8-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-15,\
                  -*-arial-medium-r-normal--8-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-15,*-r-*"
}
class "GtkWidget" style "gtk-default-iso-8859-15"

--------------------------------------------------
>

I only have a ~/.gtkrc-2.0, now ... IIRC there wasn't one before.

~/.gtkrc-2.0, here:

-----------------------
#include "/usr/share/themes/ThinGeramik/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
#include "/usr/share/themes/Default/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
gtk-theme-name = "Simple"
include "/home/shorty/.gtkrc.mine"
----------------------

What has happened above - and for me it came as a little surprise that
this is even possible - is that now I use FVWM together with a gtk-2.0
theme, IINM. I.e FVWM still is a non-FVWM-themes one here, but with this
little trick in ~/.gtkrc-2.0 it becomes some sort of gtk-2.0 enhanced
FVWM. And the gtk-2.0 theme is one of several others provided by a
Debian package called "gnome-themes".

I think I fine-tuned the whole thing a bit by adding these options to
some font-settings for fvwm:
minspace=True:rgba=rgb:antialias=True

font setting lines now look something along the line of this:
MenuStyle * font "xft:sans-serif:minspace=True:rgba=rgb:antialias=True:Medium:Arial:Roman:size=10"

What also helped a lot was starting the FVWM session with a 
startx -- -dpi 82
or something like that ..

This way I got small fonts, even *inside* program windows like Gimp,
Firefox etc. ... And non-big font sizes are an indispensable must for every
computer I use for more than 3 minutes ... :) 

I uploaded a screenshot of this jewel of a Windowmanager (be warned it
has more than 530 KB ... :) 
http://www.wolfgangpfeiffer.com/FVWM-gtk.2-theme.jpg

The menu bar fonts of Emacs (also seen on the screenshot) definitely
suck: This has been a catastrophe since the beginning after I
installed Debian here on this Apple machine ... This was a problem on
Gnome, too .. and it's not related to FVWM, IINM ...

My settings are definitely beginner stuff, not very cleverly
organized. Simply the result of my growing greed after some hours of
typing, trying and erroring.  

But the graphical quality of this, IINM, GTK-plugged FVWM can be compared
without any doubt to the quality Gnome-2.8/metacity/gdm are providing.
And it's good to know I don't have to go back to Gnome to see a nice
desktop view ... :) 

Thank you, Chris Rouch: You gave me the loose end to roll into the
first bits of FVWM/GTK knowledge.

My appreciation to all FVWM-workers out there. It seems to me you've
done an outstanding excellent job.

I don't think I understand the question.

Are you trying to say fvwm isn't reading $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc?

If you use a command line like this to start fvwm:

fvwm -f /tmp/config

Then thats the only config file fvwm will look for during startup.

Recent beta releases prefer to read $HOME/.fvwm/config.

Find out the release of fvwm, find out the command line
used to start fvwm then if you still have questions,
ask again.

Do these files in error messages actually exist on his system?

Did he build fvwm with the XPM and PNG support?

Does he have several fvwm installations? What does "fvwm -version" say?

Post the url to your ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc if you still have problems.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think that are just debug messages from fvwm. I'm not sure, but
I thought these are removed in the latest fvwm.

Are you using an older version?

I'm using the version delivered with SuSE 9.2:

rpm -q fvwm2
fvwm2-2.5.10-2

So it seems SuSE is delivering an unstable release with its
professional distribution?

The entire 2.5 branch are beta releases.
That's why you sometimes find debugging turned
on in one of the releases.

Fvwm is very rarely unstable, even with the beta releases.

If you are installing Fvwm for hundreds of users in a
corporate environment, I'd never recommend a 2.5 release.

If this is for your own use, don't worry about it.

I was asked to publish my .fvwm2rc. So I decided to pack some edited
editions of my ~/gtk configs, ~/fvwm files and some additional ~/X configs
into a tarball. They're available here:
<http://www.wolfgangpfeiffer.com/fvwm.pfeiffer.tar.gz>

Almost certainly there will be bugs in these configs. They work
here. But as one knows: The fact something works does not
necessarily mean it's right. So please make the usual backups before
running these configs.

HTH

I'm playing with my decor styles.  I have a gradient for the background of  
the title and a miniicon for button 1 (the only button I have).  What I  
want is for the button's background color to be the same as the first  
color of the gradient.  In my current setup, all I can do is set the  
button to the miniicon; I can't set the color.  If I use UseTitleStyle, I  
can get a gradient, but that doesn't look good.

	TitleStyle      Active (HGradient 64 blue2 black -- Flat)
	TitleStyle      Inactive (HGradient 64 grey51 black -- Flat)
	TitleStyle      LeftJustified

	#ButtonStyle     all     -- UseTitleStyle Flat
	ButtonStyle     all     Active (Solid blue2 -- Flat)
	ButtonStyle     all     Inactive (Solid grey51 -- Flat)
	ButtonStyle     1       MiniIcon -- Flat

Thanks,

Hi there,

I have a question regarding an application called skype,
which enables one to use your pc as a telephone via internet.
When skype starts up the main application is started but also
a little window is opened which contains nothing but a little
skype-related icon. This window can be found in the windowlist
and i have the feeling that there should be some better place
where this icon can be put to... Does someone know what this
window is ment for and is there a 'predefined way' to handle
this window. i have other applications showing similar
behaviour.

>From the FvwmIdent Module launched on the skype window

Name: skype
Icon Name: skype
Class: Skype

Transient: no

my fvwm is...

You could use a sys-tray programm. Like peksystray or some addons for
gnome-panel, xfce-panel, the kde panel has a notification area too.

you can swallow peksystray in a FvwmButtons bar.

You could put a special style on skypedoc which skips the windowlist.
But the systray programm is a better solution IMO.

This window is meant to go into the dockbar for kde or gnome (like the rectangle
with icons on the right of the windows task bar). There is a program called
docker, that may be able to swallow it.

Why doesn't fvwm get with the times? It's a great window manager, no
doubt, i've used it for years now, but I want more, and not measly fixes
and patches. The project is moving inescapably into its' irrelevant
eventuality. The problem with much software development is people see
the stars and go for it, forgetting the steps in between. In fvwm there
is an opportunity to leapfrog other window managers and embrace the 3D
desktop, but only by leveraging the window commands that it exposes. Not
the current theatrics of 3D, simply windows enabled in the 3rd dimension
through its exposed command set.

What do you mean? These "patches" are not measly in anyway. How else is
a project supposed to develop without them?

This is something which *might* happen in the future, but it depends on
the attitude of the developers (as to whether it is appropriate), and
indeed whether the users want it. 

If you're that hell-bent on 3D stuff, have a look at metisse[1] which is
based on Fvwm, and uses some of the features you're so desperate in
getting fvwm to support.

You need to use multiple button styles, but the "ButtonStyle"
command resets the old settings.  You need to use AddButtonStyle:

  buttonstyle all active (solid blue2 -- flat)
  buttonstyle all inactive (solid grey51 -- flat)
  addbuttonstyle 1 miniicon

Xnest does not behave like a conventional X server in so many ways
that I stopped debugging Xnest/fvwm problems a long time ago.  I
recommend to find a different way to connect the two machines or
ask the Xnest developers for a better idea.

There seems to be a syntax error in some configuration line,

It's a debug message you can safely ignore.

Hello devs, great work on fvwm.


	I was wondering what the future of shape masking in Fvwm will
	be. I've noticed a few things about it currently that don't sit
	well with me, and I wondered if anyone was still working on this
	portion of fvwm and of course, if they were willing to take some
	suggestions:

 1.   Shape masking doesn't work in title bars as of yet, although you
	can use pixmaps to shape yourself some rounded (or otherwise
	different) corners, if you don't use pixmaps you are left with
	no choices.

 2.  Shape masking ruins the effect borders have in Fvwm. Example: I
	make a shape mask for my menu and when I bring up the menu I
	have shaped	corners, the problem is, the border around the menu
	window is cut off where the shaping happens.  Will it ever be
	possible for the border to follow the contour of the shape mask?

Thanks in advance,
-Evan

Hi,

I am currently trying to configure fvwm (fvwm-crystal) for a Twinview setup 
using Nividia's drivers (1.0.6629) but i am running in to some problems:

1 When i enable Xinerama using:
$ Xinerama On
nothing really happens and new windows still appear in the center of the 2 
screens.

I Tried to resolve this using:
$ XineramaSlsSize 2x1
$ XineramaSls On
$ Xinerama On

This helps, when i maximize a window it will maximize within the same screen, 
the MoveToScreen command work etc. However new problems have surfaced:
1 mplayer window still spans 2 screens when i "fullscreen"
2 Games (HL2) show the same behaviour, the window spans the whole screen
3 (This is the weirdest), fvwm-crystal has some menu's that can be popped up 
by clicking an titlebar icon while pressing Alt, these menu's will now open 
on the primary screen, this is an problem when the window is on the secondary 
screen.
I have tried to resolve the menu issue by creating an Style:
$ Style * StartsOnScreen c
to have everything open in the screen where the cursor is but the effect is 
the opposite of what i want, although it does seem to have the expected 
behaviour it will now open every menu on "the other screen": request a menu 
on the primary and it opens on the secondary and the other way around!!?

My questions:
1. Is there a way to make windows Fullscreen in only one screen (like mplayer 
and HalfLife)?
2. What could be the reasong StartsOnScreen behaves this way ?
3. Why do i have to use XineramaSls in stead of just Xinerama On before i can 
use any Xinerama features.

Thanks,

Mark

Hi,

Thank you for your reply !

I guess i'll have to look into the meta modes thing in the driver README, as i 
have two identical tft screens i do not want to disable one of the 2 in 
1280x1024 and i do not want to play games in 1024 :-S

So XineramaSls is really the way to go as i thought it was not really the same 
after reading this part in the fvwm manpage:

"For  multi-screen  implementations  other than Xinerama, such as Single
Logical Screen, it is possible to simulate a Xinerama configuration  if
the  total  screen seen by fvwm is made up of equal sized monitors in a
rectangular grid.  The commands XineramaSls, XineramaSlsSize  and  Xin-
eramaSlsScreens are used to configure this feature."

I Will try the XineramaSlsScreens though to define the screens as I haven't 
done that yet, but i still have some doubts about this because I do not 
understand what would make the menu's popup in the wrong screen.
You do not use StartsOnScreen c but this should be default behaviour so it 
doesn't explain why A:
my menu's popup only on the primary screen with the default, and B:
my menu's popup on the opposite screen while defining StartsOnScreen c.

I'll try tonight and post my success/failure.

Mark.

I hadn't looked at the fvwm site for over six months, I don't need to, v
2.4.17 is still working for me since the last time i compiled it.
However when I visit the site again, there was little to inspire me. The
focus on cvs versions got me, I guess I wanted to see some vision.

It's just a reality. The undercurrents of change - the 3D desktop - are
breaking to the surface. Open your eyes and look around you. Fvwm has a
rich heritage, it would be nice to see it carried forward. I just looked
at metisse, and you are right, you know nothing and understand even
less, however karma points for any past involvement. Metisse is a play
on rendering, nothing to do with semantics. 

fvwm commands + semantics + current 3d desktops = vision for the future.

Reality is subjective.
When I look, what I see is a 2D monitor.

Oh, yes... Fvwm is going forward, but that does not mean it has to change
direction to achieve it. Adding in 3D support is not something that can
be done easily. Fvwm has always had a reputation for being light-weight,
and even to this day, with all the other bloated WMs and DEs out there,
it has remained so.

But it is a step into the direction you want, IMO. You will need to
clarify just what it is you're expecting, mind. Although quite frankly
your attitude to your approach needs to be re-thought. Right now, it
stinks.

Hi all,

I've been running fvwm on a linux Zaurus PDA and it's by far the best
window manager I've found for the platform despite the limitations of a
PDA (you can see screenshots of fvwm on Zaurus on this thread:
http://www.zaurususergroup.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8280&st=0 )

Can anyone suggest how to efficiently set up the use of Stroke for a
PDA? Stroke itself is working fine, but I have not found it very usable because: 

1) there is only really one button with the stylus so you can't simply 
overide that for the stroke commands. 
2) binding the stroke commands only on the root window is a bit
limiting, and you would have to get to the root window first.
3) using a modifier key means that you have to use the
keyboard, and if you're going to do that it's just as easy to bind a key
to the command than have to use both keys and stylus, also if the PDA
is open such that the keyboard is unaccessible then you lose the stroke
commands right when you need them most. 
4) There are some buttons on a reserved area of the screen that
you can tap with the stylus, so while using StrokeFunc NotStayPressed
looks promising, a button press will exit from the mode - so when 
you go to draw the stroke you're immediately exited from the StrokeFunc

The only things I can think of is some sort of command that flips to
another desktop for the stroke and then immediately flips back (not a
very good solution) or patching the StrokeFunc source so that the 
mode with NotStayPressed exits on a ButtonRelease event rather than 
ButtonPress event. Can someone who knows the source better give me some
pointers?

I think it would be an incredibly useful function on a PDA once it's
working 

thanks

Alexei

Hi there,

I have got fvwm running on a box which has to 2 monitors, 2
graphic cards and therefore 2 xserver running. Actually
there 2 instances of fvwm as well since there is not
cinerama support on this machine.

Restart of fvwm failes since the restarted instance sees
the second fvwm and reports that another window manager is
running. But an older fvwm version (2.2.x) can be started.
I guess that the "other window manger"-check is not
implmented in this version.

When I logon to this machine I get the 2 instances of fvwm
running but I cannot do a restart.

Any ideas? Could fvwm check if the "other window manager"
runs on a different display?

Cheers, Uwe

I see you use a taskbar, you could create a button on it that initiates
the stroke, for example:

*FvwmButtons: (2x20, Icon stroke.png, Frame 0, ActionOnPress, Action(Mouse 1) `StrokeFunc DrawMotion FeedBack`)

So, I am trying to setup something in my fvwm configuration and could 
really use some help.

The intention is to have an FvwmButtons instance that is south-shaded by 
default, and unshades only while I hold in the hot-key assigned to it. 
While unshaded, I should be able to interact normally with the window 
using the mouse. Using a hot-key to toggle the shade state of the window 
would work just as well.

I've been able to setup something similar using a small buttonbar 
instance and a transient panel, but it still requires interaction with 
the mouse to pop up and down the panel.

I've looked over the faq question on the subject and can't seem to 
figure out how to specify a function that targets a specific window. The 
examples all seem to assume that the mouse will be interacting with the 
window in question, which isn't the case here.

I also can see no way to bind a Key to a Button in FvwmButtons.

Thanks in advance,
Fred.

Hmmmm. Tricky. I believe Piotr did something similar a while back. See:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0403/msg00388.html

> Using a hot-key to toggle the shade state of the window

This is much easier to do. I use:

Key F12 A A All (Buttonbar) WindowShade S

Where "Buttonbar" is the name of my FvwmButtons instance. ie.

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmButtons Buttonbar

Hope that helps,

SCoTT. :)

(Damon, sorry to have emailed your personal account.)

If FVWM were moving towards some "irrelevant eventuality" I can't 
believe that it would be because of any features. Fluxbox and IceWM(1) 
seem to be very popular and both are clunky(2) and under-featured 
compared to FVWM. A lot of the reason is probably just trend/fad. 
Something as simple as a new webpage, nice default config, or slashdot 
article could bring in a ton of new users any day. The 3D stuff, paned 
windows, etc. are all nice, but not a fit for everyone, or (guessing) 
even a majority of people. IMO, for people like myself who spend 99% of 
computer time coding, the floating window interface is and will remain 
the best fit.

(1) I'm using IceWM myself at the moment, because of the lack of an 
acceptable (to me) default config in FVWM. Probably come back in the 
future (IceWM is not very tweakable) when I have time to set up FVWM. I 
switched to IceWM after a HD crash. I needed to gut "up and running" 
*quickly*. A nice thing about IceWM is that you can install it and get 
back to work instantly.

(2) The exception to this is the lack of "alt-tab" in FVWM. 
"Alt-tab-tab" is *very* clunky. A serious turn-off to my wife when I 
explained this to her.

I've never used gnome-panel before but it resists attempts to
iconify it, no matter how you invoke the iconify command.

I tried:

Style * GnomeIgnoreHints

but that didn't help.

I don't think it wants to be iconified.  If it has some
docs, you might want to check them.

Thank you for the advice, these will definitely help. I can't believe I
missed that "All (window)" bit while going over the docs, heh.
Information overload I guess. I tried it out and it seems to work great.

I'll go over that other post and see if I can't integrate the ideas
there into my config.

Thanks again,
Fred

Hello I have been experimenting with using a random background image and I
found a command that will do it. Unfortunatly it doesn't work in my
.fvwm2rc file. I was wondering if you could offer any helpful suggestions.
This is the command as it is used in my InitFunction:

+	"I" exec xv -root -max -quit bgpictures/bg$[RANDOM % 3 +1].jpg

Now it is supposed to pick between 3 jpg files each named bg1.jpg bg2.jpg
and bg3.jpg in the bgpictures directory. It works if I use this command in
my .bashrc file but not the .fvwm2rc file. I am certain it is because
fvwm doesn't recognize the $[RANDOM % 3 + 1] part but I would like to
know if their is a way I can get it to recognize it. If anyone can help me
that would be great.

Eric Coulthard

You can use:

ExecUseShell /bin/bash

or

+ "I" exec bash -c 'xv -root -max -quit bgpictures/bg$[RANDOM % 3 +1].jpg'


But I predict 3 pictures won't be enough.
I started with 1 and a few years later I have 1056.

Thanks for that suggestion. It sort-of works - I can initiate a 
stroke provided it starts at the button. This really limits the possible
strokes though. Also often the stroke seems to get stuck and doesn't respond
to the ButtonRelease event (I'm not sure why this is).

The limitation is the stylus, because you can't just move the cursor.
You have to first make contact with the screen (and this generates a
ButtonPress event) and then drag the cursor.

So for instance using StrokeFunc NotStayPressed, I could tap one of the 
onscreen buttons generating a key bound to that command - up to here
it's OKi, and I enter the stroke mode. but then when I go to do the stroke 
this first generates a ButtonPress event as I contact the screen, 
which immediately exits me from the Stroke mode.... I can't see how to
get around this without hacking the source.

One solution which I'm using at the moment is to bind a button to
iconifying all the windows and then bind stroke commands to the root
window. This means I lose the root window for anything else though.

cheers,

Alexei

You may want to try xv's "-random" option instead, as in:

xv -root -max -quit -random bgpictures/bg*.jpg

I am not sure how the wildcard "*" will be handled from within fvwm.
You may need to experiment a bit.

Dear All,

>From reading the man page, I believe that WarpToWindow should not
raise the window in question.  However, when I use WarpToWindow it
does raise the window. So
a) did I missread the man page?
b) is there some way to not raise the window?
I am using FVWM version 2.4.19

The following .fvwm2rc is sufficient to produce the behavior

AddToFunc Set-Reference
        + I Piperead 'echo "Setenv $0_Id  $[w.id]"'
AddToFunc Goto-Reference
        + I Piperead "echo 'WindowId $$$$[$0_Id] WarpToWindow 50 50'"
Key 1           W       MS      Set-Reference 1
Key 1           A       M       Goto-Reference 1

In the FvwmWiki, you can find a Lisp-Script that picks a random Image
out of a Directory with Images. If the Wiki is not available right

There is, this solution is tested with 2.5.12, I think it should work for you.

Replace this:

With something like this:

WindowId $0 Piperead "echo WindowId root WarpToWindow $(($[w.x]+($[w.width]/2)))p $(($[w.y]+($[w.height]/2)))p"

I thought FVWM is just a very configurable WM, so it does not to have 
live on the majority but "could" work for everyone, who is willing to 
configure. So, some new features would be nice.
Like a better implementation for transparence in colorsets since xorg 
gives us a "native" way.

But nevertheless FVWM lives from sample configs, because the 
documentation maybe complete, but it is neither ordered from a user 
perspective nor easy understandable.

I do not know, but 3D desktops is like some pages/dekstops but you can 
see some hint on the content. It is not this big improvement but it is 
more easily to understand, cause 3D is your normal life, so you know, 
that there are things behind/right/left of other things, which you can 
see if you change your view (this is like changing the viewport, but 
htis is some more abstraction, which makes it less understandable).

ACK. That it is what it makes hard vor new users. Deploy some new 
default configs. There are enough of them in the net.

I know know it is too late but:

Key Tab     A       M      WindowList CurrentAtEnd

solves this double Tab...
And it works just great. Only Openoffice sucks with navigator and style 
window.

I use this snippet of code which uses python :

It could be due to these fonts I'm using:

SetEnv      ALxftFont1  "xft:Verdana:antialias=True:pixelsize=10"
SetEnv      ALxftFont2  "xft:Tahoma:antialias=True:pixelsize=12"

The fonts are being used in Titlebar & menus. They are being displayed
properly. If it is displaying them properly, then why this error is
coming up?

Thanks for your response,

Without seeing where you really are using those fonts, it's hard to
tell.  One way I was able to generate that message is by doing this:

AddToDecor DecorBase AddButtonStyle 2 Font \
 "xft:Verdana:bold:antialias=True:pixelsize=14"

The error indicates that the word "Font" is invalid in a AddButtonStyle
command.

You can paste each of these into FvwmConsole,
any errors will display in the console.

TitleStyle Font xxx will cause the message.

Hi,

unfortunately the FFII and related organizations have been forced into
some last minute actions to prevent the council from "silently" passing
the EU Software Patent directive in the Agriculture and Fisheries
Council on Tuesday next week.  That would be one major step towards the
legalization of Software Patents in Europe.  Read more about it on the
corresponding protest page:

http://demo.ffii.org

In spite of the last minute call for protest, quite a large number of
corporations, organizations, and individuals have decided to participate
in a Web-Demo which may prove to be an important channel to make the
press aware of the topic.

It would be great if FVWM, an large and well known Free Software
project, could participate in the demo, either by substituting the home
page, or by putting a banner on web page(s).  Links to banners can be
found on the demo page mentioned above.

Please also help spreading the word quickly, by contacting Free Software
projects and other players in the software business.  I need to get some
sleep now. %-)

Felix

PS: I still have some more FVWM logo images lying on my hard disk that I
haven't gotten around to finish up.  If you want to include a banner or
some such thing into FVWM 2.5, let me know, and I'll hurry up.

Hi,

Felt like sharing this. This was what I did.

#!/bin/perl
use Mail::IMAPClient;
$host = "my-mail-server";
$id = "uday";
$pass=xxxxxxxx;
$folder = "INBOX";
$imap = Mail::IMAPClient->new(
Server => $host,
User => $id,
Password=> $pass,
Fast_io=>1,
) or die "Cannot connect to $host as $id: $@";
while (1) {
	$imap->connect;
	$count = 0;
	defined($count = $imap->recent_count($folder))
	or die "Could not recent_count: $@\\n";
	print STDERR "the count is ", $count, " new
messages\n";


	if ($count){
		open MAILFILE, ">mail" or die "unable to open mail
file\n";
		print MAILFILE "new mail";

	}
	$imap->logout;
	close MAILFILE;
	sleep 300;
};

and set fvwmtaskbar to watch on mail file.

Thanks
Uday

FvwmTaskBar just watches a file for new mails.  You
could use some other program such as fetchmail to
download the mails to a local file.  If this is
inacceptable, you can make some external script that
checks for new mail and writes something to a fake
mailbox,
e.g.:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo > /tmp/have_new_mail
  while true; do
    if new_mail_in_imap_box; then
      echo "new mail" >> /tmp/have_new_mail
    fi
    sleep 300
  done

And tell FvwmTaskBar to watch the /tmp/have_new_mail
file instead of a real mailbox:

  *FvwmTaskBar: MailBox /tmp/have_new_mail

The difficult part is to write the
"new_mail_in_imap_box" command or function.  Since I
never used IMAP, I don't know what tools there are to
do it.

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Unfortunately, things seem to have changed in a bad way:

http://kwiki.ffii.org/Kuenast041221De

There's a little hope, though, that some states may object adopting the
item, at least on legal grounds: Having the SWPat directive as an
"A"-item on the agenda by tomorrow violates the Council's rules of
procedure.

This is a shot in the dark - has anyone encountered the GotoPAge 
function(s) not working in XDirectFB?

My config is Gentoo, directfb-0.9.20-r1, xdirectfb-1.0_rc5-r1.

The config works fine in "normal" X, just not under xdirectfb.

My syntax is pretty simplistic:

*NavButtons: (Title NAV, Action 'GotoPage +0 +0')

NavButtons is an instance of FvwmButtons of course - using FvwmButtons to 
make a "pager" of sorts. Button clicks switch screens/apps.

Ideas?

Hi,

  I am running Cygwin/X in rootless mode and started
  fvwm2.  In the rootless mode, how do I get control of
  the mouse buttons (mapped to menus in fvwm2rc in the root window context).  
  I tried mapping other keys (like F1, F2 etc.) to the Menus, but
  it does not seem to work.  Is this possible at all?  to trap peripheral input
  in a rootless mode.

  Thanks much.
  Best Regards,
  -senthil

Hi everyone,
I have a question about keybindings, and wether it is
possible to dynamically assign keybindings depending on the
application being used.
I'd like to disable/re-map some keybindings to other keys so
that the current maps dont interfere with the application in
use, this could be some 3D application which makes intensive uses of
the Meta+mouse buttons.

So the idea would be like, specifying all the keybindings
for all situations, and then, depending if the window class
	would match, a set of keybindings would become active
	overrulling the set already mapped.
	When the application exits, the keybindings revert to
	their "original" state.

	Anyone have some pratical way of accomplish this?
	Thanks.

Regards,

I am setting up an old laptop computer with FVWM for my mother and it
works great. In the current unstable there is a ClockFormat option.

*FvwmTaskBar: ClockFormat <strftime format>

I am not sure if FVWM functions can return values, but I think it
would be great to allow something like this:

*FvwmTaskBar: ExtendedClockText <some function that gets called at
each UpdateInterval>

This way I could get my battery level percentage down there by the
clock. I'm sure others could find more creative uses for this. I tried
to hack this in myself but I don't really understand C and I honestly
couldn't see how the current system works. (Goodies.c?)

A better idea would be to make FvwmTaskBar able to swallow arbitrary windows
like FvwmButtons does. Writing a string into clock looks too "ad hoc" to me.

I'm just using FvwmButtons and FvwmScript to display my battery
level. Not really what your asking, but here is the code what I'm
using if you need it.
( the output is something like 'AC 99% 43.0=B0')

This is a ruby script to get the battery level and the degrees:
------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
online =3D false
degree =3D '??'
procent =3D '??'
status =3D `acpi -atc`
status.each_line do |line|
    line.chomp!
    online =3D (line =3D~ /.*on-line.*/) if line =3D~ /.*AC Adapter.*/
    if line =3D~ /.*Thermal.*/
        degree =3D line.gsub!(/.*,/, '')
        degree.gsub!(/degrees.*/, '')
        degree.strip!
    end
    if line =3D~ /.*Battery.*/
        procent =3D line.gsub(/.*ing,/, '')
        procent.gsub!(/, .*/, '')
        procent.strip!
    end
end

if online; print 'AC' else print 'DC' end
print " #{procent}"=20
puts " #{degree}=B0"
------------------------------------------------------------------
And here is the FvwmAcpi script:

Since nobody answered, I doubt that doing _exactly_ what you describe
is possible at the moment.  But you might want to try what I do (which
I consider to be a better solution).  I have set up Scroll_Lock as a
modifier in my ~/.Xmodmap and use it to "toggle" fvwm keybindings
totally off or on.  You have to make sure that all of your "A" (Any)
modifier fvwm keybindings are changed to "N" (None) (unless of course
you do not want to toggle that particular keybinding), and that you do
not list Scroll_Lock in your fvwm "IgnoreModifiers" command.

To add Scroll_Lock as you mod5 modifier (if it is not that already),
add the following to the end of your ~/.Xmodmap

clear mod5
add mod5 = Scroll_Lock

So far I have only run into one and only one application which even
noticed that Scroll_Lock was on: Turbo Pascal 4.0 running inside
xdosemu, and the fvwm keybinding toggle effect still worked for it.

This solution has the added advantage of turning the Scroll Lock light
on and off to remind you that the fvwm keybindings are disabled.

Hope this helps.

You could define a set of functions that setup all keybindings that
change when you switch applications and call them using FvwmEvent.

DestroyFunc Keybinds_A
DestroyFunc Keybinds_B

AddToFunc Keybinds_A I Key Key1 A A ThisFunc
AddToFunc Keybinds_B I Key Key1 A A ThatFunc

AddToFunc Keybinds_A I Key Key2 A A ThisFunc2
AddToFunc Keybinds_B I Key Key2 A A ThatFunc2

DestroyFunc Change_KB
AddToFunc Change_KB
+ I ThisWindow (MyApp) Keybinds_A
+ I ThisWindow (!MyApp) Keybinds_b

*FvwmEvent-Keybinds: focus_change Change_KB
Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Keybinds

Hello,
I am using fvwm 2.5.8 and notice the following problem
with several applications/toolkits (at least: all Tcl/Tk
apps using Tk standard dialogs, gucharmap, xmms):
I start the app on desk, say, X (I use 4 desks), do
something which opens a dialog box, close the
dialog box; then I move the main window to desk Y, do
the same op which opens the very same dialog box as before: 
said dialog still appears on desk X, i.e., on the desk where it
appeared the first time, instead of desk Y, where the app
is now. (notice that fvwm switches desk appropriately to show
me the now focused dialog).

Since I program in Tcl/Tk, I can tell that the problem
happens with dialog windows which are "withdrawn" when done
and on the second request are mapped again.
If the dialog is destroyed, instead of withdrawn, and 
later re-created then there is no problem.
I don't know anything about gtk.

Normally I use a very complex .fvwm2rc, but to pinpoint the
source of problem I reduced it to the following three lines:

  Style FvwmPager Sticky
  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmPager 0 3


Help is appreciated, even if just to tell me that the
problem lies with a misuse of the window states on the part
of the various toolkits (gtk, tcl/tk,..?)

Thanks,
  Roberto Ugoccioni

Starting with 2.5.11, you may specify a window name in Key and Mouse
commands, see examples in the man page:

I've been having trouble with the Layer and StaysOn* styles.  With an  
empty setup file, I startup fvwm and start an FvwmConsole and a few  
windows to play with.  I type into the console:

	Pick WindowStyle Layer 6
	Pick WindowStyle StaysOnTop
	UpdateStyles
	Pick FvwmIdent

and select a window.  FvwmIdent says the layer is still 4, and it behaves  
as if the layer is still 4.  'Pick Layer 0 6' works fine.  Am I missing  
something or is this a bug?

Yes, you should use Layer command after the window is mapped. Even
Recapture does not reset the style layer in 2.5.x. This is intended.
BTW, UpdateStyles is only useful in the middle of some function.

> Am I missing something or is this a bug?

You are not the first "missing" it. What is actually important for us is
that Dominik does not think it is a bug. If you really want, some well
constructed Google query may bring previous discussions on the topic.

Is this done anywhere yet?

There are a few occasions where I would wish to save then restore
stacking order (i.e. which window is in front of which Window).
Further, most of the time, when I switch focus I'd like it to switch to
the window that's next highest in the order.  Keep in mind that I'm not
talking about making use of layers here.

Hi,

I want to use FvwmButtons similar to FvwmTaskBar. I also want my
"taskbar" to automatically disappear if it is not needed. This is also 
possible with FvwmTaskBar, I know, but FvwmTaskBar automatically
covers the whole width of the page which I don't want. Now I have the 
command

EdgeCommand Bottom Module FvwmButtons -g +2-2 -transientpanel \
            FvwmButtons-Task

in my .fvwm2rc.
I discovered the problem that when I hit the edge two times the 
"taskbar" won't disappear any more. Why? What to do?
 
Regards Marc

Hello,

Ok, there are two things I want to try to get in my Fvwm configuration, but I'm 
not sure if they're possible or not.

First window snapping. Yes, I have it working already, what I want to do is more 
complex. In a default Gnome configuration the moving and resizing of windows is 
free with no snapping. But if you hold down a button, I think shift, while 
moving windows it forces it to snap to an edge no matter what.  What I would 
like is to configure Fvwm so that moving or resizing anything in Fvwm forces 
snapping. However, holding down a key, maybe the window key (SUPER_L) allows 
free movement and resizing.

The second thing I want to do may be more difficult. I was watching someone use 
a powerbook and it has this really neat feature. Basically they push some key 
combination and the screen zooms way way out. Every open window is displayed 
with no overlapping. All the windows turn into seperate thumbnails and they all 
fit nicely in the screen. Then whichever thumbnail gets clicked becomes the top 
focused window. Is there a way to do this with Fvwm or even X11?  It's really 
cool.

-Scott

This is called   Expos=E9. There are some   attempts to mimic this  with
X11. The best one is Skippy :
    <URL:http://thegraveyard.org/skippy.php>

Skippy-XD, the version for X.org, is able to do  the same as Expos=E9 in
Mac OS  X.  The  non X.org version    is unable, with  fvwm,  to paint
correctly windows outside  the current  screen  and is  pretty slow to
take snapshots.

In the 4th edition Linux In A Nutshell from O'Reilly, there is a
section on fvwm2 which includes the following sample configuration:

    *FvwmWinListAction Clock3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent

which does not work.  The manpage says this should do the trick:

    *FvwmWinList: Action Click3 Module FvwmIdent

which seems to not work either.  No error message from either attempt,
and I tried several variations.

I am running gentoo with fvwm version 2.5.10-r3 on an opteron system.

That line is from the file:

modules/FvwmWinList/config.sample

Except it should say "Click3", not "Clock3".

I just read in that file and tried it.  It worked for me.

Both commands do the same thing.  The second syntax is preferred.

I think this is possible with the new composite extension from
x.org, but I don't think fvwm supports it yet.

Hi all,

I'm running fvwm-2.5.12-4; the problem is that sometimes (I couldn't find when
exactly) the key-bindings stop working, and I can't use them even restarting
fvwm. After that i can use the mouse to access menus, windowlist, etc, but not
using keys.

I'm thinking on mozilla-firefox block pop-up feature; when this problem
happens, allways is mozilla-firefox running, but I'm not sure because I can't
trace the error.

Which could be the problem? How can I fix it? Any help would be appreciated.

TIA, and sorry for my english

Hi all,

Im using FVWM 3 days ago and its a really powerfull and flexible WM ,
probably the most ;)

But im having 2 troubles , first with PYPANEL , it doesent stays at the bottom

I use this line on PYPANEL config

P_LOCATION      = 1             # Top/Bottom placement (0 top / 1 bottom)

And this other one on FVWM config

Style "pypanel" NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, StaysOnBottom, Sticky

And PYPANEL always stays at the top or middle for the screen :(

The other trouble is with FVWMButtons, I cant see them correctly...

There is the config

There is the config

Thanks for all,
cocozz

This sounds like a FAQ 0.1 problem... ^_^
Make sure this doesn't have to do with CapsLock/NumLock/ScrollLock modifer.
If it does, then you can add

IgnoreModifiers L25

in your config file.

Happy new year! ^_^

Read the FVWM FAQ, question 0.1.

The problem is your numlock key.

Whoops on the typo, that is my fault, not O'Reilly's.  I found my
problem, too ... I was still using the old WindowList, not
FvwmWinList.  Now it works :-)

The Fvwm StaysOnBottom style controls the top to bottom order
of windows, not the position of the window on the screen.

I think what you are concerned with the the window positioning.
Look at UsePPosition and related options in the man page.

Now that I have discovered FvwmWinList instead of Windowlist, I have
been customizing it.  I have one hotkey to pop it up, another to make
it go away.  One thing I would like is to have it pop up near the
mouse, not any fixed location.  This would be similar to the xmessage
option -nearmouse.  Is this possible?  I'd like this for FvwmPager
too, and probably others later.

Is there a way to specify the location of the geometry window that
appears when moving or resizing windows?

Thanks

Hi,
I have a problem with an idea to use a program multiple times in
FvwmButtons for different mailboxes (wmymail). The problem is that the
wmymail doesn't allow to give another name for the executed instance
from commandline, thus, I end up having multiple *FvwmButtons Swallow
"Untitled" blahblah in the fvwmconfig. Ok, I remember reading about this
issue from somewhere, but the info gets lots everytime one needs it, and
such is the case for me.
I would need FvwmButtons to wait for the invocation of the program, as
in, launch one instance at a time, so that 1st invocation would end up
being the first in the box, etc. It seems like fbuttons is launching all
the programs at once, thus resulting in a scenario where I have Title
inbox, and wmybox pointing to somewhere else (to clarify, here is a pic:
http://whitecortex.net/~mikko/screenshot.png).
I tried to use sleep 1 with the command execution, but the results
remain same. I would greatly appreciate any help as the wmymail program
is something I really would like using in this setup.

(ps. I've not subscribed at the moment)

Mikko

You would bind your magic key function (eg Alt-Mouse-1) to a function that
turns off snapping, invokes resize or move, then turns it on again.

Resizing of a window is always free in fvwm, with no snapping.

As for moving a window, Once you setup snapping, you already have a way
to disable it by pressing/releasing Alt modifier while you move a window.

Real zooming of windows can't be easily implemented without support in X.

If you just want to conveniently see the list of all windows on the
current page, then try the module currently named FvwmProxy in 2.5.

Traditional methods may work too, WindowList, transient FvwmWinList or
FvwmIconMan, FvwmWindowMenu.

Mikhael.

This does what you want:

  FvwmWinList -transient
  FvwmIconMan -transient
  FvwmPager -transient 0 3

This window is in the screen center with "Emulate mwm", and is in
top-left corner with "Emulate fvwm".

Transient does more than I want :-( With the FvwmWinList, it also no
longer tracks the mouse as it moves over different windows.  Instead,
it shows which window had focus when it popped up, and since it popped
up under the mouse, it always shows itself, rather than where the
mouse was before it popped up.

With FvwmPager, as soon as I press any other key, it goes away.

Transient seems to have different effects for different modules.  All
I want is to change the popup location, nothing else.
