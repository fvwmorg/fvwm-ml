I compiled up Fvwm2pl42 (and fixed the makefile for FvwmConfig) but I can't
seem to make FvwmConfig do anything.  I would expect to see a pop-up 
window or something, but I don't even see any error output. 

Is there anything obvious that I missing here??

I think the attached is what you are asking for.  Note that with emacs
19.30 I had to do

(add-hook 'winmgr-mode-hook
	  '(lambda ()
	     (setq font-lock-defaults
		   '(winmgr-font-lock-keywords nil nil nil nil))
	     (turn-on-font-lock)))

instead of the hook mentioned in the source file.

;;; winmgr-mode.el -- window manager mode and the font lock configurations

;; Maintainer: David Konerding (rafael@cse.ucsc.edu)
;; Modifications by: Stefan Strobel <strobel@lia.univ-savoie.fr>

;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a major mode for editing window configuration files and
;; also defines font-lock keywords for such files.

;; winmgr-mode mode will automatically get turned on if you visit a
;; a file whose name looks like that of a configuration file
;; (IE, .fvwmrc, .mwmrc, .tvtwmrc, etc)

;; The current font-lock keywords are:

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by whitespace gets colored using
;; font-lock-function-name-face.

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by a "(" (IE, an m4 macro) gets colored using
;; font-lock-comment-face

;; Put this in your .emacs :
;;
;;(setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)
;;              ("\\.[A-Za-z]*wmrc" . winmgr-mode) 
;;	      auto-mode-alist))
;;
;;(autoload 'winmgr-mode "winmgr-mode"
;;  "Mode for editing window manager config files")
;;
;;(add-hook 'winmgr-mode-hook
;;	  '(lambda ()
;;	     (font-lock-mode t)
;;	     (setq font-lock-keywords winmgr-font-lock-keywords)
;;           (font-lock-fontify-buffer)))
;;


;;; Code:


(defvar winmgr-mode-hook nil
  "Hook to be run when mode is entered")


(defvar font-lock-m4-face 'default

speaking of fvwm on solaris, has anyone gotten 2.0.42 to work properly with 
sun's X server? we've got a box here with solaris 2.5, CDE, and i built 2.0.42 
for it/no errors with sparc compiler 4.0.  i put it in no-window-manager mode 
(this is a CDE thing), and run fvwm2 and it hangs -- mouse still works but i 
can't type a thing and no window manager starts.  i have to telnet in and kill 
fvwm to do anything again.  fvwm 1.24 i also compiled but it runs no problem.  
also, if i run fvwm2 from my linux box i'm set (nfs mount so definitely same 
config file...) -- any ideas?

Look for mogrify as well, it's part of ImageMagick:

mogrify(1)               USER COMMANDS                 mogrify(1)

NAME
     mogrify - transform an image or sequence of images

SYNOPSIS
     mogrify [ options ...] file [ [ options ...] file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images.  These
     transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color
     reduction, and others.  The transmogrified image overwrites
     the original image.

EXAMPLES
[..] To create a single colormap for a sequence of bird images,
     use:

	 mogrify -colors 256 scenes/birds.*

OPTIONS
[..] -colors value
	  preferred number of colors in the image.

	  The actual number of colors in the image may be less
	  than your request, but never more.  Note, this is a
	  color reduction option.  Images with less unique colors
	  than specified with this option will remain unchanged.
	  Refer to quantize(9) for more details.

	  If more than one image is specified on the command
	  line, a single colormap is created and saved with each
	  image.

	  Note, options -colormap, -dither, -colorspace, and
	  -treedepth affect the color reduction algorithm.

     -colorspace value
	  the type of colorspace: GRAY, OHTA, RGB, Transparent,
	  XYZ, YCbCr, YIQ, YPbPr, or YUV.

	  Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB
	  color space.  Empirical evidence suggests that
	  distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond
	  to perceptual color differences more closely than do
	  distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give
	  better results when color reducing an image.  Refer to
	  quantize(9) for more details.

	  The Transparent color space behaves uniquely in that it
	  perserves the matte channel of the image if it exists.

	  The -colors or -monochrome option is required for this
	  option to take effect.

ImageMagick          Last change: 1 May 1994                   15


Only found this after we finished pixy, and I didn't test it against
pixy. But I thought it was worth mentioning.

I had the same problem, way back with 1.2x on AIX. I fixed it by hacking
the source to put in the complete domain name using gethostbyname().

Note that setting and exporting HOSTDISPLAY in .xsession before launching
fvwm should work too, but it's not nearly as elegant and requires some
ugly code in .xsession to be general.

What are the chances of getting the official fvwm source to always use the
fully qualified hostname when setting HOSTDISPLAY? It should never hurt
anybody and will help those whose systems' hostname command returns the
short name instead of the fully qualified name.

well, not that bad:
I have a script that does these sort of things: (getting some info from 
the 'who' output and then guessing the domain from the hostname.
I use this to set the DISPLAY in my .cshrc, so the DISPLAY is up-to-date 
on any rsh login.
Now I just set HOSTDISPLAY to be DISPLAY in my .xsession

works fine.

useful would be a function, that'd output the "relative DISPLAY path",
given the client address (the server is as in HOSTDISPLAY - including
domain)

can someone come up with a load-time evaluated macro for this?

I couldn't get myself to use a perlscript, which is called from M4 to set a
variable, which is then used. -- too ugly.

OK, now we have BLT drag&drop, tkSteal for swallowing your favorite X
utilities, and, hold onto your seats, BALLOON HELP!

Almost certainly the new conglomeration of C stuff in libtkg will mean
portability problems.  Please let me know what troubles you find.
Also, the swallowing function right now can take a good bit of
fiddling with to get what you want (because you often have to specify
the geometry twice: once for the application, and again for the
tkgoodstuff window).

Cheers,
Mark

I'm using 2.0.41 with ClickToFocus set.  I have a problem when using
applications like netscape where windows pop up and then disappear
(say for searching).  The problem is that when a window dies, the
focus does not necessarily go back to the parent window (which had
the focus beforehand).  For example, I am using netscape and select a
postscript file, which pops a window for browsing postscript.  When I
g).  The problem is that when a window dies, the
focus does not necessarily go back to the parent window (which had
the focus beforehand).  For example, I am using netscape and select a
postscript file, which pops a window for browsing postscript.  When
I'm finished, I kill the postscript viewer, expecting the focus to
revert to netscape---but NO, the focus goes off to an icon, or to
FvwmButtons, or something like that.  Is there any way to get the
focus to return to the place whence it came??

Thanks,
James.

Known bug that I've been meaning to look into since I hit this
periodically myself, although I don't think I put that in the TO-DO or
the BUGS files.

I have seen this with many applications, including Tk-based apps,
XEmacs 19.13, and Netscape.  I have seen this problem exhibited on
most (all?) twm derived window managers, including ctwm, tvtwm, and
fvwm.  I've seen it on olwm and dtwm too which I don't *think* are twm
derivatives.  The only wm I haven't seen it on is my colleague's SGI
box.  I don't know what the standard IRIX wm is called, but that one
handled these focus problems okay.

This is the most annoying buglet about fvwm.  I'd love it if fvwm was
fixed!

I have not been able to run Xpaint 2.2 under fvwm beta 2.xxx.

It gives the following error message:
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  14 (X_GetGeometry)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  670
  Current serial number in output stream:  670

It seems it can't handle the geometry of the virtual windows.
I tried running xpaint in the root window with no luck either.

Anyone have problems with this?

Thanks.

Hello, I am running solaris 2.4 & fvwm2.0.42.  I just got proctool to
use and I get the following X error:

vlad: proctool
ProCtool, reading init file "/home/bpm/.proc.init" ...

  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
  Serial number of failed request:  1594

Any ideas?  Is this conflicting with FvwmButtons?

Thanks

Thanks!  That was it.  The problem was:

# Button 3 in the window, with the Modifier-1 key (usually alt or diamond)
# gives Raise-Lower. Used to use control here, but that interferes with xterm
Mouse 3         W       M       RaiseLower

But I in trying to determine the problem, I think I have found a bug!

Scenario:
 I am using a DeskTopSize 2x1.
 Take a normal window (xterm 80x24) and place it about 5 or less
pixels from the left edge.  Select the left edge of the window and try
to drag the left edge even further/closer to the desktop edge.
Release and whamo!  The window is now 224x24 in size!  Kind of cool.

Thanks

Known problem introduced in 2.0.42, already fixed for the next beta
(2.0.43).  Just avoid resizing and touching the absolute edges of the
virtual desktop until then... :)

Hi all,

I am using version 1.24 with my icon box set up along the left edge of the
screen.  When the icon is sitting there in an unselected state, the icon text
is left aligned, and I can only see the first 10-12 chars of the icon title.

When the icon becomes the active window (while still iconified), it shows its
full icon text centre aligned, causing the left part of the text to disappear
off the left side of the screen.

Q: Is there any way to configure fvwm to _always_ left align icon text?

Cheers,

Ron

Hi again...,


Is there a way in release 1.24 to get fvwm to logically swap the left & right
mouse buttons without having to reconfigure all the Mouse bindings in .fvwmrc?

Has this feature been added to 2.0.xx?

I can do it under HP-Vue, but for obvious reasons don't wish to fall back to
Vue just so I can use the mouse left handed...

Cheers,

Ron.

hi, all

i've run into a problem which must be fvwm related.  occasionally, after
running for a while ( > 2hours or so), fvwm loses all my key bindings
somehow. any keystroke is no longer captured for use, such as to change
screens, etc.  doing a Restart and/or an explicit Read of the config file
doesn't fix the problem either.  mouse bindings are kept, though.  i
couldn't find anything in the BUGS list on this, nor in the man pages.

this is with fvwm v2pl42, under linux (v1.3.100, elf) and XFree 3.1.2E

thanks in advance, greg

This is not a function of the window manager.  Instead, use the xmodmap
command.  You could add a menu item to exec the xmodmap command if you
wanted.

Is your NumLock turned on by any chance?

I was without a mouse for a bit yesterday, and I noticed this as well.  The
solution for me at lest was to start an rxvt from the command line and then
hope it would fall under the pointer, which would then restore the
'keybindings' to the mouse.

I have been trying out a new mail program, 'ml', and it seems that this
happens quite frequently when I have my disks thrashing, and an drop-down
dialog box tries to grab the cursor while at the same time I'm moving the
cursor out of the window.   'ml' gives an error message  about being unable
to capture the cursor or something.

More pieces to a puzzle.  This help anyone?

I get that as well under Solaris, usually moving into an xterm or an icon and back
out restores the bindings though. Usually happens with xlock.

I surfed the net and came upon FVWM and it looks like it is worth a try.

The problem I had during compilation is the lack of X11/xpm.h include file.

Has anyone else encountered the same problem and is there a work around.

I like Motif but FVWM adds that extra touch I suspect.

Thanks in advance.

It's not a problem. You must have the XPM library if you want XPM
support. 

All that is (very well) explained in the README/INSTALL etc. It's good
practice, and also polite, to read the manuals (AT LEAST THE READMEs)
before putting something to a larger audience.

Kind regards, Emilio.

hmmmmm,  well, turning it on produces the same behavior.  i've never seen
all the function and arrow keys react to the state of the NumLock key,
though.  interesting....

i'll let you know if it happens randomly again.  but if that was the fix,

Hi all,

sorry if this is a known and simple problem, but I couldn't solve it
after reading man, faq, etc.

The problem is that my pager always have the same geometry no matter
how many desktops I have. I have to mention that I have not specified
a fixed geometry for it :-). (Hold on! The relevant settings are
included at the end of this message.)

What I expect is that a pager with 3x2 desktops is 50% wider than a
pager with 2x2 desktops. Seems that FvwmPagerDeskTopScale is not
respected.

Here go the relevant parts of my "~/.fvwm2rc":

######################################################################
### The virtual desktop
## DeskTopSize 2x2
DeskTopSize 3x2
EdgeResistance 750 50
EdgeScroll 100 100
######################################################################

######################################################################
### The pager
*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmPagerGeometry +0-0
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Fvwm
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 50

Thanks for your help.

Kind regards, Emilio.

  This has been like this since 2.x, and yet to be resolved. Chuck at one
  point claimed he was going to take a look at it, probably on a private
  e-mail. You'll have to full around with the geometry settings until you
  get it "right."

  I've started to fix this several times, but never finished it. The way it
  works is that the pager is initialized for a 3x3 desktop (hardcoded), and
  at that time the scale, if no dimension were given in the geometry
  string, takes effect. Only after this are the real dimensions of the
  desktop gotten from fvwm and the pager redrawn, but within the current
  geometry of the pager, i.e. no attention is given to scale at that point.

  (This was typed without going back and look at the code, but I think it
  is correct.)

Well, I figured out some of my icon problems from a few days ago and
now I am able to attach the nice GNU icon to my EMACS session. Now I
am trying to work out how to make the nasty text labels go away.

Specifically, I have the following attributes in my .fvwm2rc

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "emacs" Icon gnu.xpm

This gives me the gnu where I expect it. The problem comes when I fire
up xterms. I would like to have no iconified form on the screen. That
way, I could have those xterms which are uniconified visible and those
which are iconified would appear only in the winList. What I get is
an icon with  no picture but with a title bar. Can I make this go
away?

You may want to make sure that after the "Style "*" NoIcon", there is not a 
Style "xterm" or anothter "Style "*" that overides it.

Perhaps define an iconbox outside of your viewable windowspace.

Like perhaps

Style "*" NoIcon, IconBox +5000+5000+4000+4000

or something like that...:-)

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7

Hi all,

I'm using a Sparcstation 2 with Solaris 2.5 and OpenWindows 3.5 installed.
Recently, I compiled fvwm-2.0.42 and installed it (I used gcc 2.7.2).
The compilation and installation went smoothly enough, including such
niceties as rplay support, etc.  However, when I ran it (from my .xinitrc
file), it started acting strangely.  Before I describe what's wrong,
let me just say that I'm using the sample fvwmrc file supplied with
the package, twiddled somewhat for my site (the module, pixmap and bitmap
paths are different).

The problem is that, with the exception of surrounding borders and the
title bar, no other decorations are being put on any windows.  What's
more, the mouse doesn't have any effect on the windows.  Actually, this
is slightly misleading - I can use any mouse support that the application
has (such as cutting and pasting or xterm menus), but cannot use it
to access any fvwm features such as window dragging and resizing or
drop-down menus.

The first time I started fvwm2, I couldn't even exit X (I had no xterm up
and no way to get one either) so I had to reboot...  Occassionally, when
I started fvwm2, I couldn't actually type into the xterm that came up -
however, I could still cut-and-paste to and from it, so I had to
cut-and-paste garbage from my bash$ prompt so that bash gave me an error.
This gave me more letters that I could 'type' with, and eventually I
was able to do a 'ps' and a 'kill' on my fvwm process.  It was better
than rebooting, I suppose... :-)

It seems to me that no functions are being executed (the InitFunction
doesn't start either).

Has anyone else happened across this problem?  Anyone got a solution?

Regards,
 Robert.

You are definately not getting the rc file read at all.  If you compiled a
binary called fvwwm2, chances are it wants to find a config file ~/.fvwm2rc
not .fvwmrc...  It is a compile time thing setup in Fvwm.tmpl...

And where did you put it? <grin>

If you are truly using fvwm2.0.42, there will be an exit menu bound to one
of the buttons when you click on the background defined by default.  You
could have avoided this.  (Now I tell you, right? :-)

Yes, many a time, when I was compiling it for my other various accounts and
I forgot to put the rc file where it expects it to go...

Hello all,

I fail to configure the CDE start screen (login screen) from which 
you can select the window manager you want to use (dtwm or olwm as
default with the system installation) to start fvwm.

I have copied the right files from /usr/dt/config to /etc/dt/config
but it seems that it doen't read what's in this directory.

I only have succeeded in adding a new choice in the CDE start screen
for fvwm.

If anyone has perform such configuration, his help will be welcome.

(I have a SUN SparcStation 4 with solaris 2.5)

Thank's

	Hi!  According the the docs, this is the place where
I am supposed to mail bug reports/patches.  Anyhow, fvwm2.0.42 (the
latest I could locate) does not compile under SunOS, which does not
have strerror in its libc.  I used an implementation of strerror
that I wrote for this patch.
	In unrelated matters, could you please upload fvwm2 to
ftp.x.org and also announce new versions on comp.os.linux.announce?
It is anything but obvious where to find fvwm2.  It took me several
months before I finally stumbled into the new site.  Thanks!

Well, fvwm2 hasn't been released from beta yet, so it's pretty much
pointless to announce development versions to the world.  We have the
fvwm-announce list for that kind of thing.  Rest assured that when 2.1
comes out it will be announced far and wide.

Well, we announced the move to the linux groups and of course we kept the
mailing list running with the same subscribers.  The old sites and
addresses kept pointers for a good while, but I'm sure they've expired
after all this time.  I can't see what else was to be done; I've maintained
the list and ftp site and Chuck has maintained the code for nearly a year
now (well, ten months).

	If the code is reasonably stable, then the extra visibility
from comp.os.linux.announce and ftp.x.org would probably be helpful.

	It would be nice if spcot.sanders.com had a README pointing to
the new site.  And it woul be good if CERT knew about the new site (it
has a mention of fvwm in /pub/latest_sw_versions).  I see now that
sunsite did have a copy, but I usually check ftp.x.org; linux sites
have a lot of bastardized versions of software, so I prefer reference
sites for a program.

I don't know if this is a bug or something that was intentionally done,
but I noticed a difference in behavior between the WindowList in FVWM-1
and in FVWM-2.  Basically, in FVWM-1, the windows in the windowlist
would be sequenced in the order in which they were last accessed.  This
was very convenient because I had bound some keys to bring up the
WindowList and then I could use keystrokes (j or k) to easily go up or
down to switch between menus.  So, if I was working between two windows
and wanted to toggle between them, all I had to do is bring up the
WindowList (i.e. Alt+F1), and then press j-j to switch to the previous
window, then enter to select it.

This "convenient" reordering of the windows in the WindowList is not
present in FVWM-2, and maybe that was by design.  I just think that it
would be more convenient for the windows to reorder in the order in
which they were last accessed, especially when there are many windows
open.

Thanks

Good point; I didn't realize that site was still up.  Robert, (if you're
reading) do you recall who ran that site?  Otherwise it's mail off to root.

CERT?  Hmmm.  That's kind of surprising.  You never know who keeps lists.
I think they'll all find out soon enough, though.

You can get this sort of behaviour using Fvwm2's Next and Prev commands.
Bind these to, say Alt+Tab (for the windows users out there).

Key Tab         A       M       Prev Focus

Right, but that sort of defeats the original purpose of using WindowList
in the first place: I like to be able to see which window I am
selecting, especially in the case that the window I am selecting is not
the previously selected one.  This helps when a large number of windows
are open.

Yeah, I guess someone's going to have to write another module for
Fvwm. The Win95 mechanism is pretty good. You hit Alt+Tab, and a
window with all the icons in "most recently visited" order appears.
More presses of Tab (whilst holding down Alt) selects the icon.

Maybe if I have time....

Well, the funny thing I noticed is that when you actually click on the
windows, they get reordered in the WindowList, whereas if you just
select the window in the WindowList itself, they don't.  I myself am not
a programmer extraordinaire, but it seems as if this could be changed
relatively easily.  (That's why I posted this question in the first
place.)

It would be kewl to have a Win95-like mechanism though...

Thanks

I, for one (maybe the only one) would most appreciate a way to specify an
ordering in either the FvwmWinList module or in the internal WindowList. 
I use many windows in a typical session, spanning several pages, and it
would be very nice for me to be able to specify 

1) (*minimal wish*) alphabetic ordering, or 

2) a specified ordering, perhaps of the form found in the Style
directives, where the matches to the first window name would occor first,
then to the second name form, and so on, defaulting to alphabetic at the
end. 

This would be of great assistance to me, as I often have 20 windows open,
and reading down the list to find a name buried somewhere in there is
unnecessarily time-consuming (but !!!MUCH BETTER!!! than the HP-VUE
default of having to remember which page the window is on, and whether it
is iconized or buried under another window, or destroyed, or ....)

I imagine that simple modifications could be made to FvwmWinList to
give it a reordering option as well.

I just tried that, and observed that behavior as well.  It is a bug by
my way of thinking, although I'll have to look a little harder to
figure out what's really wrong.  It probably won't be fixed in the
next beta or the first offical release, but I'll see what I can do
(i.e. it'll make it to the TO-DO list as a bug).

I wouldn't agree - it's in beta state for a reason still, and beta
generally means that the whole world shouldn't know about it, just a
smaller portion, since trouble can be expected.  I do occasionally
mess things up so it doesn't compile or link on some platforms and
more than enough people access it already to swamp me and the list
with email about it not linking or compiling every time another beta
is released.

But I HAVE announced the new ftp and official web site several times
(and various other things about 2.xx) on comp.windows.x.apps and
comp.os.linux.announce, and answered many a question about fvwm on the
former as well where I reference the web site (always stressing that
it is still beta code).

The new ftp & web site info is also in the comp.windows.x.apps FAQ.

Yeah, way too long for it to still be in beta, which is why I really
want to have only one more beta and then the first official 2.xx
release (2.1.0).

Yup.

Have you tried the IconManager?

I use it all the time to manage a large number of
windows on several desktops; it's far better than using icons
or relying on the FvwmWinList.

You can have several window lists (xterm windows in one list,
emacs/vi windows in another list, etc.),
specify alphabetical ordering, iconify/deiconify/warp to windows
by using the mouse on the window lists, and more.

Check out the FvwmIconMan man page for details.

Try this:

	(1) Iconify an XEmacs frame
	(2) De-Iconify an XEmacs frame
	    => OK, FvwmPager tracks the iconic state
	(3) Iconify the XEmacs frame again
	(4) Move the icon
	(5) De-Iconify the XEmacs frame
	(6) Iconify the XEmacs frame again
	    => FvwmPager doesn't show the frame as being iconified.

I've only been able to reprduce this using XEmacs, and only when using
the frame-icon package:

;;; FRAME-ICON.EL - set up mode-specific icons for each frame in XEmacs
;;; Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995 Michael J Lamoureux

which appears to do a second iconification based upon the buffer's
mode name.

Maybe its too hard to fix.

I think I may have another possible bugger here.

Swallow FvwmPager into FvwmButtons and set the "Respawn" attribute.

i.e.

*FvwmButtons(1x1 Size 64 38 Swallow(Respawn) "xmailbox"   'Exec xmailbox')
*FvwmButtons(1x1	    Icon x.xbm	      Action 	  'Exec "" xgo')
*FvwmButtons(1x1	    Swallow(Respawn) "xdaliclock" 'Exec xdaliclock')
*FvwmButtons(1x2	    Swallow(Respawn) "xcmap"	  'Exec xcmap')
*FvwmButtons(1x1	    Swallow(Respawn) "xload"	  'Exec xload')
*FvwmButtons(1x4	    Swallow(Respawn) "FvwmPager"  'FvwmPager 0 3')

Now, drag a window on the pager around (you may have to take it to
another Desk, I'm not 100% sure right now.

Anyway. . . Buttons seems to kill (Pager dies?) and Swallow and then
Respawn a new Pager.

At least the system is usable but really annoying.  Can anyone duplicate
this or is my system peculiar?  Incidentally, the list above is the only
Buttons I have in my bar, nothing else.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7


	This also contains the SunOS patch since it is right
next to the Ultrix patch.  As patched, fvwm compiles under X11R6.1pl1
on:

	SunOS4.1.4, Solaris 2.4, OSF/1 2.1, HP-UX 9.05
	IRIX 5.3, Linux 1.2.13, Ultrix 4.4, AIX 3.2.5

For the compiler, I used cc for IRIX and gcc for the others.

	The fixed problems added to the patch include:

1) Fvwm.tmpl does not set up the link environment properly as is
   done for X11R6 and later.  This causes the binary to be linked
   incorrectly under Solaris using X11R6 or later.

2) Ultrix does not have strdup.

	One additional problem I noticed but did not patch was in
FvwmScroll.  Both .c files declare storage for the same variables.
The storage for a given variable should only be in one .c file and the
prototypes should go in the header file.  The problem is not critical
under C, but it would be good to fix before the general release.  It
would cause a problem under C++, however, which assumes static linkage
for variables not declared extern.

Hi:

I would like to know where I could get libXpm, XpmLibs and XpmIncs(source
file). It will be very appreciated if someone could give some ideas (I
was in ftp.x.org and I could not locate them).

Thnaks.

I just tried this.  I use SloppyFocus and clicking into the xterms
doesn't help.  Nor does typing something into them.  Refer to my
earlier mail (from a few minutes ago) to the list for the whole story.
This is just an addendum...

While we're at the subject of Next and Prev, I wonder.  I once thought
that these would select windows based on a last-visited basis.  So, I
made an experiment:

>From a menu, I called up three xterms which I will call A, B and C in
the following.  I position the mouse in A (which makes A have focus as
I use SloppyFocus).  I hit Alt-k (bound to Prev) which takes me to B.
Fine.  I move the mouse into C then back into A, taking care that the
mouse doesn't touch B on the way.  I hit Alt-k which takes me to C,
right?  Wrong, it takes me to B.

What's the story?  Is anybody else seeing this?

ObFvwmAdvocacy:

Hey, Rob and Chuck, thanks for the great work on Fvwm -- it lets me
work around a misfeature in Mosaic and Netscape (probably in other
motifish programs, too).  You would think that using a keyboard
shortcut to, say, pop up a file selector box is a way of avoiding
using the mouse, right?  Wrong.  If you use FocusFollowsMouse or
SloppyFocus, it isn't.  You have to grab the mouse then move the mouse
pointer into the file selector box to be able to type anything into it
:-(

Fvwm lets me choose ClickToFocus for selected windows, such as Mosaic
and Netscape, which avoids this problem :-)

It's in the /contrib/libraries directory.

Also have a look at:

You can get it there too.

I noticed that ftp.x.org has done something with its /contrib directory.  I 
think the mirror at ftp.cso.uiuc.edu:/pub/X11/contrib still exists, though.  
You should look for /pub/X11/contrib/libraries/libXpm...  or something 
similar.  
If anyone knows where ftp.x.org's /contrib directory went, I'd be interested 
to know.

Thanks,
Dan

That behaviour seems to be caused by the SetFocus() call with the 3rd 
parameter as zero in FocusOn(), builtins.c.

The SetFocus function moves the focused window to the top of the list only
if the 3rd parameter is set to True, apparently for click-to-focus
operations only (is not very clear to me why only in that case, do we
really need that 3rd parameter?). 

The following patch corrects the problem, for both the WindowList menu and 
SloppyFocus prev/next.

Hi Folks

This is something that's been bugging me for a long time, so I finally
lost my fvwm-hacking virginity and fixed it :-) 

On some applications I use the titlebar/icon name to convey useful
information: e.g. current working directory for xterms, buffer name for
emacs, etc. In the hope of being able to see this info even when iconised
I prefer not to use a pixmap for the icon, using:

Style "XTerm"       Icon none.xpm

My icon box runs across the top of the screen, so the icons take up little
(vertical) space and it actually looks quite smart (IMHO). 

When the app is first iconised the icon title bar is made just the right
width for the icon's title text (in CreateIconWindow()). However, if the
title changes and the window re-iconised its width doesn't change and it
is now either too wide or too narrow.

This patch to icons.c fixes this in every Iconify() without the overhead
of another call to CreateIconWindow().

Subject: FVWM: Swallow and Exec from one FvwmButton

X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7

Is it possible to have a button that does a swallow and have another
action tied to the button name?

The reason I ask is that I'm trying to set up a cluster monitor panel
which is basically nine xloads in a vertical button bar.  I have a label
for each button with the host name in it and would like to run a terminal
on that machine when the button is pressed.  I could do it with a button
for the xload with a button for the hostname underneath but the geometry
gets messy as I only want a small buttons for the names and the xloads
to take up the rest of the space.  With a combined swallow and label I
get this automatically.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

Hi, 

Several weeks ago, I asked about changing XPM icons with XEmacs on a
mode-dependent basis. I have since started using frame-icon.el, which
appears to do the trick. There are still some problems, though:

1) Whereas the Icons assigned using .fvwm2rc are fully "shaped", those
assigned using frame-icon are rectangular (i.e., within a white box with
a small border).

2) Other attributes--e.g. StickyIcon---are still based on the state of
the frame when it was created. It seems that it might be best to check
the state upon iconization.

3) Perhaps most important? Fvwm reports errors (into my
.xsession-errors) when XEmacs tries to change the icon. It looks like
pairs of lines like this:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 132, Error 4, EventType: 12

Sometimes, EventType is 0, 4, 12 or 28.

Any ideas?

Andrew

You might try the latest beta of tkgoodstuff, which can swallow now.  You 
can't bind a mouse click to the swallowed window, but a button containing just 
a name underneath would be small.  GUI configuration to boot.

I get  similar  errors from live-icon.el:

[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 130, Error 4, EventType: 0
[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 130, Error 4, EventType: 2

When I tried to  trace it down, it  seemed  like xpm was telling  fvwm
that the icon was invalid.  Of course the icon looks fine.  I captured
the live-icon xpm  and it looked fine  also.  Even though other window
managers don't report this  error, I believe  the problem really is in
XEmacs.

The only advice I can give is use  "contool" for your console process.
You can then configure "contool" to ignore these errors.

Hi,

Last week, I posted a question asking for a mouseless way to switch
among screens.  From the responses I got back, i was clear to me that I
totally botched the question :-(  So, please allow me to try again.

I understand how to jump between desktops, and among pages within a
desktop.  What I'm looking for, is a way to jump between screens in a
multi-screen environment.

when fvwm comes up, it shows me 2 desktop 0s, one in each screen.  I
was hoping there was either a direct way to jump between screens, or a
way to assign desktop 0 to display :0.0 and desktop 1 to screen :0.1,
or a way to assign pages within a desktop to each screen, or...

Anyway, anybody got any ideas?

Thanks,

As I see it, your problem is, that once an application is swallowed, 
X events are handed to it unfiltered (since it could depend on them -
imagine a swallowed pager, which can't receive any mouse event)

The only example I saw, where an action AND a swallow command was
specified, was Jarls example in the man page.
But that's a swallow with a NOP. (capture existing window, or wait 
till a window with that name appears.)
So if no window of that name exists/appears, the "button" is a real 
button, which executes the associated action. 
If the action starts a window with the long-awaited name, the button 
gets REPLACED by the swallowed application, so no more invocations of 
the application are possible.

So I don't think it is possible, what you want to do, unless someone 
modifies FvwmButtons to intercept events for swallowed applications.

That the return does trigger the action... hmm.
Might be that this is because xload sets the Mwmhints input to false 
("I never ever want the keyboard focus." - note: I'm not an X programmer,
I've just been following the discussion here for a long time.)


I just checked: 
	I can reproduce the xload behaviour.
	The action doesn't work, if put on a swallowed perfmeter.
		(this does react to keystrokes.)
	xbiff also refuses keystrokes, and the action works.

Seem like I guessed right with the motif input hint.

Is there any similar hint for mouse input? (some sort of SkipFocus flag?)
Can we simulate that, or can we just filter the Event stream to the
application without any hint.

J> xterm -title top@clove -e top') 
J> ---- End of included text -------------------------8<--- and here -------------

I got this one:

X Error (intercepted): BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
Major Request Code   : 62
Minor Request Code   : 0
Resource ID (XID)    : 31457301
Error Serial Number  : 706

Don't know why the generic mouse action does work, and the mouse n doesn't.

I think Jarl meant NoClose to be used in conjunction with UseOld, in order
to swallow old apps/unswallow them on exit.

But this only works, when I do a "killmodule FvwmButtons" from FvwmTalk.
If I restart Fvwm2, new xbiff/xclock/console/perfmeter are created, while
the old processes are still alive, though they're NOT mapped anywhere.

(And I deleted the -geometry -1500-1500 as well as I set WindowListHit,
ShowMapping, Icon and Title styles.)


hope this triggers some more thoughts.

So we're in for a GotoDisplay feature request.
Now this is the 3rd dimension in the Goto hierarchy:

	Goto ({ Absolute | Relative } { Display | Desk | Page })+

and the 4th dimension in the positioning hierarchy
(if we don't count the internet address components - domain/host):

	Display Desk Page Geometry

who implemented the new Goto and StartsOn syntax?

Could people please check whether their 'xv' shows this bug? I can
reproduce it with xv 3.10 and 3.10a.

I'm increasingly of the opinon that it isn't entirely fvwm's fault. The
bug is reproducable with fvwm1.24, fvwm2 (2.0.42) and twm, but not
with olwm. I haven't got access to mwm to verify Yves's report.

The common point seems to be that fvwm and twm all use ActivePlacement
policies, where as olvm (and presumably mwm) use something like
RandomPlacement. It isn't as simple as this, though: if I put fvwm
into RandomPlacement mode, I still can't get correct behaviour.

Any ideas, chaps (and chapesses!) ?

Austin

Using xv 3.10a, fvwm 2.0.40, and Linux 1.2.13 on an i386-33, I verified
the reported bug (select Grab with HideWindows option; updates to xv
window don't happen until an event [reported example: move window]
occurs), but I found other events which triggered an update of the
display window.  If I move to another desktop and back, or if I execute a 
Recapture, the xv window is updated.  If I move the window it is 
updated.  If I raise or lower the window, it is not updated. I would 
guess that fvwm is not giving xv what it expects when it is grabbing in 
HideWindows mode. Whether fvwm is giving xv all that it should give it, 
and mwm/olwm are giving it extra info which it (incorrectly?) expects is 
another question.

Hey folks,
	I've just installed fvwm 2.0.42 on an HP9000/720 workstation
running HP-UX 9.05 with X11R5 and XPM 3.4g.  I was able to build
it with no problems, but I'm experiencing some strange behavior
while testing it.  I'm using the .fvwmrc file that was provided
by Richard L. Brownrigg in the April 1996 issue of SysAdmin magazine
(I'm not going to include it all here, but I can if it will help).
Anyway, these are the first three lines of the file...

PixmapPath $HOME/images/pixmaps:/usr/local/X11R5/include/X11/pixmaps
IconPath   $HOME/images/bitmaps:/usr/local/X11R5/include/X11/bitmaps
ModulePath /usr/local/X11R5/lib/X11/fvwm

...and later on in the file...

ColormapFocus  FollowsMouse

...then when I start up fvwm, I get these errors...

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/local/X11R5/lib/X11/fvwm PixmapPath
[FVWM][SetColormapFocus]: <<ERROR>> ColormapFocus requires 1 arg: FollowsFocus or FollowsMouse

/bin/sh: syntax error at line 1: `end of file' unexpected

...and I am thoroughly baffled.  Why does it think that PixmapPath is a
module instead of a builtin command?  There's no * in front of the name.
Also, I do have a correct argument to ColormapFocus.  AND...I have no
idea where it's getting that unexpected EOF...there's not one in the
.fvwmrc file, anyway.  Can anyone offer any advice here and earn my
eternal gratitude?  Thanks!

This feature (the UseOld/NoKill) option allows a user to start programs
from their .xsession file and then Swallow them into FvwmButtons.  I
orignally suggested this idea to Jarl because I occasionally have to use
multiple window managers (HP VUE, CDE, et al.) and I only want to have
to start my clocks and xbiffs once.  Using these attributes lets
FvwmButtons grab a window that was running previous to the start of
FvwmButtons and then Release the window when it closes.

The README file in ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/ mentions the

You can specify in the xload that no title be used, then create a small
button above the xload with the name of the machine which can be used to
click on to Exec what you wanted...

For example:

Module FvwmButtons /tmp/configfile

/tmp/configfile:

(9x1, Container(Padding 0 0,Frame 0,Fore black,Back white,Rows 6,Columns 9))
 (1x1,Title m1)
 (1x1,Title m2)
 (1x1,Title m3)
....
 (1x5,Swallow (NoTitle) xload)
....
 (End)

Except that didn't work when I tried it...argh...but you do get the idea
I hope...

Sorry if this is on a FAQ somewhere, if it is, please point me to it.
How do I configure fvwm to switch window colormaps only on a keystroke?
The default behavior is that color maps switch with the window focus,
which if that is bound to the mouse creates a lot of anoyying "flashes"
for some simpleminded color applications.

I just tried making the necessary changes to builtins.c in the fvwm-95
source code (2.0.42) and this did not fix the problem.

Strange, because I tested the changes in fvwm-95 first, then in fvwm-2.0.42
and they work exactly the same way. I'll mail you the patch for fvwm-95.

I have noticed, however, a problem with the above patch while using the
'Prev [*] Focus' command, as a result of moving the focused window to the
top of the list. For example, if you focused on A, B and C windows (in
that order), the first time you use Prev will move you to B, the next time
to C, then B, then C... Of course, that is not the desired behaviour (even
when 'Prev [*] Focus' means exactly that!!). 

Cheers,
Hector.

Chuck

Come the Great Style Flag Rewrite how about a NoIconPixmap style to
complement the existing NoIconTitle?

I currently use fake pixmap names to achieve icons with just the
little title window (e.g. Style "*" none.xpm). Obviously this is
inelegant, but the main problem is that it doesn't work for applications
that supply their own icon (e.g. netscape).

Actually, on the subject of elegance, it would be quite nice to have
a syntax like Jarl's buttons, i.e.:

Style "name"	Element (PropertyList), Element (PropertyList)

e.g.:

Style "Netscape"  Window (NoTitle, Sticky), Icon (Title, Sticky, NoPixmap)

What do you think?

In the meantime, while we wait for the GSFR how about including the
following horrible hack to icons.c which allows us to say 'Icon NoPixmap'
and override the application's icon?

When I am using Prev, I expect it to go backwards through the "focus 
history". However, if I've used it to go from C to B (as in your example), 
and worked in B for a while, I would then expect to go back to C. If I'd 
used Prev twice in quick succession (e.g. less than half a second between 
uses), I'd expect to end up at A.

Perhaps fvwm should have some sort of FocusTimeDelay field to implement this 
behaviour. This delay would be the length of time a window must have focus 
before it's raised to the top of the "focus history". This would also cover 
the problem of moving your mouse accross from one side of your window to the 
other in MouseFocus mode. Alternatively, applications only get raised in the 
history when they receive input (either via mouse click or key press).

What do you think?

Hi.

	I am using:

Style "*" ClickToFocus
Style "*" SloppyFocus

	My problem is that when I move the mouse around, the focus
immediately moves from window to window. This causes me problems some
times. What I would like is for the focus to change to a new window
only after the mouse has been on the window for a while (to be defined
by a parameter). Is there such a thing ?


TIA.

Chuck, here's another bug fix for icons without a pixmap.

PROBLEM:
If an icon without a pixmap is deiconified it comes up underneath
all other windows on the screen.

CAUSE:
In RaiseWindow(), if there's no icon_pixmap_w then NULL gets pushed
onto the wins[] array, screwing up the call to XRestackWindows().

TO FIX:
Test for icon_pixmap_w != NULL first. Here's the patch.

Yup, I fixed this one about 1-2 months ago.  Strangely enough, my
patch was almost exactly yours :)

Hi.

	Here's what happens:

	1. I bring up xman.
	2. I click on the Manual Page button, and get the Manual Page
window.
	3. I click on the Options button and get the Xman Options
window.
	4. I drag the mouse down.

	5. nothing happens.

	When I do the same thing under mwc, the items on the Manual
Page window get highlighted, and I can choose the item I want by
releasing the mouse button.

	I am running fvwm version 2.0.42 on Digital Unix (OSF) version
3.2c.

TIA.

The problem discussed here (originally found in 1.24r) is also in recent
versions of fvwm2 in the modules that do CPP or M4 processing of .fvwm2rc
files.

Since this is a generic problem, I'm notifying you guys of it in hopes that
you'll come up with a fix.  I don't like the fix proposed by the author,
however it certainly works.  I think a better fix would be to fork and
create pipes by hand and use mkstemp to hold temporary information and
avoid the race condition.

Security problems with mktemp race condition.

There is a good bit of stuff done between the mktemp() and the actual usage of
the temporary file, so this bug is not very difficult to exploit.  This bug
could allow another local user to execute commands as you, when you start FVWM.

This should take care of it.  This is a slightly cleaned up version of
the fix by Debian/GNU Linux.

 BSD provides mkstemp() to handle this problem properly.  I'm not sure of
 it's history, but it is old enough to be in FreeBSD-1.1.5.
 
 I tried exploiting the bug in mktemp() pointed out by Josh the other day
 (mk[s]temp() uses stat(), not lstat(), so mktemp() can return a filename
 that is a symlink.  This doesn't seem to be a problem for mkstemp()
 since O_EXCL in the open flags stop all (?) existing directory entries
 from being openable).

 I think the O_EXCL method is better.  Except of course if you really
 want a directory or another type of non-regular file.  It's surprisingly
 hard to get the interface for temporary file [name] creation right.
 FreeBSD has 5 BAD interfaces: tempnam(), tmpfile(), tmpnam(), mktemp()
 and mkstemp().

consequently, at the restart of fvwm2 the new fvwmButtons should be able to
recapture the same window (process).
But the problem is that the window is lost.
The process still exists, but there is no mapping on any page.

so the new FvwmButton (in doubt) creates a new xclock/xbiff, every time I
restart.

Unswallowing only works correctly, if I do a killmodule FvwmButtons from
FvwmTalk.

Aha! I should have checked the archive first :-). Strange that I missed
your fix when it was first posted ... I must have read that message
before my first coffee of the day!

Incidentally, I note Chuck said this doesn't happen under AIX. Is it
a bug in some implementations of XRestackWindows(), not treating the
array index i as authoritative and stopping at NULL array members?
Or a feature :-)   I'm on Irix 6.2 (X11R6).

<criticism>
I was just musing on the fact that Fvwm2 is headed for an official 
release soon, and I don't think (to be brutally frank) that it 
is ready.

There are several buglets still in it, but the main problem is that
(as in the xman post earlier today) many apps are 'broken' with
fvwm. Now, I like fvwm and am happy to use a few workabouts, but
I know people who changed back from fvwm to another wm.

The problems occur with things like xman menus, Sun's filemgr
menus vanishing, Sun's mailtool acting oddly and so on.

All other WM's cope with these apps happily, these fvwm/menu problems
severly impact on the usefulness of these apps.
For example, xman is often rendered useless. Not good enough.

Its not enough to say 'App X is broken or buggy'. If other WM's
can cope then fvwm must be seen to cope until such time as a better
app is widely used. If it bloats the code...tough, broken WM's are
little use! :-)

</criticism>

Fvwm is still my WM of choice though, this post *is* supposed to
be constructive.

And will the next beta have StartsOnPage? :-)

The key binding bug (inactive after certain ops, needs focus
to go to a window and back to root to cure) can be fairly
serious as well. No point having keyboard shortcuts if they
don't always work...

Yes.

I am the Debian fvwm maintainer, and have given some patches to Chuck
to be put into the next release. I did this almost as soon as
fvwm2-2.0.42 was released, and Chuck is aware of the security problem
(it just that the next beta is still being put together by Chuck).

My original fix for Debian was the less efficient directory creation
based one.  This is the one you have decided to comment on. If you
look at the currect Debian fvwm and fvwm2 packages, you'll see that
they both your the O_EXCL fix, which is far cleaner.

Much better still would be (as you say) to fork off a subprocess and
use pipes. I may well give Chuck a patch for this at some point.

While you're at it, could you please point the BSD people at the
latest Debian fvwm package?  I never thought my nasty directory based
hack would spread this far... :)

I posted it on 19th April. I still have my original emails, which I
include below.

Yes, I think it's due to some X servers attempting to protect
themselves from poorly written programs :)

Ok, I've got a fix for it:

Basically, what was happening was that when building a list of windows
to be raised, it would include icon_pixmap_w, which was a NULL (since
the window had no icon).

The list of windows to be raised was passed to the X server in the
  XRestackWindows(dpy,wins,i);
call. In this call, X was taking the NULL in wins to mean the end of
the list, rather than relying on i. Since the main window is in wins[]
after the NULL, it never got re-stacked.

I must admit that I didn't experience this problem while I was BETA
testing Jarl's patches.  Unfortunately, the machines I was using at the
time are in Oregon, and I have returned to classes here in Kentucky.
I'll try and play around today and see if I can duplicate this.

BTW, *ANYONE* able to duplicate any of the BUGS I have reported
involvinging the FvwmPager Module being Swallowed by FvwmButtons?
Specifically using the Swallow(Respawn) Attribute and trying to move
windows in between the desktops ON the pager?

Lots of people have said xman works fine, or that there is no problem with it.
Odd, I can start xman, get a manual page up, but thats it.

I can't use either menu, so I can't actually get to a manual page or
browse through commands. To me, this is broken! Maybe its not a
widespread problem. Lets see, I have Solaris 2.5 and openwin 3.?
I'll just go and check that using different mouse buttons etc doesn't fix
it. Nope. Xman might as well be a static picture for all the use I can
get out of it. I have the last fvwm beta, compiled as normal, no patches.
I can get the menus up in xman, I just cannot select anything in either
options or sections. Hence, no use! :-)

I thought that xman would be a better example than say, the Sun tools,
many of which exhibit problems, especially with menus. The menus
problem is really annonying! Maybe I was a bit rash saying it renders many
programs useless, but it certainly inhibits their full use. :-)

In filemgr for example (Sun's fine File Mangler) some option menus
just vanish behind the main window. Hard to set options then!

strongly seconded.
much clearer, better separation of elements.
Since the elements seem to represent some sort of window "states"
(when-to-use), I'd prefer "Iconified (NoIcon)" over Icon (NoIcon). 

How many such "states" do we have?

	Start:		Iconic/Normal/Maximized,
			Display #/CurrentDisplay, 
			Desk #/Currentdesk,
			Page # #/CurrentPage.

	Window:		NoTitle/Title, NoButton/Button #, BorderWidth #,
			NoHandles/Handles, HandleWidth #, 
			StaysOnTop/StaysOnBottom/StaysPut, 
			Color #/# /ForeColor #/BackColor #

	Iconified:	Title/NoTitle, NoIcon/Icon Str, Sticky/Slippery
	Windowlist:	WindowListSkip/WindowListHit

	IconBox:	#/# #/# (coordinates)

	maybe more for additional module-styles ? -> see below

#   ... number
Str ... String Parameter

ok, I threw in some things from the todolist (start maximized &
Display/Page Note: StartsAnyWhere is the equivalent of CurrentDisplay
& CurrentDesk & CurrentPage) and some things I (and others too, as we
already talked about most of them) would like to see. 

all of these extensions are for completeness (Start options) or
symmetry (StaysOnBottom, can be used to inset an Xload into the
X background without decoration, without ever gaining focus, without
ever being raised. - I used that before I used GoodStuff/FvwmButtons.)

btw: there was some SkipFocus flag mentioned somewhere, was that real,
it isn't mentioned in the docs.

sure does reduce tokens, that have to be recognized (both for the
parser and for the humans writing config files) and makes things
clearer.



comments ?






one more strange Idea regarding styles:
what about dynamically allocating style flags, when parsing the
.fvwm2rc file.


I envision :-) the following:

Wile parsing the .fvwm2rc, style bits are allocated in the order of
appearance, with the proper handling function being recorded in a
global static array of identifiers, and one variable per style flag,
telling the actual allocated position. (this is some data, but it's
not per window, but once for entire fvwm2) 
This variables are used for indirection, when a specific flag is to be
obtained.

e.g: after
	Style "*" Window (NoTitle), Icon (NoTitle, Sticky), \
		  Start (Page 2 3, Desk 1, Display 0)

the arrays would look like:
	BitArray[32] = { WindowTitle, IconTitle, IconSticky,
					0,0,0, ... }
	ParameterArray[10] = { 0, 1, 2/3 }
	
	WindowTitleBit	0
	IconTitlebit	1
	IconStickyBit	2

	StartPageParameter	0	
	StartDeskParameter	1
	StartDisplayParameter	2

the default window structure would look like:

	StyleBits: 0 0 1
	StyleParameters: 515(=2*256+3) 1 0


and If I want to know the setting of the IconTitle bit in the code, 
I use 
	(WindowTitleBit >=0 ? 
		(window_struct -> StyleBits) & (1 << WindowTitleBit) :
		DefaultWindowTitleBit	/* this is #define'ed somewhere */

(well this would certainly go into a little C++ class, or the
C-equivalent:  an extraction macro/function ;-)			)


Who needs this, anyway ?

	Well it'd extend the support for modules. Fvwm2 could
	handle abstract module-specific style bits for every
	window. And since nobody (at least nobody sane) would
	modify all styles of all modules, very little window
	structure-space would be needed. 
	And if someone tried to use all possible style options, 
	he'd simply get an "Out of style flags" error, since 
	that's	what he deserves.

	The module would have to register an array of 
	(Style_name #Parameters Command AllocatedPlace) where

	Style_name is the text needed for parsing, 
	Parameters is the number of parameters for that style (0 if binary)
	Command is a command to send to the module, when a window with
		that style is created, and
	AllocatedPlace is set to the bit number (number of 1st
		parameter) in the window structure that was allocated
		for that style by fvwm. (this is the equivalent of
		WindowTitleBit for that module style)

	well the registering could be a problem, but could be done via
	a ~/.fvwm-module-styles (ack), if we leave out AllocatedPlace
	from the structure and let the module query, if it should need
	this info. Maybe someone has a better idea for this ?


Pro:
	it doesn't bloat the window structure, as the total number of
	style flags can be limited to say 32 binary and 10 with a
	parameter (nobody uses all combinations of all flags).
	Maybe a little bit more, don't know exactly, how much is
	needed. 

	One could make the UseStyle a style with a parameter and do
	runtime lookups, if the current option isn't overridden
	locally - well maybe this is a space saving functionality, but
	certainly not an acceleration ;-(

	It'd allow any thinkable extension using styles from modules.

	
Con:
	no data bloatage, but tradoff
		speed penalty (function) - code bloatage (macros) 

	sure someone can add something here ;-)


chuck, what do you mean?
worth more thoughts?
"A Module doesn't need own styles!" ?  hmmmm.... ;^)

Just a note here that certain Motif pulldowns (I have noted only those 
that are "within the window special function things" malfunctioning; when 
the same menus are bound to buttons in the menu bar they work properly) 
also drop behind the main window.  As a note which may be a clue to the 
knowledgeable, this behavior used to be an "all the time" thing. Of late, 
with greater loading of the machines I use, it often happens that the 
menus do not always drop behind the windows.  This indicates that the 
behavior is influenced by timing and machine load (which is a bad thing 
in itself).

  It almost sounds as though xman may be unable to find its
app-defaults. I say almost because you mention that you `can get the
menus up in xman'. Of course, if xman works for you under another
window manager (or no window manager), then this is not the problem.

Are you using FvwmAuto?  If so, if you don't use it do you still have
the problem?  How about if you use a shorter time value for it?

I know a lot of people have seen problems like this with FvwmAuto.
I'll have to see if I can come up with a fix, but since I have trouble
reproducing the problem, that may be difficult.

Opps - may have spoke too soon.  I was just able to reproduce it, but
only when I first give the window focus (I use click to focus) and
click on the menu to give it focus and pop up the menu at the same
time.  If the window already has focus, the menus pop up fine for me.

I switched xman to SloppyFocus and it was harder to reproduce, but I
got it to do so once.

I'll have to play with FvwmAuto some more when I get a chance to see
if I can prevent this problem.

  I've no problem with solaris 2.5 X11R5 Fvwm-2.0.42.
Do you have the num lock key pressed? Try to press it and test xman again.
I had a similiar problem some time ago, on an Indy using mwm. The problem
was the same with all the programs using the athena (Xaw) widget set.
If the num-lock is active, you can see menus but you can't select them.
Again, I repeat that I had this problem with mwm.

  I tested here and I have the same problem as you If I enable the numlock
key. This seems to be a problem of the athena widget set. Does anybody can
confirm this?

My restart function now looks like this:

The wait is necessary to allow time for the regurgitation to complete.

Well, hang my head in shame.  I was using 2.0.41.  I now have 2.0.42 and
the new FvwmButtons is great.  I have a title on my swallowed xloads so I
can run programs at the click of a mouse button.

BTW the new container stuff has made it much easier to have arbitrary
button geometry.

Oh bugger. You're right! I have everything else in fvwm bound to
work with or without numlock, so I keep forgetting I have that key!
Duh!

The filemgr bug etc is still there though. In that case the menu
just vanishes though. It doesn't appear to flick behind a window
due to fvwmauto though, it just vanishes. I'll test it sometime
without fvwmauto on perhaps.

I just tried this under Solaris 2.3 (x11r5 and fvwm-2.0.40), and sure enough
with the num-lock active none of the menus worked.

Just as a wild guess, do either of you use FvwmAuto (autoraise)?
That's the only time it has happened to me.  AFAICT, the problem I'm
seeing is inherent with that (and I can live with it without problems).

Nope....Personally, I can't stand AutoRaise.  I like to stack windows,
using those which are partially exposed for inputs and others which are
closer to the top as monitors (in the control system for our electron
accelerator, for instance).  I use focus-follows-mouse.  The source of my
Motif widget problem seems to be that mouse-hits popping up these menus
also induce a window-raise command, which is usually but (of late) not
always executed *after* the menu popup.  (I don't know how to do X [or
even C; i'm illiterate] programming or I'd probably figure out how to fix
this myself, either in the relevant Motif programs or in fvwm's Motif-ish
modes).  Oh well, maybe when the accelerator is finally perfect....  I'm 
currently thinking the problem is not a direct consequence of Motif, but 
of the way the affected apps are written.  However, since mwm/HPVUE 
handle them well even though fvwm/twm don't, there must be a way.

Interesting.  If you are using FocusFollowsMouse and don't run
FvwmAuto, it shouldn't be raising the window when you click in it,
only if you click on the titlebar and you have that mouse binding set
up to raise it.  I just tried this with a motif program that had a
menubar and had no problems.  But then, as you said, perhaps your
particular program is coded to raise itself.

ClickToFocus windows will raise by default if you click in them, on
the other hand.  I've added a remark to the TO-DO list to make a way
to control that...

Also, I put in a fix to FvwmAuto which makes it work ok with
ClickToFocus windows, although I doubt many people use that
combination.  That'll be in the next beta.  FocusFollowsMouse windows
may be a little harder - still looking into that.

Hi! This is from Yujong Kim, a graduate student of POSTECH, KOREA.
I want to know how I can make columns and rows's line of FvwmPager solid line.
I make my DeskTopSize 3x3 ( FvwmPager # 0 ). but at that FvwmPager, 
lines which separate coloums and rows are dotted lines not solid lines.
I want to be those line soild.  How  can I make cure that problem ?
My machine is SUN sparc station. OS is solaris 2.5 with X11R5.  
My fvwm version is fvwm-2.0.42.  I don't use 3d_pixmaps_1.0.tar.gz.
In my fvwm version 1 case, those lines are  solid line. 
So I think that the problem maybe a bug of fvwm-2.0.42.
Please, Help me !
Below file is my ".fvwm2rc" file. Please search for what problem is 
there at that file.
I hope to receive your answer soon. 

from Yujong Kim.

> Lots of people have said xman works fine, or that there is no problem with

here is a couple of questions for my own curiosity.

What X resources do you have set?  Some window managers (olvwm) run a
special init script or something (.openwin-init) that will setup special
X resources...

Try comparing the X resources while running fvwm to olvwm...perhaps xman
doesn't have anything bound to the menu options?  I have toyed with x
resources and rendered menu options usless without understanding how...so
that would be my best guess there..

It isn't specially fvwm's fault, but the fact that window managers (ahem)
openwin, tend to do a little more cludgy X startup than just putting things
in .xinitrc where they belong...

Another question.  Would those people who use xman that have problems please
mention the version?

I have xman 3.1.6, linux 2.0.0, running the latest X11R6.1 XFree86 3.1.2e 
beta X server (whew!), and fvwm-2.0.42 without any problems...and since there
are others in the world who don't seem to have problems, my first hunch
is there are several X resources /  environment variable differences.

Try doing an 'xrdb -merge /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Xman' and see if
that does any good.

Hrm, what happens if you mess with click-to-focus and such for these apps?  Are
you having the app itself raise when it gets focus and push-pinning the menu
to the desktop underneath the app?

Just some curiosities of my own on the matter..

I know that the version 1 is frozen but 2 is still in beta...

We use fvwm 1.24r on several UNIXes and we see some core dumps on some
systems like Digital/UNIX or Solaris 2. Did anybody out there see this
kind of problems? Is there any (even unofficial) patch to 1.24r?

(please reply directly to me, I'll summarise)

Thanks in advance for your help,

No, I believe it's a feature which came with 2.0.42. I suppose the idea is
to make it easier to distinguish pages from desks in the pager.

Could you be a little more specific as to what the problem is?

I do know of one crash situation in 1.24r if you are using
ClickToFocus and try to close several windows at once, and I do have a
fix for that if that is the problem.

Yup - that was the idea.  There was no way to truly distinguish
between pages and full desks.  Now there's two - dashed lines and
optional colored backgrounds for each desk.

There is currently no way to control this in the .fvwm2rc file - it's
hard coded into the FvwmPager module, and I didn't really have any
intention on making it an option.  If you (Yujong) would like to
change it back to being solid, you only have to change like one line -
check out line 390 of x_pager.c in the FvwmPager directory.  If you
change that LineOnOffDash to LineSolid, it'll look like it did before.

oops, I never thought of a timing bug.
the wait really solves this problem:
I now have:

instead of:

+	"I"	Restart /net/vta_host/home/vta_host/albrecht/bin/fvwm2

thanks,

On Digital/UNIX, the crashes are random and there is no obvious
pattern.

On Solaris 2, two different users reported crashes in different
situations. The first one was connected to the use of the tool
tkpostage (with some home-made modifications): when tkpostage queried
the mail server frequently (1/min), fvwm crashed randomly after some
time. Without tkpostage, nor more crashes... The user will use again
tkpostage to get a core dump, it may give a clue...

The other one is connected to the use of Netscape and FrameMaker,
here are some mails extracts:

I don't know if it does...  But I'll give you the patch here that
fixes the coredump that I mentioned, which may or may not help you.
The change is pretty small and it shouldn't hurt at all.

Otherwise, you might want to pick up the latest 2.xx beta (2.0.42,
with 2.0.43 out shortly and the first official release 2.1.0 out
hopefully soon after that) and give it a try (see

                     http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/

for info).

Ok, I've added an option to control it.

*FvwmPagerInterPageLineStyle <linestyle>

Changes the style of lines drawn between individual pages on the same
desk. The default is to have inter-desk boundaries drawn with solid
lines, and inter-page boundaries dotted. However, if you only use a
single desk, you might want to set the line style some something
else. Possible values for <linestyle> are "Solid",
"OnOffDash" (the default), or "DoubleDash".

The patch follows. I've included a change to FvwmPager.man, so it even
comes ready-documented.

Chuck, any chance of this going into the next beta?  :>

Dear All,
	I just spent the last hour doing a binary search on my .fvwmrc
to find out why it was crashing.  The line in question turned out to be:

Mouse 3 W M ResizeIconify

The conflict is with then 2.0.42 FvwmPager which uses Alt-Mouse3 for dragging
windows around.  Is there a way to stop the conflicts as I really like both.

Cheers,
Tim.

hi,

using xv 3.10a, fvwm 2.0.42, solaris 2.4 on an ultrasparc, i also can
see this behavior (xv window not being updated unless you do something
to the window).

again, as noted by michael tiefenback, the xv window gets updated if i
move it (either within a page or between desktops), but not on a
raise/lower. interestingly, if i do the grab, then move to another
page within a desktop, the xv window refreshes *and* follows me to
that page, even though i'm not doing a "sticky-move" type of
operation....

(this may of course be unrelated to the original behavior described.)

Well, besides the READMEs and man pages, there is a sample .fvwm2rc,
which you can use as a start point.

RTFM (and also check out http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/).  The docs in
the tar file *should* provide you with all the info you need, and the
web page has pointers to different configuration examples.

It does?  Not to my knowledge it doesn't, and even if it did, it would
only be within the pager window itself, so there still wouldn't be a
conflict.  There must be something else happening here.

I have another problem with fvwm and xv. If I have xv displaying something
in a window, and restart fvwm, the xv window displaying the graphic will
move up to the upper-left corner of the screen. When fvwm comes back, the
window stays there. This happens to any number of xv windows I have up,
but only (I think) to the ones that display a picture. Other xv windows
don't do this. This is with fvwm 2.0.42, xv 3.10a, on a linux box. It's
really annoying, especially when a small xv window moves up to the corner
and gets hidden behind my fvwmbuttons..

Hello,

I have two quesions concerning icons in menu-labels:

1) I noticed that when using:
"Calculator%xcalc.xpm%"
the text to the right of the icon in not centered vertically with
respect to the icon height... this shows up when the icon is taller
than the font used... would it be easy to make them centered? I know
this really *is* a detail... just wondering!

2) How big of an overload is it to add icons to menu labels? I only
added a few so far without noticable change in speed... any idea?

Thanks!

PS: i use fvwm-2.0.42 on a Linux system.

>From what I can tell, fvwm keeps a linked list of keybindings and mouse bindings
that are all applied to each window that is captured at the time the window
is captured, and at no other time.

This behavior is ok if you are not:

a) redefining keybindings
b) playing games that require 'dumping' keybindings
c) anything else similar...

Let me explain.

Like 'Style "*" NoTitle', 'Key Left A M -10 +0' does not take effect until
I either recapture every window, or popup a new window, which then has the
desired effect.  My guess is this has something to do with the X protocol or
a per window info fvwm keeps track of or something...

What I would like to point out that should (imho) be on the todo list is
the ability to undefine a keybinding or mouse binding.  Currently, when one
defines a keybinding, it is added to a linked list of keybindings...but I see
no way currently to remove it from this list.  For example, if I want to
define a function as below, I cannot:

AddToFunc run_a_game
+ "I" Key Left A M (undefine)
+ "I" Key Right A M (undefine)
+ "I" Key Up A M (undefine)
+ "I" Key Down A M (undefine)
+ "I" Key Left A C (undefine)
+ "I" Key Right A C (undefine)
+ "I" Key Up A C (undefine)
+ "I" Key Down A C (undefine)
+ "I" Key Left A SC (undefine)
+ "I" Key Right A SC (undefine)
+ "I" Key Up A SC (undefine)
+ "I" Key Down A SC (undefine)
+ "I" Key Left A SM (undefine)
+ "I" Key Right A SM (undefine)
+ "I" Key Up A SM (undefine)
+ "I" Key Down A SM (undefine)
+ "I" Exec $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6
+ "I" Wait $1
+ "I" Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 0
+ "I" Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
+ "I" Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
+ "I" Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100
+ "I" Key Left        A       M       Scroll -10 +0
+ "I" Key Right       A       M       Scroll +10 +0
+ "I" Key Up          A       M       Scroll +0   -10
+ "I" Key Down        A       M       Scroll +0   +10
+ "I" Key Left        A       SC      CursorMove -1 0
+ "I" Key Right       A       SC      CursorMove +1 +0
+ "I" Key Up          A       SC      CursorMove +0   -1
+ "I" Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove +0   +1
+ "I" Key Left        A       SM      CursorMove -10 +0
+ "I" Key Right       A       SM      CursorMove +10 +0
+ "I" Key Up          A       SM      CursorMove +0   -10
+ "I" Key Down        A       SM      CursorMove +0   +10

(at least I don't see any way to do this...).

Currently, to get around this, when I go to play Doom or
quake, I must restart fvwm, as I (at startup) don't have the
keys bound to anything...I use a menu option to read the
keybindings file...

Anyone want to tackle this?  I kindof know what needs to
happen (if a keybinding 'function' is a '-', for example,
and it is in the linked list of keybindings, remove and
free it...) but I'm not sure if I understand X or fvwm
well enough to pull it off gracefully...

Anyone willing to help here?

Hi:

I have compiled fvwm-2.0.42 and now I am trying to use it. My
workstation is running solaris 2.5. In my startup file, I replaced
command /usr/openwin/bin/openwin with /usr/local/X11R6/bin/fvwm2.
For some reason it just won't start and I keep getting the error
message:

ld.so.1: /usr/local/X11R6/bin/fvwm2: fatal: libXpm.so.4.8: can't open file: errno=2

does anyone know what is wrong? Is it possible that something wrong
when I compiled the source? for example, like Fvwm.tmpl configuration....
It would be very gradfull if someone could give me some ideas..

Thanks inadvance..

Ming

PS: I used generic system.fvwmrc as my .fvwmrc.

Hi there,

I use unclutter which after a period of not moving the mouse makes the
mouse pointer invisible.  Before I used it, it always seemed that my
mouse pointer was obscuring exactly that part of my xterm where I
wanted to type :-|

Anyway, I have discovered an interaction between keybindings and
unclutter:

IF unclutter has made the mouse pointer invisible
AND the mouse pointer is on the frame of a window
THEN key bindings don't work.

To illustrate: in .fvwm2rc I have

    Key m A 3 WindowList

which lets me hit Alt-m to get the Window list in any context.  If the
mouse pointer is invisible and if it is on the frame of a window,
Alt-m gets passed thru to the application.  This happens with 2.0.42
on Debian Linux as well as SunOS 4.1.4 (MIT X11R6).

When the mouse pointer is visible or if it is invisible but within a
window, everything is just dandy.

Strange, strange.

Have you got any ideas?

tia,
kai

How do I change sessions between an xterm and a console terminal and
vice versa? I am talking about the sessions like switching from MS
Windows and DOS.

I am using fvwm 1.24. Is this feature a part of the window manager or
part of xdm?

TIA.

CH> It does?  Not to my knowledge it doesn't, and even if it did, it would

If I comment out the line everything is fine, if I don't I get this error:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
  Serial number of failed request:  942
  Current serial number in output stream:  943

It may be a race condition at startup since Fvwm doesn't process any keyboard
events until the InitFunction is done even though it is handling windows.  I
haven't done much testing but it may be due to me running the pager
inside a FvwmButtons bar (the pager flashes on to the screen before being
swallowed).

Hope this helps,
Tim Phipps.

Neither nor.  You can switch between the virtual consoles with the
Alt-F keys.  Alt-F1 is the first console, Alt-F2 the second, and so
on.

Within X, this has been rebound to Ctrl-Alt-F-key, so while running X
you can switch back to the first console with Ctrl-Alt-F1 and so on.

To switch *to* X, you must choose the first virtual console that
doesn't exist.  Often, people have six virtual consoles (Alt-F1 thru
Alt-F6), so Alt-F7 is where they find X.

This is all part of the Linux console driver, but some X support is
required, too.

Btw, Ctrl-Alt-Backspace unconditionally terminates the X server,
useful in case there is some emergency.

That is all only under Linux.  Some other OS's have virtual terminal
support, but are accessed & behave differently.  For example, AIX uses
ALT-RightCtrl to cyclically switch between virtual terminals, but only
if you 'open' them explicitly.

Kai> Btw, Ctrl-Alt-Backspace unconditionally terminates the X server,
Kai> useful in case there is some emergency.

This should be for all X servers and there is a way to disable it as
well, I believe.

You should have read the TO-DO list, as this is in there.  :)

I'll get to it eventually if someone else doesn't mail me a patch for

It shouldn't be too bad, as long as you don't go crazy.  The more
different XPMs you use in the menus, the more colors & memory it'll
eat up.  But if they are all relatively small and use similiar colors,
even a lot of different ones shouldn't cause any problems at all.

I do have something related in the TO-DO list already:

  - Setting Key's via FvwmTalk or Read requires Recapture to take effect?

and I planned to look into that, as it doesn't seem necessary to me.

I agree that there should be a way to dynamically unbind them as well,
so I'm adding that to the TO-DO list right now.

This is system dependent too. If you want to disable it under Linux,
put a "DontZap" in your XF86Config.

Chuck,

I have been wondering about multi columns in the menus and found this
mentioned in the to-do list under "NEW".

So is this something I can look forward to after the official release of 2.1?

Also while looking thru the archives, I noticed a reference to an olvwm
feature that will create a menu from a directory of executables (e.g.
$HOME/bin).  Is there any plan for this feature.

One final thing.  I would like to thank you Chuck and all of the
providers for this wonderful window manager.  I really don't know how I
ever functioned here at work without it.

Hi there,

I wish the old twm way of mouse button 3 doing interesting things when
actively placing a window would be back.  I know that I can use button
2 to do that, but it's just not the same.

:-)

In case you're wondering what I'm talking about:  turn on
ActivePlacement, open a new window.  You get to drag the outline, then
  - mouse 1 places the window there immediately
  - mouse 2 lets you resize the window first and places it when you
    release the button
Other twm derivatives have
  - mouse 3 does a vertical zoom (actually, a bottom zoom, similar to
    dragging the bottom edge right to the bottom of the screen)

tia,
kai

I sent a patch for this to the list last month.  
Here's the message again:

Subject: Patch to vertically center menu text

One of the items on the fvwm2-TO.DO list is:

  - Make left justified pixmaps in menus center align vertically w/
    any text displayed?

It seems that small pixmaps are already centered with larger text, but
text is not centered with larger pixmaps.
So here is a small patch to fix the vertical alignment.

I have a setup that does this, although not automatically.  It can't
be done completely automatically, since some programs must be run inside
an xterm, other need special arguments, and so on.  In practice, most
programs need special handling.  I use a configuration file to create the
menus, with one line per menu entry.  This allows me to add any suitable
options for each program, and also to put in a mini-icon before the menu
entry.  A bit like Win95, actually. :-)

My setup should still be in 
http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2config-0.1.tar.gz and
http://www.iki.fi/liw/misc/fvwm2debian-0.1.tar.gz .  It's been working
splendidly for me.

As soon as I have the time, I will start working on getting this into the
Debian Linux distribution (and possibly the master fvwm distribution, but
I'm not sure Chuck wants it there).

Ditto.  If Robert or Chuck ever show up in Helsinki, I'd like to buy them
a beer.  (Beer is a metasyntactic variable, and is meant to be replaced
with a suitable drink with or with alcohol.)

[ It's so nice to say things like that, since I know the chance of them
showing up is infinitesimal :-) ]

I saw some icons somewhere that were "photo quality".
Ex: the terminal icon looked more like a photo of a
workstation than a paintbrush file.

Please send me an email if you know where I can 
these icons (I'm no longer on the list because most 
of the discussions have been regarding fvwm2, we only 
have 1.24 where I work).

Thanks,
Kevin

Cool.

However, I don't know how we can 'put this into use' but it is almost a
feature that a recapture is required to re-do the 'per-window' information.

For example, I like most of my rxvt's to have titles.  But some of them
I don't.  How do I do this?

1) a menu option with 'Style "rxvt" NoTitle'
2) Exec rxvt
3) a different menu option with 'Style "rxvt" Title'

This gets me what I want...and this would break if immediately changing the
style of rxvt's to not have a title meant every rxvt suddenly had no title..

Would it be possible to create a module that lets us look at all of the
'per-window' settings, and dynamically change this?

I know there is FvwmConifig, and another person working on a tcl/tk script
to configure fvwm based on the rc files....it would really be nice to be
able to spawn a Module like 'FvwmProperties' for instance, either stand-alone
to modify global settings, or based upon a window, to examine and modify
just it's attributes...

This pretty much breaks down into:

a) Is there a protocol defined that allows modules to find out EVERYTHING
   based upon a window id #, like 'does it have a title right now', 'what
   keybindings does it have right now', etc?  Ifnot, would it be useful
   to implement?
b) Is it possible for modules to change the above info?
c) Is it possible to do a per-window (i.e. not EVERY window) recapture?

If I'm not making any sense, please let me know...

You misunderstand me slightly, I think.  Key & mouse bindings don't
apply to individual windows, but everywhere based on the context
(i.e. global info).  That shouldn't require a recapture, but does
right now as you observed.  Recaptures would still be required for
window specific info to take effect, and I don't intend to change
that, as that makes sense.

But, I'd like to make a way to recapture an individual window, so you
can make changes (like your removing of the titlebar) on individual
existing windows, which you mentioned at the end of your note as well.

Well, gotta get to some meetings...

Later,

Sort of.  There will probably be a way to read the output of an
executable, so you could make a small shell script to create the menu
entries from a directory's contents.  I plan to put that in the next
beta, which is only one away from 2.1 if all goes well, although I am
trying to minimize the amount of new stuff going it between now and
then, so it might wait until slightly after 2.1 is released.  Still
haven't fully decided...

No problem.  I felt the same way after I started using fvwm.

I have been using the cwdcmd feature in tcsh to dynamically change the 
titles of my xterms. Currently I have X setup so that I have a 
"controller" xterm....To quit X I exit/kill/destroy this particular Xterm 
and the window manager/X/apps go down. 
In my .xsession I label the "controller" xterm CONTROLLER, but when my .cshrc 
executes, cwdcmd overrides the title set in my .xsession with the -title 
switch and changes the name of the xterm. I have tried inserting a -e 
switch in the xterm call so that I could execute a special script or set 
an enviornment variable to identify the controller xterm or change the 
cwdcmd alias for that xterm, but it didn't work. I have 2 major problems.

1. Any attempt to set an enviornment variable from the -e fails. (ie. setenv 
CONTROLLER 1). 
2. The .cshrc and shell setup scripts execute AFTER whatever I specify in 
the xterm call with the -e switch.

	From these observations an various experiments I thought that if 
I could read the title of the xterm within my .cshrc and use it (the 
title) in an if statement I could then have the cwdcmd changed for that 
specific xterm.

SO, my question is:
	How do you get the title of an xterm from within a shell script??

Any other solutions to this problem??

	TIA,
		Jonathan Watson

I don't know how minimal people want fvwm to be, but this sort of thing is
already do-able with m4.  eg.

  define(`a_temporary_file',maketemp(`TMPDIR/fvwmincludedXXXXX'))
  syscmd(`system-command with options >' a_temporary_file)
  include(a_temporary_file)
  syscmd(rm a_temporary_file)

Of course, then you need to use m4, and it's not as clean as it could be
(though you could write a macro to clean it up! :-) ), but I use this
technique multiple times in my .fvwm2rc.* files.  BTW, m4 does *not* have
any asynchronous issues like the discussion about the Read command pointed
out for it.  You just have to learn m4, which can take a couple hours to
get comfortable with.

Works for Bash builtin echo.

This is more a shell/X problem than an fvwm problem.

I'm not familiar with tcsh, but cwdcmd sounds similar to the precmd() function
in Z Shell. Mine looks like this:

    precmd () {
            print -Pn "^[]0;${XTERMNAME}%M   %l   %5.^G"
    }

This yields a string in the titlebars and icons of my xterms that looks like
"belldandy   p1   ~" (hostname, tty, current directory).

The XTERMNAME variable is the trick here. Normally it's unset. For my console
xterm (I have a setup like Jon's for session control), I use this in my
.xsession:

    XTERMNAME="CONSOLE: " xterm +ut -C -fn 5x8

Then my titlebar looks like "CONSOLE: belldandy   p1   ~". Since I set the
variable right before I run the xterm, it doesn't get propagated to subshells.
I can also use it for other kinds of xterms, if needed.

I don't know how you'd do this in tcsh. The % macros used in zsh's print
command won't be the same, but the use of XTERMNAME should be similar.

Nethack does something which seems to display a problem in fvwm,
versions 1.24 and 2.0.42.

Nethack/X11 displays a lot of small windows (eg 266x18) to ask about
actions, to display more input, etc.  In some cases, it pops up
several of these windows in succession, for further input.  When it
does this, there is a large pause between the windows.  (The main
nethack window doesn't refresh, NH seems stuck.)  If I cause NH to
open a larger window (like an inventory window) to break up a sequence
of smaller windows, there is no such problem.

There is no such problem with twm.  What information would be useful
in debugging this?  I'm including below a commented typescript of
xwininfo and xprop for a typical window sequence.  I can reproduce
this problem at will, so I can look at anything needed.

There is an explicit example in the tcsh man page. People interested
can search for the string "cwdcmd".

Under ksh I set an env var to lock my console xterm and stop its title getting
changed to the current path - here's some snippets:

I have a script called console with the following line in it:

  LOCK_TITLE=1 xterm -C -bg SteelBlue -n Console -T Console

In the line above, the xterm gets spawned with LOCK_TITLE set to 1.  The value
of this var is then checked in the function that sets the xterm title - if
LOCK_TITLE is set, the xterm title doesn't get updated when a dir change
occurs.

Elsewhere is the ksh function:

  function term_title
  {
    if (( ${LOCK_TITLE:=0} == 0 )); then
      label_window $*
      label_icon $*
    fi
  }

Everytime pwd changes, some higher function gets invoked to mash the hostname
and path, and then term_title is called to set the title/icon.

Hopes this help.

Cheers,

Ron

I have an xbiff swallowed by my FvwmButtons bar.  Under 1.24, it
worked fine -- it would turn black when I got mail, turn back when I
read it.  Under 2.0.43, it never changes.  It beeps when I get mail,
but the image never changes.  Any ideas?

Hi,

[ I am new to this list, so please bear with me if this is a FAQ; and
  please *do* tell me. I read all the doc's that I could find, but I
  might easily have missed something. ]

I provide the Fvwm window manager for a few users at my university
account and I just upgraded from Fvwm 2.0.34 to Fvwm 2.0.42 on
Solaris. While doing so, I noticed a few problems:

 - Fvwm fails to open windows, that contain OpenGL widgets. This
   occurs both with Fvwm 2.0.34 and Fvwm 2.0.42. There is no such
   problem with ol(v)wm, twm, or mwm. When trying to start the
   application, the window size will be *far* too big and the
   application appears to hang.
   I am sorry that I cannot be more specific, as the applications all
   use a proprietary library that I am not allowed to make publically
   available. I will try to find more information or to alternatively
   make a statically linked sample application available. Please tell
   me, what would be most helpful. This is a really serious bug, that
   prevents a few people from using Fvwm.

 - The 2.0.42 release seems to lack some of the modules that came with
   older releases. I have not yet check, if these features are now
   available by other means, but a short note in the documentation
   might be helpful. Besides, it appears that the old modules still
   work, so why did you have to remove the source code anyways?

 - FvwmButton seems to have a bug when swallowing the FvwmPager
   module. When I tried to do this, the space for the pager was
   allocated (4 buttons), but the pager did not show up in it. I did
   not investigate this any further, as using the old version of
   FvwmButton would fix this problem. I can provide more information,
   if this is needed.

 - I do not want to bind anything to the left mouse button, when on
   the desktop background. How do I disable the default exit-menu?


Comments are very much appreciated!


So long,


Markus

I just finished compiling and installing Fvwm:

Fvwm Version 2.0.39 compiled on Jun 14 1996 at 10:33:44


I'm having troubles getting xterms to come up -- everything else works 
fine (for instance, Netscape).  I keep getting this error:

xterm: Error 14, errno 22: Invalid argument

If I run xterms manually (ie. from a shell prompt) they run fine.

Here's my .fvwmrc line:

*FvwmButtons XTerm    xterm-sol.xpm    Exec "XTerm" xterm &

I've tried different variations on this, including with more arguments, 
with and without single quotes, with and without ampersands, fully 
pathed, no different.

I also tried a truss on it, nothing flash showed up.

Any ideas anyone?

Just did a truss on both the running fvwm process clicking on an xterm 
button, and trussing an xterm from a commandline.  Got this from the 
commandline truss:

19541:  getuid()                                        = 347 [347]
19541:  getgid()                                        = 20 [20]
19541:  sigaction(SIGTTOU, 0xEFFFEBD0, 0xEFFFECD0)      = 0
19541:  sigaction(SIGALRM, 0xEFFFEBD0, 0xEFFFECD0)      = 0
19541:  alarm(2)                                        = 0
19541:  open("/dev/tty", O_RDWR)                        = 6
19541:  alarm(0)                                        = 2
19541:  sigaction(SIGALRM, 0xEFFFEBD0, 0xEFFFECD0)      = 0
19541:  ioctl(6, TCGETS, 0xEFFFF63C)                    = 0
19541:  close(6)                                        = 0


And this from the fvwm process:

18678:  getuid()                                        = 347 [347]
18678:  getgid()                                        = 20 [20]
18678:  sigaction(SIGTTOU, 0xEFFFF0A0, 0xEFFFF1A0)      = 0
18678:  sigaction(SIGALRM, 0xEFFFF0A0, 0xEFFFF1A0)      = 0
18678:  alarm(2)                                        = 0
18678:  open("/dev/tty", O_RDWR)                        Err#22 EINVAL
18678:  alarm(0)                                        = 2
18678:  sigaction(SIGALRM, 0xEFFFF0A0, 0xEFFFF1A0)      = 0
18678:  write(2, " x t e r m", 5)                       = 5
18678:  write(2, " :   E r r o r  ", 8)                 = 8
18678:  write(2, " 1 4", 2)                             = 2
18678:  write(2, " ,   e r r n o  ", 8)                 = 8
18678:  write(2, " 2 2 :  ", 4)                         = 4
18678:  write(2, " I n v a l i d   a r g u".., 16)      = 16
18678:  write(2, "\n", 1)                               = 1
18678:  sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, 0xEFFFF0E8, 0xEFFFF0D8)  = 0


As it shows, the already-exec'ed xterm process is trying to get to 
/dev/tty, and failing with an EINVAL.  The weirdest thing is that 
according to the open(2) man page, EINVAL shouldn't even be a returned 
error value upon a call to open().

Does this give anyone a better idea?

This is not entirely helpful to your problem, but have you had a look
at Nethack/Qt as available from
"http://student.uq.edu.au/~s002434/nhqt/"? It looks a lot better than
standard Nethack/Xt.

Sorry to disappoint you, but you should go to the source
(ftp.hpc.uh.edu:/pub/fvwm/version-2) and get 2.0.42.  I can't say that it
will fix your problem, but FVWMButtons was completely rewritten since
2.0.39 and it really helps everyone if we're all at the same code base when
tracking down bugs.

	Dear fvwm users,

	I have installed fvwm-2.0.42 on solaris 2.4. Compilations 
and installation went smoothly.

	When I attempt to start fvwm2, it does not abort, appears
running, but nothing seen on the screen. To test the correctness of
the DISPLAY env. variable I start twm in similar circumstances, it
performs as expected.

	How can I test to see what is wrong with the fvwm2 installation?

	Your help is much appreciated...

I've followed this thread with interest and I've noticed that some
people use 'xterm -C' in order to create a console window.
Since this thread is unrelated to fvwm, as someone has already
observed, I would like to add my $0.02 here as well :-)

For those using SunOS or Solaris, I suggest that they check out a
neat little tool called 'contool' which is OpenLook-based tool, very
similar to the console window under Sun's OpenWindows.

It has the following neat features:
1. Scrollbars (OpenLook style)
2. Read-only - that is, you can't use it to type shell commands
3. Employs a sophisticated filtering mechanism, so that
   one can discard all non-interesting or trivial console messages.
4. When iconified, The icon flashes (!!) when a console message arrives
5. Adds date & time to every console message. As some of you have
   probably noticed, some system console messages arrive out of the 
   blue, w/o date & time, so if you're away for a while, you don't
   know when a problem has occured.

I can't recall where I picked it up, but the tar file that I have is
dated Mar 10, 1994 and it's version 3.3.

You can even configure it, to pop up once new messages arrive. This is
very useful if Fvwm is configured to show no icon for Contool. Thus,
Contool is totaly invisible as long as no message have shown up yet. I
have these lines in my .fvwmrc:

  Style "Contool" Sticky,WindowListSkip,ClickToFocus,NoIcon,StartIconic
  AddToFunc "InitFunction"    "I" Exec contool -geometry 525x180-0-0 &

guess so. you could only do an xterm -e tcsh -c script
and have a setenv in the script

or use -l (? - our manual pages on tcsh are not up-to-date).

I do sth similar:
I have a CONSOLE ( -C  switch) xterm whih is 70x4 and swallowed into my
buttonbar which in term is sticky. (So I can always start any program and
see any Console Messages. Also, since it's the first xterm which is
started, all write & talk messages go there.)

My prompt normally looks like "time hostname:path>" But since that xterm is
rather small and I know which machine I'm on (physically), I set my prompt
just to time path> in my .login. Since the console is the only xterm which
is started with -ls, and .login is executed after .cshrc, the former
overwrites the latter.


so in short: I do my usual setup in .cshrc, my console is 

*FvwmButtons(10x2, Swallow (UseOld, NoClose, Respawn) "Console" \

I've been using 2.0.41 for a while, no problems.

Have just compiled and installed 2.0.42 under Linux 3.12, gcc 2.7
and find that nothing is displayed except the fvwm pager and menus
if I click on the root window.

After some experimenting I found that starting fvwm as "fvwm2 -d myhost"
made everything work and yet all the tests I did indicated that 
$DISPLAY was set correctly. 

Have I missed something?

TIA

Hello,

I'm relatively new to the list & have been lurking about for a while.
But, it just so happens I've been icon-hunting myself.

I've been ripping off icons left and right. :-)  Before trying fvwm
2.0.42, I tried fvwm95, but decided it was too little of a change to
bother right now.  But, I like their mini-icons for menus.

It can be found at: ftp://mitac11.uia.ac.be/pub/fvwm95-2.0.41f.tgz
or on the web site at: http://ltiwww.epfl.ch/~barth/fvwm95.html

I've also played around with AfterStep, and I'm using quite a few icons
snagged from there.  The web page is located at:

  http://woodward-52.rh.uchicago.edu/~frank/afterstep/

Although, I haven't been able to get through lately.  I seem to recall
there's a few icons available through the web page and a link to more
photo-like icons.

I've also done some icon-hunting through the Yahoo icon page.  Although
most of the emphasis is on WWW-oriented stuff, there's some interesting
things to be found if you're persistent:

  http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/
  Programming/Icons/

One day I'd like to compile all of my favorites with proper credits and
offer them for distribution.  If/when I do that, I'll post here.

Do you have a ".fvwm2rc" in your home dir? Copy the sample file that
comes with the sources and put it or in your home dir or in the
system-wide Fvwm libdir (chosen in compilation time).

Hi,

I do not like my mouse pointer to be warped. Fvwm usually does not do
this, unless I tell it to do so explicitly, but there is one case,
when this annoying behavior still shows up. Judging from the context,
I actually believe this to be a bug, as it handles "ClickToFocus"
different from "SloppyFocus" which does not make much sense in this
context. Could you please consider incorporating this (or a similar)
patch in one of the next beta releases? Is posting to the mailing
list, the appropriate way of submitting patches?

OK, no problem. In first message to this list I reported exactly the
same problem. :-)

Actually, the Focus Warp behavior has already been changed in the next

Sure.

If your DISPLAY variable is set correctly, the -d shouldn't be needed.
Something else odd must be happening for you.

If fvwm & the pager started, they at least have the correct display
value.  You aren't trying to set that in any of your shell startup
files, are you?  It could be being set incorrectly for any programs
being Exec'ed if so.

Hello,

in my .fvwm2rc I have the following two lines:

...Style "*" HandleWidth 3,Icon "default.xpm"
IconPath     /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps/

but when I iconify something no icon appears, as if noIcon was specified.

What am I doing wrong? The docu is very light on that subject....

I am using the latest fvwm...

ciao

Hi.

Is it possible to bind function to a keycode? This may sound strange,
but my Xserver (HP Xterminal) seems to have a hardcoded upper limit on
keycodes that it is possible to bind to a keysym. I've got my hands on
a MS Natural Keyboard and want to use the extra buttons (Windows, and
Print buttons) on it. When try to use xmodmap to bind the windows
button to something I get:

>xmodmap -e "keycode 148 = backslash"
xmodmap:  commandline:0:  bad keycode value (out of range)
xmodmap:  1 errors encountered, aborting.


Just curious if it is possible to do it, would love to bind some menus
to it.

Best regards,
Roy.

Hi there,

I added the following line to .fvwm2rc:

    Key w A 3 Next [grossjoh@charly] Function GoThere

I then wanted to get this without restarting Fvwm, so I started
FvwmTalk and entered the very same line.

Sadly, nothing happened -- the keybinding was not recognized.
Restarting Fvwm did the trick, so I know the line must have been OK.
I don't think that I mistyped the line -- I was really careful.

What's the story?

tia,
kai

Hi Guys,
	I am new to this list, however I have a question about fvwm2.
I don't seem to be able to have (2) two commands on the same line in
a menu. In the old fvwm I was able to do this:

+	"Pine" 	Exec /usr/bin/popclient -3 -u XXXXX -p XXXXXXX bigdog\ 
-o /var/spool/mail/ray;xterm -fg black -bg white -fn 10x20\ 
-geometry 82x27+16+32 -ls -e pine &

Note the semi-colon where I seperate the (2) commands.
This is all one line, but doesn't work. I hope this isn't a dumb
question asked all the time, but I can't seem to find anything
on it. 

Any info or pointers appreciated and thanks for your patience,

2 commands to an Exec stopped working in 2.0.42.  The workaround
is to enclose the command in a '/bin/sh -c <cmd>' like this:

+	"Pine" 	Exec /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/popclient -3 -u XXXXX -p XXXXXXX \
 bigdog\
-o /var/spool/mail/ray;xterm -fg black -bg white -fn 10x20\ 
-geometry 82x27+16+32 -ls -e pine'

Whether this will change in 2.0.43 is not clear to me.

i am not sure if this is a window manager question or
not, but i wish to use the arrow keys on my numeric
keypad, as well as the enter key next to it.  however,
X always ignores my num lock setting and seems to assume
that it is always on.  is it possible to use those keys
in this fashion?  or is this a hack that still needs to
be performed?

p.s. i'd also love to see a scroll lock mode for emacs
if anyone has heard of one.

   to control that...

YES!  Please do.  This is the biggest gripe I've had with fvwm 2 vs
version 1.  When you have overlapping windows and want to type (or paste) 
into a lower one, clicking on it raises it, obscuring what you want to
see (or cut).

Hello all,

I am experiencing a weird problem with FvwmButtons/fvwm-2.0.42 and xlock under
Solaris 2.5.  If I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file:

*FvwmButtons Lock       xlock.xpm       Exec /usr/openwin/bin/xlock -mode random

xlock does not execute and emits the following error message:

xlock: can't get the user password. Exiting ...
        You need to run xlock in setuid root mode on your local machine.
        Contact your system administrator.

But, if I run the command

/usr/openwin/bin/xlock -mode random

from the shell prompt it works just fine.  And xlock is already suid root:

daneel:15> ls -gl /usr/openwin/bin/xlock
-rwsrwxr-x   1 root     bin         94484 Oct  2  1995 /usr/openwin/bin/xlock*

and /usr/openwin/bin is on the local disk, so NFS is not stripping the suid
bits for me:

daneel:16> df -k /usr/openwin/bin
Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s6     242431  195109   44898    82%    /usr


Has anyone else seen this problem?  Does anyone have a solution to it?  Any
help or hints would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dan Ehrlich

Software Configuration:

Everything was compiled with SunPRO C 4.1.

Does anyone know of a way I can change an icon on the fly?  Specifically,
I've got a shell script that does certain things depending upon how many
new mail messages I have, and I'd like to change the icon on the xterm
which my mail program is running under so the cute little flag on the
mailbox flips up when there is new mail.  It just looks wrong otherwise. 
:-)

I'm currently using fvwm-2.0.40 on Solaris 2.5. 

Thanks.

Can anyone help? I've taken a stock fvwm (2.0.42) and typed the
instructions as required. Unfortunately, when it starts to build the
libs it can not find the include files. When the gcc line is
developed, there are no -I options there. Since I am not a make or Imake
expert, can anyone help me trouble shoot this problem.

Thanks in advance.

I think you are looking for xmailbox. xmailbox's icon will change when
new mail comes (can even do some animation and sound) and it will open
an user-defined mail program when you click on it.

Hope this helps.

I have a theory.
Suppose the author of xlock was an idiot and used getlogin() to find the
user's login name - fvwm will not have a controlling terminal or utmp entry
and getlogin() will fail.

Try this test:
	rsh yourhost /usr/openwin/bin/xlock -mode random
If it fails the same way it's almost certainly a controlling tty problem.

Best solution (assuming I'm right - I may not be):
	- Fix xlock to use getuid(), not getlogin().

Workaround:
	- Get your shell startup (.env for ksh, cshrc for csh, etc)
	  or your first xterm to write the tty name (if any) to a well known
	  file.load the name when you invoke xlock and attach
		#!/bin/sh
		# attach to a useful tty
		tty=`cat well-known-file`
		if [ ! -c "$tty" ]
		then  echo "$0: $tty: not a tty" >&2; exit 1
		fi
		exec "$@" <"$tty" >"$tty" 2>&1
	  and say
		Exec the-wrapper-above /usr/openwin/bin/xlock -mode rand

Sorry folks, but I have an icon for xlock (v3.8) in my FvwmButtons
that works nicely (HP-UX 9.07, X11R6.1, fvwm-2.0.42, gcc-2.7.2).

I just did a search on my xlock source code and I didn't find a call to
getlogin() (although there was an extern for it which may mean it was
used at one time).  There were bunches of calls to getuid().

Maybe it's the way you define it.  Try adding an "exec" before xlock.  My
xlock works fine, under an AddToMenu command: 

+       "XLock%mini.xlock.xpm%"         Exec  exec xlock -mode random &

I didn't experiment much with it, and don't know if you need the "&" on
the end, for example, but this works for me.  BTW, my xlock is the same
path and permissions and so on. 

Cheers.

Mmm, well.... I've used it before and it's not really what I'm looking
for.  Basically I want to know if it's possible to use an xpm file as the
icon image for a window (xterm) and then switch it to another xpm file
without restarting fvwm (or the xterm).

The new FvwmConsole module looked very promising, but when I tried to
use it, it failed to start. Subsequent debugging revealed several
fatal bugs. I attached diffs that fix all of the bugs that I could
find. I did not bother about fixing compiler warning messages, though.

I found this, I think, right after Rob decided to stop maintaining
FVWM.  The FvwmWinList creeps across the screen as you add and
remove entries to it.  (Try opening 15 copies of "xlogo" with it
if you don't understand what I mean).

The fix is simple.  Here's the diff against a 1.24r version of FVWM.
Since the problem is still in FVWM2, I assume the code for this
module hasn't changed much.


janus:1 zephyr ~/fvwm-1.24r/modules/FvwmWinList% diff FvwmWinList.c.old FvwmWinList.c
543c543
<       XMoveResizeWindow(dpy,win,win_x+win_border,win_y+win_title+win_border,
---
>       XMoveResizeWindow(dpy,win,win_x+win_border-1,win_y+win_title+win_border-1,


And that's all there is to it.  You could probably even pipe this in to
patch on whatever modified version of FvwmWinList you have and it would
figure out how to fix it.

I like to turn off icons altogether and keep the WinList open all the
time, so you can see how this creeping might get a tad annoying :-)
While I've got everyone's attention, I wonder if the hard-coded feature
of typing "q" in the window to make it exit could be turned into a
configurable option.

In any case, thanks for continuing to update the package.  FVWM is a
Very Good Thing.

yes it is.

I think you can only use predefined keysyms, so search for an unused one
(sorry I don't knoe the file to look for, since I only remember having
heard this on this list around December/Januar/February)
have a look in the archive (pointer is on Fvwm Homepage)

	I was compiling 1.24r and after unloading and untaring
everything I tried xmkmf. And it was good. I then tried make
Makefiles, and it could not find xpmroot.

	I went off, read everything I could find, and finally
downloaded a separate version of fvwm-modules.tar.gz That did have
xpmroot.  Back to the xmkmf and make Makefiles...

... 
making Makefiles in xpmroot...
        mv Makefile Makefile.bak
./Imakefile: 7: Can't find include file ../Fvwm.tmpl

Could some kind soul point me to Fvwm.tmpl?

Hi there,

I wish the old twm way of mouse button 3 doing interesting things when
actively placing a window would be back.  I know that I can use button
2 to do that, but it's just not the same.

:-)

In case you're wondering what I'm talking about:  turn on
ActivePlacement, open a new window.  You get to drag the outline, then
  - mouse 1 places the window there immediately
  - mouse 2 lets you resize the window first and places it when you
    release the button
Other twm derivatives have
  - mouse 3 does a vertical zoom (actually, a bottom zoom, similar to
    dragging the bottom edge right to the bottom of the screen)

tia,
kai

Hi,

I'm currently using Fvwm Version 2.0 pl 25 under HP-UX.

I use xterms/zsh for most of my work.  My question is how do I set the
*ACTIVE* border/window text color for my xterms.  The Color option for
Style will set the *INACTIVE* colors for me.

I've tried setting XTerm and mwm_bw resources in my .Xdefaults
e.g.

mwm_bw*activeForeground:        white
mwm_bw*activeBackground:        red

suggestions?

(I'm currently getting gray borders with black text for the active
window)

Sometimes one of my windows just doesn't seem to be visible anymore.
This usually happens after I've dragged a window across pages using the
little pager module.

It still shows on my winlist, but I select it off the win list and my
mouse just warps to the top of the page where there's nothing.

What's the easiest way to get it back?  I've had to just kill the
application and it's a pain because it takes a long time to load,
again.

I've had this happen before.  After your mouse warps to the top of the
screen, hit alt-F5, or whatever keystroke is bound to "Move".  The window
will now be in 'move' mode, and you can drag it back down from never-never
land with the mouse.

Hope this helps :)

Software really shouldn't change names as versions change.

I had the same problem, too. Apparently something in the FvwmButtons
code changed and now you have to write the parameters in a different
way. This is what I used:

    *FvwmButtons (2x2 Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

In your case, that would probably read:

    *Wharf (Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

I hope this helps,

How about installing it as /usr/lib/X11/fvwm-2.0.42 and then
establishing a (symbolic) link from /usr/lib/X11/fvwm (or from
/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 if you will)?

This is the way that I installed it. It has the benefit of easy
migration from one version to another without causing too much
confusion among the users. Whenever you intend to upgrade, you first
install the new binary without changing the link, but you make sure
that everybody knows about the change and should start testing,
whether his configuration files still work with the new release. After
a while, you change the link to the new release. Now, your users are
really supposed to use the new release, but if they have problems,
they can still get their work done by temporarily using the old
release. Finally after yet another grace period, you remove the old
release.

Is it possible to create a button on the fvwm button module that
swallows a process, but also, when clicked on, executes a command?  i.e.
maybe an xbiff button that will execute a mail reader when clicked on,
or an xload button that will execute a top window when clicked on.  If
this is not possible, maybe that would be a neat feature to implement.
      
Thanks

1) I know this is too late for the official release but I've just finished
   moving over from CTWM to fvwm and the one thing I am missing is the
   f.movepack instruction.  What this does is a move but the other windows
   on the screen are treated like the screen edge so moving over them has
   some resistance.  It makes it very easy to tidy up the display.

   It could be implemented as a separate function or as part of Move if you
   specify a non-zero BorderResistance value (c.f. EdgeResistance).
   There wasn't an f.resizepack in CTWM but it would have been useful.

   Any thoughts on the feasibility of this?

2) I would quite like a MoveRelative command so I could jump windows around
   the screen in steps.  How easy would this be?
   
Cheers,
Tim.

Try invoking Move with the keyboard, then play with the Cursor keys.
Was this what you had in mind?

I think this is a good rule in general, but fvwm2 will not work if run
with a .fvwmrc config file created for fvwm.  I think that is adequate
reason to change the binaries name.

At least it is reason enough to change the name of the configuration file.

Personally, I don't much care, either way, since I've already done the
conversion, but as a PR move, I think naming the binary fvwm2 and
the config file .fvwm2rc, at least by default, is the way to go so that
we can make it easier for large sites to convert gradually to fvwm2,
without having to hack things during installation -- indeed, this is what
the current situation is, unless I'm mistaken, and what it should be,
so I guess writing an overlong sentence about it really overkill, but
it does remind me about the documentation, which I haven't read in detail
for quite a while, er, where was I, oh yes, what is the status of said
documentation and has anyone read it from beginning to end to see if it
is unnecessarily redundant or has missing pieces or other troubles, although
I seem to remember Chuck saying something about doing things in that
general direction.

My English teacher would have killed me.

I've recently compiled fvwm2 and really like the package.  I'm getting
ready to roll this out to the user community and ran into a problem
getting the system-wide defaults to be picked up.
In the man page it states,
"First,  fvwm  will search for a file named .fvwm2rc (or .fvwmrc based
on how it was compiled - .fvwm2rc  is  the default) in the users home
directory.  Failing that, it will look for   /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/.fvwm2rc
for system-wide defaults.  If that file is not found, fvwm will be
basically useless."
So I copied a generic .fvwm2rc file to /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/.fvwm2rc.  I
moved my working .fvwm2rc out of the way and then reinitiated fvwm2.
The restart did not pick up the system-wide defaults as stated.  Is
there some work around for this.  It's really important that there be
a system default file, but as it stands right now it doesn't seem to
work.

This seems to be the question of the day.

My advice is to create  a shell called "fvwm2".   Put the shell in the
users PATH, not the fvwm2 binary.  If the  user has no $HOME/.fvwm2rc,
create one using your generic file.

That's a useful workaround, but the documented behavior is much better
and should be fixed... anyone have ideas why it doesn't?

My 'fvwm' reads '.fvwmrc' files formatted for 2.x ...  That was why
I made the original comment.

I wondered if anyone else had seen the problems that the two modules FvwmForm
and FvwmScroll have in 16 bpp mode.

What I see is FvwmScroll coming up with just *black* decor. Very gothic,
but not terribly practical, and FvwmForm has just glorious black and white,
not even grey-scale.

What on earth is going on here? Is there some fundamental flaw in X that
applications can fail to use available colors? Or what?

I am using fvwm2 and have been using Fvwm-Audio to play sound
files for some things in the past. I recently installed
'rsynth' on my system and would like to make Fvwm-Audio play
messages using 'say' from the 'rsynth' package. Has anyone
tried this, or know if this is possible ? This would be real
neat to be able to play any message you wanted. Rsynth seems
to work pretty well using the British dictionary.

Any info or pointers appreciated, thanks,

That sounds possible.  Do you want it to say things like "open",
"close", etc?

Try something like this:

*FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/local/bin/say
*FvwmAudio deiconify open
*FvwmAudio iconify close
*FvwmAudio raise_window raise
*FvwmAudio lower_window lower

This will invoke say as `say open', `say close', `say raise', and 
`say lower'.

fvwm2 could perhaps be able to recognize old fvwm 1.xx keywords and
output an error message telling explicitely that the .fvwmrc is not in
the right format. How difficult would that be (and how much bloat
would that add to the code) ?

Yes, I've seen this, and so have others. In fact, there was some talk
about this problem on this list not so long ago, but IIRC there
weren't any comments from the authors/maintainers of the
modules. Hopefully it will be fixed before the release of 2.1.

if you need quotes on the xterm command line, you'll need a second pair of
quotes for fvwm2 to use it as a single "filename" :-)
like:
*FvwmAudio iconify '"Mission accomplished"'

sorry, can't test it, no "say" command :-(

sorry, forget my previous post, sugesting quote-layers:
I tried

*FvwmAudioPlayCmd playaudio
*FvwmAudio deiconify open
*FvwmAudio iconify close
*FvwmAudio raise_window '\"Mission accomplished\"'

with playaudio being:

#!/usr/local/lbin/tcsh
echo ${argv[1-]} > /dev/console

;-)

how is an underline pronounced by "say" ?

id est: can you say Mission_accomplished ?


BTW: I think it's a bug. A quoted parameter to FvwmAudion should be treated
as ONE parameter.
Maybe someone has a "These were the times.au" file?
It's possible in unix, so it should be possible to play it.

cheers,

To use rsynth, you use the command 'say'. From a xterm if you
use "say Mission accomplished", it will pronounce it correctly
with no quotes at all. If I try say _ it will pronunce the
word "underscore".
It works pretty well, except I can't get it to work with fvwm2.
Any other ideas ?
This is a sample of my fvwm audio, do you see anything wrong here ?
It will pronounce all these words in a xterm shell.

# FvwmAudio
#
*FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/bin/say 
*FvwmAudio startup '"Welcome to Ray's Linux Machine !"' 
*FvwmAudio shutdown '"I am shutting down now !"' 
*FvwmAudio unknown '"goofed up"'
*FvwmAudio destroy_window '"destroy window'"
*FvwmAudio iconify '"lower window"'
*FvwmAudio deiconify '"open window"'
*FvwmAudio add_window '"Add new window now !"'
*FvwmAudio toggle_paging '"toggle paging"'
*FvwmAudioDelay 3
*FvwmAudio focus_change '"focus window"'
*FvwmAudio raise_window '"Raise window"'
*FvwmAudio lower_window '"Lower window"'

Did you try removing the quotes completely? I remember I had a similar
problem getting fvwm to spawn an xterm running lynx with a specific URL.
I was trying

Exec xterm -e "lynx http://www.blah" &

which failed miserably, but when I tried

Exec xterm -e lynx http://www.blah &

it worked fine.

Yours etc,

I tried it without quotes, but it doesn't work.
For me it looks, like FvwmAudio only uses the first word as a
parameter.

try the followin Patch
FvwmAudio: Line 302

	      else  {
		message = strtok(NULL, " \t");
-		sound = strtok(NULL, " \t");
+		sound = strtok(NULL, "\n");
	    
		if (!message || !*message || !sound || !*sound)

this worked for me.

Maybe there's a doc error ?
Doesn't fvwm2 search in the directory /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2 ?

Forgive a newbie question, but I've been through the man pages
several times and I can't get the behavior I want. I'm using the
2.0.42 package.

I can't figure out the appropriate settings for FvwmIconBox so that my
iconized functions are click-able from that module. To describe in
more detail, so you can know if what a want is appropriate with that
tool: When I iconize a frame, I want it to appear in the Iconbox. I'd
like to click on it in the IconBox to to de-iconify. My config file is
called .fvwm2rc.

would someone mind sending me some sample settings so I can play with
them?

Thanks in advance:

Good morning.
I'm preparing a machine runnning over X11 with fvwm window manager, and 
I have some problems:
My computer will run a demo an during it's ejecution I need to have the 
keyboard and the mouse disabled. One solution I thought about is:
When the computer comes into Demo-Mode, just change the system.fvwmrc 
with another one which I has previously prepared to disable all 
keyStrokes and all mouse events. But the problem is that I have to 
restart fvwm and I don't know how to do this.

Could anybody tell me how can I do?
I will thaks you if you tell me that there is a better way to solve my 
problem with the Demo-Mode.

Thanks.

	This won't help with the icon box, but might be a better solution 
to what your looking for: FVWMIconMan. It is a TWM-like icon manager 
module that hangs out in your screen. You can click on it to (de)iconify
a window and setup some other neat programmable functions. (One of mine 
is to click w/ mouse 2 on the icon manager and have the focus warped to 
the window selected. 3 functions can be bound, 1 to each mouse key, one 
of which is usuallly (de)iconify). If you havn't seen/heard of the icon 
manager, I'd say try it out....It is very flexible and sounds like it 
might be best suited for what you want to do. (I also think it looks 
better than the icon box or the screen icons)

Brady Montz, the author, puts it on-line at ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub.

For the most part, I've got This program working the way I want
them. However, certain icons are showing up as empty boxes. I'm trying
to use the override in the .fvwm2rc file as such:

*FvwmIconBox Emacs emacs.icon

where emacs.icon is on the IconPath and the Pixmap path.

Its compiled with the -DSHAPE option and not the -DXPM option.

How can I debug this?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: FVWM: download fvwm to X terminal?
Organization: CIRES, University of Colorado
X-Attribution: mb
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

Hi --

Is anyone here familiar with HP Aptrex X terminals?

Because of local network bandwidth problems, the fvwm users here are
in the position of slowly being pushed toward a window manager that is
downloadable to the X terminal itself. Currently that means mwm or
cde. We run fvwm on a host, so all the WM X traffic goes through the
network.

But those of us who have used fvwm until now like it and would like to
continue to do so as long as the performance penalty is not too great
(it's marginal now).

So, does anyone now if the download protocal/mechanism to X terminals
is generic enough to accept third party window managers? Or is this
something proprietary such that HP would have to effectively rubber
stamp any window managers that are downloaded?

Thanks for any tips or advice.

Check if "man XGrabKeyboard" and "man XGrabPointer" provides the
information, you need...

If anyone else is still curious, I received this reply from one of the
HP newsgroups.

I guess without inside connections/access to HP internal libs, it's
not possible.

Sorry but you can't download 3rd party window managers to run locally
inside the X Terminal.  The primary reason is that the code must be
compiled for the intel 960 and even then, you'd need access to HP's
internal libX11,libC libraries.

The Aptrex terminals will load Enware software and you can have the
following local window managers: dtwm,mwm,vuerx,vuewm,olwm, and twm.
(Twm is provided but not supported).

Cheers,
Chris.

Too bad.  HDS has a development kit for their terminals, and provide fvwm
in the base package.  I don't know what version it is.  BTW, I wonder if
this violates the fvwm license.

The problem is that xmodmap won't accept any keycodes above 141. The
Windows buttons are 148, 149 and 150. Is it possible to work around this?
Can one change a keycode?

I do not know your X terminal, but I believe that many X terminals use
BOOTP/TFTP for downloading their software (and for determining their
IP address, the server name and a few other things). Possible
alternatives are combinations of ARP, DHCP, FTP and NFS, but those
protocols are less likely. So, as a general rule I believe that the
download protocol is very likely to agree with some RFC. Close
inspection of your installed software will probably reveal which
protocol is being used.

Unfortunately, this does not buy you much. You still need to figure
out how to build binaries that are executable on your X terminal. For
this, you are probably dependant on information from the manufacturer.

What is the best way to restart fvwm2 with a different config file? 

I am trying to swicth menus without manually changing the link
.fvwm2rc points to. So I nead to restart fvwm2 and read an alternate
file instead of .fvwm2rc... but 'Restart fvwm2' is the only way to
restart it, right? no '-f file' there... so I thought about using the
Read function... without restarting fvwm2. the problem is that
AddtoMenu keeps adding to the menus already defined... can i
reinitialize the menus somehow? If anyone has some hints about this,
please let me know, thanks.

This is very strange.

I have define XPM on.
I have define IconPath on, PixmapPath too.
I checked access bits (rwx)
The files compile


I did make Makefiles, so the correct defines are be compiled.  I saw
them do so.??

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

One thing doesn't seem to be clear from the docs/modules.tex file about
the new Send_ConfigInfo command: it doesn't indicate whether or not the
lines sent from fvwm are each supposed to end with a newline. 

I'm guessing that they are, based on the fact that using the line

    *FvwmButtons Restart eye2.xpm     Restart fvwm2

elicits this error message from fvwm, which is apparently trying to exec
"fvwm2\n" instead of "fvwm2":

    [FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2
    ' failed!!!!

...so either FvwmButtons should be stripping the newline, or fvwm
shouldn't be sending it.  (Right?)

Also: there are a few features I'd like to see in fvwm2 that aren't on
the TO-DO list as of PL42, in case anyone's interested...

- - there doesn't appear to be any way to move the pointer to an absolute
  position (e.g. centre of current viewport); CursorMove is relative to
  the current pointer position, and Focus is relative to some window...

- - Any plans for support routines for modules to be written in Tcl/Tk?

- - There should probably be a builtin configuration command to correspond
  to the (currently undocumented in the man page) '-blackout' option.
  It might not be useful during startup, but changing it for recaptures
  might be useful.  Likewise, it might be helpful to turn -debug on and
  off....

- - Using '#' as a comment character makes FvwmCpp rather difficult to
  use; one has to insert a space before each '#', and some cpp's will
  *still* complain in certain cases.  Could a secondary comment
  character be added, perhaps?  (Maybe '/', so that comment lines can be
  surrounded with /* ... */ -- which will also stop cpp from complaining
  about unterminated character constants whenever your comment contains
  an apostrophe....)

Cheers,

There's a command DestroyMenu (or something) that deletes a menu.  You
can then execute AddToMenu statements to create the new menu.

fvwm2 -cmd 'Read foo' should do something useful with respect to the
restarting thing.

Howdy all.

Just a quick note to let you all know that fvwm beta 2.0.43 is just
about ready, but needs some more small cleanup, and since I'm going on
vacation in a few moments, it'll have to wait until I get back next
week.  I tried to get it all done before I left, but fell just a
little short.

I hope to get it out there to you folks shortly after I return, like
Monday, July 8th if things go well when I return, which they should.

Thank you for your patience and support.

Later,
Chuck
