If you renamed your preprocessed add_window.i to junk.c, then did cc -c
junk.c, you would see that it compiled just fine.

Here's the problem.  Those token-paste operators ("##") are wrong.  ANSI
C requires that in  a ## b, all three of "a", "b", and the resulting
pasted token, be valid preprocessor tokens.  "->TitleHeight" is not a
valid token (it's *two* valid tokens).  Token pasting is not wanted
here.  The macros should read:

  #ifdef USEDECOR     /* THIS IS WHAT i WANT TO USE */
  #define GetDecor(window,part) ((window)->fl->part)
  #else
  #define GetDecor(window,part) (Scr.DefaultDecor.part)
  #endif

The AT&T/USL/SCO compiler differs from gcc in this matter.  It is not
wrong.  gcc is interpreting the ANSI standard more loosely than SCO cc.

PS: it would have been easier to figure out if you had included the
    actual error message!  I got:

      "junk.c", line 6: error: invalid token: ->TitleHeight

Thank You, David:
my problem was just the one You pointed out: I did not figured out that
I needed an rplay daemon ... now everything works just quite fine, but I
still got a couple of problems ;-).
	Where can I find a collection of good short sounds to attach to fvwm
events ? And, more important: where can I find the full list of fvwm
events ?
	I could neither understand if I can use this (rplay) good package as a
mime audio-type application: if yes, how ? if not, what can I use ? (We
are speaking about Linux and Netscape, of course ...). Thanks to You an
to everybody who will like to answer me (if any) in advance, and sorry
for the silly questions ...

I can't let pass the comment that tkgoodstuff is less flexible than
FvwmButtons!  It's easy to bind any X event on a tkgoodstuff button.  Just
write a simple client script.  Start with the file Example.tcl in the
tkgoodstuff distribution.  To find out how to specify X events (like <Double-3>
or <Enter> ), look at the man page for the "bind" Tcl command.  True, you
can't take advantage of this flexibility through the GUI preferences manager,
but surely at some point the right way to offer power and flexibility is 
through a scripting language, rather than a GUI tool or limited and obscure 
rc-file syntax (remember, you're comparing it to FvwmButtons).

For those who want anything more sophisticated than dumb unix command buttons, 
tkgoodstuff's client interface allows you to write simple Tcl/Tk scripts to
affect the button's display, behavior, etc., in any way you like.

For the non-power-user, there are the regular user-defined buttons (which are
more flexible that FvwmButtons in several respects, e.g., in automatically
becoming sunken when a window with a specified name is open), and there are
highly functional built-in clients: window list (icon manager), analog/digital
alarm clock, multi-folder Biff, multi-file file watcher, dialup networking
toggler/dialer, load monitor, GUI-configurable menu, etc., etc. A tkgoodstuff
panel can auto-minimize, can be dragged from sreen-edge to screen-edge, etc.
All this is configured with an on-line preferences manager, requiring no
memorization of funky syntax from man pages.

Tkgoodstuff is in beta for tcl/tk8.0 (which itself is still in alpha).
But it (like tcl/tk) is in pretty stable shape.

The tkgoodstuff homepage is: 

   http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff 

I very much welcome collaborators on this project.  Tcl/Tk is very easy to 
learn, and new functionality is typically easy to develop.  So if you find
something missing, let's talk about adding it.

Mark

>  Where can I find a collection of good short sounds to attach to fvwm
>  events ?

I believe there are some on the fvwm home site; I remember having
read that at some point. If you use tkdesk, there's quite a few
that come with that as well, and some packages a bundled with
sound files. Other than that, there's always the web - one of the
search engines will turn up something.

I found that some of the sounds that come with various packages aren't
all that suitable for a desktop. I eventually used mxv to edit the
sounds to taste, reducing volume where necessary, chopping out rough
bits and crackles, reducing their length and so on. I'm sure you can
spend years doing this sort of thing, but there comes a point where
you have to say 'good enough'. :-)


>  And, more important: where can I find the full list of fvwm
>  events ?

I had problems with this too, so I did what comes naturally and
consulted the source. :-) The FvwmAudio manpage isn't all that
helpful. In addition, there seem to be some mysteries involved
as well; it appears that there are hooks to make sounds on very
specific events, like icons by name, windows and resources by
name or class, mini_icons. use of the default icon, and some
(apparently debugging) events to do with configuration (FvwmConfig?).
I have no idea how all of that works, and even the source doesn't
appear to be that helpful to teh casual browser. Perhaps most of
this is intended to be handled outside of fvwm itself, and won't
help if you're running with the builtin-rplay as I am. If someone
can shed some light on these things, I'm certainly interested.

Anyway, here's how I configure FvwmAudio, and I find it works
quite well. The sounds do add something to the look and feel of
the desktop.

Yes, it can be done. Make sure you have write access to the
rplay server, and edit your mime.types configuration to run
rplay with the file on the command line for each of the audio
types it knows about.

I've got a visually impaired user that has a question. He's used a tool
called "puff" or "xpuff" in the past to magnify his view of the screen. The
tools sucks up a fair amount of CPU time & for other reasons, he'd like to
quit using it. What he wants is to fire up xterms with huge fonts (that span
muliple viewports) & have fvwm track his xterm text cursor & automatically
shift the viewport as necessary when he gets close to the edge of the screen. 
Is that possible? Are there any other better ideas?

thanks!

I've just moved to 2.0.45 and am taking the opportunity to rationalize my 
functions.  One of the changes was to make my window warping function generic:

	AddToFunc my_cursorwarp		"I" WarpToWindow 50p 50p

	AddToFunc my_warp		"I" Resize $1 $2
	+				"I" Move $3 $4
	+				"I" my_cursorwarp

	AddToFunc my_topleft		"I" my_warp 616p 400p 0p 0p

When I bind a key thus

	Key KP_7	A	N	my_topleft

It doesn't work, it starts an interactive resize.  When I recode my_topleft to:

	AddToFunc my_topleft	"I" Resize 616p 400p
	+			"I" Move 0p 0p
	+			"I" my_cursorwarp

It works! What's going on?

BTW This is unpatched 2.0.45 (so far;-) on HP-UX 10.20 with only the following 
change to Fvwm.tmpl necessary to get it to compile (all the goodies are in)
#define FvwmCompiler c89
#define FvwmCompilerFlags -D_INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE -D_INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE 
-D_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

I have downlaoded a version of fvwm and get the file fvwm-1.24r.tar.gz 
what do i do now.

I am able to remove the .gz by using gunzip but have no idea and have 
been unable to find out how the remove the .tar or what to do once I have 
done that.  

Also is there anywhere where i can get basic instructions on how fvwm 
works and how i implement it only my account or computer.

Delete it, and download fvwm-2.0.45.tar.gz?

Use tar.  A suitable command is "tar xf fvwm-1.24r.tar".

I don't think so.  You're just supposed to know.  To be fair to writers of 
books and FAQs, almost every X installation is different in signficant enough 
ways to make it difficult to give useful advice, other than "ask your local X 
guru".  What is your machine, anyway?  If you gave more information, people 
could help more.  For example, if you're accessing a VMS machine using VT200 
terminals, then you can't use fvwm; if you're using a Linux machine, then 
you've probably already got fvwm, and if we know whether you're using xdm or 
not, we can offer help on changing your window manager.

I currently have the following in the .fvwm2-menu.

# Main menu
AddToMenu "Main"	"Main menu"	  Title
+              		"&Xterm"	  Exec xterm -geometry 170x66+0+0 -bg black -fg lightblue -cr yellow -e /opt/computing/bin/tcsh &
+              		"&Applications..."Popup Apps
+              		""		  Nop
+                       "&Modules"	  Popup Module-Popup
+              		""		  Nop
+                       "Lock Screen"     Exec xlock -remote -mode flame
+                       ""                Nop
+                       "&Restart FVWM"   Restart
+                       ""                Nop
+              		"&Quit"           Quit

The problem I'm having (Or perhaps the request I'm making?) is for some
way of getting Fvwm2 to run a script before actually quitting. The
situation is that I want to update a couple of 'I'm here' status files
before leaving, pretty much like turning on your answering machine
before you go out I 'spose. What I'd ideally like is to be able to write
something like

+			"&Quit"		  Exec my_shell_script  then Quit

but I can't seem to see any way of doing it. Is it possible, and if not
how about sticking it in the next version, maybe with a syntax like

+			"&Quit"		  command1 ; command2 ; command3

Anyone?

Cheers,
Lee.

  Try defining a function named ExitFunction.

That was my first reaction too, but running Exec in the ExitFunction
may not work as expected since the Exec'd programs are effectively run
in the background so fvwm may quit before he wants it to.  One
possibility would have the last script run a given X application and
then in the ExitFunction he could Wait for that application's window
before finishing.  Another possibility is to bag ExitFunction (or, use
it for something else, and build and install FvwmCommand or FvwmPipe
(I prefer the former) from the extras directory.  Run the FvwmCommandS
program in Init and Restart functions, then, from the shell script
call "FvwmCommand quit" and let the shell script figure out when to
actually do the quitting.  FWIW, I use this feature to do lots of
funky stuff at startup.  For example, in a shell script that I run
from my initfunction I set a style for Netscape that starts it on Desk
5.  Then I do some funky stuff with xwininfo to detect that the
Netscape window has mapped, reset Netscape's style to start on Desk 3
and do a netscape -remote for the desired URL.  After detecting that
that window has mapped I reset the style to StartsAnyWhere.  In this
fashion I get complete control over fvwm from the shell.  On top of
that, I don't think it's possible to do it in .fvwm2rc because I can't
seem to set a style in a function.

Here is one untested way:

AddToFunc ImGone "I" Exec my_shell_script
+ "I" Quit

Then put this is the menu:

+ "&Quit" ImGone

If you have an .xsession file or .xinitrc file which runs fvwm2 for
you, just put your status update stuff AFTER the call to fvwm2 so that
they run when you quit fvwm2.

Why not execute a script from .xinitrc after fvwm?  Assuming you don't
need to actually be in fvwm to update status files.

I've been using this technique for some time:

_______________________________________________________________________=
________

AddToFunc Terminer
+ I Exec sh -c "rsh tag gnudoit \'\(hf-save-all-and-terminate\)\'; exec=
 xlogo"
+ I Wait xlogo
+ I Quit

AddToMenu Session=09Session=09=09Title
+=09=09=09&Quit=09=09Terminer

_______________________________________________________________________=
________

I.e. I exec "sh" with a single command line, the last command in which
is "xlogo". Any other X application should work, but something
lightweight seems the best choice here. It's not necessary to have the
final script run the X application itself, you can do that from the
.fvwmrc.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I recently started using fvwm2.  I'm very happy with it, although
I've lost about 1.5 days of work this week trying to configure it.

I am using a SPARCstation 5 running SunOS 4.1.4 and fvwm V2.0.41
(I think that's what's installed).  The one thing that I just can
not get to work is the Backspace key in Netscape.  It works in all
other windows (well, xterms and FrameMaker is all I really use).

I've just read the man page for VirtualBindings and have tried to
set resources for both Netscape and xmbind to no avail.  I'm sure
it's something simple, but I just can not figure it out.

Has anyone else run into this problem?  Any idea what I need to
do to fix this?

Alfred

I am using Redhat Linux 4.1 on an Intel Pentium.
I try to use fvwm2 as a windows manager. My system came preconfigured
with a line like 

exec fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 -debug .fvwm2rc.m4" -display :0 \
 		 >  $HOME/.FVWM2-errors 2 >&1

in my .xsession file. 

What does this M4 stuff do for me? Can I use "normal" .fvwm2rc files
(e.g. created by dotgenerator) and rename them to .fvwm2rc.m4 to get
some advantage of using m4. I'm sorry, but I'm totally confused??!:(

I found something in the archives but this wasn't very helpful, and yes
I checked the FvwmM4 man page!

I am happy about any answer! Thanks in advance.

The advantages of using m4 for your .fvwmrc are somewhat similar to
the advantages of using the C preprocessor for your .fvwmrc.  For
instance, using m4, the following lines give me either a mini-icon or a
full-size icon, all depending on whether _FvwmUseMiniIcons is 1 or not:

    # ...
    # Make this 0 for full-size icons.
    m4_define(`_FvwmUseMiniIcons_', `1')
    m4_ifelse(
    _FvwmUseMiniIcons_, `1', `
    m4_define(`_Icon',       `NoIcon,  MiniIcon mini/$1')
    ', `
    m4_define(`_Icon',       `Icon $1')
    ')
    # ...
    Style "control-panel"		_Icon(3d/preferences-choose.xpm)
    Style "Network Configurator"	_Icon(3d/networking-phone.xpm)
    Style "XJed*"			_Icon(3d/editor-app.xpm)
    Style "xterm"			_Icon(3d/shell.xpm)
    # ...

This sort of thing can be useful if you run multiple versions of fvwm,
some of which support certain features, and others of which don't; i've
got a set of config files that work cleanly with no modifications
whether i'm using fvwm-1.24r or fvwm-2.0.45.

FvwmM4 also defines variables that can be useful; for instance, the
following menu displays information about the currently running fvwm2
session (note that it uses tabs between labels (`Fvwm version') and
their values (`FVWM_VERSION) for better formatting):

    AddToMenu "AboutFvwm" "- About -" Title
    +	"Fvwm version	FVWM_VERSION"		Nop
    +	"Compiled with	OPTIONS"		Nop
    +	""					Nop
    +	"`X'VERSION Server by	VENDOR"		Nop
    +	"Running on	SERVERHOST"		Nop
    +	"Clients on	CLIENTHOST (OSTYPE)"	Nop
    +	"Display pixels	WIDTH x HEIGHT"		Nop
    +	"Visual	CLASS (PLANES`bpp')"		Nop
    +	"Pixels per meter X/Y	X_RESOLUTION/Y_RESOLUTION"	Nop

and this makes sure to look under my home directory for pixmaps:

    PixmapPath `'HOME`'/lib/X11/icons/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps

Look on your Red Hat Linux system in /etc/X11/TheNextLevel/ (use `ls
-a' to see all the files) for interesting uses of m4.

You can use regular .fvwmrc files with FvwmM4, but there are some
things to beware of if you do; for instance, m4 uses keywords such as
`define' and `include', and if you use them in your .fvwmrc 
without meaning m4 to interpret them, the results my not be what you
intend.  You can work around that somewhat by using the `-m4-prefix'
option with FvwmM4.  If you don't like the regular m4 quotes (<`> and
<'>), you can change them with `-m4-squote' and `-m4-equote' (m4 has
other ways to do so as well).

Note, though, that if you don't really want to use m4, you might want
to change your .Xclients script so it instead.

: I found something in the archives but this wasn't very helpful, and yes
: I checked the FvwmM4 man page!

m4 has an info page; you can read it using the `info' program:

    info

peace.

As promised, here is a patch to expand the M_MINI_ICON packet type to include
the normal window-identification triple, as well as tack the filename of the
icon itself at the end. Apply this patch from the *root* of your fvwm 2.0.45
source tree (my patch to the windowshade packets was relative to the fvwm
subdir; however, this patch also affects modules/FvwmIconMan) with:

patch -p -N < this_file

This patch does the following:

* Cause M_MINI_ICON packets to use their own send routines: SendMiniIcon and
  BroadcastMiniIcon

* Updates add_window.c to use these routines, as well as later in module.c

* Updates the struct used in modules/FvwmIconMan/fvwm.c to recognize the new
  format. The code itself needed no update, since it doesn't use any of the
  added fields

The new structure for packets of type M_MINI_ICON is:

word	meaning
0	0xffffffff
1	packet type (M_MINI_ICON)
2	length of packet
3	timestamp
4	X window ID
5	X ID of frame encompassing window
6	Fvwm internal database pointer
7	Width of mini-icon
8	Height of mini-icon
9	Depth (number of planes) of mini-icon
10	X Pixmap ID (not to confuse with XPM) of the mini-icon
11	X Pixmap ID of the mask
12+	Name cast into longs as per other textual packets, null-padded

I do not update the modules.tex file, because it doesn't yet mention these
packets, and it needs heavy revision anyway.

Release 0.4 of my Perl module X11::Fvwm will support this format, and will
also bundle this patch along with the code. Any code utilizing these packets
will need to be updated after this patch is applied.

Try the following.  It's better, in some sense, than using xmodmap to

Create a file called .motifbind in your home directory with the

I suspect the important one is the osfBackSpace entry.  This change
will apply to all Motif apps, but none of your other apps.

fvwm2.0.45 on SunOS 4.1.3 under X11R5

Netscape (and some other programs similarly), when iconified,
displays 'netscape' in its icon title bar.
When the mouse is on the icon (i.e., the icon has keyboard
focus), the icon title bar displays the document title.

I seem to be unable to find out how to make fvwm display
the latter (the document title) all the time, not only
when the icon has keyboard focus.

Can anybody tell me what the relevant title string
resources are and how to configure fvwm?

I figured out what my problem was.  I was working on a project
recently where I needed to use the latest imake.  So I put X11R6
in my path before /usr/bin/X11.  The next time I logged in, mwm
crashed (that should have been my first clue that something was
wrong).  But I am the only one around here that uses mwm on SunOS
(I can't stand OpenLook), so I didn't have anyone to turn to to
figure out what the problem was.  So I copied an R5 mwm into my
local bin directory, and everything worked fine.

But then I bit the bullet and spent a day and a half configuring
fvwm (I've been wanting to try fvwm for a while, but I knew that
it would take me some time to configure it the way I wanted to).
Anyway, to make a long story short, after talking to my system
administrator and telling what I did (putting X11R6 in my path
before X11R5), he "upgraded" my workstation to X11R6 and Motif
1.2.4 by running some scripts that copied some libraries to the
correct places.  Suddenly the backspace key started working again
(and I suspect the mwm works now too).

If I had asked to be upgraded to X11R6, mwm would have probably
not failed, and I'd still be using it.  I'm glad that I finally
took the time to configure fvwm.  Now I'm suddenly not in a big
hurry anymore to upgrade my workstation to Solaris and CDE :-).

Thanks to all of you who responded to my query.

Alfred

Hello,

Here is a repost of my MWM buttons patch, from late January.  My
normal site is temporarily down, so I'm just reposting it to the list
archive.  Hopefully this may make it into the next beta.  The default
behavior assignments are preserved; see the diff for the man page
update locations.

Summary: Basically, it lets you mark any window title buttons as
MWMMenu / MWMMaximize / MWMMinimize.

 - Normally, if an MWM decoration hint tells the window not to display a
maximize button for instance, it will just take of a fixed button
number, regardless of it's function binding.  With this patch, you can
assign any number of buttons as being menu/maximize/minimize buttons
(as discussed before, it is not a good idea to do this automatically
since a function's binding may be complex).

Regards,
Andrew

This is Netscape and not FVWM as far as I know.

Try this defaults setting:

Netscape*editingTranslations: #override \n\

Subject: FVWM: No FvwmButtons displayed

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


Greetings,

Last week I made the decision to move from fvwm 1.xx to 2.xx.
I dowloaded the latest version fvwm-2.0.45 and I upgraded
my config file as explained in the doc.

Everything works fine except the FvwmButtons. I had
a couple of GoodStuff buttons which I want to convert
into FvwmButtons. But whatever I try in the .fvwm2rc
I cannot get any buttons displayed on my screen.

Looking at the source directory in modules/FvwmButtons,
I recompiled the module with the various debug flags
set. The output is as follow :

FvwmButtons: Parsing...OK
FvwmButtons: Shuffling...OK
FvwmButtons: Loading data...
FvwmButtons: Loading: Button 0x804bf00: colors, colors2

Well, it seems correct !

After having launched the FvwmTalk I tried the
example samplebuttonrc given with the module.
The only thing I got was a xclock located
at a strange position in a right hand desktop.
If I moved into this desktop, the clock escaped
further to the right !

Similarly, if I make use of the system.fvwm2rc provided
with the package, I got a FvwmTalk window when I fired
up the Buttons module. It's very confusing !

I have tried to check out the page at the specified URL in
the README : http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html.
Unfortunately the link is out of date :-(

I browsed the archive of the mailing list looking for
articles about Buttons but the output of the
search engine is not easy to manage.

Here are the spec of my configuration :

Linux 2.1.26
gcc version 2.7.2
XFree86 11.0 vendor release number:    3120

And last, the paragraph in my .fvwm2rc dealing with
the buttons :

#  				FvwmButtons button-bar

*FvwmButtonsFore 	Black
*FvwmButtonsBack 	Red
*FvwmButtonsFont 	-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmButtonsGeometry -135-5

*FvwmButtonsFont -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*
*FvwmButtonsPadding 2 2

*FvwmButtons(Title Kill, Icon rbomb.xpm, Action Destroy)

*FvwmButtons(Title Mail, Icon mail.xpm , Action \
	'Exec "Mail" /usr/local/bin/ml &')

   	'Exec "Netscape" netbrowser &')

	'Exec "Calculator" xcalc &')
*FvwmButtons(Title  Xpal, Icon xpaint.xpm, Action \
  	'Exec "Palette" xpal &')

Thanks in advance for your help,

There's something wrong here...
You ask for a buttonbar with 1 button width, and 1 button height...

I don't know if it'll solve your problem, but I do know that this is
wrong ;).

Hi,
	I have faced the same problem with FvwmButtons of version
2.0.45 and hence now, run FvwmButtons 2.0.40 with fvwm 2.0.45 to
get the best of both worlds.
	However FvwmButtons 2.0.40 is primitive compared with the
2.0.45 version :( By the way, if you compile FvwmButtons 2.0.40
with the XPM flag turned OFF, it works fine, but alas you can't
display colour buttons. I had posted similar queries on this
mailing list, but got no solution.


regards,
sumeet

Following your suggestion, I've installed the 2.0.40 version
of the Buttons modules and I've now my set of buttons
available as with fvwm 1.xx. Great !

However, it would be nice to fix the problem to take full
advantage of the last release.

Thank you very much for your advice,

One of the problems in your config is that you specify both rows and =

I ran into the same problem with CDE on Solaris 2.5.1. To fix this I
placed the following line in my ~/.dt/sessions/sessionetc file:

xpmroot /usr/local/include/X11/pixmaps/background5.xpm &

or something like

xsetroot -bitmap new_spegetti.bmp -fg "#880000" -bg "#480000"

It seems that setting the root window returns the cursor to normal
when it is done.

I hope this helps,
Carvel

I've got a visually impaired user that has a question. He's used a tool
called "puff" or "xpuff" in the past to magnify his view of the screen. The
tools sucks up a fair amount of CPU time & for other reasons, he'd like to
quit using it. What he wants is to fire up xterms with huge fonts (that span
muliple viewports) & have fvwm track his xterm text cursor & automatically
shift the viewport as necessary when he gets close to the edge of the screen. 
Is that possible? Are there any other better ideas?

thanks!

Just a suggestion (two, really):

1.)  I have at times activated the FvwmPager's screen scrolling feature to
allow for smooth scrolling across the screen (smooth, that is, if enough
CPU cycles are available).  The hook to this *MIGHT* be available through
mouse or keyboard actions, or (I believe) could be cobbled in using
FvwmCommand mechanisms if the pager were able to listen to such commands.
I haven't used such features yet, but I know that things are being done
that I consider amazing.

2.)  If your user uses a Linux box (or anything else that uses XFree86,
then the hardware scrolling might be the best bet, and certainly would
be the fastest and least CPU intensive route.  With a moderately coarse
resolution, your user might be able to set up an 80x<something> terminal
spanning two or three physical viewscreens and be able to use the cursor.
If there are no other options (somewhat surprising if true) then getting a
17" terminal running at 1024x768 at 8 bpp may be usable for him with maybe
4 virtual screens available with hardware scrolling.

I saw your first posting of this question, and expected that others would
answer.  I guess that's what everyone thought.  I hope this suggestion is
useful, and I hope your mailbox doesn't get swamped with other
apologetically phrased but identical suggestions.

You might try one of the Tcl/Tk terminal emulators, such as "tkterm" or "Tkt",
(See the Tcl/Tk FAQ, e.g.  http://www.sco.com/technology/tcl/tclFAQ/part4/faq.html)

I don't know if any of the Tk terminal emulators have horizontal scrolling,
but it should be trivial to add.  This would entirely eliminate the need
to deal with virtual screens.  One could also add a pager with zoom in/out
quite easily.  The only difficulty is producing a termcap/terminfo entry that
is limited to the subset of ANSI escape sequences implemented by the emulator.
Some of the emulators listed in the Tcl FAQ may come with modified termcap/terminfo
entries.

Hi,

I was wanting to make a module that would implement the M_String 
message to receive strings from a button click.  The only problem is 
I can not find any information on the packet format in any of the 
documents.  I am guessing that I will have to take apart the module.c 
code to figure it out.  From what I have seen, it will send the 
command to all modules of that name.  Since I plan to have multiple 
copies of the module loaded and I plan on using a mouse click on a 
title button for the modules window to issue the command, how do I 
know that the message is for the particular module that the title 
button was clicked?  (I hope I worded that correctly).

This is my first attempt at writing a module.  A user at my company 
wants to have an rxvt window with button on the title that send 
special commands to the shell that is in the window.  Therefore, I am 
attempting to modify the rxvt code to make it an fvwm module that 
will accept the M_String sent to it from a SendToModule command tied 
to a button on the title.  Is this feasible?  I have not looked at 
the rxvt code yet; I thought I would see if it was doable from fvwm 
side of things first.

Thanks for the help!

The M_STRING packet has 4 values in the body: 3 zeros, followed by the string
itself. It gets sent via:

SendToModule <pat> <str>

where <pat> is a pattern specifiying which module or modules receive <str>.
The problem here is that you are considering turning rxvt into a module, for
arguments' sake we'll call it FvwmRxvt, which will be sent some string via a
button on the title bar. So that button is bound to do:

SendToModule FvwmRxvt <str>

Let's say the user has 3 of these rxvt instances active when he clicks the
button on one of them... all 3 will get the packet.

Why would you want to make a terminal application into an fvwm module?  It
would appear to me (lowly nonprogrammer that I am) that you would prefer
to modify the underlying application to take special actions when the
button is clicked.  Like what xterm does with <Ctrl><Mouse-1/2/3>.
Couldn't you put the desired features of xterm back into rxvt more easily
than taking the decidedly specialized action of relying on fvwm?

I realize that.  I was hopping that the information send with the 
packet contained the window ID of the window the button was clicked 
on.  If that information was also sent, it would make the 
SendToModule function much more powerfull for the case of multiple 
modules being used.

I will have to look into Chuck's suggestion of using xse.  I have not 
heard of that program before.  Thanks for the help and suggestions.

I never knew xterm did special things with the <ctrl><Mouse-1/2/3>!  
But, this does not give the functionality that they user wants.  He 
wants buttons in the title bar area (that is controled by fvwm) to 
execute scripts inside the rxvt window.  To extend the rxvt program 
to do these features would make the window larger since I would have 
to basically put a menu bar area that would have buttons on it.  
Also, to have the configurability that the user wanted would take 
quit a bit of added programming.  Therefore, it seemed to me to be 
easier to make it into an fvwm module that gets the M_String message 
from fvwm and sends it to the shell that is in use.  Since fvwm 
already handles configureable buttons and popup menus, I would not 
have to do as much programming (Okay, I'm lazy!).

Also, I do not know X programming yet.  Therefore, I could make these 
changes without having to learn a new programming environment (I 
believe.  I have not dived into the rxvt code yet!).

I seem to recall that the latest rxvt release, 2.21 I think, implements an
experimental configurable menu-bar in the first line of the display(?)

Though not the buttons in the title bar you want -- rather unstandard, I
may add -- it may do what your client wants.

The window ID is only sent to a module when the module is executed. It is sent
as one of the command-line arguments. The value is zero if the module was not
started in the context of an existant window (from a titlebar button or some
such), that is, if it was launched from the dot-file or from a root-window
menu.

The only packets that contain window identification are those which contain
data specific to a window-- iconification, configuration, resource names, etc.
M_STRING is a broadcast packet, and thus is not tied to a specific window.

Anyone know a canonical site for rxvt? I can only find 2.20 at ftp archives
and no information on development.

I tried posting the following to fvwm-workers but received no response,
so will try the (presumably larger) audience of the main fvwm list.
Anyone have any comments?

[fvwm 2.0.43, Tcl 8.0a2, Tk 8.0a2, IRIX 6.2]

I'm having problems with input focus when using Tcl/Tk 8.0a2 and fvwm2.0.43
together.  Things worked fine with pre-8.0 versions of Tcl/Tk, so I suspect
this is a Tcl/Tk bug rather than an fvwm bug, but I thought I'd run it by
you folks and see what people think.

I'm using MouseFocus, have "DeskTopSize 2x4", and have bound some keypad
keys to go to various pages on my desktop, i.e.:

Key KP_Home     A       N       GoToPage 0 0
Key KP_Up       A       N       GoToPage 1 0
[etc]

Now, say I have a wish window open on Page 0,0 and an xterm in approximately
the same position on Page 1,0, and I move the mouse into the wish window.
That window gets the input focus, as is appropriate.  If I now switch to
Page 1,0 using KP_Up, the mouse pointer is in the xterm... but input focus
is still in the (no longer visible) wish window.  Wish is the only
application I've found with this annoying habit of retaining the input
focus.

A little playing around with "xev" shows that in this situation the wish
window is probably receiving a FocusOut event, but not a LeaveNotify event...
whereas both events are generated if I switch desktops by moving the
mouse.   I'm guessing that wish is ignoring FocusOut events and only
obeying LeaveNotify events...

I've pretty much reached the limit of my meager X knowledge here.  Should
wish be smart enough to relinquish the input focus on the basis of a
FocusOut event?  Or is this an fvwm bug - should fvwm be sending LeaveNotify
to the current window when I switch to a different desktop page with a
GotoPage function?

I recently grabbed the Rasterman's rxvt from:

http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/linux_rxvt.html

This  version supports pixmaps in the  background.  Possibly you could
use the pixmap background as a way  of providing the menu-bar you want
to click on.  A minor  hack to the source  code could detect where you
clicked and run the command you want.

True, but you might be able to use a hack like this (I haven't tried it
out, but it oughta work).  Create a function:

AddToFunction MySendToModule "I" SendToModule $0 $w $1

(or something like that) and call MySendToModule instead.  Then have
the pseudo-rxvt parse the window-id out of the string, and ignore the
message if it's not that instance's id.

This is just an idea - I certainly haven't tested it.  Is $w even still
implemented in 2.0.45?

The only site that actually carries it seems to be its home site:

ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/unix/X11/terms/rxvt/

I don't really know why all others still carry v.2.20, which is buggy and
incomplete.

Any changes from 2.043 to 2.045 that should require a tweak

This is on AIX 4.1.5

Hi,

I recently started using fvwm95 ... Not because it looks like Win95 but
because I kinda like to change every now and then my window manager and
try to make it more interesting .... (so far I have tried most of them)


Is there any way to have a button bar in a vertical orientation instead of
horizontal? Moreover: how can I put xbiff as an icon in the button bar...
You know, to have the icon that indicates new mail by changing from flag
down to flag up (for example) in the button bar instead of lying around
somewhere ...

I would appreciate any tip on that. Thanks in advance.

Elias

When you say button bar you mean FvwmButtons and not the
TaskBar unique to Fvwm95 ( can't help with that one) ???
Assuming you do mean FvwmButtons If you open the .fvwm2rc95 (or
whatever) file in your favourite text editor scroll through it
until you find a line something like

*FvwmButtons Rows 1

and change it to read
 
*FvwmButtons Columns 1

That should get you a vertical button bar where the buttons fill
up from the top down. 

If you want xbiff in your bar instead of floating around the
desktop then add a line like this

*FvwmButtons - whatever  Swallow "xbiff" Exec /usr/local/bin/xbiff &

Presumably because the current maintainer hasn't told anybody about the new 
version.  (In particular, he/she hasn't submitted it to the obvious places 
like ftp.x.org, sunsite.unc.edu, etc.)

If I'd wanted to find the home site for rxvt, how would I have known that it's 
ftp.fu-berlin.de?  There's no mention of that site in the sources to 
rxvt-2.20. Indeed, a quick scan through Deja News suggests that there's a 
"math" missing: it should be ftp.math.fu-berlin.de, with the home page 
allegedly <URL:http://www.math.fu.berlin.de/~kesim/rxvt>, although I can't 
contact either site (I think that's our problem---we have some connectivity 
problems with Germany at present).

The URL I stated is correct, I checked it out before posting and rxvt 2.21
is there.

I now remember having notice of the new release directly from the author.
I wrote him about some problems in v.2.20.  I then found version 2.21
with an ftp search engine "http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch/"

The real problem most probably is that rxvt doesn't have a *stable*
mantainer from a long time.

Anyway, this is the lsm file from v.2.21

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Begin3
Title:		rxvt
Version:	2.21
Entered-date:	03FEB97

Description:	Rxvt is an 8-bit clean, colour xterm replacement that uses
		significantly less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly
		since it doesn't support toolkit configurability or Tek
		graphics, but also since features can be removed at
		compile-time to reflect your needs.  Some rxvt features
		(compilation dependent): ANSI-color, bold/blink attributes
		modify foreground/background colours, scrollbars with arrow
		buttons, kanji and greek support, printer-pipe, XPM
		backgounds with on-the-fly scaling, user-definable menus.

		The distribution also includes rclock, the smaller/better
		xclock replacement with appointment scheduling and xbiff
		functionality.

Keywords:	rxvt colour color kanji xterm X11 vt100 terminal-emulator
		rclock xbiff xpm menu

Author:		* John Bovey [Univ. Kent at Canterbury] was the creator of
		  the original xvt.

		* Rob Nation [Lockheed] re-wrote most of xvt to make a
		  substantiallly enhanced version called rxvt (Rob's xvt)
		  and also wrote rclock (Rob's clock).

		* Mark Olesen [Queen's Univ. at Kingston] made various
		  improvements and cleanups.

That url is not quite right. It should be
  http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~kesim/rxvt/
which is the rxvt homepage. Exactly what I was looking for.

I'd already tried Rasterman's rxvt-xpm, which is funky but a bit
slow. I wanted to try the official rxvt with the new menubar code.

Thanks to everyone for the pointers.

Hi,
I recently downloaded fvwm-1.24r.tar.gz from sunsite.unc.edu.  I
recently installed GNU GCC 2.7.2.2 for doing all my compiling.  However,
I'm not having much luck compiling FVWM.  One of the error messages I
get is the following:
-------
gcc -o FvwmWinList FvwmWinList.o List.o ButtonArray.o Mallocs.o Colors.o
-O  -lXext -lX11 -L../../libs -lfvwmlib
collect2: ld returned 4 exit status
ld: -lXext: No such file or directory  

-------
The library libXext.a exists in the /usr/openwin/lib subdirectory.  I
can't seem to figure out why it can't be found.
---------------------------------------
The other error message I get is the following:

Makefile:275: *** missing separator.  Stop.


This occurs in the 'fvwm' subdirectory.  The following is line 275 from
the Makefile:

InstallNamedNonExec(../sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwmrc,system.fvwmrc,"/usr/lib/X11/fvwm") 

I have no idea what it's suppose to do or what it is suppose to look
like.
---------------------------------------

Any helpful hints would be greatly appreciated.
Are there any PRECOMPILED fvwm BINARIES for the SunOS 4.1.3_U1
platform???

TIA for your comments and suggestions!

Hi,
	I have a major problem here. One of our people has written an
applications which takes image frames from a camera and displays them.
For displaying the images, it has to create a colormap of it's own,
as the default colormap doesn't have enough space left - normally.

	The problem I am facing is, that fvwm is not able to switch
to the private colormap - try what I may. I have tried by changing
ColormapFocus and ClickToFocus etc. but to no avail. Strangely, this
problem does not occur in other applications that we have written.
By the way, we have also installed an event handler inside the applications
that installs the private colormap when the mouse enters the window.
But the moment it installs the colormap, somebody immediately installs
back the default one :(

	Please throw light. We are using fvwm2.0.45 on a Sun Ultra
running SunOS 5.5.1

thanks,
sumeet

Check the mailing list archives, I posted a bit on this a few months ago.
Basically what fvwm does is broken.

Hello,

I'm in trouble with fvwm2  2.0.43 and  NumLock set to ON.
It is not possible to change the focus between any window if Numlock is
set to on. Maybe this might be a general prob with my xmodmap, but
actually I don't know how to resolve the puzzle.

here's an excerpt of my fvwm2rc

sorry about this again. I'm sure that those without sodding CDE will be sick of
this by now, but it's a real pain to me.

summary: change window manager on CDE with
		*wmStartupCommand:	in .Xdefaults file

then cde runs as it would with dtwm (native win man) except that on key/mouse
presses will be accepted for quite some time. dtwm has no problem with this at
all. it only occurs when the window manager is changed.


things I've noticed: substituting olwm with fvwm (in the openwin option) does
not set the enviroment properly. using the script sessionetc in .dt/sessions
does not change the problem as it occurs before sessionetc is executed.

therefore CDE is waiting for something that dtwm does which other win man don't
do.

does anyone know how to resolve this?

Graeme

(p.s. I'm having trouble posting to newsgroups. could someone post this for me)

Hi, 

We have some X/Motif application running on fvwm window manager 
environment. There is a menu item in it, which pops up a window. 
Usually, it's popped up at the position where that menu item is 
selected. However, if that menu item lies close to the boundary 
of the screen, the pop-up window will be popped up part off the 
screen(or pager). 

If this application is run on mwm, no matter where the menu item is,
the pop-up window will always be forced in the current screen.
Is there any way we can achieve the same result as mwm?
 
Environment: fvwm2.045 with X11R5 and Motif 1.2.4 on SunOS 4.1.4. 

If you know how to make fvwm1.* work, please let me know also. 

Thanks for your help!

--Hailin 

P.S: I seldom read the fvwm mailing list. When you reply this 
     message, would you please send "cc:hailin@htc.com" to me?

I have the same problem.  At login the busy cursor is displayed for about a 
minute until soemthing times out.  Not only that but something (not Fvwm) warps 
the cursor back to the centre of the screen during this time.

Here I go again with another module packet suggestion. This time if it gets
added I promise to document it in the modules.tex :-). 

I've had a request to make is so that FvwmIconMan could follow the fvwm window
list order exactly. This is currently quite difficult to do as the list order
changes silently at various times, and there's no way to really tell from
outside of fvwm. For example, my perusal of the fvwm code shows that FlipFocus
changes the window list order, while Focus does not. There's no way for a
module to tell which of these happened from watching the messages from fvwm.

So, my proposal is a new packet type which keeps modules informed of any
changes to the window list order. 

Other modules, current and potential, could benefit from this as well.

This brings up a more general class of features. Fvwm maintains some important
data structures, and it would be nice if modules could be able to access them,
either in a read-only or read-write fashion. A packet listing whatever changes
have occured to the window list order is a simple way of implementing
read-only access to a portion of the window list. Can anyone think of other
things in this class?

Content-description: Mail message body

Hi,

Well, I created my first module!  I took the Xse program and adapted 
it for use as an Fvwm module.  Attached is the tar and gziped file 
containing the module.  I compiled it as though it was in the modules 
subdirectory.  Since I have done very little unix programming, I will 
only garentee that it will compile on my system (A Sparc Startion 2 
running Solaris 2.5.1 using the GNU gcc compiler).  Try it on other 
systems and see if it runs.

I do not have an ftp or WEB site that I can place this program 
(company policies does not allow me to but this on our site).  
Therefore, could someone make this available on the WEB?

I believe that this is a very useful function that would be nice to 
include in the final distribution.

Subject: FVWM: feature patch: fixed icons
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi,

Summary: patches enclosed (one regular, one unified format) implement
the IconFix function, which makes an icon stick to its position as if
it was moved zero distance.  Man page updated, too.  Trivial changes
were required for the implementation.

----

I switched to fvwm about 6 months ago, and it's great.  The extensive
customization features sets it apart from most other window managers...

By way of background, once on the screen, I prefer things to stay put.
In fact, the main reason I went to fvwm is so that I can make moving and
resizing windows "much harder" from an interface standpoint (I have
move/raise and resize/raise do the move or resize function only when
control is pressed).  Similarly, I prefer the icon for a given program
to always appear in the same place.

Though the IconBox style is very useful, the box implements a
last-in, first-position placement scheme (yes, I could use an IconBox
per program, but I want groups of programs in the same box).  I
noticed that if an icon was moved, it stuck to the new position (in
the code, ICON_MOVED can be set but never unset, in fact).  After
a trivial modification, I introduced a new function called IconFix
which "moves" the icon zero distance once placed (by setting ICON_MOVED),
thus fixing the icon's position.

I implemented the interface much the same way the "Sticky" attribute
is implemented (Sticky was my implementation template -- valid??).
The way I use the IconFix function is this:

  bring up fvwm
  run all programs
  let fvwm position icons in the IconBox(es)
  shuffle icons if necessary (by ordering of opens and closes)
  run IconFix from each window's menu

One could also use icon geometries, but coverage across all apps is
varied, and plus, I really like the notion of IconBoxes, where "permanent"
windows have icons in known locations, while apps that come and go
are in the expected general area.  I also like the nice spacing that the
initial auto-placement offers.

Hi,

I'm running Redhat LINUX from an Intel Pentium using FVWM2.

When I start Emacs from my button bar

*FvwmButtons (Title "Emacs", Action `Exec emacs &', Icons emacs.xpm)

the print function in Emacs does not work. Normally my environment is set
in /etc/csh.cshrc to (using tcsh)

setenv PRINTER "dj500"

in order to print from a C-Shell or a program started from a C-Shell.
However, this setting is obviously not available for programs started from
the button bar? 

Does anybody know how to solve this problem?

Any help is appreciated!

Create a shell script to run when you click the button rather than just
running emacs.  Using sh, you could do something such as:

#!/bin/sh
export PRINTER=hp300
/usr/local/bin/emacs -display :0.0
exit


Change the path to emacs, whatever the path to emacs is on your
system, the display you're on, and your PRINTER variable, and you should
be set.
Then replace that entry for the button to run the shell script instead of
emacs.


Cheers,
Scott

Hi,
 
I'm running Redhat LINUX from an Intel Pentium using FVWM2.
 
When I start Emacs from my button bar
 
*FvwmButtons (Title "Emacs", Action `Exec emacs &', Icons emacs.xpm)
 
the print function in Emacs does not work. Normally my environment is
set
in /etc/csh.cshrc to (using tcsh)
 
setenv PRINTER "dj500"
 
in order to print from a C-Shell or a program started from a C-Shell.
However, this setting is obviously not available for programs started
from
the button bar?
 
Does anybody know how to solve this problem?
 
Any help is appreciated!

My first contribution to the internet. This patch displays the WindowList
function (not the FvwmWinList module) alphabetized by window/icon name
rather than by hotkey. It makes it easier to find the window you are
looking for. 

The patch is a context diff to be applied to fvwm-2.0.45, included to this
e-mail as a MIME attachment.

There is a function AddToMenu0, which is identical to the original
AddToMenu, with the addition of a boolean 'sort' argument. The original
AddToMenu gets #define'd to AddToMenu0(false), and a new macro
SortedAddToMenu gets #define'd to AddToMenu0(true). The new code is in
menus.c. The menus.h diff reflects the new #define's and AddToMenu0
header, and the windows.c diff reflects the use of SortedAddToMenu.

	It would be a good thing if FvwmIconMan could display icons
horizontally also, rather than vertically only (as it does now). This
would enable one to stick a task bar sort of thing at the bottom of
the page.

	Instead of running emacs directly from the button run a
small script to do your environment setting and then to exec emacs.
It would be something like this.

*FvwmButtons (Title "Emacs", Action `Exec em', Icons emacs.xpm)

chmod u+x em

where em is a file like:

#! /bin/csh -f
setenv PRINTER "dj500"
exec emacs

Well, I guess it would be solved by the window manager making available to
the programs, all the environments that it has available to itself as
defined by the shell that starts the window manager... What I mean is that
the .xsession or .xinitrc or WHATEVER that calls fvwm2 is simply a shell
script, and if you set environments within that shell script, fvwm2 should
make those environments available to the programs that fvwm2 starts...
Currently, only a few environments are made available to programs...
$HOME, $PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and a few other vital ones... 

What you could do is create a little wrap around shell script to run all
your programs... If you use the cshell by default, it could look like
this:

------ Begin CSH shell script -----

#!/bin/csh -f
# This is a csh wrapper to start an X app with certain default system
# environments

# The following sources the system default .cshrc
source /etc/csh.cshrc

# Here we add any other possibly required miscellaneous variables

#setenv ENVIRONMENT blah

# Here we execute whatever arguments are thrown at us...

exec $*

----- end CSH shell script -----

A similar /bin/sh script would be easy. Simply throw this into
/usr/X11/bin (for example called fXrun -- for fvwm2 X run, or something)
and then in your .fvwm2rc, call programs with it:

+	"Emacs"		Exec exec fXrun emacs --someoption \
				 --someotheroption &
+	"xv"		Exec exec fXrun xv &

and that'd be it...

Ummm .... FvwmIconMan *does* allow you to display icon-buttons
horizontally; i've got it doing that right now.  I'm using
FvwmIconMan-0.9.8 with the following sort of configuration:

 *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers	1
 *FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry	m4_eval(WIDTH / 8)x24
 *FvwmIconMan*1*managergeometry	8x1+0-0
 *FvwmIconMan*font		helvetica-12
 *FvwmIconMan*format		"%i"
 *FvwmIconMan*background		DarkGray
 *FvwmIconMan*foreground		Black
 *FvwmIconMan*plainbutton	up
 *FvwmIconMan*focusbutton	down
 *FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton	down
 *FvwmIconMan*selectbutton	up
 *FvwmIconMan*1*title		{TaskBar}
 *FvwmIconMan*1*iconname		{TaskBar}
 *FvwmIconMan*drawicons		true
 *FvwmIconMan*followfocus	true
 *FvwmIconMan*sort		true
 *FvwmIconMan*usewinlist		false
 *FvwmIconMan*1*dontshow		resource=FvwmIconMan resource=FvwmPager resource=FvwmButtons resource=asclock resource=xmailbox resource=xeyes resource=NoResource
 *FvwmIconMan*resolution		desk
 *FvwmIconMan*action		Mouse 1 A sendcommand "Iconify -1", sendcommand "Focus", sendcommand "Raise"
 *FvwmIconMan*action		Mouse 2 A sendcommand "Iconify"
 *FvwmIconMan*action		Mouse 3 A sendcommand "Iconify -1", sendcommand "Focus", sendcommand "Lower"
 *FvwmIconMan*action		Mouse 1 S sendcommand "Iconify -1", sendcommand "Focus", sendcommand "Raise", sendcommand "WindowShade 2"
 *FvwmIconMan*action		Mouse 3 S sendcommand "Iconify -1", sendcommand "Focus", sendcommand "Raise", sendcommand "WindowShade 1"

Note that `WIDTH' is something defined by FvwmM4, which is called with
the -m4-prefix argument.  `helvetica-12' is aliased to the local
variant of helvetica 12 point in a local fonts.alias file.

Is that true?  My understanding was that all environment variables got passed 
on (so long as the shell which runs .xsession or whatever exports them, of 
course).  Is this not true?  Does fvwm2 *really* pick and choose which 
variables to pass on?

What's more likely is that the person is running xdm, which runs .xsession, 
and so never actually runs csh at all until they get an xterm up.  So the 
environment variables exist in the xterms, but not in anything else, and in 
particular not in fvwm2 and modules.  The trick there is to ensure that the 
variables are set (and exported) in .xsession or .xinitrc.

Hello,

I tried to bind FlipFocus to a key, to be able to switch input focus
quickly between two windows (I use clicktofocus).

It only raises the one window that already has focus though.

Is this a known bug, or am I doing something wrong?

You need to bind "Prev [...] FlipFocus" to a key, rather than
FlipFocus itself.

Hi,

I would like to find if there is a new home site for FvwmButtons,
the one given in the distribution's README seems to be out of
business. Also, has this module been updated since the last
Fvwm packing (2.0.45).

Thanks

Herve

I agree with Bruce. I had a similar problem with emacs and Fvwm not
recognizing my environment variables and it was because I had a check
in my .cshrc that looked to see if it was being 'executed' in an
interactive shell or not. If not (which is the case when I first
login), then it would exit at that point and not finish the stuff
below it. A lot of my environment variables happened to be set below
this checkpoint so I was losing them in Fvwm and anything else that was
started from the .xinitrc. My xterms were fine because they were
interactive.

I would suggest reading the man pages for login and csh or whatever
shell you use to really understand the order of things.

In my case, yes. I don't believe I've ever been able to pass weird
environment variables. I know this because I once tried it with my IRC
environments. I set them in my .xsession hoping they'd get passed to
irc, but it never happened... I think I saw this come up on the list one
time earlier as well..... The case isn't that fvwm2 is picking and
choosing, I think the case is that it's not passing ANY... It grabs it's
PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH when necessary, and runs what it has to run.

Well... I do tend to make sure to take care of my .xsession... It took me
1.5 years before I figured out how to make one .xsession work on Solaris,
IRIX, Linux, and whatever else you might throw my way...

The man page for the program explains all of the details.  Briefly,
this program allows you to send ANY X Windows events to any window in 
the system.  An example of it's use is to load the module upon
initialization of fvwm (see fvwm.man for details), then have this in
your fvwm2rc file:

Mouse 2 4 A SendToModule FvwmXse $w <key>l <key>s <key>Return

Then when you click the second mouse button on the 4th title bar
button, the window will recieve an X Windows event that says the
keyboard sent "ls<Return>" to that window.  Fvwm puts the window ID in
place of the "$w".  You could also specify ClickWindow to send to the
next window the 1 mouse button is clicked on, PointerWindow to send to
the window that the pointer is over, InputFocus to send the the window
that has keyboard focus, or you can specify the windows name.  When
the window name is given, the program does a search for that name
which is somewhat slow.

I hope this helps clearify what the module does.

That's odd.  As far as I can see (just skimming through the code), fvwm2 is 
doing a fork(2) which preserves the environment, followed by an execl(3) which 
also preserves the environment.  (This is for exec_command, which I assume 
FvwmButtons and things also use.  If you also use xrsh, then be aware that 
xrsh only carries a few variables to the remote machine by default.)

A quick check (setting *and exporting* the variable FOOBAR in .xsession and
logging out and back in again) shows that FOOBAR is carried through correctly. 
 I'd guess this is not fvwm2's problem---it's either user error, or some weird 
difference in how fork/execl behave on your machine (I'm using Solaris2.5).

I want to bind a key to do something to some windows and something else to other 
windows.  Is this possible already?  What I am thinking of is a command that 
works like Next but that only operates on the currently focused window.  The 
command could be If (with an IfNot of course) and could be used e.g.

AddToFunc somefunc "I" If    [ Xterm ] WindowShade
+                  "I" IfNot [ Xterm ] Iconify

I thought this could this be done with

AddToFunc somefunc "I" Next [ $w Xterm ] WindowShade
+                  "I" Next [ $w !Xterm ] Iconify

But it looks like ! can only be used to negate the iconic|currentdesk conditions
and can't be used to negate on window names/classes.

I know I could use different titlebar buttons or keys to do the different 
actions but I really want to be able to use the keypad period key as a Go-Away
key that would do appropriate things to different windows.

Am I correct in assuming that most of the pattern matching stuff is already 
written in the Next/Prev/None commands?

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

It not that fvwm is  not passing the environment variable.  What I 
have found is that if the script that launches fvwm is different than 
the shell that you have your environment variables set, then you will 
not get the environment in fvwm that you thought you were.  For 
example, for a while a bourne shell was used to execute my .xinitrc 
file while I use zsh for my main shell.  In this case, I did not get 
my environment variables set because they are set in my .zshrc file 
and not my .profile file.  When I switch my .xinitrc file to run as a 
zsh program, then I got the environment that I expected to get.  
Therefore, if you are using a csh, make sure that the script that 
launches your fvwm session is also a csh script!

So what all this eventually works down to is:

If you don't set your variables, you cannot use them.

Sorry I sent it to the wrong address.  I assumed the stuff at the end 
of the messages was how to properly subscripe and un-subscribe like 
most lists show.

I have removed the address, but, you know, there's a reason that at the
bottom of every single message that comes from this list there's a line
that tells you the address to use for reporting problems.

well, this can be a problem. Sun OS's (in my experience) don't care what
shell you specify for your .xinitrc or .xsession, Solaris will always
process it as a /bin/sh script. Besides, you can set environment variables
inside a shell script. It's not hard to add a line like 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

or something like that, but even doing this, it doesn't work...

Yeah, but it only works if you're smarter than the average rock!

export VAR=value

only works in ksh (and zsh and bash)

if it's plain sh you have to do

VAR=value
...
export VAR VAR2 VAR3

I'm quite sure I used to have Solaris running my .xinitrc as a ksh
script, but that was over 6 months ago, in a previous life...

I am having trouble compiling fvwm2.0.45 on my Sparc IPC with Solaris
2.5.1 and gcc2.7.2.2.  I am positive that I am having a problem with my
imake configuration, as I also cannot compile XPM.

Can anyone point me to a good reference for 'fixing' my imake
configuration, as the FAQ says?  I am afraid the documentation available
to me right now that I _have_ found is almost useless to me.

thanks

Well, I meant to type that... I've tried every single which way... It took

As others have commented, that's the wrong syntax.

I put the line

FOOBAR=froopy; export FOOBAR

in my .xinitrc, and nowhere else (not in any of my .zshrc or other files, and 
it sure seemed to exist in xterms spawned from fvwm2 spawned from the 
.xsession/.xinitrc (which are the same file in my setup).  I'm using Solaris 
2.5.1, fvwm 2.0.45 and xdm.

Can you track down your problem further?  Does the same happen with other 
window managers?  Does your ps(1) have options for looking at the environment 
of running processes?  ("ps -eww" used to work on BSDish boxes.)

One possibility that occurs is that your .xinitrc/.xsession isn't being 
executed at all!  I've used at least one system where the default "ow3" 
command to start OpenWindows was a perl script which didn't execute any 
scripts in the users' directories at all.  Perhaps your xdm has been hacked up 
similarly?

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi,

I have just compiled fvwm 2.0.45 for AIX 4.1.4.0 after using it for a
long time under SunOS.  

fvwm seem to work until it tries to Exec something.  Then it locks.
Swallowing anything except fwvm modules in FvwmButtons cause the same
lock.  Any ideas?

I had a problem compiling it, xmkmf complains:

[zeise] 4:fvwm-2.0.45>xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
"./Imakefile", line 51.1: 1506-215 (E) Too many arguments specified for macro NamedTargetSubdirs.

Line 51 reads:
MakeSubdirs($(SUBDIRS))

Instead I used ./MakeMakefiles, it caused the same error in all
subdirectories, but Imake had done _something_, at least the libXpm
directory had successfully been put into the Makefiles, and fvwm
compiled without problems.

Any help will be appreciated.  I can live with mwm for a while,
but... :-)

Best regards,

Jakob

That syntax is fine when using bash.

I'd just like to comment that I have never had a problem with
environment variables and fvwm under Solaris or NetBSD.  I start my X
session with `ssh-agent startx' to make a SSH_ environment variables
available to every program started by fvwm.

Same here, sort of.

.xsession:

#!/bin/sh

GNU_SECURE=/etc/gnu.rhosts			; export GNU_SECURE

eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add </dev/null

xhost -

All of those explicitly set variables, and the SSH_* variables carry
through to all apps without problems at all. FreeBSD 3.0.

run.

Any ideas?

Hi,

I recently got FVWM 2.0.45 up on my Sun Ultra2 with Solaris 5.

Since then, I have been having a problem with communication between 
GNU Emacs 19.34 and Netscape 3.0.

When reading mail with VM, I used to be able to click the middle mouse
button on a URL and it would send a message to netscape to open that
URL. Since moving from olvwm (yuck!) to FVWM (yay!), this hasn't
worked. I get a message "Sending URL to Netscape... Done." but nothing
actually happens.

Again, as far as I know, the only change has been in the window manager!

Thanks,

Andrew

for the life of me I cannot remember how to do escape codes in a fvwmrc

for instance, I want to set the title of rxvt to include the version...

according to the faq, one does it by setting the title with the escape
sequence of "esc[8n" in it, which im assuming will turn into the version
number.. 

any ideas?

I can't seem to get keybindings to work on teh numpad when numlock is on, the lines I have are:

############################################################################

Key KP_Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100
Key KP_Begin       A       C       Refresh


## let's try it with the numbers

Key KP_4           A       C       Scroll -100 +0

Key KP_5           A       C       Refresh

while numlock is off, control-numpad-arrow works fine, but when numlock is on, nothing happens.

Is there something I missed, or is this a "feature" in fvwm-2.0.45 ?

This is because numlock is a modifier.  Try xmodmap -pm to see which
one it is.  Include key bindings in your .fvwmrc with that modifier in
addition to the ones you already have.

Does this work?

The -login option causes the shell to parse the init files
anyway, so I can put all the export stuff in my ~/.profile.

They are really called xterm escape sequences, which rxvt supports.
Here's an example for bash which sets the title and icon name.

xterm-title ()
{
    if [ -n "$1" ]
    then
        builtin echo -e -n "\033]2;$1\007"
    else
        builtin echo -e -n "\033]2;${WHOAMI}@${HOSTNAME}:${PWD}\007"
    fi	
}

xterm-icon ()
{
    if [ -n "$1" ]
    then
        builtin echo -e -n "\033]1;$1\007"
    else
        builtin echo -e -n "\033]1;${HOSTNAME}\007"
    fi	
}

cd ()
{
    if [ "$1" = "" ]
    then
        builtin cd
    else
        builtin cd "$@"
    fi

    if [ $TERM = "xterm" ]
    then
        xterm-title
        xterm-icon
    fi
}

Does anybody know how to configure the Emacs icon title so that the
         filename of the current buffer 
appears in the title instead of 
	emacs@HOSTNAME ?

I have been thinking about this problem for a while and I'm not sure if
this is an Emacs problem or if this can be configured by fvwm.

Modify icon-title-format and/or frame-title-format to get what you
want.

(setq frame-title-format "%b") ought to do something useful for you,
but is untested.

I have added a bit to the functionality of fvwm2, both to the icon code 
and the menu code. I have written them as patches yet ;-) but if there's 
any interest then I'll get patches written and post them somewhere.

I haven't been subscribed to this news group for very long, so for all I 
know there could already be patches to do this. If there are, there is 
every chance that they will have been better put together than mine, 
since my X11 programming experience isn't great. But if not....

Basically I have added these new commands:
	
	*IconStyle flat | raised | sunk
	*IconColor foregroundcolor backgroundcolor

	*MenuTitleStyle forecolor backcolor font

What do the raised/sunk icons look like?  Do they work also with
MiniIcons?

Good morning,

	(Configuration:  fvwm95 v2.0.42a compiled, loved, and runs on
Sun Ultras, Sun Sparcs (SunOS, Solaris), SGI Indy and Indigos (Irix), IBM
RS6000s (AIX) and Pentiums (Slackware Linux).)

	This thing repeats with all configurations. Maybe I'm not getting
something right. What I'm trying to do is a generel rc file so that other
students can use it. I want it to have most of the settings in a single
location (so it is possible to update without users being aware), but that
would allow students configuration. Ideally, I'd want "Read
$HOME/.private" at the end of my file. This is a problem if I don't use
FvwmM4/FvwmCpp (And it's not very easy even if I do!). So far I've made a
little module called ReadFromHome which issues a home-relative Read
command to FVWM. I sure would like to see an environment-sensitive config
file. Nevermind. Here's the real problem, and it also happens when I use a
simple Read of FvwmCpp or FvwmM4:

	What happens is that fvwm behaves as if it forgot the
configuration files. For example: If I try to "Module FvwmTaskBar", it
comes up with totally different fonts, colors etc than the one I choosed
for it. Has anyone seen this thing? A known bug? A fault of mine? It's not
in the FAQ.

Thanks,

 _

All I have done for the raised/sunk icons is reversed the colours for the 
shadow and relief of the icon. The icons are for iconified windows, so 
specifying mini icons for icons will not do anything special. I'll grab a 
couple more screenshots and show you what I mean sometime today or 
tomorrow, and post them on the web URL given before.

Subject: FVWM: hooked on FONTics
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Can anyone help me with my system font problem? I'm running out of ideas.
I have 2 similar Win 95 machines, and one works while the other doesn't.

The one that doesn't work experiences font substitutions (usually boxes, but
sometimes Greek!) both in Wordpad, Wordperfect 6.1 for Windows, Microsoft
Word 7, and even on the minimized icons on the taskbar. It also has this
problem on line, not on an AOL page, but often on a web page. It also
experiences system failures (like GPFs).

After months of working on it, I reformatted (3 times so far) and checked for
the problem as I loaded each program.
I thought there might be a software conflict between the HP 680 printer
and/or wordprocessors, even tho my 2nd machine has no such problem. However,
the problem occurs right after Windows 95 itself is loaded, even without the
printer software or any other programs.

I've checked the system files of each machine, and tried mimicing the working
machine (system.ini was different RE:  TTfonts). I've tried comparing the
booklogs of both, but still no clues. I've tried replacing the fonts. It
didn't work before, but I'm planning on trying it again. I changed the
display settings, and even switched video cards (a Trident for a Cirrus
Logic), no luck. I tried Norton Utilities, it assures me there is no problem.
I've scandisked, speeddisked and reasoned with the disk, all to no avail. The
BIOS settings look similar, but I'm not sure whether anything about fonts is
relevant there.

Here are the only differences. I've set them up with the problem machines
first/good machine 2nd.  Processor AMD-K5 99 mhz/Cyrix 6x86 110mhz set at
133mhz; 
American Megatrends BIOS/ Award Bios, Trident 649x480 in 256 colors
video/640x480 in 256 Colors/ Matrox MGA Millennium 640x480 256 color;  1.51
gb hardrive/1.19 gbhard drive. Both use the same Win95, from CD Rom

Problem machine had some differences in TTInitialCache and TTFontDimenCache
in System.ini, but adjusting them didn't affect this problem.

Any suggestions would be greatly apreciated. Thanks to those who have made
suggestions before, I have tried them and tried to report back, but so far
nothing has worked.
Please e-mail suggestions to Chuck418@aol.com   Thanks for your time and
expertise.
Best,       Chuck  on 5/18/97

You'll actually want to set them both, most likely to be the same
thing :-)  Normally if you set frame-title-format and leave
icon-title-format unset, the icon title will follow the frame title.
However, there is at least one situation where the icon title will not
take if icon-title-format is not explicitly set:

I normally start emacs iconic and run a couple of functions from the
command line to build a set of frames for Gnus, the calendar and w3.
As part of my startup I set frame-title-format to
("%b (" mode-name ")")
which lets me separate certain emacs modes into different FvwmIconMan
managers (yes, I'm a geek with too much time on my hands).  Until I
explicitly set icon-title-format to the same thing, that initial
frame's icon kept the emacs@hostname title, even if I deiconified the
frame.  The icon name would change appropriately when the frame was
open, but if I iconified it again, it went back to emacs@hostname.

OpaqueMoveSize should do what you want, just give it the value of 100,
ie. stick the following in your .fvwm2rc.

OpaqueMoveSize 100

It's not a direct solution for your problem, but I use a program called
xcb which should be available from all X archives. They way it works is
the following:

1) With the mouse, I highlight any URL on the screen (mail, text files,
...)
2) I press on a button in my Wharf (I'm using wharf with fvwm) that executes
   the following script:

    #!/bin/sh

    url=`xcb -S 0 && xcb -p 0`;
    remotescape $url;

   xcb prints the current selection on stdout, where it is captured by the
   script and fed into this second script:

    #!/bin/sh
    if [ $1 ]; then
    netscape -noraise -remote openURL\("$1",new-window\) >/dev/null 2>&1 \
            || exec netscape "$1" &
    else
            echo "Usage: $0 URL"
            exit 0
    fi

   This second script starts a new netscape window with the selected URL.

It works like a charm, and I prefer its orthogonality over other `integrated'
approaches (in true UNIX style, this works with *every* application).

Cheers,
-Ives

Hi 
I saw this on the web:
"I hope to have the First Official 2.xx Version (it'll be 2.1.0) out "Real Soon
Now". It requires a little more polishing, like Doc updates,
Compile/Install procedure fixes, some more bugfixes, etc. "

And:

"Created: Jan 31, 1996 ----- Last Updated: Mar 27, 1997"

So how match more do you have to 'fix' things? vecks?  

I'm wonderig becouse I have problems installing 2.0.45 on solaris 2.4. It's when
i do make install then the compiler replays:

[private/tmp/egu/fvwm-2.0.45][202]:) make install
installing in ./libs...
install in . done
installing in ./fvwm...
install -c   fvwm2 /usr/datlib/bin
cp: /usr/datlib/bin: is a directory
install: cp /usr/datlib/bin fvwm2/bin failed 
*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `/usr/datlib/bin/fvwm2'
Current working directory /usr/datlib/private/tmp/egu/fvwm-2.0.45/fvwm
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'

way?


And this is after I have removed the misspelings, of button, in fvwm.c file.

Don't lose faith, fvwm2 should install quite easily.  In this case the
problem is the version of "install" that Solaris provides in /usr/sbin
and /etc.  You want to use "install" from /usr/ucb.

Change your path and try again.

(This should be in the FAQ, but I didn't find it.)

I've had exactly the same problem. The solution was to swap the order of
parameters given to the install command in the Makefile. See the manpage for
install for further information.

Hope this helps.

We have compiled and installed version 2.0.43 of FVWM.  This window
manager seems to do everything one could wish to configure.  This is
a great X-Window manager.  Congratulation and praises to the developer.

We have one just a couple of problems that you may have a solution for
or may have already fixed.

1. It seems that FVWM is performing some sort of key translation before
   it passes the key-code onto the application instead of giving the
   application the keyboard focus.  Basically I was unable to use the
   numeric keypad or any of the other keys that are next to the keypad
   (Pause, Page Up/Down, etc.) that the application required.  We
   put a print statement in the code to see what FVWM is sending.  The
   codes come out all right for the standard part of the keyboard except
   for these keys and some on the L-key pad on the left side.  Basicaly
   copy/paste/cut/undo/again keys on the left side (L-key pad) would not
   work like they do in CDE and OpenWindows.  Would like help in solving 
   this problem.

2. The FvwmBacker does not seem to function.  Here is the specification
   that I am using in the .fvwm2rc file.

   #*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid #aeb2c3
   #*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue
   #*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid midnightblue
   *FvwmBackerDesk 0 xv -quit -root /usr1/gort/dennis/tmp/WaterDrops.xpm

Stupid question: it's been a while since I've set up MH on my
Linux box, and I'm going to have to change my ISP settings
soon (I use fetchmail with IMAP to get things into my spool
file--I never got multidrop working properly with that program
--and have been using direct SMTP back to my ISP for outbound,
so that I've avoided diddling with sendmail settings).  But,
I can't figure out how exmh (MH) determines how to actually
send the mail!  I've looked through the MH book, the mh
directory, etc.  There's got to be a file someplace with
my ISP's SMTP server listed in it, but where?

hi folks,

i saw the recent post regarding FvwmBacker and since i had never tried
it before i fired up FvwmTalk to give it a try.

why is it that when i try to run it from FvwmTalk i get the errror 

     :FvwmBacker Version 2.0.45 should only be executed by fvwm!

i thought the whole purpose of FvwmTalk was to run things that fvwm
normally only wants to run...

Regards,

FVWM Folks;

I am having quite a bit of trouble installing FVWM 2.0.45 on Solaris
2.51.  I know it is not a problem with FVWM, but rather that Solaris is
broken...

Thanks to the user who previously pointed me to a rather useful site on
imake, which got it to build (apparently) successfully.  I now seem to
have a problem with LD.  It cannot locate libXext.so.1, so FVWM will not
run from my home direxctory where I built it, or from the /usr/local/bin.
If someone has successfullyt compiled this on Sol. 2.51, I would
appreciate some advice.  CDE & TWM are getting old real fast.

I started from an almost brand new Solaris installation ( I had already
compiled some GNU tools, but otherwise...)  and will be happy to summarize
my answers and submit a FVWM-on-Solaris howto, if there is interest.

Thanks

Using Fvwm you can bind an arbitrary key to perform some binding.  You
can specify this for the title bar, the frame, the buttons, the root
window, and the window contents itself.

For example, I have bound the "Front" key to do RaiseLower everywhere:

,-----
| # name          context modifier action   
| Key F15         A       A       RaiseLower
`-----

hth,

finally I have found out how to run fvwm properly from cde 8-))
(thanks to  Lars Sodergren)

first set you home session in Dtwm. that usually is an empty session, though
you could have the cde session manager remember what your desktop was like
instead of FvwmSaveDesk etc..

then you have to set two resources in .Xdefaults:

*wmStartupCommand: /home/orion/spxgm/bin/Fvwm
*waitWmTimeout: 1

in this case I run fvwm from a shell script so that library variables etc
are set properly for everyone.
the waitWmTimeout tells the seesion manager how long to wait until it starts
the window manager. I've set it to 1 second. by default it's 60 secs

finally you have to quit with

/usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession  (or whatever your path is for dtaction)


now you can happily use cde programs and fvwm.

Graeme

p.s. Chuck can you add this to the FAQ in the distribution

I have the following in my xinitrc:

twm &
xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &
xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &
xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &
exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login

If I am trying to call my fvwmrc file, what do I do, or where do I put the
command.  I tried deleting that section, then putting the full path to the
.fvwmrc file, but that got me nowhere.

As you probably inferred, this is my first attempt at setting up X, and am
having a hell of time getting this to work.

Thanks in advance,
Stu

fvwm is a window manager: you must run it instead of twm, so change the first 
line to "fvwm &", or more safely "(fvwm2 || fvwm || twm) &" or something.  
fvwm will automatically read .fvwmrc (fvwm2 will read .fvwm2rc, by default).

That may not do what you want.  The || will cause fvwm to run if
fvwm2 is not found, but will also run fvwm if fvwm2 exits with a
non-zero exit status.

If you know where the fvwm2 program is, another way to test for
its existance is

# or, sh code
if [ -r /the/path/to/fvwm2 ]; then
    fvwm2 &
elif [ -r /the/path/to/fvwm ]; then
    fvwm &
else
    twm &
fi

# csh code
if ( -r /the/path/to/fvwm2 ) then
    fvwm2 &
else if ( -r /the/path/to/fvwm ) then
    fvwm &
else
    twm &
endif

To everyone that has been helping, I thank you.  However, I still can't get
it to run.  Is there a way to specify the path to the .fvwm2rc file?  Does
that go in the xinit file?  More importantly, am I making this more
difficult that it needs to be?

Again, thanks for all the help.

I would first like to thank the people who created fvwm and the
contributors to its ongoing development as well as the people who answer
questions from people like me.
     I installed RedHat Linux version 4.1 Vanderbilt Kernal 2.0.  It
installed great, I then set the XF86Config file and started fvwm95.  It
worked great, however, one of the reasons I installed Linux was to get
away from Win95.  So I down loaded and installed fvwm2.0.45 I then went
to go change my .fvwmrc file to load fvwm2, however it was already set
to load fvwm and was loading fvwm95.  I chnaged it to fvwm2 and when I
type startx fvwm95 loads.  What I need to know is how to get fvwm to
load and not fvwm95.  As I am sure you can tell from my letter this is
my first shot at Linux and X Windows so any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm95 to fvwm2.0.4 standard

I would first like to thank the people who created fvwm and the
contributors to its ongoing development as well as the people who answer
questions from people like me.
     I installed RedHat Linux version 4.1 Vanderbilt Kernal 2.0.  It
installed great, I then set the XF86Config file and started fvwm95.  It
worked great, however, one of the reasons I installed Linux was to get
away from Win95.  So I down loaded and installed fvwm2.0.45 I then went
to go change my .fvwmrc file to load fvwm2, however it was already set
to load fvwm and was loading fvwm95.  I chnaged it to fvwm2 and when I
type startx fvwm95 loads.  What I need to know is how to get fvwm to
load and not fvwm95.  As I am sure you can tell from my letter this is
my first shot at Linux and X Windows so any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Ok, here are the errors I am getting when I do a startx from the command

have a .fvwm2rc in my home dir):

>>>> /usr/X11R6.3/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc: fvwm2: not found

Now, this message pops up real quick, kills out, then I get this error
message:

I have been pouring over the man pages, as well as several O'Reilly books,
and have yet to find the solution.  

Anyway, any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Nice Greetings to everyone.

Maybe someone can help me:

I take part in a Project that develops
a module for fvwm2 2.0.43.

This module has to heavily move and resize X-Windows.
The resize shall be done in several smaller steps 
(for optical reasons)
As the resize process takes much time
(at least too much for our ideas)
here's my question:

Is there a possibility to temporarily stop
X or fvwm from sending refresh messages to
windows (until the resize process has completed entirely)?

Of course I could patch fvwm, but maybe there's
a possibility without changing it.

Thank you very much for every hint.

Yours sincerely,
Armin Richter

On startup fvwm2 reads .fvwm2rc to determine its configuration. However,
you need to change the window manager that is started when X is
initiated.

The first thing to do is read the man page for startx, which reveals
that:

   To determine the client to run, startx first looks for a file called
   .xinitrc  in  the  user's  home directory.  If that is not found, it
   uses the file xinitrc in the xinit library  directory.

A quick find soon revealed the presence of /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc, a shell
script which does some setup with xrdb and xmodmap, then
looks for $HOME/.Xclients and execs it if it exists.

So you could create a .xinitrc or .Xclients with the clients you want
on X startup.

For example, your .Xclients could look like this:

    nxterm &
    emacs &
    xearth &
    fvwm2

The last client should be in the foreground, and is often the window
manager. When it finishes (you do Quit in fvwm2) the X session ends.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I've tried a couple of approaches which would come close to giving the
look and feel of what I'm looking for but so far I haven't even had
any luck getting those to work. 

The first thing I tried was to set up a style for the application 
(such as netscape) with NoIcon. This works great but I haven't been
able to find a function for de-iconifying except through WindowList.  
WindowId looks like it might be the function I need but I'm not sure 
how to figure out the window id.  

The other approach I've tried is to start the application during
startup with the -iconic switch and swallowing the result into a
button.  This resulted in a blank button and no action occurred when 
I clicked on the button.  

Any ideas on how to get one of these approaches to work?  Or is there
a different approach that works?

Thanks for any help or ideas,

Tim Ethen

Hi everyone.

First, I'll give you the symptoms of this rather unusual occurance
(which only happens every few hours).  Essentially, FvwmButtons (which
is swallowing FvwmIconBox) will disappear from my screen and dump
core in my home directory.  This seems to happen mostly when new
windows are popping up, but it has happened when nothing else was
going on.  The output of -debug is error-free, until the window
disappears, when I get...

  X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  4 (X_DestroyWindow)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x240000d
  Serial number of failed request:  10918
  Current serial number in output stream:  10919
  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62
  Resource id of failed request:  0x2000022
  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  74
  Resource id of failed request:  0x2000023
  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  66
  Resource id of failed request:  0x2000023
  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  66

  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)

  Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  62
  Resource id of failed request:  0x2000014

and on and on.  A slew of BadDrawable messages continues, with a new
set being generated whenever my focus switches windows.  And, more
mysteriously, a 'ps' shows that FvwmIconBox still exists, even though
it is nowhere to be seen.  If I kill the FvwmIconBox process, the
BadDrawable messages go away, at which point I can start a new
FvwmButtons (and thus a new FvwmIconBox) without difficulty.

Here are the relevant details -

	Fvwm2.0.45
	Solaris x86 2.5.1
	compiled with gcc 2.7.2 and Sun's X libraries
	  and version 3.4j of the XPM libs
	running under the Xsun X server
	16-bit color (65535 colors)
	1600x1200
	Matrox Millenium 4mb
	Pentium 200, 65Mb RAM

Fvwm compiled without difficulty.

Here's the portion of my .fvwm2rc dealing with both the buttonbar and
iconbox...

I'm really stumped on this one - any help will be greatly
appreciated.  By the way, a big thanks to the people who worked on
getting fvwm running as CDE's window manager.  And of course to the
developers - my fvwm desktop kicks my colleague's dtwm desktop's ass!
Woohoo!  :)

Thanks.

Can anyone think of a way to cause AutoRaise to not do anything while a
mouse button is pressed?

The situation: I go to select a menu on an application (say Netscape)
that is lowered.  Typically, I won't wait for the window to AutoRaise,
I'll just go for the menu.  The menu pops up, then the rest of the
window pops up over the menu a moment later.  I waste precious seconds
fiddling around with it to get the menu again.

Since AutoRaise can take a function argument, I thought of putting in a
function that would do "Nop" while a mouse button is pressed, and then
continue when the button was released.  So I could select my favorite
bookmark while Netscape was on the bottom of the stack, then have it
fronted as the page came in.   However, it looks like "while a mouse
button is pressed" is not a valid modifier. :-(

Any other way to do this?  Thanks for your suggestions.

	++Elmar

Hello there,

	I am trying to install fvwm-1.24r to see how it all works and I 
am running into a couple of errors which may either be symptomatic of a 
deeper, darker dilemma, or may, in fact, be simply my own incompetence.  
I am using a Sparc4 running solaris2.5.

	Following the installation script in README.Install I have 
managed the following:

xmkmf  - works without a hitch

make Makefiles  - every time it starts into a new directory I get the 
following message (this is specifically for the xpmroot directory):

+ make Makefiles 
making Makefiles in ./xpmroot...
rm -f xpmroot/Makefile.bak
+ mv xpmroot/Makefile xpmroot/Makefile.bak 
+ cd xpmroot 
+ imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/openwin/lib/config -DTOPDIR=../. 
-DCURDIR=./xpmroot 
"/usr/openwin/lib/config/site.def", line 30: macro UseInstalled redefines 
previous macro at "command line"

make all  - this is where things get catastrophic, below is the last few 
lines before total failure, but the previous many lines are identical in 
that the complaint is always language F not recognized.  The only thing 
different at the end is that it fails to make target icons.omaking all in 
./fvwm...
gcc -O -xF -DSYSV -DSVR4 -xF -Wa,-cg92   -I/usr/openwin/include  -DSVR4 
-DSYSV     -c  icons.c
gcc: language F not recognized
icons.c:27: X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `icons.o'
Current working directory /export/home/lewis/fvwm-1.24r/fvwm
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  I've used fvwm before and 
loved it, but never had to install it.

Thanks,

I use the following keybinding to go to my mail reading window.

I'm pretty sure this can be adapted to work with buttons and Netscape.

You might also want to try FvwmIconMan which is somewhat like
FvwmWinList but groks MiniIcons, too, and is in general much cooler
than FvwmWinList.

Have you got the XPM library installed?  If not, you might need to
fetch and install it.  You can probably get it from an x.org mirror.

The "language F not recognized" stems from the fact that your Imake
setup is tuned for the Sun C compiler but you use gcc.  "-xF" is a
meaningful switch for the Sun compiler but gcc thinks you're trying to
tell it about the language.  I think you can mostly ignore this message.

I solved the problem.  The Imake problem went away when I compiled on
another machine.  The _real_ problem, that fvwm could not exec went
away when I removed the ExecUseShell line from my .fvwm2rc!  Maybe
fvwm2 does not like tcsh, maybe my tcsh is slightly broken.  At least
I could see with ps that tcsh was being called with the right
command line, but it didn't seem to do anything.  OTOH, when I invoked
tcsh manually with the same command line it worked.  Yet Another AIX
Bug or a tcsh/fvwm2 bug?  I don't know, but now everything works
fine for me...

Hello everybody,

1. Our system administrator is maintaining a .fvwmrc for all the users who 
have links to that file. Thus, everyone has the same fvwm configuration which 
is automaticly apdated whenever needed. The problem is that I would like to 
have my own fvwm configuration, so I tried to create a .fvwmrc+ file in my 
home dir. But that doesn't work as it does for .bashrc+ and .emacsrc+ for 
example. Any tip to make fvwm take into account my .fvwmrc+ file ?

2. I am trying to configure my XFaces to make it "beep" when special mails 
arrive (My x terminal is not configured to play sounds, and a tip to make it 
produce sounds would be very appreciated). I used the "AfterCommandBindings" 
but that didn't work. I think I misused it, and the manual does not give much 
detail about that. So does any one know how to use the resources of XFaces, or 
how to make it run a command on a new mali?

	Here's what i put in my resources file :

XFaces.useCommand: True
XFaces.update: 30
XFaces.commandSearch: afterCommand
XFaces.afterCommandBindings: * "@" : xkbbell



We are using Fvwm Version 2.0.45 on SUN Ultra 1140 machines (Solaris). Most of 
users connect to these machines from their x terminals.

(Sorry for my English)

Thanks for any help

A while ago somebody on this list discussed a kind of "Re-Place"
function.  It should unmap a window and then place it a new place
using the CleverPlacement algorithm.  Was it ever written, and if yes,
is it a patch or can it be done within the .fvwm2rc?

I use version 2.0.45

Thanks for any help,

You should just call the file .fvwmrc for FVWM 1, or .fvwm2rc for
FVWM2, but it depends how it was compiled. But if placed in the your
home directory this should override the system file.

If this does not work you should try and find out from which file FVWM
is started. If you are using an X terminal it is probably a
.xsession file in your home directory, or a system .xsession file.
Somewhere in this file there will be a line something like 

/usr/local/bin/fvwm 1> $HOME/.fvwm-errs 2>&1 

that actually starts the window manager. If you modify it to 

/usr/local/bin/fvwm -f $HOME/.fvwmrc 1> $HOME/.fvwm-errs 2>&1

then it forces fvwm to read your config file. If it is a system
.xsession you will have to copy it to your home directory first.

(In case you were wondering the what the 1> $HOME/.fvwm-errs 2>&1 bit
is all about, it redirects all error mesages from fvwm to a file in
your home directory called .fvwm-errs. This is very useful when
experimenting with configurations and tracking down problems)

Can't help with this one I'm afraid. Sorry.

By the way, your English is fine. I wish my French was that good.

The function was written (not by me), and the patch was made to 2.0.44,
I believe.

When 2.0.45 came out WITHOUT the Replace function, I made the change
to 2.0.45, using the 2.0.44 patch as a road-map (it was actually very
easy to add).

However, I distinctly got the impression that Chuck didn't want to add
this function to fvwm, and I was told that the patch interfered with
other people's patches (ones that add new functions to fvwm).  So, I
reluctantly gave up on the patch, and it no longer is in my running
version of fvwm2.0.45.

Despite all this, I miss having the function.

assuming the system RC  file is named system.fvwmrc, try naming your file
.fvwmrc ... If not, you can try naming it .fvwm2rc ...

Thanks for everyone who tried to help, and sorry for being not clear. What I 
wanted is to keep the original .fvwmrc file, which is a link to the system rc 
file, and to define a .fvwmrc+ file, in which I can put my own preferences.

>From Martin's suggestion, i had a hint: I will try to call fvwm in this way :
fvwm -f "cat ~/.fvwmrc ~/.fvwmrc+"
I didn't try that yet, and I don't know what happens if there is conflicts 
within the rc and the rc+ files.

Thanks

Well, this probably won't work unless you copy the system default to your
home directory. Your best bet is to talk to the system administrator about
adding a line to the system fvwmrc that reads a users .fvwmrc+ file ...
Otherwise, just copy the system default file to your directory and modify
it to your liking.

Why not try the opposite:

Put at the beginning of your own .fvwm2?rc a call to Read the system
file.  Then add your modifications.  One of the best features in the
later releases of 2.0.XX is the Destroy* suite of commands that allow
you to get rid of any functions etc in the system file and replace
them with your own without conflict.  This way you can get the best
(from your perspective) of the system file and your own tastes.  I
suppose it's not all that efficient to load in the system file if
you're only going to destroy everything and rewrite it, but if it's
just one or two Decors or functions or module configs, it can be a
real win.

> Otherwise, just copy the system default file to your directory and

The disadvantage of this is that if the administrator changes the
system file the user will have to do more work if the user wants those
changes.  In practice, though, it probably works just as well.  I
doubt there are very many admins who make lots of changes to
system.fvwmrc.

Can anyone think of a way to cause AutoRaise to not do anything while a
mouse button is pressed?

The situation: I go to select a menu on an application (say Netscape)
that is lowered.  Typically, I won't wait for the window to AutoRaise,
I'll just go for the menu.  The menu pops up, then the rest of the
window pops up over the menu a moment later.  I waste precious seconds
fiddling around with it to get the menu again.

Since AutoRaise can take a function argument, I thought of putting in a
function that would do "Nop" while a mouse button is pressed, and then
continue when the button was released.  So I could select my favorite
bookmark while Netscape was on the bottom of the stack, then have it
fronted as the page came in.   However, it looks like "while a mouse
button is pressed" is not a valid modifier. :-(

Any other way to do this?  Thanks for your suggestions.

	++Elmar

This might be an old problem, but I haven't found anything in 
the FAQ... which is of great help.

When I start Netscape on my LINUX-Box (2.27, Redhat 4.1, fvwm2 as
window manager)  I get the Error Message: We were only able to allocate
12 cells for the color cube... although there are no other applications
running which could "consume" the colormap. Netscape runs but with messed
up colors.

I also tried the -install option (results in colormap flashing) and the
-ncols command line option of Netscape (no change).

Does this problem have anything to do with fvwm2?  How are colormaps
accessed anyway. Is this a general X-Windows problem? Is there any
possibility to extend the colormap, e.g. add entries and the like?  And
how in general are colors accessed under fvwm2/X-Windows, i.e.  what are
the differences to MS-Windows (where the problem doesn't occur)?

Thanks for any support.

hi folks,

i'm wondering how many of you use the tkgoodstuff instead of
FvwmButtons.  It seems to be a lot slower to do some things but some
features are quite nice (like the alarm clock).

Anyway, i guess this is sort of a poll with opions requested...

I wrote a quick and dirty little tcl/tk utility that displays a clock
and allows me to launch a mailer on a mouse click.  The script is easy
enough to modify to launch other applications or do other things based
on button clicks, etc.

The utility can be swallowed by FvwmButtons by using the following
line in you .fvwm2rc file:

*FvwmButtons(3x1, Swallow 'date.tk' 'Exec `$HOME/scripts/date.tk' &')

The '3x1' is due to the fact that I have a 'System Tray' portion of my
FvwmButtons that holds mini-icons for launching applications or tcl/tk
scripts.  This means that the clock is as wide as three mini-icons.

Note that I use FvwmM4; if you don't you can prolly get rid of the
backquotes in the line above.

One other thing:  using this script in a "System Tray," along with
binding a button to pop up a "Start Menu", and having FvwmButtons
swallowing FvwmIconMan, you can duplicate the functionality of the
Windows95 task bar quite well.

The date.tk script is small enough to enclose in this message.  Note
the procedures 'click1' and 'click3' show how to perform Fvwm actions
from tcl/tk without having to run as a Fvwm module (using FvwmCommand
that comes with fvwm-2.0.45 in the extras directory).  I use the
'insideClick' logic to allow the application to respond the same way
from single or multiple clicks.

date.tk follows (indented):

    #! /bin/sh
    #
    # *-tcl-* \
	exec wish4.2 $0 $*

    set insideClick 0
    global insideClick

    set font "-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"

    proc getTime {args} {
	set secs [clock seconds]
	.lab configure -text [clock format $secs -format "%I:%M %p"]
	after 10000 getTime
	update
    }

    proc click1 {} {
	global insideClick;

	if $insideClick return;

	set insideClick 1;

	exec FvwmCommand {warp-or-run "tkrat" Exec /usr/lar3ry/bin/tkrat}

	set insideClick 0;
    }

    proc click3 {} {
	global insideClick;

	if $insideClick return;

	set insideClick 1;

	exec FvwmCommand {Menu SystemMenu Nop}

	set insideClick 0;
    }

    label .lab -font $font -text "xx:xx" -bg #c0c0c0
    pack .lab -anchor c -fill both -expand yes
    bind .lab <Button-1> click1
    bind .lab <Button-3> click3
    getTime

    # end of date.tk script

I run the Xserver under xdm. 
In /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xserver I define
	
	:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -bpp 16

Netscape works now (thanks for the hint), however, FvwmBacker doesn't. 
In my .fvwm2rc file I define two desks:

	*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue
	*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -midnightblue

All what I get is a light green background on both desks. If I set the
background anew using: xsetroot -solid steelblue I can change the
colour to steelblue but when  I switch the desks I get the light green
colour again. 

Also the border I normally got when I tried to resize windows is gone. 

I thought I already run in a higher mode, because everything is
defined in my /etc/X11/XF86Config file (the Depth-line in the Screen
Section). Is this file read at all when using -bpp, or is the -bpp
16 option used as an alternative to the XF86Config?

Thanks for any clearifying support!

i noticed the same problem with FvwmBacker.  ie, using it as the
manual suggests does not work.

i had to call explicitly call xsetroot like this:

*FvwmBackerDesk 0 xsetroot -solid gray13
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 xsetroot -solid midnightblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 xsetroot -solid darkslategray

I'm quite partial to AfterStep's asclock - it runs standalone as well
as a module (I think i had to run it standalone with fvwm2, but it
works fine)

I use a program called xloadtime, it's a replacement for xload that puts a
digital clock inside the load meter.  Fewer processes and fewer resources than
a seperate program.  I hacked it to accept more resources and have a normal
12-hour clock.  It only works on Linux though, as each OS has a different way
of getting the load average.  If anyone knows how to get the load average
(other than popen("uptime","r") or some such kludge) on DigitalUNIX or SunOs
systems, let me know.

hi folks,

here's what i'd be super happy to have happen.  i'm using fvwm 2.0.45.

i'm trying to avoid tkgoodstuff because, to me, it seems like a huge
memory hog compared with FvwmButtons and also uses up a ton of cpu
cycles.  

anyway, i use xbiff to indicate new mail (any better ones out
there?).  i have FvwmButtons swallow xbiff.  i want to be able to
click on this as well and have it start vm in XEmacs 
(using gnudoit -q '(vm)'.  i can run the gnudoit part as a script,
that's not the problem.  the problem is convincing FvwmButtons that
this is a button.

i've tried this:  

*FvwmButtons(Swallow "xbiff" Exec '~/bin/vm.sh')

but Fvwm is not happy with it at all.

any solutions?

i'm posting this to the list so that others might be enlightened...

i wanted to be able to have FvwmButtons swallow xbiff but also to have
it act as a button that would run gnudoit -q '(vm)' (i'm an XEmacs
freak).  

well, this didn't seem possible except by making a small title which
was the actual button.  since the title was only about 1/5 of the
window this was hard to click on.

so, i decided to do what anyone would do, find a different biff to
use.  i found something called coolmail and, it's pretty damn cool.

it actually uses less memory than xbiff AND when you click on it, it
not only will execute a command (ie, gnudoit -q '(vm)') but does a
nifty animation.  

for those who might want to try this, here's the URL:

http://www2.pht.com/pht_archive/linux/sunsite/system/mail/biffs/coolmail-1.3.tgz

of course, any sunsite mirror will work...

Clicks on buttons that have swallowed an app are always passed to the
app.  But you can tell the button to have a title then specifying an
action means that you can click on the title to execute the action.
I did this and it worked.

IMHO FvwmButtons should not pass on mouse clicks if an action is
defined for that button.  Presumably the user knows what he is
doing....

Maybe in version 2.1 ?  Or maybe it is not that easy to "trick" X into
allowing that kind of stuff...

Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but I've tried to RTFM and
the FAQ and can't find the answer.  I'd like to get my icons to
behave the way they used to with mwm.  Basically, I want this:

  1. No icon box
  2. Specify where icons should go and in which direction they
     should "grow".

Specifically, I like the first icon to go in the top right corner
and have subsequent icons go to the left of that (i.e., I like the
icons to be at the top of the screen from right to left).  Is this
possible with fvwm?  If so, how?

How can I make tkGoodStuff to pop out one button, 
when I click the otherone, and vise-versa?

( I'm using it to mount-umount a cdrom)

Is there a way a button can be pressed and look 
pressed until I click it again?

If there is no way to do it, how can I *automaticly*
mount and unmount CD when I hit EJECT _on
my CD Drive itself_?  I tried eject command, but it doesn't 
seem to work (it doesn't umount/mount a CD)


TIA,
Nikita.


P.s.   Thanks to all who replyed on my emacs' backup files 
removal...

P.P.s.  I'm looking for sample GoodStuff and FVWM files.

to set me up.  Where do I get your porduct and what kinds of applications
should I exspect to run....again I'm a novice when it comes to X-Windows

Okay,

I am new here so don't blast me for asking a question that has probably
been asked a thousand times before.

Why does the rubber-band effect not work when using 16-bit color in FVMW2?

Thanks,
JR

Try the following in your .fvwm2rc:

Hope this helps,

This is in the manual but under the misleading heading of IconBox in
the Style commands. In my .fvwmrc I have the following as part of my
global style definition..

Style "*"      IconBox +0 +150 +200 +750

This specifies that all icons go in a region of the screen from 0,150
at top-left to 200,750 at bottom-right. However, despite being called
IconBox there is no box, this just defines an invisible boundary. The
icons fill up from left to right by default and as far as I know
there's no way to change this.

Style "*" IconBox l t r b

Specifies a region in which to place icons where l, t, r & b are numbers for the 
left, top, right & bottom coordinates of the region respectively.  Unfortunately 
the icons are placed from left to right and then top to bottom (like 
"*iconPlacement: left top" placement in mwm) and there is no way to change it.

The IconBox style could be changed such that l, t, r & b become x1, y1, x2 & y2 
and icon placement could begin at the corner specified by x1, y1 but it would 
need an extra parameter to tell it which way to go (vertical or horizontal).

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

  Hi all, I've been reading this list for a while now, and it's time
to send you my first question :)
- Does any of you knows about a way-cool buttons-like module WITH
kind of submenus ? I mean when you click on a button called, say Games,
then some buttons, say xtetris, xlander, and xvier, just appear over
the Games button; and they disappear if I click on the Games button
again. Er... popup mechanism might be better than 'submenus'... :)
I know Xf-Panel but that's not exactly what I'm looking for.
I do not like TkGoodStuff too much for some reasons even if I reckon
that this is a good one ;)
WHAT I WANT is a FvwmButtons just a little bit improved !! Thanks

Oh, I just think about another one (please god make that this is not
a FAQ ;) )
- I know that using the .fvwm2rc file, one can start applications on
whichever desktop he'd like... now, I have a 2x2 desktop, how can I
specify the quarter I'd like the application to start on ?
( If I deserve it, send me a RTFM ;) )

Thanks for any answer, Fabrice.

Good morning,

	Is there a way to redirect FVWM (95 for the matter) 's error
output so that it appears in a window? If I log on a console, I can use
xconsole. But I more often log from workstations.

One of my buttons is defined with the following action

Action  `Popup Rxvts`

The pop-up defined in my .fvwmrc is as follows

AddToMenu Rxvts		"Rxvts"*rxvt_but.xpm*		Title
+ 			"&QTerm"%x_mico.xpm%     	Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/qdigi.xpm

+			"&AlienTerm"%x_mico.xpm%	Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/alien01.xpm
-scale T -title "$HOST : AlienTerm" -n AlienTerm -geometry 80x25 &
+			"D&MTerm"%x_mico.xpm%		Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/dmlogo.xpm
-scale T -title "$HOST : DMTerm" -n DM -geometry 80x32 &
+			"&DeadTerm"%x_mico.xpm%		Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/dead01.xpm
-scale T -title "$HOST : DeadTerm" -n Deadlock -geometry 80x32 &
+			"&TestTerm"%x_mico.xpm%		Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/tcf.xpm -scale
T -title "$HOST : TestTerm" -n TestTerm -geometry 80x32 &
+			"&EliteTerm"%x_mico.xpm%	Exec
/home/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/Elite.xpm
-scale T -title "$HOST : EliteTerm" -n EliteTerm -geometry 80x32 &

(though obviously this has wrapped around a bit in the mail)

So when I click on the rxvt button a menu pops up. When I select an
rxvt or I click elsewhere it goes away again.

If you get rid of the text you can just have a menu full of pixmaps
which will look a lot like a button bar.

No, sorry. At the moment there is no StartsOnPage in the standard

is not possible.

Hi,

Please forgive me if this question has already been answered, I am quite
new to this list.

Could be usefull for fvwm newbies like me. Anyone willing to share his
nice and well documented .fvwm2rc file :-).

Now I don't mean to self publicise too much but 

http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/~imc/fvwm.htm

has a page which goes through my .fvwmrc giving screenshots etc.. 

It's not completely finished as Fvwm 2.0.45 came out as I was doing
it.. But for the newbie it should explain what most of the stuff
does.. I didn't get around to Modules yet either.. As for an archive
of .fvwm2rc's try some of the links from my page and the fvwm home
page...

I was recently in your shoes.  Unix will be a big change from wintel &
mac environments.  Unix (Linux for the pc) is a largely free operating
system (there are comercial flavors) designed to permit portability of
code.  XWindows is a graphical service provider for unix systems.  On top
of X, you need a window manager, which can range from very utilitarian
"the window manager" (the original) to very out-there "enlighten" (which
is provides large abilities to change the look of things radically) to the
painful "open look" (just plain yuck) to the ideal "fvwm" (stands for
f-virtual-window-manager), don't ask.  You will find that you can
customize the way you interface graphically with your computer nearly
completely.
Ennyhoo, a lot of this stuff is free, and the quality is really very good.
You can either buy cd-rom distros with all sorts of stuff on them (e.g.
infomagic cd sets, and several others) or download them (if you have a
fast connection or are patient).  A lot of usefull stuff will come with a
Slackware or RedHat linux distribution (sorry, i assume if you use
windows, you're looking at intelarch).  X is available at tsx-11.mit.edu
(though it really otta come with a cd-rom set), and there is MUCH free
good software at sunsite.unc.edu or one of its mirrors.  There are many
other places to get free stuff too, and you can set yourself up with
basically everything you need for free.
Get used to software that you can fix/change if it's broken or you don't
like it, support from real humans, and fast, powerful operation for a
change:)

By the way, I've fixed the default value for that for the next beta -
it will now calculate a good default (using the method recommended in
the OReilly Xlib programming manual).

Thanks to all about the hint for "Style IconBox".  I missed that
when I read the man page, probably because of the name (I don't
want an icon box).  However, I have two problems.  First, I can't
get it to work, and second, it doesn't really do what I want since
I want the icons to go from right to left.  I realize that there's
nothing I can do about the second problem (other than placing the
icons manually), so let this be an official request to add this in
a future release (if such a request is allowed on this list).

But I'd like to at least get the IconBox Style functionality to
work.  Here is the line I added to my .fvwm2rc file (this is cut
and pasted, so there are no typos):

Style "*"           IconBox +700 +0 -0 +200

I am defining a region in the upper right hand corner of the
screen for my icons.  I then restarted fvwm2 and iconified some
windows, but they didn't go in the upper right hand corner of the
screen.  I tried it with both existing windows as well as newly
created windows.  By default, the icons seem to go wherever the
mouse happens to be.  If I use the iconify button on the right
hand side of the titlebar, the icon goes where the top right
corner of the window used to be.  If I use Iconify from the menu
on the left of the titlebar, then the icon goes approximately
where the Iconify entry on the menu was on the screen.

One thing that would be helpful is if fvwm2 would at least force
icons to snap to a grid.  This way I could move them manually to
the top right corner of the screen and have them line up.

Sorry for such a lengthy message, and thanks for reading it if
you got this far.

One program I like is 'xsession'. Run it in foreground as the last client in
your X init file (.xinitrc, .xsession, or whatever) and it manages
your session, including startup of the window manager, e.g.:
  xsession -defaultWM fvwm2

This has a few benefits: it allows you to switch window manager on the
fly; if your WM fails (.fvwm2rc error, for example) you still get
your X clients and can switch into another WM (say twm) while you
fix the problem; it has a text pane that shows error messages, including
those from the WM.

It's probably at somewhere like ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/contrib/applications/
or your local X mirror.

Hello,

First, I would like to thank everyone who gave hints on how to have my own 
.fvwmrc while keeping the link our administrator put in everyone's home dir.

what i finally did is the following. I created my own .fvwmrc+ file where I 
put my own preferences. Then in my .xinitrc I put this line:

fvwm -f .fvwmrc.sys -f .fvwmrc+

where .fvwmrc.sys is previously generated using "awk" :

awk '....' .fvwmrc  > .fvwmrc.sys

(.fvwmrc is the file maintained by the administrator)
Thus, I still have my fvwm automatically updated while having my own 
preferences.

Thanks again.

Yes! This is what I was looking for. I should have remembered "tail -f".

fvwm2 is not understanding "-0".  This works:

Style "*"           IconBox +700 +0 -1 +200

If fvwm2 doesn't understand the "style iconbox" it  just acts like the
iconbox is full and does what you describe.

Usually with  fvwm2, if you want more  complex behavior,  the standard
answer is "use a module".  The built-in behaviors are typically pretty
basic.  Thats  not to say that  there is a module  that does  what you
want, I don't think there is, but there probably could be...

Hi Guys,



I've been using fvwm for some time, but I haven't been watching the updates
all that closely,

although I am now using 2.0.45. The problem that I've got is with Lotus
Notes, which tries

to remember where I placed the windows, and how big they were, and then
tries to recreate

my session when it restarts.



The problem is that it get's it wrong!



The windows slowly move (ie: each time a window is opened, it's position
and size is a little different)

to the bottom right corner (this has no relationship to the automatic

window placement from fvwm), and they get larger and larger, to the point
where they no longer

fit on the screen. This means that I constantly have to resize and position
these damn popup

windows from Lotus Notes.



Is it possible that fvwm is giving lotus notes geometry information with
size of the window

frames included, and then using the geometry from Lotus Notes to position
the actual

window (without frames)? Does anyone have a sollution to this problem? a
patch perhaps?



For some reason the people using mwm here don't seem to have this problem.



Thanks in advance,



Steve

One method I've used in the past is to do something like this:

AddToMenu "DiskOps" "Disk Operations" Title
+     "Mount CD" Exec exec su -c "mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/hdd /cdrom"
+     "Unmount CD" Exec exec su -c "umount /cdrom ; xcdeject"

NOTE: Don't do this exactly this way. Use sudo, or use a mount that
understands "user" in fstab. xcdeject is something I found somewhere
on the net; try a search. Using su like this relies on root having no
password, which is extremely evil.

Or, you could try using the automounter in
http://sunsite.unc.edu/system/misc/mount

although I have no experience with it.

Hello,



I had a neat idea, but it's been blown to hell due to implementation
problems.

I'm trying to make an application which automatically iconifies itself (in
fact, it

just shrinks the window, and moves itself to a predeturmined corner
somewhere)

when the application no longer has the focus, and automatically grows to
full

size again when the application gets the focus. This would be a neat
feature

to add to the windowlist for example!



Anyway, the problems I'm having are that the focus events get repeated (4
times

for each real FocusIn/FocusOut event), which causes the shrink event to get
called

4 times instead of once, and likewise the grow callback. If the user
decides to move the

window by dragging the title bar for example, then the focus is taken away
from the

application too - which with this example produces truly entertaining,
albeit useless, results.



On top of that, the geometry information doesn't seem to match up properly,
by asking

for and storing the current geometry before shrinking or growing, and then
re-using

the values that fvwm gives back, the window's geometry moves slowly to the
top left corner

of the screen.



To make it all a little more mysterious, these problems only happen on
fvwm. I tested the

program under mwm and it worked fine (although the resising bit didn't
quite work as expected.)



Any ideas?

Is there a way to "optimise" X events (preferably from fvwm directly)?

Has anyone else tried making a toy like this before?



Thanks in advance,



Steve

I just checked out the official WWW page for fvwm, and the

latest comments are from March - is fvwm still being actively

developed? What sort of things are coming? What's on the bug list?

(the bug list delivered with 2.0.45 is pretty short :-)



Thanks in advance,

Lets call it  a  bug.  Heres a  lightly  tested patch that   fixes it.
Apply it in the fvwm sub-directory.  (The line  numbers could be off a
bit, I do have a few other patches applied.)

Yes, it is.  It's just that I have been extremely busy lately and
haven't been able to do much work on it, plus I have been so quiet on
the mailing lists that one might assume that I'm dead or something
(but never fear, if that happens I'll be sure to make an anouncement).

I hope to get the next beta out within a few weeks, but I've been
saying that for months now... (wow, has it really been since January?)

SR> What sort of things are coming? What's on the bug list? (the bug

Too much stuff to put here (same answer for both questions, I think). :)

If you are referring to the BUGS file, that isn't even close to all of
the bugs (I haven't really kept up that file).  The TO-DO list is a
better list, and does document some more bugs, although it too is a
little out of date.

The mailing list archives and the list that stays in my head are
probably the two best bug (& TO-DO) lists, the former being archived
on the official WWW page but getting at the one in my head is
obviously difficult until I get around to using it to update the
actual BUGS and TO-DO lists. :)

Nice Greetings to everyone.

Maybe someone can help me:

I take part in a Project that develops
a module for fvwm2 2.0.43.

This module has to heavily move and resize windows.
In fact, several windows simultaniously
The resize shall be done in several smaller steps 
(for outlook reasons)
As the resize process takes much time
(at least too much for the project's needs)
here's my question:

Is there a possibility to temporarily stop
X or fvwm from sending refresh messages to
windows (until the resize process has completed entirely)?
To make it clear: the resizing and moving is done by the module,
not by hand, so switching OpaqueResize doesn't change anything.

Of course I could patch fvwm, but maybe there's
a possibility without changing it.

I tried to temporarily disable XMapWindow in events.c:

	default:
	  if (Tmp_win->Desk == Scr.CurrentDesk)
	    {
/*	      XMapWindow(dpy, Tmp_win->w);*/
/* This should at least keep the borders been redrawn, but in fact it*/
/* doesn't. Any comments? */

	      XMapWindow(dpy, Tmp_win->frame);
	      Tmp_win->flags |= MAP_PENDING;
	      SetMapStateProp(Tmp_win, NormalState);
	      if((Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus)&&
		 ((!Scr.Focus)||(Scr.Focus->flags & ClickToFocus)))
		{
		  SetFocus(Tmp_win->w,Tmp_win,1);
		}
	    }
	  else
	    {
/*	      XMapWindow(dpy, Tmp_win->w);*/
	      SetMapStateProp(Tmp_win, NormalState);
	    }
	  break;

But that disables nearly everything.
The borders should be redrawn as always, however, the client's windows
shall only be moved, not resized, as long as the window has not
reached its final destination.

Thank you very much for every hint.

Yours sincerely,
Armin Richter

Do someone know where I can find this library? I will really be appreciate 
Any help. One of the programs is fvwm95.

ooops! Sorry everyone. Some of my pages were created on my PC at home
using Windows stuff so they end in a 3 letter extension. Some of them
don't. When I get a moment I'll sort them all out..

Hi,

I am still using fvwm v1.22r. I tried out fvwm2 a while ago and I didn't
find a way to do what I have gotten used to very much. I want my sticky
windows and their icons to be in a different color. In fvwm2, the windows
were showing up with stripes and the icons were like any other icons. Has
fvwm2 changed recently to let me get v1 behavior?

The second thing I wanted to ask was if I could rearrange icons. Sometimes
the icons get spread all over and I want to arrange icons. In v1, there is
no way to do that (at least I don't know of any way).

Regards,

Did anyone get an answer to how to make FvwmButtons swallow an iconified 
application??? 
 
I'd like to swallow rclock iconified so that it will display the clock as well 
as the date. 
 
Thanks,

Currently it can't.  At one point it was on the FvwmButtons todo list,
but the FvwmButtons home page seems to no longer exist.  If Jarl is
still reading this, perhaps he can help.

You can have FvwmButtons swallow an instance of FvwmIconBox that only
displays the icon you want.  This is pretty ugly, but it does work.

Hi... I hope I'm not told to RTFM here, cuz I've read the FAQ and the man
pages on the FVWM HomePage (Mr Hines') and couldn't find the answer...
maybe there isn't one, necessarily... ANYWAY!
I'm sorta new to Linux, but I do know my way around, and have almost
configured fvwm 1.xx to my liking.  I downloaded 2.0.45 and want to install
it.  However, I'm not too sure how to go about this... would I put the
fvwm-2.0.45 dir in the same dir that the fvwm dir is in (/usr/X11R6/) or
what?  I'm just looking for someone to offer advice on the best way to get
fvwm2.0.45 installed and running.

Thanks...

Well, the easiest thing to do is this (I'm starting with the tar.gz file)
.. Unarchive it in some directory (I like /usr/local/src) and go into the
fvwm-2.0.45 directory. Edit the config.tmpl (or whatever the configuration
template is called, don't worry, it should be obvious) to your likings,   
and then save it. Type ./MakeMakefiles ... This will make the makefiles   
prior to building the sources. Then type "make" ... This will make all the
binaries, etc... Then type "make install" ... this will install all the   
binaries and things into the default locations (or whatever you
specified in the configuration template). then it's either "make
install.man" or "make install-man" (I forget which) to install the man    
pages. This should be it. Enjoy! :)

Hello,

I have the following in my .fvwmrc 

*FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld,NoClose) "xclock" `Exec xclock -title xclock -bg rgb:90/80/90 -geometry 98x98-256-2 &`)

if you just change xclock by rclock and some parameters, it should work.

I needed to do this because we use a mail program called 'Mailworks', which when
iconified shows you a dog with mail in its mouth if you get new mail (!!??!!).
The only way I could think to do it is to use an FvwmIconBox. I swallow this in
my FvwmButtons and ensure that only the one icon I want is present in the
icon box. Here's what I used (fvwm 2.0.45):

  For my button bar:

     *IconBar(Frame 0, Swallow(Respawn) "IMailBox" "IMailBox")

  For my FvwmIconBox (called IMailBox ie I have a soft link from IMailBox to
  FvwmIconBox):

     *IMailBox "nedit*" -

and styles:

     Style "*"                       Icon xterm.xpm
     Style "MailWorks*Browser*"      NoIcon
     Style "nedit"                   NoIcon

nedit and mailworks are the only two apps I have in iconbox's. I disclude the nedit
ones from my IMailBox and the mailworks ones from the other to ensure I don't
have duplicates.

Now when I double click on the icon (in the button bar) the icon remains iconified
but the window expands - so I have the icon and the window. I only ever start the
program once (done in a seperate script - but this could be done within a function
or something).

I suppose you could use "*" to disclude all icons and then add a specific one
(rclock).

Hope this helps,

Gary Sargent.

You begin with Linux by buying a `distribution', basically the OS
kernel bundled with applications.  I think Red Hat is a good
distribution and I know that Debian is good (use it myself).

Fvwm is just one program among many.  Beginning to use Linux because
of Fvwm is similar to deciding to switch from MacOS to Win95 (say)
because of the File Manager in Win95.  You will probably get Fvwm with
your Linux distribution, but it might be an old version and you could
go to the Fvwm web site (look at the bottom of this message) to fetch
the newest version.  Fvwm is labeled beta but it is very stable
(hasn't crashed for me once!).

Hi everybody and thanks for your answers, I now have a working fvwm2
configuration.

A few remaining problems :

I have FvwmIconMan running, swallowed by FvwmButtons, set to display
the icons in my page. When I start Fvwm, I load netscape in one of the
pages. When I start FrameMaker thereafter, it complains about colormap
allocation even though I have set ColormapFocus FollowsMouse. The
strange thing is that this makes all icons in FvwmIconMan disappear ?

When I restart Fvwm, I can't get my pager to be swallowed by
FvwmButtons, and I'm getting X errors BAdDrawable and BadWindow.

I am trying to have the name of the file being edited in Emacs show up
in the title bar. I have done a (setq frame-title-format '("%b")) in my
.emacsrc, which should do the trick, but doesn't. I have checked the
emacs documentation and it says something like "if window manager
supports it". Has somebody done that successfully with fvwm2 ?

Thanks

Herve

You need to run 'netscape -install' to get its own colourmap (but with
colourmap flashing) or 'netscape -ncols x' to allocate x colours, where
x is small.

Does this just happen when you switch pages or desks? If so it's not
a colourmap problem.

I do this, and it works fine in just about every window manager I've tried:

(setq frame-title-format '("" user-login-name "@" system-name ": " "%b"))
(setq icon-title-format  '("" user-login-name "@" system-name ": " "%b"))

Subject: FVWM: small color pixmaps
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

Here are six small color pixmaps that
I use on my FvwmButtons. They all span
30 pixels wide and 30 or less pixels
high. Most of these were snarfed and
sized via XV then hand edited to clean
them up.

I hope this is the right place to send
this. No flames, please, but if there
is a better place to send these, let me
know. Also, if anyone has an ftp site that
has a collection of small pixmaps, I would
appreciate knowing where that is.

I am trying to compile fvwm 2.0.45 and 2.0.44 on a AIX 4.1 machine.  
I am getting the following error.

[ena2] </home/users/paulb/fvwm-2.0.44>xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
"./Fvwm.tmpl", line 439.27: 1506-234 (W) Expecting a newline

(E) Too many arguments specified for macro NamedTargetSubdirs. [ena2] 
</home/users/paulb/fvwm-2.0.44>

I have tried compiling it on four of the AIX machines around here, 
but two of them, 3.2s,  do not have xmkmf on it.  It could be that 
both of the 4.1 machines were not setup properly and that could be 
causing the error.  
Thanks for your help.

I have had a go with this patch. Animated menus and animated move are great, I 
vote they go in.

But the patch didn't apply very nicely on my HP-UX 10.20 box.  It seems to have 
too many changes for just one patch.  There is a change to configure.h (the 
DEBUG #define with variable arguments) causes compiler warnings (I don't use 
gcc).  Debug is also turned on by this patch.  Setenv should be in a sperate
patch.  The gperf stuff does not rebuild if you edit functions.c to add a new 
command.

Something is also translating parts of my .fvwm2rc to lowercase.  This stops 
FvwmBanner and FvwmButtons being run at startup from the following

AddToFunc InitFunction	"I" my_resources
+			"I" FvwmBanner
+			"I" Wait FvwmBanner
+			"I" FvwmButtons FrontPanel
+			"I" Wait FrontPanel
+			"I" my_topwindow


What is strange is that the following function (bound to a key works)

AddToFunc my_test	"I" Next [FvwmTalk] my_focus
+			"I" None [FvwmTalk] FvwmTalk
+			"I" Wait FvwmTalk
+			"I" my_test

I've tried to find where this is happening but the patch is huge!
Would it be possible for you to do a minimal patch that justs adds animated
menus and moves?

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

I've also noticed that the gperf stuff doesn't erase the file before
creating it.  It appends another copy to the end.  On my second make
I get redefinition errors because of it and have to truncate the
file.

It has some problems with the DEC Alpha stuff too, but you can ignore
the DBUG stuff (even says so in the comments).

I noticed that there was a type conflict on a function return but cannot
remember where right now.  Easy fix.

I was able to reproduce this.  At work I normally build under AIX
3.2.5, which doesn't show these problems, but all of our machines are
being upgraded to AIX 4.1, so this would have hit me eventually...

Try this patch, which I don't think will affect anyone in a bad way,
but can't check another OS (eg Linux) until I get home tonight:

Thanks for the patch.  I am having trouble applying it though.  Patch 
keeps telling me that it can't find the patch, even if I past it into 
standard in.  
 
If I am in ../fvwm-2.0.45 I run
patch -p 0 < patchfile

correct?  i have tried various versions of being inthe directory, or 
out of it, with -p 1,0, etc.
 
Any ides?  
 
Thanks.

Dear fvwm users,

I would like to install fvwm-2.045 but when I have tried:
1. xmkmf (seems O.K.)
2. make Makefiles (or ./MakeMakefiles) gives the following;
Makefile:745:***missing 'endef' unterminated 'define' Stop

I have Slackware3.1, kernel-2.0.0, Pentium 16Ram.

Thanks in advance,
Please answer to 'krupa@alpha.sggw.waw.pl'

Hi.

I'm using Fvwm Version 2.0.45 for months now and I'm very happy. In fact
it's the best window manager I ever used.

I compiled a new version of xcoral for the first time (xcoral-3.1, got
it from ftp.x.org (contrib/editors)).

I compiled it on the same SUNOS 4.1.4 box I used to compile fvwm2 and
when I start xcoral, fvwm2 crashes :-(

I tried to run the same application with olwm (SUN's Open Look Window
Manager) and it worked with no problem.

Attached a stack trace from the core file.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Yehuda.
