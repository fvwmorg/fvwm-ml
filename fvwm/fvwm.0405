Hello,

I have tried to configure fvwm so that it behaves the same as other 
window-manager on resizing and moving: When pressing ALT, clicking into 
a window with the left mousebutton should move the window, clicking the 
right mousebutton should grep the nearest edge (or border, what I had to 
add to the shellscript) of the window and do a resize.

Below you see the configuration for this. The attached script (that 
certainly has to be executable and stored in the search path; it 
probably requires bash.) calculates the nearest corner and prints out 
the statement to move the mouse cursor to it.

Moving works fine. On resizing the problem is that you have to release 
the right mousebutton before resizing is started. Is there a way to 
change this behaviour to directly starting the resizing on mouse press?

(I have started this experiments some months ago, but did not find the 
time to work on it for longer now)

Thank you,

Gert

So,

Should I infer from the silence that there is no way to do this, or that

Reply to the fvwm list, not to me.

You might get a better response if you
put your reply BELOW the portion of the quoted text you are
replying to.

Look at fvwm-menu-desktop

You can't expect someone on the list to do all the work.
You haven't shown us what is in the mail you got from Stefan.
All you've said is "write a patch".  A patch to do what?

Probably the right guess would be that people who know didn't have a time
yet to read the question or to compose a good answer. I for one was not
even online yesterday when you asked. Be patient.

I don't think icewm supports the fvwm-module-protocol with all recent
enhancements, so this is impossible.

I think your approach of getting certain applications and composing them
together to get a WinXP like desktop can't be successful unless you
become expert in these applications and know to at least configure them.
Probably some skills in unix, X, packaging and art are required too.

You wrote you want to use icewm because you need good root menu entries.
This seems like a poor reason to choose a window manager.

Menus in fvwm are very configurable (content, look and feel). I suggest
to read documentation on fvwm.org (man pages, screenshots, configs).

P.S. Please ask the list, not me privately. Maybe someone else may help
to your project better than this. I can't.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I just tried 2.5.x and 2.4.x and these behave equivally regarding this
feature. With ClickToFocus policy, Close alone works even better than you
want. I.e. if you close the focused window, the previously focused window
on the same desk gets the focus (not just any random window).

If you use MouseFocus this does quite not work, since you just get the
window under the pointer (or no window) focused. This is what MouseFocus
is all about.

And with SloppyFocus, Close works agian like you want, you either get the
previously focused window or a window under the pointer.

Please describe again what is your desired behaviour and what is your   
focus policy for windows. Try Close alone, it works for me.

Use SloppyFocus instead of MouseFocus if this is what you want.

As for your Next command question, try this command:

  Prev (CurrentDesk, !Sticky) Focus

Take a look at FvwmEvent module, it does what you want.

Just don't use both methods simultaneously, chose either "smart" close
button, or "smart" close event.

Mikhael et al,

Thanks for the response.  I appologize for my earlier impatience.

I use MouseFocus.

I want more than just the Focus; I want the desk to switch automatically
to the newly focused window.  The Focus function will do this (and even
move the mouse over the top left corner of the window; perhaps a
consequence of MouseFocus), but the SloppyFocus feature will not.

This is good.  Is there any way to have it execute some statement if there
is no window on the CurrentDesk which is not Sticky?  Specifically, can I
tell fvwm to try to focus one on the current desk, and only if there is no
window on the CurrentDesk, focus one on /any/ desk?

A small side note. I would divide the window into 9 squares and not 4,
and warp to the 8 corresponding points on the border. In 90% of cases I
only need/want to resize one direction, not two. And if I need both
directions then I probably want Maximize anyway. So probably 4 triangles
(with only side center border points) would be good for me too.

Replace all "I" with "H":

  DestroyFunc MyResize
  AddToFunc MyResize
  + H StoreMousePos
  + H WarpToNearestEdge
  + H Resize
  + H RecallMousePos

Then it works like you want with a small click-time delay, about 0.15
seconds. You may like this delay, otherwise add one more wrapper function:

  DestroyFunc MyResize0
  AddToFunc MyResize0
  + I ClickTime 0
  + I MyResize
  + I ClickTime 150

Mikhael.

These side effects of the Focus command work regardless of the focus
policy. You may read about this command and its argument. There are a lot
of other good things in the man page.

If you want something else than just focus with page change (not desk
change if you work on the same desk), then create a function, like:

  DestroyFunc MySwitchToWindow
  AddToFunc   MySwitchToWindow
  + I Iconify off
  + I Focus    # or FlipFocus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 10p 10p

There is TestRc command in 2.5.x that basically implements the "else"
statement for conditional commands like Next.

There is a way to implement a similar if-else construction in 2.4.x too,
using a temporary function that you create in the condition (and before
it), and then execute such function. But I would rather suggest to use
2.5.10 than such hack.

Mikhael.

I don't think that 2.5.10 is any different here.

There is actually option that disables this square, DrawIcons.

I can't reproduce your situation. I either always get the
iconified-window square or never.

Post your whole FvwmIconMan config. (Please use *FvwmIconMan: option
syntax that worked in 2.4.x too.)

SelectOnRelease accepts only one key parameter, at least accourding to
the man page.

I thought that configuring the right Alt to generate the same keysym
(i.e. Alt_L and Meta_L on my system using this command:

  % xmodmap -e 'keycode 113 = 0xffe9 0xffe7'

) should make the right Alt select on release for Alt-Tab. But it seems
that only the first matching key (the left Tab) is used.

So, I think, the answer is "no".

Accourding to the man page, NoCurrentDeskTitle option does this.

There is no "OnlyUseListSkip", but "OnlyListSkip".

This affects the windows that are configured like:

  Style FvwmPager WindowListSkip

>From the man page:

  OnlyListSkip option [...] causes WindowList to only consider the
  windows with WindowListSkip style.

Correspondingly, UseListSkip (that is the default) skips such windows
from the list. So, the pager from our example is not listed by default.

Yes, if you configure MiniIcon style option for some (all) windows, then
these mini icons are used automatically:

  Style XTerm MiniIcon xterm.xpm

I don't think this is currently possible. Just lock your mouse
physically. :)

> A small side note. I would divide the window into 9 squares and not 4,

Yes, you are right. I have planned to do this, but did not enhance the 
script yet, because the whole behaviour was very useless for me... until 
now.

Thank you very much for your hints. They are working great. Now I can 
start using fvwm for real ;)

> Replace all "I" with "H":

I have read this part of the man page several times. But did not 
understand the resulting behaviour for H instead of I.

> Then it works like you want with a small click-time delay, about 0.15
> seconds. You may like this delay, otherwise add one more wrapper function:

No, I do not like the delay, so I am using the following wrapper 
function. (hmm, as I am writing this mail I ask myself if it is possible 
to include the clicktime-lines in MyResize without another wrapper 
function? I will test this)

>   DestroyFunc MyResize0
>   AddToFunc MyResize0
>   + I ClickTime 0
>   + I MyResize
>   + I ClickTime 150

In the last line the "150" can be omitted. This will switch back to the 
default.

What do you think of my solution conceptionally? Is this the right way 
to solve this or are there better ways?

Thank you again,

Gert

PS: Is there a collection of such configuration snippets somewhere where 
I can "publish" my solution? I think there might be others who are 
interested in such a resize-behaviour, too.

I hope you understand that "H" means holding the mouse as opposed to "C",
"M", "D" and "I", it is activated after ClickTime milliseconds.

Now, Resize operation is normally started by a mouse press. Exception is
"M" and "H", then Resize does not require an initial press, sinse we are
in the dragging mode already. This is from my experience only, it is
possible there are additional nuances (2.4.x may be different here).

Don't do this. This ClickTime affects the whole function execution,
so changing it in the same function may work if it is done using "I",
but it may as well fail or work strangely. The actual behaviour is not
defined well and may stop working in the future. Use a wrapper function.

The "better" way is to patch move_resize.c to allow another resize option.

Mikhael.

Is it possible to get behavior similar to CurrentAtEnd without using
WindowList?

I prefer to use M-tab to switch between the most recently used windows
(usually on the order of 3-4) while still being able to switch to any;
however, I would like to avoid using WindowList because I tend to have a
lot of windows open in a single viewport, causing the menu rendering to
be very slow (even with the default settings and a bitmap font)--in
fact, sometimes my key release event is lost!

Basically, FlipFocus isn't really what I want (because it will always
flip between two windows), although it's close--if I could cause the
flipping to happen only after I released the meta key, I think FlipFocus
would be exactly what I want.  Focus isn't desirable because it always
goes forward through the window list from the current position.

Any ideas/neat hacks?  Ideas to speed up WindowList would interest me as
well, although I suspect the problem is part UTF-8 locale and part
gigantic window list (I've ended up with over 91 windows in a single
viewport.)

I always thought "I" means "immediately" after mouse press (the man page 
says "is executed as soon as the function is invoked". This seems not to 
be true, is it?).

Well, it works in 2.5.10. The first command is "+ I ClickTime 0" all the 
other commans "+ H ...", including the "+ H Clicktime" as the last 
command. I think this is a defined behaviour. But ok, if it is more safe 
I will use a wrapper-function.

 > The "better" way is to patch move_resize.c to allow another resize 
option.

I did take a look to this C-function, but because I do not know anything 
about the fvwm-code (which global variables do exist, where do I get the 
parameters from, which function is to be called for some functionality, 
etc.) and because I cannot find enough time, I have to wait until 
someone else will implement this. ;|

If I implemented it I had chosen a 3x3-field as you mentioned. Because 
one might only want to resize a window at the border I had created two 
parameters: "Resize NearestEdge NearestCorner". The first one only 
allows to grab an edge for resizing the window in only one direction.

But let's wait if and when someone will do this and how.

Ciao,

Gert

"I" does work immediately.

I just played with it a bit and my previous explanation was not fully
correct. It is not Resize that requires mouse release with "I", but a
combination of PipeRead printing WarpToWindow. This currently only
supports dragging with "M" and "H", but not with "I".

Here are 3 examples doing the same thing, to demonstrate the problem:

  Mouse 3 WTSF M MyResize

  DestroyFunc MyResize
  AddToFunc MyResize
  + I WarpToWindow 100 100
  + I Resize

This first example works like you want. But the following second example
requires mouse release (and then Resize requires mouse click, since we
are not dragging anymore):

  DestroyFunc MyResize
  AddToFunc MyResize
  + I PipeRead `echo WarpToWindow 100 100`
  + I Resize

Seems like a bug, because the following works without additional mouse
release and click:

  DestroyFunc MyResize
  AddToFunc MyResize
  + I PipeRead `echo Echo just to have some command executed`
  + I WarpToWindow 100 100
  + I Resize

I think this should be fixed, but let's wait for the Dominik's reply.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

I came across this article recently which explains some of the
reasons why the Macintosh window-manager is so much more intuitive &
user-friendly compared to the Windows window-manager.

I thought some people here might find this an interesting read:

For fvwm2-2.2.5-4, the following simple setup in my .fvwm2rc

AddToDecor default
+ ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)
+ ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- flat
+ ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap close.xpm -- flat
+ ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap iconize.xpm -- flat
+ Buttonstyle 6 Pixmap up.xpm -- flat
+ TitleStyle LeftJustified height 20 -- flat
+ BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset

gave a look where the titlebar and the buttons were all flattened and there 
was no any sort of relief or border between the titlebar, buttons, the 
frame and the sidebars.  However, there was a pronounced relief between the 
sidebars/titlebar/frames and the application within the window.

Some time ago, I switched to fvwm-2.4.15, and the same setup gives me a 
look where everything is flattened, there's no relief on the outer and 
inner sides of the sidebars/frames, etc.  It looks really ugly.  I removed 
"NoInset" so there is a relief between the sidebars/frames and the 
application within the window, but now the titlebar and the buttons all 
look "sunk".  Basically, I would like to keep them flat, but not have any 
sort of relief between them and the upper sidebar/frames.  I have the 
feeling that this must be really simple to do.  But how?

Also, somebody mentioned "NoCurrentDeskTitle" removes the Desk name from 
WindowList.  Is that new?  It does not work with 2.4.15.

Cheers,
Greg

Indeed.  However, the mistake he seems to make is the assumption that
speed is everything.  It isn't.

Personally, I have, detest and despise the Mac single-fixed-menubar
model with a consuming passion.  I want each application I have open to
own its own menubar, dammit.

Yes, Apple put lots of work into human interface design.  And the Mac
interace works great ...   IF IT WORKS FOR YOU.  If it DOESN'T work for
you, it's a steaming, fetid pile of rancid dingos' kidneys.  One size
does not fit all.

Though I generally opt for command line interfaces, especially due to 
lackings I find in GUIs, I found this to be very interesting, especially 
the "First Principles of Design" link within this page. Thanks.

Excellent, thanks.  Will be very useful in my personal quest for the
most efficient .fvwm2rc on the planet ;-) The only drawback in what
I've read so far (I haven't read the "first principles" yet), is that
they don't talk about keyboard support at all.

Some of that was just silly. For instance, Microsoft hierarchical menus 
do *not* require a user "slide across just right" to move from a 
first-level to a second-level menu as stated in question 6. Microsoft 
menus are on an appear/disappear delay, just like FVWM's.

I like these types of articles when written well, but it's IMO getting 
old seeing Mac people explain why they don't need configurability and 
virtual workspaces to be better than those interfaces that do. I could 
pretend that how I use my computer is appropriate for everyone and make 
a thousand word case for why mouse focus and virtual desktops are better 
than everything. I could make an equally good case for ball peen hammers 
or 16lb bowling balls or spread-bore carburetors. Luckily we FVWM users 
all have choice.

"Magic pixels", autohiding, and large buttons can all be useful, but a 
better article would be one which at least mentions the "trade-offs" 
necessary to acheive these things.

Is there a way for FVWM to find the most used applications? I'm dreaming 
of a command line interface which automatically builds a root menu for 
quick access to the most often used items.

Shay,

I don't think fvwm supports this directly; but you can script it...

If you could wrap all of your apps from a script which keeps a tally of
number of times its been run, then you would be able to create such a 
menu.  Unfortunately, you would still need to restart fvwm before this 
menu is updated.  

So, I wrote an example script (attached as tally.rb, written in ruby, < 60
lines).  One must modify his .fvwm2rc file to use it:

<snip>
	AddToMenu SomeMenu "Apps"
	+ "Browser" Exec exec tally.rb Browser
	+ "Editor" Exec exec tally.rb Editor --some-flag
</snip>

Compared to the original:

<snip>
	AddToMenu SomeMenu "Apps"
	+ "Browser" Exec exec Browser
	+ "Editor" Exec exec Editor --some-flag
</snip>

This script will then generate an fvwm-style menu in some file (the
attached example uses ~/.fvwm_dynamic_menu), which you can include into a
.fvwm2rc (note that you need to restart before changes take effect):

<snip>
	Read .fvwm_dynamic_menu
</snip>

This program could also be used from the command line, i.e.

	nick@home$ tally.rb echo Hello World
	Hello World

But this seems less useful; you cannot supply command line parameters in 
as useful a fashion in programs are launched from a menu.

Hope this helps.

Just to point attention to this: Is it a bug, Dominik?

btw: I have found that my solution does not work reliable. When moving 
the mousepointer to fast, resizing often starts to late after the 
mousewarping so that the mouse pointer is no longer on the window's 
corner and you have to move the mouse back to it. The higher the load of 
my slow machine, the more often this happens.

It would be good to change the order of the commands. First "Resize" and 
then "WarpToWindow", but "Resize" must not block then. I think this is 
not possible.

So it would be great if someone could implement this in fvwm sometime.

Thank you,

Gert

You can make it dynamic, e.g.

+   "&Most Recent%recent.png%"		    Popup Recent
+ DynamicPopupAction Piperead showrecent

An quick example showrecent script - just to show it is working
dynamically:
#!/bin/bash
cat <<EOF
DestroyMenu recreate "Recent"
AddToMenu Recent
+ "`date`"    Exec exec xmessage ok

EOF

The way I would implement this is to use the launch script to log to a
file what is being run, and use a showrecent script to parse this file
and decide what is appropriate to display in the "Most recent" menu. If
you add a timestamp then you can do this by count or by date. Add a cron
job to clear out everything that is too old and this would be really
sweet.

Time to start hacking.

BTW the DynamicPopupAction stuff is straight out of the man page (fvwm
2.5.10)

you can always write a cron job which builds a menu based on ps

Has any one experienced a problem with displays under FVWM generated
using Java? We have several applications which are Java based which
produce displays correctly on all our platforms and window managers,
including FVWM. There is one Java application which works great
everywhere except under FVWM. There, the window size is correct, but the
labeling and buttons are produced in arbritary locations (changes with
each execution). Sometimes the labeling and buttons do not even appear.

Thanks

Sounds like the mechanism to use.  I think I have a working
implementation:

Two scripts: tally.rb (the execution wrapper) and menu.rb (converts the
usage database into a menu).  It sorts them by usage frequency (average
uses per day with second's accuracy) and supports a maximum number of
entries.  menu.rb should be used with DynamicPopupAction...

Example:

<snip>
[nick@manjac rb]$ ./tally.rb xcdroast

[nick@manjac rb]$ ./tally.rb xmms

[nick@manjac rb]$ ./tally.rb xcdroast

[nick@manjac rb]$ ./tally.rb xclock

[nick@manjac rb]$ cat ~/.tally_db 
xclock 1 1083791904
xcdroast 2 1083791870
xmms 1 1083791877     

[nick@manjac rb]$ ./menu.rb 
AddToMenu FrequentMenu "Common Applications" Title
+ "xclock" Exec exec tally.rb xclock # frequency 124.48988376584 uses/day
+ "xcdroast" Exec exec tally.rb xcdroast # frequency 63.2025731382508 uses/day
+ "xmms" Exec exec tally.rb xmms # frequency 37.3364468851539 uses/day

</snip>

(The averages are very large because we're dividing by about 30 seconds or 
so).

The point is, fvwm is great because it's not only configurable by you and 
I, but also by scripts or whatever.  I don't think one could do this kind 
of thing with gnome or kde.

Enjoy,

Hi everybody,

I am using FVWM 2.4.15 with FvwmButtons module that swallows xclock.
After resume from a suspend mode (on notebook), the xclock stops to update
unless I cover it by another application (which apparently generates
the redraw event).
After restarting fvwm, the xclock are working fine.

Does anyone have a similar experience, an idea what's wrong
and how to fix it.

Thanks a lot

Daniel

Yes, we've heard of Java problems before.
As we understand it, it's entirely a Java problem.
When Java detects a window manager it doesn't "know", it
misbehaves.  Upgrading to the lastest Java and Fvwm (in that order)
might help.

Whoa. That is very slick and very generous of you. It looks like it 
would be possible to merge your database with the grun database so that 
those programs run through grun would have command line options applied 
when they are re-running through the most-used menu. Thank you for this. 
I'm sure many of us will make use of it.

You are very right. I got this idea messing around with KDE after 3.2 
came out. Some of the KDE programs are excellent. Knode, in particular 
for reading newsgroups. Knode has nice filtering and displays the number 
of responses under a threaded topic. Kate and Kwrite are also nice and 
Kmail is effortless to set up with SpamAssassin. KDE mouse focus is 
poor, however, and there is no way to make adjustments in focus policy 
for misbehaving programs. With KDE, you pretty much have to live with 
whatever problems/conflics arise from various Linux apps.

I did like the list of frequently used programs at the top of the menu, 
however. Unfortunately, the list was too hard to get to through the 
start button. I'll have the best of both when I get your Ruby scripts 
set up. I might even try to adopt them to a MS style (ME+) menu when 
I've got some time.

I think you misunderstand what fvwm-menu-desktop is for, have you read the
man page? unless you've named your existing menu something like kde-user,
fvwm-menu-desktop isnt going to destroy it.

This doesnt sound right, please post the parts of your rc file to the list
that you use to run fvwm-menu-desktop.

I haven't had any problems running java 1.4.2 with fvwm 2.5.8. I usually
work thru a browser, using jboss and jetty, but Netbeans and JEdit, as
well as stand-alone swing apps, all work with no problems.

Hmmm. I pretty much do this & get the effect you desire (I think).

Is this what you're after?

I've been using mpd (http://www.musicpd.org/) for quite time and I've
created fvwm menus to control it, using fvwm-menu-directory to add files to
the playlists.

I'd like to know how it would actually possible to create a dynamic menu
showing the content of the current playlist.

The command 'mpc playlist' outputs the playlist like this:
# mpc playlist
#1) Artist - Song 1
#2) Artist - Song 2
#3) Artist - Song 3
#4) Artist - Song 4

It is possible to redirect the output of the 'mpc playlist' command to a
file then use the Read command but i'd like to make it more simple (using a
PipeRead)

DestroyFunc PlayListMenu
AddToFunc PlayListMenu
+ I AddToMenu PlayList
+ I DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu Playlist
+ I PipeRead "mpc playlist | sed -e 's/\\(^.*$\\)/+ %menupixmap.png%\"\\1\"
Exec foobar/'"

then just use this function as your MissingSubmenuFunction, and add a Popup
Playlist to your menu. (havn't actually tested it, i dont use mpc, but
should work :)

hi!, i am Miguel,
first: congratulations! fvwm is the best.

i'm designing a visual program to create fvwm2rc files.
i'd like to get (very) complex fvwm2rc files. Mi fvwm2rc have 
600 lines with a few menus, but i think it isn't complex file but
it hasn't script code.
any suggestion is wellcome. 
the program is in the first stage. i think that the program must be easy
to configure but you must have the complex side to do other advance
things.
thanks!

PD: i'm sorry. my written english is bad.

best regards,

i played a little bit with perl and xmmsctrl:
<code>
#!/usr/bin/perl
print 'DestroyMenu MenuXmms
AddToMenu MenuXmms
';

@playlist =`xmmsctrl playlist`;

#del first 8
$pos = `xmmsctrl getpos`;
if ($pos < 5) {$pos=6;}

for ($i=$pos-10;$i<=$pos+10;$i++) {

$tmp=substr($playlist[$i-1],4,100);
$tmo=chomp($tmp);
if ($i == $pos)  {$tmp=".: $tmp :.";}
print "+  \"$tmp\"    exec exec xmmsctrl track $i\n";
}
</code>

i know it's ugly, but hey, it works (kind of)

I take it you want examples of complex fvwm configurations.

Do the following files, under "Current Settings", meet your
definition of complex?

  http://parv.holy.cow/parv/comp/unix/cf/fvwm/

...the actual configuration is divided over 4-6 files, not counting
external programs that create menus/key bindings.

This sounds like a simple X problem.

What is your $DISPLAY environment variable set to?

Try:

export DISPLAY=:0

or

setenv DISPLAY :0

(depending on your shell)

Then:

fvwm2

If that doesn't work, tell us the output of the 'fvwm2' command.

SCoTT. :)

hello,

please,why is it different?
example:
=09MwmDecor / NoDecorHint why? it's better DecorHint / !DecorHint, isn't
it?
 =09OldDecor / NoOldDecor why? it's better OldDecor / !OldDecor, isn't i=
t?
...
when i'm reading my fvwm, it's difficult to find errors
example fvwm2rc:
...
style * MwmDecor
...
...
...
style * NoDecorHint
...

ok it is only a example, but i want a MwmDecor style and it isn't like i
hope. i have to find this style option in fvwm man page and i have to
remember a lot of words... this is only a simple idea.

i'm translating into "human readable" language the fvwm style options
(and menustyle)

i think that there iare two principal sections y my program, a style
editor and menustyle editor... and a general option section too, and
more ...

regards,

Hi Mikhael,

Is there a way to determine the version of FVWM being used from
within a (Perl) module?

I'd like FvwmTabs to determine if the updated WindowList tracker
is available.

SCoTT. :)

Hi

I'd like to use FvwmButtons as a root menu, that is, to have the
following binding

Mouse 1 R A Module FvwmButtons -transient

The manpage of FvwmButtons describes the option -transientpanel, which
merely hides the buttonbox window after clicking on it as opposed to
destroying it.  Here comes the question: how can I "unhide" such a
window?

Thanks,

Piotr

Hi,

it appears to me as if the _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN was not acting
according to the EMWH standard:

from http://freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec/index.html

"_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicates that the window should fill the
entire screen and have no window decorations. For example, a
presentation program would use this hint."

however, the command (after changing "if" to "else if" in line 280)

$ ./hints_test --ewmh-state fullscreen

creates a window without decorations but just 170x100 pixels in size.

This behaviour results in various "bugs" like OpenOffice Impress not
correctly displaying slide shows etc..

I'm using CVS to test this btw.

any comments?

kind regards
-- jochen

If nothing else you can run 'fvwm -V' and grab the version number using regexp

No, if nothing else, 'fvwm-config --version' should be used without
regexp. This is the only guaranteed-format string. Or $[version.num].

Hi,

I'm using fvwm-themes 0.7 with fvwm 2.5.9 and want to change the font.
I've tried using the font selector but it didn't work. What do I have to do?

Thanks Marc

Font of what, menus, window titles, icon titles, pager, TaskBar?

There is no GUI to change fonts, it is all in text files (fvwm configs).

There are 2 solutions in fvwm-themes, the first is to change the font
in the component defining font, like menustyle, windowlook, modules/fonts.
The second is to change the "fonts" filter that affects all fonts.

In both cases you should either modify the system-wide themes configs
(not recomended) or create one file like described in FAQ, for example,
~/.fvwm/themes/personal/menustyle-extra or ~/.fvwm/themes/marc/fonts.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi, all!

Is it possible to make different borders for different sides of window? 
For example, first pixmap for up/left border, second pixmap for 
right/down border or blue left border and red right?

Hello all,

Say I wanted to intercept all X11 events, using an LD_PRELOAD method.  
Assume that _everything_ is dynamically linked.

If I redefine XSendEvent(), should I preload this into the window manager,
or into the X server itself?  If XSendEvent() is not the function I should
intercept, then what should I intercept?


I guess these questions boil down to two questions:
	Who generates XEvents -- the window manager, the X server, or both?
and,
	When generating XEvents, does the source use XSendEvent()?


Thanks a lot,

No. Currently a single colorset/pixmap only may be used for all 4 borders.

both. Applications can also generate X events.

XSendEvent is an Xlib function, so C programs would use this
interface. Other non-C GUI toolkits would use a similar interface.

What exactly are you trying to do?

Perhaps you might be interested in the 'xscope' program (not to
be confused the the Mac xscope program) which lists/logs X events.
Very powerful when combined with 'Xnest' - a favorite development
combination of mine.

Or maybe the 'xev' utility?

Curiouser & curiouser ...

Both, it is just that usually the application in question deals with how
they're dealt with.

Yes.

Hi,

I migrated recently from CTWM/Window-Maker to FVWM 2.4.3. I am=20
overall satisfied, but still trying to get the following behaviour:

1. What is the best way to achieve Windows like alt-tab behavior
(CirculateUp/Next/WindowList) ?

2. How can I get WindowMaker-like 'move to' feature : moving window to
certain desk ?
(Dragging windows on the pager is an unsatisfying compromise)=20

3. Is it possible to have auto arrange function that will arrange only
selected items from the WindowList?

Thanks in advance,

Ari

actually you can use hi #color sh #color in your color set, that will
make the top/left border using the 'hi' and the 'sh' will be for the
right/ bottom borders.

'hi' hilight ; 'sh' shadow
example:

Colorset 10 fg #000000, bg #f2f2f2, hi #30ff00, sh #ff0000
the top/ left are light green, and right / bottom light red so you can
see the diference.

Hi Scott. Thanks for your help but the situation seems to be the  same. Bellow is the fvwm command's output after applying your suggestion

[FVWM][main]: can't open display :0

I also believe this is a X problem. In fact, my intention is to implement a kiosk as explained in http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kiosk-HOWTO.html, which requires fvwm installation. I'm afraid my options are reaching zero in case fvwm doesn't work. Do you know about another way to accomplish the task.

Thanks in advance
Paulo

This sounds like a simple X problem.

What is your $DISPLAY environment variable set to?

Try:

export DISPLAY=:0

or

setenv DISPLAY :0

(depending on your shell)

Then:

fvwm2

If that doesn't work, tell us the output of the 'fvwm2' command.

SCoTT. :)

Scott's instructions were accurate only in part. But then, you're not
exactly giving us enough information to work with either. The error
message that I have quoted above means that either you have X already
running (and you're trying to run fvwm *NOT* as the user that invoked X11)
or you have some other issue (such as incorrect settings on /tmp).

So, let's assume the former case. If you *do* have X11 running, and you
are trying to launch X11 applications from another user, then do:

export DISPLAY=:0 
xauth merge ~user/.Xauthority

whereby "~user" is the name of the user that already has X11 running. Of
course, that user won't be root because you wouldn't be a foolish as that;
I hope. :)

As for the /tmp settings, ensure they are:

chmod 777 /tmp

The actual look highly depends on HandleWidth (BorderWidth) and other
border options.

With most of border widths and options your suggestion does not produce
the desired effect. Although "desired" is something subjective.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I just  have a dumb  question: what is  the advantage to  have several
desktops when you can with only one have unlimited pages ?

I mean, I don't really see, what is the purpose of it ;)

If I take my situation, I have one desktop with 4 pages (2x2).

In other window managers, it would be treated as 4 virtual desktops.

Another question, is  there a simple way to have "named"  pages ? I mean
I want my  4 pages to have different  names just the same as if  I had 4
desktops.

Dunno if I am clear ;)

THe work is almost done but still in progress.

What   I  want   is  obtain   your  authorization   to  publish   it  at
http://fvwmfr.org.

We  also plan to  translate the  man pages,  do I  need to  request your
authorization too ?

Regards,

I have 2 desks of 4 pages each.
I only have one desk visible at a time.
I have fvwm2rc set up to switch desks w/ middle button over the page i want.
So i can go to all 8, tho only 4 are visible.

As far as I can tell, the main difference between them is that windows can
span different pages of a desk, while windows cannot span desk boundaries.  
Also, the visual area can span page boundaries, but not desk boundaries.  

Personally, I just have multiple desks with one page per desk.  I don't 
think the benefits of pages are so great; I tend to maximize everything.

To what degree must they be named?  Is it sufficient for all the menu 
entries that refer to them to call them by a name?

Hi Thomas. Thanks for your attention. Your tip was very usefull too. Sorry =
for not supplying enough informations about my problem. In order to correct=
 my mistake, I'd say X11 wasn't running when I was invoking fvwm (as a regu=
lar user). After read your last message, I've proceeded as the following co=
mmand at the Linux prompt:

[user@my_machine_name] xinit

At the prompt issued by X11 is typed:

[user@my_machine_name] fvwm2

Fvwm is launched differently than expected. No icons, no taskbar, you know,=
 no elements usually presented in other window managers. Only an analogic c=
lock at the rigth-bottom corner of the screen, some additional areas surrou=
nding it and nothing else. Is it normal or should I do something else in sy=
stem.fvwm2rc.

Thanks in advance
Paulo

Scott's instructions were accurate only in part. But then, you're not
exactly giving us enough information to work with either. The error
message that I have quoted above means that either you have X already
running (and you're trying to run fvwm *NOT* as the user that invoked X11)
or you have some other issue (such as incorrect settings on /tmp).

So, let's assume the former case. If you *do* have X11 running, and you
are trying to launch X11 applications from another user, then do:

export DISPLAY=3D:0=20
xauth merge ~user/.Xauthority

whereby "~user" is the name of the user that already has X11 running. Of
course, that user won't be root because you wouldn't be a foolish as that;
I hope. :)

As for the /tmp settings, ensure they are:

chmod 777 /tmp

You don't need any authorization.

That's very exciting. Unlike you, my computer usage chart would be very 
curvy. I might work for a month on POV-Ray every night, then switch to 
working on my comic for a few weeks, then work on a web page for a week 
or so. Your project interests me because FVWM could be made to adapt to 
my changes in the manner that later Windows versions do (but to an even 
greater degree).

This is the part which I found most exciting:
<Quoted from link>
There should be a correlation between the frequency of use of documents 
and how easy it is for me to access those documents. For example, if one 
were to look at my home directory's structure, one would notice that 
current projects are only one directory deep, where older projects get 
moved deeper into the directory structure.
</Quote from link>

The most recently used files could even be written into an autohide 
fvwmbuttons panel.

I hope this project really takes off and that others take interest. For 
users like myself or my wife ( a college student ) with hundreds of 
stored files and projects, along with a good number of programs needed 
at different times for working on those projects, the functionality you 
have planned would cause a *major* shift in how we use our computers.

You must be using a version prior to 2.4.25. Subsequent releases renamed
the binary back to 'fvwm'.

Do you have a ~/.xsession file? Look here:

http://www.hantslug.org.uk/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?LinuxHints/StartX

for details.

You should ensure that your:

~/.fvwm2rc

file exists.

I  think (but  I may  be  wrong) you  have to  have two  different-named
FvwmPager say  FvwmPager1 and  FvwmPager2. Then you  can have  and apply
style for each of them without interference.

Anyone can confirm ?

For example,  but I was  thinking more on  having their name  shown into
the Pager. My  main desktop (ie. the only one)  would be unnamed whereas
its pages would be named.

What do  you mean ? For  each of this, all  is totally up  to the users.
You have several possibilities for each of them.

Actually, you can do Alt-Tab'in just the way you are used to do.

WindowsList is  (for me) bound to  Mouse2 button and a  key binding. You
also can use mouse gestures if you want to (given you have a dynamically
linked agains libstroke FVWM version).

So it is really up to you to choose between all those possibilites. 

FVWM is known to  be really flexible (this is why I  tend to use it more
and more :)).

Juste hit  on google for that.  There are gazillons of  examples. Here I
have a menu with different possible windows operations.

I don't understand.

Hope that'll help ;) 

I have to tell I am quite  n00bish at FVWM but everyday I discover a new
cool and neat feature and as a Ion2 user, I am totally amazed by FVWM.

I don't think you can name pages with FvwmPager, and the man page doesn't
seem to include mention of this, but I can think of at least two hacks
which have the same (visual) effect:

One option would be to use FvwmButtons to swallow the FvwmPager, and then
put the names above each respective page using either (a) a button with a
title and no action, or (b) images of the page names.  This can be 
tedious until you get the hang of FvwmButtons :(

Another option would be to use a background pixmap for the FvwmPager, and
make that image such that it has the name of each page at the right
locations.  The names would then be obscured by any windows in those 
pages :(

How big is your pager?

If someone knows a less hackish way of doing this, go with that.

I've heard the same.

from http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/manpages/unstable/FvwmPager.php:
<snip>
To use FvwmPager with several different configurations, you can invoke 
FvwmPager with an optional parameter, which it will use as its name 
instead (e.g "Module FvwmPager OtherPager"). OtherPager will then read 
only the lines in the configuration file starting with "*OtherPager", and 
not the lines belonging to FvwmPager. This way multiple pager instances 
may be used.

If I understand correctly, [2] is asking about a pull down menu with "Move
to page 1", "Move to page 2", ...  If this is correct, then check out my
.fvwm2rc.  Note specifically the alt-tab section and the MoveWindow menu.

You should look at the FvwmRearrange module (I appologize if you already 
have).  I don't know to what degree it allows for selecting only some.

Tomas, it would be nice if only exact verified information is provided.

There is _no_ such version 2.4.25 or anything similar to this number.

It is factually _not_ true that the executable was renamed in 2.4.x.
The fact is, starting from 2.4.8 the symbolic link "fvwm" is installed.
(Still "fvwm" is a preferable executable name in both 2.4.x and 2.5.x.)

Having ~/.xsession file is in no way a requirement for running fvwm.
It may be started from ~/.xinitrc for example.

This is normal supposing you have some old system.fvwm2rc on your system.
I guess, it is safe to remove this system.fvwm2rc file completely.

If your goal is still to have a Kiosk-like mode, then please go to
http://fvwm.org/contact/ and type "kiosk" or other keywords to try to
find useful suggestions.

If you need a fully functional desktop instead, you probably want to
start with fvwm-themes.

Having ~/.fvwm2rc file is in no way a requirement for running fvwm.
In fact, this file is highly discouraged in favour of ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
(or even ~/.fvwm/config in the latest cvs version).

It's true, pages can't be named, but if desks of 1x1 pages are good for
you, then you may arrange 6 desks as 2x3, each desk having its own label.

This is a good solution for, say, 2x2 or 3x2 page layout.

Well, you may try half transparent mini-windows then, I think. See FAQ.

I don't. It is easier to name desks (using DesktopName command).

P.S. Please give more meaningful subject lines. Noone is going to google
for "dumb question", but people may be interested in "page labels".

You miss my point, and I appreciate that one can start it from ~/.xinitrc
(sometimes, ~/.xinitrc is symlinked to ~/.xsession). The fact that the OP
said that he now had *something* running via X, was enough for me to
suggest that he can use that file as a means of launching a desired window
manager.

Be that as it may, I came to an old conclusion based on erroneous facts.
But I am not quibbling this one in the slightest....

Sorry - I didn't explain myself properly. I meant other GUI toolkits
that aren't written in C would use a similar interface. For example,
FvwmTabs uses the CPAN X11::Protocol module which "talks" with the
X server directly - no C, all Perl.

Tk is most definitely written in C.

Yes  sure ;)  Apologize for  that.  I can  at least  rename the  current

Thank you for your answers. I think I will have 6 desktops of 1x1 size.

Yes. You will atleast need version 2.5.[don't remember exactly, better
get 10] for that to work.

Hi there, I'm having real trouble understanding how to use schedule
correctly so that my scheduled jobs will work (or at least remain queued)
during periods where, for example, the pointer is grabbed.

I have a function that I would like to continue running every few seconds
testing a condition, and performing an action, until the window is deleted.

basically, like this:

AddToFunc NewWindowFunc
+ I Test (foobar) Exec something
+ I Echo Still running!
+ I Schedule 5000 NewWindowFunc

The idea is to keep a xwd cache of windows while they are unobscured, so
that when they are obscured I can still use screenshots of them, I would
like to use FvwmEvent to start a function like this in the context of all
new windows, then just keep testing every few seconds (the overhead seems
pretty low in my tests). But my scheduled jobs keep dissapearing, can anyone
offer any suggestions?

This is what I have right now, it works, but I would like to be able to just
keep caching without some event happening:

# FvwmEvent runs on some events:
AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent ExposeCache
DestroyModuleConfig ExposeCache: *
*ExposeCache: add_window CacheWindow
*ExposeCache: raise_window CacheWindow
*ExposeCache: focus_change CacheWindow
*ExposeCache: dewindowshade CacheWindow
*ExposeCache: destroy_window "Exec rm -f $[FVWM_USERDIR]/cache.$[w.id].xwd"

# Take a picture
AddToFunc CacheWindow I ThisWindow (Raised, !Shaded, !Iconic) Exec nice xwd
-screen -silent -id $[w.id] -out $[FVWM_USERDIR]/cache.$[w.id].xwd

AddToFunc ExitFunction I Exec rm -f $[FVWM_USERDIR]/cache.*

# WindowList style command...
DestroyFunc FvwmExpose
AddToFunc FvwmExpose
+ I AddToMenu FvwmExposeMenu ".: e x p o s e :." Title
+ I + DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu FvwmExposeMenu
+ I All (CurrentDesk, AcceptsFocus) Test (f
$[FVWM_USERDIR]/cache.$[w.id].xwd) \
    PipeRead "convert -scale 128 -frame 1x1 -mattecolor black -quality 0
xwd:$[FVWM_USERDIR]/cache.$[w.id].xwd \
	png:$[FVWM_USERDIR]/icon.exp.$[w.id].png && echo AddToMenu FvwmExposeMenu
\
	%$[FVWM_USERDIR]/icon.exp.$[w.id].png%\\\'\"$[w.name]\"\\\' WindowID
$[w.id] WindowListFunc \
	&& echo AddToMenu FvwmExposeMenu \\\"\\\" Nop || echo Nop"
+ I Popup FvwmExposeMenu
+ I Exec exec rm -f $[FVWM_USERDIR]/icon.exp.*

Thanks you all for your help !

However, neither of the solutions proposed worked on my 2.4 version.

johan's solutions yields: Unknown option - CurrentAtEnd
While Nicholas's alt-tab section gave me a very strange windows scroll
order.


As for the FvwmArrange - didn't find there any explicit support for
arranging only some (selected) windows from the desktop.


Will be happy to get more suggestions ! =20

Being a big fan of the keyboard, this is how I move my windows between

    Key F1     A S  MoveToPage 0 0

This is from IIRC an old default fvwm2rc :

# Circulate focus
Key   Tab       A    M      Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key   Tab       A    MS     Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key   Tab       A    CM     Next [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus
Key   Tab       A    CMS    Prev [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus

I still use it in mine, though it can be unpredictable sometimes. It is
by no means completely Windows like.

I posted a similar question a couple of weeks ago but there were no
replies.  The manual says that a scheduled command X will be executed
in the same window context as "Schedule 4234 X", but it's rather vague
on how this is implemented.  I can only _speculate_ that when the
pointer is about to leave a window, all scheduled commands for that
window are executed.  What happens to all Schedule commands issued by
these scheduled commands I don't know.  Sometimes they seem to
disappear.  Sometimes not.

At the moment, I'm using FvwmAuto to take a screenshot of every window
that has had focus for at least 10 seconds (once) and it works pretty
well.  But I probably will switch to your method soon.

Tavis> But my scheduled jobs keep dissapearing, can anyone

Since it's a mystery for me what exactly happens to scheduled command
while switching the window context, I'd (re)schedule NewWindowFunc
every time the window context is changed (using FvwmEvent).  To avoid
having more and more "threads" taking snapshots, I'd use a fixed
schedule id (say 173) and add deschedule to the code:

AddToFunc NewWindowFunc
+ I Test (foobar) Exec something
+ I Echo Still running!
+ I Deschedule 173
+ I Schedule 173 5000 NewWindowFunc

I'de like to get my screenshot added to the fvwm.org site.

Thumbnail: http://tjw.org/screen/preview.png
Full:      http://tjw.org/screen/screenshot.png

Description:

This screenshot shows fvwm 2.5.10 working in Xinerma mode.  There are 
two seperate FvwmTaskbars running, one for each screen even though both 
monitors act as one large logical screen.  The xterm icons are not 
images, and update in real time using xterm's activeIcon option.  The 
bottom FvwmButtons Panel contains swallowed xloadtimes running on 
serveral servers (tunneled through ssh).  All fvwm config files and my 
latest screenshot are always available at http://tjw.org/screen/

Thanks,

-Tony

I use a 4x4 Pager, giving me 16 screens.  I have a "Send to Page..."
item on my WindowOps menu that opens a popup listing the 16 paaible
pages, the entries on which perform a MoveToPage x y.

naturally, the popup is displayed as:

 | ...              |
 | (De)Iconify      |
 | (Un)Stick)       |
 | (un)Maximize     |
 | ---------------- |____
 | Send to Page... >| 1  |
 | Delete           | 2  |
 | Close            | 3  |
 | Destroy          | 4  |
 | ...              | ...|

What I'd LIKE it to do is this:

 | ...              |
 | (De)Iconify      |
 | (Un)Stick)       |
 | (un)Maximize     |
 | ---------------- |_____________
 | Send to Page... >| 1  2  3  4  |
 | Delete           | 5  6  7  8  |
 | Close            | 9  10 11 12 |
 | Destroy          | 13 14 15 16 |
 | ...              |-------------


Can anyone suggest a way to accomplish this?  I'm assuming I'll have to
use something like a transient button banel.

Thanks Piotr, you gave me some ideas to think about :)

This is what I'm using right now which seems to work quite well (and the 
overhead of running xwd every few seconds is not noticable at all), I've
had to use PassId instead of $[w.id] because it gets confused if a window
dies..

I have it bound to my Menu key, like this:

You can't open any new window while browsing menus.

So, you may wait for the native tabular menus implementation if any...

Or you may have a menu entry that is Module, not Popup, to open transient
FvwmButtons instead of the menu (unlike the diagram above).

Or, if you are a programmer, you may add a new command line option to the
transient FvwmPager to execute MoveToPage instead of GotoPage on click.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hmmm.  That would be an elegant solution, wouldn't it?

I've tried the transient fvwm buttons solution, here is what I've found:

Because the button is pushed from within the context of GridButtons, 
the MoveToDesk (and presumably similar commands) still require the user 
select a window.

Also, the buttons start at +0+0, which I do not know how to fix :(

Either way, here is an example .fvwm2rc.  If anyone can get it to work 
better, I too would like to see it :)

Bah, you just have to tell it to be at your cursor position, no ?

Yes... I think transient FvwmButtons should preserve the original window
context. But you may workaround this, like:

  AddToMenu Window-Ops2
  + "Move to Page" SelectPageToMoveWindow

  AddToFunc SelectPageToMoveWindow
  + I SetEnv LAST_WIN_ID $[w.id]
  + I FvwmButtons -g 128x64+$[pointer.x]+$[pointer.y] -transient GridButtons

  AddToFunc MoveLastWindowToDesk
  + I WindowId $[LAST_WIN_ID] MoveToDesk 0 $0

  *GridButtons: (Title "0", Action "MoveLastWindowToDesk 0")
  [...]
  *GridButtons: (Title "7", Action "MoveLastWindowToDesk 7")

Not tested, but if the code you posted works for you, then this one
should work too.

> Also, the buttons start at +0+0, which I do not know how to fix :(

Using -g command line option, see the code above. You may also make it
centered under cursor, just calculate appropriate coordinates.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This works fairly nicely for me, like so:

AddToFunc SendWindowToPage
+	I	SetEnv LAST_WIN_ID $[w.id]
+	I	FvwmButtons -g 144x96+$[pointer.x]+$[pointer.y] -transient GridButtons

AddToFunc MoveLastWindowToPage
+	I	WindowId $[LAST_WIN_ID] MoveToPage $0 $1

DestroyModuleConfig GridButtons
*GridButtons: columns 4
*GridButtons: rows 4
*GridButtons: (Title "0",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 0 0")
*GridButtons: (Title "1",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 1 0")
...
*GridButtons: (Title "15", Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 3 3")


except that FvwmButtons is not honoring the -g specification
144x96+$[pointer.x]+$[pointer.y].  Size alone is honored, size+position
is honored if the position is a fixed specification, but the
pointer-position specification does not work.  What is the first fvwm2
version in which the $[pointer.x] notation should be valid? I'm running
2.4.16 at present.

2.5.1, you may read NEWS file on the web to get such info.

Actually, it may look nicer (or not) if such transient window is just
centered on the screen.

BTW, to be really accurate, it should be escaped in some cases, i.e.
$$[pointer.x], to avoid too early expansion.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, looks like I now have a reason to move to 2.5.

I have just downloaded and installed 2.5.10, and it's now working.  I
have a visually-reasonabl;e static offset set up as follows:

DestroyFunc SendWindowToPage
AddToFunc SendWindowToPage
+		I	SetEnv LAST_WIN_ID $[w.id]
+		I	. FvwmButtons -g 144x96+%{ $[pointer.x]-34
}%+%{ $[pointer.y]-24 }% -transient GridButtons

However, I'd LIKE to be able to make the button panel position itself
such that the pointer is on the button corresponding to the current
page.  To do that, however, I need to retrieve the current page.  I know
I can retrieve the current *desk* thropugh the variable desk.n, so I
guessed page.n but found my guess was wrong.

Is there such a variable, and if so, what is it?  Where can I find
documentation of all the available variables?

Never mind, after forcibly dumping outdated manpages, I found it.

So, you got at least FvwmPerl too by switching to 2.5.x.

You almost got it right, but pages span 2 directions, thus $[page.nx] and
$[page.ny].

In the man page. You may easily consider any feature not found in the man
pages unexisting.

And that is indeed where I found it, once I first found the outdated
manpage that was getting picked up ahead of it and removed it.

Incidentally, you get some really odd visual effects if you start
fvwm-2.5.10 with the ModulePath still pointing to fvwm-2.4.16....

Oh, at any rate, here's my final code, for anyone else's reference who
might care to use it:

DestroyFunc .
AddToFunc .
+ I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*

DestroyFunc SendWindowToPage
AddToFunc SendWindowToPage
+ I SetEnv LAST_WIN_ID $[w.id]
+ I . FvwmButtons -g 144x96+%{$[pointer.x]-$[page.nx]*36-34}%+%{$[pointer.y]-$[page.ny]*24-20}% -transient GridButtons

DestroyFunc MoveLastWindowToPage
AddToFunc MoveLastWindowToPage
+ I WindowId $[LAST_WIN_ID] MoveToPage $0 $1

DestroyModuleConfig GridButtons
#*GridButtons: geometry 144x96
*GridButtons: columns 4
*GridButtons: rows 4
*GridButtons: (Title "0",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 0 0")
*GridButtons: (Title "1",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 1 0")
*GridButtons: (Title "2",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 2 0")
*GridButtons: (Title "3",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 3 0")
*GridButtons: (Title "4",  Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 0 1")
....
*GridButtons: (Title "15", Action "MoveLastWindowToPage 3 3")


This creates a 4x4 button panel, essentially the same size as my pager,
which pops up under the mouse pointer with the button representing the
current page under the pointer, thus making all the adjacent pages the
shortest mouse movement away.

Hey all,

I've been trying unsuccessfully to get fvwm 2.5.7 to swallow jpilot on startup.
The icon just lands on the desktop.  I've tried various names in the
.fvwm2rc, e.g.

   *FvwmButtons (1x1 Frame 0 Swallow(UseOld) "FvwmPager" "Module FvwmPager 0 0")
   *FvwmButtons: (Swallow FvwmXclock 'Exec xclock -name "FvwmXclock" -geometry +0+0 -padding 1 -bg grey67 &')
   *FvwmButtons: (Swallow "JPilot" 'Exec jpilot -name "jpilot" -geometry +0+0 -padding 1 -bg grey67 &')

FvwmIdent identifies the icon as

so I've tried swallowing all 4 names to no avail.  Can anybody head me in the

Hello,

2 quick questions:

1) Is  it more powerfull  to use vector  buttons instead of XPM/PNG  ? I
   mean what is best not to waste cycles ?

2) How can I produce my  own window decorations (ie. buttons) ? Is there
   any tool that can graphically show  me what I am typing (what vectors
   look like) ?

Thank you

Xavier

2.5.7.

Yeah, I guess I left some things unsaid.  Jpilot gets swallowed if I don't
start it iconic but of course then the icon box is fairly hosed since the
full-sized app is jammed inside it.

Probably vectors are faster than xpm/png.
I've used windows with 5 xpm's per window, plus xpm's tiled on the
borders on very slow machines with no noticable slowdown.

There was a tool like that at this address:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/eps2vector.pl

but the web site has disappeared.

Well, they are both powerful, I use a background pixmap with alpha blending
and vectors stacked on top to draw the button emblems. The major advantage
of vectors (imho) is that they use Colorsets, so changing a window's
colorset updates the vectors to match.

In my experience, vectors are faster than using pixmaps for buttons, but i
dont have any stats to back that up :)

It's not too hard to write them (it is difficult at first, but it gets
easier), I think theres a perl script somewhere that can convert xfig
graphics into vectors, i think it's called eps2vector.

Have you tried "Jpilot" instead of "JPilot"?

-}Have you tried "Jpilot" instead of "JPilot"?

Yes.  I've tried all 4 of the names I've listed - the "name", the icon name,
the class and the resource.  The space is made in the iconbox for the app
but the app never shows up in the box, it merely iconifies on the desktop.

Oh, sorry.

I invoke it from my WindowOps menu at present:

AddToMenu Window-Ops	"Window Ops"		Title		
...
+			"(Un)Maximize"		Maximize
+			""			Nop
+			"Send to &Page..."	SendWindowTopage
+			"Delete"		Delete
...


I'm thinking of also assigning it to button 8, but haven't designed a
suitable vector button yet.  (Though I have ideas.)

Simple question:
Can a vector button have multiple vectors on it?  (I'd like to create a
vector button with multiple raised areas.)
If so, how?
If not, I guess I'll have to work around it with a long serpentine
polyline, or perhaps a bitmap.

I have.  It doesn't answer my question.

In the meantime, I've been playing around and have learned a few things.
It seemed at first as though I could have no more than 16 points, but
this appears not to be the case, as I've now successfully created a
vector button with 45 points.  I have figured out the following:

  - A button without a function assigned to it will not be drawn, even
    if assigned a style.
  - A button can only have a single vector chain.  This isn't
    necessarily a problem, because vector segments can be made
    effectively invisible.
  - An error in the point list may cause the button not to be drawn, or
    may cause it to be drawn using a different ButtonStyle, depending
    on the nature of the error.  The error may or may not be logged in
    .xsession-errors, and if logged, the message may or may not tell you
    anything useful about what the actual error was.
  - I don't know if there's an upper limit to the number of points, but
    if so, it's at least 45.
  - Although vector coordinates are on a scale of 1..100 (increments of
    1%), the useful resolution is closer to increments of 5%, unless you
    have really friggin' HUGE buttons.


Anyway, after playing with this for a while, I've got two titlebar
buttons and two sets of functions for sending windows to a specified
page or a specified desk.  The COMPLETE code, with vector buttons and
window menu entries, follows.  Note that I've now made the placement of
the button panels smarter, as necessitated for titlebar button use; the
old version of SendWindowToPage, if used on a titlebar button, would
often appear partly offscreen.  This version fixes that.

Anyway, here's the code, and the attached PNG shows the appearance of
the new buttons.

Well, configs of some samples do answer your question. AFAIR.

The number of points was increased in 2.5.x two years ago. This is why
specifying fvwm version is always important.

I think this is in FAQ.

No, you may apply multiple AddButtonStyle as needed.

Well, you don't draw buttons very often to justify a complete syntax
error diagnostics system, do you? :)

It is 10000.

This is possibly because you use 3-d like relief that is 2 pixels wide.
If you use flat decorations, then entire 100% is available. I think.

No time to read/play with this config for now. Maybe later.
Or you may just post a screenshot url.

OK, let me rephrase that:  "I did not see any button configs in those
button samples that answered the questions I had."

Out of curiosity, what was the old limit?

OK, none of the examples illustrates this, and it's not apparent from
the documentation (unless I missed something, which is entirely
possible).

Very true.  :)  I guess my point was, "If one of these things happens,
it probably means you have a subtle error in your point list.  Look at it
more carefully, but don't necessarily expect to be able to figure it out
from the .xsession-errors output."

Hmmmm......   I find myself pondering a vector-button-drawing tool that
lets you draw a button, then outputs the vector list to generate it.
I'll give it some thought.

I think it's more that the buttons just plain *aren't very big* if your
titlebar font is a reasonable size.  There's only just so many pixels
available.  No matter what you do, you can't get 100 points of physical
resolution across a button that's only 20 pixels wide.

Well, that's what the PNG was -- a partial window screenshot showing the
left side of the titlebar.


(Oh, and I meant to elide repetitive rows in the PageButtonGrid
definition ....  sorry about that.)

Well, partly this is lack of clarity on my part, and partly, no, a point
is not a vector.  A point is a point.  I was trying to use the term
'vector chain' to refer to a single figure, if you will, or connected
series of figures, drawn on the button by vector means.  I should
probably more correctly have used the term polyline (and in fact,
Polyline would be a more accurate term for fvwm to use than Vector). 
The style below, with 45 points, properly contains 44 vectors forming a
single polyline.

What I was trying to ask was whether I could have a button on which two
separate polylines were drawn, since at the time I was under the
impression that a polyline in a Vector style specification could not
include more than 16 points.  In that case, if one wanted a button
design containing more than 16 points, it would be necessary to use
multiple vector chain specifications.

Mikhael (I think) subsequently pointed out that multiple styles can be
added to a button using AddButtonStyle.  However, since button style
polylines in fvwm-2.5 can contain up to 10000 points, I don't anticipate
ever needing to do so, as that's sufficient points to draw a line in
each possible vector color from every pixel on the button to every other
pixel on the button.  :)

Correct, in a single polyline.

I have several chains per button in my configuration, one draws the emblem,
another draws a shadow for it and another draws a border.

for example:

AddButtonStyle  8 Active Vector 9 40x40@2 45x35@2 55x35@2 60x40@2 60x45@2
50x50@2 50x55@2 50x65@4 50x65@2 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle  8 InActive Vector 9 40x40@3 45x35@3 55x35@3 60x40@3 60x45@3
50x50@3 50x55@3 50x65@4 50x65@3 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle  8 AllUp Vector 7 40x45@1 45x40@1 55x40@1 60x50@4 50x60@1
50x75@4 50x75@1 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle  All Active Vector 9 80x60@4 80x40@2 60x20@2 40x20@2 20x40@2
20x60@2 40x80@2 60x80@2 80x60@2 -- Flat
AddButtonStyle  All Inactive Vector 9 80x60@4 80x40@2 60x20@2 40x20@2
20x40@2 20x60@2 40x80@2 60x80@2 80x60@2 -- Flat

(This is supposed to be a Question mark :)

Hello,

I was wondering how can one make all the windows
look like windows defined as Sticky?
The 3 stripes across the title looks nice, and
I would like to have them in all window decors.

This is best wm for me so far,

Thank you.

Mikko

Last 2 samples on the web use AddButtonStyle (it is not really needed in
the last sample, I think).

Did you see the script posted a day ago that enables drawing using xfig?

Looks good. Although I don't like "bg" colors that have corresponding "hi"
color that is actually darker. I like light (even if white) "hi" colors.
But this is much less annoying than meaningless subject lines in threads.

You almost answered yourself in the subject, but your name has a typo:

  Style * StippledTitle

Yes, I dug that up from the manpages, the StrippledTitle(-s). :)
But, for some reason, I can not get the stripes on windows.
I am a bit lost in the configuration file, it could most probably
be because of that (http://whitecortex.net/~mikko/dot.fvwm2rc)
Although, I've picked most of it from system.fvwm2rc and manpages.

Thank you,

Mikko

I looked at your config, and I saw this line:

Style * SloppyFocus, ClickToFocusPassesClick, ClickToFocusRaises, \
        MouseFocusClickRaises, GrabFocusOff, \
		NoPPosition, NoIcon


You therefore just need to add "StippledTitle" to the list, thus:

Style * SloppyFocus, ClickToFocusPassesClick, ClickToFocusRaises, \
        MouseFocusClickRaises, GrabFocusOff, \
		NoPPosition, NoIcon, StippledTitle

No, I don't think I did.  I'll have to scan back and look for it.

Sorry about that...  I typo'd in my mailer, meant to correct it before I
sent, then forgot to do so because it was so long between starting the
message and actually sending it (about 4 hours).

Look closely at the fvwm web page for window decorations.
There is a link to the tool there.

You can use the syntax like:

50+1px

to get a point at 50% plus 1 pixel.
So you would draw each line 2 times with +/- 1 pixel on either X or Y
direction.

Look at the man-page and examples on the homepage.

Hey,

Two questions,

1. Does anyone know how to do the following:

	Whenever NumLock is off, and I push 1,2,3,4,6,7,8, or 9 I would
	like the mouse cursor to be moved in the coresponding direction.  
	If NumLock is off and I push 5, I would like the same behaviour as
	if I had pushed the left mouse button.



2. Also, I trigger alt-tab events like this:

	Key Tab A M     Function Cycle

Which works when NumLock is off.  How do I make it also work when NumLock 
is on?

w00t,

That's possible. Just bind your keypad key's to mouse movements (example
of this is in  the ~/.fvwm/fvwm2rc file distributed with fvwm

You can only do this if you have:

IgnoreModifiers L25

in your config file, but then this makes no odds either way with the
numlock key. You might also want to see the Fvwm FAQ 0.1 :)

I believe on most XFree86 systems this keypad-emulates-pointer extension
is loaded and you may activate/disactivate it by pressing Shift-NumLock.
Try it, should work exactly like you want without any action from fvwm.

One of the solution is to add this line:

  Key Tab A M2  WindowList Root c c     # or: Function Cycle

Is there a way to tell FVWM 2.5.10 to center all newly created windows
(with some exceptions based on the window name)?

Right now, I'm using FvwmEvent's add_window command to do it, but the
window is created first then moved, which looks crappy.  Here's what I'm
doing now, which works but makes windows jump around when they are first
created:

	AddToFunc StartFunction
	+ I Module FvwmEvent

	*FvwmEvent: StartDelay 5
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd
	*FvwmEvent: add_window "Function MyPositionWindow"

	AddToFunc MyPositionWindow
	+ I ThisWindow ("Emacs") Nop
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break
	+ I ThisWindow ("XTerm") Nop
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break
	+ I ThisWindow ("Download:Manager") Move 0 0
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break
	+ I ThisWindow ("asclock") Move -0p -0p
	+ I TestRc (Match) Break
	+ I ThisWindow Function MyCenterWindow     # Center all others by default

Is there a way to do this that prevents windows from being moved after
they are created?

FvwmEvent or a similar module is the only way to do it currently.

Until we have CenterPlacement policy, or better yet CustomPlacement
policy with some protocol to interact with modules/scripts.

Hello,
I thought to put an update on this.
I made a clean .fvwm2rc file, in which I put:
Style * StrippledTitle
After I startx (xinit), I get on console:
[FVWM][style_parse_and_set_window_style]: <<ERROR>> \
Bad style option: StrippledTitle
After I also tried:
Style "*" StrippledTitle
With same effect.
It is curious, since Sticky uses this, and it
does indeed work with Sticky.

Mikko

Mikko, I think I wrote already that you have a typo in this name.

It is "StippledTitle", not "StrippledTitle", remove "r".

I try to build a dynamic menu to show
running fvwm modules.

DestroyMenu ModulePopup
AddToMenu ModulePopup
 + DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu ModuleList
 + MissingSubmenuFunction funcModuleList
 + "KillModule"    Popup   ModuleList

DestroyFunc funcModuleList
AddToFunc funcModuleList
 + I PipeRead `ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e
"s/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\\+\\).*/AddToMenu ModuleList \\2 KillModule
\\2/"|sort|uniq`

However, the PipeRead command stream is rendered as:
``28876 ?        R      0:00 sh -c ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e
"s/\(.*\)\/\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\+\).*/AddToMenu ModuleList \2 KillModule
\2/"|sort|uniq"

And this causes an error message:
[FVWM][__execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command '28876'

Any idea how to fix this? Thank you!

Do you know about X11 Mouse Keys? It's an accessibility feature for users
that have difficulty using a mouse that sounds similar to what you want
without any need to create bindings, try pressing Shift+Alt+Num_Lock.

Yes, but not if he uses the IgnoreModifiers command you used below. The
FakeClick command can be used to simulate mouse clicks.

No..I Think he wants to use Num-Lock as a modifier, not totally kill it :)

You can just add a binding for when Num-Lock is in use.

Key Tab A M     Blah
Key Tab A M2    Blah

Also, L25 also disables scroll-lock (according to the man page you should
disable as few modifiers as possible).

If your sed allows, use a delimiter other than '/' so that you do
not have to escape it to reduce the clutter...

  echo 'damn/it' | sed -e 's!damn/!bloody !'


In other words, use a delimiter that does not occur in search
pattern or replacement to minimize number of things to focus on.

I have a feeling, but have not actually tried, that you may be
overescaping things in sed command.

Notice that you are using ``, to execute a command in subshell
instead of '' which may or may not matter to fvwm. Try with '' or ""
instead of `` in any case.

Parv, why not just open FvwmConsole and verify your (wrong) theory? :)

Ok, let's analyze the situation. Suppose we all have GNU tools and this
command (pasted from the top of this message) indeed generates the menu:

  % ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e "s/\\(.*\\)\\/\\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\\+\\).*/AddToMenu ModuleList \\2 KillModule \\2/"|sort|uniq

First, the choice of double quotes cause you double backslashes,
this is needless. Rewrite this shell command using a single quote:

  % ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e 's/\(.*\)\/\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\+\).*/AddToMenu ModuleList \2 KillModule \2/'|sort|uniq

Now, you have 2 choices. First, to try to insert one of these commands
into PipeRead. To do this, you should escape all backslash using another
backspace (or maybe even replace each backslash with 4 backspaces, yes).
Dollars should sometimes be escaped too. You may play with it until you
get it correctly.

Another (preferable) choice is to create ~/bin/fvwm-menu-mymodulelist
script that contains our single line and just call it:

  + I PipeRead `fvwm-menu-mymodulelist`

Mikhael.

Good to know; i did not find any mention of
'`|back.?ticks|sub.?shell' in the above context in the manual.

As to use of FvwmConsole ... i tried to replicate OP's menu
generation there.  That takes to much time, here at least, to test
instead of update-configuration-restart-fvwm cycle.  I have given up
on the idea of using FvwmConsole any further for any reason for now.

Argh! Bear w/ me as i stop the above piece of misinformation from
myself.

In fvwm(1) page, section 'QUOTING', paragraph 3, '`' is apparently
listed as 'reverse single quote'.  In the same paragraph, it is
stated further that all three types of quotes--double quotes, single
quotes, backticks or reverse single quotes--are treated the same.

Great tips!
But:
AddToFunc funcModuleList
 + I PipeRead `ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e 's!\\(.*\\)/\\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\\+\\).*!AddToMenu
ModuleList \\2 KillModule \\2!'|sort -u`
already works in the popup menu.
I am just confused by the error messages in ~/.xsession-errors:
[FVWM][__execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command '15958'

Then I try starting 'fvwm -D' for debugging and know that
'`ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e 's!\\(.*\\)/\\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\\+\\).*!AddToMenu ModuleList
\\2 KillModule \\2!'|sort -u`'
is rendered by fvwm as:
'15958 ?        R      0:00 sh -c ps x|grep Fvwm|sed -e
's!\(.*\)/\(Fvwm[a-zA-Z]\+\).*!AddToMenu ModuleList \2 KillModule \2!'|sort -u'

BTW: I am using fvwm-snap-20040516

Thank you! `grep -v grep' solved the problem!
Now I know the best way to test out PipeRead command stream is:

% exec COMMAND

I agree.

And the button stay pushed until the menu pop down.

Here is my config:
*FvwmButtons: (2x1 Frame 1 Padding 2 0 Title(side) "Start " ,Left, Icon \
linux.png, Action(Mouse 1) 'Menu RootMenu Rectangle +$left+$top 0 -100m')

Any ideas?

BTW: I use fvwm-snap-20040516.

Hi all,

I'm using Fvwm 2.5.9. I just want to change the button look after maximizing 
the window. I've read the FAQ and the manpages but I haven't found the 
answer. Any ideas?

Is there a limit of one DynamicPopupAction per menu? I tried using two
and it seems that the second one effectively deletes the first one. 

As an example I have two simple scripts

% showrecent
DestroyMenu recreate "Recent"
AddToMenu "Recent" "Recent Applications" Title

% showrecentdocs
DestroyMenu recreate "EmacsDocs"  
AddToMenu "EmacsDocs" "Emacs Documents%emacs.png%" Title

(not useful, but enough to see if it will work)

The menu is defined as :
AddToMenu   Applications
+ "Applications%package_applications.png%"        	Title
+ "Most Recent &Documents...%emacs.png%"        	Popup EmacsDocs
+ DynamicPopupAction Piperead showrecentdocs
+ "&Most Recent...%package_applications.png%"         	Popup Recent
+ DynamicPopupAction Piperead showrecent

In this case I see all the menu options, but only the second one pops
up. If I reverse the order, then the other one pops up instead.

Is this a limitation or am I doing something stupid?

Regards,

Chris

Please, add commas, make the life of everyone (including yourself) easier.

  *FvwmButtons: (2x1, Frame 1, Padding 2 0, Title(side) "Start ", ...)

Searching for "popup" in FvwmButtons man page returns the answer.

In the example above, you may just replace "Menu" with "Popup" and
it will work as in fvwm itself, or you may add ", ActionOnPress" to
get an alternative behaviour.

Mikhael.

Yes, there is one DynamicPopupAction per menu.

Just create 2 submenus and define DynamicPopupAction for each one.

Sorry, I did not write clearly in my previous post.
Let me sort this out.
       +------------------------------------------------------+
 fig1: |Start|                                                |
       +------------------------------------------------------+
I want to create a taskbar using FvwmButtons.
The taskbar has a `Start' button (fig1) in its left.
When I click `Start', the root menu is poped up. I want
the `Start' button remain DEPRESSED (although the mouse button 
is already released) while root menu is open.
When the root menu pops down, the `Start' button restored.

KDE kicker's start button has this feature.

Since I added "Style * MwmButtons" all works fine except that the state of

Why? Any ideas?

If you use Windows-like buttons, then redefine button hints:

     ButtonStyle 1 - MwmDecorMenu
     ButtonStyle 6 - MwmDecorMin
     ButtonStyle 4 - MwmDecorMax

This is copied from FAQ, as part of another question, but this probably
deserves its own question.

Mikhael.

Yes, you also need this line:

  ButtonStyle 2 - Clear

I will rework FAQ here.

Do you have "Style * MwmButtons" somewhere?

Hello,

I want to configure fvwm so that new windows would be
automatically maximized.

Obviously, the way to achieve this is by using the FvwmEvent module.
I tried to put the following in .fvwm2rc:

Module FvwmEvent
*FvwmEvent: map Maximize

but it doesn't works.

Why is that, and what can I do to get the desired effect?

ddtl.

Hello,

I have found a bug in FvwmConsole module, and would like to
report it. Am I to report it as a usual bug (to fvwm-workers)
or do I have to send it to the module's author (and if so-where to?)

ddtl.

I want to use mouse strokes for fvwm.  I downloaded fvwm and installed
the rpm and it went fine, I downloaded all the particulars (libstroke,
xpm, etc.).  I have a .fvwm2rc file and put in the mouse strokes.  But
when I run fvwm the mouse strokes don't work.  I read that you need to
compile fvwm with stroke support.  So I downloaded the source for fvwm
and to compile there is an option to compile with libstroke support. 
But I can't seem to locate where the libstroke is installed, I just
installed the libstroke-0.4-1mdk.  Do I need to also download and
compile libstroke as well?

I am not sure what I need to do to get fvwm working with stroke support.

Thanks for any help.

You'll need the source to fvwm (which you have) and the "devel" RPM for
libstroke.

fvwm-workers is the authors/maintainers of all shipped modules.

You may see FAQ on the web, #5.3  How do I submit a bug report?

Thanks Thomas, I can't seem to get the strokes to work from my fvwm2rc
file.  Is there a sample file that includes strokes?  This is what I
have in fvwm2rc file but this doesn't seem to work for strokes.  It just
does standard right click showing the menus.

It's attached below under the section for mouse strokes:

# Unfortunately, order does matter in this file
# The correct order for inserting configurations is:
# 1. Colors
# 2. Assorted configuration paramters such as ClickToFocus, or
MWMBorders
# 3. Path setup (ModulePath, PixmapPath, IconPath)
# 4. Style settings, including the default style Style "*" ...
# 5. InitFunction and ResetFunction definitions.
# 6. Other Functions. Functions cannot be forward referenced from
#	other functions, but they can be backward referenced.
# 7. Menus definitions. Same caveats about forward referencing
# 8. Key and Mouse Bindings.
# 9. Module options.

# The order of steps 5, 6, and 7 is not critical, as long as there are
# no forward references to functions or menus.

# If you get it wrong, the most common problem is that color or font
settings

I use fvwm 2.5.10 (from Debian unstable), .fvwm2rc is at
the end of the post (without menu definitions & key bindings,
as they are not important)

>>and what can I do to get the desired effect?

Unfortunately an examples from FAQ don't work (though I have to
admit that I didn't look at the FAQ before posting, my fault):

I copy-pasted the last two examples (for versions 2.3.21 to 2.4.15
and for 2.5.7+ and 2.4.16+) into .fvwm2rc and restarted fvwm,
but didn't get the advertized effect (i.e., pointer wrapping to
the newly created windows.)

Here is my config file (after reading FAQ i have changed
a couple of things in FvwmEvent, and included both "map" and
"add_window" events, but still it doesn't work):

-------------------------------------------------------------------

DeskTopSize 1x1

IgnoreModifiers L25

DefaultFont "-microsoft-verdana-medium-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-koi8-*"

Style * ClickToFocus, BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4, NoIcon

MenuStyle * PopupImmediately, PopdownImmediately, PopupOffset 0 100,\
	    SeparatorsLong, TrianglesSolid

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: map Maximize
*FvwmEvent: add-window Maximize

I can't reproduce any problem, both "map" and "add_window" work for me.

Maybe you had a copy/paste problem. Try to copy line by line
(without leading spaces and trailing end of lines) into FvwmConsole.
Remove "AddToFunc StartFunction I " bit if you paste into FvwmConsole.

Both examples work perfectly for me.

It is "add_window" in both FAQ and man page, not "add-window".
Other than this, the window is maximized several times for me,
because new windows get one add_window event and two map events.

Mikhael.

Did you use the same configuration for FvwmEvent as I did, i.e.
(changed add-window to add_window here):

-----------------------------------------
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: add_window Maximize

DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent
-----------------------------------------

If yes, then maybe it is a problem with Debian's package and I will
try to ask some Debian users who use the same version to check whether
they encounter the same problem using those options...

Yes, I did. Copy-paste the following lines into FvwmConsole. They should
work for 2.5.10. I don't think Debian package may somehow break this.

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent: add_window Maximize
KillModule FvwmEvent
FvwmEvent

Is it possible you just destroy StartFunction later in your config?
Are you sure you don't run an incorrect fvwm executable?

Mikhael.

All,

Is there a way to reference a window by something other than it's name? 
Like a window class or something?

I'd like to force my icons of a certain class to minimize to a certain
location on my desktop...

Thanks.

So what would a Style line referencing a window by one of these look like?

Yes, you may reference a window by either window name, class or resource
in Style or conditional commands.

It is also possible to refer to a window by its id in WindowId
conditional (as well as to change the style using WindowStyle command
in 2.5.x).

No, I don't destroy it - actually, I have added StartFunction function 
to the config file only for the sake of FvwmEvent module.

Also, when I run FvwmConsole (I have a shortcut key for that purpose)
it says Fvwm 2.5.10, so it seems that it is a correct executable.

Maybe Debian's patch modifies something - it (the patch) is quite
large (200 Kb), and though I couldn't find that it modifies
the code itself, maybe some settings were affected.
After all, there should be some reason for that behavior.

ddtl.

Great.  Is there an easy way to add style-like options based on WindowId?

I tried...

Style "0x1a00003" CascadePlacement

...with no luck.

Thanks.

I still can't seem to get mouse stroke to work.  Does someone have a
sample fvwm2rc file that works with mouse strokes?  I keep getting
errors with my fvwm2rc file.

Thanks.

If it helps, I am running fvwm 2.4.17 and using Red Hat Linux 9.0.

Thanks for any help.

First, CascadePlacement works for new windows, it makes no much sense to
change the placement policy of existing windows. Such change affects one
PlaceAgain command. Is this what you need?

Second, if you reread what I said, Style does not work with ids; WindowId
and WindowStyle do. Please refer to the man page. It is:

  WindowId 0x1a00003 WindowStyle CascadePlacement

However you normally never need to use WindowId directly (unless you
restore previously stored id), you need one or another conditional
command producing window context, like:

  All ("Mozilla") WindowStyle CascadePlacement

But again, CascadePlacement option is not something you want to configure
this way, you probably just want:

  Style "Mozilla" CascadePlacement

Mikhael.

Did you try the file I suggested?

Start FvwmConsole and type these commands in it:

Mouse         3  R  A   StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2
Stroke  0     0  R  A   Exec xmessage "Just click mouse 3 on the root"
Stroke  N852  0  R  A   Exec xterm -n "Draw line from up to down"
Stroke  N456  0  R  A   Exec xterm -n "Draw line from left to right"

Mikhael.

Well, this is pretty easy to verify. Download and unpack the sources and
issue these 2 commands, "./configure --prefix /tmp/fvwm; make install".
Then type in FvwmConsole: Restart /tmp/fvwm/bin/fvwm    # -f /dev/null

I see no way for FvwmEvent not to work unless you have a limit on number
of processes or something weird and unlikely like this.

Other tips to try is to watch X output stream for errors, remove
ModulePath (which you say you don't have), setup other events like:
*FvwmEvent: raise_window Echo "raise window"

Mikhael.

Sorry to be ignorant, but when I right click with my mouse on the root
window (the background of my desktop which is in a VNC viewer), I only
see the standard menu of the GNOME window manager (New Windows, New
Folder, etc.).  

Unless this is not called the root window, then what is the root window?

Thanks and sorry to sound ignorant, I am new to FVWM.

Gnome runs something called Nautilus.
This creates a borderless window that covers the root window.

You can stop using nautilus or invoke your fvwm menus some other way.

You must be new.

Replies belong "in context" on this list.

Normally, I just delete top posted messages.
I don't know how many other people on this list do the same
but it could be a non-zero number.

Or, choose the "third way"! :)

Change your key and mouse click to accept both "R" (root window) AND "D"
(desktop application).  So:

  >> > Mouse         3  R  A   StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2
  >> > Stroke  0     0  R  A   Exec xmessage "Just click mouse 3 on the root"

  >> > Stroke  N456  0  R  A   Exec xterm -n "Draw line from left to right"

Mouse         3  RD  A   StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2
Stroke  0     0  RD  A   Exec xmessage "Just click mouse 3 on the root"
Stroke  N852  0  RD  A   Exec xterm -n "Draw line from up to down"
Stroke  N456  0  RD  A   Exec xterm -n "Draw line from left to right"


See the documentation of the "Mouse" option in the fvwm man page.

Note you need a sufficiently new version of FVWM (I don't remember
whether this is implemented in 2.4.x).

Well, strange things happen... I compiled/installed fvwm as you have
said, ran "/tmp/fvwm/bin/fvwm --replace" (from xterm), and everything
started working as it should. But then, I killed X, removed /tmp/fvwm
and restarted X, being sure that I have found a bug (in the package), but
to my amazement everything *still* continued to work (before running
newly compiled fvwm, FvwmEvent didn't work, and I didn't touch
any config files).

I thought that maybe somehow the old fvwm/FvwmEvent were overwritten
in the process, but no, "ls -l" shows that it is not the case.

I am curious what could have caused it - in order to compile fvwm
I had to install a lot of new packages, so maybe it has to do something
with that - does fvwm exectuable/FvwmEvent module have some external
dependencies which, if lacking, won't prevent them from running, but
will cause some features not to work?

Don't know what/whether to report it to the maintainer of the package.


ddtl.

Hi,

I want to create a function that moves a window to the next/previous page. For 
example, if the current Page is 0 1 I want the window to be moved to 
Page 0 2.

Any ideas?

Try this (it requires FvwmPerl and assumes a 4x4 grid):

DestroyFunc MoveWindowToNextPage
AddToFunc MoveWindowToNextPage
+		I	WindowId ${w.id} MoveToPage \
		%{ ${page.nx} < 3 ? ${page.nx} + 1 : \
			${page.ny} < 3 ? 0 : 3 }% \
                %{ ${page.nx} < 3 ? ${page.ny} : \
			${page.ny} < 3 ? ${page.ny} + 1 : 3 }%

This should consider 3,3 as the "last page" and not try to move a window
on beyond it. By changing both occurrences of ': 3 }%' to ': 0 }%', you
could make the "next page" from 3,3 wrap around to 0,0.

I tried this but it doesn't work. I added

+ I Module FvwmPerl 

to my init function. And I tested whether it works if I add

+ I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c

to the MoveWindowToNextPage function. I had no luck.

Thanks.

Any ideas?

Yes, the sample above, although an ok idea, is just incorrect.
Good you figured out how to pass it to a preprocessing.
You should also replace every ${var} with correct $[var].

This sample should work:

  Module FvwmPerl

  DestroyFunc .
  AddToFunc   .
  + I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*

  DestroyFunc MoveWindowToRightPage
  AddToFunc   MoveWindowToRightPage
  + I . MoveToPage %{ $[page.nx]+1 == $[desk.pagesx] ? 0 : $[page.nx]+1 }% 0p

And if you don't want to loop, then a simple "MoveToPage +1p 0p" will do
what you want.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This also doesn't work. I think that MoveToPage has to be invoked either by

MoveToPage 1 2

or 

MoveToPage +1p 0p.

In your sample you seem to use the two possibilities together. But even when I 
trie it with 

+ I . MoveToPage %{ $[page.nx]+1 == $[desk.pagesx] ? 0 : $[page.nx]+1 }%  1

it doesn't work.

I know, but I want, for example, move from Page 2 0 to Page 0 1 (3x2 desk).

True, you should use $[page.ny] instead of 0p above.

I hope you have a recent fvwm version. It should work, but it asks for a
window to select, this is a general problem of SendToModule loosing the
window context, so you may need the WindowId trick below.

Please next time explain exactly what is "next page" for you, so we don't
need to guess. If I understand it correctly, then one of the solutions is:

+ I . WindowId $[w.id] MoveToPage \
      %{ $[page.nx] + 1 < $[desk.pagesx] ? $[page.nx] + 1 : 0 }% \
      %{ $[page.nx] + 1 < $[desk.pagesx] ? $[page.ny] : \
         $[page.ny] + 1 < $[desk.pagesy] ? $[page.ny] + 1 : 0 }%

But maybe the "next page" for you is not from the current page, but from
the window's page, then you should play with window coordinates $[w.x],
$[vp.width] and Move, not with MoveToPage.

Regards,
Mikhael.

# Ctrl-Alt-Left and Right to move a window to the previous or next page
Key   Left      A     CM    MoveToPage 0p -1p
Key   Right     A     CM    MoveToPage 0p +1p

Don't think it'll handle wrap arounds tho.

Hi there, I'm using an application that has a very annoying habit of making
Transient windows that GrabFocus regardless of my settings. No combination
of Style settings seems to disable it, even NeverFocus, I've tried:

Style Waiting !FPGrabFocusTransient, !FPGrabFocus, !FPFocusByProgram,
!FPLenient, NeverFocus

with no luck, after a bit of investigation it seems the app calls
XSetInputFocus() itself when it wants attention..arghh! Is there anyway I
can prevent these windows from stealing focus?

According to the man page XSetInputFocus() will only work on visible
windows, so I've temporarily solved it by using StartsOnDesk -99,
SkipMapping. Is this the best/only way?

Actually, i decided to LD_PRELOAD away it's XSetInputFocus and XMoveWindow
privileges for now, but i'd still be interested if there is an fvwm-based
solution :)

Thanks.

Hello,

How do I make something like this:
http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/Nuno_Alexandre-1600x1200/screenshot
jpg

I REALY like the icons with the thumbnails of the windows in it, how to do
this? How do I make a menu like that (transparent but tinted, you see the
windows under it!)?

I use FVWM 2.5.7, have not downloaded any patch or FVMW-Themes. I tried the
source of this one:
http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/Tavis_Ormandy-desk-1152x864/screens
hot.jpg

Which also has the nice iconified windows and transparant, but tinted menus,
but turn out as ugly text and the menus aren't transparent :-(

Also how can I make a transparent but tinted (by tinted I mean it has still
a color) pager?

Do I need something special? A patch? A newer version? A better graphics
chip (I have a Cirrus Logic with 1Mb (SLICK!))?

If I need any patch, do I need to compile the thing myself, or can I apply
it to a FreeBSD package?

Regards,
Berry

Hello,

I've been messing with setting up my menu and am mainly courious
what sort of plans for more functaionality will be added to them.

First let me explain what I'm trying to do, I'd like to have some script
similar to fvwm-menu-directory go though my mp3 dir and then add
two actions to each mp3 file, I'd like Mouse 1 to play the mp3 (or mp3
dir) and Mouse 2 to enque the mp3 into xmms. So I would like to bind
different actions in the Menu based upon the button hit.

In looking to see if this is possible I found the following:

1) From the mailing list archives for fvwm-workers@fvwm.org:
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0203/msg00508.html

I really liked this idea of adding a new command to help
with customizing the menu, The basic idea was to keep the
format of 'AddToMenu' the same (for backwards compadibility)
but then add a new command 'AddMenuItems'. This command would
allow you to add (I)tems to the menu and then add (P)roperties
and (A)ctions to that item that could then be effected by the
mouse and or key pressed in the menu.

I've talked to a few people in #fvwm on irc.freenode.net and they all
think the idea is good along with the above thread has mostly positive
comments about it, so I'm courious what ever happend to this idea
and would it be possible to put something like this in there
(or is there something different in the working)


2) Taviso (from #fvwm) said that there is an option in the works
to allow biddings to work inside of windows, (something like)
'Mouse 1 Menu A FvwmFunction'. Now this does look good, but I would
have to write up a little function for it based of the menu item
clicked on to get the desired effect, as it is more a global binding
instead of a binding per item (like above)


3) Another solution which would require the least work from my
point of view would be to extend the options in a standard function.
Right now all I see is '+ I', '+ D', '+ M' and '+ H' as the optoins.
If you added a few more of these say '+ mX' that would mean
do this action if 'mouse button X' was the event then I could
make a function for my purpose, say something like

AddToFunc FvwmPlayXmms
+ m1 <play $0 in xmms>
+ m2 <enque $0 in xmms>



On another note there is one more issue I am having with my menu.
I have it set to 'Hiligh3DOff' which is what I want as I don't want
a hilighted border around my selction (just the text color to change)
This works well except that now if I have a big icon (say a thumbnail
for my wallpaper dir), the Hilight3DThickness was what gave a spacing of
X pixles between the icons (thumbnails), so for my Thumbnails they
all run into eachother (there is no spacing between them). The only
possible things I could find would be to add the MenuStyles
'VerticalItemSpacing X Y' and 'VerticalTitleSpacing X Y' which will add
some virtical spacing between my items (what I want), but from
experimenting with this, the numbers X Y are the spacing above and below
the item based off of the 'text size' and don't take the icon into
account, so to get this to work I have to make X and Y quite large so it
adds the right amount of space to above and below the icons, which makes
it so the places I have smaller icons are still spaced far apart.
My question is am I using this option wrong, or could another optoin be
added to the mix, say 'VirticalIconSpacing X Y' which would put spacing
above and below the icon size on the menu to allow for what I want.


Thank you for your time
jaimos

First I want to thank you for your tips. Now everything works fine except one 
thing. I bound the functions to a mouse click on a button. Now when I click 
on the button it stays pressed in and no action is done until I click on it 
another time. Why?
Here is my configuration:

DestroyFunc .
AddToFunc .
+	  "I"	SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*

DestroyFunc MoveAndGoToPreviousDesk
AddToFunc MoveAndGoToPreviousDesk
+	  "I"	. MoveToDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 0 ? 3 : $[desk.n]-1}%
+	  "I"	. GotoDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 0 ? 3 : $[desk.n]-1}%

DestroyFunc MoveToPreviousDesk
AddToFunc MoveToPreviousDesk
+	  "I"	. MoveToDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 0 ? 3 : $[desk.n]-1}%

DestroyFunc MoveAndGoToNextDesk
AddToFunc MoveAndGoToNextDesk
+	  "I"	. MoveToDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 3 ? 0 : $[desk.n]+1}%
+	  "I"	. GotoDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 3 ? 0 : $[desk.n]+1}%

DestroyFunc MoveToNextDesk
AddToFunc MoveToNextDesk
+	  "I"	. MoveToDesk 0 %{$[desk.n] == 3 ? 0 : $[desk.n]+1}%

DestroyFunc MoveAndGoToPreviousPage
AddToFunc MoveAndGoToPreviousPage
+	  "I"	 . MoveToPage %{$[page.nx] == 0 ? $[desk.pagesx]-1:\
			        $[page.nx]-1}% \
			      %{$[page.nx] > 0 ? $[page.ny]:\
         		        $[page.ny] > 0 ? $[page.ny]-1:\

         		        $[page.ny] > 0 ? $[page.ny]-1:\
				$[desk.pagesy]-1}%

DestroyFunc MoveAndGoToNextPage
AddToFunc MoveAndGoToNextPage
+	  "I"	 . MoveToPage %{$[page.nx]+1 == $[desk.pagesx] ? 0:\
			        $[page.nx]+1}% \
			      %{$[page.nx]+1 < $[desk.pagesx] ? $[page.ny]:\
         		        $[page.ny]+1 < $[desk.pagesy] ? $[page.ny]+1:0}%
+	  "I"	 . GotoPage %{$[page.nx]+1 == $[desk.pagesx] ? 0:\
			        $[page.nx]+1}% \
			      %{$[page.nx]+1 < $[desk.pagesx] ? $[page.ny]:\
         		        $[page.ny]+1 < $[desk.pagesy] ? $[page.ny]+1:0}%

DestroyFunc MoveToNextPage
AddToFunc MoveToNextPage
+	  "I"	 . MoveToPage %{$[page.nx]+1 == $[desk.pagesx] ? 0:\
			        $[page.nx]+1}% \
			      %{$[page.nx]+1 < $[desk.pagesx] ? $[page.ny]:\
         		        $[page.ny]+1 < $[desk.pagesy] ? $[page.ny]+1:0}%

.
.
.

Mouse   1	8	A	Function "MoveAndGoToNextDesk" 
Mouse   3	8	A	Function "MoveToNextDesk" 
Mouse   1	0	A	Function "MoveAndGoToPreviousDesk" 
Mouse   3	0	A	Function "MoveToPreviousDesk"  
Mouse   1	7	A	Function "MoveAndGoToNextPage"
Mouse   3	7	A	Function "MoveToNextPage"
Mouse   1	5	A	Function "MoveAndGoToPreviousPage"
Mouse   3	5	A	Function "MoveToPreviousPage"

Remark: All functions work well and the effect mentioned above appears with 
all functions, too.

Hi,

I have configured FVWM to switch  to the third desktop whenever I launch
Xpdf.

I have  a problem with this  setting since I, sometimes,  read PDF files
into my web browser (ie. Firefox).

In  fact, with  the help  of  mozplugger, I  can see  pdf directly  from
Mozilla.

Now I think  you can see the  problem: mozilla is always put  on the 2nd
desk and so,  FVWM makes me switch to  the 3rd when I try to  open a PDF
file.

How can I prevent  this to occur when I am in mozilla  ? I have tried to
see if  something could be  used to stop  that, but FvwmIdent  and other
don't see this is not a full xpdf running but a swallowed one.

Any idea ?

Regards,

fvwm@fvwm.org got antispammed by our mail system these days.
Forgive me for writing to you directly.

My config:
Mouse 1     TS   A    Move-or-Maximize
AddToFunc Move-or-Maximize
 + I Raise
 + M Move
 + D Maximize

With the above config double-click 
the title will maximize the window.

However the double-click can be Mouse1-Mouse1,
Mouse1-Mouse2 or Mouse1-Mouse3.

I suspect this is a bug.
If not, how can I ensure that only Mouse1-Mouse1
is working?

Thank you for time!

Liu Shidai

If I am not mistaken, what you are looking for is the translucency
patch (translucent windows allow showing windows hidden under them and
I believe this is not yet in FVWM, transparent windows show the
background, but not overlapped windows, that is supported in mainstream
fvwm).

If you get the patch you will need to recompile the package (unless
someone supplies a package with the patch included).

I don't know how your chip will deal with that though (didn't know
there were still 1MB graphic cards out there).

I don't know how things are with freebsd (don't think it has
frame buffer support) but if it does there is DirectFB which allows
translucency (don't know how hard it is to setup).

Hi everyone,

I'm experimenting a bit and gave some names to my desktops, like this:

DesktopName 0 log
DesktopName 1 brow

Now I can display these names, but can I do anything else with them?
Something like "Key 1 A MC GotoDesk 0 log" doesn't work...

TIA

These are desk labels, not alternative ids. Some modules use these labels.

You can't have a number-by-name lookup (the names may even not be
unique), but you may have a name-by-number lookup. Try this, for example:

  AddToMenu SwitchDesk
  + "Goto desk $[desk.name0]" GotoDesk 0
  + "Goto desk $[desk.name1]" GotoDesk 1
  + "Goto desk $[desk.name2]" GotoDesk 2
  + "Goto desk $[desk.name3]" GotoDesk 3

Mikhael.

That is correct....the patch was on the list a long time ago....dont
know where it is now but I think it was called the translucent menu's
patch.

As far as graphics cards go, mine is nothing special and it works just
fine

I never saw the mozplugger+xpdf, so I may only guess. Do you mean the
xpdf is started on desk 3 and then mozilla on desk 2 swallows it?

If so, this line may help, I think:

  Style Xpdf SkipMapping

If you still want to go to desk 3 when you start xpdf from a menu, then
create a function to start it, similar the one from FAQ #3.18.

Mikhael.

Communications Research to Initiate Marketing of
TeleWRITER at Upcoming InfoComm Conference
----------------------------------------------------

Reasons to own CRHI.OB:

TeleWRITER has not been upgraded for over 5 years but
nonetheless still commands a very loyal following.
Communications Research acquired the software 2 years
ago and will have its upgrade completed just in time
for InfoComm. Beta testing will begin almost immediately
and sales are expected to kick off in October. TeleWRITER
sales will add considerably and immediately to the company's
bottom line. CRHI's Systems Integration division is also
performing above expectations and they have recently hired
a number of contract employees to assist the company on
fulfillment.

Communications Research to Initiate Marketing of TeleWRITER
at Upcoming InfoComm Conference.

MAHWAH, N.J., May 18, 2004 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) --
Communications Research, Inc. (CRHI) announced that it will
begin marketing TeleWRITER 3.0, the upgraded version of the
TeleWRITER product line, at InfoComm June 9-11, 2004 in
Atlanta, Georgia. TeleWRITER is a premier product in the
collaborative computing market, which is pegged at in excess
of 3 billion this year.

"We have been receiving numerous requests for the upgrade
and are on the verge of being able to supply the pent-up
demand for our product," remarked Communications Research
CEO Carl Ceragno. "InfoComm affords us the opportunity of a
huge industry event at which to make a big splash and to let
the industry know we're back with a vengeance. TeleWRITER's
feature rich software, low price point and ease of
interoperability should make it a huge hit in the burgeoning
distant learning and tele-commuting markets. We anticipate
quickly re-capturing former clients and rapidly developing
new sales to catapult the company."



   DON'T DELAY GET CRHI.OB TODAY FOR BIG GAINS MONDAY!

Maybe it is possible to reproduce the problem by installing
the minimal Debian system (from stable distribution) and then
using apt-get to install fvwm from unstable, so that only minimal
dependencies for fvwm would be met - that is what I did.
By minimal I mean only enough packages to reboot successfully.

But in order to do this, there is a need to reformat a HD
to get a clean slate, and having only one HD to experiment
on, and as I already spent a lot of time customizing my system
I don't really want to do this.

Anyway, if nobody else had reported the problem it is
probably not worth the effort.

AFAIK, there is nothing wrong with the debian package, and I use
FvwmEvent extensively.

Furthermore, your ideas for re-installing are a bit rash. if it _is_
just a case of wanting to install the base-system, just create a chroot
jail for it.

Hello,

when I have my own made theme running with premade icons downloaded from
www.kde-look.org it doesn't take much processor usage, ~3% according to
gkrellm. But then I added the future off the thumbnail icons, and it seems
that since than the processor is constandly using ~90%, even when there are
no icons. What can the problem be?

regards,
Berry

Hello,

I have a function bound to the destroy_window event, whose purpose is to 
focus another window automatically.  I would like it to only do this if 
the window being closed is not transient.  Here is my original, which 
works except that it does not distinguish between transients and 
non-transients:

#---------------------------------\
DestroyFunc CycleLocally
AddToFunc CycleLocally
+ "I"           Next (CurrentDesk, !Sticky) \
			Function FocusAndRaise
+ "I"           TestRC (0) Next (!Sticky) \
			Function FocusAndRaise

*FvwmEvent: destroy_window \
	'Function CycleLocally'
#------------------------------------/


So, I tried this modification:

#----------------------------------\
*FvwmEvent: destroy_window \
	'Current (!Transient) Function CycleLocally'
#----------------------------------/

But that didn't work; the event seems to be called *after* the window has 
disappeared.

How can I do this?

Thanks,
- --

Looks like some commands stay running after making a mini icon, but are
detached from X-server forcibly i.e. by closing connection on fvwm side.
This happens to, for example, xmms and some other apps if you kill them with
xkill. Thus they may be doing polls and such that loads your CPU. Launch a
'ps wax' command and grep for leftover commands like 'convert' or whatever
you launch to make miniicons. If they really stay you should debug fvwm
function making miniicons to not to leave them running.

First, if you want to work on a correct window, never use Current with
FvwmEvent (unless you want to always work on the focused window that may
or may not be the window caused the event). Just call the needed command,
it will be executed under the context of the original window, or use
ThisWindow conditional. I.e. one of these:

  *FvwmEvent: add_window Iconify

  *FvwmEvent: add_window 'ThisWindow (!Transient) Iconify'

  *FvwmEvent: destroy_window 'ThisWindow (!Transient) CycleLocally'

> But that didn't work; the event seems to be called *after* the window has

Just tried, although you can't iconify (or move for example) a window
being destroyed, you may still access all its properties. (But you may
iconify or move a different window on destroy_window event of course.)

Mikhael.

Hi all,

I want to bind a special key (C-Left) to _one_ application.

C-Left,C-Right and so on, are used by fvwm2 to move through windows in 
my desktop.

But, for a peculiar case, I want to rebind C-Left (Go To Previous View) 
only to one application, acroread for instance, because I can't bind 
special key for it, even in looking in 
Acrobat5/Reader/intellinux/app-defaults...

I'm thinking about hack a "MyMove" function, that should effectively 
move window if mouse/pointer is not on an application such acroread.
How can I do this ?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

-- 
Fred.

Hi Fred,

> I want to bind a special key (C-Left) to _one_ application.

This will be possible once my window-specific bindings patch
is committed. (When oh when will that be?)

Until then, all key/mouse bindings are global. (ie. apply to _all_
windows.)

SCoTT. :)

Acrobat Reader is a Motif application. Theoretically it is possible to
modify the bindings. See man page for VirtualBindings if you have Motif
installed or
http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V51B_HTML/MAN/MAN3/=
0187___X.HTM

Also when Motif is installed on one system it creates a file which
maps the actual key names to the osf ones. (I don't recall the name
of this file).=20

Maybe some info later when i get home.

Last week I submitted a patch to create a new style, CenterPlacement.  I
didn't see any comments about it and I don't see the changes in the CVS
sources, so I'm wondering if there was something wrong with the way that
I submitted my patch?

I've checked the FAQ, but there's nothing in it about submitting
patches.

Just curious.

Hi everyone

I have an app - multi-gnome-terminal - that can be started up in two
modes - 'factory' or 'client'. I want the first instance started of this
app to always be the 'factory', and all other instances to be the
'clients' ( doing it this way reduces memory usage ).

Unfortunately, this app is not intuitive enough to start a 'factory' if
one doesn't exist, and to connect to one if it does, with the same
command. Therefore I need to write a function to invoke this app that
checks if the 'factory' is running, and invokes it if it is not, and
invokes the 'client' if the factory is running ie

if (an instance of multi-gnome-terminal is running)
   # Start client
   Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --use-factory
else
   # Start factory
   Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --start-factory-server
fi

xwininfo gives the following :

xwininfo: Window id: 0x1e00011 "MGT - [ 1-Shell ]"

so, in an attempt to begin solving this, I created the following
function :

DestroyFunc FuncStartMGT
AddToFunc   FuncStartMGT
+ I WindowId $0 ("MGT*") Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --use-factory

I use the * above because the name of this window changes, but always
begins with MGT. This would hopefully start my 'client' if an instance
of multi-gnome-terminal was already started. Unfortunately this does not
work.

I also tried this line in the function above to start the 'factory' if
no instance of multi-gnome-terminal was running :

+ I WindowId $0 ("MGT") (!CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk)     Exec exec
multi-gnome-terminal --start-factory-server

This doesn't work either. 

I'm considering using PipeRead to call a script that does a ps to check
for an instance of multi-gnome-terminal, and that returns the applicable
parameters, but I was wondering if there was a native fvwm solution to
replicate the pseudo-code 'if' statement above?

BTW I'm running fvwm 2.5.8.

Thanks

Hi Stuart,

: Therefore I need to write a function to invoke this app that
: checks if the 'factory' is running, and invokes it if it is not, and
: invokes the 'client' if the factory is running

This should work, but I haven't tested it:

AddToFunc FuncStartMGT
+ I Any (MGT*) Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --use-factory
+ I None (MGT*) Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --start-factory-server

: I'm considering using PipeRead to call a script that does a ps to check
: for an instance of multi-gnome-terminal, and that returns the applicable
: parameters

Yeah, that would work too:

PipeRead `if /sbin/pidof multi-gnome-terminal >& /dev/null ; then echo Exec exec  multi-gnome-terminal --use-factory ; else echo Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --start-factory-server ; fi`

SCoTTie! :)

Thanks Tavis. I added a * to (MGT) and it works perfectly.

Have you considered using a wrapper script?  This is what I do with
Mozilla.  If there is no Mozilla process running, my wrapper launches
Mozilla; if Mozilla is already running, then the wrapper sends a command
to the running Mozilla process using the -remote interface to perform
the requested action.

I did try that. Didn't succeed but was getting there before I adopted
this solution below, provided by Tavis :

AddToFunc StartMgt
+ I Any (MGT*)       Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal --use-factory
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Exec exec multi-gnome-terminal \
                                           --start-factory-server

This works very well BUT, *blush* I have since discovered that if one
starts MGT like this :

multi-gnome-terminal --start-factory-server --use-factory

it IS intuitive enough to figure out what to do. Pity the man page
makes this fact as obscure as possible without hiding it completely.

Still, a good fvwm learning experience once again :)

I want a small border around my windows (Width 2). But then it is
very difficult to resize a window with the mouse.
Is it possible to create a small border but set a larger area for
the mouse?

See FAQ #3.18. The function that maximizes windows is Maximize.

Hello,

I've revamped my .fvwm2rc as to make the borders big (and beautiful).  My
only issue is that when I shade the window, it looks kind of dumb.  Is
there any way to change the border/handle width settings of a window
depending on whether or not it is shaded?


On a similar note, I've been trying to get a titlebar double click to 
un/shade a window.  Why doesn't this work:

#-------------------------.fvwm2rc-
DestroyFunc ShadeOnDblClick
AddToFunc ShadeOnDblClick
+ "D"		WindowShade

Mouse 1 T A 	Function ShadeOnDblClick
#----------------------------------

thanks,

Sorry, if this is a newbie Q. Been aware from fvwm for about 5 years and 
am still trying to get my head back into its config space.

Is there a why to have a FvwmButton change virtual desktops via a button 
click? If I could "theme" the button that would be great too.

TIA

No, that is not possible (as far as I know).

It is possible to create a key or mouse binding that will
initiate a resize from anwhere in the window, the title, or on the root,
or use a menu to initiate the resize.

Resizes that are started outside the context of the window
want you to click first to indicate which window you want to resize.

You can change the Style of windows based of its name, class or resource
string, which can almost do the effect you are looking for....
example

AddToFunc FvwmShade
+ I WindowShade
+ I ThisWindow (Shaded) Style $[w.name] BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0
+ I ThisWindow (!Shaded) Style $[w.name] BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5

you can replace $[w.name] with $[w.class] or $[w.resource], and this
will make the shaded window have no border width, the downside to this
is it will affect all windows of that name, class or resources, which
may not be what ya want...

This function of course affects all windows with the same name/class
(think multiple xterms).

In 2.5.x, use "WindowStyle" instead of "Style $[w.name]" to avoid this.

This sample works without any problems for me. Is it possible, you define
something like "Mouse 0 TSFW A Something" later in the config?

Of course, I would extend this function to be more functional, like:

  + C Raise
  + M Move
  + H Move

I tried fvwm-snap-20040529.
And I'm pretty sure that doubleclick still doesn't work the right way.

My settings:
 AddToFunc Move-or-Maximize
 + I Raise
 + M Move
 + D Maximize
 Mouse 1     TS   A    Move-or-Maximize

I can still click mouse1 with any other second mouse button to maximize the
window.

You need a more recent snapshot.  The snapshots are generated only
once per day.

Hello-
I've been reading the man doc[s] and using FVWM for about 3 months, but 
I've yet to figure out what this one part of my screen is.
Description-
Usually appears in upper left corner
Contains| a pager-element, eyes thingy, a clock, a fvwm box, a SuSe box, 
a Graphics box, a Tools box, and a shell box
Mr. Alpine suggested that I look at pstree to see what/where these were 
but I couldn't translate what that command gave me into how to delete, 
change, this batch of stuff.
Mainly I end up shrinking it but that's really not elegant.
So, what's that part called?  And then perhaps I can deal with it.
Thanks-Jay
