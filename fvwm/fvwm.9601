I'm using m4 to an almost obscene degree (according to my workmates :-)

Your code looks fine, and I can't at first glance see much wrong with
it, but a few things need clarifying.

The m4_* forms imply that you're using gnu m4, and invoking it
with the -P option, i.e. your .xsession/.xinitrc starts fvwm2
with something like:

fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 -m4prog g4 -m4-prefix .fvwm2rc"

(I have gnu m4 installed as `g4', and the `-m4-prefix' switch not only
tells FvwmM4 to pass g4 the -P switch, but also to pass in the prologue
as `m4_define(...) etc. instead of just `define(...))


How do you know what FvwmM4 is defining HOSTNAME to be?

I have the following:

m4_define(`BASEHOSTNAME',m4_substr(HOSTNAME, 0, m4_index(HOSTNAME, .)))

AddToMenu "FvwmInfo" "Constants Known to FVWM" Title
m4_define(`ShowValue', `AddToMenu "FvwmInfo" "`$1' is $1" Nop')
ShowValue(`WIDTH')
ShowValue(`HEIGHT')
ShowValue(`TWM_TYPE')
ShowValue(`SERVERHOST')
ShowValue(`CLIENTHOST')
ShowValue(`HOSTNAME')
ShowValue(`BASEHOSTNAME')
ShowValue(`OSTYPE')
ShowValue(`USER')
ShowValue(`VERSION')
ShowValue(`REVISION')
ShowValue(`VENDOR')
ShowValue(`RELEASE')
ShowValue(`X_RESOLUTION')
ShowValue(`Y_RESOLUTION')
ShowValue(`PLANES')
ShowValue(`BITS_PER_RGB')
ShowValue(`CLASS')
ShowValue(`COLOR')
ShowValue(`FVWM_VERSION')
ShowValue(`OPTIONS')
ShowValue(`FVWMDIR')

Then just pop up the FvwmInfo Menu as you wish.


There exists the `dnl' macro, invoked in your case as `m4_dnl'
which will discard all subsequent text up to and including the
next new line, so I have:

PixmapPath m4_dnl
/home/bill/lib/images/icons/xpm:m4_dnl
/home/bill/trees:m4_dnl
/vol/images/3d_pixmaps_1.0/3dpixmaps_100colors

which looks a little prettier than one long line.


Persevere with m4. It's well worth the effort of learning, and 
you can get a *lot* more out of it than cpp (for example recursive
macros, macros which define macros, macro stacks etc. etc. etc.)

Hope this helps.


Cheers

This line is OK.

This is where it falls down. Putting quotation marks around HOSTNAME
prevents m4 from interpreting it. As used here, it will always compare
the literal string "HOSTNAME" to the literal string "imrryr".

If you remove the quotation marks from HOSTNAME, the ifelse statement
works. This is also true for the second ifelse statement you described.

> Is there any way to make those m4 definitions "prettier"?

If it's not enclosed in quotation marks, you can put newlines where
you wish (after a comma, for example).

-lX11 should appear after ../../libs/libfvwm2.a

Howdy all.

I'm back from vacation (and none too happy about that, I might add).

I have lots of mail from the FVWM list to wade through, and I'll
hopefully have 2.0.41 ready in a few days with some of the patches
that people have sent to me that I neglected to get into 2.0.40, and
fixing whatever problems appeared w/ 2.0.40....

Oh, and Happy New Year.  Welcome to 1996 - may we all live to see
1997. ;^)

The solution is to put -lX11 after the local lib.  I doubt this is

Edit the fvwm/Makefile to change the order of the libraries to this:

Most likely not, as others have reported it as well.  It will
hopefully be fixed for the next release.

Has ClickToFocus been done away with? I can't seem to get it to work with 2.0
and really miss it.

Well, I've finally upgraded to fvwm2 but for some strange reason my icons 
were not loading for the iconified windows. After some investigation I 
found out that a trailing space in the Icon Style definition was being 
added to the name of the pixmap.

Style "xterm" Icon xterm.xpm 
                            ^ space here

I'm submitting a simple patch which fixes this problem.

Has anyone else noticed that if you hold down the mouse button for exactly
the right amount of time on say a title bar, and then release the button,
and then move the mouse, fvwm will drag the window anyway and not release
the drag until you click again?

The timing is very important for this, unfortunately I seem to be physically
tuned to do it exactly right quite often.  It seems to be that clicking very
quickly avoids the problem, and it doesn't happen once the mouse has turned
into the four-way-move pointer, but if I release the mouse button JUST
BEFORE the circle changes to a four-way-move the problem shows up.

This has really annoyed me, particularly since I use a single-click to
deiconify windows and quite often end up dragging the icons around by
accident instead.

This has been around from at least 2.0.36 (first 2.0 version I tried) to my
current version, 2.0.39.  It didn't happen to me in fvwm 1.24r (and still
doesn't).  It's the only thing preventing my full enjoyment of fvwm2 :)

Other interesting information: Linux 1.3.52 (also tried many other versions
including the "stable" 1.2.13), XFree86 3.1.2 (X11R6) with Mach64, S3, and
SVGA servers.  Not using emulate3buttons or chordmiddle.  In other programs,
including fvwm1, my mouse buttons all work fine.  Tried on a 486-33, 486-40,
Pentium-75, and Pentium-133 running fvwm both across the network and on the
local machine with the same effects.

Any ideas?

I've noticed this before, but never debugged it. It is annoying. I believe 
that I have finally located the problem. Its in complex.c. Routine IsClick()
checks to see if we have a mouse move or a click:

Bool IsClick(int x,int y,unsigned EndMask, XEvent *d)
{
  int xcurrent,ycurrent,total = 0;
  Time t0;
  extern Time lastTimestamp;

  xcurrent = x;
  ycurrent = y;
  t0 = lastTimestamp;

  while((total < Scr.ClickTime)&&
        (x - xcurrent < 3)&&(x - xcurrent > -3)&&
        (y - ycurrent < 3)&&(y - ycurrent > -3))
    {
      sleep_a_little(10000);
      total+=10;
      if(XCheckMaskEvent (dpy,EndMask, d))
        {
          StashEventTime(d);
          if((lastTimestamp - t0) < Scr.ClickTime)
            return True;
          else
            return False;
        }
      if(XCheckMaskEvent (dpy,ButtonMotionMask|PointerMotionMask, d))
        {
          xcurrent = d->xmotion.x_root;
          ycurrent = d->xmotion.y_root;
          StashEventTime(d);
        }
    }
  return False;
}

When we get a Button Release, we pass the test:
      if(XCheckMaskEvent (dpy,EndMask, d))
and then check:
          if((lastTimestamp - t0) < Scr.ClickTime)
If we fail the second test, then we discard the button release! (Oops)

This error can be triggered by releasing the mouse just before ClickTime 
expires.

Solutions? One would be to make the click-move decision based on pointer motion
only. Perhaps better would be a re-write from
  while((total < Scr.ClickTime)&&
        (x - xcurrent < 3)&&(x - xcurrent > -3)&&
        (y - ycurrent < 3)&&(y - ycurrent > -3))

to something like:
  while((total < Scr.ClickTime)&&
        (x - xcurrent < 3)&&(x - xcurrent > -3)&&
        (y - ycurrent < 3)&&(y - ycurrent > -3)&&
	(lastTimestamp - t0) < Scr.ClickTime))
and remove the test for expiration time which occurs later:
          if((lastTimestamp - t0) < Scr.ClickTime)

This second solution would probably allow infinite click-times if the
mouse is never moved.

Perhaps the best solution is to try to peek in the event queue without
removing the button release. I think the function XPeekIfEvent might
allow this.

I've noticed a couple of minor irritations when using Tcl/Tk, (both
versions 7.3/3.6 and 7.4/4.0) under fvwm2 which didn't occur with the
version 1 fvwm. Perhaps someonecould look into it?

firstly, with the old fvwm, calling `wm withdraw' would unmap the window
if it was open, or the icon if it was iconified. In fvwm2, if the
window is iconified, the `wm withdraw' command has no effect.

This is slightly irritating because I use the (very good) TkPostit
replacement for xpostit, and in order to hide all the icons, I have to
de-iconify them first.

Secondly, in some cases, clicking a button on a tk application
which causes the window containing the button to withdraw or exit leaves
the cursor as a dot, and I have to click on the root to return the
cursor to its normal state.

Here Is a script which demonstrates these problems. Note that I get the
`dot' behaviour from the Quit button about once in every 5-10 times:

8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---
#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

button .quit -text quit -command {destroy .}
button .iconify -text {Iconify Demo Window} \
    -command {wm iconify .demowin}
button .deiconify -text {Display Demo Window} \
    -command {wm deiconify .demowin}
button .withdraw -text {Withdraw Demo Window} \
    -command {wm withdraw .demowin}

pack .quit .iconify .deiconify .withdraw

toplevel .demowin
label .demowin.img -text {A Demonstration Window}

pack .demowin.img

wm title . {Main Window}
wm title .demowin {Demo Window}
8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---

Above and beyond all that, Fvwm is by far the best WM I've used, and I
don't want my little problems to detract from what is really an excellent
package. Keep up the good work.


Cheers

This is a long shot, but I'm hoping there are some people out there
using fvwm under IRIX 5.3 who might know about this.

The X client programs xwsh, wsh, and winterm all seem to set the property:

	WM_ICON_NAME(COMPOUND_TEXT)

which contains the icon title in hex.  xterm, on the other hand, sets

	WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) 

to the icon title in ASCII.  4Dwm (SGI IRIX window manager) correctly
displays the icon titles for xwsh, etc.  But fvwm's icon titles for
these clients are blank!  Is there an easy way to get fvwm to convert
the WM_ICON_NAME(COMPOUND_TEXT) to the icon title and use that instead
of looking for WM_ICON_NAME(COMPOUND_TEXT) (which I'm guessing it's
doing now)?

Any help would be appreciated!

I am using fvwm-2.0.40 on a Sun (Solaris 2.3) and have a problem when
moving a window, usually by clicking the mouse on the _title bar_ and
dragging the window.  When the move cursor hits one of the screen edges,
the move gets frozen/paused at this location for a little while; you can
still move the 4-arrow cursor away from the screen edge with the mouse,
but it takes a while before the actual window starts moving again.  

Turns out that this is related to the EdgeResistance setting (I'm using
1500 50).  I have it set to 1500 because I dislike all the inadvertant
page changes I end up making!  If I reduce this time (to, say, 50), I
don't get this pause on window moves to the screen edge, but I'm always 
changing pages!! 

Has this problem been seen before?  Is there a possible or known fix?  I'm
going to look at the code tonight, but I've never done _any_ X 
programming, so I don't count on finding anything.  But, I'm interested in
learning it!

Thanks for the great window manager!!

Yes, it is.  It sounds like you're only modifying the first parameter,
though.  From the fvwm man page:

       EdgeResistance scrolling moving
              Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport
              by moving the mouse over the edge of the  screen  and  how
              hard  it  should  be to move a window over the edge of the
              screen.

              The first parameter tells  how  milliseconds  the  pointer
              must  spend  on  the screen edge before fvwm will move the
              viewport. This is intended for people who use  "EdgeScroll
              100  100"  but find themselves accidentally flipping pages
              when they don't want to.

              The second parameter tells how many pixels over  the  edge
              of the screen a window's edge must move before it actually
              moves partially off the screen.

Does changing the second parameter do what you want?

The second parameter set to 50 already does exactly what I want it to.  This
parameter specifies essentially how hard it is to move the _edge_ of a window
off the screen.  50 pixels allows me to easily position a window right at the
edge of the screen without it going over. 

The first parameter at 1500 also does what I want it to; I have to place 
the pointer at the edge of the screen for 1.5seconds before the pager 
will move me to the next virtual screen.  This applies to the pointer 
at all times; when not moving windows, when moving windows, etc.  But, 
there is this nagging side effect during a window move.

Try this.... Lets say I want to grab a window by the title bar and move it to
the very top of the current virtual screen.  When I get to the top, the
window I'm moving will stop right at the edge of the screen, as it should. 
However, if I am "careless" and I allow the _pointer_ to touch the top row of
pixels (mouse button still depressed, pointer still a cross-hair type), even
if I _immediately_ release the mouse button and move the pointer away from
the screen edge, I have to wait the 1.5seconds before I am out of the move
operation and can do other operations.  During this time, the pointer does
move away from the edge, but it remains the cross-hair type and the title bar
of the window I was moving remains depressed. 

Since the pointer was moved away from the edge of the screen, the scroll 
resistance timer should be immediately canceled and no longer have any 
effect.  However, it seems to be hanging up the move operation for this 
time.

I hope this clears things up.  

Thanks,

Mike Blatchley

This is because that fvwm doesn't know how to treat CTEXT string. We
"fvwm users' mailing list in japan" already made a patch for handling
CTEXT string, to display Japanese character in fvwm/modules. This
patch uses X11 I18N feature, so fvwm will display whatever languages
locale can handle (if client sets collect value :-p).

as you mention olvwm: how can I reproduce the following olvwm

I drag a window onto the pager and it disappears (the real window),
but the tiny pagerrepresentation appears.

Good way of immediately putting a window on another page/desktop, when
there's no place on the current page.

Just for the record I'm using fvwm 2.0.39 on an Irix 6.0.1 box and
xwsh, etc, display icon titles just fine. I was playing around with
a 5.3 box a few weeks ago and don't remember any problems (though
I could be mistaken ... I mainly use xterms).

I think MB is right. If you make the first parameter big you *might* expect
that it would still be possible to quickly move windows accross viewports
(provided that the second paramter is small), but changing viewports
just for the sake of changing them would be slow and difficult. Fvwm
does not work this way. If you set the first parameter to 2500, there is a
2.5 second delay when moving windows accross the screen border. Since we
are changing viewports, this behavior is consistent with the description, but
is still unexpected, and possibly undesireable, but I'm not sure.

The second parameter was designed to make it easy to line windows up on the 
screen edge, not to make it difficult to change pages. In fact, the second 
parameter kicks in when the moved-window's edge is on the screen edge,
not when the cursor is on the screen edge.

I think MB wants to have the first edge-resistance parameter ignored when
he's moving windows. I don't know if this is generally desireable or not.

Rob

Note: try using this function in place of all your "Move"s:

AddToFunc MoveFunc	"I" EdgeResistance 0 100
+			"I" Move
+			"I" EdgeResistance 1500 100

Which is kinda neat, and does what you want without re-coding fvwm.

Well, I'm _not_ trying to move into the next virtual screen;  just trying to
move the window right to the edge of the screen I'm on.  So, I _don't_ want
the parameter ignored when moving windows.  The problem is, if the mouse
pointer touches the screen edge during the move (happens easily when quickly
moving a window to the top of the screen by dragging the title bar), then the
ScrollResistance timer (in function HandlePaging in file virtual.c) does not
get canceled if the pointer is immediately RETRACTED from the screen edge. 

It looks to me that the XCheckWindowEvent(dpy,Scr.PanFrameXXXXXX.win,
LeaveWindowMask,&Event) events are never being seen when _moving_ a window
and the pointer Leaves the PanFrame windows (remember folks, yesterday I
said I've _never_ done any X programming, so I hope I don't say anything
stupid!).  This event should be seen and cancel the timer if the pointer
is retracted from the screen edge.  I don't know if the PanFrameXXXXX
windows are just not being seen because the window we are moving is on the
top, or what.  So, I modified the HandlePaging function and added a
mouse pointer location check after all the LeaveWindow checks (I have 
added the -->> symbols here only to point out the new lines): 

  total = 0;
  while(total < Scr.ScrollResistance)
    {
      sleep_a_little(10000);
      total+=10;
-->>  /* should I do the XQueryPointer here???  See below */
      if(XCheckWindowEvent(dpy,Scr.PanFrameTop.win,
                           LeaveWindowMask,&Event))
        {
          StashEventTime(&Event);
          return;
        }
      if(XCheckWindowEvent(dpy,Scr.PanFrameBottom.win,
                           LeaveWindowMask,&Event))
        {
          StashEventTime(&Event);
          return;
        }
      if(XCheckWindowEvent(dpy,Scr.PanFrameLeft.win,
                           LeaveWindowMask,&Event))
        {
          StashEventTime(&Event);
          return;
        }      
      if(XCheckWindowEvent(dpy,Scr.PanFrameRight.win,
                           LeaveWindowMask,&Event))
        {
          StashEventTime(&Event);
          return;
        }
      
-->>  XQueryPointer(dpy, Scr.Root, &JunkRoot, &JunkChild,
-->>            &x, &y, &JunkX, &JunkY, &JunkMask);
-->>  
-->>  if(( x >= SCROLL_REGION)&&( x < Scr.MyDisplayWidth-SCROLL_REGION)&&
-->>     ( y >= SCROLL_REGION)&&( y < Scr.MyDisplayHeight-SCROLL_REGION))
-->>    return;
-->>
    }
  
On my quick check last night, this works and properly aborts the timer if the
pointer is retracted from the screen edges when doing a window move. 
However, what happens if in between the XCheckWindowEvent's and my
XQueryPointer, X does detect one of the LeaveWindow events.  The
XCheckWindowEvent will have missed it, but the XQueryPointer+conditional will
catch it and return.  StashEventTime (I'm not even 100% sure what that does)
would never get called for that event since my conditional check can do
nothing but return. Does it put that event in a queue?  Then what would
happen to it?  Is this even an issue?  If so, would it be safer to put the
XQueryPointer right after the 'total+=10;' statement and leave the
conditional check at the bottom (I think probably so). 

Thanks for the input.

It seems that upon startup x windows cannot find my fonts. I need some
guidance in how to tell fvwm where to find these. Or tell to if I even have
them!

StashEventTime just records the time-stamp of an event for use in future
communications with the x server. Since XQueryPointer doesn't return an event,
you don't need to worry about it.

is there any way to use bitmaps as custom title bar icons?
or are we just limited to ButtonSytle + coordinates?

This is due to the order of libraries. Either give the command manually
or edit the Makefile to be like this:


gcc -o fvwm2 -O2 -m486 -ansi     -L/usr/X11R6/lib <... object files...> \
        ../libs/libfvwm2.a -lXpm  -lXExExt -lXext -lX11

Hello Everyone,

This is not related to FVWM, but did someone mention something about a
publicly available spreadsheet for unix machines?  I thought someone on
the list mentioned this a while back.  Does anyone know where to look
for this type of application?



Thanks,

Chad

This one isn't X-based, just tty (ascii).  It works, but isn't near what
you would expect after using something like Quattro or 1-2-3.

If anyone finds one that's an X app, I'm interested as well.

I have one on my hd called 'Wingz'.  As I recall I grabbed it
out of sunsite's incoming when it was announced on

Hi,

I'm trying to run fvwm 1.24 r under Solaris 2.4/X11R6.  I had installed it a
few weeks ago bu I made a typo in the configure.h file and didn't notice until
someone other than me tried to use it.  So I recompile it and installed it but
now, when it runs, I get a white screen.  Everything is running (I'm positive
because I can move windows around and see their border, the shape of the
cursor changes depending on where I am, etc.) but it's all a lovely, bland,
really annoying white.  What I find weird is that the same program runs
properly using the OpenWindows X Server.  But I'm trying to get around that
becaus the Openwin server  uses 10 times more memory.

Has anyone ever seen something like this?  Does anyone have a cure?

Thank you.

hi all....

let first say i really like fvwm2 and what has been done to it but i
have a couple of config questions.....

it used to be that when i was using fvwm 1.2x in the pager menu i had
the name of the xterms show up in the pager window in the particulat
window... example would be that if i had an xv window up it would show
xv in the desktop on the window that was xv... is this possible in
fvwm2 and what is the syntax to get this to happen...

i also used to be able to get the windows to automatically come up i a
virtual desktop and place itself without me having to click the mouse
to place the window... is this possible in fvwm2 and what would be the
syntax to envolk this....

thanks in advance for any help....

I have having a bit of frustration with what Fvwm
recognises as a double click event.  The problems is
I really have to click FAST to get it to register.
I have a function that looks like this:

AddToFunc Control-Box-Func  "I" Raise
+                           "D" Close
+                           "C" Menu Control-Box
+                           "M" Menu Control-Box

The problems is that it is rather difficult to get the
double click (although it does work).  I have the same
problems with double clicking icons to restore them.

Can anyone help out?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I've switched over to fvwm2 and notice that it seems to be designed much
better than the original fvwm. There are, however, a number of suggestions
that I'd like to make for future improvement. I'm sorry if these things are
already possible, if so, perhaps explaining how to do them would be helpful
to many people. I'm also for sending this to a mailing list that I'm not
on; chances are that these things have already been discussed - I don't
see any archives, so I can't check.

First of all, I like the TogglePage clamp. Something that would also be
nice is the ability to either control a button being "pressed in" or better
yet, being able to cycle between pixmaps and the functions assigned to them.
For example, why have a button for both "dial" and "disconnect" when only
one of them is needed at a time.. Another good feature would be the ability
to specify that something being run requires parameters from the user.

Another thing is that when a window is moved (in non-opaque mode) there is
apparently no way to set the color of the "wire frame" of the window that
you see while it's being moved. I have seen several colors being used for
this, but I can't find where to set it.

I have a mail program which pops up a password-prompt window called
"authenticate". Because I have SloppyFocus (wonderful feature, by the
way), I worry about accidently knocking my mouse into another window and
accidently broadcasting my password into an irc window or something. There
is already a "Stays On Top", and I'd swear I've seen something like "stays
focused" but can't find it. The ability to specify that something stays
focused unless the user specifically clicks on another window would not be
widely used, but it would be very reassuring for those who do use it. 

Finally, a number of my friends have mentioned to me that they would like
to be able to focus a window by clicking anywhere inside the window, citing
this as the major reason why they don't use FVWM. If it is possible to
implement, this would definately be a widely used feature.

Thanks for your time.

I was curious as to what the changes were in fvwm2 over fvwm1.x so I am trying to install fvwm2.0.40 on my system.  I am
currently running Linux1.2.13 with XFree86 3.1.1 and using gcc 2.6.3.  Everything compiles fine except for the main fvwm2
module where I am getting the following message in the link stage:

gcc -o fvwm2 -O2 -m486 -ansi     -L/usr/X11R6/lib add_window.o  bindings.o      borders.o       builtins.o      colormaps.o

I did an nm on libX11.a and found that it does indeed have a symbol for XLoadQueryFont in its index.  I left configure.h to be
the default values except I set MODALITY_IS_EVIL.  I just wanted to know if anyone else had a similar problem.  Thanks.

This is a common problem. There is an error in the Makefile in ./fvwm -
the order of the libraries is wrong, libfvwm should be first:

gcc -o fvwm2 -O2 -m486 -ansi -L/usr/X11R6/lib   ...object files...\
 ../libs/libfvwm2.a -lXpm -lXExExt -lXext -lX11

Simple for you perhaps, but I have no clue what the bindist command
is.  I'm assuming that it's an Irix specific command, as I can't find
it under AIX.

Well, you should be able to do that, as I believe others have.
Unfortunately, not having access to an SGI machine, I don't have any
clue about what specific oddities you have to do to replace 4Dwm.

Can anyone else on the list help Roger?  If there is something special
that needs to be done for this I'll add it to the FAQ.

Do you mean `bsdinst'? This is part of the X distribution that provides
an `install' command that is equivalent to the BSD one for systems that
don't have it. As well as copying, it can change permissions and
ownership of the installed file. Usually you can just let the X setup
sort it out, it gets used if your system needs it.

Maybe Roger is referring to the 'bsdinst' command on the SGI?

If it helps, SGI's Irix (I'm speaking of Irix 5.x) comes with two
installation commands:

1) /sbin/install, which is a System-V-style-install, e.g.

	install -f destdir -m 755 -u user -g group filename

2) /usr/bin/X11/bsdinst, which is a (surprise) BSD-compatible install:

	install -cs -m 755 -u root -g bin filename destdir

   SGI states that bsdinst is actually a wrapper to their System V
   install.

You may want to just grab a copy of 'install.sh' from the current X11R6
source distribution (it's in xc/config/util/install.sh), although being
a shell script, it's pretty slow compared to the C code versions.
Probably there are several BSD/Linux/GNU versions written in C available
on the Net.

I normally have an IconBox region to hold my icons.  This works just
fine.  However, the icons move around within the region.  For example,
iconify two apps, A and B.  Deiconify the top left most icon, let's
say it's A.  Switch to another virtual screen.  The B icon is now at
the top left of the region.  When I switch back to the original
screen, and iconify A, the icon order is now B A.

I know that by moving the icon, I can fix it's location.  This works
fine, but is it possible for this to happen automatically?  If not in
general, how about just for sticky windows that are iconified?  I'd
like that space reserved for those icons too.  That way, if both A and
B are deiconified, and I iconify C, C doesn't go into the space where
A's icon used to be.  When I iconify A, it goes over C's icon.

Alternatively, I can use FvwmIconBox.  This is ok, but it puts every
icon in the box.  Is it possible to only show the icons in the current
virtual screen?  How about making it only show the iconified apps, and
show no icons for the deiconified apps?  Or at least do what mwm does
and hashes out the icons for the apps that are open.

One of these features would be nice to have, but I can't do it myself,
unfortunately.

In any case, fvwm is still the best wm around!

I've been using 2.0.40 under IRIX 5.3.  There are no oddities to
getting it to work.  Here's a copy of my "what-I-did" file, for IRIX
and Solaris, using ksh.  This keeps sources in a /c/src directory, and
installs fvwm into a /usr/fvwm directory, so make the appropriate
changes.

[Please cc, I don't subscribe to this list]

First, this is not a bug in fvwm: no client should be able to crash an
Xserver.  I send this to you because I suspect it is highly unlikely
that SGI will acknowledge and fix this problem in a timely manner
(IRIX 6 will be out for everything at some point and they'll just say
'upgrade'), and I hope someone can provide a workaround.  I don't mean
to pick on SGI, I just need a quick fix.

OS: SGI IRIX 5.x (only) on all graphics hardware I could test (VGX,
    XL, XT, RE^2).  It does not affect 4.x or 6.x on any hardware I
    could detect.

Software: Xsgi (X11R5 unknown patchlevel provided by SGI), and
    fvwm-1.2x (built with gcc, IRIX cc, linked against SGI Xlibs, MIT
    Xlibs at R5pl26 and R6pl13) or fvwm-2.0.40 (any build and link
    combination as above), and ImageMagick-3.x (as above).  [NOTE: I
    have not gone through every single combination of the 3 since at
    some point the number of combinations approaches ridiculousness,
    >1M I'm sure if I recall anything from my statistics class]  Oh,
    and xpm-3.4f as well if that matters.

Descripton: It's the combination of software that causes Xsgi to
crash.  The same ImageMagick binary running under SGI's 4Dwm does not
cause the crash (in fact, the ImageMagick author tells me that she
develops on an SGI not unlike the one on my desk and doesn't see the
problem).  Displaying images with ImageMagick works fine (in general),
but as soon as any image manipulation is done (say to double the
viewing size) the server dumps core and xdm restarts.

At one point someone here was working on a solution to the problem and
mentioned tracking it down to a backing store request being made by
ImageMagick.  I've fiddled a little with the code of ImageMagick to
get it to set backing store requests to 'Never' but it has not helped
the problem, so that seems like a dead end.  I'm not at a loss.

Any intrepid soul out there willing to offer some assistance?  I'm
currently running R5 Xsgi (from vendor), and fvwm-1.24r linked against
R6pl13 with gcc.  I can change to fvwm-2.0.40 and use R5 libs (or
vendor libs) if needed to find a cure.

I am afraid I must be missing something here.  I am trying to compile 
fvwm2 so that it will read a users .fvwm2rc if it exists, and if not read 
the system default.  (in this case, /afs/eos/contrib/wm/lib/system.fvwm2rc)
I have tried many different settings for FVWMRC in configure.h and have 
yet to stumble upon the correct way to go about this.  I honestly can't 
believe that this feature wouldn't be in there somewhere.  I'm afraid I 
am at the end of my rope here.  Looking over the man page, I noticed that 
=perhaps= the way to go about it is with the read command, yet..  for 
this to be effective, I would need to be able to detect if the .fvwm2rc 
existed and if it did, read it and exit, otherwise continue on.  (in the 
system.fvwm2rc)  I can not see a way to go about this.  Maybe I'm just 
tired and looking right over it, but I've been sitting here all day 
looking at it and I'm just getting very frustrated.  I would greatly 
appreciate it if someone would tell me what I need to do.  I could go in 
and hack the source code, but I really would rather not.

Thanks for your time,
Daniel

This is the standard behavior for fvwm2.  It is how it works on my
installation.  Are you sure that it does not work that way on yours?  Do
you have the default .fvwm2rc file in the right place?  It should be in
the same directory as the modules.

I'm running fvwm 2.039, and there's a problem with FVWMButtons that's been
there since 1.24.  Whenever I want to specify a "text-only" button bar,
FVWMButtons doesn't resize the buttons automatically to fit the longest
string of text.  Instead, I have to force a geometry size on it, which is a
pain because I change it often.

Has anyone come across a hack for this problem?  In addition, I would like to
know if FvwmButtons, or any toolbar out there, that can have a pixmap + text
next to it, as opposed to below it, sorta like Windows 95 (gasp!) or OS/2's
"flowed" view.  I really like that style.

Hi all,
I have bothered to configure FvwmAudio to play some neat sounds but it 
wont work for all configured events. Behaviour is the same for both
fvwm 2.0.40
and the vanilla fvwm 1.23b that came with Slackware 3.0
Is this normal or am I missing something somewhere?
TIA
Frank
Working events are:                     currently NOT working seem to be:

About these two I am not sure: I don't toggle

I've had some reports about FvwmAudio having problems, but until I
order a bigger hard drive for my Linux box so I can recompile the
kernel for sound support, I can't test any of these.  I plan to order
one real soon now (hopefully), so perhaps in a few weeks I can get to
testing this.

In the meantime, if anyone else out there can test FvwmAudio and
perhaps even submit some patches, that'd be real cool.

For what it's worth...

The backing store setting in the client is only a recommendation to the
server, it may still decide to use backing store in all cases. The MIT
sample X server has a -bs flag to turn off backing store completely, you
might try that instead if Xsgi has it.

I tripped on the -bs option late yesterday afternoon, and it did
indeed fix the problem.  It didn't occur to me that client backing
store requests were a recommendation and not a demand of the server.
Thanks.

The backing store setting in the client is only a recommendation to the
server, it may still decide to use backing store in all cases. The MIT

*FvwmAudio icon_name weeek.au
#annoying :) *FvwmAudio raise_window spring.au
#annoying :) *FvwmAudio lower_window sticky.au
#annoying :) *FvwmAudio focus_change metal.au


I'm not having any problems with add_window, iconify, or deiconify.
Are you sure the sounds drip.au, clink.au, and hypspc.au are
accessible to the sound player you're using?  You might need to set
FvwmAudioDir or specify the complete pathname.

FvwmAudio has an internal table that maps the module event names like
"add_window" to the real module events defined in module.h.  I just
checked the mapping and it looks correct:

new_page		M_NEW_PAGE
new_desk		M_NEW_DESK
add_window		M_ADD_WINDOW
raise_window		M_RAISE_WINDOW
lower_window		M_LOWER_WINDOW
configure_window	M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW
focus_change		M_FOCUS_CHANGE
destroy_window		M_DESTROY_WINDOW
iconify			M_ICONIFY
deiconify		M_DEICONIFY
window_name		M_WINDOW_NAME
icon_name		M_ICON_NAME
res_class		M_RES_CLASS
res_name		M_RES_NAME
end_windowlist		M_END_WINDOWLIST
icon_location		M_ICON_LOCATION
map			M_MAP
error			M_ERROR
config_info		M_CONFIG_INFO
end_config_info		M_END_CONFIG_INFO
icon_file		M_ICON_FILE
default_icon		M_DEFAULTICON

(Note to Chuck, when new module events are added to module.h, please
add the corresponding event to the table in FvwmAudio.c)

Hi there!!!

 Is there any place where one can obtain more xpm files. I have a few but as
 I am updating my FVWM window manager, I would like to get new ones. 
 
 Anyone may want to share a couple?

Have you configured the build as fvwm or fvwm2? Check that it's not
looking for .fvwmrc.

	Hi,
	I've not really "tested" FvwmAudio but after having compiled Linux with 
the sounds drivers and found a package to play .Wav files, I started it, and it 
worked fine with the events I configured (start and finish session, open and 
close window). Now I've turned it off because my box is not powerfull enough to 
support this kind of software without decreasing perfs, but it works...
	Thanks to all of you, creators of Fvwm. At first, I took it for a 
replacment for Motif wich can't be installed on my Linux box, but now, I would 
*choose* it. Thanks.
	Fab.

I just switched to fvwm 2.0.38 and I've been trying to get the 
FvwmIconBox to work. Everytime I start it up I all I get is the icon box 
but no icons in it. Is there something I'm doing wrong??
this is my module definition for the iconbox.

You need to set, in the main part of your .fvwm2rc, all apps to have
no icon. ie:

Style "*" NoIcon

FvwmIconBox will only have icons for apps that have no desktop icon.

Check out http://www.sct.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/.  If you don't find what
you need there, chances are:

1. it doesn't exist.
2. you don't need it.

Mark> Have you configured the build as fvwm or fvwm2? Check that it's not
Mark> looking for .fvwmrc.

In configure.h, you should have:

#define FVWM fvwm2
#define FVWMRC ".fvwm2rc"
#define FVWMDIR "/afs/eos/contrib/wm/lib"

Also, it's not looking for the 'system' at the front of the filename.
Make sure your installed default is just named .fvwm2rc in your FVWMDIR
directory, and all should work as expected.

The Read command should be working as follows: it looks for the file
as specified (current working dir & partial path if specified or full
path if specified), if not found then off the HOME directory (same
name & partial path if specifed), if still not found then out of the
FVWMDIR directory (same name & partial path if specifed).

I configured it to build it as fvwm2.  After numerous suggestions, we 
found that I was assuming it looked for a system.fvwm2rc like I had set 
up before.  I had forgotten that when I changed the FVWMRC variable to 
.fvwm2rc that I needed to change system.fvwm2rc to .fvwm2rc.  I do not 
remember the name of the person who pointed this out to me, but you know 
who you are.  Thanks.

Hi,

I compiled 2.0.40 last night. Slick. 

One small thing I noticed is that when I move my mouse out of
a rxvt window, the focus is left there unless I move in another
window. I would have taken this as a feature if I hadnt found
that same thing did not happen to xterm windows.

Another question. Do I need X11R6, or R5 will do?

I am not on the list so please copy me on reply.

RTFM.  Feature: SloppyFocus.  Acts as MouseFocus, except it basically
ignores the Root window.

R5 is fine.

I also gathered a bunch of .xpm files from the AIcons repository.
(ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/AIcons)

I made an interesting enhancement to some of the icons.
Using the pixmap(1x) program
(ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xapps/graphics/draw/pixmap-2.6.tar.gz),
I removed the background color, so now the "background" is transparent.
This gives icons a cool standout look against the X root screen.

Now my xterm icon is simply Homer's head, not a 32x32 picture.

These icons look great in an FvwmButton bar too, since the bar provides
a common background color to all the icons.


You're welcome to check out the few icons I've converted this way:
including 32x32 pixmaps of Homer, Mr. Burns, Milhouse, Bart,
Maggie, Calvin, Hobbes, Dilbert, Betty Boop.

This is a portion of my .fvwm2rc
it calls xrsh which opens an xterm on a remote workstation with the 
display on my computer. for some reason it works from my prompt and it 
also works if i send it to FvwmTalk, but if i click on it in the menu, 
nothing happens.

just regard the "scws35" part as one continuous line.
am i doing something idiotic?

AddToMenu Xterms ""

I'm about to release a new version of FvwmIconMan, and it now has the ability
to follow which window has the focus. (For those who don't know, which I
assume is most of you, FvwmIconMan is an icon manager similar to TWM's icon
manager. You can find it on hpc.uh.edu). It would be nice if the fvwm Focus
function wouldn't have to always raise and warp the cursor to the target
window. Probably the best way to do this is to have the Focus function take a
few paramters. 

Is this on anybody's todo list, or should I do it myself?

Hello.  I've just installed fvwm 2 level 40 on my ibm rs6k 320,
under AIX 3.2.5.1.  While it's fresh in my mind I thought I'd 
provide some feedback on the install process.

I have two years part-time experience administering a single
rs6k 360, and I am not an idiot, but in general I found the 
install somewhat confusing and difficult.

My usual habit on installs is to download the tar file to my
own home directory and build it there, then su root and install
it in /usr/local.  (I try to keep mods to the rest of /usr to
an absolute minimum, in case I ever have to reinstall the system
from the University install server.)

Of course I didn't have imake, had never heard of it, so I had
to go find that first.  The INSTALL instructions directed me
to ftp.X.org but there is a lot there.  I concluded (perhaps
mistakenly) that imake was no longer available unbundled from
the rest of X11R5, and went looking elsewhere.  I found imake
stand-alone at ftp.primate.wisc.edu.  I gave the quick-start
instructions a shot and it appeared to build correctly.  That
was the first two hours.  On to fvwm.

Bug:

The configure.h file could use a few more instructions.  
In particular:

/* Where do you want the fvwm binaries installed. */
/* #define FVWM_BINDIR /usr/bin/X11 */

I changed FVWM_BINDIR to /usr/local/bin/X11, and the make
process eventually quit with:  mkdirhier not found.
It appears that things are set up to also use FVWM_BINDIR as
the path for mkdirhier, in addition to "where to install
the binaries".  During the imake build my mkdirhier was
placed in /usr/local/bin.  This is the only thing I would
call a genuine bug in the install process.

Suggest clarification:

Upon completion of the install, I found that while fvwm
itself had been installed in /usr/local/bin as I'd intended,
the sanctity of my /usr/lib/X11 had been violated by a 
new directory fvwm, with  FvwmAudio, FvwmCpp, FvwmIdent, etc.
Upon reexamining the configure.h file, I noted:

 ** FVWMDIR is the install dir for all execs

For info:
imake (and xmkmf that goes with it) is very much an integral part of
X11 (R5 and R6). It is the tool used to configure a build of the X
sources from the X Consortium. The intention is that an installation of
X will have imake, xmkmf and appropriate configuration files that supply
all the system-dependant things like special includes, defines and
libraries.

Well, since you are working on a new version, it is an occasion for me
to tell you that I could never get it to work. It compiles fine
(SunOS4.1.3+X11R6+gcc2.7.0), but when I launch it, no window
appears. If I switch to a different pager pane, a window shows up, but
it contains nothing in it.

Well, what do I do now?

(Apologies if this is a stupid question.)

I'm trying to compile FVWM2 (fvwm-2.0.40) on a Sun workstation (Solaris 2.4),
and am having a problem with it.

In configure.h I put:
/* What compiler over-ride's do you want. */
#define FVWM_COMPILER gcc -g -Wall 

to account for Sun's odd compiler.

However I'm getting this error:

making all in ./fvwm...
gcc -g -Wall -O -xF -DSYSV -DSVR4 -xF -Wa,-cg92  -I.  -I/home7/dcjk/lib -I/usr/openwin/include  -DSVR4 -DSYSV     -c  builtins.c
gcc: language F not recognized
builtins.c:999: parse error before `/'
builtins.c: In function `Circulate':

make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `builtins.o'
Current working directory /scratch7/dcjk/fvwm2/fvwm/fvwm
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'


Anyone know what this means? I don't see anything wrong but then I never can with someone elses code!
According to the README's and stuff it should compile fine on a Solaris 2.4 machine.

The /home7/dcjk/lib/ mention above is where my Xpm stuff ended up by the way. Any help appreciated.

When you do a xmkmf, the definitions taken for your compiler are for Sun's
compiler (-xF -Wa,-cg92).  the -x option does not have the same definition in
gcc.  Either modify your installa tion or modify the Imakefile/Makefile to
override thes option flags.

Well, upon suggestions I removed the Sun switches (-xF -Wa, -cg92) section from the 
compilation but I still get the error.

I have to confess that I usually have no idea what most of the compiler switches
are for so any help would still be apreciated.

It still flags up the same error, is this version new by any chance? Is there
a typo in there or is gcc being very awkward? :-)

This looks like all the extra flags that "Sun's odd compiler"
needs. They will have been provided by the imake configuration in
Solaris 2.4.

If you always want to use gcc, you can add the following line to
/usr/openwin/lib/config/site.def in the #ifdef BeforeVendorCF section:
        #define HasGcc2 YES

Alternatively, take a copy of the xmkmf script from /usr/openwin/bin and
add this to the imake command:
        -DHasGcc2

Hopefully, this will cause the gcc template to be used for your
Makefiles.

Also check that your definition of FVWM_MODULEDIR has quotes around it.

I don't see anything wrong with the source, so I must be missing something...

That's usually not an error.   At least it is  a warning for me.  Look
further in the output.

I do exactly the same thing, and it usually works for me.  Some things
to try:

1. put a "&" at the end of the above line
2. the man page says -pass takes a quote-delimited string, so quite it
3. Try a simple "rsh" to the remote host first, to make sure that part
   of the connection works.
4. "xterm" may not be enough.  I've found that I have to specify the
   full path, like /usr/bin/X11/xterm.  Of course, that path had to be
   correct on the remote host, not the local host.

The install process is not 100% clean, as you found out.  I have some
more patches to the Imake related files for the next release that may
help.

The build/install process is one of the few things that's really
keeping me from releasing the first official 2.xx release (it's still
beta, in case you didn't know).

Just so everyone knows his reason for saying this, for some unknown
reason Imake is not installed by default on IBM machines, which is
most unfortunate.

If you can manage to install the Xamples tree (under
/usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/) from your install medium (it should be in there
somewhere, as I found it), the imake related files will be there and
can relatively easily be compiled I believe.  If I remember correctly
(it was a while ago), that's what I did.

Just a warning about unrecognized -xF option with gcc.  Not fatal.

In configure.h, put double quotes around the directory name you are 
specifying for FVWM_MODULEDIR.  For example,

#define FVWM_MODULEDIR "/usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm"

Although this line is commented out in the default configure.h file, I would
suggest that quotes be added to this line in the fvwm distribution.  
Also, after I quoted this, it seems like I had problems with the 
'install' program on one of my computers---but, I can't remember for 
sure!!

More warnings; not fatal.


Hope this helps.

I am just wondering if someone who has gotten fvwm to compile on SunOS 
4.1.3 running XR6 could get in contact with me so I could get a chance to 
get this sucker compiled.

Thanks for any help!

Users of Ultrix-4.{2,3} (not positive whether they fixed it in 4.4, as we
never installed that), will also doubtless be frustrated by the badness
of imake in that Unice.  Strange, since DEC was in on X from the start,
I think.  I had to build my own R5, and later R6, to ever get any X app
running on my DECStation (w/o hacking the crap out of the default
Makefile, at least).

Maybe they fixed it in 4.4, and they replaced Ultrix with OSF, I think,
so not too many people care, but anyway...

Thankyou for using the correct (singular) case of this word.  It was
oddly pleasant to read.

Anyway delay zero is no prb, as people probably limit themselves to a few

is there any way to hack the code so that when you are in sloppyfocus mode

has anyone done this?

     *FvwmAudioDelay 5
          Specifies that sound events will only be played if they

          Sounds events that occur during the  delay  period  are

[Thanks to anyone who offered advice on compiling Fvwm2, it was FVWM_MODULEDIR]

Having finally managed to get FVWM compiled I have a few (minor) problems adapting to it
from 'olvwm'.

I tried to set up key bindings to emulate diamond-w and diamond-q, which iconise
and close windows.

I added this to my .fvwmrc:

Key W      FST   M     Iconify +1

(the help says to use the keyname from /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, it doesn't
exist on our system, I used both the number and the name 'W' which appeared under
xmodmap -pke)

This doesn't work. How should it read?

I'm also having problems getting icons to settle in one place.
Style "*" 	IconBox +0 -20 +500 -0
This should be the bottom left corner yes? This is the only reference to IconBox left yet
icons just appear everywhere.

And lastly, and most importantly, does anyone have any idea why I can't use my arrow keys
in aplications like 'Knews' anymore? (I sorted out the SunDoom problem of not being able
to fire [Ctrl] and move [Arrow] keys at the same time. Some bindings are just no worth
it! ;-) )

I use diamond-q with the following two .fvwmrc key bindings.  The line 
with the 'M3' modifier is to catch the case when the NumLock key has 
been pressed (i.e. mod3).  To be noted are the lower case q's used in the 
definition; upper case won't work.
 
Key q       FTIWS       M      Close 
Key q       FTIWS       M3     Close

Yes, this should be lower left corner.  It does the same thing on my 
systems, but changing the '-0' to '-1' mysteriously makes it work!! Could 
be a bug?

Hmmm, all arrow keys work fine in all my applications.  Check out the 
ICCCM COMPLIANCE section of the fvwm man page and the 'Lenience' style.  
I don't know anything about this one, but it may be related.  Or, are the 
arrow keys simply re-mapped to do something else??

Hope this helps.

Well, the only mappings on the arrows keys read like this:

Key Left 	R	M	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	R	M	Scroll 100 0
Key Up		R 	M	Scroll 0 -100
Key Down	R	M	Scroll 0 100

This can't affect the normal usage of the keys surely? 
I read the section about 'Lenience' and to be honest I wasn't too sure what it meant by
"so fvwm provides a window-style, 'Lenience', which will allow fvwm to overlook this
ICCCM rule."

This implies an entry like:
Style "Knews"	StickyIcon, Lenience
which has no effect. (Oddly enough! Its not mentioned in the style section or anywhere else
after that 'window-style' section.)

Any ideas? Perhaps its just Knews...I can't think what else I use keys for a lot at the moment.

RTFM . . . fvwm2 comes with a script called fvwmrc_convert. . . it
should be installed in the same directories as your fvwm2 binaries. . .
or look in the distribution for it.

If you sysadmin installed it, look for the directory where your modules
are installed.  It could be there.

I believe the dotrc conversion script makes some assumptions that can be 
quite confusing, regarding the location of awk, and stated above for 
FVWM_MODULEDIR. Maybe the script should ask for FVWM_MODULEDIR, or it 
could be fixed at compilation time.

I think your IconBox is too small (ie not high enough), and IconPlacement 
has a default when an icon can not be placed in the Box (generally 
because the Box is full) You might try -100 instead of -20.
I guess that fvwm tries to put icons topmost-leftmost into the iconbox, so
tuning the height of the box might be a bit trying when you put the box 
on the lower edge of your screen
Hope this helps

This, I promise, will be my last question for quite a while now that I have the
icons under control.

Does anyone out there still use Sun's Mailtool with Fvwm (preferably Fvwm2)?
If so could they drop me an email regarding fixing its behaviour where double clicking on
a new message drops an icon instead of an open view message pane?

Just a note on handy compiling, despite giving the location of my (non-system wide)
Xpm libraries in configure.h for a few of the modules I had to go and modify the 
Makefiles and slot the location of it into a duplicate slot, USRLIBDIR or similiar 
which was just repeating the openwin stuff. (Did anyone else understand me there?)
Other than that and finally resolving the unexpected FVWM_MODULEDIR problem the compilation
was quite pain free. A couple more comments in the version two fvwmrc (fvwmrc2) file
would have helped I feel, or perhaps a couple more files period (as there was in the
first distribution of fvwm).

I've just deleted the compilation dir (my usual backup to tape takes to long if I keep
all my rubbish!) so can't check this on the TO-DO list, but there are a few features of
other managers that would be very useful. I'm most familiar with olvwm (I worked under
Olwm when I started my PhD) and it has one feature I miss, you were able to take a full
window, drag it into the Pager and drop it in another window, satying where you were.
I'd imagine that is on the To-Do list, if not, it really is a valuable shortcut.
A system of being able to say which 'page' of a 'desk' an application starts on would also be
useful, I like sliding between pages yet can't specify applications to go on Desk 1, page 2,
say 4 programs start on desk 1 at once, it gets crowded.

Thanks again for everyones help while compiling, much appreciated.

There's no mention whatsoever in the man pages about changing the cursor
font in different areas (menus, title bars... etc..) but in the
configuration options homepage by Liem Someone, they mention a directive
that looks like this:

Cursor <cursor_area> <cursor_font>

Where cursor_area is an enumeration of all the possible areas fvwm can
alter the cursor and cursor_font is the cursor_font number.  However, I
get a "Cursor: No such function" if I try it with fvwm2.  

Help is definitely appreciated.

This will be because imake didn't finish making the Makefile.

I still have Mailtool on my system and it does not exhibit this 
behaviour.  Just a curious question, do you have a line like this in your 
.fvwmrc?

  Style "Mailtool"    StartIconic

If so, this would not only start the initial application iconic, but it would
also open any new windows spawned from the application in the iconic state. 
This is because they all share the "mailtool" resource and class name.  

If not, look for any Style definitions with the StartIconic option and 
make sure they are not getting matched up with Mailtool somehow.

Also, mailtool does start iconic on my system by default, even without
specifying it as a Style.

Someone recently pointed out a bug to me, and I wanted to make sure
that it gets fixed.

Fvwm compares the return value from XGetWMName and XGetWMIconName to 
the define "Success",ie if(XGetWMName(...) != Success)return;

We should compare to zero, according to the man page.

The above comparison occurs several times, just getp XGetWM in the
source to find it.

There is no mention of StartIconic or anything that could be confused
with mailtool.
Mailtool just likes being an icon but under fvwm2 so do the panes which
should popup open showing you the message you last clicked on.

If I leave a message in my mailbox and leave the view message pane up,
tell Mailtool I'm 'Done' it'll iconise itself and behave properly next time,
but then I always think I have new mail.
A message appearing first in a new message pane just appears as an icon, which
is a little distracting when you are expecting it to appear. Especially when
it goes and hides behind the button bar or something!

I was just hoping there was some way of forcing it to open up properly.
Ah well. I'll just live with it or go use another mailer.

This came up before. It seems that some versions (newer ones?) of mailtool
don't have this problem. As I recall, we thought that it was a mailtool
bug, not an fvwm bug, but do an xprop and look at the Initial State property
to be sure.

I've been cleaning these up as I run across them, but I'll make an

Within the pager, you can grab the image of a window and move it to other

I too would very much like to see this.  Perhaps the syntax could be
something like "StartsOnDesk 0:1" for page 1 of desk 0?  Then the
X geometry could be interpreted as being relative to that page rather
than the current page...

i am tryin' to switch to fvwm2.
2 problems right now:

i used fvwm_convert to get my fvwm2rc file.

1.  fvwm2 doesn't 'melt' when i want to change windows.  i have to click on the
window i want to use to get it to come to the top.

2.  when i call up a new application now, i have to 'sit' it down on the
desktop myself.  the apps used to place themselves on the desktop.  what
happened to SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement & all of that good stuff.  i have
warning messages in my .fvwm2rc file that say these commands saying that those
keywords aren't supported.  fvwm2 has to have something good about it, but i
don't see it yet.  any help would be appreciated!!

thankx.

This would certainly be alot nicer than what I do now, which is
calculate the screenwidth and height with xdpyinfo and specify
geometry with appropriate multiples of those values.  However for
those who want to do it, an example would be

xterm -geometry +0+`expr $SCREENHEIGHT`

which puts the xterm on the page one below where I'm currently at
(because geometry is always relative to the current page).  I don't
use it enough to generalize it into a shell script, though that would
be pretty easy, but I do use it in my .X11Startup file for those
things I always start.  Of course it does mean I can't move out of the
first page until everything has mapped when I log in.

That's what I was doing too, only it was so ugly I was embarrassed to
admit it.  :-)  I delved into the source with the intention of coming up
with some fix for this, only to discover that there is a way to do
something that's close enough for my purposes - use the "GotoPage"
function.  Here's an example of how to use it:

AddToFunc StartTin      "I"     Desk 0 0
+       "I"     GotoPage 0 1
+       "I"     Exec xterm -geometry 98x64+0+0 -ls -e /usr/local/bin/tin &


This should move to desk 0, then to the second page down on the left,
then start up an xterm running tin.  Seems to work from any initial
desk.

It would be sort of nice to have the client start on the new desk and
page without switching to that page, but I think that would require mods
to the source code to do.

Hello Everyone,

Has anyone tried using motif applications under fvwm2?  I would like to
run Wingz 2.11 under SunOS/X11R6 on fvwm2.  Has anyone tried this or
other motif applications on a similar platform?

the conversion script sets the modulepath to some strange location. Set it
right and fvwm2 will find your modules. Look for the keyword FVWM_MODULEDIR
in your dotrc.

Don't be embarrased.  That's the way I do it too.

The problem with that being that it can only be used in the .fvwm2rc,
which I know many people would rather start their apps in the .xinitrc
(I'm in that group as well).  I'm sure that they would like to be able
to do this too.

Yup, it will require mods to the source.  But, I kinda like this idea,
so I've added it to the TO-DO list:

  - Add StartsOnPage x y or something similiar to compliment
    StartsOnDesk (and add X resource FvwmPage which will be analogous
    to the Desk X resource, which I think should be renamed to
    FvwmDesk)

That is where the SkipMapping feature works, which I learned about from 
this very list!  Here is what I use (two examples):

Style "xv"         StartsOnDesk 4, SkipMapping
Style "Mosaic"     StartsOnDesk 4, SkipMapping

A desire was also expressed to know about features specific to fvwm2, to 
motivate further effort in the conversion to fvwm2.  I have been very 
happy about the per-window style features which have been added in fvwm2, 
and I have used the additional modules, at least on occasion.  I just 
recently wiped all of my saved fvwm mailing-list messages, as I found I 
referred to them essentially never.  The message from Rob Nation about 
the SkipMapping feature was prompted by another user poking about in the 
source and asking whether a feature provided for by this declaration had 
been implemented.  Nation (forgive me if I am garbling the recollection) 
essentially confessed that the feature was indeed functional, but that in
the passage of the info through several software layers, the name was 
changed in subtle ways so as to hide the path to the uninitiated (not 
deliberately, but in fact).  He also mentioned that he currently used 
this feature.  I, too, now use it and am very grateful for it.  I have 
not discovered why some of my applications override the 
SmartPlacement/RandomPlacement declaration (certain Motif applications 
just pop up on my screen even when they cover other windows; I suspect 
this has to do with the PPosition stuff I saw on the list but can't find 
in the manpage) and others don't.  xv, for instance, will start on the 
specified Desk, but if the window doesn't have a large enough hole on the 
page I'm currently displaying, fvwm will make me pick a placement for it 
on the present page.  The window then disappears, as if the app had 
crashed, but it is indeed properly set up on the specified Desk.  This 
seems to be a bug in the SkipMapping and *Placement interaction.

Michael Tiefenback, 

happy to be able to provide some constructive info back to the list users....

Motif programs should have no troubles running under fvwm.  I use lots
of them.

In fact (RTFM) fvwm even recognizes Motif MWM hints, so it handles
Motif programs better than a lot of other non-MWM window managers.

i am assuming that

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 250

is equivalent to the AutoRaise function in fvwm1.2.  but my windows don't
automatically come to the top when i enter them. i have to click on the borders
to get them to come to the top.  what am i doing wrong?

thanks.

It took a moment to figure out what you meant by 'melt', but RTFM -
FvwmAuto module.

Again, RTFM.  The FAQ included with the distribution (latest is
2.0.40) has fvwm 1.xx to 2.xx conversion chart.  These particular ones
are controlled via the 'Style' command:

Style "*"           RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement

Fvwm2 does have a lot of good things about it, with many more coming
in the future.  But the changes between the versions may make
conversion difficult.

Plus, since it's still beta code the docs and examples are not
completely up to date (so RTFM might not even help sometimes), and the
conversion script doesn't work 100%, which I meant to put a warning
about in the docs at some point.  I'll make sure that this warning is
in the docs and printed by the conversion script as well for the next
release.

I'm trying to clean up the docs and build process so I can officially
release it so I can start doing some of the bigger projects on the
TO-DO list.

Just saw some related notes come in:

John> i am assuming that

John> AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 250

Yup, it should be.

The quotes around InitFunction aren't needed, but I don't know if this
is being a problem or not.  But this might be:

You might want to start with a whole new .fvwm2rc file and add your
old customizations in the new format by hand.

If you want to see if it's finding FvwmAuto, try running FvwmTalk and
typing "Module FvwmAuto 250" in it and see if it gives an error
message.  If it doesn't, then the module is being invoked and there is
another problem.

I use the same thing in this manner:

AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmButtons
                           Module FvwmAuto 50

Note that there's no "I" before Module for FvwmAuto...

Hope that helps...

does fvwm2 have a function (command) equivalent to the CirculateSkipIcons

well this is not a part of InitFunction then:
it's simply a command standing in .fvwm2rc on its own. 
So it's executed as .fvwm2rc is read.

it'd have to be a
	+ "I"    Module FvwmAuto 50
in order to be added to the InitFunction definition, and be executed as
soon as InitFunction was called.

I am using fvwm 2.0.40 under Solaris 2.4 on a SparcStation 10. I noticed that
the individual desktop size appears to be slightly bigger than the physical
screen. I looked through the man page and the .fvwm2rc but nothing jumped out
at me. 

This is probably a no-brainer but any suggestions would be appreciated.

I've tried to create a helpful page with fvwm2 snapshots and the .fvwmrc which 
created them at:

http://mars.superlink.net/user/ekahler/html/fvwm.html

At the end of the page are pointers to other fvwm web pages.

Luck++;

Hi,

I just downloaded and built fvwm yesterday (it's great!) and am having
trouble making buttons look 3-D.  Specifically I need a button for "Close"
and "Resize".  I found an "X" button but (ok, I'm picky) it's a little too
bold. 

Thanks,

I recently upgraded from pl3x to pl40.  Everything appears to work
fine except for the following minor display bug.  I saw this bug
before in 1.2x or an early 2.0, but it was fixed.  Now it's back.

Open any Openwindows app.  Move the mouse pointer slowly from top to
bottom across the title bar of the app.  As the pointer crosses the
boundary between the top frame and the title bar, the whole frame
flickers very briefly from the active to inactive back to the active
color.  In fact moving the mouse across any part of the inner part
frame border causes this very brief flashing. 

Unless you're paying attention, you probably won't notice it because
it happens very quickly.

Here's what I use for resize. It's a shadowed approximation of the twm
nested squares resize icon. NB: it's from fvwm 1.x. I don't know (yet)
if button styles changed in version 2.

ButtonStyle : 2 14 0x0@1 0x20@1 20x20@0 20x0@0 0x0@1 0x25@1 25x25@1

well i (fvwm 2.0.40) encounter the same thing under sunos 5.4 
on a sparc 1000 (4 cpu's, 256mb). but this only happens if
i entered the window from the root window or from another 
openwindows application that was entered from the root window.

when i come from any other non openwin app 
or from an openwin app that was entered from a non openwin app 
the behavior is normal (no flashing).

as this might be a bit confusing, here's an overview:

root --> owin          : flashing
root --> owin --> owin : flashing
root --> xapp --> owin : no flashing
owin --> xapp --> owin : no flashing

Here's a few web sites dedicated to FVWM.  Some of them contain
pictures.

Now this confuses me a little...  FVWM doesn't run under DOS/Windoze.
It runs under Unix platforms like Linux, AIX, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX,
etc.  So I have a feeling that the above info may be useless to you,
unless you want to install Linux on your PC.

Just remove the ':' and the syntax is correct for fvwm2.  Here are a
few that I've collected from people who've posted them or created

I am trying to compile fvwm that picked off sunsite and am having trouble 
getting it going. The failure occurs when I try to build the fvwm file 
itself. The failure message is:

../libs/libfvwm.a(GetFont.o)(.text+0x8f): undefined reference to  \
`XLoadQueryFont '

I am using Linux-aout, 1.2.13, gcc version 2.7.2 (had the same problem 
with 2.6.3), and Xfree 3.1.2. Any help is appreciated.

Al Lovrich,

I had the same problem, as have many others. Time ago a kind person
from .uk (whose name I have forgotten) posted a patch,  which worked
for me. Put the lines below in a file (eg 'make.patch') and use the command 
patch < make.patch makefile.h, where makefile.h is the one being distributed
in the top directory of fvwm just after it untar'ed. It looks like the 
problem is a wrong link command, which has the libraries in the wrong 
order. I wish someone would upload a new copy with this fix included, since
at least all Linux users will have this problem. 

I will now spend the weekend on making .fvwm2rc .. but might some of you 
have such files already, that I or others could build on? Anyway, I shall 
post mine somewhere, if I ever finish it. 

Niels Larsen, niels@truth.mph.msu.edu

FvwmAudio supports rplay which does run on Linux.  You can also set
the FvwmAudio sound play command to execute a simple shell script
like this:

#!/bin/sh
cat $1 > /dev/audio

[script deleted]

My personal favorite is auplay that is part of NAS, Network Audio
System.  The whole package might be a bit too big for you, but, it has
one major advantage over rplay: if two sounds are played at almost the
same time, the sounds are added together so that you hear both.  With
rplay, I think the second sound is blocked until the first one is done
playing.  This is rather annoying if you use sounds a lot.

NAS runs on builds on linux without problems.

Indeed, NAS is another good option.  I really shouldn't get into this
on the fvwm list, but Raymond's message isn't correct.  By default
rplay can play 12 sounds simultaneously and it has always been this
way.

While we're talking about NAS, would anyone like to add built-in
support for NAS to FvwmAudio?  This would greatly improve performance
for NAS users.

Is this pixmap-support under development already? 
And what about the Mac-stylish WindowShade function? 
Is it possible to bind a key to mouse buttons? I know it is easy to bind
e.g. Ctrl-Meta-Left to move the mouse pointer to left, but I would like 
to have a key combination that would press a mouse button too! It would 
be really nice in Netscape, cut&paste in xterms etc. when mouse isn't in 
reach of the hand.. Maybe it is possible even now, I am not certain, but 
if it isn't, please add it!

As an inspiration of a _GREAT_ looking window system, check out the 
following URL (it will be possible to make FVWM look like this when the 
pixmap support is done ;-)):

This is an old one, the order of libraries in the makefile is incorrect,
-lfvwm should be first.

I have been reading through the more obscure modules now that I am 
familiar with Fvwm2 and was impressed with FvwmForm.
Its a pity that I can't think of anything more useful than a logout
button! Does anyone have any particularly useful, "Didn't know I 
needed one until I had it" applications for this?

After reading about FvwmPrompt however I feel that it is just a subset 
of FvwmForm and could probably be dropped from the release without too
much bother, its very easy to duplicate that functionality in FvwmForm
and there is no real need for a whole separate module. Or am I missing
something?

Its useful enough but there is a richer module doing the same thing
released with it. YMMV.

And a stupid question : when does FVWM become non-beta? Is it 'real
soon now' or actually not far off?

well I always wanted sth like xlock, but not only -allowroot, but allowing
EVERY valid user on the system. But instead of letting them into my
account, it should log me out first ("quit fvwm").
i.e: some sort of login mask, that logs me into my currently running
desktop session (again), or allowing any other user to log me out, and use
my workstation, if he's in need.

(don't know how to handle the password read (trustfully), but anything else
should be doable.)

This has nothing to do with fvwm.  Your /etc/termcap file, or the
/usr/lib/terminfo/ directory is missing the terminal information for
xterms apparently.  Try setting the environment variable TERM to be
'vt100' instead and see if it likes that.

The next release will be out as soon as I can get it out there.  I
wanted to release it today, but didn't get a chance to do as much with
fvwm this weekend as I wanted.  It'll be ready soon though (whatever
'soon' means).

Take a look at the web sites in the FAQ.  One (or several) of them
include configuration examples, and there is an ftp site with lots of
config examples cited on one of them.

Also, I plan to beef up the sample one before the first official
release.

     TogglePage
          Temporarily disables edge scrolling. Edge scrolling can
          be re-enabled by calling this again.

was very convenient to be put under a button in my buttonbar to temporarily
disable paging, when doing some CAD stuff.

Using: 
EdgeScroll 0 0
EdgeScroll my_normal_params
would use up two buttons (or both the click & the doubleclick function of
one button - if the doubleclick option worked, that is :) )

Missing it desparately - sniff.

Nope - sorry.  And it won't be until after the first official release
most likely.  I'd much rather get some bugs fixed and docs cleaned up
first.

Nope, not yet.  See above comment.  Unless someone else wants to take
a stab at this module sooner.

We've discussed this here before, but I guess I should put this in the
FAQ as well.

Making fvwm generate ButtonPress events is ok in theory, but a lot of
applications ignore events marked SYNTHETIC, which these would be.  If
I get a chance, I'll experiment with it, but I can't promise anything
(it is on the TO-DO list, BTW).

I hate making all these negative responses, so I'd better redeem
myself with a positive one: If you'd like to do cut-n-paste via
keystrokes though, you can do that now via xcb.  Grab it from
ftp.x.org or your favorite mirror.

What URL?  It was missing from the note and I'd be curious to see it.

Restoring has been on the TO-DO list.  More than enough people have
missed it to warrant that...

Just a guess, but make sure that you are actually invoking FvwmBacker
during startup.

Here is a patch against 2.0.40, a sample implementation of TogglePage
based on the code of fvwm-1.24r.

Some of you may have noticed that it is not hard to add functions to
fvwm. TogglePage isn't the ideal example, because it tinkers with
a few functions outside of its own execution, but I'll go on anyway.....

Most unix systems these days have the option to dynamically load object
files to a running program (gnu:dld, sun: dlopen/sym/etc, OSF1:dlopen/sym/etc)
has anyone thought of making most of the functions dynamically loaded modules?
They could be loaded on demand - if you don't find a function, you can
dynamically load it if you can locate its .o file.

I thought of doing this a long time ago, but it adds complexity to
the build-process - since you need to accomodate systems that lack the
dl* functions.

I've thought about this from time to time, since I implemented dynamic
loading (under AIX, SunOS, Solaris, and HP-UX) in the program that I
work on for my job, and it's been extremely handy in our product.

But I thought that the module implementation was probably more than
good enough for fvwm (although perhaps some additions to the protocol
might be useful) and more portable, so I didn't persue it much past
thinking "hey, that might be cool".

Making it portable might not be too bad.  It could be done with
generic interfaces to the dynamic load functions, files with specific
implementations, and some defines and stub functions for systems that
hadn't been ported to yet.  It would probably be easier doing it via
AutoConf instead of Imake as well.

Well, I'll add it to the TO-DO list to investigate at some point.  I'd
be able to cover Linux, AIX, SunOS, Solaris, and HP-UX.

I'm running SunOS 4.1.4 on a Sparc 2 with a Type 4 keyboard.  I can't seem to

live without the arrow keys for stuff like vi, but what do I do about DOOM???
Any suggestions or fixes would be greatly appreciated......

Sounds like you probably need a keymap file.  Unfortunately, I have a type 5
keyboard and not a type 4, so I'm not sure if my keymap file will work for
you.  I'll include it below anyway, just in case.

Just stick this file in your home directory and call it ".KEYMAP" or something
like that.  Then, at the top of your .xinitrc file, put the following line:

xmodmap $HOME/.KEYMAP

If you figure out the right keycodes for your arrow keys, you should be able
to get them working this way.

Now, I have a question for you.  Where did you get the version of DOOM that
runs on SunOS 4.1.4?  The Solaris 2.4 version was the only DOOM that I knew
of that ran on SUNs.

when i start some applications by clicking on one of the FvwmButton buttons, it
doesn't pop back up.  For example the following buttons don't pop back up even
after i close the applications.

*FvwmButtons MXterm	xterm.xpm	Exec "Mxterm" 	mxterm -sb -fg white
-bg gray45

*FvwmButtons NxPr	mytypewr.xpm   	Exec "NxPr" 	nxpr -fg white -bg

RTFM.  From the FvwmButtons.man file:

               If command is an fvwm Exec command, then the button
               will remain pushed in until a window whose name or
               class matches the qouted portion of the command is
               encountered. This is intended to provide visual
               feedback to the user that the action he has requested
               will be performed. If the qouted portion contains no
               characters, then the button will pop out immediately.
               Note that users can continue pressing the button, and
               re-executing the command, even when it looks "pressed
               in."

Use FvwmIdent to find out what the Name (or Class) of the windows are
and make sure that is what you put in the "" of the Exec.

It's also question #10 in the FAQ.

I've been using FVWM for several months, and I love it!  I run 2.0.40
under IRIX 5.3 and Solaris 2.4.  Everything I need seems to work.  The
only nagging problem I have is that every time I restart, I get
various errors like this:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2000002

Is there anything I should do about it?

Hi all,

I'm trying to get fvwm version 2 working. I'm on a sun sparc, SunOS 4.1.
When I run fvwm, I get the following error:
	ld.so: libX11.so.4: not found

I have a libX11.so.4.3, so I made a symbolic link to libX11.so.4, but
still got the same error. I don't know much about this stuff. Is it
looking in the wrong directory for the library?

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom

Simple answer: loadlib

Explanitory answer:

Under SunOS, the location of shared libraries is stored in a cache file 
called /etc/ld.so.cache. The cache fileneeds to be rebuilt whenever a 
shared library is added to the system. If you get an error like: ld.so: 
libX11.so.4.20: no found the shared library cache needs to be updated. 
runnind the ldconfig command (as root) should fix your problem. 
Rebooting also works since ldconfig is run from /etc/rc.local at boot 
time (or it ought to be...)

Sometimes "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/X11/lib" (or wherever

Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately neither of these helped.
I don't know what the Idconfig Micah wrote about is, unless he meant
"Ifconfig". The following command is in my /etc/rc.local file:
	ifconfig -a netmask + broadcast + > /dev/null

I tried issuing that command - no luck. I tried rebooting - no luck.

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib:

ls -l /usr/openwin/lib/libX11.s*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root           13 Jul 30  1995 libX11.sa -> libX11.sa.4.3
-r--r--r--  1 root          714 Jan 17  1994 libX11.sa.4.3
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root           13 Jul 30  1995 libX11.so -> libX11.so.4.3
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root           13 Jan 30 15:29 libX11.so.4 -> libX11.so.4.3
-r--r--r--  1 root       270336 Apr  1  1993 libX11.so.4.3

Is there an easy way to link libX11 in statically? I know that would make
fvwm bigger but as a last resort...

Thanks again,
Tom

it is ldconfig (lowercase L as in lady) not Idconfig.... forgive me if I 
typed it wrong.

Ok,

The problem was the the LD_LIBRARY_PATH was not set until i ran openwin.
I set it in my .cshrc and got past that problem. 

Now I get:

fvwm: can't open display :0

I checked the documentation and FAQ and there is no entry for 
"now that I've compiled fvwm, how do I run it?"

Thanks for your patience,
Tom

(looking at the following after I wrote it, I realize I made several
assumptions about your local setup that may be incorrect.  If so, let
me know...)

When you start OpenWindows with the "openwin" command you usually get
the "olwm" window manager, which is started from /usr/openwin/lib/Xinitrc.
Something that might work would be to copy that file to ~/.xinitrc and
change the three lines that start olwm:
   sleep 15 & pid=$!                       # OpenLook Window Manager
   olwm -syncpid $pid &
   wait $pid                               # Pause until olwm inits
to a line that starts fvwm instead:
   fvwm &
I think you need to make .xinitrc executable ("chmod 0700 ~/.xinitrc")
though I'm not certain... this is all based on my old setup from back in
the Dark Ages when I too was stuck with OpenWindows (spit).

It may be helpful to start OpenWindows with a command like
   openwin >& openwin-errs
so you can look at the file "openwin-errs" if things go wrong and you'll
at least have some idea what the error messages are.

Something else that might help would be to see if anyone else where you
work has startup files (.xinitrc, .openwin-init, etc) that you can use
as a starting point.  That's what a lot of us do... I think there are
probably only about 12 original .xinitrc files in the world... :-)

Hi,

  I'm trying to get Netscape to run from the GoodStuff window. I keep on 
getting the message "/bin/sh: netscape00: Permission denied" in my 
.xsession-errors file and Netscape doesn't  run. 
  The permisions for Netscape on our system are restricted. Only poeple 
on the "netters" group are allowed to use it. The permissions are as follows:

r-x--x---   root  netters ...

  I run Netscape from the shell prompt with no problems, so I don't really 
have a permission problem of any kind.
  I did manage to get Netscape to work from GoodStuff by changing the 
permissions so that everybody has execute permission (r-x--x--x). 

  Is this a bug? a hidden feature? :-)

You most certainly do have a permission problem or you wouldn't get a
permission denied message :-) Seriously, do you run xdm?  If so, it
may not be setting up your supplementary groups before fvwm gets
started.  I ran into this problem with some versions of xdm in the
past myself, but haven't used xdm for a while so I'm not sure if it's
still there.

All this talk of netscape reminds me:

I use netscape from my button bar with no problems, but a friend uses it on an NCD terminal
and on his it runs fine but all helper apps come up with something like 
sh:xv cannot exec or similar.

I have no idea why, any help or similar help appreciated.

It runs fine from an xterm but not from the buttons. However I tried to run it
through an xterm (exec xterm -e netscape and so on) but nothing helps.

I've just found out that we are moving to Solaris 2.5 over the weekend so I'll have to 
recompile fvwm2 again probably. Agh!

If you are starting your X session from xdm, I've noticed that it
doesn't set up all your supplementary groups correctly. If you're
starting xterms with your login environment, that would be why netscape
works from them.

Try setting up a menu item to call xterm with the +/- ls option set for
a non-login shell and use id to see what's up.

There is a particular feature of Openwindows that I really miss.  I would
be happy to take on the job of adding it to Fvwm if the consensus is
that it would be a Good Thing (tm).

The topic is: the behavior of window resizing with the mouse.

With fvwm, and other twm like window managers, dragging the window corner
resizes the window in both the X and Y directions.

With olwm/olvwm, this resize behavior is modified by holding the shift
button (or was it control?) so the window is only resized in either
the X or Y direction.  In other words, the resizing is constrained 
to occur along only one axis.  I always found this very helpful, especially
for resizing windows I want to maintain at 80 columns wide, like xterm
or mailtool windows.

Thoughts?

Personally, I like fvwm's behaviour better.  When I need to resize a window
in only one direction, I grab the side of the window instead of the corner.
If that's not default behaviour for fvwm let me know and I'll poke through
my .fvwmrc and see what I did to set it up that way...

Grab and drag the top or bottom and it'll resize only vertically; grab
and drag the left or right and it'll resize only horizontally.

Grab the corners and it'll resize in both axis.

I think it makes much more sense that way than having to use a shift (or
was it control?) :)

I have this in my .fvwmrc:

Mouse	1	FS	A	Function "Resize-or-Raise"

And this in my .fvwm2rc:

Mouse	1	FS	A	Resize-or-Raise

If you're only able to resize when grabbing the corners I suspect
your line says "F" where mine says "FS".  I think I added the "S" to mine
when I was making it work the way SGI's "4Dwm" works...

i like for my windows to be placed from top to bottom on the left side of
the screen then to the right as it gets full.  default for fvwm places 
across the top left to right, then down.

anyway, i made the following trivial change to fvwm/placement.c

i am not suggesting that this be the default.  i think it would be nice 
to have this type of option in the config file.

Thanks, Aaron!  I was just poking about with that the other day, but got
distracted before I found a solution.  Perhaps a "WindowGravity" option
in the .fvwmrc?  If we wanted to get really snazzy, it could be a
"Style" option...

A WindowGravity option that affects SmartPlacement (and perhaps
RandomPlacement too) might not be a bad idea.  I think I'll add it to
the TO-DO list for the time being.

As for making it a Style option, I don't know.  It certainly cannot
even be considered until the "Great Style Flag Rewrite" (to allow >32
style options) that I plan to do shortly after the first official
release, whenever I actually manage to get that out... ;^)

The FAQ can be found in the current 2.xx source distribution.  In case
you don't know, the source can be found at ftp.hpc.uh.edu in
/pub/fvwm/version-2/.

Just so everyone knows: I'm also preparing an official WWW page where
I plan to keep HTMLized versions of various docs, like the FAQ.  An
incomplete version will be available shortly.  Stay tuned...

Hmmm... isn't this in the FAQ yet?  It ought to be... happens on
all sorts of platforms including IRIX 4-6 and Linux.

The fix is to change the ordering of the libraries in the cc command,
so that ../libs/libfvwm.a comes before -lX11.

Ok.. here is  a patch to makefile.h which will correct the problem when
compiling fvwm2 under Linux.

I will put the patch onto a ftp site since this seems to be requested often.

Shouldn't libfvwm come before all other libraries on _every_
architecture?  That just seems like a bug in the Imakefile or whatever.

Seems like it ought to come before libXpm, as well... in short, it
should be the very first library.

Hi,

I'm having a problem with 2.034 on an IBM RS/6000 using AIX 3.2.5.
When selecting menus from different applications (Framemaker,xemac,xterm ...)
on occasions the menu will hide behind the application itself , thus making
menu selection impossible. The only way out is to release the menu and
try again.

This was also happening with 1.23r ...

Thanks !

I didn't put it in the FAQ, because (as I've posted several times)
it'll be fixed in the next release, and since the FAQ is in the
release, that wouldn't do a lot of good.  It's just taking me a bit
longer than anticipated to get that next release out.

As I also said earlier today, I'm setting up an official FVWM WWW page
and in the future I'll put "temporary" things like this in there.

I wouldn't bother, since it will be fixed in the next version (soon)
and we'll still have to point people to the patch, which is small
enough that we might as well just post that.

This is a known problem, that I think I need to put in the FAQ.  This
should only be happening when you are clicking on the menubar and FVWM
needs to raise the window too.  Motif menus are done via
OverrideRedirect windows, which are ignored by FVWM.  They are coming
up before FVWM has a chance to raise the window, so then they get
obscured by the window.  I'm not sure if there is a way to prevent
this or not, but I'll look into it again.

Also, 2.0.34 was a very buggy version.  I'd suggest grabbing 2.0.40
from the new official site (ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/fvwm/version-2/).

That is the default behavior, and I prefer it this way myself.

I think so too.  Pretty confusing.

But I *might* be able to add another function that could be bound to
the corners w/ a modifier (like shift or control) to get the behavior
Gregory wants.  I'm not making any promises, but I might be able to.
If it's not real easy to add, I don't think it'd be worth it.

Hello,

I don't know whether or not this is a bug but I think I should report
it:

Windows that have the following style (xclock in this example)

Style "xclock" NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 6

have a resize problem:  you cannot make the window smaller *before*
making it a little bit larger.  That is, if you try to resize it and
make it smaller, the frame will not change unless you try to move the
mouse in the opposite direction first.

This problem doesn't occur with other windows.  Is this a bug?  I will
investigate this further tomorrow, to find out exactly which is the
style causing this.


Tudor

Thank you to all who replied.  I should have realized this was one of
those things that fvwm is already so good at.  I had my mouse bound
to "move-or-raise" like this:
Mouse  1        TS      A       Move-or-Raise

So I switched it to invoke resizing with the shift key held:
Mouse   1       T       A       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       N       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       C       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       M       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       S       Resize-or-Raise

------------------------
I found another problem in this process.  Why does this work:
Mouse   1       S       N       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       C       Move-or-Raise
Mouse   1       S       M       Move-or-Raise

But this does not work:
Mouse   1       S       NCM     Move-or-Raise

ok.  You can do this.  You can also, as a non-root user, set an environment
variable 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' to any paths that should be searched for
libraries.
