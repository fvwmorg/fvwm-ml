H'lo all,

	I just downloaded and compiled Fvwm 2.0.43, and I have a stupid 
question: How do I run it? Did it change /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm to be the 
current version? I don't think it did, coz using my old .xinitrc with the
simple `fvwm' command near the bottom starts up my old version (1.23b). I'm 
confused. Please reply via private mail to jabbott@nyx.net, so as to avoid
bogging up the listserv with essentially pointless messages. Thanx in advance.

Truth until paradox,
Jeff

Hi, 
I have tried to install fvwm-2.0.42, but it won't. I must be doing some
thing wrong. I have installed RedHat 3.0.3 with linux 2.0. I have gcc/g++ 
2.7.2, etc. 
I have the following questions: 
1. when I type xmkmf or ./MakeMakefiles, it just prints one line 
    is it normal? 
2. when I type make , it starts some nonsense, and I tried to read some of
the fast scrolling text, everything ends with a stop. 
3. Is there an error free version of fvwm-2.x. 
4. Could some one help me install it, i.e. send me a step by step process. 
5. I would appreciate if you could send me a copy of your configure.h and
fvwm.tmpl files. 
I would appreciate your help.

At my work, we are using a SS5 with _three_ monitors and Xvan. I installed
Fvwm 2.0.42 on it the other day, (just when I was about to puke over olwm 
and twm). Everything is working out fine. I can reccomend this
configuration, it's really nice with such a big workspace.

There is just one small strange thing: when I'm resizing or placing a
window, some of the lines from the grid extends to the upper corners of
all the tree monitors.  I haven't seen this on any of the other wm's (but
on the other hand, I'm trying not to look at olwm :)

Anyone got an idea about what to do? Could this be fixed in 2.0.43?

I dunno about a fix, but I experienced the same thing when I used XVan
on my three monitors.  (Solaris 2.5, R6, 2.0.42)

BTW, there's a focus "bug" with multiple monitors (using sloppyfocus):

1.  Have focus in a window on monitor 1 - window has HilightColor.

2.  Move mouse to root window on monitor 2, keeping focus in window on
    monitor 1 - window loses HilightColor but still has focus.

3.  Move mouse back to same window on monitor 1 - window still has
    focus without HilightColor.

Yup, I just found it:

I don't think the problem is XEmacs related -- it does the same thing
using xterm and netscape.

These problems make me wonder whether or not fvwm knows that the
cursor has moved to another monitor.  Does it?

I need some help.  I'm running fvwm 2.41 and have tried to set up my pixmap path using:

#Path for Pixmaps
PixmapPath /home/lmyers/pixmaps:/home/lmyers/bitmaps

but I keep getting the error:


fvwm: No such module /home/lmyers/bin/fvwm2.Modules PixmapPath

It's probably somthing simple but I can't seem to see it.

Could any help me.

Hi,

I often use the keyboard to navigate the pointer, but have not

what the syntax is for that?  Thanks in advance,

(Warning: horrid ugly poorly-explained details ahead.  Casual fvwm users
probably won't benefit from reading them--this report is intended for
the programmers on the list who are fairly intimate with the source
code.)

placement.c seems to have a subtle bug in the code to avoid placing a
window offscreen.  The behaviour is harder to explain than it is to
fix....

To reproduce the bug: turn on SmartPlacement, and arrange the desktop so
that the next window to be placed should be near (but not touching) the
bottom edge of the screen, where "near" means "within roughly a distance
equal to twice the height of a window's titlebar."

For instance: if your xterm windows are 350 pixels high including
decorations, and your TitleFont is a 16 point font, arrange the desktop
so that there's roughly, say, 370-380 pixels of open space between the
bottom of an existing window and the bottom edge of the screen; then
create another xterm.

The window gets created at the bottom of the screen instead of just
under the bottom edge of the other window. 

(A similar bug exists for horizontal placement, but it's easier to
exhibit for vertical placement.

English is the wrong language to try to explain the bug, so I'll put it
in terms of the source code...

ll. 201-215 of placement.c:

201|  if(tmp_win->frame_x + tmp_win->frame_width +
202|     2*tmp_win->boundary_width> Scr.MyDisplayWidth)
203|    {
204|      tmp_win->attr.x = Scr.MyDisplayWidth -tmp_win->attr.width
205|	- tmp_win->old_bw +tmp_win->bw - 2*tmp_win->boundary_width;
206|      Scr.randomx = 0;
207|    }
208|  if(tmp_win->frame_y + 2*tmp_win->boundary_width+tmp_win->title_height
209|     + tmp_win->frame_height > Scr.MyDisplayHeight)
210|    {
211|      tmp_win->attr.y = Scr.MyDisplayHeight -tmp_win->attr.height
212|	- tmp_win->old_bw +tmp_win->bw - tmp_win->title_height -
213|	  2*tmp_win->boundary_width;;
214|      Scr.randomy = 0;
215|    }

I believe that the problem is that tmp_win->frame_width includes the
2*tmp_win->boundary_width, so they don't need to be re-added into the
calcluation; likewise for tmp_win->frame_height and
2*tmp_win->boundary_width and tmp_win->title_height.  The fix is to
simply remove those terms from the assignments.

Also, at ll.34-37, I think both comparisons should be '<=' instead of '<':

34|  while(((test_y + temp_h) < (Scr.MyDisplayHeight))&&(!loc_ok))
35|    {
36|      test_x = 0;
37|      while(((test_x + temp_w) < (Scr.MyDisplayWidth))&&(!loc_ok))

By disallowing the equality, SmartPlacement isn't allowed to place
windows touching the right side or the bottom edge of the screen.


(The SmartPlacement() routine could also use some optimization.  I'm
thinking about writing a more efficient version of that routine which,
in addition to being smarter about where to try to place windows,
could optionally look for a "pretty good" place to put a window
if it couldn't find a place which didn't overlap any windows at all;
"pretty good" means it would use a combination of strategies such as (a)
overlap the smallest region possible, or a reasonable approximation; (b)
try to avoid overlapping other window's titlebars; (c) try to avoid
positions where it would completely obscure some other window; and/or
(d) try to balance the windows so there aren't some regions covered by
eight overlapping windows and other regions with one.  Some people might
prefer such educated guesses for window placement to simply falling back
to RandomPlacement.  In any case, it's extremely doubtful that such a
patch would make it for 2.1.0, even if there's another beta between now
and then.)

you should define a function and use this for the action.

i use this (with rmail) to create a new frame with a FIXED title.
(if window-system		; default/new frame
       (defvar rmail-frame nil
	 "frame where mail should be displayed")

       (defadvice rmail (before rmail-use-rmail-frame
			  (&optional file-name-arg) preact act comp)
	 "goto rmail-frame, create new frame, if there is none"
	       (or (and rmail-frame
			(frame-live-p rmail-frame))
		   (setq rmail-frame (new-frame '((name . "Rmail")
					(menu-bar-lines . 1)
					(mini-buffer . t)
					(width . 82) (height . 60)
				        (left . -1) (top . 0) ))))
	       (select-frame rmail-frame)))

you can then use the window (frame) title to go to that window.

This depends on the line :-)  My system prints two lines, which

mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -I/usr/openwin/lib/config

I think your Imake is broken.  Or, maybe you have made a mistake in
editing Fvwm.tmpl?  I have installed 2.0.42 which works just fine.

Here's what I did for 2.0.42:

  - edited Fvwm.tmpl to my liking
  - typed xmkmf
  - typed make Makefile
  - typed make Makefiles
  - typed make
  - typed make install
  - typed make install.man

  Arshad> 5. I would appreciate if you could send me a copy of your

I'd rather not, because this is a *very* nonstandard Solaris
installation -- the fvwm binary is not installed in /usr/bin, or
/usr/bin/X11, or /usr/X11/bin, or /usr/openwin/bin, or /usr/local/bin,
or something like this.

Subject: FVWM: Small patch to FvwmPager for the button-impaired
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha9-jlt1

Hi all,

FVWM is a great piece of software and the best window manager around.
There's a single nagging bit with FvwmPager and the fact that my machine
is a notebook with a PS/2 trackpoint and only 2 mouse buttons. The
button semantics of FvwmPager is hard-coded, and moving windows is
associated with dragging with mouse button 2 down. Under XFree86, button
2 is emulated by pressing both buttons, which is quite a pain. I know I
could have tweaked the Xmodmap to reorder the button, but that would
break the other applications' interface.

So, after this lengthy introduction, here's a tiny patch to FvwmPager.
What it does is add a config option *FvwmPagerSwapButtons to swap
buttons 3 and 2. When that option is specified in .fvwmrc, moving
windows is mapped to button 3 drag and positioning the screen is mapped
to button 2. Additionally, focus without screen change is mapped to
button 3 click. That's it.

It's really a quick hack that isn't destined to get into the official
source. I think I read somewhere sometime ago that a more flexible
button mapping configuration parser was planned for FvwmPager. Until
then, this patch could help the button-impaired. It helps my poor
fingers a lot. :-)

To apply the patch, do "diff < patch.swapbuttons" in the
modules/FvwmPager directory.

I think there is a problem with FvwmButtons.c:1105 when an invalid
font is specified.  Specifically, the if statement checks ub->font,
but then uses ub->c->font. I do not know enough about it to know which
is right. I ub->c->just changed my font specification to be correct. 

  if(ub->font)
    {
      gcv.font = ub->c->font->fid;
      gcm |= GCFont; 
    }

I got a core dump under FreeBSD 2.1.0, but didn't under Solaris 2.5.

I know it's been a few weeks, but getting back to this problem - I
think I missed one little thing that could cause the timing bug if
you're starting w/ FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp, which I don't know since I
couldn't access the URL which you specified as containing your
..fvwm2rc file.

I've really got to walk through all the code and verify all of the
server grabs and ungrabs too, but I think this is the last big
problem...  Whoops!  Spoke too soon - just found one more potential
problem.

Ok, please try applying this patch on top of the one I already sent:

fvwm95-2 crashes if I have the mini-icons available.

If I rename the mini-icons directory so that the bitmap
files cannot be found, fvwm starts fine.  I was told that
this is probably due to the version of libXpm I am using.
LibXpm versions 4.3 and 4.6 are supposed to work fine, but
I cannot find them... The latest version I have been able
to locate is 3.4h.   Does anybody know of a libXpm version
of 4.3 or 4.6??

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hallo!

I don't want any FvwmPagerLabel. Can I specify that?

Will FVWM ever be able to move windows from the pager like olvwm?
I mean, button 2 of the mouse only moves the little square, I'd like
to move the real window in real time.


All The Best,
 Marco

I appear to be able to reliably crash the FvwmPager by using Button2 to
drag the little windows in the pager across desktops.  My FvwmPager is
started using FvwmPager 0 1, and I try moving the little window across
desktops.

I don't see any mention of this bug in BUGS... does anyone else observe
this behaviour?

Thanks
Greg

Hmmm. My web server was down for about a day a couple of weeks ago, and
the fvwm2rc file was missing for a few days after that, but it is there
now. Just in case I put the URL down incorrectly, here it is again

http://dosa.ini.cmu.edu/~manojk/fvwm2rc

I just verified this in Lynx, so you should be able to access it. I am
using FvwmCpp.

No luck... Still getting the same Style problems as before with the
starting rxvt. :(

If I get a chance, I will try to reformat the fvwm2rc so it doesn't need
FvwmCpp, and report on what happens.

Hi all.

I've just installed fvwm2.0.43 on a BSD system, it's compiled satisfactorily.
But then, when I run 'restart fvwm2', the window just hang up :-(.

Does anyone have any idea what's happening here?

I would greatly appreciate anyone's comments.

Can you help me please.

As the subject says.  Can I? How do I? 

-Use the systems hilights, shadow and relief colours in a XPM format?
   The idea here is to make my own shape/design buttons.

-Swallow Winlist into a FvwmButton? 
   The objective here is to make my own style Winlist bar.

-Raise the the FvwmButton bar by a Button, moving the mouse to a specific area,
  by a key binding. 

-Hide and unhide the FvwmButton bar.

Also I'm looking for a good system monitoring app with at least load, memory
and swap to use with Fvwm2. Graphical display would be nice.
Could you please recommend one (some). I value your opinion.


Oh! My system Linux2.0 Redhat Fvwm2.0.43

Thanks for your attention and time from a cool wet downunder.
Murray

Cheers!

Here is a short and sweet question...  I use fvwm 2.0.43 in Click to
Focus mode.  How can I get fvwm not to raise the window I click in
unless the click is on the border or titlebar like fvwm 1.X could do ?

Regards, and thanks in advance.

You can drag a little window in the pager onto the current real-life desk.

Oh. I don't know about this. One day when I have 5 minutes spare I'm
going to go and learn about how the module interface works. In the
meantime, anyone else? ...

 I found it in /pub/linux/ELF of ftp.ctd.comsat.com.
It's file name is xpm-3.4f.bin.ELF.tar.gz.
 I hope it would help you.

I just downloaded the latest fvwm (2.0.43), to upgrade from 2.0.41. 
Everything works fine except placement.  Despite not having
SmartPlacement and ActivePlacement defined and having

Style "*"           NoPPosition

All my windows are getting placed automatically instead of letting me
place them myself.

I can't find any documentation that this has changed so any ideas
friends?

Thanks

I believe that libXpm 4.7 == 3.4g. So is it reasonable to suppose that
4.8 == 3.4h ???

  -> DDA:RFC-822=3Dfvwm(a)hpc.uh.edu; P=3DINTERNET; A=3DSIL; C=3DSE

I'd like to report a problem I have with fvwm.

Machine: Pentium CPU
OS: FreeBSD v. 2.1.0-RELEASE
X: XFree86 v. 3.1.2
fvwm-version: 2.0.42

fvwm was configured using the defaults in configure.h and
Fvwm.tmpl (nothing changed, except the paths for X executables
and includes which are under /usr/X11R6/... in XFree86 3.1.2)
Then xmkmf; make makefiles; make all
The compiler, which is gcc 2.6.3, gets the flags -m486 -O2 when
compiling.
The symptom:
FvwmWinList does not get properly updated when creating new
windows. I think the size of the winlist increases to reflect
the increased number of windows, but the list itself is
completely blank (no labels, no buttons). Unfortunately, the
problem does not seem to be 100 % reproducible; on a few
occasions, FvwmWinList was updated correctly, but in 99 % of the
tries, bringing up a new window (such as the typical xterm or
emacs window) results in a blank FvwmWinList. It remains blank
until one presses one of the buttons/labels in the list, or does
something else that affects FvwmWinList, such as minimising a
window.
  The problem seems to occur more often when using
SmartPlacement/RandomPlacement in .fvwm2rc than when actively
placing the windows (DumbPlacement/ActivePlacement in .fvwm2rc).
Hope this information is useful. If you need additional info,
please mail me directly as I am not on the list currently.
                                       Erik

Hello and thank's for continuing FVWM.

I can't seem to be able to edge scroll in a horizontal direction.
I can go up and down, but no left right.
I have nine virtual screens ( if that makes a difference), but other
then that my set up is pretty standard.

Thanks Nate

Change your Style command to be: 
	Style "*"	NoPPosition, ActivePlacement,  DumbPlacement 

The default placement styles are now SmartPlacement and RandomPlacement.
 I think I ended up looking at the code to figure this out for sure. 
The help text isn't real clear on default values in a couple of places
and this maybe one of them.  I believe Chuck has been updating the help
for 2.0.

Hello all, 
	Does anyone know what happen from .42 to .43 when you, I believe, 
warp to a window, that the cursor does not goto the upper left hand coner 
of the selected window.  
	For example, I select a window from winlist.  Under .42 it would 
warp to that window and the cursor would be in the upper left hand 
corner.  Now under .43 the window is focused, but the cursor is not in 
the ULHC.  What happened.  The Changelog only talks about WarpToWindow, 
What am I lacking?
					Thanks,
					Jason

The Focus function has been split in two.

Old behavior:
  Focus warps the mouse pointer into the window and gives the window
  focus.

New behavior:
  Focus gives the window focus, WarpToWindow warps the mouse pointer
  into the window (without giving focus -- but there may be a side
  effect with MouseFocus).

I am having a problem installing FVWM2.0.43 on a SUNOS system.
 
after I do: xmkmf
            make Makefiles
	    make
with no problems...I then type: make install
and get the following compiler errors in misc.c and FvwnIconMan.c:

misc.c: In function `fvwm_msg':
misc.c:892: `__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use this function)
misc.c:892: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once

FvwmIconMan.c:96: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once

I'm using gcc compiler.

Any suggestions?

Hello again,

i just realized that I am using WindowList and not FvwmWinList.  I get 
the two confused.  It seems that is the problem.  So whats the fix.  
Apparently, er should I say according to the docs, that is the default 
behaviour for WindowList.  But is seems not, at least after .42.  I tried 
setting that as a Style.... Nope.  Might this be a tiny buglet, or a SUE 
(Stupid User Error)?

					A very long time fvwm user,
					Jason

There's a side affect with Focus now too.  At least I see that using
WindowList to select another window does indeed move the focus to
it... temporarily.  It quickly reverts to the window with the cursor.

I've been working on my new Python module for Fvwm and I'm hitting
some weird behavior with standard I/O.  FTR: fvwm 2.0.43, Solaris 2.5,
OW 3.5, and Python 1.3.

Say I want to do a Send_ConfigInfo and print out all the lines that
come back.  I use Python's `print' command which should send the
output to sys.stdout.  But when I do this, I get the first part of the
first line, and then garbage or only random intermediate bits of the
rest of the output.  So I try to run the script with `python -u' for
unbuffered output and that helps, a little, but it's still not very
good.

I even try flushing sys.stdout after every print but that doesn't
help.  Seems the only way to actually see every output character is to
crack open a log file and write() the characters to it (with flushes).

So what's happening to stdout that the Module documentation isn't real
revealing?  Anybody know what I need to do in my module to get output
to work?

Thanks,
-Barry

Is the archive search not working?  Hmmm, no it seems to be fine.  A search
for "title;bar;pixmap;patch" shows a bunch of nice references, including

We used to have a similar problem with our products build.  Try defining
__EXTENSION__.  It did resolve that problem for us may it will for you too.

Damn.

Ok, this can be fixed, but we now have another problem - how to do it
and keep everyone happy.

Currently The built in window list has hard coded call to 'Raise_it'
(a built in function especially for the built in winlist it seems)
when it builds the menu.

I think I should make it call something like WinListFunc instead, and
make that be an interpreted function (with a default built up inside
of fvwm that just calls Focus and uniconifies if necessary).  That way
WinListFunc could be added to or destroyed and recreated just like any
other interpreted function, and if people need or want the warp in
there (or would rather have the winlist execute a FvwmIdent or
something else) that could be added.

Does this solution sound acceptable to everyone?  It might be
overkill, but I'd hate to just put an explicit warp in there and have
lots of people yell about it again.

Chuck

Another success story!

I was able to compile fvwm2 on a DEC UDB (233MHz Alpha) running RedHat
Linux 3.0.3.  I did have to comment out 

#define NEEDS_ALPHA_HEADER

in the configure.h file. All else went fine!

Thanks to all.

I have searched the archives and the FAQ, but can't find an answer to this
question:  Is it possible to assign a different colormap to each virtual
desktop?  I would like to have netscape running on one desktop, using as
many colors as it needs, WordPerfect running on another desktop, using as
many colors as it needs, etc...; with each desktop maintaining it's own
8-bit color table.  Is this possible?

Thanks,

Just a silly question: is fvwm2 in your path (i.e., in the path of the
shell that launches fvwm2)?

Hello everyone..

I recently downloaded fvwm and untarred it..I didnt know how to
configure. I already have twm running in my SUN Sparc machine.

I think the INSTALL file is rather clear.
untar fvwm, then edit Fvwm.tmpl and config.h (there are comments in
it, so you'll know what to put in there), then type xmkmf, then make
Makefiles, then make, then make install, then make install.man.

(I didn't need to edit config.h, so you should start editing Fvwm.tmpl
first, then only if something doesn't work look at config.h.)

hth,

Howdy all,

I just installed Fvwm 2.0.42 on a Solaris 2.4 and I share the partition
with all my Solaris 2.4 machines. I have an Xterm command in my menu and
I would like to know how to set the -title to the name of the machine
I'm running the fvwm2 on.

TIA.

(1) You use FvwmCpp or FvwmM4 and use one of the predefined macros to
stick into the -title option.

(2) You execute a shell script that does xterm -title `hostname`.

Howdy (again!),

I never thought this was going top work but it did. I just used:

+ "Xterm" Exec exec xterm -title `hostname` -n `hostname` -e tcsh &

Directly in the .fvwm2rc file and... Tada! It's there.

Thanks to everybody who responded.

hello all,

after requests for rsynth support (needs spaces between words)
I've made a small patch for 2.0.43 and posted it to the list 
(it included the "string" patch). 

Now I found Mark Boyns patch for 2.0.43.
I reapplied my patches after his patch, and reworked some tiny bits so
that FvwmAudio now supports quoted parameters.

for details, see the ChangeLog.
I post the whole source file, since the context diff was just
marginally smaller, and I didn't want to send patches for plain 2.0.43
and 2.0.43 with Mark Boyns patch.

PS: Chuck: have a look at the WIBNI in the code.

I'll go and get some sleep now,
albrecht

/* ChangeLog

 * made FvwmAudio insensitive to its name -> can be symlinked.
   corrected some error message deficiencies, code for quoted 'sound' 
   parameters shamelessly stolen from FvwmButtons/parse.c (with minimal
   adjustments)
   FvwmAudio now supports rsynth's say command:
   *FvwmAudioPlayCmd say
   *FvwmAudio add_window	   "add window"      
   *FvwmAudio raise_window	   'raise window'
               -- 08/07/96 Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)

 * Fixed FvwmAudio to reflect the changes made to the module protocol.

 * Szijarto Szabolcs <saby@sch.bme.hu> provided FvwmSound code that used
 $HOSTDISPLAY for the rplay host.  The code has been added to FvwmAudio.

 * Fixed bugs reported by beta testers, thanks!

 * Builtin rplay support has been added to FvwmAudio.  This support is
 enabled when FvwmAudio is compiled with HAVE_RPLAY defined and when
 FvwmAudioPlayCmd is set to builtin-rplay.  I guess it's safe to say
 that FvwmSound is now obsolete. -- Mark Boyns 5/7/94
 
 * FvwmAudio is based heavily on an Fvwm module "FvwmSound" by Mark Boyns
 and the real credit for this really goes to him for the concept.
 I just stripped out the "rplay" library dependencies to allow generic
 audio play command support.

We all know Santa as a fat, jolly old man. Well, he may be fat and he
may be old, but he ain't always jolly. There was this one year when
Mrs. Claus decided she wanted to be a feminist, the reindeer went on
strike, and the elves sued because they wanted to be called
"vertically challenged toy manufacturers".
So Santa retreated to his office to rest, when an angel entered and
said, "Santa..."
"What do you want?" was the reply.
"Well," the angel answered,"The Christmas Tree arrived today."
"So?" Santa said.
"Well, I was wondering where you wanted me to put it."
And that, my friends, is why Angels sit on top of trees.

Hi,

I recently installed fvwm2.0.43 on a linux 2.0.0 box ,and everything is
mostly fine.
My one problem at the moment is that I can't get the m4 pre-processing
working.

I've tried putting

FvwmM4

at the top of my .fvwm2rc file, and also

FvwmM4 -debug

but I'm not seeing any files in /tmp.

I've also tried putting
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmM4

All of these options seem to fail silently, i.e fvwm starts up ok,
but the file doesn't seem to be pre-processed, for example SERVERHOST
stays as SERVERHOST.

If I put
fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 -debug /home/jbk/.fvwm2rc"
in my .xinitrc then things go badly wrong. fvwm doesn't start properly,
(the only menu entry is the builtin exit fvwm command), and the
console gives error messages that look like it's been trying to
load fvwm2 modules who's names are bits of binary. There's still no
files in /tmp.

I'm using m4 version 1.4, and it all seems to work fairly happily
with fvwm 1.??

Many thanks for any help you can offer,
James.

I'm using fvwm 2.0.43, and all of a sudden, I can't move any windows
around, and none of the close, maximize, or minimize buttons on the
windows do anything.

It's been working fine, and it _was_ working fine, and then suddenly I
went to move a window and fvwm didn't respond. Autofocus and autoraise
still work, fvwmbuttons still works, I can click on the desktop to get my
menus, but all clicks on the frame of a window just seem to be ignored.
I've restarted fvwm and still have the same problem.

I exited fvwm and restarted X, and now it's working properly again. I
don't know if this is a bug in X or fvwm..

I have been trying to install FVWM-2.0.43 on a SunOS system, and am running
into troubles while compiling.

I type: xmkmf
	make Makefiles
	make

and am getting errors in the modules misc.c and FvwmIconMan.c 

looks like this:

misc.c: In function 'fvwm_msg':
misc.c:892: '__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use this function)

FvwmIconMan.c: In function 'ConsoleMessage':
FvwmIconMan.c:72: '__builtin_va_alist' undeclared (first use this function)

I am using a gcc compiler.

Does anyone recognize this? How can I fix it?

someone suggested adding: _EXTENSION_ to my defines, but that didn't work.

	I was wondering if anyone has seen a problem with getting tons of
X-protocol error messages while running fvwm2.0.xx under Linux?  I've
determined the problem is definately fvwm on my end; none of my other window
managers exhibit this behavior.  It seems to happen randomly, but it happens
a lot.  This has been happening here since version 2.0.42 (which is the
first version I installed after 1.24) and I haven't been able figure out
where the problem is coming from.  If anyone would have any suggestions on
where to start looking I'd appreciate a tip or two.

	I'm currently running the XFree S3 server with 3.1.2E on Linux kernel
2.0.11 (but the version of the kernel never seemed to matter).  I recently
switched to an S3 Trio64V+ card from a Tseng W32 but I had the problems with
the W32 also. Thanks,  

          -Scott

Not exactly a fvwm question, but I figure someone here can answer 
this...

I use fvwm on Solaris and have occasion to use various 'suntool' 
apps.  Let's use shelltool as an example:
I am unable to 'paste' text from my xterm into the shelltool.  
Pressing the middle mouse button does nothing, nor does the 'Paste' 
keyboard button.  Pressing the 'Copy' button in the xterm causes a 
<ESC>[29~ to be sent to the app running on the xterm.

I can copy from the sheltool, though.  I select text in the shelltool 
and press 'Copy'.  Then in the xterm window, I can paste with either 
the middle mouse button, or the 'Paste' key.

Help! :^)

Not a fvwm question at all.  It's a "Sun's *tool programs are broken"
question.  Basically, they don't interoperate with anything else.  I'm
sure someone internal might be able to help you or something.
Otherwise, the stock answer is "Don't use cmdtool or shelltool."

I do encounter X errors when restarting fvwm with the FvwmButton Module.

Here's an example:
FvwmButtons: Cause of next X Error.
X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  12 (X_ConfigureWindow)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800003
  Serial number of failed request:  460
  Current serial number in output stream:  479

Don't know the cause of it though...

I thought that this would be in the mailing list archive.  Does this not happen
when you have something like the pager swallowed in the button bar?

I was hoping that this would be fixed in version 2.0.43.  Is it not?

I have another problem that I think might be related to this.  I use
xscreensaver as my locking program.  After unlocking my workstation first thing
in the morning, my FvwmButtons module is always dead and I have to restart it.

Does anyone else have this problem.

	I get the x-protocol errors with or without the pager swallowed.  It
happens a whole lot when I'm using Netscape, or opening and closing a lot of
windows.  

	As far as the FvwmButtons module locking up, I haven't encountered
that particular problem.  In fact, the only problem I've had at all is the
aforemention x-protocol problem.  Originally I attributed it to something in
my setup, but since TWM, CTWM, and OLVWM do not exhibit this behavior I have to
assume its FVWM..

Did you hit the num lock or scroll lock button by mistake?  Depending on
how you have defined your mouse and keypress events, toggling one of
these will cause certain events to be ignored. 

I'm not sure if restarting X will default these settings.  Mine doesn't
seem to but that doesn't mean anything. 

It's a guess,

I must have; hitting num lock duplicates the problem. Glad it's not a bug
in fvwm, just in my fvwm2rc :-)

I am not subscribed to this mailing list, so apologies if the following
"feature" is already known:
This applies to fvwm2
FvwmButtons follows an algorithm to place icons of various size within the
button bar. This fails in some cases, e.g.:

*FvwmButtonsRows 2

*FvwmButtons(2x2, ...)
*FvwmButtons( <whatever> )
*FvwmButtons( <whatever> )
*FvwmButtons(3x2, ...)
*FvwmButtons(2x2, ...)

This totals to 16 units, and with 2 rows, FvwmButtons allocates space for 8
columns. Now when it fills the icons in, it places the 2 single-unit icons
NEXT to each other in 2 columns instead of OVER one another in 1 column.
Therefore at the end, the width is 1 column short for the last button.
Same for 3 single-unit buttons: all three next to each other.
It works all right if the single-unit buttons are moved to the end, but that
is not where I like to have them.

        Any suggestions to a solution, patch, etc. appreciated (preferably
via e-mail):

I'm no expert but from what I remember, what you would want to do to get the two single buttons so that one is over the other, is to take the second single-unit button and place it at the end.  The reason this works is that it fills in the buttons on a row by row basis, and the single button on the end will fill the hole in the second row underneath the first single button.

I want to set up a button that will enlarge a window vertically to 50% of
the screen size, but not move it at all. It looks like if I do 
"Maximize 0 50" the windows are also moved up to the top of the screen,
which I do not want. The Resize command looks almost like I want, except I
only want to change the height of the window, not its width.

Is there any way that I can access some sort of variables inside a
function that correspond to the current height or width of a window?

    Right! Don't use cmdtool or shelltool, but if you need  to  paste
    something  in a mailtool or so on, you can add the following line
    in your .Xdefaults:

XTerm*vt100.Translations: #override \n\
            <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD) \n\
            <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n

    which will remap the copy and paste keys in a xterm.

	Hi There,

	We want to move from standard "mwm" to "fvwm" and for that we have 
to convert our .mwmrc to .fvwmrc. My question is how can I associate 
bitmaps to fvwm menu options?. i.e.: How do you translate this .mwmrc 
statement:

@/usr/local/cluster/bitmaps/shell.px f.exec "xterm &"

	into a .fvwmrc statement?

					Thanks in advance: Manuel

The algorithm used by FvwmButtons is to total up the numbers of buttons
and then work out the rows and columns to allocate.  It then fills up the
array in left to right, top to bottom order.  It is doing the right thing
to place the two single buttons next to each other.  In order to get
them above each other you need:

*FvwmButtons(2x2, ...)
*FvwmButtons( <whatever> )
*FvwmButtons(3x2, ...)
*FvwmButtons(2x2, ...)
*FvwmButtons( <whatever> )

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

  You can only add pixmaps in menu entries with fvwm2.

First you should set the pixmap path in the PixmapPath variable:

PixmapPath /my/pixmap/path/:/usr/local/cluster/bitmaps/
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And then this is the syntax in the AddToMenu function:

+	"Xterm%shell.px%"	Exec  xterm &
              ^^^^^^^^^^

Hope this help.

Sun's tools (cmdtool and shelltool) isn't broken
when we talk about copy-and-paste between them
and other programs.
Why ? because Sun uses a different mechanism for cut-and-paste.

Howdy mailing list,

I have just built fvwm 2.0.43 on solaris 2.5 with gcc. Works fine
except for xterm. Every time I exec from the menu, I get 

xterm: Error 14, errno 22: Invalid argument

Calling everything else from the menu, e.g. emacs, netscape, ... works
fine. Even when I remove all the arguments from xterm, i.e. 

+		    "Xterm"	    Exec xterm

I still get the error.

I looked up the source for xterm and I believe that Error 14 is
generated when xterm cannot open the /dev/tty. 

Any suggestions ? Is there anything I should know about compiling fvwm
on solaris ? I'm not on the mailing list so please send it to
thuan@jkoss.com.

Any suggestions at all are appreciated,
Thuan

Here is my new Fvwm.py for writing Fvwm modules in Python.  It was
inspired by Jonathan Kelley's fvwmmod.py for Fvwm version 1.  I
haven't done a lot with it, so I'd really appreciate feedback.

Find out more, and get my Snap.py sample module, by checking out this
URL:

    <http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/pyware/>

Note that these pages use frames and I *think* it should support
non-frame browsers, but if that doesn't work, I'd like to know that
too!

Enjoy,
-Barry

I suspect it doesn't.  Wish I knew enough about X to debug it.  For

Sounds like that would be very cool.  I'd like more control over what

Thanks for the suggestions.  Consensus was that XView apps don't 
behave well with other X apps.  A workaround is to use xcb to buffer 
the cut&paste operation, and it did the trick for me!

I see, now.
It would be better to suggest using "none" instead of "0x0"
or "nil" in FvwmPagerSmallFont, because 0x0 and nil don't work
with FvwmPagerFont.

  Would it be possible to add an extension to the WindowList module that 
highlights the appropriate window in the pager when the mouse is moved 
over the window name? I can't think of how better to explain that, so if 
somebody would like to help me out, please do.

Thanks!

I know that people have been mentioning implementing the gnu configure
script for fvwm2.  Is there a time-table on when this might be
implemented?

Thanks

Hi folks

I started using Andrew Veliath's title-bar patch fvwm-2.0.43.tbp4.diff,
and it's fun! I like using something like:

  TitleStyle ActiveUp (Solid <backcolor>)

But I also wanted to change the foreground colour, so here's a patch
to do that. Now you say:

  TitleStyle ActiveUp (Solid <forecolor>/<backcolor>)

You need to start with a new fvwm-2.0.43, apply fvwm-2.0.43.tbp4.diff
to the whole distribution, then apply the patch below in the fvwm-2.0.43
directory. 

Cheers
Ric

I've released a new version of FvwmIconMan (0.7). You can find it on
mahler.cs.arizona.edu in /pub/FvwmIconMan. I'd be grateful if as many
people as possible would download it and try it out. Since fvwm 2.1 is 
probably going to happen soon, I'm impatient to establish its stability. 

What's new:

1. Added two options (title, and iconname) so that you can set the
   title and icon name of the manager windows.
2. replaced the showtitle option with the format option. This lets you
   give a printf-like format string to describe the string to be
   displayed in a window's button. For example, the string "%c: %i"
   would print the classname of the window, followed by a colon and the
   icon name.
3. You can now use FvwmIconMan as a transient module, like FvwmWinList. 
4. I added a little chart near the front of the manpage listing the 
   options. I hate paging through manpages trying to figure out what all
   the options are, and I assume others do too.

I've released a new version of FvwmIconMan (0.7). You can find it on
mahler.cs.arizona.edu in /pub/FvwmIconMan. I'd be grateful if as many
people as possible would download it and try it out. Since fvwm 2.1 is 
probably going to happen soon, I'm impatient to establish its stability. 

What's new:

1. Added two options (title, and iconname) so that you can set the
   title and icon name of the manager windows.
2. replaced the showtitle option with the format option. This lets you
   give a printf-like format string to describe the string to be
   displayed in a window's button. For example, the string "%c: %i"
   would print the classname of the window, followed by a colon and the
   icon name.
3. You can now use FvwmIconMan as a transient module, like FvwmWinList. 
4. I added a little chart near the front of the manpage listing the 
   options. I hate paging through manpages trying to figure out what all
   the options are, and I assume others do too.

Before installing fvwm-2, I read in the FAQ that `warp' is 
not compatible with the new syntax.  I use:

   Key KP_Multiply A N Warp "whatever" emacs

 to define a key to warp to my emacs window.
I won't be ablt to do this anymore?  Is there an alternate syntax
to get the same effect?

I don't want to install the new version if things like this will
break.

Thanks!

Hello:
  I am a novice at building fvwm and X in general; so please excuse any
  question that might seem trival or can be answered with "RTFM". :-)

  When I am building fvwm, I am asked to enter the command 
               "xmkmf;;make Makefiles"
  I have access to imake, but what is xmkmf? How can I get it? Can
  I use imake instead? The command ./MakeMakefile also uses xmkmf. So
  I am stumped. (I have modified the configuration files correctly,
  I hope. :-)

  I would really like to try using the new version. So any help
  you can give would be appreciated. I am trying to build on an
  HPUX 9.x system.

xmkmf is an imake command.
You should check to see that your OPENWINHOME environment variable is set 
to /usr/openwin.
I'm no expert, but this is what I had to do.
Also, if possible, type: make Makefiles 
instead of using the MakeMakefile script.

how about giving a function name as an argument to FvwmWinlist.
This Function would then be called with the selected window.

One could then use FvwmWinList as a generic Selection mechanism for any
kind of operation (focus as well as close, kill, ...)

try this:

this provides time to the FvwmButton module to unswallow the windows,

You know, that's a really neat idea.  Kind of makes me wish that I'd

Hi,

I was wondering if a small change to the placement algorithm for
new windows might be worth considering.
I use an IconBox which runs across the top of my screen; the auto-
placement for new windows almost invariably puts the new window at
0,0 which is slap on top of the icons.
Perhaps we could have an option to exclude the iconBox from the 
window auto-placement area?

Regards,
James.

I've been playing with swallowing pager but every command I try I get
distortions. This is the closest I have come:
*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow (UseOld) "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 0")

What other ways are people doing this?

First off, I think that this discussion has migrated from talking about
the builtin WindowList, to the module FvwmWinList. They are two
different things.  If people confuse them, it causes confusion to
spread. If I'm confused, then hopefully my confusion will be contained
here.

Before hacking on FvwmWinList for all of this, I'd like to suggest that
interested people check out the latest release of FvwmIconMan
(ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan-0.7.tar.gz, and
in the next fvwm2 release whenever that happens) I've added the ability
to run transiently with this in mind. If you like it, cool. If you
don't, then you've made your job slightly easier by trying and
discarding one possible way to do things (I also wouldn't mind
constructive criticism).

Just so people know, I don't have anything against FvwmWinList. While
similar, the two programs are very different, and while I like the
differences in FvwmIconMan's favor, others may (and surely will) not. If
niftiness gets added to FvwmWinList, then you can be sure I'll be
watching with curiosity how it gets done, and will freely admit to
copying it. But, in this case, I think that you might look towards what
I've been doing. Making a program more configurable is always a slippery
slope, since once you open the door to new features, it sparks ideas for
ways to make them more general, logical, powerful, etc. FvwmWinList will
be no different, and since I've been sliding down that slope for some
time, it would make sense to check out any mistakes I've made. For
example, when adding the ability to bind arbitrary functions to the
selection of a window in FvwmWinList, the logical next step is to want
to be able to bind various functions to various types of events, and
then you may want functions that modify the state of the window list,
and then keeping control over the syntax starts taking some mental
effort.

I think that adding a functional parameter to WindowList makes good
sense though, but I think that extending it much further would lead to
the duplication of work in two other modules, and would violate the
basic priciple of modularity in fvwm.

Here's how I see the world of window lists in fvwm:

WindowList: small, guaranteed to work, lightweight, requires minimal
            amount of thought from Chuck Hines. 
FvwmWinList: more heavyweight. Mainly useful as a transient module.
FvwmIconMan: highly configurable. No point in using it if you're just 
             going to configure it to act like WindowList of
             FvwmWinList. Until now only usable as a long running
             module, but now can run transiently. On my machine at
             least, it seems to start up faster than FvwmWinList, but
             I wouldn't expect that to be universal.

Good thing for beta releases. There were some bad bugs in 0.7, so now you
there's a 0.7b:
ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan-0.7b.tar.gz

The bugs were: on solaris, it would dump core, and it didn't like you
doing "*FvwmIconMan*format" at all.

I have configured the FvwmAudio module in my .fvwm2rc95 file as per
instructions.  I have also tested the sounds I want to play 
independantly outside of the FvwmAudio module.  However, the FvwmAudio
module is not working and I do not know where to start to try and fix
it.  I have also searched the FAQ and fvwm-archive for all references
to FvwmAudio for similar problems.  It seems possible that FvwmAudio
may not be ready for general use yet?

I am running Linux 2.0.12, fvwm2-95, and use a SB16.  Below is the
relevant portion of hy .fvwm2rc95 file:

I seem to have a few problems with FVWM2.0

First of all, I can't see any Icons at all.  I've got the libXpm, so I 
can't figure out why they aren't showing.

Also, on FVWMButtons, I assign a program to a button (Using EXEC) and click 
the button but nothing happens.  I manually execute the program on an xterm 
and it executes fine

Sorry, I can't really help you out, but I just wanted to say, this is
not true.  I've been using FvwmAudio successfully on my sparc and
linux machines since the beginning of FvwmAudio.

This looks very similar to my setup, except that I don't have an entry
for FvwmAudioAudio.  (Try taking that out?  auplay should already know
where to send the audio.)  It works fine.  Is FvwmAudio actually
running?  There should be an FvwmAudio process running on your
machine.

Great!  that just means I'm not wasting my time.  I just have a setup
problem somewhere.

This could be the problem.  FvwmAudio is not running.  I have just
tried to get it started manually (both from the fvwm popup menu, and
from an xterm prompt).  It said I must be fvwm to start it.  I wonder
if since the process is called fvwm2-95, it is testing for the wrong
name?  Hmm.. looks like a little hacking is in order.

My problem was in the fvwm2-95.  When I started up under
fvwm2 (with similar configuration) the sound worked.

I guess this becomes more of a problem for the fvwm2-95 folks?

Make sure that your pixmappath matches where you are storing you
xpms. If you want to overrride the xpm, I find its helpful to use the
complete path.

Does it work if you use a module? How about if you exec an xterm? It
might have something to do with environment.

Hope this helps

Hi, I am a new fvwm user.  I believe that I am using
fvwm 1.2 (The one that came with the SlackWare 3.0 
distribution. I am initiating a remote connection to a
VAX with DECwindows Motif installed. When I run the remote
applications, they come up and function just fine but
when I minimize them, fvwm is unable to detect their
internal icons and puts its default question mark up
instead for all the remote DEC apps except "DECterm" and 
"Message  Window". The reason that I suspect that this is
a proplem with fvwm is because when I run olvwm. all the 
icons appear properly with their proper size. Any help 
would be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance if 
this has been answered many times before.

My xterms frequently change the string that is displayed
in the icon.  I've noticed that fvwm-2.0.43 does not
resize the icon to take the new name into account.

Hmm. Now that I think about that its not completely true. If
the mouse moves over the icon then the whole name is displayed.
But when the mouse is moved away from the icon the original
(truncated) name comes back.  Finally if I restart fvwm the
icons end up with the correct info.

If there is some config parameter that can change this please
let me know.

Also if possible, please CC me since I am not on this mailing list.

In fact you can, just not with an option in .fvwm2rc. I wanted this
behaviour too, so changed the code a little bit. The three lines appeared
only when a window was NOT sticky. It's pretty easy to change, just look a
little bit around in some .c files. Or even better, get the
pixmap-in-the-titlebar patch. That's the one I use at the moment, much
nicer! :)

Are you referring to Jarl's TitleDown patch?  His page (and patch) is

I recently upgraded to fvwm2.0.43 from fvwm2.0.42,
and I'm having trouble getting the same behavior with
the FvwmIconMan module as I had before.

I want to have mouse button 1, when clicked on
an entry in the FvwmIconMan table, deiconify the window
if necessary, switch focus to
the selected window, and warp the cursor to that window.

In fvwm2.0.42, with a patch to the focus code,
I could do this via the following line in my .fvwm2rc file:

	*FvwmIconMan*action      click1 Iconify -1, Focus 1

Is there a way to get this same behavior in fvwm2.0.43?

Is a patch needed?

Thanks,

If you use pixmaps for icons, the icon title will always be the same
width as the pixmap. If you use no pixmaps (i.e. something like
Style "xterm" Icon none.xpm) then you can fix the problem with
the following patch. Chuck said this will be included in the next release.

Apply the patch in the fvwm-2.0.43/ directory.

Usually, X11 distributions have this xmkmf which is just a shell
script.  Maybe your X11 distribution is broken and doesn't have it.  I
include the one from Sun Solaris 2.5 OpenWindows below and you could
just adapt it to your machine (path settings and suchlike).

Hello,

Could someone please give me a hint how I can move a window into the
upper right corner of the screen? I tried "move -0p 0p" and similar
combinations but none of them worked. I would like to have such a
feature in the upper frame of windows realized as a button (the button
for moving to the upper left corner already works: move 0p 0p). Thank
you very much in advance.

Read the ChangeLog and you'll see that the Focus behavior has changed
to no longer warp the cursor (coincidentally, it was at the request of
FvwmIconMan's author, among many other people) and that was part of
what his patch covered.

Basically, you should be able to get the same behavior by calling a
function instead of the builtin Focus, which could be defined like so:

AddToFunc FocusAndWarp "I" Iconify -1
+                      "I" Focus
+                      "I" WarpToWindow 2p 2p

This patch partly corrects the problem. When I start X up my .xinitrc
file starts a bunch of xterms iconified, and after a few seconds the
shell issues some escape sequence that changes the icon name... So in
this case the icon name for the initially display icon is truncated. If
I open the window and then re-inconify all is well.

In any case thanks for the quick response.

Thanks! This does exactly what I want.
Now I have a new problem:

With fvwm2.0.42 (with focus patch),
I had the following line in my .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmIconMan*action      select Focus 0

This allowed sweeping the mouse down the FvwmIconMan table,
and input focus would be given to the selected window,
without changing the current viewport or raising the window.

With fvwm2.0.43, I tried the following:

*FvwmIconMan*action      Select    sendcommand select select Focus

Unfortunately, if the window is not iconified,
this causes the selected window to be raised,
and the viewport is warped to that of the selected window. 
This is very disconcerting and not at all what I want.

Is there a way to get the old behavior in fvwm2.0.43?
Is a patch needed? 

Brady Montz suggested changing
builtins.c to delete lines 204 (RaiseWindow) and
perhaps line 205 (KeepOnTop).  This fixes the problem
with the window getting raised, but I still get the
warping to the viewport that contains the window.

What can I do to eliminate the warping to another viewport?

Thanks,

Yes, this is a timing problem. Originally fvwm only calculated the
icon width when the icon was created. This was why doing a Restart
fixed the icon width. My patch causes it to be recalculated on every
Iconify (if there is no icon pixmap). The problem here is that
the window is created and the initial iconify happens before the shell
starts and issues its comands to change the icon name. 

Now, perhaps someone out there with better knowledge of X than me will
tell me if I'm wrong, but there is no way for fvwm to be informed of
a change in the icon name. It must make explicit calls to XGetWMIconName().

Hmm, could one write a module (FvwmDaemon) that sat and polled 
windows for a set of properties, and issued fvwm commands based upon
the results? What would the overhead be? Is it a silly late-night idea? :-)

Anyway, Ram, perhaps you could get around your problem by putting a delay
in your .xinitrc, a bit like this:

xterm -iconic &
xterm -iconic &
sleep 10         # enough time for the shells to start
fvwm             # now safe to start wm and iconify windows

How does FVWMWinList do it?  It reacts to changes in the icon name
instantly and doesn't seem to be polling.  Hmm, from the source it seems it
waits for ConfigureWindow packets.  It's been a while since I was in that
code so I'm not really up to following it further.

When I restart fvwm I get

[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of ' fvwm2' failed!!!!

I bet that the 2 spaces between Restart and fvwm2 are the cause of the

Restart so that it ignores any leading spaces?

Well, duh! Repeat after me, Ric: "I will not try to think about difficult
X things while half-asleep". :-)

OK, I wasn't thinking. *Obviously* fvwm is informed of the icon_name change
since it redraws the name string in the icon. It just doesn't do a redraw
of the whole icon window.

So, here's what happens. Fvwm get a PropertyNotify event with value
XA_WM_ICON_NAME, and HandlePropertyNotify() calls RedoIconName().
It also does a BroadcastName() so that modules know about it, too. 

RedoIconName() just does a redraw of the icon_name string in the icon
window. So, here's a patch to it that does a whole new Iconify() for
icons with no pixmap. (Can someone smart please check my call to
Iconify() isn't bogus). Note: if the icon name gets wider and the icon
window no longer fits in the icon box without overlap, the icon will move
to a new location. I find this OK ... do other people find this desirable? 

Anyway, Ram, try this (in addition to my other patch) and see if it fixes
your problem.

Hallo!


WRT Fvwm:

 - Is there a way to specify that my FvwmButtons window *never* has the
   focus, not even when I click on it?

 - How can I tell a window to StayOnBottom?

 - May I ask to Fvwm to fill an IconBox in right-to-left order?


WRT FvwmButtons:

 - Is it possible to use both Swallow and Action in a button?
   I'd like to swallow oclock, and have an "xclock -digital" called when
   I click on the oclock button.

 - Is there a way to use a regexp in a "hangon" name? My VIM opens with
   the filename in the titlebar, and I would use "VIM*", as in the Style
   command.


All The Best,
 Marco

Exactly what clocks can FVWM2's FvwmButtons module swallow? So far I've 
only be able to get xclock to be swallowed, but I would much rather have 
it swallow dclock (digital clock). My problem might actually be related 
to dclock itself, since my version of dclock doesn't support editres, but 
I'd like to get something like it for my button bar.

Hello,

Could someone please give me a hint how I can move a window into the
upper right corner of the screen? I tried "move -0p 0p" and similar
combinations but none of them worked. I would like to have such a
feature in the upper frame of windows realized as a button (the button
for moving to the upper left corner already works: move 0p 0p).
Thankyou very much in advance.

I've got my FvwmButton's swallowing xdalicclock, a digital clock with neat
morphing effects. I use this line to do it:

*FvwmButtons(3x1)       - -     Swallow "xdaliclock" Exec xdaliclock -noseconds -bg grey -fg darkviolet

Justin, I've been "swallowing" dclock for a long time now.  Here's
the line in my .fvwm2rc file to do it:

*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "dclock" Exec dclock -fn -*-helvetica-bold-r-*-* -14-* -noscroll -date "%M %d" -seconds -bw 0 -noalarm -bg seashell3 -fg DarkSlat eGray &

You can probably shorten that quite a bit and still have it work.
I screw around with fonts because I don't see too well and need
bold lettering everywhere I can get it.  :-\

or should that be 	8-\   		?
since I _do_ wear glasses  ;-)

I've been using xdaliclock for some time, but have a slight problem where if
I restart fvwm, causing xdaliclock to be killed and restarted, sometimes
it won't restart, and I'll have to manually start one. It spits out this
error:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  63 (X_CopyPlane)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2000007
  Serial number of failed request:  8066
  Current serial number in output stream:  8084

I know that I should just figure out the FvwmButtons command that causes a
swallowed program to be regurgitated and reswallowed during a restart, but 
it doens't happen often enough to cause me to be motivated. I'm just
curious if anyone else has seen this.

You can't really do this right now, unfortunately.  But I do think

I haven't seen the error, but then I don't pay much attention to that
logfile. However, about one time out of 20, xdaliclock won't start when I
start fvwm. It's probably the same problem you're having..

Can't yet, although it's on the TO-DO list.

If you want you can put a snippet of code in your local FvwmButtons to
achieve this.  Something like the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    {
      XWMHints hints;
      Atom at;

      hints.flags = InputHint;
      hints.input = False;

      XSetWMHints(XtDisplay(topLevel), XtWindow(topLevel), &hints);
      at = XInternAtom(XtDisplay(topLevel),"WM_TAKE_FOCUS",False);
      XDeleteProperty(XtDisplay(topLevel),XtWindow(topLevel),at);
    }
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this would have to be modified slightly to actually work in
FvwmButtons.  I use this in 'xlbiff' so it never steals my focus when
it pops up.  Just make sure you aren't using 'Lenience'.

Marco>  - How can I tell a window to StayOnBottom?

Can't yet, although it's on the TO-DO list too.

Marco>  - May I ask to Fvwm to fill an IconBox in right-to-left order?

This SHOULD have been on the TO-DO list, but I forgot to put it
there.  It's there now though.

Marco> WRT FvwmButtons:

Marco>  - Is it possible to use both Swallow and Action in a button?
Marco>    I'd like to swallow oclock, and have an "xclock -digital" called when
Marco>    I click on the oclock button.

I believe once an app is swallowed, all button events get directed to
it, so you can't do this right now.  Probably should make this
possible in the future.

Marco>  - Is there a way to use a regexp in a "hangon" name? My VIM opens with
Marco>    the filename in the titlebar, and I would use "VIM*", as in the Style

Nope, not currently.  Use the Class or Resource name instead.

This isn't entirely true (sorry, Chuck).

Yes, once an app is swallowed all events do get directed to it, but this
isn't true of the label.  Presently I use the following FvwmButtons
configuration:

*FvwmButtons(1x4	\
	Title		'System Info' \
	Swallow		"xload"	'Exec xload' \
	Action(Mouse 1)	'Exec xosview -cua0 -net 200 -ul -l -geometry 325x325' \
	Action(Mouse 2) 'Exec xcpustate -interval 1 -bg "#a4978e" -fg black' \
	Action(Mouse 3)	'Exec rxvt -fg "khaki" -bg "dark olive green" \
		-fat -n top -T Top -7 -e top' )

This lets me start three different applications by left/middle/right
clicking on the label.  I do wish I could have this functionality
without havning to set a Title, but hey. . . at least this works.

I've been toying with this idea for a new module for some time, and was
wondering about other people's thoughts on it. 

Here's the background. I have two buttons on my titlebars, one of which
maximizes the window horizontally, and the other vertically. It's annoying
that if I resize first horizonally, and then vertically, I don't get what you
would naively expect, but it's understandable, since fvwm doesn't maintain a
stack of state information for windows.

I once sat down and thought about other cases where one might want state
associated with a window, but have since forgotten what I came up with. Two
things that come to my mind are stack order manipulation, and window groups.

The proposed module would keep all sorts of user definable state about
windows, and upon receiving commands (SendToModule - yippie!) could do
various things. 

Does anyone else thing that this might turn into something useful?

Hmmm.  You could achieve some of that functionality by letting functions
keep state somehow.  You'd need to allow variables and probably decision
constructs to make use of them.

Nah, too complicated.  If you want a real language, why not use a real
language?  Would Barry's FvwmPython module work for this kind of thing?

Chuck, here's another tweak for the fvwm2 manpage.

FvwmForm seems to ignore colors.  I tried both lines of the form 
"*QuitVerifyBack blue" and "*QuitVerifyBack #0000ff" and neither 
work.  Ditto for the foreground color and item colors.  I use 
the line "Module FvwmForm QuitVerify" to launch it.  I'm using
fvwm-2.0.43 and X11R6-3.1.2E.  Any suggestions?

Also, is there a way to get fvwm2 to re-read the .fvwm2rc file
without restarting?  Any changes I make to FvwmForm lines don't
take effect until after a restart.  It's annoying to have to
restart just to look at a new layout.

Are you running X at >256 colors? When I run at 256 colors, it displays
stuff in color. At 16bpp, it displays all in black and white.

Yes, I am running more than 256 colors.  After all, that's the only way I can 
display my big, beautiful, 256 color .gif of Babylon 5 in the root window and 
still have enough colormap entries for everything else. :)

Does the author of FvwmForm read this list?  I assume this bug report will get 
back to him one way or another...

I don't know Python, but would like to do some nice function.

Is there a project for FvwmPerl?

I wrote some code for doing modules in Perl which Chuck Hines says he'll
include in the extras/ directory of the next release.

It's most useful with Perl 5 and the Tk extensions, but will still work
with Perl 4 (e.g. FvwmDebug can be written in Perl 4 with no
extensions).

The big demo is a TkPerl module which combines the functionality of
FvwmDebug and FvwmTalk (plus, unlike FvwmTalk and its cousin implemented
through FvwmForm, this one allows cut and paste to and from the command
line).

Anyone interested in a sneak preview can contact me by email; I'm eager
to get some feedback on it.

Thanks,

Wow.  I can filter out many requests mistakenly sent to the list, but I
can't filter them out if they keep misspelling them!  Just where is it that
people get the idea that hey can send requests to the same address that
they would send mail to the list?  (Don't answer that; I'd probably be
depressed to find the answer.)

I just noticed what appears to be a small bug in the menus.  When the menu 
title + icon is the longest line in the menu, the title is not displayed 
correctly.  The icon covers the first part of it.  Can anyone confirm this?

This is funny.  I just had the exact same problem with FvwmCpp tonight.  
Solution:  invoke fvwm as "fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 ...'".  "What? I don't see any 
mention of '-cmd' in the fvwm2 man page.", you say?  That's because it's not 
there.  I found it by looking through the source code.  Apparently, fvwm is 
trying to interpret the binary of FvwmM4 as an fvwm2rc file.

I agree.

well, all MOUSE button events are passed to that app. anyways.
but if the app has wminputhints=off, it doesn't accept KEYBOARD events,
so a keypress is handled by FvwmButtons.

thus sth like
 *FvwmButtons(1x4	\
 	Swallow		"xload"	'Exec xload' \
 	Action		'Exec xosview -cua0 -net 200 -ul -l -geometry 325x325')

starts xosview, if you position the mouse on the xload and press enter,
without the need for the title.

well' it's not pretty, but I use it to have my emacs read my mail from xbiff.

If wminputhints=off also rejected MOUSE events, then your above example
would also work without need for the title.

That's right, and I admitted that I forgot to update the man page when
I announced that 2.0.43 was ready and included the patch for it in the
announcement, have the same patch for the man page on the 'Latest
News' section of the official home page, and if all else fails the
ChangeLog does explicitly mention this change...

I'm having problems running "the GIMP" under FVWM because of
the changing colormap between windows. I'm hoping someone has
a suggestion.

"the GIMP" is a "General Image Manipulation Program". It has a
initial user-interface window that takes up just a few colors
(some grays, black, white).  The main image window kicked off
by this user-interface though, has unlimited colors allocated
based on the image (gif/jpeg) image you're looking at.

Unfortnately the two colormaps are now the same ??????????
So when my mouse is in the image window and I popup a menu
from the user-interface, I can't even read it because its colormap
is different.

Does anybody run "the GIMP" successfully ?

Is there anyway to associate colormaps between two different 
windows associated with the same application ?

Things seem to run much better under TWM (as a test case).

Hi,

I'm trying to put the window list into my Button bar without much
success.
Is it possible? If so a hint would be nice.

Can anyone help me with this please.

Cheers Murray

I had the same problem.  Do you have netscape running?  Or any other apps that
could take many colors?  Seems that when an app is taking to much color from
the color map, FvwmForm don't display them anymore.  As soon as I closed my
netscape window FvwmForm worked fine.

Does anybody know the reason?  A fix?  Meanwhile, I live with it...

Python is a free, object-oriented scripting language.  Personally, I
prefer it to Tcl or Perl since it scales up much better as projects
grow.  Because of it's huge library, it's also perfect for small
scripts.  Anyway, to find out more about Python, including grabbing
everything you need to play with it and learn more, check out

Resize and Maximize are particularily bad at remembering old states,
yes.

Both potentially quite useful.

I had thought about adding this kind of stuff at some point, which I

Which is why it's still on the TO-DO list...

BAW> Funny, I was thinking the same thing! :-)

BAW> <http://www.python.org/~bwarsaw/pyware/>

Or Perl:

And it is.

Barry - would you like me to include your FvwmPython stuff in the
extras directory as well?

Brady> Does anyone else thing that this might turn into something

I think the idea is good no matter how it's implemented.  I imagine
that using the Python or Perl interfaces would be simplest though.

I don't know if the original author of FvwmForm is around any more or
not, but another user did contribute a patch to fix this problem to
me, and it'll be in 2.1.0 (soon).

I've included the patch to FvwmForm.c below if you'd like to try it
now (no lines, no waiting).

Python is the much more natural choice in my opinion for this sort of thing.
I was so happy when I discovered python after struggling with perl for two
years. 

I've been reading though the FvwmPython stuff, and it seems like a good place
to start. I was thinking though that given python's capabilities, it might be
logical to turn the FvwmPython code (can't really call it a module I guess),
into a sort of Python module server, so you could have multiple python modules
runnning, with FvwmPython controlling all of them. 

Also (this might not go over too well I imagine), python's ability to be
embedded into a C program offers interesting possibilities. Last year there
was some discussion on this list about whether it would be beneficial to
replace the current message passing implementation of modules with dynamic
loading of module code into the running fvwm process. I think it's still on
the todo list as well. This might be a clean way to do that.

I think you've been reading my mind!  I'm glad my module [*] has
sparked these discussions because my free time is probably too limited
to explore a lot of these myself.  Hopefully my module will provide a
good jumping off point...

On your first note, I'd thought about that in some detail, but haven't
put the fingers to the keyboard yet.  I was thinking it would be
pretty cool to have a framework similar to Grail's where a naming
convention for SendToModule strings could trigger this long lived
FvwmPython module to import bits as needed, and could cache state,
etc.  But then this led me (as it led you) to thinking about embedding
the interpreter in FVWM directly, a la Lele Gaifax's PyApache for
embedding Python into the Apache HTTP server (see
<http://www.python.org/python/Contributed.html>).  The cool thing is
that this would almost instantly make FVWM ILU-aware and then you
could talk to FVWM through ILU interfaces.  There's probably a lot of
cool things you could do here if you described the interface to FVWM
via ILU.

Well, food for thought anyway.  I'm going to try to play with some of
these ideas when possible, but I encourage others to as well!  And
please, I'd love to have feedback on Fvwm.py!

-Barry

[*] is it a Python-FVWM module, an FVWM-Python module, an FVWM module
Python module, or a Python module FVWM module??? :-)

Hi all!

If you use FvwmCpp on the whole .fvwm2rc, how do you protect yourself
against errors like the following:

.fvwm2rc:19: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:23: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:29: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:35: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:37: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:44: invalid preprocessing directive name
.fvwm2rc:47: unterminated character constant
.fvwm2rc:77: parse error
.fvwm2rc:85: unterminated string or character constant
.fvwm2rc:229: unterminated string or character constant
.fvwm2rc:77: unterminated `#if' conditional


The first ones are due to the '##' which I use sometimes and is mistaken
for a preprocessor directive (it is triggered by '#*' also), and the
others are quite common if you write a ' in a comment or '#if' or things
like that.

At the moment, I use the following:

----- /var/X11R6/lib/xinit/xinitrc:

[...]

/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2/precpp.pl <~/.fvwm2rc >~/.fvwm2rc.cpp
fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp -Cppprog /usr/bin/cpp $HOME/.fvwm2rc.cpp"

----- /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm2/precpp.pl:

#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<>) {
   (! /^ *#/ || /^ *# *(include|define|if|endif|ifdef|undef|else|elif|
                 line|error|pragma)/) && print $_;
}


It works, but does not protect against the '# if' at line 77.

If you use '#if' without any space in your preprocessed files, you
can change the "/^ *# *(" with "/^ *#(".

As soon as I find the time, I could implement this thing into FvwmCpp, if
you think it is of any use.

Of course, FvwmCpp is the result of a random mutation, so I can't contact
the author via e-mail.


All The Best,
 Marco

I too have a lack of free time at the moment. I'll have to look at the more
interesting parts of python, since until now I've mainly be using it as a
scripting language.

  I suppose the cynical (and possibly unhelpful) answer is to use
FvwmM4 instead. m4 is not very difficult to pick up since cpp is based
on m4. Just make sure to use -m4-prefix to avoid problems with
`include'.

While I agree on the use of m4 (I use it heavily myself), beware that
-m4-prefix depends on an m4 that supports it, such as gnu m4.  Most
stock versions won't.  Since I run the same .fvwm2rc on a machine with
gnu m4 and on one without, I use the -m4-squote and -m4-equote options
to specify new quote characters (I need the default `'s for other
things in .fvwm2rc).  An alternative would be to put a changequote
directive at the top of .fvwm2rc.  I then quote anything that would be
processed by m4.  Note that this occasionally causes a surprise.  I
recently started using the latest FvwmIconMan and found that gnu m4
has a format directive...  I suppose one could quote the entire file,
except for those bits where one wants m4 processing, but that seems to
me to be more a hassle than it's worth.

I found another bug in menus. It really isn't serious, but here's the problem
anyway: Open a menu, move cursor over a submenu entry which isn't defined, move
cursor back to parent menu and you see the problem: submenus pop up in wrong 
place and can't be seen all the time. If parent menu is itself a submenu, the
problem disappers when you move cursor over its own parent. Otherwise you must
escape from menus or select something. 

Another thing is what to do with these menu entries which don't do anything. Should
they be shadowed or should they disappear? Anyway we shouldn't be able to select
something that does nothing. I would like to see something like global option 

DisabledShadowing <percentage>

where percentage defines transparency of dummy entries, and if it's zero we don't
even see them. They don't really disappear from internals and if we define this 
missing submenu or function, it can be seen again. I think this breaks or needs changes
to too many things now, but maybe later?

Still one thing: moving with cursor keys in menus sucks. We really shouldn't be
able to go anywhere on the screen with cursor keys and pressing right arrow on
a submenu should open that menu and move us there, not go 10 pixels right. I
tried to fix this one a couple of times, but I don't understand events and X...
this one should be easy if you know what to do. I don't ;(

Hmm, still one thing. I think triangles in menus indicating a submenu should 
go to left side, if we expand menu to the left, also
_________  ____________
|Dummy   ||<| Sub Dummy|
|        ||<| Other    |
|________||____________|
          |Kill Me     |
	  |____________|

Well that's really enough.

Hello Fvwm(95) users,

When I use fvwm 1.x or 2.x I can configure fvwm so that I only see the
sticky icons and the icons for the windows on a specific desktop. However,
the FvwmTaskBar module wants to show the active ans iconized windows of all
desktops. Is there a configuration setting to let the TaskBar just show the
windows related to the current desktop (and all sticky windows).

kind regards,

Kees de Bruin

I dont think the TaskBar does this.  But the latest FvwmWinList(blame
me) in Fvwm95 does what you are asking. Set the
FvwmWinListShowCurrentDesk option.  FvwmWinList also has the MiniTitle
Icons and Highlights according to Focused window, like TaskBar.

I would Summit it to Fvwm2 also, but there is no #define FVWM95  for
ifdefs to wrap around the MiniTitle Icon stuff.
Or is there ? Hector?

Hello Bruin,

In fact I too was looking for such an option in the FvwmTaskBar.  Since I 
did not see any such option and I wanted one, I hacked at the code.  As 
of now, I am the only person testing the new version of the TaskBar.  If 
you are interested in it, I can send the code to you.  But as of yet I 
have not done it for sticky windows, though it is just a very small code 
change.  Also, I would like to make this version available to everyone.

Regards,
Balaji

Hello,

I get an "Initialization error: Invalid geometry resource" message 
when I try to start up Xemacs 19.14 under fvwm. I have not found 
any man pages or guidance specific to set up of Xemacs resources
for fvwm. Could you give me some pointers for debugging this?

I am running fvwm version 1.24o on a sparc ultra 1, Solaris 2.5 
and Xemacs 19.14. The same Xemacs runs on the same platform and
OS but with a different Xdisplay server (olvwm) just fine.

Thanks for your response, 

I had just added Xemacs and found that I did not have a .Xdefaults in
my home dir when I started. I copied one in and did an:

		xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults

and then everything worked on the fvwm display. 

Cordially,
Greg.

Has anybody seen use of FvwmForm cause fvwm to crash?  I have an Ultra
140 running
SunOS oz 5.5.1 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1 and if I click cancel or
close this
causes fvwm to die.  The following is the stack trace of the SEGV that I
havn't had
time to chase as of yet.  If anyone has seen this I'd like to know if
I've done
a bad thing somewhere in the install, etc.

Thanks

Not all SunOS compiled objects will run under Solaris correctly.

Hm.  You seem to be missing a library from the final link list.  I
thought that it compiled just fine out of the box under normal Solaris
systems, so I wonder what's happening here. Anyone out there who
normally compiles under Solaris care to help Tuan?

Check for the -lsocket -lnsl at the end of your link commands. They have to be
there, if not my guess is you have a problem with your Imake setup.

Best luck!

Make sure you have -lnsl and -lsocket in the EXTRA_LIBRARIES

Regarding Tuan Le's compilation problem on Solaris...

My guess is he didn't build the Makefiles on the Solaris box (that is,
he used the Makefiles from the Sunos build).  That would explain the
missing `-lsocket -lnsl' from the link lines.  The rest of the link
lines should be identical, especially if he uses gcc, so all the .c's
would compile properly.  It does build "out of the box" for me on
Solaris, modulo an edit to Fvwm.tmpl I need to specify local paths.

I don't seem to get names at the bottom of my icons.  Does anyone
know how to turn this feature on...or what I broke?

Also, what's the setting to get my icons to be placed at the bottom
or side of the window...sort of like what MWM does.

Any help is appreciated.

Can anyone help with this minor niggle ?
I have 
Style "*"	Icon
in my .fvwmrc file, but for those apps I don't supply an icon for like

Style "TkMan"	    Icon TkMan.xpm

I get no icon, just a small box with the icon title.
Is it me ? or is it a bug

Didn't you answer your own question?
If you don't supply them an icon, they won't show one.
Maybe i'm misunderstanding you.

As far as I know, FVWM doesn't have that capability.

I am using Fvwm 1.24 on a Sparc with SunOS 4.1.3.  We have a new X application
 that runs on a server and displays on my machine.  If I run with Fvwm the app
 loads okay, some of the "buttons" on the app don't work (lock up windows).

But, if I exit out of windows and start Open Look window manager, then start the
 app.  Windows stops/crashes immediately, no error messages.

The third, twist to this is eXceed.  If I start Hummingbird eXceed on a pc,
 start the app on the server (displays on pc).  Now the app works fine, all
 buttons work correctly on the pc.


The app is really meant to be used with Solaris and TriTeal Vue.  But I have
 other software dependent on SunOs.  It sounds like some kind of X revision
 issue, if I made a guess (not knowing much about X).  The vendor supports the
 Solaris/TriTeal combination only, from what I can tell.

>From all this info, can anyone tell me what I need to do (hints, suggestios
 welcome) to make this app work with fvwm and olwm?  Since most of the
 discussions on this list were concerning Fvwm2, I'm not on the list anymore. 
 So, could you please send me an email to:
  kwerner@ictest.delcoelect.com


Thanks in advance,
Kevin

I agree!  I am tented to consider this as a fvwm's bug.  Many apps provide
their own icon, but when iconified using fvwm they never show.  

What I have in my fvwmrc file is the following

Style "*"  Icon unknown.xpm

At least every iconified apps get an icon.  But is surely not the one apps'
default one.  It is, like Ian said, a pain to have to define an Icon for every
apps I'll ever run.

Nevertheless, fvwm is great!  And the Icon are still better looking than in
straight Mwm!!  So that's why I'm not complaining to much...

My two cents..

stdarg.h is an include file -- on my linux box, it's one of the include 
files that came with gcc. You may need a gcc reinstall ...

Try varargs.h instead, this comes with your system and might work as a
plug-in replacement for stdarg.h.

TkMan.xpm must be in your PixmapPath for the Icon command to find it.
Is it?

I have several apps running right now that provide their own icons
(Netscape, for example).

This is why you don't see any builtin icons.  But judging from your

Ah - the real problem.  Perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea for me to
add some way to say "use this as the default icon unless the program
wants to provide one itself".  I'll have to investigate this.

Ummm. My fvwm set up _does_ do this. I use 

Style "*" Icon Monalisa.xpm

to setup my default icon. But when I iconify an application that I haven't
specified an icon for, the application's icon is used, unless it doesn't
provide one.

 I have ClickToFocus commented out of my .fvwmrc so
I am in focus-follows mouse mode, which is what I want.
However, I cannot figure out how to get fvwm to 
raise the window when I click on it, except by clicking
on the borders.  I want to be able to click anywhere
in a window to raise that window.  How do I do this?

It's not cynical, and it's helpful. I have Yet Another Language to learn,

The most difficult thing is using info (or emacs) to browse through the
info file. I hate those hyperthings.

Does the -m4-squote option works? I've not been able to use it, and the
example in the man page doesn't work.

stdin:11: m4: Warning: Excess arguments to built-in `m4_define' ignored
stdin:25: m4: Cannot open {/root/.fvwm2rc}: No such file or directory
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 changequote({,

shalott:~# m4 --version
GNU m4 1.4



Is there a way to refer to $HOME within FvwmM4 or Fvwm ?

I'd like to include(`~/.fvwm-whatever'), because I often launch X from a
directory that is not $HOME.

Hi all!

I am configuring my desktop (a very cute 1024x768x64k, with 32x32 icons on
menus, mail me if you'd like to receive an example) and I've mistakenly
run gnuplot as "Exec gnuplot", instead of through an xterm.

So, what happened?

Well, gnuplot prints some info on the console, and X just hangs.
I killed gnuplot with -9, it became a zombie, and fvwm was still frozen, with
the previous menu stuck on the screen.

The only way to recover the system is to kill X (killing fvwm doesn't work).

Is it possible to avoid such hangups? Of course it has been my fault, but I
had other things running.

Is this caused by fvwm (2.0.43), X (XFree 3.1.2E), or the kernel
(linux 2.0.14)?

This is the loop I can see with "strace gnuplot":

ioctl(0, TCSETSW, {B38400 opost isig -icanon -echo ...}) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGTTOU (Stopped (tty output)) ---
ioctl(0, TCSETSW, {B38400 opost isig -icanon -echo ...}) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGTTOU (Stopped (tty output)) ---
ioctl(0, TCSETSW, {B38400 opost isig -icanon -echo ...}) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)

The attached files are a patch to FvwmBanner and, just in case of an
inclusion in the fvwm package, to the manpage.

When I start up X, I like having a picture on the center of the background
(the silly linux penguin) for ten seconds. Unfortunately, I thought, if I
happen to click on the image, it disappears. My patch prevents it, by
introducing the option "*FvwmBannerMouse Ignore".

While I was at it, I also added FvwmBannerX and FvwmBannerY.

Now my question is: is there a way to pass the ButtonRelease to fvwm so that
it will display the root menu over the image?

GNU m4:

File: m4.info,  Node: Esyscmd,  Next: Sysval,  Prev: Syscmd,  Up: UNIX c=
ommands

Reading the output of commands
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

   If you want `m4' to read the output of a UNIX command, use `esyscmd':

     esyscmd(SHELL-COMMAND)

which expands to the standard output of the shell command SHELL-COMMAND.

   Prior to executing the command, `m4' flushes its output buffers.
The default standard input and error output of SHELL-COMMAND are the
same as those of `m4'.  The error output of SHELL-COMMAND is not a part
of the expansion: it will appear along with the error output of `m4'.

   Assume you are positioned into the `checks' directory of GNU `m4'
distribution, then:

     define(`vice', `esyscmd(grep Vice ../COPYING)')
     =3D>
     vice
     =3D>  Ty Coon, President of Vice
     =3D>

   Note how the expansion of `esyscmd' has a trailing newline.

   The builtin macro `esyscmd' is recognized only when given arguments.

I am running fvwm95 v 2.042a (previously I run fvwm 2.0.42 which had
same fault) under Solaris 2.5 and I have a litle problem with
resizing windows. When I try to resize a window by grabbing one of the
corners the wondow suddenly gets verically enlarged. It gets around
4-5 screens high.

The strange behaviour seems more frequent for Motif and Athena 
applications than for Xview application.

Has anyone else had such problem ?
Does anybody know how to go around the problem (it's irritating)?

Normally I ignore fvwm95 questions on this list, but since this was a
problem in fvwm itself, I'll tell you that was a known problem and it
was fixed in fvwm 2.0.43.

Be shadowed, unless there is a real need to hide. But this is a
look-and-feel issue, FVWM should give both behaviours.
The problem comes with menu icons: should FVWM provide a facility
to create shadow icons (and how?), or simply use an alternate file
(quite a pain for the user), or both, or none?

I'd like to see color menu items, or at least menu titles.

Why not make triangles configurable or pixmappable (altough I like them)?

humm... There are a lot of things to do on the menu entries (just take
a look at the last version of AfterStep if you want some ideas).
I think a good solution would be to wait until 2.1.0 and write the
menu as a module. Then we could add all the things we want (almost :))
without bloating the main fvwm code.

Since I don't really know the fvwm code, I'm not sure if this is
possible or totally stupid ;).

  I don't know. I haven't tried this. As someone has already pointed
out, the man page example needs to use `fvwm -cmd' not `fvwm -f'.

  The FvwmM4 manpage shows `HOME' as a pre-defined symbol in the
EXAMPLE PROLOG, but does not mention it in the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
section. I just tested which section is correct. It turns out `HOME'
is pre-defined.

  You could use

    m4_include(HOME`/.fvwm-whatever')

I have the following:

Style "*"           DumbPlacement

in my .fvwm2rc (and I'm using 2.43).

The current dumb placement is to place somewhere near +10+10 relative to where
the window was moved to last.  I would like this to be +0+0, i.e. no change
from the position the last time the window was placed.

Is this possible?

Also, I saw an entry for ActivePlacement in the fvwm2 man page, but did not see 
a description of it.  Can someone please explain it to me?

Thanks,
David Wuertele

Hello, all.

I have Fvwm 2.0.43 and am having some trouble with the FvwmButtons
module; namely, that I can't get it to work.  I have tried everything
that I know to try, including:

	  I.  upgrading from 2.0.42, where the trouble first arose.
	 II.  copying FvwmButtons from a system that works just fine.
	III.  copying a .fvwm2rc from that same system.
	 IV.  making use of the FvwmButtonsFile command and confining all my
configuration info to that file.
	  V.  countless configurations and geometry (both size and location)
specifications. 
	 
Here are the symptoms:
	
	  I.  FvwmButtons will not load on Startup or Restart.
	 II.  It will not load when called from a popup menu.
	III.  It will not load when called from FvwmTalk.

Curiously enough, when I try to invoke it from the command line, I get
the normal "Must be started by Fvwm" message.  Furthermore, when I
specify: `Style "FvwmButtons" 	WindowListHit` I can see that it is at no
time actually running, as opposed to running somewhere but being
obscured due to some config stuff (at least I think).

In case it is XF86Config specific, I am running 640x480 mode and
virtual, XF86_SVGA server.  And, in case of hardware specifics, it is a
laptop monitor, if that helps.  System specifics:  RedHat 3.0.4.

That's all I know to tell, other than that the Fvwm1.xx GoodStuff worked
fine.  If there is something I have left out, be it more information, or
something simple I can try, I would be happy to offer more info or take
suggestions (please).  

Thanks in advance.

what does the error log of fvwm say?
how do you invoke FvwmButtons?
try a minimal config.

Perhaps you're running into the same problem I ran into (very, very
frustrating), which is that FvwmButtons doesn't work with version
3.4h of the Xpm library.  I can't remember what the error is, but I
do remember that the bugger just wouldn't run, no matter what you
try.  It would, however, launch any swallowed applications before
croaking.

I re-linked FvwmButtons with version 3.4a of libXpm, which I happened
to have lying around at the time, and it works great.

I'm running on a SUN Sparcstation5 with SunOS 4.1.4 and every time I
upgrade Fvwm to the latest patch version I forget about this problem and
it hits me again.  Can this be fixed?

It won't? Oh really? Works fine for me.

Same here. In addition, I'm running X11R6.1, and not Openlook, if that
is a difference. (Openlook is frustratingly slow and buggy.)

time. is there a patch for this?  
Thanks.

I'm not positive what you mean when you say "error log," but I have used
the -debug option of fvwm2 and nothing of any signigcance seems to be
reported (if that is what that option is for, for that matter).  I can
make fvwm respond with a few "Can not load FvwmButtons" errors for
whatever reason, but when I correct the problem, it returns to silence
and with no improvement.  I have abandoned using config options in the
.fvwm2rc file altogether and am now using only the *FvwmButtonsFile
command to specify the file from which I get to do my groping.

The first time I try to invoke FvwmButtons is at startup with this
command:
 
AddToFunc "InitFunction"         "I" Module FvwmButtons

then at restart with:

AddToFunc "RestartFunction" 	 "I" Module FvwmButtons

next from a popup:

AddToMenu FvwmModules "Button-Bar"    Module  FvwmButtons

I can tell that it tries to load each time because when I purposely
misconfigure something, it gives me the error message.  The ModulePath
is set correctly (no symlinks, even).  The config file I am using is as
minimalist as I know to make it: no configuration options and only one
measly button.  Although, I have tried it with several options including
size, color, buttons, location, etc.  Nothing I change, other than
making it obviously 'wrong' seems to produce any kind of effect other
than making the error messages go away.  I should note that when i do a
'ps' I can see the everything that is currently running in X, including
other modules, but not FvwmButtons.  It simply isn't starting.  

Anyone have any more ideas before I have to go back to fvwm1.xx?

Believe it or not, I waited until now to notice one little detail.  That
being that FvwmButtons causes a coredump every time it tries to start,
no matter how it tries to start.  Take FvwmButtons out of the
InitFunction and don't manually start it and no coredump.  Since I have
had the same results with 4 different copies/versions of the binary
itself, and since no one else seems to be having any problems, it has to
be something about my 'setup.'  As to what, I am not with clue.  With
this in mind, any ideas (again)? Thanks in advance.

I had the same problem also...on Digital Unix.  That was when I compiled it 
with the DEC cc compiler.  I recompiled with gcc and not a problem.  Although
I still get a coredump when I use a particular configuration I have here.  I 
am getting around that by using the sample fvwmrc file and moulding it to my
needs.  I think there could be a few system problems with 2.0.43...after all
it is still beta. :-)

Can anyone think of any libraries or the like that I can try upgrading
or installing that might have some effect on my troubles?  I just tried
another window manager (hated it), and though I am able to get it's
version of Buttons working, it is working only barely (can't configure
it worth spit; missing icons that ARE there, etc.).  I want my FvwMtv! 
;)  Thanks again.

Subject: FVWM: Starting apps ?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

Hi,

is it possible that ALL launched applications open with fixed size
and on a fixed Position ?

Actually I use a taskbar(tkgoodstuff) vertical on the left side.
All apps are starting behind this taskbar.... :-(
and I have to move them to the right side.
For some apps I can choose positions in the startup, but not for all.

Is there a possibility to avoid this starting behavior for all apps ?

best regards,

You can set the

Hmmm.  Do you have a line like *FvwmButtonsFont None in your config?
I found that caused a core dump when I started using the new
FvwmButtons.  It shouldn't be necessary to use that line anymore.

I'm not sure this is the right place for this, but I need some help
installing any version (1.24+) of fvwm.

I used to use fvwm on a decstation 5000/120, don't know what version but
it was 2 years ago...  Since starting my employment here I've been using a
hewlett packard series 700.

The most used window manager here is tvtwm, but I didn't like it and
wanted to go back to fvwm.  We can install basically what we like, but I
don't have root.  If I know exactly what has to be done then I can
probably get someone who is root to do it for me.

I'm not that experienced at installing unix software, so I don't know if I
have everything I need.  I just thought, "if tvtwm can work, surely fvwm
will?"

Anybody willing to help?

I still have all my old configurations for .fvwmrc at university, so I
don't need to write those from scratch, though if that version of fvwm is
not compatible with whatever version I install there could be problems.

Hi,

I've just spent about 6 hours to find a bug in FvwmButtons,  and I
thought I just let you know, because one might have the same problem and
not have the time nor the devotion to really find out why the hell it
doesn't work as described:-)

The bug happens when swallowing other windows like that:

*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "XLoad" Exec xload -nolabel &
*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "XClock" Exec xclock&

What happened to me was, it executed and swallowed xload just fine,
executed xclock fine as well, but didn't swallow it. This was just
because I had another copy of xclock running. Thus, whenever you have a
copy of the program you want to swallow running, it won't swallow it.

This is on Solaris 2.5, 2.4, 2.3. I haven't tried SunOS yet. The window
manager was fvwm-2.0.43.

Hope that helps someone. Currently I don't have the time to look deeper
into the src to find the bug myself because I have some real work to do.
Maybe in a couple of month, but I guess/hope someone will have fixed it
by then.

  Guenther

	It's not supposed to.  That's what the "UseOld" option to Swallow is 
for, no?

No, but my wording was a bit unclear. Let me rephrase it:


*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "XLoad" Exec xload -nolabel &
*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "XClock" Exec xclock&

What happened to me was, it executed and swallowed xload just fine,
executed xclock fine as well, but didn't swallow it. This was just
because I had another copy of xclock running. Thus, whenever you have a
copy of the program you want to swallow running, it won't swallow the
newly executed one, which is a bug (and it doesn't swallow the old one,
which is correct, unless you use "UseOld" option :-).

You don't need to really install fvwm to get it run.  It'll run out of
your local directories just fine.  You just have to set up the paths
properly in your .fvwmrc/.fvwm2rc file (eg ModulePath, PixmapPath).

Now, if you do want to really install it, then the directions are all
pretty much in the tar file with the source.  See the new official web
page to find where to get the latest version:

                     http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/

It sure should.  I know people on this list have compiled and run it

have any problems.

I'm sure someone will who has done this on HPs before, if you have any
more difficulties.

The latest beta version is 2.0.43, and the next version will be the
first official 2.xx version (2.1.0).  There have been no other
official releases since 1.24r.  The 2.xx rc file syntax is not
compatable with the 1.24r style, but a script is included in the tar
file that can give you a hand in converting it, plus a list of changes
in the FAQ can help you convert by hand as well.  It isn't (or rather
shouldn't be) that bad.

Trebor - 
My understanding of what Guenther said was that FvwmButtons won't swallow a
_new_ copy of a program that you already have running. Apparently, Guenther
wants two copys of xclock, one on his button bar, one not. This is reasonable,
and the software should allow it.

any differences with the new style syntax ?
I've had some problems with the compatibility parameters and therefore
switched to the new syntax.

But I suspect a logical problem in the code. (simply a race condition):

Maybe the clock appears too fast, since the code is already in core.
I think, FvwmButtons looks for some sort of window creation event. 
If that one has already passed, it won't find the window.

Hmm, good idea, but I just tested (again, just to be sure I am not
telling nonsense :-) that this is not the case. I just started xclock&
in a shell, then did a restart fvwm2 and the FvwMButtons module comes up
again with the place for the clock reserved, but empty. An xclock comes
up as well. Then I wait until everything has settled down. After that I
execute xclock & in my shell, but it doesn't get swallowed. I guess that
when the option "UseOld" is not present, then it doesn't use old and new
ones :-) If it were a race condition it should swallow the newly created
xclock, which it doesn't.

Hi,

I've just installed fvwm-2.0.43 under Digital Unix 4.0 (formerly OSF/1) 
without any problems. The only problem is, that the window manager eats up
all cpu time it can get. 'top' always shows the 'fvwm2' process on top and
the machine is 0.0% idle: 

load averages:   1.32,  1.37,  1.34 19:22:55
71 processes:  2 running, 1 waiting, 31 sleeping, 35 idle
Cpu states: 76.8% user,  0.0% nice, 23.3% system,  0.0% idle
Memory: Real: 40M/123M act/tot  Virtual: 43M/155M use/tot  Free: 31M

  PID USERNAME PRI NICE  SIZE   RES STATE   TIME    CPU COMMAND
  641 tom       52    0 3464K  106K run    29:55 81.90% fvwm2
  768 root      42    0 1888K  237K WAIT    2:12  6.50% gtar
 2118 tom       44    0 3040K  344K run     0:00  3.60% top

Question: Anyone knows a cure for that?

Thanks -- Tom

P.S: I was running fvwm-1.24r under OSF/1 3.2D without any problems but
     now need to go to fvwm-2.0.43 since the old fvwm-1 apparently
     has problems with window titles.

P.P.S: This is X11R6!

Hi,

As a followup to my previous mailing: I just noticed that it is *not* the
properly running fvwm2 process which eats up the CPU time, it's an fvwm2
process left from a previous X session!!

Apparently under some circumstances the fvwm2 process as well as the
FvwmButtons process do not die properly when I log out and the X server
dies. 

I can easily reproduce that: I log in and press the "mail" button in
my FvwmButtons box. A decterm is opened with the mailer and the
mail button stays pressed. Now when I just terminate the session,
by stopping the dxsession manager (which causes the X server to die),
I can see 'fvwm2' and 'FvwmButtons' still running and eating CPU time
when I log-in from a remote terminal.

Anyone knows what I could do about that ?

Thanks everybody -- Tom

Yes. Apparently.

Well. I do it like this:

   a.) The X Server is started
   b.) dtlogin is started and I log-in selecting dxsession
   c.) dxsession starts up and I've configured it to use
       /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/fvwm2 rather than /usr/bin/X11/mwm.
   d.) dxsession executes the .X11Startup file to startup my
       initial apps.

When I want to log-out, I use the dxsession's logout command which
apparently causes the x-server to die without fvwm2 noticeing.

Please note that this works without problems when I select the
standard Motif Window manager. It also worked without problems
using fvwm-1.24r

What can I do about it? I mean: What happens if the X server dies
for other reasons in your configuration? Then you run into the same
problems and fvwm2 will eat up CPU time as well. I think that fvwm
should just die when the X server died.

Thanks for your reply -- Tom

One problem with FvwmButtons is that in its cleanup code it does
   signal(SIG_PIPE, SIG_IGN);
and then tries to communicate with the server. If the server connection has
been broken - as in the case here - this results in FvwmButtons going into
a tight CPU-consuming loop [at least on my platform, Sun Solaris 2.4].

This sort of server shutdown/reset also happens on multiscreen displays,
which is how I found it. I have made a change to FvwmButtons to try and
fix this problem (by changing the signal handling to 'exit' instead of
SIG_IGN). I haven't checked to see if other Fvwm modules, or the main
code, has this problem too, though. I also haven't posted the change
to list [yet].


Just checked fvwm itself; it may have this problem too, since it
installs a signal handler (DeadPipe) which, in effect, ignores
the signal (it just reinstalls itself). Problem is, of course, that
fvwm *can* get SIGPIPE signals that it is legitimate to ignore (when
communicating with a module). If the code can check to see if the X
server (connection) is dead in the signal handler, and exit() if it
isn't, then the problem may disappear. Something like:
   struct stat buf;
   if (fstat(XConnectionNumber(dpy), &buf) == -1) exit(1);
(assuming 'struct stat' and 'fstat' are, in this usage, 100% portable,
*and* presuming fstat returns -1 on a dead, but not closed, pipe.)

I'll try this out shortly (oh, the joys of XNest).

Thank you for clearifying (sp?) this. While I didn't intent to run to copies of the
xclock, I just happend to run an xclock while I was modifying my .fvwm2rc and
experienced, that the swallow command wouldn't work as expected. After finding this
bug (btw. it exsists on SunOS, X11R6 also, just installed and tested it :-), I think
that it _is_ reasonable to have two copies of a program running, one in the button
bar, and one not, although I don't intend to. What's more important, though, is that
new users probably won't spend hours to find the cause why swallow doesn't work as
expected, as I did.

Hi, It has three days from now that I tried to compile FVWM-2.0.42, and I got so may
"undefinced reference" error messages,
	It never happened to me before when I used FVWM-2.0.42 with kernel 1.2.13, after I
upgraded my kernel to 2.0.15 and FVWM-2.0.43, things was changed, I don't know what is wrong.
Would you please help me to solve this problem? I have GCC-2.7.2 which I upgraded follwing 
instruction provided by GCC-HOWTO.

If your change is working, I'd appreciate if you could post it to the
list together with the change for fvwm itself.

I am involved in a project to write an X application.  We are using
only xlib, no widget sets as all, and are having a strange interaction
problem with fvwm (v. 1.24r).

I like autoraise, and the app won't autoraise.  I've seen this also
with a few nonstandard programs, like WABI programs and a few others
written specifically for solaris, but every generic X program has
always autoraised fine.

There is a possibly related problem in that the focus never entered
the programs window, either.  We fixed that by explicitly requesting
it (though I thought you weren't supposed to do that), but even so,
keystrokes don't get passed on to the program.

Neither of these problems happen with other window managers that I've
tested: olwm and olvwm, ctwm, perhaps others.  But two of us have had
this problem with fvwm.  Our configurations are quite different and it
happens under both linux and solaris, so I don't think it is just a
configuration or OS bug.

I read in a fvwm FAQ a question like this, but the answer was
basically "RTFM" without telling me which FM to R.  If someone could
point me to the right FM I will R it.

Thanks,
