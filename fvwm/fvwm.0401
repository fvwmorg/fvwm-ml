Happy new year everybody!

(Maybe this is pretty basic, but I often get confused about the fvwm /
X syntax for screen location)

I have a very quiet FVWM setup, I spend >8 hours behind a PC, so I
don't want a lot of eyecandy :-) Here's a screenshot:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~kiar/desktop.png . I've been using it for a
while but there are a few things I'm not content with.

Right now, minimized apps are stacked from left to right in the left
bottom part of the screen. They have an icon, some use their own, the
ones that don't have one get it via a style.

What I would like is this:

- minimized apps don't have icons (not even if they have their own on
  board), only a title in a small bar
- minimized apps stack in the right bottom part of the screen, from
  bottom to top
- minimized apps have a fixed width, no matter the size of the title

Something like this:

------------------------------------------------
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                              |
|                                       --------
|                                       |app 3 |
|                                       --------
|                                       |app 2 |
|                                       --------
|                                       |app 1 |
------------------------------------------------

I hope someone can help me on this one, if I have to do it myself it
would trial and error and take a lot of time :-\

Aother question: a few weeks ago I switched from RH9 to FC1 (Fedora).
I had RH9 configured so it didn't use the alpha mousecursors and I
could do things like:

CursorStyle POSITION left_ptr orange black
CursorStyle TITLE    left_ptr orange black

However, I can't remember how I disabled the fancy cursors... Does
anyone know how I can tell FC1 to use the basic mousecursors?

Thanks for any help!

Once again a happy new year, and another question :-)

My FVWM setup gives me 4 screens (I hope this is the correct term). I
arrange tasks so they are logically grouped on the different screens,
and I can switch between the screens with key combinations.

One problem: I'm on screen 1, typing in mutt, goto screen 2 to in
order to lookup something in Google, start typing and noting happens
(well maybe I'm destroying stuff on screen 1 :-)

IIRC there used to be a tool called FvwmTrackFocus.pl that would
enable you to automatically set focus to a window on the screen you're
on (I never got it working though). Google doesn't tell me a lot about
this, does it still exist? (or better yet) has it been integrated?

Thanks!

I think you want FvwmWinList.  I do this with the apps (actually windows -
there may be multiple windows per app) right now except I have the the list of
minimized windows in the middle of the right side.  Here is the ConfigFvwmList
I use:

##########################FvwmWinList##################################
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmWinList: *
*FvwmWinList: Back #908090
*FvwmWinList: Fore Black
*FvwmWinList: Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinList: Action Click1 Iconify false, Focus
*FvwmWinList: Action Click2 Iconify toggle
*FvwmWinList: Action Click3 Module FvwmIdent
*FvwmWinList: UseSkipList
*FvwmWinList: Geometry +0-1

You can imagine what an alpha cursor looks like on that. Like Gary

I would like to make a shortcut to switch between the previous and
current desk/page. Something like Alt-tab does for windows (I would
settle for just the current and previous ones on the stack, but it
would be nice to have the whole history actually).

Any suggestions?

I use control alt left and right to switch like this:

Key Right A MC Scroll  100000 0
Key Left  A MC Scroll -100000 0

> but it would be nice to have the whole history actually).

Here's my setup: http://www.xs4all.nl/~kiar/fvwm_grey.tar.bz2
and a screenshot: http://www.xs4all.nl/~kiar/desktop.png

Use at your own risk, I'm _no_ FVWM expert, but I've been using (and
tuning) this setup for a while and I like it.

To flip pages/desks use one of:

  GotoDesk prev
  GotoPage prev
  GotoDeskAndPage prev

If you want a whole history, setup your own recorder/player, for example
using FvwmEvent listenning to new_page/new_desk, or by writting a short
fvwm module in Perl working with the PageInfo tracker.

Mikhael.

Hello list,
I want to use FvwmApplet-DigitalClock from fvwm-themes and I made it
transparent and with nice antialiased fonts. Now I want but it in
fvwmbuttons, but there it has the background of the area, where the
script was started and not where it is now. To make it clearer, you can
look at http://doppelhertz.homelinux.org/transparent-error.png in the
lower left corner. So how do I either start the script in its place, or
how can I solve the problem?

Best regards
	Klaus

If this list will permit a brief philosophical exchange, I would like to 
ask what problem you have with icons. I can understand not caring for 
their appearance, but it seems to be the utilitarian rather than 
aesthetic types who typically reject icons.

The screen space occupied by a 14x14 pixel mini-icon could at best 
display three small characters in a program's name. An FVWMButtons panel 
with mini-icons can be functional with only the narrow icon column 
visible, whereas a text-only panel requires that multiple letters of 
each program's name be visible.

Impossible to say without seeing your configuration.

Works for me with this config (copy and paste into FvwmConsole if you
don't believe):

  Colorset 23 Transparent, fg black
  Style FvwmButtons ParentalRelativity

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons-Test: *
  *FvwmButtons-Test: Geometry 100x100+100+100
  *FvwmButtons-Test: Colorset 23
  *FvwmButtons-Test: (Swallow "FvwmApplet-DigitalClock" \
    `FvwmScript FvwmApplet-DigitalClock 23`)

  FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-Test

I checked Xft.h and it's the same as the stock one from the XFree86

When I start fvwm, I immedialetly fire up some small apps / modules
(gkrellm, the pager, fvwmwinlist). Also I have hotkeys to start apps,
like this:

  Key x A CM Exec exec xterm -T xterm

When fvwm is freshly started and I press control-alt-x an xterm is
aterted (as I would expect), but it doesn't have the focus. When I
start another one, that second one will have focus. I thought about
ginving fvwmwinlist a skipwindowlist style, but the list skips as it
is...

Can anybody tell me if this (not giving focus to the first app
started) is normal behaviour from fvwmwinlist? Thanks!

Hi,

I want to achieve something like this (in pseudocode):

if $HOSTNAME == "host1" then
	Exec Command1
else
	Exec Command2
fi

Unfortunately, I can't find in the manpage any command for conditional
execution, which would test environment variables.

Do I really have to resort to a preprocessor?

Thanks,
Piotr Zgorecki

You may configure fvwm so this is a normal behaviour and may configure
fvwm so this does not happen.

An ideal report/question looks like this:

  1) My fvwm version is x.y.z. [Other relevant info if you think it may
     contribute to the problem.]
  2) Here is a minimal rc file that reproduces my problem.
     [Several fvwm commands (seven or so) follow.]
  3) Run fvwm with this minimal file instead of .fvwm2rc and
     press Ctrl-Alt-X. After doing this I expect some window to get
     focus, instead another window [which one?] is focused.

Also please name all things their own names. You say "list", "fvwmlist",
"fvwmwinlist", do you mean FvwmWinList in all cases or something else?

BTW, try:

  Style FvwmWinList NeverFocus

Mikhael.

X uses the term "screen" to mean something different.

Looking into your screenshot from another message, you use one virtual
desk with 4 virtual pages each (or more precisely, 2x2 pages).

If you switch from the one desk with 4 pages layout to the 4 desks with
one page layout (arranged as 2x2 in FvwmPager, with or without desk
labels), you get the focused window remembered for each desk separately.

If you speak about the module that Google returns on "FvwmTrackFocus"
query, then you need 2.5.x in order to run it. It is not integrated.

Just tried it with 4 desks, 2x2 pages each, seems to work, although I
don't quite like the fact that the window under pointer may end up non
focused, instead the previously focused window on that page is forced.
Probably good if you use keyboard to switch desks/pages, but not mouse.

Please always specify your fvwm version in every message. Do not imply
that others remember/didn't delete your other messages. Another reason is
that you may run several fvwm versions at home and at work, and you may
just switch fvwm versions between your messages to the list, noone knows.

Regards,
Mikhael.

In this special case, i use a cleaner approach to achieve the same:
in the end of my fvwm2rc (which is the same on all my machines) i have a:
    Read "rc.local"
The rc.local is different on each machine, and contains machine-specific 
settings. Of course, this has not the full power of what you're asking, but 
it's sufficient for what I need.

cheers,
Remko

Ok, I think that I can reproduce your problem if I redefine Colorset 23
above to use RootTransparent instead of Transparent and restart
FvwmButtons. Then the background of the swallowed part is drawn
incorrectly, it is refreshed correctly when FvwmButtons is moved.

So the temporary solution for you is to use a colorset with "Transparent"
(like above) for swallowed modules and a colorset with "RootTransparent"
for FvwmButtons.

I suppose this initial drawing problem when swallowed modules use
RootTransparent (but not Transparent) may be fixed. Just like another
problem, refreshing FvwmButtons after WindowShade when FvwmButtons uses
Transparent colorset (but not RootTransparent).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can't reproduce your problem.

When I run "mplayer" and press "f", it puts itself in the fullscreen mode
and into layer 10. This is higher that the StaysOnTop layer of gkrellm,
that is 6 by default unless you redefine DefaultLayers.

The man page of mplayer contains some information about the layer used
in fullscreen mode, you may want to read the mplayer man page.

In any case, issue FvwmIdent on both gkrellm and fullscreen-ed mplayer
and report their layer. (I hope you may bind FvwmIdent to some key.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Your Xft.h does not include freetype/freetype.h. Indeed, Seems that
you use a very recent XFree. In 4.4.0-rc2 Xft.h, the freetype are
included as:

#include FT_FREETYPE_H

and not as

#include <freetype/freetype.h>


FT_FREETYPE_H is defined in freetype/config/ftheader.h which is
included (here) by Xft.h via ft2build.h. Seems that some old version
of ft has no ft2build.h. Maybe 2 versions of freetype2 are installed
on your machine (typically, one under /usr and an other one under
/usr/X11R6) and this leads to various problems. You may try to use the
--with-freetype-prefix= or the --with-freetype-exec-prefix= options to
configure so that the good freetype2 includes are used.

Mplayer works fine for me .. the problem is with tvtime...

In 2.5.8 gkrellm is on Layer 6 and tvtime is on Layer 4

But in 2.5.7(I downgraded and tested) tvtime goes into full screen
properly... even though gkrellm is on Layer 6 .. I'm unable to get FvwmIdent
output on the tvtime window in fullscreen... but in regular mode it is on
Layer 4.  (Strangely though I hit the key to run fvwmident when the window is
in full screen... the ident window seems to come up after the window goes
back to normal as it still shows the regular sized windows resolution )

I've been trying for some time now but can't get it to work. My
original setup is this:

DesktopSize 2x2

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmPager 0 0

What should I change to get the 4 desks with one page setup? Thanks!

Hello,

First some clarifications. 2.5.8 support the ewmh way to go full screen
(_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN) and 2.5.7 does not. I can reproduce the
mozilla disappearing problem with 2.5.7, I cannot with 2.5.8.

One point is that an application (here mozilla) can use different
method to go full screen regardless the fact the wm support or not the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN state. If you switch from 2.5.7 to 2.5.8 with
a restart, mozilla can think that 2.5.8 does not support the
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN state.

About layer. It will be good to have fullscreenLayer style, we have
not. But you should try:

	Style * EWMHUseStackingOrderHints

which puts (ewmh) full screen window at the default top layer.

Yes, when I test this my conclusion was that this is a mozilla bug
(mozilla ask this, maybe there is a style workaround).

This is what I was doing until now... I now added "fvwm2" to the last line of
my .xinitrc and exited fvwm... and a new instance started up.

Now Mozilla/Firebird disappear more frequently than before... and even when
they do go full screen they still have the border and titlebar.

This helped fix the problems of gkrellm staying on top of other full screened
applications.
[ie., tvtime now runs on Layer 4 in windowed mode, and Layer 6 in full screen.]

But is it really necessary to add that line because everything was working
fine on 2.5.7 even without that extra line. Since this is "expected behavior"
wouldn't it be better if it was turned on by default ?(ie., not having to
turn it on in the config.

Neither Olivier nor me may reproduce decorations and disappearing.

Are you sure you run the final 2.5.8 or later and not something else?

Please start FvwmConsole and report what is the FvwmConsole version
you see, then execute this command in FvwmConsole and report what is
the fvwm version you see:

  Exec xterm -e 'echo "$[version.line]"; sleep 30'

Please use "fvwm", not "fvwm2" to start fvwm, and verify your $PATH.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does someone else that is sure to run 2.5.8 and mozilla 1.4 or
a recent Firebird can reproduce this?

It does not work fine with 2.5.7. For example, with gnome-terminal 2
and others gnome2 apps full screen does not work at all. Also, mozilla
some time disappeared :o/

I do not know what is the "expected behavior" about layer of
fullscreen window. I do not think that there is an expected behavior
at all about layer of windows regarding theirs type. This depends on
the apps and of your general setup. Here, everything is configured so
that every windows has layer 4. For example, when I use mozilla in
fullscreen mode I may want to take a look to my download manager or to
gkrellm. As everything as layer 4 I just have to raise/lower.  There
is also an interesting complaint from a gimp developer and gimp
fullscreen with some wm which use the "expected behavior" (moreover as
it is the/a non configurable wm you cannot "fix" the problem).

I am sure that you can configure fvwm to use layer and get a
functional desktop. Typically, one want to have certain app as the
TaskBar or gkrellm on top. This is fine for me.  However, I do not use
layers because I think that there is a more powerful method which is
conditional auto-raise:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: *
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: PassId
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: enter_window FuncFvwmEnterWindow
*FvwmEvent-AutoRaise: leave_window FuncFvwmLeaveWindow

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmEnterWindow
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmEnterWindow
+ I WindowId $0 (gkrellm) Raise
+ I WindowId $0 (FvwmTaskBar) Raise
+ I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager*) Raise
# ...etc

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmSpecialRaise
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmSpecialRaise
+ I All (gkrellm) Raise
+ I All (FvwmTaskBar) Raise
+ I All (FvwmPager*) Raise
# ...etc

# a key binding for FuncFvwmSpecialRaise

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmLeaveWindow
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmLeaveWindow
# one may want to auto lower certain app (or cancel scheduled
# cmd)

This is just the idea, one may use the schedule cmd to get a delay.

When you have no layer you have your full desktop to work with normal
applications. With conditional autoraise some special apps are easy to
access/view.

This is just the way *I* work with my computer. Again, one can prefer
layers. The good point is that I hope fvwm can be configured to fit
the needs of most users. Also, I think that using a non configurable
wm has some advantage for some users.

Hi to all

I want to change the color of the cursor in the root window with
  CursorStyle ROOT left_ptr red black

This worked with fvwm 2.4.8 under suse linux 8.1 but does not work for
fvwm 2.5.7 under suse linux 9.

Any ideas?

TIA

Rudolf

I think what you call "window" is a "page" in fvwm terminology.

I have this in my config file to switch pages with Alt-F1 ...
Alt-F4:

  Key F1 A M GotoPage 0 0
  Key F2 A M GotoPage 1 0
  Key F3 A M GotoPage 0 1

Complex functions are handled like this:

  Top level functions:

    1. All "I"mmediate actions are executed in the same order they
       appear in the function.
    2. If there are any other actions, fvwm decides whether the
       action is a "C"lick, "D"ouble click, "M"ove or "H"old
       action.  It usually has to wait for user input.
    3. All actions of the given type are executed in the same
       order they appear in the function.

  Functions called by other functions:

    These should just use the "I" action type so everything is
    executed once they are called.

Of course you have to generate a "minimal-rc" config file first
and put it in the .fvwm2rc directory.

It *is* in the man page:

  Style * SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement, CleverPlacementOff
    -->
  Style * TileCascadePlacement

It may be a bit confusing since it explicitly lists
CleverPlacementOff which is the default.

-> Just remove "RandomPlacement".  It does nothing here since it
does not change what you specified with the "*" style.  If you
want to disable SmartPlacement for these windows, use

  Style ... CascadePlacement

(or in 2.2:  Style ... DumbPlacement, RandomPlacement)

No, the script apparently does not handle commands buried in
decors.  Just change it manually.

I don't think so.  The current FvwmButtons version has a way to
change the image associated with a button, but this has to be
triggered by fvwm (look in the FvwmButtons man page).

I don't know.  It works fine with the latest development code.

It seems that your distribution defined alpha-blended animated cursors.
You should disable this, probably ask on SuSE specific mailing lists.

There was one answer on this list some days ago about disabling the
cursor theme, but this procedure may be distribition (or XFree86 version)
specific, since it didn't work for one who asked then.

Mikhael.

It appears that Red Hat does this as well (XFree86 Version 4.3.0 (Red Hat
Enterprise Linux release: 4.3.0-35.EL)).

If anyone determines how to disable them from messing with the cursor,
let me know.  I tried the FVWM way and there was no change.

Thanks.

Hi,

I need a solution to give focus to the top most window that accepts
focus. Any ideas?

At first, I tried     
    Next (AcceptsFocus,Raised) Focus 
But this doesn't do what I want if the currently raised window is one
that doesn't accept focus. In this case I want the second highest window
to get focus, or, if the second highest doesn't accept focus, the third
highest, and so on.

Felix

I have thought about similar issues. Can't think of an easy way to do it
(guess writing a new module would be possible).
Maybe what would be needed is "Topmost" and "Bottommost" commands, like
this:
Topmost (AcceptsFocus) Focus
or maybe Topmost (CurrentPage,AcceptsFocus) Focus

Are we using topmost in the visual sense?

It seems to me there are many "topmost" windows.
I know there are on my desktop.

I think we could do:

Next (!Obscured) Focus

but I don't see much point to it.

Hello,
some time ago I wrote a little perl script in order to set a
random background image and recently I added some features and made
an Fvwm module out of it. It's called FvwmRandomBack and it's
pretty simple but for me it does what it is supposed to do and I
thought that maybe someone else might find it useful. I put it up
for download at http://www.guido-berhoerster.org/downloads/ (at
the bottom of the page).
FvwmRandomBack depends on the Image::Magick perl module which is
part of ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org). In order to
install FvwmRandomBack simply put it somewhere within Fvwm's
ModulePath and make it execuatble.
Here is its included manpage:
----snip----
NAME
       FvwmRandomBack - a FVWM module to display a random image in the root
       window

SYNOPSIS
       Module FvwmRandomBack

       FvwmRandomBack can only be invoked by fvwm. Command line invocation of
       the module will not work.

DESCRIPTION
       FvwmRandomBack recursively searches a directory for all images in GIF,
       JPEG, PNG, or XPM format, selects one randomly and displays it in the
       root window.

       If the image is bigger than the current viewport it will be resized and
       cropped accordingly. Otherwise it will either be tiled or optionally
       magnified.  FvwmRandomBack uses ImageMagick's perl module in order to
       modify and convert the image and fvwm-root to set the root window.

INVOCATION
       FvwmRandomBack can be invoked by fvwm with the command 'Module
       FvwmRandomBack' at any time. After setting the root window to a random
       image it will exit. It might be convenient to invoke FvwmRandomBack
       during initialization by adding

           AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmRandomBack

       to the fvwm configuration file.

       FvwmRandomBack needs to be executable and must reside in a directory
       which is listed in ModulePath.

OPTIONS
       *FvwmRandomBack: ImagePath path
            The path where the images can be found.

       *FvwmRandomBack: TmpDir path
            Specifies the directory where a temporary copy of the image will
            be stored in.

       *FvwmRandomBack: Magnify
            Magnify images which are smaller than the current viewport instead
            of tiling them.

       *FvwmRandomBack: RetainPixmap
            Causes FvwmBacker to retain and publish the Pixmap with which the
            background has been set. For more information see the FvwmTheme
            manpage and the fvwm-root manpage.

There is no much to comment, since it is a small short-lived script.
But there are some notes that are correct for any FVWM module written in
Perl, so this may be useful to all Perl writers.

First, you may replace all 3 "use Some::Module;" lines with one:

  use FVWM::Module::Toolkit qw( File::Find Image::Magick );

This loads the specified perl classes, or shows a nice error window if
any of them are not installed on the user's system and exits.

Optionally, you may replace "new FVWM::Module" with "new
FVWM::Module::Toolkit", the first class writes all debug, errors and
messages to standard output, the second opens dialog windows instead,
this may be more user friendly or more annoying, depending on a module.

Run "fvwm-perllib man FVWM::Tracker::PageInfo" to see how to find the
screen dimensions in your module.

Regards,

I have the same problem on Fedora Core 1 (with XFree86 4.3.0). I have
a feeling this is XFree, not the distro. If someone has an answer I
would really like to know, these alpha cursor are really ugly in my
setup.

Exactly. That would be nice.

> Are we using topmost in the visual sense?

Not necessarily. I assume FVWM manages a list internally in order to know in 
which order to draw windows, e.g. when a screen update happens. A command like
topmost would go through that list, starting from the highest window and 
proceed step by step to the lowest window if necessary.

No, that's not what I want. For example, I often have the problem that a
nonfocusable button bar obscures the topmost focusable window. Then I
want that window to be focused (and maybe raised). Here's a little illustration:

                    +-----------+
                    |some window|
              +-------------+   |
              | some window |----------+
        +---------------+   | currently|
        |Topmost        |---+ focused  |
     +-------+ focusable| |   window   |
     |BUTTONS| window   | +------------+
     +-------+----------+

After changing them manually, I get:

  [FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> Command can not be added to a decor; executing command now: 'HilightFore black, HilightBack green'
  [FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'HilightFore'

and 6 more sets, one for each decor that tries to do this.  All
borders get the black/yellow highlight.

The error message is fully correct, only five *Style commands are
accepted in decors. Please see the man page (search for AddToDecor), it
includes the correct usage example, convert your configuration similarly.

This turns out to be a nice simplification.  The only reason I had
multiple decors in 2.2.4 was to get different highlight colors.
Now that the highlight colors go directly in the Style command,
all the extra decors can go away.

After some investigations I finally found this solution:

insert the following line into your ~/.Xdefaults

Xcursor.core: true

Here I've a file:

x11_prefix/lib/X11/icons/default/index.theme

which conatians

[Icon Theme]
Inherits=redglass

If I replace redglass by core, I get the "default" cursor.
Maybe there is a user space corresponding config file.

Having an xmessage pop up is more informative than a log message,

I must have overlooked this one, it's much better than relying on

This may not be the right place to ask this, but I thought I'd try.

I'm building v2.5.8 from source into a SRPM/RPM.  When I go to install
the RPM, I get the following:

: linux13 23#; rpm -Uvh fvwm-CTCINT-2.5.8-02.i386.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
        perl(Gtk) is needed by fvwm-CTCINT-2.5.8-02
    Suggested resolutions:
        Gtk-Perl-0.7008-31.i386.rpm

I didn't compile Gtk into FVWM, so I'm not sure why this is coming up. 
Any suggestions?

Yes, probably rpm related mailing lists would be a better place to ask.
You didn't specify your system, your rpmbuild version and your way to
create this rpm. I guess you used your own procedure, not our:

  make rpm-dist release="2.CTCINT"

Use --nodeps, or just install the suggested package. Gtk.pm is needed by
FvwmGtkDebug module, although it should be fine to run this module even
without this package (you get a message window suggesting what to do).

Or if you may rebuild rpm, build it on an old system or with another
rpmbuild version so it does not add any perl(Something) dependancies.
Or maybe you may just convince your current rpmbuild not to add this,
since such dependances are not really required for every user.

Mikhael.

I just noticed that your script has a non GNU GPL compatible license.
(Or maybe it is compatible, hard to say, this is not really important.)

Not only this disallows the script to be included into fvwm in one or
another form, but I think this is not legal. Since this script depends
on the GPL'd library FVWM::Module, it should be GPL'd as well.

Of course, any private usage of the library for any purpose is welcome,
the issue only becomes relevant when you start distribute your script
(that happens to be an fvwm module) to others.

I hope you will correct the license.

Mikhael.

Perhaps someone who has understood the solution could make an FAQ

It is the modified BSD-License and compatible with the GPL, see

Since it is GPL-compatible it may very well be included into fvwm. The
module code itself does not contain any code from the fvwm sources but
uses the library at runtime, I would consider this as something like
dynamic linking against a library, please see
http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue38/kidd.html#free-software
(a quote from RMS)
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfInterpreterIsGPL (last
paragraph mentions this case) and
So in my understanding this is legal, please feel free to prove me
wrong.

Well, it's already publicly available, so I'm kind of
distributing it. Coming from a *BSD-background I prefer the
BSD-License since it has less restrictions but should it not be
legal (I'm not convinced yet) I will change it to GPL.

Ok, I think I have no problem if the code in the script is under the
new BSDL (I didn't recognize it), and the resulting script executable is
covered by the GNU GPL, as quoted.

However I think it may be considered good if all code that depends on the
GNU GPL'd library is at least dual licensed, making derivatives under GNU
GPL trivial (or interoperability trivial, for this reason). Currently my
understanding is that the BSDL header should be left untouched in the
derived GPL'd work, that is a nonsense.

If my understanding is wrong and the BSDL header (anything under the
copyright notice) may be just replaced with the GNU GPL'd header then
there is no any issue.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't know, what you mean. I don't know, wheather my changes to the
script (I even don't know anymore, what I changed :-) ) affected this
somehow, but it was a mistake with transparent and roottransparent.
But I send you my version in addition to this mail.

I also modified it to a simple transparent apm-battery-script, but I
don't have it here anymore, because I did that for my girlfriend. :-)
But after I have brazed my own laptops mainboard, I will rewrite it to
an acpi-battery-controll, which I'll send you of course.

Well in contrast to the GPL the main point of the (modified)
BSD-License is to give credit to the author, so the copyright
line and the two license conditions and the disclaimer need to be
preserved. I think the GPL header is quite similar to this, see
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC4
But other than that there are no restrictions, everybody is free
to do whatever her or she wants to do with it, it may be included
in a GPL'd project or it may even be used in a commercial closed
source program. I prefer this kind of freedom but I have no
objections against the GPL either, it's a matter of philosophy
and personal preference. Should I ever write something which is
less simple and more useful or which might even be included in
fvwm I will put it under the GPL (which is probably longer than
this tiny module).

FYI, I finally solved that problem by creating a function

    AddToFunc LowerPanel 
    + I Next (FvwmButtons,CurrentDesk) Lower 

After executing it by pressing a key combination, I can execute

    AddToFunc FocusRaised
    + I Next (AcceptsFocus,Raised,CurrentDesk) Focus

to focus a focusable window that was originally below the button bar.

Still, TopMost and BottomMost commands would be nice to have in reserve.

Ok, I am glad you understand that having only one license in the project
enourmously simplifies all things, you should never ever think about
legal issues. The issue is very real, since maintaining multiple scripts
and modules always means patching all of them on many occasions.

The best way is to post an url here, if you can upload it somewhere.

Hi there,

I wrote a simple FvwmSript which controls and displays the
status of an isdn interface. I planed to invoke this script
several times with different script arguments for different
internet providers. E.g.

Module FvwmScript isdn.FvwmScript providername1 ippp0 ippp5
Module FvwmScript isdn.FvwmScript providername2 ippp1 ippp6
Module FvwmScript isdn.FvwmScript providername3 ippp2 ippp7

I tried to make the window title generic to get the
different script-module swallowed by FvwmButtons. But when
using a line like:

WindowTitle (GetScriptArgument 1)

I got a parse error from the module. It seems that the
windows title can be a fixed string only. 

Is this true? If so, is there a way to have different
versions of the same script running and get them swallowed
by FvwmButtons?

As always, thanks in advance.

Cheers, Uwe

I have a strange behavior in mozilla-firebird. If I change the title
theme to noTitle before I load a webpage then mozilla-firebird stops
responding to keyboard input. If I first load a webpage (any webpage)
and only then change the theme to noTitle then everything is fine.
Any idea to whats causing this?
(I tried doing it both from the keyboard short cut and a menu entry)

Yes, unfortunately this is a "grave" miss feature. At multip times
I thought to implemented ChangeTitle 0 str, but never do it ...

I think that there is a real bug here. FvwmButtons seems troubled when
it has to swallow 1 apps (or more) with "name" foo and when 2 windows
(or more) with the name "foo" map or are already mapped.

Does anyone happen to have the code handy to enable flipping to the
next/previous desktop or dragging a window to the next/previous desktop
by going off the top/bottom of the screen?
I want the same behavior with desktops in this case as with pages.
I have 4 rows of 4 pages each row in its own desktop. This enables better
partitioning of the windowlist menu, but I want the dragging
ability. It seems from the man page that this is possible with some
code but doesn't look immediate.
Currently I am using menu items to do this.

Is there anyway to pass more than just the path to MissingSubmenuFunction?

I have a menu like this:

DestroyMenu MenuMultimedia
AddToMenu MenuMultimedia
+   MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
(...)
+   ""                                      Nop
+   %hardware_video_camera_display.png%"Browse Videos"  Popup
$[fvwm_video_path]
+   %music_notes_view.png%"Browse Music"    Popup $[fvwm_audio_path]
+   %graphics_presentation_person.png%"Browse Images"   Popup
$[fvwm_image_path]

It would be cool if i could pass some other arguments to
MissingSubmenuFunction to specify an icon/--exec-file to use depending on
menu selected, but there doesnt seem to be an easy way to do this..This is
what I've done right now, but I'm sure there is a better way:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
AddToFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ I PipeRead 'myexec=gvim mypng=file_text_view.png; \
    case $0 in \
        $[fvwm_rom_path]*) myexec=$[fvwm_rom_exec]
mypng=games_puzzles_dice.png;; \
        $[fvwm_video_path]*) myexec=$[fvwm_video_exec] mypng=film.png;; \
        $[fvwm_audio_path]*) myexec=$[fvwm_audio_exec] mypng=audio.png;; \
        $[fvwm_image_path]*) myexec=$[fvwm_image_exec]
mypng=graphics_presentation_person.png;; \
    esac; \
    fvwm-menu-directory --icon-title folder_view.png --icon-file ${mypng}
--icon-dir folder_paper_closed.png \
    --dir $0 --xterm exec --exec-file ${myexec}'

I'm using 2.5.8, my fvwm2rc is here

No, there is no way. And this is indeed quite limited if one wants to
define non-trivial dynamical menus.

This is the best way until there is a way to pass more parameter to the
MissingSubmenuFunction's function than the missing menu name, say:

  Popup (PassArgs "argument-1" "argument-2" "argument-3") missing-menu

I am not sure I fully understand your setup and you requirements, but
I think the following should answer your question.

To be able to drag windows into other pages using interactive Move
command, but not switch to other pages in other situations, use something
like:

  EdgeScroll 0 0
  EdgeResistance 1000 10

You can't drag a window using interactive Move command into other desks.
However you may drag a mini window inside the pager into other desks.

Another way to do this is to use MoveToDesk commands in key/mouse
bindings or menu items.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I already have that set up.

It looks like you can since you can set up the edge of the screen to
perform operations when then mouse is over. The same method that would
allow to show/hide a panel.
Just though someone may have it handy, I'll try to figure out how to
use it.

Hello list,
is it possible, to let fvwm do something in the background?
With the help of Tavis Ormandy, I have a nice function now, to have
a thumbnail of an iconified window for the icon. It really looks
beautiful, but it takes some time, to iconify a fullscreen-window (2-3
secs!).
While fvwm is working on that thumbnail-function, I cannot do anything,
is it possible, put it in the background, so I don't have to wait
anymore, until I can work?

regards
	Klaus

No, that doesn't help, I still cannot do anything while this function is
processed.

Try replacing "PipeRead" with "Exec".

I already tried that that, for some reason it does not work.
I tried
+ I Exec exec xwd -silent -id $[w.id] > $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].xwd
and
+ I Exec exec "xwd -silent -id $[w.id] > $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].xwd"

5) People say Linux is ugly. How does that make you feel?
Torvalds: They'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes.
	  Let's see just how ugly they think it is when they have a few

No, just replacing will not work here. You can't Iconify until the
screenshot is taken.

You may avoid any freeze if you use this technology:

  DestroyFunc Thumbnail
  AddToFunc   Thumbnail
  + I Raise
  + I Exec create-xwd; FvwmCommand 'WindowId $[w.id] Iconify on'; \
    create-png; FvwmCommand 'WindowId $[w.id] WindowStyle Icon icon.png'

(Just don't forget to run FvwmCommandS in StartFunction.)

But then the results are unpredictable, you may lower your window or move
it outside the screen and the snapshot will be broken. Or you may Iconify
the window for the second time by a mistake (using the same function
obviously), then you may have real troubles with files.

There is no way to prevent all these problems without locking, i.e.
you would better wait in PipeRead.

Regards,
Mikhael.

No, you can't.

No fvwm commands and functions may be executed in the middle of the
interactive Move, including EdgeCommand functions if this is what you
meant.

If I understand you correctly you have 16 pages on every desk (64 pages
with 4 desks). Do you really need so many empty pages?

The desks/pages philosophy is: every desk has its own windows that may
ocuppy several pages and its own focused window. You may move windows
from one desk to another, but if you want to do this all the time, then
you probably do not want to use desks, just use one desk with many pages.

Regards,
Mikhael.

But only taking the screenshot has to be done synchronously.  Try

  DestroyFunc Thumbnail
  AddToFunc Thumbnail
  + I Raise
  + I PipeRead "xwd -silent -id $[w.id] \
      > $[HOME]/.fvwm/icon.tmp.$[w.id].xwd"
  + I Iconify
  + I Exec FvwmCommand 'WindowId $[w.id] Iconify on'; \
      create-png; \
      FvwmCommand 'WindowId $[w.id] WindowStyle Icon icon.png'

For the sake of correctness, the marked part above should be removed.
It is important to do "Iconify" in the function and not in Exec to avoid
the double-iconify-corrupts-files problem. And to hope that Exec is
finished before the user deiconifies/iconifies the window again to avoid
the same problem.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I have inadvertently deleted my iconstyles file from my .fvwm 
directory... I was wondering if someone on the list could donate me theirs?

Mine was originally derived from one created by fvwmthemes, with a few 
additions, so if someone has one along those lines that would be great.

Thanks!

Andy

Just get this file from fvwm-themes, it is possible you have it on your
disk, do "locate style-icon-miniicon".

You may also try to undelete your file, it surely worked for me.
If you know that you added, for example, this unique line:

  Style myownprogram Icon ...

then use this string to undelete your file (if possible), like explained
in http://recover.sourceforge.net/unix/ .

Mikhael.

Hi there,

Using acrobat reader with several documents  spreading  over
several  desks  gives a strange behaviour. When a dialog box
is opened  say  to  save  a  file  the  dialog  box  appears
sometimes  on  another  desktop  where  are  also windows of
acrobat reader. 

Is there an fvwm option to avoid this? I would like that the
dialog boxes open on the actual desk.

Cheers, Uwe

I want to load a FvwmPager module on desk 1, say.  I've tried
GotoDesk 0 1 in StartFunction, but it never seems to be executed.

How do I start a window on another desktop?

Thanks,
-josh

Here is the explanation from the code (placement.c):

  /* Select a desk to put the window on (in list of priority):
   * 1. Sticky Windows stay on the current desk.
   * 2. Windows specified with StartsOnDesk go where specified
   * 3. Put it on the desk it was on before the restart.
   * 4. Transients go on the same desk as their parents.
   * 5. Window groups stay together (if the KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk
   * style is used). */

Because of #4, dialog windows appear on the same desk as the
transientfor window.  I agree this can be confusing when you close
the application and save dialogs pop up on random desks.

An option controlling this would be in order, but I think it
would not help a lot.  Normally you do not want popups appear on
the current desk when the application is somewhere else.

I suggest you exploit either #1 or #2 from the list above.  This
is probably the easiest:

  Style <annoying window name> StickyAcrossDesks

Set a style:

  Style FvwmPagerDesk1 StartsOnDesk 1

and start the pager with the name given in the style:

  FvwmPager FvwmPagerDesk1 ...

I see. One should distinguish between transient windows
which apear automatically e.g. error messages and transient
windows which were opened by the user e.g. dialog windows.
But this seems to be a general problem (not of fvwm).

Well, the window's name is just "Open" or "Save". So not
very suitable for a special style.

As a workaround I disabled

Style * SkipMapping

to see the window at least ;-) For the first time I was
confused since the window apeared on another desk and the
viewport did not change. 

I used SkipMapping since I got an application which pops up
small window during compilation to show what it does
(Compiling, Linking, ...)

Thanks.

Cheers, Uwe

Use FvwmIdent on the window.  Maybe it has a suitable class or
resource name.  In acroread, the open dialog has the resource
name "OpenDlg".

Is it possible to take my SetEnv defined colors and translate them into 
symbolic colors useable by an xpm? This seems possible with FVWMCPP, but 
I've got not idea where even to begin.

Thank you,

No, FVWM does not support symbolic colors in XPM.

If it ever supports symbolic colors (fg, bg, sh, hi) in XPM, then you
will need to define them in the colorset that is used in the area where
your XPM image is drawn.

But maybe if you explain what you need exactly there is a different way
to achieve this than to use XPM symbolic colors (like used, say, in CDE).
For example, you may generate XPM dynamically (using "FvwmCPP -debug
-noread", or maybe "FvwmPerl -p" or a shell script) and use this
generated image for your needs.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
    I just started using fvwm-2.2.4.  I want to have a feature similar 
to Alt-tab that is present in windows to switch between various 
applications in fvwm using Ctrl-tab.  Any documentation which describes 
how to set this up?  Please cc me in responses as I am not yet 
registered in the mailing list.

TIA
-Prasanna

2.2.4 is too old.
Use a current release, for example 2.4.17
and alt-tab will work by default.

Yes, I should have started with this.

I have declared (SetEnv) four strings at the top of my fvwm2rc file 
representing  foreground, background,  outline , and desktop color 
definitions. I would like to use these colors in some way to color 
three-color xmps without having to define the colors anywhere else in 
the file.

I apologize, Mikhael, for the personal email. It was unintentional.

If you want a generic way to do this, then, like I said, this is not
supported. However it probably may be solve case by case if we know where
you plan to use such XPMs. For example, titlebar vector buttons support
drawing using bg, fg, sh and hi colors of the corresponding colorset.

You may partially achieve what you want if you use colorsets, transparent
XPM and alpha blended PNG images to draw different things. Then you may
just change colorset definitions at any time and transparent images will
adapt to a new background and the text will use a new foreground color.
If we speak about menus, modules and decorations.

You may read about colorsets in the man pages. See fvwm-themes package
for colorset usage examples.

Please always specify your fvwm version, because there are different
receipts for different versions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I have two titlebar buttons where vector graphics should work, but my 
real problem is xpms which I use across the entire titlebar in order to 
simulate a border between the titlebar and the window (like twm). One of 
these problem xpms has three colors. The background color checkered with 
the foreground color and then a strip of border color along the bottom.

I am using version 2.5.8

Thank you for all of your help.

Hello list,

is it possible, to change the RootMenu dynamicaly?
I want applications, that are already started and must not be started
a second time, like gaim and xmms to disappear in my RootMenu.
I tried

Piperead 'if ps aux | grep treibho | grep gaim | grep -v grep > /dev/null; then echo "+ \"ICQ%\$[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/36x36/apps/licq.png%\"      Exec gaim"; fi'

but that seems not to work. Any ideas?

Regards
	Klaus

The shot looks nice.  I  am  going  to  addit  to  the  fvwm
screenshot  page soon. Could you please provide your .fvwmrc
and the used icons and pixmaps so that we can put it on  the
web site as well? 

Thanks.

Cheers, Uwe

I got things right, piperead creates the menu only once. You need to
explicitly destroy and recreate the menu each time (or when relevant).
Here is an example of what I use to create a dynamic unread mail status
menu (if anyone is interested in the script itself, mail me. Its not
very efficient and it only handles Maildirs, but it works ;-)

DestroyMenu Mail
AddToMenu Mail Mail Title
+ DynamicPopUpAction	Function read-mail-dir

DestroyFunc read-mail-dir
AddToFunc read-mail-dir
+ I DestroyMenu Mail
+ I AddToMenu Mail "Mail" Title
+ I PipeRead '~/.fvwm/maildir_status.sh ~/Maildir'
+ I AddToMenu Mail DynamicPopDownAction Function destroy-mail-dir

DestroyFunc destroy-mail-dir
AddToFunc destroy-mail-dir
+ I DestroyMenu Mail
+ I AddToMenu Mail "Mail" Title

Hi!

I've been trying to make some changes to my FvwmButtons-bar I havn't
been able to make it look the way I want. Thus, some help would be
greatly appreciated. I guess it will be pretty trivial for the expert.

I'll try to illustrate what I'm trying to do with some simple
ascii-drawing.

Current look:

I.e. I want the bar centered at the bottom of the screen and only taking
up as much space as it "wants" to. FWIW, my current FvwmButtons
configuration:

    SetEnv BorderWidth 1
    SetEnv FvwmButtonsBorderWidth 3
    SetEnv FvwmButtonsHeight 30
    SetEnv TitleBarHeight 14

    PipeRead `printf "SetEnv FvwmButtonsWidth "; expr $[vp.width] - $[FvwmButtonsBorderWidth] - $[FvwmButtonsBorderWidth]`
    PipeRead `printf "SetEnv WorkSpaceHeight "; expr $[vp.height] - $[FvwmButtonsBorderWidth] - $[FvwmButtonsHeight] - $[FvwmButtonsBorderWidth] - $[TitleBarHeight] - $[BorderWidth] - $[BorderWidth]`
    PipeRead `printf "SetEnv WorkSpaceWidth "; expr $[vp.width] - $[BorderWidth] - $ [BorderWidth]`

Dear Colleague,

Happy New Year!

As we know, codon preference among different species could be dramatically =
different.  To enhance the expression level of a foreign protein in a parti=
cular expression system (E.coli, Yeast, Insect, or Mammalian cell), it is v=
ery important to adjust the codon frequency of the foreign protein to match=
 that of the host expression system.  One classic example is GFP (green flu=
orescent protein) which was optimized to achieve high-level of expression i=
n mammalian cells.=20

GenScript has developed a proprietary algorithm for codon optimization.  Th=
is algorithm can optimize sequences for protein expression using either you=
r own codon usage table or those from publicly available codon usage databa=
se.  It can converts your amino acid sequence into a DNA sequence with over=
all codon usage similar to a specified organism, and also optimizes the RNA=
 secondary structure, GC content, repetitive codons etc. Using Genscript op=
timized synthetic genes, many of our customers have reported dramatic incre=
ase on protein expression.=20

The optimized gene can be synthesized by GenScript gene synthesis technolog=
y with 100% fidelity.  The cost is as low as $2.35 per base pair.  Our serv=
ice is very flexible, we can clone the optimized gene into our standard vec=
tors (without extra charge), or any expression vector that you provide (for=
 $400 extra charge).

Gene synthesis is a powerful technology and it has many other applications.=
  Another application example is to replace PCR Cloning.  Please visit our =
web (http://www.genscript.com/gene_synthesis.html) to learn more about this=
 technology.=20=20

Besides Gene Synthesis, we also provide custom vector-based siRNA, siRNA ca=
ssette, peptide, oligo, cloning and protein expression, biochemical reagent=
s, and labwares.  Please visit our web site (http://www.genscript.com) to l=
earn more about our services.

The entire configuration is a bit to much ;-) It would be
nice if you could make a smaller package which contains one
"big" .fvwm2rc and the images for the window decoration. If
you do not have the time to do that I could add a link to
your screenshot description which points to
  http://iamsotona.narod.ru/fvwm/fvwm-config.tar.bz2 
if you are going to leave this file at this location.

Cheers, Uwe

File will continue to be at this location (after all, this is my own backup
:), so I would prefer if you link it as it is. After all, it is much more
interesting for me if someone will also use my scripts, not just ten stupid
pixmaps. :)

Maybe it could support a syntax something like this (in a possible
future) (in the XPM):

". s cs1bg"
", s cs1hi"
": s cs1sh"

For enabling the use of several coloursets in the same file.
bg,fg,sh,hi (without a colourset) could refer to the colourset of the
"context" where the XPM is used (for example title bar).

I was also thinking of using XPMs with colours from my "theme" as
root image, but this would require creating temporary files (script,
perl etc.)
By the way, is it possible to "query" FVWM for the current definition of
coloursets via FvwmCommand? (for use in a script to set the root
image).

FvwmCommand is not the best way to query colorsets, but tricks like the
following are possible:

  % FvwmCommand 'PipeRead "echo $[fg.cs1] $[bg.cs1] >/tmp/cs1.txt"'
  % cat /tmp/cs1.txt

It is easy to write a module in Perl that queries the colorset definitions
(including image properties that can't be queried ourside of modules).
You just create Colorsets tracker object and it does all the black work
for your module to keep an up to date information about all colorsets.

If you take this path, run "fvwm-perllib man" from a shell, and
"FvwmDebug --xconsole --track Colorsets" from FvwmConsole in 2.5.x.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Mozilla stops responding to my keyboard input sometimes. It seems
to happen to me randomly, I can't reproduce it with your instructions..

To get keyboard input back, I just click Edit -> Find in this page...
in the mozilla menu bar, and type something. after that keyboard input
is restored...

Can you try to send more detailed instructions, like the actual fvwm
commands you used to to reproduce this.?

This is not a fvwm bug ... people are experiencing this bug on windows too!

I use the following function:

DestroyFunc title-bar-toggle
AddToFunc title-bar-toggle
+ "I" ThisWindow (State 11) WindowStyle Title
+ "I" TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title
+ "I" State 11 toggle

Assigned to a kb shortcut A-C-Ins and to a menu item to remove the
title from a window (maximize screen usage, small laptop 14" lcd).

When used to remove the title from mozilla-firebird when it first comes
up (just started, including quit and restart) then the keyboard stops
responding. Restoring the title bar restores the keyboard.
I set it up to start by default with a blank page, no home page. If
after starting I load a page and only then remove the title bar then
everything works fine.
fvwm version is 2.5.9 mozilla-firebird version 1.5 system is debian
unstable.

   I have similar problem, it looks like sometime mozilla's focus is on 
strange widget (not sure where) that does not do anything, once I click 
on something that accepts keyboard then it works.

   another example is mail window - let's say focus is in index (list of 
emails), then I do something that changes focus to another window (e.g. 
popup or another app), when mozilla gets focus back the currently 
selected widget is not the same, almost no keyboard input works except 
of arrow up or down changes focus back to index (the border around list 
becomes bold, the current message gets active color etc.)

   happens under linux and freebsd... not sure if it has anything to do 
with fvwm, the window seems to get focus, just not the right widget...

I have this problem in icewm and fvwm. But in fvwm it seems to happen 
more often. Also MozillaFirbird seems to have this problem more often 
than the normal Mozilla.

In icewm it helps to change the desktop and return back. In fvwm this 
does not help. Here I have to open a new mozilla window and close the 
old one. This does not help every time, but in most cases.

Funnily enough, I have ditched mozilla and started using
mozilla-firebird because of this very same problem. It is apparently
caused by using a certain kind (?) of drop-down menu in mozilla.
mozilla-firebird has worked perfectly for me so far . . .

"mozilla-firebird" is debian specific though, and I believe it is patched.

Actually, I run it on FreeBSD, and my wife runs it under windows. 
Before that, I ran it on Gentoo.  It's as "cross-platform" as mozilla
itself...

I'm trying to override the Icons that are set by the programs themselves with
icons of my own...

I've defined the Icon and MiniIcon using the Icon and MiniIcon for each of
the apps.

The styles wouldn't apply when the apps are launched.. but if I restart fvwm
after the app is launched the Icons/MiniIcons are changed.

I tried adding the following line to my rc file...

Style * IconOverride, EWMHMiniIconOverride

There is no change in the behavior at all... the apps still use the
application defined Icon at startup and not what I have specified for them.

Where am I going wrong ?

Am using 2.5.9(jan 5th snapshot)

You cannot apply the IconOverride style in this way. You *have* to make it
application specific in the style, i.e.:

Style MyProgramName IconOverride, EWMHMiniIconOverride

for each application, repeat as necessary.

That is what I tried at first.. and it didn't work out... thats why I tried
the using Style * IconOverride, EWMHMiniIconOverride

The way I understand the man page... Style * should also work...

Because the man page clearly states ...

"There is one exception to these rules, namely

                   Style * Icon unknown.xpm

doesn't force the unknown.xpm icon on every window,"

So applying IconOverride, EWMHMiniIconOverride on "*" should also be
possible.

Will the winning logo(s) soon be present on the homepage?
I would like the submit the news to "http://www.xwinman.org".
I wrote an e-mail to the guy running that site in time for the
anniversery, but he wanted to wait until the new logo was presented, and
then perhaps write an article on FVWM.

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to specify different 
border/handle widths for top, bottom, left or right borders?

What I'm trying to achieve is a window border style something like the
default Openbox style i.e. single pixel borders around the window but
with a larger border at the bottom of the window (to make it easier to
resize).

TIA

At the moment this is not possible. But it has been discussed to implement
such a feature sometime.

version 2.5.8

I have written a working perl script to read colors from my .fvwm2rc 
file and build appropriately colored icons. The script *works* from the 
command line, but fails when called from .fvwm2rc. with
FvwmPerl load create-icons.fpl

Here is a minimal version of my perl script. There are some lines 
commented out. The script works, but is of course useless, without these 
lines. With these lines, the output file fails to open when called from 
.fvwm2rc.

#!/usr/bin/perl
open(FVWM, "/home/shay/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc");
undef $/;
$_ = <FVWM>;
close FVWM;
# /SetEnv FGColor "(.*[^"])"\n/g;
# $FGC = $1;
open(OUT, ">/home/shay/.fvwm/iconify.xpm");   
print OUT "\". c $FGC\",\n";
close OUT;

Any help appreciated. I have worked on this a lot and have become very 
frustrated.

 -Shay

This doesn't appear to do anything useful what so ever, in fact i'd be
surprised if it ever passed perl syntax check.
  `perl -cw script.pl`

Contact me off-list with information on what you need to achieve and
i'll try to help ye out.

The correct syntax is:

  FvwmPerl --load create-icons.fpl

But why do you need FvwmPerl at all here? It seems that your script does
not use any FvwmPerl features and does not send any fvwm commands back,
so you may just do:

  Exec create-icons

Or if you need syncronization, then:

  PipeRead create-icons

Sorry, it is impossible to determine why your script fails. Maybe because
you don't use the correct FvwmPerl syntax (--load). Or maybe because the
files can't be open, or there is some perl error (but then FvwmPerl
should catch it and report on the X standard error file).

You may use some sane programming techniques to make programs more solid
and less buggy. For example, ask Perl to help you with such goal by
starting the script with:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	use strict;

Never write:

	open(...);

If you want to catch problems, write something like:

	open(...) or die "Can't open file $fileName: $!\n";

Never write:

	/..(..)../;
	$color = $1;

$1 will contain random garbage if there is no match. Write something like:

	if (/..(..)../) {
		$color = $1;
	}

or:

	/..(..)../ and $color = $1;

or:

	/..(..)../ || die "Expected string not found";
	$color = $1;


There are several ways to preprocess XPM with symbolic colors to final
XPM. Which one is better depends on your goals and setup. You may just
call a shell/perl script when you start fvwm to create all final XPMs.
Or use one of these to do this:

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmCpp -debug -lock -noread -outfile processed.xpm unprocessed.xpm
  ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl --preprocess --nosend --noremove unprocessed.xpm

(and not "FvwmPerl --load").

Another solution is to preprocess your whole configuration (and not just
icons) using "FvwmPerl -p .fvwm2rc.ppp" and create the needed icons in
the embeded perl of this .fvwm2rc.ppp file.

Finally, you may write your own fvwm module if you want so and listen to
colorset info from fvwm.

But if you don't want to do a lot of programming, then I think the
easiest solution for you is to prepare the final XPM sets statically and
just use one or another ImagePath depending on your color scheme:

  ImagePath $[FVWM_USERDIR]/images/red-color-scheme:+

Then prepare ~/.fvwm/images/red-color-scheme/iconify.xpm and so on.

Regards,
Mikhael.

If he doesn't understand the syntax why should he write it? There are
lots of people that say... do it this way... but don't explain why. If
you say to someone, you should do it this way... explain why and what the
syntax means.

For reference,
open(MOO,$file) or die "Barf on $file: $!\n";

If the open fails for some reason (permissions?) it will run the code
after the "or". So in this case it would die and give the message
supplied. $! in perl is a special variable containing any error messages
from external sources (ie: the file open).

blah... hhhmmm... MJD-ish

Oh, come now! Everyone knows that Perl's motto is: TMTOWTDI. The reason
why he should write it a certain way is because it is the correct way.
Mikhael did actually explain why, but not in so much detail. That is why
the man pages and copious book exist about perl

Actually $! will contain whatever error message is thrown up at that time.

Your messages in this thread suggest that Shay is pretty much ignorant of
Perl. This seems incorrect, since he wrote an XPM generation script that
worked for him from a shell.

> blah... hhhmmm... MJD-ish

The interesting thing is that I actualy thought about MJD when suggested
"use strict;".  (I happened to meet him.)  So I weighted the wording
carefully.  And, no, I don't always use this pragma myself.  My signature
would fail with it. :-)  At least it passes "use warnings;".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hej list!

Mising a comfortable way to read the man page I've started a info page
on fvwm today, mainly just porting over the the man page. As that will
be a lot of work, i though on putting it on a cvs server so other ppl
can participate. My question: Can it be put on the fvwm cvs server or
should i use savannah?

(BTW: The other purpose of that eMail was naturally to find other
info-fvwm lovers... :) )

This was a good idea, IMHO FVWM should definitely include a info file.
This will indeed require some work, but since I usually prefer info over
man I would be willing to help out with the creation.

However, creating an info page is not enough.  It must be
maintained like the man page, and I don't see anybody doing it.
I don't think we will have an up to date info page before we
switch to a different documentation source format.  Olivier has
made some efforts on this topic in the past, but did not come to a
conclusion yet.

Yes, the man pages of fvwm are hard to handle. It is a very good idea to =

split it up.

Well, I do not like the info tool. Wouldn't it be good to choose a more=20
common file format e.g. xml or something, so that several other formats=20
could be generated by tools? I e.g. would like a set of html-pages=20
instead of info.

Please read the messages and attachments in this thread to see why this
idea is not considered good:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0301/msg00181.html

Something like docbook2info would create want you want automatically.

Just for the record, I find one big man page much more confortable than
multiple info pages. For cross-link documentation I prefer html and
possibly lynx. Your effort would be ineffective and probably incompatible
for users wanting man pages and html like me. Unlike the docbook effort.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I was wondering why frame_x and frame_y are handled in FvwmPerl as
unsigned numbers.  Since the positions are given relative to the current
viewport, -1024 (e.g.) is a perfectly normal X coordinate; therefore, it
doesn't make much sense to use an unsigned number (as it'll usually need
to be converted back to a signed number to be useful.)  The C modules
treat frame_x/frame_y as ints, which are implicitly signed, so the
behavior doesn't match in that case either.

Additionally, I wanted to point out that the example in the
documentation for FVWM::Module::Gtk2 doesn't work (Gtk2 needs to be
initialized before FVWM::Module::Gtk2 if Debug is set--otherwise, the
module will explode when it tries to create the debug window.)

Thanks,

My actual intention was to code a little fvwm-mode in emacs and i
missed a info for using info-lookup-symbol and similars to directly
jump to a function definition ... 

Should we first try to port the manual and adding extra content
afterwards? That would give us a info file faster as then one write a
complete new info document? After all that would be my first time
writing a info file for documentation... :)

I read the thread but couldn't get the attachment ... 

The thread seems to die on some point?! Was there a decision?

The decision between texinfo and docbook is rather contructed as both
can be easily converted forth and back. makeinfo supports
xml, docbook, html, text and tex out of the box. Even converting it
from docbook back to info shouldn't be very hard using
http://docbook2X.sourceforge.net/ , although i never tested it in that direction...

To keep the whole thing low here, i don't asked to include the info file
in fvwm ... just for interested ppl and *maybe* a playce on cvs (before
putting it on savannah). That was no call for "I will mantain the new
documentation format"... :)

If there is the possibility to get a new documentation source format in
a reasonable time i won't say another thing about that issue (as long as
the format support info :) ) But in any other case i see no harm in
doing a info file easily portable to xml, html, docbook and tex?!

Yes, reading it often helps. I am going to stick by the manpage
idea...manpages are much easier than info pages. Their navigation sucks
even with the use of: 'pinfo'.

No, I prefer manpages for all the reasons stated thus far. It won't be
changing and as Mikhael points out, is counter productive.

I should like to think you would otherwise what's the point of starting it

I do....maintainability. The man pages are always kept upto date. If
people start wanting to read an info page which is not they'll be
mis-informed.

Huh? I can't find anything in my former mails about switching to info
format. And if you read it in it, I'm sorry ... i just wanted to
convert the man page to the info page to ease *my* pain in reading it
... i never wanted you to throw man away...

What waste could it be for me and possible some others (?) who wanted
to have it in info format to read it?!

I don't think any free software project would ever have been started
if there would be a "Don't start to code until you are willing to
mantain it or find somebdy else who do it" from all sides...

I don't want the info page to be the same as the manual ... manuals are
a totally other thing than just man pages ... i've just started to add
a few things from the man page which are important for me.... And there
will be no "mis-leading" in calling it alpha and put a note in
it.

It's because of this sentence:

In any case, if we ever switch the documentation source format,
the man page will still be the most important output format.  If,
with a certain source format, we can't easily have a man page of
at least the quality it is now, that source format is
inacceptable.  Other than that the decision should be made by ease
or use, maintainability and how it supports other output formats.
It's probably wise not to require installing a documentation
package that is hard to set up.

I wrote that because the thread mainly focused on whether to use docbook,
man, pod, info etc...

If it is planned to use docbook i'm very happy about it as that would
make it very easy for me to get my info page...

Sorry, if my cited sentence lead you to the conclusion i want to
discuss the matter of the official documentation format. Just forget it
as it was never writte... :) I just wanted to find maybe some
co-workers and a place to put ( i will submit on savannah when others
are interested in helping)

That was the reason i send that mail to "Fvwm Users" and not to
Workers...

Please don't refer to the FVWM Perl library as FvwmPerl. You may refer
to it as "fvwm perllib". FvwmPerl is just one concrete module for
preprocessing and scripting purposes that happens to use this library.

You are right, I will mark these fields to be signed in FVWM::EventNames.

You are right, I will fix this.

It seems the examples are also broken in that $dialog->window returns now
undef for me if called before $dialog->show_all. It worked just fine.
I am not sure what was changed in my setup since the last time it worked,
X, GTK or the fvwm's way of mapping windows. Anyway, I will fix the
command order too.

Mikhael.

Sorry, I wasn't thinking about that when I wrote the mail--FvwmPerl just
popped into my head (no doubt because of previous references to that
module.)

My conclusions was:

1) Convert all our man page into XML "FVWM DocBook" format. So, the
new source doc will be fvwm/fvwm.xml,modules/FvwmButtons/FvwmButtons.xml,
bin/fvwm-root.xml ...etc. Use a new dtd (DocBook + some restriction + some
special tags for fvwm style, fvwm command ...etc.). docbook-xml as is,
is not what we/I want we should customize it.

2) We should distribute our man page (other format is an other story)
so we should convert the xml docs into man pages. There are _no_ tools
that allows to do the conversion from XML-DB to height quality manpage
(as we have now). So, we should do it ourself. I've started to write a
xslt stylesheet that can do this.

3) Other formats: for html docbook-xml + some customization can give
good result. It is not so easy to get good ps/pdf output (via tex or
fo), there are various tools (e.g., jade, passivetex and fop). I am
sure that we can get good info page.

4) All the active fvwm workers should be happy with editing the new .xml
files. 

5) All these need a lot of work. I do not have the time now, but if
someone wants to do it, (s)he is welcome. I may help at the beginning.

What I've noted about all these tools that convert a format to an other
is that I'am rarely happy with the result. In general you need either
to reparse the result or add some custumization.

There exists at least one searchable manpage reader, TkMan. 
<http://tkman.sourceforge.net/>  Besides being able to search, it can 
collapse sections of the manpage to their headers, like an outline. It's 
very good for taming overgrown manpages such as fvwm's.

Being one of the people who voted for the logo that won - what a great 
design - I got to wondering what Aquatint would do with it.  Aquatint is 
an elegant little program for MacOS X that does only one thing - it 
"liquefies" a shape.  I'm _not_ promoting my experimental variations in 
any way, but I posted them just for fun. I couldn't turn it into a tabby 
cat though :-)

Very nice, this is what I meant in:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0401/msg00085.html

If you read this thread you may also see there is now a logo variant
with improved "F", and both logo variants are available in the huge size.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello list!

I use the following code to update a GnomeIcuPanel in my ButtonBar:
,----
| 
| #!/usr/bin/perl -w
| 
| use lib `fvwm-perllib dir`;
| use FVWM::Module;
| 
| my %status_symbols =
|   ("Online" => "/home/drache/.icq/icons/Windows ICQ/gnomeicu-online.png",
|    "Offline" => "/home/drache/.icq/icons/Windows ICQ/gnomeicu-offline.png",
|    "Away" => "/home/drache/.icq/icons/Windows ICQ/gnomeicu-away.png",
|   );
| 
| my $module = new FVWM::Module();
| 
| my $scheduler = $module->track("Scheduler");
| $scheduler->schedule(2,gnomeicu_update);
| 
| sub gnomeicu_update {
|   my $status = `gnomeicu-client icuask`;
|   if ($status =~ /^(.+?)\s(.+?)\s(.+?)\s.*/s) {
|     $module->send("SendToModule GnomeIcu ChangeButton icon Icon \"$status_symbols{$1}\"");
|     $module->send("SendToModule GnomeIcu ChangeButton icon Title " . $2 +1);
|   }
|   $scheduler->reschedule;
| }
| 
| $module->send("Module FvwmButtons GnomeIcu");
| 
| gnomeicu_update()
`----

The first call of gnomeicu_update() at the end of the script is called
but not the one in the scheduler?

I'm a straigt perl newbie so there might be a really dumb error... :)

Greetings!

Mario

How do you name and run your module? Currently for Scheduler tracker and
some other things to work, you should place your module in
$FVWM_MODULEDIR or ModulePath and run "Module module". Invoking it as
"Module /full/path/to/your/module" should fail. I plan to improve the way
Module and SendToModule work in fvwm later, so the last form works too.

If this does not help, add (Debug => 2) to your module constructor and
send the output.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just restart fvwm (to ensure all additional noisy modules are killed),
optionally run your module from FvwmConsole if not yet, and paste the
output you find in the X output file. Or just post your whole module.

Yes, very nice.

Is it possible to make also an alpha blended PNG version instead of the
current JPG on the black background, so it looks good on any dark (or
even light) background, not just black?

This last error means you didn't define Title property in you FvwmButtons
button having id "icon". So, you are not able to change the non existing
title to "0" as shown above.

Yes, this is right, and you may see there are only "sent (to fvwm)" and
no single "got (from fvwm)". Your module immediatelly exits after
reaching the end. This is not what you want. You want to make it
persistent by entering the event loop:

  $module->eventLoop;

So just add this line to the end of your module. You configured the
scheduler tracker so every 2 seconds it communicates with fvwm and
updates your FvwmButtons. So the debug output will be pretty verbose.

To break the event loop, do $module->terminate from any event handler.
Otherwise your module lives forever until fvwm closes a pipe to it on
exit or on KillModule, this is probably what you want.

Mikhael.

First, thank you, the missing $module->eventLoop was the problem, i
thought because of not wanting data from Fvwm i could leave that

In your example on the manpage you used a small sub in place of the

sure what to do about that?! I try &gnomeicu_update and
&gnomeicu_update() but i haven't worked in both cases...

And let thank you again for your help!

You may still use the syntax from the example:

  sub { gnomeicu_update(); }

But of course, you may make gnomeicu_update to be a callback directly.

> I try &gnomeicu_update and
> &gnomeicu_update() but i haven't worked in both cases...

Both of these call the function.

Use \&gnomeicu_update as a reference to the function.

Mikhael.

Hi List, 

I have following Problem: 

want to compile fvwm 2.5.8 on my new Debian 2.6.1 system. 
Now I have freetype2 installed and I have this fontconfig-config-script in /usr/bin. But nevertheless configure tells me, I don't have it installed. 
(the freetype test program failed to run. if your system uses shared libraries and they are installed outside the normal system library path, make sure the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or whatever is appropriate for your system) is correctly set). 
I use a normal Debian, so that shouldn't be...
No Idea what, but fvwm definately doesn't look so nice without.. 
Anybody have an Idea? 

Please let me know :)

Cheers, 

Julian

Awesome design! I see feline influence runs strong in fvwm. I
recently discovered the fvwm-cats page and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am
owned by two - Mugwort and Tibbins. Their Mom (a feral cat) wandered in
off the street one day and insisted on gifting me with her offspring.
Life has been very different since . . . :)

My guess is that Mom was not born feral -- more likely she had
accepted an independent lifestyle after being abandoned -- or she
would not have considered a human habitation to be a safe place.

If you haven't seen her since, she may have returned to the place
from which she got booted when they found out she was expecting.

I have created the Logos page with all submitted logos in Wiki:

  http://rvb.dyndns.org/FvwmWiki/Logos

Please feel free to create any more nice logo variants and edit this page
(you are welcome to freely edit this Wiki even if you don't create logos).

Probably Uwe will arrange some or all of these logo variants and add them
to fvwm.org later.

Regards,
Mikhael.

BorderWidth Q:

I'm trying to make my FvwmButtons completely transparent.  I've
followed the directions to use Colorset and that works, but a problem
remains.  I set the borderwidth of the buttons to zero, i.e.

Style "FvwmButtons" BorderWidth 0, CirculateSkip, StaysOnTop

but it still remains, and it seems the only way to get rid of the
border is to use 

Style "*" BorderWidth 0

but that makes all my windows have no border.  Am I missing something?
How can I tell fvwm that just the FvwmButtons have zero borderwidth?
or could i set the color of the border to transparent?  

Mouse and Key defs:

I don't understand these at all and I can't find any documentation.
For instance, what does the following mean, 

Silent Mouse 6 FSTW N RaiseAndFocus
Mouse 3 R N Menu  MP3PlaylistMenu

Just want documentation...

Launcher Q:

Following the advice of the FAQ's I tried to use the following code

     # FvwmButtons icon launcher:
     DestroyFunc Launcher
     AddToFunc Launcher
     + I DestroyModuleConfig $0Launch: *
     + I *$0Launch: Geometry 64x68
     + I *$0Launch: Columns 1
     + I *$0Launch: Rows    4
     + I *$0Launch: Frame   0
     + I *$0Launch: (1x3+0+0, Icon $1, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
     + I *$0Launch: Pixmap none
     + I *$0Launch: (1x1+0+3, Font 9x15, Fore White, Back DarkBlue, \
                    Title $0, Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $2`)
     + I Style $0Launch HandleWidth 0, NoTitle
     + I Module FvwmButtons $3 $0Launch
     # Examples:
     Launcher RXVT xterm.xpm "rxvt -bg black" "-g +0+0"
     Launcher XV   xv.xpm    "xv"   "-g +0+100"

it works great but i puts this awful nontransparent box at the
bottom.  I'd prefer to either eliminate the text box altogether or set
its color to transparent just like i did for FvwmButtons.  Is there a
way to do that?  

any help would be greatly appreciated.

Style "FvwmButtons" BorderWidth 0, CirculateSkip, StaysOnTop, HandleWidth 0

You don't need the BorderWidth 0, but it doesn't hurt.

Man page.

Search for Silent.

Searching for Mouse is harder, instead search for:

COMMANDS FOR MOUSE, KEY AND STROKE BINDINGS

The things at the end are functions.

That's the IconTitle.
Try Style $0Launch NoIconTitle

You need to set the "HandleWidth" to zero, i.e.:

Style "FvwmButtons" BorderWidth 0, CirculateSkip, StaysOnTop, HandleWidth
0

I have a music player, zinf.  In my Style section, I made is so there
isn't a title bar on the player  but if i open the playlist editor or
the preferneces, they too dont have a title bar and I am unable to move
those two items around on the screen.  The player itself can be moved.

The man page says you can set styles for class but when I do, nothing
happens

Here is how I have Zinf set up in my .fvwm2rc

 Style Zinf NoTitle,Handles,!Borders

For the Preferneces Class and the Playlist class I have this:

Style Preferences Title

Have I done this incorrectly?

No, looks good assuming you've got the right class string.

What's important here is the order of your statements as obviously
"Zinf" applies to all windows so if you set that after you set
"Preferences", the prefs setting will be overridden.

Just put the lines given in the order you gave them here and it
should work.

Hi,

I'm having trouble modifying my rc file and I'm hoping someone here can help. 
My goal is to end up with transparent (or semitransparent) title bars.  I've
seen screenshots documenting that this can be done, and I've downloaded and
tried some sample rc files, but I can never seem to acheive this. If anyone
could post the relevant commands that would produce this result that would be
excellent.  Thank a lot in advance.  I really appreciate the help, FVWM is by
far my favorite WM, using it is a true joy.

Cody

The relevant commands are in the FAQ, on the web.

Hi! I'm wondering - can an icon be positioned when a program starts up?
That is, can I when starting, for instance, an xterm, tell fvwm that I
want just this program's icon to be placed _here_ on screen. (And starting
another xterm, I can tell fvwm to position its icon someplace else?)

So I guess my question is, can I position individual icons where I'd like
them?

This would be for use in a startup script, to give me the same desktop
every time, with a number of already-started programs iconified and placed
where I like them, both windows and their icons.

Thanks in advance,
Henrik

This is what a session manager (like xsm, gnome-session or ksmserver) is
designed for. fvwm should cooperate well with it (in theory) regarding
placing icons and windows in the same position they were the last time
you saved the session.

Hay fellow fvwm lovers.
Love the new logo. Many of them where really good - a shame we couldn't
have more than one winner.

My problem is that my mouse just died and now I can't control my other
monitor. Is there a way to map a key-combination to switch between the
two heads/monitors.

Hello --

I've googled around a bit but can't seem to find
anything about how to use the wheel mouse in an fvwm
menu.  I'd like to use the wheel (Mouse 4/5) to
navigate fvwm pop-ups.  Is there a way to do this?

Thanks Much,

Tom

You can do this:

Mouse 4 R A menu MenuFvwmRoot

but if you want the scroll wheel to act like moving the
pointer, I don't think so.  Not without changing code.

i'm not quite sure how to explain this.  the symptom is that the text
at the top of every window is set too low, so the top of the
application cuts it off.  this happens for most buttonstyle,
titlestyle i've copied from other examples.  i believe the default
style, i.e. .fvwm2rc is blank as far as buttonstyle goes, is fine.  is
there something i'm missing here?  thanks.

Without a screenshot, this is difficult to diagnose, but it sounds to me
like your locale settings are out and so the font that it has defaulted
back to is ugly. What have you got $LANG and $LC_ALL set to? If you're
running debian:

apt-get install locales

and/or:

dpkg-reconfigure locales

I use en_GB.UTF8

I'd like to make my Gaim conversation window sticky, but not the buddy
list. Gaim sets 

WM_CLASS(STRING) = "gaim", "Gaim" 

for all its windows, and claims it's doing The Right Thing as you can
read here: 

http://gaim.sourceforge.net/faq.php#q20

So I need to be able to set style based on WM_WINDOW_ROLE. How do I go
about doing this?

It is currently only possible to define different window styles based on
window name, class, resource and id.

Does Gaim also set the same window name (WM_NAME) for all its windows?
If this is the case, then ask them to fix this.

Mikhael.

For the buddy list window:
WM_NAME(STRING) =3D "Buddy List"

For the conversation window:
WM_NAME(STRING) =3D "Jacob"
(it changes depending on who the conversation is with)

So I suppose I could do something like the following?

Style Gaim Sticky
Style "Buddy List" NoSticky

Are they really doing the right thing by not using a different resource?
Or has everyone done the wrong thing for so long that few window
managers support the WM_WINDOW_ROLE method? (I've had the same trouble
with WindowMaker in the past)

That should work. If you get any problems you might consider switching to
FvwmEvent
 
> Are they really doing the right thing by not using a different resource?

It depends on how the program is written and whether the programmer(s) in
question look at the ICCCM for guidelines.

It's not that they don't support WM_MODULE_ROLE, it is just that it is
easier to depict windows based on class/name.

WM_WINDOW_ROLE is for uniquely identifying windows for session
management.

I don't think they are doing the right thing.

Taking another look at this from the user perspective,
you have "gaim" windows, then you have "buddy list" or "conversation"
windows.  You don't need to resort to a third level of identification
of your windows.

Your suggestion worked.  Originally I had

TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 14

I changed it to 

TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 20

but now a separator line cuts the bottom of the text.  it's like the
text moved up but the separator line now has the same relationship
with the text as the top of the window application, i.e. the separator
line touches the bottom of the text the same way the window
application used to.  

I captured a window in a gif, but it's 150K.  Let me know if I should
send it.  Thanks for your help.

Well, if you insist on using this small decoration image for titlebar,
then you should use my other suggestion - define a smaller font.

Or don't use a decoration that is hardcoded to 14 pixels.
There are several such themes in fvwm-themes that use an image with a
horisontal line at Y=17 if you start to count from the top Y=1. On the
other hand, many themes work reasonably well with any title height.

You can't have both large font and such decorations designed for "title
height 14 or 17 with small font".

It may also sometime (not always) help to change "TitleStyle Pixmap" in
your decoration to "TitleStyle AdjustedPixmap", in 2.5.x.

No, You should not send anything larger than a few dozens of Kb to
mailing lists. But you may always post an url if you have a web space.

I would like to add the aqua theme to my fvwmrc, but it is too hard 
to extract it from the FVWM-Themes package. 

Will anybody point me at an fvwmrc with aqua-like window style ?

thank you

What I would do is to run the aqua theme as your default theme
temporarily, and then run:

touch ~/.fvwm2rc && mv ~/.fvwm2rc ~/.BACKUP-fvwm2rc && fvwm-themes-config
--expand-rc > ~/.fvwm2rc

This will then capture your current themes setting into a single file that
you can use. You'll have to copy any dependant icons across from the aqua
theme and tweak the location in the config files, etc...

Hi all,

I've been using fvwm for several years now on various platforms, and I've 
recently upgraded to an AMD 64FX51 processor, running Mandrake 9.2 RC1 for 
AMD 64 (soon to be upgraded to the shipping version).  The stable RPM version 
of fvwm wouldn't install because it did not look for the 64 bit libraries, so 
I built the 2.5.8 version.

The good news is that it's usable.  It's never crashed, and most applications 
seem fine.  The bad news is that some parts are a bit buggy.  Being 2.5.8, 
I'm not sure which parts are buggy due to it being an unstable version versus 
buggy due to being compiled for 64 bit.

Is there anyone else out there using a similar setup?  Is there any interest 
or forum for me to bring up these bugs?

Some of the things I'm seeing:

- Mouse stays as "busy clock" on empty desktop
- "FvwmButtons" icon never leaves docking panel (never finished running?)
- Cannot click on buttons in docking panel to (de-)iconify applications
- Some applications can't be moved, iconified, or resized (acroread, 
openoffice)

Thanks in advance.

You'll have to be more specific here. There's a lot about FvwmButtons in
the FAQ.

> - Cannot click on buttons in docking panel to (de-)iconify applications

Re-assign their behaviour then.

> - Some applications can't be moved, iconified, or resized (acroread, 
> openoffice)

If they're being stubborn:

Style OpenOffice NoPPosition

If that doesn't help, use FvwmEvent.

I like the most-recently-used stack method of window cycling popularized
by that other OS. I know this is a FAQ for FVWM, and several 'solutions'
have been proposed in the FAQ and the archives, but I'm not happy with
any of them. The crux of the problem is that the alt-tab sequence must
either do focus or flipfocus. What I really want to do is have alt-tab
do focus, and then when alt is released after doing several alt-tab
*then* do a flipfocus. As if I had picked it from the window list, but I
don't like the window list (which of those 10 xterms did I want?  that's
no help) However, if there was some visual indication as to which window
the windowlist entry under the cursor was referring to, that would be
good enough.

In short, I want to switch to a window with the keyboard and bring it to
the top of the windowlist without messing up the windowlist order in the
process.

Can this be done?

Hello to everyone.

I wonder if there is any clock applet available to use it with
FvwmButtons. It should be capable of xft as fvwm 2.5.8 does.

Xft works fine with my configuration, but so far the clock (I use a
swallowed xclock) does get displayed the old style.

Of course it should be a digital clock, much same way as one could see
in MS Windows taskbars.

Any hints?

I appreciate.
Alex

You can set the font style of xclock in ~/.Xdefaults (often a symlink to
~/.Xresources):

xclock*font: my_font_name

Then do:

xdrb -merge ~/.Xdefaults 

And load the clock, see if that does it.

With my XFree (4.4.0-rc1), "xclock -digital" use Xft by default;
I think that this happen too for 4.3.x.

Maybe you can try the "-fa" option (not -fn really -fa):

	xclock -digital -brief -fa "mono:size=11"
 
works fine here.

It is theoretically possible that some fvwm changes broke a 64 bit
architectures support.

However, your problems may probably have another explanation.

Can you reproduce this "busy clock" if you run "fvwm -f /dev/null", i.e.
fvwm without any configuration? If no, then invistigate "Wait" commands
in your configuration.

What is "docking panel"?

For each such application, send the output of "xwininfo -size" to see
whether the application indeed requested such size/position hints.

Also, try to run these applications with another window manager
(including an older fvwm version).

Mikhael.
