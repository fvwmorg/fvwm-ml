Hello all, I recently noticed something odd. Wine, when it opens a new
window managed by the WM, is supposed to set the class resource to
"Wine." Under fvwm 2.0.43->2.0.47b with Wine's from a year ago to
current versions, FVWM doesn't seem to catch this. For a long long
time I thought Wine just neglected to set this, but after reading some
source yesterday it looks like it does try to set "Wine."

Has anyone got any idea why this is happening? I use FvwmIdent and my
Wine windows come back with NoResource and NoClass. Trying to Style
"Wine" is also futile. I've run RH Linux 4.1 for a long time now, with
Accelerated-X 2.1 and fvwm-2.0.43 and up. I've also tried various
releases of Wine over the past year.

I really don't know much about Xlib else I'd try to figure this out
myself. Well, I'll probably try anyway, but don't expect to make much
progress. Anyway, any insight would be appreciated.

Also, I noticed that unmanaged Wine windows are Sticky and StaysOnTop,
which I didn't realize was not supposed to be the case. Any ideas on
that one either? Apparently it's the same deal under IRIX 4Dwm, for
unknown reasons. I'll also be asking the wine newsgroup, but if anyone
here's knowledgable about wine, I thought it'd be worth a shot.

"unmanaged" means "the WM doesn't know about these windows". Such windows, of
of course, will behave as if you set "Sticky" -- fvwm doesn't unmap -- and
"StaysOnTop" -- apparently such windows are always left at the top of the
window stack...

As for the class/resource names, is there a difference if you start
"wine -managed"?

Near 2000, Timothy King mumbled something about:
> 
> *FvwmPagerLabel 0 Desk
> *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Apps

Ah, so here you're setting up the labels (and just the labels)
for TWO disjoint desktops.
So there's no harm at all in these lines (nor in commenting them out).

> So I commented out the second line and now I have a "Desk" pager and a
> "Desk 1" pager. Can someone tell me how to remove the "Apps" pager.

There should be a command somewhere that reads like
Module FvwmPager 0 1
This spawns pagers for the desks 0 to 1.
Change it to
Module FvwmPager 0 0
to get only the pager for desk 0.

Hope this helps,

Excerpt from my very own .fvwm2rc (edit as desired):

Key F1     A M GotoPage 0 0
Key F2     A M GotoPage 1 0
Key F3     A M GotoPage 2 0

Key F11    A M Exec (viewlock &)
Key F12    A M Quit
Key Escape A M Exec (xsetroot -solid black &)

Hope this helps,

P.S. In reply to one of the other messages

I found this in my .fvwm2rc file as well:
*FvwmPagerGeometry  -0+0
So I only use the Geometry for the pager location, not for its size.

I think the following fvwm functions will do what you want.   Just a little
bit of background.   I run fvwm with 9 pages, arranged in a 3x3 grid.  I
have EdgeResistance 10000 10000, all page and desktops changes have to be
done via these macros.

I have setup the keypad so that <ALT>KP_[1-9] move me to a page on the
current desktop.   The <SHIFT> modifier to this switches me between desks.
(note that I use desks 0-9).   The <CTRL> modifier has the effect of
dragging the window that I am currently in with me to the new page/desk.   
I do not have page/desk access on a single keyset with the exception of
desk 0, page 0.

Hi,

I just switched from fvwm2 to fvwm95. The function "WindowShade", that I really
liked in fvwm2 is apparently missing in fvwm95. Is there any way to achieve the
same behaviour even in fvwm95?

Cheer,

Klaus

a swallowed window, such that another (hidden) app is started? I'm thinking
of, say, xload -- which is a commonly swallowed program in many buttonbars.
When you click on it, it might start top. Or swallow one of the clock pgms
(xclock, rclock, etc), and a click on that might start a program that would
pop up a calendar, or an appointment book, or start a saytime pgm. I use
xeyes as a swallowed pgm. It strikes me this'd be a neat thing to click on
to start a screen lock (as opposed to popping up the utilities menu and
moving to the screen lock section). Of course, this would only work on a
swallowed window, but it seems to me this'd be a Neat Thing, if it were
possible. It'd be even better if there was a way to map button one, button
two, and button three (with or without modifiers) to do different things. 

	I'm fairly sure Afterstep (barf) has this facility in its Wharf, and
the aclock pgm (which is very neat) will allow a keyclick on it to invoke an
otherwise hidden pgm, as does asmodem. Of course, these instances are
inherent in those pgms.

Hi,

	When i try to compile the FVWMTaskbar module, it includes a
-rdynamic option, my gcc does not recognise it, what is that option for?

	Further, when it compiled to CheckLockModule, there was a fatal
error on relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections,
does anyone know what's going wrong?

Thanks

Klaus

If you don't mind my asking, why did you switch? I believe all the look and
feel of fvwm95 can be achieved using fvwm2 + FvwmTaskBar. Let me know if I'm
mistaken.

Subject: FVWM: Are you an Internet Marketer?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Dear Internet Marketer,

Are you tired of endlessly posting your ad to online classified sites that
just don't get the job done? The fact is there are over 300 such sites
scattered about the Web and frankly none of them generate enough traffic
to be worth your while. Even when someone does visit one of these sites,
your ad is hopelessly lost in a myriad of similar offerings.

The true professionals of online marketing have known for some time that
nothing creates results the way a direct bulk email campaign does. We have
assembled a complete package on one CD-ROM that will enable to get your
message out to millions for surprisingly little cost and effort.

INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1

We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the 
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!  We
added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we combined them
all, we had in  excess of 100+ million addresses in one huge file. 

We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list. 
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public by
putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This created
many duplicate addresses. They also had many program
 "generated" email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc. 
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those 
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc. 

We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to remove 
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,
 webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu,
.mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining
list, it  reduced it down to near 16 million addresses! 

So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like
using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot less money and a
lot less time!!  

Besides the 16 Million general email address we include over 400,000
TARGETED addresses of Business Opportunity Seekers, MLM'ers and
other Internet Marketers. These are people EAGER to hear about your
products and services. 
Other services charge upwards of 5 cents per address for this type of
list. We include it at no extra extra charge when you purchase Millions
Vol. 1

We also included a 5+ million "Remove/Flamer" file broken into seperate
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes. 

To help you manage your email lists, you'll find a fully functional
evaluation copy of BulkMate 4.05 on your CD. BulkMate is an indispensible
tool for the serious bulk mailer. Among its 10 utilites are the ability to
filter any address list against a remove list, sort any list
alphabetically and automatically remove dupes, remove specific domains
from any list and count the number of addresses in each list.


 "You can buy from the REST or you can buy from the BEST.   Your choice.
_____________________________

What our clients are saying:

"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over the
course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I received
less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied with my
purchase!!  Thanks Syrynx!!"

Dave Buckley
Houston,  TX


"This list is worth it's weight in gold!!  I sent out 10,000 emails for my
product and received 185 orders!  

Ann Colby
New Orleans, LA


"I am absolutely delighted! Your support is first rate. When I needed help
you were there for me. I got a real person on the phone. I've been
marketing my product now for two weeks and can't believe how many orders
I've received. I can't thank you enough!

Using Fvwm2.0.46 on a RH5.1 system.

Here is my xterm VT100 translation:

XTerm.VT100.translations: #override \
     !Ctrl<Key>Right:  		string(0x1b) string("Oc")     \n\
     None<Key>Right:       	string(0x1b) string("OC")     \n\
[sniped for brevity. I have similar translations for the other Special
keys].

when I initially startup fvwm and type (Ctrl-V, <Right>), I do get the^[OC,
as per above. Also, when I startup Vim, the mouse works fine.

Now, here is a snippet from my .fvwm2rc
Key Right       A       S2      Scroll +100 +0

i.e. NumLock+Shift+Right-arrow should pan right by one page. I did this
because I use the numeric keypad often and so I always keep the NumLock LED
on.
[nsipped for brevity again. I have similar scroll commands for Up, down,
and left keys]

This also works fine.  I am able o pan the viewport just fine.

But, after doing even a single pan via above, for some reason, my xterm
translations are screwed up!

In other words, after I do a Pan-right, and do Ctrl-V, Right in a xterm, I
get ^[[C instead of ^[OC as before! Same for all the other special keys
(left, right, up, down, pageup, pagdown)

And get  this: Even the mouse clicks are now ignored. I launch Vim in a
xterm and click and nothing happens!

I exit from my X sessio, go back to the XDM login screen and login again,
and everything works fine up until the point where I do a Shift-Right to
Scroll my pager. After that things  are messed up. Note that a simple
'Restart' doesnt fix things. I need to exit out completely.

Needless to say, this is very aggravating. It is  rendering all my xterm
based applications quite useless. Mutt, slrn, etc. 


Thank you for any help.

I think if you check again whats going on
you will find that the curses based application (Vim) is the
cause of the problem with ^[OC changing to ^[[C.
I don't see how fvwm would be involved.

I am not saying Vim is at fault.
When I have seen this in the past, the TERMINFO had an initialization
sequence that changed what keys emit, and the reset (un-initialization)
sequence didn't undo the change.

I don't follow the part about the mouse, if you are talking about
mouse clicks in the xterm window that Vim reads, it is probably
the same terminfo problem.

Hi,

Did anyone consider porting the afterstep module "Animate" to fvwm2?
I know, this wouldn't match fvwm's basic policy to use as little system
resources as possible, but on the other hand, nobody is forced to activate it
if he/she doesn't want to. ;-)

Cheers,

No. You misunderstand.

1. I fire up my X session which starts up fvwm2
2. I launch a xterm with my desired VT100 translations.
3. In my shell, (ksh), I press Ctrl=ADV, Right
   I get ^[OC which is what I have in my VT100 translations.
4. I have the following line in my .fvwm2rc to iconify any window
   Key F8 A N2 Iconify -1
5. Using this, I press F8 to minimize the xterm
6. I click on the xterm icon in the winlist to de-iconify it
7. I do step (3) again.
  =20
   This time, I get ^[[C instead of ^[OC

Note that vim, slrn, mutt, etc are not even invoked during all this.

So, what I am saying is that, using keyboard-based accelerator keys to do
_anything_ in Fvwm somehow screws up things. The above is empirical
evidence. I dont know enough about Fvwm internals to figure out why it is
happening, but happening it is.

I dont understand. Mind elaborating? Note that as I point out above, Vim
doesnt even come into the picture for things to get screwed up.

Yes, I am referring to mouse clicks in a xterm that Vim reads. Indeed, it
does sound like a terminfo problem, but I doubt Vim has anything to do wi=
th
it. I cant understand why the keycodes that my keys/mouse sends out would
be changed by any application, though!=20

Thanks for your help. Hope we can get to the bottom of this.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

The cursor arrow keys can generate a prefix of ^[O (escape capital-O,
aka SS3) or ^[[ (escape left-bracket, aka CSI).  Which prefix is used
may be set by one of the DEC Private Mode sequences.

    ^[[?1h   sets the SS3 prefix.
    ^[[?1l   resets to the CSI prefix.

One of these codes is often called when something like vi is started.
On my platform the xterm terminfo entry includes

    smcup=\E[?7l\E[?1l\E(B\E=

Try doing

    echo '\033[?1h'

after you deiconify and see whether you get your preferred prefix
back.  Alternatively try the menu on ctrl-MS2 in xterm to toggle the
Application Cursor Keys.

After that it will be a matter of searching through fvwm,
xterm, vim, etc. to see what is resetting the prefix.  Turning on
logging on the xterm may help as all escape sequences are recorded
literally.  This may not be an option as since X11R5 you need to
explicitly enable the logging feature when compiling xterm.

Sorry if this seems unclear.  The notes I made on this matter are 8
years old.  See also appcursor and friends in the xterm man page and
the Xterm Control Sequences document in X11.

All this is fascinating, but quite irrelevant.  As I said, I have
explicitly re-mapped what the various cursor keys and
Home,End,PageUp,PageDown keys produce in a xterm via my VT100*translations
resource.

I happened to choose ^[O totally at random. I didnt know it happens to be a
existing prefix (with its own name at that!)

All this is working fine with xterm, vim, slrn, mutt, etc when I am NOT
using fvwm2 as my window manager.

This is why I am convinced that this is a fvwm2 thingie. 

Consider:
1. xterm --- fine
2. vim   --- fine
3  slrn  --- fine
4. Use a 'Key' command from .fvwm2rc
5. Things break.

Is this not clear? Me thinks Fvwm2 is "resetting the prefix".

Using RH5.1

I have the following in my $HOME/.xsession (I launch X via XDM).

#!/bin/sh
...
xsetroot -cursor_name iron_cross
....
...
exec fvwm2


When fvwm2 starts up, the root cursor is reset back to its default value.
When I remove the 'exec fvwm2' line to get a nekkid X session, my root
cursor is indeed XC_iron_cross.

Why is FVWM2 resetting the cursor? I didnt see anything in 'man fvwm2'
about setting the root cursor?

Help? How do I make fvwm2 leave my root cursor alone?

Thanks,

I don't see where fvwm2 is changing the root  pointer, but adding this
to your .fvwm2rc should fix it:

AddToFunc InitFunction 	  "I" Exec xsetroot -cursor_name iron_cross

(untested)

One point that I was trying to put across is that this ought
controlled by the xterm.  It is receiving an event when a key is
pressed and is responsible for translating that into an action.  The
influence of other programs such as a wm is limited to setting options 
in xterm which alter its behaviour.  (Actually programs such as
xmodmap can alter the event that clients receive but it does not seem
relevant here.)

The vanilla xterm (i.e. without any *translations) generates one of
two actions depending on whether the state is SS3 or CSI.  My
hypothesis is that the translations only apply in one of the states.

If you can confirm this by using the vtmenu on ctrl-MS2 to toggle the
Application Cursor Keys, then it will be a matter of chasing through
to find out how fvwm is causing xterm's state to toggle.

Some other questions:

    Is there a problem when iconifying with the mouse rather than F8?
    Is there a problem if the xterm is started with -iconic?
    Do other window managers behave the same?

Thats what I thought too.

No.

Well, when I de-iconify it and F8 to iconify it again, the problem appears.

>     Do other window managers behave the same?
No.

Aaaargh! Just hit me. I think I have too "strict" a set of translations.
Gotta relax them some.

I have the following as part of the VT100 translation table:

     !Ctrl<Key>Right:  		string(0x1b) string("Oc")     \n\
     None<Key>Right:       	string(0x1b) string("OC")     \n\

Frankly, I dont completely understand this. I think what this is saying is:

1. When the Ctrl modifier ONLY and the <Right> key is pressed, send ^[Oc
2. When the <Right> key and NO modifiers are pressed, send ^[OC

My Fvwm2 command is
Key F8 A N2 Iconify 1
which says
"when the F8 key is pressed anywhere and either no modifiers or Modifier2
(NumLock in my case) are active, iconify the window"

The reason I gave the Key command as I did is that I frequently have the
Numlock key pressed since I use the numeric keypad. So, I wanted the
Iconify to work if either No modifiers **or** the numLock was active.
Actually, I dont really care about the other modifiers also. So, I guess I
need to give 'A' for 'any modifier', right? (instead of N2).

So, when the NumLock is active, my VT100 translation table has no entry for
<Right> and hence it defaults to ^[[C.

Questions:


How do I specify the translation line to say what the 'Key' line says i.e. 

 (None OR NumLock) + <Key> Right: .......

more generally, what is the syntax for this translation line? Where can I
read more about this? I read all the man pages, but they dont talk about
the syntax for this line.

Surprisingly, the mouse is still screwed up. Consider:

o Turn off NumLock
o vim 
o <F1> for help
o Click somewhere and the cursor moves there. Fine.
o Turn on NumLock
o Mouse clicks no longer move the cursor!

Thanks for staying with me, Pete.

Greetings.  I didn't find this in the FAQs:

Can someone point me toward information on "dumbing down" fvwm2 for
use as a window manager for a public web-based (netscape) kiosk.
The users will have access to the keyboard, mouse, netscape and helper
applications, but I'd like to limit access to any other applications.
(I don't have to implement total security through fvwm2.)

I suspect an appropriate .fvwm2rc would do the job.  (Do I just
need to remove menus?)

Please cc any replies directly to me since I'm not on the list.

Thanks in advance.

I have

Style "FvwmPager" StaysOnTop

and later on in my fvwm2rc

Style "FvwmTaskBar" StaysOnTop

Since the taskbar comes last, it wins the fight and always stays on top on
all the desktops. No matter what I do, I cannot see the entire pager
window. 

If I reverse the 2 commands, the pager would presumably similarly obscure
the taskbar.

How is this resolved?  Can't 2 StaysOnTop windows peacefully co-exist?

Thanks,

I had good luck with this kind of thing using fvwm95. I chose fvwm95
because it require less configuration to make it provide a nice
Windows-like interface for our non-technical users. Here are some
hints that apply to either, working from the ground up:

Use xdm (on linux that'd be runlevel 5 default in your /etc/inittab)
Remove the entry for honoring CTR-ALT-DEL as a shutdown (can't
    remember where this is) if you're on an Intel-architecture
If your users know what they're doing w/ XFree, you'll probably want
    to turn off the CTR-ALT-BS option in your X server (didn't bother
    with this myself)
Once in FVWM, turn off all the menus except a minimal window-ops, a
    Start menu, and maybe a Start menu mirror accessed by a
    root-window click. Don't allow access to the shell. Once someone
    gets a shell prompt, game over. You lose.
With Netscape, fiddle with the .Xdefaults or app-defaults for Netscape
    so access to undesirable items isn't permitted: setting geometry
    to something like +1+1+1x1 for undesirable dialogs; commenting out
    menu entries in app-defaults; that kind of thing.
Be *very* careful about how your helpers are setup and *make sure*
    access to those configurations isn't permitted! Oh, telnet
    handling might be a good thing to get rid of, since a
    telnet://127.0.0.1 would normally be honored, with fairly bad
    consequences I imagine.

Really, there's not a lot you need to do to fvwm other than stripping
out some configurations. A lot of the work needs to be done in other
places. I never got to go into production with my kiosks, but I felt
like I'd at least put together a real solid proof-of-concept. I'd
offer to share the .fvwm95rc and resources settings with you but the
machine I setup has been mothballed.

In the FvwmTaskBar module, when I run anything using the Start Menu, the
Start button stays pushed in. 

I read the FAQ in the distribution about this, but didnt really understand
how I can prevent this behaviour.

Thanks,
Vikas

yes to everything... If you are building something for public use (kiosk
or otherwise), you should go through all the configuration files and make
sure everything meets your needs. 

Here's an idea... make the default styles and decorations so that the
windows don't show up or something. Then create a seperate theme (style
group, etc) and add it rams to it.

Read the X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual (vol 4 in the
O'Reilly series).  Section 8.1 is on translation table syntax.

Any further questions should be to news:comp.windows.x.intrinsics
rather than this list.

I've just uploaded some fvwm2 RPMS/SRPM to Red Hat contrib which are
the same as the 5.1 RPM with a tiny patch to fix UseStyle which was
broken by the iconboxes patch that RH added.  This might fix your
problem.

This bug was in 5.0 and I sent this patch to them last December, but
it is very low on their priority list.

Using RH5.1 and fvwm2.0.46. The NumLock key is causing me some grief.

In Vim, when I turn on the NumLock key (LED is on), my mouse clicks no
longer work _with Vim_. i.e. the xterm no longer receives the mouse clicks.
When I turn off the NumLock LED, things work fine.

xmodmap -pke | fgrep -i numlock gave me

keycode 77 = NumLock Pointer_EnableKeys

xmodmap alone told me that NumLock was Mod2.

Aha! Seems the pointer and NumLock key are somehow related.

How do I get around this? 

xmodmap -e 'remove Mod2' will get rid of the modifier? Will my LED still
light up and can I use the digits on the numeric keypad? 

xmodmap -e 'keycode 77 = NumLock' will get rid of the pointer dependency?

Nothing seems to be working.

I am not sure, I am just grasping at straws here. Would appreciate a short
tutorial from some guru out there.

Thanks,
Vikas

P.S.
 The Pointer_EnableKeys is intriguing though. What does it do? Does it mean
I can control the pointer (mouse) with the keyboard? How does it work? How
can I re-bind it to some other key?

As far as I could tell, the NumLock/mouse click conflict appears to
be an issue with the fvwm95 window manager.  Try toggling CapsLock
or ScrollLock to see if they interfere in the same way.  On my system
running RH5.0 they did.  Since then I've moved on to other wm's which
thankfully don't seem to behave similarly.

I'm still curious as to the cause of this behavior (as I don't remember
it in previous fvwm incarnations).  I vaguely remember running into a
posting of some sort which explained it but I can't be sure and I
certainly don't remember what it might have said.

I've heard about someone working on making Fvwm2 'Gnome-compliant'. Does
anyone know of a home webpage for this development?

Hi,

Is there a way to get the window under the pointer to be focused on
command?  Because when I switch desktops with the Scroll command, the
windows that are focused are those on the previous desktop, because I
use ClickToFocus.  In order to focus on one of the windows that I see, I
need to take my hand off the keyboard and click the mouse, which is a
tad annoying.  I tried binding the Focus command to a key, but it just
focuses the currently selected window which is useless.  

If I type 'Focus' in the Talk window, it lets me control the round
pointer and then select the window I want to act upon.  Is there a way
to get the Focus command to behave in this way when hit a ALT-F1?


Thanks,
Raja

Try:
Key F1 A M Next [* CurrentDesk]Focus

Or even better, if you use a keyboard shortcut for changing desks
(we're talking desktops here, not pages, right?) you could make a
complex function like

AddToFunc "DesknFocus"		"I"	GotoDesk $0 $1
+						"I"	Prev [CurrentDesk] Raise
+						"I"	Prev [CurrentDesk] Focus

And bind it appropriately, feeding it two args, the desk x,y...

You might want to try something like

man fvwm2 and search for next to get the list of conditionals to use

(First, let me just say that yes, I've read FAQ #10.)

We've just installed fvwm2 as the default wm in the EE department and
are using the FvwmButtons module.

Our biggest problem is:

1) Win95 users who double-click the buttons and unintentionally end
   up having 2 applications running. 

2) Multiple invocations of a single application because some
   applications (netscape, matlab maple (symbolic math package)) take
   about 30 seconds to start-up; i.e. for the window to be mapped on
   the screen. Users click once, after 3 seconds nothing happens so
   they click again...and again...

So, basically, we need a solution to 1) prevent multiple applications
starting-up when the user clearly did not intend it. I thought about
playing with the double-click time, but this will interfere with
other things like de-iconifying. (Killing the students is not a
solution, their tution fees pay my salary.)

2) fvwm to give some indication that an application is starting until
the time when the window is mapped on the desktop.

I remember someone posting some fvwm2rc code with the buttons bound
to a function called Raise-Or-Exec which exec'd an app if it wasn't
already running otherwise raised the app-window. (I lost the post.)
Does someone have code that does this? It would alleviate the problem
somewhat.

The only suggestion I can offer is that having a timeout of xxx
seconds on a button would help; i.e. a new app will run only xxx
seconds *after* the button was last pressed. This can be implemented
via the XtAddTimeout() function. 

Perhaps, a "watch" cursor indicator when the mouse is on the
buttonbar would be nice (until the window has been mapped).

Please email me any suggestions you may have.

How about using a wrapper around the applications, which checks  if they are
already running in $MAXCOUNT instances, with maxcount an parameter
for the wrapperscript?

Vikas Agnihotri has StaysOnTop trouble:

> How is this resolved?  Can't 2 StaysOnTop windows peacefully co-exist?

Apparently not.

I think that all you can do is toy a bit with the goemetries of both, making
sure that they never overlap.

Hope this helps,

That is only because it is so difficult! If I only had the necessary
expressive power in fvwm2 itself, I wouldn't need extra modules=2E

fvwm2 and configuration languages, though at that time I was more in

I'm sorry about that, as feel exactly the oppercite way! As another

If anybody, like Eric S=2E Raymond, me and possibly others, like to
support some sort of merge between fvwm2 and scwm, then that is our
choice and not Maciej's or Gregs=2E

I can't talk for Eric or any other, but in my case I wanted to leave
fvwm anyway if it didn't include a new configuration languege very

Here we differ! Both modules are oneway creatures=2E They can not react
on the current configuration in anyway, just change it blindly=2E That
is, of cause (or if not "of cause", then seen in hindsight) enough for
most uses of fvwm until now=2E

I just believe that if we want to do more with fvwm, then we need a
full configuration language with access to all structures of
fvwm=2E=2E=2E And that is difficult, though not impossible, to do in a
module=2E We would have to extend the fvwm module protocol alot, and I
guess, we would end up with a fvwm the same size as if we just added
configuration language=2E

Looking back at the messages send by Maciej and Greg until now, I see
nothing to support the above paragraph=2E All they have done is to
express a desire to avoid duplicate work=2E Which is "good" in my

How do you get raised title bars on applications?  Right now, my .fvwm2rc 
shows this for titlestyle:

TitleStyle ActiveUp (VGradient 128 cyan3 white -- Raised)  ActiveDown 
(VGradient 128 cyan3 white) Inactive (VGradient 128 #c06077 white -- Raised)

(BTW, that's all *1* line!!)

Clues for the clueless, please.

I am trying to get my FvwmButtons buttons to un-depress when a window
appears.  But I can't find any way to do it.  Please let me know if I'm
overlooking something.

For many of my buttons, I don't just want to Exec.  I want to run a
function which does an Exec followed by a Focus and/or a WarpToWindow.
But it seems that I can't do that as well as getting the button to pop up
when the window appears.  The code I'm using is:

AddToFunc ExecAndFocus "I" Exec $0
+                      "I" Wait $1
+                      "I" Prev [$1] Focus
...
*FvwmButtons(Title Mail, Icon mail2.xpm, Action `Function ExecAndFocus
"xterm -g 80x30 -T Pine -n Pine -e pine -i" Pine`)

So here's my suggestion:  it would seem logical to make the first
(optional) parameter to Exec a separate option, so that it can be used
with other FVWM commands, like say adding a Wait option:

*FvwmButtons(Title Mail, Icon mail2.xpm, Action `Function ExecAndFocus
"xterm -g 80x30 -T Pine -n Pine -e pine -i" Pine`, Wait "Pine")


My second suggestion is to allow wildcards in the window name. At the
moment, I'm having to do this:

*FvwmButtons(Title "Netscape", Icon netscape3.xpm, Action `Exec "Netscape:
Version 4.04 [en]-97308" netscape`)

But my guess is that the window title will change the next time my system
administrator updates Netscape.  Why not this:?

*FvwmButtons(Title "Netscape", Icon netscape3.xpm, Action `Exec
"Netscape*" netscape`) 

(In fact the standard Wait command could do with that enhancement too.)

fvwm2 newbie here:


i am running fvwm2 2.0.46 on a redhat 5.0 linux intel system with the 
XFree86 version 3.3.1 server.

want to find out how to place the mouse cursor at an arbitrary
ABSOLUTE pixel coordinate in SCREEN, from the keyboard.    

for example, if an fvwm function named GoToPixelCoord x y
existed, then i could do a keybinding to 
GoToPixelCoord SCREEN_SIZE_X/2 SCREEN_SIZE_X/2 
to place cursor in screen center
and be happy as a clam.

alternatively, if there is a workaround thru X, that would be OK too.

thanks ! -josin

I have this in my .xinitrc
  xsetroot -cursor_name iron_cross

So I have the opposite of you. On the desktop I have the iron cross
but over some windows it's a normal cursor.
Guess I never paid attention to cursor settings in fvwm's config file.

I thought it might be fun to use custom cursors for some fwvm contexts
(window resize comes to mind, since I think the default cursors are
ugly). But CursorStyle can only load cursors from the cursor font. Any
ideas on how to use a custom cursor? So far I've come up with:

1) hack CursorStyle to accept a pair of bitmaps like xsetroot does
2) tweak the fvwm source to build different default cursors using
XCreateCursorFromPixmap or somesuch
3) hack up my cursor.pcf

None of these sounds particularly fun, especially since I'm really not
qualified for 1 or 2. Anyone have a 4) to suggest? I'm resisting 3)
because I'd really rather not start mucking with my cursor.pcf...

Just trying to find new and useless projects for myself.

Hi,

thanks a lot, now i am saticfied.
xsetroot -cursor_name hand2
works good for my for now :)
and also i discowered a bitmap program. It eeds aom efuther attention, i
will pay it to it :)

But, i played with the system.fvwmrc file like this

Desk 0 1
Exec netscape &
Wait netscape

Desk 0 2
Exec soffice &
Wait soffice

(of cousre not exactly as i provide them here)

and they ar not behaving like xterms would be in their place.
it seems they dislike the Wait.

Does this mean that i should upgrade to fvwm2 or i am just stupid or
both ?

        Check the man page for xsetroot, then look at cursorfont.h (wherever
your X11 includes live). xsetroot uses the names defined there (minus the
leading "XC_").

To change desktops using keys, try something like the following in your
~/.fvwmrc or system.fvwmrc :

into system.fvwmrc and alt 1,2,3,4 switch between Desks, and alt-tab
between windows. and i binded alt -5 to close a window.

But, somehow, on the console appears following error text:

fvwm: bad key function: Next in line Key Tab A       M       Next [*]
Focus
fvwm: bad key function: Prev in line Key Tab A       SM      Prev [*]

Focus
fvwm: bad key function: Prev in line Key Tab A       SM      Prev [*]
Focus

though bindings work ?

It is puzzling, isnt it?

Thanks all the same, now it is a lot comfortable to toil around :)
I promise not to bother you people for quite a some time.

Imre

PS

As you have perceived i am not a born english-speaker and in Estonia we
have a spell (or is it a curse) on our nation:

we have common letters like this:   - it is most probably
clutter on your screen :)

But the point is that somebody told me to experiment with keykodes with
the X-program xev - x event.

So i put following lines into my /var/X11R6/lib/xinit/.Xmodmap

keycode 22 = BackSpace
keycode 21 = grave
keycode 49 = asciitilde

(other definitons could be probaby found in
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h in my case - Slackware 3.4)

If you find it useful too, i am gled. My borrowed two cents, maybe,
maybe not.

And if somebody knows a place where to LEARN how an character is taken
from a keybouard and is put onto a screen (be it termnal or X terminal)
i would be most greatful. Just to try and err is human but .... sad.

Which version of Fvwm are you using? I don't get those error messages
on ver. 2.0.46

Thanks.

Hallo,

Having put down to address i think list is not an appropriate place for
this discussion anymore but, hey maybe somebody could drop in a line as
well.
Anyway,

bash# emacs -version
GNU Emacs 19.34.1

Strange, i need to downgrade :)

Really, i didnt expect to find out answers to my national settings
questions from US (?) people. My countrymates are sleeping already.
Probably tomorrow they answer me. But Today (night) it great anyway - i
got my linux Slackware box running at least more or less in a way i can
start seriously using it. Earleir it was not so much for than agenst :)

Best Regards, Imre Oolberg,

And as i found out from your http:// you teach computers. I gonna  do
it  in the fall. In a collage. And physics also, i hope. There could be
things i might like to ask you. Then, if you dont mind i write to you an
e-mail now and then. Sadly i dont have homepage  myself, at least not in
english; well, i do but there is not much to look at. Bad thing about it
is that one cold easily discover it in the net. And i forgot my
password. So it will just hang there until the end.

At the moment i am busy writing CGI -s for the someones homepage it is
also in english (vanamees.vaip.werro.ee ) just commerce but tecnically
challenging, at least for me, now).

My fvwm2 has been running for more than a week now and I have made many
'online' changes to it using the 'FvwmCommand' module. This is a great
module! Thanks to whoever wrote it. 

Now, the problem is that I dont know exactly what changes I did, but I like
my current config. Styles, Decors, misc stuff, etc.

Is there a way I can dump my current config to a fvwm2rc-style file so that
I can get the same config when I kill my fvwm2 sesssion and log in again. I
eventually _have_ to reboot my machine, you know! :-)

Thanks,
Vikas

Have a look at the FvwmSaveDesk and FvwmSave modules.

I have seen this reported several times in the mailing list archives, but
have not seen a
solution or fix posted.  I am running fvwm-2.0.46 on a Sun Ultra 5 running
Solaris 2.5.1
under CDE.  I have 2 (possibly related) problems.

1. The fvwm modules eat up all available CPU (as reported by "top").

2. When I exit (by running "/usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession"), fvwm exits,
but the modules
   live on.

Any assistance is appreciated.

What's the option that allows me to drag a window across
desktops just by dragging it. My fvwm2 use to it but now, if
I drag a window to the border of the desk, it stays there and
it doesn't shift to the other desk.

I figured it was a compile option since it works on AIX with
the same fvwm2rc file. The platform I have problems with is
a Solaris 2.6 box running fvwm-2.0.46.

Thanks.

The fix is a pipe handling correction posted (for 2.0.44) to the list by
Grant McDorman on or around Jan 21, 1997.  I will off-list mail Lindner
the 2.0.44 patch I have in hand (you might have to massage it a bit for
2.0.46).  Perhaps the adaptation to 2.0.46+ is in progress, anyway?  I
hope this solves the problem he is having.

Bzzt. Nope. This will save information about my X clients, etc to a
new.xinitrc-style. I want to save the configuration of the fvwm2 itself in
a .fvwm2rc -style file.  Get the difference?

What version of fvwm2 are you using on the AIX machine?  I've
noticed this same problem with version 2.0.46 with Linux,
Solaris and Irix, so I doubt that it's OS related.  Could be a compile
time option I guess, but I don't remember reading anything about it in
the release notes... 

Anyway, I hate having the desktop flip automatically when the mouse
is at the screen edge, but I like having the ability to drag windows
across desktops.  Anyway, I've been using 2.0.45 because of this.

Yup, we do. I can't say if that's possible today or not (I'd guess not),
but it's a really nice feature that I'd like added to the FVWM ToDo-list.=

Anyone have thoughts on how to accomplish this?

Things like that add tons of value for a lot of end-users.

Hi all!

I need urgent help from an fvwm2 insider, because the man pages could not 
help me :-(

What I need is a mapping between the Window ID and the corresponding PID(s) 
of the processes of this window. My concrete scenario: If I push a (new 
defined) button in the title bar of a window, I like to echo all the 
processes related to this window; e.g., if an MPEG-Player with PID 1142 is 
running in the window with the ID 0x20004, I would like to know how I can 
map the Window ID to the PID.

Thanks for helping me !!!

Hi my name is Sheila Mendoza, from Boeing in Huntington Beach, CA.
I work with Ted Ramsdell.

My boss has assigned me the task of making sure all of our COTS s/w that were
are using on our deliverable product is Y2K compliant.  I was wondering if you
could fax me a statement on the FVWM V1.24r that we are using saying that it IS
Y2K compliant, it IS NOT Y2K compliant, or it is N/A.   

You can fax this statement to 714-372-0572.  A e-mail message is not going to be
acceptable to our customer, according to my manager.  So if you could mail or
fax a statement that would be appreciated.

Cool, can anybody send you a FAX? Stupid managers... 

If it will make Ted happy, I am sure lots of the people on this public
domain (and supported) software list could FAX him a big "sure".

It is as Y2k compliant as your pencil.  Perhaps more so, even.

You're kidding, right?

You have the source: you can certainly look for any attempts in the code
to determine the date or manipulate and compare it in any way.

Her boss, Ted, wants someone to blame (and perhaps sue) if a free product
that they include in their perhaps profit-making delivable product IS NOT
Y2K compliant.  Random email is just not good enough.

Man, does the open-source community have to ways to go before the rest of
the world understands.

--

A few months ago, someone from our organisation called me up because I was
listed as a user of some software she had to make sure was Y2K compliant.
The software was TeX, and she inquired whether I had web links or hard
paper documentation that could show TeX to be Y2K compliant.  She was going
through an exhaustive list of software we happen to use.  Can you believe
that?

I suppose one shouldn't be too hard on Ms Mendoza, who at least has some
command of the English language (I note with approval the non-use of
the hideous "I have been tasked with ...").  Perhaps she can use those
same skills to convince her boss that requesting a compliance statement
about an open-source program is meaningless at best and idiotic at worst.

  Seriously, though... what if a 747 with FVWM2 installed in the cockpit

Dispite the Friday-humor, your point is well taken. Many of us have our own,
at times silly, Year-2000 policies. Not that y2k is not important, just the
policies that get written by the confused. Oh, well..

The upcoming FVWM-2 release should have a y2k seal. It should be tested
against the various y2k relevant dates on a computer that is y2k compliant.

Doing anything for FVWM V1.24r, however seems a little late in the game (in
my opinion). I just looked at my own source trees, and the oldest version I
have around is in fact, "FVWM V1.24r" with a date of "Jun 14 1995". It is
what is runnning on our non-y2k machines, that we will be replacing. However
the few places in the code where time is used are in "ctime" which is y2k
compliant. Your group should be able to verify it themselves though.

Fvwm-workers, Can we have a README.Y2K or similar for the official release?

It doesn't even need to be tested.  Try 'grep time' in your src directory
and see what fvwm does with times.  (Hint: the vast majority of references
are in comments like 'check this 3 times', the rest are timestamps of X
events or timeval's for select().)

[durin:~/fvwm-2.0.46/fvwm] 244 % grep ctime *.[ch]
[durin:~/fvwm-2.0.46/fvwm] 245 % 

I see no 'ctime'.  (or localtime or gmtime, for that matter.)

I deleted 1.24 long ago.

> Fvwm-workers, Can we have a README.Y2K or similar for the official release?

Use the one from http://language.perl.com/news/y2k.html, though that
assumes that there -is- an interface for getting the date: fvwm has no
such interface.

It is more Y2k-compliant than a piece of blank paper: Perl (and C and
every other language) is as compliant as a pencil.

I think feeding Y2k compliancy statements to the clueless is a Bad Thing
in that encourages them in thinking that if they send out enough mail to
everyone their system is safe instead of actually thinking about the
problems.

I think avoiding Boeing airplanes for a few days would be a better thing
in that if this is how they ascertain compliance, the planes -will- be
falling out of the sky.

If merely because (if the rate of progress over the past three years
has been any guide) it will be past the turn of the millennium by the
time fvwm2 comes out of beta :(

This has been sitting in my inbox for a while, so  I forget if someone
else gave an answer.

My own opinion is that the connection between processes and windows is
flexible enough that there is no way to make the connection.

Certainly, if the window is created from  a remote system, the PID may
not  even  exist.  (The  window  may  not even be   created  by a UNIX
system.)

Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="titlebar.jpg"

Can you make a window not appear in the FvwmPager? (FvwmButtons in
particular) Thanks, and apologies if I missed it in the docs.

I would like fvwm2 to play a waveform audio file and quit when the user
selects Quit FVWM from the pop-up utility menu.  I have written a shell
script called by fvwm that does not work.  After reading the man pages,
it looks like I need to define a shutdown function in fvwm2rc.  Can you
offer any help?

Thanks,

fvwm2 is called by either your .xsession or your .Xclients file.  Anything
you put in that file after fvwm2 should be executed when fvwm2 is exited.

Unable to reproduce this consistently, but many times fvwm2 simply freezes

Anyone else?

I don't know if this is the same thing, but after starting FVWM with
startx, once in a while, I just get the background screen, but with
everything frozen (no mouse movement).  The only way to get out of it is
to reboot the machine by powering off.  I can't kill the X-server.

Hasn't happened for a while.  I'm new to FVWM and linux, so I haven't
looked into it very much.

I'm running Slackware linux on a Pentium machine.

it doesn't sound like fvwm2 is hung, this is what your display would
look like with no window manager running.

Look for a core file.  If its an fvwm2 core file, obtain a stack trace
and post the stack trace to this list.

Thats what I thought too. I did look for a core file, but there wasnt any.
Any other ideas.

I have experienced hangups in starting X/fvwm2 on my Linux box, but they
are generally my fault.  I diagnose them by looking at the virtual
terminal output.  I am using ssh-agent to invoke xinit (bypassing startx
because I want to run with -auth options and it hasn't worked through the
std startx script; no I haven't done what the startx comments say
internally and rebuilt the script to fix my problems).

What I saw before I got my .Xauthority file set up correctly was a raft of
"can't connect to display" messages from fvwm as it tried to connect to
the display without the proper magic cookie codes.  Such errors don't
leave the mouse hung up, though.  It should be an interesting diagnostic
pointer, if someone's mouse is frozen.  I have had Netscape do (I think) a
server grab and freeze my X display for activities, but I can still move
the mouse.  I haven't disabled the Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace hotkey for killing
the X server, so I use that for getting out of this problem.  I can also
use the Shift-Alt-F? keys to get to the other virtual terminals on a Linux
system to try to determine what is happening if I can't tell from error
messages on the VC from which X was started. 

Hope this helps, but it isn't at all fvwm(2) specific.  Back to background
mode.....

I have put 

+ "I" FvwmCommandS

in my InitFunction as well as RestartFunction but when fvwm2 (.0.46) starts
up, the FvwmCommandS module is not started up. I either need to restart
fvwm2 or use the 'Modules' menu to start FvwmCommandS.

What is wrong?

Thanks,
Vikas

If you can start it during restart, or from a  menu, but not from your
init function, I think you should show us the whole InitFunction.

I had problems wih fvwm2 when I turned on XPM support; fvwm2 basically 
hates old versions of libXpm, and indicates its hatred by instantly
dumping core. The symptoms, though, are an X server that dies rather
than hanging around, but I suppose this depends on your xinitrc rather 
a lot.

        Er, FvwmCommandS is a module, not an Fvwm command. Try the command
"module FvwmCommandS" instead of just "FvwmCommandS" and I think you'll have
better luck.

        On second thought, my answer doesn't sound quite right. If I recall
correctly, if Fvwm doesn't recognize a command it falls back to looking for
a module of that name. So maybe Dan's right, we need to see the whole
InitFunction. (But give my suggestion a try anyway.)

        Do you get any error messages on the console at startup, like
squawking about the ModulePath or anything?

AddToFunc "InitFunction"    "I" Exec xsetroot -solid lightpink3
+                           "I" Exec xsetroot -cursor_name iron_cross

+                           "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0

AddToFunc "RestartFunction" "I" Exec xsetroot -solid lightpink3
+                           "I" Exec xsetroot -cursor_name iron_cross
+                           "I" Module FvwmAuto 500
+                           "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+                           "I" Module FvwmCommandS

Then towards the end of the .fvwm2rc file, I extend the function as
follows:

AddToFunc InitFunction	"I" Desk 0 0
+		"I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x45+2145+1 -name News
+		"I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x35+47+15 -name Email -iconic
+		"I" Exec xterm -geometry 81x44+2061+726 -name Pumbaa
+		"I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x27+2287+844 -name Pumbaa
+		"I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x44+6+4 -name Pumbaa
+		"I" Function Decorwin95
+		"I" Module FvwmCommandS

Does it matter that I am splitting the InitFunction definition? The other
commands in the InitFunction are fine. I do indeed get all my xterms and my
Win95 decor.

As I said, I also have the following modules menu. FvwmCommandS works fine
when I launch it from:

AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "Modules" Title
+ "Buttons"	 	Module FvwmButtons
+ "Clean-Up"		Module FvwmClean
+ "Task bar" 		Module FvwmTaskBar
+ "Identify"		Module FvwmIdent
+ "Save Desktop"	Module FvwmSaveDesk
+ "Pager"		Module FvwmPager 0 0
+ "Command Server"	Module FvwmCommandS

Hi everyone!


Does anybody know why does fvwm (version 2.0.46) remove the module
configuration options called "*format"? There's no problem with
"*Format" though. I noticed it with the FvwmIconMan (I hacked it a
little :-) ), the GetConfigLine returned the lines without the
"*format"s. So "*FvwmIconMan*format '%t'" becomes "*FvwmIconMan* '%t'".
Or is my config file wrong?
Thanks.

You can isolate the problem if you change your InitFunction to just one
line invoking FvwmCommandS.=20

Hello all,

   I've been looking at KillModule command for a couple of days now,
   without being able to have it do what I thought its purpose is.

   What do I want to do?

   Well ... say I spawn two FvwmButtons modules: fb1 fb2.
   Now say I want to kill fb2 *only* and leave fb1 "alive".

   How can this be accomplished without having to write
   a function which would kill both and then restart fb1?

   Any hints, ideas?

Patrick ...

I believe this will show up on the next TODO list.
At this time there doesn't seem to be any way to do this
other than changing the source code.

	Hmmm, mayhaps I'm doing something worng, but I've modified my
FvwmButtons module definition so that it is possible for me to have more
than one functioning buttonbar on screen at the same time (not that I do
this -- it is just possible). Now in my testing of the new buttonbar layout,
I often DID end up with both on screen simultaneously. To get rid of one or
the other (or both), I've just used the buttonbar 'kill' command -- clicked
on it on one of the buttonbars, the cursor would change shape, and then I'd
click again on any part of the offending buttonbar and whoof! it'd be gone.
(Alternatively the kill cmd found in the popup menu would do as well.) I'm
not familiar with the KillModule cmd.

   Well .. yes.  This does work.  But I want to be able to
   do this more dynamically.

   Picture this:
   I have a standard FvwmButtons module called fb1.  On this
   button set I have one button named "Servers" with a server
   icon on there.
   
   Clicking on this button will spawn a new FvwmButtons
   module named "fbServers" which will contain icons for
   each of our development servers and one button named
   "Close", or a button containing a "back arrow" icon.

   Clicking on the "back arrow" or "Close" button would
   kill that particular instance of the FvwmButtons module
   named "fbServers".

   In effect it would look like a sliding drawer of sort.

   See my point?

If you really do want to kill the fbServers module you could kill the
window rather than the module (Next [fbServers] Close).

But what you are describing sounds just like a subpanel in HP-VUE and
CDE. Have a look at FvwmCDE (can't remeber the URL, try the mailing list
archives).  If that can't do it you can fake it with two FvwmButtons as
you describe but there is no need to kill and restart the sliding
drawer, instead you could just iconify it and set style options so that
the icon doesn't appear. e.g.

Style fbServers Sticky, CirculateSkip, CirculateIconSkip, \
StaysOnTop, NoIcon, StartIconic

and a function like the following called from the button in fb1

AddToFunc Servers "I" Echo "Doing Servers"
+ "I" None [fbServers CirculateHit CirculateHitIcon] FvwmButtons
fbServers
+ "I" None [fbServers CirculateHit CirculateHitIcon] Wait fbServers
+ "I" Next [fbServers CirculateHit CirculateHitIcon] Iconify

This is from memory of a function I used to use when I was a sysadmin so
it may need tweaking 8-). It won't do the funky sliding in and out that
CDE does but that could be done by replacing the Iconify with a function
that tests for the existence of an iconified fbServers and branches to
do either (raise fb1, raise fbServers, deiconify fbServers, AnimatedMove
fbServers out) or (raise fb1, AnimatedMove fbServers in, iconify
fbServers) but you'll need fvwm2.0.46 with the AnimatedMove patch or
2.0.47

Cheers,
Tim.

I have 'FvwmPager 0 0' all by itself, not part of FvwmButtons in the lower
right corner of my screen.

Why am I unable to move the pager by click-dragging on the title? Something
special I need to do?

Thanks,

        Ok, I'm stumped! I tried duplicating your setup (including the 
pumbaa's, which show up in very strange places, given my desktop geometry!),
but I can't make FvwmCommandS fail to start up. It works just fine from
either the InitFunction or the RestartFunction (and no, it doesn't matter 
that the InitFunction definition is discontiguous).

        There may be something quirky about your Decorwin95 function - I
didn't even try to guess at what it might be doing.

        If you'd like, send me a copy (preferably as an attachment, not 
pasted inline) of your entire .fvwm2rc file, and I'll see if I can test it
this weekend on my system. (This is probably not of general interest to the
mailing list, so you should probably just send it to me, unless Dan or Toshi
express an interest in seeing it also.)

Most people have something like this in their .fvwm2rc:

Style "Fvwm*" NoTitle,Sticky,WindowListSkip

which would suppress the titlebar on the pager.
The pager has its own "title" which is not a titlebar.

You should be able to tell the difference.

I don't know of any reason why you wouldn't be able to move the pager
with its titlebar, if you told fvwm2 to assign one to the pager.

If you don't have a titlebar on the pager, you should be able to move it
a number of different ways.  My favorite:

# Button 2 with Meta (diamond), moves window: dje
Mouse 2         W       M       Move

(grin) Obviously not. I was mistaking the pager title for the title bar. I
gave Style FvwmPager Title and indeed got a title bar using which I was
able to click-drag move the pager.

Small problem with this recipe.

In a xterm, when I do this with my mouse anywhere in the window, the move
works fine, but when I release the mouse buttons (1+3 since I am using a 2
button mouse to simulate Button 2), the current primary selection gets
pasted into the xterm! 

I understand that it is happening because Mouse 2 in a xterm is mapped to
paste the current selection, but this is  certainly a unexpected side
effect and could be dangerous if I am running a curses-based application
that interprets the pasted characters as commands!

Comments?

Get a 3 button mouse,  or use button 1 or 3.

"Meta Button 2" should never be seen by the xterm. fvwm2 will not pass
the "Meta-button  2" onto the client.  Something  is wrong.  From this
distance, I can't tell if its your fingers, your X-window emulator, or
something else.

I just tested this using "xev".  Sure  enough, xev, sees Meta button 1
and 3,  but never sees  button 2.   It does  see the "meta"  key being
pressed and released, but button 2 is completely invisible to it.

Try the same (xev) with your 2 button mouse.  Notice if the underlying
application sees both the press and release events.

I tried the 'xev' and it sees the meta key being pressed and released. When
I press and hold down meta and click 1+3 (=2), it does see the press and
release events (for button 2). 

Since the move window is working, fvwm is seeing it. And since it acts on
it, my xterm client shouldnt see it, right? Unless fvwm is passing it
along. What is wrong here?

Thanks,

   Yes, it was mentioned that I was describing the FvwmWharf
   behavior by another reader.

   Two reasons I do not want to go that route:

      1. Too lazy to learn new syntax for the Wharf module
         and get it to look and feel like my FvwmButtons
         module.

      2. The KillModule command description I origionally
         gave was a generic one and the FvwmButtons example
         was just that; and example.

         One could extend the use of such a module to kill
         particular instances of *any* module.


   Note that I am not trying to be deficult and/or trying
   to push idea of development of such a command.  I was
   simply pondering if there was an elegant way for me to
   do what I wanted to do.

   A few work.arounds were suggested with:
   
      `ps blah | grep blah | cut blah | kill blah'

   command....which would obviously work fine, though
   carry with it quite a bit of overhead (execv processes
   and pipe stuff to one another, etc etc).

   Thanks all for their informative replies!
   I appreciate every comment I received!  :)

Its my understanding that if  fvwm2 passed on  the buttonpress, to the
application, it would be marked "synthetic" and you  would see that in
"xev".  I don't  believe fvwm2 does that under  any  condition.  Which
version of fvwm2 did you say you were using?  Any patches applied?
