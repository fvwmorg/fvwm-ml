I've tried to install fvwm, but I can't make it work.

I have a sun sparc station running som sunOS 4.0.3

I'v installed xpm and I *think* it installed successfuly. At least I've
got the files

/usr/lib/libXpm.a
/usr/lib/libXpm.so.4.7

...in place. 

Then I copied the files .xinitrc and .fvwmrc from the
"modules/FvwmSaveDesk/example/" directory (wisely saving a copy of the
old ones of course). The I stried  starting the whole thing using "xinit".

I get an error message looking like:

ld.so: libXpm.so.4: not found

Does anyone have an idea what's wrong

PS. I'm just a novice.

You need to run ldconfig whenever you install a new shared library - see
"man ldconfig".

On my SunOS 4.1 the man page says it is run periodically via cron, but
that's not the case on my system.

Hi all. 
Yesterday exiting fvwm I could read this errors in my console (repeated a 
lot of times, no idea how much, filled the console buffer):

[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 2, EventType: 28

The "more" is that till in this version there is some problem with timed
events.  
   AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "I" Raise 
   + "M" Move 
   + "D" RaiseLower
I think this is a known problem, but... for example if you have the 
standard "raise or move" bound to the title bar, and you click, 
wait the right bit, :-) , and hop, the windows got moved even if you 
have released the mouse button and follow you. 

Another one is: if you have set up
   EdgeScroll 100 100
   EdgeResistance 750 50 
   OpaqueMoveSize 40  
and you move a nice solid xterm rapidly from the botton (for exemple) to 
the top of screen, stooping mouse on the very top, you can get in a 
situation where your xterm is blocked halfway, and then "jump" to the 
mouse position. But the most surprising thing is that if you release the 
mouse when window is blocked, and move it in another part of the screen, 
the xterm when start moving "flash" in the mouse position and the finally 
go to its right place on top of the screen. 

And last, but I suspect it's an interaction with AutoRaise module:
suppose you have like me AutoRaise 2000 and follow mouse focus. Then,
put an xterm window partially overlaying another one , and when you
have your window raised, to the following: 
   Move mouse on the title of the underlying window
   type "exit" and return in it so that you exit just when window
        is raised
   You now have the mouse pointer converted to a dot waiting (I
suppose) raising some target (I suppose because it is not simple to
get the timing right... but it happens now and when). 


Well, fvwm is I think the better WM around the world, fast and nice
looking. I hope this can help to spot the last bugs in it... keep with 
the fantastic work!

Bye,
     Romano.

I have to ask one very basic question before I apply the OpenLook patch to
the last release of Fvwm2...how do I apply a patch!?

More specifically, what program (called patch I presume) do I need, where may
I get a copy (UK/Europe preferred), and how should I go about using it?

I apologise for the rather ignorant nature of my question, but in the past I
have always just ignored patches and hoped the next release was soon.

And secondly, has anyone applied this patch and does it solve MailTool's
irritating behaviour of opening new mail as an icon provided the inbox
was otherwise empty (except on the first invocation of the day)?

With a bit of luck this patch or Solaris 2.5 might solve this, the only
serious problem I have. On that note I remember seeing a post about how some
definitions in Solaris 2.5 conflict with those of Fvwm (M_THINGS? something             
similar), has this problem been rectified? Our site is changing over soon and
I'd like to still use Fvwm with as little fuss as possible.

Thanks for any help.

Thanks for this info.  This made is easier to find in the code.

I applied a quick hack to always have the move/size window in the UL corner.
In case anyone is interested, in fvwm/fvwm.c, line 385:  (2.0.39)

  {
    Scr.SizeWindow = XCreateWindow (dpy, Scr.Root,
    /* patch by A.Spiegl to get move/resize box in UL corner */
/*                                    Scr.MyDisplayWidth/2 - 
                                    (Scr.SizeStringWidth +
                                     SIZE_HINDENT*2)/2,
                                    Scr.MyDisplayHeight/2 -
                                    (Scr.StdFont.height + 
                                     SIZE_VINDENT*2)/2,
*/
                                    0, 0,
                                    (unsigned int)(Scr.SizeStringWidth +
                                                   SIZE_HINDENT*2),
                                    (unsigned int) (Scr.StdFont.height +
                                                    SIZE_VINDENT*2),
                                    (unsigned int) 0, 0,
                                    (unsigned int) CopyFromParent,

                                    valuemask, &attributes);
  }

Simple, but effective.  :-)
Maybe, a somewhat more sophisticated way to configure this could
be incorporated in one of the next releases.

Larry Wall's patch program is fantastic; no site should be without it.
It's now distributed by the GNU folks, so look in:

  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/patch-2.1.tar.gz

(or its mirrors).  Like almost all GNU software, it's trivial to build:

  $ <unzip, untar, cd to directory>
  $ ./configure
  $ make intall

Bam.  Check out the INSTALL file for details.

Then, save your email or whatever containing the patch to a file and
send it to patch via stdin:

  $ patch < patchfile

Or, if you emailer supports piping messages to commands, you can invoke
it directly from there.

Patch is smart enough to ignore all "non-patch" text, like email
headers, comments by the author, etc.  I've never had to trim out any
junk (including .sigs) from a patch before using it.

Check out the man pages, they're very informative.  Have fun!

PS.  To make a patch, just run diff (preferably "diff -c" or "diff -u")

Acutally, I prefer the unified diffs ('-u') since I've had better luck
with them, and they seem to be smaller.

Due to this thread, I'm going to put info about how to 'properly'
submit and apply patches in the FAQ and BUGS files for the next
distribution.

I agree 1000%, and they're definitely smaller (because the context lines
are repeated only once instead of twice), but note that some 'Net
notables, in particular RMS, won't accept "diff -u" patches (actually he
accepts them, but he always requests that you use "diff -c").  They
claim it's harder for them to understand.  I find it _easier_, but YMMV
of course.

This is somthing I have been curious about for some time and finally 
decided to ask:
	What purposes do the M4 & CPP pre-processor modules serve?? Since 
I have never used them and don't know anyone who does I haven't been able 
to ask....What do they allow you to do that can't be done w/o them??
	TIA...

I've been on this list for a while, but it wasn't until recently that I 
had a chance to browse through the menu and explore some of the 
capabilities of fvwm.  Before fvwm I've been using ctwm for a long time 
(still missing some of its features, but I'll make a separate message
for that).  One capability in ctwm that I haven't found (at least no
mention of it in the menu) is the ability to move a window "in place"
from one desktop/screen to another.  By this I mean the window will snap
to the same position it had in the previous desktop/screen.  Because
using the pager I often place the window in unsatisfactory places (off
screen, to the side, etc.).  If this feature already exists I'm sorry
for taking up your time.

P.S. Chuck, there's no section for the Pager command in the menu, could
you add one for the next release?  I agree that for a general public
release it's as important to keep the doc uptodate as new features, new
features won't be too useful if people don't know they exist.

The ablility to do cool stuff as shown below. You could also 
use it to have the same file behave differently on different 
machines (with #ifdef's), #include different colors based on the 
day of the week, or whatever else you can think of.

If you make the window Sticky, it will stay in place as you switch
pages or desks, then you make it UnSticky again, and it will stay
there.  And the function WindowsDesk will move the window to a new
desktop directly.

I'm not sure what you mean there.  The sample rc file included
certainly does need beefing up (I plan to do that for the next release
as yet another prelude to officially releasing it) but it does
currently reference the pager in several places:

Since so many people here seem to request the ability to simulate
mouse events using the keyboard, I thought I'd point out that this
is possible using the XKB extension in X11R6.1.  The events get
generated in the server as real events, not synthetic.

If you are using XFree86, go to your favorite ftp.XFree86.org
mirror and get 3.1.2D.  If you're using some other platform, you'll
have to wait until the X consortium releases 6.1 to the public
(or until your vendor ships a 6.1 based server).

Some small patches to FvwmIconBox can be found at
  http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html

I was unable to find Nobutaka Suzuki at the address on the man page,
does anyone know who is maintaining FvwmIconBox now? Chuck?

Anyway, here's the contents of the patch:

  1) Adds "*FvwmIconBoxMargins number" for changing the width of margins 
     to number, where default was hardcoded to 6.
 
  2) Adds "*FvwmIconBoxFont None" which specifies that no font will be used,
     thus there will be no bars below the icons.
 
  3) Makes the window gracefully be resized to unexpected sizes, and not just
     make a mess out of itself like before.
 
  4) Makes the dragging of scrollbars more intuitive and standard.
 
  5) Documents 1) and 2) on the man page.

Enjoy,
-Jarl

Here is a small patch for fvwm-2.0.41 to fix following problems. Most
of these are already reported to this list.

* System configulation file name is not valid.
	system.fvwmrc/Imakefile should check 'FvwmRc'.
* Filename of fvwm-itself/fvwm-config-file may have leading space.
	Fix Fvwm.Tmpl to avoid.
* SmartPlacement style should become more smart.
	It should check 'where desktop the window is in'.
	(This patch is made by Nobutaka Suzuki)
* Function names are conflicts in FvwmForm module.
	Rename CopyString() to CopyStringN().
* Remove FvwmPrompt-lated stuff.
	Remove FvwmPrompt line from system.fvwmrc.

I hope it'll be included to the next release (2.0.42?).

It's totally awesome! And it works! 
Thank you Andrew Veliath!
But, there are some new features that must be added in order to make it
even better:

1) You should be able to specify different pixmaps for buttons of active
and inactive windows like this:
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap activeUp.xpm activeDown.xpm inactiveUp.xpm
inactiveDown.xpm

2) You should be able to specify pixmaps for titlebar backgrounds. This
one may be a bit tougher to implement, but it would be worth it!
The expression could be something like this:
TitleStyle Pixmap activeTitlebg.xpm inactiveTitlebg.xpm

3) The height of the titlebar should optionally be able to be specified
in fvwm2rc. This would help fitting the pixmaps without changing the
title font.

Something that I want done, is the use of different pixmaps for different 
widows (rather like OS/2) so that Xterm can have a teeny-tiny little 
xterm icon. The way I propose to do this is write a scaling function that 
takes the defined icon for this window and puts it into the corner. I 
would be happy to write such a scaling function, but I don't have the 
time to merge it with FVWM once I have written it. So if there are any 
people who are interested in this I can provide a function that scales a 
nxm set of data to a ixj, while the other intersted party can put it in 
the FVWM sources. The trouble for me is that I don't have the time to 
learn the FVWM sources.

The way that I propse to implement this is make it a compile time option 
to make button #n's default action is to display the correct scaled icon. 
Naturaly this could be changed at run-time in the usual way. I suggect 
this so we don't have to add any more elements to any FVWM structs.

Any takers?

Ian

That is an EXCELLENT idea.  I've wanted to suggest that, but I don't like 
suggesting things that I can't help out  with in least way.  

Could you extend that to work with FVWM's menus?  That way Icons can be 
defined once, and they'd appear:  when the window is iconified, next to it's 
name in the menu, and in the window itself.  This would remove so much 
extraneous work when adding pixmaps to menus.

Thanks for considering it,
Eric.

veliaa> It is a patch to allow one to put a pixmap file on an Fvwm

My friend mentioned to me that there is a bug(?) in locating
pixmap. Here is a patch to fix. I made this patch of course but
debugging is done by my friends, so I don't know what is fixed :-)

...you must be getting tired by now. So I'll wait a while before going on.
After all, you people got to get settled enough to start sending bug reports
and/xor praise. 

So what is new in this FvwmButtons since v2.0.41? Where to start? The big
thing I guess is that you can put several buttons inside common frames, you
can bind commands to seperate mouse buttons, simpler to divide buttons,
lesser memory footprint (I think), can use multiple fonts, can swallow old
windows on startup and unswallow them on exit, survives childrens crashes,
can even respawn the program that died. And so on.

For an example of how it can look, point your hypertext eaters at 
  
  http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html

where you can also get my distribution of FvwmButtons, and a couple of
patches, for fvwm-v2.0.41 and FvwmIconBox-v0.63. 

If you decide to try it out (please do!) and like it, or not, or just find
it to crash too much, or lack some features - MAIL ME! Sure, I'm doing this
for myself, but it would be nice to hear from someone who has glimpsed at it
before I completely lose momentum here... Hrm.. I can feel it happening!? ;-)

Enough talk, go on and have a peek at the page. If you're hypertextually
challenged, mail me, and I'll send you everything through the pipes.

Vyrdsamt,  (Andy: This Norwegian/Norse word means ~ "Respectfully" :-) )

Hi,

>	What purposes do the M4 & CPP pre-processor modules serve?? Since 

I use m4 extensively in my .fvwmrc files.  By keying on `hostname` I can use
the same file for multiple machines.  This is useful for NFS mounted
filesystems as all machines will use the same rc file.  I use m4 macros
to run unix commands, using the results for various things such as 
retrieving my logname, etc.

I use this to allow me to jump about pages with the arrow keys:

# Use arrow keys on root window to move about pages on virtual desk.
Key Left        R       N       Scroll -100 0
Key Right       R       N       Scroll 100 0
Key Up          R       N       Scroll 0 -100
Key Down        R       N       Scroll 0 100


Unfortunately if, by accident, I set Num_lock to on this doesn't work.
I don't use the keypad but brush against it quite often while using the
mouse or reaching for the radio etc etc, so how can I get this to ignore
the value of Num_lock?

I have just recompiled fvwm-2.0.41 with the OpenLook support
patch from Andrew Taylor.

Making and installing fvwm is now much easier, especially for a 
non root user, no more mucking around looking for DESTDIR in
Makefiles etc. Much better.

This second observation has more to do with the patch -
Sun's MailTool still doesn't work properly! 
When mail arrives in an empty inbox (as is usual) the
new mail, when clicked on, comes up in an icon, not as
a window. This does not happen the first time.

Mmm, not sure that that sentence is very clear, I know
this is a well known problem but still...here's a 
summary:

Log in
Start mailtool
Mail arrives
Open mailtool, double click on mail
	Read Message pops up. Fine.
	Scrap or save mail.
	Click 'Done'
New Mail arrives
Open mailtool, double clock on mail
	Read Message pane appears as an icon.
	Very irritating.
Mailtool continues to (not) work in this manner.


The appearance of textedit icons and others is much improved but a patch
or module to handle mailtool's behaviour and/or push-pins would be 
superb for the majority of Sun users.

Any help appreciated, failing that I might have to succumb to using another
X mailer, and I haven't found a decent one yet.

Insert an _additional_ set of Key definitions but with the modifier for 
your Num_Lock key.  On my Sun Solaris machine, they would be:

Key Left        R       3       Scroll -100 0
Key Right       R       3       Scroll 100 0 
Key Up          R       3       Scroll 0 -100
Key Down        R       3       Scroll 0 100 

because Num_Lock is assigned to mod3.  I haven't tried this, but it should
work.  Type xmodmap in an xterm window and you should see which modifier
Num_Lock is assigned to for your machine.

        xmodmap -e 'clear lock'         # disable caps lock key

but for numlock
or define the keys both with & without numlock modifier (mod? - get from
xev)

Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand,

Hi,

I was wondering if it is possible to have popup menus gounded to a certain 
area of the screen?  I like to call up my Utilities menu via the keyboard, and 
it would be nice to know where it's going to popup without having to find the 
mouse pointer.

Thanks,
Eric.

Interesting idea, this works:

Key F25      A N Popupat Window-Ops

AddToFunc Popupat "I" CursorMove -1000 -1000
+	          "I" Popup Window-Ops

The cursor move  values are expressed in percent  of pages.  by  Using
-1000, -1000 I am trying to get to the upper left  side of the screen.
A quick test showed me, that it doesn't seem to cross pages they way I
would have thought it  would.  If you  didn't want to  go to 0,0,  you
could move to -1000, -1000, and then move from there.

I imagine something like this could stop working in a future release.

Just installed   fvwm2.   It went smoothly   with the  following minor
problems:

1) I   didn't see any  mention   of needing  to   make  to the  target
"install.man".  I had the impression from  the INSTALL file that "make
install" would have installed the man pages.

2) The "fvwm_audio" directory seems to be missing.

3) I think everything that a run-time user would need to access should
be installed.   I  would like to  see the  audio and  icon directories
installed.

Dan,

Thank you. . . once again.  

The only time this causes a problem is when my mouse pointer is on the edge of 
my desktop -- then it moves me to the next desktop, and then pops up the menu. 
 So far I've had to *try* to create this behavior. . . so I'll take my chances.

Thanks again.
Eric.

Seems there was a serious bug left in FvwmButtons-020396 which made it 
choke on most button configurations. New version which should be fairly
stable is made available at the same place

  http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/fvwm.html

Seems that page is finally seeing some hits :-) So I put up a nice large
example with some menus and stuff. Enjoy.

Thanks for the feedback and fixes, as they speed things up ;-) !  Sorry for
the late response as well since I've had a busy spell lately ;-(.

This shouldn't be very difficult, I'll implement it in the next version.

This shouldn't be too bad to try; the only question is how to layout
the pixmap to account for any horizontal size.  My first guess would
be to just repeat the pixmap horizontally (which would,
however,facilitate the need of a "seamless" horizontal pixmap).  One
might opt alternatively to use a single centered pixmap.

I think the best way to handle the TitleStyle however would be to give
a modifier of /which/ type of window as you've mentioned, and to make
it simple something similar to one per line, such as:

TitleStyle <Active | Inactive | Sticky> <Simple | <Pixmap <Up Pixmap> [Down Pixmap] > >

I have break next week and will implement a test of this since for no
other reason than it seems neat.  Also, the title style declaration
could possibly include a text justification specifier.  A "down" title
pixmap should probably also be optionally specified in the same manner
as the button pixmap.

This is an interesting idea as well.  Ian also mentioned making the
button a reduced version of the currently assigned icon.  I think this
could just be an added button style, such as "ButtonStyle 1 UseIcon"
or something along those lines (?).  Someone mentioned they had code
to reduce pixmaps (hint, hint... ;) -- within the PixmapButton
framework it should be almost straitforward.  I was also thinking it
would be nice to be able to override the global button assignment from
the window Style declaration...  All of these things should naturally
be [preprocessor] optional.

I will make a web page available next week with some more
info and the latest implementation of the patch.  Again, thanks.

Sincerely,

Andrew Veliath <veliaa@rpi.edu>

Hello everyone.

I seem to have problems building Fvwm2.  Gcc gives me errors like:

	 "<somefile>.o(.text+0x1c6): undefined reference to `XpmReadFileToPixmap'"

The FAQ says that this error means that I don't have Xpm installed on my machine.  I believe I do have the it
installed because I have files in my /usr/X11R6/lib:

	libXpm.a
	libXpm.sa
	libXpm.so
	libXpm.so.4
	libXpm.so.4.3
	libXpm.so.4.7

I think these are the file I need but for some reason it doesn't work.  But when I change the "HasXpm" option in
the Fvwm.tmpl to 'NO' then when I compile, not only do I get the the error that I mentioned above, but I get
another also:

	"<somefile>.o(.text+0x1bf6): undefined reference to `PixmapPath'"

Has anyone had this problem or know what my problem is?  I'm open to any and all suggestions.
I'm confused since Fvwm1.24 has color icons and runs just fine on my machine now.

Thanks in advance.

Denoid.

P.S.

I'm running X11R6 on top of 1.3.20.

Just a few ideas comments. 
If this little algorithm for resizing pixmaps works could we have a
standardized size for pixmaps say 32x32 or 50x50(to provide some
detail). Also is it possible to use one pixmap as the background to
another to give that NeXT look?

Secondly a little idea for my win95 obsessed workmates; I reckon that it
would be relatively simple to write a module(a modified GoodStuff) that 
emulates win95 shortcuts. I'm going to try it myself but since I have to
write up my project soon, I may have little time. I think all that is needed
is a module to write icons to the screen and accept 1 or 2(perhaps 3) button
inputs. the button 2 would be for editing the config of the module.

if any xpm gurus out there like this idea and think that it is easy to
do, have a go at it. I think it is one way of getting windows people
away from microsoft and on to a proper open operating system.

I believe that CCLINK is only available under X11R6.  I'll see about
adding it for X11R6 only for the next version.

Although, I had no troubles linking it as it is under my Linux box at
home...

As in, force us to use only 32x32 or 50x50 pixmaps?  Please don't!

Why not just set up all your pixmaps to be of one size, and stick
with that?  I'm not clear why we should "standardize"...  Resized
pixmaps rarely look as good as the original, so I'd much prefer to
just add extra border around the edges of anything that's too small.

This new version appears to be sound.  Nice work!

Two caveats though:

  1. the new code relies on an XPM feature that is new with version 3.4g
     (the latest is 3.4h).  I was quite happily building fvwm with 3.4f
     before these changes came along.  I've upgraded now and everything
     is cool.

  2. the new code handles the search for bitmaps/pixmaps slightly differently.
     In some respects it's better because it now tells you when it encounters
     errors but the outcome of this for me was two-fold

       A. I had the same directory in my PixmapPath and my IconPath.  Before
          the code would fail to read a xpm file as a bitmap but would then
          try again and succeed to read it as a pixmap.  The new code stops
          at the first failure.  I simply changed by IconPath so that it
          didn't clash with my PixmapPath

       B. the "whatever" mode for selecting no icon now gives an error
          message (before it was just silently ignored).  I just changed
          my entries to use "-" when I don't want a pixmap which is what
          the new manual tells you to do.

Now, there's one more feature that I would really like to see;  I'd like
to be able to set up a button that would, given a window name,
start the program and wait for the window to come up (like the default)
unless a window with that name already existed in which case it would
warp the desktop to that window.

As an example, I'd like my FrameMaker button to only ever start one copy - if
I press it and FrameMaker is already running, it should just change to the
desk that it's on.

Oh yeah, another one;  It'd be nice if the button depressing had a timeout
value which would cause it to pop back up even though the window it was
looking for didn't come up.

Other than that, I'm happy with what it does.  I'm gonna rearrange my
buttons now to make them look cool....

RTFM.  You should be able to this now via a function and the 'None'
directive.  The example that shows this in fvwm2.man:

       AddToFunc MailFunction     "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
       +                          "I" Next [$0] focus
       +                          "I" None [$0] Exec $0 $1

The 'None' line says only do this if no window matching $0 exists.
You should be able to use something like this with FrameMaker.

Yes, but if I use such a function as a button-box command, it won't
do the button depressing stuff because it only looks for "Exec"
commands.  I don't think there's a general solution to this problem
short of adding support into the button-box module.

You can do this with an fvwm function.  I defined

AddToFunc warp-or-run "I" Next [$0 CirculateHit] Iconify -1
+ "I" Next [$0 CirculateHit] Focus
+ "I" None [$0] $1

And as part of my main menu definition I have:

+ "&Emacs" Function warp-or-run Emacs "Exec xcmd emacs"
+ "&Netscape" Function warp-or-run Netscape "Exec xcmd netscape"

I just tried it (with the standard FvwmButtons) and it works there.  I
haven't had a chance to build Jarl's FvwmButtons yet, but from the
docs it looks like it should work there as well.

G'day Fvwm'ers quick question for ya's,

We run fvwm(version 1.24r) in a DEC labs (and have been for the past 3
years). I am finally getting around to putting fvwm2 in our labs...
problem is how can I setup a global ".fvwmrc". With fvwm1, I could define
a "system.fvwmrc" which was read if a users' $HOME/.fvwmrc was not found.
fvwm2 doesn't seem to let me do this?  I have tried playing with the
Xsession script so it does something like: 

 if ($HOME/.fvwmrc exists) then
    exec fvwm
 else
    exec fvwm -f /apps/fvwm/system.fvwmrc
 endif

But I think I'm getting the syntax wrong for telling fvwm to use another
fvwmrc file. 

I could certainly hardcode the location of the system.fvwmrc file, but I
want to let student setup their own .fvwmrc if they want. 

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks to Bob and Chuck for the helpful hints.  Actually I was aware of
the WindowDesk function to move windows around.  But I was hoping to
achieve the desired effect by dragging the window in the pager, so I
guess my original request was directly more at the pager rather than
fvwm itself.  The ability to move windows in place would be a nice
addition to the pager, if I knew more about Xlib hacking I'd probably 
take a stab at it myself, but alas, I'm still at the Hello World stage
with even Xt/Motif, so it's probably going to be a while (like in the
next century) before I can produce something up to the usual high-
quality of fvwm.  But I still want to throw out these ideas, maybe 
someone will find them interesting enough to hack on:

1) define a *FvwmPagerMoveWindowInPlace option that will take the
options none, screen, desktop, none means the window will not snap to
the same location when dragged to a new screen/desktop, this should be
the default for compatibility.  The screen and desktop option can be
specified independently or in combination to cause windows to snap to
the same location when dragged to a different screen/desktop.

2) along with the above option we should probably specify a modifier key
to toggle the move behavior dynamically, if the old behavior is the
default then maybe we can define shift-button1 to move windows in place.
(This is the strategy used in ctwm, BTW)

3) another feature I'd like to see in the pager would be using pixmaps
as pager backgrounds, say *FvwmPagerPixmap 0 background1.xpm to put a
pixmap in the background of desktop 0, and so.  Maybe combine this with
*FvwmPagerLabel and merge into a *FvwmPagerStyle option that lets you
specify different style options for desktops.

4) the miniature windows in the pager can be drawn with 3D borders to
make them look nicer.

5) draw the individual desktop/screen as push-buttons like CDE (I think
this is already mentioned in the TO-DO list).

All of the above ideas come from my experience with ctwm, sorry to keep
bring it up, but it's my only frame of reference.  I certainly don't
want fvwm to try to emulate every feature and bahavior of other window
managers, but we can take the good parts from other systems to make fvwm
even better.  In keeping with the Unix/freeware philosophy, if you want
something done, do it yourself.  So I plan to make these my projects,
unless someone gets to them before I do, in which case I would be even
happier.

Sorry for that confusing comment, I was referring to the internal pager
in fvwm 1.xx which is gone in 2.xx, I've since upgraded to 2.0.41 and
read the man pages on the pager.  My above suggestions still apply.  I
don't think the pager module change that much going from 1.xx to 2.xx.

I'm experiencing a few quicks in 2.0.41 but I'll send out a separate
message for that, this one is getting long.

Thank you all for the reports on the latest FvwmButtons. There seems to be
two major inconveniences right now, that should be fixed:

 * If bitmaps and pixmaps are kept together in the same directory, FvwmButtons
   fails to load the pixmaps. This is a bug which was easily fixed.

 * As Olly and several others point out, the routine for allocating colors
   via xpm only works for xpm-3.4g and higher. (I didn't know that, sorry.)
   Now, I will try to fix that, but I meet the following problem: xpm.h defines
   it's version etc as:
     #define XpmFormat 3
     #define XpmVersion 4
     #define XpmRevision 7
   Forgive me for asking, but how can I use these defines to decide whether 
   to compile a part of the code or not? Most preprocessors will only handle
   constant expressions. 
   So, for now I have put a #define NEWXPM in the beginning of FvwmButtons.c.
   There is another way of doing what I do in the new code, but that is
   defined as obsolete by the latest xpm docs... Help? Anyone?

A new snapshot of FvwmButtons with these fixed will appear on the web page 
later today.

Other comments:

 * Olly:

   I really considered this a feature, besides, with the new syntax it 
   should not be a problem, as all you do is leave out the "Icon xxx" part.
   The new syntax is where everything is done inside the ()'s, and nothing
   outside.

 * Olly:

   Ok, I've put it on the TODO list, but it'll take a while, sorry...

 * Robert Tarrall discovered a serious typo which would mess things up if
   you have buttons with actions "Desk ....". (Does anyone use that anymore?
   Guess the pager has taken over, but you know - never, _ever_ remove a
   feature!) Should have shown up in my compiler warnings, however this lousy
   system doesn't have matching includes and libs, I have to use things like 
   sscanf and fprintf on faith. Looking forward to return to my Linux PC :-).

More stuff:

Even though I really, _really_ should be doing something completely different,
it seems I can't get my mind of this :-)
I have everything laid out, on paper, to redo the parser, make the button box
interactively configurable (you'll love that), and some more options.
I will do some brushing up, there will be some changes to the extended syntax
to make it all set, and then I will freeze it for some months.
(Until then, daily snapshots will appear on the web page. If you make a nice
config, please send it to me if you want it included there :-) Instant fame!)

Problem is I've got 3 weeks now to finish my diploma, one week holiday with my
family, and then 2 months intensive army training probably without much spare
time.

But I promise to finish this some time, I mean, there is a limit to how many
features you can add. Isn't it..?

Vyrdsamt,

My experience with FVWM 2 is that it looks for a central file named .fvwmrc
or .fvwm2rc (depending on your compilation set-up) in the directory were the
modules are located, e.g. in your case in /apps/fvwm/  . I used a link pointing
to the place were I store our central system.fvwmrc file. To override the 
central file each user just adds ~/.fvwmrc or ~/.fvwm2rc (the name depends on 
the compilation set-up).

I'am running FVWM 2.0.39 on SUN Sparc Solaris 1 with Openwindows 3.0 used
as X-server and have my modules installed in /usr/openwin/lib/fvwm2 with a 
link fvwm in /usr/openwin/lib/ pointing to fvwm2. I'm not 100% sure wether this 
link is required or not. I don't think it's important for me to find out as 
long as it works.

I hope this can be of any help to you.

Heh, sorry for that one, must have skipped a few lines on the man page :-(
  #if XpmFormat >= 3 && XpmVersion >= 4 && XpmRevision >= 6
should work fine everywhere, not?

I have specified that I want fvwm to use the file $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc. I supposed that this will mean that fvwm will search for /....fvwmdirectory.../.fvwm/fvwmrc

however I want to read in files whihc are in .fvwm. To do this I've had to use the command   Read .fvwm/whatever

I would like fvwm to look in $HOME/.fvwm as default as this is where I've specified that the config is resident, so that I just type

Read whatever

is this a minor fix? and if so, could it be done.

perhaps you could define in Fvwm.tmpl the directory for fvwmrc as well as the file name?

thanks

Hi Guys n Gals,

I've just switched to fvwm 2.0.41 and it's just great, but I've got
just one question (which may simply be due to a lack of
documentation).

Is it possible to warp the pointer to the center/top/bottom/left/right
of the window with the focus?

I've got everything set up very nicely to work via the keyboard and
with the mouse, but when rezising via the keyboard, it is a hassel
having to get the mouse pointer in the right position first. (Normally
the mouse is in the top left corner, from the last "Next [] focus"
call.

I'ld like a function that works something like this:

AddToFunc Resize	"I" WarpCenter
+			"ML" AttatchLeft
+			"MR" AttatchRight
+			"MU" AttatchUp
+			"MD" AttatchDown
+			"M" Resize

So with the first motion, the cursor attatches itself with one or two
sides (ei: Top Left) and any following motions then resize, with the
unattached sides being anchored, and the attatched side(s) moving.

Any hints?

Thanks in advance,

Steve

Hi!

I really like FVWM2, but there are some features, that exist in olvwm, that I
would like to see in fvwm2 too.

1.  A zooming effect, every time a window is iconified for de-iconified (i.e.
in Mac Finder or olwm)
2. What I like about the olvwm's virtual desktop is that you can drag a window
from the desktop and drop it over the virtual desktop manager, thus moving it
to another desktop

Are there any plans/patches etc or do I only have to RTFM.

Markus

Just slightly:

               fvwm -f "Read /apps/fvwm/system.fvwmrc"

I think I have to specify this in the docs a little better.

Understandable.

Just a note here, I *HIGHLY* recommend keeping the defaults to be
fvwm2 for the exec and .fvwm2rc for the rc file, since fvwm will
probably coredump if it reads an rc file meant for 1.xx.  Plus that
way you can keep both of them installed on your system, in case
someone is more than happy using 1.xx.

jeb> compilation set-up).

That just about sums it up.  From the man page (as of 2.0.41):

     INITIALIZATION
          During initialization, fvwm will search for a configuration
          file which describes key and button bindings, and a few
          other things.  The format of these files will be described
          later.  First, fvwm will search for a file named .fvwm2rc
          (or .fvwmrc based on how it was compiled - .fvwm2rc is the
          default) in the users home directory.  Failing that, it will
          look for /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/.fvwm2rc for system-wide
          defaults.  If that file is not found, fvwm will be basically
          useless.

This is only slightly wrong.  /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/ will actually be
whatever you set FvwmDir set to in the Fvwm.tmpl file, or most likely
something like the above ($LIBDIR/fvwm2) if you don't have it set.

Also, I'm going to try and put more basic defaults hard coded into
fvwm's init process, to help nullify that last line about it being
useless without a config file...

jeb> I'am running FVWM 2.0.39 ...

You may want to pick up 2.0.41 as it fixes some bugs and should be
slightly faster at reading the rc file and processing events, plus has
improved docs and install process.

Of course.

This will most likely never happen.  Adding too many 'cute' effects
like this will only serve to bloat and slow down fvwm, which is
something that I am trying really hard to avoid.

And I don't know if this would be possible via a module (I think not),
which would be my typical response after I make a statement like
that...

I don't think that this will be possible in the current setup.  The
pager in 2.xx is no longer built into fvwm, but rather an external
module.  This makes interaction of the type you would like rather more
difficult, I believe.  Although slight changes (like the patch that
Henrique sent to show windows moving in the pager in real time) might
make it easier.  We'll have to see.  I'll add it to the TO-DO list
with a question mark to remind me to investigate it when I get a
chance.

Something you might want to look into is TkGoodstuff.  While you can't drag a 
window onto TkGoodstuff's Pager Client, you can drag the window's icon (with 
Mouse-Button-2) from TkGoodstuff's WindowList to the desired desktop page on 
TkGoodstuff's Pager Client. 

I have a couple of screenshots of TkGoodstuff which you can view from 
http://mars.superlink.net/ekahler/fvwm.html

Luck++;
Eric.

Rob changed that in 2.xx for some reason long before I took over, so I
can't answer "why" with any certainty other than what you mentioned
above (consistent syntax to run the preprocessor modules).  1.xx used
to behave the way you would like.  I've been thinking about changing
that back and it would be easy to do so.

I believe I put the -cmd parameter in there one day when toying with
the idea of changing that behavior of -f back to what you suggest (the
1.xx behavior) but I never finished.

So, for the sake of being/remaining consistent with other window
managers, I may do this for the next release.  Does anyone have any
serious objections to this?  I know it may mess people up for a few
moments until they read the ChangeLog, but I see no real problems
here.

Hey, it's still beta code so things like this are bound to happen. ;^)

Please do change this. I don't think I have seen any other UNIX program
with a "hidden" system-wide configuration file, so changing fvwm so that
it follows file naming conventions would be a good thing imho.

I try to send this one a second time. I sent it two weeks ago, but
never showed up in my list... is the list rejecting silently message
sent  from an address different from the one you are subscribed to? 

Hi all. 
Yesterday exiting fvwm I could read this errors in my console
(repeated a lot of times, no idea how much, filled the console buffer):

[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM] [FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 2, EventType: 28

The "more" is that till in this version there is some problem with timed
events.  
   AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "I" Raise 
   + "M" Move 
   + "D" RaiseLower
I think this is a known problem, but... for example if you have the 
standard "raise or move" bound to the title bar, and you click, 
wait the right bit, :-) , and hop, the windows got moved even if you 
have released the mouse button and follow you. 

Another one is: if you have set up
   EdgeScroll 100 100
   EdgeResistance 750 50 
   OpaqueMoveSize 40  
and you move a nice solid xterm rapidly from the botton (for exemple)
to the top of screen, stooping mouse on the very top, you can get in a 
situation where your xterm is blocked halfway, and then "jump" to the 
mouse position. But the most surprising thing is that if you release
the mouse when window is blocked, and move it in another part of the
screen, the xterm when start moving "flash" in the mouse position and the
finally go to its right place on top of the screen.

And last, but I suspect it's an interaction with AutoRaise module:
suppose you have like me AutoRaise 2000 and follow mouse focus. Then,
put an xterm window partially overlaying another one , and when you
have your window raised, to the following: 
   Move mouse on the title of the underlying window
   type "exit" and return in it so that you exit just when window
         is raised
   You now have the mouse pointer converted to a dot waiting (I
suppose) raising some target (I suppose because it is not simple to
get the timing right... but it happens now and then). 


Well, fvwm is I think the better WM around the world, fast and nice
looking. I hope this can help to spot the last bugs in it... keep with 
the fantastic work!

Bye,
     Romano.

There has been a proposition on the list a while ago to make fvwm to
recognize a statement similar to #! in shell scripts and use the
correct command. This would allow to use Fvwm[M4][Cpp] when
appropriate.

Maybe it is time to add this. It should not be too complicated.

Hmm, every two days seem to be a nice schedule. And people complain about
MS releasing W95, W96 etc?

Anyway, FvwmButtons-060396 fixes the problems mentioned here, adds a couple
of new features, is a little more stable in general, restates the new syntax
a little, and also has a major man page update. Including a section on the
Arrangment Algorithm.

Feel free to check it out and/or air your opinions, comments, ideas etc.

Vyrdsamt,

I've encountered this as well.  I used to have ClickTime set to 50 in
fvwm 1.xx and I had no problem with raising window being mistaken as a
move.  Now, I have ClickTime set to 150 and fvwm (2.0.41) occasionally
(not always) starts a move even if I had released the mouse.  Have you
tried adjusting the ClickTime parameter?  If you had it set to something
like 750 then I'm sure you wouldn't have this problem, but then you get 
a slight delay in your complex functions which could be annoying.

This also happens to me, but it doesn't have to be a large opaque move,
moving a small rubber-band window will cause the mouse to freeze up and
jump, seems like an interaction with edge scroll where fvwm has to think
about whether to warp to the next page or not, causing the mouse to
freeze up. 

Some other problems I'm currently having with 2.0.41:

1) clicking on a window in the pager will no longer raise the
corresponding window on the screen.

2) when a window is iconified, the icon label is truncated to the width
of the icon, and when you drag the icon the label is not drawn (this may
be a feature).

3) if you lower a window using the Lower command, then you cannot
immediately raise it by clicking inside the window.

4) if the CapsLock key is on then you can not click inside a window to
raise it.

Agreed, fvwm has a lot of potential, but it still has some rough edges.
I hope we can smooth out those rough edges before a public release.

I've seen this request several times, and I must be missing
something.

You can move the windows around *within* the pager to different
desks, thus moving it to another desktop. You can drag windows out of
the pager onto the current desktop (i.e., the inverse of what you
describe). What extra functionality does the olvwm behavior get you?
Can you give an example?

Your message made it to the list fine on

Fri, 1 Mar 1996 04:28:15 -0600 (CST)

The message ID was
<Pine.LNX.3.91.960301110102.16536A-100000@sirio.iet.unipi.it>.

The list does not reject articles from anyone; the FVWM-Announce list does,
but that's a different story.  And nothing would ever be rejected silently;
I'd be asked to approve it.

Works for me.  Middle mouse button raises the corresponding window
and gives it the focus, left and right buttons move left/right in
the pager.  Maybe this is a configuration issue?  I don't think I
have anything unusual regarding the pager in my .fvwm2rc.

The mouse button has a different state when Caps Lock is on.  Change
the "modifiers" entry on whichever mouse binding this is to "A" for
"Any" and that should make CapsLock+Button1 work.  It will also of
course bind Control+Button1 and Shift+Button1...

Hmmm... seems a heck of a lot smoother than most "fully released"
window managers I've used (olwm, twm, 4Dwm, and their virtual-screen
brethren).  I think at this point the main problem is getting all
the features fully explained to the users... :-)

Ah, so that's it.  I was used to the behavior in 1.xx where button 1
raises while button 2 moves.

This is a non-optimum solution so me.  If I had this binding in my
.fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1		W	A	Raise

Then control-button1, shift-button1, and meta-button1 becomes
unavailable to me.  I think it's better to change fvwm so that it raises
the window whether the caps lock key is set or not, or maybe add a new
modifier context L that's in effect when the caps lock is set?  Hmm,
that may not be a bad idea, all the other modifier keys shift, control,
meta, mod1 through mod5 are recognized, why not caps lock?

Another question, does the A (any) context include the context N
(none)?  Seems like it does.

I come from a background of ctwm, which I think is the second best
window manager next to fvwm, fvwm definitely looks nicer, which is
the main reason I switched.  But ctwm is better in some areas, icon 
placement for one.  It also has loads of options (a lot of which you
don't need, like cute line warping effects, animation on the title bar,
etc.)  With fvwm's active development scene, I have no doubt that fvwm
will soon surpass most window managers in all areas.  I didn't want to
sound unappreciative of the work people have done.  In fact, I think Rob
and Chuck have done a marvelous job, I just like to see it improved even
more. ;-)  I browsed through the TO-DO list, a lot of cool ideas, but
the one that caught my eyes was the idea to iconify windows down to
their title bars, that would be extremely cool to have.

And CapsLock + Shift, Control, etc as well? :-)

Seems like if this was supported one could use caps-lock to temporarily
toggle into some other set of mouse bindings, if you set up your .fvwm2rc
right.  I can't figure out what good this would do me but I'm sure I could
find something eventually... :-)

Personally I have no current use for the caps lock key at all,
never use it except by mistake, which is why I hadn't run into this
before.

  Either no one tried that patch, or no one noticed that it doesn't work
  very well when moving icons.  As I seldom have icons in my dekstop I
  didn't notice it until today.

  This new patch, implemented somewhat differently, does seem to behave
  properly for moving icons, and windows of course.  To accomplish this,
  and greatly reduce the communications overhead during a move, I created a
  new message type, M_MOVING_WINDOW.

  While I was debugging it, I had to patch FvwmDebug to handle this new
  type of message, as wells as two other messages it was currently
  regarding as unknown.

  The patch below should be applied from the fvwm-2.0.41 directory and to
  the ORIGINAL code, i.e. it is not a patch to my previous patch, but a
  patch to the released code.

Hi,

I've experienced several crashes of openwin with
fvwm 1.24r. This occured randomly (about after one
or two weeks use) when I tried to access the FvwmPager...

Here's the stack trace I could get afterwards:

=>[1] MoveViewport(0x0, 0x384, 0x1, 0x0, 0x38, 0x4), at 0x242f8
  [2] ExecuteFunction(0xa, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x44e3c, 0x8), at 0x231c4

Any help would be grateful,

Desc...

No, you won't get *extra* functionality. It's just easier. What do you think:
If you want to move a window, is it easier to grab the real window and drop it
over the Pager onto another desktop, or is more convenient to pick up the
*small* representation (7x7 pixel) in the GoodStuff and drag this. If you say,
the second option is better, then you won't get extra functionality from this
olvwm-like behaviour.
It's the same with the zooming effect. It's just a little feature that gives
you a hint, where your icon went.

M.W.

I've noticed a similar problem when running solaris 2.4 on a sparc20 and fvwm2.

Motif programs seem to have the most problem. They crash my X server occasionally but not alway. from what I can determine is that it has somthing to do with a signal being caught

I'm not sure if this is a fvwm problem but if anyone knows what is happening, I would be grateful.

	For I see on this list a lot of demands wich seems to forget the real 
point of fvwm, it's low memory cost, I just wanted to say that for me noting is 
missing :-) I use to work with DecWindow mwm under VMS and fvwm is so more 
powerfull that my own poor PC machine can do a lot more with desktop
configuration than my DEC4000-90 at work despite it's only 16Mb Ram. So thanks
to all of you developers and mainteners for that great work. And if I can just 
give you one idea : forget about Win95-and-so-on configuration look-like :-)))

Hello,

I have downloaded fvwm.2.0.41.tar.gz file, but When i try to compile using
make this is the error message that i get: 

making all in ./libs...
cc -O -pipe   -I. -I/libs       -DSHAPE -DXPM   -target sun4 -c  CatString3.c
"CatString3.c", line 12: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"CatString3.c", line 17: a undefined
"CatString3.c", line 19: b undefined
"CatString3.c", line 21: c undefined
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `CatString3.o'
Current working directory /tmp_mnt/nobackup/yvpec/xfvwm/fvwm-2.0.41/libs
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'
 i have checked the file but it seems that the error is not their coz
a , b, c are the arguments, which means they are defined.

the problem maybe because iam using cc instead of gcc but i could not
chnage that .
the readme , install, and todo, dont say much about it. 
i have tried to set the BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS but it didnt work.


can some one please advice me on that.

Thank you very much.

Hello, fellow fvwm users.

I just wanted to congratulate with the good work done with the
installation procedure in v41, I just upgraded from v35. The only
thing I had to do extra was to run ranlib on libfvwm2.a before beeing
able to link it. This might be due to anomalities in our imake
configuration, I don't know for sure.

One small bug report though:

The *FvwmPagerIconGeometry directive does not work if NoIconTitle is
set for the pager and *FvwmPagerStartIconic is also set. The icon
always come up at +0+0 (Upper left corner), but the pager believes it
has the correct placement and display the icon at this position.


At last one question:

Is it possible to perform actions on window that have
CirculateSkipIcon,CirculateSkip attributes set? Why? I am using
xsession as a login manager and want to have it unmapped most of the
time (Not even an icon). I have a button in the button-bar to pop it
up and down:

*FvwmButtons 	  -	 x-43x29.xpm		Next [xsession]		Iconify

But this won't work if the above attributes are set. So, why not just
have them set? Well, when I bought a PC at home I discovered that Meta
Tab circulated between applications in Windows. I thought it was a
nice feature so I put this in .fvwmrc:

Key Tab 	A	2	Next [CurrentDesk CurrentScreen] Focus
Key Tab 	A	S2	Prev [CurrentDesk CurrentScreen] Focus

and voila. The problem is that fvwm tries to warp to the iconified
xsession window which have no icon and just hits empty space as there
are no icon there making the warping quite annoying as I sometimes
need two extra strokes to switch beetween two windows on
CurrentScreen. If someone have any ideas on this I would be VERY
interested.

One last thing, when (if ever) will FvwmButtons be able to swallow an
iconified FvwmPager, or equivalently, when will FvwmPager be able to
just show the current desktop (not iconified)?

This posting became a bit longer than I planned. I am sorry if I
wasted your valuable time (and bandwidth).

Best regards,
Roy.

That is the real problem.  Fvwm will always have rough edges, but the
docs definitely needed (and still need) expanding.

I think that there will only be like one more release before the first
official one.  It'll fix a few more buglets, improve the docs a little
bit more, fixup the install process just a hair more, and it should be
about as ready as ever to be official.  Then the real fun starts...

Umm, I used to use it to clean up my current screen.  For example,
take *this* window (*this* being the one under the pointer) and drag it
to desk 3.

The extra functionality is that when I am moving my windows from the
current screen to another, I have a *big* target to click the mouse
on, instead of little teeny weeny windows in the pager.

I've seen Netscape bring down our X servers here, and it seems to be
linked to the motif scrollbar somehow.  I don't know if it's exactly
the same problem that you are seeing, but I thought it was worth
mentioning.  It's happening under AIX 3.2.5, X11R5, Motif 1.2.4.  I do
believe that some patch installed under AIX fixes it though.

I don't believe it has anything to do with fvwm, since it's killing X
itself and some people here see it under mwm as well.

You are probably using 'Restart fvwm' instead of 'Restart fvwm2'.  Try
the latter.

Hi,

     I downloaded fvwm-2.0.41.tar.gz and unarchived into /root.  I then ran:

          MakeMakefile
          make
          make install

as root.  I then copied the example xinitrc and fvwmrc files included in the 
archive to /root/.xinitrc and /root/.fvwmrc and ran startx.  fvwm 1.23 came up 
and ran fairly successfully but with some error messages.  So I editted 
/root/.xinitrc so the line that mentions fvwm now has fvwm2.  When I run startx 
X seems to start, giving me the familiar blue screen background and x curser but
nothing else.  So I exit X with control shift backspace and see the error 
message:

          xinit: connection to server lost

I know I don't know what I'm doing so could some kind person help me to complete
the installation.

     I am using Linux /Slackware 2.3 coff(a.out) based kernal 1.2.8 on a 486 DX2
w/ 8m ram 1.6G hd and 64m swap partition.  Up til now I have been successfully 
using whatever version of fvwm slackware 2.3 installs (1.23 I think).

     I don't think the problem is with linux I think I just didn't do some 
obvious install step.

     By the way /root is my root account home directory as you probably guessed.
I thought I could experiment with fvwm2.x by putting the init files in there and
prepending a '.' to their names.

Thanks,
Jack

The problem *is* that you're cc. The function CatString3() is defined
using ANSI syntax. I just took a quick look at the rest of lib/ and
lots, if not all, the files use ANSI.

If you have gcc installed, you can use it simply by giving the command
(after making the Makefiles as usual):

        make CC=gcc

Judging by the compiler line included in your error report, this should
work.

If you haven't gcc or some other ANSI compiler you have a big problem :(

Well, fvwm has everything I want today and if development stopped
today, I wouldn't mind.  (Well, except for bug fixes---there are
always bugs, but I haven't noticed any bugs in ages.)

I agree 100% too.  If you want win95, NT, OS/2, mwm, etc., then you
should use them and get some other package to let you use X.

Apologies if this has been mentioned before but I checked the FAQ, BUGS, TO-DO, and man pages and I couldn't find it.

Importance: 
I've only seen it happen in one instance so far and that wasn't at all
critical.

Description: 
FvwmTalk incorrectly parses some arguments.

Example dialog in FvwmTalk: 
DeskTopSize 2x3
fvwm: DesktopSize requires two arguments
DeskTopSize 2 x 3
fvwm: DesktopSize requires two arguments
DeskTopSize 2 3

(the last one worked)

Environment:
X11R5 and DEC OSF/1 3.0 on a DEC 3000/300LX Alpha.

Version:
Fvwm Version 2.0.41

Compile: 
xmkmf;make Makefiles;make
I used cc, not gcc.  The only changes I made to the defaults dealt
with where to put files and what to call them.

Dear List:

  I'm having a problem running MakeMakefiles...I believe that my problem
is implementation specific, but I am looking for a clue, if anyone could
point me in the right direction...

  My symptoms look like that which follows:

Making Makefile in modules/FvwmIconBox
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
makedepend -D__alpha  -D__osf__ -I -I/usr/include -s "# DO NOT DELETE" --   -I.
-I../../libs    -DDEC -DR5_XLIB -DSMT  -DFUNCPROTO=3 -DSHAPE -DXPM  -- FvwmIconB
ox.c icons.c
makedepend: warning:  icons.c: cannot find include file "X11/xpm.h"
        not in X11/xpm.h
        not in -I/usr/include/X11/xpm.h
        not in ./X11/xpm.h
        not in ../../libs/X11/xpm.h
        not in /usr/include/X1


  I get many more 'warnings' reporting that the xpm.h file is not found
where the Makefile expects.  Is there a way that I can specify the path 
to the xpm.h file?

  Thanks in advance,

  Geoff

Is one of the buglets the broken restart (or is that classified as a
bug-gar?) ;-0

In case you forgot, I'm referring to the situation where you have a
.fvwmrc that contains pre-processor lines like

	FvwmCpp ".fvwm/fonts-cpp"

If you restart, these lines are apparently not read (at least the
settings don't take effect. I get what appear to be some system wide
defaults). So restarting is kind of pointless for me.

Also, upon restart existing XEmacs windows become useless -- they
don't accept input anymore (I usually just kill them off via
delete-frame() and make a new onw).

In case it matters, I forgot to mention my way of restarting. I use
the following:

AddToMenu Quit-Verify 	"Really Quit Fvwm?" Title	
+		      	"Yes, Really Quit"  Quit	
+		      	"Restart Fvwm"	    Restart fvwm
+		      	"Start twm"         Restart ctwm
+		      	"Start mwm"    	    Restart mwm
+	      	      	"Start olwm"        Restart /usr/openwin/bin/olwm
+		        "Start tvtwm"       Restart vtwm
+		      	"Start dummy"       Restart xterm
+		      	""		    Nop	
+		      	"No, Don't Quit"    Nop	

Note I have `fvwm' instead of `fvwm2' (my version of fvwm-2.0.41 is
installed as `fvwm', as I'm the only one here who uses it so
far). Should I be passing an arg to fvwm above? (Is that even
possible?) Doesn't it re-read .fvwmrc upon restarting by default?

mb> Also, upon restart existing XEmacs windows become useless -- they
mb> don't accept input anymore

Oops. Sorry. I think this one is fixed, at least for the fvwm-2.0.41 /
XEmacs-19.14 combo. I just tried it after I sent the mail and
restarted, and XEmacs seemed to respond OK (though I haven't tried
many restarts to test if it's intermittent).

If you're having trouble with finding your icons then try the 
FvwmIconMan. It work likes the window list in tvtwm and is IMHO the 
solution to those pesky disapearing icons. :)

Yes Praise time! Lets all not forget to stop periodical and shower Chuck and
the rest of the contributes with thanks and cheers for their great work.
Also we all thank Rob Nation for dreaming up and creating this wonderful 
window manager.

OK, I will bite.... I really like fvwms' current feature list much more
then other window managers total features, however there are a number of 
"missing" features that I think would be nice. Times change and creative
people come up with feature on various WMs that can improve any WM.
I used to use tvtwm, but I thought the 3d look was enough better that I
was willing to do without all the nice pixmap support for buttons and 
title bars, its' nicer icon manager, and other features. I for one am very 
glad to see some of that support finally starting to get added to FVWM.

I as long term Unix user have often pooh poohed Windows and such. However
I now find that I spened half my time at work using FVWM, and the other
half at home with Win95 and XWin32 doing the same things I do at work. All
except the window manager. There are some feature in Win95 that are
convienient to say the least. They have had a chance to look at what the
other WM's have done right and wrong, and have made some good decisions
that would be nice to see on other window managers. (Thanks God there is a
public domain Win95 utility that turns off click to type.... )

I am not speaking "emulation per say", but Win95 does pixmaps well, and
their icon manager is very appealing. I also really like to click on a
"window"  and have it come to the foreground. This is alot more straight
forward then trying place my pointer on a thin "window border" like I do
with FVWM. The way it deals with color maps to "keep from running out" is
also slick. 

I know this is creaping featureism, and not something that Rob Nation 
wanted to do himself, but as long as some of these features can pass
the bloat test, or be confined to modules, I would like to see FVWM 
continue to "grow" and continue as "the best" and "my favorite" WM.

I bound the RaiseLower function to a key, which is how I got around the
problem of hunting for a border.  One of the few things I ever liked about
OpenWindows was the L6 "Raise" key on the Sun keyboards...

If you want to use the mouse you could perhaps use shift+mouse1 like:
Mouse 1         W       S	Raise
You could of course replace the "S" with "N" and just use mouse1 to
raise the window... but then you have to use shift+mouse1 to do things
like grabbing text.

I still don't see this.  I use XEmacs constantly (as you know) and
restart a lot when I'm doing fvwm stuff between real work or
before/after hours and I've never had this problem.  I'm not sure what
to say to this.

RTFM.  Make sure you have XPM available locally, and there are vars
you can set in the Fvwm.tmpl to point to it.  If you don't know what
Fvwm.tmpl is, grab the latest version (2.0.41) or look for the same
vars in configure.h/makefile.h.

With the recent talk of restart problems, I though I'd add that
I cannot Restart FVWM2 V2.0.41 at all.  Whenever I do, I get returned
to the shell (X-Windows exits).

I'm running FVWM on top of Openwin 3.0.  Has anyone else had this problem
at all?

I have:

for me, windows that show up many times temporarily,
e.g. in xfig some menus to ask for the grid size,
or when i reart many times in a row, windows become
smaller, xterms, for instance. i have to explicitly
resize them, quit vi or whatever and run the program
again (to make sure the program or its curses library
know the new size of the window).

you can try to reproduce it (i have 2.0.40) with
xfig by changing from no grid to grid and the
reverse many times or just by restarting several
times with an xterm around.

regarding win95, i also dislike win95 and much more m$,
but the interface itself, i kind likei, simple and easy
(i think that is a feature of it).

this started as a joke, then i found some code from
someone from europe (who i can't seem to contact any
more) and i after some coding, i have a hack on
2.0.40 that looks pretty close to win95.
(it actually feels much better bc i don't have to pay
a dime to m$ and i can also configure my interface as much
as i want.) you can take a look at it (71kb file):

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cpg/fvwm95.gif
(fear not, you can change the start logo to an
x window system logo easily :)

you can also see in the picture how the small xfig window
ends up after a few times of showing up and going away.

if someone would like to take the code and put it up to
speed with current sources, let me know. i promised
i would not pass around the code, but i can't contact
the author and i have hacked the code myself now some
so i kind of feel i can do it ...

greetings,

search for "fvwm" and came to the "Official FVWM Page" and searched for
"sound" and "multimed" in FAQs and places and found nothing. Is there
anything to be found?

FYI:

I found that when trying to "Restart fvwm2", I get a segmentation fault
whenever I restart fvwm2.  I can either specify the full pathname or
just specify fvwm2 if its in the pathname, but in either case it causes
a segfault.  (If it doesn't exist in my path, it just says restart failed.)

Can someone give me a pointer in trying to track this down?

Hi folks,

Here is a patch to exec command through your favorite shell instead of
 /bin/sh.
fvwm get the shell from the SHELL environment variable (if it found it) or put
/bin/sh as the default shell.

I tested it on my sun box solaris 2.4 (i use csh). it work fine for me.

Just a question how can i patch code from diff -ur command (on my solaris i
haven't this option) and patch hang to patch the code.

Here's the patch.

I use `-xrm "*iconGeometry: +<X>+<Y>"' as an argument to the application at

It works for me!

for all those, not using the caps lock key (and hating to accidently invoke

Question - does this mean I can call a command from FvwmButtons without the full
pathname? That would be *very* useful indeed, especially for less experienced
users who wonder why stuff doesn't appear.

(I imagine that this is what the patch is for, just want to check before going and
FTP'ing the source over again. If this is a silly question blame lack of sleep!)

Hi Albrecht, fellow fvwm'ers,

> it): 

> xmodmap -e 'clear lock'

Why not go one step further and turn it into something useful, I've
turned mine into a Window Manager key, by making it the Mod2 modifier,
you could map it to any modifier (Mod1 is Alt, Mod2, 3, 4, and 5 are
normally free). Then you don't have any problems with application
which want to use Alt-<something> which you just happen to have mapped
for your window manager. Now, you can have as many window manager
bindings as you want, and you'll never conflict with some dopey
application :-)

all you need is:

xmodmap -e 'clear lock'
xmodmap -e 'add Mod2 Caps_Lock'

and then you'll need to change your window manager bindings of course
:-)

Good luck,

Steve

 yes , and if you use csh or tcsh you can use ~ for $HOME... It work like mwm
(which use the SHELL variable to spawn process). I run fvwm redirect it to the
console, and see all message from the client. It's usefull when debugging, and
with csh you obtain the pid of the process (if you have to kill them).

Enjoy this

Hi All,

The problem is I use commands which rely on a backtake, and with the new syntax of FvwmButtons
which states that commands should be between ` ` useing backtakes is impossible/difficult
I don't know how to escape them and I don't want to write numerious scripts to substitute the
command.

So I will be very happy if someone could explain me how to escape the backtake, or if the
old syntax (commands between parentheses) will be used again

*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow(NoKill, UseOld, NoHints) "xload" `Exec xload -label "`uname -n`" &`)
                                                                               ^^ a problem
																			   
This would pose no problems:
*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow(NoKill, UseOld, NoHints) "xload" (Exec xload -label "`uname -n`" &))

 Emiel Witteman

Hi over there!

Someone here noticed that fvwm's behaviour with moving/resizing windows 
has changed somewhat between 1.24 and the current version: the colors
that are used when drawing the border is calculated diffently now. The
problem is this: moving/resizing windows on a black background makes
the border invisible; not the most pleasant situation. I've scanned
the sourcecode but couldn't locate the color-calculating code so I'll
submit the problem here, since I don't have the time to take a closer
look.

Grtz,
  Wichert.

I'm not sure why some people are having this problem suddenly, but try
setting the following in your .fvwm2rc:

XORvalue 1

(try numbers from 1-255)

In pub/in-progress now at merv.philosophy.lsa.umich.edu is an early
4.1b6 with some big changes that need refinement and debugging.
Comments of all kinds are welcome.

  - There is a new preferences manager that will cause some havoc
  until it's in better shape.  For now, it's usable.  Here is what
  you will need to do to migrate:

     Start up tkgoodstuff.  You will get a default configuration.
     Select Preferences from the tkgoodstuff menu, and choose the
     "Configuration" section.  Here, copy all the Client, AddButton,
     AddLabelBox, stacking, and panel-creating commands, BUT NOT
     VARIABLE SETTING COMMANDS, from your old .tkgoodstuffrc.  Then,
     save the preferences and restart.  Now you can set the things you
     had previously adjusted with variables using the preferences
     manager. 

     Configuration/preferences information is now kept by default in
     ~/.tkgrc, which you can edit manually if necessary, but which is
     supposed to be maintained primarily by the preferences manager.

     One awkwardness I need to adjust: preferences for sub-panel
     clients don't show up in the preferences manager until you first
     open the sub-panel.

     Another: the technique for letting you debug configurations is
     probably too fragile (if there is an error swallowing your config
     file, you get a stack trace and the preferences manager).

Html documentation does not exist for this stuff yet, and the html
docs on tkgoodstuffrc files and variable-setting in Clients is of
course all false.

Fvwm folks may not have heard about the changes in 4.1b5:

4.1b5: 2/27/96

  Now tkgoodstuff assumes tk4.1b1 or later (we're aiming at supporting
  the ultimate 4.1 release, and backward compatibility is too much
  work). 

     - tkgoodstuff: 

       + We use the grid geometry manager rather than pack for
       almost everything.  TKGPack is superseded by TKGGrid.

       + Added subpanels which are formed with StartPanel and
       EndPanel, can be linked to a button with PanelButton, or placed
       on the screen at startup with PutPanel.  See the tkgoodstuffrc
       html docs for more.

       + Now xpm capability is mandatory.  I hope Ioi Lam's xpm image
       type extension will get in the core before our main 4.1 release.

       + "create-label-box" renamed to "TKGLabelBox".  NOTE!!!

       + AddButton and AddLabelBox no longer take a name as first
       argument.  NOTE!!!

       + Clock_zerotrim moved to tkgoodstuff and called TKGZeroTrim.

       + Use "ps -p [pid]" if "ps [pid]" gives an error, and don't
       assume there's a STAT column in the ps output (thanks
       J. Robinson).

       + Implement TKGAddToHook and TKGDoHook (general hook
       utilities).  Several hooks are defined (for client use) in
       tkgoodstuff, Fvwm.tcl, etc.

       + Change default fonts to non-italic, non-bold.

     - Biff: avoid tcl7.5b1's gets bugs by not doing "gets $f var".

     - New client "Pager" by Eric Kahler.  Check out the current
     version in this distribution.  Needs tkgoodstuff to be run as an
     fvwm module (from the fvwm window manager).

     - New client "Chooser" by Eric Kahler.  Pops up a window at
     startup to let you choose among different tkgoodstuff
     configuration files.

     - New client in "alpha" stage: Calc (dec/hex/oct calculator).
     Has paper-tape-like scrollable history.  Some features not
     implemented, but it's fairly usable.  I'm not inclined to develop
     this further right now, so I'd be very happy if someone were to
     adopt it.

     - New client in "beta" stage: Webster (net dictionary client).
     Pops up a definition of the word you highlight (the current X
     selection).  Can use unix "webster" command, but also has its own
     internal webster client code (using the new Tcl socket stuff,
     with a kludge required because Tcl strings can't yet contain
     NULLs).

     - The tkfvwm and tkxpm source is now included in the tkgoodstuff
     distribution.

     - The fvwm WindowList feature has become a client.  To call it,
     you now issue "Client WindowList".  It's become more robust too,
     I hope.  I also added a few default icons for shells, editors,
     mailers, newsreaders.  If it doesn't recognize your favorite
     apps of these types, please let me know the resource Class name,
     and the application type (e.g., "Xmh" is a mailer, "XTerm" is a
     shell). I'd be happy to have some graphically competent person revise
     these or submit other 11x11 icons.

     - Fvwm: fvwm's messages are more easily available to clients, we
     maintain a more complete database of the information available
     from fvwm, and we slightly enhanced tkfvwm (the new version of
     tkfvwm4.1 is needed to take advantage of all the information).
     Look at Fvwm.tcl for more info.  These changes were primarily to
     support WindowList and Eric Kahler's cool Pager client.

     - Clock, Ical, Jots: use the new "clock" command instead of "exec
     date". 

     - Ical: Gave one alarm per item per calendar fetch.  Oops.  Stick
     to one per item.

     - Jots: Made widgets behave sensibly under manual resizing.

     - Net: (bug) call TKGButton, not TKGMakeButton, to change the
     text on a switch of net types.  Also, (feature removal) don't
     bind mouse <3> to change Net_type (too confusing for those who
     don't want it and don't want to know about it, and it's easy
     enough to change types with the popup menu).

Cheers,
Mark

Hi

     I posted yesterday regarding my problem with installing fvwm 2.0.41 under 
Linux.  I have gotten no response to my previous message so I assume that the 
tacit response is to rtfm.  Well I have read the readme files and I didn't see 
anything that would point me in the right direction.  All the make steps 
succeeded with no errors or warnings.  Perhaps I just don't recognize it as 
such.  If this is the case could someone please point me in the right direction.

     Bye the way, I just installed 1.24r successfully this morning.

Jack

I never responded because I was in meetings all day yesterday, and in
a big hurry to go home afterwards (a 6 hour meeting tends to invoke
that reaction).

So, I'll respond now.  I believe it is RTFM.

Here's what you said yesterday:

So, it looks like you are trying to use a .fvwmrc from fvwm 1.23 to
run 2.0.41, which won't work at all, or (more likely) fvwm 2.0.41 is
looking for .fvwm2rc, which doesn't exist, and it is currently useless
in that case (there is the RTFM - it says this in the fvwm2.man file).
I'm planning on making fvwm2 have more defaults built in for the next
release, so it will at least work if no rc file is found.

So, take the system.fvwmrc included in 2.0.41, and copy it to your
home directory as .fvwm2rc, and try it then.

Hi

     I posted yesterday and this morning about not being able to install 2.0.41.
     It turns out it was an rtfm: Chuck was kind enough to answer anyway.  I 
needed .fvwm2rc in my home directory instead of .fvwmrc.

FYI:  

I fixed the problem I was having with Restarting V2.0.41.

The solution was that the compiled I was using, acc V2.0.1, had
some manner of internal error that generated incorrect code.
Switching to acc V3.0 fixed the problem, and allowed Restarts to
proceed happily.

Doing something besides complaining for a change.  Here's a list of 
button styles I've collected from various sources, some come with the 
fvwm source distribution, some I lifted from the dotfile generator, and 
some I created myself by modifying existing ones.

Hi All,

	I am new to this list so please bear with me. I was wondering if you
could utilize the option of push pins on the popup menus in fvwm. The same
option as Open look.


Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Ken

First off, I tried to rebuild fvwm with Jarl's latest FvwmButtons
patches.  (Note I did use the line continuation patch).  I'm afradi the
whoel thing blew up in my face.

I'm going to blame that on operator error for now.  I had applied
multiple patches at the time so most likely I just screwed something up.

The real problem:

I have never been able to specify an xpm for use in a menu with the %%
or ** operators without specifying the explixit path to the graphic.
Since FvwmButtons always worked fine for me using the PixmapBath Bitmap
Path, I'm not sure as to what the problem might be.  Also, Iconified
windows always used the appropriate graphic.  This only occurs for
pull-down menus and those will work with an explicit path.

This has happened for me for every version of fvwm sicne the xpm-menu
patch on 4 different systems each running OSF/1, HP-UX, Linux and AIX.

I assume it's an operator error as well, but it's annoying and I'd like
to fix this one.

Any clues?

Yes. Very nice. It patched against 2.0.41 cleanly.

It was running fine, then FvwmPager died (i.e., it disappeared from
the screen). I forget precisely what I was doing just before I noticed
it's absence. I then checked my .xsessionlog file and found:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  41231
  Current serial number in output stream:  41266
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

right after it went away (I know, this is probably useless, but on the
off chance it helps...)

No real problem -- one can fire up another pager from the modules
pull-down.

I'm using fvwm 2.0.41 (Linux kernel 1.2.13, XFree86 3.1.2).

I've rewritten my fvwmrc file from scratch, and it works well. There's 
one very annoying problem, however.

When I close some transient windows, the mouse pointer changes to a 
little black circle, and fvwm won't let me do anything except move the 
pointer around until I click, then it goes back to the normal pointer. 

This happens most often when I'm closing dialogs netscape pops up (via 
their close button), but its happened with other apps as well. It doesn't 
happen all the time, just often enough so it's an anoying suprise each time.

Anyone know how I can fix this?

Fvwm2.41

Hello All,

Has any one had this problem?  I start fvwm2.41, FvwmButtons
appears load but then quickly exits - no errors reported.  If I 
put a syntax error in a *FvwmButtons line it reports the error 
so I know FvwmButtons is loading and finding the rc file.  

I have tried FvwmButtons-080396 and FvwmButtons-070396, and
applied the patches to fvwm2, and rebuilt XPM under X86Free.3.1.2D.
Still no go.

I have been trying a simple config just to see if I can get it going.

Module FvwmButtons
*FvwmButtonsBack      #80A0A0     
*FvwmButtonsFore      Black     
*FvwmButtonsFont      None 
*FvwmButtonsPadding   1 1
*FvwmButtonsGeometry  +10+10
*FvwmButtonsColumns   1

*FvwmButtons(Icon start.xpm, Action 'Exec "ansi_xterm" exec ansi_xterm')
*FvwmButtons(Icon start.xpm, Action 'Exec "ansi_xterm" exec ansi_xterm')

Any clues?

Myabe I shoudlnt' have been so quick as to assume I goofed up something
in Jarl's releases.

That's what happened to me in the 3/8 release.  Except I would never see
an FvwmButtons window.  It would just start all of the chile (to be
swallowed) apps and then stop.  I'm not 100% that the process died.
I'll have to check it again, but that's essentially what happened.  It
never came up with the new format.

I'll be honest, I presently don't have too much of a need for the
features, but I would like to see if this program handles dying
processes better.  I've got a problem where xmialbox will spawn a
defunct process if I currently have my xmailapp open.  I was hoping that
maybe the new FvwmButtons would make this behave better or at least I
could use the respawn option so I could just kill my current copy.

Anyway. . . since I haven't got a reply yet why does:


	IconPath /users/arwild01/.icons/
	PixmapPath /users/arwild01/.icons/

	AddToMenu Xterms "XTerms"       Title
	+	"Local Xterm%/users/arwild01/.icons/starbase.xbm%"	Exec xterm -name starbase -ls &

That work, but this doesn't? (Assuming the same IconPath/PixmapPath
specification)  BTW, I'll admit that my file was originally based on
someone else's working .fvwm2rc.  I can only me blamed for 50% of the
errors in here.  That, and the stupidy not to confirm everything.

	AddToMenu Xterms "XTerms"       Title
	+	"Local Xterm%starbase.xbm%"	Exec xterm -name starbase -ls &

Only if you use FvwmForm and it acts wierdly. Otherwise no, they are not 
worth worrying about (in my book anyway  :)

Thanks alot :-) You're probably not too far off mark, I prefer just to code

There were lots of quirks in the loading of icons, that should be history
now. I've thrown it all out and link with the Picture code in fvwmlib.
Actually that's the same that fvwm menus use. Yes there is a bug in it
(see below)

As mentioned above, there's a stupid bug in Picture.c: first it searches
the pixmap path for the icon, when it doesn't find it there it gives up.
See? Not just me who make the bugs. :-) This one I even fixed, there is a 
patch for it on my page.

FvwmButtons will be settling down soon, I have almost all the features I
wanted to do, and there really aren't that many bugs. I use it all the time
without problems, and several other people run it fine.
I might have introduced incompatibilities with some systems though, so 
please report if you get problems with compiling etc.

No, today's version is not out yet. Seems it will be tomorrows version 
instead :-)  New features: Popup menus that work, more streamlined syntax,
bitmap icons works again, option to use WM_DELETE_WINDOW or KillClient for
sending children to bed, handles resizing to 0, and a surprise I'm working
on. You'll just have to wait.

Well, from your descriptions, the changes sound outstanding.  I just
wish I could see them.

Well, xmailbox will use the X resource xmailapp to spawn an application.
In my case I invoke elm within an xterm.  The problem is, elm will only
let you have one copy open. . . . . 

So, if one is already open the process becomes <defunct> on my AIX box.
Linux, and HP-UX seem to handle this scenario okay.  What irks me is,
since i have process limits, if I let this go for some period of time I
cannot spawn any mores processes.

I figure this isn't an FvwmButtons problem, it's am xmailbox problem.
BUT if I just kill xmailbox, I loose my FvwmButtons and I have to
restart it.  I was hoping the new versions would let this process die
cleanly and then respawn it.  Unfortunately, I have yet to check it out.

> As mentioned above, there's a stupid bug in Picture.c: first it searches

But my icons are in the Pixmap path.  Is this a problem with the search
methodology?  Or maybe I have a syntax error.  I'll have to check out
tomorrow's release, I guess.

I was unable to run it using one of your example?.fvwmrc files.  Much
less, attempting to re-code my own.

Hopefully these bugs will be stamped out soon enough.  I'm interested in
rebuilding my button bar so I can use pull down menus to get to my
applications.  I'm really getting some great ideas here, but I have to
wait for the new patches.

I also need to start working on a collection of 16x16 icons.  Does any
one have a GOOD way of converting older icons?  I currently use some
nice 32x32 icons, but when I shrink them they look bad.  Unfortunately,
I'm not enough of an artist to correct the errors by hand.

thanks
-Alan

I get this as well with many actions, its not a major problem but can be

Alright!

After recovering from the last disk crash, the latest version of FvwmButtons
is out on the home page.

Featuring real popup menus (small fvwm patch needed), icon loading through
fvwmlib's Picture routine (same as fvwm's menus use, patch available to fix
the bitmap problems), left aligned icons ala fvwm menus, better quoting,
simpler specification of flags in config file, optional separate config file,
neater exposure handling, nicer when closing children on exit, fixed bitmap
icons... mmm seems that's it. The big suprise I promised will just have to
wait a while... No it's not the interactive configuration.

Enjoy!

Vyrdsamt,

Following the 'mailtool' question another user of fvwm here has
a question that I cannot answer.

When using sun's file manager the properties dialogue has a little pull down list
of sections, unfortunately it vanishes under the window everytime it is clicked
on, moving the window doesn't help nor does lowering the autoraise time.

Can the OpenLook patch take care of this type of problem as well?
I'm sure someone out there must have a work around even.

I tend not to use File Mangler (oops, Manager) at all and was unaware of this
problem.

I think its time for 'xfm' to be compiled.

   The first of Jarl's new FvwmButtons I tried was 080396,
and now I've tried 110396 with the three fvwm patches he
has on his page.  With either version, if I attempt to use
an icon, I get an X error (BadDrawable, I think).  If I
attempt to use a title, I get no error, but FvwmButtons
doesn't run.

   With 080396, this configuration:

*FvwmButtons(2x1 Swallow "FvwmPager" 'Module FvwmPager 0 1')

worked.  (Well, if another button had a Size option
specified, that worked.)  With 110396, that doesn't work.

   I suppose I'll re-install the basic fvwm-2.0.41 sometime
today so I can do some work, but I'm wondering what's going
on.  Unfortunately I have no X11 programming experience, so
I can't help too much.

   This is all with the Xfree86 3.1.2 Mach8 server on
Linux 1.3.69, libc 5.0.9.

This is another 'somthing I've been wondering about' type 
questions....Please bear with me cuz I don't know much about programming X.
Here we go....
	Instead of changing the color if the text IN the xterms (or in 
the title bars) Would it be possible to change the color of the border of 
xterms on a semi-individual basis....ie. All xterms with a field 'X' in 
their title or based upon which machine they originate, etc.... 
It sounds a lot like some sort of style flag (which people seem to hate 
adding...and I don't mean that as a criticism)....I was wondering if the 
concept was outright impossible or extremely difficult or even simple....

Hi all,
I have been using the top-down before left-right placement patch for a while,
and there's still one thing I am not capable of:

How can I avoid windows to be placed over the IconBox? I have the Pager 
in the top-left corner, and anything vertically below the pager is Iconbox,
but new windows keep aligning with the left border of the screen. Is 
there a way to avoid this?

TIA
Frank

----------

If you  use "mwm" menus, and you  pop them up  too  close to the right
hand edge of the screen, you may find that a submenu pops up obscuring
the parent  menu, making it  impossible to  select something else from
the parent menu.

Enclosed is a patch to 2.0.41 that fixes the problem. The patch causes
sub-menus  to pop up on the   right until the right   hand edge of the
screen is hit, then submenus start popping up on the left.

This is a timing problem in FvwmPager. I posted a patch some time ago,
but either it didn't make it to the list or it has not been applied.

It will happen when you drag a window - in the pager, of course -
from another desk to the current page of the current desk.

Dragging the window *out* of the pager doesn't cause the problem.

Hello,

I have this link-editing problem bugging me. 
I'm trying to compile (and link) fvwm-2.0.41 on a 
"sequent, symmetry, 3.2.0 V2.1.6 i386".

The problem lies in the link-edit phase, where ld
issues the following fatal error message:

	ld fatal: cannot write section .data of file /usr/lib/libX11.a

The command:
	$ cc -o FvwmCpp FvwmCpp.o -O -Xa -L/tmp/libs  -L../../libs -lfvwm2 
		-lXpm  -lXext -lX11  -lXbsd -lsocket -linet -lnsl -lseq

I don't get it. Do you? If so, please mail your solution to the mailing list.
I'd be very grateful. :-)

Greetz, Micha.

PS. I know this has nothing to do with fvwm in particular, but I'm desperate.

I have that patch still, but it frightened me somewhat, so I haven't
played with it yet.  It's the sleep that bothers me, actually.  I
understand the sync, but I want to know why the sleep is needed.  I'm
wondering if there isn't a more correct fix (if not, of course I'll
use yours).  I'll look into it when I get a chance.

Mark, I included Grant's patch below so you can give it a try if you'd
like.

I have that patch still, but it frightened me somewhat, so I haven't
played with it yet.  It's the sleep that bothers me, actually.  I
understand the sync, but I want to know why the sleep is needed.  I'm
wondering if there isn't a more correct fix (if not, of course I'll
use yours).  I'll look into it when I get a chance.

Mark, I included Grant's patch below so you can give it a try if you'd
like.

It seems to me that there is some period of time between sending the
XReparentWindow (a few lines above) and the server actually accomplishing
the reparenting. If the FvwmPager tries to set the focus before the
reparenting is complete, the BadMatch error happens.

Incidentally, I reduced the delay from 50,000 to 5,000 (microsec) when
installing 2.0.41 and it still seems to work fine. I agree, though, that it
would be nice to have something other than a delay. About the only thing I
can think of, though, is to wait for an event, such as ReparentNotify, which
would be a pain (and would also, presumably, have to time out to prevent the
pager from locking up if something goes wrong).

I like it! I've wanted this for some time.

But... a small bug.

First, my setup: SparcStation 5, SunOS 4.1.4, Fvwm 2.0.41.

It's true that, when there's no room on the right, submenus appear on the left.
The problem is that the new menus appear to the left of *all* the menus. You
get an arrangement like this:

    menu4 MENU> menu2> menu3> edge-of-screen

This means that I can't reach menu4. Menu4 will stay posted if I move the
pointer over the submenu arrow from menu3, but that makes the feature difficult
to use.

I would guess that, when posting menus toward the left, fvwm should ignore
previous menus posted toward the right. Conceivably this should also hold true
when switching from left to right as well, but it would take a *lot* of
submenus to get that far.

*sigh* How come there can be so many problems with a simple little
program like this?? Anyway, as usual I was unable to reproduce the
problem properly. And as usual there is a new release.

The new release has lots of debugging output turned on during 
startup, and there is a sample buttonrc which can be used for
testing. There is even instructions on how to install this separate
from the old FvwmButtons, which probably is a good idea seeing
that it simply will not work for some of you.

Hope I haven't made any problems for you, but hey - it's not even in
the beta yet :-)

And again, thanks to all of you who try out FvwmButtons and tell
me what happens. Now, if only some more of you who get it working
can send me small "I did it!" mails, things would get a little
cozier around here :-)

I asked Chuck for this to get in the next fvwm beta, so please: let's
hurry get that one last bug out of there before he decides its too
risky..

Ah, yes. Now I remember. That is exactly what I was doing at the
time. But, I can't reproduce the bug consistently on my platform
(Solaris-2.3, Sparc10), presumably because it is a timing problem that
only shows up sporadically.

Yes, I've never noticed a problem dragging out.

That seems like an acceptable delay if it does cure the problem. I
agree, though, that a solution without this sleep delay would be
desireable. Perhaps a compile-time option to enable the work-around if
sites notice the timing problem on a sufficiently regular basis (I've
tried to get FvwmPager to quit pretty hard the last hour or so,
dragging many windows to the current page of the current desk and
changing focus like crazy, and the pager refuses to die again).

If I didn't place the leftward menus to the left of all menus, I would
create  the same problem I  was trying to  fix, Ie. obscuring menus so
that they can't be popped down.

If you can manage to go off menu3 to  the right, you can circle around
all the menus and get into menu4.  Since  the new logic avoids putting
menus flush against the right, there  should always be  room to go off
the right.

I am not  sure you can  ignore the  previous menus  to the right,  you
could be moving to the right to pop down a menu.

I work primarily in fvwm, it's my WM of choice.  But, occasionally I have
to switch to olwm for GUI testing.  Unfortunately, I have not discovered a
way to gracefully switch back to fvwm.  As it stands now, when I exit
olwm, I get logged out, and thereby loose all of the work I had running in
other windows.  I've tried killing olwmslave -- this has no apparent
affect.  Neither did I see anything in the pulldown menu that looked
useful.
 
Is it possible to switch back to fvwm from olwm?  If so, how?
 
Environment:  SPARC 20, Solaris 2.4, fvwm 1.24r
 
I have fvwm 2.0.41 available, but haven't switched over to it yet.

There are a lot of different solutions.  The one that I use on all
platforms is the program "xsession".

You can FTP it from ftp.x.org.  I think it's like in /pub/utilities.
"xsession" is used as an X11 session manager.  This then, in turn,
starts the window manager.  If you use xsession as the last active
process in your .xinitrc file, it will hold up X for you.

Unfortunately, that means you have to use xsession to log out of X.
That's why in fvwm I use FvwmForm invoked with the name QuitVerify.
Notice the "kill".

If you Restart olwm (and it uses argv[0] like mwm does) instead of
exitting, it should go back to fvwm (since that should be argv[0]).

Or, you can install XSession and use that to start fvwm and switch
between various window managers.  It's also handy for capturing the
output of fvwm, and for keeping X from going down when the beta
version of fvwm that you downloaded mysteriously coredumps, which
sometimes happens, unfortunately.  :)

Hope this helps.

Later,
Chuck

Rather than switching window managers, you might want to investigate
the Xnest server.  It's an X server that runs in a window on an X
display.  You can manage your main display with fvwm.  Then, in the
Xnest window, run olwm.  Just iconify the window when you don't need
it.

Xnest comes with X11R6.

I would have to disagree here.  Although I am glad someone is looking
into this, I hate excessive mouse motions.

I feel like MwmMenus needs to behave more like mwm anyway.  When you
click on the title of a pull down, that pull down should remian active
until you kill it, or you explicitly click on another option.

Essentially, I want click-to-focus for pull-down menus.  I also want my
menus to pop up in the immediate vicinity that way I don't have to move
my mouse all over the place.  i.e.

	menu1
		menu2
			menu3
		menu4

What do others think?  

I like this methodology, becasue I feel like the less I move the mouse,
the better.  I don't want to have to move my mouse randomly around the
screen in a vain attempt to click on something.

What's really aggrivating is when I open a second popup and I
accidentally pass my mouse over the title of a seperate option and I
could a new menu.  i.e.

	main
	stuff
	applications
	programming

original state.

	main
	stuff		stuff
	applications	stuff
	programming	stuff
			stuff
			stuff
			stuff

"stuff" open

	main
	stuff
	applications	applications
	programming	applications
			applications
			applications
			
after accidentally passing my mouse over "applications".

This is an incredibly difficult concept to demonstrate in ASCII, but I
feel like it's important enough that someone should look at it.

I really wish I had the time, but I'm afraid I have other projects
forthcoming.  :(

 I compiled fvwm-2.0.41 on a SGI running IRIX 5.3. I had compiled it
 with libXpm-4.7. The program compiled ok with some warnings. But
 when I started X from ".xsession" only the windows with the frames
 came up. None of the fvwm modules got executed. No buttons on the
 title bar no pager etc. The same ".fvwmrc" works for the SUN.
 
 None of the button bindings work neither do the mouse i.e. I can't move windows....

 Can somebody please tell me what I'm doing wrong. Also if anyone knows
 of a precompiled IRIX5.3 working version I'd appreciate a pointer to it.

 Thanks

 Ananda

It should be possible using lines in your .fvwm2rc file like:

Style "*host1*"       Color black/grey
Style "*host2*"       Color green/yellow
Style "*host3*"       Color black/darkblue

The string in quotes is compared to the window's name, class and
resource string and the style is applied to all windows which match.


P.S. Don't actually use Green/Yellow, it is *really* bad for the eyes!

We just switched to Lotus Notes 3.? at work for email, etc.  I have a lot 
of problems with it when in Fvwm (1.?).  Notes seems to run better when I 
use olwm.  I have a Sun Sparc2 running SunOS 4.1.3.  I don't really know 
anything about X programming, so the error messages I get don't mean much 
to me.  Notes crashes my X windows completely.  The one operation I found 
that does it 100% is a window resize of the address book popup.

I guess I'm just looking for any hints from experienced Notes/fvwm users, 
if there are any.  Does Notes 4.x solve any of these problems?  I have 
32Mb of ram and notes uses a large chunk of it.  I can only open about 5 
xterms when notes is running.  This pretty much eliminates the need of 
multiple workspaces, my favorite feature of fvwm.

Any advice or comments would greatly be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kevin

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Is there a way to have one popup menu item start two
programs?  I'm using fvwm 1.?

For example:

Popup
        Exec    "PSpice Manager"      exec pspice/msimmgrd
        Exec    "PSpice Schematics"   exec pspice/psched 

        Exec    "Mgr/Schematics" exec 'pspice/msimmgrd;pspice/psched'
EndPopup

I tried several combinations of 's and "s.  Can this be done by creating 
a "function?"?  A couple seconds wait might be needed, as the schematic 
editor won't start without the manager program.

Thanks,
Kevin

   OK, here's the report, testing with the included sample:
after making a minor change -- changing jball.xpm to one I
had -- the startup messages look fine, as far as they go.
They end with 'Creating windows...', and I don't get the
'OK' after it.  Also, an xclock is created, but nothing
further happens.

   I've tried removing the lines that swallow other programs
and get the same results, well, except for an xclock showing
up.  Also, FvwmButtons is eating all the CPU it can while
it's hanging.

   If a trace would really help, I can see if I can get it
to dump core in the morning.  Or, maybe that's enough.  Good
luck.  Even though I don't need any of the improvements, I'd 
like to see it work.

I think I'm going to cry.  :`{

I can't get it to work.  I applied all of Jarl's patches on my home
Linux box and it didn't do anything.

Here's my problems.

	#1 The Picture patch didn't work.  This is still no good.

IconPath /adm/arwild01/.icons
PixmapPath /adm/arwild01/.icons

AddToMenu Xterms "XTerms"       Title
+       ""                      Nop
+       "Local Xterm%starbase.xpm%"     Exec color_xterm -name starbase &

I know the icons are there.

	#2 The New FvwmButtons does not appear at all.  Some of the
child process are started.  Using Jarl's samplebuttonsrc, I got the
xclock -bg darkolivegreen . . . But it never lauched the xbiff from what
I can tell. 

The process *never* died.  It jsut never became visual.  It never
appeared in any win lists.  Nor did xlsclients list it.  

Here's the info from 110396b's start-up.

FvwmTest: Parsing...OK
FvwmTest: Shuffling...OK
FvwmTest: Loading data...

FvwmTest: Creating windows...

I hope this leads to some resolution.  I *really* want to use the new
FvwmButtons.  The changes looks outstanding, but I can't get it to work.
:`{

Note:  So far, I have tried Linux 1.2.13 and IBM AIX 3.2.5  I got
similiar behavior on both systems.

If it helps. . . 

Test system:

Linux 1.2.13
gcc 2.6.3
libc 4.6.27
Xfree86 3.1.2
Xpm 3.4.5

I remember some discussion about problems with Xpm revision numbers.
Could this be our "root of all evil"?

I'm sure that xsession (others suggested this) is a good solution, but
just for variety, I suggest using xlogout.

I'm not sure if xlogout comes with the standard X distribution -- it's
a program that opens a window and terminates when you click on it.

My .xsesssion file looks like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    ...start stuff...
    fvwm &
    exec xlogout

This way, you can enter an xterm, search for the pid of fvwm, then
enter this:

    kill 4242 ; sleep 5 ; olwm &

You can get back to fvwm similarly:

    kill 1717 ; sleep 5 ; fvwm &

(Assuming 4242 is the pid of fvwm, and 1717 is the pid of olwm.)

I'm having the same problems; I'm trying to run xdaliclock, xload, and
FvwmPager.  I get the unswallowed pager, but the clock & load never show up
(they *are* run -- I end up killing their processes later).  The only other
oddity is that Jarl's Buttons goes into an infinite loop(?) and eats mega
processor time until I kill it off.  I haven't looked into it too much (I
have two large senior projects going on), but I promise to try and track it
down to see where it chokes.  I'm also running 1.2.13, GCC 2.7.0; not sure
which Xpm (in case that should matter). 

I'd like to at least try out some of the new features !!

Hi All,

fvwm is definitely a seriously cool window manager, it's not EXACTLY
what I'm looking for, but it's pretty damn close!

Anyway, with all this discussion going on about MWM menus, I thought
I'ld drop in my few cents worth.

What I most miss in the FVWM menus, is the keyboard support. In mwm I
always had a character underlined in each menu entry, then, when I
poped up the menu from the keyboard, I could either cursor my way to
the option I want, or simply type the underlined character. If this is
possible in fvwm2, I haven't found it yet.

Also, when using the cursor keys in a menu, you have to use them a lot
more than with mwm. The cursor keys in fvwm move the pointer a certain
number of pixels, where as mwm moves the pointer to the next menu
entry. This is most obvious when moving to sub menus, where in fvwm
you have to hit cursor-right twice to get the pointer into the menu,
and once again to get from the menu title to the first menu option,
this is a single cursor-right keystroke in mwm.

If I've missed something please let me know (I've only been using fvwm
for a few weeks now).

By the way, I'm not using the mwm menu style, for exactly the reasons
stated in the other mails on this topic ;-)

It's still a great window manager though.

PS: What happened to the TogglePage (?) function? There are times when
I really don't want to page just because the pointer is at the edge of
the screen, but normally I do want this functionality, is it possible
to bind something like this to a key, so that hitting the key toggles
this? (Setting EdgeScroll is one way, but it doesn't toggle). Having a
little "Lock" icon appear somewhere on the screen when paging is
locked would also be a neat feature - anyone?

thanks in advance

Steve

Hi Kevin,

> programs?  I'm using fvwm 1.?

>         Exec    "Mgr/Schematics" exec 'pspice/msimmgrd;pspice/psched'

you're using Unix, so you've got to learn a few other ways to skin
a cat :-)

In this case, simply create a very small shell script, and run that,
you do have a directory for your own scripts etc don't you?

As an example:

--- cut here, File: start.schematics---
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/a/full/path/to/pspice:$PATH
export PATH
msimmgrd &
psched &
exit 0
--- cut here ---

then in fvwm:
	Exec "Mgr/Schematics" exec start.schematics &

you could also redirect output from the programs into seperate log
files, or any number of other things. I use a trick like this to get
around AIX's braindead Xterm, which forget to set the window size
properly when starting up.

Hope this helps,

Steve

Hi All,

I've got a pretty strange problem here, and it confuses the hell out
of me, now I'm hoping that someone else has seen / found a way around
it!

I'm running fvwm-2.0.41 on an RS6000 AIX 3.2.5 - but I only have a
XStation 160 on my desk, ie: I'm not working on the workstation
directly.

Anyway, when I start up, I can start a few Xterms via .xinit, but once
the session is running, I can't start Xterms from fvwm (This problem
also appeared with mwm by the way, but keep reading...) because the X
server dies, and I have to log in again. Here's an example of what I'm
doing in fvwm:

Key m		A	2	Exec exec xterm -name XTermMail -e elm & 

fairly simple stuff. And here's the bit that confuses me, when I start
it by hand, it works, if I try to start it with the key mapping above,
or via a menu, everything goes dark (black screen) and I get a shiny
new login prompt :-/ (same applies to any Xterms started this way)

I don't think its really a problem with fvwm, but I can't explain why
it crashes when started from the window manager, and not when started
by hand.

Has anyone encountered this before??


And just to add spice to it all, after I've been working for a few
hours, then it magically starts working from the window manager as
well, but I can't figure out what event causes the switch, I normally
try at about lunch time, and sometimes it works, sometimes not, and
once it works, it keeps on working for the whole day!

Any tips greatly appreciated.

Thanks for listening :-)


thanks in advance
Steve

While working through the code, failing to find the problem, I got a mail
from Romano Giannetti, basically telling me he found these two references
to the variable xname only:
  XTextProperty xname;
  XFree(xname.value);
What can I say? Patched version will be out in half an hour.

Well, thanks a lot to Romano for tracing down the bugger, I hope this will
be the end to major problems with FvwmButtons for now.. until I make another
typo or absentminded modification. Somebody stop me. :-)

Ehm, Fvwm.tmpl is not a part of FvwmButtons... apart from the sample
config file there are now different files in the two versions... Am I
missing something here?

Vyrdsamt,

Hi! Debugging Jarl's FvwmButtons I discovered a feature  of
fvwm2 ... :-) if you specify a color in the form rgb:a/b/c and then 
make a typo like

IconStyle "*" BackColor rgb:/60/50/60 

(note the first bogus '/') the fvwm2 manager die without a word :-), 
spent one hour to find it... it's my setup?

Hey, fvwm2 with the superbuttons is really NEAT. Great WM, thanks to all 
developers. 

Bye,
	Romano.

This isn't exactly on an fvwm topic.
I abandoned using Sun's File Manager long ago but other users like
a file manager rather than using the shell. Fair enough. 
Fvwm interacts badly with sun tools, especially in some preferences
windows.

People here recommended I just switch over to using xfm, today I got
our site manager to install it properly (much handier!).
However its more or less up to me to get it work 'right'.

There are a few problems...and as people here recommended it I reckoned
I should ask you lot first, I'm not actually sure if fvwm is implicated
or not yet. When I start it the file viewer is four virtual screens tall!

And won't resize itself to fit what is in it. Using -geometry affects the
size of the apps manager. How can I get it to start in (a) a small window
with scroll bars I can use (rather than a big window with a big scrollbar!)
and (b) preferably in icon mode.

Any help appreciated, if patches advised please include a site.
(I have asked on comp.windows.x.apps but our newsfeed is flakey.)

I seem to remember this exact same problem when I first compiled
2.0.39 on IRIX 6.0.1. I left it alone for a few days, came back and recompiled
and this time it worked. I might have got some different compiler
options, but I don't know what, I'm afraid.

I now have a working 2.0.40 on IRIX 6.1 which also runs under 5.3.
I'll have a go with 2.0.41 later this week if I get a minute.

If you continue to have problems give me a shout and I'll see what I can do.

Hi all. 

   I'd like to ask if there is a program that is able to reduce 
the colors of a pixmap to a given set of, for example, another 
pixmap? It should not be difficult to do ... but I have no time and 
probably someone have something better yet (I tried with netpbm but
the pixmap part is quite old, and masks and transparency are difficult 
to manage).

   Thanks,
		Romano.

I, personally, think netpbm is your best bet.  Well, that, some shell
scripts, and vi.

When I want to do this, I intentionally set all of the Transparencies to
some color that isn't being used by any if the pixmaps.  I use a simple
shell script and sed for this.

Then I apply netpbm's utilities and then convert back.

I'll agree this isn't the best solution, but it does work for me.

If you find something better, please share it.

Seems like you have a missing .fvwm2rc file
                                  ---

Did you #define rename Fvwm2 ?? I had the same problem the first time
I installed it

Not to be rude.  :)

Fvwm 2.0 uses a .fvwm2rc file.  The system file presently also has to be
known as .fvwm2rc.  I would recommend, stronly, that you do not rely on
the system file.  Unless you are maintaining fvwm2 for a multi-user
system, just use your .fvwm2rc in your home directory.

The next pre-release should go to a more standard system naming
convention such as system.fvwm2rc.

Right Chuck?

Subject: FVWM: Red Hat RPM of 2.40?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

Hi,

I installed RH 2.1 this weekend. It came with 1.24 but I wanted to use
2.xx. I was visiting red hat's ftp site and found what appears to be an RPM
of 2.40. Does anybody know anything about this?

I ftp'd it and installed it but it seems to put an old style .fvwmrc file
on my disk. I guess I should say that I am not convinced that infact this
is 2.40 because it does not seem to digest my new style .fvwmrc file (as
.fvwmrc or as .fvwm2rc) It gives me screens and screens of errors and none
of the stuff in the config file seem to have effect.

Is there some way I can invoke it to get it to tell me the version?

Thanks,
-Greg

fvwm[2] -version? :-)

I'm familiar with that rpm, I had a bad experience with it when I first 
wanted to install fvwm2. I don't think it comes with any of the modules, 
and I don't know what version it really is, but it seemed very messed up 
to me.

Not to be rude.  :)

Fvwm 2.0 uses a .fvwm2rc file.  The system file presently also has to be
known as .fvwm2rc.  I would recommend, stronly, that you do not rely on
the system file.  Unless you are maintaining fvwm2 for a multi-user
system, just use your .fvwm2rc in your home directory.

The next pre-release should go to a more standard system naming
convention such as system.fvwm2rc.

Right Chuck?

Hi,

I am running fvwm 2.0.39 and tkgoodstuff 4.1b6.  Whenever I click on the 
Pager Client for tkgoodstuff or the FvwmPager client, the screen changes to 
the new screen and the cursor moves to the upper left hand corner of the 
first window opened on that screen.  The only way that I have found to 
defeat this feature is to set ClickToFocus on the Style for "*".  I want 
the focus to go to where the cursor is without clicking and without the 
cursor moving to the upper left hand corner of a window when Pager is used. 
 Any suggestions?

The ImageMagick utilities have good support for pixmaps and darn near

G'day,
a few questions on fvwm 2.0.41:

- Is my impression correct that fvwm does not use any Xresources?

- is there a way to influence the way the border reliefs are drawn?
  Something analogous to `activeBottomShadowColor/activeTopShadowColor' 
  in mwm?  I'd like the top-shadow a bit lighter than it is now...
  
- is there a way to specify the cursor shape?  I noted in the FAQ that
        Cursor  cursor_num cursor_type             (obsoleted)
  Is there any replacement for it or is this feature just dumped?
  I can't stand the cursor changing its shape like a maniac if I move
  the mouse around.  It should be top_left_arrow and that's it.

Regards
R'

Hi,

I am in the middle of compiling FVWM 2.0.41 on an IRIX 5.3
platform. Everything seems fine except for one thing. The Fvwm.tmpl allows
me to specify where my Xpm library and include files are found. I need to
do this because they are installed with ViewKit in /usr/include/Vk/xpm.h.
The astute will realize that xpm.h is not in an X11 directory like normal
on this platform. This means that when I tell the .tmpl file where to find
my xpm.h file, the compiler still can't find it because the source code
tries to include the file in an X11 directory. Here is an excerpt

#ifdef XPM
#include <X11/xpm.h>
#endif /* XPM */

Oh, I just check the compiler status. There are some illegal
pointer/integer combinations in FvwmForm.c. Here is the output for those
that might be interested (sorry to waste other peoples time.)

Appears to conflict. m4 reported unterminated calls until I changed
the wrapped lines to long ones.

M4 used instead of Cpp because on Solaris /some/path/USER expanded
to /some/path/ user with a leading space. No idea why.

The problem is that Event.type is 64, but EventHandlerJumpTable has only
35 members:

  (gdb) p Event.type
  $1 = 64
  (gdb) ptype EventHandlerJumpTable
  type = void (*[35])()
  (gdb) p EventHandlerJumpTable[Event.type]
  $2 = (void (*)()) 0x1

Obviously indirecting through 0x1 is not good!

I don't know what the problem is here: should Event.type never be >34?
Should EventHandlerJumpTable be larger than it is?

At any rate, some sanity checking of this value would probably be A Good
Thing.

Correct.  All initialization is done through the rc file.

Actually this is a partial lie, it does check to see if an app has an

Not currently.  You could try playing with GetShadow and GetHilite in

anything like this, but I may put it on the TO-DO list as a maybe.

I set the size of that to be LASTEvent, which is defined in X.h to be
of a greater value than any of the events.  Apparently on your
machine, this is not the case.  I could set it to something like 256
always, but I wanted to save space.  Besides, LASTEvent is SUPPOSED to
be the max event number...

Possibly, but I took out the checking that was there (the switch
statement) to get a speedup.  As I said, I could extend the size of
the jump table to like 256 and still get that speedup, but waste that
extra space (even if it is only about 888 bytes).

Perhaps I'll have do that...

Who knows; could be any number of problems.  Never seen it in any

Agreed; in both X11R5 and X11R6 (note these are straight from MIT; we
build them locally from the public sources) that value is 35, and there
are only 35 events listed (0 to 34).

So it seems to be a bug in the X server, or the tgif code, or fvwm, or
_something_ that lets a value of 64 get into that variable; it shouldn't
hold values that high.

I'll try recompiling tgif and see if it breaks after that.

   I had first tried 110396 at work, and I got the message
about 110396b while I was at home.  It turns out I was only
on fvwm-2.0.40 at home.  I've upgraded, patched, and am now
running 120396 here at home, and it's fine.  I doubt I'll
have any troule at work, either.

   fvwm-popup.patch so far has my vote for best improvement,
although I haven't begun to play.

A relief is (currently) composed of three parts: top shadow, base,
bottom shadow (talking about a horizontal structure.  Vertical...well
you get it.)  It would be nice to specify the three colors distinctly,
something absolute or even relative to the normal background of the
struct.  I.e. top-shadow is +#0a0a0a (meaning R+10 G+10 B+10 relative
to the normal BG).  If the color was without sign, it is absolute, '-'
specifies a darker color.  Plus of course the sizes for these
structs.  If I have a large border, I also need larger shadows.

Definitely useful.

Maybe 'CursorStyle' patch made by Kit Smithers is a good starting

Hi All,

I noticed yesterday that fvwm on NetBSD behaves differently than fvwm
on AIX (I don't have any other machines to test it on).

Anyway, I've got the following key mappings:

Key Left    A	2	Prev [ CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !iconic ] focus
Key Right   A	2	Next [ CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !iconic ] focus

on AIX, these keys warp me from one window to another, without leaving
the current screen (I've got other keymaps to jump between screens).
Hitting these keys repeatedly cycles between the windows, so if I
happen to go in the wrong direction, I can keep going and still get to
my destination (normally I only have 2-3 windows on a screen, so
cycling like this is perfect)

On NetBSD (1.1 on an Amiga) it doesn't cycle, instead, it get's to the
end of the list and stops, so I waste a bunch of keystrokes if I go in
the wrong direction, since I first have to move at least once too
often to find out that I've hit the end of the list, and then I've got
to back up through the whole list to get to the window I wanted (or
I've got to grappel for the mouse).

Has anyone else noticed something like this? The sources used to
compile the two versions were identicle - the imake configurations and
compilers were of course different, but this looks like completely
different code.

Steve

I try to compile the new FvwmButtons (Decstation 5000/25 with X11R4 gcc 2.7)
the output is :
gcc -o FvwmButtons FvwmButtons.o icons.o misc.o parse.o output.o 
button.o  -O2 -L../../
libs -lfvwm2 -L/usr/tmp/xpm-3.4h/lib -lXpm

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/ld:
Undefined:
XmbSetWMProperties
*** Error code 1

This function XmbSetWMProperties is not present in X11R4 !!

Maybe the wonderful new FvwmButtons is only for X11R5 and X11R6 ??

(I think that the solution is to drop XmbSetWMProperties and replace with 
XSetWMProperties)

Thanks for the great work Jarl !!!

Hups, sorry for this one... I guess should check more thoroughly before I
clean out old code.

Absolutely, that was what was there before. 

I've restored it to it's proper state now. Coincidentally, I had to put back
in the XFree that gave you all such trouble :-) Not to worry, it now has a
purpose.

Hey, that's what I do. :-)

Mmm, the patch is a patch to the Read function only, thus acts on what
is already preprocessed by FvwmCpp or M4. Should not make any problems
for them.

Note that this means you cannot continue preprocessor lines this way,
i.e. this is illegal: (cpp)

  #define ICONS /usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps\
:HOME/include/X11/pixmaps:HOME/gfx/icons

Here ICONS would get defined as the first line, up to and including the
backslash, whereas the second line would cause fvwm some headache.

> M4 used instead of Cpp because on Solaris /some/path/USER expanded

Fwiw, I've heard about cpp's that only accepts one character of whitespace
between the defined name and its definition, if there were more it would
be included in the definition. You might want to check that there are no
more than one space or tab after USER in "#define USER user", if there
were two it could get defined as " user".

You probably meant

But the reason why I'm responding to this is that our former sysadmin
did this sort of thing whenever a file could not be found where it was
being looked for.  In a 3-year period, he eventually got our system
linked up the yin-yang, and we are still straightening it out, 2 years
later.

Yep.  I would also not recommend fiddling in the system directories.
It's a nightmare to straighten out things if you ever have to upgrade.
Why not do in the fvwm source directory:

(cd fvwm assumed and `uname -s` = IRIX :-)

# xpm in /usr/include/Vk/
[ -d libs/X11 ] || ( mkdir libs/X11; ln -s /usr/include/Vk/xpm.h libs/X11/xpm.h )

Exactly.  And most of it was due to some "...PATH" environment variable
not being set correctly.  In all fairness, though, I must admit that our
sysadmin did a brilliant job of getting our heterogeneous network of
sun3's, sun4's, and decstations all talking to each other.  And we have
some semi-amazing dot files that allow us to do anything (almost) on any
machine.  He was really jammed-up for time, and took a lot of short
cuts.  We bought a mix of workstations because our management was
familiar with Unix already, and they were convinced that "Unix is Unix".
Hoo boy.

It's always better to find out why it doesn't work on one's system (if
you can) to start fiddling around with the system directories.  Not only
does it make a nightmare of upgrades, but it can create a situation
where the wrong versions of some other files are found because after
awhile the file tree starts to become short-circuited by all the short
cuts. 

Not to knock the original poster.  I would have done what he suggested,
actually.  :-)

secondly how could I bind every thing so that fvwm doesn't interfere with motif applications?



Also is it possible to specify a set geometry that you want FvwmTalk to default to and to always start at no matter how crowded the screen is?

Graeme

p.s. has anyone provided the resize routine for xpm yet?

The other night I changed my window titlebar somewhat, I now have the 
following two buttons on the right hand side: Maximize (4), Resize (2).
Using MWMButtons I thought I would get button 4 to look pressed when the
window was maximized, but no - it turns out this behaviour is hardcoded
to button 2, so when I maximize my window, the resize button is inverted.

Actually it turns out the MWM stuff is hardwired to work with 
button 1 as menu, button 2 as maximize and button 4 as minimize.

I guess this could be figured out dynamically, like the shading of
the menu, by parsing the actions performed by each button to see
which are which, and also to provide the 'pressed-look' on maximize
button.

Another neat thing would be to be able to get this depressed behaviour
on other buttons, like a Stick/Unstick button that is depressed when the
window is sticky... I guess this would have to be set in the ButtonStyle,
but as I haven't tested the pxp2 patch I'm not really uptodate on the 
syntax of this. Btw, does the patch also handle bitmaps?

Just some general thoughts.

Oh and btw, there is a new FvwmButtons out :-)

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Hi,

In addition to the idea of Jarl, I suggest that for every titlebar button,
another ButtonStyle is specified. So one for unpressed situation and one
for the pressed situation. That way, you are not limited to `looking pressed',
`looking unpressed'.

A symbolic name for ButtonStyles might not be a bad idea, maybe.

Greetz, Micha

Hi,

I have this problem with menus (I mean the widget). If I click on the button
that popups the menu, it popsup the menu, but then immediately the menuwindow
is put behind the parent window. You have to click somewhere else, to unmap
the menu window and activate the menuwindow again. (Very strangely it stays
in front of the parent window, the second time). I have this both with Motif 
and Athena.

I this a problem (bug) in the window manager (fvwm2) or something else?

This is not possible... unless you swallow it in a button :-)

Perhaps I can put in checking .fvwmrc for a geometry line?

Howdy all,

Just thought I'd let you know that Jason has done something which I'm
sure people have been eagerly awaiting - the mailing list is now
archived and available on line via an HTML form!  It has search
capabilities and shows the subject threads too.

I've just put pointers to it in the official home page (in the Mailing
List and Docs sections).

Jason says that he has a little more work to do on it, but that it
should be useful as is, and I wholeheartedly agree.

So, everyone take a look.  It should be helpful!

(Thanks Jason!)

Later,
Chuck

Just so you all know, I have a new module here called FvwmConsole
(written by Toshi Isogai) which is basically a replacement for
FvwmTalk (taking care of some of the FvwmTalk related things on the
TO-DO list as well).

It's got editing and history capabilities, and runs under an XTerm.

I'm still playing with it and plan to put it in the next release.
So I don't know if you want to bother working on FvwmTalk.

Chuck,

I'm on that list twice (or so I surmize since I always receive two copies of
your mail), can I remove one entry in the conventional manner (unsubscribing)
or will that remove me entirely?

The URL for the official FVWM web site (http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/)
is at the bottom of all of the mailing list notes:

>>>>>> Visit the official FVWM web page at <URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/>.

which is why I didn't put it in my note originally.  I was just being

Before venturing into the frozen wasteland of xmodmap, I suggest getting
the excellent ATV called xkeycaps, by Jamie Zawinski.  It will navigate
you safely through the pitfalls.  Get it from:

  ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/

somewhere.  Have fun!

Organization: Institute for Perception Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands
X-Url: http://www.tue.nl/ipo
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I have two popups defined on the root window for mouse-1 and mouse-2.
At the lower edge of the screen is 1 cm space between an say xterm and
the lower edge of the screen.  In this area I press mouse-button 1 and
the menu pops up.  Ooops, I wanted to pop up the mouse-button 2 menu.
Release button, press button 2.

BUT: when popping up menu 1, the pointer moves to the top of the menu
since there was not enough space to pop up the menu below the pointer.
AND the pointer stays there after releasing the button, which means
that the mouse-2 does not click on the root window, but in the xterm
(assuming the menu is taller than 1cm).  Can give you quite
interesting results (provided mouse-2 in the xterm is bound to its
default action to yank the selection).

I'd say, the mouse pointer should either go back to the origin of the
click if I did not move the mouse during a pop-up (or even generally go
back, regardless of movement during popup), or it should not move to
the popup-top in the first place.

A completely different subject: How about grepping the `Subject:' lines
in the mail archive into some Index-Archive-03-96.gz files?

Subject: FVWM: [2.0.41] still coring using tgif
Reply-To: psmith@BayNetworks.com
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

OK, I pulled the very latest tgif 2.16-p12 and it still causes FVWM to
core in exactly the same way.

It turns out that the only time tgif causes a core is _after_ I've
resized the tgif window.  I played with tgif for about 10 mins without a
problem, then I resized the window (by dragging the right FVWM border)
and very quickly after that FVWM cored.  I then started tgif and
immediately resized the border, and again FVWM cored very shortly
afterward.  Note you must actually be fooling around in tgif, if you
don't do anything it won't core.

I'm not 100% sure but it might have happened the first time I moved the
mouse outside of the tgif window after resizing.

I have no tgif resources set personally, and tgif doesn't install any
system ones either.

I'm using X11R6 fix 12 from MIT on SunOS 4.1.3_U1.  I've recompiled FVWM
and tgif to use the X11R6 libs and headers; ldd shows:

  $ ldd tgif 
        -lXext.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.4.20
        -lX11.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.4.20
        -lc.1 => /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9
        -ldl.1 => /usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0
  $ ldd fvwm2
        -lXpm.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.8
        -lXext.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.4.20
        -lX11.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.4.20
        -lc.1 => /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9
        -ldl.1 => /usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0

I'm not sure where to go from here: could this be a bug in FVWM?  Could
that event number get trashed somehow by FVWM before it's used?  Or is
that value take directly from the X API, and this is a bug in X?

Ok, I admit I'm not sure where the 'rgb:r/g/b' style begins and '#rgb' ends,
what I know is that on the X11R5 and R6 on the machines I have access to 
right now (suns and sgis) the X man page describes the '#rgb' style thus:

man X:
>     For backward compatibility, an older syntax for  RGB  Device

So there are probably cases where this is not supported, but I should
imagine XFree was plenty uptodate...

OK, it turns out that resizing absolutely _any_ X application, then
moving the mouse outside the window will cause FVWM to core with the
same problem: Event.type is 64 and you get a core dump.  I tried it with
Netscape, xterm, etc. and all did the same thing.

Note that if the memory after that array happens to be NULL, you won't
see anything go wrong; the event will just be ignored.  So at least when
you're debugging FVWM, be sure to add a check for this or you might
think it doesn't happen on your system.

PS. Someone mentioned a way to create a "pseudo display" on your normal
    display that you can use to start and debug another FVWM process; I
    looked at ftp.x.org and found xpseudoroot-1.04 which looks
    promising, but I can't get it to compile, even after toying with the
    makefile and fixing a reference to dpy->display_name (changed to
    DisplayString(dpy)), because it uses the functions LockMutex and
    UnlockMutex which I can't find anywhere on my system.

    I tried searching through the FVWM mailing list archives but
    couldn't find anything about it.

    Is there a newer version of xpseudoroot or another app that does the
    same thing?

Well... thanks for all the nice advices, but really I did not like 
to install some giant image elaboration package for this... so, I made a 
little program that seem to work. This is the README:

******************
This is a little stupid program to reduce the number of colors
of a pixmap set.
Use:

   pixy [-v] base.xpm icon.xpm > newicon.xpm

after this magic, newicon.xpm will have its color changed to the
nearer one of base.xpm. Next, if you want to get rid of duplicate
colormap entries, do a

   sxpm -nod appl2.xpm -o appl3.xpm

and you have it.

Enjoy! 
**********************

... well, it is really an hack and it control almost nothing on 
correctness of parameters etc etc... so keep attention. I have used 
it one hour without problems. 

find it on: 
		ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy.tar.gz

No version number because I really do not know if I'll like to support 
and/or improve it.

Bye,
	Romano.

%% Regarding FVWM: [2.0.41] fvwm core on bad Event.type; I wrote:

Ugh.  Sorry for the glut of email :(

Anyway, I added some code to check for bogus Event.type values in both
events.c:DispatchEvent() _and_ in events.c:My_XNextEvent(), right after
the XNextEvent() function returns.

It turns out that the Event.type==64 is happening fairly regularly,
every 30 seconds or so, and it's being returned that way from
XNextEvent().  It happens even if I don't resize the window... even if I
just let my mouse sit idle.

And I found the culprit: xfaces!  Every time xfaces polls for mail it
does something with its window that generates that event.

I recompiled FVWM to catch that event type and ignore it; then xfaces
didn't quite work: when I had no mail I got the proper shaped mailbox
pixmap.  When I received some mail, it tried to put up a square bitmap,
but the shape of the bitmap was still the mailbox shape (i.e., it still
looked like a mailbox but it was "filled in" with the mail sender's
icon).

I don't understand why it works sometimes and core dumps other times;
very odd.  Even more strange is that if I add a test so it doesn't core,
xfaces doesn't reshape correctly as I mentioned above!  It's almost like
there's _normally_ some valid function pointer at location
EventHandlerJumpTable[64] that makes things work, but it gets
overwritten by 1 every now and then.

My xfaces app _was_ compiled a long time ago, with older X and Xpm
libraries; ldd says:

        -lXpm.4 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXpm.so.4.2
        -lXaw.5 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXaw.so.5.0
        -lXmu.4 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXmu.so.4.10
        -lXt.4 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXt.so.4.10
        -lXext.4 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXext.so.4.10
        -lX11.4 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libX11.so.4.10
        -lc.1 => /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9
        -ldl.1 => /usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0

I suppose that might be part of the problem.  I'll recompile and see if
there's any difference.

Dan Espen also wrote a similar program (which I meant to mention the
other day when this thread came up) that I was planning on putting
into the next release in the utils directory (if it's ok with him - I
don't recall if I asked him yet or not).  I also plan on using his to
reduce some of the included pixmaps too (sometime).

I'll put yours in there too, if you'd like.

No problem.  Sorry it gave you such grief - I should have caught this
before I sent it out.  I'm going try to compile it under SunOS or
Solaris and check it w/ Purify to make sure I didn't do anything else
silly like this...

Yes, XFree86 is very "uptodate".  The latest release is 3.1.2D (a public
beta release). It was made available at the end of February and is based
on X11R6.1 which hasn't even been released to the public by the X
Consortium yet (although it will be RSN).

It is "SUPPOSED" to be the max CORE event number.  Extensions that generate
events are assigned numbers too.

First Jarl keep up the good work! Buttons is getting better all the
time, by the way I tried mailling you the other day on
jatotal@stud.unit.no but the mail bounced


Now my question

I have a Sun IPC with a mono screen, and the background on the buttons
just appears white. Can you suggest any setting for FvwmButtonsBack
that will appear. By the way I really like the CDE-alike version on
your web page

At last !! Stop lurking and actually try and help someone.

There is lots of information and pictures about CDE at
http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/solaris/cde/index.html

Hope this helps.

X11R6 has a server called Xnest which is implemented using Xlib calls
(wierd!!). This has the effect that if you run it you get a window which
is itself another X server you can connect to and a start new sessions
etc. without losing your main session.

Well, I could not resist... 

I have modified the program pixy.c in two way: now you have a 
function, distance(...), where you can play  and where I convert 
too rgb value into hvc: I noted that simply computing color distances 
with plain hvc euclidian distances give a choose of color more 
pleasant to the eye (this is equivalent to give more importance to hue 
than to saturation or luminosity). Now it tend to tranform the pixmap
set in one that is a bit more brilliant... 

If you like it you have to thanks Dan Espen too... without his mails, 
pixy2 would not exist.

Take it from: 
              ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy2.tar.gz

I'm open to better distance() routines. 

Ah. I have added a script that find all the icons you name in .fvwm2rc
and reduce their color, putting the new ones in the current directory. 
***********WARNING************* use it in a directory **different***
from the one where your icons stay... or you'll lose the original ones.

bye,
	Romano.

Hi,
   I have just started looking at convering to fvwm2 and I am very please
with it. But I do have a small bug to report. It happens when I try to
start an application iconic and also specify where to place the icon

For example

 xterm  -xrm  '*iconGeometry: +940+0' -iconic 


fvwm2 first places the icon ar (0,0) then moves it to the required location
(940,0). However if the location (0,0) is completely obscured by another
window fvwm2 does not move the icon to the required location until the
icon at (0,0) is exposed in some way, like closing the window which
is obscuring it.

I tracked this to a line of code in events.c, here is a patch which fixes
the problem by initially placing the icon at the wmhints location instead of
(0,0)

Graham.

Hi all,

I using fvwm version 2.0.40.  The fvwm man page (for this version) mentions 
both OpaqueResize and SaveUnders in the Style section.

In my .fvwmrc, I have the line:

	Style "*"           OpaqueResize, SaveUnders

but every time I start Fvwm, the following line appears in my .xsession-errors 
file:

	fvwm: bad style command: OpaqueResize, SaveUnders


Any ideas at to why this isn't working?

Thanks,
Eric.

Yup - because they don't really exist.  The man page in 2.0.41 doesn't
have them (I made a lot of corrections then).

They may reappear in the future, after the 'Great Style Flag Rewrite'
that I have planned for shortly after the first official release.

Chuck, Romano takes   the same approach  to  color reduction that   my
program did, but he did a better job of it.   I would suggest that you
only include Romano's version.

I don't think either of us has worked out what set  of colors the xpms
should be reduced to using.  If anyone else on the  list has some good
ideas about how  the subset  of colors should  be determined  I know I
would be interested.

Xnest is the more general solution, but under Linux, many people don't
realize that you can start additional X sessions on other virtual consoles. 
You do need the proper command line switch to tell X that it's display :1
for example - I just tried it with:

startx -- :1

and sure enough, a second X server started up using another VC and a second
copy of fvwm, xclock, etc.

Linux isn't the only Unix-style OS with virtual consoles.  There's
also FreeBSD, eSix, Interactive SVR4, and Solaris, to name a few.  But
no other non-Intel based Unix that I know has it.  Curious.

Anyone know what the deal is?  Why haven't other vendors implemented
similar technology?

There are rs6000 AIX boxes here that have virtual consoles.

Hello !

I've hacked FvwmWinList and Win95look to produce a new module : a button
bar of active windows. The focused one is depressed and you can hide or
raise any window in a mouse click.

My main goal was to provide a quick way to retrieve an application's
window, especially iconised one.
Besides, I added a status window with a digital clock and an incoming
mail icon. It awfully looks like the MS-thing, but I found it usefull.
I also added support for 'swallowing' windows, but it still needs
improvements. In fact, I preferred to incorporate applets like the
clock, instead of spawning a new process. It's less customisable, but
more efficient (IMHO) on a small machine like mine.

I'm very interested in your suggestions/remarks.

You can upload the source at http://ltiwww.epfl.ch/~barth and see
screenshots of the beast.

The current version works well with the 1.24r version, but seems to
bug with the new 2.4 : i'll work on that asap.

Best regards

The file must be named .fvwm2rc and it must be an fvwm2.0.x specific
file.  You cannot use your old 1.x files with fvwm2.  Although you can
use the conversion script that comes distribute with fvwm2 to translate
your old file to the new syntax/

Personally, I would rather code a new file.  There are so many new
features and options that fvwm 1.x based setup seems rather obsolete to
me.

Especially now that I have started to play with Jarl's new FvwmButtons.
It's really impressive.

Too bad that fvwm warp's your pointer to the top of menus.  Chuck?  :)

What is Win95Look? Is it related to bowman?

Please do. The screenshots look really interesting.

Hello,

I have used this Double-Click-Action, which is given in a 
Menu bringing-up command, like this:

AddToMenu panelSystem "*DtBldr.m.pm*" Title
+                     "&Desktop"      Menu panelDesktop
+                     "&Micha"        Menu panelDeskMicha Desk 0 fvwm_Desk_Micha
+                     "M&onitor"      Menu panelDeskMonitor Desk 0 fvwm_Desk_Monitor

where fvwm_Desk_Micha and fvwm_Desk_Monitor are preprocessor defined. 
But it won't work:
When I double click on the menu-item "&Micha", it just doesn't go to the right desk.

Does anyone know if this is a bug, or if I'm doing something wrong?

Greetz, Micha <michah@htsa.hva.nl>

Well, sort of : bowman's page has a link to a Win95look package, but
I don't know exactly the relations between the two. Neither do I know if
win95look is still maintained as the author didn't answer to my post.
Who knows ?

I think that you'll want the pointer to be warped in most cases.
Otherwise it might be in the middle of the menu, and activate a sub
menu (if the position is right) that you didn't want to access, which
would be annoying.

That feature annoys me from time to time, but for a different reason
and in a different circumstance.  Trying to double click on a titlebar
button menu when the window is far enough down on the screen to make
the menu shift up and hence warp the pointer, which then selects the
first menu item instead of doing the double click action.  I plan to
fix this, but this has to do with how to properly distinguish between
a click, double click, and motion, not really with warping the
pointer.

         _________
         |       |
         |       |
         |       |
_________|_______|_____________________________________________________
|        |* |  |  |  |  |                                             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

But I want my pointer to stay where the asterisk is.  I don't want it
instantly warped to the top.  Basically, Fvwm already does this with
Pull-downs on Windows.  I just want the same to apply to a pull-up
started from a module (such as FvwmButtons).

Only this.  I have two lines in my .Xdefaults for netscape because it
was stealing colors from my other apps, especially the screen saver, but
other stuff as well.  I don't know how it's implemented in netscape, or
how it's related, but maybe fvwm could use some similar approach.  (It
doesn't seem to make netscape any less colorful to limit it to 64
colors, BTW.)

   ! make sure netscape only uses 64 colors
   Netscape*installColormap:	No
   Netscape*maxImageColors:	64

The defaults for XFree86 Are:

Ctrl-Alt +F?

Where '?' is the number of the consoel you want to use.  F7 is used for
X.  I believe if you are using xdm, there is a virtual console attached
to 6, as well.

Well... so the solution could be: warp to title *but* add the option
to have the title *last* in the popup. I do not have idea if this is
simple/difficult/already working :-).

And Jarl's FvwmButtons works perfectly here. Hope this will be in the
next beta (with line continuation patch, too: really handy).

Yes, but netscape do dithering (I think) and in big images it is 
perfect doing so. I tried reducing color in icons with netpbm, but in 
very little images, with strenght color contrast, results are, well,
not so good. Then if I remember well those lines limit the colormap mosaic 
uses in included images, _not_ in pixmap it is using to display buttons 
etc... (nice trick :-) so it look right. 

I tried reducing my whole iconset to 16 colors (the same 20) and it look
quite good for almost all the icons. Almost :-). With 32 colors, if the
subset is good, I think it will look good.

Well, I would like to see a few more bug releases first, but I agree.  I
did have a buggy-situation where his FvwmButtons geometry popper up at
about 2024x1000.  I have no idea what caused it.  (We run AIX 3.2.5)

The same exact setup at home on my Linux box is workign quite well now.

I think the new features are great and I really like them.

In fact, using this in conjuntion with my FvwmPagerDeskColor patch makes
for some really interesting effects.

I hope they both make the next release.  *cheesy grin*

Yes, still there are some buglets here and there (no one with a "pressed
FvwmPager" over there :-)?) but they are few and for me absolutely no 
show stoppers. For geometry, I had something similar when putting a "Size 
x" and not "Size x y" option to a Swallow button... garbage in, garbage 
out :-).

For the all fvwm2 thing, I think that one time the 
motion/click/doubleclick/edgeresistance nasty interaction is resolved,
the all thing will be *perfect*. 

Ah, by the way... I have a strange bug. I have MenuStyle fvwm, and it 
happen to me the following: clicking on the menu on the titlebutton1,
keep pressed, move to a "close" action, release. Window (e.g a xcalc) 
close, BUT pointer keep the "dot" form and you can do nothing but 
cliking somewhere, fvwm2 beeps and apparently no operation is taken.

Linux 1.2.13, a.out, fvwm2.0.41 w linecont,module popup,bitmap search 
patch from Jarl.

Later,
	Romano.

That only gets you from X to some other console.  To get back to X use
Alt F? where '?' is the first virtual console that doesn't
have a getty running on it.  For me, that's 5---getty is running on
the first 4.

Of course, there are probably other strange setups where this is not
true.  I'd just try pressing Alt F? for all values of ? until X comes
back.

Nice to know there's another one who has this bug (I guess). I don't find 
that changing MenuStyles helps, and I can get it when I'm closing just 
about any window. (For example, run netscape, press alt+f to bring up 
search dialog box, then enter to start search, and I get the "dot".) 

Please, could anyone who has this problem send me your .fvwm2rc? I'm pretty 
sure some setting in there is the cause, I'm trying to find out just *what*.

To go from X to commandline:
CTRL-ALT-F1 for the first "virtual" terminal, F2 for the second, etc.

To go from commandline to X:
ALT-F7 for the first "virtual" terminal, F8 for the second, etc.

(or is it CTRL-ALT-F7?  I'm not on my console, so i can't doublecheck)

It's not an FVWM setting, it's a bug in FVWM itself.  Some kind of
timing issue.  I get this occasionally as well closing windows.

This was discussed just recently (last week?) on the mailing list, and
someone suggested a fix which involved adding a wait somewhere.  I
forget the details, but you should be able to find it in the FVWM
mailing list archives.

Waaah! :-(

Sorry for being absent today, but cptsu1 finally gave its last breath,
taking with it the last work done on FvwmButtons and also the setup and
programs and stuff I've made the last 6 months.

So today I have been busy compiling elm and fvwm on a Solaris 2 system,
with no imake and the X11 hierarchy under /opt/xc... Now all I need is
patch and I'm back in business.. No, no X11 programs are installed here,
just the headers and the libs (somewhat). 

Pity about that latest FvwmButtons, it had working pixmaps as background
to buttons, not perfect with the relief yet, but very NextStep'ish...
Hmm, I can't remember exactly what bugfixes I had done, but if you have
asked for a bugfix after v130396 please send me a new mail with it.

I looked at the output you send me, probably some uninitialized variables
somewhere. I'll look at it.

I need to catch the x event that is generated when the upper left button on the
window is clicked.  I need to do cleanup before the process that opened the window
exits.  If this is documented, would someone indicate where and if not, how da you
do it?

thanks

Hello all,

I've haven't been watching this list very closely so maybe this question
has been answered but I would appreciate it if someone would answer this
again:

I have had FvwmWinList running on my FVWM for some time now. And for
some time now I have noticed (and been slightly irritated) at its
behavior of creeping across (and off) the screen as I exit and enter
apps. Can anybody help me stop this?

I am use FVWM 2.0.40.
I am invoking the module FvwmWinList with no arguments in the .fvwmrc
file. My settings looks like this:

Style "*" BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, Color lightblack/lightblue,Icon
\ unknown1.xpm, IconBox -150 1 -120 -140
Style "FvwmWinList" NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip,NoHandles
*FvwmWinListBack #908090
*FvwmWinListFore Black
*FvwmWinListFont -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1,Focus
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry +1-1

This initially puts the window list in the bottom left hand corner where
I would like it to stay. Can anybody help?

(I just subscribed yesterday.)

Could someone tell or point me to how to use FvwmTalk?  An
example from a .fvwm2rc file would do just fine I guess.

I read the amusing man page and flicked through the source, but
that was not really enough for me.

Thanks, Jens

I tried starting fvwm2 with

fvwm2 -blackout -f "FvwmM4 -m4prog /usr/5bin/m4 -m4opt -Uinclude .fvwm2rc"

But this gives me the error:

	fvwm: No such module /home/petersen/lib/X11/fvwm2 include(.fvwm2rc)

and starts up fvwm2 without my .fvwm2rc file.

I guess I should just undefine include in my .fvwm2rc file, but
any ideas??

I liked the way `xv' does the color reduction when it cannot allocate
all colors. I think that's an algorithm based on the number of color cells
which are still available for free programming; only in very rare cases
does it have to re-use color cells which have been allocated by a
different program.

Congratulations, Romano:
I think your program was the by now very best approach to the problem. One
"only" needs the "most suitable" set of colors. (Maybe one should really
reduce all icon's color entries to 8 bit, or even 4 bit, by forcing the
color's low order nibble to 0, before one calls pixy?)

I tried it with a set of 32 colors, 16 of which are those thich Win95/Win3
uses in its icons. Here's my 32col.xpm file (even though I'm still not
completely satisfied with the results):

Oh, yeah, Romano, you should really put your email address somewhere into

announcement...

I have encountered varying annoyances with fvwm-2.0.41, XEmacs-19.13
and ssh-1.2.13.

If I restart fvwm (2.0.41) in HP-UX (9.05), FvwmPager loses all XEmacs
frames. If frame (= window) was iconified, it just disappers from the
Pager and only reappears if I resize or move the frame (it does not
reapper into FvwmPager just by deiconifing). If a frame was not
iconified, it does not show any output anymore, though it accepts
commands. (I can C-x 5 2 a new frame and delete the old frame). No
such behaviour in my Linux machine...

I have another problem with XEmacs, this time run over ssh. Every time
XEmacs shows new output, the pointer warps to the root window position
that XEmacs frame occupies. Desktop does not change, but the pointer
warps in the desktop I'm currently working.

I have no (X)Emacs specific style statements, except for icons.


Oops, I almost forgot: Sometimes FvwmButtons (vanilla, haven't tested
Jarl's) does not swallow Pager coorectly, but leaves a few pixels
empty space below and right of Pager. When I resize FvwmButtons, the
Pager resizes itself correctly. 


*FvwmButtonsGeometry 270x108+0+0  # no icons, so I need the size
*FvwmButtonsColumns 6
*FvwmButtons(3x6) - foo SwallowModule "FvwmPager" FvwmPager 0 8
*FvwmButtons 	Refresh		no_pic Refresh
*FvwmButtons(2x3) - foo Swallow "DClock" Exec dclock -geometry -1500-1500 &
*FvwmButtons 	Restart		no_pic Restart fvwm
*Fvwmbuttons    Lock            no_pic Exec "" xlock &
*FvwmButtons 	Identify	no_pic Module FvwmIdent
*FvwmButtons(2x3) - foo Swallow "XLoad" Exec xload -geometry -1500-1500 &
*FvwmButtons 	Stick		no_pic Stick
*FvwmButtons 	Quit            no_pic Quit


Solving these problems would make fvwm even better window manager (for
me, at least :)

I'm trying to use the warp-or-run function that someone posted here,
and am looking for a warp-to-or-run function.

The function I have is:

AddToFunc warp-or-run-prog
+       "I"     Next [$0 CirculateHit] Iconify -1
+       "I"     Next [$0 CirculateHit] Focus
+       "I"     None [$0]              Exec $1 &

which I initiate like:

warp-or-run-prog emacs:* /home/bin/Start_XEmacs
warp-or-run-prog Xims* Xims


but when I try:

warp-or-run-prog Netscape:* netscape

it always finds and pops open the window, but it also always starts
a new netscape browser along with it.  Any suggestions?

---------

Also:

Has anyone a function that will not only pop open a current instance of
a program, but will pull it from another desk to the current one if
it has to?

  - The reintroduction of the EdgeScroll x1000 effect, for a cylindrical or
  spherical desktop, misbehaves when one of the desktop dimensions is 1,
  i.e. either a Nx1 or 1xN DeskTopSize. Try moving against one the edges of
  the desktop along that single dimension, and the window will jump to the
  other side, but the cursor gets stuck on the edge.

  - When EdgeScrollX and/or Y are not 100%, i.e. a full page, moving a
  window against one of the edges still pages a full page.

  The diffs below fix the two problems above, (if indeed the second is a
  problem.) It also eliminates a bunch of what I think is redundant code
  from virtual.c, that had to do with implementing the x1000 edge scrolling.

<this is a bit of a nit but it has happened enough to warrant a post> 

Would it be a problem if the titlebar button action took place on a
button release (ButtonUp) event rather than a button press (ButtonDown)
event? 

The problem is that if I click on a titlebar button (Iconify is the
typical culprit) and the button happens to be sitting over the pager,
the window gets iconified as it should and the pager switches to a new
desktop/viewport!  The pager reacts to ButtonUp events not ButtonDown. 

I have to be real quick on the mouse to have the ButtonUp event occur in
the window being iconified and not in the Pager. 

Thanks, 
-Bill

This sounds like a procmail question.  You can put a procmail exec
statement in your .forward file.  Procmail can do anything you want to

Since I upgraded to X11R6 I have the problem that sometimes the
keyboard combinations to move from one desktop to another stop
working. Clicking on the pager with the mouse works fine. Restarting
fvwm doesn't work.

I'm still using 1.24r, but I think this is related to the Xserver,
because it only happens with R6, not R5. Also, if it were fvwm's fault
it'd be cured by restarting it.

Any ideas? This is on XFree86 3.1.2 under linux.

Thanks for you bug-report : I had the 'time' problem to my TODO list...

The clock is updated each minute : I force the the 'select' in
'EndlessLopp' to give up :

      tv.tv_sec=60;
      tv.tv_usec=0;
      if ((ret = select(fd_width,&readset,NULL,NULL,&tv)) <= 0)
        { DrawGoodies(); goto hack; }

I couldn't manage to have SIGALRM working on OSF-Dec : perhaps someone
on the mailing list knows why (has it something to do with fvwm already
using this signal : the SA_RESTART didn't relaunch the read primitives
in the loop)

Icons in the buttons will be added as soon as I port it to fvwm-2.x

I'm also interested in having a 'PopupMenu x,y' statement in fvwm to
bind menus with a ... Linux/Start button ;-)

Hi All,

I just saw in another post, that you can select a character to be
underlined in a menu, by putting a & in front of it. I tried it and it
works, but not quite :-)

If I popup the menu with the mouse, typing the character is enough to
select the item. But if I popup the menu with a key binding, then the
first character I type is ignored.

Also, it would be nice if when a key binding is used to popup a menu,
that using the keybinding again would pop the menu away (I often popup
the window list just to see which windows I've got, without actually
wanting to change my focus.)

Thanks for a great window manager, and any tips which you might have
for getting around these slight behavioural problems.

see ya,

Steve

I know this is off topic, but I recall somewhere on one
of the lists I was on discussion that there was an X
server available that would tread two graphics cards
on a sun like 1 really wide X server.

I've now a friend who could use this, and if anyone
knows what I'm talking about, any info would be
appreciated.

Thanks!

Considering there are a total of 63 'possible' virtual consoles, I have
found it much easier to use 'alt-leftarrow' and 'alt-rightarrow' while
at the console to change back to X...note, however, that 'ctrl-alt-arrow'
does not work.

What I have found useful is to use an 'X' ed button which works very much like
the push-pins you're accustomed to.

ButtonStyle 3 13 26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1 79x29@1 63x48@0 79x65@1 70x75@0 50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0

Oh, and while I'm giving 'tips' here is something to pattern
what (IMHO) would be a very useful 'example .fvwmrc' setup
would be like:

(I have a subdir, .fvwm under which .fvwm/funcs resides,
 along with mouse, keyboard, sytle, menus, paths, etc..,
 so that I can chage the file, and re-read it to be
 close to run-time-configurable)

Oops!  This was my patch...I didn't write the man page, and I knew
this was a problem...the intentions were what the man page says,
but it behaves as in your last example.

At 4:43AM Friday, March 15 a network bridge in the basement of the building
where the HPC computers are kept went kaput.  This caused a network outage
lasting until about 7PM Saturday, March 16.  During this time no network
connections were possible both in and out of HPC computers.

All services have been returned and all inbound and outbound mail excepting
that which was sent "urgent" was queued and properly delivered when the
network resumed functioning.  Warnings of the inability to deliver mail
were most likely sent but the mail was eventually delivered.  There is no
need to resend any mail except that which was sent "urgent".

It's called Xvan and it's available at ftp.x.org.

I found it confusing using Xvan + fvwm, so I stopped using Xvan.  But,
it was really fun running xeyes spread across 3 screens. :)

This behaviour must be new in fvwm2 or must configurable somehow.
I'am still using fvwm 1.24r and my titlebar buttons react on button
release.  On button press they only present a sunken border frame
to reflect, that a specific button has been hit.

Hi all,

I've been working with X for a little while but really don't know how it 
works.  I'm sick of twm where I work and I want to make all my dest tops 
standard.  I got fvwm and compiled it on a sun.  compiled fine with a 
little work.  My problem is I'm not sure what files it uses when it 
starts.  When I run the manager with the system.fvwmrc file provided with 
the distribution it comes up but unless I have xterms in my .xinitrc I 
can get nothing to come up i.e. with the mouse and such.  I didn't 
install this on the system ..  just my account.

I guess what I am asking for is pure basics to get some windows up nd 
some functionality to the manager....

Thanks,

rkurnik@cs.wvu.edu

Yes it should.  I have this and many other updates in line for the

I recently tried out FVWM using 16bits per pixel color depth
on the X server, and FvwmForm seemed unable to cope with it.
It decided to not use ANY of the specified colors, and instead
used just black text on a white background.  The only change I made 
was changing the X-server color depth.  When I changed the color
depth of the display back to 8bpp, the problem went away.  
Has this been noticed by others?

Hello, we are trying to force all of our users to use FVWM,
however, htey are resisting because of their mwm resource files.
Is there a program (script) that would convert .xxx files from
othere window managers to .fvwmrc.


Thank you,

Works as you describe (ButtonUp event iconifies the window, not ButtonDown)
under 2.0.41 as well, so I'm not sure it's a fvwm/fvwm2 issue.  Perhaps
it's caused by something in the .fvwm2rc, like MWMButtons vs FvwmButtons?
Seems unlikely, but who knows...

I installed fvwm 2.0.41 and while playing with the configuration I found
that while it works fine on the user's .fvwm2rc, it would not load
the system-wide configuration if there was no user's .fvwm2rc. Fvwm2 loads,
with nothing except background and cursor (movable). Mouse buttons do 
nothing, killing the X server unjams it though.

I am running Slack 3.0, 1.2.13 ELF. I installed fvwm2 by hand (to keep it 
from screwing my stuff up with that install mystery-script[1]), 
also installed over 2.0.40, so I might not have gotten everything right, but
it seems kinda fishy that it would work fine with ~/.fvwmrc but can't use
/etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc, fvwm/system.fvwm2rc, fvwm2/system.fvwmrc, or
fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc. 

Sorry, I'm not on the list. Flames - don't bother. I'm going to try a
reinstall, but just thought I'd report my difficulty.

Don

[1] couple versions ago, I installed my first fvwm2 by hand because the 
install script made me suspicious. Later made a backup and tried make install.
Sure enough, it disrupted the banner/background of fvwm1.

You copy the system.fvwmrc file into your home directory under the
name of .fvwmrc or .fvwm2rc (if you've installed Fvwm 2.0.*).

Apart from starting a different window manager, everything else about
your configuration should stay the same.  I.e. you now have a setup
which starts twm (from .xinitrc or .xsession, probably).  You just
change the call of twm to read fvwm (or fvwm2), and off you go.

It's a know {misfeature,feature,bug} of Fvwm2 that it doesn't read
system.fvwmrc.

I've experienced the same thing using 1.24r with X11R5 (Solaris).  However 
the keyboard combo does work again after I use the pager.  The last time 
it happened I was using xvnews.  A fitting punishment for using an 
OpenWindows application?

Nope.  The styles of rc's are all pretty different, and a conversion
script wouldn't be the easiest thing to do.  But there are lots of rc
examples out there, and making your own isn't too bad.

Take a look at the official web site:

                     http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/

and it has pointers to all kinds of info, including many rc file
examples.

And if you want to make a script to convert parts of .mwmrc files to
..fvwmrc or .fvwm2rc syntax, feel free to contribute it!

Actually, it does look for the file in the system area though.  It
just doesn't look for the file with the word 'system' in front of it.

Here is the search method:

  $HOME/.fvwm2rc
  FvwmDir/.fvwm2rc

where FvwmDir is specified in the Fvwm.tmpl file.

Dear all,

I've followed the development of fvwm rather closely, and finally I've
switched to using it.  Of course, I want fvwm to have all features
under the sun, but I think the following are not unreasonable:

  - When the mouse pointer is warped to a window (with Focus, say), it
    is warped to the upper left hand corner.  Is there a way to have
    it warpt to the center instead?

  - When I have "EdgeResistance 100 50", say, I cannot move a window
    N<50 pixels off-screen.  Olwm allowed one to first move a window
    more than 50 pixels off-screen then move back and thereby N<50
    pixels were possible.  Using fvwm, the window snaps back to the
    edge of the screen as soon as it gets to within 50 pixels of the
    edge of the screen.

  - Fvwm doesn't understand "-0" in the X-offset or Y-offset fields of
    a geometry specification.

I'll wait for the Great Style Flag Rewrite for per-window AutoRaise
(and AutoLower, aka FvwmClean).

And about time!  :-)

I have just a question for the list, actually, not a response to Kai's
post.  But I am wondering about a phenomenon that I only noticed today
(after more than a year with fvwm).

If I stretch the window horizontally while it's vertically maximized, it
loses track of the fact that it used to be some other vertical size, and
I cannot get back to the original vertical size without an explicit
re-size.  I.e., the title-bar button doesn't work to vertically shrink
the window back.

Is this the current operation?  If so, I wish it weren't.  I think I am
using Fvwm Ver 2.0 pl 32.


best regards,

My favorite question.

You can't get exactly what you describe, but you can get close:

# Simulate the Warp function from older fvwm
AddToFunc Warp "I" Next [$1] Iconify -1
+	       "I" Next [$1] focus
+              "I" CursorMove 2 2
+              "I" None [$1] Beep
+              "I" None [$1] CursorMove -2 -2

Use it like this:

Key f R N Warp "FvwmIconBox" FvwmIconBox

This  function  moves 2 pixels   down and 2 pixels   right  to get the
pointer  fully into   the window.  It  is also   possible to  write  a
function that takes arguments for how far to  move.  I don't know of a
way to get exactly to the center of any window.

Can't help on your other questions.

Works for me, e.g. "xev -geometry -0+0" starts a window in the upper right
corner of the screen, in v 2.0.41 under IRIX.  Is this what you meant?

I made a suggestion here a while ago that X and Y percentages be added to the
warp function.  So, "warp 0 0" gives the current behaviour, "warp 0 100"
puts the pointer in the lower left corner, and "warp 50 50" gives the
commonly desired behavior of centering the pointer, all independent of
the window size.

I am running fvwm 2.0.40 and 2.0.41 under Solaris 2.3.  I can specify "-0"
when exec'ing a program, as Robert showed above, and the window is
positioned just fine.  But, I know of 1 little "geometry" problem with the
IconBox style: 

  Style "*" IconBox 5 -80 -140 -1

positions the icon box along the bottom of the screen (bottom edge of box 
is 1 pixel above bottom edge), but

  Style "*" IconBox 5 -80 -140 -0
                               ^^
doesn't.  Icons show up just anywhere on the screen.  So, in this 
instance, fvwm does not like a '-0'.  I thought I had sent this to Chuck 
Hines a while back, but I must have spaced it out since it's not 
anywhere in my mail log.  Sorry.

Is it something like this that you're seeing?

  Without going into the merits of warping to the middle vs the upper left
  corner, the patch below should accomplish what David describes.  

  I made Focus == Focus 0 0, i.e. no parameters equals current behavior.
  Should this patch have no adverse side effects (aka bugs) and be
  integrated in the main version, Focus == Focus 50 50, could be an
  alternative.

  The patch below was minimally tested. It should apply cleanly against
  2.0.41.

This is what I meant.  It turns out that FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan and
FvwmWinList all understand "-0", so this is not much of a problem for
me.  I don't use IconBox anyway...

Thanks a lot for your answer,

X-Majordomo: 1.92

Well, following my post about a month ago, I am pleased to announce
(for those who do not know already) that an Alpha version of XFree86
312D is now available for OS/2. It can be downloaded from
ftp.xfree86.org in the beta section.... 

Now back to the subject at hand. I have "ported" fvwm to OS/2 (not
much to it, really) and it runs fine (except for modules for now). The
big problem, and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right
direction, only surfaced lately when we started compiling apps from
the /contrib selection. 

So here it is: certain apps, when run under fvwm, do not receive
keyboard focus. These include, for example: xtetris, xpaint, chimera,
x3270, while xcalc, xedit have no problem. Note that under other
window managers (namely twm, ctwm and tvtwm) this does not occur. 

The other symptom is that the window title bar for those apps will not
change color when the mouse is over them/clicked on. Color remain that
of an app which doesn't have focus. 

My guess is that fvwm is, for some reason, flagging these apps to not
receive focus. I have looked through the source but cannot really see
where this would occur. Maybe someone (Robert, Chuck?) could point the
flags which would cause this. 

Note also that I don't believe this to be a problem with fvwm. I am
pretty sure the problem lies somewhere in the X libs, because running
fvwm remotely works fine for remote apps and work improperly for local
apps. This is not really surprising, BTW. A lot of the X libs are rely
upon certain Unix "traits", such as linefeeds to terminate lines and
':' as a separator in path lists. 

Well, any help would be appreciated! Hopefully, I'll get fvwm up and
running (properly) on OS/2 real soon. 

Thanks,

Hi,

using 2.0.41, I read that "Module FvwmWinList Transient" is supposed
to emulate "WindowList".  I find, however, that it doesn't: binding
"Module FvwmWinList Transient" to a key won't work because the window
list pops down as soon as I release the key.

I tried this because of one shortcoming of WindowList: you can't
change the action upon selecting a window in the WindowList.  I have
a DeskTopSize of 1x2.  Putting a window at +0+0 in the lower page
then selecting that window with the WindowList will put the mouse
cursor at +0+0 (in the lower page), too.  Thus, it takes
EdgeResistance milliseconds till the page is switched to the upper
page :-(

What should I do?  (I think for the moment I'm turning off
EdgeScroll.)

I am using the latest version of Jarl's buttons and have a quick question,
in my main button bar I wondered if I can popup a menu from a button, so
I put a line like this in my .buttonsrc file:
	(Title Test,     Icon Terminal.xpm,         Action Popup Utilities)

Where Utilities is my main menu in the .fvwmrc file.

I get this error in my console:
	fvwm: No such menu

So, must I:
	(a) define utilities in the .buttonsrc file and duplicate stuff?
	or	
	(b) set my buttons in the main .fvwmrc file? Messy.
	or
	(c) do something obvious after a reply from this list?

Hello,

You mean you got 200396 to work? Hurra! :-)

Humm, according to the syntax, Action takes only one argument, in this case
it thinks its action should be 'Popup'. You should quote it like 
 Action 'Popup Utilities'.

Hope this helps.

> 	(c) do something obvious after a reply from this list?
:-)

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Slightly offtopic again but my news server died in a minor fire apparently so
this is the closest thing. 

I'd a look at 'xpmbiff' which I saw mentioned in the archives of this list
(see? sorta on topic, honest!), I'd really like a biff that used xpm's, but 
xpmbiff isn't it.
Its too simple, it only tells me that I have mail, even if I have read it
and not gotten about to filing it (or scrapping it).

Besides that I currently use xbiff++ which allows different xbm's for
different people and plays a different sound. Unfortunately this one
time pride of my desktop now looks oddly colourless, does anyone have
any suggestions as to what to use instead? What do people out there in
Fvwm land generally swallow to keep a check on their mail?

Preferred features:
	- Checks mail status
	- Uses Xpm's
	- Allows for different piccies/sounds

Xfaces not an option by the way.

On a unrelated note Jarl's button bar can be made to look nice! Good work fella.
(Guess what I spent the afternoon doing? Pity that it took so long to figure out
why the bar with only swallowed items was *tiny*!)

Hi Folks, here is my latest PixmapButton patch.  It has not been extensively
tested, so please try it and report problems to me.  You have been given fair
warning ;^).

Bug fixes/changes:
- when no pixmap button support compiled in, things should work correctly
- transparency mask should now work correctly (offset was incorrectly handled
before)
- some code cleanups here and there

Added:
- usage infolet in man page (fvwm2.man)

The patch installs onto a clean fvwm 2.0.41 tree.  For instance, if fvwm-2.041/
was in my current directory, I could patch it with 'zcat fvwm-pxp-3.diff.gz |
patch' .  The patch itself is uuencoded and attached to this message.

Thanks,

Hi !

While working with Xlib and the fvwm we have the following problem:

	When using the function XGetGeometry() for a specified window,the x- and y- variables 
	returned by this function only contain zeros.

  		dpy 	   = (Display *) xv_get (frame, XV_DISPLAY);	
  		canvas_win = (Window)    xv_get (frame, XV_XID);

  		XGetGeometry (dpy, canvas_win ,&win2,&x,&y,&w,&h,&b,&d);
	
	I am sure to have referenced the correct window, because the other variables	
	which are returned from this function e.g. height and widht are correct for 
	it. So, I am not able to get the location of the window.
	Who can tell me which structure contains or which function returns the correct
	values for getting the position of the window ?

Thanks.

Hello everybody!

Doesn't seem to be much action on the list this week. Here's something to
cheer you up a little:

I've made a patch to give vertical titlebars to fvwm windows. You can get it
at my homepage, I even put a snapshot up. It's nothing fantastic, don't know
if it's useful, but it was something I had wanted to do for a long time..
When you're on 640x400 or 800x600 you want to exploit the height of the screen
to its fullest, and titlebars are just in the way.
It didn't turn out as nice as expected when I found out there was no reasonable
way to display rotated text :-( Anyway, it's up for grabs. If someone likes
it maybe we can convince Chuck to put it in, but no high hopes :-)

More? Hmm, the latest FvwmButtons from my hands is 200396b, not any fancy news
since 130396, just some bugfixes. Small ones.

Oh, and here's a thing I was wond'ring about - is there really any use in 
maintaining both PixmapPath and IconPath in fvwm? I haven't looked at all
the different loading routines (must be.. atleast 3 of them in fvwm itself)
but is there a problem in concatenating them together, and when asked to load
an icon first try to load it as XPM and on failure as a bitmap?
I just thought it would be simpler to use just IconPath, sorry if I've missed
something obvious..

I'll round off here... Btw, if anyone has any ideas about what to do with
the titledown patch, send me a note. I guess it can be used for Asian topdown
written languages, but I really don't know anything about how that is coded..
Btw, if you have a rotated latin font you can ofcourse get rotated titles,
and likewise X11R6 and up is supposed to support on-the-fly rotation matrices.
Do what you like.

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Mouse/key bindings use "0" to indicate the fifth button from the right of the
titlebar.

The ButtonStyle and Style commands use "10" to describe the same button.

Could these three directives get together and decide which number to use?
(Perhaps they could use both numbers.) It's (hopefully) a small change, and it
would aid .fvwmrc preprocessing, if nothing else.

I'm not Jarl, but I hope it doesn't matter :=). You can find Jarl's
homepage via http://www.fm.unit.no/~jatotal/ 

The homepage is in Norwegian but the link to the fvwm-buttons is there
somewhere ...

Hi all,

I've defined the following in my .fvwmrc (using 2.0.40):

	Key Muhenkan    A       A       PopupList WindowList
	
	AddToFunc PopupList     "I"     CursorMove -1000 +1000
	+                       "I"     WindowList


And it works. . .  sort of. 

When I press the desired key, the window list does appear in the desired 
location (lower left hand corner), but I then have to make 2 key depresses to 
do anything. i.e. I have to press the number corresponding to the window name 
twice to focus on the chosen window, or I have to press ESC twice to get rid 
of the WindowList.

Any ideas as to how I can get this down to one key depress.

Thanks,
Eric.

Not exactly what you'd call bug free is it? :-) But its great fun and quite
useful on smaller displays where the title bar is usually in the next page...
very irritating.

It appears to have some serious bother with shaped stuff, try just popping
up xeyes when the title style is set to vertical. Very confused!

It would be a lot better (it would be superb!) if it could be implemented 
on a per window basis...I'd quite like to have some stuff (like Xterms)
have sidebars while most have horizontal by default, or does this
impinge on the famed 'style flags' debate as well?

On a unrelated note, to let several users use fvwm here it would be of terrific
help if FvwmButtons ran programs through my shell (with all its associated ENV
 variables), on X-terminals here the full path is needed, and often explicit
setting of env vars via scripts. This is obviously not great when less
experienced people go to customise their setups.
Please tell me that the next release address this problem, at least I am
fairly sure its the shell that needs added..

And I'm still waiting for

or

Okay, another minor problem with Jarl's neat vertical title bars,
they don't change (from horizontal) at all when I log in on 
a sun console (Solaris 2.5, Openwindows 3.5, SPARC IPX).
They are vertical when logging onto an NCD X-Terminal connected
to a SPARC server (same setup).
Strange eh?

I know this idea could be dismissed as 'silly' and unworthy of
including in FVWM but the option of vertical or horizontal
title bars for each window is exactly the type of thing that makes
people change window managers! And should X11R6 allow properly
rotated fonts...well...that would be superb!

I await the usual flurry of Jarl patches'n'fixes with interest.

Hmm I actually hadn't tried it with shape extensions at all, but I see your
point after starting up xeyes :-) But when not using shapes it seems stable
enough?

Yep, this would have to wait until Chuck does the big rewrite.

Mmm, I'm not really sure how FvwmButtons can handle this in any way...
it executes programs with the environment it was executed with, and this 
really depends only on your setup. When fvwm Execs a program it does it by
starting a shell to do it, and the shell will read the system - and the users
- cshrc's or whatever (there is a patch out there to get fvwm to use other
shells than the default csh)... Sorry I'm to tired to expand on this now,
but it really is all in the setup, what is done before starting fvwm..

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

I've just discovered an odd bug in fvwm2, unless I've just doing
something wrong. I have the following line in my fvwm2rc file.
(wrapped for clarity)

*FvwmButtons Netscape xmosaic.xpm Exec "Netscape" netscape -ncols 64
-geometry 860x900+2+1 & 

However, when I run netscape from this button, netscape doesn't appear
to get the -ncols 64 command. It gets the geometry right, however. Amd,
if instead of this, I run netscape from a shell script that exec's it
with the same command line, when I run that shell script from
FvwmButtons, then everything works fine.

Yes! It works! (compiled all in: all patches to fvwm in your home page 
(You know I trust you)). And more: the "depressed FvwmPager" bug has gone 
(some bug I suspect). And more: it look really *faster* on startup, and 
not only Buttons, but all the stuff (I use pixmaps in the menu and now I 
have put a little pixmap in the title bar thanks to pxp patch). I have not
tried vertical titlebar. 

I write this and cc: to fvwm list because I think that at least 
the line continuation patch, the pixmap cache patch, and the popup 
patch should be put in the standard dist... IMHO. 

Bye,

It turns out that I like SmartPlacement quite a bit, but I'd like it
to do a bit more.  The thing is, I've got a few windows on screen that
I'd like SmartPlacement to pretend not to be there (like xload,
xclock, xpostit, FvwmPager, FvwmIconMan, ...).  I don't mind these
covered up when (more important) windows are placed.

Does this need the Great Style Flag rewrite to be possible?

Whatcha think?

After thinking some more about it, I think that I want some windows to
be disregarded based on X ressources: XLoad, XClock and so on.  But I
would also like fvwm to disregard all windows with height greater than
or equal to 80 % of screen height.

Actually fvwm should DWIM, but this might be a heuristic.  Probably

Never fear everyone - I plan on putting Jarl's new FvwmButtons into
the next release (ready early next week, hopefully) and the necessary
patches for it after I finish reviewing them, as long as I have no
problems with the patches.  I like the new capabilities (although I
don't use a buttonbar myself), so I really would like to get it in
there.

Speaking of patches, Jarl's vertical titlebar patch will mostly likely
NOT be included...  While it looks interesting, I don't really feel
that fvwm needs this right now.  Sorry everyone who may have been
looking forward to that.  I am keeping the patch file though, in case
I do percieve some need for something like this in the future...

BTW - Jarl, there is a program called xvertext in the R5 contrib on
ftp.x.org which can be used to rotate text strings in earlier X
versions.

Great! This means the fvwm-caching.patch will have to go in there too,
and probably fvwm-linecont and fvwm-popup :-) I still haven't got any 
bug reports on 200396b, this could mean it's up to beta standard now.
There will be some more feature patches, but whether they come tonight
or in may is hard to say.

This was only as expected, it really was just a quick hack. But I intend
to rewrite it and resubmit it after SFR (the style flag rewrite), then it
could be used for separate windows. Will also experiment some with rotation
of title etc.

If there is any interest in this I guess I can maintain it as a patch to
the releases of fvwm until such a time that it might get included or is
forgotten/obsolete.

Thanks, I'll look at it. Hope it's faster than XGetPixel/XPutPixel - that
was _slow_.

Vyrdsamt,

Yup.  Like I said, I still have to inspect those patches to make sure
I agree with them completely.  As long as they are 'ok' to me, they'll
be in there.

I believe that it draws the string onto an image and then rotates that
image.  Don't know how fast it is though, as I never played with it.
I think that XFig uses that code, and it's pretty snappy w/ the
rotation, so I imagine it's pretty quick.

Hi, folks.  I'm not on the mailing list so if you want to respond just
email me.

I wrote a neat little applet using FvwmForm.  It's a menu-driven host
selector.  I guess this could be done easily in GoodStuff, but I don't
use GoodStuff (or whatever it's called now).  

To get this to work, you need to create symbolic links to FvwmForm
that are named Rtelnet, CGL and other.  These can be changed if you
change the names of the Forms (which I expect you will want to do).
Basically it works like this: call Rtelnet from an FvwmTalk window
using 'Rtelnet' or map it to a key or menu.  Then when you run
Rtelnet, a list of host classes will pop up.  Click on the host class
you want.  It will then pop up a list of hosts which you choose from.
When you click on a host, it will rsh to the host.  Note- I did this
on an SGI which uses winterm.  You can change winterm to rxvt if you want.

Things to do: generalize, add working keymaps, error reporting in case
winterm or rsh fails.  I think that this program shows how flexible
FvwmForm is- heck, I think if somebody really want to do it, you could
create an FVWM customization menu which wrote .fvwmrc files just from
your selections!  If anybody has done this, or my Rtelnet form is just
a rehash of an old idea, please tell me.

--PART-BOUNDARY=.1960322170736.ZM14342.z-code.com
Content-Type: text/plain ; charset=us-ascii

I've yet to come up with a compelling reason to switch from 1.x, so I
thought I'd lob the question to this list.  I'm not subscribed yet, so
please copy me on replies, but I have perused the FAQ and list archive
from <URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm>.

I find that I'm using nearly every one of the fvwm 1.x settings that
have been dropped in 2.0:

   Cursor  cursor_num cursor_type             (obsoleted)
   OpaqueResize                               (obsoleted)
   StickyBackColor colorname                  (obsoleted)
   StickyForeColor colorname                  (obsoleted)
   StubbornIcons                              (obsoleted)
   StubbornIconPlacement                      (obsoleted)
   StubbornPlacement                          (obsoleted)

Of these, Cursor and StubbornIcons are the most important (even though
StubbornIcons seems to work only part of the time).  OpaqueResize is
also extremely useful for debugging window geometry problems in other
applications (especially Motif), because you can watch the confusion
develop as the window shape changes.

One other setting that I don't currently use, but that I've played with
in the past, is DontMoveOff.  The FAQ says there's no equivalent; what
is the closest similar effect?  (I'm surprised that there's no mention
of this anywhere in the list archives ... maybe people who are used to
virtual desktops just aren't bothered by windows that don't stay on the
screen, but I'd prefer to have it available just so that it's possible
to duplicate MWM very closely.  Fvwm as "the window manger that can be
any other window manager" is an attractive concept.)

I'm also using these functions:

   CirculateDown [ name window_name ]         Next (not compatible)
   CirculateUp [ name window_name ]           Prev (not compatible)
   Warp [ name window_name ]                  Next or Prev (not compatible)

I could probably live without these if somebody can suggest how to get
the closest possible behavior out of Next and Prev, but I haven't found
any explanation in the mailing list archives for why they were dropped.
(Again, the real ones would be nice to have for MWM-cloning.)

I'm also using TogglePage, and I hope it'll make it back in before
there is an official release.  I haven't seen this mentioned in the
list archives, so I'll throw in the comment that TogglePage really
needs the PagingDefault setting to work properly; so don't forget to
put that (or the equivalent) back as well.

Finally, so that this message can be at least a bit constructive, I've
attached diffs for fvwmrc_convert (from 2.0.41) to fix a few cases it
mishandled (primarily Cursor and OpaqueResize).

Hello,

just a couple of notes:

--

Seems to be a small problem with keyword parsing in fvwm, probably known but:
if a prefix of a keyword matches another keyword, it might get mistaken for
that other keyword.

Example:    AddToMenu Title-Menu "Centered" TitleStyle Centered
The TitleStyle gets misparsed and what you get is the title "Centered".

Workaround: Do it through a function.

Quick solution: Make sure fvwm always tries to parse longest keywords first.
This is what is done for functions now, but there are plenty of cases where
it is done "by hand" to recognize keywords.

Good solution: Modify mystrncasecmp() (or make a variant of it) so it doesn't
match if the next char in either string is alphanumeric (i.e. isalnum())

--

More on TitleDown (vertical titlebars):

Thanks for all the info on xvertext/xfig, I had a look at it. Definitively
overkill. But I pulled out some code, modified, deleted, rewrote, and lo, it
works. Now displays vertical titles either written downwards like it should
be or upwards (rotated anti-clockwise (spent too much time in France (:-)))
(Thank you emacs for matching my parantheses (:-))

I will try to make a clean patch for this for fvwm-2.0.42 when it arrives
"early next week", should hopefully not be too much trouble.

Btw, for you who only tested the first version, now it also works with shaped
windows. And in case you didn't notice - it has the lines for sticky windows.

--

Sorry too keep you on your toes Chuck, but I will disappear any day now, when
I finally realize I have less than a week to do my masters degree :-) And
after the holidays men in green will put me in an army camp for three months,
so I'll be sort of occupied. But I will be back. Guerilla wm programming is
a lifestyle I start to appreciate :-)

Vyrdsamt,
-Jarl

Modules can send arbitrary command to fvwm. I think that it would be
nice if fvwm could send commands to modules. Perhaps something like:

Send "FvwmModule" "command string"

which would send the string "command string" to all instances of FvwmModule
which are currently running. And then fvwm could send a packet to the
appropriate module which contained the text. 

This idea came up when somebody suggested that it would be cool if FvwmIconMan
could use the arrow keys to move from one window to another, and of course,
the other window list/icon box modules could do exactly the same.

A more ambitions way to use this would be to write a module which could extend
the fvwm command language. For example, something I've often thought would
be cool, but couldn't think of an easy way to do, is if fvwm could maintain
state for windows that the user could modify. I currently have two buttons
on my title bars, one which calls "Maximize 0 100" and another which does
"Maximize 100 0". If I click on the horizontal zoom button, then the vertical
zoom button, I would expect the window to first expand horizontally, and then
expand vertically so that it occupies the entire screen. Instead, when I click
on the vertical button, it just goes back to its original size. The problem
obviously is that fvwm doesn't maintain a stack for the various window sizes.
Also, it might be cool to be able to write fvwm functions which could remember
where windows are, or their window stack position, etc. Not easy things to add
to fvwm without bloating it, but if you could send commands to modules, you
could write a module whose only purpose is to implement extensions to the fvwm
command language.

Any thoughts?

I second this idea.  I too recently have wished that a couple of windows
could remember some state information and have title buttons

If someone implements this, they should be sure to support inter-module
communication.  I.e., allow module1 to send a string to fvwm like
   "send module2Name command"

An interesting use of such a feature is to use it to support modules that
can reconfigure themselves on the fly.  Say, have FvwmTalk support
   "send moduleName configCommand"
Sure would beat edit .fvwmrc/restart cycles.

Sorry to jump in, but I second this wholeheartedly.  While I love FVWM
more than any other WM, something that I really hate is the fact that when
I make a change to my .fvwm2rc file, I have to restart.  While I'm at my
console, this isn't a problem ... but when I'm sitting up in the computer
lab it's a pain (it takes FOREVER to restart).  Jarl's Buttons have the
option of an external rc file which I really, *REALLY* like.  I can make
changes w/o starting FVWM.  Not to compare apples to oranges, but OLWM
lets me change menu items w/o restarting.

I'd love to see an option that I could add to a menu:

+      "Reread Config"  Reconfig

I just downloaded and compiled fvwm 2.0.41, and discovered a rather nasty 
bug in FvwmSaveDesk.  You see, I have it set up so that novice users can 
simply click on a menu to save their current window configuration (via 
FvwmSaveDesk) into .fvwmdesk, which is automagically read on startup.  
Now, as FvwmSaveDesk is distributed, if you have windows on desktops 
other than the current desk, it would insert something similar to this:

AddToFunc InitFunction	"I" Desk 3 0
+			xterm ....
	Wait "I" xterm
	"I" Desk 2 0 
+ 			xterm ....
etc...

The problem is that first, there needs to be a plus in front of the Wait 
and Desk commands, and second, the syntax of the Wait command is wrong: 
the "I" should be first.  I've hacked out a fix for it, and have attached 
the new source to FvwmSaveDesk.c.  This fix is a hack, and not very 
pretty (I had to add the CurCmd global variable -- yuk.) but it works.  
Do with it as you will.  Please include this fix in the next release of 
fvwm.  :)

Also, I think this method of starting things on separate desktops is 
rather clunky.  Has anyone invested any thought in a superior method?  
(that will always work...)

There is EdgeResistance where you can set a number of pixels.  The
window won't be moved off-screen unless you move it off-screen by more
than that number of pixels.

IMVHO, Next and Prev are the greatest thing under the sun.  While
they're not compatible to CirculateUp and CirculateDown, they do what
I have always wished Circulate{Up,Down} to do:  With Circulate, the
movement is in a window ring where the relative positions of the
windows are based on the time of creation of the windows.  (This may
be completely wrong as my idea of what the Circulate functions do is
based on twm not fvwm...)

With Next/Prev the relative position of the windows is based on the
order of `visiting' them, i.e. with Prev I can go to the last window I
was in before the current one.

Well, after years of devout ctwm-ism, I have decided the time has come
to change to fvwm, so I have gone and got myself a copy of 2.0.41 and
installed it on my linux box (1.3.77).  First impressions are that it is
a much more powerful and flexible window manager than ctwm (though I
don't find the FvwmWinList isn't quite as nice as it's ctwm equivalent).
I am having a few problems though, most noticably restarting the window
manager" doesn't work.

What I'm asking therefore is whether I should persevere with the fvwm2
series or stick to 1 until it is stable.

Cheers

Mike

But then again maybe we should allow "hight handed" people to put the
title bar to the right side of the window, where they would "grab" it
intuitively... Well, never mind, I thought just for the completeness of it
;-)

I think (especially for 640x480 notebooks) this is a very useful addition.
If I had one, I would certainly use it, and I'm going to suggest this
feature to a friend (who happens to have one). I'll wait for the vertical
letters, however.


Chuck - do you really want to keep this out of the official distribution?
Once it is stable, it could be kept in #ifdef's but wouldn't deviate from
the main distribution.

OK, I should have thought of that myself.  But will EdgeResistance
prevent initial placement from being offscreen?  What's the fvwm 2
equivalent of mwm's PositionOnScreen?

} based on twm not fvwm...)

Hmm.  I'd never really paid close attention, but my impression of
Circulate{Up,Down} is that there is no fixed ring, but a cycle
determined entirely by the stacking order at the instant the
function is used.  E.g. CirculateDown takes the topmost window and
pushes it to the bottom, and CirculateUp takes the bottom-most
window and pulls it to the top.

In the virtual-mwm I've used (IXI Panorama) the definitions of
"topmost" and "bottom-most" get a bit confused, because *all* the
windows have a stacking order as if they were on a single desktop,
so you can end up circulating windows you can't see; but it still
works by instantaneous stacking order as far as I can tell.

Maybe it's different if you use click-to-focus rather than focus-
follows-pointer; when I use circulate, it's always from a root menu
or a root-window key binding, so the cursor is in the root and no
window has focus.

That reminds me of a related question:

When using focus-follows-pointer, Focus (e.g. from FvwmWinList)
warps the pointer to the upper left corner of the window frame.
Is there some way to get it to put the cursor actually inside the 
window, rather than on the frame?

Hm.  Well...  Initial placement offscreen?  I don't think there's
anything in fvwm that prevents this, but I've never had any problems
with windows being created (partially or fully) offscreen.  I think I
misunderstood you -- sorry.

Woa, I made another mistake here.  I was thinking of a different
function entirely.  So forget what I said.

  Bart> FvwmWinList) warps the pointer to the upper left corner of the

I use a function instead:

AddToFunc GoThere               "I" Iconify -1
+                               "I" Focus
+                               "I" CursorMove 3 3

Instead of using the Focus action, you just call this function.  Btw,
"CursorMove 3 3" means move 3% of the screen right and 3% down.

Hm.  My opinion is that there are some things that ctwm does better,
and that there are some things that fvwm does better.  I would
estimate them to be on par, overall.  Fvwm seems to see active
development, though, whereas ctwm kind of like stagnates, so that
might change.

  Mike> (though I don't find the FvwmWinList isn't quite as nice as

I use FvwmIconMan which does a creditable job of emulating the Icon
Manager of twm and friends.

That's just a simple typo in the .fvwm2rc provided:  Search for the
string "Restart fvwm" and replace it with "Restart fvwm2".  This is
the one spot where the renaming didn't seem to work...

  Mike> What I'm asking therefore is whether I should persevere with

I'm happy with 2.

Currently, FvwmPager uses about three colors: One for the background,
one for the foreground, and one for the highlighting.  Is this
correct?

In a non highlighted desk/page, the little windows can be seen only
because they have a border round them.  Is there any way of making
them have a different color than the little root windows?

To illustrate:

        Desk 1
    +-------------+
    |             |
    | +-------+   |
    | | (*)   |   |
    | +-------+   |
    |    (*)      |
    +-------------+

(*) These two areas should have different colors.

What I do is have separate files for colour, style, functions, popups, modules and the like.

I then use a central .fvwmrc file to read these files in at startup.

If I want to change a module's config, then I just edit its file and use the read command, either from a function or a FvwmTalk.

eg

AddToFunc CopyRead "I" Exec exec cp $HOME/.fvwm/$0 $HOME/.fvwm/$1
+		"I" Read .fvwm/$1

so goodstuff can be changed with this function:

CopyRead new_goodstuff  goodstuff


Hope this helps

Graeme

p.s. Chuck could it be possible to make Read default to first reading the directory where fvwmrc has been specified:

ie
my config is $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc

and I want read to start looking for files from $HOME/.fvwm

Hi,

I'm working on an fvwm 2.0 desktop based on my own photography/art
etc.... and calling it workspace.  I'd like to put up a web page on it
to show everyone what it looks like, but I have a problem... how do I
get a screendump of the screen WHILE the root window menu is popped up?
I'd like to show off the menus.

Also, anyone have a patch or is working on something that can embedd
xpm's into the title bar, or what would be really really sharp would be
to have an xpm image background in the titlebar with text overlayed.

Jim

In an xterm, do

	sleep 10; xwd -root

then you have 10 seconds to popup your menu.  Keep it open 'til you

Well, the next version (2.0.42) has support for pixmaps in title bar
buttons, courtesy of Andrew Veliath.

It'll be ready sometime this week hopefully.  It would have been ready
today, but I've encountered some problems (like problems w/ Jarl's new
FvwmButtons under AIX) and I have a few more things I'd like to get in
there that I didn't get a chance to finish this weekend.

Trial and error is it for now.  I'll be including a big list of sample
buttonstyles in the next version, one's that I've collected & created,
and more that someone (I forget who right now) posted here not to long
ago.  Then you can use these as a starting point for creating your
own.

xv has a grab w/ delay option that can be used to do this.

The next release (2.0.42) will have the ability to use xpm's as
titlebar buttons, but not as a background for the titlebar itself.

The background color of the miniature windows are grabbed from the
window itself.  For instance, typing this into FvwmTalk:

        Style "*" Color black/yellow
        Recapture

would cause all of the miniture windows in the pager to show up
yellow.

So, you should just be able to change the Background of FvwmPager or
the background of your non active windows to have it display as
different colors.

The only problem with this is that Exec doesn't wait for the process

On a related note, I want to make a second Exec function called
ExecAndWait which will pause until the child is done.  But this may be

By default it looks in $HOME first, then in FvwmDir.  So if you have
nothing in $HOME for it to find, you should be ok.

It would be pretty easy to have the read function look for an env var
called FVWMHOME or FVWMRCDIR or something like that, and look there
before the $HOME directory.  Might not be a bad idea.

That's what we're shooting for, while keeping fvwm as lightweight as
possible.

I would have to agree here.

I wouldn't say 'stagnates' but rather that ctwm is certainly more
stable than fvwm.

FvwmIconMan will be included in the next release (2.0.42), available

I'm taking care of this little problem for the next release too.  The

That's completely up to you.  The latest 2.xx should be good enough
for you to use every day without too many problems (I hope).  I'm
trying to prep it for the first official release of the 2.xx series.

Kai> I'm happy with 2.

Glad to hear that.

Yup.  It kinda goes along with my not feeling a need to support a
bunch of different window manager looks.  I just don't see a real
pressing need for it right now, although I do understand why you would
like it.

If you want to save the vertical space, you could just as easily use a
really small title font or shut off the titlebar completely.  If you
needed to find a window based on it's title, the builtin window list,
special Next/Prev keybindings, FvwmWinList, FvwmPager, or FvwmIconMan
could all do this nicely for you.  And you wouldn't be wasting any
horizontal space from a vertical titlebar either.

MK> Once it is stable, it could be kept in #ifdef's but wouldn't deviate from

I'd rather not do that either, because people who compiled it in would
be expecing 'official' support.  And what if some site didn't compile
it in, but one of their users wanted it because they heard about it
from somewhere, or saw a reference in the code or docs?

For now I think it should just remain a patch on Jarl's web page.

Suggestions so far:
  - use xv's Grab capability
  - use sleep + xwd -root in a shell

My suggestion:
  - use xgrab, by Bruce Schuchardt.

The sleep & xwd -root is awkward, as you'll get
the whole screen, and will probably have to trim it.

xv will work reasonably well; it doesn't have the extra options
that xgrab does but it'll do what you need. Although I haven't
tried it, xv's "AutoGrab" mechanism may work well to grab just
the menu. (It will probably not work very well for heirarchical
menus, though.)

My personal preference is xgrab (available from ftp.x.org contrib);
it has a nice GUI that lets you set sleep before and after; you can
grab windows, stretch a rectangle, or grab the whole screen. Output,
too, can be PostScript, xwd, ppm, or xpm.  It's a nice tool.

In any event, you'll have to either grab the whole screen (as per xwd)
or drag a rectangle out where you expect the menu to be. This is also
true for applications; grabbing the application window, even with a delay,

of the application's window).

Actually, you can pretty much do this right now (although it may not
be an entirely elegant solution).

To add to an existing menu on the fly, you can just call AddToMenu.
To recreate it you can call DestroyMenu, and then AddToMenu.

So, if you rewrote your .fvwm2rc file correctly (or safer, had a
separate file just for menu definitions), you could just reread it.

In fact, check out this.  In your ~/.fvwm2rc file you could have:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse 2 R MC DynamicMenu

AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title

AddToFunc DynamicMenu "I" DestroyMenu "DMenu"
+ "I" Read .fvwm2rc-dynmenu
+ "I" Popup DMenu
----------------------------------------------------------------------

And ~/.fvwm2rc-dynmenu could look like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title
+ "Rlogin" Module FvwmForm Rlogin
+ "QuitVerify" Module FvwmForm QuitVerify
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This binds Alt-Ctrl-MiddleMouse to this dynamic menu function.
Editing the file .fvwm2rc-dynmenu would result in an immediate change
when you pop up the menu next time with no fvwm commands needed on
your part.

Granted, if you haven't changed that file, it still does waste the
time of reading the file before popping up the menu, but with a not so
large menu this won't be too bad.  But if you used it to get the menu
to where you liked it and then just bound the resulting menu directly
instead of through this function, it wouldn't matter anyways.

I've been thinking about ways to add to & improve the module
interface, and this seems like it might be a good addition.  I've
added this idea to the TO-DO list.

I thought it would be useful to be able to send messages to a running
module to implement things like new & different menu styles in a
module (for those people who wanted different menu styles, like say
Pie menus) without bloating fvwm.  And as you (and others) started
pointing out, there could be other potential uses.

  I think it uses a few more colors. The window with focus gets colorized
  by HilightColor, i.e. background is the color of the active window
  border, label is the color of the text of the active window
  title. Windows without focus get colorized with a ForeColor/BackColor
  scheme.

  It must be that your default BackColor is very similar to FvwmPagerBack
  color.  Try making it different, or use a per class color, with something
  like:

    Style "XTerm" BackColor Pink

} I use a function instead:

I haven't tried this with 2.0 yet, but in 1.24r the CursorMove happens
only if the (un)Iconify does *not* happen.

} with windows being created (partially or fully) offscreen.

It happens most often with multi-window apps, when you drag one of the
windows to another part of the virtual desktop and then the window gets
closed for some reason while it's off-screen.  Re-opening that same
window then places it at the same relative geometry, i.e. offscreen
again.  This can be very confusing.

Actually in version 1.24 it's pretty easy to warp the pointer to the 
middle of the window, instead of the upper left corner. In v1.24 all you 
need to do is to locate the following line in functions.c:

    XWarpPointer(dpy, None, Scr.Root, 0, 0, 0, 0, x+2, y+2);
                                                  ^^^^^^^^
and change it to:

    XWarpPointer(dpy, None, Scr.Root, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                 x+t->frame_width/2, y+t->frame_height/2); 
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I just checked the source code of v2.0.41. The same piece of code is now
in builtins.c, but since it looks exactly the same as the corresponding
part in functions.c of v1.24, I guess the above modification would work
in 2.0 too.

	I'm new to the list but I do have a comment to make along
these lines...

	I have organised (well almost) my ~/.fvwm2rc so that it is a
minimal file, which reads a set of files from ~/.fvwm which define
functions, styles, keymaps, menus, modules and buttons (for
FvwmButtons module definitions, since I have a number of them!).  I
had intended to make use of the read command to enable me to implement
a 'reconfig' command, which would allow me to change configuration but
not have to do a restart, which takes ages, since all the modules have
to be restarted, and very likely only one has been modified.

	However I ran into a problem... While I could start a Menu
afresh (i.e. implemented a function NewMenu which destroys the old
instance first) there was now way to implement a NewFunc, which
resulted in all my functions being doubled up...

	So why isn't there a corresponding DestroyFunc command? And
infact it would make sense (or it seems so to me) that this should
exist and it maintains the orthogonality of the command syntax?
Things that are created can be destroyed.  On a similar note,
orthogonality would suggest that perhaps KillModule should be
DestroyModule?

	So again why is there no way to destroy an existing function
definition?

	I also second the suggestion of an FVWMHOME environment
variable.

The DestroyMenu directive destroys both menus and functions. The syntax is the
same. It isn't documented in the fvwm man page.

I agree about creating a DestroyFunc directive, even if it's just an alias of
some sort for DestroyMenu.

Actually I was wondering the same thing when I posted my suggestion
earlier...  I believe there should be and I'll see about getting one
in there for the next release.

Actually, the Menu and Function code are done via nearly the exact
same code, so the DestroyMenu will work to kill a function too.  I
just tested this to be sure.  I'll add DestroyFunc as an alias
essentially for it in the next release.  In the meantime DestroyMenu
should work for you.  If anyone finds problems with this, let me know.

I think I may end up putting this in there...

I think I recall someone once posting that DestroyMenu was supposed to
work on Functions too.  Then again I don't bother destroying anything
so it's not an issue for me :-)

If I'm correct in my guess above then DestroyMenu should be aliased to
DestroyFunc.

Agreed.

> DestroyModule?

I disagree.  Running a module involves starting a separate process.
On most, if not all, of the platforms that fvwm runs, the removal of
that process is referred to as killing.  Killmodule fits.  Menus and
functions are objects native to the fvwm process.  Destroy fits there.

But maybe there should be a DestroyModule function to destroy the definitions
for a module - so you don't end up with doubled FvwmForms and FvwmButtons?

Haven't experimented much with rereading yet, so maybe this is no problem?

If that's what he meant, then I retract my statement.  However, I was
under the impression he simply meant renaming KillModule.  Even if we
do get a DestroyModule that removes module definitions, we'd still
need KillModule around for stopping Module processes.

First of all, thanks for all the positive feedback on the titledown patch.
I do understand why Chuck doesn't want it in fvwm though, and it probably
doesn't belong there anyway. (Even though it really is a small patch and 
has more right-to-live than, say, MwmBorders. Just IMHO ofcourse :-) )

On a sidenote, from now on, in an attempt to reduce bloating of fvwm, I 
will supplement all my patches with a patch that rewrites/optimizes fvwm
so that the total size goes down. I challenge everyone else who makes 
patches to do this too.

Chuck:

I must say I have to agree. Actually I now prefer running fvwm without
any decorations at all, with just lots of slick mouse+modifier bindings.
Even on 1152x800. But it doesn't _look_ very fancy though, and, well, the
fancy things are the funniest to code :-)

--

I have been investigating the possibility of making the titledown patch a
module (FvwmDecor?), where we could also put all the fancy extensions that
have been suggested for titlebars/buttons. But there are a number of 
problems
 1) It would have to be able to get a lot of info from fvwm, mainly
    WindowFont, Titlestyle, Buttonstyles, bindings to buttons and titlebar
    and border...
 2) Some way of trigging a complex function from the module must be invented.
 3) There will be _a lot_ of code duplication from fvwm. Can be somewhat 
    remedied by moving more code into fvwmlib.

The most important issue is how the fvwm protocol must be extended to make
1 possible. 
Currently most modules use the GetConfigLine() fvwmlib function to get their
config, this sends all the config lines fvwm has stored that starts with a
"*", and also the following three settings: IconPath, PixmapPath, ClickTime.
(fvwm assumes these are the only three settings modules should need to know)
What if this function could be called with a prefix, and any line starting
with that prefix would be returned? Thus you could have
  GetConfigLine("*FvwmModule",...) to get all the config lines for that module
(and not have to go through all the other modules' definitions), and then
  GetConfigLine("PixmapPath",...) and GetConfigLine("ButtonStyle",...) and
any setting you would like your module to know.
GetConfigLine() uses the M_CONFIG_INFO request, so the relevant protocol
change would be to add a parameter to this and only return matching lines.
Of course, to be able to return any config line, fvwm would have to cache
the entire config, not only those related to modules.

Number 2 should be easy to implement, when a module sends a request for a
function, some more effort should be put into creating the fake buttonpress
event that is sent to the complexfunction. I tried to do this the same way
the Popup modification was done, but a little more insight is obviously needed.

Any ideas? Chuck, is this implementable?

--

And I still think PixmapPath should be removed completely, leaving only
IconPath.

Someone showed me a very nice feature in Windows95 I though would
translate well to FvwmButtons. Basically, the Win 95 taskbar can be set
to only appear when the mouse is moved to the bottom of the screen.
After the mouse leaves the taskbar, it disappears a few seconds later.
Does anyone else thing this could be useful? How hard would it be to add
to FvwmButtons?

	I agree... My meaning was ambiguous.  As Jarl suggests I was
interested in destroying the Module definition, but was (stupidly)
considering including this to be associated with KillModule, which in
hindsight is NOT a good idea!

	So yes I do want a way to destry the definition of a Module,

I've seen something similar on the Mac - this would be a really good
idea.  I've got FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan in corners, and it would be
excellent if they could "auto-rise" when I put the cursor in the
respective corner.  It would also be nice if FvwmButtons menus could
auto-rise.  C'est possible?

Best appreciation to all fvwm developers

The region would have to be well defined though, because nothing would
bother me more, that using the pointer to highlight some text from the
bottom of a window, and having my button bar popping up over the text.

PS: another feature which I like from the mac's was that if you threw
the pointer to the bottom left corner of the screen, that the
screensaver would startup right away - combine that with locking, it
would be a nice way to leave your workstation - but the pointer has to
be at +0-0 for the feature to start up. any takers?

Take a look at xautolock.  I've been using it and it works great.  Not
only does it allow you to do the above, but it also starts xlock (or any
other screensaver for that matter) after a predetermined time of non-
activity.

xautolock does what you need. Find it at ftp.x.org in
/contrib/applications/xautolock.pl10.tz. You can specify which locker to
use (xlockmore in the same directory is a good choice) and when to lock
the screen: after inactivity or when the mouse pointer is in a certain
corner. Which corner(s) you want to use is also a preference.
I don't think this should be a feature of the window manager...

In fvwm 2.0.41, there some strange things happen with the -h and
-version switches:

% fvwm -h  
[FVWM] [
Fvwm Version %s Usage:

]:  2.0.41
[FVWM] [  %s [-d dpy] [-debug] [-f config_cmd] [-s] [-blackout] [-version] [-h]
]:  fvwm

I think ths is due to the use of fvwm_msg, whereas printf would
suffice.

% fvwm -version
Fvwm Version 2.0.41 compiled on Mar 14 1996 at 18:13:37
[FVWM] [CatchRedirectError]: <<ERROR>> another WM is running

I think fvwm should not try to start when -version is invoked, but
rather exit immediately.

I use the xautolock to get this function.  It has worked well with fvwm since

Personally, I use Xscreensaver from Jamie Zawinski (jwz@netscape.com,
http://www.netscape.com/people/jwz/), which you can pick up from ftp.x.org
somewhere.  It comes with a separate program that can be used to immediately
activate the screensaver.  Bind this program to a Function key, and just
hit that key when you have to leave.  It's pretty handy.

Get a copy of xautolock from any X mirror. It already does this and
more. I used it all the time until I got a video card that XFree
supported in green mode.

  This is very picky :-).

  When one's desktop is Nx1, vertical page scrolling is not possible. If
  one moves the mouse against the top or bottom edges of the screen it just
  gets stuck there. If one then moves left of right toward either of the
  sides, making sure that we're still against the top or bottom, horizontal
  paging will not happen.

  The reason for this is that the pan frames, four skinny invisible windows
  that form a border around the screen do not overlap at the corners, with
  the horizontal edge windows reaching the sides, and the vertical edge
  windows stuck in between them. If one makes those windows overlap,
  i.e. extend the vertical edge windows over the horizontal edge windows,
  reaching the edges, this side-effect goes away.

  I can't seem to find out a problem with this one (but I've been running
  with this for only 5 minutes :-), with the possible exception that cursor
  displayed in the corner regions being wrong, and only during the edge
  resistance period.

  The reason this is very picky is that it is very hard to get stuck in
  that corner region, at least with an accelerate mouse like mine.

Hello,

I've seen a popup-patch on Jarl's page, but I don't see how to use it...
Could you (Jarl or anyone else) explain the syntax to popup a menu from
a module.

I hacked fvwm to make it parse "Popup "Menu" x y , popping up a menu at
absolute coordinate x,y. Does this patch allow the same ?

Thanks

my suggestion for a to-do in fvwm 2.0 is a dynamic icon bar which changes
depending on which icon you push. This way, you can establish a nested
tree-like structure of icons.  If you click on System Setup icon, the
vertical bar changes into icons for setup with new icons such as: RAM,
disk, cache, etc. Click on Networking and the icons get replaced with
icons pertainting to network setup

does this make sense?

Surely you can do this already by just binding 

Module SetupBar

to a button push? With SetupBar a symbolic link to FvwmButtons but with a 
seperate set of actions defined. I guess you could have it call a function and
kill the old bar first.  With Jarl's buttons this is even easier as you can 
define as many button-bars as you like and give them all their own setup files.

I have a patch on my web page, allowing a module to invoke a popup menu.

It's not perfect, as I realize it breaks menus placement like the
WinList. But I wondered if the design was suitable for fvwm.
Mainly the changes involved :

* builtins.c : parse a Popup function to look for additional coordinates
               (using GetTwoArgs)

* menus.h : adding to fields x,y in the MenuRoot structure (waste space
I know)

* menu.c : try to place the menu with coordinate information as weel as
possible. the traditionnal Button1 Root menu works, but not
the Winlist. (I'll see that asap)

* module.h : added a M_FUNCTION_END message to send at the end of
             ExecuteFunction. This allows feedback to a module. I did
             that to know when to depress sort of a Start button on my
             taskbar, but it can provide usefull information for a
             general purpose module.

* module.c : send the M_FUNCTION_END message

If your're interested, see my web page and try the patch.

The syntax is the normal 'Popup Somemenuname', but for the menu to popup
automatically the pointer has to be free, i.e. if you want to get the popup
on a ButtonPress, you have to do an XUngrabPointer and then do a SendInfo()
to fvwm. If you wait for a ButtonRelease first it will not work.

No, my patch just puts the menu where the pointer is.

It's similar to something we have on our motion controllers called
"softkeys".  On the far left is an up arrow to go back up a level, and
on the far right is a right arrow to display more keys on the same
level.  Once a key is pressed, a new set of keys are displayed.

It might be a little overkill for xterms, but good luck implementing
it. :)

Are Jarl's buttons in the standard release?  I just saw something about
the vertical title bar not being put in the other day.  Now I'm
wondering how much of the stuff that you all have been talking about is
based on patches that will never be a part of any official release.

On the subject of all the features, I've neve done more than a little
messing with my pager, adding to menus, and using iconboxes.  I thought
iconboxes would be boxes that you could pop to see all your icons.  It
took me a long time to figure out that there was no box, just a region
of the screen for putting your icons.

So, what I"m saying is, even with all the excellent documentation that
comes with fvwm, I haven't gotten into any customization involving most
of the other modules, e.g., Fvwm{Audio,Banner,Backer,Buttons,}.

Is there at any site sample snappshots of just what these things do for
me, so I could get excited about doing a little work on my .fvwmrc file?


thanks,

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

The following is a patch (and somewhat of a hack with the NoClass and
NoResource strings) to allow conditions like !Fvwm*. Specifically I
use key definitions like: 

Key Prior       A       M       Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !Fvwm*] Focus
Key Next        A       M       Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !Fvwm*] Focus
Key Prior       A       MC      Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk !Fvwm*] Focus
Key Next        A       MC      Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk !Fvwm*] Focus

Which allows me to cycle through the windows on the current screen (or
all windows on the current desk) but ignoring the FVWM windows like
FvwmButtons. 

The solution to the hack on NoClass and NoResource would be to make
them global variables throughout libfvwm.a, but I wasn't that
ambitious. 

Maybe somebody will like this.

BTW: I'm not subscribed to this mailing list, so you'll have to
contact me directly if you want to suggest changes to the patch.

I've also seen this with fvwm-1.24r.  It seems related to stopping the fvwm
process.  For instance, in my .xsession, I am starting fvwm in the background
and the last line in the .xsession file is a foreground xterm.  When I logout
of the xterm, I expect the fvwm process to die, too.  Sometimes it does;
sometimes it doesn't.

When fvwm does not exit, it goes into some runaway mode.  The next time I
login, my .xsession starts a new fvwm process. Now I have one runaway (from
previous login) and this new fvwm process.  If I don't manually kill the old
process, it just sits there consuming CPU cycles (and upsets a lot of my
colleagues!)

Has anyone found a solution to this or know the cause? 

Thanks,

Mark_Naumann-rysw20@email.mot.com

For me (2.0.41 on linux) it is not an old fvwm2 process, but the
current one, that zooms up to load 1.0 until I restart fvwm2.  This
happens quite frequently.  Now, I faily often kill and start a module
(in this case tkgoodstuff, which runs as a module using tkfvwm).  This
may have something to do with it, but fvwm2's load doesn't go down
when the module is killed.  (Could it be something about paying
respects to dead modules?)  Since I produce this effect pretty
reliably (twice this afternoon), I'd be happy to do a little
debugging, if told what to do...

Tired of "Read Xpm Error: Failed to parse or alloc some color"?
Tired of having your netscape resort to use 4 colors because all of
your fancy set of icons have a different shade of blue in it, thus 
using up all colormap entries? Now there is an answer!
Romano Giannetti and Martin Kraemer are proud to announce the
release of pixy in his latest version 3.2!!

What is pixy? 

Pixy is a little program to reduce the number of colors of a set of pixmap
files to a fixed predefined set of colors.

Often, especially with the recent xpm-icon capable window managers like
fvwm, people have the problem that their color map is almost full after
starting the window manager, thus preventing other applications from
using a
sensible number of still available colors. Of course, this is mostly a
problem with 8-bit deep displays; they have only 256 available colors in
their color palette. 

Where I find it?

Primary site is ftp://sirio.iet.unipi.it/pub/romano/pixy3.2.tar.gz, but this
is a little PC and anonymous ftp throughput is severely limited in it. 
For some time it will be mirrored by Martin on 
ftp://ftp.mch.sni.de/incoming/Martin.Kraemer/pixy-3.1.tar.gz

I will upload it to sunsite.unc.edu and some other wide-band server as 
soon as possible. (My network connection with USA is not working 
now). Everyone that can offer a better site is welcome.

LSM follows:

Hello all.  I was asked by one of our unix adminstrators to send him an email
as to why Fvwm is cool, what is so special about it, what makes it better than
or equal to other window managers, etc.  Basically, why should he take up
diskspace on it.

Unfortunately, I use Fvwm because it's cool, and I can't really provide a
solid argument as to why it should be there with the other window managers,
because I never have used any other window manager.

So, if somebody could give me a few pointers to put in an email, I would
greatly appreciate it.

Well, it uses very little memory and yet still allows a virtual desktop,
and allows the user to refine the setup to his/her own preferences very
easily, thus providing a more user friendly working environment...
Oh yeah, it ran on my NCD terminal when olvwm wouldn't.
  
But basically it's just really cool... ;-)

I asked my users, and they said:

1) Low overhead. It uses less memory than most other window
manager. That's important when your workstation only has 16mb of RAM.

2) Built-in Features, such as virtual desktops, icon boxes, and a 3D
look and feel.

3) Functionality. There are three aspects of FVWM that really shine:
     
     Configuration: FVWM's behavior can be altered to fit most
     anyone's needs. 

     Ease of configuration: a simple rc file, rather than resources
     (this might be personal to me; most of the users that I support
     are not X-literate, and resource files are more difficult for
     them to understand than fvwmrc, apparently.)

     Extendablity: FVWM's "module" approach allows you to pick and
     choose which special features you might want, without paying the
     penalty in RAM and code complexity. The tkfvwm module pushes this
     even further, making it very easy to create new modules (at least
     conceptually.)

4) Besides, it's cool. ;)

Howdy all.

Just thought I'd let you all know that 2.0.42 isn't going to make it
out this week.  Sorry, but I've hit some snags with the large number
of fixes and updates I'm trying to get in there...

I'll be working a lot this weekend on it though, so hopefully early
next week.

I tend to be somewhat anal about where my windows go, but it is tiresome
placing the windows manually (I'm not so anal that I have aliases and scripts
to place them for me, although I suppose it could be done). So how does this
sound: A LastPlacement option, like SmartPlacement and RandomPlacement, which
places a window in the same location as the last instance of it, or has you
manually place it if this is the first invocation of it. Obviously, not too
useful for things like xterm, but I would like it for things that I only ever
have one of, such as workman, xcalc, xman, xv, editres, xpaint, nethack, etc.

I see two potential problems. First, can we add another style without
problems? I remember reading that fwvm has run out of bits. Second, what
information do we store. The class and resource names don't change, but the
icon and title names sure do, and the styles match against all of them.
Probably just remember the values the window had when it was destroyed. Also,
it would probably be wise to cap the number of window types which get
remembered, in case someone for some reason is doing something weird like
running programs with classnames "xterm.1", "xterm.2", "xterm.3" etc. 

As for how the style command does its matching, I do have a problem with that. 
I would much prefer the ability to specify which one of {class, resource,
title, icon} the regular expressions are matched against. I used to have a
like "Style "Fvwm*" ..." to match all fvwm modules in one shot, but that was
bad if I had an emacs window editing FvwmIconMan.c while I restarted fvwm. The
syntax FvwmIconMan uses is: type=regexp where type is one of {class, resource,
title, icon} and regexp is the regular expression, or just the regular
expression, in which case it matches everything.

Does anybody see a reason why I should not go ahead and implement these?

Hi, here's a patch to 2.0.41 for using 24-bit ppms as icon files. This
has only been tested on a 24-bit truecolor visual; chances are that it'll
work on a 16-bit visual. It almost definitively won't work on a 8-bit
visual. #define PPM needs to be somewhere, I put it in configure.h.
Enjoy!
