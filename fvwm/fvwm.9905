Hi, All ...

     Quick question.  I'm using a virtual 2x2 desktop.
 How, using what commands can I tell X-Terminal which
desktop I want it to load on.  (ie. I want to load one
on desktop 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2; but not 2x1).  Can this
be done?  If so, can someone give me the command?

Thanks,

===

Assuming you have a seperate terminal for each configuration you want. You
must edit your .fvwm2rc file, there should be a line somewhere in it
looking something like this 

DeskTopSize 3x2

just change the params to 1x1 or 1x2 etc

I hope this is what you want ??

  <Ahem>  "RTFM".

  (BTW, I believe the pages start at '0' not '1').

  To quote man fvwm2:


     Some applications that understand standard Xt  command  line
     arguments  and  X  resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow
     the user to specify the start-up desk or page on the command
     line:

          xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"

     will start an xterm on desk number 1;

          xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"

     will start an xterm two pages to the right and one down from
     the  upper left hand page of desk number 3. Not all applica-
     tions understand the use of these options, however.


  Mind you, I've not tried that myself ... and you may be able to omit the
desk number as you can with StartsOnPage.

  I'd like to be able to, e.g., iconise all Netscape windows (or xterms,
etc.).

  Is there currently a way of iterating 'Next'? Maybe even in a shell
script using FvwmCommand and/or PipeRead?

  I'm thinking along the lines of an 'All' sibling to Next/Prev, or maybe
even a paramter to WindowList ...

  Yes, I've looked in the FM :)

The All command is not in version 2.2, it's in the current beta versions
and very handy it is too.  You'll probably want "All (Netscape*) Iconify
On"

Cheers,

I suggest you try using the 'All' sibling to Next/Prev ;-) It's
already there.

  Some of us can't remote-CVS through our firewalls :-(

  However, I've just noticed the 2.3.1 tarball, so I'll fetch that!

Sorry, I thought it was in 2.2 already. Don't expect too much of
2.3.1. You're probably better off with today's snapshot.

	Yes, you can. "*Page: 2 1" will give you this relative page positioning
on the current desktop. (The full resource name is actually
"Fvwm.Page".)

	Also, in most cases you'd probably want to set a style like

Style "xterm" SkipMapping

to avoid warping to each desktop in turn as these xterms are started up.
At least I would find that annoying.

	Brian -- you didn't tell us what release of FVWM you're using. This
technique that Neil describes requires 2.2 or later. If you're using
2.0.46, there's a patch available to implement StartsOnPage.

	If you're using version 1, you're out of luck. You have to use the old
hack of specifying geometries on the command line to position the
windows beyond the boundaries of the currently visible viewport (page),
and it only works if you are on page 0,0 (upper left hand corner) when
you start them. (And, frankly, I won't guarantee that it works at all:
version 1 hasn't been actively supported for a long time.)

That's the reason a complete checkout from CVS (updated every three hours)
is on the FTP site.  You can mirror it and pretend you have CVS access.
(Well, you can't do nice things like cvs diff, but you can get the same
sources that the developers work with.)

It's also the reason a complete distribution is built out of CVS once per
day and placed on the FTP site.  Look in the devel subdirectory.

Okay, folks.. this may well be a Netscape bug, but I thought I'd ask.

Linux (RH5.1 at the moment), fvwm2 1.46 I think, NS 4.005.
ClickToFocus.

The WindowList shows, say Xterms as window 1 and 3, Netscape as window 2.
Focus on Netscape.  Alt/L - goto URL dialog comes up - type type type,
Enter - dialog goes away AND FOCUS RETURNS TO WINDOW 1, NOT TO NETSCAPE.
Maddening.  Any solution?

  thanks,
  Phil

	That's odd, because I couldn't reproduce the problem, using last
night's CVS.

	I concluded that this had to be caused by one of two things. Either
there's a mix of ClickToFocus and MouseFocus windows (the mouse cursor
is resting atop a MouseyFocus window when the transient disappears), or
Phil clicked on the xterm-1 window while the transient NS dialogue was
up, altering the order of the last-focused chain.

	Phil -- is either of these the case in your situation?

	Dominik -- I see what you did to change this behavior. I'm not sure I'm
100% convinced that it's always what is wanted in case number 2. I can
easily picture a case where it is not.

	Say I have a window like the one I'm typing this message in at the
moment, which covers most of Netscape's browser window. Suppose that the
message I'm replying to contains a couple of URL's that I want to check.
I click File->Open Page in the browser window. I don't force windows to
raise on the focus click, so the window I'm typing in isn't obscured.
The transient dialogue appears, I select the URL and paste it into the
dialogue, and hit enter. I'd really rather have focus return to the
window I was typing in while NS loads that graphics-laden,
singing-dancing page over a slow link.

	It's sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, because
we can't really know for sure just which window a user considers the
most important at the moment - particularly if he has oddball habits
like mine.

	For the mouse-focus case, I suppose this is the more intuitive way to
behave - I only use Mouse/SloppyFocus occasionally, so I'm not a good
judge.

	I guess we'll just have to see over the next few days whether anyone
finds this a significant annoyance, in which case it should probably be
made optional.

Upgrade fvwm to version 2.2.  It's a feature of fvwm before 2.2 that the
internal window list order depends on the order of creation of windows. 
After 2.2 to list is kept in most recently focussed order so that
closing windows does the right.

Cheers,
Tim.

In any case, a transient being closed should transfer the focus back
to its 'parent'.

I *am* sure I'm not 100% convinced :-) It won't work if the focus transfers
from one transient to another of the same application. Perhaps we should
check not only if the last focused window is the transientfor window but
also if the last focused window has the same transientfor window.

Well, try it and see if it bothers you. If it does we can make another
style option.

Whit mouse/sloppy focus this can't happen. If the pointer is over some
different window than the transient with the focus this must be because
the focus was grabbed by the transient. This can only happen with the
focus on its 'parent' (at least with yesterday's patch). In this case
the user will most likely expect to get the focus back where it was.

Yup.

	Hmm...my recollection is that this change was to get rid of the
discrepancy between ClickToFocus and MouseFocus handling. I believe that
the list order was changed for ClickToFocus windows, but got into a
horrible muddle if you had a combination of click focus and mouse focus
windows. I don't recall having this problem under 2.0.4x.

Only if you want it to. Could we make this a style option?

In mousefocus mode you can still change focus without using the mouse. 
I use the Direction function to do this and you don't have to warp the
mouse. So it is possible to have the mouse over one window with the
focus on another (possibly transient) window.  In this case closing the
focus window should switch back to the mouse-containing window
(probably).

Cheers,
Tim.

Sorry, again.  I was reporting the symptoms inaccurately.  In fact, in the
situation I'm describing, NO window has focus.  And it doesn't always
happen, and I haven't been able to determine when it will or won't.

But more broadly, here's the deal.  I despise Microsoft and all their
works, but one thing they got right was the idea that everything should
have keyboard equivalents (though they've broken this more and more).
I like the focus behavior of Winblows (well, except when a background
application puts up a dialog and grabs focus for itself, perhaps taking
some keystrokes that weren't meant for it).  I want my fingers on the
keyboard, and although I can use Alt/Tab to get the focus back where I
want it, I'd rather not if it can be avoided.

By the way, speaking of mouse-free operation: I see how fvwm2 can be
taught to make key combinations move the cursor - but can any keyboard
action be made equivalent to a button click?  (Just curiosity - I don't
insist on _never_ touching the rodent - and indeed the cut and paste
behavior is much nicer than Winblows.)

I _will_ upgrade pretty soon ;-)

This has been brought up in the past.

Right now, fvwm2 doesn't have a way to convert keystokes into
button pushes.  Even if it did, applications will be able to tell
the difference. (They are marked as "synthetic"). Some applications
may refuse to accept them.  (Its a security issue.)

I would imagine that a patch would be accepted...

Can you please explain me how this option SkipMapping is useful.
An example will be very useful. I checked the max page, it is very brief.

	Normally when a window is created on a desktop or page other than the
current one, FVWM switches to that desktop/page. SkipMapping prevents
this: your viewport doesn't change when the new window is created. So,
you can continue working in some other app while the new one - Netscape,
for example - takes its sweet time starting up. And you can take your
sweet time about switching to the page with the new app - when you're
good and ready.

	Now, in Brian's case, which started this discussion, he wants to start
up several xterms - I presume all at the same time, at startup. Without
using the SkipMapping style, FVWM would be ping-ponging back and forth
among different pages untill all these windows got mapped. It's really a
pretty ugly sight.

Instead  of xsetroot, use "xv"  with the "-root" option, or xloadimage
(aka xli) with the "-onroot" option.

Really?  Consider the informational `download status' windows of
Netscape.  I'd be rather surprised if the finishing of a download
moved focus away from whatever I was using at that time.

But maybe these `download status' windows aren't transient.

But if they are, I'm really unsure what should be done about it.
OT1H, after hitting the OK button in an `enter search string' Netscape
window, I surely want focus to return to the parent.  OTOH, there's
this `download status' thing.  And then, there are the authentication
popups from Netscape -- I find that I sometimes tell Netscape to go to
a URL and go back to my mail reader.  After some time, an
authentication window pops up.  I enter the data, hit RET, and
continue to read mail for a while, since I know that the page will
take some time to be downloaded completely.

Hm.

Maybe it is safest to return focus to the window that had focus before
the transient appeared.

Whatcha think?

AFAIK, they aren't. Try the following simple experiment: start a download,
then close all other windows. The download continues until the end, then the
program exits. I don't think it would do that if the download window was a
transient.

> Whatcha think?

In my opinion, on the closure of a transient, if fvwm can't deduce the new
focus from the mouse position[1], it should move to the parent of the
transient. This will occasionally do "the wrong thing" for people with
click-to-focus on and auto-raise off, but it serves them right for mixing
their metaphors.


[1] ie. ClickToFocus is on, or SloppyFocus is on and the mouse pointer is
over the root window.

I've not been following this dialogue carefully, and I think I have heard
the answer I would give to this issue.  But I'll say it explicitly in case
I am wrong:

The focus change should only happen if the "transient"  window is the one
which already _has_ the focus.  If it doesn't then no refocus should
occur.  None of the issues I have noticed being discussed would be
answered wrongly with this.

Well having become a lazy soul and bored with reloading my menu file
every time I made a quick change like adding a new theme file, so  I
made a quick function to do that everytime the root menu is brought up.
However now the problem I have is that menu only stays up so long as I
hold down the mouse button.  It's not real big problem since I usually
do it this way anyway.  After checking through the man pages and docs I
haven't see anyone else do this or any better what to do this.  However
I am curious as to why it would do this and how I could go about fixing
it.  Here are the relevant parts of my config.

AddToFunc Menu
+               "I" Read .fvwm/menu
+               "I" Popup Utilities

Mouse 1         R       A       Function Menu
Mouse 2         R       A       Menu "Window-Ops" Nop
Mouse 3         R       A       WindowList NoGeometry

I am also running the latest cvs version as of this morning if this
makes any difference.

Eek.  I missed that one.  Thanks for clearing this up.  Thus, my
posting is bogus.

Dear all,

I am trying to figure out how to bind a key to restart fvwm.  I have
experimented with a few configurations but what it does is exit X all
together uncleanly.  

Key F13         A       C       Restart fvwm

Any good soul to give a hint on how to do this?  

Thanks,

Dominic.

>From the fvwm2 man page:

              Popup differs from Menu in that pop-ups do not stay
              up  if the user simply clicks.  These are Twm style
              popup-menus, which are a little hard on the  wrist.
              Menu  provides  Motif  or  Microsoft-Windows  style
              menus which will stay up on a  click  action.   See
              menu   for   an   explanation  of  the  interactive
              behaviour of menus.

I think you should use 

+		"I" Menu Utilities

and you'll get the behaviour you expect.

>From ye olde fvwm 1 manual:

       Restart  name WindowManagerName
              Causes  fvwm to re-read itself if WindowManagerName
              = fvwm, or to switch to an alternate window manager
              if  WindowManagerName  != fvwm.  If the window man-
              ager is not in your default search path,  then  you
              should  use  the  full path name for WindowManager-
              Name.
	      
              WindowManagerName  is  not  quoted,  but  name  is.
              name is the name that appears in a menu, if that is
              where the function is called from. name is required
              even if the function is not called from a menu, for
              ease of parsing.
								    

              This command should not have a  trailing  ampersand
              or  any command line arguments, and should not make
              use of any environmental variables. Of the  follow-
              ing  examples, the first three are sure losers, but
              the third is OK:
		
              Key F1 R N Restart " " fvwm &
              Key F1 R N Restart " " $(HOME)/bin/fvwm
              Key F1 R N Restart " " twm -f .mystartupfile
              Key F1 R N Restart " " /home/nation/bin/fvwm

So, it looks like your problem is missing the " " which is required to parse
the line properly. It looks like you're using the syntax for fvwm2. Check
that it's the fvwm version 1 man page you're looking at... on my machine it
has FVWM(1.2) at the top rather than FVWM(2.xx), and it has a headline
"SPECIAL NOTE FOR XFREE86 USERS" on the first page, which has been removed
from the fvwm2 man pages.

All this comes with a big disclaimer that I haven't used fvwm version 1 in
about 3 years and it isn't really "supported" any more. Actually, perhaps
there should be a seperate mailing list for it, given that it is still
useful as one of the "lightest" configurable window managers out there.

Hi,

  I'm seeing some interesting iconification behavior in fvwm 2.2.  I hope
I can explain it clearly.  (My apologies if this has already been
reported.)

  Suppose I have a window on a given page.  Now, I drag it toward the edge
of the screen, so that more than 50% of its height or more than 50% of its
width (or both) is unviewable.  Now, I perform an Iconify on said window.
Depending on where it's hanging off of the current page, the window
iconifies onto another (adjacent) page, and in some cases iconifies into
thin air!

There are far too many cases to list, but I'll quickly go over my
findings.  I have a 7x7 desktop.  I call the 6x6 middle pages of my
desktop the 'internal' pages on my desktop.  For any 'internal' page, I've
found that if the window is hanging more than 50% of the way off of the
_____ edge(s), then the window will iconify on the page _____ the current
page:

left              :  to the left of
right             :  to the right of
top               :  above
bottom            :  below
left and top      :  to the left of and above
right and top     :  to the right of and above
left and bottom   :  to the left of and below
right and bottom  :  to the right of and below

This is at least consistent.  :-)

For non-internal pages on my desktop, it's pretty much up for grabs where
the icon goes upon iconification.  In my investigation, I've found that
symmetric cases do not necessarily lead to symmetric results -- for
example, iconifying a window hanging off the left edge of any leftmost
page will cause the icon to appear on the current page (good!), but
iconifying a window hanging off the right edge of any rightmost page will
result in the icon disappearing into thin air, only to be retrieved via
the Window List (bad!).  It's too much typing for me to list other cases,
so I will only do that if I'm begged to.  :-)

  My guess is that this is sufficient information to track down the
problem, and that it will hopefully have an easy fix that will take care
of the more complicated examples that I am omitting.  Or even better, it
would be nice if this problem was spotted and fixed already.  In that
case, I apologize for the redundancy.  :-)  Please feel free to contact me
if you need anything clarified.

Cheers,
-jason

Is there an option (like in MWM) that makes a new window automatically size
or fit itself to the screen, so it doesn't extend onto other desktops?

Hello.

I use FVWM2 and the KDE file manager.  As KFM is a single-click browser
I have configured FVWM2 to be single-clickable as well.  This works OK,
except you need a very steady hand to deiconify an icon with a single
click.

This is because the hard-wired three pixel thresholds in
function.c:IsClick() are too small.

The attached patch against fvwm-snap-19990511 makes this distance
configurable (default is still three).  The .fvwm2rc syntax is

MoveDistance 9

I hope I did the diff thing right...

BTW: which Makefile target cleans _everything_ into a diffable form???


Bug reports on fvwm-snap-19990511:

1: I get "Some command line modules have not quit, Starting up after
timeout.`" and a long hang at startup

2: When I run KFM, KFM's icons are _always_ on top of FVWM's windows.


System info:

Pretty stock RedHat 5.2/x86

Andrew.

It's not a bug, it's a feature.  What's the command line you start fvwm
with?  If it has any modules on it other than FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp then you
should be getting a pause. Modules other than FvwmM4 and FvwmCpp should
be started in the .fvwm2rc file (preferably in the InitFunction so you
can re-read the file to pick up any changes without starting a second
copy of the modules). See question 4.3 in the FAQ that comes with the
snapshot.  If you aren't starting any modules with the fvwm command line
then it may be a bug.

Cheers,
Tim.

The only 'real' problem I see is the case where the window simply vanishes.
All other cases were intended by the person that wrote the code in the first 
place. Anyway, this has been changed in the development sources. Now, whenever
at least a single pixel of the window is visible it will iconify on the 
current page. That may not help with the vanishing window. I will check and
fix this problem.

Thanks for the excellent problem report. This is the quality that saves
us much time (which we can spend on new features).

Do you want to make windows smaller so that they fit nicely on a single page?
Could you explain in detail where the problem lies so that we can better judge
if some built in mechanism suffices or if new code is needed?

Possible solutions:

 - make the window fit on the page exactly

     Resize 100 100

 - make the window fill the available space without overlapping other windows
   (This is a recent change in the development sources, not available in the
   2.2 release)

     Resize grow grow

 - clip the window to page boundaries when it is created

     not possible at the moment

Sounds like a good enhancement. I'll rename it to 'MoveThreshold' however.
And you forgot menus. The same value is used there. Don't care to send
the patch again, I know where the changes have to be done.

There is none, I think. 'make distclean' may help, but it forces you to
run 'configure' and 'make' again.

Oops, I wanted to ask you something in the first place (I'm just curious):
Why is three pixels not enough? I could imagine a number of reasons:

 - very sensitive mouse acceleration/speed
 - large screen resolution
 - shaky hand
 - you're using a trackball and keep the hand on the ball while pressing
   the button
 - ...

ctwm has a MaxWindowSize option and makes larger windows smaller.  I
think this applies to newly created windows as well as already
existing windows.  Here's the relevant man page excerpt:

,----- from ctwm man page
|      MaxWindowSize string
|              This variable specifies  a  geometry  in  which  the
|              width  and  height give the maximum size for a given
|              window.  This is typically used to restrict  windows
|              to   the   size  of  the  screen.   The  default  is
|              "30000x30000".
`-----

Dunno if this is what Josh wants, but maybe it is.

Hi, All ...

    Quick question about key bindings (Yes, I've RTFM, and maybe I'm just
too thick, but I didn't find what I needed).

    I want to remap the keys on my right key pad (7-3).  On the Sun systems,
using CDE, this is done by changing the bindings on R11 through R19.  What I
can to do it make it so that when I hit the #7 on my right keypad, I will be
taken to +0+0.  When I hit the #9 key, I will be taken to +1024+0, #1 will
take me to +0+1024, and #3 will take me to +1024+1024.

    If this is doable, would someone please post the modification to the
.fvwm2rc to accomplish this?

Thanks,

Brian

Hello all!

At first, I'm sorry for my bad English.

At second, I understand, that version 2.3.1 is beta. ;)

I have serveral problems.

1. When I press "Start" button in FvwmTaskBar, location of start menu
is wrong. This location must will be above TaskBar window. Instead
this, lower left corner of menu is position mouse cursor.

In fvwm 2.1.7, in my config file, construction

*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu StartMenu 0p -25p

worked fine. Lower left corner menu was been placed in +0-25 at
root window. In fvwm 2.2 and above, this construction not worked.

Follow construction

*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu StartMenu root 0p -25p

is not works.

Help me, please.


2. I defined StartMenu as

AddToMenu "StartMenu@fvwm-menu.xpm@^#808080^"
+ ...

With these settings, background color of pixmap field must will be
#808080. However, I don't see it. Instead this, I see gray color of
background menu.

In fvwm 2.2 it worked fine. Where is problem? Help me, please.

With best wishes,
Victor Vislobokov

Perm, Russia.

What I want basically is the window to automatically be clipped, at least
horizontally (sp?) just so that my long thin windows don't extend off the end
of the screen.  I use special software and have this problem a good bit.  Thanks,

I could have been misleading people.  I normally run fvwm2-2.2-1 and I
had that installed when I decided to have a quick hack at it.  I did a
'make' and a 'make install', but it's possible I picked up an old
module??

My modulepath is commented out, so it's not likely.

The only module I use is FvwmPager, and that's from $HOME/.fvwm2rc.  I
just 'exec fvwm2' from my .xinitrc.

It's probably a Heisenbug.  Best to let it go...

No.

I'm kinda scratching my head over it.  Has anyone spent any time
configuring fvwm to allow single-click deiconification?  I set ClickTime
to 75 for this.

I find that I often end up moving an icon rather than opening it. 
Stretching the move threshold distance like this seems to help.

The other problem, of course, is that with shaped icons it's easy to
click on a "hole" in the image.  I believe it'd be expensive to put a
transparent window around the icon boundary to avoid this.

Cheers,
Andrew.

fvwm doesn't work very well with double clicks, so I try to avoid them at all.
(The problem is that I need a hight ClickTime to get the double clicks right,
but then executing functions with a double click action take too long to execute).
Unfortunately I don't see a way around that.

Well, as a last resort you can override the icon with your own.
Other window managers draw a background behind each icon. We have this as
an enhancement request already, but didn't find the time to do anything.
I could imagine this:

  Style * IconBackground <colour>

and

  Style * IconBackground pixmap foo.xpm

as the syntax.

The first would simply create a 3d background in the given colour (with
the setting from the DefaultBackground command as the default). We'll
get request for gradient backgrounds soon if we start this, so putting
this stuff in the library should be done first.

The keys are called KP_0 to KP_9 in X11. These are the names that are used
in fvwm too.

  Key KP_7 a n GotoPage 0 0

Should do (if I understood 'I will be taken to' correctly). Note that the
'KP' has to be upper-case.

Don't take the 2.1.x releases too serious. The 'menu position' feature
was still under development back then. What you describe is not what I had
intended. If you leave out the context rectangle the default is the mouse
position. What you experience now is the correct behaviour.

Hi,

When I use my middle mouse button to drag a window within the Pager, the wi=
ndow is not being dragged and I simply change viewports.  I believe that th=
ere must be some configurable option that I am missing.  The middle button =
works in an Xterm when I use it for the paste operation.

I am using the same .fvwmrc that I used for a Solaris box and it works fine=
.  The problem only occurs on my Linux box.  Any comments or solutions?

Thanks,

Kim

Is this still a problem with the current code? If yes, can you send
me your FvwmPager config, please?

The syntax has changed substantially since the 2.1.x betas. To get the
desired effect use

  *FvwmTaskBarStartMenu StartMenu root 0p o100-25p

The 'o100' means that the lower edge of the screen and the menu will
overlap before the -25p are applied. The syntax change was necessary
to make the position hint more versatile.

No, you aren't missing anything. There is no such option.

I guess you have picked up one of the versions that had this bug on
your Linux box. With fvwm2.2 and up this is no problem. Only some
of the 2.1.x betas had this. Please make sure you are really using
the correct FvwmPager. Perhaps your path points to an old one.

Hi everybody,
In FVWM2, is there any way to restrict the size of all windows produced =
by
any application to a certain size and position? You'll tell me "use a
geometry setting." Well, certainly geometry works but only for the =
initial window.
What about all the other windows further produced by an application? My =
card
supports only 640x480 and if I, for example, use Netscape in Linux ( =
with
any window manager), the initial window obeys to the geometry I specify, =
but
the rest are somtimes so huge that they don't fit in my house:-) Same =
about
Word Perfect. Same about other stuff. In twm there is an option called
MaxWIndowSize, but what about FVWM? I've also tried KDE and I had the =
same
problem. It's especially annoying when I can't see "O.K" "Cancel" =
buttons at
the bottom of a window because it's too huge or because the task bar =
covers
that portion. You'll tell me "Use autohide", but I don't want to use
autohide and I don't want to use virtual screens. I just want my windows =
to
fit in one screen above the task bar.

Until it is fixed, you might wish to bind a key to Maximize so that
you can easily make windows smaller to fit the screen.

Despite its name, Maximize can make windows smaller, too: if they're
larger than the size specified in the Maximize command.

Um, I haven't actually tried this with fvwm, but I'd be surprised if
it didn't work.

Perhaps at the moment, but in the past few weeks there have been a lot
of evil bugs in there.

It *is* in the man page. Perhaps you are reading an old one?

If you don't mind losing the ability to have shaped windows you could
compile fvwm with shapes disabled (./configure --disable-shape) to get
rid of the holes in pixmap-icons.

Don't forget that since fvwm can now use non-default visuals that you
can't simply combine a client supplied icon pixmap with fvwm's graphics.
Fvwm will be using whatever visual the use asked for and the client
pixmap will use the default visual.

To draw anything with client supplied icon pixmaps you would have to
create a window with the fvwm visuals that fvwm could draw into and then
create a window with the default visuals that is a child of the previous
window to copy the icon pixmap into (and shape).

Tim.

(I sent this a couple of days ago, but it hasn't popped up on the list
yet, so I'm resending it.)


Hi,

  I don't know if this is a fvwm 2.2 issue or a Netscape issue, but I've
only noticed this problem with Netscape windows.  (Bear with me, I think
it's an original report...)

  I run Netscape (actually, just Navigator and Messenger) at 
1018x688+0+56, with "BorderWidth 3, HandleWidth 3", essentially expanding
it to fill the whole screen, minus the 56 pixel row at the top of the
screen.  (Actually, to get this geometry, I just did a "Maximize 100 100",
and then resized the top down by 56 pixels.)  From here on out, when I
mention Netscape windows, I'm referring to just Navigator and Messenger
windows, since both of these exhibit the problem.  (Others, like Composer,
might too, but I don't run them.)

  The problem:  sometimes, if I try to move my mouse pointer into another
page, I get "blocked" on the edges by the Netscape window.  I just can't
"push" past the border of the window.  It's not always the same edge -- it
can be the left, right, or bottom edge (never the top edge, since this
only occurs for Netscape borders against the edge of the current page).
When this happens, I see the arrow-pointing-to-the-edge icon, the one you
get for resizing edges, since the mouse pointer is "stuck" over Netscape's
border.  This happens maybe once or twice a day, and I'm on the computer a
lot.  (Or so says my fiancee :-)

  I run several other programs full-screen in a similar fashion, e.g.
xterm, xmaple, xemacs, etc. but I haven't seen anything exhibit this
behavior other than Netscape.  I've found that it's usually pretty easy to
get around, either by using Ctrl-Arrow keys to switch pages, or to move
the mouse off of some other edge of the page, return back to the original
page, and attempt to move the mouse to the desired page again, which seems
to always cause it to work again.  However, it is pretty annoying.

  Is this an fvwm issue, or a Netscape issue?  I'll post what I think may
be relevent config info below.  As always, please contact me if you need 
more info.

Thanks,
-jason

You must have picked up something strange because version 2.2 doesn't
have this error message in it.  Version 2.3.0 was prone to pausing,
version 2.3.1 onwards is less likely to pause (you have to do `fvwm -cmd
FvwmButtons' to get a pause).

Not any more.  Version 2.3.1 onwards only waits for modules started from
the command line and ignores modules started from inside rc files. If
this isn't the case let me know because I think I fixed it.

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm running xdm on my machine with FVWM.  When I exit FVWM (using the 'Quit'
command) my screen locks up and I get a lot of garbage on the screen.  A few
seconds later xdm starts up again.

Is there anyway to avoid this?  I guess I'm wondering if there is another
command that would provide a smoother transition.

Also, anyone know when the FVWM 2.2 package will be available for Debian?

Thanks,

Matt

No, there is no such book, only the man pages which I would hardly call
user-friendly. Every module has its own man page.

Do you mean when you switch from window A to window B you lose some
colours and when you move back to A you don't get them back? If it's
this I have no idea. Which are the applications involved. But I think
it's more likely you are running applications with a private colour
map. The one example I can think of is netscape. When started with the
'-install' option it will use a private colour map. When the cursor
enters the netscape window the colours on the desktop will screw up.
This is no bug but what private colour maps are supposed to look like.
It's simply a last resort for desktops with too few available colours.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

That's not your screen locking up; that the X server restarting.

When you login, you do all kinds of things to the server; load database
info, etc.  The best/only way to get a "clean" X server for the next guy
who logs in, is to restart the server.

Well, there's no way to avoid the X server restart; that's part of the
architecture of xdm.

I suppose it depends a lot on the particular X server, what happens to
your video display during the time the server is restarting.  Some might
try harder to leave the screen looking "nice" during the restart... I
suppose for some video cards that might not even be possible.

In any case, this isn't an fvwm question :).  You'd see the same
behavior with any other window manager.

	Reading back over the entire thread, it looks as though the key
condition is that *any* border of the offending Motif window is at the
edge of the viewport where you want to cross to another page. It
definitely will occur at the top edge as well, and that's the only place
I remembered seeing it happen.

In the past I have described this to other fvwm2 users and they 
have always thought I was crazy.  I have never been able to 
reproduce it on demand, and so far only with Netscape ( I don't 
think I use any other motif apps ).  

I see the same thing on Linux with XFree86 and on Solaris 
with openwin.  It will only happen if netscape is "busy" at 
the time, and only when I try to automaticaly cross a border 
that has the edge of Netscape jammed against it.  

For the past year or so I have just changed the way I use 
netscape - I use it in the bottom left screen of a single 3x3 
desktop and make the window about 95% fullscreen so only the 
left edge touches the screen edge.  I don't have anything to 
cross there, so it hides the problem.

	First...please see if Outlook Express has an option to send just plain
ASCII text instead of html. It's considered rude to send inline html to
mailing lists, where many of the recipients (often by choice) use e-mail
clients that don't like html. 

	Now...on to your question. startx is just a shell script that invokes
xinit. It doesn't put its output anyplace special, which means that it
will just get written to the console from which you invoked it.

	A common practice is to modify startx to suit your own preferences. I
do this to have the stdout/stderr output redirected to /dev/console to
that I can view the output with xconsole or some such tool while X is
running. To do this, look for a line - probably the last line in startx
- that looks something like this:

	xinit $clientargs -- $serverargs

and modify it to look like this:

	xinit $clientargs -- $serverargs >/dev/console 2>&1

I have fixed this bug. If you don't want to use the development code
you can set the side colour as a menu style:

  MenuStyle StartMenu SideColor #808080

I've had similar things for the last year or so. For me it occurs when I use
the Scroll command to switch pages. I'll make it to my new page, and then get
immediately snapped back to the one with netscape on it. As I recall, it only
happens when netscape is busy.

Hi all,

I use fvwm 2.2 with linux-2.2.x and I have experiment some well
known bugs (the TaskBar startmenu always pressed bug, the many open
windows TaskBar bug, the FvwmCommandS kernel 2.2.x bug, the WindowShade
on maximized window bug).

I have tried a devel-snap and all this bugs seems to be fixed !
However, I prefer to use a stable version ... even if I use now
the FvwmCommandS of the devel-snap (the devel-snap TaskBar does not
work with 2.2).

So my question: Is there any plan for a 2.2.1 version which will be
a stabilized version of 2.2 (no more feature but fix for easy fixed
bug) ? This will be great !

Many Thanks for all the fvwm devellopers !
Olivier

2.2.1 is close to the announcement, but it only addresses the most
critical bugs. The FvwmCommandS bug should be fixed, but not the
TaskBar bugs.

(Steve, how far are you with the 2.2.1 announcement?)

I don't like changing system scripts like startx, since it makes package
managers (Debian, RPM, etc.) nervous.

Also, I switch between XDM (which wants ~/.xsession) and vanilla startx
(which wants ~/.xinitrc) fairly regularly.

What I do is this:

  * In ~/.xinitrc:

      . $HOME/.xrc

  * In ~/.xsession:

      . $HOME/.xrc

  * In ~/.xrc:

      # This is the X startup script...
      #

      exec >$HOME/.Xerrorlog 2>&1

      # Do some stuff!

      exec fvwm2

Note I use bash; if you don't use a Bourne-ish shell (then switch!  No
no no that's not it... :) you may need to rewrite some or all of the
above.  I don't really know how to do it in csh.

The trick in ~/.xrc is the exec; if you don't give a filename arg to
exec, it modifies the stdout/stderr of the current process (the shell).
Thus you can redirect all subsequent output to wherever you like (here I
use a file).  See the man page for sh (or bash or whatever).

Lastly I exec the window manager so when it exits, my X session exits.

HTH!

Wow, I didn't know you can do it this complicated ;-)
I simply use an alias:

  alias x="startx $* > ~/.X.err 2>&1"

It's less keystrokes to restart X too.

Hi,

I've got a solaris station that people are using from their PC with Excee=
d.
When all the users on their PC use CDE as their WM, everything is fine.
But now I've got a set of users that want to use fvwm instead.
So, I've installed it but we cannot run it becasue CDE is running as well=
=2E

Question: Is it possible and how to have both WM manager running for mult=
iple
users using Excced on their PC?

Thanks in advance.

Francois Arcasedda.

 When I set up Exceed, I didn't set it up to use CDE, even though I had it
available. I just set Exceed up in passive mode, then wrote an xstart file
to launch the window manager itself, with an appropriate -display setting.
(Well, I wrote a shell script wrapper to set some environment variables
first.) The menus were all generated from the window manager, so it all
worked pretty well. The users essentially get a unix "desktop in a window"
on thier NT stations. This concept was familar to them, having used WinDD
and WTS on thier old unix stations before.

 One caveate is that you lose access to /dev/console. We had some old
scripts that tried to write to there and had to be re-written.

I'm letting you know...

it doesn't appear to be "fixed".

The only modules I invoke are FvwmBanner and FvwmAnimate.

If I invoke FvwmAnimate from a file read by my .fvwm2rc, as

Module FvwmAnimate

the banner and a recapture happen after about 60 seconds.

This is with 2.3.2 from a day or 2 ago.

Can't work with XDM.  And XDM gives even _less_ keystrokes to restart X :)

Okay, but as a wm developer using xdm is a bit uncomfortable :)

Hi,

I am struggling a little trying to compile the latest version  of fvwm,
I was wondering if anyone can shed some light on my problem.
All seems to go well until the linking stage....here is an output with
all debug options turned on....

What is "milli.a" and why are you trying to link with it?  I've never
heard of that before... maybe some HP-UX system library?

Anyway, you'll have to give more details on your system, such as what
compiler you're using, any special config flags you specified, _what_
you're trying to link (fvwm2?  Some module?); please provide the actual
link command that gets executed by make, not just the errors that the
command generates... without the command the errors are hard to interpret.

I am trying to compile fvwm2.2 ... I'll worry about the modules whenever
I have this brute out the way....

after run the make command this is what it returns.... (this time
without the -v (verbose) option on ld....to save space

As can bee seen I am using gcc...version 2.7.0 if that helps...
any clearer?

Where do my minimized windows go? With fvwm, they would iconize and end up
in the corner of the screen. Since I've switched to fvwm2, they just
disappear and the only way to summon them back is to use the
right-button-on-desktop window menu.

Can someone tell me how to change this behavior so that my minimized
windows
become iconized?

Thanks,
--Brian

Oh poo! I thought it was all fixed. Shows how much testing I do.

I've committed a fix, it's in CVS now and in the snapshot
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-19990518.tar.gz
but won't appear in a release until 2.3.4

What happens now is that the variable DoingCommandLine is set before
every command line arg is run and both Read and ReadPipe unset it.  Only
modules that are started when DoingCommandLine is set are waited for. 
Does this sound OK?

Cheers,
Tim.

I  didn't use the  snapshots, but the  latest CVS fixes the problem of
delays with modules being started outside the InitFunction.

Look for "Style * NoIcon" somewhere in your configuration.  Remove
the "NoIcon" part.

There are differences between fvwm and fvwm2 as to how the iconbox(es)
are  defined.  Search the fvwm2   man page for "iconbox",  "icongrid",
"iconfill".

I am sorry if this is a repeat but I just subscribed to this list.

I have installed the new RedHat 6.0 and being an avid supporter of fvwm I
would like to use it under the new operating system. I previously used it
under RH5.2 without any problems. However under 6.0 I can only start fvwm
using startx and cannot start fvwm from xdm screen. Everytime I start from
xdm it seems to want to force me to use a gnome compliant window manager
and ...

Any suggestions.

Hi,

I am currently using fvwm 1.24r.  I am looking into fvwm 2.  Could
any of you refer me to web pages where I could find different
screenshot and configuration file to start fiddling with fvwm2.  

Thanks

Dominic.

Fine. However, I have several accounts now that I need to bring up xterms

   "I" AddToMenu Peeps "$0" Popup $0____ Item 80 -100-4p
+  "I" DestroyMenu $0____
+  "I" AddTomenu $0____ "localhost"  \
       exec XTerm -r `uname -n` $0 "$0 login `uname -n`" "$0"
+  "I" AddTomenu $0____ ""           \
       Nop
+  "I" AddTomenu $0____ "wsc097"     \
       exec XTerm -r wsc097 $0 "$0 login wsc097" "$0"
+  "I" AddTomenu $0____ "wsc098"     \
       exec XTerm -r wsc098 $0 "$0 login wsc098" "$0"


  .. etc. (I've split the lines to fit them into the e-mail).

  This does work, but I don't get any separator! Now, I *can* make the ""
into "-", and the entry duly appears, but of course then I just see '-' as
its label!

  Why does the 'AddTomenu blah "" Nop' not work in this instance?

Do you know a smart system console which is not visible and just opens
itself when a message arrives. On Solaris, I used to have contool which
coupled with fvwm is fine. I would like such a console with Linux and
HPUX also.

Can you try this instead:

  +  "I" AddTomenu $0____ \"\" Nop
                          ^^^^

I'm not prepared to call these bug reports just yet (well, the
FvwmConsole thing is a feature request); most likely I'm missing
something in the man page or the FAQ (both of which I've read).
Here's the issues I've run into that I can't find a fix for.  To head
off one expected answer, yes I did eliminate the old MODULEPATH and
have verified (via truss) that the 2.2 modules are the ones being
called for.  If it matters, I'm running on Solaris 2.5.1 and built
fvwm2 with the openwin libraries.  I also included xpm, readline and
rplay support.  No compilation errors occurred.

1: I have a function that tries to warp to a given window if it
exists, if it doesn't it execs the desired program/runs the desired
module and warps to that.  Here's the definition:

AddToFunc run-then-warp "I" $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
+ "I" Wait $0
+ "I" Next ($0 CirculateHit) myfocus 50 50 Iconify -1

AddToFunc warp-or-run "I" Next ($0 CirculateHit) myfocus 50 50 Iconify -1
+ "I" Next ($0) myfocus 50 50 Iconify -1
+ "I" None ($0 CirculateHit) run-then-warp $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

Then I have in a menu definition:

+ "&FvwmConsole" warp-or-run FvwmConsole Module FvwmConsole

But when I try to do this I get the following error:

xterm:  bad command line option "$3"
[xterm usage message deleted]

Unlike 2.0.46, which didn't pass additional function args if they
didn't exist, 2.2 seems to put in the $# stuff.  Is this a bug or am I 
just missing something?

2: FlipFocus doesn't work the way I expect.  I have the following:

AddToFunc myfocus "I" $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
+ "I" WarpToWindow $0 $1
+ "I" Focus

AddToFunc togglewindow "I" FlipFocus
+ "I" Prev (!iconic CurrentPage) myfocus 0 0 Nop

And bind togglewindow to Alt-TAB.  Under 2.0.46 that caused Alt-TAB to
switch between only the top two windows.  Under 2.2 it switches
amongst all the windows on the current page.  I'm clearly missing
something but I've tried replacing the Prev with Current and Next and
Adding a Current to the first line.  All to no avail.  How to get the
old behavior (other than downgrading :-)?

3: My FvwmForms no longer work.  Near as I can tell my configs conform 
to the man pages, but when I try to start it I get the following:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  31
  Current serial number in output stream:  41

4: (feature request, I'll try to come up with a patch later today) My
home directory is in AFS space which means that I can't have FIFOs etc
in there.  For FvwmCommand, I can specify the -f option to provide for
an alternate path for the FIFO.  I need to be able to do the same for
FvwmConsole, which is hardwired to $HOME.  I realize I can try
wrapping FvwmConsole with a shell script that sets HOME and execs
FvwmConsole, but that seems suboptimal.  Unless there's a way to set
an envar in .fvwm2rc that I've missed.

Thanks for any help,

Actually in the man page should have
     SetEnv varname stringvalue
          Set an environment variable to a new value, similar  to
          shell's export or setenv command.  The variable and its
          value are inherited by processes  started  directly  by
          fvwm2.   This  can  be especially useful in conjunction
          with the FvwmM4 module; e.g.   "SetEnv  height  HEIGHT"
          will  make  the  FvwmM4-set variable "HEIGHT" usable by
          processes started by fvwm2 as the environment  variable
          "$height".   If  stringvalue  includes  whitespace, you
          should enclose it in quotes.

not sure if this will do what you want for FvwmConsole but it will let
you set an environment variable.

Damn.  That's what I get for printing out the manual rather than
reading it online and being able to C-s it.  This solved two of my
problems.  I defined the following:

AddToFunc doFvwmConsole "I" SetEnv {HOME} /tmp/.dsg
+ "I" FvwmConsole
+ "I" SetEnv {HOME} HOME

(You can see I use FvwmM4 with {} specified for quote chars) Which
does the right thing with respect to running FvwmConsole and as a side
effect by changing my warp-or-run calls from 

"warp-or-run FvwmConsole Module FvwmConsole" to

"warp-or-run FvwmConsole doFvwmConsole

I no longer have the problem with $3 being passed to xterm as an
argument.  I still think that might be a problem for other things
though I haven't run into them yet.

On another note, now that I've got FvwmConsole working I've been able
to debug a bit.  It seems that my FvwmForms are working after all.  It
was my trying to get at it via calls to warp-or-run.  For now I've
just made explict calls to FvwmForm.  I'm guessing it's some sort of
quoting problem.

Thanks!

I apologize for my reply to Brad being duplicated.  His message had a
Reply-To field in it that I didn't notice.  For some reason pgnus'
wide-reply function decided to send both to that *and* to the default
list address I have set up for the group.  I've never seen that happen
before.  I don't have broken-reply-to set for the group since it's
administered properly.  Perhaps I should do that just in case :-)

So I've now got it working pretty much as I want.  I've figured out
flipfocus by searching for it in the man page beyond its own
definition.  The example of it being used with windowlist led me to
redefine togglewindow as

AddToFunc togglewindow "I" Prev (!iconic CurrentPage) FlipFocus
+ "I" Current (!iconic CurrentPage) Raise

and I now have the behavior I want.

That leaves the problem with empty arguments being passed (maybe
that's a bug?) and one other minor nit I noticed when I did a restart
via FvwmCommand:

[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2
' failed!!!! (restarting 'fvwm2' instead)

Somewhere along the line I thought I'd seen that one fixed, but I
guess not.

The only thing still bugging me is why warp-or-run can't seem to
properly run FvwmForm.

My problem with warp-or-run et al is related to the empty function
arguments.  If FvwmForm gets called as

FvwmForm MyQuitVerify $3 $4 etc etc

it dies on startup.

Thanks,

Doesn't contool compile on these other platforms?

I don't know of anything better.

No amount of quoting helps.  Here's a trace having put some Echo's
into the functions:

In FvwmConsole I try 

warp-or-run MyQuitVerify FvwmForm MyQuitVerify or
warp-or-run MyQuitVerify "FvwmForm MyQuitVerify" or
warp-or-run MyQuitVerify 'FvwmForm MyQuitVerify'

All three result in

[FVWM][Echo]:  Next (MyQuitVerify CirculateHit) myfocus 50 50 Iconify -1
[FVWM][Echo]:  None (MyQuitVerify CirculateHit) run-then-warp MyQuitVerify FvwmForm MyQuitVerify $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
[FVWM][Echo]:  run-then-warp MyQuitVerify FvwmForm MyQuitVerify $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8
[FVWM][Echo]:  Wait MyQuitVerify
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  31
  Current serial number in output stream:  41
        
with the only difference being whether $2 or $3 shows up as the first
$ arg in the call to run-then-warp.  In 2.0.46, the extraneous $ args
were evaluated to nothing and didn't show up in such a trace (and the
function worked).

I hope this is a simple question, but my efforts to answer it have
been fruitless so far.

I just got a second monitor on my Sun.  I understand that there is a
separate fvwm managing each monitor.  No problem.  However, what I
want to do is run a slightly different .fvwmrc in each of these
processes, and I can't figure out how to do it.

A simple if-then-else construct in the config file would solve my
problems.  I could just key off the $DISPLAY environment variable.
Alternatively, if I could find a way to use $DISPLAY as part of the
filename in a Read command (like "Read .fvwmrc$DISPLAY" or something),
that would work, too.  But, no luck.

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.

Okay, perhaps this is too obvious, but I believe that xdm reads .xsession
whereas startx reads .xinitrc. If you don't have a .xsession, try copying
your .xinitrc and see if that helps. If you do, sorry for wasting your time.
(I haven't used RedHat 6.0 myself.)

Its not the quoting that I was trying to convey.
I didn't see in your problem report where you used the word
"Module".  You can't just issue the command:

FvwmForm MyQuitVerify

you have to use the command

Module FvwmForm MyQuitVerify

If I'm being dumb, and I missed it, let us know.  Eventually one of us
WILL get to the bottom of this.

In general, to get conditional processing in your config file,
you would use the FvwmCPP or FvwmM4 modules.  The PipeRead command
may help, or fvwm2 can be invoked with command line args, like:

fvwm2 -f .fvwmrc$DISPLAY

Why? 'Module' shouldn't be necessary if there isn't some builtin or
complex function with the same name.

The window manager used with gnome in Redhat 6.0 is changeable in the Gnome
Control Centre under the descriptive name "window managers".

simply add fvwm, test it works with try and then click ok. make sure you save
settings before you log out.

on this subject can the developers give some idea when fvwm will be compatible
with both KDE and Gnome. Having looked at Enlightenment I'm quite impressed.
sure it's all just eye candy and a big resource hog but its configuration
program is amazing.
I think it should be relatively easy to change this program's parsing to
configure Fvwm. When I've got time I'll have a look at it, but since I'm very
busy don't rely on me.

My mistake.  I THOUGHT is was necessary in order to get the arguments
to the module set up right, but a little test shows thats not true.

I guess I/we are going to have to dig a little deeper...

The problem is almost certainly the empty arguments being passed to
the exec of the FvwmForm module.  I trussed my fvwm2 with the follow
option and I see at the execve line:

4754:   fork()          (returning as child ...)        = 2405
4754:   close(23)                                       = 0
4754:   close(24)                                       = 0
4754:   execve("/blackbird/local/openwin/libexec/fvwm/2.2/FvwmForm", 0xEFFF8AB8, 0xEFFFF398)  argc = 14

argc should certainly not be 14.  I'm passing FvwmForm one argument,
the name of the form.  fvwm2 passes it an addition 6 if I remember
correctly.  If I call FvwmForm MyXcmd without the wrapper function
argc shows up as 7 as expected.  Since I don't want to waste bandwidth
on the list, if anyone wants the truss outputs, I'll be happy to email
them.  Hmm.  Better yet, I've put them on my web page:

I'm convinced.  I see the problem as far back as 2.1.4.  (Thats as far
back as I can go at the moment.)  This simple test demonstrates the
problem:

AddToFunc showit "I" Echo "I got: " $0 $1 $2 $3
showit test

Which produces:

[FVWM][Echo]:  "I got: " test $1 $2 $3

I think we both are missing something, the actual result of this
test in older fvwm2 releases.  I think it might have been:

[FVWM][Echo]:  "I got: " test

but right now I can't prove that.

I think it would be reasonable for missing arguments to a function
to resolve to nothing rather than the symbolic notation for the
argument.

If you don't specify $1 $2 $3 then they should eval to null rather
than to themselves, in the function call.  That allows (and did allow
in 2.0.46) a function to be written that could take an arbitrary (well 
up to 9) number of arguments.  Because that's not happening, my call
to FvwmForm is being exec'd with additional arguments that are
apparently confusing either FvwmForm itself or some X library function 
it is calling.  Unfortunately truss doesn't work at that high a level
and trying to attach to fvwm with gdb screws up my windowing something 
awful :-)  Hmmm.  Maybe if I run fvwm in an Xnest server and attach to
that.  Hmmm.  I won't have time to do it until next week, but if
nothing else comes up I'll give it a shot then.

I don't think thats necessary, FvwmForm checks is arg count.  If there
are too many args, its  not going to run correctly.   In the 2.2  time
frame,  if the arg  count  isn't 7 (including  the 6  from fvwm2), its
going to ignore the  form name (MyQuitVerify),  leading to creating  a
bad window.

My guess is, we are going to fix this by making the extra args go away
like they apparently did in the past.

I would have expected to see 
[FVWM][Echo]:  "I got: " test

since $1 $2 and $3 are all empty strings

The problem is in functions.c:expand 

the problem is that I ddin't acount for quite enough cases the last
time I patcehd this function.  What needs to be done is to distinguish
between creating a function and actually expanding args when it is being
executed.  This patch works for me in all places where I use $args could
someone else apply it and commit it if it works for them too.

I am trying to install fvwm-2.2.1 on my Redhat 5.1 linux box, I've
downloaded the tar.gz file, unzipped it and everything, waded through he
INSTALL and INSTALL.fvwm,

I have run ./configure, and it goes, and goes, and then comes up with
Error: Can't run test program while cross compiling
or something similar.  I can't find any mention of this and without the
needed makefile, can't finish the install

Can anyone help ??

The next version of fvwm (2.4) will definitely have GNOME support.  It's
actually already in there, if you want to try one of the development
snapshots (see the web page for links and info).

So far, while people have expressed an interest in wanting KDE support,
no one has signed up to do it (one of the GNOME folks actually did the
whole first cut at GNOME support).

As for configuration, 2.4 will also see some more self-configuration
menus using FvwmForm, similar to what was done for FvwmAnimate in 2.2.
In particular if you start fvwm2 "from scratch" with no ~/.fvwm2rc you
should have a much nicer experience than before.

There are other things that should make configuration simpler: modules
will honor some "global settings" like background color, foreground
color, etc. so that getting a consistent "theme" will be easier.

It won't cover everything, obviously, but we're thinking about these
issues.

Probably, but not without the exact error message, and a few of the
lines leading up to the message.

Okay, here we go. fvwm-2.2.1.tar.gz downloaded and unzipped, wasn't sure
where
to put it (is this important ??) so put it in /usr/X11R6 . Then ran
./configure from /usr/X11R6/fvwm-2.2.1/ . This gave many lines of checks
(almost all - yes) then these lines at the end

<quote>
checking for strchr... yes
checking for sysconf... yes
checking for uname... yes
checking for div... yes
checking for sigaction... yes
checking for siginterrupt... yes
checking for sig_atomic_t... yes
checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can
not
run test program while cross compiling
</quote>

I presume this error stops configure from generating the makefile needed
for
make install.

PS When I say does this matter above, I sound awfully like some girl who
says
' is it important to put oil in the engine then ?? !!  (sorry for being
very
un PC !)

Many thanks to Dan for putting me on the right path to solve my
problem.  I thought I'd share what I ended up doing in case someone
else might benefit from it.

The key problem is that I need to do different things based on the
value of the DISPLAY environment variable.  Dan suggested FvwmM4 and
FvwmCpp.  Either of these would have worked great, if only FVWM passed
the value of DISPLAY down to them.  Unfortunately, it doesn't.
(Consider this a request for feature, if you wish :-)

Dan also mentioned PipeRead, which turned out to be the best thing.  I
just wrote a shell script that spits different things to standard
output based on the value of DISPLAY.  Here it is, in case anyone's
interested:


  #!/bin/sh

  if [ "$DISPLAY" = ":0.1" ] 
  then
    cat <<'EOT'
  AddToFunc InitFunction    "I"  Exec exec xconsole -geometry 800x100-1+0 -iconic &
  +                         "I"  Exec exec xterm -geometry 100x50+71-1 -T $HOSTNAME -n $HOSTNAME &
  +                         "I"  Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x50-1-1 -T $HOSTNAME -n $HOSTNAME &
  #+                         "I"  Exec exec netscape45 -install -geometry 1072x872+70+900 &
  EOT
  fi

  ###################### button-bar ################################

  cat <<'EOT'
  # Colors
  *FvwmButtonsFore Black
  *FvwmButtonsBack #908090

  # Font
  *FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

  # Geometry - really likes to pick its own size, but giving a position is OK

  EOT

  if [ $DISPLAY = ':0.1' ]
  then
    echo "*FvwmButtonsGeometry +0-1\n\n"
  elif [ $DISPLAY = ':0.0' ]
  then
    echo "*FvwmButtonsGeometry -1-1\n\n"
  fi

  cat <<'EOT'
  # Layout: specify rows or columns, not both
  *FvwmButtonsColumns 1

  # Define the buttons to use.....

  *FvwmButtons(Icon xterm.xpm, Action 'Exec xterm -T $HOSTNAME -n $HOSTNAME')

  EOT

  if [ $DISPLAY = ':0.1' ]
  then
    cat <<'EOT'
  *FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld,NoRespawn) perfmeter1 `Exec exec $OPENWINHOME/bin/perfmeter -t load -g -S -V -Wn -s 2 -name perfmeter1 -bg '#908090'`)
  *FvwmButtons(Swallow(UseOld,NoRespawn) xbiff `Exec exec $OPENWINHOME/bin/xbiff -bg '#908090'`)
  *FvwmButtons(Icon LetterEnvelope.xpm, Action 'Exec xterm -geometry 80x50 -T mutt -n mutt -e mutt')
  EOT
  fi

  cat <<'EOT'
  *FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "FvwmPager" Module FvwmPager 0 0
  EOT

What this does is, on my main monitor (:0.1), fvwm starts up two
xterms.  The button bar is in the lower left corner and has five
buttons: xterm, xperfmon, xbiff, mutt, and pager.  On the auxiliary
monitor (:0.0), the button bar is in the lower right corner and has
only two buttons: xterm and pager.

That's about it.  Thanks again, Dan, for the help.

I don't use M4 or CPP, but I think this would work:

fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp -DDISPLAY=$DISPLAY .fvwm2rc"

Maybe we need some more man page examples.

Yep, PipeRead is pretty cool.

It isn't important where you put it, as when you do the "make install" step
all files are put in their correct locations. If you don't want to keep the
source around (I don't), /tmp would be a sensible place to unpack it, otherwise
/usr/src is the usual place to put sources.

Yes. The error means that the ./configure script couldn't execute a small
test program that it compiled (and assumed that it meant the compiler was
compiling for a different architecture). The ./configure script should have
created a config.log file with more information about what went wrong. If
you post it (or the relevant portions), I/we may be able to provide more
help.

This means your compiler is installed incorrectly somehow.  I've seen it
many times.

Thanks for providing those bits of the configure output, but the output
you want is further up, nearer the start, where fvwm looks for the C and
C++ compilers (the latter is much further down than the former).

Go back up and look, and you'll see it says "looking for C
compiler... ok" then it'll say "Checking if it's a cross
compiler... yes".  That "yes" is wrong, it should be a "no".

What this means is that configure found the compiler and it seems to run
OK, _BUT_ when it tried to link and execute a small program, the program
didn't run.  Thus, configure assumes it's cross-compiling.

Go into the config.log file and find the part where it's testing the C
compiler or C++ compiler (whichever one it says is a cross-compiler) and
find out what error it got when trying to run the program.  If you don't
understand the error, post it here so we can see it.

Sorry about the extreme length but can't really understand it. (never did like C,
much prefer VB !)

For info sake this was done on a linux box with Redhat 5.2 (all packages installed)
and running bash.

Hope you can help

Hi,

  I'm running 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 (19990521), and both exhibit the following
behavior (not seen in 2.2.x).  I have some programs that I stick at the
top of the screen, with the property 'Sticky'.  Three of them
(wmWeather, xmailbox, and pload) hang a little off the top of the screen
(i.e., if I 'Move' them, the geometry display shows that their
Y-coordinate is a small negative number).  Since they're shaped images, I
can't tell that they're hanging off the top, since the part that is
hanging off is transparent.

  Anyway, when I do a 'Restart', I lose all of these programs.  To
be sure, they're still running, but FvwmPager shows that they seem to be
stuck on the page below the current page, no matter which page I move to.

  I experimented by moving programs that weren't lost on previous
'Restart's until they had negative Y-coordinates, 'Restart'ed, and sure
enough they disappeared to the page below.

  I've found that if I modify .fvwm2rc to make these programs non-Sticky
(and appear in the WindowList), and then 'Restart', they are still Sticky
and do not appear in the WindowList.  The only way to get them back is to
kill off the programs by hand and relaunch them, or kill X and log back
in.  Sometimes I can use the FvwmWinList module to recover the missing
windows, but it does not work for all programs that are lost.  My current
workaround is to just not 'Restart' fvwm2.  :-)

Thanks for listening,
-jason

Yep, right here, just as I said: configure decides that GCC is a
cross-compiler.  This is quite obviously The Wrong Thing To Do.

Hmm.  It doesn't, though, seem to give any error messages which might
help us understand the problem :(

We'll just have do it ourselves.  Go to about line 1360 in your
configure script, and change the if-statement from this:

  ac_cv_prog_cc_works=yes
  # If we can't run a trivial program, we are probably using a cross compiler.
> if (./conftest; exit) 2>/dev/null; then
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=no
  else
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=yes
  fi

To this:

  ac_cv_prog_cc_works=yes
  # If we can't run a trivial program, we are probably using a cross compiler.
> if (./conftest; exit); then
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=no
  else
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=yes
  fi

The ">" shouldn't really go in the code, of course.  E.g., remove the
2>/dev/null from the if-statement.

Now delete config.cache and re-run the configure.  It should then show
some kind of error message when it checks to see if the compiler is a
cross-compiler.  Send that error message.

Ah.  Okay... :)

Okay, it looks like what has happened is that your compiler has got
misconfigured somehow to compile for libc.so.5 instead of libc.so.6. I don't
know why, i assume Red Hat don't ship it like that. If noone else comes up
with a smart fix for this, all I can suggest is the brute-force method of
reinstalling gcc from CD (or from an official RPM, if you don't have the Red
Hat CD).

Gulp.  Your compiler/shared libraries are seriously whacked.  I suggest
you reinstall at least the compiler from scratch.

HTH.

PS. Oh, I just saw your post about reinstalling Linux--OK, that's
    another way to go :)

Note it's all the some make command; I was just wondering how far it'd
gotten.

So, essentially, you aren't able to get any fvwm programs to link?  Try
running "make -k" and see if _anything_ links (redirect the output to a
log so you can look at it later).

What is "-g3" for?  Did you add that?

Hmm... "hp821"?  I hate it when people get fancy on installs and
override the default names :).  What version of HP-UX are you using?  I
wonder if the GCC you have there was compiled for a different version of
HP-UX?  That could definitely be a problem.

Have you ever been able to compile and link other apps with this
compiler?  Other X apps?

Well, my only other suggestion is to "man shl_load", etc. and see if you
can figure out from the man page (if there is one) what library these
symbols are supposed to be defined in.  If you find out, you can add it
to the link line.

Another way to go is to use nm on all the libs in /lib or /usr/lib and
find the one that defines those functions (see the man page for nm for
details).

I've noticed that when I run X with fvwm, my screen goes blank after a
period of inactivity.  Since I'm using fvwm with a touch screen and I
don't want to accidentally touch a button when I'm waking up the video,
I'd like to disable the screen saver.  I'm not sure if it's fvwm that is
causing this blanking to happen or not.  If anybody knows how to disable
the screen blanking, please let me know.

Thanks...

                   Dave

PS - I'm using Fvwm Ver 1.24r under Linux and Lynx.

It's not.  Window managers manage windows; screensavers blank the

See the xset command for how to disable this (man xset).

fvwm can move the cursor only relative to it's current position but if
you just want to go to the corners and you don't use virtual pages then
it is possible.

CursorMove 100 100 will zoom the cursor into the corner (if you have
virtual pages then it will just move the viewport down and right by one
page).

You can bind this to the keypad with
Key KP_7 A A CursorMove -100 -100
Key KP_9 A A CursorMove 100 -100
Key KP_3 A A CursorMove 100 100
Key KP_1 A A CursorMove -100 100

Your keyboard may not work with KP_7 etc. If it doesn't try running xev
an seeing what it prints out when you hit #7 in it. I get 

KeyPress event, serial 17, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,

Brad's patch doesn't apply to the functions.c in 2.2.  Poking around,
I see there's a 2.2.1.  Why doesn't the web page show that as the
"stable" version?  Anyway, what's the best way for me to get at an
fvwm with the applied fix.  A snapshot (which one?) or the latest
2.3.X?  I'm not afraid of working with alpha code although I'm
probably not able to help out as much as I tried to in the early 2.0.X 
development.

Thanks,

That was my mistake I should have sent that patch
to the workers-list, If you want to try the alpha
code just to make sure it works. you can grab
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-19990525.tar.gz

Unfortunatelly the function I patched was moved to a different file
between 2.2.x and 2.3.x, if you could check the snapshot and see if that
fixes your problem then I'll rework my patch for the 2.2.x series.

xset s off

(see man xset). And no, it has nothing to do with fvwm, it's a function of
the X server.

I am having a really weird problem with xconsole and fvwm placing it at
startup.

I start it with the following:

xconsole -file /dev/xconsole -bg black -fg green -font 5x7 -geometry 743x69+0+258 -xrm "*Page:3"

Yet when it starts it does not show on page 3.  If I bring up the
windowlist it list it with the geometry of: 743x69+0+198402.
                                                    ^^^^^^^^
                                                     yikes!!!
                                                     
If I select the window from the window list it brings the window to
+0+0. At which point I can then drag it to the appropiate place in the
window(+0+258).

I am running at 1024x768 on Debian Linux 2.1 with X 3.3.3.1, SVGA server
and fvwm 2.2.

This is the only window that does this.  Any clues as why this is
happening?

	The problem is that there is no such thing as "page 3": pages are
icentified by a pair of x,y coordinates relative to the page at the
upper left hand corner of the virtual desktop (0 0). If, for example,
you want to place the window on the third page of the top row of the
desktop grid, you would specify "FvwmPage: 2 0".

	You should take a closer look at the StartsOnPage option of the Style
command in the man page. If you specify only one argument, this means
you're specifying the desk, not the page. Two arguments specify a
relative page on the current desk, and three arguments specify desk and
page.

You have to find the file that defines the menus. It may be a system wide
file or located in your home directory. Look for $HOME/.fvwm2rc or a
system.fvwm2rc somewhere under /usr (assuming you are using Linux this
depends on the distribution you use). The second step is to locate
this line in the file:

  AddToMenu <menu name> "System" Popup <submenu name>

or

  + "System" Popup <submenu name>

or something similar. Delete this line and the menu entry vanishes upon
the next restart of fvwm. If you have trouble finding the file (e.g. if
you are using RedHat Linux) please tell us the name of your distribution).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

>=20

First, I don't use virtual desktops larger than my current desktop, so a
page in this case is a desktop.=20

             StartsOnPage takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If
             one  or  three  arguments  are givem, the first (or
             only) argument is the  desktop  number.=20

Second,=09I found a mistake(misunderstanding) in my config file.  I had a=
=20
Style "xconsole"   StartsOnPage 3 0 258.  I misunderstood the
'position' as X coordinates not page coordinates.  Thus 768 times
258 ~=3D 198402.  So I was putting it on the 258'th page of 1024x768
desk.
                                                        If  three
              arguments  are  given,  the  2nd  and 3rd arguments
              identify the x,y page position on the virtual  win=AD
              dow.
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                  I misunderstood this.
                                 =20
Third, command line arguments should always override config file
options. Thus even if I have the above Style defined in the fvwm
config, a comman line option using the xrm Xt option should override
it. Thus in my case I had the StartsOnPage set incorrectly in the
config file but was calling xconsole with a correct invocation of
"*Page:3". =20

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I'm having an odd problem with fvwm and a broken color map.  I've
compiled fvwm 2.2 with xpm support on Solaris 2.6.  The machine I'm
running it on is an Ultra 5 with a mach 64 derived video card (I can't
remember the specific model name).  It has 4MB of video memory, and I
run it true color mode.

When I start fvwm2, some of the colors (but not all) are inverted.
Colors like black and white, and red and cyan, are switched.  The
problem goes away when I run netscape -install and put the mouse
cursor inside the netscape window.

I don't think it's a problem with my X setup, since twm will run fine
without the color inversion.  Also, the problem exists with the
default .fvwm2rc, and my own .fvwm2rc.

Please keep me in the Cc: list, as I am not subscribed to this mailing
list at the moment.

I've applied the patch to 2.2 (and also tried out the snapshot from

	Aha! I noticed this relationship after I sent the reply, and wondered
what might be going on.

	As it happens, I'm looking at this area of the code at the moment, for
completely unrelated reasons. I'll look into this while I'm there.

I looked at the FAQ, but did not see anything about being able to
use FVWM under Exceed. I've used FVWM a while ago and
Loved it, and would really like to use it again. The difference is I'm
using Exceed to get to the Sun box. In the Xconfig setup there's
options to set the window manager - I'm not sure what I'd have to
default to and then kick off FVWM. Any suggestions on what I
need to do to make this happen ?

I've found that configuring Exceed to use XDM lets me kick off fvwm
from my .xsession as with other X terminals.

An experiment which gave me some grief was remotely executing an
.xinitrc/.xsession as an Xclient of Exceed.  What was happening
(unbeknownst to me at first) was that Exceed reset the Xserver
whenever it had zero clients.  My .xinitrc script was xset followed by
xrdb and then fvwm.  I found it difficult to understand why the xset
and xrdb had no effect.  The getaround was to put a persistent client
as the first entry, e.g. xclock&.  This held the Xserver open for the
other clients to connect to.

I gave up on the latter and use XDM to Solaris 2.6.  A further gotcha
is that I found that I had to use the OpenView profile.  CDE had a
nasty side effect of opening up an extra Xserver on the Sun's console, 
much to the displeasure of the person using it.

Hey all,

I have a Popup menu defined in my .fvwmrc and it has a ton of entries
(maybe 200). When I click my mouse button to get the menu, it is a
straight line down my screen that is only partially complete. How can
I get the Popup to do a multi-columned display so I can see all entries?

Thanks,

-doug

Not at all. The last entry sould be named 'more...'. If you move the pointer
over it you'll see the next page of entries.

I actually need *less* functionality from FvwmPager. I prefer a simple array
of plain buttons for a pager-- no outlines or icons denoting windows. The 
pager that comes with Gnome is essentially what I want, but I don't want to
run E or AfterStep just to use it. I've fiddled with different values of 
colors for Fore/Back/Hifore/Hiback/etc., but it just doesn't quite accomplish
what I'm looking for. I want all the panes to have one default color, and the
current active pane to have a different color. No other adornments. Well,
slight beveling would be nice.

Hi. I'm trying to write the value of a string to the FvwmPager title (the
one internal to the window which defaults to "Desk 0"). Putting:

*FvwmPagerLabel 0 $blah

in my .fvwm2rc prints the literal title "$blah".  Any ideas on the
correct notation? I'm running 2.2.

Also is it possible to turn the internal title off?

Cheers, Ben.

Ah, that's a good idea. But it still would be nicer to get all entries
at once somehow, because with the 'more' idea I need to hold the button
down while I go through each one...

I've just implemented the 'MaxWindowSize' command. It will be in the next
release.

Then you should use FvwmButtons, not FvwmPager. You can easily define
buttons looking the way you like there. E.g.:

  *FvwmButtons(Title Desk 1, Action 'GotoDesk 0')
  *FvwmButtons(Title Desk 2, Action 'GotoDesk 1')
  *FvwmButtons(Title Desk 3, Action 'GotoDesk 2')
  *FvwmButtons(Title Desk 4, Action 'GotoDesk 3')

This is not possible. You may be able to do something with the
preprocessor modules (FvwmCpp and FvwmM4).

Yes:

*FvwmPagerFont         none

That's right, but I'm not sure I will ever do it (I'm the menu guru
at the moment).

No, you don't. Simply use 'Menu' instead of 'Popup'. If you start
dragging without releasing the button it will work like a 'Popup'
menu, but if you simply click/release to bring up the menu it will
stay up. The 'more' entry has a '.' as hotkey, so if you hit the
period key repeatedly you can open the continuation menus fast.

Oops, replies to the wrong message. I think I wanted to say that the

I finally figured out how to log the errors that happened when I run x
windows. I was sure all my settings were right, but it seems that
themodes are not supported for the resolutions of 800 x 600, etc.
It also said FVWM2 is not installed.. I just downloaded the lastest
release.. what now?
I run dragonlinux witn xfree86 3.3.2 i think.

Hi!

You may or may not get an answer on this list.

Your problem appears  to be that "dragonlinux"  doesn't see that fvwm2
is installed.   Since this list is  for fvwm2,  not "dragonlinux", you
stand less of a  chance getting this question  answered here,  than if
you sent this question to "dragonlinux".  (Whatever that is.)

If,  when you say  you "downloaded  the latest release",  you mean the
latest fvwm2 release, we  can provide help on  how to compile  it.  So
if, thats the help you need, let us know.

> bucky.  ICQ 14271658  thanks all!

Hello,

This a very good idea that I tried at once !
(Desk 0 x seems better than GotoDesk x :o).
However, this leads me to a problem:
How can I use *Two* FvwmButtons (which can be 
started/killed independently) ? One for starting 
applications and the other for the above "pager".
Sorry if this question is a FAQ.

man FvwmButtons

       To use FvwmButtons with several different  configurations,
       you  can  invoke  FvwmButtons  with an optional parameter,
       which it will use as its name instead (e.g  "Module  Fvwm=AD
       Buttons  SomeButtons").   SomeButtons  will then read only
       the lines in the configuration file starting with  "*Some=AD
       Buttons", and not the lines belonging to FvwmButtons.

       You can also specify an optional configuration file to use
       instead of the default fvwm configuration file, by  giving
       a  second argument which is a filename. This will override
       the setting "*FvwmButtonsFile", see below.

	Ah, right. This depends on which version of FVWM you're using. The Desk
command has been renamed to GotoDesk in the current development sources
(for consistency with the GotoPage command); so if you use one of the
newer development snapshots, or the next major release, you should use
GotoDesk. Otherwise (for 2.2 and earlier), the command you need is Desk.
So, you're both right.

Um, I think he meant he downloaded fvwm2.

To install fvwm2:

  1) Unpack the fvwm-2.x.tar.gz whereever you like.
  2) cd into the fvwm directory.
  3) ./configure
  4) make
  5) as root: make install
  6) Find some config file you like (there are some examples in
     the distribution).
  7) Set fvwm2 as your default window manager (e.g. if you have a
     $HOME/.xinitrc file you should start it there).

If you have any problems you should look into the INSTALL.fvwm file.
If you still can't get fvwm to work (hopefully unlikely), ask the
list.

Bye

Dominik ^_^
