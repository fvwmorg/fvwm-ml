You need to find out how the binary was compiled for your system. fvwm2
expects to find the system.fvwm2rc file in a certain place (last I
compiled 2.0.46 it was something like /usr/X11/lib/fvwm2 or something like
that) and THAT is where the file needs to be.

See if you can find out how the package was compiled on your system, or
simply recompile the latest version yourself. The homepage address for
fvwm2 is at the end of this email.

Hello,

Here is how one can implement a custom wide system.fvwm2rc file without
having to put dotfiles in a user's home directory. The following only
applies to users starting fvwm2 under a Red Hat Linux 5.0 system (or above).
It will work for both users starting Fvwm2 with xinit (aka startx) in runlevel
3 as well as for users starting Fvwm2 with xdm in runlevel 5.
The runlevel is determined by the first uncommented line of the /etc/inittab
file:

----- begin /etc/inittab snippet ---------------------------------------------
#
# inittab       This file describes how the INIT process should set up
#               the system in a certain run-level.
#
# Author:       Miquel van Smoorenburg, <miquels@drinkel.nl.mugnet.org>
#               Modified for RHS Linux by Marc Ewing and Donnie Barnes
#

# Default runlevel. The runlevels used by RHS are:
#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#   1 - Single user mode
#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
#   3 - Full multiuser mode
#   4 - unused
#   5 - X11
#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#
#id:3:initdefault:
id:5:initdefault:
----- end /etc/inittab snippet -----------------------------------------------

So, here is how you do it:

Step 1)

Place your new configuration file under /etc/X11/fvwm2 as:

/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc

Step 2)

mv /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients.old

Step 3)

Use the following file as the new /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients file snipping
the parts containing dashes (-).

----- begin /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients ------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

########################################################################
# -*- sh -*-                                                           #
#                                                                      #
# ~/.Xclients: used by startx (xinit) to start up a window manager and #
# any other clients you always want to start an X session with.        #
#                                                                      #
# feel free to edit this file to suit your needs.                      #
########################################################################

exec fvwm2 -f /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc

----- end /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients --------------------------------------

Step 4)

If this still doesn't work then it may be because you may have a

".wm_config" file in your home directory. Delete it and try again.

Step 5)

Reboot your system and good luck!!!

Best Regards,

Neil

Whether or not this goes in for 2.2, I would prefer a different name.  I
see "replace" (replace this window with something else) when you appear
to mean "re-place" (re-do the placement of the window).

PS. You should really send patches and enhancements to the fvwm-workers
    list; that's where the developers hang out...

It won't. There will be no more new features in 2.2,
only bugfixes.

But nobody will be able to use his private .fvwm2rc in his homedirectory
then. You have to find out the default path for this file and just start
fvwm2 without the -f option. Try 'strace -eopen fvwm2' as I mentioned
before.

Neil,

  I'm glad this solved your problem.

  This does seem to be a fairly complicated solution to something thats
pretty straight forward with fvwm2 as I know it.

  Using fvwm 2.1.x installed with a prefix of /usr/local, if fvwm2 is
started with no arguments at all, fvwm2 will first attempt to read
$HOME/.fvwm2rc.  If that file is not found, it will then attempt
to read /usr/local/etc/.fvwm2rc.

  The "etc" part is the "sysconfdir" that you can set as you like at
configure time.

  So if you don't want each user to have to create his own .fvwm2rc
file, I believe the simplest answer is, just put the .fvwm2rc file
in "sysconfdir".

  Sorry I couldn't get it together to answer this question before now,
but I am just recovering from the flu.  (What a lousy way to spend the
holidays.)

To    my knowledge, fvwm2 does  not   attempt to  read    a file named
"system.fvwm2rc".

It simply gives itself the command "read .fvwm2rc" during startup.

The "read" command first looks in $HOME, if no file is found there, it
then looks in the system configuration directory.

The actual  name of  the  system configuration   directory used  to be
specified in the "Fvwm.tmpl"  file.  With our newer  "configure" based
installation process, its the "sysconfdir".

This is what the fvwm 2.0.46 comes as part of redhat 5.2 tries to do on
startup:

open(".fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY)              = -1 ENOENT 
open("/home/xyzzy/.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY)  = -1 ENOENT 
open("/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT
open("system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY)        = -1 ENOENT
open("/home/xyzzy/system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT
open("/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY) = 5

So it looks in the current dir, $HOME, and the sysconfdir, first for .fvwm2rc
and then for system.fvwm2rc.

This is what fvwm 2.1.6 does with no paticular options used at configure time:

open(".fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000)       = -1 ENOENT
open("/home/xyzzy/.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000) = -1 ENOENT
open("/usr/local/etc/.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000) = -1 ENOENT
open("system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000) = -1 ENOENT
open("/home/xyzzy/system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000) = -1 ENOENT
open("/usr/local/etc/system.fvwm2rc", O_RDONLY|0x8000) = -1 ENOENT

So basiclly the same thing, except the sysconfdir has changed from
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 to /usr/local/etc

I seem to remember the system config going in X11 lib directory from way back,
pre-fvwm2, so the move to etc is probably a recent change.

Fixed in the CVS tree (I think 2.1.6 should work too, if not you have
to wait for 2.1.7 or fetch the CVS source).

BTW, you can verify this without picking up the phone and starting ppp:

  asmodem -s -d minicom -h "killall minicom"

Perhaps somebody can explain what I am doing wrong.. When I use the attached 
.fvwm2rc I get the errors:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'SetMenuStyle' in ModulePath 
'/u
sr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.1.5/'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'ChangeMenuStyle' in

and the menu is titled "Utilities@linux-menu.xpm@" instead of having the 
pixmap down the side.

SetMenuStyle is a very recent command. I don't think it is in any of the
tar files. You will have to use CVS to get the latest version that
includes it. It will be in version 2.1.7 onwards.

Ahem, that's completely wrong ;-) SetMenuStyle was part of the
releases 2.1.3 to 2.1.6. In 2.1.6 the syntax was rewritten and
from 2.1.7 onwards there is no SetMenuStyle anymore. Specifically
there's no SetMenuStyle in the current CVS source. Its functionality
and syntax have been merged into MenuStyle. Paul seems to use
2.1.5 (at least his module path suggests this), so this should
work.

I've recently installed the latest XFREE86 server.  I think I've finally
have everything installed with two problems left.

Everything was installed with only root permissions so the server was
working fine in root, but not in my user account.  So I "chmod -R 755 *" in
the /usr/X11R6 directory.  I think I had my user account working, briefly
and mucked around.  Now I get an error:

[BEGIN ERROR]

It seams I screwed up a permissions somewhere.  Incidentally, when
installing such things, what permissions do you folks set the installation
to?  Was "chmod -R 755 *" the wrong approach?

The other problem is what the default server is.  I want to use the
accelerated server at 1280x1024 resolution, but I can't find out how to do
that.  I'm guessing it's using the VGA server at a very large resolution?
But I have /usr/X11R6/X -> XFREE86_SVGA for my S3 ViRGE/VX card.  ctrl-alt-+
doesn't do anything either.

Thanks for everyone's help.  It seams I didn't understand my initial X setup
as I thought I did.

ack! it seems to me that you recursively set permissions to 755 on
binaries that had (and needed) their suid bits set (effectively removing
them). You need to find out which binaries in that directory need to be

Oh my god, did you really do that? That means you have nuked the
permissions of *all* files and directories below /usr/X11R6 and
that are quite a lot. Just to give you an idea: On my system
there are 10808 files/directories there that don't have 755
as their permissions. I hope you have a good distribution since
you probably won't get your system running smoothly again without
reinstalling all packages that have something to do with X11 (i.e.
X itself and all X based applications).

chmod 4755 /usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper

You may need this too:

chmod 2755 /usr/X11R6/bin/xlock

Every file has its own permissions. You can't just put the same
permissions on every file. Or do you think setting the executable
bit would make a picture run like a program? You'll probably have
screwed up a few SUID or SGID bits.

Absolutely.

You need to run xf86config or perhaps some other fancy tool that
came with your distribution. There you can specify all the resolutions
you want to use.

Okay, okay, I know I screwed up.  I didn't know of a better approach and
didn't realize the consequences (the problem is bigger because I
accidentally did "chmod -R 755 *" in the /usr directory as well :(  ).

There appeared to be many directories with only root access that needed
global access for other accounts to be able to run.  I though "chmod -R 755
*" would take care of that.  I was obviously wrong.  The problem is actually
worse, as I first accidentally did that command in /usr.  Real BIG oops.
And no, I wasn't trying to execute picture files.  :)

Okay, what's the correct approach?  There seam to be many files that need
the permissions changed (directories and executables, etc.).  Is there a
file list or a better installation procedure?  I can easily re-install X,
but I want to know how to change to permissions to the appropriate files,
whichever they are.

I have all of the resolutions defined, but how do I get to those
resolutions?  I was planning on copying and pasting the accelerated "Screen"
sections first so see if the order matters.

Thanks for your help.

I  can confirm  that   starting a  second  "FvwmCommandS"  under 2.1.7
produces the "dead pipe" message.  (Of course, I don't consider this
to be a bug, only one copy should be needed.)  All we need now is for
Zack to confirm that this is what was happening...

First, note that this mailing list is not really the appropriate place
for these problems: this is for discussion of the fvwm window manager,
which is generic and runs on any version of UNIX and X and has nothing
to do with how to start the XFree86 server or the permissions of its
files.  You should probably continue this on the comp.os.linux.x or
comp.windows.x.i386unix newsgroups.

Second, all the permissions should be correct as-is on an installation.
Can you provide an example of permissions that you felt were incorrect,
and why you thought so (what didn't work that made you suspect a problem
with permissions)?  Whenever I install things they always have the right
permissions out-of-the-box.

One hint in general: it pays off to see what your commands *would* do
before really doing something recursive. If you have zsh, you could have
hit tab right after typing the asterisk 'chmod -R 755 *<TAB>' and all
the possible file names would have been completed on the command line.
You had seen your error fast here. If you want to act on directories,
use '*(/)' instead of '*' (zsh only again). Or use a for loop:

  # for i in `find . -type d`; do echo chmod 755 $i; done

If you like what you see, remove the 'echo' and go on. This
doesn't cost you much but can help immensely.

First of all your main problem is that /usr/X11R6 does not just contain
the X server but many applications too, so no simple recursive approach
will work. Basically it is no problem that some executables are root-only
since the X server runs as root (chmod 4755 /usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper).
Without ever having installed an X server on my own I suggest
trying these, first to last (assuming that you are running a Linux box):

1) See if your distribution can set the permissions for you. This may
   not be obvious and you may have to read some documentation on this
   topic (I can do it with my SuSE distribution).

2) Try to get the latest XFree86 package from your distributor. This
   should have the correct permissions set and can usually be
   downloaded for free.

3) Read the installation instructions carefully. There must be some
   hint how to properly install the X server so that everybody can
   use it.

Well, I never understood how these screen sections have to look,

I don't think the order matters but make sure that you are really
running the X server spcified in the 'Device' line. Try the
manpage for XF86Config. It describes the file format.

If you want to help fix this, you'll need to do the following:

  * Go back to "native" code, from a fresh distribution (either CVS or
    tar file), with no previous builds or anything.

  * Run script(1) and use the configure line with the proper
    --with-xpm-* options, so we can see exactly what you typed and
    exactly what configure typed.

  * Bundle the script output file with the config.log file and send it
    to the fvwm-workers list.

Thanks!

Thanks for everyone's help thus far for my fouled up X install.  I was
hoping for a simple solution, but it seems I messed things up pretty badly.
As for the permissions being correct after an installation, all of my X
executables were only root accessible, and could not be run from user
accounts.  Thus I started playing with chmod.  After many chmod's, I decided
to do it all at once which was a bad idea.

I'll re-install again and take my problems else where if I have them as
someone pointed out, this mail list is for fvwm discussion.

Thanks again for everyone's help.

I can't confirm it, but I can say that the problem has been fixed as of this
morning. I reinstalled Debian Slink and recompiled 2.1.5, and the problem
went away. I believe a lot of broken installations of 2.1.5 and/or 2.0.??
were interfering with each other. Serves me right for not being lazy enough.

Hi,

I'd like ctrl-alt-p to RaiseLower the FvwmPager. So far, the best I've been
able to do is write a Perl script that runs at fvwm startup, that takes the
output of 'FvwmCommand send_windowlist', derives the window id of the pager
from that data, and then uses FvwmCommand to bind a RaiseLower for that id
to ctrl-alt-p.

Actually for some reason it doesn't work with 'ctrl-alt-p', but does with
'ctrl-alt-i'. That's wierd. I have no idea why that happens.

But basically I'm hoping there's a simpler, faster way of doing it. My guess
is that it works with i but not p because I'm overcomplicating the whole
thing, and just missing a much simpler approach that's not as likely to
break (at least that's what I'm hoping for).

My current (non)solution is also not very robust because if I kill the pager
for some reason and start another one, the keybinding doesn't affect the new
pager; and since I'm trying to make this work for any user, not just me,
running the script by hand each time won't help.

Key p A CM Next [FvwmPager] RaiseLower

should do. Won't work well if you have multiple pagers though.

I'd bet the build/installation failed somewhere. Try rebuilding
fvwm in a clean directory. Watch closely what configure says.
Probably configure didn't find your xpm library. You may have
to specify this by hand. After installing make sure the right
executables are first in your PATH.

Maybe, but the indications are otherwise, if I use Utilities%linux-menu.xpm% 
the xpm _does_ appear (as an icon on the title).

  OK, I'll see if can do that at some point.

  OK, I have to admit to not having a clue what you mean by 'CVS' - I can
see nothing by this name in the Web or FTP sites, nor the FAQ.

  /However/, I *am* now running the 'development' 2.1.6 I found on the FTP
site, and my Netscape placement problem's been solved! I can now start
'netscape -iconic', with 'StartsOnPage 0 1' and everything comes up in the
right place.


  Here's the 'but'. I'm still having a problem that I'd not mentioned
before, with starting Solaris's 'clock' & 'cm'. Now, I used to start these
command-line iconic, but I now apply the 'StartsIconic' style (their
WM_CLASSes are set appropriately).

  However, they don't appear in the correct place as specified on their
command line:

   toolwait clock -geometry 132x70-9+143 -WP 1078 9 +Wn
   toolwait cm -geometry 877x419-80+50 -WP 1081 80

  They both come up at (0,0) ... until clicked upon, when they run over to
where they're supposed to be!? Actually, it's a bit worse than that - that
was with the iconic parameter; with clock having 'StartsIconic', it's icon
is a blank white box till I double-click open it & re-iconise it. Hence:

   FvwmCommand 'Function Bounce-Icon clock'  2>&1  > /dev/null
   FvwmCommand 'Function Bounce-Icon cm'     2>&1  > /dev/null

  ... in my start-up script, and:

+  "I" Function Bounce-Icon clock
+  "I" Function Bounce-Icon cm

  ... in my RestartFunction, with:

AddToFunc Bounce-Icon  \
   "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
+  "I" Wait $0
+  "I" Next [$0] Iconify  1

  Not nice, but it works!


  The other potential work-arounds are: don't give icon locations on the
command-line (with netscape, I gave a leading IconBox style of exactly the
corrds to use), and don't use 'em! (I guess I could get what I want from
FvwmButtons, but I've not yet looked into that at all).


PS
  Why doesn't the FVWM mailing list have itself as the Reply-To? I have to
keep changing the 'To' to prevent myself from emailing the missive to the
original author!

  I've just posted my 'solution' for cm & clock not coming up correctly.
However, in the 2.1.6 I'm running, it doesn't work any more. I *think*
it's FvwmCommand, and not fvwm itself, but I've no easy way of telling.

  I'll explain a little more; I do the Bounce-Icon thang in my
RestartFunction as well as my script, and neither the FvwmCommand login
version nor the RestartFunction version work. In fact, if I:

  FvwmCommand 'Function Bounce-Icon clock'

  My cm opens! (and doesn't close)!


  Things get unfortunately worse ... I can

  FvwmCommand 'Next [cm] Iconify -1'

  ... and nothing happens.

  FvwmCommand 'Next [cm] Iconify 1'

  .. then makes the window vanish! If I recover it from the WinList it
opens & immediately iconifies.


  And to top it all, after a little of this (in fact, what I've just
listed above), for some bizarre reason double-click on my icons to
de-iconify them has ceased to work!? I just get get the Move operation.


  Should I stop using 2.1.6?

Hi everyone,

The problem is probably, that Red Hat Linux 5.0 and 5.1 (I haven't tried 
5.2 yet) use a very complicated systemwide .xinitrc.  It tests a lot of 
configuration files to determine which window manager to use.  If you 
have chosen fvwm2 it will then fire up fvwm2 with a command line that 
causes it to read a specific system-wide configuration file through the 
M4 preprocessor.  The default configuration is split up in a large 
number of M4 files.  This *may* be very flexible, when/if you have 
figured out what is going on, but it makes it very difficult to get 
started modifying your setup.

I quickly discarded the default configuration by writing my own 
.Xclients (attached), which starts fvwm without funny arguments, and 
then I reused an old .fvwm2rc.  You may be able to replace the 
systemwide .xinitrc (or whatever it is called) with something similar.

Jakob

If what you want is to do multiple line shell scripty things from fvwm
you can always use the fact that any shell worthy of the name can do
everything on one line. e.g.

AddToFunc test "I" Exec for I in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo $I; done

If it's a real whopper of a script I would recommend you put in in a
separate file to be Exec'd from fvwm.  Big scripts get changed often and
including the script in the fvwm config will mean restarting fvwm every
time the script changes.

Cheers,
Tim.

It's on the web page, under "Docs, FAQ & Other Info".  See
http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/cvs.html.  CVS is the system by which multiple
developers contribute to the source code.  You can use it to get a complete

  Actually, I've partially followed a big thread on this wrt. the home
mailer I use. I don't recall there being a proper consensus: someone said
that 'Reply-To:' should be the 'personal reply' bit (i.e., to the author)
and the 'From:' the mailing-list ... but then someone else pointed to:

... the 'Majordomo FAQ'
<URL:http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~barr/majordomo-faq.html>
and the 'Mailing List Management Software FAQ'
<URL:ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.answers/mail/list-admin/software-faq>
for reference.

  Which, to quote his summary, say:

 - Replies should be sent to Reply-To: field if present (mailing list
   software should set this to point to the 'posting address')
 - The Author's Email address should always be shown in the From:
   field (if the Reply-To: field isn't set, this address should be
   used)
 - The actual poster (if the author is using another machine) should
   have the address shown in Sender: (if not present, assume From:)
 - Errors-To: /may/ be set to the administrator of the mailing list
   (if applicable) or the administrator of the sending machine.
   Mailer-Daemon software should send failure messages et al to this
   address.

  Either way, shouldn't we have /both/ a 'From:' and 'Reply-To:',
whichever way around they go?

CVS == Concurrent Versioning System

This is a source code control system used by many of the Open Source
projects.  One of its prime advantages is that it is "internet aware"
and you can check out and in code across the net.  And it's free
software, of course :).

Also, you can check out (only) code anonymously, so if you have a CVS
client you can obtain up-to-the-second source code directly from the
development tree to play with, if you like.

  http://www.cyclic.com/

I'm surprised you didn't find anything about CVS on the web pages, I'm
pretty sure there's a discussion of how to obtain sources via CVS, etc.
Yep, look under the "Docs, FAQ, & other Info" link:

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/docs.html

These problems with Openlook have been around a while now.

I haven't tried it, but possibly removing the -WP from the command line
and giving the application its own iconbox will help.

A while ago I switched from "cm" to "/usr/dt/bin/dtcm" which seems to be
Motif based and doesn't seem to have the same problems.

Here are the X-resources I use to place "dtcm":

! This places dtcm where I like it, using all known screen sizes.
! Basically, -142 pixels off the right edge:
#if ( WIDTH == 1152 )     /* Traditional Sparc */
dtcm*iconX: 1010
#elif ( WIDTH == 1280 )   /* Sparc 21 inch */
dtcm*iconX: 1138
#elif ( WIDTH == 1024 )   /* Exceed in 1024x768 mode */
dtcm*iconX: 882
#else                     /* I have no idea...guess 800x600 */
dtcm*iconX: 658
#endif
dtcm.iconY: 93
dtcm.geometry: 610x450

There doesn't seem to be a "dtclock" to replace "clock" however.

Does anyone know how to force an icon (in my case netscape mail messanger)
to a specific corner of the window upon startup of fvwm? No matter what I
do, it keeps putting it with my other icons in the IconBox. I'd like to
put it next to my clock and performance meters in the upper corner of the
window. We're not using v2.x here yet (we're running 1.24r), so that may
be the problem, I dunno. Any ideas?

Bob

This doesn't make any sense.

If Reply-To exists, then From is ignored.  The purpose of Reply-To is
for users to be able to reset their reply address to something other
than what the mailer inserts: note that with many mailers and sendmail
configurations the From address is either hardcoded and not changeable
by the user, and/or munged by the delivery agent (to use a cononical
domain name, or something).

Reply-To is (should!) always left unmolested, so users can specify a
preferred reply address using that.

  nb>   Either way, shouldn't we have /both/ a 'From:' and 'Reply-To:',

If you have both, it doesn't matter what the From address is as it's
ignored.

Check the URL I posted for more details.

I am using fvwm2, but this non-fvwm set of XResources does the job for
me:

Netscape*IconX: 20
Netscape*IconY: 20

In X, the window manager controls the root window and the borders of
windows.

Anything that happens within the borders is completely out of the
control of the window manager, and must be configured by the application
itself.  So, we can't really help you.

One thing to check is if you're running out of colors.  If you only have
an 8-bit display you can only display 256 colors at once.  If you have
color-intensive apps (colorful backgrounds, Netscape, etc.) they can eat
all the colors so that new apps can't allocate any.  The app will
probably print some errors or warnings if this is the case.  Try
shutting down Netscape, using a simple background, etc.

Name matching for Next/Prev/... is broken in 2.1.6. That is the
reason why 2.1.6 is no official beta but an alpha release.

If you can set things sticky and staysontop (as part of a style)
there are also counterparts that do the reverse.
So, looking in the man page, I find Slippery and StaysPut
as opposites of Sticky and StaysOnTop.

Add these to the style of your FvwmPager (I guess that's the
window you're talking about).

Maybe this behaviour is caused by a global setting of Sticky and
StaysOnTop for Fvwm* windows.
So, it's important to define the FvwmPager style AFTER (below)
the style for Fvwm*, because otherwise it'll be overridden nicely.

Hope this helps.

Now you know why 2.1.6 is in the testing directory and no announcement was
ever made for it.

Folks, if you want to try out test releases, fine, but be prepared to join
the workers list and participate in development.  We knew 2.1.6 was borked
over a week ago, discussed it on fvwm-workers and decided not to release
it.  Worming around the server and downloading something from a directory
named "testing" is not the best way to pick up a bug-free release.

I've added a warning to this effect on the FTP server.

  Hmm. I've looked at the RFC; to quote 4.4 "Reply-To/Resent-Reply-To":
        ...  A
        somewhat  different  use  may be of some help to "text message
        teleconferencing" groups equipped with automatic  distribution
        services:   include the address of that service in the "Reply-
        To" field of all messages  submitted  to  the  teleconference;
        then  participants  can  "reply"  to conference submissions to
        guarantee the correct distribution of any submission of  their
        own.

  To my mind, that says that mail-lists ought to have the 'Reply-To' set
to the list itself. Presumably, it would be preferable to /only/ do this
if the author's not set it (or change theirs to 'Resent-').

  I don't know - this has gone a little too far OT to warrant continuing
much further. Personally [if it works], I'll try to remember to add
'Reply-To: fvwm' to my postings in the future.

After looking thorugh the code I'd say the @...@ has to be applied
to the menu name, not the title:

  AddToMenu Utilities@linux-menu.xpm@ "Utilities" Title

Did you have any success with Set/ChangeMenuStyle ?

I tried it and it doesn't work. You also need to invoke it as 
Utilities@linux-menu.xpm.

Does somebody actually have a working example?

Since function is allegedly transient (to be absorbed by MenuStyle) I

Have a look at the manpage. The example there is correct although
the text is not. The scan for side pics is done only the first
time the name of the menu is used (i.e. when the menu is created):

This one is ok:

  DestroyMenu Utilities
  AddToMenu Utilities@linux-menu.xpm@
   + "Utilities" Title

This one too:

  DestroyMenu Utilities
  AddToMenu Utilities@linux-menu.xpm@ Utilities Title

But this won't work:

  DestroyMenu Utilities
  AddToMenu Utilities "some item" Nop
  AddToMenu Utilities@linux-menu.xpm@ Utilities Title

There's a typo in the manpage saying the menu label
is evaluated, not the name. Apart from this it is
quite misleading.

Bye

Dominik

What's the big deal?  I can't believe we're still harping on this
issue.  Just use "reply to all" in your email client and everything
should work just fine -- unless of course the author puts in a
Reply-To and it messes everything up.

  Hi.  I'm working on extending fvwm via a system of scripts, using the
FvwmCommand module as the interface; and I'm having trouble getting the
scripts all the info they need.  I use "send_windowlist", but I've
never seen any documentation for it (is there any?) and I don't know if
I'm making full use of it.  Are there any other undocumented commands?

  Also, my scripts need info about the state of fvwm itself (as opposed
to the windows it's managing) such as "What key bindings are currently
in effect?" or "What is EdgeScroll set to?".  Is there a way to ask
fvwm such questions?

Send_windowlist is documented:

http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/mod_m2f_communication.html

If you find any other commands that you think are undocumented,
let us know.

As  the need to  retrieve this kind  of  information appears, fvwm has
been modified to send it.  You would need to  change fvwm2, and submit
a patch.

Has anyone tried using fvwm-1.24r with Exceed for Win32 Version
6.1.0.10?
What about other combinations of versions of fvwm and Exceed?
What are your experiences?

Thanks,
Noel

I'm using Fvwm2 with Exceed 6.1. Not really any bug but sometimes a lot
of network traffic is generated.  If I hit Shift-UpArrow in rxvt to
scrolling the terminal window down the cursor starts to flicker.  I'm
pretty sure this is nothing to do with fvwm and is probably Exceed being
naughty.

Cheers,
Tim.

I made this patch to get the same behaviour as in vtwm (e.g. snap to
screen edges too). I added a simple configuration option for
SnapAttraction, Edges (ex. 'SnapAttraction 10 All Edges'). It's a bit
ad hoc, but works. (If this is going to be included in the
distribution, the configuration should probably be checked and rewritten.)

Enjoy,

Well, back in the olden days (1993/4/5) I used fvwm1 with an unknown version
of Exceed at university. There were no problems specific to fvwm, though
it would often construct circles out of random dots that would accumulate
over time (the most amusing graphics glitch I've ever seen), and its habit
of grabbing colours out of the colourmap to draw a pointless Win 3.1
titlebar at the top was annoying.

> What are your experiences?

fvwm works great. Exceed probably needs a bit of work. Oh, and of course
fvwm will only do anything when Exceed is running in full-screen mode...
otherwise Exceed manages individual windows itself. The online documentation
was lacking at the time, and reconfiguration was a bit painful, but I expect
those things are long fixed.

Trouble is, that on many mailers, "reply to all" will send to the list AND
the originator of the message, who ends up with two copies. Even worse, when
there's a big thread like this, the To: line just keeps on growing and
growing and growing. My prefered mailer, mutt, has a list-reply function,
which always does the right thing, but at the cost of having to put the
names of all the lists I'm on in my .muttrc.

In conclusion, though I'm aware of the various issues with munging the
Reply-To: line, it is the solution which works least badly with the greatest
proportion of mailers. The Reply-To: line is rarely used in the "I'm not
really there, I'm here" fashion, since it's so easy to just forge the From:
line, and as a result renaming that header to something else and replacing
it will cause distress it such a miniscule proportion of cases as to not be
worth considering.

None of this is very important to the fvwm list though, which probably has
among its readers a greater proportion of people using sane RFC-compliant
email software combined with functioning grey matter than most mailing lists
on the Internet.

Hi,

I just installed fvwm2.1.5, and am having problems.
Whenever a window with focus is closed, the mouse changes from 
the standard icon (whatever the client defined) or the standard
X (if the mouse is in the root window) to the round 'selection' cursor
that fvwm uses to pick a window. I've scoured the manpage but I can't seem
to find anything that would change this behaviour. 

Has anyone seen this before?
I'd post my .fvwm2rc but I don't even know the relevant parts...

Jeff

Any particular reason that you need to change the behaviour?  I wouldn't
call it a bug (Personally) since it's an indication that no window
currently has input focus (I think ... it's a bit early for me to be
sure!).  Personally I never see it (Due to my focus settings, with focus
following the mouse and sloppy focus ...)

However I'm still on 2.0.46 so things may have changed ...

Is this just a question of aesthetics or would you like the actual
*behaviour* to change in which case how would you like things to work?

The Style commands are the interesting parts. Can you give
us a step-by-step description how to reproduce this?

	I had the same problem. The source of the problem was the 
following line.

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I"
+               "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+               "I"     Module FvwmAuto 50 raise lower
						^^^^^^^
The FvwmAuto man page says that leavecommand will executed after the
timeout. If window with focus is closed, then it loses focus and hence the
lower command will not have an argument. Hence it asks you to supply one
(by changing the shape of pointer). I removed lower and the problem
disappered.

Though it works, am i right about the explanation ?

HTH,
syam

PS :- 
<wild speculation with no knowledge> 
What is going wrong, is fvwm giving FvwmAuto incomplete information or is
FvwmAuto mucking up? the leavecommand should probably not be exeuted when
window loses focus because of death.

Hi,

I have a problem with the InitFunction and RestartFunction. I can't seem
to access them from other than the first commandfile given to fvwm.
I i eg. startup fvwm2 (2.1.5) like:

fvwm2 -f systrem.fvwm2rc -f user.fvwm2rc

There is no way (i found) to set/change/destroy the init/restart functions
from the user.fvwm2rc file? I can destroy and add to menus, but not to
these functions. Anyone have any clues for this problem?

Best Regards,
Jesper James

Yes, you are. The FvwmAuto line is nonsense.  Both Raise and Lower
operate on the window with focus.  If there isn't a focus window Fvwm
will display the dot prompt and wait for you to select a window. The
FvwmAuto line will do the Raising OK provided you don't lose focus
within 50ms of entering but will absolutely not lower the window that
just lost focus.  What probably happens is that when moving from one
window to another the leave event happens before the enter event and
both happen to the window that is the focus window. This gives a lower
then raise so you may not notice the lower.

You can't get fvwm to lower the window you just left but you may be able
to do it with a FvwmCommand script or with FvwmScript.

Cheers,
Tim.

Yes, but all I have to do is left click on ANYTHING and the cursor
returns to normal.  Not exactly a serious bug, but everything hangs
until I click that mouse button.

Hi,

I'm having a problem whenever I restart fvwm2. I get some default
decoration on the windows instead of what is in my .fvwm2rc file. Yet,
everything works fine when I start fvwm2 the first time.

I get the following error:
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
/home/fxb/fvwm2/libexec/fvwm/2.1.4/ BorderStyle
(the list goes on and on with all the commands related to style).

I don't quite understand why "BorderSytle" is interpreted as a module.

Does anyone have the same problem?

I'm using v2.1.4, but the same thing was happening with 2.0.46.
Attached is my .fvwm2rc file

Thanks,
-- 
  Fred

Allo..

Eterm (0.8.7) crashes when I Recapture in Fvwm (2.0.46).  This isn't a
big problem, (most likely a bug in Eterm, not fvwm) but I'm curious what
sort of messages Fvwm sends to windows when they are recaptured.

I remember somebody had the same problem but with
SnapAttraction instead of BorderStyle. Perhaps
we can reproduce it with your config file.

No, I don't get this. Is it possible you have some
very old fvwm somewhere in the PATH that gets
executed when you restart?

Silly me... You are right, that was the problem.

Wow, I've been mildly annoyed by this problem from time to time for ages
now, but it never occurred to me that it might be FvwmAuto that was causing
it. I'm just running FvwmAuto as

Module FvwmAuto 500

So it's not the optional arguments that are the cause of the problem. I'd
say it was a bug in FvwmAuto. It should be checking if the window still
exists before issuing the command on it.

Check that you don't have another fvwm2 in your path ("which fvwm2" should
tell you which version of fvwm2 is getting run by default). I have a hunch
that a different version of fvwm is getting run when you do the restart.

Here's what I want to do.  Whenever a popup window appears in Netscape (say
I pressed M-l or M-f or it's asking me if I really want to submit the
form), I want the keyboard focus to go to the popup.  When the popup
disappears, I want the focus to return to whatever window it was in before
(though I'd settle for a Netscape window, as long as it was the one I came
from).

As far as I can tell, the tool to use here is FvwmEvent.  What I've gotten
is the following.

    AddToFunc FocusIfTransient    "I" Next (*_popup) Focus
    
    *FvwmEventCmd FocusIfTransient
    *FvwmEvent add_window FocusIfTransient

This works just fine.  The popup appears, and it immediately gets focus.
However, when it disappears, although the mouse pointer is still in the
Netscape window (I use focus follows mouse), it doesn't get the focus (no
window does, as far as I can tell) unless the pointer was inside the popup
to begin with (a situation in which all this rigmarole is unnecessary).

I can't for the life of me, though, figure out how to do the second half
here.  I've tried putting in the appropriate FvwmEvent stuff:

    *FvwmEventCmd UnFocusIfTransient
    *FvwmEvent destroy_window UnFocusIfTransient

But I can't figure out what to put in UnFocusIfTransient, particularly so
that it doesn't get called on *every* window destroy.

So -- is there a way to do it without making any modifications?  Also, is
it a bug that focus does not return to the original window on its own?

This is using the CVS version dated Dec 19 21:31.

I think the problem is that no event is triggered when you
destroy a window, even the one with the focus. In general it
is correct that no window receives the focus when the one
that had it is destroyed. The focus is given to a new window
only when you enter a new window with the pointer (with
SloppyFocus and Mouse Focus). This generates an EnterNotify
event that takes care of the focus.

  Hmm. I've just added this - looked like a good idea - and it works fine
as it is. This is 2.1.7, with SloppyFocus FollowsMouse.

  I'm using 'WarpToWindow 50 33' not Focus, though, so I'd guess it's not
working for you 'cos the pointer's not inside the popup when it dies (as
it is for me), which would effectively make it 'enter' the main window
beneath.

It's a bug.  I'll enter a bug report under the postponed category so we
won't fix in until after 2.2.  In the mean time you could use FvwmCpp to
read both these files in:

fvwm2 -cmd FvwmCpp something.f

something.f:
#include "systrem.fvwm2rc"
#include "user.fvwm2rc"

The problem is that the StartupStuff routine is called by the Read
command after the first Read command is run!  Not really the best place,
it should be in main() just before the MainLoop is entered.

Cheers,
Tim.

(fvwm 2.1.5)

I'm using SetMenuStyle and ChangeMenuStyle to customize the appearance
of my menus.  Is there any way to make these customizations apply to
the builtin WindowList as well ?  The MenuStyle command appears to
affect the coloring, font, etc. of the WindowList, but it does not
have the option that allows to do things make the background be a
pixmap like SetMenuStyle does.  I can't get ChangeMenuStyle to affect
the WindowList.  Is there any way to make the builtin WindowList be
backed by a pixmap ?

Speaking of which, in 2.0.46 if you define an InitFunction in a file which is
processed by FvwmCpp as a result of a call from a .fvwm2rc file then it
doesn't take effect, while if you process that same file by means of a
command-line FvwmCpp as above then it works.  Is that the same bug or a
different one?

Don't use postponed for this. There are only bugs that we can't
fix before something else happens (or that ar really owhere in
sight). Just leave it in incoming

The WindowList always uses the default MenuStyle. If you give
that one the background pixmap WindowList will get it too.
Unfortunately you can't use ChangeMenuStyle on the WindowList

The reason is that there is a subtle change in the requiremnets in the
.fvwm2rc file that were accepted previously. I think the nuance may
have occurred when I ran the conversion script to go from fvwm1 to fvwm2
but it has been so long that I forget now.

Here is what I had to change in our global fvwm2rc file. It works correctly
with fvwm2*.

  Here's a snippet from my .fvwm2rc :

#   for the root window:
Mouse 1 R       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 2 R       A       WindowList
Mouse 3 R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop

#   for the title bar buttons:
Mouse 0 1       A       Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse 0 3       A       Close
Mouse 0 2       A       Maximize-Func
Mouse 0 4       A       Iconify

#   for other parts of the window/borders/icons:
Mouse 1 T       A       Move-or-Raise
Mouse 1 SF      A       Resize-or-Raise
Mouse 1 I       A       Move-or-Iconify
Mouse 1 WITSF   1       Move-or-Raise		# This bit
Mouse 2 TSIF    A       RaiseLower
Mouse 2 W       1       RaiseLower
Mouse 3 I       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 3 I       1       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 3 FST     A       Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
Mouse 3 WITSF   1       Menu Window-Ops2 Nop


  Can anyone tell me why the tagged line *isn't* allowing me to pick up
and move a window (e.g., xterm) by holding Sun's diamond 'meta' (which is
modifier '1' OK elsewhere - certainly for Keys stuff) and
left-click-dragging doesn't do anything (except change the pointer to an
up-left arrow from xterm's caret)?

  The Meta-Menu doesn't work, either.

  What've I done?

  I have a feeling this worked under 2.1.5 (I'm now running 2.1.7 - I
think our firewall's stopping CVS wokring), but I won't swear to it.

I don't catch what this has to do with the BorderStyle/Restart
problem. Please elaborate. Apart from this I think the problem
was solved.

But that is impossible by design: FvwmAuto is a module, so it runs
asynchronously to fvwm. The X server is also asynchronous to both, so Xlib
won't help.

This was discussed here (several times) in the past, since Rob Nation took
AutoRaise out of fvwm and put it in a module...

I have a few questions to narrow down where the problem
comes from. Please answer them evem if the 'M' as a modifier
solves your problem.

1) By saying 'the tagged line *isn't* allowing me to ...' you imply
   that the other lines with '1' do all work. Correct?

2) Does the binding fail on all parts of the window? The other
   line (see above) seems to work on the client window (correct?)
   so I'd guess the binding fails on 'ITSF' only. So, on which of
   the five parts does it work?

3) Could you verify if it was already broken with 2.1.5 or not?
   Hope you didn't throw away the source.

4) What does xmodmap say about your bindings? Please post the
   output of 'xmodmap -pm', 'xmodmap -pk' and 'xmodmap -pke'
   (only the lines with the meta keys for '-pk' and '-pke'
   please).

5) Do you use SloppyFocus? This may affect how bindings work
   (no it's not documented).

6) The pointer you get when clicking on the window, is it the
   same as when you move the pointer over the title bar of a
   window without clicking?

Bye

Dominik

The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the third official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.7). Available at

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/

it includes the following features (entries with '+' are new in
this beta):

+) New syntax for menu styles (MenuStyle) with greatly improved
   configurability (the SetMenuStyle command from previous betas
   has been merged into MenuStyle, please make sure to change
   your .fvwm2rc on that).
+) The growing windows bug from the last betas has been fixed
   (if you see it again, please contact fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu).
+) AutoHide bugfixes for FvwmTaskBar (EdgeThickness command).
+) New commands DefaultFont, DefaultColors and Emulate. The
   SetMenuDelay command from the previous betas has been removed.
*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug tracking
   system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour with WindowList
   command.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).
*) Mini title windows for FvwmPager (aka Balloons).
*) FvwmEvent is the successor of FvwmAudio. FvwmAudio is still
   available.
*) FvwmTile and FvwmCascade modules were replaced by
   FvwmRearrange. Shells for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade provide
   backward compatibility.
*) Improved FvwmButtons button placement to give absolute control
   over where the buttons are placed.
*) Color limiting (previously available thru patches).
*) Multiple Icon Boxes, Icon box grids, and Icon box fill
   direction control (previously available thru patches).
*) Faster startup.
*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability.
*) Many small enhancements too numerous to list here.
*) Consistent copying policy.
*) GNU autoconf support.

A lot of bugs have been fixed since fvwm-2.1.4.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be
found at:

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/NEWS.html

Although the maintainers feel this beta is quite stable there are
some known problems that shall be fixed before the final release
(and some that will have to wait). You can find a list of known
bugs in the BUGS file at the top level of the distribution.

Before you report a bug, please read the manpages, the NEWS file
and the FAQ too. If you can solve your problem this way but still
feel the information was too hard to find, please tell us.

To submit a bug, please follow the link to the FVWM bug tracking
system on our web page.


Beta testers needed urgently:
=============================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.

Hello all!

	I would like to suggest a new IconBox feature: AutoArrange.

This would work like in e.g. Window Maker. When a window is deiconified or
destroyed the iconfied windows would rearrange and move to fill the box
from where it "starts". This way icons in the IconBox would not end up
scattered all over after a while. 

I know that this is a feature a lot of people miss in fvwm*, even me myself
know a lot of people who have whined about it. It shouldn't be to hard to
implement either, IMHO, just scanning through the list of existing windows
each time a window is deiconified or destroyed and then rearrange the ones
that are still iconified.

Me myself don't feel competent enough to make a flawless patch and then keep
it up-to-date with the current /fast/ development, so I'm hoping one of the
developers read this and finds my suggestion reasonable. It would make fvwm2
/even/ more complete.

Thanks for listening. Your making a great job. Keep it up. /Linus Nilsson

Hi,

In mwm, when I press upper border (the top one), I get "resize" (as pressing the
corners).  
How to make Fvwm2 to act the same ?

Thanks,

Bind the resize builtin to both the Frame (corners) and the Sides
by putting a line like this in your .fvwm2rc.

Mouse 0 FS A Resize

This binds any mouse button (with any modifier keys pressed) in
the frame or sides to the resize action.

I just downloaded 2.1.7 but noticed that some mouse bindings stopped
to work.  I removed everything irrelevant from rc-file and I have only
the following line in my file.

	Mouse 1 A M move

When I have meta key down and press the left button on a window, the
cursor changes into an arrow, but the window does not move when I move
the mouse.  (No, I do not have num-lock on :)  However, it works if I
click on handles or titlebar.  It also works if I click the root
window - the cursor goes into move mode and I can grab a window and
move it.

The problem is not in modifiers, because it does not work with Ctrl or
Hyper either and also the following does not work either.

	Mouse 1 A A move

At least fvwm grabs the click, because the copying from xterm does not
work.  

I may peek a little in the sources when I have time, but I mailed here
because this might be some stupid-user-error. :)

Would you please enter this into our bug database (which keeps track
of enhancement requests too)? Just follow the links to the bug tracking
tool from our homepage ( http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/ ). If you feel
you can create such a patch you should do so. Don't worry about bugs,
we usually take a close look at patches before applying them. Although
no new patches will make it into 2.2 this is a particularly good time
to write this since we already had our 'feature freeze' for 2.2. Only
bugfixes will go in for a while so don't worry about the 'fast development'.
We have an *incredibly* long to do list after 2.2 already so writing
a patch yourself is the fastest way to get that feature.

BTW, keeping your patches up to date is almost trivial if you just
keep your sources up to date with CVS. It's not very likely that
someone will touch the icon box code at any moment.

> Your making a great job. Keep it up.

Thanks.

 I've just installed fvwm2 2.1.5 for Intel Red Hat Linux, i am wondering
how to:

1.  Uninstall fvwm2 so I can install it in a different location - i
don't want redundant files hanging around. I installed it in the default
directories, but I want to install it to /usr/X11R6/lib/fvwm2

2 Is there any documentation about the configuration file ie,
fvwm2.sample.  I know there are samples that other people have done, but
i'd rather read what each section does.

3.  Also, is there a program that codes the colours from say, grey
numeric value, ie,  808080

Thanks alot

There's a GNU standard "make uninstall" rule that fvwm supports but,
I'll be honest, I doubt anyone has ever run it before.  It'll probably
work OK.  Note it won't delete any of the new directories created, I
don't think (/usr/local/lib/fvwm/2.1.5 for example).

Alternatively you should be able to just:

  # rm -f /usr/local/bin/fvwm2
  # rm -f /usr/local/bin/xpmroot
  # rm -rf /usr/local/lib/fvwm
  # rm -f /usr/local/man/man1/fvwm2.1
  # rm -f /usr/local/man/man1/xpmroot.1
  # rm -f /usr/local/man/man1/Fvwm*.1

I think that gets it all.

  sh> 2 Is there any documentation about the configuration file ie,

The fvwm2 man page contains extensive documentation on all the
configuration file commands.

  sh> 3.  Also, is there a program that codes the colours from say, grey

Not with fvwm.  Some of the color chooser apps might do this.  Note I
think fvwm understands many different color code styles.

Hi


The (possible) bug:

I'm currently running fvwm 2.1.7 on a (slightly modified)
Slackware Linux (kernel 2.2.0pre6, XFree86 3.3.3) system.
I've modified the WinListFunc as follows in my .fvwm2rc:

DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ "I"	WindowId $0 FlipFocus
+ "I"	WindowId $0 Raise
+ "I"	WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 0 0
+ "I"	WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

When I select a window from the WindowList builtin, everything
happens as planned (top left corner of window in top left corner
of screen, cursor in middle of window), but fvwm gives me the
window selection cursor (the one you get when [for instance] you 
tell fvwm to "maximize" and then have to select a window), and waits
for me to click before focusing the window.  This obviously shouldn't
happen, as I've stepped through this function using FvwmTalk, and
everything worked perfectly.

I don't _remember_ having this problem under fvwm 2.1.5 (with the same
.fvwm2rc, except for adding the new MenuStyle builtin).


The suggestion or two:

I use the side pixmap on menus (the one you get when you use
	
	AddToMenu "Utilities@utilities.xpm@%navyblue%"

), but find it rather awkward.  What would be pretty cool is
if you could have SidePixmap and SideColor (for instance) as 
MenuStyle options:

	MenuStyle "Utilities" SidePixmap utilities.xpm
	MenuStyle "Utilities" SideColor navyblue

Another thing (extension of the first suggestion) would be a 
"WindowList" MenuStyle, which would apply only to the WindowList
builtin menu, as it looks rather drab (in my eyes) without the
side pixmap:

	MenuStyle "WindowList" SidePixmap winlist.xpm
	MenuStyle "WindowList" SideColor green

This is a suggestion only; I can live without it if neccessary,
and I'm not going to figure out the source code to patch fvwm.
I'm just too lazy, I guess.


The Grand Finale:

That's it.
I'll find any replies (eventually) in the archives, or mail them
directly to me if you really feel like it (kobus.retief@pixie.co.za).

Cheers
Koos

It's a bug that has already been fixed in the CVS tree.

  [you asked before: I'm using Sloppy/Follows focus]

  AFAICT, all but the those two work; e.g., my '1' key bindings work,
picking alternate menus off icons works (Meta picks a dif. one to normal).
However, the Meta-drag and Meta-menu just change the xterm cursor to a
'standard' arrow, and nothing else. The other bindings work as expected
with Meta held down, as set with the 'A' any/all definitions.

  Nope, that's another one that fails. Works on the title bar, but that's
because of the
  Mouse 2 TSIF    A       RaiseLower
  ... before it.

  Still got the exe. When I've finished typing this out, I'll 'draft' it &
take to time to restart with 2.1.5.

  [Yes, works a treat under 2.1.5.]

  OK:

> xmodmap -pm
xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x6a),  Shift_R (0x75)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x16)
control     Control_L (0x53),  Control_R (0x7e)
mod1        Meta_L (0x7f),  Meta_R (0x81)
mod2        Mode_switch (0x14)
mod3        Num_Lock (0x69)
mod4        Alt_L (0x1a)
mod5        F13 (0x20),  F18 (0x50),  F20 (0x68)

  Looks like mod1 is Meta OK.

    127         0xffe7 (Meta_L) 
    129         0xffe8 (Meta_R)

keycode 127 = Meta_L
keycode 129 = Meta_R

  I don't think I've ever fiddled with the Meta definitions in my set-up.

  Yup. Sloppy/Follows. The focus is set to the window the pointer's in
when the things fail.

  Yup, that's the one.

  Right, I'll try 2.1.5 now ...

  I've become rather attached to my setup, as one does, but with the
problems I'm having with fvwm2 & OpenLook apps., I'm looking at replacing
my trio of sticky corner apps, (perfmeter, clock & cm) with a 2x2
FvwmButtons thing.

  +-+-+
  |p|k|
  + +-+  Perfmeter, clocK, Cm
  | |c|
  +-+-+

  Can anyone recommend:

  a) another clock that'll show the seconds hand? [maybe even let me have
my roman numerals too]

  b) a perfmeter that will actually be Swallowed (FvwmButtons doesn't
complain, but doesn't swallow it, either) that can show CPU usage as well
as xload's load.

 c) a way of showing the day+month (as cm's icon does) in a button that
could launch cm. Is ther a way of docking an app.'s *icon* in FvwmButtons
that I've missed?

  TIA!

  Is someone going to rebundle 2.1.7 at some point, then?  It seems
silly to continue distributing a release (that was just announced,
even) with this significant of a known bug...

I don't mind telling people it's broken. 2.1.7 is a beta.
That explains everything. Betas may be buggy and are not
meant to be used in production. I don't see a reason why
we should make new releases fast becaus of bugs as long
as they don't really break up fvwm completely.

Having a release cycle that is too short might discourage
people to use all these betas. I think 2.1.8 should not
come before next week.

  So what do you recommend people use in production?  I was under the
understanding that all of 2.x was beta.  Is 2.0.46 recommended as
"production", or some sort?

  Agreed, but if you're recommending 1.x as "production", then it
should be argued that that release cycle is way too long...

It is and it is not. It has proven stable for years now,
so it is the recommended release (although not officially).
2.0.46 is not a beta in the same way 2.1.x is. While some older
releases were commonly taken as 'stable', the new 2.1.x series
(and all with an odd number in the second digit) deserves the
label 'beta'. The betas are strictly debugging releases now.

It is and we're aware of it. There has never been an official fvwm2
release and the last 2.0.x has been ages ago. That's why we are all
so busy to finally get the 'stable' 2.2. I hope in the future we
can settle with a more healty release cycle. I think 2.4, the next
'stable' release after 2.2 should be ready this year, not five years
in the future as it has been in the past (OK, I'm pushing it a bit).

Given the mouse modifier problem,  if you are  not downloading to help
the fvwm testing effort, I would recommend 2.1.4 over 2.1.7.

No.  All of 2.x _IS_ beta.  There has never been a "released" 2.x fvwm.

However, 2.1.x is even _more_ beta than the 2.0.x releases :).  We have
changed the development model drastically and are working hard towards a
firm, official 2.2 release of fvwm in the not-to-distant future.  The
2.1.x versions are like Linux 2.1.x kernels: they may break important
features so you should be prepared to back each one out if you need to.

No question, and exactly this point has been made by many (including me,
more than once) for the last 2 or more years.

That's why we changed the development model and so far it seems to be
working pretty well.  But it is different--hence the new numbering
scheme.

Hi,
 I am trying to build fvwm on solaris 2.7 and somehow it appears to me that 
the built is not complete. The "make install" does not copy sample.fvwmrc and 
other modules to proper directories. I tried to go to sample.fvwmrc directory 
and looked at Makefile and found that

NORMAL_INSTALL = :

and hence make install does not do anything.
Anyone has come across this? What am I missing? Any feedback will be 
appreciated. Please respond directly to akumar@fore.com.

Thanks
Arun

Define "proper directories"?  Note that modules install into a
completely different directory structure starting with the 2.1.x series,
which uses GNU autoconf with all that implies about directory structure,
from the 2.0.x series.

You should unset the ModulePath setting in your config file and allow it
to use the default.  If you need to reset ModulePath (add stuff to it,
for example), use the environment variable $FVWM_MODULEDIR to insert the
default path into the ModulePath setting where you want it.

If you think the modules didn't install at all, we'll need to see a
transcript of the "make install" command you invoked and what it
printed.

  ak> I tried to go to sample.fvwmrc directory and looked at Makefile

Yes, I don't believe the new installation installs any of the system
config files by default.  Not really sure what the right thing is, here.

xclock has a seconds hand when invoked with 'xclock -update 1'.

I use xosview which has both, though not as a history graph. But
it's probably not what you are looking for since it should be at
least about 50x150 pixels (with a very small font).

asclock is a clock as well as a calendar (digital though and without
seconds). Asclock can launch an application for you, but you can bind
a mouse click to any button in FvwmButtons, even with a swallowed
window (there's something about this in the FAQ I think).

You can't have an iconified window in the button bar (except by
swallowing some kind of icon manager).

 I think it would be useful to have some reference to this situation on
the FVWM web pages, as well as a direct link to the 2.0.46 source. Call
it the 'stable beta' if you want to, or something.

 Right now someone going to the FVWM web pages is likely going to leave
with the impression that his or her choice is an ancient fvwm1 or an
unstable beta series. I don't think that this is a desirable state of
things.

This would be a good thing.  I've been using fvwm2 for a couple of years, 
upgrading as new versions were advertized, and I've subscribed to this 
list for a month or so now, and this is the first I've ever heard of what 
this numbering scheme means!  I know these are betas, but the meaning of 
"beta" has degraded in my mind to mean "reasonably stable release, but 
don't be too surprised about weird problems," mostly because of software 
like fvwm2 and many others that seem to have never-ending beta cycles.  
I'm not complaining (when I stray and try other window managers, I always 
come back to fvwm2; why go out when the milk's free at home), but this 
was news to me.

A little expectation-setting on the main web page would probably be a 
good thing.  Even better, though maybe more trouble than it's worth, 
would be a recommended stable release that gets updated as releases get 
some exposure to the people.

Side pixmaps are in the current 2.1.x series.  Download 2.1.4
if interested.

AddToFunction DriveOfficeMateCrazy "I" Exec exec audioplay MenuNoise.au
AddToFunction DriveOfficeMateCrazy "I" Popup MyMenu

"MyMenu" could be $0, MenuNoise.au could be $1.
Totally untested, but should give you the idea...

It's already in there, in the latest betas.  It'll be in the 2.2
release, which should be out "soon" (really, though, we mean it this
time!)  The man page sez:

  AddToMenu menu-name [ menu-label action ]
     ...
       If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set  off  by  at
       signs  ("@"),  then  the  text between them is expected to be the
       name of an xpm or bitmap file to draw along the left side of  the
       menu (a "side pixmap").  For example

            AddToMenu "StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@"

       creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner.

Please be aware that the 2.1.x betas aren't "semi-betas", like the 2.0.x
ones were, which are closer to releases.  They're _really_ betas!  For
example, we know there is a keybinding problem in the current 2.1.7
beta.  It will be fixed in the next release.

  rw> Also, how 'bout sound binding for menus in FvwmAudio??

Don't know about this.  I don't think modules can interact with menus
like that... but I'm surely no expert.

Note that FvwmAudio is becoming obsolete; use FvwmEvent instead.

Good input. Although you still might need the old syntax if
you want to be able to have a single menu look differently

The WindowList always uses the '*' menu style. With above
enhancement you could give it the side pixmap via the default
style.

Ark, I'm so dumb. That's this idiotic bug that breaks mouse bindings on
the client portion of a window. Sorry for molesting you with all these
questions. The reply with the 'M' versus '1' fooled me. It is fixed in
the CVS tree.

But I'm sure you had. This was already in 2.0.46 and probably a
lot versions before that. The problem is that WindowId needs a
window to operate on and then ignores it completely.

To the folks on the workers list:

The problem lies in parse.h. WindowId is listed in the section with
functions that need a window. As are lots of other functions I don't
believe that should be there:

    F_SEND_STRING,
    F_ADD_MOD,
    F_DESTROY_MOD,
    F_ECHO,
    F_BORDERSTYLE,
    F_WINDOWID,
    F_ADD_BUTTON_STYLE,
    F_ADD_TITLE_STYLE,
    F_ADD_DECOR,
    F_DESTROY_DECOR,
    F_UPDATE_DECOR,
    F_COLOR_LIMIT,

At least these functions have the FUNC_NO_WINDOW attribute set in functions.c.
I think we shouldn't use column 3 in the functions table to check if a
function needs a window at all. Colums four should suffice. The big question
is: will fvwm continue to work if I change that now (complec.c)?

And of course you can have it a bit easier with the CVS source

You say you have done some Linux programming. Are there any freeware GUI
Builders for Linux.  The thought of attempting to build a GUI app
programmagically horrifies me!!!!  Of course, it would be good practice.    Is
doing this under Linux C++ much of a chore if there aren't any such apps?

thanks.

This is the first time I've written to this mail list, so I'd like to
begin by thanking EVERYONE who's contributed to make Fvwm2 "The Best"
window manager available that I've been able to find. And I've tried as
many as I could. Fvwm2 is the ONLY win manager that's practical on my
old 486dx33 linux box! It's relatively fast, lean and easy to use!

That having been said, I'd also like to say I've been mainly running
2.0.43b but recently upgraded to 2.1.4 then 2.1.5, and now 2.1.7!
Beautiful! It all works!
No problems so far that couldn't be sorted out by modifying the syntax
of the .rc  except that DestroyModuleConfig doesn't seem to work for
FvwmButtons but DOES for FvwmButt*, and DOESN'T for FvwmEven* but DOES
for FvwmEv*.  Go figure!
I 'especially' like the new MenuStyle options and discovered by accident
how to set WindowList a new font style!
My question is this....
I've played about with various cursor styles... and an animated cursor
proggy I found somewhere.... but nowhere in any of the documentation
I've read, is there a mention of root window context! The man page
refers to the cursor in windows and/or decorations, but I need to
restore the normal "X" cursor and nothing I've tried works except
restarting fvwm2.  :( There's probably a 'trick' to it I don't
understand.

"DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*" would also work.  This is the
way the command is meant to be used.

As  you have found,  fvwm  does not control    the cursor on the  root
window.  This lets programs like "xaniroc" do their thing.

Somehow, I have a feeling I am missing the point you are trying to
make, I don't understand 'restore the normal "X" cursor'.
If you started a cursor animation program, you would have to stop
it to get back the the normal "X" cursor on the root window.

Hi

Firstly, sorry 'bout the multiple identical posts last time.  Had a bit
of a Netscape problem...  Thanks to Dominik Vogt; speedy service ;-)

This would, IMHO, be pretty tricky to implement.  It would be fun to be
able to resize the borders and handles individually (as in TOP, LEFT,
BOTTOMRIGHT, etc.), giving you the ability to emulate GNUStep-like
window managers with (say) the following:
	
	BorderStyle TOP Width 0
	BorderStyle LEFT Width 0
	BorderStyle RIGHT Width 0
	BorderStyle BOTTOM Width 10
	
	HandleStyle TOPLEFT Width 0
	HandleStyle TOPRIGHT Width 0
	HandleStyle BOTTOMLEFT Width 10
	HandleStyle BOTTOMRIGHT Width 10

With only the bottom border and bottom handles visible.  Admittedly,
this is far-fetched, and perhaps a bit of a major code rewrite this
close to the 2.2.0 release (I hope...;-)  Perhaps a "Style" option, to
customize individual windows?  All things considered, this may bloat
fvwm's size unacceptably, but it would make the window manager a _bit_
more customizable.

Anyway, if it's improbable (once you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains... Yeah, we got it), just ignore this.

Have a nice one

: This would, IMHO, be pretty tricky to implement.  It would be fun to be
: able to resize the borders and handles individually (as in TOP, LEFT,
: BOTTOMRIGHT, etc.), giving you the ability to emulate GNUStep-like
: window managers with (say) the following:

for that matter, it'd be cool if you could make the corner handles a different 
width than the side handles.

another cool thing would be to allow the title bar to sit on whatever side of 
the window you wanted it to, and perhaps even be a different width than the 
window, so you could have beOS style title "tabs".

just my $.02...

there are several IDE's to choose from. The one I know about is "OnyX" ..
builds on Xclass, I believe it can be found at www.iconlabs.net ... also,
you can download it from ftp.foxproject.org/pub/fOX/projects/devel for
version OnyX-0.3.0 and you'll want the latest stable version of Xclass in
/pub/xclass (don't get any of the cvs releases).

	Changing the root window cursor is really external to FVWM.
You can do it with xsetroot. Here's an example snipped from my 
.fvwm2rc (the cursor names are found in cursorfont.h, wherever fine
X headers are sold):

AddToMenu  SetCursor "Set Root Cursor"   Title
+          "Default X"         Exec exec xsetroot -cursor_name X_cursor
+          "Sailboat"          Exec exec xsetroot -cursor_name sailboat

    I'm running Fvwm2.0.46 here.

    You've probably got xsetroot on your machine - I've added a cursor
reset and background color reset command to my root window menu:

etc......
D'uh! How silly of me! Of course!

Many thanks!  :)

Hello,

Is there a fvwm2.exe...a port of Fvwm2 to Windows95? If not, can I
simply use Cygwin to compile the source tarball on Windows95? Any
experiences appreciated.

I am running Netmanage Unixlink X server on my Windows95 PC and
running my Unix (Solaris 2.6) fvwm2 (2.0.46) over my 28.8 modem is
excruciatingly slow. So I was thinking that I could run fvwm2 locally
on my PC and reduce network traffic.

Thanks a bunch,
Vikas

If all you need is an Xterminal, Install Linux, Solaris x86, FreeBSD or

Perhaps you should have a look at glade, which is a GUI builder which
uses the GTK+ toolkit. there is also glade-- out there, which is supposed
to build C++ code. They are both part of the gnome project, actual versions
can be found on anoncvs.gnome.org in CVS. Snapshots should also be available
somewhere.

Where would I get them from? Do I need to compile the X libraries from
scratch on Win95? Sigh...

Well, my X server package (Netmanage UnixLink) came with a twm.exe
binary and it performs quite satisfactorily. Much better than running
a window manager on my Unix machine over my 28.8 modem where each
mouse click generates network traffic :(. Anyway, twm.exe is good
enough, but once you have tasted a virtual window manager, anything
else just aint the same!

No. I have already installed the complete RH5.1 on a partition of my
disk last year, but my wife also needs the computer as much as I do.
And until they port Quicken, Word, Lotus Notes, Excel, Access, etc,
etc to Linux, I can see lots of reboots in my future. No thanks. Give
me a X server, a local window manager and I am a happy clam.

Hm. Dunno anything about lbx, heard about it though. Thanks for the
tip.

All versions of fvwm2 so far have been in beta: it's important to know
the number (esp. if it's 2.0.x or 2.1.x) so we know if it's autoconf or
imake.

It's always important to provide the exact error message wherever
possible.  Small differences in wording may not seem significant to the
casual reader, but can be very instructive to those familiar with them.

For instance are you sure it said libXpm.so.3?  Most libXpm versions
I've seen are 4.x, not 3.x.

Anyway, this is usually caused by not having the runtime application
linked properly.

The most useful tool for these problems is "ldd".

Run this:

  $ ldd /usr/local/bin/fvwm2

(or wherever you installed it).  This will list all the shared libs that
fvwm2 wants to find.  Probably you'll see something about not being able
to find libXpm.so.

If so, it's a link problem.  Try adding a --with-xpm-library option to
the configure invocation for fvwm (run make distclean first).  If that
doesn't help, try setting the environment var LD_RUN_PATH to the right
directory to find libXpm.so before making fvwm.

If you have an old version of fvwm which works, you can use ldd on that
to see where it's getting _it's_ libXpm.

After having played with 2.1.7 for a while, the inconsistencies
in how various commands take their options began to annoy me.
The following changes would, in my opinion, make things cleaner
and simpler.

  Get rid of HighlightColor and specify HilightColorForeground
  and HilightColorBackground in Style commands.

  WindowFont should be part of the Style command as well.

  IconFont should be extended to a full IconStyle, with the
  default IconStyle inheriting the values that make sense for
  icons from the default Style unless they've been set explicitly.

  Where you're configuring the same thing, the option should be the
  same.  For example, there's no reason to have Foreground and
  Background in MenuStyle and ForeColor and BackColor in Style.

I am running fvwm2.exe on Cygnus B20.1/Windows NT4. When I try to run
any module, I get the error:

[Fvwm][executeModule]: <<ERROR>>: No such module 'Send_configinfo' in
module path '/usr/X11R6.4/lib/X11/fvwm2'

What is this module? Some kind of bootstrap? I dont have it on Unix.
Is it needed only for Cygnus? Could some kind soul please help me in
tracking this down?

Please cc me on any replies, as I am not subscribed to the list.

Thanks a lot,

"Send_configinfo" is a command that modules can send to fvwm2.
(It is not a module, thats just what fvwm2 does with commands
it doesn't recognize.)

I have no idea what "fvwm2.exe" is.  I also don't know what
"Cygnus B20.1/Windows NT4" is.

Sorry for overloading this post with 3 issues.
I am using FVWM 2.1.7 on a Sun running Solaris 2.5.1.

1. When I run the FvwmTaskBar module,  *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly doesn't
   work (although it does in Fvwm95 if I run that).  Is there a bug in
   the code, or is it in my configuration somewhere?

2. I have been trying to activate a menu from a FvwmButtons button in
   such a way as to look a little like a "panel".  That means
   positioning the menu specifically relative to the button - without
   having to know exactly where the button is or the exact size of the
   menu.  I want it to sit just above the button in the same way a
   panel does.
   I spent some time playing with the position options to the Menu
   command, but could not get it to work.  Does anyone have any advice?

3. For a future version of FVWM2, would it be possible to add extra
   switches to the command line to enable parameters to be passed to the
   .fvwmrc file to be used in a similar fashion to parameters in FVWM
   functions (eg. fvwm2 -p1 abc -p2 def ... -p9 "Last Parameter").
   This could allow, for example, the default decor to be selected from
   the command line.


Brian.

Why should it? The hilighting colour is definitely a global
setting. Why should it be a window style?

Again I don't understand what what the benefit would be. Looking
through the manpage I see not settings at all that would make
sense passing from a window style to an icon style. There are
only two things configurable to icons (apart from the font):
If it goes into the icon box and if it has a title.

I don't think we should start wasting space just for the sake
of parsing consistency. In my eyes neither the fonts nor the
hilight colors are global settings.

Yup.

I know, that's one of the issues I wanted to address in my patch
and never found the time to address. The best you can get is this:

  *FvwmButtons(Title "Modules", Action `Menu ModuleMenu mouse c+5p -8p`)

This places the menu a few pixels above the mouse pointer. If
your buttons are small you can hardly tell the difference
between a placement relative to the button.

Did you compile it yourself or did you get a binary distribution?
In the first case we need to know which version you have, in the
second case I think you should contact the person who compiled it.

Sounds like a screwed up build.

Then consider yourself lucky. The CygWin toolkit is a UNIX to
NT porting environment. It tries to emulate UNIX on an NT
machine but with questionable success (even after 20 betas ;-) ).
fvwm2.exe is the result of compiling fvwm with the CygWin
toolkit on NT. I'm rather surprised that it works at all.
I use it myself at work but often wonder if it is worth all
the effort (after spending nearly a week to configure it it
still has a myriad of problems).

Hi,

Where can I get directions as to how to make fvwm executables.
I have downloaded the tar.gz package. I have run configure shell
script. Initially it gave me an error saying "ar" not found. Then
replaced "ar" with "ld -o", since it is a linker used in our environment.

I get this error. What should I do ? I have enclosed here the error I get.
Can you help. Pointing me at the related docs will also be helpful.

No.
ar is the archiver; it's used to build libraries.
ld is the linker; it's used to build executables.
You can't replace one with the other.

You have to find the ar program on your system.  You cannot build fvwm
without ar.

Please always remember to include information about what operating
system you are using.  Without this info we cannot tell you where to
look.

Normally ar is found by default in /bin or similar.  Some "modern"
operating system, such as Solaris, have decided in their infinite wisdom
to move these tools.  If you have Solaris, for example, you might try
adding /usr/ccs/bin to your PATH before running configure.

Odd as it may seem, Xpm is not part of standard X.

Look in /usr/X11R6/lib and see if libXpm.* is there.  If not, find the
Xpm rpm and install it.  If so, something else is wrong (maybe you have
an old version of Xpm?).  Send us the output of the config.log test for
xpm (search for xpm in config.log and send us the contents around that

Has there ever been any discussion about automating the selection of a 
MiniIcon value based on the Icon setting?

What I'm suggesting is something like a global "MiniIconPrefix"
setting that would calculate a MiniIcon file name by appending the set 
prefix to whatever the Icon value is for a given Style.

This would ease the use of KDE-style icon directories, where there is 
a "/mini" subdirectory within the pixmap directory that contains small 
versions of each image. It also would work for those, like me, who
keep their mini-icons in the same directory as their pixmaps, but with 
"mini." tagged to the begining of the filename.

Of course, this can also be done by preprocessing the .fvwm2rc (and
MiniIcon accepts values like "mini/myicon.xpm", interestingly
enough).

I'm willing to try my (somewhat shakey) hand at a patch, if there's
enough interest.

I have /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.10  and  libXpm.so.4 (sym link to
first lib) so I don't know why it is failing.  I'm doing everything as
root so it is not a permissions issue.  

Here is the output from config.log I think you are talking about :

configure:2769: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   -L/usr/X11R6/lib conftest.c
-lICE   1>&5
configure:2832: checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm
configure:2851: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   conftest.c -lXpm -lXpm 
-L/usr/X11R6/lib  -lSM -lICE -lX11   1>&5
ld: cannot open -lXpm: No such file or directory
configure: failed program was:
#line 2840 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char XpmReadFileToXpmImage();
int main() {
XpmReadFileToXpmImage()

What does that buy you which cannot be done with -cmd Read

  I'd disagree with that, personally. If one's specified wholly distinct
decors for various windows, it makes a great deal of sense [to me] to have
the window highlight itself within the bounds of its own decor. It's one
of the first things I noticed when setting up fvwm2 for the first time ...

  Yes, I don't see enough icon-specific settings to warrant a new command.
IIRC, one can include icon settings in decors [I may be wrong!], and one
can certainly apply them on a window/app. class basis. Maybe if the future
if more icon-control settings are added, it'd make sense.

  ?  You just said that you thought the highlight colour /is/ a global
setting.

  Do you not have a libXpm.a in the same place? I'm not sure how ld works
at that level; it may need the lib.a to reference symbols on the .so (?) 
I'd never assumed that to be the case, but if you're having problems, that
may be it.

  If your system has 'truss', and you're still having problems, try a
'truss -f -topen <compile-command>' to find out what file-open [and hence
filename] command is failing - I've assumed it's "libXpm.a" [from '-lXpm']
above.

So, has anyone ever complained about that? I think there are far
more important enhancements in usability to make than this. For
me it falls into the same category as specifying your own shadow
and hilighting colours (i.e. superfluous bloat).

I still can't see what these icon specific settings could be.

  Actually ... :-)

  I only say /that/ since my hi/lolight colours come out a shite shade of
green, when all my window borders are blue hues - but I've become used to
it.

  On the HilightColors front, it's not actually a problem for me, since I
prefer a consistent look any way - all my windows use the same (well,
pretty well) decor. I think one has to be a little twisted to want
different window colours on different windows :-)


  On that note - I've implemented a 'changing' toggle-size button by
defining two similar decors: each the same, bar the icon for the
toggle-size button (one's a toggle-big piccy, one's a toggle-back piccy).
my toggle-size func. sets the decor of the current window accordingly.

  It works a treat, but I can't help feeling that there's an easier way to
do it. Any suggestions?


> I still can't see what these icon specific settings could be.

  Font, f/g & b/g colour, box, etc. I think it comes down to being more of
an 'IconDecor' that IconStyle ... or even, just have then icon bits in a
Decor, and be able to create super-classes of Decor (i.e., Decor MyDecor
UseDecor MyWindowDecor, UseDecor MyIconDecor' ... and chaning a sub-decor
changes the parent). Or can we already do that?

Yes, that's it.  Extremely strange.  I'm going to go with an initial
opinion that something in your system config is messed up :)

Try this; create a foo.c:

 char XpmReadFileToXpmImage();
 int main() { XpmReadFileToXpmImage(); return 0; }

Now run the compile with the -v option:

  $ gcc -v -o foo -g -O2 foo.c -lXpm -lXpm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lSM -lICE -lX11

and tell us what it prints.  Check where it is looking for things for
any oddities.  Although this absolutely shouldn't make any difference,
try rearranging things to look a little more "normal":

  $ gcc -v -o foo -g -O2 foo.c -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm -lSM -lICE -lX11

Does that work better?  I hope not, because if it does I'm not sure what
to do about it :-/.

There should be a libXpm.so somewhere in this picture.

Normally the symbolic link would look like:

MyMachine> ls -l /opt/public/lib/libXpm*
lrwxrwxrwx   /opt/public/lib/libXpm.so@ -> libXpm.so.4.10
-rw-r--r--   /opt/public/lib/libXpm.so.4.10

If there is no file, "libXpm.so", I think the rest of the bug
report falls into place.

Dominik	

I disagree. If I say something like this:

  Style "Emacs"		Color White/Green
  Style "XTerm"		Color White/Blue

it is very reasonable for me to want to also say:

  Style "Emacs"		HilightColor White/LightGreen
  Style "XTerm"		HilightColor White/LightBlue

I also think this is what an awful lot of people expect to work, and they
struggle for a while with the fact that they can set colors on a per
window basis, but not highlight colors.

I don't see why the font shouldn't be settable per window, though I have
less strong feelings about this.

I've not thought about the icon stuff.

I agree with this completely. If you allow different colour settings on a
per-window/class basis then you should also allow highlight colours on a
per-window/class basis. It makes sense (To me at least ...)

But what's wrong with appending the mini subdir into your pixmap path?
I only import my system's /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps, but I
override builtins by prepending $HOME/pixmaps in my pixmap path. The
mini-* effect is, IMHO, far more annoying and more begs for the patch
you mention, but all the same, I think the general view here is that
there are better ways to approach that "problem" than by hacking fvwm
to do something that a good preprocessor would handle...

	Or better yet, make a symlink (preferrably in /usr/local/bin)
to /usr/ccs/bin/ar, or wherever the vendor has hidden it.

	If you're using Solaris, I think you'll find that Sun did
install a man page for ar (actually, I believe there are 2 versions),
giving you the full path to the binary.

  What version of fvwm?


  Under fvwm2 [all I've tried], having (e.g.):

Netscape.MailThread.geometry:   643x690+426+140
Netscape.Composition.geometry:  540x799+10+10
Netscape.Navigator.geometry:    758x735+10+10

  ... in my app-defaults/Netscape works a treat.


  We do now know that, due a Netscape funny [not fvwm], you won't be able
to apply StartsIconic to Netscape - you have to use -iconic, and doing
this on pre 2.1.7 stopped StartsOnPage working, but I think that's all
fixed now. *I* don't have any problems any more.

Put simply Netscape doesn't like being told where to put itself. It's
not a window manager bug, but a Netscape "feature". You can solve it by
putting something in your X resources file, but I'm afraid I don't know
what. It should be in the archive though ...

Hi,=20
    I was looking through the code for the module FvwmTaskBar, and I see =
that the menu for
the taskbar is created in the .fvwm2rc file, and is activated by the =
module sending a message
to fvwm.  I was wondering if menus could be made to be dynamic?  For =
example, suppose I had
a Popup defined in my .fvwm2rc as:

Popup foo {
         "bar" Exec nop
}

Could I have a module "Read" a file that would redefine the foo Popup =
such that the
entries and the actions change such as:
Popup foo {
         "fum" Exec ls
}
Or must I always restart fvwm2?  Thanks.

Your friends are AddToMenu, DestroyMenu, and Read.

But, of course, your best friend is "man fvwm2".

Your best friend wishes you would look him up.

  Hmm. Not quite, if he's after what I tried to do. I wanted to emulate
olvwm's DIRLIST submenu option, which hangs a submenu off an entry that's
created on the fly (in this case, the contents of a directory).

  Now, I've done something /similar/ by writing a script DirMenu that
recreates a menu '_DirMenu' & 'Popup's it when it's called, which is with
something like:

+ "List Dir" Read 'DirMenu /some/where'

  Although this works, 'List Dir' is a terminating menu entry (i.e., no
submenu) - I have to actually select it, lose the current menu-tree, then
have the _DirMenu popup.

  What I think Mr. Straub was after was what I was trying for: a /dynamic/
submenu. I couldn't see a way to implement this (from 'man fvwm2'), but
may have missed somthing.

  And if that's /not/ what he was on about, then sorry for hijacking the
thread!

I am running fvwm on SunOS 4.1.4 fvwm and would like to configure it to use dual screen (i.e. /dev/cgsix0 and /dev/cgsix1 in Sun terminolgies). Is there any way to do it.

Thanks

Douglas,

Here is a little script I use on Solaris system to start up FVWM on a two
headed system, it was originally used on a SunOS 4.1.4 system, YMMV.

xinit -- /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun -dev /dev/cgsix0 -dev /dev/cgsix1 -lf 0

I put the script in ~/bin/xstart

The fvwm2 man page says: during initialisation fvwm2 searches for
.fvwm2rc configuration file in the home dir ectory of the user, if
doesn't find, then in /usr/lib/X11/fvwm. If can't find any of tehm,
fvwm2 will be "basically useless". Now, I've got none of them, my fvwm2
still works pretty well. How is it possible?

(Assuming you have a Linux distribution): Sone distributors hack
in their own paths instead of /usr/lib/X11/fvwm. The file might
have another name too.

As Michael Han hinted at, but I don't think explicitly stated,
if fvwm2 can't find the .fvwm2rc in the 2 places it looks, it
then looks for system.fvwmrc.

It may work "pretty well" that way, but  I would expect that you would
not want to leave it that way.

The system.fvwmrc stuff is documented in the installation instructions.
If the installer does his thing to the system.fvwmrc, fvwm2 could work
"very well" that way.

Hrmm, your description seems pretty accurate, regardless of whether
the original questioner was asking this in specific or not... I've
bumped into the same thing, writing silly little hacks in fvwmperl. I
really overload my fvwm menus. Given that Functions and Menus are
stored identically in fvwm2, it now occurs to me that there might be a
way to sneak functions into a menu invocation somehow.

Anyhow, I usually do this when I want to do a dynamic menu:

AddToFunc	DynamicMenuFunctionFoo	I	PipeRead foo

Where foo is responsible for returning a DestroyMenu, AddToMenu, PopUp
stream. Then I can do a:

AddToMenu	DynamicMenuParent	"a dynamic menu" DynamicMenuFunctionFoo

I think I see a way to maybe do this and keep the dynamic menu as part
of the menu tree...

This thing?

If this  thing is some release of  fvwm,  after you have  unpacked the
distribution I think you  will find a file in  the top level directory
with some instructions.

Always tell us the release.  It makes a difference.

The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the fourth official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.10). Available at

  http://www.fvwm.org/

it includes the following features (entries with '+' are new in
this beta):

+) Some tricky bugfixes.
*) New syntax for menu styles (MenuStyle) with greatly improved
   configurability (the SetMenuStyle command from previous betas
   has been merged into MenuStyle, please make sure to change
   your .fvwm2rc on that).
*) The growing windows bug from the last betas has been fixed
   (if you see it again, please contact fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu).
*) AutoHide bugfixes for FvwmTaskBar (EdgeThickness command).
*) New commands DefaultFont, DefaultColors and Emulate. The
   SetMenuDelay command from the previous betas has been removed.
*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug tracking
   system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour with WindowList
   command.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).
*) Mini title windows for FvwmPager (aka Balloons).
*) FvwmEvent is the successor of FvwmAudio. FvwmAudio is still
   available.
*) FvwmTile and FvwmCascade modules were replaced by
   FvwmRearrange. Shells for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade provide
   backward compatibility.
*) Improved FvwmButtons button placement to give absolute control
   over where the buttons are placed.
*) Color limiting (previously available thru patches).
*) Multiple Icon Boxes, Icon box grids, and Icon box fill
   direction control (previously available thru patches).
*) Faster startup.
*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability.
*) Many small enhancements too numerous to list here.
*) Consistent copying policy.
*) GNU autoconf support.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be
found at:

  http://www.fvwm.org/NEWS.html

Although the maintainers feel this beta is quite stable there are
some known problems that shall be fixed before the final release
(and some that will have to wait). You can find a list of known
bugs in the BUGS file at the top level of the distribution.

Before you report a bug, please read the manpages, the NEWS file
and the FAQ too. If you can solve your problem this way but still
feel the information was too hard to find, please tell us.

To submit a bug, please follow the link to the FVWM bug tracking
system on our web page.


Beta testers needed urgently:
=============================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.

I was curious about support for D&D on fvwm2.  I saw that FvwmWharf supports
the OffiX protocol.   On the linux-announcements awhile ago there was an
announcement of the standardization of D&D on X.  I believe the
specification for the protocol is at http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~jafl/xdnd.

What's interesting about it is that the toolkits Gtk+,Qt, and most
importantly to me, Xemacs, will be supporting the protocol.  They have a
sample implementation that looks pretty easy to modify.

Does Fvwm have a D&D protocol?  Are there any plans to implement one?
Thanks,

Doug

You are indeed correct.  AddToMenu, DestroyMenu, and Read are my friends.

>But, of course, your best friend is "man fvwm2".
Hmm, I couldn't find anywhere in the man page where it says that the menus
cans
be dynamic.  On the other hand, it doesn't they are static...

What would FVWM do with a D&D protocol?

If useful things can be done with it, I think that in the future FVWM
would be happy to support linking with Xdnd (I agree that appears to be
the forming basic standard protocol) if available.

The only place I can think it might be useful, offhand, is in some of
the modules like FvwmButtons or possibly FvwmPager.  It would be nice, I
suppose, if you could configure FvwmButtons to handle various types of
dropped items in different ways.

I can think of three additional module examples:

- it would be nice if you could install a handler for root window
  drops; perhaps this could be a module. Some might consider this 
  bloat...

- it would also be nice if FvwmIconMan would pass drop events to
  iconified applications (although I wonder if the proposed protocol
  would allow this..)

- It would be a neat hack for FvwmIconMan to support D&D between
  managers, in cases where there are multiple managers defined. This
  would allow dragging iconified windows from one manager to another,
  for example. 

Regarding FvwmWharf, is this being actively maintained by anyone? I've 
been using it since before 2.0.46, as I like the way it works. From
what I can see in 2.1.7, most of what I want in a Wharf can be done
with FvwmButtons, albeit with a different (and perhaps more difficult) 
configuration syntax. I'm wondering if it's worth the effort to get my 
Wharf reimplemented based on FvwmButtons.

If anyone out there has managed to successfully get FvwmWharf to work
with the OffiX D&D support compiled in, I'd appreciate it you would
email me (not the list) your *FvwmWharf section from .fvwm2rc. I can
get the module to compile with D&D turned on, but I get all kinds of
weird behavior when I actually use it.

Finally, and this is off-topic, can someone who understands the
concept explain to me (not the list) what it means for an application
to be "dockable" in the context of WindowMaker, and whether it is
feasible and/or desirable for either FvwmWharf, FvwmButtons, or
FvwmIconMan to support that same
concept/protocol/whatever-you-call-it?

I have a requirement to automatically exit fvwm when an application is
closed and have been unable to determine how this could be accomplished.  If
someone coould provide me with some pointers it would be greatly appreciated.

The situation is that I use xdm to provide the login and then, through the
m4 series of scripts provided with the Red Hat distribution and heavily
modified, kick off the execution of an expect script which provides a GUI
front end to a process control.  The reason for the heavy modifications is
that the user is limited to this application and cannot get into anything
else.  With all this, everything works fine except that when the expect
script is done, the user is required to specifically select 'Start' and
'Exit FVWM'.

Again, thanks for any pointers...

Dave

Why not make the .xsession like this

fvwm2 &
yourapp

Thus you application would control the session; when it was done
the session would end and a new xdm login would start.

The subject line says it all. linux kernel 2.1.125, 2.2.0pre4, and 2.2.0pre9
(a.k.a 2.2.0-final) will not allow FvwmCommandS to load. It gives a
"FvwmCommandS: dead pipe" error.

I posted this on linux-kernel but got no response. Has anyone gotten
FvwmCommandS to work on the latest kernels, and if so, how?

That wouldn't work on my NCD XServer as it posts a dialog asking
whether to kill lingering clients.  A more resilient approach for
handling background tasks in an X session is

    bpid=

    fvwm2 &
    bpid="$! $bpid"

    xclock &
    bpid="$! $bpid"

    yourapp

    for p in $bpid
    do
        kill $p
    done

The last loop may work as "kill $bpid" but some versions of kill are
limited in the number of process ids they accept.

Yes.

You need to install the Xpm package, including the headers and
library.

If you want to compile FVWM with pixmap support, you need to obtain the
Xpm library and install it (which will give you the xpm.h header, too).

You can get Xpm from ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/ somewhere (I forget exactly).

Or, modify the configuration of your fvwm and disable pixmap support.

I have the following line somewhere in my fvwmrc file:

Mouse 2         R       A       WindowList NoGeometry NoDeskSort
Transient

Each time I pop up some window, WindowList shows it apart from the rest,
just like it is placed on a different desk. Only after it has had the
focus, WindowList moves the entry to the right group in it's menu.

I had it in 2.1.7, and it seems it hasn't changed in 2.1.10. A bug or is
there some good reason to work like that?

Off topic: Is it much work to be Gnome aware in fvwm2? I know there are
other people working on it but their development isn't going fast and if
you include MWM hints, why not Gnome? This is not a blame at all,
because for the time being, fvwm2 is still my favorite WM, it would just
be even wonderful if that got incorporated.

Kind greetings,

Wing Tung

Using both NoGeometry and NoDeskSort may lead to confusion.  I put the
separators in to show different desks but using NoGeometry means you
can't tell what desk a window is in so the separators look arbitrary.
Using NoDeskSort means you get the windowlist in the order that fvwm
maintains it. New windows are added to the end of the list and the
currently focussed window is at the start of the list.  You're right it
does look a bit odd if you have NoGeometry. I'll add a bug report (it
won't be fixed before 2.2).  Try not using NoGeometry and it might be
clearer. This did change recently, it was so we could have reliable
alt-tab behaviour.

The Gnome hints will probably make it in some time after 2.2. They are
not very well documented and are probably subject to change. There is no
point chasing a headless chicken ;-)

Someone associated with the GNOME group is doing this now.  His patches
will be incorporated sometime post-2.2.

In the meantime you could probably contact him and get the patches when
he's ready to release them; he'd probably like to have someone test them
out.

Check the email archives for more details.

Hello,

Is it possible to bind an action to a "windows" or "menu" key like
those that comes with standard 104-key keyboards (these keys are not
found on traditional Unix keyboards).

Thanks,

Sure!  Just use your .xmodmaprc file and run it through xmodmap in your
~/.xinitrc or equivalent file, i.e.,

	xmodmap -e ~/.xmodmaprc

where .xmodmaprc has something like this:

! Assign left Win95 key to L5 (Raise/Lower in fvwm2)
keycode 115 = L5
! Assign right Win95 key to Compose Character
keycode 116 = Multi_key
! Assign right "menu" key to L7 (Iconify in fvwm2)
keycode 117 = L7

In my example, you can then assign L5/L7 to actions in your .fvwm2rc file.

This may be solution but I have not tried it completely, so I can't say it
works for sure.

Using xev you can find the keycode that corresponds to pressing the "windows"
or "menu" key(s). You can then use xmodmap to map that key to some other
keypress, an unused function key, for example. 

If you have trouble doing the xmodmap by hand, xkeycaps is a useful tool
for generating maps to be used by xmodmap. The latest version of xkeycaps is
available at http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/. 

You can then edit your .fvwmrc to map the (function) key to the desired
behavior. 

For example, xev tells me my "menu" key generates keycode 126. My .xmodmap
file contains the line:

keycode 0x7E =  Control_L

(Note 126 (decimal) equals 0x7E (hex)). 

Hope this helps.

Unable to click anywhere in window to raise (w/o setting Click to Focus)
in fvwm1 is driving me nuts.  I guess this is possible in fvwm2.  But I'm
having trouble compiling fvwm-2.1.7 on my Linux machine. 

"./configure --with-cxx=gcc"  seemed to work ok.

But I get the following error afterwards:

$ make
make  all-recursive

Am I missing some library?  Thanks for your help.

Many thanks to Kent for his suggestion.  Something simple like this helped
me get a fresh look at how fvwm works and how the m4 is built up on it.  I
was able to implement his suggestion in a few minutes and, after some
editing to eliminate the unwanted taskbar, pager, etc., got exactly what I
wanted.

The only question now is: Is there some way to get the password to echo
asterisks during entry?  Nothing important, one user expected it.

Thanks again!

Dave

The xdm xlogin widget won't echo anything during password entry
because it exposes the password's length.  I briefly checked the
xdm man page to see if there was an resource that could be set to
enable feedback on password entry but there doesn't appear to be.
You'd probably have to hack it into the source if you really
wanted it.

Ok, I'm sure this will show my ignorance of X servers, but I'll do my
best to make this intelligible.

I'm currently running fvwm 2.0.46 on Solaris 2.6, getting ready to go to
fvwm 2.1.x. Our Sparcs have 24-bit video cards in them, but the X server
is configured for applications to run in 8-bit mode by default.
Applications like ImageMagick and Netscape query the X server to figure
out the 24 bit support, and stat up in 24 bit mode. We can't change our
X server configuration to default to 24 bit because it breaks several of
our older design tools. So right now, fvwm starts up in 8 bit mode.

The question is - is 2.1.x able to query the X server to start in 24 bit
mode, or is there a quick change that can be made in the code to make it
default to 24 bit? Any chance of a feature being added here?


Thanks in advance,


Steve.

Try "locate Xatom.h".  Normally those files are in directory
"/usr/X11R6/include/X11/".  If you do not have those files, you have
not probably installed package for X-developement.  If you are using
Debian, the needed package is xlib6g-dev.  Other distributions
probably have a similar package.

Try starting X with "startx -bpp 24".  If you have 24bit screens defined in
you XF86Config file, this should work.

Hello,

Sorry for the intrusion into your mailing list but I thought it stupid
to submit a new bug when one exists.  I'm experiencing the exact problem
described in bug #9 in the "duplicate" list of bugs.  I'm running 
fvwm2-2.0.46 as configured with "AnotherLevel" from RedHat 5.1
distribution.
Is there a patch/new version which fixes this?

Please email me directly since I'm not part of this mailing list (nor do
I want to be -- I'm on enough mailing lists). 

TIA

PS: Don't bother flaming.  I know!  I know!  I know!


End of mailing list noise.

Fvwm and the modules use the default visual which is probably a good
guess as it should minimize the amount of colormap flashing when going
from clients to menus etc..  Is it possible to persuade you older apps
to use a non default visual? I take it that your server can run both 8
and 24 bit visuals but you have the 8 bit one as default. If you can get
the default visual to be 24 bit you could try a "*visualID: PseudoColor"
in your .Xdefaults.  If you older apps are Motif they should pick this
up.

It is possible to hack fvwm to default to a non-default visual.  I guess
it would not be too bad for just fvwm but the modules should use the
same setting and that would involve changing all the modules.  Any
modules that swallow other clients would have big problems trying to
swallow clients with different depths and this would be more likely to
happen if the modules used a non-default visual.

Cheers,
Tim.

It's fixed in the latest betas.  See the FVWM web page for info on
retrieving this version.

Note it's a beta, so while it doesn't have this problem it might well
have other problems...

Umm.. he's already running with a 24 bit visual, but 8 bit as _default_
visual.. And Solaris' Xserver doesn't care much for XFree86 specific
options or config-files...

The question was how to make fvwm pick the 24bpp visual instead of the
8bpp [default] visual..

No, I'm not sure this is really fixed. We did some work on
the signal handlers that *may* have fixed it but maybe not.
The reason why this is in duplicates is that it was already
reported under another title. Unfortunately I entered this
report in the first days of Jitterbug where we were not
sure how to work with it so there is no reference of *which*
bug it's a duplicate. I'd start looking in 'confirmed'.

Thanks for the advice, Teemu.  Installing the X-devel. package fix the
problem. =20

One more question:

Why can't FVWM find the installed xpm libraries and headers during
=2E/configure?

----------
I used the following command:

=2E/configure --with-cxx=3Dgcc --with-xpm-library=3D/usr/X11R6/lib=20
--with-xpm-includes=3D/usr/X11R6/include

-----------
My xpm files are located in:

/usr/X11R6/bin/sxpm
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/xpm.h
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4.8

----------
I get the following configuration info:

=2E..
=2E..
creating extras/FvwmWharf/Makefile
creating config.h
config.h is unchanged
Configuration:

  FVWM Version:             2.1.10

  Build extra modules?      no
  Have ReadLine support?    no
  Have RPlay support?       no
  Have XPM support?         no: Xpm library or header not found!

---------

Thanks again.  I tried to guess the correct .configure command from
reading the INSTALL.FVWM file but no luck.

Try removing the config.cache file.  It may be "remembering" a previously
failed attempt.

Heya all

 Compiled 2.1.10 on my solaris 2.5.1 machine. Using gcc.

Did it twice, the first time I used the Xpm3.4g. Worked fine.

 Then went and used Xpm3.4k. (I forgot I had it the first time)

Using....

./configure --prefix=/opt/fvwm --with-xpm-library=/opt/fvwm/lib
--with-xpm-includes=/opt/fvwm/include

With:

heckyl# pwd
/opt/fvwm
heckyl# ls -l lib

heckyl# ls -l include/X11
total 34
-r--r--r--   1 andrew   users      16644 Mar 19  1998 xpm.h

Got from Configure..

Check in your include path it is checking for the version given by the header you may have installed the library but not the header

Odd; usually configure will show some reason for not liking xpm here.

Well, first make sure you ran "make distclean", or "rm -f config.cache"
so it's not using any cached information.

If that still doesn't help, look in the config.log file and see where it
tries to compile and run the xpm app to find the version: what does it
say there?

That's right. I'm running both 8 and 24, but the 8 is the default. And I can't
run 24 as the default, because it breaks older applications (believe me, we've
tried). So that's why I need fvwm to start with 24. An Xresources option would be
nice, or just some code to autoselect.

Maybe it's time for me to remember how to code.... Geez, that's a scary thought.

It would have to be a command line option. Fvwm doesn't do Xresources
and auto selecting a non-defualt would probably cause problems for most
users. I counted a total of 33 CopyFromParent's in fvwm source and some
of these are probably what would need changing. It would be good too if
the modules could be told of the visual to use, that would mean a change
to the module protocol and recoding all the modules.

Cheers,
Tim.

Doh, Might be best for fvwm to set an env var $FVWM_VISUAL rather than
mess with the message protocol.

Sigh.  This crap has more lives than a cat!  A year ago, it appeared,
with a deadline date in Feb 1998.  The FCC put up a note on their web
site debunking it.  That note is still there.  They have another "Fact
Sheet" page, dated December 1998, categorically and in detail debunking
it again.  Please see
  <http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/nominute.html>
  <http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/ispfact.html>
for yourself.  And _please_ do what you can to eradicate this idiocy!

Sigh.  This crap has more lives than a cat!  A year ago, it appeared,
with a deadline date in Feb 1998.  The FCC put up a note on their web
site debunking it.  That note is still there.  They have another "Fact
Sheet" page, dated December 1998, categorically and in detail debunking
it again.  Please see

That says...

Still no clue.

Hi all,

 I need to put a banner which cannot be buried or moved on the top of my
screen. Auto-raising doesn't quite fit the bill -- having a window 
partially obscured by the banner is *very* annoying. Essentially, I'd
like
to be able to tell FVWM to reposition any window which tries to overlap
my banner.

 Is there any builtin way to do this, or do I need to write a module or
use FvwmCommand &  a script?? Thanks in advance!

I Installed latest FVWM2 on my little sparc - It's cool!!  CDE sucks!

One question: how do I set the time it waits before blanking out my screen?
(due to inactivity)

I don't know if it is a function of FVWM2 or my OS (Slowaris 2.6).

I searched FAQ's and such and couldn't find a thing!

It's not an FVWM2 issue, but a function of your X server.

Try:	man xset

This is an X server function, not a function of the window manager.

The simplest thing is to run something like: xset s [seconds] (see the
man page) from your .xinitrc or equivalent file.  Much better is to get
a real screensaver program, such as xscreensaver, and run that.

 All the windows in all my X window managers scroll too slow. I put,
xset m 8 1, in my
.xinitrc file, as someone told me to speed-up the scrolling , but this
did not work. What
else can I do to make the windows scroll faster.

How do I get a screensaver to turn on after a specified amout of time? I
can only start a
screensaver from the menu.

If you are using xlock for a screensaver look for a program called
xautolock

or look for a program called xscreensaver and set  
xscreensaver*timeout: <minutes>   in your .Xdefaults
and run xscreensaver at start.  (.xinitrc or whatever your startup is)

That's _it_?  No error message after that?  No link error?  Arg.

OK, try extracting the text there into a .c file and compiling it by
hand using the commands configure used:

  $ cat >foo.c
  #include <X11/xpm.h>
  int main(int c, char **v) {
    return c == 1 ? 0 :
      XpmIncludeVersion != XpmLibraryVersion() ? 1 :
      XpmIncludeVersion < 30406 ? 2 : 0 ;}
  ^D

  $ gcc -o conftest -g -O2  -I/opt/fvwm/include -I/usr/openwin/include foo.c -L/opt/fvwm/lib -lXpm -L/usr/openwin/lib -R/usr/openwin/lib  -lX11 -lsocket  -lnsl

Do you get any compiler or linker errors?  Next try:

  $ ./conftest
  $ echo $?

(assuming Bourne shells; I guess you'd use $status in C shells?)

What is the return code for the program?

Ok, Got a little luck here, sort of.

 Compiled with no problem or errors. When I tried to run it i got.

# ./conftest    
ld.so.1: ./conftest: fatal: libXpm.so.4.11: can't open file: errno=2
Killed

Check the obvious permission errors. All fine. check the file type.

libXpm.so.4.11: ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC Version 1, dynamically
linked, not stripped

Looks ok.

For S**ts and giggles I checked the 3.4g that I had been using. Noticed
that it didnt have the shared versions, only the straight ar archive. So I
got rid of the shared libraries and only left the unshared libXpm.a in
place.

 Recompiled, reran conftest. Works. Tried configure again. Works. 

So, for some reason, something doesnt like the shared libraries. But That
doesnt bother me, as I would rather used the unshared, so I dont have to
worry about distributing a shared library as I install fvwm around here.

Thats what I get for using pre-compilied binaries of the libraries instead
of compiling them myself.

This means that, while the linker can find the shared lib just fine
because you specified -L, the runtime can't find it.  Note that there is
a distinction between linktime paths and runtime paths--older systems
like SunOS didn't make this distinction (or not easily), but newer ones
do.

This means that you don't have your ld.so environment set up correctly.
On Solaris, for example, you can specify the runtime path by either
setting the LD_RUN_PATH env. variable or the -R option at link time.  If
your xpm libraries are in a non-standard place, you _must_ provide one
or the other of these methods for finding it a runtime (or set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime).

Unfortunately, at this time GNU autoconf (and thus fvwm) doesn't handle
this situation very well :(.  We hope to improve this in the future (see
the BUGS file).  Until then, you'll have to do something like:

  $ LDFLAGS=-R/opt/fvwm/lib ./configure --prefix=/opt/fvwm ...

to explicitly set the -R option.

What really confuses me is why you didn't see this output (or any other
output) in the config.log file.  It should have been there...

Oh well.

I'm trying to get FvwmButtons (under fvwm-2.0.46) to swallow "xmoontool
-iconic" (which shows the phase of the moon as a 64x64 pixel image).
Unfortuantely, I can't get FvwmButtons to swallow the iconified version;
it just opens as an icon. As soon as I uniconify it, FvwmButtons sucks
it up (but because it is uniconified at this point, it is useless to have
in my button bar.)
