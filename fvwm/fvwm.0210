Not exactly I think. In what follow I assume that you have a screen
which supports only 256 colors (8 bit depth). Can you confirm this?

The point is that a new color limit method has been implemented for
such a screen. New colors tables are used so that it is possible to
use gradient in such screens (and use bg pixmap with a lot of close
colors in Colorset). One pb with these new tables is that they have
not enough grey (so the pb with the calc icon). This may be fixed in
the future. Also colors approximation formulae has changed and I am not
sure that the new one are so good. But remember that with a 8 bit depth
screen fvwm will never use true colors for icons but colors in a table
(and any reasonable app will do the same things with such screens, if
it has to display a lot of colors).

You can still use the "old" table by using the following option
-color-limit 61. Moreover, when the "old" table was build I think that
the (IMHO ugly, do you try wm-icons package :o) icons you use was used
for testing. Unfortunately, you can still have "pbs" because colors
approx was done in a different way (BTW, in two steps one by fvwm and
the other by the xpm lib). 

You may alos try to use dithering: use Colorset in your FvwmButtons:

Colorset 10 bg grey, fg white, ditherIcon

*FvwmButtons: Colorset 10
# remove the Back and Fore colors option
# ... your config

and start fvwm without the "-color-limit" option
(DitherIcon/NoDitherIcon are not dynamic, you should restart the
Buttons after a change).  BTW, ditherIcon is an undocumented Colorset
option because maybe it will be removed. Also, there are not enough
doc about the -color-limit option as the code is not finished.

You may also try to start fvwm with -color-limit 125 or 216.
But you will probably have pbs with certain apps you use
(or fix some pbs with some gtk apps).

Any feedback is really welcome.

Regards, Olivier

Hi...

I just tried logging in there and did Ctrl-Alt-Escape once the it had hung
and nothing happened.  I'm not sure what this key combination was intended
to do, but it had not effect.

By chance, I have found something that does let me log in cleanly every
time.  Bizarrely, and for no reason that I can think of, changing the window
manager startup timeout has an effect.  If I reduce the
Dtsession*waitWmTimeout in my .Xdefaults from 2 seconds to 1 second, the
login works every time.  Apparently when the Window Manager starts up almost
immediately it doesn't encounter the error.

I can't explain why this fixes the problem.  If anyone has an ideas, please
let me know.

Cheers,
Donald.

Hi.

I've been thinking about this one, and I just saw your newsgroup
post, so I figure you're getting anxious.

Does Ctrl-Alt-Escape help?

Hmm, I should have connected Solaris 9 and CDE, but on the Solaris
systems I've used, I disable the CDE login manager.

The FAQ doesn't include your symptom, but question 2.2 does
discuss starting Fvwm with CDE.

Here's the output of 'xdpyinfo'

I believe I have a raptor graphics card that is supposed to support alot
more than 256 colors, anyone know how to alter this setting (or to verify
that I'm capable of that) ?

I'll grab the "beautiful" wm-icons to see what you are talking about :-)
Are you saying that the icons there will not exhibit this problem (use
less gray ?) or simply that they look nicer ?

That looked horrid, so I opted for

  Colorset 10 bg grey59, fg white, ditherIcon

but that still showed the same problem (in both rcalc.xpm and clamp.xpm)

Well, in short I don't use gradients (as I see that its a nicety that I
can certainly live without), but I do expect to see my limited 8 icons
to be displayed correctly.  Maybe a 'EnableGradients on/off' might be
something you'd consider.

In any regard, I tried starting fvwm with '-color-limit 61' and that fixed
my icon problems :-).  Is there anyway I can put that option inside of my
.fvwm2rc file ?  Is there any reason why the "ColorLimit" command has been
obsoleted ?

>From fvwm.1

     "ColorLimit limit
           This command is obsolete. See the  -color-limit  option
           to fvwm."

I'm satisfied with '61' colors I guess, no need to expand that number :-)

Thanks for all your help.

'Echo' writes to stderr. Fine, but which xterm is displaying stderr? 
I've even tried "xterm -C", but that didn't show anything either.

That depends on how you start Fvwm.
Are you using startx, CDE, or some other login manager?

Fvwm doesn't reopen or redirect stderr, whatever the parent
process did with it, stays in effect.

On Mac OS X the whole of X starts by clicking on some application.

I guess that means stderr gets lost somewhere.

I'll see what happens if I start X by 'startx' from a terminal.

But on a normal workstation, after you type 'startx' you don't see 
the original shell anymore. How can you then look at stderr output?

If you type startx in Linux console 1, you can switch back to
it by typing Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then you see stderr.

For Linux, I sometimes do:

startx >/tmp/startx.out 2>&1

And then you can 'tail -F' it, right? That should do the trick.

After using fvwm2 with increasing confidence for some 6 months and
gradually learning the "fvwm2 language", I am again attempting to read
the fvwm2 man page - and crashed almost at Square One. The man page
states:

The (m by n) size (i.e. number of pages) of the virtual desktops can
       be changed any time, by **using the DeskTopSize built-in command.**

Simple.

If I could find the "built-in command".

I recollect that one fvwm2rc file offers an option that relates to the
number of pages on the desktop.  Perhaps the fvwm2 man page should be
studied while the fvwm2rc file displayed in another window?  And, if so,
which of the sample-fvwm2rc files?

It's in the section "COMMANDS CONTROLLING THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP"

I use the html version of the man page on the fvwm web site.

I'm not sure the phrase "built-in" adds anything.
I think this has come up before, and the phrase might be removed.
Do you think it would be clearer if it just said:

"using the DeskTopSize command."

I do not know how many colors can support your card but you run it
with 256 colors only. I know nothing about X with Solaris but with
XFree you can either pass an option to your Xserver (via startx) or
edit the XF86Config config file to set the depth.  With XFree-3 the
option is -bpp the_depth, with XFree-4 it is -depth the_depth. Typical
depth are 2 (2 colors), 4 (8 colors), 8 (256, colors your case), 15
(2^15 colors), 16, 24 and 32. Try man X and man startx. Let us
know if you found the trick.

I do not think it will "solve" your pbs. The icons will look
different. It does not work as there is a bug in the code (at present
time it works only when the button has the Colorset:
*FvwmButtons: (Colorset 10, Icon rcalc.xpm, ...). 
This will be fixed in an incomming snapshot.

This is a bit arbitrary. The 61 colors tables make a good
approximation of your icons, but the 64 colors table (the default one)
does not make your icons ugly (ask someone which never see these icons
if one of the two FvwmButtons screen shot that you send to the list is
really better than the other one). Also the 64 colors table is a
standard (can be use by gtk, qt and maybe java if you know how to
configure these "libs" and this is important when you need to share
256 colors). Anyway, fvwm let you choose the table you want.

That is your EnableGradients on/off. But it does not disable gradient,
this is not the point. The point is dithering which is a technique which
allows to multiply colors. It needs special colors tables for fast
rendering.  What we should do is to add some grey colors to these
tables and use it when we do not dither (default for icons).

Yes. A bit technical to explain.

xdpyinfo says your card can do three depths, b/w, 8 bit pseudocolor,
and 24 bit truecolor.  The default however is 8 bit.

How you change this depends on your X server.

On a Sun, there are a few different commands, depending on your
hardware, one of them is m64config, the man page may help.

On Linux, look at your XF86Config file, it should be easy to spot
what needs changing, or use one of the GUIs supplied.

Its not really necessary to do that if you do the -color-limit thingie.
We're still working on the documentation.  One of the issues is
how will the user decide which of the many color limit choices
he should use.

I think this stuff is still under development.
The need for the colorlimit command went away in the 2.4.x release,
the default colorlimiting was usually enough.

I think we still need to work out what the new default should be.

This is a beta, so your opinion, which I think you made clear,
won't be ignored.

Olivier,  I don't know if that will help, for one thing it will use
up more colors.  I don't know if we discussed this before, but
the 61 color table had a lot of colors in it that were designed to
evenly fill the gaps in the perceptual (HVC) colorspace.
I believe the new
tables are optimized for gradients by spacing the colors evenly in
a linear colorcube.  That can leave some pretty big gaps in
the perceptual colorspace.

Thats not to say that the 61 color color table won't turn gray
into pink or green, I've seen it do that.

I don't know if we discussed any color theory before, I hope this
stuff makes some sense to you (perceptual and linear colorspaces).
I'm not a color expert, but I did some
study of this stuff when I came up with the original 61 colors
and the matching algorithm.  The matching algorithm in Fvwm is
not the algorithm used to create the 61 color color table, since
the perceptual match algorithm is too slow for Fvwm use.

I still have the source code for the program I used to fill in
the gaps if you're interested.

Of course they are nice. :-)

But the real reason is that some of the icon sets were designed to work
well will 8-bit displays. Here is 48x48-infox icons set that will be
included with the next version soon, it uses only 15 colors:

You should use ClickTime, it applies to double click as well.

SetEnv gets 2 strings, the first is the name and the second is the value.
You should use PipeRead, but the environment of the child does not affect
the parent fvwm process, so you should do something like:

  PipeRead 'echo SetEnv x `$(( $[x] + 1 ))`'

Or better yet use FvwmPerl instead (if you use 2.5.x) after running it:

Hi all,

I know this was a post of a while ago, but has this been implemented
yet? Will it ever be ?

cheers,

I have a form to rename a desktop:
  Module FvwmForm NameDesk

defined as

# name this desktop
DestroyModuleConfig NameDesk: *
*NameDesk: WarpPointer
*NameDesk: Line left
*NameDesk: Text "Name this desktop:"
*NameDesk: Line expand
*NameDesk: Input deskname 20 ""
*NameDesk: Button quit "OK" ^M
*NameDesk: Command Echo $d "$(deskname)"
*NameDesk: Command *FvwmPager: Label $d "$(deskname)"
*NameDesk: Command RestartPager
*NameDesk: Button quit "Cancel"

where

AddToFunc RestartPager
+ I KillModule FvwmPager
+ I DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPager
+ I Module FvwmPager 0 $[FVWM_N_DESKS]


Now the echo command displays "1 TheName" but Desk 0 gets renamed. I'm stymied.

I asked this once before, but couldn't figure it out.  I'm running fvwm 2.5.2 
on Red Hat 7.3.  Is there support for KDE 3?  If not, how to enable it?  When 
I use the script file it seems to indicate that KDE is not installed on my 
computer, which it is.

Thanks in advance

Hi !

this is just to let you know that I upgraded yesterday to RedHat 8.0,
recompiled successfully FVWM from CVS with GCC 3.2 without errors.

It's running smoothly. Great !!

Thanks a lot to all of you !

regards,
Giuseppe.

PS
too bad that RH has decided to remove FVWM from their distribution.

PPS
one more file to be added to .cvsignore: autom4te-2.53.cache
(from autoheader 2.53).

I think I will implement it sometimes. The biggest problem is the syntax.
It should be chosen so that no changes are needed in the future.
We have conditional branches now, maybe "On" is better to be reserved for
them instead. Probably add 3 new prefixes: OnStartUp, OnRestart, OnQuit.

Mikhael.

Please always specify the version you use.

For 2.5.x, you should preferably use DesktopName instead of "*FvwmPager:
Label" although the second is also supported for now.

  *NameDesk: Command DesktopName $d $(deskname)

If you use 2.4.x I will post another solution for this expanding problem.

Mikhael.

Please. I'm quite at a loss how Echo can have the right value but not 
the other command.

  *NameDesk: Command PipeRead `echo "*FvwmPager: Label $d '$(deskname)'"`

This is needed because $d is expanded in PipeRead, but not in "*NameDesk:"
or "*FvwmPager:" for compatibility with some module configs.

I dont use redhat, but for me It didnt work by default because my 
sytem uses KDEDIRS and not a KDEDIR envirroment variable, but that was
easily fixed. 
      `echo $KDEDIR` if it doesnt output anything then..
try   `export KDEDIR=/usr/kde/3`
then: `fvwm-menu-desktop --lang=en --desktop kde-sys --merge-user-menu`

OK, after some digging I figured out that the video card on the Sun-Ultras
here is set to 8+24 depth (that is 8 __and__ 24 bit) -- in other words its
24-bit enabled, but is capable of showing 8-bit only applications (in case
those applications check, I guess).

Here's the video command and the output,

  $ pgxconfig -prconf

  --- Hardware Configuration for /dev/fbs/gfxp0 ---
  Type: GFX8P
  Board: TSI Raptor GFX 8P
  PROM Information: 1.11 99/07/06 TSI
  DAC: TSI RAMDAC 0x31
  RAM: 8MB
  EDID Data: 1024x768x85, 800x600x85, 640x480x85, 1152x864x85,
  1600x1200x85, 1600x1200x75, 1800x1440x75, 640x480x60, 640x480x75,
  800x600x60, 800x600x75, 1024x768x60, 1024x768x75, 1280x1024x75
  Current resolution setting: 1280x1024x75
  Possible depths: 8, 24, 8+24
  Current depth: 8+24

and

  $ pgxconfig -propt

  --- OpenWindows Configuration for /dev/fbs/gfxp0 ---
  OWconfig: system
  Video Mode: none
  Depth: 24

OK, does 24-bit really work, well I did the following,

  xv -24 -best -perfect -cmap -cgeom -0-0 kittens.jpg

And in the "XV Controls" window it notes using "24-bit mode. Using TrueColor
visual" meaning the solaris Xserver (Xsun) is capable of 24-bit.  So I asked
a sys-admin friend and he noted that "xdpyinfo is probably unable to
understand 8+24 mode and is simply returning the first result it sees when
multiple options are available."  So I'm not sure how fvwm determines what
the X-server is capable of, but its figuring them to be 8-bit on this
machine when they really need to be 24-bit (is it grabbing xdpyinfo's
output ?).  Anything I can do to make fvwm resolve to 24-bit short of
restarting the server with that depth setting explicitly (meaning I'd
have to call the powers that be to change the configuration on this
machine - after a million+1 questions) ?  What do other window managers
(like CDE) do to resolve this ?

Thanks

Gee, pretty neat video card.

A couple of things (I must be cursed or something :-) I get the same
"odd" results using either method noted above (ie. visual or visualId).

1. You might want to apply the following patch for all those '-visual'
   options to work (it currently looks only for the first letter on
   most of the visual options and so if you have "truecolor" that will
   not trigger anything -- contrary to what the man page says; ie.
   truecolor should work as an option).  Otherwise do a string crawl to
   compare only the first character of the word or something.

2. I also tried to start with '-visualId' set to 0x26 since xdpyinfo
   notes,

    ...
    visual id:    0x25
    class:    StaticGray
    depth:    8 planes
    available colormap entries:    256
    red, green, blue masks:    0x0, 0x0, 0x0
    significant bits in color specification:    8 bits
  visual:
    visual id:    0x26
    class:    TrueColor
    depth:    24 planes
    available colormap entries:    256 per subfield
    red, green, blue masks:    0xff0000, 0xff00, 0xff
    significant bits in color specification:    8 bits

In either case, I get the following stderr output - what does it
mean ?

 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
 [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0

And all my FvwmButtons are rather scrambled and ... well take a look for
yourself - a small image is attached.  Otherwise all else seems ok.

What am I doing wrong ?

Using snap-20020926

Thanks

Well, running fvwm 2.5.x in a different visual than the default visual is
totally broken at present time (but with depth <= 8 and a dynamic
visual class (PseudoColor, GreyScale and DirectColor)). I hope that
this will be fixed in a few days.

This says that XPutImage fail (parameter mismatch, a gc problem I guess
when loading an xpm) and it is the reason of your icon pbs in FvwmButtons.

Hum, Do you use some xpm image in others place (menus, Icon and MiniIcon
style?). I guess that no xpm image will be displayed fine.

In theory you do nothing wrong, you just fall on a bug. The 2.5.x
series is **alpha-alpha** at present time. In practice, I am not sure
it is a good idea to run fvwm with a visual != than the default
visual.
In an other mail you wrote:

If you start fvwm without -visual{Id} it asks the server for the
default visual and use it (I do not think that fvwm is broken here; it
does not grep xdpyinfo, it uses the X library).  But, why you do
not always start your Xserver with 24-bit set explicitly?  I've no
experience with 8+24 depth video cards, but it seems to me that the
depth 8 is useful for applications which work only with a depth 8
dynamic visual (PseudoColor) because, for example, the application
needs read-write colors. So, if you do not use such apps or if you use
such apps which can found this depth 8 visual alone or via an option I
think you should start your Xserver with 24-bit. 

Others reasons to do not use 24-bit by default:
- This may use more memory (???)
- Your Xserver driver is not accelerated with this mode.

In abstract if you do not have good reasons to do not use 24-bit
by default, use it!

So now if you have a good reason for using 8-bit by default either
- Do not use the -visual{Id} option (fvwm with 256 colors,
maybe when fvwm will become beta the -color-limit 61 option
will be not needed).
- Use the -visual{Id} option (wait a few days for 2.5.x or use
fvwm-2.4.11).

Hello,

I'm using fvwm 2.5.3 and want to get alt-tab behaviour like the one in
another GUI :). I.e. if I'm using two applications, I would expect that
alt-tab switches between them. This is what I cannot get now.

Windows in the WindowList are shifted cyclically and that means that
when I press alt-tab, the current window goes to the end of the list
(assume CurrentAtEnd is on) and then if I want to switch to it again,
it's not sufficient to just press alt-tab, I have to press it many times
so that to reach the next to last entry at which the previously used
application resides.


Best regards,
  Andrey Urazov

Ooops, Non. fvwm try to found the "best" visual. So there is a

Hi all,

In fvwm or XF86 in general, is there a way to switch between
the "Display" sections in XF86config-4 ?

I want to switch between different monitors (with a switchbox)
on the one video card, but the monitors have different capabilities.

This is a bug. I believe it was introduced in 2.5.3 after FP* style
additions. The source problem is that FlipFocus works just like Focus.
I think that when this is fixed, WindowList will work as usual.

Hello.

I've got a MRT Viewport camera where the internal battery was removed. After 
this I am not able to establish contact with the camera. Is there a fixed 
IP-adress in the camera ? I also tried with a serialcable using 
hyperterminal, but stil now contact. I have the rom, dchp, and changemac 
uppdate programs for it. Ijust am not able to send them to the camera.
If anyone could help me with this, I would be verry grateful.

Kjetil Nilsen.
Norway.

In a really absurd way, I'm happy to hear that :-)  At least its nothing
very particular with my setup and is something that is visible elsewhere.
I'll keep posted for a fix to give it a try.

I think there are like 3-4 menu icons that I played with at some point
and simply left-in to show people (you know to wow 'em :-)  Is that a
problem ?  Should I remove 'em ?  If you'd like me to run some debug code
for ya, don't hesitate to let me know.

Are you saying that running with a visual != default visual is a bad
idea now or in general ?  I can see why the "now" would makes sense, but
if it were an "in general" statement, then I don't really know what
to say.

I use a great deal of third-party applications and I'm not sure which
require 8-bit and which don't.  If I were to restart the Xserver in
24-bit, I'd require the help of the sys-admins here (which usually turn
into a brief interrogation) and if things don't work I will be on very
shaky ground to ask 'em to revert me back (you know that "evil eye" thing),
etc (the option of me controlling that setting/file is not much of an
option - don't ask).

Simply put, don't want to deal with the appropriate authorities :-)
due to hassle since its nothing that I personally control.  Its not
technical at all.

I've grabbed 2.4.11 and will keep an eye out for a commit that addresses
visuals to grab a snapshot (2.4.11 worked great btw).  Do let me know if
I can help.

In fact I do not know what we should do with a card with 2 depths
for a given visual. I found nothing in the X lib (or in the Xevi
extension) for such a situation. I imagine that there is an X extension
to deal with this situation and we should use it to choose the desired
depth.

Why shouldn't the Fvwm command line arg work as advertised?

My thanks to both respondents for the prompt replies.

I use the supplied man page and load it into the vim editor.

If I had searched for "DeskTopSize" rather than for "built=ADin command" =
I
would have got from line 152 to line 4162 of the man page in two jumps.

However, the information presented still fails to address my real
problem.  It points out that I should now be using the "GotoDesk"
command.  And the "GotoDesk" command advises:

 GotoDesk prev | arg1 [ arg2 ] [ min max ]
	      Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room)=
.  =20

Which still does not tell me how to **run** the command.

It looks as though the missing link may be in:

FVWM Modules -> Start Regular Modules -> FVWM Console -> GotoDesk [arg].

And, doubtless, sooner or later I will get to the full story in my crawl
through the man page(s).

Since this exploration is an educational exercise and I am a geriatric
with plenty of time on my hands, I can wait until all is revealed
- either in man fvwm2 or in man FvwmConsole or perhaps even in man
FvwmCommand.

Meanwhile, let me flag that I am deriving great joy and satisfaction
from the elegance and economy of fvwm2 and from the many useful hints
that are contained in answers to queries posted to the user list.

If your problem is to change the desktop size, just run in FvwmConsole:

  DeskTopSize 4x2

like suggested in the man page.

GotoDesk is just another command. Did you try in FvwmConsole to run:

  GotoDesk prev         # return to the previous desk
  GotoDesk 1            # goto the next desk   (-1 would mean previous)
  GotoDesk 0 1          # goto the next desk   (-1 would mean previous)
  GotoDesk 1 0 3        # cicle from desk 0 to desk 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0

I think the man page describes this although without examples.

But it seems you use fvwm-themes. If yes, there are 2 solutions to change
the desktop size. Choose another "modules" component, for example the one
in the Luthien theme uses four pages 2x2, the Default theme uses 3x3 page=
s.
Or you may create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/modules-extra file and place on=
e
line in it "DeskTopSize 3x2". Then refresh themes and load this new
modules-extra component from menus.

Also at any time press Shift-Ctrl-Mouse2 to get a transient multi-desk
pager in fvwm-themes if you are lost in desks and pages.
If you do use fvwm-themes, consider to ask on its own mailing list.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This list is a really incorrect place to ask your question. Your chanses
to get an answer would be higher than zero on a video camera related list.

Ctrl-Alt-plus/or minus can switch resolutions, but
I don't think thats the same thing.
Xinerama can support 2 different monitors at the same time,
somehow you might be able to utilize that.
This is really an XFree86 question.

New user question, FreeBSD 4.4
I put  fvwm2 &  in ~/.xinitrc and fvwm2 works OK.

I now see  ~/.fvwm,  it's an empty directory. Is it correct
to put the local configuration file  .fvwm2rc  inside this  
~/.fvwm directory ?

Should I copy my system.fvwm2rc to the  ~/.fvwm directory, rename
it .fvwm2rc, and make my personal changes to this .fvwm2rc file?

Would it be OK to only have the config lines I want to change in
.fvwm2rc and not the whole file?

Thanks

Yes, it is preferable to keep all config files in ~/.fvwm, it is also
in your "Read" search path and some modules/scripts use this directory.

You may.

It should be the whole file, but you may achieve the same effect by having
the first line in ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc:

  Read /your/system.fvwm2rc

Mikhael.

Yes.

No, it will only read one or the other.

Just an FYI.  I downloaded snap-20021004 which contains those changes and
I have a couple of comments.

 1. The '-visual TrueColor' option (as well as the '-visualId 0x26') still
    don't work and produces the same scrambled pixmaps that were noted
    before (I'll attach something).  The same errors are produced,

	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0
	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0
	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
	[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 72, Error 8, EventType: 0

 2. The inclusion of the new greys made things a tad better in 8-bit mode
    (at least one doesn't see greens instead of greys now :-), but the browns
    and possibly yellows (note that pesky clamp.xpm) are gone (I'll attach
    something also).

So, if the fixes noted are not complete just yet (ie. I'm jumping the gun),
please excuse me otherwise the issues are still there.

Thanks

Hi all

=09I just got another videocard+monitor and configure a dual-head Xfree (=

saw=20
that I can call fvwm2 with parameter -d <display>. but fvwm seems to be n=

respecting this! I tried to run icewm together with fvwm2 (one on each sc=

of course), but fvwm2 insist in running on both displays!

=09I tried the following:

=092 - from the xterm launch icewm with: icewm -display :0.1 (ok... it wo=

=093 - launch fvwm2 with: fvwm2 -d :0.0 (them fvwm just launched on both=20
displays!)

=09I'm running fvwm2 snapshot from last week (cant remember the day...).=20

=09This is a bug or am I doing something wrong?

Did you or someone else try rpms for RedHat 6 or 7 from fvwm.org?

Theoretically they may work, but there are so many issues here that
noone may know in advance.

I think we may drop RedHat 6 rpms and support only users of RedHat 7 and 8
in the near future.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Try "fvwm -s -d :0.0" instead. The -s means manage only one screen.

The -visual option fixes are work in progress. I will send you

* Does that happen to any windows or only to the windows of a
  specific application?  Since the window doesn't die during a
  restart hints at a window that wasn't created by fvwm.
* What info does FvwmIdent diplay about such windows?
* What does "xwininfo -tree" say?

Try something like this:

  AddToFunc my_raise
  + I Current (FvwmPager) Layer 0 6
  + I Current (!FvwmPager) Raise

  AddToFunc my_lower
  + I Current (FvwmPager) Layer 0 4
  + I Current (!FvwmPager) Lower

  Then replace all calls of "Raise" and "Lower" in your config
  file with "my_raise" and "my_lower".  Depending on how you work
  on your desktopn, this may not work very well for you
  (specifically, clicking inside the pager window to raise it does
  not stick it on top).  Feel free to ask again if it's not good
  enough yet.

I agree.  It just makes the man page harder to read.  The vague
information that it's an fvwm config "language" command and not a
shell command is worth about nothing.  I vot for dumping that term
from the man page.

Thanks, this will make using FVWM much more comfortable. Is the fix only
available through CVS or maybe there is a patch somewhere?

If I invoke FvwmIdent from the console, it waits for me to click in a 
window (fvwm 2.4.11); if I invoke it as

AddToMenu fvwm
+ "Source fvwmrc" Read /Users/victorle/.fvwm2rc
+ "Restart fvwm" Restart
+ "Console" Module FvwmConsole
+ "Ident" Module FvwmIdent

then it give the information immediately. Is there a way to invoke 
from a menu and still have it wait for me to click somewhere?

You should be invoking the "fvwm" menu from decorations and not
as the root menu, otherwise you would not have see behaviour.

To trick the window context (i.e. to remove it), you may use:

  None ("abracadabra") Module FvwmIdent

I plan to add a more relable NoWindow to remove the window context.

Mikhael.

Hi,

I've got two video cards installed with their own monitors.
I'm trying to get both monitors to have an identical display.
The first monitor works ok, but the second monitor only shows
the default grey background of X, the fvwm pager, and has no
mouse pointer or other windows. How can i do that?

THis looks like XF86 adds these key symbols to it's tables only
after fvwm has started.  Thus, fvwm wouldn't know about these
keys.  The latest 2.5.x code should be able to take care of this.
Of course that's no solution, but it would be interesting to know
if it works.

I vaguely remember a similar problem but I'm not sure what the
solution was.  Searching the mailing list archive may help.

At
	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/RH/FVWM-RPMS/JTL/

you will find some source RPMS that are Red Hat 7 ready, i.e. they work as is
with a standard Red Hat 7 install. I have not tried them with Red Hat 8 yet,
but feel free to try it yourself and let me know.

E.g. obtain:

	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/RH/FVWM-RPMS/JTL/fvwm2-2.4.11-1.src.rpm

Then

	rpm -i fvwm2-2.4.11-1.src.rpm
	rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/fvwm2.spec

and, if that succeeds,

	rpm -U /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/fvwm2-*2.4.11*

Good luck!

Best wishes, John Latham

Assuming you use XFree86, you have to decide if you want to use
Xinerama or an old style multi head setup.  With Xinerama, you
get one big logical screen (usually ":0.0") and you can move
windows between the two screens, but both screens must have the
same number of bitplanes (colours).  With the other setup you get
two logical screens (":0.0" and ":0.1").  A separate copy of fvwm
runs on both screens.  Windows can not be moved from one screen to
the other, but both screens can have a different number of
bitplanes.  I recommend to use the Xinerama setup if possible, but
I can't help you to bring it up.

In both setups you can transfer the pointer between both monitors
by simply moving it over the adjacent edge of the screen.  To
start the application windows, modify your .fvwm2rc.  Look for the
StartFunction, InitFunction and RestartFunction definitions and
start the applications you need on both screens.  With Xinerama
it's pretty straightforward.  With a multi head setup you can add
a line

  Read .fvwm2rc.$[screen]

somewhere in your .fvwm2rc file and add screen specific commands
in these files:

  .fvwm2rc.0
  .fvwm2rc.1

For example, my .fvwm2rc.0 is empty while my .fvwm2rc.1 looks like
this:

  DestroyFunc InitFunction
  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I StandardSetup

The "StandardSetup" function takes care of bringing up my terminal
windows and fvwm modules on the current screen.

There are some paragraphs about Xinerama setups in the fvwm man
page that you should read if you go with Xinerama.

Good idea.  However, it's already possible to delete the window
context with the WindowId command:

  WindowId Root Module FvwmIdent

With Xinerama, do both screens also have to have the same display height
and width?

Has anyone successfully run fvwm2 on Solaris's Xsun in Xinerama mode?  If
so, any lessons learned?  Can the graphics cards be heterogeneous
provided the color depths are the same?

On Solaris 8, it still fails during configure:

checking for XineramaIsActive in -lXinerama... no

Sun's implementation is different than the XFree86 implementation.

Understood.  Might there be a way to do a "force-fit" for Solaris?  Or are we
talking massive source code changes?

I might go with the two-separate-screens option. What i really
wanted is to have the same logical screen 0.0 cloned on both
monitors, so that a mouse cursor is displayed in the same
place on both monitors simultaneously. However, i think
the missing mouse cursor on the cloned screen is a more
basic problem in XFree86. I got the same fvwm desktop
to appear on both screens by using:
  Option "Xinerama" "yes"
  Option "CloneDisplay" "yes"
in XF86Config.

Is there a way that an application can be opened in the root window.

I would like to be able to do this for the following reasons:

+ The application would use the entire desktop space and always be
   stacked on the bottom.
+ When icons were iconified they would be "on top" of the root window
   therefore I wouldn't have to go behind the window to find them.

If there are other ways to do this please let me know.

Thanks

I hope that the next snapshot will be ok (20021008). Can you try it
with the -visual option? I've also changed the default color table
(used for 8 bits colors).

Yes, if the application provides this as an option.
xv-3.10a does: try launching "xv -root"

This is the same as remove window decorations, maximize the application to
use the entire screen size and place the application to the lower layer.
Right? If so, here is the solution that works with most of applications.

To remove the decorations:

  Style myappwindow NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, NoTitle

To place the application on the bottom ("Style m Layer 1" is also ok):

  Style myappwindow StaysOnBottom

To maximize the application automatically when it is launched, you may use
one or another method described in FAQ #3.18 (with or without FvwmEvent).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm running fvwm 2.5.2 with nautilus-1.0.6-ximian.14.  My .fvwm2rc
contains the following lines (relevant to focus):

ColormapFocus FollowsFocus
Style "*" SloppyFocus
Style "xload"		NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip, ClickToFocus

If I switch to a virtual desk or otherwise end up with no windows having
focus, my Nautilus windows do not get focused when the mouse enters.  

If I click on an xload window to bring it into focus, the nautilus
window still doesn't get focus.

However, if I have any other window open, that window will get focused
with no problems, and after that the nautilus windows get focused as
well.

As far as I can tell, this behaviour only happens with nautilus windows.

Any ideas on how I can make nautilus get focused?

All this is on a RedHat-7.2 with Ximian desktop.

Just downloaded 20021008 which does indeed contain your most recent
commits - the following 2 comments,

 + Regarding -visual and -visualId -- the problems persist (I'll
   attach a jpg), but its the same stuff that I saw from before.
   The pixmaps are not visible at all and seem to be scrambled.

 + Regarding 8bit, the buttons look overly gray now with no yellow
   or brown inclusion (I'll attach a jpg as well - note that pesky
   clamp.xpm).

On the positive side, there were no error messages on the console/stderr.

Let me know how I can help (if you need some debug output or something).

back to 2.4.11 :-)

Not from the top of my head, but please

 - upgrade to 2.5.3 or - better - the latest snapshot

Nautilus has "Focus Policy: Globally Active".  What does that mean
exactly?  I can't find any references in the docs for fvwm.

That it doesn't want to be given the focus by the window manager
but take it on its own when it sees fit.  What does FvwmIdent say
about the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol?

Anyway, it may help to give nautilus the "Lenience" style

  Style Nautilus Lenience

(replace "Nautilus" with the name/classe/resource of the windows
if necessary).

Ah yes, I hope that the next snapshot will be ok for FvwmButtons
(may be not for icons in other modules). Since the beginning
I was award of the pb I just fix, but I simply do not check
FvwmButtons code. I do not know why :o/

Rob,
I do this by opening the app in an a-term window.
 I set the handles, title and borders off with a
style command.  Only works if its a terminal app
(like top) though

Greetings!  I've recently returned to fvwm after a few years absence -
it's even more fun than I remembered.  2.5.3 on Debian Woody.

I'm trying to branch out a little with FvwmButtons; appended below is a
specimen which will undoubtedly make you laugh or cry!  The four
identical buttons are just for experiment at this stage ;-)  The specific
error I get from this is

"MyBar2: unmatched END in config file"


It looks to me like the END is matched - can anyone tell me what is
missing?  

Is there anything else missing? ie what is a reasonable minimum
configuration for a small panel to fire up four programs?




8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------

FvwmButtons MyBar2

*MyBar2:Geometry +0+500
*MyBar2:BoxSize smart
*MyBar2:Back red
*MyBar2:Fore white

The (End) should not be there, as it should be used in connection with 
Container only. Since you have no Containter defined, use of (End) is 
syntactically incorrect.

Yes, and it tripped one of the hundreds of spam filters and was sent

Sorry folks; for some reason Dominik sets his email address as
fvwm@fvwm.org even for personal messages and I didn't catch it when I
replied.

I know this must be a *VERY* simple thing to do with
fvwm but I haven't seemed to find anything saying how
to set the "desktop" to a specific color.

Question 6.6 in the FAQ:

6.6  How do I set the background with fvwm?

A: Setting the background image is not really part of the window
   manager.  If you are using one of the Linux distributions,
   most likely, some part of the distribution is setting the background
   for you.

   There is a program shipped with fvwm (fvwm-root, previously known as
   xpmroot) that you can use to set the background to XPM or PNG image.
   Other programs like "xv", "xli", "xloadimage", and "display" may be
   used too, they support some image formats that fvwm-root does not.

   If you just want a static image on your background, you might invoke
   one of these programs from your .xsession or .xinitrc file.  You can
   also invoke one of these programs from the InitFunction in your
   .fvwm2rc.

   The fvwm module FvwmBacker can be used to change the background
   depending on the desk you are currently on.

I have this in my
~/.fvwm/themes/personal/background
file (I really hope I understand this file correctly: it's some weeks
ago I changed it, IIRC .. :):

############################################
DestroyFunc FuncFvwmStartThemeBackground
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmStartThemeBackground
#+ I exec xsetroot -bg blue -fg black
+ I exec xsetroot -solid rgb:2C/57/F5


DestroyFunc FuncFvwmStopThemeBackground
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmStopThemeBackground
+ I Nop
###########################################

Important, as it seems, this line:
+ I exec xsetroot -solid rgb:2C/57/F5
this gives you an *extremely beautiful blue background :)


this line :
#+ I exec xsetroot -bg blue -fg black
is (as I hope :) my backup of what was there valid before.

Rick:
My apologies for having sent you back some moments ago my definitely
incomplete answer to your mail ... this was an accident: Sorry about
that ...

Regards
Wolfgang

I use a nice little program called "chameleon"!  It's available on the
Debian sites but haven't been able to find it  elsewhere.

Thanks.

Two follow-up questions:

How do I specify multiple actions ("Layer 0 4" followed by "Lower")?

Can I bind mouse actions to a specific window?  That is, can I add
some syntax like "(FvwmPager)" to a configuration statement/line/whatever
like:

  Mouse 1	TS	A	Move-or-Raise

to make it apply to just the named window?

Thanks,
Daniel

Technically, questions about betas are better asked on fvwm-workers.

By definig a complex function:

  AddToFunc my_lower_to_layer_4
  + I Layer 0 4
  + I Lower

  AddToFunc my_raise_to_layer_6
  + I Layer 0 6
  + I Lower

Then call

  my_lower_to_layer_4

or

  my_raise_to_layer_6

Not exactly, but you can simulate it with conditional commands:

  Mouse 1 TS A Move-or-Raise
  Mouse 2 TS A my_lower

  DestroyFunc Move-or-Raise
  AddToFunc Move-or-Raise
  + C my_raise
  + M my_raise
  + M Move

  AddToFunc my_raise
  + I ThisWindow (FvwmPager) Layer 0 6
  + I Raise

  AddToFunc my_lower
  + I ThisWindow (FvwmPager) Layer 0 4
  + I Lower

Bye

I use a program called xvirtualroot (attached).  All it does is
display an image or color in a full-sized window.  Any mouse clicks on
the xvirtualroot window get passed to the root window underneath (so
fvwm mappings on the root window work).

Then in my .fvwm2rc, I have:

Style XVirtualRoot CirculateSkip, StaysOnBottom, NeverFocus, NoTitle, NoHandles, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0, StartsLowered

Since I have three desktops, I start three xvirtualroot windows (one
on each desktop, with different background images) at startup.

xvirtualroot also supports the __SWM_VROOT window property, which some
window managers use to designate the "virtual" root window.
Subsequently programs which support this property (like xv) can draw
to this window.  For example, running "xv --root ..." will result in
xv drawing to the xvirtualroot window instead of the actual X root
window.

    Usage: xvirtualroot [-display <display>] [-w] -f <file> [-bg <color>]
        xvirtualroot [-display <display>] [-w] -bg <color>
        xvirtualroot --help
        xvirtualroot --version

    Options:

    -f <file>           Specify the image file to display.  Use
                        "-" to read from STDIN.

    -bg <color>         Set the background color of the window.

    -w                  Print the X window ID of the xvirtualroot window.
                        Useful when using another program to draw
                        in the xvirtualroot window.

    -display <display>  Specify the X server to contact.

    --help              Print this message and exit.

    --version           Print version information and exit.

Hi there!

Well, I am probably wrong here, but since I am subscribed to this list
only, I think I'll get the fastest response here.

I am trying to install fvwm2 with fvwm-themes on a redhat 8.0. At the
beginning, I tried the newest 2.4.18 with 0.6.1 (latest). The error
message was:

(make install runs fine to this point)
...
/usr/local/bin/fvwm-themes-config --site --reset
Warning: unknown entry [t0c0], ignoring...
Incorrect line key value, not enough +'s
make[2]: *** [install-data-local] Error 255
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/andre/build/fvwm-themes-base-0.6.0'
make[1]: *** [install-am] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/andre/build/fvwm-themes-base-0.6.0'
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1


Bang. The same happened with a 2.4.8 and 0.6.0 and combinations.

What's wrong there?

TIA

Andr=C3=A9

I'm using fvwm-2.5.3, with ClickToFocus.  I have a 3x3 array of
virtual desktops.  Is there some way that I can tell fvwm to remember
which was the last focussed application on each virtual desktop, so
that when I switch back to that (virtual) desktop the focus is
restored?  Currently when I switch to a different virtual desktop my
focus is left behind with the previous application, now off-screen.

Hi,
i downloaded a nightly build of the latest xfree86 server. then i tried
to compile fvwm on it. however, fvwm doesn't detect xft2. I then
searched for xft-config and it was not provided by the new xserver. i
then referred to the fvwm mailing list archives, and found the topic of
discussion abt xft2. someone had tried to use some patch to acinclude.m4
as a solution which was then discarded by others who contested that the
way of patching was wrong. Can anyone help me compile fvwm?
i did find fontconfig-config and freetype-config in /usr/X11R6/bin
I am not stuck because i had removed x b4 and did a clean install of the
xserver the latest cvs build which was built successfully. can anyone
post a patch if there exists one, or provide a solution?

regards
Rahul

I've recently started using .png images to get those smooth anti-aliased
image effects, and whilst it works perfectly for titlebar buttons, menu
icons etc., it does absolutely nothing concerning menu side pixmaps. 

I'm using fvwm release 2.5.3.

I've tried both the "direct" approach (using "@picture.png@" in menu title
definitions), and the SidePic option of the MenuStyle command. Both of
them work identically - the image is shown, but it doesn't get
antialiased, and it seems that the side image is getting only a 1 bit
deep alpha channel. And all those nice .png images look as if they were
plain .xpm :(

So, am I doing something wrong? Or is it that png alpha-blending hasn't
yet been fully implemented in menu side pics?

This is fixed in the current cvs and so in the next alpha release: 2.5.4.

I suppose you have one virtual desktop with 3x3=9 pages. Desktop contains
pages. Windows may occupy several pages, but only one desk. There is also
only one focussed window per desk. So the solution for you is easy, use
virtual desktops and you will get the behaviour you want.

Example, currently you have one virtual desktop with 3x3=9 pages, but you
may configure the pager to have 3x3=9 desks and have totally 3x3x3x3=81
pages. To get such hyper cube, do:

  DesktopSize 3 3
  *FvwmPager: Columns 3

  FvwmPager 0 8  # this is how you start the pager with 9 desks

But, it seems you don't need pages, so replace the DesktopSize command:

  DesktopSize 1 1

Mikhael.

This does not look like you install fvwm-themes-0.6.1.

It means there is "[t0c0]" and other garbage in some of the .cfg file.
I have no any idea how such garbage would slip to the package. Trojan? :)

I don't know what to suggest here. Can you debug this problem?

Did you try to install the rpms we have on our site?

Run autoheader.

Or better yet, if you use cvs, you may run:

  utils/configure_dev.sh [configure-params]

It is strange that xft-config is not installed under the X bin
directory. I just update the current X cvs and make install
fontconfig and Xft and I get a new xft-config at the good place.
Maybe Xft fail to compile (I do not know if make World will
generate a fatal make error in this case). Do you have 
the file /usr/X11/lib/libXft.so.2.0 ?

Does

rpm -qf /usr/X11R6/lib/libXft.so.2.0

match your new X rpm?

Maybe you should send a bug report to the builder of
the rpm you use.

Maybe. There is a separated package for fontconfig, XRender and
Xft. Its name is "fontconfig" and a source tarball can be found
via http://fontconfig.org

You really need to be more specific:

 * What fvwm version do you have?  (try "fvwm2 -version")
 * What module do you use to swallow these applications?
 * Are you sure you have xeyes and asclock installed?  Can you
   start them from the command line?
 * What config lines do you have to swallow these modules?

P.S.:

Please adjust the time and date on your machine.  According to the
mail header, your mail was sent 6 months ago.

I have the following script to start a terminal, it permits to set an env
variable and provides some fallbacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/sh

if [ -n "$TERMINAL" ]; then
    `$TERMINAL` $* >/dev/null 2>@1
elif [ `which gnome-terminal` ]; then
    gnome-terminal --start-factory-server --use-factory -t "Terminal" $*
>/dev/null 2>@1
elif [ `which rxvt` ]; then
    rxvt -t Terminal $* > /dev/null 2>@1
else
    xterm -t Terminal $* > /dev/null 2>@1
fi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If I start gnome-terminals via FvwmConsole using the command line:
gnome-terminal --start-factory-server --use-factory -t "Terminal"

those terminals will share the same process (as inteded).
But if I use the script tried both in a menu and using FvwmConsole, the
terminals start in their own processes. There is a process called
"gnome-pty-helper"

Anyone have an idea?
(I would like to be able to use this script to increase the portability of
my configuration)

Thanks for the info, that's one more reason for me to start using the
CVS version.

BTW, there's another thing that puzzles me - is there a way to assign
"Style" attributes to a single, perhaps not-quite-so-unique window?

I often have a couple (or so) xterms opened, which as far as I can tell
have all identical atributes (Class/Name/Title etc.)

I would hovewer find it usefull to have a keybinding that, say, turns
the active windows "FixedPosition" state on. But the Style command
accepts only name, class or resource strings, and with multiple xterms
those strings are shared among all of those little pests. I know that
I can force an xterm to change it's title to something unique, either
with a command line/X resource option, or with an escape sequence at
run-time, but that really isn't a solution. For a moment I thought that
"Style xterm IndexedWindowName" could come usefull here, but it only
changes the appearance of the titlebar, and so it does not influence the
"Style" command... If only Style would support "$w" (WindowID)...

Am I asking for the impossible, or have I just overlooked something
obvious?

Yeah, sorry, it's the copy/paste of 0.6.0. But 0.6.1 looks quite
similar, if not 100% same.

Where is this cfg? I currently don't have my notebook with me (going to
austria to have some relaxing holidays, *yippie*), and I can't check,
but if you give me a hint?

I will try. My wife won't like me to sit in front of the PC too much ...
Maybe in two weeks or so. Better late than never.

No. There's one reason for this: Since my ol' SuSE 5.x, I didn't work
with fvwm's RPMS. I always wanted to compile it myself. Now, it's almost
the same with fvwm-themes. It's just too kewl to be installed with an
RPM. Weird it sounds, but it's like that.

Thanks!

This slipped garbage hypothesis does not sound realistic to me, but
if we go for it, it may be in any .cfg file.

  % grep t0c0 `find /usr/local/share/fvwm/themes -name '*.cfg' -print`
  % grep t0c0 `find $FVWM_USERDIR/themes -name '*.cfg' -print`

Actually --site reduces this to the first place only and --reset reduces
this to the default theme only.

Mikhael.

I just tried this myself and indeed, it works when called gnome-terminal
directly and does not work when called from the script. But this has
nothing to do with FVWM. Try to run this script from the command line
and you will see the same results.

You may eliminate one process by prefixing all terminal programs with
"exec" like "exec gnome-terminal --start-factory-server --use-factory".
But this does not solve the original problem. Please report to GNOME
folks.

Mikhael.

Them's a lot of options!

And still I think I could use more: the xvirtualroot program works 
fine, but in the pager it looks like a full-size window is *in front* 
of all others. (fvwm 2.4.11).

Hi All.

I'm attempting to change the style for an Eterm that I plan on using for my console (Eterm -C).  I'd like this particular Eterm to be without any decorations or handles, just stuck in a particular place.

I know how to do this with styles like so:

style "Eterm" NoTitle, Sticky, etc...

But I only want this _one_ Eterm instance to reflect this particular style, I want the rest of my Eterms to by my default style.

I guess it comes down to being able to uniquely identify each instance of an xclient so I can grab it with "Style" - and this is the part I do not know how to do.

Any info, or pointers would be great...

Thanks!
-ed

Start you special Eterm to have the unique id string (use FvwmIdent):

  Eterm -C -n Console

Please start a separate thread with a relevant subject when asking new

If something is only configurable using Style and you don't use the
unique id string, this is not possible yet. But setting Style on per
window basis (and not just on per id basis as it is now) is on to-do list.

Practically, it is often solvable without such functionality.
Just start all special xterms with -name YourUniqueId option (-n and -T
may work too) and configure Style YourUniqueId.

But of course, this is a statical solution, you ask for a dynamical one.
You may change the window name and icon name of xterm dynamically using:

  printf "\033]1;MyNewIconTitleName\007"
  printf "\033]2;MyNewWindowTitleName\007"

Then you should issue RecaptureWindow to reapply all Style settings to
xterm, or reissue the relevant Style commands with MyNewWindowTitleName.
Of course, only window-name affects Style, not icon-name.

You may force only unique window names using IndexedWindowName, like you
mentioned, but it's just the visible name that becomes unique, it is not
used in Style. So, this can't be used to apply dynamical Style changes.

Mikhael.

Yes.  I see xeyes and xclock briefly on the screen before they disappear. 
asclock finds a home in the upper left corner of my screen.

Greetings.

I've been working with iconbox to have my icons be arranged in a certain location of my screen(s) and have had quite a bit of success.

However, I've noticed that my Eterm's (and only my Eterm's at least thus far) do not iconify properly - they completely ignore the iconbox set up.  Upon further investigation I found that the Eterm's do not adhere to the:

  style "*" icon "window.xpm"

line that I have.

So, my guess is iconbox is ignoring them because they don't even *have* an icon.  It seems, however, that only the "icon" option of style is broken.  The Eterms do correctly inherit border, handles, etc from the default style "*" config lines.

For grins, even though I don't want to do it this way, I tried to run an Eterm and specifying the icon with (I really want FVWM to handle this):

  Eterm -name foo

or

  Eterm -title foo

And then, even with:

  style "foo" icon "bar.xpm"

No icon, and (I think hence) no dice with iconbox.

Any info or pointers stating why Eterm is not picking up the icon from my style "*" line would be great.

Thanks!

FvwmButtons seems to be _very_ sensitive to a number of things,
and the results are always odd.  I'll use your xeyes command as
an example and show how to trouble shoot this kind of problem.
(This pretty much describes what I actually did, too.)

First, look at the obvious differences in the command you using
for that one and the commands for others that do work.  Instead
of the above, try this,

 *FvwmButtons (- - Swallow "FvwmXeyes" \
  Exec xeyes -name "FvwmXeyes" -geometry +0+0 -bg grey67 &)

Opps, that doesn't work either.  So lets cut it down to a bare
minimum and see what happens,

 *FvwmButtons (- - Swallow "FvwmXeyes" Exec xeyes &)

Hmmm...  still won't work, so:

 *FvwmButtons (- - Swallow "FvwmXeyes" 'Exec xeyes &')

It  _still_ doesn't work!  (This one is tricky, and not at
all obvious.)  Run xeyes from the command line and then run
xwininfo on it.  The first line of information is,

   xwininfo: Window id: 0xa00007 "xeyes"

The problem is that FvmwButtons knows to grab this process by
the window id name, and if it doesn't match... it doesn't work.

 *FvwmButtons (- - Swallow "xeyes" 'Exec xeyes &')

Bingo, that one works! (It will also work if the "&" is removed
too.)  So then you can try putting your customizations back in.
The first discovery is that there is no point in using the
-geometry option, it's ignored anyway.

I'm not sure what the -name option will do with your
configuration.  On mine it causes a name to be put in the title
bar, which causes xeyes to not be swallowed correctly (but my
overall configuration tells fvwm not to decorate xeyes, so it
may be different for your config).

Another odd point is that setting the background won't do
anything unless the +shape option is also used.

So that ends up with a line that looks like

 *FvwmButtons (- - Swallow "xeyes" 'Exec xeyes -bg grey67 +shape')

You can apply the same process to the others and eventually get
them to work too.

   1) Start with the most basic command you can, just to get
      it to "work".  

      A) Copy the syntax used in a functioning example.

      B) Determine the actual window name by running
         the program and invoking xwininfo.

   2) Add other options such as framing, padding, and/or

   3) Add other program options, such as -bg.  This may
      need to be coordinated with 2) above.

Note that when something causes a problem, it might have
almost any manifestation, and generally it is exceedingly
difficult to connect what happens to what might have caused
it.  Hence stick with making exactly one change at a time,
using "killall FvwmButtons" to kill the module and then
restarting it from within fvwm each time (you don't have to
kill fvwm itself each time).

You say that you don't have any icon for Eterm at all or you have the
wrong icon? Eterm supplies its own icon picture and you should see it.
If no, something is wrong here.

Anyway, if you want to override the icon that Eterm supplies do:

  Style Eterm* IconOverride

BTW, Eterm is not the only application that provides icon picture hint.
If you use unified icon set and don't want applications to add chaos
(every application may have its own idea how its icon should look and of
which size), you may do:

  Style * IconOverride
  Style XTerm NoActiveIconOverride  # enable: xterm +ai

Tell us whether this solved your problem or not.

Mikhael.

Please use the syntax that is documented in the FvwmButtons man page:

*FvwmButtons: (Swallow "FvwmXeyes" \
	`Exec xeyes -name "FvwmXeyes" -geometry +3000+3000 -bg grey67`)

Well, here's how I made out:

- I inserted the Style Eterm* IconOverride line with no avail. :(
  Still No icon whatsoever
- I deleted ~/.Eterm
- Re-ran Eterm, and configured it they way I like.
- Minimized Eterm - got the icon back!
- But... Although I have the icon back, it is still not sticking to the iconbox
  like all my other clients are... Eterm icon just goes to the top left of
  the root window. :(

Perhaps I should provide spex now:
FreeBSD 4.6.2R
FVWM 2.4.9 (Built from FreeBSD port)

Thanks again!

I just tried to actually iconify Eterm-0.9.1 and I can reproduce this bug
with both the latest 2.4.x and 2.5.x. The icon position is always +0+0
regardless of the iconbox. I also see other weird things like the icon
picture is at separate location than the icon title or getting both the
Eterm hint icon (unmanaged) and the icon set by Icon, IconOverride.

Hopefully, this will be fixed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

That did the trick.  The SuSE staff put that in long ago (I've been slowly 
tweaking this same .fvwm2rc for a few years now).  Thanks.

Style Eterm NoIconPosition

fixes it for me. Ie, it goes into iconbox I defined on my root window.

Ok, still I remember it worked for Eterm even without this style option
(that is pretty old). So either defaults were changed once again or new
Eterm started to be broken, but it was not such bad some time ago.

The weird things seen with UseIconPosition still should be fixed.
I will rereport this.

Mikhael.

Hi

I have a title bar button (button 3) and when you click on it it makes
the window sticky. That's works fine, but I'd like fvwm to use a
different pixmap for that button when the window is sticky.  I have this
so far, but it doesn't work.

ButtonStyle 3 - MwmDecorStick
ButtonStyle 3   ActiveUp              Pixmap gtk-red/stickU.xpm
ButtonStyle 3   ActiveDown          Pixmap gtk-red/stickD.xpm
ButtonStyle 3   Inactive                 Pixmap gtk-red/stickI.xpm
ButtonStyle 3   ToggledActiveUp  Pixmap gtk-red/stickD.xpm
...
Style * MwmDecor

I'm using fvwm 2.5.3.  Thanks any help will greatly be appreciated.

I guess it will be working perfectly around fvwm-3.0 ;)

The best window matching I've seen so far is implemented is Sawfish
- especially the possibility to combine several "categories" (Class,
Name, Title, process name, locale etc.) into a single pattern, and all
of that buffed with additional regexp-ing.

The current window-matching part of the "Style" command just doesn't
seem to fit such a flexible and powerfull WM that FVWM evolved to be.

But this, on the other hand, requires me to have a CLI active in that
xterm.  And this is quite inconvenient, if not impossible, when running
some programmes, like eg. slrn.

Besides, those techniques were already known to me :) I even mentioned
them in the original mesage (X resource/command line option/escape
sequences).

There is a third possibility. It's not perfect, but works (mostly) for
me. I usually start my xterms via a Meta-x keystroke, so I can create
a wrapper around the xterm binary. A simple shell (or perl) script, that
automatically changes the "name" property of the xterm, by, let's say,
appending a unique two-letter code to the property and then running an
xterm with this modified command line. The script would only have to
remember the last used combination, and increase the "counter" every
time an xterm is run. Deallocating ID's left behind by terminated xterms
is irrelevant, although possible. This approach is trivial to code in
perl, a bit harder in pure shell, but the "pure shell" method would
cause less overhead. If coded as a fvwm-perl-module, it would work very
fast (no need to start a perl interpreter every time a "run xterm"
request is issued), and could automatically deallocate unused ID's and
styles.

You can also set xterm's class with "xterm -class foobar".  This
way you won't see the mangled string in the window title.

That depends on how you define "pretty old".  NoIconPosition was
introduced in 2.3.23 and was the default in 2.3.23 to 2.3.25
before I switched back to UseIconPosition as the default in
2.3.26.  Overall, NoIconPosition was the default for no more than
16 days (21-Nov-2000 to 6-Dec-2000).

I think either your memory or your config is failing you on this
one.

I don't see any, but I'm awaiting a bug report.

No, my memory is ok. Just installed Eterm-0.8.8 and it does not set any
+0+0 icon position, Eterm-0.9.1 does. Both without ~/.Eterm.

Ok, later, and not on this list. :)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

I use 2 Xinerama screens (with NVidia's Twinview option). I have a
FvwmButtons panel that slides on to one screen if I click on an icon.
The icon is supposed to be positioned in the top right of my second
monitor, using the line: '*BarButtons: Geometry 30x30-5+0@0'

This works provided the mouse pointer is in the first screen when FVWM
(re)starts, but if the pointer is in the second screen then the icon
disappears off somewhere else never to be seen again.

As far as I can understand the '@0' in the geometry should put the icon
in the first screen, and I can't see how that has anything to do with
the position of the pointer. Can someone explain what is happening?

Thanks,

Andy

I have the following lines:

*FvwmPager: Colorset * 1
*FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 0
*FvwmPager: NoDeskHightlight

I want the desk labels to get the colours depending on if it's the active
desk or not. But this will override the pixmaps I have set for the desks
in the pager.
If I remove the lines:
*FvwmPager: Colorset * 1
*FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 0

I get highlight of labels (in the default b/w colourset) and background
pixmaps for the desks.
I cant't find the correct soloution.

I guess this is an FVWM question only indirectly.  I've been a long time user of 
SuSE, which is (happily) still bundling FVWM in the distro.  I'm trying to get 
away from TkDesk, which is getting dated and is no longer maintained.  I was 
looking at Nautilus, but running it loads most if not all of GNOME, obliterates 
xphoon behind its own background, and plops a bunch of useless icons all over. 
Does anyone know how to stop this?

Failing that, what are some good file managers, excluding gmc and gentoo, which 
I don't like, and mc, which is text based?

Under preferences, I found a setting "use desktop", or something
like that...

I don't understand what you want to achieve. If you want to have separate
colorset for labels, it is not possible yet, they share the same colorset
with pages (Colorset for normal, HilightColorset for current).

It makes sence to implement LabelColorset (defaults to Colorset) and
HilightLabelColorset (defaults to HilightColorset) in the future.

BTW, there is no such option NoDeskHightlight, but NoDeskHilight.

Mikhael.

Hi,

I have the following situation. In /etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc I have:

Style "default-style" Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-87-100-100-p-0-iso8859-16

MenuStyle "*" mwm, Foreground black, Background grey, Greyed white, \
  Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-87-100-100-p-0-iso8859-16

among others.

In ~/.xsession-errors I have:

| [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset '-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-87-100-100-p-0-iso8859-16', trying '-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'
| [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed][-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-87-100-100-p-0-iso8859-16]:The following charsets are missing:
|  ISO8859-2

and the menus are with 
-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-101-100-100-c-0-iso8859-1 font.

I replaced -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-87-100-100-p-0-iso8859-16
with -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-101-100-100-c-0-iso8859-16 in
/etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc and restarted fvwm.

Now I get this error in ~/.xsession-errors:

| [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset '-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-101-100-100-c-0-iso8859-16', trying '-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'
| [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed][-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-101-100-100-c-0-iso8859-16]:The following charsets are missing:
|  ISO8859-2


I have to mention that I have all that *iso8859-16 fonts (for example I
can open an xterm with that font; xlsfont is also listing it).

Why I get those errors, and how can I use my fonts in fvwm?

I run Debian woody (3.0) and the fvwm version is 2.4.6-2.

On another systems I run fvwm 2.2.4-2 because I can't upgrade to
2.4.6-2. And the old version cause conflicts with xlibs, so each time
I use apt-get install or dselect to install new packages I have to
manually downgrade fvwm.

On the new system I can't downgrade fvwm because I don't have the
*.deb file for an older xlibs.

Please help me out with this error, so I can use fvwm 2.4.6-2 on all my
systems.


Thank you for your help.

Regards,
        Ionel

Dump the debian fvwm package, download the latest stable fvwm
tarball (fvwm-2.4.12) and build and install it locally without the
--enable-multibyte option when running configure.  Although multi
byte font support is marked as experimental in 2.4.x, several
distributions ship with multibyte enabled versions.

I'm having the same problem as Andre Bonhote on Red Hat 8.0:  I get
the following behavior:

[root@ext2 themes]# fvwm-themes-config --site --reset
Warning: unknown entry [t0c0], ignoring...
Incorrect line key value, not enough +'s

This happens with the fvwm-themes rpms from sourceforge, with ones
I've built form the tarball, and with installation directly from the
tarball.  A "grep -r t0c0" in the fvwm directory isn't showing
anything.  I'm using fvwm-2.4.12.  

I looked through the part of fvwm-themes-config where the warning is,
but my perl isn't good enough for me to know where to stick in some
useful debugging statements.  Any suggestions would be very welcome!
(I don't want to use Red Hat's metastasize WM!!)

I don't know whether I'm having trouble with fvwm-themes or it's having trouble 
with me.  I have the SuSE distro, which bundles 2.4.8.  It also bundles 
fvwm-themes.  The problem is that I get an error on star,  <<ERROR>> can't open 
display.

Does fvwm-themes look for fvwm2 or just fvwm?  I heard a while back that fvwm2 
was going to be renamed back to fvwm and if so, someone should tell SuSE that so 
  things that depend on having the program don't break.

Ok, after some tricky search I finally found what you have:

  http://www.suse.de/de/private/products/suse_linux/i386/packages_professional/index_all.html

They ship very old fvwm-themes-0.4.2, but it may work ok with fvwm-2.4.8
probably, I don't know.

You may install fvwm-themes-0.6.1 from sources, it works well with 2.4.8.
2.4.8 has both executable names fvwm and fvwm2, so don't worry about this.

Now, to your problem. Do you start fvwm-themes-start instead of startx or
xinit? See /usr/share/doc/packages/fvwm-themes/README .

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, that should work and it does for me.  I can't say much more
before I know the precise fvwm release number.  Posting your
complete FvwmButtons config won't hurt either.

FYI - the "-class" option of xterm is not implemented universally.  Not
supported on Solaris 7 and 8, for example.

Hello,

Could you please put the person in charge of your Business Development or Strategic Partnerships in touch with me?

I noticed on Download.com that you are promoting FVWM 2.2.2.  We have a potential proposal that may allow you to generate revenue with every copy of your software that is downloaded.

If you are interested in this, I can give you more specifics including payment details.  I'll need to know approximately how many downloads of your application you are getting each day and any other titles you might have along with approximate downloads per day for those, as well.

We also have the ability to generate downloads of your software on a small per download fee if this is something that interests you.  I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,

J. Beck

Ok, after some debugging, I see what happens. And what I see is pretty
oppressing. With unicode locale and perl-5.8.0, but not perl-5.6.0, the
first lc("theme") returns "t0c0".

This is weird, because: 1) the same lc("theme") returns "theme" later,
2) I can't create a minimal perl script reproducing this problem,
3) I can't see how lc("theme") may become "t0c0" even with unicode.

My current hypothesis is a bug in perl-5.8.0, I am checking this.

Anyway, here is a workaround. Replace "lc($1)" with "$1" in
fvwm-themes-config[.in]. Another possibility is to run under older perl
or under non-unicode locale, so the following should work:

  env LANG=C make install

I can't guarantee that the rest will work though (try it) if there is
such fundamental bug.

Regards,
Mikhael.

hello people :)

i have a few stupid functions that i like in my config files:

AddToFunc "Wheel-goes-up"
+ D WindowShade True

AddToFunc "Wheel-goes-down"
+ D WindowShade False

Mouse 4 T N Wheel-goes-up
Mouse 5 T N Wheel-goes-down

after a few minutes after starting fvwm, these no longer work, in fact the 
only way i can make them work is by left-clicking the titlebar then it works 
for one iteration, eg left-clcik titlebar, roll mouse wheel twice and it 
works, but id have to click it again to do it again, this has only happened 
the last few days and i have no idea what i changed or how to fix it, plz 
help!

linux 2.4.19
fvwm 2.4.12
fvwm-themes 0.6.1

I use Xt resource-setting arguments, like "-xrm '*Desk: 1'".  See the
FVWM man page for details.

Hmm, sounds like a bug in the pager.  But I don't use the pager, so
I'm not sure.

Hello,

I'm using 2.5.2 . My config (the bits I think are relevant) is:

Style BarButtons  NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip,\
                    BorderWidth 4, CirculateSkip, StaysOnTop
Style SubPanel  NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip,\
                    BorderWidth 4, CirculateSkip, StaysOnTop

DestroyModuleConfig BarButtons: *
*BarButtons: Fore Black
*BarButtons: BoxSize smart
*BarButtons: Back #c3c3c3
*BarButtons: Frame 1
*BarButtons: Pixmap none


*BarButtons: Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*BarButtons: Geometry 30x30-5+0@0
*SubPanel: Columns 1

*BarButtons: (Panel(left, delay 0, steps 4, position 100 270p) SubPanel
"Module FvwmButtons SubPanel") Icon mini.penguin.xpm

*SubPanel: (1x10 Swallow (NoClose, UseOld) licq 'Exec licq -p qt-gui&')
*SubPanel: Geometry 150x500-100+100
*SubPanel: (Swallow XClock 'Exec xclock -bg navy -fg white -digital

-update 1 -jumpscroll 1 -label "CPU Load" &')
*SubPanel: (1x4 Swallow FvwmPager "FvwmPager 0 3")


I want the icon to appear in the top right of my second monitor (which I
believe should be referred to as 1), but for some reason I can only get
it to work if I put 0 in the geometry spec and make sure the pointer is
in screen 0 when FVWM (re)starts.

Any ideas?

Cheers,

Andy

Okay, that did the trick.  I ended up modifying startx and calling it something 
else, so I don't need to go editing .xinitrc every time I want to do something. 
  I hope your docs explain how to take one's present .fvwm2rc and modify it to suit.

See FAQ #0.1.

Also I would change "N" to "A", so it works with NumLock pressed too.

I will probably add this to the default fvwm-themes bindings.

An argument like "-xrm '*Desk: 1'" will cause an application
to start on a different desk, but it won't put a different picture
on the background for each desktop.  For that, you need FvwmBacker.
Try it, I don't think its that complicated.

Well, "xvirtualroot -xrm '*Desk: 2 0 1' -f bg.xpm &" does what is needed.

Not that I advocate setting a background using permanent xvirtualroot
windows instead of FvwmBacker module together with fvwm-root or
fvwm-themes-images utilities. But this is an acceptable solution.

I see one advantage to xvirtualroot, it may be a bit faster as compared to
FvwmBacker that always recalculates the image. One of disadvantages is
that half transparent png icons look not very good on such virtual root
and are slow. (This is only relevant for fvwm-2.5.x, of course.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

I would add:

  Style XVirtualRoot SkipMapping, FixedPosition, FixedSize

The last 2 are only for 2.5.x.

It seems there is a bug in FvwmPager regarding initial drawing of windows
on lower layers.

In 2.5.x you may hide xvirtualroot in pager completely using:

  *FvwmPager: UseSkipList

Oops.  Sorry, looking back thru the archive, I can see that I
wasn't paying attention to this xvirtualroot thingie.

I used these options:

Style XVirtualRoot CirculateSkip, StaysOnBottom, NeverFocus, NoTitle, NoHandles
Style XVirtualRoot WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0, StartsLowered
Style XVirtualRoot SkipMapping, FixedPosition, FixedSize

but I still got a placement outline.  Did I miss an option?

I couldn't move or resize the window.  My root mouse and keybindings
worked.  But I could Delete, Destroy, or windowshade the window by selecting
the command from a menu.  Thats sort of odd, since I can't
focus it, but I guess that makes some sense.

It doesn't cooperate with xaniroc.
The mouse pointer doesn't change to the root pointer either
(makes sense).

Yes, this should be added:

  Style XVirtualRoot CascadePlacement

> I couldn't move or resize the window.

Adding FixedPosition makes sence only after everything works ok.

I think it is ok, maybe an option to disallow WindowShade would be good.

> It doesn't cooperate with xaniroc.

Well, this is xaniroc problem, it could be more configurable and
accept window id option to work with any window, not just root.
Then xaniroc would work with "xvirtualroot -w" id.

I don't know whether it is possible to tell X just to duplicate
(dynamically) the root cursor to another window.

Mikhael.

Tim can you try the next snapshot?

Now your video card should be auto-detected and 24 bits colors should
be used by default (no -visual{Id} option). Does this work? I hope
that the icons in your FvwmButtons are ok now.

So now for using 8 bits colors you should use -visual PseudoColor
(no progress here for your FvwmButtons icons).

This works all fine for me.  Please post your whole configuration
file as well as your exact Xinerama configuration (exact screen
geometries).  Also, apply the attached patch:

  $ cd fvwm/modules/FvwmButtons
  $ patch < path_to_patch_file/fb.patch

and post the output you get when the problem occurs.

There is always an infinitive number of desktops in FVWM.
You may refer to them from, say, -1000 to 1000 in commands like GotoDesk,
MovoToDesk.

You may change the number of pages each desktop has using this command:

  DesktopSize 2 3

To start FvwmPager with 4 desktops shown, numbered from 0 to 3, replace
this or similar line:

  FvwmPager * *

with:

  FvwmPager 0 3

Mikhael.

INI files?

The command you are looking for is DesktopSize.

Well, I meant I will add a configurable support for a mouse wheel, not
just that specific bindings, but if you contribute something interesting,
you will be in ChangeLog, why not? :)

OK, got snap-20021015 and ran it without the -visual[Id].  The colors
still look 8-bit'ish (overly gray).  I'll attach a pic.

Come to think of it - I can very easily live with the '-visual'
option if you have more important things to do (I certainly don't
mean to complicate anyone's life and am totally satisfied using
the now functional & reasonable '-visual' option).  It doesn't sounds
like those dual colormap video cards are common enough to warrant
your headache and efforts (just a thought).  Have a more reasonable
8-bit colormap selection and call it quits on this issue :-)

Thanks.

With both snap-20021010 and snap-20021015 I've noticed that transients
(well netscape's "Open Page" -- CTRL-O specifically) seems to flicker
badly (twice I think) upon bring-up.  There were no changes to the
.fvwm2rc file, the only mention of anything related to transients is,

  Style "*" MouseFocus, GrabFocusTransient
  Style "*" MWMFunctions, MWMDecor
  Style "*" Color White/DimGray, WindowListSkip, NoHandles,
            DecorateTransient, BorderWidth 3

Where there any changes in that realm or am I doing something wrong ?

Thanks.

And with the -visualId which gives you 24 bit colors is your
FvwmButtons icons ok? This is the more important things for me.

Yeah, they are fine with the '-visual TrueColor' option :-)  I'll
try the '-visualId' at a later point (and let you know in private),
but expect it will be fine as well.

Thanks.

Yes, there were changes.  I can't say much about that without

 * Knowing the exact netscape release.
 * A more precise description of "flickering".

Just out of curiosity:  why do you set the WIndowListSkip style on
*all* windows?  That seems pretty useless.

Hi,
I've got two questions about the WindowList I did not succeed to answer
with the man pages:

1.
Is it possible to make the WindowList sticky and use it instead of of
the IconMan? When I make it sticky it blocks all other activities untill
I click onto it  - then, however, it disappears. Is there another way to
use it like the IconMan?

2.
I tried to configure the WindowList in a way that Ctrl-Tab not only
raises the next window but also iconifies ALL other windows. That has
the desired effect that only one window is visible from time to time. I
tried this:

DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ I All Iconify On
+ I WindowId $0 Iconify Off
+ I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
+ I WindowId $0 Raise

My problem lies in "+ I All Iconify On". This also affects my IconMan,
XClock, Buttons which should NOT be iconified. (I have also excluded
them from the WindowList but this doesn't change anything.) Is there a
way to select all windows EXCEPT IconMan, XClock and Buttons? "All" is
too much,"WindowId $0" is not enough...

Thank You,
 Felix

No.  The WindowList is just a menu and behaves as such.

Add the CirculateSkip style to the windows you do not want to
affect:

  Style FvwmButtons CirculateSkip
  Style xclock CirculateSkip
  ...

Thanks but this doesn't help. :-)
If I use a WindowListFunc as shown above even with these Style commands
ALL is affected. I beleve that "All" is not the right thing but
"WindowId $0" isn't either... So, what else could I do to iconify all
windows except xclock, iconman, buttons...?

I see.  The "All" command disregards some of the condition flags.
I have committed a patch to the latest development code.  With
that, you can say

  Style blabla CirculateSkip

and then

  All (!CirculateHit) iconify on

I am funning FVWM on an embedded install of RedHat that utilizes a touch
screen and is using Mozilla as it's primary UI.  I am looking for a way to
disable the drag feature that most if not all window managers allow.

In mozilla a user has the ability to drag images out of pages and cause
major problems to the user-experience.

Thoughts anyone?

Yes.

I believe your problem has nothing to do with the window manager.
The only part of Fvwm that has anything to do with dragging that
I know about is FvwmDragWell which is an optional module which
I don't believe you are running.

I just dragged a Mozilla image, and it just flew back to where
it started.  I'm curious as to why thats a problem.

I think you might be able to disable drags by asking questions
on the Mozilla lists.

I'm using Netscape-4.75 (I know its archaic) on a,

  uname -a: SunOS pez 5.7 Generic_106541-08 sun4u

In terms of this flickering (and it happens on all transient windows,
ALT-F (netscape's find) does it as well); the window pops-up and gets
raised and focused, then it seems as though it attempts to raise itself
one more time which end-up looking as though its a flicker.  In essence,
it redraws itself twice before becoming available.  Hope that helps.
Let me know if you want me to run any debug code.

I use FvwmWinList (reminds me of my old tvtwm days :-) and would only
like to list xterms (and alike) and so I also have the following entries
in my .fvwm2rc file

  Style "xterm"   Color white/gray64, NoIcon, WindowListHit
  Style "rxvt"    Color white/gray64, NoIcon, WindowListHit
  Style "mlterm"  Color white/gray64, NoIcon, WindowListHit
  Style "emacs"   NoIcon, WindowListHit

Thanks (do please CC)

Are there any plans to add support for multi-headed Systems to FVWM?

I currently use one fvwm for each display, but what I would really like is
to be able to move windows between the displays.. e.g. by dragging them on the
screen or in the pager..

Any plans on doing something like that?

     Tilo

P.S.: Macs can do that for the last +15 years now..

Try the 2.5.x betas.  Check the man page for Xinerama.
I notice sun.com in your email address.
If you are going to try this on a Sun, you're going to have
a problem, right now, only XFree86 is supported.
If you'd like to help get Fvwm Xinerama support working
on Solaris, I'm sure someone at fvwm-workers@fvwm.org will

Very correct....

It's not a problem, but a feature. When you compile Mozilla with GTK
toolkit, you can then drag any image or component to GTK compiled
application. Typically, you'd drag the image to the gimp for example.

I think Mozilla lists advice would be to recompile...

This is very much inside GTK code. You need to check with the GTK
people. Check first your mozilla bin from RedHat was compiled with
GTK.

Add "CursorStyle ROOT None" to your config file for removing the
root cursor. You can remove the cursor for others context in the
same way, see the fvwm man page.

No, fvwm does not have this feature.  It is possible to achieve a
similar effect with a bit of scripting.  But it is so inefficient
that I do not want to recommend it.  Currently, there are no plans
to add such a feature.

I don't understand.

Are you clicking on a window or an icon?

If on the window, where on the window.
The areas of a window are the window itself, the frame, the corner
handles, the title bar, and the titlebar buttons.

What do you mean by Popup?  Is it a menu?  What does it say.

Hello,

I want my fvwm to give new windows the focus automaticlly.
That means if I e.g. start a new xterm this xterm should get
the focus. I am using SloppyFocus.
How can I change my config to behave like this ?

Regards, j.m.

Hi all

I'd recently updated my debian/stable. After that, when I login to xdm,
the wm is blackbox. I want to switch to fvwm, but I don't know how. How
can I force to start fvwm?

TIA

Globally as root:

# update-alternatives --config x-window-manager

Then select /usr/bin/fvwm2 as the one with the highest priority.

As a regular user:

Check where fvwm2 is installed:

$ type fvwm2
fvwm2 is /usr/bin/fvwm2

Edit $HOME/.xsession like that:

$ cd
$ cp .xsession .xsession.old
$ echo '#!/bin/sh' > .xsession
$ echo 'exec /usr/bin/fvwm2' >> .xsession
$ chmod 755 .xsession

If you are using xdm that's all. If you are using gdm, select Xsession as
the login session.

2.4.6 is pretty old, 2.4.12 is current.  It may help to try it.

During the configure step, configure checks for
an install program using the names:

ginstall scoinst install

if they don't work correctly, it should use "install_sh".

on Solaris, it should use "install_sh".

During configure I get a message like this:

checking for a BSD-compatible install... ./install-sh -c

You should do:

which ginstall
which scoinst
which install

to see what you have on the machine.

Then rerun configure and see if you can tell what is happening
when it looks for install.

Ok, 

GrabFocus works but it excludes SloppyFocus.
I want both: first GrabFocus then SloppyFocus.
This does  not work:

Style * GrabFocus, SloppyFocus

Any ideas?

Regards, j.m.

Please explain what you want by giving some examples.
You can't have both at the same time unless you also warp the pointer,
in this case, see FAQ #3.18.

Hello,

sorry if I'd missed a reference to this, but...

I just installed RH 8.0, which meant I could look at
antialiasing support, which meant I figured it was worth to
build a 2.5.x :) So I did.

Is there any doc that someone can point me to, that
describes new things in 2.5.x I could play with?

thanks,

denis

I just did this yesterday... took me 20 minutes to find the part in the
man page about it. If you ask me, the section in the man page about the
Style option should have specific info on what each style does. As it is
now, they're all scattered throughout the manpage(s).

anyway...

SloppyFocus automatically does a GrabFocusOff, so you HAVE to put
GrabFocus AFTER SloppyFocus.

like:
Style * SloppyFocus
Style * GrabFocus


hope this helps,
Peter McAlpine

In general, SloppyFocus and GrabFocus work together, but there are
soe situations when the focus is taken away immediately.  There is
little you can do except changing the focus policy for such
applications

Um, I have both at the same time, and my pointer doesn't warp. By doing:
Style * SloppyFocus
Style * GrabFocus

new windows gain focus, and the mouse doesn't focus anything until it
moves (onto another window?).

Cheers,
Peter McAlpine

Hello,

No biggy here but I was wondering how I can force Evolution to use a
certain Icon. I put

Style evolution Icon evolution.png, MiniIcon envelope.png

in my .fvwm2rc file and it works fine right after I start Evolution.
However, when I switch directories in my inbox it will start to use the
app supplied icon (which is a tiny 16x16 icon).

FvwmIdent shows a resource string of "evolution" for most evolution
windows while the Name and IconName changes depending on what window I
look at. I tried using wildcards like "Evolution*" or "*volution*" but
that doesn't make any difference.

Thanks for any pointers

Ben

Yes, of course, you can do this. But then you get a modified SloppyFocus.
I.e. the pointer may be in the unfocussed window for some time (i.e. it is
not really SloppyFocus now). This is what I meant when asked to describe
what is the desired behaviour.

And you are right, the following can't work in 2.4.x:

  Style * GrabFocus, SloppyFocus

because SloppyFocus implies GrabFocusOff. But this works in 2.5.3+.

The following works in 2.4.x:

  Style * SloppyFocus, GrabFocus

Mikhael.

Try:

  Style evolution IconOverride

You probably mean the mini icon that is supplied, so try also:

  Style evolution EWMHMiniIconOverride

Actually the MiniIcon I specified never changed. So I guess there is no
app supplied MiniIcon (the app supplied icon is just really small).

Style evolution IconOverride

worked.

Just tried this one, seems to work alright. I'm using emacs version
20.7, and I had to comment out line 150:

      (set-keymap-name map  "Fvwm")

but now she works just fine, thank you very much.

Okay. When I open a new application e.g. xterm 
I want it to get the focus even if the mouse pointer is not over it. 
(i have got a big screen with lot of space)
If I then open rxvt it should get the focus instead (even if the mouse is not over it).
And from now on I want both applications to behave like in
the  SloppyFocus mode. (that means last active window keeps active
until i move the pointer/mouse in another window).

But as far as I understand the FAQ this is only possible by using
a funktion for each programm.

Regards,
	Jodok

Hi all,

Is there a way to highlight the active fg menu item without having to
highlight the bg of the active menu item?

This highlights the fg in AntiqueWhite (which is what I want) & the
background in a horrible green:

ImagePath $HOME/images/icons
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 255 2 darkgray 50 MidnightBlue 50 white
MenuStyle * SidePic happy.xpm
MenuStyle * ActiveFore AntiqueWhite
MenuStyle * HilightBack green

If I comment out the HilightBack line, then there is no bg (obviously)
but also no AntiqueWhite on the active menu item ...

What I really want is the AntiqueWhite fg & my menuface gradient to
still be visible in the bg.

I'm using 2.5.3 on RH7.3.

Thanks for any help,

SCoTT. :)

Hi all,

I have a Kiosk running fvwm. The Kiosk has a browser and an TCL/TK 
application running. I need to toggle the windows programatically on 
certain events.  Basically, I want the monitor to display the browser 
window and the Tck/Tk window alternatively. Is there any way to do this ?

Thanks
rahul

Yes, you may do this. I give you some commands that may be called from
FvwmEvent or FvwmCommand or be bound to key presses and you choose what
you need. Please contact the man pages to learn more.

  Next Raise
	- raise the next window

  Next Focus
	- focus the next window

  Next WindowListFunc $w
	- go to the next window (raise/warp/focus)

  Next ("Browser") Focus
	- focus browser window (replace the id string with "Netscape*")

  Next ("Browser") WindowListFunc $w
	- go to browser window (raise/warp/focus) 

  Current ("Browser") Next ("Application") Focus
	- focus application window if currently browser is focused

There more conditionals and options like "ThisWindow (Raised, !Focused)"
depending on your fvwm version.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I was defining 4Dwm-like buttons.

So a maximise button would look something like this (presuming you have
fixed font, run pine :-))

  #############
  #           ##
  #           ##
  #           ##
  #           ##
  ##############
   #############

I don't find a way to do this properly, since those "offsets" should be a
fixed distance (1 pixel).

I made the following definitions:

ButtonStyle 1 3 23x58@2 77x58@2 77x42@2 
AddButtonStyle 1 3 23x58@2 23x42@2 77x42@2
AddButtonStyle 1 3 82x47@2 82x60@2 28x60@2
ButtonStyle 2 3 20x75@2 75x75@2 75x20@2
AddButtonStyle 2 3 20x75@2 20x20@2 75x20@2	
AddButtonStyle 2 3 80x30@2 80x80@2 30x80@2
ButtonStyle 4 3 42x58@2 58x58@2 58x42@2 
AddButtonStyle 4 3 42x58@2 42x42@2 58x42@2
AddButtonStyle 4 3 61x47@2 61x61@2 47x61@

This works well for a certain title bar size.

I guess I could write a script that calculates theese according to font
size, but it seems a bit teedious.

Is there a better way of doing it?

I would suggest having some option to add an offset to vector definitions.
Like for example:

AddButtonStyle 1 3 23+1x58+1@2 23x42@2 77-1x42@2
Where (+1 and -1 is offsets). (Note that these doesn't nessesarily give
a portion of the above button, I just made it up...)

You can't do this. The only current possibility is to have a solid
active background if it is different from the main background.

What you really want is to have a transparent ActiveColorset, but it
is not currently implemented.

Hopefully someone (Olivier) will enhance the menu ActiveColorset to be
fully functional, including Pixmap and Transparent options.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, this is the only current possibility, write a script.
Or use (transparent) images.

This is a good idea, that works mostly with offsets -1 and +1.

Another idea that would create a more proportional look is to be able
to fill recangles, not just draw lines, like:

  42x58@1 r58x42@1

Anyway, until someone implements one or another idea, you can't do much.

Actually in fvwm 1.x this was the ONLY way to define buttons:
Like: (taken from a sample .fvwmrc for 1.24)

ButtonStyle 1 50x22
ButtonStyle 2 50x50
ButtonStyle 4 22x22

They were always rectabgles shaded implicitly

Hello,

I am trying to make my .fvwm2 config file work for both
2.5.x and 2.4x

In addition, depending on which machine I log in from, I
want to run 2.5.x or 2.4.x

In my fvwm2rc,I have things like ModulePath, which change
depending on which version I am running.

The only way I am aware of is to use $[FVWM_VERSION] and set
that version sometime before fvwm starts.

Also, I wanted to keep various parts of my config file in
different files. Is it possible to say something like :

source .fvwm.menues (or something)

and have that file included?

Also, is it possible to have conditional expressions in
fvwmrc, where i define something or other based on some
setting?

denis

The fvwm variable $v contains the version.

Using PipeRead, you can do any kind of conditional statement.

For example, if you did:

PipeRead "shellcommand $v"

then shell command would be passed the Fvwm version string.
For the 2.5.4 release I'm running, that contains:

fvwm 2.5.4 (from cvs) compiled on Oct 18 2002 at 07:12:03

Anything printed by the shell command would be treated as
an Fvwm command.

Please remove ModulePath line completely. Don't comment it, just remove.
ModulePath is needed in neither 2.5.x nor 2.4.x (nor 2.2.x).

  Read menus  # this will include in ~/.fvwm/menus

  PipeRead "echo Read .fvwm2rc-`fvwm-config --version | cut -c1-3`"

The second includes either .fvwm2rc-2.4 or .fvwm2rc-2.5 depending
on version.

Mostly using this PipeRead technique.

The way I do this at uni is by having one configuration for each machine:

yallara [11:26am] [~] ls -la .fvwm2rc*
-rw-------   1 izzo     students    7575 Oct  8 10:56 .fvwm2rc-numbat
-rw-------   1 izzo     students    7109 Oct  8 10:57 .fvwm2rc-yallara

Then my .xsession looks like this:

#!/bin/sh

# use correct config file depending on host

FOO=`hostname`
CONFIG=""

if [ $FOO = "yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au" ]; then
   CONFIG="$HOME/.fvwm2rc-yallara"
elif [ $FOO = "numbat.cs.rmit.edu.au" ]; then
   CONFIG="$HOME/.fvwm2rc-numbat"
fi

# start the window manager

exec fvwm2 -f $CONFIG

# eof

But you could of course use one of the other methods previously described;
they're probably more elegant. :-)

  Ok...here goes!

  I am totally new to FVWM.  I loaded FreeBSD the other day for a first
  time as well.  I have hardly any experience with anything but Windows.

  I loaded BSD and then loaded Gnome.  Had all sorts of problems so looked
  what else I could use as a WM and found FVWM.  Got it loaded and the
  default screen consists of:

  FVWM Icon Man Box, with a mail box in it and a clock and FVWM Butt. WWhat
  and where does one go from here?  Doesn't seem to be any 'first time
  user' info that I can see.

Fvwm doesn't supply as much hand-holding as Windows.
Use Gnome or KDE for that.

If you want something more elaborate than what you see so far,
but not as elaborate as Gnome or KDE, try fvwm-themes:

http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

If you just want to use Fvwm as is,
the configuration file is in:

$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

Look at it with an editor and read about the commands in the
man page.

Fvwm doesn't have a first time user guide.
Fvwm has so many commands that the developers are busy just
keeping the reference material up-to-date.

There are very good reasons to use Fvwm.
Fvwm is extremely configurable and consumes a lot less resources
than Gnome or KDE.

There are a few (possibly very old and outdated) .fvwm2rc files along with
some of the screenshots at www.fvwm.org, too.

I think I was under the impression that Gnome and KDE were different
animals than FVWM.  You can use window managers like FVWM and
Enlightenment under Gnome and KDE.  I personally think Gnome and KDE are
about as useful as Windows 3.1 was over DOS.  "Windows 3.x - a colourful
clown suit for DOS."  But I guess this is bordering on a rant.

Anyways, back to useful info for newbies, I found it most useful to get an
fvwm dot file from somebody and start editing it to see what happened.  If
you get one with a screenshot, it makes it that much easier to pick the
parts you like and change the parts you don't.

Hello,

2.5.4 (cvs) Fvwm:

is there any way to make windowlist switch between windows
back and forth on alt-tab. For example, here is what I am
using now:

Key Tab   A    M    WindowList (CurrentPage) NoGeometry, CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd

This makes it convenient to cycle through windows.
However, if i have windows a, b, c is it possible to go from
window a to window b by hitting alt-tab, and then back to
window a by hitting another alt-tab?

Holding alt and hitting tab repeatedly would then cycle
through the rest of the windows (it does so anyway)

thanks,

denis

Another newbie here...I've only had Linux up for about two weeks, but
fvwm2 works a lot more nicely with my P133 than KDE did.

Also, you can download other people's .fvwm2rc off of the internet, then
examine them.  I'm using a modified version of Don Knuth's, just 'cuz I
can. :-)

This is impossible. Window decorations do not even use colorsets yet.
Hopefully will in 2.6.0 or 3.0.0.

You should be using a not up to date cvs version, because the current
one does what you describe. This was broken two weeks ago (and in 2.5.3).

As something totally unrelated, you probably know that you may center
the window list menu:

  Key Tab   A    M    WindowList (CurrentPage) Root c c NoGeometry, CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd

or maybe even:

  Key Tab   A    M    WindowList (CurrentPage) Window c c NoGeometry, CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd

Hi

Recently my modem died, so I'm stuck with a winmodem 'til I get enough
money to get a _real_ modem.  I'd like to use CVS version of fvwm.  Is
there a way to get the CVS version (without cygwin, I don't plan on
having windows installed much longer), or does anyone have a tarball?

Thanks for any help.

You may use WinCVS, but it would be more convenient for you to just
download the daily snapshots from fvwm.org since you probably plan to
move the sources to another partition anyway.

I finally gave fvwm2 a decent shot a week ago, and have completely
fallen in love with it. It's taken quite the time commitment... but
you can take a look at a fresh screenshot of mine at:
http://www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/pitc-screenshot.jpg

My .fvwm2rc file (which isn't too too complicated... yet): ;)
http://www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/.fvwm2rc

The best first step that I made... read the first half of the fvwm2
man page. It was hard to actually have the patience, but it paid off
big time. Then I stumbled across:
http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/configs/

This girl has a pretty sweet config, and wrote a script "fvwm-theme"
that I use and love. NOTE: It's NOT the same thing as the fvwm-themes
project. I tried fvwm-themes, and didn't like it at all. It felt like
a whole new window manager, and I was just starting to get used to
vanilla fvwm. I use it for setting backgrounds and titlebar
pixmaps. It works nicely, but I HIGHLY recommend you read through it
first, and try to figure out how it works. Then try to do the same
thing by hand. That's the best way to learn if you ask me.

I tried fvwm on top of gnome, but it seemed to defeat the purpose of
it. Instead, I (sometimes, because I found I don't need them as much)
use gnome apps on top of fvwm. I like fvwm's speed and stability way
more than gnome's buggy UI's.

Also very cool is wmpinboard (bottom left of my screenshot). Everytime
I think of something that I want to tweak, I write myself a
note. Helps me to remember: "oh yeah, I wanted to figure out how to
use..."

Hmmm... hope this book I just wrote helps. I'll give you the website
I've been at the most in the last week: ;)
http://www.fvwm.org/generated/manpages/

Good luck and have fun,
Peter

Are you using the graphics from the default sawmill/sawfish setup?  Or is that
actually sawmill/sawfish running there? :-)

Ahh, this can be quite confusing.  :-)  You see, gnome in itself (along with
kde) isn't a window manager; basically it provides the gnome bar (there's a
desktop too but in a way that's not a gnome thing; it's just a standard
program - nautilus).  There isn't much point to running gnome by itself; you
really do need the window manager to get window decorations happening.  Gnome
doesn't do any window decorations.  When you say "gnome apps" probably what
you're talking about is gtk apps (which you can run under KDE too - it just
uses a different library to draw widgets etc).

Still, I imagine everything that gnome does with the gnome bar could easily
be done using fvwm.  When I get some time I'm going to have a go at doing
this as I would like to get rid of my gnome bar (I use it but it feels like
such a waste since I'm using little else gnome-related).

If anyone else can explain the whole gnome/kde/wm confoundedness or wants to
correct my explanations, please feel free, as I often still get confused with
the entire thing. :-)

Hi, 

I am a real newbie on fvwm and trying it with Cygwin/XFree86.  I am just
not able to figure out this simple behavior (at least it works in twm by
default) after reading and trying various things.  I am also not able to
find a search function in the mail archive so that I have to post the
question.  I will greatly appreciate your help.

Welcome.

Try to ask your questions in the message body, with more info supplied.

I guess you use one of the latest stable versions, please always specify
the version you use.

I guess you ask about FvwmIconMan that is your icon manager.

You may add something like this to your ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc:

  *FvwmIconMan: Action Mouse 1 N sendcommand "DeiconifyFocusAndRaise"
  *FvwmIconMan: Action Mouse 2 N sendcommand "Iconify"
  *FvwmIconMan: Action Mouse 3 N sendcommand "Popup WindowOps Mouse -102m c"

If you use FvwmWinList the syntax is a bit different:

  *FvwmWinList: Action Click1 DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  *FvwmWinList: Action Click2 Iconify
  *FvwmWinList: Action Click3 Popup WindowOps Mouse -102m c

Where DeiconifyFocusAndRaise is a defined function and WindowOps is a menu.

  DestroyFunc DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   DeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  + I Iconify off
  + I Focus
  + I Raise

See also the man pages fvwm(1) and FvwmIconMan(1).

Regards,
Mikhael.

I got the title bar pixmaps from the other site I mentioned:

But it is 100% pure fvwm. No sawfish at all. =)

thanks. I think you've told me once about that at some
point. I use it and like it, just temporarily took it out
while trying to figure out the behaviour business :-)

Also, just cvs update'd and rebuilt - still the same
problem.

Using the string just as you suggested, I get the following:

when I have 4 windows open: presently active 'mutt',
inactive FvwmConsole, '.fvwm2rc', and 'vim', and hit
alt-tab, and dont release it, first window is '.fvwm2rc'.
Mutt is now the very last window (probably due to
CurrentAtEnd). Now, I release my alt key, and I am switched
to '.fvwm2rc' window. all is good. 

Now, I repeat the process:
while holding alt-tab, first window is now 'vim', last is
'.fvwm2rc', and pre-last is 'mutt'. So, when I release my
alt, I am switched to console.

What I would like, is get switched back to mutt on my second
operation.

It seems to behave consistently with what I would expect
from CurrentAtEnd, so perhaps this is not really the option
I am looking for? I tried playing with ReverseOrder as well
to chieve the behavior, but can't quite get it.

Please let me know if I am not being clear enough.

sorry to take up your time with this, but I found another
thread on the subject. You emailed the patch out to fix
this. Is it possible that it did not get propagated into
cvs?

      Subject: Re: FVWM: alt-tab

Andrei, original poster in that thread, reported that it
worked as desired after patch application. If you think it
has been applied, I will go and try to figure out what's
going on.

I will take my 2.5.x questions to fvwm-workers after this
email, I promise ;).

thanks.

Probably we use different cvs repositories or something like this. :)
It got propagated for me and both FlipFocus and WindowList work well.

2002-10-06  Dominik Vogt  <dominik.vogt@gmx.de>

	* fvwm/focus.c (__update_windowlist):
	(__set_focus_to_fwin):
	fixed reversal of __update_windowlist arguments causing FlipFocus to
	break [and maybe other things]

If you see this entry in ChangeLog and still have problems with
WindowList, rereport the problems with the reproduction directions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, I am an idiot. For the benefit of others who may come
accross the same problem: 

   AddToFunc WindowListFunc
   + "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
   + "I" WindowId $0 FlipFocus
   + "I" WindowId $0 Raise
   + "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

In the above function I used to have "Focus", not
"FlipFocus" and things did not work. Now it works. 

YEEEAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!

thanks :-)

Is fvwm-root a component of 2.5.* ? I don't find it in 2.4.11.

Using xvirtualroot:

*FvwmBacker: Command (Desk *) Function ChangeDesk
DestroyFunc ChangeDesk
AddToFunc ChangeDesk
+ I Exec xvirtualroot -f $[HOME]/.fvwm/$$d.xpm

the problem is that I don't know how to kill a previous root window. 
I get more and more root windows, and they are all hidden behind the 
first.

Will have to check out themes next.

I have fixed this.  With the latest code from CVS it should work
fine.  When using an ActiveColorset, you have to specifiy

  MenuStyle * HilightBackOff, ActiveFore, ActiveColorset <n>

The point of xvirtualroot is to avoid having to use FvwmBacker.  Start
one xvirtualroot window per desktop at startup, with the appropriate
-xrm '*Desk: n' parameter and the appropriate FVWM style settings, and
then the background will be different for each desktop automatically.

Or, just start one xvirtualroot window for all desktops, if you want
the same background on all desktops.

Use "xv -root ..." or equivilent to change the background image if
desired.

Since xvirtualroot is just another X window, the background image that
it provides appears much more quickly than a FvwmBacker-invoked
background when changing desktops.  Typically FvwmBacker causes the
image to be reread/recalculated/redrawn on each desktop change, which
makes for a less-than-smooth transition.

Is not it in your $PATH together with other fvwm-* utilities?

With 2.4.8+ after "make install" fvwm-root gets installed in the same bin
directory as fvwm. The old executable names for fvwm-root and fvwm get
installed too, but you may start to use the new names.

Mikhael.

Hello,

This is a section from my .bashrc:
(excuse messy code - it's one of those 'under constant tweaking' things)

-------------------
function lastcommand() {
     TEST=`history 2 2>&1|tail -n1|sed -e "s/\ *[0-9]*\ *//"`
     TEST2="(`whoami`@`hostname|cut -d'.' -f1`): $TEST"
     echo -n "$TEST2 [`pwd`]"
     return;
}

export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -en "\033]0;`lastcommand`\007"';
===============

This gives you a title bar that updates after each command is executed
and shows :
(<username>@<hostname>): <last executed command> [<current directory]

Looks like it should be a mess, but it's actually perfectly usable and
makes finding the correct xterm in the windowlist much easier.

If you make any useful improvements to the idea I'd be interested to
know about them.

Cheers,

Andy

I've noticed in a lot of screenshots that some people make use of a
"minature xterm" as a sort of dockable applet.  Where can I find it?

On second thought, that doesn't sound very descriptive... here's a link to
a screen shot that is using it in the upper left hand corner, bottom-most
app.

It is an ordinary xterm, you don't need a dockable applet of it.

If you know how to swalow applets, you know how to swalow xterm, just
give it an unique name, like "Exec exec xterm +sb -name XTermToSwalow".

Mikhael.

Andy,

How interesting. I was trying to do a lastcommand thing at
some point. But I could come up with nothing better then
sync my history with current and then parse that. But your
solution seems like it'd be much faster as it doe snot sync
the history...

Is this slow, or does it work well? If so, I'll steal this
from you :-)

thanks.

Prompt strings can also contain cursor movement commands.
You could have an extra prompt string displayed at the top or bottom
of the window, even without using the border. Browsing with google,
i think i've seen that kind of thing, and the background colour of
these strings can be changed which makes it look better.

Hey,

Logic dictates that there must be a performance penalty involved in
using this function as opposed to not using it, but on my 1Ghz Duron
there is no noticable effect at all. I expect there are more efficient
ways to do some of the things I'm doing if it were really necessary.

If you are going to use it, you might want to put an 'if' around the
export to stop the PROMPTCMD getting set when you're in a normal console
(ie, not an xterm), otherwise you end up with a line of crap getting
printed before your prompt.

Steal away ;)

Cheers,

Andy

A very recent change to menustyle.c (cvs version 1.18) causes fvwm to segfault if menus are being drawn with the default font.  It looks like it was just an accidental deletion of a code snippet, this patch puts it back.

That'd be mine. It's not a separate program, just aterm (rxvt or xterm would
work too) run with special options (tiny geometry, tiny font, etc.) and
started in InitFunction.

hi,

I'm wondering about getting my terms to be transparent. I use
gnome-terminal (but have no problem using xterm if it works better),
and when I set the background to transparent, it's just black. I use
qiv to set my background, and I heard that it sets the background by
just making a window the size of the screen, which may be fooling
gnome-terminal... anyway... what's the easiest (and I suppose most
fvwm P.C.) way to set the background? And after I do that, what steps
need to be taken to set up transparency on my terms?

-Peter

Remember this part I sent you the other day?

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec Esetroot -f /usr/share/pixmaps/vpm_wp_01_1024.jpg &
+ I Exec Eterm -g 26x21+0+552 -F 5x7 -O -T XMessages -e tail -f $HOME/.X.err

That's what I use.  Esetroot to set the background image and an Eterm with
the -O option (man Eterm gives an explanation).
It's really a pseudo-transparency, but it works well enough for this.
I think aterm also has a transparency option.

That reminds me, though...
I guess I should go ahead and ask the mailing list the stupid question of
How can I make this particular instance of Eterm appear with no titles?
I want the other Eterms to have the normal decorations, but I'd like THIS
instance to be NoTitle, NoHandles, etc.

You don't need the double quotes unless the name contains
whitespace.

Yes, that is xmms' fault.  It forces its window on screen no
matter what the user wants.  Don't hesitate to bother the xmms
developers with yet another bug report.  Maybe one day they will
regain their senses.  Xmms is the application that causes the most
"bug" reports on this list.

Anyway, with the latest (very unstable) fvwm-2.5.x version you can
prevent xmms from moving its windows:

  Style XMMS StartsOnPage 0 0 2, SkipMapping, FixedPPosition

(Actually, xmms was one of the main reasons why I made the
FixedPPosition style).

Bye

I may have misunderstood the question, but isn't one way to use the
"name" option, assuming term has it or something similar.

eg for rxvt

rxvt  -bg midnightblue -fg cornflowerblue -fn 10x20 +sb -name gterm

Put this wherever you want it in your key or menu sections. 

Then you can set style options for gterm. 


Style "gterm" notitle,  nohandles, BorderWidth 3, HandleWidth 3

or whatever!!

man fvwm2 did not tell me much about FixedPPosition - what
does that do?

Also, I have this problem .. I do smart placement of my
windows, and when I place xmms, it behaves weirdly: first a
little 4-arrow cursor appears (sort of like the cross),
which I must click, and only then does the xmms outline
appear which I can place. Have you come accross this
problem?  As this does not happen with anything else I use,
I am not willing to blame it on fvwm :), but maybe you
happened to come accross some workaround for this?

Hi.

Use Eterm's -title switch to uniquely identify the particular window, then use
a style line like:

Style "foo" NoTitle, Sticky, NoHandles, etc...

Line to specify that one term.

Have fun.

I got my fvwm2 installation from fink (package manager on Mac OS X). 
I'll contact the maintainer about this.

Style options seem to be ORred together. That means that if I reread 
my rc file after editing out some option I don't get rid of it. Is 
there a style analogon to DestroyFunc and such? Can I zero out all 
styles at the top of the file?

Victor,

I figured this out.

The fvwm project is in the process of converting the main name of their
executable from fvwm2 to fvwm, and there are some other name changes,
including a change from xpmroot to fvwm-root.

I have not followed this change in the fink packages, because when I first set
the fink packages up, I followed the example from the Debian project and
constructed a setup which allows the original fvwm (fvwm1) and fvwm2 to be
installed simultaneously.  This recent conversion process at the fvwm project
would break my setup, so I have been disabling it by using a flag they provide
(NEW_NAME_SYMLINKS=false).  This is why you are not finding fvwm-root: it is
actually called xpmroot, it's old name.

You may DestroyStyle *, but this is not recommended.

All style options without exceptions have their opposites, so you may undo
any style option on the fly. But, of course, the Style line order matters.

Just open the man page and search (using "/" key) for the style option
that you want to undo, you will see an opposite style option.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all,

I am using  Style "MyGUI*" Desk 1in my system.fvwm2.rc  to start my 
Tck/Tk application on desk 1. The UI is about 800x600 in size. I want to 
postion it at the center of the screen which is of size 1024x768. By 
default the application window always with  (0,0) as its left top 
corner. How do I specify the (x,y) postion of its left top corner?  My 
application doesnot provide the geometry option. I would like fvwm to 
launch all windows of name "MyGUI" at a specfic place ?

Thanks in advance for any tip.

rahul

This is the current feature, nested $[] are not allowed, so effectivelly
the first variable inside $[] is not expanded, but all others are ok.
This is because $[pict-0-$[page.nx] is considered as one $[] variable.

Generally, the rule is: only valid and currently defined $[var.name] are
expanded by fvwm, all other $[] strings are left as is.

Anyway, if you add additional dollar at the beginning:

  Echo $$[pict-0-$[page.nx]-$[page.ny]]

it will be expanded as you want (I hope so, because you didn't say what
you want to get):

  [FVWM][Echo]:  $[pict-0-2-3]

Actually, then I want *that* to be expanded. I guess I can do that 
with a two-step process.

What I want is first to

SetEnv pict-$$d-$[page.nx]-$[page.ny] 1

(that works, I tried)
and then be able to test it in

Exec if [ $[pict-$$d-$[page.nx]-$[page.ny]] -ne 1 ] ; then 
xvirtualroot -f <picture for this desk and page>


Ultimate goal: integrate FvwmBacker & xvirtualroot to get background 
picture per desktop & maybe per page. Something like

*FvwmBacker: Command (Desk *,Page * *) Function ChangeDesk
DestroyFunc ChangeDesk
AddToFunc ChangeDesk
+ I Exec if [ $[pict-$$d-$[page.nx]-$[page.ny]] -ne 1 ] ;
              then xvirtualroot -f   $[HOME]/.fvwm/$$d.xpm
                              -xrm "*Desk: $$d $[page.nx] $[page.ny]" ; fi
+ I SetEnv pict-$$d-$[page.nx]-$[page.ny] 1

Please see FAQ #3.18 and FAQ #7.14.

They explain the best solutions currently possible.

All distributions that for some reason want to continue to provide the
long time unsupported fvwm-1.24r version are encouraged to use "fvwm1"
as the package and the executable names.

Ok, I see now what you want. There are 2 problems with the above.

A shell variable can't have a dash in their name, so replace it with
underscore: pict_$$d_$[page.nx]_$[page.ny]

Now, leave some work to a shell, if you already do Exec. Like:

  Exec if [ "$$pict_$$d_$[page.nx]_$[page.ny]" -ne 1 ]; then bla-bla; fi

The shell then receives this:

  if [ "$pict_1_2_3" -ne 1 ]; then bla-bla; fi

  FixedPPosition and FixedPSize make fvwm ignore attempts of the

I hope that is clear enough?  Better wordings are always welcome.

Two aside notes first:  it would be helpful to start a new mail
thread for a new topic.  That saves me some time managing my
notoriously overflowing inbox (200+ mails).  Just a friendly
request.  And please always mention which fvwm version you are
using.  From the rest of the thread it's not obvious to me wether
you are still using 2.4.x or have upgraded to 2.5.x.

The crosshair cursor indicates that fvwm needs a window to operate
on and asks the user to select one.  With your description, I get
no crosshair cursor.  Please send me your .fvwm2rc file and I will
try again.

Bye

Hello,

I'd like to run fvwm2 --version from my menu, and show
output.

Would I do this with using an xterm, or is there another,
better way of doing this?

Ideally, I'd love to have something that works like Identd:
when you click on the window it goes away.

thanks,

denis

Hello,

Is it possible (perhaps in 2.5.x series, if not in 2.4.x) to
NOT pass the placement click/keypress to the applications?

I did find the Click... options, but those seem to apply to
mouse only, and only to 'Focus'. Or are they supposed to
work for placement clicks/keypresses as well?

I am using the smartplacement style, and some windows go
away right after I place them, since I think placement
click/keypress (i hit enter sometimes) is passed to the app.

thanks,

denis

something like this would perhaps do good:
Exec exec xmessage `fvwm --version`

or (for a more brief string):
Exec exec xmessage `fvwm --version | awk '{print $1 " " $3;}' | head -1`

There is some option for xmessage that might be interesting, see the
man-page

Hi!

How does one use the Conditional Commands to select a particular window ?

The only thing that I've been able to get working is WindowId, by explicitly
specifying the window id in this fashion...

Key F10 A M WindowID 0x280000e Iconify toggle

But I just can't figure out how to get it going using window titles with any
of the other commands 

Key F10 A M Any (CurrentDesk, Mutt) Iconify toggle

Key F10 A M Any (CurrentDesk, "Mutt") Iconify toggle

etc have no effect whatsoever.

I guess I'm missing something very basic out here.(I'm using the CVS version
... couldn't wait till 2.5.4 was released before I could use the tinting
effects! :o)

Also is there any way to get windowID of a running window using the window
title ?

Kingsly

Sure enough, that was a stupid question.
The answer was obvious after it was presented to me.  Shoulda figured that
out on my own.
Thanks so much!
(It worked.  I already had the -T option specified in Eterm even.
Sheesh.)

I think the intention is to never pass the placement clicks/keypresses to
an application regardless of any style options.

Denis, this is the second time you say you use SmartPlacement (BTW, it is
better to avoid this obsolete name and use the MinOverlapPlacement name)
when you actually use ManualPlacement. Please be more attentive.

I can't reproduce the problem with this config:

  Style ManuallyPlacedXTerm ManualPlacement
  Exec xterm -name ManuallyPlacedXTerm

Pressing Enter to place this xterm is not passed to it.
Probably you use something like "Exec xterm -e date" and "date" or other
similar command exits immediatelly, so xterm exits too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You should use either "All" or "Next", not "Any".

It will be released once the recent bug fixes are at least tested for some
days.

It is tricky, but possible. From a shell:

  % xwininfo -name "FvwmConsole" | grep "Window id" | cut -d" " -f4

Well, I would use either

  Exec exec xmessage '$v'

or:

  Exec exec gdialog --msgbox "fvwm `fvwm-config --version`" 100 100

Specifically, the "Any" command is broken and works like "None".
In any case, it wouldn't do what you want here.  The action of the
"Any" command is executed if a window exists that matches the
conditions.  But it is executed outside of any window context, so
"Iconify" would ask you to select a window.  What you want is

  Key F10 A M Next (CurrentDesk, mutt) Iconify toggle

or

  Key F10 A M All (CurrentDesk, mutt) Iconify toggle

> Also is there any way to get windowID of a running window using the window
> title ?

Yes.  The "$w" variable is expanded to the WindowId of the
current context window.  For example,

  Next (mutt) echo $w

prints the window id of the next window with the
title/class/resource "mutt".

No, that can't be it.  When you have to place a window manually,
the window is not even mapped an can not receive key or button
presses.  I'd have to see the effect myself to see what is going
on.  Please make a minimal .fvwm2rc and give detailed
instructions.

Why such an effort for a release marked as "experimental
unstable"?  Things will stabilize much faster with an early
release.

If someone wants an experimental unstable, he already may use daily
snapshots or cvs. I would like to have 2.5.4 to be a hihger quolity than
daily snapshots. Another reason is that I want to base an experimental
fvwm-themes-0.7.0 on fvwm-2.5.4 later.

If there will be no potentially problematic changes in a day or two,
2.5.4 will be released on the weekend.

Mikhael.

I was imagining linking the thumbnail inline as for the other thumbs
(except pull it direct from my site) and just a line in the description
saying something like "zen style by cameron simpson, details here"
with a link to the main page. That would be fine with me.

(And of course, FVWM under Cygwin).
And guess what! Now they have made Winmodems working under

Do a search on Google and you will find it, I chose the RPM.

Yes, I know this Part, but it doesn't help.
I have a new Config build, with the same problem.

Now i think it is not a configuration Problem.
It is my System, I search all Binaries, Configfiles and kill them.
Than I installed fvwm new. 

My System ist 2 years old, with many installed and deinstalled
Programs. I have 3 or 4 Version from fvwm2 installed.

I am looking.

Thanks Volker

Then you should describe your troubles a bit more clearly. What's in 
your rc file? What do you want to happen?

It looks like what is set in decors is entirely discrete from what can be
set using style.  Have I missed anything?

You probably did not miss anything. Decors are not very much compatible
with Style if this is what you asked. This is why they will be replaced.

Please be more verbose. Provide configuration parts or command names
that puzzle you and tell us your ultimate goal.

It's not the details that are confusing, it's the bigger picture.  Something
along the lines of "most people fiddle with the default decor, then use that
decor in their styles" kind of thing.

The newer man page is much better than it was, but still difficult to follow
when looking to set up fvwm in a specific way.  I dug into it more completely
yesterday and am starting to have a better feel for things.  I just wanted to
make sure I was getting it right.

You are correct in that I found Decors to be odd.  It would have made more
sense (to me) if all the window decoration commands were under Decor and all
the window behavior commands somewhere else.

As it is, Style has both window decoration and window behavior commands.
Decor has umm the rest of the window decoration commands.

On the other hand, I love what fvwm can do (and in a package that still works
well on my 233Mhz machine too).  And now I think I've figured out how to tell
fvwm what I want.

Hello fvwm Friends,


I have, lost my problem.

I killed some binaries and so on, but it help nothing.

The FvwmPager dokument/help has a Problem:
the Part is wrong:

...
 *FvwmPager: SmallFont font-name
              Specified  a  font to use to label the window names
              in the pager. If not specified, the  window  labels
              will  be  omitted.  Window labels seem to be fairly
              useless for desktop scales of 32  or  greater.   If
              font_name  is  "none"  then no window names will be
              displayed.
...

The "SmallFont", better is "Font"; "FvwmPager: Font font-name".
and the "Label 0" must set. Than it is no Label.


Solve is:

*FvwmPager: Label 0
*FvwmPager: Font  none 




Thanks volker

Hi all.

I have a question about WindowList; it's bound to mouse button 3 and
Alt+F4 key. Both actions shows me WindowList, but when I use Alt+F4 the
window doesn't allows me to choose a window using up/down arrow keys,
I can only choose them with mouse pointer, and if i release the Alt
key, the WindowList disappear. How can I configure the key binding so
that WindowList stay on top until i choose a window with up/down arrows?

thanks and sorry for my english (i'm using FVWM version 2.4.6 ).

Can I retrieve the value of a desktop label in the pager?

Right now I'm setting the values from a form, and saving them 
additionally in an environment variable:

*NameDesk: Text "Name this desktop:"
*NameDesk: Line expand
*NameDesk: Input deskname 20 ""
*NameDesk: Button quit "OK" ^M
*NameDesk: Command SetEnv label_$d '$(deskname)'
*NameDesk: Command PipeRead `echo "*FvwmPager: Label $d '$(deskname)'"`

so that I can write them out:

AddToFunc ExitFunction
+ I Exec for i in `awk -v n=$[FVWM_N_DESKS] \
              'BEGIN { for (i=0; i<=n; i++) { print i } }' ` ; \
     do eval echo "*FvwmPager: Label $$i \\\"\$label_$$i\\\"" ; \
        eval echo "SetEnv label_$$i \\\"\$label_$$i\\\"" ; \
     done > $[HOME]/.fvwm/labels

(wanna guess how long it took me to find the right combination of 
eval,$$,\\\ &c?)

but obviously I don't like double bookkeeping. I would like that 
first eval line above to write out the pager label, as opposed to an 
environment variable that I hope has the right value.

Perhaps Mikhael  would  be interested in  adding  the equivalent of an
M_CONFIG_INFO to FvwmPerl.

Why don't you just have FvwmForm update the .fvwm/labels file?

I guess that would be possible. Then the file would keep growing with 
everytime I name a desktop, but I guess I can find an opportunity to 
curtail it.

Use sed/awk/perl to replace the label, don't add to the end.

Hi all.

I'm having problems with fvwm. After a period of inactivity, ths system
logs out me (i'm using xdm). First I think should be a system problem,
but if I set up blackbox as wm, it don't happen, even using the same
applications (gaim, xterm and netscape), the only difference is that
with blackbox, xconsole does not run. What could be the problem? Is
there anything in fvwm configuration to control idle times or
inactivity?

thanks in advance

-ejg

I am not sure. I think reading configuration of others is like reading
passwords of others. :) I only planned to add support for its own module
configuration. Let's be confidential and solve it the right way.

> Why don't you just have FvwmForm update the .fvwm/labels file?

There is much easier solution in 2.5.x and I posted it several times.

Just don't use "*FvwmPager: Label" starting from 2.5.x, use a new
DesktopName command. It was invented exactly for the purpose of switching
from the FvwmPager's private data to a globally accessible data, desk
names is something that many modules and WindowList may be interested in.
Then you may read $[desk.name<n>] anywhere. Thanks to Olivier.

  DesktopName 2 MyDeskNumber2
  ...
  Exec exec xmessage "name of the desk number 2 is $[desk.name2]"

Just try currently not to use spaces in the name, because I want
to require quotes if there are spaces, currently quotes are ignored here.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I tried to be as detailed as possible so bare with me...

This is what happens:
	I'm using X for a while, but then I need to get up and walk away
from the machine for whatever reason.  So I call xlock (or maybe it's
xlockmore...) to lock my screen, then I get up and walk away.  If I'm away
for more than say 15 minutes, the machine goes into power save.  When I
return, I move the mouse, the system comes back up (when I say power save,
I just mean the monitors go blank [instead of displaying the xmatrix
screensaver from xlock]) and I need to enter my password to use the
machine.  I type in my password, the screen saver goes away, and I can
continue working.  There is one problem however, I can't move any of the
windows via clicking the titlebar and dragging, via a mouse binding I
added for holding alt and clicking anywhere on the window, or by using the
Fvwm Window-Ops menu that was a part of a .fvwm2rc that I copied into
mine.  When I move the mouse to the edge of the window, I cannot resize
the window either.
It seems as though the only way that I can resize or move the windows is
by clicking in the icon in the upper left corner of the titlebar (i forget
which one or number corresponds to the position) that calls a function
nearly identical to Window-Ops called Window-Ops2 (the only difference
being no Title section in the Window-Ops2) and using the "Move" selection
from it.

Interestingly enough, another solution is by running timetool, selecting a
day at least one day past the current and applying the change so that the
display resets(ie both monitors blink off momentarily and then come back
on).  Sometimes changing the hour is enough, but it has to be a future
time.  Changing it to a time in the past will not let me move windows
regardless as to whether or not the change caused the displays to reset.
Also if I have to do this several times in a day, I have to move it at
least one day past the currently displayed day as opposed to the real day.

The details:
RedHat 7.3
Fvwm2 v 2.4.6 on an i386ish machine
Dual Monitor display, (2 old and crappy diamond something cards)
Running XFree86 (v. whatever came with redhat 7.3)
Starting x with the command: startx --+xinerama

Key bindings from .fvwm2rc:
Mouse 1 TS N Move-or-Resize
Mouse 1 FSTW A Move-or-Resize

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise "I" Raise
+ "M" Move
+ "D" Lower

AddToMenu Window-Ops2 "Move" Move
+ "Resize" Resize
.
.
.

Oh, and no, the num-lock, caps-lock, etc keys are not pressed.

I forget the name of the utility I ran to see if any of the modifier keys
were being pressed, but there were none 'stuck'


ANY help would be appreciated, my apologies if there are inconsistencies
in the details provided, it would be impossible to take the machine with
the problems online or transfer any software from it to a computer that
does have an internet connection (ie I can't post the .fvwm2rc file or
give detailed output for commands run.)

It's not someone else's configuration.
Modules might sometimes need to read other modules configurations.

DeskTopName works better, but the issue is saving the name for
the next session.  Is it saved by the session manager feature?
The man page doesn't say.

I didn't cover the session issue, just answered the original question
"Can I retrieve the value of a desktop label in the pager?"

If the labels should be restored on the next session, then yes, they
should be stored in ~/.fvwm/desktop-names or similar.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I'm using fvwm 2.5.3.  When I select a window using the WindowList

upper left corner of said window.  How do I turn this off?  I've tried
a number of things without success.  Here are some .fvwm2rc parts I
consider relevant:

The function that warps the pointer is WindowListFunc. By default it is:

  AddToFunc WindowListFunc
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p

You may redefine this function and it will be used with all WindowList
invocations or you may even specify a separate functions for them, like:

  Key Tab A 4 WindowList (CurrentDesk, !Sticky) CurrentAtEnd, \
    SelectOnRelease Super_L, IconifiedAtEnd, Geometry, Function WindowListFunc2

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc2
  AddToFunc   WindowListFunc2
  + I WindowId $0 WindowShade off
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus NoWarp
  + I WindowId $0 ThisWindow (!CurrentPage) Raise

Mikhael.

When a window is selected from the WindowList, the function
WindowListFunc is called.  By default it looks like this:

  AddToFunc WindowListFunc
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p

You can write your own function in the .fvwm2rc file, e.g.

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc WindowListFunc
  + I WindowId $0 Iconify off
  + I WindowId $0 FlipFocus
  + I WindowId $0 Raise

Bye

No, it isn't fvwm that does it.  There must be another tool that
logs you out.  Maybe a screen saver.

That's the screen saver built in into X.  It might interfere with
xlock too.  Disable it with

  xset s off

in your ~/.xinitrc.

The X screen saver does not handle passwords, so I assume you
typed it into xlock.

Interesting.  Fvwm relies heavily on a consistent X server time.
Events that are older than 30 seconds (I think) may be ignored.
My guess is that some application that is somehow related with
screen saving screws the system clock or the X server clock.

Try killing all these funny applications that might grab the
pointer.  If

  Mouse 1 FSTW A Move-or-Resize" 
              ^^^

does not work, fvwm does not get any input from the mouse at all.

This binding is completely overridden by the next one.

Where in the documentation should I look for information on how
to tell FVWM to ignore requests from splash screen windows to
suppress normal window-manager decoration?



Thanks,

Ah!  Thanks to all who replied.  I don't know how I missed the
description of the default function in the man page.  Well, I did
actually see it but it just didn't register on the mental radar.

Hi again.

Has anyone here tried using JBuilder 7 (Personal)?  Have you had
and major window problems?

(Dialog boxes (such as a file chooser that should be relatively
small) expand to fill the whole screen, and when I try to re-size
them they jump back to full size.

The main window came up tiny (maybe 100 pixels wide and 300 tall).)



Thanks,
Daniel

This depends on how such splash screen is implemented.
If it just sets window manager hints, it is possible to ignore them
(different hints require different Style options).
If it is an Override Redirect window, you probably can't do very much.
The output of 'xwininfo -all' usually tells something useful about
such splash window.

Mikhael.

What 'xwininfo -size' says about problematic windows?

I dont know what's customary for splash screens - i.e. are
they always transient, etc. But I will try some suggestions,
which you may already know :)... maybe in the very least
they'll point something out that you can go back and chekc
upon, or extend, or something.

Can you 'identify' the window as it starts? if you can, then
use the information to do what you want in the Style "foo".
(I think quotes may not be necessary). The foo is one of 
from the man page:

         stylename	 can  be a window's name, class, or
         resource string.  It may contain the wildcards '*'
         and '?', which are matched in the usual Unix
         filename manner.  They are searched in the reverse
         order stated.   When	 two  conflicting styles apply
         to the same window, the style that was changed last
         wins.

         Note:  windows  that  have  no  name  (WM_NAME) are
         given a name of "Untitled", and windows that don't
         have a class (WM_CLASS, res_class) are given class
         "NoClass" and those that don't have a resource
         (WM_CLASS, res_name) are given resource
         "NoResource".

Perhaps, if the splash screens have all the same information
as the regular windows, and if you can compile applications
yourself, you could change the window titles and use that
info in the Style

If Splash screens are transient, then there is a number of
transient commands that control their look and feel. I'd be
a bad person to tell you _exactly_ what to do, but man pages
have plenty of info if you grep for "transient". For
example, I have a feeling that gimp's splash is transient,
as it shows up on my fvwm decorated as a transient window
woulld be, while gnome has full decorations on it.

hope any of that helped.
good luck,

denis

Run "strings" on the binary, look for things like "nologo",
"splash", "banner", etc.  Perhaps theres an option to suppress it.

Other than that, splash screens are often associated with commercial
products.  Ironically, you pay for the product, and they decide
that you are a target for their advertising.

Complain to the vendor.

Hi,

Is there any way to arrange the order of windows in
FvwmWinList, either in a graphic way or by editing a
text file?

Thanks.

Ben

Hi,

I'm already using the fvwm2 but the fvwmpager doesn't work.
I thought that the pager were included in the fvwm2 but I
was checking the ./configure and I didn't find any option
to compile the fvwm2 with pager.

Where can I get the fvwmpager ?

Thanks in advance.

After reading the FvwmWinList man page it does not seem there is any
way to tweak the window order other than maybe optionally specifying
FollowWindowList (sorting by last focus).

There is no way to change the order dynamically once a module started.
FvwmIconMan has more sorting options, also currently statical.

Mikhael.

FvwmPager is always compiled along with the rest of Fvwm.
What release are you using?
What did you do to start the pager?

is it possible you're looking for an executable "fvwmpager"? there
isn't one, only FvwmPager, which is a module. You need to talk to Fvwm
to run it.

Hi all.

I have a problem with fvwm menus. Im running debian/woody, and if I
add/remove packages from my system the fvwm menus are not updated. The
package menu is installed and is working for other wm, but not for fvwm.
Which could be the problem? How can I fix this?

thanks in advance

Hi :

Does anybody know where I can get a windows package to create a new CDE startup
logo from a JPEG/GIF ? I believe that it has to
be in Pixel Pixmap format.

regards

Phil

Some more details will may be needed... like an excerpt from your
.fvwm2rc that creates/binds the menu.

Make sure that the files that define menus
(/etc/X11/fvwm/menudefs.hook on my system) are there, and that you're
sourcing them (via a Read command) in your .fvwm2rc.

but in the meantime... what happens when you run update-menus?

Ummm, you never unsubscribed from the fvwm-announce list and you never
sent any messages to the list owner requesting removal.  How on earth
do you expect to have been removed?  Are we supposed to be psychic?

I would remove you now, except that there is no address

OK.  I removed my $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc,
replaced it with one containing just this:

Style "Fvwm Pager"  StaysOnTop
*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmPagerHilight #cab3ca
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1-1
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Misc
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Maker
*FvwmPagerLabel 2 Mail
*FvwmPagerLabel 3 Matlab
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
AddToFunc InitFunction I Module FvwmPager 0 1

quit, and restarted fvwm and the pager came up fine.

You must be having some other problem.
Since you are running 2.4.6, you should not have any ModulePath
statement in your .fvwm2rc.

Also look for error messages coming out of fvwm.
Look at question 5.8 in the FAQ to find out where your
error messages may be.

I planned to add such module as either many-in-one FvwmGtkPerl or as
a separate module. It is easy to code it using Gtk-Perl to look like a
table or somithing similar to KDE or an other OS (when Alt-Tab pressed).
I just don't know how is it with images, did not have experience yet.

In your case I would wait a bit more, then with new tracker additions
your module will not have to deal with any fvwm events, it will just
request an automagically up-to-date list of window info structures.

No, I finally decided not to go with this design, it will be removed.
Instead, a statical (or dynamical, by user's request) ConfigInfo will be
just one of the many supported trackers.

Mikhael.

The above ModulePath doesn't look right.
If you are setting the ModulePath in your .fvwm2rc, remove the line
that sets the path and then restart Fvwm.

You should be able to find FvwmPager by typing the command

locate FvwmPager

but its not necessary to find it, Fvwm should know where it is
automatically.

Should be fixed in CVS now (and in 2.4.13/2.5.5 when they are
released).

Hello,

When placing windows using ManualPlacement, I am able to
move the outlines around with my vi-like hjkl keys. I can
also scroll menues this way.  I really like this.

However, I'd like to change increments in which windows are
moved when I press the keys. I did not see them as part of
built-in keys in the man page, and dont seem to have them
defined anywhere in my .fvwm2rc. 

Is the fact that this works undocumented? Or am I missing
something? And in particular, could someone please tell me
if its possible to change the increments in which the window
is moved?
(I know  how to move a window, say, 10% to the right and
whatnot, but I need to know the context for this. Unless I
missed it, I did not see in the manual page that one can
specify some sort of "outline" context, or somethin)


(My only key bindings are included below)

   Key Tab   A    M    WindowList (CurrentPage) Root c c NoGeometry, \
                           CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd
   Key Left  A    M    Scroll -100 +0
   Key Up    A    M    Scroll +0 -100
   Key Right A    M    Scroll +100 +0
   Key Down  A    M    Scroll +0 +100
   Key F1    A    M    Popup Window-Ops
   Key F2    A    M    Popup MAIN
   Key F3    A    M    Lower
   Key F5    A    M    Prev
   Key F6    A    M    Next

Hello,

has anyone noticed that "Preferences" window of mozilla can
get lowered to the point where it is obscured by the parent
if you were to switch focus to the parent mozilla window?
Same goes for phoenix...

The rest of my transient windows (including 'find', etc in
mozilla) behave how I would expect them to: lose focus but
stay on top when I focus on the parent window.

Same seems to happen to "profile"  windows of mozilla. 
RaiseTransient, LowerTransient also dont seem to affect the
said windows (i.e. if I obstruct parts of mozilla, 'find',
and "preferences" with an xterm and xterm is in the front,
and then focus mozilla, both mozilla and 'find' will come 
to the front, but not the 'preferences')

Both identd and 'xwininfo -all' produce output for 'find'
and 'preferences' transients, which differs only in
size/position. Both window types are said to be transient by
identd.

It is possible that I am making a mistake somewhere, but the
fact that the rest of transient windows works as I would
expect them to throws me off.

Here are my transient settings:

   Style "*" RaiseTransient, LowerTransient, DecorateTransient,
   Style "*" StackTransientParent

In case it matters, I am using 

   fvwm 2.5.4 (from cvs) compiled on Oct 20 2002 at 00:42:44
   with support for: ReadLine, XPM, PNG, GNOME WM hints, EWMH
   hints, Shape, SM, Xinerama, XFT

Please let me know if you dont see the problem, so that I
can go back and take a second look at my settings...

denis

ps.  I am still shaky with "proper" use of fvwm terminology,
so please excuse any errors. I hope I was clear though.

The vi keys in menus are used to warp the pointer around the menu.

They are currently hard coded:

  no modifiers:   5 pixel
  with control:   1 pixel
  with control: 100 pixels

You can only change the values by editing libs/defaults.h:

  #define DEFAULT_KDB_SHORTCUT_MOVE_DISTANCE 5 /* pixels */
  #define KDB_SHORTCUT_MOVE_DISTANCE_SMALL   1 /* pixels */
  #define KDB_SHORTCUT_MOVE_DISTANCE_BIG   100 /* pixels */
                                          ^^^^^

It is described in the the "KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS" section in the man
page, although slightly incorrectly.

You already asked this above.

That is because the preferences window is a transient of the root
window, not of the browser window.  So fvwm can not know which
window spawned it.  I assume that was an intentinal decision by
the mozilla crew.

There is nothing wrong with your settings.  The change has to be
made in the application.  All you can do is to ask the application
developers to change that.

I also noted that. In mozilla you're able to use the parent window while the
preferences dialog is active, so this actually makes (some) sense. In netscape
4.x you aren't able to use the parent window, and fvwm keeps the transient
in front of the main window. Netscape tells this to the window manager.

As for 2.4.11 there was a fix included for 'transients of transients' (hi Dominik :-)
which you also can generate with netscape 4.x.

You can see the root window the transient defines with 'xprop', look for
"WM_TRANSIENT_FOR", this reports the window ID for the parent, you can
see the window ID with xwininfo.

Regards,

Josef

Hi :

I have FVWM working :) but am having a problem with SSH integration.  What I
would like to do is when a user logs in via
CDE it launches FVWM and the fires up the ssh-agent dialogue box.  I have tried
adding the code into the .dtprofile but this
launches it before the FVWM shows, then tried adding it into .xsession but this
never seems to get executed. Can I add it
into the FVWM settings anywhere ?

regards

Phil

Yes, put this into your .fvwm2rc file:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Exec exec ssh-agent

Fvwm comes with an extensive man page that describes all of this.

Hi ...

Thanks for the answer.

Sorry about the SIG - the company mail gateway adds it automatically :( Will use
my hotmail account in future.

Hi all,

I use fvwm on a laptop.  When it's docked, it's connected to a monitor
with 1600x1200 resolution; when I undock it, I have a virtual screen
of 1600x12000 and physical screen of 1024x768.

One of the problems that crops up is that an application will pop up
modal dialog boxes (e.g., a browser's "save file" dialog) that are
mapped off the edge of the physical display.  Unless I think to pan to
the right and check for modal dialogs, it looks like my browser has
wedged.

I'd like to make it such that when I'm undocked, no windows are mapped
beyond the edge of the physical screen, so that I can use my laptop as
if it had an effective virtual resolution of 1024x768.  AFAIK, X is
incapable of dynamically changing virtual screen resolutions, so I'm
trying to find a workaround using the window manager.  I need to do
this without restarting my X server or killing running applications.
Restarting the window manager is okay, though I'd prefer a method that
communicates with a running fvwm.

Is this possible?  It seems like what I want is the ability to set the
$[vp.width] and $[vp.height] variables to different values rather than
having them be autodetected by querying the X server.

Thanks,
--Tessa

Sorry about the SIG first off all but I cannot get to my HotMail account.

Question :  I now have a script that runs from within the InitFunction section
that sets a number of variables. How can I make these available
to the desktop and any windows that are spawned ?

regards

Run the script with PipeRead, have the script print SetEnv commands.

Sure.

The shell "MyShell":

echo "SetEnv MYVAR test"

In your .fvwm2rc:

PipeRead "MyShell"
Exec echo "MYVAR has been set to $$MYVAR"

The SetEnv command comes out of piperead to fvwm, where fvwm executes
it as an Fvwm command.  Check the man page for SetEnv.
Then anything Fvwm executes will inherit Fvwm's environment and
see the variable.

In the echo I used above, I used 2 dollar signs so that the shell
would expand MYVAR, otherwise, fvwm expands it.  It would work either
way.

Okay getting there :) The problem is that within my script it throws a dialogue
box to the screen where the user has to enter some data.
This generates the environment variable that I would like the desktop to use
throughout. It seems that when it execs the command it then
carries on through the .fvwm2rc file.  Can I make it pause until the user has
entered the data ?

regards

I must be missing part of the picture.  If you use PipeRead
for an interactive dialog, then Fvwm will stop until the PipeRead
is done.

However, PipeRead is no good for interactive dialogs, 
I don't think you want to try to operate a dialog while Fvwm is frozen.

How about using FvwmCommand?
Start the FvwmCommand server like this:

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmCommandS

After that, you can send commands to Fvwm with the program
"FvwmCommand".  So have your dialog do something like:

system ("FvwmCommand \"SetEnv MYVAR test\"");

Why don't you want the rest of the .fvwm2rc processed?
Is it going to affect sub processes or the .fvwm2rc itself?

Anyway, using FvwmCommand, you can issue an fvwm read command
to read the parts that are affected, if thats the case.

I want to ask everyone not to ask me this question privately. I don't have
a time to repeat the same answer every time. Thank you.

If you can't wait and want to use the configs from cvs, read instructions
at:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0210/msg00194.html

But I really suggest, instead, to wait for fvwm-themes-0.7.0 (unstable
branch) and wm-icons-0.4.0, then you will have it working out of the box.
I will announce them on the fvwm-announce list, probably in November.

The soon to be released fvwm-themes-0.6.2 (stable branch) unlike what the
screenshot itself says will not be enough, since it is designed for the
stable fvwm-2.4.8+.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi folks.

I'm currently using an FVWM2 CVS snapshot from a week or so ago, and I'm 
trying to get my fvwm2 setup looking a little more modern. Actually, I'm 
trying to get my fvwm2 looking like the Metabox theme for Metacity.

I've got a good deal of the stuff looking the same, however I would like 
to have my buttons in the window decorations highlight to a different 
color/gradient. Currently I only see 2 states, Up and Down, for the Active 
and InActive options. Would it be difficult to add a Hilight state? Or 
would it be easy to achieve something similar so that when my mouse is 
over a botton, it highlights to a different background gradient?

Also, while I've got your attention, I've seen a number of windows 
managers allow for Titles, no borders, and a bar across the bottom. For 
example: 

	http://www.hudat.com/~ken/metabox-screenshot.png

I imagine it'd be hard to do something like that, but is it somewhere on 
the radar as far as feature requests go? If not, could we add it :-)

This would break the current symmetry of 2x2x2 states. Making it to be
3x2x2 states. I can't say right now how hard is to detect the enter/leave
button events. Maybe Dominik can.

But "we" do you mean you are willing to try? :)

There were discussions to have top/side/bottom borders separately
disabled/enabled, but not exactly the implementation of this.

Mikhael.

fvwm 2.5.3 on Solaris 5.8
Mozilla 1.1

My Mozilla windows always used to open at 0,0.
Yesterday, some web page opened a window at 0,34.
Now all Mozilla windows open at 0,34.
I tried reverting .mozilla to pre-yesterday.
I moved .netscape
I reinstalled Mozilla.
-geometry+0+0 desnt work for Mozilla.
The NoPPosition stuff doesnt help.
So i patched in a Move 0,0 on window open.
But where does the 34 reside so i can reset it back to 0?

Thanx

Hey, two things. Can Fvwm2 do the windows "alt+tab" cycle through the open 
windows? Have a small pop-up in the centre of the screen that cycles through 
windows that are open. And make it so that not every window gets put onto 
the cycle list, only windows that have the properties "show up on the 
windows list" so that button bars and lists of windows do not show up on the 
"alt+tab" list. I don't want to see my xeyes, or fvwmbuttons, or startmenu 
show up.

Second, I have got a few wm applets running (wmCalClock, and wmWeather), and 
I have no way to tell them where to start (at what geometric position). Is 
there some way of doing this directly from fvwm2, (they do not support the 
-geo argument)or is there some way of controlling them using something else, 
maybe a wm applet daemon?

  Thanks

  -a

Key Tab   A    M    WindowList (CurrentPage) Root c c NoGeometry, \
                  CurrentAtEnd, IconifiedAtEnd

look up in 'man' what they do. 
I *think* this config will work for 2.5.x, but not sure
whether it will work for 2.4.x as is.  I think,
'CurrentAtEnd' and 'IconifiedAtEnd' may be the 2.5.x option

However, I think The CurrentPage option, and 'Root c c'
(position in the center of the root window) position will
work.

In any case, grep man for above, and you shall find lots of
information.

depends on how you want to do it: i think it is easier to
use defaults (i.e. all windows show up) and then add styles
for windows that you dont want to show up. Here is an
example

   Style FvwmPager		WindowListSkip

I am not sure how to specify a style option "show up on the
list", but I am sure someone here does :-) (if it is
possible)

You've got a couple of options... if you're trying to get them to
dock, use FvwmButtons, and have it swallow them. This is what I do,
and I learned everything about it from:
http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/configs/

I would think that there's a way to control where windows pop up, but
I'm not sure what it is. If fvwm can do it (so grep that man page),
then great, otherwise, look into Xdefaults and xrdb.

Of course, if things you don't mind being messy, maybe you can try
opening up different instances of FvwmButtons, and have them each
swallow one wm app.

hope this helps
peter

Once you mark all windows that should not be in the window list as
WindowListSkip, the default Alt-Tab in 2.4.x will work like you want.
You may even have 2 bindings, one for normal and one for WindowListSkip
windows:

  Key Tab A M  WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease Meta_L
  Key Tab A SM WindowList Root c c OnlyListSkip, NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease

If you want to cycle through windows without WindowList, using Next or
Prev with possible options, you should mark the non circulated windows as
CirculationSkip, they are usually the same as the WindowListSkip ones, but
not necessarily. Say, for Ctrl-Alt-Tab:

  Key Tab A CM  Prev YourFocusRaiseWarpFunction
  Key Tab A SCM Next YourFocusRaiseWarpFunction

Hi FVWM Team,

	I would like to tell you folks how much I support your efforts.
FVWM Is an awesome system I have used for years & lets me have nearly identical
desktops between my SUN desktop and my Linux laptop.   Also, I'm often amazed
that some of the newer windowing systems don't easily allow draging a window
from desktop to desktop, which FVWM has had all along!!

	Now for my IDEA:  
	
When I click right mouse button, I get a menu of all active windows.
What I would like to do is allow this menu to be sorted according to
the name of the window in 1 or 2 ways:

1.)   All windows with the same file extension or same name (ie xterm, or 
	.c ) would be color-coded the same color.
	
2.) Even better, the menu would include submenus, ie all windows with file
	extensions ".c", then look under that list, etc.
	
Could these ideas be implemented in future (or present) versions of
FVWM?   Sorry if this email is out of place, please do forward it
to whomever.

Also you folks should have a donations page!  If any FVWM developers/
maintainers are in the Wash DC. area, let me know & I will buy them a
beer.   Thanks so much,
