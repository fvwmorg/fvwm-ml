Thanks,

I opted to take Dan's suggestion - I added another button to the title bar, or,
more specifically, I added the root menu to mouse 1 on button 1, and moved the
Window-Ops2 menu to mouse 3 on button 1.

Actually it's much more convenient than trying to find an open hole to the root
window. <grin>

Peter,

How loyal you remain to FVWM is going to depend a lot on what you need in a
window manager. My wife prefers gnome because it's closer to Windows, meaning
someone else did all the thinking and configuring, so all she needs to do is
click a few buttons to do what she wants to do, which is mostly recreational
stuff.

I wear many hats; I do part time cgi perl scripting, have a server I host
domains on, am the webmaster for several domains, etc.  For me Gnome is a major
headache because it won't allow me to configure it the way I need to.

FVWM takes a lot more work to get set up because I have to do all the thinking,
but it's an absolute dream once it's put together the way I need it.  I have it
configured to fit the way I think and work.  FVWM is the programmer's/hacker's
window manager.  It will be around as long as there are computer geeks who want
to do it their way.

Will FVWM ever compete with KDE or Gnome?  That depends on the folks at FVWM.
Simply stated, Gnome and KDE are for people who aren't computer experts and who
need a window manager that does all the thinking for them, just like the way
Bill Gates designed Windows.  Linux when it first came out was much like FVWM in
that you basically had to do all the thinking.  Linux will do whatever you tell
it to, and much more than anything Windows can do, but you have to know what
you're doing to make it work.  As the Linux environment is maturing those who
are at the front lines are making it more and more Window-like in that it's
becoming more functional for the masses, but they're leaving it programmable so
those like us can still configure it the way we want.  If FVWM wants to compete
with Gnome and KDE they'll eventually need to come up with a system and default
configuration file that has all the features of the front runners and has it
working right out of the box. But they'll need to set it up within .fvwm2rc or
something similar so that it can still be customized as it can now.

Personally I don't feel that FVWM needs to compete with KDE or Gnome to remain
viable.  As long as there are programmers and hackers who like to think for
themselves FVWM will have a place in the Linux world.

When I use Alt-Tab to change windows the mouse pointer tends to move to pos +0+0
on the screen.  I find this extremely annoying, because I'm set for SloppyFocus,
and my windows don't always open to position +0+0, meaning more often than not
the new window looses focus before I can do anything with it.  Is there a way
to keep the mouse pointer in the middle of the screen, or tell it to move to the
middle of the screen with a window focus change?

Thanks,

Glen

Is there a way to position a subpanel that appears from clicking a button on the
main FvwmButtons bar other than stating up, down, left, or right?  I'm having
trouble with buttons on the left side of the screen - when I click it the
appearing panel tends to fall off the left side of the screen leaving half the
left button missing.  It still works, but is hardly aesthetically pleasing.

I read the position section of man FvwmButtons, but without an example line for
me to try out in my .fvwm2rc file I just couldn't figure out what was being
said.

Thanks!

Dear List,

I have a small problem and I was wondering if you
could help me.

Is there a way of being able to arrange the icons
effiently? I have a lot of sticky windows on my
desktop (i am using AnotherLevel - Lestiff style) and
when I iconify a window, the icon will go behind the
sticky window (obviously) how do I get around this.

Thanks in advance,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

Thomas,

I was able to get around this by changing the default IconBox style setting in
the original .fvwm2rc file:

Style "*"           IconBox 1000x100+0+15

This uses a standard geometry setting for X, placing the icon box across the
screen but about 15p below the top of it so that it doesn't interfere with the
FvwmTaskBar.

I rebooted my brain, re-read the man page on "Positon", and came up with the
following:

*FvwmButtons(1x1+2+1, Frame 4, Title "Misc Programs", Icon misc.xpm, \
    Panel(steps 0, Position Button left -200p 0p) MiscP "Module FvwmButtons \
    -transient MiscP")

Works great!

Subject: FVWM: problems with IconBox and IconGrid
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Given this entry in .fvwm2rc

Style "*" IconBox 320x80+1040+176, IconBox 560x160+1040+256, \
	  IconFill top left, IconGrid 80 80

FVWM appears to apply the IconGrid specification only to the second
IconBox -- it tight-packs the icons in the first IconBox instead
of spacing them out.  I have tried putting it all on one (long)
line instead of using an escaped newline, with the same result.

However, using this entry instead

Style "*" IconFill top left, IconGrid 80 80, \
	  IconBox 320x80+1040+176, IconBox 560x160+1040+256

I get no IconBox behavior at all -- each icon appears at the upper
right corner of where its window was.

I want FVWM to fill the 320x80+1040+176 area left to right at a grid
spacing of 80, then fill the 560x160+1040+256 area left to right/top
to bottom at the same grid spacing.  Is this possible?  and if so,
how?

Style * IconBox 320x80+1040+176, IconFill top left, IconGrid 80 80, \
        IconBox 560x160+1040+256, IconFill top left, IconGrid 80 80

IconFill and IconGrid are applied to the box previously defined.

You are probably getting an error message on the IconFill since it
has no box to apply the fill rule to.

Hi,
thanks to all for the suggestions,

now, if IconOverride style was introduces in 2.3.2,
that means 2.3.25 should also support it.

then why i am not able to override it ? using ..
Style Netscape* icon myicon.xpm, IconOverride,
in .fvwm2rc file.

also i checked ./configure file it has './configure
--disable-shape' option in there, does this has
something to do with it ?

regards
Abinash

Re-read Dominik's comment, pay special attention to the phrase "one of
the releases that had the responsible code screwed up".

He's trying to tell you that this code was recently fixed.

Yes, if you disable the shape extension, there is a chance that
the icon will have a solid background.  You would have to reconfigure
2.3.25 and rebuild it.  That may or may not work.  I don't remember
anyone doing this on purpose.

I still think the best solution would be to use a more current
beta.

Hi!

I have found a bug introduced in fvwm-2.3.27 concerning the KDE 1.1.2
File Manager (started with "kfm -w"). If I right-click on a file and
then on "Properties" the Popup-Window will stay lowered behind anything
else.

We are planning to so some enhancements to the placement
algorithm after 2.4 is released.

Yikes!  That's a bug of kwm.  The popup window sets the
transientfor hint to indicate it's transient nature, but the hint
points to itself instead of its 'parent' window.  Thus fvwm
chooses layer 0 to put the window on.  I have coded a workaround
in fvwm.  Could you please report this to the kfm developers?

I just heard a rumor that kde2 supports multihead configurations.  Can
anyone confirm or deny this?  If this is true it makes it even more
desirable that fvwm become kde2 compliant since my understanding is that
gnome still cannot support multihead.  

I also heard that Xfree86V4.? will support multihead.  I use AcceleratedX
now, if this is true I may an interested to see the two will compare.

My boss is running RedHat 7, and he purchased himself the Matrox G450
(dual-head). He got it set up just fine, X shows it as one continuous
screen. Therefore whatever window manager you run doesn't know it's two
physically different screens. He's got gnome setup with some Fvwm2 cvs
snapshot as the window manager. Works quite well. This is with XFree
4.0.something (whatever RedHat 7 ships with).

Interesting.  This sounds more like "xinema"(?) than multihead.  With
multihead the screens are divided meaning youn't share windows or drag them
across monitors but you can drag-n-click between them.  

I have multiple video cards with one monitor per card.  I wonder if this
works with XFree86V4.0.  

What window manager is he using? Is he running KDE?

There's a feature of X11R6 called "xinerama" which supports using multiple 
monitors as one virtual screen. I have not used this yet but I am looking 
forwards to it!

Since this is an X11 feature it should be below the level of the window 
manager and
transparent to it.

We run fvwm on Solaris 2.6 and xinerama is supported with Solaris 2.8 (and 
some versions of 2.7)
For our dual-head systems on 2.6, we use "x-big-x" from x-software in 
germany (www.x-software.com ) This works quite well, windows dragging 
across monitors and all.

Hi,

 My Fvwm task bar keeps staying on the upmost side
of my screen. I want it stay at the bottom.

following is a part of my .fvwm2rc

...

Style "FvwmTaskBar" NoTitle,BorderWidth 4,HandleWidth 
4,Sticky,StaysOnTop,WindowListSkip,CirculateSkip


*FvwmTaskBarGeometry +0+994
*FvwmTaskBarFore Black
*FvwmTaskBarBack #c3c3c3

*FvwmTaskBarTipsBack bisque

How to deal with it?

I  tried to modify *FvwmTaskBarGeometry option, but 
it is useless.


Thanks.

    Sorry, what do you mean -- "FVWM works with Xinerama", or "FVWM supports
Xinerama"?  By the latter I mean -- FVWM knows that it e.g. shouldn't center
popups on the global screen, making them split between physical screens.
We are using 2x2 screens Xinerama setup under XFree 4.0.2, and FVWM's
Xinerama-ignorant behaviour is a bit irritating.

If it's that irritating you could always use ActivePlacement and put the
windows where you want...

I tried your config file and it works fine for me.  As Dan
explained, the box with your pager, xbiff, the clock etc. is the
FvwmButtons module.

> For example, xbiff is installed and is supposed to show up

Normally, before an application is started and swallowed by the
button bar, the place where the app. will show up looks flat.  As
soon as the application is swallowed, the button will be drawn
with a 3d relief. What of these two can you see? Is xbiff started
at all (look at the running processes with ps)?  Does any error
message show up on the console?

Bye

Actually there is more to it than just placing windows. I run dualhead
G400 and 2 monitors running at different resolutions. one is running at
1600x1200, another at 1280x1024. With xinerama, fvwm treats it as a 
2880x1200 screen, not realizing that there is a 1280x176 blacked out space
in lower right corner. as a result it places gnome panel (or any other type
of taskbar) smack into that region (partially). Xinerama provides interface
to retrieve monitor configureation, it would be great if fvwm could read it
and avoid placing windows in "blacked-out" areas. (unfortualtely gnome
panel
isn't smart enough to allow setting geometry),

The problem appears to be in the color depth in my X configuration,
not anything to do with fvwm itself.

The place where the app should be is flat.

Haven't had a chance yet to re-configure the display parameters
in X.  You don't happen to have a good reference on that, perchance?

Thanks much!

I raised this question a year or so ago, and the conclusion we reached
is that doing placement and other things on a non-rectangular display
was going to be *very* difficult.

You could try bottom-aligning your screens, rather than top-aligning
them, I suppose, though you'll still have problems with various
things.

You might try:

 startx -- -bpp 16

(Also try 24, and 32).

If that doesn't help,
since you are running NETBSD using XFree86 3.3.6,
you want to try to pick either 16,24, or 32 bit resolution using
XF86Setup or xf86config.

It might help to go to http://www.xfree86.org and read thru the FAQ.

fvwm2.2.2

The configuration file: (I am assuming here, my .fvwm2rc.  If this
isn't what you wanted, then please specify.)  This is actually a
standard system install version.  I have not made any significant
changes to it.  I'd rather not post this to the entire list, it's 
too large.

I am thinking perhaps this is related to video/monitor definitions
in XF86Config.  Is that possible?

Thanks so much for your help re: this.

yes, xinerama makes both monitors look like one big one. And yes, it's
from XFree 4.

yes... in the message I mention GNOME with Fvwm2 CVS-snapshot.

Dear List,

I have another problem for you to help me with!!! I am
using AnotherLevel (Lestiff WM) supplied from
Linux-Mandrake 7.0 (air). In the file
"/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.defstyles.m4" I have
the following items:

------------SNIP-------------
Style "xmailbox"   StartsOnPage 0 0, MinimalDecoration
Style "gxedit"	   StartsOnPage 1 0, SkipMapping,
NoPPosition
Style "dosemu"	   StartsOnPage 1 1, StartIconic,
CirculateSkip, SkipMapping
Style "xdos"	   StartsOnPage 1 1, StartIconic,
CirculateSkip, SkipMapping
------------End SNIP----------

This works fine, for the current DESK. However, I put
the following entry into the file so that xfm would
start on my other DESK at PAGE 1 0, thus:

Style "xfm"   StartsOnDesk 1 0, CirculateSkip,
SkipMapping, NoPPosition

However, each time I load "xfm", my viewpoint will
switch to that DESK and I do not want it to do this.
Even after adding the commands "SkipMapping" and
"NoPPosition" the viewpoint still switches. Can anyone
help me???

Thanks in Advance,

Thomas Adam

	There are several problems with the command syntax. First, you want to
be using StartsOnPage, not StartsOnDesk. StartsOnDesk only takes one
argument, the desk number; you can't specify a page with it. Second, the
syntax isn't right for StartsOnPage, either, to do what you want.
"StartsOnPage 1 0" would tell FVWM to put the window on page 1,0 of the
current desk. Third, specifying the string "xfm" only catches one of the
xfm windows: the Apps window has a resource name of "xfm", but the file
windows do not. However, they all have a Class name of "Xfm".

	So, what you really want to specify is

Style Xfm* StartsOnPage 1 1 0, SkipMapping, ...

to start it on Page 1,0 of Desk 1 (I assume that's what you mean by your
other desk).


Cheers,
Bob

Maybe I was not well informed, but fvwm.themes.org works...

As any other applications. Here a simple example:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets*
*FvwmButtons-WMakerAppletsColumns 1
*FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets(Frame 1, Size 64 64, \
	Swallow "wmCalClock" 'Exec exec wmCalClock -24')
*FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets(Frame 1, Size 64 64, \
	Swallow "asmon" 'Exec exec asmon')
*FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets(Frame 1, Size 64 64, \
	Swallow "wmapm" 'Exec exec wmapm')


To start it
FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets

Some times you have to use an other name than the exec name
in the Swallow option (use FvwmIdent).

While themes.org is still in the process of upgrading their
hardware and software a temporary site has been placed at 
http://fvwm.themes.org which introduces the fvwm-themes
enhancement package for fvwm.

In the next month or so, fvwm will be incorporated into the
main themes.org software design like all the other window 
managers.

Comments, opinions and suggestions regarding fvwm.themes.org
can be directed to fvwm@themes.org or via Internet Relay Chat
on irc.openprojects.net and #themes.org

Volunteers to assist in the creation and maintenance of the 
new site are welcome to apply.

hi fvwm@fvwm.org

i try to configure fvwm the way i want it.

i want to use SloppyFocus (or focus-follows-mouse) mode, but not 
click-to-focus mode. so, when I focus a window that is parially covered
by another window I usally need to raise it by myself. right now I raise
it
by clicking on the border; but I want to raise it by clicking into the
window. how do I do it? A line like

Mouse 1		W	N	Raise

doesn't really work. The window will be raised if it's below another
window. That's fine. Unfortunately the mouse klick is not given to the
application, either. Each time I click on a window the application's
functionality is not executed, just the Raise-function is exectuted. 

any help is greatly appreciated.

right now i have fvwm 1.x running; if this functionality should be
possible just in fvwm 2.x then I will happily upgrade.

- Stefan

    I had the same problem with x11amp v0.65 some years ago, and solution
was very simple: start not x11amp directly, but via FvwmButtons which
swallows it to a specified geometry.  Configuration looks as follows:

##### A hack to start x11amp with a given geometry
*FvwmX11AmpFont         None
*FvwmX11AmpGeometry     275x116-0+92
*FvwmX11AmpPadding      0 0
*FvwmX11AmpRows         1
*FvwmX11Amp(Swallow X11Amp 'Exec x11amp')
Style "FvwmX11Amp"      Sticky, StaysPut, WinCircSkip, NoDecoration

so simply adding to "SetupFunction" the command

+ "I" Module FvwmButtons FvwmX11Amp

will do the thing.

With 2.2.x, use

  GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises

With 2.3.x the GlobalOpts command has been replaced by individual
window styles:

  Style * MouseFocusClickRaises

Thanks much Dan.  Adding more color depth solved the problem.

Now I'll actually read the documentation ;-)

I sort of thought that applications should be neutral to Window managers.
However, I recently started using a CAD software tool (Cadence/Allegro) to
design a printed circuit board.  I noticed lots of X-window-related crashes
and hangs so I switched to dtwm (under HP-UX).  The crashing stopped, but I
am still not happy.  My CAD support engineer found the following note on the
Cadence web site.  Note that it is not the error I encountered.  I would
appreciate any hints or suggestions anyone might share so that I could use
my favorite Window manager.
-------
*Error_Message:
  X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource
denied)
    Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
 
 *Problem:
 Middle/Right  Mouse Button Function Crashes Over Cell in Library Manager
 
 *Solution:
 This error is generated because of Window Manager being used. If you use 
 a window manager which is not MOTIF compliant then this error appears. this

 has already been reported on following.
 
 fvwm,  fvwm-2, KDE Windows Manager and R4 version of twm window manager.
 
 for fvwm and fvwm2 , following changes in configuration can be tried.
 
 The following two options should be specified in the fvwm configuration
 file to mimic some motif behavior:
 
	"MWMDecorHints"
 
	Causes fvwm to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application windows
	and to parse and attempt to replicate the Motif behavior with regard
	to window decorations.	Note that mwm allows function hints to
affect
	window decorations but these effects are not replicated by this
option.
 
	"MWMFunctionHints"
 
	Causes fvwm to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application windows
	and to parse and attempt to replicate the Motif behavior with regard
	to allowed window functions.  Unlike mwm, which simply removes
	prohibited functions from the window's menus, fvwm simply shades out
	the prohibited functions. Also, because fvwm implements some
functions
	in user defined macros that mwm implements internally, the mapping
of
	prohibited functions is partially based on the menu item label.
 
 for KDE windows manager , following changes in configuration can be tried
 
 Set Button3Grab=off in ~/.kde/share/config/kwmrc 
 
 Note : fvwm/fvwm2/KDE windows manager/twm(version R4) are not supported
Windows
 Manager for cadence applications. It is
 highly recommended to switch to motif or openlook windows manager.

Dear List,

I am sorry if I have sent numerous question, many of
which are probably trivial, it is just that I love
AnotherLevel. I think that it is the best window
manager that I have used in Linux. Much more so than
the abominal KDE or GNOME!!

So, yet again, I have another question for you to try
and solve!!

I use AnotherLevel (Lestiff WM). I have it setup in
the following way. I have one desk which is called
"Desk" (and which contains 4 pages) and another desk
called "Apps" (which also contains 4 pages). And when
AnotherLevel loads, the initial desk which is
displayed is "Desk", and on it is displayed the
following:

FvwmPager
xcpustate
xconsole (started Iconically)

All of the above are sticky windows!! Thus when I
change to different pages within BOTH desks those
windows appear (obviously!!).
My question is.....can I specify certain pages within
a DESK so that when I switch to that desk, the sticky
windows iconify (or are hidden) and make themselves
"non sticky". I know that this may seem like a strange
question, but it is a necessary one!!!

N.B. Does the fact that FvwmPager having no border
(because it is started as "Minimal Decoration") affect
this????

I hope that the question makes sense. Your help is
really appreciated.

Thanks in Anticipation,

Thomas Adam

So then you should realize that the window manager is Fvwm2.  AnotherLevel
is a m4 package which together with FvwmM4 constructs a .fvwm2rc file for
you.  (I still use a modified version of the AnotherLevel package too...)

You should know that the name Desk and Apps are just that "names or
labels" which are set in one of the m4 files; there's nothing special
about them.  What you are describing is two desks with 2x2 pages on each
desk in the language of Fvwm2.

Sticky is not what causes these windows to move from page to page and desk
to desk.  Sticky means that you can not drag the window to a new location.
Something you need to look for is that the AnotheLevel package uses
aliases (in m4) in the file fvwm2rc.decors.m4.  Search for FvwmAlias and
you will find 

# FvwmAlias macro will ease the trouble-- you can use all lower case, 
# all uppercase, or *proper* mixed capitalization
# eg. StickyOnTop, stickyontop, or STICKYONTOP all work
# but StickyonTop will *not* work

define(`FvwmAlias',`
define(`$1',`$2')
define(upcase(`$1'),`$2')
define(downcase(`$1'),`$2')
')

...
fvwm2rc.decors.m4: FvwmAlias(WinCircSkip,`WindowListSkip,CirculateSkip')

I believe if you change the style definitions from WinCircSkip to
WindowListSkip that will cause them "not to follow you around" but still
appear when you press the middle mouse button on the root window, assuming
that you have not changed the behavior of this action.

Damn...  I hate being wrong and moreover spreading lies...  Sorry, I guess
I was just a bit confused.  I started diging through the man pages and    
noticed it and a few quick tests confirms it...  Maybe someone else can   
answer your question here...

If any of these hangs or crashes are in fvwm, a stack trace might help.

Did you try using these options?  Did it help?

If you are using a current beta, it might help if you put this in
your .fvwm2rc:

BugOpts ModalityIsEvil

I'm unable to get inside the Cadence support area.  I guess I'd need
to be a customer.

This product also runs under Windows.  It may be using the Mainsoft
portability libraries.  Search the Fvwm FAQ for "mainsoft".  See if
that advice helps.

Let us know what you find.

Hey, all.  I am running Mandrake 7.1, with Fvwm Version 2.2.4.

I have the following key mappings in .fvwm2rc:

# Alt-Tab simili-Windows behaviour
Key Tab         A       M       Next [CurrentPage !iconic] Focus
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] Focus
Key Tab         A       M3      Next [CurrentPage !iconic] Focus
Key Tab         A       MS3     Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] Focus

Key Tab         A       CM      Next [CurrentPage] Deiconify-and-Focus
Key Tab         A       CMS     Prev [CurrentPage] Deiconify-and-Focus
Key Tab         A       CM3     Next [CurrentPage] Deiconify-and-Focus
Key Tab         A       CMS3    Prev [CurrentPage] Deiconify-and-Focus

and Deiconify-and-Focus is defined as:
AddToFunc Deiconify-and-Focus   "I" Focus
+                               "I" Iconify -1


The alt-tab and ctrl-alt-tab stuff itself (with NumLock off) works fine. 
But if I put the NumLock on (which I always use) it stops working.  Is
there any way to find out what the modifier applied by NumLock is?

I don't know if it matters, but I am using a Micro$oft Natural, but
Mandrake does not seem to map the Window buttons (or do they?).

Thanks.

I see.  Somehow, I missed that my first time through the FAQ.  Thanks.

That does lead to another question, though.

When I used Fvwm2 on Solaris, I was able to use the following Key mapping
to provide a screensaver 'hotbutton':

Key Scroll_Lock A       A       Function Sleep

And Sleep is set to exec xscreensaver-command -lock

I don't remember having to do any modifications to this part of the
keyboard mapping there, how can I do this with Mandrake?

Thanks again

That odd, I have this in my .fvwm2rc:

#F23 is Scroll Lock key on Sun type 4 keyboard
Key F23         A N LockTerm
Key Scroll_Lock A N LockTerm # Linux definition

The Linux this refers to is Mandrake 7.0.

One way to tell what keysym or modifier is on a key is by using
"xev".

If you have a keyboard that JWZ knows about, xkeycaps is easier to
use.

Seems we agree on the correct usage of the "Lock" key.

Hi fvwm@fvwm.org

I have newly changed to fvwm2 on Linux-Pc (RedHat 6.2) and had just
subscribe to this mailing list.

I was used to the Motif type environment before moving to Linux a few
months ago and after checking out other alternatives, fvwm's motif-like
windows is the best for me.

Getting to the point, How do I customise my desktop such:

1. I'd like to move the Pager to the top-left corner of
   the screen, resize it to make it slightly bigger and change 
   it's color

   By the way, what is "Apps" which is next to "Desk". Can I do
   away with it? Can I also remove xload on it's left.

2. How do I change the icons used for xterms, rxvt, netcscape etc
   to smaller icons or to icons I create myself?

3. How do I change the background color of the icon labels? Currently
   when out-of-focus, the icon labels are black on darkish grey
   background and is a bit hard to read.
     Can I also change the fonts.

4. Can I make window titles left-justified.

5. For some reason xbiff appear without any title or borders. What
   can I do to make it appear like other windows?
  

I hope these are all simple questions. Obviously I haven't got a clue
where to start. I've not been able to get very far looking at manpages
or at fvwm.org website.

Thank You for your help
Asri Sulaiman

You may run xmodmap to find this out, it is usually modifier 2, i.e. use:

Key Tab A 2CM ...

Hi everybody,

First of all I would like to say that we have just started to work with
fvwm2 and we are very happy about that. It has a great balance between
performance, flexibility and GUI possibilities. I have been browsing =
the
FAQs, .fvwm2rc sample files, mailing list archives and have some doubts =
that
I have not been able to solve.

We are trying to setup our fvwm2 window manager in the following way: =
we
want that  every new window that is created by default has its =
upper-left
corner at (0,0) position... I would also like to know if we could set =
the
default initial size of each new window created.

The .fvwm2rc file at user's $HOME where I try to set up that default =
style
looks like follows:

# default Styles:
# Added by Miguel Angel Ripalda on December 19th, 2000
Style "*"           BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, notitle, nohandles
Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm, Color lightgrey/dimgrey
Style "*"           MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style "*"           DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"           IconBox 0 -10 -280 -1
Style "*"           FocusFollowsMouse
Style "*"           RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
Style "xdaliclock"  StaysOnTop
Style "sxpm"        StaysOnTop

Thanks in advance and kind regards

You can't specify stickiness per page or per desk, it is a global setting.
Either a window is sticky (visible on all pages) or not (only on one page).

But you may try to change stickiness dynamically if you are not afraid of
writting some functions, which would do what you need. This may be done
using Stick command which triggers stickiness, but I don't suggest this,
you will not like the result. However you may try to iconify on and off
your sticky windows when switching to some desk (or even some page).

Here are some ideas if you really need this "strange" (your word) feature.

  AddToFunc GotoDesk1
  + I Next (FvwmPager CirculateHit) Iconify 1
  + I Next (xcpustate CirculateHit) Iconify 1
  + I Next (xconsole  CirculateHit) Iconify 1
  + I Desk 0 1

  AddToFunc GotoDesk0
  + I Next (FvwmPager CirculateHit) Iconify -1
  + I Next (xcpustate CirculateHit) Iconify -1
  + I Next (xconsole  CirculateHit) Iconify 1  # if you prefer it iconified
  + I Desk 0 0

  Key 1  A  CM  GotoDesk0   # Ctrl-Alt-1 to switch to "Desk"
  Key 2  A  CM  GotoDesk1   # Ctrl-Alt-2 to switch to "Apps"

If you use 2.3.x version the syntax I used should work since it is still
mostly backward compatible, but I would suggest a more "correct" syntax:

  Old (2.2.x)             | New (2.3.x)
--------------------------+----------------------------------
  Desk 0 1                | GotoDesk 0 1
  Iconify 1               | Iconify true
  Iconify -1              | Iconify false
  Next (xxx CirculateHit) | All (xxx)    # if you have more than one xxx

In 2.3.x you may also use: All (Sticky) Iconify toggle.

I am not sure I understand the question, but if you ask whether
decorations have any effect on stickiness, the answer is no.

Mikhael.

hi out there!

recently, i found an image on a nasa site which i really like much [1].
the problem is, that it's ~ 1800x3700 pixels. when i set it as
background (yes, i know, resources ... don't mind, it's still fast
enough ;) ), i can only see a small part of it.

i am using fvwm 2.3.28 with one desktop, with a 4x3 DeskTopSize. is it
possible to split the background image into pieces to kinda scroll
around in the image by switching desktops? =


was this a dumb question?

yours

Hi, 

I might be able to help out a bit...

On Wed, 7 Feb 2001, A.Sulaiman wrote:

First point.  The source files for the AnotherLevel package are at
/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/ and are named "fvwm2rc._____.m4".   To modify them

file of interest to your home directory and prepend a ".", i.e.
".fvwm2rc.___.m4".

The file of interest is fvwm2rc.modules.m4
Look at the top of this this file and you will find that if you look
through the FvwmButtons section that it swallows the FvwmPager.
Furthermore you will find a line like this:

define(`FVWM_BUTTONS_WIDTH',eval(50 + 50 * NUM_DESKTOPS))
*FvwmButtonsGeometry FVWM_BUTTONS_WIDTH`'x50-0-BOTTOM_EDGE

which controls the geometry, i.e. location of the pager.  The BOTTOM_EDGE
is set to different values depending on whethe or not you are running
FvwmTaskBar.  The size is essentially controled by the hard coded number
50 in the above lines.

If you look a little further down (the next section) you will find the
configuration commands for FvwmPager where you will find this:

*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Desk
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Apps

These are simply names; set them how you will.

The file of interest is fvwm2rc.defstyles.m4
If you want to adhere to the m4 philosophy of being able to choose icons
or no icons then you would make the following changes...

ifdef(`NO_ICONS', `', `
Style "*xterm*"		Icon 	xterm.xpm
Style "*shell*"		Icon 	xterm.xpm

# You add more here...

Style "*netscape*"      Icon    myicon.xpm
')


I'm going to defer the solution to the last 3 to someone else out there,
as I'm not sure of the answer and would need to read the man page...

T.

If you want to use FvwmBacker, you'd want to cut the image into pieces
beforehand.  You might be able to crop the image during display but it
would just slow down the process.

You can  get xv to scale down  the image.  As I  remember xv does some
kind of autocrop  on large images,  but its possible to override  that
from the command line.

I don't think so.  Is this a dumb answer?

Pretty neat image.

Its interesting that even at this magnification you can't see any sign
that the planet is inhabited.

jep, i guess fvwmbacker would do the job. but when i open a fvwmconsole
and type in something like this:


*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page 0 0) /usr/X11R6/bin/Esetroot bla.jpg
*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page 1 0) /usr/X11R6/bin/Esetroot bla2.jpg

FvwmBacker


Nothing happens. Shall i not use Esetroot? so what else?

> I don't think so.  Is this a dumb answer?

nope ;) should it?

aaah! this may help. but: in the manpage of FvwmBacker, there is this:

*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page 0 0) xpmroot
/usr/pixmaps/background2.xpm

without exec! hmm?

Its a bug.  If it doesn't start with -solid, it has to
be a valid fvwm command.  I just fixed the man page.

Hi Guys,
sorry to bug on this again, but i am not able to get
through it.

I have compiled new version 2.3.28, with Xpm libraries
included :-))
(it complained at icons.c for color_reduced_pixmap not
found, i don't know and just commented the line */

and put the line (in .fvwm2rc)
Style Netscape* Icon
/tmp/icons/nscape.xpm,IconOverride

here is the error i got in fvwm_log file
[FVWM][GetXPMFile]: <<ERROR>> XpmReadFileToXpmImage
failed, pixmap /tmp/icons/nscape.xpm, rc -1
[FVWM][GetXPMFile]: <<ERROR>> XpmReadFileToXpmImage
failed, pixmap /tmp/icons/nscape.xpm, rc -1

any suggestion ?

thanks.

Yeah.  Turns out it is modifier 2.  I got it all cleaned up by just adding
2 to my modifiers rather than 3.

As for the Scroll_Lock issue, I now have this in my .fvwm2rc:

Key Scroll_Lock A       A       Function Sleep

With Sleep defined as previously described.

In my /etc/X11/Xsession file, I had to add the following near the top:

/usr/X11R6/bin/xscreensaver-command -exit
/usr/X11R6/bin/xscreensaver &
xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

The xmodmap command simply clears the modifier so that the lock is
inactive.  The key still triggers the Sleep function, and it appears to
work. 
Thank you all for your suggestions.

Now I have a console thing going on, but lets start a separate thread.

Lou

I don't think you would be happy with every window at 0,0.

Have you considered using X Resources, for example:

XTerm*vt100*geometry:	80x34+0+0

or from the command line or your .fvwm2rc:

Exec xterm -geometry 80x34+0+0

Hey everyone.  I am having a problem with using various consoles on my
Mandrake 7.1 box.  As anyone who uses Linux may know, you can switch
consoles with ALT-(F1-F7), with console 7 being the Xserver console.

Anyway, I noticed that when I switch the console, then switch back, the
color scheme is gone.  All windows, menus and other backgrounds are black. 
Only some borders and shadings can be seen - none of them are the correct
color.  Can this be fixed with a config?  I seem to have to reset the
Xserver to get it working again.  This does not happen with KDE.  Is there
another way to fix it without logging out?

I usually have to use Ctrl-Alt-F* to get from F7 to another console, then
just Alt-F* to choose another.

Thanks in advance.

Sounds like some kind of colormap issue -- the "Device" section of your
/etc/X11/XF86Config might be relevant.

I do not see that problem on Red Hat 6.2 with "Fvwm Version 2.2.4
compiled on Feb  4 2000 at 03:41:44" and this /etc/X11/XF86Config entry

Hi,
I was thinking of notifying the user, status of
application(watch cursor or some other mean,like pop
up box) when he invokes it, and application takes time
to come up.

as there are many big applications which takes lots of
time to come-up and meantime user just thinks wheather
application is running or its dead.

is it possible with fvwm, how ?

regards
Abinash K.

Colors of icon titles are the same as colors of your window titles (unless
you played with TitleStyle) and have the same background as window borders
(unless you played with BorderStyle or BorderColorset). All of these
colors are defined by commands similar to:

  # unfocused
  Style "*" ForeColor   rgb:00/00/30, BackColor   rgb:80/80/78
  # focused
  Style "*" HilightFore rgb:00/00/30, HilightBack rgb:C0/C0/B4

Actually the last line is for 2.3.x only. In 2.2.x you should use the
following global command instead:

  HilightColor rgb:00/00/30 rgb:C0/C0/B4

Yes, IconFont 7x13.

TitleStyle LeftJustified

A window may use several types of hints to convince FVWM to draw partial
decorations. You may take a look at the man page how to disable some hints
on per window basis.

But I don't think xbiff uses decoration hints. It is more like your
configuration file has something like:

  Style XBiff NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

Remove any such line in your configuration or add this line at the end:

  Style XBiff Title, Handles

Mikhael.

Ctrl-Alt-F1 is processed by X Server (some on this list previously said
this is processed by the kernel without X Server even knowing, but I don't
think so). Anyway this has nothing to do with a window manager.

If you always use Ctrl-Alt-F*, you will be consistent.
Or search this list archives for other solutions on this topic.

Yes, starting from 2.3.10 this is possible, for example:

  BusyCursor Wait True

  AddToFunc StartMyApp
  + I Exec exec $0
  + I Wait *

  StartMyApp "xterm -g 80x40"
  StartMyApp "xcalc"

NOTE: If your app was not started, press Ctrl-Alt-Esc to break out Wait.

But... The watch cursor is only shown on the root window, and not inside
existing windows. This can't be fixed without introducing X problems.

If your app comes slowly, you may use "pop-up" window (may work in 2.2.x):

  DestroyFunc StartMyVerySlowApp
  AddToFunc   StartMyVerySlowApp
  + I Exec exec xmessage -name "NotificationWindow" "Starting $0..."
  + I Wait NotificationWindow
  + I Exec exec $0
  + I Wait *
  + I Next (NotificationWindow) Close

Mikhael.

Ctrl-Alt-Fn has to be handled mostly by the kernel, because it works
on a machine where X is not even installed.  When switching to a
console on which X is running, the kernel has to (somehow) inform
the X server that it's being reactivated, so that the X server can
arrange to get the screen redrawn; and the X server presumably has
to involve the window manager to install the correct colormap.
(It _is_ the window manager that manages colormaps, isn't it?)

Based on the OP's description, I suspect something in that chain
is failing.  Since he said it worked OK with KDE, it seems that
this communication path works:

kernel --reactivate--> X server --restoreColormap--> KDE WM
    --installColormap--> X server --installColormap--> display driver

however it fails when KDE WM is replaced with FVWM.  It may not be
an FVWM bug, but FVWM is somehow a factor.

Sorry, this logic does not seem correct to me. Just because Ctrl-Alt-F1
works without X does not prove that X does not handle it too.

Try Shift-Ctrl-Alt-F* within X and outside X, notice a difference.

I remember reading that Ctrl-Alt-F* may be disabled in XFree86 for
security reasons. Was this a dream? :)

> (It _is_ the window manager that manages colormaps, isn't it?)

I skipped the part about colormaps in my message, because I assumed you
answered this part. I only answered the question whether Alt-F* may be
used instead of Ctrl-Alt-F* (assuming there was such question).

Currently I am clueless about colormaps.

Mikhael.

I believe thats correct, the VT switching stuff is in the kernel.
It works different when X starts on a VT because X changes the display
mode.

Are you saying that repeating the C-A-F* sequence fixes the problem?
Just above you say you have to log out.

This reasoning seems sound.

Since fvwm works on lots of Mandrake 7.1 boxes something else
is involved too.

I believe that the VT switching logic is responsible for restoring the
screen image.  I don't think fvwm is notified.

Not that I have any idea what the problem is.

Maybe the visual fvwm is using?

Can we see the output from xdpyinfo?

Which fvwm release is this?

Dear List,

I have now, thanks to the help of Thomas A Gardiner,
Bob Woodside, et al, been able to customise FVWM2 very
efficiently. Thanks guys!! There is however one final
question that maybe you could help me with.

As you probably know, because I log in via Xdm,
xconsole is displayed. I have set in the file
fvwm.defstyles.m4 a style thus:

Style xconsole   StickyOnTop, StartIconic, WinListSkip

My question is this: While I am using fvwm2 I often
get information appearing in that window. Is it
possible to get fvwm2 to de-iconify that window (thus
restoring it) when information is piped into this
window???

You help is once again much appreciated.
Kind Regards,

Thomas Adam

Hi,

yes, I have tried with the geometry, but the 'plaympeg' app does not =
take
care of it... moreover, each time places the window in a random =
placement...
I need to be positioned at (0,0) because it MUST be there, over another
window (the one for a java app)... thanks in advance

The best you can do with xconsole is start it with "-notify"
on the command line.  The icon name changes with this option.

There is a program called "contool" that does what you want
and a lot more.

If xconsole is started with the "-notify" option, an asterisk is
appended to the icon title whenever new data arrives.  Then you
can set up FvwmEvent to notice this change in the icon title and
deiconify the window via an fvwm function, perhaps something like

  *FvwmEvent icon_name Function DeiconifyXconsole
  *FvwmEventPassID
  AddToFunc DeiconifyXconsole
  + I WindowId $0 (xconsole\*) iconify off

Bye

Hi,

As I am a complete newbie to all of this, could you
provide detailed instructions as to which file I put
the functions that you mentioned. I use the
AnotherLevel m4 preprocessor if that helps!!

Much obliged for your help,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

Mabey you could try this (I've only tested it with cvs version YMMV),

AddToFunc MovitFunc

Well, first you have to make sure that you start FvwmEvent, as the
AnotherLevel package is soo old that it still has configuration stuff for
FvwmAudio...  In fvwm2rc.init.m4 you will find the following function:

# SetupFunction gets run at Init and Restart
AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec xsetroot -solid BG_COLOR
ifdef(`WANT_SOUND_EVENTS',`+ "I" Module FvwmAudio
')dnl
ifdef(`USE_AUTO_RAISE',`+ "I" Module FvwmAuto AUTO_RAISE_SPEED
')dnl
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent

Add the bottom line to it like I've done to start FvwmEvent.

(By the way if you are wondering what SetupFunction does, look in
fvwm2rc.m4 and you will find that it simply added to the InitFunction and
RestartFunction used by Fvwm2.)

To make a long story short, the configuration stuff for modules, those
lines which start with *FvwmEvent go in fvwm2rc.modules.m4 and the
functions go in fvwm2rc.functions.m4 according to the AnotherLevel layout.

In the end, however, it really doesn't matter where you put it...

HTH,

Tom

I agree, it doesn't really matter...  I'll preach the contool religion
one more time.

Unless this is a specialized configuration you are setting up, I think
you are going to find that having your console pop open every time
something gets written to it is extremely annoying.

There  are so  many programs  that feel they   have  to announce every
little thing.

contool will  deiconify, when I  first installed  contool, thats what it
did.  contool lets you enter  patterns that match  the text written to
the console and choose any number of actions based on the match.

You can ignore the message, beep, change the icon, deiconify, make any
sound or  perform any other  action, including  launching programs and
sending mail.

Brethren, end of sermon.  Have a nice day.

:)

Hi,

Ok, here is what I plan to do!!

Having taken the advice of Dominik and Thomas A
Gardiner, et al, I shall first of all try and setup
xconsole. I have also gone and downloaded contool, and
I shall try that one out, and then tomorrow morning, I
shall let the list know which one I prefer :~))

Thanks to everyone who has advised me upon this...

The whole screens colormap goes south.  Kinda looks like the video card had

No, not really.  Typically, using A-Fn will move you to another virtual
console, but from an Xsession, I have to use C-A-Fn.  From a regular
virtual console, A-Fn will change to any other console, including the
Xsession.  But when I get back to the Xsession, the colormap is blown
away.  I have to log out and restart the Xserver from the xdm screen to get
it back together.

> Which fvwm release is this?

$ fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.2.4 compiled on May  2 2000 at 14:38:39

Thank you all for helping with this.

Now, I have to say that I have used several window managers, from KDE, to
Gnome(enlightenment, Sawmill, etc) and the Sun WMs, and FVWM2 is by far my
favorite.  I find it more flexible and versatile than any of the others,
not to mention far easier to configure.  Never mind the absence of gui
config tools.  When those are available, I find them extremely limiting. 
When all the configuration info is handled in one place, it is easier to
configure it with any tool from vi to the fancy GUIs.

Well done.

1) Check to see if there is another .FvwmTaskBarGeometry somewhere else in the
file.

2) If you start X from the console, try

startx 2> zzz

This will place any X messages in a file called "zzz".  You can check it for any
error messages that the FvwmTaskBar module might be kicking out.

3) Make sure you're editing the right .fvwm2rc file (I'm out of ideas <grin>).
I've had it happen more than once where changes I was making weren't doing
anything, only to find out that I was editing the wrong file.  If you've
recently switched to one of the newer beta versions from 2.2.4 ~/.fvwm2rc no
longer works. You need to edit ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.

Dear All,

As soon as I got home from school, I booted into fvwm2
and made the following changes (kindly supplied by
Dominik Vogt), thus:

*FvwmEvent icon_name Function DeiconifyXconsole
*FvwmEventPassID
AddToFunc DeiconifyXconsole
+ "I" WindowId $0 (xconsole\*) iconify off

Then, I put the above into the correct .m4 files (as
suggested by Thomas A Gardiner). I then rebooted
fvwm2, and piped a message to /dev/console. The
asterisk did appear by the icon (and consequently my
piped message), but alas the xconsole window did not
popup so that I could view what was being displayed!!
I then realised that I should of changed icon_name to
the icon name of "xconsole" and I did. However, even
after this reboot...xconsole would not deiconify, so
that I could see what I had piped to it.

So, I then remembered that fvwm2 produces a error file
in my home directory (/root/.FVWM2-errors) I loaded
this and found that the following error had been
logged to it:

FvwmEvent Version 2.2.2 should only be executed by
fvwm!

Does this bear any relation to the problem??

Secondly (and I forgot to mention this yesterday) if I
do get this FvwmEvent working, is there a way of then
telling xconsole to deiconify to a specific area on my
screen??

Your help is again, much appreciated!!
Kind Regards,

Thomas Adam

Yes.  You have to start the FvwmEvent module from your fvwm config
file.  Usually you add this to your InitFunction and
RestartFunction (or the StartFunction with 2.3.x):

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent
  AddToFunc RestartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent

Or if you want to do it manually for the moment, run FvwmConsole
(e.g. from a menu) and type

  Module FvwmEvent

there.

This is a bug in 2.2.x.  When a window starts iconic, it is not
placed by the placement algorithm.  When it is deiconified it is
put whereever the application wanted it, which is usually +0+0.
With the latest beta (2.3.28) fvwm will place the window even when
started iconic, so you can use the normal methods to place it, for
example by putting a geometry resource in you .Xdefaults file:

  xconsole*geometry: +123+456

Hi,

I have added + "I" Module FvwmEvent to the files as
suggested, but still it does not work!!

First  report  what  you have in    your config file,  it should  look

AddToFunc "InitFunction"

Then report any error message you are getting.

Thank You,
I could get busy cursor working :-))

but i don't have xmessage on my machine(Solaris 8.0),
i tried to get xmessage from sun.freeware.com, but
couldn't identify the format to extract binaries,
neither was able to compile source file(usually this
does not happen, when i try compiling other source
code).

will try more later,

thank you.

  not sure if that's what you're talking about but you can use file command
to find out what the file is.

I believe thats Sun's package format.
You have to be root to use it.
I never touch it myself.

I didn't have any problem compiling it from source, but
since I don't install things as root, I had to write a shell to
invoke it and set XAPPLRESDIR for the .ad file.

I assume you're talking about "sunfreeware.com".  They tell you on the
first page in a very ugly color to read the Downloading/Installation
instructions before you download any software.

The instructions tell you to use Sun's pkgadd program, which must be
run as root, and won't tell what it is going to do.  I don't like to
mess with my system without knowing what's going on, so I usually get
the source code and compile it myself.  If it's on sunfreeware, it
must be possible to compile it on solaris after all.

The sample above only works with 2.3.x versions, not with AnotherLevel.

I would try the following for 2.2.x versions, but I didn't test this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent*
*FvwmEvent icon_name Function DeiconifyXconsole

DestroyFunc DeiconifyXconsole
AddToFunc   DeiconifyXconsole
+ I Next (xconsole\*) Iconify -1

For the sake of correctness, ~/.fvwm2rc does work with betas.

But, of course, if you have two .fvwm2rc files, the one in the ~/.fvwm
directory wins.

I have a script written that modifies some configuration settings for fvwm.
After executing the script I'd like to be able to have fvwm automatically
restart.  I've tried the following, but it isn't working (all on one line):

*Xemacs(1x1+0+0 Frame 4 Title "Use Emacs", Action Exec exec xterm -e
"/home/glenlee/.fvwm/emacs.cgi" Restart fvwm2

Any suggestions?

You need a function to set more than one command, but even then you should
remember that Exec is asynchronous and you want some synchronization here.
PipeRead is good to synchronize non-interactive commands. Otherwise - Wait.

> Any suggestions?

  *Xemacs(1x1+0+0 Frame 4 Title "Use Emacs", Action Function EditAndRestart)

  AddToFunc EditAndRestart
  + I Exec xterm -e $FVWM_USERDIR/emacs.cgi; \
    xmessage -g +2000+2000 -name ReadyToRestart dummy
  + I Wait ReadyToRestart
  + I Next (ReadyToRestart) Close
  + I Restart

or:

  AddToFunc EditAndRestart
  + I PipeRead `xterm -e $FVWM_USERDIR/emacs.cgi >/dev/null`
  + I Restart

Please always use Restart without parameters to avoid any potential
problems.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi all.
I run fvwm on debian linux 2.2r2. I have a
question regarding menudefs.hook.

here is a snippet from my menudefs.hook in 
/etc/X11/fvwm/

DestroyMenu "/Debian/Apps/Editors"
AddToMenu "/Debian/Apps/Editors" "Editors" Title
Top
+ "&AbiWord" Exec exec /usr/bin/AbiWord
+ "&Xedit" Exec exec xedit
+ "&jed" Exec exec xterm  -T "jed" -e
/usr/bin/jed
+ "xje&d" Exec exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xjed
+ "&Emacs 20%/usr/share/emacs/20.7/etc/gnu.xpm%"
Exec exec /usr/bin/emacs20

The problem is that _only_ Xedit and Emacs shows
up in the menu.

I am not using any other window manager or
desktop manager.

thanks!

xucaen

That depends on the action that is performed.  If it's the
WindowList command, then the order of creation is not stored. If
one of the modules is brought up, it depends on the module.  If it
is FvwmWinList, this behaviour is controlled by the

  *FvwmWinListFollowWindowList

option.  This has to be removed from the config file.  For further
detail refer to the FvwmWinList man page.  (I did not test any of
this, it comes directly from the man pages).

It have never affected fvwm, only the Allegro application.

I tried these and I experienced a crash, so I went to the next step.

I am on 2.2.4, which was what my System Administrator found prebuilt for
HPUX.  He doesn't really want me running fvwm.  I did try to build it myself
and got quite hung up on compiler errors with HPs compilers.  Does anyone
have a pointer to a site with more recent builds for HPUX?

Yes, it is the case that Allegro uses Mainsoft.  What a shame for an
application originally developed on Unix!  Anyway, the suggestion in the
Fvwm FAQ was helpful.  I spent some time with the Mainsoft pages.  They
don't really want to support Unix it seems, which is rather strange.
Anyway, they suggest with reluctance defining the environment variable:

            setenv MWWM allwm

This I did and have not experienced crashing since.  I still do experience
the placement of the application window with the title bar off screen.  I
did try a variety of style options (DumbPlacement, ActivePlacement,
Random...) to no avail.

Thanks for your help!

  the editors would be in editors menu anyway, so why bother?

  I have found more useful to use the debian menu (see update-menu etc.)
system to change menus instead of using hooks in fvwm config file (not
saying that it's the best solution for you but you might want to look into
it if you haven't already)

  what happens if you run those command lines (the ones that are not
executed) from shell prompt?

Hi,

I am trying to set up different backgrounds using FvwmBacker, so in my
.fvwmrc file:

*FvwmBackerDesk 0 Exec xpmroot bitfile_bkgrnd
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid steelblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid midnightblue

However, I am finding that only desk 0 values are used (other desk entries
completely ignored) and the background specified for desk 0 becomes the
background for ALL desktops.

Any feedback greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Ian

Hi,

I've successfully built fvwm 2.2.2 on AIX 4.3.  It then took some time of 
trawling through various CDE help to find that to get fvwm used after login one 
should add the following line to .Xdefaults

Dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /usr/local/bin/fvwm2

Or where ever fvwm is installed.  Contrast this with Solaris where you simply 
add the following line to .xinitrc

/usr/local/bin/fvwm2

and then use the options on the login screen to use openwin rather than CDE.

Would it be usefull to add these kind of instructions for all the main flavours 
in the release?

One other thing, although I did the above for my AIX system there is this 
strange one minute pause after login during which I can't do anything and I get 
the hourglass mouse pointer.
I suspect it is something CDE still going on.  Does anyone know what this 
actually is and how I can fix it?

TIA for any help

Mike.

The FVWM FAQ calls for adding:

*waitWmTimeout: 1

Check the FAQ and tell us if anything else is missing.

I have a problem that I can't reproduce, but it's driving me crazy,
so I post in hopes that someone can offer a hint.

I use SloppyFocus, and on one computer I occasionally (perhaps once
a day) find that the mouse is in a window, but that window doesn't
have focus.  Sometimes (I think), the focus remains flaky for a few
more window transitions (ie, as I wave the pointer around in
frustration, trying to regain control of focus), and then returns to
normal.  Sometimes the failure happens after mouse movement into the
new window, sometimes after switching pages in the virtual desktop
(via keyboard shortcut) such that the mouse lands in a new window.
The problem happens very infrequently, so my recollections of the
occurances are fuzzy (and above details may be mistaken).  I have
never reproduced the problem intentionally.  Has anyone else seen
it?

This seems only to happen on one computer (I have used the same
setup on two others for years, and I don't recall ever seeing it
there).  I am using roughly, but not exactly, the same software
versions on all three (the problem machine is running Debian
"testing" as of a few weeks ago, the others Debian "stable"; exact
software versions below).  The other difference is that this machine
has small personal hacks to the mouse handling in XFree86 and gpm,
which I highly doubt could cause this, but would like to rule out
(because I intend to submit them to the maintainers).  I will try to
reproduce the problem without my hacks next time I start X.

I am using
- Debian testing
- fvwm 2.2.4, with the following config entry setting my focus model
    Style "*" SloppyFocus,ActivePlacement,DumbPlacement,NoPPosition
- XFree86 3.3.6, framebuffer server
- gpm 1.17.8 repeating an IMPS/2 mouse to X as an IntelliMouse (this
  repeater mode is a Debian patch)
- Linux kernel 2.2.19pre7, x86

Thanks for any clues,
Andrew

It's a well known problem (at least to me), but you can't do much
about it except upgrading to the latest beta version.  The best
way to reproduce - as far as I remember - is to switch pages and
then move the mouse before switching is completed.  The focus
code has been cleaned up in the betas, so this should not happen
anymore.  The frequency at which the problem occurs is mainly
related to the speed of the X server.  The slower the server, the
higher the chance to see this.

Thanks for the confirmation.  Only a second before reading your
email, I had it happen:  I had two Netscape pop-ups one above the
other, with the focus on the top one.  I hit escape to close the top
one, and when it went away, focus was not in the bottom one (even
though the pointer was).  I may have been moving the mouse at the
time.  Moving the pointer into the title bar gave it focus.

I just reproduced it once using the suggestion you gave (moving the
mouse while switching pages with the keyboard), though it's not
consistent.  I also reproduced it on the same machine using an
unmodified X server and gpm.  My technique was to open two xterms,
put the focus in one, and close it with ctrl-d while moving the
pointer into the other.  Sometimes, when I get to the other, it
doesn't have focus.  I'll try reproducing on other machines.

Anyway, I'll write this off as a known problem.  Thanks!

Well, the machine where I see the problem is the fastest of the
bunch, however it is using the unaccelerated framebuffer server,
which obviously makes many drawing operations slower.

hi there!

i am using windowmaker dock apps and other 'transparent' apps in my FvwmButtons. Now unfortunately those apps don't appear to be transparent, instead they're using the background color i defined for FvwmButtons.

how can i define them to be REALLY transparent? is this possible?

also, i would actually like FvwmPager to be transparent instead of grey. With my actual background image, it doesn't change much, but i am using other images with which it's really not very beautiful.

you'll find a screenshot here [1] to see what i mean.

thank you!

yours

andr

(using the current CVS version)

This is an extract from my config:
==
GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart
Style "*"               RandomPlacement, CleverPlacement, SloppyFocus

Style * NoPPosition

Style "UtilStyle"   RandomPlacement,NoTitle,NoHandles,BorderWidth 0,Sticky,\
    StaysOnTop, WindowListSkip, ClickToFocus
Style "xbiff"   UseStyle UtilStyle
==

Normally, xbiff is started automatically, and I don't see anything wrong. It
just happened that I killed xbiff manually, and restarted it by typing 'xbiff'
in an xterm.

The xbiff windows shows up, but it takes the focus away from my xterm. It
doesn't happen when I start another application within the same xterm.

I suppose this behaviour is caused the special Style flags for xbiff. It
doesn't bother me much, but I just though you ought to know.

Regards,

Tung

It seems that the original author of the transparency patch in
FvwmButtons forgot to handle shaped application windows.  I have
just committed a patch to resolve the problem.  Transparency will
work properly with the next beta release (2.3.29) , current CVS
or the next snapshot.

With the current beta version you can give the Pager a transparent
background by using a transparent colour set (look for colorset in
the man pages of fvwm2, FvwmButtons and the FvwmTheme module. This
does not work well, though.  It's probably better to make a
snapshot of the background at the place where you put the pager
and use it as its background image.

That's the normal behaviour of applications that use ClickToFocus.
You can disable this by adding

  Style UtilStyle GrabFocusOff

(see man page for details about the GrabFocus... options).

Hi dominik!

thank you for your quick answer. it's almost working right now.

i say "almost" cos there's still one app not really working. i am using a programm called asmail which is actually a mail notifier. it changes the icon when getting mail.

right now, it works fine with the transparency. when there's mail, the icon changes to an icon which is slightly bigger. when all my mail is read, it changes back to an empty mailbox icon. the problem is, that there's still some kind of shadow of the "newmail"-icon in fvwm-buttons (see screenshot [1]).

i don't know whether this is an fvwm problem or rather an asmail problem. i let you decide.

thank you

andr

ps: it's really not that urgent, but for 3.0 it'd be nice to be fixed ;)

Hm, I thought I had taken care of changing shapes.  I must have
missed something.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

until recently i was running fvwm2 version 2.0.45.  a system upgrade
to redhat 7.0 brought me version 2.2.4, which seems (for my purposes)
to be a transparent upgrade, except for one thing.

i use the Circulate functionality a lot.  i include the following lines
in .fvwm2rc to give myself a ring of windows, accessible with function
keys:

    Key F1		A	N	Next [!iconic CurrentDesk] Focus
    Key F2		A	N	Prev [!iconic CurrentDesk] Focus

this worked fine in the older version, but after the upgrade, i
find that "circulating" to a window gives it focus, but no longer
raises it -- in fact, it will happily grant focus to a window that is
left completely obscured.

reading the man page, it sounds like the "Focus" argument _should_ be
raising the window for me ("Raises the window if needed to make it
visible."), so i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong.  since this all
worked in a previous version, i guess it must be due to some other,
conflicting, behavior that changed and which is also enabled in my
.fvwm2rc file.

any ideas on where or how to look?

The man page in 2.2.4 is not up to date. Focus does not raises.

> any ideas on where or how to look?

I rememeber answering this question a lot of times.
Entering a query "Next;Focus;Raise;Mikhael" in the mail archives gives:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0012/msg00193.html
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0101/msg00242.html

You may improvise on the query to give more results.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Try this:

DestroyFunc	Raise-and-Focus
AddToFunc	Raise-and-Focus \
  "I"		Raise
+ "I"		Focus

Key F1	A	N	Next [!iconic CurrentDesk] Raise-and-Focus

small wonder, if the man page is incorrect.  :-)

perhaps the man page should simply be replaced with a pointer
to the list archives?  ;-)

seriously -- the man page should at _least_ have a) a disclaimer that
it is out of date, and b) a link to any web-based resources for more
information, including the archives.

many thanks to larry for the solution -- works great!

and thanks to everyone for hard work on a great window manager.  my
usage of it only skims the surface of what's available, i know, but 
what i use, i like...

The man page is not out of date.  Some pieces of information are
simply incorrect and nobody noticed yet.

Currently the man page and the FAQ are the only sources of up to
date information.

I'm using Slackware 7.1 on a PS/2 95 box and I'm having the following 
problem.

During the compile for fvwm.c I'm getting the following errors -

fvwm.c: In function 'main':
fvwm.c:264: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
fvwm.c At top level:
fvwm.c:884: conflicting types for 'Restart'
fvwm.h:364: previous declaration of 'Restart'
fvwm.c:1444: conflicting types for 'SigDone'
fvwm.h:363: previous declaration of SigDone'

It's been ages since I've done any c programming, but I did look at the 
source and tried to determine what was going wrong -- no luck. I made 
sure I had valid copies of fvwm.c and fvwm.h and checked for docs on the 
same problem but all in vain. If anyone could help me determine what's 
going wrong I'd sure appreciate it -- I'm sure it's something simple.

Thanks -

You did't specify your FVWM version. I suppose it is 2.2.x.

Yes, it seems like 2.2.x versions have this problem, 2.3.x don't have.

Try to fix the function declarations in fvwm.h:

  extern void SigDone(int);
  extern void Restart(int nonsense);

replace them with:

  extern RETSIGTYPE SigDone(int nonsense);
  extern RETSIGTYPE Restart(int nonsense);

Mikhael.

Hi,

I'm trying to get something to work with ExitFunction, and it's not
happening.  I wonder whether I mightn't be doing something wrong. 
I've looked for example .fvwm2rc files that use this function, and
haven't had any luck.

I have a shell script that a user wants to move her .forward file out
of the way when she logs in, and move it back when she leaves. 
Simple enough; but she always logs in through X, and (of course) I
don't want the script to run every time she closes a shell. 

I figured the answer was ExitFunction, since the man page says 

	Fvwm  also has a special exit function: ExitFunction, exe
       cuted when exiting or restarting before actually  quitting
       or  anything  else.

But when I run the script, it has no effect.  (The script works
otherwise.)  Initially I thought there might be an issue with
ExitFunction passing arguments, but that doesn't seem to be the case,
because there are no errors of any kind generated.  Here's the call:
 
AddToFunc ExitFunction "I" Exec /home/ajs/moveforward mvback-ni

Any suggestions welcome.

A

Is her fvwm2 environment "session managed" (eg, is she running under a
session manager like KDE or GNOME)?  If so, use the name
"SessionExitFunction" instead of "ExitFunction" or even better:

AddToFunc ExitFunction "I" Exec /home/ajs/moveforward mvback-ni
AddToFunc SessionExitFunction "I" ExitFunction

This will ensure that the ExitFunction is called in a regular or
session-managed environment.

Hi,

I'm not really sure of the answer, but think it might have to do with the
process getting killed before it can be completed...

Try adding a PipeRead command before the Exec.  This will cause the
function to wait for the shell script to exit.=20

Hope it works...

Since lots of  things fvwm Execs survive restarts  and  exits, I don't
think thats whats happening, but it can't hurt to try.

If I was doing this, I'd use the .xinitrc and set a "trap" to move
the file back.

http://fvwm.themes.org progress report 25th Feb 2001
Project Leader - Alex Wallis <awol@dove.net.au>


Progress is slow at this stage as VA Linux are still waiting on the
finalisation of their upgrading. Certain key personel are either
unavailable or too busy to speed up the process. However all should be
operational by April.

In the meantime the temporary site will have to do, but can still be
easily modified before then.

The new site will look much the same as the other window managers, but
we all want it to look better than the others don't we?!  ;)
So if anybody wishes to contribute please feel free to email me asap!
Graphics skills especially are in short supply.

At recent themes.org meetings on irc.linux.com #themes.org it has been
suggested to post interviews with the fvwm developers. I would like to
begin with an interview with either Mikhael or Olivier (or both),
explaining the history and philosophy behind fvwm-themes and the
directions they hope it will take. The interview can be by pre-arranged
irc session or via email. (Olivier, I have an ircbot that speaks very
bad francaise ;-P )
Other readers however may be more interested in something or someone
else, so I ask for suggestions and or volunteers. I for one would like
to learn more about Sir Boris II's feline ancestry.
Subject to approval from those concerned, if anyone has a question or
two they would like to ask, please submit them to me so they can be
included. The eventual series of interviews(?) will be posted as
themes.org special feature articles perhaps even before the new site is
operational. Details to come later.

I also would like to include material from other themes projects than
just fvwm-themes alone. I feel this is necessary/advisable because of
the larger numbers of fvwm users than the much smaller number of
fvwm-themes users. However some polls might be required to more
accurately reflect the percentages of either category. Contributions,
comments and/or suggestions on this approach also appreciated.

Other material required for the fvwm.themes.org site are some new themes
and screenshots. Please feel free to mail your favourite new theme or
screenshot to fvwm@themes.org, however all such submissions are subject
to approval of course.

At this point I would like to comment on a previous correspondance.....

IMHO
The whole concept of desktop theming implies the user is willing to
download as many packages as required to achieve the appearance and
versatility that brings the desired result. In comparison to installing
elightenment on a stock standard unix system, fvwm-themes is a breeze
and far less dependent on other packages.
KDE even takes this comparison much further in their suite of apps. I do
not think requiring wm-icons is excessive and may actually help in
developing that project also. Eventually it is conceivable that a great
many individual themes for fvwm will become available, so having to
download "extras" should be seen as no big deal. (Comments anyone?)

Which brings me to my next point....
I applaud Mikhael and Olivier on the sophistication of the theme engine
and the very high standard quality work they do. However all their
efforts and hard work are in vain if people simply choose not to use
fvwm-themes.
Currently, the development of fvwm-themes progresses swiftly, through
the customary tools like cvs, so occasional package releases with latest
bugfixes and new features are mandatory just like they are for fvwm.
Such releases should also be announced on freshmeat as that is what
freshmeat's intended purpose is! If people see an active development
project frequently on the newletter list they can have more confidence
in getting support when using that software. So regular incremental
announcements on freshmeat will only increase and enhance the interest
of users as new features are added and announced.

However, many fvwm users will tell you they use fvwm because it's
simple, yet powerful. It has built-in sensible defaults so that minimal
configuration is required. I would estimate a large percentage of fvwm
users have .fvwm2rc configuration files of less than 100 lines. And it
is the fear of complexity that prevents many from even taking
fvwm-themes for a test drive.

At present fvwm-themes as a package contains only 12 themes with the
flexibility to provide hundreds of possible combinations. But I as
project leader of fvwm.themes.org have to devise a way of not only
publicising fvwm-themes as a viable transportable theme package for
fvwm, but also to stimulate the interest of users who would otherwise
choose to avoid such a lavish extravagance of precious computer
resources.

On the other hand, it is also hoped that eventually a great many new
themes can be added or uninstalled at will, so that users can choose
what they like. But the level of complexity within each theme's
configuration files allow for an enormous amount of variation of
components within the theme design. It can be easily demonstrated a
simple syntax error in just one branch of the package can waste a lot of
valuable time. Just designing or even copying any given theme can be a
daunting task for many users. It therefore is simply not viable for a
very small team of core developers to maintain anything else but a small
group of original designs. New themes must therefore be added by users
themselves, and most likely would only contain the most elementary
components like background or sound effects. This most likely is
detrimental to stimulating fvwm-themes popularity as a viable
alternative configuration tool of choice.

I suggest that fvwm-themes could evolve into something much more than a
simple theme engine. It could become a core project of a great many
complete desktop designs all available by cvs or package release. New
branches to the cvs tree can be added for new themes. Each theme
designer can thus become responsible for his branch of the tree with of
course generous assistance from other mailing list members. Thus more
and more themes can not only be added to the project, but also allowed
to evolve and grow and to take advantage of new features within fvwm
itself as they become implemented.

What is necessary for this to happen? Well first of all a way to
separate the themes from the main engine. As previously stated the core
developer's simply cannot be expected to maintain support for every
theme designed by home users. A possible solution to this is by using 2
cvs sources trees. One for the core developer's themselves currently
housed at sourceforge.net, and another for users to experiment with
their own theme designs. The second tree can contain the core and be
regularly updated, but also extra themes that users themselves create as
separate branches of the themes repository.

VA Linux which hosts both themes.org and sourceforge.net allocates
resources for cvs repositories of certain projects, and I believe that
this idea would be acceptable within the site guidelines. Which brings
me to another suggestion at a staff@themes.org meeting of meta-themes,
which simply put is the co-ordination of all desktop elements like gnome
and gtk themes and xmms skins etc... with the window manager theme
design, as the corresponding resources to integrate all these elements
would be housed in one site with access for theme creators to assistance
from other application designers.

To assist the user in updating their fvwm-themes code as changes and
bugfixes are announced, a simple perl script could be constructed to
access key parameters via input or file. The script could then use those
parameters to update the local cvs source tree from the themes.org
fvwm-themes cvs repository, and recompile and install if necessary,
requiring only a message window to notify the user to restart the window
manager when convenient. This perl script could be highly modifiable and
allow updating of certain theme branches as specified or all. In this
manner much of the fear of working with cutting edge software
technologies can be greatly alleviated. A simple menu click or button
push may be all that is required to run or work with the most current
versions of fvwm and fvwm-themes with the additional benefit of only
installing/upgrading the themes or metathemes that one is interested in.

The widest possible methods of installation are then readily available,
and the whole user end installation is easy to maintain and upgrade.
The difficulties that I see, are mostly in the cvs management but of
course the entire conceptual designs for the project, at this stage, are
merely the above ideas.

I am left wondering how many readers would be willing to participate in
such a project?

I agree that fvwm-themes will only grow to it's full power, only if enough
users will experiment and work on it.

And I'm a bit afraid most fvwm users like it's versatility, speed, low
memory footprint, and not caring about the visual details. I'm might be
wrong, but this is how I use fvwm. I don't own a fast PC, so I prefer to
keep resources free for the applications I really need.

I tried several WM's in the past, including Enlightenment, KDE, Windowmaker,
twm, Afterstep. Each one had something good, but fvwm is just the best for
me. The theme code might be really advanced, but I admit I never looked at
because lack of interest. And the fvwm core is so configurable, I don't
think I even use half of the features.

On of the most important tools to attract more themes and users is a simple
graphical configuration utility. But I don't see how that tool can be simple
*and* as powerfull as the plain config files. Simple vs complete, that's a
big problem IMHO.

The fvwm-themes package has a set of fully functional and powerful
configuration GUI's as well as simple dynamically created menu selection
for all theme options.

Work is still progressing on extending these already comprehensive
abilities.

There have been some recent discussions on the viability of adopting the
debian menu system into the fvwm-themes framework but the difficulties
appear daunting. Perhaps if you felt you have something to contribute
you may wish to join in. We don't have many debian developers or
bugtesters. (If any)

Fully functional sets of GUI's are available within fvwm-themes now. All
theme options can not only be selected by GUI's or menus, but also
session managment support allows reloading of complete previously saved
theme preferences. This enables entire theme switching with all options
pre-selected.

So.... since we already have that, what else is necessary? ;-)

Hi,

I am trying to use FvwmTheme's ColorSet to setup transparent FvwmIconMan,
FvwmPager, and FvwmWinList.

With FvwmPager, I get away with the option *FvwmPagerPixmap. But I cannot get
the other two's color to match up with my background.

Here is what I have:

*FvwmThemeColorset 8 AspectPixmap debian.xpm
*FvwmThemeColorset 8 bg Average (tried with/without this line)
*FvwmPagerColorset * 8 (not working, wrong color)
*FvwmIconMan*Colorset 8 (not working, wrong color)
*FvwmWinListColorset 8 (not working, wrong color)

I am using Fvwm 2.3.28 on FreeBsd 4.2. Thanks for any help in advance.

Regards,

Shao.

Colour sets do not really support transparency.  You can use a
'transparent' colour set, but that does not work well with windows
that change their interiors:

  *FvwmThemeColorset 8 Transparent

However, you don't really need a transparent IconMan because it
can be configured to change its window size dynamically when
windows appear or disappear:

  *FvwmIconMan*managergeometry 1x0

or

  *FvwmIconMan*managergeometry 0x1

> *FvwmWinListColorset 8 (not working, wrong color)

I don't understand what you are trying to do here.

Bye

Hi FVWM people,

There seems to be an issue with using XtSetMappedWhenManaged on a form 
widget in FVWM (not Sawfish, CDE, enlightenment etc.).

If I create an event handler to catch a mapped notify it never occurs.

Could someone give me pointers if I am coding wrong or is there an issue 
with FVWM?

Here is the simple code....thanks in advance, Matt.

I have no idea what your problem is at the moment, but your
program exits in line 149 with an X error message for me:

149  mainWindow = XmCreateForm(myshell, "Myiew", args2, counter2);

-->

hi list

i would like to have my icons lined up in a box right next to my
FvwmButtons-column at the right window border. i opened an xterm,
moved and resized it and used "FvwmIdent" to show its coordinates.
now i put all this in my fvwm2rc, using these coordinates:

Style   *       IconBox 20x71+1007+0, IconFill left top

this works fine for the first window i iconize, but all the following
icons will stack up on the left border of my root window.

i am currently using today's cvs sources.

fvwm2 reacts similar with all the windows. i also don't have another
IconBox defined in my rc.

what am i doing wrong? do i have to use another geom. syntax?

thank you in advance

andr

Dominik,

Thanks for your quick response.

I'm using the latest OpenMotif libraries on RedHat Linux 6.1.  This seems to 
occur with all releases of FVWM from 1.x, 2.2.2 through 2.3.x.

Maybe I should contact a X intrinsics developers or the Motif team, but I'm 
not sure why this occurs mainly on FVWM and not the other WMs.

In summary: the windows WMHints iconic hint is set to Iconised...when the 
windows shell is called by XtPopup and XRaiseWindow, FVWM shows the window 
but iconised.  Under other window managers the window gets mapped and so the 
MapNotify event is generated.

Thanks for any assistance you may have, let me know if I could provide any 
further information.

Thank you, Matt.

Xterm gives you window sizes in terms of character lines and columns.
You've got a 20x71 pixel icon box.
Use xv to get the geometry instead.

Hello Again,

I have tried in vein to fix this, but have had no
luck!! I logout from fvwm2 by using the command 

fvwmrestart logout verify

and a window appears with buttons asking whether I
want to logout, restart fvwm2, or cancel.

Usually, it appears in grey, which is nice. However,
sometimes the whole thing appears in white. The
pattern to this is weird, as I cannot find one. At
best, it seems to be random.

Can you help?
Regards,

Thomas Adam,

Hi,

Recently I started using multiple desktops, before I was using one 
desktop with many virtual screens.

However, I have one little problem when using mozilla with it.
If mozilla starts on desktop 1, it tends to remember the desktop. Now, even if I
move the mozilla window to desktop 2 manually, when there is a popup window from
mozilla, it always goes back to desktop 1. And this is really anonying...

It seems other apps are not affected, so I guess it is a mozilla thing not fvwm.
But is there any work around?

Thanks for any help in advance.

Shao.

Well, of course you don't get a MapNotify if the window starts
iconic as you asked through the WMHints.  If said other window
managers ignore this hint and create the window full sized then
these window managers are broken (consider reporting that bug to
the developers).

However, what you say does not match the code you sent.  I can't
see why myshell should have the IconicState set in the WMHints.
I removed the two forms from the code (XmCreateForm always gives
me that X error message) and now I get the MapNotify as requested
as soon as the code reaches the final line:

  XtAppMainLoop(my_appContext);

I'd take another look at the code if you post the correct code.

Bye

Do you mean only the popup goes to desk 1 or do both windows go
back to desk 1?

It might help to give your mozilla windows the GNOMEIgnoreHints
style.  If that does not help, please give me a step by step
description so that I can see if what exactly the problem is
(including any relevant lines from your config file).

Is it possible that X has run out of colours?

> Can you help?

To help we'd need more information:

 - what fvwm release do you have?
 - what is the definition of the fvwmrestart function

Please send your config file to the list so whe can have a look
what might be going wrong.

Ah, I think I know what you mean.  When a mozilla popup window
like the download dialog is opened, fvwm puts it on the same desk
as the main mozilla window (which is correct) and then switches to
that desk (which you don't like).  This is because the popup
dialog has the window group hint set.  To disable this behaviour
you can use the SkipMapping style:

  Style mozilla* SkipMapping

Hi

I am trying to install xwindows on NetBSD.. So far I download the fvwm
package and installed it... I am trying to configure the XF86Config file..

What are steps I am missing or what is the proper way to configure it.. Also
how do you start the system to use Fvwm instead xdm...

I try startx and it starts xdm...

Thanks
Andrew

Thanks for the help. This helps but it is still a semi working solution for me.
With SkipMapping turned on, it is now better because even if I am in a different
desktop, the new popup window will not cause fvwm to switch to the orginal
desktop. But I really want the new popup window to start on the current
desk/page I am in.

Eg:

    Start Mozilla on Desk 1
    Start another Mozilla window on Desk 1 using Ctrl-N
    Now manually move this second mozilla window to Desk 2
    In Desk 2, on the second mozilla window, press Ctrl-N to start the third mozilla window
    
    The third mozilla window will be placed in Desk 1 but not my current desk 2.

    Thanks for any help in advance.

Shao.

Yes.  Currently fvwm keeps all windows in a window group on the
same desk as the group leader.  Although I consider this a mozilla
bug (it tries to force you to treat all its windows as related),
there may be a new style option to tell fvwm to ignore the window
group hint in the future.  You may be able to move these windows
from FvwmEvent, though.

Thanks for the explanation. I just tried this with Netscape 4.7 and it 
does not have this problem. I will probably just submit a bug report to
mozilla, but I am not sure what keyword I should search for this kind of
problem.

I will also try out the FvwmEvent solution. BTW, is there any way to make the
pager looks like multiple desktops, but just having one desk with many virtual
screens? I like the idea of having seperate desktops for different stuff such as
Mail, Web, Work etc... But due to this mozilla bug, I probably have to go back
to one desk mode soon...

Shao.

You can assign Mozilla and all its windows to, for instance, a specific
desktop.

  Style "Mozilla-bin"             StartsOnDesk 4

You can also specify a specific page, or a specific desktop and page.

As for having the pager "look like multiple desktops", I'm not sure what 
you mean here.  The pager draws little delimiters between desktops, which 
I think you can specify as being solid instead of dashed.  No "page" titles,
of course.  And you can specify different backgrounds for each page these 
days...

hi list!

when i have several icons on my desk, new windows will not cover them
when i am using TileManualPlacement. i'd like to place all my windows
automatically *over* the icons.

at the right side of my screen i have FvwmButtons running. now, when
no icon is around, Maximize grow 100 does a fine job, expanding
exactly to the border of FvwmButtons. But when there are icons around,
Maximize will only maximize to the first icon appearing.

how can i change all the icons to be ignored, that means, not to be
treated as windows? is there a way to do this?

i am currently using 

FVWM version 2.3.29 compiled on Feb 26 2001 at 10:01:28
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, GNOME WM hints, SM

from cvs and it's working fine.

thank you for your help

andr

Thanks heaps for this. Really appreciated your help espeacially that this is not
the fvwm's fault.

I have tried the latest snapshort 20010228. The man pages have the new options
that you mentioned. I tried with this:
Style "Mozilla*" MiniIcon mini-nscape.xpm, ScatterWindowsGroups

But it still behaves the wrong way.

Step1: start mozilla on desk 0
Step2: on desk 0, press Ctrl-N to start another mozilla window
Step3: the seond mozilla window started on desk 0, use mouse to move to desk 1
Step4: on desk 1, press Ctrl-N to start another mozilla window. (It is still
going to be started on desk 0).

Thanks for any help in advance.

Shao.
