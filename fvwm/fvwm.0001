Hey.. what 5%?

I don't thinkl anyone ever doubted fvwm :)

On the other hand an old 386 box running RH4.2 suddenly rebooted around
here :) 

BTW there are problems with the latest makefile from fvwm2.. cvsup-ing the
latest dir and trying to compile it on FreeBSD returns an error from the
makefile. 

If this is something to brag about in this mailing list, please send me a
private message so I can post the exact erro (and prolly a patch, if I
feel confident enough :)

Have a merry new year, and ignore the post if you feel it shouldn't
exist...

Andrey :)

Hi!



I'm working on a gimp script for translating blackbox
themes to fvwm2. The script reads a blackbox setup file
and produces an fvwm2rc file with some images. For a first 
result look at this fvwm2.3.10 screen shot:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/results.jpg

One thing I'd like to improve in this, is the toolbar on 
the bottom of the screen. This is an FvwmButtons panel with
a blackbox-like background pixmap. The problem is, that 
if I swallow FvwmIconMan in the buttons panel (in the center
of the bar), the pixmap gets occluded. So.. what would be 
needed is a *FvwmIconman*1*transparent option. Another thing
is the top and bottom padding of the icon manager. The minimum
padding at the top and bottom is 3 pixels I think, which is 
too large for mimicking some blackbox themes. So, if there 
are any blackbox fans among the FvwmIconMan programmers..


regards and happy new year,

Jos.

Should be possible to code with colour sets.  Actually Tim and
I have already planned to implement this in FvwmTheme somehow,
but we've not yet reached a conclusion how this can be done
best.  At the moment the transparency effect can be achieved
only for HGradient and VGradient backgrounds, e.g.

  *FvwmThemeColorset 6 fg CFORE, bg CBACK, VGradient 100 dtcolour5 CMENU
  *FvwmThemeColorset 2 fg CFORE, bg CFOCUS

  *FvwmButtonsRows     5
  *FvwmButtonsColumns  68
  *FvwmButtonsColorset 6
  *FvwmButtons(14x5, Swallow FvwmIconMan 'Module FvwmIconMan')

  *FvwmIconMan*Colorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*FocusColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan*FocusAndSelectColorset 2
  *FvwmIconMan*PlainColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*SelectColorset 6
  *FvwmIconMan*TitleColorset 6

(The C... and dtcolour... macros are colour names from a
configurable palette I use).

What padding?  FvwmIconMan has no padding I know about.
FvwmButtons does, however.  It can be adapted with the
*FvwmButtonsPadding options:

  *FvwmButtonsPadding  1 1

Or it can be set for individual buttons:

  *FvwmButtons(padding 1 1, Swallow FvwmIconMan ...)

Bye

When I choose a 10 pixels font eg lucidasans-bold-10, the minimum 
height of the icon manager is 16 pixels. Choosing a smaller height eg
12, which should leave 1 pixel as top and bottom margin, has no effect,
the height of the manager remains 16 pixels. (I set the manager to grow
horizontally, by the way.)
 
So I guess there is some kind of minimum top and bottom margin
(this is what I meant by 'padding') built in.

*That* you can control by explicitly setting the *buttongeometry.

Well, it can be set using *buttongeometry, but the setting does not 
take effect when it is smaller dan a certain value. Experiments show
that this value is something like the font size plus 6 pixels. See the 
example in the quote above. For larger values, it does work.

best regs,

There is a bug in the (braindead!) FvwmConfig module. The bug occurs only 
in case of depth modes 16 and more under X. Actually, FvwmConfig appears 
not to have been maintained since a long time, maybe it's the reason. 
In any case, the bug was easy to correct -- find below the corrected 
FvwmConfig.tar.gz file in attachment.

I personally like quite much fvwm2 and have been using it for about 5 years.
The only point which is missing, I believe (and which is a bit discouraging
for beginners), is GUI-configuration on the fly of the main features: namely
menus and buttons (less essential things such as window decorations, styles, 
themes, ... should perhaps also be GUI-configurable). It would be very nice 
to be able to manipulate the tree of popups with the mouse and then have
a routine converting fvwm's actual configuration into a .fvwm2rc file...

(Of course, fvwmconfig from John Lapeyre does this to some extent, but 
the Tcl/Tk interface probably cannot be nicely integrated as a module.
Also, fvwmconfig somehow has "too many" features -- again in view of
use by beginners.)

Why not thinking about an extended FvwmConfig module in this direction?
Implementing "easy" GUI-configuration of menus, buttons and styles is 
maybe not that hard...

I am running X from the CDE (Common Desktop Environment) graphical login.
fvwm is selected as the window manager to use inside the CDE itself by =
using
the "wmStartupCommand" resource in my ~/.Xdefaults file as follows:

   dtsession*wmStartupCommand:  /usr/local/bin/fvwm
   dtsession*waitWmTimeout:  2

Messages output by fvwm using calls to the "fvwm_msg" function go to =
either the
console device or stderr, depending on whether or not NO_CONSOLE is =
defined.
When selecting and running fvwm as indicated above, how can these output =
messages
be viewed or logged to a file?

I am basically new to fvwm.  Thanks in advance.

After glansing at the code again it appears that the height is
controlled bt the larger of height passed into buttongeometry and the
fontheight plus a 4 pixel pad.  This means that as the code stands a
button can be no shorter than the fontheight plus 4 pixels.

The following patch to x.c in modules/FvwmIconMan
converts the logic so that if buttongeometry is of the form ##x0 the 0 will
cause the font calculation to be used, however if you set buttongeometry 
to ##x11 then a height of 11 pixels will be used regardless of the font size.  When the second form is used no guarntee gain be made about the appearance of the font in this missed size buttons.

Just a guess, but couldn't you just do something like this?
   
dtsession*wmStartupCommand:  '/usr/local/bin/fvwm 2> ~/.FVWM2-errors'

I'm not sure if this is the correct syntax or if the ' should be replaced
by " but experimenting should answer the question.

FvwmConfig was removed from fvwm sometime during 2.3.x development.

Work on new configuration tools not requiring Tcl/Tk is underway.

Hi,

In upgrading from 2.3.8 to 2.3.9 and subsequent (up to 2.3.12) releases,
I've run into some unwanted behaviors in both FvwmPager and
FvwmIconMan.  I was wondering if someone could possibly shed some light
on this.

The problems I ran into deal with the displaying of colors.  I did
notice that I had to change a line in my configuration dealing with
highlight colors during the upgrade and I think this may be the culprit
of my problems.  Previously (2.3.8), this section of my config looked
like this:
------------ snip --------------
AddToDecor CurrentDecor
+ ....
+ HilightColor #ffffff #c0c0c0
+ ....

Style "CurrentStyle" UseDecor CurrentDecor
....
Style "*" UseStyle CurrentStyle
------------ snip --------------

I've since changed this to:
------------ snip --------------
AddToDecor CurrentDecor
+ ....
[+ HilightColor #ffffff #c0c0c0] <---- removed this line
+ ....

Style "CurrentStyle" UseDecor CurrentDecor
Style "MyStyle" HilightFore #ffffff HilightBack #c0c0c0
....
Style "*" UseStyle CurrentStyle
------------ snip --------------

Anyway, after making this change to my configuration and upgrading to a
newer release (> 2.3.8), the colors in FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan have
been behaving strangely.  Here are their config's.

#------------------ Pager
*FvwmPagerBack DarkGreen
*FvwmPagerFore Black
*FvwmPagerHilight grey60
*FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
*FvwmPagerBalloons
*FvwmPagerBalloonFore black
*FvwmPagerBalloonBack wheat
*FvwmPagerBalloonFont 5x8

#------------------ IconMan

*FvwmIconMan*resolution                   desk
*FvwmIconMan*format                       %t
*FvwmIconMan*font         -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmIconMan*foreground                   Black
*FvwmIconMan*background                   grey70
*FvwmIconMan*plainbutton                  up
*FvwmIconMan*selectbutton                 down
*FvwmIconMan*focusbutton                  down
*FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton         down
*FvwmIconMan*followfocus                  true
*FvwmIconMan*drawicons                    true

*FvwmIconMan*action Mouse 1 N sendcommand Deiconify-Raise-Focus
*FvwmIconMan*action Mouse 2 N sendcommand Iconify
*FvwmIconMan*action Mouse 3 N sendcommand "Module FvwmIdent FvwmIdent"
*FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry               200x0
*FvwmIconMan*managergeometry              +0+0

FvwmIconMan's colors become messed up totally.  That is, the buttons
come up as different combinations of fg and bg depending on the colormap
in use, and the selected buttons are sometimes drawn with three or four
lines through them.  It just so happens that the color combinations that
often come up make the buttons unreadable.

FvwmPager's colors behave better, but the window that has the focus
shows up as a solid white window (white on white w/white border), as
where previously it was a window with white as the fg color and #c0c0c0
as the bg color with a white border.

I have attached snapshots obtained with xmag of both FvwmIconMan and
FvwmPager with both the 2.3.8 and 2.3.12 fvwm versions.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  If I can offer any
more information, please let me know.

Thanks a million,
Brennan

P.S.  I'm running on Solaris 2.6.  Incidentally, over the Christmas
break, I upgraded my Linux box to 2.3.12, and did not have the problem I
described above.  Strange?  I think so.

  I am not sure if it will work but you might want to try this:

dtsession*wmStartupCommand:  /usr/local/bin/fvwm > fvwm.log 2>&1

  and define NO_CONSOLE (that is probably not neccessary though).

  of course you might want to specify path to fvwm.log too since it might
try to create file in a directory where you do not have right to reate files
(I do not know what is current directory when dtsession starts fvwm).

Hi,

I have a problem with the quit fvwm. I have the following in my .fvwm2rc
file 

AddToMenu Quit-Verify 	"Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
+		      	"Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
+		      	"Restart Fvwm"	    Restart /usr/local/bin/fvwm2
+		      	"Start twm"         Restart twm
+		      	"Start mwm"    	    Restart mwm
+	      	      	"Start olwm"        Restart /usr/openwin/bin/olwm
+		        "Start tvtwm"       Restart vtwm
+		      	"Start dummy"       Restart xterm -sb
+		      	""		    Nop
+		      	"No, Don't Quit"    Nop

When I choose "Yes, really quit" , the fvwm exits partially by removing
the destop buttons , menus etc, but the applications that I have been
running still remain up, and I have to close them myself. even after
that the Xsession does not close, and I have to kill this process from
another machine by rlogging into the original machine. 

I searched the FAQ, manual, and the mailing list archive but did not
find a solution.

Can anyone tell me where I went wrong ?

Also Is there a way to line up the icons automatically to one side of
the visible screen ? SnapAttraction and SnapGrid are for bringing the
icons/windows together when they are close together. and I don't want to
use icon boxes. I mean either ther musst be  an option which tells all
the icons to go to the left side (or whatever ) of teh screen (like in
dtwm for CDE)
OR
something to rearrange the icons on the desktop when they are scattered
all over the desktop.

Please mention the version of fvwm you are using and a little aboout the
OS you are using.

I'm going to assume you are starting fvwm with a ".xinitrc".

At least one command in the ".xinitrc" has to hold the "X session",
that is, it doesn't exit.

Some people use the window manager for that, others use a program
like xlogout, or xconsole.  Any program that doesn't exit until you
tell it to will do.

Take a look at your .xinitrc and notice which programs are backgrounded,
and which programs are run in the foreground.

The "Style * IconBox, IconGrid, IconFill" commands control the placement
of desktop icons.

Currently, there is no way to draw a grid on the screen and move all the
icons into it.

Dan,

I work on Sun Solaris 2.6 machine with CDE sitting on it by default.. I
am using fvwm2.2

I did not know how to start fvwm from .xinitrc , so I read the CDE
documentation and put a line in my /$USER/.dt/sesions/home/dt.resources
file  as follows - 

dtsession*wmStartupCommand:     /usr/local/bin/fvwm2

So whenever I login from CDE login screen fvwm2 is started instead of
dtwm. Can you please tell me what to do so that I can logout using the
Quit in fvwm ?

I've hit a similar problem exitting from 224 or 2311 (solaris2.5 started
from .xinitrc).
Quitting kicks me out of the windowing environment but not back to the
prompt, I noticed while logged in on another machine that there was one
windowing prcoess still running. Killing it didnt help. Killing every
process i own didnt help. I had to reboot.
Perhaps fvwm should kill -9 any windowing process that refuses to die
gracefully.

I ran into this myself. Since CDE launches the window manager, quitting
the Window manager doesnt necessarily quit CDE>

CDE requires a special command to quit.

AddToMenu Quit-Verify   "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title       
+          "Yes, Really Quit(CDE)"  Exec exec /usr/dt/bin/dtaction ExitSession


Try that.

  that's more of a CDE question than fvwm question, so I guess you'd get
better answer from CDE docs/newsgroups etc...

  however, since you're using fvwm, why don't you get rid of CDE and simply
use xdm or startx or whatever other method is provided to start 'plain' X.

  you need .xinitrc for startx, .xsession (or is it .Xsession?) for xdm, for
start, simply put one line there:

# sample trivial .xinitrc or .xsession
/usr/local/bin/fvwm2

  if you will add more commands, each of them should be before fvwm2 and ran
in background:

# sample simple .xinitrc or .xsession
xterm&
xeyes&
someOtherProgram&		# all programs have & (run in background)
/usr/local/bin/fvwm2	# always last, no &

  that way, if you quit fvwm2, the X will exit.

  I think it is fairly good idea to simply symlink the .xinitrc to
.xsession, so that no matter how you start X you always have the same
environment.

  for sample files (and system defaults) look into

/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit
/usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm

  these locations might vary across the systems, also try:

find / -name \*xinitrc\* -print > find.log

  there might not be any xinitrc/xsession examples/defaults on your system,
in that case just use what I suggested above...

  ctrl-alt-backspace should exit X (does not save anything, it is fairly
non-graceful exit)

  it is definitely not up to fvwm to automatically kill any 
other X programs.

  if you want the fvwm to exit the X you have to set up X, or 
write fvwm function (like was suggested in other post).

  fvwm is a window manager, not a session manager. let's not 
have all programs do everything... (but perhaps a session 
manager module for fvwm is not entirely bad idea).

  my point is that simply quitting fvwm should leave the rest 
of X (other programs) untouched - I might want to start 
another window manager, I might be using different session 
manager etc... (and that's what fvwm currently does, I am 
advocating status quo)

Hi!

I'm trying to get an fvwm2 setup to work, in which I can switch
between different themes, without having to quit X and start up 
again. 

Now, I use an FvwmButtons instance in several themes, with a different 
lay out in each theme (different button size). It appears, that the 
FvwmButtons instance doesn't resize automatically on a restart. Only
when 
I kill the module by hand (using KillModule FvwmButtons from the
fvwm console) and then restart, the FvwmButtons module appears
correctly.

So I tried to add a 'KillModule *' to the StartFunction (and the 
RestartFunction,) but then, I don't see any modules at all: they
probably
get killed (why? shouldn't the StartFunction be executed before anything
else?)
Maybe I should also note that I use m4 processing. (which on a restart
does
seem to work, because other m4 dependent features of the theme do appear 
correctly.)

Maybe someone knows something else that I could try. In case you want to
look
at my setup, please go to http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/fvwm.html . I'm
using
fvwm2.3.10 by the way.

regards,

Jos.

  AFAIUI, if 'fvwm2' is the last thing in your .xinitrc, then quitting it
will terminate that script and X will terminate (forcing your app.s to die
as well).

  I have to say, though, that (under Solaris at least) ISTR *sometimes*
getting a situation where for some reason a live child process caused X to
think the script hadn't terminated; it happens so rarely that I've never
bothered to investigate.


  I run 'fvwm2 &' myself, then run a noddy prog. 'X-session' at the end of
my .xinitrc that does nothing but sleep. This allows me to exit fvwm &
restart it or something else without logging out, and I've not had
problems for a couple of years or more with this method. Of course, your
main-menu 'Exit' needs to kill this process (I have a util. to effectively
'kill -9 `ps | grep foo | awk "print $1"`').

  All of which is rather OT ...

Unfortunately it seems to be impossible to do this.
WHen the window is iconified, X doesn't inform the
window manager of icon or window name changes.

Whats a "potential problem"?

If you have a core file:

  If you compiled with gcc, use gdb.

  If you compiled with Sun's compiler, use dbx.

If you suspect memory corruption or leaking, use Purify (if you have it).

If you are getting incorrect behavior, find the area of fvwm you suspect.
See if there is any debugging code you can enable thru recompile.
Consider adding debugging statements or stepping thru execution with dbx
or gdb.

Thank you for this pointer, I use it now and it works fine.

Is there anyway to disable the (CDE) question from being asked, if I
really want to quit? Thanks.

Pradeep.

How can identify display the icon name if it's not set?

I am confused now.  Can you rephrase that?  I don't understand
what youre trying to tell me.  I need some instructions how I
can see this myself.

You shouldn't have to (and you can't do it anyway).  Fvwm
informs the modules of (de)iconification regardless of how
it was triggered.

I would really like to see a new option added to "*FvwmIconMan*sort".
It would be nice to have the icons sorted using the windows' horizontal
and/or vertical distances from the top left corner of the virtual
desktop.
The window centers could be used for the calculation (as is done with
the
builtin Direction command).

I often have about 10 xterms open and I never know which button
corresponds
to which window.   

The sorting should not be affected the state of the window (iconized or
non-iconized).
The icons would have to be redrawn every time a window is moved but I
would hope this wouldn't be too difficult.

Fvwm2 will terminate if I issue the following command several times
from FvwmTalk or FvwmConsole:

	Style ttt UseStyle xterm

The first time the command is run there is no problem.
Sometimes I can enter it a couple of times but usually on the third or
forth attempt fvwm2 just dies.

This is repeatable with both 2.3.11 and 2.3.12 under linux.

In order to rule out something funny with my .fvwm2rc file I replaced it
with a
one line file as follows:
 #########################################
 # .fvwm2rc
 Style xterm             ForeColor black
 #########################################
I launched FvwmConsole from the default mouse menu and issued
the same command (Style ttt UseStyle xterm).
After about 4 tries, fvwm2 hung again.

This may seem like a minor problem but I run into the same issue with
more complex styles and decors.

you could try something like:
rpm -V `rpm -qa | grep c++` (note the backquotes)

mabey it will tell you what is broken?

good luck,
sa

P.S. Check out the fvwm FAQ, IIRC it will tell you how to compile fvwm
without c++. that is, if you can't get it working.

Forgive my if this in an FAQ...

I'm having trouble controlling window placement; I've added:

	Style "*"	SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement

to ~/.fvwm/default-style.hook, and restarted, but when I start a new window, it
still insists on user placement. I can put other controls in this file (e.g.
NoTitle), and they take effect, so I know it's being read. I've also tried
RandomPlacement on its own.

I'm new to FVWM, so I assume I'm missing something obvious?

Any help appreciated.

best regards.
Calum.

Sounds like this is being read before the file that sets ActivePlacement
therefore it takes over.

Yep, that sounds likely; so, any idea where the "correct" place would be to
change this setting in ~/.fvwm? post.hook perhaps? I have a feeling I tried
this, but maybe not.

Is there any way to show the current/active settings?

Thanks,
Calum.

Hi,

This one is from a while back and I can't remember what ever became of it
(though it appears from the fvwm2 web page that a nice set of buttons were
finnished).  I'm not sure how most people come by these hex numbers to
generate the buttons, but I ran across a neat set of defines in a
book by Peter van der Linden which look to be quite usefull.  The book is
"Expert C Programming" and the defines are on pg 203-204.  If they are of
interest and finding a copy of the book to look into seems like too much
trouble, let me know and I'll post them.

More vector buttons for the web page would be nice.

Usually the entire content of a book would be copyrighted.

Those numbers aren't in hex.  The "x" in the middle just separates the
x and y coordinates of the location.

I really should read the man page more...

In this case it was originally posted on a news group.  But in the end I
think it is of little use after seeing what the vector button definitions
really mean...

One quick question which is not mentioned in the man page?  The
coordinates refer to pixel numbers right?  What is the maximum number; or
does this determine the size of the button?

Hi,

I'm getting a segmentation fault from FvwmForm which only occurs when the
number of items grows to become comparable to the MAX_ITEMS definition in
FvwmForm.c.

In fact changing this 

/* tba: use dynamic buffer expanding */
#define MAX_LINES 16
#define MAX_ITEMS 64

to this

/* tba: use dynamic buffer expanding */
#define MAX_LINES 26
#define MAX_ITEMS 84

gets rid of the problem.  So, the problem must be occuring in the dynamic
memory allocation.  (This idea is born out from using gdb.) 
Is anyone familiar enough with this code to be able to
track down this bug without having to learn it in it's entirety (sp?) like
I would?  If not, I will try to take a stab at it.

Tom

Oh yeah...  This occurs with both fvwm2.2.2 and fvwm2.2.4 .

In the 2.3.x series, all of the limits in FvwmForm are removed.

The numbers go from 0 to 100 and can be thought  of as a percentage of
the buttons height.  The vector buttons  resize depending on the title
height.

So then do you, Dan, suggest that I simply use my down and dirty hack for
now and wait for the 2.3.x series since the memory managment issue is
apparently managed in a different way?

Yes.

The changes to FvwmForm are too extensive to put into the 2.2.x series.
Just making the hard coded numbers larger should suffice for the 2.2.x
series.

Right now we don't have a definite plan for 2.2.5 but if you like you can
send me the numbers you needed to increase and if we do create a 2.2.5
I'll try to get them in.

Dan, the numbers in this e-mail above.  The problem occurs when using an
AnotherLevel option to include a form for accessing the possible
screensaver options for which there are some 70 or so...

Hi,

Warning I'm about to plead for some help... I've got a Dell installed
RedHat 6.1 system at work with gcc 2.95 installed (which has had some
problems) and I'm having some trouble building fvwm2.2.4.

The configure tests report 
...
checking for limits.h... no
checking for malloc.h... yes
checking for string.h... yes
checking for memory.h... yes
checking for unistd.h... yes
checking for getopt.h... yes
checking for sys/select.h... yes
checking for sys/systeminfo.h... no
...

among other things.

On executing make all I get 
...

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../libs  -I/usr/X11R6/include    -g -O2
-c windows.c
In file included from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-linux/2.95.2/include/limits.h:117,
                 from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-linux/2.95.2/include/syslimits.h:7,
                 from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-linux/2.95.2/include/limits.h:11,
                 from windows.c:18:
/usr/include/limits.h:117: No include path in which to find limits.h
make[2]: *** [windows.o] Error 1
...

Can someone tell me where configure searches for limits.h?  That is, what
if limits.h is missing, then from where because I can find limits.h on the
system.

Thanks much,

Tom

Ps.   rpm -V `rpm -qa | grep c++`  reports all is a-okay.

  it looks like your gcc is not configured properly. the following program
should compile:

-----------cut here
#include <limits.h>
int main(void) {return 0;}
-----------cut here

using gcc file.c

  if it does not, check the gcc configuration (I am not sure how to
configure it, it usually is properly configured during installation, check
the installation instructions for gcc).

  if it does compile then it's a mystery...

That's bad. What happened to your limits.h? Should live in
/usr/include/limits.h. Somehow the file must have gotten blown away,
since other basic /usr/include stuff seems to be getting properly
found. I'm not sure if you want to get it from, but my RH6.0 box
(vanilla, with security patches) reports the file coming from
glibc-devel.

Subject: FVWM: How to set color for sticky Window
Mime-Version: 1.0

In 1.24 there were the commands StickyForeColor and StickyBackColor		to set 
the color of Inactive Sticky windows.
I found them particularly useful to distinguish sticky windows from others.

They apparently have been removed in version 2.2.4 and
I have found no such equivalent.

I've try to mimic their behavior by defining a decor, but I have not
found a proper way to do it, specially
in the case were the window is sticked from a menu action :
 it seems that I should use a Style command to redefine the inactive color
of a window, but then how to do it from a Function ?
What should I do ?

Second by default, sticky window get horizontal bars in the title
(and the faq says how to put them on every title), but
how to remove them from sticky windows ?

Regards,

Yves.
I

Hi!

Funny title isn't it? The discussion on vector buttons gave me
an idea on how to facilitate designing fvwm vector buttons,
without having to write an entire drawing program.

I just made a perl script, that converts encapsulated postscript
files to fvwm vector button definitions. This way, you can draw
your buttons using xfig, then export them to eps, and run the script, 
which then produces your button definition. The script probably won't work
on very complicated eps files like your girlfriend's picture, it only 
looks for polygons. But I guess this will suffice.

Go see and try:

Have fun,

Thanks Erik and Michael,

Erik your little test below showed exactly the same compile errors as the
fvwm2 build. (i.e. you hit it right on the head.)  At least now my problem
has been narrowed down quite a bit!  What I still do not understand is
that the file /usr/include/limits.h exists and is part of the following
package: glibc-devel-2.1.1-6

Well, thanks a lot for getting me started, I'll head off and dig into the
docs and bug the sysadmin some...

  I think it's worse in my case :-(  The wretched GUI builder we have to
use plots & maps a window the moment we create it - before we can
determine where it's supposed to be, so it actually comes up with a
'default' location/size (1x1+0+0 in this case). *Then* we have to move it
to the right place. <sigh> I wish I had the time & budget to recode it to
use Qt or something.

  Anyway, from what I can tell, the window's *created* 'correctly' at
+0+0, but then gets stuffed when I do the later move/resize. Well, when
the GUI builder does it, but I've fairly certain it issues a straight
Configure request.

  Do other (older?) WMs like ol[v]wm/CDE *always* fiddle with the co-ords
given by the user in order to take into account the decor?


  I guess a PositionIgnoresDecor type option would be kind of nice ... but
then you have to worry about whether you really make it a Configure...
option that includes the actual *size* in the calculation (not something
I've ever seen, to be honest, but I can see, for example, a use when one
wants a full-screen window (say 800x600 on such a sized display), but
*creating* one makes a window /larger/ than the display afte the decor's
added). Hmm.

  Sorry :)  For me, at least, "wibble" = "small jittery wobble". For the

It is a well known bug and is fixed in version 2.4. YEAH! :-)

Hi

In the 'features' list on the web site, multi - screen support is
listed. However, I could find no reference to it in the FAQ or anywhere
else obvious. Can you point me in the right direction?

What I would like to do is be able to push a window from 1 screen onto
another and have it partially displayed on both screens if I choose. Is
this possible?


Thanks
Rob

Hi

In the latest snapshot version 2.3.13, there is a new 'transparent' 
option for FvwmTheme. This would be just what I need to improve my
'Blackbox2fvwm-themes' perl script ;-)

To mimic the Blackbox toolbar, I swallowed the icon manager in an 
fvwmbuttons panel wich has a background pixmap, and I'd like to make 
the pixmap shine through the swallowed iconmanager. Howver, when I 
try someting like: 

*FvwmThemeColorset 4 Transparent
*FvwmIconMan*1*FocusColorset 4

the iconmanager appears in a flat grey color, and occludes the pixmap, 
bummer.. Using a grandient color set does work.

Is there maybe still a bug, or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

regards,

Jos.

If you have multiple screens configured for X, fvwm starts on
all of them automatically.

No.  X doesn't allow windows windows to switch between different
screens.  Even if it did, the application itself had to know
about the screen switch.  Sorry.

Well, that's not strictly true depending on what you mean by "screen".
If you mean multiple physical screens, X _can_ do this, but in order for
it to work you have to be running one X server that treats all the
screens as one large bit of real-estate.  The applications all think
it's a normal screen (just a really wide--or tall--one :) and the X
server determines what pixels get drawn on each screen given the
geometry.  I've seen this done before, where you can move the mouse,
windows, etc. between screens.

At any rate, this obviously isn't within the purview of the window
manager (or any other application).

Right. Macs have always been able to do this, and the Xinerama
extension in XFree86 4.0 (upcoming) is going to do it too. Pretty
neat. Doesn't allow some of the funny stuff the Mac did, like
different visuals on each screen! So weird to move items between an
8-bit dpy and a 1-bit... Freaky. Oh look, we've wandered way off
topic.

Fvwm doesn't do anything with your umask.  Make sure you have
set your umask in some shell that is a parent of the shell
that launches fvwm.

Try the fixes I just committed.  They should take care of the

Sorry to junk if not interested:

                                AnotherLevelUp

a `new' fvwm2 configuration package based heavily on Red Hat's AnotherLevel,
but with much more flexibility in decor and persistence of user settings.

See:    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU

for details and download (GPL, no warranty, beta release, comments welcome and
regular updates promised).

It has many features which may be of interest to this list, including, e.g.:

	Loading/saving named theme/preferences sets
		with Shared themes (~50 ready made)

	FvwmScript for editing XTerm X resources,
        	with FvwmScript Colour browser

	Table driven `toggle functions' -- persistent on/off dynamic user
		settings, e.g. Console window, xbiff, GMC

Thanks, John Latham

Hi,

Sorry for asking what is probably a very simple question...

I want to simplify some junk in the AnotherLevel package and so am trying
to do something like this.

AddToMenu WindowManagers
+  ""	Title
+  "Fvwm2 Win95-decors" \
	Exec exec echo Fvwm95 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE;  \
	Restart HOME/bin/RunWM
+  "Fvwm2 ... other decors

But of course it does not work.  Is there a simple way like this to
execute the two commands for a single menu selection?

If not, is there a way to execute one command dependent on what the user
selects from the menu and then execute a single default command 
(which is independent of the selection) in addition?

Thanks,
Tom

Ps. The file is M4 processed so things like HOME and USER_WM_STYLE get
filled in...

I'm using fvwm2-2.2.2 on RedHat Linux 6.1.  When I just click on the
root window (no mouse motion) the menu stays up.  Is there any way to
set a `timeout' value so eventually the menu will go away if noone
selects a menu entry?  Thanks.

You could try placing the commands inside a fvwm2 function, and call that:

	AddToMenu WindowManagers
	+  "" Title
	+  "Fvwm2 Win95-decors" Function RestartFvwm95
	+  "Fvwm2 ... other decors

	AddToFunc RestartFvwm95
	+ "I" Exec echo Fvwm95 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE
	+ "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

This technique was used in a more general way in AnotherLevel (before
/usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM came along) with a function called SwitchDecor in the
fvwm2rc.decors.m4 file:

	AddToFunc SwitchDecor
	+ "I" Exec echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE
	+ "I" Restart $1

called from

	AddToMenu Decorations
	+ "Decorations" Title
	+  "FVWM 95"    Function SwitchDecor Fvwm95 FVWM_BIN_NAME
	+  "Lesstif WM" Function SwitchDecor Mwm FVWM_BIN_NAME
	+  "Afterstep" Function SwitchDecor Afterstep afterstep

As you have your own RunWm script, perhaps the best approach for you is this
compromise:

	AddToMenu WindowManagers
	+  "" Title
	+  "Fvwm2 Win95-decors" Function SwitchDecor Fvwm95
	+  "Fvwm2 Mwm-decors" Function SwitchDecor Mwm
	+  "Thingy Foo" Function SwitchDecor Foo
	+  "Whatsit Bar" Function SwitchDecor Bar

	AddToFunc SwitchDecor
	+ "I" Exec echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE
	+ "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

Jos,

I just tried your script for making vector buttons, 'cause I would like to
make a "round" vector button (certainly nontrivial to do by hand since it
is quite subjective to discretization).  Any way, the perl script resulted
in negative numbers like this.

ButtonStyle 6 Simple -- UseTitleStyle
AddButtonStyle 6 2 50x50@0 -140x-20@0 
AddButtonStyle 6 4 50x50@1 -139x-20@1 -140x-20@1 -140x-20@1 

Ah... The beauty and complexity of Postscript.  Circles are so simple in
that language.

Any ideas?  Want the .fig file to play with?

What happened in 2.2.4 distribution to the TaskBar module that used to be in
2.2.2 and is used, for example, by AnotherLevel? Or I do I get an

Mmmm circles... Well, the script I made was just a quick hack, that only
parses polygons.  This covers the functionality of vector buttons, as they
also consist only of straigt lines. 

To make a cirlce, you'd have to just mimic it using a polygon. What you could do,
is just draw a green circle to act as a guide, and then draw your actual polygon
in black or red on top of this circle. (all colors but blue red and black are ignored
by the script)

Another possibility might be to use the button on the bottom left of the xfig 
window 'convert polygons splines etc...',  maybe this also converts a circle to 
a polygon? I don't know how this works. Please let me know if you find a way.

An idea (maybe slightly overdone, though) would be to use a 2d-mesh generator.
But, mmm maybe I'll include that in a next version of the script.

Hi there,

section 4.2 of the FAQ states, that it is not possible to use an FvwmButton
for an action as a whole when swallowing an Application.

Is this still true for recent Versions?

TIA for Info on this

Hi,

	I've got a few quick questions...

1) Is there a maximum number of allowable points which can be used in a
vector button?  Somewhere between 10 and 20 I get an error saying that it
was a "bad button style".

2) More is not necessarily better!  I wanted to draw a circle, so I wrote
a 5-line c-program to pick points on a circle at regularly spaced angular
increments.  This way I get, 3-> triangle, 4-> diamond or square, ... To
make a circle we want essentially a many sided polygoon.  As the number of
points increases for the same circle radius the button highlighting
becomes distorted.  That is the line becomes distorted.  It stands to
reason that if the input is higher resolution than can be displayed
nothing should happen; it should look just like the lower resolution
counterpart.


Without looking at the code I'd guess that this is caused by the
discretization error of using integers for what should really be a
floating point number (especially since it must be scaled to the titlebar
height).

( I can send examples if desired...)

The nicest circle I can come up with so far is 

#RoundButton: Limits 23-77, radius of 27
########################################
AddButtonStyle 6 \
	vector 9 69x31@0 77x50@0 69x69@0 50x77@0 31x69@0 \
	23x50@1 31x31@1 50x23@1 69x31@1

Pushing this up to a radius of 30 gives rise to funny dots in the
coordinate directions like this one.

#RoundButton: Limits 20-80, radius of 30
########################################
AddButtonStyle 6 \
	vector 9 71x29@0 80x50@0 71x71@0 50x80@0 29x71@0 \
	20x50@1 29x29@1 50x20@1 71x29@1

Manually editing the points to get rid of the points requires changing the
numbers to reflect the first round button like this before the points or
dots go away.

#RoundButton: Limits 20-80, radius of 30 (Manually edited...)
########################################
AddButtonStyle 6 \
	vector 9 71x29@0 77x50@0 71x71@0 50x77@0 29x71@0 \
	23x50@1 29x29@1 50x23@1 71x29@1

Any ideas??? The part which bothers me is that if I change the height of
the titlebar then the button appearance will most likely change so that
buttons which work good for me may not work well for others.

Finally one last question. (Wow, and I thought this was going to be
short...)  Is it possible to set the light and dark colors used for vector
buttons?  If not are they fixed or dependent on the button color.

Thanks,
Tom

Its still in the distribution.

It only builds when configure is run with "--enable-extras".

Nothing.  The TaskBar wasn't modified between 2.2.2 and 2.2.4.
If you don't have a specific reason to upgrade from 2.2.2 to
2.2.4 you can as well stick with your old fvwm.  There were
only a few minor bug fixes that don't justify upgrading if
you didn't encounter specific problems.

> Or I do I get an autohiding taskbar in 2.2.2?

If it were auto hiding you could still see it.  Probably the
task bar doesn't start up properly.  Can you find an error
message on the console?  Can you see it with 'ps'?

Bye

The limit is 20 in the 2.2.x series and 32 in the current CVS source.

How many pixels high are your title bar?

Even though the vector buttons are defined in units of 100, I'm guessing
that the button itself might be 20x20 pixels.

Given that a vector  is not a  pixel, but a instead  a line segment, I
think your going to find  it very difficult  to create a circle.  With
all  the  truncation going   on, even  if  there were  floating  point
calculations involved,  its  going  to be    pretty hard  to   get the
endpoints of the line segments in adjacent pixel locations.

I think I agree.

I don't think so, at least not in the 2.2.x. series.

Vector buttons are nice, but if you really want total control of the button
appearance, pixmaps are the way to go.  They don't resize, but you can
control every pixel, and use any color.

Actually, the button vector I described as working good for a circle is
not all that bad...  Maybe a little jagged, but I think I can live with
that.

Yes, I know, it's just the last part which I don't like.  Right now, I
kinda' like the vector buttons because the lines are so simple and the
last setup I had was getting a bit too fancy (I took pixmaps from
Enlightenment's Shiny Metal theme).  Actually, what's so difficult about
resizing?  I wrote a little code to resize pgm's and it was pretty easy.
(certainly easier than the stuff I see in the source code for fvwm2!)  I'm
not familiar with the xpm format; is that the tricky part?

Probably the hardest part would be to come up with the syntax and
implement the parsing.  Fvwm already has code to resize pixmaps. 
Results vary on what is being resized and the scale. 

Shrinking icons usually gives bad results.  You can try it out easily if
you have some 64x64 or 48x48 icons and used xv to shrink them to 16x16.

Expanding can be OK as long as the scale is small. 16x16 to 20x20 is OK,
some diagonal lines look wobbly, circles look weird.

Cheers,
Tim.

There was a bit of discussion last year about dialogs, mainly whilst
using Netscape.  The proposed solutions concentrated on getting focus
to the transient window.  One such way would involve warping the
pointer.

How about adding options for the placement of transients?  The
Netscape problem could be addressed with an option to place a
transient wherever the pointer is.  Other options could place a
transient inside or alongside its WM_TRANSIENT_FOR window.

ICCCM discourages user interaction when placing transient windows.  It
does not disallow automatic schemes.

Yes.  You can bind an action to the button label, though.

Say, is it still the case that fvwm2 is incapable of passing arguments to
scripts?

Hi,

  I don't recall where to send new vector buttons (yep, I checked the
archives).  Anyway, knowing little about what the values meant, several
months back I was able to create, through trial and error, a vector button
that looks like a push-pin which I use on a button that makes windows
Sticky/unSticky.  Use it if you like it.  :-)

ButtonStyle 7 10 25x20@1 30x25@1 30x55@1 43x55@0 50x85@1 57x55@0 \
                 70x55@0 70x25@0 75x20@0 25x20@1

Hello,

Can anyone tell me if there exist any tutorials on the .fvwm2rc file, I'd 
much rather like to learn the syntax and overall methodology and terminology 
(everything involved such as pagers, menus, vocab) instead of trying to 
half-blindly hack it every time I need something simple done (like changing 
the pager's color, or more importantly making the pager obstinately stay on 
top of everything, even Netscape).  Just a point in the right direction, 
don't need to be handheld, just something I can grasp the main idea and 
thought process from.

Thanks!

You know Dominik I think I've been watching this list for about a year
or 2 now and I just now figured out what that symbol is after your nam in
all of your e-mail messages is.

It's a cat isn't it...

Thanks for your reply. It addresses all of my problems, and with its help I
solved them (at the configure stage, I was using --prefix .. but not also
--exec_prefix)

Hi,
There is a rare but annoying problem I get when I go to 
resize or move a window over an rxvt. Sometimes it seems 
like the mouse click goes through the window I am resizing 
and selects some text in the rxvt below. This doesnt happen 
very often and seems to only happen when I grab the window 
at the very edge and move it fast. To more understand what 
I mean try this:

     Style Something StaysOnTop, FixedPosition

Then put an rxvt under the Something window and try to move 
the Something and the text below on the rxvt should get 
selected. (it also happens when I dont use the above Styles, 
but not as easily)

Is this normal?

thanks,
sa

[retry]
There was a bit of discussion last year about dialogs, mainly whilst
using Netscape.  The proposed solutions concentrated on getting focus
to the transient window.  One such way would involve warping the
pointer.

How about adding options for the placement of transients?  The
Netscape problem could be addressed with an option to place a
transient wherever the pointer is.  Other options could place a
transient inside or alongside its WM_TRANSIENT_FOR window.

ICCCM discourages user interaction when placing transient windows.  It
does not disallow automatic schemes.

When (re)starting fvwm2, I'd like mutt and slrn to start on page 0 1 and 0 2
of desktop 0, respectively. I've written the below init-restart.hook file (I
use Debian), but it doesn't do the trick: mutt and slrn start on page 0 0.

What's wrong with my syntax?

Thanks.

# This stuff is started each time fvwm2 is either started OR restarted.
# I'm going to have these always "on": 2 xterms, xjed and gkrellm. Also, I
# want mutt and slrn to start up, but on different pages of the desktop.

I guess I should interpret the silence on this as a resounding yes?

Hey, sometimes we have something else (e.g. work) to do instead

I'm thinking too.

I have yet to figure out what your asking about.

Is this in reference to scripts launched by the Exec command,
or FvwmScript, or some other kind of script?

And incidentally, yes, fvwm can accept args on PipeRead. It's been
able to for a while now... maybe since 2.3.0? Of course, it's still
not in a stable release, I believe. Or maybe it got added for 2.2.

What sort of arguments?  In what situation?  An example would help
clarify the question.

I have a script in my $HOME/bin/ directory which I execute from my
.xsession with a command something like

exec $HOME/bin/RunWM --FvwmFoo

This is essentially a reworked version of the RunWM script used by RedHat
to start the window manager from xdm.  The argument FvwmFoo causes fvwm2
to be started with the FvwmFoo decor.

In order to switch decor to FvwmBar the AnotherLevel package does a
restart calling the script RunWM.FvwmBar which is a symbolic link to
RunWM.  The script RunWM then checks to see how it was called or if it was
called by the name RunWM.FvwmBar or RunWM.Foo or what have you and chooses
the appropriate decor.

The annoying part is that every time I want to add another decor I have to
create another symbolic link, edit the RunWM script, as well as a few
other routines.  

There are two simple ways to get around this.

1) Pass an argument to the script.

2) Have two commands executed in sequence from a single menu selection
which essentially will do 

echo FvwmBar > $HOME/.wm_style 
exec RunWM

This is not the preferred alternative though since the RunWM script will
end up doing 

cat $HOME/.wm_style

meaning that the two commands need to be executed in order.

Does the "-cmd" or "-f" argument to fvwm help?  (First read the theme file,
have the theme file read the .fvwm2rc.)

Or you could export an environment variable and use it in a Read command.

I'm afraid I don't see how I could easily make use of these commands to
get the behavior I want.  The .fvwm2rc file is constructed with m4
preprocessing and the decor or theme is included at that level. Since
some of the style commands are order specific it could be a real
programming chore to extract out the decor which is mostly localized, but
has fingers into other parts...

Essentially for the m4 package to work I need to have the name of the
desired decor in the file $HOME/.wm_style.  The question is how to get the
name there.  Either pass it to a script which echo's it to the file and
does the restart or put it there and then do the restart from fvwm2 (in
that order).

>
>Or you could export an environment variable and use it in a Read command.

This looks like it should work but again the menu item chosen would need
to do two things, set an environment variable and restart fvwm.  If I
could make this work I couls also make other things work.

For example, in bash (and most other shells ) I can do composite commands
like cd /foo/bar ; echo hi > there ; cat there

Is it possible to use the Restart function to do this

Restart echo FvwmFoo > $HOME/.wm_style ; exec $HOME/RunWM

This would be ideal.

I don't think it's your syntax. If you are using ActivePlacement (probably)
then you might try adding

	GlobalOpts ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

This is supposed to be the default, but I have a feeling it isn't (it doesn't
appear to be for me right now in fvwm2-2.2.2-3).

Alternatively, you could add the RandomPlacement option on these Style lines:

	Style news* StartsOnPage 0 2, SkipMapping, RandomPlacement

Does my suggested solution of yesterday (Thu, 13 Jan 2000 02:48:59 GMT) not
work?

        AddToMenu WindowManagers
        +  "" Title
        +  "Fvwm2 Win95-decors" Function SwitchDecor Fvwm95
        +  "Fvwm2 Mwm-decors" Function SwitchDecor Mwm
        +  "Thingy Foo" Function SwitchDecor Foo
        +  "Whatsit Bar" Function SwitchDecor Bar

        AddToFunc SwitchDecor
        + "I" Exec echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE
        + "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

I believe the Exec is guaranteed to finish before the Restart begins (can
anyone confirm this?).

          Note that this function doesn't  wait  for  command  to

               Exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"

Hi -

I installed and configured fvwm as one of the window manager options in CDE,
under Solaris 2.6.  It seems to start up fine, I can change focus, execute
commands
in the windows, use the scroll bars and all that stuff, but I can't use the
mouse
to drag the windows around on the desktop.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?  I've
searched through a lot of the mailing list archives and checked the FAQ, but
haven't
come across anything that seems relevant.

Thanks,
Tom

True, but I've found that a Restart *appears* to wait for current Exec's to
finish. Thinking more about it, perhaps I was just being lucky!! Is a Restart
treated differently in this respect to any other fvwm2 command?

In other places where I want to wait for an Exec to complete before moving on,
I use PipeRead instead: so, one could try:

         AddToFunc SwitchDecor
         + "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE"
         + "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

Or even:

         AddToFunc SwitchDecor
         + "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE; echo Restart HOME/bin/RunWM"

(which now suggests one doesn't even need the function SwitchDecor, although
perhaps it's nicer than having the PipeRead repeated for each menu item).

Once you do an Exec, the actual execution is controlled by the OS.

I'm not  surprised that this  "mostly"  works.  A  typical echo  would
normally  complete long before fvwm  got around  to reading its config
files.

Both of these look like winners to me.

What did you put in your .fvwm2rc for moving windows?

I don't think there is anything built in for moving until you get to
some of our recent betas.


Here's one I like:

Mouse 2         W       M       Move

(Button 2 with the Meta key held down moves the window.)

Hi,

Sorry for not responding to this earlier.  John, I'm especially sorry for
not trying your suggestion yet.  So, I get varied results...

The first suggestion.

AddToFunc SwitchDecor
+ "I" Exec echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE
+ "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

I tried the first suggestion below, and it works for me, but I too was
afraid that it would be unreliable from the excerpt of the fvwm2 man page
which Dan mentioned.

>From the man page: 

	Note that this function doesn't  wait  for  command  to
	complete, so things like:

	     Exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"
	     Read /tmp/file

	won't work reliably.



>> In other places where I want to wait for an Exec to complete before moving on
>> I use PipeRead instead: so, one could try:
>> 
>>          AddToFunc SwitchDecor
>>          + "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE"
>>          + "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

This suggestion works just fine for me.  There is one interesting
difference from the first suggestion above.  I pipe stdout and stderr to
~/.FVWM2-errors with

fvwm2 -cmd 'FvwmM4 fvwm2rc.m4' > ~/.FVWM2-errors 2>&1

The first suggestion causes the output of subsequent restarts to be
appended to the file.  The second suggestion causes the file to be
overwritten.  There is definitely something going on here, but I'll be
damned if I know what...

The third suggestion gives me an error for some unknown reason.

>> Or even:
>> 
>>          AddToFunc SwitchDecor
>>          + "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE; echo Restart HOME/bin/
>> RunWM"

[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of '/home/tom/bin/RunWM' failed!!!! 
(restarting 'fvwm2' instead)

Anyone have an idea why???  I guess it doesn't matter, the second
suggestion works.  I should just use it and move on...

>> (which now suggests one doesn't even need the function SwitchDecor, although
>> perhaps it's nicer than having the PipeRead repeated for each menu item).

Now one last demonstration of my ignorance.

What does this mean?

       PipeRead cmd option
              Causes fvwm to read commands output from  the  pro-
              gram  named  cmd.   Useful  for building up dynamic
              menu entries based on a directories  contents,  for
              example.

So this caused fvwm2 to read the result of the echo command and do nothing
with it?

PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE"

Yes.

The echo caused HOME/USER_WM_STYLE to be created.
Since it didn't write anything to stdout, the command fvwm read
was blank.  Fvwm ignores blank commands.

> PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE"

The reason to use PipeRead instead of Exec is that fvwm is waiting for
the command results before proceeding.

Which is preferred?  FvwmGoodStuff or FvwmButtons.  I tried looking for
whether one replaced the other, but didn't see anything in the man
pages.

I tried getting FvwmGoodStuff to launch and then swallow an FvwmPager by
following the example in the man page, but I had no success with it.

Thanks for any help with this. . .

That's odd: one would expect BOTH to overwite the file, as the fvwm2 process
is being replaced by a new instance of RunWM, which is then replaced
(presumably) by a new instance of fvwm2.

On the other hand, a simple Restart, or Restart fvwm2 (I think) does NOT
replace the current process, merely `restarts' it: so the output is appended.
Perhaps when you tried the first method it was really somehow just doing a
Restart fvwm2?

Ah yes! I've seen this one before. Was your error really:

	[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of '/home/tom/bin/RunWM
	' failed!!!!
	(restarting 'fvwm2' instead)

i.e. a new line inside the quotes?

The text I suggested should have had a -n on the second echo:

	+ "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE; echo -n Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

I don't know why -- can anybody explain? The trailing newline from the
PipeRead gets treated as part of the name of the process for the Restart
command. Is this a bug?

Yes!  I thought it was just a funny syntax for the error message...

Damn... That's good.  How'd you figure that one out?

Isn't this like asking if the reading is buffered or not?

It depends on what version of FVWM you're using.  FvwmGoodStuff is
obsolete as of FVWM 2.2 and better.

Older versions didn't have FvwmButtons (FvwmGoodStuff was renamed and
significantly enhanced).

Restart what? X? fvwm? FvwmButtons?

You don't need that.  The modules are always killed anyway when
fvwm exits/restarts.  Any modules that do not exit can't talk to
fvwm anymore.

Mail the config file to me and I'll look into it (yes, I know
you have set it up on the web, but still).

FvwmGoodStuff is still maintained as far as I know, but it's
not in the fvwm distribution.  If you want to make sure that
your button bar always runs with current fvwm releases you
should use FvwmButtons.

I am aware of this problem.  It has been introduced with
2.3.10, but I still couldn't figure it out.  I'm working
on it.

You can set them using 'decors'.  You can find an example in
the file sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples in the distribution.
(Example from Martin Cartwright).

*But* this won't work anymore with the next release.  This
feature will come back eventually, but most likely not in
any of the 2.4.x releases (current beta version is 2.3.13).

Hi,

I just finished my blackbox2fvwm script, which translates
blackbox setup files to fvwm2 setup files. An example result,
fvwm2 running the 'Simple_Elegance' theme:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/BB.jpg

(Note that the toolbar on the bottom of the screen is fully 
functional, it has a clock, an iconmanager and a pager ;-)
I'll relesase the script soon. When working on the script, it 
struck me, that it would be possible to also produce a Windowmaker-
like look, without much extra effort. This now looks like this:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/WM.jpg

The toolbar in the top right of the screen is FvwmWharf.
Howver, the iconmanager in the bottom right of the screen
doesn't display icons yet. I tried to do this using the
option for displaying mini icons, but that didn't work very
well. Will the option to display icons be included in the
future? Or maybe someone has another suggestion on how to 
mimic this behaviour.

Best regards,


Jos.

Tom, 

This seemed to simple since it sounds like you know your way around your
rc file but could you do something like

AddToFunction MyRestart
+ "I" echo $1
+ "I" Restart $HOME/RunWM

AddToMenu RestartMenu
+ "I" MyRestart FvwmFoo
+ "I" MyRestart FvwmBar

That would call a function that could do both.

Brad,

Thanks for the suggestions.  Variants of this were proposed by John Latham 
and Dan Espen. (Many thanks again!)  What you call MyRestart they called
SwitchDecor and the suggestions were

AddToFunc SwitchDecor
+ "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE"
+ "I" Restart HOME/bin/RunWM

AddToFunc SwitchDecor
+ "I" PipeRead "echo $0 > HOME/USER_WM_STYLE; echo -n Restart HOME/bin/RunWM"

, the PipeRead guaranteeing the order of execution.  Both word great. 
Quite honestly I guess I just don't yet understand the fvwm2 _way_ of
doing things since I'm learning by basicaly hacking on the AnotherLevel
package which appears to  be a bit out of date (eg. not a single PipeRead
statement exists in the version of AnotherLevel I'm using!).  Well, all in
due time...

Thanks,
Tom

Dpending on how far through your AnotherLevel hack you are, it may well be
worth you taking a look at AnotherLevelUp, the package I announced last week.
Lots of PipeReads there (e.g. for changing preferences sets). It's still got
marked most of the places where I have made changes from AnotherLevel, which
might help you! (Although I intend to tidy that up in a future release.)

I've gotten most of the basics configured, but can't seem to get buttons on the
title bar of my windows.  I've been through the FAQ and the man pages, but must
be
missing something.  Here's the part of my .fvwm2rc file that I thought would
set them up:

Style "*" DecorateTransient,ClickToFocus,MWMButtons,MWMFunctions,MWMBorder, Butt
on 1, Button 2, Button 4, Button 6
ButtonStyle 1 - MWMDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 2 - MWMDecorMax
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMin

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Tom

  I'd like to set <Ctrl-Open> to Maximize 0 80 (I've currently got it 0
100) because I don't want the window to obscure my xticker, which sits
top-left.

  However, I can't make Maximise put the window anywhere but the top of
the screen (just what I don't want). I thought maybe I could do Maximise 0
-20, but it seems -20 is /synonymous/ with 80.

  Any ideas? I know I could probably wangle a Resize to do the job, but
then I couldn't toggle it back.


  On a similar note, if I resize/move a maximised window, it loses it's
maximised status, when I'd expect Maximise to still toggle it back to
where it was. Is this the intended functionality?

You could 'maximize -20' and then move it to -0-0.

  But then it goes to the bottom-right (insetad of retaining it's X ord.)
*and* I can't toggle it back!

  Oh well, never mind. I'll live with it till 2.4, and then I can maybe
think of a way to add it.

  Is there (I can't see anything) something I can, say, bind to <Meta-V>
in order to 'quote' the next keypress - i.e., send the next key to the
app. instead of have fvwm process it's binding.

  E.g., I've bound the Sun 'Front' key to RaiseLower. I'd like, sometimes,
to send that key as-is into, say, an xterm (or one of my meta bindings
into an app that uses it).

Only the maximised window is moved.

No, you *can* toggle it back.  The 'maximised' state is only turned
off when you *resize* the window, not when you move it.  Try it out,
it works.

  Except - to get it to work from a bound Function:

AddToFunc Down-Maximise \
  "I" Maximise $0 $1
+ "I" WindowId $w (!Maximized)  Move 0w -0

  ... will *only* work in a binding. OK, that's fair enough. If I
FvwmCommand it, the Maximise asks for the window to be clicked upon, but
the WindowId command won't know what window that was. Doesn't matter.

Actually you can rewrite your function like this:

  AddToFunc Down-Maximise
  + I Maximize $0 $1
  + I Move 0w -0

In theory this function should ask for a window to operate on once
and then use it for 'Maximize' and for 'Move', but apparently is
doesn't.  Seems to be a bug.

  Would be useful if it worked - but not in this case; I only want to do
the move when Maximising, not minimising. The above would always move the
window to the bottom, nomatter the toggle state.

  Current (the window with input focus) isn't necessarily the one I'm
doing it to :-)  [I've tried that, and it was most odd - one max'd,
another moved!]

  It is indeed! When did that appear, then? Or has it been lurking there
the whole time (like most options one wants :-) )?

Has anybody noticed a problem with decorating transients?  I took out
the `DecorateTransient' from the sample system.fvwm2rc file and my
transients are still decorated.  I then tried `NakedTransient' with no
success.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks in advance. . .

I have to admit that it's been ages since I last used fvwm.  However,
I'm thinking of switching back, mostly because I'm getting tired of a
lot of the bloat that's going around in the newer window managers and
because I'm intrigued by some of fvwm's new features.

So, I'm hoping that some kind soul(s) will be able to answer some of my
questions.

1. Is it possible for desktops to remember which of their windows was in
focus?  That way if I jump from desktop to desktop, the window which had
focus before will have focus again, regardless of where the mouse is.

2. I've noticed support for gtk and imlib in the lastest snapshots.  Is
it possible to have "more graphical" titlebars now?  Something like one
that is only half or a third as wide as the window.

Thanks in advance...

Let's try an anarchistic approach:

  http://www.crosswinds.net/~fvwmrc

just ftp to this address ftp.crosswinds.net, login and pass: fvwmrc, 
and create a subdirectory to upload your stuff.

  I've been using raised titles & buttons, giving 3D borders on the
titlebar and each button.

  What I'd like to do is have a raised titlebar with flat buttons, but
when I set this up what I get is a raised title-bar only as far as the
buttons, then it goes flat. (i.e., I only get the hi/lo-light lines on the
title bar where there's not button.

  Am I missing something, or can't it be done?

It can't be done.  The titlebar doesn't go under the buttons, it stops
where they start.  A hacky way to get the look would be to remove the
relief pixels between the raised titlebar and raised buttons (a bit like
HiddenHandles for BorderStyle). I don't know what you would call this
either.

Cheers,
Tim.

  I suspected as much; it also shows up when one tries to have a pixmap
tile on the titlebar. Buttons will inherit this property as a background,
but restart the tiling each time, making most XPMs look most dodgy.
Ideally, ButtonStyle UseTitleStyle would cause the titlebar to draw its
background (3D/pixmap/etc.) across the button area, so that tiled pixmaps
are only tiled 'once'.

  Then, though, you have the problem of coping with title text placement,
and possibly mixtures of buttons that do usetitletyle and those that don't
(although you could insist that all such buttons would supply their own
b/g which would overwrite the title stuff underneath them, which I think
is always the case anyway).

Yes, but it takes some functions and it can lose track if you use the
Focus command instead of the FlipFocus command.  Here's how I do it, I
don't use virtual pages, just multiple desks and I use Sloppy Focus. Any
other combinations may not work. This also relies on having a sticky
FvwmButtons so that when switching desks the cursor does not land on a
random window. Alt-F9 to Alt-F12 will swith between desks 0-3.

DeskTopSize 1 1

Style * SloppyFocus

DestroyFunc my_home
AddToFunc my_home I Next (FvwmButtons CirculateHit) WarpToIndow 50 50

DestroyFunc my_flipfocus
AddToFunc my_flipfocus  I Iconify Off
+                       I WindowShade Off
+                       I FlipFocus
+                       I Raise
+                       I WarpToWindow 50 50

DestroyFunc my_gotodesk
AddToFunc my_gotodesk   I my_home
+                       I Desk 0 $0
+                       I Prev (CurrentDesk !Iconic) my_flipfocus

Key F9          A       M       my_gotodesk 0
Key F10         A       M       my_gotodesk 1
Key F11         A       M       my_gotodesk 2
Key F12         A       M       my_gotodesk 3

This will fall apart if any command results in a "Next Focus" as that
will scramble the windowlist order.  If you want to see the windowlist
in action run FvwmWinList
as a sticky window with the *FvwmWinListFollowWindowList option.

GTK/Imlib is only used in the FvwmGtk module which does menus and forms,
it does not do window decoration. Fvwm doesn't do shaped title bars.
"more graphical"? well, with AddTitlestyle you can add layer upon layer
of shaped pixmaps to the titlebar to get very complex looks. About the
only this you can't do is to stretch pixmaps and shape the window
border.

Cheers,
Tim.

Your ftp does not set the transfer type on BINARY by default :(

O :-) well, it was just an idea really.. I just tried to upload
something, and I noticed it was quite slow. If you think it's still
a good idea to have such a site, I think I'll just put it on 
my pc at work, which is connected permanently to the internet.

Jos.

Okay, there a few things I'm lost on.  I'm hoping that someone can
answer my newbie questions.

First, I'm trying to bind "alt-m" to windoze-style window cycling.  You
know, "alt-tab" switches between the last two focused windows and
continuous "alt-tab" cycles through all the windows.  I've tried the
following, but to no avail:

    Key Tab    A M    Prev FlipFocus "Next Focus"

I've also tried "Next/Prev (*)/[*] Focus" but it seems that as soon as
it hits the "Prev FlipFocus" it stops right there.  I thought about a
function with a "Wait", but the way I read it, it wants a window-name,
and giving it (*) will just do more of the same.  Any pointers?

Second, is the FvwmGtk module capable of reading .gtkrc?  I've defined
my root menu and then do a "SendToModule FvwmGtk MenuFvwmRoot 1" but it
ends up looking the same.

Also, is there a repository of sample .fvwm2rc files that cover these
"newer" features?  I've hit the pages off the "Links" section of
www.fvwm.org, but all this info seem rather dated.

As always, thanks in advance...

Key	Tab	A	M	Next [*] focus
Key	Tab	A	SM	Prev [*] focus

Nah, that's exactly what I don't want.  With one "alt-tab" press, I want
to flipfocus, with multiple ones in a row, I want to cycle my focus.

Hello!

I'm trying to implement something that lets me have different keyboard
layouts (us, swedish, etc) in different windows and also an easy hotkey to
swich the current layout. Just as it is possible to have in MS Windows.

I've tried to put together a configuration with the FvwmEvent module and
xmodmap. Tracking focus switches and calling xmodmap works OK, but I can't
figure out how to find out which window that was activated so I can select
the approriate keyboard map.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how this could be solved? Any input
would be greately appreciated.

Regards,
Fredrik Ohrn

You can't get FVWM to work exactly like Windows.

The latest 2.3.x pretests do it this way:

  * Alt-TAB brings up a window list.

  * More Alt-TAB's will cycle through the list.

  * You have to press RET (e.g.) to select the window you want; letting
    up the keys doesn't do anything.

I think what you want is a bit more subtle. When you say multiple ones
in a row don't you mean repeated hits of the TAB key without letting go
of the ALT key? It's impossible in fvwm.  The nearest you can get is
using the built in WindowList menu (see the FAQ question 3.3
http://www.fvwm.org/generated/FAQ.html )

Cheers,
Tim.

I'm using fvwm2-2.2.2-3

I have several programs (like Netscape) which I run during InitFunction and would like them to pop-up at specific locations and sizes on different desks within FVWMPager.  For example, I have Desks 0 thru 3 and would like Netscape to load to Desk 1 with a certain size and location without Focus moving to Desk 1.

I define the Style like:

Style   "Netscape"      Icon mini-nscape.xpm, SkipMapping, StartsOnDesk 1

...add a Function call within the InitFunction

DestroyFunc "InitFunction"
AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+       "I"     Function SpawnNetscape

...and have the Function defined as

DestroyFunc "SpawnNetscape"
AddToFunc "SpawnNetscape"
+       "I"  Next [Netscape] Move 12p 20p
+       "I"  Exec exec /usr/local/netscape/netscape
+       "I"  Prev [Netscape] Maximize 91 89

Netscape pop's up on the correct desk and focus doesn't change but the Move and Maximize commands are "ignored".  I've shuffled things around a couple of different ways like:

DestroyFunc "SpawnNetscape"
AddToFunc "SpawnNetscape"
+       "I"  Next [Netscape] Move 12p 20p
+       "I"  Next [Netscape] Maximize 91 89
+       "I"  Exec exec /usr/local/netscape/netscape

But that doesn't work either.  I also used FvwmIdent to find the correct Class (Netscape) and Resource (Navigator) and neither work.  Most programs are easy because of  "-geometry".

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Pat

That's because fvwm doesn't wait for the netscape window to appear
before continuing the function.  The 'Wait' command can do this,
but it's a dangerous thing.  If no window with the given name
ever appears you can hang fvww (I think there's a key combination
to bug out of this, but I don't know which).

Time to reply!

Quoting Patrick Cevasco (pcevasco@altavista.com):

Well unless I've not understood the question, but netscape just support the
-geometry argument.  Why not use that?

Dang!!!

I don't suppose anyone is planning on adding this feature?  It's like
the only decent feature of that "other" GUI and it greatly accelerates
everything.  8(

No one knows what your doing wrong either, unless you send US some
examples :-)

I'm really no expert but here is a simple one:

*FvwmGtkRCFile /usr/share/gtkrc
*FvwmGtkMenu Rxvt
*FvwmGtkTitle "The Menu"
*FvwmGtkItem "ouR X Vitual Terminal" "Exec exec rxvt"
Mouse 3 R A SendToModule FvwmGtk Rxvt
module FvwmGtk

HTH,

Patrick, the mail address you use seems not to work.  If somebody

Please double check your mail setup.

The linux-kernel lists were recently hit with a similar problem; someone
signed up and then started forwarding the mail to a bunch of other people.
This is impossible to prevent as we have no control over what happens to
the mail after it leaves the list host, but it is also trivial to track
down given a complete set of headers.  Complaints about mailing list mail
that don't include complete headers are essentially useless.

Thanks, this was a big help.  Just one other question, any idea how to
draw a line in the menu in order to give the semblance of a separator?
You know, something like the "Nop" under the regular menus?

Hi

Fvwm understands some 'intuitive' color names like 'yellow'
or 'grey90' etc. Is it possible to somehow convert these to
rgb values? I looked in the cpan archive, but couldn't find
any perl scripts that do this. Does anyone know if there is 
a program around that can?

best regards,

Jos.

The mappings are stored in a file 'rgb.txt'.  At least on
my systems you can find it at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt

It's not that dangerous. Fvwm will happily carry on managing windows
while it is waiting for the window to appear, you can pop up menus and
use key bindings.  All a Wait command does is to stick the rest of the
functions into a list of things to do when the window appears.  The root
cursor will change into a stopwatch while it is waiting and you can
interrupt it with Ctrl-Alt-Escape.

The function to massage netscape is:

DestroyFunc SpawnNetscape
AddToFunc SpawnNetscape I Exec exec /usr/local/netscape/netscape
+ I Wait Netscape
+ I Next [Netscape] Move 12p 20p
+ I Next [Netscape] Maximize 91 89

Cheers,
Tim.

If you've got gnome around, then there's a "color browser" in the Gnome
Panel "Utilities" menu. It'll do what you want (play with the
options). You can also just look at the flat file /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt (or
wherever location it may be on your system). It should have the decimal
values there, it's a flat file.

I don't think it will happen. Fvwm only reacts to key presses and this
would require it to listen for key releases and be able to bind
sequences to functions. How would you specify this behaviour in a
.fvwm2rc?

There are ways of getting around the desktop quickly. The FAQ has a
method that makes hitting alt-tab twice quickly work like the quick
alt-tab in Windows:

DestroyFunc my_dbltab2
AddToFunc my_dbltab2 "I" WindowListFunc $w
DestroyFunc my_dbltab
AddToFunc my_dbltab "I" Prev (CurrentDesk) my_dbltab2
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry my_dbltab

If you bind the keypad Enter instead of Alt-Tab it gets a bit quicker:

Key KP_Enter A N WindowList Root c c CurrentDesk NoGeometry my_dbltab

Another method that may give even better results is to use FvwmIconMan
and write some functions/bindings to get it to focus to specific buttons
e.g. Alt-F1 could send a message to FvwmIconMan that would make Fvwm
Switch focus to the first window in the FvwmIconMan list, Alt-F2 to the
second etc. Since FvwmIconMan is always visible you could decide which
window to go to and just hit the appropriate key.  If you arrange the
FvwmIconMan window carefully you may even get it to arrange the windows
straight above the functions keys and you won't even have to count, just
hit the key beneath the FvwmIconMan button.

heers,
Tim.

Anyone figure out a kludge (or write code) to do pinnable transient windows

Hello,

Lately I've been having the following error message in
my ~/.xsession-errors file:

[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap )

Any ideas as to what in my script could be causing this?
All the pixmaps I reference seem to pop up fine.

Thanks,

Neil

Thats produced by the menu logic and the pixmap name is ")".

Look for a menu definition line with a ")" that is out of place.

The diagnostic messages would be much more helpful if a line number
was shown for I cannot find the misplaced ). I guess I'll just have
to look harder.

Thanks,

Neil

OK, I found the bug. I have a menu entry that looks like this:

+                           "blah (*)" Exec /usr/local/bin/blah

I actually want the (*) to appear literally on my menu with the
rest of the string. How do I do this?

Thanks,

Neil

Bet you know by now "man fvwm2":

          If the menu-label contains a sub-string  which  is  set
          off  by  stars,  then  the  text  between  the stars is
          expected to be the name of an xpm-icon  or  bitmap-file
          to  insert  in  the menu.  To get a literal '*', insert
          '**'.For example

Um, can you explain what you mean with 'pinnable windows'?  I don't
have olwm handy right now.  You know, it's a fvwm list ;-)

  OK, having re-read the manual page, and scanned through border.c, I
finally think I understand how these states should work, and I think they
should do what I want. However, they don't (!).

  What I *want* is for my maximise button to have a standard tiled pixmap,
with another pixmap on top, this top pixmap to change dependant upon the
maximised status of the window. Gottit?

  Here's what I use:

AddToDecor StandardDecor  ButtonStyle All  -- UseTitleStyle Raised
...
AddToDecor StandardDecor  AddButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMax  \
         ActiveUp           (  \
            Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ActiveDown         (  \
            Solid White)
         ToggledActiveUp    (  \
            Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm)  \
         ToggledActiveDown  (  \
            Solid White)

  AFAIUI, this should:

 - set the MWM flag stating that it's a maximise button (which I think it
does)

 - set solid white for the button-depressed state whether toggled max. or
not (it only does this for !max - when maximised, holding clicker-1 down
doesn't make it go white)

 - set the "on" pixmap whem !max, and set the "off" when max. (I actually
get the default MWM 'square' vector, not my pixmap. Mind you, it *does*
toggle correctly when max/!max).


  What I've missed out is the generic non-active pixmap. If I add that as
a default, I lose the default square & only have *it*, not the ones I've
specified (which, as I've said, seem to not work anyway).


  Thinking about it now, though: "ToggledActiveUp" ... surely that implies
it'll only display diff. toggled statuses when the window's active!?


  I'm suspecting at this point that it *isn't* working right, but I'd like
some confirmation: is anyone else actually *using* this style??

It will work perfectly if you remove the syntax errors.  Looking
at the console output when trying such commands might help too ;-)

'-' options belong at the end of the AddButtonStyle command

The backslash is missing.

The right command is:

  AddButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp          (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm) \
                   ActiveDown        (Solid White) \

                   ToggledActiveDown (Solid White) \
                 - MWMDecorMax

:-) My recommendation: don't use it.  All this ...Style stuff will be
rewritten for 3.0 anyway :-)

There is a fvwm/scwm module called FvwmKb by Alexander Vorobiev.
I think this already does what you want.  It doesn't have a home
page, but you can find it at

  I do not think that's what the window manager does, that's the widget
toolkit's responsibility.

  note:

  - there are applications with tearable menus, they work fine under fvwm
(pavuk, check the www.freshmeat.net if you want to see it in action)

  - netscape has the find dialog, it stays on the screen until you close it
(and you can use netscape in the meantime), so it's basically 'pinned'

  - the openwin programs' menus are pinnable under fvwm (just tried it)

  the only think fvwm could do is to make it's own menus/dialogs pinnable.

  the netscape's understanding of the geometry seems to be pretty wierd, I
have tried various geometry setting and they do not work as described in X
man page, the same geometry settings work fine with other X programs.

Here are the geometry lines from the 4.6 Netscape.ad file:

! By default, the geometries of components (browsers, mail, address book, etc)
! are saved in ~/.netscape/preferences.js.  If this pisses you off, uncomment
! the following line and Netscape will not remember component geometries.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-dont-save-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*dontSaveGeometryPrefs:		True
!
! Uncomment the following line to ignore any geometry preferences that
! might have been saved.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-ignore-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*ignoreGeometryPrefs:			True
! Geometry
!
! Here's how you set the default sizes and positions of the Netscape windows:
!
! For the web browser window:   Netscape.Navigator.geometry: =500x700+100-0
! For the mail reader:          Netscape.Mail.geometry: =500x800+200-0
! For the news reader:          Netscape.News.geometry: =500x800+300-0
! For the mail editor:          Netscape.Composition.geometry: =400x600
! For the bookmarks window:     Netscape.Bookmarks.geometry: =300x900-0-0
! For the address book window:  Netscape.AddressBook.geometry: =600x900-300-0
! For the download windows:     Netscape.Download.geometry: =500x200-0-0
!
! In previous versions of Netscape, we suggested setting the geometry on the
! TopLevelShell class; don't do that any more.  It will affect *all* of the
! top-level Netscape windows, including bookmarks and message composition and
! so on, which is probably not what you want.


As you can see from this, they don't recommend setting an overall geometry.
Putting one on the command line probably qualifies.

Anyway, you may find something helpful in the above information.

  if you are talking about the pins in the menus, they are definitely part
of the menus and not the olwm decors. run the openwin program (cmdtool, or
any other) in fvwm and you'll see the pins are there (right click in the
cmdtool main menu and try the menus, some have pins).

  there might be other pins that are part of olwm decors.

> <   - the openwin programs' menus are pinnable under fvwm 
> (just tried it)
>

  using the pin, it is displayed no matter what window manager you use. only
for openwin programs, of course.

  for those who do not know/have olwm: in lot of menus there is a button
(with pin picture) as a first item in the menu, when you select it, the menu
stays open (as a regular window) even after you select other item (it is
usefull to have some menus handy all the time, like edit menu etc...)).

  if you use olwm these pinned window have pin in the title, you can use it
to close the window. in fvwm these have regular title, you can close it
using whatever method you use to close windows. I guess you could write a
special style for these pinned windows (to have pin icon in the title), but
I am not sure how would you find out the window is pinned.

  off topic.

  does this mean you basically cannot open two instances of netscape and use
different geometry for each???

You have the memory to run 2 copies of Netscape?

Since its saving preferences in $HOME, you should be able to trick the
second copy into using a different $HOME.

Anyway, you're right, off topic.

Open the Find/Replace window (which you can get from the cmdtool menu.
In olwm, you can pin this F/R window, keeping it from vanishing after a find.

That pin is absent in fvwm.

I've been trying to make my windows look more MWM-like, in the sense that I 
want the bevel width around the borders to be 1 pixel. In MWM, the windows 
look almost flat, whereas the default in FVWM 2.2.2 is that they look more 
3D-like.

I have almost managed to do so, using:

Style "*" MWMBorder

which makes all bevels 1 pixel, except the one on the outside of a window 
(it's still 2 pixels wide).

Is there a parameter/option to explictly set the width of the bevels?

  I see what you mean - some pins are in the widget themselves (in the
menus), some are in the decorations.

  still, it looks like the window itself controls if it is pinned (there is
no way for window manager to pin the window that is not aware of it). do you
plan to use a lot of openwin programs?

Fvwm pays attention to all the Open Look hints its is aware of.

  hmm... I always thought that openwin is basically dead, even sun went to
CDE, even though you still get the openwin part, right? and nobody else
supports openwin much, or do they?

I've already tried it and it doesn't help.  I can't see a hint
in decorations.c that looks like it.

  D'Oh!  I noticed that about half an hour after I posted :)  (my console
xterm's normally hidden behind my xticker, & I forgot to check it)

  Still not working quite right, but I'm a lot closer than I was! The
other thing I was missing was a ToggledInactive stae setting. 

  For ref., if I get it working perfectly, I'll post it for any interested
parties.

First, I want to thank everyone for answering what may have seemed like
silly questions.  I really appreciated it.

I discovered why I was having such difficulty with this module.  Turns
out that there's an error in the man page.  So, all the stuff that I
kept asking stupid questions about was in the part that man/troff
couldn't generate.

Silly me didn't finally notice this until tonight.  Anyway, here's a
patch:

Would this work:

Style "*"           BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 1

Gives me a nice one pixel border.

I think Joe was referring to the width of the bevel, which is hilighted. 
(Color calculated from HilightBack, for a hilighted window) I might try 
some ascii art to show this:


**************************************  \
*                bevel                   |
*  ***********************************   | entire border
*  *             the other part          |

*  *    ******************************  /
*  *    *
*  *    *
*  *    *
*  *    *

*  *    *

What's wrong with the built in 'ToggledInactive' state?

I can't run mwm, but dtwm which is a close relative looks exactly like
this. The last time I looked at mwm it was this way too.

?

If you want a mouse click when you press a mouse button
you don't need to emulate it.  Or do you want to emulate
mouse buttons with the keyboard?  In this case, there is
a section in our FAQ:

------------------------------- snip ------------------------------
3.5  You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
     presses?

A: Although fvwm has commands for binding movements to keystrokes,
   controlling the pointer with the keyboard should really be handled by
   the X server. The following is an excerpt of the X FAQ on this topic:


      If you have the X Keyboard (XKB) Extension, you can enable mouse keys,
      which makes it possible to generate mouse motion and button events
      using the keyboard.   Events generated by MouseKeys are completely
      transparent -- they will work with any application that connects to a
      server that has the X Keyboard Extension, regardless of whether the
      application itself uses XKB.

      XKB is enabled by default in X11R6.1.

      First, set up the Num Lock key so that Shift+Num_Lock toggles mouse keys:

       xmodmap -e "keysym Num_Lock = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys"

      (XFree86 3.1.2E is based on R6.1 and has the X Keyboard Extension;
      it also has a binding to Pointer_EnableKeys in its default keymap.
      You use Alt+Shift+Num_Lock to toggle MouseKeys on and off.  If you
      are using an earlier release of X or XFree86, you won't have XKB and
      the instructions will not work. See http://www.XFree86.org/FAQ for
      more information.)

      You might also have to turn off server num lock for this to work.
      Now press "Shift+Num_Lock" to enable MouseKeys.  When MouseKeys are on:

      o)   The keypad arrow keys move the pointer
      o)   The keypad '5' key behaves like the 'default' pointer button
      o)   The keypad '0' key locks the default pointer button (for easy
           dragging)
      o)   The keypad '.' key unlock the default pointer button (to release
           a drag)
      o)   The keypad '+' key double-clicks the default pointer button.
      o)   The keypad '/' key sets the 'default' button to Button1
      o)   The keypad '*' key sets the default button to Button2
      o)   The keypad '-' key sets the default button to Button3

      This is the default configuration, but the mechanism allows for nearly
      infinite configurability.

I just pulled down and successfully built (making both static and shared
libraries) xpm 3.4k. It is installed in /u/asl/opt/usr/openwin (/bin include
include/X11 include/X11/X11 and /lib). When I run configure it can't find the

I'm on an ultra-sparc running SunOS 5.6 (== solaris 2.6). This is a box where I
cannot become root or install anywhere except under my home directory (/u/asl).

I've tried the following command line:
./configure --with-xpm-library=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib \
--with-xpm-includes=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include/X11 --prefix=/u/asl
--enable-extras

What can I do to make it work?

You would have to normally show us the errors.

Leave the X11 part off of the include path.

You're going to need "-R/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib" in your link editor
flags.  The whole process is explained in the INSTALL.fvwm file.

Which one wasn't found?  Look back up through the output.

There's no need to emulate the whole /usr/openwin path under your
directory (if you don't want to).  You could just as easily use
/u/asl/xpm/lib, /u/asl/xpm/bin, etc.

  dl> I've tried the following command line:
  dl> ./configure --with-xpm-library=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib \
  dl> --with-xpm-includes=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include/X11 --prefix=/u/asl
  dl> --enable-extras

I'll bet it's the header that wasn't found.  By tradition, X headers are
#included in the code as <X11/xpm.h>.  That means that whatever
directory you gave to --with-xpm-includes, the compiler will add
"/X11/xpm.h" to it to find the header.  You gave
/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include/X11, so the compiler will be looking for
/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include/X11/X11/xpm.h (note two X11's).  That
probably doesn't exist.

Change the configure line to use just
--with-xpm-includes=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include and see if that works
any better.

Xpm installed itself into /u/asl/opt/usr/openwin. The include/X11/X11 directory
really does exist. What it installed (under /u/asl/opt) is (ls -RF):

Hi there..

I'm new to the list.  I have successfully built and installed fvwm on an 
Ultra 10 workstation, but for some reason, no matter what changes I make to 
my fvwm2rc, I can't get the window background color to change to anything 
but white, and the text to anything but black.  I have plenty of colors 
left, i.e., i have no trouble running netscape with full colors, etc, and 
my windows do have a bit of color, i.e., the title bar does show up in 
color.  Any ideas why this might be?  Thanks.

-Michael

Um... If you're asking what I _think_ you're asking, those colours aren't
controlled by fvwm: xterm foreground/background is controlled by X
resources [xrdb -query to see what they are currently set to], and command
line options to xterm [for example]. Sorry if I've misunderstood...

If this is the way your installation looks, somethings wrong.

It should be:

usr/openwin/include/X11/xpm.h

I suggest starting over.  Get this part right before proceeding.

This part looks OK.  Strange.

As both Paul and I indicated, the "X11" part is no good.  Get the xpm library
to install right first.

As long as the include libs are messed up, I don't think its useful
to dig into this.

OK.

Go look in the config.log file after a failed configure run.  Look
through it until you find where it's testing for this.

If that doesn't help you figure it out, send us that section of the log
file.

Double-check that you don't have another, older xpm library installed
somewhere earlier on your link path.

I agree with Dan that this is kind of bogus; however, it should work.

I've seen people put symlinks like X11 -> . in their include/X11
directories, so they don't have to worry about this.  Then you can use
include/X11/X11/X11/X11/X11/xpm.h and it'll still work.

Not that I'm recommending that in any way, mind you :).  Symlink loops
are all kinds of hassle.  It's easier to just get the flags right.

  de> usr/openwin/include/X11/xpm.h

  de> I suggest starting over.  Get this part right before proceeding.

You could just move the xpm.h file, you don't need to reinstall or
anything.  There's no magic about the placement of this header.

But, I don't _think_ that's your problem based on your description.

Weird; your link line has two -lXpm's.  The first one is before the
-L/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib, so, it's not looking there for libXpm and
so it's not finding it, and it quits right there.

I vaguely recall this is a bug in the 2.2.x configure, where it puts
things in the wrong order during the test.  I'm pretty sure this is
fixed in the 2.3.x development sources.

Change your configure invocation to put both the -R and the -L in
LDFLAGS:

 $ LDFLAGS="-L/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib -R/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib" ./configure --with-xpm-library=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/lib --with-xpm-includes=/u/asl/opt/usr/openwin/include/X11 --prefix=/u/asl --enable-extras

and see if that helps.

As it was replied before, the settings for your xterm colours should be
put in $HOME/.Xdefaults...

here is an example of something I use (in .Xdefaults):

xterm*background: 	black
xterm*foreground: 	grey70
xterm*font: 		lucidasanstypewriter-12 	!set fonts
xterm*boldfont: 	lucidasanstypewriter-bold-12
xterm*geometry: 	80x40				!set size (chars)
!for rxvt:
rxvt*background: 	Darkslategrey
rxvt*foreground: 	Wheat

Hi!
I started using 2.3.12 and now .13, for the 2.2.* series FvwmAuto module
seems to have a bug fixed in 2.3.* with not bringing to top e.g. netscape
middle clicked (open in new window) windows.

Now 2.3.13 works fine, except that sometimes the FvwmAuto module isn't
started. When I do a restart Fvwm2 then it is. Also some of my Applets which
should be swallowed and started by FvwmButtons aren't executed.
Here is my Init section:

+			  "I" exec Esetroot -scale /root/tolkien/movie/ringsart6.jpg
+  		      "I" Module  FvwmAuto 555 Raise Nop
+             "I" Module FvwmWinList
+             "I" Exec astime -bg "#266294" -fg yellow -day white -date white -ampm white -sec lightgreen -fh -nh -geometry -8-8 -exe xcalendar
+             "I" Exec ascpu -u 1 -bg "#266294" -fg yellow -position -5-69 -exe xcalendar
+             "I" Exec asmem -used -bg "#266294" -fg white -position -5-133
+             "I" Exec aterm -sh 66 -sl 333 -geometry 90x14-70-0 +vb -tr -trsb -fg grey84 -T "X Messages" -fn "-b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -e tail -c 16384 -f /var/log/messages

Note that the exact same init section works fine with 2.2.*

Cheers,
		Fabian.

For everyone's information, here's an explanation of the problem.

An address from chinamist.com joins ages ago.  A year ago, said address
leaves the company but the account is never disabled and nobody ever
bothers to send a bounce back to your humble list owner so that the address
can be removed.

Our rude poster here decides to have his server configured to send all
inbound mail for unknown addresses to him at some home.com address.

I and piles of other folks start getting request to stop sending messages
to this home.com address.  Of course, it's not on the list.  We have no
idea what's going on, but I ask for full headers.  I get back a big pile of
Subject:, To:, From:, CC:, Date:, etc.  but not a single useful Received:
header.

Eventually this guy by chance sends a message to me with his Reply-To: set
to the chinamist.com address.  I do a quick grep and nuke any chinamist.com
addresses.  All is quiet.
 
He also asked me to pass on his apologies for his rudeness.

 - J<
