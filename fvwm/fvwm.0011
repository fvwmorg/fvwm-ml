  Looks like they've been made unavailable to the general public :-/

  You can still google-cache 'em though (sans images), and I've saved
those two off for reference in case google had a flush. Dunno whether it's
allowable/feasable to have abbreviated copies on fvwm.org somewhere.

I can try.  I'm a bit of a Java novice though.

Using your sample program, I was unable to get ALT-F  to pull down the
file menu the same as you.  I ran Java traces, and the keys
are clearly getting to the Java app.

After reading some docs, I tried hitting F10 instead.  Sure enough,
F10 will make the file menu pull down.

What this seems to be related to is something Java calls "LookAndFeel".
The values for this seem to be: "Motif", "Windows", "Mac", "Metal"

In Fvwm's case, it seems to be using "Metal".  I think thats where
the F10 comes in.

I don't understand the LookAndFeel class docs well enough to know
if you can set the LookAndFeel yourself.  I don't know yet, how
Gnome/Enlightenment manage to convince Java to use a different
LookAndFeel either (if thats whats happening).

Perhaps someone on this list can correct me, or if I'm on the right
track, supply some more input.

Thanks for any hint!

Style "Fvwm Pager"	NoHandles

Won't stop an explicit resize from the window-ops menu, if you have one, 
but it does mean you can't accidentally grab and stretch the pager.

This assumes of course, that none of the mouse buttons are bound to any
resize functions in context 'S'. For example, I have:

Mouse	1	TS	A	move-or-raiselower
Mouse	2      	FIST	A	window_ops_func
Mouse	3      	TSIF	A	move-or-lower-or-iconify

It's never come up before, that I remember. In the meantime, perhaps
using CVS might be useful? Look at the cvs docs on
http://www.fvwm.org/cvs.html and use the -r flag when checking out or
updating to get a specific release. I believe that this might satisfy
your desire to download patches only, though I'm not positive.

I'm currently using FVWM2[.2.4] and have been recently working on
creating my own .fvwm2rc (prior to now, I was just using the defaults).
One thing that's rather annoying is that when I go to resize a window
(say, a rxvt), it goes to the "rubber bands" and allows me to resize it.
However, any other process that's working at that time gets stopped. My
'top' windows stop, 'cmatrix' halts, and even xmms will stop playing
after it's used up its buffer. Can I keep FVWM2 from doing this or is
this a feature-bug?

The rubber bands are "XOR"'d onto the background.  The XOR operation is
reversible, that is, if you do it twice, the background comes back to
its original color.  Fvwm has to grab the XServer during this operation
because anyone else drawing where the XORs have been done will mess up
the second XOR.

There might be other ways of putting the rubber bands on the screen,
but they would be a lot slower, so I think its a feature.

Why can't I get it to show the window as it's resized rather than the
rubber bands? I'd actually prefer that behavior over taking over the
machine for such a simple operation (or so it seems).

	Yes, you can. I've done that in the past to get around some quirks in
the Metal implementation. I was about to send a short code snippet
illustrating how, but see below.

	I thought Dan was on the right track, but I tried the program on my
system and both Alt-F and F10 bring up the File menu just fine...no
fiddling with xmodmap, nor with the Pluggable LookAndFeel. Dan, you may
well be on the right track, but I can't reproduce the problem.

	I'm running JDK 1.2 (the Blackdown Linux port, from sometime early this
year I believe) on a more-or-less Slackware 7.0 system. Unfortunately, I
don't have a pre-1.2 JDK lying around anywhere to experiment with
anymore. I do recall having some trouble with IBM's JDK on a SuSE 6.4
system back around June (I don't remember whether it was 1.1.8 or 1.1.7)
- not related to this problem, but several things didn't work right and
I had about 10 minutes to decide whether to scrap that project - no time
to research it; that was the last pre-1.2 system I've fiddled with.

	It's puzzling that this would work under Gnome/E - I believe Dan has
demonstrated that it's really not a WM issue (absent any key bindings in
your .fvwm2rc).

	Paul, do you use the other Gnome stuff when you run FVWM - is the only
difference the choice of window manager to start up? Or is there a bunch
of other Gnome startup stuff that isn't getting run with FVWM? And can
you verify which LookAndFeel is being used? And what flavor of OS are
you using?

	I seem to recall that you can set the default LAF (normally Metal) in
Java's config file, but I may be dreaming. Brad...are you out there?
Does that ring a bell with you? (Yes, I'm grasping at straws.)


Cheers,
Bob

Yes I'm lurking about.  Somewhere either in your main if its a program
or in the init of the Applet do the following to change L&F

      try { 
        //UIManager.setLookAndFeel(
        //          UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
        // If you want the Cross Platform L&F instead, comment out
        //the above line and uncomment the following:
        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(
                  UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName()); 
      } catch (UnsupportedLookAndFeelException exc) {
        System.err.println("Warning: UnsupportedLookAndFeel: " + laf);
      } catch (Exception exc) { 
        System.err.println("Error loading " + laf + ": " + exc);
      }


After a brief walk through the java source I think I see the problem if
you run the attached code and type into the frame that comes up you will
see the key events printed out on stderr.  If you try something like alt
+ F.  You will notice the modifiers element is something like Meta+Alt

My guess is that the code that actually processes the events is looking
at a different KeyStroke object than you passed in.  So the real
question is what is E passing that fvwm isn't if it works under one and
not the other.

So if you wouldn't mind try this code out under both and examine the 
results.

You can with the ResizeOpaque style as Dan already mentioned.
You will need a current beta version, though.  But you may not
like the result for your applications.  Many programs are unable
to handle opaque resizing properly and flicker a lot or keep
redrawing for many sencond after you finished the operation.

Brad,

You will see Alt+Meta modifiers for Alt-? events
unless you run xmodmap to redifine what these keys do.
 Under X Windows these keys are mapped to the same key
code.  Therefore when you hit the Alt key Linux thinks
you're hitting the Alt and Meta keys.

To avoid this, run xmodmap like this:

xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Alt_L" -e keysym Alt_R =
Alt_R"

Interestingly, this problem has solved itself.  For
unrelated reasons I switch from compiling FVWM myself
to just using the FVWM RPM off of the RedHat CD.  Now
the Alt-? keys work just fine.  Go figure!

Thanks for all of your help!
Paul

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

If the icon label is wider than the icon, FVWM truncates it whenever
the icon does not have the focus.  This is fine, but I'd like to
have it show the rightmost characters of the title instead of the
leftmost.  (Alternatively, it could make the title two lines high
and wrap the text.)  Is something of the sort possible?  I couldn't
find anything in the manpage or FAQ.

I don't want to just use a shorter icon title, since I want to be
able to see the full title by moving the mouse over the icon.

Howdy!,

I am a very newbie of fvwm (less than an hour) after being tired of noises
of swapping HD with KDE and last version of WindowMaker, even though I
have 128MB of RAM. 

My  question:
I am running Mandrake 7.01 at home and trying to figure out how to get
Turkish fonts on kvt and wordperfect with fvwm (iso-8859-9) as I do in
KDE. 

Details:
I am able to use turkish fonts with KDE, now in fvwm
I can see kvt menus in Turkish in options kvt shows I am using iso-8859-9
fonts (because it was all set in KDE that way IMHO) *but*
there is no .fvwmrc file in /root directory, and I can not see some
Turkish characters, all I can find is
/etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc  file but I don't think this is the my desktop
settings file because it includes bunch of stuff including netscape and I
see no netscape, so I can be happy running an xterm and opening all
applications from that window but I have to get Turkish fonts first, then
I can learn more about fvwm and pop-up windows. (A darker desktop
background would be nicer too :)  )

Regards to all.

Hello again,

I found the configuration file which is /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc ,
now how do I configure myself with a file on /root/directory? Is it
possible?

And I read in that file as:
# make sure these fonts exist on your system:
WindowFont -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
IconFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-* 

Are those the fonts which works on apps as kvt and wordperfect? If so how
do I add Turkish fonts in it?

Thanks in advance.

The difference here is between what Sun has implemented and Linux
does.  Sun keyboars have seperate keys for Alt and Meta.  Linux 
lumps them together, probablly to help out the emacs users. 
So you are right under Linux you either give an accelerator of Alt+Meta
or use xmodmap, ideally you want both, but I don't beleive the stock Menu 
code handles multiple modifiers so you woul have ot extend.

If you create a file named $HOME/.fvwm2rc, fvwm will read it
before the system.fvwm2rc file.  That may vary depending on how
Mandrake starts fvwm, but its worth a try.

The  WindowFont is  used in  the  titlebar of  your   windows, and the
IconFont is used   in the  label  under  the  icons.  This should   be
explained in the fvwm man page.  Try "man fvwm2".

I think you should be able to substitute Turkish fonts.

The fonts that kvt and wordperfect use are controlled separately.
I don't know how either of those programs work.

I'm not  sure whats controlling your background,  there is an optional
fvwm module for  that, (FvwmBacker), you might want to check and see
if its running.

Hi,
Lately I have been having problems with the latest snapshots of FVWM and XMMS.
XMMS starts fine and everything, but when I try to move it, it moves very
slowly. Moving XMMS works just fine under other window managers. Does anyone
know what is happening and/or how to fix it?
Also of interest, when I restart FVWM, XMMS is dies.

Hi FVWM'ers!!

I was wondering if there was a way to tell fvwm not to Quit when
there are other applications running. Just to prevent some unsaved
data to be lost, etc.

TIA

Nicola

You can use this instead of Quit:

  None ("*") Quit

Hi all,

I'm new to FVWM, although I've used quite a few other WMs before. I'm trying
out 2.3.21 inside a gnome-session, although the question is appliccable in
more general settings.

I've got a panel running (26 pixels high at the top of the screen) and would
like to mark this off as an "out-of-bounds" region for other windows - ie if I
maximise a window it won't take up the top 26 pixels of the screen. Similarly,
new windows won't appear in the top 26 pixels (I can live with putting default
co-ords at 0 26 for this). There's definitely a way of stopping maximisation
to the bottom 26 pixels, but I'm awkward and have my panel at the top... Any
ideas?

Thanks for all help,

-Dave

If you have fvwm 2.3.21 or greater, you might want to try 

 Maximize 100 grow

The 'grow' argument grows the window until it hits another window (in 
this case probably the panel).

I just like grow on general principles.  It's been pretty useful to me.

You would be better with bottom panels. Still let's try.

If you use (Style * SmartPalcement, CleverPlacement) fvwm will try its
best not to put new windows over existing windows, especially sticky ones.

If you use iconified windows (Style "xterm" Icon xterm.xpm), you can
specify a place for your icons using (Style * IconBox).

To maximize propertly you can try this MyMaximize instead of Maximize:

DestroyFunc MyMaximize
AddToFunc   MyMaximize
+ I Maximize 100 -26p
+ I Current (Maximized) Move w w+26p

It flicks a bit, but works well.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think if you move the panel to a higher layer, FVWM will also not
obscure it.

In my Gnome desktop, the panel came out at layer 2 by default.  It also
wouldn't auto-raise over the other windows, which made it effectively
invisible unless I moved windows around (maybe because it's on a
different layer?  I'm not sure exactly how layers play with FvwmAuto?).

I used ``Style "panel" Layer 6'' to move it up, now it's fine.

Dave didn't want other windows to be under the panel, he wanted them to be
outside of the panel space completely.

Raise and Lower (these are used in FvwmAuto) work only inside one layer.

Yes, fine, but only until you collapse it, then it moves itself into layer
2 or 8 again. Very bad behaviour. But there are workarounds though.

Don't know if it's coincidence or on purpose, but ever since I moved the
panel to layer 6 no window has been created that overlaps it, either
over it _or_ underneath it.

Hmm... I don't collapse it ever, but you're right, that sounds bad.

Is it the panel itself that keeps forcing the layer like that?  Is there
any way to customize the layer used from the panel's perspective?

I would think, this is because of CleverPlacement, not because of layer.

Panel uses gnome hints to convince fvwm to change its layer dynamically.
So this should be configured in the panel.

Thanks to Dominik, now it is possible to do: Style panel GNOMEIgnoreHints
This sounds a bit silly (disable gnome hints from gnome panel), but
this is a good answer to the panel developers forcing this behaviour. :)

There are other solutions with layers depending on whether you want panel
to be always on the same layer as other windows or always above or below.

Mikhael.

I dunno what to tell you, except that when the panel was at layer 2, my
Netscape windows would constantly be created obscuring it (I'm a huge
fan of mouse-2 in Netscape :).  Since FvwmAuto didn't do much (as you've

while muttering under my breath.

Once I got off my butt and used FvwmCommand to change the Layer to 6

Hello, FVWM lovers.
We are pleased to announce FVWM Themes version 0.4.0.
All info about FVWM Themes and sources are available at the Home Page:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

FVWM Themes is a powerful configurational framework for the latest FVWM,
designed to be easily extendible and configurable.

fvwm-themes 0.4.0 requires fvwm 2.3.22, released these days (not earlier),
so you should first upgrade your fvwm before trying fvwm-themes.

There are rpm packages for both fvwm 2.3.22 and fvwm-themes 0.4.0 at:

  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/rpm/

Currently both fvwm and fvwm-themes are beta software, but should be
stable enough. We invite you to test both.

New features in fvwm-themes 0.4.0 as compared to fvwm-themes 0.2.6:

  * configuring using autoconf/automake
  * several new themes
  * improvements in all (12) themes
  * several kinds of configuration GUI's
  * separation of user and site themes
  * complete rewrite of the theme engine
  * plenty of documentation
  * partial internationalization, supported french and russian
  * sessions, variants, options, locks, drops and many more new things

Note: currently the entire configuration is reloaded on every single
component switch. This will be improved in the next major version 1.0.0.

The FVWM Themes developers, 12 November 2000

The CleverPlacement algorithm uses various penalties when placing
windows.  Placing windows under a window in a higher layer uses an
avoidance factor 5 times higher compared to normal windows.  This
is the reason why windows are rarely placed unden "OnTop" windows
with CleverPlacement.  However, if you create enough windows on a
high layer, normal windows *will* be placed beneath them.

I didn't want to hear "why does the gnome panel obscure all my windows"
after 2.4 over and over again.  How about

  style *gnome* GNOMEIgnoreHints

as default? :-)=)

I pinned down this problem in the xmms sources and sent a patch to the
developers.  Here it goes:

----------------------------- snip -----------------------------
--- main.c.orig Sun Nov 12 14:20:01 2000
+++ main.c      Sun Nov 12 14:33:23 2000

        gdk_flush();
+       /* give the X server a chance to handle our requests */
+       xmms_usleep(1);

 }

----------------------------- snip -----------------------------

Apply this patch to the file xmms/main.c in the xmms sources.

Bye

:-O :)

Unfortunately, I don't think this will solve this problem because, IIRC,
the panel (at least) won't match "gnome".  I know the class is just
"Panel" and the instance is "panel".  I can't remember the rest; I'll
have to check tomorrow (I don't run Gnome on my home system).

I tried that patch and it didn't seem to help much so I raised the delay to
500. I think this might have improved the situation, but it isn't an obvious
improvement. I have a dual PIII system so I don't think that the speed of my
computer is causing the problem.

Hello, FVWM lovers.
We are pleased to announce FVWM Themes version 0.4.0.
All info about FVWM Themes and sources are available at the Home Page:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

FVWM Themes is a powerful configurational framework for the latest FVWM,
designed to be easily extendible and configurable.

fvwm-themes 0.4.0 requires fvwm 2.3.22, released these days (not earlier),
so you should first upgrade your fvwm before trying fvwm-themes.

There are rpm packages for both fvwm 2.3.22 and fvwm-themes 0.4.0 at:

  ftp://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/pub/fvwm-themes/rpm/

Currently both fvwm and fvwm-themes are beta software, but should be
stable enough. We invite you to test both.

New features in fvwm-themes 0.4.0 as compared to fvwm-themes 0.2.6:

  * configuring using autoconf/automake
  * several new themes
  * improvements in all (12) themes
  * several kinds of configuration GUI's
  * separation of user and site themes
  * complete rewrite of the theme engine
  * plenty of documentation
  * partial internationalization, supported french and russian
  * sessions, variants, options, locks, drops and many more new things

Note: currently the entire configuration is reloaded on every single
component switch. This will be improved in the next major version 1.0.0.

The FVWM Themes developers, 12 November 2000

Hi,

I am a long time fvwm user, and recently I also tried out enlightenment.
Enlightenment cannot really satisfy my key binding need, so I am going
back to fvwm.

But I found that, enlightenment with a really light theme(the defaul for
sawfish) only uses 1.5-2.0MB on my system. This includes both the pager
running transparently and the icon box as well.

I remembered when I was running fvwm, fvwm, fvwm-buttons, fvwm-pager
altogether is well over 2MB. So am I wrong or misunderstanding the
definition of "light weight"?

BTW, I thought sawfish is "light weight" too, after trying out, the
sawfish process plus the list interpreter all add up to 4.5MB. How is
that light weight?

Please clarify with my understanding...

Thanks.

Shao.

Each window manager attempts to balance memory usage, cpu consumption,
visual appearance, and features.

Pick the one that provides the balance you want.

There are sources in .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 (smaller).
The first lines of the announcement are:

All info about FVWM Themes and sources are available at the Home Page:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

> http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/ doesn't have them (yet?)...

This is obsolete address, it is now changed to http://fvwm.org/ .
FVWM Themes is not required to run FVWM, there are links to this add-on.

Hi,

Looks very nice. But is there any plan to include a microGUI theme from
amiga? I think that is a really nice/simple theme.

You also have to account for shared memory (or rather, count that kind
of memory less), as well as the lightness of your fvwm config.  Using 
a lot of pixmaps isn't going to help, for example.

I'm running fvwm2 (2.3.21), and here's the memory usage from top (look

Even if you don't account for shared memory being, well, *shared*, 
fvwm2 + pager + buttons adds up to a whopping total of 2108 kilobytes 
of memory.  If you don't want Buttons (Enlightenment does not provide 
a Buttons, after all), you can thrive on less.  The extra bells and 
whistles for the iconmanager (which is *the* best icon manager I've 
ever seen, across several variants of TWM and a bunch of other window 
managers) and the event modules bring the total up to 2672 kB.

Notice I'm running extra bells and whistles, and it's still particularly 
light.  My setup is sparse and simple -- no icons except for mini icons 
in the pager and those in the Buttons, simple gradients on window titles 
and menus.   Have got a ton of key bindings though (I really hate mice).

Sawfish is lightweight for a window manager that is extremely, extremely 
flexible (how more flexible can you get *without* an interpreter of some 
sort running around, after all?).

If you really want lightweight, go check out wm2 and wmx.  Both will 
give you key bindings (changeable only at compile time, and only a 
limited set), and will be particularly fast and very, very light.  Heck, 
there's also aewm, pwm, and larswm to consider, in the lightweight yet 
focusing on one particular feature (pwm puts multiple windows into one 
window frame.  larswm automatically tiles) category.

Dan said it best.  :-)  (For me, fvwm offers the best compromise between 
memory/cpu usage, visual clarity, and flexibility.  I've gone through over 
ten or so different window managers.  AfterStep, BlackBox, olwm, twm, ctwm, 
vtwm included... been there, done that, got the config files.)

At this stage we are mostly work on features of the framework (to be able
to create even more flexible themes). Creating new themes themselves has a
low priority for now. If you or anyone else is able to create look or feel
of this or other theme in FVWM, we will be glad to clean up and include it.
You may submit your work to fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

This seems like it ought to be an FAQ, but I haven't been able to
find the answer.  Is there a simple method of causing the FvwmConsole
window to have a title bar so it can be iconified?

Hi,

I am trying to install fvwm 2.3.22 on my machine and keep getting the xpm 
version error. I am currently using 2.2.4 and I had installed xpm 3.4k 
previously. Since the requirement for 2.3.22 is that xpm shud be > 3.4g, i 
don't understand what I am missing??

Please help... TIA...

Take a look at config.log file, it may contain some info for you.
Just a guess, do you have 2 versions of xpm installed on your system?

Try to specify --with-xpm-library and --with-xpm-includes as suggested
by 'configure --help' and INSTALL.fvwm file. There is also FAQ entry.

Mikhael.

You'll want to see FAQ entry 3.1, on configuring FVWM on RH systems.
But what you're looking to disable is probably a line in the config
like:

Style   "Fvwm*" NoTitle

Or, an additional line like:

Style   "FvwmConsole"   Title

after the notitle line.

Increasing the delay will not help.  The idea is to free the smallest
possible amount of CPU so that the scheduler taker care of letting
other tasks run.  Perhaps your xmms runs with a higher priority than
your X server?  Try starting (the patched version of) xmms with

  $ nice -20 xmms

(this does not help on my system, though).

Hello,

I used to have fvwm 2.3.20 on my system. One day I decided to make some
room so that I could install Cygwin and since I had no free hard disk
left I decided to make a big tarball of /usr/local which contained
fvwm 2.3.20 among other things and reformat my /usr/local as a FAT32
partition so that it could be shared between Linux and Win2K which
could now install Cygwin there. Once that was done I reunpacked my
tarball to the /usr/local partition now built on top of FAT32. Things
ran pretty smoothly and fvwm 2.3.20 continued to run except for my
symbolic links were now broken. Then fvwm 2.3.22 was released recently
and I decided to give it a try but the make install stuff produced the
following errors as it was not possible to create the symbolic links.

ln -s FvwmEvent /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.22/FvwmAudio
ln: cannot create symbolic link `/usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.22/FvwmAudio'
to `FvwmEvent': Operation not permitted
make[3]: *** [install-exec-local] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/tmp/fvwm-2.3.22/modules/FvwmEvent'
make[2]: *** [install-am] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/fvwm-2.3.22/modules/FvwmEvent'
make[1]: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/fvwm-2.3.22/modules'
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1

I suggest that either the ./configure script be modified to allow an
option called --no-symlinks which would cause the make install
section of the Makefile to do all the useual stuff except for
symlinks. Alternatively the make install portion of the Makefile
could check the filesystem to see if symlinks are supported but
I don't know whether there's an easy way to do this other than
reading /etc/fstab which of course is not optimal.

By the way, as it stands I can run fvwm2 but some things such
as the FvwmPager do not work as make install never got to the
part of the Makefile which installed it (only some modules were
installed in /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.3.22 so probably even
ensuring that all symlinks are created only at the very end of
the make install stage might result in a fix provided that there
is nothing else that needs to be done after that).

Thanks,

Neil

Use "make -k" to keep going after an error.

Thanks to all for replying to my question.... I have solved the problem... 
our system has 2 installations of the X software...  it must be a lib 
version issue.... does FVWM have a requirement as to which version of the X 
is required... if so, it might be a good idea to warn the user...

Neil: Sorry for the dumb question, but what does ldconfig exactly do? I 
didn't find it anywhere on my system... all i did was download the xpm s/w 
from the website and untarred it...

Thanks to all once again...

nitin

Fvwm doesn't require a particular version of X.
My guess is that your 2 copies of X were causing a compile or run error
during the configure step.

Thanks for letting us know everythings OK now.

Go to modules/FvwmEvent/Makefile and remove or comment one of the last
lines starting with $(LN_S), then rerun 'make install'.
The next version will try cp here if ln is failed.

Thinking about this more, you can do this already now yourself, just run
'make LN_S=cp install' or make LN_S=true install'.

Hi all,

My fvwm session starts out great... but a few problems when I Restart the 
session (not logout)

1. My TaskBar moves from the bottom of the screen to the top (I can't move 
it)

2. The xpm images on the Popup Menu, don't show up anymore... instead it 
looks more like "Xterm %xterm.xpm%" and so on...

3. Similar issue with my FvwmButtons... no images are shown and the size of 
the Buttons shrink...

If there are any issues with moving from 2.2.4 to 2.3.22 that i need to 
know... please point it out to me...

TIA...

nitin

Maybe when you restart it's using the "old" FVWM again?  Did you install
this version somewhere different than the old version or install it with
a different name (like fvwm2-2.3.22) so that when you run "type fvwm2"
or "which fvwm2" it finds the old one instead of the new one?

You can give an explicit command to be run during Restart, now, if you
like.

On the same token... why doesn't

Style "FvwmTalk" Title

work?? Is there anyway of getting a title bar on it?

You've got all these people on your CC list, I don't know if you want
to cc them or not...

To figure out second parameter, use FvwmIdent.  Use either the
Class, Resource, or name.

In this case use either

"FormFvwmTalk*" or "FvwmForm" (for all forms).

Hi,

Is it possible to make the FvwmPager transparent with the background? Or
use an xpm for the BackColor instead...

Thanks.

Shao.

Hello all,

If those guys were so good, they would even help me out localizing
(in Turkish) my lovely fvwm 2.2.2 too. ;->

(I am scared to upgrade fvwm because 2.2.2 is the best on less memory
using, when I upgraded my windowmaker a month ago it turned out to be a
memory gobbler worse than KDE1).

Regards.

You didn't say what exactly you want to translate. I don't think that
people which do not know Turkish, can help you with an actual translation.

If the problem is that you can't see Turkish, you should redifine fonts
used in window titles, menus, modules. Searching man pages for word 'font'
should help. For fonts used inside applications (something that fvwm can't
control), say fonts used in xterm, refer to the application man pages.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, it is possible using both these methods, but only in the 2.3 series.

The first method uses colorsets. This is a tricky method, you should learn
FvwmTheme man page (including "Transparent" option) to do this.

For the second method, 'man FvwmPager', search for *Pixmap options.

Mikhael.

Greetings All,

I'm a keyboard fanatic, and am wondering whether it
would be possible to define little fvwm functions
which would allow for dynamically binding a key to a
sequence of fvwm commands during an fvwm session.

The emacs template I have in mind goes like this: you
type "C-x (" to declare the beginning of a macro
definition, then you proceed along your merry way as
you would normally, and finally you declare end of
macro with "C-x )".  I'm curious whether you could do
a similar thing in fvwm.  Press F4 or something, fire
up a whole bunch of keyboard (or mouse) events, (some
of which it may pass to application programs, some of
which it handles itself), then end the sequence with
F5, and finally name the sequence Nonsense and bind F6
 to Nonsense for the remainder of the session. Of
course it would be up to the user to make sure that
the definition is sensible to repeat, but still, is it
possible?

Which brings up a related question: can you have
prefix keys in key bindings?

Hi,

Thanks. This is really great news. I will just wait for a 2.4 release...
Could you also let me whether 2.4 will include the FvwmTheme module?

Thanks in advance.

Shao.

Fvwm (and any other window manager) never sees keystrokes
sent to applications.

For keyboard macro recording, you'd need something operating
at the X server level.

Currently there is no way to tell Fvwm to start recording
Fvwm keyboard events.  Since it doesn't see all events,  I'm
not sure such a feature would be useful.

> Which brings up a related question: can you have
> prefix keys in key bindings?

I think you are referring to repeat factors?

Fvwm binds actions to single keyboard events.

Certainly.  It was developed for 2.4.

Note that the FvwmTheme module is not the same as the fvwm-themes

fvwm-themes package is not included in the FVWM distribution.

Thanks for lettting me know. I originally thought they were the same
thing. So what is really fvwm-themes? How is it different from the
FvwmTheme module?

The FvwmTheme module is a module that provides functionality that theme
engines want to use, like creating and controlling colorsets, etc.

fvwm-themes is a framework for writing themes, that tries to make it
easy to integrate new themes, provides a way to choose between them,
etc.  It helps manage the various restart/destroy/create operations
needed to invoke a new theme.  It also contains a number of actual
themes you can use or start with to write your own.  It uses the
FvwmTheme module quite a bit during its operation, but it's not a part
of FVWM proper.

Hi,

I upgraded from fvwm 2.3.19 to 2.3.22 on Solaris 2.6.

What happens is that in my .fvwm2rc in the InitFunction I call
a shell scripts that open a few clients at startup.
Now if some of those clients are started as iconic, fvwm hangs
(or "freeze" if you prefer) for some time at startup.

In my .fvwm2rc, I have also

Style "*" NoIcon


This was working OK in 2.3.19.

Any suggestion?

Many thanks in advance,

Hi all,

I have set the ColormapFocus as FollowsFocus and I have focus as 
ClicktoFocus. I am using Solaris 2.6.

Whenever I use netscape, the colormap seems to get "stuck" occasionally... 
but after a while restores itself to the appropriate colormap.

Has anyone else experienced similar problems?? Is this a known issue/bug?

TIA...

nitin

Thanks for the in depth explanation. May I think that fvwm-themes are a
collection of exampes/framework using FvwmTheme and other FvwmModules to
make themes for FVWM?

Also, how come there is no FVWM section on themes.org? Any political
issues involved?

Shao.

Simple question, but it's baffling me.

I'm using fvwm-themes 0.4 with fvwm 2.3.22 and have extended the osx theme a
little to suit my own tastes. I'd like to use MwmDecor with the maximise and
sticky buttons, and these work fine except I can't get the Toggled style to be
flat. Normal buttons come up flat without any problem, but when toggled, the
buttons always come out raised. I can't seem to find any references to them
outside of the theme directory, and even tried using FvwmCommand to set things
on the fly, but no luck. Typical example in the theme rc:

AddButtonStyle All -- flat
[.......]
ButtonStyle 2 - Clear MWMDecorMax
AddButtonStyle 2 Pixmap button/ball-green.xpm
AddButtonStyle 2 ToggledActiveUp (Pixmap button/ball-green-filled.xpm)
AddButtonStyle 2 ToggledActiveDown (Pixmap button/ball-green-filled.xpm)
AddButtonStyle 2 ToggledInactive (Pixmap button/ball-green-filled.xpm)

Any idea how I can get it working? Even a fix via FvwmCommand would be useful,
so that I could make sure I can do the thing to start with. Or whether I could
obtain info on what's already been set via ButtonStyle?

Thanks for any help,

-Dave

Yes, I had a feeling that I was off in the clouds

of it.

I have finally discovered the root of a problem I am having with
fvwm2(2.2.4).  When my caps lock key is on, ClickToFocus does not work - the
M1 does nothing.  Likewise with other modifiers.  I tried defining M 1 to
focus but then all M 1 events are grabbed.  What else am I missing?  Thanks
for your help.

I kludged together a (nonmaximized) Resize grow...

AddToFunc "Max2Size"
+	"I" Maximize
+	"I" ResizeMove $0p $1p $2p $3p
+	"I" Resize br w-10p w-27p	# correction

AddToFunc "Fit_Y"
+	"I" Resize keep 1p	# start from smallest size
+	"I" Maximize 0 grow
+	"I" Max2Size $[w.width] $[w.height] $[w.x] $[w.y]


questions:
Is there a less kludgy way?
Why is the final size too big that i need to make a correction?
Can i combine the Resize correction into the ResizeMove?
ResizeMove $0p $1p-27p $2p $3p doesnt work.

Thanx

The FAQ! :)

  http://www.fvwm.org/generated/FAQ.html

See question 5.5.


Personally, I just rebind CAPS LOCK to be another CTRL key.  Who the
heck needs a CAPS LOCK key anyway?  If you think you need to use it, you
should almost always think again :).

I don't know who to send this mail out to, but wouldn't it be a nice to have 
the fvwm2rc file along with the screenshots on the webpage... this was we 
don't have to send a mail everytime we need to copy a feature... we could 
just read and learn... or are they some privacy issues... or may be a 
copyright just a issue... hehehehe...

  you might want to look into testing (QC) tools that enable you to
record X events, I do nopt have experience with such tools in unix, I
know such tools exist, not sure if there are any free ones.

This kind of suggestion should go the fvwm-workers list, but its not
completely off topic here.

I think most users .fvwm2rc's are way too big to post, and no one
would want them anyway.  I know mine is.  Besides that, mine is in about
15 pieces.

Notice that on the Vector buttons page, the config files ARE included.
I think that targetted approach is the way to go.  Ie., what config file
lines to you need to get a certain appearance.

We could have FvwmPager configs, FvwmButton configs, Border configs,
Menu configs, you get the idea.

There shouldn't be anything copyrighted on the screenshots page.
Thats come up a few times, (in the context of the background images)
and when there was doubt, we've changed it.

If you have anything you think should be on the web site, submit it
to the fvwm-workers list.

I wrote a small application using FVWM and now am being asked about capturing
screen shots of it. Would someone please point me in the right direction? I'm
basically interested in how it's done and what the final file format would be.

Thanks,
Dave

Try "gimp" -> Xtns -> Screen shot

Press grab and point towards your application. Press left button.

In the window that opens right click -> file -> save as

That should do it. You can select the desired file format
in the save dialog .

The problem here is that it is the windowlook component that decides
if the buttons are flat or not (technical reasons). So, which windowlook
do you use? (it seems to me that windowlook@osx gives flat buttons).
You can enforce flat buttons by adding  AddButtonStyle All -- flat in
the file .fvwm/themes/personal/extra-windowlook (and refresh and then
select this component, see the FVWM themes FAQ and doc/* for more
details). If you a creating a complete themes use the windowlook 
component. I Hope I am not wrong ...

I do not know where is the good place for questions and answers about
fvwm-themes. May be fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.net is a better
place (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fvwm-themes/ or
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/ to subscribe). Or we have to create
fvwm-themes@lists.sourceforge.net, or maybe fvwm@hpc.uh.edu is the good

In the past using Redhat Linux systems up to 6.2 I've been able to
configure fvwm2 to my liking using Redhats setup with AnotherLevel
which is not the stock way to set up fvwm2.

Now running Freebsd and I'm trying to use the normal way of
configuring.  That is with an .fvwm2rc in $HOME/.fvwm/

fvwm2 -version    reveals:

  fvwm2 -version
  [FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.3.20 compiled on Jul  9 2000 at 13:37:33
  [FVWM][main]:  with support for:  ReadLine XPM IMLIB Session
  

One thing I haven't been able to get the way I want it is how focus is
handled.

I want FocusFollowsMouse where when the cursor enters/leaves a frame
that frame  gains/looses focus.  But further I want any frame the
cursor enters to be raised within a settable period of time.

I haven't been able to figure out how to get those interrelated items
to work together.

Or the syntax I need to set this in .fvwm2rc

So in summary I'm asking how to set things up so that:

Mouse Cursor enters window - window gets focus and is raised within <N ms>
Mouse Cursor leaves window - window looses focus.

No sloppy focus or other watered down version of FocusFollowsMouse.

In view of the mass of config files, vast number of Variables etc.
I'm findiing it difficult to get my preferred setup.

I think whats confusing you is that the 2 issues are not that closely
related.

Try "man FvwmAuto".

Good for you. FreeBSD rocks. Sorry, couldn't resist the call to

Subject: FVWM: Secrets of FvwmCommand ?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I want to discover the "resource" and "class" of several windows,
in hopes that those from a particular application (which do not
share a common window or icon name) will have _something_ in common
that I can use to identify them.

It appears that the send_windowlist operation of FvwmCommand will tell
me what I need to know.  However, I can't get FvwmCommand to work.

In FvwmConsole I typed "FvwmCommandS" and it created the FIFOs:

$ ls -l .FvwmCommand*
crw-------    1 phutchis phutchis 255, 255 Nov 16 19:03 .FvwmCommandC
crw-------    1 phutchis phutchis 255, 255 Nov 16 19:03 .FvwmCommandM

but FvwmCommand can't find them:

$ FvwmCommand -f .FvwmCommand send_windowlist
No such device FvwmCommand error in opening message fifo

The same thing happens with or without -f and/or -r.

The only clue I can find is that, when I type FvwmCommandS in
FvwmConsole, this gets appended to .xsession-errors:

    FvwmCommandS server error in opening command fifo, No such device

which doesn't make a lot of sense given that, as noted above, it
did in fact create the FIFOs.  What am I doing wrong?

Thanks, that does take care of the immediate problem.  Still
interested in why FvwmCommand won't work, though.  Is anyone
using it successfully on Red Hat Linux?

Those don't look like FIFO's to me.  On all my "normal" UNIX systems,
including RH6.2, FIFO's are listed with a `p' in the first column.
Those look like character devices (note the `c' and the major and
minor numbers).  I have no idea why you're seeing this.
FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS work just fine for me on RH6.2.  Fvwm 2.2.4

Is the location of your pipes by any chance on NFS.  Pipes don't work
on NFS.  If you do FvwmCommandS /tmp/FvwmCommand
then use FvwmCommand /tmp/FvwmCommand

AHA!  That's it.

Suggestion for a future update:  FvwmCommandS and FvwmCommand
might check whether the home directory is NFS-mounted, and if
so use something like /tmp/$DISPLAY/.FvwmCommand as the default
FIFO set.  (I try to avoid global places like /tmp/FvwmCommand,
in case there might be another FVWM running on the same system,
e.g. for an Xterminal.)

In the meantime, it might be worth adding this tidbit to the
FvwmCommand manpage or the FAQ.

Hello,

Thanks to all developers for the current state of fvwm2. I was quite
impressed with the latest beta release 2.3.22 of fvwm2. It seems to
me that everything is now running significantly faster and smoother
than ever on my P166 probably due to the latest bugfixes including
memory leaks and the like. Thanks!

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

I have a question regarding PipeRead. I am trying to use it to read
the output of a script and use it as a text string to be passed to
FvwmForm as follows:

*LogoutVerifyText        PipeRead "/home/nzanella/logout.sh"

My script is well tested and works fine and the rest of the
Module FvwmForm LogoutVerify is also OK. The ~/.xsession-error
file does not complain but when I open the form with a mouse
click the text output of PipeRead is just not on the form.
Did I do something wrong?

Thanks,

Neil

I don't think there is a better way. Your method is quite interesting.
You can start from Resize keep 0.

> Why is the final size too big that i need to make a correction?

Because $[w.*] size variables include borders, while Resize operates with
sizes of the application without borders, so since your border is 5 pixels
and your title width is 17, here goes the correction.

Probably we can later add variables returning size without borders/title.

> Can i combine the Resize correction into the ResizeMove?
> ResizeMove $0p $1p-27p $2p $3p doesnt work.

No, you can't, only one 'p' is allowed in an argument.
As I said, a better fix would be to introduce additional variables.

Mikhael.

PipeRead is the fvwm command, FvwmForm or other module do not know about
it, so you can't use it in the middle of the line. Instead, you can use:

  PipeRead `printf '*LogoutVerifyText '; /home/nzanella/logout.sh`

If you have many similar lines, you could probably like to write a shell
script generating the form (all *LogoutVerify lines) and PipeRead it once.

Mikhael.

Hi folks,

I thank you for all your help to using Turkish fonts, fonts are ok, but
I have to run kikbd to use Turkish keyboard from the shell, would you
tell me where do I need to place kikbd command in my
/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc file. (Its 16K long and I can send it if
someone wishes to check).

Thanks in advance.

You might want to look at FvwmKb or Xkb for doing keymap control in
fvwm. FvwmKb is found at http://members.linuxstart.com/~sparrow/ and I
don't have anything regarding Xkb.

I don't understand what kikbd does. Someone else here with experience
in i18n might be able to help you better, but in case no one pipes up,
is kikbd X-aware or is it specific to a particular shell instance? It
might be better to do something like:

if [ $DISPLAY ]; then
    kikbd
fi

or something like that, in your .login. If it's meant to be started at
the beginning of your X session, add it to your fvwm InitFunction (see
the manpage on InitFunction and on AddToFunc). Basically, you just
need to:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" I Exec kikbd

Maybe this is helpful.

Making the pager transparent using colour sets really does not
work well since X does not update the transparent part after
something was drawn there and erased. I recommend using a pixmap
background.

In the 2.3.x betas the pipes are created in /var/tmp or in /tmp
and their name is always unique, even if there are multiple
instances of fvwm2 running.

You and Dan Aspen are absolutely right - I now use rxvt instead of
xterm, Midnight
Commander instead of xvf. I still use fvwm95.
Thanks to you both.

Is there a way to create a new decor which starts out as a copy of

is it possible to change the definitions which comprise the default
decor (without recompiling FVWM)?

You can emulate this using the following InitializeDecor function.

  DestroyFunc InitializeDecor
  AddToFunc   InitializeDecor
  + I DestroyDecor $0
  + I AddToDecor   $0
  + I + ButtonStyle ...
  + I + TitleStyle ...
  + I + BorderStyle ...
  + I + ...

  InitializeDecor MyNewDecor1
  AddToDecor MyNewDecor1
  + ...

  InitializeDecor MyNewDecor2
  AddToDecor MyNewDecor2
  + ...

Hello,

Is there a way to temporarily disable/reenable all key bindings in this
new release of Fvwm. This would be desirable for testing appliccations
or when working with new applications which may for some reason or another
need to intercept some seldomly used key binding.

Thanks,

Neil

No, but you could write functions that bind and unbind the keys
you are concerned about.

Perhaps I can use PipeRead to generate all possibille keystrokes which
fvwm knows about and unbind each single one of them. Where can I find
such a list and how can I unbind a key?

Thanks,

Subject: FVWM: problems binding keys during fvwm session  
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi,

I'm having problems doing something which I think should be very
simple: dynamically loading new fvwm keybindings with FvwmCommand
during an fvwm session.  This only seems to work if the key was
already explicitly bound to something at startup with the .fvwm2rc
init file.  


For example, say I have the command "Key BackSpace A C
Nop" but NO command of the form "Key Insert A C SOMECOMMAND".  Then if
I do:

  % FvwmCommand 'Key BackSpace A C Exec exec xterm' 
  % FvwmCommand 'Key Insert A C Exec exec xterm'  

Then pressing C-backspace starts up an xterm, while C-insert does not.


Of course I could get around this by firing up a whole slew of Nop
bindings in the .fvwm2rc file and reserving any dynamic overriding
to those keystrokes.  But the mere inelegance of this solution makes me
a rather displeased man.

(I'm running Red Hat 6.2 with Fvwm 2.2.4.) 

Help?

xmodmap -pk will show all the keys X knows about.
Fvwm doesn't have a command to show you all of its current key bindings.
Modifying Fvwm to do so probably wouldn't be too hard.

You can unbind a key with a dash:

Key F1 A A -

I think you would be much better off just unbinding the one or 2 keys
that are causing you a problem.  Fvwm 2.2.x doesn't bind any keys on
its own, all the key bindings are in your .fvwm2rc.  Since you want to
reenable the keys you are going to have to find all the bindings
anyway.

Since you are worried about keys used by applications, you
want to bind/unbind keys that are active in a window (or all) context.

Here are 2 functions doing what you want; call them when needed from menu:

AddToFunc UnbindAllBoundKeys
+ I PipeRead `grep '^Key ' .fvwm2rc | awk '{ print $1, $2, $3, $4, "-" }'`

AddToFunc RebindAllBoundKeys
+ I PipeRead `grep '^Key ' .fvwm2rc`

FVWM does not distinguishes between commands on startup (in your .fvwm2rc)
or commands coming after that. So it should work regardless whether you
want to bind a new key or rebind an old one.

Just to be sure, do you run FvwmCommandS? FvwmCommand does not work
without FvwmCommandS.

Or maybe your Insert key is not mapped to Insert keysym. Does it work
if you execute this 'Key Insert ..' command in FvwmConsole or FvwmTalk?

Mikhael.

Running:  Redhat linux  6.2 with
 AnotherLevel [fvwm2] window manager
 Fvwm Version 2.2.4

With large  `virtual desktop'
xwininfo shows:
  Width: 1600
  Height: 1280
  Depth: 16

[...]
  -geometry 1600x1280+0+0

---

Not sure if this is the province of the window manager or what, but
would like to `fix' an annoying behavior of long standing.

Certain applications like `control-panel',`tksysv',`netcfg' or others
such as cbb [checkbook app], pop up secondary dialog windows for
different aspects of usage.  With the large virtual desktop these
secondary windows may appear in unexpected places or even out of
sight.

I'd like to make any pop-up windows appear in the near vacinity of the parent
window but have no idea how to control this.

Yes.  Any version before the 2.3.x betas requires that you 'recapture'
the windows before new key bindings will start to work.  Simply issue

  $ FvwmCommand Recature

after executing your commands and everything will work fine.  With
the next release, the Recapture command will become obsolete.
Virtually all changes in the configuration take effect immediately
then.

Yes.  Any version before the 2.3.x betas requires that you 'recapture'
the windows before new key bindings will start to work.  Simply issue

  $ FvwmCommand Recature

after executing your commands and everything will work fine.  With
the next release, the Recapture command will become obsolete.
Virtually all changes in the configuration take effect immediately
then.

Please try to strip down your config file so that it still
shows the problem.  Also I'd need one of your shell scripts
to debug this.

Does this still happen if you run that command directly
from fvwm (during startup)?

I'm running fvwm on xfree86 4.0.1 with two screens. I would like to be
able to have seperate per-screen configurations.
I started with fvwm 2.2 from Debian, and I'm currently using fvwm 2.3 from
CVS, and there appears to be no capability to define seperate
configurations. Can this feature be added in time for 2.4?

The following works with 2.3 (the first method should work with 2.2 too).
In 2.3 you should have your include files in ~/.fvwm or specify full paths.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are at least 2 ways to define different fvwm configurations for
your screens in multi-headed display system.

1) Create .fvwm2rc-[012] files and start fvwm in .xinitrc (or .Xclients):

  fvwm2 -s -d :0.0 -f .fvwm2rc-0 &
  fvwm2 -s -d :0.1 -f .fvwm2rc-1 &
  fvwm2 -s -d :0.2 -f .fvwm2rc-2

If you wish, .fvwm2rc-* files may all include line "Read .fvwm2rc-common".

2) Start fvwm2 as usual without parameters and put into your .fvwm2rc:

  Read .fvwm2rc-$[screen]

This will read a specific configuration for screen N from .fvwm2rc-N file,
where N is 0, 1, 2.. depending on the number of your screens.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will add this to FVWM FAQ soon, since there were at least 3 similar
questions on different fvwm related lists.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

I have the line

Style * GrabFocus

in my fvwm2 configuration file and I am running version 2.3.22.
This works for most windows except for the one launched when I
type vncserver at the command prompt. This application is part
of VNC which is distributed at:

http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html

How come GrabFocus is not working with this application:

FvwmIdent reveals:

Name:       serverDialog
Icon Name:  serverDialog
Resource:   Vncviewer
Windows ID: 0x340000d

etc...

Transient:         Yes
Focus Policy:      Passive
  - Input Field:   True
  - WM_TAKE_FOCUS: XGetWMProtocols failed

I tried the following but it did not work:

Style "Vncviewer" GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent
Style "serverDialog" GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent

What should I do to get the "VNC server password window" to grab the
focus when it appears?

Thanks,

Neil

This is not hard to accomplish with 2.3.x.  Put all the common
lines in your central configuration file (.fvwm2rc) and add this
line at the end:

  Read .fvwm2rc.$[screen]

Then create a file .fvwm2rc.0 for your first screen .1 for the
second screen and so on.  The only thing you have to make sure is
that the files have to be found in the config dir, which usually
is $HOME/.fvwm if you did not modify anything (I believe - at
least it works for me).

Bye

It's a bug in vnc.  It sets the transientfor hint, but then
provides a nonsense window id for the hint (0x2 in my case).  The
logic in fvwm only grabs focus for new transients if their
'transientfor' currently has focus - which is not the case since
the window does not even exist.

The good news: I made a patch so that GrabFocus overrides
GrabFocusTransient in this case, so it should work for now.

Great! I'm only having two problems now here.. I'm using Debian's fvwm2rc
system with the user hooks in it. I have all my module resource setting
and Style settings done in my ~/.fvwm/post.hook
My post.hook is Read'ing post.hook.$[screen], which have per-display
customisations for FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager.

I am loading FvwmIconMan from my init-restart.hook, as the local
documentation indicates I should. FvwmPager is loading from the system
fvwm2rc file.

Problem: My FvwmPagerGeometry setting is halfway-honoured: The size part
is honoured but the placement part isn't, for either screen.

Problem: (old problem even with fvwm 2.2) I gain two instances of
FvwmIconMan per screen, superimposed on each other. My gut feeling is that
there will be 'n' of these, where n is the number of screens attached to
the session.

I've checked, and discovered that even loading FvwmIconMan from
init-restart.hook.0 and not from .1 loads two instances on screen 0. It
appears that FvwmIconMan is too smart for its own good?

Hi,
I am a developer at Goldman Sachs, NY city. Ever since our applications were
migrated for running on the fvwm2 window managers, we find the following
peculiar problem with the time-taken for the hiding of the popup windows:
Our traders use the etManual application for manual outright and swaps
trades. It takes an unusually long time to dismiss all manual trades. There
is a 'dismiss' button on our manual popup which when clicked would free the
resources associated with the current trade and just hide the current manual
popup (only to bring it up to the foreground later with a new trade). This
hiding of the manual popup is not taking place immediately. This looks to
have been around from the time fvwm2 managers were commissioned, but most of
the traders didn't make any fuss about this until one of our traders came up
two weeks back with this issue of the delayed hiding. I looked through the
program code and tested it for the time intervals amidst the time the
'dismiss' button had been clicked to the time the popup is actually hidden.
However, it doesn't show me any clue as regards times, since the hiding
seems to be an asynchronous function. However, I noticed that the window
gets hidden quickly with terminals using pmwm window managers, just the way
the traders want. On the other hand, on my solaris workstation terminal
using fvwm2 window manager I find that it indeed takes considerable time to
have the same popup hidden.

I would be grateful, if you could either point me to a web-page which
discusses why such a thing happens or on how I would need to proceed to
resolve this.

Merci Beaucoup,
Karthik Ramaswamy

No, they're all up and running fine.  I know of no reason on our side that
would explain any problems reaching them.

You will need to provide more information about your environment before
we can help (please reply to the list, not just to me...):

What version of FVWM are you using?  (send the results of "fvwm2 -version")
Any special things about how it was compiled?
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The version being used is 2.2.2. By compilation, are
you hinting at the fvwm2 X-window manager compilation, or the compilation of
my application?

What platform/operating system are you using?
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The uname -a command tells the following:
SunOS nwdvdc026.ny.ficc.gs.com 5.6 Generic_105181-17 sun4u sparc
SUNW,Ultra-5_10.

If you know, what widget set is your application using (Motif, OpenWin,
etc., or maybe it's a Java app?  Tcl/Tk?  Perl/Tk?)
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The widget set used is Motif.

Other different/odd things we should know about?

Try looking at InitFunction in the fvwm manpage.  To wit:

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec exec exmh
+ I Exec exec ical

and so on.

What would be another way of starting up fvwm2?

I'm on an ultra 1 solaris 8 box running fvwm-2.2.4

The way I'm currently doing it is I'm loging in using
the command line login.  Then I execute
/usr/openwin/xinit which then launches a terminal
window in which I type /home/frosbyte/usr/bin/fvwm2 &
and it brings up fvwm2 fine.

The problem is I'm getting too many error msg's.  For
example if I open up dtmail I get the following:

libSDtMail: Warning: Xt Warning: Cannot allocate
colormap entry for "LightGoldenRodYellow"

Or if I open an xterm with colors I get the following
error
 Warning: Cannot allocate colormap entry for "green"

Here's what I've got in my .fvwm2rc file for both
items:

+               "My Mail"       Exec
/usr/dt/bin/ttsession -c /usr/dt/bin/dtmail &

+               "Xgreen"        Exec xterm -fg green
-bg black -sb -sl 9000 -font 8x13 -geometry
=81x35+50+50 -s -rw &


A few months ago I ran into this website that showed
me how to add fvwm2 as one of my windows mgr in my cde
login screen,
(http://twirl.mcc.ac.uk/~zzassgl/wm.html).  I did what
the instructions said to do and I was launching fvwm
fine with no problems or errors.  The problem was that
in order to launch fvwm I had to be on this local
system and I couldn't launch it from another machine. 
So I started running /usr/openwin/bin/xinit then
/home/frosbyte/usr/fvwm2 & but like I said this has
been giving me too many errors.

BTW I don't have an .xinitrc file.  Could this be the
problem?  I really don't know if I'm starting up fvwm2
the right way, if there's a better way please advise. 
Thanks!

Try the following .xinitrc file:

<<Eoxinitrc
#!/bin/sh
exec $HOME/usr/bin/fvwm2
Eoxinitrc

These messages are totally unrelated. The problem is you're running
(I'll bet) in 8-bit color mode. I don't know what framebuffer you've
got, but if you're on an Ultra-1, I wouldn't be at all surprised if
that's the best it can do. Something is eating all your colors,
causing other applications not to be able to have the ones they want.
fvwm2 should automatically limit itself to a small number of colors,
via the ColorLimit command (I'm not sure this is true in 2.2.4). You
may want to consider using ColorLimit in your .fvwm2rc.

Yup, that's the problem.

If you  only have 8  bit color, you  can expect to have  problems with
color allocation.

You can tell how much color the X server  has by looking at the output
of "xdpyinfo".

If you are restricted to 256 colors, (8 bit color), add this line to
the front of your .fvwm2rc:

ColorLimit 61

If you are running Netscape, always start Netscape with the "-install"
flag.

Your mail covered a lot of ground, but the only error messages
I see have to do with color allocation.  If you have more issues,
let us know.

Paul,
I was not sure if you had received my previous e-mail. I therefore thought
it better to send in the mail once more with the answers:

What version of FVWM are you using?  (send the results of "fvwm2 -version")
Any special things about how it was compiled?
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The version being used is 2.2.2. By compilation, are
you hinting at the fvwm2 X-window manager compilation, or the compilation of
my application?

What platform/operating system are you using?
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The uname -a command tells the following:
SunOS nwdvdc026.ny.ficc.gs.com 5.6 Generic_105181-17 sun4u sparc
SUNW,Ultra-5_10.

If you know, what widget set is your application using (Motif, OpenWin,
etc., or maybe it's a Java app?  Tcl/Tk?  Perl/Tk?)
[RAMASWAMY, KARTHIK] The widget set used is Motif.

Merci Beaucoup,
Karthik Ramaswamy

I heard a rumor that you could just rename the executables instead
of replacing them.  This didn't seem to work for me on my NFS mounted
filesystem and Solaris machines.

Instead I configure fvwm to install in a directory containing the release
number, and use a shell named fvwm2 to put fvwm in my path and then
start up the "current" fvwm from the shell.

I think we wanted to know what version of fvwm you are using.
I know someone at GS was making modifications to fvwm.  I assume
this is not that version of fvwm.

It might be helpful if you download a recent snapshot and see if
you have the same problem with the snapshot.

OK, I've had a U5 and never noticed this problem although I'm not
sure I have an application that does exactly what you describe.

> If you know, what widget set is your application using (Motif, OpenWin,

Do you think you could supply sample code to demonstrate the problem?

How long of a delay is this?

I think you need to use Solaris 8 to get timestamps in truss,
but attaching truss to the client process might be helpful if the
hangup is in something the client is waiting for.

We like to delude ourselves into thinking the fvwm2 man page is
adequate for this job.  Some people have told us its very well
written.

We also have a FAQ.

There are a few themes packages that you can use to
configure fvwm with a GUI.  Look on our links page for the
Official FVWM Themes Home Page.

I don't think it's my color mode because I have added
fvwm to my cde login prompt and I can log in from
there with no errors or anything.  I got the
instructions on how to do this from:

http://twirl.mcc.ac.uk/~zzassgl/wm.html

Like I said, these errors only happen when I launch
fvwm from command line login.

#/usr/openwin/bin/xinit
#/home/frosbyte/usr/bin/fvwm2 &

Any ideas?
Thanks for all your help and patience guys!

You had 2 suggestions to add the ColorLimit command to your .fvwm2rc.
With 2.2.4, ColorLimiting is not automatic.  Did you do that?

Do you know if you have 8 bit color or not?  Its possible, fvwm is
not using the right visual, but you're not supplying any information.
If you don't understand the question, just post the output of
xdpyinfo.

Fvwm will use more color than dtwm or olwm if you let it.
If you are using 8 bit color, make sure you don't try to decorate
anything with gradients, and make sure you use the ColorLimit command.
It must be at the front of your .fvwm2rc.

As for the 2 different methods of starting fvwm causing the problem, I
don't know.   But  right now, I   don't know which   problem you have,
(running  out of color, or  using the wrong  visual).  Maybe the error
messages are just hidden from you when you use the other method.

I did add ColorLimit 61 to my .fvwm2rc file.  But it
didn't work.  My mail still comes up white, and I have
blank xterms with or without "ColorLimit 61" added to
my .fvwm2rc file.

I'm not sure if I'm running 8 bit mode.  I can't run
m64config -prconf but I can run ffbconfig and this is
what I get:

frosbyte% ffbconfig -prconf

I have hear similar reports several times, but I don't have a clue
what could cause them.  If I'd knew a way to reproduce this on my
Linux machine I would start debugging immediately.  Unfortunately
the problem seems to be restricted to Solaris.

Would it be possible for you to strip down your source code to a
small sample application that only creates this kind of popup
window and still shows the problem and send it to us?  Or if you
can't send this out of your company, create a new sample program?
It will be very helpful to know what the application is doing in
terms of X.

ROFL!  I guess it's more that we hope for a volunteer to write
this :-)

Once I read a discussion in a news group about vi/emacs.  One
person claimed that vi were very user friendly (and probably
self explaining - can't remember).  The best answer he got was:
You can say a lot about vi, but if you think it's user friendly
you must be on drugs :-)

The people who say our man page is user friendly must be
taking real strong drugs :-)=)

Sorry for the off-topic - after debugging the grab code for 8
hours need some fun :)

I usally start it up as FvwmCommandS /tmp/FvwmCommand-$[DISPLAY]

That way I can't step on anybody else.

Why doesn't fvwm2 have a themes page at this site anymore?

Or better yet, since fvwm2 is embarking on gnome compliancy, is
it possible to get it's themes page reinstated at this web site?

I've been an fvwm2 user for a long time, and I really don't want
to use any other window manager.

Thanks,

-Dave

Because the first and then the second maintainers either lost an interest
some time ago or had no free time on this work anymore. Add also a luck of
new theme contributions. You probably know, themes.org is not a static web
site. Sections which are not updated for months have no much sense.

It is possible once there are some enthusiasts in the FVWM Themes area to
spend their time (probably on a daily basis) to maintain the site. If there
are volunteers, they are invited to write about their offer to the list
fvwm-themes-devel@users.sourceforge.net, where all details are discussed.

Very good. Still this does not quite help with fvwm.themes.org. :-)

hi

i have been trying to get my .fvwm2rc files
keybindings to work correctly for my sun keyboard. 
the keybindings are ok when i'm running the same rc
file on my linux (pc) box.

the problem is, i'm trying to get the ATL-Graph key
mapped to be a CONTROL-R key so that 'alt-graph plus
arrow' can move across the virtual desktops but am
having no fun using xkeycaps.  does anyone out there
have a successful .xmodmap that allows the alt-graph
key to work as a control (and also the left 'diamond'
key to be mapped to ALT)?

thanks in advance
ray

I don't see the need to change the alt-graph mapping.
On my Sun Type 4 keyboard, AltGraph is known as "Mode_switch"
with "mod2" assigned as the modifier.

To have fvwm react to AltGraph/Left use:

Key Left A 2 <action>

The left Alt key seems to want to use the Modifier "M".

I have a SUN machine with OpenWindows window manger coming up by default.
How can I change it so that it opens fvwm instead?

Regards,
