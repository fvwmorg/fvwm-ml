You must have an istallation problem.  Are you *sure* you are
running the correct snapshot?  If you open an FvwmCosole window
you can see the version that is currently running.

I assure you the installation is correct.
The version info showing up in the FvwmConsole is `*FvwmConsole version 2.5.11
(snap-20040601)'.

I tried several ways of double-click and found the problem is essentially related
to the moment you click second mouse button, ie. if you click the second mouse
button as soon as you COMPLETELY release Mouse1, the window is maximized, 
otherwise it is fine. I'm sorry I can't explain this any clearer. I hope you can
reproduce this problem.

Regards,
Liu Shidai

No, I can't reproduce the problem.  I'm doing exactly what you
describe, and since I committed the fix it works fine.  I even
downloaded and installed the 20040530 snapshot.  I can't imagine
what else could have gone wrong.

I have just upgraded to fvwm 2.417, and tuning my system .fvwm2rc 
file.  I have never been able to have fvwm place Mozilla when starting 
up.  Mozilla apparently will not respond to a -geometry option.  I 
have just been trying StartsOnPage 1 0, SkipMapping, etc. with no 
effect.  I have gone to running:
Style "*" ManualPlacement    and

any help would be appreciated.

This works for me:

Style "Mozilla*" StartsOnPage 0    0 1, SkipMapping
Style "Mozilla*" RandomPlacement

I found out where the problem is!
It's the 'ClickTime' command,ie.if you set a short clicktime(ClickTime 150)
you can reproduce this problem.
I have a simple .fvwm2rc like this:
#BEGIN
    IgnoreModifiers L25
    ClickTime 150
    TitleStyle InActive -- Flat
    TitleStyle Active -- Flat
    ButtonStyle All InActive -- Flat
    ButtonStyle All Active -- Flat
    Mouse 0 2 A Maximize
    Mouse 0 4 A Iconify
    Mouse 1     TS   A    Move-or-Maximize
    AddToFunc Move-or-Maximize
     + I Raise
     + M Move
     + D Maximize
#END

If you set 'ClickTime 750', doubleclick works right.

Regards,
Liu Shidai

I prefer the behavior of both RaiseTransient and FPClickRaisesFocused,
but when I use both, the following happens: it appears that the
transient's parents are raised, followed by the transient itself being
raised, whenever I click anywhere within the transient window
(regardless of whether it was already the topmost window.)  This results
in a really ugly flickering effect and a superfluous redraw that I'd
really like to get rid of.

Is there any accepted workaround for this problem, or is it a bug?

Thanks,

Hello,

again, MPlayer modified the FS switching code to solve some Metacity 
issues, and in fvwm the fullscreen mode broke again. After adding (when 
going fullscreen) and removing (when going back to windowed mode) of the 
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint, the window decoration disappears. After 
commenting the EWMH code in MPlayer, the things work okay. Could it be a 
fvwm bug?

Regards,

Neither of above options would cause the transient's parent window
to be raised.  Do you mean StackTransientParent?

I need the full config details to judge what happens (please
stripped down to the relevant parts).

Overall, flickering can not be suppressed at all times because the
X11 interface is a bit lacking.  But the case you describe should
work fine.

To be able to say anything on that matter, I need to know the

I want the gimp to start on desk 3, so I have the following
configuration:

Style	"gimp-2.0"	    StartsOnDesk 3 SkipMapping

The splash screen goes to desk 3 without altering my current desk.
However as soon as the main application appears my desk is switched, so
it looks like the SkipMapping is being ignored. 

Does anyone know how to fix this?

Regards,

Chris

I don't have gimp-2.0, so I first tried the pattern "gimp*" but
that didn't match the main gimp window.  Here is what worked for me:

Style "Gimp*" StartsOnDesk 3, SkipMapping, RandomPlacement

Pay attention to the commas.

I have recently try to create a button vector using this script.
It's very convenient but not perfect.
For example, it ignores the line width in the .eps file, ie whatever
line width I use in the .eps file, it makes no difference.
This makes it less usefull.

Gimp 1 works as I expected, it's gimp 2 that is switching the desk.
Using the line above I still get the same behaviour. I know it's
matching because I can get it to start on a different desktop. 

Just to be sure I was doing nothing stupid elsewhere in the config I
created $HOME/.fvwm/testcfg as:

EWMHNumberOfDesktops 6
Style "Gimp*" StartsOnDesk 3, SkipMapping, RandomPlacement

And ran fvwm -r -D -f testcfg. The result was the same.

Regards,

Chris

Okay, when I stripped everything down, I found the problem was someplace
else entirely.  To reproduce, I used this configuration:

DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+ "I" Module FvwmConsole

BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged true

Style "*" FPClickRaisesFocused

With this configuration, click inside the window area of nearly any
transient window (I say nearly because it didn't work with mozilla's
find dialog), and you should notice the flickering.  The
RaiseOverUnmanaged bugopt seems to be what's causing the problem (as the
problem goes away when I remove it.)

If it's impossible to prevent the flickering while using this option, a
note in the man page might be helpful (I can live without the option if
this is the case, and enabled it only because I find unmanaged splash
screens annoying.)

The problem doesn't seem to be toolkit-specific, but it doesn't occur
all the time either.  I reproduced the behavior using GTK1 (1.2.10-16;
preferences dialog in yank), GTK2 (2.4.1-4; preferences window in
Galeon, search window in gucharmap, attachment window in Evolution),
Motif (preferences dialog in Netscape Communicator 4.75), Xaw (from X
4.3.0.dfsg.1-4; resource box in editres), QT3 (3.2.3-2; print dialog in
Konqeuror), lesstif (Motif 2.1, lesstif 0.93.94-4; search dialog in
xpdf.)

Hopefully you'll be able to reproduce with at least one of the
toolkits/applications listed.  ;)

I don't see any problem with latest CVS (fvwm) and the 20040603
CVS snapshot (mplayer).  Can you provide detailed istructions on
what exactly you are doing and the fvwm config?  Does that happen
with an empty .fvwm2rc?

Ciao

Hi,

In my .fvwm2rc, I have a function bound to the edges of the screen
with EdgeCommand (see below for the details).  The problem is that
when the mouse pointer stays on the edge the function is being called
again and again, which prevents fvwm from doing any useful work until
the mouse pointer is moved away from the edge (for example the
scheduled commands do not work).  Can anybody tell me when exactly
the function bound to the edge is called, how can I control the
frequency of it being called?  The only solution I can think of is
removing the edge bindings for a second or so every time the edge
function is called.

The manpage says the following about EdgeCommand

"Function is executed when the mouse pointer enters the invisible pan
frames that surround the visible screen."

but my experience shows that Function can be callled even if the mouse
pointer stays on the edge (and does not reenter the pan frame).

While still on this topic, what is the easier way of testing whether
the mouse pointer is currently over one of the pan frames?

Thanks,

Piotr

Actually the function is (or better should be)
executed/called when the pan frame gets an enter event. For
some reason this event is produced several times if a
complex function is bound to an edge. For example:

   EdgeCommand N Echo EdgeCommandNorth

works as expected while

   AddToFunc EchoFunc I Echo EdgeCommandNorthFunc
   EdgeCommand N EchoFunc

shows the behaviour you describe. This is actually a bug. I
hope we get this fixed soon.

Cheers, Uwe

Hello boys and girls, thought i'd share my screenshot for you to put up on the webpage if you wan't to.
The screenshot can be found at http://spartacus.homeunix.org/pub/screenshot.png .

Description of what it does:
This is my brand new look with fvwm-2.5.8 running on Gentoo GNU/Linux. I use the nanogui window decors and a backdrop i found on the net, also i use icons extracted from a QNX-cd using a script Taviso made. FvwmButtons is used to swallow a pager, the licqwarf, two applets to check used diskspace on my fileserver, a textbased biff and a digital clock, all of which are modifications of the ones found in fvwmthemes. Menus are _slightly_ translucent just to make it look a bit more alive.

Thats about it, maybe i should mention i "stole" alot from Tavisos rc, i kind of used it as an example file for colorsets and the applets. Post it if you like it ;)

Hi all,

I just uploaded v3.1 of FvwmTabs - a huge release!

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

Things have changed a little-bit so current users might want to
peruse the on-line tutorial.

ChangeLog:
- Use mini icons on tab buttons. (including EWMH mini icons)
- Drag-&-drop support. (Tabbers automatically swallow overlapping windows.)
- Note: DND & mini-icon support require FVWM >= 2.5.11. (or CVS > 05-Jun-2004)
- New option: Resize All To Current
- Created menu option: Use Main Titlebar
- Created menu option: Auto Resize

Is it possible to change the MiniIcon for programs that set it
themselves? (I want bigger icons for the programs).

This is not the actual icon I want for gvim but just for the example

Style "Gvim"                    MiniIcon Mutt.png

Doesn't change the icon for gvim. As an alternative, is it possible to
scale the icons?

It's possible to scale icons manually:

You can extract EWMH icons from an app by using:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/tmp/ewmhIcon.pl

Resize them to whatever size you'd like using gimp, ImageMagik, etc.
& then use EWMHMiniIconOverride as Liu suggested.

But, there is no way to get FVWM to do this for you automatically
(at the moment).

gvim-6.1 installed here does not use EWMH hints (the only way to
externally set a mini icon), but if some later version does it, then add:

  Style Gvim EWMHMiniIconOverride

> As an alternative, is it possible to scale the icons?

I don't see this ability mentioned in the man page (hint-hint), so it is
impossible.

Mikhael.

I tried installing the new FvwmTabs (which required installing Tk::PNG
for the sources since debian doesn't seem to have that package).

When I try to start the FvwmTabs module it seems to start ok (got rid
of the startup error messages and ps shows that it is running). However
when pressing Alt-t or trying to open the tabs window using the fvwm
console nothing happens.

How can I find out what the problem is?

Do you override the Alt-t key binding in your .fvwm2rc?

Try executing this line from FvwmConsole:

SendToModule FvwmTabs createNewTabber

Does FvwmTabs output any error messages?

If all else fails, change the debug line to:

Debug => 2

in the FvwmTabs file & restart.

What output do you get now?

Hi, everyone
Here is a function Michael wrote in thread:
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0303/msg00020.html

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) Style $n Title, Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n NoTitle, !Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize

$n is the window's name, but it's not documented in fvwm manpage.

BTW, are there any other implicit variables?

This is an old sample that does not work anymore (CondCase renamed).

This variable is not documented so you don't try to use it. Single letter
variables cause problems and will be removed after 2.6.x.

> BTW, are there any other implicit variables?

All variables are documented in the "COMMAND EXPANSION" man page section.
There are no exceptions, you may safely assume any undocumeted syntax as
unexisting.

In this case, please use $[w.name] that replaces the old name $n in both
2.4.x and 2.5.x.

And nowadays when we have WindowStyle command in 2.5.x, "Style $[w.name]"
is probably not what you want to use. Use this instead sample:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) WindowStyle Title, Borders
  + I TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title, !Borders
  + I TestRc (!Match) Raise
  + I TestRc (!Match) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize ewmhiwa

The one letter variables are obsolete now and should be replaced
by their verbose couterparts, e.g. $n -> $[w.name].  I don't know
why the corresponding parts in the man page were removed.  They
should be kept for reference purposes. =20

Originally the usage of these obsolete variable names produced a warning
(that is better IMHO than documenting the obsoleteness in the man page),
but for some reason you commented these warnings out. :) I don't think
these variables should be silently accepted. A user have no real reason
to use the old names, the new ones are supported in 2.4.x.

Mikhael.

Dear,

We apologize for our unsolicited email.  We represent the fanclub of our own Marieke, who is starting the preselection for Miss Belgium 2004.

Is it just me, or does half of Europe think the FVWM mailing list is a

Well, actually, I already use both SpamAssassin and dspam.  Not much
gets through (and of the two, dspam catches far more than SpamAssassin
does).

My point was that the FVWM list is probably the second lowest traffic
level of all the lists I'm subscribed to, and accounts for maybe 1% of
my mailing-list email, but there's more spam on the fvwm list than on
all my other mailing lists put together.  Seems like fvwm gets spammed
every few days.  The last time I got spam from any of my other lists was
months ago.

There are fairly simple means to secure a mailing list against drive-by
spamming.  Doesn't the fvwm list use them?

Hi Micha,

: With the converted rpm for Tk::PNG version 2.003 it gives a message
: that it can't find Tk::PNG with a self compiled version (2.005) it just
: crashes, no messages.

I'm not sure I understand this, but to find out if its the PNG module
causing problems you can simply remove "Tk::PNG" from the use line in
the FvwmTabs source code. FvwmTabs will spit out lots of errors every
time it tries to load a .png image, but it should still function.

: On startup the following output is given, on crash no output:

That all looks pretty sane, except the last line is probably truncated.

What does FvwmTabs output on stdout/stderr?

In my ~/.xsession file I do a:

exec fvwm >& $HOME/.fvwm/.errorLog

& then any FvwmTabs errors go to ~/.fvwm/.errorLog.
Default would be ~/.xsession-errors? (or is that only stderr? not sure.)

Anyway, I'm interested in a line like:

FvwmTabs (v3.1) started with: Perl 5.8.0, X11::Protocol 0.53, Tk 804.025.

& anything else FvwmTabs might say.

Also, what version of FVWM are you using?

If you're really keen to help out, try & catch me on #fvwm
(IRC: freenode.net - my nick is "scottie7") & we can experiment with a
few things.

SCoTT. :)

Yes, it does.  Frankly I don't agree with your characterization; the
FVWM list gets far fewer spams than, say, the openssh or xfree86
mailing lists.  Yes, the host runs spamassassin.  Yes, it has many
hand-tuned filters.  Yes, they work; thousands of spams are stopped
per day.  I should know, as I'm the one who filters through the ones
that are marked as "borderline".  But if you cannot handle receiving
any spam that accidentally makes it through the filters, I suggest you
leave the list because those filters will simply never be perfect.

And now this thread has generated more messages than the last two
month's spam load on this list.  Please stop it, or contact me
off-list if you want to talk about it.  You could have always done
that: fvwm-owner@fvwm.org is the proper address to contact if you have
issues with the mailing list.

Hi folks...

1. How to let fvwm focus a window when I click on "any part" of it, not only titlebar?

2. Can I make the taskbar become bigger, higher, not rows. I want to put a large pixmap
as the "start" icon.

3. How to let new windows always being focused? For example, when I press the C-M-x combo
to launch an RXVT terminal. it doesn't get focused.

4. Is it possible to make the FvwmPager swallowed in taskbar? If not, how can I 
"emulate" a taskbar with FvwmButtons?


Thank you!

3. Style * FPGrabFocus
4. Use FvwmButtons to swallow FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager

Hello.

How to match a window by a name and class pair?
There is an application - sim, an icq client. It has a feature called 
'the dock'-  a small window. I want to skip this window in the WindowList. But
its name is 'sim', so matching only by name would skip all sim
windows from the WindowList, and its class is 'Wharf' - I don't think that
matching by this is a good idea. So only name/class is unique.

Is there a possibility to match a window by specifying a name and class?

Hi there,
I have 2 key bindings as following:

  Key space A S maximize 0 100
  Key F12   A N maximize 100 100

Then, if I press 'F12' following 'Shift-space',
the window is restore to its original size.
A second 'F11' maximizes the window.

Any idea how to avoid the second 'F11'?

Regards,
Liu Shidai

  Key f12 a n maximize on 100 100
                      ^^^^

But then you can't press F12 to unmaximize the window.

Because there are far too many warnings in some setups.

Okay, but a single warning after the config files have been
processed should be enough.

I agree.  But the fact that one has to replace $n with $[w.name]
etc. should be stated in the man page explicitly.

Hi there,

Eager to try out ScoTT's window specific key binding,
I have installed fvwm-snap-20040608 and found 2 bugs(maybe 1):

  - Key binding in the Root context won't work, for example
    Key F1      R    M    Exec exec rxvt
    it won't start rxvt but pop up the default menu instead.
  - StrokeFunc in the Root crashes X, for example:
    Mouse 1     R    N    StrokeFunc DrawMotion FeedBack StrokeWidth 2
    now when you click the Root, you'll exit X and there is no error msg.

Anyway, good to see more features come into fvwm: )
Thank you ScoTT

Regards,
Liu Shidai

If you really need this, you may write a function that verifies whether
$[w.width] and $[w.height] are more or less $[vp.width} and $[vp.height]
and then unmaximize, otherwise "maximize on". Left as an exercise.

Thank you, I got it.
Another way is using Resize to emulate maximize 0 100.

Root key bindings usually do not work as you would expect as they
are used only if no window is focused.  Try the PointerKey command
instead.

If you report crashes, please always include a stack trace.
Compile fvwm with debug output (i.e. -g option to gcc), then
locate the core file and run

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

and post the output to the fvwm-workers list (which should be used
for bug reports anyway).

Ciao

Thank you, SCoTT. I'm not on the fvwm-workers list.

Well, 'Key F1 R A -' really makes 'Key F1 R M Exec exec rxvt' work as expected,
however, 'Mouse 1 R A -' makes no differences to 'Mouse 1 R N StrokeFunc
DrawMotion FeedBack StrokeWidth 2',ie, it still crashes X.

BTW, both bindings have been tested successfully in fvwm-snap-20040607.

I'm sorry I can't give more debug messages.

Hi All,

    I tried to search the mailing list archives but nobody seems to
have had this problem ...

    - I use wine to start up a windoze app (typically Lotus Notes, but
      I tried it with "wine notepad" too with the same results).

    - I minimize the wine window.

    - I switch to another desktop and return to the original desktop
      (using keyboard or mouse - doesn't seem to make any difference).

    - When I return, the minimized window is restored.

    - If I leave the window in the normal state and leave the desktop
      and return, the window disappears when I return, though a "ps"
      shows that the process is still running.

    I started up KDE instead and tried the same thing. But there was
no problem in KDE.

    I have no special customizations for any events (e.g. fire off
some event when I enter a desktop) - in fact I don't know much about
fvwm events since I don't use them. No "Style"s for wine. No "Style"
for Notes (apart from an icon - that works fine).

    So, is it a problem with FVWM or is it wine (or both)? Is there
some way I can fix it/get around it?

    Thanks.

Koo

Hm, well, mplayer asks not to be maximized via MWM hints, and then
asks to be put into fullscreen state by EWMH hints.  I think the
bug in fvwm is that it allows the transition to fullscreen state.
The mwm hint that tried to forbid maximizing should be removed, in
my eyes.

I think wine is doing something wrong.  It probably thinks that
when it is unmapped (like when the desk is switched) it has become
iconic and then explicitly asks the WM to be iconified.
Ask the wine folks what exactly they are doing when the window is
mapped/unmapped.

Jason,

I just got fvwm  2.4.15-11 from fink running on my box (os x 10.3).  I 
wanted to get a feel for some different themes so I downloaded the themes 
tarball from your website but ran into trouble when I tried to run 
./configure in my terminal window.  I got the following error:

configure: error:
        fvwm-config is not found; try --with-fvwm-bindir
        You need at least fvwm-2.4.8

I tried a couple of things to remedy this, but nothing worked.  I am 
confused because I have a later version off fvwm installed than the error 
states that I need.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John

Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, but:  did you try 

	./configure --with-fvwm-bindir /what/ever/bin

Alternatively, you could try adding the directory with fvwm-config to you
path.  It seems to me that fvwm is probably installed in a non-standard
(or rather, non-unix-standard) location as you are using OS X.

What /have/ you tried?

31.05.2003 Hamburg-Volkspark:

Ruecksichtslos wurde eine Strasse zugeparkt, weil Tuerken am Vatertag im Volkspark grillen wollten. Da ein Rettungswagen auf Grund der Fehlparker stecken blieb und nicht bis zum Einsatzort vordringen konnte, war die Polizei gezwungen, ca. 11 PKWs abschleppen zu lassen. Uneinsichtig blockierten die Tuerken daraufhin die Strasse, verhinderten das Abschleppen und damit das ein Krankenwagen an den Ort gelangen konnte, wo offensichtlich jemand dringend medizinische Hilfe benoetigte. Erst die Unterstuetzung von ca. 25 Beamten sowie der Einsatz von Polizeihunden konnten die Tuerken, die inzwischen die Polizeibeamten attackierten von der Strasse entfernen und dem Rettungswagen somit die Weiterfahrt ermoeglichen.

I've tried out fvwm-snap-20040610. Obviously alot of improvement.
Thank you.

A small bug:
Stroke behave strangely, the latest stroke sequence overrides
all previous stroke sequences.
For example, if you define the following:

  ...    ...     
  Stroke N74123  0    R    A  Exec rxvt
  Stroke N456  0    R    A  Exec gaim
  Mouse 1     R    N    StrokeFunc DrawMotion FeedBack StrokeWidth 2

Then only `Stroke N456  0    R    A  Exec gaim' is successful.
Hope you know what I mean.

Regards,
Liu Shidai

I'm using the module FvwmIconMan with the option
*FvwmIconMan: DrawIcons always

This shows icons for applications like mozilla, gimp, ... but not
for an Xterm. 

I added this in my .fvwm2rc:
Style XTerm       Icon xterm.xpm
but this doesn't help.

How can I define an icon for an Xterm in IconMan?


Thanks

I'm using a GTK application called gpsdrive (http://www.gpsdrive.cc) and
I've got it starting on the correct virtual page and in the correct size
for my kiosk like layout BUT it doesn't seem to want to start in the
correct position.

My screen is 800x480, first 200 px x 480 px is a button bar (pager to be
precise); gpsdrive basicly needs to understand "-geometry 600x480+200+0".

Is there a way to make the gtk app start up in the correct location on the 
screen using fvwm?

Any ideas?

T!

Hi Micha,

: FvwmTabs (v3.1) started with: Perl 5.8.4, X11::Protocol 0.52, Tk 800.025.
: image "" doesn't exist at /usr/lib/perl5/Tk/Widget.pm line 196.
:  at /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.10/FvwmTabs line 464
: 	(in cleanup) Can't call method "name" on an undefined value at /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.10/FvwmTabs line 850 during global destruction.

Oh ok. You're using an oldish version of Tk & it doesn't appear to handle
empty strings as an image name the way later versions of Tk do. I'll
modify FvwmTabs to get around this in the next release. For now, if
you make sure a valid image is specified for the 4 toolbar icons it
should work ok:

*FvwmTabs: killIcon red.png
*FvwmTabs: addIcon yellow.png
*FvwmTabs: releaseIcon green.png
*FvwmTabs: menuIcon green.png

& make sure the .png images are in your ImagePath.

Let me know if this works.

SCoTT. :)

Sorry if I failed to find it elswhere.

fvwm 2.5.10

Excerpt from .fvwm2rc (I hope that's all that may be relevant):
Style "*"	SloppyFocus, MinOverlapPercentPlacement
Style "*"	ClickToFocusRaises, ClickToFocusPassesClickOff

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ "I" Module FvwmAuto 1000
+ "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent FvwmEventNewWindow

*FvwmEventNewWindow: StartDelay 4
*FvwmEventNewWindow: add_window FocusAndRaise

The problem: if some window is overlapped by another, application in it
does not get mouse input until a window is raised (either by FvwmAuto or
by any other means).  But it does get keyboard input.

In fvwm 2.4.16 with identical configuration this problem does not
appear.  Maybe some defaults have changed?

Hi,

I have some questions.  I use a product called Tarantella to display
the FVWM page on my PC running Windows XP.  The FVWM
page is bigger than my PC's monitor.  So, I have to scroll my PC
window to see the different parts of the FVWM page.  This is a
real pain.

The FVWM2 manpage (on page 11, in the section called
"CONFIGURATION FILES") states "The configuration file is used
to describe ... the virtual display size ...".  I cannot find anything that
tells me how to manipulate this size.  My questions are:

1) Is this what I would use to manipulate the size of the FVWM
page/display on my PC monitor?  If so, where can I read about this?

2) If that is not how to manipulate the size of the FVWM page
on my PC monitor, can you guide me to the information I need?

Thanks.

David Gagne

No, actually, if the website is bigger than you screen area, you
can change the resolution of your monitor to a higher number, so the
website 'fits' your screen.

The FVWM man page is refering to the Virtual Pages/virtual
desktops.
Please read this:

No problem.
I hope this answers to your question.

The display size is set by the X Server.
In this case, I believe Tarantella is the X Server.

Hello,

Hope you can help me.  I am an avid user of Fvwm on cygwin.  I couldn't
get by at work without it.  I have been haveing a few issues with it and
decided to upgrade my cygwin first.  After doing that my meta keys
wouldn't work.  I downloaded fvwm-2.4.18.tar.gz and tried to compile it. 
Here is the core of the error that I'm seeing:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I../..  -I/usr/X11R6/include    -g
-O2 -c `test -f 'root_bits.c' || echo './'`root_bits.c
gcc  -g -O2   -o FvwmBacker.exe  FvwmBacker.o root_bits.o -L../../libs
-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lfvwm -lXpm -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11 -lm

FvwmBanner.c:52:25: libs/FShape.h: No such file or directory
FvwmBanner.c: In function `main':

It's like the makefile lost it's mind.  Can anyone help?  I'm trying to
debug the makefile myself but because I'm not familiar with the setup it
is taking a long time.

Attached is the full log of the ./configure and the ./make calls.

Thanks,
Nathan

What happens if you remove this line:

XTRA_PROGRAMS = FvwmBanner

from modules/FvwmBanner/Makefile.am & rebuild?

If that fails, do:

cd modules/FvwmBanner && make clean && make -n

& send us the output.

Incidentally, does 2.5.x compile in your Cygwin environment?

SCoTT. :)

Content-Type: text/plain

Hi all,

<1> How to place Icons side by side without GAP in between?

I use 'Style * IconBox 130 12 800 250, IconFill left top' and 
Thumbnail function from the FAQ to iconify windows. Usually,
the iconified windows are placed this way:

+----------+ +----------+
|          | |          |
|    1     | |    2     |
|          | |          |
+----------+ +----------+  ... ...
+----------+ +----------+
| <title>  | | <title>  |
+----------+ +----------+
            ^
            |-------------- Gap

I want them to be placed this way:

+----------+----------+
|          |          |
|    1     |    2     |
|          |          |
+----------+----------+  ... ...
+----------+----------+
| <title>  | <title>  |
+----------+----------+
           ^
           |--------------- No gap

Any ideas?

<2> How to prevent IconTitle from auto-expanding?

Every time I focus a iconified window, it's title
expands to the length of the title text. This is 
sort of annoying for me because the title text is
too long most of the time.

Any ideas how to cut the title text to fit Icon width,
or disable IconTitle auto-expansion?

<3> StippledTitle of uniconified windows, but not iconified windows.

I use:
  Style * Icon, StickyAcrossPagesIcon

And the iconified windows get stippled titles, which are not looking good.
How can I disable ionified windows' stippled title, but keep stippled title
for sticky uniconified windows?

Thank you VERY MUCH!

Regards,
Liu Shidai

I think you're looking for the IconGrid setting, although I just had a go
and 1x1 pixels is the minimum spacing, so you can't disable it
completely..but it's pretty close :)

I don't think that's possible unfortunately, but one way round it would be
to use IndexedIconName, which would make IconTitle's much shorter. 

> <3> StippledTitle of uniconified windows, but not iconified windows.

I don't think that's possible sorry.

First, check if the program has some option like "remember window
position" or similar.  It you can't find anything, there are a
number of styles in fvwm to tame the application.  Try in the
given order, one by one:

  Style <appname> nopposition, notransientpposition
  Style <appname> nousposition, notransientusposition
  Style <appname> gnomeignorehints
  Style <appname> ewmhignorestatehints
  Style <appname> fixedpposition
  Style <appname> fixedusposition

(some of these styles require fvwm-2.5.x).

Ciao

Hi Taviso,

Thank you very much for your nice tips.
But they don't work as expected. Help me out.

> I think you're looking for the IconGrid setting, although I just had a go
> and 1x1 pixels is the minimum spacing, so you can't disable it

default setting is 'IconGrid 3 3',
now I use 'IconGrid 1 1'(just following IconBox setting).
But the Icons don't get placed any closer.

Here is the related settings:

#BEGIN
Style * Icon, StickyAcrossPagesIcon, FPGrabFocus
Style * IconBox 130 12 800 250, IconGrid 1 1, IconFill left top
#END

> I don't think that's possible unfortunately, but one way round it would be

Now I use 'Style * IndexedIconName', it seems to make the icon title even longer
because the appended <i> number.

Liu Shidai

Try setting: Style * IconBackgroundPadding 0

and depending on your settings:

Style * IconBackgroundRelief 0, IconTitleRelief 0

I can get them pretty close together with these settings.

ahh, i assumed your titles were so long because of a long ExactWindowName
:) 

I suppose the only alternative is to tweak your IconFont...

It works for me too.

Try issuing the above command in FvwmConsole or FvwmTalk.

Otherwise, post more information, mention the fvwm version you are using.

Following a brief mention on IRC, I'm going to throw a suggestion into
the pot for you all to chew on. :) I don't believe this is possible yet,
but some you might be able to suggest otherwise.

The current action of menus works like this:

menu (possible click) --> popup of submenu

Which is great. What I am wanting/wondering is if it is possible to do
something like:

menu (and if clicked before the popup occurs, then launch an
application) --> else popup submenu.

What do people think of this?

Scott,

Thanks for the help.  I have more information since I posted.  I will try
your ideas when I get to work as I don't have the computer I was using in
front of me.

I did, however, try to configure and compile the code on a Linux box at
work and then checked the differences in the makefiles to see what I could
see.  I was looking in about the same place as you are now and I noticed
that when I made it on the linux box the variable EXEEXT was left blank. 
When I cleared this variable on my cygwin build everything when smoothly. 
Originally on the cygwin build EXEEXT was set to EXEEXT = .exe ,  This
obviously is causing some kind of problem.

The original problem that was trying to fix was still there though which
is this:  I have the alt key and function keys mapped to certain things
and they have stopped working.  I guess I need to try something else.

Ideas?

Thanks,
Nathan

I have a fvwmIconMan inside my FvwmButtons. The area for this
IconMan is to large if there are only a couple apps. The IconMan
is then centered. Is it possible to bottom align the IconMan
inside the FvwmButtons?
I found a right, left, center option but not top, center, align.

It's an interesting idea.  But if we ever have configurable
actions for different keys or mouse buttons it's probably easier
to just configure button 3 to the special action.  One possible
difficulty I see is that the popup delay is usually not configured
so that a human can do something before the menu pops up.  It is
meant to protect against menus popping up when the pointer passes
over them.  For example, in my setup (extremely fast pointer
movement with a trackball), it's impossible to hit a menu item
reliably in less than one or two seconds.

Ciao

The FvwmIconMan should be lower.

 RM> The FvwmIconMan should be lower.

  As I understand, to solve this problem you should configure
  FvwmIconMan, not FvwmButtons.

  $ man FvwmIconMan
  .....
  *FvwmIconMan: [id] ManagerGeometry geometry

  Specifies the initial geometry of the manager, in units of but-
  tons. If height is 0, then the manager will use width columns, and
  will grow vertically once it has more than width windows.  Likewise,
  if width is 0, it will use height rows, and grow hori- zontally.  If
  both are nonzero, then the manager window will be exactly that size,
  and stay that way. As columns are created, the buttons will narrow to
  accommodate.  If the geometry is specified with a negative y
  coordinate, then the window manager will grow upwards. Otherwise, it
  will grow downwards.
  ....


  As I see in screenshot, you use something like 
  "*FvwmIconMan: ManagerGeometry 1x0".
  Try to use "*FvwmIconMan: ManagerGeometry 1x0+0-0"
  
  As example you can view my very old config:

  But different actions for one menu item is not implemented in fvwm.
  Am I wrong?

  BTW, 
  Menu of my dreams :) is such menu, where I can emulate emacs-like
  keybindings.  For example:  

  AddToMenu XtermMenu
  + N x "Just xterm" Exec exec xterm
  + C x "xterm with mc" Exec exec xterm -e mc
    ^ ^- shortcut key
     \modificator.

  N - without modificators (so I just press Enter or "x" for run xterm),
  C - control (so I press Control-Enter or Control-x for run xterm with
  mc), and so on like key binding.

  Also in such menu possible to use next constructions:
  N x "xv" Exec exec xv
  C x "xv" Exec exec xv `xclip -o`

  In this case in menu must show only one item "xv".  I.e. if text for
  menu items is the same, menu items should be one.  But this behaviour
  should be discussed anyway (how to show different keybindings in
  rendered menu?  should be modificators affect mouse clicks or not?). I
  just give an example.

 DV> One possible difficulty I see is that the popup delay is usually
 DV> not configured so that a human can do something before the menu

 DV> pointer passes over them.  For example, in my setup (extremely fast

  Also many people not use mouse for navigation in menu.  I use
  shortcuts, and usability of this method is very high.


PS: sorry for bad english, if somebody not understood me I can try to
explain :)

I agree. It wasn't that it had to be before the popup menu is displayed
-- I had just assumed this is what the majority of people would have
wanted. :)

Show-off. :) I'm lucky to just about have a serial mouse! :) I'm
gradually working my way to USB....

I tried "ManagerGeometry 1x0+0-0", but that doesn't make a
difference. 

But I also want to align a 'normal' application like gkrellm to
align to the top/bottom. I could make an area which is smaller
then gkrellm, but I don't like that solution. It may cause
problems with the other FvwmButtons stuff (overlapping).

Here is my config:

  You are right, I answered too fast, sorry.
  ManagerGeometry can't solve you problem - window of FvwmIconMan is
  smaller than FvwmButton's place for swallow it.

  Simplest solution is use FvwmIconMan without swallow.
  I can't found a better way.

  Year ago I tryed to make something like this.  Unfortunately I don't
  remember results and can't find configs :(

  Now I use more simple setup (http://rk.somewhere.ru/gfx/fvwm4.png and
  http://rk.somewhere.ru/.fvwm2rc), and no use swallow at all.

PS: AFAIK there no way to set vertical align in FvwmButtons.

Where is the difference of  "StartFunction","InitFunction" ,"ExitFunction"?
And Which function is used when Fvwm START? and which function is used
when Fvwm RESTART?

Maybe you are running a different fvwm executable on restart, or a
different configuration file.  Double check that you have the
right ImagePath in your config file.

I think FvwmIconMan behaves a bit funny when it comes to
geometries.  I have

  *FvwmIconMan*ManagerGeometry 2x5

With that, FvwmIconMan fills up the whole area allocated by
FvwmButtons.  As far as I remember, it is necessary to specify a
non null width *and* height for this to work.

Hi all

I want to configure fvwm 2.5 to use another mouse cursor; IMHO the default "X"
cursor contrast with a pretty cool desktop decoration. Is there any way to
change it? How?  Could I use a pixmap as mouse cursor?

any help would be appreciated

xsetroot -cursor <bitmap> <bitmap mask> -fg <color1> -bg <color2>
will give you a two colored cursor

You may do this either using external utility xsetroot or CursorStyle
command, see the man page.

Run "FvwmForm FvwmForm-RootCursor" to experiment with different X cursors
and colors.

> Could I use a pixmap as mouse cursor?

You may use special 3 color pixmap as explained in the man page
(search for CursorStyle).

Mikhael.

   I am in the process of writing my first .fvwmrc file and most things are 
going reasonably well except for trying to get a .jpg or .gif (or any file 
for that matter) to be my background wallpaper.  I have tried many many 
different ways but to no avail.  Most of what I have tried have been 
variations of what I info. I found on the web on the subject.  I have tried 
many things similar to:

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I xv -root -quit /Users/albersjohn/themes/images/1.jpg

I am running os x 10.3 with fvwm 2.4.18.  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,
John

Hi.
this is how i do it:

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Test (Init) Exec exec fbsetbg -l

fbsetbg automatically sets the last used wallpaper after you startx :)

you can get it here:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanb/software/fluxbox/fbsetbg.html


This is Better because the path to the image isn't static, so you dont
need to edit the config everytime you change wallpaper.

regards,

Is it possible to make a pop-up osd like display with fvwm displaying
some value?

I would like to show on the screen for a couple of seconds the current
sound volume.

I have a few multimedia keys on my laptop (4) which I know the key codes
for (223, 160, 174, 176) and I would like to attach to actions using
fvwm. Is this possible?

They are currently handled using lineakd, but 5M for handling 4 key
codes seems like too much for me.

In my ~/.Xmodmap (see notes at end of message):
keycode 222 =3D XF86PowerOff
keycode 223 =3D XF86Sleep
keycode 227 =3D XF86WakeUp

This is pretty self explanatory, and you can find XF86-specific key
names (where there are symbols for several 'multimedia' keyboard keys)
in /usr/X11R6/include/X11/XF86keysym.h.  More generic keys exist in=20
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h.  A friendlier listing of the keys
probably exists, but I don't know of one offhand.

In my fvwm2rc:
Key XF86PowerOff A A Exec xscreensaver-command -lock
Key XF86Sleep A A Exec ~/.local/bin/monoff

Again, this is pretty self explanatory--the strangest part is difference
between the REAL key symbol and the define in the header
(XF86XK_PowerOff vs. XF86PowerOff.)

Notes:
You may have to run 'xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap' manually from your
.xsession/.xinitrc/etc.
GNOME 2.6 is evil, and if you're using it, ti will summarily eat
anything you've changed with xmodmap when it starts gnome-daemon.

I'm using xosd to display some text:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmOsdDisplay
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmOsdDisplay
+ I exec echo $0 | osd_cat -p bottom -c blue -d 2

This program also shows the volume level:

> Is it possible to make a pop-up osd like display with fvwm displaying
> some value?

There is xosd from this site:  http://www.ignavus.net/software.html
Included in the package is a program "osd_cat" to display some osd like text. 

> I would like to show on the screen for a couple of seconds the current

That's exactly what I use it for.  I have bindings to my volume-up/down keys like this:

Key F20 A N Exec amixer set Master 2%+ unmute | tail -n 2 | \
    osd_cat -p bottom -A center -c green3 -s 3 -d 2 \
            -f '-*-bitstream vera sans-*-*-*-*-20-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'

be in some other dir on your system))

Hello all,=20

It was not as suggested "BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged {True|On}'".

It was the missing "Style * DecorateTransient".

Thanks and Greetings

Hi there,

	i have a little problem with fvwm (2.5.10). I tend to keep my box
	running for longer time and it happened now for the second time that
	most of the function offered by fvwm are just vanished - like the
	default root-menu my own root-menu and default alt-tabbing.

	I changed only few of the default configuration. i started an
	fvwm-buttons module and changed the title-bar with some
	vecotor-buttons.

	Current uptime is 5 days and before everything worked just fine.

	Last big thing before current state were 2 runs of x11perf and i use
	apm.

	Any hints would be nice.

	Matthias

That sounds suspiciously like a #0.1 issue :)

I seem to have some focus issues using SloppyFocus. Sometimes new
windows will not get the focus (it seems like they get it and lose it
again), this is most notable with vim, especially on new files.

I also have a problem with windows in fvwmtabs not getting the focus
when a window above them closes and when switching to fvwmtabs using
M-Tab. Even commands like maximize and hide title don't pass through
properly, instead giving me the cross-hair to point to the window I want
the action to happen on.

I believe the first problem can be solved by warping the pointer to the
window when new windows appear. How do I do that? I already implemented
that by overriding the WindowListFunc but couldn't find how to do it
for new windows.

Are you using:

*FvwmTabs: bBuggyFocus true

& have you read the associated entry in the FvwmTabs(1) man page?

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/FvwmTabs.man.html#item_fvwmtabs_3a_bbuggyfocus_bool

If this is not the issue, send a minimal .fvwm2rc config & instructions
on how to reproduce the problem. (I don't understand the bit about
"pass through".)

SCoTT. :)

mod1 Alt_L (0x40), Alt_R (0x71)
mod2 Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4 Super_L (0x73), Super_R (0x74)
mod5

I just want to popup the RootMenu when i press the win-logo key anywhere
an d anytime! like this:

### Key Keyname Context Action ######
Key Pause A N Popup "Utilities"
..
Key Keyname(what should i set?) A N(what should i set?) Popup RootMenu

I don't know the win-logo key is Modifier or a common key? if it is

Use "xev" to find out what the keycode and keysym (if any) are.

Then use xmodmap to assign or change the keysym as needed.

- use xev to find the keycode of the win-logo key, for me it is 115.
- in your .xsession for example, add 
     xmodmap -e 'keycode 115 = winlogo'
- then 
     Key  winlogo  A  N  Popup  RootMenu

On this list, please don't top post.

On my system, that doesn't work.
The keysym must be one of the keys listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

(without the XK_ prefix.)

Pick any unused keysym you like.

This should work:

# the windows key
Key Super_L		A	N	Action

# the menu key
Key Menu        A   N	Action

Or the windows key as modifier:

# winkey = Super_L = mod4
Key E           A       4       exec Eterm

Hello,=20

I have written my own keymap and I have for the three Buttons:

  ____ ( '/home/michelle/.xmodmap/de' ) ________________________________
 /
|  keycode 115 =3D winlogo_L
|  keycode 116 =3D winlogo_R
|  keycode 117 =3D winmenu
| =20
|  keycode 161 =3D XF86AudioLowerVolume
|  keycode 163 =3D XF86AudioRaiseVolume
|  keycode 176 =3D XF86AudioMute
|  keycode 162 =3D XF86AudioPause
|  keycode 146 =3D XF86AudioNext
|  keycode 164 =3D XF86AudioPrev
|  keycode 160 =3D XF86AudioStop
 \______________________________________________________________________


But if I load my keymap I get

  ____ ( 'xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmap/de' ) _________________________________
 /
|  xmodmap:  de:107:  bad keysym name 'winlogo_L' in keysym list
|  xmodmap:  de:108:  bad keysym name 'winlogo_R' in keysym list
|  xmodmap:  de:109:  bad keysym name 'winmenu' in keysym list
|  xmodmap:  3 errors encountered, aborting.
 \____________________________________________


Why ?

The others XF86Audio* are working fine...

Greetings
Michelle

Which mean, I can change the /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h and recompile it=

This is not easy because I use UTF-8 and need 11 Languages...

Maybe a Bugreport to include the three Buttons is better...

I made a mistake as pointed out by Dan Espen. We must use a keysym name
defined in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h (for example F15, F20, ...).

I belive the right keyseems for that are Super_L and Super_R for the wind=
ow keys
and menu for the menu key.

For me they actually work out of the box using these. I didn't have to mo=
dify
anything to use:

Key Super_L          A       M       Popup Window-Ops
Key Menu        A       A       Popup Root

(I don't have a Super_R on my laptop's keyboard)

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IS UNTENABLE

By re-analysing Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment and the ideal experiment from which the uncertainty principle is derived, it is actually found that the uncertainty principle can not be obtained from them. It is therefore found to be untenable. 

Key words: 
uncertainty principle; Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment; ideal experiment 

Ideal Experiment 1

                 Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment


A free electron sits directly beneath the center of the microscope's lens (please see AIP page http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08b.htm or diagram below) . The circular lens forms a cone of angle 2A from the electron. The electron is then illuminated from the left by gamma rays--high energy light which has the shortest wavelength. These yield the highest resolution, for according to a principle of wave optics, the microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

However, in quantum mechanics, where a light wave can act like a particle, a gamma ray striking an electron gives it a kick. At the moment the light is diffracted by the electron into the microscope lens, the electron is thrust to the right. To be observed by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A. In quantum mechanics, the gamma ray carries momentum as if it were a particle. The total momentum p is related to the wavelength by the formula, 

p = h / L, where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

In the extreme case of diffraction of the gamma ray to the right edge of the lens, the total momentum would be the sum of the electron's momentum P'x in the x direction and the gamma ray's momentum in the x direction: 

P' x + (h sinA) / L', where L' is the wavelength of the deflected gamma ray. 

In the other extreme, the observed gamma ray recoils backward, just hitting the left edge of the lens. In this case, the total momentum in the x direction is: 

P''x - (h sinA) / L''. 

The final x momentum in each case must equal the initial x momentum, since momentum is conserved. Therefore, the final x momenta are equal to each other: 

P'x + (h sinA) / L' = P''x - (h sinA) / L'' (3) 

If A is small, then the wavelengths are approximately the same, 

L' ~ L" ~ L. So we have 

P''x - P'x = dPx ~ 2h sinA / L (4) 

Since dx = L/(2 sinA), we obtain a reciprocal relationship between the minimum uncertainty in the measured position, dx, of the electron along the x axis and the uncertainty in its momentum, dPx, in the x direction: 

dPx ~ h / dx or dPx dx ~ h. (5) 

For more than minimum uncertainty, the "greater than" sign may added. 

Except for the factor of 4pi and an equal sign, this is Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of an object. 

Re-analysis

To be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A. 

The microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

This is the resolving limit of the microscope and it is the uncertain quantity of the object's position. 

The microscope can not see the object whose size is smaller than its resolving limit, dx. Therefore, to be seen by the microscope, the size of the electron must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit. 

But if the size of the electron is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx, the electron will not be in the range dx. Therefore, dx can not be deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can be seen by the microscope, but deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can not be seen by the microscope. To repeat, dx is uncertainty in the electron's position which can not be seen by the microscope. 

To be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, so we can measure the momentum of the electron. 

dPx is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum which can be seen by microscope. 

What relates to dx is the electron where the size is smaller than the resolving limit. When the electron is in the range dx, it can not be seen by the microscope, so its position is uncertain. 

What relates to dPx is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit .The electron is not in the range dx, so it can be seen by the microscope and its position is certain. 

Therefore, the electron which relates to dx and dPx respectively is not the same. What we can see is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx and has a certain position, dx = 0. 

Quantum mechanics does not rely on the size of the object, but on Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment. The use of the microscope must relate to the size of the object. The size of the object which can be seen by the microscope must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx of the microscope, thus the uncertain quantity of the electron's position does not exist. The gamma ray which is diffracted by the electron can be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, where we can measure the momentum of the electron. 

What we can see is the electron which has a certain position, dx = 0, so that in no other position can we measure the momentum of the electron. In Quantum mechanics, the momentum of the electron can be measured accurately when we measure the momentum of the electron only, therefore, we have gained dPx = 0. 

And, 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

Every physical principle is based on an Ideal Experiment, not based on MATHEMATICS, including heisenberg uncertainty principle.

For example, the Law of Conservation of Momentum is based on the collision of two stretch ball in the vacuum; the Principle of equivalence(general relativity) is besed on the Einstein's laboratory in the lift.

Einstein said, One Experiment is enough to negate a physical principle.

Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment has negated the uncertainty principle.

 

Ideal experiment 2

Single Slit Diffraction Experiment


Suppose a particle moves in the Y direction originally and then passes a slit with width dx(Please see diagram below) . The uncertain quantity of the particle's position in the X direction is dx, and interference occurs at the back slit . According to Wave Optics , the angle where No.1 min of interference pattern is can be calculated by following formula: 

sinA=L/2dx (1) 

and L=h/p where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

So the uncertainty principle can be obtained 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

Re-analysis

According to Newton first law , if an external force in the X direction does not affect the particle, it will move in a uniform straight line, ( Motion State or Static State) , and the motion in the Y direction is unchanged .Therefore , we can learn its position in the slit from its starting point. 

The particle can have a certain position in the slit and the uncertain quantity of the position is dx =0. According to Newton first law , if the external force at the X direction does not affect particle, and the original motion in the Y direction is not changed , the momentum of the particle int the X direction will be Px=0 and the uncertain quantity of the momentum will be dPx =0. 

This gives: 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

No experiment negates NEWTON FIRST LAW. Whether in quantum mechanics or classical mechanics, it applies to the microcosmic world and is of the form of the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. If an external force does not affect the particle and it does not remain static or in uniform motion, it has disobeyed the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. Under the above ideal experiment , it is considered that the width of the slit is the uncertain quantity of the particle's position. But there is certainly no reason for us to consider that the particle in the above experiment has an uncertain position, and no reason for us to consider that the slit's width is the uncertain quantity of the particle. Therefore, the uncertainty principle, 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

which is derived from the above experiment is unreasonable. 

Conclusion


>From the above re-analysis , it is realized that the ideal experiment demonstration for the uncertainty principle is untenable. Therefore, the uncertainty principle is untenable.

The behaviour you see is exactly what you are asking for.  With

  Style "*" ClickToFocusRaises, ClickToFocusPassesClickOff
                                                       ^^^

you're telling fvwm not to pass any clicks on lowered windows to
the application, and this is what you get.  I didn't check 2.4.16,
but if it does not work as described, there is a bug in 2.4.x, not
in 2.5.x.  Try

  Style * ClickToFocusRaises, ClickToFocusPassesClick

instead.  (Note that double quotes around style names are only
necessary if the style contains whitespace or quoting characters).

Ciao

No, if it is so, it is a bug either in name of parameter or in 2.5.x.
It is not a click to focus.  These windows have SloppyFocus style, not
ClickToFocus.  And well, for ClickToFocus windows (now I have no such) I
would not want passing of click.

In 2.4.x behavior is as described:

"ClickToFocusPassesClickOff and ClickToFocusPassesClick controls if a
mouse click to focus a window using the ClickToFocus model is sent to
the application or not"

means that it does not affect non-ClickToFocus windows.

Well, in 2.5.x manpage I found

"ClickToFocusPassesClickOff and ClickToFocusPassesClick controls if a
mouse click to focus a window using the ClickToFocus model is sent to
the application or not. Similarly,
ClickToFocusRaisesOff/MouseFocusClickRaisesOff and
ClickToFocusRaises/MouseFocusClickRaises control if the window is
raised.

Note: in fvwm versions prior to 2.5.3, the "Click..." options applied
only to windows with ClickToFocus while the "Mouse..." options applied
to windows with a different focus policy. This is no longer the case. "

But as I can see, the second paragraph contradicts the first one.  And
then what's the sense of such a change in logic?  From my point of view
this is definitely a mistake.  Well, I know workaround (for each window
window with ClickToFocus style also explicitly set
ClickToFocusPassesClickOff), but what if in 2.6.x there will be
analogous strange logic in this place?

 DV> Try

 DV>   Style * ClickToFocusRaises, ClickToFocusPassesClick

 DV> instead.  (Note that double quotes around style names are only

Sorry, I have not tested this on 2.5.x yet.  If test will fail, I'll be
back :-)

I made it a bit clearer.

The focus code was completely rewritten and cleaned up.  As a
consequence, the old focus related options have become obsolete.
They were replaced by an awful lot of new styles, all beginning
with "FP".  One result of cleaning up was that the focus model
type has vanished from the style names.  As a side effect, fvwm
can't distinguish between a "click to raise" on a SloppyFocus
window and on a ClickToFocus window anymore.

I tried my best to not change any existing behaviour, but in some
rare cases that could not be done.  Sometimes I had to choose
between compatibility and streamlining the set of options.

Actually, from the day the focus logic was rewritten, this is the
correct (and now documented) way to achieve the effect you want.

I hope you understand the logic from my explanation.  Usually,
we're not changing traditional fvwm behaviour just for the kicks,
but sometimes it's compatibility versus progress.  Behaviour in
2.6 is going to change as little as possible.  There are some
things that do change (all of which are easy to circumvent with a
configuration change), and you can be sure I am painfully aware of
them (of course I had forgotten this one).

Use a recent fvwm version.  fvwm-1.24r was already obsolete when I
installed my first Linux system in 1997 :-)  The current stable
version is fvwm-2.4.16.

The funny thing is that the output above claims it's installing
the fvwm-common package with version number 2.4.15.  It may be a
packaging error.

Ciao

Hi,

I was missing a feature to be able to create named tabbers instead of
numbered tabs. This is useful for auto swallow so you don't have to
depend on the ordering of opening the tabbers. Attached is a patch that
implements that. Unamed new tabbers still get number names as before
(the change was quite minimal thanks to using a hash in the original
code ;-)

The syntax is
SendToModule FvwmTabs createNewTabber <name>
*FvwmTabs: autoSwallow(Class|Name|Resource) <appname> <tabber name>

so for example to create a tabber named vim and auto swallow gvim into
it:

SendToModule FvwmTabs createNewTabber vim
*FvwmTabs: autoSwallowClass Gvim vim

If anyone else was missing that also, enjoy

Hi!

I've been playing around with having FVWM (2.5.10) as my windowmanager
in GNOME (2.6). I followed the instructions in the FAQ (2.8), so I am
using gnome-session. Anyway, things seem to be working well, except for
one thing, my workspaces. I've always been using

    DeskTopSize 6x1

so I want the same in GNOME. So I tried 

    DeskTopSize 1x1
    EWMHNumberOfDesktops 6 0

but that seem to mess upp the GNOME workspaceswitcher. Any ideas on how
I to get this right?

Regards,

Where can I find a listing of all of the colors that fvwm can use (e.g. a 
list of colors that work in a .fvwm2rc file).

Thanks,

Do you have /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt ?

You might be interested in this little utility http://gcolor.sourceforge.net/

Hello,

I've been working on it for a while, and finaly I thought it would be nice
to show my work to you people. Most of it I've made my own, although some
stuff is taken from other .fvwm2rcs :)

I would realy like to make it even better, like changing the vector art to
pixmaps, but I don't know where to find the pixmaps, any suggestions?

Here are some screenshots:

http://members.lycos.nl/fishsoft/fvwm_screenshot1.jpeg
http://members.lycos.nl/fishsoft/fvwm_screenshot2.jpeg

and this is my .fvwm2rc (you're free to use it, but I would really like it
to let me know the result or recalll my name in your .fvwm2rc)

http://members.lycos.nl/fishsoft/fvwm/.fvwm2rc

Hope you like it :)
Waiting for reply,
Berry

Cool. Nice and... new. :) But you should really credit people in your
.fvwm2rc file for the parts you have stole.. err, used in your own
config. :)

What about not using EWMHNumberOfDesktops and setting the
number of desktops via the  GNOME workspaceswitcher (right button
click over the workspaceswitcher ..etc)

If you make themes gcolor is one of the most important utilities you can
have hotkeyed! It's a quick Xcolor color browser, and you can build your
own hex color values. Very useful and quicker than opening gimp
everytime you want a color.

I tried this without any luck. The problem seem to be that GotoDesk is
very buggy, or probably the GNOME workspaceswitcher (moving to wrong
desks).

Could it be that FVWM starts counting Desks at 0 while GNOME starts at

Hi, all!

Yes, it really seems like it. I'm having problems with a quoting in
FvwmButtons. The problem is in the line:

*FvwmButtons: (1x1+0+0, Padding 5 5, Swallow "XClock" 'Exec xclock -bg white -fg black -face "Bitstream Vera Sans:bold:size=8" -digital -strftime "%b %d %R" -pa
 dding 0')

For some strange reason the "" quotes in the '' quotes  doesn't work.

This does _not_ happend when I'm not running GNOME (i.e. gnome-session
isn't taking care of the lauching of fvwm).

Forget this. I must have been on drugs while using EWMHNumberOfDesktops
and GotoDesk.

Hi all,

What the following line (from FAQ 7.17) means?

    FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -menter enter_handler

Man FvwmAuto shows the syntax to invoke FvwmAuto:

    Module FvwmAuto Timeout [-passid] [-menter|-menterleave|-mfocus]
    [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

So what's the 'FvwmAutohide' for? Is it an alias? Thanks.

Regards,
Liu Shidai

This maybe rather off-topic.

After read "my first .fvm2rc" message on this list, I'm trying to set up
root-tail on my fvwm desktop. The problem is that I can't see tail from 3
different files; root-tail shows tail of only one file.

The questions is, if I put root-tail in global init-restart.hook file, which
is the user thar runs the program? If is current user, so this may be a
privileges problem, because I have read access only to one of the three files;
if root-tail is executed by root user, I dont't know which could be the
problem. BTW, where can I found logs for fvwm errors?

thanks in advance and sorry for my english

Great, thanks! Applied (with a few mods) & available in FvwmTabs v3.2.

Yup, what good design hey! :)

> If anyone else was missing that also, enjoy

Yep, a couple of other people have asked for this feature.

As a general rule, patches/bugfixes are best sent to the fvwm-workers
list. Many people on the fvwm list aren't interested in such posts.

SCoTT. :)

I have no idea how this could happen.  Fvwm definitely does not
have different code paths for handling quotes.

I want an FvwmIconMan which only shows non-iconified windows. Is this 
possible, or is something similar possible by some other mechanism?

Hello,

I don't know if the right address to write for  my problem. Excuse my
english, I'm french !!!

It's concerning the option WindowShade in the fvwm2. I'm working on a
SUN Sparc 4, with Solaris 2.1, with FVWM 2.4.17.

The problem is : I have an application which manages some windows
(widgets!). SOme of these windows have a mode called 'Suivi' ("Follow"
in english!), which refresh the information contained in the window
every minute. The refresh can, according to the informations founded,
resizes the window.

But, when the window is just minimized at the title bar (with the use of
the WindowShade option), the resize is not possible !
Indeed, I'm doing an XtVaSetValues in my code, but the Window Manager
don't want to resize the window. So in the struct of the shell, there's
always the same width an height.

I've tried with XtNallowShellResize at TRUE, but the result is the same
!

So I don't know how to do it !

Is there a method to force the Window Manager to let me resize my window
!!! Or can I modify something in the fvwm to activate an option that let
me do that !

Thanks a lot for your answer.
Best regards,

Bastien Rabaute

Hi all

I'm confused about where/how to start programs on startup fvwm, and stop those
programs after user logouts.

For example, I'm setting the wallpapper with FvwmBacker from ~/.fvwm/pre.hook
and I want to start root-tail on that background, but I don't know where/how
to exec the program. I want that program stop execution after the user logout,
is this possible? How? Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance and sorry for my english

Currently not, but I'm going to write an option "ShowNoIcons"
similar to "ShowOnlyIcons" that already exists (in 2.4.15 and
later).

Yes, fvwm ignores resize requests while a window is shaded.
That's because some programs examine their position after
resizing or moving, which can be all wrong while the window is
shaded (cosider a window shaded to the south).  Currently, there
is no way for an application to move or resize its windows while
it is shaded (exactly as for iconic windows).

Yes.

I don't know if it's possible in Java.

With the latest fvwm-2.5.10, you can use the style

  Style <windowname_or_class> MoveByProgramMethod UseGravity

for the java windows.  I hope that in future versions of Java and
fvwm this works without the need for a config change.

Same problem, same fix.

Put something like this in your .fvwm2rc:

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I exec Esetroot -scale ~/.fvwm/backgrounds/linux-kill-bill.jpg
+ I exec root-tail -g 1200x100+0-0 -font -misc-fixed-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*  -color blue /var/log/messages

This is i do:
1. I have already install FVWM into my machine, and i commonly enter
FVWM from command console (runlevel 3) with the command'learnman>$ startx'
2. cp /opt/wm/fvwm/fvwm-2.5.8/modules/FvwmSaveDesk/example/xinitrc
~~/.xinitrc
3. The .xinitrc file have these sentences:
...
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
...
xmodmap $usermodmap
...
fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc"
~~~~ I change .fvwm2rc location to /home/learnman/.fvwm/, so i put the
.fvwm2rc file into /home/learnman/.fvwm/ , i think this change is right

4. And I append these keycodes into my ~/.Xmodmap file:
keycode 222 = XF86PowerOff
keycode 223 = XF86Standby
keycode 227 = XF86Wakeup
5. I check my ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc file, it have the sentence:
...
Key XF86Standby A A Menu RootMenu Popup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is test the Key
6. Now i exit FVWM to command console and type"startx" , the key of
XFStandby do not work, i type 'xmodmap -pke |grep 222' to check the key
have setted or not ,the answer is :
...
keycode 222 =
~~~~this is empty, it show me the key have not setted
7.But after i typed 'xmodmap -e "Keycode 222 = XF86Standby" ', and
restart the FVWM(not exit FVWM to command console) , the key works
correctly. Why?

8. By the way, i set some icons into my rootmenu such as:
"%mini.xterm.xpm&Xterm" Exec exec xterm
and i enter FVWM with 'startx', these icos don't display, just display
correctly with restart FVWM (not exit FVWM to command console, just run
restart, and the ImagePath setting is correct).
I think the two problems maybe is one same question, but i can not check
out the answer.

Please.....
Yours
learnman

Hi everyone,

I got 2 questions:

(1) Does FvwmAuto support alias?
Here is an example in FAQ 7.17
  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -menter enter_handler
Is FvwmAutohide an alias of FvwmAuto?

(2)How to get the number of windows opened in current page?

Regards,
Liu Shidai

I don't think FvwmSaveDesk is in good shape and I don't recommend
using it.  Also using M4 isn't simple.

Try starting fvwm from your .xinitrc with:

exec fvwm

Also remove any .fvwm2rc file that you have and press F1 after you
start fvwm.  Choose one of the options from the menu that creates
a config file.

See another thread. Please wait for 2 weeks before reposting questions.

> (2)How to get the number of windows opened in current page?

There are several hacky ways, one of them is:

  DestroyFunc ShowNumberOfWindowsOnTheCurrentPage
  AddToFunc   ShowNumberOfWindowsOnTheCurrentPage
  + I SetEnv NUMBER_OF_WINDOWS 0
  + I All (CurrentPage) PipeRead 'echo SetEnv NUMBER_OF_WINDOWS \
        $$$$(($$$$NUMBER_OF_WINDOWS + 1))'
  + I Exec xmessage 'There are $[NUMBER_OF_WINDOWS] windows'

But I don't know what is your final task, maybe it may be solved easier
without calculating the exact number of windows.

Mikhael.

The quoted line is a bit hacky although it works.

FvwmAuto does not currently support aliases. However, fvwm tries to
support them in the dumb mode, i.e. anything that looks like an alias is
considered one.

So, in this case, FvwmAuto simply considers any incorrect string like
"FvwmAutohide" as the timeout 0. But the side effect is that you may kill
this FvwmAuto module without affecting other FvwmAuto invocations using:

  KillModule FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide

The correct line would be of course:

  FvwmAuto 0 -menter enter_handler

or (when/if FvwmAuto starts to support aliases):

  FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide 0 -menter enter_handler

I think one of these 2 solutions should be applied to this FAQ entry so
we don't receive such questions anymore.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks, I ran into that a bit later and it solves the problem in most
cases. Some windows refuse to get focus this way when moving from a
tabber to the window (immediately losing the focus again) but its mostly
fvwm-console so its not too annoying.

multi-gnome-terminal accepts input now (it didn't take any input at all
before) although it still crashes a lot when inside a tabber (its ok on
its own), everything else seems to be working fine now (except for
resizing which for some reason is limited to something a bit smaller
then the whole screen, and I can't seem to open a new tabber on fvwm
startup).

Maybe using FvwmRearrange module? See the man page.

Hi,

I have eight buttons in this image
http://bb.zhang.free.fr/images/buttons.jpg
using FvwmButtons.

Can we have the animated FvwmButtons?
For example, the texte on the buttons change the color when mouse pass (like a link in a web page)?

Or can we have this using other module ?


Sincerely,

Bin

  Thanks Dan.  

   I do all that Dan told me.

  The problem which FVWM cann't display icons in Rootmenu did not appears.

  But FVWM still can not read my xmodmap , like the question why FVWM 
can read the command line "xmodmop -e 'keycode 222 = XF86Poweroff'" and 
works correctly, but it can not read my setting in .Xmodmap regardless 
of i append  "xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmap" or not .  

    I've used another method just set these into my .fvwm2rc file, like 
this:
...
InitFunction
+ I  Exec exec xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmap
...
The problem still exists

For keybindings that suddenly stop working, see question 0.1 in
the FAQ.

No, FvwmButtons does not support this functionality (animation or any
other effect when the pointer enters/leaves a button). Anyone is welcome
to implement this functionality.

But in this specific case, why don't you use menus? You may get what you
want, with an exception that the active menu item has a solid background.

> Or can we have this using other module ?

Theoretically you may write your own module using a real toolkit. For
example, in Perl with FVWM::Module::Gtk (or Tk) classes. Then you may
program any widget animation that the toolkit and your imagination allow.
But practically you should know programming that may be not your option.

Regards,
Mikhael.

In fact, I ask this question for my curiosity.  I am very very
satisfied with FVWM and I am very glad to use it.

I want to put these buttons above my small FVwmPager, I don't
understand how I can do that.

I don't know programming. 
Again, it's just for fun.

One thing for sure, this has nothing to do with FVWM.

There are several (at least two common) mechanisms to store some string
in the clipboard/buffer. I have no FileRunner, but if I understand this
correctly, FileRunner uses two different mechanisms at the same time and
stores different strings. Different applications apply one or another
mechanism on the middle mouse button and you get what you get.

> How to fix this?

Please ask on the FileRunner mailing list.

Mikhael.

That should be:

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec exec xmodmap ~/.xmodmap

On my system, the .xmodmap file should contain:

keycode 222 = 86_Poweroff

If I use the "XF", I get:

home> xmodmap -e 'keycode 222 = XF86Poweroff'
xmodmap:  commandline:0:  bad keysym name 'XF86Poweroff' in keysym list
xmodmap:  1 error encountered, aborting.

It is easy to determine the user that runs fvwm (and thus all its config
files), just run xterm from the root menu and type "echo $USER".

If you need a persistent panel, then menus don't quite help right now.
You may tear off menus, but not automatically.

You still have an option to run some funcy animated panel application
from GNOME, KDE or similar, if you find one.

  Some time ago construction "Key -<key> A A <command>" was mean
  "execute <command> when <key> will be released".

  Now such construction return "[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such
  key: -<key>"

  

  Question: how to bind action to key release?



  Also in man FvwmProxy I see: 
  "Key -Meta_L     A   A   SendToModule    FvwmProxy   Hide"

  But this is not working - error received.  Bug in documentation?
  

 
  I read something about it in this list, but I don't remember details
  and can't found no one messages in mailing list archive about it.

If you re-read the manpage, you'll see that the format is:

key <key> .........

No, just a bug in your not reading the man page. :)

I have a desk with 3x3 pages.  I use MinOverlapPercentPlacement.

Fvwm place windows on viewport area only (i.e. only on visible screen
area).  But I want that fvwm placing windows on whole desk, like my 3x3
pages desk is a one big viewport.

How I can do that?  

PS: I can use FvwmEvent for handle new window and move it by bash script
and FvwmCommand.  But IMHO this solution is not a best way.

  I know.  But how I can bind action to key _release_, not press?  In
  early fvwm solution for this task was use "-" before keyname.  Now it
  is not work.

  I have a fvwm 2.5.10.

That feature was added on 2002-11-14 as part of the 2.5.6 release.
It was removed on 2003-03-09 as part of the 2.5.7 release because
the feature wouldn't work reliably.

Yes, it is a bug in the documentation.

I am not sure you will like this. I would find this annoying personally.
It is possible that you will like StartsOnPage better (see also all these
Honors/IgnoresStartsOnPage and SkipMapping). At least you get consistent
results with different applications occupying different pages or desks.

> How I can do that?  

I don't think you can easily do this in fvwm. You may try to do this in X
instead; define your screen size 9 times larger than the physical size
using "Virtual" directive (or something like this). Then you should
probably define your desk 1x1, not 3x3, so it is just one large page.

If you choose this way (that is not good indeed), then better use
PipeRead, not FvwmCommand.

Another (half-automatical) solution is to have a window menu to move a
window to certain page or desk, this may involve MoveToPage, GotoPage and
PlaceAgain. Or just have a key binding for PlaceAgain. Or maybe you will
find ManualPlacement for some or all windows even better (doubtfully).

Mikhael.

If this screenshot is a result of FVWM settings, then I'm waiting for

Ruslan> Question: how to bind action to key release?

If you're really, really desperate, and no other solution works, you
can try the following nasty hack:

In .Xmodmap define your key as a modifier, say Mod5.  Configure fvwm
in such a way that every time your key is pressed you simulate
pressing another key, say F11, using the FakePress command.  Then,
define two bindings for F11: one with Mod5 active and the other
without.  If Mod5 is active, then use the Schedule command to simulate
pressing F11 again in, say, 50ms.  If not, then execute the command
you want to execute on the key release.  Perhaps F11 and Mod5 can be
the same key, but I haven't tested this.

  Hmm...  This behavior is exactly what I want.  But how I can scroll
  viewport by fvwm (or by command-line utility) in this case?  I failed
  to find solution in google.  Also about sticky windows - if I will use
  X features I can't use sticky window, isn't it?

  Now I use Scroll command, and all works nicely:
--8<-------------------------------------------------
DestroyFunc CenterViewPort
AddToFunc   CenterViewPort
+ I Current Piperead "echo Scroll \
      $(( $[w.x]-$[vp.width]/2+$[w.width]/2 ))p \
      $(( $[w.y]-$[vp.height]/2+$[w.height]/2 ))p "

DestroyFunc CenterPointer
AddToFunc CenterPointer
+ I Piperead "echo CursorMove \
      $(( -$[pointer.x]+$[vp.width]/2 ))p \
      $(( -$[pointer.y]+$[vp.height]/2 ))p"

DestroyFunc MyFocus
AddToFunc MyFocus
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
+ I Function CenterViewPort
+ I CenterPointer

Key p	 A 4 Direction North MyFocus
Key n	 A 4 Direction South MyFocus
Key f	 A 4 Direction East MyFocus
Key b	 A 4 Direction West MyFocus
Key l	 A 4 Function CenterViewPort
----------------------------------------------->8---

  I.e. viewport scrolls for placing focused window in center.

  BTW, why WarpToWindow is not moving mouse but moving viewport when
  viewport is not equal to page?  Because of such behaviour I need to
  use CenterPointer function instead WarpToWindow 50 50 or CursorMove 50
  50.

Hi there,

I've just noticed that fvwm TitleStyle command now 
supports MiniIcon as the ButtonStyle does. However,
I don't know how to adjust the position of the miniicon.
It's always placed at the center of the title bar.

I want to put a miniicon to the left of the title text.
Any ideas? Thanks.

Best,
Liu Shidai

The following works for me:
DestroyMenu arabic
AddToMenu arabic "=D8=A7=D9=84=D8=B9=D8=B1=D8=A8=D9=8A=D8=A9" Title
+ "=D8=A7=D9=84=D8=B9=D8=B1=D8=A8=D9=8A=D8=A9"                             =
Exec exec xmessage "Arabic"
+ "English"                             Exec exec xmessage "English"
+ "Fran=C3=A7ais"                            Exec exec xmessage "French"
+ "'Deutsche' enth=C3=A4lt keine Akzente"    Exec exec xmessage "German"

This doesn't look terribly different from your menu, so I suspect the
problem you're having is occurring because the font being used
(-arabic-newspaper-*) does not have any Latin characters.

GTK2 applications (technically, the Pango library) will look for a glyph
in alternate fonts when it isn't present in the user's preferred font,
which may be why this went unnoticed.  (gucharmap, from GNOME, will show
you what font a glyph actually came from if you mouse2 over the glyph in
the character table.)  FVWM does not (as far as I can tell) support
searching through other fonts like this, so the best you could do is ask
nicely that they support this or use a different font.

If Xft is available, the "Arial", "Courier New", and "Times New Roman"
truetype fonts have enough glyphs for all of the characters in the
example menu above, so they should be fine for Arabic, English, and
French.  These fonts are available under a free-ish license in the
"Microsoft True Type Core Fonts for the Web" package, which can be
easily be downloaded using the msttcorefonts Debian package (which is in
contrib.)

Creating constant valued scalar variables is obviously possible with
SetEnv, but is there an accepted way to do anything beyond this?
I have two questions about this:

I  Lets say, for example, that I wanted to create a command that keeps
track of the location of every window on the screen and restores them to
that condition if I press that command again, while ignoring windows
that are new or closed.  Is this possible in fvwm?

These are the big problems I can't solve:
1)  I can't find a non-scalar assignment mechanism.
2)  I can't find a looping mechanism that uses such an assignment
(foreach type looping)
3)  I can't find a way to return the properties of a window. 
4)  Some Window commands don't accept a Window name or id, and will only
use the "current" window. 

II  Is there a way to get the properties from a window newly created
with an "Exec" command (or from multiple windows created from an Exec
command)?

I've looked through all the modules, read the FAQ, and looked at quite a
few fvwm2rc files, but I can't find the answer to these questions. 
Anyone have a clue?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Well, you have access to shell functions with PipeRead, and there's
FvwmPerl, but apart form that I think SetEnv is the only option.

All (conditions) xxx

will loop through all windows, you can add an assignment for each window
that matches.

There are variables such as $[w.id], $[w.width], etc that if accessed in
the context of a window are expanded to that property.

I'm not aware of any, some commands need to run in the context of a
window, but can be prefixed with Pick, Current, WindowId, etc. I think
most commands will use the Pick mechanism if they need to be run in the
context of a window but are'nt?

yes, see #3.18 in the faq.

How about this:

AddToFunc SavePosition I All (CurrentPage) SetEnv Position-$[w.id] "\(True\) AnimatedMove $[w.x]p $[w.y]p"
AddToFunc RestorePosition I All (CurrentPage) PipeRead "echo Test \\$\\[Position-$[w.id]\\]"

Uses a PipeRead though :) You could use FvwmEvent to UnsetEnv variables
as windows are destroyed...

I'm not sure if this needs the new Test syntax in cvs or not.

Fvwm does not support array variables directly.  However, you can
put the array index in the variable name.  For example:

  setenv xpos_$[w.id] $[w.x]
  setenv ypos_$[w.id] $[w.y]

(replace $[w.id] with $w for older fvwm versions).  If you have
the window selected, you can access the stored property like this
by using the functions below:

  array_get xpos $[w.id]
  array_get ypos $[w.id]
  # return values are now stored in xpos_val and ypos_val

With the functions array_init, array_append and array_delete you
can even manage indexed arrays.  E.g.:

  # create new array
  array_init foo
  # append a couple of entries
  array_append foo entry1
  array_append foo entry2
  array_append foo entry3
  # print some entries
  array_get foo 1
  echo $[foo_0] $[foo_val]
  # delete entry2
  array_delete foo 1
  # clean out whole array
  array_init foo

Looping over all aray indices can be done with a shell script via
piperead.

------------------------- snip -------------------------------------
#
# Fvwm based array implementation
#


# Warning: These function can *not* handle quoting characters or
# shell meta characters in variable names or contents.

# $0 =3D array name
# $1 =3D array index

# $0 =3D array name
# $1 =3D array index to delete
# Note: If the array is already empty, this function may corrupt
# the array.  The last entry in the array is moved to the vacant
# slot.

hi all,

For getting unique window name i began to use IndexedWindowName option. 
This option adds a numer of a copy for window with the same name. 
_A trouble:_
If i has an xterm on 3 desk and on 1 desk, fvwm adds a number of a copy to
window title, too.

Is it possible to add this number if a window with the same number situated
only on current desk? 

Thank you for your time.

Hi,

I've been trying to get rid of stippled titles on sticky windows for a couple of days now. Apparently there's no config option to disable that per window basis, now I'm wondering if there is a way to disable them for all windows. I dont really mind having no special decoration on sticky windows.
So far, I haven't come up with anything that would work. StippledTitle does turn them on for all windows, I'd need something just the oposite.

If that's not possible via configuration, I'd be grateful for any tips on how to disable that from source.

I'm running 2.5.10-r5 (on Gentoo Linux).

Thanks for the help.

Best regards,
	Vili

Not yet, alas. I'm hoping that fvwm3 will support this. :)

Masterful answers Dominik Vogt and Tavis Ormandy.   It's not
straightforward, but I guess you can do anything you want with fvwm.

Tavis, with your approach to that problem you're going to be filling the
memory with useless variables, won't you?  I mean, when you're finished
with them, and have closed the window they describe, they're still there
since there's no way to unset a variable (there isn't is there?).

Anyway, you certainly gave me enough info to have an array datatype, so
I guess I'll just do that.

You can with FvwmEvent do something like:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-somealias: *
*FvwmEvent-somealias: destroy_window FvwmFuncUnsetName

DestroyFunc FvwmFuncUnsetName
AddToFunc FvwmFuncUnsetName
+ I UnSetEnv <var>
+ I UnSetEnv <var2>

...etc

I am not sure poluting the environment space of all fvwm processes is the
best solution. An arguably faster, cleaner and easier solution is to use
FvwmPerl to handle any complex data structures, like arrays of hashes.

Here is a fun example. Open some windows and type in FvwmConsole:

  FvwmPerl  # run this only once
  AddToFunc eval I SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $*

  # store position of all non sticky windows on the current page
  All (!Sticky, !Iconic, CurrentPage) \
    eval push @a, { id => $[w.id], x => $[w.x], y => $[w.y] }

  # switch x and y coordinates of windows
  eval foreach (@a) { cmd("WindowId $_->{id} AnimatedMove $_->{y}p $_->{x}p") }

  # some time later, restore original position of windows
  eval foreach (@a) { cmd("WindowId $_->{id} AnimatedMove $_->{x}p $_->{y}p") }

  # warp to the first window if any
  eval cmd("WindowId $a[0]->{id} WarpToWindow") if @a

  # clean up the stored windows data
  eval @a = ()

See the man page and ask if you don't understand something. FvwmPerl is
good for small tasks, for longer ones it is probably easier to write you
own module. I will post a short module (script of several lines) later
today, I need to test a new WindowList tracker anyway.

Mikhael.

Hi folks,

On an amd64 platform there is no Window shown in the
FvwmPager window. On i386 there is no such problem (using
the same .fvwm2rc).

Of course I tried the latest snapshot.


Any idea?


Regards

Harri

Ok, here is the promissed module in Perl that demonstrates one more
solution for storing window positions/names/whatever. This module
requires the latest fvwm from cvs. Save this file as FvwmWindowDance and
call it using the full path with an optional Module keyword. The code
hopefully explains itself.


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use lib `fvwm-perllib dir`;
use FVWM::Module;

my $module = new FVWM::Module;
my $tracker = $module->track("WindowList");

foreach my $window ($tracker->windows) {
	my $x = $window->{x};
	my $y = $window->{y};
	my $name = $window->{visible_name};
	next unless $window->match("CurrentPage, !Iconified");

	$module->send("Move ${y}p ${x}p", $window->{id});
	sleep(1);
	$module->send("Move ${x}p ${y}p", $window->{id});
	sleep(1);
}

$module->disconnect;


Note 1. "AnimatedMove" instead of "Move" does not work well here,
supposedly because of the general fvwm problem with grabbing+AnimatedMove.

Note 2. Unfortunately there are no many window conditions right now
besides the "CurrentDesk", "Iconified". For example "Sticky" and other
flags are definitely missing.

Note 3. This is a transient module, but a long-lived module with event
loop is possible and would be preferable in some cases. All window
information is automatically up to date in this case, it all should be
handled by the WindowList tracker behind the scenes. "fvwm-perllib man".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

I tried to compile FVWM 2.5.10 with the Translucentcy patch (2.5.8) but it
fails at compile time, giving error code 02. What am I doing wrong?

I've been trying out variations on ways to keep track of Windows, and am
not trying the perl module creation technique.
I've run into difficulty debugging:  none of my debugging output
actually shows up anywhere unless I run the module from the command
line.

Is it supposed to?  Of course, I can always just redirect the error to a
file within perl, but is there a standardized way of doing this that I'm
not seeing?

stdout/stderr from each module goes to the same place as stdout/stderr
of FVWM. I suggest adding a line like this to your ~/.xsession file:

exec fvwm >& $HOME/.fvwm/.errorLog

Then all FVWM & module output is captured in ~/.fvwm/.errorLog. I often
run "tail -f" on this file.

SCoTT. :)

Logging defaults to ~/.xsession-errors otherwise.

Reading through the archives, it seems a bunch of years back there had 
been an abortive discussion about making the Fvwm frames able to be 
sized independently. Specifically, the discussion mentioned being able 
to set the top, bottom, right and left borders to different sizes. I'm 
curious how difficult these would be to implement with the current codebase.

Even just a new option for Border/HandleHeight would be interesting. It 
could work the same as the Border/HandleWidth option, but obviously 
would only set the height of the top and bottom borders. Alternately it 
would be better, though probably harder, to make each border 
independantly sizable. Any chance any of this is on the todo list?

Also a question. For a verticle 6 pixel border (drawn in craptastic 
ascii) The colors draw like below.

   _shadow
 /  _hilight
| /  _ hilight
|| /  _ background
||| /  _shadow
|||| /  _shadow
||||| /
||||||

Which when made transparent, makes only the background line transparent. 
The hilight and Shadow colors are still opaque. If I set the border to 
"flat" the entire thing is drawn as the background color and is 
transparent, but lacks contrast between windows without the outer 1 
pixel shadow color. Is there a way to make all but the outer and 
innermost 1 pixel transparent?

Also, the hilight being drawn twice while the shadow is only drawn once 
makes the bevel look really odd/bad. Pretty obvious with a setup like:

Style * Handlewidth 20, Colorset 1
Colorset  1 bg yellow, hi red, sh blue

In any case, thanks for your time all. I've been using Fvwm for years 
and it just keeps getting better and better.

Regards,
Frederick Potetz

-Just testing to see if I am in the right place.
#1)Is this mail getting through
#2)Is this where people can posts any type of questions about fvwm or is 
it strictly technical?

Hi all, I have been looking to moving from fluxbox to fvwm. I have
search the mailinglist for emulating the alt+mouse3 resizing that other
window managers implement.

Most workaround emulate quite well (i.e WarpToWindow, resizing or
involving jumping to closest edge + resizing) but i still feel its too
much of a (ugly?) hack

I was wondering if anyone was working on implementing it as a built-in
feature. If not, i would not might digging into the source code to come
up with a patch myself.

If it is the latter case, can anyone give me a quick start on how FVWM
is implemented? does it use Xlib directly? or is there a intermediate
toolkit/widget class

Thanks so much for this great piece of software. 

David
