related to the GNOME-Panel:

can I bind gnome menus to a mouse button, e.g. mouse button 1 ?
Currently I've bound the gnome-"Start" menu to the 'MENU' key,
so I guess I'd need something like

Mouse 1		R   	A       "Simulate some key sequence"

any hints ?

I just made a patch that allows to place transient windows as any
other windows.  You can get it with the current source
distribution, tomorrow's snapshot or with the upcoming 2.4.1
release (within a few weeks).

If it does not work out of the box for the applications in
question, try

  Style * NoTransientPPosition

and if that does not help try

  Style * NoTransientPPosition, NoTransientUSPosition

I guess I set it up defferently in Debian, I

focus. sorry if I misunderstood.

Hi, so its weekend and Im going for the final round - to make the themes
work.
System: RedHat 7.0, have fvwm-2.4.0 from source, fvwm-themes-base-0.5.0
and fvwm-themes-extra-0.5.0.tar.gz from 

 
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1738&release_id=47495

I made

  1. configure
  2. make

, as local user and

  make install

, as root.


Result:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvwm-themes is successfully installed.
        themes and data: in /usr/local/share/fvwm
        shell scripts:   in /usr/local/bin
Put fvwm-themes-start as the last command of
.Xclients/.xinitrc/.xsession
==============================================================================

Then I made this as root:
/usr/local/bin/fvwm-themes-config --site --install
../fvwm-themes-extra-0.5.0.tar.gz

Result:
Theme awol is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme blackbox is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme brushedmetal is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme mech is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme nanogui is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme osx is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme spruce is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Theme unsafe is successfully installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm

Installation of fvwm-themes-extra-0.5.0 is completed
now "Refresh with no cache" and have fun ...



, ok, so base and themes-extra are installed with the same user, namely
root. So I stop Fvwm2 and run directly (as root)
/usr/local/bin/fvwm-themes-start and get this error:

[FVWM-Themes]: Starting Fvwm under th emain fvwm-themes session.
[FVWM][main]: <<error>> Can't open DISPLAY

, I get the same error, when I try as local user. Also I tried to "make
install" as local user, but then I have to make a lot of "chown" of

/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/share/man
/usr/local/share/man/man1

etc can't remember the rest, is that right?

Before you start fvwm, make sure $DISPLAY is exported and
has a valid value (like ":0").

Alternatively you can add "-d :0" to the command line,
but I think you will be happier exporting $DISPLAY.

Well redhat 7.0 is flawed and has a broken glibc I believe. Upgrade to
7.1 at least.

No need for chown of any files there.

Nope! Try doing "startx fvwm2 -f themes-rc"

Hope this helps.

Hmm, been trying:

export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0
export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0
export DISPLAY=localhost:0
export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

(and ps, its not possible to try the "-d" options (?) )

I get the same error as in the beginning:

  [FVWM][main]: <<error>> Can't open DISPLAY 127.0.0.1:0

, an other thing (wouldn't mention it ealier) - I try with
"fvwm-themes-start" directly. I havn't replaced the "fvwm-themes-start"
in .Xclients, which by the way only exist in /root. The other ones

/etc/X11/xinit/Xclients and
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc has some startup conditions (if I have KDE, Gnome
whatever). I tried to place "fvwm-themes-start" in Xclients, but nothing
happen, well it jumped out on one of the conditions. To be honest, don't
know where "exec fvwm2" gets triggered. Anyway, that's not the problem
right now?

Also, I tried "startx fvwm2 -f themes-rc" (Alex Wallis) wich just
startup Fvwm2 as usual. Ok, hope to crack this one. Thanks. /nikolaj

Frankly Alex I'm ashamed at you replying to this lad and not only giving
advice that clearly doesn't work but not actually seeing the problem
that he is running fvwm-themes-start and not startx as he is supposed
to.  You've hung out in #linuxhelp long enough you pick up on things
like this right away :).

Anyway the the problem is that the script fvwm-themes-start doesn't
actually start up X which it is trying to connect to, you have to start
up X then start fvwm and all it's tools, simplest way to do that is
place fvwm-themes-start in a file in your home dir called .xinitrc,
something like pico ~/.xinitrc will open it, then place 

exec fvwm-themes-start

and when you type startx it should run

I say damn! Its working! Well I have to say thanks - that goes to Jason
Kibblewhite, Alex Wallis, Dan Espen, Dominik Vogt (sorry if I forgot
some) - Im impressed about Fvwm2, nice work, I must say.

"fvwm-themes-start" in Xclients (home dir) did the trick - Xclients
wasn't there after install as root - I thought that was meant to be.

Well, I'll "delve" bask to the themes for the rest of the evening. See
yea.

Hi,

I have the following binding defined in my .fvwm2rc:
Key quoteleft   A       M     Module FvwmPager -transient 0 3

It works fine, except that when pressing the key in an active window, the
FvwmPager is brought up, but the focus stays in the active window. This prevents
me of using arrow keys to move between the virtual desktop. After reading man
pages, I tried this with no luck: Style "FvwmPager" GrabTransientFocus

Thanks for any help in advance.

Regards,

Shao.

Hello!

It seems since I upgraded to 2.4.0 my
"/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc" isn't read when starting fvwm2.
I installed the RH7 .rpm package of fvwm2. After installing the new
version the appearance of the WM had changed but the old config file was
unchanged. However copying the system config (old one) to ~/.fvwm2rc gave
back the old look.
I would like to be able to change the global settings for all users.

One thing that would be nice would be if there was a set of standard
strings (like close, destroy etc.) that would automatically translated to
whatever language is set by LANG variable.
This way you could create a standard fvwm2rc that would still allow users
to see window operations etc. in their native language.

First of all, the right style is GrabFocusTransient, not
GrabTransientFocus.  Anyway, the pager only behaves like a
transient window, but does not set the transient hint for fvwm (I
will fix this), so you have to use

  Style FvwmPager GrabFocus

instead of GrabFocusTransient.  If that does not help, the Pager
may have set the wrong focus policy, e.g. NeverFocus.  If you
can't figure it out on your own, I can take a look at your config
file.

Hi,

see $Subject. I tried to map

    Key Space A M Current (!Maximized CurrentPage) Popup Window

but it doesn't work. If I use another key (e.g. Insert) it works,
so it must be related the the spacebar.

Any hints ?

  I noticed that there is some change in how the new fvwm looks for
startup files. I have found that after upgrading the fvwm read the
~/.fvwm/fvwm2rc (or something like that, I don't remember exact name but
it was in ~/.fvwm directory). The older version (2.2) ignored this
files. As soon as I deleted the file in ~/.fvwm the system one was read.

  NOTE: this was on debian system so it might not apply to you (the
binary debian package might have changed the defaults, not the fvwm
2.4).

  anyway, the moral of the story is: try to run strace on fvwm and you
will see which files it reads (tries to read), so if it reads some
non-obvious files you will find it in strace output.

Hi!

I have a line: Style *           ResizeOpaque
in the beginning of my ~/.fvwm2rc, but it doesn't affect the behaviour
when starting fvwm2 when logging in, but when doing "restart fvwm2" from
the root menu this window behaviour gets in effect.
Why is this?

I attached a copy of the config file.

I can't answer your question directly as I haven't investigated

The man page has something close to what you want but it uses
a mouse button.  Search for PlacedByButton3.

I have tried them all.

GrabFocus/GrabFocusTransient/NeverFocus all behaves the same.
That is, when press the key in the background, the pager is focused, 
when press the key in one of the active window, the pager is not focused.

On the second thought, I would actually prefer the behaviour NeverFocus for
FvwmPager -transient assuming it works, but then I don't know how to turn 
it off using a key.

Thanks for the help. I have uploaded all my fvwm config file here:
http://linux.blueskyhost.com/~shao/fvwm/

.fvwm2rc is renamed to fvwm2rc in order for apache to pickup.

Regards,

Shao.

I had tried this out earlier. When I hit Control-left, the focus shifts but
the focus just vanishes, i.e it doesn't really go to the next desk, where
I have my other windows open.

Hi
Get this dialog box (red background) everytime I try to change a theme.
I was looking in themes-rc and fvwm2rc... could it be that I - by
mistake - left some strange characters (or something) in those files
(couldn't find any though). I had the same problem yesterday, and
managed somehow to change a theme after a time. Any help? Tried to
reinstall themes, without any change (make clean, make install + config
--site --install ... extra.gz.tar (you know the rest). Ok. Thanks.

I suggest the following:
1. "Reset all to the default" (via Theme Management -> Refresh and Reload)
2. Then do not play to much with TM -> multichoice -> fonts

Maybe a better place to discuss these fvwm-themes problems
is either fvwm-themes-devel@lists.sourceforge.org for bugs
and reports and fvwm-themes-users@lists.sourceforge.org 
for "users questions" (see http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/)

There seems to be a lot of zombie processes started by fvwm2 (mostly
'sh').
Is there something wrong with my rc file?
Doing 'ps -AH' shows that these processes where forked by fvwm2.
I suspect they are shells that run commands started through the menus.
Are these run using 'system()' or 'fork()/execv()'? If run with 'system()'
it uses the shell to execute the command, right?

This has been fixed in 2.4.0.

Hi,

I finished compiling FVWM 2.4.0 on UNIX SVR4. It runs OK, but when I try to
exit, it dumps core. The core file contains very limited info even though
FvwmButtons is compiled with -g. This is the stack trace that gdb displays:

Is there any way to debug FvwmButtons module?

FYI, I am using a modified system.fvwm2rc-sample-95.

Thanks in advance,

What version of fvwm are you running?

How are you launching programs, show us one of
your Exec lines.

Do you have "ExecUseShell" in your config file?  If so whats it
set to?

What OS are you using?

Include any other information you think might help us...

For example, setting a background on login/restart

AddToFunc InitFunction 	  "I" Module FvwmButtons
+			  "I" exec xsetbg /home/marcus/images/fuji.jpg

AddToFunc RestartFunction "I" Module FvwmButtons
+			  "I" exec xsetbg /home/marcus/images/fuji.jpg

seems to generate xsetbg zombies after restarting fvwm2.

The config file looked OK, but we can't tell what command
is being used to start fvwm in the first place.  That seems to
be where the problem is.

Mention the version of fvwm, the OS, and the command that
starts fvwm.

I start it using gdm. I have added a session type named fvwm2 to gdm
and a file: /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/fvwm2 containing:

#!/bin/bash
# (c) 2001 Red Hat, Inc.

exec /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2

This is on a RedHat 7.1 system running Linux 2.4.2-2

I will try again and see if this still happens, it might have been
something weird. I'm just to tired to do it now... (too much stuff to save
and so on to log out...)

This is probably not related, but you know that there is a kernel update
for RH 7.1, right?

http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rh71-errata.html


I use RH 7.1 and fvwm2.2.4 with all of the updates and don't have any
problems.  One major difference, however, is that I simply start fvwm
using a .xsession file in my home directory.


There is also a more recent version of gdm on rufus 

http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/rawhide/1.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/gdm-2.2.3.1-17.i386.html

which I'm finding fixes a number of other small problems with gdm...  You
might want to give it a try.  (There are a couple of other packages which
you will also have to install... )

Best of luck,

Tom

The strange is that I'm positive fvwm2 reads my ~/.fvwm2rc because I get
my custom pager, the correct colours the background is set (using
xsetbg) during startup and so on.

Marcus, I don't doubt that fvwm2 is reading your .fvwm2rc file, but I'd be
willing to guess that the problem is not there.  If you put a simple
script like

#!/bin/bash
exec fvwm2 > ~/.Fvwm2-errors 2>&1 

in a file called .xsession in your home directory (with execute
permission) and log in through gdm without selecting any particular window
manager, then the .xsession script will be run, etc.

Do you still have the same problem when loging out?

Tom

I've tried my config at work.
But this is using 2.2.5, a college of mine has compiled it on his home
directory, and my quota doesn't allow me to do it myself right now. And
our sysadmin thinks CDE is good enough for us so...
So Resizeopaque isn't supporten in this version.

But what might be interesting is this:

[GetFontOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get font -adobe-helvetica-normal-r-*-
*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, trying 'fixed'[FVWM][ProcessNewStyle]:

It seems this font style is missing, and checking whith xfontsel indeed it
is missing.
And I ran xfontsel remote on my Linux system and it also seems to lack
this font style.
I'll try and switch it when I get home. I don't feel like trying to run
the hole wm remote (through cable modem...)

I found the problem: /usr/X11/bin/fvwm2 is executed by gdm, this was not
updated when I installed 2.4.0.
So therefore when restarting it uses the correct binary (apparently).

I assumed this would get updated when I did rpm -U fvwm-2.4.0-rh7.rpm
But apparently it didn't.

Hello,

Is there any possibility to compile fvwm2.4.0 staticaly (so be independent on system libraries) ?

If yes then another question - how to ?

I appreciate your help,

Best regards

I see questions along these lines on news:/comp.unix.solaris
every once in a while.  You might want to go to groups.google.com
and do some searches.

I think the consensus, is no you can't, and no, you don't want to.

Don't search for fvwm, search for "static linking".

If you want to staticly link libXpm, that should be easy, just
don't create libXpm.so.
The same thing applies for other optional libraries like readline,
gtk, rplay.

All the X stuff should be on any machine that will run fvwm.

Hi,

I'm looking to a program similar to xsetroot which takes a bitmap
and fg and bg colors but doesn't tile as xsetroot, if the bitmap
is smaller than the root window. What I'm doing is something like

DestroyFunc FuncBackground
AddToFunc FuncBackground
+ "I" Exec exec xsetroot -bitmap $HOME/.fvwm/$[page.ny]$[page.nx].xbm -bg \#386da6 -fg \#3060a0

which gets triggered each time I change pages.
The xbm files are much smaller than the root window and it would be nice
to specify where they should be placed on the root window.

xv can do this:

  $ xv -root -quit -viewonly -rbg red +noresetroot -rmode 5 foo.xpm

Then you should also use the FvwmBacker module (man FvwmBacker).

Refer to the xv postscript documentation for further details.

Hi,

How can I get my rxvt ( I would like not to use xterm )
deiconified when it beeps ( let's say i have a echo -e '\a'
form time to time ) ?

I think it's possible with FvwmEvent, but I didn't understand
how, from the man page.

extra info:
Slackware 8.0 Linux 2.2.19 #93 Thu Jun 21 01:09:03 PDT 2001 i686 unknown
Fvwm Version 2.2.5
FvwmEvent added in the initialisation section of my fvwm.rc

This doesn't have anything to do with fvwm.

Add this to your rxvt X resources:

Is it possible to emulate the following Gnome control panel (I think
that's what they call it) functionality in fvwm:

I'd like to have an autohidden task bar that has swallowed the pager
and possibly a few buttons.

I have set up a command bind to Meta-Tab like this:
Key Tab          A       M	 GotoDeskAndPage prev

to switch to the page (and desk visited last), but I doesn't behave as I
would expect.
Example: I have 4 desks with each desk having 2x2 pages.
Visit desk 1 page (0,0) then desk 2 page(0,0) then desk 2 page(1,0)
Now I use my shortcut, it goes back to desk 1 page (0,0)
So it seems it considers I visited desk 1 before desk 2 beacause the last
switch was within the same desk.
Is this intentional? If so can the behaviour I desire be implemented,
perhaps using FvwmBacker?

Yes, I use all of them.  I'd like to be able to see the desktop again.

Is there some way that I can set them up to, with a keystroke, move them out of
range of the current desktop, and then when I want them back, move them back?
The man pages for Move don't seem to indicate that you can use the bar name:

Key F6    A     M       Move -3000p -3000p MyBar5
Key F7    A     M       Move +0p +5p MyBar5

My X-server crashed so I did a "init 5" from the virtual console (in
linux) to restart it.
Now it seems the zombie problem has gone. I guess the problem is because
my IP changed once when the cable modem disconnected. Then I changed the
hostname with "host <name>". Probably X still used the old
environ. causing problems. Does this sound likely?

Perhaps this wasn't at all related to fvwm...

Dear List,

I have just upgraded my version of FVWM to 2.4.0 and I
have to say that it is awesome. Thank you to everyone
that spends their time contributing to it :-)

I was most intrigued by the "Desker" module. I like
the idea of having a retractable desktop view. My
question concerns this. Before I upgraded,
FvwmButtons, would swallow a 2x2 desktop panel and
place that in
the bottom right-hand corner of my screen.

Is it possible to replace the four desktops which are
currently assigned to FvwmDesker, and make the Desker
module swallow my original 2x2 desktop pane (which is
swallowed by FvwmButtons) and which also takes up the
geometry in the bottom right-hand corner?? I would
also like the side button (the one which retracts and
opens the sliding panel), to take on the height of the
2x2 deskop pane. I have tried everything but I cannot
seem to do it. 

My ORIGINAL module code(s) for FvwmPager and
FvwmButtons are included below.

Thanks in Anticipation,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

Yes, but you probably won't like the auto hiding part.

What you want is a combination of FvwmButtons, FvwmPager and
FvwmIconMan.  First, create an FvwmButtons bar that is located at
the bottom of the screen (or wherever else you want it) and size
it appropriately, then swallow both, the pager and the icon
manager:

  Style TBButtons MouseFocus, Sticky, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip
  Style TBButtons HandleWidth 1, TitleAtBottom, NoTitle
  *TBButtonsGeometry 1024x24+0-0
  *TBButtonsRows     1
  *TBButtonsColumns  128
  *TBButtonsBoxSize  fixed
  *TBButtons(10x1+0+0, Swallow FvwmPager 'FvwmPager TBPager * * -geometry -2000-2000')
  *TBButtons(118x1, Swallow FvwmIconMan 'FvwmIconMan TBIconMan')

  # FvwmPager settings for 'taskbar' emulation
  *TBPagerFont         none

  # FvwmIconMan settings for 'taskbar' emulation
  Style FvwmIconMan WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip
  *TBIconMan*FollowFocus true
  *TBIconMan*Format "%t"
  *TBIconMan*ManagerGeometry 5x1
  *TBIconMan*Resolution page
  *TBIconMan*UseWinList true

Then start it with

  FvwmButtons TBButtons

(put that in your StartFunction).
You may have to fine tune the geometries, though.  The only funny
thing is that the buttons in the icon manager happily fill the
whole 'task bar', even if there is only one window.

Now for the autohiding part.  You need to use FvwmAuto:

  AddToFunc TBEnter
  + I Current (TBButtons) All (TBButtons) WindowShade off
  + I Current (!TBButtons) All (TBButtons) WindowShade on
  AddToFunc TBLeave
  + I All (TBButtons) WindowShade on
  Module FvwmAuto 50 TBEnter TBLeave

Note that this only works properly if the button bar uses
MouseFocus or SloppyFocus. You may want

  Style TBButtons StaysOnTop

also.

Personally, I don't like this kind of auto hiding at all.  I find
it much more convenient to bind a double click on the decoration
hide/show the module:

  Mouse 1 FS    N   Function ResizeOrRaise
  AddToFunc ResizeOrRaise
  + C Raise
  + M Raise
  + M Resize
  + D Current (Shaded) Raise
  + D WindowShade toggle

Bye

Try this config:

  Style FvwmButtons NoIcon, CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip, NeverFocus
  PointerKey F6 A M Current (FvwmButtons) Iconify on
  Key F7 A M All (FvwmButtons) Iconify off

The PointerKey command is new to the 2.4.0 release.  If you have
an older one, try this instead:

  Style FvwmButtons NoIcon, CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip, MouseFocus
  Key F6 A M Current (FvwmButtons) Iconify on
  Key F7 A M All (FvwmButtons) Iconify off

Or if you want to always hide all button bars at once:

  Style FvwmButtons NoIcon, CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip, NeverFocus
  Key F6 A M All (FvwmButtons) Iconify on
  Key F7 A M All (FvwmButtons) Iconify off

I guess nobody thought of this case yet.  I'll make a patch that
fixes it in 2.4.1.  For the moment, You could do so by using a
kind of dynamic function that is changed whenever one of the
Goto... functions is used:

  Key Tab A M MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage
  AddToFunc MyGotoPrevDeskOrPage
  + I GotoDeskAndPage prev

  AddToFunc MyGotoPage
  + I GotoPage $0 $1
  + I DestroyFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage
  + I AddToFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage I GotoPage prev

  AddToFunc MyGotoDesk
  + I GotoPage $0 $1
  + I DestroyFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage
  + I AddToFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage I GotoDesk prev

  AddToFunc MyGotoDeskAndPage
  + I GotoPage $0 $1 $2
  + I DestroyFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage
  + I AddToFunc MyGotoPrevDeskAndOrPage I GotoDeskAndPage prev

Then replace all occurences of GotoDesk, GotoPage and
GotoDeskAndPage with MyGoto... in your config file (should work in
priciple, but completely untested).

FvwmBacker won't help here.

The Iconify part works, but not the de-Iconify part.   As a test I changed the
line: 

Key F7 A M All (FvwmButtons) Iconify off

to read:

Key F7 A M All Iconify off

That worked on everything except the FvwmButtons - they remained icons.

Hi!

Using the 4 desktops with each 2x2 pages setup I described earlier:
I have tried to setup different background for each desktop using commands
like this:

*FvwmBacker: Command (Page * *, Desk 0)	Exec xsetbg 
$HOME/images/circuit.ppm
*FvwmBacker: Command (Page * *, Desk 1)	Exec xsetbg
$HOME/images/clouds.ppm
*FvwmBacker: Command (Page * *, Desk 2)	Exec xsetbg $HOME/images/dunes.ppm
*FvwmBacker: Command (Page * *, Desk 3)	Exec xsetbg $HOME/images/blue.ppm

And I'm starting FvwmBacker module in Init and Restart function.
It almost works. It sets the correct background on startup. And when
swiching desktops via keyboard shortcuts (wich invoke GotoDesk -1 0 0 3
 and GotoDesk 1 0 0 3 repectivly) it sets the correct background.
But when clicking in pager with the mouse it gives weird resultes,
sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't get set when switching to a
different desk but the same page as before and then sets the correct
background if I do a page shift within that desk.

I suspect this might be related to the problem I reported earlier using
the function GotoDeskAndPage prev

I could try and run fvwm2 using .xsession to get debug output in a file if
it might help.

Hi!

I took a look at the wmconfig util that is present in RedHat Linux, it
produces output to generate output for creating rootmenues for different
wms (including fvwm2), this program respects locales. And the output is
generated from *.desktop files that contain lines of the form:
Name=....
Name[de]=....
Name[ja]=....
Name[sv]=....

I thought one might code up a similar tool for creating keywords for use
in the window menu (close, destroy etc.)
So this could be used with 'piperead' in .fvwm2rc

I could code up a simple util that just takes a string as an argument and
reads the appropriate string from a file /some/path/<argument>
using the same approache as the above example.
If someone would be interested in such a util.
I think something like this could be useful for users who are not that
handy with editing rc files by hand, and could perhaps increase fvwm's
popularity internationally.

I forgot to mention I tried to specify each combination of desks and page
explicitly with the same result. Also leaving out the "Page" keyword, only
mentioning "Desk" gives equivalent behavour.

Stupid question, you might think, but where is fvwm2rc
located. Iv'e made the standard installation
(compiled, and no changes of paths) of 2.4, with
Themes-base + Themes-extra (0.5) ? Been looking at the
themes-rc and so on, but it doesn't seem to reflect my
menu?

Finally, Im using "wminet" (can only recommend that
program) and dont want the captionbar, howto remove
that? Tried with swallow, without luck. Thanks. /nikolaj

locate fvwm2rc
find / -name .fvwm2rc* -print
find / -name fvwm2rc* -print
(you get the idea)

Hopefully one of those will return something...

  you can also use strace (or truss in solaris) to see which files it
actually opens.

Ah, that's because of the CirculateSkip style.  You should remove
this style.

Actually, there is no FvwmDesker module that comes with fvwm, so
its hard for me to answer your question.

Just to let you know: I have not forgotten about this report.  I'm
still trying to get access to a HP-UX 10 machine to test this.

Today, many innocent lifes were ended forcefully by the savage
terrorist attacks in New York, Washington D.C and Pittsburgh.
peaking not only for myself but for the users and developers of
fvwm, I wish to express the deepest sympathy with all victims,
their beraved families, and all others who are affected.  Nothing
can ever justify these atrocities.

I plan to dedicate the upcoming fvwm-2.4.1 release to the victims
of this disaster.  The following text will be included in the
ANNOUNCE mail for the release, followed by the names of everybody
who wants to be included:

  This release is dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attacks
  in New York, Washington D.C and Pittsburgh on 11th of September,
  2001.

    <alphabetical list of names>

  and all other users and developers of fvwm.

I ask everybody to allow me to add his or her name to the list.
Please reply to me or fvwm-workers@fvwm.org if I may do so.

Bye

At the moment, I have collected 41 names on my list with more
being added every hour.  I wish to thank everybody for your
support.

I will collect more names at least until the end of the week, and
of course being an fvwm developer or user is no prerequisite to be
added to the list.  So if your friends or family want to express
their feelings in this way, do not hesitate to contact me.

This is the latest version of the dedication message:

  This release is dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attacks
  in New York, Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh on 11th of September,
  2001.  The following people, many of them users or developers of
  fvwm, would like to express their sympathies to those affected:

    <alphabetical list of names>

  and many other human beings who cannot believe one can do such
  horrors and who feel so painful for the innocents that suffered
  then and for those that still suffer.

Hi,

I've according to the manual something like

AddToFunc SwitchToWindow
+ I WindowListFunc $w

Key Tab A M WindowList [CurrentPage !iconic] Prev SwitchToWindow

This works as I expect, but only if I wait for about
1/4 second after hitting the first time <M-Tab>.

If I hit <M-Tab><M-Tab> too fast, the first <M-Tab> launches
the Window List with the cursor placed on the first entry
(as expected) but the second <M-Tab> immediately switches to
the selected window (which is the current window anyway) and
the Window List ist dismissed again.

What's wrong here ?

Hi,

I tried

Style "*"		SloppyFocus, GrabFocus

DestroyFunc Fred
AddToFunc   Fred
+ I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
+ I WindowId "$w" FlipFocus

Key Next	A	C	Current (CurrentPage) Fred


The "Maximize false" might result in the focus beeing on
another window, as I've SloppyFocus. The second line of
the function should bring the focus back to the original
window, but that doesn't work apparently.

Is there something wrong with the above function ?

how can I modify the style of the WindowList ?
-- e.g. I'd like the geometry of the windows NOT to be displayed.

well, I found it out myself: I must not specify the double-click
action.


One remaining question: How can I turn off the title "Desk 0" ?

Hi all,

I do have a question which I don't know if it is appropriate
to this list. I am sorry if not. I am not actually a newbie,
I use fvwm since 4.5 years.

I configured fvwm under Debian to execute some commands
from my ~/bin directory.

For example small scripts to open a xterm with a rlogin command:

========cut here=========
xhost +bambam.chem.tue.nl
/usr/bin/X11/xterm -bg darkcyan -fg lightyellow -bd blue -cr magenta -sb -sl 1500 -j -ls -fn "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso8859-16" -name POTA -title POTA -e rlogin -8 -l tgakic bambam.chem.tue.nl &
========cut here=========

In my ~/.fvwm/main-menu.hook I have:

========cut here=========
...
AddToMenu "/Debian/Hosts" "Hosts%mini-telnet.xpm%" Title
+ "e-mail%mini-mail.xpm%" Exec exec ~/bin/mail
...
========cut here=========


When I click with the mouse on the "e-mail" I get my xterm running rlogin.
The same is happening when I simply call the script from an open xterm.

But they don't behave the same. My question is why? Two differences are
important. The name of the xterm is not the same. The one called from the
fvwm menu is OK and the other called from a xterm show a square made from
dashed lines, a minus, a capital B and then the 8bit character. This is
the same for any 8bit character.

The second difference is that in the xterm opened from the fvwm menu
the input of 8 bit characters are OK, while in the other one only few
are accepted. Example  and  are accepted in both, while ,  or 
are silently ignored.  and  are common in between latin1, latin2
and latin10, ,  or  are not.

I think that somehow the commands executed via the fvwm menu have a
different environment or something. I can't explain why this is
happening. Can someone gave me a hint in which direction to look for
an answer.

Thank you,

Ionel

P.S. This is not new, it is happening since a while. I run
"Fvwm Version 2.2.5 compiled on Jul 23 2001 at 09:35:46"
on Debian woody, 2.2.19 kernel.

When you start the xterm with -ls it runs you login shell.
(Your .profile or .login.)  Perhaps something different is
happening than when you first log in.

The stuff with a capital B indicates a complex string in the
title.  You need fvwm2.4 built with enable multibyte to display
that correctly.  The client application (xterm in this case)
makes the title string
into a complex string.  We've found that Java does that based
on $LANG or one of the other Locale based environment variables.
Perhaps something similar is going on with xterm.

Look for differences in environment variables. $LANG and $LCxxxx.

Well, I did not configure fvwm too much, I was just using it.
So, in a way this is a newbie question.

I loked into doc and on the fvwm site, I found nothing similar.

I access the same command from the fvwm menu and from an xterm.
Yes, the script have xterm -ls, which I know, it reads my .login
and .cshrc files.

So the problem is with xterm? I don't think so. If I call the same
script from rxvt, eterm, konsole, the same happened like with xterm.
The only way to get it right is via the fvwm menu.

Where shall I look for that? I know about the $LANG and $LC_xxxx
in my shell (in my .cshrc), I put that. How I know which 
environment variables are available for a command launched from
a fvwm menu?

All lines of the function are executed before the focus transition
caused by the "maximize false" is handled.  The "flipfocus" part
*does* actually work, but its immediately undone.  To make this
work, the FlipFocus command has to be delayed until after all
events have been handled.  The easiest way I could find is to
use FvwmCommand:

  DestroyFunc Fred
  AddToFunc   Fred
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
  + I Exec FvwmCommand "WindowId $w FlipFocus"

This starts an FvwmCommand process in parallel to fvwm.  Usually,
fvwm handles its events faster than FvwmCommand can deliver the
FlipFocus command (although this may fail if the connection to the
server is slow) since starting a new process and sending the
commands to the FvwmCommandS daemon is involved.

Make sure you start the FvwmCommandS module in your StartFunction
and that you have FvwmCommand in the PATH.

All the options are listed in the fvwm2 man page.  Look for
"WindowList".

This can be done with

  WindowList NoGeometry

I'm not sure if I'd say xterm is doing something wrong.
I don't know if it needs to mark that string as a complex
string to display right.  I suspect that it doesn't.

Maybe you want to take the easy way out and download 2.4.0
and compile it with --enable-multibyte and be done with it.

Do this in the xterm to see whats set:

env | grep LANG
env | grep LC

I'm not quite sure what the difference is either.
You might want to put some print statements in your .profile
and .cshrc while you are trying to figure this out.

Do have $SHELL set?

Do you use the fvwm command ExecUseShell?

Since those xterm I open are doing rlogin I can check it. (They
report the same environment.) I replaced the script with one which
is not doing rlogin, so I stay localy. I run setenv in both xterms
(from the fvwm menu, and from an other xterm). There are differences,
but only in the order of listing. WINDOWID is ofcourse different
and the PATH looks different (longer for the one with problems),
but in fact some path is listed twice.

All LC_ and LANG are the same.

Just add the command

  set > /tmp/environment.$$

to the shell script.  This dumps the whole environment of the
script into the file /tmp/.environment.<process_id>.  Do this for
both types of xterm and compare the output.

I guess the two xterms have different language environment
variables (LC_... or LANG).

Where I can read about this "complex string"? I try to add
a "\" in front of the 8bit letter, also a =16 (Ctrl-V), is not
working.=20

man -k "complex string" give no answer and in man xterm I
can't find complex string either.=20

Hmmm. As I said I have not problem with fvwm, in fact if I open the
script from the fvwm menu, that is OK. If I execute the script directly,
then I have problems.=20

This I get also with setenv. They are OK, this is what I set myself.

My .login (I use tcsh) and .cshrc are read OK.

Yes.=20
>=20

>=20
No. I don't think so. But I can try.

If I replace

+ "e-mail%mini-mail.xpm%" Exec exec ~/bin/mail

with

+ "e-mail%mini-mail.xpm%" ExecUseShell /usr/bin/tcsh exec ~/bin/mail

I don't get anything by pressing the mouse over e-mail,
and in .xsession-errors I have:

stdin: is not a tty

If I replace that with=20

+ "e-mail%mini-mail.xpm%" ExecUseShell /usr/bin/tcsh ~/bin/mail

Then it is the same as the first time: OK.

I just did that and now I understant even less...

diff environment.17839 environment.17844 (xterm versus fvwm)

< HOSTTYPE=i386-linux
> HOSTTYPE=i386

< LANG=ro_RO
> LANG=C

< MACHTYPE=i386
> MACHTYPE=i386-pc-linux-gnu

< OSTYPE=linux
> OSTYPE=linux-gnu

So, the script running from the fvwm menu is in fact running
with LANG=C. Well that is strange, because C means ASCII, 7bit
and shouldn't work. If I change LANG=C in a xterm and I run
the script I get a xterm where the name has no strange characters,
and all 8bit characters can be typed. If now I add 
export LANG=C and/or setenv LANG C in my script then it is not
working.

I should manage now to make it work, thank you.

Still, why LANG=C is OK for 8bit characters, and LANG=ro_RO
(or any other) it is not?

I don't think you can backslash the problem away.

When an application creates one of these titles fvwm displays
it correctly when it uses XmbDrawString to display
the string and displays it incorrectly when it uses just plain
XDrawString.  Somewhere in the man pages, I got the term
complex string for the difference.

I'm trying to figure out what makes xterm think it needs to
put out that sequence...

Ah, now I see your next mail.

When in locale C, X works fine with 8 bit characters.
That strange stuff at the beginning of the tltle
comes from xterm deciding it needs to use multibyte.
I don't know why xterm is deciding that it needs multibyte,
it shouldn't need more than 8 bits even for Russian.

> I should manage now to make it work, thank you.

Good, because I'm beginning to suspect I don't know
what I'm writing about.

I think I have something broke in my locale ro_RO.
I will contact the right people to ask about.
Any other language is OK. I solve it temporary by
adding "export LC_ALL=C" in all the scripts...

Thank you,

hello,

i am using 2.4.0
i have activeplacement set

when mozilla displays a popup, at first the outline of that
window is something pretty big, like the full mozilla
window. however, after i click to place that window, and
after the the popup is actually loaded, it
reduces in size to become whatever size it should be.

has anyone else seen this?

is this something mozilla is not doing correctly, or is this
a problem with my setup of fvwm?

denis

Hi,

there's one issue left with WindowList:

How can I make the second entry already selected if
the windowlist ist displayed by a keyboard shortcut?
Like in M$ Windows.

2.4.0 comes with a conversion script that will take care of
the minor differences bewteen 2.2.4 and 2.4.0.

After you install 2.4.0, try:

man fvwm24_convert

or you can go over to www.fvwm.org, pick "Manual Pages" and then
"fvwm24_convert.1".

Gee, since we all hate windows and think that Alt-Tabbing sucks
anyway I guess nobody ever tested Alt-Tab emulation thorough
enough to notice its a bit inconvenient ;-)

I have written a patch that adds the new option "ReverseOrder" to
the WindowList command.  If you use it, the pointer will start
over the next list entry and hitting Alt-Tab repeatedly (releasing
the Alt in between) rotates through all the windows instead of
just switching back and forth between the last two.

Thanks.  I had two small problems I thought I should report.

First, fvwm-2.4.0-2.i386.rpm requires libstroke.so.0, which is not present
by default on any version of RedHat.  Fortunately, the Mandrake cooker RPM
libstroke0-0.5.1-1mdk.i586.rpm installed fine for me.

Second, I had trouble with fvwm24_convert, because of this:

if ( $source eq "") {
  $source = "$$HOME/.fvwm2rc";
}

and this:

if ($dest eq "") {
  $dest = "$$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc";
}


I don't know what $$HOME is supposed to mean; it should be $ENV{HOME}.

My mistake.  
Its already fixed and will be in 2.4.1.
I should have warned you.

If the stroke library is not present on the machine where fvwm is
build, stroke support should not be compiled in.  Can you provide
the relevant portions of the config.log file generated by
configure?

  seems like a good idea but IMO the name is confusing (I don't even
know why you have chosen it). Since it's new code, can you change it to
something closer to what it does (StartAtSecond, HighlightSecondItem,
MSWinComaptibilityMode or something...)

  and what do you mean by 'releasing alt in between'? isn't it possible
to make it work exctly like in mswin? [window list stays on while alt is
down, tab key moves to next entry]

  btw I consider the way how the alt-tab works in win one of the few
good features of mswin... it's very fast way to switch between
applications (if you're switching between only few of them). is there
any faster way (using fvwm)?

There was no configure, Bart was using an RPM.

I have given it this name because this is exactly what it does: it
reverses the order of the menu entries.  Without this option, the
window list is ordered like this:

  Title
  Window 1 (window with the focus)
  Window 2 (window that had the focus before window 1)
  Window 3 (window that had the focus before window 2)
  ...
  Window n (window that had the focus before window n-1)

and with ReverseOrder:

  Title
  Window n (window that had the focus before window n-1)
  ...
  Window 3 (window that had the focus before window 2)
  Window 2 (window that had the focus before window 1)
  Window 1 (window with the focus)

The pointer alsways starts ofer the first menu entry.

Yes, that still works.  WHat I meant was the case when you pressed
Alt-Tab, then released both keys and later pressed Alt-Tab again.
Previously that switched between the current window and the window
that had the focus before, now it cycles through all windows.

  Key F1 A N Next Focus
  Key F2 A N Prev Focus

You don't have to press the Alt key and never break your fingers
with combinations like Alt-Shift-Ctrl-Tab.  Or even better: With
the Direction command you can get the window much faster:

  # direction bindings
  Key KP_1 A C Direction SouthWest Focus
  Key KP_2 A C Direction South Focus
  Key KP_3 A C Direction SouthEast Focus
  Key KP_4 A C Direction West Focus
  Key KP_5 A C WindowList
  Key KP_6 A C Direction East Focus
  Key KP_7 A C Direction NorthWest Focus
  Key KP_8 A C Direction North Focus
  Key KP_9 A C Direction NorthEast Focus

If I comment out the last "Exec xv...." function, then I do get a blue

which only stays for that session. When I quit FVWM and on relogin, I get the
blue background. Why is my background setting in the GNOME panel not being
displayed?

No, I can't, because I didn't compile fvwm.  I got the binary RPM from the
downloads page on www.fvwm.org and installed it.  I was merely reporting
that whoever built the RPM did so on a machine that had a "nonstandard"
library installed.  The downloads page says it's suitable for installing
on RedHat 6.x and 7.x, but that isn't quite accurate.

No, I haven't seen this, but each mozilla release seems to do
something differently regarding window placement.  Which version
do you have (mozilla)?

Your setup should not have any part in this.

I guess that means that the background is set at some other place
too, perhaps in your .xinitrc or in the .fvwm2rc outside of any
functions.

you are absolutely right. after i switched to 0.9.4 the
problem seems to have gone away, so i assume it was *their*
fault :)

Hi!

I hope the version coming after 2.4.1 (2.4.2?) will be dedicated to those
innocent Afghans who will die as a result to the US retaliation.

You should choose whether to use your own fvwm2rc or the fvwm-themes
functionality in which case you should create your personal configuration
parts in the format that fvwm-themes expects, see the FVWM Themes FAQ.

As for the location of system.fvwm2rc, run the following to find it out:

  % fvwm-config --fvwm-datadir

For compatibility reasons (only) FVWM also searches for system.fvwm2rc in
this directory:

  % fvwm-config --sysconfdir

We suggest to put all system wide configuration files into FVWM_DATADIR
that is by default /usr/local/share/fvwm, or /usr/share/fvwm in rpm.

User configuration file .fvwm2rc is searched in:

  % fvwm-config --default-userdir

that is $HOME/.fvwm starting from 2.3.17.
For compatibility reasons (only) this file is also searched in $HOME.
And to be complete, .fvwm2rc is also searched in FVWM_DATADIR as usual.

Here is the search order, the first found file is used:

  $FVWM_USERDIR/.fvwm2rc        # /home/joe/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
  $HOME/.fvwm2rc                # /home/joe/.fvwm2rc (compatibility only)
  $FVWM_DATADIR/.fvwm2rc        # /usr/local/share/fvwm/.fvwm2rc
  $FVWM_DATADIR/system.fvwm2rc  # /usr/local/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc
  $SYSCONFDIR/system.fvwm2rc    # /usr/local/etc/system.fvwm2rc (compat.)

Note, the existing interface to fvwm-config is intended to be supported
forever (that can't be said for configuration directories and file names)
and it should be used to query your existing FVWM instalation, see:

  http://fvwm.org/generated/manpages/fvwm-config.html

Mikhael.

what are you trying to say? if you are protesting against
_possible_ retaliation, then this surely seems the wrong
place to do that. 

note, i dont want to say whether i agree or disagree with
that point, because i dont want a discussion here. this is
discussed in work-places, newsgroups, chat-rooms, streets.
it does not have to be discussed on mailing lists dedicated
to people helping others to use software programs.

if you are trying to speak out against Dominik's idea, then
you should probably say so. preferrably to developers, and
preferrably in private. there is no reason to just stir up
emotions around here, because i am sure there are people
around here who care about innocent afghans, and innocent
people who died in the attacks (some of them quite possibly
innocent afghans).

please do not take this the wrong way. i am not trying to
tell anyone what to do/not to do/say/not to say/ because
first, i am nobody to do so, second it would not help, and
third i am not a "regular" on this list ...
i guess i am just trying to maybe stop a flame war from
starting out around here

Hi Mikhael
Just read your mail (not at home) - thanks. I'll try
it out when I get back. But still, none of my
system.fvwm2rc or .fvwm2rc files around (locate) has
anything to do with my installation (?) - anyway, I'll
have to read the theme-faq and the other documentation
before asking more, I think. Also to try the
"fvwm-config", never tried it, so maybe it reveals
some other info. Ok, I'll get back. Thanks. /nikolaj

Jesus, that code is too complicated for me!  I tried to find out
what FvwmScript actually does with the SendSignal command or at
least find the list of allowed signals but failed miserably.  From
the strings in the sources I guess that only mouse clicks can be
sent.  I think it wouldn't be difficult to implement an
'EnterPress' signal if I only knew hot to modify the tables in
the script.c source file.

Ah, I see.  The transient pager should actively grab the keyboard
on one hand and asks not to be focused on the other hand.  I will
fix this.  In the mean time,

  Style FvwmPager GrabFocusTransient, Lenience

should help.

Hi!

I have noted that sometime windows are moved to page 1,1 in their desk
when fvwm2 is restarted.
This happens to xv's windows but not mozilla and rxvt f.ex.
I have compiled 2.4.1 myself. But this happend in 2.4.0 also.
This is on a RH 7.1 Linux machine.

Just let me notice a few things:

 - Nothing has happened yet.
 - The life of innocents has always the same value, regardless of
   where they live.
 - It's a completely new situation for me and I am very unsure
   about how to react.  I was very careeful not to write anything
   in the announcement that could possibly hurt others.

Marcus surely wouldn't have put me his name on the list if he
disagreed.

Yes, I am willing to discuss with anybody, but let's not do this
on the mailing list.  Anybody is welcome to sent mail to me in
private, or if there are many list members interedsted in this
discussion, it may be an option that Jason adds a temporary new
mailing list (I can't speak for Jason, though).

There were several rpm questions that are answered in README linked in:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/rpm/

This page suggest to read README before installing rpms, so please do it.
Here are some unsorted notes, all from README.

Our rpms are not compatible with SuSE, Mandrake, RedHat or any other
Linux distribution rpms and never supposed to be such. If you need
distribution dependent rpms, bug your distributor to provide them.
On the other hand our rpms work nicely on several i386 distributions.

The rpms use --prefix=/usr, so the executable is /usr/bin/fvwm2 and the
system wide configuration directory (FVWM_DATADIR) is /usr/share/fvwm.

RedHat (and several other distros) did not provide libstroke rpm yet,
but you may find an rpm that works on RedHat and SuSE in the url above.

New fvwm-2.4.2 rpms will be added when they are created, this may take
some days, please be patient.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, I can create a new mailing list if there's need.  Honestly, though, I
hope there isn't.

Can you explain 'sometimes' in more detail?  What would I have to
do to make it happen on my machine?  How do you restart fvwm
(which options)?

... and does it happen with any applications other than xv?  xv
has a strange notion of window management.  When the WM dies, it
moves itself around and often interferes with the WMs placement
when fvwm starts up again.

It actually only seems to happen with xv's windows. Sometimes was a bit
vague description...
I suspected it might be a problem on application level...

I saw the short thread about "FvwmWinList Transient" coming up partly
obscured, and I'm glad that particular bug has been fixed.  However, I've
noted another difference in the behavior from that of 2.2.

In 2.2, the configuration line

Mouse 3		R    	A      	FvwmWinList Transient

causes FvwmWinList to really behave like a pop-up menu; that is, it will
appear upon mouse down, and one can drag the pointer over it and let go to
make a selection, or move off it and let go and it will vanish without
making a selection.

Now I find that I have to click-and-release to pop up the "menu" and then
click again to make a selection or dismiss.  I really wanted the 2.2
behavior; as it is now, one might as well use the WindowList builtin.

Is there a way to get the 2.2 behavior back?  Alternately, is there a way
to get the WindowList builtin to behave like a real pull-right sub-menu?

Not easily.  I think the reason for this is that the transient
FvwmWinList wants to grab the pointer but can't do so until the
button - and thus the passive grab - is released.

> Alternately, is there a way

Since the WindowList is a simple menu, it should already do so:
Click and release to open it in normal menu mode, push and hold to
open it in 'popup' mode (i.e. its closed when the button is
released).

  I have seen the same thing happen. it also happens when you ask xv to
display another picture and switch to another screen before it actually
displays the picture.

  it looks like the xv picture window is actually deleted and a new
window is created when picture is displayed (or re-displayed, like in
the case of fvwm restart).

Hi !

quite soon, I'm going to buy a new graphics card. The multihead
capabilities of some cards seem interesting, but I wonder how I can use it
with X, specially with fvwm2.

What possibilies do I have ? Can I for example run one seperate fvwm-desk
on each screen ?

First, you need an X server that supports multi head displays.
Most commercial UNIXes have one (but I can't tell you how to
configure it).  XFree 4.x has multi head and Xinerama support
(you'll want the most recent version you can lay your hands on).

Second, you need a supported video card.  If you intend to use two
video cards with XFree, there is or was a big problem in getting
the second card initialised (the BIOS does not do this).  I tried
a number of different card and could run a dual screen setup only
with two Matrox cards.  If you want to buy a single card with dual
monitor support this shouldn't be an issue.

Third, you have to decide wether to use Xinerama or traditional
dual screen.  Xinerama treats both screens as a single big one and
fvwm manages both screens.  Xinerama support is new in 2.4.1.
If you don't have Xinerama you have to use two screens.  This
works basically the same, but you can't move windows between the
screens and have to start a separate fvwm on each screen (fvwm
does this by default if it detects multiple screens).

Hey! I didn't know about that. What exactly is the support
provided to xinerama ? I mean what would be different than
using any WM with xinerama since the WM just sees that there
is one X server and it's huge ?

Thanks

Fvwm knows about the screens of a Xinerama display and makes sure
that windows and icons are not placed between the screens or in
blank areas that are not part of any screen.  Also, there are a
lot of new commands and options to handle Xinerama.  For example
the is a new MoveToScreen command, and the X geometry format takes
an optional '@screen' argument to denote the screen, e.g.

  -0-0@1

refers to the lower right corner of screen 1.  For further details
have a look at the 2.4.1 man page and the NEWS file.

What I want to do is set a background image, them set another image on to=
p of=20
that with transparency, layering the two images. I use to use programs li=

Hi there,

  I use fvwm2 on Solaris. I was wondering what
configuration settings are required in ".fvwm2rc" to
change Mouse settings for X window operations to
left-handed.

Thanks,

Hello,
=20
I have tried to use the mpeg player that comes with SMPEG library:
'plaympeg' from my FVWM 2.2.4 and the -geometry +0+0 option... but it
doesn't seem to honour this parameter.
=20
I don't know exactly if the problem is that plaympeg doesn't take care =
of
this parameter or that FVWM doesn't honour this parameter...
=20
So, if the problem has to do with the plaympeg program itself... I =
would
appreciate any reference to resources in the WWW that I could use to =
learn
how to develop my own application that uses this parameter (the =
geometry
one, I mean)...
=20
Maybe it's a little bit off-topic, so I apologize for annoying =
anyone...
thanks in advance and best regards,

Hi,

I've

EdgeScroll		100 100

1) I'd like NOT to flip pages if I hit an edge, but don't really
   move too far over the edge.  Suppose I hit the edge, but move
   the pointer just 10 pixels beyond the edge. In this case I'd
   never want to flip.

2) If the pointer is moved more than a certain amount (say 100 pixels)
   I'd like to flip immediately.

I played around with 'EdgeResistance' but didn't get the
desired behaviour.

To summarize: I'd like no time to be applied but edge flipping to be
only dependent on how far I move the pointer outside.

Any hints much appreciated.

hello,

i am presently using single desktop as DesktopSize 2x2
and a built-in WinList

Couple of questions:
	
	is it possible to either only show entries which belong on the same page or
	make winlist mark page numbers close to their respective entries?

	can i make winlist stick? (i think you can, so "how" ?)

i tried:

DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
+ "I" WindowId $0 Focus
+ "I" WindowId $0 Raise
+ "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p
+ "I" WindowId $0 Stick (also tried 'Sticky')

but it did not seem to work.

what am i doing wrong?

thanks (sorry if i am missing something that's in the docs)

I'm trying to configure buttons so that each has a different color background (I
could really use this on one FvwmButton bar).  So far I can't get it to work.
I'm using 2.4.0, with the following line:

*MyBar3(4x2+8+6, Back grey40, Frame 4 Padding 10 15, Swallow(UseOld,NoClose,NoHints,Respawn) "xmms" \
   `Exec exec xmms`)

This particular program is too small for the button, so I need to change the
button background to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing.

Suggestions?

Glen

Yes, this would be a very desirable feature to have.
Unfortunately, X does not report any mouse movement when the
pointer has already hit the edge.  Therefore, fvwm has no chance
to get the necessary information from X.  Sorry that I can't help
you.

  WindowList (CurrentPage)

shows only windows on the current page.  Currently there are no
options that enable displaying the page of a window.

No.  The WindowList is simply a menu, and menus block fvwm until
they are closed at the moment.  There are vague plans to support
pinned menus (menus swallowed in a window) some day.  You can also
use the FvwmWinList module (man FvwmWinList) and use

  Style FvwmWinList Sticky

That line makes the selected window sticky, not the window list
itself.

The options of the WindowList command are not described well in
the man page.  You have to guess what they do from their name.
In addition, the WindowList command supports the same conditions
as the "Current" command.

When I first started using Linux I played with several window managers to see
which one I would like the best.  One of them, don't recall which, had a feature
where the window would scroll up into the title bar, leaving only the bar
visible on the desktop.  I prefer that feature over creating icons for windows
I'm not currently using.  I tried to recreate it in Fvwm using ResizeMove, but I
can't get the window to scroll completely up into the title bar.  Depending on
the program, part of the window always shows.  Is there a way to do this - leave
only the title bar showing?

Thanks,

Glen

Try searching for WindowShade in the fvwm2 man page.

I use: Mouse 0 8 N     WindowShade

The command you are looking for is "WindowShade".  For Example, I
have this line in my config file:

  AddToFunc MoveOrRaise
  + C Raise
  + M Raise
  + M Move
  + D Pick (Shaded) Raise
  + D WindowShade toggle

  Mouse 1 T A Function MoveOrRaise

(assuming you have fvwm-2.4.x.  The syntax differs slightly in
2.2.x).

Dominik,

I have 2 screen shots for you to check over if you would.  If they meet with
your approval, please feel free to add them to the collection of screen shots on
the fvwm home page:

Has there been any work done towards making background pixmaps more
customizable (sorta like what Sawmill does). By this, I mean the ability
to have a pixmap specifically for the text of the title bar, then another
pixmap for the remaining space, and pixmaps up and down the different
directions of the borders?

Anyone who's used the default theme for Sawmill on a recent Ximian Gnome
install should understand what I'm talking about. I thought that since
Enlightenment came out, some of this functionality would get worked into
fvwm2, but I don't even see that any work has started yet. I could be
wrong, I haven't looked at the code itself, but there's nothing in the man
pages :-)

Actually, two years ago there was a common consensus between the
developers not to go this way.  We were much more concerned with
functionality than with looks.

If this is implemented I would prefer if it has as small impact as
possible (performance and space), since I like the plain ol' Motif looking
style...

I think we also agreed that if someone wanted to go overboard
on frame decoration, it would have to be done in a module
or a separately loaded shared library.

They're both very nice.

Since you included comments in each screenshot,
I'll extract that for the comment that appears next to each thumbnail.

I like the tan thing you are using as a border pixmap.
Would you send me a copy?

It might be a day or 2 before your images make it to the fvwm site.

Hi lads!

Ok, I saw so many nice fvwm2 screenshots today, I can't hold mine back
now:

Don't expect more than a listing. It's nothing done on the page yet,
like coding or something. Volunteers?

Well, if you think about it, adding a little more customization to the
pixmaps in the title would be a functional decision rather than a "looks"
decision.

Being able to use a different pixmap for the area immediately below the
title would help a designer in using pixmaps for the background. As it is,
I imagine pixmaps for backgrounds on any window are pretty much pointless
unless you've found the magic pixmap that lets your window look good while
not killing the visibility of your title. If you could change the pixmap
for the background area behind the title, it'd aid in making visual
identification of a window easier.

I think an addition like this would be a functional one. Just being able
to change the pixmap immediately behind the title, as well as another two
settings for transitions into the other pixmaps.

Would that be so hard? (I'm being serious, not sarcastic)

Sadly we had an ungraceful shutdown shortly after I posted that (the
NOC lost power and the generator didn't kick in fast enough) and
FTPd wasn't restarted for some odd reason I'm still looking into.

>From the man page:

The  quoted portion of the function tells what kind
of action will trigger the  command  which  follows
it.   "I"  stands for Immediate, and is executed as
soon as the function is invoked.   "M"  stands  for
Motion,  i.e.  if the user starts moving the mouse.
"C" stands for Click, i.e., if the user presses and
releases  the  mouse  in  a  short  period  of time
(ClickTime milliseconds).  "D" stands  for  double-
click.   The  action "I" will cause an action to be
performed on the button-press, if the  function  is
invoked with prior knowledge of which window to act
on.

I think the best place to access this from would be
the /dev/null area :-)

I thought the thread was about broad philosophical topics like designing
the human/machine interface, which I assume *would* be on topic here....

Yes.  It requires a totally different approach of the internal
window layout.

They are described in the 
"COMMANDS FOR USER FUNCTIONS AND SHELL" section
right near the front of the AddToFunc description.
They don't really have a name, they are just referred to
as "The letter before the action".

While on this topic, I would like to ask about the double quotes
around the "C", "D", "M", "I", "H".

Although I see them in many of the examples posted here,
they are not present in the examples on the fvwm2 man page.
I happily omit the quotes in my .fvwm2rc, and things work just fine.

I doesn't matter if you use them or not. I use them,
for asthetic purposes only, since it makes it easier
when editing my "fvwm2rc.functions.m4" file :-)

So either way, it doesn't matter...

I think they were necessary in some obscure, very outdated
version.  Many people simply have not yet updated their config
files and removed them because they are still allowed.  You won't
find the double quotes in the current man page anymore.

This is a followup to message 664 on the bug-list at the fvwm.org
website

We are having similar problems with
 - unpainted gui components
 - window migration to the top left with zero size etc.

when using java 1.3.1 on fvwm 2.2.4

would appreciate any information on whether there is there a fix in the
works ? 

thx

Perhaps you can help me out.  I am running on a SGI
O2. 

I was previously using irix 6.3.  The default window
manager had trouble allocating colormaps when too many
programs were open.  I switched to fvwm 2.2.4 and saw
no colormap issues since.

Recently I was just upgraded to irix 6.5.  The new
default window manager did not seem to have any
colormap issues.  I compiled the latest fvwm 2.4.2 and
the colormap issues have come back big time.  I get
"cannot allocate colormap entry for xxx" after only
having as little as two apps running (ie netscape and
the cdplayer).

I have tried both FollowsFocus and FollowsMouse and it
does not seem to make a difference.  Any suggestions?

Thanks
Craig

JC,

  I've added image 18 and your .fvwm2rc to our web site.
I'd expect it to appear in an hour or so.  You hold the record
for running at the highest resolution.

FVWM'rs,

  I've finally given in, and included the fvwm2rc along with this
image.  Please don't flood me with fvwm2rc's for images already
on the site.  You can send them,  I suppose, but it may take a while
til one of us gets to them.

  I'm not going to keep these .fvwm2rc's up to date.  I noticed
JC's .fvwm2rc was using a few obsolete commands.  Thats too bad,
anyone downloading it will have to figure that out.
I also arbitrarily deleted parts I didn't think were of general
interest.

  If anyone submits one, try to clean it up, remove parts that don't
apply and remove commented out lines, etc.

Focus settings won't make any difference.

You must be running with a limited colormap, most likely
256 colors.  If you think your hardware should allow you
to display more colors, you should look into what you have
to do to accomplish that.  The rest of this assumes you
have to run with a limited colormap.

Netscape will always take all available colors,
if there are 240 colors available when netscape
starts, it will take 240.
You must run Netscape with the "-install" argument.

There are a few other badly behaved applications,
anything tk based (exmh), and FrameMaker come to mind.
Let me know if you are using either of those,
I have fixes for them.

FVWM 2.4.x will automatically limit the amount
of color it uses in icons and pixmaps.
You can't use FVWM gradients with a limited colormap.

I have a program called "colormap" that will show you
the number of free colors in your colormap.  If you still
don't know which program is using up your colors, this
program may help.  If you'd like a copy let me know.

I think I've covered everything in the FVWM FAQ question
6.7, but you may want to check it out anyway.

Based on the latest 2.4.x releases.

I think I saw a hilightcolor command,
its obsolete.

Pixmappath and iconpath are obsolete.
ImagePath is the new command and is only
needed for paths not built in.

You don't need ModulePath.

I've been told that "J2SE v1.4 beta3" which should be released in
a month or so will work better with fvwm.

There may be some fvwm changes coming too.

The fvwm FAQ mentions that the NumLock, CapsLock and Scrolllock keys act
as modifiers and will interfere with key bindings... I have experienced
this problem.  However, the FAQ just says to disable the keys or set
ignore.  Is there a way I can get my key bindings to still work when the
NumLock key is on (NumLock is the only one I care about, and I prefer to
have it on all the time but it doesn't go on automatically)?
For example, some of my key bindings in .fvwm2rc are:

Key 1 A M GotoPage 0 0
Key 2 A M GotoPage 1 0
Key 3 A M GotoPage 0 1
Key 4 A M GotoPage 1 1
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

So alt-1 goes to 1st page of desktop 0, etc.
Is there a change I can make so that it works when NumLock is on?

-John

Hello,

I am running Red Hat 7.1 with fvwm2 version 2.4.2 and xlockmore 4.17.2.
I log into the server via xdmcp from a separate client computer acting
as an X terminal. I find that xlock works fine when I invoke it from a
kde session by pressing a button on the kiker panel but if I run fvwm2
and type xlock at the command line I get the message
xlock: can not lock foo's display
although my DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set to foo:0.0
where foo is the X client computer. Does anyone know why xlockmore
is working under kde but not under fvwm2?

Thanks,

Neil

Try to run xlock on the computer acting as X-terminal, or use the
"-remote" option.

  IMO the best solution is to have each keybinding that you want to work
the same way with or without numLock twice - once with numLock, once
without numLock.

  use xmodmap to find out wich modifier numLock is, on my machine
(linux, debian unstable) it looks like this:

jojda:~>xmodmap 
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Meta_L (0x73)
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

  as you can see numLock is modifier 2 (you can change it using xmodmap,
see man xmodmap), your keybindings would look like this:

Key 1 A M  GotoPage 0 0
Key 1 A M2 GotoPage 0 0
Key 2 A M  GotoPage 1 0
Key 2 A M2 GotoPage 1 0
Key 3 A M  GotoPage 0 1
Key 3 A M2 GotoPage 0 1
Key 4 A M  GotoPage 1 1
Key 4 A M2 GotoPage 1 1
Key Tab A M  WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
Key Tab A M2 WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

  it's kinda ugly, but it's quite flexible, you still can use numLock
and your keybindings work the way you want them. The other solution is
to disable numlock which is not acceptable to everyone...

  the other solution would be to have slightly more complicated syntax
for specifying modifiers in fvwm - adding a way to ignore modifiers for
given key binding, e.g. something like this:

Key 1 A M/2 GotoPage 0 0 

  all modifiers listed before slash would be required to be on, all
modifiers after slash would be ignored, all modifiers that are not
mentioned would be required to be off. Note that it's backward
compatible.

  not sure if it makes sense in overall fvwm design... of course,
something like that could be added as M4 macro (I guess, I don't use
it).

John,

   Personally I prefer the current setup.  Fvwm's keybindings take precedence over
that of an open application.  But the keybindings are disabled if one of the
modifier keys are enabled.  You can use this to your advantage.  
   I use Xemacs frequently, and have numerous key bindings that cross over
between Fvwm2 and Xemacs.  To disable Fvwm's key bindings, I press the scroll
lock key, and am then able to freely use M-Right, M-Left, etc., as defined in
Xemacs.  When I disable the Scroll Lock key, I can then us M-Right/M-Left to move me
through the window layers in order or reverse order.

   To automatically enable NumLock on your keys, on Redhat you can put the
following in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

INITTY=/dev/tty[1-9]
for tty in $INITTY; do
    setleds -D +num < $tty
done

   For whatever reason Linus considers enabling NumLock on startup to be a security
risk, so this feature is disabled in the kernel.

I have a screen shot at http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm6.jpg you can check
out.

This is of my root window, which I've programmed to hourly download 2 weather
map graphics off the web.  A program called "fly" then creates a black
background and pastes these 2 gif images onto the background.  "display" then
places the new image on my root background.

The text you see across the top is done by creating an FvwmButton, setting the
pixmap to none and no title, which creates a transparent bar.  The bar swallows an
rxvt terminal, which is made transparent by modifying .xDefaults (see man rxvt).

I haven't tweaked this setup yet.  When I have the time I'm going to write a
script to run from the rxvt that will hourly download the current conditions for
my location.  At present what you see is from TkWeather, a program I downloaded
off Fresh Meat.  You have to manually request updates.

Hi,

I'm using fvwm2-2.2.4 and FvwmIconMan. I have some little questions.
Howto:

1) center the name in each box ?

2) mark the name of a window to reflect when it's iconified. For example
parenthesis as in WinList ? Or a different color ?

3) I tried fvwm-2.4.0, and with the same ~/.fvwm2rc file, the
FvwmIconMan have now a gray outline and a 3D push/depress effect that I
don't like. Where does it come from and how can I remove it ?

Here is my actual setting in ~/.fvwm2rc:

Module FvwmIconMan
Style FvwmIconMan NoTitle,NoHandles,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0,NoIcon,
CirculateSkip,Sticky
*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 1

Hello List,

It suddenly occured to me, while i was looking at your
homepage, that the site does not include a picture of
the "Fvwm-Workers: i.e. Dominik Vogt, Dan Espen, etc".


You have pictures of your cats (<grin>), why not have
one of each of you??

Just out of interest, how many of you (from the
workers team), have actually met, face to face???
