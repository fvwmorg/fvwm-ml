I use ROX, too.
You can see my screenshot at
http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ugk8/rox-fvwm.png

-----description-----

This screenshot shows FVWM 2.5.6 with ROX 2.0.1 and two gkrellms on the
right. The icons are available at kde-look.org and the FVWM-theme is made by
myself.

The good thing with ROX is, that you can have icons on your desktop
without loosing your root-menu.

That's a nice desktop.

Have you given idesk a try? i've recently re-discovered it, it lets you 
draw SVG icons on your root window and can look really effective.

Heres one of my screenshots (the terminal and xmms icon on the left).

Hello List,

is it possible to have transparent gradients?
If yes, how can I do that?

My goal is to make the title and borders of the inactive windows
transparent, but I want to keep the design of the active window.

Best regards
	Klaus Umbach

This is possible, something like:

  TitleStyle    AllInactive Colorset 1 -- flat
  AddTitleStyle AllInactive Colorset 2 30     # alpha == 30% here

  TitleStyle    AllActive   Colorset 2 -- raised

  BorderStyle                   -- UseTitleStyle
  ButtonStyle   All AllInactive -- UseTitleStyle flat
  ButtonStyle   All AllActive   -- UseTitleStyle raised

  Colorset 1 RootTransparent buffer, fg gray80, bg average
  Colorset 2 fg #301058, VGradient 40 #a17aa1 #714a71, bg average

  Style * Colorset 1, HilightColorset 2
  Style * BorderColorset 1, HilightBorderColorset 2

Seems to work well.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, that works fine, but that's not what I meant.
In your example the Colorset is completely transparent.
I want the transparent Colorset tinted with a gradient.

I want this to be semi-transparent.
Colorset 10 Vgradient 255 3 #aaaaaa 15 #888888 50 #aaaaaa 20 #888894, bg grey75, fg grey90, fg_alpha 90, fgsh Black

Sorry for my bad explanation in the last mail. :-)

Set this into the Colorset 2 line in my example above and it is done.
You may want to change the alpha value from 30 to 60 and change "raised"
to "flat".

Ehrm, yes. I guess you are trained in not misunderstanding questions.
:-)

OK, I got it now and it works how I wanted it, but there is still one
little problem. I have a frame inside my title, made with your PNGs, but
I don't want them in my buttons, where they appear when I set 
	BorderStyle -- UseTitleStyle
But when I don't do it, the Buttons don't use the background, but the
average color.

  AddTitleStyle InActive Pixmap t/title_left.png -- Flat Left
  AddTitleStyle InActive TiledPixmap t/title_top.png -- Flat Top
  AddTitleStyle Inactive Pixmap t/title_right.png -- Flat Right
  AddTitleStyle InActive TiledPixmap t/title_bottom.png -- Flat Bottom
	
Thats how I made the frame inside the title

and I made a picture:
http://doppelhertz.homelinux.org/screenshots/snipsnap.png

So, how can I remove the frame in the buttons?

best regards
	Klaus

Hi, i'm novice.
How to add the 3d button (close function) to the right side of the 
window, like in fwvm default setup.
In my setup everything is MWM* and i like this look.
But i like to have this button too.

TIA, Bob

actually I have got 5 Buttons on the right side. I'll copy paste the 
relevant parts of my configuration. I guess you'll figure out what you 
need.

put it all in your fvwm configuration file (probably something like 
~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc)

You mean "ButtonStyle" here.

Well, if you don't want titlebar buttons to enherit all title settings,
then don't use UseTitleStyle. Separately apply semi-transparency to
title and to buttons, like:

   TitleStyle         AllInactive Colorset 1 -- flat
   AddTitleStyle      AllInactive Colorset 2 60

   ButtonStyle    All AllInactive Colorset 1 -- flat
   AddButtonStyle All AllInactive Colorset 2 60

   ButtonStyle    All AllInactive -- !UseTitleStyle flat
   ButtonStyle    All AllActive   --  UseTitleStyle flat

If this does not help, then provide all relevant TitleStyle/ButtonStyle/
Colorset lines. Or better yet, convert your full configuration (or just
decorations) to fvwm-themes format, so I and hunderds of others may
trivially load your theme.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This sometimes happens in 2.4.x when a window dies at a very
unfortunate time.  Fvwm misses that event and leaves the blank
decorations on the desktop.  But the real problem is why the
window dies.  The fvwm frame proves that the window is opened, but
then closed immediately.  That usually happens when the xterm can
not find or run the program it is meant to serve.  Check your PATH
inside fvwm and the ssh setup.

Have you tried simply "+ xterm exec xterm" ?

How can I convert that? Is there a script?

Before I let anyone read my configuration, I have to clean it up a
little, before it gets awkward.

Hi all!

I have 2 monitors hooked up to Debian. Normally I
run Backstreet Ruby so 2 users can use the one
system both with fvwm on their own X (and keybd
and mouse)

But one alternative is to use Xinerama with Fvwm.
I have fvwm 2.4.16 from Debian that has Xinerama
support.

If I boot with the Xinerama Xserver layout, I get
fvwm on both screens. True enough the man page
says it will work "right out the box".

But I cannot get anything to happen on the left
screen. "Intuitively" (but my intuition is
backwards) I would say: move the mouse to the
left from the right screen and it appears on the
left screen and then you can do what you want there.

However, that doesn't happen, of course. Trying
lines 4210-14 from the man page that say:

XineramaSlsSize 2x1 
XineramaSlsOn 
XineramaPrimaryScreen 1 
XineramaOn 

gets:

[FVWM.0][execute_function]: <> No such command
'XineramaSlsOn' 
[FVWM.0][execute_function]: <> No such command
'XineramaOn' 

Similarly I thought:

EdgeScroll      0 0			
EdgeResistance  10000 10000 0

should move a window to the left monitor, but it
doesn't.

Can anyone provide me with a simple example of
one thing I can do in Xinerama, please?

Is my "intuition" feasible to move the mouse over?

Thanks!

Hugo

That appears to be a typo in the man page.

Try:

XineramaSls On
Xinerama On

You should convert by hand, of course. It is not hard. You start with one
.fvwm2rc file and end up with several files (fvwm-themes components).

There is a strict division to components, one command that belongs to one
component should never appear in another component. Some complex commands
(like TitleStyle) should be split between components, for example,
"TitleStyle Height MinHeight" and only this belongs to buttons component.
"TitleStyle LeftJustified -- flat" and only this belongs to "windowlook".
The rest of TitleStyle setting decoration colors/images belongs to "colors".

You may browse all existing themes in 0.6.2 or 0.7.0 (from cvs) to get an
idea of what commands should go to each component. Then go through your
.fvwm2rc, command by command, and place them to one or another component.

Another approach (probably better) is to start with an empty theme and
add complete components one by one, then test every new added component.
In the end you end up with your own theme that is easly distributable if
done correctly.

> little, before it gets awkward.

If you want to clean up your configuration anyway, it is better to start
with an empty theme "dualprinzip" and build it step by step. Start with
simple components "background", "menustyles", "globalfeel", "windowlook",
"buttons" and "colors". Just mimic exactly the way other themes are done.
After all these work, you may start to add modules. Ask if needed.
There is documentation, including FAQ.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am working fine with fvwm-2.5.7 for a week. There is
only a very minor problem that bothers me.

Please take a look at one of my screenshots first:
http://chaoith.no-ip.org:30002/shot-2.png

As you may have seen, Button 1 is in the same
foreground color as the title, which is extremely
difficult to see. What I really want is to override
the button 1 foreground color to something darker.
fvwm fails me. It is very likely that I configure the
wrong way.

Here is my fvwm2rc. Any comments are welcomed.

#Active Window
Colorset 2 bg #3e71aa, fg white

#Active button 1
Colorset 15 bg #e0e8f5, fg black

#Active titlebar
Colorset 21 HGradient 200 #e0e8f5 #728daa

Style * HilightColorset 2

AddToDecor DefaultDecor

+ TitleStyle Active (Colorset 21 -- flat) Inactive
(Colorset 22 -- flat)

+ ButtonStyle 1 Activeup (Colorset 15 -- flat)
Inactive (Colorset 17 -- flat)

#Using @2 because fvwm swaps @2 with @3, mystery.
#@2 represent the foreground color in this case.
+ AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x80@2 20x20@2 80x20@2
50x80@2


Thanks,

I have a question about ImagePath.  in the rc file do you need to put
with complete path for icons or will it check in every file folder of a
directory?

for instace I have an icon directory with several file folders

/usr/share/icons/ and this directory has a folder for each group of
icons

Thanks
Cat

I looked, but I didn't find anything that would do what I was
talking about.  I would like each menu option to have its own 3D
border, so each one looks like a button.  Is there a way to do
this already that I am missing?

Thanks,

Use the   +      !

If /usr/share/icons contains folder1, folder2, folder3 etc
then in .fvwm2rc use

ImagePath /usr/share/icons:+


You can then write
eg
Style "emacs" Icon folder1/emacs.xpm, etc
Style "gvim"   Icon folder2/vim.xpm, etc
Style "xmcd"  Icon folder3/cdrom.xpm, etc

In cvs, @2 represents bg not fg, as documented.

Try to replace this with:

AddButtonStyle 1 AllInactive Vector 4 50x80@2 20x20@2 80x20@2 50x80@2
AddButtonStyle 1 AllActive   Vector 4 50x80@0 20x20@0 80x20@0 50x80@0

It works. But the button foreground is in black. I
have to add another line:

#Active Window
Colorset 2 bg #3e71aa, fg white, sh #728daa

Style * HilightColorset 2

It is ok if I only want to change 1 button. What about
if I want to change 2 buttons? 3 buttons? 4 buttons?
It seems that there is no way to do it because I can
only specify 1 shadow color. It would be really nice
if the button colorset can override the default style
colorset.

Colorset 15 bg #e0e8f5, fg #728daa
+ ButtonStyle 1 Activeup (Colorset 15 -- flat)
Inactive (Colorset 17 -- flat)
AddButtonStyle 1 AllActive   Vector 4 50x80@3
 20x20@3 80x20@3 50x80@3

In this way, we are not constrained to only one shadow
color or one foreground color in "Style *".

Just a kind suggestion. ;)

Thanks.
Kevin L

Hi,

How can i select the right string for a font?
F.e.: I want the  Lucida Sans font, but  how can i figure  out the right
string?
grep -i 'Lucida Sans' in my  fonts.scale shows me some strings, but when
i try  to put them in  my fvwm2rc i just  get an error, which  says this
font can't be  found. Some strings are working, but i  don't know how to
change the textsize of these fonts.

Can you give me some tips?

tia,
schamil

Maybe. I.e. when ButtonStyle Colorset is specified without alpha, then it
fully replaces the base titlebar colorset for things like vector button
drawing. Only Olivier knows whether it is easy to apply this logic.

When started to reply, I thought that currently you may define 2
shadow/hilight sets of colors, one for right buttons and one for left
buttons using MultiPixmap (beware, it will be renamed to MultiPart, since
it works with colorsets not [just] pixmaps). But I tested, the situation
here is the same, the base titlebar colorset (Style * Colorset) is always
used for Vector buttons regardless of the fact other colorsets fully
override it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

My setup (from memory...)

Colorset 1 Transparent
Style FvwmPager Colorset 1, ParentalRelativity

I'm not sure, if you can freely use the colorset 1...


If someone could write a minimal setup to have shadows on the fonts...
thx

You're right.  Currently you get the 3d look only when the item
is hilighted.

Hi.

I'm using tcl/tk application FileRunner.
When i open a file with the internal viewer(editor) and then want to 
save the file, it opens a dialog window and push the viewer window 
behind the main fr window. When i close the save dialog, the viewer 
window stay behind the main fr window.
Another annoying thing. When fr runs internal application (ftp,copy) for 
a long time and i switch to another workspace, it opens dialog window in 
the current workspace and not in the main fr window workspace.
Is there any workaround?

TIA, Bob

Or probably better:

Search for "FONT SHADOW" in the man page.

How hard would it be to implement this as an option for normal
menus?  I think it would give a nice look.  I'd be happy to try
it myself, but I might need someone to give me an idea of what
needs to be changed.

It's quite some work because we don't have any item specific
options yet.  You'd have to add some menu styles for button
decorations and paint them into the menu background pixmap (the
foreground is too slow).  In addition, button specific
decorations have to force that the background pixmap is as big as
the menu itself.  Tiling H- and Vgradients isn't possible anymore.

OK, what about just adding an option that makes separators match
the button look (i.e. extend all the way across the menu and
match the button relief look)?  Then I could just put a separator
between each item.  Not perfect, but it might be doable.

Thanks for the explanation.

A transient window is a window an application creates that the application
sets the transient hint for.  See man page XSetTransientForHint.

Normally an application will set this hint for dialog windows that pop up
asking for confirmation, like "Click OK to continue, else Cancel".

But it would screw up all the menu size calculations.  I prefer a
clean patch to a hack.

Hello all,

I am trying to install the currrent stable fvwm release on a Sun Blade (OS5) machine to which I don't have SU access. I get through the ./configure --prefix=/home/allan, make, make install stages no problem. But... how do I then run the new installation rather than the standard one put there by su?

I can't run one window manager on top of another and when I login with fvwm it offers me only the old one in the sessions list...

Thanks
Allan

Run

  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/allan --exec-prefix=/home/allan

If necessary, edit your PATH variable to have $HOME/bin at the
front.  Put the fvwm call with the full path into your
~/.xinitrc file (or whatever your system uses).

Hi,

Thanks for your reply Dominik.

> $ ./configure --prefix=/home/allan --exec-prefix=/home/allan

>If necessary, edit your PATH variable to have $HOME/bin at the front.  Put the fvwm call with the full path into your ~/.xinitrc file (or whatever your system uses).

I am afriad I don't actually know what you mean by the 'fvwm call'. I have added 

exec /home/s9902456/bin/share/bin/fvwm2 

to the end of ~/.xinitrc which now looks something like:

if [ "$X_DISPLAY_IS_PC" = "yes" ]
then
	xrdb -DX_DISPLAY_IS_PC $HOME/.Xdefaults
else
	xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
fi
if [ "$NEWSSERVER" = "" ]; then
	xset -fp /usr/local/pack/X11/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/ > /dev/null 2>&1
	xset +fp /usr/local/pack/X11/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/ > /dev/null 2>&1
	xterm -C -T Console -n Console -sb -g 80x4+0-0 -iconic &
	
	if [ "$X_DISPLAY_IS_PC" = "yes" ]
	then
		xterm -T `hostname` -n `hostname`  -sb -g 80x22+0+0 &
	else
		xterm -T `hostname` -n `hostname`  -sb -g 80x34+0+0 &
	fi
else
	eval `svenv -env`
fi
# DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE - BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO
. /usr/local/DOT/XINITRC.EE3
exec /home/s9902456/bin/share/bin/fvwm2


Thanks for your help. It is much appreachated.
Allan

Is your ~/.xinitrc executed at all? Add some echo commands to verify
this. This file should be "chmod a+x". There are other initialization
files used by different display/session managers, like ~/.Xclients and
~/.xsession, add the exec line above to these files to see whether they
work. These files should be "chmod a+x" too.

In any case you may start the new fvwm temporarily by opening FvwmConsole
in the old fvwm and typing in it:

  Restart /home/allan/bin/fvwm

Or even, depending on how old is your old fvwm, run this shell command:

  % /home/allan/bin/fvwm -r

This replaces the existing WM if it understands the ICCCM2 procedure.
But beware, this last command may also quit your X with some setups.

If you still can't figure it out, I suggest you to ask your sysadmin to
help you with the X setup. Reading FAQ question 2.2 may help too.

P.S. Please always ask fvwm questions on the list, not privately.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is there any argument for "Style <application> argument" that the
matching application is ignored by the window-placement-rules of other
applications?
So that the other applications which pop up on the screen completely
ignore this application in its window-placement.

or 

Is there any Window-Placement-Style (like CleverPlacement,etc) which
totally ignores windows on lower layers in its placement-rules?

Thanks
Phil

From: Mrs Serena Jones
  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
       I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry =
Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he =
died in the year
2000.
    We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief =
illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his =
death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home =
which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the =
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one =
finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is =
still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would =
not last for the next three 
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke =
sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church =
or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I =
am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund =
churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  =
that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that =
Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don=92t want my =
husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don=92t want a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the =
reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know =
where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. =
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =
peace. I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of =
my health because of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me =
always. I don=92t want them to know about this development. With God all =
things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the =
contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also =
issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- =
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me =
because the lord is my shephard. My 
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to =
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =
for a chuch or christian individual for this  same purpose. Please assure me =
that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein.  Hoping to hearing from =
you. 
N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND =
IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND =
I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NUMBER =
IS 0031620668086.
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Serena Jones

 And I want the "Microsoft" key has the same function as  the above "F1" 
key has.
What should I do?

Thanks in advance.

Well I do it this way

In .xinitrc

8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------
# Keyboard tweaks
/usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e "keycode 116 = F31"
/usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e "keycode 117 = F32"
8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------

and in .fvwm2rc

8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------
Key F31         A       N      Scroll -100 +0
Key F32         A       N      Scroll +100 +0
8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------

So that I move backwards and forwards through workspaces

You won't actually see a button unless you bind an action
to the button.

Like:

Mouse 0 2 A  Delete

Dear fvwm users,

I have looked at many screenshots on the fvwm site (great stuff) looking 
for an example of windows with rounded corners - but was unable to find 
any.  Is it possible to generate windows with rounded corners?

Thanks in advance

No, unless such borders are provided by a shaped application itself.

Maybe looking for xp-style borders. Rectangular windows with rounded
borders. You really cannot figure it out?

Hi all,

I just purchased a 2nd monitor for my Matrox G550 video card. Now I've
got dual displays - cool!

Just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to configure FVWM
to make use of a dual setup? ie. I'm interested in finding out how
other FVWMers with dual displays setup their .fvwmrc.

SCoTTie! :)

Hi.

Weird behaviour of FileRunner under different WM.

When i open a file with the internal viewer (MB3 on the file name),
the new window properly stacks on the main fr window.
When i try to save this file (MB3 Save As...) the weirdness begin:

FileRunner-2.5.1-6 on both platforms.
tcltk-8.3.1-4 on Tru64
tcl-8.3.5-88 on RH9

CDE, Tru64, 5.1B:
MWM, Linux, RH9:
    open save dialog in edit window (MB3)
    edit window pushed behind the main
    save
    edit window pops back, O.K.

Linux, RH9
TWM XFree86-twm-4.3.0-2:
XFCE3 3.8.18:
XFCE4 4.0.0:
    open save dialog in edit window (MB3)
    edit window stays above main
    save
    edit window is not pushed behind the main window
    all the three windows visible all the time, O.K.

FVWM 2.5.7:  (this is the one i'm interested in)
GNOME 2.2.0.*:
KDE 3.1-*:
    open save dialog in edit window (MB3)
    edit window pushed behind the main
    save
    edit window stays behind hidden,
      or partly hidden, depends on the window position

Any solution?

All WM:
When fr runs internal application (ftp,copy) for a long time and i 
switch to another workspace, it opens dialog window in the current 
workspace and not in the workspace where the main window reside.

Is there any workaround?

TIA, Bob

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:

- Implemented autoResize option so all windows automatically resize to the
  dimensions of the largest window in the tabber.
- Mods to make FvwmTabs much more robust.

Note: This version requires a patch to X11-Protocol.
Existing users of FvwmTabs will need to download & apply a patch or,
alternatively, download a patched version of X11-Protocol & reinstall.
See the "Version History" section for v2.1 on the web site.

SCoTT. :)

In the 2.5.x versions, look for the ...PlacementPenalties styles.

That is because the dialog window is a transient for the main
window.  In many window managers, when a transient is raised, its
"parent" window is also raised.  The right fix is to make the
dialog a transient window of the qedit window, not of the main
window.  Please report this to the FileRunner developers.  It is
not the fault of the window managers.

In fvwm, you can disable this automatic raising/lowering:

  Style FileRunner !StackTransientParent

(or DontStackTransientParent with fvwm-2.5.3 or earlier).

In fvwm, you can force all FileRunner windows on a specific desk
or page:

  Style FileRunner StartsOnPage 1 1, Skipmapping

(or try one of the other StartsOn... styles).  This works only if
you start FileRunner always on the same page or desk.

Could anybody tell me if there's a way to suppress icon images so
that icons are just labels. I'm using Icon path-to-non-existent-file
but this doesn't work for applications that supply their own icon.

(Please Cc: me as I'm not on the list.)

Remove all "Icon" style lines from your config file and add

  Style ** Icon

instead.

hello all, 

I was trying to write a script that allowed me to select different mp3's
off a menu, but I'm having trouble with some of the songs, which contain a
single quote as an apostrophe as part of their name.  Is there a way to
tell FVWM to not try and find said quote's partner?  Any help would be
appreciated.

According to the man page, you can escape quotes with the backslash.
So, perhaps:

Exec mplayer X\'s.mp3

If that doesn't help, give us more details.

Add:

  | sed "s/'/\\\\'/g"

to the end of your PipeRead. You may need to experiment with the number
of backslashes. Another solution is to put your filenames in double
quotes or backticks if you know the filenames don't have these chars.

Regards,
Mikhael.

	This sounds like a good place to jump in.
	I'm upgrading from fvwm 1.24 and I've figured most of how to
make 2.5.x behave like the old installation.
	One bit I do not understand: the old version put an entry in
the iconbox whether the window was iconified or not.  One click
iconified the window; the following click brought it back at the
same position within the current pager space.
	I'd like to ge that behavior back.

Hello. I was missing some functionality (specifically saving the position
and size of windows) so I started to develop a module. The problem is that
I don't like C very much, so I tried to do it in c++, after hacking some
scripts and headers, which caused some compilation and linking errors.

So, my question is: is it worth the effort to try to make some sort of
c++-interface to the modules? I was thinking of doing it in that case, but
I ask of your opinions first since I'm not really into the code yet.
Because I believe that my problems could be solved this way, and also, it
could be a nice project :)

Additionally, in the configure-scripts I read that: "Actually, we don't
use it (c++) at _all_ anymore, since the only module that used it has been
removed.  It causes problems so we'll comment it out for now.  Hopefully
by the time we need it again autoconf will handle it better :-/ "
What are these problems? Is my project doomed, or could it be solved?

/Tomas

Why is it impossible to execute reboot giving you have root permissions?

If you only want a delay for external shell commands then this will do it:

  Exec sleep 300; reboot

BTW, shutdown has -t parameter for this. But sleep works for other
shell commands.

In 2.5.x you may postpone any fvwm command, say in 180 seconds:

  Schedule 180000 Quit

  Schedule 180000 Exec exec something

See also Deschedule.

Mikhael.

If I understand your question, you are using FvwmIconBox and
its the part about bringing the
window back on the current page that is missing.

I don't have an answer, I'm just trying to clarify what you want.

As I remember, C++ worked, it was that the module wasn't worth the
extra portability issues.

I'd guess Perl would be the best language for a module like this.

You should know the internals pretty well to consider to do such project.
You should also learn perllib thorouhly, because you will want to reuse
its class design (if you dislike C function approach). At this point, you
probably decide just to stick with Perl, because you will not be able to
find C++ equivalents for many elegant Perl solutions. In this regard, C++
is not much different from C.

Dan already answered, but I may add some bits.

You may see how FvwmKb (use Google) solved this. I think it has its own
Makefile.

If you describe exactly what do you need to do in your module, it is
possible there is a solution without additional modules.

Mikhael.

I guess you're right, maybe I should consider Perl instead of digging to
deep into the internals just to get to use my favourite language.

Thanks

The thing is that I would like to select windows and choosing "Save
position/size" or something from a menu (or whatever), to save theyre
state in some kind of file. Next time the window opens, the window is
resized/moved to the saved state. I use FvwmEvent for this right now (with
inspiration from the FAQ), but I have to put all the window-names in the
fvwm config-file, I would like to simplify this a bit.

It is not much longer to write a Perl module, but let's do it without it.

  DestroyFunc RestoreWindowGeometry
  AddToFunc   RestoreWindowGeometry
  Read saved-window-geometries Quiet

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-NewWindow: *
  *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window RestoreWindowGeometry

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow

  DestroyFunc SaveWindowGeometry
  AddToFunc   SaveWindowGeometry
  + I AddToFunc RestoreWindowGeometry
  + I + I ThisWindow ('$0') ResizeMove $1 $2 $3 $4
  + I Exec echo "+ I ThisWindow ('$0') ResizeMove $1 $2 $3 $4" >>$[FVWM_USERDIR]/saved-window-geometries

  Key F4 A CS Pick SaveWindowGeometry $[w.name] $[w.x] $[w.y] $[w.width] $[w.height]

Not tested, but it should work, I think. Press Ctrl-Shift-F4 to save the
current window geometry, it is restored automatically on the next launch.

To remove the old windows with the same name you may do something like:
Exec grep -v "ThisWindow ('$0')" file >file.new && mv file.new file; echo ..

This supposes window names do not include double quotes. To make it more
robust, write a module in Perl rather than relying on Exec+shell quotes
to work. If you ask me nicely I may write a Perl module for you doing
the same. But I don't really want to spoil your fun. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

	Let me rephrase:
	In v1 it was possible to move a window cleanly from one page to
another by iconifying it (clicking the entry in the iconbox), moving
to the target page, and deiconifying.  This was also useful in
momentarily reducing screen clutter so that one could, for example,
find and dismiss a transient. 
	I'm not wedded to a specific implementation, but would really
like that functionality (or something close to it) back.

This was answered several times on the mailing list.

Suppose this snippet from fvwm-themes:

  *FvwmIconBox: Mouse 1  Click       FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  *FvwmIconBox: Mouse 1  DoubleClick FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndWarp
  *FvwmIconBox: Mouse 2  Click       Iconify
  *FvwmIconBox: Mouse 2  DoubleClick Iconify

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndRaise
  + I Iconify off
  + I Focus
  + I Raise

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndWarp
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmDeiconifyFocusAndWarp
  + I Iconify off
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow 10p 10p

If you for some reason want the window to be deiconified on the current
page then add "+ I MoveToPage" at the beggining of these functions.

You may also use:

  Style * StickyIcon

Hi,
I have a little problem.
When I push mouse on any of title bar buttons the buttons are executing 
a command even I move the mouse cursor behind the button and release the 
button.
How to solve this?
Thank you for the help.

Use a function instead of an immediate command. And in the function use
"C" to execute a command, not "I". Then it will work like you want.

You may create really interesting button feels. For example, in
fvwm-themes all dangerous operations are canceled when you drag
a button after the accident press. Or when you simply wait (hold).
Even if the cursor does not leave the button area.

Like in this small snippet:

  #     button    context modifie function
  Mouse 0         2       A       FuncFvwmDeleteOrDestroy
  Mouse 1         4       A       FuncFvwmMaximize
  Mouse 1         6       A       FuncFvwmIconify
  
  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmDeleteOrDestroy
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmDeleteOrDestroy
  + H Nop
  + M Nop
  + C Delete
  + D Destroy

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximize
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximize
  + M Nop
  + H Nop
  + C Maximize
  + D Menu MenuFvwmWindowMaximize

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmIconify
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmIconify
  + C Iconify

You need only "C" to cover your question, but having additional canceling
mechanisms (Nop on Move and Hold) may be useful too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Wow, thanks! That'll do for now. But I think I need to improve my
Perl-skills sometime, so it seems like a nice project to try when I have
the time.

Hi,
Thank You very much for the previous answers.
I have a little problem with my middle mouse button.
I have bind the button with WindowList, but when I release the middle
mouse button the WindowList is turned into a window with titlebar.
I'm using such command to bind the mouse button:
Mouse 2 A A WindowList
Regards.

First, "Mouse 2 A A" is a pretty bad binding, you will not be able to use
the middle button in any application completely. Try:

  Mouse 2 A A -    # restore middle button in applications
  Mouse 2 A SM WindowList  # Shift=Alt-middle button anywhere
  Mouse 2 R A  WindowList  # middle button in the root

Second, I am afraid you should buy a new mice, since its middle button
sends duplicate clicks.

Regards,
Mikhael.

If you invoke a menu with a title with button 2,
the slightest bit of movement in the title before releasing
will paste the menu.

If you want to dismiss the menu without selecting something
you have to move the mouse outside the menu.

This never works when a function is bound. With either "I" or "C".

Hi,

is there any possibility to save the location of a window? So when
i start my X with fvwm, the gaim window (for example) will always
be placed at left bottom corner and when i move it to the right top
corner it should stay there after restarting X.

any hints?

ciao,
schamil

There are FvwmSave and FvwmSaveDesk modules, but it is not suggested to
use them, they are likely to be deleted.

Use session managers like xsm, gnome-session or ksmserver.
They are specially designed to do this work.

I am developing an application using Qt and one of my windows insists on
resizing itself smaller than what it should be.  If I use Qt's adjustSize()
method I can see the window being painted at its larger size and then it gets
resized smaller.  At first I thought I had a bug with Qt but then I started
thinking it might be fvwm.  Sure enough, under CDE I do not have this
problem.  

Why would fvwm be sending a resize even to my window?  What can I do about
it?

Thanks!

I don't have any experience with Qt apps, but in the past Fvwm has
had problems because it pays attention to the program's size hints.

Try running:

xwininfo -size

click on the window with the problem.
Post the results.

xwininfo: Window id: 0x6800801 "USD AAA Credit Default Curve"

  Normal window size hints:
      User supplied size: 944 by 623
      Program supplied size: 944 by 623
      Program supplied minimum size: 458 by 277
      Program supplied window gravity: NorthWestGravity
  No zoom window size hints defined

FWIW the size I'm expecting is 944 x 623 (the User supplied size) and the
size I am getting (as given by "Identify" from the window's system menu)
shows 458 x 623.

Does this tell you anything?

Hello,
Is there a way to disable "static" menu when I push the mouse button?
I would like to see the menu only when the mouse button is pressed.
Sometimes when I'm not moving the mouse cursor menu stays on top even I 
release the button.
Thank you for the answer.

If I understand you correctly, you want to use "Popup menuname" command
instead of "Menu menuname" command.

It is hard to say without running the application.

You may experiment with these style options:

  FixedUSSize / VariableUSSize
  FixedPSize / VariablePSize
  FixedSize / VariableSize

For example:

  Style "USD AAA *" FixedUSSize

Mikhael.

Dear Sir,
My names are  Mac  Johnson  Bonida, I am the inmediate
young brother to Mrs Jewel Charles Taylor of  war
tored country of Liberia-westAfrica, the wife of (Mr
Charles Taylor) president of Liberia.
After a peace deal in Ghana few weeks ago, my sister
called me for introduction of what need to be done
inmediately that her properties are no longer safe. He
asked me to meet her contact in Ivory Coast to arrange
my journey to Eruope. She said  that she had made
contact with a  Security company to move a truck box
containing $30,000,000.00 US Dollars,  Thirty  Million
United State Dollars Only, and that the security
company label the box which the funds are contained in
as a box containing Africa artifacts.
The Company has confirmed the arrival of  this
consignment in their  office in Netherlands.
I left for Ivory-Coast  for my journey to Europe and
at this moment I am in Netherlands but owing to what
is happening in my country this time, my sister can
not do nothing as to Claim the Consignment and she
want this deal to be a confidential transaction, so
she asked me to contact any partner  who could stand
as a beneficiary of this truck box, so that after the
beneficiary must have claimed the box the money will
be channeled into good business investments with low
risk.
She has agreed to give 10% of the total fund to you
for assistance and moving of the fund to your private
account in your country for the purpose of the
investment. While 5% of the total fund will cover your
expense during this transaction, and another 5% for
me. You can contact me if you are interested by my
e-mail address or kindly call me on this Netherlands
telephone number, .
I would be glad if you can help me out to complete
this transcation and transfer this fund into your
private account. Please endeavour to keep this
transaction as confidentail as much as possible
because my Sister and her husband is in trouble over
the war in my country-Liberia.
Your Sincerelly,
Mac Jonson Bonida

Hello,
Not exactly - I want simple menu (like root menu) that will not 
disappear when I choose some sub-menu.
The menu should disappear immediately when I release the mouse button.
For now this is done only when I'm moving the mouse button.
I'm invoking the menu this way:

Mouse 3 A M Menu MenuRoot
DestroyMenu MenuRoot
AddToMenu MenuRoot
+ "abc" Popup MenuAbc

Regards

It does what you explain.

Did you actually try "Popup menuname"?  It does exactly what you
describe (with the exception that the sub menu becomes 'posted'
because of the click).

This can be, I am afraid, a generic problem with any of my windows.  How do I
specify this style for all windows?  Based on what xwininfo is showing, why
won't fvwm simply honor the user specified size that I've asked for?

  Style * ...

But you do not want to do this for all windows.  Use FvwmIdent to
find out a better pattern for all windows of this application.

That's hard to say without analysing the situation.  The
application does something that causes fvwm to limit the window
size.  It may request that size on its own, request a maximum
window size smaller than the minimum size, or ask for a size
increment step width/height that is so big that fvwm rounds down
to the minimum window size.  Do you get any warnings from fvwm on
the X console related to this problem?

In my previous configuration I have used the "Popup" command, but I 
forgot to use "Nop" instruction at the end.
My root menu is disappearing now, sience I'm using "Popup RootMenu Nop" 
instead "Menu RootMenu", but when I move the mouse cursor in the root 
menu area and release it, the menu want not dissapear.
Thank you for any suggestions.

How do I "analyze the situation"?  The size I am asking for is larger than
the size I am getting, and it is a size that should fit without a problem.  I
am not getting any warnings on the console.  I am examining events that
arrive at my window (from a Qt perspective) and something is clearly sending
me a resize event - after I have specified the size I am looking for.

What can I do to help debug why this is happening?

I apologize for following up on my own posting but...

Using fvwm 2.2.2 I do NOT have this problem.

Attached in my old .fvwm2rc file.  Maybe there is something in this file that
needs to be done in an equivalent way for newer versions of fvwm?

Hello,
I have a 4x4 virtual desktop, and 5 desk on my FVWM. So in my fvwmrc, it'=
s=20
something like:

DeskTopSize 4x4
=2E..
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 4

So in total I have 4x4x5=3D80 virtual desktops.

What I want is to have my email apps (KMail) to stay on virtual desktop 3=
=20
only, but in all desk. What is the correct 'Style' option?

For example, if I use this style:
Style "gkrellm"   NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth=
 0,=20
CirculateSkip

this will make 'gkrellm' appears in all virtual desktops, all desks. That=
 is=20
*not* what I want, since I only want Kmail to appear on certain virtual=20
desktops, all desks.
Can this be accomplished?

I'm using lastest stable fvwm-2.4.x. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

What you call "virtual desktops" is called "virtual pages" in fvwm.

This is not possible in fvwm-2.4.x. In the developement versions use:

  Style KMail StickyAcrossDesks, StartsOnPage 2 0, SkipMapping

You may only make a window sticky on one or all pages across all desks,
not on some pages.

Regards,
Mikhael.

"Popup RootMenu Nop" is equivalent to "Popup RootMenu".

When you move the cursor into a submenu (i.e. when you effectivelly click
on it) it gets posted like Dominik mentioned, there are several ways to
unpost a submenu. If you don't want a submenu to be posted, just don't
click on it.

When you move the cursor into an item (i.e. when you effectivelly click
on it) the item action gets executed.

This is all intended. To cancel a Popup menu move the cursor outside of
the menu (or point it to the menu title) and release the mouse button.
Or press Escape.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I always thought being able to do that would be cool, is there some
technical reason behind that such feature doesn't exists?

I recently upgraded my workstation (SunBlade 1000) to Solaris 9.
The Solaris companion cd actually has fvwm 2.4.3 available as a
installable window manager so I don't have to go thru the usual
hacks to let me use fvwm which is very nice. I previously had
been running 2.0.46 on Solaris 8 with no problems.

One I upgraded I noticed a bunch of problems, windows not refreshing,
pager disappearing, etc. So I first tried building 2.4.3 myself with
less compiler optimization. Same behavior. So I got a copy of 2.4.16,
same behavior. So then I got 2.3.33, same behavior. Before I go back
and try moldy old 2.0.46 I thought I'd try here. I searched the mail
archives back 6monthos or so and found nothing seemingly relevant.
I also tried the bug database. Since some my version of fvwm mess up
I suspect this is really a solaris issue and not fvwm but I'm not
sure what to look for.

Here is my setup:

Solaris 9 update 4, Sunblade 1000, double headed.

With fvwm 2.4.x I see the following strange behavior:

  1: fvwm pager eventually disappears. It core dumps with following
     traceback:

  [1] XTextWidth(0x780018, 0x37bf8, 0x6, 0x7efefeff, 0x81010100, 0xff00), at 0xff231e00 
  [2] DrawGrid(desk = 2, erase = 1), line 1510 in "x_pager.c"
  [3] list_new_desk(body = 0x7), line 944 in "FvwmPager.c"
  [4] process_message(packet = 0x36958), line 510 in "FvwmPager.c"
  [5] My_XNextEvent(dpy = (nil), event = 0xffbffb40), line 1366 in "FvwmPager.c"
  [6] Loop(fd = 0x36400), line 459 in "FvwmPager.c"
  [7] main(argc = 225280, argv = 0xa), line 436 in "FvwmPager.c"

  2: Usually once the pager disappears a window used for confirmation with exmh (the
     What Now? window) which is set for StaysOnTop suddenly decides that Top is Bottom
     and always send the window to the back.

  3: I finally noticed that windows never seem to disappear from the Window-List. By
     now I have a whole lot of windows in the window list! I've wondered if this might
     somehow be the cause of symptom #1.

I don't think you are the only one with this problem.
(The refresh problem.)

There's a thread on comp.unix.solaris right now with someone
else with a similar issue, not involving Fvwm.

The posters keep saying, apply all the latest patches, but
last time I checked, all the patches were applied and
it still didn't work.

I think something is broken in the Solaris 9 X server.
Hmm, just noticed your Sun email address.

The Style and FvwmWindow internal structures have fixed size.
They are already pretty large currently.

With such feature the size would grow infinitely, because there are
theoretically endless (page_nx, page_ny) pairs to be configured per
window. FYI, Sticky, StickyAcrossPages and StickyAcrossDesks are just
3 bits per window (not even bytes).

Most of the window information is transfered to modules like FvwmPager,
(currently about 100 bytes per window on ADD_WINDOW/CONFIGURE_WINDOW)
making the situation even worse when adding such features.

Of course everything is solvable, for example it is possible to limit the
number of sticky pages to 10 per window, but it probably does not worth
it. This would add about 80 bytes of overhead per window even if you
don't use this feature.

Actually there are more problems with this feature, like very unusual
syntax/parsing, not well defined behaviour when DesktopSize is changed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Apart from Mikhael's technical explanation - no, there is no real
reason.  Except that it is because nobody has got around coding
such a feature that would involve managing lists of desks/pages on
which the window is visible.

Hi all,

Is there a way to get snapping to other windows while resizing a window?

Hello,

I have a program which creates transient windows, and I'm running into
a bit of a problem with it.  At times the program will create more
than one transient window.  The later transient window will obscure the
previous one, and there seems to be no way to bring the older transient
window into the foreground.  

Are there style options I can use for this program which will allow the
older transient to be brought to the foreground when that window is clicked?  
The program is using the following Style settings:

Style Ensite3000        Title,NoHandles,MWMBorder,BorderWidth 7,DecorateTransient


I've tried adding MouseFocusClickRaises and ClickToFocusRaises, but neither
helped.



Thank You,

Hi,
I have asked a man that know FVWM very good why when I click on a menu 
topic with middle mouse button the menu is opened as single window.
He said that this is because built in FVWM functions and there is only 
one way to change that - I must modify the FVWM source code - is it right?
Regards.

Yes, that's right.

If the middle button is tearing off the menu, you must be
using a 2.5.x beta release.

Remove the logic around line 4659 in fvwm/menus.c to disable
tear off menus on button 2.

However, the issue is not decided yet.  This particular binding
will probably be removed before the next stable release.

Try the styles !RaiseTransient, !LowerTransient or
!StackTransientParent.

(Replace the '!' with "Dont" for fvwm-2.5.3 or earlier).

Hi, all
I'm a newbie to FVWM. In order to get a screen shot, I add this line into 
.fvwm2rc :

Key F5   A    M    Exec import -window root shot.png

But it doesn't work when the Menus appear, i.e, I can't catch the looking of
any Menu in the shot.png.

Thanks.

Global bindings do not work in the menus. Menus have their own hardcodeed
bindings.

You can do this:

  Key F5   A    M    Exec sleep 15; import -window root shot.png

Then you have 15 seconds to open any menus you want.

Mikhael.

Can fvwm be set up so that the DeskTop covers two displays, so that one may
use it to move windows from one display to the other?

Many thanks,

Hi Tobias,

: the current tabsize is always resized to a minimum
: of the possible titlewidth while the others are maximazed. It
: would be much better if every tab has equal width !

At the moment the tab-button for the visible tab is resized to
allow the title text to be fully visible & the remaining space is
shared equally between the remaining tab-buttons for the non-visible
windows.

Earlier versions of FvwmTabs used to share space equally among
ALL the tab-buttons (I think this is what you are asking for?)
which works fine if you only have a few tabs & the title text is
not very long. However if you use many tabs &/or long title text
(much more common) this quickly becomes a problem as you can't
see all the title text for the visible tab.

Hence the current arrangement which deliberately tries to solve
this problem.

I don't see any advantages in using the earlier arrangement - you
don't really *gain* anything. Aesthetics perhaps? Am I misunderstanding
something?

: It is
: then possible to easyly see which tab is currently used and
: therefore the tabs can be switched faster.

Color & tab-button relief are the best ways to see which tab is visible.

Anyway, consider what's described above & tell me if you *really*
need this feature. If you do I can add it in as an option.

What do other FvwmTabs users think about this issue? agree? disagree?

SCoTT. :)

Ok, I said before that I planned to develop a module for saving of
window-position/size, so here we go. My Perl skills are not the best so if
you are interested, feel free to improve the code or make comments on it.

The module (FvwmSaveWindow) is found under the fvwm-section on my website:

Hi everyone,

is it still possible to use fvwm as the window manager for
GNOME? I followed the instructions in the FAQ, but it seems
that GNOME no longer allows users to select a window
manager of their choice. Does this mean I have to use the
default metacity wm, or not use GNOME at
all?

Thanks,
Ralph

Just open an xterm and issue this command...

fvwm -r -f .fvwm2rc &

...assuming you have a recent fvwm version with the -replace option
included, and assuming you have a .fvwm2rc config file. You may see some
messages like "Another window manager is running....etc..." but this is
normal. If you close the xterm however then fvwm will exit as well. Just
use the gnome session manager gui to save the session and gnome _should_
remember to restart fvwm the next time you login.

Starting fvwm without a config file is ok too as the default root menu
will give you options to create configs for you. Alternatively go to
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net for a nice user-friendly
configuration and start fvwm with "fvwm -r -f themes-rc" command
instead.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the help Dominik.  The combination of RaiseTransient and 
DontStackTransientParent was what worked for me.

I thought I may have seen this question before but can't locate in the
archives.

Is it possible to use a tiled pixmap or png image for FvwmTaskBar
background?  Would I need to set up a colorset in FvwmTheme first?  I
want something similar to how it is done in WindowBlinds (yea, I know it
is the product made by Stardock to make Windows look cool)



Thanks
Catherine

I took a short look (without running) at
  http://radikal.ath.cx/software/files/FvwmSaveWindow

I can't say you don't know Perl if you wrote such module in several days.
The module as it is now may probably be named FvwmMemorizeGeometry or so.

Some small notes that are hopefully intended to simplify your module.

1) You may use General::FileSystem to load/save/append file in one go.
You may probably also keep the whole config in memory (in hash) instead
of always loading/saving it from/to file.

2) You may use a single ResizeMove command to simplyify the module logic;
with "keep" arguments it may simulate both Move and Resize.

3) You may use ModuleConfig tracker to get the module configuration.

4) If you replace "Debug => $debugging," with "Debug => \$debugging,"
then this will also automagically work if you uncomment EnableOptions.

5) I see you (and Scott too) use this form to operate on a window:

  $module->send("WindowId $winId Move ...");

It is better (and a bit faster) to immediately define a window context:

  $module->send("Move ...", $winId);

6) You may omit the explicit module mask in the constructor if you wish,
but only in cvs versions.

7) In the future I hope that WindowList tracker (the only non functional
yet) will save you dozens of lines in your module. Of course it is pretty
difficult to come up with a perfect WindowList API that makes easier the
work on such completely different modules like FvwmWindowMenu, FvwmTabs
and FvwmSaveWindow, but I am working on this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes, you should use colorsets. Use this syntax in recent 2.4.x and 2.5.x:

  Colorset 10 TiledPixmap image.xpm, bg average, fg white
  *FvwmTaskBar: Colorset 10

In 2.4.x (only) you should also add line "ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme"
before colorset definitions.

This does not say anything to me.

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:
- Fixed annoying focusing race condition. (FvwmTabs would often steal
  focus when mouse was merely passing over a tab-manager to another window.)
- Bugfix: invoking NextTab/PrevTab in an empty tab-manager caused crash.
- Make FvwmTabs work with older versions of Perl.
- Created man page for FvwmTabs.
- Updates to fvwmtabrc file.

SCoTT. :)

Yes and i think thats the problem with me. I dont have any meaningfull
long names in the Title right now (only "bash") and according to
your procedure has the currently used tab the smallest width ! 
Using TabNext and TabPrev is then very confusing !!

eg.

Fvwm| BASH | bash      | bash           | bash            |
       ^ currently used

TabNext:
Fvwm| bash      | BASH | bash            | bash            |

TabNext:
Fvwm| bash      | bash            | BASH | bash            |

Just try it with some very short Titles.


--------------

I also tried the current behavior with longer titles and think
its running fine as long as the titles have nearly equal length. But
if some tab is very small, its again very confusing 
(i have tried a very long name (>50 letters)).

----------------

In generell i am not interested in what title the xterm has.
Instead i am only interested in what Xterm from the left i am in.
eg. .include file is in "leftmost(first)" Tab.
    .c file in second leftmost tab
    make(shell) in third
    <.. next files..>

And if i have many tabs in one manager i can also look at the
"status line"(directly below the Tabs) and see the corresponding
long title.

The currently tab-width procedure is confusing when used with short 
titles. (see above.)

[ Perhaps its only confusing for me. But try it yourself. ]

It would be fine for me, if all the tabs do have equal length
(like fluxbox).

I would be very gratefull for that feature. :-)

As far as you know i tried to patch on my one, but my perl knowledge is
limited.

Hi Scott

I am using the autoSwallow* Feature of FvwmTabs.
It would be fine if there is an option that tells 
FvwmTabs to only swallow programs of the Desktop/Page
the TabManager is in. That means if there is no
TabManager in current Desktop, then dont swallow it.

My current setting is:
*FvwmTabs: autoSwallowResource aterm 0
Normaly i do start bash-xterms via rootmenu.

Perhaps there is a way to mimic this behavior by
using a workaround. Any ideas ?
( Perhaps by setting a resorce according to the desktop
i am in ?)

Hi Tobias,

> In generell i am not interested in what title the xterm has.

Ok, I will add an option to force equal-width tab-buttons. I will
call this option "tobiasTabs"! Just kidding! :) I'll use "equalWidthTabs"
or something.

The Ctrl-Alt-number key-bindings are the fastest way to switch
b/w tabs. ie. Ctrl-Alt-0 will select/display the first tab.

Yep, that is a good idea. I've had a couple of other similar requests
to enhance the auto-swallow feature. I'll probably look at it after
Mikhael finishes the WindowList tracker.

The FvwmTabs(1) man page lists a few other things on my TODO list.

Hi all,

The FVWM function 'ExitFunction' is invoked prior to FVWM restarting
or exiting (the user logs out).

Is there a function that is _only_ invoked prior to FVWM restarting?

I regulary use more than 4 *terms and therefore have to use more than 
4 special bindings. Thats why i use the Priv- and NextTab function instead.



Thanks again

What is ModuleConfig tracker anyway, and what is the difference between
this and EnableOptions? Are they two different ways of doing the same
thing, in that case what's best?

I got this tip because my window borders are so small I can't grab 'em
with the mouse. The configuration below lets the user resize (or move) a
window by clicking inside the window with a modifier (in this case
Meta/Alt).
My problem is that the move/resize-interaction starts when I release the
mouse button, not immideatly when I click, which is not what I want.

Mouse 1     W   M   Move
Mouse 3     W   M   Resize


I have the same problem because I want to move windows by right clicking
the window buttons:
Mouse 3     12468   A     Move

The line above worked as I expected before I changed to Fvwm 2.5.7, I
don't remember exactly which version I had before, but I think it was
2.5.[4-6] something.

Strange, this is not working either:
Mouse 1  T  A  Move

There must be something wrong with my configuration...
If anyone have hints, please tell me, but I think I should look over my
(totally home-made) config a bit too.

I started off with fvwm95 and kept some of the features over the years
when I upgraded.  One of these was the little-used Start button...except I
renamed mine "Slut" um...because I could.
There's a screenshot and a copy of my rc file on the fvwm.org web site, if
you're interested.
I think the part you're missing is this:

*FvwmTaskBarStartName Slut
*FvwmTaskBarStartMenu Slut

Or, well...you get the idea. I hope.

Sorry about the spamming, just want to clarify a bit.
Ok, now I have tested and read a bit, it seems my config is ok. And I
found this in the todo-list:
-------
  D.2 Leave or remove the current change to triggering bindings on button
press
      or release?  Seems to irritate a lot of users, but fixes a root
window
      binding bug.
      [dv: added on 29-Mar-2003]
-------

It must be related to my problem, right? In that case, I will stop
bitching :)


Anyway I solved it temporarily by making a function which moves/resizes
the window, and bound it to the mouse-button:

Mouse 3     W   M   Function ResizeWindow
DestroyFunc ResizeWindow
AddToFunc ResizeWindow
+ "M" Resize

/Tomas

You may use either FvwmButtons or FvwmTaskBar modules, the second has the
Start button support built in, see the man pages.

Here is the line that gives you the good menu position in 2.5.x
for the task bar configured at the bottom:

  *FvwmTaskBar: StartCommand Popup FvwmMenuRoot rectangle $widthx$height+$left+$top -5p -100m

In fvwm-2.5.7 use this:

  AddToFunc ExitFunction
  + I Test (ToRestart) do-something-before-restart
  + I Test (Quit) do-something-before-quit

RestartFunction and InitFunction are pretty obsolete now. All you need is
StartFunction:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Test (Restart) do-something-on-restart
  + I do-something
  + I Test (Init) do-something-on-start

These are pretty independent things, ModuleConfig tracker (see perllib
documentation) automatically gives you all "*YourModule: name value"
configuration, statical and dynamical.

EnableOptions gives you command line options, like --verbose --desk 2.
See FvwmPager or other modules that use both, options and module config.

Usually, the user preferences are defined using module configuration
and the things that may be different for different module instances are
passed as command line options.

Mikhael.

I do not currently use FvwmTabs, but I would dislike such bindings.
Our keyboard has "1"/"F1" as the first number.

I would use 1 2 3 4 5... to identify tabs. And 0 means switch to the
last tab used (then 0 may be used to switch between any two tabs).

FYI, it may be a bit problematic for someone with fvwm-themes to use
exactly these bindings, since Ctrl-Alt-1 to Ctrl-Alt-4 are used there to
switch between desks, and Ctrl-Alt-0 to switch to the previously used
desk. There is a similar idea for switching between pages using keypad.

Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael,

: I do not currently use FvwmTabs, but I would dislike such bindings.
: Our keyboard has "1"/"F1" as the first number.

All the key-bindings for FvwmTabs are configurable with the standard
FVWM "Key" command.

: I would use 1 2 3 4 5... to identify tabs. And 0 means switch to the
: last tab used (then 0 may be used to switch between any two tabs).

An option to display the last tab is a good idea. I will add it soon.

: FYI, it may be a bit problematic for someone with fvwm-themes to use

Thanks, I wasn't aware of this. The key-bindings are configurable &
can be easily changed. The fvwmtabrc file on the website is actually
the one I use (ie. it's my settings). Do you think I should provide
a modified version of the fvwmtabrc file that has bindings less
likely to clash with other FVWM users?

Approximately what percentage of FVWM users use fvwm-themes anyway?
(It's infinitely larger than the percentage of FvwmTabs users I'm sure! :)

SCoTT. :)

Since posting this I've done some more experiments. There had been some suggestion
that the problems noted above were due to problems in the Solaris X server. I could
buy that but I did some more experiments. I went back and I rebuilt 2.0.46 which I
had been running with no problems on Solaris 8 and switched to it. All of the problems
mentioned above have gone away and I've seen no bad behavior. So while it doesn't
exonerate the Solaris 9 X server it must surely be some clues. My next thought
was that maybe this was triggered by some different configuration issue. Unfortunately
the configuration between 2.0.46 and 2.4.x is so drastically different that a
simple comparison doesn't seem productive. However I thought that maybe with the
knowledge that 2.0.46 works properly and the symptoms above (especially #3) that
maybe someone could give me a pointer as to what I could look and while trying
to debug it since I'd like to use 2.4.x if I could.

I don't have 2.0.46 handy, but I do have 1.24r.
In that version there is no call to XTextWidth.

If you want to debug this, create a test program with a call to
XTextWidth.  Use the logic in FvwmPager as a guide.
If you can get a test program to fail, you might have a chance
of convincing Sun there X server is broken or you might uncover
something in Fvwm.

When starting fvwm, the .fvwmrc in my home directory doesn't 
seem to get used.  I'm using RedHat, and the faq says
something about AnotherLevel and TheNextLevel, but neither
seem to be installed.

Anyway, I would like to have several Desks each with a 2x2 
Desktop (I think I have the terminology right), similar to
what is at the top of the www.fvwm.org web page.  I've 
searched the faq and mail archives, but am not sure what I was 
supposed to be looking for, hence this mail.

Versions of stuff:

fvwm-2.4.15-1
fvwm-themes-0.6.2-1
fvwm2-2.2.4-9
fvwm2-icons-2.2.4-9
Red Hat Linux release 7.1 (Seawolf)

Thanks for any pointers or advice,

Wendell

I've recently switched displays and now I have less screen real estate
(I've gone from 1400x1050 back to 1280x1024 for reasons that don't
bear going into).

As a result, I'd like an auto-hiding panel on the bottom of my screen
roughly like the standard gnome panel. I think I could get the results
I want with FvwmButtons (though I'm open to suggestions if there's a
better module). But it has to auto-hide to be maximally useful.

I'm a little confused by the FAQ though. The last entry says that
autohide is possible in "fvwm-2.5.8 or later" but the most recent
release is 2.5.7 AFAICT.

Trying the FAQ lines anyway in 2.5.7, I get

[FVWM][__execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'TestRc'

You are using either fvwm 2.4.15 OR fvwm 2.2.4.
You can't be using both.

Fvwm 2.4.x reads $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
Fvwm 2.2.x reads $HOME/.fvwm2rc

There is a conversion program in Fvwm 2.4 that will convert
a Fvwm 2.2.x config file to a Fvwm 2.4.x config file.

You are right, 2.5.8 hasn't been released yet.
To use 2.5.8, you need to get the CVS version.

Hi Scott

Many thanks ! Equal-width tabs now working perfectly.
The new "showTitlebar"-function is also very convinient.

Just two additions:
1)
The example fvwmtabrc doesnt mention the new feature "fixedSizeTabs".

2)
I am not exactly sure what the State function should do, but according to
the source it should be useful when fvwm is restarted. But then its not
working for me.

What i do is: 
 - Alt-tab for new TabManager
 - auto swallow some aterms
 - fvwm restart
 - <TabManager is gone>

Respond to fvwm@fvwm.org, not to me.

The stuff above will create a race condition between the
pager starting and the rest of the config being read.

Start the pager with:

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPager

Hi Scott

I found a Bug in the current 2.3 version. In
old v2.1 its working normaly.

I use multiple desktops and open the TabManager
in one desktop. After switching between Desktops
i cannot get the focus back to the Tabmanager and
only can get it back by pushing mouse button on the
background (or moving the TabManager by shortcuts).

In v2.1 focus is automatically regained after
entering Desktop with the tabmanager in it.

You apparently start fvwm-themes-start, not fvwm.
Your ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc is ignored in this case.

Either start fvwm or use the fvwm-themes rules to define the personal
adjustments as described in its FAQ.

If you decide to continue with fvwm-themes, then you may create file
~/.fvwm/themes/personal/modules-extra with one "DeskTopSize 2 2" command
and follow the instructions in the fvwm-themes FAQ. Or choose modules
from other themes, some use DeskTopSize 2x2.

Regards,
Mikhael.

FROM:KHIN M. LWIN
E-MAIL:lwinkm01@netscape.net
Dear Sir/Madam,
I apologize for the unexpected nature of this mail. I got your e-mail
address from the Thailand intercontinental peace group.
I am Khin Myint Lwin, 55, Chinese/Burmese, and the leader of the Myanmar
Kyone Yeom Group headquartered in Mong Yawn, Myanmar. We engage in Real
Estate, food processing and the transportation of Chinese, Thai and
Burmese migrant workers to destinations around the globe.
I am writing you from my Yangoon home where I await my appeal case
against a 37 years jail sentence I received for alleged human trafficking,
illegal
sale of gold and running a prostitution ring. I am currently under house
arrest. My appeal hearing is set for December 2003.
These are all trumped-up charges. One of my boats carrying migrant
workers to Singapore last year was hit by waves and sank killing 87
passengers they suspected me of funding the Karen National Liberation Army
(KNLA), a
rebel movement fighting for the rights of the Karen ethnic group in Myanmar.
The government has also seized most of my assets valued at nearly one
Billion dollars ($973,000,000.00) in Myanmar, Thailand and
China.
My wife and three daughters (8,12,14) are now staying with my mother
in-law in Mandalay. They now face a severe disruption in their livelihood
and
the education of my daughters is in jeopardy. This feels me with so much
pain. My wife and daughters are my main concern right now.
I have a cash account deposit I made in the Netherlands, which the
Burmese government didn't know about. When I liquidated my flower and
electronic
companies in the Netherlands in 2002, I deposited the proceeds of Eleven
million dollars ($11,000,000.00) in a securities firm in the Netherlands
while I was negotiating the take-over of a telecom company in Germany.
Right now, I need this money so I could get the best lawyer for my appeal
case coming up in December and most of all get my family out of Myanmar
to a safer country. They face constant harassment from government agents.
I need your assistance to get some of this money through to my wife and
daughters who are in Mandalay. Your responsibility will be to assume the
new ownership of the money. Transfer this money into your own account for
safety
first.
You will keep 20% for your efforts. You will then send my share in bits
as I family to leave Myanmar. I can also get the best lawyer and lobby power
and most possibly be free soonest.
ownership changed to yours. I can do this online and via email. Luckily, I
can monitor the status of my deposit via the Internet with my login info.
When all is done, the company will contact you about your new status. They
will tell you what to do. Most of their transactions can also be done
online. After that, you carry out the directives as explained above.
If you do this, I will be personally grateful to you in many ways. Not
only in the 20% of ($11M) reward you will get, but also when I am free, as I
know I will soon, I will show you what it means to do me a favor.
If you can't, or decide not to, I will understand. Thanks for your attention
anyhow.
Regards,
Khin Myint Lwin

Greetings,
  I'm currently running fvwm-2.4.17 under Compaq Tru64 unix 4.x.  For a 
while now my mozilla windows havn't been getting any decorations or show 
up in the window list.  Occasionally, one of the dialog windows does get 
decorations, but most of them don't.  I have no Style settings my rc 
file that would prohibit this, and I'm at a loss to explain why it 
doesn't even show up in my window list.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
-Jason

I think I've at least figured my terminology mistakes:
- the FvwmDesker is a separate window with 4 Desks (Main, Web,
  Devel, Games), each of those are a 3x3 window 'thing' (Desktop?)

- the FvwmButtons is a window with a clock, xload, xbiff, and
  one 3x3 Desktop(?) labelled Main.

I'm trying to get the Desker information into the FvwmButtons,
if that is possible.  It seems that I need to modify something
similar to

  *FvwmButtons: (2x2, Frame 2, \
        Swallow "FvwmPager-Single" "Module FvwmPager FvwmPager-Single * *")

in FvwmButtons and create my own FvwmPager-XXX module, correct?

I suppose I will, as I'm not sure what to do if I abandon it(!).

I did, but it still seemed to be ignored also.

Thanks for the hand holding, but I really want to figure out
fvwm/fvwm2/fvwm-themes.

The fvwm terminology is: FvwmPager shows one or several desks with 3x3
pages inside each desk, FvwmButtons is a kind of an application panel.
Every desk has its name (like "Main").

There is a convention in fvwm-themes to have 2 pagers, one that
shows the current desk (FvwmPager-Single, it is often swallowed in
FvwmButtons) and one that shows 4 desks (FvwmPager-Desker).

If you insist to change the modules in the default theme (this is not the
best thing to do, because your changes will be lost on the next install)
then replace the line above with:

  *FvwmButtons: Geometry 100x450-0-0
  *FvwmButtons: Columns 2
  *FvwmButtons: (2x8, Frame 2, \
        Swallow "FvwmPager-Desker" "Module FvwmPager FvwmPager-Desker * *")

You may need to read the FvwmButtons man page to create new button bar
designs (all man pages may be found in the menu).

If you have fvwm-themes related problems then I suggest you to subscribe
to fvwm-themes-users@ mailing list and describe them again.

You may want first to explore the menu, there are different options to
choose from and different themes have different sets of options. It is
possible there is already something you need.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, I am getting closer and closer to a configuration that I like. 
For me, (as I have mentioned before) I like to know how stuff works and
not just slap up someone elses config file (although they provide a lot
of inspiration)

I have one question about images used in titlebars and other panels. 
There doesnt seem to be a guideline as far as how large an image should
be in titlebars.  Is there a size that is too big that would possibly
use too much in the way of resources?

And, I am thinking that I will be using FvwmButtons as my "taskbar"
since I am not able to get rid of the label from FvwmTaskBar...unless
someone else knows another way.

Thanks!

Hi Tobias,

: The example fvwmtabrc doesnt mention the new feature "fixedSizeTabs".

Ah, thanks.

: I am not exactly sure what the State function should do, but according to
: the source it should be useful when fvwm is restarted. But then its not
: working for me.
: What i do is:
: - Alt-tab for new TabManager
: - auto swallow some aterms
: - fvwm restart
: - <TabManager is gone>

After you restart FvwmTabs should automatically create a tab-manager &
re-swallow your aterms. (if it's working properly that is!)

Can you replace this line:

+ I Test (ToRestart) Function SaveState

with:

+ I Function SaveState

in the fvwmtabrc file & try again. Tell me what happens.

SCoTT. :)

Hi Tavis,

: Wow, you sure are keeping us packagers busy :)

Hey cool! Do you have a webpage that tells users of your distribution
(Gentoo Linux is it?) how to download/install FvwmTabs? I'd love to
put a link on the FvwmTabs webpage (next to Xavier's link for Debian
users).

SCoTT. :)

Yep, Gentoo Linux, All users who have the `perl` and `tcltk` USE flags
set when they install fvwm automatically get FvwmTabs for no extra
charge :)

USE flags are basically configuration options or settings (Gentoo
installs all applications from source, so we can make compile-time
features optional)

To guarantee they get FvwmTabs, a  user might do this

# USE="perl tcltk" emerge fvwm

Thanks!

Yep, but we dont have a flag for just Tk, the tcltk flag is described
as "tcltk - Support for Tcl and/or Tk", so with the combination of the
`perl` flag its close enough :)

what about a solution that share space equally among others tabs,
and set the current tab size to at least the size of others,
or bigger if needed ?

this way it's looking good when i'm switching tabs, and have only 3 xterms 
in a tab, and it's  usable too when i have huges titles, or
many windows.

Actually only Perl is needed. Neither Tcl/Tk nor Perl/Tk nor other things
like X11::Protocol are needed in order to run a properly written perllib
module. It should open an error window describing which Perl classes are
missing in the system for that module. They may be installed later.

Mikhael.

I have a keyboard with two keys on either side of the spacebar that have
a hollow diamond on them. I think these keys are the equivalent of the
Windows keys. xev reports that they are the super_l and super_r keys.

I have not yet found any program that takes advantage of these keys. I
would like to use these keys in keyboard shortcuts with fvwm. Is this
possible? From the documentation it seems you are limited to the shift,
ctrl, and alt keys as modifiers.

Thanks.

I also use gentoo. It seems that the ebuild does not install the patched
X11-protocol package. I got weird errors:
"
Use of uninitialized value in string eq at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/X11/Auth.pm line 97.
Argument "XCMiscGetVersion" isn't numeric in int at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/X11/Protocol.pm line 2028.
Module FvwmTabs started with X11::Protocol version 0.51_2.
"

But perhaps i am wrong, since i havent looked into it right now.

The patch is getting applied, although it looks like Scott has released
a new version since I put a copy of it on to the Gentoo mirrors, I've
updated it. 

Those errors appear to be harmless, but I'll fix them anyway :)

VGradient is destructive style and Pixmap is partially destructive,
so the order of applying both using AddButtonStyle matters.

Also ButtonStyle or AddButtonStyle require the button number or "All",
so your second example is incorrect (it misses "All").

Also I suppose you use 2.5.x, because 2.4.x does not have shortcuts
AllActive/AllInactive.

The correct config for 2.5.x would be:

ButtonStyle All \
	AllActive   (VGradient 64 rgb:5a/6d/c5 rgb:4a/59/a5 -- flat) \
	AllInactive (VGradient 64 rgb:93/a1/a8 rgb:7c/8c/93 -- flat)
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap iconify.xbm
AddButtonStyle 2 Pixmap close.xbm
AddButtonStyle 4 Pixmap max.xbm

If you need more correct examples, take a look at fvwm-themes configs.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Gentlemen:

         I am poorly skilled in windows management, and yet I cannot get 
help from the University staff.  So I am hoping someone on this list can 
help me.  I am trying to develop a system for administering tests in a 
computer lab.

         The test is coded as a java application that I want to run on a 
full screen.  When done, I instruct the student enter text in a box, upon 
whichthe java program terminates, but until that time, I do not want the 
student to be able to resize the window, close the window, toggle to 
another window or anything else.  About six years ago, with the help of a 
unix consultant, we used the first version of fvwm to do this.  We simple 
executed "fvwm&" and then our java program.  We've been told now that we 
exploited some bug in that first version (perhaps some option in the 
.fvwmrc file), but this version no longer runs on our Solaris 9 system.

         Our computer lab is equipped with SunRay terminals.  A terminal is 
logged into a unix server, and then a simple gnome terminal window 
appears.  From that prompt, we want to launch fvwm -replace&, and then our 
java application.  From looking at the online fvwm manual, it seemed that I 
should be able to turn off the title bar buttons by commenting out the 
appropriate lines in the .fvwmrc file (which I did successfully).  However, 
I was still able to resize the screen by grabbing onto a border, and 
double-clicking on the mouse sometimes brought the original gnome terminal 
window back on top, from which a student could easily kill the 
program.  Also, after shrinking the window, and clicking outside the 
window, a menu of fvwm options came up, among which was to exit fvwm!

         I suspect that I could replace my default .fvwmrc file with a 
simple config file that would give me a maximized window with no title bar, 
no grabbable border, no accessible menus, and no way to close the window or 
exit our program until we want to by inputting a password.

         I would be profoundly grateful to anyone who could help me with this.

Sincerely yours,



Dale O. Stahl

Hello,

I'd like to be able to have the background of the text for certain xterm
icons be different colours to others, to make it easier to find them
when minimised - in this case to make it easier to tell root terms from
user terms.

This is no problem - I can do it with a Style line. The problem is that
if I 'su' in a normal terminal FVWM doesn't change the style for that
xterm to the root term style.

The title bars of my xterms begin with text in the form
'(<user>@<hostname>)' which updates after an su, but FVWM doesn't react
to the change.

Is there any way to make FVWM change the style for a window without
restarting it?

Cheers,

Andy

Yes, manually issue Recapture. Or RecaptureWindow for individual windows.

There is also an automatic solution using FvwmEvent.

I would like WindowId not to be suggested for the things that do not
require it. For 2.4.16+ use:

  AddToFunc winame_event
  + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("entering*") Style $n Colorset ...
  + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("exitting*") Style $n Colorset ...

And for the future 2.5.8+ use a more appropriate:

  AddToFunc winame_event
  + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("entering*") WindowStyle Colorset ...
  + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("exitting*") WindowStyle Colorset ...

Mikhael.

Supposing you already know how to launch your application maximized to
the full screen so no root background is left visible, here is
~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc for 2.4.x and 2.5.x versions doing what you want:

  # disable Alt-Tab
  Key Tab A M -

  # disable page scroll
  EdgeScroll 0 0

  # cause test application to stay on top and be borderless
  Style YourAntiStudentJavaApp Layer 10, NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

Replace "YourAntiStudentJavaApp" with a real window name.

If you have problems to start your application fully maximized by
specifying -geometry or similar, then reask again or take a look at the
FAQ question 3.18.

Mikhael.

Hi,

i have a few questions concerning different parts of FVWM which I use in
version 2.5.6 in combinatino with rox.

a) I would somehow like to have a key command to place my mplayer on top
and visible on all virtual screens (for example to whach a video whilst
surfing, chatting whatever). I only found out, that I can use StaysOnTop,
but that somehow just would keep thew window on top, not on all virtual
screens.. What would I have to do?

b) I would like to jump to a certain window containing a programm (for
example to write a script that always opens program x on a certain
command). can I somehow grep through WindowList? and if so, how can I then
focus window xy? Next question then: can I use these commands from within
a bash script or how would I do all this? (i am a bit new to this all, I
just got the configs from a friend and I am still trying to figure it all
out)

c) At work I have a Matrox G450 with 2 Monitors. Set it up in my
Xf86config, but it somehow isn't what I want. My optimal configuration
would be 2 totally separate monitors with their own virtual screens.
Switching from one phyiscal monitor to the other would _only_ work via a
key command, not by moving the mouse somewhere or doing anything else that
could happen accidentally. Is this possible? Can anybody give me some
hints how to approach this?

Well, I fear this is a bit much for my first time on this list, maybe
somebody can help me anyway, I would be very greatful anyway.

Cheers,

Julian

Hi, it is me yet again....I am having trouble 

I want to use a image (png) for FvwmTaskBar and it is my understanding
that I would need to set up a colorset to do this.  However, it never
seems to "take"

Colorset 10 Tiledpixmap image.png, fg black

Is this not the right way?

You should read the fvwm man page. You may discover the things you always
wanted to have and don't know the terminology by merely reading it.

The command you want is:

  Style MPlayer Sticky

Or the following makes it sticky by pressing Shift-Ctrl-M from anywhere:

  Key M A SC Next (MPlayer) Stick

Add FvwmConsole to your menus or launch it on a key like Alt-F12, then
invoke it and type any fvwm commands in it (the same commands you put
into .fvwm2rc). Run, for example, commands "Beep" or "Module FvwmIdent"
from FvwmConsole.

Another way tp remotely control fvwm is to run FvwmCommand (read its man
page).

You want to read about conditional commands in the fvwm man page, like:

  Next (MPlayer) SwitchToWindow

  DestroyFunc SwitchToWindow
  AddToFunc   SwitchToWindow
  + I Raise
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

Please read about MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS and XINERAMA in the man page.
It suggests:

  EdgeScroll 0 0

There are other Edge commands, powerful, but a bit tricky to understand.

You may either enable or disable Xinerama in your X depending on what you
want to achieve.

Mikhael.

Please don't post before the quotes.

Seems ok although it is better not to mix the Back/Fore method and
Colorset.

Did you define colorset 14 at all, or only colorset 10?

Do you have png support, check with fvwm-root?

Do you have readable image.png in your ImagePager?

Mikhael.

i find the man page a bit difficult. It might be okay for just reading but
it I want to search for certain things a reference or even a tutorial or
whatever would really help. is there anything like that?

errm, I don't exactly know if I understand you properly or so..
What I want is to have a key for a certain program. If it isn't running, i
want it to start, if it is running i want it to be raised and focussed.
is that what you wrote?

Sorry, didnt realize this was bad.... :(


I have png support built in, colorset 14 is set ( was just using
colorset 10 as an example earlier although it too is defined.)  

I am not entirely sure if I am just having ImagePath issues or if I am
if I just dont know what I am doing.

I have been playing around with an FvwmButtons configuration that
someone here had done and I like the way it looks but I thought I might
like FvwmTaskbar better for the autohiding capabilities and i like for
my buttons to look pressed in....doing some google searching, it looks
like it can be done with FvwmAuto?  Any way,

But sometimes, the icons I used would show up and sometimes they
didn't....

Can't figure it out...will continue to work on it. Which is why I
wondered if perhaps I was using colorsets incorrectly

Thank you for the help.
Catherine

Thanks mikhael.
  I think AllActive syntax is a little confusing since intuitively
All + Active = All Active.
 but then, it might be just me and my senses.

You can't omit the button number parameter in ButtonStyle, it's mandatory.

AllActive is a shortcut for Active + ToggledActive that are shortcuts too
for ActiveUp + ActiveDown and ToggledActiveUp + ToggledActiveDown.

I guess reading the command documentation may help too. :)

Mikhael.

When my module (FvwmSaveWindow) is called from a menu or button (by the
use of SendToModule), I do this in my module-code:
$module->send("Send_WindowList");

This causes an event-handler being called:
$module->addHandler(M_WINDOW_NAME, sub {
    my ($module, $event) = @_;
    ...
});

My problem is that I would like to know some data (mainly position and
size) about the window which was selected when the
"Send_WindowList"-command was issued. I can't seem to find a reasonable
way to get this in the handler.
I tried to listen for M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW-event, but then I might get
another window's data since the focus may change during the time between
tha handler is called and the M_WINDOW_NAME-handler is executed.

I could maybe call the module with the window-id explicitly in the config:
SendToModule FvwmSaveWindow $winId "save"
(or however it would look like?) but I would rather do it in the 
module-code.

Hmm, hope you can figure out what I mean by all this.. guess my english
isn't so good, or maybe I'm a bit confused and tired, well well..

Hello,

Thanks to all that replied. I've tried implementing what you suggested, 
but it's not working yet. I was hoping someone could spot what I've done 
wrong..

I have the following in my various fvwm .rc files:

*FvwmEvent window_name winame_event
Module FvwmEvent

Colorset 1 fg #cccccc, bg #555570
Colorset 2 fg #cccccc, bg #990000

DestroyFunc winame_event
AddToFunc winame_event
   + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("*(root@*") Style $n Colorset 1
   + I ThisWindow (Xcmd) ThisWindow ("*(ara@*") Style $n Colorset 2
   + I Exec exec echo "The function fired"

When the title of a window changes I get the line "The function fired" 
output at the console, so I'm happy that the event side of things is 
working, but for some reason the style of the window is not being 
updated to the second colorset.

I am using 2.5.7, if that is relevant.

Many thanks,

Andy

Hi Scott

Sorry, i was not at home for the last 2 days.

The Tabmanger is correctly restarted and swallows the specific
aterms if i use the "+ I Function SaveState" line instead.

You should remove the "ThisWindow (Xcmd) " bit, or replace it with
"ThisWindow (XTerm) ", otherwise it will never match your window.

The fvwm version is always relevant when asking on this list.

I think you do this correctly. The window size/position is passed using
M_ADD_WINDOW or M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW events, not M_WINDOW_NAME.

Continue with this, it's the only way. Another way will be using
WindowList tracker (but not very soon) that will hide all this black work
from you.

I am not sure what is your problem, you already get the window context of
SendToModule command in your code (M_STRING event).

If your module would be transient (not your case) you could run it from a
window context rather than from StartFunction. In this case the window
context of your module may be found in $module->{winId}.

Mikhael.

I am trying to get Gaim windows for example to autoshade when the mouse or focus leaves the window. 

I ripped this function from the mailinglist:

<snip>
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOn
AddToFunc   AutoShadeOn I WindowShade True
DestroyFunc AutoShadeOff
AddToFunc   AutoShadeOff I WindowShade False
Module FvwmAuto 0 "Silent AutoShadeOff" "Silent AutoShadeOn"
</snip>

I would like to be able to use this function for Windows that have the State set to 1 or something else, but how do i set the State command value to something without clicking on a button?
The prefered way would be to do this:

Style Gaim State 1, StaysOnTop, TitleAtLeft, Layer 4

But that doesnt seem to work at all, or is there any other way to decide at a configuration file level which windows are gonna use the above AutoShade function?

I hope some of you fvwm2 hackers can help me out with this.

Best Regards /* Johannes */

Use window context, not style, like:

  Next (Gaim) State 1 on

You may set the state for some windows when you start them, see FAQ 3.18.

  AddToFunc SetShadabilityForCertainWindows
  + I ThisWindow (Gaim) State 1
  + I ThisWindow (Miag) State 1

It's the hi (hilight) color of the colorset definition specified using
MenuColorset and ActiveColorset of MenuStyle.

Hi,
Is it possible to start chosen windows in maximize state?
I would like to set up that windows in the fvwm config file via "Style" 
command for example.
Thanks

I have a single button that move me to the next desk:

Is there a way to have the button change it's background (or text or icon or...) along with the desktop? i.e. red for desk 1, blue for 2, etc?

thanks!

If your button content should not be changed, but buttons should use
different colors, then simply define separate colors for your buttons.
This may be done with or without colorsets (red for desk 1, blue for 2).

In 2.5.x it is possible to dynamically change the button's Title and
Icon, assign Id to a button and issue this command:

  SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeButton id1 Title "^^"

Or use the button order number as the button id.

See FvwmButtons man page if you have more questions.

Mikhael.

To clarify. I mean here, if you have different buttons, for example 4
buttons, one per desk. This may or may not be what you have.

Hi!
I have recently installed fvwm2 on Mandrake 9.1 but I can't see any ico=
ns (in the menu and in window decorations). I made double sure that XPM=
 support is on - during ./configure - it does not report any errors. Ho=
wever, after running startx, I get a full page or messages as "can't re=
ad /xxx/yyy/fvwm2icons/abc.xpm". I also made sure the xpm files are rea=
dable for everyone.

I also am running RedHat9.0 on the same machine, with identical .fvwm2r=
c file, and there everything is ok. However, on RedHat I installed fvwm=
2 from a rpm file, while on Mandrake I compiled it from source.

Any ideas?
Thank you.

Make sure the files in question really are xpm files.

Do:

file xxx.xpm

you should see:

home> file ~/icons/mini.fvwm.xpm
/home/dane/icons/mini.fvwm.xpm: X pixmap image text

PS: Looks like someones mailer is whacked (equal signs),
and replies aren't being inserted in the "right" place.

It is on my home computer so I will test that as soon as I am at home, =
however, those files are installed from the standard package fvwm-icons=
. Do you still think they may not be real xpm files?

No, the fvwm-icons package should be all xpm files.

abc.xpm is not the name of an fvwm icon.
Post the exact text of the error message you get.
Also do:

fvwm -V

(this will show whether fvwm has xpm support)

If these are XPM files, then you didn't compiled XPM support in.

Run fvwm-config --info, or try to load these images using fvwm-root.

Hello,

Is there a way to move windows using the Outline style without causing
all the applications running to freeze?  While I'm moving the outline
none of the other windows on the screen update.  They resume updating
once the move is complete.

I've tried using OpaqueMoveSize, and this allows the other applications
and the window being moved to continue to update.  This is good, but
the window being moved leaves "echos" of itself on the other applications
on the screen because they can't redraw quite fast enough.

Is there a way to combine outline movement with the ability to allow 
the other windows on the screen to continue to update?

Everything you said is correct and thus the answer is no.
The outline move may be done a bit nicer, but this is not what you want,
since it grabs the X to be able to undo its fancy lines while moving.

If you want to allow other applications to redraw themselves during the
window move, then the only good solution is to fix the slow application
expose redrawing. Technologies like clipping and background drawing may
help applications to do it effectively.

Notice how fvwm window decorations themselves are redrawn quickly and
without flickering on opaque move even for very complex decorations
(I mean, in 2.5.x, not 2.4.x).

(I may only dream about modules like FvwmButtons being as fast.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
This a little bit late but good going on 10 years.

How long using FVWM, first used, am I still using it......
Boy now there's a question, I can't really remember when I first
encounted FVWM must have been somewhere around middle of 94??????
Could well have been earlier by some 6 months max.
Currently running 2.4.17. Most flexible WM

Greatest WM ever, Keep up the Great work

I have been trying to understand something in the man pages for
FvwmButtons regarding invoking FvwmButtons with an Optional Name.

Does this mean that i can have mulitple instances of FvwmButtons running
with differnet configuartions as long as I give each instance a
differnet name?

Thanks
catherine

Yes, some modules support module aliases.

The man page you refer to even has examples of defining several panels.
Each panel is a separate FvwmButtons instance.

Hello.

I am going to try to adapt the icewm-menu-gnome2 program
from IceWM to dynamically generate Gnome2 menus for FVWM.
But for that I need to know if the command PipeRead can
be recursive, that is, the output of the command argument
to PipeRead can contain another PipeRead, and that one
is also executed?

Something like

  PipeRead "fvwm-menu-gnome2 --list /usr/share/gnome/vfolders/"

where the output of the command

  fvwm-menu-gnome2 --list /usr/share/gnome/vfolders/

have calls to PipeRead.

Regards,

Romildo

I am not sure why do you ask rather then just try it:

  PipeRead `echo 'PipeRead "echo Menu MenuFvwmRoot"'`

Yes, nested PipeRead works.

However, you don't really need it. In your script just use loops to
generate several menus at once.

Or use dynamical submenu features to call your script again on submenus.

See the output of existing fvwm-menu-* scripts for different approaches.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think that the following Python module can be useful
for that:

http://www.cojobo.net/~h_wendel/stuff/pyxdg-0.4.tar.gz

With this module and a few lines of python you can generte
an "elementary" GNOME2 menu for fvwm.

Also, you can take a look at:

http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/menu-spec
and
http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/basedir-spec

I see ....... You are right:

When I run
	$ fvwm-config --info
I get
	Package: fvwm
	Version: 2.4.16

	Instalation options:
        	prefix: /usr/local
        	exec-prefix: /usr/local
        	bindir: /usr/local/bin
        	datadir: /usr/local/share
        	libexecdir: /usr/local/libexec
        	sysconfdir: /usr/local/etc
        	mandir: /usr/local/man

	Compiled-in paths:
        	Module directory: /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.4.16
        	Data directory: /usr/local/share/fvwm
        	Default ImagePath: /usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps
        	Default UserDir: $HOME/.fvwm

	Support for features:
        	gnome-hints (window manager hints): yes
        	gtk (FvwmGtk): no
        	gdk-imlib (in FvwmGtk): no
        	gnome-libs (in FvwmGtk): no
        	multibyte: no
        	readline: no
        	rplay: no
        	shape (shaped windows): yes
        	sm (session management): yes
        	stroke: no
        	xinerama: yes
        	xpm: no
.....................
But during installation it looked all fine:
in-the-fvwm.src-directory:
# ./configure > aaa
# cat aaa | grep -i xpm
checking for XpmReadFileToXpmImage in -lXpm... yes
checking X11/xpm.h usability... yes
checking X11/xpm.h presence... yes
checking for X11/xpm.h... yes
checking for Xpm 3.4g or better... yes
  With XPM support?                  yes
.........................
What went wrong? Any ideas now?
Thanks a lot!

You didn't say that you didn't define your own prefix and configure says:

  Executables: /usr/local/bin

You also didn't convince us you did "make install" after that.
Or maybe you did, but it failed without write permissions to /usr/local.

The only sure thing is the /usr/local/bin/fvwm executable on your system
is not that you built with the "XPM support? yes" output above.

Mikhael.

Hallo everybody,
Thanks for the previous answers.
Now I would like to ask You how to detect whether mouse button is 
released - for example I would like to close a window when I release 
mouse button.
Thanks & regards.

I have done some changes to the icewm-menu-gnome2 and now
I have a version supporting FVWM menus.

I would like that someone take a look at the way I have
done it and make comments, as I do not have much
experience with FVWM.

In my FVWM configuration file I have the following:

#----------------------------------------------------------------
DestroyMenu RootMenu
AddToMenu RootMenu
+ "Gnome"	Popup GnomeMenu

AddToMenu GnomeMenu "Gnome" Title
+ DynamicPopupAction Function GnomeMenuF

AddToFunc GnomeMenuF
+ I DestroyMenu GnomeMenu recreate GnomeMenu
+ I AddToMenu GnomeMenu "Gnome" Title
+ I PipeRead '/var/tmp/icewm-1.2/src/icewm-menu-gnome2 --wm fvwm --name G=
nomeMenu --list /usr/share/gnome/vfolders'
#----------------------------------------------------------------

The output of the command executed with PipeRead above, in
my Gentoo Linux system, is attached to this message.

Any comments?

Hello.

When using fbpanel (a light-weight desktop panel)
with FVWM, I want to restrict the working area to
the full visible screen except for the screen area
used by fbpanel, which is placed at the bottom and
has a height of 26 pixels.

I am trying the following in my configuration:

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec fbpanel
+ I Wait fbpanel
+ I EwmhBaseStruts 0 0 0 26

but it is not working. Placement and maximation of
windows is not respecting the working area set
with the command EwmhBaseStruts.

How is the easiest way of accomplish this?

Regards,

Romildo

Using EwmhBaseStruts. Works in 2.5.5+. Maybe it does not work for you on
restarts because you placed it in InitFunction instead StartFunction?

You may place this command in the top level, not in a function, and
specify the exact geometry for fbpanel. Or, if you for some reason need
this particular command order, use this:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I None (fbpanel) Exec fbpanel
  + I None (fbpanel) Wait fbpanel
  + I EwmhBaseStruts 0 0 0 26

I am running FVWM 2.5.7 and I am still having problems with windows
covering the fbpanel window, even with the EwmhBaseStruts command.

The command I use for maximizing windows is 'Maximize layer grow grow'.
As I said, maximized windows are getting beyound the working area.

New windows may get placed beyound the working area too, when the
screen has few empty areas. The placement style I am using is
"MinOverlapPlacement". I want no window over the fbpanel window.

I have tried setting the layer for fbpanel, but it did not worked.
I have the command "Style "fbpanel" StaysOnTop" in my configuration
file, but fbpanel is still put in layer 4:

$ xprop | grep -i layer
_WIN_LAYER(CARDINAL) = 4

I tried that, but I did not find a way of starting fbpanel with a
given geometry. The program does not accept a "-g" or "-geometry"
option. It supports placement at one of screen edges (left, right,
top, bottom), chosen at its configuration file. This is not a
solution because fbpanel without a user specified geometry obeys
the working area.

I had to add the CirculateHit condition to the None
commands, otherwise it does not match the fbpanel window.

Any clues?

So it works as expected (kind of). It is possible that it was not
intended for "layer" option to imply "ewmhiwa" option too.

Anyway, use "Maximize grow grow" or change the panel layer to do what you
want.

These are only hints. What to do with windows larger than the screen
size; one or another strut should be compromized.

Dominik changed the behaviour of StaysOnTop and other similar Style
options. It now works for new windows only. For existing windows use:

  All (fbpanel) Layer 0 6

I think it was intended.

Dear Sir,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to
me by a member of the South African Export Promotion
Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference
talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to
seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because
of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I
work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation
and with the co-operation of three other top
officials, we have in our possession an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain
percentage of the total contract value executed on
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$28.500,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain
good relationship with foreign governments and
non-governmental agencies. We intend to include our
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and
the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). So we are
seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the
 unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate
foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary
information upon application for claim to reflect
payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of
you/your company.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be so
negotiated and agreed upon by both you and we on this
side, before further details will change hands to
enhance our primary objective.

The business is completely safe and secure, provided
you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not
matter whether you/your company does contract projects
as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of
you/your company to settle any legality. Also, your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint us.

For further , do not hesitate to contact me
on this my private email account, then after
i shall furnish you with the details of my lawyer,
his name is barrister Don Ronald Benfica
who is presently in Madrid spain

Awating your urgent response.

Mr. MANUEL SISILU

My intention was to put fbpanel on the top layer (6), And then
common applications (on layers less than or equal to 6) would
not maximize over fbpanel. But putting fbpanel on top layer
failed.

"Maximize grow grow" instead of "Maximize layer grow grow" is
not what I want, since it would avoid maximizing windows over
windows in the same layer.

But most windows I work with are not larger than the screen size. They
may be put over other windows except the fbpanel. In other words, if
the window fits the working area, it should be put completly in the
working area.

I do not undestand this. In my FVWM configuration I have:

#-----------------------------------------------------
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I None (fbpanel, CirculateHit) Exec fbpanel
+ I None (fbpanel, CirculateHit) Wait fbpanel
+ I EwmhBaseStruts 0 0 0 32

Style "fbpanel" StaysOnTop
#-----------------------------------------------------

Isn't the Style command executed before the Exec
command? That is, when the fbpanel command is
executed, the Style command has alread been
executed (fbpanel is called after FVWM initializion,
since it is called in StartFunction). Then it should
be a new window and it should be put in the
top layer. What is wrong in this reasoning?

Nothing is wrong here, if you issue the Style command in .fvwm2rc
and not in FvwmConsole, then it should work.

It is possible that fbpanel puts itself on layer 4 using GNOME or EWMH
hints. Does "Layer +1" command work on fbpanel?

If no, try to add some Ignore hint option to Style fbpanel to disallow
fbpanel to put itself on a different layer. It is also possible fbpanel
has a GUI dialog to set its layer, I am not familar with fbpanel,
but I know the GNOME panel has it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

The Style command is issued in .fvwm2rc, but fbpanel puts itself
on layer 4.

"All (fbpanel) Layer 0 6" in the StartFunction works (fbpanel
is put in layer 6).

This works.

I have tried 

   Stye "fbpanel" EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints, StaysOnTop

but fbpanel still puts itself on layer 4.

Mikhael, thak you a lot! You solved my problem:
I configured and compiled fvwm more than a month ago. By that time I did not pay
attention to the output of ./configure and probably it was without the xpm
support. My system changed since then, I installed many things and it seems,
also the xpm libraries, but I did not remember that (I am a Linux beginner so
sometimes I do strange things).
Recently that I finally decided to fix the fvwm icons problem, I re-run the
./configure to find out that I had the xpm support libraries, but I did not
re-run make install.
Now I cleaned and reinstalled all fvwm and all is fine, I have my icons!
I good lesson for me!
thank you

Except to point that you twice posted "Stye" instead of "Style", I don't
know. I don't have fbpanel to verify this.

If Style does not work for you, just add:

  Next (fbpanel, CirculateHit) Layer +2

after Wait fbpanel.

Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael,

Is there any way to determine the desk/page a window is on from
within a Perl module?

I've got a test module where I send "Send_WindowList" & get back
a whole lot of M_WINDOW_NAME events with some details about all
the windows (but it doesn't appear to contain desk/page number info).

My desire is to add some sort of 'SwallowAllOnPage' or
'SwallowMatchingOnPage' functionality to FvwmTabs.

SCoTT. :)

If you send "Send_WindowList", the first 2 returned events will be
M_NEW_DESK and M_NEW_PAGE, try with FvwmGtkDebug or FvwmDebug.

But you don't need to worry about this, you should use PageInfo tracker
that gives you the constantly updating current desk and page.

no, you can use all the modifiers 1-5. You need to check to which modifier
super is attached (e.g. with xkeycaps -pm) and then use this number in
the key binding commands. I'm using the super key e.g. as modifier5.
Additionally you may have to "undefine" a few default key bindings.

I'm new to fvwm, and I have a number of problems getting it configured
exactly as I want it. If anyone can point me in the right direction for
any of these problems I would appreciate it.

First off, I'd like to have an FvwmIconBox on my second screen
(Xinerama), and whenever I iconify a window, it's icon appears in the
FvwmIconBox. When I click on that icon, it deiconifies, and disappears
from the FvwmIconBox. I do not want to see any icons on the root window.
I also do not want to see any icons in the FvwmIconBox for windows that
are not iconified.

I almost sort of can do this. Here's what I have so far.
I have function that does these two things when I go to iconify a
window:
Iconify true
Style "$[w.resource]" NoIcon

I also have set Style * IconBox none.
Unfortunately when I iconify, say a terminal window, and I have more
than one open, I get on icon for each window in the FvwmIconBox. I
haven't figured out how to do the reverse at all.

My next problem, is that I am trying to create a Vgradient down the
border of my windows, this is what I have tried:
*FvwmTheme: Colorset 2 Vgradient 1000 rgb:00/00/00 rgb:FF/FF/FF
Style * BorderColorset 2

It seems that the border actually takes the color that is a blend of the
first and second colors, as opposed to having a smooth gradient down the
border. Is this even possible?

Finally, my last question. Most of my main windows are maximized on my
primary screen. I have also removed their window borders, as I have no
need to resize, or move them, I simply go to another page of the desktop
if I need some empty space. I would like any additional windows of these
programs to have a border. For example, the main Evolution window is
maximized and borderless. The window in which I type this message is
smaller and on top of the main window. It kind of floats there right
now, because it doesn't have a border. I'm not sure how to get the kind
of fine grain control out of the style command to be able to put a
border on all Evolution windows except the "main" one.

Thanks for any help.

It was wrong only in the message, not int configuration
file.

Setting fbpanel layer with Style does not work.
But adding

   All (fbpanel) Layer 0 6

after Wait fbpanel in the StartFunction does work.

fbpanel does not have any GUI dialog for set up. Its
configuration is done through a file configuration. But
it seems that there is no option for setting the layer
in it.

Yes, only in 2.5.x.

Please search the mail archive for a lot of examples in the past.

Is there anyway of having a panel or menu slide out/up/down when you put
the mouse over it instead of actually clicking on an option.  I guess it
would be similar to mouse over effect on a webpage or similar to the way
you scroll over popup menus.  

So far, I have been having fun making Panels with FvwmButtons but have
not been able to figure out how to make Panels or Menus pop out from a
button.

Thanks
Catherine

Hi everyone

When I execute 'Restart' (I have it bound to CTRL-r) my xmms
occasionally dies.

The FAQ seems to almost prohibit any mentioning of xmms on this list.
Would that apply to this problem too?

If not, what additional info can I supply to help in finding the cause
of this problem?

I'm running fvwm 2.5.8 on Debian sid with kernel 2.4.22-1-686, XFree86
version 4.3.0. BTW this also occurred with fvwm 2.5.7, with more stable
(Debian sid) XFree86 versions.

Thanks

Since it's xmms that dies, I think you need to contact the xmms
developers.

Howdy,

I'm wanting to give some users access to one program when they log in. 
When they quit the program, they are logged out. I'd like to use fvwm, 
as it seems to be well suited for this sort of thing. Running with no 
configuration files, it's almost what I want out of the box. No 
background, no menus, no nothing. To get the rest of the way, I need to 
know how to do the following:

1) Launch a program at startup.

2) Completely eliminate all virtual desktops.

extra credit) eliminate the menus that appear when you click the desktop.

If anyone can help me out on these, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Tad

Start it before fvwm if that is what you want.

Did you read my answer to the "locking screen" question a week ago?

It sounds like what you really want is to just set that one program as the 
window manager for that environment. Does the program really need to have 
window handling support?

For example, if you are using xdm, and you set the window manager for 
those accounts to the path of the program you want them to have access to, 
then their session will be tied to the running of that program, and when 
they quit, they will effectively log out and xdm will return.

It depends on whether or not you need them to be able to move windows 
around, close windows, etc. It sounds like you really don't.

But if you insist on using a window manager,

You could start the program up without any window manager, using xinit.
For example :

xinit ./quake2 +set game action -- /usr/bin/X11/X :1

(You don't even need to start X to do this)

I have this line in my .fvwm2rc file:

Style *GVIM* NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, NoHandles

When gvim starts up, it has a border. If I type this into the
FVWMConsole, the gvim border dissappears. I want all of my gvim windows
to have no border. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks.

Hello all,

I'm hoping there's a fix for this 'cause I want to stick with FVWM. 
Absolutely love the WM.  I'm running on RH9 and was using Bluecurve for 
a while (Gnome).  It's alright, but bloated, restrictive, etc.

I "grew up" on Irix, and FVWM was an immediate plus when I saw it many 
moons ago.

My problem is this:  I run various applications here at work that are 
causing me some issues.  (The sad thing is that they don't cause issues 
while running under Gnome.)  Take, for instance, the PolicyEditor window 
from Checkpoint Firewall-1.  I have that window up and running, and at 
various times while I'm working with it, I receive the following error 
in my term, and then the window dies:

Wind/U Error (146): Too many GC's allocated.  Bad match of GetDC/ReleaseDC?
Wind/U Error (124): Function wuSetGCFromDC, could not allocate a GC.

Other issues arise while running that same PolicyEditor window, and then 
bringing up RM6 (Sun's RAID manager).  The initial window is OK, but 
after opening up any of the other windows (Configuration, Status, 
Recovery, etc.) and moving the mouse over one of the buttons near the 
top of the window, that window dies.

As you can imagine, this is making it very frustrating to work.

Is there something that I can do during a compile that will prevent this 
from happening to these windows?  Is there debugging I can look at to 
help find the problem?

This happens with a few other windows.  I'm not sure if they have 
anything in common or not.  Any help/guidance would be appreciated.

Thanks!!

Gvim, doesn't use the name "*GVIM*" as it starts.

Try:

 Style gvim NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, NoHandles, HandleWidth 0

works for me.

Regarding RM6, I spent many hours trying to debug that problem
earlier this year.  I don't remember the details, but you should be
able to find the excruciating details in the archives.

See "Premature close of OpenInterface GUI" thread, November-December
2002.  Bottom line:  It's an RM6 problem.  RM6 is an OpenInterface-based
GUI, with some very unconventional windowing behavior.  For example, if
no window manager is running, the RM6 windows will unilaterally decorate
themselves using pseudo-MWM-style decorations (rather arrogant behavior,
to my way of thinking).  The problem has been reported to Sun, but they
were disinclined to open a bug report - since RM6 works fine under dtwm,
olwm and twm, they would only sign up for opening a "request for
enhancement".  We didn't pursue it here, so chances are good it's still
broken.

That's not acceptable.

I understand it may be a RM6 problem, or a Checkpoint problem (their 
windows cause the same behavior), or an EMC problem (their GUI seems to 
have problems, too), but why are other window managers able to handle 
the problem and not FVWM?

It's forcing people like me to have to abandon FVWM, which sucks, but I 
have no choice.  I can't work on the things I need to work on if the 
windows don't stay up.

Is there anyone out there using gdesklets with fvwm?  Gdesklets is a fun
app kinda like karamba and superkaramba for KDE. I have been trying to
get a few of the applets for it to run and they are kinda wierd when
using fvwm.  For one they are not completely visable.  It is like part
of the window is cut off.

I can use kahakai and gdesklets and it seems to work okay.

There is one app in particular for gdesklest that has a launcher bar
that I would like to use...it is pure eye candy.  It has an animation
very similar to OSX.

If there is a way to have a launcher bar using fvwm that is animated,
that would  be great too.

Thanks for the help

Not acceptable?

Here's the bottom line on what we found out,
and this should give you some idea of how hard we tried:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0212/msg00286.html

What remains is for someone (not me) to report this problem
to the vendor.  You can go to Sun, or anyone else distributing
RM6.  I believe the software originates with LSI.

If you have any suggestions on how to fix Fvwm, let us know.

I had the same question last November.  After listening to the fvwm
workers make a good-faith attempt to get to the root cause, I have since
changed my question:  What might Sun be doing to accommodate a GUI that
doesn't play by the rules?

Unfortunately I can't help here, and I am not familar with the situation,
since I (happily) don't use propretary programs myself.

If I understand what Gregg Dameron said, this application has some
conditions looking like this:

  if (WM_DETECTED)
      do this
  else
      do something different

If the condition detects twm and dtwm, but not fvwm, then the application
executes different code under different window managers. This does not
say anything about window managers, this only says the detection code in
the application is probably buggy. It is not fvwm that closes windows,
they die because of some incorrect premise causing internal errors.

You may try again to convince the application owners that this is their
bug, and they should fix some code in the application.

A similar attitude is seen on some web sites that are only written to
work with Internet Explorer. If you ask the site owners, they will answer
other browsers are broken (because they tested all browsers they have,
i.e. IE5, IE6 and it worked) and never suggest their site code is broken.

I understand your frustration. I am really happy I may live without sites
that require IE only. I don't know what I whould do then.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm no developer!

I'm frustrated, though.  I'm not trying to put the blame on the FVWM 
developers by any means so please don't take it that way.  I'm just 
saying that if other window managers can handle these situations, why 
can't FVWM handle them?

Read what we did, all the details of what we found are available.

If you want this to work, send a problem report to Sun.
If I had the software installed at work, I would qualify to file
a bug report, but I don't.

Someone that is a registered user of RM6 has to take the initiative.

Someone here will probably be  willing to change  Fvwm, if thats whats
needed, but we have no idea what to change.

I'd be willing to do whatever to help you guys out.  All I need to know 
is what to do.  I'm not sure I'd know what you're looking for anyway, so 
it'd be best if you guided me through.

I did notice that the PolicyEditor (from Checkpoint Firewall-1) seems to 
be the cause of the problems for me.  When I have that application 
running, it will not allow me to start the GUI from EMC for their backup 
product.  It's also when I have this PolicyEditor up when RM6 starts 
acting up.  Individually they're OK (I think).

Let me know what I can do to help.  Even if it's an application problem, 
maybe I can help you find out a protection against the windows dying.

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:
- Allow re-ordering of tabs via mouse (drag-&-drop) & key bindings.
- Fixed really annoying bug where some tab-managers would not accept
  key-bindings.
- Updated fvwmtabrc file.
- bugfix: titlebar was expanding when windows were resized.
- Remember selected tab b/w restarts.

SCoTT. :)
