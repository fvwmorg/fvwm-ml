I have a few problems with fvwm2.1.2;  can anyone help me with them
please?

1. (This probably existed in earlier versions also!)  Contrary to the
   documentation, modules do NOT read the initial configuration file
   (.fvwm2rc), but rather they read the file that was last read.  So,
   for example, if I use the FvwmAnimate module, and it creates a file
   .FvwmAnimate in my home directory, and then start the FvwmTaskBar
   module, it looks in .FvwmAnimate for its configuration rather than
   .fvwm2rc - and therefore doesn't work properly!.  This is just an
   example;  it applies to any file read with the "Read" command, and to
   any module (so far as I could see).

2. Some windows seem to automatically grow when their contents change.
   I have seen this happen in netscape, and also in tkman.  This is a
   new "feature" in 2.1 as I didn't see it in 2.0.x.

3. In my .fvwm2rc file I have the following:

Mouse 0 2       N       Maximize-Func
Mouse 0 2       C       Maximize 100 0
Mouse 0 2       S       Maximize 75 75
Mouse 0 2       M       Maximize 0 100

   This allows me to maximize a window in either the horizontal or the
   vertical direction by using the control or meta keys in conjunction
   with the mouse.  It worked fine in version 2.0.x, but the control, shift
   and meta key combinations no longer work in 2.1.x.  Why?

I can verify this behavior as I've seen it as well.  It's sporadic tho.

I am running Fvwm 2.0.45 and I can see this happening in that too.

The workers are aware of this bug but are having some trouble isolating
when it occurs.  If anyone can consistentlly create this problem please
let me know.

It appears that FvwmTaskBar is not reading its configuration correctly.
(It is in the "extras" directory after all.)

Originally fvwm modules got passed the name of the  config file as arg
3,  and they opened, read,  and parsed all the  commands in the config
file.   If your  .fvwm2rc  contains any read  commands,  the file read
becomes the  new arg 3  passed to modules.   This leads to the problem
you detected.

What  FvwmTaskBar   should  be doing  is   asking  fvwm2  to  send  it
configuration information through  the fvwm2-to-module pipes.  If  you
want to know when  this is fixed,  you will have  to subscribe  to the
workers list or wait for an announced beta.

The other modules  should not have   this problem.  Please  report any
that do.

The module man pages may  say that they  read the .fvwm2rc config file
because thats what they used to  do, or because the actual explanation
is complicated.  I'll take a look.

I believe this has to do with a click time bug we found right after the
release this one line fix in fvwm/fvwm.c should fix it.

	So, and just for confirmation, if I change something in the .fvwm2rc for 
a particular module, fvwm2 must be restarted to get the new behavior of the 
module, right ?

Its  not clear to me how   your question relates  to  the problem with
FvwmTaskBar which currently seems to get confused by "read" commands.

Most (all?)  of the older  modules need a  restart to be reconfigured.
There is work  underway   to "fix" that.    FvwmAnimate (when   it  is
released) will demonstrate that.

	Sorry, it's probably due to my poor english.
	It was related to the way other modules than FvwmTaskBar work.

	Ok, that is what I wanted to be sure. Thanks.

	This behavior is not a problem for me, provided that all the modules 
work the same way.
	BTW, is there a lot of trafic on the workers list ?

Heya all

 Been testing fvwm for use in my company. Ran into 2 small issues with
FvwmButtons swallowing FvwmPager.

1st the specs. version 2.0.46, compilied with gcc. Solaris 2.5.1 sparc 5.

1: Occasionally on restart, even though the pager is swallowed by the
button bar, a second free floating pager appears. I suspect this is a
timing issue since I have FvwmPager specified in both the RestartFunction
and in the button specification. I am just curious if anyone else has seen
something similar.

2: Here is the fun one.

Create a button bar with a swallowed pager.
resize the bar. Pager resizes.
Inside the pager, drag a window (using mouse button2) from one page to
  another.
Resize the bar. The pager no longer resizes. It stays in a static position
in the window. It is still swallowed because it moves when you move the
bar, but it stays at the last known size, no matter how much you resize
the window.

 I tried playing with respawn as part of the swallow options. It seems
that the pager respawns every time you move a window in it as described. I
am guessing this is related. 

Any ideas? I did a quick search of the archives and didnt see anything.

Thanks

-Andrew

I tried this out and now I have two pagers, one of the original size and one 
of the resized button bar. And both are totally screwed up.

Thankyou, but I'm afraid that code doesn't seem to match the file I have:
fvwm-2.1.2 : fvwm/fvwm.c.

Line 474... is:

** StartupStuff
**
** Does initial window captures and runs init/restart function
*/
void StartupStuff(void)


Looking for "if (Scr.ClickTime < 0)", I found it in the following
context (starting line 499):

}
  if (Scr.ClickTime < 0)
    Scr.ClickTime = -Scr.ClickTime;
} /* StartupStuff */

No. 2 is fixed in the next fvwm. No. 1 is probably the same bug

This line

  fFvwmInStartup = False;

must be directly before this one:

  HandleEvents();

The place you want is at the bottom of main in fvwm.c

just before calling HandleEvents() you want to insert
fFvwmInStartup = False;

I'm sorry, but you seem to have quite a different fvwm to me.  I could
find the HandleEvents() line at the end of main quite easily, but the
compiler knew nothing about fFvwmInStartup.  Looking through, I couldn't
find anything even similar anywhere in the source code.

Brian.

Sorry, I have found the answer.  Version 2.1.3 has come out since I
last looked.  The patch is for that version.

Oops, I just noticed you were looking at 2.1.2 in your last message, so
now that you have the right source and the patch are you still seeing
any problems?

Announcement to arrive in just a few minutes.  In case you're not on any of
the lists, there is plenty of new development, several new versions, and a
new web site at fvwm.math.uh.edu.

The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the first official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.4). Available at

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/

it includes the following features:

*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug
   tracking system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).
*) Mini title windows for FvwmPager (aka Balloons).
*) FvwmEvent is the successor of FvwmAudio. FvwmAudio is still
   available.
*) FvwmTile and FvwmCascade modules were replaced by
   FvwmRearrange. Shells for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade provide
   backward compatibility.
*) Improved FvwmButtons button placement to give absolute control
   over where the buttons are placed.
*) Color limiting (previously available thru patches).
*) Multiple Icon Boxes, Icon box grids, and Icon box fill
   direction control (previously available thru patches).
*) Faster startup.
*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability.
*) Many small enhancements too numerous to list here.
*) Consistent copying policy.
*) GNU autoconf support.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be
found at:

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/NEWS.html

Although the maintainers feel this beta is quite stable there are
some known problems that shall be fixed before the final release
(and some that will have to wait). You can find a list of known
bugs in the BUGS file at the top level of the distribution.

Before you report a bug, please read the manpages, the NEWS file
and the FAQ too. If you can solve your problem this way but still
feel the information was too hard to find, please tell us.

To submit a bug, please follow the link to the FVWM bug tracking
system on our web page.


Beta testers needed:
====================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.

              **^** THIS IS IT FOLKS **^**

This is THE Letter that you have been reading about in the News lately.
 Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
 nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
 investigation of the program described below , to see if it
 really can make people money.  If you saw it, you know that
 their conclusion was that while most people did not make the
 $50,000 discussed in the plan,EVERYONE who followed the
 instructions was able to make 100 to 160 times their money at
 the very least. The show also investigated whether or not the
 program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that
 there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the
 program.  This has helped to show people that this is a simple,
 harmless and fun way to make some SERIOUS money at home..
 
 " This is one of the most exciting opportunities, with the MOST
 income potential on the internet today"- - - 
     

Hi, my name is Steve. After I saw this letter aired on the news
program, I decided to get some of my skeptical questions answered.
Question #1- Does it really work ? Until I try it, I can only go on
the testimony of people I don't know, so I will only know if I try it. I've
never done this type of thing , but I decided it was time to try
something. If I keep doing what I am doing, I'll keep getting what I've
got. Besides, people 70 years old have been surveyed and they will 
consistently say that the 2 regrets that they have of their lives are;
        1) they wish they had spent more time with their families and
        2) they wish they had taken more chances.
Upon hearing this again, and hearing what the Media said about it,
I decided that at 28, I was going to take a small chance and see
what would come of it.
Question #2- Is it legal?- Yes,( Refer to Title 18, Section 1302 & 1342
of the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws)
This opportunity isn't much of a risk and could turn out to actually
be a bit of fun.
Bottom Line; The risk is only $20 and time on the Internet...
         
The following is a copy of the Letter the Media was referring to:
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

--------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL
 MARKETING PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do: We send thousands of people a
product that they paid us $5.00 US for, that costs next to
nothing to produce and e-mail back to them. As with all multi-
level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. 
allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your
computer).  We are not promising you anything.  You have to put
forth some effort to make this business work, but come on how
hard is emailing! The products in this program are a series of
four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each
order you receive is to include:
  * $5.00 cash United States Currency
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they
    ordered.

To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.
THAT'S IT! The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic 
multi-level marketing business anywhere!

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE 
 PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!  

       ******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:

1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell
   them if you don't order them).
*  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
   REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
   RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person
   whose name appears on the list next to the report.
*  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the
   four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you can
   save them on your computer and resell them.
*  Within a few days you are to receive, via e-mail, each of the
   four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be
   accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
   order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
   listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in
   any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through
   "d" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.Once
   you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it
   doesn't work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been
   tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.

    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name
        and address under REPORT #1 with your name and address,
        moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.

    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down 
        to REPORT #3.

    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down
         to REPORT #4
    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed
        from the list and has NO DOUBT collected large sums of
        cash!

Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!
       
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
   and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the
   instruction portion of this letter.

4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
   WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB can be very, very
   inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to
   advertise. Another avenue which you could use for advertising
   is e-mail lists. You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 
   addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you.

     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!

5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them
   the report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY
   SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!  This will help guarantee that the
   e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on it, will
   be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the
   report!  To grow fast be prompt and courteous.

-----------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it
works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on
your first level.  (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet
will EASILY get a larger response.)  Also assume that everyone
else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow
this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.

1st level--your 10 members with 5 = $50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) = $500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000) = $5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000) = $50,000
THIS TOTALS ----------->$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would
happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Lots of people get
100s of participants!  THINK ABOUT IT!

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet
connection and e-mail is FREE!!!

REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing
and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors
even work on trade!

About 50,000 new people get online every month!

*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS********

TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately.

*  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them
   when the orders start coming in because: When you receive a $5
   order, you MUST send out the requested product/report to
   comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title 8,Sections
   1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
   also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436,
   which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for
   money received."

*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

*  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
   instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be
   SUCCESSFUL!

*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******
Follow these guidelines to help assure your success: If you don't 
receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue
advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you
should receive at least 50 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't,
continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 50 or
more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash can continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You
can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people
are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!
There is no limit to the income you will generate from this
business!

NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a
business name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your
local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal
agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the 
Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free
seminars about business taxes.   
If you have any question of the legality of this letter contact

Commission Bureau of consumer Protection in Washington DC.

*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! 
Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of
potential income.  I'm living proof that it works. It really is a
great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program 
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.
                                 Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS   

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this 
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached
several times before I checked this out.  I joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 19 weeks, with money still coming in.
                       Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am,
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back.  Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size
post office box crammed with orders!  For a while, it got so
overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.
I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life
before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter 
where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better
investment with a faster return.
                                 Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI.

       
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I 
didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first
try!!
                                    D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your
family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck
and happy spending!
                                Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

I am nearing the $90,000 mark from this program. I have used several
forms of advertisement.I used regular mail and bulk email.The regular
mail was very expensive for 2 reasons. I purchased a very select list 
names, and the postage.The 3rd time I sent out e-mails, in the 
quantity of 700,000.So, after 3 times participating in this program,
I am almost at the $90,000 mark. That isn't too bad. I hope the
same success for you. Good luck....
Raymond McCormick, New Cannan,Ct.

your finger-tips!  You have unlimited access to wealth, but you

THAT!!!!!!  You could be making an OBSCENE amount of money! I 
Have given you the information, materials, and opportunity to
become financially better off. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!- THINK
ABOUT IT-Your risk is only $20.? How much do you SPEND on Lotto

Hi,
	I installed this version on my PC running Linux. Some of the new
features are really exciting, such as FvwmAnimation and the balloons in
the pager. However, I seem not able to get the panel
working in FvwmButtons. I thought I might have done something wrong so I
just copied the example from the man page exactly, i.e. as below:

the following was still what I
got when I click on the bottons "WinOps" and "Tools" (they are supposed
to let out panels):

'/opt/libex

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'Tools' in ModulePath

Anyone got ideas? Thanks.

i'm using fvwm-2.1.4 and when i hit the up or down cursor key after a menu
popped up, fvwm suddenly dies without any message. it does not matter wether
the menu is calles by a hotkey or mouseclick. when the mouse pointer is
outside of the menu area the two keys will just cause the menu to disappear.

running on rh5.1, linux kernel 2.0.34, xfree 3.3.2.

a small note: keep up the good work. i really love the stability, speed and
configuration options of fvwm!

not a real bug, but just something which can be easily improved imo..

when i issue the "Move" command with no active window, the mouse pointer
cannot be moved by using the cursors.

This is still about the problem I described last time about not able to
get panels to work in FvwmButtons. I finally got it working. The problem
seems to be that I had to specify the direction of the Panel : 
*FvwmButtons(Panel (up) test,Title test)

Although in the man page it says that up is the default, it doesn't seem
so in my case. But anyway, it's working. I plan to use this instead of
FvwmWharf as I did before. It would look much better actually if it has
animation.

Hi, I think I've found another two bugs in FvwmButtons using panel in
fvwm-2.1.4 on my linux 2.0.36 PC.
 I have a buttonbar composed of a few panels, like the flollowing:

*FvwmButtons(Title Terminal,Icon xterm.linux_3d.xpm,Panel (right)
Terminal)
*FvwmButtons(Title PPP,Icon ppp.xpm,Panel (right) PPP)
*FvwmButtons(Title Softwares,Icon pick_3d.xpm,Panel (right) Softwares)
*FvwmButtons(Title Games,Icon games.xpm ,Panel (right) Games)
*FvwmButtons(Title WinOps,Icon bomb_defuse_3d.xpm,Panel (right) WinOps)
*FvwmButtons(Title Exit,Icon quit.xpm,Panel (right) Exit)
#*FvwmButtons(Title ,Icon ,Panel (right) )

and in the panel "Softwares" I have two more sub-panel defined:

*FvwmButtonsPanel Softwares
*FvwmButtonsGeometry +0+0
*FvwmButtonsRows 1		
*FvwmButtonsBack bisque2	
*FvwmButtonsFore #f020f0
*FvwmButtonsFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

*FvwmButtons(Title Emacs,Icon gnu-animal.xpm, Action  `Exec
/usr/bin/emacs &`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title Plan,Icon cal_3d.xpm, Action  `Exec
/usr/local/bin/plan`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title ICQ,Icon icq.xpm, Action  `Exec /home/gxu/bin/ICQ`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title StarOffice ,Icon office.xpm, Action  `Exec
/home/gxu/opt/Office50/bin/soffice`) 
*FvwmButtons(Title Top,Icon xload.next.xpm, Action  `Exec
/home/gxu/bin/xtop`)
*FvwmButtons(Title Audio,Icon Music.xpm,Panel (up) Audio )
*FvwmButtons(Title Graphics,Icon paint2_3d.xpm,Panel (down) Graphics)



The first bug comes like this:
When I press the botton "Softwares" to bring out the panel "Softwares",
then press the botton "Audio" in the panel to bring out a second panel,
a child of the first one. I press the botton "Softwares" again, the first
panel "Softwares" disappeared, but the panel "Audio" is still there,
hanging in the air!!

The second bug: if I bring out more in one panels at a time such as
"Terminal", "Softwares", "PPP", etc., and press a button in any of these
panel bars, as the command gets executed, all the panels disappear! I
believe the right way is either the panel with the button I pressed should
disappear and the others should remain, or they should all remain until
being pulled back manually. 

Did anyone else on other systems experience the same thing? I'd like to
know if this is a bug of the program. Thanks.

Best wishes,
G.Xu

Your previous messages, and my success in adapting my FvwmButtons
set-up to the new format, led me to experiment a bit with
FvwmButtonPanels.  I copied the WindowOps example from the man page
and got it working (with the addition of the Up as you mentioned) but
it froze my session once, necessitating a hard reboot, and once it
killed X.  I've gone back to not using FvwmButtonPanels.  

Aside from those problems, everything's fine here, with a pretty
standard 486 Slackware Linux 2.0.32 gcc 2.7.2.2 system.

Thanks for the reply. I think you have a point there. However, the second
one I mentioned, maybe there could be an option to control the actions of
the panels (i.e., the user can specify if the panels will withdraw or not
after a button is pressed?)

There is one more thing I found out today. It looks like the buttonbars in
the panel do not have support for *FvwmButtonPixmap. This works for my
root panel, but no other panels could use a pixmap background. Was it
designed to be that way or just forgotten:-)?

all the best,
-g

Hello,

# Desk arg1 [arg2] [min max]

Key Page_Up     A       M       Desk -1 1 0 3
Key Page_Down   A       M       Desk 1 1 0 3

I have 4 desks, numbered from 0 to 3 and DeskTopSize is set to 2x1. When
I want to go the the next or previous desk, using the PageUp and
PageDown, I get some strange behaviour. I can only move between desk 0
and desk 1. It seems that the max parameter always contains the value
"1". When I set min to an negative number, it works "well". at least,
fvwm seems to switch to the unexistent desks, according to my pager. But
changing max into any other value, doesn't influence the bindings.

Discarding the range, min and max parameters, works ok.

Greetings,

Wing Tung

Hello,

Could someone _please_ write a hack to
embed shell scripts into a .fvwm2rc
file. Then shell scripts can be invoked
from within a .fvwm2rc file as fucntions.
This would make distribution and maintenance
of .fvwm2rc files a lot easier. I like my
.fvwm2rc files to be self contained.

Thanks,

Neil

Where should I actually put my bug reports? To the fvwm-workers mailing

I used to see the .fvwm2rc file as a huge block of data, but some time
ago, I downloaded the fvwm2gnome config and I discovered the Read
command. You can split up the file and organize it in directories. Still
not really functions, but it is much more maintainable.

My config looks like this (just to give you an idea):

.fvwm2rc
.fvwm2gnome
  |--- icons
  |--- backgrounds
  |--- config
	  |--- pager.config
	  |--- buttons.config
          |--- menus.config
          |--- functions.config
          |--- backer.config
   ....

I have now installed 2.1.4, and all of the problems I mentioned in my

Hi,

I am confused which config file should I use. I have installed the =
RedHat 5.1 and configured the XF86.
I find that .fvwmrc is for ver.1.xx and .fvwm2rc is for ver.2.xx, right?
How can I find out which version I am running (beside looking at xinitrc =
because I cannot interpret it properly)?
Do I then use the appropriate configure file in my home directory?

Many thanks and regards,
Michael

right

go ahead and look at your .xinitrc.  At the bottom there should be a 
line saying "fvwm &" or maybe "fvwm2 &".  To be sure of which 
version your running, find the shortcut ("fvwm" or "fvwm2") and do an 
"ls -l".  That'll tell you where the link points.  I'm afraid i can't be any 
more specific 'cause i'm in windoze right now.  I'll get Linux configured 
during Christmas break.  Right now exams are my major priority.

Since your running RH 5.1, i'd wager to guess that you are running 
fvwm 2.0.xx (i've got 2.0.46 around here somewhere...haven't gotten 
around to installing it yet).  If u get a "windoze-ish" interface, then 
your probably running fvwm95 (a hacked config of 2.0.45...i think).

bon chance ("good luck")

Ah, but xinitrc is the key. I ran into the same problem myself, so I'll
tell you what I found out. I have RedHat 5.2 which has numerous window
managers, but the one that comes more or less pre-configured is fvwm2.
It
uses what you could call a "configuration scheme" called AnotherLevel,
which works as follows:

If you don't have your own ~/.xinitrc, the one that runs things is   
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc (no dot).
That in turn invokes Xclients (assuming no ~/.Xclients).
That looks for ~/.wm_style to see if you like things to look Windows
95-ish or Motif-ish (defaults to W 95 if no .wm_style). Then it invokes:
/usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM --Fvwm95 (assuming the W 95 case).
RunWM is actually a script which you can look at.

Here's where things get inconsistent. RunWM looks to see if you have 
~/.fvwm2rc.m4. If not, it's going to use
/etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4
instead. Lets say you don't have ~/.fvwm2rc.m4 for example. Then the key 
next thing it does is:

exec fvwm2 -cmd FvwmM4 -debug /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4

You won't see that literally, but if you look at what all
the variables evaluate to, that's what you've got. Now what the "-cmd
FvwmM4" means is that the file specified is written in the m4 macro
language and is going to be preprocessed by m4 before being fed to
fvwm2.
To go further, you must learn the basics of the m4 language (although
you
are free to throw out the whole AnotherLevel scheme if you want to in
which case you could forget about m4). Can't find the m4 man page?
Neither
could I. That's because it's documented using the "info" system. If
you're
an Emacs user, you know all about that. You can also just invoke "info
m4"
from the command line. This is much better than a man page. It is
essentially a hypertext tutorial.

Once you come back from learning m4, you can look at fvwm2rc.m4. Now
remember, if you want your own customized version, you have to copy it
to 
your home directory as .fvwm2rc.m4 (add the dot). But if you look at
what
IT does, you'll find a glaring inconsitency. It "includes" a whole host
of
m4 special-purpose configuration files. The default ones are all in
/etc/X11/AnotherLevel. But if you want to customize, say,
fvwm2rc.defines.m4 (you probably do), should you copy it to
~/.fvwm2rc.defines.m4? No, that would be too logical. Instead, you have
to
copy it to ~/.fvwm2rc.defines (NO .m4 SUFFIX!). Whoever came up with all
this obviously didn't want you to figure it out. The same goes for all
the
other subsidiary configuration files.

The -debug after the FvwmM4 above, does something very valuable. It
causes
much of (but not all) the output from the m4 preprocessing of all those
files into a file in /tmp. for instance the one created most recently
for
me is:
/tmp/fvwmrca02670. It's instructive to look at this and the m4 "source" 
files side by side. It is this that gets fed to fvwm2.

Well, hopefully that's enough to get you started. I have not found any
place where the AnotherLevel scheme is documented!

Your syntax is wrong. If arg1 is non-zero, arg2 must be omitted.
The 1 and 0 are taken as min and max in your example. The correct
lines are:

  Key Page_Up     A       M       Desk -1 0 3
  Key Page_Down   A       M       Desk 1 0 3

(Compare with manpage)

Why should you need a hack? Just say

  Exec my_shell_script

The only drawback is that you can't wait until the script
has finished. fvwm spawns a new process and continues.
Well, and you have to add 'Exec'. Is that a problem?

I need that myself quite often. What I do is (on Linux):

  AddToMenu Modules "FvwmPager" Exec "killall FvwmPager || FvwmCommand FvwmPager"

That's not nice and requires a special line for each of my applications,
but it works (as long as you have killall or sth. equivalent that returns
if processes have been killed). Actually I don't use it in menus but
in FvwmButtons. So I can pop FvwmCommand, netscape or a console window
up and down with a single button.

Please try to fetch a stack trace for me. Enable full core files if
necessary and on the command line type

  # gdb fvwm2 core
...(lots of output, make sure the core was generated by fvwm2)
  (gdb) where
...(stack trace follows)

Make sure you look at the right executable (add a path if
necessary) and don't strip the executables.

Are you sure you want this? What would happen with

Toggle "Exec oclock" "Exec xclock"
Toggle "Exec xterm" "Exec rxvt"
Toggle "Exec oclock" "Exec xclock"

What I mean is: do you want Toggle to look at its arguments and compare them with the
previous ones or do you just want to execute Toggle and have one of two predefined
commands happen?  If the latter then try:

DestroyFunc Toggle1
AddToFunc Toggle1 "I" DestroyFunc Toggle
+ "I" AddToFunc Toggle "I" command1
+ "I" AddToFunc Toggle "I" Toggle2
DestroyFunc Toggle2
AddToFunc Toggle2 "I" DestroyFunc Toggle
+ "I" AddToFunc Toggle "I" command2
+ "I" AddToFunc Toggle "I" Toggle1
Toggle

Cheers,
Tim.

If this is all you need you can use the presence of the window rather than try to add
state to fvwm.

AddToFunc TogglePager "I" Next [FvwmPager] KillModule FvwmPager
+ "I" None [FvwmPager] FvwmPager

you might need CirculateHit/CirculateHitIcon in the Next [] if you have
CirculateSkip/CirculateSkipIcon  set for FvwmPager.

You're right, that's much easier. In fact I'm an expert in shell
programming (zsh really helps :) ) and most of the time I try
to express everything as shell commands (and I don't like
reading lengthy manpages ;-) ).

Bugs should be reported in Jitterbug. If you pick an item from
list, you should report that fact to the list and tell us what
exactly you tested where (the test setup). I want not only to know
what went wrong but what was tested successfully too. If you find
lots of bugs you may want to post a short overview to the list.
But in the end all bug reports (hopefully) make it into Jitterbug
and it's better if you hack them in directly (otherwise I'll have
a boring cut-and-paste session).

Note that the fvwm-workers list automatically receives a copy of all
"incoming" bug reports, so there's no need to send anything to
fvwm-workers when you report a bug.  Info on any particular testing you
do, as Dominik mentions, can be reported to fvwm-workers.

Thanks.

PS. Also note that your bug report will probably not appear immediately
    on the web!  Jitterbug works via email, so your bug report will
    generate an email which needs to be processed before it shows up on
    the web.

    Don't despair!  And don't send it twice! :)

There appear to be TWO official FVWM pages, which I have arbitrarily
classified into old:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/		(which has NOT been updated)

and new:

http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/		(which HAS been updated)

I realize that it is unreasonable to maintain two different pages, but
there should at least be a notice (prominently) displayed on the old page
to point people to the new page.  

I was unable to find the e-mail addresses of the maintainers of either
page (and so I apologize for sending this to a list I am not a member of).
I also noticed that the FAQ on the new page refers to the old page as the
'official site'!  What is going on?  Finally, there is not even a version
number or date on the FAQ!  

The documentation for FVWM has always been a bit sketchy, but this is
ridiculous. 

If anyone wants my help with this documentation, feel free to ask.  I
could integrate these two web pages and add the missing information to the
FAQ.  Right now all you are doing is alienating the user community!

The new page has only been publicly available for about a week, the same
time as the 2.1.4 beta announcement.

Things are in transition, so there are still issues.  I'm not sure if
the plan is to leave the old page as-is until the official 2.2 release
is available, or whether we were just waiting to make sure the new page
didn't fall down before completely switching, with a pointer or
something at the old location.

The best thing you can do to help is continue to note the problems and
report them to the fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu list.  If you want to help
more you can edit the files in the docs subdirectory of the latest beta
(which are the same things on the new web site) and submit patches to
the workers list.

Note we're aware already that the Links page on the new site is very
badly out of date :)

Hey, we try, sometimes we miss things.

Both pages point you to the fvwm-workers list.

Jason will be  updating the old  page to link  to the new page when he
gets a chance.   This is  the first workday  the  new pages have  been
announced.

I'll  go thru the FAQ  and update the  information on the Web site and
the references  to Fvwm.tmpl that were reported,   I'll be looking for
other things that are out of date.

The updated FAQ may take a few days to make it to our web site.

If you have  other problems with the fvwm  documentation, feel free to
bring them to  our attention.  Problem reports  in the form of patches
are welcome.

The 2  different sites  documentation  shouldn't need  integration, we
derived the new from the old.  If we missed something let us know.

Ah, so the new pages happened to coincide with the new release, so the old
pages got left behind...

Add a version # or a date!

I will do so.  Actually I think I'll join the fvwm list and get more into
the swing of things.

I'm sure it's ok, just needs a link from the old pages, a web maintainer
e-mail address, and a version #/date on the FAQ.  

Thanks for the quick reply!

Besides the already-mentioned tricks, there's also the "PipeRead"
command.  With this, you can change the configuration dynamically by
having a program output Fvwm commands...  I used this to create a
Windows-like "Documents" menu in Fvwm, for example.  I don't actually
use/like that particular menu, but it was a nice way to learn.  :)

I can't reproduce this with any menu style. Can you send me your
.fvwm2rc file? What exactly do you do to get the coredump? I need
a step-by-step description for idiots ;-)

I just upgraded to 2.1.4 and I miss an old patch that I really liked.
It makes all icons rectangular boxes in which the specified xpm is
drawn (instead of transparant icons). Much like AfterStep and
WindowMaker as a matter of fact.

Does anyone know where I can find this patch? Will it still work with
2.1.4?

Thanks in advance,
-Ives

Hi ppl!
I've just made some cool changes to fvwm2 (mainly cosmetics, it looks
nicer), and i would like to send a patch, but, how the hell can I make a
patch! (what a lame I am)

PS - I've had the menu problem too! (fvwm crashes when you hit a cursor
key while you have a menu open!)

Thanks!
LM

For each file you changed, do this:

  diff -u file.orig file

Where 'file' is the filename. If you diff does not have unified
diffs (-u) you can use contextual diffs (-c). This should be in the
FAQ too.

That is fixed in the CVS tree.

A patch wouldn't work unless we all had the same initial state of the
configuration file (I assume you're talking about a patch for .fvwm2rc).
This is unlikely, since everybody has a different initial state. What
you could do is post your *entire* .fvwm2rc on a web page or something.

But to answer your question, look at the info pages for diff. If you use
Emacs, you can get into info with Help->Browse Manuals
(Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals with Info in later versions) or ctl-h i
(that's the nicest way). But you can also just use the standalone info
program ("info diff").

Hello there
	I have fvwm2 working on a slackware 3.5 which I have just installed.
	It seems very good but one of the things listed in "modules" is save
desktop.It doesn't appear to do this.Does anyone have a suggestion for
where I need to look to find the problem and solve it?

Very likely, it doesn't do what you think it does.

Did it create a .fvwmdesk file in your home directory?

Hello again
	The /.fvwmdesk file is only a couple of lines long
	and only contains the following-
		Add To Func InitFunction
	    	"I" desk 0 0
		"I" Exec oclock - geometry 120x120+170x170+

It does not appeart refer to anything else.

	In the .fvwm2 file I found in /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc
the reference to saving the desk top appears to be related to a Module
called 'fvwm SaveDesktop'.While this has the same format of all the
other module references in that file it does not appear to cause any
event.Might it be that the actual 'module' is missing?

	regards  Steve Jarvis

Hello,

I am using the fvwm2 that came with RH5.1.
How do I turn on mouse autofocus so that when my
mouse is over a window, I can type in it?

Someone told me to uncomment this line in my $HOME/.fvwm2 file:
Style "*" MouseFocus

I did this and hit start>Exit FVWM>Restart on the menubar, but nothing 
has changed.  Do I need to exit X for FVWM to recognize changes?
Let me know if there are other files I need to change or load new stuff
into the xrdb database.

Thanks

I'm sure this questions has been asked but I couldn't find it in fvwm
archive or comp.linux* dejaNews.

How can I click anywhere in the windows to raise without a modifier (like in
mwm or MS windows)?  

I just started using fvwm1 on my Linux pc machine.  For some reason mouse
movement isn't very smooth compared to SGI, Sun, or MS Windows pc machines?
I guess that's X Windows problem.

Thanks for your help.

Steve,

I'm fairly certain you need to add those lines in .fvwmdesk to your
.fvwm2rc file in your home directory. Those two changes will take effect
when you next start or re-start fvwm.

I'd guess you need to add a line to your .fvwm2rc file to 'read .fvwmdesk';
the end of
the .fvwm2rc is a good place.
The read command is good for reading into your configuration all sorts of
things,
like scripts (see FvwmForm man page for  a few ideas).

Hi,

I ran into some problems while compiling the FVWM distribution
on Solaris 5.6
uname -a : SunOS solls1 5.6 Generic_105181-10 sun4u sparc
SUNW,Ultra-5_10
compiling w/ gcc : 
gcc -v : gcc version 2.7.2.1

I tried acc with no luck.
SC3.0.1 7/13/94
acomp: SC3.0.1 7/13/94 Sun C 3.0.1

This problem comes at first from the M_ERROR macro
which is present in /usr/include/sys/stream.h.
This was in Fvwmcpp.c
This was an easy fix, since I discovered that on some places
a conditonnal code could be seen :
#ifdef RPLAY
#undef M_ERROR /* Solaris fix */
#endif
So I undef M_ERROR ...
Then a new problem arrived ... this time, this was NBBY  ...
I ignored it ... Since a bigger problem came out :

Basically, this model.h defines a model (but I do not have a clue
about what it is right now), and if no model is defined, it 
complains. There are two models : _ILP32 and _LP64.
Anyway, when  I force the definition of one or another, this 
is not any better :

-----------

Ok, this output is a bit big ...
Sorry about that.

You might wonder why I tried acc ... just because I supposed
there might be some conflicts between the gcc includes and the
Solaris includes ...

I just wanted to know if somebody ran into similar problems on
Solaris. And if yes, what would be a quick fix ... without having
to check everything in the /usr/include includes for possible
conflicts, etc ...


Thanks for your help.
Anyway, this is the first time I try to configure this on Solaris,
this ran just perfectly under Linux ... but this is a different system
:)

No, restarting is more than enough. Basically the line above is
ok (although you might prefer SloppyFocus instead of MouseFocus).
Perhaps you have another line setting the focus style? I'd
search through the .fvwm2rc and see if something overrides you
setting (watch out for any line containing 'focus'). Please
have a look at the manpage too (Style command).

Its actually a rather simple problem, your gcc is built for solaris 2.5.1
and your are compiling on 2.6.  The solution is simple, rebuild gcc for
2.6 or compile on 2.5.1 and then copy it to your 2.6 machine.  This is not
an fvwm problem but a compiler problem.  I'm supprised this is the first
you noticed it, as soon as I upgraded to 2.6 I couldn't get a thing to
build with the old gcc.

Hi

I'm currently working with fvwm 1.xx and i would like to know if it's 
possible to create a menu, that doesn't
popup with a mouse-click or keyboard stroke, but stays on my desktop 
all the time?
Can somebody help me out? Thanks

I don't believe there is such a feature in fvwm 1.xx.
There are so many other ways to do what a menu does, (button bars,
root window key bindings, etc.) that pin-up menus haven't been
addressed.

I was about to reply that there is an easy way to do this in fvwm2,
when I decided to check and see if it still works in fvwm 2.1.4 and
discovered that it DOES NOT work in 2.1.4!

What I was using in earlier fvwm2 versions was something that started
like this:

	AddToMenu Window-Ops
	+	"Window Ops"	Title
	+	"Stay"          Popup Window-Ops

When clicking on "Stay", the menu would stick around.  Sure, it would
disappear as soon as I did anything else, but it would stay around
longer than otherwise.  Yes, I know there are other ways to do this,
but my point is that this no longer works.  It's broken in my
installation of fvwm 2.1.4.

Has anyone else seen this?

I can't follow. What version are you comparing that to? What are
you expecting and what does actually happen? The menu should
just open in a sticky manner until you select something or
click somewhere else, but to get this you don't need that
complicated logic (use Menu instead of Popup). In any case I
don't think that would be a positive answer to the original
question.

Thanks, everyone.

I guess I will install fvwm version 2 after all if I can get
click(window)-to-raise to work.

Mouse movement isn't too bad on P-90 but it's definitely worse in X than in
MS Win.  Of course just about everything else is better in Linux & X.

I can verify that something is wrong there. Apart from this
if you insist on having a 'Stay' item you should use

  +   "Stay"          Menu Window-Ops

anyway. This works and the triangle isn't displayed. I'm
seeing into this.

Hell there
	Thank you all for the advice.I have been merrily editing away at the
.fvwm2rc file for a little while now and can see that fvwm is extremely
configurable.
	Putting read.fvwmdesk does allow the saving of a range of positions of
xterms and other programs.I now also realise that editing the
configuration file directly can allow the imeadiate starting of other
programs.

Hmmm... the only time I've had problems with mouse movement in X is when
running Netscape. It seems it ties up the X server for seconds at a time in
a way no other client (that I've seen) does. Sometimes when there's heavy
disk activity the mouse pointer can become jerky, but other than that it's
fine. Perhaps it is some oddity of your configuration. Does the mouse work
okay on the console?

If the jerkiness really, REALLY bothers you, then you could always fork out
for a commercial X server like Accelerated X (http://www.xig.com I think) or
Metro X (http://www.metrox.com ?). I know the accelerated X servers have a
nice demo that lets you see how badly they kick the @$$ of Xfree86.

I bit and built the new version, and managed to install it. I'm
noticing some behaviors that puzzle me:

- FvwmIconMan starts out by issuing "*FvwmIconMan: cannot open
  /dev/console" and then goes on to send all kinds of debug info to
  stdout. Is there a way to turn this off?

- The 'panel' configuration syntax for FvwmButtons is different from
  the one I was using with a patch Buttons under 2.0.46. The new
  configuration syntax is probably better, except that I can't get
  even a simple example (or the manpage example) to work.

Any hints?

- Jim

I get this too.  I don't know how to turn it off, but definining a
console at least keeps it from printing to the display.

I have contool in my .Xinitrc, so the errors go to there.  When I boot
from a system that doesn't have console, I use the -C option on an
Xterm to grab the console output.

I've searched thru the mailing list archives, and haven't seen anyone address
this problem.  I need a way to restart fvwm2 via command line or something
similar.  I apparently have a buggy rc that will lose all changes to buttons
after a while, so I'm left with the default middle button and nothing else.
This means I can't restart via mouse1 on root.  I have tried to bind keys as
well, and all keymods get lost when this happens.  This has been happening
for about a year now, and it's stuck with me thru all the changes I've made
to my .fvwm2rc...any advice would be appreciated.

Chad.

Yes -- I think so.  I'm not an expert C programmer, but I found that
debug.h in the modules/FvwmIconMan directory has the following lines
near the top.

	#if 1
	#define PRINT_DEBUG      
	#endif

Since the lines that produce the console messages that I see all come
from the print_button_info(Button *b) function (in xmanager.c), which
is #ifdef'd with PRINT_DEBUG, then changing the 1 in debug.h to a 0
should turn off the debugging messages that we are seeing.  

This looks to be "hardwired".  If anyone out there knows a "soft" way
to do this, please let me know.

I meant to say if the system doesn't have contool, use xterm -C...
And now I DO know how to turn it off.

hey guys,

this is probably a stupid quetion, but, i will ask anyway.  When I put
this in my .fvwm2rc:

SetMenuStyle  default black grey60 grey50 blue fixed anim next
(TiledPixmap stone.xpm)

it does what I would expect, and puts the pixmap tiled on the whole
menu.  But if I put:

SetMenuStyle  default black grey60 grey50 blue fixed anim next
(DGradient 128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white)

Then I get three horizontal lines in the very top of the menu (they are
the color gradient), but the whole rest of the menu is grey60 (that is
what it looks like).  I would expect the menu itself to be gradient, not
three wierd line.  I would like to achieve WindowMaker like menus, is
that possible?

The F???? Virtual Window Manager workers list is pleased to
announce the second official beta test version of Fvwm2 (version
number 2.1.5). Available at

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/

it includes the following features:

*) New web site, overhauled documentation and a new Bug tracking
   system.
*) Improved menu handling with animated menus, improved cursor
   key navigation, individual menu styles and better overall
   flexibility.
*) Enhanced window and focus handling (SnapAttraction and
   Direction commands).
*) New commands for desks and pages (MoveToPage, MoveToDesk,
   FvwmPager showing the current desk).
*) Proper Windoze95 style Alt-Tab behaviour.
*) Animated iconification and window movement and animated panels
   in FvwmButtons (like CDE).
*) Mini title windows for FvwmPager (aka Balloons).
*) FvwmEvent is the successor of FvwmAudio. FvwmAudio is still
   available.
*) FvwmTile and FvwmCascade modules were replaced by
   FvwmRearrange. Shells for FvwmTile and FvwmCascade provide
   backward compatibility.
*) Improved FvwmButtons button placement to give absolute control
   over where the buttons are placed.
*) Color limiting (previously available thru patches).
*) Multiple Icon Boxes, Icon box grids, and Icon box fill
   direction control (previously available thru patches).
*) Faster startup.
*) Lots of bug fixes to improve stability.
*) Many small enhancements too numerous to list here.
*) Consistent copying policy.
*) GNU autoconf support.

A lot of bugs have been fixed since fvwm-2.1.4.

More detailed information on the contents of this release can be
found at:

  http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/NEWS.html

Although the maintainers feel this beta is quite stable there are
some known problems that shall be fixed before the final release
(and some that will have to wait). You can find a list of known
bugs in the BUGS file at the top level of the distribution.

Before you report a bug, please read the manpages, the NEWS file
and the FAQ too. If you can solve your problem this way but still
feel the information was too hard to find, please tell us.

To submit a bug, please follow the link to the FVWM bug tracking
system on our web page.


Beta testers needed urgently:
=============================

You like fvwm and want to help? Become a beta tester. You can just
download the distribution and run your latest setup with the new
beta, but I you feel like doing something really helpful, pick an
area from the following list, try to test it as completely as you
can and report your test setup to the fvwm-workers mailing list:

  <fvwm-workers@hpc.uh.edu>

 - Compile fvwm2 on as many different platforms and with as many
   combinations of options as you can (see INSTALL.fvwm for a
   list of options).

 - Try to break fvwm with exotic setups and syntax errors in the
   configuration file.

 - Play with the new menu features (animated menus, individual
   menu styles, position hints, cursor key movement etc.)

 - Test the new features in FvwmButtons (animated panels, button
   geometries, button placement algorithm). Panels are somewhat
   difficult to understand so please read the manpage (there are
   some examples).

 - Thorough test of FvwmPager. The configuration parser has been
   changed so every option should be tested.

 - Thorough test of FvwmIconMan. The configuration parser has
   been changed so every option should be tested.

 - Test the new module FvwmAnimate.

 - Test the new module FvwmEvent.

That's right, and its a bug. BTW I just noticed that I forgot
to update the manpage. The 'next' style does not exist anymore
from 2.1.5 up. You can give the (menuface) spec to any menu
style now, so there's no need for next.

Hi folks,

in the last few days I received an increasing number of
mails addressed to me and only me. *Please* everyone
don't reply to threads on the list to me directly. I am
*NOT* 'the maintainer' of fvwm2 but merely one of them
and the others are interested in the information too.
Furthermore if you send me mails directly I don't get
them at home where I do the work. And since my allowed
mail volume there is very limited, please don't reply
to my private address. All I will do with such mail is
forwarding it to the list (= more work for me).
If you are unsure if you should post large patches, ask
on the list. In general for everything up to 50k you can
post to the list without thinking twice about it.

Jason, Dan, does anything on the web page suggest that
folks should send mail to me? If not, could we mention
that explicitly (at least for a while)?

Thanks

Dominik

The man page lists up as the default direction, but the code wasn't
setting this.  It has been fixed in the next release.  But in the meantime
you can just put a direction in your panel definitions.

I'm not sure I understand are saying that you are making changes during a
fvwm session, through FvwmTalk or one of the other modules, and those are
not being saved to your rc.  If that is the case that is the correct
behavior, currentlly there is no way to get external changes to the
config put back into your rc file.

However if you mean your running and suddenlly everything changes in your
environment then I think we have a problem, if it is this second case I
think we would need to take a look at the rc file, and a better
description of what is going on when the problem occurs.

You need to set a "Reply-To:" field if you want replies to go to the
list rather than yourself.  This is documented in RFC 822 section
4.4.3.  I see that you have a "Mail-Followup-To:" but this is non-
standard.

Perhaps the majordomo could be configured to add a reply-to if none
has been set by the original poster.

If this is the case, the very first step is to provide (a) the version
of fvwm you're running, (b) the system you're running it on (both
hardware and OS), and (c) any special compilations or other non-standard
things you may be using.  This is a must-have for any bug report.

If you're not running a fairly recent fvwm2 (say 2.0.45 or above?) you
should consider getting a copy of the most recent 2.1.5 beta and see if
that helps.

No, you need to use the "followup" command in your mailer to send to all
recipients, instead of the "reply" command to send only to the author.
"Followup" will send to fvwm-workers, since it's on the CC line.

Certainly if Dominik never wanted to receive private replies he could
set his reply-to, but people sending patches, etc. should reply to the
list regardless.

No.  Or rather, majordomo can be configured that way, of course, but  it
is The Wrong Thing To Do.

Use the xsession program to start your window manager. This allows you
to stop and start the WM, or start a different WM, from an X application
without quitting X. I couldn't live without it!

I've successfully built fvwm-2.1.5 on a linux platform but on my
HP-UX machine the build fails. Same problem with 2.1.4. My previous
version was 2.0.45.

% cat config.cache
# This file is a shell script that caches the results of configure
# tests run on this system so they can be shared between configure
# scripts and configure runs.  It is not useful on other systems.
# If it contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit
it.
#
# By default, configure uses ./config.cache as the cache file,
# creating it if it does not exist already.  You can give configure
# the --cache-file=FILE option to use a different cache file; that is
# what configure does when it calls configure scripts in
# subdirectories, so they share the cache.
# Giving --cache-file=/dev/null disables caching, for debugging
configure.
# config.status only pays attention to the cache file if you give it the
# --recheck option to rerun configure.

...the patch reducing the number of colours used by pixmaps. Does
anyone know what the problem is ? Any help greatly appreciated.

Hi,
This patch (166 lines, but can't be helped) fixes the signal handling in
FvwmPager. It will now exit cleanly when it receives either a TERM, INT,
QUIT, PIPE or HUP signal.

Cheers,
Chris.

Followup sends two copies to the originator, one directly and one via
the list.  Most of my list activity is in USENET, so I'm used to
sending followup to the newsgroup only.  The originator should get a
direct copy only if they explicitly request it.

I suppose that the solution is for the mailer to recognize mailing
lists and remove the author from the followup recipients, unless
followup & reply has been explicitly called for.

Wild guess: your xpm library is too old.

We still have a documentation bug open for this. We had a coredump
with Xpm-4.7 and none with Xpm-4.11. What is your version number?

It looks to me like your XPM installation is bad; that error usually
means that that type (XpmImage) is unknown.  It's supposed to be defined
in xpm.h, which your configure output says you have?  Maybe you have an
old version?

My xpm.h has this for versions and works fine:

  #define XpmFormat 3
  #define XpmVersion 4
  #define XpmRevision 8

Do you have an xpm.h in /users/pds/X11R5/include/X11 ?
How did you invoke configure?

Right, but this isn't USENET :)

I agree it would be nice to have the ability to follow up only to the
non-From addresses... I wonder if Gnus has that?  I'll have to look!

I typically just remove any addresses from the header that I don't want,
by hand.  It just takes a second in Emacs.

Well, it would be nice if _majordomo_ was smart enough to canonicalize
the To and CC fields, including mailing list expansion, so everyone got
just one copy.  That would be the Right Thing, I think.

What is an "Xpm-4.11"? 

The xpm home page as documented in the FAQ points to;

http://www.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html

The most recent version on ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/
is xpm-3.4k (march 19th) which we have installed.

Huh?  I changed it myself and tested it before posting the announcement.
Perhaps a reload is in order?  Or at least a pointer to exactly on what
page an incorrect pointer lies?

Hi,
This patch fixes the signal handling in FvwmIconMan and tells the module
to exit when it receives a DestroyNotify event. Previously it was left
running as a sort of "undead" module.

Chris.

If we know which versions are bad (or alternatively, the lowest "known
good" version) we can probably easily construct a configure test for it.

Ignore the 3 which is the XpmFormat number

The version number is XpmVersion 4 and the k gives XpmRevision 11
(any higher than k and I'll need to take my shoes and socks off to
count). Read the top of your xpm.h file.

We have HP machines around here. I can try this out.

I did, but someone had overwritten it with an old version which was xpm
format 2, when they installed some other program. Having now put back an
xpm format 3 xpm.h in my include directory it's compiled OK. You were
spot on Paul, thanks very much for the help.

Hi,
This (unfortunately largish but unshrinkable) patch against
FvwmButtons.c will fix the signal handling and the error-handler so that
FvwmButtons will clean up after itself when it quits and will not die
horribly if you kill one of its buttons.

Chris.

We are still left with user unfriendly output discovered too late.

I notice that we check for the file "xpm.h" during configure, but
never try to #include it.

I'm  still not totally up  to speed on autoconf,  but wouldn't it make
more  sense  to change the  xpm  sensing logic to  use  the header and
actually  include  an "XpmImage *"  in the  little sample program that
configure uses?

Here is a snippet from the configure.in file from a recent XEmacs (21.0)
release.  I'm no expert in autoconf, but I hope this helps.

This patch fixes the signal handling on fvwm2 so that it can clean-up
after itself without risking reentrancy problems. Send it two signals in
very rapid succession and it will just throw up its hands and exit
without cleaning up, but it shouldn't core-dump so that should be OK
too.

Cheers.
Chris.

Ah, good; this is exactly what I meant when I said we could "add a check
into configure".

Now, is our requirement for xpm the same as XEmacs' (looks like they
want at least 3.4f)?  Do we need something later?  Will an earlier
release work?

I can add this check for now and we can adjust later, I suppose.

I think it's still a mystery, which is why  I favored an approach that
attempted  to test the functionality  we  need rather  than a  release
number.  Of course, it is  true, when we are  all done, a message that
says "you need  a release > than ???",  is better than a message  that
just says your xpm library doesn't work.

I know that 3.4j (4.10) works.

Hi,
My signal handling strategy has "evolved" slightly over the course of
today. What I have here is as bulletproof as I can make it.

The question is, is _any_ xpm.h that contains XpmImage good enough?  I
thought there were issues even with some later, but not late enough,
versions of Xpm.

Hello,

With a former release (2.0.45), I had :

EdgeResistance 250 50
EdgeScroll 0 0

This allows me :
- to switch from one page to another by moving a window across border of
screen
- to NOT have automatic scrolling when mouse reaches border of screen.

With fvwn 2.1.45, this behaviour seems to be impossible despite the man
page:

	  Note that, with "EdgeScroll 0 0", it is still  possible
          to  move  or  resize  windows  across  the  edge of the
          current screen.   By  making  the  first  parameter  to
          EdgeResistance 10000 this type of motion is impossible.
          With EdgeResistance less than 10000 but greater than  0
          moving over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.

This behaviour was very useful for new users. I use Solaris 2.5.1

  There's an old article (Jan '97) in the mailing-list archive about
specifying a *Page* for a window (a la 'StartsOnDesk', but
'StartsOnPage'). There didn't seem to be any response - does anyone know
how to achieve this?

  I set my NetScape window to come up in page (1,0) by adding the
screen-width to its default geom., which worked (when spawning a browser
window from (0,0) ... but if I spawn one /from/ (1,0), it comes up in
(2,0) - D'Oh!

In versions 2.1.x you can use StartsOnPage d x y,
d is the desk
x is page across
y is page down
the d or the x y is optional
with no d current desk is used 
with no x y works like StartsOnDesk

I was very happy to find this feature which was high in my wish list,
but I am a bit disappointed because it doesn't work very well.

I try to use:

Style "Netscape*"	SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 0 1 0

with an InitFunction which starts Netscape with option -iconic.

It fails, Netscape always starts on Page 0 0 0 :=(
But it works without -iconic option.

I think also that both options StartsOnPage and StartsOnDesk could be
grouped together in a single option.

We have a bug report for this already. I think this is caused
by configure. Sometimes it looks as if it doesn't recognize
that you have the xpm library and turn the xpm option off.
I had it myself but could not recreate it. Try to restart
configure and put the output into a file. If that happens
again, please post the configure output.

Paul (PDS), you were looking into this anyway, can you
tell what's going on in the configure scrript?

I've had this happen to me, also.

I found out the cause...  for some reason, the XPM library isn't found
unless you use the --with-xpm-library= and --with-xpm-includes=
parameters on the configure script (that is, if the XPM library isn't
in the standard include location).

For example, if your XPM library and includes are in /usr/local, then
it won't be found unless you specify their locations explicitly.

I would guess that the logic to find XPM could be made a bit robust...

Hmm, when I had this it was enough to run configure again (??)

It always works OK for me.  So, I'd need someone to send me their
config.log file from a configure that doesn't work right.

I'll add some text to configure to print a summary of the build options
at the end, then people might notice if pixmaps are not included.

I have a similar problem (see bug report message id 65) with edge
scroll.  

On my system, the edge scroll does work, but only going up or to the
left.  Since my setup automatically starts in the upper left "page",
it appears that edge scroll doesn't work at all, but when in a page
that has another page above or to the left of it, I can edgescroll in
that direction.  Moving windows across page boundaries also works in
only two of the four directions.  Please try all directions to see if
you are able to use some, but not all directions like I can.

This does NOT occur with our UltraSPARC machines running Solaris.
This also did NOT occur with fvwm 2.0.46.

This will sound quite stupid to some of you, but how do apply the patch
to the source? I know I should use the nice "patch" command, which read
from stdin, but I don't know which parameters it needs.

Thanks,

cd into the directory from which the patch was created (usually
the directory with the patched files but maybe something above
it if you have files in multiple directories) and then:

patch < foo.patch

where foo.patch is the name of the patch (plus path).

I've just lost my additions again, this time running 2.1.5 on a SparcStation 4
Solaris 2.5.1.  I still have no idea what causes it, I just go to open a new
window, and there's no menu there.  Included are my .fvwm2rc and .Xdefaults, 
complete with horrid colors that keep others from using my workstation.  The 
rc is the 1.x example, converted to 2.x with included script and modified to
my liking.

I  think you are trying  to tell us that  you are loosing  the 2 mouse
bindings above?

After you  open a new   window, the buttons  on  the root (background)
window, fail to popup menus?

If thats the case, try taking the string "Nop" off the line.
Reading the documentation, I don't see what thats supposed to do.

Well, Dan and I tried to reproduce it but cannot. Nothing will be done on
this subject anymore unless you post at least your EdgeSrcoll and
EdgeResistance lines.

Hi Chris,

the patch to FvwmIconMan has large conflicts when I try
to apply it to the current CVS code. Can you look into
this and create a new patch?

	The problem lies in code that is much older than the StartsOnPage
logic. FVWM bypasses any of the window placement logic (where StartsOnPage
operates) if the window has the wmhints initial_state properrty set to
IconicState. This is what happens when you use the -iconic command line
argument.

	I'm not quite sure what the reason for this was...perhaps to defer
the placement logic until the window is actualy mapped for the first time.
I see an inconsistencly in the handling that puzzles me, but it may give
you a temporary workaround. If you use the StartIconic style instead of
using the -iconic arg, it slips right on through the placement code and
ends up on the page where you wanted it.

	There's another quirk: the Desk component of the StartsOnPage spec
is honored even though the page isn't (technical reason - the desk has
nothing to do with what we might call the "page placement", which is
stricly a function of the x,y positions of the window, so the desktop
is set, but the relative positioning of the window is bypassed).

	I'll look into this as soon as I can, and see whether I can change
the old code without breaking something else. In the meantime, you might try
adding StartIconic to the Style spec for those windows you want started iconic
(you *do* also have to lose the -iconic arg when invoking the program - that's
what does the dirty work).

> I think also that both options StartsOnPage and StartsOnDesk could be
> grouped together in a single option.

	Consider StartsOnPage as a replacement for StartsOnDesk. As Brad
pointed out, it does both. Consider StartsOnDesk as being retained for
backward compatibility, and eligible to be removed in a future release.

No need to apologise--the patches were very instructive, and it's nice to
see some traffic around here :-) I'm impressed that you were able to clean
up the signal handling with so little code--when I was reading the bug
tracking reports, it looked like that was gonna be a doozy to fix.

I'm curious about the portability of using longjmp to get out of a signal
handler, though--don't some platforms use a seperate stack for signal
handlers? And do all current BSD systems possess sigaction?

	Well configure works fine for me. Between 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 I upgraded 
from Debian 1.3.1 to 2.0 and in the process the xpm libraries were uninstalled, 
don't know why. So I reinstalled the libc6 compatible one and now it's ok.
	Excuse me for the trouble.

Given that I can't reproduce this, I can only come up with theories,
not fixes.

In 2.1.x we changed the pan frame thickness from 2 to 1.

Edgescrolling works  because  fvwm2  creates  these invisible  windows
around the edges of  the  screen.  When the   mouse moves into  one of
these invisible windows and  stays there for the "EdgeResistance" time
period, a scroll takes place.

Perhaps some X Servers aren't happy with 1 pixel wide windows.

Mark, could you try changing PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS from 1 back to 2
in fvwm.h, re-compile and retest?

As I remember, the change from 2 to 1 was for FvwmTaskbar?

Yes it was to get the TaskBars AutoHide to work.  It's more important to
get page scrolling to work than keeping AutoHide working, so don't worry
about breaking it.

I'm not sure FvwmTaskBar has a long term future, it's only unique
features seems to be the window title tips and the ability to not show
transients.  Everthing else can be mangled with FvwmButtons,
FvwmIconMan, xclock, xbiff and FvwmEvent (for autohiding). FvwmIconMan
could do with some work eventually and I'd like to put tips into it
then.

Cheers,
Tim.

Wow you nailed it!  Thank-you very much.  It would've taken me aeons
to find that one.

It looks like my cursor arrow doesn't get all the way to the edge
before it's motion is limited.  Perhaps this is an X Server bug.

One amazing thing was that I didn't have to exit X to test it out.
Much to my surprise restart fvwm was able to load the newly updated
executable.

Hi,
I have had a few questions about the changes I have made to the signal
handling. People are primarily concerned with the portability of POSIX.1
signals, especially concerning older systems. So, as a matter of market
research, can anyone whose system does NOT support any of the following
functions please email me at "rankinc@bellsouth.net", describing the
signal functions that your system does support?

sigaction
sigprocmask
sigemptyset
sigaddset
sigsetjmp
siglongjmp

I think that most people should have sigaction: if people are just
missing signal-mask/set functionality then I might be able to make
POSIX-looking wrappers around whatever masking functions you do have -
provided I know what's available to work with (and know the #defines
which describe your system) ... :-)

Cheers,
Chris.

I'm curious if the Pan Frame still has its old side-effects...  If so,
it would be very helpful to be able to turn off those features.

I still use 2.0.46, but I modified a few things which bothered me.  In
the distrib version, clicking inside the Pan Frame would bring up the
root-window menus, regardless of what was actually under the cursor.  I
fixed this by changing PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS to 0.  (this causes several
startup errors, but they don't seem to matter)  Does the new version
still have this behavior?  Is there a runtime option to turn it off?

The other annoying behavior which I "fixed" was the original topic.  It
now allows mouse-scrolling only if the user is dragging a window over
the edge.  Toying with the sources wasn't the best way to change this,
but it works...  :)

A previous post said something about using 10000 instead of 100 in the
config file, to affect this...  The man page says that using an
EdgeScroll of 100 * scroll_value just lets scrolling "wrap" around
Desktop edges, though (very handy...  :).  Does the man page leave
something out, or am I confusing two things?

It does for me.  2.1.5 with the PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS set to 2 produces
a root menu when Left Mouse Button clicking on the edge of the frame
even with some window underneath that would normally produce some
other reaction to an LMB click.

However, it not very consistent.  Going to the left or up, I don't get
this effect.  Going right or down, it does.  Note that these last two
directions were the same direction that failed to edge scroll for me
when PAN_FRAME_THICKNESS was set to 1.  Also, the root menu
decorations (DGradient in my case) do not appear in this context.

I don't consider these to be real problems because they never appear
on their own and I have to go out of my way to see if I can make them
occur.

I can edge scroll with the mouse alone or while dragging a window.

Whether the pan frame  is 1 or  2, if you  click on  a window  that is
under  the pan frame,  you are still clicking  on the pan frame, which
fvwm2 treats as the root.

Seems like what you want is a command:

EdgeScroll off

or maybe you just want a high edgeresistance to kill the pan frames.

If I follow you, the later.

I am under the impression that "siglongjmp" is a variant *explicitly*
designed to be called from within a signal handler. Such
implementation details as switching stacks should be handled
internally by the system. Therefore if it has "siglongjmp", it should
work. Plain "longjmp" has no such guarantee.

> And do all current BSD systems possess sigaction?

That's a good question. I had assumed that POSIX 1 was prevalent in
the modern UNIX world. I have programmed on Linux, HPUX, Solaris and
AIX and all these platforms have provided POSIX 1.

There is an alternative *but less robust* way of improving the signal
handling that involves having a "static volatile sig_atomic_t
isDeadPipe" variable, which is set to "True" within the signal
handler. This approach wouldn't need to block other signals since
multiple handlers could set the variable to True as often as they
wished. The point of the variable would be to control the event loop
so that "while (1) { ... }" would become "while ( !isDeadPipe )
{ ... }". The problem with this approach is that it's less responsive
unless you preface every call which could block with "if
(!isDeadPipe)":

Consider: a signal arrives just AFTER checking isDeadPipe in the main
event loop but BEFORE the call to My_XNextEvent(). Or possibly a signal
arrives in My_XNextEvent() before the call to select(). The isDeadPipe
variable suddenly becomes True, but the process blocks anyway and
needs another signal or something to free it. This is why I took the
siglongjmp approach - it FORCES the termination issue.

If anyone has a system that does NOT have POSIX 1 support (bear in
mind that POSIX 1 support may not appear until you #define
_POSIX_SOURCE) can they speak now, please?

Chris.

Hello,

I would like to know how I can configure the default configuration
file for Fvwm2 under Red Hat 5.0. I have tried copying my ~/.fvwm2rc
to the global system.fvwm2rc file but that alone did not work.

I don't want to have to place a dotfile in /etc/skel or in the users' home
directory and I want fvwm2 to run by default (instead of Kde etc...)
when a user logs in.

How do I do this?

Thanks in advance,

Neil

I recently built a 2.1.6 version from CVS.

I noticed that my root menu requires a relatively long hold time
(about a half second) on a menu item before it'll work.  Don't
know what is going on with that; anyone else see this?  Title-bar
buttons seem to work fine with a short click.

Thanks,

First of all, I have RedHat 5.2, so there may be some differences, but I
think 5.0 (which I had briefly before 5.2) was similar. At least it also
used fvwm2 by default.

I suggest you begin at the beginning, namely by studying
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and then everything it triggers directly or
indirectly. I'll give a brief summary of what happens with 5.2 (default
setup) in case your situation is similar:

1. xinitrc invokes Xclients (same directory).
2. That checks for ~/.wm_style and invokes /usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM --Fvwm95
   Note this is a script which you can look at.
3. This (if it doesn't find ~/.fvwm2rc.m4, invokes fvwm2 in m4 mode
using the command:
   fvwm2 -cmd FvwmM4 -debug /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4
   You won't see that literally, but if you evaluate the relevant
variables, that's what you're 
   getting. Also, if you do a ps after things are running, you will see
the complete command.
4. Since you are at this point running fvwm2 in its m4 mode, if you want
to stick with 
   that, you should learn a bit of the m4 macro language (info m4).
Anyway, if you study
   /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4, you will see that it reads in a
whole slew of m4 include files 
   which are also in /etc/X11/AnotherLevel. 

So if you are basically going to keep the AnotherLevel multi-file
structure in place, then what you want to do as sysadmin is edit those
m4 files in /etc/X11/AnotherLevel. Of course you don't have to use this
scheme at all. You can rewrite /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and do anything
you want, including running fvwm2 in its non-m4 
mode, where everything is handled through a single configuration file
and you can forget about learning m4.

> I don't want to have to place a dotfile in /etc/skel or in the users' home

Of course some of your users may want to customize things for
themselves. If so, again assuming the AnotherLevel scheme is maintained,
they would copy the files from /etc/X11/AnotherLevel as for example,
~/.fvwm2rc.defines (note: initial '.' added, final '.m4' removed).
However, if they want to write their own replacement for the top-level
m4 file, they copy it to the name ~/.fvwm2rc.m4, *with* the '.m4'
suffix. This inconsistency is annoying and something it took me a while
to uncover. However, typical user customizations would be in the
subsidiary files. One other thing: A lot of the menu configuration is
done using wmconfig on the fly. So some of the menu content is set up
via the files in /etc/X11/wmconfig. Users can customize this by having
~/.wmconfig and creating files there for custom menu items. In short,
the default RedHat 5.2 setup has window manager configuration splattered
all over the place.

I'd noticed that, and it seemed consistent so I built my whole .fvwm2rc
around it. With numlock off most function keys etc have been assigned
handy actions. With numlock on all keys go straight to whatever's
running in the current window.

This way of working has become addictive, so I do hope it's not just a
quirk. Can anyone confirm it's supposed to be so? Could another key be
used for this purpose instead, in order to leave the numlock on all the
time?

42) Why do NumLock and CapsLock interfere with ClickToFocus and/or my

A: Because they are treated as modifiers.

Ooooh, so that means key bindings too does it?
Thanks. I live and learn :-)

When I saw this a while ago I tried to fiddle with the CapsLock and
couldn't see what it does. Is there any other documentation on this?

Please answer only to the list (you copied Bob but he's already on the
list).

You  might want to  start  with "man xmodmap".   This  is not an fvwm2
issue, fvwm2 treats keyboard events like any other X application.

Well this seems to help...

I reversed the action of the num-lock key by running the
following commands through xmodmap.  So when Num-Lock is off, the
numerals are produced; and when Num-Lock is on, the
Home/arrows/Page ones work.

keysym KP_Home = KP_7 KP_Home
keysym KP_Up = KP_8 KP_Up
keysym KP_Prior = KP_9 KP_Prior
keysym KP_Left = KP_4 KP_Left
keysym KP_Begin = KP_5 KP_Begin
keysym KP_Right = KP_6 KP_Right
keysym KP_End = KP_1 KP_End
keysym KP_Down = KP_2 KP_Down
keysym KP_Next = KP_3 KP_Next
keysym KP_Insert = KP_0 KP_Insert
keysym KP_Delete = KP_Decimal KP_Delete

No.  Any window larger than 2000 pixels will cause your CRT to think it
is in the early 20th century and it will therefore only display a tiny
flickering monochrome image.

Use the source Luke,
Tim.

Hi,

I've only just started using FVWM and I'm trying to get my bearings. I have
two questions at the moment:

1) I love the FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS thing. But the scripts that I want to
write for them need to query fvwm for things like window sizes and
locations, viewport location, and so on. How can I get access to that data?

2) How can I set up keybindings to resize an active window without doing any
mouse dragging or requiring the mouse to be in any particular location?

I'd like to thank the developers for making a really great program.

Zack

Hello,

How many times did you end up with the mouse off the mousepad and had to 
lift the mouse to regain a hold of the pointer?

Well, I think it's time for a hack that does the following:

Pressing a key freezes the pointer. While the key is depressed you can
move the mouse freely and the pointer won't move. When you release the 
key the mouse regains power over the pointer. That way you don't have to
lift the mouse off the mousepad to regain control.

In fact, if you have 4 or more adjacent virtual desktops then chances are
that you do have to lift the mouse lost of times while using your computer.
Things get even worse when dust gets on the wheels of the sphere beneath
the mouse and the pointer starts moving bizzarely.

It't time for a new hack.

Best Regards,

Neil

I don't think the window manager is the place to do this.  The window
manager would have to keep warping the pointer back everytime it moved
in this mode.  The X server is the place to do it.

It's time for a Cirque Glidepoint(tm) or a retinal tracking system.

Try:
    Fvwm send_windowlist

For more info on flags

    Fvwm -i3 send_windowlist

You can add a function to do resizing and moving. Then, bind a key to the
function. If you need more control flow, or size calculation and such, 
bind a key to a shell script. You can call FvwmCommand to do the
actual window operation in the script.

Hey there,

I have looked through the man pages extensively, and haven't found any
references to being able to stretch pixmaps, like in the titlebar.  Is
there any way to do this?  If not, I think it is a feature that is
really needed.

Thanks,

My first reaction was,  "Oh no, not more bloat!".    Then I looked  in
rxvt to see how it's done there:

        temp=XCreatePixmap(Xdisplay,TermWin.vt,
                           szHint.width,orig_att.height,
                           DefaultDepth(Xdisplay,0));
        gc=XCreateGC(Xdisplay,TermWin.vt,(unsigned long)0,&gcvals);
        ox=0;
        for(rx=0;rx<szHint.width;rx++) {
          XCopyArea(Xdisplay,orig_pixmap,temp,gc,
                    (int)ox,0,1,orig_att.height,rx,0);
          ox+=((double)orig_att.width/(double)szHint.width);
        }
        ox=0;
        for(rx=0;rx<szHint.height;rx++) {
          XCopyArea(Xdisplay,temp,bg_pixmap,gc,
                    0,(int)ox,szHint.width,1,0,rx);
          ox+=((double)orig_att.height/(double)szHint.height);
        }

Only  the code starting at "XCreateGC"  is additional.  I  left in the
"XCreatePixmap" to give some context.  Not really that bad.

Right now, the only things going into fvwm2 are changes that will help
us release a stable 2.2.  After that, who knows?

You might consider entering an enhancement request thru Jitterbug.

Of course, patches are better than requests.

Hello,

fvwm2 is VERY interesting. I've used it and loved it. However, I was wondering
if fvwm will be KDE compliant and GNOME compliant. Just wondering is all =)

I'm running fvwm2 on my Red Hat 5.1 (Toshiba laptop) Linux.  The virtual
workspace
window won't unstick...when I go to a full screen display program
(Netscape, WordPerfect)
the little workspace window stays on top.  I've mucked with the Sticky
and StaysOnTop settings
but with no luck.  Any hints about how to hide it?

Thanks!

configure has a problem finding the xpm library when it is
not in the expected place. You have to tell configure the
path manually (try configure --help).

It is still there but it probably hasn't been compiled into your copy. 
The configure script used to generate the make files probably need the
--with-xpm-includes=PATH --with-xpm-library=DIR args given to it.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi,

When I start X and FVWM, the pager displays a grid whose elements are the
same size as the viewport. I would like this grid to represent things that
are more meaningful for my desktop set-up, such as the distance the viewport
jumps when I press certain hotkeys. Is the grid configurable?

Huh? We have a communications problem here. If the grid elements
were as large as the viewport the pager would cover the entire
scree. That is probably not what you want to say. So here is what
the pager (FvwmPager I assume) does:

For the specified range of desks it displays a mini-representation
of the configured pages. You can switch desks or pages via the pager
by clicking in it. The number of desks is given on the command line
for FvwmPager:

  Module FvwmPager 4 9

will give you six desks numbered from 4 to 9. Each desk has the
same grid size specified by

  DeskSize x y

Each grid rectangle represents a page, the dashed lines in between
are the page boundaries. If you want to change the size of the
grid you have to change the number of pages on your desktop.

Does this answer your question?

Bye

I know there is a group working on GNOME compliance (I don't have the URL
offline but if you do a search at http://freshmeat.net for fvwm2gnome it
should show up). I don't know about KDE compliance, the KDE people seemed to
have concentrated on kwm rather than making window managers in general work
nicely with KDE and so integrating it will probably be more difficult. I
would like to see it though, fvwm could provide a bridge between the GNOME
and KDE environments. Perhaps the module interface could be extended to
allow for "desktop environment integration" modules.

Sorry, I was daydreaming, what were you saying? Oh yes, look up fvwm2gnome.

	I think what Zack wants to be able to do is to set the units
of the grid to an arbitrary value. Say he has a 1280 x 1024 screen,
and has hotkeys that will jump half of the desktop dimension in
either direction - 640 sideways or 512 up or down. I think he'd like
the pager to display a grid of squares *representing* 640 x 512 chunks
of desktop real estate instead of pages.

	Despite the puzzlement, Dominik's reply is correct. FVWM
manages the virtual desktop in multiples of the actual screen size,
and that's what the Pager displays. That's why it's called the, um,
Pager. It's not configurable to use arbitrary grid units.

I think so, but it doesn't solve my problem. You see, the grid of dashed
lines may have the purpose of identifying individual pages, but I want to
use them for a different purpose. I want to tell FvwmPager exactly where to
place those dashed lines, regardless of page-boundaries.

But if I understand you correctly, those lines are hard-coded to the page
boundaries. Correct?

Hello!

As I read from doc modifiers are: control, shift, lock, meta, mod1-mod5 
or all (CSML12345A).
So if we want to obtain the same behaviour with or without Num etc.
we must define additional bindings i.e. :

# without additional modifiers
Key Escape      A       S       PopUp Window-Ops

# with NumLock
Key Escape      A       S2      PopUp Window-Ops

#with CapsLock
Key Escape      A       SL      PopUp Window-Ops

.. the same with mouse bindings.

Regards

  Well, I'm now trying to use this, ... and it /doesn't/ seem to work. It
gets the Netscape stuff on the right page if one removes '-iconic', but
the StartsIconic style fails, and both Navigator & MailThread kick off in
open windows:


Style "*"  SloppyFocus, SkipMapping
Style "MailThread"  StartIconic, IconBox 941 0 -157 -846
Style "Navigator"   StartIconic, IconBox 941 0 -157 -846, StartsOnPage 0 1
0

...   toolwait netscape -ncols 128 -mail file:$HOME/.www/index.html


  I've had to put, after the toolwait (in my kick-off-apps script):

   FvwmCommand 'Function Iconify-Netscape'   2>&1  > /dev/null

with:

AddToFunc Iconify-Netscape  \
   "I" Wait MailThread
+  "I" Next [MailThread] Iconify 1
+  "I" Next [Navigator]  Iconify 1


  Not pleasant [you see the mailthread window momentarily] but it works.

  Well, I got it working, finally. I had to hack configure to force it to
not clear the xpm_*  (and rplay/readline) things so that they were
actually compiled in. *Nothing* I tried made it worked automatically -
nomatter the options/settings I made, it'd find the lib*.a file, but then
fail the final (.h?) "it's there" test [that's the bit I commented out].

Sorry something doesn't work for mouse bindings.
Type A (All) works fine with CapsLock but with NumLock it fails.
Why?

I observed that:
+ while in ClickToFocus mode and no modifiers while I click in my iconify
  button inactive widow is activated, raised and button is in pressed
state  - releasing mouse activate iconification;
- with CapsLock the same click activates and raises window but
iconification is not invoked, second click does it

- with NumLock iconification is activated but window is not activated nor
raised.

Mouse binding is:
Mouse 0 4 A Iconify

Is that correct behaviour?

It doesn't? I'll check that in the code.

There is like no one in this week, being so close to christmas, so I'm
bored and trying to configure fvwm more to my liking.  I run the newest
ver. on Solaris 2.5.1 on My sparc 5.  My video card kinda blows (CG6
with 1M video memory), so I'm limited as to how much I can run.  Anyway,
quick question for everyone:  How can I just change the window border
colors from what I guess is 'stock' (its grey non in focus, and in-focus
is this weird pink sort of color).  I know if I made pixmaps I could do
it, but I just want to change them to standard (albeit different) rgb
colors.  Doable?

Of course. For the focussed window you can use

  HilightColors <textcolour> <backbroundcolour>

For all other windows it can be defined per window:

  Style "*" ForeColor <forecolour>, BackColor <backcolor>

If you mean 2.1.5 with 'the newest ver.' you need not put
the asterisk in double quotes. You might want to read the
'Style' section in the manpage for more options.

	As Dominik mentioned, this has been corrected in the CVS repository
for a few days. If you don't have CVS access, unfortunately, you'll have
to wait till the next tarball is cut.

Linux 2 (RH 5.1).

I have a line in .fvwm2rc that is this:

*FvwmButtons(Padding 4 8, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill,Respawn,NoHints) \
    asmodem 'Exec asmodem -s -d "/usr/sbin/pppd call worldnet" -h /usr/sbin/ppp-off -r "wavplay $HOME/Sounds/deadcat.wav"')

(Sorry for the long line.  Can quoted commands be broken as well?)

The options mean 
   -s "shaped" graphic for the modem picture
   -d use the quoted command to dial the ISP
   -h use the quoted command to hang up
   -r use the quoted command if reset

In fvwm 2.0.45, when hanging up, the icon would disappear and reappear
on the button bar just as I would expect.

In 2.1.4 and 2.1.5, the button bar disappears, then the asmodem icon
reappears in the upper left part of the screen.  If I restart FvwmButtons,
the button bar swallows the existing app just fine.

Ideas?

I just recompiled fvwm2 on my debian system and now FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS
don't work. I put them in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/ and made links from them
to /usr/local/bin, which I think is at least part of what I did last time,
but now when I give an FvwmCommand like "-i2 send window_list", I just get
back:

Hi,

After just loading fvwm2 with pager , I see that 150 colors were allocated !!!
in .fvwm2rc I see only 2 references of colors, and I have added 
ColorLimit 60

So, where did all the color go?
What can I do to reduce the colors of fvwm?

I am using fvwm2 (2.0.46-11) as comes bundled with Red Hat 2.5.
I have a problem where many of my mini-icons are not being
displayed.  A few are, but most aren't.  For example, my
.fvwm2rc file contains:

AddToMenu "Utilities" "Utilities" Title
+ "Top%mini-run.xpm%"                   Exec rxvt -font 7x14 -T Top -n
Top -e top &
+ "Calculator%mini-calc.xpm%"           Exec xcalc &
+ "Manual pages%mini-book1.xpm%"        Exec xman &
+ "Magnifying glass%mini-zoom.xpm%"     Exec xmag &
+ "Oclock%mini-clock.xpm%"              Exec oclock &
+ ""                                    Nop
+ "Applications%mini-x2.xpm%"           Popup Applications
+ "Shells%mini-term.xpm%"               Popup Shells
+ "Games%mini-happy.xpm%"               Popup Games
+ ""                                    Nop

Out of these eight items, I only get icons for three of them:
top, magnifying glass and Oclock.  The other ones have no icon 
and instead include the literal string above i.e.

Calculator%mini-calc.xpm%

I have verified that the named files do exist in 
/usr/share/icon/mini, which is defined in the PixmapPath
variable.  I can view these icon files with xv.  

Any clues what would cause an icon not to be displayed?  I have 
read the FAQ and perused the mailing list archives and can't find
any similar messages.

I am not sure what other info to provide about my environment.
I am running on an NCD X-term which gets served by my linux
box via xdm.

Thanks in advance for any advice.
-Robin

hi,

	I am sure I am missing something very obvious, but please bear with
me. What was Circulate[Up/Down] of fvwm replaced with. The FAQ talks about
Next and Prev, and that they are incompatible. So what is compatible?

	If you want me to be more specific, how do I replace the fvwm1 line:
Key Tab A M CirculateUp
in a .fvwm2rc and get the same affect.

I am using fvwm-2.1.5/Solaris 2.6. There was a mention in the announcement
about win95-type alt-tab ....

tia,
syam.

PS: cde sucks. has alt-tab though.

not quite. I have SloppyFocus and it works only when the pointer at the
right place (basically the old window does not lose keyboard focus). So
while the above solution is okay for the time, I would like a more complete
solution.

The man page has something to say about this.  Don't you think
you should mention the fvwm release you are using?

The icon label width is the same as the icon's width.
Currently the icons are not clipped to any size, they display at
their built-in size.  There has been some discussion about changing
this.

You need to put "ColorLimit 60" before your first use of any pixmap
in your .fvwm2rc.  If you have done this, how many colors is fvwm2 using
now?

You want to make sure you are not using gradients anywhere.

Well, I don't have any gradients, and I put all the colors (including *Back and 
*Fore) in the .fvwm2rc in comments.  I puy the ColorLimit before any use of pixm
ap .  
I saved only 2 colors.

So, what shall I do?

  Hello,

   I'm not sure whether the StackingOrder patch is in any of the recent
releases, so I would like to make a request on behalf of people that have
many windows (I usually have 30+) on top of each other and want to switch
from pane to pane via something like "scroll +100 +0".

   Without the StackingOrder patch it *takes ages* to switch, since every
window gets displayed before the switch.

   With StackingOrder patch the switch is immediate.

   I've had no problems with the patch ever, so I would consider it stable
enough to be included in a release.

   The patch can be found at ftp://ftp.ied.com:/pub/StackingOrder.patch


     Thank you all developers for such a great WM !

	Jan, the StackingOrder patch is definitely *in*. I don't remember
exactly when we folded it into the development sources, but it is in the
current beta, and, of course, it will be in 2.2, er, Real Soon Now.

	I've neglected to update my Unofficial Patches page - I ought to
do that soon. The StartsOnPage and the DontFocusOffscreen patches from
that source are also in the current beta, lest you might be wondering.

What tool are you using to show the number of colors allocated?

When do you actually loose the colors?

Start fvwm2, but don't start any other programs or modules.  How many
colors are allocated?  Start other things you use, including the Pager
one at a time until you see an unreasonable number of colors allocated.

smr-2.0.46.4

I know the man page says that this error means FvwmCommandS is not loaded. I
didn't misunderstand the error message, I just can't get the error message
to go away. As far as I can tell, I have the files properly installed, and I
invoke it properly in the rc file ("Module FvwmCommandS" on a line by itself
at the top of the file without the quotes), but FvwmCommandS just isn't
loading.

I would really appreciate help on this, because as far as I know, I did
everything right. I don't know what else to do. I've tried running FvwmTalk
and loading the FvwmCommandS module by hand, but it just fails. Is there any
way to see the error message from FvwmTalk? I just don't know what to do. I
tried giving no path, giving the full path, nothing works.

(I know my version is a little out of date, but I'm using a patched version
of fvwm2 and the patch hasn't been done for the latest version. I doubt the
patch is the problem, though, because someone else got FvwmCommandS to work
even with the same patched version. Unfortunately he hasn't been able to get
it to work on my system. We're both stumpted.)

Hi,

It seems that my .xinitrc was doing some unnecessary work and did took about 140
colors, so everything is ok now, and after loading all modules I consumed only a
bout 20 colors.

Thanks,

Yossi

Is it fair to say that the correct problem statement is "FvwmCommandS"
exits prematurely?

If so, I seem to remember this being fixed sometime during the 2.1.x
beta series.

You can either try to debug this in your patched 2.0.46, or try out
the latest beta.  It is possible that the 2.1.x FvwmCommand will work
with your patched 2.0.46.

 FvwmCommand comes with the original 2.0.46 distribution needs a
patch. 
 What is smr, anyway?

You can see error messages in a couple different ways. Running
FvwmConsole or invoking fvwm2 with redirection such as 
fvwm2 2>/tmp/fvwm.err".

Hi,

I got the latest 2.1.5 version from the official web site, compiled it and
did a make install in the fvwm2.1.5/ directory, the fvwm2.1.5/modules, and
the fvwm2.1.5/extras directories.

No matter what I do, FvwmCommandS still won't load. I've tried putting it in
the ~/.fvwm2rc file, loading it from FvwmTalk, and FvwmConsole. 

Redirecting the output of fvwm2 only says "FvwmCommandS: dead pipe"

I'm using vanilla Debian slink, with no fvwm* packages installed.

Zack

This usually happens when another FvwmCommandS is already running with
same fifos you just tried to run. 
Then, it should take FvwmCommand...

Can you confirm that you don't have stray FvwmCommandS by 'ps -ax' or
something like that? It doesn't make much sense but...

I haven't tried neither fvwm2.1.X nor slink. Anybody?

There seems to be some kind of bug in the Smart placement code.  The placement
of windows gets messed up if there is an iconized window with no icon.  To
demonstrate, try this.  Add this to the end of your .fvwm2rc or via FvwmTalk:

Style "*" NoIcon 
GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

Now make your desktop mostly empty.  Start some program and iconize it, then
start a second copy.  It should appear right where the first one did, but
instead it will appear at some other odd place.

The fvwm2 code is really a mess to me, but the problem looks like the function
test_fit in placement.c

There is some code that does this:

    if((testw->flags & ICONIFIED)&&
       (testw->icon_w)) {
       if(testw->flags & ICON_UNMAPPED)
         continue;
      ... stuff with icon position ...
    } else {
      ... stuff with window position ...
    }

It looks like iconified windows with no icon will take the branch that uses
the window position for calculations.  Here is a patch that seems to have
fixed it for me.


diff fvwm-2.1.5/fvwm/placement.c fvwm-2.1.5.new/fvwm/placement.c

Hello,

I asked before and got very little feedback.

If you have Red Hat you will realize that the solution to this problem

is not the same as for other distributions of Linux.

So, how do I have fvwm2 read the system.fvwm2rc that *I* create so that

all users use that very file???

I *do not* want to place a .fvwm2rc file in *every* single user's directory.

If you know the solution to this problem then please write back,

Thanks a lot,

I appreciate your help,

Neil

Well, perhaps it comforts you that I've see *much* worse code.

Looks right to me. I'll apply the patch soon.

BTW, when you create a patch next time, please use the
-c or -u options to diff (contextual/unified diff). Simple
diffs cannot be applied automatically by the patch program
and I tend to make a typo even with cut-and-paste.

Thanks

I don't, so I can only guess.

What is your problem? One of these?

1) You can't find the system wide fvwm2rc

2) You know where it is but want to use another file
   without touching it?

If 2) is your problem I suppose it would be best to rename
the existing file and use your own instead.

If 1) is the problem, try running fvwm2 with strace:

  # strace -eopen fvwm2

This gives you a trace of all open() kernel calls. One of
these will be the system wide fvwm2rc file.

Basically you should have a look at the system wide
xinitrc file too.

Bye

Dominik

I'm trying to build fvwm-2.1.5 but I don't have a C++ compiler, is a C++
compiler necessary to build it?

Thanks,

No.  There are some things in the extras directory that need C++.
Do "./configure --help" to see how to skip them.

This is a new builtin function I wrote back for fvwm-2.0.43.  I modified it so
it would work with the new fvwms and thought I would re-submit it.  This
patches applies to fvwm-2.1.6.

Here is the man page entry for the function:

       Replace [ Anim ]
              Causes  the current window's position to be re-com-
              puted using the  initial  window  placement  logic.
              Basically,  the  window  is moved to where it would
              have been if it were a new  window  that  had  just
              appeared.    Most   useful  with  Smart  or  Clever
              (ReallySmart) placement.  If the optional  argument
              Anim  is  specified,  an  animated  move is used to
              place the window in its new position.
