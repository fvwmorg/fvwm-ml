For this case, the easiest is probably to use the builtin capabilities
of FvwmButtons.  From the FvwmButtons manpage:

         Action [(options)] command
              Specifies an fvwm command to be executed  when  the
              button  is  activated by pressing return or a mouse
              button. If command contains whitespace it  must  be
              quoted. The current options are:

              Mouse  n  -  this action is only executed for mouse
              button n.  One actions  can  be  defined  for  each
              mouse button, in addition to the general action.

So, it's as easy as:

*FvwmButtons(Title "Foo", Icon foo.xpm, \
             Action(Mouse 1) "xmessage Button 1 was clicked.", \
             Action(Mouse 2) "xmessage Button 2 was clicked.", \
             Action(Mouse 3) "xmessage Button 3 was clicked.")

Hello all.  I would like to thank the maintainer for providing
this forum for fvwm users.  It is a great service, which oft
goes unheralded.

My question is this, I keep getting core dumps from FvwmAudio.
I have it set to use /bin/play, a program which came with
the commercial OSS/Linux Sound Drivers that I am using to
get sound.  They are version 2.0.18 BETA.  I have NO problems
using play from the command line, and the fvwm2rc that I use
was someone elses, and it was reported by the author to have
worked fine.  I can cat files to /dev/dsp and /dev/audio.
I have tried both wav and au files.  I have searched this
list via the Web based archive, and didn't find this addressed.
I use RedHat 4.0, and thus, installed fvwm2 and its addons via the
rpm utility.  rpm --query gives me these the following version info:

fvwm2-2.0.43-1
fvwm2-utils-2.0.43-1
fvwm2-icons-2.0.43-1
fvwm2-modules-2.0.43-1

which are all the latest versions I could find.  The redhat list
yielded no reports of such behaviour, so I am wondering if
it could be the commercial sound drivers I use?

I have read the FAQ, done a deja-news search, searched this lists
archive, searched redhat's list, and tried different sound players
and different sound formats.  I DID everything I knew to do, and thus
have subscribed to this list in hopes that I missed something.

Thanks a lot for any input.

Hi,

I am the maintainer of the Fvwm modules for the Dotfile Generator. I
didn't include the PixmapPath in the Fvwm2 module, because i read
somewhere (I don't remember where...) that it was obsolete, and IconPath
would be searched for pixmaps as well.

I have checked my own setup (2.0.43 - no patches), and pixmap _icons_
cannot be found in the IconPath, but pixmap _buttons_ and _menu_ pixmaps 
can!

Of course I could easily generate both IconPath and PixmapPath, but if
PixmapPath is really going to be obsolete, I won't do that.

Does anybody know if PixmapPath will be required in 2.0.44 and later
(Chuck, perhaps;)

BTW: I played around with mini icons, FvwmButtons and the recent genscheme
     package the last couple of days. I just *LOVE* Fvwm-2!

     I did this through the Dotfile Generator of course!

Hi,

I just compiled fvwm2.43 and the wsp1a.diff patch retrieved from http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_title_picture.ht
ml.  Once compiled and installed, fvwm2 no longer would come up.  It 
always core dumps.  Therefore, I had to revert to a plain fvwm2.  How 
do I generate a trace dump from the core file to try to see where 
everything went wrong?  Is there any suggestions on the use of this 
patch?  I am compiling on a SparcStation 2 running SunOS 4.1.3 using 
the GNU gcc compiler.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Fvwm god,

  I have been running fvwm for several years now and I have notice a small
bug while running on HP-UX (9.03) machines.  If you are running xcalc or
some x application and you do NOT kill the process before you log out, the
process runs away and uses all the cpu.  We also use fvwm on IRIX5.3 and
IRIX6.2 workstations and we have never seen this problem.

  I have compiled the latest version of fvwm-2.0.43 and noticed the same
problem.  I even upgraded the OS from 9.03 to 10.2.  I was really hoping
that fvwm2- would solve this problem.  Is there anything i can do????
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

-carl

Hi,

I'd like to make an addition to the wish list:  An enhanced
StaysOnTop/StaysPut style option that had more than two independent
window stacks; at least three, but preferably N.  This could be used to
implement the StaysOnBottom command, for one thing, and probably could
lead to further extensions for grouping windows and applying actions to
particular stacks.  You could have syntax like

Stacks 3
Style "*" Stack 2
Style "FvwmButtons" Stack 3
Style "xosview" Stack 3
Style "xbiff" Stack 3
Style "Reminder" Stack 1
Style "Notification" Stack 1

"Stacks" would default to 2, and the parser would translate
StaysOnTop/StaysPut to "Stack 1"/"Stack 2".  Commands could be added to
raise/lower windows from one stack to another.  Etc.

Is anybody doing this or has plans to do this?  I'll look and see if I
can do it, but I'm no Fvwm internals expert.  Does anyone have any
additional ideas or comments?  Should I wait for the Semi-mythical Great
Style Flag Rewrite?

I just figured out a little bit more about a temporary lockup I've been
having with fvwm...

There are several problems with iconifying windows with a keybinding:

    - suppose you're using sloppy focus...if the pointer is outside of the
      window with focus, you still expect that the window with focus will be
      the one to be iconified when you hit the iconify key.  After all, your
      other keystrokes affect that window, don't they?

    - If no window has focus and the pointer is in the root window, it
      should be possible to tell fvwm to do nothing.  At the very least, it
      should be possible to abort the "iconify cursor" by choosing another
      action with the keyboard...say I want to hit the button that warps to
      netscape... 

BUT THE BIG BUG is this...

    - When using sloppy/mouse focus, iconifying a window  does not always
      throw focus to the underlying window.  Even if the mouse pointer is
      within a new window after the iconify.  That window doesn't go active
      until the pointer is moved into the titlebar of the window.

      To compound this, KEYSTROKES are no longer recognized.  This is to say
      that the pointer is a normal pointer, but fvwm is no longer responding
      to the keyboard...you need to move the pointer into another window or
      the title bar of the currently unfocussed window beneath the pointer.


Is there a hack to fvwm that fixes Netscapes failure to do active focus for
dialog boxes?


    Thanks,
    Stig

I've been getting email on why "version 9b" of the BorderStyle patch
doesn't work, so I've put a note at the top of the following URL
describing the status of what is going on.  I've stopped distributing
the patch for a reason, but others seem to continue to distribute old
buggy development versions as the "latest version."

Part of this is my own fault since I didn't state clearly before why
the patches were taken down.  I hope it is stated better on the page
now.

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

Sorry for the inconviencence!

Fvwm god,

  I have been running fvwm for several years now and I have notice a small
bug while running on HP-UX (9.03) machines.  If you are running xcalc or
some x application and you do NOT kill the process before you log out, the
process runs away and uses all the cpu.  We also use fvwm on IRIX5.3 and
IRIX6.2 workstations and we have never seen this problem.

  I have compiled the latest version of fvwm-2.0.43 and noticed the same
problem.  I even upgraded the OS from 9.03 to 10.2.  I was really hoping
that fvwm2- would solve this problem.  Is there anything i can do????
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

-carl

Greetings all,

I just upgraded to XFree86 3.2 using the RedHat 4.0 RPMS.  All seems
relatively well, BUT, my goodstuff row of buttons now is very small,
showing only the titles, and there seems to have been some shuffling around
of where X looks for its various configuration files, XF86Config now in
/etc, and so on.

I realize that in RedHat the 100dpi fonts got messed up and I had to get
thm from the XFree86 FTP site.  I also notice that my original startup of
Xterm is now back to a small size when I had had it starting in 10x20, but
I think this is due to startup file conflict, methinking that one file is
being used and really another is.

SO, can anyone help on the goodstuff problem, and can anyone point me to a
real simple FAQ on how X starts up, showing what files are read in what order?

For example, when I type in 'startx' at my user prompt, where does it go
from there?  I am trying to trace this down so I can figure out what files
may have gotten goosed.  I'm not at my Linux box right now, so I am running
from memory.

I _did_ notice that in one of the startup files .xclients or .xsession, or
.xinitrc, that xterm is started before my fvwm is.  Is this OK?

If this isall a FAQ, please point me in the right direction.

To FVWM Mailing List:

Subject: Need HELP!

I recently upgraded from fvwm 1.x to fvwm2.0.42 and can no longer get
pixmaps and icons to display.  Your assistance is appreciated to help
diagnose where I've messed up.

Under fvwm 1.x, the GoodStuff button bar and iconified windows would 
display their configured pixmaps.  Under 2.0.42, I get an error msg
at startup in the console (shown below) and no pixmaps displayed 
except those that are "built-in", i.e., mailtool, netscape, contool,
etc..

Details:

Platform = SunSparc 2
OS = Solaris 2.4
Compilier = gcc v 2.6.3
X Rel = X11R6 

xinit = $OPENWIN/bin/openwin -nobanner

$HOME/.xinitrc file

PathToBinary/fvwm2 - last item in .xinitrc

Conversion activities:

I re-named *GoodStuff to *FvwmButtons and converted the exec lines
to correspond with the style described in the man pages.  The button
bar displays with little rectangles that has the title text assigned but
no pixmaps..

Pixmaps are stored in the directory:

	/opt/X11R6/contrib/include/X11/pixmaps/

I have set the value for PixmapPath accordingly in the .fvwm2rc file.
I also linked the above directory to /usr/include/X11/pixmaps and
compiled fvwm2 using the default directory path in Fvwm.tmpl.  Same
result.

The directory structure did not change between 1.x and 2.x.  I did not
"install" the pixmaps included with the 2.x distribution.

I compiled fvwm with HasXpm  YES.

I have re-installed the xpm library in, and set the xpm lib path to:

	/opt/X11R6/lib

include to 

	/opt/X11R6/include

OPTION_DEFINES = -DSHAPE -DPIXMAP_BUTTONS

	This is probably a good place to tell you "I AM A ROOKIE..." I
	can generally get something to compile and THINK I have a vague
	understanding of C Libraries and Include files.. the operative
	word is "THINK"!	

During startup; fvwm puts the following error in the console window.

	[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 
	/opt/X11R6/contrib/lib/fvwm2 PixmapPath

The result in no pixmaps for FvwmButtons or Icons where they have been
defined as an xpm file.

PixmapPath is the first item defined in the .fvwm2rc file, as follows:

Excerpt from fvwm 2.0 config file.
#################################################################
#
#   Where to find the modules, pix and bit maps.

X11R6/contrib/include/X11/bitmaps/:/opt/X11R6/contrib/include/X11/pixmaps/:

END OF EXCERPT

I apologize for the lengthy message, but I wasn't sure what to
include.  Any help would be appreciated...

Thank you in advance.

I don't know if it has something to do with your problems, but  I was having
hard time with FvwmAudio that didn't play the sounds I want.  So I
investigated the code and I found little bugs.

I've made a patch for this that fixes 2 or 3 little things :
 - FvwmAudio doesn't read messages it is not interrested in,
    thus desynchronize,
 - at startup FvwmAudio plays shutdown sound,
 - keep time stamp even if no sound is played,
 - malloc(3) and free(3) much more than needed.

I hear much more sounds now.  I use an external play program, not
rplay, but it should still work with rplay.

    BTW, does anyone know how to have the little window showing 
coordinates/sizes when moving/resising appear in the center of the screen
rather than the upper left corner ? I think I did it once ( or was it
with Fvwm95 ? ) but I just can't remember how.

	Thanks.
	Christophe Martin

Fvwm god,

  I have been running fvwm for several years now and I have notice a small
bug while running on HP-UX (9.03) machines.  If you are running xcalc or
some x application and you do NOT kill the process before you log out, the
process runs away and uses all the cpu.  We also use fvwm on IRIX5.3 and
IRIX6.2 workstations and we have never seen this problem.

  I have compiled the latest version of fvwm-2.0.43 and noticed the same
problem.  I even upgraded the OS from 9.03 to 10.2.  I was really hoping
that fvwm2- would solve this problem.  Is there anything i can do????
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

-carl

Concerning runaway processes:

A couple of years ago, the "tin" that came along with the linux
distribution I was using would run away if its window were killed.  I have
had instances where "less" would do the same thing.  FvwmButtons (or maybe
the FvwmPager; I forget which) for a time was doing this same runaway
thing.  I also use HP-UX machines (with fvwm 1.23), but I can't remember
for certain whether any of these runaways have occurred on HP machines. 
Based on what I have heard and seen, it seems to be a process problem,
rather than a window manager thing, although I suspect it is possible that
some window managers do an ad hoc enforcement of "die, Barney, die".  A
terminal-connected process should note when it is no longer connected, and
simply terminate rather than sucking up all of the CPU it can get in an
attempt to read something from /dev/null or whatever replaces the missing
terminal.

Known problem in the (rather buggy) 2.0.42.  Grab 2.0.43 or wait a few

Is there a .rpm version of fvwm version 2.x? Iv'e been looking around at
the  many ftp sites and web pages but I've only been able to find fvwm95
and version 1.2x. Installing with rpm makes life alot simpler.

Thanks Steve

Hi!

Here are some suggestions about features I feel missing in fvwm. Some
of them might be of inspiration to some of you :-)

- Wildcards in DestroyMenu (eg. DestroyMenu "*" doesn't  work)
- a Style option allowing a window to get its icon from a {bit,pix}map
of same name (eg. "Style "*" AutoIcon" would be somewhat equivalent to
"Style foo Icon <foo.xpm OR foo>", whatever is found first, for every
possible "foo")
- I didn't find a command that would customize icon placement on
screen. I would eg. like them to be placed at the bottom of the
screen, right-to-left...
- References to standard modules' manpages in fvwm2 manpage, section
SeeAlso could be nice, for TkMan with produces hyperlinks from these..

- Perhaps an option in FvwmButtons to allow icon resizing to fit the
computed button-size ?
- A Command in FvwmButtons to reread its conf-file ? (instead of
having to ask fvwm to reread the conffile, killing and restarting the
module)

 That's all for now :-) 
Keep up the good work !

Runing FVWM 2.0.43 on a Sun SPARCstation 1 running SunOS 4.1.3.

I have been trying to get customized icons for different XTerms
depending on the name of the window. I can confirm the name of the
window with the Ident module, but all I ever get is the default Xterm
icon.

Here are the relevent lines from my .fvwm2rc file:
Style "ROGUE"           Icon rogue.xbm
Style "*Weather*"       Icon weather.xbm
Style "trivia.lbl.gov"	Icon office.xbm
Style "xterm"           Icon terminal.xbm

According to the man page:

 windowname can be a window's name, class,  or  resource
          string.  It can contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which
          are matched in the usual Unix  filename  manner.   They
          are searched in the reverse order stated, so that Style
          commands based on the name override  or  augment  those
          based  on  the  class,  which override or augment those
          based on the resource string.

Any suggestions on what I might be able to do to get name selected
Styles to work? Or is this a bug?

I am using fvwm1.0 (and tried 2.0 also) on IRIX5.3 and 6.3. The problem
I have is whenever I resize or move or do something with Netscape, my
windows manager crashes (logs me out).
And this pattern is not reproducable, ie. it happens most of the times
but not always.
Has anybody encountered this? Is there anything I can do to stop this
annoying thing (imagine logging in 10 times a day!).
Thanks in advance for any help.

I noticed that when killing the taskbar and starting a new one (via
the 'Modules' menu), then the Taskbar will not show up and eat all CPU
*if not enough colours were available*. I do not know how high 'enough' is.

I recently built and installed 2.0.43 over a much older fvwm 1.x which
I've been using for quite some time (I've tried afterstep and fvwm95
too).  The problem I keep running into with all the wm's, but especially
with fvwm2, is a color shortage.  I basically just converted my
old .fvwmrc to my .fvwm2rc, adding a couple mini-icons on the titlebar,
but going to fewer colors in xterms and desktop (greys).  After I start
netscape (I don't use -install; the focus-flashing drives me crazy),
I can't even start one xterm which uses colors (e.g. blue on black).
Get the old "Warning: Cannot allocate colormap entry for "#22eeff"".

It seems crazy that this (relatively) expensive Sparc5 with 64mb and
a nice 21" monitor is so display-limited when my (relatively) cheap
PC (with a 2mb Number9 vidcard) running linux is color-abundant.  What
gives?  Is it an inadequate framebuffer (what I call video adapter).

Q: Does fvwm2 "leak" colors, or otherwise somehow waste them?
Q: Is there some (relatively) inexpensive way to upgrade the sparc's
	color capabilities?

Been holding onto these questions for awhile now.  Any reply from 
someone in-the-know will be greatly appreciated.

You're right, that's a bug.

A patch for this was posted after 2.0.43 was released.

Great.  I haven't tried your patches but they appear to be good.
Those macros sure are ugly :)

The main problem with fvwm2 is that you have lots of icons and buttons and 
borders etc which use up your color table allocations.  The best way round 
this is to find a set of colours, and use them over and again. For instance 
make your buttons the same color as your windows etc.. I recently made a set 
of icons that use 16 colors so that I have plenty free for using the various 
display programs I use. However, your biggest enemy is Netscape which eats 256
colors at a time if you don't use -install.

If you had a 24bit framebuffer (a.k.a video adapter) you would not have
this problem. If you had bought one of these with your Sparcstation, you
would not have had to used the word "relatively" when describing how
expensive it was though.....

Netscape without -install will quickly use every color.

Yes, I believe what you have is 24bit color on your  PC and 8bit color
on your  Sun.  There are  Sun systems with 24  bit color but I have no
first hand experience with them.  I keep asking for one, but so far no
success.

> Q: Does fvwm2 "leak" colors, or otherwise somehow waste them?

No there is no leaking that anyone has  reported, but be careful which
icons you  use.  You want to use  icons that are  limited in color and
use the same set of colors.  fvwm itself won't use a lot of colors but
since  you are running netscape   without -install, the  color fvwm is
using is not an issue.

Yes,  running netscape with   -install is relatively cheap.   Learn to
blink just before  you give netscape focus,  this  will help  with the
flashing.  On a more serious note, you can try this: put netscape on a
separate page and maximize it so that it covers the entire page.  When
you switch onto the page, the flash is  still there, but it happens at
the   same time  the entire  screen   is redrawn and   I  find it less
disconcerting.

Otherwise, you need 24 bit color.  I am not sure what the cost is.

You are probably running "Netscape" (or some other application that
likes to hog the color map).  Run the application such that it doesn't
allocate too many colors, or have the offending app install it's own
color map.  If the culprit is Netscape, try one of the following:

	$ netscape -install		# install its own map
	$ netscape -ncols 120		# don't use more than 120 colors

If you use the "-install" option, be prepared for colormap "flashing"
when you select a netscape window.

How about a way to keep Fvwm from changing colormaps untill a user 
has left an application for some time.  When two windows of an 
application are open and the cursor goes from one to the other, the 
screen flashes on the windows boarders even if you do not leave the 
applications (ie. their windows overlap).  This is when the flashing 
is very bothersome.

Try running netscape with the -ncols option (e.g. -ncols 100
or -ncols 64) to limit the number of colors it allocates from
the shared map.  Some browser images may appear dithered, but
I prefer this over to the color map flashing.

In short, yes, the framebuffer is your limitation.  With a
cgsix, you have only 8 bits to work with for your visual
and thus only 256 colors.

>Q: Does fvwm2 "leak" colors, or otherwise somehow waste them?

Still run 1.x, so I'm not sure if 2.x has any cms allocation
bugs.

For the Sparc5, in terms of PC pricing, I don't believe so.
>From Sun, the 24-bit S24 board runs around $2200 list, and the
accelerated 24-bit ZX board around $8995 list.  With 40% off of
that price, neither hit the few hundred dollar range.  I do
believe some third party vendors offer some 24-bit alternatives,
but not certain of names or pricing.

All this talk about netscape and flashing colormaps got me thinking.  Would it
be possible to have a different default colormap for each desktop?  That way
you could have a netscape desktop, an XV desktop, and so on.  Each color
hungry app could eat the whole colormap, without effecting other applications. 
Since the colormap switch would occur while switching desktops, it should be
less noticable.  You also wouldn't have to worry about flashes from moving the
mouse.  I suppose it wouldn't be possible to move a window to a different
desktop, unless you created a new private colormap for it or something.

Anyone think this is possible?  Is there some technical difficulty I
overlooked?

I am using fvwm 2.0.43 (BETA-0). I think there is something wrong with
`RaiseLower' when used in combination with click-to-focus, or perhaps
it's something I've missed.

Let's say my desktop looks like this:

 +(xconsole)-+        (pardon my ASCII art)
 |           |        (window titles are fictional)
 | +[EMACS]---+
 : |          |
   :          :

Emacs is the active window. Now, if I move to the title bar of
xconsole, and click just once, the following happens (all very fast):
 1) xconsole becomes the active window.
 2) xconsole is raised (thus overlapping emacs)
 3) xconsole is immediately lowered.

IMHO, what should happen is that xconsole becomes active and
raised. Why is it lowered afterwards?

Could someone confirm that this is a bug, or at least an irritating
feature? Any workarounds?

Here are the relevant files from my fvwm2rc:

I've thought about it a lot... since I love my 1280x1024 and really hate
switching to 1152x900 for the gimp to not flash me...

The only problem, which could be major, would be that you couldn't
move applications between desktops.  (They wouldn't have the color map
they thought they had...)

It would have to be a new option (or a change to 'sticky') to allow programs
requested colormaps to request one on all the desktops, letting fvwm
handle which colormap is in effect for each.. but even then you'd no
doubt get into a state where you want to move something that didn't
START as sticky to a different desktop and couldn't.

It would be cool, but I don't think it's really doable without making
people hate a lot of other things.

Hello,

I have a general problem : I run Linux 2.0 on a PC with XFree863.2 and fvwm95-2.
I need to open, from fvwm95-2, a session on another machine (running mwm) with 
display on my PC. This other machine complains because there is already a window 
manager on my machine, but then it send its windows ok. Everything works fine 
until I ask this session to end. My Linux session goes down as well.

How to configure fvwm95-2 to tell him not to end when another window manager 
ends ?

Thanks a lot.

Why do you want to start the whole session?  Just start all the
programs you want (sans mwm) and you'll be fine.

I use
	xon foo xterm &
to start an xterm on the foo machine.  The same can be used with any
other program other than xterm.

Hi,

I am using FVWM 2.0.43 on an ULTRA Spac running SUNOS 5.5, can anyone tell me how
to make the Front key on my sun keyboard work within FVWM, that is, either raise 
or lower windows? I was previously using FVWM 1.24r and it worked fine. I am sure
it is just a setting in my .fvwm2rc file that I have missed.

Many Thanks 

	Andrew.

Within your .fvwm2rc file there is a key definition section (the lines 
starting with Key...).
The correct key names for the addtional SUN functions keys on the left are:

F11 - Stop
F12 - Again
F13 - Props
...
F20 - Cut

(if theses don't work for you, try to figure out the correct X events by using 
a program like 'xev').
So, in your case, you just have to add a line

Key F15		A	N	RaiseLower

to your .fvwm2rc

Netscape seems to crash on EVERY platform.  I'm running Linux and it NS
crashes frequently.  If they keep this up, pretty soon they'll be able
to put out a crappy operating system and compete with Microsloth.

did you look at my FvwmAudio <http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~albrecht> ?

Chuck promised to put it into 2.0.44,
but he must have got it wrong.
the patch was last posted on Aug 7th 96 on the list, so I'm sorry if
anybody invested time to find the same bugs, but it sure isn't my fault.

I'd suggest to merge martin's patch (about sync'ing, mark boyns said it's
alright) and mine (the main() function) and put it in 2.0.44, before it's
put out.

regards,
albrecht

Hello,

Following my previous question (see below), may be I can rephrase it :

How can I limit the ability for another machine to kill the Window Manager which 
were started by my machine ?

Thanks a lot.

I'm working on merging the different versions with ediff.  I'll post
it here when I'm done.

I'd suggest to merge martin's patch (about sync'ing, mark boyns said it's
alright) and mine (the main() function) and put it in 2.0.44, before it's
put out.

did that.
see below.
some formatting might be needed to please the different tastes
(I use my emacs to automatically format the code, I write)

regards,
albrecht

/* ChangeLog


 * merged bug fix from Christophe MARTIN <cmartin@ipnl.in2p3.fr>
     - FvwmAudio doesn't read messages it is not interrested in,
       thus desynchronize,
     - keep time stamp even if no sound is played
     - minimize malloc/free

   mark boyns ok-ed this patch, I reviewed it and put out those ugly 
   #defines for RESYNC and READ_BODY by reordering the control structures

 * made FvwmAudio insensitive to its name -> can be symlinked.
   corrected some error message deficiencies, code for quoted 'sound' 
   parameters shamelessly stolen from FvwmButtons/parse.c (with minimal
   adjustments)
   FvwmAudio now supports rsynth's say command:
   *FvwmAudioPlayCmd say
   *FvwmAudio add_window	   "add window"      
   *FvwmAudio raise_window	   'raise window'
               -- 08/07/96 Albrecht Kadlec (albrecht@auto.tuwien.ac.at)

 * Fixed FvwmAudio to reflect the changes made to the module protocol.

 * Szijarto Szabolcs <saby@sch.bme.hu> provided FvwmSound code that used
 $HOSTDISPLAY for the rplay host.  The code has been added to FvwmAudio.

 * Fixed bugs reported by beta testers, thanks!

 * Builtin rplay support has been added to FvwmAudio.  This support is
 enabled when FvwmAudio is compiled with HAVE_RPLAY defined and when
 FvwmAudioPlayCmd is set to builtin-rplay.  I guess it's safe to say
 that FvwmSound is now obsolete. -- Mark Boyns 5/7/94
 
 * FvwmAudio is based heavily on an Fvwm module "FvwmSound" by Mark Boyns
 and the real credit for this really goes to him for the concept.
 I just stripped out the "rplay" library dependencies to allow generic
 audio play command support.

Hello everybody,

I am a novice module writer of fvwm and, unfortunately, my university 
runs fvwm 1.2 only.  I got the (hopefully) all the material needed to get 
started, but they are all for fvwm 2.XX (including the important 
module.tex file).

Does anybody out there know where I can find material specially for
writing modules for fvwm 1.2, and alternatively, the difference between
1.2 and 2.XXX packets?  Now, my program is working in sending instructions
to fvwm but failes to retrieve meaningful packets from it. :(

I have particular difficulty in getting the response of Send_WindowList.

Thank you.

Andrew

When running "wish" (from the new tk8.0a1 release) under fvwm-2.0.43,
if I have the mouse in the wish window and switch to a page of my
desktop with a keystroke, the keyboard focus remains in the wish window
even though the window is no longer visible (it wasn't sticky).

This does not happen with older versions of wish.  It looks like fvwm
is sending a FocusOut event but not a LeaveNotify in the case described
above.

So, my question is: is this an fvwm bug or a Tk/wish bug?  I would assume
it's wish since this is the only application which causes problems, but I
don't know enough about X standards to know if it's kosher for fvwm to
fail to send the LeaveNotify event.  Thanks for any comments -

I don't have the colormap problem anymore, since I upgraded to 24
bit color. However, I _do_ have 4 desks, with one each for xterms,
netscape & xdir, xemacs, and xv & gimp. I'd strongly support a
per-desk colormap option. 

I don't understand the module interface too well, but I wonder if
colormap management could either be built into FvwmPager or done as a
separate module.

 Hi again,

I have still open questions I don't manage to answer on my own. I am
using fvwm2.0.43 on solaris and linux. Here come the new problems:

 3) When I select an entry in the WindowList (activated by 'mouse 3'),
    I get to the Page of the selected window, but the mouse doesn't
    change its position. I 'd like the mouse to go to the top left
    corner of the selected window.

 4) I am working on both color and black-and-white stations. Is there
    a way to define undefined colors or let the fvwm2rc find out
    whether a color is defined and skip it if not? FvwmButtons even
    refuses to start if FvwmButtonsBack is wrongly set.

thanx / yours,
 matthias

Why do you want to start the whole session?  Just start all the
programs you want (sans mwm) and you'll be fine.

I use
	xon foo xterm &
to start an xterm on the foo machine.  The same can be used with any
other program other than xterm.

Hello all.

In my .fvwmrc, I run FvwmCpp on several files.  A file for styles, one for 
functions, one for menus, one for modules, one for keymaps, yadda yadda yadda.
However, if I add to the InitFunction in one of these files, the new
InitFunction never gets ran unless I open an FvwmTalk and execute myself or
bind it to a key or button.  Even if I try and simply call the function as the
last thing in my .fvwmrc, it still does not get executed.  What am I doing
wrong here?

Here is a copy of my .fvwmrc where I read in the separate files, if this helps.
--------
# Standard definitions
Read .fvwm/StdPelDef

# Styles
Read .fvwm/PelStyles

# Functions
FvwmCpp -Cppopt -I/home/ecelrc/staff/pel .fvwm/PelFunctions

# Menus
FvwmCpp -Cppopt -I/home/ecelrc/staff/pel .fvwm/PelMenus

# Keyboard and Mouse definitions
Read .fvwm/KeyMouseMap

# Modules
FvwmCpp -Cppopt -I/home/ecelrc/staff/pel .fvwm/PelModules
---------

I add to my InitFunction with the read from FvwmCpp of PelFunctions. 

If anybody could give me some pointers as to how to get that thing going, I
would be most grateful.

Hi,

I'm new to the mailing list.  I've looked through the list archive and
didn't find any answer (they do discuss key remapping, but it doesn't
help me).  I've been through the FAQ, but admittedly I haven't looked
around who the local guru might be.

I don't know which version of fvwm we were using before, but now we're
using 1.24r.

The configuration is as follows:

~$ uname -a
OSF1 xxx.cl.cam.ac.uk V3.2 41 alpha

Now, I've used xmodmap to remap both of my "compose character" keys to
yield "Control_L".  This used to work in whatever we had before, but
doesn't appear to be working now.

My emacs, as well as an emacs over an rlogin_in_xterm, controlled by
fvwm, displaying on the same X-Server, *DOES* recognize both of the
remapped keys as control keys.  So do normal xterms, xedit, etc..

Here are the (what I think are) relevant sections from my .xmodmap
file:


! -----------------------------------------------------------------
! ----- Remove settings that could get in the way
! -----------------------------------------------------------------

clear shift
clear lock
clear control
clear mod1

! -----------------------------------------------------------------
! ----- What I want to use as the CONTROL key
! -----------------------------------------------------------------

! real Control key
keycode 175 = Control_L

! left Compose key
keycode 177 = Control_L

! right Compose key
keycode 173 = Control_L

! -----------------------------------------------------------------
! ----- now perform the logical key to logical symbol assignments
! -----------------------------------------------------------------

add shift = Shift_L
add control = Control_L
add mod1 = Alt_L


Please, how can I make fvwm recognize the control keys to switch
virtual screens?  Again, here is an excerpt from my config file:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ----- Key bindings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#       Key     Context Modifi  Function
Key     R13     A       C       Scroll  -100    0
Key     R15     A       C       Scroll  +100    +0
Key     R11     A       C       Scroll  +0      -100
Key     Left    A       C       Scroll  -100    0
Key     Right   A       C       Scroll  +100    +0
Key     Up      A       C       Scroll  +0      -100
Key     Down    A       C       Scroll  +0      +100

(private replies or replies to the list are both greatly appreciated)

Thanks a lot,

Oliver Seidel

I'm having a problem with `gnuattach' that seems to occur only under fvwm.
Here's how to produce it.

This is under Solaris 5.5.

1. Start `xemacs -q' from fvwm using a pop-menu or something like that. The
important thing here is to not start xemacs from, say, a shell prompt in
xterm.

I added this line to my .fvwm2rc

	Key KP_F4	R	N	Exec xemacs -q

and start xemacs by pressing KP_F4.

2. M-x gnuserv-start

3. Open a xterm window, and invoke `gnuattach'.

So good so far.

4. Hit ^G in the tty screen. Whammo, you're back at the shell prompt. Not
good.

This problem does not occur when xemacs is started from a xterm shell
prompt, and this problem did not seem to occur under twm.

Specifiying other shells ExecUseShell doesn't help either.

Any ideas?

Various problems with using the FvwmM4 & FvwmCpp modules have always
existed, with the two most prevalent being:
        - rc defaults not taking effect on windows that were in
          existence before fvwm started
        - startup functions not being executed.

I have yet to really be able to really reproduce the first.  But I
just tried a quick test with the second (your problem) and after
adding some more debugging statements to the code I was able to
reproduce it and see what the problem actually is a little better as
well.

The two behaviors are most likely related to the same underlying
problem.  What's happening is this: fvwm is set up to run the startup
stuff (capturing all the windows, building the menus, and running the
startup func), after the first initial read command is finished.
That way theoretically all stuff should get processed before the init
func is called.

But unfortunately since FvwmCpp/M4 is a module which is sending back a
Read command and module input doesn't get processed until fvwm hits
the main event loop, fvwm doesn't see the cmd to do the reading of the
output of FvwmCpp until after it is done with the initial read of your
..fvwm2rc file, so the startup stuff has already been run.

I'm trying to think of a good/correct solution to this right now, but
haven't got it yet, and don't have a lot of time to devote to it right
now.

One idea I had previously was to change FvwmM4/Cpp to be standalone
scripts or executables that could be run & read via the new PipeRead
command, which should eliminate both these problems entirely and have
the added benefit of being able to run them standalone so you can
visually check the output easier.  But, I think I ran into some small
problems with this idea (don't recall right now).

Well, I have to get back to some pressing problems here at work.  I'll
look into this problem more later if I get a chance, but I doubt I'll
be able to get anything for it into 2.0.44 (which I'd like to get out
later today or tommorrow).  Perhaps for 2.1.0 would be a more
realistic goal.

Hi,
	The bug I am reporting has to do with fvwm-2.0.43. I have a Linux system and compiled the package and named it fvwm instead of renaming it to fvwm2. Now the module FvwmButtons does not work. The configuartion is present in the system.fvwmrc file but the tool bar does not come up at all and there are no errors, no messages are displayed but the module does not show up. Is this because I configurated it to install as fvwm instead of fvwm2? I am not sure if this is a bug but I have read through the manual page and everything looks like it should work. I have changed the config file mutiple times without any results. The weird thing is I comiled fvwm-2.0.42 on Solaris and the module works fine. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
						David Zhao
P.S. My Linux system is an i586 running linux 2.0.0 with Xfree 3.2 X-Server. I system was made from a Slackware 96 CDROM.

Ok, at long last 2.0.44 is ready and available from the official ftp
site:

      ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.0.44.tar.gz

and looks like:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      657705 Jan 15 15:24 fvwm-2.0.44.tar.gz

I think I got all the patches that the workers list sent me from their
preliminary testing of it (I hope I got them all) so it should compile
and run under all the platforms nicely.

There are a lot of changes in this beta release, as you'll see from
the ChangeLog entry below:

======================================================================
2.0.44
       1. More man page and FAQ updates
       2. More minor Imake fixes
       3. Patch for IconGeometry placement problems and probs running
          on multiple displays from Graham Barr
       4. Changed Next/Prev 'CurrentScreen' to be 'CurrentPage' and
          added 'CurrentPageAnyDesk', based on patch by Dan Niles
       5. Updated FvwmIconMan from Brady Montz
       6. Fix so FvwmGoodStuff in extras would compile ok
       7. Added Perl routines (fvwmperl in extras dir) for aid in
          making modules written in Perl, from Dan Astoorian
       8. Hopefully fixed long standing startup timing bug in which
          some windows didn't get Style attributes or borders (by
          fixing when server was grabbed and making sure it didn't get
          ungrabbed to early accidentally)
       9. Added FlipFocus function from Dan Niles, to toggle between
          two windows easily
       10. Patch for EdgeResistance timer problem from Mike Blatchley
       11. Patch to FvwmAudio so it works again (new module message
           type M_STRING wasn't recognized) plus other minor fixes and
           enhancements (like being able to use the rplay 'say'
           command and have arbitrary strings instead of sound file
           names), from Albrecht Kadlec
       12. Fixes to FvwmConsole from Toshi Isogai, plus added his
           FvwmCommand to the extras directory (for sending fvwm
           commands from a shell script).
       13. Patch for dynamic icon title recalculation from Ric Lister.
       14. Updates to fvwmrc_convert from Bill Oswald, with some more
           minor mods from me to make it easier to customize for your
           site.
       15. Added 'Echo' function.
       16. Patch to FvwmForm to handle TrueColor from Chris Laas
       17. Changed fcntl in module.c to use O_NONBLOCK (POSIX) instead
           of O_NDELAY (early SYSV) due to differences in behavior on
           some systems (Pyramid SYSV for instance, pointed out by
           Mark Wedel)
       18. Added Python routines (fvwmpython in extras dir) for aid in
           making moduules written in Python, from Barry Warsaw
       19. FvwmBacker now sets root window when it's invoked as well
           as on desk changes
       20. CatchFatal no longer makes XLib calls (to prevent some
           infinite looping under Digital Unix & Solaris), patch from
           Grant McDorman.
       21. Added Andrew Veliath's TitleBar pixmap patch (optional at
           compile time)
       22. Added patch for timing bug in pager when dragging windows
           across desktops under Solaris from Grant McDorman
       23. Added RefreshWindow function, at the request of Mike Kazda.
       24. Changed default XORValue to 1
       25. Changed SmartPlacement behavior to be "stubborn" (like 1.xx
           StubbornPlacement option) and not place over icons (if you
           don't want this you can compile with NO_STUBBORN_PLACEMENT).
       26. Added extras/FvwmScript (which replaces extras/FvwmForm2)
           from Frederic Cordier (although I think it should be
           renamed to something like FvwmFormScript).  It can now
           swallow programs like FvwmButtons.
       27. Sample .fvwm2rc updates, default system.fvwm2rc file now
           minimal to encourange site customization, added more sample
           files to go with it.
       28. Added info to FvwmIdent
       29. Added MiniIcon patch from Brady Montz (optional at compile
           time)
       30. Added BorderStyle border textures (+ TitleStyle, UseDecor,
           etc) patch from Andrew Veliath, part of which was inspired
           by the idea from 'The Rasterman' Carsten Haitzler (optional
           at compile time)
       31. Consolidated Recapture and CaptureAllWindows
       32. Fixes for unmapping problems (patch from Grant McDorman)
       33. Removed redundancy in module.c in Broadcast* funcs.
       34. Multiple -f & -cmd parms now allowed (10 max)
       35. Merged fvwmlib code into some common files, and moved some
           functions out of fvwm proper into them.
       36. Added GlobalOpts builtin (for various options that should
           become Style options later) - this is temporary.  I know
           it's ugly, but I didn't feel like adding 6 (or more)
           temporary functions (lazy, I know...)
       37. Added (GlobalOpts) global option
           SmartPlacementIsReallySmart (may become parm to
           SmartPlacement, or whole new CleverPlacement style after
           the Great Style Flag Rewrite) which uses clever placement
           code from Anthony Martin
       38. Started adding new parsing code based on ideas in patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec, for more consistent parsing.  More
           and more code in fvwm will be converted to use these...
       39. Added WindowListFunc and made built in window list use it
           by default (instead of RAISE_IT), to allow for various
           actions to be controlled by the builtin window list (like
           to warp the pointer or not warp the pointer when giving it
           the focus, or perhaps do something like run FvwmIdent on
           it).  It is interpreted, so you can destroy it and write
           your own version of this default WindowList function.
       40. WindowList now takes reasonable optional parameters instead
           of those cryptic numbers (including an optional function to
           use instead of the default WindowListFunc), based on patch
           from Albrecht Kadlec.
       41. Added WindowId function, sort of like Next & Prev, to force
           a function to happen on a specified WindowID.
       42. Updated FvwmAuto from Albrecht Kadlec (now takes parameters
           for functions to be run on focus in & focus out).
       41. Read funcs now output what they are going to execute if
           -debug parameter was passed in.
       42. Should now be sending synthetic ConfigureNotify on stacking
           changes (for potential motif menubar problems).
       43. Added WindowShade function from Andrew Veliath
       44. Added (GlobalOpts) global options to modify ClickToFocus
           selections: ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/PassesClick,
           ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/Raises (may become parms to
           ClickToFocus after the Great Style Flag Rewrite)
       45. UseStyle should now parse quoted Style refs correctly,
           courtesy of Andrew Veliath.
       46. Added Randall Winchester's CLICKTORAISE compile time option patch
       47. Patch from Greg Badros for FvwmButtons font coredump
       48. Patch from Greg Badros so FvwmM4 passes opts not recognized
           directly to M4 (so -m4opt not needed) and -outfile option.
           Added these to FvwmCpp as well.
       49. Fixes for compiling under Linux for DEC Alpha from Ilkka E
           T Tuohela
======================================================================

And this is NOT all of the stuff I wanted to get in there, but the
rest can wait until the next release, so don't complain too loudly if
your favorite fix didn't make it this time.  It was taking way too
long to get 2.0.44 out the door.

I won't give my usual commentary on these changes as there are way too
many and I have little time right now.  But the most visible ones are
probably the optional BorderStyle/TitleStyle/UseDecor stuff from
Andrew Veliath.  BTW - I'd like to get some examples of usage from
people who make interesting looking setups for inclusion in 2.1.0.

I'd like to make this the last beta before 2.1.0 (have we heard this
before?) if I could.  So if anyone has any suggestions on what they
feel absolutely needs or should be done before 2.1.0 (I do have a few
things in mind already), let me know (preferably via the mailing
lists).

Ideally I'd like to get 2.1.0 out in a few weeks, but as always
that'll probably have to be pushed farther out due the frequent
scarcity of my free time in which to work on fvwm...

As always, I'd like to say thanks to all patch/idea contributors, the
folks on the workers list, and of course, all you users too. :)

Chuck

ps - I've finially gotten around to putting html-ized versions of the
man pages on the web server.  I'll try to keep them updated with each
release as well.  Unfortunately the converter I used (man2html)
doesn't do internal hyperlinks, but it looked much better than any of
the other converters I found (although RossettaMan was close, as I
recall).

Chuck - Thanks for all your efforts on fvwm.  Definitely the best wm around!

Did you happen to modify it so that it has one of my favorite 1.xx features?
That is, the stick windows have a different color decoration, even when
the are iconified?  That's how I recognize windows that I'm root in.

I see you have restore the start icon placement.  This was my other fav
feature.....

Has anyone successfully compiled 2.0.44 against the new X11R6.3
library?


I tried, but got the following (repeated) errors:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"/usr/local/x11r6.3/include/X11/Xlib.h", line 71: identifier redeclared: wchar_t

I'm not sure if this is a R6.3 mis-installation, or an fvwm problem.
[ Note that X11R6.1's Xlib.h is identical to X11R6.3's ]

I did get a successful compile out of the X11R6.1 library, but with
these warnings:

Mark,

I suspect these error seems to be related to your setup.  I am not
running 6.3, but I downloaded Xlib.h from 6.3 to take a peek.

A diff -u produced a 200 line diff between the Xlib.h versions, and I
suspect your problem with with conflicting wchar_t declarations.  The 
"replace this with #include or typedef appropriate for your system"
comment might be of use here.


Xlib.h:62 from R6.1:

#ifndef X_WCHAR
#ifdef X_NOT_STDC_ENV
#ifndef SCO324
#ifndef ISC
#define X_WCHAR
#endif
#endif
#endif
#endif

#ifndef X_WCHAR
#include <stddef.h>
#else
#ifdef __EMX__
#include <stdlib.h>
#else
/* replace this with #include or typedef appropriate for your system */
typedef unsigned long wchar_t;
#endif
#endif


Xlib.h:61 from R6.3:

#ifndef X_WCHAR
#ifdef X_NOT_STDC_ENV
#define X_WCHAR
#endif
#endif

#ifndef X_WCHAR
#include <stddef.h>
#else
/* replace this with #include or typedef appropriate for your system */
typedef unsigned long wchar_t;
#endif


Regards,

...but unfortunately, SmartPlacement is not "stubborn" if
SmartPlacementIsReallySmart is set.  (I use the FvwmPager module, in the
top left corner of the screen, sticky and in its iconified state in
order to make it show the current desktop, so the stubborn behaviour
would be particularly useful for me; right now, pretty the first place a
new window usually decides to nest is under my stays-on-top FvwmPager
icon.)  Adding a non-NO_STUBBORN_PLACEMENT behaviour into
CleverPlacement should be an easy change, yes?

Also, another pet bug of mine which doesn't appear to have gone away: I
use FvwmButtons, with this:

*FvwmButtons Restart icon.xpm     Restart fvwm2

...but whenever I use the button, a warning message is produced:

[FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm2
' failed!!!!

...presumably because FvwmButtons is including the newline from the end
of the configuration line in the command it forwards to fvwm2, and fvwm2
evidently is failing to remove the newline as well--note the newline
before the trailing quote in the error message.  (Is this a FvwmButtons
but or a fvwm2 bug?)

Hi everyone (and happily we are A LOT!)

Even I still didn't sleep this week and even still I have waaay long to 
work on some annoying urgent projects, I was REALLY excited to receive 
this evening the announce of 2.0.44 from Chuck.

Well, I'm enchanted and enlightened :-). Quite a BIG job, so well done 
by all of you bussy fwvm-workers. A heartly THANKS for Chuck Hines.

So, I compiled and installed the new version without any hick-ups. I had 
already all the beautiful/useful patches about styles and 
functionalities which are so carefully mentionned by Chuck in the 
announcement. I am pleased to say that the new binary restarted with my 
old .fvwm2rc without any major error.

The only misfunction I was able to detect so far is that the FvwmAuto 
module fails silently to keep along with the imposed timeout.

More precisely, when one starts or restarts fvwm2, the autoraise occurs 
AFTER the indicated timeout only for the first window which gains the 
focus. After that the autoraise takes place instantly at the focus 
change.

I tried to impose Nop for LeaveCommand, but unsuccessfully. So, until 
new (upgrade :-) events I put back the old FvwmAuto.

Now a little thing. It will be too hard to put a compile time selectable 
functionality in FvwmButtons which to provide ... tooltips on buttons 
according to the Action's Titles? I once begun myself to look at the 
code but meanwhile my time begun very (physically :-) transparent ... I 
would like this because I use some 17 20x20 buttons with SouthEast 
gravity in which I have calls for all my most useful applications and 
also a very little (and cute) swallowed pager. Such little buttons can't 
have titles on them. But almost each button has actions on all three 
mouse click events and so it happens that sometimes I have to remember 
what is where.

So, this very long and quite annoying post finishes here. Thanks again 
to all of you that spent time on this excellent WM. I really like it.

"See" you later

				Cristian

Hi,
	Whenever I run FVWM and have it use a mini-icon X crashes and 
gives the message:

waiting for X server to shut down xterm:  fatal IO error 2 (Broken pipe) 
or KillClient on X server ":0.0"
.

This crash is generated when I do (for example):
AddToDecor ian
        + ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap buttons/w95_min.xpm

However if I use buttons/w95_min.xpm as an application's icon it works, 
so the pixmap file is good. Fvwm95 fails in the same way with mini-icons.

Related, perhaps, is the fact that FvwmButtons doesn't work. It runs, 
spawns its children and quits, leaving the child processes all over the 
place.

I am not sure what is up, everything else on my system works fine.

it is linux 2.0.27 with XF86_S3 3.2. 

Ian

This is strange.  I just tried the above and it worked fine.  Fvwm95
fails too?  This is odd.  What version of Xpm are you using?  Are
there any library mismatches or anything unusual when you upgraded to
XFree 3.2?

Later,
Andrew

i was curious about something...

i was using xvis (x-visual developer) and when i try to close one of the
windows (the form window in particular) the entire app shuts down... :(

curious if there was a fvwm2 window setting or something that would
prevent this.. meaning, that the entire app would close if and only if the
root window of that application was closed... 

i've had this similar problem in other apps too, but got REALLY annoying
in this one.. :) ... 

thanx...

I have a simple question. Some users report that you can't change the
focus when you use ClickToFocus and when the NumLock key has been
pressed. Do you know how to make the ClickToFocus ignore the state of
NumLock?

Of course, you can always press NumLock again but most of our users
will simply say that fvwm is buggy...

(we use 2.0.43, we'll try 2.0.44 soon...)

Thanks!

Please, please, please, can we push hard for a 2.1.0 release?  I know
everyone is working hard, but this is getting a little out of
control...

Thanks! :)

It works like any normal search engine, but it will only return web pages to your site
in particular when accessed from your site. Many companies are charging thousands of
dollars for a site search engine but mine is free. It does a word specific indexing of
your entire site. If you are interested check out the http://flagship.kw.net/personal.htm
You simply add the URLs to your page use it once and our code does the rest.  (It really
is that easy :) Hope to hear from you soon - John Woolsey

It's not just click to focus.  All mouse and key bindings look at num-lock
state.  It seems that only bindings with the Any modifer flag work with
numlock on.

I've written a color button style which can be used with fvwm 2.0.44.  It 
is different from Solid in that it also changes the relief and shadow 
colors.

The patch is at my WWW page,
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/
.

Please don't ask my how to apply a patch, that info is available
elsewhere ;-).  Thanks.

Regards,
Andrew

My undying gratitude to the person who can tell me why this section of my .fvwm2rc
doesn't work under 2.0.44. I crashed my computer twice (Solaris 2.5, basic compile),
so am reluctant to play with it too much.

I am using Solaris2.5 (sparc). When I try ./MakeMakefiles there's error
message:

Making Makefile in sample.fvwmrc
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/local/X11R5/lib/X11/config

done

makedepend: warning:  FvwmAudio.c includes /usr/include/stdlib.h more than once!

And after I tried "make" there were lots of problems, something like:

make[1]: Entering directory `/home/grads/noncis/min/temp/fvwm-2.0.44/libs'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.

I attach the outputs for ./MakeMakefiles(make Makefiles too) and make.
Hope some one could help me! Greatly appreciated.

I know someone's got one.

I have an old fvwm-mode.el by Linh Dang <linhd@nortel.ca>, ver 1.0 (04
Mar 1996), but it appears to be Fvwm 1.xx specific.

Anyone have anything for Fvwm2?

Quote, "It worked before", unquote.
Also having some problems with the new UseDecor
commands.
Is anyone else getting inconistent results?
Eg I set a decor for my 'xpostit' notes, then added 'NoButton 1' etc
to the style, only to always get buttons. Argh!

I just compiled 2.0.44, and after some complaints about stdarg.h not being
found, I got things compiled.  However, when fvwm2 starts up, I just get a
grey background.  The popup menus "pop up," but I cannot start ANY apps.
The only item that does work from the pop up is exit.

I also tried logging in and starting fvwm2 up manually.  After I type
'fvwmw &', my xterm goes blank (no text) and the only thing I can do is
choose exit from the pop up menu.  I tried with and without my current
.fvwm2rc.

Moving back to 2.0.43 works fine.  I even recompiled 2.0.43 one the exact
machine that I compiled 2.0.44 on, and 2.0.43 still works.

I will send in a debug output, but was just wondering if anyone else
running SunOS 4.1.4 (Sparc 20) and gcc 2.7.2 had similar problems.

I use a locally hacked version of winmgr-mode.el, appended below.
Note that I am not maintaining it, but it seems to do everything I
want it to.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a major mode for editing window configuration files and
;; also defines font-lock keywords for such files.

;; winmgr-mode mode will automatically get turned on if you visit a
;; a file whose name looks like that of a configuration file
;; (IE, .fvwmrc, .mwmrc, .tvtwmrc, etc)

;; The current font-lock keywords are:

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by whitespace gets colored using
;; font-lock-function-name-face.

;; any word of upper or lower case letters at the start of a line
;; followed by a "(" (IE, an m4 macro) gets colored using
;; font-lock-comment-face

;; Put this in your .emacs :
;;
;;(setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '(("\\.[A-Za-z]*wm$" . winmgr-mode)
;;              ("\\.[A-Za-z]*wmrc" . winmgr-mode) 
;;	      auto-mode-alist))

I don't see how this affects UseDecor (I may be seeing wrong).  I have

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Here's a patch to the fvwm2.man page fixing some spelling and other
errors.

Note in particular the fix in the Mouse definition section; without this
the formatted man page is missing an entire line and the docs are
incorrect.

Also, I think some examples are absolutely critical.  Especially because
the strictly alphabetical ordering of the sections in the man page can
be quite confusing: you come to AddButtonStyle before you find
ButtonStyle, for example.  It can be really hard to figure out what's
going on... I'm still not clear on the difference--is it just that
AddButtonStyle adds to the existing style, while ButtonStyle deletes the
existing style, if any, first?  If so, it seems to me that this syntax
is a bit confusing.  Can't ButtonStyle incorporate both of these?

Also, the new syntax of (), --, and ! for styles should be explained,
perhaps, in its own section.

And some examples of good uses of decors, title styles, etc. is
imperative.  I'm not necessarily saying all these should go in the man
page, of course, but some comments somewhere to help one wade through
the myriad features is mandatory.  I'm lost!

Fair enough. Its probably not the UseDecor per se.
Anyone care to show me the error of my ways in this simple snippet:
(mainly for me to learn how to use all 'this new fangled' stuff)

AddToDecor notes
+ BorderStyle Simple -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+ TitleStyle -- flat
+ HilightColor white black
+ WindowFont -b&h-lucida-bold-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-p-*-iso8859-*

Style "notes"     UseDecor notes, HandleWidth 1, Sticky, Color black/white
Style "notes"     Icon Notes.xpm, NoButton 1, NoButton 3, NoButton 5, NoButton 7

Style "XPostit"   UseStyle notes

This is pretty much per the man page example (under AddDecor).
Now, the problem is that this (and many variations of it) leaves me with a 
custom decor window, but with all the buttons on it. Er..why?
And no icon either come to think of it.

Yes, I see the behaviour with the buttons.  Actually I remember noticing
this last year sometime as well -- it seems to be a problem with fvwm2.  I
think you found this since it was previously a less used feature, but I
guess with the decors it is more useful.

btw, it seems to work if you put the NoButton options on the Style for
XPostIt instead

I just played with this a bit, and discovered after some mulling and then
experimenting, that if you only have _one_ Style "notes" with all of the
options on one line (with \ to continue lines) it works.

Well, the problem is that examples need to be created.  Chuck mentioned
that he's looking for donations of RC examples (hint, hint :-).  It's
difficult for one person to come up with many examples, the best ones are
usually picked out from posts. 

Note that one can even disable all of the new features if you do not want
to wade through all of the them :-).

I just figured out why the UseStyle doesn't work -- it is pretty clear
actually.  UseStyle finds the first occurance in the name list and then
uses only those values.  It ignores further, identical entries in the list
(new entries are created even for identical names), which is precisely why
it only uses the values from the first Style command. 

This means UseStyle is a bit broken, but the workaround as described
before is to place the entire Style definition on a single line, or to use
the \ to continue on next lines.

Fair enough. The problem is that if you're trying to find out how these
things work from the man pages as they stand, you haven't got a hope!
It may even be worthwhile having a separate man page for the various
'decor' items now, there are many keywords involved and in the mainly
alphabetical listing in the (huge) main man page its hard to put them
together. A more organic approach showing a typical set up and then
a tree like structure of options for BorderStyle, ButtonStyle, TitleStyle,
etc.

Under the manual entry for 'ButtonStyle' at the moment there is even
a TitleStyle example! (Its about VGradient but still...)

It'd be much easier to read if all these 'cosmetic' decor commands
were grouped together. After all their syntax is quite similar.
And the syntax isn't as easy as it used to me, its harder to read
until you figure out where you are. Ever see a new fvwm user's
face looking at a UseDecor statement (well, neither had I until
today obviously...but it was 'Uh? Whats this? I thought I was
getting used to this ..rc stuff')

(It doesn't help that there are degenerate manual entries too...
	TitleStyle [justification] [height num]
	TitleStyle [state] [style] [ -- [!]flag ...]	)

Note, no-ones complaining about the functionality, just about
to use _all_ of the features. Lets face it, I want as many different
effects on the screen at once as I can get!

There was a small patch which didn't make it into fvwm 2.0.44.  The fix
for this was posted to fvwm-workers.

Fair enough ;-).  I am trying to put together a decor_hints file to give
an overview of the new features, but it is taking a while.  If anyone
wants to help, feel free.  Some of these things are not easy to do in the
current man page setup.

Maybe what I can do is when I can write up something of a small HowTo for
the new featurisms, then someone might want to rewrite some of the man
page entries. Having fairly intimate knowledge of internal operation of
these new features sometimes makes it difficult to write objectively about
usage, it might be better explained by someone who is familiar with these
features, but from a new perspective (thus the HowTo :-).

I've been told that the FvwmIconMan in fvwm 2.0.44 is version 0.8, which is
exactly 0.1 out of date. If you have a burning need, you can get the latest
from:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/

The only changes are a new option which specifies whether to honor the window
list that fvwm maintains when deciding which windows to manage, and I fixed a
probable coredump-inducing bug.

I'm trying to write a program what has a child window with a colormap
different from the rest of the window.  If you use xmag to grab a window
with a private colormap, you get the same thing.

I did everything I thought I should do, found a bug in the xforms libarary,
and worked around it, but still no go.  Anyway, the problem is fvwm.

The way you go about having children with different colormaps from the
top-level window is to set WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property to the list of child
windows.

What fvwm does when a window with this property gets focus is to install in
reverse order all the colormaps for windows listed in that porperty.

Some systems, notably SGI's, allow for multiple colormaps to be installed at
once.  Many systems do not.  If the number of colormaps the system can
display at the same time is greater than or equal to the number of colormaps
the window and its children use, this works ok.  If the max colormaps is
less, like say its 1 and the window wants 2, this doesn't work.

For systems with fewer colormaps it would be nice if the window manager would
install colormaps when the mouse entered such a window.  xmag does this
with a kludge of modifying the colormap_windows property when the
mouse enters and leaves the window, so that the first window listed is the
one the mouse is in.  fvwm will install this colormap last, so it's the
one that stays.

I think I can fix fvwm to provide this behavior, as well as remove some
bugs and sillyness from colormap.c.  What I need to know is if there is some
way to get fvwm notified when the mouse enters a window that's a child of
a top-level window, but not itsself a top-level window.  If it helps I know
the window ID.

Would it be a good idea if the window is shaded to inhibit
resize and/or maximize?  As it is, when the window is maximized it doesn't
shade since it would require another state variable in the window
structure.  Also, a shaded window, upon a maximize or resize attempt
reverts to unshaded and gets resized, which is why you get a single line
thing.  Maybe it would be better to inhibit resizing by ringing a bell
(this is a trivial change)?

All of the changes to fvwm 2.0.44 I've made are now in the file: 

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/andrew.2.0.44.diff.gz

Changes include:

	- WindowShade fix (Resize/Maximize inhibited for reliability and
	consistency, and that top edge fix I posted previously)

	- UseStyle fix (should fix the inconsistency problem)

Please try it and post your results.

a request:

I would like to have my iconman swallowed in the toolbar ... but as it keeps
changing size this is difficult ... wouldn't it be possible to have it
assume a fixed size and scrollbar for inclusion in the toolbar ?

I am no X programmer, otherwise I would send you a patch ...

Suppose following function:

AddToFunc InitFunction "I" Exec xon CPUSERVER xterm

It works as I imagine on fvwm-2.0.43, but in fvwm-2.0.44, it
fails, freezed. However, popup menus can be used.

Any helps ? Later I'll check the code also...

Since I don't normally use icons, I hadn't noticed CleverPlacement's poor
handling of icons.  I have now modified CleverPlacement to place windows
around icons properly.  It also tries to avoid StaysOnTop windows and you
can make it avoid Sticky windows if you want (compile-time option).

To use CleverPlacement in 2.0.44, put the following line in your .fvwm2rc
file:
GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

The patch also fixes a bug in the placement code that causes windows to be
misplaced by one pixel if the RandomPlacement flag is set.  This fix seems
to have missed 2.0.44.

The patch is attached, but if you prefer, you can get the entire
placement.c file from:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c
Just replace the original placement.c and recompile.

Let me know if you have any problems.

Tony.

Turn SmartPlacement on.  See the man page for details on how to do
that, but I think the following will be a start:

    Style "*" SmartPlacement

Hi,

WIBNI this were a parameter one could set in .fvwmrc?

(Similar for the AVOIDSTICKY and AVOIDICONS parameters Anthony
proposed.)

If you move a window with WindowShade activated, and then deactivade
WindowShade, and then try to use a menu on the menubar in the application,
say any Tcl/Tk program or Netscape etc., the menu will pop up at the
previous position of the window.

Try it out :)

Hello,
	I just compiled 2.0.44 on my solaris 2.5 box.  It seems to have compiled.
but since I am not root, I specified a FvwmBinDir to a directory under my home,
but when I do the install I get this error.

installing in ./libs...
install in ./libs done
installing in ./fvwm...
install -c   fvwm2 /homes/jgaither/public/bin
cp: /homes/jgaither/public/bin: is a directory
install: cp /homes/jgaither/public/bin fvwm2/bin failed
*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `/homes/jgaither/public/bin/fvwm2'
Current working directory /home1/jgaither/fvwm-2.0.44/fvwm
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'

Any help??

Justin

Well, I had been using a hacked fvwm-2.0.43 / fvwm95-2.0.41a (basically
just adding the stuff that gives it the Win95 look and feel).  After
hearing about the BorderStyle and related patches (my sources were too
hacked up to patch correctly, so I waited PATIENTLY for 2.0.44), I've
decided to put together a Win95 appearance for fvwm.

So far... It's PRETTY CLOSE... but still no joy.

MenuStyle	Black grey75 grey40 adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-120-*
AddToDecor	win95
+	TitleStyle LeftJustified ActiveUp (Solid Navy -- flat) \
	ActiveDown (Solid Navy -- flat) Inactive (Solid grey51 -- flat)
+	ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- UseTitleStyle flat
+	ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap win95-close-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
+	ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap win95-maximize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
+	ButtonStyle 6 Pixmap win95-minimize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
+	BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+	BorderStyle Inactive -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+	WindowFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
+	HilightColor white grey60

Style "*"	UseDecor win95, ForeColor Black

The win95-*.xpm files are pix of the Win95 buttons from the fvwm95
distribution, and grey75.xpm is a 1-pixel XPM file that contains a
single grey75 pixel (BorderStyle could possibly use a COLOR command!). 
All these .xpm files are attached to this message via MIME.


Also, the fvwm2 man page could do some explaining about 'ActiveUp' and
'ActiveDown' and how they apply to the TitleStyle and other functions.

Anyway, I'm posting this as an attempt to drive a stake in the ground to
get something that looks like Win95 - NT4.0.  If anybody wishes to tweak
with the values that I got empirically, feel free!  (And let me know!)

Does anybody have any mwm, olwm, twm, etc. decor styles?  I'm hoping we
can get a few of these styles so that we can create fvwm2 functions
like:

AddToFunction	StyleWin95
"I"	Style "*" UseDecor win95, ForeColor Black
"I"	MenuStyle Black grey75 grey40 adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-120-*

AddToFunction	StyleMwm
...

We could then make a pop-up menu, or FvwmButtons display that will allow
the user to select the desired window display style...  this would make
a powerful enhancement to the system.fvwm2rc file.

Anybody game for such a project?

Yup, just tried it and saw it :-).  I failed to heed the synthetic
ConfigureNotify, but I changed it to do so by sending a ConfigureNotify
when it is unshaded, which corrects the problem.  Thanks for noting this. 

The fix is in a new all changes patch:
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/andrew2.2.0.44.diff.gz

The diff from the andrew.2.0.44.diff.gz is here (line is cut in two):

I do believe that someone else had this problem also, yes, although I
don't recall who right now.

I just tried to reproduce this with my local development version of
fvwm (right now it's essentially just 2.0.44 plus a couple of the
patches posted to the mailing lists) on a SunOS 4.1.3 machine that I
have access to (compiled using acc, with "the works" defined in
Fvwm.tmpl, and displaying to xmx version 2pl6 alpha since I can't sit
at the console right now) and it worked fine for me.

So I tried 2.0.44 itself, to see if it was the patches that made a
difference.  It too worked fine.

So, try compiling fvwm w/ -g to put the debug info in there, then run
it under a debugger, if you can, and try to get a traceback of where
it's locking up please.  Perhaps you could turn on the FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS
too (configure.h at bottom).

Looks good.

The nice thing is that you can make it look BETTER than Win95 by putting
stuff like gradients and stuff in.  On my (outdated)  BorderStyle patch
page, I had a Win95 similar window that had a gradient on it (slight, but
there :-).

It's explained in ButtonStyle, but I guess there should be references to
it (this applies to every command where it says state can be one of ...,
a notable exception is BorderStyle which only has two state as explained
in Fvwm.tmpl):
              state refers to which button state should  be  set.
              Button  states  are  defined as follows: "ActiveUp"
              and "ActiveDown" refer to the unpressed and pressed
              states  for  buttons  on  active windows; while the
              "Inactive" state denotes buttons on  inactive  win-
              dows.

Sounds good.  You might consider incorporating ChangeDecor+Recapture too
for dynamic style changing.  On my page with those three different styled
windows at the time I was able to dynamically change the styles and decors
individually on each window with the ChangeDecor+Recapture.

As anyone who has looked at my desktop recently will be aware I love all
this decor stuff.. The more decorated (or poncy as people like to say) my
windows the better. Now that this decor has come along I've got a default
decor, an xterm decor and a sticky decor. I've just added two functions
so that when I change a window to being Sticky, it's decor changes and 
vice versa....

AddToFunc Change-Stick		 "I" Stick
+				 "I" ChangeDecor "sticky"

AddToFunc Un-Change-Stick	 "I" Stick
+				 "I" ChangeDecor "Default"

But this requires two separate options on a menu.. Is there a way of
getting the thing to toggle the Decor on and off instead? A kind of..

if STICKY:
	Stick
	ChangeDecor "Default"
else
	Stick
	ChangeDecor "stickydecor"
endif

?????

When running fvwm v1.24 on AIX workstation main console (/dev/hft0 or
/dev/lft0 depending on workstation model), the fvwm process is launched
twice
so as the user defined xterm sessions. Did anybody reported the problem
to you
 and did you find a solution ?
(I though first that it was a user X session problem but it occurs what
user you
log in and only on the main display. Any network connected display works
properly)

	Thanks for answering and may be helping !

	Arlette

P.S. same problem with fvwm95. All other installed wm works properly

same for 2.0.44 (-almost & release), sunos 4.1.3 and gcc 2.5.7 
(I'm not the sysadmin here :-)

I removed all "Wait" `s from my InitFunction, RestartFunction,
ExitFunction. now it works.

no time to debug this yet.

currently working on FvwmAuto & FvwmAudio bug reports.

I think 'Wait' function does not work properly. In a InitFunction or
RestartFunction, fvwm freezes, and in a usual complex-function, it
does (maybe) nothing.

Chuck:

Albrecht Kadlec suggested (a few minutes ago) to remove any references to
Wait functions in the fvwm2rc file.  After I did this, 2.0.44 worked fine.
I think Matsushita-san may be right--'Wait' does not appear to work
correctly anymore.

To be honest, I can't remember why I originally used Wait in my rc files...

Just a small comment, when using AddToFunc with all "I" commands, make
sure you put the first command on the AddToFunc line, such that AddToFunc
MyFunc "I" MyCommand, otherwise you will get a ClickTime delay.

I found this out the hard way :-).

If I continually switch between the decors using the DecorWin95 and
DecorMwm function, little by little, FvwmButtons and Fvwm Pager will
start to disappear... it looks like they shrink by a pixel or two each
time I recapture.  These two modules are run without titles or handles,
and that may have something to do with the problem.

This appears to be a bug; I haven't examined the recapture code in fvwm
to see what the cause is, but I thought I'd report this so that it will
be fixed before we go into 2.1.0.


By the way, fvwm-2.0.44 was worth waiting for... Way to go, Chuck, and
everybody else on fvwm-workers!

I'm currently rewriting all of the X code for FvwmIconMan, firstly so that
it's as optimal as I can humanly make it with respect to redrawing, secondly
so that I can make it not keep unmapping and mapping itself, and thirdly to add
multiple columns, and the ability to grow horizontally as well as vertically. 

With multiple columns, and horizontal growth, it's very simple to bound the
size of the window, and have it just keep adding columns (which get
progreessively narrower, like the windows95 taskbar) as it adds icons. As with
any rewrite though, it's taking an unbounded amount of time as other things
have higher priority. I'm going to get back to it this weekend though.

As for a scrollbar, I hadn't thought of that. I'm not using any sort of widget
library though, so that could get tricky. I'll have to ponder the options.

Are you sure you're comparing X11R6.1 and X11R6.3 as distributed by
ftp.x.org (not XFree86)?

My diff only says,

$ diff -c /usr/local/x11r6.1/include/X11/Xlib.h /usr/local/x11r6.3/include/X11/Xlib.h

I'm on a Solaris-2.5/Sparc system, if it matters.

AV> suspect your problem with with conflicting wchar_t declarations.  The 
AV> "replace this with #include or typedef appropriate for your system"
AV> comment might be of use here.

AV> Xlib.h:61 from R6.3:

AV> #ifndef X_WCHAR
AV> #ifdef X_NOT_STDC_ENV
AV> #define X_WCHAR
AV> #endif
AV> #endif

AV> #ifndef X_WCHAR
AV> #include <stddef.h>
AV> #else
AV> /* replace this with #include or typedef appropriate for your system */
AV> typedef unsigned long wchar_t;
AV> #endif

This is the Xlib.h fragment I see in both R6.1 and R6.3. The only
thing I can see that could cause the error is that X_NOT_STDC_ENV must
be defined in the R6.3 xmkmf but not in the R6.1 xmkmf. Otherwise,
X_WCHAR is not defined (as under R6.1 apparently) and stddef.h gets
pulled in. Although the error from cc complained about stdlib.h <->
Xlib.h inconsistency, not stddef.h <-> Xlib.h inconsistency, so I'm
still confused, and a grep of the R6.1 xmkmf generated Makefile
doesn't contain `X_NOT_STDC_ENV'. I confess I'm not real proficient in
xmkmf (or cc), so I may be missing something obvious to others.

Note that stddef.h defines,

#ifndef _WCHAR_T
#define	_WCHAR_T
typedef long	wchar_t;
#endif

I suppose a Q & D fix would be to change the line in Xlib.h to agree,
but I'd really like to understand why the R6.3 xmkmf build fails.

BTW, are these compiler warnings

  "add_window.c", line 251: warning: integer overflow detected: op "<<"

and

  prototype: pointer to function(int) returning void : "/usr/include/signal.h", line 37
  argument : pointer to function(void) returning void

anything to be concerned about?

Thanks.

Hi,

I thought I'd tell y'all what I use to get a kinda-like Win'95 look.

Here's what I use:

,-----
| # Global styles				
| TitleStyle LeftJustified ActiveUp (Solid midnightblue -- flat) \
| 	  ActiveDown (Solid midnightblue -- flat) \
| 	  Inactive (Solid lightgrey -- flat)
| BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles, NoInset	
| ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- UseTitleStyle flat
| ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap win95-maximize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
| ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap win95-minimize-full.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
| 					  
| # Colors				
| HilightColor lightgrey grey45		
| #HilightColor black cornflowerblue	
| MenuStyle black lightgrey slategrey -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-70-iso8859-1
| 					  
| WindowFont      -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--11-80-100-100-p-60-iso8859-1
| IconFont        -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--11-80-100-100-p-60-iso8859-1
| 					  
| #					
| # Style section				
| #					
| Style "*"		Color black/grey
| Style "*"		BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5
`-----

I also use the helvetica-11 and helevtica-12 fonts in a couple of
other places.  I'm not quite happy with the Pager and the IconMan
setup, though, and I'd appreciate any comments on the look that you
might have.  Here are the relevant lines:

,-----
| ########################### Pager #########################################
| *FvwmPagerBack lightgray   
| *FvwmPagerFore black	   
| *FvwmPagerFont -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
| #*FvwmPagerHilight slategray1
| *FvwmPagerHilight grey40   
| *FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8	   
| 			     
| ##########################FvwmIconMan##################################
| *FvwmIconMan*resolution desk
| *FvwmIconMan*font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-70-iso8859-1
| *FvwmIconMan*format %t	   
| *FvwmIconMan*foreground black
| *FvwmIconMan*background lightgrey
| *FvwmIconMan*plainbutton up
| *FvwmIconMan*selectbutton flat white grey40
| *FvwmIconMan*focusbutton down white grey40
| *FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton flat black cornflowerblue
| *FvwmIconMan*followfocus true
| *FvwmIconMan*sort true	   
| *FvwmIconMan*drawicons true
`-----

In particular, I'd like the Pager to show in midnightblue the window
that currently has focus.

The dark grey colors don't look well (in the Pager and in the IconMan).

Why doesn't the focusandselectbutton line ever take effect?

Looking forward to your comments,
kai

I thought I'd post some RC examples which use various features.  Nothing
complicated, but stuff I've found useful at this point.

Andrew

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what I use for WindowShade (double-click the title-bar):

Mouse 1 T       A       Move-Raise-Shade

AddToFunc Move-Raise-Shade      "I" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "D" WindowShade


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some CUA similar bindings I use:

Key F4          W       M       Close
Key F4          W       SM      Destroy
Key space       W       M       Popup SomeWindowOpsMenu

Then in SomeWindowOpsMenu of course a tab (must be tab) should be
placed after the &Close option and then Alt-F4 (or Meta) or something.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what I use for FvwmCascade/FvwmTile:

AddToMenu TileMenu
+       "&Horizontally"         FvwmTile -h -mn 3 2 2 90 85
+       "&Vertically"           FvwmTile -mn 3 2 2 90 85

AddToMenu [I actually put this on root menu :-]
+       "&Cascade"              FvwmCascade -resize 2 2 80 60
+       "&Tile"                 Popup TileMenu


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For window navigation I use these (these work in both MouseFocus and
ClickToFocus!).  Note ToggleWindow which uses the FlipFocus function
from Dan Niles and once you get the hang of it, it's really nice:

Key Tab         A       C       ToggleWindow
Key Right       A       SCM     NextWindow
Key Left        A       SCM     PrevWindow

AddToFunc FocusWindow           "I" Focus
+                               "I" WarpToWindow 10 10

AddToFunc NextWindow            "I" Next [!iconic] FocusWindow

AddToFunc PrevWindow            "I" Prev [!iconic] FocusWindow

AddToFunc ToggleWindow          "I" FlipFocus
+                               "I" Prev [!iconic] FocusWindow

This is a bug which was much more prominant in fvwm 2.0.43 since changing
your WindowFont would continually shrink your untitled windows.  I thought
I fixed it, but I may have missed it.  I'm looking into it now.

You might want to try my Color buttons patch, which you could say (Color
midnightblue) so you will have matching relief and shadow colors. 

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/ \
fvwm-2.0.44.av.colorbtns.diff.gz

Also, I have all of the Windows NT 4.0 color schemes on a menu for 2.0.44
(but the look is not Win95)  You can grab my genscheme 1.1 package off of
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming to generate these.

Later,
Andrew

For instance, in my genscheme package, I use this template for my
per-scheme (foreach) definition: 

changecom()dnl
AddToDecor Default

+ TitleStyle Inactive Color InactiveTitle
+ HilightColor TitleText ButtonFace
AddToDecor `"Small Window"'

Then the Brick scheme (all schemes are generated) would come out as (with

To clarify, I fixed the major part of the problem.  There may be something
small I missed somewhere.

The problem was that in font changing, fvwm used to recalculate the size
of the frame, but for untitled windows as well, which it shouldn't.

Uh, never mind. I'm a bonehead.

I naively thought I could get the R6.3 xmkmf by typing,
`/path/to/x11r6.3/bin/xmkmf'. But xmkmf is just a wrapper script that
calls imake, so if R6.1's imake is ahead of R6.3's imake in your PATH,
then all confusion breaks loose.

The solution, of course, was to simply place /path/to/x11r6.3/bin/ in
front of /path/to/x11r6.1/bin/ on my PATH. fvwm-2.0.44 then compiles
successfully on this platform (X11R6.3/Solaris-2.5/sparc).

Sorry for the false alarm.

I've made andrew4.2.0.44.diff.gz available under

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/ .

The file andrew3-andrew4.2.0.44.diff.gz in there is the change from
andrew3 (mainly for Chuck, very small).

I think this will fix Larry's problem with DestroyDecor and shrinking
windows, but have not tested it (however, it should be changed anyway).

Can someone give me an example of how flipfocus is used?  I tried
binding it to a key, but it seems to be a no-op that way.

Thanks,

I just posted an example of it a few messages back in a function named
ToggleWindow.

Hello.  I wrote FlipFocus, and this is my primary use of it:

Key F8          A       N       Prev [CurrentPage] FlipFocus

When I hit F8, I go to the previous window.  When I hit it again, I go
back to the first window.  This is the easiest way to switch back and
forth between 2 windows.

Thanks to Dan Niles and Andrew Veliath for such quick response.  The
answer is that FlipFocus should be used in conjunction with Prev (or
presumably Next).

I've just installed 2.0.44 (from 2.0.42) and I'd like to see what all
the new features do, but I'm too lazy to figure them all out from the
man page. I'd especially like examples using mini icons, BorderStyle,
TitleStyle, ButtonStyle, etc. I could try the examples in the man
page, but I don't have the pixmaps (marble, granite, up, down,
inactive, etc.).

It'd be nice if fvwm came with a style sampler that would let one
browse various combinations. I'm thinking of something like a .fvwm2rc
file with menus that would pop up windows with different styles
showing the .fvwm2rc code used to achieve them. E.g., a menu for
various BorderStyles, another for TitleStyles, another for
ButtonStyles, etc. I realize that'd be a significant chunk of work,
though.

I'd be happy if a few people would just bundle up their favorite
configs--including .fvwmrc and pixmaps--and posted them to the
list. Perhaps they could be bundled with 2.1.x.

Jeppe Buk is working on the fvwm2 module for the dotfile generator.  From
what he has told me, it will I think do some or all of what you mention.

When 2.1.0 comes out I'm going to post my configuration up, as I hope some
others will.  Better yet, send your configuration to the fvwm2rc
repository (my god, I have one in there from a few years ago and it scares
me -- good time to update it :-).

the reason I am asking is, that I have found the following setup to be very
conveniant ...

[...]
*FvwmButtons(2x13, Frame 0, Padding 0 0,\
	Swallow(NoHints) FvwmIconBox FvwmIconBox)

[...]
# FvwmIconBox
*FvwmIconBoxPlacement left top
*FvwmIconBoxHilightFocusWin
*FvwmIconBoxBack        gray74
*FvwmIconBoxIconBack    LightSteelBlue3
*FvwmIconBoxIconFore    Black
*FvwmIconBoxIconHiBack  PaleVioletRed3
*FvwmIconBoxIconHiFore  Black
*FvwmIconBoxHideSC horizontal
*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 69x0
*FvwmIconBoxSetWMIconSize       48x48
*FvwmIconBoxLines	1
*FvwmIconBoxPadding     1
*FvwmIconBoxSBWidth     8
*FvwmIconBox "Fvwm*" -
*FvwmIconBoxFont	10x9
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       1 Click RaiseLower
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       1 DoubleClick Iconify
*FvwmIconBoxFrameWidth	0 0
*FvwmIconBoxSortIcons	ResName

unfortuantely the IconBox does not like it, when its icon size is set to 0.
it complains loudly on every new window ... I have sent a bug report to the
list about this, but nobody seems to care ...

and looking at the diffs ftom 43 to 44 the code for the IconBox seems not to
ahve been changed much ... 

well that's why I thought your tool might prove to be more suited to the
task ...


cheers

Where can one obtain decor examples, including what commands can be
placed in them, info on their initial state (do they include decor
default by default?) and other such info?  The man pages do not do
much to explain.

People have posted a few examples, and in general, we are looking for
examples.  I suspect it will take a few days for people to obtain a handle
on the features and start creating things.

btw, AddToDecor states that created decors start out just like fvwm2
without any commands.

Can people ask me questions without expecting a response (until the FAQ
comes out ;-)? I am putting together an HTML FAQ (which will take a while,
but I'll put it up in the intial stages), but need to know what the
questions are.

now that the wait function hangs, I had to remove
#+			"I"	FvwmBanner
#+			"I"	Wait FvwmBanner
from my RestartFunction.

I still experience the old FvwmButtons / fvwm2 bug:

	a second instance of all swallowed (UseOld, NoClose, Respawn) 
	applications is started, since FvwmButtons had no time to
	regurgitate the old instances completely.
	Therefore no window does exist for them, and they're simply not
	found by UseOld.

I thought somebody sent chuck a patch for that for 2.0.43, but I can't find
it.

fine, but ident windows don't go away anymore, if focus ever leaves them.

try:
Ident on any window, click in ident window.

ident on any window, move mouse to root window (sloppyfocus), clicking on
the ident window doesn't remove it anymore. stays put. :-(

Yeah, I think it would be pretty conveniant too, but have never gotten around

  Dear everyone, nice to meet you all.

  I have one bug-report for WindowShade on fvwm-2.0.44 recently
distributed.  

[PROBLEM]
A problem occurs when shading a window whose border 
width less than 1.  Error messages as follow are shown 
in console where fvwm2 is running.

----- error -----
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 12, Error 2, EventType: 4
-----------------

Although the error messages are shown, everything does 
not look so bad.  

In addition, this problem does not occur on un-shading.

[TO BE FIXED]
After looking the source files on, I found inconsistency in
borders.c.
The file ./fvwm-2.0.44/fvwm/borders.c should be fixed at 
around 1500 line as:
-----
[original]
  cy = tmp_win->title_height + tmp_win->boundary_width-tmp_win->bw;
 
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
  if (!shaded)
#endif
      XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->w, tmp_win->attr.width,
                    tmp_win->attr.height);
  XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent, cx,cy,
                    tmp_win->attr.width, tmp_win->attr.height);
[fixed]
  cy = tmp_win->title_height + tmp_win->boundary_width-tmp_win->bw;
 
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
  if (!shaded) {
#endif
      XResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->w, tmp_win->attr.width,
                    tmp_win->attr.height);
  XMoveResizeWindow(dpy, tmp_win->Parent, cx,cy,
                    tmp_win->attr.width, tmp_win->attr.height);
#ifdef WINDOWSHADE
  }
#endif
-----
After patching these lines, shading runs good without
any errors.

Thanks.  I've tried it and it does exactly as you say.  I've made this
change to my all changes diff and put it in andrew5.2.0.44.diff.gz (with
change diff) in:

This seems like the biggest problem with fvwm-2.0.44 right now. Is anybody
looking at why this doesn't work?

Also, the AutoRaise problem hasn't been fixed in regards to menus: if
you pop-down a menu, then the AutoRaise delay expires, the window is
raised and obscures the menu. Isn't there any way to fix this?

The other problem is if a user doesn't have a .fvwm2rc file, it complains
that it can't find it OR the system.fvwm2rc file, even though the
system.fvwm2rc file DOES exist. This needs to be fixed before I can install
it on our machines as well, since not everyone has a ~/.fvwm2rc...

Finally, something that needs to be fixed in Fvwm.tmpl: in order for
the Solaris dynamic linker to find the X libraries, I needed to change
the FvwmModuleTarget and FvwmProgramTarget from '$(CC) -o $@...' to
'$(CCLINK) -o $@...'. This is very important! It makes sure the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH gets set before the link so the dynamic linker can find
the X libraries. Prior to making this change, 'fvwm2' would not run,
with the linker complaining about not be able to find the X libraries,
and 'ldd' confirmed it. I tracked it down to this oversight in 'Fvwm.tmpl'.
Can this be fixed?

Also, I'm fairly certain I've applied all the patches (the placement.c
patch, all the patches from andrew [up to andrew4], got the new FvwmIconMan,
and the new FvwmAuto and FvwmAudio updates) that have been released to date,
but it would be nice to maybe release an "fvwm-2.0.44.1" (or something)
once things settle down that includes all the patches, some Decor samples,
etc...

I just spent a while trying to decipher the new stuff, including Decor.

I think one of the reasons it's confusing is that it's not clear at all
what the distinction between a Decor and a Style is, when you should use
one or the other, and basically why they are two different things and
what each is good for.

Also, it seems that everything _except_ Style has gone to the new
"AddTo" format (with the "+" lines), which is inconsistent.

And why is there only one AddToFunc, AddToMenu, AddToDecor, but there's
a distinction between ButtonStyle and AddButtonStyle?  I don't get that.

And, as I said before, some of the syntax uses this new (), --, !
notation and some doesn't (like Style doesn't use !, it has multiple
values for the opposite "flag" types).  That's also confusing.

Why do you define the colors to HilightColor as <c1> <c2>, but the
colors to the Style Color option as <c1>/<c2>?  There's just a lot of
inconsistency and even some redundancy, I think, in the config file
language now.

I think that somewhere there needs to be a very short overview: "Use
ButtonStyle to define buttons on the window frame border; use
AddButtonStyle to modify attributes of an existing ButtonStyle; use
AddToDecor to make a new Decor; use UseDecor to apply a Decor to a
Style; use UseStyle to `duplicate' a style", etc.

Also, someone should to rewrite the system.fvwmrc file to maybe use
Decor and/or Style "correctly" as an example; here's how I changed my
~/.fvwm2rc (obviously, comments more than welcome :) after I (think I)
figured out Decor and UseStyle:

  ### Standard Window Configuration

  AddToDecor Standard
  +       HilightColor    Black DeepSkyBlue
  +       WindowFont      -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
  +       ButtonStyle 1   ActiveUp (Pixmap fvwm2/mini.destroy.xpm) \
                          ActiveDown (Pixmap fvwm95/mini-exp.xpm) \
                          Inactive (Pixmap fvwm2/mini.destroy-alt.xpm)
  +       ButtonStyle 2   Pixmap fvwm2/mini.maximize-vert.xpm
  +       ButtonStyle 4   MiniIcon

  Style Standard  UseDecor Standard, \
                  BorderWidth 5, Color LightSkyBlue2/RoyalBlue4, \
                  DecorateTransient, HintOverride, \
                  Icon fvwm2/default.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/jball.xpm, \
                  StickyIcon, IconBox 3 -20 -1 -1, \
                  RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement, \
                  MWMDecor, MWMFunctions

  Style Naked     WindowListSkip, Sticky, NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0


  ### Application-specific decoration styles and window options

  Style "*"           UseStyle Standard

  # FVWM Modules

  Style "Fvwm*"       UseStyle Naked
  Style "FvwmTalk"    WindowListHit,  Slippery, Title, BorderWidth 5
  Style "FvwmConsole" WindowListHit,  Slippery, Title, BorderWidth 5
  Style "Tkgoodstuff" UseStyle Naked

  # Individual application styles & icons

  Style "*faces"      UseStyle Naked, StaysOnTop
  Style "*lock"       UseStyle Naked
  Style "XSysStats"   UseStyle Naked
  Style "XMcd"	      UseStyle Naked

  Style "ical_alarm"  StaysOnTop

  Style "*XTerm"      MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.xterm.xpm
  Style "XTerm"       Icon x/xterm-basic.xpm
  Style "rootXTerm"   Icon t/term2.xpm
  Style "sysXTerm"    Icon t/term2.xpm
  Style "rxvt"        Icon t/term2.xpm

  Style "xman"	      Icon x/xman.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.xman.xpm

  Style "Tgif"        Icon desc/cl-48/draw.xpm
  Style "Xarchie"     Icon x/xarchie.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.xarchie.xpm
  Style "Mosaic"      Icon w/www-shape.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.netscape.xpm
  Style "Netscape"    MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.netscape.xpm
  Style "Emacs"	      Icon g/gnu.xpm, MiniIcon fvwm2/mini.gnu.xpm

This, obviously, is not my whole config, but it's all the decor/style
part.

Basically I create a "Standard" Decor and a "Standard" Style (that uses
the Standard decor), then I define all windows to use the Standard Style.

Then I have another Style, Naked, that I use for apps that have no
border (button bars, CD player, XFaces, etc.)

The idea, I guess, is I could make other Styles and/or Decors and switch
them pretty easily.

Well, anyway, FWIW.

On a quick look (it's 0:26) my FvwmAuto doesn't do that.

       3    | 2		  |

move from 1 over 2 to 3, open menu, before 2 is raised,
(menu overlaps both windows just a little bit, so you can tell the exact
order)
stay in menu as long as you like, nothing is raised over the menu.
exit menu -> 2 is raised over 1.

The raise is delayed until the menu is closed, no strange behaviour found.

I still have to rename all FvwmManPath settings to FvwmManDir settings,
but X11R4 is the least common denominator here (mix of X11R4, R5 & R6 sun

So this could be our local setup.

so there's a new Auto & Audio (dateed Jan 18th) out there right now, but
only minor fixies. :-)
SO THERE !

we're all hoping for a new synced release.
(andrew hasn't made any upgrade patches for his andrew3.2.0.44.diff, which
I applied to my working tree. - guess I'll have to do it by hand, or wait
for 2.0.45 or 2.0.44.1)

I guess I should have been more clear: I meant a menu from a Motif
application, like Netscape or Z-Mail, where I can reproduce it every time.
Fvwm-generated menus appear to work correctly, as you describe.

Also, I just remembered another bug that hasn't been fixed yet: on machines
with more than one display, if you move your mouse from one display to
the other, and in the process move over a window that is not the top window,
the last window you "touched" with the mouse on the display your moving off
of is raised, even though you did not focus on it! It is very annoying. :-(

This is what you need to do:

        1

 |      2      |
 |             |

Put the mouse in 1 (which is probably the root window), make sure window 2
doesn't have focus, move the mouse to window 2, make a pop-up menu appear
BEFORE the autorase timeout.  Window 2 will raise above the pop-up.  I know
where the bug is in fvwm, it's not FvwmAuto's fault.  When FvwmAuto tells fvwm
to raise window 2, like it should, fvwm alters the stacking order something
like:

Bottom
1.  window 2
2.  window 2's transients  (netscape open URL window, _not_ a menu)
3.  StatysOnTop windows
Top

All other windows, which includes pop-menu windows, will be moved below window
2.  Somenow fvwm needs to know:

a) that the pop-up window is part of window 2, and that it should always be
   above window 2. 
b) that window 2 and it's children shouldn't change their relative stacking
   order.
c) that pop-up windows should always go on the very top

I would like c, as sometimes a pop-up appears under FvwmButtons or xload and I
can't see it.  However I don't know how to tell if a window is a pop-up, or
how to get fvwm to know about all those pop-up windows.  It seems that pop-up's
aren't reparented to the window manager like other top-level windows.

because the AddButtonStyle part was added by Andrew (minimal change

features, but Chuck simply didn't include it. - lots of parsing bugs
could simply be fixed by modifying MatchToken and CmpToken)

chuck is working on it. I hope he'll use the ! instead of the
unreadable "NoNormal", "Normal", "OnlyNormal", for WindowList again.

I did it like this originally (my WindowList rewrite)
	+ or & means: this option is required,
	- or ! means: this option is rejected (required to be off)
	     . means: don't care for this option
it was "too unreadable" :-)

anyway. Chuck should make his decision and stay with it throughout all
of .fvwm2rc.

e.g: you can say

I was always wondering about that one :-)

so what exactly is the difference between a decor & a style, as they
both affect appearance of a window ?

decor seems to be the complex options (with parameters or lots of data),
	while
styles are mostly binary options (small parameters)

Why not UseStyle & CopyStyle ?

I don't see them as orthogonal concepts, anyway.


But besides all these inconsistencies & deficiencies:
fvwm2.0.44 is a lot more consistent than the previous versions.
Many changes have taken place which didn't even touch the surface.
Yet they were even more important than some of the bug fixes and added
features. Chuck has done a very good job in keeping the project running.

The reason that some things have gone global is because there aren't any
more style flags (yet).  There is a slight confusion between Style and
ButtonStyle, for example, but this is due to the flag limitation, which is
to be addressed by Chuck after version 2.1.

Many of the things you've mentioned I've been forced to think about at one
time or another during implementation, but factors which caused me to make
certain decisions include backwards compatibility, practicality, and being
able to _not_ use any of the options (most important).

> And why is there only one AddToFunc, AddToMenu, AddToDecor, but there's

Functions, menus and decors do not belong to anything.  They are only
assigned or called from other things.  In this respect, they are global.
Button/title/border styles belong to decors.

It's not entirely consisitent, but once you get the hang of it it's not
bad.  I did this since it made code a bit smaller and more convienent.
Might be something too look into after 2.1.x though -- more consolidation
of parsing.

HilightColor has always been like that, unless someone changes it.  There
has always been a lot of inconsistency and redundancy, and it won't go
:-).  Part of the problem is retaining some sense of backward
compatibility for fvwm2. 

You can't expect perfection -- no one works on this stuff full-time (also
it would take much longer :-).  These things are meant to be practical,
i.e., you write something in the RC and it operates in a particular
manner.  If you want more you could always go with gwm or something.  If I
wrote a window manager from scratch I'd probably include something close
to a Turing-complete language written in lex/yacc.

The main reason that for example ButtonStyle has become somewhat complex
is simple:  it still works with original button definitions.

> I think that somewhere there needs to be a very short overview: "Use

> AddToDecor to make a new Decor; use UseDecor to apply a Decor to a
> Style; use UseStyle to `duplicate' a style", etc.

This is reasonable, and I think would probably be most effective.  Let me
see if I can come up with a man page section for that.  If you can, I'll
send it to you for comments.

I really didn't think there would be as much interest in this Decor stuff
when I wrote it.  It is just a feature, and you can use it or ditch it.
However, since do seem to be interested, the future is wide open.

The idea behind UseDecor is that you can make sets of window
title/button/border/windowfont/hilightcolors and assign them to any
window.  That's it.  It's a lot of stuff which does take some time getting
used to. 

I wouldn't expect anyone to understand everything in one day about decors
any more than I'd expect anyone learning everything about Emacs in 1 year. 
I wrote the Decor stuff and even I haven't learned everything about it;
I've seen examples which I've never thought of being posted recently.

Let me see if I can explain the AddButtonStyle to you a bit more.  Imagine
a stack of styles, each painted on top of one another.  If I give a
ButtonStyle command with a style in there, than it clears the stack; i.e.:

ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue

This would give me a solid blue button.  Say I wanted a pixmap over that
blue button.  Then I can say: 

AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm

And say I wanted a second left justified pixmap over that, yielding a
stack which holds three styles: 

AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left

Then, a fourth style say is added, which is the default vector button of
button 3:

AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3

Resulting in the full definition (this does the same thing for all button
states since no state is specified for any definition):

ButtonStyle 1 Solid Blue
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap a.xpm
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap b.xpm -- left
AddButtonStyle 1 Default 3

That's it.  The same is possible with TitleStyle if EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE is
enabled. 

Say I wanted to use the TitleStyle for button 1 without clearing the
abutton stack:

ButtonStyle 1 -- UseTitleStyle

To get rid of UseTitleStyle

ButtonStyle 1 -- !UseTitleStyle

True, some examples are needed.  But the problem is that these things are
quite flexible, and I could give you a pretty simple example as above or a
very complex one.  I guess the key would be to get as many examples as
possible.  But someone has to make an example repository. 

It would be nice if someone could setup some sort of fvwm2 example
repository with a http inteface (seriously!). 

The main thing right now is to fix bugs; this is the only the first beta
release of the decor stuff in fvwm2 :-).

the transient flag ?
It must be in the DecorateTransient code.


Just sort all transient windows to the top, without changing their relative
order ? Ignore the top part of the stack on reorders?

Fvwm does that, except it seems that pop-up menu ins't a "transient" window.

I've put my rc setup here:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/andrewrc.tar.gz .

It is nothing special, as I prefer fairly plain setups (there are no
pixmaps, and I had to stick some gradients in to make it more interesting
:-), but the schemes might be of interest (all of the W95 color schemes
are included -- ugh :-). 

You should have the andrew5.2.0.44.diff.gz patch to use the rc setup (this
is in the same directory as the above file). 

Enjoy,
Andrew

Hey all,

I've noticed some discussion on the list about various FVWM configs... I
used to have a decent collection of them, but I accidentally deleted the
directory, and searching the Web didn't seem to turn them up (which is
really annoying me... where did I get the damn things?!). 

Anyway, what I'd like is as many config files as you lot can e-mail me (or
send Web pointers to), preferably with comments (in the rc-file that is),
and including the names of any special pixmap collections you used. What
I'd like to be able to do is to set up a webpage explaining the various
parts of the FVWM config file and how to customise it for various looks. I
know about the Dotfile Generator, but I happen to think that a detailed
explanation of what each part of the file does, with graphical examples and
what have you, would be really useful to people trying to draw up their own
FVWM configs. 

I don't care what the result of your rc-file looks like -- Win95, NeXT,
Amiga, or even DECwindows, as long as it says if it's supposed to look like
a particular interface. Also, mention some of the system details if you
think they're pertinent (eg, designed for 8 bit display). 

If someone's already done a page like this that I'm not aware of, please
let me know, so I don't make a complete fool out of myself :)

Cheers
Alexis

I'm a Linux user and maybe it's just voodoo or amazing luck, but I find
Netscrape to be incredibly reliable...

I did briefly encounter a crashing spree, though, when I had xpm-3.4h
(and/or the version of the xpm library installed by the Red Hat Motif CD)
installed.  This version of xpm would cause motif to wipe out whenever an
error dialog was being displayed.

So, if you're having netscape crashes, try upgrading to xpm-3.4i and the
problem might go away.

It's a mildly confusing FEATURE, but a feature nevertheless...  All of the

Put your default style for all XTerms first instead of last and you should
get the behavior that you desire.

I just completed upgrading to 2.0.44 from 2.0.43. FvwmAuto only works
once.

here is the relevant section of .fvwm2rc:

DeskTopSize 2x2
MenuStyle Grey80 #505050 Grey50 -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
fvwm
ClickTime 750
OpaqueMoveSize 100
FvwmAuto 750 
ColormapFocus FollowsMouse

When first started or restarted, the module seems to work. I restarted
with several different argument values and got a reasonable response.
Howver once the module pops up a window the timout becomes very short,
or the module unloads (how do I tell?) 

I diffed the code from FvwmAuto 2.0.44 with the version from 2.0.43, but
the code is way over my head. I tried to recompile the the new FvwmAuto
with the old libfvwm2.a and the new FvwmAuto with the old library, but
neither would compile.

The .fvwm2rc worked fine under 2.0.43 for several months.

Okay, I added that in and it works just fine. I have to be careful which 
windows I use it on though as I have a different decor for xterms so that 
if I use this function, they'll revert to Default decor instead of xterm
decor... Can anyone think of a way around this?  

Also what does that last ChangeDecor "Default" do?

I have just downloaded and compiled FVWM version 2.0.44 and have a quick 
question about the .fvwm2rc configuration file. 
 
It seems that after a normal compile the window title bars no longer get the 
background color set properly. In version 2.0.43 I was able to successfully 
use the HilightColor option to set the background to grey and the foreground 
to black. Note that since I am using a black and white NCD x-terminal I don't 
have the option of using colors. 
 
After installing 2.0.44 I don't seem to be able to get any background title 
bar colors except white. I assume that this may have something to do with the 
new titlestyle and userdecor options but am not sure. 
 
Does anyone have a suggestion/work-around to get the active window's title bar 
to stand out so that I can see which one is active or is there a bug in the 
HiLightColor option now that does not allow for greyscale colors??? 
 
Please reply directly to me as I am not on the mailing list. 
 
Thanks,

To: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Dear fvwm list members:

I am considering installing fvwm Digital Unix 3.2 and Ultrix 4.4 hosts on our
network.

Version 1 seemingly works properly on Ultrix 4.4 hosts. Version 2 ditto on
Digital Unix hosts. I would like to make fvwm available to our rather
unsophisticated users without the further confusion of 2 versions (user
directories are available through NFS on both kinds of hosts). I would like to
choose one of them but:

-- Ultrix does not seem to come with imake (the FAQ has some info about this
problem with HP-UX but not Ultrix).

-- version 2 binaries from the X User Tools O'Reilly book/cd get into some
GoodStuff related trouble. The sources for 1.24r seem so far rather
uncooperative for compilation.

Can someone please supply some pratical advice?

Thanks for your time,

It sets up the initial "state" -- actually, since "default" is the
default state, it's not really needed.



On the subject of decors, I've come up with functions that will provide
a MWM- type and Win95- type windows (including redefining how the mouse
will work on each button).

My only real experience with mwm was in the early 1.0 phase, so somebody
may have a better "look" (mostly colors) for how my Mwm style works.

I've MIME-attached my .fvwm-decors file (which is read by my .fvwm2rc
file).
I've already sent my win95-*.xpm files to this list.  Maybe one day I'll
get around to putting this stuff on a web site, but don't hold your
breath...!

AddToDecor	Default
+	TitleStyle	LeftJustified ActiveUp (Solid Navy -- flat) \
			ActiveDown (Solid Navy -- flat) \
			Inactive (Solid grey51 -- flat)
+	HilightColor	white grey60

Style "*"	UseDecor Default, ForeColor Black


This will give your ACTIVE windows a navy blue background and a white
foreground.  Your inactive windows will have a grey51 background and a
black background.

I agree that figuring out which properties affected what was not
intuitive, and took a LOT of figuring out.  My process was to use tkman
to display the fvwm2 man page, search for the word 'color' and tinker
with each thing until things started to look right.

Maybe for the release, the "titlestyle" could specify foreground AND
background colors.  Of course, that could adversely affect the
UseTitleStyle option in the ButtonStyle commands (but that's left for
the maintainers).

In a pinch:

- TitleStyle sets the background colors.
- HilightColor sets the foreground color for active windows
- ForeColor Style option sets the foreground color for inactive windows.

Confused?  So was I.  [smile]

Hi folks,

I am using a monochrome X-terminal connected to a Sun (SunOS 4.1.3).
Monochome really means two colors: black and white, no grayscales.

Version 2.0.43 handled this beautifully: It used a fine dither to make
gray window borders (and kept the title readable by writing it on a
white background.)

Version 2.0.44 no longer does this, the borders are just white.  Not
nearly as nice.  Is this a bug, or is there a good reason?  I feel it
is a small step backwards, but I realise that monochrome users may not
be the highest priority.

Best regards,

Jakob

I don't _think_ any of this is necessary.  I moved to 2.0.44 and my
"old" (2.0.42) ~/.fvwm2rc file worked just fine; my titles, etc. all
appeared exactly the same as before without changing anything (e.g., I
had:

  # Colors for non-selected windows
  Style "*" Color LightSkyBlue2/RoyalBlue4

  # Colors for selected windows
  HilightColor Black DeepSkyBlue

and it worked great).

I think Mike's problem is that something actually broke when supporting
B&W X servers (note Jakob's message as well).

Hi!
I jusst installed fvwm2.44 on SunOs 4.1.3_U1.

And there is a problem when fvwm started...
I mean that when fvwm started no one window is shown, and no one menu command
could be executed.
The screen is filled with default color, menu could be seen, but results of any
exec command from menu is unavaluable.
When I do restart fvwm everithing is return and works fine.

Here is InitFunction:

######################## Initialization Functions ############################
AddToFunc InitFunction 	"I" Module FvwmButtons
+ "I" Exec /usr/local/bin/zmail -gui -zcnlserv andromeda
+ "I" Exec $XPATH/plan -iconic
+ "I" Wait plan
+ "I" Desk 0 1
+ "I" run_emacs_sol fogo
+ "I" Wait Emacs
+ "I" Desk 0 0


The help is required ;)

Actually, that's what I thought. The problem with that line is that it 
waits for the user to click on a window for it to change the decor. 

I've also noticed something else. You can't make two windows sticky 
one after the other and change the decor at the same time as making the 
first one sticky switches the SwitchDecor function to revert to the default
decor. So if you try and make a second window change decor, it becomes sticky
but keeps the default decor. This could get kind of confusing. 

I'm going to make one of my outlandish non-programmer type 
suggestions here:

Currently sticky windows have those nice grooves along the title bar
so presumably some bit of code somewhere recognizes the fact that 
it's sticky and slaps them over the top regardless of decor. Would it 
be possible to adapt this to pick up a Decor at the same time. This could 
be a reserved Decor called "Sticky" which unless defined is the same as 
"Default" but with the grooves. However, if defined by the user, any window 
that becomes sticky, picks up the new decor (and the grooves), and then reverts when unstuck. This could be just a colour change, or something really poncy, 
depending upon the user.

Ridiculous suggestion over.

Just don't get rid of the grooves, please.

Cheers 

	Martin.

I think that the problem is definately in a problem with B&W monitors. 
 
It seems that I have tracked down the problem a little. If I compile FVWM 
without the EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE option then greyscales work properly. Sounds 
like a bug here but I can't say for sure. 
 
Anyone care to give me some suggestions?? 
 
Thanks,

AddToDecor	Default
+	TitleStyle	LeftJustified ActiveUp (Solid Navy -- flat) \
			ActiveDown (Solid Navy -- flat) \
			Inactive (Solid grey51 -- flat)
+	HilightColor	white grey60

Style "*"	UseDecor Default, ForeColor Black


This will give your ACTIVE windows a navy blue background and a white
foreground.  Your inactive windows will have a grey51 background and a
black background.

I agree that figuring out which properties affected what was not
intuitive, and took a LOT of figuring out.  My process was to use tkman
to display the fvwm2 man page, search for the word 'color' and tinker
with each thing until things started to look right.

Maybe for the release, the "titlestyle" could specify foreground AND
background colors.  Of course, that could adversely affect the
UseTitleStyle option in the ButtonStyle commands (but that's left for
the maintainers).

In a pinch:

- TitleStyle sets the background colors.
- HilightColor sets the foreground color for active windows
- ForeColor Style option sets the foreground color for inactive windows.

Confused?  So was I.  [smile]

I have two questions:

Is it possible to set up FvwmIconMan so that while the mouse is in the
FvwmIconMan list, whatever window the cursor is "on" in the list has focus?
This makes it easy to change focus (especially with click to focus)
without clicking on windows all over the display. You can simply nudge
the mouse up or down a few pixels and focus on whatever window you have
the mouse pointing at. Obviously this might not work well for some
people who constantly bump the mouse, but 'twm' supports something like
this, and it is quite useful.

Second, I still cannot figure out how to resize a window when in
ActivePlacement mode when I have the 3x3 grid. In every other window
manager I know of, clicking-and-dragging allows you to resize the window,
and releasing the button actually places it. I can't get this to work in
fvwm2, .43 or .44. Is is because I'm overriding some functionality with
my function definitions, or is this not possible in fvwm2?

remove this and all _should_ be fine.
I had the same problem when I first upgraded, and I had seen something about
"the infamouse Wait bug". When I removed the "Wait" statements from my startup,
everything worked just dandy.

Funny, I never tried the restart. Oh well. Live and learn!

Quite possible. Just make a binding like:

*FvwmIconMan*action	Select	sendcommand select select Focus

In FvwmIconMan lingo, select means to move the mouse into a button. This has
FvwmIconMan send the command "Focus" to the currently selected window. The
syntax is horrible I admit, but I haven't had the energy to come up with
something better. 

Slight problem is that with fvwm, if you Focus a window, it will raise it as
well. I used to release a patch which made Focus just focus, but it's a bit
out of date now. If you want to do it youself, just comment out the lines:

  RaiseWindow(t);
  KeepOnTop();

  /* If the window is still not visible, make it visible! */
  if(((t->frame_x + t->frame_height)< 0)||(t->frame_y + t->frame_width < 0)||
     (t->frame_x >Scr.MyDisplayWidth)||(t->frame_y>Scr.MyDisplayHeight))
  {
    SetupFrame(t,0,0,t->frame_width, t->frame_height,False);
    if(!(t->flags & ClickToFocus))
      XWarpPointer(dpy, None, Scr.Root, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2,2);
  }
  UngrabEm();

at the end of the function FocusOn in builtins.c.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

(I hope this is the right mailing list -- apologies if it is not...)

I retrieved the 2.0.44 on Friday of last week and have it compiled and running on both
Sparc and Intel Solaris-2.5.1.  On the Sparc side, no problems (yet, anyway); however,
on the Intel platform (same .fvwm2rc file on both, same locations, etc.), the "rubber
bands" which used to show up under 2.0.43 and earlier versions are gone.  This includes both
the outlines which appear when moving and the outline+"grid" which appears when resizing a
window such as an xterm.

On the x86 machine, I first compiled with the SunPro compiler (-xO3 for optimization) and then
discovered the problem.  So I went back and compiled without optimization to see if I was getting
an optimizer bug, and the results were identical.  Finally, I used gcc-2.7.2 with no optimization
and the same thing still occurs.  On the solaris-x86 platform the results are the same whether
I am running the Openlook server or XFree86 (x11r6.3).

I have not been able to track this one down yet -- has anyone seen this one before, and/or does
anybody have any suggestions?

Thanks,

I made a change to the default XORValue (from 255 to 1, which works a
little better when visual depth == 8), and visuals that are depth > 8
apparently like 255 better...

Just put the old value into your .fvwm2rc file to take care of that
little problem (XORValue 255).

Cool. I just got it set up and I like it! :-) There is only one problem:
FvwmIconMan goes nuts if 'unclutter' is running. In case you don't know,
unclutter is a cool little utility that hides the mouse pointer after so
many seconds of no mouse movement. Basically, after the unclutter timeout
expires (and the mouse is in FvwmIconMan, so it was responsible for maintaing
the focus on the window the mouse was pointing at) the focus rapidly comes
and goes from the window, until you move the mouse and make the cursor
appear again. If the unclutter timer expires when the mouse is not in
FvwmIconMan, it works fine. It is only when I use the mouse in FvwmIconMan
to select focus that I have a problem... any ideas?

Hmm. It would be nice if this were a user-settable option, like "RaiseOnFocus".

Very odd. unclutter must be doing something which is generating some sort of X
event like MotionNotify or EnterNotify. 

I just use sloppy focus, and I move the cursor to the root window if it's in
my way.

Well, it sort of is. Originally, Focus warped the cursor to the window, as
well as raising it. I then proposed a WarpToWindow function which would warp
the cursor to a given window, and making Focus just focus, and nothing else.
Cause then with WarpToWindow, RaiseWindow, and the new trim Focus, you could 
make a fvwm function which would emulate the old Focus behavior if you really
liked it. The WarpToWindow function was added, and Focus stopped warping the
cursor, but it still raised the window. That was 2.0.43 I think. 

Something to think about after 2.0 gets oficially released.

Unclutter works by creating a small (1x1, I think) window that's of the
same color as the pixel behind it, and making the mouse cursor enter that
window and beocme tranparent or something. So maybe FvwmIconMan is
noticing that the mouse is effectivly leaving its window when unclutter
activates?

The original poster may want to try the -grab option to unclutter and see
if that works better.

Just to let you know, I can reproduce the core dump with the following:

Mouse   0       5       A       DoWindowShade
 
DestroyFunc DoWindowShade
AddToFunc   DoWindowShade "I"     DoWindowShadeUp
 
DestroyFunc DoWindowShadeUp
AddToFunc   DoWindowShadeUp
+       "I"     DestroyFunc DoWindowShade
+       "I"     AddToFunc DoWindowShade "I" DoWindowShadeDown
 
DestroyFunc DoWindowShadeDown
AddToFunc   DoWindowShadeDown
+       "I"     DestroyFunc DoWindowShade
+       "I"     AddToFunc DoWindowShade "I" DoWindowShadeUp

I've examined the crash and there is some problem with ComplexFunction.
In other words, it has nothing to do with Decors or WindowShade (just to
let you know).  I'll look into the problem further if I have some time.

To follow-up, I'm not going to look into this further, but I think your
crashing it by destroying a function you are currently calling (i.e. your
mouse binding is bound to DoWindowShade which calls a function which
destroys DoWindowShade -- what does the function return to :-) !).  This
to me seems like a faulty rc setup (in the same vein as if you call a
function recursively).

	Hi all, bussy people

I just observed for the tenth or twelfth time a strange (and annoying)
comportment of XEmacs occuring after the 2.0.44 install. I hadn't the
time to pay attention to it though not more the time to try to trace
it down (or even isolate it). My message for now is to try to see if
somebody else pinned-down some similar bug:

If I have an (or multiple) XEmacs window(s) opened and I do a Restart
of fvwm2, I get stuck with those windows because they don't get
anymore input. I mean they can get focus, but mouse click/commands and
keyboard input seems not active. STRANGE. The only work around (really
VERY annoying) is to close all XEmacs windows and to start a new
session.

With 2.0.43 this dosen't exist. There was a similar (but in some sort
smaller) problem with GNUS, which did not display sometimes if it was
on another desktop than the visible one during GNUS start. I think
this problem was largely discussed in fvwm and XEmacs groups but I
missed the solution.

Howevewr, I would like to know if anybody else noticed this
comportment.

Thanks a lot

				Friendly yours, Cristian

Thanks, that (almost) solved the problem.  The buttons in the titlebar
are still white though. It looks funny, but doesn't really matter.  At
least I can now see which window has focus :-)

When compiling without the EXTENDED_TITLESTYLE option there is still a
minor bug left from 2.0.43:  After a fvwm restart, the title bars are
strange (they contain whatever was under them) until the window gets
focus first time.

Thanks for the help,

Jakob

I'm still using 2.0.43 and occasionally see your symptoms.  My
workaround is to iconify and deiconify the XEmacs windows.  At this
stage it is apparent that that XEmacs had acted on the input but that
no output had happened (or maybe the input was queued somewhere).

Should anyone be interested I see two other problems with XEmacs.  In
Ediff the controlling window is often too big.  Sometimes hitting ?
twice (making the box "larger", then "normal" again) will fix it.  It
looks like there is some sort of race condition.

The second was reported by me on 29 Oct 1996.  XEmacs is initially
slow and may misinterpret a single mouse click as multiple.  Switching
to and from twm works around the problem.

Hi,

Anyone out there help me / comment on the following?



I am trying to introduce a small user group to the delights of fvwm
and several users have come back with a resizing problem.   We are using
Sun Sparc and Ultra-Sparcs with Solaris 2.5.1 and attempting to use
fvwm-2.0.43 instead of dtwm as manager.   Cntl+Mouse3 in a /usr/openwin/bin
/xterm window gives a menu where you can reset the font for the current
xterm:

   VT Fonts
Default
Unreadable
Tiny
Small
:
:

In all bar the "Unreadable" case, the two window managers behave the same;
the whole window is resized in proportion to the font and returns to 
normal when the Default is subsequently selected.

The "Unreadable" ( which is VERY SMALL ) behaves the same on dtwm but
fvwm, although returning to the default size and Font, is blank over the
"resized" width.

|abcdef ghijk lmn  |     |:::: |     |abc                |

|abcdef ghijk lmn  |                 |abc                |

|                  |                 |                   |
--------------------                 ---------------------

The users have numerous actively scrolling xterms at one time and tend
to use this "shrinking" procedure to allow them to get an overview of
these windows ( say 10 ) on the right hand side of the screen, while
working on other things.  When a task completes they can then "regain"
the window for review.

As I said, all the other fonts seem to behave ok except this very small
one.  Is this fvwm?  Is there a resource file option ( fontlist etc )
problem?

Any help or advice would be gratefully received.

tells you if FvwmAuto still lives.

I guess it still lives, but please tell me, if it does.



My FvwmAuto still works fine (I use FocusFollowsMouse):

AddToFunc RestartFunction "I"	Module	FvwmButtons
+			"I"	Module	FvwmAuto 500
+			"I"	Next [emacs] focus



ctibirna@gch.ulaval.ca already reported this bug, I looked through the
code, found a possible hole in the logic, if you used ClickToFocus 
(do you ?) and published a new version at

 	<URL:http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~albrecht/FvwmAuto.c.gz>
(this version also fixes a possible bug for timeouts >1000 ms :-) )

He said it still didn't work and didn't reply since, so I'm somewhat
hanging in the air.

please try the new code & if it doesn't work, add

	#define DEBUG

in the first line and mail me the output.


you could also change the #if 1 in line 152 to a #if 0
this replaces the smaller condition by explicit coding:
I suspected a compiler bug when evaluating this expression, but Cristian
Tibirna didn't reply to my message, yet.
If this fixes the bug, please tell me what compiler you use.

I thought focus doesn't raise the window?
hmm....

well it does (from the source).

maybe we should change that?

we already ripped the mouse-warping from the focus function, why not the
raise, too?


you can always call a user-defined fvwmFunction, which does focus & raise
the window.

Chuck, what do you think?

BTW: the raise_it function - now obsolete - is still defined  in
builtins.c & function.c

NOOOO please don't do that !!!
rip raise from focus & let the user choose, if he uses MyFocus (does
focus/raise) or Focus !!

it's a two-line change in builtin.c, but many .fvwm2rc's will have to be

I'd put it in 2.0.45, but Chuck has to decide.

Shall I butcher focus & mail a patch?

I use xemacs. I had this problem under 2.0.43. It seems to be better
since 2.0.44. I can't say that it's fixed, as I've only used .44 for
two days. I _can_ say that it _appears_ to be much worse (ie., happen
more often) when I have tkGoodStuff running (as a module). I've
stopped using tkGoodStuff (for other reasons), and it has not happened
as often (even under .43). One clue to this is that I was using a
win95-style taskbar config with tkGoodStuff, and also had a FvwmPager
running. I don't know if tkGoodStuff launches its own FvwmPager, but
might there be a problem with two pagers running?

Noticed this one also.

Havn't seen this, but I don't have much to compare it with.  I can
only compare my linux/fvwm system to an HP /712, but the two systems
are substantially different (ie., the HP does only 8 bpp, the linux
system does 16, etc.)

I just ran into a small bug:

It is not possible to use the "new" method of specifying colors
(rgb:rr/gg/bb instead of #rrggbb) with the "Color foreground/background"
notation, probably because of the conflict with the slashes. Not sure
what the solution is (I've switched back to using ForeColor & BackColor
for now) but I just thought I'd mention it.


Unfortunately I still haven't received any replies on these pending
problems. I'd love to see these patched before I finally release 2.0.44
to "production":

-- The 'Wait' problem. This is a bummer because I use "Wait FvwmButtons"
   to make sure some "early" windows have been placed before I call
   "Exec xterm", and without the Wait, some windows end up on top of each
   other.

-- The auto-raise bug that occurs when switching monitors (the last window
   you touched on the display you are moving off is raised, even though it
   doesn't have focus and never did).

-- A missing ~/.fvwm2rc file causes fvwm-2.0.44 to complain that both the
   .fvwmrc and system.fvwm2rc file are missing...

-- Still can't figure out how to size a window when the 3x3 "placement
   grid" is active...

-- The auto-raising of windows that have menus popped-up causes them to be
   obscured. This sounds like it is difficult to fix, since there is no way
   to know that a "window" is really a menu.

I am going to begin looking at these things myself if I get a little bit of
free time.

Oh, and while I'm writing:

I'd love to see a patch to disable "raise" on focus, and definitely think
this should be the default behavior (since it can be so easily changed with
a custom "MyRaise" function as pointed out by Albrecht).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The fix I developed to prevent FvwmButtons looping isn't in 2.0.44,
unfortunately; I came in this morning to find it doing just that.

In addition, a patch to enable FvwmButtons to recognize old-style
'SwallowModule' configuration lines also didn't make it.

(The signal handling patch for fvwm itself is there, though).

A patch to FvwmButtons suitable for 2.0.44 is attached.

Hello,

It seems, that there is a bug in the new fvwm2 version 2.0.44.
The problem is, that fvwm hangs if I use Wait in the InitFunction.
When I comment it out my InitFunction works. I have used version 2.0.43
too and my .fvwm2rc file works for the former version. I dont know if
the error depends on my X-Server or OS. I use SunOS4 and X11 R6.
This is my InitFunction:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
+ "I" Exec rxvt   -geometry 80x9+140+0 +vb -fn fixed -C -ls -title

#+ "I" Wait rxvt

+ "I" Exec LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib/$OSTYPE:/opt/X11R6/lib xman  
-geometry 110x60-245+0
+ "I" Refresh

Fvwm stops on the first Wait and waits forever. But I can use the menu
on the root and when I choose Restart, all programs before the first
wait come up.

Ok, I bit the bullet and started playing with the new decor
options. Why does every configuration I come up with look a lot like
Win95? ;)

(That last sentence was a JOKE, just in case you missed the smiley.)

Here are some semi-serious thoughts:

Is it just me, or should ButtonStyle have something like

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon Flat
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap foo.xpm Sunk
ButtonStyle 3 Pixmap 

I like to use pixmaps, but now that we have TitleStyle ... Flat, I'm
ready to give up the bevel'd look.

Also, Maybe I could come up with some alternatives to the Win95 look
if BorderStyle NoInset worked by itself rather than as an option to
HiddenHandles. I'd like to have no inset, but still see the
handles....

I'll get a mono server out this weekend and try to straighten out the mono
weirdness.

fvwm 2.0.44 hangs if 'Wait' is used in a InitFunction/RestartFunction.
However, this bug(?) is already fixed (maybe). Try this patch.

=09Hi, Albrecht

I'm sorry for forgetting to reply as you repeated in your response to
Craig.

Actually I came back very late saturday night (sunday morning at 4:00!?
:-) so I temporised my report and after that I forgot, for the good
reason that I took in reuse the version of FvwmAuto from 2.0.43, as
compiled inthere. 

I spoke with Criag Sunday night, when I thought you're offline. And I
told to him what I intended to say to you too: the syntax rearranging
hasn't any effect. I almost knew it before to  try it. I use Linux
2.0.27 with gcc & g++ 2.7.2.1, libg++ 2.7.1.4 and libc 5.3.12. So I
was confident. But, as I told to Craig, I suspect the problem isn't
really in FvwmAuto. Why I think that? Because FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
it functions. I raises the first window it enters AFTER the imposed
delay.

After that, I think the variable which holds the value which is passed
to &delay in the command-line parsing part of FvwmAuto is NULL-ed. I
can't imagine how and why. But I imagine this is in fvwm.

Unfortunately I haven't enough time to pass fvwm under tests (right
now, when I write this, I'm meantime fighting with a monster FEM
library reconfiguration).

Of course the easiest workaround is to take the FvwmAuto from the
previous version and to use it with 2.0.44. This works seamlessly.

I have to sign off now.

Bye and have a lot of luck. Bonne sant=E9

=09=09=09=09=09Friendly yours, Cristian

Specify the flags after a -- (as per the man page):

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon -- Flat
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap foo.xpm -- Sunk
ButtonStyle 3 Pixmap

I've got a pic of a flat look here:

I wonder if my patch for multiple displays made it into 2.0.44?  Sorry
I haven't had time to download and take a look, but I know I posted a
fix against 2.0.43 that improved focus handling for multiple displays
(at least for me -- I don't use SloppyFocus).   I could dig up the
patch if you can't find it on the archive or via Web search.

You could get rid of your 8bit modes in the Xfree86 config file.

or have ":0 Local local /usr/bin/X11/X -bpp 16" in the xdm/Xservers file.

To do 16bpp with startx do:

startx -- -bpp 16

Hi,

guess, I've found the FvwmAuto bug. 

whoever had trouble with FvwmAuto just doing the first raise with the
timeout, please try the new version and mail me the output.

The others can simply eliminate line #1: #define DEBUG
and use it.

sorry, a bug which only shows on certain OS's - not on mine.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I checked the todo list and FAQ, but I can't seem to find any mention of
how EdgeScroll affects move operations on windows.

Specifically, I have EdgeScroll set to "0 0" because I don't want to
change pages on my desktop when the mouse pointer hits the edge of the
screen (page).

I don't get any scrolls _except_ for when the mouse pointer hits the edge
of the screen when I'm moving a window.

Is this behavior some problem with EdgeScroll, and intended behavior, or
is it possible for the move function to bypass the EdgeScroll
restrictions?

Oops.  Forgot to mention that I'm using fvwm 2.0.43 on SunOs 4.1.4.

In case it's relevant, the way I start the move operation is either
using a menu or mouse-button bound to the Move function (I've been
assuming that was pretty standard):

----------.fvwm2rc

# This one moves and then raises the window if you drag the mouse,
# only raises the window if you click,  or does a RaiseLower if you double
# click
AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "M" Move
+              "M" Raise
+              "C" Raise
+              "D" RaiseLower

# This defines the most common window operations for the desktop
AddToMenu "desktop-window-ops" "Window Ops" Title
+              "Resize" Function Resize-or-Raise
+              "" Nop
+              "(De)Iconify Open (F17)" Iconify
+              "Quit" Close
+              "Destroy" Destroy
+              "" Nop
+              "(Un)Stick" Stick

Hi,
I just downloaded the 1.24r version of fvwm..
I am trying to compile on a SunOs 4.1.4 system.

I am presently running Openwindows 3, when I do 'make all'
the following error come out...

make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 277: Unexpected end of line seen
Current working directory /users/vildosol/misc/fvwm-1.24r/fvwm
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all' 

Any clues???

Thanks...

Folks,

We're attempting to make a jump from fvwm 1.24 to 2.0.44 on a Solaris 2.5
system.  During the compile of 2.0.44, I encountered lib errors resulting
from the fact that the XPM libraries where not present on our system.  I
consulted the fvwm FAQ which pointed me to an ftp server containing the XPM
files.  While compiling XPM, I received this error message at link time:

[stuff snipped]
.
.
.
rm -f libXpm.so.4.7~

*** Error code 1

*** Error code 1

I did attempt to contact the xpm creator with no success.  By the way, we
are running X11R5 with Motif 1.2.3

Any suggestions?

I realize this is the fvwm list (please don't flame me...), but it is related
to fvwm....in a round-about way...

Thanks!

This is indeed a problem with CC=cc. It is also true with some versions of
gcc. I have just upgraded from gcc 2.7.0 which did not have this problem to
2.7.2 which does as well as older gcc 2.6.*. In the gcc case it is not
LD_LIBRARY_PATH that gets set but rather LD_RUN_PATH, but the end result is
the same. Either of thses are supposed to get set to $(USRLIBDIR). In my
case this would be USRLIBDIR = /usr/local/X11R6/lib. Imake of corse thakes
care of this part.

The following command shows the problem with out the fix; 

ldd fvwm/fvwm2
        libXpm.so.4.3 =>   (unknown)
        libXext.so.6.0 =>  (unknown)
        libX11.so.6.0 =>   (unknown)
        libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
        libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
        libdl.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
        libintl.so.1 =>  /usr/lib/libintl.so.1
        libmp.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.1


I looked at the source to xdm and the builds on my various platforms, and
that all use a line like;
 $(CCLINK) -o $@ $(LDOPTIONS).......
with;
 CCLINK = $(CC)
automaticaly by imake for the non trivial case. 

Thus I believe the following patch to Fvwm.tmpl should be in fvwm-2.0.45.
Would the fvwm-workers please try this on their platforms, if they are not
using X11R6.

This is not, I guess.
Make tries to install the man pages to obscure locations, but not to the
one I specified.

cause:
The man pages are installed under MANDIR (see last line of above patch from
Randall S. Winchester)

so _this_ should be changed instead of MANPATH (which is the search path,
with different directories, not the man-page install directory)

I have 'Style "*" NoPPosition' in my .fvwm2rc, and I use
smartplacement with the SmartPlacementIsReallySmart option.

If I start SparcWorks debugger like: "debugger -geometry +88+33 file",
it always ignore the geometry placement request, no matter whether or
not I use the SmartPlacementIsReallySmart flag.

Also, if I remove the NoPPosition style, it always ignores the
position request and places the debugger in position 0,0

Does anyone know why I cannot get the debugger to come up at +88+33?

-Wolf

It is very important that monochrome work properly.  Can you (preferably
everyone, regardless of mono [except Chuck -- please wait until this gets
some testing]) try out the monofix1.diff.gz contained in

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/dist/ .

It does not fix the monochrome restart problem which was in 2.0.43, just
the monochrome related problems in 2.0.44 (I hope).  If you find a
problem, see if it occurs in plain 2.0.44 as well then let me know.

Yep - pretty stupid; my man page didn't update when I did make
install.man, because of the weird way I have man set up. I realized it
would work when I got to the office, and installed .44  on
HP/UX. Thanks.

I can verify that this is a bug caused by running fvwm as the window
manager. I just ran X without a window manager, and my xterm did not
exhibit this bug. Xterms managed by fvwm do show this bug. 

I can't imagine why fvwm would be causing this behavior, though..

I'm running fvwm 2.0.43 on a linux system.

Hi !
I've successfully compiled and installed fvwm-2.0.44 on my AIX 4.1.4 box.
However, I have the foolowing problem:
When I start X11 from the console, I will end up after some seconds with
the usual grey screen, menus are bound to the mousebuttons but no windows 
are opened until I select Restart fvwm from the menu. 
When I switch back to fvwm-2.0.43, the problems are gone.
Any ideas where I could start to locate the source of the problem ?
Thank you
in advance
Axel

Yo!

The day before yesterday I saw a tool for an OS (which shall remain
incognito in order not to arouse the anger of Chuck ;-) which did a
virtual desktop like thingy.  It had something nice: the mini windows
in (the equivalent of) the pager had mini icons in them, so you could
see which desktop was running Netscape and which was running something
else.

Wouldn't that be a nice addition to FvwmPager?

Thank you very much!  The patch works just fine, at least with my
configuration.

There is another monochrome problem, it is probably easier to fix than
this one, but I am _absolutely not_ an X programmer, so I don't know
how to do it myself.  The FvwmButtons module calculates relief colors
from the foregound and background colors to give a 3D effect on the
buttons.  On a monochrome display that color ends up as white (on
white buttons), destroying the 3D effect and making pressed-in buttons
indistinguishable from buttons in the out state.  I have made a small
patch (appended) that makes the relief color black if compiled with
-DBWBUTTONS, but somehow FvwmButtons should detect the monochrome
screen and do it automagically.

PS: Thanks for the good B/W support, more and more programs abandons
us.  I wish Netscape would have the sense not to show black text on
black backgrounds, or white on white :-(

Hi!

I'm having a little trouble getting Fvwm (And mainly FvwmButtons) to
display the .xpm files. I'm sure I'm missing something very important :-)
Ok, when I start X it complains about:

PEX extension module not loaded
XIE extension module not loaded

can that have something to do with it?

My .fvwm2rc looks like this:

ModulePath /usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2
PixmapPath /usr/X11/include/X11/pixmaps  #this is where .xpm files are
IconPath   /usr/X11/include/X11/bitmaps  #other icons

[ .... ]
Style "FvwmButtons" NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, WindowListSkip
Style "FvwmButtons" BorderWidth 5, CirculateSkip, Color black/lightgray
Style "FvwmButtons" Icon toolbox.xpm

[ .... ]

*FvwmButtonsFore black
*FvwmButtonsBack gray85

*FvwmButtons - whatever Swallow "xload" exec xload -nolabel -geometry -1500-1500
*FvwmButtons Xv       xv.xpm                 exec "" xv &
*FvwmButtons Netscape mini.netscape.xpm      exec "" netscape &


Problem is that FvwmButtons never displays any xv.xpm or
mini.netscape.xpm, it just displays "XV" and "Netscape".

Why?

Problem is that FvwmButtons never displays any xv.xpm or

Why?  At first I thought it had something to do with lacking XPM support
in Fvwm so I compiled it again just to see and sure enough "XPM" is
defined so it should have XPM support.

Yeah, this is a problem that I've known about for a while and it
really bugs me, but I haven't been able to figure it out yet.  Note
that it's new to 2.x -> 1.24r doesn't exhibit this behavior, but in
comparing what is happening in the event handlers between the two
versions I don't see any differences that would account for this.

I'm still looking into it though, and would really like to get it
figured out before 2.1.0.  If anyone has any insights into it, please
let me know.

	Hello,

I'm looking for sample .fvwm2rc that includes all the new decor- and other
stuff that came with the new v2.0.44.  It would be cool if there would be 
any "basic" .fvwm2rc's that you could start out with, preferbly with all
new configuration options.

I've tried both
and
*FvwmButtons Title Xv Icon xv.xpm Action exec "" xv &
*FvwmButtons(Title Xv, Icon xv.xpm, Action exec "" xv &)

but it still won't display the icons.

Yes, that would be cool. With my setup, there isn't nearly enough room on
those little windows to have both a mini-icon and the icon name. It already
has a way to disable the window labels (by setting the font to none), so
adding a *FvwmPagerShowMiniIcons option should give the user complete
control. 

I'll add it in tonight, and post a patch. I'll probably center the icon in the
windows.

It's possible that your application ignores the geometry information you
provide it.  Has this worked with any previous version of fvwm or any
other window manager?  I suspect it is the application's fault.  Perhaps
there are some resources you can set to place it where you want it.

Folks,

I have encountered a compile issue on Solaris 2.5 that I have not been able 
to resolve.  I receive this error at link time:

I used "nm" to determined if it (_mcount) was defined, and all appears 
well...

Any suggestions...?

Howdy again all.

Ok, since there were some nasty bugs in 2.0.44, version 2.0.45 is now
ready to replace it, found in the usual spot:

               ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/

It is essentially just a quick bugfix version.  The rather small
ChangeLog entry:

2.0.45
       1. Patches to WindowShade stuff, from Andrew Veliath
       2. Man page corrections & updates
       3. UseStyle fixes from Andrew
       4. CleverPlacement and RandomPlacement fixes from Anthony Martin
       5. Added (De)WindowShade module msgs
       6. FvwmAudio fix (for MINI_ICON & (DE)WINDOWSHADE)
       7. FvwmAuto fixes from Albrecht
       8. DestroyDecor window shrinkage fix, from Andrew
       9. Fix to Wait command lockup (from Makoto Matushita)
       10. Fix to undocumented LEFT_MENUS stuff (from Dan Espen)
       11. Updated FvwmIconMan to Brady's latest, and made it use
           GetFdWidth instead of sysconf for portability (patch from
           Makoto Matushita)
       12. Patch to make CLICKTORAISE define be GlobalOpts
           MouseFocusClickRaises option, from Randal Winchester
       13. Fixes for problems w/ B&W visuals with new
           EXTENED_TITLESTYLE stuff, patch from Andrew
       14. WindowsDesk patch from Pekka Marjola to be able to move
           relative to current desk (now matches Desk builtin, plus
           handles old behavior)
       15. Added decor_examples in sample.fvwmrc dir, which contains a
           few examples of the new Decor/BorderStyle/TitleStyle stuff
           (from lar3ry gensch, Martin Cartwright, Paul Smith)

I would like some more stuff for the decor_examples as well, as people
come up with more.

Chuck

ps - here's gzipped uuencoded patch to go from 2.0.44 to 2.0.45, if
you don't want to download it all.  I won't always do this, but this
one is pretty small, and it might relieve some of the burden on
ftp.hpc.uh.edu.

Well,

When you reference an already installed libfvwm2.a file it isn't using the one you 
just compiled, so if there were any changes to the fvwm library you are going
to be hosed.

My suggestion is not to install the fvwm2 library (you shouldn't need it, unless
you are doing some kind of programming), and if you do, you should be careful
of this bug in the future.

Chuck, I thought this was fixed in the makefile, to make it look for the locally 
compiled library, instead of an installed on.

Mike

Is there a way to change the icon placement.  Right now, When I create a new 
window and iconify, it defaults to the left hand side.  I would like to be able
to set it like an iconbox can be set, but I don't want an iconbox.

Umm...it is:

>> windows.o -O -pipe   -L/usr/openwin/lib ../libs/libfvwm2.a -lXpm
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fully specified path to the local lib.  That isn't the problem here.

The _mcount subroutine has is used with profiling, which means that at
least part of the source was compiled with the profiling support
turned on, but the -p (or -pg) option is not being given to the link
step, so it's not linking in the appropriate libs to do the profiling,
hence the missing function.

Chuck

I can't say for Christopher, but I have that problem with any window I
open.  On 2.0.43, I had it setup for active placement for all cases, but in
upgrading to 2.0.44, this changed to smart placement I believe (it places it
if there is an obvious place, otherwise you place it).  Below is what I have
been using for my default styles, did something change?  (From a reading
through the man page, it doesn't appear so)

Style "*" MWMButtons, MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style "*" ForeColor white, BackColor lightsteelblue3
Style "*" ActivePlacement, NoPPosition 

Or am I doing something wrong?

Never Mind,

The IconBox command on Style is not the same as the FvwmIconBox Module
that also comes with the distribution.  An important semantic
difference.

But now how do I get the icons to stick in the same place once I've
iconified them?  

For example, open 3 windows.  Iconify 2, open the first one and
iconify the third (the one that wasn't originally iconified), it goes
into the slot of the window that was just opened.  

Is there a way for icon placement to be reserved for the life of the
window, regardless of whether or not the window is currently
iconified?

I see LD_RUN_PATH set as well. I always explicitly unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
before any builds -- it seems to always lead to trouble
here. Solaris-2.5, cc-4.0, X11R6.3.

This (use of CCLINK instead of CC) is a nice trick -- do older xmkmf's
generate this CCLINK as well?

Previously I was building with 

    make EXTRA_LDOPTIONS=-R/usr/local/X11R6/lib

which also works (but is more typing).

Thanks.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I'm seeing some odd behavior with the new fvwm that I don't
understand, and which wasn't present in fvwm-2.0.43.

In brief, the title bar buttons that get placed on some of the FrameMaker
(version 5, if it matters) windows appears incorrect.

Normally, I have one button on the left and four buttons on the right
-- lower, minimize, maximize, delete (in left to right
order. The styles section of my .fvwmrc file is appended, in case it helps.

However, starting with fvwm-2.0.44 on some of the FrameMaker5
windows I only get two rightmost buttons -- lower and minimize, while
on others I get all four. It's not a real big deal, but I would like
to have the right-most buttons on all my windows be bound to a
close/delete action.

I've append the output of xwininfo(1) and xprop(1) below for two
FrameMaker windows. The first is one where the anomaly occurs, the
second is one where it behaves as I expect. I notice that in the first
window, `_MOTIF_WM_HINTS' is set. Could that possibly be interacting
with my styles to give the appearance I'm seeing?

Thanks for any help.

I think you are using MWM* stuff (MWMDecor, etc.) and if you do so you
must setup your buttons in an MWM style (such as the standard fvwm2 look).

To clarify, if the application gives MWM hints to not show a Minimize or
Maximize button such the window in question, fvwm2 simply omits either one
or two of the rightmost buttons.  Fvwm2 has done this WAY before 2.0.44
(i.e. it hasn't been touched).  This is why you lose those two rightmost
buttons, leaving only lower and minimize (even though fvwm2 ideally should
have left out minimize and maximize alone).

Since people are having many new button combinations nowdays, it might be
worth it to have fvwm2 listen to button hints and remove buttons according
to binding -- but this could be iffy since you might have it bound to a
custom function, etc.

A possible option would be to have MWMMaximize and MWMMinimize, and
MWMTitleMenu button flags so the user can explicitly set which buttons
denote MWM functions (this would really be the only sure shot way to do
this...).  

I can make a patch if you would like to try something like this.  Come to
think of it, an MWMMaximize flag would nullify the need for the current
MWMButton flag as well.

Hi all!

I don't know if there is a configurable option (.fvwm2rc) for this, 
but one way I just tried is to mark all new icons as ICON_MOVED, since
moved icons seems to stay put. I also wanted the spot where the icon
of a deiconfied window occupie to be to be left alone.

The following patch implements this. I don't know if this is the right
way of doing this but it works for me. Maybe this should be configurable.

I also wanted to have the icon title to raise when given focus so one 
can read the whole iconname without explicit raise of the icon. 
I usually end up with several emacs icons (~20) at the bottom of 
the screen and having the icontitle "pop up" makes it much easier
to find the correct one. 

If it is possible to do all this in the .fvwm2rc file, please let me know.

Sorry for the contextdiff, but the diff at work didn't have -n.

Yes. I forget exactly why I was so fond of these MWM* things, so
I took them out (though I did leave MWMBorder in my Style
"XTerm"). Are these there because some apps don't work (or behave
badly), or is it mostly for appearance.

Anyway, as you predicted, that fixed the problem.

[ clarification elided ]

Thanks, that makes sense now.

Since I asked in the first place, sure I'll test out anything you
want. But I'd also be happy with the status quo.

Thanks.

I guess the title sums it up well. This is a patch to fvwm that makes the 
icons have the shaded look that is typical to NextStep. I acteded without 
shame and took most of the code from AfterStep. As with Afterstep all the 
icons need to have atleast one pixel that is of color "None". I have been 
using this patch agenst fvwm 2.0.43 for 5 months with no problems. My 
goal is to make this yet another style; I.E. shaded icons, but for now it is 
an all or nothing deal. 

If there are any questions or problems please address me and not the 
mantaner(s) of FVWM. They have enough work. 

This patch is posted on my webpage along with a screen shot.

I have just finished writing a patch to FvwmIconBox that does much the 
same as my last patch does; it makes the icons is the box the NextStep 
shaded style. In addition it moves the shading functions into the /libs/ 
area so that other functions and modules can use them. If there is any 
interest to this patch I will post it to my home page. In truth I will 
post it no matter what, but interest will speed up the process.

Second, while looking at FvwmIconBox I observed that it was using a 
structure that was similear to FvwmWindow, and it seems that if I changes 
the structure to that I could move all of the icon code out of 
/fvwm/icon.* and put it into the /lib/ area too, seeing as the code is 
otherwise identical. Just a though. Is seems that FvwmGoodstuff and 
FvwmButtons all use nearly identical code to the fvwm/icon.c code, so why 
have three nearly idencial hunks of code when we can have one piece of 
code. This is good for more than asthetics, becuase linux is sufficently 
smart to share this code (if we make a shared lib that is).

Just my thoughts,
	Ian

Hi,
I'm running fvwm-1.24 and I've got simple (?) problem.  I'm runnning a
1x6 page virtual desktop and I'd like to be able to place items in a
specific page:
+----------+  I'd like to be able to start up my xsession and have an
xterm
| page 0 1 |  (or something... say netscape) on other pages.  I've done
the
+----------+  brute force method and did a geometry offset relative to
the
| page 0 2 |  window height.  Unfortunately, when I move between
platforms
+----------+  (linux, SunOs, Solaris) I have different results.
   ...        
+----------+  Any Suggestions?
| page 0 6 |
+----------+

I'm running 2.0.45 under
   - Ultrix 4.3
   - OSF1 3.2
   - Irix 5.3

and on all three platforms, when I have a call to "Wait" in my
ExitFunction, like so:

DestroyFunc    ExitFunction
AddToFunc      ExitFunction
+      I       KillModule      FvwmButtons
+      I       KillModule      ButtonBar
+      I       Module          FvwmBanner
+      I       Wait            FvwmBanner

when I attempt to restart/quit fvwm, it kills off both FvwmButtons
modules, flashes the banner, then does nothing.  I have to kill fvwm
from the command line.  This (of course) started with 2.0.44.  For the
time being, I've commented out the ExitFunction, but it seems maybe the
fix in 2.0.45 maybe didn't fix it for all cases...?  I attach my
.fvwm2rc below.

If you open some windows and iconify them, clever placement still avoids 
their (non-iconified) positions. This is bothersome, if the whole reason 
they were iconified was the free up space for a new application.

Ideas?

Re: fvwm-45

Not only do I see CleverPlacement avoiding the space once occupied by
iconified windows, but if I open a series of small windows on a
almost-blank screen, I notice CleverPlacement likes to stack them
against the most-right and most-bottom areas of the screen, making
them all look like the classic wind-blown snow in a large pane of
glass view.

Very pretty, but annoying.

I can't duplicate this behavior.  Once I iconify a window, the next window
pops right up in its place as it should.  It seems that for some reason in
your case, the ICONIFIED flag isn't getting set.  Could you or anyone else
who sees this behavior send me your .fvwm2rc file?

Thanks.

Tony.

CleverPlacement places windows so that there is a minimum amount of
overlap, so since you have (or had before iconifying) windows in the upper
left corner of the window, the place with the least amount of overlap is
in the lower right corner.  The real bug is that CleverPlacement doesn't
see that your window is iconified.  It seems that somehow the ICONIFIED
flag isn't getting set.

Again, I can't duplicate this myself, so if anyone who sees this problem
can send me their .fvwm2rc file that would help greatly.  (Hey, this is a
great way to collect some cool .fvwm2rc files :-))

Tony.

fvwm-2.0.45

The man page for fvwm, when describing ``Style windowname options''
lists ``IconTitle/NoIconTitle''.  As indicated in the next paragraph
in the man, this implies that NoIconTitle is the default, which is
wrong.  Hence the listing should be ``NoIconTitle/IconTitle''.  Below
is the trivial context diff.

Thanks for fvwm-2.0.45

OK, I think I found the problem.  You were using FvwmIconBox and the
NoIcon style (although you had this commented out in the .fvwm2rc file
that you sent me, which threw me off for awhile). Whey you "iconify" a
window with this option, it doesn't really get iconified, it just gets
unmapped.  The following patch should fix it.  Let me know if you have any
problems. 

Tony.

Hi there,

using 2.0.44, the following lines in .fvwmrc did what they should:

Mouse 1 T       A       Move-or-RaiseLower
Mouse 1 FS      A       Resize-or-RaiseLower

The "Mouse 1 T" line doesn't seem to take effect in 2.0.45, though --
hitting the left mouse button in the title bar invokes the
Resize-or-RaiseLower function.

Btw, I'm using a Win95 like look, i.e. I have NoInset and
HiddenHandles.  If that makes any difference...

Has anybody else seen this problem?

For what it's worth, on my setup (2.0.45), I can't seem to move my
undecorated transient windows, where with 2.0.43 I can.  btw, the Win95
look almost certainly makes no difference AFAIK... I know some stuff with
regards to moving windows has changed, but don't know what.

The above is true for my Debian GNU/Linux system at home.  Here at
work, I've got a Solaris 2.5 machine.  And it's different: the two
lines work just fine, but the MouseFocusClickRaises option doesn't do
anything.

I wouldn't remove them, but just dim them, like the menu entries (I haven't

why not just have the actual maximize/minimize functions do nothing, if
maximize/minimize is forbidden in the MwmHints and the hints are to be
obeyed.

Unless there is some visible indication that the buttons are disabled, I
think this is absolutely NOT the right thing to do.

If all windows have min/max buttons, but some work and some don't, the
user is just going to be mightily confused and bug reports on this will
pour in to both FVWM development and other software developers forever
more.

yes, right. 
But as andrew said: dimming out a button is a BAD THING, if there's a
popup/menu behind.
And there can be n intermixed levels of popups & complex functions,
so finding the Maximize or Minimize action and dimming these - 
RIGHT THING (TM) - is impossible: O(n!^n!) (well almost).

Okay okay ;-), here is a solution to the problem with MWM button function
hints. What it does is remove the MWMButton button flag, and adds the
following, from the changed man page entries:

...  
These flags are usually used to tell fvwm which buttons should be affected
by MWM function hints. This is not done automatically since you might have
buttons bound to complex functions, for instance.

"MWMDecorMenu" should be assigned to title bar buttons which display a
menu.  The default assignment is the leftmost button.  When a window
with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this button,
it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMin" should be assigned to title bar buttons which minimize
or iconify the window.  The default assignment is the second button
over from the rightmost button.  When a window with the MWMFunctions
Style option requests not to show this button, it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMax" should be assigned to title bar buttons which maximize
the window.  The default assignment is the rightmost button.  When a
window with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this
button, it will be hidden.
...

The default setup is defined automatically for each decor as (this does
not need to be specified):
ButtonStyle 1 - MWMDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMin
ButtonStyle 2 - MWMDecorMax

But, for instance, I had two maximize buttons, 6 and 4, one minimize
button, 2, and a title menu button, 3.  I could specify the following: 

ButtonStyle All - Clear
ButtonStyle 3 - MWMDecorMenu
ButtonStyle 2 - MWMDecorMin
ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax
ButtonStyle 6 - MWMDecorMax

The "Clear" special flag clears any old flags first to be safe.

The patch is named mwmbtnfuncs.diff and is located in:

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1


I saw a post of this a while back, but haven't seen anything recently
to be able to tell if anyone else has this problem.  I like having active
placement of windows (where I tell it where to go, much like the default twm
setup).  In 2.0.40 and I think 2.0.43, I could do this using
ActivePlacement and NoPPosisition.  Since 2.0.44 this seems to be broken,
windows popup in what I think is smart placement (maybe Clever, I'm not
sure what the differences are at the moment).  If an open location exists,
it lands there, otherwise it waits for you to place it.  Can anyone confirm
that ActivePlacement works?  It does this for all applictions I startup
(including terminal windows, message boxes, etc).  My .fvwmrc hasn't changed
styles between the two revs. (and the pertinent portions are attached below)
Any suggestions?  (I haven't tried going through the code yet)

Style "*" ForeColor white, BackColor lightsteelblue3
Style "*"           ActivePlacement, NoPPosition 
Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm
Style "*"           FocusFollowsMouse

(I have this section both at the start of the styles area and at the end of
it)

Here's a suggestion for a future release of fvwm2. Not being a 
particularly great programmer, especially when it comes to X windows, I 
wouldn't know where to start, but here goes anyway -

	When I used to be an avid Acorn RISCOS junkie, when I used to 
write programs for it, dialogue boxes could be sprouted from popup 
windows, to allow for text entries etc. This was very useful, since 
things like formatting disks and stuff could be done without starting new 
applications. 

	It would be nice to be able to do something similar, say using 
FvwmButtons or FvwmForm as the popped-up dialogue box. Moving on from 
that, it would be nice to be able to popup say FvwmButtons, which would 
allow you to use it as an alternative to current menu styles.

I have recently switched to fvwm2.0.43 (on SunOS4.1 and Linux) after
many years of using twm/ctwm and am very happy with the move, thanks
to all fvwm2 developers.

Now for the problem; I have a WinList permanently displayed

*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListGeometry -15+90
*FvwmWinListUseIconNames
*FvwmWinListMaxWidth 110

but as items are added and deleted to it it wanders off in a South

Writting window manager startup files is tedious work, and hard
to do for new users.

Imagine a script (written for a given Linux distribution) that inserts an
``Application'' menu entry for each installed application on a Linux 
system.

For Slackware, the script would compare /var/adm/packages/ contents 
against a list of programs known to behave well when called from a menu
(perhaps even supplying icons for fvwm-95).


Just a thought...

Hi,

I've got a suggestion for the future development, which needs only a small
patch to fvwm and the module interface. I have, in fact, already made
quick (and dirty :-)) patches to the code myself. I hope that this feature
is really new since I have not been able to take a closer look at the
2.0.44 and 2.0.45 releases.
It'll be nice to bind arbitrary commands to mouse buttons which are sent
directly to the modules connected to fvwm to further integrate
them. To realize this, my suggestion is to define a new module message
(which I have called M_MISC_MESSAGE for now) which would contain the
command as an attached string. Most modules would perhaps ignore this
message, others would analyze the string and execute the appropriate
action.
If the suggested functionality was integrated into fvwm-code, modules
could communicate which each other via fvwm by just using its internal
communication facilities. This could be used for instance to write a
common GUI for different modules... 



Stefan.

You need to link with -lnsl and -lsocket, like this:

gcc -fpcc-struct-return -o FvwmCpp FvwmCpp.o -O2      -L/opt/X11R6.3/lib ../../libs/libfvwm.a -L/usr/local/lib -lXpm  -lXext -lX11    -lsocket -lnsl

What version of X are you using?  I'm using X11R6.3 + Solaris 2.5 and
didn't have any compile troubles.

ActivePlacement is still alive and well.  However you need to specify
DumbPlacement as well.  If I remember correctly, this is due to the
default placement styles being changed.  So just change your style
command to be:	 
	Style "*" ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement, NoPPosition

I think you are right. The problem might be that so many new features have
been included into fvwm that it is at times hard to follow the
development for a non-developer.

Anyway thanks for the hint!

This is a direct cut/paste our of the 2.0.45 man page ... I think your
function is already in there.

          SendToModule modulename string
               Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required) to all
               modules matching modulename, which may contain
               wildcards.  This only makes sense if the module is set
               up to understand and deal with these strings though...
               Can be used for module to module communication, or
               implementation of more complex commands in modules.

I have started working on a perl program that will act like a
multi-function module.   I plan to use the SendToModule function to cuase
diffrent things to happen.

Debian linux has such a thing, it's in a package called menu. Every
package that installes an interactive program adds a menu entry for it in
a database, and calls a program that regenerates rc files for different
window managers (And one text - base menu program that I wrote.) The
result is a hierarchical menu of installed programs, quite handy to use.

This doesn't directly answer your question, but coming from ctwm
myself, I'm now a happy user of FvwmIconMan which does (almost)
everything the TWM icon manager does, and more.

FvwmIconMan doesn't wander off for me...

Greetings,

I used to have my icons go to the bottom-left of my desktop when windows
were minimized uner fvwm1.  Now that I've installed fvwm95 (fvwm2) I can
only get a small text-box of the window-title instead of an icon and the
position of that text-box is where the mouse happened to be at that
moment.

Does anyone know how to configure the .fvwm2rc file to get my icons to
behave the way they used to (like icons behave in the Windows 3.1
environment)?

Charlton

In the interest of the truth, FvwmIconMan can occasionally wander as well. In
the next version to be released, I think I've finally got it fixed, but I've
thought that many times before. This is such a major annoyance to me, I have
to vent. I don't know nearly as much about X as there is to know, so if I am
in error, please correct me!

I can't speak for why FvwmWinList is wandering, but it may be for the same
reason as FvwmIconMan. Essentially, you have two programs which can modify a
shared piece of information (the programs being fvwm, and FvwmIconMan, and the
shared information is the (x, y) coordinates of the window). Since X supplies
no synchronization primatives, if either program decides to modify this info in
a nonatmoic fashion, you get a race condition. In this case, if FvwmIconMan is
started with a negative y coordinate (like -0), it tries to grow its window
upwards. There is no atomic X function to do this, so it has to be done in two
steps: 1. read the current (x, y) coords then 2. set the new (x, y) coords. 
Step 1 can either be done implicitely by listening for ConfigureNotify
events, or actively by quering the X server right before doing the
resize. Either way, since there is no "resize upwards function" (as far as I
know), there will be some period of time between those two steps, and if,
during that period, the window gets moved, your window will start wandering. 

The most obvious race condition is if you move the window via fvwm while it's
trying to resize itself. But you also have a problem where the application
moves itself a bunch of times in succession, because then the X server may
process some of these move requests between the time the app "reads" the (x,
y) coords, and when it "writes" it. 

A very sticky problem. In the FvwmIconMan case, one which would be easily
avoided if X provided (and I knew about it) one of the following:

1. semaphores on windows.
2. a XMoveWindow or XMoveResizeWindow function that would do a relative move
   (like move left 10 pixels).
3. a foolproof way to look at a ConfigureNotify event and tell from which 
   client that event originated. 

I'm wary of using XGrabServer, since I've caused some nasty X lockups with
that.

What if one could go to the 'official' FVWM site and access a web form
with click boxes which lets the user chose FVWM configuration options?
There could be small gifs that show what a given feature means. When
finished the .fvwmrc could be mailed back. This works locally also,
and on any platform. Sorry I cant offer to work on this, I am so over
extended with commitments, just wanted to know if someone think its 
either feasible or desirable. Thanks fvwm people.

I'm trying to create a simple form to startup and kill my ppp connection
to my ISP.  But FvwmForm always crashes with an X error: 

| X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
|   Major opcode of failed request:  1 (X_CreateWindow)
|   Value in failed request:  0x0
|   Serial number of failed request:  26
|   Current serial number in output stream:  36

Does this tell you anything?

I invoke FvwmForm from FvwmTalk as: 

	Module FvwmForm Inet

where I have to following in my .fvwm2rc: 

| *InetButton	continue	"Connect"
| *InetCommand	Exec start_ppp
| *InetButton	continue	"Kill PPP"
| *InetCommand	Exec kill_ppp

I get the very same error when I start it up as: 

	Module FvwmForm
   or
	Module FvwmForm Foo

where I have no *FvwmForm???? or *Foo???? entries in my .fvwm2rc file. 

I don't have time just now to upgrade to 2.0.45 -- is there something I
can do to get FvwmForm to work with .43?

This is on Solaris 2.4, running the stock OpenWindows (X11R5). Ideas?

Thanks,

I just upgraded from 2.0.43 to 2.0.45 and I've got a small problem.  I can no
longer see the `outlines' of the windows that come up during placement and
while resizing.

Is there something I may have set wrong in the .rc file?

If someone were to write such a thing, Chuck or I would be glad to put it

Jason,

I should really try the dotfile generator before 
saying the following, but anyway,

1) Generator always in sync with latest fvwm version
2) No need to install a generator program (and tcl/tk)
   Advantage if a bug or shortcoming in the generator.
3) Easy illustration of features, through small gifs
4) Would immediately show fvwm newcomers the richness
   of configuration options, as opposed to NT or Mac,
   and thereby help advertise fvwm and free software.

[good reasons nuked]

So, start writing.  The dotfile generator is there and if it's useful
enough then nobody will ever write your hypothetical web tool.  If instead
there is enough of a need for something else then someone will eventually
write it.  If you want it badly enough, feel free.

This is free software; it is useless to argue _why_ something should be
done because the argument is frivolous without someone who's willing to do
it.  I suppose this works for non-free software, too.

No, not necessarily.  I had the same problem (can't remember which
platform I was on at the time, but I think it was BSD/OS) and I solved
it by using "XORvalue 255" in my .fvwm2rc file.  I just looked at my
Linux box (which I'm on now) and it shows the bands, but I don't have
XORvalue set.  Something happened somewhere, but it hasn't affected
everyone or everything, evidently.

I believe it happened in 2.0.44 initially.

hello, I never tried fvwm on solaris before, but i built it, and it seems to run
in the background okay.
But it does not seem to manage the windows or put borders around them, Am I
doing something wrong,
or am I expecting too much of fvwm to manage a 2 screen sun sparc 5.
 Any advice/examples would be appreciated

Here is a small patch to libs/wild.c to allow nots (!) with wild
cards. I use it to have Next/Prior to skip the Fvwm* windows when
moving focus around. Here is a small excerpt from my .fvwmrc:

Key Prior A M	Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !Fvwm*] FocusAndWarpToWindow
Key Next  A M	Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !Fvwm*] FocusAndWarpToWindow
Key Prior A MC	Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk !Fvwm*] FocusAndWarpToWindow
Key Next  A MC	Prev [!Iconic CurrentDesk !Fvwm*] FocusAndWarpToWindow

The patch is pretty simple. The only difficulity I have with it is the
redefinition of the NoClass and NoResource variables.

Could anybody that have a working .fvwm2rc file that is preprocessed 
using either cpp or gcc (preferrably not m4) using the FvwmCpp (or 
FvwmM4 module) please send me copies of their .fvwm2rc file, and the
command they use to invoke fvwm? I've tried getting that thing working
for a month now, but with no success at all.

I need info on how to do it using fvwm ver. 2.0.33, 2.0.40, 2.0.43 and
2.0.45  (have different versions on different architectures).

I think there was some change made around 2.0.40 on how to use
preprossesing (a change from -Read to -cmd or something like that).

Lotsa thanks in advance!

Hello everybody.

I'm having _big_ problems getting FvwmCpp to preprocess my .fvwm2rc
file using gcc or cpp (I'd rather use gcc, but cpp is OK).

Could anybody that have got this working send me examples on how to do
it? The man pages doesn't offer much help, and searching the web have
so far given no results.

I've been working on this since late november, and still haven't got
it working, so I'm kinda desperate now.

As a last, desperate, solution, I could try to use m4 instead, but I'd
rather use gcc or cpp since I haven't used m4 before.

Lotsa thanks in advance!

You don't need to do anything special to make fvwm work with more than
one screen.

I run fvwm2 like this:

I believe Chuck changed the default value for XORValue.

The reason why some people have this problem is that it will most
likely give you the correct behavior on PseudoColor visuals, while it
will it will probably give you incorrect results on a TrueColor
visual, since for PseudoColor it works on the colormap entries while
for TrueColor it works on the color bits so you need to give it a
pretty high number (I use XORValue 65535, mostly 1s).

If you use M4 preprocessing (and you should! :-) then use this handy macro.
It works for me on our Sun's, some of which have multiple heads, each
at different bits-per-pixel:

# XORValue -- this is the value that bits are XOR'd with when rubberbanding.
# If we have an 8-bit display, use 1, otherwise use 255. The default is '1',
# but it doesn't work well on deeper displays.
m4_ifelse(PLANES,`8',`
XORValue        1',`
XORValue        255')

Since fvwm2 starts a copy of itself for each display (which I think is
terribly wasteful of system resources; other window managers [vtwm, ctwm]
don't do this... and it is not just fvwm which gets spawned twice...
its FvwmAuto, FvwmButtons, FvwmIconMan, etc... yuck.) and parses the
.fvwm2rc for each display, this works great.

Obviously if those XORValues don't work for you (or you don't like them) you
can change them.

While I'm writing:

I *CANNOT* get the Decor-switching pop-up menu to work that lar3ry gensch
submitted (in the "decor_examples" file in fvwm-2.0.45, in sample.fvwmrc).
I tried it yesterday, and if I include a line like

Style "*"	UseDecor Mwm

It works fine. But if I try to use the "decor switching" routines, fvwm
2.0.45 gets totally confused, placing the left, bottom and right handles
all in the upper left hand corner of the border, and completely locking
up the machine if you window shade a window in that state. Doesn't make
me feel to good.

Finally, am I missing something, or is adding buttons to the title bar 
much more difficult in 2.0.45? I used to be able to add a line like
this:

ButtonStyle 6 12 50x10@1 25x35@1 40x35@1 40x60@1 25x60@1 50x85@1 75x60@0 60x60@0 60x35@0 75x35@0 50x10@0 50x10@1

to my .fvwm2rc file and it would appear in the title bar. But now, it is
happily ignored. I've tried resetting the button style, reset button 1 2
and 4, defining buttons 1 2 and 4, adding the 'vector' keyword, adding
'Style "*" Button 6', etc. all to no avail. How do you add a button to the
title bar if that is all you want to do?

Eddy

P.S. FvwmScript (in the 'extras' directory) blows away the FvwmForm module
     in terms of capability (at the expense of requiring an external 'script'
     file instead of being able to include it in your .fvwm2rc file). I have
     been using FvwmScript for about a week now, and have made about 7 or 8
     changes to the source, including upping the maximum number of widgets 
     from 30 to 100 to accomodate some dialog boxes I am working on. The 
     language is a little tedious, but it works great. I really should send
     the changes in to the author so I can distribute my scripts... also, 
     we should consider having the name changed from FvwmScript to FvwmDialog,
     which in my opinion is a much better name. :-)

I just tried this and have the same problem switching, although
shading the window just destroys the window instead.  It doesn't seem
to be related to the decor code (I think; decors just specify what is
drawn around the window, not where to draw them or having anything to
do with events).  My own decors I use work fine; but I must say this
particular example should probably be changed or removed.

I don't think I've ever been able to add a button like this.  I always
had to define a mouse binding to get the button to appear (at least in
my experience).

Yes... TrueColor... setting XORValue worked.  Makes sense now that I know what
its doing.

Hi,
I'am a fan of fvwm95. I read a special note to 'me' and others :-) on 
the fvwm2 web site saying to have a look at ?Decore? parameters etc.
Before I dive into fvwm2 source tree, can someone tell if it's 
possible to have fvwm2 look like 95? Thank you.
Ales

Yes.  There are some sample decors in the distribution of fvwm-2.0.45
that contain a MWM and a Win95 look and feel.

There's an application called tkgoodstuff which can run as an FVWM
module that will produce a nice looking task bar as well.

I have found that XOR must be larger than 255 for my 16 plane display.

# Value to be XORed when creating a rubber band.  This is set by trial
# and error.  Apparently 1 is now the default and 255 was previously.
# 1 is horrible on this machine and 255 is almost as bad.
# 2**16-1 was OK, but intermediate powers of two were better.
XORValue 8191

Hi! I hope this is an ok place to ask -- if not, I apologise in advance.

Are there still any FVWM95 developers out there anywhere? I'd like to
volunteer some time to work on/with the FVWM95 widget set thats shown on
the home page. So if anyone knows who I would talk to about that and how to
contact them, I'd really apperciate knowing that.

Thanks!
Christopher

It is possible, though you cannot really get an exact match.  If you
want to look and act just like Windows 95, it isn't for you (fvwm95
does a better job).  If you are willing to spend time learning how to
configure and play with things, then it might be for you, since you
can then make your own improvements on the look and feel and
incorporate some other new features that fvwm2 has.  There is an
examples file which contains some Win95 type examples from a few
people on this list in the sample rc directory in fvwm 2.0.45.

Since a bunch of people got zapped by this change, perhaps the defaults
ought to be more DWIM?

I would like to have todays day and date displayed in an FvwmButton. I
have tried:

*FvwmButtons(2x1,Swallow "" PipeRead 'date -d today "+%a %b %-d %Y"')

and various pertubations. I'm currently running fvwm-2.0.43 and I'm out of
ideas! Pointers to doc's on PipeRead welcome!

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

Unfortunately, you cannot pass args to a piperead command.
Here is a single word patch, that allow piperead to pass args to the
command it invoques.

I used this patch with fvwm 2.0.??. I hope it works with your version.

If you don't fancy patching anything as Christophe suggested you could 
get hold of xcal. This is a fairly simple calendar program. I don't use 
it for keeping track of appointments or anything (although you can) I just 
swallow the window that displays today's day and date. 

See my fvwm page for an idea of how it looks. There's a screenshot there 
somewhere.

I am running 2.0.45 and find this doesn't work as advertised.

I had been using
*FvwmButtons(2x2, Size 50 50, \
	Swallow(UseOld,NoClose) XClock "Exec xclock -padding 3")


It looks fine on the display but if I do a Researt fvwm2
I have two clock processes (as revealed by ps x).

It appears that after the old clock is released by button-bar, it is
not reacquired.  

If, after say three clocks are listed by ps I close the button bar
without restarting, the swallowed clock is unswallowed as expected but
there is only one clock displayed and winlist shows only one clock
entry (but ps x still shows 3).

I have also tried this with another client, xbuffy, with very similar
results.

Since upgrading the fvwm 2.0.44 and 2.0.45 I've had problems with fvwm
not focusing on the window the mouse pointer is in when I switch
desktops using FvwmPager.  I've not been able to determine the exact
sequence of steps to replicate this yet.

This is what happens:
    1.  Click button1 in FvwmPager window to select a desktop other
        than the current one.
    2.  Move mouse into area of screen where I expect a window on the
        new desktop to be drawn.
    3.  Pager finishes switching desktops, mouse is in a window for an
        xterm, emacs, etc. but that window does NOT have focus.  
    4.  Move mouse out of window and back in in order to get focus set
        properly.

I can't recall ever having the problem with 2.0.44.

At least for me, the Netscape title and icon strings always contain that
"Netscape: " prefix, so no can do.

I'm still pondering the suggestion that FvwmIconMan have different format
strings for different windows (even in the same manager), but that wouldn't
help much here. I really don't feel like integrating sed into FvwmIconMan
though. 

How's about this: Long ago I originally envisioned that you could have the
strings right justified. Since for programs like Netscape (and xterm if you
have the cwd in the title/icon string), the most significant info is on the
right end of the title/icon strings, this seems like a good idea. I'll go
stick that in. 

I'm currently in a major rewrite phase, and am getting near to the point where
I can release something. I'd like to get a release with my major changes out
in enough time to get some bug reports before fvwm2 is officially released, so
this may have to wait a bit.

First of all I would like to apologize for asking twice yesterday. The
computer I sent the mail from panic'ed and died exactly the same
second i sent the first mail, so no fcc was written, and I didn't
think it was sent.

I finally got things working, sort of, but a problem remains:
Here are some rows from my .fvwm2rc file:

#ifdef SMEDJAN
        #define P_NETSCAPE_GEO 814x900+0+1024
        #define P_TALL_GEO 80x69
        #define P_BIG_GEO 163x69
        #define P_CON_GEO 151x5-0-0
...
#elif SNICKERBOA
        #define P_NETSCAPE_GEO 814x900+0+1024
        #define P_TALL_GEO 80x69
        #define P_BIG_GEO 163x69
        #define P_CON_GEO 151x5-0-0
...
#endif
...
AddToMenu Main          "Main Menu"     Title
#ifdef SNICKERBOA
+       "New Terminal"          Exec xterm -bg black -fg white -T Astrid &
#endif
+       "Netscape"              Exec netscape -display $HOSTDISPLAY
-geometry P_NETSCAPE_GEO &

And here's the problem:
the #ifdef SNICKERBOA "New Terminal" #endif thing work fine, but the
Netscape thing doesn't. I get this error:

Warning: Shell widget "netscape.bin" has an invalid geometry
specification: "P_NETSCAPE_GEO" 

But when just putting the .fvwm2rc file through cpp, and redirecting
the output to a file, using the command:
cpp -DSNICKERBOA .fvwm2rc > the_output_file
the_output_file looks like it should, P_NETSCAPE_GEO is replaced with
814x900+0+1024 and everything

Please don't tell me to just use different .fvwm2rc files for
different architectures. I'm doing that now, and it's _very_
frustrating to edit 12 different files when I'd like to add something. 

As always, lotsa thanks in advance!

I found that rubberband (shows when we move or resize a window)
disappears, if the mouse pointer goes to the screen-edge, and it does
not causes scrolling virtual desktop

How to reproduce (minimal sample):

1) Setup fvwm with 'DesktopSize 2x1', 'EdgeScroll 100 0',
   and 'OpaqueMoveSize 0'
2) execute fvwm
3) show window whatever you like
4) do 'Move' built-in function as you like (menu, shortcut, etc)
5) when rubberband shows, move your mouse pointer to the leftmost of
   the screen
6) rubberband disappears
		
Maybe procedures of edge-scrolling or whatever edge management have
some failures, but I don't know where... anyway I'll try later...

Hum, I'am afraid I answered a bit too fast. There were 2 problems ( I think )
If you use, something like
Piperead cat foo
then fvwm executes commands outputed from `cat foo'. ie whatever fvwm commands are
in the foo file. but you cannot get the output for your own !
without my patch, fvwm would just execute cat, not cat foo.

Now, for your button, you need that the piperead command echoes the *fvwmButtons
line.
The following work for me ( with my patch ), I just tried it and will use it for 
now on. Thanks for the idea !


piperead echo '*Fvwmbuttons(Title "'`date "+%a %b %Y"`'", Action Nop)'
or
# cm is the sun Calendar Manager tool
piperead echo '*Fvwmbuttons(Title "'`date "+%a %b %Y"`'", Action `Exec cm` )


Hope this helps,
Christophe

Attached is a patch for the FvwmPager module distributed with Fvwm95 v2.0.43a
(it may also work with the real Fvwm2, which is why I'm also sending this to
both mailing lists).  It adds the option to allow the pager to display a
window's title/mini icon instead of it's name (or instead of nothing).  To
enable it, use:

	*FvwmPagerMiniIcons

Note that if you also have SmallFont set, this will unset it (i.e., you can't
have both the mini icon and the title at the same time).  Also, no attempt is
made to scale the icons--they are centered in the window and clipped where
necessary.

Also in the patch is the ability to change the normal/highlight colors of
the windows.  Use:

	*FvwmPagerWindowColors normalFore normalBack hiFore hiBack

This is useful for picking colors that will make your icons stand out better
than the default window colors set up via the Fvwm DefaultColors resource.  It
also works when having the pager display the window titles.

By the way, all the changes in the patch are line additions, so if it doesn't
fit exactly with the real Fvwm2, it shouldn't be too hard to do the patch by
hand.

Questions/comments welcome.

	Hi, fellows

Thanks a lot, again, to Rob Whapham for the last nifty not only
cosmetic improvement to FvwmPager. And if he did not convince you to
patch the code with his excellent work, look at this little example:
my current buttonbar with a little swallowed pager just seconds AFTER
I applied the patch. In fvwm-2.0.45 I had to do a little handwork
cause patch himself screwed it 5 times from twenty something.

BTW, sorry for the inline graphics, but my page is down these days

				Happy evening,

				Cristian

P.S. Now I need only tooltips on buttons. And hope to find some hours
to DO it.

Hi...
	I was wondering if there was a possibility/patch/option for making
FvwmButtons shaped (like xclock, etc.)? I didn't see anything in the man
pages about this under FvwmButtons, so I was wondering if the option
exhisted. I thought it'd be cool to be able to make the Buttons shaped,
that way, you could have a 95 type configuration and make it appear as
though you had icons on the desktop ... etc... Well... just curious
			-peace

Dear maillist!

I have a problem installing Fvwm under Linux 2.0.0 (slackware).
The problems I encounter go sort of backwards - I'm trying to
install it from scratch and every time the problem appears on
the earlier stage than before.

I had it running about 4 months ago (and I don't recall any
major problems with installation). But then I accidentally destroyed
my other partition (mkswap /dev/hda1 instead of /dev/hda3 does it
pretty quick 8-(   ) and had to reinstall Linux.

Now I'm just stuck. My latest problem with Fvwm 2.0.45 is that
during compilation of all modules make says :

Don't know how to make target ../../libs/libfvwm2.a needed for
FvwmXxxxx.c *** Stop ***

I've looked through FAQs and they say that I really don't need
libfvwm2.a . I tried to change Fvwm.tmpl option
INSTALL_LIB from NO to YES, but it made no difference.
I tried to look into (I)Makefiles for the references to
libfvwm.a but found very few and they seem to be irrelevant.

So can anybody give me advise on what to do please?

Continuing with the problems. Just in case I get through this and
get my previous problem.

It was infamous "PixmapPath module not found" problem.
I read maillist archives but it said the problem was with
2.0.42 Fvwm.tmpl file. My 2.0.43 looked liked correct (patched)
version, but I was still getting this error. 
I concede that I might have xpm installed somewhat incorrectly,
but I think now I have it installed. And the other question
is where this PixmapPath should point and what files are supposed
to be in that directory?

Thank you very much for your attention to such a lengthy message.

Michael.

I think a good thing for someone else to do (since I don't do X :-)
would be to give FvwmPager a 3D look. Something along the same lines
as FvwmButtons would be nice, where the current desktop would be
"pushed in" like a pressed button. The windows on the desktop could
have the same embossed look as the vector menu buttons, and the panels
of each desktop could be delineated with a shallow groove.

Then, if I could convince someone to make a 3D xbuffy (I suppose I
could just build the 3D Athena library) I'd have a fully pseudo-3D
desktop. Right now, FvwmPager looks out of place because it's so flat.

I looked at the FvwmM4 manpage as well as the m4 man page... and I have
never used m4 before in my life. I tried incorporating it into my .fvwm2rc
file and I also called fvwm2 in my .xsession as:

=09fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

as ddescribed... I don't seem to be doing something correctly, either in
my .fvwm2rc or somewhere... I tried using the m4_ifelse thingy for
XORValue just to test... but I keep getting these errors:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module '=7FELF=01=02=01' in Module=

What could I possibly be doing wrong? Is there an example .fvwm2rc
available which properly uses m4? The system I am running on is:

=09SGI, IRIX 5.3, 32 RAM
=09FVWM 2.0.45

Thanx for any help... and sorry for this newbie question :)

I actually prototyped some of these ideas when I was working on my
Python/Fvwm module.  The Pydesks program at one point was actually a
moderately reasonable FvwmPager replacement, and did have some 3Dness
to it.  I ran out of time to hack on it so I ended up stripping all
that stuff out before I released it.

I could dig up the code if anybody is interested.

Try using '-cmd' instead of '-f'.

I spent *days* trying to figure this out under 2.0.43...

Oh, manpage of FvwmM4 is too old... anyway, try

	fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

'-f' option is only for file (like 'fvwm -f .fvwm2rc.modified'), not
for module execution. See manpage of fvwm also (section 'M4 PREPROCESSING').

I'm a BIG fan of FVWM 
 (the Father-of-all Virtual Window Managers - isn't that what the F meant :-)

Here are a few things that I've noticed (bugs ?) using 2.0.45

1. FlipFocus seems to disappear when you Restart your fvwm session (via
   'Restart fvwm2' in the .fvwm2rc file) - this happened on both 2.0.45 &
   2.0.44.  By disappearing I mean I get the following error when I try to
   invoke the function after a restart


        [FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /download/fvwm-2.0.45/modules/ALLmodules FlipFocus


   I've also noticed that FlipFocus goes awry sometimes and when
   asked to FlipFocus it flips between my xterm and FvwmButtons (even 
   though I wasn't focused on FvwmButtons - it ignores the other window 
   that I _was_ focused in).

        Key F1	A       C       Prev [!iconic] FlipFocus

   I've informed Dan Niles (FlipFocus' author) about the Restart problem.


2. I have seen the same problem that Lance Brown (labrown@splat.niehs.nih.gov)
   mentioned in his email about FvwmAuto (not being able to focus); I've been
   at times unable to focus on xterms when I was previously focused in some 
   application window such as Netscape/emacs.  I would have to leave the 
   xterm and enter it a few times before it finally focuses.  I know this is 
   not much of a description, but I can't really place it myself - it seems
   rather random.

   I've also seen a problem with rxvt losing/recapturing focus.  If you 
   overlap your rxvt with any other window - say by 10% and briefly go to 
   the rxvt and return back, you'll notice that the focus keeps shifting 
   from the rxvt to the other window until you move your mouse deeper into
   one window or the other (if you don't move the mouse this shifting stays
   indefinitely).  Since I haven't been able to replicate this problem on 
   two normal xterms (ie. not involving rxvt), I'm assuming this is more a 
   problem with rxvt rather than FvwmAuto

	+       "I" Module      FvwmAuto 200


3. I liked (still do) an old fvwm-1.24 function - 'TogglePage' and would love
   to see it come back.  If it does not, no harm done.  I've been able to
   replicate its behavior by including the following segment in my .fvwm2rc
   file

	AddToMenu MyTogglePage
	+       "ON"                    EdgeScroll 100 100
	+       "OFF"                   EdgeScroll 0 0

   The 'EdgeScroll 0 0' works fine UNLESS you are moving a window in which
   case the scrolling is enabled.  I am not sure if this enabling of scrolling
   upon moving windows is intentional or whether this is a bug (I tend to
   believe its the later).


Lastly, a request; I read the archived version of the emails
(www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/) and it would be much nicer to remove the 
FVWM background/wallpaper (with yellowish tint) from the archived directory 
since it makes it rather difficult to see anything within Netscape.

Many Thanks,

 - Nadim

Hm, I wonder if this is the problem you're talking about:

I click on a menu in netscape (single click, not drag, so the menu stays
up.) Netscape grabs the mouse pointer. I move the mouse over an xterm, of
course, the xterm isn't autofocused, since netscape has grabbed the
pointer. I click on the xterm. This pops down the menu in netscape, and
netscape gives up control of the mouse pointer. But the xterm doesn't get
focused. I have to exit and re-enter the xterm before it recieves the
focus.

It's sort of interesting that if I hit escape instead of clicking on the
xterm to get rid of netscape's menu, the xterm immediatly recieves the
focus.
