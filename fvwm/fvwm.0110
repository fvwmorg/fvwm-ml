HI


When I use the following binding


Key j A M Next (CurrentPage) Focus


and press alt-j several times, the circulating
stops and I have to use a different key mapped
to 'Prev' to cycle back in the list of windows.
Is it possible to let 'Next' go to the begin of 
the list of windows when it reaches the end?
(btw I use fvwm2.4.0)

best regards

jos

Circulation stops because you hit a window that won't accept
focus.  The best solution is to upgrade to a release after 2.4.1
and do this:

 Key j A M Next (AcceptsFocus CurrentPage) Focus

If you don't want to upgrade, try:

 Key j A M Next (CurrentPage !Iconic) Focus

	Probably not many. I certainly haven't met any of the others face to

This isn't an fvwm issue, but

  xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

in your ~/.xinitrc should do the trick.

This depends on how you set FvwmButtons' background.  If you used

  FvwmButtonsBack ...

you can use the "Back" options in your button.  But if you have

  FvwmButtonsColorset ...

in your config file, the button background must be changed with
the colorset option:

  *MyBar3(4x2+8+6, Colorset <n>, ...)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

If that does not help you, please post your configuration lines.

I don't think there is an option to control this.

A small box should appear next to the label when the window is
iconified.

You're probably not happy with the new hilight colour
calculations.  In 2.4.x, there are several ways to control this.
First, if you simply want a flat, non-3d look, you should use
'flat' instead of 'up' or 'down' in your config.  Second, hilight
and shadow colours can be controlled with colour sets (try
"man FvwmTheme" for details).

This line beongs after the config lines for FvwmIconMan or in your
InitFunc/RestartFunc.

It does not make sense to first specify 'up' looks and the
override them with 'down'.

Because our cats are far more important than we are? ^_^  ^_^  ;-)
Since I'm very carmera-shy there are only a few pictures of me
from the last ten years.  Once the home page of my company goes
online (which should happen "any day") you can find a tiny picture
of me on the main page (www.lifebits.de).

Not me.  I don't even know exactly where most of the others live.

In 2.4.x you can tell fvwm to ignore the num-lock modifier
completely with the IgnoreModifiers command:

  IgnoreModifiers L2

(num-lock is usually modifier 2 in XFree.  If that's not the case
for your X server, use the "xmodmap" command to find out the
correct number).  This command causes to bind all combinations of
num-lock and caps-lock for each binding.  E.g., if you have

  Key 1 A M GotoPage 0 0

fvwm also binds

  Key 1 A ML GotoPage 0 0
  Key 1 A M2 GotoPage 0 0
  Key 1 A ML2 GotoPage 0 0

(actually, bindings don't know about the 'L' modifier, so this
exaple is not accurate, but you get the idea).  This can create a
lot of extra netwoirk traffic and slow down things considerably,
especially if you ignore other modifiers too.

There is no full version history on the home page.
Does this mean no one knows exactly what happend before 2.1.x (I think it
says "2.0.0 Beginning of time" or something like that)
It would be cool to know when these versions came (although not the most
useful thing on earth).
Also, what was the main inspirations for FVWM (look and feel), I know it
is (was?) based on twm code.

Almost every mail I send has a picture of me.

OK, I lie, that picture is 20 years old.

None.

Lately I've been telecommuting 3 days a week.  Its getting
so I don't even meet the people I work with on my job face to face.

2.0.0 is the beginning of fvwm2.
For history before that you'd have to look at fvwm (version 1).
I have fvwm 1.24r and its ChangeLog goes back to "0.96".

I wasn't around for the very beginning of fvwm1, but it seems to
me that Rob was shooting for the 3d appearance of Mwm.
Around 0.98 I see the first reference to mwm and 3d was prominently
mentioned in the README.

Is there any chance.. or... how difficult would it be to turn the pager
into a Gnome Applet?

Hi!

I noted the "Key" command became case sensitive when I moved from 2.4.0 to
2.4.2

I had: Key R	A	M	Popup RootMenu

This stopped working
Instead: Key r	A	M	Popup RootMenu
made it work again as expected.
This could possibly be a problem for some users (I'm thinking about point
0 in the FAQ: "My keyboard/mouse stopped working")
Just a thought.

This is fixed in the next release (although case insensitivity was
a bug in the first place it's hard to explain that to the users).

As I said, when the web page goes online...  The exact date is
a bit vague, though.  Depends on how fast our student does the
work.

hi: The fvwm homepage has screenshots of themes by An
Thi-Nguyen L (http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/). I
tried getting his configuration files but have not
been able to get them.
(http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/ at the bottom
under links) I am wondering if someone could help in
regard to getting the files. I hope to get some help
from one of the users or the author himself. 

TIA 

avinash

Good. I see it in fvwm-2.4.0. I had not noticed it in fvwm2-2.2.4.
And, for curiosity, is it a way to turn this fonction off ?

Somehow, my mouse cursor in fvwm2 has become BOLD.  I can't figure out how to
change it back to normal thickness.  [It's been sometime since I last used/loved
fvwm.]  I'd really appreciate it if someone could provide a tip on how to do
this, or a ref to the appropriate URL.  I have looked at the main fvwm2 main
page and can't quite figure it out.  Please CC a reply to ricst@usa.net.  Many
thanks!

I looked at the code and it doesn't seem to be possible to turn
off the boxes.  It looks as if mini icons are drawn over the box
if they are used, but I didn't try that.

What exactly does 'bold' mean here?  Is the pointer brighter, or
bigger or thicker?  And what exactly does "Somehow ... has become
bold" mean?  Did you change something with your X server?

Anyway, you may be able to fix your problem with fvwm's
CursorStyle command.

HI!!

Is it possible with fvwm2 to give icons normal window
decorations (a border) and a fixed size (where the 
icon image is then placed in the center of the icon
window), like in Motif mwm?

best regards

jos

Not without source code changes, or using uniform icons.

Oh my... I would love that so much. That's the ONLY thing
I like in other wm like WindowMaker. I hate those floating
icons of different sizes and shape swimming on my desktop.

And I'd like them to have a common pixmap in the background,
that could be different based on a rule, i.e. all terminal
icons would have a blue pixmap behind, all netscape icons
would have a red one, etc.

Unfortunately I asked that a while ago and the answer at that
time was that "the current behavior is a wanted feature" or
something...

I'm interested in the developer's answer on that again ;-)

IconBox and IconGrid can reduce the chaos to some extent.
I suppose creative use of xsetroot (or some such) could
arrange for a different background in the areas that will
be used by IconBox than in the rest of the desktop.

Strange however that I don't see these boxes using fvwm2-2.2.4 with the
same config file...

Sorry to disturb but I have just a little question.

For my Job I consider switching from motif to fvwm .

But the main problem is that muy boss would like to 
have the titlebar text left justified. 

Is it possible with fvwm ? and How ( Fvwmrc ?) ?

I have looked in the man page on www.fvwm.org but 
I found nothing about this feature.

Thanks.

Yes, with 

  TitleStyle LeftJustified

(you may have to use 'AddTitleStyle' if you have other TitleStyle
lines in the config file).

Using "OpaqueMoveSize 100" doesn't make all windows move opaque as staed
in the man page. Windows whos area is larger than the screen is still
moved outlined (which seems logical, since it says 100%).
Maybe there should be "OpaqueMoveSize infinit" or something like that.
Alternativly make "OpaqueMoveSize 100" a special case (might be considered
ugly).

I'm not real clear on exactly what question to ask or how to ask it (shor=

These questions probable can't be answered here, but I didn't get a respo=

1) What do I have to do to the windows keys so that FVWM will recognize t=

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

   I'm not real clear on exactly what question to ask or how to ask it (short
version), so here's the long version:
   I have a keyboard, don't see a brand name, model SK-6000 (made in China), that
has the Windows keys on it and one other key I've never seen before (upper right
hand corner, larger than the others, has a diamond shape arrow on it pointing
left).
   The windows keys kick out a keycode (125 - 127 on showkey, 115-117 on xev),
but the "diamond" key in the upper right hand doesn't.  xev and showkey -k don't
even register that it's been pressed.  showkey -m returns on keyevent: 

àhàè ( 0xe0 0x68 0xe0 0xe8 )

Running Red Hat Linux 7.0
1) What do I have to do to Red Hat so that the diamond key kicks out a keycode
and/or is usable/recognizable by the system?

2) I created my own file with keycode settings for the windows keys:

plain keycode 125 = F125
plain keycode 126 = F126
plain keycode 127 = F127
string F125 = "Win_L"
string F126 = "Win_R"
string F127 = "Menu"

They show in dumpkey, but only work from the console mode.  When I exit X and
press one of them, the key registers.  And it also shows in Emacs.  But when I
start X and try it, nothing registers, nor do they show in xev.  Does the X
window system have its own keycode bindings?  If so, where do I find them?  If
not, how do I fix this so that X based programs will recognize keyevents from
these keys?

For the key that has a scancode, use xmodmap to assign the
scancode to a keysym, then you are in business.

Don't know.

This is for RH 7.1 (shouldn't be so different)

Edit the file: /etc/X11/XF86Config
Mine contains these lines a bit down:

    XkbModel    "pc105"=09
    Xkbkeycodes "xfree86"
    XkbLayout   "us"
    XkbTypes    "default"
    XkbCompat   "default"
    XkbSymbols  "en_US(pc105)"
    XkbGeometry "pc"

But make sure you make a backup of the file first....

To view differnt keboards available run "xkeycaps".

Then restart your X server. Switch virtual console to a text console
(Ctrl-Alt-1) log in as root at the text login prompt.
Then run the command "init 3"
Now the system goes down to runlevel 3 and the X server quits.
When this has happend (press enter a couple of times to get back the
prompt if it doesn't show up in a short moment)
Now run "init 5".
Now the system goes to runlevel 5 and the X server restarts.
To get back to X switch to virtual console 7 (ctrl-alt-7).

Is it possible to make "tear-off" menus as in mwm?
So that you can open a menu in a way so that it stays open even after
having selected an item...

Try xkeymaps, it let you change the value of a key. You may assign the
value Meta for the windoze key. I don't understand the other key, it
is Alt, or AltGr, or menu, or maybe diamond key...

The icon in FVWM is drawn with a 3d border a-la motif if the pixmap is
not transparent (i.e. has no color "None"). You can't specify a spacing.

Then you may use wm-icons - themable distribution that currently includes
17 one-sized icon sets, each set implements the list of 84 names.

Yes, but then it's not possible to use applicattion supplied icocs, you
will have to override all icons.

I also would like to have the possibility to get Mwm/CDE like icon frames
(with configurable backgrounf colour used in conjunction with
transperancy)...

Thanks to this list and the Red Hat list, I've been able to set up the Windows
keys on my keyboard as modifiers.  This is what I did:

               Add the following to ~/fvwm/.fvwm2rc

(These next lines modify the keys so that they're defined as modifiers. Note - I
had to use Super_L and Hyper_L as the modifiers because Super_R and Hyper_R when
added to Mod4 also added themselves to Mod3. Setting it this way allows me to
use the left window key and the right window key as separate modifiers)

To create shortcut keys with the above, I used the following:

# "3" stands for mod3 "4" for mod4 (xmodmap)

Key F2    A     3      gotoDesk 0 1

               Notes

To get the above to work with this keyboard (having the left and right windows
keys act as separate modifiers) I had to set this keyboard in
/etc/X11/XF86Config to a pc101 keyboard.  Setting it to pc105 or microsoft (to
get the windows keys to automatically work) did work, but the windows keys
defaulted to the same modifier, meaning that I couldn't set them up as separate
modifiers.  Setting the keyboard to pc101 so that these keys weren't
automatically recognized allowed me to individually define them.

               Syntax

Here is my output from xmodmap:

$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3        Super_L (0x73)
mod4        Hyper_L (0x74)
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

To get Fvwm2 to recognize mod3 and mod4, I had to use the following syntax:

Key KP_Begin    A     3      All (MyBar3) Iconify

The "3" stands for Mod3.  I tried M3, m3, Mod3, and mod3, but only "3" was
recognized.  To use two modifiers I had to set it up as:

Key KP_Begin    A     M/3      All (MyBar3) Iconify

The above works if you hold down the left window key and left alt key
simultaneously while pressing the number 5 on the keypad.  If you remove the "/"
it won't work (been there, done that).

I'm using fvwm-2.4.0-2 on a Red Hat 7.0 system.

You could make also the PC104 or PC105 works by inserting a new line
+  "I" Exec exec xmodmap -e "clear Mod3" -e "clear Mod4"
before the add, or in just one line:

+  "I" Exec exec xmodmap -e "keycode 0x73 = Super_L" -e "keycode 0x74 = Hyper_L" -e "keycode 0x75 = Menu" -e "clear Mod3" -e "clear Mod4" -e "add Mod3 = Super_L" -e "add Mod4 = Hyper_L"

hi,

i keep having problems with configuring keybindings in fvwm-2.4.0
running on netbsd 1.5.2/i386.

my idea was to use the windows-keys on my keyboard to control xmms. i
already defined these 3 keys as F13-15 with xmodmap, but fvwm doesn't
seem to care. it doesn't even work with other keys, no matter which
context or modifiers i use. 

my .fvwm2rc is attached.

thanks in advance,
philipp

hi,

i keep having problems with configuring keybindings in fvwm-2.4.0
running on netbsd 1.5.2/i386.

my idea was to use the windows-keys on my keyboard to control xmms. i
already defined these 3 keys as F13-15 with xmodmap, but fvwm doesn't
seem to care. it doesn't even work with other keys, no matter which
context or modifiers i use. 

my .fvwm2rc is attached.

thanks in advance,
philipp

hi,

i keep having problems with configuring keybindings in fvwm-2.4.0
running on netbsd 1.5.2/i386.

my idea was to use the windows-keys on my keyboard to control xmms. i
already defined these 3 keys as F13-15 with xmodmap, but fvwm doesn't
seem to care. it doesn't even work with other keys, no matter which
context or modifiers i use. 

my .fvwm2rc is attached.

thanks in advance,
philipp

Ionel,

I tried that, and it worked in that it removed the listing from xmodmap. =
 But
Xemacs continued to kick out rather rude error messages about improper ke=
y
bindings.  The only way I could keep it happy was to go with the current =
setup;
a pc101 keyboard, and then add in the other keys.

The impression I was left with is that with a pc105 or microsoft keyboard=
,
Xemacs binds Super_R and Hyper_R to mod3 even if they aren't explicitely =
put
there by xmodmap.

Glen

I had this line in .fvwm2rc in 2.3.x:

TitleStyle HGradient 100 4 rgb:60/40/ff 33 rgb:ff/ff/99 34 rgb:ff/ff/99 33 rgb:ff/00/ff

I just upgraded to 2.4.2, and it no longer works.  I tried adding it to
FvwmTheme:

*FvwmTheme: Colorset 2 HGradient 100 4 rgb:60/40/ff 33 rgb:ff/ff/99 34 rgb:ff/ff/99 33 rgb:ff/00/ff
*Style * Colorset 2

But that didn't work.

Suggestions?

Glen

OK, then. I don't know what configurations you have for emacs
and I am not a emacs user myself.

I'm trying to modify window styles so I can have a different title bar style,
mainly different color gradients, for 3 or 4 programs I use frequently.  Each
program will have it's own unique title bar coloring.  I've found I can do this
with AddToDecor.  However, it seems I have to define everything with scratch
with each decor.

What I need is one decor template that contains the default definitions for
ButtonStyle only, and then an additional decor defined for each window style
that I can combine with the default decor.  For example:

AddToDecor Emacs
 + IncludeDecor Default
 + TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 128 3 rgb:60/40/ff 33 rgb:ff/ff/99 34 rgb:ff/ff/99 33 rgb:ff/00/ff
<etc>

Something along those lines.  But I haven't found a way to include the Default
decor's settings in those for Emacs.

Suggestions?

Glen

How do I change the TitleBar font color on an inactive window, and on an active
one?  It seems that inactive defaults to white while active defaults to black.

This seems odd, about the only thing emacs is supposed to do with those
modifiers is making sure that a Meta key is present. But maybe Xemacs
does more fiddling with the keyboard (I'd surely hate that), can't tell cause
I use GNU emacs.

My guess is that you just picked the wrong pc105 keyboard. I think there
are quite a few that you could try with xkeycaps.

I'd also simply set my keyboard properly in my .xsession (or .xinitrc) file,
e.g. with something like

# try to adjust keyboard
if [ -f ~/.xmodmap-`hostname` ]
then
    /usr/bin/X11/xmodmap ~/.xmodmap-`hostname` &
fi


The .xmodmap-... file is generated with the help of xkeycaps and then modified
a bit (especially the modifiers).

Cheers

Klaus

In 2.4.x, you can use $[vp.width] and $[vp.height] to get the
screen's (viewport's) dimensions.

HI!

ok, if you think it's not too difficult, I'll try.
I had a short look at icons.c already, but it does look 
complicated. First, I have to get a better idea how 
everything works. I hope I can get back to you with 
questions later.

best regards

jos

I hate double-clicking to deiconify, so I tried to set single click to
do this:

Mouse 0 1 A Iconify

On my Debian Linux boxes this seems to work just fine. Downloading the
latest fvwm2 release and compiling it on a DEC workstation under Digital
UNIX V4.0E I find a different behaviour: single click deiconifies, but
only when the cursor is moved after the click. The click does not seem
to register until the mouse moves. I have tried playing with ClickTime
and Double ClickTime, but to no avail, you can wait forever and the icon
just stays iconified. 

I'd be very grateful if someone could tell me what I am doing wrong. I
didn't find a solution in the FAQ.

Thanks.

Yes but David is trying to get iconify to work
from button 1 (leftmost) on the window using any mouse button.

The "Mouse 0" binding works for me using Solaris and Exceed.

I suspect a problem with the DEC Workstation X server.

If you bring up xev and press the mouse button, do you see
a press reported?

If you then release the button do you see a release reported?

If just click the way you normally do, do you see a press and
a release?

That command says:

Mouse button 1, on an Icon, with no modifier key held in, does Iconify.

Keep "cc"ing the fvwm list.  Believe me, you want them to
check up on me. :)

I'd say your result points directly at a problem with your
X server.  You should not need to move the mouse for the server
to generate a button press event.

I'm not familiar with DEC's server, but I'd try the
server man page "man X".

Then I'd look for something that controls the way the mouse
works, possibly "man xset".

I don't know, it could be a broken mouse.

Hi, I'd like to install fvwm 2.4.3 on my school account, which is
limited to 12 MB.  At school we still have 2.0.45(!), which makes it
hard to exploit nice new features at home and then go to school and
use the same but different window manager!

Fortunately, I'm something of a minimalist as far as desktop clutter
goes, so all I really care about is something like bin/fvwm2,
bin/FvwmCommand, modules/FvwmPager, man/man1/fvwm2,
man/man1/FvwmCommand, man/man1/FvwmPager.  I have no problems
compiling because I can just do that in /tmp, but is it naive to
simply copy those 6 files into ~/fvwm or something and proceed merrily
on my way, or will I have strange and unexpected problems.  What would
be a clean way of firing this up?

Thanks,


cyp

Just copying those files will give you a problem.

configuring with --prefix
and doing make install
will accomplish what you want.

If you are really tight on space, you could remove the modules
you don't want and their man pages after you are done.

One difference between 2.0.45 and 2.4.3 is that some stuff is
installed in <prefix>/share/...

Is there a way to mathmatically modify these values from within .fvwm2rc?  If I
use $[vp.width], the bar extends app 12p beyond the viewing range of my screen.
I tried 

*MyBar2Geometry $[vp.width]-12x115+0-0
and
*MyBar2Geometry $[vp.width-12]x115+0-0

but neither worked, instead moving the bar to the top of the screen (it's
supposed to be on the bottom).

Use PipeRead to do arithmetic:

PipeRead 'echo "*MyBar2Geometry `expr $[vp.width] - 12`x115+0-0"'

(Warning, lightly tested.)

This works for me.

+	I Resize br w-10p w-27p  # account for borders and title


So maybe you can use window arithmetic...

create a window of size $[vp.width]
resize the window by 12
pass that new w as a param back to your MyBar2Geometry

ok, so i'm being silly

Dan,

The line works.  However, on experimenting with it after using Ctrl-Alt-KP_Plus,
the variables $[vp.width] and $[vp.height] aren't changing to be current with
the new window size.  No matter what screen resolution I was at, the values
always showed 1152 and 864 respectively.

I have my screen resolution settings in /etc/X11/XF86Config reading:

	Modes		"1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600"

I experimented with it by changing the line to :

	Modes		"1024x768" "1152x864" "800x600"

so when I started X it would start out at 1024x768. But $[vp.width] and
$[vp.height]  still read as 1152 and 864.  The only way I could get them to read
the correct value was to change the "Modes" line to:

	Modes		"1024x768"

When it only had one value, $[vp.width] and $[vp.height] read the current window
settings.  When I have multiple values in for it the largest settings are used,
regardless of what the actual values are.

The draw back to this is that I have to modify XF86Config every time I want to
change screen resolutions.  The good part is that I don't have to reset the
values in .fvwm2rc.

Is there another way to read current screen size settings through Piperead?  I'm
not a computer expert.  I don't know what system wide variables might hold the
current screen parameters.

Glen

I believe that someone earlier had asked how to bind the Windows Menu key to
Fvwm's RootMenu.  I just set that up on my system, and this is what I did:

Add the following to both the 
AddToFunc InitFunction and AddToFunc RestartFunction

+                         "I" Exec exec xmodmap -e 'keycode 117 = Menu'

Then add in the following line with the section where you place your key bindings:

Key Menu         A       N       Menu RootMenu Nop

That should do it.  When you press the Menu button on your keyboard the root
menu will pop up under your mouse cursor.

Dan,

As a follow up to this letter, I checked xrdb.  The window values for width and
height are also showing the largest screen resolution listed in XF86Config
regardless of what the actual settings are:

$ xrdb -symbols

-DWIDTH=1152

To avoid duplication, you may instead add this once to StartFunction.
In fact, in most of configurations all duplicated lines may be removed
from InitFunction, and RestartFunction may be renamed to StartFunction.

This will not work for the first time FVWM is started, because Key command
is executed before xmodmap.

xmodmap and xset belong to X not FVWM, so it is best to put these commands
to .xinitrc (without exec). This guarantees that all changes to X are done
before FVWM is even started.

Another solution to this Menu key problem is, like it was suggested, to
specify the correct keyboard in X configuration, so Menu is mapped by X.

Mikhael.

I'm far from an expert on XFree but I don't believe it provides an API
to get  the  current visible  area   when you  use  KP_plus  to change
resolution.  As far as X and Fvwm are concerned, you still have a full
size screen.

This color is controlled by Style options ForeColor or Colorset,
and HilightFore or HilightColorset.

Note that if you use decors, I can understand your problems, you can't
change this color per-decor, you should change it per-style.

Mikhael.

You can take a look at UseDecor and UseStyle in the man page, but this
probably does not solve your specific problem.

You can't inherit decors and there is no something like CopyDecor command.
But you may simulate this operation using your function, see:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0011/msg00306.html

Decors do not get along very well with styles. The future of decors
(whether they should be dropped in favor of styles) is still not decided.

Mikhael.

HI!

I'm looking at how to give icons normal 
window decorations. I think I understand some
of the code, but I don't see directly if it
is possible to use the drawing code for windows
(DrawDecorations function) to also draw the
icon borders, as the icon window is a part of 
the FvwmWindow object (if I am correct). Is it
possible to make some kind of a cast and still
insert the icon window into this function, or 
should I just copy out the drawing code and make
a new function especially for icons?

best regards

jos

Mikhael,

This must not be what you mean, because it isn't working:

TitleStyle Inactive ForeColor black

Nor does this:

Style "TitleBar" Inactive ForeColor black

The correct syntax is:

  Style * ForeColor darkred, HilightFore darkgreen

Cool.  FVWM is definitely the best window manager.  Some may work better out of
the box - the Windows style of window manager where it does all the thinking for
you and all you do is click and point.  But FVWM lets us do it our way.  

A friend of mine emailed me a couple of weeks back.  He's using Gnome.  He was
really irritated because every time he accidentally clicked on the upper left
hand corner of the window it closed it.  Not sure why he's clicking up there,
move or resize maybe, but I told him that he won't have that problem with
FVWM. You can configure the corners, buttons, etc., any way you want.  FVWM is
the best!

i like programs to do exactly what i like them to do, no
matter if i have to spend 2 days configuring them, and i
dont have a pretty gui, which makes me coffee, at the same
time as it is trying to figure out what it is i would like
to do.... (which is why i also like vim, mutt, slrn :)

also, i am not sure if this observation has any basis, but
somehow fvwm always seemed to be much faster then
enlightenment, sawfish, kde, and the likes.

i am sure, there are probably other small wm's out there,
but I just like fvwm way too much to even try them (and now 
that it stops annoying transient windows from popping up in
the 0,0 corner, i am in love....)

so, the thing that always bothered me is why people started
new wm projects, as opposed to helping out with existing
ones, like fvwm? i mean, i saw some "small, configurable,
theme-able" wm's out there, but that's exactly what FVWM
is... i wonder if that's because "they can do it better?"
attitude seems to be pretty common in open source (and not
open source) ? ... just seems so much more could've been
accomplished if people who have the time to contribute used
that time to enhance things that are there ... 

but i digress

Yes! I could write a 10-page rant about arrogant applications that
think they're smarter than the user.

One of the things I love about fvwm is the single, hand-tweakable configuration
file, and the fact that fvwm doesn't write over it unless you darned well tell
it to. I'm fed up with config files that take up whole directory trees, get
written out every time you quit whether you changed the config or not, and/or
have threatening headers like "<automatically generated, do not edit!>"
Blegh. Why don't you use a proprietary binary format, while you're at it?

The worst offender I can recall is an app called FancyLauncher that I tried
briefly. It writes out its config every time it exits, whether you've changed
anything or not--and even if you're right in the middle of editing the
config file. Now, it lets you specify relative offsets for button locations,
so that you can easily, say, insert new buttons in the middle without changing
the location data for the rest. But when it writes its config out upon
exiting, it *always* writes out absolute button locations! So much for that
useful feature...

Well, count me in as someone who's trying to help out with fvwm :-) I've
created a patch to make titlebars more themable, but right now it's heavily in
development and I've only been posting it on fvwm-workers. For a preview of
its abilities, check out the screenshots at http://www.igs.net/~tril/fvwm/.

I think one of the problems with fvwm is that it is vastly underrated.
Few people seem to know how beautiful it can be, as well as functional.

That's the point. The coffee they do is generally not so good !

There's no doubt that Fvwm can do exactly what you want it to do
and I recommend it to my friends :))
However, there is a bad point that I would like to point out:
it misses a general documentation towards the end user 
that would introduce the more specific documentation.
Something which could be read in an evening (5 or 6 pages)
explaining the philosophy and the 
organisation of fvwm (its links with X, its organisation
in Modules, a synthetic presentation of the various modules,
the way the windows are configured using styles...). 
At the moment,
the documentation supposes the user know all these things and 
the first step is a bit high. A short presentation should be 
sufficient to get a working configuration and to be ready 
to read the more specific documention. A possible plan 
would be
-what is a window manager 
-why should I choose or not choose fvwm
-the general organisation of fvwm:
	-its links with X
	-what do fvwm without any module
	-the modules
	-the styles
-commented examples of configurations

Concerning the philosophy, I also think it should be explained
on the web page. 
When I decided to choose a wm a few months ago, it was not very
clear if fvwm was the one I was looking for. 
If you 
-want something light and fast
-want the wm to do exactly what YOU want 
-want a perennial organisation of your desktop
-like efficient keyboard or mouse shorcuts
-are ready to spend some time configuring

then fvwm is done for you ;-))))))

But if you

-feel nervous if you need to write 5 lines of code
-want all the possible features installed at the same
time (including coffee !), no matter if your computer becomes slow 
-leave someone else organize the desktop for you, 
no matter if its next idea will be different
-think that everything on a computer can be done with a mouse

then you should choose another wm. 

Hope these comments will help...
Laurent.

I recommended the voting site to an other mailing list and
I start to get e-mails which complained about the fact that
fvwm (and others from wm family) are toghether with kde and gnome,
which supposely are not window managers, but desktops. Can someone
help me to understand why kde and gnome are not simply window managers?
For me kde and gnome are just slow and imposible to configure.
This is the definition of desktops?


Thank you,

Ionel

I just voted myself.  Fvwm is in 4th place behind WindowMaker, IceWM
and AfterStep.  Not sure why Fvwm isn't first.  I have to agree with
all the pro Fvwm comments I've seen so far.  I won't work on a
computer until I have it up and running.  I haven't gotten around to
running it over Exceed on my Windoze box, but then again, I haven't
even turned the stupid thing on in weeks :)

I have spent a lot of time learning the 'pick your own bells and
whistles' apps, like vim and mutt (I keep threatening to learn slrn,
but I found a mutt patch to read news instead).  Because of this, I
have learned to coexist pretty well in a Windoze bootcamp - so long as
I only have to *read* the Wincrap, not put it out :)

Now that I have my Fvwm config tweaked, I hardly ever touch it.  Even
when upgrading, I often just put the tried and true config in place
and it's like magic.  Everything works.  The only thing I have to
fiddle with regularly is the menus.

And fast?  Forget it!  It's the fastest thing I've seen on a computer!
(especially now that I'm on FreeBSD :)

And just try to restart you MS window manager without dumping EVERY
app running into the crapper!  I'm always tweaking my menu then
restarting the wm so I don't have to think about it.  It's just there.

HI

when I issue the command shown in the 'subject'
several times, the desk also changes to a lower
one when 0 is reached. Is this a feature or a bug?

I'm using fvwm 2.4.2

best regards

Please describe better the problem. Do you speak about FvwmPager?
The command "GotoDesk -1 0 10000" (not GotoDesktop) works as expected
for me, i.e. does a circulation through desks 2, 1, 0, 10000, 9999,..

Well, after this command, my GNOME pager (Desk Guide) crashed, it can't
work with desk numbers greater than 40, but this is not related.

Regards,
Mikhael.

oh, it circulates! I understand. My gnome pager also crashed,

I don't know the Gnome specs for applets, so I can't really answer
your question.  The EWMH spec includes some rules for pager
applications to communicate with desktop environments and this
will eventually be implemented in fvwm.  If your question is only
about swallowing the pager in some gnome specific panel or tool
bar, then it's probably quite easy to do - but keep in mind that
we don't want to introduce new dependencies with third party
libraries without good reason.

So true.  Fvwm is often referred to in statements like 'blablaWM
can be configured for the simple fvwm look as well as ...'.  And
just look at the config that comes with SuSE!  It's so ugly, I
can't even fathom why I ever chose fvwm.

We have taken great pains to make the fvwm code fast, but with
the feature list growing and growing some things start to slow
down noticably.  Moving windows is a fine example.  With all that
paging and SnapAttraction stuff going on it is definitely slower
than on some other window managers.  Also, the code drawing
complex window decorations could be much faster.

I've seen window managers that are no lager than 40k or so and
probably very fast.

Yes, it's a shame.  I often take a look at other window managers
like enlightenment, kwm, blackbox, icewm or saawmill.  They all
have some nifty features (e.g. the window decoration code in E or
some menu features in icewm), but when it comes down to usability
there is almost nothing you can configure to your likings.

That's quite a challenge to start with.  The icon code is
completely independent of the window drawing code.  I think the
cleanest way would be to enhance the code in a way so that the
icon window is actually swallowed in a separate FvwmWindow frame.
Fvwm would have to simulate being an application on its own for
that.  But that requires changes all over the place because fvwm
cant't handle its own client windows than normal app windows (e.g.
it should kill the icon's application with "Destroy", not
itself).  Doing it this way would have the advantage that
implementing tear off menus (planned) can possibly reuse parts of
the code.

No, not exactly :-)

A 'desktop environment' does a whole lot more than a window
manager - it depends on an underlying WM, e.g. dtwm for CDE, kwm
for KDE, sawmill for gnome etc.  Usually, the WM can be replaced
with a different one.  I guess the ratings on the web site refer
to the defaultt window manager coming with the desktop
environment.  DEs aim at providing a consistent application
framework like a common help engine, printing services and tool
bars.

I've just made a correction in the man page.  If 100 is not enough
for someone (s)he can just use 1000 or 10000 or whatever.

Hmm, now the Dominik's machine is in the past (10 Jul), it was in the
future (year 2021) several days ago. :-)

Anyway, both "OpaqueMoveSize unlimited" and "OpaqueMoveSize -1" now do
what Marcus suggested, i.e. force opaque move for all windows.

Mikhael.

Gnome's pager does work well with fvwm desktops, but only with positive
numbered desks. Negative numbers cause the gnome pager applet to crash.

I noticed this some time ago. From what I remember in the X docs, in
theory you could have up to +/- 4 billion desktops, or thereabouts.
Which means that fvwm obeys the X specs, but since gnome crashes, it
does not. At least that's what I think it means. Perhaps some X guru
could explain better.

Hello all,

[Recent convert from Window Maker here! :D  Other window managers may be
prettier than Fvwm, but I've come to realize that *feel* is really what
counts. Kudos to everyone who's worked on this fine project; I think I'll
be sticking with it for a long time to come]

I'm building my own perfect .fvwm2rc file, and would like to have windows
lose their borders/handles when they are maximized. (Both to disable
resizing in an obvious way, and to free up a tad more screen space)

So, as far as I could grok the man page, the way to do this would be with
a decor. The maximize function is thus:

	DestroyFunc FuncMaximize
	AddToFunc FuncMaximize
	+ I Current (!Maximized) ChangeDecor DecorMaximized
	+ I Current (Maximized) ChangeDecor Default
	+ I Maximize

But then, I run into trouble declaring the decor. Below is the code I have
so far:

	# Maximized windows will have no borders or handles
	#
	DestroyDecor DecorMaximized
	AddToDecor DecorMaximized
	+ Style StyleMaximized UseDecor Default, BorderWidth 0, NoHandles

This fails in at least four ways, which are detailed below. If anyone
knows what I'm doing wrong above, or perhaps can think of a better way of
doing this altogether, I'd greatly appreciate hearing from you!


Sincerely,

--Danny


1. BorderWidth and NoHandles are accessible only in a Style command, and
Style is not permitted in a decor definition. (The man page says this,
somewhat indirectly, in the AddToDecor section---but the example given
contradicts that. Bug?). Fvwm complains, and effectively executes the
Style command immediately. (If I replace "StyleMaximized" with "*" then
all windows, maximized or not, lose their borders)

2. "Style" appears to be a bad way of implementing the "borderless
maximize" functionality, because its scope can only be specified by a
window name/class/resource---it cannot be applied to *one specific window*
and no other. If I maximize an XV window, say, and start up another XV
instance elsewhere, the second XV window should have borders!

3. DecorMaximized, as given above, doesn't seem to inherit the effects of
the large number of "Style *" and other ____Style commands that precede
it. Right now, when I maximize a window, the window decorations take on a
distinctly uncustomized look. How do I make DecorMaximized inherit
everything from the Default decor?

4. Even if I jury-rig the first snippet of code to use "Style $n" to
assign "BorderWidth 0 ..." to the maximized window, the borderless window
does not fill the entire screen---it leaves a space at the right and
bottom edges that is twice the normal BorderWidth. Fvwm doesn't seem to be
taking into account the changed dimensions of the window. (Would some
invocation of Recapture do the trick here? How?)

Nice look.  I'll use it when it becomes available if it includes all the current
Title Bar features - multiple configurable buttons, color/theme customizable,
etc.

On the flip side of the coin, is there a way to run Gnome applets without
running their tool bar?  I'd like to run some of their applets but don't want
the Gnome titlebar on my screen.

That explains why their screen shots and configuration files are so out of date.

Which is why FVWM will always have a strong hold on the WM market.  I keep
several window managers on my system.  There are times when I get frustrated
with FVWM, especially when I'm too dumb to figure out how to configure something
such as the title bar font color.  I'll switch over to one of the others and try
to do some work.  Of course none of my key bindings work, I can't switch to
desktop 24 and do some work on my remote server.  Desktop 10 isn't there, and
neither are the IRC clients I keep running there.  I have 24 desktops on FVWM
and a different root background on each.  Those are gone.  Within 10 to 15
minutes I switch back to FVWM so I can get some real work done, and am thankful
it's on my system.

How do I get rid of a window's border.  I have rxvt set with a transparent
background and no title bar, but I can't get rid of it's border.  I'm using:

# Get rid of the default border pixmap
DestroyDecor recreate RXVT
AddToDecor RXVT
+ BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap none
+ BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap none

Style "rxvt"        UseDecor RXVT
Style "rxvt"        NoTitle, sticky, BorderWidth 0, ParentalRelativity

"BorderWidth" doesn't seem to do anything.  I've tried it at many settings but
the border remains unchanged.

Using 2.4.2

When I don't want an window border I set both this variable:

BorderWidth 0 and HandleWidth 0

RedHat 7.x rpm of fvwm-2.4.3 is out.
Mandrake and RedHat 6.x rpms will be hopefully added soon.

I have a request. If anyone who reads this has a stock RedHat 6.1 or
RedHat 6.2 system and wants to help in building rpm, please contact me.
If any SuSE user wants to regularly build SuSE rpms, he may contact me
as well. Creating rpms is automated, but some unix skills are needed.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is not legal, Style like any other command can't appear in decor.
Currently it has the same effect as without "+" and you get a warning.
So, you defined an empty decor (it is not even Default).

There is no contradiction, please read a warning on the standard error.
Fortunately or not, decors do not control border width; styles do.

So, your idea of changing decor for a given window dynamically is good,
but does not help in this specific case.

Yes, Style as we know it now does not help in 100% of cases. In the future
there will be an ability to apply Style to individual windows.

You can't inherit decors, you should recreate them from scratch or
initialize like it is suggested in the link I posted 2 days ago.

If you first remove borders and then Maximize, there should be no any gap
for freely resizable windows. But you can't remove a gap for grid-like
resizable windows like xterm, if you use font 7x14 you may have a gap up
to 6 pixels at the right and up to 13 pixels at the bottom.

Mikhael.

I got your problem. For Style and TitleStyle commands to be applied in the
middle of function you should do UpdateStyles (between Style BorderWidth 0
and Maximize). Otherwise Maximize will indeed take into account borders.

  btw is it just title bar or the borders as well? does it support

  looks quite good...

I saw the warning. I should have been more clear; the contradiction was
that the man page implies that it is illegal to place a Style command
within an AddToDecor definition---and then proceeds to give two code
examples that do exactly that. To quote:

              AddToDecor is similar in usage to the AddToMenu and
              AddToFunc commands, except that menus and functions
              are   replaced   by   ButtonStyle,  AddButtonStyle,
              TitleStyle, AddTitleStyle and BorderStyle commands.

...versus...

              The  following  example creates a decor "FlatDecor"
              and style "FlatStyle".  They are distinct entities:

                   AddToDecor FlatDecor
                    + ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \
                      Inactive (-- flat)
                    + TitleStyle -- flat
                    + BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
                    + Style FlatStyle UseDecor FlatDecor, \
                        Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4

...and...

                   AddToDecor FlatDecor
                    + Style FlatStyle UseDecor FlatDecor, \
                        Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4


Anyway, that's why I thought my StyleMaximized definition was valid at
first. Surely the above is a bug in the documentation, however small...?

Understood. "Style $w" would kill this issue completely.

Found it in the archives ... ooh, that's not pretty. IMHO, dropping decors
in favor of [a more generalized form of] styles seems like a good idea.
Chalk up some definite newbie confusion to the separation (or lack
thereof) between the two.

I got your other message on this, that an interposing UpdateStyles command
is needed. I should have mentioned that the above-mentioned gaps occurred
with XV as the test subject, but no matter now....


Thank you for your help! I look forward to making this work someday :)

I have another screen shot you can look at if you wish:

http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm/fvwm7.jpg

My .fvwm2rc configuration file is there also:

http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm/fvwm2rc

This setup uses a different decor for Xemacs than for the other windows.  Both
the active and inactive window have their own distinct colors.  The TitleBar on
all 3 windows has a cylindrical look.  This is accomplished using the vgradient
option.

The TitleBar buttons use vectors to create the images.  Six I downloaded from the
Fvwm home site, four I created myself.

I make no guarantees that the .fvwm2rc configuration file is without errors.  I
know it can be improved on.  It works, so I'm happy!

Glen

Hello,

I'm using fvwm 2.15 and I've the following problem using the SWX Swiss 
Exchange application ebs_fe. This application allows the user to open a 
wide range of windows and to spread them accross all fvwm virtual screens. 
In each window (called views) he can insert as many panes as he wishes. 
Then he can save his configuration. The next time he opens his application 
and configuration, all previous defined windows should open in the right 
virtual screen and with the geometry they had when saved.
Unfortunately, some windows have often shrunk when the configuration is opened. It isn't link with a configuration 
change because it happens regularly (3 times out of 5) even when the 
configuration hasn't been change for weeks.

Is there any known problem under fvwm 2.15 when an application try to open 
some windows of a specific geomerty at a particular spot on the virtual 
screens.

Thanks for your answers.

Nathalie Luvisetto.

Is it possible to remove the title of the FvwmButtons window?
And is it also possible to turn of the "stipledness" for individual
windows when they are "sticky" (in this case FvwmButtons).
I did set the title font of FvwmButtons to a smaller one than the normal
title font so that the window will get a thinner title bar that
"normal" windows.
Setting: Style "FvwmButtons" NoTitle
removes the title bar entirely. I would still like it to have a title bar.
Can this be done by creating a new decor?

Why exactly do you think this might be an fvwm bug?  Java or
JavaScript apps on web pages that resize, move or create windows
are quite common on the web.

If you can tell me what to do I can make the SuSE rpms along with
the tarballs.

There has never been a release number "2.15".  Perhaps you mean
"2.1.5"?  Anyway, the latest stable release is 2.4.3.  It may be
worthwhile to try it out.

No, I realised this wasn't a bug, so I was going to cancel the message
(ctrl-c in pine) but I accidently sent it (ctrl-x)

The thing was when I switched desktop to move that window within the pager
to be able to access the resize handles.
I somehow moved it over to another desk (not a page), but I dont really
know how (I think the window got sticky somehow...)

No, you can't currently disable stipples for sticky windows, you can only
enable stipples for non-sticky windows.

It took me some time to understand that you want to disable a title text.
The title name of FvwmButtons is either "FvwmButtons" or the module alias
name. You may do some not nice tricks like creating a short alias like "_"
(you can only use alphanumeric chars in alias) or use the same color for
text foreground and background or use invisible font.

Probably a feature to specify a customized static title name for some
windows to display would be interesting, but it is not currently possible.

Or if you really want it now, find the line: list[0] = MyName;
in FvwmButtons.c and specify an empty string "" instead of MyName.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I know that from my own personal preference, I would
like to be able to disable the "stippling" of sticky
windows.

Do you think that this will be implemented in the next
release??? Is it difficult to do??

What do the developers think??

I don't want to add a work for you when you release a distribution.
It may be someone else to do this. Also stock distribution is preferable.
And I don't know how compatible are SuSE 6.x, 7.x, 8.x.

If you really want to do it, first read:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0109/msg00249.html

Verify that you have everything needed installed.
Then in your current developement tree execute "make rpm-dist" as is.

If you managed to create fvwm-2.5.0-0.20011012.i386.rpm, this means you
have everything needed for creating rpms in place, return to me, I will
give you final instructions. If not, nothing bad is happened.

Mikhael.

Hmm, I intended to write this in private, the Reply-To: field did the
wrong thing this time.

It would be too noicy to keep this kind of correspondence that concerns

Dominik, do you think a new ReverseOrder option is useful in any real
situation? It seems too unintuitive for me. And making it a default
for Alt-Tab is more than questionable. At least the previous default
(without ReverseOrder) was totally intuitive.

I think the original request was to preserve the correct window
order, but start over the second menu entry. I.e. with this new
hypotetical option StartAtSecond the menu is:

  Title
  Window 1 (window with the focus)
  Window 2 (window that had the focus before window 1)
  Window 3 (window that had the focus before window 2)
  ...
  Window n (window that had the focus before window n-1)

But the first Alt-Tab points to the Window 2, the next Tab press points
to Window 3 and so on. This would mean enhancements to a menu code.

I want to restore the previous default for Alt-Tab, without ReverseOrder.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just title bars right now.

If you mean transparency through to the root background and
non-rectilinear borders, no. That'll take a little more FVWM programming
expertise than I currently have :-)

Actually, what I meant was running the FVWM Pager outside of FVWM, so that
if I chose I could use it with other window managers. I love using FVWM at
work because it allows me to be extremely productive. However at home I
don't really care what window manager I use, and gnome isn't all that bad,
except that the only pager they have sucks more than a team of hoovers on
"high". I haven't seen a pager as configurable and useful as the one from
FVWM. So I was wondering if it'd be difficult to take the FvwmPager out of
fvwm and generalize it for something like Gnome.

I've been using Nautilus and other stuff for filemanagement, and some of

Howdy, I just started using fvwm2 again after a long Windowmaker
interlude and I'm loving it.  I have one problem however.  I use
gnuserv with xemacs.  This allows me to open new emacs frames using
the gnuclient command.  (These frames are attached to the same xemacs
process.)

What I want is for these windows to appear right where I am (page and
desk wise) just as if I'd run xemacs.  However they now pop up in
strange places.  I wish I could be more exact but unfortunately I
haven't actually figured out exactly what the pattern is.  I think
they seem to show up the last place I used an xemacs frame and I'm
guessing that this has something to do with "window groups".  Am I off
base here?

Clues gratefully accepted.  Thanks, Daniel.

Daniel,

As for guaranteeing that it stays on the same desk/page that you start the
process from even if Xemacs is somewhere else, someone with more FVWM expertise
will have to answer that question.

In the mean time you should be able to easily access it by placing the following
in your .fvwm2rc configuration file:

Mouse 3	RS    	A      	WindowList

This will bring up the list of all open windows by right clicking on the sides
of an open window or on the root window.

You can try adding this to your xemacs configuration file (you'll need to modify it for
your personal tastes):

;; Set default page size  and start location
(setq initial-frame-plist '(top 34 left 7 width 108 height 40))  ; I don't know why but this is the setting
(setq default-frame-plist '(top 5 left 0 width 108 height 40))

That should place the new frame in a specific spot on the screen.  Don't know if
it will force it to start on the same desk/page or not.

I just built an rpm on a Red Hat 7.0 i586 machine.  I'd appreciate it if
some/any of you would be willing to test it out to see if it installs for you.
It installed fine on my machine, but I'd appreciate some feedback.  You can find
the rpm and source rpm at:

And my lame attempt at making ones for RedHat 6.2 can be found here:

http://www.niceboots.com/~tenebrae/fvwm/

http://www.niceboots.com/~tenebrae/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.3-1.i386.rpm
http://www.niceboots.com/~tenebrae/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.3-1.src.rpm

I would also appreciate feedback.
Thanks.

While we're on the subject, I just created the rpms for Red Hat 6.1 and uploaded
them to http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm.

http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.3-1.rh6.1.i386.rpm
http://members.fcwm.org/glen/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.3-1.rh6.1.src.rpm

And any comments will be welcome.  The install worked on my stock 6.1 RH box.

It seems that the Tenebrae's system was upgraded to include more recent
packages from RH 7.x, such as glibc, rpm, XFree86. So this rpm can't be
installed on RH 6.x. without a big upgrade. It also lacks support for
gdk-imlib.

The rpm of Glen seems to be fully ok, but it uses a not very good release
number 1.rh6.1.

We already exchanged a dozen of emails with Tenebrae and Glen and I will
continue to do this in private. Let keep quality on this list, not
quantity.

Regards,
Mikhael.

hello,

so i was playing with my pager, and i did an FvwmIdent on it.

it said that geometry is 44x33+0+0, but that the width is
179, Height is 33, X(Current Page) is 0, Y(Current page) is
0

the question is, should the geometry not have read:

179x33+0+0?

is is a bug with a problem, or is it a bug with the user (in
that i am confused about what geometry is supposed to mean)?

thanks.

denis

Geometry means logical units specific to the given application window.

Compare, for example, xv and xterm. The actual width and height of xv
window is the same as its geometry, i.e. its logical unit has size 1x1.
But in xterm the logical unit is a character cell, something like 7x13
depending on a font you use. In addition, there is a non-removable part
in xterm, its scrollbar, that is not included in geometry.

In case of FvwmPager, the geometry is the size of a single page.
You use the desk that has 4x1 pages and you disable the pager label. So:
  The total X size is 44*4 plus 3 separators = 179.
  The total Y size is 33.

If you would use 3x2 pages with fixed-font label you would get:
  The total X size is 44*3 plus 2 separators = 134.
  The total Y size is 33*2 plus 1 separator + 16-pixel label = 83.

In both cases above, the geometry of the pager would still be 44x33.
If this is still mysterious, think what should happen when you resize
xv, xterm, FvwmPager. The geometry is changed in +1 / -1 logical unit.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I just returned to using fvwm after some absence and have been spending
a bit of time looking at the change logs for 2.4 and see a new windows
shading approach from the email announcing the new release.  I don't
quite understand how this is used in my .fvwm2rc.  I have a redhat
system that I use the fvwm-themes on from the sourceforge.net site and
it works.  

I would like to roll a window up to its titlebar but I also saw no
responses when I searched the fvwm mailing list archives.

I believe I went through the FAQ but I don't see a mention of it.  I am
using the most recent debian unstable package and a somewhat hacked
.fvwm2rc file.

Thanks for any help you can provide including pointing me to a sample
.fvwm2rc file from which I could lift the required commands to lift a
window up to its titlebar.

Here's what I use so that double-clicking the titlebar shades the window:

Mouse 1 T N Function TitlebarLeftClick

AddToFunc TitlebarLeftClick
   + I Raise
   + M Move
   + D WindowShade

Ugh, no, that wouldn't be easy at all.  FvwmPager totally relies
on fvwm's module interface and even fvwm's built in commands.
Basically this would entail rewriting 50% of the code.

I'm planning to vastly enhance the concept of styles anyway.  Part
of this will be to allow state specific styles, e.g. something
like

  Style (sticky) StipledTitlesOff

BUt don't expect this to work soon.

Exactly.  With fvwm-2.4.x you can tell fvwm to ignore window
gropu placement with

  Style * ScatterWindowGroups

Actually, I found the old behaviour totally unintuitive and the
new one much better.  Not that I care much about that, I only
thought it was closer to that M$ stuff.

The old behaviour looked backwards through the window list.  You
could not walk through the list by pressing Alt-Tab repeatedly.
Instead, focus was toggled between the current window and the last
one that had the focus.

Yes.  I find this very confusing because the order of windows gets
messed up each time I press Alt-Tab.  The idea of the new code was
this:  If I have some windows, then I can always switch from
window A to window B by pressing Alt-Tab, say, n times.  It does
not matter if window C had the focus in between or D, E and F...

> I want to restore the previous default for Alt-Tab, without ReverseOrder.

In the end, I really don't care.  Do whatever you think is the
most nice and intuitive Alt-Tab behaviour.

  IMO it would be nice if this were configurable: I like the windows to
be ordered in the order they were last visited, e.g. the current window
is on top, the window focused before is second etc...

  that way the most used windows are on the top of the list (I usually
actively use only few windows), the most used windows are easiest to
access.

  this is how ms win alt-tab works and it's one of the few things I like
in ms win and would like to be able to configure fvwm to work exactly
the same way...

  it would be nice to have an option of static list or dynamic list
('recentness' list). Including being able to filter list but I think
that works already (in 2.4, I haven't got around to play with 2.4 config
yet).

hello,

is it possible to maximize a window, but so that it only
goes up to something like 150 pixels from the top of the
page, but takes up the whole width?

thanks,

denis

I don't exactly understand if you want.  Try one of these:

  # 150 pixels high at 0 0
  Maximize 0 +150p

  # (screen height - 150 pixels) at 0 0
  Maximize 0 -150p

  # 150 pixels high at bottom of screen
  AddToFunc MaximizeAtBottom
  + I Maximize $0 $1
  + Move -0 -0
  MaximizeAtBottom 0 150p

  # (screen height - 150 pixels) at bottom of screen
  AddToFunc MaximizeAtBottom
  + I Maximize $0 $1
  + Move -0 -0
  MaximizeAtBottom 0 -150p

Bye

An additional Alt-Tab was the only difference from that MS stuff.
ReverseOrder didn't make it closer at all. It allows to walk through the
list by pressing a single Alt-Tab, but has a side effect that I called
unintuitive, it starts from the oldest visited window instead of the
most recent one.

I myself prefer the default in 2.4.0 over the MS stuff, i.e. it's ok that
the first Alt-Tab points to the already focused window not to the second
one, but I don't care as long as the list is recent-first (not reversed).

The chosen window jumps to the top of the list. With ReverseOrder the list
is reversed, so it jumps to the bottom, there is the same logical "mess".

This may be used for switching between 2 applications, but there are
better solutions IMO for this than WindowList, for example:

  Key 1 A C Current SetEnv WID1 $$w
  Key 1 A M WindowListFunc $$[WID1]
  Key 2 A C Current SetEnv WID2 $$w
  Key 2 A M WindowListFunc $$[WID2]

No need to count or see a list of unrelevant windows, just one press to
bookmark a window and another to switch to it from anywhere.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

Suppose that I want to put a window in a free space whose size is 
MxN. Suppose that the application in the window is such that
using multiples of the logical unit cannot be MxN for reasons of 
divisibility. 
Is there a way to put the window in such a way that it exactly 
fills the free space. 
(I have such problems with emacs: I cannot adjust the size 
so that it coincides exactly with what is free on my screen).

Thanks,
Laurent.

The only thing you can do is to try different font sizes.

I have this line in my .fvwm2rc and it doesn't seem to do anything.
New xemacs windows still appear on desks other than the current one.

Ouch... I'm embarrassed.  After seeing further inexplicable problems
with fvwm2 I realized that there are two versions of fvwm2 installed
on the computer systems here.  They just upgraded the Linux systems
here and they didn't upgrade my brain at the same time.  It looks like
ScatterWindowGroups works now, as it well should.

Thanks,
Daniel.

To use FVWM, you need an X Server.

There are lots of X Servers that work with windows.

You can download Cygwin, and XFree 86.  FVWM will work with that.

With that sort of setup, what happens to the native Windows desktop - Start
menu/Task bar, shortcut icons, etc.?  Is it all covered up a la
PowerPoint's slide show mode?

The last version of XFree 86 I downloaded worked inside a window.
Ie., the entire desktop is shown in 1 window.

  depends on X server, following modes of operation are often supported:

  X windows are native windows, managed as native windows (they have the
same title/borders etc as native ms win programs)

  X windows are regular windows, managed by X window manager (local or
remote wm)

  X desktop is created as a window or full screen, all X windows are
within this desktop windows, you have to use X wm to managhe windows,

  in case of fullscreen X desktop you can still use some windows
shortcuts (usually at least alt-tab and ctrl-esc), sometime you can make
taskbar visible.

  not all X servers support all modes...

My experience with X servers is limited to the Unix world, so I'm in unfamiliar
territory here.  Suppose I wanted a "standardized" (fvwm-based) desktop for a
mixed network of Unix boxes and PCs (the latter running Win 2K).  On the PCs, I
would want a fullscreen X desktop.  I suspect I would need a way to get to the
native Win 2K taskbar without exiting the X server.

1.  Which Win-compatible X servers have people tried that fill this bill?  Any
positive experiences with one in particular?

2.  Am I correct in assuming that fvwm itself would have to be "served" from a
Unix box, e.g., with a "-display" argument?

dont remember how, but the cygwin server actually did allow
me to switch to windows desktop. i remember it being
painfully slow though. on the other hand, you should not
need to :)

no. x server is running on the PC itself. this is exactly
where the fvwm is served from.

  I guess all of them, I only have experience with exceed, viewnow and
reflection (I am not sure about the name of the last one, it was long
time ago). Just run it fullscreen.

  it can run anywhere. AFAIK you can compile it on windows machine using
cygwin tools and run it locally or run it from some unix machine.

  another option is using vncserver on one of the unix machines and
vncviewer one windows machine. that way, if windows machine crashes you
don't care, just restart viewer. Or connect to the same X desktop from
different computers (that's what I use for telecommuting).

So sorry to hear that...I'd probably just make my desktop a dual boot Linux
box and do as much as I could outside of Windoze (using Wine and/or Windoze
under Plex86 when needed) but I understand if that might not be feasible...

Chaim> does fvem work with windows, or if nt does anything else do

Although the Cygwin/XFree86 solution suggested here previously would work, and
have some other beneficial side effects like having access to all of the nice
powerful UNIX command line tools, but there is another choice: LiteStep.  It's
a port of AfterStep (which was derived from fvwm) directly to Windoze as a
replacement for the normal desktop there.

I've only played with it a little, since I try and avoid Windoze as much as
possible, but some other people who I know that use it reported that their
system seemed to crash much less often while they were using it.  Thought that
was pretty funny... :)

The website I have bookmarked for it is here:

                           http://www.litestep.net/

but it appears to be down right now (also try .com instead of .net as I think
that is another site for it).  Try a Google search.  Actually, I just did one
and it looks like this is the new home:

                               http://ls2k.org/

also came up with this site as well:

                          http://www.desktopian.org/

that you might find interesting (looks like they have several other similar
projects pointed to from there).

Hope this helps.

HI

I tried to set the 'wait' cursor to my own xpm file by 
using


CursorStyle WAIT /home/jos/waitcursorshade.xpm
BusyCursor * True


but still, my wait cursor is not displayed.
Eg when I start netscape from the commandline, 
I still see a watch. To see if the xpm file
is valid I tried


CursorStyle NORMAL /home/jos/waitcursorshade.xpm


Then I do see the my cursor, however the black
and white colors are reversed. After I manually 
reversed the colors in the xpm file, it displayed
correctly. I use fvwm-2.4.2. Should the cursor 
maybe be bm file?


best regards

jos

HI

Another small question. I'm writing a gnome panel
applet and I'd like to make it so that a mouse
click on a part of the applet, causes a 'move' 
action to be started for the entire panel. So I 
thought I'd maybe use FvwmCommand to do this. But
from FvwmConsole

next (panel,acceptsfocus) move

doesn't work. I also tried 'panel_resource' instead
of 'panel'. Any suggestions on how to make this 
work? 


best regards

jos

There is no cursor context NORMAL (there is DEFAULT), so I don't know what
exactly worked for you.

The pixmap cursor should be xpm with 3 colors:

  None    - the transparent part
  black   - outer cursor color (foreground)
  white   - inner cursor color (background)

As usual you may specify actual colors in the CursorStyle command itself:

  CursorStyle ROOT top_left_arrow.xpm yellow navy

If you have fvwm-themes, take a look under themes/multichoice/cursors/,
there are several pixmap cursor configs and xpms.

Send your waitcursorshade pixmap if you still have problems with it.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello

I am running WinNT4.0 with cygwin/latest plus XFree86 and lesstif-0_93_0
with fvwm-2.4.3.

In fvwm on a Motif application within an XmOptionMenu, which is something like a
popup menu in a XmRowColumn, when I mouse right click, the arrow pointer goes right
and sticks. I have to kill the XFree86 base window. I had the same problem in mwm.

I see something in the faq which says the pointer is waiting for a 
callback in the name of the menu, but I don't think it applies here.

Has anyone had this problem - is there a cure? Can I use the window
manager to turn off mouse right click as a trigger to the Option
menu? (my least desired alternative)

The fvwm is a big improvement over what I was using (twm, mwm). Thanks
for the hard work.

David

Unrelated: my panel version has "panel_window" not "panel_resource".

Most of people use "Style panel CirculateSkip", so you should use:

  Next (panel, CirculateHit) Move

This may not do what you want if there are more than one panel (or even if
there are several subpanels). Then this may be used (CirculateHit has no
effect with All):

  All (panel) Move

It took me some time to figure out why this still does not work even if
Iconify instead of Move does work. Panel sets a location hint that FVWM
respects. You should use Style option VariablePosition to ignore it.

  Style panel VariablePosition
  All (panel) Move 0 100p          # return to the bottom: Move 0 -0

Mikhael.

HI!

I still have difficulty displaying the right cursor. To 
test the cursor commands, I made a .fvwm2rc with only
these three lines:

BusyCursor * True
CursorStyle WAIT /home/jos/waitcursorshade.xpm white black
CursorStyle ROOT /home/jos/waitcursorshade.xpm white black

then on the root the cursor is displayed correctly, but
when I start up netscape, or when netscape is looking for
a www page, I still see a watch. Could it be that netscape
displays it's own cursor, or that this has to be set in 
an xresources file? I'll include the xpm file below.

best regards

jos

HI!


I just noticed that in another program, the wait cursor
does display correctly! Only with netscape I see a watch
instead of my own cursor..

Exactly.

This is in my Netscape.ad file:

! Mouse cursor when awaiting a reply.
*busyCursor:			watch

FVWM only controls the cursors in the FVWM areas of the screen,
the menus, titlebars, frames, screen edges...

Hello,

I have a problem with Key bindings in XFree86 4.1.0.

fvwm2 -version says:
FVWM version 2.4.0 compiled on Aug 13 2001 at 13:54:45
with support for: ReadLine, XPM, SM

and uname -mprs:
FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE i386

These are my keybindings:
Key 1		A	CM	MoveToPage 0 0
Key 2		A	CM	MoveToPage 1 0
Key 3		A	CM	MoveToPage 0 1
Key 4		A	CM	MoveToPage 1 1
Key Home        A       M       Next (*) Focus
Key End         A       M       Prev (*) Focus
Key F4		A	SM	Destroy
Key F4		A	M	Close
Key F5		A	M	Move
Key F5		A	SM	Shade-and-Raise
Key F7		A	M	Resize
Key F8		A	M	Iconify
Key F9		A	M	Exec exec xkill

Key Left	A	CM	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	CM	Scroll +100 0
Key Up		A	CM	Scroll 0 -100
Key Down	A	CM	Scroll 0 +100
Key Left	A	M	CursorMove -5 0
Key Right	A	M	CursorMove +5 0
Key Up		A	M	CursorMove 0 -5
Key Down	A	M	CursorMove 0 +5
Key F1		A	M	Menu RootMenu Nop
Key F2		A	M	Menu Window-Ops Nop
Key F3		A	M	WindowList

Till some weeks ago, I used Xaccel and all the Keybindings worked
well. But then I bought a new videocard which is not supported by
Xaccel. Since then i'm using XFree86 in version 4.1.0. After I
log in over xdm, the keybindings are working, but after a while
they are all gone. Anybody knows how to handle this?

bye,
Danijel Tasov

Check the FVWM FAQ, start with question 0.1:

0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse
     bindings stop working.  What can I do?

A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See
   Q 5.5 for more details.

Hello,

I have a problem which I didn't solve after one day of testing 
different configurations in the fvwm95.rc  Perhaps somebody can 
give me a hint...

Is it possible to configure in the fvwm95rc the maximal size of a 
window that it can have without overlapping the TaskBar at the 
bottom of the desktop (like it is in Windows)? I have always the 
problem that Netscape hides the TaskBar (no AutoHide configured). 
If I try to make the windows of Netscape smaller (with the geometry-
flag), it reduces it's size always at the top, but never at the bottom, 
so that doesn't help me. And I don't manage to change the position 
of Netscape - it seems to ignore -geometry +0+0.

This configuration is for public use of computers in a library, and 
the users should see from the beginning that there is a taskbar, 
without the need to change the size of Netscape manually.

So the easiest way for me would be to say in the fvwm95rc "Make 
the window as big as possible without overlapping the TaskBar at the 
bottom". Is this possible? Or does anybody know why Netscape 
ignores the -geometry +0+0 argument?

Thank you very much for your help.

Bye

Stefan

I'm using the fvwm2-2.2.4-4 rpm on RedHat 6.2.

I've got this in my .fvwm2rc files:

GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises
# Style * MouseFocusClickRaises
# switch to this with fvwm 2.4
# click anywhere in a window to raise it

It works fine, except when the Num Lock is on.  Is there any way to fix
this?  It works fine with the caps lock on and I don't care about scroll
lock (which doesn't work either).

Thanks,

Hello,

I would like to be able to select fvwm2 directly from kdm rather than
choosing failsafe at the kdm login and then running fvwm2 manually.
I would still like to have kdm rather than xdm on the login screen.
I am running Red Hat 7.1 with kde 2.1.1 and the latest fvwm2 version
of course. I have done the following to /etc/X11/xdm/kdmrc:

#SessionTypes=default,kde,gnome,failsafe
SessionTypes=default,kde,gnome,fvwm2,failsafe

This shows me an fvwm2 option but when I log in I end up with kde rather
than fvwm2. What other configuration files must I configure for fvwm2
to start up when I log in?

Thanks,

Neil

i wanted almost this, thanks! (i should've looked in the
manual pages more, but Move -0 -0 is a nice trick which i
did not know about)

   # (screen height - 150 pixels) at bottom of screen
   AddToFunc MaximizeAtBottom
   + "I" Maximize $0 $1
   + "I" Move -0 -0

   MaximizeAtBottom 100 -90p

the problem now, however, is that once i maximize the
window, it is fine, but once i click my button to
de-maximize it, it stays with its lower-right corner in the
lower-right portion of the screen. this makes sense, since
that's exactly what Move -0 -0 did.

the question, is whether i can somehow figure out where the
window was positions before executing my MaximizeAtBottom,
and moving the window back?

thanks,

denis

You should edit (or create) an ~/.xsession file that look like:

# things you want to do before starting your session

case in $1 
    
    default)
       fvwm2
    ;;

Hello,

With the current fvwm devel version FvwmScript is fully keyboard
controlable: you can go around the widget with (Shift)-Tab and
return simulate a mouse click (see the NoFocus flag too).
Moreover, you can also define some key bindings.
For example if you have:

# in the init function:
Key U C 33 1

Widget 33
Main
 Type PushButton
 Title {OpenUrl}
 ...
End
Case message of
 SingleClic :
 Begin
  SendSignal 33 1
 End
 1 :
 Begin
   # bloc of instruction to open the Url
 End
End

Then Ctl-U will open your url.

i wonder if the same type of solution Dominik suggested for my
earlier question would work for you as well. there may very
well be much better ways of doing things, so you may want to
see what others have to say :)

# (screen height - 90 pixels) at top of the screen
AddToFunc MaximizeAtBottom
+ "I" Maximize $0 $1
+ "I" Move +0 +0
     
MaximizeAtBottom 100 -90p

that should basically maximize a window 100% horizontally,
and 100% - 90 pixels vertically, then move it to the upper
left hand corner. you could change 90 to be the width of the
taskbar.

2)

as i was looking through man fvwm2 for 2.4.3, i saw the
"grow" argument to the Maximize command. i did not play with
it, but it also sounds like it could do what you want. not
sure though..

I got rid of the /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients file
and replaced it with this:

Hello,

To enable selection of fvwm2 from the kdm login it is sufficient to add an
entry to add fvwm2 to the SessionTypes line in /etc/X11/xdm/kdmrc and also
add the lines

    fvwm2)
       exec /usr/local/bin/fvwm2
       ;;

in the /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession file.

For some reason the .xsession file in my home directory was not being
detected by the startup scripts so I opted for this alternative.

Have a nice day,

Neil

A little word of warning: Don't forget the ";;", because then it's not
possible to log in even failsafe. The check for failsafe shouldn't really
be in switch block but rather in an if statement before....

I've been using a multi-desktop add-on* on my NT for some time anyway,
so when I use an XServer for NT, I just give it it's own desktop.  Works
quite well.
(* I've tried quite a few freeware and shareware solutions, and decided
I liked PerfectScreens best.  YMMV.)

I'm running FVWM 2.4.3 under Linux using the Accelerated X server
(www.xig.com).  This is the Debian testing distribution, so I've got
Gnome 1.4 and I'm using Fvwm2 as my window manager.

If I look in ~/.gnome-errors, I find:

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: Help

I think this must be something Accelerated X doesn't support or something.
This happens before my .fvwm2rc file is loaded.

[FVWM][GetWindowSizeHints]: <<WARNING>> XMMS window 0x400001a has broken (max_width) size hints
Please report this to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org
hint override = 0
flags = 30
min_width = 0, min_height = 0, max_width = 0, max_height = 0

base_width = 1075438280, base_height = 136136264
win_gravity = 136136264

I'm running gkrellm from my init function in my .fvwm2rc file, with
the gkrelmms module. It automatically loads xmms and then minimizes
it.

Anyway, everything seems to work OK, but I was told to report the error :-)

HI!!

I'm writing gtk program which lets pop up
a gtk menu in the torn-off state, ie the
menu has it's own window with decorations,
and a window name.

Now, when the menu pops up for the first time,
it works fine. But, when it pops again, 
fvwm warps back to the desktop on which the 
menu appeared for the first time. Maybe gtk
just hides the window, and when it is unhidden
fvwm thinks that it has to be displayed in 
another desktop. 

Does anyone know an fvwm workaround for this?

best regards

jos

I can't find info on how to set up in my .fvwm2rc file so that my PC
keyboard keys to map to Cut, Paste, and Copy keys that are otherwise
available on Sun workstation keyboards. Can you explain how to do this or
point me to where I can find out?

Thanks!

The mapping of your keyboard keys is not controlled by FVWM.
Instead the X emulator controls this.

If you are using Exceed, go to Xconfig, pick Input.
If you need help beyond this or are not using Exceed,
ask again with more information.

First, let me say that I really like FVWM2 and the fairly simple rc-file
syntax. It's really nice to be able to set things quickly and easily to
work the way I like. It's also nice to be able to fit my WM on a floppy.

That's it for my compliments, now on to my complaints ;)

This may be a small thing to some, but it is important when I've set up
my machine and want to use it as a desktop Linux box(and get jealous
when using MSWindows). One thing I've noticed is that my windows are
pretty slow to draw when I move them around (I use opaque windows, and
no icons, just a large (1-2MB) .xpm for a background and a desktop at
1600x1200). However, the one that is very quick is XMMS. Since I've got
DRI working, as well, OGL stuff is fast, as well, but, AFAIK, there
aren't any OGL window managers. I thought this was curious. One friend
of mine suggested that it was because XMMS uses a small window. However,
when I move, say, an xload window (a small one) it moves choppily, too.
At first, I just chalked this all up to X being slow. However, today, I
tried something different. I installed an older version of WindowMaker
(whatever came with Slackware 7.1... 0.62.1) on my box and got it
working. To my surprise, the windows (using opaque moving) moved around
significantly smoother than FVWM2. So, my question is: why is
WindowMaker faster than FVWM2 at redrawing windows? Can I make FVWM2
faster at redrawing windows? Do other people notice this, as well?

Thanks again, it's a nice WM, aside from the choppy windows :).

gtk_window_set_title doesn't work?
In my app I wnat to have my popup window look different than my main
app which is a windowless app how can I do this ?

gtk_window_set_title
calls

 XmbSetWMProperties

Also tried

gtk_window_set_wmclass

which I think calls XsetClasssHint

Can anyone tell me the right X call to communicate with the window manager
so my window can get decorated correctly?

One reason is that fvwm does a lot of things during window motion.
You can speed this up by not using some of the functionality:

 - Turn off SnapGrid and SnapAttraction
 - Use simple window decorations without gradients or pixmaps
 - Use only one page per desk (DesktopSize 1x1)

Another reason can be backing storage and saving window contents
obscured by other windows.  If both are turned off, X has to do a
lot of extra drawing, but it actually depends on the video card
(and the applications) if the additional drawing is faster or
slower than caching the contents (because reading from the video
card is usually much slower than writing to it).  Try if either

  Style * BackingStore, SaveUnder

or

  Style * BackingStoreOff, SaveUnderOff

helps.

A stack trace might help.  Type:

gdb `whence fvwm2` $HOME/core

type in "where", send the result.

If you don't have "gdb", try the same command with "dbx".

fvwm did not leave a core.  Do I need to coerce it somehow?
(BTW, whence does not exist on most systems, use which.)

In my experience, if it crashes, it leaves a core.

Does it leave a message on stderr?

Sorry about whence, when I'm not in ksh, I'm in sh.

gtk_window_set_title works for me. As well as gtk_window_set_wmclass.

gtk_window_set_wmclass has no effect (run-time warning) if you call it
after gtk_widget_show(window); gtk_window_set_title works dynamically.

If you still have problems with these 2 functions, create a minimal
example that shows the problem and sent it.

Mikhael.

I see this with all gtk programs, weird.

The problem is solved if you make the menu window sticky:

  Style "My tearoff menu" Sticky

A better solution, I guess, is to set a sticky window hint for tearoff
menus using gnome hints.

Probably there is another solution, I don't quite understand yet why
this happens in the first place.

Apparenly the default somewhere in slackware 8 is to not do

I don't think anyone is going to be able to get anywhere with that.

Note that the stack doesn't lead back up to main() and
that there are bunch of functions at different addresses all claiming
to be XMapRaised.

I see this frequently, but I haven't got a good list of the causes.

Perhaps fvwm just needs to be recompiled with -g, or your gdb
needed to be upgraded to match the gcc that this was compiled with,
or the fvwm2 in your path doesn't match the core file, or the file
system the core file is on ran out of space and got truncated.

Use the FvwmBacker module.

  I just got similar error recently, I guess in this case it's because
the size of window is 0, it's more of a problem of the application than
fvwm, as far as I can tell (based on Dominik's explanation)

New windows are automatically raised unless you configured them to be on
the bottom layer using the Style command.

For all new windows to automatically get focus, use:

  Style * GrabFocus

If you want to do something more with new windows, see FAQ 3.18.

If i want to scroll +100000+0 and focus and raise the last focused window on
that page, how do i do that. Right now i have a ugly function like this:

AddToFunc ScrollRight		
+				"I" Scroll +100000+0
+				"I" Next (CurrentPage !Iconic) Focus

but that doesn't work as satisfying as i want it too. Any other ideas?

Hello,

I am using fvwm2 with sample2 startup and each time it seems to
me fvwm2 starts up in a different one of the 9 windows in the
primary desktop.

How do I get it to start up in the same window each time,
preferably 0, 1

I didn't think that looked very useful.  The fvwm2 binary was
being stripped so even though it was compiled with -g there
was no symbol info.  Here is a fixed gdb output:

Hi!

I installed version 1.4.3 of xfm on a x86 Redhat 7.1 system using this
rpm: http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/~ag/xfm/xfm-1.4.3-1.i386.rpm

When starting xfm, fvwm2 crashes. Should I recompile fvwm2 with -g  and
reproduce this (it always happens) and send in the core file and a stack
trace? Or is this a known problem?

//Marcus

No, this is not known. I just installed this package and can't reproduce
any problem with xfm and fvwm from cvs. If you have a stripped executable
with no debug info, please recompile it and send the stack trace to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.

Hi,
I am rather new to fvwm. I use fvwm 1 and got fvwmrc file from a friend, and 
now trying to re-configure it myself. I am still too lazy to move to fvwm2.

My question: is it possible to use icon in menu, beside the text in fvwm 1.x? 
If yes, how? I've seen some screenshot of this in fvwm homepage, but I think 
that's is using fvwm2. 

Thanks for any replies.
Reuben D. Budiardja

The only icons fvwm-1.x supports is the ones used for iconified windows.
It does not support menu icons or application mini icons.

Fvwm1 does not offer the menu icon facility.
Furthermore, Fvwm1 is no longer supported by the FVWM
team.

I really do recommend that you upgrade to the latest
stable release of FVWM2 (I'm using
Fvwm2-2.4.2)......it's still the best window manager
for Linux :-)

Yeah. Now I am thinking about it (upgrading). I'll do it when I have time to 
re-write the rc files.
One thing that would be helpful is that if there are the rc files in fvwm 
homepage. I saw some beautiful screenshot there. It should be great if there 
are rc files together with the screenshot that we can download. and then we 
can re-configure it ourselves.

Fvwm(2)  comes  with a conversion  script that  will  convert an fvwm1
.fvwmrc file to .fvwm2rc format.

You can use fvwm-themes which comes with lots of pre-configured
looks.

One of the screenshots does have a link to its .fvwm2rc file.

I just installed fvwm-2.4.3, and it only has fvwm24_convert, which the manual 
page says it only converts fvwm-2.2.x files. I need to use fvwmrc_convert to 
convert from 1.x rc file to 2.2.x convert files first. But I don't find that 
script.

Does this mean I have to install fvwm-2.2.x first? 

Thanks.

fvwmrc_convert should be there,

I got some more info.

 > #0  0x809354a in setup_window_placement (tmp_win=0x80f02b0, pstyle=0xbffff1c0)
 >     at add_window.c:578

The line it quits at is:

578         MergeCmdLineResources(
579           &db, table, 4, client_argv[0], &client_argc, client_argv, True);

(gdb) print db
$1 = 0x80f08b0
(gdb) print table
$2 = {{option = 0x80b3a25 "-workspacf", specifier = 0x80b3a1f "*junk", 
    argKind = XrmoptionSepArg, value = 0x0}, {option = 0x80b3a14 "-workspace", 
    specifier = 0x80b3a0e "*desk", argKind = XrmoptionSepArg, value = 0x0}, {
    option = 0x80b3a09 "-xrn", specifier = 0x0, argKind = XrmoptionResArg, 
    value = 0x0}, {option = 0x80b3a04 "-xrm", specifier = 0x0, 
    argKind = XrmoptionResArg, value = 0x0}}
(gdb) print client_argv[0]
Cannot access memory at address 0x0
(gdb) print client_argc
$3 = 0
(gdb) print client_argv
$4 = (char **) 0x0

client_argv is NULL, which is most likely what is causing the seg fault.
Is there some convention or RFC that implies that client_argv should
not have a NULL value?

Either way, it is a bug in FVWM (IMHO).  Fvwm should be able to handle
anything a client throws at it.

I'm sure I could hack something to get around this bug, but I'd rather
it was fixed in the "correct" manner. Does anyone have a fix or a
suggestion as to what the right way to fix this is?

Thanks,

Dan

This is something that *I* would love to see......what
does Dominik think of this??? Obviously some part of
the webpage would have to be added to, and the
original person that submitted the screenshot would
have to submit their .fvwm2rc file.

But I don't think there's a problem?!?

In the meantime, I'm sure some of the people whose screenshots grace the
online world may still be lurking in here (like me).  If there's a
screenshot or two that you'd like the rc file for, ask and you may
receive.

It's already fixed in CVS.

Hello,

Is there anyone who uses FvwmGtk extensively?

I'm trying to create some basic dialog boxes with FvwmGtk
instead of the usual FvwmForm.

I tried invoking a test dialog box both these ways:

	Module FvwmForm FvwmForm-Form
        SendToModule FvwmGtk FvwmGtk-Test


The file FvwmGtk-Test I created under /usr/local/share/fvwm,
the directory where the other FvwmForms/Scripts are kept.
-->
--------
DestroyModuleConfig  FvwmGtk-Test: *
*FvwmGtk-Test:  Dialog FvwmGtk-Test "Testing FvwmGtk"
*FvwmGtk-Test:  Label "Testing FvwmGtk"
--------

Should'nt I be atleast seeing an empty box,
whenever I invoke it?

I wasn't able to get it to work, maybe I missed something..
the man page I did go through, but some more explanation
or perhps an example or two would be very useful.


I use FvwmForm and FvwmScript for a lot of tasks and I'd
like to try the same with FvwmGtk, as well. Gtk has some
keyboard bindings which may make things easy for a user.


I'm running fvwm 2.4.0, compiled from source,
and configured during compilation to include the FvwmGtk
module with gtk support.

I also have gtk on my system, latest version, compiled
from source.



Any tips on this particalar Module would be very welcome.


Faiz

I think FvwmGtk is very underestimated, its widget set is very good.
The scriptability of FvwmGtk is not the best though.
I can't find any screenshot of FvwmGtk except for this one:

The man page of FvwmGtk implies that you know how to run this module
(by running Module FvwmGtk with optional alias).
You should also explicetly Read the configuration; unlike FvwmForm and
FvwmScript files are not automatically found and read. So you should do:

  Read file-name
  Module FvwmGtk alias-name
  SendToModule alias-name dialog-name

You used the same name for file, alias and dialog, but this is not
required. So in your case you should do:

  Read FvwmGtk-Test
  Module FvwmGtk FvwmGtk-Test
  SendToModule FvwmGtk-Test FvwmGtk-Test

If you have more questions, I would like to answer.

Is it possible to get a button (in FvwmButtons) that looks "flat" (no
3D border) when not pressed and "sunken in" when pressed?
"Frame 0" makes the button borderless all the time.
I guess it could perhaps be possible to define light/shaded colours
differently for these states, such that in non pressed mode the borders
get drawn using the background colour. Colorsets?

Is it possible to get the pager to NOT show certain windows?
I had FvwmButtons in mind.
I found options to hide icons. Their is options to leave out windows in
the windowlist, maybe I missed something their (it seems a bit related).

No, that feature is already on the wish list, but not implemented
yet.

I don't think so.

Dear list,

I am an user of  lovely AnotherLevel desktop. I got it from RedHat 5 and
6.2 realases.
I have now installed RedHat 7.1 on some machines and I would like to
come back
to AnotherLevel which is not the default on the FVWM window manager.

How can I make it my default desktop? Hopefully, it should be possible.

Thanks in advance

Jose Maria Martin Olalla


PS:

I beg all your pardon. I tried FAQ and the mailing list but I faild in
finding an answer to my question.

Hello,

I too use AnotherLevel and it is an extrememly
efficient M4 pre-processor. Which style are you
using?? I like to use the MWM (Lestiff) style the
most.

To answer your question, you have to obtain the
original AnotherLevel rpm from your RedHat
distribution and install it on your machine.

If you already have customised "fvwm2.*****.rc" files
then make sure that these appear in your home
directory.

Then to use it, you have to use:

startx

making sure that startx loads the following:

RunWM.MWM

(edit startx as appropriate).

Furthermore, you should change the content of the
following file:

"/etc/sysconfig/desktop"

and delete whatever it says in there and put

MWM

You could install AnotherLevel from the latest Red Hat distro that contained
it (RH6.2), but you might instead take a peek at

	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU/

It's a much improved version called AnotherLevelUp, including built-in themes
and user defined preferences sets. It is being actively developed, whereas
AnotherLevel development has ceased.

In case it's not obvious, AnotherLevelUp is actually developed by me, so I
might be a bit biased when I say I think it's excellent! :-)

OLE! OLE! BRAVO! A round of cheers for AnotherLevel.

I'm now running Red Hat 7.2

I'm sure there are more elegant  and efficient ways to do this, but I've
kept and installed these files:

fvwm2-icons-2.2.4-9
fvwm2-2.2.4-9
wmconfig-0.9.10-4
AnotherLevel-1.0.0-1

Then I copy /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/fvwm2rc.m4 to
~/.fvwm2rc.m4

I'll probably get laughs and groans, but it works for me.

Oh. And I have to remark (#) the <break> statement
in /usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM.

I too would like to know an easier way to accomplish this task.

If I want to use the original (aka 6.0) Control-Panel, I believe I
also installed the old Control-Panel and netcfg. The latest
netcfg I tried did not have PPP setup.

Some users that submitted screenshots also submitted
.fvwm2rc files.  My original position was NOT to include
.fvwm2rc files on the screenshot page.

Since then, I've had a change of heart and will now accept
them.  (Theres one there now.)

If you previously submitted a screen shot and would like to
submit an .fvwm2rc file, feel free to do so.

Try to make sure that your .fvwm2rc doesn't produce errors
and is reasonably up-to-date.

Screenshots or .fvwm2rc files can be sent to fvwm@fvwm.org
(as attachments).

I've minorly updated my RC for 2.4 (smaller/thinner?less obtrusive
widgets mostly).  I'm not quite ready to roll a new screenshot or
RC, but if there's interest, drop me a note and I'll send what I've
got.

If the command "Move" is used from a menu in a window when the
mousepointer is outside of the window and the keyboard is used to move the
window, the window stoppes when the pointer (not the window) reaches the
border of the screen.

Is is intended that the pointer is suppoed to follow the movement?
(I have sloppy focus on all windows)

Yes, this is the way it works.

If you want pointer not to disturb the movement, you may warp it first:

  AddToMenu WindowOps
  + "Move to right or bottom" MoveToRightBottom
  + "Move to left or top"     MoveToLeftTop

  DestroyFunc MoveToRightBottom
  AddToFunc   MoveToRightBottom
  + I WarpToWindow 0 0
  + I Move

  DestroyFunc MoveToLeftTop
  AddToFunc   MoveToLeftTop
  + I WarpToWindow 100 100
  + I Move

Or if you want to move a window partially outside the screen use Move from
the window borders not the window menu:

  Mouse 2 TSF A MoveOrRaiseLower

  DestroyFunc MoveOrRaiseLower
  AddToFunc   MoveOrRaiseLower
  + H Move
  + M Move
  + C RaiseLower

Mikhael.

HI

sorry it took me some time before I could try this.
I'm still trying to get the gnome panel to 'move'.
I tried to set VariablePosition. Now, when I invoke
a move command, the panel does indeed move along
with the mouse, however when I release the mouse 
button, the panel warps back to it's original position.
Also, when I try something like 

all (panel) move 0 50p

the panel for a split second moves up the screen, 
and then warps back to the original position again...

Unrelated: my panel version has "panel_window" not "panel_resource".

Most of people use "Style panel CirculateSkip", so you should use:

  Next (panel, CirculateHit) Move

This may not do what you want if there are more than one panel (or even if
there are several subpanels). Then this may be used (CirculateHit has no
effect with All):

  All (panel) Move

It took me some time to figure out why this still does not work even if
Iconify instead of Move does work. Panel sets a location hint that FVWM
respects. You should use Style option VariablePosition to ignore it.

  Style panel VariablePosition
  All (panel) Move 0 100p          # return to the bottom: Move 0 -0

Regards,
Mikhael.

Dear John, my very best congratulations for your work. I have just tried the
oldest version of
AnotherLevelUp and seems to be an excellent work. Hopefully, the newest should
be terrific.

I do work at Seville University and try to move students from <<the magic world
of Oz-gates>>
to GNU/Linux, I also find of the most interest such naive, intuitive but
so-powerful desktops and
as much different from Windows as possible.  In my opinion such minimalist
desktop makes user
feel better and free than full-of-icon Windows, KDE and Gnome desktops.

I also thank to Garv Austin and Thomas Adam for their kindly and fruitful
response. Glad to
know there is people loving AnotherLevel.


Jose Maria Martin

Aye, that's one of my requirements of my Window Manager and any of
the apps I use: no icon shall ever appear on any desktop I use.  its
amazing how much flexibility and directness comes back once you lose
that fixation.

You're welcome. And likewise for the comment. I find
AnotherLevel enhances Fvwm2 very well. If you get any
more problems do let me(us) know.

I am an fvwm95 user who is converting to fvwm2.  I am running 2.4.3 on
Solaris 7.  I ran the "setup 95" script from the root menu, then began
experimenting with my "decorations" file.

The setup 95 script gave me these ButtonStyles:

ButtonStyle     1       MiniIcon (-- flat)
ButtonStyle     all     -- UseTitleStyle Flat
AddButtonStyle  2       Pixmap mini.winXX-close.xpm
AddButtonStyle  4       Pixmap mini.winXX-maximize.xpm
AddButtonStyle  6       Pixmap mini.winXX-minimize.xpm

To keep the fvwm95 look/feel, I wanted buttons 2, 4 & 6 to be raised,
and button 1 to stay flat.  I changed the second line to:

ButtonStyle     Right   -- UseTitleStyle Raised

which worked for 2, 4 & 6 but had the side effect of raising button 1 as
well.  I eventually got what I wanted by changing the first line to:

ButtonStyle     1       MiniIcon -- UseTitleStyle Flat

Oddly, removing the parentheses from the first line is what re-flattened
button 1.  The man page mentions parentheses in the context of multiple
definitions per line, but doesn't shed light on the behavior I'm
seeing.  Can someone explain?
