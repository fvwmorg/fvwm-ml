Well, if you like wharf so much, then use it! Yes, it works w/ 2.0.45, I
checked - although I couldn't see the point of trading FvwmButtons for it...

A good Wharf conf. lines set, anyone?

Can it be distributed separately?  I could put a copy on the FTP site, or
perhaps (Chuck willing) it could become part of the distribution.  If
people find it useful, there's no reason for them to have to pull the
entire Afterstep distribution to get it.

G'day fvwm'ers, I have two quick questions. 

I'm experimenting with Win95 style title decors using fvwm2.0.45. The
window title bar left button ordering is "Minimize | Maximize | Close"
(which is the reverse of "standard" fvwm/motif-type buttons). Problem is,
some X/Motif applications only display a "Close" button [Button 6], which
is fine with standard fvwm buttons, since Button 6 = Close, but with Win95
style buttons Button 6 = "Minimize"! 

I think, fvwm95 doesn't have this problem - but I really want to stick
with fvwm2.0.45. Can I do any trickery in fvwm2 to tell it: when only one
button on the left of the title bar is being displayed, use Button 6
style/bindings instead of Button 2? 

Also with FvwmTaskBar, I'm having problems getting the "Start" button to
pop back up after clicking on it to bring up a menu.

Any ideas? (besides giving up Win95 styles!)

My users are Win95/NT4-heads and I need to make them feel "comfortable" 
when they use Unix boxes. Does anyone have experience with using
FvwmButtons or tkGoodStuff as a Win95-style TaskBar/IconTray? 

Thanks

You might also look at tkgoodstuff.  You can use background tiles, buttons can
pop-up additional button bars, button relief can be normally flat (for a sleek
look), there is a built-in task-bar, menu, pager, multi-biff, clock, multiple
logfile watcher, etc., etc., all GUI-configured.

			   Hi,

Style "*" HandleWidth x, Borderwidth y

in ~/.fvwm2rc makes both x in width. Is it possible to get fat handles
an thin borders like in olvwm anyway ?

I use colors to identify which machine a window is connected to, I do
this using styles and window titles.

What I would like to do is that when the window is active only the title
bar changes and the rest of the decoration stays the identifying color.
It seems that it should be possible using .45 but I haven't been able to
find anything that works.

I unistalled fvwm95 and TheNextLevel from my Linux workstation :-) and 
installed fvwm2.0.45.  Now when I run X no xterms or anything comes up! 
 I used a modified .fvwmrc file and it seems like fvwm2 isn't reading 
the file.  What do I do?  Also, I saw that people who istalled the Xaw95 
widgets xterm title bar looked like Win95's title bar.  How do I get 
mine like that?  You know, with the icon of the app in the upper left 
corner and the "-" and "x" in the upper right hand corner.  PLEASE HELP 
ME OUT!!!  Thanks in advance!

Doh! Should have tried before posting I guess...

I'm trying to find one, but somehow I can't get it to swallow applications
(I get just a blank button).

Hello,

I hope this isn´t a FAQ, at least I could find it in any documents
available to me. If the question is asked frequently please point me to
a source where I can find the anwer.

My problem:

I would like to know if there is a way to (temporary) disable the global
key settings for a specific application. E. g. I have bound the
following to my function keys (in ~/.fvwm2rc):

Key F1		WTSF	N	Iconify
Key F2		WTSF	N	Raise
Key F3		WTSF	N	Lower
Key F4		WTSF 	N	Maximize 0 100
Key F5		WTSF 	N	Module FvwmIdent
Key F6		WTSF 	N	Refresh
Key F7		WTSF 	N	Delete
Key F8		WTSF 	N	Destroy
Key F9		WTSF 	N	Restart fvwm2
Key F10		WTSF 	N	Stick
Key F11		WTSF 	N	Next [*] Focus
Key F12		WTSF 	N	Prev [*] Focus

Now I would like to start an application that also makes use of the
function keys. An example of such an application is Emacs. But with the
boundings above they won´t work of course. I understand that I could
modify the context from "WTSF" to "TSF", but that is not what I usually
want since I prefer to use the function keys anywhere within my windows.

If someone has an idea what I could do (Style option?), please let me
know. Thank you very much in advance.

Michael Wein

Anyone who has a configuration file for tkgoodstuff which makes it look

This is getting a little silly. There are features in Wharf that would
be wonderful additions to FvwmButtons. The "Folders" concept is one of
them, as far as I'm concerned. . Why don't we put together a list of
these features, and start porting them back into FvwmButtons? I'll at
least volunteer to coordinate patches to FvwmButtons.

That's the problem with Warf when you use it with Fvwm2...

Why only from Warf?
You can also add
 - Pixmap background (done)      (enlightment)
 - Transparent background (done) (enlightment)
 - DND support                   (Offix)
 - There are also a couple of patch/bugfix on this list which were
   never applied...

I cannot get the opaque move to work. I have the setting so that all
windows should be able to be moved opaquely however, they are still just
rubber banded.
Did I miss something in the compiling??

The first job should be to include the gradient functions in the
library, so the titlebar, icons, menu entries and some modules
(FvwmButtons...) could use it. There was a patch some days ago to
modify the icons look (fvwm -> AfterStep).

I don't see interest in coding a gradient function for each task
(icon, titlebar, fvwmbuttons...)...

Hi,
I've been a very satisfied user of Fvwm 1 for a few years.  Now I'm contem-
plating about switching to Fvwm 2 (mostly due to the improved flexibility).

However, there is one function I've been missing in Fvwm 1 and I wasn't able
to find in Fvwm 2 up to now: How can I program a hotkey for (repeated) toggling
between windows?
That means, if I select window B after having selected window A before, I'd
like the toggling function to pop me back into window A, and from there to
window B again (without having to look at the window list).  I hoped this
could be achieved by the new `Prev'-Function in Fvwm 2, but it doesn't work
for me.

Did I misinterpret the manual?  Could the kind of toggling I want be done
by an Fvwm function or would it take a new module?

As I am no subscriber of the Fvwm mailing lists, please put me on the CC
if you have any comments.

Thanks in advance,
Stefan

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I've been putting off going from 1.24r to 2.0.X for a while now
because quite a few things I'd been using didn't seem to be
implemented yet but now that most of them have appeared, I've decided
to give it a go.  Other than the fact that I liked being able to make
sticky windows a different color (too minor to get annoyed over), the
main difference that has been bothering me is the pager behavior.  I
had generally been using the built-in pager in 1.24r and it allows you
to bring windows into focus by clicking on them inside of the pager.
This is something that I use a heck of alot (I use click-to-focus for
my windows) and the module pager just doesn't seem to do it though you
can *move* a window inside of it and raise and focus it that way.
Since I didn't expect this to be addressed quickly (I'm sure people
have better things to work on right now) but since I consider it a
"must have" feature if I'm going to work with 2.0.X, I took a look at
the code and came up with some changes that seems to add this feature
so long as you stay within the same desktop (I generally use a single
desktop pager like the old built-in, anyway) and don't iconify the
pager (it won't crash the pager in those instances -- it just won't
work to focus the window).  I don't have any X programming experience
and I've only read through some of the pager code (the changes are
taken from the move code) so I'm essentially looking for someone to
comment, help, or adopt this change and incorporate it into 2.0.X.
I'm sure it could be made to work across desktops since moving does
and it might be possible to make it work for the icon and the changes
don't look that complex but since I don't know very much about X
programming, I can only guess at what needs to be done and I'm
reluctant to make more major changes blind.  The patch for my changes
appears below:

Hello,

a long time ago I asked if it is possible to move a window to the upper
right corner, i. e. perform a command "move -0p 0p". I would like to
assign that command to a title bar button. Unfortunately it seems that
nobody has a solution for this problem. Charles Hines suggested to
modify the move command accordingly but this doesn´t seem to be done so
far (Fvwm 2.0.45).

So I would like to know if someone has an idea how to simulate the
command. Thank you very much in advance.

For me, clicking with MB2 in the pager already does just this.

You may have to change the file name to .fvwm2rc.

To get the "mini-icon" at the upper left conner.
  First you have to have something similar to this in your .fvwm2rc
	Style	"emacs*"	MiniIcon mini-edit.xpm,Icon emacs.xpm
  Then put
	ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon		
   and you have to comment out the old ButtonStyle for button 1.

I haven't done this before but you can use pixmap for each button style.
Read the "fvwm2" manual for details.

The 1.24r built-in pager behavior is a bit different, though.  It both
brings the window into focus AND switches to the appropriate page.
I'm essentially trying to combine the two behaviors into a single
left-button operation (the 1.24r behavior I'm used to).  Since the
middle button behavior is essentially what I want added, the full fix
should simply be to copy enough of the MB2 code into the right places
but I lack sufficent knowledge of X to know what I really have to 
move beyond what I've done already.  All of my experiments to take 
this further have failed to one degree or another but what I sent 
seems stable.

I have just loaded XFree86 3.2 and am using fvwm (version 1 something).
>From what I have read, version 2 is different from 1 in file configuration,
etc.  Since I am new to this, should I go ahead and get/install version 2.
If so, could someone tell me how to install it (I installed XFree86 3.2 by
following the how-to.  it was well written and provided no surprises)?

My configuration includes Red Hat Linux 4.0 on a Pentinum 166 with 32mb RAM,
a 2G hard drive and a Diamond 2000 3D w/ 4mb RAM.

Any advice would be appreciated.

It's not possible in stock fvwm2 -- however, I've patched .43 to do it
(since I use frame colors for the same purpose!). I've not had a chance
to upgrade to .45 though.  My 2.0.43-based patch is attached below --
perhaps you can adapt it to .45 (shouldn't be hard).  I'd really like to
see this get adopted into the baseline release...

Hi,

I have 2 questions

1) How do I configure FvwmPager to display both  mini-icons and small
font title? It seems to be able to do just either one of them.

2) I have FvwmIconMan 0.9.7. (If it possible, )How do I configure it to
have one manager manage emacs windows of that page and another manager
manage emacs windows in all other pages/desks?

Thanks

About a month ago I wrote such a patch, posted it, and placed it on my 
home page. 5 people visited. 1 responded. I decided the people didn't 
want or care about the NextStep look. (and yes I put the code in the lib 
subdirectory I even was nice with #ifdefs and all.) 

All the interest now. Go figure.

I made some changes to my .fvwm2rc file recently and now no longer see the
window interactively change size.. Or when I place a new window, I only
see the top left 'L'-bracket, but not the general outline of the window
size. What did I do and how to undo that?

Howdy folks, I'm re-mailing my original mailer since I haven't gotten any
responses and I'm still at a loss to find answers.

ANY feedback would be greatly appreciated..


Date: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 15:59:40 -0800 (PST)
To: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

1. Could someone please explain how 'Restart fvwm2' works.
    I've noticed that even if I _delete_ my executable file (fvwm) while fvwm
    is running and Restart, it will restart without a hitch (shouldn't it 
    re-read the binaries again in case they've changed ?).  I came across 
    this when I modified one of the files (functions.c) and included some 
    printf's which never showed up (via restarts) until I killed the process 
    and command-line started fvwm.

2. MouseFocus vs. ClickToFocus:
    From my adventures into seeing why a certain feature does not work for me, 
    I've come to believe that ClickToFocus and MouseFocus function quite 
    differently internal to fvwm (in terms of including windows in the
    Window-list structure of last focused things).  In other words, if you
    have 4 windows on your current page and you have ClickToFocus enabled
    and you circulated around them, then the focused list would be 1->2->3->4
    (Scr.Focus - next - prev); if, on the word hand, you have MouseFocus then
    the list would _not_ be 1->2->3->4 even though you went through the same
    focusing procedure (ie. you circulated through the same windows).  I
    haven't been able to determine how MouseFocus'ed windows are included 
    into that list/structure.
 
Any ideas ?

Many Thanks in advance,

 - Nadim

The line

   Key F22         A       N       Prev [CurrentPage] FlipFocus

/should/ do what you want, but there have been many reports from
people for whom it did not work. Originally, I experienced similar
problems, but I could finally work around them by playing with the
style options for some of my applications. It seems, that the style
options for the window list module was causing (at least part of) the
problems. This is, what works for me, YMMV:

   Style "Fvwm*"        NoTitle,          Sticky,WindowListSkip,CirculateSkip
   Style "FvwmConsole"  Title,  Handles,  Slippery,WindowListHit,CirculateHit
   Style "FvwmBanner"   StaysOnTop
   Style "FvwmButtons"  NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0,ClickToFocus,CirculateSkip
   Style "FvwmWinList"  NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0,ClickToFocus,CirculateSkip

You might have to do some playing-around with options, until
everything works properly. I found it useful, to replace "FlipFocus"
with "Focus" while debugging my ".fvwmrc" file.

Not sure exactly what you want. Do you want one manager to show the emacs
windows on the current page, and the second to show all the rest, and as you
switch pages they get updated correspondingly? It can't do that. That would be
cool though. There's a simple change that would make that work, but I'll have
to think about the ramifications of it.

If you have one special page that contains emacs windows that need their own
manager, and this page doesn't change, that would work.

Simplest way is if you could have the first emacs set the icon string to
contain some special string, and then have a manager set to catch all windows
whose icon names contain that string. You can then set the format option to
something like "%t" so it displays the title string and not the icon. Since
these emacs windows seem special (or why else have them in their own manager"
it might work.

Example, make those emacs windows' icon names contain "bubba" and use this:

*FvwmIconMan*1*format "%t"
*FvwmIconMan*1*resolution global
*FvwmIconMan*1*show icon=*bubba*

*FvwmIconMan*2*format "%t"
*FvwmIconMan*2*resolution global
*FvwmIconMan*2*show resource=emacs resource=gemacs


Manager 1 catches the special emacs's and #2 gets all the rest.

Hello,

I noticed that the color of the guiding lines displayed when resizing a
window have changed from Fvwm 2.0.42 to 2.0.45. Could someone please
give me a hint where I can change the color? I studied the manpage now
for more than an hour but still don´t know how. Thanks a lot in advance.

Hi,

Yesterday I stumbled accross a problem with FVWM. My first thought was
that I make a mistake in my application but now I see that FVWM just
handles modal dialogs differently than mwm and dtwm.

I got three windows:

        -------------------------------------------
        ! Main Window                             !
        !                                         !
        !  -------------------------------------  !
        !  ! Dialog Window                     !  !
        !  !  ------------------------------   !  !
        !  !  ! Sub Dialog Window          !   !  !
        !  !  !                            !   !  !
        !  !  !                            !   !  !
        !  !  !                            !   !  !
        !  !  ------------------------------   !  !
        !  !-----------------------------------!  !
        -------------------------------------------

I have the window hierarchy constructed like this:

       Main Window -> Dialog Window -> Sub Dialog Window

All Dialog Windows have XmDIALOG_FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL set.

Now  what I get with FVWM 2.0.44 is this: When all Windows are managed and
I click on the Main Window, the "Sub Dialog" window disappears. However
the "Dialog Window" stays on top. 

This is *NOT* how it is supposed to work. Both dialog windows should
stay on top when I click on the Main Window. This works with both, Mwm
and Dtwm and I consider this a bug in FVWM. Or is there some fvwm2 setting
which can make it resemble the behaviour of Mwm in this respect.

Thanks a lot -- Tom

Hi there!

I've been reading the doc forwards and backwards, and havent found a solution
for my problem(Am I blind, or what?)

My problem is:

I have set up two desktops viewed with the FvwmPager. I use FvwmBacker because
I'd like to have different background for each desktop. Now my problem, which
is the movement. It's easy to use the mouse, but I want to move it with
the keyboard. Simple, I though and added:

Key Left A C Desk -1 0
Key Right A C Desk 1 0

but the problem is that it moves beyond my pager view. Ie. It shows Desk 2,
but the pager view is from 0 to 3. I have looked in the manpages but cant
find how I can limit the the moving range?

Help!

Would some kind soul out there, especially one who has done some work on it, be prepared to code up a script or a module that would turn present style settings to a Decor

The Decor feature seems really powerful and very nice, especailly on a large site, however I'm still getting problems trying to recreate my current setup.

could someone help please. 
it would make Decors catch on quicker and allow the spread on various desktop looks

I just wanted to add my voice to those who are wishing for, and voice
support to those who are working on: a Gradient MenuStyle.

My desktop would look REALLY appealing and CONSISTENT if my menus could
have a similar color and gradience as my titlebars.

Cheers,
Eric.

Well... the only thing I'd like to ask for (aside from gradients in
menu-style), would be for an extra type of gradient. In addition to
VGradient and HGradient (Vertical and Horizontal), it'd be cool to have a
DGradient (Diaganol (sp?))... Which would take flags as directions... Or
maybe just make one gradient style where the first argument is the
direction, i.e.:

	instead of
	HGradient 16 3 Red 20 White 30 Blue 50 Grey

	you could have
	Gradient North 16 2 Red 50 White 50 Grey

where North could be interchangeable with North, South, East, West,
North-East... etc... or the single letter equivalents... N, S, E, W, NE, 
NW, SE, SW ... etc... It might make things a bit easier... but I don't
know how easy it'd be to code that (mostly cuz I can't code worth-a-crap).
Just a suggestion though... It might actually make more sense that way to
a .fvwm2rc newcomer...

Thanks - I tried it and it works - sometimes.  If it works, it works
fine: I can toggle ad infinitum between the two selected windows with
a single keystroke.
But mostly, nothing happens at all - the text cursor in Xterm windows
is blanked out for a moment (as if the window would loose focus, but
no other window gets the focus instead.  What's worse, toggling to
another window never works if the window which had the focus previously
is iconified.
Also, it isn't clear to me why I have to use `Prev [*] FlipFocus' in-
stead of just `FlipFocus'?

As Fvwm clearly has some idea of which window had the focus previously,
I think there should be a possibility to choose that window again.
Is the current behavior of FlipFocus a bit buggy or would some kind
of extension be necessary (e.g. a builtin function PreviousWindowID
returning the id of the former selected window?

In my experience, the styles I specify don't have any effect.

I've been running fvwm2 for awhile now, and have yet to figure this one
out. Someone wanna clue me in on how to get the windowshade feature to
work?

Thanks...

If we are to be general then N should be a macro for a 
vector direction. I don't want my gradients to be limited 
to a specific set of directions.

Ian's Suggestion:

Gradient [x,y] 16 2 Red 50 White 50 Grey

A make this suggestion also becuase based on the current 
gradient algorithms this is a trivial way to code it. I.e. 
you are given a direction and you then draw shaded lines 
orthogonal to that direction (or trapazoides if one is 
clever).

This had me scratching my head for a while.  I copied "decor_examples"
into my .fvwm2rc and tried switching  back and forth between 2 decors.
I then noticed  that the upper-right handle  seemed  to have too  many
divisions in it, and some of the other handles were missing.

I finally tracked down the problem.  In the following function, buttons
0 thru 9 are removed:

AddToFunc	"RemoveAllButtons"
+ "I"	Style "*"	NoButton 0, NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 3, \
			NoButton 4, NoButton 5, NoButton 6, NoButton 7, \
			NoButton 8, NoButton 9

The problem is, there are only 8 buttons, 1 thru 8.

The style parsing code doesn't enforce any range  checks on either the
"button" or "nobutton" args, and random bits are flipped.

I   think  it might  be a   good  idea to  fix   the  parsing, and the
"decor_examples" file.

Thanks,

I posted a simple patch for the NoButton 0 problem a while back.  You
should be able to search for it.

That's exactly what I want. I guess I have to wait till the next version
then (if you decide to include this feature).

is there a simple way (in fvwm-2.0.45) to change the pointer cursor to
have a SW-NE orientation instead of SE-NW?

i was recently advised to switch the mouse to my left hand, and i find
it a bit awkward to use the default cursor orientation.

thanks.

Speaking as a physicist:
this is totally unnecessary. Once you can add a gradient in some 
direction, by combining several commands in orthogonal directions, s->e
and w->e, say, you can make up any direction you want.

However, if it doesn't make any difference in the code, this equivalence 
might be ignored.

Hello all!

 this is my first post to this list (even before i've gotten a reply from
your majordomo :)

 i've done some (minor -- 20 lines or less) changes to some of the FVWM
code, specifically, FVWM itself and the FvwmWinList module. it's really
trivial: i didn't like the way FVWM was handling "too-long" window titles,
so i added some code so that it would clip the title at a string boundary.
i also did this with FvwmWinList (which i use instead of hunting for nifty
icons for all my apps :)

 there's a screenshot of what my tiny mods look like:
  http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/linux-desktop.jpg

 (although for this shot, i'd only done the thing for the FvwmWinList, not
the window titles)

 that was to 2.0.43, i'm not certain if it's been done with 2.0.45. what's
required to join the contributors (or something?) i must disclaim: i'm NOT
an expert X programmer although i'm pretty experienced at unix programming
in general. another thing i want to hack is FvwmAudio. i'm not sure about
the rest of you but both fvwm-2.0.43 and fvwm95-2.0.42 exhibit this bug --
FvwmAudio immediately dumps core on startup (using Linux). i also want to
add native support for Linux audio devices..

In this case... why even confuse things with an x and y ... why not just
make everything alot easier and specify a degree angle. For example:

Gradient [degree angle] 16 2 Red 50 White 50 Grey

where 90 would be a North type direction, 180 = West, 270 = South, 0 -
East ... and then you have everything in between... (and then negative
degree angles, and degree angles greater than or equal to 360, etc :)

Hello.  I'm a newbie and not quite sure if this is the right place to ask
this question, so please no flames. 

I'm running fvwm95-2.0.42a-5 and would like to be able to set the
background (border) colour on my button bar to a separate colour than is
specified by the DefalutColors winbackcolor variable:

DefaultColors   Black grey50 #c0c0c0 grey60

I've tried specifying it using the Style tool, thus:

Style "FvwmButtons"  NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky,\
                     WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 5, BackColor Grey10

But I still get the same background colour as the titlebar and borders of
my unselected windows (actually the borders of all the windows are the
default color).

I can't believe that it is impossible to set the colour of the button bar
separately.  Any help would be appreciated, and should probably be
mailed directly to myself.

I noticed that one of the modules listed in my modules popup is
FvwmConfig.  I tried running this, but my console tells me that there is
no such module.

Is this a configuration utility?  ie. some sort of GUI-driven or
menu-selected configurator?

How can I obtain it?  I assume it must exist, since I didn't write the
default setup, and it was there in my .fvwm2rc95.

About my previous question:

In the same vein I'd like to find out if it is possible to set the Popup
menu background to something other than the window border colour.

Well the thing to do is hack the source code  :)
It's easy if you know how.. not to mention trivial..
You can even add your own FvwmBazFoo entries which get parsed along with
everything else...

I just took a look and your patch is *almost* what I want. While I like
the gradiented background for the icons, one thing I hate about afterstep
is that there is no text associated with the icons. When I have 5 iconified
shells, I like to be able to select the right one based upon the title.

Anyone who knows enough about the fvwm internals to come up with such a
mixed style?

Becuase people seemed disinteredted in my patches I stopped posting them. 
I have infact made that change in the version of fvwm I an running. In my 
version text is default, and for no text the NoIconTitle keyword (or 
something reasonably like it) is used. Also the code is cleaner.

I have placed a "snapshot" of my current fvwm source tree at 
ftp://hepserver.nhn.ou.edu/pub. I don't have a copy of standard fvwm any 
more, and being lazy I didn't want to get one just to produce a .diff file.

Ian

I'm new to fvwm so if this is a stupid question, pardon me.  I was wondering
if you can place an icon on a form.  Is it possible and how?

You should check out 'FvwmScript' that is in the 'extras' directory that
is part of the fvwm-2.0.45 distribution. It is an outstanding replacement for
'FvwmForm'... its only downside is that it needs an external script to
define what it is supposed to do; there is no way to embed it in your .fvwm2rc
file like you can with FvwmForm. Other than that, its feature and "look and
feel" are much better than "its competitor".

This assumes, of course, that you build and install fvwm yourself; if not,
you may be out of luck, unless you have a nice sysadmin who will build and
install it for you... :-)

Just my $0.02,
Eddy

Thanks, James, but I already knew about those settings.  They alter the
text color and the color of the tile, but not the window border, which is
what I'm trying to set.

Same here.  I hadn't noticed it 'til you mentioned it, but now
it bothers me too!  I'd sure use such a feature!  Does it exist?

Window border of fvwmbuttons window.

Style "FvwmButtons"     Color   sienna/purple

Just like the window border of all the other windows.  ;)

Is there a way to specify no titles in the button bar?  I've tried
'NoTitle', not specifying a title, and 'Title "" ', but they all give an
error.  At the moment, I don't specify a title argument, and I get
(predictably) this error:

FvwmButtons: Missing title argument

Not a world-ender of a problem, I know, but I like to keep the list of
errors on my xconsole to a minimum...

After a quick look at the code, I found that there is no configuration
option to change cursors.  It seems that you have to change the code at
roughly line 717 of fvwm.c, in function CreateCursors (fvwm version
2.0.43).  In your case, we'd want to change the line:

Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_top_left_arrow);

to:

Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_arrow);

I'll see if I can whip up a patch for a configuration option for
cursors.  It should be pretty simple.

Hmm, before you do read the attached note from Tom Julien. The
feature might already exist, though I haven't tried it yet and I could
find no documentation for the Cursor keyword.

I'm not sure I understand the above exactly, but you can set
the cursor for the root window to be any cursor listed in
X11/cursorfont.h (drop the XC_ prefix) or an xbm image with
xsetroot.  For example, if you wanted an arrow with a SW-NE
orientation, you could add the following to your .xinitrc:

	xsetroot -cursor_name arrow

You can also do this for the different window cursors that
are used with fvwm via the Cursor command in your .fvwmrc.
For example,

	Cursor 6 2

will give you a SW-NE arrow for the cursor used in the menus.

Hope this helps.

I got excited seeing this, so I tried this right away. Sad to say, it
works for some things but not all. For example, right now I'm using
emacs to compose this note. When I move the cursor up to the pull down
menus, i get the usual cursor. When I select the menu item, It
switches to the left-handed one. FvwmButtons, FvwmPager and
FvwmIconBox all continue to use the right hand cursor. I think I would
prefer consistency to switching and a consistent LH one would be the
winner.

Does Chris's patch provide for that consistency?

Folks,

We're not talking about the Xserver's cursor (the one you can change
with xsetroot <blah, blah, blah> that you see on the "root" window.

We're talking about FVWM's cursor...the one you see if you place your
pointer on the FvwmButtons Bar, or on the title bar of an open window.

It's that little arrow-pointing-up-and-left.  
A lefty-cursor would point up-and-right, instead.

At least that's what I was referring to when I said I could use such
a feature.  (FVWM _may_ have other cursors, too, but this is the one
I thought we meant.)

As mentioned to Mark, fvwm-1.x has the capability with the
"Cursor" directive, but I wasn't sure about it's availability
under 2.x.  Under 1.x, there isn't just one "FVWM cursor",
there are different cursors for various window attributes and
menus that are under fvwm control.

XC_top_left_arrow

XC_arrow

There are a number of factors here.  X clients can set or
accept cursor settings outside the control of the window
manager.  For example, a common way to override a default
cursor for a particular widget within a client is with an
X resource of the form:

*cursorName: arrow

Mark's particular issue seemed to be with netscape and FvwmPager.

It seems people are taking about all cursors, netscapes's, fvwm's and the
root window's.  

There isn't any way in fvwm2 to change any of fvwm's curors.  When I wanted a
different cursor for my title bar buttons I had to change the code in the
function CreateCursors in fvwm.c.  It would seem like a good idea, and
something twm and maybe fvwm1 do, to let the user specify the cursors to
use.o
Right now there is just a bunch of lines like:
  Scr.FvwmCursors[DEFAULT] = XCreateFontCursor(dpy, XC_top_left_arrow);

It should be possible to change the XC_top_left_arrow to something else.


Of course this doesn't solve the problem that fvwm's cursors don't effect
netscape, or xterm, or any other program.  So if you want to mirror all the
arrows you either have to reconfigure every program (which is easier than
it sounds because many programs would be reconfigured by changing one
resource), or change the cursor font.  Changing the cursor font is kind of
a kludge, but would be easiest.

OK, I started a lot of discussion here, but I figure the end issue is
changing the Fvwm cursors.

I just wrote a patch that adds simple cursor configurability to fvwm
with a CursorConfig command.  The patch is against 2.0.43, so it
may be slightly outdated, but it should probably patch fine.

Side note to Chuck:  could you add this, or something similar, to the
distribution?  BTW, I wrote it before I got your message with the
previous patch, so it's not based on it.  It also doesn't do a refresh
of all windows, but that might be a good thing, since you might want
windows to retain their old cursors, i.e.:

AddToFunc Foo
+ I CursorConfig title_cursor arrow
+ I Exec foo
+ I Wait foo
+ I CursorConfig title_cursor gumby

Though that might not be too useful.  Really, the two patches look
almost the same, other than that, and the fact that mine used lookup
tables as opposed to if .. else's.

I neglected to write any docs (sorry) but the syntax is:

CursorConfig <which cursor> <X11 cursor name>

where <which cursor> is one of the names in screen.h (not case
sensitive):  position, title_cursor, default, sys, move, wait, menu,
select, destroy, top, right, bottom, left, top_left, top_right,
bottom_left, or bottom_right.  <X11 cursor name> is one of the names in
<X11/cursorfont.h>, minus the "XC_".

(Patch follows signature.  Note: patch -p2 from the distribution root
is the way to go.)

fvwm1 does allow this.  Snag 1.24r, and check out the man page
and source for a start.

Yes. And for me, the end result is worth it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't apply cleanly to 2.0.45; apparently there
was some code reorganization, and 3 out of 4 hunks failed. But it was
fairly trivial to hand apply, and I updated the patch to 2.0.45
(attached). It applies to vanilla fvwm-2.0.45 using `patch
-p1'. Sorry, I didn't add any documentation, either, though.

FvwmScript 3.0 is distributed with fvwm2.0.45, but I just found that
FvwmScript 3.1 (last updated Feb 18th 1997) is available. The page is
written in French, the link to the distribution is at the bottom of the
page with the anchor text "ici" - which I guess is French for "here" :-)

A question...

I've just stumbled across TkDesk
(http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk/).  I haven't
started playing with it yet, but, has anyone had problems integrating this
with tkGoodStuff and Fvwm2? I think, I just want to use the Filer and
other apps but want to stick with the tkGoodStuff application/taskbar. 
Does anyone have experiences with tkDesk?

I made a diff file using your snapshot and used it succesfully to patch
my source tree. It's precisely what I wanted :^), thanks!. Should I make it
available somewhere or send it to you?

The only things I still need now are:
- gradiented menus
- a way to give different backgrounds for wharf folders vs. wharf buttons
- maybe an updated FvwmButtons so that I don't need wharf anymore?

Cheers,

I think it should be cool to put the diff somewhere, or at least post
it here, so people like me can use the patch too :).
I read that the guys from AS modified the code of gradients because
of a memory leak...

Is there a way to change dynamically the back color in FvwmButtons ?
I tried the DestroyModuleConfig command to remove the 'FvwmButtonsBack'
definition, and it works fine but I didn't succeed in adding a new one,
whereas I've got no problem with FvwmForm !
Any idea ?

Thanks,

Christian

Search the man page for "XORValue" for how to change this.  You'll
have to experiment.

[about changing the mouse1 ( mouse2 ? ) action in FvwmPager]

pleas make it

*FvwwmPagerMouse1Click	any_function

and use SendInfo()

SendInfo(fd,fn,win);

fd is the pipe back to fvwm2,
fn is any fvwm2 command (read from .fvwm2rc)
win is the selected window.

If you want to make it really clean, you can make all the following
possibilities:

*FvwmPagerMouse[123](click|move|doubleclick) anyfunction

I'm having trouble making the fvwm Version 2.0.45 under Soalris 2.5.1

Has anyone done this that might be able to give me a hand?

In the Fvwm.tmpl I have defined InstallLibs to No (see below)

	#define InstallLibs NO

Heres the error message I'm stuck on.

	make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target `../libs/libfvwm2.a'
	Current working directory /home/jamesl/fvwm/fvwm-2.0.45/fvwm
	*** Error code 1

Thanks.

Did you make sure you built a  "Makefile" in _all_ the subdirectories?

Sounds to me like maybe there isn't one at all in ../libs/Makefile
Thus, you get "Don't know how to make target..." errors in that
directory.

after upgrading from fvwm2-2.0.43 to 2.0.45, the windows that are larger than 
OpaqueMoveSize do not show the outline when I move them (things are fine for 
windows smaller than OpaqueMoveSize)... is there an additional setting to use 
in .fvwm2rc? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

I use the redhat contributed rpm for both version (RedHat 4.1)

I have a similar setup, hope I can help.

It doesn't look  like it's trying to install  the lib, its in the fvwm
subdirectory trying to install fvwm.  Before it can  do this, it knows
that  the  library must already    be built in a  parallel  directory:
../lib/libfvwm2.a.

Check that  the lib is there.   If not, retry  your  make from the top
level directory, and make sure that  the make in  the lib directory is
working.  (Ie. creating libfvwm2.a.)

I'm embarrassed to ask this, but I can't figure out what I did wrong
and can't find the answer in any archives.

I installed fvwm 2.0.45 from scratch today, on a new machine.
Everything went fine, except that my mini-icons aren't showing up in
my pop-up menus.  Instead, I se

	Calculator%mini-calc.xpm%

and so on.  I have /usr/local/icons and /usr/local/mini-icons both
containing the icons that came with the distribution, and added these
into the FvwmIconPath in Fvwm.tmpl (where I also define HasXpm YES,
which is true).
 
In my .fvwm2rc, My IconPath and PixmapPath incude these two
directories, but still, I get letters instead of icons.  What am I
missing?  On my home machine, I'd gone from fvwm -> early fvwm2 ->
fvwm-95 -> fvwm-2.0.45, and when I put on fvwm-95, the mini-icons
appeared and stayed after the switch to fvwm2, and I don't recall
doing anything special.

Thanks,

Bill

a quick question about something i was just thinking of....

does anyone know of a program or maybe this could be made part of fvwm,
that would recognize hot spots on the screen?  basically, i'd like to be
able to simply move the pointer to, say, the upper right hand corner of
the screen and have my screensaver startup.  basically, link a hotspot
with a user specified app, so i could make one corner "xlock -nolock"
and another simply "xlock".

anyway, just wondering if anyone's thought of this or has it or is
working on it....

You mention xlock in your description.  As a matter of fact, the
program 'xautolock' has at least some of the functionality you're
talking about (maybe more that I remember).  I recall you can specify
for xautolock to never initiate xlock if you have your pointer in 
a "safe" corner, and I think you can specify another corner so that if
the pointer is there, xautolock "immediately" invokes xlock.  I
confess, I didn't really play around with it all that much.

xautolock may not offer the flexibility you have in mind, (as I recall,
only the four corners can be specified, with user-specified "size")
but it might be a place to start, if one were inclined to build on the
idea.

There's a program called xautolock that starts any program after a given
amount of idle time, or when the mouse is moved over a certain corner of
the screen.  It is available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/ or any of its
mirrors.

Also, there is another one out there called xlockmore, but I don't have
any experience with that one.

Subject: FVWM: Action from a swallowed button
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I want to swallow an application into a button, but still have that button
launch another application if it is clicked on.  I was under the impression
that that can be done, however it doesn't work for me.  This is an example of
what I am trying to do:

*FvwmButtons (2x1, Swallow "perfmeter"
  'Exec nice -16 perfmeter -g -S -t cpu -t colls -H -bg 908090 -fg navy',
  Action 'Exec "XTerm" xterm -title top -e /usr/local/bin/top&')

Am I trying to do something that can't be done, or am I going about it the
wrong way?

Recently upgraded fvwm from 1.24 to 2.0.43.  Now whenever something odd
happens that has to do with windows, guess who gets beat up!  Are there
any fvwm - xscreensaver interaction issues?  Users swear that windows
now come through the screensaver and did not before the upgrade.

Hello:

  I'm using FvwmWinList as a (sort of) icon manager. I use NoIcon so that
them icky pixmaps don't appear, they just become a list in FvwmWinList.
Now I set the minimum width == the maximum width so it only resizes
vertically. Now the bad habit is that, the FvwmWinList has a tendency to
wander downward and to the right after it resizes. I'm using 2.0.43; is
this documented bug behavior?

  (I realize this is dumb); I'm actually using a modified FvwmWinList, but
the modification is trivial -- I added some XTextWidth(...) code in
make_name() so that the window names get clipped at character boundaries
instead of getting clipped at the edge of the module window (which looks
messy). Maybe this causes the module drifting?

Well, yes and no.  TO the best of my knowledge you CAN do what you are
doing, but you have to click on an area of the button that doesn't
belong to the client program. . .ie. run a shaped program and click on
the "background".

It would be nice, however, to tell fvwm buttons to intercept those events
and use them for Actions.  This just isn't possible right now.

I experienced a similar error on my system (HP-UX 10.10) when I
compiled fvwm2-2.0.45 with gcc -O2.  Switching to HP-UX's native c
compiler and removing all optimizations made the problem go away for
me.

I've seen that before when I used some exotic gcc optimization options.
Try compiling it with no optimization at all and see if it works then. After
that, you can always check which particular optimization is causing the
problem.

I whipped up a really simple patch that might improve the behavior of
"FlipFocus" when used in mouse-focus mode. I have done *very* little
testing and it is quite possible that this patch breaks some other
functionality. First impressions suggest, that the new behavior is
more correct than the old one. As I do not fully understand FVWM's
internal handling of window lists, I would very much appreciate if
somebody else took a close look at this fix and checks that it takes
the right approach.

I am uncertain, whether FvwmButton currently supports this feature. If
you cannot get it to work, you could always code it yourself. The
modifications to "perfmeter" should be very simple.

For example code, have a look at my program at
ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/isnd4linux/contributions/isdnbutton-2.5.tar.gz
(actually, the archive might still reside in ftp://ftp.franken.de/incoming).
This program displays some status information and allows to launch
other programs when you click in the window. It even has a pop-up menu
to select between different programs. The code is not very large and
should serve as a good basis to get started. My code is highly
configurable thru the use of application resources.

Good luck,


Markus

What you want can be done, but not quite as nicely as you want.  This
has come up before, and my solution was to add an empty title to the
swallowed button.  ISTR someone else saying that the padding feature
can be used the same way.  If you do one of these things, then
clicking on the title, or in the pad area (eg outside the application
window itself) then you get the FvwmButton action you want.  Here is
an example of what I do

*FvwmButtons(10x1, Frame 1, Action `Exec "top" TOP`, \
    Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) XMeter "Exec XMETER", \
    Font SCHU_C_M_R_N_6, Title " ")

So I have a button defined whose default action is to run the top
command (please forgive me for not expanding my M4 macros here).  That
will be run if I click with the mouse button in the title area or if
FvwmButtons has focus and the mouse is positioned in that button, then
hitting RET will cause the action to take place.  In that case, it
doesn't matter where the mouse is in the button.  The Font is an M4
macro for the smallest font I could find on my system so the empty
title takes as little space as possible.  I prefer this to padding
which pads the entire button.  If I click the mouse in the xmeter
title bar, I get the xmeter menu of what stats to display, so in a way
this is the best of both worlds for me anyway.  That said, I'd much
prefer if FvwmButtons allowed me to intercept mouse clicks in
swallowed window buttons in general.  Note also the title is a single
space.  When I tried to use the empty string, FvwmButtons complained.

hth,

Is it smaller than 'nil2'? 'nil2' is pretty darn small. :-)

Not many people know about that font, which is why I thought I'd mention it.
(and it is short enough to not require an M4 macro... bonus!)

I know little about the internals of FvwmWinList, but I wrote FvwmIconMan
which is very similar and is sometimes plagued with the same problem. 

Quick question: do you have your FvwmWinList set up so that it grows to the
left or up? That is, is the corner which is fixed (assuming the wandering
wasn't happening) any other that the top left corner? If so, then this
operation is impossible to do in X without occasional wandering. The best you
can do is minimize the risk of its occurance, which I've been trying to do for
two years in FvwmIconMan.

It's very unlikely that your change affected anything. 

By the way, the url for FvwmIconMan is:
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software

The screenshots on the page will probably only look nice if you have a >= 16
bpp display or are running ANY webbrowser other than netscape. I don't know
who wrote netscape's colormap quantization code, but they suck.

What do you people use to edit xpm's (icons, textures, ...)? Currently
I use gimp but doesn't know how to save them, so I have to save them
as tiff's, then use XV to convert them, then use a text editor to
change one of the colours to transparent.

Surely there must be an easier option, not?

BTW: I'm using an SGI Indigo2, so solutions should either come as SGI
native code or source code.

Strange as it may seem... "not" is the right answer.

You could use pixmap  or xpaint  to  paint your icons, but  it doesn't
have the power of gimp.

Thanks!  It looks much better now, though I do have to be a bit more
careful about where I put the cursor -- it looks like nil2 give me
about 2 pixels.

Hi All,

I believe I have found a new 16 bpp bug in fvwm2.0.45...

When I run fvwm2 with 16 bpp and resize with windows (grabbing the "L" at
the corner of the window), the outlined size of the new window does
not appear. The window does resize correctly.

This is not a problem when I run a 8 bpp.

(I am have a S3 Trio 64+ based card, if that matters)

Cheers

XEmacs has a mode for editing XPM's. It is actually very nice and even
gives you a preview of the image. You will have to add these lines to
your "~/.emacs" file:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.xpm\\(\\.orig\\)?$"  . xpm-mode))
	      auto-mode-alist))

This mode is not suited for editing *huge* XPM's, but for normal sized
ones, it works very nicely.

Hi all...
	I remember some time ago, there was a call for interesting
configurations of fvwm2. Well, I've got one... and I'd like some input.
Take a gander at:

	http://www.fiu.edu/~kvarga01/cde/CD-fvwm2.html

Please keep in mind that the gradients don't look half as good in a .gif
as they do on my monitor... and also... if you can hardly see the
gradient, or if the icons n' stuff look too dark... turn up your
brightness... My idea was to look like a CD-Player... I hope I did it :)
			-peace

I use pixmap which is available as source code. It's neat; it makes it
easy for you to center pixmaps, etc, and even to make them transparent --
just select the transparent color and floodfill.

Pixmap works just like bitmap (which you should have) and can use either
Athena widgets, or, since you're using an SGI, the Motif widgets, which
makes it look way cool.. :)

The only thing missing from pixmap (although there might be a command, I'm
no expert) is some cropping function and how to resize pixmaps.

Hello:

  This is to (yell about) my latest programming project, FvwmCDE. I'm
working on a replacement for the CDE front panel that works with Fvwm. The
current version is pre-alpha (i.e. it doesn't work). You can take a look
at my preliminary work at:

  http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/FvwmCDE/

  There's more information on that page, but to be quick: FvwmCDE is not
runtime customizable (i.e. drag icons to its applist and they get added to
the list automagically). All FvwmCDE customizations are in the .fvwm2rc
file, just like a good module should  :)

  I'm not an FVWM worker or anything, so this isn't official. If you like
what you see there, I'll have a functional release in a few days, so check
back on the page listed above then.

  Cheers!

Twiddle the XORValue.  From my .fvwmrc (for 8bpp):

    XORValue 12

fvwm-2.0.45, FvwmIconMan-0.9.7:  anyone else experiencing the following?

have FvwmIconMan configured horizontally (to act similar to TaskBar in
fvwm95), with fixed geometry.  far right 20 or 25 pixels appear to be
cut off (i.e., root window shows through).  relevant configuration is
attached.

other than that, it appears to work quite nicely (thanks, Brady!).

since Chris Laas and Mark Borges managed to get a working CursorConfig
patch for fvwm-2.0.45 (something i've been waiting for---been doing a
quick-and-dirty hack until now), i went ahead and generated a patch for
the fvwm2 man page (below).  apply with 'patch -p1' from the fvwm-2.0.45
source directory.

Chuck, please add this along with the patch from Mark's earlier message
to the list.

FvwmIconMan-0.9.7 compiles under fvwm-2.0.45 on Linux (kernel 2.0.27,
gcc-2.7.2.1) with warnings that functions stripcpy() and GetNextToken()
in readconfig.c are declared static after being declared non-static. 
this is because stripcpy() in FvwmIconMan is the same function (only
static) as in fvwm-2.0.45/libs/Strings.c, and GetNextToken() conflicts
with a function of the same name in fvwm-2.0.45/libs/Parse.c.  the
patch below comments out the definition of stripcpy in
.../FvwmIconMan/readconfig.c and renames FvwmIconMan's version of
GetNextToken() to GetNextCommaToken().  compiles with no warnings.

You're going to love this (or maybe not). With a screen size of 1024x768 you
will have exactly 24 pixels left over, since the FvwmIconMan that you have is
limited to a max width of 1000 pixels. It was left over from when FvwmIconMan
could only be one column, and then 1000 seemed like a fine limitation. I
haven't released another version since then, but since you've already been
editing the code, you should change line 718 of x.c from:

 sizehints.max_width = 1000;
to
 sizehints.max_width = globals.screenx;

There you go. I'll release a 0.9.7a which has this soon.

Thankyou to everyone who has helped with this question.  I know where I stand
now and have managed to get it to work.

For a future version: it would be good if a button with a swallowed 
application could grab the cursor input IFF an action is defined for that
button.

Hi all,

I think that MouseFocusClickRaises is the best thing since sliced
bread :-).  And I think that it could be made even better if there was a
new option MouseFocusRaiseClickDoesntPassClick or something,
analogously to ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick.

Ie if I click into a window in MouseFocus or SloppyFocus mode said
window is raised but the click isn't passed to the window.

Whatcha think?

Hi,

I am new to this list, so forgive me if something like this has already
been asked. I have just switched from tvtwm to fvwm and am trying to use
the FvwmWindowList module to manage windows across all of my desktops. 
In tvtwm, when you deiconify a window through the window list, the window 
manager will pop you to the desktop which contains the icon of that window 
and you are set to do work. So far, I have only been able to get fvwm to pop
the window up into my active desktop. Is there anyway to get the same
effect as tvtwm i.e. change the desktop and deiconify the window?

Thanks,

Ross

If you come from twm and go to fvwm, you'll love the FvwmIconMan
module (which is expressly built to be a replacement for the icon
manager for fvwm).

suggest you use FvwmIconMan instead.  there's been some recent mail on
the list indicating where to get the latest version (works only with
fvwm-2.0.45 and later).  it includes the functionality you ask about
below, with the addition of being significantly more configurable.  for
instance, this weekend i set up a task-bar-style icon managaer (complete
with mini-icons) using FvwmIconMan.  my config is below.

Hey ya,

I've been combing the aval. info for hours and I just can't find what
I'm looking for :(

1. In my fvwm2 setup, I'm missing the information that allows the frame
to be shown when I drag a window to a larger/smaller size.  How do I get
the frames to show?

2.  How do I get minimized program icon's to "bunch up" in the bottom
left corner of the screen?

3.  In fvwm, there was an option for "AUTORAISE" which brought the
active window to the top after a set time, how do I get that to happen
in fvwm2?

Thanks for your help!!!
Sincerly,

Somewhere in .fvwm2rc, set XORValue=255 . You might have to play with
the value a bit.

Something like this: (but change the numbers)

Style "*" IconBox +875+8+927+800
# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature....
# specify left top right bottom of box

It's now a module.  In your init and restart functions, add

+ "I"	Module FvwmAuto 500   (I think that's in milliseconds)

Hmmf.  Now if I can only get IconMan to show two managers..

Well, I seem to recall someone patching it recently so you could have 
a pixmap background to your buttons... And very nice it is too.

I think it was Patrice Fortier (??) but I'm not sure...

There is no official site for FvwmButtons for ~1 year. The last
"official" version is in the fvwm archive. You can also find a couple
of patches on the mailing-list I think.

You can get this patch here:
http://www.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/~fortier/Fvwm/

It allows FvwmButtons to look like the Enlightment version.

Greetings,

I'm a novice fvwm user (but am totally enthralled by having a truly
decent window manager to help me escape the ravages of openwindows!).

I've pieced together a .fvwm2rc file from stuff the FVWM web page
pointed me to.  However, I have a couple of problems which I'm hoping
someone(s) can help me with:

  o When I run some applications (e.g. imagetool, audiotool) under fvwm2,
	subsidiary windows, such as those for properties, don't have any
    mechanism for removing them from your screen.  Under openwindows, you
    normally can click the "pushpin" to dismiss the window, but under fvwm2
    (as I have it configured), no such clickable button exists.  Is
    there any way to configure for this?

  o When I fire up /usr/openwin/bin/xman, it doesn't work.  The only button
	which is clickable is the 'Quit' button.


Now my guess is that these applications are all written specifically for
openwindows and they just won't integrate completely with fvwm.  If
that's true, what do folks normally do under Solaris for these kinds of
tools?  Do you grab X11R6 and install it?  I find imagetool, the
calendar manager, and the answerbook pretty useful and would hate to
have to abandon them completely.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Suggestions for configuring
.fvwm2rc also are welcome.

Thanks in advance,
mb

Bind the "Close" function to a menu entry or to a button and use that
to dismiss the windows.  I've used this a lot, and it works well.  You
can even use a pushpin pixmap for the button if you like... :-)

Has anyone ever seen this?

Its fvwm 1.24r running openwindows on an UltraSparc 140E on Solaris
2.5.1. Also compiling fvwm-2.0.45 seems to work but then it eats itself
when executed.  It tries to executes every line of the .fvwm2rc file as
a module.

I tried removing all system.fvwmrc files, etc, and I still got BadAtom
when trying to run my application (Cabletron Spectrum Network Management
system).  Let me know if anyone has run into any of these problems and
have overcome them.  I'd hate to have to stop using fvwm.

	Thanks

		David

Having discovered tkman, I have tossed xman out the window.  It requires
Tcl and Tk, but it is a vast improvement on xman.

The AIX xmperf program will not run under fvwm 2.0.45 & AIX 4.2. I get the
error:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
  Serial number of failed request:  383
  Current serial number in output stream:  502

It runs under motif, and reportedly other window managers.
Is there any info I can provide that would help resolve this?

hello:

  I am writing something that wishes to talk to FVWM but it doesn't work.
I can send stuff to FVWM all right, but nothing ever comes back to me!
I have something like this to read the pipe:

  select (fd[1], &read, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
  if (FD_ISSET (fd[1], &read)
  {
    ReadFvwmInfo ();
  }

  The ReadFvwmInfo () is taken from FvwmWinList. But I _never_ read
anything! also FvwmTalk can't read anything either (it says Dead Pipe).
Where can I find docs on the comm protocol between Fvwm and its modules
(other than the source code)?

TIA

Not sure.
I installed Fvwm95 (which is based on Fvwm2) on a Solaris 2.5.1 box, which
didn't have X11R6 or anything (afaik it's X11R5). Maybe you're using
SunOS? (ack..)

doesn't that require Tcl/Tk 8.0? last time i checked Tkman was part of
TkGoodStuff and it required Tk 8.0. I only have 7.5 and I'm _not_ willing
to build yet another library..

Is Drag-n-drop going to be supported.  It's the only thing I miss from
dtwm.  I have an Fvwm buttons at the bottom of the screen that could be
made to look just like the dtwm front-panel but it would be really nice
to be able to drag a file over to the mailbox icon and have a compose
window pop up with the file as a MIME attachment.  I don't care about
run-time customization or CDE fluff but darg-n drop would be great.

If you can't do drag-n drop easily do you know of any program that will
create a window which is a drag-n-drop drop zone?

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

No, tkman works fine with Tk 7.6 and I originally ran it under 7.5.
I'm using tkman 1.8, found at ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in /usr/people/phelps/tcltk
I don't know what the current tkman rev is, but I got my copy maybe
6 months ago so it's not THAT old.

You can actually use the Wharf module which comes with the afterstep 
window manager (a fvwm1 based hack which has neXt step look and feel) 
which supports drag 'n drop. Although useable with fvwm2, it is based on 
the fvwm1.x, so you have to fiddle a bit with the oonfiguration file to 
get it working.

It is available in the AfterStep package from

	http://www.afterstep.edoc.com/

There is also a small utility called xdrop available which may be of use, 
but I'm not sure if the drag 'n drop works under anything apart from 
OpenWindows. The author's email address is:

I've just patched the button module to allow pixmaps, unfortunately the whole
bar is not filled with the background pixmap.

where there are no icons the normal colour appears and i notice that when somthing is swallowed the border around it is the original colour

would it be possible to stop the module drawing the colour in the first place and drawing the pixmap instead.

nonetheless it does look great!.

p.s. are the fvwm icons standardised to a particular colour map? if so could a collection of backgrounds conform to this map and be available on the fvwm site?

Yeah I noticed this, but when I lock and then unlock the screen the pixmap 
fills in the spaces around swallowed apps.

No they're not, at least the standard distribution ones aren't. 

And if you're on an 8-bit display like me then this can be a problem. 
If you have a set of icons like mine that share only 16 colours, then you
have more to spare for backdrops.

Excerpts from fvwm: 11-Mar-97 FVWM: AIX xmperf problem Jonathan
Edwards@intrane (680*) 

The AIX xmperf program will not run under fvwm 2.0.45 & AIX 4.2. 
<snip> 
> It runs under motif, and reportedly other window managers. 
> Is there any info I can provide that would help resolve this? 

Welcome to fun with xmperf and fvwm.  Let me start by saying I'm running
a version of AIX 4.1 and have not tried this on 4.2.  (#include
<std_disclaimer.h>) There are a couple of things that work on 4.1 that
you might try: 

1) Run with the -u option.  This is pretty painless and seems to be the
only way I can get xmperf to work on 4.1.  This option switches to popup
menus instead of the pulldown ones. 

2) You can't run a version of fvwm compiled on AIX 3.2 on 4.1 and have
xmperf work.  I'm guessing there is some incompatibility in the X11
libs.  What's weird is that xmperf is the only program I know of that
has this problem.  So if this is the case, you'll need to rebuild fvwm
on your 4.2 system. 

Good luck, 
-Bill

I don't believe the icons have  been changed to  use a standard set of
colors, but I  recently submitted a patch  to the  "workers list" that
change's the icons colors to a "standard" set as they are displayed.

This would allow users  with 24 bit  color to display icons as-is, and
users with 8 bit color to restrict colors as desired.

I think   this is a  superior  solution,  and  hope that my  patch  is
included in the next release.

Thanks, but it doesn't make any difference.
My fvwm was compiled on 4.2, on this machine.
I still get:

X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)
  Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)

RTFM.  The FAQ for fvwm 2.0.45 has:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

31) I try to run some program under FVWM, but it dies with an X11
    error like BadAccess.  The same program works just fine under MWM
    or OLWM.  What's going on?

A: The error message usually looks something like this:

        X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
        resource denied)
         Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
         Serial number of failed request:  1595
         Current serial number in output stream:  1596

   Well, this is telling you that there is a conflict in key/button
   assignments.  In your .fvwm2rc you have bound some key/button that
   this program really wants to bind to an action, but it can't since
   FVWM has already done so (but you weren't doing it in the rc file
   for your previous window manager).  Figure out what the offending
   key binding is and remove it from your .fvwm2rc, or temporarily via
   FvwmTalk by removing the FVWM binding (see the man page for the Key
   & Mouse commands).

Hello,
	I was wondering if it is possible to allow each desktop
to have a different colormap.  That way a color hogging app would
not screw up other apps.

I notice that the modules seem to handle restart effectively. That is, they
exit gracefully. I cannot seem to get my modules to do this. When I restart
fvwm, they hang until the window is manually killed. What am I overlooking?

Hmm.. I should check Wharf out then  :)
it would be instructive (for me!) to add DND to FvwmCDE :)

as for xdrop: i don't think it will work except with XView apps, because
XView has this thing called DTSM (or something like that) which implements
DND for XView apps..

Hmm.  I was under the impression you used click focus since FlipFocus

Yup, it works fine after building from scratch.

They look pretty good, though I think the full list should be
documented somewhere other than the source.  Better yet, it would be
nice if users could specify a base set of colors, perhaps by
specifying a pixmap file that contains them all, sort like the way
pixy (now why did I come up with that as an example :-) works.
There's a couple of shades of gray (gray50 and gray75) I use in the
pixmaps I use for a title bar texture that came out looking a bit
strange.

Overall, though, I like this patch a lot.

It doesn't happen very often, but I occasionally hate Gnus.  It's been
too easy to get in the habit of doing a followup to email messages
instead of replies since, in the case of email, I typically want to
send the reply to the CC list as well as the sender.  Unfortunately if
I do that in a mailing list group such as this one (where private mail
dealing with fvwm also ends up), followup works as it would in a
newsgroup so the message gets posted.  Sigh.  My apologies to Dan
Espen for sending to the entire list rather than privately.  And my
apologies to the list for the waste of bandwidth (and this one too).

type

  xmkmf -a

I think the needed sequence is:

xmkmf -a
make Mafiles
make

Look at the INSTALL file in the fvwm directory.

I'm using AfterStep's wharf with fvwm. I like its look very much and I
als fancy its `folder' feature. The problem is that it won't swallow
applications (which it does under AfterStep).

Anybody who knows why this doesn't work? Is there anything that can
be done about it?

Anybody who has managed to configure an alternative module such that it
behaves like Wharf? Would you mind sharing your config file with me?

Cheers,
-Ives

Hello:

 how does one's patches get incorporated into the "official" distribution
(that is, if they're useful and not fluff)?

needed as well.  does anyone have the necessary items already seperated
from the afterstep package?

thanks in advance,

I've noticed a strange behavior (which seems new to 2.0.45) with my
menus since upgrading.

I invoke my "main" menu for calling applications via a keystroke, and
like to poke around the menu using the arrow keys or start apps via a
single letter key stroke.  But "sometimes" (I know that isn't much help,
and I've tried to narrow this down to a specific event, but have been
unable to thus far) pressing the key invokes the menu, but then it seems
the keyboard is "disjoint" from the menu.  By disjoint I mean: no keys
have any effect on the menu.  I can not scroll down the menu, nor can
any of my letter keys (corresponding to an application name) start any
apps, nor does the ESC key get rid of the menu. . . the only thing that
can operate on the menu is the mouse.

If I can be of any assistance in narrowing down the possible causes of
this behavior please let me know.

Eric.

do you have NumLock or CapsLock pressed?  X11R6 and later have made the
*Lock keys into modifiers; fvwm has strange behavior when they're
activated (e.g., ClickToFocus works oddly if NumLock is pressed).

I can't seem to find any concrete communication between fvwm and its running
modules that takes place either at exit or restart (that is, in the Done()
routine of fvwm.c). I see where all pipes to the modules are closed, then fvwm
simple waits for all the children to expire. What are the C modules doing to
recognize that this has happened? A SIGPIPE is generated only when a process
tries to write to a defunct pipe (according to signal(5)). So a catcher for
SIGPIPE is not guaranteed to catch the exit/restart of fvwm. I'm sure it's in
the module code somewhere, but I have yet to find it.

Having delved much more deeply into the modules code, it seems that the modules
all use a processing loop derived from the same base, and that said loop does
poll (using select()) the output fd, to see that it is still writable, exiting
when it isn't.

Well, this probably won't work for a lot of other event-driven applications
besides my own exploration with Perl and Tk. A C application using the Xt or
Xm toolkits is likely to pass it's control to an event loop, and rely on
bound callbacks for handling all eventualities.

So perhaps a good idea would be a packet type of M_FVWM_EXIT (or just M_EXIT,
or similar) that is sent to all modules (regardless of mask, since this is a
fairly noteworthy event) by the Done() routine, before it closes the pipes.
This way, modules that care about exit events can respond to them-- a module
that is keeping some sort of running data can save it's data before exiting,
or a run-time configurable module could save it's current state. Most 
importantly, modules using a higher-level event loop, such as Tk-driven or
X Toolkit-driven, can opt to route a handler for this packet.

Just a thought.

My own Python/Tk modules uses tkinter.createfilehandler()
(i.e. Tcl_CreateFileHandler()) to dispatch on data available from the
fd Fvwm is writing to.  Seems like this works well, and my module does
know when Fvwm is exiting or restarting.  When I wrap a try/finally
around my call to Tk's mainloop, I can see that when I restart Fvwm,
my finally clause gets tripped after Tk's mainloop is terminated.

This might be a cleaner (and better documented) way of signalling
termination to the modules.  Although the current approach seems to
work for me, this addition probably doesn't burden Fvwm much.

On the other hand, if a module is relying on a special message to tell
it when fvwm is going away, it's not going to do The Right Thing if fvwm
doesn't exit cleanly (eg. if the X server shuts down, killing fvwm
before it can send the M_EXITs to its children).

Modules should be able to detect and deal with their pipes being closed
unexpectedly; adding a redundant (but less reliable) mechanism to signal
that fvwm is terminating would make it *less* clean.

You might have a point there.  AFAIK, Python/Tk can handle the current
arrangement just fine.

I disagree. Strongly, even. This is like saying that since a general UNIX
application cannot trap SIGKILL, why bother trapping HUP or any others.

If the X server goes away in a non-clean fashion, taking Fvwm down without
adequate time for a clean exit, then any running modules are likely to nosedive
as well, no matter what event handlers, signal handlers, etc. are set up.
That's just an unfortunate factor of programming in this environment. In such
an instance, a module is likely to get a HUP or KILL before it detects the
broken pipe anyway. But if fvwm is going to exit cleanly, then the modules
should have the same opportunity.

Do you suggest that people just not use event-driven toolkits? Leave Perl/Tk
aside for a moment, no Xt or Xaw? Since I've been writing a WinList-clone as
a sample script for the X11::Fvwm stuff, I've been looking at the source for
FvwmWinList pretty closely. To avoid using a toolkit, the authors had to
re-invent the button, adding a whole C module to the application, when Xt
could have simplified the code.

No, there should be some means by which an application that is X-event-driven
can also handle the fvwm interface. Now, if someone can suggest a good place
to put a regular test for the fd validity, that's different. Then it's more
feasible. But all the callbacks that are currently in my app are bound to
specific events-- availability of data on the input-fd from fvwm, a specific
packet type, or an X event handled by Tk.

Perhaps a test that takes place after every successful packet read? This could
be added into whatever routine is called upon receipt of data from fvwm.

No, definately not.

Though I do invoke my menu through a little function/hack so it always
pops up in the lower left hand corner.

The MS keyboard window key is assigned to Kanji by xmodmap:

	keycode 115 = Kanji

and Kanji is bound to a function in my .fvwmrc.keys file:

	Key Kanji       A       A       PopupUtils Utilities

and PopupUtils is defined as follows:

AddToFunc PopupUtils    "I"     CursorMove -1000 +1000
+                       "I"     Exec vplay
/usr/local/sound/win95/Robotz.Menu.Popup.wav
+                       "I"     Popup Utilities


But I never had any problems with this before upgrading to 2.0.45.

OK, but consider for a bit the possibility that you might like to tell a
module go away without quitting FVWM.  It seems better to ask the module to
go away, rather than just yanking its input stream.  An EXIT packet
wouldn't necessarily tell the module that FVWM is going away, but only that
the module should go away.

I'm assuming, of course, that there isn't already an EXIT packet.  It's
been a while since I hacked on FVWM modules.

Of course, modules should still properly handle FVWM croaking anyway.

I've gotten around my earlier problems by looking for an error return from
sysread (the perl equivalent of C's read(), since perl's read is actually
build on the buffered-IO layer) and (for now) not even using select() to poll
my fd's. I am also inquiring on the perl list if there are any known bugs with
select on HP's (luckily, we have a guy from HP support on the list).

So I am handling exits all right, and will probably add in a special handler
category in my perl module to allow programmers to respond to the exit. But
I still think M_EXIT would be a good idea:

Packet:
word 1	:-	Window ID      \
word 2	:-	Fvwm Frame ID   > These three are standard
word 3	:-	Fvwm window ID /
word 4	:-	Restart: 0 if Fvwm is really quitting, 1 if Fvwm is doing a
			Restart (as is denoted by the flag to Done() in fvwm.c)

Hello:

  I installed FVWM-2.0.45 on an SGI. And the windows don't "rubber-band"
when I move them (you can't see either an outline or the full window's
position, just the x,y coordinates displayed by FVWM). How is this? 4Dwm
(the SGI default window manager) is about 15x the size of fvwm2, and I
don't like its look-and-feel too much..

Hello:

  I was wondering how to set the icon size to be fixed in the .fvwmrc
file. There's some code in fvwm/icons.c like this:

  /* First, see if it was specified in the .fvwmrc */
  tmp_win->icon_p_height = 0;
  tmp_win->icon_p_width = 0;

This is from 2.0.45, in 2.0.43 they were _not_ set to zero. I would like
all icons to be fixed in size, and transparent/shaped icons to be not
supported (e.g. I want the iconic behavior of 4Dwm or DTWM where all
icons are the same-size boxes; I think AfterStep does this too). 

I can always hack the source, but I would prefer not to (an .fvwmrc
setting is more portable).

Thanks!

I went to the fvwm archives (URL at the bottom of every message), typed in
"rubber band" and lo and behold, the answer to your question magically
appeared.  Isn't technology wonderful?

Hint: read the manual page, look for XORvalue.  You can even search for
"rubber.*band" there, too.

Nonsense.  SIGHUP serves one purpose--usually that of telling a process
that it should try to shut itself down cleanly--and SIGKILL serves a
completely different purpose--that of forcing a process to exit whether
it wants to or not.

Closing the file descriptor does not force the module to exit any more
than sending an M_EXIT would--either event is a request to clean up and
exit.  (For that matter, a module is free to continue running and do
anything it wants to--except receive information from and send commands
to fvwm.)

However, there are even already a few modules out there which are not
themselves X11 programs--consider FvwmAudio and FvwmAuto, for example.
The X server could go away and they'd never know the difference if they
weren't checking for EOF on the pipe to fvwm.

The modules *do* have the same opportunity--they can detect EOF on their
pipe and exit cleanly.  But it's very much possible that whatever caused
fvwm to exit abruptly--whether it was an X server crash or something
else--*didn't* kill the modules, and in such a case the modules could
wind up in a CPU loop trying to read a defunct file descriptor.

In order to receive the M_EXIT packet, a program first needs to read the
pipe from fvwm; if it knows enough to read from the pipe, surely it can
detect an EOF condition on it?

That's pretty much what fvwm is saying when it closes its end of the pipe.
For example, fvwm does this when doing a Restart--it's telling the
modules to exit, even though fvwm itself keeps going.

For reference, the documentation (docs/modules.tex) says:
| Special attention is paid to the status of the pipe. If Fvwm gets a read
| error on a module-to-fvwm  pipe, then it assumes that the module is
| terminating, and all communication with the module is terminated.
| Similarly, if a module gets a read error on an fvwm-to-module pipe, then

| down.  All modules should also allow themselves to be shut down via the
| Delete Window protocol for X-11.

i was curious:

i would like for my desktop to all fit on my screen without any scrolling.

i'm kinda getting tired of scrolling around the desktop.. call it lazy..
;)

anyways, curious what setting in the .rc file will accomplish this? 

(basically, for example, if i want the entire desktop to fit into a 
800x600 resolution, what do i change?)

ALSO, wanted to say that i'm lovin' 2.0.45... i REALLY like all the decor
mod's, and the feel... i was runnin' .42 up until 2 days ago because i was
too lazy to download and compile the newest one.. ;P ...

thanx in advance..

Units are in physical screens.

If that doesn't do it for you, you're probably using a PC-type machine
with an SVGA-type graphics card which does hardware scrolling (they
call this "panning" I think).  I'm not sure how to turn it off, but
I've seen a "Virtual" statement in XF86config once.

&nbsp; If you are using XF86 you will need to go to your XF86Config file
and change the virtual resolution in whatever section your paticular graphics

to match true resolution. If you have a resolution of 800x600 set virtual
to 800x600.&nbsp;

just a note, when I saw that message, first thing I did was look at the
X-Mailer header. It was Netscape 4.0b2. The default in the new Netscape is
to send HTML mail. Please, anyone using the new Netscape, turn the `send

Hi,

Does anyone know how to have multiple invisible IconBox's?  For example,
after iconifying a row of icons at the bottom of my screen,  I'd like
the next iconified windows to be placed in another row just above the
row on the bottom.
I've tried this:

Style "*" IconBox 5 -312 -5 -239
Style "*" IconBox 5 -234 -5 -161
Style "*" IconBox 5 -156 -5 -83
Style "*" IconBox 5 -78 -635 -5

This worked in fvwm version 1,  but in version 2 I guess only the last
IconBox is the one used,  as soon as that one is filled up the icon just
goes to dumb placement around the desktop.  I've also tried a larger IconBox:

Style "*" IconBox 5 -250 -635 -5

and this line in the FvwmIconBox options:

*FvwmIconBoxPlacement   Left Bottom

But for some reason the icons still place top-to-bottom for the 'secondary'
placement.
The multiple boxes would be better instead of one big box with bottom-to-
top secondary placement because I'd like the boxes to be of different
sizes.
Does someone know what I can try?

Sorry for a slightly off-topic post. I'd like to map the dead keys on
my new "natural" keyboard to fvwm actions. I understand the "key"
directive, and I have xkeycaps to help, but I can't seem to come up
with a xmodmap that will use the keys w/o some modifier (Alt, shift,
etc.) I remember a post about this, and I've been searching the web'd
archives for a while, but I can't seem to find this. Can someone help
out?

Do you mean _scrolling_ or _page flipping_? The former is probably
handled by your X server (e.g. XFree86 can be configured to do so),
while the latter is a function of Fvwm. If you need information on how
to configure your X server, then it would be helpful to let us know
which server you currently use.

I wanted to do the same thing. Its setup on my machine at home. I can't 
remember exactly what the codes were, but here is how to find out:

	1/ Run 'xev' in an xterm
	
	2/ Click on the xev window and hit the key you want to find
	   Note the keycode for the key
	
	3/ open .xinitrc in an editor and type the following

		xmodmap -e "keycode <one noted above> = Fxx"
	
	where xx is say 13 ('cos most PC keyboards only have function 
	keys up to F13')

	4/ open .fvwm2rc and add the following line

	Key F13 A A Menu Root Nop

	or whatever

Hope this helps....

	The following lines appear in a file called ".Xmodmap" which resides in
my home directory.  115 is the left window key, 116 is the right window
key, 117 is the "right click" key:

keycode 115 = Kanji
keycode 116 = Henkan
keycode 117 = Muhenkan
keycode 22 = BackSpace

	Then I have the following line in my .Xclients file.  It should go into
a file which is read upon startup of your X session.  This executes
xmodmap, and has it read the above keycodes, assigning them to usable
names:

xmodmap .Xmodmap
	
	Now the names can be bound to any functions or events in your .fvwmrc. 
I have my 2 window keys doing different things.

### Microsoft Keyboard special Keys and their Functions
Key Kanji       A       A       PopupUtils Utilities
Key Henkan      A       A       Prev [*] focus
Key Muhenkan    A       A       PopupOps Window-Ops


Luck++;
Eric.

The latest  version of the colorlimit patch  has more colors  and some
changes to the man page description.

Since I  submitted the original patch,  I took the hsv calculation out
of pixy and analysed the  colors in my list for  gaps.  I ran thru all
the rgb  values, 00 thru FF incrementing  by 11 (16x16x16  colors) and
found all the peaks in the gaps and filled them in.  The original list
had 41 colors and now I have 61.  The gaps as measured by pixy were up
in the 1300 range and are now down in the 300 range.

There is a big gap down in the very dark colors that I have ignored.

First, you will need to use xev to find out the keycode of the win95
keys, as someone else mentioned.  The actual value of the keys will not
necessarily be the same on all computers.  My work and home computers
have different keycodes.

Another poster mentioned how to bind a function key to a win95 key.
I find it more useful to use the win95 keys as a modifiers.  What I do
is hit the win95 key (like a shift key) and then some other key to 
have it do window operations.

Here is my .xmodmaprc file

--------------- .xmodmaprc -------------------
! Add mod5 (Windows '95 icon key)
clear mod5
keycode 115 = Super_L
keycode 116 = Super_R
add mod5 = Super_L Super_R
--------------- End .xmodmaprc -------------------

The 115 and 116 will probably be different on your system. Then in my
.xesssion file (ran automaticaly), I put

xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmaprc

Now the win95 keys are mod 5.  Here are some lines from my .fvwm2rc.

# press arrow + Mod5 anywhere, and scroll by 1 page
Key Left	A	5	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	5	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	5	Scroll +0   -100
Key Down	A	5	Scroll +0   +100

Key i	A	5	Iconify
Key l	A	5	Lower
Key q	A	5	Popup Quit-Verify
Key r	A	5	Raise
Key t	A	5	RaiseLower
Key x	A	5	Exec xlock -mode random

Hope you find this useful.

Well, I know that under X (on my machine), the key with the arrow
pointing at a menu is called "Menu", and the Windows Icon keys are called
"Meta-R" and "Meta-L" depending on Left or Right... I have "Menu" bound to
bring up a list of window-ops if pressed within a window... And Although
this prolly isn't too great of an idea, I have Meta-L bound to a
RaiseLower if pressed within a window.. Hope this helps...

I'm running fvwm2, version 2.0.41 on a Sparc 2 running SunOS. 
Everything seems to be working fine, but I can't get my
Good..., err, FvwmButtons to swallow things like an xclock.
The line I have is:

*FvwmButtons(Swallow xclock 'Exec xclock -bg \#908090 -geometry -1500-1500 -padding 0 &')

This exact line works fine on a linux box running 2.0.42, and I can run
the xclock from the command line.

Any ideas about what could be going on?

Also, are there any web pages with fvwm2 configs out there? I've found a bunch
of sample configs for 1.*, but not 2.*


Thanks for your help,

ok, another question... :)

i am running TKGoodStuff as an FVWM2 module (fvwm 2.0.45) and am having
some sort of a redraw problem..

when TKGoodStuff initially loads up, the WindowList Client in TKGoodStuff
isnt being displayed, but then, when i have it Auto-Minimize, and then
move the mouse over it again, the WindowList shows up...

this leads me to believe that this is some sort of redraw problem...
anyone else have this type of errant behavior? or is this the norm?

also, a more FVWM2 relavent question: 

	is UserPlacement the default window placement method? i read
through the man pages, and read about smartplacement and others, but didnt
catch anything about userplacement... (then again, it was at 2am last
night..).. 

anyways, how can i define all windows to be placed by me? 

	Style "*" UserPlacement
?

or just remove all the other Placement methods to default to
userplacement?

thanx bunch!! :)

You need to patch fvwm2.  The patch is in the main directory of 
the tkgoodstuff distribution, and I believe that it will be in the
next release of fvwm2.

I would like to make the 'Help' key on my Sun keyboard send a 'p' key event
to xmcd, no matter where it is, so I can use the big 'Help' key as a simple
play/pause key. That way I don't have to find xmcd, click on it, then click
on the play/pause button.

Unfortunately I know this won't work across displays (I have a dual-headed
machine), so I'll have to at least be on the right screen, but that will
be OK.

So can anyone finish the following line in such a way as to do what
I want? :-)

Key Help        A       A

Thanks,
Eddy

If you're using XFree86 (and not Accel/X or Metro/X) you just need to add

  Virtual 800 600

in your Screen section (if 800x600 is the physical resolution of your
screen)

hello:

i'd like to ask a few questions about patching fvwm and contributions

  a) how do i submit a patch? can anyone do this or do you have to be
     "empowered" or something  :)

  b) does anyone have a patch for "boxed icons" (like DTWM, 4DWm, or
     even AfterStep)? i would like this kind of behavior for my CDE
     emulator and I'm willing to patch fvwm myself, but since I'm not 
     so hot at Xlib programming, it's gonna be some work and i don't
     feel inclined to do so if it's not incorporated in the "official"
     distribution

reason for my last sentence: i made a patch to fvwm to fix the titling
badness when the window is too narrow for the title (to 2.0.43). imagine
my dismay when the patch didn't apply cleanly to 2.0.45. so i would like
that if a patch i make is actually useful to everyone, that it has a
chance of making it into the official distribution (so i don't rewrite
the damn thing when a new release of fvwm comes out)..

ttfn

Well it may be that your login session doesn't have the complete path
statement that you expect, and so FVWM can't find xclock. This is quite a
common problem for x-terminals, in my experience. Try putting the complete
path for xclock in the Exec statement. Also, it may be having trouble with
the extra command line options. Try, specifying a colour by name instead
of rgb numbers and drop the geometry statement (irrelevant anyway seeing as
you're going to swallow the window.)

There's some on the Window Managers for X site at

although they're a bit dated... Oh and check out my page too ;)

HI! I have a patch that makes iconified fvwm windows have the NextStep 
Gradient-shaded look (and are thus 64x64 boxes). This patch applies 
cleanly to fvwm 2.0.45 and can be found by following a link from my 
homepage at: 
	http://hepserver.nhn.ou.edu/~spielman/

Chuck: If I modify this patch so it is another icon-style (GradientIcon) 
Would there be any chance that it would be accpeted to the standard 
distribution for 2.0.46? The code is clean and it is no more hack-like 
than any other part of fvwm. (Which doesn't accualy say very much)

i've got a `patch' for gradient-ized icons that i've been using since
fvwm-1.24r ... it's called the 3d-pixmaps collection.  not that hard to
use, they're all 56x46, and they're all decent-looking.  it's easy
enough to use a tool like ImageMagick to make mini-icons and to get the
number of colors used to <=64 (in case you're still using an antiquated
video card that only gives you 8bpp).  why do we need another patch for
gradient icons when these things are available?  that kind of stuff just
adds bloat to fvwm.

weeks (months?).  I've been super busy both at work and at home, so
I've been forced to basically ignore a lot of email concerning fvwm
(and anything else non-real-work related).

I wish to apologize - I hope no one feels slighted by this, but it has
been necessary.  I do have all of the notes archived locally and I've
been making notes about which ones I need to go back to, consider for
2.0.46, etc.  So hopefully I'll address them all eventually. :)

I did pick up this patch both the first time you posted it and again
when you brought it up again.  I looked at it briefly and it's not too
bad, but I can't guarantee that it'll make it into 2.0.46 (I have to
think about its potential impact to getting 2.1.0 out finially, which
I'd like to do so bigger fixes/changes can be made).

It (or some variant of its idea) will make it in eventually though.

I could just put it in as is right now as a compile time option, but
to do it "right" I'd like to clean things up and have that and the
titlestyle stuff (and eventually the menu code, since someone asked
for that too) all share some gradient code, which is a sizable change
that means it should really wait until after 2.1.0.

Plus, it might not be bad to add some additional code to be able to
specify a specific XPM to use as the icon bg instead of the Gradient,
a way to set the size instead of a fixed 64x64, how any border should
be drawn, how the icon title text box should look, etc.  Uh-oh - this
is begininng to sound like it should be a new config parm, IconStyle.
Well, I guess That'd fit in with this new borderstyle / titlestyle /
decor thing we have going now.  More food for thought anyways...

But, perhaps I could just put it in as a compile time option nearly
'as is' just to keep people happy for now, then fix things up later.
I'll have to think about that some more...

Taken too long to type this...back to the grind...

Thanks for all the help everyone, lots of good ideas. But alas, none
have worked. Putting the complete path: nothing. Taking out the
options: still nothing.

I'm just resigned I think to it not working with current set up for
some reason. Perhaps I'll try recompiling if I get ambitious.

I am running fvwm on a SUN SPARC20 using Adobe (?) OpenWindows (not 
sure). I used fvwm from /usr/contrib/ in the andrew file system that the 
university here has.

I use xemacs as well as framemaker, and the <Ctrl>+Arrowkey and the 
<Meta>+ Arrowkeys key bindings in fvwm (to shift between pages as well 
desktops) hinders with some important commands in xemacs and framemaker. 
I don't have a .fvwmrc file, but I obviously need to create one to 
supersede the <Ctrl>+Arrowkey and <Meta>+ Arrowkeys keybindings in fvwm. 
I would appreciate it if I could know what all include to in my .fvwmrc 
file to supersede these bindings or bind them to some other keys.

Thanks

Moneesh

Copy the system.fvwmrc (or is it system.fvwm2rc?) to your home
directory as ~/.fvwmrc (or ~/.fvwm2rc) and edit it.

Example what to look for:

Key Down        A       4       Next [CurrentDesk] Function GoThere
                                ^
                                Function to execute
                        ^
                        Modifier, can be S(hift), C(trl), M(eta),
                        or a number 1 thru 5.  Type "xmodmap -pm"
                        to see what keys are associated with which
                        number
                ^
                Context, A means any, W means window, T means
                title, ...  see man page for details
    ^
    Key name.  Down, Left, Right, Up are the arrow keys

I'm having a problem placing very short windows (< 16pixels high) at the
bottom of the desktop and very narrow windows (<16 pixels wide) at the
right side of the desktop.  In each case, a request for position at the
very edge fails, and instead the window is placed so that its top (or left)
side is exactly 16 pixels from the bottom (or right) of the desktop.  This
behavior happens only at the bottom or right of the DESKTOP; the bottom
or right side of pages that are not at the bottom or right side of the
desktop work fine.  I'm using 2.0.45 on XFree Linux.

To see the bug, try

  xclock -geometry 100x1+0-0

and move to the bottom of your desktop (this supposes you don't 
decorate xclock much, and that it's sticky).

Thanks for any advice.

Mark

Hi,

I am using fvwm2 (2.0.41) as my window manager under Linux.

All is fine, bar one annoying problem, that of menus occasionally 
disappearing underneath the parent window.  Click on the menu, and 
try again and all is fine.  I have tried all the focus modes 
(followsmouse, sloppyfocus (my normal one) and click to focus), all to 
no avail.  Anyone got any good ideas?

Cheers,

Gary.

The following is from the FAQ:

31) I try to run some program under FVWM, but it dies with an X11
    error like BadAccess.  The same program works just fine under MWM
    or OLWM.  What's going on?

A: The error message usually looks something like this:

        X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private
        resource denied)
         Major opcode of failed request:  28 (X_GrabButton)
         Serial number of failed request:  1595
         Current serial number in output stream:  1596

   Well, this is telling you that there is a conflict in key/button
   assignments.  In your .fvwm2rc you have bound some key/button that
   this program really wants to bind to an action, but it can't since
   FVWM has already done so (but you weren't doing it in the rc file
   for your previous window manager).  Figure out what the offending
   key binding is and remove it from your .fvwm2rc, or temporarily via
   FvwmTalk by removing the FVWM binding (see the man page for the Key
   & Mouse commands).


I am runing Fvwm2 pl 43 on a Solaris 2.5.1 box with x11r6.1.

Well with that said and done.  My problem is this, when I try iconifying my
application with a title button selection (the following is from my button
style file for this button:

ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (-- raised) ActiveDown (-- sunk) Inactive (-- flat)
AddButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (Pixmap /home/misha21/icon/Re-jlower.xpm) ActiveDown
(
Pixmap /home/misha21/icon/Re-mini.xpm) Inactive (Pixmap
/home/misha21/icon/Re-jx
.xpm)

and this is the mouse settings for this button:

Mouse 0 4       A       Iconify), my application dies like the above FAQ, but
when I use the keyboard selection (Key L7 on the sun keyborad, and here is the
setting:
Key L7          A       A       Iconify) it iconifies just fine.

Does anyone out there have any idea why the same "Iconify" works from the
keyboard but not from the title bar?

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

BTW here is the error message I am getting:

xtent: fatal error encountered at line 1401, message 3.
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  2006
  Current serial number in output stream:  2006


Thank You

Hi!

I recently downloaded fvwm-2.0.45 and tried to compile in on my SunOS 4.1.3
Sparc station. It complained about the Xpm library not being found. I got
that from ftp.cdrom.com. Then it told me that the Xext library could not be
found?

I got Xext from the R6.3 subdir on ftp.cdrom.com and it complained about the
Threads.tmpl file not being found.

What is the best way to compile (and use ;) fvwm on SunOS 4.1.3?

Regards,
.. rajesh

Maybe it has some problems running the app period! I also seem to have a
similar problem with xlock on slowlaris and linux boxes, but not under
IRIX. The setups for each are identical (in fact, it's the same
.fvwm2rc)... I've tried checking path's n' stuff to make sure everything
was working (i.e. I was running other stuff just fine from within the same
path, so I figured putting the entire path to xlock would do no good).
I'll check later this week...

I don't think so. I also wrote my own patch and it only added a few dozens
of lines of code to borders.c. That's not much in the way of bloat.

And yes, I tried the CD pixmaps collection: and it doesn't meet my needs.
Why? because some applications provide their own icon windows, and I don't
want to replace these. And I was icons-in-a-box (never mind the gradients)
because this is the behavior provided by DTWM (and 4DWm, and..) I aim to
make my CDE emulator (FvwmCDE) as CDE-like as possible, and this is just
one of those things..

Hello,

a long time ago I asked if it is possible to move a window to the upper
right corner, i. e. perform a command "move -0p 0p". I would like to
assign that command to a title bar button. Unfortunately it seems that
nobody has a solution for this problem. Charles Hines suggested to
modify the move command accordingly but this doesn´t seem to be done so
far (Fvwm 2.0.45).

So I would like to know if someone has an idea how to simulate the
command. Thank you very much in advance.

Hello,

I hope this isn´t a FAQ, at least I could find it in any documents
available to me. If the question is asked frequently please point me to
a source where I can find the anwer.

My problem:

I would like to know if there is a way to (temporary) disable the global
key settings for a specific application. E. g. I have bound the
following to my function keys (in ~/.fvwm2rc):

Key F1          WTSF    N       Iconify
Key F2          WTSF    N       Raise
Key F3          WTSF    N       Lower
Key F4          WTSF    N       Maximize 0 100
Key F5          WTSF    N       Module FvwmIdent
Key F6          WTSF    N       Refresh
Key F7          WTSF    N       Delete
Key F8          WTSF    N       Destroy
Key F9          WTSF    N       Restart fvwm2
Key F10         WTSF    N       Stick
Key F11         WTSF    N       Next [*] Focus
Key F12         WTSF    N       Prev [*] Focus

Now I would like to start an application that also makes use of the
function keys. An example of such an application is Emacs. But with the
boundings above they won´t work of course. I understand that I could
modify the context from "WTSF" to "TSF", but that is not what I usually
want since I prefer to use the function keys anywhere within my windows.

If someone has an idea what I could do (Style option?), please let me
know. Thank you very much in advance.

this line prompted a question i've had for a while now, is there a way
to get at those icons?  with windows i remember some icon manager
programs could extract and let you replace these.  is the same kind of
functionality possible with xapps and fvwm?

Anyone have a recipe for starting fvwm instead of VUE? Our HP's seem
to ignore my .xsession file.

Thanks in advance!

Hi,


Easy, but hard to find ... :

If your hp starts VUE then put :

exec /your/fvwm/command

at the beginning of your .vueprofile in your home directory


If your hp starts CDE then put :

exec /your/fvwm/command

at the beginning of your .dtprofile in your home directory

Do you have trouble swallowing any other applications? Does it
have to be xclock in your button bar? You could try another clock, after
all there's plenty of good freeware clocks about.

Yes they do ignore the .xsession by default, to change that you have to
modify /usr/vue/config/Xsession, or just put something like this at the
bottom of your .vueprofile:

exec $HOME/.xsession >&! $HOME/.xsessionlog

I start it another way.

I use a no-window session and run the x11start command whith
the following .x11start file...

Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-Description: .x11start

#! /bin/sh
#####################################################
### X Window System Starting-Configuration Script ###
#####################################################
###
###  This shell script sets initial X11 clients.  It is
###  passed as a parameter to xinit and run by xinit along with the 
###  X11 server.  When this script terminates the X Window System will
###  terminate.
###
###  1) Standard output and error output for programs started by this script
###  are redirected to $HOME/.x11startlog.  This avoids output to the screen
###  that would detract from the window display.  If an error occurs starting
###  X11, the logfile would be a good place to look for a clue to the problem.
###  You can view the file by typing ``more .x11startlog'' at the command
###  prompt of your home directory.

exec >$HOME/.x11startlog 2>$HOME/.x11startlog

###  2) Setup a default WMDIR if it is not set (for use by HP Windows/9000).

: ${WMDIR:="/dev/screen"}; export WMDIR

# if there was no $HOME/.Xdefaults, $doxrdb is set to
#    'xrdb -nocpp -load /usr/lib/X11/sys.Xdefaults'
# otherwise this is a nop.

$doxrdb
unset doxrdb 

###  4) The following X clients start as part of the initial window
###  system environment.  Users can change or add to these default clients
###  to set up a custom environment.  All clients started in this script
###  should be run in the background.
###
###  x11start can pass global parameters to this script.  For example,
###  it can pass a ``hostname:display.screen'' for all clients to use.
###  Another use would be to pass an additional parameter that
### all of the clients accept, such as "-xrm *foreground blue".  If the
### user does not pass in a parameter, '$@' is null.

/opt/hppd/bin/X11/fvwm2 $@ &   	# Start the Motif-based Window Manager.
#/usr/local/X11R5/bin/afterstep $@ &    # Start the Motif-based Window Manager.


sleep 5     # Allow time for initializing mwm before starting other clients.
hpterm -C -geometry 80x24+1+1 $@ &

###  Add client commands below, one command per line.
###  End each command line with an ampersand (&).

###  5) The following "wait" call ensures that all terminated
###  child processes are cleaned up (i.e., no <defunct> processes are
###  left around).

wait

###  6) All X clients started by this script have terminated at this point.
###  Now sleep forever (if this script terminates the window system will
###  be terminated).  When the window system is terminated with
###  [Shift][CTRL][Reset] this script will be killed.

exec sleep 2000000000

###  The window system is terminated when this script is terminated. ###

This works but will prevent any of the CDE tooltalk stuff from starting.  An 
alternative is to put:

dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /your/fvwm/command

in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  Use this file even if you use xrdb. Some things to
note:
 1) Before you change to Fvwm use the Style manager to choose "Return to Home"
    as the session type otherwise CDE will try to restart apps after a logout.
 2) Quitting Fvwm won't log you out, "Exec dtaction ExitSession" will work.
 3) For some reason it takes about 1 minute to log in. Something is timing out.
 4) You can lock the display with "Exec dtaction LockDisplay"
 5) You can't drop file manager icons on the root window, but you can use
    "Put in workspace" from the button3 popup on an icon.
    
Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

  Anyone have a recipe for starting fvwm instead of VUE? Our HP's seem
  to ignore my .xsession file.

Unofficially speaking, I managed to change the /usr/vue/config/Xconfig file
on HPUX 10.10. I changed the line about Vuelogin*xdmMode. These lines now
look like:

############################################################################
#  To set a display to run the user's XDM $HOME/.xsession script as the
#  default session. Ensure that the $HOME/.xsession script is executable.
#
#  Vuelogin*xdmMode:           True
Vuelogin*xdmMode:           True

Lots of suggestions, but nobody mentioned this:

CDE XDM has a menu on the xdm window that allows you to choose the mode.
(least in my experience ;)  One of the options is openwindows.  When I
select this, when I log in I get fvwm instead of cde (becaue my .xsession
starts fvwm instead of openwindows)  Perhaps there's an option like this on
the HP?  CDE XDM quite convieniently remembers what your last chosen mode is
once you put in your username, so you only have to set it once.  Couldn't
say about HP, though all the HP's I've had the (mis?)fortune to stumble
across here have been running CDE.

The following packets are not documented in modules.tex:

	M_DEFAULTICON
	M_MINI_ICON
	M_ICON_FILE
	M_WINDOWSHADE
	M_DEWINDOWSHADE

I have figured out M_DEFAULTICON-- it is three zeros followed by the ASCII
representation of the filename for the default icon, taken from a statement
of the nature:

	Style "*" Icon name.xpm

M_ICON_FILE appears to have the same format. M_MINI_ICON, however, doesn't
seem to be transmitting a file name (it uses SendPacket() rather than
SendName() to send its data).

As for M_WINDOWSHADE and M_DEWINDOWSHADE, I can't make heads or tails of those.

I followed the instructions in the INSTALL file and have encountered a
problem.  I am on Solaris 2.5x, a SPARCstation 5.  The parameters
specified in the Makefile uses the install command to copy the files 
from the source directory to the dest using  install -c -m XXXX file
dest.  this is a problem because install requires that -c be followed by
a filename.  I tried to modify the Makefile, but had no luck.  I have
also tried to copy the files and chmod them manually.  I was able to do
the modules and the fvwm binary, but I am stuck now because I have no
idea where the other suff goes.  If possible can you assist me in
getting this to work, and if there is a Makefile available for Solaris
2.5x can you tell me where I can find it.  Any help will greatly be
appreciated.
Thanks.

I am running fvwm 2.045 on a sun with Solaris 2.5.1 and X11R6.3.  I have gone
through all my pixmap selections and my fvwmrc to try to minimize colour
usage, but still seem to have used up all my colours.  I have recently
discovered the cnice program, and it gives me the following information about
my colour usage:

used: 2, shared: 254, free: 0

So, does anyone know of an easy way to find out where all my colours are
going?

(Please note headers if replying. This is being sent to multiple mailing lists,
and the Reply-To: is changed to a different address, the actual support address
rather than this address, which is just a matter of convenience)

* * *

Version 0.1 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days. In the meantime, the beginnings of a
web page for the package resides at:

	http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm

like the package itself, this page still needs work :-). But it does include
the module manual page, a snapshot of a sample Tk-based application, and will
soon have links to download the module through CPAN sites.

This is an alpha release. Not all planned features are in, not all data
packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
style and overall functionality are still subject to drastic change before
this moves into beta.

>From the README file for 0.1:

X11::Fvwm version 0.1 (alpha 1)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with the Tk extension as your GUI library!

This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is very
highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk (which is
Tk400.202 as of this writing), also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

I figured this out because I had the EXACT same problem.  You can do it by
knowing the OPENWINHOME is /usr/openwin and looking at the definitions of
all the other symbols used. 

The .n files were originally .man - the solaris implimentation of install
doesn't change filenames, and -c only installs the new version if there
isn't a file there already.  Also, my module installation directory is
customized.

To fix the install in the makefiles would require:
- reording the parameters to a legal format
- renaming the .man files to .n BEFORE the install, instead of with it.
- changing the option from -c to -f so you actually get a new version, if
you're upgrading.

Personally, i got fed up with trying to figure out how the oblique install
command works and tired of its cryptic man page, and just moved the files
manually.

the program: (./fvwm)

/usr/local/bin/fvwm2

There are two different "install"s in solaris; normal users have
/usr/ucb/install ahead in the PATH, but when you become superuser
to do the "make install", /usr/sbin/install comes first in the PATH
and it's completely different.  I got it to work by editing
/usr/openwin/lib/config/Imake.tmpl to include the line

#define InstallCmd /usr/ucb/install

or you could also try
# PATH=/usr/ucb:$PATH export PATH
# make install

Greetings.  This identical issue has been previously raised at least by
   Thuan Tran <thuan@webway.jkoss.com> (9aug96), 
   Jason Lingohr <lingman@parabolis.cyber.com.au> (25jun96),
   Greg Veres <gveres@espresso.uwaterloo.ca> (25oct95)
so if someone can come up with an answer maybe it can get into the FAQ ?

Xterm will run fine from the command line, but not from the Utilities
menu (button 1).  It gets a "Error 14, errno 22: Invalid argument"
error as a result of trying to open /dev/tty and receiving an EINVAL.
I don't see why xterm should be trying to open /dev/tty in any case...

I'm using /usr/openwin/bin/xterm, fvwm-1.24r, CDE and Solaris 2.5.1,
but the others above have been using all sorts of different versions.

What are we doing wrong ? Hasn't someone got a workaround for this ?

Hi,
 I was wondering if anybodies thinking about making fvwm2 do texture-
mapping similar to afterstep. I still prefer fvwm2, but love those 
texture-effects!
thanks,

Make sure if  you are running   Netscape, that you minimize  its color
usage.  Usually by starting netscape with the "-install" option.

Do a web  search and  find  the utility "colormap"  by Barry  Solomon.
This might be helpful.  It can't  really identify which application is
using the colors but it does provide some information.

Check out the  colorlimiting patch  which I posted   to  this group  a
couple of days ago.   If you missed it, send  me mail and I will  send
you a copy.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi, it seems that I cannot run xlock at all on sun's from within fvwm2. I
don't understand why I'm having this problem. I don't have it under IRIX,
Linux/XFree86 or Linux/AccelX. I also checked and seem to have the same
problem under fvwm 1.24r. I probably never noticed it before cuz I try not
to use the suns on campus. 
	The suns are SS5's running Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) without
CDE. They've each got 32 meg ram.
	What perplexes me is that xlock will work whenever I run it,
except from within fvwm2 or fvwm. I've tried several things. I tried
writing a shell script that exec'd xlock, I tried the full path, I tried
without the &, with the &... and nothing. Even stranger, is that if I
login to X in safe mode (type in passwd and press F1, get only an xterm
and nothing else, no WM), and if I then run my .xsession manually, I don't
get the problem. If I do that, I can run xlock as I normally would from
within fvwm2. My sysadmin claims he debugged a similar problem a while
back and said that if the USER env isn't properly set in the .xsession
(which I figured was a system thing, but what the hell... suns are
screwy), that things like that wouldn't work properly. I tried setting
both USER and user in my .xsession but neither worked... I'm just curious
as to whether anyone else has noticed this problem as well. 
	I figure that xlock is standard all over the place, but I don't
know what sun did to their version in order to make it all nice and
stuff... Does anyone know where I can find xlock so I can try compiling it
myself? I figure maybe that will help... In any case, here are a few lines
from my .fvwm2rc in case anyone thinks it may be important. The following
is what I use by default in fvwm2rc:

+       "Random"        exec xlock -mode random -remote -allowaccess &

This is what I eventually ended up with

+       "Lock n' stuff" exec /usr/openwin/bin/xlock &

Again... neither of these worked... And I seem to also have the same
problem under vtwm, so I guess it's not just an fvwm thing.

	As for the fellow having problems swallowing xclock, I am assuming
it may be part of the same problem I am having. My suggestion for a
freeware clock would be to grab the afterstep distribution and install the
asclock binary in the modules directory. It's probably the best,
non-obstructive, informing, ATTRACTIVE clock that I've seen. If you'd like
to see how I set mine up in a button bar, check out:

	http://www.fiu.edu/~kvarga01/computing/linux/Prod-fvwm2.html

This one is the predecessor to my CD-fvwm2 and I think it sports a rather
productive environment... Thats for any help...

I'm an X dummy, so pardon me if I'm totally wrong about this or if it
has nothing to do with FVWM.

On all X systems I've seen so far, you can use the mouse to copy and
paste text between windows (shells, netscape, mail, ...). What I'd
like to know is whether it would be possible to get hold of the
contents of that buffer (managed by the window manager???) from within
a shell or perl script so I can feed it as an argument to various
programs.

TIA,
-Ives

I was wondering if it is possible to get a taskbar dedicated part in my

I've seen this on dec-unix and I sort of like it.

fvwm95 has a seperate taskbar, but I don't like that.

Has anyone done this?

I'm running fvwm2 on a Solaris 2.5 system (SS-20) and haven't experienced
any problems with xlock. I checked my path, though, and noticed that I'm
picking up the X11R5 version of xlock (which we put in /usr/X11/bin)
rather than Sun's version:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 bin         78952 Jun  8  1994 /usr/X11/bin/xlock
-rwsrwxr-x   1 root        94484 Oct  2  1995 /usr/openwin/bin/xlock

Note that the two are quite different is size and that the Sun version is
suid root. I have no idea what the actual differences are. The source
for xlock comes with the standard X11 distribution which can be found at
ftp.x.org, amoung other places.

I put xlock on my button bar, along with a swallowed xclock:

*FvwmButtons Lock       lock.xpm   Exec xlock -mode flame &
*FvwmButtons ""  clock_3d.xpm   Swallow "xclock" Exec xclock -bg LightGray
-padding 0 &

Thanx for your reply, but my sysadmin and I figured out the problem. Well,
he did, I was just watching :) In any case, it seems that a required env.
variable is not being set during xdm startup... the env name is LOGNAME
... Once this is set properly, it will work just fine... Thanx!

It is more an Xwindows question, but I will put a fvwm specific bend on it :-)

Yes you can ... 

  There is a program called xcb that can help you manage you cut buffer.
It can do a number of things including display all of the active cut
buffers in a window, as well as put things in the cut buffer, and spit the
output of the the cut buffer to stdout.  

  I added a patch that merges these two last into 1 execution, which copies
the currently highlighted text into the cut buffer, then spits it out to
stdout.  (If you want that version please let me know, I will make the src
available).   If you are using normal xcb, replace "xcb -P 0" with 
"xcb -S 0; xcb -p 0".

  I put the following line in my .fvwm2rc

Mouse	1	W	M	Exec netscape `xcb -P 0` &

  Note that for me netscape is a perl program that will invoke netsape
optionally with the -remote openURL option.  You can get similar
functionality (assuming netscape is already running) with the binding

Mouse	1       W	M	Exec url=`xcb -P 0` ; netscape -remote "openURL($url,new-window)" &

He's right, except his memory has failed him a bit.  It's LOGNAME, not
USER that's the problem.  I have my .profile (which I source in my
.xsession) set up like this:

[...Lots of irrelevant stuff...]
LOGNAME=${USER-`whoami`}
USER=${USER-$LOGNAME}

export LOGNAME USER
[...Lots more irrelevant stuff...]

This way $LOGNAME and $USER are both guranteed to be set ($USER is
needed for some other programs and while one can generally expect
login to set it, I'm paranoid about these things :-)

If you want to get the latest xlock, it's available from ftp.x.org
somewhere in the contrib area.  I think applications, but it might be
utilities.

Go to the FVWM page and look for FvwmIconMan; I don't use it and it is not
part of the normal FVWM distribution (as far as I know), but I think
that it can be swallowed into a button bar to much the same effect.

Add in a clock and a menu and ta ra! your fvwm95 taskbar.

I have managed to get FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan to work together to
create a rather nice task bar (complete with Start Menu, task area,
and "System Tray").  My setup is a bit peculiar, since I use "rstart"
to manage differences in programs/paths etc.  between Digital Unix,
SunOS 4.1.3, AIX, Linux...  but I'm happy to explain:

1.  This example assumes a 1280x1024 screen... make necessary
    adjustments for other resolutions.

2,  You need to define three major buttons for FvwmButtons:
	*FvwmButtons(2x1, NoSize, Icon mini-exp.xpm Title(Side) Start, \
		Action 'Menu StartMenu Nop')
	*FvwmButtons(32x1, Size 1024 18, Padding 0 0, \
		Swallow "FvwmIconMan" "FvwmIconMan")
	*FvwmButtons(6x1, NoSize, Frame 1, Container(Rows 1, Frame 0))
	  *FvwmButtons(Icon mini-lock.xpm,  Action 'Menu LockMenu Nop')
	  . . .
	*FvwmButtons(End)

    The first entry (2x1) is the Start Menu and should be simple to
    understand.

    The second entry (32x1) is the Task Bar (the configuration of
    which I will supply in the next step, below).

    The third entry (6x1) is a "container" button that holds nine
    mini-icons for use as a system tray.  I put things like a
    "Restart" and "Stop Fvwm" icon here.  Note that I do not use
    "Titles" in the system tray.

3.  You need to configure FvwmIconMan as follows:

    *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers		1
    *FvwmIconMan*background		#c0c0c0
    *FvwmIconMan*foreground		black
    *FvwmIconMan*drawicons		true
    *FvwmIconMan*format			"%t"
    *FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry		1024x18
    *FvwmIconMan*managergeometry	1x1
    *FvwmIconMan*drawicons		true
    *FvwmIconMan*resolution		global
    *FvwmIconMan*followfocus		true
    *FvwmIconMan*focusbutton		down black #c0c0c0
    *FvwmIconMan*focusandselectbutton	down black #e0e0e0
    *FvwmIconMan*selectbutton		up black #e0e0e0
    *FvwmIconMan*dontshow		class=FvwmButtons resource=FvwmPager

    *FvwmIconMan*action     		Mouse   1 N sendcommand Focus, \
	    sendcommand "Iconify -1"
    *FvwmIconMan*action     		Mouse   2 N sendcommand "Iconify 1"
    *FvwmIconMan*action     		Mouse   3 N sendcommand "Iconify"

    (One line is split for display purposes, don't split it in your
    .fvwm2rc).

    There's a bug in fvwm (not IconMan) that prevents me from putting
    a "Window Ops" type menu bound to Mouse button 3.  Maybe this will
    be fixed sometime; until then, I have MB3 simply toggle the
    iconified state.

4.  Restart fvwm2 and enjoy your task bar.  Note that you may need to
    play with the font resources in FvwmIconMan and FvwmButtons (I've
    omitted those for sake of brevity) to get the exact look and feel
    that you want.  Additionally, you will want to ensure you have the
    latest (post 2.0.45) version of FvwmIconMan, which has a fix for
    task bars > 1000 pixels.  (Otherwise, look for the magic number
    '1000' in your FvwmIconMan sources and change it to '1024' as a
    temporary fix.)

5.  Fiddle with the button sizes if you wish a larger or smaller
    system tray.  It's unfortunate that FvwmButtons cannot be made to
    dynamically size the FvwmIconMan portion depending on the size of
    the system tray.  The formula I used is 32 x 40 = 1280... I
    divided the button bar into 40 32-pixel sections and sized things
    within it.  Note the use of 'NoSize' to prevent FvwmButton for
    determining sizes for itself.

Hi there!

I'm fiddling with several desks. I have added this to my .fvwm2rc file:

Key Left A C -1 0
Key Right A C 1 0

This will enable me to move between desktops with the left/right keyboards.

Imagine the scenery with 2 desktops and the configuration above. 
This allows me to move past the configured 2 desktops.

How do I limit this? I have looked in the the manual and haven't found any
thing that can help me..


Help!!

Markus, I've been using your patch for the past couple of weeks and it seems
solid.  I fail to see the functionality of the code above (the code that was
essentially excluded), yet I'm not too familiar with the internals of Fvwm
either.

Alas, will this patch make it in the next release (if not, could we get
something IN that will insure FlipFocus' functionality when used in
conjunction with MouseFocus) ? 

NOTE: the above patch applies to fvwm-2.0.45

I reckon it'll be LOGNAME not set properly - try

   LOGNAME=$USER export LOGNAME

in your .xsession.  If it works, persuade your sysadmin to put it in
the default Xsession.

Under 2.0.45, Button #2 disappears when an application (e.g. Netscape)
spawns a window.  All other windows/xterms are fine.


 I have the following ButtonStyles in my .fvwm2rc file

    # Standard X
    ButtonStyle 1 17 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 \
                     80x30@0 60x50@0 80x70@1 80x80@0 70x80@0 \
		     50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 \
		     20x30@0 20x20@1
    # Nested Right Angles (looks nice)
    ButtonStyle 2 14 0x0@1 0x20@1 20x20@0 20x0@0 0x0@1 0x25@1 \
                     25x25@1 25x0@1 55x0@1 55x55@0 0x55@0 0x60@1 \
		     60x60@1 60x0@1

    Style "*" Color White/DimGray, WindowListSkip, NoHandles, \
              DecorateTransient, BorderWidth 3


NOTE: the "\" above is used for better readability only.

 Easiest way to replicate what I'm seeing is while using Netscape; click on
 'File->Save As...' which will spawn a query window prompting the user for a 
 file name to use and directory location (the window name is "Save As..." ).
 That query window will get created only with button-1.

Why does button-2 disappear ??

I am running fvwm2-2.45 on HPUX 10.10. I have the following error
message in my .xsession-errors file.

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /##########################################################################
No such file or directory

Does anyone know what this means or how I can fix the problem? This
occurs whenever I restart the window manager.


Second, I have also notice a small problem with Auto Wraparound. The
problem is that when I hightlight/copy line of text that is wrapped to
more than one line (i.e. not carriage returns in the line except at the
very end) and then go to paste it in another window, extra carriage
returns are put in the pasted text at the point where the original
highlighted text is wrapped to the next screen line. (The xterm window
has Auto Wraparound set by default.)

This only happens after some time of using fvwm2. If exit fvwm2, login
and start fvwm2 again, everything is fine. I am using ksh. Would using
the input buffer for ksh have anything to do with this? Anyone have
any ideas about this?

Hi, someone suggested using the Afterstep distribution clock, and after
a look at their screenshop (sorry whoever it is, your name escapes me!
Cool 'convert your fvwm2 setup' script by the way, pity it broke my
machine! The m4 line in the .fvwmrc file isn't checked for fvwm2rc
vs some other name...took me a while to spot it. Where was I? Oh yes...)
I decided that this was a good thing.


I went to http://afterstep.edoc.com/#Download and downloaded 
Afterstep-1.0pre5.tar.gz hoping to steal the clock (which is
very nice looking). Unfortunately I keep getting an
unexpected EOF when gunzipping it. Now, the site _is_ slow
from my locale and one of two things is happening:
(1) Netscape is bailing out without telling me. Unlikey.
(2) The file they're supplying is 'broken'

Does anyone know of an alternate place to get this file or
does anyone have just the clock (reaching a bit I know)?
If someone has a 'working' tarfile as a result of reading
the same message yesterday would they please stick it on their
ftp/www area for a while and mail me. Cheers!

My friend Paul (an as-of-yet non-FVWM user) asks:

  I was wondering if there was something like "fvwmclient" which would
  allow you to call those functions from the command line.  So you could
  write a little wrapper script like:

  #!/bin/sh
  emacsclient $1
  fvwmclient 'Focus Emacs ; WarpToWindow Emacs'

Is there a way that, whenever he opened a file with emacsclient (a small
app which communicates with an already-running emacs and instructs that
instance of emacs to open the passed file) fvwm would raise/de-iconify the
emacs window and warp to it?

We're running FVWM 2.0.45 on SunOS and X11R5.

Then the next time I open a new application, the win manager
crashes. This problem happens  after a certain period of time. 
I looked at the PID, it corresponds to the fvwm process.
I am running solaris2.5 on my sparc5. It happens with both
openwin or X11R6. And I have 64Meg of RAM.
	The fvwm is great. But this problem has been bugging me
for a long time. Please help me to find out what is the problem.


thnx
Andrew

The afterstep clock is known as asclock. It's pretty small (~30K). you can
find it most anywhere, but you can try sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/*

Here's what I did:

  edit your fvwm/icon.c

Remove the lines which check for an application providing its own pixmap,
and an application providing its own icon window. Just leave in the lines
which say to check for a user-supplied (in .fvwm2rc) pixmap.

What happens now is that apps which provide their own pixmaps (e.g. XV)
get ignored. Apps which don't provide any icons (e.g. xterm) are
unaffected. Then you have to put something like

  Style "*" default_icon.xpm

in your .fvwm2rc (provide one for each app..)

It sucks, I know, that's why I don't use this solution, but it does work.

Hello:

I have finally finished FvwmCDE 0.1; it is a module for fvwm-2.0.45 that
duplicates as closely as possible the look-and-feel (but not
functionality, unfortunately..) of the Common Desktop Environment.

The Web page (and a screenshot) is at:

  http://gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph/~orly/FvwmCDE/

You can also get the distribution there (860KB, which is a full source
tree of fvwm-2.045 with my minor patches, plus FvwmCDE itself). You will
also need XForms version 0.84 or 0.85 (the latter preferred) from:

  ftp://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/pub/xforms/test/

There is no documentation as of yet, but I have included a (hopefully
self-explanatory) fvwm2rc. Also, you can wreak wonders on your desktop
with FvwmCDE if you get yourself Kiwi's AfterStep icon collection. I am
using FvwmCDE currently on a 24-bit SGI workstation, and it consumes even
_less_ memory than 4Dwm, plus all Indigo Magic apps still work. And it
looks kewl  :)

Please note the following bugs:

  - startup is slow (have to work on my parser)
  - the parser is fragile; it's supposed to handle embedded pixmap
    filenames like "Net%NetscapeLogo.xpm%scape" but I haven't tested
    this yet.. however, the canonical "Netscape%NetscapeLogo.xpm%"
    works fine.. so don't try to break it!! :)
  - it crashes sometimes when minimized; I don't know if this is an
    FvwmCDE bug or an XForms bug (version 0.85 is a test version)

If there are anymore bugs, please mail me.

Thanks, and enjoy!

Hello:

 I've built FvwmCDE on IRIX 5.3 with XForms-0.85 and it bombs on startup.
So a note for those people who want to use FvwmCDE on SGI boxen: use your
stock IDO CC, _not_ GCC. I don't know what's causing this, but the
executable built with GCC always SIGSEGV's mysteriously while parsing,
while that compiled with the IDO works fine.

 Thanks (see, I already found a bug :)

I just installed the new 2.0.45 version and seems like the FvwmForm does not
work anymore.  All I have showing up is the window with all widgets' background
drawn but not managed, cannot select any buttons and not text is showing up.
All I can do is 'destroy' the window.

Any clue on what's going on?

PS: I have tested also the FvwmScript with some scripts (like ScreenSetup) and
I get the same behavior. So it does not seem to be an FvwmForm problem (???).


Thanks in advance...

Sorry all, but seems like my fvwm has gotten confused by restarting too many
time.  I was testing the Title and Button Style and restarted fvwm quite
often.  I logged out and back in and everything was fine.

Thank you for your time and sorry again!

PS: Still fvwm seems to lose its temper when you 'Restart' it too often!? Chuck?

I also recently installed 2.0.45 (from 1-something)... I was pleasantly
surprised at how well the FvwmForm "rlogin" worked. No troubles here...
What type of machine are you on? Have you tried the sample Forms, or are
you using a custom Form that you wrote?

Markus,

I've been using the patch you wrote, and it seems to work well.  I
hope this effect can be incorporated somehow into the standard FVWM.

Actually, it appears I do. I had just been trying the clock since I
thought it would be easy. But trying to swallow FvwmIconMan, again
copying from my linux setup, doesn't work either. Buttons are allocated
at the right size, but nothing shows up.  oclock doesn't work either.

There are a couple of other weird things going on. A couple of the
xpm icons I use for the buttons don't work. They just don't show up,
even though the button works. I've got a dozen other icons that
do show up. I don't think it's a colormap problem since one of the
icons is greyscale, and if I commment out all of the buttons except that
one it still doesn't show up. Shows up on my other computers though.

None of this is a huge deal, I just tend to spend time (too much time ;-)
tweaking my fvwm set up, and was curious about why some stuff worked on one
system and not the other.

FvwmCDE-m is nice, I mentioned it in the FvwmCDE webpage. But the main
thing I hate about FvwmCDE-m is that it's Tcl/Tk based. And thus eats
memory like there was no tomorrow.. :)

Personally I prefer C-language based ones (like FvwmCDE!! :) which are in
my experience both faster and less memory-consuming than Tcl/Tk based
programs..

We're running fvwm95-2.0.43a on both a linux box with XFree86, and on an
IBM RS/6000 running AIX, and with autoraise enabled, see an annoying
bug:  The pull-down menu buttons will suddenly by "unautoraised" (ie.
they disappear behing the main window).  A second press of the pull-down
menu works fine.  This behavior occurs about 75% of the time.  I also
see the problem with a pulldown from within the middle of a window in
code I have written.  We have compiled the fvwm code and module with
debug info on, and have a fabulous source-level debugger to use in
debugging the problem, and I was wondering if someone could fill me in
as to what the code design was/is, and where to start looking.  Some
specific questions, why does the Autoraise module get a message packet
when a pull-down menu is 'raised'?  

In the FAQ there is a similar sounding problem where the answer is:

>Known problem.  The window is being raised over the
>override_redirect window that is being used to display the menu.
>Be sure the window is raised before you click on the menubar. 

What do you mean by "Be sure the window is raised before... "  The main
window is the only one on the screen.  Pressing the pulldown button
causes the pulldown to appear, then suddenly disappear (i.e. go behind
the main window)....

Anyway, I'm willing to help if you can give me some hints where to
start.

Well, I have only heard from one person thus far about the initial alpha. I
don't know how many people are looking at this API, but if you are I could use
some feedback. If no one is yet, I can make the proposed changes without
remorse! :-)

If you are not a Perl programmer, you won't be interested in the rest of this..

There are two major changes I am considering for alpha-2. The first is in
the parameters that get sent to packet handler routines. Currently, the list
is the packet type followed by three or more args, depending on the packet
type. In this current means, there is no way for a packet to have access to
the X11::Fvwm object itself, unless (a) the object is a global variable, or
(b) the handler is created as a closure (an anonymous subroutine), and as
such you can refer to the object, since it will be visible to the lexical
scope of the closure. I don't like (a). A big part of the reason for doing
this object-oriented is to avoid a glut of globals within the package itself,
so I'm not about to advocate that programmers using my API use globals if they
don't want. As for (b), well, it's not a bad thing, really. But it is not my
place to dictate to the programmer that all packet handlers be closures. Plus,
if I do, then it hamstrings my efforts to develop X11::Fvwm::Defaults.pm, a
collection of simple default packet handlers for packets such as M_ERROR
(without Tk, it uses Perl's carp() to report the error, which includes a
subroutine-trace for debugging aid. Under Tk, would pop up a dialog reporting
the error and giving the user choice of Quit or Continue). Since these pre-
defined routines would not be closures, I can't rely on the scoping to give
me access to either an X11::Fvwm instance, or a Tk object instance.

Which leads in to the second issue. Rather than having the X11::Fvwm class
looking specifically for Tk to be loaded (or defaulting to a simpler event
loop), I find that it might be better to separate the Tk hooks from the general
Fvwm API code. That is, the routine/method X11::Fvwm::eventLoop should only
be running the simple loop. I think it better to have X11::Fvwm::Tk as a 
subclass. The subclass would then define eventLoop to be the Tk one. It would
also have an extra instance variable, for tracking the Tk object that acts as
a TopLevel for this application (so that event handlers such as M_ERROR have
a Tk object from which to derive Dialog boxes, etc). What would this gain?
Well, the one response I did get to my posting of the alpha version was someone
interested in using X11::Fvwm, but would rather use the Perl interface to
XForms instead of Tk. Under this proposed model, that would be as easy as
writing X11::Fvwm::XForms.pm.

I haven't gotten that much feedback about my Python FVWM module
either.  I just suspect that there aren't that many (new) module
writers out there.

no, no, no!  there's no patching of fvwm necessary to override most
builtin icons; all you have to do (except for aggressive apps such as
exmh) is (for example):

	Style "Netscape"	Icon "3d/netscape.xpm"
	Style "xv"		Icon "3d/xv-color.xpm"

then fvwm magically uses the icon you specify instead of the one
provided by the app.

There are actually two problems involved. 
1. FvwmForm and FvmwScript have a hardcoded '32' in the select() call in their
   MainLoop. If fvwm assigns a file descriptor >31 they won't be able to
   detect messages from fvwm and that will lead to the described behavior 
   (not managed, no buttons etc.). This one is easy to fix: use the the 
   result of GetFdWidth() instead of '32' as all the other modules do.
   Attached are patches for FvwmForm.c und FvwmScript.c which do just that.
2. The 'Restart' problem. This one is strange and it'll need someone with
   better knowledge of the internals of fvwm than me to solve. fvwm 2.0.45
   running on a Sparc Station under Solaris (what kind of machine are you
   on, Benoit?) will 'loose' one (or two) file descriptor(s) every time it 
   is restarted. Take a look at the file descriptors fvwm assigns to its 
   modules ('ps' shows the command lines fvwm uses to start modules). 
   With my setup the Pager will get 
   - 14 and 10 when started, 
   - 15/11 after the first restart, 
   - 16/13 (notice 13-11=2!) after the second restart, 
   - 17/14 after the third 
   and from there on it will go up in steps of one (at least I think it does, 
   I didn't actually check every step but eventually it reaches 32 and the 
   problem becomes obvious to me since I'm using a FvwmForm dialog to restart).
   Even stranger is that fvwm compiled from the same source and using the
   same .fvwm2rc running under SunOS 4.1.3 doesn't have this problem. There
   I get 9 and 6 for the pager and that stays the same no matter how often
   I restart. 
   Actually, this bug(?) is not really an important one. AFAIK most OS'es 
   will allow at least 256 file descriptor per process, so after fixing 
   FvwmForm and FvwmScript (hopefully newly written modules will always use 
   GetFdWidth()) one would have to restart more than 200 times to see an
   effect.

I suspect that most people believe it's an extremely advanced subject.  I
don't believe it is, but perhaps some good example code would help.  I
think something like FVWMTile would be a great thing to clone.

I'd really like to play with the Perl module but I just don't have any free
time as I'm currently embroiled in rewriting Majordomo.

Hi, 
	I don't know how many of you checked out the rc's I mentioned
URL's for, but on one of them, I packaged everything as a self installing
shell script. I did it because I wanted to try to do something functional
with shell scripting (I'm sorta new at this :) Anyway, it seemed someone
was very impressed with the idea of downloading a script that was self
contained and installed all the necessary stuff. He suggested I submit it
as a sample config for the distribution, but somehow I doubted this would
actually happen. It did however give me an idea for a homepage... 

	The one thing that this person liked was that you see the config,
download the script, and it installs.... No figitting with settings, etc,
etc... It would take the hassle out of trying out someone's available
.fvwm2rc ... The idea that a user can look through a bunch of "looks" and
then pick and install one that they liked without too much trouble is
actually kinda cool. I was wondering if maybe someone would like to try
and start up an FVWM Easy Config homepage. 
	Basically, the idea would be that a user could go to the homepage,
see enough of a screen capture to get an idea (no ghastly 1280x1024 jpegs
that take 10 years to download), download a script and voila! An easy
install. I would do this myself but I don't have the time. I have
converted both of my configurations into this installation script format
and they're both available at:

	http://www.fiu.edu/~kvarga01/computing/linux

If anyone wants to actually see what I'm talking about by an easy install.
I'f anyone would like to work on this and coordinate this or talk about
it... let me know...
			-peace

Could I have a look at your .fvwmrc please? FvwmButtons has
always been a bit fussy in my experience (I've only ever used
FVWM on a SPARC 5 with Solaris 2.4 and 2.5) andsmall things make
all the difference sometimes.

Ah, well, I think we all do that :)

I haven't downloaded the actual script, but I like the web page and the
look of some of the desktops. Two ideas or questions. 1) I'd like to see
a link to the text of the rc itself. I often see something that looks
neat, and wonder how to do it myself. I don't necessarily want the whole
.rc file, just a part, or just an idea from it. It'd be easier to have
a link that just shows me the file, rather than downloading the entire
script and then paging through it.

2) Have you looked into doing this with rpms? I've never written them,
but it might be a useful way to do this.

Hmmm, I thought about this, and I guess maybe I should do this. Consider
it done :)

Well, I thought about that, but not everyone in the world uses an rpm
capable system... A nice simple shell script seemed like the best lowest
common denominator. Besides... I don't really like RPM :)

I would like to report the following "bug" with FvwmCpp and FvwmM4:
The man pages are out of date w.r.t. fvwm2.

In particular, the man pages indicate that the respective modules can
be invoked as follows:

	fvwm -f /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/FvwmCpp

	fvwm -f "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwmrc"

Well, this is hooey in fvwm2.  The correct form is only (and
fortunately) stated in the main fvwm2 man page as:

	fvwm -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

(and likewise for FvwmCpp).

Hello,

I've just built and installed 2.0.45 on Digital UNIX V4.0 and I've
noticed something a bit weird:

All windows titles work properly with one exception:
the DECterm titles have "1]" prefixed to them, so if the title in
the DECterm config says "DECterm", I get "1]DECterm" and so on.
If I change it to "huhu" using an escape sequece, it changes to
"1]huhu".

any ideas?

Please mail me if you can help: urban@rto.dec.com.

I am trying to use fvwmiconman v 0.9.7a, but I have one small
problem.  FvwmIconMan, when compiling complains about not finding
fvwm.tmpl.

Care to tell me what fvwm.tmpl is and why I need it?

If it makes a difference, I'm running fvwm 2.0.45 and the version of
FvwmIconMan that comes with it works fine. 

Thanks for your help

I'm also running fvwm 2.0.44 on DU 4.0b and noticed this. I've patched 
the sources to avoid this problem (not a pretty patch, though but it 
works). Another problem under DU 4.0b is the "FvwmButtons eating 100% CPU
time after log-out" problem. I'm using fvwm as the window manager along
with the DU session manager. This apparently just kills the X server when
logging out without notifying fvwm. Some FVWM modules have a bug then
which causes them to keep running and eating 100% CPU time. I also have a
fix for that.

If you're interested, just drop me a line.

Maybe the escape sequences for DECterm differ subtly from xterm.  It
looks like a bit of control has leaked into the text.  I set my xterm
title to machine:pwd by tweaking the cd command.  The od command can
display what is going on.

cd . | od -c
    
0000000 033   ]   0   ;   n   e   m   o   :   /   u   s   r   /   p   e
0000020   o   p   l   e   /   g   s   e   z   0   2   0 007
0000035

The third character should be 0, 1 or 2 to set the title on the
window, icon or both.  Perhaps your sequence has an extra "1]" in it.

I'm not on this list so pardon if this has already come up ...
Also make sure to cc me.  I have a hotkey sequence (M-S-F9) in FVWM
that I've successfully bound to a button click using the a2x program
(I need this so that I can have a foot pedal that clicks the mouse).
But ... it doesn't work when the keyboard is grabbed (e.g. a menu
is popped up).  I know it's possible for an X window manager
to override grabs; can FVWM do it (possibly with patches)?

In your 2.0.45 source tree, go to the extras directory and build
FvwmCommand.  I use it all the time.  It works almost exactly as you
describe your theoretical fvwmclient.

That's an artifact from the DECWindows applications that you are
running:  I see it when I run dxcalendar, but not when running "normal"
X applications like tcl/tk, xterm, Netscape, etc.  Since the calendar is
the only program that I currently run that exhibits this behavior, I
tend to simply ignore the problem.

Of course, this isn't a SOLUTION, just another person that noticed this
problem.  I recall somebody mentioning it on this list a few months
ago... but searching the FVWM archives at http://hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/
didn't seem to locate the message (I searched for 'title' in all
messages in 1996 and 1997 and surprisingly, it told me that there were
no matches).

"Fvwm.tmpl" (note the capitalization) is a file needed to compile
fvwm.  It comes in the fvwm-*.tar.gz file and unpacks into the main
directory (where you find README and INSTALL, too).

Did you unpack FvwmIconMan-*.tar.gz into the modules subdirectory of
the fvwm source tree?  If not, try to move it there then just do a
recompilation of fvwm -- the new FvwmIconMan is a plugin replacement
for the old module that's already there.

Hi,

I recently changed from t(v)twm to fvwm2 and now I'm wondering
how it can be that such an extremely usefull feature like twm's
relative resize has been forgotten :-?
Twm is more open-minded than fvwm in not dictating the user where
to go with his mouse-pointer when he wants to resize a window.

Here's an excerpt from twm's manual page describing
  AutoRelativeResize
    This variable indicates that dragging out a window
    size (either when initially sizing the window with
    pointer Button2 or when resizing  it)  should  not
    wait  until  the  pointer  has  crossed the window
    edges.  Instead, moving the pointer  automatically
    causes  the  nearest  edge or edges to move by the
    same amount.  This allows the resizing of  windows
    that  extend  off  the edge of the screen.  If the
    pointer is in the center of the window, or if  the
    resize  is  begun  by  pressing a titlebutton, twm
    will still wait for the pointer to cross a  window
    edge  (to prevent accidents).  This option is par-
    ticularly useful for people who  like  the  press-
    drag-release  method of sweeping out window sizes.


So what do you think?

I noticed that it isn't in fvwm, but I don't miss it.  Maybe this is
because, in W context, I have bound a mouse button to do resize.  In
particular:

,-----
| Mouse 3 WFSIT   4       Resize-or-Maximize
`-----

Where Resize-or-Maximize is the following function:

,-----
| AddToFunc Resize-or-Maximize	"M" Resize

Hello,

I recently installed fvwm2 on my linux. To config the window, I need to know
all the commands and descriptions so that I can write my own .fvwm2rc file. Do
you recommand a source to find these descriptions? I am not very skillful yet
at this moment that perhaps why I could not easily relate some sample 
 .fvwm2rc file and their corresponding screen behavior. I seem need some more
descriptions than samples. 

Thanks.

One of the things I've found to be missing from any X window manager I've
tried is the MS Windows way of window focus switching.  For those of you
who are not familiar, I will explain: 

Windows "A B C D E" are open (not necessarily visible)

Window "A" is in focus

User switches from Window "A" to Window "B"

Window list looks like "B A C D E"

User switches from Window "B" to Window "E"

Window list "E B A C D"

The point is that the previously used window becomes the second item in
the window list.  This makes it very convenient to switch between two
windows without having to cycle through all of them (which seems to be
the case in all window managers I've used).

I am curious if anybody has implemented this in fvwm2 and if not, could
somebody direct me to the place in the code where I could find the
handling of the keyboard window focus changing?  I'd like to take a stab
at this myself if it's not too difficult.

Thanks.

Mike.

Having gotten tired of always going through a menu of choices to get to the
"Window Ident" option, I designed a button-style I could bind to FvwmIdent:

ButtonStyle 5 13 25x20@1 75x20@1 75x38@0 60x38@0 60x62@0 75x62@1 75x80@0 \
	25x80@0 25x62@1 40x62@1 40x38@1 25x38@0 25x20@1

(spacing is for readability only, of course).

It's a stylized "I" that is the 3rd button in my left grouping (button 1 brings
up my menu of window operations, and button 3 brings up a transient window list
(my Perl/Tk windowlist, in this case)).

don't remember who, but someone recently posted about a title-bar button

figure out which button number to use; this one's button 3, the second
one from the edge on the lefthand side of the title-bar):

ButtonStyle 3 20 50x35@0 40x25@0 50x15@0 60x25@1 50x35@1 50x40@1

If you use ClickToFocus you get this behavior.  ClickToFocus is also the
way focus in done in MS Windows.  To use ClickToFocus add the style line:

Style "*"           ClickToFocus

To have a key that works like Alt+Tab, create a binding like:

Key F8          A       N       Prev [] FlipFocus

The feature that is distinctly missing is the MS Windows behavior when
you hit and hold Alt, hit Tab multiple times, and release Alt.  Something
close can be achived with:

Key F8          A       S       Prev [] Focus

The problem with this is that it does not reorder the window list, so the
result will not always be what you expect.  If anyone has any idea how to
do this, let me know.  I would be willing to do the programming.

Hope that helps,

Dan Niles

One could use the window list for that, even though it's more like
Ctrl-Esc or Alt-Esc or whatever calls the task list.  But I think
selecting a window from the window list doesn't reorder the windows,
either, does it?

Yes, I would agree that the window list more resembles the task list in
Windows.  I simply want a method of switching between open windows in a
somewhat methodical manner as I outlined in my posting.  I have been
advised of the flip-focus feature, but have yet to try it.  Apparently, it
won't do exactly what I want but close.  I think I may start coding...

In the fvwm2 man page, the line following .SH NAME must read as follows:

     .SH NAME
     fvwm2 \- F(?) Virtual Window Manager for X11


It was simply "fvwm" and thus catman creates an incorrect windex entry.

Check your styles that apply to the pager.  if clicktofocus is part of the
styles, autoraise won't work on it until you remove that, I think.

In my quest to get all the M_* packets documented for my Perl module, I have
been hunting down M_WINDOWSHADE and M_DEWINDOWSHADE.

These packets are sent when a window toggles between shaded states (duh), 
assuming that you enabled shading at build-time. However, these packets don't
really conform to the established standard. Each packet contains only one
value, which looks like the X window ID.

So, why not have these packets return the same identifying triple that
packets like M_LOWER_WINDOW, M_DESTROY_WINDOW, etc. have, or that longer
packets like M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW use as their first three args to identify a
window?

(the code is in builtins.c)

Upon consideration, it was pretty cheesy of me to say "I've done all the
tracking work, up to the point of changing code. Even though I know exactly
where the change needs to be, someone else do it."

So attached is a patch to builtins.c that causes the M_WINDOWSHADE and
M_DEWINDOWSHADE packets to transmit 3 values instead of one. The three
values are X Win ID, Frame X Win ID, and Fvwm ID. These are a very standard
triple. Apply with patch -p, from the fvwm sub-dir of your distribution:

This makes my xclock and FvwmPager both AutoRaise - which suggests that
both are not quite ICCCM compliant.

Thanks folks.

I seems that most people do not want to switch to ClickToFocus mode,
just in order to get a working version of FlipFocus. In current
releases of Fvwm the handling of the window history is broken, when
used in conjunction with MouseFocus. A complete and satisfying bug-fix
is rather difficult, but if all you care for is FlipFocus, then you
can use the patch that I posted a little while ago:

The code that I excluded does not seem to fulfil any purpose. I
imagine that it is probably left over from earlier development cycles
and I decided to leave it in the comments, so that whoever wrote this
part of the code could comment on it (if neccessary).

I have no idea what I need do to officially get my patch included into
newer versions of Fvwm. The two of you, are the only people who have
commented on my code and both of you confirm that it works for you and
does not have any undesirable side-effects, so I _think_ including it
into the official release would be a good idea.

Whom do I need to lobby? Chuck, can you hear me :-)


Markus

P.S.:  N.B. this bug-fix does _not_ fix all of the problems that are
       related to the window history when used in conjunction with
       MouseFocus, but it ensures that FlipFocus works as expected. A
       full bug-fix would be considerably more difficult (at least,
       that conclusion is suggested by a first inspection of the
       current code.)

I use the pager that is included with TkGoodStuff to navigate my virtual
screens.  I've noticed that when switching to a page with the pager, one of the
windows on the screen is automatically raised.  This can get rather annoying,
I'd rather only raise windows myself.  Any idea how to disable this?

Hello

I'm trying to compile fvwm2 to work on my solaris machine. I've made
changes to the Fvwm.tmpl so that gcc will be used. When I compile I get
the following message

oldgold:fvwm-2.0.45 > make

Current working directory
/home/erahkgn/.netscape/download/program/fvwm-2.0.45/libs
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'

I'veread the FAQ on this issue and I've contacted the system admin. They
are unwilling to help with compilation of public domain programs. Is it
perhaps possible to have a personal configuration of imake? If it is how
is it achieved? Is there perhaps some way to edit the Fvwm.tmpl and the
configure.h files so that a compilation will be successful?

I am thankful for all the help a I can get.

You didn't complete the configuration of Imake for Gcc.  You need to
change the compiler options, too.  I've put a file on our FTP server
with the Imake we use for Solaris 2.5.

Hello

I finaly mannaged to compile fvwm2 with gcc under Solaris. I had to
manualy edit all the Makefiles to get to gcc flags correct. Now I have
another problem.

When I type 'make install' I get the following message

oldgold:fvwm-2.0.45 > make install
installing in ./libs...
install in ./libs done
installing in ./fvwm...
install in ./fvwm done
installing in ./modules/FvwmAudio...
install -c   FvwmAudio /home/erahkgn/lib/fvwm2
cp: /home/erahkgn/lib/fvwm2: is a directory
install: cp /home/erahkgn/lib/fvwm2 FvwmAudio/fvwm2 failed 
*** Error code 2

*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'
oldgold:fvwm-2.0.45 > 

What do I do to det fvwm2 installed?

I copied the sample.fvwm2rc file to my .fvwm2rc and the fvwm2 fiel to my
bin directory so I can run fvwm2 but I have problems with the icons and
the modules.

Thank's in advance
/Henrik

Well, I updated the official page, but i would be nice of the author of the
page in question would at least point to the proper FTP site.  The only
thing still left at spcot.sanders.com is an ancient prerelease of version
2.

Is there any way to force a window to start on the same desktop as it's
parent?

I start an application with -xrm '*Desk:6', and I would like all windows
created by this application to start on that same desktop.

I can I can use StartsOnDesk to force all windows of that application to
start on a certan desktop, but I run the same application on multiple
desktops.


Thanks,

There needs to be a way to get Exec to *not* use a shell in the execution; a
way to have it use execv() directly. Working in a heavy mutil-system 
environment, I usually have a lot of xterms running at once, as well as a host
of things spawned by Xdm prior to starting fvwm. After a while, my process
table starts to get dangerously close to full, and my biggest offender are
shells waiting around for their sub-process xterms to complete. If the xterm
is on my local machine, I'm using three processes-- a shell to execute xterm,
xterm itself, and the shell that xterm controls!

from the 'exec' man page

csh
  exec executes command in place of the current shell, which terminates.

using exec to run your commands would kill the only useless process of the
three ... the one waiting for xterm to exit.  Wouldn't it?

That will work, yes, but it seems like Fvwm should prepend "exec" automatically
when processing an Exec command. I understand using a shell (environment
variable expansions, etc.), but you don't expect to be using that top-level
shell for anything afterwards-- why not always use exec?

I have been having users complain that they can't run xlock under xdm with
fvwm2.  I tried it (I don't usually use it) and they're right... I came up
with a work around (xterm -iconic -e xlock &) but I'm curious as to why the
setuid process doesn't work straight out of fvwm's Exec command.

Any ideas?

Are you on a sun, and you missed my sun-xlock thread a week or two ago....
then you have an answer... The variable "LOGNAME" is not set in X by
default. This is required for xlock to work properly. I'm not sure how to
set that in the default system X startup files... but at least now you're
halfway there :)

When I log in and fvwm starts, it starts all of my applications first, then
finally, fvwm.  Since fvwm isn't around to handle the placement of the windows,
I get a big pile of windows in the upper left of my screen.

I realize that I could painstakingly put -geometry into the startup line for
each program, but I was wondering if there's any way to take advantage of the
SmartPlacement function of fvwm.

An acceptable alternative might be a way to tell fvwm to re-place all the
windows on the current screen.

Suggestions?

D'oh!  I remember that thread, and I thought it might be the LOGNAME - but
everytime I tried to echo the logname, it worked.  Then just now I tried it
as a menu command while monitoring the output of the shell fvwm2 is run
in... and sure enough, it was blank.  So, the expected solution:

add the setting and exportation of LOGNAME to the file xdm runs to start up
the windowing session (default /usr/openwin/lib/xdm/Xsession, referenced in
/usr/openwin/lib/xdm/xdm-config, which could be anything depending on
arguments at xdm server execution)

So I put in:

LOGNAME=`whoami`
export LOGNAME

Hey whadaya know... it works!  Isn't it strange how when you try to recreate
problems, they often aren't there?

Anyway, that's the rest of the way there.

David

you can use structures with several commands, then an exec would not ake
sens ... 

eg what should fvwm do to this menu entry ?

+ "netscape (WWW)"      Exec FVB_WWW=${FVB_WWW:-${WEBBROWSER:-'netscape -install'}}; exec ${FVB_WWW} &

cheers
tobi

PS this tries several environment variable to find the users favorite
webbrowser and if its not successfull it uses netscape

You could start Fvwm first then the other programs then a "logout"
client, such as xlogout.  On my University account I do this:

    xconsole -geoemtry -0-0 &
    fvwm &
    xterm &
    ...
    exec xlogout -geometry +0+0

Xlogout is a little program that displays a window with a button in
it.  When you click the button, it terminates.

If the user wants to do more then one action, like

Exec xset s blank ; xset s activate ; xlock ; xset s noblank

If you don't have anything like that you could try
doing:

ExecUseShell sh exec

I'm not sure if it would work, because I'm not sure if fvwm will
look for a shell named sh space exec, or for a shell called sh
and pass it exec and whatever comes on the Exec line.

If you don't mind making your startup fvwm dependent you could
start just fvwm from your .xinitrc (or .xsession), and
use the InitFunction to start all your apps.

If you want a non-fvwm specific solution, and you want exiting
fvwm to end you X session there is still a way.

You can do something more like this in your .xinitrc/.xsessionrc
(NOTE: the delay factors were hand tuned for a Sun3/50 with 4M of
RAM, no disk, X11R3, and twm; they could probbabably be made
smaller!!!):

# Stuff to start before the window manager
xrdb -load -retain $HOME/.Xresources
xconsole -geometry 450x120+0+0 -iconic &

# Set the window manager
TWM=fvwm

# Wait for the console to start
sleep 3

$TWM &
TWMNO=$!

# Wait for the window manager to start
sleep 6

# Now start as much cruft as you like
xload &
repeat 500 xterm &
netscape &

# This waits untill the windows manager exits.  As long as you
# don't add more stuff after it when you exit the window manager
# your X session will end.

Previously, I defined multiple decors for the sake of title styles and color
specifications. In each of the decors, I had the same 5 AddButtonStyle
statements. Only, there were two problems: If I changed a style and re-started,
it overlaid on the current style, so I wanted ButtonStyle instead of
AddButtonStyle. And (2), These 5 styles were redundantly defined, and changing
one meant changing it in several places.

So I added the following:

ButtonStyle 1 5 25x61@0 75x61@0 75x39@0 25x39@1 25x61@1
ButtonStyle 2 4 50x35@1 65x65@0 35x65@0 50x35@1
ButtonStyle 3 13 90x10@1 40x10@1 40x40@1 40x60@1 60x60@0 [ ... ]
ButtonStyle 4 4 50x65@1 35x35@1 65x35@1 50x65@0
ButtonStyle 5 20 50x35@0 40x25@0 50x15@0 60x25@1 50x35@1 [ ... ]

outside of a Decor definition, expecting it to apply universally. But it
doesn't, I get default visual styles for all the buttons. I've tried several
variations (using the Vector keyword, using "--" to mean all states, etc.),
but none work. For now, I'll have to put them back in the Decor definitions,
but what am I doing wrong?

Which supports my argument that there should be an alternate command (Execv,
perhaps) for executions that can safely skip the shell level. :-)

I compiled the new fvwm2 today. I tried to follow the instructions, but
stumbled over a little problem:  Several of the Makefiles produced
contained a referrence to a command called ClearmakeOSName. Which neither
me nor me machine has ever heard of (Linux 2.0.29). 

To continue, I made a little executable and named it ClearmakeOSName:

	#!/bin/sh
	$*

It seemed to work. But clearly, I must be missing something.

'clearmake' is part of the ClearCase configuration management system.
The X consortium recently switched to using it so the imake system that
comes with X11R6 has support for it.

However, if you don't use clearcase, you shouldn't have a problem.

Looks like there's something wrong with your X configuration/setup.

if you don't mind using FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp you can make a definition for
the Button Styles, or make a separate file and m4_include() or #include
it.  here's what i do (extraneous stuff removed for clarity):

# define a Maximize button:
m4_define(<%_BUTTON_MAX_%>, <%2%>)m4_dnl
m4_define(<%_DefaultButtonMax_%>, <%m4_dnl
_ButtonStyle(_BUTTON_MAX_, <%5 75x25@1 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0  75x25@0%>)m4_dnl
%>)m4_dnl
# make it part of the `Default' decor:
_DefaultButtonMax_
#
# ...
#
# now make it part of another decor also:
AddToDecor Smooth
+ _DefaultButtonMax_

note that the above uses "FvwmM4 .fvwmrc -m4-prefix".

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Ahhhh... the last packet to be documented and grokked by my interface... :-)

The packet M_MINI_ICON sends six word/integer values to the recepient:

word	meaning

0	X Window ID
1	X Pixmap ID of the picture
2	X Pixmap ID of the mask
3	Width
4	Height
5	Depth

The problems that jump out at me:

* As with the window-shade packets I pointed to earlier this week, the standard
  3 args are missing from the start of this packet.

* I don't think that either of the X Pixmap IDs (not to be confused with XPMs
  themselves, these can identify either a pixmap *or* a bitmap) are at all
  useful to a module. I don't know how easy it is for an application to get a
  pixmap using only this value. Under a widget library like Tk, I don't know if
  it is even possible. Perhaps for the C-based modules, this can be used. I
  would prefer to see a string, though.

I would propose that the packet look more like:

word	meaning

0	X Win ID
1	Frame X Win ID
2	Fvwm ID
3	Width
4	Height
5	Depth
6+	File name

of course, if the Pixmap ID values are of use, they can be added back in
before the file name.

A quick check shows that the only module using M_MINI_ICON currently is the
FvwmIconMan that comes with Fvwm (I assume the more current version of
FvwmIconMan also uses it).

Fri Mar 28 18:24:21 MST 1997

Version 0.2 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days.

Information, including downloading links, can be found at:

	http://www.byz.org/~randy/perl/X11::Fvwm

Please note that the download links may take a day or two for CPAN sites to
receive the package from PAUSE.

This is the second alpha release. Not all planned features are in, not all
data packet types are yet correctly identified and dissected. The interface
style and overall functionality are still subject to drastic change before
this moves into beta. Changes in this version are list below.

>From the README file for 0.2:

X11::Fvwm version 0.2 (alpha 2)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with the Tk extension as your GUI library!

This requires fvwm 2.0.45 or better, and perl 5.002 or better. It is very
highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk (which is
Tk400.202 as of this writing), also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

CREDITS AND LICENSES

This package is copyright (c) 1997 by Randy Ray (randy@byz.org) and may be
distributed under terms of the Artistic License used to cover Perl itself.
See the file Artistic in the distribution of Perl 5.002 or later for details

>From the Changes file for 0.2:

* Changed the invocation of handlers to include a reference to the X11::Fvwm
  object as the first parameter. Otherwise, handlers have no access to the
  object unless the object is global or the handler is created as a closure.

* Removed the Tk references in Fvwm.pm, so that X11::Fvwm acts as a base
  class for the API. Fvwm/Tk.pm (X11::Fvwm::Tk) now is a subclass of X11::Fvwm
  with the new() and eventLoop() methods overloaded. Also adds one new
  instance variable and a method to access it by. This should simplify adding
  other GUI widget sets, such as Xforms.

* Put in some simple default handlers in Fvwm/Defaults.pm (package
  X11::Fvwm::Defaults), that can be used if they meet the developer's needs.
  So far, only M_ERROR seems to lend itself to such a default handling.

* X11::Fvwm, X11::Fvwm::Tk, X11::Fvwm::Defaults and PerlTkWL are all -w and -T
  clean.

* Makefile.PL now handles the demos as *.PL files, which allows them to be
  extracted by perl itself, which results in an invocation line based on
  the user's configuration of perl.  Also checks for a usable version of
  the Tk extension.

I would recommend the latter

the second may be slightly slower, but nothing anything short of an analyzer
could detect.

>Which one is correct    ? Why ?

The second.

It doesn't use up a process table entry with the shell waiting for the xterm
to exit; there's no need to do this when the exec can launch xterm and
terminate the shell, freeing up the process table entry for other, more
important uses.

The X Pixmap ID's are awesome. This way the server only needs to allocate each
pixmap once, and the modules don't need to go searching for the damn
file. Also this is how fvwm95 does it and they did it first so we might as
stay compatible with it.

FvwmPager has been modified to use it as well. And I believe the FvwmTaskbar
module thingy uses them too.

Hi,

I have just compiled my version of fvwm 2.0.45c using the CDE look-a-like 
announced earlier this week. However, when I resize my windows I do
not get any rubberband to indicate how large or small they will be. 
Likewise if I have opaque move turned off, no outline of the window is
shown when I move it, so it is pretty much guess-work to place it
correctly. How can that be, and what can I do about it ?

  Rasmus

PS: In case it explains anything : I'm running Linux RedHat 4.0 with a
2.0.27 kernel and XFree86 3.2.

I get this also, but on certain background images, I realized that the
color is very pale and almost impossible to see.  Is there a .fvwm2rc
setting for the color of the rubberband?  If not, might one be
incorporated into the next release?

I'm more interested in keeping up with FvwmPager than with Fvwm '95. :-)

I was afraid that this was the case. I can see the need for the Pixmap IDs to
stay in the packet, but I believe we still need the first three arguments to
match the standard, and putting the name at the very end really wouldn't hurt.
There may be other applications besides perl/Tk that can't directly use the
Pixmap ID.

I use tcl/tk for a fvwm2 module (tkgoodstuff), and I too would like to
access mini-icons.  Including the filename in the MINI_ICON packet
would be marvelous.  I've looked into the idea of writing C code to
create a tk image from an X pixmap id, but I don't have the time or
expertise.  Would it be so hard to include the filename?

The setting you are looking for is called XORvalue. I had this problem
after changing to 16bpp (new graphics-card). I set it to 127, but there
may be better values. You have to try it out by yourself (this is, what
the manual-page says).

I really like my OpaqueResize.  :)

This is a very trivial patch that puts back the OpaqueResize code from
1.24r.  It is enabled by putting in .fvwn2rc "GlobalOpts OpaqueResize"

There should be no trouble putting this in the current distribution; it
should be trivial to modify to support per-window opaque resizing after
the "great style rewrite"

Please cc: responses directly to me, since I'm not subscribed to the

So there is a need for the IDs to stay in. I am currently discussing on the
Perl/Tk mailing list the work that would be needed for having the Photo class
(the class from which images are allocated and created) support a new format
that is just creating a bitmap/pixmap from an ID.

The proposed packet should then be:

word	meaning

0	X Win ID
1	Frame X Win ID
2	Fvwm ID
3	Pixmap ID
4	Mask ID
5	Width
6	Height
7	Depth
8+	File name

This would still require that C modules using the M_MINI_ICON packet be
updated, but I think that it is important to have the first three arguments be
consistent with the other packets. Particularly since the Fvwm ID is touted in
several places as a possible database or hash index, due to the guaranteed
uniqueness.

Folks - 

How do I uncompress / unzip these tar files.

I'm familiar with compress and tar, but I've never come across *.gz
files - is this a dos thing ? I know didly about dos (and only a little
bit more about UNIX !).

The system we use mounts our home directory from a server that doesn't
allow you to rlogin into it. 

We then use a number of different machines for different applications.

I want to have a go at setting up fvwm2 (win95 lookalike) - I just use
mwm at the moment which is a bit old and ugly - and I've fallen at the
first hirdle !

Do I need to install anything - I'm just a bog standard Joe without any
root access.

Any suggestions on a good route for beginners ? There are a number of
websites out there - I don't know where to start.

Thanks,

Mick.

     The Dotfile Generator requires Tcl/Tk, but don't let that scare
you, Tcl/Tk compiles on almost every
     machine running X windows.

     Note: that the Dotfile Generator requires at least Tcl 7.4 / Tk
4.0. Here's a link to the source files: Tcl 7.4
     and Tk 4.0

     And for Linux users, here's a precompiled set for X11R6 of Tcl7.5
and Tk 4.1 

Download the Program

     You may download the program from the main site in Denmark, Europe: 
          gzipped tar format (650Kb) 
          compressed tar format(1.1Mb)

Mike,

Look for gunzip (or gzip -d) binary in your /usr/local/bin directory
(or ask your sysadmin).

It's part of GNU's compress tools.

Yehuda.

It's not the fault of my extra BTW  :)
You have to set the XORValue option in your fvwm2rc. I noticed that
the disappearing rubberband happens when you use a 16-bit or 24-bit
display. Set XORValue 255 and you should get your rubber bands back.

I'm trying to install fvwm for the first time - but I'm not sysadmin or root.

I've been through th FAQ's but I couldn't find any answers that look a basic as
my problems !

Thanks for any suggestions ...

I see the following errors when running 'make install'. I guess this is because
the MakeMakefiles script couldn't see the X11 directory, yeah ?

Here's a log file of when I ran ./MakeMakefiles. Do I need to alias or add a

I attempted to set up a link to sort out the problems I saw when running
MakeMakefiles.

Hi!

I working on SunOs with Fvwm 2.45...
But our department is going to migrate to Solaris.

After successfuly instalation Fvwm on Solaris I missed FvwmButtons.
Altrough it's work just nice on SunOs.

What's wrong? I didn't receive neither error messages nor any
notifications...:(

And another problem...

In SunOs I have the Decoration defined like this

### Xterm Decor ###
DestroyDecor XTerm
AddToDecor   XTerm
+ TitleStyle      LeftJustified
+ ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp( Pixmap mini-display.xpm) Inactive ( Pixmap
mini.xterm.xpm )
#+ ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap mini-display.xpm ActiveUp
#+ ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap mini.xterm.xpm ActiveDown
+ ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap win95-close-full.xpm ActiveUp
+ ButtonStyle 4 Pixmap win95-maximize-full.xpm ActiveUp
+ ButtonStyle 6 Pixmap win95-minimize-full.xpm ActiveUp
+ BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+ BorderStyle Inactive -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+ HilightColor blue PaleGreen
+ TitleStyle ActiveUp (VGradient 40 2 PaleGreen 60 #60c0a0 40 #60c0a0) -- flat
+ TitleStyle ActiveDown (VGradient 40 2 PaleGreen 60 #60c0a0 40 #60c0a0) --
flat
+ TitleStyle Inactive (VGradient 40 2 white 60 grey 40 grey) -- flat

Have a look at this line:
+ ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp( Pixmap mini-display.xpm) Inactive ( Pixmap
mini.xterm.xpm )

It doesn't work on Solaris at all!!! Fvwm stopped on this line and doesn't
move.

So this line I replaced to one of commented in Decor definition section.

Why it doesn't work?

I compile the same code on both Solaris and SunOs, what's difference?

Thanks
