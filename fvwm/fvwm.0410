The rpm packages for the latest stable and unstable fvwm versions (released
two hours ago) are available at http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/rpm/

These should theoretically work on RedHat 7/8/9/whatever-it-is-called-now
and Fedora 1/2/3. This page also links to the missing rpms.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This afternoon I played some with the FvwmScript module as
it comes with Fvwm 2.5.11.  I noticed several inaccuracies
in the documentation plus one thing that seems to be a bug.
I have included my notes below.

-- 
Rouben Rostamian

--- errata in the documentation ----------------------------------

1.
In the sentence:

The second part contains instructions whom are executed...

   *** change "whom" to "which"

2.
In the sentence:

Display a menu whom lets user to choose a option.

   *** change "whom" to "which"
   *** change "a option" to "an option"

3.
In the sentence:

Return the string whom is between position int1 and...

   *** change "whom" to "which"

4.
In two places in the man page we have examples with "Case Message of".

   *** change "Message" to "message" in both places because this
       is apparently case-sensitive

5.
Under the "ANATOMY OF A SCRIPT" section, the five parts of a
FvwmScript are defined.  It says: "And the last [that is, the
fifth] part contains the description of widgets."

However under the "MAIN OF A SCRIPT" section, it says: "The second
part of the script contains the description for every widget...".

   *** the "second part" should be "last part".

--- a bug -------------------------------------------------------

It appears that a "for-loop" insists that its lower index be 1.
The following does not work:

     For $i=4 To 9 Do

--- two suggestions for enhancement -----------------------------

1.
Currently we have several Get* functions, such as GetValue,
GetHilight, etc.  A GetIcon is missing.  (GetIcon id) should
return the `Icon' field of a ItemDraw or PushButton widget.

2.
It would be nice to get FvwmScript's variables to be interpreted
in all context.

For instance, if we have:

Init
 Begin
   Set $w=48
  End

then in the definition of the following widget, $w is not recognized:

Widget 3
Property
 Size       $w $w   ##### PROBLEM: we expect $w to be 48 here but it is not
 Position   10 10
 Type       ItemDraw
 Icon       mypixmap.xpm
End

Unfortunately FVWM does not have this feature.

Some users have done clever things to make their FvwmButtons window
look rounded, but alas, that's it.

SCoTT. :)

Hi all,

There are 3 new transparent themes in my collection: Glass, Water, and 
Wine.

There's a screenshot 
<http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm/glass_decor_screen.png>
showing the Glass decor. I'm using FvwmPager and making a toolbar out of 
a FvwmButtons swallowing a FvwmIconMan. (FvwmTaskBar is too crashy with 
transparency, especially on Sun.) The FvwmIconBox module is being used 
to control the clutter of the Gimp's many icons. The relevant configs 
are there. Fvwm workers, you can consider that a screenshot submission :-)

A tarball of the whole thing except for screen wallpapers is available 
as before. You can get it all at 
<http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm-decors.html>

Is there a way to see if fvwm is built with gnome support? I tried
"fvwm-config -i" but I don't know if it should show in there.
It does say on gnome-libs: no, but is it the same as
--enable-gnome-hints and --with-gnome?
I am running 2.5.10 from FreeBSD ports, and fvwm/gnome
are behaving weird together (new programs start on page 1,
iconified windows show on nautilus desktop, etc.), even though
I have all ewmh* style options turned on.
Thanks,
Mikko

--enable-gnome-hints is obsolete; gnome hints are compiled in
unconditionally and may be turned off in the config if needed.

--with-gnome is related to the line you see in 'fvwm-config -i':
	gnome-libs (in FvwmGtk): yes

As you see, gnome-libs only affects FvwmGtk module and nothing else.

I think there were discussions on this list about Nautilus recently.
You may try turning hints off rather than on (that is the default).

Regards,
Mikhael.

This is working fine now...

But now I have the Mozilla-Buttons and do not know, how to bind the to
the Mozilla-Functions...=20

And yes, I have creates a nes keysym.h with "MyCompute", "Calculator",
"Home", "EMail", "Mozilla_Back", "Mozilla_Forward", "Mozilla_Stop",
"Mozilla_Search", "Mozilla_Refresh", "Mozilla_Favorites", "Power",
"Sleep" and "Wake".

Recompiled xfree86 (Debian, WOODY) and gotten what I have expected.

Should I send it to the developers of xfree86 ?

But for now, I do not know, how to bind the keys to Mozilla...

Can anyone help me please ?

Greetings
Michelle

I've seen metacity and openbox recently and noted a feature which
would be (I think) nice to have in FVWM.

When you cycle windows in those WMs black empty frame is drawn showing
geometry of obscured windows.

FvwmProxy does something remotely like that, but does not visually show
window geometry. Maybe it is possible to hack FvwmProxy instead?

I suck at unix programming, so won't be able to write a patch, but maybe
this could be added into todo list or something? :)

That is up to you, but I don't think they would want a keysum named
"Mozilla_Refresh", maybe just plain "Refresh".
There are a lot of unused keysyms in that file that
can be used.

I got a piece of code some time ago to toggle the title bar on and
off. It worked with 2.5.11 but now is not working with the snapshot
august 3. It is only removing the title, but not returning it, and I
was wondering if there is a problem with the code or if there was a
bug/change in fvwm.

The code:

DestroyFunc title-bar-toggle
AddToFunc title-bar-toggle
+ "I" ThisWindow (State 11) WindowStyle Title
+ "I" TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title
+ "I" State 11 toggle


Thanks

I'm not sure whether this information is correct.  As far as I
know, combining styles and states broke on 2nd of April (after the
2.5.10 release) and was fixed on 3rd of October (after the 2.5.11
release):

 2.5.10              : ok
 April 1 and earlier : ok
 April 2             : depends on time of snapshot
 April 3             : broken
 August 3            : broken
 2.5.11              : broken
 October 2           : broken
 October 3           : depends on time of snapshot
 October 4 and later : ok
 2.5.12              : ok

As this problem seems to bite quite a few people, I will release
2.5.12 soon.

My problem is, that I have a Multi-User/Language environement...
Using "other" keysyms let me run into trouble...

I have already tried this...
Collecting all needed keysys and then filtering against keysyms.h

OK...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2; format=flowed

Hello,

would it be possible to make fvwm remember the page positions on all 
desktops, somehow like in the attached patch? After applying it, it is 
possible to use a new command called GotoDeskPrevPage, which works like 
ordinary GotoDesk, only it jumps to the position where user previously 
left the target desk. I found it quite useful, when I switch between two 
desktops back and forth using keyboard and have two windows on different 
places on each desk.

I don't know the fvwm internals very well, so the patch can be buggy, 
but I am sending it for illustration anyway :)

Regards,

Hello,

I encountered an issue with GNU Krell Monitor (http://gkrellm.net), when 
using multiple pages per desktop. If GKrellM is started on an other page 
than the top left (or northwest), the main window disappears shortly 
after startup. It seems to be related to the XShapeCombineMask function, 
as after commenting gtk_widget_shape_combine_mask in the gkrellm 
sources, gkrellm works even when started on the other pages.

Regards,

Hey...

I'm using fvwm for about three weeks now, and I'm really impressed.
Everything seems to be possible with this WM... :-)

But there's one thing I haven't found yet: I use a Xinerama setup with two
screens. I'd like to see a gkrellm and a FvwmPager on the right border of
the left screen, but they should not get covered when I maximize a window.

I can use something like 'EwmhBaseStruts 0 68 0 0', so the windows leave
out the space, but this setting affects the right screen, too. I cannot
maximize windows on the right screen.

Another idea is to use 'Maximize -68p 100', but I think that would have
the same results (even if I didn't test it).

Is there a way to set one of these for each screen separately? Or is there
a workaround for this ("if window on screen 0 then maximize -68p 100 else
maximize 100 100")?


Ciao,
Ronald.

The following function issues "maximize -68p 100" if the pointer's
x position is < 1024 and "maximize 100 100" otherwise.

  addtofunc mymaximize
  + i piperead `if [ $[pointer.x] -lt 1024 ]; then echo maximize -68p 100; =
else echo maximize 100 100; fi`

This one uses -68p if the right edge of the window is on the left
screen:

  addtofunc mymaximize2
  + i piperead `if [ $(( $[w.x] + $[w.width] )) -le 1024 ]; then echo maxim=
ize -68p 100; else echo maximize 100 100; fi`

You get the idea.  If fvwm does not support it, you can often
pass some variable to a shell and let it do the calculations.
It's a bit confusing because the inner $[w.x] etc is expanded by
fvwm, while all remaining $... are expanded by the shell.  The man
page documents all the variable fvwm supports (section COMMAND
EXPANSION).

There seems to be a bug in FvwmIdentify in 2.5.12.

When an FvwmIdentify comes up, it is completely blank;
its contents are not visible.

But if you cover the window with another window, say and xterm,
then uncover it, then the FvwmIdentify window repaints itself and
its contents become visible.

In a previous message I wrote about what appears to be a bug
in FvwmIdentify in 2.5.12.

I am not so sure about this anymore.  On two machines which
are set up identically as far as I can tell, I get the normal
behavior on one and the buggy behavior on the other.  I will
have to investigate this further.

Hello,

I recently upgraded from 2.5.10 to 2.5.12.  My config file has been
using a copy and paste of the FAQ's autohide setup (7.17) since 2.5.8.

Prior to my move to 2.5.12, if I kept the mouse pointer on an item that
had been "unhidden", that item would remain unhidden until I moved the
mouse pointer off of that item.

Now with my move to 2.5.12, keeping the mouse pointer on the unhidden
item will not keep that item unhidden.  In this state, that item will
remain unhidden per the 'hide delay' millisecond value in the config
file.  But, if the mouse pointer is quickly moved to the root window
the unhidden item will remain unhidden until I move the mouse pointer
off of the root window.

Since I have the pager (via a FvwmButtons swallow) autohidden, this new
scenario makes moving windows around in the pager a bit difficult.  I
could increase the hide delay value, but that would kind of defeat the
purpose of autohiding.

I was surprised to not see this already covered on the mailing list. 
Perhaps autohiding your pager is not as common as I thought it would
be.

Any ideas on how to get my prior behavior back would be very much
appreciated.

Thanks,
Scott

You are right.  A bug fix in the return code handling of
conditional commands breaks the code from the FAQ.  You have to
replace

 + I ThisWindow ($0) ThisWindow (shaded) WindowShade off

with

 + I ThisWindow ($0) KeepRc ThisWindow (shaded) WindowShade off
                     ^^^^^^

to make it work again.  It's the same in the second version of the
function.  Add "KeepRc" before the nested call to ThisWindow.

Ciao

Hi, all
I am new to fvwm, sorry if I pose a old question here.

I am using fvwm 2.4.18, and when I running some application in
fullscreen mode, the taskbar becomes unavailable.

My question is, is it possible to wake up the taskbar when it's covered
by some other fullscreen applications? say something like
autohide-autoshowup, but the simple autohide option of FvwmTaskBar does
not work here because the taskbar becomes completely invisible. or some
key binding?

thanks for your advice
David

I recommend to use a key binding:

  key f1 a n All (FvwmTaskBar) Layer 0 99

puts the TaskBar above all other windows, and

  key f2 a n All (FvwmTaskBar) Layer 0 4

puts it back where is belongs (upon pressing f1/f2).

thanks Dominik
the method really works !^_^

and two more newbie questions:
1. (emerge when reading the fvwm2 manual) what does the default layer=4
means? all the application windows sharing a common default layer?
2. how can we tell if two application windows are in the same layer or
not? say we start a application window and then another.

thanks again
David

I have a sticky application, which has menu options for popping up
non-sticky dialog windows. I have the following in my .fvwmrc

+ I ThisWindow ("Shortcuts") MoveToDesk

With 2.5.10 this would mean that the pop window would always appear on
the current desk, no matter which desk I'd viewed it on before. However
with 2.5.11 it keeps popping up on the original desk. The appropriate
debug output is:

[FVWM][__explain_placement]: placed new window 0x2000186 'Shortcuts':
  desk 0 (current desk)
  current page
  position 514 62, placed by fvwm (normal placement)

Hi, all
I am using Citrix ICA client on a fvwm linux machine to access a Windows
2000 desktop environment. ICA client to Citrix MetaFrame server on
Windows is just like vncclient to vncserver.

When connection is established, the remote Windows desktop shows up on
local monitor in fullscreen mode, then I launch an application within
the desktop, then the application window show up at one place, AND
immediately move to the left-hand side of the screen, i.e, the
application window got relocated.

In my opinion, the application window is first located by the Citrix
Server/Client, then relocated by the Fvwm window manager--always to the
very left side of the screen--wired!?

The only exception is that: if I open an application window, and close
it after it has happily relocated, then open again, it will show up at
the place where it's closed without relocation.

My question is: Why this kind of relocation happens? How to avoid it?

Environment is:
Fvwm: 2.4.18
Citrix ICA Client: 7.17

thanks for your kindly help!
David

Yes, you are right.  MoveToDesk without an argument does not work
anymore.  I'll fix it in 2.5.13.  Meanwhile you can solve the
problem with

  + I ThisWindow ("Shortcuts") MoveToDesk 0 $[desk.n]

Yes, unless the fvwm config or the application requests something
else.

If you can raise one above the other and vice versa, they are in
the same layer.  Otherwise, the upper window is on a higher layer.
For more information, you can run the FvwmIdent module.  Among
other bits of information, it displays the window's layer.

(While you are on the fvwm mailing lists, please write replies
below the quoted sections of the original mail).

I'm not aware of any version of Citrix that can create individual application
windows that can be managed by the X windows window manager.  There could be
one, I just doubt it.  Especially if you have Citrix running in full screen
mode.

If you still think Fvwm is managing these windows, use FvwmIdent first on the
Citrix window, then on the application window inside the Citrix window.

Also, look at the window borders, are they Fvwm borders or windows borders.

That's impossible.  When a new window requests to be
mapped, the window manager intercepts the request and determines
if and where the window is mapped.  The ICA client can do nothing
to prevent the WM from doing that.  If the window then jumps to
another position, someone has asked the window manager to move it.
Again, neither the ICA client nor the application has any way to
*force* the window manager to do that.

That's more proof that it is not the window manager that does
funny things.  I guess either the application or the ICA client
remember the original window position and restore them when the
window is mapped the second time.

> My question is: Why this kind of relocation happens? How to avoid it?

Look for an option in the ICA client that tells it to place
windows itself and disable it.

Hi,

After "borrowing" this code from another fvwm user a long time ago it
turns out that
it's no longer working and is baffling me. Perhaps i'm missing
something obvious.

AddToFunc   ToggleWindowTitle
+ I ThisWindow (State 11) ThisWindow WindowStyle Title
+ I TestRc (!Match) ThisWindow WindowStyle NoTitle
+ I ThisWindow State 11 toggle


Yet this seems to work just fine (toggling obviously works):

AddToFunc   ToggleWindowTitle
+ I ThisWindow (State 11) Echo "Window title is turned on"
+ I TestRc (!Match) Echo "Window title is GONE"
+ I ThisWindow State 11 toggle


If i manually toggle the State it will work once more. It seems there
is a problem with
my TestRc line ... any ideas?

(Am running Fvwm 2.5.11)

Hello,

I have just upgraded to 2.5.11, and I would like to write a nice
window menu.  And I also want to be able to maximize windows to "real"
fullscreen modes.

A while back, I found a function like this in a posting:

DestroyFunc FullScreen
AddToFunc FullScreen
   + I ThisWindow (Maximized) WindowStyle Title, Borders
   + I TestRc (!Match) WindowStyle !Title, !Borders
   + I TestRc (!Match) Raise
   + I TestRc (!Match) UpdateStyles
   + I Maximize 100 100

But I have problems with the menu:

AddToMenu WindowMenu
   + DynamicPopupAction Function WindowMenuFunc
DestroyFunc WindowMenuFunc
AddToFunc WindowMenuFunc
   + I DestroyMenu recreate WindowMenu
   + I AddToMenu WindowMenu
   + I Current (Maximized) + "Unmaximize" Maximize false
   + I Current (!Maximized) + "Maximize..." Maximize -60p 100 
   + I Current (??) + "Unfullscreen" FullScreen
   + I Current (!??) + "Fullscreen" FullScreen

What I'd like to have is this:
- an unmaximized, "unfullscreened" window can be maximized and also 
  "fullscreened", and the menu should say "Maximize" and "Fullscreen";
- a maximized, unfullscreen window can be unmaximized and also
  fullscreened, and the menu should say so;
- a fullscreen window can be unfullscreened but it cannot be maximized
  or unmaximized, only returned to its former (maximized or
  unmaximized) state (I don't want to end up with unmaximized windows
  without title and borders, but will this function do this?), and the
  menu should grey out the (Un)Maximize item (is there a way to do
  that?) or it should disappear altogether.

I guessed that I have to define some State for the FullScreen function
(hence the ?? and !??), and then I could perhaps do something like
this:

   + I Current (Maximized, !??) + "Unmaximize" Maximize false
   + I Current (!Maximized) + "Maximize..." Maximize -60p 100 
   + I Current (??) + "Unfullscreen" UnFullScreen
   + I Current (!??) + "Fullscreen" FullScreen

The manpage, however, doesn't say a lot about defining and using
states, and I have not been able to find examples.  Is this the right
way to go at all?  Also, should there be separate FullScreen /
UnFullScreen functions instead of this one?  Any ideas would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg

Hi list!

I'm wondering if there's a way to make the relief around pressed 
title button to be 1 pixel wide (now it's 2 pixels).

I've made simple vector buttons and I'd like to have some
visual feedback when button is pressed.  Here is how I do this:

<my-rc-file>

DestroyDecor DefaultDecor
AddToDecor   DefaultDecor
+ TitleStyle            RightJustified -- Flat
+ AddButtonStyle 1      AllUp    Vector 5 40x40@3 40x60@3 60x60@3 60x40@3 40x40@3
+ AddButtonStyle 6      AllUp    Vector 5 30x65@3 30x70@3 70x70@3 70x65@3 30x65@3
+ AddButtonStyle 4      AllUp    Vector 5 30x30@3 30x70@3 70x70@3 70x30@3 30x30@3
+ AddButtonStyle 2      AllUp    Vector 4 35x35@3 65x65@3 65x35@4 35x65@3
+ AddButtonStyle 1      AllDown  Vector 5 40x40@3 40x60@3 60x60@3 60x40@3 40x40@3
+ AddButtonStyle 6      AllDown  Vector 5 30x65@3 30x70@3 70x70@3 70x65@3 30x65@3
+ AddButtonStyle 4      AllDown  Vector 5 30x30@3 30x70@3 70x70@3 70x30@3 30x30@3
+ AddButtonStyle 2      AllDown  Vector 4 35x35@3 65x65@3 65x35@4 35x65@3
+ ButtonStyle 1         - MwmDecorMenu
+ ButtonStyle 6         - MwmDecorMin
+ ButtonStyle 4         - MwmDecorMax
+ ButtonStyle           All -- Flat
+ ButtonStyle           All ActiveDown -- Raised
+ ButtonStyle           All InactiveDown -- Raised

</my-rc-file>

The two last lines do the job.  Everything works just fine 
except the relief (3D border) of pressed button is 2 pixels 
wide.

I've searched the man pages but did not find any solution (though 
I probably searched it badly?).

And another thing.  The title button stays in pressed state even
if mouse is not over it.  And corrresponding action happens when
one releases mouse button anywhere on the screen.  Is there a way
to (a) make title button to be in pressed state if mouse is over it
only, and (b) invoke button-related action if mouse is released
over button?

Thank you,

Yuri

The state flags get overwritten by the WindowStyle command.
Please upgrade to 2.5.12 or downgrade to 2.5.10.

Exactly.  Use this version of the FS functions:

  DestroyFunc FullScreenToggle
  AddToFunc FullScreenToggle
  + I ThisWindow (State 23) FullScreenOff
  + I TestRc (!Match) FullScreenOn

  DestroyFunc FullScreenOn
  AddToFunc FullScreenOn
  + I WindowStyle !Title, !Borders
  + I Raise
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize on 100 100
  + I State 23 on

  DestroyFunc FullScreenOff
  AddToFunc FullScreenOff
  + I WindowStyle Title, Borders
  + I Maximize off
  + I State 23 off

And

  + I Current (Maximized, !State 23) + "Unmaximize" Maximize false
  + I Current (!Maximized) + "Maximize..." Maximize -60p 100=20
  + I Current (State 23) + "Unfullscreen" UnFullScreen
  + I Current (!State 23) + "Fullscreen" FullScreen

But you need to upgrade to 2.5.12 to make it work.  There is a bug
in 2.5.11 (it erases the state when WindowStyle is called).

I think so.  TestRc should mainly be used with the break command,
not to code different types of behaviour into one functions.  It's
too easy to get it all wrong.

Hello,

I have a small script which receives one argument, builds menus
and echos fvwm commands to create them. I added the following line
to .fvwm file in order to be able to use menus created by that script:

PipeRead 'menu-builder ~/.fvwm/menu'

but when I try to pop up one of the created menus (executing "popup XYZ"
from FvwmConsole), I get an error:

"Menu XYZ does not exists".

If I ran the script manually and copy/paste it's output into
FvwmConsole and then try to pop up menus, it works.

What can I do so that the script will work automatically
(I want to use that script rather than the standard ones for
menu creation)?

I use fvwm 2.5.12.

Daniel.

I had this problem also. There is a bug in 2.5.11 which has been fixed
about 3 days after 2.5.11 went out. Its in current cvs and will be in
2.5.12. Either upgrade to cvs or wait for next version and it will be
solved.

Hi,

I'm used fvwm 2.5.11, I first tiled and then cascaded my windows, and
ever since I've been unable to resize windows by dragging them from
the corners. I'm quite sure I didn't modify my rc-file.

I tried fvwm 2.5.12 and 2.4.18. No luck. Now I'm running 2.5.12 since
it doesn't seem the problem is very version dependant.

Help would be appreciated.

It's hard to say what goes wrong without knowing the script.  Can
you please post it to the list?

Sounds like FAQ question 0.1.  Do you have num-lock pressed or
another locking modifier key?

No, no modifier keys pressed. I've got even IgnoreModifiers L2

The script is included below. It is only a first draft version,
and using anything complex will probably break it.

Usage:

The script receives one argument, which should be a path to
a directory where menu configuration files reside.

The script (recursively) does the following:

Every directory becomes a menu, with the same label as a
directory. for example, ~/.fvwm/menu will become a manu with
'menu' as a label (the menu itself will be named ~/.fvwm/menu).
Subirectories in a given directory will become submenus, and
files in a directory will contain configuration for menu items.
For example, '+ "Firefox browser" Exec exec mozilla-firefox'
expression, which can be part of a AddToMenu command, will appear
in some file in a directory without the leading '+'. Such an
expressions may be put into one or more files in a directory (in
case of multiple files, their contents will be simply concatanated
- files would be read in alphabetical order of their names).

Single letter on a line tells how to sort items/submenus in a
menu. Default is an alphabetical descending order of labels,
submenus first (which is the only working option right now). Actually,
sort order may be set for every section of a menu. Secion is all
the items from the beginning of a menu/separator till separator/end
of a menu. By default, all submenus are put into the first section.
If user wants to put it in other section, he has to insert double-quoted
name (label, actually) of that submenu into the desired section.

One of the rules, is that every line should contain a command,
in addition to menu item's label. For example, it won't work to put
'""' all alone on a line to create a separator - it should be '"" Nop',
otherwise the line would be disregarded.


And here is a script:

---------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;

my $dir = $ARGV[0];
my $menus_config;

process_dir($dir);
print $menus_config;


sub process_dir {
	my ($dir, @dir_contents, @menu_contents, %submenus_list) = shift;

	opendir(DIR, $dir) or warn "Counldn't read directory $dir: $!. Skipping...\n"
			      and return;
         @dir_contents = sort(readdir(DIR));

	foreach (@dir_contents) {
		next if (/^(\.|\.\.)$/);
		$submenus_list{$_} = 1 and next if (-d "$dir/$_");
		if (-f "$dir/$_") {
			open(FILE, "$dir/$_") or next;
			push @menu_contents, <FILE>;
			close(FILE);
		}
	}



	make_menu($dir, \%submenus_list, \@menu_contents);

	foreach (keys %submenus_list) {
		process_dir("$dir/$_");
	}
}
	

sub make_menu {
	my ($dir, $submenus_list_ref, $menu_contents_ref) = @_;

	my ($section, @sections) = [];
	foreach (@$menu_contents_ref) {
		s/^\s*//;
		s/\s*$//;
		next if ($_ eq "");
		
		push(@$section, ("CONTROL", lc($_))) and next if (length == 1);

		/^([^"].*?)\s{1,}(.*)/ or /^"(.*?)"\s*(.*)/;
		# separator or tear up menu
		if ($1 eq "") {
			push(@$section, ("", $2));
			push(@sections, $section);
			$section = [];
			next;
		}
		
		# means that it submenu is supposed to be inserted here	
		if ($2 eq "" and exists $$submenus_list_ref{$1}) {
			delete $$submenus_list_ref{$1};
		} elsif ($2 eq "") {
			next;
		}
		
		push(@$section, ($1, $2));
	}
	push(@sections, $section);

	# if some of the submenu names were not in one of the sections,
	# insert them all into the first section, and sort according to
	# that section's rules.
	foreach (keys %$submenus_list_ref) {
		push(@{$sections[0]}, ($_, ""));
	}
		
	$menus_config .= "AddToMenu \"$dir\"\n";
	foreach (@sections) {
		sort_section($dir, $_);
		foreach (@$_) {
			$menus_config .= $_;
		}
	}

}	
			
sub sort_section {
	my $dir = shift;
	my $section_ref = shift;
	my %entries = @$section_ref;

	my $sort_type = $entries{CONTROL};
	delete $entries{CONTROL};
	
	my (@submenus, @items, @processed_section);
	# Alphabetic sort, submenus at the beginning
	if ($sort_type eq "") {
		foreach (sort keys %entries) {
			push(@submenus, "+ \"$_\" PopUp \"$dir/$_\"\n") and next
				if ($entries{$_} eq "");
				
			push(@items, "+ \"$_\" $entries{$_}\n");
		}
		
		@processed_section = (@submenus, @items);
		
	} elsif ($sort_type eq "n") { # no sorting
	
		for (my $n = 0; $n < $#$section_ref; $n += 2) {
			push(@processed_section, "+ \"$section_ref->[$n]\" PopUp ",
			     "\"$dir/$section_ref->[$n]\"\n") and next
			     if ( $section_ref->[$n+1] eq "");
				
			push(@processed_section, "+ \"$section_ref->[$n]\" ",
			     "$section_ref->[$n+1]\n");
		}
	}
	
	@$section_ref = @processed_section;
}
---------------------------------------------------

I have a great doubt, though, that somebody is going to
get to that last line :).

Hm, are you aware that such a script is included in the fvwm
tarball?  Look for fvwm-menu-directory.  It even has a man page.
If you instist on writing your own script, take utmost care that
file and directory names with embedded spaces, tabs and newlines
are handled correctly.  Otherwise you might end up running
commands embedded in a file name, e.g. if the name is

 "foo<newline>rm -rf *"

Your script seems to work fine for me.  Are you sure it it
executed at all?  Is it in the PATH?  Hm, nor that I run it again,
it sometimes hangs or dumps the contents of the files in the
given directory.

Please strip down your config files as much as possible so that
the problem still occurs, then post it to the mailing list (along
with step-by-step instructions to make it happen).

Hi!

I just installed FVWM on Cygwin/Windows2000 and am running into a
series of problems that may be related.

First, the shell (bash) prompt on xterms is gobbledygook and many keys
fail to work properly.  Most annoyingly, the up arrow key on xterms
fails to produce earlier commands in the shell's history.  In fact,
the shell's readline features are all gone in these xterms.  I should
stress that all keys and bash readline features work perfectly on
non-X Cygwin terminals; they fall apart only when going through FVWM.

What can I do to fix these problems?  Is there a standard config file
for FVWM under Cygwin?

Thanks!

Kynn

If I understood the man page correctly, it doesn't do what I want
- it creates a kind of a directory browser, but I want to create
a regular menu. The other solution can be to create Gnome/Kde
menu and then run a script included with fwvm to convert that menu
to fvwm's format.

Yes, it is in the path. Don't know about whether it is actually
executed when fvwm starts, but manually it always executes correctly.

I'm guessing you are logging in to a remote system.
If so, make sure your profile on the remote system is not running
xmodmap.

I don't think this is an Fvwm problem.

I think it would be better to warn people not to run the included script
on random directories, since it just slightly preprocesses the content of
all files and dirs and dumps it (binary or not).

If I understand you correctly, you want to create an alternative syntax
for menus and use a specially prepared dir structure and file contents
for this purpose.

I think there is an error in the script somewhere that gives you the
problem. I suggest to add "DestroyMenu" commands before "AddToMenu", so
you could PipeRead the script more than once.

I guess the actual error message is "No such menu XYZ". Maybe you run the
script manually with different parameters and then get menu XYZ defined?
I suggest to examine again the config line you use to run the script and
its output.

If you still think there is a problem in fvwm, then:

  * pack the whole dir used to define the menus to tar.gz and send it
  * prepare a minimal .fvwm2rc config file with 2-3 lines that shows the
    "No such menu XYZ" problem and send it
  * send the new script version that does "DestroyMenu" first
  * send the output of the same script command you have in the minimal
    config file (with menu XYZ defined, just to compare the results)

It is possible you will find the problem before completing these steps.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
    I am using 2.5.10. How can I set TitleAt/Bottom/Left/Right for
a particular window ? When I use "Style $n TitleAtBottom" on a window
it changes for all same class windows. For Eg. When I run this on one
xterm , this will change the Title position for all the xterm. I
would like to change the title position for only one xterm.
How can I do this?

Below are the part from from my .fvmrc. when I am trying to change
the Title position depending upon the direction of window shade.
This changes the Titlebar position, But it also does this on other
windows.

I use FvwmButtons as a panel, taking up the top 60 pixels of my screen,
so I have the following:

EwmhBaseStruts 0 0 60 0
Style "*"           MinOverlapPlacement

I'm trying to startup firefox with a geometry that will take up the rest
of the screen. The geometry is saved in firefox's configuration files.
I hoped that it would position itself at 0,60. Instead it positions
itself at 0,0.

Is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding how this is supposed to work?
If it is the latter, how do I tell fvwm that I want no applications
placed in the area occupied by the panel?

The debug output is:

 [FVWM][__explain_placement]: placed new window 0x2200042 'Mozilla
Firefox':  desk 4 (specified by style)
  current page
  position 0 0, placed by fvwm (normal placement)
    placement method: MinOverlap

Chris

Hello,
I have to setup a linux-box in a kiosk-mode. Therefore I wanted to use 
fvwm even though I'm not familiar to it.
I want to have a titel for every window and just one button in the top 
left corner. The button should be a typicall "x" for our windows-user.  
Resizing should not be possible and perhaps moving too.
At the moment my .fvwm2rc looks like this:
---------------my .fvwm2rc--------------------------
Emulate win
Style "*" ClickToFocus
Style "*" MWMFunctions
Style "*" HintOverride
Style "*" MWMDecor
OpaqueMoveSize 100
EdgeScroll 100 100
EdgeResistance 250 10
Style "*" RandomPlacement
Style "*" NoPPosition
DeskTopSize 1x1

# Should be an "x"-Button - but isn't. Told at
# http://www.linux-magazin.de/Artikel/ausgabe/1996/09/Fvwm/fvwm-abb1.gif
ButtonStyle 1   4       26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1
                        79x29@1 63x48@1 79x65@1 70x75@0
                        50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0

# Close Window by pushing button on top-right
Mouse   1       1       A       Close
# No mouse-actions allowed:
Mouse   0       R       A       nop
Mouse   0       W       A       nop

Mouse   0       S       A       nop
Mouse   0       F       A       nop
Mouse   0       I       A       nop
---------------------------------------------------------
How can I get the button from top-left to top-right? And why doesn't it 
look like an "X". 

Thank you very much!

Best regards
  Volker

The top right would be button 2, not 1.

The second number is the number of points in the vector.
You want 13, not 4.

You need backslashes at the end of each line:

ButtonStyle 2 13        26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1 \
                        79x29@1 63x48@1 79x65@1 70x75@0 \
                        50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0

thank you very much! The Button looks right and is at the right place 
now! 
There is still another problem: Not every window get's the frame with 
titel and button. I'm using a java-programm - 
http://www.nmichael.de/software/efa.html
I've testest it using KDE and Windows. When using them ervery window has 
it's own frame. 
Now using fvwm on another machine you get for example a login-window, 
but you don't have any chance to cancle without a close-button. 
Some windows are great - others miss a frame. 

How can I solve that?

Thanks.& best regards
   Volker

ok, now I know, that I have problems with transient windows. I put this 
in my config-file:
Style "*" DecorateTransient
and removed this:
Style "*" MWMFunctions

Now I have a titel-bar at my transient window, but I'm still missing the 
close-Butten. How can I reach this? 

Thanks & best regards

I'm sorry. I've read this question in the faq bevore, but I still don't 
get it. 
Now I have thoe follwing settings:
Style "*" ClickToFocus
Style "*" MWMButtons
Style "*" HintOverride
Style "*" MWMDecor
Style "*" DecorateTransient
Style "*" SmartPlacement
OpaqueMoveSize 100
EdgeScroll 100 100
EdgeResistance 250 10
DeskTopSize 1x1
ButtonStyle 2 - Clear MWMDecorMin
Mouse   1       2       A       Close
Mouse   0       R       A       nop
Mouse   0       W       A       nop
Mouse   0       T       A       nop
Mouse   0       S       A       nop
Mouse   0       F       A       nop
Mouse   0       I       A       nop

I have nothing to add to FAQ. FAQ explains that the first line above
informs fvwm that your button 2 is a minimize (iconify) button. As such
this button is hidden when applications ask to disable iconify function.

Please do what the FAQ 3.22 says to fix your windows-like button layout:

  ButtonStyle 2 - Clear

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thank you, it works -- and it works in 2.5.11 for me; I do not 
experience the bug.

Is there any way to make FVWM completely "forget" a titlebar button once 
it's there?  For instance, I define these functions:

AddToFunc ButtonFunctions
+ I Mouse 1         $[MaxButton]   A   Maximize 0 100
+ I Mouse 2         $[MaxButton]   A   Maximize 100 0
+ I Mouse 3         $[MaxButton]   A   Maximize
+ I Mouse 1         $[KillButton]  A   Delete
+ I Mouse 1         $[MinButton]   A   Iconify

AddToFunc TwmButtonOrder
# Buttons 2-4 in TWM "native" order
+ I SetEnv MenuButton 1
+ I SetEnv MaxButton  2
+ I SetEnv KillButton 3
+ I SetEnv MinButton  4
+ I Function ButtonFunctions

AddToFunc WindozeButtonOrder
# These do the buttons in windoze order
+ I SetEnv MenuButton 1
+ I SetEnv KillButton 2
+ I SetEnv MaxButton  4
+ I SetEnv MinButton  6
+ I Function ButtonFunctions

Then I re-load the ButtonStyles like so:
AddButtonStyle $[MenuButton] Inactive pixmap buttons/AquaGray.xpm


If I start with TwmButtonOrder and then do "Function WindozeButtonOrder, 
I can't figure out how to make Button 3 disappear.  I can undefine its 
function or give it an invisible icon, but it's still in the titlebar, 
as can be seen if the buttons are raised or sunken.

Look at using FvwmEvent to change TitleButtons on the fly. As to what the
event is, is left up to how you want the window to react. :)

I dont suppose theres a way of fvwm reaching into a window's environment
variables, is there?

I want to make windows started from a different "environment" look different.

Running 2.5.12

I s'pose i can have FvwmEvent add_event read some /tmp/fvwm_env file
written at the time the app is started. But is there a better way?

Well, actually, this wouldnt even work, as an app can open another window
some time later, and then add_event and /tmp/fvwm_env file would have
nothing to do w/ each other.

Hello,

I've been encountering a couple of strange problems with FVWM 2.4.18 on
my SGI Octane (running Irix 6.5.x). What happens, basically, is that
under certain (but not all, see below) circumstances, dialog boxes seem
to consistently stay under any other windows, and cannot be raised by
any means. Also, for some cases, the dialog box will be popped up on the
wrong desktop (Desktop 0), though usually on the correct page of the
desktop. These problems happen quite consistently.

Here's one way I can consistently reproduce the first issue:
1. Start up Netscape (I have version 4.76, if that matters).
2. Open the "Find in page" dialog box
   - At this point, it will pop up correctly
3. Close the dialog box
4. Open the "Find in page" dialog box again
   - At this point, the dialog box is typically partialy obscured by the
main window (which is already wrong, as it should be ABOVE the window),
and no matter what I do, it cannot be raised!

A couple of things I noticed: 
- this ONLY happens after a dialog box has been closed once.
- this same problem occurs with Netscape even if I run it remotely from
other machines and other OS's, with DISPLAY set to mine. E.g., I tried
running netscape remotely from another SGI box, and then a SUN box, with
the same results; however, running Moxilla Firefox from the same SUN did
not exibit the problem.
- the above problem is also seen with other programs, some examples
being NEdit, xv, Rational Purify, Framemaker, and Adobe Acrobat.

The second problem (or perhaps it's an additional symptom of the same
problem) occurs less often, but is just as bizzare: following the same
procedure as above not only causes the dialog box to pop up in a lowered
state that cannot be changed, but it also pops up on the wrong desktop
(always on Desktop 0), and FVWM will switch to that desktop.  The page
of the desktop will be "correct"--e.g., if the program in question is
running on the lower-right page of desktop 3, the dialog box will pop up
on the lower-right page of desktop 1, and desktop 1 will be displayed.

At this point, I've no clue where to look for the problem.  I don't
think I have anything unusual in the fvwm config files, and fvwm does
not report any errors. I believe I've had this problem with an earlier
version of fvwm as well (I compile my own, btw, so this is not any pre-
made distribution).

Any suggestions would be very helpful. Let me know if additional
information is needed. Also, please CC: my address (vg23 [at] cornell
[dot] edu), as I am not currently a subscriber to the list.

Thanks for any advice!

If your xterm sets WINDOWID (mine does) and if you run FvwmCommandS,
then in your shell's initialization files (or from anywhere else) run:

  FvwmCommand "WindowId $WINDOWID WindowStyle HandleWidth 20"

You get the idea.

Thanx for the suggestion.
However, how do i do that for other apps, or windows spawned after startup?
For my cmdtool, i play w/ the title to trigger FvwmEvent, but i dont
always have title freedom for other apps.

Hello all,

I've found a problem with selecting windows which name/res/class/icon
contains a literal *.
I've looked in the source code, and if I understand it function
matchWildcards from libs/wild.c use every * as a wildcard, so there is no
chance to match only a literal *.
I think I can patch it to use ** as a literal *, but I'm not sure if
it's a good way of resolving this problem.

PS. Just a reminder: Some time ago I've send a patch to fvwm-workers 
adding new test condition named Compare for comparing two values (this
helps saving process creation just for a simple comarision).
Is there any chance that this will be joined into fvwm? ;-)

PS.2. Sorry for my english... ;-)

** is used to match all windows in the Icon style.
(here "Style * Icon ..." only sets the default icon if the program doesn't 
specify one, "Style ** Icon .." also overrides program-specified icons for 
all windows)

Hello list,

I have 

EdgeCommand Right Module FvwmPager -transient

in my .fvwm2rc.  But I would like the pager to disappear (be deleted)  
not only on any key release and mouse click, but also simply when the
pointer leaves the pager window.  So I started playing around with the
example in FAQ 7.17.  What I found is that it does not work at all
with the -transient option; and if I don't have that option, the pager
does not get placed under the pointer at all, but as any other window, 
typically on the other side of the screen.

Is there a way I can teach Fvwm to close a transient pager as soon as 
the pointer leaves its window?  Perhaps the best would be if the pager 
would come up if the pointer hits the screen edge, the pointer is 
warped to the middle of the pager, but it is closed on any keyrelease 
or if the pointer is moved out of the window.

Cheers,
Greg

I know that with Style you can use ** as a literal *, but the problem
which I've written about with conditional commands (All,Any,...). I've
tested it and looked up in the source code, and if I understand what
i've seen ;-) there is no way to match a window with literal * in it's
name.

I've had similar config. My pager is raised when mouse hit the edge, and
lowered back when mouse leave it's window.
Here is a sample:

EdgeCommand Top FocusPager

Module FvwmAuto 100 \
	"Silent PagerUpFunction" \
	"Silent PagerDownFunction"

DestroyFunc PagerUpFunction
AddToFunc PagerUpFunction
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Layer 0 0
+ I Current (Layer 0, FvwmPager) Layer 0 6
+ I Current (FvwmPager) Raise

DestroyFunc PagerDownFunction
AddToFunc PagerDownFunction
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Layer 0 0

DestroyFunc FocusPager
AddToFunc FocusPager
+ I All (FvwmPager) Focus
+ I Current (FvwmPager) Layer 0 6
+ I Current (FvwmPager) Raise

Style FvwmPager Sticky, Layer 0, FixedPosition, FPLenient, \
        !FPEnterToFocus, FPLeaveToUnfocus, FPClickToFocus, \
	FPFocusByFunction, !FPGrabFocus, FPReleaseFocus, \
	FPReleaseFocusTransient, NoTitle, NoIcon, FixedSize

You'll have to adapt it to your config, but it should be easy. ;-)

Hi,

I'm trying to get Japanese text to display
on the title bars and menus in fvwm.

I tried all these (Individually, I mean) in my .fvwm2rc file:
Style * Font "xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"
Style * Font "xft:Bitstream Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646-1"
Style * Font "xft:Luxi Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso8859-1"

I also tried with EUC-JP as encoding:
Style * Font "xft:Kochi Mincho"
Style * Font "xft:Kochi Mincho:encoding=EUC-JP"

And various such combinations. But the text does
not appear; instead I see only dots (2 for every
japanese character), or I see nothing at all.

I also tried running fvwm with the LANG variable
set to "ja_JP", "ja_JP.eucJP", and so on. The only
change when I do this is that the fonts look
'different', but the actual Japanese text still
doesn't display - either I see dots or some
garbage in their place.

I think I'm missing something basic here...?
Does anyone have pointers to how this is usually
done?

My fvwm version is 2.5.12:

fvwm 2.5.12 compiled on Oct  6 2004 at 14:48:09
with support for: ReadLine, RPlay, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Bidi 
text, Xinerama, XRender, XFT, NLS

(I see Bidi text, XFT... is there anything else
needed?) This is the version from Debian
Unstable, if anyone's using it... My XFree86
version is 4.3.0.1.

Thanks,
Faiz

Hi all,

I don't know if this is an FVWM problem, or somewhere else.  But since it only 
seems to impact the GUI, I thought I'd try here first.

My system: AMD64FX51, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB HD, NVIDIA video card, Mandrake 9.2 
(official) for AMD64, fvwm 2.5.9.  fvwm 2.5.9 was re-compiled for 64 bit.

The symptom:  Everything seems to be humming along fine, when suddenly my 
interaction with Mozilla stops working.  At this point, the only thing that 
responds is the mouse and the "Num Lock" key (causes the LED to toggle).  The 
Caps Lock key does not cause the LED to toggle.  I am unable to activate any 
window or pulldown menu.  I am unable to affect any window in any way.  There 
is no window selected as the active window, and I am unable to select any 
window as the active window (I use "FocusFollowsMouse").

I am able to telnet into this machine.  A "top" indicates 98.9% idle, and only 
"X" is using the CPU.  I am able to kill off applications (Mozilla, kmail), 
but there is no change in the "X" display.  No errors or messages are present 
in /var/log/messages that are out of the normal.

On my one attempt to issue a "reboot" command from the telnet session, the 
command did not complete.  I issued a second command, which caused the PC to 
reset immediately (i.e. unclean shutdown).

This has just started happening in the last few weeks, but I don't think 
anything I messed with caused this (could be wrong though).  The fourth 
occurrence was today.  I mucked around with a bunch of DVD player stuff two 
weeks ago, but I don't -think- I overwrote anything that would cause this.  
If I did, I would expect to seem something in /var/log/messages.

Any suggestions or pointers anyone?  Or advice on what to dig for next time it 
happens?

Thanks in advance.

When there is a lock up,  do/did you have any Mozilla windows
hidden/iconified that you try to bring up?

Parv,

No.  I only had a single Mozilla window open (I use tabbed browsing).  No 
Mozilla windows were iconified, although this last lockup, kmail and an xterm 
was iconified.  I don't recall on the others.

Yes, but the problem is that neither this nor FAQ 7.17 work with a 
transient pager.  I guess I am trying to do something FvwmPager was 
not designed for: use it a bit like a windowlist or FvwmProxy to popup 
when you want to switch pages and then get out of the way.

Cheers,
Greg

Hi,

I installed fvwm 2.4.19 on a mandrake 10, but i dont have an option
under the window manager box in KDM (the login manager). Do i need to
edit a file or something to get fvwm as an option for my window manager
?

Yes, you do.  Unfortunately, it always seems to be a bit of a mess, with three 
or four different login windows installed, but only one used.  Trying to find 
the right combination of files to changes is a bit of a mess.  Here's the 
procedure I -think- I ended up going through for Mandrake 9.2.  My notes are 
about 90% complete.  First, I added a file in "/etc/X11/wmsession.d/" called 
"02Fvwm":

NAME=Fvwm
ICON=kde-wmsession.xpm
DESC=FVWM
EXEC /usr/local/bin/fvwm
SCRIPT:
exec /usr/local/bin/fvwm

Then I edited "/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc", and added "Fvwm" to the 
"SessionType" line.

You should be able to re-start X and have Fvwm show up as a possible desktop.

Look out for old "dm"s (e.g gdm) that sometimes hang around - I've had four or 
five going at once back in RH 8.0.  They wouldn't die on their own.

Good luck!

I tried to hack something into the pager code, but it does not
work reliably.  I could make it work if balloons are disabled and
the pager does not use the WindowListSkip style (i.e. the Pager
displays its own window), but I don't think that's worth the
effort.

We recently had a discussion about qouting of window titles.
Mikhael came up with with a suggestion to solve it by enhancing
$[...] expansion.  Maybe someone can look up the thread in the
list archives.

Note that I don't have access to a 64 bit machine.  Therefore it
is very difficult for me to identify and fix bugs that occur on
such machines.  Some 64 bit bugs are fixed in 2.5.12, but there is
at least one report that there are still problems.  In general,
such problems affect the communication between fvwm, its modules
and the X server.

First of all you should upgrade to 2.5.12 and check if the problem
persists.  If it does, read on.

This looks as if some application took control of the pointer or
the whole X server (in the latter case, no application would be
able to produce any output).  Try killing all applications from
the console ("pstree" for a list).  If the problem still does not
go away, it must be either fvwm or the X server.

I can not think of any way how the X server or fvwm could prevent
a reboot.  That sounds like a much more severe problem.

Another cause might be the graphics driver.  Do you use the
drivers written by NVIDIA?  They are known to cause lock-ups and
crashes.  Try the latest drivers or the drivers built into the X
server.  On the other hand, if it's the video card, the pointer
should not be moving.

I've found a thread "CVS scott: Apply conditionals patch." from July in
which this (and couple of other, even more serious) problem has been discussed,
but this thread ended with Mikhael's suggestion:
<cite>
I think the current syntax of non-option names should not be the main
one in the long run. How about to solve the whole issue correctly by
introducing the following options in conditions:
Name "pattern", IconName "pattern", Class "pattern", Resource "pattern",
AnyName "pattern"
All of these will support special pattern characters including "|".
The non-option names are still supported, but there is a better
syntax.
And we still need the variable filters like $[var:pattern], and
quoting syntax for names in conditions; "||", "**" and "??" is ok by me.
</cite>

I can implement "||", "**" and "??" part (it should be simple), but I
want to know if there is a chance to inclusion of this patch into to
fvwm (this is my original question as you can see above)?
It'll be good to implement also the proposed syntax for selecting window
exclusivly by it's class, resource, icon name or title, but I'm not
sure if I have enough skill to do it.
And there's still a problem with backward compatibility of this new
syntax. Can we just leave existing syntax as is, and add only the new
options? I know it can break backward compatibility in some (I think
rare) cases when one want to select window named for ex: "Name" or
"Resource", but in this cases there will always be posibility to use the
new option AnyName.

PS. I know I'm a little boring with this, but some time ago I've send a
patch adding new Test option... ;-)

I think someone else wanted to implement the OR syntax, i.e. "|", I have
no idea what is the status of this.

The first step (that you can do) is to handle the specified doubled chars
as escaped char rather than meta-chars in conditions. And implement one
filter "pattern" that quotes variables in order to be used in commands
that require patterns. I.e. Next ($[w.name:pattern], !Iconified) ...

If you are at it, you may implement other suggested filters, but please
test this thoroufully if you do it.

I don't think that Name/IconName/Class/Resource/AnyName should be
done before 2.6.

I guess, noone had a time to look at it yet. fvwm-workers should be a
better place for these discussions.

I tried a number of things, and could get it sort of working, but it
does not work reliably, so I gave up on the idea and continue using a
good ol' plain transient pager.  But thanks for your ideas.

Hi.

I've got xft 2.1.2.2 here, and the configure stuff uncorrectly guesses
this as < 2.0.0 ; something in the spirit of the patch attached should do
the lexicographical comparison much better, IMHO.

I've tested the helper function on some crazy shells (sunos 5.7 & osf
5.0), it seems to work as expected. It's definitely not bash-specific.

Best regards,

E.

Hi list!

As I discovered FVWM counts bytes instead of characters when 
truncating long title names in WindowList.

My locale is UTF-8 and Cyrillic characters are two bytes long, 
so long Russian titles in WindowList are screwed up.

Fvwm 2.5.12.

Best regards,

Yuri

Under fluxbox I have the command "fbrun".

Thx a lot
Tim

Hi,

sometimes i play too hard with fvwm and X,
and fvwm freeze/crash. (wont open root menu,
wont respond to fvwmcommand 'restart')

i then have to kill it, and start it again.
(fvwm is not the last thing on my .xsession)
until there, no problem.


when i start fvwm this way, the new
reference point 0,0 for my pager is the 
current page (which might be 4,5).

so i can't see the windows which are on pages lower than 4,5.


i made a small script to get back all my windows, but it's all clobbered in one page :
(i use piperead "myscript.pl" for that)


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $xwininfo=`xwininfo -root -tree`;


my @xwininfo=split /\n/,$xwininfo;

my @appwinid;
map { if (/\s+(0x\S+)\s\"/){ push @appwinid,$1}} @xwininfo;

foreach (@appwinid){
    print "echo get back: $_\n";
    print "WindowId $_ Iconify off\n";
    print "WindowId $_ movetopage 1 2\n";
}


any ideas  for moving the pager to -1 -1 or something else ?

thanks

 You can install some third-party applications -- grun, gmrun or something
else (gmrun is nice because of tab-completion ;>)

You could write one with FvwmScript or FvwmForm, you could probably just
edit the FvwmForm-Talk demo, should be very simple.

Although, there's no reason why you can't use fbrun under fvwm, I just
tried it and it works fine. I usually use gmrun, http://sf.net/projects/gmrun/

No need to edit FvwmForm-Talk, anything you type in with
a leading "!" is executed.  Also you could do:

Exec command args

I'd like to know how to suppress application-provided icons
replacing them with my own (simply Style "mywindow" Icon myicon.png
doesn't seem to work), as I don't seem to be able to grep it out of
the documentation.

I'm using the latest experimental release.

Thanks in advance! (So that you're compelled to help me out :-PP)

It is in the long list of all Style options:

  Style "mywindow" Icon myicon.png, IconOverride

Specify IconOverride for every window name you need, "*" does not work.

Hello !

I have written this snippet  of code to  change randomly my  wallpaper
every 15 minutes :

,----
| DestroyFunc RandomWallPaper
| AddToFunc RandomWallPaper
| + I Exec cd $[FVWM_WALLPAPERS] ; python -c "import glob, random, os ; os.system('Esetroot -scale %s' % random.choice(glob.glob('*.jpg')))"
| 
| DestroyFunc RescheduleRandomWallPaper
| AddToFunc RescheduleRandomWallPaper
| + I RandomWallPaper
| + I Deschedule 35
| + I Schedule 900000 35 RescheduleRandomWallPaper
`----

I call RescheduleRandomWallPaper  at start. However, after some  time,
RescheduleRandomWallPaper is not scheduled any more. Any idea why ?

Schedule is not reliable, if the server is grabbed it doesn't fire :(

All,

I think I may have found the problem, although I can't confirm it.  When 
poking around inside my PC case to install a drive, I noticed that the power 
cable to the motherboard wasn't plugged in completely.  I slight jostle would 
(and did) disconnect it.  I fixed this a week ago, and the lockup hasn't 
happened since.

I'll try Dominik's suggestions if the lockup occurs again.

Thanks.
