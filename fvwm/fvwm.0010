    I just installed fvwm-2.3.21, primarily to make use of the
ResizeHintOverride functionality.  Now I'm trying (in part) to move a
window to 0x0 and having trouble.  When running mutt, the following
works:

AddToFunc Foobar
 + I Exec rxvt -e mutt
 + I Wait "mut*"
 + I Next ("mut*") Move 0 0

When Foobar is run, mutt pops up in a window and then moves to the top
left.  However, when I try the same with my Windows 2000 TS client
(which is what I'm trying to get setup here):

AddToFunc Windows2000 
 + I Exec wfica -desc "W2000 Desktop (2)" -nosplash -quiet
 + I Wait "W2000*"
 + I Next ("W2000*") Move 0 0

The resulting window never moves to 0x0.  Note that the style on the
window is set by:

Style "W2000 Desktop*"  NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, ResizeHintOverride

if that makes a difference.

    Any ideas what could be causing the difference in behavior here?
Your help is appreciated.

( CC's appreciated )

In most cases when styles seem not to work there is a problem
with the style name.  Please use FvwmIdent to find out the
window's class and resource name.  You can use one of these as
the style name.

    Thanks for your help, but that doesn't seem to quite fix the
problem.  The Style is actually working.  I only mentioned it in case it
had an impact.  It's the Windows2000 function that's causing problems.
The Exec line works, and the Wait line waits as expected (tested by
putting debug lines before and after).   However, the Next line fails to
move the window, though it does in the function Foobar.  I can't
understand the difference.

    I did run FvwmIdent.  The Name and Icon Name are both "W2000
Desktop (2)".  The Class and Resource are both "Wfica".  I went ahead
and tried using Next ("Wfica"), but that didn't seem to work, either.

    Any more suggestions?

Thanks,
Bob

Hello,
I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'll start here.

I'm using fvwm for a thin client device and have setup the desktop (as
requested)
to mimic the windows environment (using  fvwm  2.2.4 ).  Even after
weeks of
hacking, some things just don't act like I'd expect .

So, a couple of fun questions:

1. When the "start" button is depressed, it always looks "depressed"
- any way to pop the start button back up ??
- any way to make the menu popup "on top" of the "start" button ?
(instead of off to the side - any magical context rectangle number?)

2. I start an application in another desktop, but when the application
closes, it never returns to the first desktop.  If I don't display the
Pager, there
seems "to the user" no way to get back (at least key bindings work).
- any way to automagically return to the first desktop?
- or - any way to make the taskbar popup  when a window closes??

3. What is required to get the "Beep" to work - maybe I'm missing  a
driver
file or something here. (I really want beep to work from within a
FvwmScript file!)

4. Is there any way to configure the window list so that my Alt-Tab
switches
through the  windows ? (The flipfocus doesn't seem to work as explained
in the manual)
Is there  a way to get the window list to popup in the middle of the
screen everytime ?? (more magical context rectangle numbers :)

And in the FvwmScripts:

5. Does anyone know how to make the mini-scroll bars behave ??
- one mouse click and release increments the number by two...
- first click always increments - even if you click the down button
- Maybe my mouse bindings are messing stuff up ??

6. Are the script limitations (60 variables) being lifted in the near
future ??

7. Why can you not hide rectangle widgets ?

8. Must the mouse be pointing inside the text box to accept input
? (This is annoying!)

9. Highilighting text inside an input text box has no affect  -  I
expect the highlighted text
to be erased when I press a key. Any way to configure this to work ??

Anyhow, if someone has any pointers on these questions - or if you'd
like to check out
my startup resouce file just let me know.

BTW, I have written about 3K lines of FvwmScript programs to do lots of
desktop setups
stuff.  I  copied from other scripts around and added some of my own to
do Network setup,
 Date (and time), TouchScreen calibration and Startup applications among
others. If
anyone is interested in these, just let me know...

Thanks in Advance!

Subject: FVWM: Specifying geometry with Style
To: fvwm@fvwm.org
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Can I specify geometry with the Style command,
so that, for example

    Style "*rocmeter*"    Geometry 120x80+40+20

would make it so if I run procmeter3 from the
command line, it will come up though I had said

    procmeter3 -geometry 120x80+40+20

If not via the Style command, is there another
way I can tell the window manager to make sure
when a new window comes up which satisfies some
criteria it will be resized and repositioned to
a particular geometry?

You should narrow the problem first.

One of 3 things happen:
  1) Wait is not passed. To test this, add after Wait this line: + I Beep
  2) Next returns nothing. To test this, write: + I Next ("W2000*") Beep
  3) Move is not working on this window for some reason

You can use other than Beep test command, like: Exec xmessage "Passed 1".

If [1] - the problem may be in resource names at the window creation time.
As a side note, the Wait syntax you use (quotes) is only valid after 2.3.16.
If Wait is not passed, use Ctrl-Alt-Escape to abort Wait.

If [2] - try the following: Next (Wfica, CirculateHit) Beep

If [3] - can you move this window at all using Move command (bound to a
key/menu)? If no, this window probably has "Override redirection?: Yes"
as seen in `xwininfo -all`. In this case the problem is in a window.

Regards,
Mikhael.

    Thanks for the testing info.  I had already done some testing using
Execs.  I have now used your methods to confirm what I've thought.  I've
verified that the Wait is passed, and that Next returns appropriately
(with both "W2000*" and "Wfica", btw).  The problem is that the Move
doesn't work.  However, xwininfo reports "Override redirection?: No" for
the window.  Additionally, I can pull up FvwmTalk after the window has
loaded, and the Next..Move command will work.

    I don't know much about X11, but I've got one possible explanation.
When the window first appears, it is centered on the screen.  xwininfo
shows that the program supplies a location and a size.  Is is possible
that the centering occurs after the Move 0 0 command executes, thereby
cancelling it out?  If so, is there a way around this?  The only other
explanation I have is a problem in Fvwm2.

Probably the following line after Wait may verify your guess:

  + I PipeRead `sleep 3`

Or try other ways to postpone Next..Move command, which, you say, works.

Not using a style. Just add the following line into your ~/.Xdefault:

  procmeter*geometry: 120x80+40+20

Yes it is possible too using FvwmEvent, see:

Great - when I see there is a new window, I guess
I will use the "Move" and "Resize" commands to set
its geometry?

I have run into a situation where I would like to change a window's
name (as shown in its title bar), and/or its icon name, without
shutting down and restarting the application.  Several hours of
digging into the manpage, FAQ, and source code have not turned
anything up.  Is there some command which could be issued via
FvwmConsole to perform this sort of operation?

In a window title and an icon title you see a real window name and a real
icon name, which your application supplied. Unless this application wants
to change its names dynamically, you can't change this in fvwm. As of now.

This is a well known bug in the 2.2.x series, it is fixed in
the 2.3.x series.

In the next beta 2.3.22 you can use a lot of variables (5120) and a
lot of widgets (1000). In the current beta 2.3.21 you can already
used 512 variables.

Because there are not real widget, there are "widget" which
write directly on the main widget.

Yes. Agree with you, but it is still the case in the betas
and will be probably the case in 2.4.

Olivier,

Thanks for the input!  Nothing to do now except wait for the next release :)

One more question I forgot to ask :

How do you do the keybinding for the "Start" menu and the "Start" key on the
keyboard ?

I haven't seen an example of this for 2.2.4 ....

Hmmm....yep
bell percent: 50   bell pitch: 400   bell duration: 100

I also have modules sound core, sound and sb installed - not sure what / who
is in control of the beeper

xkbbell doesn't work either  ...

Hello,

Context : GNU/Linux, fvwm-2.3.21, XFree 3.3.5, glibc-2.0.7

I have installed xrootconsole, a small utility that displays its input in a
text box transparently on the root window. This fancy utility is available
on <URL:http://wso.williams.edu/~bgallowa/xrootconsole/>.

My background is a complex pixmap and I use xrootconsole to monitor the
/var/log/messages file with the following command :

DestroyFunction InitFunction
AddToFunction InitFunction
+ I Exec exec tail -f /var/log/messages | xrootconsole

All works like a charm, *except* when I restart fvwm with the Restart
command. The xrootconsole window stays always on top of all others windows
and this is very annoying. This problems does not appear with others window
managers like sawfish and twm.

The same effect can be reproduced when starting another xrootconsole
manually (from a xterm by example) and restarting fvwm.

Here's the xwininfo of xrootconsole :

xwininfo: Window id: 0x1c00002 (has no name)

Absolute upper-left X:  0
Absolute upper-left Y:  760
Relative upper-left X:  0
Relative upper-left Y:  760
Width: 792
Height: 104
Depth: 16
Visual Class: TrueColor
Border width: 0
Class: InputOutput
Colormap: 0x23 (installed)
Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
Backing Store State: NotUseful
Save Under State: no
Map State: IsViewable
Override Redirect State: yes
Corners:  +0+760  -360+760  -360-0  +0-0
-geometry 792x104+0-0

Why this problem appears only when restarting fvwm and how to keep xrootconsole on the lowest layer ?

Thanks in advance.

This is a good place to ask. If you want to be aware of the developement
there is fvwm-workers@ list.

Use:

  *FvwmTaskBarStartMenu MenuFvwmRoot Root +1p o100-25p

You can start FvwmEvent and hook destroy_window event to something like:

  Desk 0 0

In 2.3 it can be done more effectivelly using PassId of FvwmEvent
and having in the hook function: WindowId $w ("MyApp") GotoDesk 0 0

> - or - any way to make the taskbar popup  when a window closes??

The same here. Just add this after/instead Desk command:

  Menu MenuFvwmRoot Root +1p o100-25p

In 2.2 this will change desk or/and pop up the menu after any window
closing, so you probably may want to have a function which first starts
FvwmEvent, then your application; in destroy_window: KillModule FvwmEvent.

Bell is translated by X Server to machine specific sound as far as I know,
for example directly to PC native speaker. Do you hear a bell after:

  echo [Press Ctrl-V][Press Ctrl-G][Press Enter]

Here is an example (this is explained in the 2.2 man page):

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc   WindowListFunc
  + "I" WindowId $0 FlipFocus
  + "I" WindowId $0 Raise
  + "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

Do you say FlipFocus does not work as expected? Please give more info.
The 'Key Tab A M' binding above doesn't work on my keyboard, fixed in 2.3.

Also in 2.3 you have built-in Alt-Tab (unless you redefine this), which is
what you want. And Tab inside WindowList (and other menus) works.

Seems like a problem. I fear it can't be solved without fixing the source.

You can submit a feature request for this via the bug tracking system.

First the bad news: it is the fault of the application.  It makes
its window "override redirect" which means that the window manager
does not know about it and can not properly stack other windows
above or below it. According to th ICCCM2 (the document describing
how applications and the window manager have to interact), only
transient windows like menus may be declared "override redirect".
Obviously xrootconsole violates this rule by making a permanent
window use this hint.

Now the good news: Fvwm has an option to work around the flawed
application's bug.  Try

  BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged on

In your config file.

Anyway, could you perhaps forward the discription of the bug above
to the developers of xrootconsole?

Is it possible for an FvwmForm button to clear the contents of an

By setting the action  on a button to "restart"  all the  form's input
fields are reset to their initial values.  Is that what you want?

Not really. I have some forms which have default values but I want
a button that will clear the form entries rather than resetting
them to their initial values.

Thanks a lot, it works perfectly now :-) Does it mean that sawfish is not
fully ICCCM2 compliant ? This problem can not be reproduced with this wm.

Yes, of course. I will try some hacks, the xrootconsole source is very
small.

Thanks.

Dear All,

I am fairly new to fvwm2, but I am gradually getting
the hang of doing minor customisations to the fvwm2
config. files. This question may seem stupid, but here
goes....

1. I have tried to get a program such as "kedit" to
load as an icon when I start up fvwm2. I did this by
using Style "kedit" StartsOnDesk 1 2, StartIconic.

This sometimes worked, and sometimes did not, why????
Is it something that I am doing wrong???

2. Another annoying thing, is that after it had
worked, kedit would iconify other windows aswell, i.e.
when I went to File ---> open, that open window would
iconify as well, is there away around this???

3. kedit does not seem to like the -geometry command.
How then do I load kedit in a windows position that I
choose????

I hope that all this is not too "common place"

Well, you will probably not find a single window manager and not a
single application that is completely ICCCM2 compliant.  The
problem that window manager authors have is that they have to work
with a multitude of buggy applications.  So we can not simply say
"fix it, your application is broken" because if we did this, only
one of two applications would run properly.  So we keep making
options to work around many bugs in applications but keep telling
the authors to fix them.

This is ok, but the '2' in StartsOnDesk has no meaning, this is evaluated
to 'StartsOnDesk 1'. Or you mean StartsOnPage? You may try SkipMapping.

If you start kedit at startup, for this to work, it is important that you
do this in InitFunction and not in .Xclients or .xinitrc.

Otherwise give more information. It works for me.

kedit sets not very helpful window and resource names for its windows.
You may try to check the names using FvwmIdent. Then use something like:

  Style "Open" StartNormal    # this should be after Style "kedit"

> 3. kedit does not seem to like the -geometry command.

Check other threads on this list. This will be in FAQ in several days.
But all kedit windows have resource name kedit and it seems impossible to
identify the main window, so you will have the same problems as in (2).

Also if you use FvwmEvent to set a geometry of kedit, you can call
'Next (kedit) Iconify true' in the same add_window event function.

You may want to ask kedit authors to implement -geometry, and to change
window name of the main window to "kedit - No File" or "kedit -
current.txt", so it would be possible to identify the main window only.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Dear All,

I have tried out the suggestions that Mikhael Goikhman
made in my last e-mail, but they don't seem to work
for me!!

I have the problem that kedit for example when ran as
an icon also minimises other windows, such as when you
click on file ---> open.

In the file defstylesfvwm2rc.m4, I put Style "kedit"
StartNormal, after I had put the style for kedit, but
it still minimises these windows. In fact, it is the
same for any K app that I run minimise.

Has anyone got any ideas???

I am using the  Lesstif WM (AnotherLevel) that shipped
with fvwm2.

In anticipation,

Regards,

Thomas Adam

This function seems to work for me:

DestroyFunc kedit
AddToFunc kedit
# I Style "kedit" StartIconic
+ I Exec kedit
+ I Wait kedit
+ I Style "kedit" StartNormal

I then start kedit using the function "kedit".

kedit seems to accept the command line flag "-iconic", but then ignores
it.  I don't know why.  Perhaps the KDE developers can explain why.

You can use a  button to recreate and  restart the form with new input
values.

I assume you know the keystroke ^k will clear an individual input field.

You can request an enhancement for another type of refresh.  You might
want to explain why this is useful if you make the enhancement request.

Mikhael,
Thanks for the input - things are starting to look "normal" - ahhhh!

Hey, while your here :-)  My start menu is almost there - but...

1.a  is there any way to bind the Start key on the keyboard to the Start menu
?

1.b is there any way to configure the start menu to remain on-screen after
an item with a sub-menu is clicked ?? If I click on "Programs..." the sub
menu
is displayecd, but the start menu disappears. - whoa..now where did that
get off to ??

Yep...works great - I even understand it after going back to read the manual.

Note, if the user extends the taskbar the window pops up at the same place,
overlaying the start button... might be a way to make it relative to the
taskbar window or some other trick....

Ok, I got nothing here....I don't know where to start or where to stick the
FvwmEvent
thing.  more manual reading is in order  :-(  What is the desk command ??

My application has  a style defined as:
Style "xxx"  border Width 0 , NoHandles, NoTitle, NoDecorHint, StartsOnDesk 2

from the StartMenu:
+ "xxx" Exec /usr/bin/xxx

from the Buttons in the pager:
*FvwmButtons (Title Xxx, Icon icons_bt.xpm, Action 'Exec /usr/bin/xxx')

Hmmm...this does nothing...I think there is some fundamental problem here
besides general operator error :-O

I'm using a Media GX with the sound, soundcore and sb modules installed...
any suggestions ? and how do you use these modules anyhow ??

The binding works and displays the window list as expected. However,
you have to use the mouse or cursor keys to pick a window.  Another Alt-tab
or even just the Tab key would be handy (as I expected to occur from the
FlipFocus option).

I guess I'll try to get the 2.3 stuff before I submit any bugs or

Thanks for the input - my start menu is now operating "reasonably" and
the Alt Tab feature has been added.

Dear Dan,

Thankyou for your suggestions about kedit.... it seems
to work ok, it there are just two more things that I
would like your help with....

1. Is it possible to make that Function generic for
any K app that is loaded, i.e. maybe by using
wildcards?????

2. Secondly, because Kedit (with your function you
supplied) loads at startup, if I shut down that
program, and then load it up again, it starts on the
page it is meant to, but it does not load as an icon,
instead it loads up as a window. So my question is,
once I shutdown kedit, how do I re-envoke the Function
again????

Thanks for your help,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

OK, none of this is tested, but I think you will get the idea:

# Start program iconic, first arg is program name, class/resource name
DestroyFunc ksicon
AddToFunc ksicon
# I Style "$0" StartIconic
+ I Exec $0
+ I Wait $0
+ I Style "$0" StartNormal


AddToFunc InitFunction I ksicon kedit
AddToMenu Utilities "Start kedit" ksicon kedit

I made the function I gave you earlier generic, used the function from
the InitFunction and from a menu.

Ok, I explain what I did, maybe it can be useful to someone.
I started xev and pressed my Start key. I got keycode 117 (it may be
different on your keyboard) and no keysym assigned with it.
Similarly, `xmodmap -pk | grep 117` gave no keysyms.

Then I executed `xmodmap -e 'keycode 117 = F13'`, i.e. assigned this key
to symbolic name F13, which is not used on my keyboard. Then started
FvwmConsole, executed the following and everything worked:

  Key F13 A A Menu MenuFvwmRoot Root +1p o100-25p

So, if I wanted to be annoyed by these extra keys I would just add this
"xmodmap -e .." command to my ~/.xinitrc or call it from InitFunction.

In 2.3, the default is what you want. In 2.2, this is not configurable.

You can also try 'Mouse c -100m' or so, but I think the first is better.

Desk (the new name is GotoDesk) changes the current desk.

Take a look at fvwm.org/generated/FAQ.html and read question 3.18 and 3.19.
I hope you will learn something useful.

It is really not fvwm specific, try to find about "bell in X" on internet.

Mikhael,
Wow - that worked great!
My "start" key was keycode 115, the "right mouse button" key is117...

Also, I just inserted the expression:

keycode 115 = F13

in my  .../xinit/Xmodmap file.

Of course, the application ("Citrix") is using the start key too  but now
X captures it first - proving once again that no good deed goes
unpunished :)

Thanks for all the help.  I'll check out the FAQ too...keep the noise
down on this list a little....

Later,
Ralph

I don't know.  Generally, using KDE applications outside
of KDE is a bad idea.  All these programs support only
kwm, the window manager that comes with KDE.  Many of
them are very *very* buggy and ignore about everything
that applications have to do to cooperate nicely with
other window managers.  When I started kedit to check
your problem, it froze X completely several times, flickered
a lot, raised its own windows over other newly mapped windows
and so on.  I recommend you do not use any KDE applications
with fvwm that cause you trouble (or you could switch
completely to KDE).

That is because of the stupid naming scheme of kedit.  Under X,
every window has a name (which is "kedit"), a resource name
(also "kedit") and a class name (also "kedit").  When you
create a style "kedit", this applies to all windows with a
matching name, class or resource.  Unfortunately all kedit
sub windows get the resource and class "kedit", so your
style applies to all su windows also :-P  Possible solutions
are:

 1) Give the main kedit window and the style a different name.
    No idea how to do this since KDE traditionally comes without
    any usable command line documentation.
 2) Explicitly disable the StartIconic style for the sub windows:

      Style Open StartNormal
      Style "Select Font" StartNormal
      ...
    This would only be a last resort since you have to list all
    window names manually.

I have no idea. kedit seems to ignore user preferences completely.
There is always the possibility to use FvwmEvent to move the newly
mapped window (try "man FvwmEvent).  Perhaps someone can provide
a sample config.

This is in the FVWM FAQ, question 3.18: http://fvwm.org/generated/FAQ.html
Of course, FAQ only accompanies a man page, not replaces it.

Thanks to the hard work of the wizards here, I've used fvwm1 and 2 for
years, recently switching to fvwm2 on RedHat Linux 6.2.  It's run fine for
months, but this morning, I came in to find myself logged out.  Very odd.
I looked at the output of "dmesg" and I saw:

VM: killing process fvwm2

Who is VM? (Virtual Memory?) Why did it kill my fvwm2?  How can I prevent
a repeat of this?

Thanks,

It's the virtual memory that ran out of memory and looked for a good
victim to get rid of.. Your fvwm2 ran out of luck and had to die. Linux'
Out-of-memory handler isn't very bright..

> How can I prevent a repeat of this?

Don't run out of memory ;P

I'm trying to install fvwm2.2.4 on a solaris 2.6 ultra
10 machine.  But when I run ./configure it runs
through most of the checks until it gets to setvbuf. 
I get an error msg and it stops there.  Here's part of
the log:

checking for putenv... yes
checking for select... yes
checking for setvbuf... yes
checking for socket... no
checking for waitpid... (cached) yes
checking for strdup... yes
checking for strstr... yes
checking for strtol... yes
checking for memmove... yes
checking for memcpy... yes
checking for strchr... yes
checking for sysconf... yes
checking for uname... yes
checking for div... yes
checking for sigaction... yes
checking for siginterrupt... yes
checking for sig_atomic_t... yes
checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed...
configure: error: can not run test program while cross
compiling


Any ideas?

It shouldn't think its "cross compiling".  Earlier it evaluates your
compiler.

You can compile with Sun's cc (if you've paid  for it, and its in your
path), or gcc.  Heres what I get on Solaris with gcc:

checking for gcc... (cached) gcc
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... yes
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) is a cross-compiler... no
checking whether we are using GNU C... (cached) yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... (cached) yes
checking how to run the C preprocessor... (cached) gcc -E

If it doesn't find gcc, it goes on to test cc.
What do you get?

And here's what I got with the native Sun compiler.

checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... cc
checking whether the C compiler (cc  ) works... yes
checking whether the C compiler (cc  ) is a cross-compiler... no
checking whether we are using GNU C... no

This will probably be much improved in Linux 2.4.x, when that comes out.

fvwm-2.2 versions require also c++ (or g++, cxx, cc++) compiler.
It is possible that you have it, but it is not installed propertly.

If this is the case, specify ./configure --without-cxx .
You will not have one minor module, written in C++.

fvwm-2.3 versions do not use C++.

Regards,
Mikhael.

So far I had a 9x9 desktop and the following key bindings:
Key 		Left	A	CM		Scroll -100 +0
Key		Right	A	CM		Scroll +100 +0
Key		Up	A	CM		Scroll +0 -100
Key		Down	A	CM		Scroll +0 +100

Now some considerations forced me to change my desktop to 3x3 disjoint
desktops. Unfortunately the keys won't work any more. Can I still get somehow
the same behaviour?

Martin

If you're using fvwm-2.2.x, use Desk.  If you're using fvwm-2.3.x, 
use GotoDesk.  Both are in the manpages for fvwm.  

Here you'd want to use (for fvwm-2.2):

# wrapping around between desks 0 and 8.
Key           Left      A       CM         Desk -1 0 8
Key           Right     A       CM         Desk  1 0 8
# going to current desk +/- number of desks in a row.
Key           Up        A       CM         Desk -3 0 8
Key           Down      A       CM         Desk  3 0 8

For fvwm 2.3.x, just replace Desk with GotoDesk.

Hi, I just installed the 2.2.4, but "all the stuff" stays in my download
directory.  The only thing that gets copied is the fvwm2 executable (as
it seems to me on a "locate"). I used

1. ./configure
2. make
3. make install

as root. Furthermore the machine starts up in "Afterstep" (because it
can't find fvwm2) - pretty anoying. I tried to catch it by editing the
.xinitrc (both home/me/.xinitrc and root/.xinitrc) but it still starts
in "Afterstep". Below is the Makefile, my first question on this one is
- did something goe wrong with the DESTDIR? (don't know the syntax for
makefiles). I use SuSE 6.3 and is setup to start fvwm2 in the rc.config.

Thanks in advance, nikolaj, copenhagen, denmark

If 'make install' didn't give you an error, everything is installed well.
To find what stuff is installed where, you can read INSTALL.fvwm.

Do you have /usr/local/bin (this is the default, can be configure'd)
in the PATH? Or do you use the full path to fvwm2 binary?

I am not familar with the SuSE setup, but I would think, it should respect
your ~/.xinitrc if you start X by xinit (or startx). Another possible
solution may be to have ~/.Xclients instead of ~/.xinitrc.
The contents of the file could be: exec /usr/local/bin/fvwm2

> DESTDIR =

This is ok.

Mikhael.

Hello Experts,

	Like many FVWM users, I use the right mouse button to bring
up a menu of currently active windows which I can then jump to by
selecting one.   My Question: Is there any way to prevent windowlist
from including windows with a given name.  For example I would like
to remove all windows named "xload" from the list, and thereby make
it more managable.  Thanks Much,

Chris

Hi to all...

I turned over from SuSE to debian. Under SuSE, the fvwm2 had a console,
which was titles "xmessages", and I want this in my selfcompiled fvwm2 under
debian, too.

How can I realize that?

thnx for help!

Jan

Howdy all!
	I've been trying to figure out if there is a programmatic way to
interface with the virtual desktop.  One cludge I thought up was to bind a
couple of keys to up, down, left, right, scrolling a certain number of
pixels each time the key is pressed.  Then I could generate key press events
in X.  I really thought this was a horrible hack though.  Can any one point
me in the right direction?

Perhaps "man FvwmCommand" is what you want.

If you are trying to get fvwm2 to launch "xmessages", you might try
adding:

AddToFunc InitFunction Exec xmessages

to your $HOME/.fvwm2rc

sorry, but I'm not familiar with Debian, SuSE, or xmessages.
Hope this is what you are looking for.

I'm a bit familiar with Debian, but not with SuSE, and I have never 
heard of 'xmessages'.  It sounds like a SuSE copped-up name for an 
xconsole to me.

The development version (2.3.x) supports GNOME.  You can also 
wait for the next stable version, 2.4.

Thanks for your input.  Unfortunately, I must not have been clear enough.  I
am aware of FvwmCommand and it's capabilities, but I wanted to make it clear
that creating key events to get FVWM to move the view point around the
virtual desktop is probably not a good idea.  I was hoping there was a more
direct way to do it, say with a function like:

	moveDesktop(int x, int y)

Seems like you want a C function gotoPage(px, py) in your application.

Well, you can do it using gnome window manager hints, like gnome pager
applets do it. More precisely, you should modify "_WIN_AREA" XAtom.
Or "_WIN_WORKSPACE", if you also want gotoDesk(n).

You can take a look at gnome.c in fvwm or gwmh.c somewhere on internet.

Still, system("FvwmCommand 'GotoPage 1 0'") is probably the easiest way.

Mikhael.

is there any way to make a window sticky, but only w/in a desk?  it does
not look like sticky can take any modifiers.

Hello,

Can I bind a key a keystroke such as CTRL-ALT-F1 to a single key so that
when for example I press the Menu key I am taken to the Linux text
console?

Thanks,

Neil

Why not just bind the menu key?

If the config. file /etc/X11/XF86Config has the keyboard set for

   XkbModel        "pc105"

(My point for mentioning this is that at work I have a 105 key keyboard
but the config file had "pc101" and the Menu key was not seen.)

then this works for me...

Key Menu        A       N       Popup "MenuFvwmRoot"

though I guess you'd want Exec ...

I don't think he wants exec, he's trying to generate keystrokes
that are handled by the Linux kernel (I believe).

Neil, I think you are asking this question on the wrong list.
I don't know the right one, but I'm pretty sure this is Linux kernel
stuff.  Even if fvwm did support generating synthetic keystrokes, I don't
think the kernel would see them.

CTRL-ALT-F1 works even when the x server isn't active.

Correction, ALT/META-F1 works in the standard linux console. XFree86
supports the CTRL-ALT-F1 key binding. You'd need to hack XFree86 to
get additional tty-switching capability, since XFree86 only supports
turning the existing CTRL-ALT-Fn bindings on and off. Neil might want
to look at the xfree86 mailing lists.

My PC keyboard doesn't have a META key.

I can switch between consoles with C-A-Fn without XFree86 running.

  there is a program called chvt (IIRC) that you can use to switch
virtual consoles, bind a key to that program (or is it the other way
around?)

  see man fvwm on how to bind the key (I guess you would use Exec)

Hi all,

     I have a problem with some key bindings. In fact, lately I
installed
"nedit" and with this application the keys Home, PageUp, PageDown
and End are not working any more. (I am using instead the NumLock
keys (7 for Home, 9 for PgUp, 1 for End and 3 for PgDn)). Is there
any way to make them work?

Workstation: Sun, Solaris 7, fvwm-2.2.4

Thanks

Hello all.  I'm running fvwm-2.2.4 on Solaris 8.  My
problem is that every time I open an xterm it hangs
for about 15 seconds and my .csrhc is read before it
luanches an xterm.

This is the command that I'm using to launch an xterm:

xgreen xterm -fg green -bg black -sb -sl 1000 &

It's really annoying having to wait for my desktop to
reload every time I open an xterm.  Anyone have any
suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

What does the "xgreen" command do?

My login  shell is ksh,  I'm using Solaris  8 on  an  Ultra 5.  xterms
start  pretty fast (less  than a   second),  but I still  prefer rxvt.
(color  PS1 strings, colorls,  and pixmap  backgrounds, not to mention
the reduced memory use.)

I've never used csh, but I've read that its not a good idea.
What do you have in your .cshrc that takes so long?
The bulk of your profile should be in your .profile (or .dtprofile).

Has your PATH gotten out of control?  Searching for things with a really
long path can slow things down.

  not sure what your problem is but here are few hints:

  try to run xterm like this:

  xterm -e top&

  that way .cshrc is not executed and you will find out if the delay is
becuase of xterm or because of .cshrc

  once you figure out where the problem lies, try either of these:

  - inspect .cshrc, comment out suspicious parts etc until you find out
the reason for delay (be sure to make a backup copy of /cshrc)

  - try to use different version of xterm, different terminal emulator
etc...

  btw what do you mean by "having to wait for my desktop to reload every
time I open an xterm"? does the whole desktop freeze? or only xterm?

  what's xgreen?

  btw this does not look like fvwm problem...

I used xkeycaps to configure my keyboard so my Menu key works fine.
Did I do the right thing?

I want fvwm to press CTRL-ALT-F1 for me when I press the Menu key.
I don't want a menu to pop up.

I am not very familiar with X Window technology intrinsics but I don't
see why it would not b possible. I thought X was such a complicated
beast that it would allow virtually everything.

The Menu key is not a META key. There are three keys that appeared on
common keyboards since the advent of MS-Win. These are the left meta
key, the right meta key, and the menu key. The meta keys are the one
with the windows logos on them. The menu key usually has a paper and
a pointer on it. For all I care it would be nice if it were even possible
to generate CTRL-ALT-F1 with some other key (such as F10).

In MS-Windows you can go to real DOS mode by selecting and entry from the
task bar and clicking a button. Wouldn't it be nice if we could switch
to the Linux console in a similar fashion, perhaps with FvwmTaskBar and
FvwmForm + whatever needs to be done to generate synthetic keystrokes.
There seems to be a problem with getting window managers to generate
synthetic keystrokes and synthetic mouse clicks. It would be nice to
know how this could be done.

  no, ignore the ctrl-alt-f1, use program chvt that does the same thing,
bind that program to menu key...

  see your fvwm config (probably ~/.fvwm2rc, but might be something
else) to see examples (probably) of key binding, just add one that would
bind pressing of the menu key to program chvt with appropriate argument.

  use chvt to switch to text virtual console, there is no need to
generate keystrokes (in this case)

  also, why is xterm not good enough?

I don't see your reasoning.  Just because X is complicated, it doesn't
mean that it does everything.

My statement was that if you generated the synthetic keystroke C-A-F1,
it would never get to the VT driver that normally intercepts C-A-F1
and cause the action you are looking for.
I still think thats a correct statement.

Erik identified chvt as the name of a program that does communicate
with the VT driver so I would guess that you can use that program
to do everything you want.

The subject of having fvwm generate synthetic keystrokes comes up
from time to time.  Someday fvwm may do that.  It could be in the
core fvwm, or in a module.  I don't know what the advantage to building
it into fvwm would be though, it would be just as easy to have
an external program do it.  You could pass the program the window
ID and the keystroke you wanted, something like:

Exec unidentifiedProgram -w $w '^C ^[ k'

I am running XFree86 3.3.6-10 and the F? virtual window manager
2.2.4-2 which makes use of the alt key in conjunction with the 
function keys.

Seemingly at random X switches from sending these keypresses to 
fvwm to sending them straight to the client processes.

This is frustrating, esp. since I am setting up some public access
terminals which I would like to keep user-friendly.

Read the information in the FAQ that mentions numlock.
Does that help?

I'll betcha the random times oh-so-coincidentally occur just after
you've toggled your NUMLOCK key (or perhaps CAPSLOCK key)... right? :)

Check the FAQ.

Thanks for telling me about the chvt program which I was not aware of.
Now everything makes sense except for you need to be root to run chvt.

Thanks,

  hmmm... that's annoying,

  you can use sudo (see man sudo) to allow certain users to execute
chvt...

Dan,

I need you help once again!!! Remember when you helped
me write all those functions to allow K-apps to run
minimsied??? Well, it works fine, except for two
things:

1. how do I impliment it so that the K-app adheres to
those customisations but the k-app does not lauch at
startup?

2. There is a weird things, whereby when I load into
the window manager, one k-app starts minimised, but in
order for the other k-apps to appear, I have to
un-iconify one so the other loads, and then when that
one has loaded, I have to un-iconify that one to get
the other one loading, etc.....how do I stop this???

WIA,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

Send them to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.  I'm assuming that you want to add
one to http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/index.html.

We can deal with the thumbnail, but include any text you would like
to appear.

I'm trying to get pager to work but it just will not
launch when I log into my system (ultra 1 Solaris 8). 
I'm fairly new at fvwm2 which makes it difficult to
understand why.  

I've tried using someone else's fvwm2rc who is using
Pager fine but it still will not launch. 

Could it be cuz my default shell is csh?  I noticed
that I don't have an .xinitrc file either.. could that
be the problem?  

Thanks in advance.

Nope, we get so many questions, if I remember half of them
I would explode.  (I only remember it vaguely, I think
we created  a function to start the app.)

If you added the function to your InitFunction and don't
want it there.  Put it somewhere else.  For example if you
want it in your Utility menu:

AddToMenu "Utility" "Kedit" KStart Kedit

We'd have to see the function.

csh should have nothing to do with it.  You don't start
FvwmPager from the command line, nor do you "Exec" it from
your .fvwm2rc.

You haven't supplied enough information.

What version of fvwm are you using.

How are you starting X?  What did you do about CDE?
If you are starting X from your .profile, what command did
you use?

Well I'm not trying to start FvwmPager through the
command line.

I basically installed fvwm2 the way the directions
tell me to.  I haven't touched .cshrc and I don't have
a .profile, but I do have a .dtprofile.

I remember having a small problem running ./configure 
I was getting the following error:
configure: error: can not run test program while cross
compiling

So someone told me to run ./configure with the
following options:
./configure --without-cxx

He said that running this would eliminate a minor
module written in C++

The version of fvwm is 2.2.4

I was using fvwm on another system (ultra5) and the
way I used to launch fvwm was by login into command
line mode and then typing the command "startx" and
that would automatically launch fvwm.  But on this
system (ultra 1 solaris 8) when I execute startx it
says command not found, can't do a man startx either.

So I found a site that showed me how to add fvwm to my
CDE login screen.  So now when I'm at the login screen
I go to options/session/fvwm and wala fvwm comes up
fine but with no pager.

Here's the site that showed me how to add fvwm to my
win manager list

http://twirl.mcc.ac.uk/~zzassgl/wm.html

Could this be why?  Thanks for your help.

Solaris doesn't come with startx.  No surprise there.

The information at that site is good.
This explains why you don't need a .xinitrc, the script
adapts to that and starts fvwm2 instead.

To get FvwmPager to start with Fvwm2.4, you are going to need
a correct ModulePath and good configuration commands and
a command to start FvwmPager.

It will also help if we can see any error messages that might be
getting printed.

Modify the script described in Step 4 where it invokes fvwm2:

Before:  /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 &
After:   /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 2>&1 | tee /tmp/xinit.out&

Look in /tmp/xinit.out from time to time to spot problems.

Assuming FvwmPager is in /usr/local/fvwm  you need in your .fvwm2rc:

ModulePath /usr/local/fvwm
*FvwmPagerBack gray
*FvwmPagerFore black
*FvwmPagerFont 9x15bold
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8bold
*FvwmPagerHilight lightblue
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1-1
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Main
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Alt
*FvwmPagerDeskColor 0 blue
*FvwmPagerDeskColor 1 green
*FvwmPagerMiniIcons
*FvwmPagerBalloons

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmPager 0 1

(The *FvwmPager lines can be whatever you want, I'm just giving you
what I have set.)

Thanks!
It's nice to see a happy ending to these threads.
Now, if I could just get sideways title bars, I'd be happy.  ;)
Still waiting...

Hello, I have a problem in customizing my titlebar. I'm trying to
get fvwm2 (2.3.21) look like twm, and I can't find in the fvwm2
manual page the solutions to the following problems:

1. Erase relief around buttons, making them part of the titlebar.
ButtonStyle All -- Flat doesn't seem to do the trick.

2. A border (say, 5 pixels) around buttons and title of the window,
title background included.

3. The TiledPixmap background on the title should start after the
window title.

To make things simpler to understand I've just put online a couple
of images of the two title bars.

http://www.swlibero.org/~nikke/junk/twm-titlebar.xpm (This is how it
should look like.)

http://www.swlibero.org/~nikke/junk/fvwm-titlebar.xpm (My current
configuration.)

You could try something like:

Style * HandleWidth 3
Style * ForeColor White, BackColor #22aa99
Style * HilightFore White, HilightBack #22aa99
Style * Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
TitleStyle  TiledPixmap pattern.xpm -- Flat
TitleStyle  LeftJustified Height 20
ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap button.xpm -- Top Left Flat
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap button2.xpm -- Top Right Flat
BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset Flat
Mouse 0 1 Nop
Mouse 0 2 Nop

the only problem is, I dont think its possible to make the 
tiledpixmap avoid the title text.

good luck,
sa

Well, I didn't expect the configuration and pixmaps attached, it's
been very kind of you indeed. I feel rude for my request, now ;-)

Thanks a lot again,

While writting this answer, I see that S. Anderson already answered you.
Still I think some info may be helpful.

You should make both title and buttons flat.

This is configured by TitleStyle Height.

This is not possible as of now.
You can play with "TitleStyle Pixmap -- right" though.

Here is a better emulation (there is rc file in the same directory):

Hello,

I am having problems under FVWM2 using Alt-? hot keys
with Java GUI interfaces.  It doesn't work.  For
example, I have a File menu where the user can hit
Alt-F to bring up the File menu interface.  This works
fine under Gnome / Enlightenment but fails under
FVWM2.

I'm using IBM's JDK 1.1.8 and Swing 1.1.1.

I used the "xmodmap" command as suggested in the JDK
README file and that did the trick under Enlightenment
but under FVWM it failed.

Anyone have any experience using Java and FVWM that
could help me out?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi, 

This question has probablly been asked a millions times.

I would like to use keys to switches virtual desktops easily.  I read
the faq, and the keys supplied only switch a desktop by moving the
mouse pointer.

Is there another way to do this?

Any insight appreciated.

Fvwm won't interfer with  application key bindings  unless you tell it
to.

Look in your .fvwm2rc for a line like

Key f ? ? xxx

hi nick

i use ctrl-shift and qwer/asdf/yxcv for switching my 12 desktops. this
is nice with the thumb on ctrl-shift :) additionally i use alt-shift
with those 12 keys to move a window to one of the desktops. its fast and
very efficient.

below my configuration:

Key q A SC GotoPage 0 0
Key w A SC GotoPage 1 0
Key e A SC GotoPage 2 0
Key r A SC GotoPage 3 0
Key a A SC GotoPage 0 1
Key s A SC GotoPage 1 1
Key d A SC GotoPage 2 1
Key f A SC GotoPage 3 1
Key y A SC GotoPage 0 2
Key x A SC GotoPage 1 2
Key c A SC GotoPage 2 2
Key v A SC GotoPage 3 2

Key q A SM MoveToPage 0 0
Key w A SM MoveToPage 1 0
Key e A SM MoveToPage 2 0
Key r A SM MoveToPage 3 0
Key a A SM MoveToPage 0 1
Key s A SM MoveToPage 1 1

  I'm running a 2.3.20 snapshot, Sparc/Solaris 2.6.

  I've just come across an app. that - well, it's nasty. (for reference,
it's Rational 'Rose' developement tool).

  The previous versions of this weren't pleasant, but at least pretended
to be X apps. This latest version basically comes up as if it were a
Windows app. displaying on my X display - the whole window is
override-redirect meaning I have to use the two related BugOpts just to be
able to do anything else (raise/lower, etc.).

  The window itself draws it's one windows-alike title bar, buttons, the
lot. Even iconising it doesn't. It simply shrinks the window it's got (I
seem to recall it uses the *same* window, just icon-sized!).

  Yeugh.

  Anyway, apart from the obvious "what on Earth can I do about it?" (aside
from try in vain to get Rational to change their ways, which I reckon is a
complete non-starter, ...

  Is this a sign of things to come? Looking at it, a couple of libraries
it comes with are things like libshlwapi.so and libadvapi32.so, which I've
not come across before, but seem to be related to similarly named .DLLs
and maybe even WINE stuff.

  Does this portend more & more apps. developed for Windoze, and then
WINEd to UNIX, using a Windows GUI only?

  What makes it worse for me is that the current prevailance here is for
CDE (the Solaris default), which, of course, manages override-redirect
main windows [by the looks of it] and seems to cope. Some people use KDE,
and they seem to be ... accepting it, so I guess it does too. I've not
tried GNOME/Sawfish yet (will in a mo. - but my processor won't take it as
a day-to-day WM), which Sun may put in the next Solaris.

  So I've not got much argument here for the app. to be 'fixed' - they'll
tell me to use CDE like everyone else :-(


  Any thoughts or 'libshlwapi'-related revelations?


  ----

[later]

 - Oh god! It's created a ~/windows as well, with a registry database. I'm
losing the will to live ...

 - And it gets worse; it wants so many colours that, on my 8-bit-deep
display, it uses it's own colourmap, and sets it to be that initially
(messing the other apps.' colours). But since FVWM can't 'see' it's
window, it seems to not that that the colourmap's different, and I have to
resort to running the pointer over 'xcolor' to change the installed
colourmap.

 - And stranger. CDE creates the apps. windows *without* override-redirect
set!! Is that a known 'feature' of CDE????

 - GNOME/Sawfish suffers the same problem [less the colourmap thing, which
it sorts out when I click on a window]. It's slightly worse, since it
doesn't appear to have the BugOpt-option equivalents. Or it might if I
could be bothered to learn Lisp :-/

Oh yeah, now I remember, I wrote a FAQ entry for this.

Searches don't seem to be working on our mail archives.

This came   up in  September,   you can browse   the September archive
(search for   "rose") for all  the  details.  Heres the  part that may
help:

  Rational Rose  uses some software from Mainsoft  that  lets MS Windows
  applications be recompiled to run on UNIX.
  
  There seem to be 2 Mainsoft Knowledgebase pages that relate to UNIX
  window managers:
  
  http://www.mainsoft.com/nbase/mainwin/kb/kbmw0027.htm
  http://www.mainsoft.com/nbase/mainwin/kb/kbmw0034.htm
  
  The second page looks like it might help, try
  exporting MWWM=allwm before you run your application.
  
  You might also try MWWM=MWM.  With this it would make sense to tell
  fvwm to respect MWM decor hints.
  
  I think the fvwm-workers list would be interested in any results you
  can tell us about.

Ray then reported that MWWM=allwm seemed to work best.

I think you are correct in your guess that you may see more of these
applications.  Make sure you let Rational know how you feel about
their application defaults.

Here is some sample code if there are any Java
programers who wish to take a look.  I'm using IBM's
JDK 1.1.8 and Swing 1.1.1 but if you use something
else I'd like to know if it works for you.

I don't have any "key" entries in my .fvwm2rc file.  I
do use xmodmap to remap some keys (as suggested in
IBM's JDK README file).

Exec exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e "keycode 22 =
BackSpace" -e "keysym Alt_L = Alt_L" -e "keysym Alt_R
= Alt_R"

  Grief! Yes, sorry, I hadn't even considered that the FAQ's be kept that
up to date! <slap-hands>.

  I'll follow that up, thanks.


  BTW - for reference, those two mainsoft URLs are already out of date!

I use Slackware 7 with fvwm95-2.0.43b.

It is fine on the whole but I think I have discovered a bug with
scrolling: I cannot mouse-drag the scroller thumb on the left of any
xterm shell window. Sometimes, but not always I can scroll with
SHIFT+PAGEUP and SHIFT+PAGEDOWN. This has not bothered me in the past
but now I want to use XFM and 
double click on, say, an image file and get it displayed under an
appropriate viewer that I can configure with $HOME/.xfm/xfmrc. But for
this to be of any use I need to be able to scroll through some rather
large directories.

So the questions are (1) Will upgrading cure the bug? (2) Can I upgrade
just by downloading and installing a later version without first
uninstalling the existing version? (3) What precautions do 
I need to take about my existing configuration files such as the
.fvm95rc files?

As I think you are aware, fvwm95 is a very old fork of fvwm2 and
was never part of fvwm2.

As far as I know, fvwm2 is now able to do everything fvwm95 does.

The 2 config files  are very similar,  I suggest  you just  rename the
file and see what falls out.

I don't see how changing window managers will help.  This doesn't sound
like a window manager issue.

When keys and buttons stop working, its sometimes helpful to check
your NumLock, ScrollLock settings.

This might be a dumb question but here it goes.  

I'm trying to get a bigger button bar on my desktop
but I can't seem to find what settings I need to
change in my .fvwm2rc file to get a bigger button bar.

Can someone tell me what settings I need to tweek to
get a bigger button bar?  I looked at the manpages
already and some sample fvwm2rc files but it's still
over my head!

BTW I have fvwm 2.2.4

Laters!

I think FvwmButtons gets bigger if you put bigger things in
it.  Perhaps it would help if you showed us your current
configuration and explained what part you want bigger.

The FVWM button bar is created by the FvwmButtons module, so you want to
look at the FvwmButtons man page for information on configuring it.

However, FvwmButtons sizes the button bar to be as large as is needed by
the buttons it contains, including their pixmaps and labels (plus some
border stuff, etc.)

What do you mean by "bigger button bar"?  You mean, you want the buttons
to be bigger?  Or to have space between them?  Or the pictures to be
larger?  Or what?

Well, the FvwmButtons man page on my system lists several options that
should be of interest to you:

  * FvwmButtonsButtonGeometry, which lets you set a geometry for a
    single button.  So, you can make each button be a specific size if
    you like.

  * Or, FvwmButtonsPadding can increase the padding between the edge of
    the button and its contents (normally this is 2 pixels).

There may be others; check the man page.

Or, you can find larger pixmaps and use those instead of the ones you
have, then FvwmButtons will automatically increase the size of your
button bar accordingly.

You can replace this line with something like:

  *FvwmButtons(2x1, Size 150x80, Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager * *")

Or specify geometry for the full button bar:

  *FvwmButtonsGeometry 500x400-0+0

To me, this sounds like the standard behaviour of old X applications
like xterm, xfm, and friends.  Their scrollbars do not behave like
scrollbars in Motif, tcl/tk, and so on.  Instead, you click with the
left mouse button to scroll down, right mouse button to scroll ab, and
you can drag with the *middle* mouse button.

If you want a standard scrollbar, try rxvt instead of xterm.  Of
course, this won't help with xfm.

> So the questions are (1) Will upgrading cure the bug?

Upgrading fvwm won't help, since this is not an window manager
problem.  Window managers manage windows, not their contents.

If you install from the source, you should be able to specify
different directories for the modules and the manpages.  On SuSE
systems, you can have fvwm1 and fvwm2 at the same time.
