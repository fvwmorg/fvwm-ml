Would you stop doing this?  You've already gotten me in enough trouble
with this CleverPlacement stuff :-)  If you're not careful, I might end up
implementing the damn thing :-)  Actually I thought about this too
(believe it or not), not with regards do deiconification since I rarely
iconify stuff, but I was thinking it would be a handy title-bar button
(Replace).  And as you say, it would also be handy when windows are
deiconified.  This shouldn't be too hard to implement. 

As for the tile function, I considered that but there are a few more
complications with this one.  First, you likely wouldn't want all of your
windows to be replaced, so an additional attribute would probably be
required for things like FvwmButtons (NOREPLACE).  Second, how would you
go about replacing the windows?  For optimum placement, you would probably
want to do something like place the largest windows first and the smallest
last.  But this might drive you nuts trying to find where all of your
windows were placed.  Another possibility would be to replace the windows
trying to stay as close to the original placement as possible.  This would
be much more difficult.  This type of function would probably be more
suitable as a module.

Hi,

I'm trying to compile fvwm 2.43 with a Decstation 5000/200 running
ultrix4.4.  Runing xmkmf in the fvwm root directory results in the
following error:

/clients/users/nath/src/fvwm-2.0.43> xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
cfe: Error: : 3: Cannot open file Imake.tmpl for #include

Does anyone know how to fix this, or does anyone have makefiles for
Ultrix4.4?

-thanks for your help.

Have you ever seen the Caldera desktop "Looking Glass" (lg) on linux?
It can be configured as a single window covering the whole screen
background. At the top of this window is a menubar and a toolbar with
icons. The rest of the window is used like MS-Windows' progman:
you can drop icons there and later start programs by double clicking
on them.
This application and similar ones would greatly benefit from the
proposed StaysOnBottom style. For now "lg" just lowers its window
whenever another window is lowered below it.

Hi All:

I am having this wierd problem with autoraise.  I have autoraise set on all 
my windows. OK, here is the scenario - I have netscape running and I click on
one the buttons say "File" and a drop-down menu comes up, however as soon as
I move the mouse to select from one of the options in the menu, the pull-menu
goes under the Netscape window (Autoraising it, I guess).  This is the case 
with all appications with transient pull-downs. I am running fwvm-2.0.42a.

Please CC me on the reply. Thanks

Prasad

Quite annoying, isn't it?  Anyway, this seems to be a little better in 2.0.43,
but it's still there.

I'm not sure how the Motif toolkit works, but MetaCard's toolkit looks
for that configureNotify message to signify that it's OK to actually
open the override window.  My recollection is that Xt/Motif does

> Why does the ClickToFocus automatically come with a window raise, anyway? 

The idea here is to bring the menu bar (which may be in the main app
window) to the top so that you can get to all the menus.  It's also
pretty ugly to see a menu panel open "sandwiching" another window
between it and the window with the menu button in it.

Unless you click in its menu bar, in which case it *will* raise (at
least if it's a Motif or MetaCard application).

The wm is responsible for raising the window in most cases and so
"autoRaise" is still an important feature.  But since the menu bar has
to be on top when you open a menu panel, the WM has to be able to
respond properly when the app does an XRaiseWindow.  Fvwm currently
doesn't.

As I've offered before, I'm still willing and able to help work
through this one, but don't know fvwm (or any wm) internals well
enough to do it myself.

    Scott

I'm sorry you see it this way.  The *sole* goal of my posts on this
subject has been to get the default .fvwm2rc file be set up for
ClickToFocus.  Though I've been dragged into a little bickering with
the pointer focus zealots, even that has been just to emphasize the
point that this is not an issue that can just be ignored and that the
decision about the default is an important one.

But I'm not suggesting we change any other WM: either they use
explicit focus by default or don't have a sufficient installed base
that it makes any difference.  FVWM, mostly by virtue of its
popularity on Linux systems, is becoming common enough that the number
of bug reports we get relating to it has become an issue for us.  This
also means that it's installed base is large enough that it's time to
start thinking about what's best for the largest number of users.

Unless you're willing recommend we change the default, or argue that
default focus policy doesn't matter, I think further discussion on
this issue is warranted.

Like the fact that Motif applications sometimes open menus *under*

So you're suggesting that application vendors should port to fvwm,
rather than fvwm support industry standard APIs?  This attitude is why
the UNIX desktop market never took off: too many incompatible versions
of UNIX, and too little consideration given to how difficult it is to
support them.  Perhaps you're satisfied with a very limited choice of
applications, and the fact that many (most?) Motif applications don't
work correctly under fvwm, but I'll bet most other people aren't.

So now you're speaking for all fvwm users, and are "Chuck's" scheduler
too?  Pardon me, I was operating under the apparently mistaken
assumption that there are thousands or tens of thousands of people
using fvwm that might want to learn about these issues and make an
informed decsion, or have an informed decision made on their behalf.

This isn't just a problem with motif applications -- the same thing
happened to me today with xfontsel.

Scott, your tone does not present a very promising image for your company. 
If it is any indicator of the kind of customer support one can expect, I
know that I won't be buying your software.

Chuck, would you please change the default .fvwm2rc so he'll JUST SHUT UP!

Actually, I think you would find our technical support to be first
rate (you're welcome to ask on the metacard-list if you're curious).
While it may appear that I enjoy being irritating and pigheaded, like
most of you, I'd just as soon not deal with any of this.  We don't
even use fvwm here.

But customers, and potential customers, of ours have reported problems
running MetaCard under fvwm, and in order to provide quality technical
support, we're doing what we can to find solutions to their problems.
I suspect that you all would appreciate having a company go to bat for
you like this if you weren't on the receiving end of it ;-)

> Chuck, would you please change the default .fvwm2rc so he'll JUST SHUT UP!

Unfortunately, the setting in the default .fvwm2rc is the least of our
problems, as was clear in my original post.  In hindsight, adding the
"explicit-focus default" recommendation to that original post was a
mistake, because it has diverted attention from the real problems we
(and our customers) face.  As was the case for reporting the problems,
the purpose of the recommendation was just to make learning and using
fvwm easiest for the greatest number of people.

I'd love to drop the focus policy debate and get on with the business
of finding fixes or workarounds for the problems described in that
original post.  I'll second your motion to having a default fvwm2rc
file in the distribution set up for explicit focus.  Let's move on.
Here's the list again (this time without the distracting focus policy
recommendation):

1) fvwm doesn't handle active focus applications correctly, and it is
very difficult to navigate between MetaCard windows because of this.

2) fvwm doesn't handle the problem of raising windows that open menus
properly.  In some applications this means that menus sometimes open
under the main window.  In MetaCard, the symptom is a delay between
when the user clicks and when the menu panel opens.

3) fvwm doesn't support the mwm or olwm properties indicating that a
window is a modal dialog.  This problem is particular bad in MetaCard,
but it affects all Motif applications that open modal dialogs (which
is most Motif applications that I know of).

As I've said before, we're willing to help anyone locate and fix these
problems, but no one here knows WM internals well enough that we can
justify the time it would take to locate and fix them ourselves.

    Scott

I seem to have a strange problem. The Position of the FvwmWinList module
on the root window drifts as I switch between the different disjoint desktops.
This only happens when the two desktops have names of varying length which
are longer than the names of all the other windows. Could somebody else
try this out and see if they have the problem ?

To reproduce this add these lines to your .fvwm2rc (they should override
whatever you have currently specified).

-------- cut here -------------
Style "FvwmPager" BorderWidth 1, WindowListHit
Style "FvwmWinList" BorderWidth 1

*FvwmPagerGeometry -0+90
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 36
*FvwmPagerRows 2
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Pager:Local
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Pager:Remote

*FvwmWinListGeometry -0+300
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList                                      
*FvwmWinListMaxWidth 200
*FvwmWinListUseIconNames
------ cut here ----------------------

After restarting,the windowlist should appear flush with the right side of
the screen and should show the desktop you are currently on (either Pager:Local
or Pager:Remote). Ensure that no other window has a name longer than these
two. Now click on one of the 9 virtual desktops on Desk "Pager:Remote" then
on "Pager:Local" and back to Pager:Remote. Do this a couple of times. On
my setup the windowlist slowly moves a couple of pixels to the left and
to the top with each set of clicks.

I was using 2.0.42 initially and I just downloaded 2.0.43 and the problem
still exists.

Hi folks

We are using the fvwm2/fvwm95 on our DEC 3000 machines at the university
of Wuppertal. We have about 20 DECs running ATHENA as a scientific sub -
domain and the fvwm is much more powerfull than the standard MWM.
I had problems while installing the FvwmConsole for fvwm95 (ver. 2.0.43)
and while trying to send my mail to the fvwm95 guru "barth" I had to
find out that the Fvwm95 site is "404 Not Found".
By the way, this is for about two weeks now and your official home page
also still has a link to "http://ltiwww.epfl.ch/~barth/fvwm95.htm".

Can you tell me the new location of a fvwm95 home page if there is one?
Or do you have some more information about the fvwm95?
The fvwm2 (ver. 2.0.43) is running fine.

Thanks for your help in advance

It's my opinion that such a "tile" operation would be best provided by
an external module (FvwmTile?) rather than put into the fvwm main code. 
The main code's big enough as is without tacking on yet another "special
function" into it.  Please don't take this as a disagreement from me on
the utility of such a function.

However, you might want to consider what would happen if some windows'
sizes get too small to be useful when they are tiled.  For instance, I
see very little utility in having an xterm or editor window resized to
20 columns.  That is the one reason that I personally only rarely use
the "tile" feature on Windoze or Macintosh systems.

If I have xv running, and displaying an image, then restart fvwm, the
window that is displaying the image gets moved to the upper-left corner of
the screen. 

This doesn't happen with other windows when I restart fvwm -- is something
wrong with xv?

Yes, I think I module would be much better idea.  As has been pointed out,
finding a good tiled arrangement is not simply a matter of placing replacing
all the windows.  I can see may places for configuration, like what part
of the screen to fill first, that would make a function overly complex and
bloated.

I was thinking that the windows' sizes would remain unchanged.

Hello fvwm'ers. I am trying to start specific applications in specific
windows on the pager (my desktop is currently set to 2x2 i.e. 4 pages) But
when I try to use the StartsOnDesk x Style command, it puts it on a
completely different desktop rather than a window on the current one...
Can someone please tell me how to do this? Thanx
Todd

fvwm seems to be able to display all of the colors in the rgb.txt file,
but in my personal .fvwm2rc file, when I specify colors to modules, for
example 
*FvwmPagerHilight SteelBlue4

returned the error
FvwmPager: can't alloc SteelBlue4

For all the colors that return errors, black is substituted instead.
Interesting enough, when I use read, blue, white, or black instead of
SteelBlue4, it works.

The following in my .fvwmrc file does work though:
HilightColor          linen SteelBlue4

I know I'm not understanding something about how colors work.  Could it be
that the color configuration on my machine is incorrect?  I'm using a
DECstation 5000/200 running ultrix4.4 and I'm using fvwm-2.0.43. 

Thanks in advance for help,

Are you running netscape or some other app that fills up the color map? 
If so, you will have to run those apps with a more spare color map or
with a private color map.  For instance:

	netscape -ncols 64	# run netscape with at most 64 colors

Sounds pretty RTFM'ish to me.  I don't think you have multiple desks.  I
think you have a 2x2 virtual desktop with only one desk.  

StartsOnDesk is for Starting on a different Desktop.  To start on a
different page of the present Desk you will have to specify the geometry
of the window by adding multiples of your screen width/height to get it
where you want.

There was a talk of a StartsOnPage flag but I believe it's waiting on
the infamous "Great Style Flag Re-Write (tm)"

  This is really annoying.  Is it just on SunOS/Solaris?  I would be really 
  surprised if it were the case on all OS's and not fixed for so long...

No, it happens to me on linux.  But I think I've found out more on how it
happens.

I can get it to happen every time if I do this.

1. Unfocus a window with popups, like netscape.
2. Give the window focus.
3. Make a popup window appear.

If you do 3 before the autoraise timeout from 2, then netscape will autoraise
over the popup.  If the netscape window has had the focus for 250 ms, or
whatever you have your autoraise time set to, then there is no problem.

If you are using clicktofocus, I imagine that this is really annoying, as
everytime you cause an unfocused application to pop up a window it will get
obscured.

I haven't checked the FvwmAuto code, but I'm guessing it's something like this:

1. Get notified of a focus change
2. Set a timer
3. When the timer expires, raise the window.

Here is a few ideas on how to fix it.

1. Don't set the timer in step 2 unless the window isn't on top.  Is seeing if
a window is on top "easy"?  I would think is is.  This won't help the
problem directly, but is a good idea I think.

2. An application should never be raised above its popup windows.  I notice
I an open URL dialog from netscape is always placed on top of the netscape
window, even if I lower netscape.  Can't this be done for popup windows too?

Hello,

I think I've found a bug in all recent fvwm2 versions (this includes fvwm95
and Bowman up to 2.0.42, too). When a toplevel window gets resparented by
another widget, fvwm2 doesn't remove the decorations of the reparented
toplevel. fvwm1, mwm and tvwm behave correctly in this case.

I've remarked this error when I've started tgdb 2.6 (the new version of
our graphical gdb interface) under fvwm95. tgdb has a "debugee window"
which provides I/O for the program to debug. This window is a Xterm
that is reparented by a Tk frame widget and packed into another toplevel.
Unfortunately, the Xterm decorations won't disappear and fill the whole
background of the current screen. You can reproduce this even with the
old tgdb version 1.4 (you can find it on sunsite.unc.edu in the
/pub/Linux/devel/debuggers directory).

Does anyone know about this bug? Is there possibly a workaround? We'd like
to release tgdb 2.6 very soon, but only if we can be sure that it also
works on fvwm2 and other WMs based on this version. Please let me know
what develops (I'm not subscribed to the mailing list, so I'd apprectiate
sending me email).


Thanks very much,
mike

	I've been annoyed with windows autoraising over their pop-ups for
some time now, and I finally looked at the FvwmAuto module.  It was really
screwed up, I must say.  So I mostly rewrote it, my much cleaner version is
at ftp://s5-171-9.student.washington.edu/pub/fvwm/FvwmAuto.c

	There doesn't seem to be anyway to find out if a window is unobscured. 
What FvwmAuto was doing was listen to all raise events, and assuming that the
last raised window was the one and only unobscured window.  This didn't work
because after a window gets raised, a whole bunch of other windows get raised
as well.  Some of them are StaysOnTop windows, and some I can't find.  Maybe
they are window borders?  Anyway, what FvwmAuto was doing to keep track of 
unobscured window didn't work at all, so I took it out.

	Is their anyway to find out if a window is obscured?  Say have
FvwmAuto sent a copy of any VisibilityPartiallyObscured events that come
along?  Seems like maybe fvwm should keep track though.  It is raising
StaysOnTop windows eveytime a window is raised, even if they aren't obscured.

	Of course this still doesn't solve the real problem, raising a window
raises it above its popups as well.  This isn't a problem with FvwmAuto, but
with Fvwm.

Ashutosh,

The fvwm modules aren't being found in their default locations
(i.e. /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/FvwmWinList is non-existent, or it's permissions
are wrong).  You can specify where the modules are in your .fvwmrc file
via

ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm (or wherever your modules live)

	Not really. AutoRaise seems to be strictly a FocusFollowsMouse
nicety, which allows you to minimize the redraw thrashing you would get if
every window you passed over while traversing the screen got needlessly raised
as soon as focus entered the window. It has no use in clicktofocus mode, where
your mouse click unambiguously says "Hey, I really want to be here, I'm not
just passing through." Since I use clicktofocus and no autoraise delay, I never
experience any of the problems discussed in this thread.

	I wonder if what is really wanted here is a FocusDelay interval in
place of AutoRaise, which might serve the same useful purpose as AutoRaise
without putting the hart before the course, as it were.

	Is that worth some thought? Or is there some further subtlety of the
usage of AutoRaise that I'm missing, as a non-user?

	- Bob

Well, I implimented a replace function.  It was actually quite simple.  What
is does is call CleverPlacement to find a new spot to stick a window.  You
will need Anthony Martin's CleverPlacement replacement for placement.c.  Some
suggested uses of it:

# have windows find a nice spot when they de-iconify
AddToFunc "Iconify-and-Replace" "C" Iconify
+              "C" Replace

Mouse 1         I       A       Function "Move-or-Iconify"
Mouse 2         I       A       Function "Iconify-and-Replace"
Mouse 3         I       A       Function "Iconify-and-Replace"           

# double click on title bar replaces the window
AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "M" Move
+              "M" Raise
+              "C" Raise
+              "D" Replace
Mouse 1         T       A       Function "Move-or-Raise"

I am attempting to keep some icons from appearing in the iconbox (namely:
asclock, xload, & xconsole) I have put NoIcon in their Style lines, but
they keep showing up and I can't get rid of them. Anyone have an idea as
to how to eliminate this?

Hello,

I just changed my windowmanager from mwm to fvwm2 because of some
intersting fvwm-features. Generally I am quite happy with fvwm, but I 
miss some things from mwm:

With mwm I could give any X-Client special decor with *clientDecoration
(like in fvwm too) and special window-manager-functionallity with
*clientFunctions (not found in Fvwm). There are some clients I would
prefer to give them no window-manager-functionality at all...

In the Button Bindings, you have several decoration contextes: RWTS...
Why is S for the Resize-Handlers on the window-edges AND for the
window-border which is produced with Style*NoHandlers ?? This leads to
strange functionality, I can resize windows without resizehandlers...
Maybe it would be easier if F stands for the corners and the edges of a
resize-handler windowborder... (like in mwm, resizeh <-> border)

Are there solutions for those problems?

Greetings...

Actually, this is backwards. Specifying NoIcon tells it to go into
IconBox. You must specify an Icon if you don't want it included.

I found another use for it that I have been wanting for quite a while: 
A way to perform a "vertical maximize" function without having the
window appear at (0,0) on the desktop (where I have a button bar):

	AddToFunc	"MaximizeVert"
	+	"I"	Maximize 0 92
	+	"I"	Replace

(92% was empirically derived to allow for the presense of a button bar
on the top, tkgoodstuff's task bar on the bottom, plus some extra room
-- Your Milage May Vary).

Actually, I've seen requests for this functionality come through this
mailing list a few times, so it might even be a candidate for a FAQ if
Chuck decides to implement "Replace" in his forthcoming 2.0.44 release. 
[Nudge, nudge, wink, wink!]

[If anybody is interested, the patch also works in fvwm95 as well with
minor tweaks to two header files.  If you are REALLY interested in the
tweaks, let me know privately, but don't spam this mailing list with
fvwm95 requests.]

Perhaps you can give me an example as to what you mean, because I have now
tried Style Icon and Style Icon iconfile.xpm and the icon still appears.

Not sure you got good information earlier.  This is how I specified the
things I didn't want to appear in the iconbox:

*FvwmIconBox            "*clock*" -
*FvwmIconBox            "*XSysStats*" -

Thankyou for your help. As stated in the last line of my .fvwm2rc file:
# Mostly, you don't have to specify icon files, as FvwmIconBox now
# reads icon files specified in Style commands.

This led me to believe that as long as I didn't specify an Icon in the
Style line of the app, the icon wouldn't appear. To get icons not to
appear in the icon box, you must specify lines in the FvwmIconBox
configuration:
*FvwmIconBox            "xload"         -
works nicely for me.

Just to add to the general noise level (and perhaps induce some
knowlegeable one to look into the code to reconcile the conflicting
reports?)...  It disturbs me to see information going out that runs
counter to what I observe, if for no other reason than that fvwm should do
the same thing on different platforms, and real discrepancies should be
tracked down and corrected.  I get the man-advertised behavior for
FvwmIconBox (manpage dated Jun 24 1994, FvwmIconBox(0.64)): 

Indeterminate icon style, or "Style Icon" gives me *no* FvwmIconBox entry 
for a window.

Specifically calling out the NoIcon style results in an FvwmIconBox entry 
for a window.

Defining "-" as the xpm name for xterm (put into the .fvwm2rc file, of
course, so FvwmIconBox would pick it up on instantiation) resulted in no
icon display for xterms in the FvwmIconBox, regardless of "Style Icon" or
"Style NoIcon". 

I temporarily deleted all of my global Style options to avoid as far as I
could any inadvertent FvwmIconBox Style dependencies.  With no deliberate
icon'ish Style options, I invoked xterm and xload windows and got no entry
in my newly created FvwmIconBox.  Using FvwmTalk, I added "Style XLoad
NoIcon", and then new xload windows were reflected in FvwmIconBox entries. 
Similarly for XTerm.  "Style XLoad Icon" or "Style XTerm Icon" caused new
instances to be ignored by FvwmIconBox.  Why others have different
behavior is an interesting mystery. 

I am not using any clever tricks with FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp.

Well, its a  little confusing, but I  believe its all explained in the
man pages.  The  orignal answer to this  question was sort of correct,
but I don't think it directly addressed the users particular problem.

In a large nutshell:

You can name the icons FvwmIconBox will use 2 ways:

Style "xterm" icon xterm.xpm
*FvwmIconBox "xterm" xterm.xpm

When  you use the first way, to get icons into the "FvwmIconBox"
instead of the "Style "*" IconBox -150 250 -1 -1" type iconbox,
you need to do something like:

Style "*" NoIcon

In fact, I don't normally use the FvwmIconBox, but to fool around with
it, I like:

AddToFunc ConfigIconBox "I" module FvwmIconBox
+                       "I" Style     "*"  NoIcon
+                       "I" Recapture

You can  do individual 'Style "x"  NoIcon's, but think the person with
the problem originally went the other way.   Once you force everything
into the  FvwmIconBox, you want to  use FvwmIconBox's special notation
for "don't put this particular thing into the box", the dash "-".

This is in the man page:

*FvwmIconBox windowname bitmap-file
 ...
 If  bitmap-file  is  specified to   be "-", the    icon  for a
 window corresponding to windowname is not shown in the iconbox.

Hope this clears up any confusion.

Question - is it possible to or would it be a simple modification to allow
'transparent' button bars? 

Why? Well, something like a row of circular xpm's would _look_ very nice, 
but the effect is somewhat spoiled by the block of solid colour behind it.

(Yes, based a little on the bar I saw on the 'Enlightenment' page...but
I don't use Linux, have a slow machine and just plain don't fancy the
rest of the WM!)

Hi -

I recently downloaded and compiled FVWM2 for Linux without any problems.
However, I haven't been able to install it under Solaris 2.5.  After
changing Fvwm.tmpl to reflect my environment I got it to compile but it
was giving a warning about "language F not recognized".  I ignored these
warnings since the program seemed to compile anyway.  However, when I
tried "make install" I got lots of "Error code 2" messages.  Does anyone
know what I should do to get it to install correctly?  Any help would be
much appreciated.

Thanks,

Mmm, I'd no trouble installing it under Solaris 2.5 (despite the -xF option).

Care to post the full text of the error? And if it is only the
'make install' why not just hand copy the files? They're compiled
after all.

Hi again.

Does "minimizing" mean iconifying?

I think we would need to see how you are starting it.

In my opinion, "contool" is the best console program around.

I suppose this has nothing to do with fvwm -- any window manager should
"minimize" an application that was started with the "-iconic" switch.

Just start xconsole without the "-iconic".

How do I tell FvwmWinList to not display certain windows on the list?
I specified *FvwmWinListUseSkipList in my .fvwm2rc config.  But
according to the man page, I need to also specify a WindowListSkip
line.  However, I've no clue what the syntax for this line is.

Thanks,

Thankyou for your opinion... but I am not starting xconsole with -iconic
If someone actually knows why fvwm would be doing this and how to correct
it, please notify me. Thanks

Do you have something like:

  Style "xconsole" StartIconic

in your .fvwm2rc file, by any chance?

Enhanced, less bug ridden, smaller & faster version.

Many thanX to jha@cs.purdue.edu ("John H. Aughey") for testing & suggestions.

The file libs/MatchToken.c (is part of the new library)
must be linked in. 

Please report any bugs/deficiencies to me.

here the man page:


NAME
     FvwmAuto - the FVWM auto-raise module

SYNOPSIS
     FvwmAuto is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invocation
     will work.  The correct syntax is:

          Module FvwmAuto Timeout [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

          AddToMenu Modules "Modules"      Title
          +                 "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
          +                 "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 300 raise lower
          +                 "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
          +                 "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
          +                 "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
          +                 "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

     The Timeout argument is required. It  specifies  how  long a
     window  must retain the keyboard input focus before the com-
     mand is executed. The delay is measured in milliseconds, and
     any integer 0 or greater is acceptable.

     EnterCommand and LeaveCommand are optional.  EnterCommand is
     executed  Timeout  milliseconds after a window gets the input
     focus, LeaveCommand is executed  Timeout  milliseconds  after
     the window has lost focus.

     "Raise" is the default for EnterCommand, but any fvwm2 func-
     tion is allowed. I would not use "Close" or "Destroy" with a
     low timeout, though.  The LeaveCommand can be  handy  for  a
     tidy desktop. Experiment with:

          Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Lower
          Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Iconify


AUTHOR
     FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
     FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.

have fun, 
albrecht

Enhanced, less bug ridden, smaller & faster version.

Many thanX to jha@cs.purdue.edu ("John H. Aughey") for testing & suggestions.

The file libs/MatchToken.c (is part of the new library)
must be linked in. 

Please report any bugs/deficiencies to me.

here the man page:


NAME
     FvwmAuto - the FVWM auto-raise module

SYNOPSIS
     FvwmAuto is spawned by fvwm, so no command  line  invocation
     will work.  The correct syntax is:

          Module FvwmAuto Timeout [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

          AddToMenu Modules "Modules"      Title
          +                 "Audio"        Module FvwmAudio
          +                 "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 300 raise lower
          +                 "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
          +                 "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
          +                 "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
          +                 "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

     The Timeout argument is required. It  specifies  how  long a
     window  must retain the keyboard input focus before the com-
     mand is executed. The delay is measured in milliseconds, and
     any integer 0 or greater is acceptable.

     EnterCommand and LeaveCommand are optional.  EnterCommand is
     executed  Timeout  milliseconds after a window gets the input
     focus, LeaveCommand is executed  Timeout  milliseconds  after
     the window has lost focus.

     "Raise" is the default for EnterCommand, but any fvwm2 func-
     tion is allowed. I would not use "Close" or "Destroy" with a
     low timeout, though.  The LeaveCommand can be  handy  for  a
     tidy desktop. Experiment with:

          Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Lower
          Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop Iconify


AUTHOR
     FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
     FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.

have fun,

	Hello,

using a commercial CFD software, we get flickering windows when using 
fvwm2 on Linux and Solaris 2.5 machines. I don't know if this is a problem
of the window manager or the application or maybe both, and I therefore send
you a copy of the conversation between me and Chris Morley of Fluent Inc.,
who found a workaround (in his code, and I haven't tested it yet!) but he 
guesses that there's a bug in fvwm2.

Any suggestions?

I wrote:

	Hello,

using UNS4.0 with the public-domain window manager fvwm2.0.42, compiled
for Solaris 2.5 and (e.g.) S.U.S.E.-Linux 4.2 (kernel version 1.99.4) 
over X-Windows (X11R5/6) windows partly (1/2, 3/4) flicker with a few Hz, 
making it impossible to work with it. 
The problem does not occur when using the older fvwm1.24r. 
Have you heard of this problem and do you have a solution for it(please don't
tell me to use the older WM)?

I answered C.M.:

	We are running UNS on Sparcstations 4, 20 and a Ultra 2, 
	all running under Solaris 2.5.
	The problem arises when either displaying on the machine
	itself or, using X-Windows over the net, displaying on
	another Sun or a Linux PC, but ALL machines using fvwm2,
	the now default window manager for Linux. The flickering
	does never occur using Fluent 4.3, it does occur using UNS 4.0.

	All I need to do is:
		uns 2d &
		DEFINE-MODELS-VISCOUS
	and switch on any turbulent option. the flickering then
	does not stop, switching back to laminar.

	Dear Chris,

a) I sent our conversation regarding window flickering to the 
   fvwm mailing list and you should have received a CC.

b) sorry, I was too slow, because I didn't try before this morning
   (I just received the tapes for UNS 4.1.4) to get your below mentioned 
   patch from ftp.fluent.com and it looks like it's removed now. 
   Could you once again put it on your ftp-server?

I would like to set up FvwmPager to only display the active desktop,
not all the possible desktops. I would use another method of switching
between desktops (probably tied to a button).

Is This possible?

Hi...tried compiling fvwm2.0.43.

Keep getting:

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../../libs/libfvwm2.a', needed by
'FvwmScroll'.  Stop.

for all the binaries and modules while running "make" and "make
install".

I did RTFM.  Tried various edits of Fvwm.tmpl.  Still no go.

Help!

Start the pager up iconic ... It will become an "active" icon of the
current desktop.   When up de-iconify it you will be able to use all of the
desktops.   Add the line "*FvwmPagerStartIconic" to your .fvwm2rc.

Don't know if this will be of interest, but I recently took another
look at my Python module for writing Fvwm modules.  I've integrated it
with the Tk mainloop so you can now write GUI modules using Python's
Tkinter.py module.  It works pretty well.

My main motivation for attack this again was to implement something
akin to Ctwm's desktop manager window; essentially a radiobutton box
with one button for each desktop, with a symbolic name for the
desktop.  This turned out to be really easy to implement -- probably
about 20 lines of Python code -- but I figured no one would buy it if
it didn't re-implement the FvwmPager too. :-)  Anyway I started
working on that and added a couple of neat features.  I'm pretty close
to finishing it up, but it's not *quite* ready for prime time.  If I
get a chance I'll finish it up and post a message here this weekend.

The small desktop viewer (what I call the "Button View") might do what
you want.  In any case, Python/Tk makes for an excellent
infrastructure for writing Fvwm modules!  There are a couple of
problems with the Fvwm API; most can be worked around, but there is
one bad problem.  I'll describe that more when I post my next message,
later this weekend (hopefully).

Yes, run it, then Iconify it.

Add this to your .fvwm2rc file:

*FvwmPagerStartIconic

This tells the pager to start "iconified" which indicates that you only
want to see the current desktop.  (It's in the man page!)

For the second part of your question, you can add some buttons to
FvwmButtons as follows:

*FvwmButtons(Title "Desk 1". Icon mini-x.xpm, Action 'Desk 0 1')
*FvwmButtons(Title "Desk 2". Icon mini-x.xpm, Action 'Desk 0 2')
*FvwmButtons(Title "Desk 3". Icon mini-x.xpm, Action 'Desk 0 3')

(This tells FvwmButtons to create three buttons that switch to the
specified desktop -- you can use whatever Title or Icon you want.)

Interestingly, if you do this, FvwmButtons should make the button
representing the current desktop "pressed in" and the other ones
"pressed out" -- and it will change each time you switch desktops (using
FvwmButtons or not).

NOTE:  This last paragraph is based on memory; I believe the FvwmButtons
STILL exhibits this behavior, but I haven't used buttons to switch
desktops in quite a while.

\Does this suit your needs?

B> Is This possible?

my pager does this all the time:

*FvwmButtons(4x2, Swallow FvwmPager "FvwmPager 0 0")
########################### Pager #########################################
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1500-1500
# to be swallowed

*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048
*FvwmPagerHilight #cab3ca

*FvwmPagerFont none
# -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8

#*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Emacs
#*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Misc
#*FvwmPagerLabel 2 Make
#*FvwmPagerLabel 3 Spare

i.e: no labels, no font.

I get a 4x2 set of pages representing the current desk.
If i accidently start an application on desk2 (I usually just use desk 1),
it's nearly unreachable (except from winlist)

hope this helps,

hi,

i'm switching from tvtwm to fvwm (version
2.0.43).  i'm looking for an equivalent
function of tvtwm's f.warpto in fvwm.

this is how it works in tvtwm.  you put
this line in .tvtwmrc:

"Insert" =      : all           : f.warpto      "mailtool"


when you hit the Insert key, the "mailtool"
window, if iconified, will be de-iconified
and popped up in your current view.

is there such a function in fvwm?  thanks.

Sure:

# Define a function:
AddToFunc Warp "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
+	       "I" Next [$0] WarpToWindow 24p 24p

Hi, Mike  --

	Well, that certainly is unattractive, isn't it? But it *is* big.

	Seriously, I haven't seen any replies on the mailing list; have you
gotten any private e-mail responses about this problem?

	I spent a couple of late evenings trying to track the problem down,
without much luck so far. I'm not familiar with what tksteal is doing
internally - which extension does this belong to, and what version of Tk 
is your special wish based on? You'd think some other Tk apps would be
stumbling across this, wouldn't you?

	I couldn't find any workarounds. Of course, since the orphaned frame
still responds to window controls, you can get rid of it by closing it, but
that's hardly what you want to tell users they have to do.

	With a little hack tracing (looking specifically for a window carrying
the title "Tgdb debugee"), I'm able to catch the UnmapNotify event that fvwm
should be honoring (and isn't) , but I can't yet tell what distinguishes this
particular window/event from a variety of others that fvwm wants to ignore, and
I never see a ReparentNotify coming through. There are significant v1->v2
changes in this area; I'm not familiar with their history, so puzzling
this out is slow going. Can any fvwm old-timers out there shed any light on
this area?

	If you've gotten any further info on this, or a fix, please let me
know. Otherwise, I'll continue looking into it as time permits.

	Cheers,
	Bob Woodside

Hi everyone, 

A few days ago I upgraded to 2.0.43 (from fvwm) hoping that it would solve
something I really miss in fvwm: Icons that change their name. In concreto:
I am running Fvwm2 and xconsole on my NetBSD-1.2 Sparc ELC. I like to be
able to see at a glance whether there are any new messages in my iconified
xconsole, and it changes it's icon-name to "xconsole *" just for that
purpose.  However, I do not see that happen on my screen unless I move
my mouse pointer over the icon, giving it focus.

I have, however, found a way to achieve my goal: When I start up X I
do a su with failed password, causing xconsole to change it's icon-
name. Then I give it focus to make the change visible. Next, I start the
Talk-module, and give a "recapture". Double click on the console and
iconify it again... the icon is now bigger, with xconsole neatly centered
in it.. and when something happens on my xconsole, the "xconsole *"
icon-name neatly fills it up.

My guess is that the reason the changes in icon-name  aren't
visible is that the icon doesn't get bigger when it happens, the trailing
"*" staying obscured therefore.

So: fvwm seems to support icon resizing (on focus) and also centering of
the icon name (as soon as it changes). But, when you don't give the icon
focus, and your icon-name gets longer, you lose. 

How much trouble would it be to make fvwm2 behave a bit more sane in this
regard? I think this would be nice functionality to have, especially without
the magic incantation I found for it.

Regards, Paul Boven.

Hi,

been checking out the TODO and FAG lists, but couldn't
find anything I like to have as placement styles:

Is it possible to have a Cascading Placement style to be added?
This would mean to place the next window along either
the topleft to bottom-right diagonal or along the top-right to
bottom-left diagonal, so actually causing a CascadingLeftPlacement
and a CascadingRightPlacementStyle (or other conventional names) to be added.

Perhaps also all other windows are moved up so that an equi-distant
distribution is maintained?

I'd like to hear what you think  of it. Is it hard to add such a placement
style myself?

Best regards,
Marcel.

If you look at the RandomPlacement code in placement.c, it looks like this
is what it is trying to do, but I don't think it works as expected.

It shouldn't be.  Just use the existing RandomPlacement code and make it
do what you suggest.  It might not be necesary to add an additional
placement style for this because it seems like this is acceptable behavior
for RandomPlacement.  But maybe some people like the current
RandomPlacement behavior?

I'm still confused. Now we have *FvwmWinListUseSkipList and 
Style Fvwm* WindowListSkip.

Where is the list of windows to skip ?

Hi, Paul --

	Actually, fvwm's policy is quite rational, and not uncommon among
window managers (mwm does this, too). The policy is to size the title to match
the width of the icon pixmap, except for the icon that has focus. Many apps,
like word processors and text editors, like to insert the name of the document
being edited into the title, and if all titles are shown full width, you get
a desktop cluttered with icons that look something like this.

                                  ----------
                                 |          |
                                 | icon.xpm |
                                 |          |
              ---------------------------------------------------
              | ./my/really/long/directory/path/and/filename.txt |
              ---------------------------------------------------

This very quickly gets ugly and hard to read.

	When you shift focus to an icon, the window manager assumes that you
might be expressing an interest in it, so it shows you the full width title.

	The problem with xconsole is that it doesn't provide an icon pixmap
resource, so you get nothing but the little title icon window. However,
this is easy to get around.

	Can you live with having a small, unobtrusive icon pixmap associated
with xconsole? If so, here's what you do.

	1) Find a pixmap that suits you. This may take a little trial and
           error, depending on the effect you want. Most pixmaps are easily
           wide enough to accommodate the string "xconsole *" (except for
           those itty-bitty ones designed for button bars.) If you want one
           that's really minimal, you may have to create your own. I just
           tried a little one sized at 56 x 26 that nicely fits xconsole;
           but YMMV, depending on your font selection.

	2) Change your fvwm2rc Style definition for xconsole as follows:
                Style "xconsole"    Icon My-Favorite-Xconsole.xpm
           (plus whatever other Style arguments you like for xconsole).

	Restart fvwm, and you're in business. You'll now see the title change
to "xconsole *" as soon as new output appears in the buffer.

	Alternatively, you could add an icon to the generic style
specification (the one that says Style "*"), so that all apps that aren't
otherwise associated with an icon resource would use that.

	Good luck,
	Bob

i'm new to this list, and i was wondering about the following:

are there going to be any new conventions for window placement in version 2.0?
such as a cascade windows, or maybe tile windows? i think that would be
useful for maximizing desk space...
also it might be cool if you had some sort of resistance of moving one
window over another, kind of like edge resistance works for moving
windows accross virtual desktops.

would anyone else like to see some things along these lines implemented?

It's in the Style lines.  If you want Fvwm to skip your xterm and
xpostit windows, you put two Style lines in .fvwmrc:

	Style "xterm" WindowListSkip
	Style "xpostit" WindowListSkip

See?

One question concerning the fvwm95 taskbar (hope this is the correct place
to ask!),  can fvwm be configured such that the `maximize' button *not*
extend the window below the taskbar?

When i maximize emacs I can't see it's minibuffer because it gets hidden
behind the taskbar.

BTW, I prefered the older `fvwm' maximize buttom which would maximize 
vertically only;  you'd need to double-click to maximize in both axes.

Also BTW, the mini sun icon next to `Start' should be replaced by 
a fvwm logo (or the little penguin for us Linux users).

Thanks for any help!

Find the place in .fvwm2rc95 (or whatever it's called) where it calls
the Maximize function when the button is hit.  It should be a line
like this:

    Mouse 0 2 A Maximize 100 100

(The `0', `2' and `A' may be different.)  You can just put a different
percentage there.  The first 100 means take 100% of screen width, the
second means take 100% of screen height.  So `Maximize 0 90' means
don't make it wider at all and take 90% of screen height.

YMMV though, since I've never seen a .fvwm2rc95 (or so) file.

Well, I tried, and I find I really really can't ;) 

I made an empty 64x1 bitmap-file and made that my icon, but it looks rather
ugly, as fvwm draws a black line around it. It does do the trick for me, 
but it looks bad. Prefer my old style of getting this to work, given that
I don't reboot my machine that often. Then again, that way I risk forgetting
about it and not realising, like, someone managed to su while I wasn't looking.

So I guess I'll have to either patch xconsole or fvwm2 in some way to behave
special for this problem. Yuck :) Any hints?

	[ ..... ]

Have you tried a shaped icon (an xpm pixmap, not a bitmap).  Then you
can have an icon that has a size, but which really isn't there
(i.e. it is all transparent).  I guess fvwm won't put a black line
around it.  I haven't tried it, so I don't know how fvwm will react to
a completely empty icon though.   Note that you must have compiled fvwm
with the xpm library.

Yep, it's quite unattractive... ;) The reason why the (original) window is
very big (10000x10000) is that the Tk toplevel window can't tell the "stolen"
Xterm window to grow if it is resized by the user. Anyway, the Xterm window
should not be visible at all after being reparentized.

No, but I contacted Charles Hines and he told me he would download tgdb and
see what's wrong with fvwm2 (no further replies since then, though).

Well, it will affect all applications based on TkSteal (and generally every
application which tries to reparentize other windows in a similar way
as TkSteal), but it seems this extension is rarely used in Tcl-land, and
folks who use it probably still use fvwm1, mwm or any other window manager
which doesn't show this bug.

I'm happy to hear you could reproduce the bug even with the old version
of tgdb (so I'm sure now it has nothing to do with my local setup). The
new version is based on Tcl 7.6, Tk 4.2 (the old one was based on 7.3/3.6)
and TkSteal4.0 (all available from ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl), but it
shows exactly the same behaviour regarding the debugee and shell windows.
What TkSteal basically does is:

  - create a frame widget and another frame or label widget inside it
  - as soon as the frame/label widget is mapped, the command "xaccess"
    is called with the parameters:
    "eventreparent -parentwidget frameOrlabel -windowid XidOfOtherWindow",
    which executes the code below (excerpt from tkXAccess.c::969); "window"
    contains the XidOfOtherWindow (i.e. the XID of the Xterm) mentioned above:

  doreparent:
    if (window != (Window) None) {
      /* We found the window to reparent... now reparent it */
      XSync(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), False);
      XWithdrawWindow(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), window,
                      Tk_ScreenNumber(tkrootwin));
      for (counter1 = 0; counter1 < REPARENT_LOOPS; counter1++) {
        XReparentWindow(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), window, parent, 0, 0);
        XSync(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), False);
      }
      XMapWindow(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), window);
      if (!continueXAccess) {
        XSync(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), False);
        sprintf(error_buf, "event window reparent %ld to %ld", window, parent);
        goto Xerror;
      }
      Tcl_ResetResult(interp);
      sprintf(buf, "%ld", window);
      Tcl_AppendResult(interp, buf, (char *) NULL);
    }
    XSync(Tk_Display(tkrootwin), False);

Closing the reparentized Xterm window (or iconifying it, for that matter)
will make it disappear, but it will also make it inaccessible from the
Tk toplevel window, so this is actually not a good idea.

I'm also interested in being informed as soon as someone has a fix for
this behaviour. I'm not an X or fvwm expert, but please let me know if
you need more information I could provide, or if you have some code which
I could try out.


Thanks for your help,

I would beg to differ with your opinion.  Anyone who uses TkDesk or
tkgoodstuff also
uses TkSteal.  These are fairly popular programs used with fvwm 2.43.  I
use it all of 
the time (but only with tcl 7.5/tk 4.1 since the version of TkSteal that I
have will not
compile with the new tcl/tk release).  I have never had any problems with
TkSteal, but
I have never tried to swallow an xterm before.

The line:

*FvwmWinListUseSkipList

simply tells the winlist module to use the list.

>From the man page:

     *FvwmWinListUseSkipList
          Tells FvwmWinList to not  show  the  windows  that  are
          listed  on  a  WindowListSkip line if the configuration
          file.

What may be contributing  to the confusion is the  wording on  the man
page, it is refering to the 1.x .fvwmrc-type config file.

(Chuck, note the  reference  to the 1.x  config  file, and the  faulty
grammer.)

The actual list is created thru the style lines:

Style "Fvwm*" WindowListSkip
Style "etc"   WindowListSkip

Yep, just get a copy of an older Tcl release (7.5 and 7.6b1 are okay) and
add the function Tcl_CreatePipeline (from unix/tclUnixPipe.c) to BLT's
sources. Works fine for me.

I haven't used TkDesk or tkgoodstuff yet, but I doubt they use TkSteal to
incorporate the toplevel windows of external applications. If they did,
they'd be bitten by the reparent bug, just as "tkemacs" (a demo app
which comes with TkSteal and which runs Emacs in a Tk toplevel window).


Cheers,

I'm running fvwm 1.2 with no problems until...

We've recently gotten in some Sparc20's running with Ross's
150 MHz processor.  When we fire up fvwm on these machines,
the console spits out
   dbri_xmitqcmd: out of DVMA space!
and the speaker squeals continuously.

I've tracked the problem down to xmailbox++.  As soon as it
tries to output audio, the message appears and the squealing
starts.

This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the OS, as other
Sparc 20's (without the fast Ross cpu) are also running SunOs4.1.4.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks

Will Ezell

I came up with this:

AddToFunc "Maximize-func" "C" Maximize 0 100
+                         "D" Maximize 100 100

#Mouse 0                4       A       Maximize 0 100
# PSG's function is like old fvwm:
Mouse 0         4       A       Function "Maximize-func"

Yup, that did the trick! No lines around it, just the text-icon. Only funny
thing is that the word xconsole has a bit more room in it's icon than any
of the other icon, but I guess I'll.. have to live with that ;)

Subject: FVWM: X-terminal question
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

Hi,

To display messages from fvwm on a workstation, I used to use
xconsole. I believe that fvwm2 has a module, FvwmConsole, which gets
started by default, that performs a similar function.

I am now using fvwm2 to manage an X-terminal screen, but of course,
/dev/console is not readable by me, and even if it were, it would have
everybody else's messages too.

How can I achieve a similar effect?

Currently my .xsession (which is run by xdm) logs *some* of the messages
to a file, but others such as 
fbconsole: open /dev/console: Permission denied
go to /var/tmp/xdm-errors.

My question is really threefold:
1. Why do the messages go to different places, ie. why are the
	fbconsole (presumably fbconsole == FvwmConsole?) messages immune
	to my redirect?
2. How do I get all of the messages to go to the same place, and
3. How do I display them in a window on my X-terminal?

If anyone could answer any or all of these questions, it would be most
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Tim.

Errors may be printed on stdout or stderr.
Try this line in .xsession if you use sh or ksh

    exec > $HOME/xsession.log 2>&1

If you want to track the messages, try something like

    xterm -e tail -f xsession.log

FvwmConsole does not perform a similar function:

The FvwmConsole allows the user to type  fvwm commands into xterm, and
have them executed immediately.  These commands are usually specfified
in the .fvwmrc file, or are bound to  menu/mouse items as specified in
that  file.   This tools  is  particularly  useful   for  testing  new
configuration  ideas, or for implementing   temporary changes to  your
environment.

(Chuck, please note the reference  to .fvwmrc which should be .fvwm2rc
or at least .fvwm[2]rc.)

You need  to   run something  as  your  console.  You  can   still use
xconsole, or you  can use one of  the many substitutes including xterm
with the -C flag.

In  general any output that  can't  be directed  to  a tty  will go to
/dev/console.  You can also get output there thru redirection.  Eg.

  echo "hello" > /dev/console

Exactly what I am using, except for the filename.

Thanks, that answers 3.

I can now answer 1 & 2 myself -- the messages don't go to different places,
and fbconsole is actually part of openwindows (brokenwindows) .. I was
actually looking at someone else's unredirected output in 
/var/tmp/xdm-errors -- sorry.

Are there any options for FvwmConsole to make it achieve similar to
`xterm -e tail -f xsession.log`, ie. tell it to get its input from a
file, or even a pipe ?

Thanks,

Tim.

Oops, sorry, missed the part about you using an x-terminal.

The information about FvwmConsole is still true, but forget the part
about xconsole, etc.

You can redirect outputs when you start fvwm2, something like:

	fvwm2 2>$HOME/fvwm2.errors 1>$HOME/fvwm2.outputs

I experimented a little bit. Others may have better solution, but at 
least it works for me.

Assuming you have a xterm open before starting fvwm2,

Add the following in init function in .fvwm2rc. This will start
FvwmConsole of fvwm side only, not its front end.

	+  "I" Module FvmwConsole -e /bin/sh -c 'sleep 20'

Then, start fvwm without redirection, fvwm2 should reports any errors to
this xterm
	
	fvwm2 &

You have 20 seconds to start FvwmConsole front end.

	/usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmConsoleC.pl

This should do it. All error messages will show up on the xterm.

I didn't know xterm with -C option doesn't work through xdm. If it does,
things are much easier. "FvwmConsole -C" would do.....

Hi:

I'm new to the list. But I checked the archives web page and didn't see 
anything about this....

If you haven't seen afterstep, it's based upon the look and feel of 
Next's window manager.  Some things are cool, some things are simply 
novel.  But the one cool thing that I really liked was a module called 
Wharf.  What wharf is is a button bar that will collapse upon itself and 
also open up "folders" of other buttons you can press.

Well, I got this incorporated into both fvwm2.0.43 beta as well as
fvwm1.24r.  It wasn't too togh either.  You can cut and paste some code 
from the goodstuff module fro the event loop handler. Other than that 
it's pretty clear sailing.

I did this at work, (which is not connected to the net) so I can't tell 
you how much was different from what afterstep had. But I can say it was 
pretty easy to incorporate. So for those adventerous souls who don't want 
to give up all the hard work it took to get your fvwm session "just 
right" then I can attest that getting afterstep's whar incorporated is 
almost a piece of cake!

I use it with 1.24r, my bud at work uses it with fvwm2. No problems 
either way.

D> xconsole, or you  can use one of  the many substitutes including xterm

which are ?

I use:

	*FvwmButtons(10x2, Swallow (UseOld, NoClose, Respawn) "Console" 
		"Exec console -display $HOSTDISPLAY -geometry 70x5-1500-1500")
	
with console being:
	#!/usr/local/lbin/tcsh
	exec xterm -name Console -C ${argv[1-]} &

on my main machine, and
	#!/usr/local/lbin/tcsh
	exec rsh vta_host -n "exec xterm -name Console ${argv[1-]} 
						</dev/null >&/dev/null &"
on any remote machine since I can't access /dev/console from there.

So I have a small window to both 
	show me console messages, if I'm on my main machine
	enter commands (i.e: start netscape & others as I see fit)

I'd like to extend this to:
	show me fvwm2 messages
	enter fvwm2 commands

The latter can be accomplished with FvwmPipe and echoing to that pipe.
The former is the problem.

How do I get xterm to show me not only the messages to the console, but
also messages which are echoed to another pipe/file ???

I could redirect the fvwm2 output to the console, but that's not
acceptable, if somebody else is using that machine (& the console).
I'd find it rather rude if sombody wrote his errors to my console.
(and permissions woiuldn't allow that anyway)


Any suggestions?

Can I redirect /dev/Console to another pipe (say ~/.messages) and also pipe
fvwm2 output there?

Can I get xterm (or any substitute - which ? -) to read special messages
from an arbitrary pipe? 

HELP !!! (been trying this for some time now, but never found a way)
albrecht

(the solution for this problem would eliminate any use of FvwmConsole and
save much screen space)

but when I try to start it from fvwm2, it dies almost immediately,
with a message something like

	FvwmConsoleC error in connect

(in fact I get exactly this message when I try to run
FvwmConsoleC from a shell by hand).

I have readline, which I assume it is seeing, but anyway the
problem seems to be different: do you know how I can build under
solaris?

Also I heard there is a new version of FvwmConsole, can you tell
me where I can get it from?

Thanks, Jens

ps I have it it working fine under Sunos4 and X11R6.

Hi,

I found a problem with FvwmIconBox which is very simple to reproduce.
Unfortunateley I am no X-Wiz, so I can't fix it.

I like to have just the names of the programms in my IconBox. I hav
therefore set:

*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 69x0

Opticly this works without problem. But whenever I start a programm which
supplies its own icon, eg: Netscape, XFig ...  the
following message apears on the console:


Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for
operation) 
Major opcode of failed request:  53 
Resource id of failed request:  0x0 
Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
Major opcode of failed request:  55 
Resource id of failed request:  0x3800041 
Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
Major opcode of failed request:  62 
Resource id of failed request:  0x3800041 


can anybody help ?

cheers
tobi

Hi,

Excuse me if this has been brought up before or is already solved:
What I would like to see in FVWM (I'm running 2.0.43) would be
that it remembers which windows was active on a certain desktop
and automatically activates this particular window when this 
desktop is switched to. This would save a lot a mouse clicks
I currently need to make.

An example to make it clear if my explanation above is too fuzzy:

1.) I got my pager configured for 3 separate workspaces containing
    4 desktops each.

2.) I'm on desktop #1 in workspace #1 and I got two DECTERM windows open.
    I got another DECTERM in a separate deskop #2 in workspace #1.

3.) When I switch from desktop #1 to desktop #2 (within the same
    workspace) I need to make the window active manually by clicking
    on it.

Note that this works when switching *between* workspaces and not between
desktops so the active window is saved per workspace and not per desktop.

Can this be changed somehow?

Thanks -- Tom

the modules compile and even the fvwm95-2 however when I go to launch the 
app it reports that ld: undefined error strerror

Does anyone know where strerror can be found???

If there's not one ifdeffed into the source, use the one below.
But _all_ ANSI C implementations are required to supply this - what

Hi

I have fvwm2 running on a ultrasparc with solaris 2.5. I cannot get
any keys to repeat when I hold them down. I suspect it has something
to do with the login procedure and their DCE environmet.

Can anyone help?

Is anyone out there? I thought that I had subscribed to this list, but
I don't believe that I have recieved any posts since I go the

Thanks

Key repeat can be turned on and off with xset:

xset r on  # Turn repeat on

I know of at least one application (softwin) that turns key repeat off
each time it gets focus.

You don't say how long you have been  subscribed but there is activity

Hi Steve,

what do you get if you do "xset q"?  Specifically, look for something like:

[194] xset q
Keyboard Control:
  auto repeat:  on    key click percent:  0    LED mask:  00000000
  auto repeating keys:  00faaf8becff67f2
                        ff7bf0ff1ff89f03
                        1100000000000000
                        0000000000000000

Every now and then my FvwmButtons window closes when entering return. Is
there a way to prevent the Buttonbox from getting keyboard-control (it
is
ment to be controlled by a mouse anyway). Maybe this only applies to the
version I use (fvwm95-2, based upon 2.0.41f)?

Hi,

a bunch of people at our cluster are thirsting for a function
that will move the pointer, not relatively, but to an absolute position.
We are trying to abandon all mouse usage, and the lack of such
a function is our main obstacle.

Thanks,
    Huy

I use fvwm 2.0.43 and FvwmAudio won't start. 
Beforehead I had tried version 1 of fvwm and I had the sounds.
Now I can't. I tried with rplay and without rplay 
(cat xx.au >/dev/audio)

It seems I have put the right lines at the end of .fvwm2rc

I noticed that the FvwmAudio Module does not appear in the top
list of process. When I start it again it never occurs in that
list.

Is there something I forgot?

Thanks in advance for your help

Jacques

A new borderstyle patch is available.  Since the borderstyle requires
the title-bar patch, you also get all of the features of the
title-bar patch and then some.

I am not about to describe all of the features since they are covered
in the man page (but I will put a number of examples on the www page
in the future).

The only change from bsp1f is that if you put a titlestyle or
borderstyle state definition as the last few elements on a line, you
do not need to use parentheses.

E.g.:
borderstyle active pixmap sometexture.xpm

is okay as well as

borderstyle active (pixmap sometexture.xpm) inactive (pixmap tex2.xpm)

The same goes for titlestyle (using the bsp2 patch).  This change was
suggested by Don Mahurin.  At this time, you need to apply tbp8 and
the bsp2 to get the latest (near final) functionality.

The patches (tbp8, and bsp2 applied in that order) can be retrieved
at:

just add a generic action like the Action XTerm below (may be nop)


*FvwmButtons (Icon xterm.xpm,	\
	Action XTerm, \
	Action (Mouse 1) 'Xec "Menu Tools" "Popup Machine OnHostExec $0 $1 xterm"', \
	Action (Mouse 2) 'Xec "Menu WindowOps" XLock', \
	Action (Mouse 3) 'Xec  MyWindowList	"X @@"')

so you can see I do 7 different things with a single button:
I think this is a feature, though the nop should be default
-> no more crashing on non-handled events:

enter:		xterm
mouse1-single:	Menu Tools
mouse1-double:	menu of remote hosts, where I may open an xterm on
mouse2-single:	Menu Windowops - if no patch of the root window is left.
mouse2-double:	xlock
mouse3-single:	WindowList
mouse3-double:	door opener

known bug of old FvwmAudio - very buttoned up about errors - just quit.
try the new version on my home page - or better: wait for fvwm2-0.44

X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2


   Hi,
     I currently use FVWM on SUN based UNIX network which supports
Xterm client-server communication. My X-TERM is a NCD with a 20 in
high resolution display. My question involves running FVWM on my PC
when I'm dialed into the network instead of working at my workstation.
When I connect with my PC (Ethernet or Dialup) running WIN95 and
Exodus xterm software, FVWM uses my large NCD physical display
size instead of my actual PC screen size:

  1) Is there a way to instruct FVWM to use a different physical
     screen size (in terms of height/width of pixels) ? So that when
     I'm dialled into my PC the physical desktop will be scaled down
     to my PC screen size.  

  2) Are there versions of FVWM for the WIN95 OS ?


   THANKS !!

Actually, none that I know of. I had a similar problem on my network. I
like to use 1024x768 resolution, but the monitors on my network don't go
past 800x600. Most Xwindows clients do have a configurable option to set
the screen size, but this changes the size of the client window. You can
only change the display size of the X server on the machine through the
Xconfig file.

Until this week, you could ftp the latest version of FvwmIconMan and
my MiniIcons patch to fvwm2.0.43 from mahler.cs.arizona.edu. 

Now, mahler has been decomissioned, and I don't have easy access to an
anonymous ftp server here (I'd have to actually ask somebody to get something
put there!) so I've moved all that to my webpage. You can find the latest
FvwmIconMan and whatever at:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/

It seems to work for me, but if it doesn't work, please send me email and 
i'll fix it.

So everyone knows, you can also upload things to
ftp.hpc.uh.edu:/pub/incoming/fvwm and let me know there's something new
there and I'll move it into the main distribution.  I think perhaps that
I'll set up something to mail me automatically.

Hello everybody,
	Its quiet surprising to see my queries ignored. 

	I have queried about my problem two times so far but :-(

	i am repeating it.

	i am using a SUN 0S 4.1.3 Sparc station. i compiled the fvwm-2.0.42 after
	making som changes ( as i dont have Xpm )  it compiled fine.

		but on running it crashes with a message "undefined _NoResource"

	Can anyone solve my problem. 

	Also i would be glad if i can get a precompiled binary for SUNOS4.1.3.


Please dont disappoint me THIS TIME.

Thanx in advance
madhukar

madhukar,

Maybe I'm out of line here, but it isn't necessarily our job to help
you, and phrasing "your requests" for help in the manner that you have,
only angers those who might be willing to help.  It wouldn't surprise me
one bit if you don't get *ANY* replies that are worthwhile.

First of all, I would like to say that fvwm2 is alpha/beta class code.
it doesn't always work.  Nobody guarantees that it does.  However, sir,
most likely someone has successfully used it on SUNOS4.1.3.

Secondly, you have an out-of-date version.  The latest release 2.0.43
with 2.0.44 coming "any day now".  Given your problem you might want to
try to upgrade to the latest version.  That alone may solve your
problem.

Finally, offer some more information.  Although I have never built fvwm2
on SUNOS, I have built it successfully on AIX, Linux, HP-UX, and OSF/1.
I have never seen an error like you mentioned and can't offer a clue as
to what the problem might be.  Possibly some sort of configuration
files?  Something more?  Maybe someone on this list will recognize your
problem, but I, for one, am at a loss.

In closing, please take the time to be polite and try to explain the
problem to the best of your ability.  Giving us an excessive amount of
information won't hurt and put a lack of it doesn't help.  Neither does
attitude.

-Alan

hey everyone... question here... :)

i'm running the newest beta version of fvwm2 i think... (2.0.42b) and had
a question:

the windows place themselves, but i want to be able to place them with the
pointer... what modification to the system.fvwm2rc file do i need to make?

i played around the the ActivePlacement command, and commented out the
RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement commands, but still doesnt let me do
it... 

admittedly, i'm a relative newbie in the fvwm configuration world (i was
running other people's rc files until now) so any help would be greatly
appreciated... :)

thanx...

Hi all! 
 
   Apart the other nasty little bug (dotted cursor hanging around 
sometime) I have found a little problem with focus/raise (I don't 
know if autoraise related). To be fast and effective: i start a 
terminal via "InitFunction", and this and _only_ this window show 
marked attitude to stay in the foreground: if I open and position 
a window partially overlapped with it, the new window got IMMEDIATLY 
lowered and the first one got focus. This happens only with this 
first window. 

   Data: fvwm 2.0.43 on a Linux RedHat 3.0.3 (kernel 2.0.25 libc 5.2 
Xfree 3.1).

   The starting sequence is:

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 1500
+                        "I" Exec BDROP_COMMAND BDROP &
+                        "I" Exec rxvt -geometry +100+100 &
+                        "I" Exec MYBIN/myxwatch &
+                        "I" Module FvwmButtons      

Any hints? Is the message understandable at all :-)? 
Bye, happy fvwming,

                     Romano

Subject: FVWM: "I've found a bug" (hints)

X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

I'm using fvwm 2.0.43 under DEC OSF 3.2c X11R5.

When using our application, which previously runned under MWM, I've
noticed the following problems :

- Under DEC OSF/1, the PropMotifWmHints structure uses 64 bits
members. Since 32 bits members are defined in the file decorations.c,
the protocol is not understood by FVWM.

Here is an extract of the MwmUtil.h that I have on my system :

typedef struct
{
#ifndef OSF_v1_2_4
    CARD32	flags;
    CARD32	functions;
    CARD32	decorations;
    INT32	inputMode;
    CARD32	status;
#else /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
    /* 32-bit property items are stored as long on the client (whether
     * that means 32 bits or 64).  XChangeProperty handles the conversion
     * to the actual 32-bit quantities sent to the server.
     */
    unsigned long	flags;
    unsigned long	functions;
    unsigned long	decorations;
    long 	        inputMode;
    unsigned long	status;
#endif /* OSF_v1_2_4 */
} PropMotifWmHints;

Updating this definition in decorations.c fix the problem.

- I've a window with MWM Decoration = TITLE and MWM Function = none, it
is still possible to move the window using the title bar. It is not
allowed under MWM. I've found that the move_window (move.c) function
does not use the check_allowed_function2 (decoration.c) to check
MWM_FUNC_MOVE, as it is done for iconify/close etc. Moreover,
check_allowed_function2 does not support the F_MOVE argument.

- Our application has two process, and we want the window of process 1
to be over the window of process 2. When both process are started,
process 2 send message containing its window id, and process 1 use
XSetTransientForHint to make its window transient for the other
window.
Unfortunately, it seems that FVWM doesn't not support that. The
TransientFor property is read for new window only, the property
notify event handler does not check the TransientFor property.


Are these last two bugs really bugs and already known ? Would you like
me to send patchs for that ?

Style "*"           ActivePlacement, DumbPlacement

This is what I use, and it works.

You might also try

Style "*" NoPPosition

Some programs (like netscape) request a certain position on the screen.
This instructs FVWM to ignore that and let you place them.


Speaking of PPosition, doesn't TWM have this kludge where you can tell it
to honor PPostion except when the program requests 0,0?  I found this did
the right thing 99.9% of the time.

I did a couple of greps  thru the source  code for 2.0.42, and I don't
find any  uses  of  the  word "undefined".    Also I  don't   find any
occurrences of the string "_NoResource".

I do find a couple of uses  of the string  "NoResource" but not in the
context of printing a  message.  (It seems  to be used when  something
doesn't have an X resource name.)

Moving to 2.0.43 might be helpful.

I always compile with the xpm package, and I  suspect that most others
do this also, so I would recommend taking the time to do that.

You mention a crash,  if there is a core  file, a stack trace would be
helpful.

If none of  these work, I would attempt  to start fvwm2  under "trace"
and if that didn't help, I would start adding printfs to fvwm2.

I think that sometimes,  there is no answer posted  because no one has
an answer.  There is  no one on this list   that is designated  as the
last resort question answerer.  (I am not suggesting that there should
be.)

I would suggest that if you don't get an answer the first time, try to
get   more information and post  again.   Eventually given enough data
someone will become intrigued and jump in.

Hello,

  I'm running fvwm95-2 and am having a config problem.

1. I would like my 3X2 virtual desktop to be sticky, but my attempts
   to add the "Sticky" param in the .fvwmrc file don't take.

2. I would also like to be able to move the virtual desktop window like
   I would an xterm.

3. Also, as it stands now, I have to move my mouse to one side to pull
   the virtual desktop in view, and once it's in view, any xterm I open
   up is halfway off the screen so I have to move it fully view both.
   It's as if each monitor-full of background screen is too small...
   How do I fix this?

my .fvwmrc file follows:         

thanks,

jamie

Add this style flag to your .fvwm2rc95 file:

Style "Fvwm Pager"   StaysOnTop, Sticky

Same change.  You currently have the style "NoTitle" and "NoHandles"
applying to the FVWM Pager.  The line I gave you above should fix that.

I think the one style line above will prevent you from having to switch
desktops in order to get your pager, making the question moot.

Coment out the `Style "*" NoPPosition' line and you'll be good to go.

And that is not the latest version.

I have that in my .fvwm2rc, and it seems to work for all windows _except_
the GIMP's main window. Somehow, the GIMP always sets it's main window at
about 30,30. Anyone know how to get fvwm to use smartplacement on this
window?

Maybe this was just an oversight on your part but the fvwm95-2 rc file is 
not fvwmrc it is fvwm2rc95.  Putting changes in the fvwmrc file won't 
effect fvwm95.

You have a virtual screen in your xf86config file.  comment out the 
virtual line in the screen section of your server entry in the 
/etc/xf86config fil and the whole desktop will be in view at once.

I see you have the proper file inserted here.  Try moving it to your root 
directory with a dot (.) in front of it to insure it is being read.

Check to see if it has a geometry setting.  If it does delete it.

Do you mean check to see if I'm running "gimp -geometry ..."? No, I'm
not.

Quite true. Jason was very prompt on this if anybody is wanting to release
stuff via ftp. Anything that's not officially part of the fvwm distribution
should be here. the misc directory is really way too sparse given the amount
of stuff that people have released (the various titlebar patches, xpm patches,
the python module). 

Personally, since FvwmIconMan went into the standard fvwm distribution, I've
only been using my ftp site (and now http site) for beta releases that are
newer than the latest fvwm. As such, I would rather keep tight control over
the README so that people know which version of fvwm was current when the beta
was released (since whenever I put a version on my site I usually send a copy
to Chuck, you can assume that when a fvwm release occurs, it always has the
latest version). 

This reminds me. Jason could you please remove FvwmIconMan 0.2 and 0.3 from
the misc directory? Thanks. Also, perhaps you could set up a directory
specifically for patches? If you want one to start with, the miniicon patch
and its README is in: 
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/miniicon_patch/

Patches really shouldn't go directly into the misc directory I think.
Perhaps in a subdirectory of /pub/fvwm/version-2?

Well, my copy of gimp places itself at 10,10.

I traced this to gimp/app/resource.h line 166:

  "Gimp.geometry: +10+10",

I'm not sure what  a PPosition field is,  but  I don't think  the gimp
uses it.

I believe I  achieved the desired  behavior by loading this  xresource
thru xrdb:

Gimp.geometry: 273x175

(273x175 was the  size the gimp was trying  to become, I left  out the
position.)

I've installed X11R6.1, xpm3.4i and fvwm2.0.42 compiles fine but when
I try to run it I get the following response:

	ld.so.1: fvwm2: fatal: libXpm.so.4.9: can't open file: errno=2

What have I missed?

I guess it was a geometry setting.  Eh?

Probably fvwm2 is  looking in the  "standard" places for libXpm.so.4.9
and you didn't install it there.

You have a number of choices,

1) Install libXpm in the standard place.  For example, if you are using
Solaris, put it in /usr/openwin/lib.

2) When you link fvwm2, use the -R flag.  For example if libXpm is in
/u/xpm/lib, link fvwm2 with the flags -L/u/xpm/lib and -R/u/xpm/lib.

3) Start fvwm2 thru  a shell and in  the shell, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
include the library that xpm is in:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/u/xpm/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
exec /u/fvwm/fvwm2

Sounds to me like you do not have xpm installed (at least not correctly)
Look through your lib files and try to find libXpm.so.4.9 Also, I would
suggest compiling the newest version of fvwm (fvwm2.0.43).

BTW: does anyone have an estimate as to when 2.0.44 is scheduled to be
released??

I have seen this before, or something like it.  Try rearranging your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it uses a different ld.so I think.  I don't
know so well the language, but I would be fairly certain that either
the libXpm.so is not in your library path or another library is 
read before the one that fvwm2 was built with

i got to thinking something and was curious...

i think it'd be pretty interesting if there was a .fvwm2rc file generator
that had an X interface, with fields for pretty much all the
configuration options that fvwm2 offers...

something like a control panel that allows easy manipulation of the rc
file... 

i mean... hehe... it'd be relatively easier to configure that way... sure
it takes away all the fun of using brute force in the config file, but
it'd also save time... :)

if something like this already exists, then my idea is pretty much null
and void... :) ... but if not, do you think there is a need for something
like this? ... well.. maybe not need... lets say a "demand" for something
like this?

Actually, I have attempted to send a couple of notes lately that have
touched on this, but my mail has been broke.  My incoming mail got
fixed the other day, but my outgoing was apparently still dead.  I
think it's fixed now... (fingers crossed).

Anyways, I've been ill for about a week and a half, which delayed
2.0.44 even more...  I have lots of stuff going in it, and it's taking
a fair amount of time to merge it all together.  I'm going to try and
get it out by the end of next week, but as always I make no
guarantees.

Hi Romano.

I tried replying to this earlier, before I realized my outgoing mail

If I do understand you correctly, it sounds an awful lot like a bug
that I have noticed but haven't got around to fixing yet.  My version:
I have a small .xinitrc that starts an xterm and xsession, and
xsession starts up my development version of fvwm2.  The xterm is
given the focus, but if I pop up a menu before doing anything else,
the focus shifts to the xsession window when the menu dissappears
(first time only).  Clicking in the xterm (I use click to focus)
before bringing up the menu stops this.

And if I restart, no window has the focus initially, but bringing up
(then down) a menu causes the xsession window to get the focus.

I have a rough idea what the problem might be, and I'll look into it
for 2.0.44.

Sounds good to me.  I don't currently have the time to track down patches,
so if anyone wants to contribute theirs to /pub/incoming/fvwm, just let me

i know that this wouldnt be the right place to ask this question, but
everyone  has been REALLY helpful so far... so if i'm out of line asking
this, then just tell me... and i'll post to the newsgroups...

my question:

vxp (the visual X developing environment) requires libXm.so.2   .. but i
dont have that library on my system... :( ....

is there a central place to grab a couple libraries? or is there a package
i forgot to install? ...

thanx.. :)

There is a minor update of the borderstyle patch (bsp2b).  Please test it out.

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

It should be working well on nearly any platform now.

I take it, that you have a Linux system. If that is not the case, then
most of the following information will probably not apply to you. As
FVWM is cross-platform software, it is hard to guess what platform you
refer to, if you do not specify it:

sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux (and mirror sites) usually carries most
libraries, but in this case, that won't help you much.

libXm.so.2 is the Motif library. Motif is a commercial widget set,
that has to be licensed from the OSF (open software foundation). Some
people are currently working on a free clone (lesstiff), but so far it
is not ready for general use; besides, it only implements the old 1.2
release, but many newer applications require 2.0.

So, there are a couple of alternatives:

 - you ask somebody, who has a copy of these libraries, to build a
   statically linked version of this program. You can then use the
   binary without having to get a copy of libXm. The drawback is, that
   the binary will be rather big (probably between 1MB and 2MB).

 - you buy a run-time license of libXm. This gives you just the
   library, but it does not give you all of the header files. So it
   still requires somebody else to build the program, but this time,
   it can be linked dynamically. Run-time licenses are considerably
   less expensive than full development licenses, but their use is
   limited.

 - I would recommend, that you get a full development license. This
   allows you to build your own programs and you do not require
   somebody else's help whenever you get new source code or want to
   change the program. I have a copy of Infomagic's Moo-Tiff and I am
   quite satisfied with it. It costs $99 which is a good price,
   although somebody reported that he got his libraries (from a
   different vendor) even less expensive. For more information, have a
   look at http://www.infomagic.com or read old news articles with
   http://www.dejanews.com; this thread shows up every so often.

It seems to need the Motif library .... And I think that library is a
commercial one now.

You can go to the OSF/Motif site :

http://www.cen.com/mw3/

There is a list of vendors ...

Now that the furore surrounding modal dialogs has died down I would like to ask 
a few questions and maybe make some suggestions for focus handling.  I really 
like sloppy focus but some applications I use insist on popping up dialogs. 
These applications work better with clicktofocus but turning it on for 
particular apps is not something I want to do.

Questions:
1) If a module requests to be informed of every window creation what information 
gets passed?
2) Is transient_for status available to modules?
3) Is modality status available to modules?
4) If newly created/mapped windows got the focus but sloppyfocus was active 
would that quell the complaints of the modality-is-important brigade?

What I'm thinking of is that maybe a module could be written that moves the 
focus to newly created windows.  I'm pretty sure that it's doable and it would 
make applications that pop up dialogs easier to use.

Just focusing on new windows might be too simple so a further refinement may be 
to only switch focus if the new window is a transient_for the currently focused 
window.  E.g. you have an application performing a task and you move to another 
apps window, if the first app pops up a window the focus would not switch.  This 
would be my option but I don't know if the module protocol would be able to pass 
enough information.

Real modality might be supportable with a module if modality info could be 
passed to modules.  On every focus event a check of the windowlist could be done 
to see if any transient_for windows have modality on, if one does the focus 
could be switched.  This would allow modality in a sloppyfocus environment.

Any comments
Tim Phipps.

Sounds like a good idea. 

A while back I asked about whether others like this idea I had for a general
module that would basically keep an eye on what fvwm does for the purpose of
keeping lots of state about windows (so for exmaple you could keep a stack of
sizes that a window has had so you maximize a window horizonatally, maximize
vertically, and then be able to get back to it's original size). Then Barry
Warsaw (hope I spelled that right) and others pointed out that python is the
way to go here, and I agreed, and then I haven't done anything with it since
(damn grad school). 

But I've been thinking about it since. Basically it would be a module (could
be writting in python or C) and you could send python code to it (or have it
read the code from a startup file) along the lines of: when you see fvwm event
X, run python code Y. Where the fvwm event could be something like NewWindow,
or a command that fvwm sent to the module via SentToModule (which lets you
send an arbitrary string to a module). 

If we had such a module, it would be trivial to do what you want.

I think that I'll get cracking on it now. There already is a python "module"
out there, but it's pretty minimal. I think it's basically a Class that
interfaces python code to fvwm. Does anybody have more information?

I think the next version of my Fvwm.py module could easily support
something like this.  I have a module called Tracker.py to which you
can pass any packet object received from Fvwm (the Python module
transforms each message packet into an object).  The tracker then
sucks out relevent information from these packet objects and maintains
a database of the desktop and window states.

I'm very nearly ready for the next release, but have just been too
busy at work to finish things up.  I really hope to have it ready
RSN.  If you're really anxious to have a look, let me know because I
could probably send you something to peek at, even if it's not
quuuuiiiite ready for a more general release.

I wanted to thank everyone who responded to my cry for help with
autorepeating keys on my Ultrasparc and fvwm. I finally got the keys
repeating by deleting the .xserverrc file from my home directory.

It contained the following line:

/usr/bin/X11/X -ar1 350  -ar2 30

After I removed that file and ran starx, my keys repeated. I don't
really understand why, but I'm happy.

Thanks again

Hello everybody !

I've just installed fvwm2 (2.0.43) and fvwm95 (2.0.42a) on our SUNs 
running Solaris 2.5.
Everything works just fine, _except_:

I tried to add the following command either to a button or to a menu 
entry:
Exec xterm -title Pine -geometry 80x50 -e pine &

When I type this command (without the Exec, of course) at the commanline 
in some shell window, everything works just fine.
When I add the line to a button and/or menu and invoke that action, the 
xterm comes up and starts pine, but any keypress is not recognized before 
another key is pressed or the mouse has been moved out of and back into 
the window again. This happens in both window managers.

As the X server in our system is X11R5 compliant, I suspect this to be the
cause of the problem. Unfortunately, I haven't yet compiled the programs 
on my Linux box at home, so I cannot compare the behaviour.

Any help would be gladly appreciated.

Thanks,
	Ulrich Quill

Sorry for taking so long to answer.  AFAIK, mwm has a property that
generally sez something about whether or not clicks should be passed
on to applications.  I was talking about the *first*, focus-giving,
click only.  All other clicks should be passed on.  Otherwise, I
suppose I could just put some binding for mouse1 in W context in the
config file and everything would be set.

Any ideas?

Yeah:

  1) I'm planning to add this as a global option in in 2.0.44
     (ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick or something like that)
  2) In events.c, in HandleButtonPress look for:
     #if 1 /* pass click event to just clicked to focus window */
     and just change that to an '#if 0' instead.

These notes must have been among those I lost over the weekend or I
would have responed sooner...

Hi,

I am currently trying to configure FVWM2 to my needs and have a few questions.
I have tried interogating everyone on my local newsgroups but they don't
seem to know so I am hoping you can be more helpful.

1. In my buttonbar I have a swallowed xterm which is very useful, but I have
to click on it before I can enter text, whereas my normal xterms focus as soon
as my cursor moves onto them. Is there a way to make a swallowed xterm focus
like a window does?

2. Is there a way for a swallowed object in my buttonbar to still act as a
button. In particular I want buttons that make remote logins to other servers
which have the load graph as their face. I can make each part work seperately,
buttons for logins and others with swallowed xmeters but is there a way to
combine them?

3. Netscape doesn't seem to obey my configuration. I have smartplacement
selected in my .fvwm2rc file but rather than find an empty area netscape
allways appears in the top left corner of the screen. Is there a way to
fix this?

4. I have four separate 'pages' setup in FVWM2 and want to be able to start
a program in a different page to the one I am using. eg I am working in page
1 but want to be able to start a program in page 2. At the moment I am forced
to start the program in my current page, then make it sticky, goto the page I
want it, unstick the window, then go back to the first page again. Is there
a better way?

5. Are OpaqueMove and OpaqueResize implemented in FVWM2 or have the command
names merely changed?


Cheers,

First, I'd like to use the term "DontPassClick" as a less wordy version
of ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick.  At least, it will save on typing in
this reply!


I've actually made the change you suggest in (2) a while ago, and the
problem that I had found immediately with this is that I have a few
applications that are StaysOnTop (button bar, pager, tkgoodstuff)... 
since they are never obscured (especially now with the new
CleverPlacement code!), I'd like to keep the old behavior of just
clicking on a button and having the selected task operated on
immediately.  If DontPassClick is global, then such actions require TWO
button presses.  Yeeeccccch!  After witnessing that behavior, I
re-enabled the PassClick (the opposite of DontPassClick) behavior.


Then, I started thinking of Style flags.

How about:

	Style "*"		DontPassClick
	Style "Fvwm Pager"	PassClick
	Style "FvwmButtons"	PassClick
	Style "tkgoodstuff"	PassClick

This would allow me to have the behavior that I would prefer.  Of
course, we are awaiting the Great Style Flag Rewrite, and adding new
styles is more difficult than adding a global option, so I have up to
now held my tongue on that suggestion.  (As a nit, maybe
PassClick/NoPassClick would be more in keeping with the current style
flag naming conventions.)



Anyway, I still needed a solution, so I came up with a workaround that
requires NO changes to the existing code:

Define a Key-Mouse combination that will perform the focus and raise.

Here's the relevant part of my .fvwm2rc file:

# RaiseAndFocus -- REALLY Raise an application and focus on it:

AddToFunc	"RaiseAndFocus"
+	"I"	Iconify -1
+	"I"	Raise
+	"I"	Focus

# Meta-Button 1, 2, or 3 is Raise and Focus

Mouse	1	WTFSI	M	RaiseAndFocus
Mouse	2	WTFSI	M	RaiseAndFocus
Mouse	3	WTFSI	M	RaiseAndFocus

Then, all I had to do is get into the habit of using Meta-Button to
raise a desired application (which is pretty easy, actually).

The only downside to this solution is that it steals META-Button{1,2,3}
from applications.  But since this is .fvwm2rc that we are talking
about, a user can choose EXACTLY which Key/Button combination to use.


So, Chuck... just as a suggestion, consider DontPassClick/PassClick as
style options instead of global options, but be aware that I'm not in a
particular hurry for it right now.  [smile]

Although I didn't mention it, eventually the plan is that these will
be options/modifiers on the ClickToFocus style option, but since there
aren't enough style flags until after the GSFR, and since people keep
asking about an option like that, I figured I'd add them as global for
now.  BTW, I have a few other things planned to add like this as well
for 2.0.44:

  ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/Raises - so have only clicking on border
                                   raise, like compiling with
                                   CLICKY_MODE_1 right now,
  SmartPlacementIsReallySmart - to make it use the new CleverPlacement
                                stuff

Eventually (post GSFR) these will also become styles/style modifiers,
but I figure that global is better than nothing right now.

As far as I know you'd have to allow the whole button bar to have focus just
like a window.  I keep track of commands I'm always typing to start programs
etc and add a button instead. A swallowed xconsole takes care of error messages
and the like instead of a xterm then.

I honestly don't know about this one, I know you can do different things
with different mouse clicks...anyone else know? Its a nice idea.

No fix that I know of, it does this in my setup as well. Annoying isn't it?
Just start it with a given geometry perhaps, again quite simple if you have it on
a button.

This is why I'm always pressing for 'StartsOnPage'! :-)
You can write a function to go to a desk, start up program X, wait for X to appear,
and then return to page N. But thats irritating. I usually just start things iconic
now and slide them around in the pager using the middle mouse button whenever I have
time to open them and sort out what goes where.

I'd like to use StartsOnPage and SkipMapping to just have, say, Netscape start on another
page (it takes ages to start on my machine) and I'll move there when I've finished typing
some more email for example.

Hi volx !

fvwm-2.0.41 was/is running pretty fine. However 2.0.43 built, but when
starting up X, I get this weird error:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 ELF
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module

X is up, but my desktop doesn't appear. The only thing I costumized for
compiling was in Fvwm.tmpl.

#define InstallUtils YES

#define InstallLibs YES

I didn't compile the modules in the `extra` dir. ( They shouldn't be
required, should they ? )

Hi,
	I hope this is not a silly question but how do I get FVWM to place all
my shrunk icons along the botton of my screen without resorting to a horrible
icon box ?
  Once a new window opens and I iconise it I place it on the bottom and it
stays there but is there a way to autoplace icons a kin to 4Dwm (SGI)?
 Sorry if this is a newbie question.
TIA

Where do those things go ?
Is this the place to put patches (even BIG ones) to?

On that note: Jason, I think that any patch directory created should

This is the relevant line from my .fvwmrc:

	Style "*"           IconBox 0 +0 +90 +880

So, you could have different places for different icons. This line defines
a region where all my icons wil go to, its the top left of my screen,
down the side (if you see what I mean).

Read the 'man' page for more info.

I have just decided that I'll move all my mail windows to a different icon
box and was poking about when your mail arrived, good timing!

currently no.

NoPPosition or the like in fvwm 1.24

Correct.  There's no way to make parts of FvwmButtons be clicktofocus
and the rest be focus follows mouse.  It is only one window after all.

>> 2. Is there a way for a swallowed object in my buttonbar to still
>>    act as a button?

Not exactly.  I'm guessing that because some swallowable applications
might want to be affected by mouse clicks, mouse clicks on swallowed
apps are passed to the app rather than being used by FvwmButtons to
represent a button press.   Ironically, if you give FvwmButtons focus
and press the return key while the mouse is over a swallowed app, and
a mouse action is defined for that swallowed app, the return will work
as expected even though a mouse click won't.  However, if you put a
title on the swallowed app button, you can mouse click on that title
and it will act as a button press.  You don't need any title text, and
if you set the font real small, the title area doesn't look that bad.
In fact, I think with the right amount of padding you can center the
swallowed app, but I haven't really tried it.  Here's what I did to
get a swallowed xmeter have a blank title area that I can click on.
When I press the button it runs an xterm with top in it.

*FvwmButtons(3x1, Frame 1, Action `Exec "top" TOP`, \
	Swallow(NoClose,UseOld) XMeter "Exec XMETER", \
	Font SCHU_C_M_R_N_6, Title " ")

I use M4, so you'll have to trust me that XMETER is an appropriate
command line for the xmeter program and SCHU_C_M_R_N_6 is a really
tiny font.

Does

Style "*" NoPPosition

or 

Style "Netscape" NoPPosition

solve it?  I don't have this problem with netscape, but I use a
geometry resource setting that might override any programatic
defaults.

Yes, I want StartsOnPage too, but for now I live with specifying
geometries that span the page.  For example on my 1152x900 system I
can start an xterm with geometry +1152+0 to start one page to the
right.  However, if you do this in your rightmost page, you've got
problems :-) I find this is great for those apps I run at startup
time, but for those I start up later, I have to get them where I'm at
(except for those I put on another desktop with StartsOnDesk).

Hi folks!
I'm a newbie so please be gentle.
I installed Slackware96 from the CD-Rom distribution, and got X Window
up and running.  When fvwm is executed from .xinitrc, it can't seem to
find the .fvwmrc file in my home directory.  If I take out my .xinitrc file and
run startx, fvwm-95 comes up as default.  I'd like to run fvwm as my
window manager.  Any suggestions?
Also, what is the filename for a color_xterm resource file and where
would I look for a list of valid parameters in such a file?

Thanks for reading!

Well, if they're patches, I'll put them in an unofficial_patches directory.
if they're not patches, I'll put them in the misc directory unless they

Well, don't fill the partition with gigabyte patches.  Otherwise anything

I have .fvwmrc in my home directory, and have located the system.fvwm
file.  When fvwm is executed from .xinitrc, it does seem to find them
though.  I'm lost.  Is there another config file or system setting I'm

You  don't say, but probably you  are running fvwm2.x  and, if so, the
config file name should be:

.fvwm2rc

I have a few questions about the answers that have appeared in response to
this original post.
	First: can someone please tell me what this XMETER is? I am
running Linux, and use xload to show my system load, and am a bit confused
as to what xmeter is.
	Second: Can someone explain to me what multiple desktops (not
pages) are and how they work exactly. I too, have been awaiting the
implementation of StartsOnPage, but might find StartsOnDesk to be somewhat
helpful in the interim, if I knew what it was and how it worked.
Thanx
Todd

I recently put this in the FAQ, which you'll see updated with 2.0.44:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

27) What exactly is the differenct between a DESK, a PAGE, and the
    SCREEN?

A: Our naming convention is sometimes a source of confusion, and when
   discussing problems and the like it's good to maintain a consistent
   meaning.  To illustrate how features of fvwm should be referred to
   - fvwm has multiple disjoint DESKTOPS, each of which is comprised
   of M by N PAGES, which are each the size of the physical SCREEN.
   The physical SCREEN acts as a viewport over one of the PAGES of the
   current DESK.  Here's a picture to clarify (also, take a look at
   the FvwmPager module):

             Desk 0                     Desk 1
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     | Page 0 0 | Page 1 0 |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     |          |          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     ||Page 0 1|| Page 1 1 |    |          |          |
     ||        ||          |    |          |          |
     |+--------+|          |    |          |          |
     +----------+----------+    +----------+----------+

   It shows two 2 x 2 DESKTOPS.  If the current DESK were number 0,
   and the current PAGE were 0 1, the SCREEN would show only the
   windows located there, plus any sticky ones.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How's that?

Thanks Chuck, that did it.

EVERYONE ELSE: THANKS FOR YOUR REPLIES...BUT STOP SENDING THEM
(that should do the trick :)

This is just a message to shamelessly beg for Chuck to put the
StartsOnPage function in 2.0.44 (like he hasn't been asked that one
already :)

xmeter is a program, similar to xload in appearance, but with some
additional capabilities.  You can find it at

Thanks to everyone who answered my questions! I have another for you.

OpaqueMoveSize has done part of what I wanted but is there an equivalent command 
for Resize?

I am running fvwm-2.0.43, and am wondering if there is a way to make fvwm
turn messaging off on certain terminals that it opens (without having to
add mesg n lines before all programs I want to do this for) For instance,
when I open pine, messaging is turned off automatically it appears.
However, I would also like programs like irc and rlogin to have messaging
turned off. If anyone knows of a way to do this, please let me know.
Thanx
Todd

Could someone give me the email address of the person that maintains the 
mailing list.  I was working on my mailserver and it returned email all 
day.  Since this afternoon I've had 0 connections from the fvwm mailing 
list so I'm assuming the mail bot has stopped sending to me because of 
error msgs.

Hey folks,
Time for me to fess up.  First, thanks to all who tried to help me with my
"fvwm can't locate .fvwmrc anywhere" problem.  It was working fine all
the while.  I'm just a silly newbie still trying to get along.  I didn't quite
realize what it was actually doing.  Anyway, on the suggestion of some,
I've discovered that I have ver 1.2.
I'll try again:
I've never installed a package downloaded from the net.  What would I
need to do to upgrade to fvwm 2.x?
Is this an appropriate forum for discussion of my problems with
ghostview?  If so, I can't seem to get it to work.  If not, would someone
please direct me to another source?

Thanks again for the patient and thoughtful aid.
-Randy Cone

The problem you describe seems to be the same that I very often have when 
trying to install packages on our Solaris 2.5 machines.
In my case the problem is the call of the 'install' program in the 
Makefile.
Most often (and, indeed, also in the fvwm Makefiles), install is called 
in the following way (I only show the important options):

install -c demo /usr/local/bin/demo

installing program 'demo' from the current directory to the file 
/usr/local/bin/demo.
Unfortunately, our install program (which is a shell script for Sys V) 
doesn't recognize this version.
You have to say:

install -c /usr/local/bin demo

So a possible solution for the problem is to go through all the Makefiles 
and change each 'install' call accordingly.

Hope that helps,

	Ulrich

Another solution is to a) put "/usr/ucb" in your path before "/usr/sbin",
or edit the Makefile(s) to explicity use /usr/ucb/install [assuming you
have the /usr/ucb stuff installed]. Also, some gnu software installs the
GNU install program. That one is also compatible with the existing
makefiles.

an xterm that has been swallowed by FvwmButtons.
like 
*FvwmButtons(10x2, Swallow (UseOld, NoClose, Respawn) "Console" "X console -display $HOSTDISPLAY -geometry 70x5-1500-1500")

(Console is a local script that starts 
	xterm -C  if i log in on the display of my main computing host
	and plain xterm if I log in from a remote display.

if you start xterm -e pine, you should add mesg n in front of that.
ugly, I know
but sth like 
Function XtermApp "I" xterm -e /usr/bin/tcsh "mesg n;exec $1 $2 $3"

might help.

if you start a normal xterm and start the commands there, shell aliases
should do the trick.

So in order to restore such an xterm, I'd click the appropriate FVWM button
and it would come up?

Does anybody have an xdm binary that works with shadow passwds or know 
where I can find it?  I need the binary because I've upgraded to X 312 
using binary files and don't have the source to compile xdm with shadow 
passwd checking enabled.

Thanx in advance,

The latest version of XFree has xdm support for shadow passwords.  I'm 
not on it right now, but I belive in the bin. version there were two 
versions of xdm (xdm and xdm-shadow).  I also believe that it was in the 
same path as good ol' xdm.

Sorry, but this is not a function of fvwm, it's a function of the shell
you are using.  Your options are to:  a> set mesg n in your login, and
turn messages on for apps you want them on, or b> the exact opposite.

I believe I control this for all my xterms with the x-resource:

XTerm*utmpInhibit: 	true

Since this is an x-resource, I don't see why it couldn't be controlled
from the command line with "-xrm".

Hi. How can I make it so that even when I click in/on/around a window,
it NEVER gets the focus? I still need a border around the window, so
anything involving removing the border is out. Thanks for any help you
can give!

I have discovered, and patched, a bug in 2.0.43.

If a Motif client quickly maps and then immediately unmaps a window, the events sent
are:
 client:   MapRequest
           synthetic UnmapNotify with selecting window ('event') equal to the root
 fvwm:     Map (as per MapRequest)
           synthetic UnmapNotify ignored because 'event' field (selecting window)
                not equal to 'window' (window being unmapped)

The result is typically a blank window; moreover, as far as the application is
concerned this window isn't there.

Comments and code in events.c appear to be checking for this synthetic event;
however, because of the immediately preceeding 'if' statement the code in
question will never get executed:


void HandleUnmapNotify()
{
  int dstx, dsty;
  Window dumwin;
  XEvent dummy;
  extern FvwmWindow *colormap_win;

  if(Event.xunmap.event != Event.xunmap.window)
    return;
  /*
   * The July 27, 1988 ICCCM spec states that a client wishing to switch
   * to WithdrawnState should send a synthetic UnmapNotify with the
   * event field set to (pseudo-)root, in case the window is already
   * unmapped (which is the case for fvwm for IconicState).  Unfortunately,
   * we looked for the FvwmContext using that field, so try the window
   * field also.
   */
  if (!Tmp_win)
    {
      Event.xany.window = Event.xunmap.window;
      if (XFindContext(dpy, Event.xany.window,
                       FvwmContext, (caddr_t *)&Tmp_win) == XCNOENT)
        Tmp_win = NULL;
    }

The obvious quick fix is to remove the if statement and Unmap() the window.
However, presumably the if statement is there for some reason; so my patch
changes the if statement to return if the 'event' and 'window' fields don't
match AND the 'event' field is not the root window, or the event is not
synthetic (send_event is false).

The patch is attached.

I realize this is a moron question, but I fit the bill, so...

How does one startup fvwm upon login?  An entry in the ~/.xinitrc file?

I've written a new module for fvwm2.  As far as I know I had not seen
this and remember that it was on the todo list.

FvwmCascade is a simple module to cascade windows.  There are a few
options to control how and what windows are cascaded.  I've attached
the man page so you can read that.  I'm also working on an FvwmTile
module.

You can retrieve it at:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_modules.html

Here is the man page:

FvwmCascade(1)           FvwmCascade 0.5           FvwmCascade(1)


NAME
       FvwmCascade - layer FVWM windows

SYNOPSIS
       FvwmCascade is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.


DESCRIPTION
       This module attempts to cascade  windows  on  the  current
       screen  subject  to certain constraints.  Layering is per-
       formed so  consecutive  windows  will  have  their  window
       titles visible underneath the previous.


INVOCATION
       FvwmCascade  is best invoked from a menu, popup or button.
       There are a number of command line options  which  can  be
       used to constrain the layering, these are described below.
       As an example case, one could call  FvwmCascade  with  the
       following arguments:

            FvwmCascade 100p 100p 400p 300p


       This  invocation  will  cascade  windows starting at pixel
       location 100, 100 on the screen and  constrain  the  width
       and height to 400 and 300 pixels respectively.

       Command-line arguments passed to FvwmCascade are described
       here.

       -a     Causes _a_l_l window styles to be affected

       -desk  Causes all windows  on  the  desk  to  be  cascaded
              instead of the current screen only.

       -flatx Inhibits border width increment.

       -flaty Inhibits border height increment.

       -noraise
              Inhibits window raising, leaving the depth ordering
              intact.

       -r     Reverses the window sequence.

       -t     Causes  transient  windows  to  also  be   affected
              (implied by -all).

       -u     Causes   untitled   windows  to  also  be  affected

              an  affected  window  exceeds  either this width or

BUGS
       It  is  probably  not  a good idea to delete windows while
       windows are being cascaded.

Either add the StartIconic option or start it like this:

    xterm -iconic &

The "-iconic" option is the trick.  Some programs do not grok this
option.  For those, you need StartIconic (that's an option in .fvwmrc
-- ``Style "xterm" StartIconic'').

AddToFunction "IconifyOrElse"

AddToFunction "InitFunction"

Where 'WindowName' is the name of the window you want to iconify.  You
can get the windowname using the FvwmIdentify Module.

Hey,

  How do you get fvwm to activate a window just by clicking the mouse  
inside the boundaries of the window?  (as opposed to activating by
clicking on the top, or by just entering the window)

thanks,

jamie

I am looking fo a nice turkey icon? Since FVWM'ers seem to have the better
icon collection and knowledge I was hoping one of you might be able to help
us out. We have not had much luck yet with the web search engines, though we
are still looking.

Thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving!

Hi all,

I have fetched a bunch of *.jpg files from a www page that I wish
to use as background textures for my workstation.  Does anyone know
where a utility exists that I can use to convert these jpeg images to xpm 
format ??

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have two questions. First, Is there a way that I can make a button(on the
new fvwm2rc95-fvwm95-2.0.41) that goes directly to a telnet location? By this
I mean: I want to click on a button that takes me automatically takes me to a
location, let's say info.rutgers.edu. or 150.333.3435.554 whatever. Is this
possible? My second question is how do I get the Autoraise function to NOT be
executed at startup.  I hate having to turn it off each time I enter.  Thank
you for your time.

You can convert these jpeg images to xpm format by using xv. After you
load the jpeg images in xv you just click "save" and then click the format
button and choose xpm then click "Ok" button.

XV will do this, but it may end up being easier to use xv to display the
files rather than xpmroot. To do this, use `xv -root -quit some_file.jpg'.
The colours look nicer with XV, IMO, and the files are smaller than pixmaps.

    Thanks! You've found the missing piece I've been overlooking! 

GM>>  If a Motif client quickly maps and then immediately unmaps a window...

    The problem is not limited to Motif apps. It also shows up with certain
Tk apps (well, we know of one, anyway) that use the TkSteal extension to
reparent an xterm window into a Tk frame. This was reported a few weeks
back by Michael Schumacher <mike@hightec.saarlink.de>. It is due to the same
oversight you've found.

    I sent Chuck a tentative patch that works for the reparenting case, but
that I was never comfortable with, because it doesn't catch the synthetic 
Unmap here, but detects the problem later, when we get the MapNotify and can
see that the parent has changed.

    ***  Chuck:  I have tested Grant's changed Unmap logic against Tgdb,
and it does clear up their reparent problem as well. This is clearly the
right place to detect the condition, and has broader applicability. 
Feel free to discard my version.

GM>>  The obvious quick fix...presumably the if statement is there for some
GM>>  reason...

    Yup. Although removing it makes the code look superficially more like 
version 1's handling, significant changes have been made in this area (I'm
not familiar with their history.) Removing the if produces decidedly 
unpleasant results.

    Thanks again!

Exactly !! u have to add a line to u'r .xinitrc file. 
and do not forget to comment out the line corrosponding to the older WM
If u wish to have the option of selecting a Window manager at the time
of login from amongst many(olwm, mwm, fvwm2.0.43,fvwm95 etc) then u may ask me for my 
 .login file
 ITS nothing great..

Have fun.

Jamie,

You can do this by setting Style "*" ClickToFocus and then using the
FvwmAuto module to autoraise windows.  In addition, Chuck is planning
to add a flag if you want to pass the first click to the app or not (I
think now it does go to the app).

Later,
Andrew

I've not tried it with telnet, but it should work in of these two ways:
Either you let the button start up an xterm which automatically runs 
telnet:

*FvwmButtons(Title "Info", Action 'Exec xterm -e telnet info.rutgers.edu 
&' )

Or you use an X-based telnet like xtelnet:

*FvwmButtons( Title "Info", Action 'Exec xtelnet info.rutgers.edu &')

Just remove or comment the call to the Autoraise module in your 
.fvwm2rc95 file (the module is called FvwmAuto).

I don't use fvwm-95 but the Buttons work in much the same way as in fvwm-2.0.41
so add or change a button definition to:

*FvwmButtons Rutgers mini-term.xpm Exec "" xterm -sb -sl 2500 -T "info.rutgers.edu" -n "Telnet" -e telnet info.rutgers.edu &

(all one line)

Put this in the section of the .fvwm2rc95 file with all the other *FvwmButton 
lines and then when you restart you should have a new button called "Rutgers"
which will start up an xterm and telnet into info.rutgers.edu. This should
answer your first question.

I've just put new versions of both of my new modules, FvwmCascade and
FvwmTile on my modules page. Of course, the new member is FvwmTile
which lets you tile windows in all sorts of ways.  FvwmCascade also
has a new option to force windows to resize to a certain height.  Both
of these modules are sort of complementary.

Both modules are available in a gzipped tar file off of the following
page:

A button to go directly to a telnet location:

These modules are pretty nice, and they work nicely with fvwm95-2.0.42a
as well as fvwm2.0.43 (just to let you know).

One comment that I can see coming up is that maybe have some support for
a tile or cascade 'region' -- for instance, many fvwm95 users have a
task bar on the screen that can get obscured by these modules.  In
addition, there are lots of people with button bars, pagers, and whatnot
that they don't want obscured.

I was thinking that a simple solution would be to add some new
parameters:

*FvwmCascadeRegion	0 20  1280 1004
*FvwmTileRegion		0 20  1280 1004

This would limit the region in which the windows are placed to the
rectangle defined by the corners (0,20) and (1280,1004), leaving the 20
pixels from the top and 20 pixels from the bottom clear of any added
windows (assuming a 1280x1024 screen size).

The other possible solution (which I think would be more difficult) is
to determine where StaysOnTop windows appear on the screen and avoid
those areas, sort of the way the CleverPlacement code works.

no, with fvwmButtons, a swallowed xterm is always usable.
mind my command line above: I have a 70characters by 5 lines xterm, which
is an integral part of my ButtonBar (thus without decoration and sticky).

I use it to start X applications and the like.

everything clear now?

Are you sure this is not handled with the command line parameters for

FvwmTile 0p 20p 1280p 1004p
FvwmCascade 0p 20p 1280p 1004p

I think these will do what you want.  You read the man page?  I'm
just curious since I thought it was stated fairly clear there, unless
this is something completely different.

btw, I just put 0.8a on there which omits Sticky windows unless they
are activated by a flag...

Andrew

But, I believe this is already implemented. The way I have it is
+ "&Tile"                     Module FvwmTile -u -mn 2 -m 0 0 97 97
in one of my menus which tiles the windows from 0,0 to 97,97 percent of
screen size - quoting from the manual - 
Up to four numbers can be placed on the command line that are not
switches.  The first pair specify an x and y offset to start the first
window (default is 0, 0).  The second pair specify an absolute
coordinate reference denoting the lower right bounding box for tiling. 
If any number is suffixed with the letter p, then it is taken to be a
pixel value, otherwise it is interpreted as a screen percentage.

Testing it out it already ignores sticky windows which are stays on top.
What I would really like however is to be able to specify tile the
windows in a maxtrix format but with a *minimum* size....any chance?

I use the clicktofocus in fvwm, but with the shift key
pressed, I have to click on the window title bar to get
the focus.   Does anyone know how to set fvwm to allow 
clicktofocus to function with the shift (or caps lock)
key pressed??

Thanks

I suspected that other applications would have the same problem; however,
since I have only observed - and tested - this with Motif, I limited my
comments to Motif.

How about a flag to allow cascading offsets to be specified on the
command line?  I'd like the cascaded windows to be shifted
horizontally by more than the border width.

For the next version, I'll add an offset arg for each direction.
This could be combined with the -flat* options to get rid of
the border increment entirely (since border widths vary).

Hey,

  Why won't my cursor allow me to go to an adjacent desktop when 
it reaches the end of the current screen?  I have my EdgeResistance
parameters set to 0 0....

thanks

It was designed that way.  You use desks when you don't want the
cursor to move there by going to the edge of the screen, else you use
pages.

Hi all! 

   I found from where the bloody "dot cursor stick" come out. Well,
I do not have a fix, but I can show you that Knows :-) how to reproduce 
it. The bug is FvwmAuto related (it disappear if I KillModule FvwmAuto). 

1) Set up FvwmAuto 1500 (quite a long delay), and a title button  
   menu with a "close" option (everyone have one... or not?)
2) Fire up an xcalc.
3) partially obscure xcalc with another window (e.g., rxvt)
4) Now, go on the xcalc button title menu and, _before_ the xcal window 
   raise up, pull down the menu.
5) Wait the timeout (window do not raise because you have the menu on 
   with mouse key pressed.
6) Select close

That's it! Now you have the "dot" and you have to click and here the beep 
before using your mouse again.

Hope this helps,
                  Romano

I've been playing  around with FvwmCascade and FvwmTile, Tile is not of
much interest to me, but I can see situations where I might use Cascade...

BUT...

Is there currently a way of excluding windows other than making them 
untitled? Ideally I'd like all my sticky windows to be exempt as I've
put them where I want them to stay!

Cheers,

=> Hmmm. Okay what version have you got. I've got 0.8 which seems to work
=> okay? With
=>  Module FvwmCascade -sizeup -m 0 0 80 80
=> my sticky windows are ignored.... what have you got in your file?
=> Nick
=> 

I'm running 0.8 too, and I invoke it with 

FvwmCascade 100p 100p

I tried it with -sizeup and there was no change. (Incidentally, this is on
Solaris 2.5 on a Sun SPARC 5, fvwm 2.0.43 with applied titlebar and border-
style patches.) 

Do your sticky windows have titles? I have about four stickys on my screen
but only one of them has a title, and it's this one that is Cascading. 
My guess is (and If Andrew Veliath wants to jump in here go ahead) 
your stickys don't  have titles and so since you don't have the -u switch 
set, they are unaffected by Cascade.

Hi Paul

This was a problem I encountered as I have lots of information in
titles: working directory in xterms, filename in emacs, doc title in
netscape, etc etc.

The solution, for me anyway, was to use
  Style "*" Icon none
which just produces the icon title bar (I like things minimalist anyway!).
This hilighted what I thought were two bugs in fvwm:

1. The icon title bar width is calculated only when the application is
iconified for the *first* time. If the title subsequently changes
this width is no longer correct.

The following patch causes the icon to be redrawn on *every* iconify
for applications with no icon pixmap (the overhead is pretty trivial).

2. If the icon title changes whilst the application is iconified the event
is trapped and the title changed, but the width not recalculated.

The following patch redraws the icon on such an event for icons with
no pixmap. Note that this will cause the icon to move if it gets wider and
no longer fits its current slot in the iconbox.

I have my iconbox running horizontally across the top of the screen,
and a long document title in netscape can cause the icon to be almost
half the screen width. This doesn't matter as I save so much vertical
space by not having icon pixmaps. I discriminate applications by using
different colours on the decorations.

Try these patches and see if they do what you want.

BTW, Chuck, are you going to include these in the next beta? I can't
remember what you said last time.

If you want to get the messages from fvwm you could use the 'xsession'
program (from your local X mirror, or ftp.x.org).

This runs as your session manager and also starts the window manager.
For example, as the last line in my ~/.xsession I have:
  xsession -defaultWM fvwm2

xsession has a little window which display fvwm messages, and also
provides a menu to switch between different window managers (very
useful for debugging purposes).

Hi all,

I use fvwm 2.0.43 on Solaris 2.5 (OpenWindows) in ClickToFocus mode.
I have enabled the "don't pass click to just focused window" stuff in
fvwm/events.c.  I think that the following behavior occurs with either
setting, however.

When a program has its own way of selecting another frame (Netscape
has a "Windows" menu, Emacs has a "Frames" menu as well as a
keybinding to go to the next frame) the newly-selected window doesn't
automatically get focus.

In reality, this is wrong.  If the window to be selected needs to be
mapped or deiconified the window just selected gets focus, but if the
window is already mapped and just needs to be raised, it DOESN'T get
focus.

Fvwm's own mechanism, using the WindowList, say, always works.

What's the story?

Hi,

using CleverPlacement (or SmartPlacement) is it now possible to ignore
certain kinds of windows (ie pretend they weren't there)?  I always
keep an xclock on my screen, but if it needs to be obscured by some
other window, that's fine.  So, if a new window can be placed by
obscuring an xclock or by obscuring part of an xterm, I'd like it to
always prefer the former alternative.

Can it?

tia,
kai

I'm cant seem to get programs that install their own colormaps
(netscape -install) to work propperly.  It's like the colomap install fails
silently, or simply has no effect.

If anybody has any clues as to how to fix this, please get in touch :-)

Use the DeskTopSize command:

    DeskTopSize 4x5

Also, afaik, the FvwmPager module shows the desk titles, but it
doesn't if you iconify it.  You can then use the icon as a view onto
the current desktop.

You *can* suppress the title in the pager.  I have this in my .fvwm2rc
file, and as far as I remember it was what I needed to supress the
title:

Good morning,

	Please reply this to elad@cs.bgu.ac.il. I'm not on the list
account of being overmailed as it is, but I read the whole list archieve
today searching for these answers.

	Only recently I decided I needed a Window Manager, so I
more-or-less dumped MWM in favour of fvwm2-95. It took me a while to
compile it (Currently on Iris, Aix and Sun. Next in the list are Solaris
and Linux, maybe.

	The first issue is really annoying: Under MWM (which came
preconfigured from the gods, more or less), the focus went wherever the
mouse was, and a mouse click on a mouse caused it to raise. I tried to
achieve a similiar affect using "Mouse 1 W A Raise" and it worked, only
that the mouse click never arrived to the application in the window. Not
good, not good. Anyone can help me with this, please?

	The second is more than a luxury. 80% of my windows are xterms
opened to different hosts. There's a script I use which open xterms with
different window colors & titles to every host, but what I want now is to
configure fvwm Styles to different hosts - (the mini-icon comes to mind).
The man says that Style parameter can accept "Window name", but trial &
error shows me that it does not mean "Window Title"... Right? Am I missing
something here? If I don't, can I give different styles to different
window titles?

This list has very moderate traffic, so subscribing to it would
probably not increase the volume of your incoming mail by a
lot. Besides, if you really have problems with too much mail, I would
strongly suggest that you take a look at "procmail". Properly
installed, it will filter all of your incoming mail into different
spool files. I have installed it in a way, that sorts all mailinglists
into files that are read by my newsreader (XEmacs/Gnus). Thus I hardly
notice a difference betweeen mailing lists and news.

Your description of the desired behavior is a little bit ambiguous, so
I am not quite sure that I understand you. Anyways, have you played
around with 

Style "*"            SloppyFocus
Style "*"            ClickToFocus
Style "*"            MouseFocus

You should also investigate, whether you want to (de)install FvwmAuto.

If you use ClickToFocus and do not like the way the way FVWM (does
not) suppress(es) the first mouse click being passed to the
application, then I believe newer releases of FVWM have an option that
controls this behavior. As I still use FVWM 2.0.42, I cannot tell you
which option this is.

Might I suggest, that you install a little script that is sourced by
your login shells? This enables your xterm to display the host, userid
and current directory in the title bar of the window; these entries
will automatically be updated whenever they change:

if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]; then
  xterm_title() { echo -n '^[]2;'$USER@${HOSTNAME%%.*}"  -  "$PWD'^G^[]1;'$USER@${HOSTNAME%%.*}'^G' }
  PROMPT_COMMAND=xterm_title
fi

(you need to replay ^[ with the escape character, and ^G with
control-G) This script assumes that you use "bash"; you will have to
modify it, if you use a different shell.

Use the "Identify" command to figure out the names of your
windows. You can tell "xterm" to use a different name by passing the
"-name" command line parameter. The drawback is, that this also
effects resources, so it will no longer find its default
resources. You might get by, by either establishing symbolic links in
your app-defaults directory or by passing all resources on the command
line (using the "-xrm" option). Anyways, I assume there are better
ways of doing what you want. Only I do not really understand what this
is :-) Could you post a more detailed description of your
problem. What I do for distinguishing between different hosts, is to
modify the background color. This can easily be achieved by passing
the proper "-xrm" option when lauching the "xterm".

I'm using FVWM95 which comes with Slackware 3.1.  On the
start menu under modules there is a module named fvwmconfig.
Unfortunately, the module doesn't exist in the installation,
nor on any of the 6 infomagic CD's.  Was this put in as a
forethought?  Does it exist?  If so, where abouts can I get
it?

Thanks in advance.

Objects, sounds great ! If the wm is properly abstracted one could use it as
a model for other wm. But... what about the infamous C++ code bloat and
related performance issues ? Other GUI's which are object oriented seam to
suffer from such issues. N*xt for example, while Macrosoft's object OS has
been put on the back-burner and it is rumored that the only application MS
has written using object frameworks is w*rdpad. Personally I prefer object
methodologies has long as not to much performance is sacrificed.

Here is where things begin to get cloudy. There are differences between X
and win95, things such as frame buffers, messages and events methods, to
name a few. A good article relating to this can be found in the July/August
1994 issue of The X Journal. It's called Implementing the Windows API on
U*NIX/M*tif, and it describes the experiences from some one who worked on a
similar project, from the trenches point of view. 
Perhaps the best approach is a compromise and use the best features of win95
and M*tif. As long as the user can run M*tif applications using this vm,
M*tif compliance may become a secondary issue. 
Here are some features I would like to see:
-use of buffers to improve performance.
-use DLL's to implement controls (widgets) thus providing flexibility and
extendibility.
-create something akin to the registry, a policy database which can be
modified using a policy editor.
-A scripting language which could be used to write macros, such as MS VBA. A
good candidate would be Java.
-Some sort of printer support such as it is found in win95.

>A new class library for developing applications is being written, with
win95 look and feel, and including as 
>many as controls (widgets) as Win95 has. 
Will it include the new controls which MS uses in O*fice97 ?
What about an IDE for programmers ?

>A separate, generic wm-communication API library would be also available.
A scripting language which could be used to communicate with the vm. A good
candidate would be Java.

>There is not a fixed policy, or direction, in the fvwm development, except,
perhaps, making it infinitely configurable. 
I agree that it should be infinitely configurable. However global
configuration which can be overwritten by the application should be the
standard.

If the above can be achieved then Linux, X95 vm, Xclass95 will provide the
functionality to compete head on with the evil Macrosoft empire, at a
fraction of the cost.  

On a final note, has any consideration being given to legal issues such as
copyright and patent infringement ?
If company has the resources to engage in a legal battle with a US
government agency on trade practices ... enough said.  

Cheers,

David
