Yes, the FVWM list has moved!  This message is a followup to my earlier
message to the old fvwm list at wonderland.org.  If you receive this you're
on the list and will continue to receive discussion.

For those of you who have been subscribed to the digest, you most likely
haven't yet received my message to the old list.  I include it below.

=== Begin Included Text ===
As you may have read in previous messages here, this list is moving.  Peter
Galbavy has graciously donated his time in maintaining the list, and now he
has handed it over to me.  I have acquired the subscription lists and have
set things up at my machine, hpc.uh.edu, where I run several other mailing
lists.  All further submissions should go to fvwm@hpc.uh.edu.  All further
list maintenance (subscribes, unsubscribes, etc.) should go to
majordomo@hpc.uh.edu.  To talk to a human, write fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu
(that's me).

I have decided not to continue the digest.  I do this for several reasons.
Firstly, with all of the setup, maintenance, and the slew of bounces I'm
likely to get from the initial announcements I have enough to do.
Secondly, I think this list has a low enough traffic that a digest version
really isn't warranted.  Thirdly, I disagree in principle to digests of
discussion lists, since the digest format makes it difficult to reply to
individual messages and you invariably get problems with someone quoting
the entire digest back to the list and such.  It's too much headache.
Perhaps in the future another person will offer to digest the list for
those of you who can't live without it.  Hoping to err on the side of
completeness, I have added all of those who subscribed to the digest to the
normal list.

I will send a test message to the new list to check for bounces and failed
addresses.  Everyone should receive this.  If you do not receive both this
message and the message from the new list, something has been fouled up and
you should subscribe yourself to the new list by sending the message
"subscribe fvwm" to majordomo@hpc.uh.edu or you will begin to miss list
traffic.

Thanks again, Peter.

FYI, Let met tell you that I couldn't agree less with your third point. I'm on
several mailing lists which I (and numerous others) receive in digest form, and
neither are they difficult to reply to, nor have I ever (in the last couple of
years) seen anyone quote an entire digest to a list. (Maybe I didn't look too
well ;-)

It's just a matter of using the right mail readers ...

Thanks for all the effort though.

Carl.

On my system, the titlebar's height (= the buttons' size) is 18 pixels.
Is there some way of changing that?
----- End of forwarded message from Adrian Lozano -----

You can change the title font. This automatically adjusts the title bar height.

Since I am the one who is guilty for the extra quoting in the first place, I
guess it's me who has to clear things up:
In your script

> #!/bin/sh -vx
> fvwm-2.0pl25 -f \"FvwmM4 ... $DOTDIR/fvwmrc-2.x/fvwm-main\"

you tell the shell explicitely _not_ to use the double quotes "..." to group
several command line arguments into one, but instead tell it to split them
(but precede the first one with a `"' and to put another `"' at the end of
the last argument. Spoken in argv[]'s, fvwm gets:

(assuming DOTDIR=/home/shaggy/.dotdir):
    argv[0] = fvwm-2.0pl25
    argv[1] = -f
    argv[2] = "FvwmM4
    argv[3] = -debug
    argv[4] = -m4-prefix
    argv[5] = -m4opt
    argv[6] = -I/home/shaggy/.dotdir/fvwmrc-2.x
    argv[7] = /home/shaggy/.dotdir/fvwmrc-2.x/fvwm-main"
    argv[8] = (NULL)
So it tries to execute a program ``"FvwmM4'' which of course is unavailable.
Instead, what you want is
    argv[0] = fvwm-2.0pl25
    argv[1] = -f
    argv[2] = FvwmM4  -debug -m4-prefix -m4opt  -I/home/shaggy/.dotdir/fvwmrc-2.x /home/shaggy/.dotdir/fvwmrc-2.x/fvwm-main
    argv[3] = (NULL)

You'll have to drop the '\\' to achieve that:
> #!/bin/sh -vx
> fvwm-2.0pl25 -f "FvwmM4 ... $DOTDIR/fvwmrc-2.x/fvwm-main"

I had the extra \" in mind for the case where you have to put the window
manager command into an environment variable, say (not recommended!)...
    WINDOW_MANAGER="fvwm-2.0pl25 -f \"FvwmM4 ... $DOTDIR/fvwmrc-2.x/fvwm-main\""
    eval exec $WINDOW_MANAGER

I'd just like to second Carl's sentiments. IMHO the FVWM digest was ideal for
keeping upto date on what was happening with FVWM without the hassle of 
constant e-mails throughout the day. I too must confess I've never seen
anyone quote an entire digest to a list.

Many thanks for going to the trouble at all though.

Really?  It happens on the Dream Theater mailing list at least once a

Howdy all!

My first maintenance of fvwm is ready.  pre-2.0 patchlevel 35 is now
uploaded to the new ftp site (ftp.hpc.uh.edu /pub/fvwm).  Actually, it
may not have been moved to that directory yet, but Jason should be
getting to that shortly.

Here's what's new:

pl 34 to 35

Another point to not bother with the digest is;

If you have the right mail readers, and the right mail filters,  then you 
really should not need some one to make a digest for you, you should be 
able to do something similar yourself.

I am trying to install the fvwm in my home directory. Because I don't have permission for
the root directory, I could not install it in to the root directory like the original
config.h  file did.
Is is possible to install fvwm in my home directory?
What could be wrong with fvwm when executing it with error message like binary
file non executable?

Your hints would be greatly appreciated.

I have to say at this point that I was subscribed to a couple of the
linux mailing lists, which used to be strictly in digest form, and I 
regularly found that more than half the topics under discussion were
something like "Re: linux-kernel-digest may 26", which is completely
useless if you are scanning headers for keywords.

It may be that most people who use digests intentionally know what they
are doing, and are capable of editing their Subject line, but I
certainly got sick of them from my experience.

As far as the problem of mailing lists causing floods of strange mail
throughout the day that one must wade through to find the email from the
boss about the meeting he wants to have this afternoon, I just use
procmail to filter everything, and all the heavy-traffic lists go to
pseudo news groups, that I read later.


>Many thanks for going to the trouble at all though.

I'll certainly second that. :-)

	But having one 30k mail is easier on the transport system (UUCP
in my case) and causes LESS overhead than receiving 60 individual messages.
My generous provider(s) will also be happier with fewer spool files around.

Hi,

I'm still having probs with emacs 19.25 and .29 (and I assume all in
between) here on a Sparc 5 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and fvwm pre-2.0pl35.
Emacs was configured with sparc-sun-sunos4shr --with-x-toolkit=athena
 --with-gcc.

This problem does *not* happen in any other window manager (twm, mwm,
vtwm.gamma), including fvwm 1.24r, so I'm still inclined to think it's an
fvwm pre-2.0 bug, not an emacs bug.  I'm hoping someone can help...

If the first X-related thing done to a frame is to turn off the menu bar,
then the window doesn't resize appropriately; it shrinks down when the menu
bar disappears, but doesn't resize (increase height by 1) when emacs
resizes its buffer to take advantage of the extra room.  This results in a
hidden minibuffer, until I manually resize the window using the window
manager.  I can duplicate this with a test file:

(menu-bar-mode nil)

and then loading it, i.e.,

	emacs -q -l test-menu.el &

The results are even more dramatic -- big white space at the bottom of a
resized window -- if I have the line

(setq default-frame-alist '((width . 80) (height . 49) (menu-bar-lines . 0)))

instead (with no X resources set; the default height is 40).

I believe this is an fvwm bug, though I can't check the emacs because the
frame operations, I think, are primitive.  Help?

Thanks,
Eric

	My fvwm is up and running. I am using GoodStuff.
	Some Buttons on the GoodStuff remain depressed
	while others come back to there original state.
	What statement do I have to use in my fvwmrc to
	avoid this?
	
	At home I have almost the same look and feel
	like at work, but each desktop is bigger than
	the physical screen. My "EdgeResistance is 10000
	0" so I don't scroll into the next desktop. How
	do I adjust the size of the desktop to fit the
	physical screen size? It is frustrating to see
	the static icons move when the mouse moves
	towards the edge of the desktop.
	
	Thank you.

I just installed fvwm 2pl35 (thanks chuck :-) and had several problems
with it:

- fvwm.man and xpmroot.man seem to be missing (perhaps did I mess up
  things...)

- for each window that is created/deleted, FvwmIconBox prints errors
  on the console like

Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
Major opcode of failed request:  66 
Resource id of failed request:  0x0 
Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)

Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
Major opcode of failed request:  66 
Resource id of failed request:  0x0 
etc.

  In fact it seems to happen each time a window gets the focus.

- Although I have a 'Style "Fvwm*" NoIcon' line in my .fvwmrc, an
  empty icon appears for it in FvwmIconBox. I guess it is related to the
  "No Name" patch, but since I do not have the man page...

- It would be nice to have an option to put the man pages somewhere
  else than in the default Imake location.

Other than that, things work generally well. Thanks to Rob for things
done and to Chuck for things to come...

Jean-Marc.

Yup: ytsejam@arastar.com

I don't find it overly interesting any more, but it is useful for tour

I had to make two changes to configure.h. 
One is new for pl-35, the other I have always made. I think both of these 
changes should be made for pl-36. (A patch follows.)

This first one is that I had to put the following back;
/* Imake command needed to put modules in desired target location */
/* Use the second version if it causes grief */
#define TARGET_DIR BINDIR=FVWMDIR
/* #define TARGET_DIR */

If you just "#define TARGET_DIR", you will have your modules installed
in the X11 bin directory (/usr/local/X11R6/bin in my case). The intent
is to have them installed in FVWMDIR (i.e /usr/local/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2).
Otherwise you may not be able to run fvwm and fvwm2 concurently.


The second one  is that I always comment out;
/*************************************************************************
 *
 * Really, no one but me should need this 
 *
 ************************************************************************/
/*
#if defined __sun__ && !defined SYSV
#define BROKEN_SUN_HEADERS          
#endif
*/


Here is the patch;
*** 1.1	1995/09/20 20:30:43

A while ago I found UNIX style man pages for all of the fvwm modules... 
and I was happy....  But then my computer crashed and burned, I lost just 
about everything, and I've had to rebuild from scratch... but I can't 
remember where I found those man pages...  and now I am sad....

Can anyone help me out?

yes, but Imake is not aware of this fact, and make install.man fails

I don't get any notices that new patches of fvwm is released, the only
hint about it I get is in the bug reports posted here. What do I have
to do to get the news of new versions??

I don't know if this already in fvwm or not, I haven't found it...
Would it be possible to have some macro in fvwm that would mean 'the contents
of the pasteboard', so that one could mark a filename, hit a key, and have an
editor pop up, editing that file?
I am currently using the following:
Key F9           A       M      Exec "Netscape go" exec netscape -remote
"openURL "`xselection PRIMARY` &

where xselection is a program which echos the current pasteboard. Then I can
mark a URL, hit alt-F9, and netscape jumps to that URL. I think it would be
very usefull to have this in fvwm, maybe even have different commands executed
depending on whether something is selected or not.

Apply this patch in the fvwm directory. Maybe I should add a
more sophisticated improvement to the module instead of using the
patch, though.

Hi there,

please excuse me if you've seen this before, mail has been acting up
here lately.

It's been some time since I've looked into AutoRaise under fvwm 2.0.
>From then, I remember that AutoRaise couldn't be enabled on a
per-window basis, it was all-or-nothing.

Now, I'm a great fan of AutoRaise on a per-window basis, and now that
AutoRaise is separated into a module, I think I could actually
implement this myself (including AutoLower, while I'm at it).
However, I don't know how to do this.  In particular, how do I make a
module that somehow receives enter window and leave window
notifications including the window id?

Is there any precedent for modules that maintain a per-window state
during their execution, part of which is determined statically on
start up (such as: always auto-raise XTerm windows), part of which
changes during run-time (such as: I want this window here to
auto-raise from now on)?

I'll be grateful for any information regarding already implemented
features like this, or examples I could look at, or documentation I
could download.

tia,
        \kai{}

Nope, I caused this...  I moved them into a specific man directory
under the top level, but forgot to put that in the ChangeLog.  I was
considering moving the module man pages as well, but hadn't decided if
that was a good idea or not.  Anyone have an opinion on that?  I could
just as easily put the man pages that I moved back where they were

I think that these FvwmIconBox problems are all related to the NoClass
changes.  I think I may switch it back to actually inserting the Class
'NoClass' again like it was before (haven't decided yet) as I'm not
certain what the benefit of the change really was (have to look at it
a little closer).

I have a partial fix from Suzuki-san for FvwmIconBox that essentially
throws those names back in there.  Don't know if it fixes all of those
problems though.

Good idea.  I'll put it on the TO-DO list.

No problem (for my part). :)

Well, fvwm doesn't send that info (focus changes being the closest
thing to that), and I think that it would be just too expensive to
have it send that level of info.

But, I don't see why a module couldn't get the window id's from fvwm,
and check the windows for a style flag (after I make the mods to allow
more styles, that is) or have it's own config info with the window
names/classes (which could be done now, much like how FvwmIconBox was
done at first) that says to auto raise it.

Then, the FvwmAuto module could monitor Enter & Leave notify X events
for those windows itself, rather than get the info from fvwm.  Then,
it could send commands to fvwm based on those events.

Check out xev from the X11 distribution (it can take a window id),
since that monitors events like that, for an example.

I don't think so, but this could be a start.  I don't use AutoRaise
myself, but I think it sounds like a good idea and I think people
would like that.

Kai> I'll be grateful for any information regarding already

Well, take a look at xev for starters.  I'm sure that adding the event
monitoring stuff to FvwmAuto should be pretty simple for starters.
And take a look at FvwmWinList for how to get the list of windows from
fvwm.

As for adding the additional style options & flags - that's high on my
list for right after the first official distribution of fvwm2.
Speaking of which - does anyone see anything glaring that should be
cleared up before the release?

Hello Chuck and all others,

I am peeping at fvwm 2.0 as it develops. I wonder wether the function
"OpaqueResize" from fvwm 1.x has been renamed, accidently removed or 
permanently removed?

I've checked the manpages, the FAQ, ChangeLog and the fvwmrc conversion 
script, and found nothing. 

Almost the same goes for the fvwm 1.x statement "include". I've found that
one can use the Statement "Read" with the same functionality, but I
think this is a think worth mentioning in the FAQ.

One last thing i am wondering about is the special effect that the title
bars get when you style them as "sticky" in fvwm 2.0 - a "MACiotic" effect
with horizontal lines (try making a window sticky, if you haven't seen it
folks, it's really nice). Is there any way of getting this effect on
non-sticky windows, too? This migh be a FAQ thing too.

Well, Chuck, keep on the good work, and Nation, thanks for what's done!

Sincerly
Ludvig A. Norin

Heya,

I noticed that the title bar in fvwm doesn't change when the title parameter
changes.

I use bash and send escape sequences to xterm via $PS1 to echo my pwd onto
the titlebar of the xterm, and it isn't updating now with the latest fvwm.

btw, I'm using fvwm pre-2.0 patchlevel 34.

It worked with fvwm pre-2.0 patchlevel 25 (I installed that on Jul 12)

Is there a setting to flip that'll do it for me?

I've just subscribed to the mailing list, but haven't heard any response back
from majordomo yet, so please at least cc: replies to windsor@synopsys.com

Thanks.

NOte, I am willing to believe that the following might show my
cluelessness. I am currently using fvwm 1.24r. If there is someway to
accomplish the following, even with just an upgrade to the beta 2.0,
please let me know.

***Control over the icon pixmap vs. the 'icon text' the floats under
the icon pixmap (or is the sole piece of the icon when there is no
pixmap):
	I'm really picky on space, and for programs like cm the icon
pixmap is sufficient and I don't want the icon text to even
appear. For most other things, I don't want there to be any icon
pixmap, just the icon text (trying to give a small 'invisible' pixmap,
just results in the icon text being as small in width as the pixmap).




***Ability to make a key equivalent to a certain mouse click:
	I've got in the habit of using the keyboard to move my mouse
pointer around, but in some cases, this is useless unless I can click.




***Ability to use a double-click when the second click is held down:
	I currently use the following setup, which allows me to click
and release to get a menu, as well as click and hold to get a menu,
but I can't double-click and hold to get the other menu.

Popup "Mouse1Popups"
	Popup		"Click"			FVWM_control
	Popup		"Motion"		FVWM_control
	Popup		"DoubleClick"		screen_locks	
EndFunction



***Better control of moving and resizing from commands:
	What I mean here are things I can link to the click of a
button, like Maximize. But I hate the way maximize set the position to
0 0. Is there any way give a window a size or position?




***Ability to change the button pixmaps
	I have a feeling I just don't know what to do on this.




***Ability to set the pointer inner and outer color.
	Am I missing something?




***Have a StartsOnPage like StartsOnDesk



***Question, why do commands like iconify and delete not wait for a
window if you set them to a mouse-click in the root window? I
currently use the following, which works, but I was just curious:

Function "Iconify"
	Iconify		"Click"
EndFunction

Mouse 0		AT142	MS	Function "Iconify"





That's all I can remember---

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92
content-length: 1739

I'd like to suggest that the way a click is distinguished from a
click-and-drag (motion) be changed for the ``official release''.

The way it's handled now is that if the ButtonPress and ButtonRelease
events occur within ClickTime milliseconds, it's considered a Click.
If it's longer, then the click ``times out'' and it becomes a Motion.
This is often not the desired behavior, especially if you're not used
to it (I've gotten complaints from people who are more used to mwm and
4Dwm).

What these people are expecting (and what I expect, whenever I
actually do use the mouse) is for the click to become a motion only
after the mouse has started to move.  That is, if I hold down the
click for fifteen seconds (having a ClickTime of 150) but don't move
the mouse at all, it should still register as a click.  Not until I
move the mouse (perhaps MotionThreshold pixels) does it become a
motion (this is already there, with a hardcoded threshold of 3
pixels).

Thus a Motion would become a Click with a timeout dependent on mouse
movement, not time (which seems funny to me).  ClickTime probably
should be reserved for the maximum amount of time between clicks of a
DoubleClick.

If anyone can explain to me the rationale behind the current use of
ClickTime, I'd appreciate it.  I was around when the discussion was
taking place, but I don't remember the arguments.

Thanks,
Danek

PS  Why does it take two keypresses to activate a menu item if the
menu was brought up by a keystroke?  I've pretty much gotten used to
it, but I'm not sure that it makes sense to me.     Danek

It shouldn't! (It doesn't on my Solaris version (pre-2.0-p33) - running on
various Sun Sparc and Classic machines)

btw, is patch-35 stable yet? or should I wait for p36 or v2.0 ("official")

I have mentioned this before, but my wish for fvwm is to have the
DEFAULT config file split into sections, to make it easier for
individual users to change things like style without having to copy the
entire .fvwmrc file. This would make it easier for novice users to debug
faults in their configuration.

Another advantage to this system, would be that it would allow modules
to be written easily by different people, that could change the
configuration of fvwm, in keeping with the modular structure of fvwm.
I reckon that most users already split their files and use M4 or CPP to
sort their files, but this takes a bit of knowledge, so setting it as
standard would help newbies.
For those who already like the one file config, the -f option would
allow them to continue as normal.

I propose a system fvwm directory with

Style
mouse
module
function
popup
etc files

and a home fvwm directory as defaults

the user would then be free to only edit those files as needed and would
save system's admin and fvwm mail lists a lot of hassel.
lots of people do this in practice, I ask that it becomes standard.

RTFM.  From the GoodStuff/FvwmButtons man page:

         If command is an fvwm Exec command, then the button
         will remain pushed in until a window whose name or
         class matches the qouted portion of the command is
         encountered. This is intended to provide visual
         feedback to the user that the action he has requested
         will be performed. If the qouted portion contains no
         characters, then the button will pop out immediately.
         Note that users can continue pressing the button, and
         re-executing the command, even when it looks "pressed
         in."

I'm not certain I understand what you are asking here.  The desktop
size can only be multiples of the the physical screen size.  Try
reading the fvwm man page to figure out how to get the behavior you
want, whatever it may be.  Look in the sections covering DeskTopSize,
EdgeResistance, and EdgeScroll.

I think this is a neat idea, as I can't see anything bad about this other than
we have to edit multiple files instead of getting lost looking through one huge
file...

One thing that I think would be an added touch of 'usefulness' would be for
.fvwm to possibly 'stat' files periodically, and if their date has changed
since it last read the file(s), it would re-read them in?

Maybe this is not a good idea, for I haven't taken the time to understand
exactly what M4 or CPP pre-processing is for, but at any rate it's a suggestion
on the table...

While I'm on the subject, is there any particular reason why fvwm must literally
exit and re-run itself to 'restart'?  I mean the program is already in memory,
why waste initialization time when you could potentially just re-run whatever
routine initially parses the .fvwmrc file....not having browsed the source this
also might be a bad idea, but then again...it's an idea...use it as you wish..

Actually, it never left, just altered slightly:

  MWMBorders

FVWM 2.xx
  Style "*" MWMBorder

Ludvig> I've checked the manpages, the FAQ, ChangeLog and the fvwmrc

I believe that it was intentionally permanently removed, since it eats
a fair amount of system resources to do that, unless you have a really
fast server & video card.  I'll add it to the FAQ.

The 'include' command in 1.xx was actually due to the m4 processing
which could be optionally compiled in (on by default, I believe).
This should probably be added to the FAQ as well.  If you use the
FvwmM4 module to read in your .fvwm2rc file, this functionalitly would
return, I believe.

Not possible to do on non-sticky windows, at least not yet.  Added it
to the FAQ.

Along these lines, I have to admit that I was rather partial to the
sticky window having a different std color in 1.xx, but Rob changed
the way it was done due to it being difficult to do in the code
cleanly.  I'd like to find a way to revive that, and if I happen to
find a clean way to make it all more generic, perhaps we can get the
title bar lines to be a more generic attribute as well.  No guarantees
though.

I'll try...

I certainly wouldn't expect it to.  But it does on my Linux box (XFree
3.1.2) and does under both IRIX 4.0 and IRIX 5.3.  I'll have to try
again on a Sun.

I now wish I'd mentioned this when I first noticed it.  I can't
remember when it first started happening, though my guess would be
somewhere around p10-20 (it is a version 2 thing, I'm sure).

BTW, why are all subjects prefixed with `FVWM:'?

I think you can use the Style settings to enable autoraise on a
per-window basis. This has been discussed here some time ago.

Hello All,

I would first like to thank Robert for all the work that he 
has put in.  We all appreciate it very much.  Secondly, I thank you
Chuck for all the work that you are about to do :-)

Other matters:

Some time ago somebody posted up a pointer to a program that could
supposedly compress the colours used in a number of XPM's.  Since I am
running out of colours, could somebody please point me to it?

Does anybody think that fvwm (.33) has a colour leak?

Thanks again.

Jon

The beta 2.0 is just about ready to be officially released, and a lot
of these things behave better or are easier to implement under it, so
you might want to upgrade.  BTW - The official (non beta) 2.0 should
be ready within the next few weeks.

Check out the man page where it describes the 'Style' command,

Hhhmmm.... I don't think that there is any way to do this currently in
either 1.xx or 2.xx.  Since the cursor can be moved from keystrokes
through fvwm, it seems to hold that you should be able to simulate a
button press as well...  I'll look into how hard it would be to add
this feature to 2.xx.

I think that something like this will work in 2.xx, but I've never
tried it...  Nope - a quick test shows that it doesn't work there
either.  I'll take a look and see if this is a bug or working as
designed and how easily fixed/implemented.

This can be done in 2.xx easier, I believe.

You mean title bar buttons?  They can be redesigned via the
ButtonStyle command, but you can't specify arbitrary bitmaps or
pixmaps (yet).  This might be added later.

Scott> ***Ability to set the pointer inner and outer color.
Scott>  Am I missing something?

I don't think that this can be specified, currently.

Scott> ***Have a StartsOnPage like StartsOnDesk

Just use the geometry specs to do this -> just add multiples of the
screen width & height.  It's the only way to do it right now.

In 2.xx, Just 'Mouse 1 R N Iconify' more or less works by iconifying
the window that you RELEASE over.  I think it behaved the same in
1.xx, but I'm not sure.

Hope I've been of assistance.

Somewhere between 1.24r and pre-2pl35 the DeskTopScale parameter disappeared
from fvwm.  The following patch (against pre-2pl35) reimpliments it as a
control parameter for FvwmPager itself.  The specification in the .fvwm2rc
file is as so:

*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35 

(or whatever scale factor anyone wants)

It is not right. OpaqueMoveSize in fvwm-2 is equivalent to OpaqueMove
in fvwm-1.

Here is a list of fvwm-1 and fvwm-2 features equivalence list. I think
it may have some error (because I made this list when pre2.0p1? ...).

I have noticed that when i try pre-2.0-33 and do a ftp from netscape 1.1N, 
netscape dies. I can't find any core files. As the importance netscape has
these days this may be a bad thing for fvwm.

It works with no problems when using 1.24r

Environment: Solaris 2.4, gcc 2.6.3, fvwm-2.0-pre-33

I have the same behaviour.  Netscape dumps core quite often with fvwm :-(

I have tried to do some trussing to find out what is going on, but have
thus far failed.  Same environment.

I tried running netscape with private colour maps, thinking that this might
be the cause, but it exhibits the same behaviour.

I discussed this in great detail with Rob, maybe a year or two back, and we
decided that it's not really feasible, for a number of reasons:

a) which window gets the click?
b) many programs ignore simulated events - which a key-press mouse binding
   would produce.
c) it's too complicated (or that's the impression I got) ;-)

Having said that, if you, Chuck, can find a way, I would be _very_ interested
in seeing it in 2.xx!! (I move the mouse pointer by key-presses alot too!)

Tara,
Ben.

 I have a similar question. I read that in the X-window FAQ :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  20)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced
when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful for
moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does
not do "macro expansion."
[deleted text]
	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special "remapper" client been made available.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

does fvwm 2.0 does it ?

I have the same environment: Solaris 2.4, gcc 2.6.3, fvwm-2.0-pre-33,
running on any of Sun Sparc 5/10/20 and I _don't_ get this problem - I use
Netscape 1.0 - maybe it's Netscape 1.1 that has the problem :-)

I'm trying Netscape 1.1 just now on an ftp site, and I've not had any
problems yet - what action causes Netscape 1.1 to die?

I don't think so, but I have seen pretty much all of my colours get
eaten from time to time.  I suspected other programs, but it might be
something in fvwm.  I'll keep my eyes open for it...

I don't think so.  I'm looking at the source right now and see nothing
for that.  The discussions were a wish list item then as well, I
believe.

I found this little program 'xcolormap' that shows the colormap, and I
added some code to it that if you click on it w/ button 1, it puts the
number of free colors in the title.  It's pretty handy for this sort
of thing.  I've included it below, and I copied the fvwm list in case
anyone else wants it.

This would be a good idea. Though displays that require this are getting
less common 'round here, they're still there - especially on people's
personal desktop machines. :-(

Ah, the joys of 24-bit colour (Sun Sparc 5) workstation displays! ;-)

Could someone please send me the man pages for fvwm and the modules in
ascii text? Or, if there are any perl scripts that convert these man pages to
the standard man page format, that would be fine too.

On my system, we did not install troff/groff. We are scarmbling
for disk space.

Thank you.

You should use a local lockfile on the last sub-recipe by suffixing the
:0 with a second ':'.

BTW, the recipe I use is a little smaller and faster:

    :0
    *       ^TOfvwm
    {
	    :0Dfhw
	    *       ^Subject: (Re: )?FVWM:
		    | sed -e '/^Subject:/ s/FVWM: //'
	    :0:
		    fvwm
    }

(Of course, I'm not filtering out owner-fvwm.)

Hi Chuck,

Thanks for the modified xcolormap.  It works like a charm except for when
the colourmap is about full, at which time it dumps with the message:

X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  86 (X_AllocColorCells)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  5520
  Current serial number in output stream:  5520

when one pushes the left mouse button.

Using this program, I was able to track down my colour leaks though.
After startup I have about 203 colours free.  Instantiating netscape
I have about 130 free.  Destroying netscape restores my count to 203. The
same happens for various other programs.  Ghostview, xview etc. etc.
I can run a program, and after exit my colourmap is back to 203. 

BUT, this does not happen with the latest release of xdvi.  After I 
run it, and exit, the colourmap program reports about 120 colours free.
And they don't come back.

My question is then this:

[1]  Whose responsibility is it to retrieve those colours? 
 			ie.
[2]  Is it xdvi's fault, or fvwm's fault?

Jon

You can however map keys to strings within an xterm by setting up keymap
translations in your Xresource (or Xdefaults) file (handy for function key
shortcuts).
>From the Xterm manpage;

     Below is a sample how of the keymap() action is used to  add
     special keys for entering commonly-typed works:

         *VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
         *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
              <Key>F14: keymap(None) \n\
              <Key>F17: string("next") string(0x0d) \n\
              <Key>F18: string("step") string(0x0d) \n\
              <Key>F19: string("continue") string(0x0d) \n\
              <Key>F20: string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)

Cool, that covers half of what I want, but I think I want a new set of
styles 'IconPixmap/NoIconPixmap' so that I can choose to just show the
Icon Title w/o any attached pixmap:
	Style "*"	IconTitle, NoIconPixmap

You got my confidence up enough to look at my 1.24r code; and I got it
to work they way I want with this patch:

Without the IsClick(...) line, it is faster than the release of the
second-click, a sleep could be used, but I think that using IsClick
might also do some nice handling of quick movement after a
double-click (with a hold on the second click)----

I'm not sure if it was intentionally coded the other way before, but
it appeared to drop the case where I double click with a hold on the
second click.....

Very much so, I recommend you get a raise!!!

of beta's, I just don't want to make two updates in two weeks). Just
don't announce that you've decided it will be FVWM '96. ;-)

Hi,

I'm not sure there's an elegant solution, but I'll at least point out the
"problem"  =b... if I start fvwm with some options, for instance

	fvwm -f "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

then fvwm starts up fine.  But if I want to (for whatever crazy reason)
switch to another window manager, I usually put

	Restart twm

in my window manager and bind it to a menu item, for instance.  When I
select the function, though, I get:

twm:  unable to open twmrc file FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc, using /usr/X11R5/sun4/lib/X11/twm/system.twmrc instead

which of course is a "bad thing."  Perhaps line options should only be
passed to the restarted window manager if its executable name is the same
as the one under which the original window manager is started or something?

I have 2 things to propose for fvwm.
1. would it be possible to make the window-titles selectable?
This is a feature of gwm. I miss it especially when I have the path of an xterm
window in the title, or while configuring the fvwmrc.
2. Sometimes I start a program, and it takes several seconds to open the
window. If I want the window to open on a particular desktop, I wait there,
till the window comes up. Could it be possible to leave 'markers' on desktops
saying 'I want the next window to open here' ?

Hello,

I'm having a problem with xterms opening up behind anything else that
happens to be on the desktop.  They aren't necessarily the "last thing in
the pile", but they aren't on top, either.

xemacs does it as well, but Netscape doesn't.

This appears to be the same problem that was fixed in the 1.24 days:

l to m
       1. Fixed a problem where de-iconified windows don't always
          end up on top.

FYI:  I'm running NetBSD/sparc on a Sparc 2, with X11R6 (no idea on the pl).

I've installed 2.0.35 and it looks good so far. Other than getting it to
install in a $LIB/fvwm2 directory, which I ended up doing by hand, and
the conversion of my old rc file to the new format, I had no problems
with Linux and XFree 3.12.

I've got one problem though that I'm still stuck on, and a couple of
ideas for the 2.0 suggestion box.

First, the problem, mapping to a key that doesn't have a name. A long
time ago on this list, someone mentioned they'd mapped the cntrl-grey
insert-home-pg.up block of keys to GotoPage commands for a 2x6 pager. I
liked this idea, because those keys are easy to reach with your thumb on
the control key for fast window changes. However, I remap the delete key
to ^D with Xmodmap keycode 107 = 0x04.  Unfortunately, this seems to
leave me with no name to map the delete key with, and fvwem won't map to
the keycode number. Any suggestions?

As far as suggestions go, two things I'd like to see in fvwm would be:

First. a per page strategy for window placement. Currently , I use
SmartPlacement and RandomPlacement. This works fine with the first few
windows I open, which are tiled to the NW gravity point. Then, if I goto
a different page, the first window is placed in the open NW corner, but
subsequent windows are opened at random, as fvwm seems to think it's
exausted the tiling space, even though the new page in the pager only
has one window open. Turning off RandomPlacement just means I have to
hand place every window after the first one open, which I'd like to
avoid. Maybe a TiledPlacement keyword would be appropriate. As well, it
would be nice to be able to define the space left between windows when
they tile. Currently, I find the windows are tiled a bit tightly, and I
end up adjusting them by hand.

Second, an alternate drawing strategy for FvwmPager. Maybe this is a
bug, but I discovered I can swallow FvwmPager 0 0 and have a 6x2 pager
showing in FvwmButtons, but I can use Desk 0 1, Desk 0 2, etc to jump to
new desktops and open windows. But, they don't show up in the pager
window, which continues to show Desk 0 0. I think it would be quite
useful to exploit this, to avoid the pager window gobbling extra space
on my desk, by having FvwmPager be able to map the active desk into the
same window.

I see fvwm 2 now allows xlock -mode swirl to work properly, which was a
pleasant surprise.

While, for the time being, fvwm@wonderland.org is simply an alias for
fvwm@hpc.uh.edu it is strongly preferred that you not send mail meant for
the FVWM mailing list there.  Wonderland is behind some convoluted and
flaky mail plumbing and there are significant delays in crossing the ocean
to get from there to hpc.uh.edu (in Houston, Texas, USA).  Yes,
wonderland.org is in Britain.  More annoying is the fact that I get all of
the bounces sent to the wonderland list owners which usually includes some
delay messages in sending the messages back across the pond.

Interesting...  Non trivial to add, but interesting.  Perhaps easier
would be a small module that puts the window (Name, IconName, Class,
Resource, or any other info from FvwmIdent, depending on a parameter
to it) into the X selection buffer?  That would probably be much
easier, and could be added to your window options menu.

Perhaps, but what if the next window to open isn't the one you
expected?  BTW - take a look at the fvwm man page where it talks about
this:

          Some applications, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user
          to specify the start-up desk on the command line:

               xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"

          will start an xterm on desk number 1. Not all applications
          understand this option, however.

That may help you.

Actually, if you just don't specify an Icon, and it (the app) doesn't
have a built in one, then it should only come up w/ the title.  But
perhaps another style option that inhibits even built in icons (as you
suggest) would be a good idea.  It'll have to wait until the Style
flags overhaul though, which will be my first big change after the
first official release.

Well, I'll check out that patch and see if it adversely effects
anything else.  It does change the behavior to happen on the press
instead of the release though, which was talked about a long time ago.
I believe MWM does a lot on the press as well.

What problems did you have installing it?  If it was the man pages not

Yeah - don't use xmodmap to change that key.  Instead use the
individual apps (like XTerm) X resources to change it.

A tiled placement option probably isn't a bad idea, but I think that a
window moving module (FvwmTile) would be cooler.  You could invoke it
at any time to retile a set of windows (based on name, class, or
whatever) on the current page and you could set the parameters like
direction & spacing.  I'll add it to the TO-DO list.

By the way, if anyone wants too, feel free to take a crack at anything
on the TO-DO list.  As I've stated in the past, my spare time to work
on this is limited and any help is appreciated.

John> Second, an alternate drawing strategy for FvwmPager. Maybe this is a

Actually, it already does this when it's iconified.  The icon is the
pager for the current desk.  But, I think that the non iconified
single desk pager should have an option to do this as well.  Now on
the TO-DO list.

And it looks real pretty too...

Hello,

I just recently subscribed to this list, so please forgive me if these 
questions have already been asked ad nauseam.  I just upgraded to version 
2.0.27 (I think).  Anyway, I converted my .fvwmrc (version 1.24) to the 
new format (using a script provided by Martin Kraemer and Grant McDorman) 
and things went fairly well with a couple small exceptions.  

1.  my FvwmButtons (formerly GoodStuff) and some menu items no longer 
launch things like they did in version 1.24.  When I hit a button defined 
as follows in my .fvwmrc

*FvwmButtons XEmacs emacs.xpm Exec "" (cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &)

I get the following error:  

/bin/sh: syntax error near unexpected token `(cd'
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: `"" (cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs & )

This used to work no problem.  A similarly defined menu item also has 
problems:

AddToMenu "Editors" "Text..." Title
+              "Xemacs" Exec exec "(cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &)" 

results in 

exec: /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm-2.0/fvwm/(cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &): 
cannot execute: No such file or directory

Why does the path get prepended to the command?  Is that a flag in a 
Makefile or configure file that I screwed up somewhere?  

2.  Whenever I restart FVWM (this happened with version 1.24 as well) I get 
the following X error:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x2800003
  Serial number of failed request:  157
  Current serial number in output stream:  158

the serial numbers change (though are sometimes the same two or three 
times in a row) but the other stuff is the same.  I have no idea what 
window could be causing this.  

3.  Finally, is there any way to get icons to align themselves on their
text (ie not on the pixmaps)?  I have pixmaps of slightly varying sizes,
and they end up being all over the place as they appear to be aligned on
their top edge. 

That's all for now...  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.  
Cheers,

Dave

This looks like a bug. I have a similar line

*FvwmButtons Rossby xterm2.xbm Exec "rossby" rxx rossby -n rossby &

that works fine in pl35. rxx is a perl script, but it appears fvwm is
trying to pass your line to /bin/sh and munging it by picking up the
"" as part of the shell command line. Anyway, upgrading (if you really
are at pl27) might fix things.

This looks like fvwm is searching for a module to launch.

This, I'm almost positive (Chuck?) is caused by a bug in XEmacs-19.13,
and not at all fvwm's fault. Do you still see it when XEmacs is not

Don't know.

This is most likely because you're swallowing windows into FvwmButtons,
which aren't getting "deleted" properly when fvwm is killed and restarted.
Chuck, this doesn't seem like "nice" behavior -- that is, if I "delete" the
FvwmButtons window, it doesn't happen; only when I restart/exit fvwm do I
get this error.  Ideas?

Try removing the quotes "". 

*FvwmButtons XEmacs emacs.xpm Exec (cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &)

In fvwm 1.24r, the quotes indicate that the button should be popped back out
without waiting for a window with a specific class/name to appear but
this seems to have changed in pre 2.0.

In this case, try removing the quotes and the second exec.

AddToMenu "Editors" "Text..." Title
+              "Xemacs" Exec (cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &)

According to the code, fvwm does an execvp of /bin/sh passing -c
as the first argument to sh and whatever follows Exec as the second argument
to sh and that explains this behavior.

Try typing /bin/sh -c 'exec "(cd /usr/khoros/res/tg; xemacs &)"' at your
shell prompt to reproduce the problem.

I know it and I use it. But I want that sort of things to work with
all X-clients. I like to have Ctrl-left to generate Esc-b which do in
genral backward-word function.

For xterm, I use translation but I want to do it with more clients.

I think it would be a good thing to have at least two level :

  - application preferences with translations as I do with xterm

  - global preferences at window manager level

thanks for your answer.

Pascal


ps : do you know where I can have some informations about
     translations. I do some things with the exemple in the xterm man
     page but I wasn't able to find a complete explanation of the
     syntax of translations.

In short I disagree. Apart from already having over 100 "dot" files in my home
directory I think that breaking up the configuration file(s) is a bad idea.

I think it may be a better approach to allow the use of a common system config
file (eg /usr/local/lib/fvwm/fvwmrc). This file would be read in as a precursor
to any users' .fvwmrc file.

I dont think having more files and increasing the complexity will help
newbies. I think the biggest way to help them is to improve the documentation.

I agree too.  It's very easy for local installers to set up something
like this if they want, but I don't think it would be a good idea to
break it up by default.

Fvwm will already do that now, basically.  You could just tell users
to name their .fvwmrc files something like .fvwmrc-local, and make the
system one be .fvwmrc, which fvwm would read in and it could Read (or
FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp) .fvwmrc-local.

I agree here wholeheartedly.  That and supplying (or pointing to the
sites that have) all of those sample config files.

I'm new to fvwm, so new that I'm not using it yet because I can't get it to
work properly.

I compiled pl34 the other day and today I found out about pl35 and compiled
and installed it, replacing pl34. I should have tried it first. I had
problems with pl34, but at least it was reading my .fvwmrc. pl35 just brings
up windows with grey borders and no buttons and I can't even get a menu. I
had to quit by killing the process. And that was hard because I couldn't
bring a window to the front and see all of it. 

Incidentally, both versions compiled just fine except for needing to have
lots of work done to all the Makefiles, which was a pain.

So, the following problems I've experienced were happening in pl34. I don't
know if they happen with pl35.

1. Whenever I use a module (for example, FvwmIdent), I can't do anything to
   it (besides move it) without all of fvwm getting killed. I can't click in
   the window or close it or destroy it. Basically, I just have to let it
   stay there.

2. On a related note, other things, when exited will sometimes crash fvwm. I
   I haven't experimented enough to see what doesn't cause a crash, but most
   things do.

3. When I start up X, I have two things that start iconified: the console
   window, and my calendar program. I want these two icons in particular
   places: the console icon in the top left corner, and the calendar icon
   just to the right of it. The calendar program has a switch that tells it
   where to put the icon. But with fvwm, the icon always ends up in the same
   place as the console icon. If I click on it, sometimes it will move to
   where it's supposed to be. I've tried giving it it's own IconBox
   definition, but that doesn't help. How can I put it exactly where I want
   it?

4. It would be great if I could have fvwm tell me what it's doing or send
   errors to a file. I was experimenting with Wait and it seemed like the
   window it was supposed to wait for was up and it was still waiting, but I
   couldn't tell what was going on. This may be what FvwmDebug is for, but 
   that didn't come with the package. 

Please help!

Thanks.

The changes had to do with MANPATH not being set the way I wanted it,
XPMINCLUDE not being used, and my not setting FVWMDIR properly.

I'm using Solaris 2.4, my compiler is "/usr/local/SUNWspro/SC3.0/bin/cc".
make is "/usr/ccs/bin/make" (I know pathnames aren't usually helpful, but
that's the best I can do). I'm using OpenWin. I already mentioned what I had
to do to the Makefiles. My .xinitrc does properly invoke fvwm. If it didn't,
I wouldn't have been able to use pl34. fvwm did install in the right place.

I use xinit, but it should work the same. I'll try it next time.

humm...
didn't the original idea include the suggestion that these multiple-segment
.fvwmrc "files" be put in a "hidden" subdirectory?  like ~/.fvwm/ perhaps?

Elm (the mail reader) already does this.  And I sorta like the idea.  At
first I thought it was a little strange, I suppose because it was the first
"tool" I'd ever used that took that approach. 

But after I got used to it, I really liked it.  It keeps the number of dot
files in the home directory down (I agree that we all seem to wind up with
too many!) and in Elm's case, it provided a place to store away alias 
text and database files needed by some of the features of the tool.

Perhaps fvwm could benefit down the road with having a "place of its own"
to put who-knows-what-have-you stuff that might be needed for future
enhancements/features. 

just another man's $.02 worth (maybe less) ;-)

Last week I submitted a message to the list describing a problem with
pl35 and FvwmM4. Arguments meant for FvwmM4 were, for some reason,
passing to fvwm itself. Even simple lines like

    fvwm -f "FvwmM4 .fvwmrc"

weren't working correctly. In the above example, I'd get an error
stating that ".fvwmrc" wasn't an option to fvwm.

Well folks, I feel pretty silly. I've learned yet again how Unix can
give you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot. (Sorry for the
tortured analogy there...)

I run on multiple architectures -- Sun (mostly), SGI, and HP. To make
things easier for me, most of the files in my binary directories are
actually hardlinks to a shell script that figures out what
architecture I'm on, selects the appropriate directory of binaries,
and executes the chosen binary.

One of the Korn shell's more obscure quoting mechanisms is at the
heart of what tripped me up last week. The last line of my execution
script looks something like this:

    exec $BINDIR/$ARCHDIR/$PROGRAM $@

By using $@ , any command-line arguments I pass to the script go on
to the real program.

But! Here's the catch. That line should really look like this:

    exec $BINDIR/$ARCHDIR/$PROGRAM "$@"

Those double-quote marks around $@ made all the difference. The
reason: without the double quotes, command-line arguments are combined
and passed along as a single string. If "$@" is used, command-line
arguments are kept separate from each other.

So, it's no surprise fvwm was complaining about the command-line args.
It was getting exactly what I gave it! (grrr..)

Now that that's fixed, I'm running both pl35 *and* FvwmM4 with no
problems. Thanks to everyone for their help.

(For those interested in the details of my little goof-up, e-mail me
directly and I'll give you the scoop. Since my real problem was more
related to shell programming than Fvwm, I feel it's outside the scope of
the list.)

Hello FVWM users,

I'm not sure how many guys are interested in this, 
but I'd like to release the fvwm localization patch for supporting
multibyte characters, mainly Japanese kanji characters.
This patch enables to use/draw multibyte characters in menu, window
title and icon title, etc.

This patch must be applied in fvwm-pre-2.0-patchlevel-35 source tree.
I've only tested on SunOS 4.1.3/X11R6 with Japanese locale and fonts.
I think some modifications may be needed for other OS/platforms or
languages. (or some extra fonts ?)
You should set appropriate locale before executing fvwm2.
Also you should use font set for font assignment in your .fvwm2rc file.
(Sample: fvwm/sample.fvwmrc/kanji.fvwmrc)
Please refer to XCreateFontSet(3X11) man page for locale and font set.

I attached gzipped and uuencoded patch at the end of this mail.
(verrrry sorry for long mail)
Please 'uudecode' and 'gunzip' this then 'patch'.

Any comments are appreciated.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.92

Hello all,
    I am currently using fvwm 1.24l (I believe) and aim to upgrade to
fvwm 2.0 as soon as I get to my new job in two weeks time.  However, in the
meantime, I have a few suggestions for improvements over 1.24 that could
perhaps go into 2.0 or later.  Maybe these have already been covered - it's
difficult to tell without actually installing 2.0, and having only recently
joined the mailing list.

  1) The ability to add and delete desktops without restarting fvwm.  I
     currently use two desktops with just one page on each (ie. no scrolling).
     I use the first desktop (named "Main") as a general desktop, and the
     second (named "Net") as a surfing desktop which xrn, Mosaic, xftp, etc.
     are configured to start on.
     However, I found yesterday, that I had already filled "Main" and "Net"
     with windows, and I wanted to start another "task" which would ideally
     use a new desktop...  See the problem ?  In the end I resorted to
     iconifying all the windows on "Main" to make space for the new work I
     wanted to do.

  2) The system menu of my windows include items such as Iconify and
     (Un)Stick.  I believe these were predefined in the sample
     system.fvwmrc.  I would like these menu items to perform in the same
     way as in mwm, ie. Iconify (aka Minimize) would be greyed out once the
     window is iconified.  In the same vein, we could then have a Restore,
     as mwm has which would be greyed out when the window is already
     restored, but would be active when the window is iconified or maximised
     in any way.
     A slighty different approach might be applied to (Un)Stick seeing as it
     is a two-state option, rather than the three-or-more-state option which
     minimize/restore/maximize/etc. is.  In this case, the text of the
     option might change - ie. if the window is "stuck", the option might
     say "Unstick", and if it is "free", the option might say "Stick"...

  3) Programs that use the Motif system of adding menu items to the system
     menu of the window do not work.  A Motif program can also then activate
     and deactivate those menu items using the WM_PROTOCOLS atom.

  4) The IconBox functionality in 1.24 seems to line up icons on their
     top-left corner.  If the icons are different sizes and shapes this
     looks very ragged.  I'm not sure however what a better strategy would
     be, other than my next suggestion for an enhancement...

  5) Add an option to the IconBox functionality that applies gridding to the
     icons based on the size of them.  This allows the user to easily drag
     icons around and have them line up nicely.  Perhaps the first step
     would be to just set a grid size in pixels, rather than base it on the
     size of the icons themselves.  I guess mwm kind of cheats here by
     forcing all icons to be the same size - it makes gridding rather easy.
     If this is added, then the following could be an enhancement to it:

      o Force no more than one icon to a grid position - thus if the user
        drops an icon into a grid position that is already occupied, it is
        dropped instead into the nearest empty grid position.

  6) Another nice feature would be to allow icon names to stay expanded
     whilst they do not have focus.

Any comments anyone ?  If I get a chance in my new job, and some of these
haven't been added, I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty.    ;-)


BTW, thanks Rob and Chuck for your commitment.

Cheers,
  Jonathan.

Umm... We fvwm-users-in-japan mailing list have already developed
these feature (fvwm internationalization) and released (with documents
including japanese-translated-manual and supplementals) as
fvwm-users-jp-kits.

(Our approach is just like your approach, i.e., using X11's I18N feature.)

If you have interested in, you can ftp to get. Be aware that all
documentation is written in JAPANESE. The latest release, named
fvwm-users-jp-kits.95Sep09.tar.gz, is available from followings:

<URL:ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/fvwm/jp/fvwm-users-jp-kits.95Sep09.tar.gz>
<URL:ftp://wsclark.huie.hokudai.ac.jp/pub/X11/contrib/ima/fvwm-users-jp-kits.95Sep09.tar.gz>
<URL:ftp://ftp.astec.co.jp/pub/X11/contrib/fvwm/fvwm-pre-2.0/fvwm-users-jp-kits.95Sep09.tar.gz>

or whereever its mirror. Sorry official fvwm-users-jp-kits archive is
temporary closed so above are all COPY of official...

You can already do this, though it's an undocumented feature. Just
assign some keys or a menu  to Desk 0 2 and Desk 0 3, etc, for the number of
desktops you want in reserve, and you can call them up at the press of a
key. They won't show up in the pager window though, unless you iconize
the pager.

I believe that one of the original suggestions had that, yes.
Regardless, I still don't think that the default should be changed to
this.

All (most?) other window managers have one rc file, and I don't want
to break that tradition just yet.  Fvwm is already powerful enough to
provide this multiple rc file functionalilty if you want, but I don't
think that it should be the default.

Now, if someone out there wanted to provide a sample system.fvmwrc
file to be included that helps facilitate this by reading multiple
local files, along w/ a README about it, I'd be happy to include it in
the sample.fvwmrc directory so everyone that installs it knows that
option is available.  Perhaps I'll take a stab at making one this
weekend, but since I don't split up my rc file, perhaps I'm not the
best one to provide this.

	I definately agree with this. Having been forced to use both
HP's VUE and IBM's PowerDesktop (both very similar.. part of some
idea called the Common Desktop Environment or some such nonsense)
I know how much of a pain in the ass it is to look for things in
multiple multiple files. They have an entire heirarchy of directories
and files to put stuff.
	The only redeeming quality is an x client that allows you to
set a lot of the commonly modified aspects. Changing menus or keybindings,
however, is No Fun.

	But at the same time, having split files, if there are only
two or three and not thirty, could work. I like the idea, but the
particular execution has to be done very carefully.

It's easy. Just put in your .fvwmrc (or .fvwm2rc) file:

Read .fvwm-styles
Read .fvwm-menus
Read .fvwm-keys
Read .fvwm-modules

and so on. You can even nest the structure, as far as you keep all the
files into your home directory. Perhaps this feature could be added in
the FAQ, or in the manual page.

BTW, many thanks to Rob for this wonderful window manager. I just expect
that fvwm won't evolve into creeping featurism. IMHO, the best strength
of fvwm is its modular design and the capability of running well on all
kind of machines, even on limited ones (scarce memory, etc.).

You are looking for something to organize a .fvwmrc.
I suggest to have a look at "dotfile", I think, it is worth it.
You can get information @ http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/

BTW, thanks to all the guys and girls who build this easy-to-handle powerful
window-manger! It is important to me, because I'm new with unix and X.

Been there (on the Apollo/HP Vue crap)  and it _is_ a pain; e.g., to
change simple things - like when "providers" of the common environment 
implement things like font choices for xterms in a bizillion different places
instead of using the xresources database settings, and you're like me and 
can't read the damn (small) fonts without getting the bifocals (yes, I'm 
_that_ old, folks) focused on the screen!

I recompiled pl35 and it works! I didn't really do anything significantly
differently, so I don't know what fixed it.

Also, I tried FvwmIdent and it didn't crash!

I still have the problem with that icon not starting where it's supposed to,
though. As I said in my previous message, though, it moves to where it's
supposed to be when I click on it.

This has got to be a simple problem. I get the following error on my
Sparc 5, running SunOs 4.1.4, gcc version 2.6.3

ld: Undefined symbol 
   _sqrt 
   _floor 
collect2: ld returned 2 exit status


My gcc command is:

gcc -O -Wall -o xcolormap -DULONG_NEEDED -L/usr/lib -lm -L/local/lib -lX11
 -lXt xcolormap.c


The math library gives me this:
diemos: nm libm.a | fgrep sqrt
Fsqrt.o:
00000000 T _Fsqrt
         U _r_sqrt_
c_sqrt.o:

Everything looks OK to me, Any ideas?

Don't know if this question belongs to the mailing list -- anyone knows
what happened to the FVWM homepage that once was at 
http://www.cs.hmc.edu/people/tkelly/docs/fvwm.html? 
It's gone. Seems that the author has graduated or left his job or something.

* How about making i easy (in configure.h> to specify that another
  name should be used for ~/.fvwmrc -files? When moving from version 1
  to version 2, it would be nice to have different files without having
  to specify an -f -option.

* It would be nice to allow environment variables in eg. ModulePath,
  so one could specify /some/path/$HOSTTYPE

Sverre - happy fvwm-user, both at home and at the university.
