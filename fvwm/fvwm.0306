Happy 10th, FVWM!

I've been using FVWM on a regular basis since 1999, and I have a
screenshot from when I was using a derivative (Afterstep 1.0) back in
1997!  From time to time, I'll check out every WM I can get my hands on,
but FVWM always fits best, so I keep coming back to it.

Hope the coming celebration is fun!

Happy 10th anniversary, FVWM.  I've been using it since 1998, I think,
starting with fvwm1, through 2.0.x and 2.2.x before happily using 2.4
now.

Hope I'll be using 2.6 in not-so-long.  Keep up the great work.

I have been using fvwm since Redhat 5.0. It was 5 years ago. Since then,
I tried a lot of different WMs, but none of them was so flexible as
fvwm. In fvwm you can do absolutely everything!

Happy Birthday FVWM, the greats of window managers!

I got my first computer in 1995 (an old 386Dx40) and immediately
installed slackware linux on it via lots & lots of floppy disks as it
had no cdrom. However it was too slow to run X properly so I soon
upgraded to a 486DX33 which I had for many years. I tried a lot of
window managers on that old 486 and although a couple came close, none
were as fast nor as flexible as fvwm. I quickly discovered that the
excellent documentation allowed a complete computer illiterate such as I
to customise his desktop any way he wants.

Over the years I have tried as many other window managers as I could,
just to compare, but I never stray from fvwm for long. I flirted with
fvwm95 for awhile, then stuck with fvwm-2.0.43b for over a year, until I
started using the cvs versions. Nowadays I try to keep my installation
as up to date as I can, and I still haven't been able to try all the
possible combinations of fvwm-themes! I think they're approaching
infinity?

Anyway, I guess I'm truly addicted to fvwm as any of the regulars on
EFNET's #linuxhelp and #redhat can attest to, as I spend much time &
energy extolling the virtues of fvwm to newbies and old time linux users
alike.

CONGRATULATIONS to all the tireless and dedicated developers of the best
window manager in the known universe, on reaching such a momentous
milestone!

Hope to see you all at the party!  :)

Alex

Happy Birthday, FVWM!

I start using a computer in 1992 at the university for my thesis. It
was a UNIX system and the X terminal run twm. In 93 or 94 one day a
saw a pager and I want to have it. So I start using FVWM version 1.
In 95 I moved and I used CDE on Solaris during 3 years. In 1998, I get
a laptop and install Linux (Redhat 5.?) after a bad experience with
Afterstep I used FVWM version 2.0.46 with the redhat "fvwm95" config.
Since then I used FVWM. I send my first patch on June 1999 and become
a fvwm workers at the end of 1999.

Regards, Olivier

Just wanted to toss in my congratulations.. Been using it since '96
when I started studying at the university.. Now I admin a few of the
computer systems there and fvwm is the default window manager for its
flexibility and low resource usage. FvwmButtons is a good thing too.

Let the fun continue..

Hello,

till 2.5.6, I used the following line

Mouse 1                W       4       Move

to move windows by dragging them with left Windows key and Mouse-1. 
Since 2.4.7, behavior of the Move command changed - I have to click into 
the window, then move the window and then click again at the new 
position. How can I enable the old behavior?

Another issue are windows of Mozilla, which have their own bottom-right 
  resize corner. However, when resizing them this way, the whole window 
moves in the north-west direction and it eventually leaves the screen 
entirely. Fluxbox has this problem too but in Metacity it works allright.

Regards,

If you define a function like this:

AddToFunc MyMove M Move

and

Mouse 1                W       4       MyMove

It works as expected.

I also have a similar setup, but I haven't yet installed the newest
version as my "real" Fvwm. I have a parallell version for testing (using
Xnest)

Is this some special theme for Mozilla? I use the "classic" theme, but I
see no such corners. Or are they present only in some windows?

Congratulations on the first 10 years!

I've been using fvwm since I installed my first Linux-distribution,
Yggdrasil Linux, Fall '94.

I've tried other windowmanagers for a couple of hours from time to
time, but I've always returned quickly to fvwm; it works like I expect
it to, and I can have wide borders on all sides of my windows easily.

Here's to the next 10 years, and thanks for the first 10!

Thanks, I changed Move and Resize this way, and it works.

sorry, it was a bit misleading. these are present in the Modern theme 
(supplied with the default installation).

fvwm2 was the first window manager I used after I stumbled out of twm when I 
first started using Linux (Slackware; yay Zipslack!), and yesterday evening I 
just had an urge to try it again.  And I went to fvwm.org and wouldn't you 
know, it's party time.

Happy Birthday, FVWM!

I really enjoyed all nice messages on this list together with some
hardcore FVWM supporter voices on SlashDot. It feels very pleasing
to hear "thank you for making this world nicer" words.

But I am primary a user, so I want also to thank everyone working on
this project and supporting it.

I used X since 1993. We had Irix and other unix stations in Univercity.
I liked 4dwm. Then someone installed fvwm95 in his account (we had 5Mb
quota then, or 15Mb, depending on the account). I used it a bit, wanted
new versions, but they didn't come. Then I installed X on my home
machine and shortly discovered that fvwm95 is just a short fork of fvwm.
Then my love started. The evolution since then is clear. New features,
stable versions 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 soon (maybe this year with your help).

So, it is a nice feeling. And I wish everyone the same. You may still
enjoy the irc chat although it is getting really late for some of us. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Happy Birthday Fvwm!!!

I've been using fvwm since it was default
with redhat 5.1 and I've tried some others
for a while like WindowMaker and
AnotherLevel including desktops like CDE,
KDE, and GNOME and always come back to
fvwm.  It's a great wm with an easy config.

But recently I've been running into some
difficulties I'd like to find a way to
solve.  One is some way to cause a key
binding set in fvwm to be sent to the app
instead, (i.e. when I'm vnced to another
machine running fvwm with an identical
config).  I'd like to be able to set
vncviewer to receive certain key strokes
I've set to be global for everything like
Ctl-Alt-Arrow for moving around my large
4x4 desktop.

Also, my FvwmButtons with has my pager
in it sometimes gets hidden, not a big deal
since I can just right-click on the window
titlebar to send it to the back, but
sometimes I don't was to mess with the order
of windows like sending an xterm behind my
maximized browser and moving it would mean
moving it back again so I could see the page.

Keep up all the good work!

Hi everyone,

Recently I upgraded (actually reinstalled) two workstations from RedHat 
7.3 to 9. First thing to do afterwards was installing FVWM. The problem 
is that one machine runs just fine, the other one has a problem with 
the default RedHat mouse cursors. In 24b color mode the mouse is OK, 
but the display is _slow_. In 16b mode, the mouse leaves "traces". I 
think it has something to do with alpha (transparant) parts of the 
mousecursor bitmaps.

I know this probably isn't an FVWM problem, but does anybody know how I 
can solve this? (Google wasn't my friend)

Thanks!

Is this happening with the old 2-color bitmapped cursors that X has had
for ages, or the newer (more colorful) cursors that appeared in XFree
4.3 (which support full alpha channels.)

If it's the latter, the cursors may be slow on video cards that can't do
hardware alpha blending.  You can switch back to the older cursor style
by putting the following lines in your Xresources file:

Xcursor.theme: core
Xcursor.size: 16

Thank's to all people who wrote this good piece of software. I am using it many years, because it is faster and more flexibel then all the other WM's.

But please no messages from war lords, like the one I got from Jason L Tibbitts III [tibbs@math.uh.edu].

Hi there,

I  have  append  a  partial  fvmw-config  which  produces  a
breakable  pager  on  my system. After changing the desk the
pager gets killed. 
The problem disappears if the three commented lines are used
and the previous two are commented out. 

fvwm 2.5.7
Sun 5.8

Can anybody reproduce this?

Regards, Uwe

It's the new fancy mousepointers, on a RedHat 9 box.

I think you're right...

...so I tried this but it doesn't work (I tried /etc/X11/Xresources , 
/etc/X11/gdm/Xresources and ~/.Xdefaults). I'm not even sure if the old 
cursors are installed at all. Does anyone know how to get "core" 
cursors on a RH9 box? Thanks!

(please send bug reports to the fvwm-workers list)

I don't get a crash with your config, but the window colours are
screwed on desk 0 after switching.  Do you get a core dump?  If
so, please post a stack trace:

Congratulations! 

I first used fvwm on 1994, when I started studying
computer sciences in IUT of Paris (France): as I
discoved Linux, I discovered fvwm, witch was my
window manager for 4 years, I'm currently using
mostly Window Maker.

Thank you for accomplished work. And also thank you
for future improvements!

/Winslow

I am new to FVWM so I apologize if this question has already been addressed.  But I am having a problem with a corrupted screen everytime I minimize or maximize a big window.  If I have a web browser open and minimize it the screen is corrupted, if I refresh it fixes the problem but having to do
this over and over is not enjoyable.  The same problem happens when open the minimized window.  

I don't think its a resolution problem because I have the same problem on 800x600 as i do on 1600x1400.  

For more help I have a Radeon VE QY card, if that makes any difference.  

If anyone has insight on to what the problem could be or
ways to fix it.  I would appreciate it.  

Ed

I was able to duplicate the problem.
FixedPPosition fixes it for me.

Hi!

I would like to express my appreciation of the fvwm window manager.
I have been a happy user of fvwm since redhat 5.1 and I have used it
ever since... Also, I dream of contributing some feature at some point 
in the future,.. great thing to be one who has contributed to the
greatest window manager out there!!

:-)

I had a similar problem which i found a solution to 
that works fine for me. I got the idea from someone I saw playing 
battlefield 1942 or some kind of shoot'em up game, which had
a HUD (Human User Ding?) that cold be raised and lowered by clicking the right mouse
button. The HUD was used for changing weapon, etc.

I have used this idea for my pager, xload, buttonbar and iconthingy:

All of these thingies which are part of the user interface are named
UIsomething, i.e. UIPager, UIButtons etc. such that the following
function will raise lower them:

AddToFunc UIRaiseLower
+ I ALL (UI*)  RaiseLower

With the following mappings pressing F12 or CTRL-Mouse3 will raise-lower
the UI.

Key F12  A       N       Function UIRaiseLower
Mouse 3         A       C       Function UIRaiseLower



Hope this also helps you!

Happy Birthday Fvwm!

I have started using fvwm since RedHat (version 5, I think)
included it as default window manager: although it looked
too much like Windows, I quickly found out I could customise just
about evertyhing, and I was hooked. This was more or less
5 years ago.

I have being using fvwm ever since, updating only occasionally.
I tried Gnome and KDE, and several other wm's, but they could never be 
as good as fvwm with my carefully crafted configuration of FvwmButtons.

Thanks to all the authors for such an enjoyable software!

Cheers,
       Roberto

Hi there!

I'm new in the list, but not in fvwm. I'm running debian in my box, and
I wanted to update to the last stable fvwm version. But the thing is
that it seems there is no debian package with fvwm.(fvwm*.deb) in
fvwm.org.

Am I right?, or I'm just not looked for correctly. Then, where can I
find it?.

Otherwise, I'm thinking in packagin it for debian.

Let's see.

Regards

Fernando

      I'm late, sorry, work...

      I use fvwm since 1995, I think, just after discovering Linux with
slackware
and motif wm (I bought it). I'm coming from OpenVMS world where X is Motif.
But
fvwm was already far above regarding features and flexibility, and
lightness. This
last point was very important at this time with old PCs. Was so pleased
with fvwm
on my personnal box that I ported it to OpenVMS around 1999 to use it at
work too.
You can't imagine the jokes I received from coworkers for that, but they
were very
impressed when I switched to the version with textured decorations... Now
these
good times have rolled, memory is cheap but fvwm is still above regarding
features,
and I can't follow the new ones even in reading this list on a regular
basis...

      Happy birthday and thanks to the team.

      Fab.

I already said this several times in the past.

If someone creates a clean procedure "make deb-dist release=1" and
"make deb-this" that does exactly what "rpm-dist" and "rpm-this" does,
it will be included in the fvwm sources. Then everyone, for example
yourself could build deb from any tar.gz or cvs automatically in minutes.

Of course the procedure should not add any extra files to deb (or as less
as possible) not to be different much from installing from the sources.
It may also use the same configure options that the rpm procedure does.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Maybe this could be taken care of by the current maintainer of the fvwm
Debian package?

What sounds weird to me, is that having available a debian package for
fvwm 2.4.6-2, which means that somebody has already made the effort, the
work has been stoped. 

So, it looks like fvwm package has become orphaned, or whatever way they
call this situation in debian.

So, before thinking seriously in packagin fvwm, I'll ask debian guys.

Thanks for your answer.

We are speaking about the clean automatical procedure of creating deb
from any tar.gz or cvs files. Something that we build may distribute
together with tar.gz on every release, and something that any deb user
can build himself. For example every rpm user may build rpm for his
system(s) for 3 years now, like this:

  make rpm-dist mparams='CFLAGS="-O3 -g"' cparams='--disable-xinerama'

If Alexander wants to provide such automatic procedure to the developers
(without adding any hook files, that may be packed in fvwm-debhooks deb),
it is ok. But until now he did not do this, so any other Debian user who
really wants immediate access to debs with any new release may volunteer.

Regards,
Mikhael.

   there's fvwm 2.4.15-2 in debian unstable

   you might want to contact current maintainer if you need/want 2.4.16

I didn't suggest you to package fvwm for Debian, there is a packager
already.

I only said that if any smart Debian user contributes an automatical
procedure for creating deb automatically, then the developers may solve
this problem for Debian users.

Until we find such volunteer (who wants to do it?), all Debian related
questions/requests/problems must be directed to debian.org, not fvwm.org.

P.S. Please put quotes before the answer on this list.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Greetings to everybody,

is there a Style setting that makes a window not appear in FvwmPager ?
I looked in the manual and I didn't find it, but
there are so many Style options that I could have missed it

Thanks in advance,
Marco

I think "WindowListSkip" is working.

Yep.  Set the Style WindowListSkip for the windows you want to
skip, and set UseSkipList for the pager:

       *FvwmPager: UseSkipList
              Tells  FvwmPager  to  not show the windows that are
              using the WindowListSkip style.

In 2.5.x use:

  *FvwmPager: UseSkipList

Is this just a temporary behaviour of the developer's version or is this 
changed definitely?

It may be the final behaviour, it is not decided yet. If you switch to a
function (with "M", "H", "C", "D" or "I") it is guaranteed to work just
like you specify. So if you don't want to be dependant on the old or new
behaviour of some Mouse commands in the window context, use a separate
function, it always worked in the past and should work in the future as
expected. The advantage of the complex functions is also that you may
bind more than one action to the same click depending on the click type.

Regards,
Mikhael.

hi,

watch this screenshot:

	http://ada2.unipv.it/~kpanic/cazzeggi/fvwm-aqua3.png

it has title text centered horizontally

I know that a TitleStyle can be Centered (horizontally), but is it
possible to center vertically?

thank you.

ciao,
Marco

I don't exactly understand what we are talking about.  The
described behaviour is nowhere in 2.4.x.  It was introduced in
2.5.7 or 2.5.6 (can't remember which).

The title is always centered vertically unless you use the Top or
Bottom option in your TitleStyle.

I think the border and the title area being almost the same color
makes the title look like its positioned too low.

This is not fully correct. Only text is centered and only if it is
shorter then the actual title height. Images are not centered.

There are several settings that affect the exact look of the titlebar.
Take a look at fvwm-themes for the tips of different titlebars looks.
Try this:

  #TitleStyle Height 20
  TitleStyle -- flat
  ButtonStyle all -- UseTitleStyle

I think this should improve your screenshot. But also be aware of the
effect Dan mentions, the border is drawn only at the top of the title,
and it has the same color.

If you use xft font you should also specify ":minspace=true:".

Regards,
Mikhael.

I apologize if this mail shows up twice, but we're having problems with
our mail server here. I did sent this mail 2 days ago, but it seems as if
it didn't show up.

oops, sorry I intended to send it to the mailing list
the screen shot above was made with xv, but somehow xv screws up the colors.
Thus here's another screen shot with a biiiiig border, where I just had the
FvwmConsole in front of the desker (now made with import). As you can see the
borders are just leftover from the window that was laying on top of the desker.
[2. application/octet-stream; magick.miff]...


If I lower the window on top, then the border is ok, but when I move it
the borders are not updated.

Now there's one more thing: when I set a style for the desker in FvwmConsole
(e.g. Style "mail" BorderWidth 18), from then on the borders are drawn
just fine.

If there's any other info I can provide, let me know.

Thanks

Klaus

Hi there,

Today when I was sitting on a Windoze machine :-( running  a
X-server,  I  noticed that xfig got it's own xfig mini icon.
Playing around showed that some applications get  thier  own
icons  (e.g.  xv,  netscape,  galeon,  gimp,..)  even  under
Windooze others get the X-Win default icon. 

So I guess that the icons might come within some
applications. I don't think that X-Win sets it.

Does anybody know something about this? 

If this assumption is true can fvwm use this icons as  well?
For  example  one  could  use it as mini icon. This would be
nice :-) 

Regards, Uwe

When I move some other window over the desker panel and then move it
away, the border is not redrawn. I've just mailed a better screen shot.

Thanks

If you use "Style * Icon, NoIconOverride" you will see these
icons in fvwm (when the window is iconified).

So, yes.

This is not possible in general ... This is done only if the
application provide an EWMH icon (or/and mini-icon). GNOME2 and KDE>=2
(and others) provide such icons but not the applications you mention
(but galeon "2" ??)

Your feature request should be send at the good place :o)

thanks, you're right, it works

still I don't understand why the line:
*FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets: BorderWidth 2
leads to "FvwmButtons-FvwmApplets: Button confusion! Quitting"

thanks, I'll have to see if I can figure out how to make a button of this.

Hello.

When I'm tweaking my config file I often restart fvwm using the key combo 
Key Space A CSM   Restart "/home/djm/bin/fvwm" 
Every so often I get timeouts associated with FvwmAnimate while loading FvwmIconMan.

~/bin/fvwm --version
fvwm 2.5.7 (from cvs) compiled on Apr 16 2003 at 11:00:59 
with support for: ReadLine, RPlay, Stroke, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, Bidi text, XRender, XFT, NLS

Some possibly relevant lines from my config are:

*FvwmIconMan: NoIconAction "SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate"
SetAnimation  10  -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0

The error message is:
[FVWM] [FlushMessageQueue]: <<ERROR>> Failed to write descriptor to 'FvwmAnimate':
- select rc=0
- terminate signal=N

It doesn't happen every time I restart, and it seems to be random whether 
it happens or not - at least, I can't pinpoint what makes it occur or not. 
It has never occurred when fvwm starts for the first time. 

Any ideas why this might be happening or what I can do about it?

cheers,

^d

Post your config (preferrably stripped down to the minimum that
shows the problem) and try to start FvwmAnimate last.

Klaus said he sent the screenshot, but it didn't show up. I think it will
show up when Jason returns online (attachments are moderated).

In the meantime, here is the image converted from .miff:

INFORMACAO CONFIDENCIAL

 Prezado(a) Amigo(a):

 Esta carta/e-mail nada tem de semelhante As muitas
 "aldrabices" que circulam
 pela Internet.
 Ela  uma mensagem rara que tem um conteUdo que pode
 modificar a sua vida
 para melhor.
 Assim, peco-lhe um pouco de paciencia, e que a leia
 com atencao, muita atencao,

 e no final, muito provavelmente, se sentira
 recompensado(a).
 Este e um assunto que certamente sera do seu
 interesse.
 Entao, por favor, pare para ler algo que vai resolver
 grande parte dos seus
 possiveis problemas.
 Nao vai levar mais do que alguns minutos.

 O meu nome e Joao Carlos e sou um pequeno
 empresario.
 No ano passado tive graves problemas financeiros.
 Endividei-me desmesuradamente devido a retracco do
 mercado para os produtos
 que
 vendia e tambem pelos altos juros que pagava na banca
 - contractos para capital
 de circulacao, etc..
 Os meus amigos afastaram-se, com receio de pedidos de
 dinheiro emprestado ou
 avais bancarios.
 Passei a trabalhar com saldos bancarios negativos e
 os meus cartoes de credito

 acumularam uma divida enorme, os quais tinha usado
 para levar adiante o meu
 negocio e sustentar a minha familia de seis pessoas.
 Ja nao suportava as
 interminaveis
 ligacoes telefonicas dos credores, de cartas de
 cobranca de advogados e visitas
 de cobradores. Sendo cristao, sinceramente acreditava
 numa possivel solucao dos
 meus problemas. Apesar de muito abatido por tal
 situacao, comecei a rezar
 fervorosamente por ajuda.


 "Esta nao e uma carta para salvar sua alma".
 Esta carta pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Em Junho de 2002, recebi pelo correio electronico
 (e-mail) uma informacao
 inusitada.
 E claro, ela veio espontaneamente. Simplesmente
 pegaram no meu nome/e-mail em
 alguma base de dados ou de algum provedor. Gracas a
 Deus por isso!

 Depois de ter lido a informacao por varias vezes, mal
 pude acreditar no que os
 meus olhos tinham visto. Diante de mim estava uma
 estupenda maneira de
 resolver todos os meus problemas. Eu nao teria que
 investir quase nada, e mais,

 sem me endividar novamente. Logo peguei num papel e
 caneta e comecei a
 fazer alguns calculos.
 Conclui que o que iria fazer era um investimento
 baixissimo e, no minimo,
 ainda assim, teria minha aplicao de volta.
 Pensei: "Por que nao? Pior do que eu ja estava nao
 podia ficar".

 Segui as instruccoes correcta e minuciosamente.
 Enviei, inicialmente, 250
 e-mails e o dinheiro comecou a chegar. Vagarosamente
 no inicio, mas apos
 algumas
 semanas eu estava a receber mais e-mails do que
 poderia ler num dia.
 Passados tres meses, mais ou menos, o dinheiro parou
 de chegar.
 Como tinha feito um registro preciso do dinheiro
 recebido, fiquei
 estarrecido.
 O final totalizava  199.498,00 (Cento e noventa e
 nove mil,
 quatrocentos e noventa e oito uros). Fantastico!!!

 Paguei todas as minhas dividas, comprei um carro
 novo, uma bela casa e
 enviei de forma intercalada (quatro vezes de 250)
 mais 1.000
 cartas/e-mails.
 Em quatro meses, aproximadamente, recebi 
 898.072,66
 (Oitocentos e noventa e oito mil e setenta e dois
 uros e sessenta e seis
 centimos).


 Leia atentamente este programa.
 Ele pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Lembre-se: este programa nao funciona, se nao for
 colocado em pratica de
 forma correcta e como indicado nas instrucoes
 adiante. Esta e uma grande
 oportunidade,
 com pouquissimo custo ou risco. Se voce decidir
 participar, salve este arquivo
 no seu
 disco rigido ou disquete, passe o anti-virus, siga
 exactamente o programa, e
 voc estara
 no caminho da sua seguranca financeira.

 Se voce e cristao e tem fe na providencia divina (a
 suprema sabedoria com
 que Deus conduz todas as coisas), e esta com
 problemas financeiros como eu
 estava, isto e um sinal.
 Deus o(a) abencoe!


 INSTRUCOES

 Siga exactamente as simples instrucoes abaixo, e em
 tres meses
 aproximadamente voce recebera mais de  100.000,00
 (Cem mil uros).
 GARANTIDO.

 1. Imediatamente, mande  1,00 (Um uro) para cada
 uma das seis
 pessoas que estao relacionadas na listagem abaixo. Da
 seguinte forma: deposite
 esta
 quantia (ou faca simplesmente uma transferencia
 bancaria) na conta-corrente
 delas e nao se aborreca caso tenha que ir a varias
 agencias bancarias.
 (Ha uma lei divina que exige algum sacrificio
 (imolacao) ou trabalho
 cansativo e arduo para se obter os resultados
 desejados.)

 2. Quando depositar  1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente das seis
 pessoas da lista, voce precisa mandar um e-mail para
 cada uma delas dizendo:
 "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja incluido no seu
 cadastro de
 correspondencias". Esta e
 a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operacao
 bancaria e fica de acordo
 com a legislacao vigente. A legislacao diz que todo
 dinheiro recebido deve
 ser trocado por um produto ou servico. Este  o
 servico! (Posteriormente,
 as pessoas que fizerem depositos na sua
 conta-corrente farao o mesmo.)

 3. Apos ter depositado  1,00 (Um uro) em cada uma
 das seis
 pessoas, digite uma nova lista. Em seguida tire o
 nome que esta no nmero 1
 (um) e
 mude os nomes restantes para uma posicao acima (o
 segundo nome passa para o nr
 1,
 o terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em
 nenhuma hipotese mude a
 sequencia de nomes.
 Nao coloque o seu nome numa posicao diferente, pois
 nao funciona. O seu nome
 devera estar no nr. 6.
 (Caso voce mude a sequencia de nomes, isso denotara
 egoismo e contraria os
 principios basicos da solidariedade e fraternidade
 estabelecidos por lei divina
 -
 como voc vera a frente.)

 4. Pegue em 250 nomes/e-mails de alguma empresa que
 forneca listagens de
 e-mails. Ou tente consegui-los de qualquer outra
 forma (em classificados por
 exmplo)

 5. Completada a etapa anterior (nr 4), insira os
 nomes/e-mails adquiridos
 nos arquivos de seu programa de E-Mails - outlook ou
 outro - e envie com esse
 mesmo texto.
 Voce devera salvar a sua lista no formato TXT ou Rich
 Text Format, porque
 muitas pessoas nao tem um processador de texto
 moderno - nos formatos sugeridos
 a
 carta/e-mail abre em qualquer computador. E bom
 enviar aos poucos, durante 5 a
 10 dias, nao mais que isso.
 6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrucoes deste
 programa e dentro de
 aproximadamente 90 dias voce ir receber, garantidos,
 mais de  100.000,00 (Cem
 mil uros)


 COMO FUNCIONA O PROGRAMA

 Digamos que voce tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3%
 dos e-mails enviados,
 o que e uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas
 minhas duas tentativas
 tive mais do que 3% de retorno.

 1. Quando voce manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca
 de 7 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 2. Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 3. Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 4. Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam
  1,00.
 5. Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 21.937 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 6. Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 164.527 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.

 E segue assim, numa progressao geometrica. Em algum
 ponto o seu nome saira
 da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas.
 Mas, voce recebeu
 aproximadamente
  199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso
 funciona sempre. No exemplo
 acima, voce tera enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce
 enviar 1.000
 cartas/e-mails, pode
 chegar a receber  898.072,66 - que foi o que recebi.
 Fantastico, nao e
 verdade?

 Se voce quiser, faca alguns calculos por si mesmo.
 Com esse tipo de retorno,
 mesmo com a crise em que estamos vivendo, voce podera
 alcancar 40% desses
 valores - o que significa 1% de retorno - o que ja
 pode mudar sua vida. Veja
 que,
 40% de  898.072,66 sao  359.229,06. Participe e nao
 se arrependera.
 Acredite... tenha fe!

 Por fim, o programa so funciona se voce depositar 
 1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente de cada uma das seis pessoas adiante
 relacionadas, e enviar - a
 todas elas - um e-mail solicitando a inclusao de seu
 nome/e-mail na lista de
 correspondencias delas.
 Lembre-se que milhares de pessoas farao o mesmo em
 relacao a voce.

 Obs.: Imprima essa lista.

 Importante: Repare que todos os nomes que constam da
 lista nao estao
 completos.
 Esse anonimato e propositado. Tem a finalidade de
 preservar as pessoas e,
 ao mesmo tempo, cumprir um ritual de varias tradicoes
 espirituais: "Fazer o Bem
 sem olhar a Quem".
 Faca o mesmo com o seu nome.


 OBSERVACOES

 1. Nao envie essa mensagem como anexo, pois algumas
 pessoas evitam abrir
 com medo que contenha virus.
 2. Siga exactamente as instrucoes contidas nesta
 carta/e-mail.
 3. Nao mude, em nenhuma circunstancia, a sequencia
 dos nomes da listagem.
 A unica excepcao, evidentemente, e excluir o que
 estiver em primeiro lugar e
 incluir o seu nome na sexta posicao da lista.
 4. Nao se esquea de enviar um e-mail para cada uma
 das pessoas da listagem,
 solicitando que elas incluam seu nome/e-mail "na
 lista de correspondencias"
 delas.
 Isso caracteriza um servico e da respaldo legal aos
 depositos bancarios.
 5. Como a importancia de 1,00 (Um uro) e, na
 verdade, uma quantia
 irrisoria, faca imediatamente os depositos na
 conta-corrente dos nomes da
 listagem.
 Isso faz com que a circulacao monetaria permaneca
 activa e nao haja nenhuma
 interrupcao dos fluxos financeiros.


 COMENTARIO FINAL

 Como e que voce percebe o mundo e sua volta? Atraves
 dos cinco sentidos, e
 claro.
 Mas sera que nao existe nada alem do que os nossos
 sentidos percebem?
 A nossa percepcao esta restrita aos nossos orgaos
 sensoriais? So existe o
 mundo que nossos sentidos detectam?

 Estas perguntas nao sao novas. Elas tem sido motivo
 de reflexao para muitas
 geracoes de seres humanos. Porem, ainda assim, ha
 aqueles que so acreditam
 naquilo que veem ou sentem. Nao se preocupam com as
 indagacoes pertinentes
 a busca do misterio da vida. Sao os cepticos, os
 pessimistas. Acham que como
 pano
 de fundo das accoes dos homens so ha a dissimulacao,
 a vontade de enganar os
 outros
 em beneficio proprio.

 Entretanto, olhe la para fora. O que voce ve? A rua,
 automoveis, asfalto,
 pessoas e assim por diante. O mundo da materia. Sera
 que a sa isso que
 existe?
 Nao existe mais nada?

 Agora, volte a olhar com bastante atencao. Onde estao
 as ondas do radio
 que voce escuta?
 Onde estao as ondas da televisao que voce assiste?
 Voce nao as ve, mas
 sabe que elas existem.
 Isso para voce tem credibilidade.

 Ha milhoes de anos um asteroide, mais ou menos do
 tamanho do planeta Marte,
 colidiu com a Terra e surgiu a Lua. Depois dessa
 colisao, a Lua manteve uma
 distancia tao precisa em relacao ao nosso planeta,
 que pode controlar o fluxo e
 refluxo das mares nos oceanos da Terra. O Sol se
 estivesse um pouco mais longe,
 morreriamos de frio e se estivesse um pouco mais
 perto morreriamos devido ao
 seu fogo abrasador.
 Se Jupiter e Saturno nao estivessem numa posicao
 perfeitamente correcta no
 sistema solar, a falta da gravidade de ambos faria
 com que a Terra fosse
 bombardeada
 continuamente pelos detritos cosmicos.
 Sera que esse excepcional sistema surgiu por acaso?

 O acaso nao existe. O que existe e uma fora
 extraordinaria, misteriosa,
 que tem poder sobre todas as coisas. Se voce pode
 acreditar nas ondas do
 radio e da televisao sem ve-las. Se admite que nao
 pode haver apenas
 coincidencias na formacao do nosso sistema solar. Por
 que nao admitir tambem a
 existencia de uma fonte de sabedoria e bondade que
 tudo envolve e protege? Por
 que nao admitir que essa forca
 esta alem dos nossos sentidos fisicos?

 Por ultimo, uma recomendacao. A melhor maneira de nos
 comunicar com essa
 forca "divina" e a oracao. Assim, se voce se resolver
 a dar-me um voto de
 confianca e
 participar neste maravilhoso programa, ao enviar sua
 quota de e-mails, faca uma
 oracao.
 E depois, aguarde com confianca e fe. Boa sorte!

 Cordialmente,

 Joao Carlos W.F.
 (Esta carta foi escrita por Joao Carlos W.F., e e a

 pelos constantes da lista acima - voce podera usar a
 mesma ou modifica-la
 contando a sua propria historia, desde que seja
 VERDADEIRA)

 suas ideias e planos,

INFORMACAO CONFIDENCIAL

 Prezado(a) Amigo(a):

 Esta carta/e-mail nada tem de semelhante As muitas
 "aldrabices" que circulam
 pela Internet.
 Ela  uma mensagem rara que tem um conteUdo que pode
 modificar a sua vida
 para melhor.
 Assim, peco-lhe um pouco de paciencia, e que a leia
 com atencao, muita atencao,

 e no final, muito provavelmente, se sentira
 recompensado(a).
 Este e um assunto que certamente sera do seu
 interesse.
 Entao, por favor, pare para ler algo que vai resolver
 grande parte dos seus
 possiveis problemas.
 Nao vai levar mais do que alguns minutos.

 O meu nome e Joao Carlos e sou um pequeno
 empresario.
 No ano passado tive graves problemas financeiros.
 Endividei-me desmesuradamente devido a retracco do
 mercado para os produtos
 que
 vendia e tambem pelos altos juros que pagava na banca
 - contractos para capital
 de circulacao, etc..
 Os meus amigos afastaram-se, com receio de pedidos de
 dinheiro emprestado ou
 avais bancarios.
 Passei a trabalhar com saldos bancarios negativos e
 os meus cartoes de credito

 acumularam uma divida enorme, os quais tinha usado
 para levar adiante o meu
 negocio e sustentar a minha familia de seis pessoas.
 Ja nao suportava as
 interminaveis
 ligacoes telefonicas dos credores, de cartas de
 cobranca de advogados e visitas
 de cobradores. Sendo cristao, sinceramente acreditava
 numa possivel solucao dos
 meus problemas. Apesar de muito abatido por tal
 situacao, comecei a rezar
 fervorosamente por ajuda.


 "Esta nao e uma carta para salvar sua alma".
 Esta carta pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Em Junho de 2002, recebi pelo correio electronico
 (e-mail) uma informacao
 inusitada.
 E claro, ela veio espontaneamente. Simplesmente
 pegaram no meu nome/e-mail em
 alguma base de dados ou de algum provedor. Gracas a
 Deus por isso!

 Depois de ter lido a informacao por varias vezes, mal
 pude acreditar no que os
 meus olhos tinham visto. Diante de mim estava uma
 estupenda maneira de
 resolver todos os meus problemas. Eu nao teria que
 investir quase nada, e mais,

 sem me endividar novamente. Logo peguei num papel e
 caneta e comecei a
 fazer alguns calculos.
 Conclui que o que iria fazer era um investimento
 baixissimo e, no minimo,
 ainda assim, teria minha aplicao de volta.
 Pensei: "Por que nao? Pior do que eu ja estava nao
 podia ficar".

 Segui as instruccoes correcta e minuciosamente.
 Enviei, inicialmente, 250
 e-mails e o dinheiro comecou a chegar. Vagarosamente
 no inicio, mas apos
 algumas
 semanas eu estava a receber mais e-mails do que
 poderia ler num dia.
 Passados tres meses, mais ou menos, o dinheiro parou
 de chegar.
 Como tinha feito um registro preciso do dinheiro
 recebido, fiquei
 estarrecido.
 O final totalizava  199.498,00 (Cento e noventa e
 nove mil,
 quatrocentos e noventa e oito uros). Fantastico!!!

 Paguei todas as minhas dividas, comprei um carro
 novo, uma bela casa e
 enviei de forma intercalada (quatro vezes de 250)
 mais 1.000
 cartas/e-mails.
 Em quatro meses, aproximadamente, recebi 
 898.072,66
 (Oitocentos e noventa e oito mil e setenta e dois
 uros e sessenta e seis
 centimos).


 Leia atentamente este programa.
 Ele pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Lembre-se: este programa nao funciona, se nao for
 colocado em pratica de
 forma correcta e como indicado nas instrucoes
 adiante. Esta e uma grande
 oportunidade,
 com pouquissimo custo ou risco. Se voce decidir
 participar, salve este arquivo
 no seu
 disco rigido ou disquete, passe o anti-virus, siga
 exactamente o programa, e
 voc estara
 no caminho da sua seguranca financeira.

 Se voce e cristao e tem fe na providencia divina (a
 suprema sabedoria com
 que Deus conduz todas as coisas), e esta com
 problemas financeiros como eu
 estava, isto e um sinal.
 Deus o(a) abencoe!


 INSTRUCOES

 Siga exactamente as simples instrucoes abaixo, e em
 tres meses
 aproximadamente voce recebera mais de  100.000,00
 (Cem mil uros).
 GARANTIDO.

 1. Imediatamente, mande  1,00 (Um uro) para cada
 uma das seis
 pessoas que estao relacionadas na listagem abaixo. Da
 seguinte forma: deposite
 esta
 quantia (ou faca simplesmente uma transferencia
 bancaria) na conta-corrente
 delas e nao se aborreca caso tenha que ir a varias
 agencias bancarias.
 (Ha uma lei divina que exige algum sacrificio
 (imolacao) ou trabalho
 cansativo e arduo para se obter os resultados
 desejados.)

 2. Quando depositar  1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente das seis
 pessoas da lista, voce precisa mandar um e-mail para
 cada uma delas dizendo:
 "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja incluido no seu
 cadastro de
 correspondencias". Esta e
 a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operacao
 bancaria e fica de acordo
 com a legislacao vigente. A legislacao diz que todo
 dinheiro recebido deve
 ser trocado por um produto ou servico. Este  o
 servico! (Posteriormente,
 as pessoas que fizerem depositos na sua
 conta-corrente farao o mesmo.)

 3. Apos ter depositado  1,00 (Um uro) em cada uma
 das seis
 pessoas, digite uma nova lista. Em seguida tire o
 nome que esta no nmero 1
 (um) e
 mude os nomes restantes para uma posicao acima (o
 segundo nome passa para o nr
 1,
 o terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em
 nenhuma hipotese mude a
 sequencia de nomes.
 Nao coloque o seu nome numa posicao diferente, pois
 nao funciona. O seu nome
 devera estar no nr. 6.
 (Caso voce mude a sequencia de nomes, isso denotara
 egoismo e contraria os
 principios basicos da solidariedade e fraternidade
 estabelecidos por lei divina
 -
 como voc vera a frente.)

 4. Pegue em 250 nomes/e-mails de alguma empresa que
 forneca listagens de
 e-mails. Ou tente consegui-los de qualquer outra
 forma (em classificados por
 exmplo)

 5. Completada a etapa anterior (nr 4), insira os
 nomes/e-mails adquiridos
 nos arquivos de seu programa de E-Mails - outlook ou
 outro - e envie com esse
 mesmo texto.
 Voce devera salvar a sua lista no formato TXT ou Rich
 Text Format, porque
 muitas pessoas nao tem um processador de texto
 moderno - nos formatos sugeridos
 a
 carta/e-mail abre em qualquer computador. E bom
 enviar aos poucos, durante 5 a
 10 dias, nao mais que isso.
 6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrucoes deste
 programa e dentro de
 aproximadamente 90 dias voce ir receber, garantidos,
 mais de  100.000,00 (Cem
 mil uros)


 COMO FUNCIONA O PROGRAMA

 Digamos que voce tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3%
 dos e-mails enviados,
 o que e uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas
 minhas duas tentativas
 tive mais do que 3% de retorno.

 1. Quando voce manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca
 de 7 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 2. Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 3. Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 4. Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam
  1,00.
 5. Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 21.937 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 6. Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 164.527 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.

 E segue assim, numa progressao geometrica. Em algum
 ponto o seu nome saira
 da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas.
 Mas, voce recebeu
 aproximadamente
  199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso
 funciona sempre. No exemplo
 acima, voce tera enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce
 enviar 1.000
 cartas/e-mails, pode
 chegar a receber  898.072,66 - que foi o que recebi.
 Fantastico, nao e
 verdade?

 Se voce quiser, faca alguns calculos por si mesmo.
 Com esse tipo de retorno,
 mesmo com a crise em que estamos vivendo, voce podera
 alcancar 40% desses
 valores - o que significa 1% de retorno - o que ja
 pode mudar sua vida. Veja
 que,
 40% de  898.072,66 sao  359.229,06. Participe e nao
 se arrependera.
 Acredite... tenha fe!

 Por fim, o programa so funciona se voce depositar 
 1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente de cada uma das seis pessoas adiante
 relacionadas, e enviar - a
 todas elas - um e-mail solicitando a inclusao de seu
 nome/e-mail na lista de
 correspondencias delas.
 Lembre-se que milhares de pessoas farao o mesmo em
 relacao a voce.

 Obs.: Imprima essa lista.

 Importante: Repare que todos os nomes que constam da
 lista nao estao
 completos.
 Esse anonimato e propositado. Tem a finalidade de
 preservar as pessoas e,
 ao mesmo tempo, cumprir um ritual de varias tradicoes
 espirituais: "Fazer o Bem
 sem olhar a Quem".
 Faca o mesmo com o seu nome.


 OBSERVACOES

 1. Nao envie essa mensagem como anexo, pois algumas
 pessoas evitam abrir
 com medo que contenha virus.
 2. Siga exactamente as instrucoes contidas nesta
 carta/e-mail.
 3. Nao mude, em nenhuma circunstancia, a sequencia
 dos nomes da listagem.
 A unica excepcao, evidentemente, e excluir o que
 estiver em primeiro lugar e
 incluir o seu nome na sexta posicao da lista.
 4. Nao se esquea de enviar um e-mail para cada uma
 das pessoas da listagem,
 solicitando que elas incluam seu nome/e-mail "na
 lista de correspondencias"
 delas.
 Isso caracteriza um servico e da respaldo legal aos
 depositos bancarios.
 5. Como a importancia de 1,00 (Um uro) e, na
 verdade, uma quantia
 irrisoria, faca imediatamente os depositos na
 conta-corrente dos nomes da
 listagem.
 Isso faz com que a circulacao monetaria permaneca
 activa e nao haja nenhuma
 interrupcao dos fluxos financeiros.


 COMENTARIO FINAL

 Como e que voce percebe o mundo e sua volta? Atraves
 dos cinco sentidos, e
 claro.
 Mas sera que nao existe nada alem do que os nossos
 sentidos percebem?
 A nossa percepcao esta restrita aos nossos orgaos
 sensoriais? So existe o
 mundo que nossos sentidos detectam?

 Estas perguntas nao sao novas. Elas tem sido motivo
 de reflexao para muitas
 geracoes de seres humanos. Porem, ainda assim, ha
 aqueles que so acreditam
 naquilo que veem ou sentem. Nao se preocupam com as
 indagacoes pertinentes
 a busca do misterio da vida. Sao os cepticos, os
 pessimistas. Acham que como
 pano
 de fundo das accoes dos homens so ha a dissimulacao,
 a vontade de enganar os
 outros
 em beneficio proprio.

 Entretanto, olhe la para fora. O que voce ve? A rua,
 automoveis, asfalto,
 pessoas e assim por diante. O mundo da materia. Sera
 que a sa isso que
 existe?
 Nao existe mais nada?

 Agora, volte a olhar com bastante atencao. Onde estao
 as ondas do radio
 que voce escuta?
 Onde estao as ondas da televisao que voce assiste?
 Voce nao as ve, mas
 sabe que elas existem.
 Isso para voce tem credibilidade.

 Ha milhoes de anos um asteroide, mais ou menos do
 tamanho do planeta Marte,
 colidiu com a Terra e surgiu a Lua. Depois dessa
 colisao, a Lua manteve uma
 distancia tao precisa em relacao ao nosso planeta,
 que pode controlar o fluxo e
 refluxo das mares nos oceanos da Terra. O Sol se
 estivesse um pouco mais longe,
 morreriamos de frio e se estivesse um pouco mais
 perto morreriamos devido ao
 seu fogo abrasador.
 Se Jupiter e Saturno nao estivessem numa posicao
 perfeitamente correcta no
 sistema solar, a falta da gravidade de ambos faria
 com que a Terra fosse
 bombardeada
 continuamente pelos detritos cosmicos.
 Sera que esse excepcional sistema surgiu por acaso?

 O acaso nao existe. O que existe e uma fora
 extraordinaria, misteriosa,
 que tem poder sobre todas as coisas. Se voce pode
 acreditar nas ondas do
 radio e da televisao sem ve-las. Se admite que nao
 pode haver apenas
 coincidencias na formacao do nosso sistema solar. Por
 que nao admitir tambem a
 existencia de uma fonte de sabedoria e bondade que
 tudo envolve e protege? Por
 que nao admitir que essa forca
 esta alem dos nossos sentidos fisicos?

 Por ultimo, uma recomendacao. A melhor maneira de nos
 comunicar com essa
 forca "divina" e a oracao. Assim, se voce se resolver
 a dar-me um voto de
 confianca e
 participar neste maravilhoso programa, ao enviar sua
 quota de e-mails, faca uma
 oracao.
 E depois, aguarde com confianca e fe. Boa sorte!

 Cordialmente,

 Joao Carlos W.F.
 (Esta carta foi escrita por Joao Carlos W.F., e e a
 mesma (original) recebida
 pelos constantes da lista acima - voce podera usar a
 mesma ou modifica-la
 contando a sua propria historia, desde que seja
 VERDADEIRA)

 PS.: E melhor agir do que falar. Quem muito fala das
 suas ideias e planos,
 atrai a inveja, a descrenca e o "mau-olhado". Por
 isso, estas informacoes
 foram-lhe enviadas a si com caracter confidencial.

INFORMACAO CONFIDENCIAL

 Prezado(a) Amigo(a):

 Esta carta/e-mail nada tem de semelhante As muitas
 "aldrabices" que circulam
 pela Internet.
 Ela  uma mensagem rara que tem um conteUdo que pode
 modificar a sua vida
 para melhor.
 Assim, peco-lhe um pouco de paciencia, e que a leia
 com atencao, muita atencao,

 e no final, muito provavelmente, se sentira
 recompensado(a).
 Este e um assunto que certamente sera do seu
 interesse.
 Entao, por favor, pare para ler algo que vai resolver
 grande parte dos seus
 possiveis problemas.
 Nao vai levar mais do que alguns minutos.

 O meu nome e Joao Carlos e sou um pequeno
 empresario.
 No ano passado tive graves problemas financeiros.
 Endividei-me desmesuradamente devido a retracco do
 mercado para os produtos
 que
 vendia e tambem pelos altos juros que pagava na banca
 - contractos para capital
 de circulacao, etc..
 Os meus amigos afastaram-se, com receio de pedidos de
 dinheiro emprestado ou
 avais bancarios.
 Passei a trabalhar com saldos bancarios negativos e
 os meus cartoes de credito

 acumularam uma divida enorme, os quais tinha usado
 para levar adiante o meu
 negocio e sustentar a minha familia de seis pessoas.
 Ja nao suportava as
 interminaveis
 ligacoes telefonicas dos credores, de cartas de
 cobranca de advogados e visitas
 de cobradores. Sendo cristao, sinceramente acreditava
 numa possivel solucao dos
 meus problemas. Apesar de muito abatido por tal
 situacao, comecei a rezar
 fervorosamente por ajuda.


 "Esta nao e uma carta para salvar sua alma".
 Esta carta pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Em Junho de 2002, recebi pelo correio electronico
 (e-mail) uma informacao
 inusitada.
 E claro, ela veio espontaneamente. Simplesmente
 pegaram no meu nome/e-mail em
 alguma base de dados ou de algum provedor. Gracas a
 Deus por isso!

 Depois de ter lido a informacao por varias vezes, mal
 pude acreditar no que os
 meus olhos tinham visto. Diante de mim estava uma
 estupenda maneira de
 resolver todos os meus problemas. Eu nao teria que
 investir quase nada, e mais,

 sem me endividar novamente. Logo peguei num papel e
 caneta e comecei a
 fazer alguns calculos.
 Conclui que o que iria fazer era um investimento
 baixissimo e, no minimo,
 ainda assim, teria minha aplicao de volta.
 Pensei: "Por que nao? Pior do que eu ja estava nao
 podia ficar".

 Segui as instruccoes correcta e minuciosamente.
 Enviei, inicialmente, 250
 e-mails e o dinheiro comecou a chegar. Vagarosamente
 no inicio, mas apos
 algumas
 semanas eu estava a receber mais e-mails do que
 poderia ler num dia.
 Passados tres meses, mais ou menos, o dinheiro parou
 de chegar.
 Como tinha feito um registro preciso do dinheiro
 recebido, fiquei
 estarrecido.
 O final totalizava  199.498,00 (Cento e noventa e
 nove mil,
 quatrocentos e noventa e oito uros). Fantastico!!!

 Paguei todas as minhas dividas, comprei um carro
 novo, uma bela casa e
 enviei de forma intercalada (quatro vezes de 250)
 mais 1.000
 cartas/e-mails.
 Em quatro meses, aproximadamente, recebi 
 898.072,66
 (Oitocentos e noventa e oito mil e setenta e dois
 uros e sessenta e seis
 centimos).


 Leia atentamente este programa.
 Ele pode mudar sua vida para sempre.


 Lembre-se: este programa nao funciona, se nao for
 colocado em pratica de
 forma correcta e como indicado nas instrucoes
 adiante. Esta e uma grande
 oportunidade,
 com pouquissimo custo ou risco. Se voce decidir
 participar, salve este arquivo
 no seu
 disco rigido ou disquete, passe o anti-virus, siga
 exactamente o programa, e
 voc estara
 no caminho da sua seguranca financeira.

 Se voce e cristao e tem fe na providencia divina (a
 suprema sabedoria com
 que Deus conduz todas as coisas), e esta com
 problemas financeiros como eu
 estava, isto e um sinal.
 Deus o(a) abencoe!


 INSTRUCOES

 Siga exactamente as simples instrucoes abaixo, e em
 tres meses
 aproximadamente voce recebera mais de  100.000,00
 (Cem mil uros).
 GARANTIDO.

 1. Imediatamente, mande  1,00 (Um uro) para cada
 uma das seis
 pessoas que estao relacionadas na listagem abaixo. Da
 seguinte forma: deposite
 esta
 quantia (ou faca simplesmente uma transferencia
 bancaria) na conta-corrente
 delas e nao se aborreca caso tenha que ir a varias
 agencias bancarias.
 (Ha uma lei divina que exige algum sacrificio
 (imolacao) ou trabalho
 cansativo e arduo para se obter os resultados
 desejados.)

 2. Quando depositar  1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente das seis
 pessoas da lista, voce precisa mandar um e-mail para
 cada uma delas dizendo:
 "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja incluido no seu
 cadastro de
 correspondencias". Esta e
 a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a operacao
 bancaria e fica de acordo
 com a legislacao vigente. A legislacao diz que todo
 dinheiro recebido deve
 ser trocado por um produto ou servico. Este  o
 servico! (Posteriormente,
 as pessoas que fizerem depositos na sua
 conta-corrente farao o mesmo.)

 3. Apos ter depositado  1,00 (Um uro) em cada uma
 das seis
 pessoas, digite uma nova lista. Em seguida tire o
 nome que esta no nmero 1
 (um) e
 mude os nomes restantes para uma posicao acima (o
 segundo nome passa para o nr
 1,
 o terceiro para o nr. 2 e assim por diante). Em
 nenhuma hipotese mude a
 sequencia de nomes.
 Nao coloque o seu nome numa posicao diferente, pois
 nao funciona. O seu nome
 devera estar no nr. 6.
 (Caso voce mude a sequencia de nomes, isso denotara
 egoismo e contraria os
 principios basicos da solidariedade e fraternidade
 estabelecidos por lei divina
 -
 como voc vera a frente.)

 4. Pegue em 250 nomes/e-mails de alguma empresa que
 forneca listagens de
 e-mails. Ou tente consegui-los de qualquer outra
 forma (em classificados por
 exmplo)

 5. Completada a etapa anterior (nr 4), insira os
 nomes/e-mails adquiridos
 nos arquivos de seu programa de E-Mails - outlook ou
 outro - e envie com esse
 mesmo texto.
 Voce devera salvar a sua lista no formato TXT ou Rich
 Text Format, porque
 muitas pessoas nao tem um processador de texto
 moderno - nos formatos sugeridos
 a
 carta/e-mail abre em qualquer computador. E bom
 enviar aos poucos, durante 5 a
 10 dias, nao mais que isso.
 6. Siga estrita e exactamente as instrucoes deste
 programa e dentro de
 aproximadamente 90 dias voce ir receber, garantidos,
 mais de  100.000,00 (Cem
 mil uros)


 COMO FUNCIONA O PROGRAMA

 Digamos que voce tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3%
 dos e-mails enviados,
 o que e uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Nas
 minhas duas tentativas
 tive mais do que 3% de retorno.

 1. Quando voce manda 250 e-mails com a carta, cerca
 de 7 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 2. Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 3. Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390
 pessoas lhe mandam 
 1,00.
 4. Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam
  1,00.
 5. Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 21.937 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.
 6. Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de
 164.527 pessoas lhe
 mandam  1,00.

 E segue assim, numa progressao geometrica. Em algum
 ponto o seu nome saira
 da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas.
 Mas, voce recebeu
 aproximadamente
  199.498,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso). Isso
 funciona sempre. No exemplo
 acima, voce tera enviado 250 cartas/e-mails. Se voce
 enviar 1.000
 cartas/e-mails, pode
 chegar a receber  898.072,66 - que foi o que recebi.
 Fantastico, nao e
 verdade?

 Se voce quiser, faca alguns calculos por si mesmo.
 Com esse tipo de retorno,
 mesmo com a crise em que estamos vivendo, voce podera
 alcancar 40% desses
 valores - o que significa 1% de retorno - o que ja
 pode mudar sua vida. Veja
 que,
 40% de  898.072,66 sao  359.229,06. Participe e nao
 se arrependera.
 Acredite... tenha fe!

 Por fim, o programa so funciona se voce depositar 
 1,00 (Um uro) na
 conta-corrente de cada uma das seis pessoas adiante
 relacionadas, e enviar - a
 todas elas - um e-mail solicitando a inclusao de seu
 nome/e-mail na lista de
 correspondencias delas.
 Lembre-se que milhares de pessoas farao o mesmo em
 relacao a voce.

 Obs.: Imprima essa lista.

 Importante: Repare que todos os nomes que constam da
 lista nao estao
 completos.
 Esse anonimato e propositado. Tem a finalidade de
 preservar as pessoas e,
 ao mesmo tempo, cumprir um ritual de varias tradicoes
 espirituais: "Fazer o Bem
 sem olhar a Quem".
 Faca o mesmo com o seu nome.


 OBSERVACOES

 1. Nao envie essa mensagem como anexo, pois algumas
 pessoas evitam abrir
 com medo que contenha virus.
 2. Siga exactamente as instrucoes contidas nesta
 carta/e-mail.
 3. Nao mude, em nenhuma circunstancia, a sequencia
 dos nomes da listagem.
 A unica excepcao, evidentemente, e excluir o que
 estiver em primeiro lugar e
 incluir o seu nome na sexta posicao da lista.
 4. Nao se esquea de enviar um e-mail para cada uma
 das pessoas da listagem,
 solicitando que elas incluam seu nome/e-mail "na
 lista de correspondencias"
 delas.
 Isso caracteriza um servico e da respaldo legal aos
 depositos bancarios.
 5. Como a importancia de 1,00 (Um uro) e, na
 verdade, uma quantia
 irrisoria, faca imediatamente os depositos na
 conta-corrente dos nomes da
 listagem.
 Isso faz com que a circulacao monetaria permaneca
 activa e nao haja nenhuma
 interrupcao dos fluxos financeiros.


 COMENTARIO FINAL

 Como e que voce percebe o mundo e sua volta? Atraves
 dos cinco sentidos, e
 claro.
 Mas sera que nao existe nada alem do que os nossos
 sentidos percebem?
 A nossa percepcao esta restrita aos nossos orgaos
 sensoriais? So existe o
 mundo que nossos sentidos detectam?

 Estas perguntas nao sao novas. Elas tem sido motivo
 de reflexao para muitas
 geracoes de seres humanos. Porem, ainda assim, ha
 aqueles que so acreditam
 naquilo que veem ou sentem. Nao se preocupam com as
 indagacoes pertinentes
 a busca do misterio da vida. Sao os cepticos, os
 pessimistas. Acham que como
 pano
 de fundo das accoes dos homens so ha a dissimulacao,
 a vontade de enganar os
 outros
 em beneficio proprio.

 Entretanto, olhe la para fora. O que voce ve? A rua,
 automoveis, asfalto,
 pessoas e assim por diante. O mundo da materia. Sera
 que a sa isso que
 existe?
 Nao existe mais nada?

 Agora, volte a olhar com bastante atencao. Onde estao
 as ondas do radio
 que voce escuta?
 Onde estao as ondas da televisao que voce assiste?
 Voce nao as ve, mas
 sabe que elas existem.
 Isso para voce tem credibilidade.

 Ha milhoes de anos um asteroide, mais ou menos do
 tamanho do planeta Marte,
 colidiu com a Terra e surgiu a Lua. Depois dessa
 colisao, a Lua manteve uma
 distancia tao precisa em relacao ao nosso planeta,
 que pode controlar o fluxo e
 refluxo das mares nos oceanos da Terra. O Sol se
 estivesse um pouco mais longe,
 morreriamos de frio e se estivesse um pouco mais
 perto morreriamos devido ao
 seu fogo abrasador.
 Se Jupiter e Saturno nao estivessem numa posicao
 perfeitamente correcta no
 sistema solar, a falta da gravidade de ambos faria
 com que a Terra fosse
 bombardeada
 continuamente pelos detritos cosmicos.
 Sera que esse excepcional sistema surgiu por acaso?

 O acaso nao existe. O que existe e uma fora
 extraordinaria, misteriosa,
 que tem poder sobre todas as coisas. Se voce pode
 acreditar nas ondas do
 radio e da televisao sem ve-las. Se admite que nao
 pode haver apenas
 coincidencias na formacao do nosso sistema solar. Por
 que nao admitir tambem a
 existencia de uma fonte de sabedoria e bondade que
 tudo envolve e protege? Por
 que nao admitir que essa forca
 esta alem dos nossos sentidos fisicos?

 Por ultimo, uma recomendacao. A melhor maneira de nos
 comunicar com essa
 forca "divina" e a oracao. Assim, se voce se resolver
 a dar-me um voto de
 confianca e
 participar neste maravilhoso programa, ao enviar sua
 quota de e-mails, faca uma
 oracao.
 E depois, aguarde com confianca e fe. Boa sorte!

 Cordialmente,

 Joao Carlos W.F.

Hello,

I am using Slackware 9.0 on my system.  I used the default install fvwm2.
My user $HOME partition was not touched during the installation. Therefore, I
had my .fvwm/.fvwm2rc from 2.4.15.  The fvwm session does not match the way
it worked on other installation.

Now I have upgraded my fvwm to version 2.4.16. The session still does not
appear anywhere close to what I had in the past.  The only thing I get is the
menu for the mouse buttons.  The FvwmPager,  FvwmAuto .....all have to be
loaded thru the menu.   The .xsession does not do anything either.

Please look at the configuration below and let me know if I am doing something
wrong.  There is quite a bit of legacy configuration in it.

Any help appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

# Mouse bindings

# First, for the mouse in the root window
# Button 1 gives the Utilities menu
# Button 2 gives the Window Ops menu
# Button 3 gives the WindowList (like TwmWindows)
# I use the AnyModifier (A) option for the modifier field, so you can hold down
# any shift-control-whatever combination you want!

#     Button	Context Modifi 	Function
Mouse 1		R   	A       Menu "Utilities" Nop

Mouse 3         R       A       WindowList
#Mouse 3	R    	A      	Module "winlist" FvwmWinList transient

# Now the title bar buttons
# Any button in the left title-bar button gives the window ops menu
# Any button in the first right title-bar button Iconifies the window
# Any button in the second title-bar button full-maximizes
# Note the use of "Mouse 0" for AnyButton.

#     Button	Context Modif 	Function
Mouse 0 	1       A       Function "window_ops_func"
Mouse 0 	2       A       Maximize 100 100

Mouse 0 	3       A       Stick
Mouse 0 	5       A       WindowShade

# Now the rest of the frame
# Here I invoke my complex functions for Move-or-lower, Move-or-raise,
# and Resize-or-Raise. 
#
# Button 1 in the corner pieces, with any modifiers, gives resize or raise
Mouse 1		F	A	Function "Resize-or-Raise"
# Button 1 in the title, sides, or icon, w/ any modifiers, gives move or raise
Mouse 1		TS	A	Function "Move-or-Raise"

# nothing for a single click
# Button 2 in an icon, w/ any modifiers, gives de-iconify

Mouse 2		I	A	Iconify

# Button 2 in the corners, sides, or title-bar gives the window ops menu
Mouse 2		FST	A	Function "window_ops_func"

# Button 3 anywhere in the decoration (except the title-bar buttons)
# does a raise-lower
Mouse 3		TSIF	A	RaiseLower

# Button 3 in the window, with the Modifier-1 key (usually alt or diamond)
# gives Raise-Lower. Used to use control here, but that interferes with xterm

It seems that you previously ran one of the session managers like xsm
or gnome-session (that started fvwm) and now you run fvwm directly.

There is enough amount of old syntax in your configuration to justify a
clean up (by reading man pages), you may also run fvwm24_convert.

Then remove SessionInitFunction and SessionRestartFunction and replace
them by a single StartFunction that starts all your modules.
Of course, removing ModulePath is a good thing too.

Mikhael.

 I expect that my subscription is complete when this mail arrives
I tried to build 4.2.16 on QNX 4.25, with the following configure options
$
//1/free/fvwm/fvwm-2.4.16/configure --disable-gnome-hints --disable-shape --
 disable-sm --disable-xinerama --disable-gtk-test

 After make started, the compiler stopped on libs/Graphics.c with the
 following errors

 Graphics.c(616): Error! E1011: Symbol 'M_PI' has not been declared

 I grepped both the include files for fvwm and those in /usr/X11R6, trying
to
figure what those ( macros ? ) could be with no luck.
Where should be the lost symbols coming from ?
I would appreciate any help

These should be defined in your system's math.h.  M_PI is =CF=80
(3.14159...), M_PI_2 is =CF=80/2, M_1_PI is 1/=CF=80.  You should be able t=
o
figure out any other constants based on that, should you need to define
them by hand.  I'm not sure what calculations pi is used in offhand, but
you should probably use at least 10-20 digits after the decimal point.

Finally i have a Dillo with tabs :)  Looks nice.=20

Is it possible to change the Font?  And a small bug: it crashes when
you try to add itself as a tab.

Hi,

I define some key bindings to some application, but they conflict with
those in emacs, is there anyway to screen those bindings out when I use
emacs? My fvwm version is 2.4.15.

Thanks

There is no way currently.

Some tips not to overlap your application bindings. Use 2 or 3 modifiers
from Shift, Ctrl, Alt, not one modifier for your global bindings. Use
special keyboard keys as modifiers. Replace "A" and "W" contexts in fvwm
bindings with "R". Use mouse (especially buttons greater than 5 if any).

Finally you may reconfigure your application too.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks, "R" does the job, though I still hope there would be support for
screening out key bindings for specific programs, especially emacs and vi
in the future version of fvwm.

I semi-solution to this problem would be per-window key bindings. I
think it's been discussed to implement this, let's hope it gets done.

I have commited a workaround to 2.4.17 and 2.5.8.  Should probably
be handled by the configure script, though.

Hello,

I think the fvwm man page is to complex for reading and searching 
through only one continous document. IMHO it would be much better to 
split it into several sub pages. E.g. each of the paragraphs like 
"Commands for menus", "Commands affecting window movement and 
placement", etc. should be on an own page. References could be done as 
links as in HTML. Also a good index about all pages (perhaps including 
the modules' man pages) would be great.

So my question: Does there exist such an HTML-issue of the 
documentation? Or is there a good tool that converts man pages to html 
pages including splitting it up into several pages?

Thank you,

Gert

You may try to write such splitting script yourself. Start with:

I totally agree. The manual is way to big for just one document.
Splitting it up would help to new users to get a better overview of
availible features/commands. I think this has been discussed before, or
am I wrong?

It was discussed before.

If enough fvwm-workers agree, I'll volunteer to split
up the man page.  Its too big for me too.

I think it is better to make a simple script which spilts the
output from man2html. So the original man remains untached.

For me the best solution is to use dhtml (with active "+" or "-"), not
multiple pages, i.e. to show only sections initially, then a user may
open and close any section as he likes. Or maybe the default is to open
all sections for small man pages.

Not very hard to add such dhtml to the existing html.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I would agree that the man page is quite a bit to get thru.  I went to
my local library to print out the pages and it was quite a huge task. 

I think what is hardest for me is understanding what all those commands
and options really do.  I still am not using fvwm as my everyday window
manager because I am trying to get thru all of the options to make it
just perfect. I know that there are other ways around it but if I cant
understand it, I cant use it.

Hi Dominik,

   I still kept on losing windows to other screen, and find myself
   scrolling in all directions to find it. So, I upgraded to 2.5
   and it seems to working fine so far.  However, in the new
   version, I noticed moving windows is different. I used to drag
   with mouse button clicked, but now have to release the button.
   I looked thru the man pages to see if I can get old behavior
   back, do you know if I can do that? 

   While I'm asking for help, another question. I saw TWM the other
   day, and liked the way icons were parked on the screen. Can I do
   that in fvwm? 

   Thanks a lot,
   Mukesh

While true that this solves the question of OP, the other answer I read
"clueless -- read man ports" also handles the question very well imho.
At least OP learns _why_ things work the way they do ;-))

Just to ad my two cents to this, I found the fvwm documentation overwhelming
and not terribly useful to someone trying to get it configured from scratch.
I am coming at this as a computer professional with a great deal of
expertise with computers, software, and programming.  I had to hack my way
through this by starting with an existing configuration, taking what worked
to my liking on blind faith, and tweaking what I wanted changed. I still have
no idea what many options mean exactly or what the ramifications would be of
a switching values.  There is really no easy way to figure this out.  It is
also no clear what the various modules do or how/why I would use them.  I
think some form of startup guide would immensly useful.

On the positive side, the support here is tremendous and my questions are
usually answered quickly and concisely with the exact information I need.

Not right, because there are only security updates in Debian 
and not new Versions... 

So there is nothing orphaned...

Hi!

As I understand it is currently not possible to configure EdgeResistance
on a per edge or even cooler on a per edge and page basis? Would
something like this be possible/hard to implement?

The reason why I would want something like this is because I currently
use DeskTopSize 6x1 and I don't want to be able to move windows outside
the vertical edges (up and down) only the horizontal ones (left and
right).

Regards,

Not quite true either. That depends on if you are using stable (woody),
testing (sarge) or unstable (sid).

Hello,

I have been using fvwm since 1996! It's a great window manager. It is
excellent compromise between speed and features that makes the best
choice of window manager for programmers and users who need to
make good use of random access memory. I also like the look
and feel very much, always have, and still do. I've been
using it for seven years now!

Happy birthday fvwm, and congrats on the good work developers!

Best Regards,

Neil

hi, i have a fairly bone headed question.  i am running xdarwin on my
apple laptop, solaris on a work station, and linux on my box at home.  i
use fvwm on all of them, but on the lap top my mouse appears black.  this
is no good as most of the backgrounds for my shells, emacs, etc, are
black.  i can't figure out how to change the color of my mouse/pointer in
my .fvwm file.  please help,
dave

See "CursorStyle" in fvwm(1).

BTW, if you use a shell in genuine xterm(1), then you can change
cursor colors/shape in Xresources...

  XTerm.VT100*foreground:  rgb:af/af/a0
  XTerm.VT100*background:  rgb:12/00/20
  XTerm.VT100*cursorColor:  darkorange1
  XTerm.VT100*pointerColor:  rgb:00/00/00
  XTerm.VT100*pointerColorBackground:  rgb:b0/b0/00

background colors)...

Hello all,

after ditching the last effort to use a "Destop Environment" on my
Linux box (XFCE, after trying KDE, after trying GNOME), I went back to
use fvwm. It seems to be in my way less than anything else.

Anyway, as I'm tweaking and configuring, there's some things that I
would like to achieve.

Is there a way to enforce a specific icon size? So that all the icons
align nicely. Some applictions have really big icons, and some have
really small icons (apps written for desktops that have some sort of
taskbar). I am not using an icon box, never been able to make
the icon box work anyway, and I'm not too interested in using one on
top of that. I prefer my icons "on the loose".

Icons show up at the bottom of my screen now, is there a way to make
them line up at the top?

If I raise a window, by clicking on the titlebar or window frame, it
takes fvwm some time to redraw the frame, titlebar and the application
window. Actually, it takes time for the window to actually raise.
Around a second or two on my 700+ MHz pIII with nvidia. (It's an SGI
230) Is this normal? Or am I doing something that makes it slow. I've
noticed this behaviour on other machines also.

Thank you all very much for any pointers.

Ian.

PS. my config is at http://apache.dataloss.nl/~ian/fvwm2rc
The machine runs red hat 7.2, with the stock fvwm2 rpm: fvwm2-2.2.5-4

I think an automatically parted document will not have the quality as an 
manually structured one. Also reference links will not be possible as I 
guess. Also all fvwm modules could be covered in this single 
html-document, too.

The only advantage of the currently existing man page is, that it is 
quickly opened (you just need an open shell) and that you easily can 
search through the whole document. But IMHO this advantage is not big 
enough to vote for the man page solution.

But ok, when I have time I will test the quality of the result of man2html.

The IconSIze style is what you want.  You need at least 2.5.3 for
it.

Look up the IconBox style in the man page.

This is because you have bound an action to the title bar that has
to distinguish between a single click and a double click.  Fvwm
can't launch the single click action immediately because it has to
wait if the action becomes a double click.  You have

  AddToFunc Move-or-Raise	"C" Raise
  +				"M" Move
  +  				"D" Lower
  Mouse 1 T A Move-or-Raise

This waits for a moment before raising the window after a click
(150 ms by default, but set to 750 ms with the ClickTime command
in your config).  Try this instead:

  AddToFunc Move-or-Raise	"C" Raise
  +				"M" Move
  Mouse 1 T A Move-or-Raise
  Mouse 2 T A Lower

works immediately.

By the way, I believe this line does not what you wanted it to do:

  Mouse 2 TS A Move-or-Raise

I guess you wanted

  Mouse 2 FS A Move-or-Raise
         ^^^

instead.

Bye

Well, if you wanted to print an html-Version of the document it would 
not be less...

btw.: Perhaps the best solution would be an abstract sgml or xml 
document that could be converted to html, ps, pdf and probably man?

This exactly is my current situation. Also I am missing the quick resize 
of an window via ALT+RightMouse as in KDE, icewm, windowmaker.

It never will be perfect. You should configure the basic elements and 
then use fvwm. You will see what is missing and can add this 
funtionality in a growing matter.

Yes, ok. But you will understand it better while you are using it. ;)

I do not like this idea. The loading of the page would take some time 
even if you exactly know which small section of the document you need. 
Also it probably will not work in dillo or lynx, etc. The html-source 
should be kept as simple as possible. Perhaps there could be used some 
simple, but optional stylesheets to offer different document-"themes".

Hmm... can't seem to sort it, I put

Style "*"           IconBox 0 1024 -280 -1

in my fvwm2rc, but icons still end up lower left corner. It's not a
biggy though.

Ah, figured it would be something I had done... or rather, the Red Hat
packagers, since I'm just tweaking the system.fvwm2rc. Thank you,
works like a dream now. (Come to think of it, I might have ripped this
config off a Debian system.fvwm2rc, oh well.)

Thanks for that hint. Hadn't really noticed it wouldn't work in the
corners yet ;)

Thank you very much.

                                ^^^^^^^^^

I guess you confused the order of the arguments.  Should probably
be "-280 1024".

Oops.  You need to specify the IconFill style too on the same
line:

  Style * IconBox 0 -280 1024 -1, IconFill left top

Hi there,

It depends on the smartness of the spliting tool and the
format of the document to split. I think it should be
possible to write a perl or awk script which can handle the
the output of man2html quite well and make different parts
of it. Reference links need to be adapted.  
In my opinion we need a tool for this since we can split the
files by hand each time.

That's the different approach but may be discussed.

hello evreybody :-)

i just installed fvwm2 on a RedHat7.3 box
when i open an X session with fvwm, i got the following warning messages :

[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from side.fvwm2.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from screen.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from modules.xpm
[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from shells.xpm
. . .

these pixmaps files were installed with fvwm2-icons-2.2.5-4.i386.rpm
(files located in /usr/share/icons/...)

when i open one of these files, eg with gimp, i got no problem, the icons 
look great.

can anybody help me ?

fvwm2 = compiled from fvwm-2.4.16.tar.gz

TIA

Hi all

	I'm trying to compile fvwm 2.5.7 but I'm getting this:

With Xft anti-alias font support?   no: Can't detect Xft 1 or fontconfig

	After ./configure. I already have libxft2-dev and libfontconfig-dev (Debian 
Sid), but configure failed to find it. If I'm not wrong the new fontconfig 
package dont have the fontconfig-config binaries, so if ./configure looks for 
this is no good...
	Is there something else that can be done?

This worked for me: Save this script as "fontconfig-config" somewhere
in your $PATH:

#!/bin/sh

pkg-config fontconfig $@

Hi folks,
I just installed FVWM-2.4.16 after using FVWM-1.2.4 since ....   oh,
about the late Neolithic.  (Well, OK, since 1993.)  I have settings that
are intended to produce the same visual results in both -- same border
width, same colors, etc.  My .fvwmrc and .fvwm2rc both say:

Style "*" BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, Color grey80/grey20,Icon unknown1.x=
pm

Inactive windows do indeed look just about as close to exactly the same
as I can tell without being able to run both versions at once, but
active windows ...  well ....  the best I can describe it is that the
window border and decorations look "blurry".

(See the attached gif file.)

After comparing the two closely, it looks to me as though while fvwm1
and fvwm2 are rendering the window decorations at the same specified
width, fvwm2 is rendering the raised shading very differently.

Is there any way to configure this?  I like the way fvwm1 renders the
border.  fvwm2's rendering makes me squint trying to bring it into
focus.

Yes, this should work in most case ... but here this gives:

Package fontconfig was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `fontconfig.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'fontconfig' found

:o)

and of course I run XFree-4.3 with fontconfig.pc at the good place
(vs XFree-4.3) but not at the standrad place.

Yes, fontconfig-config has been removed from the recent versions of
fontconfig. This will be fixed in a few days in the current cvs.

Maybe, I do not know. You can ask to fontconfig@fontconfig.org why
fontconfig-config has been removed.  Maybe to break the build of
certain software or because "pkg-config --libs fontconfig" looks
better than "fontconfig-config --libs" ... I do not know.

Running 2.4.16 on Solaris 8.

I am using MenuStyle * Win.  I have some three-tiered menus; I'll call the
tiers A, B and C.  Tier A may be posted via Menu or Popup command.  Tiers B
and C are always posted via Popup.  Once Tier A is posted, I can navigate
all three tiers by roaming the pointer -- all submenus are posted, and all
items under the pointer are highlighted.

The problem comes when I click on a submenu item in Tier A to post Tier B.
As long as I am roaming the pointer within Tier B, all items under the
pointer are highlighted and all Tier C submenus are posted.  However, if I
roam the pointer to Tier C, the items under the pointer do not highlight;
the Tier C menu items look "dead".  In order to make them highlight, I must
roam back to Tier B (highlighting still works there) and click on a submenu
item there to post Tier C.

Fortunately, an item in Tier C does respond to a click even when it doesn't
highlight.  It's just that the visual feedback is not there; it's hard to
tell that Tier C is "paying attention".

Looks like this behavior is not new -- I have a 2.4.7 setup that exhibits
the same behavior.

Can anyone reproduce this behavior?  Is there a configuration workaround?

Sounds exactly like the problem a friend of mine had on his mac.

It was caused by a bug in the Xserver and fixed by installing a new
version.  Fvwm can't do anything about it.

Hope this helps,

Actually ....   answering my own question, I discovered that MWMBorder
gets me *most* of the way there.  It's still not *precisely* the same as
fvwm1 (it's too flat relative to fvwm1), but it's close enough to be
workable.

Here's the updated .gif comparing all three (oh yeah, and with eight
days to go, Unisys can bite me).  Can anyone tell me how to get closer
to the fvwm1 border rendering?

If you use colorsets, you get to pick the shadow colors yourself.

OK.  Can you (or someone) briefly explain colorsets to me, or tell me
which manpage to look in?

Here is what I have:

-----
Colorset 1 fg DarkOliveGreen, bg gray60, hi gray75, sh gray30
Colorset 2 fg DarkGreen, bg gray85, hi gray95, sh gray40

Style * Colorset 1
Style * HilightColorset 2
-----

Each colorset specifies background, foreground, hilight and shadow
colors.  Experiment.  Try setting highlight and shadow colors to really
odd stuff to see how they affect the rendering of window decorations.

A good place to start reading about Colorset is the man page
for FvwmTheme.  Additional information is in the fvwm's man
page.

Um.....    What's the minimum version required for this feature?  I'm
using fvwm-2.4.16, and it doesn't appear to work.  From your mention of
FvwmTheme, I'm guessing I have to be running 2.5.something to use this.
Am I right?

Never mind ....  due to a stupid error on my part, FvwmTheme wasn't
loading.  And with the aid of Colorsets, I now have my window borders
looking pretty much how I want them.  And so long as I have FvwmTheme
loaded anyway, maybe I'll look into fropping a nice marble or granite
bitmap into the titlebars ...   :)

The whole idea of 'posting' a menu is to prevent that items from
other menus can be selected accidentally.  When you click, menus
go into 'posted' mode and only items in the posted menu can be
selected by mouse motion.  It works exactly the way it was
designed.

To save yourself headaches from another round of syntax conversion,
you'd be better off upgrading to 2.5.*.  The fvwm man page of the
new series says:

       In the 2.4.x versions a  special  module  FvwmTheme
       was  introduced to manage colorsets.  The FvwmTheme
       functionality was moved to the core fvwm,  so  this
       module  became  obsolete.  Some additional informa
       tion about colorsets may be found in the  man  page
       of FvwmTheme(1), although it is obsolete now.

       Old syntax:

         DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTheme: *
         *FvwmTheme: Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94
         *FvwmTheme: Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8

       corresponds to the new syntax:

         CleanupColorsets
         Colorset 0 fg black, bg rgb:b4/aa/94
         Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:a1/b2/c8

I'm running fvwm-2.4.16 on Solaris 8 and am running into the following 
problem:

There is one app that opens some new windows outside the physical screen 
area. I can't get to the title bar to move it into view. I've turned off 
multi screen mode and edge scroll mode and have set my desktop to 1x1 
like so:

EdgeScroll 0 0
DeskTopSize 1x1

Can I force apps to always open windows on the physical desktop and if 
so, how?

Thanks,

Greg

Fixed (I hope) in the current cvs. If you have time you can test the
next fvwm snapshot.

It "locks" the parent menu "Popup" item so that the popped-up submenu, and
any sub-submenus, have the mouse's exclusive attention.  Correct?

> When you click, menus
> go into 'posted' mode and only items in the posted menu can be

Hmm.  I guess I overloaded the term "post" in my previous post (ahem),
clouding the issue.  Let me try to restate.

I distinguish between menu-item "highlighting" (color changes when the
pointer is moved over it) vs. menu-item "selection" (some command is
performed when the mouse is clicked on it).  When MenuStyle is "Win" and the
pointer is moved over the items in MyMenu as configured below, the expected
behavior is:

AddToMenu MyMenu
+ "Item 1" Popup FooMenu  # hilighted: yes; selectable: yes
+ "Item 2" Exec exec foo  # hilighted: yes; selectable: yes
+ "Item 3" Title          # hilighted: no; selectable: no

So, a reasonable behavioral "rule" for the Win MenuStyle might be:
Highlighting is a precondition for selectability -- if a menu-item is
selectable (performs some command if clicked), it should always highlight
when the pointer moves over it, to "advertise" its selectability.

What I think you are saying (and what I am seeing) is that this "rule" is
not hard-and-fast.  If I have cascading ("tiered") popup menus, the initial
menu (Tier A) and the first submenu (Tier B) obey the rule under all
conditions.  But a sub-submenu (Tier C) behaves differently depending on how
its parent menu was popped up:

                           Tier-C "Exec" Item:
                           --------------------
Tier-A    Tier-B           Highlights   Exec
Menu      Menu             When         Occurs
Popped    Popped           Pointer      When
Up By:    Up By:           Over It?     Clicked?
-----------------------------------------------
XX        pointer moved    Yes          Yes     (1)
          over Tier-A
          "Popup" item
-----------------------------------------------
XX        mouse click      No           Yes     (2)
          on Tier-A
          "Popup" item

(XX=don't care)

Case 1 is in line with expectations.  Case 2 ("Exec without highlight") is
the behavior I find counterintuitive.  I hope I'm making sense here.

We have some Java apps that tend to do that.  FAQ 3.18 (FvwmEvent) works
great for us.

Try also press Alt-Tab to bring problematic windows to the screen.
If a window is WindowListSkip, it will not be shown on Alt-Tab, then do
"WindowList OnlyListSkip" (you may bind this to Alt-Shift-Tab like in
fvwm-themes).

Try also:

  Style MyBadWindow NoPPosition, NoUSPosition

Search for "Position" in the fvwm man page.

Mikhael.

hi

what is the correct config option to ensure that the full title of a 
window is displayable when that window is iconified?

i have a netscape window which has a title "FVWM - Mailing List" and i 
would like the icon title to be the same -- currently it just says 
'netscape'

thanks!

You probably already solved your problems. If no, read this thread:

I can't reproduce this with netscape (but maybe because I have 3.04).

If you mean real iconified windows, the icon title is not configurable
currently, it just displays what the application set for the icon title.

If you mean a module like FvwmTaskBar or FvwmIconMan, there are
configuration options to do this, see their man pages.

For moving windows where you can't get at the titlebar:

Key F7 A M Move

(Hold down the Meta key, press F7, move the window).

hi Mikhael,

thanks for the reply.  in my question i do mean real
iconfied windows but in my example i was using
netscape 7 but heres a simply way to get the same
effect.

can you try using an xterm/rxvt and at the shell

     echo -en "\033]0;foo bar\007"

this should set both the title string and the icon
string in the xterm.

when the xterm/rxvt is iconified, i would like the
icon title to say "foo bar".  do you know of the
style/cfg option to ensure this is the case?

thanks
ray

If you want to change the iconname use:

      \033]2;foo bar\007

I'm using 2.4.16 and I find I don't have to do anything special to have
the full window title mirrored in the icon title.  It Just Works,
whether it's a Mozilla window, an xterm (export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne
"\033]0;${HOSTNAME}:${USER}:${PWD}\007"'), an xcoral instance, XMMS, or
whatever.

My wife uses Windowmaker, but is frustrated at its lack of a decent
pager and is considering switching back to FVWM (which does so many more
things right).  Does anyone know if it's possible to make Windowmaker
dock-apps work in fvwm and/or make FvwmButtons work like the Windowmaker
dock?

There are no pbs, just swallow docks-apps in a FvwmButtons:

...
*FvwmButtons-WMakerApplets: (Frame 1, Size 64 64, \

...

Aha.  That looks like it'll do the trick.  The one thing I'm guessing it
won't let her do is codelessly add new buttons on the fly ...  right?

How often should she change the setup? If once per month or year,
adding/removing some lines is not hard. If she does this often, you may
add a layer over FvwmButtons that creates these configuration lines.

I may think about several solutions. Say, using fvwm functions only plus
some shell commands. Or maybe creating a new module in perl similarly to
FvwmTabs that similarly catches a window and swallows it, just tiling all
windows instead of showing one at time.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Not often, I should think.  And learning to write her own config files
will do her good anyway.  ;)

I just found myself wondering if it was possible to do a specific thing
in FvwmPager, which on reading the manpage doesn't appear to be
currently possible, and going on to ponder whether it would be a good
idea for a Future Feature.

Basically, what I want to do is conceptually quite simple:  In the same
way that I can tell fvwm that a window matching "Mozilla*" should have a
specified style, I want to tell FvwmPager to use different colors for
different windows, without having to change the colors fvwm itself uses.
Something like, say, this:

*FvwmPager: WindowColors * [colors]
*FvwmPager: WindowColors "*\%*Saved" [different colors]

My intent in this is quite specific.  I want to be able to make specific
windows (even more specifically, Mozilla download windows) highlight in
the pager, but not anyplace else, so that I can see with a glance at the
pager when a download on a different page of the desktop finishes.  So
far, from studying the man pages, I can't see a way to do this except by
assigning those windows their own overall fvwm Style with a different
background color.

Am I overlooking something?  If not, might this be considered as a
future FvwmPager feature?

You may use "*FvwmPager: MiniIcons" and assign some colorful mini icon to
mozilla, so it is bold in the pager.

There are thousands of messages on this list. Some may be remembered,

Hello list,

I use those beautiful, transparent marble-icons from kde-look.org and I
want a uniform design. So I assign a lot of icons and miniicons manualy.
It seems that this doesn't work correctly for ROX and Firebird.
The icons are correct, but the miniicons are still the those of the
application and not those I assigned.

Style *ozillaFirebird* IconOverride, icon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/48x48/apps/mozilla2.png
Style *ozillaFirebird* IconOverride, MiniIcon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/16x16/apps/mozilla2.png

Style rox IconOverride, Icon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/48x48/apps/rox-filer.png
Style rox IconOverride, MiniIcon $[HOME]/.fvwm/icons/16x16/apps/rox-filer.png

You can see, what I mean on the screenshot:

Best regards

Use the EWMHMiniIconOverride style as you use the IconOverride style.

Whenever a new window or dialog box
pops up, fvwm tries to find the least
covered area to place it.  I've had
fvwm setup to do this for years now
and have always liked it, but recently
I've setup a new linux box with a good
monitor and video card.  Previously,
I've always run linux at 1024x768 or
800x600 depending on what my monitor
could do, but now I have a massive
1600x1200 desktop and love it.  The
only problem now is that certain
dialog boxes that are created very
far away from their parent windows,
is there some way of controlling
placement of windows based on parent
child relationships?  I really like
how new and unrelated windows are
placed but it is realing annoying
moving my mouse clear across the
screen just to click the ok button
on an informative dialog box.

Is there a way to have fvwm use the
windows key as a fourth modifier key?
This would help me avoid conflicts
with other apps and prevent
complicated bindings like ctl-alt-1,
win-1 would be so much simpler.
Though I have a feeling this is really
and X issue, not fvwm.

I don't think so.  The described behaviour is commonly called

Counterintuitive maybe, but fvwm does not distinguish between
hilighting and selecting an item.  Thus, if items in the sub menu
were hilighted, their associated actions would also be executed
(dynamic menu actions, popping up their sub menus, animating other
menus out the way, raising above the parent menu, etc.).  When fvwm
is in "posted menu" mode, the posted menu works normally.  For all
other menus:

  * Mouse motion is ignored.  Items are not hilighted or selected.
  * Pressing any key terminates posted mode.
  * Clicking on any menu item activates the item, regardless
    whether it's the parent menu, a predecessor of it or the child
    menu.
  * Clicking the item of the parent menu that posted the current
    menu, terminate posted mode.

I don't see a way to change this without a rewrite of the whole
menu code :-(

If you know the name, resource or class of the faulty
application's windows, you can force them on a particular page
with

  Style application_name StartsOnPage 0 0, SkipMapping

(you may or may not want the SkipMapping style).

Loren,

Try "xmodmap -pm". This will give you the list of key modifiers.
On my box, windows key appears as Mod4 (Meta_L, Meta_R). Should be the same
for you unless you explicitely changed it elsewhere.

Then just bind your key to the modifier 4. For example:

Key	1	A	4	GotoPage 1 0

will map Win-1 to "GotoPage 1 0".

This is explained in the man page (oddly enough, you must look at the
beginning of the "Mouse" section to find modifiers definition).

Is there a way to have fvwm use the
windows key as a fourth modifier key?
This would help me avoid conflicts
with other apps and prevent
complicated bindings like ctl-alt-1,
win-1 would be so much simpler.
Though I have a feeling this is really
and X issue, not fvwm.

I downloaded/installed 2.5.7 but the man pages do not seem to be the same as
those on the website.  Specifially, the FvwmTaskBar that was installed does
not have the documentation for DeskOnly/PagerOnly, yet it does exist on the
web.  Has the tarbar not been updated?

I have:

Style XTerm SloppyFocus

AddToFunc RestartFunction
+ I Prev (XTerm) Focus
+ I Echo I am in restart

I expect the focus to go to an xterm after a Restart but this
does not seem to work.  After executing a Restart, either through
a menu or a key binding, none of my xterms gain focus.

On the other hand, if I execute "Prev (XTerm) Focus" via FvwmConsole,
the focus is transfered to an xterm correctly.

Am I doing something wrong in what I have described above or should
I look for the source of the trouble somewhere else?

I'd like to bind a mouse button (with modifiers) to a command,
and I'd like for the click to not be passed to the application
when the click happens over a window. Is this possible? If so,
I suspect it's in the documentation somewhere, but I so far have
not found it.

Thanks for the tip. The SkipMapping style was necessary, else it made no

That worked fine for Firebird, but rox has now now miniicon.

The fvwm man page repeatedly refers to CirculateHit and CirculateSkip
styles, but does not define them.  At least I was unable to locate
their definitions.  Would someone please give a brief explanation
of what these styles do?

I have looked at the man pages that come with versions 2.2.5 and 2.5.7.

The Circulate commands are described in the context of the commands
they affect.  Read about "All", "Next", "Prev", etc.
(the conditional commands).

By giving Circulate skip to a window, you can get one of these
conditional command to ignore the window.  You might use this for
a clock as an example.

That way, a command like this might be useful:

All (!CirculateHit) iconify on

I run fvwm on two nearly-identical machines.  On one, I have fvwm 2.4.9 
installed.  In my .fvwm2rc file, I have the line

Style "*"  BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4, NoIcon, DecorateTransient 

so that I don't get icons on my desktop when I iconify windows.  I also 
run FvwmIconMan as a swallowed process in FvwmButtons.  When I iconify 
windows, they still appear in FvwmIconMan, even though no icons appear on 
the desktop. 

On my other machine I have fvwm 2.4.16 installed.  Because I want my two 
machines to behave identically, I have used the same .fvwm2rc file as on 
my machine with 2.4.9, with the only difference being the module path, 
i.e. ModulePath /usr/libexec/fvwm/2.4.16 instead of ModulePath 
/usr/libexec/fvwm/2.4.9.  When I iconify windows on the machine with 
2.4.16, my iconified windows no longer show up in FvwmIconMan unless they 
are sticky.  If I delete the NoIcon from the line above, then iconified 
windows DO show up in FvwmIconMan. But they also show up on the desktop 
which I don't want!  

Has something changed in the way configuration files should be set up from 
2.4.9 to 2.4.16?  How can I fix this problem?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Best,

Marty

Here are 2 entries in the NEWS that look like they might apply.

Changes in stable release 2.4.16 (30-May-2003) [top]

    * Fixed displaying iconified windows without an icon in FvwmIconMan.

Changes in stable release 2.4.15 (24-Jan-2003) [top]

    * The  option  ShowOnlyIcons  now  works   as   described in   the
    FvwmIconMan man  page. It was accidentally  named ShowOnlyIconic
    before.

If you want the same behavior, why don't you install the same
release?

The ModulePath command shouldn't be used unless you have modules
of your own.  Fvwm can find its own modules since the 2.1.0 release.

I think the descriptions are somewhat circular (no pun!) unfortunately.
Here is what we read under the heading of Current:

      Current [(conditions)] command
          ....
          The Current command implies the conditions
          CirculateHit, CirculateHitIcon and CirculateHitShaded.
          ...

Thus we are told that the Current command implies the condition
CirculateHit.  Neither here nor elsewhere is a description
of what that phrase means.

Paragraphs corresponding to Prev, Next, etc., refer to the
paragraph corresponding to Current.  That is not of much help.

Thanks for the description and example.  I think I understand it
a little better now.  I will have to experiment a bit to see if
I have gotten the real hang of it.

The options are described for the "Next" command.  I managed to
screw up the cross references in the man page.  The options are
now described for the "Current" command to which all other
conditional commands eventually have a cross reference.

The command is executed too early.  Fvwm has not yet captured the
applications windows, so it does not have a window to focus.  Try
to focus the window *before* the restart:

  addtofunc my_restart
  + i prev (XTerm) Focus
  + i restart

Unless the focus policy tells something else, the window will
retain the focus over the restart.  This may not work well with
SloopyFocus or MouseFocus.

Currently, the click is always passed to the application for
bindings using the 'W'indow context:

  Mouse 1 W S echo passed to application

However, bindings to the 'A'ny context are not passed:

  Mouse 1 A S echo not passed to application

That does not appear to be true (in 2.4.16 at least); there's
no difference in behavior when I define the mapping with "A"
context as opposed to (for example) WSIF.  The click is always
passed through.

The code in "event.c" that makes this decision is (as far as I
can tell) not sensitive to the way that the mouse binding was
configured; it only cares about the actual context of the button
event.

A minor hack to that code to disable click passing when the bound
event is in the window context seems to work just fine for me,
though I'm sure I'm committing some great evil by having it work
that way. (If I knew how I'd hack in a real Style option and do
it that way.)

Hello,

I am slowly (very) getting to understand the fvwm2 configuration.  My
desktop is slowly looking the way I would like it to look like.  The only
thing missing is the wallpaper.  I am using Gnome 2 on Slackware 9 with
fvwm 2.4.16.

I tried to set a wall paper using GThumb and that did not work.  How do I setup
a wallpaper when fvwm session begins?

Thank you in advance.

and if you don't have "xv" installed, you can use "xloadimage"
(which has different options of course).

Hello again,

It is about fvwm again.  When I open some applications (particularly Mozilla,
Netscape, GThumb) my wallpaper and the application do change into some
psychdelic backgrounds.  Each time the mouse focus moves from the application
to the desktop or vice versa, the colors get swapped.  I do not have any
problems apps such as Acrobat or OpenOffice etc.  They are working fine.

Has anyone seen this behaviour before?  How do I fix these color changes in
display?

Thank you in advance.

Others have already suggested xv and xloadimage (also known with
its aliases xli and xsetbg).

Some time ago I experimented with loading root images with xv, xsetbg
(from xloadimage package), display (from ImageMagick package) and
Esetroot (from the Eterm package) and made note of strengths and
weakness of each.  Here are my observations for whatever they're
worth.

Personally I find xv most suitable for my needs.  Its inability
to handle transparent objects can be compensated by applying the
fvwm-root utility.  See the fvwm-root man page for explanation.

--- xv ------------------------------

Advantages:

  o can handle just about any image
  o is pretty stable and bug-free
  o commonly available
  o high quality smoothing when maximizing image

Disadvantages:

  o big and slow
  o screen momentarily blanks out when changing root image
  o does not handle transparency

--- xli (or its alias xsetbg) -------

Advantages:

  o very fast
  o handles transparency
  o smooth background image transition without screen blanking

Disadvantages:

  o does not recognize pgm, xpm, xbm, ...
  o too fussy; does not recognize certain types of jpg images
  o poor quality smoothing
  o buggy: "xsetbg -fillscreen file.jpg" doesn't fill screen for some images


--- display (from ImageMagick) --------

Advantages:

  o can handle just about any image
  o is pretty stable and bug-free
  o commonly available
  o handles transparency

Disadvantages:

  o syntax cumbersome, setting root image is not one of its strong points
  o not sure if it can do everything
  o very slow

--- Esetroot (from the Eterm package):

Advantages:

  o is fast
  o handles transparency
  
Disadvantages:

  o image quality of maximized images is better than xli but not as good as xv
  o occasionally messes up transparency
  o actually Eterm is supposed to handle pixmaps only, but it manages to work
    with jpeg files too

Thanks, Dominik, for the suggestion. I tried it but later I found
out that it was not needed after all.  I found the source of my
problem elsewhere.  All is well now.

I'm guessing you have progressive jpgs.  I think you will be able
to find a patch to fix that.

I find -sm works pretty well.

Depends on the image size, some need -fill, others need -full.

That's Netscape using a private colormap.
The best fix is to stop using 8 bit color.
Check your X server config and try to use 16 or 24 bit color.

I don't know what a progressive jpeg is.  I will have to look it up.
But here is an example of what I get:

% file ciscosplace.jpg
ciscosplace.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), 96 x 96

% xli ciscosplace.jpg
jpegLoad: ciscosplace.jpg - Unsupported SOF marker type 0xc2
ciscosplace.jpg: unknown or unsupported image type

Other viewers have no difficulty in displaying the image.

I have several other jpeg files with the same problem.

> >   o poor quality smoothing

The -smooth option merely blurs the image.  Applying -smooth multiple
times, as the man page suggests, makes it even worse.  A side-by-side
comparison with what xv does with scaled images can be quite striking.

You are right.  But it is not clear which images need which option.
I experimented with images of varying aspect ratios, but gave up at
the end.

My apologies for this off-topic discussion.

I am hitting a mental block in reading the section of the fvwm man
page on Conditional Commands.

We read:

    Next [(conditions)] command
        Performs command (typically Focus) on the
        next window which satisfies all conditions.

    Prev [(conditions)] command
        Performs command (typically Focus) on the
        previous window which satisfies all conditions.

My question is: when should I use Next and when should I use Prev
in a script?

For instance, let's consider the following example from the man page:

   AddToFunc MailFunction
    + I Next ($0) Iconify off
    + I Next (AcceptsFocus, $0) focus
    + I None ($0) Exec exec $0 $1

Why is Next used here?  Why not Prev?  What's the difference?

Yep.  Thats what I got until I applied the progressive jpg patch.
See if you can find it with Google.  The one I have is too old
to share.  (Nov 2001).

You might be able to figure it out programmatically,
by using convert to get the width/height but
I actually keep a file of commands, each image is displayed
with a hand tuned command.

Background image techniques are discussed every so often on this
list.  I think it fits in.

And of course fvwm-root, from the fvwm package itself.  I tend to size
backgrounds with a separate tool (if they're not the right size already)
and then call fvwm-root with the resized image. This lets one separate
the "set the wallpaper" from the image composition.

Hello all,

I missed your birthday! But anyway I wish you that everything goes
great in your personal, fvwm, programming and feline life.
Fvwm is a perfect window manager and I must say that you have made
a masterpiece of code. I know that it may sound selfish from me,
but please, keep making fvwm even more shiny and innovatory.

Thank you all for fvwm!
Jan Martinek

One of my favorite things about X11/Fvwm
is the idea of using focus follows mouse,
I've had my system set to do that ever
since I discovered it years ago.  Though,
in the effort to become more efficient, I
have though it might be more convient to
borrow a keystroke from windoze, though
there is something about that idea that
just bugs me...  Using alt-tab or maybe
something easier, like win-z or even just
win since I'd use it more often then
bringing up my root menu, to switch
between windows.  I've setup the following
so far:

Key Tab         A       M       Next (AcceptsFocus Visible) Focus
Key Tab         A       SM      Prev (AcceptsFocus Visible) Focus

This almost does what I want except I want
Alt-Tab to always go to the last window that
had focus, not cycle through all of them.
Also, in windoze, if you don't release the
alt key and hit tab multiple times it goes
to windows farther down the stack of last
window to have focus so Alt-Tab was the
previous window and Alt-Tab-Tab was the
second to last window to have focus.  Is
there any way to implement this with fvwm?

There is one bug with this I've seen a few
times where when I hit Alt-Tab, it changes
focus to a window on a different page
causing my page to change to it, and when
it does it, it is consistent.  Is it a bug
in fvwm, my code or what?  I have fvwm-2.4.6

Also, I'm wondering if I start using this
if I should switch back to click to focus.

Windows are stored in a ring internally.  Think of the focused
window as a cursor on the current position in the ring.  Next
searches forwards through the ring for a matching window, and Prev
searches backwards.  The windows in the ring are either ordered by
creation time or by the last time they had the focus (depending on
the focus policy).

In this specific case there is no noteworthy difference between
Next and Prev because there are either zero or one windows of the
given type.  We use Next in such examples out of habit and because
Prev might be a bit confusing.

It is certainly true in 2.4.14.  Are you sure you haven't got any
conflicting setups in your .fvwm2rc file?

Thanks, Dominik, for this very clear explanation.  Shouldn't this
be in the man page?

Now that you are at it, would you also elaborate on your parenthetical
remark "(depending on the focus policy)"?  Is there an easy way to
explain how the focus policy determines the order in the ring?

Yes, I'm quite sure, and I'm fairly sure as well that I found the
(very simple) code responsible.   Whether button events are passed
to windows is dependant on whether the window context of the event
is "W" (or no context), but not on how the binding was defined.

Hi all!
I've got some problem trying to install the fvwm2(stable version) 
averytime it says to me that I need to install  "libreadline.so.4"...
but I know I'vr got it becouse when I write in the console:
"whereis  libreadline.so.4" it says to me: "libreadline.so: 
/lib/libreadline.so.4 /usr/lib/libreadline.so.4"... So Ithink that I 
have to put the library in another  directory too, but which one??

thanx bye now (and sorry for my english:-)

Please post the exact output generated by ./configure related to
libreadline.  It may also be helpful to post the part in the
config.log file that tries to detect the library.

Umm ... OK.  I'm not sure I see what the root window has to do with
it, as my concern is only about application windows.  But thanks;
maybe I should look into running 2.5.x for a while.

Are you trying to install an RPM?

Did you install libreadline from an RPM?

On most Linux distributions libraries are put in two separate package.
For instance in SuSE Linux, the readline library comes in packages
named readline and readline-devel. The header files are in the second
package.  Install both and you will be OK.

Hi,

I have my desktop size setup for 4x3 and on startup FvwmPager starts with
4x2 desktops.  Also I have FvwmButtons and xclock on the desktop which are in
sticky mode.

When I switch to a different pane in the desktop, I do still see FvwmPager as
a small square, FvwmButtons as a small rectangle and xclock as a very small
rectangle.

Is there anyway to not show FvwmPager/FvwmButtons etc. within the FvwmPager on
the desktop?

Thank you in advance for any help.

PS - I hope I was clear and did not confuse you.

       *FvwmPager: UseSkipList
              Tells  FvwmPager  to  not show the windows that are
              using the WindowListSkip style.

Set WindowListSkip style for FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, xclock. (Style
FvwmButtons WindowListSkip).
Then tell FvwmPager not to display windows with this style (*FvwmPager:
UseSkipList).
Problem is that FvwmButtons, Pager and xclock will not appear in you windows
list anymore. Maybe there is another, cleaner way to go...

Subject: FVWM: FvwmPager desktops

Hi,

I have my desktop size setup for 4x3 and on startup FvwmPager starts with
4x2 desktops.  Also I have FvwmButtons and xclock on the desktop which are
in
sticky mode.

When I switch to a different pane in the desktop, I do still see FvwmPager
as
a small square, FvwmButtons as a small rectangle and xclock as a very small
rectangle.

Is there anyway to not show FvwmPager/FvwmButtons etc. within the FvwmPager
on
the desktop?

Thank you in advance for any help.

PS - I hope I was clear and did not confuse you.

Thank you for replying.

I did as you have suggested. My .fvwm2rc has the following lines:

# Styles for various Fvwm modules:
Style Fvwm*       NoTitle,  Sticky, WindowListSkip
Style Fvwm*       BorderWidth 2, CirculateSkipIcon, CirculateSkip
Style FvwmPager   StaysOnTop, NoHandles, BorderWidth 4, WindowListSkip
Style FvwmBanner  StaysOnTop
Style FvwmButtons Icon toolbox.xpm, ClickToFocus, WindowListSkip

and the last line in ConfigFvwmPager file is:
*FvwmPager: UseSkipList

I don't know if I did it right.  Is there anything else that I need to do to
not see these tiny images in FvwmPager?

You will need

read ConfigFvwmPager
in your .fvwm2rc.

I tried those lines by pasting them into FvwmConsole and
then starting the pager.
Worked for me.

Make sure the pager config is read before the pager is started.

I have the same issue, in fact even worse: on a 3200x1200
desktop the other side is a long way away :-(

I have long thought of implenting a solution like MacOS X, where
dialogs pop down from the title of the parent app. There
are reasons why this is hard in X, but I hacked up a module to
test how I could do it. See:

  http://cns.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/FvwmPlaceTransient.tar.gz

This doesn't work a lot of the time for a number of reasons, mainly:

  - some apps create transients that have the root window as owner
    rather than the real parent; we can't do anything about these

  - there is a flicker as fvwm places the window, then the
    FvwmPlaceTransient module moves it

  - there is probably a race condition between fvwm and the module

It does work for most galeon dialogs, which is about 95% of all
dialogs for me, and allows me to warp focus and dismiss the dialog
with the keyboard while surfing.


I think it would be a good idea to integrate this into fvwm to avoid
the last two issues. We could maybe fake our way out of the first
by having a config, something like this:

  Style "dialog_print"   TransientFor "galeon"


We could even have the dialog windowshade out of the titlebar, and
similar eye candy.

If I have time later in the summer I may try to implement this.
That's a big "if", I'm afraid :-(

Cheers

I am reading the ConfigFvwmPager in my .fvwm2rc.  After your email,  I moved
the following lines from the bottom of .fvwm2rc to the top of the file.

# Read config files for modules:
read ConfigFvwmButtons
read ConfigFvwmPager
read ConfigFvwmTaskBar
read ConfigFvwmWinList

I exited fvwm2 and logged back in.  It did not show the desired effect.  I am
running fvwm 2.4.16

I am trying to compile and install fvwm version 2.5.7 on Slackware 9.0 and I
got the following error messages during the install.  The build went fine
though.

The file "/usr/X11R6/man/man1/fvwm.1" is a symbolic link "fvwm2.1".  And
"fvwm2.1" was pointing to "fvwm.1" which is an infinitely recursive symbolic

Now it works fine in the fvwm 2.5.7 version.

Thanks for the help.

I use a system monitoring tool called procmeter3.  (Some of you may or
may not be familiar with it.)  I've had it set up for a long time to be
launched by fvwm when I log in.  From fvwm-1.24r, it worked perfectly.

Launched exactly the same way from fvwm-2.4.16, it still *launches*, and
draws its window properly, but none of the statistics inputs except for
disk-space usage ever actually report any data.  Killing and restarting
procmeter3 from an xterm fixes the problem; killing and restarting
procmeter3 from an fvwm function does not.

Can anyone suggest why this should be?  What does fvwm-2.4.16 do
differently that might have an impact on this?

I have been tinkering with windows title bar buttons.  One of the buttons I
have added is with WindowShade.  While reading the features of this function,
there are N, E, S and W to shade a window.  To test, I used "W"  now the
window is a vertical bar.

How do I get these windows back to normal?  I think I like the default
feature for WindowShade which is "North".

Thank for any suggestions.

If you windowshade to "W" you might want to put the title on that edge
too.  (The titlebar can be on any edge.)

You don't really need a titlebar to unshade a window though.
The windowshade command can be invoked from a menu, keybinding or
mouse press.  When its not invoked inside a window, you get a crosshair,
just click on the window you want to shade/unshade.

I got rid of the "W" and am staying with the default ("N").  I like that
better.  While on the "title bar buttons" subject, is it possible to change
the color of the window once it is made sticky?

Mouse 0 3       A       Stick

Right now, the title bar of the window gets stripes.  I would also like to make
them different color.  Can that be done?

Well with fvwm being 10 years young, I would like to suggest that the
mailing-lists be upgraded (to coincide with the occasion) -

 1. obfuscate/hide email addresses (we all get enough spam as is and
    there is no sense in making it easy for those bots to collect
    every poster's valid email address).  MHonArc fortunately is already
    used on fvwm's current lists to generate the html pages, newer versions
    of MHonArc though make it VERY simple and easy to hide email address
    and to scramble 'em (Jason, I can most certainly help if you like; its
    alot simpler than you think).  So instead of seeing 'USER@company.com'
    we can make it anything akin to 'USER _at_ company (dot) com' or
    whatever is deemed reasonable (sky's the limit).

 2. It would also nice to view posts real-time (or on an hourly basis)
    without having to wait for the cron job to fire-off at 5am :-)  For
    us archive readers, that might be of great help and interest.

Regards,

 - Nadim

If you're going to upgrade the lists (not saying you are, just
responding to the suggestion), I'd suggest switching from Majordomo to
Mailman.  It's faster, more featureful, a lot more secure, and has
built-in address hiding already.

(Is Majordomo even maintained any more?)

This is a side effect caused by a bug fix.  We are still
discussing whether it will stay this way in the next stable
release (2.6.0).  You can circumvent your problem by using a
complex function instead of binding the action directly to the
windows.  For example, replace

  Mouse 1 T N Move

with

  AddToFunc my_move
  + M Move
  Mouse 1 T N my_move

Yes.  Remove all IconBox styles from your config and issue

  Style * IconBox none

SloppyFocus and ClickToFocus order the ring in last-focus-order,
the other policies use creation-order.

Usually such problems are caused by the X server or the video
driver.  Try to find out more about how well your card is
supported by the X server.

Hi again
I try to compile and everything seems to be ok
this is the messagea the end of the ./configure:

FVWM Configuration:

   Version:     2.4.16

   Executables: /usr/local/bin
   Man pages:   /usr/local/man
   Modules:     /usr/local/libexec/fvwm/2.4.16
   Data files:  /usr/local/share/fvwm

   With GNOME Window Manager hints?   yes
   With GTK support for FvwmGtk?      no: Failed to detect GTK, see
config.log
   With Multibyte support?            no: Use --enable-multibyte to enable
   With ReadLine sup. in FvwmConsole? no: Can't find working libreadline
   With RPlay support in FvwmEvent?   yes
   With Shaped window support?        yes
   With Session Management support?   yes
   With Stroke support?               no: Can't find working libstroke
   With Xinerama support?             yes
   With XPM support?                  no: Can't find working libXpm

but I have some new problem...
when I digit "fvwm" as normal user it says that there isn't a file with
that name, and if I try that as root that there is another VW runnig.
I think this is all ok... but How can I start the pc with fvwm as 
default VM?? I know there is a file named .xinitrc but it don't exist in 
my home and I don't know how to edit it.

sorry for boring you with this questions but I'm only a student...
thanx again

Thanks, that's terrific!  I have yet another question which I hope
you will be able to answer.  In fvwm's man page, we have:

      Current [(conditions)] command
          ...
	  "Iconic", "!Iconic", "Visible",  "!Visible",
	  ...

There is no explanation of the meaning of "Visible".  I can think
of several different meanings for it.  Would you please clarify?

To explain my confusion, let's say my screen is 1024x768.  I do:
"xterm -geometry +100000+100000".  Is that xterm "Visible"?

Or suppose there is an xterm at the center of Page 1 1 in Desk 1.
Is that xterm "Visible" if I am on Page 2 2 of Desk 1?  Is it visible
if I am on Desk 2?

Rouben

A few days ago I reported a problem in which procmeter3 doesn't get any
data from any of its inputs if it's started from fvwm-2.4.16.  I've now
discovered another oddity: If I log in from xdm and start a session
running fvwm-1.24r, functions in both my IRC client (sirc) and my ICB
client (icbm) are able to successfully launch child processes such as
xterms, xcoral (a graphical programmers' editor for X/11), play (a
shell script to play .wav files), etc.

If, leaving those clients open, I start fvwm-2.4.16, I can still launch
xcoral from within them. If, after starting fvwm-2.4.16, I start a new
xterm and launch new instances of the client from it, or if I started an
fvwm2 session in the first place, I cannot launch xcoral from within
sirc or icbm.

The odd thing is that when running under fvwm-2.4.16, I cannot start a
Mozilla client from within icbm or sirc, but I can call a script which
contacts Mozilla and tells it to create a new window.  If I can execute
the Perl process to run the script, why can't I run an xterm, mozilla,
or the play script?

The only thing I could think of was that fvwm-2.4.16 is doing something
cryptic to the environment, but this doesn't appear to be the case.  The
following is a diff of my environment within an Xterm between fvwm-1.24r
and fvwm-2.4.16 sessions:

Can anyone come up with an explanation or even a *speculation* for THIS

baffled as to why it's happening.

"Visible" means that at least one pixel of the window or its icon
is currently visible on the screen.  "Raised" means that all its
pixels are visible.

I have written the missing man page sections in the mean time.

No, it's not visible.  By the way, the highest possible x/y values
in X are 32767; 100000 is too big.

See above.

Then you are sending mail to the wrong mailing list.

I recommend fvwm.  There is active support and fvwm can be configured
to look and act just like fvwm95.

Then you are using the wrong window manager :-)  Fvwm95 is a long
dead spin off from fvwm-2.0.43 and has not been maintained in
years.  I suggest you try out fvwm-2.4.17 with the fvwm-themes
package instead (see fvwm.org for detains).

Yes, I know I should have answered yopur mail a long time ago.  I
did not ignore it, but simply did not know what to do about it,
although I have tried many things.

The problem is that fvwm can not read the incoming events off the
Xlib input queue fast enough.  I tried various other window
managers and they all show the same behaviour.  Some manage to
mysteriously empty their input queue even under heavy fire by new
windows.  It is not clear to me why fvwm does not get enough CPU
to clkean out the queue while other WMs do.  My only guess is that
fvwm is too fast and becomes a victim of the X scheduler.

I am trying to a "X" as a title bar button to perform the function "Delete". So
far the only way I can do that is by using vector buttons.  How are these
buttons designed?  In the following sample:

ButtonStyle 6 6 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0 80x70@1 80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1

How are the numbers determined/calculated?  Is there a utility that does this?

Thank you in advance.

The man page describes how they work, but there are a bunch you can see

For the X effect, I am using this (in 2.2.4):

  Mouse  0  8  A   Close
  # Definition looks a bit goofy, but visual is OK.  A sensible definition
  # produces bad visual results -- go figure.  A pixmap might be better.
  ButtonStyle 8 Vector 14 42x42@0 72x73@0 13x10@0 75x70@0 70x75@0 8x15@0 10x10@0 42x42@0 75x10@0 8x75@0 13x80@0 75x18@0 75x14@0 10x78@0

I got the numbers by trial and error :)

Yes, 2.2.4 is an old version (came with Red Hat 6.2).  I'm not the sysadmin
here, and it works well enough that I haven't agitated to upgrade.

you can also use xfig to draw the desired shape and then use this script

Hi all,

A new version of FvwmTabs is available.

You can get it at:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

ChangeLog:

Implemeted buttonFont, titleFont, menuFont, & fontSelector options.
Much more clever resizing of tabs.
Mouse-3 binding on tab to release-&-iconfify window.
Fix focussing problem.
Make use of FVWM::Tk::showError().
Implemented dynamic configuration options - requires FVWM >= 2.5.8 to work.

SCoTT. :)

On my machine, double clicking the window border shades the window
in the corresponding direction.  Together with a fast video card
and animated shading it's a pretty cool feature.  I play with it
often out of boredom :-)

You will most likely want Xpm support.  Check whether the xpm
library and header files are installed properly.

You need to have /usr/local/bin in your PATH environment variable.
Check your shell setup if it isn't there.

  $ echo $PATH

If it isn't add something like

  PATH=/usr/locl/bin:"$PATH"

to your shell config file.

Just create a file .xinitrc in your home directory and make it
executable.  It should look roughly like this:

--------------------------- ~/.xinitrc ---------------------------
#!/bin/sh

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps
if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi
if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi
if [ -f $userresources ]; then
    xrdb -merge $userresources
fi
if [ -f $usermodmap ]; then
    xmodmap $usermodmap
fi

# start applications and window manager
xterm &
fvwm
------------------------------ snip ------------------------------

Note that the X server exits when the last command returns.  For
this reason, the last command must not be started in the
background.

And it's not a bad idea to=20

  $ ln -s ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession

then it's working too if you login with xdm.

Dear List,

** I'm cross-posting this with fvwm-themes as I'm not sure whether this is
a
fvwm or a fvwm-themes issue (I don't make a habit of this kind of thing!)
**

I have been experimenting with using session managers. Having read the
fvwm-themes FAQ, I am now using "gnome-session" (this is purely because
FVWM
claims to be gnome-like). I followed the instructions
about selecting the "generic" session manager from the menu, and also I
have
changed my "~/.xsession" file appropriately -- that all works fine.

My problem is that upon using fvwm, I am now no longer able to switch
themes
or update existing ones via the "Theme Management" menu. Fvwm just hangs.
I read up in the FAQ and suggested that I try this:

env FT_USE_RESTART=1 fvwm-themes-start

so I tried that, and that had no effect (in Bash version 2.05b).

Also, another slight annoyance I am experiencing (I cannot work out if it
is
fvwm or gnome-session, or perhaps the way the two interact) is
gnome-session
hangs for a long time after I log in via xdm. It takes about three minutes
for
fvwm to load and I cannot understand why. I ran a "strace" on
gnome-session
and nothing was wrong there. I had a look at gnome-session's
"--purge-delay"
and "--warn-delay" options, and they had no effect. 

Also (and I think that I might be getting slightly too abstract...sorry),
I
don't know how many of you actually use gnome-session, but in running the
program "session-properties-capplet" allows you to specify a list of
having
gnome run "non session managed" programs. I have tried to add three, but
each
time only one program appears in the list, and consequently gets launched.
Any
ideas why this should be?

Any ideas about any of this? I used to use "FvwmSaveDesk", but that just
lacks
certain features....

Thanks in Advance,

Thomas Adam

Hi. I've been using fvwm since I don't remember when, somewhere back
around Redhat 5 anyways. Great WM, not as heavyweight as some
of the others, and not as visually busy as the others as well.

Anyhow, I just recently upgraded the Motherboard in my system and
the keyboard.  The new keyboard has multimedia keys and I wanted
to used them to control XMMS.  I also have a mac powerbook and having
the volume keys work regardless of the application is very convenient.

Target System is RedHat 9,  FVWM version 2.4.16.

So i've done the following:
  Used xmodmap in .xinitrc to bind XF86AudioRaiseVolume, etc. to the
   appropriate keycodes. (and verified with xev)

Added the following to my .fvwm2rc:

Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A A    ALL (XMMS*) Echo up $[w.id] $[w.name]
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume A A    ALL (XMMS*) Echo down $[w.id] $[w.name]
Key XF86AudioMute A A    ALL (XMMS*) Echo mute $[w.id] $[w.name]

I was going to replace echo with an exec to execute a command that will
send an KP_Up or KP_Down event directly to the XMMS window (which
will adjust the volume).  As I understand the man page, the $[w.id] is 
supposed to return
the window id that the command is called on. There are two xmms windows, the
main control and the playlist window.  Each press of the button should 
echo two window
ids (and the window name).

If the focus is on the root, then the correct window ids  and titles are 
echoed:

  0x1400066 XMMS - song title info
  0x14000cf  XMMS Playlist

All is well so far. However, if any window has the focus then I get the
window id of the window with the focus -- twice. So if the focus is on
an xterm, I get two lines of:
    up 0x1200026 xterm.

I've looked through several months worth of archive and used google to 
search
the site, but I haven't found any help.

Do I have the correct interpretation of $[w.id]? If not, what should I use?

I supposed I could write a command that searches all windows on the root
for one with the title XMMS, but that seems to be a bit of a waste if it
is already there in the window manager.

Thanks in advance..

Tom.

Question: Is it possible to set ButtonStyle per window?

Specifically, I have defined titlebar buttons 6 4 2 to maximize
the window horizontally, vertically and fully, respectively.

I wish to change the visual appearance of a button when it is
active.  But if when I do that by changing the ButtonStyle,
the change affects all windows, not just the window that is
being maximized.

So my question is: is there a trick whereby I can change the
appearance of a titlebar buttons individually on different windows?

  All (XMMS*) Echo $[w.id]

is actually two commands and thus the $[w.id] string is expanded
twice.  The first time is *before* the All command is run.  At
that moment, the context window is the window with the focus and
$[w.id] is replaced by its window id.  You need to protect the
$[w.id] from this step of variable expansion by adding additional
'$'s in front of it (even for me it's usually trial and error to
find out the correct number of '$'s):

  Key foo a a  All (XMMS*) Echo $$$[w.id]
                               ^^^^^

It is possible but unfortunately quite tricky to do.  Try this in
2.5.x:

  buttonstyle 3 - mwmdecormax
  buttonstyle 3 allnormal pixmap foo.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 alltoggled pixmap bar.xpm

In 2.4.x it's a bit more complicated:

  buttonstyle 3 - mwmdecormax
  buttonstyle 3 active pixmap foo.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 inactive pixmap foo.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 active pixmap bar.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 inactive pixmap bar.xpm

I think you are making things unnecessarily complex...

Here is what I use.. works for all apps and not just XMMS! And I run the OSD
Mixer from osdsh .. so I get a really cool meter on the bottom of the screen
when I'm changing the settings!

Here are the relevant lines from my .fvwm2rc ...

#Sound Controls....

#Master Volume
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume A N Exec /usr/bin/aumix -v -3
Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A N Exec /usr/bin/aumix -v +3
#PCM Volume
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume A M Exec /usr/bin/aumix -w -3
Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A M Exec /usr/bin/aumix -w +3

#Treble

Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A 4 Exec /usr/bin/aumix -t +3
#Mute
Key XF86AudioMute A A Exec /usr/bin/amixer -c1 sset Master toggle

#XMMS Specific controls..

Key XF86AudioPlay  A N Exec /usr/bin/xmms -t
Key XF86AudioStop  A N Exec /usr/bin/xmms -s
Key XF86AudioPrev  A N Exec /usr/bin/xmms -r
Key XF86AudioNext  A N Exec /usr/bin/xmms -f

(you will have to change the Mute command.. I have two sound cards and use
Alsa)

Hello,

because one thing that I am missing in fvwm is the functionality to
resize a window by pressing ALT and clicking somewhere inside the window
(e.g. KDE, windowmaker, icewm do have this feature) I am thinking about
an implementation for this:

There might be 2 possibilities to implement this feature:

1) in the source of fvwm (this seems to be very complicated if you did
not work in the fvwm-source yet)

2) by using a configuration function in .fvwmrc. Something like this:

AddToFunc MyResize
# Find the nearest edge or corner of the current window
# warp the mouse to this edge or corner
# resize
# when finished, warp back the mouse cursor to the inital position
(maybe moved by the delta-value that you have moved the mouse while
resizing)

Is this possible? (I am using the CVS version of fvwm currently). Does
somebody have an idea how to implement this, e.g. how to store the
initial mouse coordinates? At the moment I could only implement point 3
of the pseudo code: "resize" ;)

Thanks,

Gert

Hi Dominik, thanks for the help.  Here's what I have now:

ButtonStyle 2 - MwmDecorMax
ButtonStyle 2 AllNormal  Pixmap 2a.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 AllToggled Pixmap 2b.xpm

ButtonStyle 4 - MwmDecorMax
ButtonStyle 4 AllNormal  Pixmap 4a.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 AllToggled Pixmap 4b.xpm

ButtonStyle 6 - MwmDecorMax
ButtonStyle 6 AllNormal  Pixmap 6a.xpm
ButtonStyle 6 AllToggled Pixmap 6b.xpm

When I activate any one of the buttons 2, 4 or 6, pixmaps on all three
buttons change.  I want only the pixmap on the activated button to change.
Is there a way to do that?

Hey all,

I've just installed RH 9.0 on my system.  Window managers like Gnome work 
fine.  Wanting to get back to fvwm, I've pulled down version 2.4.16 and
compiled it, no compile errors.  Configure showed:
FVWM Configuration:

  Version:     2.4.16

  Executables: /usr/local/bin

  With Xinerama support?             yes
  With XPM support?                  yes


When I fire up fvwm, whether with all defaults or with my own .fvwm2rc, 
all windows fire up and work.  However once fvwm is up and running any menu
I bring up is blank.  The background is correctly set to whatever Background 
is set to in .fvwm2rc but there's no text.  The "hotspots" are there and 
working properly, I just can't see what I'm clicking on.

Running fvwm -debug shows immediate errors:

Anytime the pointer crosses a window boundary this gets logged:

Whenever I try to bring up a menu I see a rash of:

Also, the buttonbox comes up but dies after a second.  There is no buttonbox
bark of any kind that I can see being output via debug.  The buttonbox is
sucked in via read /home/schultz/.fvwm/ConfigFvwmButtons and so far contains
merely:
*FvwmButtonsBoxSize fixed
*FvwmButtonsBack blue
*FvwmButtons: Columns 1
*FvwmButtonsGeometry +0+200
*FvwmButtons: (2x2, Frame 2, Swallow(UseOld) "Inline" "Module FvwmPager Inline 0 0")
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title Galeon, Icon wingdogs, Action `exec /usr/bin/galeon`)
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title XChat, Icon mini.ear.xpm, Action `exec /usr/bin/xchat`)
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title Close, Icon bomb.xpm, Action Close)
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title Xterm, Icon xterm.xpm, Action `exec xterm -fn "-schumacher-*-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -geometry 87x73 -sb -sl 4000 -ls &`)
*FvwmButtons(Size 50 50 Swallow(Respawn,NoHints) xclock 'exec xclock &')
#*FvwmButtons(End)


Anybody have any ideas or pointers on where to find out what the errors mean
and what's happening to the buttonbox and menus?

I think the problem come from the fact that RH 9.0 use UTF-8 locales.
If this the case there is at least two different solutions:
- Change your UTF-8 locale to an non UTF-8 locale.
- Use fvwm 2.5.7 (and report bugs if you have pbs).

Ahh. Thanks. It's obvious when pointed out.
  It was the fact that it worked in the root window that threw me
off. But then looking at the man page, $[w.id] resolves to the text
if there is no window bound at the time of the command. So
it gets passed as is to the ALL command in that case.

Thanks for the help.

Tom.

In a couple of previous message I asked about the possibility of
varying the titlebar button style per window.  I am glad to report
that I have figured out how to do it.  I use fvwm's "State" boolean
flags to keep track of each window's state.  Then I change the
button's decorations according to its state.  Works pretty
nicely, although the corresponding script is an ugly hack.

I have placed a screenshot in

    http://www.math.umbc.edu/~rouben/fvwm-screenshot.png

Titlebar buttons on the right side of the titlebar perform the
following actions:

   maximize to fill screen
   maximize vertically
   maximize horizontally
   window shade
   iconify

Each one (except the iconify button) acts as a toggle.  When 
the button is in toggled state, its color changes from green
to red.

Hi!

I'm looking for some support on a FvwmButtons configuration. I'll try to
illustrate what I'm trying to accomplish with some simple ASCII-art :-):

How would I setup something like the above? I want the FvwmPager and Xclock
swallowed and alligned to the left respective right.

As long as you dont necesserily want to have *a* FvwmButton you can take
two of them - one swallowing the FvwmPager and the other swallownig the
xclock. From the FvwmButtons manpage (v2.5.7):

"When invoked with the OptionalName argument [...] FvwmButtons will then
use only the lines starting with "*OptionalName"".

So if you have something like

+ I Module FvwmButtons PagerButtons
+ I Moduel FvwmButtons XclockButtons

you can provide two different configurations one using the *PagerButtons
and one using the *XclockButtons settings.

Randy, I had the same problem. In /etc/sysconfig/i18n change

  LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

to

  LANG="en_US"

Something to do with unicode. Maybe someone here who knows about
such things can explain why fvwm is having issues with UTF-8?

I don't understand how this would help me?

The part that I find difficult is to position the swallowed buttons the
way I want it. Setting the Geometry of the whole "bar" isn't that hard
(just a matter of using $[vp.width]).

My point it to have two FvwmButtons. One with geometry +0-0 (lower left)
and one with geometry -0-0 (lower right).

What is supposed to happen to the space between FvwmPager and Xclock.
Are there any buttons there?  Are there any gaps between the buttons?

If you want to use an UTF-8 locale you should use fvwm-2.5.7.
fvwm-2.4.x is not UTF-8 ready (but maybe if you compile with
--enable-multibyte but I never try and I think that in this case
2.5.7 is more safe than 2.4.x). The internals errors come from
something that I am not sure to understand. The file
       x_prefix/lib/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/XLC_LOCALE
contains a magic line

on_demand_loading       True

which is totally undocumented and cause problems with GC. The reason
of this line (I think) is that the core X fonts are not really UTF-8
ready ... (Xft is ok for this). Someone can probably clarify this.

Note that using an UTF-8 locale can cause various pbs. E.g.,
with perl 5.8, programs which manipulate strings can be dramatically
slower. What happen with an UTF-8 xterm when you remote login
on a machine with a non UTF-8 locale? ...etc.
Again, someone else can surely gives better examples.

If you didn't see your own post, then I'd guess there is a problem.
There have been messages on the list.

Simple.  Specify the number of colums you have and give an exact
position for the two apps:

  *FvwmButtonsGeometry $[vp.width]x64+0-0
  *FvwmButtonsColumns  64

  *FvwmButtons(+0+0, Swallow FvwmPager 'Module FvwmPager * *')
  *FvwmButtons(-0+0, Swallow xclock 'Exec exec xclock')
              ^^^^^^

Hello,

I'm trying to (unsuccessfully) use debian-menu with fvwm-themes. For some
reason, fvwm-themes bombs out trying, saying:

"E: config error on line (1287)"

yet that line I cannot find. Any ideas?

Hi all

I'm looking for a way to put images as background of fvwm desktops.
Some images are size bigger than desktop and others are small. In the
former case I want the program to adjust the image to desktop size and
for small images, I want to put them centered on screen an choose the
color of the remind area. Is there any tool to do this with FvwmBacker?
How should I configure my .fvwm2rc? Should I use an external program?
which?

thanks in advance and sorry for my english

Get the external program called "xv".  The command:

  xv -q -rmode 5 -rbg yellow imagefile

will set the root background to yellow and display the specified
image centered on root.  If the image is larger than screen, it
will be scaled to fit.

Tnx heaps and loads all who replied.  That was it.  I'm now using my fav

One quick question for learning reasons.  I was running down a way different
path trying to fix the problem.  What evidence pointed anybody to the LANG
setting fix?  I would never have thought of that, esp. with apps working 
fine.  Oh, and Olivier Chapuis had it nailed with the string parsing.  I've
found out that using UTF-8 makes even simple greps bog way down.

Tnx again for the help.

Hi,

me, myself and I wrote:

Does nobody know? Or did I write to complicated and misunderstanding? Or 
is nobody interested?

I could try to rewrite my question in a hopefully more understandable way.

I do not want to try implementing it if it is obviously impossible.

Thanks,

Gert

Is your $MANDIR (if any) points to the 2.5.7 man pages, or you are
reading the old (I guess 2.2.x) man pages?

Just for the correctness sake, Dominik actually meant these lines for the
2.4.x equivalent config:

  buttonstyle 3 - mwmdecormax
  buttonstyle 3 ActiveUp   pixmap foo.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 ActiveDown pixmap foo.xpm
  buttonstyle 3 Inactive   pixmap foo.xpm

It is better to use a complex function here instead of Focus, in this
function you may do Focus, Raise, WarpToFocus, uniconify and so on.

I didn't investigate it, but it seems that the Visible condition does not
work in the current cvs version, like in your binding.

But if you use CurrentPage instead of Visible, it works well:

  Next (AcceptsFocus, CurrentPage, !Iconic) Focus

As for all features you asked for, you may use this config in 2.4.16+:

  Key Tab A M WindowList (CurrentPage) Root c c CurrentAtEnd

  DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
  AddToFunc   WindowListFunc
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I Iconify false

If you don't redefine WindowListFunc, the default is to do WarpToWindow
too and it may switch to another page if part of the window is on another
page. You may or may not like this (your message probably says you don't
like WarpToWindow, but I may only guess), so first try just one Alt-Tab
binding above without redefining WindowListFunc.

For older versions (2.4.15) the syntax of WindowListFunc is a bit more
complex, see the man page for your version. CurrentAtEnd option is only
available in 2.4.8, so you should upgrade your fvwm version anyway.

ClickToFocus is not required, it is not even the default.

P.S. You use 44 characters per line in your message. Is not 66 to 76
characters per line more usable/readable?

Mikhael.

Can you please be more specific at what does "bombs out" mean?

What do you do, what do you expect to get and what do you actually get?

Trying to understand what you mean, there was a report saying that on
Debian (as opposite to Mandrake?) fvwm-themes/menu-system/fvwm_themes.in
file should contain string $lang instead of lang() in line 11. I don't
use neither Mandrake nor Debian to verify this.

It is not very complicated, you should just divide a window to 9 parts
(actually 8) somehow and warp the pointer to the nearer border. But there
may be some unexpected issues.

If you do this, you may add an option to all Resize commands, like
WarpToBorder, that is respected in interactive resizes.

Theoretically it is possible. You have all information like $[w.x]
and $[w.width] to pass to your script that evaluates a new pointer
position. You may even restore the original $[pointer.x] position.

The only problem is that CursorMove does not understand absolute
coordinates for now. I think it is in my todo list (somewhere in the
very bottom). But if you use an external script anyway, you may evaluate
relative coordinates as well (relative to $[pointer.x]) for CursorMove.

Mikhael.

Works exactly as documented for me.  Please, I you see a problem,

Probably because you use only one desk. Start fvwm with this initial rc:

  Key Tab A M Next (Visible, AcceptsFocus) Focus
  Style FvwmConsole Sticky
  Style FvwmPager Sticky
  FvwmPager 0 3
  Wait FvwmPager
  FvwmConsole
  Wait FvwmConsole
  Exec xterm -name xterm1
  Wait xterm1
  GotoDeskAndPage 1 1 1
  Exec xterm -name xterm2
  Wait xterm2

Press Alt-Tab. Visible is ignored.

Mikhael.

If implementation of this function is done internally it should work 
without warping the mouse pointer. You would do a remote border resize.

Is this required? Isn't the resize function normally envoked on the 
border anyway?

Do I call such a remote script via FvwmEvents or Exec or somehow else?

Sorry Migo, "bombs out" is an expression meaning: "stops working"

I see an entry for "debian-menus" in the root-menu under programs, but
that is all.

Ok, so don't warp to the border if this is not desired. :)

If you mean the new option, yes, it is required. Resize may be initiated
from anywhere and the current behaviour should be the default. Try:

  Next (XTerm) Resize

  Key F8 A M Resize

  Mouse 1 W M Resize

Using PipeRead if you want the script to build the correct CursorMove
command.

Hi, all!

I've bumped into somewhat of a problem when I Swallow XConsole in my
FvwmButtons. The problem lies in the fact that on some systems where I
use this setup the display manager (XDM) has already started an XConsole. So
when I use a this line:

        *FvwmButtons: (1x1-0+0, Padding 0 0, Swallow "XConsole" 'Exec exec xconsole -bg black -fg white -fn 5x7 -file /dev/console -verbose &')

...the XConsole doesn't even get swallowed. Now I know that I can use
Swallow (UseOld) to make it swallow the existing XConsole, but then I
have the problem that I can't customize XConsole the way I want.

So I guess what I'm looking for is a way to get the running XConsole out
of the way and swallow my own process, is there a clean way to do this?

Regards,

Looking at the existing flags to Swallow, maybe KillOld would be an idea
to implement?

Do:

  *FvwmButtons: (1x1-0+0, Padding 0 0, Swallow "XConsole" 'Exec killall xconsole; xconsole -bg black -fg white -fn 5x7 -file /dev/console -verbose')

If your system has no killall, replace it with kill/pidof or whatever
else your system has.

Or alternativelly use (Swallow "XConsole" RestartConsole) with:

  AddToFunc RestartConsole
  + I All (XConsole) Close
  + I Exec exec xconsole -bg black -fg white -fn 5x7 -file /dev/console -verbose

Mikhael.

Hmmm, I had to go with the alternative since root owns the initial
process, so I don't have permission to kill it. Although when going with
the second choice everything freezes (Wait:ing for something I guess)
for about ~30sec before I get control back. Is there anything I can do
about this other than pressing Ctrl-Alt-Esc?

I can't reproduce any freeze if I use the second approach (I started
xconsole as root before starting my minimally configured FvwmButtons).
Try to make it reproduceable and report this back.

In the mean time you may simply do:

  All (XConsole) Close
  FvwmButtons [alias]

Mikhael.
