Sorry for the 'me too' reply, but I explained the guy about the reply-to
problem and gave him a solution for his macintosh netscape (which he hasn't 
implemented methinks, since you had to remove him off the list)

The normal way of dealing with this (from a user's point of view) is to see
the original recipient of the message, chenge the "E-mail" field in netscape's
preferences (if using netscape) or whatever corresponds to that in one's MUA
and send the unsubscribe message as if it was sent from the address appearing
on the list.

Since I know you all know that, and it's all useless information to you,
please excuse my post and disregard it.

Thanx: Andrey

Hey, if you are a vector button designer, you should try this:

I have in the past noticed a problem building and installing XPM.  The
header file was installed to something with a double 'X11' like
/usr/openwin/include/X11/X11/xpm.h.  A manual tidy up was needed to
move it to /usr/openwin/include/X11/xpm.h.  (The library and
executables were okay.)

It's been a while since I was bit by this same thing.  As I recall, my
solution was to set LD_RUN_PATH to include the Xpm lib directory.
That way the test program configure builds will run properly.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello Fellow FVWM users,

I am working on a new look for my desktop, trying to get a MAC OS look.
The problem I am running into is having a titlebar pixmap but I want destructive
text. Meaning that the titlebar text would have a colored background and not be
overlaided with the pixmap as background.  Any suggestions? I am using 2.2.4.

For example

pppppp titlebar text pppppp

p = pixmap

TIA

Garth

The FvwmAuto problem is possibly fixed already - we couldn't
verify it yet.  Try a recent snapshot and tell us if that
solves the problem.

Can't say anything about this unless you post your complete FvwmButtons
configuration.

hi

i'm getting a strange error message with 2.3.13 the i notice when i exit X:

	[Fvwm][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
	[Fvwm][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 5, Error 7, EventType: 12

I noticed that the problem disappears if i comment out my ButtonStyle
settings, which are of the type

	ButtonStyle 1Pixmap name.xpm

the ImagePath is ok, and the pixmaps actually appear on the title bars, but
i still get that error.

any idea why?

many thanks

mario

Hello,

I installed fvwm2 under solaris 7. when I run fvwm2,

I get an error 

[FVWM][main]: <<ERROR>> can't open display
<hostname:0.0>

I have set the display variable and dont see what the
problem is..

I can run openwin successfully..

Also I installed fvwm using --prefix=/home/sam
option..
copied the sample fvwm2rc file to /home/sam/.fvwm2rc.

Thanks in advance,
-BC

Is the name of your machine "hostname"?  I'm guessing it isn't.

You should always tell us what version of fvwm you are using.
I'm going to assume 2.2.4, our latest non-beta.
I doubt it matters.

The display name gets to fvwm either thru the "-d" command line
argument, or thru X Library functions.  According to my 2.6 man pages,
the X Library functions use $DISPLAY.

> I have set the display variable and dont see what the
> problem is..

Make sure that $DISPLAY is "exported" (not just  set) before fvwm gets
invoked.

> I can run openwin successfully..

They are both invoked thru your .xinitrc?

> Also I installed fvwm using --prefix=/home/sam

How you installed fvwm should not matter.

sorry about that, guys, it was just a silly misconfiguration i had with 
WindowFont and IconFont... hadn't realised they are obsolete... hadn't read 
the man page properly. nothing to do with ButtonStyle as i previously thought.

I think that's not possible without writing a patch (which would
be easy to write because this is already done for monochrome X
servers).

The adjuration to be "normal" seems shockingly repellent to me; I see neither
hope nor comfort in sinking to that low level.  I think it is ignorance that
makes people think of abnormality only with horror and allows them to remain
undismayed at the proximity of "normal" to average and mediocre.  For surely
anyone who achieves anything is, essentially, abnormal.

Why are you setting display to hostname:0.0 instead of just :0.0?

The former will always uses sockets to communicate between the clients
and the X server, while the latter will use shared memory which is
_much_ faster.

It sounds to me like you don't have permissions to access the server
using the hostname:0.0 method.  I've seen this before (just the other
day someone was using the elm backgrounder and it kept removing these
permissions!)

If you must stay with hostname:0.0, try using:

  xhost +hostname

before you invoke the window manager.

  how do you run the fvwm? from xterm?

  can you run other X programs?

  what happens when you explicitly use -display option?

  are you running the fvwm locally or on the other machine - chances are you
do not have right to connect to X server...

  in the error message - does it literally say hostname or is there the real
(correct) value there?

  you need to give some more information...

Changing {Xmb,X}DrawString -> {Xmb,X}DrawImageString should fill the
background with the gc instead of "transparent" ..

I log in as myself and run fvwm2.

I can run openwindows by typing "openwin" and it runs
successfully..

the exact error I get when I run fvwm2 is
[FVWM][main]: <<ERROR>> can't open display
<bombay.office.com:0.0>

my hostname is "bombay.office.com"..

  it looks like the problem is that you do not have X running.

  openwin is a script that runs X server (using xinit) and all the clients
in xinitrc (system wide or ~/.xinitrc). at least on the sun box that we have
here.

  fvwm is window manager.

  to be able to run window manager you have to run X first.

  you can either run the X without all the openwin stuff and start fvwm
manually (just to get the feel of it and verify it works) or change the
xinitrc (either system or in your home dir).

  my openwinhome uses $OPENWINHOME/lib/Xinitrc or ~/.xinitrc

  check these files and replace olwm (or mwm or whatever window manager is
there) by fvwm.

  looking at the Xinitrc on my system I see that you can set the
$OW_WINDOW_MANAGER variable to override the olwm.

  check both openwin (it's a shell script) and Xinitrc for further info.

  (use which to find out where openwin is)

  hope this helps.

As root, when I issue a "Restart fvwm2" command, I am fine. But when
I login as a different user and issue "Restart fvwm2", I exit the X session
and go back to the xdm logon screen. Why is this happening?

The version of fvwm2 is 2.2.4.

One more note to be made, this is actually happening to the root user too.

*FvwmAnimateTwist 0.500000
*FvwmAnimateDelay 1
*FvwmAnimateColor Gold2

What is this module supposed to do? I have wide references to it's
use but I do not see any extra functions from fvwm2. The ModulePath
is point to the right directory.

Any help appreciated to get this feature working.

Thank you in advance.

When you iconify or deiconify a window, FvwmAnimate draws lines on the
root window between the window and the icon.

If you are using a 2.2 version of fvwm and you are using an icon manager
instead of the root window icons, you won't see anything.

In the 2.3 betas, additional configuration would be needed to get animation
with the icon managers.

If you have a very fast machine, you may have to increase the line width
or iterations.  The effect may be going by too fast for you to see anything.
Try a line width of 16 and work down.

I am using the IconManager, yet I don't see any on the FvwmAnimate features.
It could be because of the fvwm2 version 2.2.4.

When I try to restart my fvwm2 session, for the changes to take effect, why
is my fvwm session terminating?

Any clues please?

"Could be" is not correct.

Thats definitely the reason.

Someone else will have to help you with this one.  I'm not familiar with
your setup.

I can only offer personal experience.  Usually I make incremental changes
to my configuration files.  Sometimes (i.e. usually) I make an error in
what I type in or I would just guess at something which might work and
find that it doesn't (like what I was trying a while ago with switching
decors).  Occasionally this causes my login session to terminate and
return me to xdm or simply hang (for at least long enough for me to know
that I did something wrong).  Are you redirecting errors to a file?  Have
you tried loging into a virtual terminal i.e. not starting fvwm and
checking out what the errors tell you?  Have you tried using a simple
.fvwm2rc file to see if the problem still persists or if it might be
something in your present configuration file which is causing the problem?
All I can suggest is that you play around a little to see what the
behavior of the problem is.

Sorry I couldn't help more,

Tom

Hi!

I had this idea to implement a perl script that generates
the fvwm code to make a 'send to' menu. Ie. a menu, that 
allows the current window to be sent to a certain page or 
desktop. (Maybe also a 'send to and warp' menu.) Now, for 
this, it would be nice if the perl script could somehow 
access the current desktop geometry. Is this possible somehow?

regards,

Jos.

I found out why my system has been existing each time I restart. The fvwm2 has a "-d"
option, which I thought was the debug option. Wrong. It was for the DISPLAY variable.
For debug, you have to explicitly spellout the "-debug" for fvwm2.

Hi!

I have a perl script which produces some fvwm commands. The 
commands also include m4 variables. Now, I'd like to include
the output of the script in my fvwm2rc file. 

One possibility
would maybe be to use a 'PipeRead', but when I tried this, 
the m4 variables don't seem to get processed. 

Another possibility
would be to pipe the output of the script to a file, and then 
use 'include(afile)' to include the output. I tried this:

Exec exec script.pl > out
include(out)

but then I get some errormessage "bin/sh: not found ..."?
Should this in principle work in this way (and maybe then
I have some path not correctly set) or should I do this 
in a different way?

regards,

Jos.

When I invoke x3270 in fvwm, I get the following message in the 
debug log:

Warning: emulatorFont "3270-20" does not exist, using default font

In the past this font did work. Don't know why it is not working.
The .fvwm2rc has these entries, where the fonts are located.

FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/cyrillic/"
FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/PEX/"

Is FontPath required in the first place in .fvwm2rc? I did not
see any reference to it in the fvwm2 man page.

FontPath is not an fvwm command.

Look at the "xset" command for more information about your font path.

I am switching from FvwmAudio to FvwmEvent. FvwmAudio worked briefly but after
reading through the man pages, FvwmEvent is the newer replacement, I decided to
go with FvwmEvent. I followed the instructions in the man page for FvwmEvent.
My .fvwm2rc entries are:

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+                           "I" Module FvwmEvent

AddToFunc "RestartFunction"
+                           "I" Module FvwmEvent

DestroyMenu "Module-Popup"
AddToMenu "Module-Popup"
+ "Event (aka Audio)"                   Module FvwmEvent

# Audio Sounds
*FvwmEventCmd builtin-rplay
*FvwmEventDelay 1
*FvwmEvent startup /usr/share/sounds/start.wav
*FvwmEvent shutdown /usr/share/sounds/stop.wav

This configuration is not doing anything. Most puzzling for now is, how
does FvwmEvent know the location of the sound files? Is FvwmEvent limited
to AU files only? Does it play WAV files? I have explicitly mentioned the
sound files path and yet it does not work. What modifications do I need to
make to make FvwmEvent work?

TIA.

Sorry, I didn't want to send this mail.  I hit the wrong

that.

Did you compile fvwm2, linking in rplay support?  If not you will not hear
anything.  If not you can use any other player, like wavplay if you use
wav files or sox if you want something more versatile, with possible
errors playing wav files...  I think that rplay will play wav files.  Just
to see if it works try this...

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec SOUND_COMMAND SOUND_DIR$0 

*FvwmEventCmd myplay
*FvwmEventDelay 1
*FvwmEvent startup start.wav
*FvwmEvent shutdown stop.wav
...
*FvwmEvent destroy_window drip.wav
...

If you use FvwmM4 then you can use the following defines with the
appropriate path or just hard code it into the function above.

define(`SOUND_DIR',`/usr/share/sounds/')
define(`SOUND_COMMAND',`/usr/bin/play')

I've gotten two messages from:

a490143@hotmail.com

with the subject:

FVWM: MIME-Version: 1.0

that have come through the fvwm mailing list.  The message has an
attached HTML file with some fairly cryptic javascript.  I didn't
take the time to really get into it, but it looked like it was set
to delete files and mess with the Windows registry.

Makes me glad I don't use windows.  Makes me wonder why someone would
send it to the FVWM list.

  when you start the fvwm, redirect it's stdout and stderr to a file, then
examine the content of the file. you might find an error message that gives
you a clue...

  also, check the restart function (RestartFunction)

  another possible problem: I don't know how fvwm tries to find fvwm (to
restart it), but if fvwm is not in the path there might be problems... or
something along those lines (as I do not know internals of fvwm, this might
be completely off the track).

  I use win nt (and solaris via exceed (win nt X server)) and the script
caused some error in internet explorer. I don't see any damage (but I did
not really checked anything, just ran the antivirus, the system works fine
for now)...

  anyway, this prompted me to turn of all java/javascript/activeX etc
features in outlook... feel better now.

My platform:
Solaris 2.6, Sparc 5, head 1 is S24 (24 bit), head 2 is CG3 (8 bit).  Soon
there will be head 3, CG3, 8 bit greyscale.  I'm using FVWM 2.2.4, built
from scratch.

I'd like to know the method for specifying configuration settings based on
the display.  For example, I can do HGradient title bars on my 24-bit head
with no problems, but this (obviously) nukes the colormap on the 8-bit
head.  Furthermore, I may need to specify a 'shades of green' palette for
the greyscale head when it goes in.

So, in other words, I'd like to be able to use different configs for the
different heads.

This would also help me with another issue.  Currently, everything
specified in FVWMButtons comes up on each display.  Umm, I don't have a
need for three load monitors, or biffs.  I'd like to display the main
FVWMButtons (with all the goodies) on display 0.0, but only show the
window buttons on displays 0.1 and 0.2.

I've got FVWM integrated with CDE, with '*wmStartupCommand:
/usr/local/bin/fvwm2' specified in ~/.Xdefaults.  Login is handled by
dtlogin, logout is handled by a MenuItem calling 'exec dtaction
ExitSession'.

One message in the mailing list archives mentions using M4 for
preprocessing.  How exactly is this done to parse for separate displays?
Or is there a way to specify display-specific config options in .fvwm2rc?

Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.

I've looked high and low and can't find any way to do the following
(tho' I know there HAS to be a way to do it using fvwm2)...

Even though I use SloppyFocus/FocusFollowsMouse, I want to be able to
specify that certain windows, when they appear, HAVE IMMEDIATE FOCUS...
ie, w/o having to move the mouse into them.

Something like:

   Style "foo" AutoFocus [delay]

where delay might be a timeout for focus to return to where the mouse/
cursor is at the time that the window "foo" appeared.

This would be extremely useful for those of us who have become
accustomed to keyboard equivalents and shortcuts.

Sometimes I have "foo" windows come up that need nothing other than for
me to press enter...but, I have to go move the cursor within the window
that just appeared.

Thanks for your help (kudos go to those that actually know the answer to
this :^).

You can start fvwm independently on each screen with the
'-s' and '-d' options:

  # fvwm2 -d :0.0 -s -f ~/.fvwm2rc.screen0
  # fvwm2 -d :0.1 -s -f ~/.fvwm2rc.screen1

And so on.

Bye

Dominick,

Thanks.  I did read that the -s option specifies that FVWM should manage a
single screen.  However, I'm not sure this will work for me -- I've got it
integrated with CDE, and the WM is specified as a resource in
~/.Xdefaults .  If I run the commands listed above in a shell script,
backgrounding each one (&) except the last, and then specify that
shell script in .Xdefaults, would that work?

Or I suppose I could just try it and see, eh?  :)

And here's a somewhat related question.  Currently, with the dual head, I
just have one fvwm2 specified as the WM.  When it runs, it spawns off two
fvwm2's, like so:

     hal   386   377  0   Feb 06 ?        0:10 /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 -s
     hal   387   386  0   Feb 06 ?        0:10 /usr/local/bin/fvwm2 -s

Does FVWM have code that detects multiple-display systems, and
automatically spawns these off?  How is this handled in multi-head
systems where CDE is not in use?  I'm just curious as to how that works.

Thanks again for your help.

A better way, rather than starting one for each screen manually, is to use
M4 (or perhaps CPP) to preprocess the file. For your case, where you want to
do things based on colour depth, it works even better because you can
configure by depth rather than by screen number. The macro CLASS will be the
screen type (in your case, TrueColor or PseudoColor, depending on the
screen); the macro SCREEN will be the screen number; the macro COLOR will be
Yes or No, as appropriate, and the macro PLANES will be the depth (i.e. 8 or
24) - see the FvwmM4 manual page for a complete list. So, in M4, you can do
things like:

  ifelse(CLASS,'TrueColor','
    x-your-root-loader -background pretty-24-bit-picture
  ','
    xsetroot -solid blue4')
  ifelse(SCREEN,'0','
    Module FvwmButtons-S0   # a symbolic link to FvwmButtons; use
                            # *FvwmButtons-S0 to configure
  ','
    Module FvwmButtons-S1
  ')

(Note, by the way, that you should supply -m4-squote and -m4-equote to the
fvwm invocation, since using the default quotes, as above, will probably not
work; I use curly braces {}.)

For a somewhat more complicated example, here's a snippet of my .fvwm2rc for
M4:

# TrueColor/Psuedo color configuration
ifelse(CLASS,{TrueColor},{
 # - can use fancy, colour-intensive stuff
 define({ACTIVE_PIXMAP},{Bluegrain.xpm})
 define({INACTIVE_PIXMAP},{greenleather.xpm})

 define({TITLE_ACTIVE_PIXMAP},{MARBLE_SMOKE.xpm})
 define({TITLE_INACTIVE_PIXMAP},{GreySlate.xpm})

 define({GRADIENT},{MenuFace DGradient 128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white})
 define({SIDEPIC},{SidePic side.fvwm2.xpm, SideColor Black })

 define({PICGLOB},{*.jpeg})
},{
 # presumably pseudo-colour. Keep it down, keep it down.

Fvwm looks at the number of displays and spawns a new instance for each.
However, it does keep some track of each instance; specifically, if you do a
'quit' in this case, it will terminate all instances. Conversely, if you run
individual copies with -s for each screen, quitting one won't quit the othe=
r.

You can force it to quit on one just screen when it automatically spawns -
look for the QuitScreen command (code I submitted way back for 2.0.46 or
thereabouts).

Hello all - I'm looking for some advice to solving a minor annoyance
between xemacs and fvwm2. This might be a xemacs problem, but I thought
I'd try here first.

I'm running fvwm2 (see below for exact version) with multiple desktops.
I run xemacs with gnuserve, and I then use gnuclient from a fvwm2
menu to spawn new xemacs frames. What I would like is the new xemacs
frame I create to always appear on the current desktop. What happens
though is that the created frame always appears on a desktop with an
existing xemacs frame instead of the current desktop.

This doesn't appear to be a StartsOnDesk problem because (1) if I have
no current xemacs frames and I create one it appears on the current
desktop, (2) if I have one xemacs frame on desktop N, a new frame will
always appear on desktop N, no matter what N is. If I have multiple
xemacs frames already created on multiple desktops, a new frame will
always appear on one of those desktops - I haven't quite figured out
the logic as to where, but it seems to be consistantly with a certain
existing frame until I destroy it, then it shifts to another frame.

I have no StartsOnDesk for xemacs in my .fvwmrc2.

The only similar bug I found in the list archives was that xemacs 21.1.7
created new frames with the name 'shell' initially and that caused
StartsonDesk to map it unexpectedly. But that bug appears to be fixed in
21.1.8 (which is what I'm running).

So, anyone have any advice?

Thanks,

Von

p.s. - I'm running:

FYI:

I forwarded this information onto our local virus team and they found
that the virus is virtually unknown by the antivirus establishment (at
least as of yesterday morning).  They did, however, discover that it
has been reported on alt.comp.virus and is called
W32Script/Unicle.worm.  Apparently, it copies various system files to
a public ftp site, appends itself to all outgoing email messages and
possibly damages the registry... if you're using Microsoft Outlook on
a Microsoft Windows platform AND you don't have the security features
set correctly.

Naturally, I'm not going to disclose the status of our local efforts
to deal with this virus, but I thought the rest of you, especially
Erik, might want to know that there was no antivirus software that can
detect it as of yesterday and that it can send confidential
information to a public site.  If there is a virus software update
available for it in the future, you should be able to find it under
the keyword "Unicle".

You could set up FvwmEvent to move newly created Xemacs windows
to the current desk.  I don't have the correct syntax handy
right now, but let FvwmEvent execute something like

  Current (emacs*) movetodesk ...

when new windows are mapped.

The adjuration to be "normal" seems shockingly repellent to me; I see neither
hope nor comfort in sinking to that low level.  I think it is ignorance that
makes people think of abnormality only with horror and allows them to remain
undismayed at the proximity of "normal" to average and mediocre.  For surely
anyone who achieves anything is, essentially, abnormal.

I don't believe this will actually work without hacking FvwmEvent.
As far as I can tell, by both experimentation and looking at the
source, *FvwmEvent and *FvwmEvent both only take a single whitespace
delimited token for command and action, so the most you can have is
two words in any given command.

In other words, with the following everything after "Current" is
discarded by FvwmEvent:

*FvwmEvent add_window Current (emacs*) MoveToDesk 0

I don't believe it would be difficult to modify FvwmEvent.c so
that it uses the whole string instead of just the next token,
however I also have the problem that the xemacs frames don't receive
focus automatically. I understand the 2.3.x fvwm2 has GrabFocus, but
I haven't found any way in 2.2.x to achieve this yet.

Try:

*FvwmEvent add_window "Current (emacs*) MoveToDesk 0"

Hi,

Others on this list would certainly know better than I, but you should be
able to do this either by using quotes or by making another function which
is executed by FvwmEvent.  For example, what about doing the same thing
which is done to get FvwmEvent to handle playing audio.

You can make the XEmacs windows 'ClickToFocus'.  Then they will
receive focus as soon as they are mapped.

Many thanks to those who pointed out that I could quote the event string
or use a function. Both methods seem to work.

The one other thing I had to figure out that Current doesn't
recognize the added window as the current window (even with
ClickToFocus in the Style).

For now I've replaced "Current (emacs*)" with "Next (emacs*)" and
it seems to work (though I won't be surprised if at some point it
grabs the wrong xemacs frame).

Anyways here is the solution I'm using in case anyone is interested
now or in the future:

# Start FvwmEvent at some point...

# This is needed so we don't change desktop when the frame appears
Style "emacs*"		SkipMapping

# If I use Current here instead of Next nothing happens
# If I remove the "Next (emacs*)" then all new windows
# get moved to the current desk
AddToFunc AddWindowFunc	"I" Next (emacs*) MoveToDesk 0

*FvwmEvent add_window AddWindowFunc


Thanks to all!

Von

Hello.

I'd like to use these two modules, however, it won't seem to work under:

fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.1.7 compiled on Feb 10 2000 at 17:01:21

Is this even possible?  If so, what should I add to my .fvwm2rc file?  If
not, is there any chance that a developer would add this?

Thanks.
Olivier

FvwmAnimate and FvwmWinList only work together in the latest betas.
You would need to install all of fvwm.  The modules certainly won't
work with fvwm 2.1.7.

The man pages describe what you need to do.

Ok. I may do this anyway. I did discover that Animate will work with
FvwmIconMan... similar in functionality.

Hrm. Yeah. I believe in RTFM too.  ;-)

So, admittedly, this is a stupid problem...

Why is this happening:

checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error: can
not run test program while cross compiling

Trying to complie version:
fvwm-2.2.4

I have tried changing the various instances of setvbuf= yes;, to setvbuf=
no;.  This method worked with earlier versions of Fvwm where I saw this
problem, but it's not happening here...

Thanks.

Your compiler is not installed correctly, or something.  Configure
thinks you're cross-compiling, which you're not: that means that it
couldn't get your compiler to work.

If you look back up through configure you'll see it decide you're
cross-compiling.

  ofb> Trying to complie version:
  ofb> fvwm-2.2.4

OK, but you didn't specify your OS.

It's probably your C++ compiler that it's having problems with; try
re-running configure with --without-cxx (remove the config.cache file
first).

Please read the INSTALL.fvwm file; it talks about these kinds of
problems.

I don't like titles on my windows, so I have a:

and it removes them all. I'd like to be able to hit a key (like F2) and
have it toggle the titlebar on the window I've got currently
focused.

Any suggestions on how I might go around to doing this?

mm maybe using FvwmEvent it is even possible to make the title 
appear when a window is focused..

Hi!

With FvwmCommand it's possible to pipe information about 
windows (like the window's position) into a shell script.
Now my question: is it also possible to get other types 
fvwm-information, like the screen width, or the desktop size?

regards,

Jos.

You never said what version you where using so I'll assume one of the latest
as this works.

Bind this to a key or menu or whatever you wish 
Pick Style $n Title    or 
Pick Style $n NoTitle

I'm using 2.3.12, and this works excellently!

Another poster suggested using FvwmEvent to give the focused window a bar,
which is a pretty cool idea :) I'll try to get that working.

For the time being, I don't think you can't get that, except by some
really godawful hacks:

AddToFunc _SendScreenSize
+ I GotoPage 1 1
+ I FvwmPipe "Screen $x $y" # I don't use FvwmPipe, but you get the idea
+ I GotoPage prev

N.B. this only works if your DesktopSize is at least 2x2. Whatever
parses the screensize should be on the lookout for $x or $y == 0.

A much better approach would be to introduce two more builtin
variables like Vx and Vy which would be the dimensions of the screen.
Having access to raw $x and $y is less helpful since they don't tell
you the page you're on. See the man page if you don't know what $x and
$y return.

Hello,

I would like an aplication named xyz to start below the focused window
but also above every other window. I have been told I can do this with
layers but it seems to me that the man page is not very clear on how
layers work. Can someone tell me how layers work and how I can accomplish
the xyz task mentioned above?

Thanks,

Neil

Hello once more,

  =B9) how can I get the horizontal lines in all title bars as
     I get them for FvwmButtons title bar ?
  =B2) can I change the border and handle width when a window looses
     focus? -- e.g. handle and border width to 0 if the window
     has no focus.
  =B3) I like `focus follows mouse'. But: is there a focus policy
     which does the following:  If I move the pointer outside a
     window (to the root window (background)) the window where
     the pointer was in just before should keep focused as long
     as the pointer gets not moved to another window. This is
     the way wmx does.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Hello,

is there something like a StaysOnBottom option, means I want
a window (e.g. FvwmButtons) always staying below all other
windows and even ignore Raise events.

I've for example

Key Down A M Lower      
Key Up   A M Raise

and I want no window lowered below the FvwmButtons.

Try:
Style * NoButton 2, NoButton 4, NoButton 6

See the man page "Style" section for more information.

That's called StipledTitle, as in:

Style * StipledTitle

Stipled is misspelled, but I think there's some strange historical
reason for that. It may have been a GlobalOpt before. And it may only
have become an option in the latest betas.

In the latest betas you can. I'd hang out and wait for 2.4 for that.

The man page keeps getting bigger, but it's better organized these
days. Everything you've asked about is in the man page.

The man page mentions StipledTitles under GlobalOptions.
But it does not tell anywhere what this options means.
There's no Style StipledTitles at least in my fvwm2 which
comes with the latest debian potato.
But giving the keyword did help anyway.

Hello again,

there's yet another issue:
I had to change a line in my vim xpm icon files

- "# c None",
+ "# c None s mask",

to get the icons shaped.
The xpm specs say that `None' is `transparent'.
Why does fvwm not shape xpm icons if they simply
contain the color `None' ?

Look for something like:

Mouse 3 R C Popup Window-Operations

in your .fvwm2rc and then look for the definition
of Window-Operations or whatever appears there.
This should be something like:

AddToMenu Window-Operations "Window Operations"         Title
+                           ""                          Nop

Good question. To be honest I don't know. Try man fvwm2.

I have a similar problem: when I iconize xconsole at startup it ends
up below FvwmButtons and since FvwmButtons is StaysOnBottom I cannot
get the xconsole icon to get out from below it.

> and even ignore Raise events.

Try:

Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus

That way it will be impossible to raise FvwmButtons.

You can either remove all lines that bind keys or mouse buttons
to these title buttons ('Key' and 'Mouse' command), or you can
disable them explicitly thie the NoButton style, e.g.

  Style * NoButton 1, NoButton 2, NoButton 4

I've never thought about spelling when I made the former
GlobalOpt a style.  I see no reason why we should keep
the typo.  I'll fix it.

Question 3.8 in the FAQ explains it.

Fvwm doesn't interpret xpm files.  It must be a bug in your
xpm package.

  check how the FvwmButtons gets its title bar - you will see some =

Hello,

I would like to know how to identify the name, class, and resource
attached to an application so that I may use them correctly with
the Fvwm Style option in the configuration file.

It seems to me that sometimes these are listed in man pages but unfortunately
not all applications come with man pages and info files or other 
documentation.
There must be a better way to find out the name, class, and resource. 

What are these for Netscape for instance?

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

The FvwmIdent module was created for exactly this purpose (among
others).

I don't think there's a reliable way to do this with layers.
If you don't mind the flichering you can youe FvwmEvent:
Whenever a new window is mapped, execute

  Current Raise

This will bring the focused window back to the top.

well, I got the latest source from cvs noticing that the man
page grew from 4000 (as it comes with debian) to over 6000
lines :-)
But I still didn't find out howto get zero with border
when the window looses focus.

btw. I've a vim syntax file
    http://www.zellner.org/vim/syntax/fvwmcpp.vim
which does correct syn highlighting for FvwmCpp config files.

You can't really do this.  You could let FvwmEvent modify
the style when windows are focused/unfocused, but that
will apply to all matching windows, not just the window
that has lost/acquired focus.  I'm planning to implement
state dependent styles after the 2.4 release.

I'm trying to add title bars to my windows when they get focus, and remove
them when they leave focus, I have this so far:

*FvwmEvent focus_change my_focusevent
AddToFunc my_focusevent "I" WindowId $0 Style $n Title

Now the title gets added, but I'm not sure how to find out which window=
 was
just unfocused so I can remove the titles. I'm using Sloppyfocus btw.

How can you change the style of a window (window name basis is ok until=
 2.4
allows me to avoid that) when it unfocuses? I got the focus part, I can't
get the unfocus part.

The 'Prev' command should select the window last window that
had the focus.

aah. great. exactly what I'd need. Remove Borders and Titles from
windows which don't have input focus.
If you manage to get this working would you mind sending me
the setup ? -- That would be great.

*FvwmEvent        focus_change my_focusevent
AddToFunc my_focusevent "I" Current (!Fvwm*) Style $n Title
+                       "I" Prev (!Fvwm*) Style $n NoTitle

I don't want my Fvwm* windows having titles ever.

This is pretty annoying tho, since it moves the windows up and down :(

It'd be much cooler to be able to move the windows up and show the border,
but that flickers really bad :(

Anyone have any ideas on toggling the titlebars without moving the actual
window (just moving the windowmanager controled parent)?

great, this works well :)

So now everything is almost working with titles showing only on the focused
window.=20
Only thing left is that I'd like to just have the title show on the window
that has the focus, not any window with that same name. any suggestions?
Dominik hinted he might be doing something to allow Styles per window, if=
 I
didnt misunderstand him. Is this possible in the latest snapshots?

No way.  This is a future enhancement that won't make it into
the next stable release.

How about unstable snapshots or even cvs?

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi there,

I have two computers at my desk, two monitors, and a flakey Belkin
OmniCube to duplex out my keyb/mouse to both boxes. One box runs Linux
(the one I use the most) and the other runs NT. I run a VNC Server on the
NT box.

I run this program called x2vnc on the linux box which creates a 1 pixel
wide window all along the left side of my screen. When the mouse enters
the window, all mouse and keyboard data are sent to the VNC server on the
NT box, in effect letting me pan across both monitors with a single mouse
and keyboard and not having to switch the Belkin :-)

This works fine on the first page (the left most). If I switch to another
page, x2vnc stops responding unless I move a window on the new page. Then,
I can flip around between the non-first pages without issue. If I switch
back into the first page OR if I manually click a window's decorations OR
if I bring another window into the foreground, x2vnc once again stops
responding. 

Running xwininfo and selecting the furthest leftmost pixel on the screen
returns this. Note that blackbird is the name of the machine running the
vnc server, so I figure the title of the window is set to this.

xwininfo: Window id: 0x7000001 "blackbird"

  Absolute upper-left X:  0
  Absolute upper-left Y:  0
  Relative upper-left X:  0
  Relative upper-left Y:  0
  Width: 1
  Height: 1024
  Depth: 24
  Visual Class: TrueColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOutput
  Colormap: 0x21 (installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: no
  Map State: IsViewable
  Override Redirect State: yes
  Corners:  +0+0  -1279+0  -1279-0  +0-0
  -geometry 1x1024+0+0

Switching pages to a page where vnc isn't responding and running xwininfo
again returns this. Note that the window name is missing and the window
is 1 pixel larger:

xwininfo: Window id: 0x2c00057 (has no name)

  Absolute upper-left X:  0
  Absolute upper-left Y:  0
  Relative upper-left X:  0
  Relative upper-left Y:  0
  Width: 2
  Height: 1024
  Depth: 0
  Visual Class: TrueColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOnly
  Colormap: 0x0 (not installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: no
  Map State: IsViewable
  Override Redirect State: no
  Corners:  +0+0  -1278+0  -1278-0  +0-0
  -geometry 2x1024+0+0

Then moving a window in that page to get vnc once again responding, and
running xwininfo on it returns this:

xwininfo: Window id: 0x7000001 "blackbird"

  Absolute upper-left X:  0
  Absolute upper-left Y:  0
  Relative upper-left X:  0
  Relative upper-left Y:  0
  Width: 1
  Height: 1024
  Depth: 24
  Visual Class: TrueColor
  Border width: 0
  Class: InputOutput
  Colormap: 0x21 (installed)
  Bit Gravity State: ForgetGravity
  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
  Backing Store State: NotUseful
  Save Under State: no
  Map State: IsViewable
  Override Redirect State: yes
  Corners:  +0+0  -1279+0  -1279-0  +0-0
  -geometry 1x1024+0+0

I don't know if this is a problem with fvwm2 or with x2vnc (X11
maybe?) where it appears that the window is getting lost or something. In
any case is there someone else who's seen this or can help me? 

I am running the 20000214 cvs snapshot from the ftp server, XFree86 3.3.5
(shipped with RedHat 6.1), and a combination of Gnome and Fvwm.

Well, this might not necessarily work since the newly mapped window
may well aquire the focus as soon as it pops up.

It looks like the PanFrames are getting the stacking order out of
whack. I don't remember how (or if you can) fiddle with the PanFrames
anymore, but I know some work was done on this a while back. Maybe
there's a runtime option now pertaining to the PanFrames? I assume
you've setup EdgeResistance or the other EdgeMumble option are set not
to change pages at the screen edge. Basically, try to turn the
PanFrames off if you don't use the mouse to pan the display across the
virtual screen.

Thanx much!

I never wanted the Edge scrolling stuff to work in my configuration (I
found it annoying) so I set the EdgeResistance to some ridiculously high
number. Your post got me to looking at the Edge* stuff in the man page and
I noticed the EdgeThickness option. I set EdgeThinkness to 0 and all is
now good!

Thanx :-)

:-)  As I said: no way.  We're deep into feature freeze for
2.4 and such big changes won't be implemented anymore.

In this case:

  AddToFunc FocusAndRaise
  + i flipfocus

  Prev Function FocusAndRaise

or so.

I wouldst be interested. A site just with screen shots and fvwm(2)rc
files would already be nice. I already tried something like this, 
just a free site to which people can upload their stuff. But 
there wasn't much response. See

We aleady have screenshots at fvwm.org.
Anyone can submit them.

I'd prefer not to reference complete fvwmrc's, but stategic parts
would be fine, especially if the text and links are supplied.

Hello,

Just a quick question: what are Pan frames? The keyword appears only
once in the fvwm2 man page under EdgeThickness but does not say what
they are. What's the difference between EdgeThickness 1 and 2?

Thanks,

Neil

  I think the most useful would be to organize the config file(s) into
some canonical structure, so that all themes would have similar
structure. that way you could get just the keybindings or decoration or
some other part of theme...

  I guess that's the role of having the fvwm.themes.org, to have some
kinda of framework. monolithic fvwmrc is fairly flexible, but it makes
it hard to exchange themes if everybody has competely different
structure of the file(s).

In order to enable page scrolling via the mouse, four windows called
the "pan frames" are placed at the very edge of the screen. This is
how fvwm detects the mouse's presence at the window edge. Because of
the way this works, they need to be at the top of the stack and eat
mouse events, so if you have any kind of error along the lines of:
"mouse clicks at the edge of the screen do the wrong thing" you're
having trouble with the pan frames and (assuming you don't use the
mouse to flip between pages) should set the EdgeThickness to 0.

I'm not sure what the difference between 1 and 2 is WRT EdgeThickness,
but I believe that sometimes 1 or 2 can mitigate certain problems.

Hmm. Having just read the manpage entry for EdgeThickness, I don't
really think I've said anything that's not in there... Did this help?

Ofcoursely, to use a good generic theme format would be better than just
a bunch of everyone's fvwmrc files. But unfortunately a good theme format
doesn't exist yet. The guys at fvwm-themes.dhs.org are developing one, 
but I think it's only a pre alpha version. So I guess, casting all themes
in this format would be premature, as the format is likely to change.

So maybe one would have to wait some more until the format reaches a 
final state. Or for now, make a preliminary site, with people's setup 
files..

Yes this really clarifies things. The first two sentences of your explanation
could probably added to the man page as they define the term "pan frames".
The rest about the errors occurring at the edge of the screen would
proably be a suitable addition to the Fvwm FAQ.

Thanks,

Neil

I would like to get all windows that have a title to animate to
fvwmwinlist, and not leave any icons all over my deskspace. I have tried
multiple things, and it's just not happening.

I am running 2.2.4 on a Solaris2.6 box.

Thanks.

You need the latest betas for animation to FvwmWinList.  Won't
work in 2.2.4.

Saw this in the news.

Anyone looking at this from an Fvwm prospective (its open source) ?  I wonder
what window manager they are using or what their plans in this area are.

Apple, AOL veterans making Linux easy --

Veterans of Apple Computer and America Online are setting their sights on
the Macintosh equivalent of Linux--in other words, a version of Linux your
mother could use.

A start-up called Eazel (www.eazel.com) is at work on a graphical user
interface (GUI) for Linux that founders say will extend to every aspect
of the Linux computing experience. The project is an extension of the
Gnome user interface.

With the current Gnome and the competing KDE user interfaces for Linux, it's
still hard to avoid typing in commands, an activity notoriously unpalatable
to average users. Though showing some signs of growth for desktop use, Linux
still is used predominantly on servers. (C/net)

  since they are using gnome I would say they are:

  1) using enlightenment (I'd say they'll go with this)

  2) don't care about the wm (that's kinda hard to believe)

  3) write their own wm (that's logical too, sice wm is prominent part
of user interface, but then again, there's a lot of existing WMs that
work OK and can be configured to be as easy to use as neccessary).

  they say their first effort is shell/file manager, which I guess can
be fairly independent of wm (unless it's written by certain company that
just loves integration:-)

I just changed my fvwm2rc to using one general function, feeding it parameters instead of having multple unique functions.


AddToFunc "Clk-Dclk-HldMv" "C" $0
+		"D" $1
+		"H" $2
+		"M" $2

Mouse 1		I	A	Clk-Dclk-HldMv Iconify Nop Winlistfunc

and i find that there's a noticeable delay if i do it this way instead of
calling a unique function to do the same thing.

Even this is slow to (de)Iconify...

AddToFunc "Clk-Dclk-HldMv" "C" Iconify
+		"D" $1

Mouse 1		I	A	Clk-Dclk-HldMv Nop

i think i've sussed this just by pure chance! it looks as though fvwm is
waiting for the (absence of the) second click before it can decide what it
is to do. i've noticed that certain functions seem to take a while for no
readily apparent reason. then i was playing around with the following:

Mouse 1      WTFSI  SC     Move-or-Lower
Mouse 3      WTFSI  SC     Move-or-Raise

AddToFunc Move-or-Raise
+         "I" Raise
+         "M" Move
+         "D" Lower

AddToFunc Move-or-Lower
+         "C" Lower
+         "M" Move

and i noticed that the mb3 function waits while mb1 is immediate - curious.
looking at the above the only thing i can imagine is that fvwm has to wait
for the double click timeout to expire to be sure whether it's a single or
double click. i hope someone can confirm this?

regards,
siegfried.

Thanx

Yup, that was the reason.  Created a new Clk-HldMv that doesnt contain "D"
and the single click is now full speed.

I s'pose i should change the double click timeout somewheres.
I dont see a fvwm commmand for it, so i s'pose it's a .Xdefaults thing.

Hi,

Recently I moved my UNIX Xterm environment to the
Xterm environment using Window NT Reflection. I used
the same
.fvwm2rc file, but the cursor changed from a simple
"I" to 
half of "X" about font size 18 in bold. I could not
find
anything related to the cursor except the following
commented
out lines in my .fvwm2rc file.

# Cursors
#      cursor #     cursor type
#!WARNING: Keyword "Cursor" not handled yet
#Cursor        6             132

Any help will be much appreciated,
Frank

Once the mouse pointer gets inside an application window
fvwm is going to leave it alone.

I'm not familiar with this "Reflection" thing, but I think
you are seeing an interaction between the xterm which should be
asking for an I-Beam cursor, and the X server.

You should always mention the version of fvwm you are using.
Recents betas of fvwm have had some nice work done on cursor
configuration.

Hope this helps.

I had a working configuration file and wanted to use it on a different
machine.  When I transferred it, some of the stuff didn't work any more.
Specifically the buttons. It says at the top of my file that I need to
make two symbolic links to FvwmButtons 
ln -s FvwmButtons System
ln -s FvwmButtons Net Sites
But I'm not quite sure how to do this or if it would fix my problem.

Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanx
Meghan

Exactly.  BTW, the delay only occurs if you hold the button but
don't start moving.  So, although the cursor doesn't change to the
move cursor, you can still start moving the window.

We need to know the fvwm version numbers on both machines
as well as the complete output on the console.

GNOME is moving away from E (and E is moving away from GNOME) and
Sawmill is gaining grounds instead since it's much leaner and faster...

Another option is probably to change invocations of System and Net Sites
with Module FvwmButtons System and Module FvwmButtons Net\ Sites.
I really don't like the extra symbolic links way of doing things in fvwm
precisely because it makes the config files harder to use by users
who are not familiar with fvwm.

E-mail me your config file and I'll have a look at it and see if
I can change it to a config file which does not make use of extra
symlinks.

Best Regards,

Neil

Hi Dan,

This really helps to provide a clue. Once I setup the
PC mouse cursor, then power cycled the PC, cursor is
back to normal for fvwm. I'm using fvwm version
2.0.46. 

Thanks,
Frank

Hi,

Is there a way to disable the mouse pointer turning to 'O' when clicking
the border? I.e. another way than hacking the sources?

I would like fvwm2 to behave *exactly* like mwm, that's why ;)

Regards,
Xander van Wiggen

ps. at themes.org i get a 404 on fvwm...

Always tell us what version you are using.

We have to know  which button you are clicking  with and  what command
you have bound to it.  For example, heres mouse  button 1 on the frame
with any modifier set to run function Resize-or-Raise:

Mouse 1		F	A	Function "Resize-or-Raise"

and Resize-or-Raise does a "Raise" on a single click:

AddToFunc "Resize-or-Raise" "M" Resize
+              "M" Raise
+              "C" Raise
+              "D" RaiseLower

Some  fvwm commands can  result in the  pointer changing which you can
find in the man page under "Cursor".

I'm using RedHat 6 and fvwm2.2.4.

I've defined my focus policy like this:

GlobalOpts ClickToFocusRaises
Style "*" ClickToFocus

This works fine for a while after fvwm2 starts (a few minutes up to an
hour...). But suddenly it's gone and i've to click the titlebar (or my
FvwmWinList) to regain focus. Restart fvwm2 won't help. Exit to shell
and relaunch fvwm2 does.

Appart from GlobalOpts, i've noticed that Style "*" ClickToFocus only
disables the default MouseFocus behaviour. To get actually focus when
using Style "*" ClickToFocus, you also need an explicit Focus function
in your mouse bindings.

Am i wrong?...

Thnx

Hi everybody!

I'm new to this mailing list, so if I repeat a question you have alredy
answered to, please tell me.
I gave a fast look at the ML archive, but I didn't find anything conerning
my problem.

I always used Fvwm 1.24r in a very simple way, but now I passed to Fvwm
2.2.2, and I'd like to implement this feature :
I'd like to have a FvwmButtons bar similar to the CDE one, so I copied the
example on the man pages, that works fine.
But now I'd like to put both a WindowsList and the TaskBar inside this
Buttons bar.
So I used the Swallow feature, modifying the swallowing of the Pager with
the FvwmWinList, but it didn't work, nothing happened, only a blank button
appears.

Please, help me adding the FvwmWinList to the Buttons bar, it would be a
great feature!

Thank you!

Regards,
Stefano

Is there a way to enable edge flipping only when I'm dragging a window?
I hate accidentally flipping with the mouse, but want to drag windows
between desktops.

Take a look at the manpage entry for EdgeResistance. It allows you to
define resistance for regular mouse movement and window movement
separately.

Virtually all "suddenly clicking somewhere doesn't work anymore"
are caused by some modifier key bein pressed (e.g. num-lock or
scroll-lock).

I've played around with EdgeResistance, but what I want to do is flip
pages only when I'm dragging a window. If I set the first parameter to
something large and the second to something small, it lets me drag them
off the screen but doesn't flip pages.

  it can be done, that's how my setup works:

EdgeScroll 0
0                                                                  
EdgeResistance 400 0

  relevant parts of manpage:

EdgeResistance scrolling moving
...Note that, with "EdgeScroll 0 0", it is still  possible to  move  or 
resize  windows  across  the  edge of the current screen.

EdgeScroll horizontal vertical
...If you don't want any paging or scrolling when you hit the edge of a
page include "EdgeScroll 0 0" in your .fvwm2rc file, or possibly 
better,  set the EdgeThickness to zero.

  I'm using 2.2.4 on solaris and something close to 2.2.4 mon linux, it
works on both (mouse does not change viewport unless you move/resize
windows).

Thanks! That did the trick.

I'm having a little problem with something else now. This is a Windows
alt-tab style window focus flipper. I want it to skip certain things. In
this setup, it skips Gaim and the panel, but it doesn't skip XMMS.

Next [CurrentPage !Iconic !Sticky !Gaim !XFCe*Panel !xmms] RaiseNFocus


In this example it skips xmms and the panel, but not Gaim. Any ideas?

Next [CurrentPage !Iconic !Sticky !xmms !Gaim !XFCe*Panel] RaiseNFocus

  Readers may recall that I'd had problems following the man. page in
getting different pixmaps for my Max button dependant upon the window's
maximised state. Well, the following works OK (it's a little odd [goes
solid white upon the click instead of white wityh pixmap on top] if done
as part of a partial reset, but a full reset/restart makes it work fully):

AddToDecor DefaultDecor  ButtonStyle 2  - MWMDecorMax
AddToDecor DefaultDecor  AddButtonStyle 2  \
         Inactive           (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ToggledInactive    (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm) \
         ActiveUp           (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ActiveDown         (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-on.xpm)  \
         ToggledActiveUp    (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm) \
         ToggledActiveDown  (Pixmap FNX-window-maximise-off.xpm)


  Except (you could see that coming, couldn't you!) it only works when the
button is used to do the maximise:

Mouse 0 2       A       Maximise-Func


  If I use <Ctrl-Open> to do an 80% maximise (similar to click-drag on the
button), the window changes state, but the button stays the same:

PointerKey L7         WTSFI  C       Down-Maximise 0 -10  # <Open>



  Using fvwm2.3.13ish:

AddToFunc do_Down-Maximise  \
   "I" Maximise $0 $1
+  "I" WindowId $w (maximized)  Move w0 -0

AddToFunc Down-Maximise  \
   "I" Pick Function do_Down-Maximise $0 $1

AddToFunc Maximise-Func  \
   "M" Down-Maximise 0 80
+  "C" Down-Maximise 0 100
+  "D" Down-Maximise 100 100



  Any thoughts?

In my opinion it's better to do this sort of thing using the
"CirculateSkip" style.  windows marked with this style won't show up as
the target of a "Next" or "Prev" command, so those commands are more
suitable for focus-flipping.  Here's how I do it in my config:

    Style "Netscape"	CirculateSkip,NoPPosition
    Style "xmmix"	CirculateSkip,NoPPosition
    Style "r?player"	CirculateSkip
    Style "xawtv"	CirculateSkip
    Style "XMcd"	CirculateSkip
    Style "kxicq"	CirculateSkip,Sticky
    Style "mxaudio"	CirculateSkip
    Style "xconsole"    CirculateSkip,WindowListSkip
    Style "vrc"		CirculateSkip,Sticky
    Style "kradio"	CirculateSkip,Sticky
    Style "xplaycd"	CirculateSkip,Sticky
    Style "phone"	CirculateSkip,Sticky,NoHandles
    Style "xpostit"	CirculateSkip,Sticky,NoHandles,NoTitle,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0
    Style "oclock"	CirculateSkip,Sticky,NoHandles,NoTitle,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0
    Style "PostItNote"	CirculateSkip,Sticky,WindowListSkip

These are all the window types I want to avoid focusing on.  Then, my
Alt-Tab binding is a simple function:

    Key Tab	A	M	Function NextWindow
    Key Tab	A	SM	Function PrevWindow

    AddToFunc NextWindow	"I" Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

    AddToFunc PrevWindow	"I" Prev (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

Whatcha think?

I use SloppyFocus for everything. I added the Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus
line, and my functions works properly if i move from my fvwmbuttont to
another window, but if i just move to the root window, the fvwmbuttons
doesnt hide. the focus is lost, but for some reason, the move (to move it
off the stree) is not being called. any ideas?

I need a function to execute if you have lost all focus, when FvwmEvent
with FvwmEventPassID passes $0 as '0'.

Any suggestions?

any way to toggle a style?

Right now I have a key bound to hide the window title, and a diff key bound
to showing it.

Is there a way I can toggle it with one key?

AddToFunc showtitle             "I" Pick Style $n Title
AddToFunc hidetitle             "I" Pick Style $n NoTitle

You probably have a "Style FvwmButtons CirculateSkip" in your fvwm2rc
whihc is causing the "Next (FvwmButtons)" to not do anything. Try this:

AddToFunc showhidebuttons
+ "I" next (FvwmButtons CirculateHit) move 0p +765p
+ "I" current (FvwmButtons) move +0 -0

Cheers,
Tim.

I haven't tried this so it might not work but you could use the fact
that if FvwmEvent passes anything other than 0 it is a window id.  If
the function you want to execute is called root_func this might work:

AddToFunc test_focus
+ I DestroyFunc root_focus
+ I AddToFunc root_focus I root_func
+ I WindowId $0 DestroyFunc root_focus
+ I AddToFunc root_focus I NOP
+ I root_focus

If $0 is a valid id then root_focus becomes (NOP), if it's 0 then
root_focus becomes (root_func, NOP).

Let us know if it works.
Cheers,
Tim.

  I use the follwing with no probs. (using Solaris's ld):

env CPPFLAGS=-I/home/nabird/opt/include CFLAGS=-O2  \
    LDFLAGS="-R/home/nabird/opt/lib -s"  \
configure  \
   --prefix=/home/nabird/opt  \

   --with-xpm-includes=/home/nabird/opt/include  \
   --with-rplay-library=/home/nabird/opt/lib  \
   --with-rplay-includes=/home/nabird/opt/include  \
   --with-readline-library=/home/nabird/opt/lib  \
   --with-readline-includes=/home/nabird/opt/include  \
   --enable-extras


  Try including the equivalent values for CPPFLAGS's -I and LDFLAGS's -R
(or -L); they may cause those dirs. to appear early enough in the command
to work.

ok, this gave me weird results.. when i moved into the buttons, it came=
 up,
when i moved out and into another widnow, it hid itself. when i moved out
and into the root window, it hid itself and then showed itself again!

I got it working using your root window detection code with the following:

*FvwmEvent                      focus_change showhidebuttons
DestroyFunc showhidebuttons
AddToFunc showhidebuttons       "I" WindowID $0 (FvwmButtons) showbuttons
+                               "I" WindowID $0 (!FvwmButtons) hidebuttons
+                               "I" DestroyFunc root_focus
+                               "I" AddToFunc root_focus I hidebuttons
+                               "I" WindowId $0 DestroyFunc root_focus
+                               "I" AddToFunc root_focus I NOP
+                               "I" root_focus

AddToFunc hidebuttons           "I" All (CirculateHit FvwmButtons) Animated=
Move 0p 1197p
AddToFunc showbuttons           "I" All (CirculateHit FvwmButtons) Animated=
Move 0 -0

I didn't receive the original message, but here's how I built it (for
/usr/local installation as root -- I own the box).  I got a prebuilt
libXpm, built readline and rplay myself, then did this.  Hang on to your
hat:

LDOPTS="-R/usr/local/lib" \
./configure \
--with-x \
--x-includes=/usr/openwin/include \
--x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib \
--with-xpm-library=/usr/local/lib/libXpm.so \
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/include \
--with-rplay-library=/usr/local/lib/librplay.so \
--with-rplay-includes=/usr/local/include \
--with-readline-library=/usr/local/lib/libreadline.a \
--with-readline-includes=/usr/local/include \
--enable-extras \
--without-cxx 

LDOPTS="-R/usr/local/lib" make
make install

I'm using Solaris 8EA, with the stock make and ld, and gcc 2.95.2 from
sunfreeware.com.  I had a lot of trouble with one of the extra modules,
which went away with the --without-cxx option.  The LDOPTS bit is so that
I don't have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Anyways, that's what worked for me.  It runs beautifully.  If you need
more assistance, please email me privately and I'll give you more details
about the other libs I used.

I haven't tried this but how about
AddToFunc showtitle             "I" Pick Style $n Title
AddToFunc showtitle             "I" Key a WSFT C hidetitle
AddToFunc hidetitle             "I" Pick Style $n NoTitle
AddToFunc hidetitle             "I" Key a WSFT C showtitle

of course changign key_sym and modifier to whatever you want.

Ok, this works partially. It doesnt work if the key is set to
'hide' when the window you are trying toggling has the titles already
hidden, or set to 'show' and the window has its title shown.

Altho this is a clever trick, it doesnt solve the real problem, which is=
 to
find out if Style is set. Thanks anyways!

Dominik,

I just compiled the new 2.3.14 release, and some of my Style commands
don't seem to be taking effect.  I checked the Changelog and noticed
that you changed the files dealing with styles yesterday.  Could you
shed some light on why the following config isn't working totally
correct?  The one thing that I noticed right away was that my
BorderWidth and HandleWidth commands aren't working.  Also, all of my
Fvwm* windows are coming up with titles and handles.  Any idea?

Thanks a bunch,
Brennan

P.S.  I get the debug statement "adding style '<style_name>'" for each
style command.

It doesn't work because the new style merging logic was (or perhaps
still is) too aggressive.  All styles work fine, but under certain
circumstances the '*' style overrides all others, even if other
style commands are issued later.  I'm working on a fix.

Hi,

I have a function bound to a key (F4) to goto a certain desk and page. 
I'd like to have another function that is bound to another key (F3) that
would take me back to the desk and page where I was before I pressed
F4.  Here's what I came up with, but it didn't work.  Any suggestions?

AddToFunc ReturnToPrevDeskPage
+ "I" GotoDesk 0 ${CUR_DESK}

AddToFunc GotoMyDeskPage
+ "I" SetEnv $d CUR_DESK
+ "I" GotoDesk 0 1
+ "I" GotoPage 0 0

Key F3    A N   ReturnToPrevDeskPage
Key F4    A N   GotoMyDeskPage

I couldn't find a variable which returned the current page!

Thanks,
Brennan

Since beta releases get seen by more people than the daily snapshots, could
you release a 2.3.15 version soon with this fix?

Hi-

I've read the man page til I can't see anymore.  :)  I am trying to set
the colors of the buttons in the Icon Mnager module.  Not when I
mouse-over it, but when it's on its own.  I can't get the buttons to drop
the white background.  My foreground/background settings only seem to work
when I mouse-over it.  Is there a config tag I'm missing?  thanks!

-matt

I'm using vncserver on a Solaris box, and using the -cc 3 (false colormap)
option.  It still seems to be flaky at 16 bit depth, so I'm using the cc
option and 8 bit depth.  Until they fix that, I guess some of my colors
are gonna be screwy.  sorry for the noise!

You don't need a variable to return to the last visited page.
Simply use

  GotoPage prev

This doesn't work with GotoDesk and GotoDeskAndPage yet.  I have
a mostly trivial patch to implement 'prev', but since we're in
feature freeze I won't commit it unless the OK from the
fvwm-workers list.

Is there anyway (other than cd'ing to a different directory before
starting fvwm2) to specify a work or temp directory where to store all of
those temporary dot-files? If not, this would probably be a useful feature
request, something like fvwm2 -tempdir ~/.fvwm2... :-)

Hi,
I am able to launch Netscape with desired geometry in a particular screen 
area initially.

I want to control the placement of "new" Netscape windows that may be 
displayed from within a webpage.
I want all other netscape windows to be displayed (preferably centered) 
within the same screen area as parent netscape window.

Is there any Style option or any other way to achieve this.

yes I had tried these but I think I may have found an actual bug in the
2.3.10 FvwmIconMan module!  Here are the symptoms:  when you fire up the
x server and then the IconMan module, try mousing-over it.  On my display,
when invoked greater than 8 bit, your mouse will start to 'smear' trails
on the X root.  Also, as I said in my last post, the colors in the IconMan
text buttons are screwed up and either totally black, or bleached out.

Once we took a 2.3.6 compile of the IconMan and popped it in the module
directory, our 16-bit X sessions look great, with proper coloring in the
IconMan list and no smearing.

anyone else see this?

This was on Solaris 2.7, fvwm 2.3.10, using the VNC X server, Win VNC
client.

It looks like it doesn't know where the X libraries are.
What happened when you ran "configure"?

Dear all,

recently, I installed fvwm 2.2.4 on a Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha
workstation running OSF1 V4.0e. All works well -- the system looks &
feels like my Linux box...  ;-)  except one little quirk: When I
display a HTML source window with netscape communicator 4.7, the
window appears is not managed by FVWM at all after initial placement.
It receives no decorations, thus I cannot move / raise / lower /
iconify etc. the window using the standard mouse operations. The
window can be iconized with FvwmIconMan, though, and it can be
deleted by invoking FVWM's delete function via a popup menu.

Does anyone else know this effect -- and does anyone know what the
causes are, or what I should try to fix this?

Greetinx & thanx in advance, Jan

I'm not sure what you mean by a "HTML Source window", but if its a
window popped up by Netscape, then you may want to look at
"DecorateTransients" in the man pages.

If its just a case of all Netscape windows lacking decoration,
then I would expect something like:

Style "Netscape*" NoTitle, HandleWidth 0

Hi,
    Under fvwm2, I have four desks, and each desk has four pages.  I use
xemacs in the gnuserve/gnuclient mode.  When I start a new gnuclient
process, I would like the new window to show up
on page 0,0 of the current desk.   Instead, the new gnuclient window
always goes to page 0,0 of desk 0, which is where the original gnuclient
is placed upon initialization.   It seems like the following .fvwm2rc
lines should do the trick:
     Style "*macs*"          StartsOnPage 0 0
     Style "*gnuclient*"     StartsOnPage 0 0
However, if I start a new xemacs, non-gnuclient process, it does the
right thing.
Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Doug

First, remove the file "config.cache" to punt the cached result.

Then, re-run configure exactly as you did before.

Then, send us (a) the configure command line, (b) the version of FVWM,
(c) the type of system you're using, and (d) go through the file
"config.log" and find the place where it starts looking for X and
fails.  Cut that whole section and include it (or, maybe looking at it
will let you solve it yourself, but if not feel free to send it along).

Note that if it can't figure out X maybe you don't have the headers
installed.  Particularly on Linux distros often every package of
libraries is split into a "normal" package and "dev" package, where, the
dev package has all the headers and static libraries.  To build FVWM (or
any other X app) you need the dev package installed.

Hello,

Thanks Paul for your reaction.
A question: is it neccesary to have Xpm-library installed?

Andre,

I have a RH5.2 system and fvwm2 has always compiled just fine for me.  It
is not necessary to have xpm support when you compile fvwm2, but it allows
shaped xpm's and I think is a nice feature.  On my system X11/Intrinsic.h
is located at

/usr/X11/include/X11/Intrinsic.h

and is part of the package

[tom]$ rpm -qf /usr/X11/include/X11/Intrinsic.h
XFree86-devel-3.3.3.1-1.1

I highly doubt that this is a recent version of X; I haven't bothered to
keep everything up to date since I plan to switch over to RH6.1 shortly.

I would suggest that first you use rpm to check the integrity of the
package and make sure nothing has been moved or deleted with --verify.

Hope this helps,
Tom

That you can iconify the window proves that the window is indeed
managed.  Dan is probably right - for some reason the window is
not decorated.

I guess he means the window you get with 'View page source'
entry from the right mouse button menu over a html window.

You can check if the window is transient with the FvwmIdent module.
(simply start it, select the window and look for the line
'Transient:     Yes/No').

This may hint to a bug in the module, but it is *definitely* a bug
in your X server.

I have committed a fix for a FvwmIconMan colour problem a few
minutes ago.  This might solve your problem.

The gnuclient window has the window group hint set to point
to the original frame.  Fvwm always keeps windows in the same
group on the same desk.  At present there is no option
controlling this.  You can disable the responsible code
explicitly by removing the following code:

  placement.c, lines 542 to 555 (in current CVS code):

    if((tmp_win->wmhints)&&(tmp_win->wmhints->flags & WindowGroupHint)&&
       (tmp_win->wmhints->window_group != None)&&
       (tmp_win->wmhints->window_group != Scr.Root))
    {
      /* Try to find the group leader or another window
       * in the group */
      for (t = Scr.FvwmRoot.next; t != NULL; t = t->next)
      {
	if((t->w == tmp_win->wmhints->window_group)||
	   ((t->wmhints)&&(t->wmhints->flags & WindowGroupHint)&&
	    (t->wmhints->window_group==tmp_win->wmhints->window_group)))
	  tmp_win->Desk = t->Desk;
      }
    }

Is there a way for me to stick a number in the title for each subsequent
window that is created that has the same title as one that already exists in
my window manager? (much like how kde does it - for those who have used
kde.)

Thanks!

Could you please write an enhancement request and place
it in Jitterbug?

Hi everybody!

With fvwm 2.2.2, I'm trying to change the font for the menus with the MenuStyle
option, in this way :

MenuStyle * Font fontname

but whichever font I give it, fvwm2 uses always the default built-in.
I also used a fontname that works with other fvwm2 options, but menu's font is
always the built-in one.

Thank you!
Stefano

True -- I must admit that I didn't choose the wording in the subject
100% accurately. Also, the initial placement interaction indicates
management, of course.

Yep.

No, it's not the transient window handling, described in the FAQ. The
"Find" dialog box receives standard decorations.

No, it wasn't this -- I found the line that causes the trouble:

    Style "*"  MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride

After commenting this out, the "View Source" window of netscape
receives normal decorations. With a little more experimentation, I
found out that the "MWMDecor" style option is responsible for the
problem. As I don't know about MWM and its particular decoration
behaviour, I still don't fully understand why the HTML source window
of all netscape windows elicits this effect. Perhaps, there's
something unclean in the netscape code that causes uninitialized
garbage to be passed as window manager flag arrays...?

I must admit that I "inherited" the trouble making line from the system
default fvwm2 startup file that came with my Linux distribution, and I
just put this ~/.fvwm2rc file (which I modified quite extensively, yet
without looking at all the "inherited" stuff in detail) from the Linux
box mentioned above to the Alpha workstation.

Thanks to all who replied.

Greetinx, Jan

Just luck.  This was a very old bug that could even crash fvwm
if you use

  Style * Icon, NoIconTitle

but the application provides no icon and you don't have a default
icon.

I'll commit a fix soon.

I have a Matrox G400 board that allows my two 1280x1024 monitors to
appear to the X server as a single 2560x1024 monitor. I would like
crreated windows to popup on the monitor (=> which half of desktop) I
initiate them from. They currently have a preference for the upper left
corner.

Is there a method to use sloppy focus and still  bound the window to
appear within some distance from the current cursor location? Or is
there a way to make the desktop smaller that the screen size and still
use two desktops at the same time? The man page says you can have
"multiple disjoint   desktops   which  can  be  used  separately  or
together." I haven't been able to figure out how to implement this.

I have been using my current setup for about 5 years, so I may be a bit
rusty. Sorry if the answer is obvious.

Can you send me the exact MenuStyle line that doesn't work, please?

The adjuration to be "normal" seems shockingly repellent to me; I see neither
hope nor comfort in sinking to that low level.  I think it is ignorance that
makes people think of abnormality only with horror and allows them to remain
undismayed at the proximity of "normal" to average and mediocre.  For surely
anyone who achieves anything is, essentially, abnormal.

Hello,

I can't GrabFocusTransient to work with the Netscape Find popup dialog
box. I have the following:

Style Navigator RaiseTransient, DontStackTransientParent, NoIconTitle
Style findDialog_popup GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent

... and the following doesn't work either:

Style Netscape RaiseTransient, DontStackTransientParent, NoIconTitle
Style "Netscape: Find" GrabFocus, DontStackTransientParent

What did I do wrong?

Thanks,

Neil

  I think it does not work if the transient is invoked from menu (try
alt-f)

  is it still a problem in latest betas?

This is the syntax :

MenuStyle * Font fontname

I tried these fontnames :

-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*
-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
-adobe-helvetica-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
helvetica-12
adobehelvetica-12

and a lot of others combinations, but unsuccessful.
The first three above fontnames work perfectly with fvwm2 in other
configuration sections.

Thank you!
