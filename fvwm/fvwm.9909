I'm not sure what you're explaining here. Are you saying that you have
windows running off of hosts FOO, BAR, and BAZ, and for each host, you have
a separate icon manager?

I wouldn't exactly consider fvwm2 "mainstream". I'm even considering
switching back to a *twm variant just for kicks. :)

I think what Brian wants is to disable managers that don't 
have windows to display.

Hi,

On my fvwm2 setup (2.2.2), I'm using an FvwmButtons bar at the
bottom of the screen and would like to get my maximizefunctions
not to place windows over the bar.
It works if I do "Maximize 100 842p" on this particular machine,
but I would like to do something that works on all machines
I work on.
For example, "Maximize 100 -80p" could maximize windows depending
on the current screen height, minus 80 pixels from the bottom.
Sadly however, that doesn't work at all.
Is there a way to do a work-around for this, or something?

Another way I can think of would be if fvwm2 could read environment
variables, so I could make a script that executes before fvwm, that
sets the variables WIDTH and HEIGHT, which I could then use in
my .fvwm2rc file like "Maximize 100 $HEIGHT-80" or something similar.

Are any of these things something you've thought of implementing?

Thanks,

Staffan Hämälä

Have you tried something like

Maximize 100 90

Which will maximize to 90% of the height of the screen. Admittedly it
won't give perfect results all the time but it should work nicely in
most cases.

You can do this if you use the FvwmM4 module to preprocess your config. 
The line should read

Maximize 100 eval(HEIGHT - 80)p

that's right (no visible iconmanager for host BOD when I'm not running

Yup, I've just coded the '-80p' syntax in the development sources.

well, one way I can think of implementing this is having the xterm
spawning function start a iconman for that host, and another (perhaps
run with FvwmCommand from the .logout) close that iconman when the
last xterm of that host closes.

I havn't tried doing this, but I think it might work...

Thanks, but I think that's more or less what I was trying to avoid.

The critical thing seems to me to be need for a nummanagers setting.
The only way I could see of fixing things is to have the spawning
function make a new .fvwm2rc with an incremented nummanagers, & restart
fvwm2.  This would be pretty ugly, undressing & dressing all the
windows, & not all that fast on the old machines I have.  I was hoping
there might be an alternative to specifying a literal value for
nummanagers in .fvwm2rc.

Have I missed something?

I don't think you'll need to restart fvwm - you can use the Read
command to read the new iconman (say FvwmIconManBOD) configuration,
then just spawn the new module.  and when you're done, Close
FvwmIconManBOD should make it go away.  Or perhaps I'm missing
something?

Thanks, I hadn't realised you could do this.
But (I'm probably wearing out my welcome here ...) I like launching 
programs from outside the window manager.  Is it possible to send messages
to fvwm2 from outside?

Thanks again,
Brian Keck

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS: In case the external launching seems pointless, here's an example
where it's particularly convenient.  When I'm at home, I log in to work
from my laptop, & start 8 xterms on the laptop, & do 8 rlogins to the
same host at work.  This is manually tedious, especially when the line
is not all that reliable.  So I have a script called 'xterms', & just say
	xterms -h chook a-da-d
where chook is the host at work, & a,b,c,d are positions on the screen.
(The script sets the xterm names so they go to the chook iconmanager, &
sets the xterm geometries.)

yup, look at the FvwmCommand modules and man page :)

Why are you trying to avoid it? If it works, you can use it. If it doesn't,
you can go back to *twm.

If I find the time I will take a look at FvwmIconMan and see if
an option can easily be added. The code is well structured so
it might mot be too much troube, but that is only a guess.

Hm, do you have a small sample configuration with more than one
manager?

Actually, this used to be the way it worked.  I have three Icon
managers defined in my .fvwm2rc and have had it this way for a long
time over several different versions of fvwm2.  With the newer
versions, the icon manager will display a blank placeholder if there
are no windows that correspond to that manager.  Older versions simply
didn't appear in that case.

For example, 

  *FvwmIconMan*nummanagers	3

  *FvwmIconMan*1*title		"Cadence DFII Windows"
  *FvwmIconMan*1*buttongeometry	150x0
  *FvwmIconMan*1*managergeometry	1x0-0+500
  *FvwmIconMan*1*show		resource=Cadence* \
                                resource=icfb  resource=dockit resource=LSW \
                                resource=opus resource=cdsLibManager

If I'm running cadence, then I get several items in icon manager 1 as
expected.  Now, however, when I'm not running Cadence, I get a single
entry in the icon manager with the title "Cadence DFII Windows" in it.

It seems to me that this is something that was a "fix" in the newer
revisions.  However, I prefered it the old way.

Sorry, I can't remember the specific version numbers -- 1.4 maybe?

Your correct it did use to work this way.  I questioned Brady Montz (the
FvwmIconMan mainter at the time) about it and he said that it was a very
unreliable hack to map and unmap the managers, so he removed it.  I
still have the old code and if time permits I'll try to diff it out and
see if I can make sense of it now.  But my feeling is if Brady said it
was a bad hack then it probablly was.  My advice to you as his was to me
is get used to it, it won't take long.  And now two years later I just
ignore the empty managers floating around.

Yes!
Thanks for your patience - I only had 2.2 & hadn't seen FvwmCommand.
Looks perfect, & I always wanted to be able to talk to my wm for other reasons.

Thanks to others too - my 2nd post did a lot better than my 1st.

  hey guys,

  while working in X (using fvwm 2.2.something) I use some keyboard
shortcuts that use ctrl and/or alt keys. after certain time from start of
fvwm these stop working, it looks like the ctrl and alt keys are ignored.
__restart_of_fvwm_does_not_help__. it only happens in linux (it happened in
old version of fvwm too, for at least few years), I use fvwm on solaris and
it works fine (I use the same keyboard shotcuts there).

  ctrl and alt work fine in other applications.

  any ideas what's going on? thanks in advance.

Is Num Lock turned on when it stops working?

  I am not sure, but I can sure check it. do you think that the numlock
disables the control/alt in some way? like having the alt with num lock off
and alt with numlock on are two different key combinations? (just like ctrl
and ctrl-alt are two different key combinations?)

  under solaris, exceed (win X server) and fvwm 2.2.x both numlock on and
numlock off work the same way (alt and ctrl shortcuts work).

  :-))

  what is the big numlock problem in unix? I noticed that the realplayer
(older versions) did not work (more precisely: the menu did not work) with
numlock on, we were told by Continuus people (source code control system, we
have solaris version) that our problems with help not working might be
because of the numlock etc...

  thanks for a suggestion. I'll try it when I get home...

According to the X specification, NumLock is a modifier Mod3 to be
precise. and fvwm honors anything that has a keycode of Mod n.  So if
you define Ctrl+Meta right arrow to do something you could also define
Ctrl+Meta+NumLock right arrow to do something else. e.x.
Key Right A CM  Scroll +100 0
Key Right A CM3 Scroll +200 0

  thanks a lot for clarification. that means that the exceed server is
broken, right? (since the numlock does not have any effect on shortcuts)

  I also noticed that under linux the arrow keys and the numeric pad arrow
keys are not the same, but exceed considers them to be the same keys (at
least apps do not make distinction).

Perhaps this section from our FAQ helps you:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in you configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine ore very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. E.g. do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.

No, it just means that the default modifier of Num_Lock is different
than it is for your Unix server.  If you run "xmodmap -pm" you will see
what modifiers are defined to be what.  Different X servers can have
different defaults.

Here's my HPUX server:

    $ xmodmap -pm
    xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

    shift       Shift_R (0xd),  Shift_L (0x18)
    lock        Caps_Lock (0x1c)
    control     Control_R (0xe),  Control_L (0x19)
    mod1        Alt_R (0xf),  Alt_L (0x12)
    mod2      
    mod3      
    mod4      
    mod5      

And here's my Linux server:

    $ xmodmap -pm
    xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

    shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
    lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
    control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
    mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
    mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
    mod3      
    mod4      
    mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

As you can see, the Linux (XFree) server defaults to adding a few
modifiers that HPUX does not.  So under XFree, hitting Num-Lock or
Scroll-Lock by mistake, causes lots of keys to stop working.  Under
HPUX, hitting Num-Lock has little effect.

If I really wanted to fix this behavior, I suppose a command like
"xmodmap -e 'Clear mod2' -e 'Clear mod5'" would do the trick.

  thanks a lot (Brad, Dominik, Fuzzy), I can't wait to get home to try the
new xmodmap magic I've just learned!

  while still at work (solaris, fvwm 2.2.x, exceed on win nt):

  xmodmap -pm says:

panther:~>xmodmap -pm
xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0xc),  Shift_R (0x48)
lock        Caps_Lock (0xb)
control     Control_L (0x11),  Control_R (0x49)
mod1        Alt_L (0x10),  Alt_R (0x4a)
mod2
mod3        Num_Lock (0x52)
mod4
mod5

  there is following shortcut in the fvwm config file:

# erik: Alt-Fn to go to a specific page (like on the Linux console)
Key F1          A       M       GotoPage 0 0

  the shortcut works no matter what's the status of numlock. if I understand
previous explanations correctly, it should not work. I have the same
shortcut at home and it does not work sometime (probably because of numlock,
I haven't verified it yet, though).

  also:

  fvwm2 man page lists following modifiers:

  S, C, M, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (and A for any)

  while xmodmap lists:

  shift, lock, control, mod1-5

  there is no lock in fvwm2 list and no M in xmodmap list. does anybody have
any further insight into this?

  [M seems to be the alt key, but alt key is mod1, according to xmodmap.
does it mean that M and 1 are the same?]

  thanks again.

Hello,

I am having trouble figuring out where buttons go in the FvwmButtons box.

I basically want a column of buttons, each with different heights.  
I thought using Containers would do the trick, but not so.
For example, I would like to have three buttons.  Button one is 64 units
high, button two is 32 units high and button three is 10 units high.

*FvwmButtonsColumns        1

*FvwmButtons(Container(Rows 1, Columns 1, Frame 1))
*FvwmButtons(Size 0 64, Swallow asclock 'Exec asclock &')
*FvwmButtons(End)

*FvwmButtons(Container(Rows 1, Columns 1, Frame 1))
*FvwmButtons(Size 0 32, Title xlock, Action 'Exec xlock')
*FvwmButtons(End)

*FvwmButtons(Container(Rows 1, Columns 1, Frame 1))
*FvwmButtons(Size 0 10, Title xlock2, Action 'Exec xlock')
*FvwmButtons(End)

This gives me three buttons, but each with height 64.
Any suggestions on how to get each button to the height specified?

Thanks,
Sam

Hello.
I am using fvwm2 and I do have the usual mouse binding to resize windows
Now, I need to have a window Style that let me have some windows with border

It should be somethilng like that:

Style "name" NoTitle, NoHandle, BorderWidth 5

but it doesn't put any border...

                        ^^^^^^^^

It's 'NoHandles'. Note the 's' at the end.  However, disabling the
handles only switches off the cursors over the border. You can still
resize the window.

Yup. It's much simpler than what you tried to do:

*FvwmButtonsColumns 1
*FvwmButtons(1x64, Swallow asclock 'Exec asclock &')
*FvwmButtons(1x32, Title xlock, Action 'Exec xlock')
*FvwmButtons(1x32, Title xlock2, Action 'Exec xlock')

Typing mistake.

Is there any way to tell fvwm that some windows cannot be resized?
I'm sure that there have to be a way to acomplish this...

Only by writing the application in a way that it asks for a
specific size from the window manager. THere is no Style
option allowing this.

I know it's pretty insane to start an interactive shell in fvwm2
directly, but it would be nice if you could kill it nicely afterwards.

Executing next line in fvwm2 causes a freeze:

Exec read foo

I switched to the console, tried to kill the sh process with INT, HUP,
KILL with no success. After KILL ps tells that the process is defunct,
but I still can't continue working. Only killing fvwm2 with KILL
"works", but I'd prefer not to do that.

Is it hard to make fvwm2 a little more foolproof? ;-p

Regards,

Tung

  Basically, I've set up my fvwm such that all windows come up with
title-bars, unless I explicitly apply a NoTitle style.

  Um. /How/ have I done this? I've got:


GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart
Emulate       fvwm

Style "*"  BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4
Style "*"  Icon unknown1.xpm
Style "*"  MWMDecor, MWMFunctions, OLDecor, HintOverride
Style "*"  DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"  SloppyFocus, SkipMapping
Style "*"  RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
Style "*"  UseDecor DefaultDecor, MWMButtons
Style "*"  IconBox 0 381 -1 -1, IconFill Top Right
Style "*"  BackColor #40bdff, ForeColor Black


  I think that's the relevant stuff. I'd've expected OLDecor to make fvwm
recognise the _OL_DECOR_xxx hints, but obviously something's overriding
this. Is it HintOverride (seems to be a menu-only thing) or maybe
DecorateTransient (my window's not transient)?

  The window I want to lose the title-bar for is a dummy OL-hint test
proggy, BTW.

Does the window have any buttons on the titlebar? Titlebars are switched
on if there are buttons to display.  You might want to turn off the
MWMDecor for this client.

  The program in question is *just* a test one: it only has an
XCreateSimpleWindow(), plus the necessary gubbins to set _OL_DECOR_DEL to
contain _OL_DECOR_HEADER before mapping.

  ol[v]wm then opens the blank window with no title. Should fvwm honour
this? It looks, from fvwm/decorations.c, like it should, but to be honest,
I got a bit lost amonst all the !~&| flags!

When fvwm gets it wrong does it display a menu button in the title bar?

Line 342 of decorations.c has this:

  /* This rule is implicit, but its easier to deal with if
   * I take care of it now */
  if(decor & (MWM_DECOR_MENU| MWM_DECOR_MINIMIZE | MWM_DECOR_MAXIMIZE))
    decor |= MWM_DECOR_TITLE;

could you put a couple of printf's around this to see if MWM_DECOR_TITLE
is being set here?

Cheers,
Tim.

I tried this on Solaris 2.6, with fvwm 2.3.7 both from my .fvwm2rc
and from FvwmTalk without any problem or message.

Perhaps you can give more details.

In general we recommend:

Exec exec <command>

not that I know if this will change your symptom.

I've been trying to customize the look and position of the FvwmPager and
have come upon some issues and questions.

I've been trying to find a successful way to remove the section of the
window containing the Desk label. I only have one Desk, so I dont need to
give it a label. *FvwmPagerLabel * "" makes it blank, but the space is
still there at the top.

Other issues i've encountered -- *FvwmPagerIconGeometry is apparently
ignored if you also have Style "FvwmPager" NoIconTitle and
*FvwmPagerStartIconic (true). Any combination of two seems to work as
expected, but all together, the pager is placed at +0+0 (iconified with no
icon title), disregarding the IconGeometry item.

If these all worked, I could get the results I'm looking for - the iconic
state of FvwmPager acts as a one-desk pager, with no desk label. But there
is still an icon title at the bottom.

On the side, I've also noticed that when you set the FvwmPagerGeometry (or
IconGeometry) to just a width OR a height, the result page proportion is
visually correct only for square numbers of screens (1, 4, 9, etc). My
desktop has 3x2 pages, but FvwmPager doesn't size itself to the proportion
(2x1, roughly) that would cause each page to be in the right proportion.

If anyone can give me pointers to solutions, hacks I could make to the
source, etc, I would appreciate it.

TIA,

  I think we might be going the wrong way here! I *don't* think fvwm's
getting wrong (at this stage). All I think is that somehow I've got fvwm
ignoring OLDecor, and I'm trying to figure out which option's done it.

  But yes, if I get the time, I'll do a debug fvwm & find out what bit's
forced the appearance of the title-bar.

can't help you with the icon (I use iconman, so I don't have icons on
my screen at all) but here's your lable solution:  (man FvwmPager)

	*FvwmPagerFont font-name
              Specified a font to use to label the desktops.   If
              font_name  is "none" then no desktop labels will be
              displayed.

Is there a way to disable the label on FvwmPager?

I'm not talking about the title, but the header for each DESK.

*FvwmPagerLabel 0 ""

This sets the label for DESK zero to the empty string, but you still
have a space where the label would go.  I want that space to be used
by the virtual DESKTOP viewer (i.e. the pager.)

Thanks again,
Sam

I found where the "--prefix-builtins" (not --prefix-buttons) is coming from. 
FvwmM4.c:

259    if(m4_prefix)
260      sprintf(options, "%s --prefix-builtins %s > %s\n",
261              m4_prog,
262              m4_options, tmp_name);
263    else
264      sprintf(options, "%s  %s > %s\n",
265              m4_prog,
266              m4_options, tmp_name);
267    tmpf = popen(options, "w");
268    if (tmpf == NULL) {
269      perror("Cannot open pipe to m4");
270      exit(0377);
271    }

So when I use the "-m4-prefix" option the "--prefix-builtins" is added but m4
sees this as a bad option.  The current version of m4 on my system does not
support this option.  I will fix this.

I was finally able to get the .fvwm2desk to read in without being processed by
either M4 or CPP.  Here is what I did:

###################### Initialization Functions ##########################
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmBanner
+                        "I" Module FvwmButtons
+                        "I" Module FvwmBacker
+                        "I" Module FvwmTaskBar
+                        "I" Module FvwmAuto 500
+                        "I" Module FvwmCommandS
+                        "I" Module FvwmAnimate
+                        "I" read /home/misha21/.fvwm2desk

Now the only problem I have is my "re-labeled" windows.  Is there a way to have
the "Wait" label be passed back from the application and not what the current
window label is.  Here is a snippet of what I mean.

Here is what I currently get from FvwmSaveDesk:

AddToFunc InitFunction  "I" Desk 0 1
+               "I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x45+67+1 -name ssbun -title ssbun -bg
 antiquewhite -fg black -bd magenta4 -e rlogin -8 ssbun &
+               "I" Wait ssbun pts/50 /home/misha21

In this case, how hard would it be to have the "Wait" label use the same name as
the xterms "-title" option?

For now I will have to hand edit this file, but it sure would be nice to have it
be hands off.

Thank you for all the hard work and time spent on improving Fvwm.

Bob

Help me with this. I don't know how these kind of things exactly works.
I need to tell fvwm not to resize some windows. I am able to do it now by this
Stryle (literaly):

Style "Netscape*" NoHandles, NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, ClickToFocus

The problem with this is that I have no Border and I would like to have. I
don't want to have Title.

You are telling me that I can tell a specific size for my application to the
window manager (is it part of ICCCM?). I don't have access to the aplication
(Netscape), so, do you know if is there any way to simulate this request from
outside netscape? Can I send this request from another program?

Thanks a lot, Pablo

If its Netscape  you  don't want  resized, the  above suggestion isn't
going to help unless  you are using   the source from Mozilla.org  and
make your own  modifications.   The  modifications would  consist   of
setting the window hints with a maximum and  minimum window size which
fvwm will honor.

If you don't want Netscape resized, then the simplest course of action
would be to not resize it.  But I suspect that you are after something
else.

Fvwm will let you remove the window  frames and the  title bar, but if
you have the command  "Resize" bound to a button   or a key, you  will
still be able to  resize the window.  If you  don't want ANY window to
be resized, don't have  any menu, key or  button  bound to the  resize
command, and don't  allow any of the  fvwm modules to be started  that
would let an fvwm command to be entered.

I'm not aware of any way you can change a windows size hints without
changing the program that creates the window.

Well, fvwm *could* do it. Any application can set hints on a
window as long as the window id is know. It wouldn't be hard
to write a command that sets a window's size hints in fvwm,
but I'm not enthusiatic about this idea.

This approach is very unreliable, but it has has tempting
possibilities. This is what I'm doing with the colour sets
of FvwmButtons swallowed applications, and I was thinking
about a 'SetGeometry' command that has some functionality
of 'Move' and 'Resize'. It could handle size hints too.

  you can tell what the mouse click/drag/double click do on the border -
just search for Resized, Move in the config file (usually ~/.fvwm2rc). I do
not know if this can be set per window basis.

No, it's a global setting.

But look at this:

...
Style "Netscape*" NoHandles, NoTitle, BorderWidth 0, ClickToCous
"Resize binding ON"
...

With this configuration I am not able to resize Netscape windows. But I am able
to resize any others.
If I put BorderWidth 5, for example, now I am able to resize the Netscape
window, but I dont want this, I want Netscape to continus 'unresizable' while
having a BorderWidth nonzero.


ps: I know, its strange. thats why i was asking first, because there is an
ambiguity.

I am having the darnest time finding the right parameters to pass to
IconBox.

I resized an xterm to the size I wanted and moved it where I wanted
the "box" for my icons.  Then I used xwininfo and FvwmIdent to get the
geometry of the xterm.  I used those values as args to IconBox, but
the icons were not placed in the right location when they were
iconified.

Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on finding the right geometry
and size to pass as parameters to the option IconBox?

Thanks,
Sam

I just tried it, and I was able to resize the window.

You can't resize by using the frame, because its not there, but
I clicked on the root, brought up a "window operations" menu,
selected resize, the pointer turned into a cross, I clicked on
the window, got the resize frames, and dragged them around to resize.

If you are looking for button bindings to be different, just for Netscape
borders,  sorry, fvwm doesn't do that.

Use xv instead of xterm.  The geometries from xterm are in characters,
not pixels.

  I have applied NoTitle to 'perfmeter', since that's the way I want it.
However, even with DecorateTransient set for it, it's config. window comes
up with no title bar (so I can't close it with the mouse only).

  Is this a case of NoTitle being applied to all of permeter's windows, or
another OLDecor cock up?

The style name matches not only the name of the window, but the
resource and class of the application too. You have to find a
pattern that matches only the window name. Perhaps you can
set the title explicitly or rename the executable.

I just installed Solaris 7 and when I try to build fvwm2.2.2,
I get the following:

configure: error: can not run test program while cross compiling

I'm using a Sparc2.

I put a link from /usr/ucb/cc to point to gcc.

Any ideas on what is happening here.

Thanks

Thanks for all your help in setting up FVWM; I'm very close to getting
my environment "right".  Now I'd like to do something a little bit
fancy.

First, I was wondering if there was a way to use FvwmButton to start
an application AND iconify it.  For example, if you have an FvwmButton
that starts Netscape, then:

* if you press it and no Netscape running, a netscape starts
* if you press it and Netscape is running, netscape iconifies
* if you press it and Netscape is running and is iconified, it deiconfies

Basically once the application is started, the button becomes an
"iconify" toggle.  Is this possible?

Similarly, I was wondering if you can have an FvwmButton "swallow" the
icon of a window when it is iconified?  Using the example above, if you 
iconify a netscape then the icon would disappear into the FvwmButton that
started the application, instead of there being a Netscape icon on
your desktop.

Ideally, I would like an FvwmButton to be setup to:

  a) start only one instance of an application
  b) be bound to (de)iconify that application instance
  c) swallow the icon of that application when iconified

Thanks,
Sam

Configure should find gcc automatically.  You should not need to make
that symlink.

Can you compile a simple "hello world" program with gcc?  Is it
installed correctly?

Think so. You should be able to define a function like the following:

AddToFunc Netscape I None Netscape Exec exec netscape -iconic
+                  I Next Netscape Iconify

See the manpage entry for AddToFunc and for Current to get an idea of
how this works.

The swallowing of an icon by FvwmButtons isn't possible, I'm pretty
sure. Sorry.

  OK, I'll try it in a sec.

  On a related note, if I do:

Style Some*   SomeSetting1
Style SomeApp SomeSetting2

  ... then I ought to get SomeSetting1 & 2 for SomeApp.

  If I then do:

Style SomeApp SomeSetting3

  ... does that *replace* the previous Style for that name, or extend it?
I'd expect it to replace it, but I'm not certain, since 'Style * sssss'
works across multiple statements - except that that's probably a special
case.

  In fact, is there a way of blatting a Style def. at all? E.g. "Style
NoMore"

Probably your compiler is set up to generate code for a
different architecture.  You need a compiler that can
generate code for you machine.

Alright you are just making this to hard try something like 

netscape -xrm "*Navigator.maxHeight: 200" -xrm "*Navigator.maxWidth: 400" -xrm "*Navigator.minHeight: 200" -xrm "*Navigator.minWidth: 400"

You could also put thos values in your .Xdefaults file.

  Nope. I had to restart to clear the Style! As it happens, in this case
(perfmeter), I no longer needed NoTitle for it since fvwm's no obeying the
app.'s OLDecor :-)

  I'll have a look at the code to see if there's aught about removing
styles.

Hi folks.
I'm new to the list so please be kind ;-/
If someone could please point me to the docs that pertain to creation
setup and altering of menues I will be glad to do the reading. I am in
the process of setting up 125 work stations
in an office and I talked the customer into Red Hat 6.0 but I need to
add programs to menues
and icon links to spacific programs.
Sory about the newbie questions but everybody starts somewhere, rite

spacifics:
All the machines are { I686 pentium pro's 2oo mhz (ya I know) 128 meg
ram s3 trio video
and generic ne2000 pci on ETH0 ..They are already running rh 6 and fvwm
with no trouble and I have installed some .rpm pkgs that put the menu
items where they belong.  So how do I add the links to the menu when the
setup doesn't?

Thank You for your time
Dug

  that's really easy. just check the config file. it is usually called
.fvwm2rc and it's in home directory of each user running fvwm2.

  search the file for the name of the program that is already in the menu,
or for the string that you see as menu item. it is fairly trivial to add the
program then.

Basically you put the command 'AddToMenu' in the config file, e.g.

  Addtomenu WMMenu "Window managers" Title
  + afterstep Restart afterstep
  + blackbox  Restart blackbox
  + gnome     Beep
  + icewm     Restart icewm
  + kde       Restart kde
  + kwm       Restart kwm
  + olwm      Restart olwm
  + twm       Restart twm

The '+' is just an abbreviation for the last AddToMenu command.
You will find the documentation in the fvwm2 man page. Look for
the AddToMenu command. You may want to read the sections for
'Menu', 'Popup' and 'MenuStyle' too.

Configuring the RedHat setup is a different story. I'm not
familiar with it myself, but there is a section in our FAQ:

  3.1  I use FVWM on a RedHat Linux system and can't figure out how to
       change my FVWM configuration.  I've read the FVWM man page but when
       I edit my .fvwm2rc nothing seems to happen.  What's going on?

  A: RedHat Linux installs the X server accompanied (by default) by a
     configuration management system.  In earlier releases it was called
     TheNextLevel and in more recent releases it's called AnotherLevel.
     For further information about TheNextLevel, consult RedHat's
     documentation in /usr/doc/TheNextLevel/.  For information about
     AnotherLevel, do a 'man AnotherLevel'.

> and icon links to spacific programs.

This is nothing the window manager is doing but usually a task of
the desktop environment (like GNOME, CDE or KDE).  The only hint
I can give you is to try KFM (the file manager of KDE), but this
has a few severe limitations in how it plays with other window
managers than KWM (the window manager of KDE).  A completely
different way of handling this problem is using the FvwmButtons
module of fvwm.  Basically it is a box of buttons that trigger
actions like starting applications, moving windows or switching
pages upon a button press.  It's even possible to make it look
transparent so you could fake the individual icon look.  Please
have a look at the man page.  I have attached of a screenshot
of the FvwmButtons I use.  You will find one of my older
configs in the man page of FvwmButtons (the second full example).

'course :-) Hope you didn't have any bad experiences with mailing

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.  What kind of 'links' are
you talking about?

If you want Some* applications to see SomeSetting1, but not SomeApp,
then you could do this

    Style Some*   SomeSetting1
    Style SomeApp SomeSetting2,NoSomeSetting1

Hi Dug,

I have not yet upgraded to RH6.0, but if you are using the AnotherLevel
stuff with Fvwm I think I can give you a few pointers.  In what follows I
am going to assume that the directory structure is the same as my RH5.2
system.  If it's not, let me know and I know someone who probably knows
the answer to these questions.

Right.  If you look at the directory 

/etc/X11/wmconfig/

you will find a bunch of files like xv or acroread which contain
something like this:

$cat /etc/X11/wmconfig/xv
xv name "xv"
xv description "XV Image Viewer and Conversion Util"
xv exec "xv &"
xv group "Graphics"


$ cat /etc/X11/wmconfig/acroread 
acroread name "Acrobat Reader"
acroread description "Adobe Acrobat Reader"
acroread group Applications
acroread exec "acroread &"
acroread mini-icon "mini-pdf.xpm"

Creating a file with this sort of syntax in this directory will
add the menu item (with or without) icon for every user.

I'm not sure what you mean by links...  If this helps, great.  If not let
say so and I'll try to help.

Everything is installed in the default directories. If I don't put a symlink
to gcc, then the configure script exits saying '/usr/ucb/cc: language
optional software package not installed'.
I'm kind of new to this, but I expect when I installed solaris7 at least the
C complier would work. I did a full install. If I create the link, then it
gets me past this and using an answer from the archive, I'm able to
configure and make. I still don't understand why the C compiler does not
work.

Last I checked, C compiler wasn't builtin to Solaris. You needed to
separately license (to the tune of $1K, IIRC) the C compiler. In any
event, you'll probably be much happier going out and grabbing the full
suite of GNU development tools: gcc, g++, gdb, auto{conf,make}, m4,
etc.

Unless you have a 64-bit kernel. I think gcc still doesn't build
64-bit Solaris binaries... Sorry, I've been out of the loop a while.

Attached is a unified diff against fvwm-2.2.2. Basically, it enhances
the symantics of StickIcons to also mean "FixedIcons" (or
"IconsThatRememberTheirPlace" or whatever is deemed the best way to
describe this :-) (StickyIconsAreReallySticky??)

With this patch, StickyIcons are AutoPlaced when first iconised, from
then on stay where they were placed, exactly as if they were manually
placed. Non-StickyIcons will shuffle aside when changing pages to avoid
landing on top of a StickyIcon.

Works a treat :-)

Ben

It may work, but...

The patch should be against the current CVS sources (2.3.8).

The patch should preserve existing functionality.  (I think existing
users of sticky icons, would still want them to autoarrange.)

The patch must include a man page update.

There should be a ChangeLog entry.

Try this:

  AddToFunc StartOrIconifyNetscape
  + I Next (!Netscape*) Exec exec netscape
  + I Next (Netscape) Iconify toggle

This function relies on the fact that netscape takes a while before
the window is created. Otherwise the new window would be immediately
iconified by the second line.  The 'toggle' syntax is new in the
2.3.x betas.  I think the old way to do this was to simply say 'Iconify'.

Ok, I'll go via the CVS tree, and add appropriate documentation.

I wanted to add a separate Style label for this 'FixedIcons', but the
Style flags bitmask is full. I see others have come across the same
problem (i.e. tmpflags, new_flags), but really can't see how I can add a
new flag without major changes to the whole shebang.

As I also think that, symantically, having 'fixed' StickyIcons makes
sense, I chose to add use that flag.

Suggestions as to how to incorporate this new/modifed style are
welcome...

Regards,

Check out the latest CVS sources, we are no longer out of style flags.

I think icons  that follow  you desk  to  desk and  page  to page  are
different than icons that hold their initial position.  (StayInPlace).

Well, there  is  a  relationship,  if  an   icon is both    sticky and
stayinplace, and you change desks, your going to have  icons end up on
top of each other.

AddToFunc StartOrIconifyNetscape
+ I Next [! Netscape*] Exec exec netscape
+ I Next [Netscape] Iconify

*FvwmButtons(1x10, Title nettoggle, Action StartOrIconifyNetscape)

Thanks; it almost works.  The iconify part works fine, but a new
netscape is always started even if one is already opened.  It's as if
the !Netscape is always ignored.  I'll try a few more things.

Thanks,
Sam

My fault. I should be

  AddToFunc StartOrIconifyNetscape
  + I None (Netscape*) Exec exec netscape
  + I Next (Netscape) Iconify toggle

I just saw tkdesk for the first time and was pretty impressed.  One
thing I was wondering:  is there a way to "hide" FvwmButtons like
you can in tkdesk.  If you haven't seen it, there is a small button at
the top of the tkdesk "button bar" that you press and the whole
thing (except the small button) disappears.  Press the button
again and it comes back.

Maybe the real question is, do a lot of people run tkdesk with
fvwm, or is there a way to use fvwm modules to do the same thing?

Thanks,

Matt

Hi,
Maybe I did what you are talking about, using module FvwmButtons:
in my theme (you can see it on my homepage: www.sehnsucht.org) I
made 2 drop-down menus on the right side of the screen.

This is the code used to build the one which disappears when you
click on the button with the violet sphere in the upper right corner
of the root window:

Style "NetFvwmButtons"  NoTitle,NoHandles , ClickToFocus , Sticky, WindowListSkip, HandleWidth 0, 
BorderWidth 0
*NetFvwmButtonsPixmap none
*NetFvwmButtonsGeometry -8+4
*NetFvwmButtons( - ,Icon net.xpm, Panel (down)  Net)

*NetFvwmButtonsPanel Net
Style "NetFvwmButtonsPanel"  NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip , HandleWidth 0
*NetFvwmButtonsBack #888888
*NetFvwmButtonsColumns 1
*NetFvwmButtonsPadding 0 0
*NetFvwmButtonsGeometry +3-5
*NetFvwmButtons( - ,Icon b-netscape.xpm , Action (Mouse 1) " exec communicator-smotif-461  &")
*NetFvwmButtons( -  ,Icon b-mutt.xpm ,  Action (Mouse 1) " exec xterm -bg black -fg white -T mUtT 
-geometry  130x70+403+160 -fn -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal-*-*-140-*-*-m-*-iso8859-1 -e mutt &")
*NetFvwmButtons( - ,Icon b-kvirc.xpm , Action (Mouse 1) " exec kvirc &")
*NetFvwmButtons( - ,Icon b-wxftp.xpm , Action (Mouse 1) " exec wxftp &")
*NetFvwmButtons(- , Icon b-fetchmail.xpm , Action (Mouse 1) " exec xterm -bg '#202020' -fg white  
-T FeTcHmAiL  -geometry -250-200 -e fetchmail &")
*NetFvwmButtons(- , Icon b-caterpillar.xpm , Action (Mouse 1) " exec   xterm -bg '#202020' -fg 
blue  -T dSeLeCt  -geometry -250-200 -e su -c dselect &")
*NetFvwmButtons(- , Icon b-kill.xpm , Action (Mouse 1)  " exec killall -9 chat &")

as you can see, there is also another drop-down menu near this.

bye.

"AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV"
Thank you for your time and interest. This is the letter you've been 
reading about in the news lately.  Due to the popularity of this letter 
on the Internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire 
show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it 
really can make people money.
The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their 
findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program. This has helped to show 
people that this is a simple, harmless and fun way to make some extra 
money at home.
The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many people are 
participating that those involved are doing much better than ever 
before.  Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, it's been 
very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will understand once you 
experience it.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is 
being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research 
and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all 
goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid 
to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 
500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in 
the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics show 45 people 
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.
You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump 
made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he 
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. 
Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a good network marketing 
company and get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He 
looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response:
"That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!"
The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my 
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some 
thought and study to it. My name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the 
corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my 
position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to 
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen 
financial problems.  I owed my family, friends and creditors over 
$35,000.
The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to 
make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support 
my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant 
happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes 
that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!
In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior 
to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on 
various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my 
opinion, were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me 
to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to 
see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million 
dollars in one year...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make 
it!
But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I 
didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing 
list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make 
sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a 
MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, 
without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and 
figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you 
I was still a little sceptical and a little worried about the legal 
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office 
(1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! 
After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I 
decided "WHY NOT."
Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time 
on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for 
printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are 
fulfilled via e-mail, my only expense is my time. I am telling you like 
it is I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would 
not "rip-off" anyone, no matter how much money it made me.
In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1 By 
January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to 
"RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, 
SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!" My first step in making $50,000 in 
90 days was done.  By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT 
#2. Your goal is to "RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 
WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE 100 
ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL." Well, 
I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and 
relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with 
more coming in every day.
I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take 
time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!  ! 
Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work , 
but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to 
place your name in a different place. It won't work and you'll lose out 
on a lot of money!
In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20+ orders 
for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 
or more in 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!
If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really 
is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to 
participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial 
security. If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial 
trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider 
this a sign. I DID!
Sincerely,
Johnathon Rourke



A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should 
have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not 
have been created by an amateur.
Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 
10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the 
same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't 
working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me, it was the economy.  
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been 
with us since 1945.I don't have to tell you what happened to the 
unemployment rate... because many of you know from first hand 
experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.
The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing 
invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who 
never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of 
the poor. As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET 
POORER." The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to 
"move up" or "get rich", inflation will see to that.
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom 
for the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF 
EFFORT." You can make more money in the next few months than you have 
ever imagined. I should also point out that I will not see a penny of 
this money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this 
program. I have already made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS!I have retired from 
the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs.
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way . 
It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of 
this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you 
send this to may send out 50,000...and your name will be on everyone of 
them!
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you 
will reach.
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
"THINK ABOUT IT"
Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take 
a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and 
figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst 
possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still 
make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any 
doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS!
Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA
HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$
INSTRUCTIONS:
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME.  I am sure 
that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you 
say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully.
This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making 
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multi-level 
businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling 
our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new 
multi-level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar 
sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not 
involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, 
store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing 
anywhere.
This is what you MUST do:
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if 
you don't order them).
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU 
ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in 
case of a problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to 
the report.  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE 
OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four 
reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them on 
your computer and resell them.
* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four 
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you 
to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to 
each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is 
instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the 
majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll 
also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has 
been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.
a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and 
remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has made it 
through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!  c. Move the 
name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.  d. Move the name 
and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.  e. Move the name and 
address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.  f.  Insert your name/address 
in the REPORT #1 position.
Please make sure you COPY ALL INFORMATION, every name and address, 
ACCURATELY!
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and 
save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of 
this letter.
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can 
afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet connection and 
e-mail is FREE!


There are two primary methods of building your downline:
METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs 
each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using 
a good list the response could be much better. Also, many people will 
send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But 
continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 
0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people 
respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of 
those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 
2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000.
The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to 
that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. 
CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + 
$50,000 for a total of $55,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 
1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND 
TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF 
EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000.  Believe 
me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to 
participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already have 
an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT #2 will show you the 
best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you where to obtain free bulk 
e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists.


METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the internet is very, very inexpensive, and there are 
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start 
small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 
people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on 
the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that 
everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.
Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:
1st level-your 10 members with 
$5.......................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)...........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000).....$50,000
THIS TOTALS ---------->$55,550
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only 
recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 
20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants!  THINK 
ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them 
the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON 
ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR 
name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until 
they receive the report!

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******
* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the 
directions accurately.
* Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the 
orders start coming in because: When you receive a $5 order, you MUST 
send out the requested product/report.
* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!
* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow these guidelines to 
guarantee your success:
If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, Continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks 
later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don 
't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have 
received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the 
system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll 
in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching 
which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more 
income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start 
the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will 
generate from this business!
Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in 
this program. Please answer one question. DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR 
LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look at the following facts about 
this program:

1. You are selling a product which does not Cost anything to PRODUCE, 
SHIP OR ADVERTISE.
2. All of your customers pay you in CASH!
3. E-mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing 
information on earth. This program combines the distribution power of 
e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level 
marketing.
4. Your only expense-other than your initial $20 investment-is your 
time!
5. Virtually all of the income you generate from this program is PURE 
PROFIT!
6. This program will change your LIFE FOREVER.

ACT NOW! Take your first step toward achieving financial independence.  
Order the reports and follow the program outlined above-SUCCESS will be 
your reward.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

How aboout this (with FvwmButtons):

 1) Draw a pixmap you want to use for this button. Lets call
    it iconify_buttons.xpm.

 2) Tell fvwm to use the pixmap as FvwmButtons's icon:

      style FvwmButtons Icon iconify_buttons.xpm

 3) Tell fvwm where to place the icon (modify the coordinates
    to suit your setup):

      style FvwmButtons IconBox +0 +0 +31 +31

 4) Set up FvwmButtons:

      *FvwmButtons(1x1+0+0, Icon iconify_buttons.xpm, \
                   Action Next (FvwmButtons) Iconify)

This won't work very well if you move your button bar and
requires some work to find the right place for the icon, but
it should work.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

    well, it caused a problem in FvwmConfig.h compilation,
    IMHO it's not a nice idea to define standered keywords.

2.3.7 is a particularly unfortunate version to start using panels.
I have rewritten the panel code from scratch between 2.3.8, so it
would be best if you don't try to get it running with 2.3.7.  Fetch
a copy of 2.3.8 as soon as it appears on our ftp server (may be
already there).  I wrote some instructions on how to set up
panels with the new code in the new FvwmButtons man page
('CREATING SUBPANELS' section). Don't hesitate to ask is that
leaves open questions.

Hi,

  I'm running fvwm2.3.8.  If I 'WindowShade' a Netscape window, then open
up another instance of Netscape (using the -remote 'openBrowser()' flag),
it too is opened up in shaded mode, or so it seems.  Because of my
options, which are below:

---------

GlobalOpts RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage, ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage, \
           CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage, NoStipledTitles, \
           SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

Style "Netscape*" Icon netscape.xpm, RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement

---------

...the new Netscape window gets placed at the bottom of the screen, so
that all I see is the titlebar.  From both my and FvwmPager's points of
view, this new window looks to be WindowShaded.  But it isn't because if I
move to the screen below, there is the new Netscape window in plain view.  
(The new window doesn't show up in FvwmPager until I move it, for some odd
reason.)

  But wait, there's more.  The new window is not the correct geometry.  In
fact, FvwmIdent reveals that it is of size 1018x32744.  No, that is not a
typo.  :-)  (It should be 1018x683, which is the un-WindowShaded size of
the original Netscape window.)

  Now, I'm not convinced that this is an fvwm2 bug because I get the
expected results when I 'WindowShade' a Netscape window, then use Alt-N
(while over its titlebar) to open a new browser window.  Both the Alt-N
and "-remote 'openBrower()'" methods work as expected when the original
Netscape window is not WindowShaded.  The only time this happens is when
the original Netscape window is WindowShaded, *and* the "-remote
'openBrower()'" method is used to open a new browser window.  Maybe the
new window is looking for the original window's geometry, but it's
something weird and unexpected (in my case, 1018x-3) so it doesn't know
quite what to do?  If so, can fvwm2 'fake' the geometry, telling the new
window instance what the un-WindowShaded geometry of the original window 
would be, instead of the 'bogus' 1018x-3 geometry?  Or does the X server
handle these type of inquiries?  Hmm...  I hope I'm making sense.  Let me
know if any info or clarifications are needed.

Thanks for your time,
-jason


p.s.  Two feature requests, while I'm at it:

1. The option to choose the line style in FvwmPager (I always change it to
LineSolid in the source -- it's nicer looking to me).

2. The option to specify which FvwmAnimate animations to use.  I like
Flip, Turn & Twist, but not the others, so I always edit the source so
that specifying Random in .fvwm2rc will produce only one of the three I
like.  Something like

*FvwmAnimateEffect Twist, Turn, Flip

might be nice.

Eeek, another application that can't handle windowshaded windows.
XEmacs has the same quirk sometimes. The reason is that netscape
queries its own geometry - which is kind of screwed up when the
window is shaded. It takes the old window's height - which is
around zero, subtracts the height of the frame drawn by fvwm
which is usually about 20 to 30 pixels and uses the result
(-20 to -30) pixels to create a new window. The negative number
is interpreted as a very large positive number in the request
and fvwm limits the height to its max value.

Unfortunately I can't see what we can do about it. Of course
fvwm could prevent the window from becoming 32767 pixels high,
but if the window requests a screwed up geometry, fvwm is unable
to guess the correct height.

In the file events.c you will find these lines:

    if (cre->value_mask & CWHeight &&
	/* patch to ignore height changes to astronomically large windows
	 * (needed for XEmacs 20.4) */

Can you please add the following line before it:

  if(cre->value_mask&CWHeight)fprintf(stderr,"cr: height=0x%x\n",(int)cre->height);

And send me the output this generates when you open the screwed up
window?

Bye

No, sorry.  Although the button drawing code is quite complex, it

That is because FvwmConfig isn't maintained anymore. The define of
inline is necessary to be able to use inline at all because it is not
standard in C compilers.

Hi folks,

I've come across a problem with Netscape.  I'm using fvwm2.2, Solaris 7 on
a Sun Ultra 1 and in my configuration file I had

Style "Netscape"   	StartsOnPage 3 0, SkipMapping

This worked fine with Netscape v3.x, but we have recently got Communicator
4.61.  Here, the SkipMapping seems to kill the StartsOnPage and it always
starts on the current page.  If I take SkipMapping out, then the
StartsOnPage works, but I can't stop the cursor from warping to every
instance of Netscape.  So anyway, I'm not sure how much of this has to do
with fvwm, because it worked with the old version of Netscape that we had,
but does anyone have any ideas?

ferg

ps. this problem also occurs with mxaudio, and perhaps others....

	My guess is that since Jamie Zawinski left, Netscape doesn't have
anyone around to keep the X group honest.  :-)

	I've been looking into a similar problem reported with The Gimp. In
that case I've just determined that the problem is that for no good
reason they made a couple of the windows (the startup window and the Tip
of the Day) transients. StartsOnPage isn't honored for transients if
SkipMapping is in effect. It's assumed that transients are used in a
sensible, normal way, and that you must have the window for which it's a
transient already in your viewport, and that you'd expect to see the
transient pop up in the visible viewport also.

	Now, fixing this will take a while, since it will require a new Style
option. The existing GlobalOpts technique for StartsOnPage options
really won't do, since in most cases you really wouldn't want
StartsOnPage/SkipMapping honored for transients - only for certain weird
apps. And since we're in that area, we need to convert the existing
GlobalOpts options to Style options.

	This particular quirk is not necessarily the problem with NetScrape
4.61 - in fact it doesn't sound too likely - but it's  got to be
something similar. Unfortunately, I don't have 4.61. In fact, I got so
annoyed with some of the changes they made with 4.5-something that I've
stayed with 4.08 on my personal development machine, and have resisted
upgrading. So, I suppose I'll have to grab the new one and see if I can
figure out what bogosity they've introduced.

	Can you tell us anything more specific? Does it happen with all
Netscape windows, or just certain ones?


Cheers,
Bob

As far as I can tell, it is happening with _every_ Netscape window.

I'm not sure if this is related, but here's something I noticed with
my netscape.  SOMETIMES, when I click on the bookmarks button, the
window that appears shows up at the edge of the screen.  It will
happen with one window of netscape, while the rest are working just
fine.  If I move that netscape window just a pixle, the problem goes
away.

Netscape 4.61, fvwm2.3.3 (I know, need to upgrade)


Style "Netscape"        Color Gray/NETWORK_COLOUR, StartsonPage 1 1, \
			SkipMapping, MiniIcon mini-nscape.xpm
Style "Netscape*"       UseStyle Netscape
Style "*Mosaic*"        UseStyle Netscape, DecorateTransient

I have noticed the same with function menus in XEmacs. It's 
definitely a fvwm bug.  We had something similar a while ago.
I will investigate it as soon as I find the time.

Hi there,
    I just started to use fvwm and was wondering if there was a way to make
the mouse left-handed.
Please reply to me directly since I am not a member of this group.

Thanks, in advance.

This is not a windowmanager problem.  Use xmodmap to switch the order
of the buttons.  The first example in the xmodmap man page covers this
issue:

EXAMPLES
       Many pointers are designed such that the first  button  is
       pressed  using the index finger of the right hand.  People
       who are left-handed frequently find that it is  more  com=AD
       fortable to reverse the button codes that get generated so
       that the primary button is pressed using the index  finger
       of  the  left  hand.   This  could  be  done on a 3 button
       pointer as follows:

            %  xmodmap -e "pointer =3D 3 2 1"

	That's actually more of a session manager[1] issue than a
window manager issue.  The command to use is

	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

If you have more than three real buttons[2], continue the sequence at
the beginning.  If you have virtual buttons (for example, you have a
roller that you've mapped up to button 4 and down to button 5), add
them at the end of the list.  For example, the command for my cordless 
wheel mouse is

	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5"

Where you put this depends upon what, if any, session manager you use.
It's quite possible that your session startup script already invokes
xmodmap.  For example, the standard XConsortium xinitrc looks for
${HOME}/.xmodmap, and uses it for the xmodmap commands (what is in
quotes above).

[1] This isn't a rigorous definition, but a session manager handles
what applications are started when you log in/start X, and a window
manager handles how the windows displayed by applications are
displayed.  Session managers are a newer innovation than window
managers, so you may just be dropping things in ${HOME}/.xinitrc .

[2] That are usable left-handed - I don't think "thumb" buttons are
terribly useful, but then, I have short fingers.

The easiest way is to put this command somewhere in you X
startup file:

  xmodmap -e "pointer 3 2 1"

Or add it to the InitFunction in your .fvwm2rc:

  AddToFunc InitFuction
  + "I" Exec exec xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

	I finally downloaded Netscape 4.6, and I can't make it fail either. My
Style line is like this:

Style "Netscape*"    SkipMapping, StartsOnPage 1 1 1

and it works perfectly.

	I don't know what could be different about your system. As I said, I'm
working on StartsOnPage workarounds for a couple of quirky apps (The
Gimp and xv), but I can't really debug this one if I can't reproduce it.

	Does anyone else have any ideas?


Cheers,

I'm doing a Linux Users Group presentation on the fvwm2 window manager.  
It will be brief, but I would like to cover some of the history of fvwm. 
(ie how it got started, who was involved, why it was done, etc...)

Can anyone help me in obtaining this info.  I've seen little pertaining 
to this on the website.

Any other suggestions?

I was tinkering with my .fvwm2rc file, and I found that if you put a
comment in it, and end the comment line with a '\', the file might be
parsed incorrectly.  I am using fvwm 2.3.8.

For example, suppose you have the following:

# This is a comment \
MenuStyle "*" ... (whatever your options are)


The '\' prior to the MenuStyle command fouls it up, causing the menu style
to be set with default values for color, font, etc.  Strangely enough, the
following 3 examples do *not* cause problems.  It seems that the only
commands that are affected are those for which the previous line is a
comment that ends with '\'.  Note that adding any characters after the '\'
or putting empty lines or more comments between the rogue comment and the
desired command makes the problem go away, as shown below.

These examples are ok:

######################################################################

# (Illustrates that only the immediate line after the '\' is affected)
# This is a comment \

MenuStyle "*" ... (whatever your options are)

######################################################################

# (Illustrates again that only the immediate line after the '\' is affected)
# This is a comment \
# and this is another
MenuStyle "*" ... (whatever your options are)

######################################################################

# (Illustrates that the last character must be '\')
# This is a comment \p
MenuStyle "*" ... (whatever your options are)

  Jason,

  the \ character is often used to `unspecial` the special characters, in
this case meaning that the new line right after it would NOT be considered
an end of line - i.e. the next line is basically the same line for the
purposes of the program that reads the file.

  it's probably clear enough, but here's an example anyway:

first line \
second line

  would be read as one line:

first line second line

  your MenuStyle command is thus commented out.

  Yes, I knew that's what its purpose was.  I just didn't expect it to
apply on a comment line, so I thought it was a bug.  This is how /bin/sh
works, e.g.:

#!/bin/sh
# \
echo hello
echo world

produces the ouput:

hello
world

when executed, since everything on a comment line is ignored.  I wasn't
aware that fvwm implements this differently, especially since the way
/bin/sh implements it seems more natural to me.  Oh, well.  I'm glad to
hear that it's not a bug.  ;-)

  well, I would say that the sh behaviour is a bug:-))

  sometime it is hard to distinguish the bug from the feature... (maybe it
is indeed a bug in fvwmrc parsing, it depends on what behaviour they wanted)

I often use:

#!/bin/sh
# \
exec tclsh $0 $*

... rest of script

or replace tclsh with perl or whatever.. The sh executes the exec line,
tclsh and everything else skips it. Allows me to use tclsh from my PATH
instead of a hardcoded location. sh is always in /bin, everything else
changes location.

All:

I recently saw a question and several answers on this mailing 
list that inspired me to finally play with functions and FvwmButtons 
a little more.  I don't see how to implement what I want to do, 
though, and any advice would be appreciated.  

I am using fvwm 2.2.2 with FvwmCPP on Solaris and/or Linux, and 
although I don't use Netscape to read my E-mail many people 
using my fvwm2rc file do.  I want to provide a Netscape button 
in FvwmButtons that does three jobs:

	Mouse button 1: focus or start netscape

	Mouse button 2: iconize or de-iconize netscape

	Mouse button 3: 
		if( there is a "MailThread" window ) then
			focus it
		else
			if( there is a Netscape window ) then
				# have it open a MailThread
				netscape -remote 'openInbox'
			else
				# start a new NS process in mail
				netscape -mail
			endif;
		endif;

Buttons 1 and 2 were easy, thanks to the information on the 
mailing list last week.  

This is for button 1:
	AddToFunc "StartOrFocusNetscape"
	+ I None (Netscape*) exec netscape -install
	+ I Next (Netscape) Iconify -1
	+ I Next (Netscape) Focus

Button 2 just does:
	'Prev (Netscape) Iconify toggle'

Button 3 is too complicated and I don't see that there is any syntax 
that will handle it.  If you could combine conditions then it 
could look similar to the following:
  AddToFunc NSMailFunction
  + "I" Next (MailThread) Iconify -1
  + "I" Next (MailThread) focus
  + "I" None (MailThread) Next(Netscape) Exec exec netscape -remote 'openInbox'
  + "I" None (MailThread) None(Netscape) Exec exec netscape -mail

of course, that is not valid syntax.  Is there some other way 
to do this?  I didn't see it in the manpages or FAQ.  Thanks 
in advance for any help.

Actually it is valid syntax (you might need a space between the next and
the "(" though) and it does work. Here's my functions for controlling
netscape. Note that netscape is not very good at handling mutiple remote
commands and sometimes loses them.


DestroyFunc my_netscape
AddToFunc my_netscape   I Next (Netscape) Exec netscape -noraise -remote
openBrowser
+                       I None (Netscape) Exec target netscape

Just an off-topic note: as far as I know this _only_ works with Tcl.  It
definitely doesn't work with Perl, which treats backslash-newlines in
comments just like the shell does1 (that is, ignores the backslash and
doesn't concatenate the newline).

I don't know of any other interpreter except tclsh that does it this
way.  Personally, I feel the perl/sh way is more intuitive: a comment is
a comment, and _everything_ in a comment should be completely
ignored... including trailing backslashes.

The most intuitive way I can think of is that comment lines are completely
removed except that a trailing backslash prevents the line end.
Thus you could say

fooabr=1\
	2\
#	3\
	4

or in a makefile:

OBJECTS = \
#	foo.o \
	bar.o \
	foobar.o

and the lines beginning with '#' would be silently removed from
the input.

Of course that *is* valid syntax. It doesn't work because you forgot
a whitespace between the 'Next' and the '(Netscape)':

AddToFunc NSMailFunction
+ "I" Next (MailThread) Iconify -1
+ "I" Next (MailThread) focus
+ "I" None (MailThread) Next (Netscape) Exec exec netscape -remote 'openInbox'
+ "I" None (MailThread) None (Netscape) Exec exec netscape -mail
                           ^^^

I've tried it and it works (current development code).

The Next/None/Prev/... commands simply interpret everything after the
condition as a new command.  It doesn't matter at all if this is another
contidional command or something else.  However the first token of the
following text is a command name and must hence be separated from its
parameters with whitespace.

This piece of information is out of date.  There IS a non-beta fvwm2:

  fvwm  was frozen   at   v1.24r, and  all  development  was   moved  to
  fvwm2. Though officially still  beta, is in  fact very stable and much
  preferred to v1.24r.

The fvwm mail archives contain the history of fvwm2, unfortunately,
they don't go back to the very beginning.

They do chonicle the change from Cathedral to Bazaar development
which I see as the most interesting change.

Dear All,

I've been running fvwm, fvwm2 for years and I am pretty happy with that.
However, after I installled GNOME-1.0 (FreeBSD-3.2) and launched gmc
(GNOME Midnight Commander) it said me ...

** WARNING **: Root window clicks will not work as no GNOME-compliant
window manager could be found!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there way to make them understand each other ? 
Sorry, maybe it has been discussed already, but I'm subscribed to the

I've seen a page for something called fvwm2gnome that should fix
your problem. I haven't tried it though, and I don't have the
link handy, but you could try a search for that on altavista.

The next official release of FVWM, 2.4, will contain native support for
GNOME (i.e., be a "GNOME-compliant window manager").

We are well on our way into development on this; a number of beta tests
have been released.  If you're interested in playing with beta code, you
can find it on the ftp.gnu.org site.  Note this is _really_ beta code,
not "kinda beta but really released" code like the 2.0.x stuff.

There are also daily source snapshots available.  And, of course, for
those who just gotta be current, you can use anon-CVS to get
up-to-the-second code.

There's a lot of new, cool stuff here, but it's still beta.  If you use
it please read the info on reporting bugs carefully.  You may also
consider tracking the fvwm-workers mailing list more closely.

Thanks Dan, I'm a dumbass ... I'd updated the URL but not this text.

Hi all,
I'm a user of fvwm on a pentium machine. I switched from an IBM AIX
xwindows system to a Linux system, and find some things difficult in fvwm.
For example, when I need to press ALT-TAB keys, to focus and raise another
window, but it just focusses.

Can you please help me how to configure it so that by presing ALT-TAB key
I can raise and focus on another window ? I tried all the configurations
in the .fvwmrc file (at the keyboard section) but I didn't get it work.
And it seems feasible, because by clicking the mouse, you can focus and
raise the window.

Thank you for your time,
Adrian

I had a lot of trouble with this, too, because it "just worked" in
fvwm1.  One solution is to use FvwmAuto to raise the focused window. 
The other is this one that I like better:

    Key Tab	A	M	Function NextWindow
    Key Tab	A	SM	Function PrevWindow

    AddToFunc NextWindow	"I" Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

    AddToFunc PrevWindow	"I" Prev (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

That works if you use MouseFocus, but not ClickToFocus.
