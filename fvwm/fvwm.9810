Is there any way to get the current mouse selection in an fvwm2 function
as use it as a "variable"?

i.e., I'd like to highlight something (like a machine name, for example)
and then select a menu item or press a function key that would execute an
fvwm2 function that would log me in to that machine. e.g.:

AddToFunc RshHost               "I" Exec xterm -T $0 -n $0 -e rsh $selection &

where "$selection" is just something I made up that would contain the
contents of the current X selection.

Any ideas?

This isn't exactly what you want but this might work
 
AddToFunc RshHost  "I" Exec xterm -T $0 -n $0 -e rsh \ 
`xprop -root CUT_BUFFER0 | sed 's/^.*=..\(.*\).$/\1/'` &

I didn't test this but I know the xprop thing works in a shell script so
once you get the quoting right it should work

i use to use fvwm-2.0.38 on my HP workstation (9.0.5).  my InitFunction

fvwm started a console window automatically.

my HP has been upgraded to 10.20 and i downloaded fvwm-2.0.46.  i no
longer get the console window.  has this feature been taken out?  or
is my assumption incorrect?

i have opened an xterm -C but i do not receive console output in this
window for some odd reason.

can someone suggest anything to help?  either with fvwm or the HP
workstation OS.

thanks,

Thanks,

But what if I wanted to control pointer movement through the keyboard?

In particular I would like to use my keypad to move the pointer.

This is possible, and I don't know whether the window manager has anything 

to do with this at all, but I recall that Red Hat Linux 4.2 made it possible 

to do this under Fvwm2. The way the Red Hat guys had it configured was that 

when you pressed "Num Lock" or "Ins" on the keypad or sth like that the pointer

could be moved vi the keypad with the buttons 1,2,3,4,6,7,8, and 9. 5 did

something like click or toggle mouse functionality and keypad functionality.

I can't remember the details but I know it's possible because I've seen it work.

I have asked about this before but nobody was able to give an answer.

Perhaps this time, someone will give me a hint as to where to look.

TIA,

Neil

redhat 4.2 having that configuration (as an option)

My setup does this.  It uses Sh-Ctrl-arrows, and Sh-Alt-arrows to move
the pointer at two different speeds.

However, I don't know how to do it by toggling numlock, and I don't know
how to generate "click" events from the keyboard.

If you find out how, tell me.  :)

Right Shift + NumLock allows the keypad to control the cursor.
1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9  move the cursor (hold down * while moving to speed it
up), and 5 is the mouse click (it toggles btwn left, right, or center by
hitting /,*, or - b/f hand)
	hope this helps,

It's me again with yet another innovative suggestion:

There should be a property that could be defined in the .fvwm2rc config file
with the line:

FocusWindowStaysVisible

or something like that. What it would do is the following: say I am typing in
an xterm and launch netscape. On small screens especially, typically netscape
ends up covering the xterm window. As you are typing, you end up typing into the
window with the netscape browser (netscape takes about 15 minuts to come up on
my PC so I usually try to do something else while it launches). The same applies
to other applications, not just Netscape. So when I launch them, I don't care 
where they end up, as long as they don't cover the window that has focus (or
the window that had last focus if i am launching from a menu).

I think it's a very desirable feature, and IMHO it's just as useful in speeding
things up as "SloppyFocus". I am sick and tired of having to move windows out
of the way just cause they popup in the wrong spot (I use "Smart"Placement).
On the other hand I would hate to have to use the mous to position a window all
the time.

Please send me some feedback on this,

TIA,

Neil

This sounds like a nice feature, PROVIDED you could turn it off. The
inclusion of FvwmAuto in version 2 of Fvwm meant that people like me
who like autoraise, but on the very odd occasion want to turn it off
can by simply killing the module. Perhaps a module to handle your idea
would be good? And perhaps could include some intelligent window
organizing features.

regards to all,

Chris

The answer depends a little bit on how X is installed on your system.
For most people you need a startup file, and the last thing in the
startup file should be the command to run fvwm.  A typically startup
file might look like this:

   #! /bin/sh
   /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
   /usr/X11R6/bin/xbiff
   exec /usr/local/bin/fvwm2
   
Of course you will need to adjust the paths to point to where your
X11 and fvwm are stored.

This startup file typically needs to be called EITHER: .xsession or
.xinitrc (both would go in your home directory).

If you have something other than a basic UNIX setup you may need a more
complicated system to get your window manager to start (for example
some Windows system with X servers have very complex setup procedures).
You might check the documentation which came with your X window system.

If the above does not work for you, send me your error messages and
I will see what I can do (no promises though).

You'll need to put all clients except the last one in the background.

Or better, just let your environment and $PATH handle it. So a trivial
startup script would be:

  xterm &
  xbiff &
  fvwm2

When X starts this script is executed. When the script finishes X quits,
so all client should be in the background, except the last one, which
is typically the window manager. So doing a quit from the wm quits X.

You can start X by running xinit, which looks for .xinitrc. However,
it is generally better to run a script which sets up the X environment
correctly before calling xinit. On many linux distributions this script
is called startx, and looks for a file called .Xclients.

If you wish I can send a copy of a simplified startx script I wrote
for my own use.

If xdm is running, it will usually look for .xsession, so you
should use that instead if running xdm.

If none of this works for you let me know what platform(s) you are
using and I'll try to give more specific advice.

Phil,

    I tried to make .xsession using pico. I cant see the file though. 


My file actually uses these paths.

#! /bin/sh
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
/usr/X11R6/bin/xbiff
/exec /usr/lib/X11/fvwm95-2

How do I run that startup file?

I tried /.xsession but got permission denied. 

For the flavor of unix I am running? It is redhat 4.2 with kernel source of
2.0.35

Any tips?

Thanks,

Joe Fialkowski

Hello,

   Well I am running redhat 4.2 with the source of 2.0.35 and I am actually
trying to run fvwm95-2.
If you could send me a script I would greatly appreciate it.

The paths of my files are

#! /bin/sh
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
/usr/X11R6/bin/xbiff
exec /usr/lib/X11/fvwm95-2

Thanks for your help in this matter....

OK, I have RedHat 4.2 here, as well. You already have startx, in
/usr/X11R6/bin.

1. Make sure /usr/X11R6/bin is in your PATH.
2. Edit ~/.Xclients to look like this:
    #!/bin/sh
    xterm &
    xbiff &
    twm

and type startx.

twm is another window manager that will always be there. If this works
we have a good start.

3. Now find the executable for fvwm95-2. /usr/lib/X11 is a strange place
for the executable to live. Are you sure it isn't in /usr/bin/X11
(which is, in fact, just a symlink to /usr/X11R6/bin)?

Try substituting it for twm:

    #!/bin/sh
    xterm &
    xbiff &
    fvwm95-2


If none of this works send me the error messages and I'll try and figure
out what went wrong.

Also, if you like, take a look at /usr/X11R6/bin/startx to see what it
is doing. I'll send a copy of my simplified version later on when I have
some more time.

Joe;

  Just running the .xsession file will not work, it needs to be run 
by another process which is starting X.

 A few tips:
   1) you want that last line to be "exec" not "/exec".  I may have had
      a typo in my first e-mail.
      
   2) You probably need to set the .xsession file to executable, use
      the chmod command:  chmod u+x .xsession
      
   3) Ric was very correct in pointing out that I messed up my
      little sample .xsession file, you must put everything but the
      window manager in the background by adding an ampersand (i.e. &) to
      the end of each line (except the first and the last ones..)
      
         #! /bin/sh
	 /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm &
	 /usr/X11R6/bin/xbiff &
	 exec /usr/X11R6/bin/fvwm2
      
   4) I'm not sure that you have the right path to fvwm95-2.  The path
      you have (/usr/lib/X11/fvwm95-2) actually points to the configuration
      directory, not to the binary.  In UNIX packages install their
      binaries (a.k.a. the program you actually run) in a directory
      called bin.  You can tell if a file is a directory or a file
      with the ls command.  For example:
      
         romig> ls -ld /usr/lib/X11/fvwm95-2
	 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 1024 Nov 20  1997 /usr/lib/X11/fvwm95-2/
       and
         romig> ls -ld /usr/bin/X11/fvwm95-2
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 117636 Nov 20  1996 /usr/bin/X11/fvwm95-2
	
	
      Notice that the first listing has a "d" in the first column, but
      the other line does not.  This indicates that the first is a
      directory, the other a "normal" file.
    
   5) I don't know if the version of redHat you are using turns on
      the xdm automatically.  The xdm is a program which starts the
      X window system and puts up a login screen.  If you log in via
      graphical box in the middle of the screen you are using xdm, if
      you login via a textual prompt you are not using xdm.
      
      5a)  If you are using xdm, then then the .xsessions file will work,
           once you have made the adjustments I mention above.
	   
      5b)  You you are not using the xdm then (1) could start it, 
           probably by logging in as root and typing "/sbin/init 5"
	   or (2) you can use the startx script to start X. As Ric
	   mentioned, if you are using startx then the startx script
	   will read the .xinitrc file (or the .Xclients file as per Ric).
	   To use startx you login as yourself and type "startx".
	   
      5c)  What I do is make my .xinitrc file a link to my .xsession file,
           so either way I am working I get the same thing.  Create your
	   .xsession file and then type "ln -s ~/.xsession ~/.xinitrc".
	   

Let us know how it is going.
Phil

Hello!

I'm currently using the latest version of fvwm95 and having the problem
where fvwm95 does not recognize the settings in my .Xdefaults, namely
"clientDecoration" and "clientFunction" properties.

I would appreciate it very much if you would help me.
For different applications, I would like to have different window menus
(left hand of title bar popup selections), ie., some application windows
must have the Close/Maximize selections, some can only have the Maximize
but not the Close, etc...

If these properties are not controlled by .Xdefaults but fvwm95, could
you tell me how I can set them. I tried the "Style" option in my
.fvwm95rc but it still does not work.

Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.
Kim-

This is probably a no brainer.  But fvwm doesn't have anything in it that
uses th XX year format does it that might cause it to have problems later?
I don't think I saw any date code in it, but just in case I missed something
like the modules or good step that might cause something to fail?  I know
it's a pain unfortunately when you got people depending on the environment
to be stable, a window manager is probably something that needs close 
watching.

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a new release coming?
Is anybody still actively working on fvwm, or is
the current maintainer running out of time?
I haven't seen a release in ages. Not that I 
demand anything. Fvwm is free software after all.
I am just wondering what happened to this great
software.

Curious mind wants to know,

  Guenther

Richard,

      Where is the Xclients file stored? When I edit it from my home dir
I get a knew file.... Then when I run startx I get an error about Xclients
permission
denied. Any thoughts?

Yes. The system Xclients is in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit. As you will see
it is rather unnecessarily complex. However, if you create your own
.Xclients (note the dot at the front) it will override the system version.

I expect you are getting the error because your .Xclients hasn't got
executable permissions set. Do something like:

  chmod 755 .Xclients

or

  chmod u+x .Xclients

or some suitable executable permissions.


Good luck

As promised here are my stripped down versions of the xinit startup files.
I wrote these to provide a consistent and simple interface for my users
across several platforms.

startx lives in /usr/local/bin. It basically just runs xinit on the
xinitrc and xserverrc files. The user can override these files with
their own versions in ~/.xinitrc and ~/.xserverrc.

xinitrc, xserverrc and Xclients live in /usr/local/lib/xinit/. The
xinitrc sets up things like Xresources and xmodmap mappings, then
runs Xclients, or the user ~/.Xclients if it exists.

The vast majority of users just create their own .Xclients containing
a list of startup clients, then run startx.

(note: xsession is a nice program that starts the window manager for you
and then allows you to switch between window managers).

	The properties, or window manager hints, that you're trying to set
aren't *set* by the window manager, they're set by the application (Motif
apps, mostly). They are hints that a window manager may choose to honor or
not (FVWM lets you have it either way).

	FVWM has some Style settings that control how FVWM (or FVWM95) will
treat these hints. MWMDecor instructs FVWM to honor the various decoration
hints that Motif apps sometimes use to communicate with MWM. MWMFunctions
causes FVWM to honor the hints about what functions the app wants allowed,
and not to put a Maximize or Close function, etc., on its window-op menus
if the app has set a hint to say that it doesn't like that. HintOverride
causes the "forbidden" functions to appear on the menu greyed-out, so you
know that the app doesn't want you to use them; but clicking on them will
perform the actions anyway.

	There's also an OLDecor style that causes FVWM to try to honor hints
intended for olwm/olvwm. Frankly, I've never paid much attention to this one,
so I haven't any idea how effective it is - or even what the hints are.

	So, if you want FVWM to honor the hints that the app sets, try adding
a line like the following to your .fvwm2rc (or .fvwm2rc95)  --

	Style    "*"    MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, OLDecor


	This may give you what you want, but it may not, depending on a couple
of considerations.

	First, these Style options are all-or-nothing: you can't tell FVWM to
honor this function hint, but not that one.

	Second, FVWM has no control over the setting of these hints. If a given
application sets the hints according to an X resource setting, then you can
control whether FVWM will honor them or not; but it's all up to the app. If
these Style settings have no effect, then the apps you're trying to influence
don't pay any attention to the resources you're setting.

	I hope this long-winded explanation helps you out.

Hi folks,

I run Red Hat Linux 5.1 and Fvwm2 on my laptop.

I set myself up with an FvwmGoodStuff menubar today.  It takes up
less space than the TaskBar did (my Linux laptop is 640x480) and
is reminiscent of the SGI Indy on my desk at work (which I rarely
use since my laptop is cooler :).

The weirdness is as follows.

If, from FvwmGoodStuff, or from an FVWM menu popped up by FGS,
I launch (using Exec, Exec exec, or Exec tcsh -t exec ;)
an instance of xterm, nxterm (aka color-xterm) or rxvt,
and DON'T -e an interactive application, instead getting a 
command line shell (this includes having the xterm -e the shell, 
or having it -e a perl script that launches the shell, or even
having FGS Exec a perl script that launches the xterm), when
I *exit* that term window, FvwmGoodStuff dies too.

If I pop up an application in an Xterm that lets me start a new
shell in that Xterm, do so, then exit back to the application 
and exit the app, FvwmGoodStuff survives.

Yes, I have a & at the end of the command line. :)

I'm snagging TkGoodStuff as I type this, to see if I get different
results...

Any thoughts?

Hi,

I am using fvwm2 on my Debian 2.0 box and for the life of me I can't get 
the initfunction to execute xpmroot.  I know the command is right 
because it works from an xterm.  So how can I get it working properly 
and where abouts should i put it in my .fvwm2rc file?

Regards

Graham.

When I switched from slackware to debian a while ago, I had to go in
and add full paths to my .fvwm2rc. It seems that the PATH isn't set to 
include the X binaries when fvwm2 initalizes. Try adding the path
(/usr/bin/X11/xpmroot). 

Also, did you upgrade to debian from 1.3? On the machine that I
upgraded, I had an old-libc-compiled version of xpmroot in
/usr/local/bin.

Hello,

I would like the following feature/behavior to be implemented in Fvwm:

I click with a mouse button in the root window, a menu pops up 
and moves with the mouse while on top of everything until I
release the mouse button. When I release the mouse button the menu sticks
to the top of the window and I can then select the appropriate entry by
choosing it and clicking on it.
With this behavior, it is OK if menus are initially popped up slightly
out of the viewport, and do not automatically move the mouse pointer
when invoked with a click.

I think this would be a nice feature as it would give menus some of 
the flexibility that is given to windows.

Neil

Humble apologies if this is a repeat, I think my previous message didn't get
through.

We're running Solaris x86 HW 5/98, with DU3 (I've stuck the list of
relevant-looking patches at the bottom) on RM PC 6333 (PII/333MHz, 64MB, ATI
Rage Pro 8MB), and it all works fine, except ... fvwm-2.0.46 reliably hangs
the X server when trying to move a window off the screen (and certain other
resize operations when the window is on the edge of the screen).  I've
compiled it with gcc-2.8.1 and egcs-2.90.29, no change.  Has anyone got any
insights / suggestions on chasing this problem ?  Are we the only ones to have
seen it ?  Any comments would be well received, since people are in tears
about losing fvwm2.

Cheers,

Rob

Hi Xlib/Xprotocol hackers !

    I am currently trying to write an X11 client that send (with
XHi Xlib/Xprotocol hackers !SendEvent) fake X11 events (MotionEvent,
ButtonPress, KeyPress),
to control the pointer and the keyboard from an X client.
    But I have a problem: XSendEvent needs a target window ID.

    So, I try to get the window's id of the window under the pointer.
Currently, I use some code taken from `xwininfo' to get the whole tree
of
X11 windows (with XGetTree) and the geometry of each window to check
if the pointer is in. But that crazy way of finding the window id, do
not work when several windows are mapped at the same location since,
I do not know which window is on top.

    To solve the problem, I have two questions:

    - Is there a way to find the current visible window ?
    - Or, is there a much simpler Xlib call that can give
    me the window id under the cursor, since the X server
    always knows the current window id.

Thanks.

    Ludovic Drolez. (please reply by mail)

Time for a summary, I feel.  Thanks to the people who responded (some of whom
responded before I got the message myself), especially to Shriman Gurung,
William Austin, and David Grindrod, though the others that reported they
either did or did not have the problem also provided useful information.

The original problem:

Compiling with Sun's cc made no difference either.  fvwm is reported to work
fine on 2.6 and 2.7 with Xsun, although a) the version tried was compiled with
the Xfree86 libraries, and b) the graphics card involved was a Matrox
Millenium II.  Others have had exactly the same problem with the ATI Rage Pro
8MB, and tvtwm is reported to have the same problem, but less reproducibly.

I have grabbed the Xfree86 X server, and got it working after a bit of a fight
before I realised it wanted to write to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/compiled
(mutter, mutter ... who puts scratch directories in /usr): the problem appears
to have gone away using the same binary of fvwm2, compiled with the libraries
from /usr/openwin.  I.e. all I have done is replace the X server and the
problem has gone.

In summary, it looks like fvwm was tickling a bug in Sun's X server, which may 
be related to the graphics card in use.

This patch provides a window attraction mechanism similar to KDE's window snap.
When moving a window if it is with SnapAttraction pixels of another window
it will position itself flush with the other window.  It is my favorite
aspect of KDE's wm so I added here (since I like everything else about

That would be a GREAT feature -- iff you can use as a Style parameter,
thereby being able to selectively enable/disbale on a per Style basis.

For instance, maybe i only want my Gimp pallets to snap to other
windows.

Alternatively, you might want to selectively turn off the ability for
other windows to snap to you:

Maybe sticky windows should not be snapped to. Also windows that are
always-on-top or always-on-bottom.  

Wharf, Fwvmbuttons, the pager maybe should not be snapped to.

I say let the user decide these things by adding the appropriate
variables.

Yeah, the current patch is just a global effect.  However, I have been 
trying to work out exactly where to go with this.  The Style this is
probably easy enough, but I was thinking along the lines of window groups.
If it were easy to associate groups of windows (either by direct interaction
on instances, or by type ala Styles) one could move groups of windows.

So in your gimp example you could move your gimp group all at once w/o 
interfereing with other windows.

Hello,

I like to bind actions to menus (don't we all).
Many nice programs are terminal based so I like to invoke them with:

Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e <program-name>

or something similar.

When I invoke the following line from within an xterm things behave as
expected:

/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/bin/rtin   

... but when I use the action

Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/bin/rtin

in my .fvwm2rc file, things no longer work. The action, which in my case is 

bound to a menu, just pops up an xterm which then promptly disappears.

This is frustrating because stuff like:

Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/bin/pine

works just fine.

How can I fix this problem, and where did I go wrong?

Thanks,

Neil

Hi,
My worksite is into Solaris/CDE. I'm looking to masqurade my SparcLinux
box. Is there a CDE-like configuration of fvwm2, and if so where can I
download it from.

Thanks

Hey guys,
I haven't used this mailing list before, so I don't know if this will
work, but I am Cobalt over at themes.org, and I have started up
fvwm.themes.org.  I would like you all to send in your themes so that we
can get some FVWM themes up...
Thanks

Hello,

I am using the following function:

AddToFunc Raise-and-Move "I" Raise
+                        "M" Raise
+                        "M" Move

What I don't like about it is I have to wait for ClickTime for the covered
parts of a window to be redrawn when raised with Raise-and-Move.

Can anyone suggest anything other than setting ClickTime to zero?

Thanks,

Neil

Hello,

The following doesn't seem to be working the way it should:

AddToFunc Raise-Resize "C" Raise
+                      "M" Raise
+                      "M" Resize

Can anyone confirm this?
I am running fvwm 2.0.46.

Best Regards,

Thanks,

Neil Zanella

Hello,

Was someone on this mailing list looking for the Pie Window Manager sometime
ago? It's available at ftp.crynwr.com in the /piewm directory as 
piewm-1.03.tar.gz

Using 'Style "*" NoIcons' in .fvwm2rc hides the icon image as well as the icon
text.  I want to just suppress the icon images.  Some applications such as rxvt
don't display an icon image but others do such as Netscape. ??

Is there a way to get the desired results?

I'm using fvwm2 2.0.45 and I'm having problems getting my titlebars to come 
out nicely rounded in a 3D effect.  The snippet I'm using at the moment is:

TitleStyle	Centered
AddTitleStyle	ActiveUp VGradient 128 cyan3 white Raised
AddTitleStyle	ActiveDown VGradient 128 cyan3 white Raised
AddTitleStyle	Inactive VGradient 128 #c06077 white Raised

This leaves the titlebars in a flat appearing bar.  Anybody got any clues?

Just to be different I would like the converse, namely icons but no
text. I think I asked about this in the dim and distant past but got no
replies.

Cheers

Norway								Asker 20th October  98



Dear Sir or Madam:

As you are aware, the advent of the year 2000 has generated many issues and
problems within the IT industry, and we have underway a project to
investigate the impact and consequences on Schlumberger.  As part of this
project, we need to determine the status of Year 2000 compliance of
products and services supplied to us by our vendors.
The concept of Year 2000 compliance is:
the product will continue to function, and its functionality and accuracy
(both logical and mathematical) will not be affected as a result of the
"run date" or the dates being processed (irrespective of century), and the
product recognizes February 29, 2000 as a valid date.
On the attachment, we list the products you supply to us (together with
release version).  For each of these products, please indicate:

Is the designated release version Year 2000 Compliant?
If "yes", then:

1. How does the product implement Year 2000 Compliance? -- e.g., full ISO
Standard 8601 standard date format, logical interpretation of a 2-digit
date, date windowing, etc.?)
=20
2. Are any of the previous release versions Year 2000 Compliant?  Which=
 ones?
=20
3. Is compliance dependent on other product release versions being in use
(e.g., of operating systems)?
=20
4. If your product uses components from other suppliers, have you ensured
that they are also Year 2000 Compliant?
=20
5. Can you demonstrate Year 2000 Compliance if requested (at a user site or
at your test site?

If "no", then:

1.  What type of non-compliance exists:=20
=B7 will the product continue to run but not produce Year 2000 Compliant
results?
-- or --
=B7 will the product fail?
2.  Is a Year 2000 Compliant version planned, and when will it be released?
3.  If a compliant version is planned, how will compliance be achieved
(e.g., expansion of the dates fields to ISO 8601 standard date format,=
 etc.)?
4.	To help quantify the upgrade effort, please indicate any additional
processes that will be required beyond a normal "installation" process.
5.	Will there be any additional cost to us for a Year 2000 compliant
version?  If so, how much?
6.	If our current release version is not Year 2000 Compliant, indicate when
failures related to the century date change may begin to occur or manifest,
and what types of problems may ensue.  (In our experience, in some cases
this may be before January 1, 2000.)

We would very much appreciate your response to this inquiry by 16th of
November 98.  We appreciate that this request may require some time and
effort on your part; in advance, we thank you for your help.  We are sure
that Year 2000 compliance issues are of interest to your other customers,
and to you as a customer of your own suppliers, and we share with you hopes
for a smooth move through to the next century.

Please see attachment.





Yours faithfully

This is a very nice patch.  It reminds me of ctwm with its MovePack
command.  Did you know about the fvwm-workers list?  It's on the same
server as the fvwm list and were up to version 2.0.47d so far.  By the
way your patch does work with the latest but I had to manually apply tha
patches as several files had been changed in going to 2.0.47 and the
line numbers didn't match up.

Cheers,
Tim.

When using the 'switch to' function from the root menu, the mouse always
warps to the top right corner of the window I'm switching to. Also when
navigating through cascading menus, the pointer always warps to the top of
the new menu.

How can I disable all mouse warping so that the mouse only goes where I
specifically point it to?

Thanks,

Marc Greene

I used to do exactly this, by saying something like:

  Style "*" Icon none

where "none" doesn't exist as a pixmap in your path.

I don't think this is possible. I tried

  Iconfont none

but it just defaults to fixed. A patch might not be too hard.

I do something like this:

  AddToDecor foo
  ...
  + TitleStyle Inactive   (VGradient 32 Cyan Black -- Raised)
  + TitleStyle ActiveUp   (VGradient 32 Cyan Black -- Raised)
  + TitleStyle ActiveDown (VGradient 32 Black Cyan -- Flat)
  ...

The decor syntax is somewhat ... strange ... :-)

This works for most applications.  Thanks.  It still fails for Netscape
but I am looking into the X resource to modify to make it work.

Aha! It's been a long time since I used this stuff (I use FvwmIconMan
now), but I just dug back into some of my old code. The following patch
should do the trick for you. Apply it to fvwm/icons.c, then say:

  Style "*" Icon NoPixmap

to override the icon set by the application.

I really thought the patch had been included into the distribution
by Chuck back around 2.0.44.

Brady ... want to stick it into the 2.0.47 beta? It's pretty trivial.


Anyway, here it is:

This didn't work but when I commented out the 2 functions above your diff
change, I got it to work.

   if (!(tmp_win->flags & NOICON_TITLE)||(tmp_win->icon_p_height == 0))  

Commenting out GetIconBitmap(tmp_win) is what really did it, I think.

The icon text however is no longer trimmed regardless of the value of the width
parameter.  Strange.

I'm going to investigate FvwmIconMan, since it nearly does what I am looking
for.

Great site!

I'd like to volunteer the contents of my fvwm themes site, too...

  http://www.vis.colostate.edu/~scriven/fvwm.php3

The setup there allows multiple themes to coexist, so that the user can
select one from a menu and change the appearance without restarting
Fvwm.  The default behavior is to randomly pick a theme upon each X
login.  I'll be gradually incorporating the themes on fvwm.themes.org
into my own setup, as I find themes I like.  :)

However, the "themes" on my page do not include root-window images. 
Those are available on a separate page.  I have plans to incorporate
both together, but it'll take a little while.  (each theme will randomly
pick a background which matches its colors)


Just my $0.02, if you care to use it..

Hmm, strange, I seem to remember it working fine. I used to have a setup
close to what you're trying to achieve. Maybe the logic is a little
screwy (need 'else if' in a couple of places). At a cursory glance
it seems some of that section would benefit from a bit of a rewrite
anyway.


> Commenting out GetIconBitmap(tmp_win) is what really did it, I think.

Yup, Netscape is passing the pixmap hint to the WM, causing that
pixmap to be used.

I know what is happening here. With icon pixmaps the pixmap width is
used to calculate the width of the whole icon. When I first started using
no pixmaps on the icons I found that fvwm calculated the width based
on the icon title string length. This was OK, but some apps change
their icon title frequently (e.g. netscape urls, xterms which show CWD
in the title, etc). I decided I wanted the icon to grow or shrink with the
title on each iconify event. The following patch, which was adopted
into the main distribution, does that:

Looking at this it would probably be pretty straightforward to change
the behaviour so that, for example, all icons are say 64 pixels wide,
but show the full title when focussed. If that is what you want.

And I've just found *another* patch I did so that the icon gets dynamically
resized every time the icon title changes (without needing to manually
deiconify and iconify again). I don't think this one was adopted for some
reason.

I might play around with some of this stuff sometime soon and put it
all into one patch for Brady to check out.

It looks like you've a bit more work to do on Y2K. :-)


But seriously, you have access to the free source code and it your own
responsibility to check for Y2K compliance.  Nobody else will provide
a guarantee.  (Unless perhaps you pay a Y2K consultant to do it for
you.)

Hello !

Im invoking fvmw with fvmw2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc" and after the
start-up I cant change to the next pages by moving the mouse to the
screen edges. I first have to select a page via pager and after that
everything is ok.
This occures even if there are no m4 makros in the init file.
On the other hand, if I start fvwm without the FvwmM4 command (and no m4
makros)
everything is normal.
Has anybody a answer to this behaviour ??

Juergen

Subject: FVWM: On laptopm fvwm2 taskbar does an incomplete job of autohiding
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I have the same Red Hat Linux 5.1 installed on a Compaq Armada 4120 laptop
and for comparison on a generic desktop PC. I use XF86 with the
AnotherLevel window manager, and both work well on both computers.
 
On the laptop, however, I get a frustrating piece of behavior.  When I enable
FvwmTaskBarAutoHide, the taskbar slides downwards only 2/5 of the way instead
of completely disappering from view! It moves down gracefully and repeatably,
but it just fails to go down all the way. On the desktop computer the taskbar
autohides well.
 
On the laptop I have the Cirrus Logic GD7548 chipset at 800x600. I doubt
that this is a hardware problem or a true fvwm2 bug.
Could the problem be due to some misunderstanding between fvwm2 and X about
the size of the screen---something I can fix with a better XF86Config file?
Note however that everything else in X seems to be working just fine.

Any lights about the nature of the problem and how to address it?
 
Thanks.

This may not be the appropriate place to ask but I'll make it quick.

I'm trying to figure out what color depth I'm running FVWM2 in.  I've
started looks at pictures with xv and they do not get all of the picture's
color palette.  My graphics card can handle many colors (at least 32bit).
Is there a way to check the setting after loading FVWM2?  I was looking in
the XF86Config file and it looks like it is set to 32bit, but that doesn't
make sense with the strange colors I'm experiencing.  Title bar gradient
fill wouldn't do that would it?

Thanks for your help.

Adrian

Unlikely, but how have you get them set?

According to the man page the maximum colors for the gradient is 128 colors.

You can verify what visuals (X color depths) your X server is providing with
xdpyinfo.

Which visuals your application is using can often be verified with xwininfo and
then selecting a window your application is displaying.

Thanks for everyone's input.  I will try 'xdpyinfo' and see where I am.
Hopefully I will learn that I am somehow using a smaller color depth than I
thought I was using.

	Titlebar gradients shouldn't cause this problem. First, as somebody
else mentioned, try running xdpyinfo to find out what visuals your X server
supports. Then try experimenting with xv's -visual command line option.

	xv tries to determine the best visual to use, but doesn't always
make the best choice with some of the newer server/card combinations.
I'd start by trying

		xv -visual default

(that's what I use with AcceleratedX). I'll bet that works, but if it
doesn't give you the right results, try -visual TrueColor or -visual
DirectColor (assuming xdpyinfo says the server supports those).

Where is the default location for FVWM error messages?  I'm trying to figure
out why FVWM hangs during loading.  Perhaps there is some error that can
point me to the answer.

When FVWM hangs (at a completely blank screen) all I can do is power off the
computer.  This happens maybe 20% of the time.  I am wondering if it has
something to do with the graphics card hardware, but I wouldn't know how to
decide that that is the case.  I don't recall the exact model at the moment.

    I am having a problem with FVWM not behaving the same as
mwm when I set the TransientFor hint property. What I am trying to
do is make the window of a separate task behave like it is a dialog
of my main task. I am doing the following steps:

1) Run my program called 'MyTask'
2) MyTask spawns the standalone FontSel program using a pipe
    to get the selected font from FontSel's standard output.
3) MyTask looks for the WindowID of FontSel based on its window
    name using a timer and QueryTree().
4) When MyTask finds the WindowID of FontSel, it calls
    XSetTransientForHint() using the WindowID of MyTask
    as the parent window and the found WindowID of FontSel
    as the dialog window.

    When I do this under mwm, the stacking order is maintained
so that clicking on the window for MyTask will caused the window
for FontSel to be raised as well. Under FVWM, the two windows
continue to operate independently and clicking on the window for
MyTask raises it in front of the window for FontSel.

    When I saw that this technique didn't work under FVWM,
I tried setting the windowgroup for the FontSel window to the
WindowID of MyTask, but this didn't work either.

Not sure, but you could try looking at the options for MWMxxx and
HintOveride

they are all documented in the man page.

See if that helps,

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


I'm using Fvwm Version 1.24r and XFree86 3.3.1. I have successfully enabled
MouseKeys (part of the X Keyboard Extension) (including button clicks via the
keyboard) using info found at ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/faqs/FAQ.  

I'm having two problems:

1) Mouse motion is slow --- 1 pixel per key repeat. Therefore, could someone
please point me toward documentation on configuring MouseKeys from the  X
Keyboard (XKB) Extension? (I apologize that this is not really an fvwm issue,
but I'm guessing some of you out there might know and I'd appreciate your
indulgence.)  

2) After enabling Mousekeys, some of my fvwm configurations seem to get messed
up. In particular, I have 

Mouse 1         W       M       RaiseLower

in my .fvwmrc, which lowers windows by meta-clicking anywhere in the
window. Restarting fvwm doesn't seem to do the trick. Neither does disabling
MouseKeys. Any suggestions/fixes?

Thanks very much.

We to have had a long standing problem with fvwm and applications compiled
against Motif libraries. The apps will not start! The current "trick that
works" is to start Netscape before you run a "problem" app, as it seems to
set things in a way that will allow apps following to run. This is of course
stupid. 

I have attached a bug report on the issue, which mentions another "trick
that sometimes works", but it a much smaller and faster trick then starting
Netscape, eating lots of memory, starting big app, eating rest of memory,
swap, swap, swap....

I spent a number of hours last night looking at how Fvwm handles the Motif
Intrinsics, and wanted to gag. If you look at the AfterStep source and see
all the motif-isms that had to comment out you will quickly see that the
routines in decorations.c code is in need of some changes (SelectDecor(),
GetMwmHints(), GetOlHints(). If you look at the Enlightment source, you will
see a better handling of the MwmHints. Fixing this will help Fvwm better
manage and expand its lookand feel as well.

Right now MWM and OLWM are in a twisted mess in the Fvwm code.

After the next release (yes I agree with the soon), this code needs help.

There should be either an FVWM_FLAGS or an fvwm_structure set, such that is 
the union of what other WM apps may present to it can be used in the code,
and not rely on MWM_FLAGS as is done now. The WM_app code should be kept in
their specific GetXXXHints() routines, and only the fvwm_structure should 
get out, as well as go through the rest.

It look to me like it should (with lots of hand waving here);

GetFvwmHints()     // What did the .fvwmrc+running_state give us. (WMHints)
                   // i.e. first load fvwm_structure with the look we want.
GetMwmHints()      // If this is a Motif app find our compromise
GetOlwmHints()     // If this is an Open Look app find our compromise
GetGnomeHints()    // If this is a Gnome app find our compromise
GetXyzHints()      // If this is an Xyz app find our compromise
SelectDecor()      // A much cleaner routine that takes the final
                   // fvwm_structure and presents it to Fvwm_core.

These routines are all called from AddWindow(), and could be put in their
own routine and .c file GetHints() and hints.c. I think this is central 
to the great "style" changes.

The existing code was good from that standpoint that it was how twm was
given the mwm look and feel. There are now more looks and feels, and this
needs to be reorganized, so we do not end up with endless source or
CVS branches for every fvwm spinoff. A cleaner API would help various
factions to work together.

I looked in the code for FVWM to see what it was doing
when the TransientFor property hint was set for a window
and saw that it does nothing. So I added a bit of code
to handle the situation and voila, problem solved. Below
is the code fragment that I added to events.c to fix the
problem. With this modification, FVWM acts the same
as mwm when the TransientFor property is changed.

The following code should be inserted before the default
case in the function HandlePropertyNotify() in the file
events.c.

----------------------- Begin Insert ---------------------------
    case XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR:
      {
	if(XGetTransientForHint(dpy, Tmp_win->w, 
&Tmp_win>transientfor))
	{
	   Tmp_win->flags |= TRANSIENT;
	   RaiseWindow(Tmp_win);
	}
	else
	{
	   Tmp_win->flags &= ~TRANSIENT;
	}
-------------------- End Insert -----------------------------

My code fragment was too short. I missed the closing bracket
and 'break;' statement when I cut and pasted the code.

The following code should be inserted before the default
case in the function HandlePropertyNotify() in the file
events.c.

----------------------- Begin Insert ---------------------------
    case XA_WM_TRANSIENT_FOR:
      {

      }

This is driving me nuts, over the last couple of weeks I've asked on
comp.os.linux.x and comp.windows.x, but no responses. I've also trawled
the mailing list archive.

Before starting X windows I run:

	PS1="myprompt> "
        export PS1

I then start X with 'startx'. The system's default window manager is
fvwm2.  Then I choose 'xterm' by clicking on the background to activate
the system wide wm menu and selecting 'xterm'. And my PS1 setting has
been lost!

I moved my .profile, .bash*, .fvwm2rc, .xsession, .xinitrc, .Xresources
files out of the way, logged out and in and repeated the above and it
still did the same thing.

I switched to 'twm' instead of fvwm2 and exactly the same thing happened.

I tried marking PS1 readonly before starting X, but the same thing
happened.

System wide config files might be changing PS1, but I couldn't see
anything in /etc/X11/*wm/* nor in /etc/profile, nor in the window
manager's manual page or other documentation.

Nor is it a bash problem. Bash sets PS1 to its own default when it
doesn't see a PS1 in the environment to inherit. The next test I did
proved that:

I've narrowed the problem down to the window manager specifically, by
running 'xterm &' without options from my .xsession file, and by adding a
menu option to do the same to my personal .fvwm2rc file. The one started
by the .xinitrc has PS1 preserved. But the one started by fvwm2 (which
is in turn also started by .xinitrc) loses the PS1 setting. (.Xresources
has been moved out of the way, so it's nothing to do with changing the
'loginShell' X resource between the two invocations of xterm.) 

This diagram might make the process tree and environment inheritance
clearer:

                        login shell (I set PS1)
                             |
                          startx
                             |
                         <whatever>
                             |
           .xinitrc/global-equivalents (PS1 still set)
	                    /  \		
	                  /      \		
	                /          \		
                   fvwm2/twm      xterm (PS1 still set)
                       |            |
                xterm (PS1 lost)   bash (PS1 still set)
                       |
        bash (PS1 set to bash's default)

I've even simpified the startup by running 'xinit /usr/bin/X11/fvwm2'
and 'xinit /usr/bin/X11/xterm'. The second one keeps the correct PS1
setting, whereas an xterm started from the first one has PS1 reset.

( I tried doing a 'strace' on 'xinit /usr/bin/X11/fvwm2', but stracing
subprocesses (-f option) fails because of some process attachment problem
that I haven't worked out yet. I realise a strace wouldn't show a change
in PS1, but it might have shown a config file load or something else
that might have helped me suss out what's going on. )

It's a Debian 2.0 system, and the fvwm2/twm/bash package maintainers (I
guess) works around this 'feature' by setting PS1 in .bashrc - i.e. PS1
is set on every single subshell startup. Unfortunately ...

Unfortunately this breaks some scripts I run, which like to set PS1
before starting user-requested interactive sub-shell. (They do this to
remind the user that they're still in the script.) So I had to remove
the PS1 setting from .bashrc again. (These scripts work fine in a non-X
environment, they also work fine from an X session, which uses 'xterm'
as a low-tech window manager!)  Which brings me back to a lost PS1 in 
shells spawned by the window manager.

So, in a nutshell, the fvwm2 and twm window managers leave all my other
variables alone, they just unset PS1. 

So, the question is, please, why are they unsetting it, and how do I 
stop them? Also, just so I don't go totally insane, can anyone just 
verify that they get the same thing? 

Thanks for reading all the way to the end!

Alexis

My guess is that the reason for your problem is that
the xterm from inside the window manager is not started
in the correct environment. Nobody actually unsets PS1.
What you get is probably the default bash prompt because
PS1 is empty when the shell starts. Having a look at
which variables are actually set might help.

>From the console set 

foo=bar
export foo

and start X, fvwm2 and an X terminal, verify if foo is
still set and post the result.

Well, PS1 isn't empty before I start, and it *is* exported :-(

Ok, I tried it and the results are reproduced below. Summarising; PS1 is
still getting reset, but 'foo' makes it through without changes.

Dominik, or somebody else, if you could please just try what I did, and get
the *right* results, then that would give me the impetus to keep digging with
this - right now I feel like I'm going insane! :-)

If you could just move /etc/bashrc and all possibly relevent dot files out
of the way and do two runs as follows:

PS1="myprompt> "
export PS1
xinit /usr/bin/X11/xterm

[ when the xterm comes up do ]

echo $PS1

and the second run:

PS1="myprompt> "
export PS1
xinit /usr/bin/X11/xterm

[ when fvwm2 comes up do, start an xterm and when that comes up do ]

echo $PS1

I'd be very grateful, even if your results produce the right results unlike
mine.

Ok, the rest of this post is the 'foo' experiment, coupled with a PS1
experiment:

mynewprompt>

... and there is PS1 being set to it's the default (as mentioned in the 
bash man page), suggesting to me that it's *not* actully being explicitly
*set*, but rather explicitly *unset*.

I have no .profile, no .fvwm2rc, no .Xresource, no .bashrc. The is no
/etc/bashrc, but there is a /etc/profile, which sets PS1:

mynewprompt> grep PS1 /etc/profile
PS1="\\$ "
export PATH PS1
mynewprompt>

But since I neither start off with that value, nor does it change to that 
in either the xinit'ed xterm or the xinit'ed-fvwm2'ed xterm, I don't believe
/etc/profile is getting sourced.

Going back to my process diagram tree:

                        login shell (I set PS1)
                             |
                          startx
                             |
                           xinit
                             |
           .xinitrc/.xsession/global-equivalents (PS1 still set)
                            /  \
                          /      \
                        /          \
                   fvwm2/twm      xterm (PS1 still set)
                       |            |
                xterm (PS1 lost)   bash (PS1 still set)
                       |
        bash (PS1 set to bash's default)

Notice that when .xinitrc is executing the environment is still set correctly,
but the two bashes under them, one is right and one is wrong. And the only
difference in the two branches is that one comes through fvwm2 and the other
doesn't. I'm convinced that it is something fvwm2 is doing - perhaps 
indirectly (sourcing some file I don't know about perhaps).

Dominik, please, just for my sanity, could you move your dot-files out of the
way and try it? I mean, just to hear that someone had reproduced exactly 
what I have done and *didn't* get the same results would at least give me
the confidence to keep struggling with it.

Thanks!
