The reason why I was wanting to do this is that the SSH X11-Ask-Pass gets
launched to alllow the user to enter there passphrase which
gets added to there ssh-agent.  This then sets to environment variable that the
SSH client will use to connect to other systems.  I will try
the method that you have given me. Many Thanks.

Well, I guess we should put that information on the screen shots

hi,

I've got the following in my .fvwm2rc:

Mouse 3 W M Resize
Mouse 1 W M Move

It sometimes doesn't work with emacs, sometimes it does. If it doesn't
work, then restarting fvwm fixes it. I've tried running
global-unset-key in emacs, but it didn't fix the problem.

I'm running fvwm ver 2.5.4.

Thanks in advance,
Peter

I'm not sure where mozilla saves its position, but it usually
saves it when you close (not "kill -9") the last window.  I have
just

  Style * NoPPosition

which prevents mozilla from forcing its window positions.  Maybe
you have the wrong style name?

  Style mozilla-bin NoPPosition

should work too, but to make sure you can add

  Style mozilla-bin FixedPPosition

(which is new in 2.5.x).

Should be fairly easy once you understand how enter/leave events

Disabling some of the borders is easy to implement, but drawing
them so that they are not just cut off is more difficult.  It's
somewhere in the middle of my to do list.

What we really need is to allow calling an external program that
filters and sorts the windows and generates the labels of the menu
entries.

I can't promise how long it will take, but a generic soring

I think you can do some magic with the EwmhBaseStrut command and
the EWMHUseStrutHints, PlacementOverlapPenalties and
PlacementOverlapPercentPenalties Styles.  This is all new in
2.5.x.  Try this:

  EwmhBaseStrut 0 576 0 432
  style * EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
  style * placementoverlappenalties 1 5 10 1 0.05 1000, minoverlapplacement

By the way, I think all the

  ...Strut

stuff is misnamed.  It should all be named

  ...Struts
         ^^^

And I think

  PlacementOverlap(Percent)Penalties

should be renamed to

  MinOverlap(Percent)PlacementPenalties

So, don't be surprised when the old names stop working in future
2.5.x releases.

Also, I think the arguments of the EwmhBaseStrut command should
use "percent of screen size" as the default unit, not "pixels",
since virtually all other commands work like this.  The new
syntax would the be

  EwmhBaseStrut 0p 576p 0p 432p

Olivier:  I can't find anything about the EWMH related code in
the NEWS file.

Is "sometimes" by any chance when the window is lowered and/or
unfocused?  If so,

  Style * FPAllowFocusClickFunction, FPAllowRaiseClickFunction  

should help.  Even if it does help, please post all your focus
related configuration lines.  And did you have the same problem
with earlier releases?

I rewrote the code handling window focus a while ago and had to
break compatibility at a few places, but this one was not
intended.

This is an excerpt of /etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc

The file menudefs.hook exists, and if I manually edit it, the menus
change, but I want that menus are updated every time I add/remove a
program.

> but in the meantime... what happens when you run update-menus?

$ update-menus
$

nothing happens.

Maybe you will be interested that XFree current cvs can change the
screen resolution dynamically (so XFree-4.3 will be able to do this).
This is done using the xrandr utilities. However, fvwm does not
support Randr yet.

There is this in tne NEWS file:

Changes in alpha release 2.5.0 (27-Jan-2002)

[snip]

* Fvwm respect the extended window manager hints
  specification. This allows fvwm to work with KDE version >= 2
  and GNOME version 2. This support is configurable using a bunch
  of new commands and style options, search for "EWMH" in the man
  page.

Here is what is available now.

In 2.5.4 try either SortByResource or SortByClass options to WindowList.
The first one sorts xterms and rxvts separately, the second mixes them.

Richard Lister said he wrote a module that does a customized sorting,
maybe he may change it to create submenus instead. In any case this will
be available in one or another form in the next versions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Great, thanks. It is clearly stated in the man page in the
section you point to (keyboard shortcuts). 

Just for the benefit of the archive, the above statement

   >  with control: 100 pixels

should be changed to 
   
   with shift : 100 pixels
        ^^^^^

excellent feature, I must say ! :-)

thanks,

denis

I see.  For searching purposes, every new command and style should

I guess it's advertising too, but to me it suggests they don't think
I'm smart enough to ever need to do something with other windows on 
the screen while I'm waiting for their application to start up.

Ok, I've got it figured out. Sometimes is: whenever emacs is started
within the current fvwm session. Examples:
X loads... start up emacs == Can't resize with mouse bindings.
Restart fvwm (without quitting X) == Resize emacs no problem.
Close emacs, and then reopen == can't resize with mouse bindings.

Sorry, I can't remember if my old unstable .deb (2.4.8 I think) had
this problem. Maybe, though, as this little annoyance has been on my
wmpinboard todo list for a while.

Here's all my Style "*"s that I thought may be related (or I didn't
know what they did, they were just in the example rc file I started
with):

Note that I tried to turn each of these three off one at a time, but
it didn't solve my problem.
Style "*" MouseFocusClickRaises
Style "*" SloppyFocus
Style "*" GrabFocus

Style "*" MWMFunctions
Style "*" MWMBorder
Style "*" MWMDecor
Style "*" DecorateTransient
Style "*" SmartPlacement
Style "*" NoPPosition
Style "*" MouseFocusClickRaises
Style "*" SloppyFocus
Style "*" GrabFocus

Thanks again,
Peter =)

Hi :

Giving the latest unstable release a try but when running 'configure' I get the
following error message :

checking build system type... Invalid configuration `-hp-hpux11.11': machine
`-hp' not recognized
configure: error: /bin/sh ./config.sub -hp-hpux11.11 failed

This worked okay on the previous release 2.4.12. Ideas ?

regards

Hi.

I'm a long-time FvwmTaskBar enthusiast.  It is the most efficient
desktop-clutter-reduction tool that I have encountered to date.

I have a suggestion for a feature, based on one of the few things
in GNOME that I actually like.  The Gnome Tasklist allows "task
grouping", in which multiple instances of a program are grouped in the
same taskbar icon.  Clicking on that icon pops up a menu showing
the titlebar entry of all instances, allowing one to choose any one
of them.

This effects an enormous space saving on my typical desktop.  I find
that just being able to group all terminals together and all edit
windows together allows me to keep a tasklist that monitors all clients
in all desktops using no more than 8-10 icons.  This makes the icons
readable and usable, while requiring only two lines of icons in the
tasklist.

In my opinion, this would be a great addition to FvwmTaskBar.

Best Regards,
Carlo Graziani

You need to find out what the key is bound to.
A program like "xev" or "xkeycaps" will help with this.

The windows key is normally set up as a modifier, meant to
be used along with other keys.  For example, for me its mod4,
so I use it in conjunction with F2 like this:

Key F2 A 4 Maximize grow grow

The same key is also known as Alt_L, but I can't bind an action
directly to Alt_L, but I think I could if I removed the modifier
from the key.

You might want to look at the xmodmap command for more information.

Take a look what xev has to say about these keys.
Chances are that these bindings will work for you with Shift pressed:

  Key Super_L  A  S  WindowList (CurrentPage) NoGeometry
  Key Super_R  A  S  WindowList Root c c SelectOnRelease "", NoDeskSort
  Key Menu     A  S  Menu MenuFvwmRoot

If you don't want to additionally press Shift to activate these keys,
replace "S" with "A".

Mikhael.

You can bind a single modifier press with FVWM. Try this:

  Key Shift_R A A Exec xterm

  #Key Shift_R A A -

I notice Windowlist has keybindings for windows when I
select it.. can I have keybindings(like those for the
windowlist) to walk the Root Menu/submenu items?

  Did you, perchance use {F11} for "fullscreen mode"?  In X, there isn't
a true fullscreen mode.  The Mozilla people emulate it in X by increasing
the window so that the decorations/borders are off the screen, and you
see nothing but the web page.  So far, so good.  However, upon returning
to "normal" mode ({F11} again) it's offset a bit for me too.  I define
the following key binding to maximize/restore a window with {ALT-M}

Key M   A       M       Maximize 100 100

Yes, any menu can have hot keys.

AddToMenu MenuFvwmRoot "Builtin Menu" Title"
+ "&1. XTerm" Exec xterm"
+ "&2. Setup Form" Module FvwmForm FvwmForm-Setup"
+ "&3. Setup 95 Script" Module FvwmScript"

The character after the ampersand (&) is the hot key.

Can any of you FVWM users out there provide pointers to a long-time
(though limited) FVWM user who's finally trying to upgrade to GNOME 
(but still use FVWM as the window manager)?

Maybe things like:

1. How far will I get with FVWM 2.4.6 (Debian's version 2.4.6-2 in woody)?

2. Can I get FVWM to account for the GNOME panels when placing windows?

3. Can I force the GNOME panels to act like regular windows (temporarily
   until I learn to control GNOME) e.g., take window decorations so I
   can manipulate them in general, or lower when I issue a function-key
   sequence?

Also, does anyone have any pointers to GNOME documentation regarding 
how to avoid wasting so much screen real estate (the two-row bar at the
bottom plus the menu bar at the top of the screen)?

Thanks,
Daniel

I do it all the time.

should go pretty far, but I suggest posibly running a recent cvs snapshot. 
They're very stable for me and work well.

Sure, you can get fvwm to ignore or obey all sorts of GNOME hints. Just 
read the manual.

See question 2. It's all covered somewhere in the docs :-)

GNOME is very pointy clicky. Just click your right mouse button on all 
sorts of stuff. Actually, I used to have two regular panels. I kept one 
open at my top left with the FVWM pager swallowed as well as a button for 
an xterm, mozilla, and a clock. Then one at the lower left which had a 
"Mini Commander" (really useful actually :-), a gnome programs menu, and a 
volume control all with the panel set to auto-hide. 

It was a pretty sweet setup all in all. I believe there's a screen shot of 
it on the FVWM website. Just look for my name :-) Gnome 1.x worked really 
well with fvwm2. There's a  control panel somewhere which will let you add 
fvwm2 as an available window manager and then switch to it. 

I HIGHLY recommend installing Ximian GNOME. It's a better distro of GNOME 
on top of your linux distro. They have install methods for each of the 
distributions. Just check out www.ximian.com ... It will save you TONS of 
time and frustration. Just make sure you have some nice bandwidth.

If you make mistakes or wanna start fresh, just delete all your .gnome* 
dirs, your .nautilus*, and some other things you don't recognize. 
Actually, it might help to have a list of your dot-files before you 
install this so you'll know what to delete once you know how to set things 
up right :-)

One thing that is a shame is that GNOME 2.x removed the swallow ability 
from the panel. I really loved the fact that I could use FVWM's pager with 
gnome. Now if I wanna use it, I've either gotta write a gnome-applet 
version (I'm really considering learning C to do this), or just run it 
outside of a panel (not at all elegant). 

One thing to remember: FVWM's Pager has got to be the best in the world 
:-)

On my system I use only one gnome panel, at the top of my screen.  I have its
size set to "Tiny (24 pixels)".  In it I have icons to launch some common
applications along with the gnome "Main Menu" icon, a mail check applet (set to
display either "No mail" or "x messages"), a gnomeicu (ICQ clone) applet, a
mixer applet, and a clock.  I find that this gives me everything that I need
without wasting too much space.  I'm running in 1024x768.

Have a look at http://www.humbug.net/shot1.png for an example (~100k).  I use
gnome 1.4 but I don't imagine it would be too drastically different in gnome 2.

Ah, the snapshots are really not this stable.  He will be better
of with the 2.4.13 release.

Hi all.

Im trying to set up FvwmWharf on my system, but I can't. I'd added some
*FvwmWharf settings on system.fvwm2rc, but I can't load the module and I
don't know where to look for logging errors. (Id read FvwmWharf man
page). Any help would be appreciated.

TIA

In the source distribution, in the modules/FvwmWharf directory,
there is a file "sample.style" that works.  Just read it in
then run the command "module FvwmWharf".

If you don't have the file, send mail to me, and I'll send you a copy.

I have the file, and it's working. Thanks.

One more question: the sample file does not have an example with Swallow
apps; i'd tried the FvwmWharf man page example using asclock, but i
didn't work. The asclock process appears in a window and the wharf
button is empty. Do you have an example on how to put swallowd apps in
wharf buttons?

thanks again and sorry for my english

fvwm prints its errors to stderr--try looking at the server where you 
started the X server (if you started it from a terminal), or try looking 
at ~/.xsession-errors or similar.  If errors aren't being printed to 
stderr and you can't seem to find where they're being redirected to, try 
creating an error (by, say, restarting fvwm2 with the FvwmWharf module 
failing) and doing 'ls -ltra ~' to see which files were recently changed.

I'm planning on putting dockapps in my button bar. 
I've read how the button bar is finicky regarding
swallowing dockapps.  Are there some basic "rules"
regarding the size of the button bar or buttonsize to
reduce the problems that could occur?

Rick

Hi,

I've been looking through the manpage for a half hour, and I can't
figure out how to get a window raised automatically when I use
"GotoPage".

Any help is appreciated,
Peter

Your best bet would probably be something like:


Key     Right   A       3       GotoPageRaise +1p 0p

DestroyFunc GotoPageRaise
AddToFunc GotoPageRaise
+ "I" GotoPage $*
+ "I" Next (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus) Raise


I was trying to have together something to memorize the last focused 
window on a page and switch back to it whenever that page is 
reactivated, but I've given up for the moment--fvwm can't double-expand 
$ variables and launching an external program for every page switch 
seems to be a bit excessive to me.  There might be a way to do it all 
internally, but I haven't figured out what that is yet.

What manual?  (The manual page?  It (in 2.4.6) doesn't seem to say much

I have a (home-brew) program that scans for new files so I can tell what
an installation or running something created.

Hi,

Sorry if this has been asked before. Just wondering if fvwm supports
tabbed windows like pwm:

Thanks.

  Suggestion.  Run FVWM as per normal and in...
  - Redhat linux up to 7.3, execute the command "panel" at startup
  - Redhat linux 8.0, execute the command "gnome-panel" at startup

  This gives you the Gnome panel, and the apps/applets if you've
installed them.

I guess one of the more recent releases. For example:

    With  GNOMEIgnoreHints  fvwm  ignores all GNOME hints for
    the window, even if  GNOME  compliance  is  compiled  in.
    This  is  useful for those pesky applications that try to
    be more clever than the user and use GNOME hints to force
    the window manager to ignore the user's preferences.  The
    GNOMEUseHints style switches back to the  default  behav-
    ior.

Maybe you need one of the newer stable releases.

I'm no expert, but I believe this should be a per-applicatoin decision,
rather than a feature of the window manager.  I use screen to have
multiple shells in one xterm window.  Others use the Konsole of the KDE
desktop, etc.

HTH,
Andi.

No, it's not supported.  Maybe at some time in the future, but
there are currently no plans to add that feature to the fvwm core.
It may be done in a module, though.

Is it?  The syntax is a bit tricky, but once you have understood
that it is quite easy to do.

Not really.  The biggest problem is to understand how to write
the config lines.

Hello,

I have customized the fvwm2rc file and checked for the Close/ Destroy/ 
Delete options. I have commented all these options in the $HOME/.fvwm/xxxx 
files (Created by the Windows 95 setup & Customized by me).  When analyzing, 
I found that, If I Right clicked with Control Key on the Motif application 
with a Frame, with out any Widget space( The Frame's Free space even I had 
widget in some other location in the Frame). I have changed the Style from 
Windows 95 to Motif style. Still I am facing the issue.

I found that this issue is not present in fvwm 1.24r version ( I tried with 
Motif style)

Can any one help me to found the Exact issue.

With Thanks and Regards,
L. Subbiah

Check your .fvwm2rc file for and delete/close/destroy functions.
With Close and Destroy, applications are closed even if they
ignore the "DeleteWindow" message.

There's an existing, though old, module that allows something like
this:

I haven't tried it out.

I constructed a module a while back that had tabbing as well as other
things, but it never really got stable enough where I proposed anyone
use it except as a prototype.

The ion-like pane capability is probably not worth the complexity, so I'm
considering a simplified non-paning rewrite that concentrates on just
the tabbing.  Paning looks cool, but I never really found a lot of real
world use for it in the window manager.

For the curious, take a look at http://imonk.com/baboon/FvwmPartition.
The second picture has two tabs over the clock.

I can't figure out from the above where you are clicking.

I can't figure out which button you are using either.
In the subject line it says "left mouse" and above it says
"right clicked".

Since you can't seem to find where the mouse binding is,
perhaps you should just override it.

The border fvwm puts around a window has 2 separate parts,
the frame which is the corners, and the sides.

To create a mouse binding for the corners, add this to the end of your
.fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1 F C Menu Move-or-raise

To create a mouse binding for the top/bottom and sides of the border
use this:

Mouse 1 S C Menu Move-or-raise

Replace "Menu Move-or-raise" with what you want Fvwm to do.

To just remove the binding, do this:

Mouse 1 S C -

The "Next ... Focus" command is what I've been doing... and while I
agree that running an external command with every page switch is
excessive... well... let's just say there are few things more powerful
than my desire to procrastinate doing my philosophy assignment.

and so I give you: fvwm-track-focus     *trumpets: ta-da*

use at your own risk... it stores the Focused window id's in a tmp
file, and then sends commands back to fvwm via PipeRead. I think it
would be better implemented as a Module, but I'm lazy, and my
p3:450mhz has no noticible delay doing it, so I'm happy. it's way
better than having to alt-tab every time I switch pages to find the
window I want.

here's what I added to my .fvwm2rc:
PipeRead 'fvwm-track-focus /home/pmcalpin/tmp/fvwm.tf.dat init'

DestroyFunc GotoPageRaise
AddToFunc GotoPageRaise
     + "I" Current PipeRead 'fvwm-track-focus /home/pmcalpin/tmp/fvwm.tf.dat $[page.nx] $[page.ny] $w'
     + "I" GotoPage $0 $1
     + "I" PipeRead 'fvwm-track-focus /home/pmcalpin/tmp/fvwm.tf.dat $0 $1'

and then an example binding is:
Key KP_Home  A N  GotoPageRaise  0 0

don't forget to change what I've done for your own system... I assume
your paths are different than mine. You probably want to look at
fvwm-track-focus.c before you compile, too.

enjoy (or not),
peter =)

Hi all.

Is it possible to configure a dockable app (wmcube) as icon for other
application (xconsole) in FVWM 2.4.6? If yes, how?

thanks in advance

I dont' believe fvwm has it, and it would be a Good Thing to have. 
(Why do I say "don't believe"? Well, it looks like you can move 
diagonally to a submenu item, but that seems more due to the submenu 
not collapsing as long as no new submenu pops up.)

I think you are looking for

Actually Victor is looking more for PopdownDelay, something like:

  MenuStyle * PopupDelayed, PopupDelay 100, PopdownDelayed, PopdownDelay 200

I don't know, I don't have any popdown delays configured, and
I could do anything the web page mentioned.
It looks to me like either one does the job.

The directional stuff in the Mac sounded interesting, but I think
FVWM with all its configurability would look pretty good in any
comparison.

This is because "PopdownDelayed, PopdownDelay 150" is a default.
But who knows, maybe someone has PopdownImmediately in the config he uses.

hey, I think I've asked this question before, but I don't remember
getting a response.

If I run emacs or opera (the only two programs I've observed with this
problem), the two mouse bindings I use to resize/move windows don't
work... UNLESS I do a Restart command.

I'm not sure what's going on here. I tested xchat, gnome-terminal,
xterm, gimp, mozilla and zsnes, and I don't have any problems... so
far just emacs and opera.

Here are the mouse bindings:
Mouse 3 W M Resize
Mouse 1 W M Move

My .fvwm2rc is at:
www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/fvwm2rc

thanks in advance,
Peter =)

If you want to experiment with the delay values, set this:

  MenuStyle * PopupActiveArea 100

so there are no special effects on the right side of a menu.

Delays are working this way. A menu is not popped up until a submenu item
is not selected for PopupDelayed milliseconds. If you move to another
submenu item, the countdown is started again.

A menu is going away only after it is not selected for PopdownDelayed
milliseconds. So here you can't configure a speed of the allowed deviation
only the time of such deviation by that you should reach a submenu.

Does not that page say just this? "The time delay is quite small, so the
move has to be pretty quick -- but without it, hierarchical menus would be
far more annoying."

I think it would be counterintuitive if the currently pointed item would
_not_ be selected. (Unless this is explicitely asked, FVWM has such
feature as posting/unposting a submenu by a single click on it.)

All browsers I have (that use GTK and QT) behave exactly like the default
FVWM menus in that they select the currently pointed submenu item even if
another menu is currently popped up (hysteresis in your terms).

If you think any other system is working differently, explain how exactly.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I can reproduce the problem after some experiments.

The problem is in these lines:

  Style emacs StartsOnPage 1 1
  Style opera StartsOnPage 1 0

This only happens with 2.5.x, 2.4.x has no such binding problem.

If from a Form, I create a button which has commands:

	*FvwmForm-Tasks: Command *FvwmPagerSubPanel: Label 0 newLabel

The label in the pager is not updated until:

	*FvwmForm-Tasks: Command KillModule FvwmPager FvwmPagerSubPanel

is invoked, and then the Pager is restarted.

Is there a less intrusive way to get the Pager to update the labels?

I am running fvwm 2.4.11

I just read the "Window Manager placement" subsection of the Style
command section in the man page, and I can't see a way to tell FVWM to
always place new windows in the center of the screen.

Is there any way to configure FVMW to do that?

I'm trying to compile fvwm 2.4.13 w/ xinerama support but
configure is unable to find libxinerama.  I have xinerama
enabled and I am using it.

Anyone know where the default location for the xinerama libs
for sun are located?  I can find them in /usr/openwin/lib.

The error I get is:

ld: fatal: library -lXinerama not found.

Regards

Due to xinerama implementation differences between XFree86 and XSun,
Fvwm xinerama support only works with XFree86.

You might be able to install XFree86 on your Sun machine,
or maybe you'd be interested in creating patches to get Fvwm
support for Xinerama on Solaris working.

  I recently switched back to fvwm after moving to RedHat 8.0 and not
being satisfied with the changes to sawfish.   I've pretty much got
everything the way I want, except that under sawfish I was able to make
windows sticky in a desktop sense as well as in a viewport sense.  Is
there anything like this under fvwm or could it be added?

  Basically what I want to be able to do is have two desktops with 9
viewports (3x3) each and in the center viewport on each desk (not each
viewport) I want my web browser to stick to each desktop.

try something like this:

DestroyFunc MyGotoDesk
AddToFunc MyGotoDesk
	  + "I" All [mozilla] MoveToDesk $0
	  + "I" GotoDesk $0

(sub mozilla with whatever browser you use)

I'm guessing this would work, but watch the people who really know
tell me otherwise.

Actually, I do have that text.  

When you said "all sorts" I thought you meant there were all sorts of
things that could be controlled (separate).

I was referring more to the EWMH stuff which mostly applies to GNOME 2 and 
KDE. GNOME 1 only really has one option, unless you use FvwmGtk to draw 
your menus :-)

hey,

I'm trying to write a Perl module... and am getting tripped up trying
to figure out what the new page is upon a M_NEW_PAGE.

My problem is that M_NEW_PAGE->_vp_width/height only give me the
maximum width/height for the top left corner... but I need the top
right to figure out what page was just switched to, don't I (I can't
assume the screen res)? The only thing I can think of to fix this is
to have DeskTopSize inputted as a config option.

I tried using the module-flash @:
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/tests/perl/module-flash

But it has the same problem I'm having, it doesn't report the correct
page (as it claims it will).

I want to implement a Session Manager for a program with a lot of windows,
so that all windows are on the same pages, when i have shutdown fvwm2 and
restarted it.
So is there any possibility to get the Number of the page from within a
C-program for some WindowWidget.
By the way I'am using Xt and Motif.

  This doesn't work for me as far as I can tell.  Maybe I'm using it
wrong.  Would I put the MyGotoDesk keyword as a Style option for a
matched window then?

Fvwm implements page numbers by putting windows of high x/y
coordinates.  For example, if you have a 1024x768 destop and you
view page 0 0, a window on page 1 1 has x = x_on_that_page + 1024
and y = y_on_that_page + 768.  In other words:  you don't even
have to think about page numbers in a session manager, you get
that for free.

Fvwm implements page numbers by putting windows of high x/y
coordinates.  For example, if you have a 1024x768 destop and you
view page 0 0, a window on page 1 1 has x = x_on_that_page + 1024
and y = y_on_that_page + 768.  In other words:  you don't even
have to think about page numbers in a session manager, you get
that for free.

No, you have to replace GotoDesk and Desk with MyGotoDesk
everywhere.

Then I don't understand what you are trying to do.  There is a
well defined X interface for session managers to find out the
window positions.  What you say does not sound like you are using
it.  I don't know myself how it works.  Maybe someone else can
give a short introduction into the SMlib interface.

  Ahh, thanks.  That works.  The problem with this method though is that
if you decide to click on the pager to get to another desktop, your
window is still going to be on the other desk.  Any chance of getting a
StickyDesk style option added to fvwm?

The areas you are clicking on are not part of Fvwm.
Fvwm will not cause a segmentation violation in your application.
Fvwm does not interfere with clicks made in your application.

It sounds like you have a problem in your Motif application.
You should look for the core file, and use a debugger to find
out what the problem is.

I can't figure out from the above where you are clicking.

I can't figure out which button you are using either.
In the subject line it says "left mouse" and above it says
"right clicked".

Since you can't seem to find where the mouse binding is,
perhaps you should just override it.

The border fvwm puts around a window has 2 separate parts,
the frame which is the corners, and the sides.

To create a mouse binding for the corners, add this to the end of your
.fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1 F C Menu Move-or-raise

To create a mouse binding for the top/bottom and sides of the border
use this:

Mouse 1 S C Menu Move-or-raise

Replace "Menu Move-or-raise" with what you want Fvwm to do.

To just remove the binding, do this:

Mouse 1 S C -

Dear Mr. Dan,

Thanks or your help.

I will put the issue in Clear picture.

I have create a Main Widget class and over it I have created a Main Form. 
Now I have set the Main form as a Work_Region on the Main Widget class. I am 
creating a small bush button and a Label message over this Main Form.

I am holding the Control Key and clicking my Left mouse button on the Bush 
Button (The Area covered by the Button widget ) or Even on the Area covered 
by the Label Widget, Nothing is happening.

But if I clicked on the Main Form (Free area, not covered by any of the 
widget), the motif application is giving me segmentation fault error.

I have tried the suggession given by you in the .fvwmrc file. Still I am 
facing the problem. Is it problem with the Motif application?.

I am using fvwm 2.4.3 version.

Can you Please help me?

Thanks in Advance.

With Regards,

One other possible approach is using FvwmEvent to execute commands 
whenever the desktop is switched--It'd be very tricky to implement what 
you want using FvwmEvent, though...  A StickyDesk options would probably 
be much cleaner.

  Ahh, thanks.  That works.  The problem with this method though is that

Peter

I'm not quite sure what you're asking for. Are you trying to
figure out if a particular window is on the current page?
That's just a matter of comparing the window's coordinates
to the screen position. I can send code for that if you need it.

The page is just defined by the x and y coords of its top left,
as given by vp_x and vp_y. So the top left page is +0+0. I have
screen res of 1600x1200 so if I move down a page I am on +0+1200.
Move right and I am now on +1600+1200.

The problem for a module that doesn't load any X libraries is
finding out the screen resolution. It would be great if fvwm
passed this in e.g. M_CONFIG_INFO (future enhancement, anyone?).

I solve it in the following clunky manner:

  my $screen;

  open(XWININFO, "xwininfo -root|") || die "can't run xwininfo";
  while ( <XWININFO> ) {
    $screen->{w} = $1 if /Width:\s*(\d+)/;
    $screen->{h} = $1 if /Height:\s*(\d+)/;
  }
  close(XWININFO);

I would love a better solution if anyone has one :-)

Hello,

I think I had a configuration where I could move xmms around
the screen by simply clicking in its window and moving it.
This is with an "Easy Move" option turned on.

However, now I cant seem to be able to do this, and I
suspect that I screwed up my Style options for xmms somehow.
Or something. Right now, as I have NoTitle, the only way for
me to move xmms is to use my Window-Ops::Move menu. Its
fine, just a little annoying ;)

Could someone who has this working share their xmms
style please?

I am running 2.5.x + xmms 1.2.7
My style is as follows:

   Style xmms          UseUSPosition, UsePPosition
   Style xmms          BorderWidth 0, Handles, HandleWidth 1, NoTitle

thanks.

denis

Hmm,  I see an  "easy move"  option associated  with control-e,  but I
don't seem to  get anything out of selecting  it.  Why don't you solve
this for all windows?  Here, try some of my bindings:

# Button 2 with Meta, moves window:
Mouse 2         W       M       Move
# F7 with Meta moves window:
Key F7		A	M	Move

Thanks for the suggestion.  I installed Fvwm 2.5.4 and added this to
my .fvwmrc:
 
>   EwmhBaseStrut 0 576 0 432
>   style * EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea
>   style * placementoverlappenalties 1 5 10 1 0.05 1000, minoverlapplacement

It doesn't have any effect.  I'm trying to keep all windows in the
upper left 1024x768 region of the screen.  However when an app pops up
a dialog box (e.g. the search box in Galeon), the dialog comes up in
the empty area at location 1144x108, which is off the right of my
physical screen.

How is this supposed to work?

Hi

I just downloaded the latest fvwm snapshot and tried to run
some of the example perl modules in the tests directory from 
the cvs tree. To try the module I typed for instance 

/usr/local/src/fvwmperl/modulename

from the fvwm console. Unfortunately, nothing happens when 
I do this, not for any of the modules. How can I find out what
I am doing wrong?

While this does not solve my problem, this is a great
suggestion. I can get used to this quickly :-)

I think you want in your program to force some placement of your
application windows. I don't think this is what users (at least some of
them) want.

You may make your program session management aware by using libSM.
Then hopefully the last used place will be used for your windows by a
compliant window manager when run under a session manager.

Or you may just let the user to decide where windows of your application
will be placed by not doing anything special. Then a user (if he wants)
may just define:

  Style YourApp StartsOnPage 1 2
  Style YourApp CascadePlacement

Mikhael.

Interesting, what does it report if not the correct page numbers?
It works for me with 2.5.4.

I should be missing something, please enlighten me.
Is not it exactly what vp_width and vp_height arguments of M_NEW_PAGE are?
And M_NEW_DESK/M_NEW_PAGE are sent on Send_WindowList from modules.

This works for me:

Well, mine is as follows:

Style XMMS* Sticky, NoTitle, StaysOnTop, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, Icon,
GNOMEIgnoreHints

However, I found that I'm unable to move the xmms window if I check "Do
not hide windowmanager decorations. You might check to make sure that
this is unchecked. It's on the bottom left side under Preferences |
Options.

I am not sure how this may happen.

Do you have a correct fvwm-perllib in $PATH? Run: fvwm-perllib --version

Does FvwmDebug and FvwmGtkDebug work for you?

If you run the test modules from the shell command line do you enter the
dumb module mode without errors? Press Ctrl-C.

Mikhael.

Ah, yes! that's what it was, thanks. I still like Dan's
suggestion about moving all windows in a similar manner, but
this is exactly what I was looking for. 

thanks again.

There is no such placement policy currently.

A good solution would be FvwmPlacement module for all the fancy placement
policies like CenterPlacement, ConstantPlacement, UnderCursorPlacement.
But unfortunately a smooth effect is not possible without a change to the
module interface. Currently fvwm places a window itself and only then a
module may change its position.

> Is there any way to configure FVMW to do that?

See FAQ #3.18 and #7.14 to get an idea how to do this for some or all
windows. I hope you may combine these two into one solution yourself.

Regards,
Mikhael.

   isn't this function of xmms, independent of window manager?

   btw I found the fourth mouse button to be perfect for this - I 
configure it to move windows or resize windows with windows key pressed...

Hi there.

I recently built a new version of FVWM, updated yesterday from CVS
(FVWM 2.5.5 from CVS).

I have the following in my .fvwm2rc:

<snip>
	DestroyFunc	MoveOrRaise
	AddToFunc	MoveOrRaise
		+ I Raise
		+ M Move
		+ D WindowShade

	# Alt+Click should raise, Alt+Drag should raise and move:
	Mouse	1	FWST	M	MoveOrRaise
</snip>

It used to be so that with those lines, when clicking on a window with
the left mouse button and the Meta key pressed, the window would
raise, not getting the mouse event, and when dragging a window with
the left mouse button and the Meta key pressed, the window would raise
and move, not getting the mouse event.

Now, since the upgrade of FVWM, this does not work so anymore, if the
window is not already raised.

Now if the window is not already raised, when clicking on a window
with the left mouse button and the Meta key pressed, the window
raises, but gets the mouse event as well (for example, XTerm beeps).

When dragging a window with the left mouse button and the Meta key
pressed, if the window is not already raised, it is raised, but not
moved, and gets the event.  If the window is already raised, it moves
and does not get the event.

I noticed that when removing the following line from my .fvwm2rc, this
behaviour is fixed:

<snip>
	# Click to raise:
	Style	*	MouseFocusClickRaises
</snip>

But I do want windows which are clicked on to raise, in addition to
getting the event, if the Meta key is not pressed when clicking on
them.


I checked in the ChangeLog, and saw one thing regarding
MouseFocusClickRaises.
I also checked in the fvwm(1) manual page, and I see that many new
style directives for focus policies were added.  Maybe the semantics
for old styles have changed a bit as well, but I couldn't figure out
what it is exactly.

I tried playing somewhat with the new FP... styles, but did not manage
to get the previous behaviour.

The FPClickRaisesFocused style did not seem to work for me - the
windows were not raised when clicked on.

I also have the SloppyFocus style on all windows.

Any idea why the old behaviour does not work anymore, or how I can get
it again?

  Thanks, any help appreciated,

HI

The perllib version gives:

linux:~ # fvwm-perllib --version
2.5.5

When I run from the fvwmconsole: 

FvwmDebug -l logfile

then in the logfile I see entries like M_FOCUS_CHANGE etc.
When I then try to run the module, nothing happens and no 
extra entries apppear. I noticed one strange thing: I tried
to run a non-existing module to see if an error message 
appears when the module is not found, but this does not 
happen. I.e. when I enter in the fvwmconsole

module /home/jos/nonexistingmodule

then no error message appears on the console. On the other
hand, when I type

module nonexistingmodule

then an errormessage does appear, saying that the module is not
found in the module path. 

Now I just tried to run the module from the commandline. Then 
I see this:

linux:/usr/local/src/fvwmperl # perl module-gtkwinlist 
FvwmPerlGtkWinList should be spawned by fvwm normally.
Activating a dummy command line mode for 30 minutes (no events).
----------------------------------------------------------------

and a gtk window appears, but the buttons are not functional and 
no windows appear in the windowlist.

I hope this helps,

jos

I am not sure how this may happen.

Do you have a correct fvwm-perllib in $PATH? Run: fvwm-perllib --version

Does FvwmDebug and FvwmGtkDebug work for you?

If you run the test modules from the shell command line do you enter the
dumb module mode without errors? Press Ctrl-C.

Do you have by a chance this line:

  Style * FixedPPosition

Without letting xmms to fiddle with program specified possition it
can't move itself.

So you only see what happens in FvwmConsole (can I ask you to name
FvwmConsole as FvwmConsole and not console?).

The error "execution of module /home/jos/nonexistingmodule failed"
appears in the same place you have all X output (including FvwmDebug).

Not quite. If it works from the command line, the problem should be
in the communication code, but if you say FvwmDebug works, I don't know.
Is it possible that only GTK based modules do not work?

Please continue to debug the problem and find where your errors are.

Mikhael.

 Sorry I meant that when I try to run a non-existing
module with full path specified from the FvwmConsole, 
then no error message appears on the FvwmConsole eg:

module /home/jos/nonexistingmodule.

When I try

module nonexistingmodule

then an errormessage saying that the module is not found
in the path appears on the FvwmConsole. 

Both types of modules don't work (gtk and non-gtk)...

I'll try and look further..

Hi,
I recently upgraded to the latest X 4.2.99
and built fvwm from the cvs. when i started fvwm, i got these messages
for every application that i opened

X does not support locale en_US.iso885915

and locale not supported by Xlib, locale set to C.

can anyone tell me how I can get rid of these messages?

thank you
Rahul

HI

I checked the x output using 

fvwm2 > err

and it turned out that the problem was that the module files
were not 'chmod +x':

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed:
/usr/local/src/fvwmperl/module-gtkwinlist
Permission denied

Sorry for that.

Since it's not clear what you want to align with what, I can not
give a precise answer.  Check the FvwmButtons man page and look for
the term "align".

What is the way to find out what version of fvwm I am
using in the session?
I installed 2.5.4 to see if it solved a windowing prob
I am having, but I am not 100% sure that I am actually
in that version...
"New features" does not seem up-to-date.
FvwmBanner only pops us "Fvwm".
The use of the -version command line option causes
problems with my dist. (Debian)
Thanks.

When I rewrote the focus related options I could not avoid
changing the default behaviour in some situations.

It does not work anymore because I took the opportunity to clean
up the "click to raise" handling.  While some focus policies
worked with any modifier held down when clicking to raise, others
required that no modifier was held.  I thought it would be good to
ignore the modifier by default.  You can get the old behaviour
with

  Style * FPFocusClickModifiers N

or

  FocusStyle * FocusClickModifiers N

I am unsure if I should try to fix the defaults for MouseFocus and
Sloppy Focus.

Try adding

It is supposed to work well ;-)  Seriously, when fvwm places
windows in minoverlapplacement mode, it tried to keep the
overlapped area of other windows as small as possible.  The
placement penalties determine a weight for each window (see the
man page for details).  The EwmhBaseStrut command defines so
called "struts" (yes, I know the name is braindead; we did not
invent it).  These are borders at the four sides of the screen in
which no windows are placed under KDE or Gnome.  The last number
of the ...penalties line is the penalty for placing windows in
these areas.

Not in 2.4.11, but with 2.5.x you can use the "DesktopName"
command.  Just issue

  DesktopName 0 newLabel

However, I will change the name of the command to "DeskName" or
"DeskLabel" shortly, so be prepared to edit your configuration
when that happens.

It's weird that -version causes problems, it shouldn't. But since
you're running debian:

$ dpkg -l fvwm*
(make sure there isn't any filename in your pwd which matches that
though).

Make sure that you don't have any fvwm packages installed.

It sounds like you may have 2 versions installed. This would be
possible if you installed the debian version and a home-compiled
version.

Start the FvwmConsole module.  It prints out the version number
from which it came.  If you suspect that the module may be from a
different fvwm version, type

  echo $v

to the FvwmConsole window.  That prints the version string of the
running fvwm binary to the X server console.

Well, I've got a 3x3 desk. So:
{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} :: module-flash shows: (0,0)
{(2,0), (2,1)} :: module-flash shows: (1,0)
{(0,2), (1,2)} :: module-flash shows: (0,1)
{(2,2)} :: module-flash shows: (1,1)

examining the formula in module-flash:
    my $page_nx = int($event->_vp_x / $width);
    my $page_ny = int($event->_vp_y / $height);

the highest values that page_nx/ny can possibly be is 1. They will
never be higher.

I don't completely follow what you're saying here. M_NEW_DESK/PAGE are
sent TO modules, are they not? And M_NEW_PAGE's vp_width/height show
(from the online docs): 
The fourth [vp_width] and fifth [vp_height] values are the maximum
allowed values of the coordinates of the upper-left hand corner of the
viewport.

Seeing as how it is possible (using FvwmPager) to be "in-between" two
pages, I can see how the values passed with an M_NEW_PAGE signal are
useful. Is there any way to get fvwm to send me the page size, though?
or is this considered an X issue?

thanks,
-peter =)

no, I dont have the line. it All had to do with this
"Do not hide windowmanager decorations" option being
checked, as suggested by Andrew. I have no idea what it
really does, or how it does it, but after I changed the
value of this option, things started working. Although, by
this time I've been moving windows around the screen using
alt-mouse2, but for xmms this is still a welcome solution :-)

thanks for the suggestion though.

I dont know, but Mikhael's mail seems to suggest that its
not entirely true, as FixedPPosition could disable this as
well.. I haven't tried it..

Ok, I see it now. This example only works well with the 2x2 desktop.

It is pretty silly that the page size is not send. I thought the 4-th and
5-th arguments of M_NEW_PAGE are the page size, now I should rename them.

Anyway, it is still possible currently to calculate the page size
using these 2 silly values (the maximal left-upper coordinate possible
in the pager) and "DesktopSize 3 3" (this is the first M_CONFIG_INFO
packet sent on Send_ConfigInfo). I will think what to do about M_NEW_PAGE.

Mikhael.

Did you change the focus code that might fix 2.5.4's mishandling of xview
(eg textedit) windows? 

ie: Upon restart or some other fvwm activities (such as menus), xview
windows no longer accept (take) focus. It requires opening the window's menu
but not selecting anything from it for xview windows to take focus again.
Mailtool works fine tho somehow.

Lenience fixes this, but then the 1st click in the window isnt passed to the
window.

2.5.3 works fine.
clicktofocus mode

Thanx

Aha....only works on 2.5.3 cuz i changed focus.c in it.
Similarly changing 2.5.4 also fixes it.

I have a situation when I cannot use the mouse. With fvwm95 (rc
file originally from debian bo or hamm IIRC), the monkey test
brought out Ctrl-Shift-Arrow within a matter of seconds, but
click still escapes me. I'd have expected Ctrl-Shift-Enter,
or Ctrl-Shift-1.

Finding 

# press shift arrow + control anywhere, and move the pointer by 1% of a page
Key Left        A       SC      CursorMove -1 0

etc. was simple, but no amount of replacing a command with
"Mouse 1", "Click", "LeftClick", "Click 1", "Click1" helped, and
I didn't find any other likely candidates. Google didn't help,
neither did the fvwm FAQ, and I couldn't find anything to search
the list archives (thay don't seem to be found in Google).

So my questions are: is there a binding I'm likely to have that
I've missed; if so, what is it and where should I have looked
for it; if not, how do I make one?

TIA

This is not the fvwm95 list.
Fvwm95 was last changed many years ago, I think you might be
happier with something more current.
Fvwm can easily do everything fvwm95 does.
To start, install a current version of fvwm.
If you have a .fvwm/.fvwm2rc file, remove it.
Then click on the root and ask it to run the Setup 95 Script.
Then restart.

I think what you are looking for is the ability to simulate
mouse clicks with the keyboard.  If so, check out question
3.5 in the FAQ.

Exactly. I found (find) it amazing that one should be able to
move the mouse pointer, but not simulate a click. Now that I
think about it, the wm has a valid reason to move the pointer

Ah, sorry again, missed that one (searched on "click"). Will
look into migrating (to XKB, fvwm2...) :-(

Thanks for the answer on how to determine the vesrion.
It's 2.5.4 alright.
I compiled that with Freetype and it comfirmed it. But
how can you actually notice the difference with a
non-Xft enabled version?
thanks.

Hi,

I tried to compile fvwm (version 2.4.13) on my Mac
(Mac OS X 10.2.1, Compiler is gcc 3.1) and I got an
error ...

Here is the output :
menus.c:240: illegal expression, found 'void'
fvwm.h:120: parse error in conditional expression

It seems to me that the preprozessor doesn't like 
#if RETSIGTYPE != void

What can I do to compile fvwm ?
(And please, don't tell me that I should update my compile, I can't do it
...
And yes, I know that fvwm runs on Mac, since several poeple use an older
version. They didn`t compile it, they got a precompiled package ...)

Thanks for reading ...

Mikhael,

Based on your advice, I was able to make new FVWM-placed windows appear
in a consistent location (though not exactly centered on the screen)
with this code in my .fvwm2rc file:

	DestroyFunc MyCenterWindow
	AddToFunc MyCenterWindow
	+ I WindowId $0 (PlacedByFvwm) Move 25 25

	*FvwmEvent: StartDelay 5
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd
	*FvwmEvent: PassID
	*FvwmEvent: add_window "Function MyCenterWindow"

Thanks!

Excellent!  This seems to do the trick.

Now, another question... Can I cause these commands to be loaded into
a running fvwm, from the command line?  I have a shell script that runs
every time I undock the laptop, and I'd like that script to tell fvwm to
reconfigure itself appropriately.

Thanks,

Yes, no problem.  Start the FvwmCommandS module in your config file:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmCommandS

This enables a shell interface to fvwm.  On the command line, type

  $ FvwmCommand "Style * NoPPosition, NoTransientPPosition"

(the command has to be put in double quotes).  Of course you can
type them into the FvwmConsole module window or put them into a
menu too.  For example:

  AddToMenu some_menu
  + dock Function dock_machine
  + undock Function un_dock_machine

  AddToFunc dock_machine
  + I Style * NoPPosition, NoTransientPPosition
  + I EwmhBaseStruts 0 rrr 0 bbb
  ...

  AddToFunc undock_machine
  + I Style * UsePPosition, UseTransientPPosition
  + I EwmhBaseStruts 0 0 0 0
  ...

(note that I renamed EWMHBaseStrut to EwmhBaseStruts in the latest
development code.  The old name is no longer supported.)

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi all,

I just compiled fvwm 2.4.13 and I have a little question: when I start X, the mouse pointer looks like a clock, like if it was waiting for the ending of something (but what?!?), and I do not see the usual arrow.
Is there a reason for this? I add that this only happens since I upgraded to mandrake 9.0.

Thanks

Evariste

A while back, Fvwm was changed to indicate it is busy by displaying a watch
cursor.  As soon as its ready to manage windows and the like,
the watch should change to the usual X cursor.

You can get more information by searching for BusyCursor in the man page.

fvwm-2.5.4

How does one specify a sound directory for FvwmEvent without invoking
FvwmAudio compatibility mode (I'm using esd/esdplay instead of rplay).
If I missed this in the documentation, all apologies in advance.

Thanks much.

There is no way to specify a sound directory in the plain FvwmEvent.
But there are 2 approaches how not to duplicate it every time:

  *FvwmEvent-Sound: Cmd "Exec exec esdplay"
  SetEnv SOUND_DIR /data/multimedia/sounds
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: add_window       $[SOUND_DIR]/add_window.au
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: destroy_window   $[SOUND_DIR]/destroy_window.au
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: iconify          $[SOUND_DIR]/iconify.au
  ...

If you don't want to hardcode any directory, use "relative" directory:

  *FvwmEvent-Sound: add_window       $./../sounds/add_window.au
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: destroy_window   $./../sounds/destroy_window.au
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: iconify          $./../sounds/iconify.au
  ...

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't know, probably until 3.0.0.

It should be fairly trivial to change FvwmEvent to accept format specifier
(like %s) in Cmd. If it is not found in Cmd, then " %s" is added to it
just like it works now. Then something like this would work for you:

  *FvwmEvent-Sound: Cmd "Exec exec esdplay /data/multimedia/sounds/%s.wav"
  *FvwmEvent-Sound: add_window wiggle

I don't have a time to add this right now. Maybe someone else has.

You can't.  All you can do is write a shell script that has the
path hard coded.

In FvwmTaskBar, does it decode double clicks on buttons?  The manual 
says "supported actions are: Click1, Click2, Click3 and so  on," but I'm 
not sure what the "so on" is.  Are there other actions besides the three 
single clicks?

I'm trying to do this:

*FvwmTaskBar:  Action Double1 Iconify

Thanks!

Hi,

I use FvwmIconBox. With 2.2.x everything is o.k.,
with 2.4.3 also,

but at least since 2.4.8 and still with 2.4.13
the scrollbars are not redrawn if an other windows covers it.

I have made no changes at the configuration, only installed a new fvwm2=20
version! I use XFree86 Version 4.1.

Whats wrong?

Regards
Harald

Is it possible, in 2.2.4 (Red Hat 6.2), to bind a titlebar button
to only some windows?  The impression I get from the manpage is
that the Mouse command applies to all windows.

Specifically, I'd like to define a button 0 action on "xpdf" windows,
without causing button 0 to appear on all the other windows.

You can use the Styles "Button, NoButton"

Like this:

Mouse 0 ...
Mouse 1 ...
<and so on...>

# no window get button 0 
Style * NoButton 0
# turn on button 0 for only xpdf
Style xpdf Button 0

Is there a way to get an FvwmButtons Panel to be "rolled out" initially 
so the user doesn't have to push the button to see the panel?

Thanks!

I have a pop-out panel that is showing up in my TaskBar in spite of my 
use of:

Style "Fvwm*"   NoTitle,  Sticky, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkipIcon, 
CirculateSkip

I've also tried:

Style "FvwmButtons" WindowListSkip
Style FvwmPanelA WindowListSkip
Style FvwmPanelB WindowListSkip

PanelA is the Panel button and it doesn't show up in the taskbar. 
 PanelB is the panel itself and it shows up.

Any ideas? (I'm on 2.4.9)

Kyle

Before switching to fvwm, I got used to kcalc in kde.  In kde kcalc has
buttons like non-transients (minimize, close).  In fvwm, however, kcalc
gets a title bar but no minimize button --- even with DecorateTransient
in my ~/.fvwm2rc.  I've noticed this same behavior with kcalc and xfce
(which is and/or was based on fvwm code).  Is there any way to force
kcalc to appear as non-transient to fvwm?

Thanks for any help.

Well, if upgrading is out of the question, how about downgrading?
Are you maybe running a broken cpp?  Is it definitely the one that
comes with gcc?

  Click4, Click5, ...

That depends on the number of Mouse buttons that are compiled into
fvwm.  Double clicks are not supported.

I know next to nothing about the way fvwm is built (I know
it works when I ./configure/make it :) ), but it seems that
RETSIGTYPE is defined in config.h. Is that file dynamically
generated?

I could see how if that file is not present (or is for some
reason wrong) and RETSIGTYPE is not defined, you'd get an
error message, since preprocessor would see something like 
   #if != void

This is because you have either MwmFunctions or MwmDecor in your config,
both disable a corresponding button if an application asks for this. Do:

  Style kcalc NoFuncHint, NoDecorHint

You may report to kcalc developers that marking kcalc transient and
setting mwm hints is unjustified and bad for a user. How is it in KDE 3?

You may play with complex functions that have "M", "C" and "D", then you
may get double and triple clicks... Hovewer you should understand that the
first click is handled by FvwmTaksBar and the following ones are by fvwm.

It isn't transient, it requests that it does not want to be
minimized.  Try

  Style * NoFuncHint

Thats a good idea, and I have found the problem,

its the line:

Style  "*"  BackingStore

In general I don't need this Option because I use it in the X-Configurati=
on=20
(its necessary for some programs which I use [paw and root]). But for som=
e=20
graphics drivers its not enough and I need the option also in the .fvwm2r=
c=20
file.=20
I'm sure that it makes no differences for fvwm 2.2.4 w.r.t. FvwmIconBox, =
but I=20
can't say if the problem is not seen in 2.4.3 because I'm start using thi=
s=20
option a short while ago.

Any idea whats going on? Or a general solution?

Thanks
Harald

Does this line cause the problem or fix it?

I am aware that there are some problems with backing store, but we
were never able to pin them down (and I still can't reproduce your
problem).  We had numerous reports of window parts not getting
drawn, in various applications, but I could not pin down a single
one.  It seems that under certain circumstances *some* X servers
do not always generate an Expose event when necessary.  Thus,
applications do not redraw themselves when they should.  I am
still missing a way to see that myself and to find out what fvwm
might be doing to expose this bug (I think it's an X bug).

Did it and it works perfectly now.  Thanks very much.  I had tried some
related Style options, but must not have read the man page carefully
enough.

I haven't yet tried KDE 3, so I don't know.  After switching back to
fvwm, I'm hoping to avoid KDE 3 :-).

The only reason I prefer kcalc over xcalc is how kcalc's Backspace
erases the last-entered digit of a number, as opposed to xcalc's
clearing of all the digits.

Thanks again and take it easy.

Hi there:

What do I have to change in the ".fvwm2rc" file in my home directory  so
that when I place the mouse on a window it goes to the foreground and 
becomes the active one?

Thank you.

Hmm, I tried:

DestroyFunc Deiconify-Focus-Raise-or-Iconify
AddToFunc Deiconify-Focus-Raise-or-Iconify
+       I Iconify off
+       I Focus
+       I Raise
+      D Iconify on

*FvwmTaskBar:   Action Click1 Deiconify-Focus-Raise-or-Iconify

and fvwm locks up hard (except I still have cursor motion).  It appears 
that if I add any kind of context other than "I", fvwm locks up, even if 
the action is a Nop.

hey. I remember some change being made to the Next and Prev commands,
and every since then they've been annoying.

my alt-tab command:
Key Tab   A    M    Next [CurrentPage !iconic] FocusRaise

my whole .fvwm2rc file:
www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/pub/fvwm/my.fvwm2rc

Sometimes alt-tab works ok, and sometimes it leaves windows out of the
cycle. I've found that the cycle just stops at xclock and Gaim. There
are probably other that block the cycle, as well, but I haven't
noticed what they are yet.

thanks,
Peter

I'm unable to run fvwm under weirdx (WeirdX being a Pure Java
X Window System Server similar to Exceed or ReflectionX),

  http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx

I hadn't used weirdx for about 6 months and then went back
to using it, yet now fvwm (without any errors or stderr notes)
simply doesn't seem to start (it most certainly did in the
past on previous versions).  Other window managers (twm, olvwm)
don't have any problems under weirdx and work flawlessly.

Could someone please confirm that there are problems in
relation to fvwm and weirdx ?  Can anyone start fvwm under
weirdx ?

 Fvwm versions: 2.5.4 and snap-shots from late October
 gcc --version: 2.95.2
 uname -a     : SunOS pez 5.7 Generic_106541-19 sun4u

Thanks (please CC replies)

I have backing store support enabled (but only a window or two with that 
style forced), and since I've turned it on, I've noticed that the root 
window will not always be redrawn when switching from the console to 
X--I'm voting for the X bug theory.

(but I think the fvwm version is irrelevant)

This isn't new.  The xclock window does not want to be focused and
thus stops the cycle.  You can either force it to accept the
focus:

  Style xterm Lenience

Or skip windows that do not want to be focused:


That problem has been around for a long time
Yeah, but I believe it's not the change I made to "Next" but the
bug with the "Key" command that causes it to work like
"Pointerkey".  I have fixed this with my latest commit.  If the
problem still does not go away, please report back.

  Key Tab A M Next (CurrentPage, acceptsfocus, !iconic) FocusRaise

(Note that the syntax with conditions in brackets and separated
with spaces will probably be removed in 3.0).

Bye

Just look at the example I sent:

  Key Tab A M Next (CurrentPage, acceptsfocus, !iconic) FocusRaise

Enclose them in parentheses and use commas to separate them.

Hi,

I'm trying to build fvwm-2.5.4 on a Solaris box, and am running into
problems making files
for png support.  I have untar'ed and uncompressed the fvwm files into a
directory, with the xpm
and png libraries one directory up.  Configure seems to run without a
hitch.


./configure --prefix=/lsi/home/bsferraz/bin/fvwm-2.5.4
--with-xpm-library=../xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib
--with-xpm-includes=../xpm-3.4k-solaris/include
--with-png-library=../libpng-1.2.5/lib
--with-png-includes=../libpng-1.2.5/include


But when I do 'make' after the configure, I get the following error:

I've tried changing the LDFLAGS variable as suggested in the
INSTALL.fvwm file, but this doesn't seem to help.

Any suggestions are much appreciated.

Thanks,
Ben

thanks, I missed that...

I updated/built/installed my cvs source, but the problem still
exists. I've figured out when/what happens:
1) open up 2 or more windows (I do it with emacs and rxvt, but I don't
think it matters)
2) have the two windows overlap in some parts of the screen, and not
overlap in other parts

and here's the behavior:
**** have the pointer in an area that they ALL overlap or an area that
     NONE of them occupy == cycle no problem

**** have the pointer in an area that only one of them occupy == raise
     next but then stop cycling, and it will never raise the window
     that the pointer is over

ok... now I've really got it figured out... try the above 2 as
examples... but here's the rule it seems to be following:

cycle until a window is selected that does not have the pointer on
it
***AND***
if the pointer isn't on any window, then cycle no problem.

I'm using the ClickToFocus style. my whole .fvwm2rc file is @:
http://www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/pub/fvwm/my.fvwm2rc

Peter

Should be better now.

fvwm-2.5.4

I've noticed when I put something like `Exec exec xterm' in my .fvwm2rc
file, I lose colorization of file types (`set' shows LS_COLORS to have
no value.  If I use just `Exec xterm' all the colors are there (`set'
shows LS_COLORS with all its regular values) but then I wonder about
what's in the fvwm man page:

``Without that [the added `exec'], the shell that fvwm invokes to run your
command stays until the command exits.  In effect, you'll have twice as
many processes	running as you need.  Note that some shells are smart
enough to avoid this, but it never hurts to include the "exec" anyway.''

The shell I use is /bin/bash.  That shows up when I type `env' and I set
it explicitly with the ExecUseShell command near the top of my .fvwm2rc.

When I do a `ps -ax' both with and without the `exec', I see two
processes:  one for xterm and one for /bin/bash (Does this also explain
why iconifying one xterm window sometimes causes FvwmEvent to play two
quasi-synchonous sounds?).  According to the man page, should there not
be only one process when using `Exec exec xterm' or is my bash
configuration possibly broken in some way?

Thanks for any help regarding this.

I would guess that when you do Exec xterm, the environment you started X 
with is being inherited, and when you do Exec exec xterm, the 
environment is being cleared.  Try putting xterm*loginShell: true in 
your ~/.Xresources (or ~/.Xdefaults if appropriate), or starting xterm 
like: Exec exec xterm -xrm 'loginShell: true'

None of those worked; I'm not sure yet why.  What I did was this:

Exec exec xterm -ls

and this seems to be working now.  Thanks for pointing me in the right
direction.  I suppose this may not have technically been an fvwm issue;
I'll try to dig a little deeper next time before I post.

The man page exaggerates a bit.  Without "exec", the xterm is
started as a separate process, whereas with "exec" it replaces the
*parent* shell:

  Without exec:

    bash
      xterm
        bash (client app)

  With exec:

    xterm (replaces original bash)
      bash (client app)

I added an entry to the menu so that I have ``XTerm'' and ``Other
Xterm,'' with the former using `Exec xterm' and the latter using `Exec
exec xterm.'  When I open ``Xterm'' and ``Other XTerm'' from the menu
and then do a ``ps -ax'' I get one xterm and one bash entry for both.  I
also noticed that my xterm is really a shell script calling xterm.real
(the real binary), so I changed both menu entries to call xterm.real
directly --- with the same results as above.  My ps output shows
something like this:

29836 ?        S      0:00 xterm.real -sb <more options> 
29837 pts/1    S      0:00 bash

Since bash is listed after xterm.real, does this mean that bash is
xterm's client (as in your second scenario above)?  If so, why do using
both ``Exec exec xterm'' and ``Exec xterm'' seem to produce the same
results.  I'm not trying to belabor the point; I just want to be sure I
don't have unnecessary processes going on.  Thanks very much.

With bash, both "Exec xterm" and "Exec exec xterm" are equivalent, since
it is "smart" not to fork in this case. Also try "ps xf" or "ps auxf".

Hi there,

thanks for your help ...

I made it simple, I played preprocessor ...
I looked in config.h, found that RETSIGTYPE was defined as void and replaced
the corresponding lines in fvwm/fvwm.h.
Now the line looks like "#define SIGNAL_RETURN return"

After that little change, I can run make ...

... but I get another error :

Compiling of FvwmBacker stops with an error about undefined symbols :

gcc  -g -O2  -o FvwmBacker  FvwmBacker.o root_bits.o -L../../libs
-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lfvwm -lXpm         -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11 -lm
ld: Undefined symbols:
_Pcmap
_Pdepth
_Pdpy
_Pvisual
make[3]: *** [FvwmBacker] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

What can I do here ?

(My goal is to write a little howto for compiling Fvwm 2.4.13 on Mac Os X
version 10.2.2 ...)

In this case, probably yes.  Try "pstree -p" to see which process
was spawned by whom.

Good question.  I can only guess that modern shells use "exec"
automatically when started with "<shell> -c <cmd>".

Really, I think all you can do is to switch to a working compiler
and report the bugs to the gcc crew.

I know two things :
1) The actual version of gcc is 3.2
2) The version 3.1 for Mac Os X 10.2.2 is part of the devlopper tools ...

I don't know if it is possible to simpy upgrade gcc to 3.2 ...

And reporting Bugs ... not really a solution. Here's the result of gcc -v

Reading specs from /usr/libexec/gcc/darwin/ppc/3.1/specs

gcc-3.2 wouldn't help either.  We already have several reports of
compiler bugs that prevent 3.2 from compiling fvwm properly.
Isn't 2.95.x available for the Mac too?

GCC 2.95.x is part of the older devlopper tools ... of course, they on run
on Mac OS X 10.1.x ...
As said bevore, GCC 3.1 is the only processor available for me ...

Well, if the only available cpp is broken, you basically have no
working gcc at all, right?  I can't think of anything else but to
live with it or let someone else compile it with a working
compiler.

I just want to clarify that 2 reports we have about gcc-3.x are Mac
related. On other platforms any recent gcc version (2.96 or 3.2) may be
used to build fvwm. At least this is what I use for the last 2 years.

Mikhael.

Why broken ? I compiled mysql without problems ...
blackbox and some other tools are just fine ...

But I want fvwm as windowmanager for XDarwin (Xfree on Mac OS X)

Maybe broken is a bit too strong of a word... but it's definately
buggy. fvwm has bugs, but it's still useable the vast majority of the
time. Same with your compiler, useable most of the time, but not all
the time.

You reported that this wouldn't preprocess:

#if RETSIGTYPE != void

It looks valid to me.

Then you reported that you got this linker error:

gcc  -g -O2  -o FvwmBacker  FvwmBacker.o root_bits.o -L../../libs
-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lfvwm -lXpm         -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11 -lm
ld: Undefined symbols:
_Pcmap
_Pdepth
_Pdpy
_Pvisual

Those symbols should have been in libfvwm.a, located in
../../libs.  They are defined in libs/PictureBase.c.
(I'm not sure what adds the "_", but I think they are normal.)

Anyway, it just looks like your compiler isn't working.

We've had other users report successful Fvwm compiles on MacOS.

  Broken = unable to compile/preprocess perfectly legal code

How else would you call that?

I got it !!!
My fix for the preprocessor error :
   I did it myself (fvwm/fvwm.h: lines 120-124)
My fix for those undefined symbols :
   In modules/FvwmBacker I changed the Makefile :
all:
        echo "Removed !!!"
(Means : I don't have the FvwmBacker Module)

But with these changes, I can compile it ...

This is a suggestion from a delighted user, to make an excellent new
fvwm2  feature even better - when used by geriatrics whose shaky hands
cannot be trusted to draw a simple straight line with any degree of
consistency.

Would it be possible to call "stroke" (with Alt + Mouse 2?) from a
window that displays a 3x3 grid?  This would ensure that my wavery
diagonal lines and untrue right angles are close enough to the intended
"strokes".

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

Does (or did, back in 2.4.7) fvwm2 amend the user's $PATH with the output of
"fvwm-config -B" (or its equivalent)?  It's showing up in my $PATH (when
echoed in terminal windows launched by fvwm2) but there's nothing in my
configuration to explain it.  Terminal windows that are "cousins" of fvwm2
(different process lineage from a common ancestor) don't include fvwm2's
location in $PATH.

Thanks,
Gregg Dameron

I've been looking through the fvwm documentation and
have had difficulty finding this issue.  For example,
I would like fvwm to change the menus and environment
based on time of day and other input.. 

How would I implement this.. ??

fvwm does not change your $PATH, but fvwm-themes-start does it if needed.
This is done to verify that all programs installed with fvwm (fvwm-config,
fvwm-menu-directory, fvwm-root (was xpmroot) etc.) are available to you.
Generally it is always a good idea to have fvwm (fvwm2 prior to 2.4.8) in
your $PATH, but this is not required if you know what you do.

Mikhael.

fvwm-2.5.4

I have the following line in a configuration file

PipeRead 'for i in Menu/*.men; do echo read $i; done'

which produces the following error message in my ~/.xsession-errors:

[FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file 'Menu/*.men' not found in \
/home/norvell/.fvwm or /usr/share/fvwm

Yet there is a directory in my .fvwm directory named Menu in which are
files with men as the extension.  If I change the PipeRead command to:

PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/.fvwm/Menu/*.men; do echo read $i; done'

fvwm does what I need it to.  What's wrong with my first PipeRead?
Thanks for any answers.

The for i in part is relative to $HOME.
The fvwm read command reads in $HOME/.fvwm.

If you change the first part to .fvwm/Menu/*.man
it will screw up $i for the read.

I think you'll find full paths work better.

Another way to refer to "$HOME/.fvwm" is $FVWM_USERDIR.

Pardon my ignorance, but I still don't quite understand.  How is the
``for i in'' part relative to $HOME when the error message says:

[FVWM][Read]: <<ERROR>> file 'Menu/*.men' not found in \
/home/norvell/.fvwm or /usr/share/fvwm

Doesn't that suggest that fvwm starts looking in $HOME/.fvwm for i (but
doesn't see it), then in /usr/share/fvwm, before looking in $HOME?

> I think you'll find full paths work better.

That's what I'll end up doing.  I'll eventually change the script
commands to look in /usr/share/fvwm, then in $FVWM_USERDIR.  I'm working
on a klugey approach to menu configuration:  one file per app, each
file containing both menu entry and style commands.  Thanks for your
help and for responding so quickly.

You still see the "*" in the file name because the shell didn't
expand Menu/*.man since no file matched.

Go to $HOME/.fvwm and type in:

ls 'Menu/*.man'

I hope I'm explaining this right, its getting late.

Sound right to me. Assuming the code is actually running where he hopes
(i.e. $HOME is fine), the above line  might be modified thus:


	PipeRead 'for i in Menu/*.men; do [ -f $i ] && echo read $i; done'

or just thus:

	PipeRead 'ls -d Menu/*.men 2>/dev/null | sed "s/^/read /"'

Your call as to which is easier to read :-)

The usual approach is to generate the menus on the fly with PipeRead,
and put the smarts in the shell (or perl or ...) script that emits the
menu contents.

The FVWM config file doesn't really have a conditional syntqax - the closest
it comes is the flags for window selection (CurrentDesk, etc).

Hello everybody, 

I use Fvwm2 for a few days now. Im quite impressed nad love the pager
and the taskbar :). Only the configuration held me back from using it.

I have configured the styles, colors, key- and mousebindings etc. but
there is still one thing disturbing me. Everytime i change a 
desktop/page with my keyboard (or mouse but prefer to use the 
keyboard), the window(s) there dont get the focus.

Is it possible (perhaps with AddFunc) that Fvwm2 changes to a
desktop/page, remembers the last focused window and focus and raise it?
That would be great because i have the problem that i switch to a
desktop, type with my keyboard and recognize then that the window i want
to type in, is not focused :)=)

Any help would be great.

Thanks in advance, 

-JASON

P.S. I tried a little bit with focus-and-raise after switching but it
does not worl like i imagined.

What you want is scheduling events, not conditional statements.

You may add this command to your .fvwm2rc:

  AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmCommandS

Then setup crontab to run FvwmCommand with any commands at any day time
you want. This is mostly a unix problem, not FVWM's. Although developement
versions do have a new command Schedule that may or may not help you.
It is more intended for short delays (several seconds), not several hours.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,
I want to change the width of the four elemants of the windowborder
individually.
My goal is to have only the titlebar and one bar at the bottom of the
window like in wmaker, blackbox or fluxbox.
Is that possible?

I use fvwm 2.5.4

Klaus

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

We are trying to run Sun's RAID Manager GUI, rm6.  When it runs, it displays
a box of icons that lets the user launch child GUI processes (similar to the
CDE App Manager).  FvwmIdent shows all the rm6 GUIs to be class
"OpenInterface", resource "openedit".

Some of the child process GUIs have a Toolbar.  When you roam the mouse over
one of the toolbar buttons, a popup tooltip is supposed to appear.  What
happens is, you get the tooltip for a few milliseconds, then the child GUI's
process exits normally (status 0), as if it had received a close request
from the window manager.  Truss reveals no obvious "smoking gun".

I tried using the default (built-in) fvwm2 configuration and got the same
result.

I went back to my regular configuration and tried using the keyboard mapping
to move the mouse (Alt + arrow keys).  I can move the mouse over the toolbar
buttons, and the process stays up, but then, the tooltip never appears.

The rm6 GUIs work fine under olwm, dtwm and twm.  Any suggestions are very
welcome.

Gregg Dameron

My appologies Mikhael.. I forgot to send a cc to
fvwm@fvwm.org .. so you have an earlier email
responding to this in your migo account.

FvwmCommand sounds perfect.. I'm assuming any command
or system call from a program will pass the command to
fvwm.  Is there a way to restart fvwm and specify
different fvwm config file.. or will I have to have
the program copy the desirable config to .fvwm2rc
before telling fvwm to restart?

I don't quite understand how this is supposed to work?  Do you
mean that when you initiate a stroke, a grid pops up to help
steering the pointer?

Just execute this commands in one or another way (from keyboard/mouse/menu
binding, from FvwmConsole or FvwmCommand):

  Restart fvwm -f another-rc-file   # put another-rc-file to ~/.fvwm/

Or if you want to keep exactly the same command line arguments as the
currently running executable, just:

  Restart

Not yet possible.

Although it is planned to be able to disable a titlebar border and/or side
borders in the future.

Hello,
How can I configure the transparency in 2.5.4, I cannot find anything in
the man page. I'm working on an OS-X Aqua theme, so it would be cool if I
could build in some tranclucent titlebars and menus or at least the round
corners.

You can see my current screenshot at

Hello.

I am running Fvwm 2.5.4 and would like to have new windows
focused as they are created. Currently this is not happening,
although new windows are raised. I have in my ~/.fvwm/.fvwmrc
configuration file:

    Style "*" ClickToFocus

How can I set that?

Romildo

here's a little hack^H^H^H^Hscript I wrote to do just what you are looking
for. You'll need fvwm version 2.5.x I think (for the perl libs), I use
cvs 2.5.5. I just added desk switching support.

NOTE:: Mikhael may be referring to a different solution, to which I am not
aware of...

anyway...

Copy FvwmTrackFocus.pl to your $FVWM_MODULEDIR and then add:

AddToFunc StartFunction
        + I Module FvwmTrackFocus.pl

to your .fvwm2rc

Restart and you're good to go.

No.  Probably after 2.6, but not currently.

Hello together, 

its me again ;). I just tried to configure FvwmTaskbar that it wont show
the annoying (for me) "Start" button. I cant find an Option for it in
the FvwmTaskbar Manpage.

And is it also possible to tell Fvmw2 that it wont let the windows
become under the taskbar? For example if i move a window it is not
allowed to go "under" the Taskbar?

Any Suggestions? Thanks,

-JASON

Currently, the taskbar always displays a Start button.  The best
you can get is an empty label on a very small button:

  *FvwmTaskBar: StartName

Do you mean that the windows should always be atop the taskbar, or
that fvwm refuses to let windows and the taskbar overlap?  In the
first case try

  Style FvwmTaskBar StaysOnBottom

In the second case you can only change the behaviour of the
initial window placement.  After that it's up to the user.  There
is some functionality tin the latest 2.5.x development code.  I
can't explain it in detail right now, but I described it a few
weeks ago in another mail on this list.  Look for "Struts",
"Placement" and "Penalties" in the mail archive and the man page.

(This needs its own section in the FAQ).

Bye

First, FvwmIconMan has never seemed to work for me.. 
I'm using a RH7.3 distribution (FVWM2 2.4.7?) and I'm
not sure where the Modules are located.

I'm trying to set up an 800x100 FvwmButtons bar that
has 3 rows and 25? columns (approx buttons are 32x32
(so a 2x2 would be a std. wm dockapp size)).  The
bottom row will eventually be for a "ticker tape" app.
 I figure I don't really need containers to do this
after reading the button positioning on the man page.

The following doesn't even produce a buttonbar - but I
think it's close to what I want.  Any help is
appreciated.



#Test Buttonbar
*FvwmButtonsGeometry 800x100-1-1
*FvwmButtonsButtonGeometry 32x32
#*FvwmButtonsBoxSize dumb
*FvwmButtonsBack bisque3
*FvwmButtonsRows3
*FvwmButtonsColumns 24
#*FvwmButtons(Frame 2 Padding 0 0 Container(Rows 3
Columns 10 Frame 1 \
                                           Padding 10

Hi,

I recently built and installed fvwm-2.4.13 (on i686-linux-gnu), upgrading
from 2.4.7. Almost everything works fine,

BUT: after a fvwm-restart all icons are in front of all windows, AND raising
a window does NOT bring the window in front of the icons. The only remedy I
found was to deiconify+iconify all icons. The config file is unchanged!

Is this problem known?
Any chance to get it fixed soon?

Please reply directly to me, I am not on this list.

regards
Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

Its no problem when the TaskBar is on the bottom.

Thanks a lot.

Learn about new colorset features from the man pages of fvwm and FvwmTheme
(but don't really use this module in 2.5.x). And NEWS, of course.

No round corners (or even colorsets) in titlebars in 2.5.4 yet.

No, your script^H^H^H^H^H^Hmodule seems to best answer the request, it
just does not autoraises. Probably Jason will find autoraising bad or
will be able to replace Focus with any other function.

I was able to install it without a problem now.  Seems changing my paths
(for the libraries and includes) to absolute paths from relative paths made
the difference.  I'm surprised this would be the cause of my error, but it's
something to think about for others having problems installing.

There is no translucent colorset in fvwm because X does not allow
it (it will be possible to implement translucent menu but this is
not implemented and I do not think it will be in a near future).

However, you have the Transparent Colorset option:

Colorset 5 fg white, fgsh black, bg grey50, Transparent

To get transparent menus: 

   MenuStyle * MenuColorset 5, Font "shadow=1 all:a font"

You can try to tint:

Colorset 5 tint black 15

but this is slow. To get fast tinting you should use

Colorset 5 RootTransparent buffer

in the place of Transparent. But you should use an Esetroot
compatible program to set your bg (fvwm-root --retain-pixmap).

The transparent colorset is not usable with title bar (and will be
never), but in a near future you will be able.to use RootTransparent.

The RootTransparent colorset is not documented in 2.5.4 because
it was not fully implemented. It is in the current cvs.

The great oracle Peter McAlpine <pmcalpin@uoguelph.ca> told me:

Thanks Peter, just a few minutes before i read your mail, i found an
entry in the mailing list archive (i think it was from you) just about
this problem and the solving script. :)

The problem for me is that i dont use the "unstable version". Is it
stable enough for the daily work? Easy to compile or any problems?

For 2.4.x i solved the problem by configuring Fvwm like this:

Key 1	  A    M    GoToPage1

AddToFunc   flipfocus-and-raise
+ "I" FlipFocus
+ "I" Raise

AddToFunc GoToDesk1
+ "I" GoToPage 0 0
+ "I" Next [CurrentPage] flipfocus-and-raise
+ "I" Prev [CurrentPage] flipfocus-and-raise

It works for a ClickToFocus-Environment but i will try the 2.5.x version
on the weekend and your script. 

Thanks a lot. 

-Jason

As stated in the subject. I'm using the 20021121 version. For as far as I

That is exactly what I meant.  Anyone with a reasonably steady hand (or
possibly a higher quality mouse) would not need that help.

And anyone with a decent memory would remember a few <key|mouse>
bindings and not need "stroke".
 
For users with steadier hands and better memories, it would open up other
combinations e.g. "157", "158","14563" and "14569".  The list grows.

I'm trying to build the snapshot from November 8, 2002. I need this
particular snapshot to run another program. Anyway, I attached the
output from 'make'. I don't know what I need to do to fix this
problem.
Thanks for looking.

-Chris

Its failing on 
bin/fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh (no rule).

Since that file was moved to a different directory on 11/09,
I guess the 11/08 snapshot had a problem.

You have 2 choices,

run with make -k (keep going after errors)

since you probably don't need that shell,

or download a more recent snapshot.

Yes, it is possible. Try something like this:

  ImagePath /dir/with/your/icons:+
  Style XTerm MiniIcon mini/terminal.xpm
  Style XCalc MiniIcon mini/calculator.xpm

How do you (or dtlogin) start fvwm?
What command do you use for Restart?

You should see an error message in the place where you have all X output.

There is almost no chances that Restart without parameters would fail.
Only if you removed or incorrectly replaced your currently running fvwm
executable (I don't know for sure about solaris8, but linux allows this).

Or maybe it always exits with your fvwm2rc (for example you have Quit
command in it), not just on Restart? If you can't find the problem
yourself, send your fvwm2rc. But first find the error message.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Some applications don't look right without them, like XMMS.

Hi,

I'm trying to set up FVWM2. However, browsing the man page is tedious since it 
is extremely long. Is it available divided into subsections in INFO, HTML, or 
some other format?

Felix

HTML:

I find reading man pages with XEmacs the best way to go.

Start XEmacs, type esc x man <return> fvwm2 <return>

I guess you mean, some applications don't look right with them.

For xmms, use:

Style xmms NoTitle, Handlewidth 0

Thanks, but it's not divided into sub sections and therefore offers no great 
advantage to the text mode man page for me.

That's what I'm doing (in EMACS) and I know that you can jump between sections 
with 'n' and 'p", etc.. However, I'm missing a table of contents and and easy 
way to browse the documentation hierarically. Annoying is for example that 
searching always applies to the whole document and not to a single section. 
Wouldn't it somehow be possible to create a decent info page from the man 
page?

Not bad, but still not convenient. It would be better if the document was 
separated into subdocuments, especially for searching.

Hi,

when I place the cursor on the top, bottom or side frame of a window the 
cursors shape is changed into the respective resize shape. However when 
pressing the left mouse button and dragging the cursor the shape changes into 
a cross and the window gets moved around and not resized. Moving around is OK 
but how do I change the misleading resize cursor shape?

Hi,

I want to scroll around the desktop only when hitting screen borders with the 
mouse cursor while moving a window and not when just moving the mouse. Is 
this possible?

Hi,

I set up key combinations (CA-Left, CA-Right, CA-UP, CA-DOWN) to move around 
pages on a desktop by 100% window size. But when pressing eg. CA-Left I 
expect the currently visible window below the mouse cursor to have input 
focus. To do this I guess it is easiest to focus the window below the cursor 
immediately after changing the page. But how do I set the focus to the window 
below the mouse cursor? 

You might wonder why I don't use desktops instead. Well, the reason is that I 
find it more intuitive to move between pages as described above than to 
switch between desktops that have no geometric relation.

I did this on my system:

$ cp /usr/man/man1/fvwm.1.bz2 ~/tmp
$ cd ~/tmp
$ bzip2 -d fvwm.1.bz2
$ man2html fvwm.1 > fvwm.html
$ htmldoc -f fvwm.pdf fvwm.html

It gave me a really nice pdf file with a table of contents, clickable
links, index, and the ability to search.

Yes, but in your case searching still affects the whole document or am I 
missing something?

In one posting you use the words ``sub sections'' and in the next
``subdocuments.''  I didn't try the other methods offered, but the pdf
file I got definitely has what I'd call ``subsections.''  I'm not sure
what you mean by ``subdocuments.''  Do you want every subsection in its
own separate file? e.g., name.foo, synopsis.foo, description.foo,
options.foo, anatomy_of_a_window.foo?  If so, how is having many files
--- instead of just one --- necessarily better for searching?

Yes, either each section in a different file or, as in EMACS info mode, 
browsable seperately.

For example, I don't like it if I search for "pager" in "The Virtual Desktop" 
and end up in "Initialization".

Ah, I see your point.  I know that some programs (on my system, at
least) have both man pages and info pages.  tar and gzip are two
examples that come to mind.  You may want to post a request for info
page versions of fvwm's man pages to the fvwm-workers@fvwm.org list, if
such requests aren't outside that list's scope.  Sorry my suggestion
wasn't helpful.

Hi all,

I use MouseFocusClickRaises but I'd like the click NOT to pass through
to the underlying application.  I tried setting
ClickToFocusPassesClickOff, it doesn't help.  I bet it only holds for
click-to-focus windows.  What else can I try?

Thanks,

It is possible to bind both Resize and Move on the window frame using
different mouse buttons. Resize using mouse button 1 is pretty standard,
this is why the the default cursor shapes show resizing.

This link discusses how both Resize and Move may be bound for a better
usability:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0207/msg00371.html

It is also possible to change cursor shapes using CursorStyle command.

Yes, sure, this is possible. The default behaviour of "10% of the page
scrolling" is pretty crazy, I think it should be changed to something
more reasonable. It is hard to believe anyone uses this default.

Anyway, use the following commands to get what you want:

  EdgeScroll 0 0          # disable page scrolling on mouse move
  EdgeResistance 1000 20  # enable scrolling of the whole pages
                          # on window move, but make it pretty resisting
  EdgeThickness 1         # the default is 2

You may play with these commands. The man page explains them well, but
you should actually try all combinations to understand how it works.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You probably want SloppyFocus or MouseFocus. Then a window that happens to
be under the cursor will be focused:

  Style * SloppyFocus

If you for some reason insist on using ClickToFocus policy, it's possible
to do what you want (but only in 2.5.x):

  Key Left   A  CM  GotoPageAndFocus -1p +0p
  Key Right  A  CM  GotoPageAndFocus +1p +0p
  Key Up     A  CM  GotoPageAndFocus +0p -1p
  Key Down   A  CM  GotoPageAndFocus +0p +1p

  DestroyFunc GotoPageAndFocus
  AddToFunc   GotoPageAndFocus
  + I GotoPage $*
  + I Next (HasPointer) Focus

You can try 2.5.x. What you want is:

  Style * FPClickRaisesFocused, !FPPassRaiseClick

fvwm-2.5.4

I've been having some trouble getting sound to work consistently well
with fvwm --- not that it's necessarily fvwm's fault.

When using rplay with FvwmEvent (with rplay (v. 3.3.1) support compiled in and
``builtin-rplay'' as FvwmEvent's Cmd), all the sounds are garbled while
typing ``rplay foo.wav'' from a terminal sounds fine.

With esd and artsd I've noticed that FvwmEvent will sometimes play the
same sound twice for one event and (as far as I can tell) apparently at
random.

What has worked best for other fvwm users?  I know this isn't the most
important function of a window manager, but I figured it might something
simple I'm missing.  Thanks for any input.

Well, I just now tried adding 

*FvwmEvent:	Delay 5

to my .fvwm2rc, exited fvwm, and started it again.  I still get the
quasi-synchronous two sounds for one event.

Thanks. I must have overlooked
  Note that, with
    EdgeScroll 0 0
  it  is  still  possible  to  move or resize windows
  across the edge of the current screen.   By  making
in the man page.

--------------9CB170E2D0631A8DFF2F6796
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I'm trying to add a background to my menus and used the MenuFace
TiledPixmap foo.xpm command under MenuStyle *.  The pixmap seems to load
OK, but it's displayed as the dithering of very few colors (looks
awful).  I'm using 2.5.4 on Solaris, and built fvwm with XPM and
PNG support with no problem.  My Icons, such as Netscape, appear in
color with no problem.  Do I have to explicitly specify somewhere in the
.fvwm2rc file to use a certain number of colors for pixmaps?

Thanks
Ben

Do you have a screen which can use 256 colours only?

Does the problem occur only when you use netscape or others apps which
use a lot of colours?

Is the result better with:

Colorset 5 bg average, fg the_color_you_want_as_fg, TiledPixmap foo.xpm, nodither
Style * MenuColorset 5

fvwm has a lot of options for screens which can display only a few
colours at once. Unfortunately, the doc and some of these options
was written after 2.5.4.

I suggest you use a recent snapshot and take a look at the doc (man
fvwm) for: -color-limit, -strict-color-limit, -allocate-pallet,
-static-pallet, -named-pallet.

Regards, Olivier

How would that work?

A simple perl module manipulating a row of buttons (or tabs) could
just hide/show appropriate windows ... but wouldn't fvwm treat it as
a separate app & give it its own border/move them separately/etc?

SCoTT. :)

Definitely not.  I can view the pixmap file fine with 'xv'.   Not to mention
browsing the web or viewing images certainly shows more than 256 colors.

Problem occurs when no other apps are even open.

the 'nodither' option makes it look somewhat better, but it's still displayed with
very few colors.  When I remove 'nodither' it looks as it had when I used the
MenuFace parameter of MenuStyle.  I'll look more into these other options you
mentioned

For some reason my FvwmButtons won't create 3 rows. 
I've tried 

*FvwmButtons: Rows 3
and 
*FvwmButtonsRows 3

My version is 2.4.7

I would add that I am in the same boat. I have some backdrops that never seem
to come out with correct colour (look badly dithered to a small colourmap, very garish).
Whilend others that come out fine.

I'm fairly sure that it's image specific. I'll try to verify this later
today and if so, email you a "good" PNG and a "bad" PNG. With your
consent, naturally - they're probably large. And I haven't eliminated
mogrify from suspicion at my end yet, but I suspect it's not the culprit.

As with Ben, I'm using 2.5.4, full colour display.

I'm using a PNG generated from a JPG with ImageMagick's modulate command, thus:

	mogrify -modulate 70 -format PNG tmpfile.jpg

and applying it like this:

	ColorSet 0 AspectPixmap "tmpfile.png"

Internally, is FVWM on a full colour display making some kind of mapped
colour image when it sets up the Pixmap for a menu background?

More than just xterms, I hope.  Gotta stack my vim's, too.

I hoping to get back to something a lot like this after I finish up the first
run on another module.  I did an ion-like module a while back, but it
turned out to get a bit more complicated than it was really worth.  There are
some screenshots at http://imonk.com/baboon/FvwmPartition.
At least one of the pictures has two windows in the same pane.

I'm thinking of simplifying it a bit by removing/deactivating the
subdivision functionality and then concentrating on the tab and
launch capabilities.

Never mind. My problem turns out to be a bug in mogrify's modulate option (or
in my understanding of it).

I'll shift to using fvwm's Ting and Alpha colorset arguments.

Doh!

The options I mention are useful only with screen with a few colours
(depth 8 screen). xdpyinfo or PrintInfo Colors (in a FvwmConsole,
output into stderr) give the information about the depth you have.
The problem is not the one I thought. Maybe a image loader bug.

Yes you can send me images. If there are large just to me.
Also, the output of xdpyinfo and PrintInfo Colors (fvwm cmd)
can be useful as well as your machine architecture and os.

I tried it here at work.. but I've noticed it's REALLY
flaky... the settings you gave me didn't work.. (just
like FvwmIconMan doesn't work).  I'll try it at home
where I have 2.4.13 - it's the one that REALLY matters
anyway ;-).

Thanks.

Maybe you should repost the config you are using.
The one from a few days ago seems to be full of problems.
When fvwm read this in, there were probably a load of error
messages being printed on Fvwm's stderr.
You should strive to eliminate all errors too.

Heres your config from a few days ago with some notes:


> #Test Buttonbar

Always start with:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons:*

that way if you re-read the config its always clean.

> *FvwmButtonsGeometry 800x100-1-1

Use the newer format with the colon:

*FvwmButtons: Geometry 800x100-1-1

its easier to read.

> *FvwmButtonsButtonGeometry 32x32
> #*FvwmButtonsBoxSize dumb

Remove all commented out lines, its easier for us to read.

> *FvwmButtonsBack bisque3
> *FvwmButtonsRows3

The space before the 3 is missing.

> *FvwmButtonsColumns 24
> #*FvwmButtons(Frame 2 Padding 0 0 Container(Rows 3
> Columns 10 Frame 1 \
>                                            Padding 10
> 0))

This looks like its meant to be a continued line, but the
first line is commented out.  The remaining lines should be causing errors.

> #*FvwmButtons(3x2 Frame 2 Swallow "FvwmIconBox"
> "Module FvwmIconBox")

same here.

> *FvwmButtons(6x2 Swallow "FvwmIconMan" "Module
> FvwmIconMan")

Continued lines need a backslash...see more below.

> *FvwmButtons(3x2 Swallow(UseOld) "FvwmPager" "Module
> FvwmPager 0 0")
> *FvwmButtons(2x2 Frame 2 Swallow(UseOld) "wmmp3" `Exec

I was able to reproduce the problem.
There were a few stacking code changes in
2.4.13, perhaps you should try 2.4.12 until this is fixed.
(Look under "older 2.xx. versions".)

Annoyingly, this seemed to work yesterday :-(
I'm using 2.5.4, full colour display.

I have the following base menu config:

	Colorset 2      fg rgb:90/ff/ff, bg rgb:00/00/20
	MenuStyle "*"   AutomaticHotkeys, Animation, SeparatorsShort, TrianglesRelief, BorderWidth 0, \
			HiLight DeepSkyBlue, Shadow paleblue, \
			MenuColorset 2

That all seems good.

Now, I have a menu-backdrop chooser that says:

	ColorSet 2 plain, bg darkgreen, Tint cyan 50, Alpha 70, AspectPixmap "/path/to/thing.png"

The "bg darkgreen" is a debugging setting to make sure the command got applied.
Anyway, the backdrop pixmap never seems to be applied.
Am I doing something obviously wrong here?
Maybe reapply the MenuColorset?

Also, my final design probably wants to look like this:

	Colorset 2      fg rgb:90/ff/ff, bg rgb:00/00/20
	Colorset 3      fg yellow, bg rgb:00/00/50
	Colorset 4      fg darkgray, bg black
	MenuStyle "*"   AutomaticHotkeys, Animation, SeparatorsShort, TrianglesRelief, BorderWidth 0, \
                	HiLight DeepSkyBlue, Shadow paleblue, \
			MenuColorset 2, ActiveFore, HilightBack, ActiveColorset 3, GreyedColorset 4

I presume I'll have to apply the AspectPixmap to all three colorsets, or
maybe discard them and just use one colorset?

Hi Dan,
thanks for your reply.

I can actually live with the problem; after all 'fvwm restart' isn't done
too frequently, basically only if something hangs.

Any idea how soon this will be fixed (and the next version released)?

Even more annoyingly, it's working fine now.
I'm at home, on a different machine, but it's the same fvwm.
Hmm. I'll try it again at work tomorrow and see what's up.

This is not good, please take a look at your X output.
There are no such MenuStyle options "HiLight" and "Shadow".

Works fine for me.

You don't need to reapply MenuStyle. Colorsets start to work in all places
where defined in the moment you change them.

Define all three, but first clean it, remove "HiLight" and "Shadow" as
unexisting options and define shadow colors (sh, hi, fgsh) in colorsets
if needed.

Only the first colorset uses AspectPixmap, other two do not use any
images, so if you define AspectPixmap there, it is ignored.

There may be currently some problems with the new functionality.
For example if you define any *Alpha in the greyed colorset, its
background becomes black until Restart, so just don't do it for now.

Mikhael.

If you don't like that an Alt release closes a menu, do it like this:

  Key F2 A M WindowList SelectOnRelease "" NoGeometry

Or if you want to completely disable this feature:

  MenuStyle SelectOnRelease Shift_R

Yes, you should specify a valid key here only, specifying no argument or
empty or invalid key restores the default Meta_L (left Alt).

It seems that the automatic MenuStyle default "SelectOnRelease Meta_L"
is not appreciated by all users. It is good for Alt-Tab binding only.

I finally got to working on this at home.  This
solution worked well.  Thanks, Dominik.  I still think
my fvwm that came with my RH7.3 installlation at work
is flaky.  Or maybe the .fvwm2rc that RedHat provides
is trash.  I'll try this new config at work and let
you know.

Is there a way to have an xterm started in a buttonbar
start a console app on startup?  Of course, this only
applies to the xterm in the buttonbar.

Thanks,
Rick

Start up the xterm using the -e arg:

xterm -e tail -f /var/log/messages

ok.. xterm is in my button bar and the program
executes perfectly ...PROVIDED... the fvwm is not
restarted AND an xterm window is active on the
desktop.

I believe UseOld allows F-Buttons to swallow the
xterm, but how do I keep it from picking an xterm I
started.  This application doesn't require the old
xterm to be loaded.  I tried NOT using UseOld - and
the xterm wasn't swallowed.

Thanks for the help,
Rick

And now it's working at work, too. :-(

My prime suspect here is ImageMagick's mogrify, which I'm using to
convert JPEGs to PNG. (I was doing the colouring with mogrify too,
which is why I wasn't using "djpeg | pnmtopng").

I've discovered that the RedHat version (5.3.8) dumps core on several
files.  After installing 5.5.1 it no longer dumps core, but does emit a
file whose name consists of random binary bytes instead of the supposed
"foo.PNG".

I've hacked my scripts to work around this latter:

	cp foo.jpg tmpdir/.
	cd tmpdir || exit 1
	mogrify -format PNG foo.jpg || exit 1
	rm -f foo.jpg
	mv ./* foo.PNG
	... tell fvwm to load the image ...

which is nice and robust.

And now it all seesms good. No troubles on the fvwm side at all.

Cheers,

fvwm-2.5.4

I've been trying to rearrange my fvwm configuration so that .fvwm2rc
essentially has a PipeRead command that looks for and reads any files it
finds with a certain extension.  Carrying this over to menu
configuration, I tried having one file per application and having in
each file both Style information and an entry to add it to the menu.
What happens is PipeRead reads in, for example, mail.men first then
term.men --- with the first file having information for mutt (which is
running inside an xterm) and the second for xterm.  The problem is that
since term.men gets read secondly, its ``Style XTerm Icon terminal.png''
overrides the ``Style mutt Icon mutt.png'' command, even though the
window containing mutt has ``mutt'' as its title --- not ``xterm.''  If
I rename the files so that term.men gets read first (by prepending a
zero to the file name), then mutt has the icon it's supposed to have.
Is there a way to ensure that a window will have the ``right'' icon,
regardless of the order in which fvwm reads its Style command?

Thanks for any help.

No.  The last issued style command always wins.

OK.  But why does mutt ``inherit'' xterm's icon when the window titles
are different?  Doing an xwininfo on mutt's window shows its title to be
``mutt'' and there is no mention of xterm in xwininfo's output.

Thanks.

Because it runs in an terminal which has the class "XTerm".  Run
FvwmIdent on the mutt window to see it.

And there's no way to force the class to some other value?

According to the xterm man page, the class can be set with the
-class option and the resource name can be set with -name.  But
that does not mean your xterm or whatever terminal you are using
supports that too.  Try

  $ xterm -class mutt -name mutt -e mutt

   when I hit the keyboard shortcut that brings up the WindowList 
appears but as soon as I let go Alt (part of keyboard shortcut) the 
WindowList disappears (therefore I cannot use it to switch focus to 
another window).

   not sure when this behaviour started, some time ago it worked 
properly (I hit keyboard shortcut, the WindowList appears and stays on 
the screen until I hit esp or number letter ...)

   it works properly when invoked via mouseclick or via popup menu.

   system:

     debian unstable (and default debian fvwm config)
     fvwm 2.4.10

   the only relevant config items (as far as I can tell, I grepped for 
WindowList)):

   in menu definition:

+ "Alt-F4:  Window List"                 WindowList

   shortcuts:

Mouse 3   R  A  WindowList
Key F4    A    M    WindowList

   any ideas? (I just re-read WindowList part of manpage, didn't find a 
clue)

   TIA!

That is because they are using the SelectOnRelease option for the
WindowList command.  You can still use the list as long as you do
not release the Alt key.

To remove the select on release behavior, use "selectonrelease"
without a key name following it:

Key F4    A    M    WindowList SelectOnRelease

My root window key bindings have never worked.  This is the set of bindings 
currently shipped with SuSE, with the exception of PointerKey instead of Key, 
because I'm using SloppyFocus.  These bindings didn't work with Key either. 
Mouse bindings work fine.

I looked at the header file for keys, also.

What else would affect these?

Whether the num-lock, scroll-lock is pressed.  See question 0.1

Thanks.  Setting the -class option alone did the trick.  I'll try to be
more thorough in my man page reading before posting next time.

Hi,

I've just compiled fvwm-2.5.4 on sparc/solaris, partly because I'm
playing with the latest Gnome beta, and its apps close to those
translucency-endowed png bitmaps. But fvwm doesn't render the PNGs
right - they're in shades of blue, the translucent areas are completely
absent, there are weird offsets and splashes of yellow where they don't
belong.

I've tried compiling with two different versions of libpng (1.0.12 that
came with Gnome, and 1.2.4) and it doesn't make any difference.  Also,
the Gimp that I compiled with the very same libraries has no
trouble with the PNGs.  Has anyone seen this before?

There was such color conversion for png, but it was fixed in 2.5.2.

As for transparency/translucency, it all depends on where you try to
apply the png images. If there is no good background to be used as the
basis of png, libpng can't be informed to use translucency.
It may require some preparations.

Please send the relevant configuration and png files, or put them on the
web. Then maybe some suggestions are possible.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There is probably a bug in 2.5.x for rendering images on a
machine with bigendian byte ordering (and no XRender ?).

Can you see the following line just after png configure check:

  checking whether byte ordering is bigendian... yes

when you run ./configure?

Also, as you run Solaris I imagine that at the end of configure
you can see:

  With Xrender image support?         no: ...

yes?

Dominik,

I guess you haven't committed the fix yet?

When you do, would you like me to test it and then create 2.4.14?

I see.  I only committed my changes to the dev branch yesterday.
Later.

Yes, that would help a lot.  We spend too little time testing the
stable branch before the releases.

Since I haven't heard any solutions to FvwmButtons
using any "random" xterm on restart.. I found a simple
solution.

As xterm is not a particularly large program.. in fact
I also found an xterm3d (does anyone know the
difference between these two?)..

I'm currently using xterm3d for the executable on the
button bar.. if I don't have xterm3d at home.. I'll
just create a copy of xterm with a different filename
and execute it that way so it doesn't pull my regular
xterms into the button bar on restart.

I'd be glad to hear any other suggestions.

Rick

People, do you read other messages on the list? :)

Just yesterday, there was an answer to the same question.

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0211/msg00719.html

Another example. Two days ago there was an answer to the WindowList
question and yesterday someone asked the same question. Strange.

Sorry, Mikhael.  I didn't realize they were one in the
same issue.  I don't see how the WindowList
correlates.. but I did skip over the icon issue
because I avoid icons in general in my FVWM.

So if I assign the "class" on the xterm and use that
with my FvwmButtons... when I restart it won't just
pull any recently clicked xterm from my desktop.. only
the one of that class?

Am I understanding this right?

I tried the -class assignment on my swallowed xterm in
my buttonbar...  If I open another xterm.. on restart
the xterm on the desktop (not in the buttonbar) gets
put in the buttonbar.

I'll go back to using a different executable.. xterm
isn't that big to copy

The syntax is this:

  *FvwmButtons: (Swallow "SpecialXterm" `Exec exec xterm -name SpecialXterm`)

> I'll go back to using a different executable.. xterm
> isn't that big to copy

You don't need to copy on unix, a mere symbolic link would be enough:

  ln -s /usr/bin/X11/xterm ~/bin/specialxterm

I've just started using rdesktop to connect remotely to a Windows 2000 box
(it's a really handy program), but I've got a problem: my control and alt
keypresses are being passed through when sometimes I'd rather they
weren't.  I use C-arrow to move around the virtual windows, but when I
have the rdesktop window in focus I lose that ability.  I have to move the
mouse, bring something else into focus, then do C-arrow.  Is there some
way I can stop fvwm from passing through particular keystrokes to certain
windows?  I looked through the man pages and did some searches but didn't
see anything matching the keywords I could think of.

Thanks,

Bill

I'm attaching the configure log.  It did check for bigendian byte ordering
after looking for png, or at least it says it did.  And yes, we have no
Xrender. (Is it for XFree86 only?  Anyway I think rendering would cause an
unacceptable performance hit on my poor little 330 MHz ultrasparc.)

Dorothy

       By default the keybindings of the windowmanager will be  ignored
       when  the  rdesktop window is in focus. Use this setting to keep
       the windowmanager keybindings.

It's hard to say what is going on without seeing what events
inside fvwm cause the the frame to disappear.  I can't imagine why
fvwm should tell the window to close itself.  I guess rm6 isn't
available freely (and on Linux) so I could try again?

There's a bug I found in fvwmpager 2.5.4
When I set NoSeparators it's got 100% CPU and does not work.
SolidSeparators works fine.

This is already fixed a month ago in cvs. Try the latest daily snapshot.

Thanks, but I'll wait until 2.5.5 is released. I can live with
SolidSeparators, as long as I can adjust the color. :-)
It even looks nicer if you can barely see them, instead of not seeing
them. :-))

for those who are using fvwm 2.5.4 & don't want to build from cvs,
attached (patch-modules::FvwmPager::x_pager.c) is a patch which
cured the problem.  apply it in fvwm-2.5.4 directory.

patch was generated from differences in x_pager.c versions in fvwm
cvs (as of ~ nov 1 2002) & fvwm 2.5.4 source.

I have a different but related problem: I use Lotus Notes under wine,
and when I use Ctrl-Alt-arrow to switch desktops when wine is in
focus, sometimes the Ctrl/Alt keypress _is_ sent to wine.  When I
return to wine, it thinks that Ctrl or Alt was pressed but never
released.

I suspect that this is wine's problem, but is there some workaround I
can use in fvwm, to tell it not to pass those keystrokes to the window?
