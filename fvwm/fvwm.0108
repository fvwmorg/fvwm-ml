I don't think so, I don't see anything in the "Next" logic that
would make it wrap around.

The built-in alt-tab binding does allow for wrap around.

Since the used desks can have any number (e.g. -1) your patch is
only a solution for a few desks.  The idea is certainly a good
one, but we need to spend more thoughts on the implementation.
I will record this as an enhandement request for now.

Hey all,

Just upgraded to 2.4.0 on RH 6.2 and am having a 'sticky' problem(sorry,
couldn't help myself).  I have a button that kicks off xmms:
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title xmms, Icon starMask, Action `exec /usr/bin/xmms &`)

it's just like other I have:
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title Moz, Icon wingdogs, Action `exec /usr/bin/netscape &`)

except xmms now, with 2.4.0, is sticky.  I've even tried a line like:
Style "*xmms"       NoSticky

to no avail.  Anybody have any ideas why?  A pointer to some docs that I
might have missed would be much appreciated.

This has been annoying me for quite some time now.  In releases previous to 2.4
the Next command would wrap around, which made things rather nice for working
with lots of xterms.  The built in alt-tab seems to be a window list, which is
a rather poor substitute.  So does anyone know how do wrap around focus
switching without the window list?

This is not correct. Next and Prev are circular commands.

This question was asked several times, so I will add it to FAQ.

"Next Focus" should normaly circulate around all matching windows.
But if some window does not accept focus, it may break circulation,
because "Next Focus" makes the problematic window current and tries to
give it the focus, this fails and the previous window stays focused
forever while you execute "Next Focus".

Receiving the focus may fail becuase either a program sets "Focus Policy"
to "No input" or a user explicitely gives a window NeverFocus style.

There are 2 solutions to solve breaking circulation. The first is:

  Style * Lenience

This instructs all (or some) windows to accept focus regardless of what
the program requests. The second solution is to find a problematic window
and make it CirculateSkip, for example:

  Style XClock CirculateSkip
  Style FvwmPager CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip

Mikhael.

There is no style named "NoSticky".  Try this one instead:

  Style xmms Slippery

No go - it is still sticky.

Some further info that may or may not be useful.  I looked for anything xmms
in the .fvwm2rc.  There are only the 2 lines:
Style "*xmms*"      Slippery
*FvwmButtons(NoSize Title xmms, Icon starMask, Action `exec /usr/bin/xmms &`)

I was wondering if it was getting started somehow linked to fvwm so tried
changing the line:
Style "Fvwm*"       NoTitle,  Sticky, WindowListSkip

to
Style "Fvwm*"       NoTitle,  Slippery, WindowListSkip

with no effect.

I also tried global Slippery, e.g.:
Style "*"           Slippery

still no effect.

Thoughts?

<snip>

There's a "Sticky" checkbox in xmms' Options menu that seems to override
the Slippery style.  Did you try disabling that option?

Aack!  That was it.

I never thought to check xmms itself since there was no problem until the
upgrade to fvwm2.4.

Tnx all for the pointers.

If you want to simulate the previous behavior, i.e. ignore all xmms hints,
you may use:

  Style xmms GNOMEIgnoreHints

Hello, I'd really like to be able to get Icons to always deiconify on
specified pages of my virtual desktop.

e.g. I have
+ Style "emacs*" StartsOnPage 0, SkipMapping
+ Style "*" Sticky Icon

What I really want is :

+ Style "emacs*" DeIconifiesonPage 0

Or something like that ?!

Thanks in Advance,

	Steve Roome,

P.S. I'm not subscribed to the mailing list, so please CC me!

Hello,

Could someone give me some pointers to where I can learn how to write
.fvwm2rc files?

I've noticed several nifty screen shots and accompanying files at various
places on the web, so obviously many people have learned how to do this.  

So far, however, I've not found any websites that give a run down on what
the various commands are and how to use them.  Do such exist?

I was ready to submit a bug/enhancement request regarding something
that I posted awhile back and peered at fvwm's bugzilla; to my
surprise there are lots of bugs/requests outstanding (some from
'98 :-).

Are there any plans for an fvwm release addressing all those bugs
and enhancement requests (ie. strictly a bug-fix release) ?

Has anyone gone though all those bugzilla postings ??

Thanks

Uh, I think you're misreading something.  The one confirmed bug still open
from '98 that is still open is marked "fixed in 2.1.5" in November of that
year but was never closed, probably because the submitter never reported
back on whether the fix worked or not.  There really aren't that many open
bugs.  Are you misunderstanding the meanings of the various categories of
cleared bugs?

BTW, to be pedantic, we aren't running Bugzilla, we're running Jitterbug.

Well, bugs will be fixed in 2.4.1.

TF> Has anyone gone though all those bugzilla postings ??

They're being goen through all the time.  The fact that there are only 25
new and 6 confirmed while there are over 500 cleared reports should tell
you something.

G'day Dan,

have a look at http://dotfiles.com/ they have a big selection of Fvwm
dotfiles and a example is the best place to start from

then read the man pages for fvmw (all the modules have man pages too.)

Hi,

   I recently upgraded to a new linux machine running RedHat 7.1.
and installed fvwm 2.4.0. Things went fine and I did some 
customizing to get fvwm to do what I wanted. I then shut the 
machine down, moved it to a new spot beside my desk, and restarted.
Things looked fine upon startup, but now NOTHING happens when
I click any mouse button!? The mouse is active (the cursor will
move around as I move the mouse), but no windows pop up when I
press the mouse buttons and there is no response when I click
on a menu button. All I did (I think) was reboot the machine and 
it now appears the mouse buttons don't work. Any help with this
problem would be greatly appreciated!!

Subject: FVWM: fine-tuning Smart Placement ?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Is it possible to tweak the placement algorithms in 2.2.4 short of
hacking the code?  Using

    Style "*"  RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement

I'm getting results that seem slightly odd.  For example, creating
six 80x30 xterms (FvwmIdentify reports Width: 499, Height: 394,
Boundary Width: 6) starting on a blank page, they appear at:

    +2+1   +517+1   +1032+1
    +1+428 +516+428 +1031+428

leaving two-pixel gaps between them.  I would prefer, instead:

    +0+0   +513+0   +1026+0
    +0+425 +513+425 +1026+425

to leave no visible gaps.

After I manually tighten up the arrangement to my preferred layout,
if I create an 80x24 xterm (Width: 499, Height: 316, Boundary Width:
6) it lands at +1+855, which causes its bottom border to spill onto
the next page down by two pixels.  The decision to align at the
bottom instead of to the windows above is fine, but to be flush with
the bottom the Y placement would need to be +853 instead of +855.

In case it matters, this is on Red Hat 6.2.

Hi,

This is certainly a strange problem :-) How far did
you move your computer? Since you say that the mouse
moves around, then I assume that X-window is up and
running ok, and that the problem is with FVWM2 (which
in itself is unusuall!!).

Have you tried another window manager, besides FVWM2
(say for example, twm??), to see if the mouse bindings
work ok there.

In FVWM2, does the root menu appear when you click on
the root window (i.e. the background)? If it does then
this is good, since it means that FVWM2 is recognising
your mouse buttons ok.

You might consider posting your config files to the
list (preferrably in "tar.gz" format), that way we can
test them.....

Also, it might be worth taking a look at
"~/.FVWM2-errors", which is the errors file that is
produced. Maybe that will yield an explination.
(you'll have to check the file which belonged to the
user that logged off prior to the "accident").

I hope I have helped you a little....
Let me know how you get on,

Regards,

Thomas Adam

Hello,

   in the Emacs init file I have code to position it's window on startup 
in the left upper corner. It is positioned correctly under KDE. (2.1.1) 
Under fvwm (2.4.0-2.rh7, RedHat 7.1) the window title is out the screen. 
It seems the title size and border is not accounted in the left corner 
position calculations.

I had to correct the position like this:
(setq initial-frame-alist '((top . 22) (left . 5) (width . 110) (height 
. 43)))


Now under KDE the emacs window is shifted lower.

Question: is this supposed behavior of fvwm?

Thank you,
Andriy

But it would certainly be a useful addition to the Xinerama extension to
send "EnterXineramaHead" and LeaveXineramaHead events  - IIRC X 
extensions can introduce new events.  If these events contain the a
head number, interested applications can then easily maintain information
about the set of heads the pointer is in (even for the pathological case
of overlapping heads).

Just upgrade to 2.4.0 and it should work fine.

Yes.  There is a clean way to position a window on the screen that
works for all window managers, but it seems that emacs does not
use it.

Does anyone know if you can you make the "grabable" range of a border larger? For example the cursor turns into the resize arrow if it's within 2 px from the border.  The benefits of this is that regardless of what the border size is, it's always easy to grab.

Only by making the borders larger:

 - Use a good config file as base and look what fvwm can do.
   Some examples come with the source distributeion.
 - Read the fvwm2 man page and the module's man pages.
 - There are also some nice examples in the FAQ.
 - Don't hesitate to ask questions on the mailing list.

The one problem I see that was reported in '98 is that obnoxious
FvwmTasbBar AutoHide feature.  I guess that will never be fixed
but instead be implemented in fvwm's core some day.  This is why
the report was never closed.

Well, most things in Jitterbug were already fixed.  There *are* a
lot of bug reports lying on my disk that are not in Jitterbug
though.  The current statistics look a little nicer.

I'm reading "The Concise Guide to XFree86 for Linux" by Hsiao, published
by Que. In it, he says that "an adequate tutorial [on fvwm2] would
require a small book of its own." Well, is there such a book? I don't
find the man pages adequate, and the web site doesn't have much more.
I've subscribed to this list to learn more, but I'm still only
scratching the surface of this wm.

Hi,

Yesterday, it occurred to me: wait a minute: why have I not upgraded
my fvwm (my system came with 2.2.4)?  I was astounded, as I could not
come up with a reasonable answer.  Needless to say, I immediately
upgraded to 2.4.0 and am very pleased with the changes.  Thanks a lot!
You guys rule!

Playing around with it also brought up an old issue, which I still
don't know how to solve:

On startup (in InitFunction), I like to start up one xterm and one
emacs, and have them treated specially for the duration of the
session: I want the xterm to be sticky, and I want special keybindings
that will immediately take me to both of these windows.  But the
following doesn't work, and my other similar variants don't either.

AddToFunc InitFunction 
+	'I'	Exec exec xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmaprc
+       'I'     Exec exec xbiff -geometry 50x50+1080+5
+	'I'	Exec exec xterm -font 7x13 -geometry 55x8+765+5 -T BANG
+       'I'     Wait xterm
+       'I'     Next FlipFocus
+       'I'     Stick
+       'I'     Key Return A 3 WindowId $w FlipFocus
+	'I'	Exec exec emacs -f eshell
+       'I'     Wait emacs
+       'I'     Next (emacs) FlipFocus
+       'I'     Key Return A 3C WindowId $w FlipFocus

The problem begins with Stick, but I suspect that my Key commands
aren't set up right either (although I know that Mod3 is set up right,
as it works in other, more standard situations).  Could you show me
how to make this work?

BTW, the problem with Stick is also a problem I sometimes have with
FvwmCommand.  Say I try (I know this is a silly example):

% FvwmCommand 'Stick'

Fvwm seems to wait for me to select a window, but I want it to just
use the current one.  There are other commands with which I have the
same problem.  But I'm probably just using the wrong approach, right?

Thanks in advance for any help,

cyp

i don't know if this is a bug or what, but i have the following line
in my .fvwm2rc :

Style "*" ActivePlacement

for the first, maybe, 10 seconds after startup though, it goes all
RandomPlacement on me. after a little, things quiet down, and i am
prompted to place new xterms i invoke.

so should i post my .fvwm2rc, so you guys can see everything, or is
the cure immediately obvious?

also, is there a analagous option to ActivePlacement that would prompt
be to draw out the size of the new window as well? like in plan 9.

thanks,
brendan

We've had complaints that the fvwm man page is too big.
Someone claimed that it was the largest man page ever created,
but we found a couple that are larger.

I believe all aspects of fvwm configuration are covered in the
man pages.

For HOW-TO type information, the FAQ is often helpful.

To learn more, ask specific questions and stay subscribed to this
list.

If you can identify things that you think are missing from the
man pages point them out.

Maybe convert most of it to an "info" and make the manpage a
summary .... NOT!!!

Why would anyone object to a large manpage?  Beats having to look
in unexpected places, and/or not having complete docs at all.

You probably have

  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

or

  Global SmartPlacementIsNormal

In your config file.  In 2.4.0, all the placement options were
rewritten and renamed.  The new code is almost, but not
completely compatible with the old code:

 - The GlobalOpts command has been removed.  The placement options
   are now style options.
 - The placement style options were all renamed so that only a
   single placement style has to be used:

     ManualPlacement
     CascadePlacement
     MinOverlapPlacement
     MinOverlapPercentPlacement
     TileManualPlacement
     TileCascadePlacement

 - The old styles and GlobaloptsOptions are replaced with regular
   style commands.

Actually, this means that

  Global SmartPlacementIsNormal
  
is the same as

  Style * TileCascadePlacement

and 

  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart

is the same as 

  Style * MinOverlapPlacement

in 2.4.  This explains why your style does not work: is it
overridden by the later globalopts line.  You can find a complete
conversion table for the styles in the man page.  Also, it is a
good idea to use one of the new styles, in your case

  Style * ManualPlacement
 
If all this still does not help you, post your configuration file.

Just press mouse button 2 when placing the wire frame of a new
window.  This finishes placing the window and then allows to
resize it.  (If you are using "Emulate Mwm", use shift-button1
instead).

When you run a command that needs a window to work on, the window
is usually chosen from the context the function was invoked from.
Usually, the context window is simply the window you clicked on,
but it can be something else or even unset under some
circumstances.  This is why you need "Next FlipFocus" to focus the
window, not just "FlipFocus".  It is important to know that the
context window does not change during function execution.  Thus,
the "Stick" line refers to the original context window again, not
to the one just focused.  "Next Stick" should work.  The "Key"
lines do not work for the same reason.  In addition, the "$w" is
replaced by a more or less random window, even if you use
"Next Key ..." since it is replaced at the time the "Next Key ..."
line is executed - and at that time the window was not yet
selected by the "Next".

I recommend doing this stuff in a separate function:

  Style BANG Sticky

  AddToFunc WaitAndFocusAndKeybind
  + I Wait $0
  + I Next ($0) FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $w FlipFocus

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Exec exec xmodmap $HOME/.xmodmaprc
  + I Exec exec xbiff -geometry 50x50+1080+5
  + I Exec exec xterm -font 7x13 -geometry 55x8+765+5 -T BANG
  + I WaitAndFocusAndKeybind BANG Return A 3
  + I Exec exec emacs -f eshell
  + I WaitAndFocusAndKeybind emacs Return A 3

(untested)

You get the idea.

Try 

  % FvwmCommand "Next Stick"

or

  % FvwmCommand "Current Stick"

instead.  When commands are executed from a module, there may not
be a context window to operate on, so fvwm asks for user
interaction.  To select a window automatically you have to use one
of the conditional commands.  If you would like a module command
to fail quietly if there is no window to operate on you can use
the "Silent" command prefix:

  % FvwmCommand "Silent Current (xterm) kill"

This would kill the current window if it is an xterm and do
nothing otherwise.

Hi!

After trying out fvwm 2.4.0 a while, I finally came up with a use for
my "thumb button" (Logitech MouseMan+). My thought was that if I have to 
press alt to be able to draw a gesture, then I might as well press 
ctrlalt-enter to open a terminal and skip libstroke altogether.
But if I, on the hand, was able to use only the mouse to draw gestures, 
then it would suddenly a useful feature.

Enter the "thumb button". Counting the mouse wheel as two buttons, there
was sadly no mouse button left for fvwm to detect (the old X heritage
of a maximum of five buttons). I thought I'd let the program imwheel 
map button clicks to keystrokes for me. Now we're getting to my
problem.

Mouse   3       W       M       StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion
StrokeWidth 2
Key     Home    A       CS      StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion 
StrokeWidth 2 NotStayPressed

Using the alt+mouse3 works great. DrawMotion works and the functions are
run. Using the "thumb key", or pressing "Ctrl-Shift-Home" directly, 
only DrawMotion works... _no_ function is run. Appending NotStayPressed
to the alt+mouse3 line works fine, I just click a mouse button after 
I'm done with the gesture. No matter what I do after drawing a "thumb 
gesture", I can't get a function to launch.

Thoughts anyone?

I am a systems Admin that uses rm6 on a pretty regular basis. I started
using fvmw2 and fell in love with it's configurability at home. I just
installed it on my work Sparc and am running into one small problem.
Everything works wonderful with the exception of when I bring up rm6 from
one of the production machines I work on. The window keeps disapearing on
me. I have checked the error file I have created and xconsole and neither
show any information as to why it would crash like this. Has anyone else
experienced this? If so can you help me out?

What I think a lot of users want is a place to find a nice set of .fvwm2rc
example files with accompanying screenshots. I have seen such places on the
net but most of them are small and outdated. Just making sure the
screenshots page at fvwm.org page has a wide range of screenshots with
accompanying .fvwm2rc file would be a nice start. It would also be nice if
this page had examples (screenshots and config files) that demonstrated the
new features in FVWM 2.4.

Nice.  I will try that when I get home.

I do too.  I think the fvwm man page is great.  It just took me a while to
get thru it, but that is because there is so much to get thru.

One thing that zsh has done is split it up into smaller chunks (man zsh, man
zshbuiltins, man zshexpn, etc.), and then also have "meta-manpage" that
includes all of it (man zshall).  I always fire up the whole thing "man
zshall" and then search for what I want.  Without that, I would be lost,
because, if I was stuck and didn't know what to do, I wouldn't necessarily
know which man page to look in.

I also, absolutely hate the Linux documentation is moving; that is, having a
man page that is a summary (at best) or not even there or out of date, and
having the real doc in "info" format.  I hate that.  On Unix, I expect the
man pages to at least have a proper command-line usage, if not the entire
documentation.  (okay, off the soapbox, back to your cell...)

What would be nice is a command summary, so you dont have to look thru
*everything* to find what command you want.

I agree.  I would be happy to send (again, I think) my .fvwm2rc file to
the fvwm.org screenshot maintainer to include with my screenshot that's
there.  I found a few dot files on the web and that's how I learned how to
configure things (that, and trial and error, grep, and RTFMing).

i'll contribute. my .fvwm2rc is simple and clean and should be easy to read.
a little too minimalist for some, maybe.

i think it would be best if fvwm.org/screenshots would become the place for
this; currently it doesn't look like .fvwm2rc files are attached to the
pictures though. fvwm.themes.org is currently dead, and iirc, was pretty lame
to start out with (though i haven't been there for a while).

to whom should i send these things?

I'm reluctant to include entire .fvwm2rc files.  I  think they are too
hard to sort thru and contain things  other users don't want.

How about creating new pages for window decorations, menustyles,
and FvwmButtons layouts, similar to whats already done for Vector
Buttons?

Dear List,

I have yet another problem. This time, I am trying to
get FVWM2 to recognise a particular window, based on
its ID. I have tried using FvwmEvent to capture this
window ID, but so far, I am not having much luck.

What I would like to happen, is once FVWM2 detects
that this window has appeared, I would like for it to
be
"closed" and NOT killed, since killing this window
closes the entire application. Has anyone got any
ideas??

I have tried to follow the examples in the manual
pages (FVWM2 and FvwmEvent), but either I am a
luddite, or
I do not fully understand what I am doing!!

I assume that the FvwmEvent modules is what I am
supposed to be using??

Thank You for your help,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

FVWM Themes is the configuration framework for FVWM that enables users to
choose from multiple configurations created by others or create their own.
The project is aimed to serve novice FVWM users as well as experts.

The new version is based on the stable fvwm-2.4.0. It is available from:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/

Changes from the 0.4.2 version:

  * The package is now divided to fvwm-themes-base and fvwm-themes-extra.
  * Theme names are now shown in mixed case (Default, CDE).
  * New themes: BrushedMetal, nanoGUI, Mech, Unsafe.
  * New titlebar button order selector, see buttons in multichoice theme.
  * The component list is rearanged, one component renamed, three added.
  * New component fonts@ may be used to change fonts globally.
  * Added support for several euro-asian charsets.
  * Components or variants not supported by the user's system are hidden.
  * Improvements in several themes, including Default and OSX.

The base package includes the framework and 8 main themes. All additional
themes (currently 8) are moved to the extra package, it is planed to grow.
The base package may be installed by the usual ./configure and make.
The extra set of themes is optional, README explains how to install it.

The theme screenshots on the web page are updated and a new page for
Window Decorations, that currently includes 26 screenshots, is created:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/windowdecors/

Enjoy. :)

Regards,
Mikhael.

That sounds like a good idea. Remember to include screenshots, people love

I agree! The temporary fvwm.themes.org (now destroyed) was only hastily
constructed in about an hour and only intended to be online for a month
or so.
A totally new themes.org server has been built from scratch and will be
online in the next few weeks.

I'm hoping to primarily continue supporting and promoting the
fvwm-themes project (http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net) as its design
and the implementation of the many features of fvwm is spectacular to
say the least. Also most window manager's eventually adopt a universally
acceptable theme engine packaging system for theme configuration
trading, and fvwm-themes has been optimised to take the greatest
advantage of the latest features within the vast array of fvwm commands.
It is quite simply and naturally, fvwm's future and redefines the whole
concept of desktop theming. As many on this list have pointed out,
fvwm's man page has become cumbersome and necessarily complicated. With
fvwm-themes however, a menu and/or gui is all that is required to have
your desired configuration created on the fly. Those who may have tried
it already and found it wanting should recheck the latest version from
time to time as development progresses swiftly and improvements are
constantly being added. Feature requests and contributor's are also
greatly desired.

Having said that, I have also given thought to including a more
traditional fvwm2rc file section to the new fvwm.themes.org as well.

Much of fvwm's power and attraction comes from the fact that a short and
simple config file can provide a huge variety of desktop glamour.

Those wishing to contribute their config's and screenshots will be
welcome to submit them to fvwm@themes.org for inclusion. New staff
always welcome. :)

Oh great, I just got the first page set up and ready to upload.

I don't want to cause any conflict, but I think theres a place for
hand created configs and another for GUI created configs.

I'll upload what I have to fvwm.org and we can move it around if needed.

Hi there!

I am looking for the following feature:

  Mouse Button Windowname Modifier Keyevent

which should map the mouse-button event over windows named
'Windowname' to some key-event.

Background: I simply can't get the mouse-wheel working for the
Mathematica FrontEnd. With a functionality like above I could map
the wheel to "PageUp" and "PageDown". This would help with any program
which ignores button-events (like Mathematica's FrontEnd).

Is there any other way you can think of, how I could map the events? I
don't want to change my windowmanager to scwm (which apparently can do
the trick mentioned above).

Thanks a lot in advance!

Regards,

Jens.

I sometimes receive from other people tarballs with their full fvwm
configurations, screenshots, even rpms. I then put what I get to:

  http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/data/samples/

So, if you send me or to fvwm@themes.org a tarball with anything you want
like fvwm2rc, pixmaps, other tarballs, screenshots (but not more than 2Mb)
I or Alex will unpack this tarball to your own directory on that page.

Another option is that you convert your config to a theme in fvwm-themes
format, then your theme may be loaded/unloaded on the fly by other users.

If you send something innovative, I and Olivier (another developer) may
convert it to a theme ourselves and include to the next fvwm-themes-extra.

Regards,
Mikhael.

First, determine whether X sees your thumb button. Fire xev and press
this button to see whether it generates any event.

It is possible to configure XFree 4.x to work with more than 5 buttons.
you may optionally remap button numbers using something like:

  xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 6 3 2 4 5"

then, supposing you mapped your thumb button to mouse button 4, use:

  Mouse 4 A A StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2

Actually, it is possible to make it work even if thumb button has number
greater than 5, for example 6.  For this to work you may apply the
following one-line patch, so that fvwm may work with any button number:

In file fvwm/bindings.c replace this line and reinstall:
-     if (button < 0 || button > NUMBER_OF_MOUSE_BUTTONS)
+     if (button < 0 || button > 9)

Then you may do something like:

  Mouse 6 A A StrokeFunc FeedBack DrawMotion StrokeWidth 2 NotStayPressed

But remember to use NotStayPressed, because X does not support dragging
of buttons with numbers greater than 5.

Continue to ask if you still have problems.

Mikhael.

See FAQ question 3.18, it explains several solutions with and without
FvwmEvent depending on your needs.

If you know window id or window title or both use one of the commands:

  Next ("My Window Title") Close
  WindowId 0x140000e Close
  WindowId $w ("My Window Title") Close

I've created a "Menu Samples" page.
If anyone would like to submit a Menu screenshot and matching fvwmrc
file they can do so.

Right now its OK to send them directly to me.

Designs for the window decorations page will be accepted also.

Thats actually a good idea, being an Emacs person I almost always have
an info window open in a separate frame when I'm editing a config file
and I find the links and references in a well written info file more
helpful then a really long page of plain text.

I thinks I might make this a project if I can find the time

Hi. just like Dan, I too am looking for more info
on .fvwm2rc files. I have read the man page and
forgive me but the man page just does not give
enough information. I have seen the man pages and
the fvwm web page and read all the info that I
could find but what I really need and want is a
good reference manual or something similar. I
have asked before on this list but no one
responded. I need to understand the syntax of the
.fvwm2rc file. I have seen clips of others' and
they are a bit cryptic to a beginner. I know it
can't be _that_ difficult to learn, but I also
don't have the time to play with it and figure it
all out.
thanks

xucaen

Hi, I have just a few questions about this
response;

> 
>  - Use a good config file as base and look what
> fvwm can do.

where can I find a good config file? Would anyone
on the list be willing to post them or email
them?
Does anyone have a config file that is well
commented? (specifically comments describing the
syntax)

>    Some examples come with the source
> distributeion.

I have looked in my debian fvwm docs directory
but did not find good examples. Is there
someplace where I can download examples?

>  - Read the fvwm2 man page and the module's man
> pages.

I have read the fvwm's man page but it isn't what
I need. I need docs that are more technical
syntactically. Where are the man pages for the
modules? I don't think I have them on my debian
system.

>  - There are also some nice examples in the
> FAQ.

If you are refering to the FAQ at fvwm.org, I
have read some of it and found this to be the
only place I have ever been able to find
examples. But unfortunately for me the examples
aren't descriptive enough. I am very unfamiliar
with fvwm modules, their use and their syntax.
(The descriptions of the modules on the web page
did not make sense to me.)

>  - Don't hesitate to ask questions on the
> mailing list.

I realize that no one _has_ to answer emails
posted to the list, but it seems that no one will
answer me.. either my emails are not getting
posted or no one has the information I am looking
for. (I don't know which) I will keep searching
for information as time permits and will keep
asking questions. I also have seen others asking
the same questions I have asked and the answers
to these questions have been very helpful, so I
will keep reading this list. I am sure that
sooner or later I will figure out fvwm, I just
want it to be sooner than later..

thanks!!

You dont say which fvwm version you are using.
fvwm -version will tell that information.

Fvwm usually comes with example configs so "locate fvwm2rc" should find
them if they exist on your system. Otherwise there are some useful
sample configs fairly well commented at
ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/sample.fvwmrc/

The syntax for each command is clearly defined in man fvwm2

Similarly man FvwmButtons and man FvwmBacker and man FvwmPager etc...
will tell you about all the module commands. Running xman is generally
the quickest way to find and browse the man pages of available commands
on your system.

There are usually example configs for each of the modules included with
each installation, try "locate ConfigFvwm" to find those files.

I hope you don't now get flooded with too much information, but don't
hestitate to ask for more if this is still not enough.

here's a quick question; In my debian
installation when I use man I can only page up,
page down and scroll. Is there a way to do a
search in man?
(perhaps man man will tell me?  ;-)
         ^^^^^^^ I'm not home right now and
cannot try this.

  what about fvwm.themes.org?

  it was re-born recently and the problem was that it was only for new
2.3 (development) series now the 2.4 is out I guess fvwm.themes.org is
the place to go for configs etc...

  it doesn't work at the moment because of security breach but I've
already seen it and it looks very promising. They suggested a way to
organize the config files so that you can change different aspects
separately (window look, keyboard shortcuts, menus etc.), you can change
themes without restarting etc... it looks like it's still work in
progress but it is already usable (or at least it was usable when I
tried it with 2.3 some time ago).

  I wonder why didn't anybody mentioned it yet (in this configuration
thread) - is it down again? what's the status (I cannot check it since
the site is currently down)?

  /string will probably search for a string.

  actually man only find the proper manpage, it uses external program
(pager) to view the manpage.

  to find out which viewer is used:

  run man (to see any man page, e.g. man man)
  in different session (window) run pstree and look for the man - the
last thing on that line os the pager program, e.g.

  `-xdm-+-XFree86
    `-xdm---sh-+-ssh-agent
      `-x-window-manage-+-FvwmAnimate
        |-FvwmAuto
        |-FvwmCommandS
        |-FvwmPager
        |-gkrellm---gkrellm
        |-netscapeMail.pl---communicator-sm---communicator-sm
        |-oclock
        |-soffice.bin---soffice.bin---5*[soffice.bin]
        |-2*[x-terminal-emul---tcsh---mc---tcsh]
        |-x-terminal-emul---tcsh---man---sh-+-nroff---groff-+-grotty
        |                                   |               `-troff
        |                                   `-pager
        |-x-terminal-emul---tcsh---bash

  in the example above it's program called pager (which pager shows it's
/usr/bin/pager, which is a link to /etc/alternatices/pager, which is a
link to /usr/bin/less, that's the debian way to set the pager for all
system, if I would like to use different pager I would use
update-alternatives --config pager to make pager point to some other
viewer)

  you can specify which pager to use:

  specific pager, use following command line option):

    -P pagerName

  no pager, the output goes to stdout:

    -T

  specific pager (using environmental variable):

    export PAGER='/usr/bin/less' # sh and derivatives (bash, ksh)
    setenv PAGER '/usr/bin/less' # csh and derivatives (tcsh)

  you can put the setting of PAGER variable to your shell's startup file
to have a permanent setting

The best way I know of the read man pages is inside Emacs or XEmacs.

1. start (x)emacs.
2. type Esc X man Return
3. Type the name of the man page "fvwm2" Return.

You now have an emacs buffer with the man page in it.  All the emacs
search, and positioning commands work.

If thats too much for you, try "xman".

I believe most versions of Linux use "less" to display the man page.
Do "man less" for more information.

Yes fvwm.themes.org is again offline due to the illegal activities of
certain hackers. A totally new and revamped themes.org server is under
construction and should be online within a few weeks. I have already
responded to this thread, but for those who missed my earlier response,
users can submit their configurations and screenshots for inclusion when
the new fvwm.themes.org becomes operational again. In the meantime Dan
Espen is posting various parts of configs such as window decorations,
menus etc.... for examples of individual elements of fvwm2rc creation.

Of course the fvwm-themes project at http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net
allows an extremely flexible and a huge variety of configuration choices
without knowing a single fvwm configuration command. Creating new and
additional components is also easily achievable with the documentation
and directions included.

The screenshot page at www.fvwm.org has "Last Updated: October 14, 1999."
at the bottom of it. When I choose "View Page info" in Mozilla it says
it was last modified "Sun, 21 Jan 2001".

Does the applications crash completely or is it just the window
that disappers (perhaps moves off screen)?  I guess you are
implying that the applications works well under CDE?  Can you find
any more symptoms of the problem?  It is hard to say anything
since "window disappears" is way too vague to hunt down the
problem.  You could perhaps try to run fvwm with an empty config
file to see if it is related to the configuration.  Also, if you
post your config file to the mailing list I can see if I can find 
something suspicious.

Which fvwm release do you have?

Is there a core file around or does the window just disappear?
If you can reliably make it disappear, and theres no core file
or error message, perhaps running it under truss will reveal something.

I guessed that rm6 is part of Veritas.  I didn't see any fvwm related
problems in the Veritas knowledge base.

I think you are talking about GNU projects when you say `Linux
documentation'. The GNU Project has long had the policy of maintaining
primary documentation in texinfo format, because that is convertible to
more output formats than troff, and is more expressive. Sometimes, man
pages for some projects were separately maintained, but they always got
out of date.

However, recently the GNU help2man program was released to convert the
invocation sections of info pages to man pages, and new releases of GNU
projects are tending to use this to generate up-to-date man pages at
last.

(Also, I don't think it's info pages you dislike; it's the standalone
info *reader*, which is horrible. There are much better combined
man/info readers out there, like tkman; find one you like and use it,
and you'll soon ignore the source of your documentation --- except that
info pages are often better written and less terse than man pages ;) )

Ok, the sticky business worked fine.  But the Key commands did not
work as expected.  They seemed to do nothing (although they are bound,
since the application doesn't see these keys).  I tried replacing the
FlipFocus above with Beep to see if it did anything, and it did in
fact beep.  So it appears that the FlipFocus isn't working as I
expect.  Now I'm thinking that the problem is that $w is being
replaced when the command is executed and not when the command is run
(which corresponds to what you're saying above in the "Next Key"
discussion, right?).  Which makes sense to me, but I did not consider
it before.  In that case, the FlipFocus would always just give focus
to the window that already has the focus, which has no visible effect.
Is this what happens?  If so, is there any way for me to make this
work still the way I want?

I've been meaning to do it for ages, but this discussion prompted me to 
finally put my configs on my web site.  My setup allows changing decors 
without restarting.  It's done quite simply, with no perl scripts or 
extra programs.

Some of the decors are visually quite fancy.  (Some of them are rather 
girly, too.)

I've posted them, with snapshots of the window decorations, at
<http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm/fvwm-decors.html>.  There's a 
tarball that has the xpms for the buttons and icons.

Cheers,
Dorothy

Hm, neither of these setting should have such an effect.  I could
imagine that *not* using NoPPosition might show a problem, but not
the other way round.  Is there any chance I can test this myself?
Where can I get this application?

I honestly do not know :)

You have to quote the '$' to protect it from being evaluated too
early.  There is a logic behind it, but even I can exactly tell
how many '$'s are necessary except by trying.  One of these lines
should work:

  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$$$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$$$$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$$$$$w FlipFocus
  + I Key $1 $2 $3 WindowId $$$$$$$$w FlipFocus

After looking at the man files that came with my slackware 7.1, all I
see are files about modules. Obviously, I'm missing something here. I
got fvwm2 going by copying the supplied system.fvwm2rc file to my home
directory and renaming it ".fvwm2rc". Then I hacked it up a
little.....but I don't have much of a clue about what I'm doing. I
appear to have fvwm version 2.2.4.....OK, so I went to the fvwm web page
and found the huge man page for fvwm2. How do I get this in "man page
format" whatever that is? I saved it as html, but I don't think xman
reads that format. I've got some reading to do....

You should be able to bring up the man page by typing:

man fvwm2

The man page in html format was created from the man page in
man page format.  There is now way to convert it from html to man
format.

If the fvwm2 man page got deleted from your setup, you should be able
to download fvwm 2.2.4 and extract the man page from it, or you
might want to just install the current release 2.4.0.

	There are 2 possibilities I can think of. 

	1) In xman, did you look for "fvwm" (all lower case) or "fvwm2" - all
the module stuff shows up early in the index, because the names all
start with "Fvwm", but fvwm is lower case, and therefore shows up
farther down.

	2) The xman config can be set up to show things differently from the
standard search order you would expect judging from the MANPATH. I doubt
that this is the case, but if it is you would see a file called mandesc
in one of more of the root directories of the various man hierarchies -
e.g., /usr/man, /usr/local/man, /var/man, etc.


Cheers,
Bob

The only way to test rm6 is getting a sun box with Solstice Disk Suite
on it. Unfortunately I don't have one that can be accessable by non

i have teh following line in my .fvwm2rc:

Mouse 1 W M Move

that is, hold alt and click anywhere in a window with the left mouse button
to start a move operation.

i use click to focus.

so, this binding only works on the focused window.

i would like hold alt and be able to click on an unfocused window and have
it behave the same way. i have tried to implement this with a function:

AddToFunc "raise meta move"
	+ I Raise
	+ I Move

AddToFunc "raise meta move"
	+ I Raise
	+ M Move

AddToFunc "raise meta move"
	+ I Focus
	+ M Move

... etc ...

but none of these variations seem to work.

Style * ClickToFocusPassesClick

doesn't help. by its name it *really* seems like it should fix my problem,
so i guess i don't understand something.

any ideas?

I guess nobody ever thought of this problem.  When the focus click
occurs, and ClickToFocusPassesClick is set, fvwm focuses the
window and passes the click to the application, but does not check
for bindings.  Anyway, since the window will always get focus when
you do this, you just have to click on the windows once and can
use alt-click immediately afterwards.

Hey folks.  Long time fvwm2 user here (they'll never get me back to
another wm now!).

Anyway, I switched my OS over to FreeBSD recently, and wasted no time
making use of the fvwm2-devel port (2.3.?).

Of course, now that fvwm2.4 has been released, the devel port is
marked as broken in deference to the fvwm2 port.  Problem, it wants to
build with gnome all of a sudden.  The 2.3 port at least made this an
option, and I avoided it intentionally.

Last time I tried to build any of the gnome ports on a FreeBSD system,
it took over a Gig of disk space to corral all the dependencies
(something like 6 deep and 7 wide!).  Good thing I had just upgraded
the system to a 40G drive!

How tough would it be to get this built *without* gnome?  I really see
no reason to build it in, since I haven't made any significant config
changes since 2.2, and I won't be using any of the fancy new stuff
anyway.  Besides, the system I am hoping to get the upgrade on may not
*have* the space for this kind of extensively dependent build.

I suppose I could stick with 2.3.x, but I'd kinda like to play with
some of the sound toys and get the added stability, maybe learn a
little more about the other toys?

TIA

Lou

Does

./configure --disable-gnome

help?

Not tough at all. The current port in x11-wm/fvwm2 should build okay
with "make WANT_GNOME=no" without the hours and hours of compilation.

Hi,

I'm using the super key (defined as modifier 5) often combined with the
shift key to interact with my window manager, i.e. I have defined
a whole bunch of lines like e.g.

Key	i	A	5	Iconify

after a while I ran out of mnemonic <super>-<char> combinations so I started
combining them with the shift key, like:

Key	x	A	5S	exec xterm


For some odd reason the following 4 key combinations don't work:
<super>-<shift>-s
<super>-<shift>-w
<super>-<shift>-x
<super>-<shift>-2

but all other <super>-<shift>-<key> combinations work just fine.

Of course I can live without those 4 combinations, but 'inquiring minds
want to know' :-).
This seems like a typical Murphy since the first 2 combinations I defined
where <super>-<shift>-w and <super>-<shift>-x (for starting an xterm and a
web browser). So first I thought <super>-<shift> might not work at all, but
it was just bad luck :-).

To make sure that this wasn't caused by anything else in my .fvwm2rc I tried
this also with a .fvwm2rc file that contained nothing but a few of these
key definitions.

BTW I'm running fvwm2 2.2.4 on HP-UX B.10.20 but the same 4 keys don't work
on my Linux PC either.

Klaus

No, not with the port.  The Makefile has a variable that appears to be
hardcoded, to yes (WANT_GNOME=yes), and then checks to see if another
is defined (HAVE_GNOME).  It isn't real clear what make parameter will
tell the port to use the --disable-gnome config directive.

Another suggestion in this thread was "make WANT_GNOME=no", but
WANT_GNOME is just redefined back to yes and gnome-libs is still
included.

Maybe I'll have to hack the Makefile myself.  Perhaps the port
maintainer is listening?

I'll probably send directly to the maintainer if I can't get around it
correctly.

Thanks all.

hello,

I'm running fvwm 2.4

and, after an uptime of 2 days, FvwmPager begin to crash when i change from
desk...

I had to add this line to make the pager re-appear :
Key F10 A S FvwmPager * *
(and i have to press shift-F10 when the pager crashes)

Is there a way to print debug information ? when the pager crash ?

thanks

You have to locate the core file generated by the pager.  Then,
call

  $ gdb FvwmPager core
  (gdb) where

(assuming you have gdb).  This prints a stack trace of where the
pager has crashed.  Also, there may be some interesting output on
the console.

I suggest to use "./configure --help" so that we don't confuse each other.
Reading INSTALL.fvwm before anything else is good too. :)

It should be "./configure --without-gnome" to force the building without
gnome-libs. But if there is no gnome installed this is automatically used.

I am not sure what this Makefile wants to achieve regarding GNOME:

  http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ports/x11-wm/fvwm2/Makefile?rev=1.31&content-type=text/plain

because gnome-libs support is already autoconfigured in fvwm.

And it seems they did the same error as above (I don't really know their
intension). --enable-gnome is good, it has nothing to do with gnome-libs,
but with gnome-wm hints. Non GNOME applications may use these hints too.
I may rename this option to --disable-gnome-wm if this helps.

Regards,
Mikhael.

This option puzzled me a bit too when configuring. I would suggest to
rename it to --enable-gnome-hints, though.

I assume you mean --disable-gnome-hints? I agree that it sounds more clear
than disable-gnome-wm since that could be interpreted as "disable the
window manager gnome". I'm not saying Gnome is a window manager, but a lot
of user's aren't clear about the difference.

Well, thats where I stopped.
Its not clear at all:

./configure --help
...
  --disable-gnome         disable GNOME window manager hints
...23 lines...
  --with-gnome-includes   location of GNOME headers
  --with-gnome-libs       location of GNOME libs
  --with-gnome            prefix for GNOME files (not needed for GNOME WM hints)

Looking at the last option, it looks like it should really be

--with-gnome-prefix=PFX

but that would lead to the even more confusing:

--without-gnome-prefix=PFX

How about:

  --disable-gnome-hints   disable GNOME window manager hints
  --disable-gnome         disable GNOME
...23 lines...
  --with-gnome-includes   location of GNOME headers
  --with-gnome-libs       location of GNOME libs
  --with-gnome-prefix=PFX prefix for GNOME libs and headers

INSTALL.fvwm contains more than a one line description for every configure
option and common situations.

The stuff that generates these lines is taken from the standard gnome.m4.
The logic is not trivial, it has no sence to change names without changing
the logic. Since everything works well, there is no reason to change logic.

For most of users the defaults (no gnome options) should be more than ok,
because gnome-config returns the place of includes, libraries and more.
It is also not critical if FvwmGtk is built without gnome-libs.

The problem of the original poster is due to the FreeBSD port that
by default requires GNOME libs. It is not FVWM that requires this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

hello,

i looked through the list archives and the FAQ, tried couple
of suggestions but could not find the solution.

when i open a search box for netscape (or certain other
transient boxes, like add files in xmms) the window is always
opened in the upper-left-hand corner of the display, and no
attention is paid to my ActivePlacement setting.

Could someone let me know if it is possible to place
transient windows, such as "find" in netscape/mozilla in
pre-specified positions? 

i have fvwm 
   
   [FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.2.4 compiled on Jan 19 2000 at 00:53:30

the relevant portion of .fvwm2rc is below.

   Style "default-style" UseDecor default-decor, Color Black/#40a0c0
   Style "*" MWMFunctions 
   Style "*" MWMBorder 
   #Style "*" MWMDecor
   Style "*" DecorateTransient
   Style "*" RaiseTransient
   Style "*" StackTransientParent
   Style "*" NoDecorHint
   Style "*" ActivePlacement
   Style "*" NoPPosition

i am new to this list, so please excuse me if i missed some
similar discussion a while back.

I renamed --disable-gnome and added explanations about --with-gnome.
Is there anything in INSTALL.fvwm now that needs more clarifications?

I currently have the following modifiers (accourding to xmodmap):

  mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
  mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)

And for me both bindings (with Super and with Scroll_Lock) work well:

  Key  x  A  4S  Exec exec xterm
  Key  x  A  5S  Exec exec xterm

However, I run panel (from GNOME) and the following does not launch xterm:

  Key  g  A  4C  Exec exec xterm

Instead the panel's menu is invoked. Ctrl-Super-G and Ctrl-Super-R are
handled by panel globally in my case.

It is likely that you run some application that receives your keys before
fvwm or any other application. You may verify this with an empty fvwmrc
using xev.

Mikhael.

Did you try imwheel program? I didn't, but it seems like it should help.

Have you checked your file permissions?  Maybe the file is in the path but
doesn't really exist, or it needs a different version of cc than what your
running?

Hope that helps you some.

This is exactly what imwheel does, so it's definitely the way to go. The
config file might be confusing at first, but it will allow you to map
specific programs with the mousewheels.

You may have /usr/ucb/cc in your path, but that "cc" is not a compiler.
If you haven't already done so, you need to download gcc.
Also look at the CDs you got from Sun.  I've read that recent
releases include a freeware CD which includes gcc.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm & xlock interaction
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hi,

I'm writing my own xlock program (yes, I have too much time on my
hands, and I like to play) and I came across some strange interaction
between fvwm and my program. I've appended my .fvwm2rc and my program
below. It's fvwm 2.4.0 on a Solaris 5.6 machine.

What happens: as you can see, I have an fvwm keyboard shorcut (^F12)
to start my xlock program. When I use the keyboard shortcut and the
keyboard focus is in a window, I get an "XGrabKeyboard failed with
code 1" error message from my program on my console (error code 1
being X11's "AlreadyGrabbed"), most of the time. I also get an
"XGrabPointer failed with code 1" error message most of the time when
I try to start my xlock program the same way (i.e. with the focus in a
window), but through a menu (not shown in my .fvwm2rc here). I say
"most of the time", because from time to time my program actually
works and locks the display... It also always works when no window has
the focus and I use a keyboard shortcut or a menu to start it, and it
also always works when I start it from the command line (regardless of
whether any window has the focus at the time it's started).

Now, since I'm using fvwm's SloppyFocus, I wasn't too surprised to get
an AlreadyGrabbed error when trying to grab the keyboard while a
window had the focus, since I guess fvwm implements that feature by
grabbing the keyboard itself. I'm already less sure about why fvwm
would grab the mouse while openning a menu (I haven't read fvwm's
code, so I might be wrong...) but it seems to be what it does. It
would also explain why my program works when no window has the
focus. I have no idea, then, why, when I use my program from the
command line, it works regardless of whether any window has the focus
or not. I also have no idea why it does actually work from time to
time when some window has the focus and I use a keyboard shortcut or a
menu. I also tried running fvwm without using SloppyFocus, but
basically got the same result: as soon as a window has the focus, my
program doesn't work (most of the time, but not always) if I start it
from fvwm.

The other funny thing is that the system-provided xlock works every
time, regardless of how I start it or whether any window has the
focus.

So I guess I'm either doing something wrong in my program, or I'm
missing something somewhere. Does somebody have a clue ? Any help will
be appreciated...

I haven't actually subscribed to the list, so please put me in copy if
you reply.

Thanks a lot,

Philippe (and yes, I use goto)

You can't even prevent that the keyboard or the pointer is grabbed
in X if you want that input.  When you click in a window (or press
a key for that matter) that takes clicks (or key presses), that
window grabs the mouse (keyboard) automatically.  This is a
feature of X to prevent that other applications can grab the
pointer (keyboard) in the time before the click and the moment the
application would grab the pointer itself.  Key and button actions
in fvwm are often triggered before the passive grab is released,
i.e. while the button (key) is still depressed.

That depends on the focus model as well as on the bindings you
have on the window.

> menu.

Because the grab has already been released when the program makes
its call.

This would probably work if you disable the raise-on-click feature
of the focus model:

For 2.3.x or later:

  Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

For 2.2.x:

  GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise

Anyway, there is a simple solution that is independent of the
window manager:  simply retry grabbing the pointer/keyboard after
a few milliseconds.  Fvwm itself always retries this for up to
five seconds before finally giving up.

Hi,

what do I have to configure to flip through the window list
(or even better Icons like in M$ Windows) by pressing
<Alt-Tab> repeatedly. When <alt> is released the window
where the cursor is on should be chosen. Just like in
M$ Win. The Window list should preferably be placed
in the center of the screen.

I think it's a default setting, isn't it?  I know that it just works
for me, and I've never explicitly set an Alt-Tab keybinding.  It just
goes through the Window list, which shows the title bar of the
windows.

I've been looking at the tabbed window supports in PWM as even with
the assist of virtual desktops and IconMans I have problems keeping
track:

  http://www.students.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/

Is there any interest or motion toward addind tabbed window supports
to FVWM2?  If I did a patch, what are the chances of it being picked
up?

  just my opinion:

  it looks extremely useful, as long as it's easy to (de/a)ttach windows
to given frame (e.g. by dragging the title - is that how it works?).

Funny.  How does this exactly work?  Do the windows actually share
the same frame?

If this can be done it would certainly be welcome.  But you should
not simply write a patch and then send it to the list because the
patch will be *very* big.  You should subscribe to the
fvwm-workers mailing list and discuss this feature there.

Jason Weber wrote us some months ago about his (pre-)alpha module:

  http://www.imonk.com/baboon/FvwmPartition/

It suggests a bit different solution for tabbed windows that may share the
same space or not.

I'd be curious as to how this would fit in with the current decoration
scheme, now we have frames, handles, buttons and titles.

I'd imagine the title area could be split up with 3d boxes.

I don't know how the buttons, frames and handles fit in.

Looking at FVWM 2.4.0, I see that the user can specify only one window
name in each condition list.  In particular, you can't have:

Key F1		A  N	Next (CurrentPage xterm1) goto-window
Key F2		A  N	Next (CurrentPage xterm2) goto-window
Key F3		A  N	Next (CurrentPage console) goto-window
Key F4		A  N	Next (CurrentPage emacs) goto-window
Key F5		A  N	Next (CurrentPage Netscape konqueror) goto-window
Key F6		A  N	Next (CurrentPage xdvi xpdf gv acroread) goto-window
Key F7		A  N	Next (CurrentPage xv ee gimp) goto-window
Key F8          A  N	Next (CurrentPage !XTerm !emacs !Netscape !konqueror \
					  !xdvi !xpdf !gv !acroread !xv !ee \
					  !gimp) goto-window

which is what I have now in my .fvwm2rc, after making the changes in the
patch at the end of this message.  The patch is short and simple; it uses
a fixed-size array rather than a linked list, and demands that each list
of windows either be all of windows to use, or all of windows to not use;
there is no attempt to introduce any kind of boolean algebra.  (Boolean
algebra would not only be more complicated to program, but also more
complicated for the user, and, I think, usually needlessly so.)

I wonder if this patch, or something to the same effect, could be added
to the mainstream version, so that I wouldn't have to keep it around and
keep adding it to new versions.  I'm willing to revise the man page to
describe the new behavior.

You need to download the precompiled version of gcc
from sunfreeeware.com

Add the pkg

Then add the location of gcc to your path.

Then you'll be able to compile fvwm

well tried it again with an empty fvwm2rc and still all 4 keys wont work
neither on my HP-UX workstation nor on my Linux PC, i.e. xev doesn't notice
these 4 keys at all.
Maybe you're using a newer version of fvwm2 (I'm using 2.2.4).

  well, if xev does not detect those keys then there is no way any other
program (using X keyboard input) would (AFAIK)

  if you use X 4.x you can take a looks at the keyboard models available
(or check the xkbd extension and create new model), on debian the files
are under /etc/X11/xkb

If these keys do not generate KeyPress/KeyRelease events in xev, the
problem is either in X that does not recognize these keys, or in some X
application supposedly run in .xinitrc does something about these keys.

If you want to be sure that it's not an FVWM problem, create .xinitrc file
(or its equivalent) with one line "exec xterm -e xev" and rerun X.

Mikhael.

Hi,

when I switched to Fvwm 2.4.0, I found that some dialog windows lack a
title bar. Well, a 'Style * DecorateTransient' in my .fvwm2rc cured that,
but the buttons of those windows are still problematic.

First I should describe the setup of my window buttons:
On the left side I have 1 button for the window menu.
On the right side there are 3 buttons: minimize, maximize and close, in
left to right order.

Transient windows have only one button on the right side. In principle
this is fine, but it seems to be the minimize button (i.e. the leftmost of
the right-side buttons). When I push it, the application usually behaves
quite oddly: the dialog disappears, but the program thinks it is still
there, but the dialog doesn't have a window list entry on its own.
Sometimes I can recover by minimizing and unminimizing the whole program.
You see that this button is rather useless on those dialogs. Therefore
I would prefer the close button in these dialogs instead. Formerly I used
Fvwm95 (hence the button layout), and there it worked this way.
By the way, most of the dialogs, that behave like that,  are produced by
the Qt toolkit.

So, what controls which button is displayed in transient windows? Is there
a way to change it?

Thanks in Advance!

Jochen Klenner

Hello,

at the moment I am using fvwm1 with its build in pager (not the pager as a
module). This pager allows to set the focus to a certain window on any
virtual desk just by left clicking it with the mouse. This moves the focus
to the clicked window and the viewpoint to the desktop the window is on.

The FvwmPager module shows a different behavior. With the left botton you
just change the viewpoint to the selected desktop while the middle button
set the focus to a certain window.

I prefer the behavior of the built in pager. But in version 2 there seems
to be no bulit in pager. Is it possible to set up the pager module in a
way that makes it works like the built in pager? What can I do to set the
viewpoint and the focus with a single mouse click?

Tschuess
	Stefan

Hello all,
I'm using a few gnome icons in xpm format for my
FvwmButton bar.  Under gnome the icons look fine but
when in fvwm the icons are displayed on my button bar
with a black background.  My button bar is grey, so
the only thing I should see is the icon with a grey
background.  I have a graphics file viewer called
Xnview, and I can view all my fvwm and gnome icons. 
When I view them via Xnview the fvwm and gnome icons
are indeed displayed with a black background but when
placed on the button bar only the fvwm icons show up
as they are supposed to.  

Why does this only happen with gnome icons?  They're
both in xpm format.

Is there something I should add to my .fvwm2rc file?

I'm using fvwm 2.2.4

Thanks in advance!

-arielc

First, see the following answer (and the message in its followup link):

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0105/msg00238.html

This way you may have all buttons shown, regardless of application hints,
if you wish.

It seems that there is a logical error in your configuration. I.e. your
Iconify button is number 6, Maximize is number 4, but you have (I guess):

  ButtonStyle 2 MWMDecorMax  # instead of 4
  ButtonStyle 4 MWMDecorMin  # instead of 6

This may explain why you remain with Iconify button instead of Close one.
I hope you now have needed pointers to tune your config.

And finally, transient windows should be shown in WindowList like all
other windows. Do you have WindowListSkip for window names in question?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Original GNOME icons are png, not xpm. I think your converting program
replaced the transparent color with the black one.

You may open your xpm files in an editor and replace "black" or "#000000"
with "None" to restore transparency. Or use a more correct convertor like
GIMP to transform png to xpm. You should get color "None" in xpm.

Mikhael.

Did you do any changes to your X configuration recently?
It is likely that your X does not recognize the middle mouse button.

Well I used Xnview to convert gnome's png's to xpm's. 
I decided to use gimp and it does it perfectly fine.

Thanks all!

Bindings used by FvwmPager are not configurable as of now.
Normally you need 2 clicks, one to change viewport and one to focus.

something not obvious is happening.  it now works on one host which has a
real three button mouse, but is not on another that has to emulate three
button.  but the pseudo-mouse-2 is working on that host, as i can get the
appropriate menu in the root window.

Maybe X maps your middle button to number 4 not 2. xterm and emacs paste
using mouse button number 2 only. Start xev to see which (if at all)
ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events this button generates.

By default, all mouse buttons (say mouse button number 4) open menu
MenuFvwmRoot on the root. This binding and menu are built-in.

Mikhael.

Hi I'm using FVWM2 on linux (slackware),
having previously used FVWM 1x on a solaris machine.

Most of the things I can be bothered about, I have managed to
convert to version 2, but there was one thing that I really
liked but have not been able to find any equivalent in version 2.

The thing I liked was the StubbornIcons style.
When an icon was deiconified, the window appeared in the location
from which it was iconified. 
The default is for all icons to restore onto the current virtual page.

Does anyone know of a way
to get back the stubbornicon behavior in version 2?

Cheers
Tim

For some reason unknow to me that feature was removed a very long
time ago and never written again (which would be really trivial).
Currently, you can't have this behaviour.  Something similar is
possible with FvwmIconMan.  Configure it to show all windows on
all pages and use it to (de)iconify windows.  In this case,
windows stay on their page.

I had
Style "*" MWMFunctions
Style "*" HintOverride
Style "*" MWMDecor
in my .fvwm2rc, but no MWMDecorMin, MWMDecorMax etc. assigned to buttons.
So Fvwm fell back to its defaults.

When I added the two lines above (and also ButtonStyle 1 - MwmDecorMenu),
I got no buttons whatsoever on the right side of those windows, only
button 1 was still there. I added the line

ButtonStyle 2 - Clear

and the close button appeared. Seems as if Fvwm kept the default flag for
button 2.

I guess the assumption that these windows are transients was an error on
my side. I was misled by the fact that they actually don't show a title
bar, if my .fvwm2rc lacks a 'DecorateTransients'.
I don't have a 'WindowListSkip' for these windows, this behavior seems to
be based on a different mechanism. No problem, it is ok that way.

By the way, this program has an excellent support.
Thanks again for the help!

I recently moved from fvwm 2.2.4 to 2.4.0.  I use the clock program
"oclock" with the transparent option, and noticed with fvwm 2.4.0 it
doesn't update the background behind the clock.  The clock hands smear as
they advance.  Since I've tried 2.4.0 on both Solaris and FreeBSD with the
same result, my guess is I'm missing something in fvwm's config file.

Any help appreciated,
Steve.

I can't reproduce that.

I tried with Solaris 8 and no special X-Resources.
I'm using an Exceed server right now though.

What command line/X-Resources are you using?

I see backing-store is slightly different on Exceed:

xdpyinfo | grep backing:
  options:    backing-store WHEN MAPPED, save-unders YES
vs. Solaris:
  options:    backing-store YES, save-unders YES

You might want to try oclock's "-backing" argument with some variations.
Let us know what happens.

Not yet.

Please respond to the list, not the person that answers.

I tried those resources and config file settings and
still couldn't reproduce the problem.

Perhaps someone else on the list has an idea.

Please run oclock without FVWM to see whether the problem is in oclock or
in X. You may do this in several ways, for example, while in FVWM execute
"Restart xterm" from FvwmTalk or FvwmConsole. Then start oclock in xterm.
To return to FVWM, type "fvwm2" in xterm.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Its quite a bit different being based on tiling rather than frame
sharing.  I'm interested in increasing data density on my screens --
thus the interest in TAB support.

I used the FreeBSD fvwm2 package instead, which includes:

Support for features:
        readline: yes
        rplay: no
        stroke: no
        xpm: yes
        gnome-wm (window manager hints): no
        sm (session management): yes
        gtk (FvwmGtk): yes
        gdk-imlib (in FvwmGtk): yes
        gnome-libs (in FvwmGtk): no
        multibyte: no

And oclock works correctly.

Thanks for the help,
Steve

First, I forgot to mention before that I'm not on the list.  Please cc all
replies to my email address.

In my .xinitrc file I replaced "exec fvwm2" with "exec xterm".  I ran an
oclock from within that xterm and it functions properly.

As for my fvwm2, I compiled it very minimally (if that makes a difference).
Here's the "fvwm-config -info" output:

Hi I use fvwm2 2.0.45, I would like new windows be added at the end of
WindowList so that it doesnt change the indices of other windows.  Is 
there any option that I can specify?

Thanks

You can't fixate the window indeces as of now. If you don't like that
windows in WindowList are in random positions, you may sort it:

  WindowList Alphabetic NoDeskSort

If you search for a way to switch between windows quickly you can do this
without WindowList. Please upgrade your fvwm, 2.0.45 is unsupported.

Here are commands for 2.4.0 that I wrote on the fly, to create shortcuts
for quick window switching. You press Shift-Ctrl-Alt-{1,2,3,4} to create a
numbered shortcut for the current window. Then press Ctrl-Alt-{1,2,3,4} to
switch to a numbered window:

  Key 1 W SCM Key 1 A CM Silent WindowListFunc $$w
  Key 2 W SCM Key 2 A CM Silent WindowListFunc $$w
  Key 3 W SCM Key 3 A CM Silent WindowListFunc $$w
  Key 4 W SCM Key 4 A CM Silent WindowListFunc $$w

WindowListFunc is built-in, but you may use other function for switching.
Silent is optional, it helps if the previously numbered window is closed.

Does it help?

Regards,
Mikhael.

So, you claim this is indeed an FVWM problem. I am clueless.

Yes, it's minimal, but I can't think that the features above are related.

In the current snapshots "fvwm-config --info" also reports about:
	shape (shaped windows): yes/no

It would be interesting to know whether you compiled with or without X
shape extension. You may execute "grep SHAPE config.h" to determine this.

Please also play with these style options to see whether they matter:

  Style oclock BackingStore, SaveUnder
  Style oclock BackingStoreOff, SaveUnderOff

I have no 2.0.45. Why can't you upgrade? :)
Actually 2.2.x versions should understand $w, $$w and WindowListFunc. Just
tested in 2.2.5, works very ugly as compared with the above, but works:

  AddToFunc MakeShortcut
  + I Key $0 A CM WindowListFunc $1
  + I Recapture

  Key 1 W SCM MakeShortcut 1 $$w
  Key 2 W SCM MakeShortcut 2 $$w
  Key 3 W SCM MakeShortcut 3 $$w
  Key 4 W SCM MakeShortcut 4 $$w

  #Recapture  # if you do all this in FvwmConsole, Key requires Recapture

You may use WindowList with window name arguments to bring only xterms or
only netscapes. Or as I wrote, try to solve this without WindowList.
For example, Ctrl-Alt-1 switches to (any) xterm, Ctrl-Alt-2 to Netscape,
Ctrl-Alt-3 to emacs:

  Key 1 A CM Next ("XTerm") Focus
  Key 2 A CM Next ("Netscape") Focus
  Key 3 A CM Next ("Emacs") Focus

P.S. Please reply to the list.

Mikhael.

I'd like to know from you experts if FVWM95 is suited for simple VGA screens. Unlike KDE and WM. And if so, where would I find a config file that sets up a nice GUI in simple VGA/256 colours?

This is the FVWM list. FVWM95 is something else, a clone of FVWM
from many years ago. FVWM95 doesn't appear to have been updated
since then.

On the other hand, changes and improvements are made to FVWM
almost every day.  (One was just committed as I typed this.)

The few things that set FVWM95 apart from FVWM were eliminated
years ago.  FVWM can now do everything FVWM95 does and more.

To get back to VGA screens, I run FVWM on a 256 color screen
and I'm very happy with FVWM.  Most useful is the FVWM feature
that limits the colors used in icons and pixmaps to a subset of
commonly used colors.  Running out of colors on a 256 color display
is a constant problem.  FVWM does its part to avoid that.

As to setting up the GUI, the easiest thing to do is just start up
FVWM without any config file at all.  Click on the root window
and go from there.  If you like the FVWM95 appearance, thats one
of your choices.

Please download the recent version and let us know what you think,
I think you'll be happy.

Possible bug:

(maybe i just configured something wrong)

F1 and F2 do what F11 and F12 were bound too, irrespective of their own
bindings. F11 and F12 work as expected. I know the keymaps are ok because
I had ctwm doing the exact same config earlier today, so i know hitting
F1 really is sending and F1.

Here are all of my Key definitions:

Key F1 A N Iconify
Key F2 A N Maximize 0 100
Key F3 A N Maximize 100 100
Key F4 A N Close

Key F5 A N Function "terminal"
Key F6 A N Function "browser"

Key F10 A N All [!iconic !sticky !FvwmTaskBar] iconify
Key F11 A N Restart
Key F12 A N Quit

Key Pause A N Function "lock"

Key space A M Popup "client options" Interior 0 0
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c "Prev FlipFocus"

And the man page uses the following as an example:

Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot

So I think I have the syntax right.

My fvwm version is 2.4.0

Please cc me, as I am not on the list.

Thanks,
Brendan

Hi.

Im installing fvwm2.4.0 on Redhat 7.0 and get these errors.

  Have ReadLine support?             yes
  Have RPlay support in FvwmEvent?   yes
  Have Stroke support?               no: Can't find required libstroke
  Have XPM support?                  no: Can't find required libXpm
  Have GNOME Window Manager support? yes
  Have Session Management support?   no: Failed to detect libSM
  Have GTK support for FvwmGtk?      no: Failed to detect GTK, see
config.log
  Have Multibyte support?            no: This is the suggested default

I've tried to install libstroke (rpmfind)
Also installing XPM seemed to go well (have elf, Xfree86 develop (to run
the xmkmf -a), strange world)

I gave up on the rest libSM.
I have gtk+-1.2.8-7 on the machine.
Dont know about Multibyte support.

Any help out there?

My last question... I use the Xfree86 startup login window. How do I
disable that if I want to start in text-mode?

Thanks, nikolaj, copenhagen, denmark

install X development libraries, "xlibs-dev" package on Debian, should
be something like "xlibs-devel" on RH

Subject: FVWM: Strange behaviour of ClickToFocus and Java AWT...

Hi everybody,

I have noticed a strange behaviour of my java apps when working over =
FVWM,
maybe it is a little bit off-topic because has much to do with Java, =
but I
would like to know I somebody has noted this problem before and whether
theres a workaorund or something I am doing wrong... it looks like =
follows:

I have stablished ClickToFocus in my .fvwm2rc, whose content is this:
- BEGIN OF .FVWM2RC -
DeskTopSize 1x1

# Default Styles:
Style "*"           BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, notitle, nohandles
Style "*"           NoPPosition, ClickToFocus
GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntRaise

# Some simple default mouse bindings:
#   for the root window:
Mouse 1 R N -
Mouse 2 R N -
Mouse 3 R N -

# Initialization function
AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmEvent
+ "I" exec xsetroot -solid Black
- END OF .FVWM2RC -

ok... I launch also two apps from my InitFunction, one xterm and a java =
app,
but I doesn't seem to be relevant. The thing is that whenever I have
'native' apps, like two xterms, ClickToFocus works perfectly. But I my =
java
apps happens the following: if I have in the window of my java app one
JPanel (Swing) with several swing JComponents and one Panel (AWT) with =
AWT
Components I click on the swing components and start to write text...
everything works OK. But if I MOVE (not click) the mouse pointer to the =
AWT
panel, I cannot keep on editing, because my keystrokes are lost. The =
other
way seems to work OK: I can click one AWT Component to set the focus =
and
type-in my text, it doesn't matter if I move the mouse pointer to the =
swing
JPanel (as far as I don't click on it)... I can keep on editing in my =
AWT
Component.

Once again, I think I has something to do with the way the JVM treats =
the
AWT Components (everyone has a native window as peer, I think)... but =
maybe
somebody has come through this problem yet, and has found any =
workaround...
It would be great.

Thanks in advance and best regards,

Miguel =C1ngel Ripalda

maripalda@elasa.siemens.es

P.S. I have tried over my linux box with RedHat 7.0 and FWVM 2.2.4 with =
Java
IBM JDK 1.1.8 and 1.3... and will try now with the blackdown port of =
JDK
1.1.8.

I remember having similar problems with another machine:

  % xmodmap -display -pk | grep '(F1[12])'
     95         0xffc8 (F11)
     96         0xffc9 (F12)

  % xmodmap -display starlight:0 -pk | grep '(F1[12])'
     67         0xffbe (F1)     0xffc8 (F11)
     68         0xffbf (F2)     0xffc9 (F12)
     95         0xffc8 (F11)
     96         0xffc9 (F12)

Unlike CTWM (I only guess about it), FVWM has a logic to bind the binding

  Key F11 A N Restart

to all keycodes (67 and 95) that this keysym (F11) is assigned to.

To fix this I would execute in ~/.xinirc:

  % xmodmap -e 'keycode 67 = F1' -e 'keycode 68 = F2'

Or maybe just change the order of your "Key F1" and "Key F11" lines? :)

Mikhael.

This are not really errors, the errors are when you run "make".
The symptoms are that you don't have XFree86-devel rpm installed.

libSM.a is shipped with XFree86-devel.

If you normally don't build anything yourself I suggest you to install
rpm, so you don't need all developement libraries and headers:

Try line "id:3:initdefault:" in /etc/inittab.

Thanks alot for that suggestion Mike. It works to switch the order
of the "Key" declarations, but it took me a little bit to straighten
out in my head exactly why. So I am posting the comment i added to
that section of my .fvwm2rc file, which explains explicitly why this
works.

# Note: why F11 and F12 *must* be bound before F1 and F2
#
# $ xmodmap -pk | grep '(F1[12])'
#      67         0xffbe (F1)     0xffc8 (F11)
#      68         0xffbf (F2)     0xffc9 (F12)
#      95         0xffc8 (F11)
#      96         0xffc9 (F12)
#
# The above output is one reason why FVWM might think that a binding
# to key 'F11' should become active when either a keycode 67 or a keycode
# 95 is received. The fact that (apparently) FVWM does not allow two
# events to be bound to one keycode allows us to fix the situation by
# placing the definitions for keys F11 and F12 before those of F1 and F2.
# Thus, when F1 is bound, it "steals" the keycode 67 association from
# F11, which previously was in possession of it.

First of all: these are *not* error messages.  This is simply a
summary of the features that will be compiled into fvwm and the
reasons why some will not.  You should still be able to compile
fvwm.

Some older versions of libstroke did not install themselves
properly.  There should be a file stroke.h in /usr/include or
/usr/local/include ore some other include directory.  If not, you
have to copy it there manually.  You can skip this if you do not
need stroke support.

>   Have XPM support?                  no: Can't find required libXpm

For some reason, configure could not find out where the xpm
library was installed.  There should be some hint what went wrong
in the config.log file.  If you can't figure it out with that
information, post the config.log file to the mailing list and
we'll try to help you.

>   Have GNOME Window Manager support? yes
>   Have Session Management support?   no: Failed to detect libSM

Probably the library is not installed.  Most people do not need
this anyway.

>   Have GTK support for FvwmGtk?      no: Failed to detect GTK, see
> config.log

You need this only if you plan to use the FvwmGtk module.

>   Have Multibyte support?            no: This is the suggested default

This feature has to be enabled explicitly with

  $ ./configure --enable-multibyte
 
> My last question... I use the Xfree86 startup login window. How do I

Since I have a SuSE system, the following information may not be
100% accurate for RedHat:

The decision between graphical/text mode boot is made in the file
/etc/inittab.  You should find an entries similar to this one in
there:

  # default runlevel
  id:5:initdefault:
  # runlevel 2  is  Local multiuser without remote network (e.g. NFS)
  # runlevel 3  is  Full multiuser with network
  # runlevel 5  is  Full multiuser with network and xdm

The initdefault level of 5 specified that the system uses
graphical boot.  Change this to 3 and the system starts with a
text console:

  id:3:initdefault:

It should be possible to do this somewhere in RedHat's config
tool too.

Ah, you said you have a Red-Hat system.  An equivalent rpm package
should have come with your system.  Just install it from your CD.

That's because Shift-F1 is the same as F11.  It is not possible to
always do the right thing with key bindings automatically.  Your
xmodmap (X keyboard mapping table) probably looks like this:

 key code       key symbol      key symbol (with shift)
 ------------------------------------------------------  
     67         0xffbe (F1)     0xffc8 (F11)    
     95         0xffc8 (F11)    

The F11 key generates the key code 95 while the F1 key generates
key code 67.  With no modifiers pressed, this is interpreted as
the key name "F11" or "F1".  But if the F1 key is pressed together
with shift, it generates "F11" too.  Therefore the code in fvwm
treats the F1 key as if it were labeled F11 in this case.
Sometimes this is a good idea (namely on the numeric key pad) and
sometimes it isn't (in your case).  I have written a patch that
will be part of the upcoming 2.4.1 release.  It deals with the
given situation, but can only handle the shift and caps-lock
modifier keys.

A simple workaround is to swap the order of the Key commands in
your config file.  With

  Key F11 A N Restart
  Key F1 A N Iconify

The F1 key overrides the binding created by the F11 key, so that
both keys should work as expected.

As suggested in some other posting, you have compiled fvwm without
shape support

  $ ./configure --disable-shape

Thus, fvwm does not do anything abot shaped window which is also
the reason why you need

> Style "oclock" BorderWidth 0,StaysOnTop
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Otherwise, a border would be drawn.  Since fvwm doe not use shape
masks, the transparent background of the window is never drawn.
Try to move the oclock window:  there is no transparency, the
backgorund just moves with the window.  To make it work, don't
use --disable-shape.

Thanks, that worked.  I recompiled a minimal fvwm2 but included shape
support and oclock works as expected.

Okay, I'll wait with the "configure error" (libstroke, xdm (looked at
the config.log), Gtk) and take one thing at the time.

You say I need to install XFree86 devel, so I installed (from
rpmfind.net):

  XFree86-devel-4.0.1-1.i386.rpm


This is what I get from rpm -q -a:

Xaw3d-1.5-7
Xconfigurator-4.4.3-1
XFree86-100dpi-fonts-4.0.1-1
XFree86-4.0.1-1
XFree86-75dpi-fonts-4.0.1-1
XFree86-devel-4.0.1-1
XFree86-ISO8859-2-100dpi-fonts-1.0-12
XFree86-ISO8859-2-1.0-12
XFree86-ISO8859-2-75dpi-fonts-4.0.1-1
XFree86-ISO8859-2-Type1-fonts-1.0-12
XFree86-libs-4.0.1-1
XFree86-SVGA-3.3.6-33

XFree86-xdm-4.0.1-1
XFree86-xf86cfg-4.0.1-1
XFree86-xfs-4.0.1-1

, and wait, I just try to make a configure and make to get some fresh
logs....


This is from make:

, its the same, didn't find the "develop" packes. Where did you download
it, as said, I got from rpmfind.net.

Thanks. nikolaj, copenhagen, denmark.

PS should I upgrade XFree86?

After installing X developement libs (or any other lib that you want to be
automatically found) you should run "ldconfig" as root.
There is a solution without running ldconfig by giving parameters to
configure, but you'd better just run "ldconfig".
I hope, you have /usr/X11R6/lib line in your /etc/ld.so.conf.
Then rerun "./configure; make".

You don't need.

Ok, I just tried the "ldconfig" command as root. It was running ok.
Also, my ld.so.conf has

/usr/X11R6/lib
/usr/kerberos/lib
/usr/lib


Afterwards I run ./configure and make (both as user and root). I get the 
same error - can't find -lXext.

./configure can't find your X developement libraries.

Don't proceed with make until you have SM support and optionally XPM
support from ./configure (that means your X libs are found ok).

Execute:
  rm config.cache
  ./configure
  make clean  # not really needed, but anyway

If this does not help, execute:
  ./configure --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib

If this does not help, send the output of:
  ls -l `rpm -ql XFree86-devel | grep libXext`

Good luck.

Regards,
Mikhael.

To Mikhael & Dominik:

Ok, if you were a girl, and you were here, I would give you a kiss *s* -
make is working, thanks!

"rm config.cache" did the trick (after ldconfig).

Also I made libstroke work too - SM also works because of the above and 
XFree dev..

So, I want to test before removing the old fvwm2. Iv'e tried to startup 
in consol mode and use "startx path/fvwm2" but it just starts up the old 
fvwm2, maybe because it uses the old system.fvwm2rc (redhat). By the way 
initd:3 is working (i forgot about Crtl+Alt+backspace).

Also, I would like to make configure find the GTK. As said, I have Gtk+ 
on the machine. Maybe I should install Gtk? (looked at their homepage, 
but couldn't find it, there's only Gtk+).

Ok, thanks. Im finally close to the installation!

Ok, its working now. Don't have to reply on my last question (how to
make the test).

Last question for today *s*

What is the default fvwm2rc file - liked the brush metal style in the
caption bar. It gone because I had to try the Setup Form (now I have
this other default red caption bar and the pager in the bottom). Anyway
Im going to try the themes now. Thanks for you help, guys. /nikolaj,

Hmm, didn't see that before now - themes only work with the rpm install
of Fvwm2.
Is there a workaround of that? I hope so. /nikolaj

Why was this changed in the first place? I am
using FVWM 2.2.4 and the pager with only one
click to change viewport and focus. I like it
that way.

  related question (or is it the same one?):

  I see that new fvwm 2.4 is already packaged in debian, can we expect
themese to be packaged as .deb (external or as part of debian)?

  IMO themes are very useful becuase they make it easy to change only
parts of config - e.g. I can have my own keyboard shortcuts (that I tend
to customize most and change rarely) and the visuals (that I customize
less (I don't care that muich about exact look) but would like to change
more often - to try out what other people have etc...)

  run fvwm and see what it tells you.

  you don't have to change your default config, just run another X
server (with no WM) or run vnc server or something like that (X nested -
can that e used?)

i have no fvwm executable.  i do have fvwm2, and it does not put anything
to stderr or stdout.  and i can't believe my config is error-free.

One of the themes developers will eventually provide a comprehensive
answer.  In the mean time, my experience with the themes package
is that RPMs are not required.

Most, but not all, of the fvwm commands produce errors on stderr
when there are syntax problems.  The idea behind this is that this
is a window manager, not an accounting package.

To force an error, try the Style command with the iconbox argument.
There are lots of error checks there.  For example:

Style xxx Iconbox junk

produces this error:

[FVWM][CMD_Style]: <<ERROR>> IconBox requires 4 numbers or geometry! Invalid string <junk>.

Where you see that error depends on how Fvwm is started.
I start fvwm using Exceed like this:

nohup fvwm2

so I see the error in $HOME/nohup.out

When on a Solaris machine, I start my X Server like this:

   xinit -- $MONO -nobanner -ar1 200 -ar2 20 2>&1 | tee /tmp/$USER/xinit.out

So I see the errors on my console app and in the file /tmp/$USER/xinit.out

If you still don't know where your errors are going, indicate the
OS/distribution you are using.

I think I know where Eric is coming from with VNC or Xnest, but you
don't have to go to this extreme, see my other post.

Mouse bindings used in FvwmPager in 2.4.0 are equivalent to ones in 2.2.x.
In both versions you need one click (button 2) to focus a window and another
click (any button, but they work differently) to change viewport.

Please reread the original message in this thread.

Eventually we will move to a more recent autoconf version that does not
use caching in configure by default.

  ok, whatever the name is called, sometime the version 2.x is called
fvwm2. Dan already posted how to produce error...

  if you want to do some more dangerous config tricks and do not want to
do it in the 'live' environment it is usefull to open another X server
and run another fvwm there, that way your environment is untouched.

  easy way (on linux):

  start new X server:

  X :1

  it is probably on vt8 (ctrl-alt-F8), or whatever first free virtual
terminal is. Now switch back to where you started X server (ctrl-alt-Fn
(one of the functions keys) and type:

  ctrl-z (to put X server to background)
  bg     (so that it actually runs in background)
  xterm -display 1

  and switch back to X server, you will see xterm (no window
decorations), move mouse to xterm, or even click on it (it should have
focus) and run fvwm2 from there, you should see all the messages right
on the screen and fvwm2 should start to manage the display.

  to kill X server hit ctrl-alt-backspace (if you had X server running
before it is still running, probably on ctrl-alt-F7)

  of course, you can use some other file instead of default config file
(again, so that you do not break your normal working environment), just
use -f command line option.

  hope this helps. It's probably overkill in your situation though...

Same for me. I used the .tar.gz sources and followed the INSTALL /
README docs. At a first glance everything works fine. The "rest" of
the Linux box is rpm-based (SuSE 7.1)

I think, Alexander Kotelnikov is a more adequate man to respond, but he
seems to only reply in threads about RedHat. :-)  [joke]

The author of this packaging proposal did not respond to me as well:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&bug=79428

I think, the same man (or group) should package both fvwm and fvwm-themes,
otherwise small inconsistences or non-synchronizations are possible.

I would prefer not to deal with deb packages since I can't test them,
but if there is a demand and the fvwm packager can't package fvwm-themes,
we may do the same automatical deb packaging as we have with rpm in
both projects. This will lead to 2 fvwm deb packages, one is a clean
package built by "make deb-dist" and another is the existing one.
Similar to what was done here: http://dove.net.au/~awol/fvwm/debian/ .
I would wait for other solutions before entering this situation.

BTW, the current fvwm-themes from cvs supports the Debian / Mandrake
update_menus (if detected) with several user choices.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Does choosing the FVWM95 appearance this way enable the "Redmond98" theme?

The "Redmond98" theme is something you get from the Fvwm Themes package.
The appearance is similar, but I don't think its the same.

Hi Guys!

I am currently writing a small neat FvwmScript which offers a dialog to
open an URL. It works fine til now, but I want MORE! *g*

It has three widgeds: A TextField and two PushButtons (OpenURL and
Cancel). Now, as I prefer using my Keyboard, I would like to open my URL
without pressing the OpenURL button, but by hitting the Enter key.

In the manpage, I found 'SendSignal' which I would like to use to simply
send 'SingleClic' to my PushButton. But HOW do I get the Enter key
signal? Unfortunately, there's no description of the signals at all in
the Manpage.

Thank you for a hint.

CU

Andre

Hello everybody,

   description of MinOverlapPlacement style says that this style tries 
very hard to avoid overlapping icons and windows on higher levels.

I have a problem - when I create new Mozilla window it is placed so that 
it is overlapped by FvwmTaskBar. I assigned MinOverlapPlacement to 
mozilla style:

Style mozilla-bin MinOverlapPlacement

but the behaviour of Mozilla windows was not changed.
I also tried to explicitely assign window position:

Style mozilla-bin MinOverlapPlacement

New windows are created in the same cascading style.


Please, give me a hint in which direction to move. Do I miss something 
simple?

Thank you in advance,
Andriy Palamarchuk

It seems to work now - the task bar does not overlap the window.

Thanks,

Hello!

I'm sorry this is extrememly off-topic.
Is there anyone on this list who has an @aol.com adress?
I suspect emails I send to such adresses are dropped (without notice)
So if someone has one, I would appreciate if I could try to send a
message, because I know through this list I would get confirmed.
I'm sorry but I don't know what else to do. I really need to know if it
works or I'll loose sleep :(

Thanks in advance, Marcus

I've seen the question asked before, but didn't find an answer in the
list archive.  Is there any way, in fvwm 2.4.0, to stop Mozilla
opening its transients (e.g. search and open web location) at 0,0?
(Some gnome transients do the same.)

I've tried "NoPPosition" and various long-shot options like
DecorateTransients, ActivePlacement for all windows, etc., but haven't
yet found anything that stops this annoying behavior.

Allin Cottrell.

What is the best way to programmatically detect that fvwm2
is the running window manger?

Can it be dectected by the use of  X properties?  If so,
which ones uniquely identify fvwm2 and are not left
behind by fvwm2 when its process dies?

Do these questions have anything to do with the open
FVWM/Java problems?

FVWM doesn't set any particular property to identify itself,
but we'd be willing to set one.

FVWM can already set a property that makes FVWM pass the
"XmIsMotifRunning" test.  Java doesn't seem to like that much.

According to my Solaris XChangeProperty man page:

     The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storing
     client.  Properties remain until explicitly deleted, until
     the window is destroyed, or until the server resets.

Hi,

I'd like to have the windows like right button styles:

1) I'm sure someone has created the 'vector' layouts yet.
   Where can I find them ?
2) Is there a means to modify the maximize button (like in windows)
   to show, if a window is maximized or not ?

related: Is there a function to remove title, border, handles ...
if a window is maximized ?

Help me to find a solution. 

This was a bug in 2.4.  The fixed will be released soon with the
upcoming 2.4.1.

You can't do this with FvwmTaskBar.

A similar appearance and functionality is provided by FvwmButtons that:
  * swallows FvwmIconMan, it is an alternative to FvwmTaskBar
  * contains a button to start xclock
  * or even swallows xclock itself
  * optionally contains more buttons with text/image or swallowed apps

Take a look at man pages of the mentioned modules and configure them.
There is no ready solution unless someone contributes you his own
FvwmButtons configuration that swallows FvwmIconMan. It's not very hard.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It is not possible to create Vector definition for this kind of buttons.
In the future Vector may support drawing using filled shapes, currently
only lines are supported.

It is easy to create the buttons that you want if you use ready images.
You may get images mini.winXX*.xpm from fvwm_images.tgz on fvwm.org.
fvwm-themes contains even more WinXX related button pixmaps.

>    to show, if a window is maximized or not ?

Yes, it's possible to use different buttons in normal and maximized states.

Now I see that samples system.fvwm2rc-sample-95 and DecorWin95 shipped
with fvwm-2.4.0 don't use this feature.

This is however used in fvwm-themes, take a look at buttons@redmond98:

  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/fvwm-themes/fvwm-themes/themes/redmond98/buttons?rev=1.8&content-type=text/plain

I hope you get an idea (use ButtonStyle instead of AddButtonStyle).

> related: Is there a function to remove title, border, handles ...
> if a window is maximized ?

This is not done on Maximize, but you may write needed functions yourself
and use them instead of Maximize. This is from bindings in fvwm-themes:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  + I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
  + I WindowId "$w" UpdateStyles
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
  + I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5

  # press Shift-Ctrl-F11 to maximize, Shift-Ctrl-F12 to unmaximize
  Key F11         A       SC      Pick FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
  Key F12         A       SC      Pick FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen

This does not work with fvwm-2.2.x versions. You should upgrade if needed.

Regards,

Hello,
I used to switch between desktops in fvwm using control-left and
control-right keys. Now, I started using fvwm2 (Version 2.2.4), and am
not able to do it. I guess I am not using the Desk command properly.
Here is my config - 2x2 Desktop.
And I want Control-Left Arrow to take me to the previous desktop.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Regards
GPN

almost perfect. Now I tried to map this to one key:

Key F11 A SC Pick FuncFvwmToggleFullScreen

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmToggleFullScreen
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmToggleFullScreen
+ I Current ( Maximized) FuncFvwmUnmaximizeFullScreen
+ I Current (!Maximized) FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen

unfortunately the first line minimizes the window (if it's maximized)
and the second line gets triggered also, because now the window is
certainly minimized. --> the window will stay maximized always.

What I'd need would be a 'else' function for conditionals.
Is this possible ? -- something like:

+ I Current (Maximized) ... else ...

Hi,

I tried gradients (Hgradient) in title bars, but even if I specify
1000 steps, it's not smooth. I'm on a 16 bit TrueColor visual where
I get perfectly smooth gradient colors when running Win2000 on vmware.
What can I do to get smooth title colors ?

  16 bit is not truecolor (24 bit color is referred to as truecolor, 16
is usually high color or something like that)

  it depends on how the palette is set up. Not sure how you can
influence that... you probably do not have anought colors or fvwm
decided to use fewer colors since you do not have unlimited number of
colors (where 24 bit is unlimited in this sense:-)

On a 16 bit display, the smoothness of the gradient depends almost
entirely on the colours you chose.  The 16 bits allow for only
five bits per base colour = 32 shades per base colour.  So,
gradients generally use no more than 32 different colours, but it
can be even much less if the starting and the end colour are too
close.  For example:

  1000 steps from #000000 (black) to #ff0000 (bright red) uses
  32 colours:

--> #000000, #080000, #100000, ..., #f70000, #ff0000

  but 1000 steps from #604000 to #406000 uses only five colours:

--> #604000, #584800, #505000, #485800, #406000

while you will harly note the steps of the first gradient, the
second one consists of only five big blocks of the same colour.

Bye

I am ruuning FVWM2 version 2.4.0 on Slackware 8. I have started the GNOME
panel in FVWM. One of the features of the panel is that it has a menu style
tool bar along with the large panel bar at the bottom of the screen. The menu
style bar (I don't know what it is called) at the top is positioned a little
low on the physical screen. How do I move this mene style bar to the top of the
screen? I have attached a screen shot of the desktop to help you understand
what I am trying to explain.

Thank you in advance for any help.

I guess that's a question for the GNOME developers.

I got this one straightened out. After I restarted the system, the top menu
bar at the top of the physical screen.

Another question related to FVWM + GNOME is, how to execute the FVWM "Quit"
function from the GNOME Panel ("Log Out")?

This is a gnome issue, not an fvwm one.  Right-click on the panel and
go to panel, properties, type.  If it's not an "edge panel", make it
one or alternatively if it's a "floating panel" go to "All properties"
and adjust its geometry.

I am opted to use GNOME session to manage the FVWM. I followed the instructions
in FVWM FAQ. My window settings are read from the .fvwm/.fvwm2rc but some of the
features are missing, such as "AutoRaise". My FVWM menus does show up fine.

One other feature is the FvwmPager. It does show up as a miniscule icon on
the panel bar. I can go to the FVWM Menu and call "Module FvwmPager" and it
does show up with the defined (prefered) geometry on the desktop.

How do I get these last 2 features to work in Gnome-session?

Fvwm commands can be issued via the command line.  To do this,
make sure the FvwmCommandS module is started, e.g. from the
StartFunction:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmCommandS

After that, fvwm commands can be issues from a shell:

  $ FvwmCommand "Quit"

Or if you know the process id, simply send it the QUIT signal:

  $ kill -QUIT <fvwm's process id>

or

  $ pkill -QUIT fvwm2

or

  $ killall -QUIT fvwm2

FvwmCommand does this when it can't communicate with
FvwmCommandS.

using "ps" check to see if FvwmCommandS is running.
Look for errors coming from fvwm.

Did you restart fvwm after you added FvwmCommandS to your .fvwm2rc?

Thank you for replying.

This is a bit strange. FvwmCommandS does not get listed in the process list.

AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+                           "I" Module FvwmAuto 500
+                           "I" Module FvwmCommandS

AddToFunc "RestartFunction"
+                           "I" Module FvwmAuto 500
+                           "I" Module FvwmCommandS

In fact FvwmAuto is not running either. I followed the instruction in FVWM FAQ
(section 2.7) to run fvwm via a Gnome session. The only thing that is showing
up now is my fvwm menus defined in ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.

The display manager I am using is GDM. (Don't know if this info will help).
What is the bestway to trouble shoot GNOME and FVWM integration? The fvwm2
version is 2.4.0

I don't run Gnome but the FAQ (and Dominik above) suggest that you use
StartFunction.  If you are running gnome-session, that would explain
why the modules aren't starting.

Currently cou can't do anything about it.  Fvwm always honours the
position that a transient window (like said mozilla windows) asks
for, and if it asks for 0 0 it will appear there.  This has
bothered me too for a long time, so I just wrote a patch:

 - Transient windows are placed like all other windows if neither
   the PPosition nor the USPosition hint is set.  In other words:
   The mozilla windows are placed at a sensible place on the
   screen.
 - New style options

     NoUSPosition/UseUSPosition
     NoTransientPPosition/UseTransientPPosition
     NoTransientUSPosition/UseTransientUSPosition

The patch will be included in the upcoming 2.4.1 release, or - if
you can't wait a second longer - in tomorrow's daily snapshot.
