The problem I'm experiencing is with using FvwmPager to switch desktop
views.  I'll button1 click on Pager to switch, move the mouse to where
the window I want will be drawn, watch the window get drawn in, but
NOT get the focus despite having the mouse in it.  I have to move the
mouse out of the window and back in _once_ to get it to focus.  This
has happened with emacs, netscape, xterms, xv, and several other
clients.

This bug was definately introduced in 2.0.44.  I never saw before with
2.0.43.

I patched my FvwmButtons to have shaped icons (or put a background
pixmap behind the icons).

If you're interested I can clean it (it was made by me for me :) ),
and post it here.

Hello.   Someone reported a problem with FlipFocus, and naturally I was
concerned since I wrote FlipFocus.  I have attempted to duplicate the
reported error with no success.  Unless someone else is having the same
problem, I would surmise that there is something wrong with the setup
which is causing thier problem. (Sorry, I don't remember thier name and
I deleted the mail.)

I am not the one who originally mentioned the problem, but whoever it was
jogged my memory.  I noticed the problem once with two rxvts and a
Restart if I remember correctly.  I tried reproducing it today,
successfully like this:

(Two rxvt's up)

I select restart fvwm2 from the root menu and move the mouse ptr into one
rxvt (it happens to be raised over the other by 40% or so).  Buttons and
borders are stripped away and replaced of course.  When the borders are
back on the two rxvts my mouse ptr is in the window it was in before
Restart but it doesn't have focus; to get focus I have to touch a border
or window bar with mouse.

I believe this is what you're talking about ( I don't have the original
message either ).

FWIW I'm running 2.0.43 in Linux.

That is not what I'm talking about.  The problem was a problem which only
occured with 2.0.44 and 2.0.45.  It was that after a restart fvwm2 
FlipFocus would produce an error about not being able to find 
module FlipFocus.

well.. I think we're talking about the same thing... just to clarify, it'd
make the icons n' stuff look like they're sitting on the desktop instead
of in a module right? Well... the way you do it, does it add an option, or
is it a compile time define?

I think it'd be really usefull to alot of people, not just me :)

No, it's not a bug.  RTFM, particularly the section on EdgeResistance.

I have released FvwmIconMan 0.9.1. I rewrote damn near everything it seems, so
I think it's much more cool, but it probably has bugs lurking, although I
don't know of any, except for an extremely minor one I don't want to fix
today. I would really appreciate it if some people could take it for a test
drive.

Chuck: most likely you shouldn't put a copy in the fvwm dist. just yet.

Major changes:

1. I rewrote all the X code to make it as easy as I can to optimize away
   useless redrawing of various parts of the manager windows. I have not put
   in all of the optimizations yet, since I'm waiting to see how things
   settle. It should be more efficient than previous versions though already.

2. I changed how you specify the geometry. Instead of one geometry option,
   there are now two: buttongeometry specifies the geometry of each individual
   buttons in units of pixels, and managergeometry specifies the geometry of
   the whole window in units of buttons. With buttongeometry, you can now set
   the height of the buttons (which was previously just the font height + 4),
   and with managergeometry you can now have multiple columns, constrain the
   number of rows (in which case the manager window grows horizontally), or
   constrain the whole geometry (and then when you add windows, it just makes
   the buttons smaller and adds more columns). The syntax for this is
   optimally terse though, so read the manpage.

3. The manager windows can be shaped. Makes (2) look a lot better.

Hi all!!

   I have a little problem with the MiniIcon feature of fvwm. I have 

Buttonstyle 1 MiniIcon
Style "*" MiniIcon jf.xpm
Style "rxvt" MiniIcon jterm.xpm

   (and much more). The problem is: I thought (sp?) that windows without 
a MiniIcon Style explicitly specified will have the jf.xpm pixmap, but it
seems that on these "generic" windows the first button results simply 
in a solid buttons. 

   And... the "dot sticking cursor bug" is not resolved. I can reproduce 
it in fvwm 2.0.45, too. (Please refer to an old message from myself 
explaining how to reproduce it).

   Well, overall, fvwm 2.0.45 looks really good. 

   Bye,
	Romano

PD: I am no longer subscribed to fvwm mailing list because we have big
problems due to routing policies at our site, so I do not want to bore 
the list maintainer with a lot of bounced messages. Please Cc: to me 
any answer. Thanks!

there still is 'the timing bug' in module restarts:

fvwmbuttons needs time to unswallow its subwindows, or they're not mapped,
when the new FvwmButtons is started. 
If the new button bar cannot find a mapped clock, it starts a new one.
simple and difficult to handle.

I had exactly the same symptoms. I now use:

AddToFunc ExitFunction	"I"	KillModule FvwmButtons
+			"I"	FvwmBanner
+			"I"	Wait FvwmBanner

AddToFunc RestartFunction "I"	Module FvwmButtons
+			"I"	Module FvwmAuto 500
+			"I"	FvwmBanner
+			"I"	Wait FvwmBanner
+			"I"	Next [emacs] focus

the FvwmBanner / Wait FvwmBanner provides time for the old windows to be
mapped

how is SNICKERBOA defined ?

#define SNICKERBOA
just defines teh macro, but it has no value:
	#ifdef SNICKERBOA is evaluated
	#if SNICKERBOA isn't

#elif 
	is short for 
#else 
#if
...


so you should use 
#elif def(SNICKERBOA)
...
or 
#else
#ifdef SNICKERBOA
...
instead (with additional #endif)



the cause for -DSNICKERBOA working is:

     -Dmacro
          Define macro macro with the string `1' as  its  defini-
          tion.

     -Dmacro=defn
          Define macro macro as defn.    All instances of `-D' on
          the  command line are processed before any `-U' or `-i'
          options.

so it's not equivalent to #define SNICKERBOA
which has no value.

Hi... I'm trying to setup two different .fvwm2rc's (one for my personal
use and one as a semi-campus-wide default). I was wondering if there is
any way to specify within ANY .fvwm2rc that it's to be processed using
FvwmM4 instead of having to specify it on the command line. Sorta the way
Shell scripts have the #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/csh or whatever in order to
specify that it's a shell/cshell script. 
	If there's something in the man page I missed (it wasn't all that
informative), I think I read something about putting the word FvwmM4 at
the top of the file, but if you wanted the whole rc file to be processed
then it would have to be specified as a startup command option... I tried
every which way I could think of, but I had to stick to the -cmd "FvwmM4
.fvwm2rc" thing...
	I think this wouldbe a really usefull feature (specifying that the
entire file be processed with a module within the .fvwm2rc) for everyone.
It would definitely make distributing .fvwm2rc's alot easier (the user
wouldn't have to wonder each time he d/l's a new one). I don't know if
this is possible with FvwmCPP cuz I haven't had a chance to look at it
yet.
	In my situation, I want the system-wide .fvwm2rc to be processable
(due to the many different architecture machines with different
configurations that we have) even if it isn't explicitly told to process
on the command line. For my personal use, I wouldn't care (although it'd
make my .xsession look a whole lot prettier).

Did you use the 2.0.45 FvwmAuto ?
Try my latest update at <URL:http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~albrecht/fvwm2.html>
If you still have troubles with this version, tell me.

think so, too.
can't imagine how this could be happening.

add this to your .fvwm2rc:

Start FvwmAudio.

this will show you all events in fvwm2 stdout (written).
start fvwm2 from an xterm in foreground and watch the events, as you do the
above mouse movements again on an rxvt.

Also try with an xterm.

What's the difference?
Does rxvt generate additional focus events ?

don't think so.

that's another bug:

fvwm2 doesn't set the focus to the uppermost window on startup.

[could this be fixed, chuck ?]

add sth like 
+	"I"	next [xterm] focus
to StartUpFunction and RestartFunction as a workaround.

g> I am running 2.0.45 and find this doesn't work as advertised.

there still is 'the timing bug' in module restarts:

fvwmbuttons needs time to unswallow its subwindows, or they're not mapped,
when the new FvwmButtons is started. 
If the new button bar cannot find a mapped clock, it starts a new one.
simple and difficult to handle.

I had exactly the same symptoms. I now use:

AddToFunc ExitFunction	"I"	KillModule FvwmButtons
+			"I"	FvwmBanner
+			"I"	Wait FvwmBanner

the FvwmBanner / Wait FvwmBanner provides time for the old windows to be
mapped 

----->> i had the same thing in my ExitFunction, but ever since 2.0.44
(and including 2.0.45, where this is supposed to be fixed, i
thought...), the Wait hangs.  it kills the FvwmButtons, displays the
FvwmBanner, the FvwmBanner goes away, and then nothing happens.  period.
What really perplexes me, however, is that someone at my site is using a
.fvwm2rc based on mine, is using a copy of the same binary i'm using,
and it works for him.  i can send copies of both rc files, if anyone's
interested...

i'm running 2.0.45 on:
* DEC Ultrix 4.3
* Digital Unix (OSF/1) 3.2
* Irix 5.3

this problem occurs on all three platforms.  i tried making an rc with
just an exit function that looked like:

AddToFunc ExitFunction
+	I	Module FvwmBanner
+	I	Wait FvwmBanner

and a menu that restarted fvwm2, bound to mouse button 1 in the root
window.  i still got the hang.  any ideas?

I used to use 
Style "emacs@*.auto"	sth
Style "emacs@*.vlsivie"	sthelse

to assign different styles to emacses in different domains.

Now In 2.0.45 this doesn't work any more.
(I noticed, when fvwm didn't map any miniicon to the top left button,
until I changed the line to 

Style "emacs" MiniIcon mini.gnu.xpm

????

as far as I understood, the lockup came from a timing condition.
(grabbing the server too early / too late ?)
the bug was 'fixed' by moving around the XGrabServer() call.

Looks like you've got the fastest (/slowest) machine of us all ?

anyone knowing of a better fix ?

Version 0.9.2 is now on my web and ftp sites. Made exactly one change, which
fixes things on machines where realloc (NULL, ...) barfs. If you don't have a
problem (FvwmIconMan prints an error message if realloc fails), then you don't
need this version.

what do you think:

as it is FvwmAudio calls an external command via the C system() call.

should FvwmAudio call the fvwm-function audiofunc (changeable via cmdline) 
with the sound as parameter ?

examples:

	a) RPlay (still handled internally) call FvwmAudio this way:
		Module FvwmAudio builtin_rplay

	b) normal external play cmd
	   AddToFunc audiofunc "I" exec /usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay FvwmAudioDir/$1
		Module FvwmAudio
	   or 
		Module FvwmAudio audiofunc


	c) rsynth/say:
	   AddToFunc audiofunc "I" exec /rsynth/say $1

		Module FvwmAudio
	   or 
		Module FvwmAudio audiofunc
	   or
		Module FvwmAudio "exec /rsynth/say"

	d) echoing the parameters for debugging purposes is faster, 
	   using the fvwm internal echo rather than calling a shell:

		Module FvwmAudio echo


this somewhat reduces all the cryptic possibilities to two possibilities:

	builtin_rplay
	arbitrary fvwm function
		 which also takes care of FvwmAudioDir

net effect:
you can attach an arbitrary fvwm function to an fvwm event:


*FvwmAudio focus after_focus_hook
AddToFunction call_hook "I" $1
FvwmAudio call_hook

results in after_focus_hook being called after every focus.
(you might like to rearrange windows)

and lots of other possibilities...

the code size is the same, it just adds flexibility.

what do you think ?

Sorry about this, but the FvwmmIconMan 0.9.2 tar file I released had the wrong
Imakefile in it. According to the logs here, only one person got it before I
was able to replace the tar file, but whoever that is, they certainly won't be
able to compile it until they get the new one.

Yes, this is what I meant: it seem that it is not happening. If I open 
a window for which I have no Style specification (say, xchomp) it does not
inherit the miniicon from the * style. 2.0.45 on Linux Xfree 3.1.2.

No. :-) It's a bad interaction between AutoRaise and Fvwm, let me paste 
again the way to reproduce it:

   Run FvwmAuto 1500
   From the focused and raised xterm: run xcalc 
   Rapidly, choose from the first button windows menu of the calc
            the close option, in such a way that when the xcalc will 
            disappear, your mouse pointer is on the original xterm

If you have done this quite rapidly (before 1500 ms, I think, but I have 
not verified) the cursor is sticky to a big black dot and you have to 
click anywhere to be able to work again. 

Well, I am in a rush now, so if you like I will send you more info 
at lunch time. Thank you for your time,
					Romano

Hi Rob,
Nice one! Tried patching it in and although a couple of the parts of the
diff failed so I had to put them in by hand, it all compiled and linked
with no problems. So, now I have a rather nice looking pager full of
mini-icons. Although I now have the colours worked out to my
satisfaction (through good ole' trial and error!) how does your new
colour command and the previous interact?
Thanks,
Nick

--------------------------------------------------
       Dotfile Generator 2.0 Now Available
      ----------------------------------------------- 1997 Feb 5 ---


  This note is to announce the public relase of The Dotfile Generator
  version 2.0. Lots of changes have been made, since last version, which was
  released for more than a year ago.


What is the Dotfile Generator
-----------------------------
  The Dotfile Generator is a tool to help the end user configure basic
  things as well as exotic features of his or her favorite programs
  without knowing the syntax of the configuration files, or reading
  hundreds of pages in a manual. At the moment, The Dotfile Generator
  knows how to configure Bash, Fvwm1, Fvwm2, Tcsh, Emacs, Elm and Rtin.

A picture is worth a thousand words
-----------------------------------
  Please check out The Dotfile Generator's home page, where you will find
  screen dumps from the program and an article submitted to Linux Journal.
  http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/dotfile/

The Fvwm2 module (fvwm version 2.0.44 and 2.0.45)
-------------------------------------------------
  This module is without comparison the largest and most extended module
  for The Dotfile Generator. Included is are a few standard configurations,
  which you may start out with, and the capability of reading the original
  dotfile (except module settings).

The Bash module
---------------
  This module consists of 17 configuration pages, logically ordered in 
  two major groups, which makes it easier to find a specific option 
  (e.g. setting up shell prompt, command aliases, completion, error 
  handling and much more).

  If you are interested in further information about the Bash module, you
  are welcome to visit its homepage at http://www.imada.ou.dk/~pzacho/bash/

Other Modules
-------------
  The Dotfile Generator 2.0 is accompanied by a number of other
  modules besides the Bash and Fvwm module, namely:

  o tcsh module
    Configuration of Tcsh shell. Tcsh is a counterpart to Bash (they are
    both shells).

  o elm module
    the ELectronic Mailer.

  o emacs module
    Configuration of the emacs text editor.

  o rtin module
    Configuration of rtin - a USENET news reader.

  o fvwm1 module
    You should really convert to fvwm ver 2.0!

Where do I get it?
------------------
  You can get a FREE copy directly from our ftp site

  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/dotfile.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/dotfile.tar.Z

  or the NEOSOFT site:
  ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/sorted/misc/dotfile-2.0.tar.gz

Requirements
------------
  The Dotfile Generator requires Tcl/Tk, but don't let that scare you,
  Tcl/Tk compiles on almost every machine that runs X windows.

  You can find Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0 at

  ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.6.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tk4.2.tar.gz

  or for Linux users, there is a precompiled set for X11R6 at

  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/tcl74.tgz
  ftp://ftp.imada.ou.dk/pub/dotfile/tk40.tgz

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hello

I run Redhat V4.0 and am pretty sick of the fvwm95 - type interface. So I
got hold of several desktops designed during their recent competition (see
www.redhat.com - there are some nice ideas).  Most that I've tried work
well, however one particular design has given me a lot of trouble.  This
particular desktop uses fvwm2.0.43 or above (I've tried 2.0.43 and 2.0.45)
and the FvwmCpp C preprocessor.

However when I try to run X using startx (calling .Xclients) I get the
following error messages and FVWM refuses to start:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2
^?ELF^A^A^A

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2
.5

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwD^Dh*hU

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2
t^Ey

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwF^D^C

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 u

Now to me this looks like FVWM is reading in a binary file as list of
modules.  I've looked at several things, but nothing seems to solve the
problem.  I have noted that the problem persists even if I remove all the
entries for the preprocessing from .fvwm2rc, ie leave the file blank. This
seems to indicate that there is a problem with the preprocessor or a file
it calls.  The command used to initiate fvwm in .Xclients is 

exec fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp -debug $RCFILE" -display :0 \
                > $HOME/.FVWM2-errors 2>&1

I've even tried altering this, eg:

fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp .fvwm2rc" -display :0 \
                > $HOME/.FVWM2-errors 2>&1

The junk in the error messages looks suspiciously like the start of
FvwmCpp itself.

Any answers, or any hints?

%% Regarding FVWM: Wierdness with FvwmCpp; you wrote:

  lpw> fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp .fvwm2rc" -display :0 $HOME/.FVWM2-errors 2>&1

This is wrong.

  lpw> The junk in the error messages looks suspiciously like the start of

  lpw> Any answers, or any hints?

You're exactly right, it _is_ the start of FvwmCpp.

>From the fvwm2(1) man page:

     -f config_file
          Causes fvwm to Read config_file instead of ".fvwm2rc" as its ini-
          tialization file.  This is equivalent to -cmd "Read config_file".

So, you're giving fvwm2 a config file of "FvwmCpp", which is a binary.
Surprising that it finds it, actually :).  The right way to do this,
again from the fvwm2 man page, is:

  M4 PREPROCESSING
       M4 pre-processing is handled by a module in  fvwm-2.0.   To  get  more
       details,  try  man  FvwmM4.   In short, if you want fvwm to parse your
       files with m4, then replace the word  "Read"  with  "FvwmM4"  in  your
       .fvwm2rc file (if it appears at all), and start fvwm2 with the command

            fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"
------------------^^^^

  CPP PREPROCESSING
       Cpp is the C-language pre-processor.  fvwm-2.0 offers  cpp  processing
       which  mirrors  the  m4 pre-processing.  To find out about it, re-read
       the M4 section above, but replace "m4" with "cpp".

I have recently upgraded to 2.0.45, and gotten most all of my old look-and-feel
back. But one minor quirk of the old pager that I miss-- when I clicked mouse1
on an app window in the pager, it not only jumped to that quadrant, but it also
gave the focus to that window (I use ClickToFocus on my windows). I have not
found a way to re-create this behavior with the module FvwmPager. As a bonus,
I'd kind of like to have it use something other than "Desk 0" for the title--
I don't use virtual desks, just one 3x3 desktop.

Both of the new FvwmIconMan versions (v0.9.1 and v0.9.2) are seg
faulting when emacs switches to the minibuffer *if* I have the
following line in my .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmIconMan*2*dontshow   title=*Minibuf*

If I take it out, things seem to work fine.  I've enclosed the
FvwmIconMan section of my .fvwm2rc below.  I'm running 2.0.45 on an
AlphaStation 400 4/233 under DU 3.2g.  Any suggestions?

Ah, I found it. Silly mistake. A new release will be out shortly (not just for
this). Thanks to everybody who's putting up with this.

Hi, 
	I just found a little bug in TitleStyle... I've been playing with
my setup (a variation based on dummies-fvwm), and I ran accross the
following problem. If you wanna achieve something like:

TitleStyle ActiveUp Solid grey55 -- Sunk
TitleStyle ActiveDown Solid grey60 -- Sunk

The ActiveDown Sunk/Raised option has to be switched like so:

TitleStyle ActiveUp Solid grey55 -- Sunk
TitleStyle ActiveDown Solid grey60 -- Raised

I guess for ActiveDown, if you want Sunk, you have to put Raised, and vice
versa...

This is not a bug and is desired behaviour.  It is described here in a man
page excerpt: 

 There is an important note for the ActiveDown state.  When a button
 is pressed, the relief is inverted.  Because of this, to obtain a
 sunken  ActiveDown  state  you  must  specify  the  opposite of the
 desired relief (i.e. to obtain a pressed-in look which  is raised,
 specify Sunk for ActiveDown).  This behavior is consistent, but may
 seem confusing at first.

OK tireless beta-testers (the number of whom are probably dropping half each
new release), I've got 0.9.3 ready. I've got a good feeling about this one
(probably not worth much though). I fixed a lot of things this time.

I have been using Sun workstations for around 5 years now, and have
tried different window managers including ol(v)wm, (c)twm, and of
course fvwm.  Most of this time I have been using olvwm, and recently
have moved to fvwm v2.0.45 (a good move).

[ Some of you probably know all of this next paragraph already, so
  please bear with me ]

The problem I was hoping someone may be able to help with is to do
with the behaviour of OpenLook/XView child windows (transients in fvwm).
Under ol(v)wm, transients are "pinned", and are able to be dismissed
(closed) either by clicking on the pin graphic, or by using the "Open"
button on the (extended Sun) keyboard.  However, for non-transients,
the pin graphic is replaced by a button with a pull-down menu (window
controls), and the open button now toggles the window's iconified
state.

Being able to dismiss transient windows using the open key is very
nice, especially when using applications like FrameMaker which uses
them relatively frequently.

My question is:
Is it possible to bind keys and define title buttons to be different
for transient windows than for ordinary windows?  If not, could
this perhaps be added as a feature to the next version?

I have checked the manuals & docs and the only controls for
transient windows determine whether they are or aren't decorated
(DecorateTransient/NakedTransient).

Thanks in advance,

Justin

I have managed to build fvwm2 on HPUX 10.10. It seems to be acting
very well for me. However, I have a couple of questions. I
am unable to build FvwmAudio because I am missing the header
file rplay.h. I was wondering where I can get this header file
and what additional functionality does it provide? Do I need rplay.h?

Sincerely,

The SendToModule command in 2.0.45 has a bug. If fvwm executes the command:

SendToModule "FvwmIconMan" gotobutton Down, select

Then FvwmIconMan gets the string: '" gotobutton Down, select'. If fvwm
executes:

SendToModule FvwmIconMan gotobutton Down, select

Then FvwmIconMan gets the string: ' gotobutton Down, select'.

Fvwm certainly shouldn't be sending the trailing ". And, it probably would be
best to advance past any whitespace before sending.

Two major changes: fixed (hopefully) bug which caused the manager windows to 
teleport around the window when changing pages, and added branch instructions
to the list of commands you can run in actions. Can't do backwards jumps
though, so no loops. With these commands you should be able to navigate the
manager windows quite nicely without the mouse.

I saw this in 2.0.44 as well. 

I have the following:

DeskTopSize 2x2

Key KP_7        A       M       GotoPage 0 0
Key KP_9        A       M       GotoPage 1 0
Key KP_1        A       M       GotoPage 0 1
Key KP_3        A       M       GotoPage 1 1

So I use the meta key and my number pad to move around my 2x2 desktops. 
Now, after I quit netscape, none of these commands work, although these still
do:

Key Left	A	M	Scroll -100 0
Key Right	A	M	Scroll +100 +0
Key Up		A	M	Scroll +0   -100
Key Down	A	M	Scroll +0   +100

So, fvwm can still recognize actions bound to meta-something, and move the
page around, but GotoPage doesn't seem to work.

Once I change the current page, either with FvwmPager, or one of the Scroll
commands, then everything works fine again.

Hi!

It happens that I have to run some windows programs with WABI. WABI and
window managers with virtual desktops doesn't communicate to well. The
problem is that the windows that WABI controls will whow up on every
desktop.

Is it possible to tell fvwm, in one way or another, to handle the
WABI-windows like any other X applications?

Not that I'm aware of - this is something WABI does intentionally, and
it's not limited to fvwm...

Bummer, huh ?  This used to bug me too, back when I had a sun...

I  believe this has been  reported before.  For  me, this is the worst
bug remaining in fvwm2.

I see a slightly different  set of symptoms, NO key  works until I use
the mouse to do something.

So far I   have found  that both  gimp   and netscape can   cause this
behavior.

If there is a window under the gimp or netscape that the mouse pointer
falls into, you won't see   this problem.  You   only see it when  the
mouse pointer ends up on the root.  (I use mousefocus.)

On the testing I have done so far, if you watch a window's events with
xev, as it exits, most applications generate "unmapnotify", where gimp
and netscape don't.

Fvwm2 does do some processing on unmapnotify, but  I don't see what it
does that would cause this problem.

I have made some attempts to understand what is going on in fvwm2, but
so far  I am mystified.  If  someone could explain  to me how fvwm2 is
supposed to see keypress events when it  gives focus to other windows,
and what the "NoFocusWin" is, maybe I could make some progress.

Something must be possible as Sun's CDE window manager (dtwm?) can
isolate wabi to a given desktop.  I'm seriously considering installing
R6 and trying wabi under xnest.  I just haven't had time.

Here is the patch I made to put a background pixmap or a transparent
background on an FvwmButtons bar. Anybody has a better name? :)

The new option is FvwmButtonsPixmap. You can use 

*FvwmButtonsPixmap <your_pixmap.xpm>
to put a background pixmap, or

*FvwmButtonsPixmap none 
to make the FvwmButtons background transparent (as with enlightment).

You can check this URL to see a (small) screen shot.
http://www.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/~fortier/Fvwm/index.html

As I go on holidays, I won't reply to any mail until a week.
Happy Buttoning ;)

Lokh.

Does FvwmAuto work with fvwm95-2?  I can't seem to get it to autoraise
windows.

when you have the dot cursor, click on a lowered window.
it's raised, so the dot cursor is from a pending raise action.
Why is the action pending?

Because the windowid doesn't exist any more (window already closed).
(if the window id is invalid, raise waits for the user to click on a window)

But FvwmAuto can't easily test, if the window still exists (well it could
keep track of close/destroy/unmap events)

It's easier to pass on the test to Fvwm2, which knows, if the window still
exists. So FvwmAuto should probably use sth like:

	AddToFunc raise_if_exist "I" WindowId $0 raise
	FvwmAuto 1500 raise_if_exist

and give the function the windowid as parameter (like the windowlist does)

problem is:
	chuck rejected my idea of adding windowid parameter support to all
	functions which need a window (or let the user choose one), when I
	did the windowlist rewrite (which he in term rewrote afterwards)

	So to use the added parameter with raise or other builtin
	window-based functions, you'll always have to write a wrapper
	function. 

	Functions that do use a parameter (like Iconify) will misinterpret
	this parameter, so even if you don't use the argument, you'll have
	to write a wrapper that discads that argument for these.


I don't like this situation at all.
I also don't like the patch below very much, but at least it works.

To all:

   - Here is something nifty I am trying to accomplish:

   - In fvwm, I want to go through all logical screens of 
     the desktop, one at a time, sleeping 10 seconds in betwwen
     switching logical screens.  I also want to have this continuously
     running.
   - In summary, The window manager should constantly keep on switching 
     through all the logical screens, with a 10 second delay.

   - Can someone please guide me in making this work!!

All help would be greatly appreciated!!

[Patch for FvwmAuto]

well 
	AddToFunc raise_if_exist "I" WindowId $w raise
	FvwmAuto 1500 raise_if_exist

would have worked without the patch, since $w isn't expanded, if the
current windowid is invalid. And there is no WindowId "$w", so raise isn't
called.

how about a patch to introduce

*FvwmPagerMouse1Function fn1
*FvwmPagerMouse2Function fn2
*FvwmPagerMouse3Function fn3

AddToFunction fn1 "I"	windowid $0 focus
+		"I"	windowid $0 raise

hmmm, the JumpTo doesn't exist either.

We all know Santa as a fat, jolly old man. Well, he may be fat and he
may be old, but he ain't always jolly. There was this one year when
Mrs. Claus decided she wanted to be a feminist, the reindeer went on
strike, and the elves sued because they wanted to be called
"vertically challenged toy manufacturers".
So Santa retreated to his office to rest, when an angel entered and
said, "Santa..."
"What do you want?" was the reply.
"Well," the angel answered,"The Christmas Tree arrived today."
"So?" Santa said.
"Well, I was wondering where you wanted me to put it."
And that, my friends, is why Angels sit on top of trees.

no you don't need it.
If you 
	#define HasRPlay NO     /* YES */
in Fvwm.tmpl, FvwmAudio compiles without rplay support.

for the rplay sources, the man page says:
          rplay can be obtained via anonymous ftp at
               <URL:ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay>
          or   <URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/rplay>
I checked it last week.
It worked then.

sorry, i rewrote it somewhat.
but as far as Fvwm95-2 uses the same event masks (e.g for focus) and the
SendText/SendInfo interfce hasn't changed, it should.

the newest (1 hour old) FvwmAuto sends an additional parameter (hex
windowid), so this could break some things, but probably not the raise
functon.

sorry, I don't know fvwm95-2 in detail.

you could experiment with 

FvwmAuto 10000 nextpage
AddToFunc nextpage "I" next focus

which should cycle through all windows on all desks & pages.
Each time a window gets focus, it sets off a timer to focus on another
window after ten seconds.

as close as I could get.
(untested!)

Well, the bugs are getting less serious. That's good.
FvwmIconMan 0.9.5 is on my web and ftp sites. Hopefully I fixed a bug
where if you switched pages under relatively decent cpu load, the manager
window could change the button size. If this hasn't happened to you, there's
not much point in getting it.

If you have FvwmCommand working, a simple shell script like this will do
what you are looking for. You need to set FVWMLIB as your fvwm lib
directory and might need to use Desk command if you are using desks
instead of pages. 


Hope it helps.

How does flipfocus work?  I have

Key F1	RWTSFIA N       FlipFocus

but when I press it after visiting some windows, it does nothing but
give me an audio sound like my window closing sound.

I was wondering if anyone has enountered the problem of runaway GoodStuff
and FvwmWinList processes for Fvwm 1.24r on Solaris 2.5.1? The problem
that many of our users, including myself, experience is that when we log
out, fvwm quits but leaves GoodStuff and FvwmWinList processes behind to
gobble up CPU time.

This does not happen on our SunOS 4.1.3 machines, just Solaris.  From
searching the mailing list archives, I see no mention of anyone else
experiencing this which is quite curious.  Any suggestions on how one
might go about debugging this or things to try to eliminate the problem? 

Thanks...

In the FVWM faq, it says that your page size should be the same size as
your physical screen size.  But with my Linux box with cirrus 5434 and
infiniti monitor, the page size is 20% larger than the physical screen
size.  Anyone know how to change your page size FVWM95-2? 
	Any help would be much appreciated,

Hi everyone,

A little while ago, Rob Whapham (rwhapham@hublink.com) posted a patch to
let the FvwmPager of fvwm95 do mini-icons and the possibility to define
WindowColors used in the pager.

Now I've patched my FvwmPager from the fvwm-2.0.45 tree with this patch
(partly by hand) and made a diff that works with fvwm2. For all of you
who didn't want, or could, patch with the fvwm95 version of the patch,
here's the fvwm2 version, as an attachment to this mail.

To patch FvwmPager, go inside the FvwmPager dir
(fvwm-2.0.45/modules/FvwmPager) and type "patch -p0 <
the_location_and_name_of_the_patch_goes_here". Good luck! :)

And this is to Chuck. Can you take a look at the code and consider adding
this to fvwm2? I think this is a great addition, especially the
WindowColors part. Now with the new-and-enhanced border/titlestyle
options, I've got all my windows with a Grey75 background. FvwmPager
became a lot less handy, untill I run into this patch. So (on my knees):
Please, please add it to fvwm2... ;)

That's it and that's that. Mail you later.

Greetings,

Thimo Jansen

Hi again,

A few minutes ago, I posted a message concerning the FvwmPager patch and
not everything did go very well. My own mailreader (Mutt 0.61) didn't
even understand it's own PGP-signature and segfaults when I tried to view
the message. I don't know what all the other mailreaders thought about
it, but I'll try it again, this time without the PGP-sig. Hope you
forgive me for this abuse of bandwidth! :)

*** Original message follows ***

Hi everyone,

A little while ago, Rob Whapham (rwhapham@hublink.com) posted a patch to
let the FvwmPager of fvwm95 do mini-icons and the possibility to define
WindowColors used in the pager.

Now I've patched my FvwmPager from the fvwm-2.0.45 tree with this patch
(partly by hand) and made a diff that works with fvwm2. For all of you
who didn't want, or could, patch with the fvwm95 version of the patch,
here's the fvwm2 version, as an attachment to this mail.

To patch FvwmPager, go inside the FvwmPager dir
(fvwm-2.0.45/modules/FvwmPager) and type "patch -p0 <
the_location_and_name_of_the_patch_goes_here". Good luck! :)

And this is to Chuck. Can you take a look at the code and consider adding
this to fvwm2? I think this is a great addition, especially the
WindowColors part. Now with the new-and-enhanced border/titlestyle
options, I've got all my windows with a Grey75 background. FvwmPager
became a lot less handy, untill I run into this patch. So (on my knees):
Please, please add it to fvwm2... ;)

That's it and that's that. Mail you later.

Greetings,

Thimo Jansen

Using fvwm2, I'm trying to make a function that I can combine with the
fvwm buttons; however, when I attempt to start the function, my X server
locks up and I have to kill it.

I'd like to get my function to startup two things when the fvwm button is
pressed. I've used the AddToFunc call without any real success ..  Below,
I've posted what I am trying to do, but I was brief on the command options
used with xterm because I wanted to keep it readable. 

## declare the function
AddToFunc Name  "I" Exec rsh -l user localhost "exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm"
+               "I" Exec rsh -l user localhost "exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm"

##call it with the buttons
*FvwmButtons Name            none    Function Name

Does anyone see what I am doing wrong and/or how I can fix it? Thanks.

Subject: FVWM: FVWM menus in TkGoodstuff Buttons ?
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I have assigned a few buttons in my button bar to activate fvwm menus.  I
am thinking of replacing FvwmButtons with TkGoodstuff (any comments on that
idea?), and I am wondering if it is possible to do the same thing there.

OR, would it be possible to swallow the TkGoodstuff bar into the FvwmButtons
bar?

I am just trying to find the best way to get 1) the most functionallity,
2) the greatest available screen real-estate, and 3) the smallest impact on
the host computer -- all at the same time.

Sounds like a wise move to me.  Tkgoodstuff can auto-minimize for
real-estate.  And, modesty aside, it's *way* functional.  But like all
tcl/tk stuff it's memory-hungry.

No need to use FvwmButtons.  To bind a fvwm menu to a tkg button, use
a Tcl command (in the "Advanced" preferences page) like this:

fvwm send 0 {popup "Utilities"}

Of course, tkgoodstuff also has a Menu button with a GUI-configurable
menu . . .

I wager 5 guilders that you're using a graphics card which does a
virtual screen in hardware.  If there is memory left over for
additional pictures some graphics cards provide a panning feature
(pan if mouse touches edge of screen) in order to look at the
additional pictures.  Of course, Fvwm knows nothing about this
hardware feature.  Turn it off in your hardware or X setup.

Well, I can't prove this was reported  before, and I  can't find it in
the bug list or todo list.  Never the less,  I have the problem, and I
assume others can reproduce it as well.  If not, I would be interested
to hear that.

To give the problem a short description:

"keyboarding doesn't work after exiting certain applications including
Netscape, when the mouse pointer drops on to the root window".

Despite the subject line above, this is not a new problem in 2.0.45.

You need to be compiling with fvwm 2.0.45, since those functions were recently
added to libfvwm.

Hi,

I have:
Linux 2.0.27, XF 3.2, fvwm2.0.45 only with icons-in-pager patch

The bug:

- during a telnet session in a color-xterm, I started from a
FvwmButton Netscape, which is configured to start on another desk than
the xterms.

- when Netscape popped up by changing the current desk, the xterm
window lost her title and became stick. 8-))))

I think this is really difficult to reproduce. I bet that the terminal
was in a wait state for a character to come when the desks forcedly
changed and that produced the bizare comportment.

However, I lllllove strange things


Thanks for your attention

I'm using fvwm 2.0.45. I want to have a function that, if I click anywhere
on a window (including inside it), will raise the window. Like:

AddToFunc raise_func
+      "C" Raise
Mouse 0 W A raise_func

But this doesn't pass the click on to the application in the window. Is there
a way to do that with the new fvwm?

FvwmIconMan 0.9.6 is out. I only changed 1 line of C code, adding an XSync()
call after the window shape gets changed. Hopefully this will fix a problem
where when the shape changes, parts of the window which were not in the old
shape, but are in the new don't get drawn. If you don't see that problem,
there's no point in getting this (assuming you have 0.9.5 now).

I haven't gotten any bug reports for a while, and I've fixed the last bug that
I know about. So, unless anybody speaks up soon, I'm going to ask Chuck to
update the distribution to include the latest version.  (BTW, the latest is
0.9.6, if you are using an older version and have a bug, you should still
email me, but mention which version you are using. Thanks).

I have a button in tkGoodStuff that is bound to 

   fvwm send 0 {Menu Utilities Nop ""}

This brings up whatever the "Utilities" menu in fvwm is defined as,
assuming that tkGoodStuff is running as a module.

There's a global option MouseFocusClickRaises which you can set to do
this.  See the GlobalOpts entry in the man page for details.

It is strange, and I don't know where the problem comes from: I can
select almost any window I like with the function GoThere, except for
FvwmIconMan.

,-----
| AddToFunc GoThere               "I" Iconify -1
| +				  "I" WarpToWindow 50 50
| +                               "I" Focus 
`-----

I use it like this:

,-----
| Key i A 4 Next [--Mail--] Function GoThere
| Key y A 4 Next [CurrentDesk FvwmIconMan] Function GoThere
`-----

I have more lines like this, and all of them work (including others
with "CurrentDesk"), *except* the FvwmIconMan line.  When I hit Alt-y,
nothing happens.

What's the story?

Now that mini icons are useful for things other than titlebar buttons
(FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager in particular) I noticed that some of my
windows weren't getting the mini icon assigned no matter what I did in
my .fvwm2rc.  Eventually I figured out that the windows in question
were those which were given NoTitle as a Style.  Since I initially
thought it was a bug in FvwmIconMan, I pestered Brady Montz with the
problem.  I thank him for his patience and also for pointing out the
right place to fix it in the code.  Attached is a patch to
add_window.c that fixes the problem.

	start FvwmAuto 100

	put 2 somewhat overlapping windows on a screen
	
	go to window A

	go to window B, (not touching root)

	go back to A, _before_ B is _raised_, but be sure to 
	stay in	the area, where the 2 windows overlap.


the last 2 steps must happen very quickly (just leave A for 50 ms)	

focus keeps toggling between the two windows and they'll be raiseed
alternatively, until the mouse leaves the space where the 2 windows
overlap.

after a few tries you'll get the feeling how to trigger the effect.

So this is a _very_ bad interaction between fvwm2 & FvwmAuto.

>From my debug output FvwmAuto behaves correctly, so what seems to happen
is: 

apparently, FvwmAuto gets a new focus event _after_ the raise, 
which was originated _before_ the raise.
The raise event triggers a new focus event (since we're in the overlap
area).


time	fvwm:				FvwmAuto:

 |	focus B
 |	focus A, because we re-entered	timeout expires, while we haven't
 |					seen the focus A yet  -> raise B
 v	focus B, because it's on top	timeout expires, but we haven't
					seen the focus B yet  -> raise A
and so on.

the 100ms just seem to be >= the round trip delay of the 
	FvwmAuto (raise) -> fvwm (focus) -> FvwmAuto (receive new focus)
path.

so the two columns seem to be executed in parallel, with the "left hand not
knowing what the right hand does"


I tried to get an interval where this effect is triggered:

	I got down to 70ms
	raising to 200 ms also

	raising the timeout to 300 ms, I noticed an interesting effect:
	the flipping stops after some time:

	I got 6, 65, 3, 5, 4, 16, 63 flips so far

Increasing the time slows down the FvwmAuto column in the above timing
diagram, so at some point the next focus event from fvwm arrives, before
the timeout elapses, so the raise is cancelled.


Can anybody suggest a solution ?

I guess, adding a paragraph to the man page saying:
	don't set timeout below 
	"complex-fn-depending-on-system-speed-load-and-windowsizes"
is out of question.

There are no details there, just a list of the GlobalOpts. But I tried it,
and when I clicked on a window, it raised, but the click never was sent to
the program underneath.

In my fvwmrc, I have:

# This just raises windows on a single click.
AddToFunc raise_func
+      "C" Raise
# Bind it to any click in a window.
Mouse 0 W A raise_func
# Make sure to pass the click events to the program in the window.
GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises

What'm I doing wrong?

What would cause this error to occur when fvwm2 is run instead of olwm, twm,

(I'm running reflection X, but I get this error when using an ExploraPro NCD
as well)

Any ideas?

FvwmIconMan 0.9.7 is out. 
Changes:
1. fixed bug where it would complain if you didn't specify a managergeometry
2. added two new button drawing styles: "raisededge" and "sunkedge" which can
   be used just like up, flat, and down. They look pretty spiffy.
3. added builtin function "warp" which warps the cursor to a button.
4. MAJOR CHANGE: when a manager window is empty, it no longer unmaps the
   window. This was just causing too many race condition headaches for me, as
   well as pissing me off everytime it would remap since the damn window would
   be on top of the window stack. Now, when the manager is empty, it displays
   a "title" button. It's the same size and shape as a regular button, but
   displays the manager's title string. I mainly added the new raisededge and
   sunkedge styles so that it'll be visually obvious when the manager is
   empty. If you've seen the manager windows creep a pixel at a time when you
   switch pages, this should fix it.

I would like to have a small screen next to my main screen, and put my button
bar for both screens on the small screen.  This way, I will have more real
estate on my large screen, and still have plenty of space for a large number of 
buttons and swallowed apps.

I would like the small screen to have no virtual desktop, but I would like the
pager for the large screen to be swallowed by the button bar on the small
screen.  Also, when the button bar is used (pushing buttons), I want the
resulting actions to affect the large screen.

That is, I click on a page in the pager on the small screen, and the BIG screen 
flips to the page I selected.

Is this possible with FVWM?

Do *not* bind the mouse click with "Mouse 0 W A raise_func".
MouseFocusClickRaises binds all three mouse buttons all by itself.

I tried adding just "GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises" to my fvwmrc, getting
rid of the other stuff. But clicking in a window does not raise it.

Where can I find docs on this, or a fvwmrc that actually has it working?

I had to apply the following patch to the fvwm source.  I got it from the
mailing list archives.  I don't have the authors name handy right now.
I had to apply the patch with the -F 3 option, otherwise it wouldn't work with
the 2.0.45 sources.  After that the GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickRaises worked.

Does anyone know if there is a way to have the ClickRaises option work with
SloppyFocus? I have SloppyFocus set right now, but I get MouseFocus if I set the
MouseFocusClickRaises options. Given the name of the option, it looks like that
is what is intended.

Just for the record: I applied the patch manually.  I use SloppyFocus.
Everything works, including SloppyFocus.

A friend of mine over here @AGFA.be
saw me using fvwm(2) and picked on me because of the colors
I used by default (-> [jargon file] :angry fruit salad: /n./).

So I decided to change over to fvwm95.

I got the impression (but I did not find that confirmed),
that fvwm95 is a very close fvwm2 relative.

Are they maintained in parallel?

Can I run an ordinary fvwm2 as fvwm95?
(With proper startup file(s) ?!?)

cheers

Fvwm95's FvwmWinList (`FWL') is not behaving properly,
it's not strictly fixed to the left bottom of the screen,
instead it's also extending sometimes beyond the bottom.

And it's continuously moving to the right:
whenever you have a title longer than the ones used so far,
it's certainly resizing (i.e. growing) to the right _and_ to the left (1).
But if it's shrinking,
it's shrinking centerwards.
So you get a gap on its left side.
I think it should shrink on its right side.

Fvwm2's FvwmWinList behaves mostly properly.
(Although it's quite messy,
when you run the Tk installation tests,
where you also get many messages from the test scripts
about unexpected behaviour.)

Perhaps I shouldn't use FvwmWinList at all / any longer,
because WinList also does a quite good job.

But I like this batch of bars
listing those programs I'm interested in
(I'm using WindowListSkip)
since I used twm then.

I even suggest a strict left alignment for the strings listed there.

----

(1) to the left probably only,
    if there is (already) free space
    between the FWL and the left edge of the screen.

fvwm95 was developed starting from fvwm 2.0.42 or .43 or something.

Not that I know of.

fvwm 2.0.45 can imitate pretty much of the look and feel of Win'95, as
far as I'm concerned.  I can send you my .fvwm2rc which gives you the
look but not the feel of Win'95.  2.0.45 has lots of options to deal
with the title bar colors and the border colors.  Pretty nifty is the
gradient stuff, but I don't use it as I'm a friend of subdued colors.
(I use grey and black for everything except for the root window and
the title bar background, which are midnightblue.)

You want FvwmIconMan.  It's everything that twm-to-fvwm converts have
been waiting for.  New versions support MiniIcons.  Yay Brady!

It tried to make fvwm-2.0.45 on under Solaris2.4. Compilation goes
fine. However, if I do a Make install, everything goes wrong. The make

          [ -g group ] [ -o ] [ -s ] dirx ...
     /usr/sbin/install [ -m mode ] [ -u user ]
          [ -g group ] [ -o ] [ -s ] file [ dirx ...  ]

The makefile however, executes install -c file directory, so the order
of the two arguments is wrong.

Anybody recognizes this problem and knows how to solve it?
Perhaps someone has rewritten the MakeMakefiles for Solaris 2.4?

You can set INSTALL to /usr/ucb/install in Fvwm.tmpl or Imakefile.  Or
you can correct it in your X setup.

When I got the 1st response to my recent postings,
I visited the fvwm home page,
and installed fvwm95-2.0.42a.

FvwmWinList has much improved,
so my former problem description is rather obsolete.

But:

If the string is displayed without mini icon,
it should nevertheless line up with the other strings,
I think - that looks much better.

WinList does this,
and FvwmWinList should do it, too.

I'm really a fan of modest colour schemes,
but the '95 colour scheme is quite nice actually.

Thanks for fvwm and for the '95 branch!

cheers

Hi,

I have only ever used FVWM on ULTRIX platform, and now find myself
forced to move to the NT platform.

So this may seem like a really silly question, but is there a FVWM for
NT platform? 

Many thanks,

Anup

Hi there!

I have just downloaded the fvwm ver number 2.0.45 on my Sol 2.5 box.
Don't know what to next. Is there anybody out there who can help me in
compiling the stuff. If possible, if somebody has documented set of steps to
compile it.

Thanks in advance

Just as all modern GNU stuff:

	tar ztvf PACKAGE.tar.gz
	cd PACKAGE
	./configure
	make

So far as ordinary user, but this part as root:

	make install

---------------

This kind of answer does not justify my _public_ answer.

The reason why I do it nevertheless:

A colleague of mine installed this package also on a Solaris 2.5 box,
and the `make install' created /usr/local/{bin,lib}
only _after_ copying something `below' those directories.
But because `below' does not work,
/usr/local/{bin,lib} are created as ordinary files instead.

That must be repaired.

Normally this bug does not have any effect,
because `everybody' already has those directories,
but apparently some don't ...

So for the time being:

	mkdir /usr/local/{bin,lib}

before `make install' as root.

Hi,

	My name is Richard Wicks and I just subscribed to this list about an
hour ago, so if this is an inappropriate forum for this question, please flame
me and I'll never do it again.

	I wanted to make a module for fvwm2 but since I've never made a module
for any window manager I wasn't sure if it is possible.  Basically, I want
to make a module startup when fvwm2 is started and intercept button presses
#1 and #2 on the ROOT window.  I thought that in this way, I could make
a similar pop up menu that could be configured right from the menu, rather
than having to edit the .fvwm2rc file by hand.  It would have a separate
configuration file apart from fvmw2 as well.

	The module would allow you to modify the commands by popping up a
transient window below the pop-up when the shift key was pressed while
an item was simultaneously selected.  Also, you could add items, and remove
them on the fly as well.  All changes would be saved in a separate
configuration file, with some number of backups so you can undo errors,
or prevent your kids from making you life even worse.

	So, is it possible to redirect the button press events to a module
rather than have fvwm2 intercept them?  I really think that fvwm2 is the
best and most configurable window manager available, and I think by adding
a module like this, it would be usable by a greater number of people. 

thanks alot,
-Rich

Does fvwm have a 'configure' file?  I compiled 2.0.45 last week and the
process was:

	edit Fvwm.tmpl
	make Makefiles
	make


[snip]

While I'm writing, I thought I'd mention the following.

I compiled v2.0.45, realised I'd left out a critical '/' in one of the
paths in Fvwm.tmpl, so made the change to that file, and started the
process again.  The trouble was that 'make Makefiles' didn't rebuild
the Makefiles in the directories fvwm, modules/*, etc.  It was no
problem, as I just deleted all of the old Makefiles and ran
'make Makefiles' again, but shouldn't make detect the change in
Fvwm.tmpl (which, after all, affects xmkmf's output in this case).

Yes.
I don't think all tar's cope with this though, best to unzip and
then untar.

Sigh. And you missed out the 'xmkmf' stage.
The process is:
	gunzip package.tar.gz
	tar xvf package.tar
	cd package
	more README
	more INSTALL
	[do what those files say!]
This is the foolproof method!

Surely you really wanted to do a 'make clean'?
That should've sorted you out nicely.

i'm trying to convert some olvwm users to fvwm.
the reason they still use olvwm is the easy placement of applications
on the desktop. they can start a couple of applications in parallel,
and olvwm puts their windows on different pages when they pop up. every
time an application pops up a new window, it gets placed on the page
that's been configured for this application's name.

the Style command StartsOnDesk offers half of a solution. i miss a
StartsOnPage counterpart.

how about a StartsOnPage? simple enough to be added to 2.0.4[67]? to
big of a task for fvwm 2.1? not even for >2.1 as this lacking feature
shall be the reason why not all olvwm users should be tempted to turn
over to fvwm? :-)

[...browsing the TODO list...] oh, there is an entry for StartsOnPage!
but the question remains: any plans when it will get implemented?

shall i try to make patch that implements that feature?

dear folks,

i would like to report an apparent bug in fvwm2 that extends up to
2.0.45.  the problem occurrs with the program Maelstrom running on an X
server managed by fvwm2 with libc-5.4.x.  this bug manifests itself in
Maelstrom having a window if indefinately large size that extends to the
right and below.  in 2.0.43 the window would also extend to cover any
virtual desktops that were to the right and below the place from which
the program was initially run.  in 2.0.45, this window doesn't extend to
any other desktops than the one it is run on.  Maelstrom only occurs
within the upper left 640x480 space of this window (it normally only
runs in a 640x480 window).

Maelstrom works correctly on a server managed by fvwm1 with libc-5.4.x
and on a server managed by fvwm2 with libc-5.2.18.  

if it is pertinent, this behavior has persisted through almost all of
the recent 2.0.x kernel series, running XFree86 3.2 and Accelerated-X,
and on at least three different machines (a 486, pentium, and a PPro). 
in my experience, this behavior has not been exhibited with any other
programs.

happy bug hunting.

I'm using 2.0.45 (SunOS) and have the following remark & questions:

Remark(bug?):

 I have the following ButtonStyles in my fvwm2rc file

 # Standard X
 ButtonStyle 1 17 20x20@1 30x20@1 50x40@1 70x20@1 80x20@1 80x30@0 60x50@0 80x70@1 80x80@0 70x80@0 50x60@0 30x80@0 20x80@0 20x70@0 40x50@1 20x30@0 20x20@1
 # Nested Right Angles (looks nice)
 ButtonStyle 2 14 0x0@1 0x20@1 20x20@0 20x0@0 0x0@1 0x25@1 25x25@1 25x0@1 55x0@1 55x55@0 0x55@0 0x60@1 60x60@1 60x0@1

 Style "*" Color White/DimGray, WindowListSkip, NoHandles, DecorateTransient, BorderWidth 3

 which works fine for the most part except on a few windows.  On those few
 windows, button-2 is non-existent.

 Easiest way to replicate what I'm seeing would be through Netscape.  While 
 using Netscape, try to ftp something which will spawn a query window
 prompting the user for a file name to use and directory location (the window
 name is "Save As... (type application/x-tar, encoding x-compress)" ).  That
 query window on my system will get spawned only with button-1.


Questions:

1. Is there a way grow the pager via a hot-key or a menu click.  In other
   words, I currently use a 'DeskTopSize 3 3 & FvwmPager 0  0' and would
   sometimes like to expand my view to say 'FvwmPager 0  2'.  The way I'm doing
   it now is by killing my current pager, and then invoking a new Pager via
   'FvwmPager 0  2'.  Is there anyway to say "grow by 1" or "shrink by 1" and
   have it replace the current pager that I'm looking at; would it be possible
   to yank on the borders and grow the pager, but instead of the internals
   growing, get a duplicated view (actually, it would be nice to have both
   features - grow the internals and/or get an expanded look based on some user
   defined variables) ?

2. David S. Goldberg (dsg@linus.mitre.org) wrote "RTFM, particularly the
   section on EdgeResistance" when asked about how to disable scrolling.
   From my experiments the true way to disable scrolling is via 
   "EdgeResistance 10000 10000" and not "EdgeScroll 0 0" as it states in the
   man pages.  The reason I'm saying this is due to the fact that you can still
   scroll even if you have "EdgeScroll 0 0" in your .fvwm2rc when you move
   windows about.
   --> Clarification on how to _completely_ disable scrolling (TogglePage) ??

3. Is there a way to bind _multiple_ complex functions to a key/stroke ?
   In other words, can I do the following:

      AddToFunc my-window-sizer
      +       "C"     Maximize 50 100
      +       "D"     Maximize 50 100, Move 50 0

   instead of

      AddToFunc my-window-sizer
      +       "C"     Maximize 50 100
      +       "D"     Maximize 50 100
      +       "D"     Move 50 0

   It seems as though some modules accept the comma (WinList, IconMan, etc)
   to bind actions to keys/strokes while others don't, is there anyway to
   generalize on this and make it applicable to everything (ie. through
   fvwm's parsing)


Thanks in advance for the help.

I downloaded and compiled the latest version of fvwm2, to verify that these
problems have not been solved, which I have had with an earlier version.

fvwm doesn't always connect to the remote terminal properly (using xdm)

This seems to happen when the remote terminal uses a dns name to specify the
address of the terminal.

If in xdm failsafe mode, I enter 'fvwm2 -display <ipaddress>:0' it works.
if in xdm failsafe mode, I enter 'fvwm2 -display <dns name>:0' it fails.

As an aside, I've had this error when trying to run xdm on consoles of
solaris 2.5.1 as well, though it only seems to happen on half the machines.
Display :0 can't be opened?  doesn't seem reasonable.

Perhaps there is an error in the gethostbyname code?  or perhaps I need to
throw a special compile flag?  Perhaps my xdm configuration is flawed?

has ANYBODY had this problem before? 

Please help

Been there (I once made an FvwmAuto -- in a module written in Python, posted
once upon a time in this list, which included FvwmClean, FvwmAudio and
similars). I remember a quick argument with Rob about it. To summarize:

- AutoRaise can only be reliable if done by fvwm. (I think I couldn't convince
Rob of this, sigh)

- Rob had no intention of bringing AutoRaise back from a module.

- You have to live with FvwmAuto and fvwm functioning asynchronously. That
means the "black dot", transient window overlapping etc. can't be completely
avoided.

Your extensive testing (much better than mine!) seems to reinforce my
conclusion. Sorry.

PS:
If you have any suggestions to hack out the "black dot", I'm ready to try
anything -- my sparc10 is always slower than me :-)

I definitely second your findings, at first I thought it was a bug with
Maelstrom, but like you said, on fvwm version 1 it works correctly.

In my experience, Netscape shares this exact same problem.  I'm also
running on Linux (2.0.29), XFree86 (3.2), libc-5.4.13.  When I launch
netscape, it always creates a window larger than the physical screen
size.  Has anyone else seen this behavior in Netscape?

Q.1) How can I add a single application to all the desks??
   (Like FWM Pager is there on all the desks)

Q.2) When ever I click mouse on any of the windows it is brought
     to the top but I have to click again to get it in context??
     What I want is that as I move my mouse on a xterm it should
     become active and my keyboard input should go to that xterm.
     Rightnow I have click once to make that xterm active.

You are destroying a running function.  When ScreenSaver1 returns it
returns to ScreenSaver, but that function no longer exist (a new
function exists, but it may be somewhere else in memory).  Maybe the
memory once used by the first instance of ScreenSaver has been
reclaimed and used for something else.

Make it sticky.  There is a function for that.  RTFM and search for
"sticky".

RTFM and search for ClickToFocus and for FocusFollowsMouse and for
SloppyFocus.  I use SloppyFocus and I'm very happy with it.

Regarding oversized windows, we are also seeing this with 'xddts' on a Sparc
Solaris 2.5 system. When the project selection window is opened, it grows
horizontally to fill the entire screen and then some.

I had no problems with fvwm 1.24r. I'm not saying this is a fvwm2 bug, it
could be that xddts (which is just an X wrapper around ddts) is not doing
something quite right and it didn't bother fvwm1. I'm using fvwm 2.0.44.

i've got a couple question for things i'd like to do in my .fvwm2rc

1) i'd like be able to bind actions of my mouse to buttons on a
   specific window or to a specific icon.  e.g. when i right click
   on the netscape mail icon, i'd like to get a special menu with
   Get New Mail

2) i guess being able to do 1) would let me do this, but...
   another thing i'd like to be able to do is have an icon (the
   netscape mail one) be sticky, but the opened window not be.
   that is, i'd like to see the icon on every "page" but when i
   open the window, i don't want that following me around.

4) i think this is more of a request than a question, becuase 
   i;m pretty sure fvwm2 doesn't currently support this.
   it'd be really nice if i could have setting so if i start a
   process on a certain "page" then every other window spawned by
   that process would appear on that "page" without causing me
   to switch.  e.g. the Dotfile Generator pops up heaps of
   different windows.  i'd like to be able to start an action and
   go to another window to do work while the Dotfile program is
   working--it's a bit slow--without having all the different
   window is spawns popping up on me.  (i know you can set windows
   to appear on a specific desktop and not jump there, but i'd
   like a general setting on a process level so i don't need to
   know the names of every window the application might spawn.

thanks in advance

Even after setting the geometry resources in the Netscape app-defaults file?
Or even in you Xdefaults file?

Hi,

I'm not on the mailing list, so if you are able to help, please reply to
ekahler@mars.superlink.net.

	I've recently compiled fvwm2.0.45, and now when I resize my windows,
the cursor changes, but there is no outline depicting the new size of
the window.  Similarly, when I move a window, the cursor changes, but
there is nothing else visible to indicate the position of the new
window.

	This is making X quite uninhabitable.  Do you have any idea what I have
done, or how I can get the "rubber bands" back when I move and resize?

Thank you,
Eric.

This bit me too. You probably want to stick a XOrValue value command into
your .fvwm2rc. I use "XOrValue 65535"

To help any further, I have the following in my .Xdefaults file:

Netscape*Navigator.geometry:    =730x570+0+0
Netscape*Mail.geometry:         =730x570

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Don't know how many folks are using the rc converter but judging by the
number of questions still asked about fvwm1.24r there may still be a
need. 

It was missing a conversion for StartsOnDesk and also had a bug in the
WindowListSkip conversion (missing newline. *blush*). 

I've attached the patch.  

Chuck: can you apply this to  2.0.45?  It's been tested. 

Thanks, 
-Bill

the font size (in netscape).

I never had this problem (linux 2.0.29, XFree86 3.2, libc-5.4.13) running
netscape. I run at resolutions of 1024x768 and up, and I've never had
netscape run at a size bigger than my screen...

For the record (if anyone cares), changes to .Xdefaults and

Could someone please explain how 'Restart fvwm2' works.
 I've noticed that even if I _delete_ my executable file (fvwm) while fvwm
 is running and Restart, it will restart without a hitch (shouldn't it re-read
 the binaries again in case they've changed ?).  I came across this when I
 modified one of the files (functions.c) and included some printf's which never
 showed up (via restarts) until I killed the process and command-line
 started fvwm.

MouseFocus vs. ClickToFocus:
 From my adventures into seeing why a certain feature does not work for me 
 (and I am SURE it doesn't work for _me_), I've come to believe that
 ClickToFocus and MouseFocus function quite differently internal to fvwm 
 (in terms of including windows in the Window-list structure of last focused
 things).  In other words, if you have 4 windows on your current desk and you
 have ClickToFocus enabled and you circulated around them, then the focused
 list would be 1->2->3->4 (Scr.Focus - next - prev); if, on the word hand, you
 have MouseFocus then the list would _not_ be 1->2->3->4 even though you went
 through the same focusing procedure (ie. you circulated through the same 
 windows).  I haven't been able to determine how MouseFocus'ed windows are 
 included into that list, any ideas ?

Thanks,

 - Nadim

This problem happened to my Maelstrom too, but it got corrected by another

So I understand that it is not possible from FvwmAuto to check if a
window 
exists or it is really focused before trying to raise it. I can
understand 
the Rob (and Chuck, I suppose) idea of keeping small fvwm2, and...
well...
autoraising is almost a religious issue, I think. But colud not be
possible
to add a function to the main fvwm2 (or an option to Raise and Lower
command) 
in the style "raise it if and only if the window exists and is focused,
otherwise do a Nop"? Then FvwmAuto can use it to solve (I think) both
the black 
dot and the flip-flop problem.

I used the hack proposed by albrecht (thanks*1000!) and it works for me:

AddToFunc raise_if_exist "I" WindowId $w raise
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 1500 raise_if_exist

I have no more black dots since then. Hope this helps you.

Hello!

I spent several hours last day trying to get fvwm2 to parse my
.fvwm2rc file with FvwmM4. It didn't work at first...

In the man pages it says that if you want to use FvwmM4 you should
start fvwm with the following sequence:

fvwm -f "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

This is not true!

After trying out different theories for a long time I took a look
at the source for fvwm. In the part where the args passed to it is
checked one can see that:

(Skip this if you are not interested in the details)

If you pass -f as above:

if (mystrncasecmp(argv[i],"-f",2)==0)
{
  if (++i >= argc)
    usage();
  config_command = (char *)malloc(6+strlen(argv[i]));
  strcpy(config_command,"Read ");     <---
  strcat(config_command,argv[i]);     <---
  free_config_command = True;
}

This will cause the config_command to be "Read FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc".
Wich doesn't work.

If you use:

fvwm -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"

to start fvwm this will happen:

if (mystrncasecmp(argv[i],"-cmd",4)==0)
{
  if (++i >= argc)
    usage();
  config_command = argv[i];
}

Now config_command will be "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc". And that, I think, is 
how it should be.

I hope someone will find this information usefull. I would have fond
it so last night. :-)

The man pages should atleast be changed to the correct information.

Please feel free to make any comments about this. I would appreciate if
you could send any replys to this mail to my email aswell as to the
mailinglist. I don't know how often I am going to read this list.

Regards

The attached diff fixes 2 minro glitches in the Fvwm.tmpl file.
The $(CCLINK) macro, not the $(CC) macro should be used to link
executables under X11R6, at least release 3.  This makes a difference
on platforms where LD_RUN_PATH is used to set the runtime path for
shared objects.  Ie, my CCLINK macro is:

LD_RUN_PATH=/opt/X11R6/lib cc

Thanks a lot.

How does flipfocus work?  I have:

Key  R9         RWTSFIA N       Prev [CurrentPage] FlipFocus

do not use click-to-focus, and only have a few xterms in the circulate
list, which is always what I want to flip between.  This does not seem
to work a lot of the time.  I seem to have to focus the window, click,
and press return in various combinations between the two windows before
I can get this to work.  

Also, what's the difference between FlipFocus and Focus, when used in
this manner?

Hi
	For some reason only two of 12 icons show up in my button bar at the
bottom. My .fvwmfmgr file says I have to copy them to my home directory
(Doah ! ... that didnt work) but if it finds two why can't it find the
rest in the directory where they really are ? I am having some color
problems that I am trying to hammer out, not sure if this is related to
the problem or not. The buttons work fine but the icons dont show up.
Any help is greatly appreciated. Please email to tjsmith@oakland.edu
instead of terry@rust.net if you will. Thanks in advance.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

I have finished an alpha version of a re-write of fvwmperl.pl in Perl 5. The
new version features:

* Package structure, allowing inclusion via "use", selective symbol importing
	You would now utilize this via:

		use X11::Fvwm qw(list of synbols to use); # Or just ":all"

	See example below.

* Compiled code for the constants from fvwm.h and module.h
	I use an XS module to compile a C routine that uses fvwm.h and module.h
	directly to supply values for parameters such as M_WINDOW_NAME and
	C_ALL.

* Improved registering and activation of event handlers
	Event handlers are now stored in lists within a hash table keyed by
	an event mask. Handlers are passed as subroutine references rather than
	by names, allowing you to pass a closure rather than a "real" 
	subroutine. No longer is there need for "GenerateHandlers", or for a
	code-eval that contains more if-comparisons than necessary. See below
	for sample code.

* Easy fit with other Perl 5 extensions such as Penguin and Tk
	Because of the namespace-protection, there is little hazard of names
	like "InitModule" and "EndModule" colliding with other utilities and/or
	libraries.

Here is the simple text-only window list example from fvwmperl.doc, re-written
for the new style:

#!/usr/bin/perl

# MiniPerl - small, instructive example of a fvwm module implemented
# in Perl.
# (c)1996 Dan Astoorian <djast@utopia.csas.com>

use X11::Fvwm qw(InitModule AddHandler SendInfo EventLoop EndModule
                 M_WINDOW_NAME M_END_WINDOWLIST);
use IO::File;

$fh = new IO::File "> /dev/console";

($winId, $context, @args) = InitModule(M_WINDOW_NAME | M_END_WINDOWLIST);

# Register the event handlers
AddHandler(M_WINDOW_NAME,
           sub {
               my ($type, $id, $frameid, $ptr, $name) = @_;
               printf $::fh ("Window ID %8lx: %s\n", $id, $name);
               # return one, to signal we want the event loop to continue
               1;
           });
# This one returns 0 to sigal that it terminates the module.
AddHandler(M_END_WINDOWLIST,
           sub { print $::fh "---end of window list\n"; return 0; });

print $fh "---start of window list\n";
# Ask FVWM to send us its list of windows
SendInfo(0, "Send_WindowList");

# Enter the main loop
EventLoop;

# We're done; clean up.
EndModule;


Note that module-style usage and Perl 5 syntactic sugar make some things 
clearer-- the imported names do not need their leading "&" when called (note
that the constants like M_END_WINDOWLIST are actually routines of the form
"sub M_END_WINDOWLIST { 16384; }" and thus would be referenced with & rather
than $). The handler routines were not pre-defined, but rather passed to
AddHandler on-the-fly. I also use IO::File to specifically send the output to
the console rather than the STDOUT of fvwm. One could, of course, remove that
and have it go to STDERR or STDOUT. Or to a pipe, or to a socket... :-)

Before I upload the alpha to a CPAN site (the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network; don't fret, I'll post downloading instructions), I still intend to
port FvwmDebug.pl to this model (where it will be called X11::FvwmDebug),
and possibly (though this may wait for a later alpha release) a module called
X11::FvwmPipe to facilitate stand-alone modules that communicate with Fvwm2
via the FvwmPipe module in the extras directory. This isn't a high-priority,
because when I've run tests with FvwmPipe, I've found it to be of limited
usefuleness, and it hikes my workstations load noticably (could be a SIGIO-
related problem; I know that XEmacs has such an issue, and checks for it at
configuration time).

Anyway, this is mostly a heads-up kind of announcement. I expect to come in
some tomorrow for extra polish (and, unfortunately, to finish some paperwork
for the boss), but by Monday or Tuesday, I should have the alpha release out.

Recently I switched to fvwm2 on my HP9000s700. Everything is great
except that I lost the Escape key. This key now become a DEL key. 
I noticed that the key DOES have both "DEL(in blue)" and "ESC(in red)"
printed on it. Apparently I got ESC from this key when I was using mwm
or HP vue environment. But now I got DEL from this key and it is really
annoying since I cann't type a ESC from the keyboard. Imaging editing in
emacs without an ESC key! 

	Please help! My email address is mao@cmu.edu.

	Thanks a million.

Hi
	I tried to write this question before I actually subscribed but
now I am subscribed here. Anyhow, my problem is that the button bar at the
bottom is missing 8 out of 10 icons. My icon path and my pixmap path are
fine and all the .xpm icons are there but only the newspaper one shows up
and the clock works too. The buttons work but the icons aren't there. The
wierd thing is that all the .xpm files are in the pixmap directory , which
is what the
.fvwmrc file is asking for right. I noticed that there is a file called
newspaper in the bitmap directory (no extension, xv says its a bitmap
file), and that is the only
match in the bitmaps directory. It should not be picking that one up
anyhow since the .fvwmrc file is asking for the .xpm not any thing else,
and again, all the proper .xpm icons are in the pixmap directory. Seems
like it should be working fine, according to the .fvwmrc file. Then I
noticed something in the .fvwmfmgr file that noted that I have to copy the
icons to my directory, my home directory I am assuming. This doesnt seem
to get me anywhere. 
  
Sorry if this seems confusing but I am doing my best. I installed this on
two machines and the same thing happens. I got fvwm from the BSDI package.
I am also having some color problems that may or may not be related. Maybe
it craps out on icons that have colors I cant have ? But I doubt it
because it happened on two totally different machines. 

So what I am wondering is where .fvwmrc looks for icons ? The bitmap
directory or the pixmap directory, .fvwmrc specifies both directories. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Terry

Netscape sucks up vast amounts of colors. It WILL fill up a color map
on an 8 bit deep display. And most sun framebuffers are only 8bits deep.
You have X on your Number9 configured to 16bits? Use xdpyinfo to see what
your X display can do.

Alternatives:

"netscape -install".  Produces colormap flashing.

"netscape -ncols 150".  Gifs aren't as pretty as they could be, if
Netscape isn't allowed to use more than 150 colors.  I use this
alternative most of the time.

=> 
=> i've got a couple question for things i'd like to do in my .fvwm2rc
=> 
=> 1) i'd like be able to bind actions of my mouse to buttons on a
=>    specific window or to a specific icon.  e.g. when i right click
=>    on the netscape mail icon, i'd like to get a special menu with
=>    Get New Mail
=> 
=> 2) i guess being able to do 1) would let me do this, but...
=>    another thing i'd like to be able to do is have an icon (the
=>    netscape mail one) be sticky, but the opened window not be.
=>    that is, i'd like to see the icon on every "page" but when i
=>    open the window, i don't want that following me around.
=> 

Well I can't help with 1) but 2) is easy enough. You just need to specify
StickyIcon in a Style line in your .fvwmrc file. Something like;

Style "Netscape Mail" 	StickyIcon, Slippery

will ensure that the icon follows you around but the window doesn't.


Cheers,

I compiled and installed fvwm-2.0.45 on a Sun system with Solaris 2.4.
So far it went fine.
I work on an X-terminal, and use xdm to start X. I edited my .xinitrc to
start fvwm2 in stead of olwm, but fvwm2 won't start.
If I examine the /var/tmp/xdm-errors file I see the following error
message:

 System warning: Object 0x251b0, Permission denied, open of /dev/console
failed  (Tty package)
 fbconsole: open /dev/console: Permission denied
 ld.so.1: /usr/local/bin/fvwm2: fatal: libXpm.so.4.10: can't open file:
errno=2
 dsdm: another DSDM is already running
 896 Killed
 System warning: Object 0x251b0, Permission denied, open of /dev/console
failed  (Tty package)

So, it seems there is a problem opening libXpm, the library is in
/usr/openwin/lib.
My fvwm2 is in /usr/local/bin.

Anyone's got a clue?

Leo.

(1) Start fvwm with the right LD_LIBRARY_PATH, like so:
    env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/local/lib fvwm2 &
    Of course, you might need to change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The
    output of "ldd /usr/local/bin/fvwm2" might give you a clue.

(2) Use the -R option to ld so that the library search path is
    recorded in the executable.  This needs to be done in the final
    linking step to produce the fvwm executable.

There is no magic about the Pager.
And you even suggest yourself how to find out how it works:
Search you rc file for the pager,
and find something like

    Style "FvwmPager"       Sticky

`Sticky' is the attribute you ask for.

Well, there are different models of how the focus follows the mouse.

>From the `rc' file:

    #Style "*" ClickToFocus

That one was used before (obviously without `#').

    Style "*" SloppyFocus

But I also prefer this one.

I found that only by using the fvwm(95) `Configure' module

    (they call it `trails mouse' there;
    the alternatives are `follows mouse' and `click' (i.e. `click to type')),

which was removed temporarily from the distribution,
and looking at the `rc' `includable' file generated by it.

    SG>      Rightnow I have click once to make that xterm active.

This is correct, but the window column is confusing.  Just use A for Any.

Key  R9         A        N       Prev [CurrentPage] FlipFocus

> do not use click-to-focus, and only have a few xterms in the circulate

If you look at your window list, FlipFocus will always take you to then
next window as selected by Prev (This is the same as Focus).   The
window list is in an unknown state on start-up (or restart) so some
focus events are necessary before you know what FlipFocus will do.
Unless you cheat and look at the window list.  If you are trying
to switch between xterms, and want it to work on startup, try:

Key  R9         A        N       Prev [CurrentPage Xterm] FlipFocus
Key  R9         A        S       Prev [CurrentPage Xterm] Focus

This make R9 (What is R9?) toggle between the top two xterms, while
Shift-R9 will rotate around the list in the normal fassion.

> Also, what's the difference between FlipFocus and Focus, when used in
> this manner?

FlipFocus always switches to the Prev window on the list AND
switches the order of the list so that the next call to Prev will 
bring you to the window you were last in. Focus does not switch
the order on the list.  The best way to observe what FlipFocus does
is to watch the window list while using it.  You will see the order
change.

The default on my system is CDE. I've finally managed to get it to work on startup and logout on the death of FVWM, however I would like to use some of the keybindings that CDE uses with FVWM. These bindings don't seem to conflict with applications so hopefully they shouldn't with FVWM.
Does anyone know of a way to get these bindings from CDE or does anyone have a standard list of these bindings.


secondly I am fiddling about trying to get the decors working but I don't seem to have much luck. it would be nice if there were a script that would transfer current settings to a decor. also some of my mouse bindings to windows don't work properly when I use a defined decor.
there doesn't seem to be any documentation about this subject so any pointers would be apprieciated.

What a #^&%$!!  I'm playing with it, and I've yet to see anything that
reorders the window list when using mouse focus.  I'd *love* to use
FlipFocus, but I'm not changing to ClickToFocus just to do it!

I suppose I could start things in just the right order to get this all
to work out, but that seems really silly!

The sorting and reordering of the window list is one of the places I
think fvwm could use some improvement.  I discussed it with Charles
Hines a while back, and we could not think of a better way.

It would be possible to have sloppy focus (ie focus follows mouse)
reorder the window list.  This could be a big overhead so
perhaps is should be an option.  It has been a long time since I
looked at the code, and I am very busy.  If someone could point me
to the correct place for mouse focus code, I will look into the
possibility of reording the window list when focus follows
mouse is active.

Dan or anyone else,  

Try and explain this: I run WindowList from a menu, and it gives the
order

	Me
	Flamingo 
	You                     (dumb names)
	..others...

If I use FlipFocus, though, it moves between Me and You.

If I focus/raise Flamingo, the windowlist does not change, but
FlipFocus does not do anything at all now (but make the normal noise).
I focus/raise You, and FlipFocus still does nothing.  I raise/focus
Flamingo again, and now FlipFocus moves between Flamingo and you.
All this time, the list has been:

	Me
	Flamingo 
	You   
	..others...

Something is amiss here.

Thanks to all who answered.

Well, I tried this and is working so far.
That "WindowId" trick is really slick, Albrecht.

Now, if one could have functions as arguments, we could say:
AddToFunc do_if_exist "I" WindowId $w $0 $1...$9
and call:
do_if_exist iconify -1

to get Fvwm working from login:

start CDE with the openwin option
edit the .xintirc file
so that it looks something like below. the important bits are the wm shell varable
and the setting of fvwm's process id  ($wmpid)

fvwm should then run properly when you login again. when you exit fvwm then the seesion should exit smoothly also.

OW_WINDOW_MANAGER="$HOME/bin/fvwm -f $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc"
export OW_WINDOW_MANAGER

if [ "$OW_WINDOW_MANAGER" ]; then	# Alternate Window Manager
    xsetroot -def			    # Clear root window
    $OW_WINDOW_MANAGER & wmpid=$!	    # Start Alt Window Manager
#    dsdm &				    # OpenLook Drop Site Database
    unset OW_WINDOW_MANAGER
else
    sleep 15 & pid=$!			# OpenLook Window Manager
    olwm -syncpid $pid & wmpid=$!
    wait $pid				# Pause until olwm inits
fi

wait $wmpid				# Wait for wm (key client) to exit


hope this helps and works for you

Hi

I have a small problem:

I have some keyboard shortcuts for shifting desks (increment and
decrement). However, as the number of desks are not limited, i
can increment(or decrement) infinitely. I want the # of desks to be
limited (4 is enough for me) and to have warping. i.e. if i try
incrementing the desk when I am at desk 3, it would go to desk 0
and likewise from 0 to 3 when decrementing. 

How do I do it ? I am using 1.24r.

The key mapping for incrementing & decrementing :

Key Next        A       M       Desk -1 0 
Key F29         A       M       Desk -1 0
Key Prior       A       M       Desk 1 0 
Key F35         A       M       Desk 1 0 

maps the page-up, page-down keys of a sun keyboard (total 4) when
the meta key is pressed (the diamond key).

thanks a lot
Debjyoti

I am not certain but I am pretty confidant that 1.24r can redefine functions.  
Certainly 2.0.4x can.  One way to achieve what you want is to have two functions 
for going forwards and backwards around your desks that get redefined when you 
switch desks.  You need four desk warping functions thus:

AddToFunc GotoDesk1 "I" Desk 0 1
+                   "I" DestroyFunc NextDesk
+                   "I" DestroyFunc PrevDesk
+                   "I" AddToFunc NextDesk "I" GotoDesk2
+                   "I" AddToFunc PrevDesk "I" GotoDesk4

AddToFunc GotoDesk2 "I" Desk 0 2
+                   "I" DestroyFunc NextDesk
+                   "I" DestroyFunc PrevDesk
+                   "I" AddToFunc NextDesk "I" GotoDesk3
+                   "I" AddToFunc PrevDesk "I" GotoDesk1

AddToFunc GotoDesk3 "I" Desk 0 3
+                   "I" DestroyFunc NextDesk
+                   "I" DestroyFunc PrevDesk
+                   "I" AddToFunc NextDesk "I" GotoDesk4
+                   "I" AddToFunc PrevDesk "I" GotoDesk2

AddToFunc GotoDesk4 "I" Desk 0 4
+                   "I" DestroyFunc NextDesk
+                   "I" DestroyFunc PrevDesk
+                   "I" AddToFunc NextDesk "I" GotoDesk1
+                   "I" AddToFunc PrevDesk "I" GotoDesk3

Plus then in the startup functions You will need
+                   "I" AddToFunc NextDesk "I" GotoDesk2
+                   "I" AddToFunc PrevDesk "I" GotoDesk4

And then bind your next/prev keys to the dynamic functions
Key Next        A       M       NextDesK
Key F29         A       M       NextDesk
Key Prior       A       M       PrevDesk 
Key F35         A       M       PrevDesk 


This is off the top of my head and is not tested and probably doesn't work.
It relies on DestroyFunc which may not be in 1.24r.

Hope it helps anyway,
Timbo.

CDE on Solaris?  If so I've noted the following:

I think the .xinitrc MUST be bourne shell .....  Watch out for
the "odd" fontpath adopted by Solaris2 which makes netscape bold fonts (among
others look pretty "squished").  Here is my .xinitrc for what it's worth 
( fvwm2 is in my path and the .fvwm2rc is in my home ) with the fonts ajusted
...

The only "unsolved" problem I've come accross to-date is the xterm font
resize ( cntl+right mouse -> unreadable ) obliterates the text in the 
bufffer on resize.  All other fonts are ok.

(Incidently,  I tried the CDE installation manual's method of using the 
resource variable set to fvwm.  It worked fine but when you exit fvwm
you are left "stranded" with no way to logout!)

the way to get over this problem is to get fvwm's process number and wait until
it is complete. at that point the .xintirc shell completes and you logout
so you need to change

Hi,

My current button #2, which I use to minimize my windows is defined as:

ButtonStyle 4 16 60x40@1 60x80@0 15x80@0 15x40@1 60x40@1 40x40@1 40x25@1
75x25@1 75x60@0 60x60@0 75x60@0 75x40@0 85x40@0 85x15@0 60x15@1 60x25@1

If you'll allow a little poetic interpretation:  It looks like a small
"panel" in the upper right hand corner of the button space which is
becoming a large "panel" in the lower left hand corner of the button
space.  To me, it looks like a window which is being maximized.

I'd like button number 2 to look like a window which is being
minimized.  That is, I'd like a large panel in the upper right hand
corner of the button space, the same sized panel in the middle, and a
small panel in the lower left hand corner of the button space.

I tried to reverse the order of the vector definitions, but ended up
with the same size panels in the same places with a reversed shading.

Are there any Vector wizards out there who can help?

TIA,
Eric.

I have a strange one.  Whenever I start up MeetingMaker it starts up
on the page one left and one up from where I try to start it.  I
use a 3x3 desktop.  If I go to page 3 3 and start MeetingMaker, it 
starts on 2 2.  If I go to 1 3 and start it, it starts on 1 2.

Any ideas why this might be happening?

I also use SloppyFocus (and autoraise) and up until yesterday
FlipFocus would never work for me. It would always switch between two
arbitrary windows, but never between the windows that had focus
before. I eventually fixed the problem for my configuration. This is,
what I did:

 - I added the line
      Key F22         A       S       Prev [CurrentPage] Focus
   to my configuration file.

 - I started the FvwmWinList module.

 - I used Shift-F22 to switch between windows. When I monitored
   FvwmWinList, I noticed that this did not always work and the window
   of my "xconsole" was apparently causing problems.

 - I added a style option for the "xconsole" that removed it from the
   circulate list:
      Style "xconsole"     NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip, \
                           CirculateSkip,ClickToFocus
   (N.B. this is in fact just one long line; the line break was
   introduced for better readability of this message.)

 - Now the window list was no longer confused, so I added the
   FlipFocus command to my configuration file:
      Key F22         A       N       Prev [CurrentPage] FlipFocus

I should probably mention, that I also removed a few other windows
from the circulate list. But this was even before I worried about
FlipFocus:

      Style "Fvwm*"        NoTitle,Sticky,WindowListSkip,CirculateSkip
      Style "FvwmConsole"  Title,Handles,Slippery,WindowListHit,CirculateHit
      Style "FvwmButtons"  NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip, \
                           BorderWidth 0,ClickToFocus,CirculateSkip
      Style "FvwmWinList"  NoTitle,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip, \
                           BorderWidth 0,ClickToFocus,CirculateSkip
(Again, line breaks were introduced for better readability. They do not
occur in the actual "fvwmrc" file!)

I hope, this information is of some help. The conclusion is, that you
might have to play with style options, before FlipFocus works
reliably. I do not know, what the original problem was, but a wild
guess is, that the ClickToFocus style option was causing problems.

Wouldn't this cause the windows to relayer upon moving the mouse?
That would be REALLY annoying.  a smaller window on a larger one 
would vanish from view the moment the mouse slipped out of the big
window, forcing relocation, minimization, or utilization of the
window list - inconvienient.  Of course, if the order in the window 
list is a focus list instead of a layer list, it would be okay.

The order in the window list has no affect on how the desktop looks.

Well. . . I waited for your replies for about 3.5 ms, and then started
to work on the problem myself.  What I've gotten thus far is:

ButtonStyle 4 17 80x20@0 80x60@0 60x60@0 60x40@0 60x70@0 40x70@0 40x60@0
40x85@0 15x85@0 15x60@1 40x60@1 30x60@1 30x40@1 60x40@1 45x40@1 45x20@1
80x20@1

Which is very, very close to what I'm looking for.  In fact it will do
just fine, but I ran into another question:

It seems that the buttons aren't built on a standard x,y graph (where
the origin is in the lower left hand corner and x and y grow outward
from the origin) from the perspective of a user looking at the button;
am I right about this?  If that is so, exactly what are the orientations
of the x and y axis when one is designing a ButtonStyle from the
perspective of a user looking at the button?

I'd appreciate any help you can offer on this.
Eric.

The order in the window list has no affect on how the desktop looks.

Hello all!

To start, I would like to say that fvwm IS the best window manager in my
humble opinion.   It's very customizable and looks alot like mwm.  Now to
the point.  I just want to know two things:

1. How can I set/change the background color/picture from that dull gray
and black checker crap?

2. Where can I find cool pixmaps for fvwm?

Thanks for the help in advance!

=> 1. How can I set/change the background color/picture from that dull gray

To change your background you need to add a command to the InitFunction in
your .fvwmrc file.

you can use anything that changes the root window; xv -root, xsetroot, or
xpmroot (included with the fvwm distribution) xv has the advantage of using 
any format of image, but is rather slow, whereas xsetroot uses only .xbm 
files and xpmroot .xpm files, however they are faster (at least on my 
machine).

My InitFunction loooks like this

AddToFunc InitFunction  "I" Module FvwmAuto 100
+		        "I" Module FvwmButtons ControlBar /home11/imc/.barrc
+			"I" Module FvwmAudio
+		        "I" exec xpmroot /scratch11/imc/nwrm/pics/bkdrp-2.xpm
+		        "I" exec /home11/imc/bin/rxvt -pixmap /home11/imc/nwrm/pics/pixmaps/scream.xpm -scale T -display $DISPLAY -title "$HOST : ArghTerm" -n Aargh -geometry 80x45+420+175 & 
+		        "I" exec mailtool -scale small -iconic &
+		        "I" exec xfaces -geometry 70x700-0+150 & 


=> 
=> 2. Where can I find cool pixmaps for fvwm?
=> 

Hmmm... There are links to a number of icon/pixmap archives at the 
"Window Managers for X" page at 

http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/

Including some cool 3d appearance pixmaps... If you're using an 8-bit
colour display, you may find you run out of colours fairly quickly so
be careful when using really cool icons. Usually the cooler the icons 
the more colours they're going to use. I got ed up with this so I went 
and compiled my own set of pixmaps that all use the same 16 colour set.
You can find them at the address below...

Sorry about the shameless self-promotion, but hey, no one else is going 
to mention them...

Greetings,

This is driving me crazy so I am going to report it again and see if I
can't draw some attention.

HW/SW Setup
    SGI Indy R4000 running Irix 5.3
    FVWM 2.0.45 built using default SGI cc
        using default focus policy (I've not set anything)
    tkgoodstuff 8.0a2-14 built using default SGI cc

I am running with the FVWM Pager swallowed into tkgoodstuff.

THE BUG:  

1.  Click button1 on a FvwmPager desktop other than the current one.

2.  Move the mouse pointer to where a window on the new desktop will
    be drawn.

3.  Watch the new desktop get drawn on the monitor.

4.  THE BUG:  The window drawn under the mouse is NOT given keyboard
    focus by FVWM.

5.  I have to move the mouse out of the window and back in to get
    the focus set.

The frequency of the occurring appears to be a function of the number
of windows I have open and how quickly the new desktop can be drawn.

This is a *new* bug in 2.0.45 for me.  I never saw this behaviour with
2.0.44.  I'll be happy to provide my config files to anyone working on
this.

Thanks,
  --[Lance]

I'm running fvwm 2.0.45 on Solaris and Linux systems.  I have a vanilla
setup with .fvwm2rc containing:

    Mouse 1	TS	A	Move-or-Raise

    AddToFunc Move-or-Raise	"I" Raise
    +				"M" Move
    +  				"D" Lower

My problem is that a click of Mouse 1 on the title bar (to bring the window
up) causes the window to lose focus for about a second.

I'm a recent convert from twm, and this is something that twm did "right"
with 
          Function "move-or-raise" { f.move f.deltastop f.raise }

Any suggestions?

How can I configure FVWM so that the mouse buttons are reversed for a
left hander?  I've switched all the 3's to 1's and vice versa in the
.fvwm2rc file, but it doesn't work.

Mmm. Should work basically.
Say for example I have the line:

Mouse 1 R 	A 	Menu Utilities Nop

This means that mouse button one on the root window pops
up a menu.

Now, if you wanted to reverse this so that mouse three
on your left did the same just do this:

Mouse 3 R 	A	Menu Utilities Nop


Er..don't forget to restart fvwm or log out/in to see any changes.
(Just in case you're a newbie!)

Have another go, hope this helps.

fvwm.  Again thanks!

This is not generally a window manager function; X handles it at a lower
level.  Look at xmodmap.  In fact, the xmodmap even tells lefties what to
do:

xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

Hi'

I have a fvwm-2.0.45 setup with lots of toolbars, somewhat along the
lines of redhat. The different toolbars are constructed automatically
by m4 from the menus, and all this works just fine.

What I miss is a delete toolbar button to add to the constructed
toolbars. The problem is which FVWM command to associate with the
command.

- the 'KillModule' command doesn't work as the toolbars are started
  with the FVVWM command 'Module FvwmButtons <toolbar-name>'. The
  'KillModule' command doesn't know about aliases as used above.

- the 'Delete' and 'Close' commands doesn't work either as they means
  one have to double-click the delete toolbar icon.

What can be used instead? Any options on any of the above commands
that will make them work?

Fvwm waits to see if the click is a double click.  There's a timeout
for that which is by default set to 750 ms, I believe.  You can try to
click then immediately move the mouse a few pixels, focus should
return to the window quickly.

I think.

R> I used the hack proposed by albrecht (thanks*1000!) and it works for me:

R> AddToFunc raise_if_exist "I" WindowId $w raise
R> AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 1500 raise_if_exist

R> I have no more black dots since then. Hope this helps you.

so with my first implementation of the WindowId function as a parameter to
the Prev/Next/None functions (chuck migh still have it lying around),
this could be used:

AddToFunc raise_if_exist "I" Next [WindowId $w, Focus] raise
AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Module FvwmAuto 1500 raise_if_exist

If chuck isn't able to find it in his patches, I might search for it once
more, but chuck urged me to make it an own function and then he rewrote 
the Prev/Next/None stuff for a more elaborate syntax.

So he'll have to tinker with it anyways.

Chuck ?

as far as I know, this is working. (or I'm severely drunk at the moment)
my .fvwm2rc is full of such constructs.
have a look, it's on my homepage.

Thanks.  Your suggestion leads to a reasonable (for me) solution: just
delete the "D" option of Move-or-Raise.

Hi,

        I've finally figured out how to design buttons from the users
perspective.  For those would be button designers:

On a piece of graph paper, make a verticle Y axis on the right hand side
from 0 at the top of the Y axis to 100 at the bottom of the Y axis, and
make a horizontal X axis from 0 at the left hand side of the X axis to
100 on the right hand side of the X axis where, at 100, it will meet the
Y axis.  Then draw your button design on this graph, and mark the,
corners, or points of intersection, based on the (X,Y) coordinates of
this graph.  The button coordinates should be entered into one's .fvwmrc
in such an order as you can trace the lines from point to point on the
graph you made.  When you enter the coordinates into your .fvwm2rc use
the form XxY@shade.  From the users perspective the shade will be either
0 for shadow, or 1 for light.

These are the button styles which I've designed, I haven't seen them
before, so I believe they are new:


# 3 stacked square panels like stills of a window being minimized
#ButtonStyle 4 17 80x20@0 80x60@0 60x60@0 60x40@0 60x70@0 40x70@0
40x60@0 40x85@0 15x85@0 15x60@1 40x60@1 30x60@1 30x40@1 60x40@1 45x40@1
45x20@1 80x20@1

# 3 stacked rectangular panels like stills of a window being minimized
# could also represent windows being tiled
ButtonStyle 4 17 95x20@0 95x60@0 75x60@0 75x40@0 75x70@0 55x70@0 55x60@0
55x85@0 15x85@0 15x60@1 55x60@1 30x60@1 30x40@1 75x40@1 45x40@1 45x20@1
95x20@1

# 2 stacked rectangular panels like stills of a window being maximized
ButtonStyle 2 11 95x10@0 95x75@0 25x75@0 65x75@0 65x90@0 10x90@0 10x55@1
25x55@1 25x75@1 25x10@1 95x10@1


I don't use the first, it was my first attempt.  I use the second as my
minimize or iconify  button, and I use the last as my Maximize button. 
To me, these buttons offer a graphical representation of the action
which pressing them will perform.

I'll be posting a revised screenshot to my FVWM web page this afternoon
for those who'd like to see what these look like.

On 26 Sep 1996, I posted a patch to fix a problem with handling focus
on multiple screen systems.  The problem manifested itself when moving
the pointer from a window on e.g. screen 0 to the root window of
screen 1.  In these situations, screen 0 would still get focus.  See
my message of that date for details.

The fix was simple, I thought.  But then on 30 Sep 1996, Mark Boyns
followed up with a note that under SloppyFocus there were focus
problems with my patch.  Chuck subsequently did not install my patch
in 2.0.45.

I've just spent some time tracking all this down, and I now think that
Mark's problem has nothing to do with my patch (sorry Mark ;).  I
think the SloppyFocus problem exists in 2.0.45 with or without my
patch.  I'd like Mark (or any other multi-screener) to verify, but I
have been able to reproduce the problem from Mark's description with a
vanilla 2.0.45.  My patch does nothing to fix or hurt this, AFAICT.

I've also come to the conclusion that really good multi-screen support
is hopeless with the way FVWM currently handles multiple screens.  I
don't think there's any way for the screen 0 process to know what's
happening on screen 1 and vice versa.  And if you wanted SloppyFocus
to work correctly, it would have to do this:

    - when moving the pointer from a window in screen 0 to the root
      window in screen 1, the original window keeps focus

    - when subsequently moving the pointer to a window in screen 1, it
      gets focus and the original window loses focus.

    - when moving the pointer from a window in screen 0 to a window in
      screen 1, the new window gets focus and the original window
      loses it.

I don't think there's any way to do this because the screen 0 process
never gets EnterNotify events on screen 1, so it will never know
exactly when to de-focus the original screen.  It could be that there
are dark corners of X (or the FVWM sources :) that contain the answer,
but I can't find it, and can't really spend any more time on the
problem.  The ultimate fix is to do what ctwm does and *not* fork a
separate FVWM process for every screen.  That'll take a major effort I
think.

So, I'm reposting my patch (actually a little cleaner this time), and
hope Chuck will put it in the next version.  If not, I'll resign
myself to patching subsequent versions myself...

-Barry

Here's what I said on 30 Sept 1996:

    I just tried the patch and it only works a little better for me.  It
    seems to only do the right thing when there are no windows that accept
    focus on the second screen.  For example:

	screen0: nothing
	screen1: xterm
	screen2: nothing

    If I move the mouse out of the xterm on screen1 and onto screen2, the
    xterm cursor is no longer solid and focus appears to really be on
    screen2.  (I use sloppyfocus)

    But, if the screens are like this:

	screen0: nothing
	screen1: xterm
	screen2: xterm

    When I move the mouse out of the xterm on screen1 and onto the blank
    screen on screen2 (not touching the xterm on screen2), focus is still
    in the xterm on screen1.


I didn't mean to say that your patch introduced new problems, it only
slightly fixes the existing problem.

I say go ahead and include the patch.

Cool.  Yes, we should spend some effort getting FVWM to work better on
multiple screens.  Unfortunately the only multi-headed system I have
is here at work, and finding free time at work to hack on this isn't
easy. :-(

I definitely agree that we need better multi-screen support... preferably
in a fashion that doesn't require spawning a copy of fvwm2, FvwmAuto,
FvwmIconMan, FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, etc. FOR EACH SCREEN like it does
now. The ctwm window manager handles this very elegantly, and if we are
going to look anywhere for a "model" that is the place to do it. I'd be
happy to help test for sure, and even write code. I'm no eX11pert, but I
can hold my own when it comes to regular C programming...

Hi,

ctwm has MovePack and ResizePack which I quite like.  MovePack lets
you move a window `against' other windows.  Just like EdgeResistance
allows you to easily move a window against the screen edge, MovePack
allows you to easily move a window against other windows, because
these other windows offer a little `resistance' against moving.

ResizePack is the same function for resizing which allows you to
resize a window till it fills the available space.

Hi,

currently, if EdgeResistance is 50, I can't move a window 45 (for 1 <=
45 < 50) pixels off screen.  WIBNI Fvwm would recognize where I'm
coming from and possibly allow me to move the window 45 pixels off
screen even so?

Recipe: offer a resistance of 50 pixels for moving off screen, but if
the window is already off screen, allow it to be moved closer to the
edge than 50 pixels.  Currently, it snaps back completely on-screen
when I do that.

Kinda difficult to describe...

startsOnPage (semi-mythical by now) would also recognize a class instead of

True... but you did a good job.  :*)  I've wanted this very feature
several times.  This seems a very natural thing to want to do.  Give me
the resistance as I try and move the window out but let me slide it back
in to any degree.

Probably not ideal, but I think you can set up application specific
buttons, and only include those buttons for windows of the appropriate
type.  For example, the default buttons are 1, 2 and 4 with 1 (left
side) typically being the window operations menu, 2 being maximize and
4 being iconify.  You could, for example, set up buttons 3, 5, 7 and 9
to four different application specific functions, only using the
appropriate button for each of those four window types.  In each of
those window types, the inside button on the left side of the window
will run your application specific function.  You can decide for
yourself whether to decorate the buttons differently.  I can't think
of anything you can do for icons, though.

I think someone already suggested StickyIcon, but that won't do what
you want -- it'll open the window in your current page/desk when you
deiconify (yes, that's by design -- see TFM) whether the window itself
is sticky or slippery.  I think the best you can do now is use
FvwmIconBox to manage at least the netscape mail icon and make the
FvwmIconBox sticky, though I have to admit, I never tried using
FvwmIconBox for an active Icon.  I don't know if it would do the right
thing when mail arrived.

As someone else mentioned, a StartsOnPage directive has been on the
TODO list for quite some time now.  Unfortunately, it's a Style, and
there's no room for any more Styles until the Style flag mechanism is
rewritten.  In the mean time, if you are not using EdgeScroll, then
consider using separate Desks.  It took me a while to realize that I
nearly always had EdgeScroll turned off so now instead of using one
3x3 desktop, I use 9 1x1 desktops, set up FvwmPager to display them in
a 3x3 grid (*FvwmPagerRows 3) and I get the same look and feel I had
before, plus the ability to start applications on a given desk.  I
only occasionally miss being able to move windows among pages with the
mouse, but I can do that using FvwmPager, and there's also the
WindowsDesk function and temporarily making the window sticky.

(I'm not sure this is what you really want.)
You can use the "-geometry" option to start applications on a certain
page. It's not the most elegant way to do it, but it works for now.

Hi, 
	I apologize if this is a slight off topic, but I am looking for a
program that will tell me what key's are bound to what... On a sun
keyboard, I'd like to bind the Open and Front (L5 and L7) keys to
something (well... I already bound them, but...). If I didn't know which
keys they were actually (lets say it was an old keyboard and the
letterings all rubbed off or there was an explosion and all printed
letters fell off the keyboard or something drastic like that..), what
applications could I use to find the key bindings? I had seen a response
to a similar question which invoked a very simple keyboard program (not
xev), but I lost the mail (as this was a very long time ago) and cannot
recall the program. Thank you for any ideas.
	Also, I was wondering about something... I looked through the
documentation on creating functions... and I wanted to create one for
Button 1 on my windows that would perform similarly to the Windblows Title
Bar menu thingy. I wanted to be able to click once and get a menu, or
double click and close the window. Therefore I put the following in my
.fvwm2rc:

	AddToFunc Menu-or-Exit          "I" Menu Window-Ops
	+                               "D" Close

But it did not work. The menu would open, but on double click, the pointer
turned into a dot. I later found that the only way to properly close a
window on double click within the function, I had to either omit the menu,
or open the menu using "C" or "M" instead of "I". Seeing as how I didn't
want the user to have to depress the mouse button to get the menu, I ended
up with the following:

	AddToFunc Menu-or-Exit          "M" Menu Window-Ops
	+                               "D" Close

I was just curious... what is the reason that something like this wouldn't
work with "I" ?

Unfortunately, though, those geometries are relative to your current
page, so you have to be careful where you use them from.  If you have
a 3x3 desktop and are in page 2 2 (the lower right corner) and use a
geometry (assuming 1152x900 display) of +1152+0 to start on the top
middle page, you may be surprised...  Then again, it works quite
nicely for things started in InitFunction from which you (probably)
can assume the current page is 0 0.

Just using it  10 minutes ago.   You want Jamie Zawinski's "xkeycaps".
Any of the search engines should find it.

xsetroot -solid 'color'

I use 

DestroyFunc NewBackground

 -noqcheck -ncols 100 -max -smooth -quit ~/public_html/Pictures/* 
~/public_html/Pictures/hubble/* ~/public_html/Pictures/*/*/*"

all in one line.

this unpacks any jpeg, gif or other picture, expands it to screen size
installs it to the root window and quits.

this is REAL WORK for my workstation.
The picture appears after some time, but 'nice' takes care I can fully use
my WS inbetween.

Just a v. small contribution - an large X (I use it for close). It seems
to be less susceptible to looking daft as some do (when the angles are
wrong and you end up with non-45 degree lines).

Enjoy (for a short time anyway).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I trying to set up my fvwm2(.0.45) with a set of key bindings that
would allow me to cycle through windows on the current page with
Alt+Tab, and through windows _not_ on the current page with
Ctrl+Alt+Tab.  That way, I would be able to have one key sequence go
through all the windows that I can currently see (in theory, ones that
are related in some way), and a separate key sequence to switch to a
window not on the current page (e.g., I like to keep all my rlogin
xterms on one page, but sometimes I need to switch to them from a page
of 5 emacs frames and I don't want to have to cycle through windows
that are on the current page since I know they are not relevant).

Hope that was somewhat clear.

Anyway, I tried using the following Key binding to accomplish the
"switch to next not iconified window not on the current page" by using
something like:

Key Tab A MC Prev [!iconic !CurrentPage] Focus

which did not work.  Consulting the man page, it seems that there is
no "!CurrentPage" flag, so I am at a loss.

Any suggestions are welcomed.

I have the following pager setup:

*FvwmPagerBack #908090
*FvwmPagerFore #484048

As I defined MiniIcons, I commented out the SmallFont => the pager was very
instable.

It crashed with messages like:

Hello,

Is it OK to ask fvwm95 questions here?
Forgive my ignorance, I'm brand new to this list and don't want to
breach etiquette.

I'll proceed as if the answer is yes.

I switched from fvwm to fvwm95 a year or so ago (I like the taskbar).
I like the click-to-focus style, but not autoraise. I have played with
the startup file but cannot get rid of the autoraise feature. I've tried
using the FvwmAuto module with the delay set, I've tried not using the
FvwmAuto module, it doesn't make any difference. Whenever I click in a
window it immediately raises.

I'm currently running fvwm95-2.0.41f on a Red Hat linux 3.0.3 box.

Any pointers are appreciated.

Thanks, and sorry if this is the wrong forum.

Well, this list is about fvwm2 and as fvwm95 is developed seperately from
fvwm2, this is not the right place to ask such questions.

> I'll proceed as if the answer is yes.

I will to that too, although the answer is no.

I doubt this is possible with fvwm95. It is based on an older version of
fvwm2 and the thing you want was just added to fvwm2, known as
'ClickToFocusDoesntRaise'. So here comes the reason I'm replying to this
message: Use fvwm2! Now-a-days there's no reason left not to use it (if
you compare it with fvwm95). It can be easily hacked to look just like
Win95 (various examples on the 'net) and fvwm95's TaskBar has been
_ported_ to fvwm2 (http://www.donet.com/dmahurin/pub/). Back in the days
I used this TaskBar too, but now that I've _learned_ to use FvwmIconMan I
like it much more (and the TaskBar has gone).

Just give fvwm2 a try and I'm sure you'll love it! :)

Is this good enough? :)

'Sorry' accepted! But I sure hope, the next time you will ask questions
here, they'll be about fvwm2 instead of fvwm95. :)

Greetings,

comment out the line in the InitFunction:
Module FvwmAuto 500

Hello,

Is it OK to ask fvwm95 questions here?
Forgive my ignorance, I'm brand new to this list and don't want to
breach etiquette.

I'll proceed as if the answer is yes.

I switched from fvwm to fvwm95 a year or so ago (I like the taskbar).
I like the click-to-focus style, but not autoraise. I have played with
the startup file but cannot get rid of the autoraise feature. I've tried
using the FvwmAuto module with the delay set, I've tried not using the
FvwmAuto module, it doesn't make any difference. Whenever I click in a
window it immediately raises.

I'm currently running fvwm95-2.0.41f on a Red Hat linux 3.0.3 box.

Subject: FVWM: Thoughts about default XORValue
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.1

Hi all,

I've just compiled and installed fvwm-2.0.45 on our Solaris-Server
without any problems. It's getting better with every release !

I experienced the puzzling behaviour that the outlines of windows were
not drawn during resize or move operations on both 16 and 24 bpp
displays. Looking through the mailing list archives I found that the
reason is that the default XORValue for those "rubberbands" was
changed from 255 to 1, giving better results on 8bpp (correct me if
I'm wrong)

I think this is not a good idea: 

The old value was fine (maybe not perfect) for _all_ kinds of
depths. At least it worked. If one of our users found it
insufficiently (nobody ever did) she could have easily set the value
herself. At our site we have the policy to give users a set of
dotfiles with the promise, that they can get their work done if they
leave them as they are. These files are minimal, without bells and
whistles. If users fiddle with them, they're on their own.
With our "minimal" .fvwmrc they can run the WM, if they want to
explore its features they have to RTFM.

I understand that this release is still considered beta, so I can't
rely on backward compatibility. But to change the default for XORValue
means to introduce the necessity to configure another option in
.fvwm(2)rc. My personal point of view is that it should be possible to
provide a _minimal_ "one size fits all"-configuration.

(Btw: Is the system-wide configuration-file still -as the Manpage
says- /.../.fvwmrc ?? I remember a discussion in this group about
changing it to /.../fvwmrc or /.../system.fvwmrc, so it would not be a
hidden file anymore)

Regards

   Martin Trampler

The problem here is in focus.c; the attached patch fixes it to have
the desired behaviour.

Fvwm 2.0.45 (not fvwm95!) groks a global option that does this:

    GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntRaise

You can configure fvwm 2.0.45 to look pretty much like Win95.  The
newest version of FvwmIconMan can do everything the taskbar can except
for the start menu.  But you can create an FvwmButtons module with an
FvwmIconMan in it and a button that pops up a menu, and there you are.

Hm.  I use the following and it works nicely:

| Mouse 0	1    	A      	Menu Window-Ops Close

Can you adapt this for your situation?

One of my users wishes to have windows automatically raise when she moves
the mouse into them.  This sounds like FvwmAuto to me, so I tried
experimenting with it.  the result was the error:

FvwmAuto requires one arugument.

The syntax: (in my module menu definition)

+       "FvwmAuto"      Module FvwmAuto 200 raise lower

I can't comprehend what is going wrong here...

Try simply having:
+	"FvwmAuto" 	Module FvwmAuto 200 


Like the error said, FvwmAuto only needs one argument.

In my init function I have the line:
+	"I" 		Module FvwmAuto 150

This is what you want. Starting it off a menu every
session is inconvenient.

Yes, that works... current problem solved.  

HOWEVER - this brings up the issue that according to the man page and
definition of FvwmAuto, you can have an optional additional two arguments
that will execute any valid operation on the window you're now in.  Like,
raise on enter and iconify on leave (Module FvwmAuto 0 raise iconify) - Why
does this feature not work?

I understand about starting it every session - I just testing at this point.

Ah, sorry. I misunderstood your question (I'd forgotten about the other params to
be honest). I assumed you were just having a 'Doh!' day and had misread the man
page or something.

I've just tried
+ 	"I"	Module FvwmAuto 150 Nop Iconify

and while it was very confusing (it uniconfied icons when I moved over them
for example) it worked fine.

Maybe its simply being very picky in syntax,
'raise'/'Raise'? 

I'd test it more but its time I went home!

It doesn't work for me... I get the same error again.

Why would I get that error?

I was wondering if it is possible to have the taskbar pop up a menu
when it is clicked such that the actions in the menu affect the window that
the taskbar refers to, not the actual task bar window. I tried this:

  AddToMenu "Window-Ops2" "&Kill" Destroy
  *FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 PopUp Window-Ops2

But, the Destory even is apparently being sent to the actual TaskBar, not
the window that the TaskBar refers to. Is it possible to change that?

I am using fvwm95-2 if that matters...

Thanks!

Hm, there is a newer version of FvwmIconMan at
ftp.cs.arizona.edu:/people/bradym.  It doesn't grow horizontally, but
you can tell it to have a certain geometry.  When more buttons for
more windows are added, the existing buttons shrink horizontally to
make room for the new buttons.  Isn't this the behavior of the Win95
taskbar, too?

Btw, because of the set geometry, it is possible to put FvwmIconMan
into FvwmButtons.

FvwmIconMan, from ftp.cs.arizona.edu:/people/bradym, does this.  You
can combine it with FvwmButtons to create something that's pretty much
like the taskbar.

I hope that this request could be considered.

after using CDE for a while (I had no choice and have now resolved this) I find that it would be preferable to have a .fvwm directory in home that contains fvwmrc rather than the present situation.

it would be nice if fvwm seached first for $HOME/.fvwmrc
then $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc

and if the second was the case, then set an internal variable FVWMHOME to $HOME/.fvwm

this would make the spliting of a monlithic fvwmrc file an easier task both for users and administrators!

for instance each user would only have to create a .fvwm directory and copy a style file to change the colours of windows.
all other settings would remain unaffected and under the control of the administrator.

the present behaviour would be unaffected and I'm sure the change would require little overhead or code bloating.

We do something similar already here, using the standard .fvwm2rc, 
but using it as a very small file that reads site files:

----------- example .fvwm2rc start -------------------

Read /home/nav2/fvwm.extras

----------- example .fvwm2rc end -------------------

Any changes can either be made in the users fvwm.extras file, or
they can copy any of the other files and change their .fvwm2rc to
point to the right place.

You can  get  this without change  to  fvwm2 by starting  fvwm2 with a
shell  that supplies the -f argument  to fvwm2.  In  the shell you can
even create the $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc files that you  want for first time
users.

old versions. now one to three args are ok.

from the code: (last version, I submitted)

    if(argc < 7 || argc > 9)
    {
	fprintf(stderr,"FvwmAuto for fvwm-" VERSION " can use one to three arguments.\n");
	exit(1);
    }

so you must have an old version around.
maybe check your ModulePath (did you compile 2.0.45 locally and is
there a global path still in your ModulePath ?

No. it sends the command to fvwm for execution and fvwm2 isn't picky
at all (strcasecmp's)

mee too.

as I said: old version. (maybe check your ModulePath)

ModulePath /usr/local/tools/X11/fvwm:/users/lchang/tools/X11/fvwm

For some reason the FvwmAuto in the lchang directory was being run instead
of the one local.  I switched them around with the same result, switched
them back and it worked.  Go figure.  That's a computer for you.

  Having experienced a similar problem in Wine we've settled on
  the 

  (WhitePixelOfScreen(screen) ^ BlackPixelOfScreen(screen))

  for GXxor invert. It works as expected in TrueColor and reasonably
  good in PseudoColor. I'd suggest to use this as the default XORValue
  with .fvwmrc entry overriding it if necessary.

I think people have misunderstood my post. I know it is possible to split the file, and I do this myself, however I think that it could be made much easier.
as it stands at the moment, fvwm looks first for .fvwmrc, if this fails
it then looks for system.fvwmrc 

what I would like changed is
1/it looks for $HOME/.fvwmrc
2/(if fail) looks for $HOME/.fvwm/fvwmrc
3/then system.fvwmrc


if 2  then: Read file
would search first in $HOME/.fvwm then in the system directory

if 3 then: Read file
would search first in $HOME/.fvwm then in the system directory


at present all you can do is have the system file read and then overwrite these options in your $HOME/.fvwm/file

basically what I suggest is that fvwm config files reside in a hiden directory so that they don't clutter the home directory and that the config is split into files so that users can simply copy and change the file relevant to what they want.

this sort of exists except that the read command always searches the $HOME directory and the system settings remain unless the user specifically overrides them explicitly.

I've been using fvwm on my SGI for two weeks now and I like it alot. I
have a couple of questions which I hope you folks can help me with:

*) I had a very hard time deciding between Afterstep and Fvwm. Finally
   I decided to go for Fvwm's functional superiority and try to get it
   to look at least as good as Afterstep. One thing I'm missing though
   is wharf. I know there's FvwmButtons but it's not quite the same.
   Is there any mdule for Fvwm that resembles wharf more?

*) I made myself a nice decor that uses VGradient for the titlebar. I
   would like to do the same for the small block of text below the
   icons and maybe also for menus, but it doesn't seem to be possible,
   or is it? If not, why? Since the rendering code is already there for
   titlebars, I guess it wouldn't take much code to allow the same for
   other parts.

Cheers,
-Ives

it would be nice to convert wharf to fvwm or to add wharf's functionallity to
fvwmbuttons.

is there somewhere that the module interface system is explained, preferably
with code examples?

There has been some private discussion between me and Andrew Veliath on
this. It would be a logical addition. I'd like to see a library where modules
can use that code as well (mmm, gradients in my FvwmButtons). It's not a small
job though.

Hi,

I'm a former vtwm user, and I'm now using fvwm 2.0.45, with 
FvwmPager and 
FvwmIconMan.  One of the nice features of vtwm (or at least the 
version I was using) was that if I deiconified something from the 
Icon Manager, it would show up on whatever my current screen was, 
instead of in the screen that it was on originally.  This behavior 
was configurable with the "DeIconifyToScreen" parameter.  I often used
this to move a window from another screen to my current one.

Is there a similar parameter in FVWM or FvwmIconMan so that when I 
click on the icon in the Icon Manager the window shows up in the 
current page?

Thanks,

Sam Kamens

If you specify

Style "*" StickyIcon

Then deiconifies will open the window on your current screen.  Of
course with Style, you can limit that to specific window types if you
want.

Many thanks to those who responded to my original query.

Thimio was right! I've made the switch and I'm extremely happy with my
fvwm2 setup. I really appreciate the help that you all have provided.

Is there any way to make fvwm and/or fvwm95 be aware of dialogs within
Xview applications that have the peggable feature?

I am a newcomer to fvwm, and I am installing fvwm under SunOS 4.1.4.
Compilation and linking appeared to go fine, however, when I attempt to
run fvwm I get the following error:
    ld.so: Undefined symbol: _sys_nerr
I would appreciate any suggestions, so I could get fvwm up and running.
Thanks.

I went through the same search and finally found something that works (I
think its a bug, but I sure would love NOT to see it fixed; I mean that :-)

I use FvwmWinList and have configured mouse 3 to deiconify and move the window
which in turn gives focus to it on my current desk.

    *FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, move

BTW: In fvwm2.0.43 you could actually just Focus on the window without
     moving it which would relocate the window to your current desk, but
     it seems as though that "feature" does not work on 2.0.45

    *FvwmWinListAction Click3 Iconify -1, focus

Regardless, I agree that it would be really useful to have a
"DeIconifyToCurrentDesk" switch that could be incorporated to *Action lists.

Hope that helps.

I have built it for solaris 2.5.1. It compiles just fine and seems to install just
fine. The window manager does come up, but that is about it. I cannot move or 
resize and of the windows. This is the first time I have done anything with
fvwm2, so it might a the way I am starting the window manager. 

Any ideas.
