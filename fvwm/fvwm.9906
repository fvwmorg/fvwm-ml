Is there an alternate site from where I can download fvwm ? I've been trying
to get fvwm 
since last week, and the download site is not reachable.

	Not quite correct, to do what you wanted. Your -xrm option doesn't
specify a page, just a desk. To override the config file setting, you
have to specify a page; not specifying one indicates that you don't care
what page is used, and that FVWM should place the window on whichever
page it had already decided to use - in this case, the one erroneously
specified in the config file. To override it the way you wanted, you'd
need to specify -xrm "*Page: 3 0 0" (since you use a 1x1 desktop, you're
always using page 0,0).

	Is there a command I can use for shutdown from a Popup menu?
For instance, change the Quit command to execute shutdown -h now?

In the "Screen Definition" settings set the "Window Manager:" field to
either "X" or "Default to native" and Exceed will then let a window
manager manage the X windows.  There are lots of ways to start fvwm, it
is just another client that needs $DISPLAY setting.  You can start it
from an xterm or you can get the Exceed Client Startup Wizard to start
fvwm.

I just downloaded this from another site(shouda checked 1st I think).

Your ftp site lists 2.3.2 as a 'test' version. The other site (CNET) did
not specify this as a test version.

My Question:
Should I get the 2.2 RELEASED version instead, or will the 2.3.2 version
work alright?
I am currently using the 2.0.46 version under SuSE Linux.

Thank you
Bill L

Then they screwed up; FVWM releases are numbered like Linux kernel
releases: if the second digit is odd, don't use it unless you like your
software broken.  If it's even, it's stable.

Well, if you like alpha-quality development software, feel free to stick
with 2.3.2.  But if you want it to work then get 2.2.2.

Has anyone suggested to the CNET site that they should correct their site
otherwise you guys are going to have more people than you want using the
2.3.x series :)

I'm not sure if this is possible, but you should be able to change your
.login, .xinitrc and .logout files to automatically shutdown your machine
when you come out of X windows.

Hope it helps.

Hello,
I have used FVWM in the past on a Solaris box, but would
like to set it up on my SGI machine.  I have an R10000
Octane running IRIX 6.5.  I would be very grateful if you
could tell me exactly how to get FWM running.  That is,
do I have to have a .xsession file and what do I need to
put in there etc.  Also, any tips you might have on compiling
on an SGI would be appreciated as well. Are there pre-compiled
binaries out there somewhere?  I thank you in
advance for your help and look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Ashish

Hi all,

on fvwm-2.2.2 on Digital UNIX I've got a small but annoying problem:  Amaya
(the w3-consortiums html editor) doesn't get any window decorations.  I've
got the usual

	Style "*"           BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5
	Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm, Color Black/#40a0c0
	Style "*"           ActivePlacement, SmartPlacement
	Style "*"           MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride
	Style "*"           DecorateTransient,IconBox 0 -10 -280 -1

and this works for all other windows.  fvwm v2.0.46 exibited exactly the
same behaviour.  Anyone got an idea?

I've noticed that the name of the window, as returned by xwininfo depends
on the document being edited, but the 'style "*" ...' directive shouldn't
be bothered by this, should it?

confused in Munich,

Rob Urban

Typically, I'd suspect that a style directive that strips the
decorations is accidentally applying to Amaya windows... What are the
strings matching name, icon, resource and class, as reported by
FvwmIdent or xwininfo? See if any of these strings will match a style
line in your .fvwm2rc stripping away decorations, as would commonly be
found applying to things like "*clock*" or "Fvwm*".

Outside of that, I haven't any suggestions. Anyone else running this
and have different results to report?

Name, Icon Name, and Resource are all the same, namely

	AmayaPage.html Formatted_view

Class is

	Dialogue

Any ideas?

To be able to shutdown form a menu in fvwm I use sudo for my user account
then I added this in my .fvwmrc.  With this I get prompted for my
password in a rxvt term before a Reboot or complete shutdown occurs.  

Popup	   "Shutdown"
Title	   "Shutdown"
Exec	   "Reboot!!!" exec rxvt -T Reboot!!! -geometry 40x2+262+332 -n sudo -e sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now &
nop
Exec	   "Close!!!" exec rxvt -T Close!!! -geometry 40x2+262+332 -n sudo -e sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now &
EndPopup

Chow,

Dominic.

Well, I just commented out every style command except for those I listed
earlier.  No change.

How about the Style lines from your rcfile?

Nothing here is very obviously an unintentional substring match to
popular non-decorated styles.

Hey, 2.3.2 is not *this* bad. It has a few quirks, but is quite stable.
A drawback of the odd numbered releases is that no guarantees are made
that the syntax of new commands will be the same in the next release.
However, unless you need a specific feature of 2.3.2 urgently you
should use 2.2.2.

Simply put a command like this in your .xinitrc or .xsession
file (whichever your system uses):

  fvwm2 <options>

or

  exec fvwm2 <options>

or

  fvwm2 &
  ... (more commands)

Note that X will exit when the last application started from
this file exits.

Does this work with older fvwm versions? Doe is work with other window
managers? If both answers are no, could you use 'xwininfo -all' on such
a window to find out if the 'Override Redirect' property is set?
(You should get a line saying 'Override redirection?: Yes/No'.

Well, perhaps I was overstating the point to drive it home.  But it is
important for all users to know that you really shouldn't be using
development releases unless you're willing to actually help folks develop
them.  That includes reporting bugs (i.e. giving good bug reports) and if
at all possible joining the fvwm-workers list.

'xwininfo -all' returns

Here is the entire output of xwininfo -all:

Hrm, looks ok. Can you start this application with a different name and see
if that helps? Or perhaps if you set a specific style for "amaya*"?

Well, that depends on what OS you are using and what program
draws the box. If you need to log in as a different user to
do the shutdown this is a problem.

well quicky question here.
I kinda like WindowMakers idea of reorginizing the icons in an icon box when
you move one out of the stack.  Well I noticed that recapute does this. 
However as can be expected it doesn't work as well as I'd like it to, eg when
there is an time when I want it to do what I stuck it in for it works just
fine.  But when I don't really need it it changes the order windows I have open
and usually ends up hiding the one I just deiconified.  Now I'm sure I read
something about reordering icons in the man page awhile ago but I am using the
latest cvs version and I can't find it anywhere if it is a feature at all.  So
basicly my question is there a better way to do this or should I just live with
one or the other?

Also bonus question.  I prefer to use icons rather then taskbar ot the like. 
However I can't quite find icons that I like most times as the shaped looks
nice but isn't terribly functional.  I assume there is no way to get fvwm to
stick some kind of tile back on the icons as per window maker style.  So I have
to taken to making my own icons with tiled backs on them.  I have yet to
incorperate this into my themes setup as I'm pretty sure loading a new style
file with different icons names will work here.  But do I have to make
different names for all of them or can I just set a new imagepath in the new
style file?  And also is there an easier way to go about this icon tile back
then what way I'm doing, like a script or something so I can quickly make new
themes?

If you've been  on the mailing lists for  a while, you might have seen
recent discussion   of an enhancement   request along these  lines.  I
think I was in favor  of moving it  to "enchancement unlikely", partly
because I'd only   seen one request  for  the feature.    Its still in
"enhancements" as #124.

I read your comments as "I can sort of live without  it, but if it was
there I would use it"?

This is enhancement request #39 in our bug tracking system.

I tried commenting *all* other 'Style' lines out except for the five above
and restarting fvwm and amaya.  no change.

If I run amaya under another name I get exactly the same behavior.

I suppose I could re-compile fvwm with some debug options and then get
a better idea of what's going on by analyzing some log?

I compiled amaya 2.0a last night from sources, linked against lesstif
0.88. When I run it under fvwm (I think I'm running 2.2, but it's so
hard to remember), it's properly decorated...

I sent a message detailing this problem a couple weeks ago, but it seems
it never got through and I was gone for a while, so here is my problem
again:

In both 2.3.2 and snapshot 990521 (I think), the last two I had the chance
to download, I had a problem with windows being lost upon Restart ("Read
.fvwm2rc").  I could see them in the Pager, and they were always in the
page just below the one I was in, following me around the desk.  Even if I
specified these windows to be non-sticky and restarted (with "Read
.fvwm2rc"), they still followed me around the desk.  (Is this a bug, too?)

I found that the windows that did this were precisely those windows that
had negative geometries (at least in the Y-direction).  My setup is not
fancy--I just run a bunch of little iconic programs (Sticky) along the top
of the screen.  Since some of them have shaped icons, in order to fit them
nicely, I have to start them wita h negative Y-direction position, e.g.

program_name -geometry 50x50+400-3

These windows with a negative position argument are the ones that
"disappear" to the page below the current page when I call "Restart"
(which again is "Read .fvwm2rc").  I did not see this problem in 2.2.x. 
The only workaround I know of is to quit fvwm, and log back into X.

Anyway, as I am not sitting in front of my Linux box right now, I can't
give a more detailed report.  I'm recalling this from memory, but I think
I got everything straight.  If more info is needed (e.g. the contents of
.fvwm_restart), please contact me.  Oh, and keep up the good work.  :-)

-jason

p.s.  Sorry if this was noticed and fixed.  Like I said, I have not had a
chance to download and try newer snapshots.

If I use the mouse to launch the menus, they work fine.  But, if I use the
keyboard shortcuts (Alt-F{1,2,3}) to activate the menus, when I navigate
to the other entries in the menu (via the arrow keys), the top entry in
each menu (and sub-menu, IIRC) remains either fully-highlighted or gets
"separated" from the rest of the entries by a line that is the same color
as the highlight color.  This happens in 2.3.2.  I didn't try it on
snap-19990521, the latest snap I could grab.  I know it didn't happen in
2.2.x.

Thanks,

2.3.2 is ancient history by now.

If you want to test alphas, (any 2.3.x release), you should subscribe
to and report problems on the fvwm-workers list.

2.3.2 is a particularly unfortunate version for reporting menu drawing
bugs. Nearly every line of the drawing code has been completely rewritten
between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 :-) Could you verify that with a current development
snapshot? Don't use 2.3.3 - the cursor key navigation is broken there.

Why couldn't you grab any more recent snapshots?  They are built nightly
and the one you have is over two weeks old.

Hi,

I have been enjoying fvwm2 with sounds for a long while with Slackware Linux.
But now I turned to Red Hat 5.2. Since then I could not make fvwmaudio work
with fvwm2.

I exercised many combinations, fvwm2.0.46 + standard sound system; 
fvwm2.0.46 + OSS sound, fvwm2.2.2 + OSS. The result is a core dump when
loading
the module, the error seems to be Segmentation fault.

The problem is the same with FvwmEvent.

Are you aware of a problem or did I forget something?

I have seen that in the archives, notification # 156 depicts the same problem,
but I could not find the answer.

Thanks in advance

Jacques

PS 'play' works fine directly on files, but xmailbox does not provide sound.

Looking back, that sentence is confusing.  I meant to say that I moved,
and that was the latest snap available when I canceled my net access.  
Right now, I'm nowhere near my Linux box, and it's really inconvenient for
me to download fvwm on the Windows machine here, run it over to my Linux
box, and test it out.

I had originally submitted bug reports within a day of 19990521, but they
never got through, it seems.  I figured that it might be worthwhile to
re-report 2-week old bugs, in case I was the only one to notice & report
them.

Anyway, since the development pace seems to be very rapid, I'll keep to
myself until I get net access from my Linux box.  Then, I will play with
the latest snaps and let you all know if I see anything funky.  :-)

Can you try that with 2.3.3 (2.3.3 is an alpha release, don't use
it except for testing)? If the problem persiste, can you send us a
stack trace? To get one, do this:

  # gdb fvwm2 core
  (gdb) where

Note that there is no FvwmAudio module in 2.3.3 any more. It has been replaced
with a shell script that calls FvwmEvent in a 'FvwmAudio compatibility mode'.

Ah, OK; as the one who makes sure those archives are up, I just wanted to
make sure that there wasn't any kind of screwup that prevented those files
from being available.

I really dont know what I'm talking about, but using redhat linux(well
the ppc port)
when I try to play xgalaga I dont get any sounds except when I'm
root.(because it needs read write permisions to /dev/dsp.. any ways
mabey Fvwm needs read write permitions to an audio device ?

Dominik,

Thank you for your fast answer. I downloaded the 2.3.3 version and the result
is very different. I don't get a core file and the FvwmEvent keeps running.
But I don't get no sound and the play program appears as zombie in the ps
list.

Maybe it could be a  configuration error. Here is my .fvwm2rc file


*FvwmEventCmd myplay
*FvwmEventDelay 0
*FvwmEvent startup 		start.au
*FvwmEvent shutdown 		cannot.be.completed.au
*FvwmEvent unknown 		crash.au
*FvwmEvent add_window 		gong.au
*FvwmEvent raise_window 	door_open.au
... ...
AddToMenu AudioSettings 
+ "Event mapping" 			FvwmForm AudioEvents
+ "FvwmEvents"				Module FvwmEvent

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec /usr/bin/play /usr/share/sound/$1


Here is what I get in the log file

sox: Type AUTO input must be a file, not a pipe
sox: Type AUTO input must be a file, not a pipe
sox: Type AUTO input must be a file, not a pipe
sox: Type AUTO input must be a file, not a pipe
sox: Type AUTO input must be a file, not a pipe
... ...

I think it  is very close to make it work!!!

What do you suggest?

Cheers

Jacques

I think this is a configuration error.

Note that the first variable of a function is represented in AddToFunc
as $0. See 'man fvwm2' in the section for AddToFunc. Anyway, try
replacing $1 above with $0. Currently you're trying to play a
directory, I believe.

Thank you Mike!!

That's right, with $0 it works. 

The point is that I use version 2.3.3 which is not stable.

Do I have to wait till it is stable or is there a version between 2.2.2 and
2.3.3 which works?

Thanks again

Jacques

No. 2.2.2 is the latest 'stable' version. But you might try to use the
FvwmEvent executable of 2.3.3 and run it under 2.2.2. That *might* work.

	Ok.. I have a program that will let me log in as root and
perform commands.  Question is should this syntax work in the
fvwm2rc.menus.m4 file as an Exec?  

	Exec progx root shutdown -h now

	'progx root shutdown -h now' works fine from the user prompt,
but it does not from the .m4 file.

		Well, that depends on what OS you are using and what
program

to

Re: fvwm

I'm wondering how I can get two of the same programs running on one 
GoodStuff menu.  I read in the man page that this may (or will) present a 
conflict, and only the last conflicting program will be invoked.

Here's what I mean:

*GoodStuff -	whatever   Swallow "xbiff" ssh -f hostName_1 
		/usr/openwin/bin/xbiff
		-file /var/spool/mail/username -update 15 -rv -g -1500-1500 &

*GoodStuff -    whatever   Swallow "xbiff" ssh -f hostName_2
		/usr/local/X11/bin/xbiff
		-file /var/spool/mail/username -update 15 -rv -g -1500-1500 &

In this case, there will be one blank box, and one containing the second
call to xbiff.

Goal:  to have both running.

I tried many different approaches, but can't seem to get it.

Please help !   There must be a way.

Jacques,

I was wondering if I might ask you just a few more questions regarding how
you got around this problem.  You see I'm trying not to stray too far from
using the Red Hat Package Manager, in hopes to simplify my life in the
future when things (inevitibly) go wrong.  My questions are simple.  I
take it you compiled the recent fvwm2-2.2.2 release. Did you install the
files by hand or did you find the install paths set up properly, allowing
you to just execute the install command?  Did you try using the
FvwmEvent module from version 2.2.2?  You sent around a section of your
.fvwm2rc file, and I assume that is m4 processed output.  Which m4 files
did you choose to modify?  Any thing else you might choose to tell me to
simplify the install??

Thanks,
Tom

Ps.  Sorry for such simple questions, but I'm new to maintaining my own
Linux box...

Jacques, really what you're doing shouldn't be necessary. If I recall
your .fvwm2rc correctly, you're calling FvwmEvent explicitly, not
trying to recycle legacy FvwmAudio config. Try 2.2.2's FvwmEvent.
Hopefully it will work properly with your .fvwm2rc.

Thomas, you had a question about the interaction with the M4 files on
your RedHat system. Take a look at the FVWM FAQ, which addresses this
question.

It should work. Does it help if you put the command line in a shell
script and call this instead (don't forget to make it executable)?
If not, try to start a FvwmConsole window (from your config file)
and type the command there. Do you get any error messages?

Bye

Thomas,

Michael's mail gave the answer. i confirm it works with fvwm2.2.2 event
module. It was actually a configuration problem. The difference between the
2.2.2 and 2.3.3 is that the former dumps core with no explanations when there
is a configuration problem although the latter keeps running.

The result is that now I use the 2.2.2 package as is. So far I did not compile
it as root and did not install it as root, I installed it on my home directory
(using ./configure --prefix=<myhomedir>).

One reason is that I run rpm version 2.0.46, the one provides with RedHat 5.2.
The 2.2.2 was grabbed from fvwm.org

I am using the Nextlevel M4  RedHat package. I have just put the fvwmEvent
instructions in .fvwm2rc.modules here thay are:
######################FvwmEvent###########################################
##### FvwmEvent
#*FvwmEventDir SOUND_DIR
#*FvwmEventCmd SOUND_COMMAND
*FvwmEventCmd myplay
*FvwmEventDelay 0
# User must add a new column to each line below, specifying
# a sound file from SOUND_DIR (define-d in .fvwm2rc-defines)
*FvwmEvent startup 		start.au
*FvwmEvent shutdown 		cannot.be.completed.au
*FvwmEvent unknown 		crash.au
*FvwmEvent add_window 		gong.au

*FvwmEvent string		jackhammer-short.au
*FvwmEvent mini_icon		hi.au
*FvwmEvent windowshade		hammer.au
*FvwmEvent dewindowshade	cuckoo.au

I put the following lines in .fvwm2rc.init:

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec /usr/local/ltcbin/rugplay /usr/share/sound/$0

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent

And I disabled sound events in .fvwm2rc.defines:
# define(`WANT_SOUND_EVENTS')

Cheers

Jacques

I think what you should do is to choose a different directory for
installing your own programs.  If you choose one directory per
program, it is very simple to delete the program afterwards.  If you
include the version number in the directory, you can even install two
versions of the same program, try them both, and when you have decided
which one to use, delete the other one.

One of the steps in compiling and installing fvwm is to run the
configure script.  You can just tell it where you want your fvwm to be
installed.  Suppose you decide to install your own software in
/usr/sw, then the following will install fvwm 2.2.3:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/sw/fvwm/2.2.3 <<other configure args>>
        make
        make install

This will create a directory /usr/sw/fvwm/2.2.3/bin which you need to
add to $PATH: export PATH=/usr/sw/fvwm/2.2.3/bin:$PATH.  Similar for
/usr/sw/fvwm/2.2.3/man and $MANPATH.

That's it!

Installing a new version 2.3.1 is as simple as giving the right
directory name to configure.  Deleting a version is as simple as "rm
-rf /usr/sw/fvwm/2.2.3".

this approach works best with a depot program, for example opt_depot. then all
you need is to set the default path to somewhere like /usr/local/bin. the depot
program should then take care of linking the program to the correct locations

This sounds like RedHat. From the FVWM FAQ, which probably would be in
/usr/doc/fvwm2-2*/FAQ on your filesystem, or at
http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/FAQ.html, you can find the following text:

3.1  I use FVWM on a RedHat Linux system and can't figure out how to
     change my FVWM configuration.  I've read the FVWM manpage but when
     I edit my .fvwm2rc nothing seems to happen.  What's going on?

A: RedHat Linux installs the X server accompanied (by default) by a
   configuration management system.  In earlier releases it was called
   TheNextLevel and in more recent releases it's called AnotherLevel.
   For further information about TheNextLevel, consult RedHat's
   documentation in /usr/doc/TheNextLevel/.  For information about
   AnotherLevel, do a 'man AnotherLevel'.

I must be jinxed...  
Performing the same chages listed below, and substituting for the sound
playing program as 

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec /usr/local/bin/play /usr/share/sound/$0

I've also tried substituting wavplay (the sound files are .wav files) with
the same result.

I still get a core dump.  What's worse, the FvwmEvent man pages suggest
simple examles of using FvwmEvent, like echo-ing a string to the terminal.
Even this simple example from the man pages causes a core dump for me.  Is
it possible I'm missing something big? or even little...  I should say
that I'm trying this with fvwm2.2.046 and fvwm2.2.2

I'm going to dig through the FAQ again now for some simple examples of
using FvwmEvent, can anyone think of some which might be indicative of the
problem I'm having?  

Thanks,

Hi,

Do you know of a way to have access to a drag and drop feature with fvwm2?
I mean the feature found on Windows, and possibly on Motif, to grasp a file or
program and drop it onto the desktop ground?

Is it planned to be included in a future version or is there an additional
program that deals with it?

Cheers

Jacques

Hi all,

I am using FVWM on my Sun/Solaris on top of CDE and I can't get it to
recognize the META key for key modifiers. SHIFT and CONTROL work, but not
META. Any one see this before, and know how to get it to work?

Thanks,

-doug

I'm not familiar with the terminology, "fvwm on top of CDE".
Either fvwm is running or dtwm is running.

What version of fvwm2?

What do your keybindings look like?

Which key on your keyboard do you think is the Meta key.  My Meta key
has a diamond on it.

This works for me in all recent versions of fvwm2:

Key F1 A M Maximize 0 100

It dumps core with 2.0.46 and with 2.2.2? My first suspicion is to ask
you what your ModulePath is defined as in .fvwm2rc. Note that the
behavior of the builtin ModulePath changed between 2.0 and 2.2. It's a
bit odd that 2.0.46's Event is coring, but maybe there's a third
version of Event that's causing trouble... To sum up, make sure that
you're not trying to run the wrong version of Event, since it makes a
distinct difference... not necessarily between 2.2 and 2.3, but
definitely between 2.0 and 2.2.

Other than that, you could always do the following:

1) Figure out which FvwmEvent you think you're running
2) do a 'gdb $fvwmeventpath'
3) in gdb, 'core core' (assuming you're in the directory containing
the FvwmEvent core)
4) 'where'
5) catch that output and send it to the bug tracking system or to
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org

Ah, sorry.. more details:

My Sun has the CDE junk on it so it comes up with that standard login
screen... in other words, when you reboot your Sun it comes up with a GUI
login screen. You can adjust your .xinitrc to start FVWM and so that is how
I am running FVWM on CDE (I think that login screen is part of CDE).

The funny thing is, I had my FVWM working fine on another Sun w/o the CDE
stuff and the META (diamond) key worked fine there... so I think it has
something to do with CDE but don't know how to disable it.

I don't know how this works on a Sun, but on my AIX (over a year in the past
now) you could disable the graphiical login by removing the 'dtlogin'
(or something else beginning with 'dt') from your /etc/inittab and then
starting X manually. As root you might as well 'kill' the process (use
ps to get a list of processes with names beginning with 'dt' and kill them
one by one :) ).

Look at the output of 'xmodmap -pm'. Is there an entry mapping
mod1 to your meta key? If not you should ajust your key mappings
with the xmodmap command (see man page).

Drag-and-drop is way out of the responibilities of a window manager. Dtwm,
the window manager supplied for CDE doen't know about d&d either. It's the
'desktop environment' that provides the functionality. Fvwm knows nothing
about programs or files and thus could not know what to do with them.
Fvwm might be a *client* for d&d that can receive *objects* dropped into
it. In general, the d&d you will find on any UNIX isn't very sophisticated.
CDE has d&d, but it's limited to the few applications that are CDE aware
(i.e. the ones that are supplied with CDE and perhaps a few others). KDE
is said to get a very advanced d&d interface in the future (2.0 release).
I don't know about GNOME, but I suppose it's similar.

No, there are no such plans. If someone wrote a module for this I'd be
willing to include it, but I don't believe anybody will do it before
it's clear how the future of d&d will look in the UNIX world (KDE? GNOME?
will KDE and GNOME agree on a common interface? Something completely
different?).

Thomas,

For me it is even stranger, Michael asked me to reproduce the core dump, the
funny thing is that I am not able to reproduce it!!!

When I put back the $1 instead of $0 it just stop working but does not dumps
although I have been bothered with these dumps all the time!!!

What I can say now is "I'm sorry I can't make it stop working!" I suppose I
have been doing something else in between than I can't remember. I am pretty
sure of the configuration files I gave you.

BTW are you sure the play program is on /usr/local/bin and not on /usr/bin in
the Red Hat distribution?

I believe Michael and Dominik are going to be much more helpful than I can be.

Cheers

Jacques

This is changing rapidly.  Version 4 of the XDND protocol has been
published and most of the major toolkits support it: Qt, GTK+ (1.2),
etc. support it so KDE and Gnome will, as do some other tools.  XEmacs
is going to support it in the 22.x versions.  StarOffice says they will
in 6.0.

So, it shouldn't be too long before you can drag and drop between all
these different apps--that's exciting.

  http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~jafl/xdnd/

They do list icewm and Window Maker as "window managers that use XDND",
but it's not entirely clear to me what that means.  I can see modules
like FvwmButtons and FvwmWinList making use of it, certainly.

Perhaps the window manager is the client to receive d&d objects.
The action would be to place an icon on the desktop. But I can't
imagine what the window manager should do when a file is dropped
into it (i.e. what application it should start). In fvwm there
should be a module to handle d&d, I think.

Hi Jacques

As others have already noted, drag and drop (dnd) falls outside the
remit of a window manager. However, it is currently available through
both the Gnome and KDE desktop environments. Gnome supports the Xdnd
and Motif protocols, and I believe KDE at least supports Xdnd,
possibly others (any KDE-heads out there with this info?).
You can read about Gnome dnd at http://www.gnome.org/white-papers/DND/DND/.

I believe Gnome should run on the major unices. If you're using
linux then RedHat 6.0 comes with both Gnome and KDE set up by
default. Most current linux distributions should have one or the
other or both.

At the moment I'm running fvwm2 and Gnome quite happily together,
and have dnd working even though fvwm isn't gnome-compliant yet.
I think someone is working on this in the current development
tree ... what's the current status of this, guys?

See
  http://www.gnome.org/
  http://www.kde.org/

I think with windowmaker it means you can have active apps in the 'dock'
(wm's buttons/toolbar), whereby dropping an object (file, url, text, etc)
on the app will trigger an appropriate action.

Hi,

I'm using fvwm for several years now and this problem seems to persist:

from time to time, fvwm refuses to move windows by draging the titlebar,
or resize them from the corners. I'm not able to reproduce the bug, (not
even sure if it's fvwm's fault) but it's there from 1.x versions. Now I'm
using fvwm2-2.2 and the problem is still here.

The only solution is to shotdown X and restart it. Restarting the window
manager, or switching to another WM does not solve the problem.

I heve seen this on many computer types, with many different linux
distributions, discussed the problem with the local gurus, and now I'm
asking the question on the fvwm list...

First I though it's a problem with the X server, but I have friends who
are using different window managers and they don't have this problem.

can anyone tell me what's wrong?

best regards,
alex.

If you have the problem with other window managers then it is probably
not a bug with fvwm.

Just as a quick guess: do you ever press the NumLock or CapsLock key?

Cheers,
Tim.

Sorry for the silly quesion :). I didn't knew that NumLock is a modifier
like Control and Alt... Thanx for the answer.

I have disabled my num-lock, caps-lock and scroll-lock keys completely
and have never missed them (a much more elegant way than ripping them
off the keyboard as I have seen several times :) ). You will find a
detailed description of what to do in the FAQ file that comes with fvwm
(docs directory).

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Yep... and FVWM's equivalent to the dock is FvwmButtons, thus my comment
above :)

IOW, I can't think of anything the _core_ FVWM app would do with D&D,
but I can think of things that some of the _modules_ could do,
certainly.

I think it would be _'WAY_ cool if FvwmButtons supported D&D... I'd have
to look more closely at the protocol, though, to see how the FvwmButtons
configuration language would need to be extended to support it; I guess
you'd want to define new kinds of actions for the different types of
things that could be dropped on a button.

I modified a 2.2 version of FvwmWharf to accept drops via XDND, v3.   I also
wrote a simple
file-menu selection program so that one could select a file and drag it onto
Wharf which would
launch the application with the file.  However the menuing system is fairly
primitive, and should be rewritten with Mr. Vogt's new "dynamic" menus.
I'll muck around with the new version of
Fvwm this weekend and see if I can get it to work, and post it early next
week.  (I guess I
also have to check version 4 of XDND).

I replace FvwmPager in the standard configuration of Debian Linux

*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "FvwmPager")

by xload and added it

*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) xload)
 
Though there appear something like xload no information is displayed.

Is it possible to incorporate an xload into the buttons list (like fvwm95)?

Thanks.

	This probably is not the best spot for this question, but I'm
desperate.  I'm looking for a low resource hog browser that comes w/
RedHat 6.  Along with an e-mail program as well.  Netscrap is too damn
slow on a 486 66DX w/ 16 megs of ram..  Any suggestions???  Thanks in
advance.

Hi,

I haven't given up, and I'd like to thank all of you for your suggestions
and comments.  I have recompiled version 2.2.2 of fvwm and have chose to
build in rplay version 3.2.0b6.  I am using the following command, as per
the man pages

*FvwmEventCmd builtin-rplay

only this time it is not FvwmEvent which core dumps, but FvwmTaskBar.  The
output of running gdb over the core follows.

I'm planning on trying to decipher the code this weekend, but I thought I
might ask if anyone out there who probably knows a lot more about this
software than I do would like to help me out?  


The second option I tried was to use another sound player than the
builtin-rplay.  Segments of the fvwm2rc follow

*FvwmEventCmd myplay
*FvwmEventDelay 5
*FvwmEvent startup              matra.wav
*FvwmEvent shutdown             Shutdown.wav

...

AddToFunc "myplay" "I" Exec exec /usr/bin/play /usr/share/sound/$0

AddToFunc "SetupFunction"
+ "I" Exec xpmroot /home/tom/AnotherLevel/XPMs/moorish2.xpm 
#+ "I" Exec xsetroot -solid BG_COLOR
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent 

and 

/usr/bin/play /usr/share/sound/matra.wav 

does play when executed from a shell.

So, again I've run gdb over the core

(gdb) 


This time however I've looked at the file FvwmEvent.c and can only find
one instance of strcasecmp and that is

#ifdef HAVE_RPLAY
    /*
     * Builtin rplay support is enabled when FvwmAudioPlayCmd ==
builtin-rplay.
     */
    if (strcasecmp(cmd_line, "builtin-rplay") == 0)
	if ((rplay_fd = rplay_open(host)) < 0)
	{
	    rplay_perror("rplay_open");
	    exit(1);
	}
#endif

So what gives???

Thanks Much in advance,

Tom

The following line has been sufficient to put an active xload window in
my FvwmButtons console in fvwm2.0.46 and prior.

	*FvwmButtons (2x1) load NULL               Swallow "xload" \
		Exec nice -16 xload -nolabel -bg grey60 -update 5 \
		-geometry -1500-1500


It does not work in fvwm2.2, giving the following error messages:

	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "Exec"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "nice"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-16"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "xload"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-nolabel"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-bg"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "grey60"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-update"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "5"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-geometry"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option "-1500-1500"
	FwvmButton: Illegal Swallow option ""
	Missing Swallow argument

I have read the documentation through and through, searched the
archives,
and tried every combination of the above command I can find or think of.

Any suggests on how to get it to swallow a working xload window into the 
FvwmButton console?

Thanks in advance,

John

I'm running version 2.2.2.  I have an FvwmButtons panel with
one column and 8 rows/buttons down the left-hand edge of my
screen.  All works nicely but for the sizing of the buttons.
By default all the buttons are the same size, and I'd like to
make some of them taller.  I find that if I put a "Padding" or
"Size" directive into the parenthesized section for one
button, e.g.

 *FvwmButtons(Title "Editors", Icon Clipboard.xpm, \
   Padding 2 10, Action "Popup" Editors-Popup)

it ends up making _all_ the buttons bigger.  Is this a bug or
am I missing something?  Thanks in advance.  I'd appreciate
email since I'm not actually subscribed.

Well hardly been the expert in FvwmButtons setup I'd place "'s around Exec
to the end of the line, that always seems to work for me.
Other then that I can't see what is wrong.

Hi All,

I almost managed to get FvwmEvent to play sounds using rplay.  I noticed
the error was directly associated with the line 

#0  __strcasecmp (s1=0x0, s2=0x8050ae0 "focus_change_window")

so I stripped down the number of FvwmEvent lines to just a few which looks
like this

*FvwmEventCmd builtin-rplay
*FvwmEventRplayHost d185fcdc5.rochester.rr.com
*FvwmEventRplayVolume 127
*FvwmEventDelay 5
*FvwmEvent startup              matra.wav
*FvwmEvent shutdown             Shutdown.wav
*FvwmEvent iconify              shotgun.wav
*FvwmEvent deiconify            Wooeep.wav
*FvwmEvent new_page             Troll_Grumble.wav
*FvwmEvent new_desk             card_shuffle.wav

Picking just a few that I can test.  Now I do not get a core dump, but
still get no sound.  Executing "tail -f ~/.FVWM2-errors" I get the
following output on a RedHat 5.2 system.

[tom@d185fcdc5 tom]$ tail -f .FVWM2-errors

The errors are occuring when I iconify windows and what-not.  I tried to
specify my hostname as the host to play to, to no avail.  Does anyone out
there have experience with rplay and how I might get around this error?

Thanks,

Tom

Ps. Yes I know I have some hot-keys re-used, I just haven't had a chance
yet to learn how to correct this problem. :-)

Padding is done *inside* the buttons. If you want the buttons
to have different sizes, you must use several slots for the
bigger buttons. E.g.:

  *FvwmButtons(1x2, Title "Editors", Icon Clipboard.xpm, \
   Action "Popup" Editors-Popup)

Makes the button twice a tall as the other buttons. You need
one additional row for the button.

Bye

Hi all,

I finally narrowed down the problem which is causing FvwmEvent and
FvwmTaskBar to core dump.  RedHat 5.2 has defined in the file
fvwm2rc.modules.m4 a list of events under which audio should be played
which are NOT correct.  The two I found which are present are 

*FvwmAudio focus_change_window 
*FvwmAudio toggle_paging

These are not listed for example in the FvwmEvent man page.  Instead,

*FvwmEvent focus_change

is listed in the FvwmEvent man page.  I don't know if something changed
with the core dist of fvwm or whether this problem was always present.
Essentially as I see it, the problem with version 2.2 (I assume from
Jacques' email that it is not present in version 2.3) has to do with how
it should handle the situation when it receives an in-appropriate
definition.  You might try this for yourself, to see if I'm right. :-)
Just change from 

*FvwmEvent focus_change boing.au

to 

*FvwmEvent focus_change_window boing.au

and you should find on restarting fvwm that you get a core dump.  I hope
this serves as a usefull note to other RedHat users.

Cheers,
Tom

Ps. Thanks to all for their help!

Along this same line, is it possible to make a swallowed app in
FvwmButtons take up 1.5 button columns and 2 button rows in a 3 
column button bar? Like this:

I would like to swallow a some apps that don't scale well to the typical
64x64 icon/button dimensions. 
 
Thanks,

It may seem rather kludge looking but this is how I would do it.
*FvwmButtonsRows 7
*FvwmColumns 6
*FvwmButtons(3x3 Swallow etc.)
*FvwmButtons(3x3 Swallow etc.)
*FvwmButtons(2x2 etc.) repeat x5

Is it possible to use a window's CLIENT_MACHINE for Style attributes.
I often have shells opened up on several different hosts, all with their
DISPLAY set to my local machine.  It would be great to be able to use
the StartsOn[Desk|Page] property to constrain the windows from those
hosts to certain desktops.  This is especially true when I am running
the same app on the different hosts and thus the windows all have the
same NAME, CLASS and RESOURCE strings.

Thanks,

This kind of enhancemant has considered in the past. I don't remember
what came of the conversation last time.

In the meantime, I take it that the window title get set by the app
you run, e.g. VIM sets the xterm title to "VIM -- /path/to/file". This
is what you mean? Why not just open these xterms with the -t flag as
in

xterm -lservis -title foohost -e [rlogin/ssh] foohost

and style match the arbitrary string you set? This is what I do from
home using the following bits from my .fvwm2rc:

+ "Shell&7%mini.xterm.xpm%" \
  Exec exec xterm -fn \
  '-b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-17-*-100-100-*' \
  -title Shell7 -geometry 80x40 \
  -e ssh -l mikehan shell7.ba

Style "Shell7" UseStyle Netscape, Icon penguin.xpm, StartsOnPage 0 1 1

The Style line matches the title when the window got mapped. What
happens after that, FVWM could care less (unless you do a recapture).

Unfortunately it is not that simple.  I run other apps like MATLAB,
ANSYS, etc that have lots of windows(transients) popping up & down all
the time and I can not set their titles individually for each machine. 
The only difference between them is CLIENT_MACHINE resource.

As I was think about this, I thought about something that could come in
handy when defining Style attributes.  It would great if the Style
attributes could be defined individually or globally for each of the
windows NAME, CLASS, RESOURCE and MACHINE strings.  What I mean is that
say I want all windows with a windowname of 'transient' to have NoTitle
but those same windows from CLIENT_MACHINE='remote' to StartIconic.
Under the current implementation I don't think this is possible(Correct
me if I am wrong).  So perhaps the windowname could be either a single
quoted string for the global case or sets of quoted strings(no spaces
between), one for the windowname and one for the string to match
against. An example:

# no second quote immediately after the windowname means global
Style "transient"  NoTitle
# a second quoted pair immediately after the windowname means apply 
# only to the window with client string matching "remote" 
Style "transient""client""remote"  StartIconic
# If there are an even pair then the first of the pair is the string and
# second is the windowname to match.
Style "client""remote" StartOnDesk 2

This enhancement, if added, would be backwards compatible since a lack
of a additional quoted strings would mean apply to all windows matching
the windowname as is the case now.

Just a thought, send to /dev/null if you want,

I suppose this can be done with a 6 column wide button bar. The buttons of
first row are 3 columns wide any, and the buttons of the other rows 2 columns
wide. But I have not checked if this really works!  Try it yourself.

AFAIK, this would break the parser. I would prefer a syntax something like

Style "ICON=xclock" StartIconic
Style "TITLE=Netscape:*" StartsOnDesk 26
Style "MACHINE=nsahost" Decor ThoughtPolice

This is similar to what is done by FvwmIconMan, and would resolve a lot of
the ambiguity inherent in the current system. OTOH, given the kind of
complex logic some people seem to want, it might be better to have a
facility to set styles from a module, then you could have a module
programmable to do things like

if (ICON=xclock && MACHINE=sping) Decor AtlanticTime, NoHandles

But perhaps that would be pushing it.

This was designed to death a while back.  fvwm2  uses '[]' notation in
other contexts.  This is probably in the todo list.  From memory, this
seemed to be best:

Style [ ICON xterm, TITLE hosta ] NoHandles

I like this better, much cleaner and intuitive.  I was just putting my
initial thoughts out.  I was pointed to the discussion in the archive
of Dec.'98 and found that it was also in the enhancments list. 

I wish I knew enough C to make a contribution....someday.

Cheers all!

I have found that I cannot start fvwm if my noclobber variable is set. It
appears that fvwm95 cannot clobber (overwrite) a file /tmp/fvwmrcaxxxxx
that it creates and therefore cannot start. This file is created after
fvwm is executed, because deleting any fvwmrc files in /tmp before execing
fvwm does not solve the problem. 

The error message appears in .FVWM2-errors and it's something like

sh: FVWM cannot clobber file /tmp/fvwmrcaxxxxxx

Question is, how do I have noclobber on and bypass this problem?

Hi, All. 

I've been using fvwm2.2 for about a month now. Very nice. (Currently
running 2.2.2 on sun-solaris, w/o c++ modules.) I have one problem I just
don't understand, though. 

In my .fvwm2rc, I have

Style "*" ClickToFocus

and

Key F9		A	M	Next [ CurrentScreen CurrentDesk ] Focus
Key F10		A	M	Prev [ CurrentScreen CurrentDesk ] Focus

So that I can use the keyboard to switch the window focus around the
screen. The problem is that every now and then it just stops working
right! Some windows at random become "unaccessable" -- I can't move the
focus to them with the keyboard, only by moving the mouse onto them and
clicking.

Once I've clicked on the unaccessable window, usually the other
group becomes unaccessable. It is like there's some barrier in the
window list preventing the Next & Prev commands from getting the whole
way through. 

(Another detail: I give some of my sticky windows, like xbiff, the
attributes WindowListSkip and CirculateSkip, so that they never get focus
from my keyboard shortcuts. Sometimes it seems like this may be the source
of the problem, but I can't be sure.)

Any insights? 

Thanks,
			--- Marc.

This does not work either. If a pager *does* appear that's because it
is started somewhere else in your config file.

This is just the label. ------------------------------|

The correct syntax of the Swallow commands is:

  Swallow(options) Label Command

I.e. in above line the command part is missing, i.e. nothing is executed.
If you would start xload manually it would be swallowed into the button bar.

I believe what you see is simply an empty button that looks pressed in.
The correct line is:

*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "xload" 'Exec xload')
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try replacing the function RemoveButton in ButtonArray.c (FvwmTaskBar)
with this version (I've checked in a bug fix for 2.3.4, but I think it
works with 2.2.2 too):

void RemoveButton(ButtonArray *array, int butnum)
{
  Button *temp, *temp2;

  if (butnum == 0) {
    temp2 = array->head;
  } else {
    temp = find_n(array, butnum-1);
    if (temp == NULL) return;
    temp2 = temp->next;
  }
  if (temp2 == NULL) return;
  temp->next = temp2->next;

  if (array->tail == temp2) array->tail = temp;

  ButtonDelete(temp2);
  array->count--;
  if (temp != array->head)
    temp = temp->next;
  for (; temp!=NULL; temp=temp->next)

}

The reason is that when the last button in the internal list was deleted,
the code tried to access 'temp2->next' although temp2 might be NULL. I didn't
check that fix myself, so it would be nice if you could verify it.

I get this exact problem when I have deleted or iconified a particular 
sticky window and my cursor is no longer over another window on the 
screen. Interestingly, I also lose all key mappings at that point until I 
manually point the mouse at a window.  This sounds related to the problem 
you are having.

I tried to solve this by defining functions to specify what to do after 
iconifying a window or deleting a window.  My goal was to pick the next 
reasonable window on the current screen.  However, I never got 
satisfactory results, and the partial results I got were noticably slow.  
For now, I live with the fact that I occasionally need to reestablish 
focus using the mouse.

This does not work either. If a pager *does* appear that's because it
is started somewhere else in your config file.

This is just the label. ------------------------------|

The correct syntax of the Swallow commands is:

  Swallow(options) Label Command

I.e. in above line the command part is missing, i.e. nothing is executed.
If you would start xload manually it would be swallowed into the button bar.

I believe what you see is simply an empty button that looks pressed in.
The correct line is:

*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "xload" 'Exec xload')
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try replacing the function RemoveButton in ButtonArray.c (FvwmTaskBar)
with this version (I've checked in a bug fix for 2.3.4, but I think it
works with 2.2.2 too):

void RemoveButton(ButtonArray *array, int butnum)
{
  Button *temp, *temp2;

  if (butnum == 0) {
    temp2 = array->head;
  } else {
    temp = find_n(array, butnum-1);
    if (temp == NULL) return;
    temp2 = temp->next;
  }
  if (temp2 == NULL) return;
  temp->next = temp2->next;

  if (array->tail == temp2) array->tail = temp;

  ButtonDelete(temp2);
  array->count--;
  if (temp != array->head)
    temp = temp->next;
  for (; temp!=NULL; temp=temp->next)
    temp->needsupdate = 1;

  ArrangeButtonArray(array);
}

The reason is that when the last button in the internal list was deleted,
the code tried to access 'temp2->next' although temp2 might be NULL. I didn't
check that fix myself, so it would be nice if you could verify it.

Padding is done *inside* the buttons. If you want the buttons
to have different sizes, you must use several slots for the
bigger buttons. E.g.:

  *FvwmButtons(1x2, Title "Editors", Icon Clipboard.xpm, \
   Action "Popup" Editors-Popup)

Makes the button twice a tall as the other buttons. You need
one additional row for the button.

Dominik,

I have managed to keep FvwmEvent and FvwmTaskBar from core dumping by
"removing" the incorrect events, such as focus_change_window, defined in
the default "AnotherLevel" m4 files included in the RedHat 5.2 dist.  and
as Jacques has reported the soounds are played correctly; i.e. no garbage
in, no garbage out.  Nevertheless, I changed the RemoveButton function to
the one you sent me below, recompiled FvwmTaskBar, and installed it in the
appropriate directory.  The result was however less than favorable.  As
soon as my mouse touched the TaskBar, it was removed from the desktop, and
the sound played was that of killing or closing a window.  Does this
behavior make sense to you?  By the way, I'm using focus-follows-mouse.
I'm sorry I can't help more, but I do not as yet understand the code all
that well.  Suggestions?

Note that this is the wrong place to ask questions about fvwm95. It's
a spin off of fvwm2 and is not maintained on this list. I don't think
fvwm95 is actively maintained at all.

Try to explicitly remove the old file. If you start fvwm95 from
.xinitrc you could try to insert this line before the line that
starts the WM:

  rm /tmp/fvwmrca*

Of course you should only delete your own files :)

I can only guess the patch doesn't work with the taskbar from 2.2. BTW,
can you send me what you've done in FvwmEvent again (i.e. which events did you
remove)? Due to a configuration problem in my mail system I lost 50 mails
or so.

I assume from the choice of fvwm95 that this is a RedHat system.  If so
and you start up your session through xdm, the graphical login interface,
then when logging in xdm looks for either a file .xsession or .Xclients in
your home directory.  See the script /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession .  If neither
is found it executes the script /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients .  In this script
there are already a number of file removes executed to clean up.  It seems
to me that if you copy this script into your home directory and rename it
to either .xsession or .Xclients then you can add the delete suggested by
Dominik there and be sure that nothing else will change with your login
session.

Hi, All.

Quick question: Is there any way to tie an action to clicking on a
swallowed app in FvwmButtons? I tried tying an action to a swallowed
xload, but clicking on it seems to do nothing. I guess what is happening
is that the click is getting passed on to the running app & not the button
bar itself. Is there any way to get around this? 

What I have currently in my rc file is this:

*FvwmButtons(Swallow "xload" 'Exec xload -nolabel &', \
             Action 'Exec xterm -e top &')


Thanks,

			--- Marc.

No. Older versions of the man page simply lie about it.

Exactly.

>Is there any way to get around this? 

Yes: write a patch :-) I tried to implement it, but I'm not good enough
a X programmer to get it working. I guess it would require to reparent
the swallowed applications in a window with the same size to do it, but
I don't dare to try.

on several machines, when the window is moved part-way outside the outside 
virtual window, Xsun seems to go into an endless loop of some sort. With the result
that the dual screen seem to freeze (until I kill Xsun, of course).

Any Ideas ?

All I managed to do is launch an application from an "xload button" by
selecting fwvm buttons and pressing the Enter key. I don't know it I'm
corect, but xload handles mouse click's itself while it does not handle
keypresses, so thay can be handled by fvwm.

Here is the code from my .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmButtons(3x2, Swallow XLoad 'Exec xload -bg \\\#667788 -nolabel &', \
	     Action "Exec xosview &")

Have fun,
alex.

Subject: FVWM: Problem with virtual window switching with mouse under 2.2.2
Date: Wed, 16 Jun 1999 16:25:54 CDT
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

  I've noticed a slight oddity with fvwm-2.2.2 under Tru64/Dec Unix/OSF1
when running on a 1280x1024 display; it works fine on 1024x768 displays
(which use the on-board video card as opposed to the machine with the
1280x1024 display which uses an add-on card from Digital).

  If I use the mouse to switch virtual windows by moving the mouse off
the right side of the screen and move the mouse too quickly, the pointer
goes off in to "null space" -- the virtual window does not switch.  If I
do the same behavior, moving the mouse very slowly, then it switches with
no problem.

  As far as panning up, down, and left, I can move the mouse as fast as I
want to and it switches every time, but the right side is picky.  I also
noticed that this same machine (with the 1280x1024 display) has two
displays, so I had to use fvwm2's '-s' option to prevent two instances of
fvwm from starting.

  My best guess is that the machine with the add-on video card (and the
1280x1024 display) is running a different X server than most of our other
Dec Unix running 1024x768.

I have enclosed the output from 'xdpyinfo -ext all' from the 1280x1024
screen in hopes it will be useful.  Any thoughts on how to fix this
problem would be most appreciated.

Thanks,
-Jason

I've been playing with VNC (http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/)
lately and ran into a context switching problem.

The basic problem is that fvwm captures key events that you would like
to pass to VNC and the fvwm running for the Xvnc server.  For example,
if you have:

Key F4          A       M       Destroy

and do an alt-F4 over the vnc window, you will destroy the vnc window.
Instead, I'd like to have the alt-F4 passed into the VNC window where
the fvwm running on the Xvnc server can be commanded to destroy a
window.

Does anyone have a good solution to this?

I'd like to not arrange to have different command sets for the
internal and external fvwms - it becomes too confusing.

I messed with the code of void HandleKeyPress() to make it pass
events to the vnc window directly like so:

  if (Tmp_win && Tmp_win->frame_width == 1284 ) 
     /*my quick little hack to test if the window is a vnc window*/;
  else 
    for (key = Scr.AllBindings; key != NULL; key = key->NextBinding)
      {
	if ((key->Button_Key == Event.xkey.keycode) &&
	    ((key->Modifier == (modifier&(~LockMask)))||
	     (key->Modifier == AnyModifier)) &&
	    (key->Context & Context)&&
	    (key->IsMouse == 0))
	  {
	    ExecuteFunction(key->Action,Tmp_win, &Event,Context,-1);
	    return;
	  }
    }
  
  /* if we get here, no function key was bound to the key.  Send it
   * to the client if it was in a window we know about.
   */

This doesn't quite work.  It appears to pass an 'Alt' fine but not an
'Alt+F4'.  I suspect I don't fully understand the fvwm event model.
Any ideas?

Well unfortunatelly a while back I tried a code fix to this as well and
had equally poor results, and I do have a pretty good understanding of
the event model.

What I did find works is if I hit Num Lock on, all my bindings seem to
get passed through to the vnc window, instead of the external fvwm.  I
never figured out why it worked, but then again I didn't want to start
messing with it and have it break.  So try num lock and let me know if
it works for you as well.

Cool.  Seems to work for me.  I bet what's happening is that
numlock-on/numlock-off counts as a 'hyper key' for X purposes.
Consequently, when the numlock is on, your normal control/meta/shift
combinations don't work because they also have the "numlock-on" bit
set.  Since the combination doesn't trigger an action, it's passed on
to the underlying window.  This all makes sense except it doesn't
account for why the internal fvwm ignores the numlock.  hmmm..

Anyway, thanks for the tip.

   Hi all,

	I just got fvwm2 running on my Sun/Solaris and CDE 1.2. However,
   I can't find a pixmaps directory. So, apparently, I can't use toys
   like xclock, xbiff, and who knows what else.

	Should this installation of Solaris have a pixmaps directory? (No,
   I don't control the source, else I would look!) I do have XPM 3.4k
   for Solaris installed, if it matters.

	Is there some way to simply get rid of dtlogin/CDE, and simply
   use a nice "startx" program? No, I really don't think CDE is a "good
   idea".

						Thanks,
							Bruce

That was exactlly by thought, I know Num Lock does count as a modifier
but I couldn't figure out why the internal was stripping it either.  My
only thought was that maybe VNC strips it off, as part of there Windoze
support.

Glad to here that it worked though.

You can do it either through the builtin icon box, which really just
provides predefined space on the desktop to put icons; there's no
graphical box with scroll bars, etc.; see the fvwm2 man page and look
for IconBox.

Or you can do it with the FvwmIconBox module, which gives a real,
graphical box for icons.  See the FvwmIconBox man page.

I've never seen any xpm files shipped with Solaris.
Solaris does ship with black and white bitmaps which fvwm2 will use.

Use this command to find them:

find /usr/openwin -name '*.xbm'

The fvwm2  package contains a load of  icons, there just not installed
(yet).  Most of  them  are in  the  "icons"  directory of  the  source
distribution.

Even better, you probably want to check out:

http://wm-icons.dhs.org/

Caution, second-hand information follows:

cd /etc/rc2.d
mkdir tmp
mv S99dtlogin tmp

Huh? The absense of a pixmaps shouldn't affect the applications you
mention.

I'm running Solaris 2.5 and can only find some bitmap directories:

  /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/bitmaps
  /usr/openwin/share/include/Xol/bitmaps
  /usr/dt/share/include/bitmaps

You should be OK just using the icons/ directory that came with fvwm.

On my machines I rename /etc/rc2.d/S99dtlogin to something
like _S99dtlogin (anything not starting with an 'S' or 'K').
This prevents dtlogin from starting at boot time.

You can base a startx program on /usr/openwin/bin/openwin (ugh),
or if you like I've got one I wrote which I could send you.

Use a command like this:

  Style * IconBox +580 +964 +1279 +1023
                  ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^
                   x1   y1   x2    y2

Where (x1 y1) is the top left corner of the box and (x2 y2) is the
lower right corner.

Please have a look at the FAQ to find out about the RedHat fvwm setup.
The command you want to remove is called FvwmPager. Simply remove the
line once you have found the responsible config file.

Fellow Virtual Window Manager users,

I recently switched from 2.0.43 to 2.2.2
Now when I use my bindings for switching focus bewteen windows, there is a full second pause between the raise and the focus change for a window.

This is extremely annoying, does anyone have any ideas for me to check?

AddToFunc Circ

This is because you would be better off using

AddToFunc Circ "I" Focus
+ "I" Raise

or if you are fussy about style (like I am)

AddToFunc \
  "I" Focus
+ "I" Raise

Either of these should fix your problem.

Do you mean you flip pages and the pointer lands on the root window?
With SloppyFocus the window that had the focus will keep the focus and
with MouseFocus no window will get the focus. That's exactly the way it
is supposed to work. I'm not sure if I understood you correctly.

Wrong directory -- if you install the CDE desktop stuff, Sun ships tons of
xpm files in /usr/dt/appconfig/icons/C -- all those *.pm files are xpm files
for all the cde stuff.

Bad idea.  Instead (as root) run:

	/usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -d

which will disable the CDE desktop auto-start, and then TO KILL YOUR CURRENT
CDE LOGIN SESSION ALTOGETHER, run

	/usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -kill

Of course, you might be better off adding fvwm2 to your list of available
desktop managers so that if you needed to run CDE for something (???), you
still could... but to each his own...

Hope this helps,

About a month ago I sent a question to this list relating to a color
map problem that I was having.  I haven't gotten a reply of any sort
so I'm going to try again (I'm subscribed to the list this time so
there's no need to keep me in the cc: list, or any such garbage).

Basically, fvwm2 starts with some colors in the color map inverted.
That is, black and white, red and cyan, and blue and yellow1, and
others, are inverted.

Starting netscape -install and moving the cursor inside the netscape
window seems to fix the problems.

fvwm v1.24 and twm both are color map problem free.

The problem seems somehow related to X resources.  With an empty
.Xresources file, the color map (at least, according to xcolors)
appears to be fine.  Different nonempty .Xresources file produce
different inversions, however.

The particular machine I'm having problems with is a Sun Ultra 5
running Solaris 2.6.  The frame buffer is a mach64 derivative.  The
following is the contents of my .xserverrc:

DISPLAY=:0 mkcookie
X -auth $HOME/.Xauthority -dev /dev/fb0 dpix 72 dpiy 75 defclass TrueColor

I've built 2.2.2 on another solaris 2.6 machine, an ultra 1 with a
creator graphics card, and it works fine (that is, no color map
problems).

I'd file a bug report, but I don't know if this is a bona fide bug, or
if I'm just doing something dumb.  Your help is much appreciated.

First, thanks to all at fvwm for a great WM. 

I've used 1.2X for several years with pleasure.  Recently I
installed 2.2.2, and I like many of the new features.  One
little problem I've run into.  I'm using FvwmBacker for a
little visual variety, putting a background xpm onto one of my
desks (the rest have solid color backgrounds).  And into the
bargain I've compiled rxvt for "transparency" to let the pixmap
shine through.  So I have an rxvt window sitting on the xpm'd
desk, and other stuff going on elsewhere.  Now when I shift to
the xpm'd desk the xpm turns on OK, but the rxvt background
remains with the solid color of the desktop I just left.  I
suppose this is because of the slight delay in the xpm
appearing: the rxvt background has already been set.  

I can get the rxvt bg to show the pixmap by doing a manual
"Refresh", or a "clear", but obviously it would be nicer to have
it happen automatically.  So I'm wondering what I could put into
the "*FvwmBackerDesk N" command to make this happen.  (I've
tried appending "Refresh" after "xpmroot" but that doesn't work,
I suppose because fvwm doesn't wait for the xpmroot to finish
before doing the refresh.)

Thanks in advance.

Note that this is a problem of rxvt, not fvwm. You could use
FvwmCommand. Assuming you put this stuff in your InitFunc:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + Module FvwmCommandS
  + Exec "xpmroot <your image> ; FvwmCommand Refresh"

This ensures you get the refres after xpmroot has run.

I probably didn't explain myself well enough, but I don't think
that adding to InitFunction will do what I want.  I have a solid
background on desk 1, an xpm background and a "transparent" rxvt
on desk 3.  Fvwm has been running for some time.  I use Fvwm
Pager to move from desk 3 to desk 1: all OK.  I use the pager
again to move from desk 1 to desk 3: the background fills in
fine (after a slight delay), but the rxvt (which was drawn with
no appreciable delay) retains the background of desk 1.  What I
wish to do is insert a "wait" (for the xpmroot) before a
"Refresh" of desk 3, so the rxvt will have the right background.

Dominik,

That's great news!  Can you tell me the details of the fix for version
2.2.2 and later?  I tried one suggestion you'd made before to no avail.
I'd like to incorporate the inprovements to make the code more robust.

Thanks,

Tom

There were two events missing at the end of the list (before the builtin
events). These events are defined in fvwm/mnodule.h (at least in 2.2).
When you make a typo, FvwmEvent searches past the end of the list since
the lenght of the list is defined in module.h. Just add entries for the
missing two events.

Uh, did the pointer perhaps move to the second display? I don't know
exactly what you have to do to get a multi headed setup, but this
sounds awfully like it. When you move over the right border on such
a setup you cursor will warp to the other display. That's an issue of
the X server(s).

Uh, you made it clear enough, I'm just tired. Try using FvwmEvent.

Dominik,

I hate to be a pest, but I assume you mean the "defines" which begin with
#define M_NEW_PAGE           (1)
#define M_NEW_DESK           (1<<1)
#define M_ADD_WINDOW         (1<<2)
...

I'm not sure what the missing events are however... Two which I do not see
are startup and shutdown, but these do not cause a core dump for me,
even though they also do nothing, so I suspect I'm missing something.
Moreover, if I find them, what do I define them as?  If it is too much
trouble to extract that section out of your header file can you point me
to a version of Fvwm which has the problem in module.h corrected.

Thanks Much,
Tom

Your're not a pest, it's my fault. I could easily provide more complete
information if I had the time.

The missing parts are:

  #define M_LOCKONSEND         (1<<26)
  #define M_SENDCONFIG         (1<<27)

The problem was that a loop scanned the list of events until up to
MAX_MESSAGES didn't match, but MAX_MESSAGES is defined like this:

  #define MAX_MESSAGES         28

I.e. although the list had only 26 entries it tried to acces 28.
You need to add these two right after the "dewindowshade" line:

  "lockonsend",
  "sendconfig",

The last three events seem to be internal events of FvwmEvent.

Uh, the flaw is in FvwmEvent.c, not in module.h.

Then do 
 AddToFunc InitFunction

*FvwmBackerDesk 3 Exec "xpmroot <your image> ; FvwmCommand Refresh"

FVWM Experts,

Does anyone know the answer to this question?
Why does an empty line on the AddToFunc line cause a large delay?
If I had a preprocessor creating these files, and selecting from a 
predefined set of commands to put in the function, I find it simpler,
and IMHO elegant to define the function that will be modified without 
tacking the definition onto the same line.

For menus at least a title definition makes sense on the first line.

This is an artifact from the original "intention" of functions, which
was to provide a set of functions that could be performed when a
titlebar button is pressed.

What happens if there isn't an "immediate" "I" after the AddToFunc Circ
is that fvwm2 pauses for a certain amount of time in order to detect if
a "double click" happened.  Now, since functions are no longer only
spawned by title bar buttons, this pause isn't needed.  I think the
weird syntax was to tell fvwm2 NOT to ever delay for a double click.

Mark, 

  Do you mean to say that this delay was not present in 2.0.x? I thought I had
  to deal with that ever since the 2.0.x. Anyway, I tried to look through the
  source, but it seems to me the code covers the case where there is nothing on
  the AddToFunc line, and is not doing any excessive searching. So, in the end,
  I came out no wiser than before.

  As a workaround, can't you tell your preprocessor to put a '\' at the end of
  the AddToFunc line, and remove the + from the next.

  This should probably be considered a bug.

Well, Dominik is one of the most expert FVWM Experts there is :).  I
think perhaps his question is better phrased as, why do you think this
will make a difference?

FWIW, I do this kind of thing all the time and I don't notice any extra
delays.  I'm not using 2.2.2, though.

I do seem to recall that early on in the 2.3.x phase, before even 2.3.1
was cut I think, there was a change that caused this to happen... but
it's been fixed for ages and was never in any released versions that I
know of.

Is this really true?  I can hardly believe it.  I can see
differentiating between, say:

  AddToFunc Circ
  + "I" something

vs.

  AddToFunc Circ
  + "C" something

where the clicktime is needed if you want to know if you had a
double-click or not (although maybe you really only need to wait if both
a "C" _and_ a "D" are given?)... but differentiating between:

  AddToFunc Circ [...anything...]

vs.

  AddToFunc Circ
  + [...anything...]

_has_ to be a bug... doesn't it?  Isn't this just merely a parsing
issue, and the difference is completely resolved during the fvwm2rc file
parsing at startup?

Okay, now this has aroused my interest. I remember vaguely that there
was such a problem. I can see it with 2.2.0, but with 2.3.4 it's gone
which is no wonder as both, the function execution code and the function
parsing code has undergone extensive rewrites. I guess it won't be
fixed in the 2.2.x series.

Hi, I dont know if it will suit your needs but I suggest that you use
Esetroot for setting your backgrounds if you are are using
transparency_. It seems to work pretty goed for rxvt. dont know where to
get it but I think It might be part of the Eterm dist.

Hi there,

We haven't spoken in some time, but I wanted you to know 
about an opportunity that might perhaps make sense to you, 
or maybe even someone in your sphere of influence.

A very major financial institution is looking for the best 
of the best to join their Unix Server Admin staff.

Check this out;  375 servers and looking to grow.  If you 
are currently a heavy UNIX person (or know one) who has:

* 5+ years of experience

* One or more of the following:  DEC, HP, AIX, SUN

* Prefers Business Casual dress, Great Benefits

* Would consider a full relocation package to a very sunny 
state not too far from sandy beaches on a major ocean

Get back to me (email) to discuss the details of this 
project, and let me know what your career direction is.

(we are looking for 12 people, and the $$money is top 
shelf)

Ping me back and please include an up-to-date resume file 
(MSWord). If this opportunity isn't exactly on the mark 
for you, include in your note a description of your 
current career objectives, availability and an update of 
your salary requirements...

Talk to you soon,

Bill Thomas
CSAM
bthomas@profcareer.com


Not Interested?  Forward this to a friend or colleague.  
Perhaps they'll do the same for you someday...

PS: These positions are in the US, and unfortunately we 
are not able to sponsor those not authorized to work in 
the United States

This looks very promising.  But when I try to start FvwmCommandS
(at Init or from a menu) I'm getting "FvwmCommandS: dead pipe"
right away.  Any ideas what might be wrong here?  Thanks.

Thanks, I just tried that.  Esetroot works OK, but does not
solve the particular timing problem I'm having with xpmroot.

If you are running on a linux kernel this is a know bug, and fixed in the beta series. 
if you edit modules/FvwmCommand/FvwmCommandS.c replace
  SendText(Fd,"",0); /* tell fvwm that we are here */
with
  SendText(Fd," ",0); /* tell fvwm that we are here */

The problem is that linux pipes die on zero length packets.

Thanks!  Now it works perfectly, the rxvt picks up the right

First of all thank you for your help!
Second of all I am sorry for the very long message, but I really don't
know what I need to send you. I am trying to install it on an SGI O2
Irix 6.5.

I downloaded Version 2.2.2 and I was running into the same problem Paul
Hurley had. I was doing as Paul Smith was replying to him (found on the
mailing list) ->

...

We'll just have do it ourselves.  Go to about line 1360 in your
configure script, and change the if-statement from this:

  ac_cv_prog_cc_works=yes
  # If we can't run a trivial program, we are probably using a cross
compiler.
> if (./conftest; exit) 2>/dev/null; then
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=no
  else
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=yes
  fi

To this:

  ac_cv_prog_cc_works=yes
  # If we can't run a trivial program, we are probably using a cross
compiler.
> if (./conftest; exit); then
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=no
  else
    ac_cv_prog_cc_cross=yes
  fi

...


Here is now my output, plus the attached config.log ->

In general, try to cut out the stuff that doesn't seem directly related

This is all we really need.

Ok, so it looks like the runtime linker can't find or load the libstdc++
shared library ("Cannot successfully map soname ...")

Before anything else, remember to always remove the config.cache file
before re-running configure.  Just safer that way.

First, do you have libstdc++ installed?  Where is it?

Second, is it any of the places mentioned in that path above?

Third, what is your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set to, if
anything (echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)?  What about LD_RUN_PATH (I don't know
if Irix uses this).

The problem appears to be that while the shared library can be found at
linktime, it can't be found at runtime.  I don't know anything about
Irix, but on Solaris, for example, you have to add -R<lib> in order to
get the runtime linker to find shared libs; the -L option is only used
at initial link time.

You could also (on many systems) modify the standard places the runtime
linker looks for shared libs; see the ldconfig man page (you can't do
this on Solaris, though).

You could also try using the --without-cxx option to configure, which
should disable this check for C++ altogether (one of the modules won't
compile; I forget which one).

I figured out the cause of my color map problems.  The color map
starts out fine, but when there is console output to the frame buffer
while fvwm is running, it gets all screwed up.  So, starting xconsole
before fvwm fixed this problem, and I feel like a moron.  Oddly
enough, however, I was not experiencing this problem with twm...

OBTW, am I talking at a wall here?  Why haven't I gotten a response of
any kind, even a "fsck off" or somesuch?

That _is_ really weird.

I typically start X with stdout and stderr redirected to a file, so that
I never get anything printed directly to the screen.  Something like:

  $ startx >& ~/.Xerrorlog

or somesuch

Probably no one had any idea what to tell you, and everyone was waiting
for someone else to say something :).

Sorry if you are angry now. I think simply nobody had an idea what
could have caused this. Normally I'd have mailed back some question, but
I felt totally incompetent here. I really would have replied to this mail
some time, but at the moment my mailbox has 285 mails I have still to work
on (counting fvwm mails only). Please accept our apologies.

Bye

Same here.  There's lots of people on this mailing list that want
to help.  You just had a problem no one would hazard a guess on.

Any one else that feels they are being ignored, try again with more
information.

And they all rolled over and said (along with me, off-list), "Sorry".  
But really, this would have left me off in the ozone.  This seems like a
Really Good Candidate for a Hall of Fame "Nasty Problem" list.  As it is
probably very memory allocation specific, using different wm's with all
else the same could cause very different behavior.  Is there a list of
really obscure "I saw this once" issues assembled for problem debuggers to
go through?  The corrective action Gary took was not intuitively obvious,
but was so easy to try that it would be worth a place on such a list.  At
the very least, it appears so if one has the same platform.

Now I'll go back into lurk mode until I see something I know about.  And
thanks for all of you who read and make suggestions.  You're a great
crowd.  (That's the nearest approach I can make to an fvwm-related topic.)

I can think of 2 lists:

1.  Our collective memories
2.  The mail archives

I don't think a list would have helped.  I don't think the problem was
ever reported before.  Even if we had known about the missing XConsole
process, I've  seen raw output on  the X display lots  of times.  I've
never seen it cause color map problems.

I just wrote a binary to my Ultra 5's X display.  It makes a mess that
could be interpreted as the colormap being messed up, but the colormap
is fine.

If the   problem  turns out to  occur  with  more  frequency, it would
qualify for another list, the FAQ.

Hello.  I just recently started using FVWM 2.2.2, and I have been trying
(unsuccessfully) to find the answers to several questions related to
icons.

First, is there a way to make the icon title come to the front of the
surrounding area when the mouse passes over it?  At present, when I pass
the mouse over an icon, the icon title will expand to give me the full
title, but sometimes will expand behind other icons instead of in front
of other icons where I can read it.  How can I make it always come to
the front without using the Autoraise module.

Also, is there a way to make all the icons the same size so that they
have a uniform look?  Is there an option I can specify?

Last, every once in a while, an icon will place itself behind another
icon, instead of in an open spot.  I haven't been able to reproduce this
reliably.  Its not a problem, though, since I have the WindowList bound
to a mouse button, but I just thought you might like to know.

Thank you in advance,
Patrick

I wanted the same uniform look so I've specified Icons for programs which
would normally provide their own as well as a default:


Style "NCDterm"     Icon Terminal.xpm, Sticky
Style "NCDconsole"  Icon Terminal.xpm, Sticky
Style "xlsbatch"    Icon Database.xpm, Sticky
Style "Crisp"       Icon TextEditor.xpm
Style "Netscape*"   Icon Multiview.xpm
Style "pine"        Icon Mail.xpm, Sticky
Style "*"           Icon Shell2.xpm, Color lightgrey/dimgrey


My specified icons were choosen in such that they are the same size.

This feature is not in 2.2.2 but in the current alpha releases (2.3.4 is
the latest). If you need it urgently you can fetch fvwm-2.3.4 from our
web site, but be warned that 2.3.4 is not considered stable. It has
several open problems that may bother you, foremost some debugging
output on the console. We are planning to get out the next stable release
(fvwm-2.4) within two months. So if you can wait a little longer...

Can you find a fairly reliable way to reproduce this?

Manually move an icon.  Fvwm2 stops avoiding it.

I believe this is on purpose, but the motivation for the "feature"
isn't clear to me.

Uh, really?  Experimenting with this I see that new icons *do* avoid
the moved one, but the move icon itself will happily overlap any other
in its designated place.

Dan, you know your way around with icon boxes. The passage responsible
for this bug is (icons.c, AutoPlaceIcon, line 489 ff.):

  if(IS_ICON_MOVED(t))
    {
      ... use old location
    }
  else if (t->wmhints && t->wmhints->flags & IconPositionHint)
    {
      ... unrelated code
    }
  /* dje 10/12/97:
     Look thru chain of icon boxes assigned to window.
     Add logic for grids and fill direction.
  */
  else {
      ... handle icon boxes
    }

When the icon has been moved the code avoiding other icons is
never activated (the passage handling icon boxes). Is it
difficult to feed the icon box code with the current position
of the icon as default and just make the icon avoid others
without warping into the icon box?

The general structure should be like this:

  if (t->wmhints && t->wmhints->flags & IconPositionHint)
  {
    if (!IS_ICON_MOVED(t))
    {
      ... use wm hints
    }
    else
    {
      ... use old position
    }
  }
  else
  {
    if (IS_ICON_MOVED(t))
    {
      ... default to old position
      do_ignore_icon_boxes = True;
    }
    else
    {
      do_ignore_icon_boxes = False;
    }
    ... handle icon boxes, avoid overlapping icons etc.
  }

Bye

Dominik ^_^

I'm signing off the fvwm list, because my mailbox is full
enough and I don't have a lot to contribute.  But in departing,
let me say a big Thank You for the high-quality help I received
in resolving one of the few problems I've ever had with fvwm.
It confirms me in my belief that fvwm is the smart choice for
window managers for a GNU/Linux system.

Two questions with FVWM2.2.2:

1) I can not lock the screen. To leave my desk for a while I have
to close all applications and logout.
2) There is not status bar. If I minimize a screen, it will
disappear. I can not get it back.

the window manager doesn't handle locking try 
man xlock or man xscreensaver

Huh?? I don't understand your question, do you mean you minimize a window and don't get an icon??.  If that is the case you, need to set up you .fvwm2rc to give you icons, try man fvwm2 and look for icons

Hi,

	I'd just like to thank Luke for asking about these questions, as
since I've subscribed to this list a week ago, the majority of the
questions - and especially the answers - have been very technical, at
least from the perspective of someone not very knowledgeable about Linux,
and FVWM. ( Not that I'm complaining of course - these are still helpful
even to me, and I'm still taking notes :) )

	But to the point of my posting - I'd just like to add a quick
question about this kind of visual config - is there any config manager
for that kind of thing, like Linuxconf for the system config? I've been
pottering around in my system for a while now, and I've found dozens of
likely suspects, but keep hitting dead-ends, or what seem like them...

	Thanks and sorry if this is a bit obvious for the list,
	John

Go to the links page off of http://www.fvwm.org and find links to the
Dotfile Generator, which has a FVWM config module, and the FvwmConf
tool.

The next version of FVWM (2.4) will have some graphical dialogues for
very basic configuration of some of the modules.

There's also a link to tkgoodstuff which is an alternative to the
FvwmButtons module; the nice thing about this is you can completely
configure the buttonbar with graphical setup dialogues: make new
buttons, change colors, fonts, etc. etc.

There are also some other peoples' configurations, for hints.

Finally, though, it's important to realize that FVWM is just a window
manager.  It's _not_ a desktop environment.  If you're coming from the
MS-Windows or Macintosh world this can be a tricky mental transition.
X, in some ways at least, follows the UNIX tradition of having lots of
smaller tools that work together, rather than one huge tool that does
everything (there are several obvious exceptions :).

The disadvantage to this is you sometimes have to poke around to find
what you want.  The advantage is flexibility: you can combine these in
really new and unusual ways, or switch to a different one whenever you
want, etc.

Thus, one crucial tool for your desktop is a window manager--but a
window manager isn't a complete desktop.  The WM deals with
placing/moving/resizing/iconifying windows, and it controls which window
has the input focus.  That's _fundamentally_ all it does.  WM's like
FVWM have lots of fancy ways to do the above, but it's still the same.
The other common thing WM's do is control what happens when the root
window has focus, like providing popup menus, etc.

Thinks like screensavers, file managers, wallpaper managers, even task
bars (although some WMs build in the latter) are really not strictly the
purview of a window manager.

or man FvwmWinList if you want a task bar approach rather than loose
icons.

Yes please! I do hope that's something that could be considered.
FvwmButtons could look a *lot* better if you could add a gradiented
background to some buttons.

Hi all,

  I'm using fvwm 2.2 and have a small question.  Is there a way to
tell the iconman to change to color of a specific window according to
the window icon?  What I want to accomplish is that when I change to
root user, the window background in the iconman will turn red.  Is it
possible?

Thanks,

  Dan

I'm not sure I understand your question. "Change to root user" where?
There's no way I'm aware of to change the owner of an X window. You
mean like if you 'su - root' in an xterm?

In any event, even if there were, FvwmIconMan doesn't care who owns
the windows it looks after. And FvwmIconMan also doesn't know how to
display a specific button differently than all the others, except to
indicate which button has the focus and which one you're currently
selecting in FvwmIconMan. So, I *think* the answer to your question is
no, but I'm not sure I've understood it.

Yes, I thought I was not asking clearly enough.  I currently have 5
instances of iconman on my screen - each deals with a different type
of window.  When the title of an xterm changes to "root@*" it moves
from one iconman to the other:

*FvwmIconMan*2*show       title=root*
*FvwmIconMan*5*show       class=XTerm class=NXTerm class=XWsh

guess it's not possible, too bad. :)  Thanks for the response though.

Ah, but if *that's* what you're doing, you can set:

*FvwmIconMan*2*plainbutton flat black red

See the entries for plainbutton, focusbutton, selectbutton and
focuselectbutton (or was it selectfocusbutton?) in the manpage.

You can, it's just a little bit more work...

In my setup, I use "*FvwmButtonsPixmap" to specify a Background pixmap
for all the buttons.  This pixmap is simply a gradient created by
"bggen" (a progam that comes with "xv").

Hope this helps,

Taht is no problem. You have to start the 'root' FvwmIconMan under
a different name like 'FvwmRootIconMan' (create a symbolic link to
the original icon manager). Then simply use the different prefix
for an independent configuration of the icon manager:

 *FvwmRootIconMan...

Unfortunately, this only works if all your buttons have the same size,
doesn't it?

Well, all my buttons have the same size, so I simply don't know what
FvwmButtons does if the pixmap is too small or too large.  I guess it
will be truncated or repeated.  Just try it.

With an old version of FvwmButtons (before the ...Pixmap option was
introduced) I used some Button-Pixmpas with their own background.
Of course, it's even more work to create those things, and you have to
recreate them every time you decide to change the size of your
buttons...

Use:  --without-cxx
on your configure line.  C++ is only used for one (or two?) of the
modules in the "extras" directory, and not needed for general purpose
fvwm.

Hello.

I am using fvwm2 over gnome, ( a customized version obtained from a link
in www.WHATISTHENAMEOFTHETUCOWSVERSIONOFLINUX.com )

Well, Every time I start an app, a "shadow" window comes up over my mouse,
and I just click wherever I want the window on my desktop.

I want to disable that feature, I know there is a way but I dont know how.

Can somebdy please point me in the right direction?

Regards

Gustavo
