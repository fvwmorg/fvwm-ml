Just as a point of order, the clock could still ask for input focus, its just
that it isn't expecting the window manager to give it focus. If the
WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom is present in the WM_PROTOCOLS property then if could be in
"globally active mode" which according to my ICCCM means that it will
explicitly take input focus when it wants it. 

As usual our customer has a different perception of how things should work and
wants us to only every transfer focus to windows when they open or by clicking
into a textfield contained in such windows. You can press buttons/menus etc in
other windows but still keep typing in the original window. I've used this
globally active mode to achieve the required result.

The reason why I bring this up is that fvwm doesnt seem to behave the way I
would expect it to. It all works fine under the window manager we will be
using, but I suspect fvwm doesnt like other programs moving the focus around.

One more question: Does the 'exec' builtin need a '&' at the end?

This:		exec xterm &
Or this:	exec xterm

Fvwm Users,

I am new to Fvwm.  It's my first day of using it after years of Sun's
Open Windows.  I am busy reading through web pages, man pages, etc.
However, I have a few questions that I need answered to make life bearable.

Q1: Open Windows used to have a pin on popup windows that you could "tack down"
so that the window would not go away when pushing a button.  How do I keep
popup windows from disappearing in Fvwm?

Q2: How do I get Fvwm to just open a new window anywhere instead of putting
up the rubber-band box and allowing me to place it?

Q3: Does anyone have a .fvwmrc for Sun Open Windows or Microsoft Windows-95
look-alike setup?

Thanks,

Mark Hamby

Currently not implemented, but it's on the 2.xx TO-DO list as a
possible future enhancement.

Mark> Q2: How do I get Fvwm to just open a new window anywhere instead
Mark> of putting up the rubber-band box and allowing me to place it?

Well, this is in the man pages (taken from the 2.xx man page):

               RandomPlacement causes windows which would normally
               require user placement to be automatically placed in
               ever-so- slightly random locations.  For the best of
               all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and
               SmartPlacement.

               SmartPlacement causes windows which would normally
               require user placement to be automatically placed in a
               smart location - a location in which they do not
               overlap any other windows on the screen. If no such
               position can be found user placement or random
               placement will be used as a fall-back method.  For the
               best of all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement
               and SmartPlacement.

So, Are you using fvwm 1.xx or 2.xx?

1.xx

  # place windows in empty screen locations
  # but not over icons
  StubbornPlacement
  SmartPlacement
  # and place randomly if not enough empty screen
  RandomPlacement

2.xx

  Style "*"           RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement

That should do the trick.

Mark> Q3: Does anyone have a .fvwmrc for Sun Open Windows or Microsoft
Mark> Windows-95 look-alike setup?

Currently fvwm cannot be made to really look like either of these.

Personally, I think it's worth putting in the '&'. It can't hurt, can it?
For OpenWin apps, I use toolwait instead (e.g., "Exec toolwait xrolo"). I
haven't tried it with other applications, but it probably works for them too.

However, this reminds me about a question I had. Do you need the "exec"? 
I've been leaving it out with no problem. E.g.:

AddToMenu Games		"Boing" 	Exec xboing &
+			"Doom"		Exec sunxdoom -2 &
+			"Hearts"	Exec xhearts &
+			"Mahjongg"	Exec mahjongg -P -C > /dev/null &
+			"Minesweeper"	Exec xvmines > /dev/null &
+			"Solitaire"	Exec exec xsol &

I have tried all of the following methods and can see no difference.
Does anyone know the advantages/disadvantages of any of the following:

AddToMenu Games		"Boing" 	Exec exec xboing &
+			"Boing2" 	Exec xboing &
+			"Boing3" 	Exec xboing

I will use the last if I can not find an valid reason not to.

Hi Bret,

here's my .fvwm2rc... it's got some pixmaps that don't come with the

Does anyone have patches for mini icon buttons for 1.24r? Or is this 
reason enough to switch now? I've got 5 machines running 1.24r, and have 
a lot of time invested getting .fvwmrc "just right." I looked at pl36, 
but didn't have the time to do a lot of playing... but two of my users 
are intrigued by the idea of tiny button decorations.

I have noticed a couple bugs in FVWM 2.0 pl 37. I thought you might like to
hear about them.

The first occured on our DecStation 5000 machines. FVWM core dumps when it
can not find a font specified in the .rc file. So if you specify it
incorrectly or something.

The second has to do with the FwvmIconBox module. I was trying to get rid
of the icons and only have the titles of the icons show up in the icon
box. I prefer this because I don't want the icons to take up huge amounts
of room. Anyway, when I set the resource:

*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 64x0

I get error messages of the following:

Error in FvwmIconBox:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
Major opcode of failed request:  66 
Resource id of failed request:  0x300001c 

I get one of these for each icon that gets drawn.

To avoid this I have to specify a size of 64x1 which looks really stupid
because it adds the shaded edges. :( Oh well, it is purely cosmetic and I
can live with it. :)

Thought someone would like to know.

Hi,

I would like to know if there is any way to make icons remember their 
positions. What I mean is the following:
(1) I open an application
(2) I iconify it
(3) I deiconify it
(4) I iconify it again - it should go to the same place as before even 
though there may exist an empty placy nearer to the corner.

Any help will be appreciated.

Hi everybody!

I noticed that the shadows used by fvwm for shadow effects are much
brighter than what Motif of Xaw3d yield. I guess it comes from the
lines 

  
  r = bg_color.red % 0xffff;
  g = bg_color.green % 0xffff;
  b = bg_color.blue % 0xffff;
  
  r = r >>1;
  g = g >>1;
  b = b >>1;
  
  bg_color.red = r;
  bg_color.green = g;
  bg_color.blue = b;


in fvwm/colors.c, or similar snippets in modules. I'd like to see a
common function in libfvwm.a that uses a Contrast setting (either a
global setting in .fvwmrc or a compile time setting in
configure.h). Then we could have something like

  bg_color.red = (unsigned short)((bg_color.red*CONTRAST)/100);
  bg_color.green = (unsigned short)((bg_color.green*CONTRAST)/100);
  bg_color.blue = (unsigned short)((bg_color.blue*CONTRAST)/100);
  

Concerning the darker shadows, they seem to be always black. A similar
algorithm would be welcome. I don't know whether we can grab code from
Xaw3d and adapt it (Copyright problems, maybe?).

Anyway, I tried to change these things myself and, as expected, got
no satisfactory result. That's why I transmit this idea to the list.

Jean-Marc.

Whenever I iconify a window I see a very noticable delay (from 2 all the
way up to 7 or 10 seconds) between the time the window disappears and
the time the icon appears.

During that time FVWM is just frozen there and won't accept any input,
no window has focus, etc.  It's really annoying.

I wonder if it might be the delay needed to find/load/setup the pixmap
for the icon?  They're stored on an NFS filesystem that can be slow
sometimes.  If so, I wonder if any thought has been given to caching
pixmaps (I only use about 10 pixmaps) so they don't need to be reloaded
each time?

Or is this delay due to something else?  What is going on between the
time the window disappears and the icon appears?

I've got a setup where I have two physical displays: 0.0 and 0.1.  I would
*really* like to be able to start up different things (e.g. different versions
of FvwmButtons) depending upon which display I'm using.  I can't seem to force
either FvwmCpp or FvmwM4 to do what I want (or maybe I'm just stupid).

The initial version of FvwmForm suffered even more than the core and
other modules with a poor algorithm for selecting shades.  I submitted
a patch to it which, amongst other things, adopted the shading algorithm
from TK (John Ousterhout's window environment for TCL) which is one of
the best I've come across it.  This patch has been integrated into the
distribution version for quite a while now.

It would be good to move this code into libfvwm as a lot of modules try
and maintain a similar looking 3d effect to the core - common code is
the best way to do it.

I doubt if there's any copyright problems.  TCL and TK have very liberal
copyright and we're only poaching about 15 lines of code from it.

This is a bit off topic, but some people might find it interesting.

There is a win95look patch to bowman, which is a window manager originally
based on fvwm 1.24r.  Bowman is a NeXTSTEP lookalike with fvwm-1.24esque
rc file.  win95look is a patch pp@friendly.netppl.fi (Pekka Pietik{inen)
made as a joke for bowman.  You can find bowman at

  http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~byang/bowman/

and the win95look at

  ftp://ftp.netppl.fi/pub/linux/win95look/

Since I don't use win95, I don't know how close this is to "the real thing".

I don't think PP is planning to port this to fvwm 2.0 (yet), but he did
mention that he's interested to know if people like it.  So email him
praises if you like it.  :-)

James.

When I asked this question, I really was concerned about work-alike, not
necessarily look-alike.  Most users can almost instantaneously convert to a
new look as long as the icons, buttons, etc. are either similar or functionally
obvious.  However, it takes much longer for users to acclimate to changes in
the functions of mouse movements, buttons, key strokes, changes in window/menu
organization.  I was really interested in a .fvwmrc that provided a 
functionally similar environment to Open Windows and/or Windows-95.

I am VERY new to FVWM (2 days), but have find very few functions in Open
Windows that cannot be mimicked in FVWM.  The only one thus far that I have
found is the ability to "pin" transient windows to the desktop so that they
do not go away when a button on them is clicked.  This is a severe problem
for me as I run many OpenLook-based programs and have considered abandoning 
FVWM due to the lack of this feature.

FVWM is a wonderful (I repeat, wonderful) window manager.  But it still has
many deficiencies such as poor configuration/build procedures, 
obsolete/missing/poor documentation,  the lack of a good/standardized/commented 
system .fvwmrc, and several missing "It would be nice if..." features.

I would like to see efforts, including mine, be put into these problem areas
instead of making FVWM "look just like Windows-95."  I hope I have clarified
my inquiries.  No offense to Charles Hines on the excellant work he has done,
to Windows-95 afficionados, or to anyone else I might have pissed off. ;-)

Later,

Mark

Hi,
I just began to use the version 2.xx of Fvwm (2.0.38) and have some
inconveniency with some module's behavior.

1) FvwmIconBox
This is too restricted to fetch the icons within itself.
e.g. with style option "Icon ...", any programs won't go into it.

I suggest another Style (or IconBox) option like `FvwmIconBoxHit'
(or if this  is IconBox option `FvwmIconBoxHit <program name>')
should be added to Fvwm 2.xx.

2) FvwmScroll
This fancy function looks like very useful except that it always resize
the target window to the size consistently defined.

It is eagerly demanded that an option like "FvwmScrollSize x y"
at which x & y are the percentage of a full screen will be added
to FvwmScroll.

Sincerely,

-- yamamoto

I am a new fvwm user, so far things have been going great.  I am on a Sparc
 workstation.  I just started getting the following message:

xnews: Warning: input queue lock broken!

whenever I try to exit a xterm.  It happens if I type exit at the command line
 and if I just close the window.  It doesn't do this every time though.  Any
 ideas?

Also, what are the major differences from fvwm 1.x to the 2.x?  I've looked at
 some of the web pages and at some .fvwm2rc files.  There just seems to be
 syntax differences.

Thanks,
Kevin

Hi,

I think there may be a little bug in the handling of the MWMButton
flag - the manpages says that setting it should cause the maximise
button to appear sunk in when the window is maximised.

However, my buttons are as follows:

| Close | WindowOps                        Maximise | Iconise |

In this case, my Iconise button says sunk in.  I suspect fvwm doesn't
try to find the maximise button, but just sinks in button 2
regardless.

Is this the right thing to happen - or have I misunderstood the
purpose of MWMButton ?

Im'm using fvwm2-pl38

Thanks,
Austin

Hi,

The icon handling seems to have changed quite a bit in fvwm2.  Having
IconBoxes specifiable on a per icon basis is nice!

However, as far as I can see, it's now impossible to get the same
effect as StubbornIconPlacement used to - ie icons won't place
themselves under windows. The FAQ just says "(obsoleted)" - but it
doesn't mention how to get the same effect.

Would it be possible to have a style line saying how space for an icon
is to be searched for ?

Eg:

style "*" IconPlacement "IconBox&Visible, Anywhere&Visible, IconBox,
               Here, Anywhere"

(the "&Visible" suffix can be added to any condition).  I would
suggest that this line means use:

 (1) the iconbox if there's room in it & the icon wouldn't be under a
     window (invisible) or on top of another icon; otherwise:

 (2) anywhere, so long as the icon's visible and not on top of
     another; otherwise:

 (3) the iconbox if there's room and it wouldn't be on top of another;
     otherwise:

 (4) centered on the inconified window's previous location, if it
     wouldn't be on top of another icon; otherwise:

 (5) (getting desperate here:) just plonk it down anywhere - never mind
     if it hides another icon or is hidden by a window!



This scheme would give people the flexibility to have their icon's
dropped where they expect them. fvwm-1.24r used a placement scheme as
I've just suggested, but hard wired.  fvwm2 uses

Style "*" IconPlacement "IconBox, Here"

(I think)



Also, I think it's the case that fvwm2 doesn't allow you to overflow
an iconbox into another, like fvwm-1.24 used to.  I think this is a
wonderful feature, and miss it :)   Can the syntax for IconBox be
expanded to take multiple 4-tuples describing a series of boxes ?


I'll have a look at the icon placement code, to see how easy it might
be to generalise things...

Cheers,
Austin

>From the ChangeLog in 2.0.38:

	6. FvwmButtons now handles Exec "" foobar correctly.

We have not found this to be the case. In fact,
	Exec foobar
was also broken, and only
	Exec "name" foobar
seemed to work.

The attached patch corrects the problem.

Ages ago I submitted a patch to put the screen number as a constant for the
FvwmCpp program. As a result I now run fvwm using:

fvwm-pre-2.0 -f "FvwmCpp .fvwmrc2"

and in my .fvwmrc2 file I can control the position of the pager using:

#if SCREEN==1
*FvwmPagerGeometry 180x88-1+925
#else
*FvwmPagerGeometry 180x88-310+925
#endif

Seems to work for me.

Hi,

I've noticed that different window managers respond differently to the
XMoveWindow call.

twm and fvwm will place the upper-left corner of the client window at the
coordinate specified, while mwm and vuewm will place the upper left
corner of the border at the specified coordinate.

The behaviour described in the man page for XMoveWindow corresponds to
the mwm method.

Is there a way to tell fvwm to use this scheme?

Best regards,

Mats Nilsson

I'm normally starting up vuewm, but sometimes I want to switch to fvwm
on both screens. I'm doing it like this (excuse my poor style):

	#! /bin/csh
	# Kill all vuewm
	@ v = `ps -e | grep vuewm | wc -l`
	if ($v > 0) then
	  ps -e | grep vuewm | awk '{print "kill -9 " $1}' | sh
  
	  # restart fvwm2 
	  @ num = `grep dev /usr/lib/X11/X0screens | grep -v "#" | wc -l`
	  set host = `uname -n`
	  if ($num > 1) then
	    @ num--
	    while( $num > -1 )
	      set disp = $host":0.$num"
	      fvwm2 -d $disp -s -f "FvwmCpp -Cppprog /lib/cpp -Cppopt \
		-DSCREEN$num .fvwm2rc" >& /dev/null &
	      @ num --
	    end
	  else
	    fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp -Cppprog /lib/cpp .fvwm2rc" >& /dev/null &
	  endif
	endif

and formatting my .fvwm2rc in accordance with normal cpp rules:

	#ifdef SCREEN0
	/* these options go on screen 0 */
	*FvwmButtons emacs - Exec "" exec /usr/local/bin/emacs &
	#endif

	#ifdef SCREEN1
	/* these options is for screen 1 */
	*FvwmButtons xemacs - Exec "" exec /usr/local/bin/xemacs &
	#endif

	#if !defined(SCREEN0) && !defined(SCREEN1)
	/* these options are used on a single screen configuration */
	#endif

Best Regards,

Mats Nilsson

Does anyone know why FvwmAuto doesn't raise the window that has focus when
a new window comes up & happens to land partially over my focused window?

Chuck, please don't unconditionally change this behavior.  I wouldn't
want the new window to be obscured.

What does everybody else think?

Hi!

After a lot of trouble getting fvwm2 to run on my SGI at all, it
is finally up and running beautifully.

While playing around with it, I found a few bugs, that you guys
might be interested in:

1.) .fvwm2rc:
    I get a coredump right after fvwm2 starts, when I ask for this:
AddToFunc XSETROOT_s "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0
AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

    But it works fine when I ask for this:
AddToFunc XSETROOT_s "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0
AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8

    I checked the man page for fvwm2 and it says $0 - $9 is fine, though.

2.) FvwmWinList: 
    *truncateleft doesn't work.  It still truncates right.

3.) FvwmTalk:
    It doesn't accept module specifications like "*FvwmWinListUseIconNames"
    The error message is:
      "No such module /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2 *FvwmWinListUseIconNames"

4.) Okay, here is a tricky one:
    In my .fvwm2rc I got:
Key Up          A       SC      CursorMove  0 -1
Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove  0 +1
Key Up          A       SM      CursorMove  0  -10
Key Down        A       SM      CursorMove  0  +10

    This works beautifully, unless a (popup) menu is open.  In that
    case Shift-Control-<cursor> acts just like Shift-Meta-<cursor>.
    Apparently the Meta-Flag is set while a menu is open.  Strange.

5.) This is not a bug, but two questions:
    a) Did fvwm1's 'Cursor' command disappear completely, or is it
       just hidden somewhere?  If it's gone, why?
    b) What about fvwm1's commands "AppsBackingStore" and "BackingStore"?
       Are the gone, too?  Why?

6.) Another question, but more tricky I am afraid:
    How can I specify that an iconified FvwmPager always opens up
    at -1+1 ?  In order to simulate the old builtin pager, I got this:
AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmPager 0 1
*FvwmPagerHilight lightsteelblue
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1
*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Standard
*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Extended
*FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35
*FvwmPagerStartIconic

    It starts up iconic, just like I want to have it, but of course
    it always shows up where all the other icons are, too.  But I
    want to have it at the upper right corner.  Is that possible?

7.) Finally I would like to second the wish for "OpaqueResize", and
    my personal wish would be a window-specific AutoRaise command/module,
    like a style-command or so.

Besides that, you guys really did a wonderful job!!!
Keep up the good work, and thanks a lot!

Ciao,
 Andy.

Ok, I edited the configure.h, and everything worked, considering I didn't
change the paths at all...

However, in FvwmConfig, the makefile expects to find '../../libs/libfvwm2.a'
whereas '../../libs/libfvwm.a' is actually generated.

Just a little 'oops' I thought I'd point out.

I rather like the idea of keeping the focused window on top.  It happens
to me all the time that I have to take time out to get back my original
window so I can finish up somthing before going to the new one.

( currently running fvwm 2.0 pl 38 on Solaris )

Has anyone noticed problems with the FvwmPager?  What happens is 
that it dies if you move a window over another window.  It is 
*very* intermittent.  A friend told me it was happening to him 
and it took me a while to reproduce it.  

I brought up a big FvwmPager ( I keep a small one with a single 
desktop swallowed into GoodStuff/FvwmButtons ) and made 6 rxvt 
windows.  I moved one of them around a few times onto different 
pages, always putting it on top of another window.  About the 
8 or 9'th time, FvwmPager died and I got the following:

 X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  5512
  Current serial number in output stream:  5535 

I started another FvwmPager.  This time it took about 30 moves 
to get the same thing again:

 X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  8187
  Current serial number in output stream:  8201  


One other problem is that when you resize the pager window 
sufficiently large, problems appear in the drawing.  The 
lines at the tops of some desktops disappear ( in spots ). 
Sometimes a phantom block the color of the background 
and slightly larger than a desktop appears in the middle.

Yes I have had the same problems.  It is very difficult to reproduce
consistently though.  I seem to get it moving icons inbetween desktops.

There is a 'Destroy' for destroying an app, a 'DestroyMenu' for removing
and re-creating menus, but is there a possibility there could also be a
'DestroyFunc' such that One could theoretically destroy all functions but
the current one, some silly stub function that has all the 'DestroyFunc' 's in
it, then for people like me who keep funcs in a separate file, say
'Read ~/.fvwm/fvwm-funcs' and the 'name' to this menuitem be: 'Re-read funcs'?

A suggstion, incase it's not already been made..

Thanks,

I smile, because I probably shouldn't be able
to do this, but a question, how would I without
typing the following command in the FvwmTalk
window?


    DestroyMenu ReReadIt
    AddToMenu ReReadIt "*fvwm2.xpm*" Nop
    + "Re-Read Menus" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-menus

I have all my menus in 'fvwm-menus'
and every 'AddToMenu' is preceeded by a
DestroyMenu <menuname>

as in the above example.  I have a feeling that
fvwm is seg-faulting because it destroyed a menu
it wasn't done with.

So, is the above possible?  Somehow, I think it
should be possible to re-load menus w/out restarting
fvwm, and it is through FvwmTalk, but I would like
to to do it off of a menuitem.  I guess I could put
a button on 'FvwmButtons', but humor me a little;
is it possible to reload menus from a menu option?

(my gut feeling is no; a to-do list item in this case?)

I think it's be a nice entry to add TO-DO list (But I don't know who
does :-). And, anybody have experience about shared library ? I do not
use OS has shlib, but if so, it's cool. It may leads to "creating
environment for fvwm's module development".

Speaking about modules, how many modules are there in the world which
is not included fvwm distributions ? I already have FvwmAdlLog,
FvwmIconMan-0.2, FvwmWish-0.8, fvwish-1.0, and tkfvwm0.5. Any other
modules ?

Hello Everyone,

I just recently discovered fvwm and am trying to install it on a
SunOS 4.1.2 1 sun4c, which is a fairly common architecture.

When I try to compile fvwm 1.24 or fvwm 2.0b there are hundreds of
errors of this type...
 
cc -O -pipe           -c CatString3.c -o CatString3.o
"CatString3.c", line 12: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"CatString3.c", line 14: a undefined
"CatString3.c", line 14: b undefined
"CatString3.c", line 14: c undefined
 
and 

./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 1: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 2: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 3: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 4: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 5: syntax error at or near type word "int"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 6: syntax error at or near type word "int"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 7: syntax error at or near type word "int"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 8: syntax error at or near type word "char"
"./../../libs/fvwmlib.h", line 9: syntax error at or near type word "int"

Is this because I am specifying the cc compiler instead of gcc? 

I also attempted to install libXpm to get the color icons but got this
error

(cd .; ld -o ./libXpm.so.3.0~ -assert pure-text data.o create.o
misc.o rgb.o scan.o parse.o hashtable.o XpmCrBufFrI.o XpmCrDataFrP.o
XpmCrPFrBuf.o XpmRdFToI.o XpmWrFFrI.o XpmCrBufFrP.o XpmCrIFrBuf.o
XpmCrPFrData.o XpmRdFToP.o XpmWrFFrP.o XpmCrDataFrI.o XpmCrIFrData.o
XpmRdFToData.o XpmWrFFrData.o )
ld: unrecognized -a option `ssert'
make[1]: *** [libXpm.so.3.0] Error 1

I am using the gnu ld, and there is no -assert option.  Is -format
the correct substitution for -assert?  Is gcc also necessary when
compiling libXpm?

One last question, what is the latest stable version of fvwm? 
Everything I read on the www or at ftp sites says something
different.  Is there a non-beta release of fvwm 2.0 and where could
I get it?






Thanks,

Chad

chadc> Is this because I am specifying the cc compiler instead of gcc? 

You cannot compile fvwm with cc which comes from SunOS 4.1.x
(I think it should be listed to FAQ, but not yet).

chadc> One last question, what is the latest stable version of fvwm? 

Latest version is pre-2.0-patchlevel-38, and you can found it as
"fvwm-2.0.38.tar.gz". But it's difficult to decide what's the latest
STABLE version...

Hm.  I can't reproduce these problems.  I'll keep trying though.  And
if you come up with a consistent way to reproduce them, let me know.

Howdy all,

Last week I said that I was finially able to reproduce the startup
lockup problems that people were having after I upgraded my Linux box
at home.

Well, turns out I lied.

I forgot to change a symbolic link and was running an older version
that had several bugs in it, but after I changed that symbolic link so
I was running the correct (latest) version, the problems went away.
So, I still can't reproduce them.  But I'll keep trying.

DestroyMenu will also Destroy a function, so you could have a
maximize function:

AddToFunc Maximize-Func		"M" Maximize	 0 100
+				"C" Maximize	 0 80
+				"D" Maximize	 

and a menu item which reconfigures your maximize button 
AddToMenu	Window-Ops	"Reconfigure Maximize Button" read newmax

and newmax is a file which containts
DestroyMenu MaximizeFunc
AddToMenu Maximize-Func	"I"	Maximize 100 100


Note that it is also legitimate to destroy and reload menus this way; just 
don't destroy the menu/function that you're currently working with.

The latest 'stable' version is 1.24r.  2.xx has not been officially
released and is still in the beta state, which by definition is not
stable...

Hello,
I have a problem in using the fvwm on SGI IRIX5.3.
I just tried the Version 1.24l and 2.0.38 and I
can't use the left and middle mouse button in
the root window and on icons.
The init-files define menus on these button on the root-window but nothing
happens.
Now follows the output from xwininfo, xprop and xdpyinfo for the root window:

clicking the

I second this.  I also keep my function and menu defs in a separate
file in the .fvwm directory.  Maybe we should adopt this as a new
standard for the configuration of fvwm.  This would make it even
easier to read.

Bye,

When I restart it's even longer.  Sometimes up to 10 seconds.
Very strange.

I am sending a copy of this to the Mailing List.  Maybe someone
else has experienced this, too.  Or maybe someone even knows a
work around.

BTW, my .fvwm2rc is pretty long: 868 lines, 31577 characters.

Bye,
 Andy.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
Priority: non-urgent
X-Majordomo: 1.92
content-length: 2751

Currently, if we don't want sorted icons (ie, don't specify
*FvwmIconBoxSortIcons) then the new icons get placed at the beggining of
the list of icons. This causes lots of unnecessary redraws as all the icons
get pushed down the row (or col) of icons. I would like to see icons added
to the end of the row of icons rather than the beginning. I realized that
some people might like this behaviour so I would like to ask for a
configuration option for this.

Here is a concrete example of what I am talking about. Here is the part of
my .fvwmrc file that relates to the Icon box.

*FvwmIconBoxGeometry    13x1+0-0
*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 64x38
*FvwmIconBoxPadding     4
*FvwmIconBoxLines       13
*FvwmIconBoxSBWidth     8
*FvwmIconBoxPlacement   Left Bottom 
*FvwmIconBoxPixmap      background3.xpm
*FvwmIconBoxHideSC Horizontal
*FvwmIconBoxSetWMIconSize
*FvwmIconBoxHilightFocusWin
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       1       Click           RaiseLower
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       1       DoubleClick     Iconify -1, Focus
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       2       Click           Iconify -1, Focus
*FvwmIconBoxMouse       3       Click           Module FvwmIdent
*FvwmIconBoxKey         r       RaiseLower
*FvwmIconBoxKey         space   Iconify
*FvwmIconBoxKey         Return  Iconify -1, Focus
#*FvwmIconBoxKey         d       Close
*FvwmIconBoxKey         n       Next
*FvwmIconBoxKey         p       Prev

As you can see, I have a 1 row high icon box at the bottom of the screen
with placement of Left Bottom. Currently, when a new window pops up, it
gets placed at the left side of the icon box and pushes all the other icons
to the right. This causes the entire icon box to be redrawn (potentially
for a window that may only last for a couple of seconds.) What I would like
is a behaviour more consistant with MWM's icon box. This would add new
icons to the right side of the list (given this setup, other sides given
other setups). This would minimize the redraw and flashing when windows
come and go.

Thanks,
-Greg
PS: given the above setup I am having trouble clicking on icons. When I
place my pointer on top of an Icon and do a single click nothing
happens. If I do a double click then the Click action id activated. This
happens for all three buttons. I guess I should say that I have sloppy
focus enabled.

I'm with you, Kai: I much prefer the current behavior.  If anything,
please make this new behavior optional.

As an aside, I'm still seeing the "stubborn autoraise" problem I had
even after, at the suggestion of this list, upping my autoraise timeout
to 750 (from 500).  It's less frequent but I can still make it happen
somewhat consistently if I try :(.  Plus now I have to reset my whole
internal mouse/timing/raise clock :-/ :)

Surely there must be some solution to this?  Someone responded to my
last message saying that they thought it was a X timing issue, where
events were being delivered out-of-order from the X server.  Are we sure
this is the case?  Can it be tested?  I maintain a stubborn hope that
it's a bug in FVWM somewhere :)

I have compiled 1.3.34-38 on my pc (linux) and on a sun at school.  This 
is definately a behavior of Fvwm.  I commented on this in a recent mailing
to the list; maybe no one picked up on it.

Anyway, I find it quite annoying...Before, using version 1.23...when I
started X in Linux, I would get:

1) screen flash as the video card was probed
2) 'checkered' X background with the mouse pointer in the center
3) the background would be cleared if I ran 'xsetroot'...as fvwm started up..

Now, currently, I get:

1) screen flash as the video card was probed
2) 'checkered' X background with the mouse pointer in the center
3) the background is quicly cleared to black
4) the background in step 2 is re-drawn painstakingly slow, as if being loaded
   from swap (I have 8 mb ram)
5) the background would be cleared if I ran 'xsetroot'...as fvwm started up..

Is there a reason for steps 3 and 4?  I know they are a behavior of the recent
versions of fvwm, but as I asked earlier, why?

BTW, for what its worth, step 4 doesn't happen on the Suns, I don't know why..
nor when I export it to the sgi's or the rs6000 we have that can't compile
X apps...

It used to be that when one restarted fvwm, the apps would, one by one, get
their boarders 'removed' and then a pause and then one by one they'd get
boarders once more.  Now, the whole screen goes black, and everything must 
re-fresh itself as it gesta  boarder...

WHY?

Rob added some calls to black out the screen during window captures so
you wouldn't have to see all that happening.  I'm going to make it an
optional feature, I think, since I like to know that fvwm is actually
doing something during this blackout...

I think the "blackout while fvwm starts" feature is for avoiding
"unpredictable focus problem when fvwm starts up", i.e., when fvwm
starts, focus to nowhere (equal "focus to NoFocusWin"). But only Rob
knows the fact...

Kewel!  I was wondering why...now I know...and am glad you see fit to offer
it as a choice!

Actually, I think he did it for purely cosmetic reasons.  That window
that comes up obscuring everything else is never actually touched by
the window manager itself.  The NoFocus window is another window
entirely.

Actually, I thought that this would make things happen more quickly/smoothly.
While fvwm is adding borders, it keeps raising and lowering and
reparenting windows, which means that they get lots of expose events,
and they redraw a lot, many times unnecessarily, because they soon get
hidden again. I thought that the single black window covering everything would
keep these windows from getting unneede expose events, and minimize redraws.

Cunning idea!


How about this for the TODO list:

 * The colour could be made a configuration option.

 * A small (again, configurable) string (default: "Please wait...") be
   put up ?

 * That Rob's explanation be put in the FAQ. I'd always wondered why
   the screen went black.


Cheers,
Austin

I use a GlidePoint instead of a mouse and one thing I would like to do is to
specify which physical button I want to use for logical mouse buttons 1, 2,
and 3.  I don't like the default selections.  It doesn't look like there's
any way to do this with FVWM.  Am I right in this assumption?  If so, then
is there something else I can do to fix it?  Or, is this something that might
need a patch to FVWM?

Is there any way to make a particular window sticky on a particular
desktop, but only on that desktop? I couldn't deduce a syntax (if it's
even possible).

I'm thinking that XEmacs will soon have a global minibuffer (similar to
the old epoch one) and it would be cool to make it sticky on my XEmacs
dekstop (but only there and nowhere else).

Thanks,

Note that, if people find that the black intro screen is slowing things
down, then it is a mis-feature, and should just be removed. Also, if you
make the intro screen highly configurable, then it will take a while to read in
the options on how to display it, and it may become ineffective (or may
become even more irritating, depending on your perspective.)

I've noticed that if I include '&' in a menu-label, it causes the next
character to be underlined. I couldn't find anything about this in the man
page. It seems line a nice feature for people who want to simulate a Windows
type of menu.

But that's not what I want to do. I want to have the character '&' in my
menu-label. I've tried using '\' before it, but that doesn't work.

How can I use a literal '&' in a menu-label?

Use '&&'.  I'll see about getting that into the man page...

I use a tool called unclutter which makes the mouse disappear after a short
time of no movement.  It works pretty well with fvwm with two small
exceptions:

1. if the mouse is on a sticky frame.

2. if the mouse is over the text area of an icon (curiously it is not affected
over the graphic portion of the icon). 

The problem is that if you leave the mouse in one of these areas until it
disappears then the keys for fvwm are disabled even keys defined to be active
in every context.  Since moving the mouse brings the mouse back it is only a
minor nuisance.  Still if someone has any ideas that would be helpful.  I am
currently under 1.24r.  Maybe it could be converted to a module.  Or maybe
fvwm already has a feature that will do this.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance, dex


/*
 * unclutter: remove idle cursor image from screen so that it doesnt
 * obstruct the area you are looking at.
 * doesn't do it if cursor is in root window or a button is down.
 * Tries to cope with jitter if you have a mouse that twitches.
 * Unfortunately, clients like emacs set different text cursor
 * shapes depending on whether they have pointer focus or not.
 * Try to kid them with a synthetic EnterNotify event.
 * Whereas version 1 did a grab cursor, version 2 creates a small subwindow.
 * This may work better with some window managers.
 * Some servers return a Visibility event when the subwindow is mapped.
 * Sometimes this is Unobscured, or even FullyObscured. Ignore these and
 * rely on LeaveNotify events. (An InputOnly window is not supposed to get
 * visibility events.)

It seems several list members have received messages from fvwm-owner with no
subject and no content.  This were created when the sendmail running on the
list server went somewhat insane; it seems this happens from time to time
with (the incredibly buggy) Sun sendmail.  I wasn't trying to send out any
sort of subliminal message.

Can anyone tell me how to configure FVWM to allow things like popup
menus 
to come up with just a mouse button press, rather than what I have now 
(the default??) of having to press the button and move the mouse 
slightly.

e.g. I press button 1 on the background (without releasing it) and get 
nothing, I the move the mouse slightly, and get the Utilities popup. 
I'd 
like to not have to move.

Possible?  Any good reasons not to do it?

I would have thought that something like xset would hold the answer to this one,
the mouse button/GlidePoint button _low_level_ (i.e. hardware) configuration is
the responsibility of X, not of the window manager (at least that's how I
understand it!) ;-)

I don't know if it slows things down (it only takes a couple of seconds
on my machine, at the worst), but the black screen is bad from a user
interface point of view, since it scares people.  I think the idea of
hiding out the windows popping up and down and losing and getting borders
is a good one, for the ordinary user if not the debugger.  How about instead
of completely blacking out the screen, fvwm puts up a small info window:


	-----------------------
	|                     |
	|  Restarting Fvwm    |
	|                     |
	|  Please hold...     |
	|                     |
	-----------------------

Nicely centered and so on, of course.

Naturally, making it possible to configure the window manager and modules
without restarting would be even nicer... :-)

Of course it is `slowing` things down, mentally at least, time never
goes so slow when you have nothing to look at, even if it would take
longer time in seconds to not having the black-out, people will think
it takes shorter time because they see thing happening.

BTW do we really need the blackout on the first startup, I start with
a clean desktop, but what does your startup look like??

'FvwmTalk' is the 'manual' implementation of this; however, I've also
split my .fvwmrc into several files:

Are you using XFree86?  This sounds like the behavior caused by
"Emulate3buttons" in the config file, which is for emulating the
middle button with a two button mouse.  Upon pressing a button,
the X server would wait for another event to see if the other button
is pushed for middle button emulation.  Of course this would cause
that "delay" until another event happens, like motion.

BTW, fvwm menus pop up just fine for me under Solaris and Linux with
XFree86 (with no emulate3button set).

James.

hi all:

i just joined this list and i'm new to fvwm.  i gotta say though, that
i love it so far.  i'm trying to get my InitFunction working.  this is
what i have:

Function "InitFunction"
	Desk 	"I"	0 0
	Exec	"I"	xterm -name ${HNAME} -T ${HNAME}
	Wait	"I"	${HNAME}

	Desk 	"I"	0 1
	Exec	"I"	emacs -geometry 80x50+100+100&
        .
        .
        .
EndFunction

the problem is that it waits forever after starting my xterm.  wait
apparently doesn't make the substitution.  surely there's a way to
have this substitution done.

also, is there a way for wait to key on the class or resource name
instead of the window name?  that would be more general.

thanks a lot

/r/

I'm a very satisfied user of fvwm 1.24r for long time now and I've 
never noticed any screen blanking caused by fvwm.  My machine
is a stock Pentium-90 PC.  So I don't think, it might be too fast to notice
the dicussed effect.  

So I wonder whether the discussed feature has been added to fvwm
after the 1.24r release.

Well, I've now implemented this scheme.  The syntax has changed
slightly, the quotes (") being replaced by square brackets ([]).

Icon handling similar to fvwm-1.24 can be had by a line like:

Style "*" IconPlacement [IconBox&Visible, Anywhere&Visible, IconBox,
                      Anywhere, Here]


(line wrapped by me)


Could people please give my patches a spin, and see if I've left any
bugs ?

(patches are relative to fvwm-2.0pl38, gziped to save space)

Chuck, would you consider putting this patch into fvmw2 when it (the
patch) stabilises ?

Cheers,
Austin

Hi, this is particularly aimed at Chuck, but is open to anyone
else who can help.

Has any progress been made on the binding of mouse click events
to keys on the keyboard?

Just a reminder, in case the idea has been forgotten! (I haven't
seen any traffic on the subject for some time!)

Tara,
Ben.

Hi,
  I am using FVWM2 pre2.0pl35 and found some bugs. May be somebody knows
  workarounds for them ?

  Problem #1:

    If you are using some function like:
    
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise		"I" Raise
+				"M" Move

    that is bounded to the mouse, FVWM reacts to every small mouse
    movement, so in most cases it runs Move also. How can I fix this ?

  Problem #2:
 
    I worked with mwm before and I like to work with IconBox that contains
    only icon labels and not icons. But it is not like FvwmWinList,
    because it allowed to move labels inside IconBox by mouse and so,
    perform groupping of icons. How can I do this in FVWM ?

	I hate it.  I don't like fvwm's current black screen either.
I really wish there was a way to turn that off.

Don't know if youve heard this before.. but it is a (I think) new
feature for 2.0 or something the like :-) So you probably haven't
seen it..

Since many programs might ignore them anyways (since they would be
synthetic events) this may or may not make it in.  I will try to put
it in eventually though (I've been pretty busy w/ real work lately,
which is why I've been pretty quiet about things).

No, actually the reason you don't notice it is because it's a 2.xx
only feature.

Yup - see above.  It may be removed shortly though, since even though
it may speed things up a little, I think that it is giving the
appearance of starting up slowly.

Perhaps I'll make it conditionally compiled in or controlled by a new
command line option instead.

Sounds interesting.  I'll check it out and if it seems ok and non

But why did you change the "" to []?

Cosmetics mainly :)

In a variety of languages, lists are formed using square brackets. I
originally thought using "" would be easier because a tokeniser might
pass the entire quoted string on, but it turned out that the parsing
code in parse.c wasn't so dependant on tokenising as I had imagined.

If the entire parse code is due for a re-write, then "" might make
more sense.

Is there a way to make the Titlebar and the sizing borders different colors?
I'm trying to get a blue title bar with a grey border area.  I can't seem to
get the two seperated.  Any help is much appreciated.

May I ask you some questions ?

1) Why you remove 'the blackout window which is created when startup' ?

2) What's the default behavior, when no 'IconPlacement' is specified ?
   If nothing, how about setting up to:
	[IconBox&Visible, Anywhere&Visible, IconBox, Anywhere, Here]

3) How about writing manual entry of this feature :-)

Oops - sorry, I had taken out the screen blanking so as I could see
what I was doing with gdb.  It was for debugging purposes only. I
meant to take that out of the final patch I sent, but forgot.

It's Chuck's decision as to what to do about screen blanking.

It defaults to the fvwm2 default, ie [IconBox] (actually, it probably
_should_ default to [IconBox, Here]) The real question is what should
happen when the list runs out/the icon can't be placed.  Currently, it
gets dumped at whatever the previous value of (icon_x_loc, icon_y_loc)
was (usually the pointer location?)

I'll have a go...

What about making a copy of the root window and mapping that over 
everything. That way, it would appear as if all windows were just 
unmapped until things were ready.
I might be better to do this sort of thing in a module(?).

I have a bug(?) in my fvwmrc-file that prints the following line to
the console everytime I start a xterm from my 'desktop-menu':

fvwm: Execution of module failed: /home/jupiter/anarki/solaris/lib/fvwm2/

The definition for the menu I fire up my xterm from looks like:

AddToMenu Utilities "Utilities"     Title

uh... no.  I think that's probably a poor idea.  Just imagine: "La dee da,

And I think I've made a good one.  For the next patchlevel, screen
blanking will be off by default, but can be turned on by invoking
fvwm2 with the parameter '-blackout', and it will be documented.

This way, people won't be confused at first, and after reading the
docs they may decide to turn it back on again to see if they get any
speedup in startup.  And those of you that like the feature can leave
it on all the time.

Chuck

Hi,

   I've just converted from fvwm 1.24 to 2.0b38.  I never claimed to 
understand everything about 1.24, so my transition to 2.0 is even more
confusing.  Questions:

1) if modules in 2.0 don't exist (eg, GoodStuff and FvwmAuto) do I just
   fire up the 1.24 version?

2) I want applications ( like xterm windows, xloads, netscape) to always
   start up at initialization time.  How do I do this from within .fvwm2rc?
   Can I do this?  With version 1.24, I always launched my startup X apps
   into the background, before starting fvwm, from within .xinitrc.  This
   always caused me problems at shutdown time because xterms would not die
   nicely when fvwm did, hanging my console window.  I hope that I can do
   everything from within .fvwm2rc.  How?

I look forward to a FAQ posted on the FVWM webpage...

Nope.  Goodstuff has been replaced by FvwmButtons.  FvwmAuto is still

You can use "AddToFunc InitFunction" to start whatever you want.  Take
a look at the sample system.fvwmrc included in the distribution.

Jeff> I look forward to a FAQ posted on the FVWM webpage...

There is a FAQ in the 2.xx distribution, although I just realized that
I never put any explicit mention of GoodStuff being replaced in
there...  Take a look at it, and the man pages as well.

And please keep in mind that fvwm2 is still in a beta state and hasn't
been officially released yet.

X-Majordomo: 1.92
content-length: 1465

Sorry for bringing up an old (and thoroughly discussed) topic, but I
someone's brought to my attention what I believe is a new twist.

A classmate of mine wanted to have focus-follows-mouse, but be able to
click on a window to raise it.  So I suggested that he could use

  Mouse 1 WTSF A Raise

He tried it, and remarked (negatively) that the click wasn't passed
through to the application.  I replied that it was fvwm's standard
behavior.

I checked in the TO-DO file to make sure that it was there, but it
says

  - Add ClickToFocusDontPassClick style

I think that a more general style would be more useful; something
like: PassClick/NoPassClick.  PassClick would always pass a (possibly
modified) click to the application, whether fvwm was in click-to-focus
mode or not, and NoPassClick would ... well, wouldn't.

(Aside: something much more complicated could involve passing some
clicks but not others, but that seems like it would involve Style
options becoming functions.)

Of course, this is all awaiting the rewriting of the Style code.  :)

Any comments?

I'm 100% in favor of style commands being able to be included in
functions.

Hi all,

	fvwm2 seems stable enough to use as my window manager without needing to keep 
fvwm(1) around any longer.

	Can anyone tell me the directories and  files I need to delete to be rid of 
all traces of fvwm(1)?

Thank you.

Hi,

I tried FVWM 2 a while ago, [atleast 8 months] and at the time the
.rc files where uncompatable, I believe there is a coverter? If so what 
is the best way to move to version 2, and where can I get it? :)

Neil.

I saved the following shell script a while back, I think it came off a
newsgroup; not sure.  Use at your own risk, of course.

According to the header, this is "fvwmrc-to-2 1.7a":

We've just recently upgraded from pl 34 to pl 38 running under Solaris 2.4.

I'm suddenly seeing strange mouse behavior - it seems to get stuck at the window edges as I slide from 1 page into another. Sometimes it even gets stuck when entering an empty page. I have a desktop which consists of 4 pages in a horizontal row.

Sometimes it frees up after a delay but I can't identify a consistent behavior.

I've never seen this problem until switching to pl 38.  I'm not aware of any significant changes to EdgeResistance or EdgeScroll since pl 34.

Apologies if this has been discussed already - I've tried to keep up with the list.  Thanks for any suggestions.

Well there is a bug in the mouse behaviour which appears as soon
as one starts the window manager (or restarts it for that matter).

Then, one cannot move the mouse out of the current screen, no matter
what your edgeresistance is.  If you somehow move to another page
by some other means (some key triggered function, or the window map), and
then try, then all is well.

Perhaps this is causing your problem?

Oops.  Right you are.  I found this out about 20 minutes after posting
the script, when I decided to look at building fvwm2 again.  It didn't
work out the first time I tried, but that was several patches ago,
and I didn't have time to investigate, not to mention that I'm no X guru.

As I'm new to this list, what sort of systems are people out there running
fvwm2 on?  Anyone using Linux/elf/xfree-3.1.2?

Well, it doesn't work 100% of the time.  But it does provide a good

I personally use AIX & Linux (ELF & XFree86-3.1.2).  I have compiled &
run it once under SunOS as well.

I've seen others: Solaris, HP-UX, OSF/1 (I think), SGI, etc.

Personally I use linux/elf/XFree88-3.1.2, but I've compiled and used
fvwm extensively on HP700 and Solaris 2 mahcines.

Y'all,
   FYI, I'm running fvwm2 pl 38 on a HP 9000/715 with HP-UX 10.01.  I seen
a couple of wierd things.  When I've rolled the mouse from one screen to
another, the windows on the new screen will sometimes get confused about who
the focused window is, and toggle window focus back and forth rapidly.  Clicking
on a window title bar will calm it down.  I have "ColormapFocus FollowsMouse"
defined in .fvwm2rc.  But pretty good so far...

FVWM2.0.38 works for me on;
SunOS 4.1.* (Sun3 and Sun4)
SunOS 5.*
HP/UX 9.0*
AIX 3.5
IRIX 5.*
OSF/1 1.* 2.* 3.*
NetBSD 1.0a
Many flavored Xterms and PC's

It really should run on any thing that supports X11R5 or X11R6 based 
Xwindows.

Hi Folks,

I just wanted to announce a little contribution of my part for the
Fvwm-Window-manager. In fact, I didn't like all these different sizes
of the icons people could find everywhere, also not having a 3d look
in the icons displayed on the screen didn't please me. So I looked
around a bit and finally found some great looking icons, I also
created some of my own and included a little script for converting and
creating 3d-looking Icons. here's the README File I included.

You can find my package op:

ftp://pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de/pub/3dpixmaps/3d_pixmaps_0.1.tar.gz

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Folks,           Joerg Mertin <smurphy@stardust.bln.sub.org>
                    Better use:  <joerg@pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de>

* This is my Version 0.1 of 3d_pixmaps distribution.
  including pixmaps in 3d Look with their respective mini-pixmap

* These are not mine (Well not all). I first found a bunch, then created
my own ! This is no Commercial Product, free (For everyone to use) and
I take absolutely no warranty if anything bad happens to your system !
Like the monitor blowing up because it got too many Colours presented
a.s.o ...) ;)

* Just wanted to contribute a little bit to the fvwm-Stuff :)
In Fact, while parsing through different Unix-System, I discovered
some nice looking 3d_featured pixmaps. Unfortunatly they weren't
enough, so I decided to create some own.

* It happened to also have a 3d Template pixmap, which helped me to
create my own. Unfortunatly, I didn't manage to get the combine to
center the original pixmap onto the template, what I resolved by
resizing the original first. A bad sideeffect is, that it has some
quality losses after resizing :( If someone knows a better solution, 
let me know ;)

* To use the Make3dxpm you'll need the Marvellous Imagemagick-Package,
since the tools Make3dxpm uses are taken from there ...

* In fact, What I never liked with all the XPM's lying around, was their
different sizes so you could'nt get an arranged Desktop. So, "we" have to
decide  of a size for all icon's. I choosed 56x46 pixels, since the
Real-Good looking ones I found have this size :) and I wouldn't
destroy the good-looking by resizing them. Mini-Pixmaps are also
included from all existing pixmaps in this directory. 

* Be warned that these pixmaps let your X-Server working very hard and
it can takes almost to 1 minute to have a picture on the screen after
a startx. This on a i486-DX4-100MHz with 32 MB Ram.



TODO -
- I'm using these pixmaps (have a look at my system.fvwmrc file) on an
  16 bit Display, so it might be to much colours for 8 Bit
  displays. Unfortunatly, many programms don't want to create a
  Colourmap since many xpm's don't have a name. Have to fiddle arround a
  bit 'til I find a solution for it. When I found it, I'll reduce colour
  consumption to 50 Colours for all images.


TODO - for the Fvwm Programmers
- What I'd like the fvwm-Programmers to do is to find a way (Should be
  pretty easy though) to integrate the pixmap automatically from the
  name of the application.
  By example, instead of having: 
  +               "%mini.fvwm.xpm%FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  just insert:
  +               "FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  And fvwm knows that the pixmaps is FvwmConfig.xpm, and the mini.icon
  is mini.FvwmConfig.xpm
  This would mean a lot of Pixmap renaming, but at least, if you
  already got some pixmaps for an application, fvwm recognises it
  right away without users to fiddle around for integrating new
  pixmaps. Wouldn't it be a good idea ?

  
For any hints and good-ideas, email me ;)
Have fun ...

OK I've tried, and failed :-)

Can someone please make this into a fvwm2 .rc file for me ? :)

# Unfortunately, order does matter in this file
# The correct order for inserting configurations is:
# 1. Colors
# 2. Assorted configuration paramters such as ClickToFocus, or MWMBorders
# 3. Path setup (ModulePath, PixmapPath, IconPath)
# 4. Style settings, including the default style Style "*" ...
# 5. InitFunction and ResetFunction definitions.
# 6. Other Functions. Functions cannot be forward referenced from
#	other functions, but they can be backward referenced.
# 7. Menus definitions. Same caveats about forward referencing
# 8. Key and Mouse Bindings.
# 9. Module options.

# The order of steps 5, 6, and 7 is not critical, as long as there are
# no forward references to functions or menus.

# If you get it wrong, the most common problem is that color or font settings
# are ignored

###########################################################################
# set up the colors

# OK some people like bright clear colors on their window decorations.
# These people, I guess would mostly be from nice sunny/good weather places
# line California.

# StdForeColor 		Black
# StdBackColor		LightSkyBlue
# HiForeColor 		yellow
# HiBackColor		PeachPuff1
# PagerBackColor	BlanchedAlmond

# Me, I'm from Upstate New York, and live in New Hampshire, so I prefer
# these dark muddy colors...

# this is used for the selected window
HiForeColor 		Black
HiBackColor 		#c06077

#PagerBackColor		#5c54c0
#PagerForeColor		orchid

########################      FOCUS STUFF     ##############################
# Set windows to auto-raise after 750 milliseconds if you like it.
# Autoraise can sometimes obscure pop-up windows. Performance is now
# similar to olvwm's auto-raise feature.
#AutoRaise 750

# Normally, we'll be in focus-follows mouse mode, but uncomment this 
# for mwm-style click-to-focus
#ClickToFocus

########################      ICON STUFF     ##############################
# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature....
# This creates two icon boxes, one on the left side, then one on the
# bottom. Leaves room in the upper left for my clock and xbiff,
# room on the bottom for the Pager.
#IconBox -150 90 -5 -140
#IconBox 5 -140 -140 -5
IconBox -70 1 -1 -140

# If you uncomment this, and make sure that the WindowList is bound to
# something, it works pretty much like an icon manager.
#SuppressIcons

# StubbornIcons makes icons de-iconify into their original position on the
# desktop, instead of on the current page.
#StubbornIcons

# With AutoPlacement, icons will normally place themselves underneath active
# windows. This option changes that.
#StubbornIconPlacement

# If you want ALL you icons to follow you around the desktop (Sticky), try
# this
#StickyIcons

########################      MWM EMULATION     #######################
#
# My feeling is that everyone should use MWMDecorHints and MWMFunctionHints,
# since some applications depend on having the window manager respect them

# MWMFunction hints parses the function information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and prohibits use of these functions on the window. Appropriate
# portions of the window decorations are removed.
MWMFunctionHints

# MWM is kinda picky about what can be done to transients, and it was keeping
# me from iconifying some windows that I like to iconify, so here's an
# over-ride that will allow me to do the operation, even tough the menu
# item is shaded out.
MWMHintOverride

# MWMDecor hints parses the decoration information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and removes these decoratons from the window. This does not affect
# the functions that can be performed via the menus.
MWMDecorHints

# These are affect minor aspects for the look-and-feel.
# Sub-menus placement mwm-style?
MWMMenus
# mwm-style border reliefs (less deep than default fvwm) ?
MWMBorders
# Maximize button does mwm-inversion thingy
MWMButtons
########################      MISCELLANEOUS STUFF     #######################
# If you don't like the default 150 msec click delay for the complex functions
# change this and uncomment it.
#ClickTime 150

# OpaqueMove has a number (N) attached to it (default 5).
# if the window occupies less than N% of the screen, 
# then opaque move is used. 0 <= N <= 100
# OpaqueMove 100

# flip by whole pages on the edge of the screen.
EdgeScroll 100 100

# A modest delay before flipping pages seems to be nice...
# I thresh in a 50 pixel Move-resistance too, just so people
# can try it out.
EdgeResistance 250 50


########################      WINDOW PLACEMENT     #######################
# RandomPlacement prevents user interaction while placing windows:
# RandomPlacement

# SmartPlacement makes new windows pop-up in blank regions of screen 
# if possible, or falls back to random or interactive placement.
SmartPlacement

# With SmartPlacement, windows will normally place themselves over icons. 
# Uncomment this to change that.
#StubbornPlacement

# NoPPosition instructs fvwm to ignore the PPosition field in window 
# geometry hints. Emacs annoyingly sets PPosition to (0,0)!
NoPPosition


########################      DECORATIONS     #######################
# If you want decorated transient windows, uncomment this:
DecorateTransients


###########################################################################
# Set up the virtual desktop and pager

#set the desk top size in units of physical screen size
DeskTopSize 2x2

# and the reduction scale used for the panner/pager

Only if there's a way to turn it off.  Pixmaps look great in my
iconbox and in FvwmButtons.  I don't want them in my menus.

The situation:

   I run 'xlock -blank' so as to not annoy my rommate when I
   go to bed.  I get a white screen.

The details:

   (relevent portions of files read by .fvwmrc: )

   ColormapFocus FollowsFocus
   Style "*" SloppyFocus

which results in I can have my mouse over, netscape, or xdoom, and move it
away, and the colormap doesn't shift and I don't have to keep the mouse in
the window...

However, when I run xlock, to brin the menu up from the backgorund, momentarily,
the pallette switches from the netscape pallete to the 'normal' "fvwm's" 
colormap, and then back to the netscape colormap as I release the xlock
menuitem, as it should.

However, running 'xlock -install' does not allow 'xlock -install -mode blank'
to show a 'blank, black' screen, instead a palette-shifted blazing white!

Is this the wm or xlock's problem?

Hi, y'all!

In fvwm2's (pl38) man page I read:

     WindowsDesk new_desk
          Moves the selected window the the desktop specified
          as new_desk.

Can someone please show me how to use this function?

I tried to bind it to Shift-Meta-MouseButton1 like this:
 Mouse 1		WTSFI  	SM	WindowsDesk 1
and like this:
 Mouse 1		WTSFI  	SM	WindowsDesk Desk_1
but neither seem to work.

Thanks in advance,
 Andy.

PS: Chuck, could you please tell me if this reached you?  Somehow I get
    the feeling that it might not reach you since you never replied to
    any of my bug-reports/questions.  Thanks.
PPS: Ceterum censeo:  I absolutely love FVWM.  Great work, FVWM team!

I meant to respond to Joerg's note yesterday, but didn't get a chance.

While some people might like this, I don't intend to put anything like
this in to FVWM.  I don't think that it's a good idea, because not
everyone will want it and the facility to put the pixmaps in if wanted
is already in there, so I see no need to change it.  Sorry.

A pointer to Joerg's 3d pixmaps will make it into the FAQ though.  And
a few of them might make it into the distribution.  I haven't looked
at them yet, but I'll probably put a few in there.  I don't want to
put all of them in there, as there are quite a bit.

Thanks,
Chuck

just tried it out.  I entered WindowsDesk 1 into FvwmTalk, and the
cursor changed to prompt me to select a window, which I did, and it
moved to desk 1.

Andy> I tried to bind it to Shift-Meta-MouseButton1 like this:
Andy>  Mouse 1          WTSFI   SM      WindowsDesk 1
Andy> and like this:
Andy>  Mouse 1          WTSFI   SM      WindowsDesk Desk_1
Andy> but neither seem to work.

I tried binding it like so:

Mouse 3 A       C       WindowsDesk 1

And that worked fine for me.  I don't see any problems with your
lines, but perhaps your Mouse definition above conflicts with another
one you have set up?  Also, the 2nd wouldn't work (Desks are numbers).

Andy> PS: Chuck, could you please tell me if this reached you?
Andy>     Somehow I get the feeling that it might not reach you since
Andy>     you never replied to any of my bug-reports/questions.
Andy>     Thanks.

Really?  I'm certain that I've seen notes from you in the past, and if
I've forgotten or neglected to respond (to you or to anyone else), I
appologize.  I try to respond to as many notes as I can (especially
bug reports), but having a "real job" makes it difficult sometimes.  I
usually save the notes that come in for a while though - I'll look
back over them and see if I have any of yours that I haven't
addressed.

BTW - I'm going to be silent for the next few days (starting tonight),
as I'm being moved to another building on a another nearby IBM site.
So I'll have to wade through whatever mail I get this weekend sometime
next week, and then there's Thanksgiving here next week in the US, so
I'll be gone around then too, so I may be pretty quiet for the next
week or so.

Also, I'm going to try and get pl39 out today.  No promises, but
hopefully...

Andy> PPS: Ceterum censeo:  I absolutely love FVWM.  Great work, FVWM team!

Glad to hear it (Rob did a great job, didn't he?).

Later,
Chuck

Hello,

I switched from fvwm 1.24r to fvwm 2.0.38 and although fvwm 2 adds new
Style options, I still miss one: I would like to have a NeverFocus, a
ClickToFocus is nice but not sufficient. For example I would to like 
to click on the FvwmButtons windows without it recieving focus.

And one other thing: What happend to TogglePage? The FAQ said it is
obsoleted, but I used it alot with fvwm 1 and am using fvwm 1 again
cause I can't live without it....

Todd> Is this the wm or xlock's problem?

I believe that it may be a little of both.  For instance, swirl mode
(xlockmore 3.2) installs it's own colormap, which works, but then when
fvwm comes back, The colormap doesn't get restored correctly.  So, I
would assume that passing in -install for blank mode should work this
way as well, but as you see it doesn't.  I'll look into this (adding
it to TO-DO list).

It is getting better though, since swirl mode never really worked w/
fvwm (1.xx) in the past, I believe.

An interesting idea.  Normally the programs themselves should take
care of this, but this sounds interesting.  I'll add it to the TO-DO
list as an idea, but if it does happen it won't be until after the
great Style flag update...

Enough people have complained about that, so it may reappear...

Hello,

I'm a fan of FVWM, currently using 2.35. Just before sending this
mail, i compiled 2.38 and reran just to see if the problem repeats and
it did.  I'd like to find out whether anyone has had problem of
crashing (I mean crashing the X server, logging you all the way out)
whenever you change the magnification of the view (to zoom in) when
you run Ghostview. I have tried this on Ghostview 1.5 and 1.4.1 and
they did not crash on MWM and did on both FVWM 2.35 and 2.38. Maybe
this is a FVWM problem all along and someone just has not run into it.
I am running on a Sparc20 SunOS 4.1.4 and FVWM was compiled with 
Gcc 2.5.8

regards,

Tuan Hoang

Hi,

I am brandnew to the Fvwm program.  I have it up and running on a SunOS =
4.1.3 system, but I can not for the life of me get it to compile on a =
Solaris 2.4 system.  Is there somewhere that I can download a =
pre-compiled version for Sun SparcStation2 Solaris 2.4.  I also need the =
Xpm software.  I am new to Solaris and can not get anything to compile.  =
I am using the GNU pre-compiled gcc compiler to do the compilation.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Howdy all,

Ok, version 2.0.39 is available at ftp.hpc.uh.edu in
/pub/fvwm/version-2:

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   users     471663 Nov 16 10:55 fvwm-2.0.39.tar.gz

Here's what changed:

2.0.39
       1. More Imake fixes from Randall Winchester
       2. Started adding optional debug messages, to help people help me
          solve problems that I can't reproduce (a define in configure.h
          to enable these, off by default)
       3. Added -blackout option, to black out screen during init and
          recapture (no blackout is default now)
       4. Removed some unused variables, cleaned up some code that
          generated compiler warnings
       5. More small doc & FAQ updates
       6. Fix for using "None" as font in FvwmPager to not have a Label
          (it now works)
       7. Making Resource = "NoResource" instead of "Untitled" (if class
          hints res_name is NULL) to differentiate between window Name &
          window Resource so Style commands for windows that have a
          WM_NAME but no WM_CLASS don't match Untitled
       8. Simple FvwmWinList refresh patch
       9. Added Imakefile for FvwmConfig (only works under X11R6)

Some notes on these:

  #1 - addresses all of the complaints that people had when 2.0.38
  came out, I believe.

  #2 - is for those of you who are experiencing lockups at startup and
  things like that.  Look at the bottom of configure.h and enable the
  debug messages, then run fvwm piping all of the output to a file and
  send it to me with a complete description of what happened and how
  you compiled everything and what os, etc.  Perhaps it will help,
  perhaps not.  No one else enable that, since it will cause things to
  get rather slow and probably overload your .xerrors file, blowing
  your quota rather quickly.

  #4 - I also ran it under Purify.  Found no problems.

  #7 - should fix what Frederic Devernay was attempting to fix without
  interfering with anything.

I'll probably be pretty quiet for the next week or so.  I'm being
moved to another building this weekend, and I'll be out for a lot of
next week.  I'll have to read and respond to your complaints,
suggestions, and/or praise when I get back.  I might get a chance one
day next week to read them, but I can't make any guarantees.

Also, I still have lots of old suggestions, complaints, bug reports,
etc. that I haven't waded through yet, so if I seemed to have missed
something of yours, fear not, I'll get to it eventually...

my guess is that the screen saver users an override-redirect window.
Somewhere along the line, I added code which made fvwm get sloppy about
colormaps when override-redirect windows were present. This was done
for WABI, which is also override-redirect, and sometimes installs its
own colormap. Most likely, fvwm doesn't notice when the override-redirect
window goes away, so it doesn't restore the colormap correctly (or maybe,
the override-redirect window doesn't go away, it just unmaps or something).

As I recall, the ICCCM doesn't say how to handle colormaps for
override-redirect windows, so I couldn't say what the correct behavior is.

I have had some trouble building the latest

FTP site that offers pre-built binaries for Solaris?  Please reply to
me at the address below. [I had to stop subscribing to the fvwm list
since it no longer seems to offer digests - I couldn't handle the
volume.]  Thanks so very much!!!!

I had 2 problems compiling the new fvwm:

1. fvwm/fvwm.c uses a basename library function which I don't think is
very standard.  My fix was to simply remove it (it's only used in a
fprintf):

*** fvwm.c.orig Thu Nov 16 10:20:54 1995
--- fvwm.c      Thu Nov 16 10:21:12 1995
***************

  void usage(void)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"\nFvwm Version %s Usage:\n\n",VERSION);
!   fprintf(stderr,"  %s [-d dpy] [-debug] [-f config_cmd] [-s] [-blackout] [-version] [-h]\n",basename(g_argv[0]));
  }
  
  /****************************************************************************

  }
  
  /****************************************************************************


2. FvwmBanner didn't link because it was missing -lsocket and -lnsl.
This occurred because the FvwmBanner Imakefile defines:

    EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES

and the Makefile created by imake defines:

    EXTRA_LIBRARIES = -lsocket -lnsl

Note that EXTRA_LIBRARIES in Imakefile overrides the definition by
imake.  I don't know what to recommend here as a good solution.  My
quick solution was to define:

    EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES -lsocket -lnsl

Now to see if it works...

I don't understand, this works fine in 38 (I use "none", didn't try "None").

Just checked and yes, that's what's happening here.  Makes sense,
since they don't want it to have any borders or titles applied to the
window that obscures the entire display.

I remember all that.  I really hate WABI...

That seems to be the case.

I just looked real quick at the ICCCM 2.0 and didn't see any
references to override-redirect at all.  I'll take a closer look
later.

Perhaps a global option that means "I'll be using WABI" might be in
order, to account for this, and only do the "sloppyness" if it's set.

I had a report from someone (don't recall who right now) that it

shouldn't have broken it for anyone that it was working for (which I
assume it didn't).

in compiling pl39 on solaris2.4 I get an unknown symbol "basename" in 
fvwm.c

Its in the usage statement.  Apparently something new between 38 and 
39 (I checked).  Not sure where the basename library call is supposed 
to be.  Is that part of the standard C library?

This should be fixed by using ADD_LIB in the Imakefile:

Actually all one needs to do is remove

    EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES

from the Imakefile.

The R6 version of imake likes this syntax:

	EXTRA_LIBRARIES .= XPM_LIBRARIES

which, as you might guess, prepends XPM_LIBRARIES to EXTRA_LIBRARIES.

I couldn't find this behaviour documented, but if it is a standard
thing I would think that would be the way to go.

basename() is not part of ANSI C, but is present in some libc's.
Here is a substitute:


#include <string.h>
char *
basename(char *path)
{
	char	*c = strrchr(path, '/');

	if (c) return(c+1);
	return(path);
}

i just downloaded it also and got the same error.  i commented out the
line and it works.  basename is apparently both a unix command that
returns the last item in a pathname.

Any help with the following two questions would be much appreciated.

I.

I have just buit/installed fvwm2.p39.  I am trying to get the icon placement
behavior I had in fvwm, where the icons would get placed somewhere in the 
upper left corner, but *not* under an existing window.  I think
I set something like StubbornIconPlacement to get that effect.
What can I do now?

II.  My pager in fvwm v1.24 was about half the size it is now (for the same
     of 3 virtual 2x2 desktops.  What controls the geometry of its size?

III.  Oops... a third question.  The man page doesn't say much about
      the modules, and I don't see any other docs on them, other than
      a modules.tex (which doesn't build right with the TeX I have).
      Can someone send me a .ps of this file, or point me to a better
      module document?

Thanks so much, in advance, to all who reply.  I only subscribe to the
fvwm announce mail list, so please email response to the address below.

Reading configure.h for .39 gives me the following:


/* Where do you want the fvwm icons to go. */
#define FVWM_ICONDIR "/usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps"

For me that means that I want the installation program to copy the

Hello !

Here is my wishlist and my 2 cents for fvwm2 ;-)

I upgraded to fvwm2 recently on both my Linux P5/90 40MB at home and a
DEC-Unix Alpha/275 128MB at my office and it compiled out of the box.

First I converted the old .fvwmrc's with the supplied convert-script to
v2 format. I noticed that the script has problems when you have "linked"
GoodStuff modules in the old .fvwmrc files. I had to insert exec-
statements manually in the lines that call swallow-buttons.


Later I discovered that a fvwm1-functionality has gone: You cannot use
both the "Style IconBox" and "FvwmIconBox" anymore. This is because you
have to apply 'Style "*" NoIcon' if you want so see icons in FvwmIconBox.
In fvwm1 I used both icons on the desktop and in the Box !

A good solution to this problem could be to completely move the
functionality of "Style IconBox" to FvwmIconBox. This could be done with
*FvwmIconBox statements that allow one to 
 - control the thickness of the border of FvwmIconBox
 - completely disable the border and scrollbars
 - disable the iconbox-background, so icons can be placed directly on the
   desktop-background
 - an option that allows to control what icons are shown in the Iconbox
   (currently 'Style Iconbox' shows only iconified windows, FvwmIconBox
    shows all started x-apps and modules)


I also noticed that the order of statements is important in fvwm2.
Let's say if you put 'Style "*" NoIcon' before any other 'Style "*" Icon
foo' statement then no icons are displayed in the IconBox.


Other small problems with fvwm are:

Sometimes I have timing problems when using swallow-programs in
FvwmButtons. I had to insert wait-statements in the init- and restart-
functions of the module, because sometimes the programs don't swallow but
appear as normal windows. (Especially if I swallow commands like
'rsh slowhost "xload -display local:0"')

FvwmButtons is slow on my Pentium even with a PCI/VRAM graphics adapter.
I use to display many colored icons in the module. The initilization is
slow, and also when moving windows over the buttons-module the repaint is
very slow.



Overall I like fvwm very much, imho the best window-manager today !

l8r,
	Stefan.

Hi Fvwm'ers,

I've written a freeware Tcl/Tk button bar thing which I presumptuously
call "tkgoodstuff".  It is like FvwmButtons in being a button panel,
but is written in an interpreted language, so it's easy to modify, and
it comes with "clients": analog/digital alarm clock, dialup net
connection dialer/monitor, biff, www launcher, xload, menu button,
etc., etc..  The benefit is supposed to be that it's configureable and
just one process.  It can't "swallow" (yet!), but given it's built-in
clients that's not so often a problem.  This is not an advertisement,
though.  In fact, I feel a little sheepish posting to the fvwm list,
since tkgoodstuff is sort of a competitor to FvwmButtons (which is
great!).

Here's the point: I have used the "tkfvwm" extension to tk (by Andreas
Aravena) to make a fvwm "client" for tkgoodstuff, which turns
tkgoodstuff into an fvwm module (didn't Mr. Nation hisself suggest
somewhere that Tcl/Tk modules would make sense?).  It allows the
buttons you create to talk to fvwm (so you can focus on an emacs
window or create one if necessary).  Also, it implements a sort of
win95-like icon window (also a bit like FvwmIconBox).  Anyway, I'm
posting here because I thought y'all'd be the best possible beta
testers for this thing.  I'd very much appreciate any advice about
functionality, bugs, etc.

Relevant stuff:
 docs and screenshots:
   http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff

 packages:
   ftp://merv.philosophy.lsa.umich.edu/pub/in-progress
     tkgoodstuff4.1b3.tgz
     tkfvwm0.5+.tgz (for fvwm2)
     ../tkxpm4.1.tgz (for xpm functionality)

 requires Tcl7.5/Tk4.1 (ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl)

Thanks for any feedback,
Mark

I tried it on SunOS4 and it didn't work.

Lines of this nature aren't interpreted by imake, they just get copied
to the Makefile, so I suspect this is a feature of `make' on your
system, not R6's imake.

hi Folks,

finally got the  mogrify tool to create a single colormap fo all
icons. I put it to 100 Colors, so it should also be good for 8 Bit
displays. If someone wants to have less colors, tell me. I'll try to
figure out something to make it work ;)

else, here are the Enhancements, new to the Old README:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is Version 0.11 of 3d_pixmaps

Enhancements of 0.11:  
  - A little Cleanup, in fact, some non 3d pixmaps where remaining
    and I took them out.
  - Also, finally crated am own colormap for all pixmaps. They are using
    100 Colors all together, so it should be O.K.
    (If someone needs a smaller colormap, please contact me).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get it from:

ftp://pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de/pub/3dpixmaps/3d_pixmaps_0.11.tar.gz


Enjoy ;)

PS.: If someone knows of an Emplacement for nice Icons, please send me
the location ;) Thx ...

Hi Ric,

I can't help you with this.  But I know that someone else didn't
like this behavior and wrote an extension.  Chuck is currently
reviewing it and might decide to put it into a later release of fvwm.

> II.  My pager in fvwm v1.24 was about half the size it is now (for the same

The builtin pager of v1.24 is gone.  You have to use FvwmPager instead.
If you only want to see the contents of the current desktop, iconify
the FvwmPager.v1.24 or put this in your .fvwm2rc:
*FvwmPagerStartIconic

Then you can control the size of the icon by doing this:
*FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35

Unfortunately it doesn't work to specify the position of the icon
like this:
*FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1
If you happen to find a way to do that be sure to let me know, please.

There is a man page for every module.  You can find it in the specific
directory.  If you did a "make install.man" a 'man FvwmPager' should
do it.

I'll send a copy to the list anyway, if you don't mind.

This is an excerpt from my .fvwmrc, and it allows me to iconise FvwmButtons and
FvwmIconBox, and I'm sure I could specify other Icons!

Well known, and documented!!

Of course, that how Styles work! (they're OR'd together)

'Twas curing a PCI 133 MHz Pentium with 24-bit color the other day of its
Windows 95 infestation by installing a useful operating system, Linxu
1.2.13, on it.  Since I'd had no problems whatsoever with fvwm 1.x or 2.x
over the past couple of years on any of the platforms I'd used it on --
SunOS, Solaris, HP, AIX, or Linux -- I quickly installed fvwm 2.0.38,
which just screams on this system.  After we beat NIS and token ring into
submission on it, I went through the task of configuring my .fvwmrc file
to support not only HP (my primary workstation at work), but also Linux,
Solaris, and AIX.  I figured that this would be the perfect application
for FvwmM4, so I read up on them and went to work, modifying my .fvwmrc
and .xinitrc files appropriately.  The only change I'd made to my .fvwmrc
file was to wrap the ModulePath with a test for the operating system type;
everything else in my .fvwmrc file was valid on all the other architectures
we use at work.  The only change I put into my .xinitrc file was to tell
fvwm to run FvwmM4 at startup.

What I noticed was this:  When starting fvwm, telling it to preprocess the
.fvwmrc with FvwmM4, the cosmetic configuration (borders, colors, etc.) was
completely wrong (default values, methinks), but when I ran the .fvwmrc
file generated by FvwmM4 through fvwm (i.e. fvwm -f "Read /tmp/fvwmrc..."
or something like that), everything came up fine.  Pathnames to modules,
colors, borders, everything.

This also happened with FvwmCpp.

I got around the problem with a less optimal approach, but it worked:  one
.fvwmrc file for each architecture.  (To quote Tim Bray from OpenText
Corporation: "Disk space is free [after you factor in the costs of living
with disk space shortage.]")  I really would like to get the FvwmM4 or
FvwmCpp approach working, though, because it is the more optimal answer to
this multi-architectural situation; unfortunately, I don't have the time to
give in to temptation and walk fvwm through the debugger to see what it's
doing.  If anyone has any pointers on using FvwmM4 or FvwmCpp -- things to
watch for, do's-and-dont's, etc. -- I would really appreciate it!

IRIX 5.3 needs -lgen, too. I don't know where in Imakefile or
configure.h to do this, though, I just ran the load manually.

Hello,

Quoting Christopher A. Smith,

| What I noticed was this:  When starting fvwm, telling it to preprocess the
| .fvwmrc with FvwmM4, the cosmetic configuration (borders, colors, etc.) was
| completely wrong (default values, methinks), but when I ran the .fvwmrc
| file generated by FvwmM4 through fvwm (i.e. fvwm -f "Read /tmp/fvwmrc..."
| or something like that), everything came up fine.  Pathnames to modules,
| colors, borders, everything.
| 
| This also happened with FvwmCpp.

Well I have such a setup for my Solaris/SunOs boxes.  
It works just fine, except for the string of command line options needed in
my Solaris startup because the cpp is in a non-standard place and the makefile
didn't figure it out/isn't setup to figure it out?.

Here is the .fvwmrc clip:

#ifdef SOLARIS
ModulePath /home/jon/Fvwm/solaris/
#else
ModulePath /home/jon/Fvwm/sunos/
#endif

and here is a bit from my .xinitrc:

if [ x$sysv = xYES ]
then
 # SOLARIS
 Fvwm/solaris/fvwm -f "/home/jon/Fvwm/solaris/FvwmCpp -Cppprog /usr/ccs/lib/cpp
 -Cppopt -DSOLARIS /home/jon/.fvwm2rc"
else
 # SUNOS
 Fvwm/sunos/fvwm -f "/home/jon/Fvwm/sunos/FvwmCpp /home/jon/.fvwm2rc"
fi

i have not been able to get swallow to work at all (except swallow-module
which is fine).  i had given up after trying the system.fwmrc and examples
from the someones web page.  they just are not working, the xclocks or
whatever just show up on the desktop.  

how can a wait help this?  any suggestions would be great...


thanks

I miss SloppyFocus--it lets me move the pointer out of the way without
losing focus. Is it coming back?

Maybe it needs a sexier name like LazyFocus...

Just switched from 1.24 to 2.0.39 on my Indy. Most things have gone
pretty smoothly, but I can't seem to configure my pager like it was
before.

If I leave out DeskTopSize but set *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale to 32, I get
3x3 desktops at 1/32 scale. If I set DeskTopSize to 2x2, I get 2x2
desktops, but not at 1/32 scale...whatever the default is, it's
larger.

Why does DeskTopSize affect *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale?

OK, sorry about the SloppyFocus FAQ--didn't see the FAQ file in the
distribution.

I see that TogglePage is mentioned in TO-DO, and I'd just like to say
that this feature is very important to me, and I hope it comes back
soon. I'll have to crank up EdgeResistance to emulate a TogglePage
off.

it never left. :)  you just have to specify it differently - in a style
line, instead of by itself.  here's the line from my .fvwm2rc for it:

Style "*"           BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 2, SloppyFocus

that's the one of the first style lines in my .fvwm2rc, so everything
that isn't defined specifically later, recieves those styles...

Get unclutter it is better. It can be found from
ftp://ftp.cs.umn.edu/packages/X11/contrib/utilties/unclutter-8.tar.gz

I will make your pointer go away completly after a default 5 seconds of

I had a similar problem which turned out to be bad syntax in the Exec
expression. This works for me:

*FvwmButtons - whatever  Swallow "oclock" Exec oclock
*FvwmButtons - whatever  Swallow "xbiff" Exec xbiff -geometry -0-0
*FvwmButtons TermWindow xterm.xpm Exec "" xterm -title "$HOSTNAME" -n "$HOSTNAME"

I've seen something similar when restarting fvwm -- perhaps that bug
is related to this one.

Anyway, in my .fvwmrc I have lines like

	# Font selection -- can be conditionalized via CPP or M4.
	#FvwmM4 -m4-prefix ".fvwm/fonts-m4"
	#Read ".fvwm/fonts"
	FvwmCpp ".fvwm/fonts-cpp"

and that works fine (fonts-cpp is appended below). Maybe you can
strucuture your .fvwmrc to work around this bug. Personally, I like
having a .fvwm directory, with files categorized by function within
it, but I know some don't care for it.

Thanks for pointing that out. Yes, I was being sloppy, and GNU make
was doing what I wanted. Probably the more portable solution is to use
the `+=' syntax, which is recognized by all the makes I have access
to: GNU make, Solaris-2.3 make, SUNOS4 make.

Or use something like this:

AddToMenu Utilities	"Utilities"	Title 	
+			"Paging ..."	Popup Paging-Style

AddToMenu Paging-Style 	"Paging Options" Title	
+			"OFF"	EdgeScroll 0 0
+			"ON"	EdgeScroll 100 100
+			"Horizontal Only"	EdgeScroll 100 0
+			"Vertical Only"		EdgeScroll 0 100
+			"Partial"		EdgeScroll 50 50

Granted it's not button-able, (there is more mouse motion involved)
but then again it does more than a toggle.

Perhaps this alternative can be mentioned in the FAQ (I've answered a
few times in the past, so if F = 3 or more it would qualify :-).

Also, someone (Makoto 'MAR_kun' MATSUSHITA?) submitted a patch
not too long ago to re-anable it into fvwm2. Maybe you can find it in
the list archives.

No need to crank up EdgeResistance, just use:

+ "Edge Scrolling On" EdgeScroll 100 100
+ "Edge Scrolling Off" EdgeScroll 0 0

in a menu to turn it on and off.  If this isn't in the FAQ, it should
be.

I don't think `+=' is portable.  A lot of makes out there are
brain-dead.  Sun's make has lots of nice features (like GNU make) that
other makes don't support.

In fvwm 1.24, the icons of sticky windows were easily visible because they
were a different color.  In 2.0.39, this is no longer the case, at least,
when using the supplied .fvwm2rc file.  Also, when I de-iconify them,
they come back under existing windows, instead of on top?  Can anyone
explain how to modify these behaviors?  Thanks in advance.

I really thought I fixed all these, Sorry,
Randall

The correct solution for Mark's scond problem is to remove the line;
EXTRA_LIBRARIES = XPM_LIBRARIES
from fvwm/modules/FvwmBanner/Imakefile.
Also there is another occurance of this in fvwm/modules/FvwmConfig/Imakefile.
The XPM_LIBRARIES flag is taken care of elsewere now.

Hi Folks,

- OK Folks. I guess here I am again, this time (I hope) with the final
  Version of 3d Icons. The big Jump came, because I found a great way
  in Creating a huge number of new icons.

Enhancements 0f 1.0:

  - A complete bunch of new Icons. In fact, I converted some old 2d
pixmaps
    and integrated them on the Template-pixmap. So, you got about 3,5
Megs
    of Icons. Of course, all with their respective mini-icon ;)
  - For 8 bit Display Users:
    I made 2 Packages availiable. Package 1 -> 3dpixmaps_100colors has
    all icons reduced to use only 100 Colors in all. They also look
    good, even if some Icons losst a little bit of their shapeness :(
  - For >= 16 bit Display Users:
    Unfortunatly, the color-reduction leaved some Icons in a way I
    didn't like (Modified clearness a bit), so I decided to make a 2nd
    Version availiable. This one uses all original colors with no
    colormap-reduction. Have a look at Package 2 -> 3dpixmaps !
  - Note: Using the 100 Colors reduced Icons speeds up X-Starting
    considerably. 

So Enjoy the Icons, and if someone wants some own integrated, send me
a mail ;)

as usual, you can get a copy on:

ftp://pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de/pub/3dpixmaps/3d_pixmaps_1.0.tar.gz

This file is quite bigger than previous releases (around 1.14
Megs). It has both, 100Colors and plain packages in it.

If you like it, send me a little mail, and if enough people like it,
I'll post it somwhere to sunsite :) but I'll first have to make an
lsm_Entry for it ;)

Just thought I put in my oar about 2.0.39. I had virtually _no_ problems with
building it (apart from the know basename and FvwmBanner Imake bugs :-) )

I am very pleased with the new version.
Good work Chuck, et. al.

Tara,
Ben.

p.s. I did have one problem, though, when I did make install, after a few
directories, my entire X session bombed out! I wonder why ;-) (I was using
fvwm at the time)

In fact this is the _only_ situation in the entire 2 years (approx) I've been
using Fvwm that it has crashed! - but then I think it's an operating system
bug - I mean, an operating system should be able to allow you to change the
binary of a programme you're running without crashing the current version?
Shouldn't it? ;-) ;-) ;-)

Could you separate out the two packages. We only have 1-bit and 8-bit
displays on our site, and when I tried to get 3d_pixmaps.0.1 your server
was so slow I gave up waiting. I dread to think how long 1.1M would take
to download!

Have you tried the Style StaysOnTop?

in fvwm 2.0.39:
I think basename() is a non-standard function, I didn't find it on SunOS 4
and using it on SGI requires using an additional library (-lgen). Since
this is only used in fvwm.c for usage printing, maybe it could just be
removed from there, or a basename() function could be added to libfvwm.a...

Well I have been a faithful user for years now, and followed the fvwm
mailinglist with great interest. There I have seen mails with subjects
about fvw, and Wabi, and ignored these (well I have read one or two
but I don't remember the contents) because I though 'That will never
happen to *me*', well that time has come now.. 

As you can guess I have some minor problems with wabi, my pager died,
my wabi-windows getting sticky and in front. Did you find any
solutions? 

I haven't found any mail-archive for fvw, maybe it is time to do a FAQ
for fvwm??

You can't do jack about it.  On the few occasions I use it (mainly to avoid
going over to a PC just to run MS Word), I just iconify all my WABI apps when
I'm not using them.

Bummer, huh ?

Hope This Helps (though I know it won't :),

Yes, I tried compiling it on SunOS5 and couldn't find it either.

I'm not sure what it is supposed to do; is there a substitute?

it removes the leading directory names from a filename, keeping just
the file name itself.

a substitute could easily be written, but the simplest is to simply
remove it from fvwm.c, the function usage() becoming:

void usage(void)
{
  fprintf(stderr,"\nFvwm Version %s Usage:\n\n",VERSION);
  fprintf(stderr,"  %s [-d dpy] [-debug] [-f config_cmd] [-s] [-blackout] [-version] [-h]\n",g_argv[0]);
}

Do the pixmaps in the recent release pixmaps on this list have to have grey
backgrounds? In displaying these pixmaps, surely I am wasting at least 2
colours on the background alone. Would it be possible to have the 3d pixmaps
(in fact all pixmaps)in transparent form and then use an xpm option to do the
work of adding a background template xpm. If not would this be a useful add-on
to the xpm library?
Secondly would there be any benefits to fvwm being written in C++ and if so
would anyone do it. I would be happy to do such a thing, but I am totally
inexperienced in visual programming and would need such help that I could not
do it on my own. I would be very willing however to try to write a few classes
for a fvwm++.

I've run into a problem linking fvwm 2.0.39 on a Linux box (kernal
1.2.8, gcc 2.6.3, 486DX50, 8MB).  All compiles file, but ld fails with
an IOT Trap.  If I compile with -static, all works fine, but memory
consumption is, of course, horrible.  I would initially suspect an OS
problem, but I've not seen this behavior with any other X program.

Any ideas?

1.24r worked just fine, and 2.0.39 works well with -static, except for
the memory consumption.

Here's a simple basename function.  It doesn't do all that the
basename function is documented to do, but it will handle extraction
of a program name from a fully qualified path name:

/* basename.c

   Given a pointer, s, to a null-terminated character string that
   contains a path name, basename returns a pointer to the last
   element in the path.

   Unlike the real basename, trailing ``/'' characters are not
   deleted, nor is a pointer to a static constant ``.'' returned if s
   or *s is NULL.  This should not be a problem if one desires only
   the program name from the fully qualified executable path name.

*/

#include <string.h>

char *basename ( char *s )
{
  char *t;
  t = strrchr ( s, '/' );
  return ( ( t ) ? ( t + 1 ) : s );
}

SGI X servers don't provide the save-unders server option, thus
whenever a Fvwm menu is drawn, the contents of the display under it is
lost and must be redrawn. It can take a lot of time, e.g. if it's a
large 3-D scene.

SGI servers provide an alternative to it called Overlays, which
consists of a completely different visual with a small screen depth
(usually 2 bits), which is drawn over everything else, and it would be
great if fvwm could use this feature whenever it's available. The only
problem is that since Overlay planes have a small colormap (3 colors +
transparent color), we will have to reduce the color usage for menus
(black + white + menubackground) and use pixmap for shaded borders
instead. GLUT (http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL/glut.html) uses
Overlays for its menus whenever it's available.

Is anybody else interested in this extension of fvwm?

Hi Charles,

minor note: the package still unzips into ./fvwm/... I thought that was
going to be changed to ./fvwm-2.0.XX/...

Thanks,

I'm still getting errors like these (presumably because of swallowed apps

be fixed?

   X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
     Major opcode of failed request:  25 (X_SendEvent)
     Resource id in failed request:  0x3000003
     Serial number of failed request:  514
     Current serial number in output stream:  515
   X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
     Major opcode of failed request:  2 (X_ChangeWindowAttributes)
     Resource id in failed request:  0x6000009
     Serial number of failed request:  62
     Current serial number in output stream:  64

Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks,

Yes.

I am responsible for providing X servers on the graphics hardware that
my company manufactures. I have been considering doing something like
this on hardware which has overlay planes, but for some reason they are
unused.

I don't know how SGI implement it, but the most likely would be that
the overlay planes are represented by different visual. Thus any windows
created with this particular visual appear in the overlay planes. At
least, that is how I imagined doing it. I don't think that would be too
difficult to incorporate, we just need an config option to specify an
alternative visual for popup menus.

I think some sun framebuffers might have other planes available too.

I don't know if it should be an optional behavior, a configurable option,
or the semantics of the implementation, I just know it would be very
useful if someone would allow a menu that currently looks like this:

	    (and forever into oblivion)
	    ........
           |_________|
           |_________|

to look like this:

|__________|_________|_________|
|__________|_________|_________|
|__________|_________|_________|
|__________|_________|_________|
           |_________|_________|

(you get the idea)

or maybe even 3 rows, depending on 'what is appropriate'.  I don't have a
clue to suggest what is appropriate, it is just that the xlock menu of
possible modes is getting a bit too long :-)  and so I thought maybe this
could be a 'To-Do' useful feature to be added SOMEHOW.

I leave it up to you guys to decide 'how' and 'what is good'.

Have fun!

Is it at all possible to compile FVWM 1.24r with GCC under Solaris 2.4?
I just get messages that include-files and libraries are missing. Can I 
get the Xpm-libraries somewhere that makes it possible to compile or does 
anyone else have a tip?

Hi all,

I can see that when specifying a percentage of vertical screen space, the 
maximize function begins from the top of the screen by default, and expands 
the specified percentage of the vertical screen downward.

To me it seems most ergonomic to have my toolbar at the top of the screen 
since all of FVWM's window buttons are there as well as all applications 
menu's.  With the toolbar at the top of the screen I'm no longer constantly 
running my mouse from the bottom (when starting an ap) to the top (when using 
an ap).

I'm using tkgoodstuff at the top of my screen, and I'd like my maximized 
windows to cover 90% of the screen's vertical length, but starting from the 
bottom; leaving room at the to so that TkGoodstuff is never covered up.

Is there anyway to achieve this?

If I am not completely wrong, I believe you can do a combination
function which resizes the window to 90% and moves it down to the correct 
line. I have not done it myself though.

I have a small whish myself:
I have the goodstuff buttonbar to the right and it is sticky and ontop.
I would like the left edge of the bar to behave like the screen border. 
That is, it should block windows crossing it for a short time of mouse 
movement. So it would be just as easy to align windows to the button bar
as to the screen border since the button bar more or less is the new 
screen border.

Ok, I'll leave the package at http://www.umich.edu/~jgotts/
3d_pixmaps_1.0.tar.gz for a few more days, then wax it.

Heyyo,

I have been following the mail list for a little while, but I haven't
seen any reference to this, so here's my request...

In tvtwm (and maybe twm, not sure), you can specify "weight" directions
for the icon box.  An example is to have an icon box on the bottom of
the screen and weight it so that it fills from the bottom left corner
out to the right, and then up.  Of course, primary and secondary
directions are specified in the .blahrc file.

If this is already a feature of fvwm, please let me know for I missed
it in the manpage and example .fvwmrc's.  If not, what are the chances
of having it incorporated?

Thanks.

I just joined this mailing list and was wondering if any work has been
done - or ongoing discussions about - adding a capability to scripts
like shell scripts #! to designate what kind of module should get a
particular script?  I have looked at it a bit and it appears non-trivial
but possible.  Is there a desire for such a capability?

Todd Fries suggested menus with several columns.  "Me too".
A dynamic version -- where Fvwm decides where to start the next column
-- would be nice, but a static one -- a new entry "Newcolumn" -- is
quite enough for me.

Oh yes, it's not just for Xlock, either. :-)

Hi:
	Is there a way to have fvwm do something as it is exiting in a 
similar way as startup and restart?

	Also, where would I find 'gtbl' and 'groff' so I can use man.

I would like to join this mailing list.

----------------------------------------------------
Q:  Is anyone working on a configurator using an FvwmWish, like the one 
presented in 'The X Resource' issue fourteen?

	I've seen 'dotfile' but could not get it to function.  I was able
to use the interface, but it refused to generate the configuration file. 
I like the nested input thingys with the scissors and scrollbars.  It
seems to me that the easiest and fastest way to get a module up and
running would be to develop in Tcl/Tk/BLT/Expect/[incr Tcl]/TclX, 
extended as an FvwmModule, from reading the article.
	I'm new...  I'm not a programmer, YET.  I just got Brent B. 
Welch's book 'Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk', and issue fourteen of
'The X Resource'.  (I haven't read it yet.) I was intrigued by the idea of
being able to extend the window manager with easy to write scripts.  Have
you ever seen WinMacro and WinBatch for Windows, by Wilson WindowWare? 
(it's ShareWare- they also do WinEdit, which is THE BEST) I think Tcl/Tk
is MUCH better. 

	I am going to write a config module for Fantastic Virtual Window
Manager. 
	I think it should be sort of like the one of the Windose 
task-managers I've seen, with a launch button, tile and cascade, and 
'control-panel'.  It should be very modular to reduce the time it takes 
to load.  It would put each section of the rc file into a separate file 
maybe, in a ~/rc.fvwm subdirectory, and then link them all together at 
startup using FvwmM4 or FvwmCPP...  Perhaps an option for a global 
configuration...  A way to extend the menus on the fly, using 
drag-and-drop from a file-manager.

Q: (semi rhetorical): Would it be easier to use separate files or to put 
it all together into one big one?
A: I think the scripts will be split into module files to speed loading.  
The .fvwmrc file will get comments added to it, and be sectioned so that 
the configurator will be able to find out where to make changes, like a 
Windows .ini file.  And the module *ModuleameOption lines should go at 
the front of the file so it doesn't have to scan as far each time...  
Unless modules can have their own .rc files.  Please comment.

	Any input?  What other kinds of modules have people written?  On 
the release notes section of Netscape 2.0b3 they talk about a feature of 
the Win95 version of it where you can have an Internet shortcut icon on 
your desktop.  You drab a URL out of Netxcape and drop it on the desk.  I 
think that Fvwm could do something like that...  Please?
	Hmmm....  It would send out a message to a listening module
telling it about a drop action onto the desktop?  (or onto a module.)
I'm not a programmer, yet.

	First things first.  How do I compile a Tcl/Tk... or anything to
utilize shared DLL's ???  (what is a... uhmm, you know, uh, a... uhhmm...)
Beginner.

olvwm has something like this where you can specify a number of columns
in the menu definition.

Another nice feature of olvwm is that ability to specify a directory as
a menu item. It then creates a whole sub-menu consisting of every
executable in the directory.

These might look like:

AddToMenu MainMenu
+       ""                              Columns 2
+       "Main Menu"                     Title
+       "Programs%mini.xlogo.xpm%"      Popup Programs
+       "MyProgs"                       Dirmenu $HOME/bin

You can get the Xpm package from ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries I
believe.  Then you shouldn't have any problems linking FVWM.

Howdy all.

Just thought you'd all like to know I'm back from my vacation (and
none to happy about that, I might add) and will be looking through the
FVWM related mail I received as I'm able to.  Looks like the usual
"this is still screwed up" and "Imake build process still not working
on my system" type messages overall.

I'll get through them all eventually...

Sounds like a potentially good idea.  I've added it to the ever
growing TO-DO list, although I don't know how difficult it'd be to
implement.

Yes!  Seconded!  It would be very nice to be able to have a button bar
(like, oh, say, tkgoodstuff ;^>) treated as something like a screen
"frame".  I don't know exactly the behavior that would be ideal.
Perhaps one could define a rectangular region of the screen as the
"available" region (by default the whole thing), and do what
F. Vhrstrwm suggests with its borders, and try to avoid window
placement there?  Or have a window attribute that gives a window
special bullying power.

Is it conceivable to actually treat an "available" region in nearly
all respects as the actual screen is treated now?  That is to say, a
button/task bar or the like could occupy a portion of the screen
that's not "on" the desktop itself.  There might be a special form of
geometry request (from a module) to request placement in (or
overlapping) the unavailable region.  This region should be
changeable, so that the whole screen can be made available (e.g., by a
button-bar's "hide" function).

One more item for the ever-expanding TODO list:

  The pager isn't correctly updated while dragging a window from
  desktop to desktop.  It can be difficult to tell where you are.  I
  suspect that this isn't an easy thing to do, now that the pager is a
  module.

First, I just discovered Xpmroot appears to have been broken somewhere
along the way. It wasn't broken just in the latest version, which I
installed this weekend, but this latest version is the first that has
installed xpmroot in my X11/bin directory, so it overwrote my old
working copy. I have a xpm file I generated from a gif that I use as a
bcakgroup. I used the ppm utilities to convert it. It's 70K and the
header is show below.

#define noname_format 1
#define noname_width  264
#define noname_height 264
#define noname_ncolors 2
#define noname_chars_per_pixel 1
static char *noname_colors[] = {
   "`", "#000000",
   "a", "#64678b"
}

With the xpmroot program in Fvwm, this won't load. It wouldn't load with
the xpmroot from the previous version I used or with the version from
1.2r that I have archived. But it does load with the xpmroot I
originally had, which must be from the xpm utilities package that had
the xpm editor in it.

Hello Everyone,

I was wondering if anyone has or knows where to get more of the
background pixmaps that can be used with xpm.  One of these is
mentioned in the man page for FvwmBacker, 

*FvwmBackerDesk 3 xpmroot /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/background2.xpm

I found one called background8.xpm, but I cannot find any others.

Also, is it possible to include a command such as the one above
in a menu so that the user can select a background pattern for the 
current desk, thus sending a command directly to the FvwmBacker
module, such as

*FvwmBackerDesk CurrentDesk xpmroot /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/background2.xpm


Has anyone implemented a background menu with perhaps submenus for
backgrounds of solid color, gif images, and background patterns?  
If so, could it be mailed to the list?





Thanks,

Chad

Oops, forgot the question in the last mail.

I'm trying to bring up a menu when I click button 3 on an icon,m but am
having no luck. I've tried the following, where WinOps2 is a popup that
works fine when called from a button on the title bar of my windows.

Mouse 3         I       A       Popup "WinOps2"

But when this is assigned to an icon it won't work.

I also tried calling a finction that defines various actions for click,
movement and double click, but that didn't work either. Is the icon a
special case or just broken?

Well, I've *nearly* got my .fvwm2rc doing all that my .fvwmrc did and
more. 

The only thing it doesn't do is to do with placement.

In the old fvwm, I used a combination of SloppyPlacement,
SmartPlacement and RandomPlacement, which meant that windows would
tend not to materialise over other windows or icons.

The FAQ says that SloppyPlacement has been "obsoleted".
I'd like to know by what it has been made obsolete, because the
SmartPlacement/RandomPlacement combo allows windows to materialise over
icons. 

I've been thru the mailing list archives and can see that this has
been a topic of some discussion. I'd like to know if this *important*
feature has been put back into fvwm?


One other thing -- the FAQ has the *address* of this mailing list, but
I didn't notice how to actually subscribe...?

Oops -- nearly forgot. Another thing is how to launch a module from
FvwmButtons. I have the following;

*FvwmButtons - question.xpm Module "Identify" FvwmIdent

Now, FvwmIdent works from menus, so I am running the right module, but
the above FvwmButtons line *doesn't work*.

Am I missing something obvious? (BTW -- this did work in the old fvwm.)

I have found that I can generally get away with not porting applications
to Solaris by using Sun's SunOS4-compatibility lib.  I modify the
Makefile and put "-L/usr/ucblib -lucb" in my cc line.

Not sure where this is documented.

Has anyone else seen any problems in clients calling XGrabButton or XGrabPointer
under fvwm?  Whenever any client managed by fvwm calls eg. XGrabButton() it
reliably fails with a BadAccess XError (for me at least).  Notably proctool
(solaris) and recent beta versions of netscape seem to do this, as well as my
own code making similar calls.

I'm running the 3.4 sun openwindows dps server with fvwm 2.0.39, but I get this
behavior regardless of which server I run (behaves same with X11R6/fvwm) --
it seems to only happen when I use recent fvwm 2.x versions, not with any
other window managers (olwm, twm, mwm). If nobody else has seen this I'll try
to track down what may be causing it in the code, but it'd be nice to get any
insights anyone may have first...

Hi,

We have been working with fvwm 1.24r until now.  Today I got hold of fvwm2.039.
It built without problems, but I have a bizarre behaviour when trying to move
a window - instead of following the mouse the window will jump down the screen
and will only move left or right (even when moving the mouse up/down 
left/right).  Releasing the mouse button - the window will jump again...the
usual result is that the window goes offscreen somewhere. This happens with
move from the window-ops menu or just by clicking on the title bar. 
 Second - maybe related - problem is the pager.  Here clicking on the desired 
desktop does not work - focus jumps to another....

 I have tried with both the sample.fvwmrc that came with the distribution and
my own converted .fvwmrc - the results are the same.

The system is DEC alpha OSF1/3.2a , compiler was "cc -migrate" but I have tried
also with "cc" both with and without the optimiser - same results.

Anyone have any ideas??

Thanks,

     Ian Bird.

Under AIX I've used the latest beta netscape and not seen this problem

As I said, I don't see this, but I can take a guess at what's
happening here.  Here is an excerpt from the XGrabButton man page:

     If some other client has already issued the XGrabButton function
     with the same button/key combination on the same window, a
     BadAccess error results.

So, my guess is that you have a 'Mouse' line in your .fvwm2rc that is
conflicting with what these programs would like to do, perhaps like
so:

Mouse 1 W N Raise

I'm not 100% certain if this is really your problem, but you could use
it as a starting point for you investigation.

Well, I've *nearly* got my .fvwm2rc doing all that my .fvwmrc did and
more. 

The only thing it doesn't do is to do with placement.

In the old fvwm, I used a combination of SloppyPlacement,
SmartPlacement and RandomPlacement, which meant that windows would
tend not to materialise over other windows or icons.

The FAQ says that SloppyPlacement has been "obsoleted".
I'd like to know by what it has been made obsolete, because the
SmartPlacement/RandomPlacement combo allows windows to materialise over
icons. 

I've been thru the mailing list archives and can see that this has
been a topic of some discussion. I'd like to know if this *important*
feature has been put back into fvwm?


One other thing -- the FAQ has the *address* of this mailing list, but
I didn't notice how to actually subscribe...?

There is no such thing as SloppyPlacement in any version of fvwm that
I'm aware of (1.xx or 2.xx).  There is a SloppyFocus in both though,
but this isn't what you are describing.  I have to assume you mean
StubbornPlacement:

          StubbornPlacement
               When using SmartPlacement, causes new windows to avoid
               placing themselves over icons.

Well, it has been removed.  Why, I'm not certain, but it's not a lot
of code to reactivate it so I've added it to the TO-DO list.
Unfortunately it'll have to wait until I rewrite the Style related
code to handle more styles (which may be why it dissappeared).

(I know many of you are thinking "he keeps saying that, but when's it
gonna happen?"  I'll get to it eventually, but it's going to be a big
project and I don't have the time to do it just yet, plus I still need
to get the first "official" release out the door.  I do have some
[hopefully] good ideas about how to implement it though.)

How'd I miss that?  Well, it's in there now.

I use a popup menu on the button bar to take my ppp link up/down.
In order to popup the menu, I have to click and release mouse button 1
on the appropriate button.

What I really want is to have the menu popup on a "button down" event,
not "button up", just like the root menus.  Is there any way to do this?

Here are the appropriate sections from .fvwm2rc (2.0.39)

AddToMenu "PPP" "PPP" Title
+              "PPP-up" Exec exec /usr/local/bin/pppup > /dev/console 2>&1 &
+              "PPP-down" Exec exec /usr/local/bin/pppdown > /dev/console 2>&1 &

*FvwmButtons	PPP	calvin2-trans.xpm	Menu "PPP"

If this is an rtfm, let me know and I'll read it more closely.

While I don't know about the exact behavior you wish, how about making the
button clickable on the button bar and run a script like this:

*FvwmButtons ....... Exec exec /usr/local/bin/pppup-or-down &

--------/usr/local/bin/pppup-or-down-------------
#!/bin/bash

if [ "`/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 2> /dev/null`" ];
   /usr/local/bin/pppdown 2>&1 > /dev/console
else
  /usr/local/bin/pppup 2>&1 > /dev/console
fi
-------------------------------------------------

Maybe this will come in useful..

It is, more or less.  Try using 'Popup "PPP"' instead of 'Menu "PPP"'

Umm... I just took a mistake. Sorry.

I think your *FvwmButtons lines should rewrite from 'Popup' to 'Menu',
i.e., invoke menu by 'Menu' built-in function instead of 'Popup'.

Both 'Popup "PPP"' and 'Menu "PPP"' act identically.  Both wait for the
button up event.  I tried the following configuration, with nothing
else defined on the button bar.  There was no difference in their
behavior.  Must have to do with the Exec?

*FvwmButtons	PPP	calvin2-trans.xpm	Menu "PPP"
*FvwmButtons	PPP	hobbes-trans.xpm	Popup "PPP"

Ah, silly me.  I just tried this and I see the behavior that you were
referring to...  I wasn't truly thinking when I responded earlier.
The code in FvwmButtons only executes the action specified on a button
release, with no way for the user to change that currently.

A check might be able to be put in the code though, if the action is
"popup" to react on the press instead...let me try that...  Nope that
doesn't work either.  It's popping up the menu via a SendInfo to fvwm,
which doesn't process that until the ButtonRelease (for some reason
that I don't know yet, probably due to the way that the module pipes
are polled).  I have to look over that code some more...

If I can figure out how to do it all correctly, the next patchlevel
will have FvwmButtons react to Popup on the ButtonPress.  If it can't
be done, or is too difficult to be worth it, then I'll post that.

Later,
Chuck

A stab in the dark, maybe try something like:


AddToFunc "PPP"
+ "I" Menu "PPP"

*FvwmButtons PPP calvin2-trans.xpm Function "PPP"

or will this do the same thing?

Hello,

Is anyone having trouble with FvwmForm?  It does not seem to work for
me.  I tried the QuitVerify example given in the FvwmForm man page
and nothing happens.  I tried executing it with 'Module FvwmForm QuitVerify'
and then also with 'ln -s FvwmForm QuitVerify' and 'Module QuitVerify'.  
Neither method worked, though.

Any suggestions or help?



Thanks,

Chad

>>>>> Chad Coulliette asks why FvmwForm doesn't work for him...

Do you also use FvwmM4?  If so, run FvwmM4 with the -debug option.
The problem is that FvwmForm hasn't been updated to do use some of the
newer features for module communications in pre2.0.  It still relies
on looking for its configuration in the file specified on its command
line.  If you use FvwmM4, that file will be a temp file, but unless
FvwmM4 is run with the -debug switch, it removes the file so FvwmForm
can't get its config.

Hi,

I'm trying to reconfigure the buttons of my windows so that they behave
like Motif buttons.  Problem is, I don't understand how they work.  Can
some kind soul point me to "newbie" information that explains how the
buttons work and how they are configured?

Thank you for your help.

Hi,

I used to work with olvwm but have decided to change for
performance/memory  issues.  One of the neat things I could do with
olvwm was to move windows from on section to the "pager" (in
fvwm-linguo) to another by selecting that window in the pager and moving
it elsewhere.  Is there something similar in fvwm?  If so, how does it
work?  So far, the only way I've been able to do so is by making the
window sticky, then moving to where I want it to appear and unstick it.
I find it somewhat cumbersome.  Of course, I could be patient and open
windows only where I want them to appear in the pager...

Thank you for any/all answers.

I can do this by using mouse button 2 in the pager to drag the window to 
its new location.  I didn't set up this behavior, so I have to assume the 
stock system.fvwmrc set this up.

RTFM.  Look for the discussion about the 'Mouse' directive.

Also, look in the FAQ (if you're using 2.xx) and it tells WWW pages to
visit, some of which have configuration info.

     Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will
     cause  that  window  to  be  move  to the location where you
     release the mouse button, but your viewport will not change.
     If  you drag the window out of the pager and onto your desk-
     top, a full size image of the window will appear for you  to
     place.  There  is no way to pick up a full size image of the
     window and move it into the pager, however. Since some  mice
     do not have button 2, I have made provisions to drag windows
     in the pager by using pressing modifier-1 (usually Alt)  and
     dragging with button 3.

Hope this helps,

Hello,

I think I've almost figured out my problems.  I'd like to thank everyone
who pointed out to me that I was reading the wrong man page for the
pager (silly me).  I've also gotten the hang of configuring the buttons.
Now I'm in the process of figuring out how to change the little icons
for the buttons and assigning proper Functions for moving, etc.

Thank you for your quick responses!

Hello Everyone,

Is there a way to pass a command directly to a module from a menu? 
For example, is something like this possible:

AddToMenu Backgrounds "Backgrounds" Title
...
+      "background4"      *FvwmBackerDesk 4 xpmroot /usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps/background4.xpm
...

Would it be necessary to call Module FvwmBack afterward?  Maybe FvwmForm 
could be used instead?  Any advice here would be great.




Thanks,

Chad

> Is there a way to pass a command directly to a module from a menu? 

not directly.  One way I see of doing what you want is try using a combo
of a 'read' command and a function:

AddToMenu Backgrounds "Backgrounds" Title
+      "background1%background1.xpm%"      Function bg1
+      "background2%background2.xpm%"      Function bg2
+      "background3%backgorund3.xpm%"      Function bg3
+      "background4%background4.xpm%"      Function bg4
AddToFunc bg1 "I" Read /home/whoever/.fvwm/fvwm-bg1
+ "I" FvwmBack
AddToFunc bg1 "I" Read /home/whoever/.fvwm/fvwm-bg2
+ "I" FvwmBack
AddToFunc bg1 "I" Read /home/whoever/.fvwm/fvwm-bg3
+ "I" FvwmBack
AddToFunc bg1 "I" Read /home/whoever/.fvwm/fvwm-bg4
+ "I" FvwmBack

and then have the contents of /home/whoeever/.fvwm/fvwm-bg1, for example, be:

*FvwmBackerDesk 4 xpmroot /usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps/background1.xpm

> Would it be necessary to call Module FvwmBack afterward?  Maybe FvwmForm

FvwmForm could be used, but personally, I like seeing a menu that SHOWS me
what background I'm about to select, selecting it, and watching it change with
no further ado.

BTW, I've not tested the above, so something might not work, but I think you
get the idea.

Hi. I am constantly using fvwm on both b/w monitors and color monitors.
Is there anyway to write my .fvwm2rc file such that it sets colors only 
when I am using a color monitor? (maybe I need to write some M4 macros 
somewhere?)

(i am using the latest fvwm2 distribution).

Thanx in advance.

I've been unable to use FvwmBacker with any sort of success.  I would
really like to set it up for my four different desktops.  Could someone
who has a working .fvwm2rc file that uses FvwmBacker please mail me a
copy of it.

I would share my .fvwm2rc file, but I'm afraid it's split into multiple
files and quite long.

I use fvwm2 on three different machines running pl37, pl38, and pl39.

Thanks,

-Alan Wild

cpp might be easier -- conditionalize your preferences in a file,
and read them in via FvwmCpp, e.g., I use it for font selection:

FvwmCpp ".fvwmrc-fonts"

where .fvwmrc-fonts contains:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
	Window and icon fonts
*/

#if Y_RESOLUTION >= 3700
#define WINDOWFONT	-adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#define ICONFONT	-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#else
#define WINDOWFONT	-adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#define ICONFONT	-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
#endif

WindowFont	WINDOWFONT
IconFont	ICONFONT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

so you could do something like:

FvwmCpp ".fvwmrc-colors"

where .fvwmrc-colors contains:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifdef COLOR

      color stuff

#else

      b/w stuff

#endif
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

for a list of symbols you can conditionalize on, run `xrdb -symbols'.

i have used fvwm backer extensively and have come up with the following 
configuration which worked well for me:

	*FvwmBackerDesk 0 xsetroot -solid "#266294"
	*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid #AA0000
	*FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid #FFCC00
	*FvwmBackerDesk 3 -solid #888800

colors can be changed and what not but i do find colors much nicer than
icons...


One other quick comment/question. I got quite sick of using the backer
because the colors of the desktop didn't show up in the pager. so i set up
a bunch of symbolic links (FvwmButtons to PagerButtons and FvwmPager to
IncPager*). then i set the background colors of each one to be the same as
the FvwmBacker colors.... now i could simply swallow all the IncPagers
into a FvwmButtons (PagerButtons under the symlink) and it looks just like
FvwmPager, but has colors. Here is the relevant code:

*IncPager0Back #266294
*IncPager1Back #AA0000
*IncPager2Back #FFCC00
*IncPager3Back #888800

*PagerButtons -     whatever    SwallowModule "IncPager0" IncPager0 0 0
*PagerButtons -     whatever    SwallowModule "IncPager1" IncPager1 1 1
*PagerButtons -     whatever    SwallowModule "IncPager2" IncPager2 2 2
*PagerButtons -     whatever    SwallowModule "IncPager3" IncPager3 3 3


Question is, is there an easier way to do this, or perhaps a more direct
way (yes, i admit this is a bit of a hack) ???

Thanks,
Shishir

Hello Everyone (including Chuck),

After installing and using fvwm2 for about a week now, I have been very
impressed with its performance.  However, I have found a few of 
problems that appear to be bugs of some sort,

1)  When I create an rlogin button, that is 

*FvwmButtons Routh xterm-sun.xpm  Exec "routh" xterm -geometry 80x40 -T routh -e rlogin -lfred routh &

The button does not pop back up afterwards, but stays stuck down forever.  If I use rsh instead of creating an xterm locally, then the button pops back 
up right away.  However, it is not always possible to use csh due to 
security methods on some workstations.  I noticed this problem with Netscape as well.  I have a button for Netscape that always sticks.

2)  I installed fvwm2 to use on a SPARCstation 20 with SunOS 4.1.3, which acts 
as a server for several other machines.  Everything works fine on the 20,
and on our SPARCstation 1's,  but on our SPARC IPC there is a problem with
changing pages using the mouse.  When the mouse is moved vertically off the
screen then it flips to the next screen (page) perfectly.  But, when the
the mouse is moved horizontally off the screen then it does not flip to the 
next page unless the mouse is moved *VERY* slowly.  I have tried adjusting
the EdgeResistance from 0 0 through 350 100, and nothing fixed this behavior.
In my opinion this bug is the most serious that I have seen with fvwm2 because
flipping pages by mouse motion is one of the *best* features of fvwm2. 

3)  If the SaveDesk module is used, with a 'Read .fvwmdesk' at the end of the
.fvwm2rc file, then FvwmForm no longer works, i.e. I have a QuitVerify module 
that uses FvwmForm as given in the FvwmForm man page and this works so 
long as the 'Read .fvwmdesk' is not used.  A strange bug!?

4)  If FvwmBacker is used to set up some intial backgrounds with xpmroot or
xv or xsetroot, the 'xv -root -quit -max filename.gif' is used from a menu
to set a background on one desk, then all of the desks are changed to that 
image.  Flipping desks does not change back to the default background.  If 
xpmroot is used from a menu, then only the current desk is changed, but
when flipping back to this desk, the default background is back.  This is 
because FvwmBacker has not been made aware of this change.  A proper cure
for both of these problems is to provide a way for menu items to send commands
directly to FvwmBacker or any other module for that matter.  Todd Fries
offered a nice solution to this problem by using a complex function and
Read command with a separate file for each background, each file containing
the command to be passed to the FvwmBacker module.

5)  When the FvwmConfig is used to to change the default Back and Fore 
colors of window borders,  the FvwmButtons bar loses its Style ClickToFocus.



Has anyone else experienced these problems or does anyone have hacks or 
work-arounds for them?  In my opinion, these issued need to be addressed 
before an official non-beta version of fvwm2 can be released.





Thanks,

Chad

Hello Everyone,

Is it possible to create variables inside of the the .fvwm2rc file?
Perhaps

			  UserNameId  = chadc 

Maybe it is only possible with M4 or Cpp?




Thanks,

Chad
