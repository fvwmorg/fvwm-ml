Now that you mention it, this happens to me too. I use a file sharing
program called Phex (phex.sourceforge.org) and it always appears spread
across my 2 dual monitors (but not completely filling them) whereas it
would appear on whichever contained my pointer if it were obeying FVWM.

Phex is the only program I've seen behave this way, and it's also the
only Java program that I use.

Is there a solution? It's not a big problem for me, just a minor irritati=
on.

This is a Java problem.

Java looks for a few different window managers, and if it doesn't
find them, it misbehaves.  Fvwm is not on the list of window managers
that it looks for.

We've contacted the Java developers, and its my understanding that
Java 1.4 should start working better.

Note:  this style was removed in the transition from fvwm-1.x to
fvwm-2.x.

> # NoPPosition instructs fvwm to ignore the PPosition field in window

NoPPosition only prevents that programs can set their initial
size using the PPos (program specified position) hint.  They can
still enforce their position with the user specified position
hints (which fvwm is forbidden to ignore by the spec), or change
their position afterwards.  In 2.4.x, there is no way to prevent
thisi.  But because of the ever growing number of applications
whose developers think they know better where the windows should
appear than the user, I've implemented a few new styles to control
that behaviour in 2.5.x:

  Style * NoUSPosition
  Style * FixedPSize

You may want to apply these styles only to the misbehaving
windows, not all windows.  The latest release is fvwm-2.5.2, but
it is *unstable* and may crash at any time, when the wrong
features are used (there are known crashes with dynamic menus and
the MenuStyle command not using the default style).

Bye

Hello,

I've got Quake 3 installed and it completely takes control of all mouse 
an keyboard input while it's running, which is understandable most of 
the time.

What I'd like to know is if there is a way I can set a keystroke to 
break out of Quake and back in to the normal desktop? I'm guessing this 
all depends on whether FVWM gets taken out the loop completely while 
Quake is running or whether it is cooperatively passing all input 
through to it.

Can anyone help?

Cheers,

Andy

One solution for the "top left corner out of view" problem is to use FvwmEvent
bound to a configure_window event.  The FvwmEvent's "Cmd" would be a function
that targets "AWTapp" or "VendorShell" windows and moves them right or down if
the window's x or y is less than a certain threshold (e.g., roughly the border
width or title height, respectively).

There is no way for other X applications to receive keyboard input
while another application has grabbed the keyboard exclusively.
The only keystrokes that may work are the ones the X server handles
directly, e.g. ctrl-alt-f1 to switch to a console and kill quake
there.

	We used to have some luck using an ugly hack that's still in the fvwm code. Try
adding the following to your .fvwm2rc:

BugOpts ModalityIsEvil True

	This sets a property on the root window that causes Java (well, all Motif
programs that use the XmIsMotifWMRunning() function, really) to think that mwm
is running, and it makes some adjustments to its behavior. This may work for
you. We'd certainly like to hear if it still works with the 1.4 jdk. (Don't even
ask about the name of the option - it hasn't performed its original function in
years.)


Cheers,
Bob

I suggest to start an application that fully grabs X in a separate server.
Then just switch between Ctrl-Alt-F7 and Ctrl-Alt-F8 although it may be
slow if a game consumes 100% of CPU. Just tried this with XFree86-4.2.0
and prboom, works ok. I remember XFree86-4.0.1 or so hanged when switching
from one server display to another or to a virtual console and back.

Mikhael.

I voted for the bug. The solution suggested by Dominik requires the unsta=
ble=20
version, and I don't think I am ready for that.

The "BugOpts ModalityIsEvil True" hack doesn't work for me. This is proba=
bly=20
because Java 2 uses Metal (swing) as default instead of motif (??).=20

So, I guess I have to bear on this annoying thing for now... <sigh>..
Thanks anyway for all reponds.

I use 2.5.2 on my system, and it runs perfectly well. There are no
random crashes or bugs that I have seen. You might try it, if you want
to ;)

While it's true it's unstable by name I've been using it (because it 
contains a feature Dominik kindly implemented to solve a problem I was 
having with two different sized monitors in a dual head set up) for a 
while now and I haven't had a single problem with it.

I don't do anything particularly weird with FVWM, so I'm probably not 
pushing it at all, but it's been rock solid for me.

Now, if I could just stop the NVidia drivers from occasionally locking 
the machine up with X shuts down everything'd be peachy.. ;)

Cheers,

Andy

Hi,

I'm using "Popup MyMenu" for a mouse action on a button of ButtonsBar.
Now the problem is:
as soon as the mouse button is released the menu is closed and if the
mouse pointer was on a menu-item, that item is activated.

This does not happen with the start-menu/ utilities-menu/ root-menu
which are activated from the FvwmTaskBar or the backdrop. Even if I use
"MyMenu" as the TaskBar's start menu then also the menu is not closed
after the mouse-button is released.

Could you please confirm:
whether i can get the same behavior with a menu on ButtonsBar.
To clarify my requirement -
I need the menu(used on FvwmButton) to be still open even after I
release the mouse-button(s).

Thanks in advance.
Sourabh.

That's exactly how it is supposed to work.  The "Popup" command
opens a menu and closes it as soon as the button is released.  You
should use the "Menu" command instead.  It holds the menu open
when the button is released first and allows you to click the menu
to select an entry.  So, just replace "Popup MyMenu" with
"Menu MyMenu".

Hi,

     I just looked at the Java bug report and they experimented with a
fix for Java 1.4 and decided its a fvwm bug. The comment in the bug
evaluation says that fvwm ignores gravity when handling
ConfigureRequests. Perhaps one of the current fvwm developers could
take a look at this and see if this is true and if it fixes the
problem. If its not the problem you might try contacting Sun about
bug # 4401846. Perhaps the 2 sets of developers (fvwm and Java) can
get this resolved together.

That's complete nonsense.  Fvwm is the only window manager I know
of that *does* handle gravity in ConfigureRequest events.

It may be complete nonsense. However, unless you (or another fvwm
developer) get in touch with the Java group this problem is unlikely
to ever get fixed.

I'm not trying to say who's problem it is. I certainly don't know.
But we have the classical case of 2 different groups each saying
the other group has the bug. It will never get fixed unless the
2 groups communicate.

Well, do you want the problem fixed or not? This problem was serious
enough I stopped using fvwm for several months (I'm back now :-).

Can you tell us where you are getting this information, all I see
is this:

According to the report, it sounds like this test works fine with Sawfish and
dtwm, and has problems only with fvwm and fvwm2.
xxxxx@xxxxx 2001-01-04

See also 4457472.  Commit to fix in Tiger.
xxxxx@xxxxx 2001-05-18

Reproducible on build 1.4.0-beta_refresh-b70.
xxxxx@xxxxx 2001-07-11

Ie., it looks like an open bug.

I'm a Sun developer so I can look at the corporate bug database rather
than the one you see from developer.java.sun.com. There is a more
recent evaluation from 8/2 which isn't in the version I see from the
java web site.

I'll see if I can get authorization to send the full evaluation to
this list (it shouldn't be hard to get). I doubt its intentionally
not on the external page but suspect the external (ie, viewable from
the java web pages) just isn't as up-to-date as it should be.

Its still open but I doubt if the bug will get serious consideration
again unless somebody can convince the JDK developer their evaluation
is wrong (this is what I'm hoping to get the fvwm developers to do :-)

	A golden opportunity. Let's grab it!

	This bug report is really a restatement of bug # 4102292, the great-grand-daddy
of these reports (open since Jan 07, 1998, with a long list of public comments
including a Happy Birthday message to the bug). In a nutshell, the problem is
that Java insists on placing windows at 0,0 if the program hasn't specified
placement coordinates. It correctly calculates the offsets for the window
decorations for relatively simple WM's - e.g., twm - and adjusts accordingly. It
calculates them incorrectly for WM's that do double (or more) reparenting of the
top level window.

	There are actually over 40 bug reports (that we can see on the public list,
anyway) over the past 4.5 years (since around jdk 1.1.5) describing what is
substantially the same problem. Some reference other window managers (e.g., the
GNOME and KDE WM's); some describe the symptoms a bit differently, and so on;
but they all boil down to the same misfeature.

	The infuriating thing about the 1.4 release is that we had developed a hack
that worked - setting the property on the root window that made the JVM think
the mwm was running, and it seemed to be happy enough to let mwm decide where to
place the windows without interfering. We've now had to work on other hacks to
try to get around the problem.

	The fundamental question I see in all this is: what earthly purpose is served
by trying to force the top level window positions to 0,0? What would it take to
convince the Sun developers that this is genuinely a Bad Thing?

	That would be great, if you can!

	We'll certainly try.

Hi!

Is there a way to make the cursor place itself in the middle of the
screen everytime I start FVWM?

Please read
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#id2751228

and when you are done your hint is "CursorMove".

Hi,

     I just got email from the owner of this bug. He said the public
version of hte bug report will get updated in the next several days
but that he had no problem with my posting it. He also seemed very
willing to work with fvwm developers towards resolution.

     As you can see, it doesn't say much more than I did in my email.
I suggest you add a comment to the bug report giving your email and
who you are. Hopefully, the jdk developer will contact you and you
two can work out a resolution. I can't wait to have my netbeans windows
start at the right location :-)

Gordon

=====================================================================


xxx@xxxxxxxxxxx  2002-08-02

This is an fvwm2 bug, it ignores gravity when handling ConfigureRequest's.

$ wish
% wm geometry .
200x200+0+0
% wm geometry . +1+1

That request to move window to +1+1 will move the window title off-screen.

We have a code to work around this problem that is activated for E!
and IceWM, but I feel this is the wrong thing to do - when the gravity
bug is fixed, the workaround will cause problems.  Since there are
several popular WMs with this bug, perhaphs the workaround shall be
conditionalized on a property or an environment variable.

Actually, you cut the most interesting part from the message:  the
name of the window causing the problem.  Anyway, the application
requested a mximum height for the window (551 pixels) that is
smaller than the requested minimum size (580 pixels).  Fvwm can
handle this situation, but it is a good idea to tell the
application developers about this bug.

Actually CursorMove currently only accepts relative values, not absolute
ones, so this is not trivial. This function does it, but in 2.5.1+ only:

  AddToFunc WarpToScreenCenter
  + I PipeRead 'echo CursorMove `expr "(" $[vp.width] - $[pointer.x] "*" 2 ")" / 2`p `expr "(" $[vp.height] - $[pointer.y] "*" 2 ")" / 2`p'

This shorter solution should work in 2.4.x too (zero is optional):

  WindowId root 0 WarpToWindow 50 50

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

I use the SloppyFocus option in my default style and it behaves not
entirely as I expected. When the window that has the input focus
gets closed, another window on the desktop automatically gets the input
focus - even if the pointer is outside the window. In this special case
we could get the focus to the root window (or no window if this is
possible). Is this possible and if not will it be implemented?

thanx,
ron

PS: The fvwm version I use is 2.5.2.

Hi,

I have the following problems with xawtv and fvwm 2.5.2: When I switch
into fullscreen mode then the TV screen is partly outside the physical
screen, i.e. I have only a half TV screen. In this case I need to move
the mouse a bit upward to get the whole TV screen.

The second problem arises when I switch back to "window mode". Then it
happens by a chance of ~50% that the window is black. To get it working
again in _non-fullscreen_ mode I need to restart xawtv. Switching back
from the black window into fullscreen mode works but when I then switch
to "window mode" again the window diappears entirely but I can get it
back if I use the window list module. 

It would be nice if someone could fix this strange behavior.

thx,
ron

Hi,

When I use fvwm as the WM for GNOME and try to open another X on another
display then fvwm doesn't get started. I need to manually start fvwm
then. Is this a bug or do I need a special command line switch?

Hello, all!
I'd trying to get an fvwm 2.4.8 installed on an netbsd 1.5, but fvwm2 do
not find the xpm. When I'd try to run the configure script, it comes up
with "XPM support    NO". An piece of config.log:

</quote>
This looked like something were wrong in my xpm support. I checked
version of the xpm, and it were xpm 3.4k. fvwm2 requires 3.4g, I'd
assume this is OK. I'd like to check the xpm installation, I downloaded
xpm from ftp.x.org, and installed it in a new directory, not to muck up
the NetBSD package system. The configure script were given proper xpm
options to find the xpm, but got the same negative result. Could xpm not
be backwards compatible? Is there done anything in xpm 3.4k that make
any program looking for xpm 3.4g fail?

Of course I'd get no icons, and when I'd tries to use an .fwvm2rc that
is supposed to look like win 95, I do not get any button bar, I'd think
that is because xpm read is failing, and make the button bar fail too.

Hope somebody have an remedy for this, I'll be very grateful for any
tip.

If gnome-session reuses the same session when run under another DISPLAY
(and this is what it seems to do) it will not work. FVWM saves -d argument
in gnome-session, this is needed for multihead and some other cases.

I suggest you to define one session for each DISPLAY and run gnome-session
with one or another session as argument depending on DISPLAY.
There will not be such problem if 2 different sessions are used, I think.
The benefit of this is also that you have 2 sets of applications that
are restored on different displays instead of one set. This is probably
what you want, otherwise you would not open another X.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It seems that the program is compiled, but returns a non zero.

To be sure, compose this small program myxpmtest.c:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/xpm.h>
int main() {
	printf("XpmIncludeVersion=%d, XpmLibraryVersion=%d\n",
		XpmIncludeVersion, XpmLibraryVersion());
}

Compile it using:

  % gcc -o myxpmtest -I/usr/local/xpm-3.4k/exports/include/X11 -L/usr/local/xpm-3.4k/lib -lX11 -lXpm myxpmtest.c

and run it. You should see the problem better.
It prints for me: XpmIncludeVersion=30411, XpmLibraryVersion=30411.

Theoretically a button bar (do you mean FvwmTaskBar or FvwmButtons?)
should work without an xpm support. If it is started when you manage to
build with xpm support, post your relevant configuration lines.

Probably neither.  It depends on how fvwm is started in your
system and how you start the second X server.  Since you are using
gnome, the fvwm on the first X Server is probably started via gdm
(the gnome display manager).  If you started the second X Server
with "xinit" or "startx", you should put the line starting fvwm in
your $HOME/.xinitrc.  Personally, I have a menu entry that starts
the second X server with

  exec xinit /bin/sleep 100000 -- :1

and another entry that invokes fvwm on it

  fvwm2 -d :1 $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

If you still have trouble with this, please provide more details
on how you start your X servers and fvwm.

Is that the only output?  No explanation of what went wrong?  In
this case, compilation of the test program must have failed, but
there is no indication of this in the ouput below.  Did you by any
chance overlook the error message

Why is this line chopped into pieces?

3.4k is fine.  Maybe you have multiple xpm versions on your system
that interfere with each other.

No, it's not possible right now, but I'm currently rewriting the
code handling focus policies and there will be an option that
allows to control this situation.

You probably have something like

  Style * NoPPosition

in your config file to formid applications to place their own
windows.  Try disabling that line or use something like

  Style xawtv PPosition

afterwards to override the global style (possibly replace "xawtv" 
with the name, resource or class of the window).

Lacking the necessary hardware I can't take a look at xawtv
myself, but this all sounds as if xawtv is doing something wrong.
Have you asked the xawtv developers about this?

Note: If it has compiled, there must be an explanation in thei
configure summary.  If there was no explanation, then the program
was not successfully compiled or not started.

Sorry, this is not correct. The helpful explanation is always printed
regardless of the failed stage. Since there is no such answer as "NO", but
"no: explanation", it is clear that Sigmund just did not write it down.

Ah yes, I unserstand the problem.  I've made a different patch
that does not prevent this bindings in general but only when there
are no "better" matches for the keysym (i.e. if there are no keys
that generate the keysym without any modifiers or with just shift
or caps-lock).   Try this code in place of the "default" clause
you modified in Bindings.c:

	default:
	  /* key generates the key sym with unknown modifiers depressed -
	   * can't map that to specific modifiers - treat as no modifiers */
	  if (modifiers != AnyModifier)
	  {
	    /* but don't bind it again if already bound with shift, caps-lock
	     * or no modifiers */
	    check_bound_mask = 0x7;
	  }
	  break;

But it *is* correct.  If compilation fails, you don't get an
explanation:

    [edit configure.in, add a syntax error in the C code]
    $ grep --before-context=1 --after-context=4 "#error" configure.in
    AC_TRY_RUN([#include <X11/xpm.h>
-->  #error
     int main(int c, char **v) {
     return c == 1 ? 0 :
       XpmIncludeVersion != XpmLibraryVersion() ? 1 :
       XpmIncludeVersion < 30407 ? 2 : 0 ;}],
    $ autoreconf > /dev/null && ./configure | grep "With XPM"
-->   With XPM image support?             no
                                         ^^^^

You probably missed the answer to your question (see below).  I
prefer to get all mail over the mailing lists.

With the pager that comes with fvwm-2.x, clicking with the middle
mouse button on a window gives it focus.  So you need to click
twice to get the effect you want.

> But I am just wondering why the behavior was changed,

I have no idea.  This change was made before I began working on
fvwm more than four years ago.  But as a developer I appreciate
this much:  I sometimes have to focus a window on a different
page.

> and if there are any plans to get the behavior I would like.

There are very vague plans to implement configurable actions in
the pager, but they are so far down on the priority list that it
may take years before the work is done.

Since you appear to have the XPM library installed in a non-standard
place, you need to follow the instructions in the INSTALL.fvwm file.

Look at the section titled:
"Shared Libraries in Non-standard Places".

I seem to be having a problem with FvwmIconMan on SunOS 5.6 with Fvwm 2.4.8.
It doesn't seem to take any mouse clicks.  In the past (on different
systems) it has been just fine, so it might not be a bug, per se, just
something strange going on.

For testing this problem, the only contents of my .fvwm2rc file is this:

AddToFunc InitFunction "I" Module FvwmIconMan
AddToFunc RestartFunction "I" Module FvwmIconMan
*FvwmIconMan: action Mouse 1 N sendcommand Iconify

I click the icon man with mouse 1 and nothing happens to either normal
windows are the iconified ones.  Once I iconify, I have to use the window
list to get it back.

It does know the mouse is over it, because the mouse-over stuff is
happening, it flattens the button (at least in the default set-up).

Any help would be nice.

Thanks, as always.

I can't reproduce it, works just fine with 2.4.8. This does not work with
2.4.7, because 2.4.7 only understands the now-obsolete FvwmIconMan syntax.

Are you sure you don't have Num Lock pressed?
Anyway, "A" will do the work better than "N" here.

Regards,
Mikhael.

It doesn't work (I acutally tried it), and I know why. Perhaps my
description of the problem wasn't exact enough. Have a look at
# xmodmap -pke | grep section
keycode  39 = s S ssharp section
keycode  49 = section degree notsign

What I want to bind is keycode 49 with no modifier pressed. The loop
iterates through each keycode, and executes for keycode 39 the default
statement, and binds it. It doesn't care about the "better" match
(keycode 49), and binds both, with no modifiers, which makes the "s" key
unuseable. The result was, that without my patch, I was unable to bind
the section key properly.

What I would accept is that it binds to the "s" key only if no other
keycode is able to produce the section keysym. I thought about that, and
I think it would be more expensive to implement.

Please CC me any response, I am still not subscribed to the list.

You mean UsePPosition?! This doesn't help. xawtv just switches the
screen resolution and does not recreate the window so the placement is
not the problem I think. With sawfish as WM I had no problems.

Not yet, since I have this problem since I use fvwm. With sawfish I
did not see this behavior.

Is anyone here on the list who can reproduce this?

I now found out that it happens only if the window is positioned in the
lower and/or right half of the screen. The more it is positioned in
these directions the more off-screen it will be in fullscreen mode.

This is ok, just add -L/usr/X11R6/lib and probably you will be able to
compile the test program, supply additional parameter to gcc if not.
If you want icons, you should successfully build and run this xpm test.

It is strange that you don't get the gcc or cpp/ld error in config.log.

So, returning to your problem, the correct options for you seem to be:

  ./configure --with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/xpm-3.4k/exports/include \
    --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/xpm-3.4k/lib

Please write to the list.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Please try the next snapshot or current CVS code.  That should
resolve the problem.

For years, I thought these mappings were server dependent and that
there was no way to figure them out.  Finally, I understood that
the mappings have no fixed meaning.  When you look at the output
of "xmodmap -pke" you can see that several keysyms can be bound to
a single keycode.  The first column denotes the symbol without any
modifiers pressed.  The second column denotes the symbol in
conjunction with shift.  But that's nothing the X server enforces,
it is merely a convention among all X clients.  All further
columns can be interpreted individually by each application.

So, the fix was simply to associate some modifiers with these
columns instead of whining about "unknown" modifiers.

I'm going to add that patch to the next stable release too
(2.4.9).  This version will be released within one or two
weeks.

Hello, I'm sort of new to fvwm and don't know anything about anything.
Thanks, guys (if you who make it are reading this).

What I want to know is how I make the AutoRaise module start automatically
when I log in to X.

Thanks for whatever help I can get,

Johann

Place the lines

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I FvwmAuto 500

in you $HOME/.fvwm2rc file.  Although its very big, the man page
is a good source of fvwm related information, but don't hesitate
to ask questions on the mailing list - that's its main purpose.

Hello,

I'm looking for a step by step fvwm2 tutorial to start with an empty

Thanks,

Start up Fvwm with no .fvwm2rc file.
Click on the root window.
Choose either "Setup Form" or "Setup 95 Script".
Either one will create a starting .fvwm2rc file complete
with comments.

Module from loading at startup, but if i invoked it from FvwmCommand,
then fvwm crashed :(

Please locate the core file that fvwm left and run

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

and post the output of that command along with your
$HOME/.fvwm2rc.

While I agree the fvwm man page is extensive and a good source of info,
it's (unfortunately) hardly a tutorial. Of course, man pages aren't
generally meant to be tutorials, but it would certainly be nice to have
one somewhere. I saw one other post on the list of a small tutorial and
have read that, but that's apparently about it. I get the feeling I
won't understand much of anything until some magic moment after reading
enough when it all comes together at once...

I've seen many sample .fvwm2rc's that can walk and talk and create an
amazing desktop, but trying to learn the fundamentals of fvwm from them
is a bit like trying to learn to drive with your first car being a top
fuel dragster... :-)

I'm VERY early on in my fvwm career and am still flailing about more
than a bit, so a more stepwise approach would be great if anyone knows
of one out there. In fact, it was the 'blessing' of a 233mHz laptop with
only 64MB that pushed me in the direction of fvwm. KDE is slow on that
machine and Gnome is out of the question. Of course, when you add what
KDE and Gnome do to a system's interface configuration in general, it
just muddies the waters for everything else.

To be at least a little on-topic to the original subject, I'd like to
discover how to (for example) have a terminal or other app automatically
launch each time fvwm starts. I guess I'll find it in the multitude man
pages eventually. :-) Being able to Alt+Tab or equivalent between pages
(is that right? pages? or desktops?) would be nice, but I _do_ recall
seeing that addressed in the FAQ, so I'll have to read up on it.

A complete tutorial might be several times larger than the man pages...

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec xterm


The man pages are pretty helpful.
It helps a lot if you use some kind of tool to read the pages,
don't just type "man fvwm2" on the command line.
I find XEmacs to be a great man page browser.

*Sigh*  Yes, the documentation is one of the biggest open issues
with fvwm, but we don't have the people and/or the infrastructure
to do it right.  We'd need somebody who is able and willing to set
up en environment in which the man page and other doc formats can
be generated from a single source.

Hi,
I'm having trouble getting fvwm-menu-desktop to
recognize kde3.  Gnome menus work fine.  

Any suggestions,

I don't know how much KDE 3 is incompatible with KDE 2.
Do you have the correct $KDEDIR set?

Debug this script from a command line, try different option, like:

  % fvwm-menu-desktop --desktop kde --install-prefix /opt/kde3 --lang

Mikhael.

Perhaps I have a poor attention span, but I've long had a problem with
keeping my key mappings and functions-present-in-menus in sync; I would
generally like to be able to do most things with a keystroke, and would
still like every such action available in a menu if brain fade prevents
me remembering the magic keystoke.

Thus today's exercise. Two functions, KeyFn and MouseFn to set a key or
mouse mapping and also record it in a menu:

	# KeyFn menu desc keyname context mods "cmd-and-args"
	DestroyFunc KeyFn
	AddToFunc KeyFn         "I"             Key $2 $3 $4 $5
	+                       "I"             AddToMenu $0 "$1" $5

	# MouseFn menu desc button context mods "cmd-and-args"
	DestroyFunc MouseFn
	AddToFunc MouseFn       "I"             Mouse $2 $3 $4 $5
	+                       "I"             AddToMenu $0 "$1" $5

Now my menu definitions are a bit wordier, but nothing will
slip through the cracks:

	DestroyMenu WinOps
	AddToMenu WinOps        "Window Ops"    Title
	KeyFn WinOps "Desk Windows"             L A M           "WindowList (CurrentDesk) Alphabetic SelectOnRelease
	[...]
	KeyFn WinOps "Raise"                    H W CS          "Raise"
	KeyFn WinOps "Lower"                    H W CS          "Lower"
	MouseFn WinOps "Resize"                 1 W M           "Resize"
	MouseFn WinOps "Move"                   2 W M           "Move"
	Mouse                                   3 W M           Move
	[...]

Remark on that last: I often have mouse 3 do what mouse 2 does because I
switch keyboards a lot. So one incantation for M2 to put it in the menu,
and a conventional binding for M3 to match.

Cheers,

What kind of infrastructure did you have in mind?

I'm personally very fond of POD as a source format for most stuff, since
it's unassuming and very easy to edit and read, and readily generates
other formats. Does require perl though.

Idea: possibly a separate "fvwmtut" manual entry should accompany the main
man page?

Without anyone here being able to run xawtv, I can only suggest
that you contact tha xawtv developers and prod them to debug the
problem.  Chances are very good that it's an xawtv problem anyway.
Most multimedia player authors don't seem to know how to program a
good X applications :-)

Nice idea.  Here's an enhancement that displays the key binding
in the right column of the menu:

  + "I" AddToMenu $0 "$1<Tab>($4-$2)" $5

Replace <Tab> with a real tab.

For what it's worth: motv (the Motif version of xawtv) on fvwm 2.4.6
with NoPPosition works like a charm.  No problems with full screen mode.

Hi,

I was just writing this big email about how to get my gnomeicu window to grab
focus when I pop it up with the key binding that I created for it.  Then I
tried adding a +I Wait GnomeICU into the function that does the popping up,
and it worked!

If anyone is interested, this is how I did it:

AddToFunc gnomeicu-showhide
+ I Exec exec gnomeicu-client showhide
+ I Wait GnomeICU
+ I All (GnomeICU) Move 80 10
+ I All (GnomeICU) Raise
+ I All (GnomeICU) FlipFocus

Key A A CS Function gnomeicu-showhide

Actually, now I have some questions: when I select a name to send a message
to and hit enter on the name, the message dialog pops up, but at random
locations on the screen, and it doesn't have focus.  Is it possible to have it
always pop up in the centre and grab focus?  Is this just some funky event
thing?  Perhaps I should just read up about that.. :)

The second thing is that with the above function, gnomeicu pops up at some
random location but is then moved to 80%, 10% on the screen, so you see it pop
up elsewhere before it moves to that location.  Is there a way to not have it
do this?  Because it's kind of ugly.

But apart from those minor problems (which I'm sure can be easily fixed with
recipe tweaking) fvwm is still my favorite window manager!

Most likely, gnumeicu is moving its windows around the desktop.
Fvwm never moves a window to one place and then another (unless
specifically told to do so).

To tell fvwm to honour the position of the message dialog as the
application set it, try

  Style <name_of_dialog_window> UsePPosition

in your .fvwm2rc (or remove the NoPPosition style from the config
file).  If that doesn't work or the dialog comes up at a place
where you don't like it, try setting the position in your
$HOME/.Xdefaults file:

  <resource_name>.geometry: +x+y

(you can find out the resource name with the FvwmIdent module).
Then issue the command

  $ xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults

to tell X about the changed file.

The most important thing is:  don't just be angry about what it
does but tell the developers you hate that, that applications
shouldn't move around their windows because you know better where
you want them.  People have to be discouraged to write
applications this way.

Now your answer:  in the latest development versions (2.5.2 and
later), there are new styles that allow full control over what the
client may and may not do.  It may be the sledgehammer method, but
as a last resort it should work:

  Style <class_name> NoPPosition, FixedPPosition

If that still doesn't work, try this in addition:

  Style <class_name> FixedUSPosition

(If the latter line does work, it indicates clearly a bug in the
application).

Hello,

I've been using shaped desktop icons which look very spiffy but
present a frequent problem.  When I go to click on an icon, about half
the time (depending on the icon) I end up clicking on a transparent
part of the icon, which gets passed through to the desktop.  The
result is that the root menu pops up instead of the intended
deiconification.

This behavior differs from some other window managers (and M$ Windows)
where clicking within the bounds of the icon, even on transparent
portions of the icon, results in a click on the icon itself.  This
looks just as nice and makes for a less error-prone experience.

Is there some easy config fix for this in FVWM that I've missed in the
man page?  I know I could just not use shaped icons, or use more dense
icons, but that would detract from the spiffiness.

Barring a configuration fix, has anyone given any thought to how this
could be implemented in FVWM?  My knowledge of the X Shape extension
is limited but I don't believe that it allows you to catch clicks
passed to transparent portions of the window.  Technically, there is
no transparent part of the window (I think).  Am I wrong?

One thought I had would be to implement an non-shaped InputOnly window
over the shaped pixmap icon window.  Then map/move/resize it along
with the pixmap icon window.  But looking through the code this would
seem to be a big change.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks,

Steve

Hi,
earlier I was using 2.4.6 about 4 months back. Then I migrated to the
devel series 2.5.x
Whenever I start FVWM, and then do Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to the tty where I
ran the command=20
$ startx
I get about ten warnings from Fvwm in the following format.

[FVWM][ewmh_HandleDesktop]: <<WARNING>> An Desktop application
<0xe00072> already run! This can cause problem

Please tell me how I can get rid of these messages.
thanks

This means that you have several applications running that claim
to manage the desktop real estate.  It's probably some application
like nautilus that manages the icons sticking on the desktop
background.  Most likely, this has happened by accident.  Find out
which applications are competing for the desktop and prevent one
of them from starting.

All the problems you describe should be gone now.  There is one
incompatibility however.  The ClickToFocus/MouseFocus/SloppyFocus/
NeverFocus style must be set as *first* of all the focus related
styles.  These for reset almost all others when issued, e.g. in

  Style * ClickToFocusRaisesOff, ClickToFocusPassesClickOff
  Style * ClickToFocus

The first line is completely overridden by the second.  Instead,

  Style * ClickToFocus
  Style * ClickToFocusRaisesOff, ClickToFocusPassesClickOff

must be used.

Hi!

I'm using FVWM on alot of diffrent clients and some of them have
diffrent screenresulutions.=20

My question is this; is it possible to get a FvwmButton-bar to automaticl=
y
adjust to the screens vertical size (100%)?

I now one sulution is to just source diffrent fc-files depending on
$HOST, but that's kind of ugly...

Regards, Johan Svedberg

Take a look at FvwmM4 and specify the width after the width of
the screen.

With 2.4.0 or later:

  *FvwmButtonsGeometry $[vp.width]x57+-2-0

Replace the -2 with the width of the decorations.

That's a part of the job to figure that out.  Somethings that is
easy to understand and fun to read and yet gradually introduces
more advanced features to show fvwm's flexibility.

I'm a complete newbie inrespect to documentation formats.  Some
basic requirements are:

 - Must be convertible to various other formats (man page, ps,
   html and possible GNU Texinfo) and must look good in these
   formats.
 - The tools must works on any system and should run out of the
   box.  Everybody must be able to edit the documentation.
 - The format should be reasonably easy to edit without any tools
   other than a text editor.

Perl is no problem, we already use it.

Why not?  A real tutorial that comes with the sources would be
nice.  Several people have done some work in the past.  I
appreciate all this work a lot.  Everything is still in my inbox.
The biggest problem is that people do some work without
coordinating it on the fvwm-workers list, then dump the result on
the list in some random format that we neither have the tools for
and that isn't convertible, then vanish into thin air :-/

We need somebody that can spend some time on the documentation to

 * Introduce the documentation infrastructure.
 * Instruct us hackers how to use it.
 * Intergrates the necessary framework into the source tree
   (configure tests, "make" targets, etc.)
 * At least helps to convert the existing docs to that format.

And if (s)he wants to be even more helpful:

 * Examines all the existing documentation and puts in together in
   a nice and shiny new tutorial, short reference, commented
   exmaple configs etc.

I'd be willing to provide any help with the contents, but I can't
find the time and leisure to do everything myself.

Bye

It does all these, except texinfo, but it will emit latex if you really
care.

if they have perl, definitely.

Yes. It's damn near plain text with very simple and unintrusive markup.

Yep. That's what I like about it.

Cool.

Will have to address the 2nd half of your message later.

Meanwhile, "man perlpod" will describe the format for you. Here's a shell
script with its own manual page inlined (I pull it out and format with
a script):

	http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/scripts/lz

Here's the HTML page that makes.

	http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/man/lz.1.html

The manual page looks exactly like a regular manual page.

The leading hashes aren't part of the format - they're just shell comments
to hide the POD from the shell. Typical pod is:

	=head1 A Heading

	Here's an example paragraph
	that will be filled (line flowed) by whatever backend format gets used.
	Here's a reference to the fvwm(1) manual page.
	Here's some literal (unfilled) text:

		DestroyFunc foo
		AddToFunc foo	Next

	Here's the next paragraph with a B<bold> word.

Very user friendly.

| 
|   + "I" AddToMenu $0 "$1<Tab>($4-$2)" $5

Heh. I was trying to find the right syntax for _exactly_ that
change. Applied. Thanks!

Hi,

I created an xpm file as a new mouse pointer. This works fine. But can
you tell me how to define the hotspot?

I guess I should be able do it with a graphics application like the gimp
and define it inside the xpm file. But up to now I don't find any
command to do it. Could you tell me how you do it?

Thank You,
 Felix

I've never found out how to create an xpm with a hotspot.  But you
can trick fvwm into using the correct hotspot by using a larger
image and shifting it so that the hotspot is in the middle of the
picture.  E.g. if your image looks like this:


  *xx..
  xx...
  x.x..
  ...x.
  ....x

  * = hotspot
  x = black
  . = transparent

Pad it like this:

  .........
  .........
  .........
  .........
  ....*xx..
  ....xx...
  ....x.x..
  .......x.
  ........x

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Heres how to create an XPM with a hotspot (from the XPM docs):

The Values-string is a single  string that must contain four  integers
that correspond to the  width and height of  the pixmap, the number of
colors in the  pixmap, and the number  of characters per  pixel in the
color specification.  The string  can  optionally specify the  hotspot
coordinates   and  the   word  XPMEXT   if   the  pixmap  includes  an
Extensions-string.

The format of the string is as follows:
 width height ncolors cpp [x_hotspot y_hotspot] [XPMEXT]


The hotspot is available to the program thru the XpmAttributes
structure.

Sure.

I haven't checked that Fvwm actually uses the hotspot if defined.

As far as I remember, I implemented hotspot handling with the
pixmap cursors a while ago.  From cursors.c:


  if (!PImageLoadCursorPixmapFromFile(
    dpy, Scr.Root, path, &source, &mask, &x, &y))
                                         ^^^^^^ hotspot coords
  ...
  Scr.FvwmCursors[index] = XCreatePixmapCursor(
    dpy, source, mask, &(colors[0]), &(colors[1]), x, y);
                                                   ^^^^

Yes, by calling a shell script:

I can confirm that fvwm (2.4.7) honors cursor hotspots.  On Solaris, I
use the "dticon" utility to create most of the cursors I use.  Dticon
lets you set a cursor's hotspot with a mouse click on its enlarged image.

Can I continue to thank FVWM developers for your efforts and congratulate you
in your successes in maintaining and evolving FVWM -- probably the best window
manager in the world? :-)

Annoucement: AnotherLevelUp fvwm configuration now works with FVWM 2.4 and
2.5. See http:www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU for details.

The process of upgrading AnotherLevelUp has revealed some `undocumented
features changes' in FVWM. I thought the FVWM developers may find it useful if
I report them here, each in a separate email.

Best wishes, John Latham

This is not actually an undocumented feature change, but it is understated!
:-)

Fvwm 2.2.4 man page says: ``Fvwm remains fully functional during a wait.''

Fvwm 2.4.8 man page says ``Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait.''

I spotted the one word difference after a few hours tracking down the cause of
a very strange behaviour. Presumeably, you have optimised away some threads
that had a memory/CPU overhead, and perhaps never imagined anybody would be
using Wait in a clever (=stupid!) way.

Alas, in AnotherLevelUp I was using Wait in a multi-threaded way, waiting for
an effect from a form which prompts the user to save his/her current
preferences, if they have been changed since last saved; when he/she asks for
a new set of preferences to be loaded. So we had a Wait active at the same
time as a form that needed user interaction. In 2.4 this does not work as all
the window events seem to be disabled during a Wait, all mouse clicks act on
the root window only.

It probably serves me right! I have rewritten it to work in a different, and
single threaded, way.

Is it worth writing some hints in the man page indicating what sort of things
do not work during a Wait -- or am I likely to be the only person daft enough
to try abusing Wait in this way? :-)

Best wishes, John Latham

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I had a bit of configuration that maximised an iconified window and then
de-iconified it. This stopped working in 2.4: the maximise was seeming to have
no effect. When I swapped the order round it works okay. I wanted to do the
maximise while the window was iconified so that there was less `flickering' on
the screen, but it is not a major issue.

While on this matter, can anyone suggest a better way of achieving the effect
I want? It is for the middle mouse button when clicked on the task bar window
buttons. If I move along the task bar pressing the middle mouse button on each
window button then I want to see each window in turn maximised, with all the
others returned to normal, and a second click on the last button returns that
window to normal too.

Viz:    Unmaximise the previous maximised window.
        Move to the desktop / page where this window is.
        Maximise / demaxmimise it, and focus it.

After much fiddling I previously arrived at:

*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Focus,Iconify 1,Prev [!FvwmTaskBar Maximized
!Iconic] Maximize 100 97,Maximize 100 97,Iconify -1,Focus

Since 2.4 I have had to swap the last Maximize and Iconify to make it work
again:

*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Focus,Iconify 1,Prev [!FvwmTaskBar Maximized
!Iconic] Maximize 100 97,Iconify -1,Maximize 100 97,Focus

With 2.4.6 (a la Red Hat 7.3 rpm) I got:

[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset fixed, trying 'fixed'

This was followed by some other font problems, e.g. the FvwmPager and
FvwmButtons. (And FvwmTaskBar...)

Red Hat have enabled multi-byte fonts in their 2.4.6 RPM, and I note such is
not a default compile option of 2.4. Is that the basis of the problem?

I wanted to get AnotherLevelUp to work okay with a standard Red Hat fvwm RPM,
so grepping for clues through old emails on this list I tried putting

        SetEnv LANG C
        SetEnv LC_CTYPE ""

early in the configuration. This seemed to get rid of some font problems,
although not the above error message presumeably because that occurs before
the SetEnv. (I could set LANG to C in the Xclients, etc, but it is not worth
it just to get rid of one benign error message, and I have a FVWM version
specific mechanism for the FVWM config commands in AnotherLevelUp, so the
SetEnv is put in only for 2.4.*.)

The same behaviour was exhibited in 2.4.8 (after I remembered to enable
multibyte).

It all works fine with 2.5.2, no need to alter locale. :-)

Would I be right in summarising that the 2.5 series has multi-byte fonts
sorted `properly', whereas they are still `dodgey' in 2.4 and hence they were
disabled by default; and Red Hat was `wrong' to enable them in their
distributed RPM? Or am I missing something?

FvwmTaskBar crashes, quietly without any trace, in 2.4.6 as shipped by Red Hat
7.3 (multi-byte is enabled) and also in 2.4.8 when compiled with multibyte
option, but not otherwise.

The task bar just refused to appear, and left no error message not even a core
dump. Don't ask me how I figured out this was with the setting that caused the
problem

        *FvwmTaskBarFont -*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

and changing it to the following makes it work okay:

        *FvwmTaskBarFont -*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

I assume it was picking up some font encoding that FvwmTaskBar cannot handle
-- does that make sense?

This behaviour was still happening after I changed to POSIX locale (see
previous message): it seems you need BOTH the posix locale and the iso8859-1
to make it work in 2.4, if multi-byte is emabled.

Similarly, FvwmPager was using the wrong font until I put the iso8859-1 spec
on that too. At least it wasn't crashing!

All this seems to work fine on 2.5.2, no need for locale change or iso8859-1
specification.

This all makes me think I could do with learning a *bit* more about X fonts
and their relationships to locales. Can anyone suggest a good (implies
short...) summary on the matter?

Fvwm2.2.4 (and previous) placed a single pixel width black box around the
internal window, just inside the border. This has disappeared by 2.4.6, and I
cannot find any reference to it in the man page. It's not a big issue, but it
does mean some combinations of window decorations look quite different to how
they used to -- particularly if the internal window has a similar colour to
the border. Could I suggest that you make it an optional BorderStyle? I
imagine the box may have disappeared when the new Raised/Flat/Sunk BorderStyle
flags apeared.

If menus are decorated with a horizontal gradient, then quite often some menu
items are left raised after the mouse pointer has scanned over them. In 2.4.8
they usually are flattened again after a short delay, although not always. In
2.4.6 they appear to be left raised for longer, but that could be just an
impression. The problem remains in 2.5.2.

An example MenuStyle is:

MenuStyle * mwm
MenuStyle * Font *helvetica*medium-r*12*
MenuStyle * Greyed grey35
MenuStyle * Foreground #FFFFFF
MenuStyle * MenuFace HGradient 128 2 #E50070 30 #1A80F0 70 #E50070

This is only a cosmetic problem, but it was not present in 2.2.4 and earlier.

After start up, the mouse pointer is always resting over an xterm in my set
up. Often, but not always, this xterm does not have the focus and I have to
move the pointer out of it and back in again. This also happens every time
after a restart when the mouse pointer is resting over a window. In 2.2 and
previous, the window under the mouse would always get the focus in both these
situations. I have tried this with sloppy and follow-mouse focus, on 2.4.6,
2.4.8 and 2.5.2.

Maybe the last window created (e.g. Pager or buttons) gets the focus instead
of the one under the mouse after the restart has finished?

A possible conection: if I PipeRead from FvwmTalk something which destroys and
creates windows (e.g. Pager, Buttons) then after the PipeRead in 2.2 FvwmTalk
still has the focus with sloppy and follows policy, whereas is loses it with
click focus (as you would expect). However, in 2.4 and 2.5 FvwmTalk has lost
the focus regardless of policy. (Of course, FvwmTalk has changed so this could
be a red herring).

Or, if I select a menu item, which does a PipeRead that causes a new window to
be started (e.g. xbiff), the new window ends up with the focus even though the
mouse is left where it was when it selected the (sub-sub) menu, say now over
an xterm. In 2.2 the xterm would now get the focus (this is with follow
mouse/sloppy focus of course).

I have some PipeReads which are executed via InitFunction and RestartFunction.
So, if PipeRead has changed its behaviour in this way, then that could be the
real cause of the start up / restart non-focus problem.

Bottom line: has something like a ``recheck focus policy and current mouse
position'' operation gone AWOL from the end of a PipeRead? :-) Perhaps
deliberately changed then -- is that really the best functionality? I would
suggest a good principle: with follows mouse/sloppy focus, if the mouse is
over a window that can take focus then that window has the focus -- at least
by the time Fvwm becomes `quiescent' again.

I have a certain application, written in Perl/Tk, which does not work properly
with 2.4.6 or 2.4.8; but did work okay with 2.2.4 and previous, and *does*
work okay with 2.5.2.

The problem: when a certain button is pressed in a Perl/Tk window:
        a text box is removed from the window
        then a new one is added
        then some text inserted into this new text box
        then the text box is removed
        then another new one is added
        then some text is inserted into this third text box
        then the size of the third text box is set

Out of context this sounds like a crazy thing to want, but trust me it is
sensible (the window is running a command for the user, first discarding the
old output, then showing standard error during the run, then standard output
after finishing, and resizing to suit the new output text right at the end).

This results in several window resizes, and on 2.4.6 and 2.4.8 the geometry
ends up wrong. Either it ends up being the smallest that was asked for (i.e.
without the text box) or correct in width but smallest in height! The resizes
can happen quite quickly, but I have tried adding in 2 seconds sleeps between
each stage, and it makes no difference. I could try to write a minimal example
program if that would help.

As I said it works okay again in 2.5.2, but I guessed it might be an unknown
bug that has been accidentally fixed, on the grounds that you would have
wanted to fix it in 2.4.8 too. True?

I have a function that used to work under 2.2, but does not under 2.4.8 nor
2.5.2. It is part of a window print capture form:

*CaptureButton      continue  "Capture" ^M
*CaptureCommand     CaptureCommand "$(file)" "$(Options)"

AddToFunc CaptureCommand
+ "I" Current [Capture] Iconify
+ "I" PipeRead "exec xwd -out \"$0\" $1"
+ "I" Prev [Capture] Iconify

A message from xwd complains that it cannot grab the mouse. It works fine if I
use an Exec instead of PipeRead, except for the obvious timing: I want the
Capture form to disappear while I grab the window image.

If there is a good reason for PipeRead being less liberal with X resources
than Exec is, would it be feasible to offer a version of Exec that does not
start a separate thread / process? Or, to offer a WaitExec command that waits
for the most recently started Exec?

I use PipeRead a lot as a `synchronised' Exec. I get the impression its
behaviour has changed fundamentally since 2.2, in what happens to everything
else during a PipeRead. I wonder if this is related to the change of behaviour
of the Wait command?

Say I press a FvwmButton button which pops up a menu, I select an item which
invokes a function including a PipeRead in it. While this PipeRead is running,
I click on another FvwmButton button.

In 2.2, after a delay, the menu associated with the second button pops up.

In 2.4.8, after a delay, the *root* menu pops up!

In 2.5.2 the press of the second FvwmButton button is ignored.

Personally, I prefer the 2.2 behaviour, but the 2.5 one is acceptable. What
2.4 does is quite frightening -- I have accidentally started all sorts of
options from the root menu!

I assume the 2.4.8 behaviour is a bug caused by some change since 2.2. Is the
2.5 behaviour deliberate (e.g. to plug the 2.4 bug)? Is the 2.2 behaviour
considered bad, or deliberately dumped on the altar of some better gain, or
just unintentionally lost?

Best wishes, John Latham

That's necessary to display the watch cursor while a function
executes.  Unfortunately we missed the implications about starting
applications that need to grab the mouse and forgot to mention it
in big bold letters in the NEWS and man page.

You mean "starts the process syncronously".  This has been
discussed a few times.  The solution is PipeRead again.  Try this:

  AddToFunc CaptureCommand
  + I BusyCursor read off
  + I Current (Capture) Iconify
  + I PipeRead "exec xwd -out \"$0\" $1"
  + I Prev (Capture) Iconify
  + I BusyCursor read on

After a bit of experimenting, I could reproduce the problem.  I'll

For me it works as usual, but it always was always a bit random.

I recommend to use FvwmConsole instead of FvwmTalk.

It was not reliable in 2.2.x and screwed up some more advanced
functions.  Therefore I rewrote the code keeping track of the
focus during function execution to be more reliable, at the cost
of some small changes in focus handling.

See above.  It's almost always easy to restore the focus with the
"Focus" command explicitly in your scripts.

It's not a bug, it's the watch cursor.  Again, disable it with

  BusyCursor Read off

before your PipeRead calls.  I'm sorry that it gives you so much
trouble.  The change in cursor shape was intended to give better
feedback that fvwm isn't accepting input at the moment.  We had
hoped that the watch cursor would be self explaining.

That hasn't changed.  I can only guess that the AnotherLevel

  BorderStyle -- !NoInset

Um, I don't see where this involves any resizing.

I can't say anything good about it without seeing the

Please do.

Sounds like a good candidate to be fixed in Tk.  Fvwm usually just
does what the application requests in exactly that order.  For
example, I have a similar problem with xemacs since 2.3.x, but
fvwm is really doing everything right.  Instead, xemacs chokes on
its own events.  It's timing dependent.

It's just a better description of what actually happens.  The Wait
command itself was not changed in any relevant way.

There is no multi threading in fvwm.

Event processing continues as usual.  The modules can receive and
send data to and from fvwm, but fvwm ignores all module input
until the wait finishes.  As this was the same in 2.2.x, I'm not
sure what was changed.  In general: Wait + using modules = bad.

Good idea.  TH Wait command is really just meant to wait for a
window that appears quickly.  Any other use is asking for trouble.
You can easily achieve the same benefits with FvwmEvent, but
without the bad side effects.

I'll add something.

You shouldn't use comma separated action lists anymore.  Each of
the commands might be applied to a different window, screwing up
the whole desktop.  It's safer to use a complex function.  Also,
the brackets around contitions are obsolete.  This is no problem
with the configuration, but should anyone ever look at this config
(s)he shouldn't be encouraged to use brackets.  Instead, use
parentheses.

Now to answer the question.  This setup should work more reliable:

  Style FvwmTaskBar WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip
  *FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Silent Function TB2Func

  SetEnv TB2FuncWin 0
  AddToFunc TB2Func
  + I WindowId $w (!maximized) TB2Activate
  + I WindowId $[TB2FuncWin] (maximized, !iconic) TB2Deactivate
  + I WindowId $w (!maximized, iconic) TB2Activate2
  + I SetEnv TB2FuncWin $w

  AddToFunc TB2Activate
  + I Iconify on

  AddToFunc TB2Activate2
  + I Focus
  + I Maximize on 100 97
  + I Iconify off

  AddToFunc TB2Deactivate
  + I Maximize off

The only problem is that this setup doesn't work well if you
iconify a window while it's maximized.

We already use the pod documentation format in FVWM in perl tools:

  * fvwm-menu-directory
  * fvwm-menu-headlines
  * fvwm-menu-xlock
  * fvwm-perllib
  * all perllib classes
  * FvwmPerl

I would probably say more yes than no to use pod in all documentation,
but I don't see a lot of reasons for this.
Pod is pretty rich, but not as rich as the man page format.
As for me, both the man page format and pod are easy to write and read.

There are a lot of small things in pod (say, no center-justification in
man pages) that I don't like, it is just not configurable enough. I myself
even have somewhere a patched Pod::Man that fixes some annoyances, like
converting "run fvwm(1)" to "run the fvwm manpage", but it's not an option
for everyone to install it. Also fvwm-perllib fixes one bug in pod2man.

There is no easy way to define a plain-unformatted-lines text without
first padding it with at least one space, this looks ugly in SYNOPSYS and
other places. This padding feature is often misused, for example the pod
used in Pod::Parser class itself hardcodes the 12 spaces indentation,
which is bad if the output is html, not just man pages.

Of course if I would not be a pod fan, I would not create fvwm-perllib
that uses it in several interesting ways.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hmm. But more than one active Wait is not an insane idea.

On this kind of topic: what about a FvwmButtons Swallow whose client
never appears? I'd imagine this is unrelated to FVWM itself and that the
module is simply monitoring a stream of events from FVWM, or does the
module get to preempty something off FVWM's event queue to do a swallow?

Why do I ask? I swallow a wmflame in my button, but not on a VNC desktop
(because it means constant VNC traffic, which I explcitly don't want).
Now, instead of being smart and using piperead to conditionally generate
the swallowing button, I always generate the button but conditionally
fire up the wmflame.

Is this likely to cause me trouble? It seems to work ok so far.

"Wait" works well only for windows that do appear do it fast.  Any

FvwmButtons just looks for a matching new window and otherwise
operates normally.  But there is one important differene.
FvwmButtons doesn't care when the window appears, but with the
"Wait" command you explicitly ask not to continue executing the
function that triggered it.  That is exactly what it is good for:
to not process any commands while the Wait is active.

    I noticed that there was a facility shipped with the standard xwindows
    distribution called "bitmap"  which seems to do what is wanted. ie
    set the hotspot.

bitmap creates xbm files, not xpm. Two xbms are needed to define a cursor
(in some other WMs) and only one xpm in FVWM, because 3 colors are used.

I think I will just add a small example of such xpm (from fvwm-themes) to
the man page. But then the FAQ entry is a bit redudant. :)

Hi,

I am using xplanet to update my background every couple of minutes. When
i quit fvwm, i would like to kill xplanet so that it doesn't keep on
running. A QuitFunction (called only when actually quitting) would be
convenient for this, but i can't seem to find it in the manual. Why is
this ?

thanks,
Remko

Yes, i saw the ExitFunction. But the man page says that this function is
called  on restarts  also. I only  want  to kill  xplanet when  actually
quitting.

Well, you may start xplanet in StartFunction instead of InitFunction
and ExitFunction will work for you like you want.

Or run an fvwm wrapper like this:

  xplanet &
  fvwm
  killall xplanet  # or: kill `pidof xplanet`

That's not really what you would want to do with xplanet.

This is indeed a solution, but i was wondering if it could be moved
inside fvwm. Is there a reason why there is no such QuitFunction ?

Noone just needed it, because other solutions exist. We would also need
PreRestartFunction for completeness. And SessionQuitFunction with
SessionPreRestartFunction. When I added StartFunction (to avoid a module
startup duplication) there were some voices saying too many special
functions is not very good. But if there are more people that can't live
without QuitFunction it may be trivially added.

It's a pure luxury problem.
When fvwm is restarted, xplanet doesn't have to be restarted because all
it does is update the background. Restarting it on every fvwm restart is
CPU intensive, and causes the background to blank out for a few seconds.

> Noone just needed it, because other solutions exist. We would also need
> PreRestartFunction for completeness.

I'm not saying that i _really_ need it, because as you said before, it 
can be moved out of fvwm inside a wrapper. But now that i read the
manual more thoroughly, i get your point on needing Pre-restart
functions. I had the impression that the functions were organized this
way (which they aren't):
    - InitFunction: called upon initialization only
    - QuitFunction (doesn't exist): called when the user quits only

    - StartFunction: called after InitFunction (when initing) or 
                            after RestartFunction (when restarting)
    - RestartFunction: called before QuitFunction (when quitting) or 
                              before StartFunction (when restarting)
My intuition behind this was that, things you want to do before a restart
(RestartFunction) and after a restart (StartFunction) , you also want
to do before quitting and after initing respectively. 

I hope this makes any sense to you at all ;)

cheers,
Remko

That's what i was planning to do. But for some strange reason, i
preferred to have it in my fvwmrc, and have as less as possible inside my 
.xinitrc. (i know, it's a purely subjective principle, but that's just my 
feeling :)

Anyway, i'll stick with the .xinitrc file.

My feeling too, .xinitrc is mostly for X settings. Apllications like
background painters are usually a part of a theme, may be different on
different X starts.

I know 2 reasons for StartFunction to be first and one reason for it to be
second.

>     - RestartFunction: called before QuitFunction (when quitting) or 
>                               before StartFunction (when restarting)

But then RestartFunction would be run twice.

Now when I think about this, I see an elegant solution for these problems.
We only need 2 functions (not including Session*Function variants),
StartFunction and ExitFunction.

StartFunction may include conditions "StartUp" and "Restart", ExitFunction
may include conditions "Restart" and "Quit", these conditions are always
false anywhere else. This way InitFunction and RestartFunction are not
needed (not that RestartFunction is needed now anyway).

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl
  + I On (StartUp) FvwmBanner
  + I On (Restart) Exec play /some/dong.au
  + I FvwmButtons
  + I Exec xterm ...
  + I Wait
  + I Exec mozilla
  + I On (StartUp) Exec xplanet-runner
  + I FvwmPager

  AddToFunc ExitFunction
  + I On (Quit) Exec killall xplanet-runner
  + I On (Restart) Exec play /some/ding.au
  + I Echo "Either Restart or Quit"

I don't know whether it is more intuitive or not.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Your approach is indeed cleaner and more general than what i had in mind.
Another advantage about this is that it's backward compatible.

Hi, all.

I have this in my InitFunction:

+ I Exec exec xterm -e ssh khan &

Is there any way I can make fvwm run a Maximize 0 100 on this xterm?

By the way, isn't there an "official" IRC channel where you guys hang
out? If not, #fvwm on OPN (irc.openprojects.net) might be a good
idea...

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

I have a function that accepts three arguments, the last of which is
optional; if omitted, I supply a default.  Here's what's working:

AddToFunc MyFunc
+ I PipeRead 'BD=$2; BD=${BD:-4};  ... '

If I try to shorten it to this:

+ I PipeRead 'BD=${2:-4};  ... '

then BD is always 4 ($2 is seemingly ignored).  "sh" is apparently
satisfied (no "bad substitution" error).  Expected?  Wrong syntax?

You can't shorten it. If you want the second function parameter to be
expanded by FVWM, you should write it as $2. Other shell-like syntaxes
like ${2} or ${2:-4} do not work, both these strings are passed to the
shell unexpanded if used inside PipeRead.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I hope someone else is also asking for direct draw fvwm.

As it is now, when I start X11 in a cygwin shell, the xwindow
comes up and the fvwm2 comes up.

However, when I quit the cygwin shell, the window manager goes
away and so do its child xterms.

It used to be that the X11 root when away but now it survives.
I hope an fvwm2 upgrade will enable the window manager to 
survive loss of the cygwin shell parent.

David

ps. Or, is there a workaround?

2 cents' worth from a new arrival who badly needs such a tutorial.

The postings (that I have read) look at suitable formats.

But the real issue is _content|sequence of presentation_.

My recent efforts to learn to use "vim" may serve as an illustration.

My version of Linux installed vim-5.7.  That did all that I am ever
likely to need in an editor.  But the documentation was unhelpful.  I
opted to update to vim-6.0 because it came with an Online Manual.

The Manual has two parts:

        a Users Manual; and
        a Reference Manual.

and it is utterly superb.

An enormous amount of thought and effort must have gone into the
preparation of the Users Manual in selecting the order in which topics
are described and previously-described routines are shown in use at
later stages - helping newcomers to refresh what they had learnt and had
already forgotten again.

This posting adds nothing that is not obvious to the experts - the requested
project is of mammoth proportions.

And if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.

Hi, all!
Now FVWM2 are up and running nicely, with the win95 look I'd asked for.
All what is left now is to edit setup to fit this installation, I'd
start on that soon. 

What I've done is to (removed the extra xpm installation) (1) re-build
xpm (NetBSD source package), as a result everything that depended on xpm
were re-built as well, so it took the entire evening (do not ask how
long, I'd went to bed). There have been a flaw in fvwm95 ( which is in
current use ), when I'd click on a window, it comes to front, but do not
receive focus. I'd have to click on the icon on button bar to gain
focus. When X is recently started it works ok, when I'd click on a
window, it gets to front and focus are gained, but after Netscape have
crashed once or more, I dont get focus by clicking in a window any more.
This behavior now seems to have disappeared, but I'd won't say its gone
quite yet, this bug is of an periodic kind, it's important to be very
patient. 

Furthermore I'd have tested the myfvwmtest program sent me from Mikhael
Goikhman, and I'd found that some libXpm.so.4 library were missing.
Links were made in /usr/lib, and after sucessful build, it reported 

XpmIncludeVersion=30411, XpmLibraryVersion=30411

as expected. Now, I'd (3) re-installed fvwm2:

./configure --with-xpm-library=/usr/X11R6/lib
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/X11R6/lib

.. this time config summary said "XPM  YES". Then I'd executed "make"
and "make install". It came up with that "configure 95" in main menu,
and soon I'd get that 95 look a like desktop. 

It seems like that xpm installation were bad. Some strange things also
happened to fvwm2, this may or may not be related to all the xpm
trouble, this time it found the setup 95 script, so the .fvwm2rc file
were installed. Happy ending, despite it is'nt very clear how the
scripts finally made it... Thank you very much all of you, and good luck
with the fvwm development. Feel free to ask more questions.

  it depends on how you start fvwm. some shells leave the kids running,
some kill them (it might be configurable). if you want the program to
run after you exit the shell regardles of which shell you are running
use nohup (see man nohup).

Hi

Anyone know where I can find toturials on writing FVWM modules? I'd like to 
write my own focus module. (A module that switches focus *and* raises windows 
following the mouse pointer)

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I haven't had the time to check out 
the site yet.

Thanks

I noticed that it is not possible to set a window to stay on top or bottom (ie 
floating/sinking) in FVWM.
I'm using 2.2.4. Should I upgrade or has it not been added?

Thanks

The module interface is documented at http://www.fvwm.org.
Pick "Developer Info (CVS, Modules)", then "Module Developer Info".

In the development branch, there have just been extensive changes
made to the focus code.

You must have missed it.

Fvwm used to implement this is styles like "StaysOnTop".
In more current releases, Fvwm uses the concept of layers.

See the developer documentation at fvwm.org.
If you use 2.5.2+ run "fvwm-perllib man" for documentation on creating
modules in perl.

I think you need FvwmAuto if you use SloppyFocus/MouseFocus.

Or if you use ClickToFocus and want an autoraising when clicking on a
window to gain a focus there are corresponding style options.

On the other hand writing a small focus module should be not harder than
10 lines of perl. Here is a small FvwmAuto replacement:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	use lib `fvwm-perllib dir`;
	use FVWM::Module;

	my $module = new FVWM::Module(Mask => M_FOCUS_CHANGE);
	$module->addHandler(M_FOCUS_CHANGE, sub {
		my ($self, $type, $winId) = @_;
		$self->send("Raise", $winId);
	});
	$module->eventLoop;

Hi,

I'm trying to make my taskbar icons work like Windows 98 and up.   The first 
click maximises the window and second click to minimize it.

How is this done?

Regards,
Stanley Yeoh

Hi,

When I maximise a window,  it gets maximised to the entire available 
dimension of my screen.   Hence covers up my taskbar as well.

How do I prevent it from covering my taskbar?

Someone should create a FAQ entry for this.

Instead of Maximize use "Maximize 100 -30p" where 30 is the width of
your FvwmTaskBar.

Or use EWMHBaseStrut in 2.5.x.

Mikhael.

Of course, using a small-footprint window manager like FVWM to
launch a Perl script is a bit like using a firecracker to set
off an H-bomb :)

Are you sure this is what Windows 98 does? Seems pretty crazy.
Or you mean the second click normalizes a window?
Anyway here is a 3 state window function:

  *FvwmTaskBar: Action Click1 MaximizeOrMinimizeOrNormalize

  DestroyFunc MaximizeOrMinimizeOrNormalize
  AddToFunc   MaximizeOrMinimizeOrNormalize
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized, !Iconic) Iconify on
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Maximize 100 -30p
  + I ThisWindow (!Maximized, Iconic) Iconify off
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized, Iconic) Maximize off

This is for 2.4.6+. There is another if-else solution for 2.5.x.
It is pretty tricky (but possible) to program if-else in 2.4.x.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Any FVWM module usually is event based and sleeps all the time.
An FVWM module written in perl may consume less memory then FvwmPager.

So I don't see your point. Probably I just don't understand a slang. :)

I think he means, first click deiconifies, second click iconifies.
Or maybe the right terms are deminimize and minimize, or map/unmap.

Point is, Perl is *huge* (last I heard).  If most of the size is
in the text segment, and some Perl process is already running, it's
possible that the incremental size of an additional process is not
all that big.

I don't know what "huge" means for you. Are xterm or rxvt huge?

Interesting that there are no shell processes in this list :)

Compared with other script interpreters, I would expect Perl to be
much larger than a Bourne shell, and probably larger than bash.
Perl used to be described as a "Swiss Army chainsaw" on the way to
becoming a "Swiss Army tactical nuke."

I don't have any Perl processes active, but here are some samples
of other stuff (on Red Hat 6.2/i686, FVWM 2.2.4).  Netscape is the
clear winner of the bloat award :)

It would be great if this information could go into the FAQ.  I switched to
WindowMaker for a while just to get my Java apps working reliably.  At least
with

  BugOpts ModalityIsEvil True

(described in another email in this thread) the Java windows seem to paint
properly.  I can live with the odd initial placements.  This is under Java
1.3, by the way.

What's the point in this discussion?  On the average system, the
shell and probably perl too are probably permanently in main
memory.  It's moot to discuss the size of the executable in memory
since it's there anyway.  What counts it the dynamic memory usage,
and that depends on what you do with perl/shell/whatever (and you
won't see it in "top").  memstat gives much better information
about dynamic memory usage.

It has the maximum height that fits on the screen.  If it were
even taller, the next text line or the window border would be
partially off screen.

Well, the last time I used windows, it worked like this:

clicking on a minimized (fvwm's 'iconic') window would deiconify and
raise it, clicking on a deiconified window that was lowered would raise
it, and clicking on a raised, deiconified window would iconify it.

HTH ;)

The point is to show that perl can't be called huge any more than bash or
rxvt or fvwm are called huge.

	Unfortunately, with Java 1.4, Sun changed the way Java misbehaves once again,
and ModalityIsEvil no longer works. You have to get one of the 2.5 development
versions of FVWM to work with Java 1.4.

	We have a new workaround in 2.5 that works with 1.4 - the FixedPPosition style.
You have to specify something like

Style MyJavaApp FixedPPosition

	A side note: for style matching, the old technique of specifying "Style AWTApp"
 for all Java apps won't work with 1.4. They changed it so that the (Java) Class
name is now used for the Class and Resource names; and it looks like the window
Name picks up the window title if you gave it one instead of just "VendorShell".
(Just so you know they did at least one Good Thing with this release.)


Cheers,
Bob

I don't want to be able to move/resize windows across the edge of the
screen. With this setup I can't move the cursor across the edge of the
screen but I can still partly move windows over the edge:

EdgeResistance 10000 0
EdgeScroll 0 0
EdgeThickness 0

What am I missing?

Uhm,

For instance you have a window opened (deiconified).   The first click at 
its taskbar icon iconifies the window.   The second click deiconifies it.   
The cycle resumes again with the third click iconifying and fourth 
deiconifying and so on...

Ok, then you need this line only:

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

I would like to be able to use a key binding to simulate clicking on
whichever TaskBar button is under the mouse cursor.  Unlike
FvwmButtons, FvwmTaskBar seems to ignore carriage returns.
Experiments with FakeClick proved fruitless.  Is there a way?

Perhaps "Return" or "Enter" could be added to the list of Action
qualifiers someday.

You still did not specify what to do when it is iconic, but I may guess.
The correct term of what you want is not "window on the topmost layer",
but "window is raised on its own (normal) layer". For 2.4.6+:

  *FvwmTaskBar: Action Click1 IconifyOrFocusAndRaise

  DestroyFunc IconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   IconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I DestroyFunc RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I AddToFunc   RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I ThisWindow ( Iconic)         + I Iconify off
  + I ThisWindow ( Iconic)         + I Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic  Raised) + I Iconify on
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic !Raised) + I Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic !Raised) + I Raise
  + I RealIconifyOrFocusAndRaise

In 2.5.x it may be done without tricks (the syntax may be changed):

  DestroyFunc IconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  AddToFunc   IconifyOrFocusAndRaise
  + I ThisWindow (Iconic) Iconify off
  + I Cond (NoMatch) ThisWindow (Raised) Iconify on
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic) Raise

You may configure any mouse and key action (with optional modifiers) in
FvwmIconMan in case you want to simulate FvwmTaskBar using FvwmIconMan
swallowed inside FvwmButtons.

I'm using a standard winblows comaptible keyboard, having mapped my two
windows keys using xmodmap with the following config

keycode 115 = Hyper_L
keycode 116 = Hyper_R
clear Mod4
add Mod4 =  0xFFED 0xFFEE

I'm using key combinations with the windows keys to do windowplacement,
desktopswitching and related stuff which works fine when I've just started
X. However after a random time these keybindings just stop working... I
can't find any regularity in the behavior of the keybindings, whenever
they stop, and I press e.g. windows + j , it prints a 'j' in my terminal
instead of switching windows.

Any clues on this one? fvwm (2.4.8) just doesn't seem to recognize those
keybindings after a while.

Probably your Num-Lock is pressed, see FAQ #0.1.

I have had this problem before...  Didn't take too long to figure out that
num lock was down, so I didn't feel too stupid, however it has happened to
me again lately and the num lock was not pressed.  I haven't been able to
put my finger on exactly what causes it, and when I try to intentionally
recreate the problem I can't seem to do it, but every once in a while I go
back to my terminal and discover that I can't drag windows around just
like the num lock was pressed.
The problem has occurred once when I left my terminal for a period of time
not greater than 5 minutes with a screen saver running, some applications
being xhosted from other machines, and a few local running applications.
It has occurred several times while I have screen locked and left the
machine running over the weekend, again with several xhosted applications
and just a handful of locally running programs.
In order to fix the problem I actually have to restart X, not just the
window manager.

The system is running redhat 7.3 on an intel something or other and
whatever version of fvwm2 that came with redhat.  The .fvwm2rc is my own
custom made file, not based on the one that came with redhat, but put
together from scratch.  Oh, and it's a dual monitor display system using
the xinerama extension on 2 monitors of the same size and resolution.  I
can't think of any other pertinent information, but if anyone has any
ideas as to what might be causing it I'd very much like to hear them.

The next time this happens, run xev and press any key or mouse button.
Normally "state" should be 0x0, but if some (unknown) modifier is pressed
"state" will be always different than zero (ignore non-zero value on mouse
releases). Report your results.

Mikhael.

I use Esetroot, though.  Similar.
Some of the FVWM screenshots on fvwm.org have the related rc files
available.

How about the scroll-lock and caps-lock keys?

Hi Dominik,

DV> > What is its replacement??
DV> It's still UseStyle.

Ah. Yes. I made a mistake and was slightly confused by the remark in
the manpage that "UseStyle" will dissapear in 3.0 (I'm using one of
the latest snapshots).
Sorry. Nevermind :-))

Then, I've something else (this problem made me think that "UseStyle"
wasn't working): it seems that when I order the BorderWidth
of some window to become "0", it can't be set something else, aftwerwards.

I've this piece of "code", for example:

AddToFunc ReturnToDesk
+               "I" Next [$0] MoveToDesk 0 $1
+               "I" Next [$0] Move +160p 4p
+               "I" Style $0 UseStyle "C64-blue", BorderWidth 0,
HandleWidth 0
+               "I" Next [$0] Layer 0 0
+               "I" UpdateStyles

AddToFunc GetBar
+               "I" Next [$0] MoveToDesk
+               "I" Next [$0] Move m-5 m-10
+               "I" Style $0 UseStyle "C64-black", BorderWidth 1,
HandleWidth 1
+               "I" Next [$0] Layer 0 6
+               "I" UpdateStyles

"GetBar" gets a window ($0), repositions it at my mousecursor and adjusts
the style (and border-/handlewidth). When calling a window with border-
and handlewidth >0, it works. When calling a window with both widths set
to "0", these widths aren't set to "1".

It used to work, but since, ehmm, "I don't know", it stopped doing what
it is supposed to do.

"Help" :)

I see.  Once the border width is set to zero, you are stuck with
it.  I'll fix that.

Hi,

I'm modifying from fvwm95 script.   The window title shrinks when I use a 
smaller window title font.   Making a mess out of the min/max/close icon 
buttons.

How do I make my window title bar's height fixed to a specified size 
permanently?   I don't want it to follow my font size's height.

Regards,
Stanley Yeoh

Hi,

I've just installed X4.0.2, XMMS and Mozilla on top of a base LFS system.  
I'm annoyed by the huge font sizes that are seen on Mozilla's title bar, 
status bar, bookmarks, preferences window and file dialog window.   Also 
XMMS's preferences and file dialogs windows has such huge fonts.

I'm not sure if its fvwm or those apps itself which are causing this.   
Where should I look into for fixes?

Regards,
Stanley Yeoh

Hi

A humble suggestion for pager:

I use pager when working with pictures as one large virtual desktop, that I 
scroll around. As I use very large windows, it is useless to only have 
window names in the pager window. It would be a nice feature to have, 
besides window name, a rough bitmap of window content in the small pager 
window windows.

Regards,
Tatu

FVWM only handles fonts used in its menus, window/icon titles, modules.

Try to play with font path in your X or xfs configuration or install
better fonts or configure better fonts in applications.

Does "Raised" mean the window is not iconified _and_ has focus _and_ is not
partially or fully obscured by other windows?  The man page ("Current" command)
is silent about this condition.

No, Raised only means not obscured by other windows. There may be several
such windows on the desktop. It's irrelative of iconic or focused.

Most of icons (if they are not obscured) would match the Raised condition.
So if there are normal icons (as opposed to NoIcon) a window may be in
2x2x2 = 8 states regarding the Iconic, Raised and Focused conditions. If
NoIcon is used, I think, Raised is always true when Iconic, so there are
6 states.

> The man page ("Current" command) is silent about this condition.

Yup.

Mikhael.

Hello,

I was having a discussion with a mate about our respective choices of 
window manager and it occurred to me that I know very little about where 
FVWM came from..

Who started it? When? What was it based on? I'd find info on this sort 
of thing quite interesting if anyone knows anything about it.

Perhaps it'd be worthy of a page on the FVWM website too?

Cheers,

--
Andy

The guy who started it was Rob Nation.
The earliest mentioning I could find on usenet dates to July of 1993.
The code was (as far as I know) based on twm.
It was designed to mimic mwm (Motif's WM), (but actually IMHO the default
window border handles look a bit like IRIX's 4dwm).

I'm afrai, but that feature cannot be written in X in a fashion
that would be actually usable.  When a window is not currently
visible, its contents may not be anywhere in memory, so the pager
cannot find out what to draw in the mini window.  And even if the
window is on screen, this would need ridiculous amounts of memory 
and take so long to update that nobody would use it.  I'm sorry to
say this, but X simply doesn't provide an interface for background
drawing.

((Chuck, are you still lurking?  Can you fill in the gaps before
1998?))

Robert Nation started it back in 1993.  The first time anything
was heard about it in public was on the 1st of July in 1993, when
Rob bundled a development version (0.5.something) with an rxvt
release (a still popular terminal program).  In the next few
months, fvwm became an independent package and fvwm-1.0 was
released in fall, still 1993.  Originally, the "F" in fvwm stood
for "feeble".  But then, Rob seems to have forgotten this at some
point in time and thus the famouse FAQ question 1.1 was born.  But
although there is strong evidence on the meaning of the "F" in old
new group archives, we nowadays prefer the "mysterious F"
interpretation ;-)

I know litte about what happened between 1993 and 1996.  Rob
stopped to maintain fvwm and Charles Hines took over the project
for several years(?).  When Chuck resigned, Brady Montz became
the new maintainer for a couple of months, I believe in late 1997
or early 1998.  Anyway, it took almost 8 month between the 2.0.45
release (22nd of January, 1997) and 2.0.46 (20th of August, 1997).
I can only guess why, but probably this was a foresign of Chuck's
approaching retirement.  At this time I had been using fvwm-2.0.x
for about two years at home and wanted to implement some of the
features I liked in CDE to fvwm.  In December 1997 I sent Brady my
patches and never got an answer.  I tried again half a year later,
and contacted the mailing list, but fvwm development was as dead
as it could be.

Then - I believe it was in September or October (I have to look
this up in the mailing list archive) - Brady resigned and
everybody on the mailing list thought this would finally be the
end of fvwm development.  Seeing this and not willing to give up
fvwm this easily, I took over the job as fvwm maintainer for the
moment.  After a lot of discussion we agreed that we should try to
make a first stable release in the 2.x series as soon as possible.
With a grat team effort we were able to resolve the most pressing
issues and managed to get the stable 2.2.0 release out the door
in February 1999.  (I want to thank all the people who helped to
make it possible back then).

My memory of the sequence of events is a bit foggy.  Some time in
late 1998 or early 1999 we decided that having a single maintainer
as the master over the code wasn't such a hot idea.  In the past,
people had been eager to work on fvwm but had been hindered by the
maintainer, or more precisely:  by the absence of a maintainer.
As a result, almost no work had been done in fvwm for over one and
a half years.  So I gave up my role as the maintainer and the
responsibilities were since taken over by the people on the
fvwm-workers list.  Unfortunatly I'm still stuck with most of the
project organizing work.

Anyway, since that day in October 1998 when a complete X newbie
couldn't keep his mouth shut fvwm development is as active as it
will ever be.  Some of the people that helped to make 2.2 possible
left and some became less active, but we still have an excellent
team here (with a weakness in writing documentation).  Although
I'd rather not single out anyone, I have to mention Olivier
Chapuis and Mikhael Goikhman who are doing an excellent job in
providing some framework (configure, fvwm-themes,
internationalization, not to mention all the nifty features in the
fvwm core they have written).  Although at times it might appear
as if I am the one that keeps fvwm alive, fvwm wouldn't be half as
good without the help of the many people on the mailing lists, be
it by writing bug reports, complaining about missing features,
answering questions of other users or simply encouraging us to
continue our work.

What about the future?  Well, the work for the next stable series
(2.6.x) is proceeding very well.  Fvwm will go into feature freeze
again near the end of the year so that 2.6 is ready before fvwm's
tenth birthday on 1st of Junly, 2003.  I have vague plans for a
big event on that day to remind people that fvwm is still there
and that it can easily compete with any other window manager.
After that there are plans for a version 3.0 that would change a
lot of the syntax and introduce fantastic new features, but that's
too far from now.

> Perhaps it'd be worthy of a page on the FVWM website too?

That is definitely going to be done for fvwm's birthday.

	Great idea. I hope Chuck can fill in a bit of detail on the 1995-1998 period
(woud that be the Carolingian era?)

	On Google I found an interesting link to a Linux Journal interview with Rob
circa 1997. 

		http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=2164

At that time he appears to have recanted his absent-mindness and reverted to his
earlier position that the "F" stood for Feeble, because the earliest release was
just that: it didn't do much. It seems to have gotten better very quickly.


Cheers,
Bob

I think E (or Evolution? I forget) has such a pager.
You could probably snapshot things on desktop switches, while they're
visible. It would mean the thumbnails weren't "live", but it would work
pretty well. It would be rather expensive - E has never been put off by such
things :-) Needless to say I prefer FVWM.

  yes, enlightenment

  I just started E and it seems to be updated with small delay
(seconds), quite impressive. Another nice (as in good looking, not sure
how useful it is) feature is the zooming of the window in pager when the
mouse is over it.

I guess you would have to ave the conent of a page when switching pages
and use that as the representation, so that only the current page is more
"live"

And the current page would be updated with some interval, but the question
is. But doing screenshots using imort is quite time consuming, so maybe
another aproach is needed, like only updateing some of the windows each
time...

I just realised Style * MouseFocusClickRaises doesn't work for me.
Windows are only raised when I click the title bar.
I have sloppy focus set. I use fvwm 2.5.2, is this a bug (known) or is it
my config that is broken somewhere?

I also tried to set Style * ClickToFocusRaises and Style * ClickToFocus
But windows are still only raised when clicking on the title bar.

In both cases, windows receive focus as expected.

Actually all key-bindings stopped working too (and yes, I tried pressing
num-lock again too see if it was the problem), after a log out and in
again the problem was gone, perhaps some problem with XFree86...

The Gnome 1.x pager does incremental "screenshot" line by line at a small
delay between each screen line..

Hi,
sorry for this simple question... but I can't figure that out:

I defined a Menu to start an xterm like this:

AddToMenu MenuBackup
+	"start backup"		Exec exec xterm

But how can I add something (after Exec exec xterm) to start a
scipt which shows its output in that xterm?

Bye
 Felix

Hi,

I would like to make changes to Start Menu's font as well as the Start 
button's font.   Where should I edit?

And I would like to modify my windows title's font too.

Regards,
Stanley Yeoh

AddToMenu MenuBackup

works fine for me in 2.4.8 (and did in 2.2.2 too).

Hi !

I have a doubt from the man page:

              GrabFocus causes a newly  mapped  window  to
              grab  the  focus,  while  GrabFocusOff turns
              this off.   GrabFocus  is  the  default  for
              ClickToFocus windows and GrabFocusOff is the
              default for MouseFocus and SloppyFocus  win=AD
              dows.   Note  that  this  option is switched
              back to the default every  time  you  change
              the  focus policy.  You have to use it after
              the initial  ClickToFocus/MouseFocus/Sloppy=AD
              Focus.

to me (non native English) this means that if I issue:

Style * ClickToFocus

than I automatically get GrabFocus for free. But experimentally this is=20
not true (new windows are not raised/don't get focus).

Everything is fine if I issue:

Style * ClickToFocus, GrabFocus

but GrabFocus should be the default with ClickToFocus, or not ?

I don't know if the problem is in the code, in the man page, or in my=20
poor understanding of what it says ....

Thanks a lot !

cheers,
Giuseppe.

If your script immediatelly exits after printing the output you should
prevent xterm from being closed, something like:

  Exec exec xterm -e sh -c "date; head -1"

where "date" is your script. This waits for Enter to be closed.

You may learn about defining fonts in the fvwm and FvwmTaskBar man pages.
Find a good font using xfontsel or gfontsel and add it to configuration.

If you use the Script 95 configuration that you mentioned in another
message, the actual lines are in the files ~/.fvwm/decorations and
~/.fvwm/modules.

  Style * Font "-*-times-medium-r-*-*-14-*"
  *FvwmTaskBar: Font -adobe-times-medium-r-*-*-12-*
  *FvwmTaskBar: SelFont -adobe-times-bold-r-*-*-12-*

Mikhael.

Interesting; I would have done 'read' instead of 'head -1' ;)

head is more portable, read is not available in some shells like tcsh/csh.

Me too. Doesn't even fork an extra process.

| head is more portable, read is not available in some shells like tcsh/csh.

Speaking as one who predates "head" I'd had differed on this:-) (Well, at the
least started on systems that predated "head").

True, [t]csh users can't use read. But Bourne shell users can, and should.

While we're picking nits, if one must read for an extra command, "sed q" is
even shorter. I have never liked "head" myself; "tail" I understand - it's
hard to do otherwise. But a simple:
	sed 12q
is the same as
	head -12
and shorter and easier to type. And sed definitely predates head.

Hello fvwm-users,

I installed fvwm-2.5.2 and I want to use xft2 from the 
fcpackage-02.07.28-something.tar.gz.
Maybe I didn't install the fcpackage right, but the header file which 
declares FcBool is found in /usr/X11R6/include/fontconfig/fontconfig.h.

Which steps do I need to take to compile fvwm-2.5.2 with xft2 support?

Looking forward to improve my knowledge!
Wilbert van Bakel

Continuing this useless discussion. If you don't want your script to fork,
use perl and <> to read a line, or use $< in tcsh, or use a portable
solution that is not language specific like using head/sed. Some unices
have utility called line that does just what "head -1" does.

Funny, the following is incorrect in bash and ksh:

  % xterm &; xterm

But this is correct in tcsh, zsh, ash and csh. If you put a command
with & in parentheses it should work in all shells:

  Exec (xterm &); (xterm &); (xterm &)

On the other hand, if you need a sequence, you don't need parentheses:

  Exec xterm; xterm; xterm

	Was it just the key-binding problem that was gone, or did the problem with
MouseFocusClickRaises/ClickToFocusRaises problem  disappear also?

config.log contains a reason why xft2 was not detected.

Try to specify:

  ./configure --with-freetype-prefix=/usr/X11R6

(or --with-freetype-exec-prefix=/usr/X11R6), this sets a prefix of your
fontconfig-config script, i.e. /usr/X11R6/bin/fontconfig-config .

Mikhael.

I found font-config-config in /usr/bin and used --with-freetype-prefix=/usr.

I hope I did paste the right part of the config.log:

You forgot to say that you use the cvs version.

I can reproduce this problem, i.e. ClickToFocus does not set GrabFocus,
although I see in the code it does set.

There is a more serious problem. With SloppyFocus/MouseFocus, GrabFocus
only works now when the pointer is on the root and not in the window.

It turns out fcpackage didnt/doesnt install the xft2 headers.

In RedHat it is done this way. The headers are installed in
/usr/include/Xft2, i.e. /usr/include/Xft2/X11/Xft/Xft.h and
"xft-config --cflags" returns -I/usr/include/Xft2 among others.

So there are no conflicts with Xft1 in /usr/include/X11/Xft/Xft.h.

Mikhael.

   Yeah. I've seen the above "% xterm &; xterm" fail a million
   times and never learn because it doesn't make any sense to
   me. I think its a bug. Heres a line from a script where I use
   the semi-colon which works just fine:

       cd /usr/src; rm -rf $GCC; tar -zxvf $GCC.tar.gz;

   I guess the & confuses it. Somebody should send a report
   to bug-bash@gnu.org to get clarifition. ( not me. I already
   got a bug report pending) I quickly tried this

       set -o monitor   # enable jobs
       set -b           # enable immediate reporting of SIGCHLD
       xterm &; xterm

    to enable job control and it still doesn't like it.


   Anyway the second form "Exec (xterm &); (xterm &); (xterm &)"
   does the trick. Sometimes something is funny is happening on
   the net like somebody trying to use your machine as a relay
   when they have no business doing so and I want to fire up a
   whole bunch of tails on the logs really quick. Now I can do it.

Nice. Thanks for the tip!
For non-redhat people,configuring xft2 with the following does the trick:
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr --includedir=/usr/include/Xft2

No, the semicolon confuses it. Try this:

	; echo foo

Works in zsh. Fails in bash:

	[cameron@amadeus cameron]$ ; echo foo
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;'

Their language syntax just doesn't cope with a semicolon at the start of a
command. Which is sad. 

All Bourne shells (bash, zsh etc) should cope with this:

	xterm & xterm & xterm &

because & terminates a command, so you need no separator before the next
xterm. Works in csh too.

For your amusement, bash doesn't cope with this either:

	< foo ( command )

which _ought_ to be the same as this:

	( command ) < foo

because redirections are supposed to be permitted anywhere.

Cheers,

In bash, the syntax you are looking for is simply 'xterm & xterm'.

You are right,

I copied the header files into /usr/X11R6/include/Xft and now configure 
recognizes xft2.
Would it be okay to replace xft1 by xft2, since I practically want to 
build the whole system based on the new xft?

Thank you,
Wilbert van Bakel

I dont think you should do that, because some programs can't use xft2 yet.
If you configure xft2 with:
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr --includedir=/usr/include/Xft2
or mbey
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --includedir=/usr/X11R6/include/Xft2
your system will be able to use xft1 or 2 depending on which one is needed.

      Along these lines how would some one start multiple applications?
      Consider:

AddToMenu Tails         "Tails    " Title
+ "Messages" exec xterm -fn 7x13bold -T \
       messages -fg white -bg black -j -rw -aw +sf -sl 200 -sb -e \
       tail -f /var/log/messages

      I have 5 or 6 tails that I bring up and sometimes I would like
      to bring up different groups of them. I tried

+ "All" Exec exec xterm  -fn 7x13bold -T \
                  Messages -fg white -bg black -j -rw -aw +sf -sl 200 -sb -e \
                       tail -f /var/log/messages &; \
                  xterm  -fn 7x13bold -T \
                     Syslog -fg white -bg black -j -rw -aw +sf -sl 200 -sb -e \
                        tail -f /var/log/syslog  &
   I thought the ';' would work.


   By the way I have a very unusual problem with fvwm-2.5.2. It just
   occurred while I was writing this email. And its this kind of problem.
   Intermittent, (i.e. occurs every couple of days.) It seem to occur under
   heavy load, and perhaps is connected with a large amount of output to an
   xterm. What happens is that the output to the xterm freezes, until I bring
   the mouse into the xterm (FocusFollowsMouse) then every everything is back
   to normal. This time was unusual because I happened to have 'top' running.
   The processors were about 75% usage (say), the output stopped in an xterm
   and the processors wentt o to 100.0% idle,  (I was doing a series of builds)
   I typed this letter for a while and finally moved the mouse into the xterm.
   The builds started up again and the processors went back to 75% usage again.
   What I didn't do, I'm sorry to say was type 'ps x' to see what it said.
   I know that fvwm-2.5.2 is development, but I need to use it because it
   fixes some serious problems that occurred with an upgrade to xwindows 4.2
   fvwm-2.5.2 seems to work fine anyway. I haven't been on the site for
   a while to see what the latest is.

Here you should remove "exec":

  Exec xterm &; xterm &; xterm &

The last & is optional, but I would leave it for symmetry.

If you use shell controls like ";", "&", "()", "|", where a shell should
spawn additional processes, you should do this in "Exec" not "Exec exec".

Another solutions to your problem are: instead of writting several shell
commands in one line, create a small shell script and call it, or create
a function with multiple "Exec exec" commands.

Try to narrow the problem and make it reproducible, so that others can see
this too.

   doesn't work. Nothing happens. If I remove the last xterm then an
   xterm pops up as expected, as in

   + "All" Exec xterm &

   but if I add a semicolon

   + "All" Exec xterm &;

   then nothing happens

   Tricky, only thing I can think of is 'ps x' to see if the process's
   are stopped. It seems that as long as I don't move into the mouse
   into the window it stay in that state. All other windows are functional.
   The question is what to examine. Suggestions are welcome.

Hi there,

I  was pretty suprised to see that fvwm-2.5.2 can make  pinable  menus.
(http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/download/fvwm_pinable_menu.jpg).
I achieved this by pressing mouse button 2 on the title of the menu.  I
tried  it with fvwm-2.4.3 without success. I had a look at the man and
the web page but could not find any mention about this feature.

Since which version is that supported? Or is it probably a usefull bug?

Regards, Uwe

You can also press backspace.

It isn't supported yet.  Tear off menus are still under
development.  Interface needs some polishing and there is no
documentation.

Not really it was way too complex to happen just by accident ;-)

Ah yes.  I wasn't aware of the old behaviour and changed it.
What should it do?  Reset GrabFocus or leave it as it was?

It now only sets the default.  Once GrabFocus or GrabFocusOff is
used, the default is ignored.

I see no such problem.  Can you narrow down the config to make
this happen?

well, I don't know ....

you should either revert to the old behaviour or change the man page

I'm used to the old behaviour (I immediately added GrabFocus to my Style !)
and I think that probably many people using ClickToFocus are, so ...

half a vote for the old behaviour ;-)

I am still lurking, yes, but not sure how much I can fill in as my memory is
getting a little fuzzy in my old age...I'll see what I can do... :)

I apologize for leaving all of the cited text in here.  I normally would trim
out most of it but for filling in a history it seemed appropriate to leave it
in.

DV> although there is strong evidence on the meaning of the "F" in old

DV> interpretation ;-)

I never agreed with "feeble" myself, even early on.  That was one of the
reasons I came up with that list in the FAQ, to provide alternate
possibilities, hopefully mostly positive.  Many of them were suggested in
emails on the mailing list, if I remember correctly.  Of course, I added the
explicitives to that list because they were what I most often used while
trying to figure out bugs. :)

DV> I know litte about what happened between 1993 and 1996.  Rob

DV> I can only guess why, but probably this was a foresign of Chuck's

DV> as it could be.

I believe that I maintained fvwm from Aug 95 through May of 98.

I had been using it actively from an early point (probably right around the
1.0 version, but I can't be sure, I have some saved emails about fvwm from
early in 1994 and I know I had been using it for a while before then).  I was
working at IBM and the machines we had at the time while fairly powerful were
still brought to their virtual knees by mwm, so I believe I searched USENET
(comp.windows.x.apps) for a good replacement.  Found fvwm and never looked
back... :)

I kept a close eye on fvwm after discovering it (I believe there was a mailing
list at "fvwm@shrug.org", and stuff on comp.windows.x.apps of course).  I
contributed a couple of minor patches to fvwm in those earlier days, like to
get it to compile nicely under AIX and some stuff with colormap behavior (I'm
so happy to not have an 8bit display any more).  By the way, if anyone has (or
can track down) any archives of that earlier mailing list, it'd probably be
pretty cool to resurrect them...

Then one day Rob had sent out a message (on the mailing list, I believe) that
stated something to the effect that he didn't want to work on fvwm any more,
and was looking for someone else to maintain it.  I wanted to offer to take it
over (as an X11 learning experience - I had dealt with X at the toolkits level
but was curious about the more low level stuff) but didn't feel I had the time
to properly devote to it so I didn't say anything at first.

Then after about 2 weeks of watching people say "I'd love to, but I can't
program" I figured I'd better make that offer after all, qualifying it with
something like "I don't know if I have time to do this right, but I'm willing
to make an attempt".  Rob remembered my previous contributions and figured I'd
be able to make a go at it, so he turned it over to me.  That was version
"pre-2.0-patchlevel-33" if I remember correctly.

Then I worked on it sporadically over the next couple of years.  At first I
wasn't too bad about getting releases out, but the length of time between each
one got longer as "real life" invaded.  Another part of the problem was
because I did use it as a learning experience, I would often rewrite patches
that were submitted to me so I really understood what was happening and with
an eye towards making things "easier" in the future (which I'm sure pissed off
a couple of people, but at the time I thought I had good reasons for doing
things that way).

Finially I had to admit that I just didn't have the time to properly devote to
it any more.  So it May of 1998 (I believe) I sent some email privately to
Brady Montz, as I felt that the stuff he contributed showed him to have the
most promise for taking it over at the time, and he (reluctantly?) agreed to
give it a shot.

And you know the rest of the story from there...  I wish I could have done
(and learned) more, but I'm happy to have done my part.

DV> Then - I believe it was in September or October (I have to look

DV> as the master over the code wasn't such a hot idea.  In the past,
DV> people had been eager to work on fvwm but had been hindered by the
DV> maintainer, or more precisely:  by the absence of a maintainer.
DV> As a result, almost no work had been done in fvwm for over one and
DV> a half years.  So I gave up my role as the maintainer and the
DV> responsibilities were since taken over by the people on the
DV> fvwm-workers list.  Unfortunatly I'm still stuck with most of the
DV> project organizing work.

I have to admit that at the time I didn't think the "rule by committee" stuff
was going to work with fvwm, but all in all it seems to have worked out pretty
well.  I think that a lot of that has to do with the fact that you were there
to steer it's course.  Having some other pretty sharp individuals contributing
helps too, of course. :)

DV> Anyway, since that day in October 1998 when a complete X newbie
DV> couldn't keep his mouth shut fvwm development is as active as it
DV> will ever be.  Some of the people that helped to make 2.2 possible
DV> left and some became less active, but we still have an excellent
DV> team here (with a weakness in writing documentation).  Although
DV> I'd rather not single out anyone, I have to mention Olivier
DV> Chapuis and Mikhael Goikhman who are doing an excellent job in
DV> providing some framework (configure, fvwm-themes,
DV> internationalization, not to mention all the nifty features in the
DV> fvwm core they have written).  Although at times it might appear
DV> as if I am the one that keeps fvwm alive, fvwm wouldn't be half as
DV> good without the help of the many people on the mailing lists, be
DV> it by writing bug reports, complaining about missing features,
DV> answering questions of other users or simply encouraging us to
DV> continue our work.

DV> What about the future?  Well, the work for the next stable series
DV> (2.6.x) is proceeding very well.  Fvwm will go into feature freeze
DV> again near the end of the year so that 2.6 is ready before fvwm's
DV> tenth birthday on 1st of Junly, 2003.  I have vague plans for a
DV> big event on that day to remind people that fvwm is still there
DV> and that it can easily compete with any other window manager.
DV> After that there are plans for a version 3.0 that would change a
DV> lot of the syntax and introduce fantastic new features, but that's
DV> too far from now.

Ah the future...scary and exciting... :)

>> Perhaps it'd be worthy of a page on the FVWM website too?

DV> That is definitely going to be done for fvwm's birthday.

Cool.

Hope my feedback helped fill in some more of the blanks.

Later,
Chuck

It helped a lot indeed!  Thanks, Chuck.  Well, maybe you (or
anybody else) can help out with something else:  how can I contact
Rob?  There's almost no information about him on the web, other
than the various references in the man pages.  The fvwm birthday
just *can't* go by without a word from him.  (Please reply to me
personally, we should respect Rob's privacy and not post personal
data on the web).

BTW, the first fvwm release was on 1st of June 1993, not July as I
wrote before.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi Dominik,

I've just updated to CVS, and I've found your fix:

        * fvwm/style.c (merge_styles):
        fixed style defaults getting stuck to on once set

it works fine, thanks !! 

But now, I see again the problem I described in the thread "The "great 
focus policy rewrite"", i.e. while clicking in the middle of a window, the 
window itself is focussed but not raised any more.

As in that thread, 'FvwmAuto 0' is a possible workaround.

Thanks a lot !!

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi, all.

I have a little problem and some help would be very appriciated... :-)
I'm starting xbuffy in InitFunction:

+ I Exec exec xbuffy -geometry x-0+270 -bg black -fg white -fn 5x7
-boxfile $HOME/.xbuffyrc -fill &

What should I set x to if I want it to be all the way down to the buttom
of the screen except for the last 133 pixels? Maybe that can't be done,
or?

Regards, Johan Svedberg

If I understand your question right, wouldn't the answer be

+ I Exec exec xbuffy -geometry -133+270 -bg black -fg white -fn 5x7
-boxfile $HOME/.xbuffyrc -fill &

?

  -133 (it's y)

  see man X for more info on geometry options.

Didn't we just go through this on another thread? The syntax you are
looking for is this:

Hi,

i'm new to fvwm and like it a lot 

however, i was somewhat puzzled by the way "Maximization" works:
wanted to define some hotkeys to maximize/grow windows
horizontally/verticaly or even left/right/up/down
and by combining these actions to get the best size and location
(very often i end up with hundreds of windows open and then try to 
get the "best" out of them  ;-)

these combinations however do not work: the window switches
back to it's 'normal' size after the second hotkey and only
after repeating it, does it do the sec type of maximization
(and of course only that one this time)
so obviously, any of these actions is considered as a Maximization 
and any following action of the same type will be taken as a request 
to Unmaximize the window (toggle).

of course, one could use "True" to force the maximizations
but then the unmaximization "toggle" will not work with the 
same hotkey


if there is already the possibility to do vert. and hor.
maximizations separately, wouldn't it be nicer/more logical
to also handle them separately (ie. assign two booleans instead of 
one single)?

best

imre

There is only one maximized geometry and one maximized state for every
window, you may switch from one maximized state to another one without
switching to the unmaximized one, but it seems you already know this.

  AddToFunc MaximizeVerticallyOrUnmaximize
  + I Maximize toggle 0 100

  AddToFunc MaximizeHorizontallyOrUnmaximize
  + I Maximize toggle 100 0

Or:

  AddToFunc UnconditionallyMaximizeVertically
  + I Maximize false  # this line is optional, changes the result a bit
  + I Maximize true 0 100

  AddToFunc UnconditionallyMaximizeHorizontally
  + I Maximize false  # this line is optional, changes the result a bit
  + I Maximize true 100 0

Or if you need 2 (or more) maximized states while still only having one
maximized geometry, 2.5.x has a solution: user definable window states.

  DestroyFunc MaximizeVerticallyIfNotAlreadyOrUnmaximize
  AddToFunc   MaximizeVerticallyIfNotAlreadyOrUnmaximize
  + I ThisWindow (State 30) Maximize false
  + I Cond (Match)          State 30 false
  + I Cond (Match)          State 31 false
  + I Cond (NoMatch) Maximize true 0 100
  + I Cond (NoMatch) State 30 true

  DestroyFunc MaximizeHorizontallyIfNotAlreadyOrUnmaximize
  AddToFunc   MaximizeHorizontallyIfNotAlreadyOrUnmaximize
  + I ThisWindow (State 31) Maximize false
  + I Cond (Match)          State 30 false
  + I Cond (Match)          State 31 false
  + I Cond (NoMatch) Maximize true 100 0
  + I Cond (NoMatch) State 31 true

  DestroyFunc OriginalMaximize
  AddToFunc   OriginalMaximize
  + I State 30 false
  + I State 31 false
  + I Maximize $*

This is an example, but you should get an idea. Note that the condition
ThisWindow (Maximized, !State 30, !State 31) should mean that a window was
maximized using OriginalMaximize and not using the first 2 functions.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hmm. Do you really want a toggle.

I know I've tried Maximise in the past, but never really want it.
(For example, various things (resizish things) don't seem to work on
maximised windows, because they're maximised!)

I now _only_ use Resize (and ResizeMove(sp?)).

I have key bindings to basicly do:
	- resize 100 90	 (top 10% of screen has tools in it for me)
	- resize to any quadrant
	- resize to left or right half of screen
	- lower/raise stuff

For me at least, the notion of "maximise" as a state doesn't map to how
I work; I want "put a window over there, that size", and when I'm done
with it I close it or iconify it.

I'm curious: how many people really use "maximise" as a state toggle?

One of my messages was moderated, because it had 4 recipients listed (good
to know). It took a day for everyone to get it, but 3 other recipients got
it immediatelly, so we continued the discussion without waiting for the
parent message to appear on the list.

The messages from the list have a special signature. You may disable
duplicated emails if this helps (man procmailex).

I use it all the time, mostly maximize a window fully, vertically,
horizontally, unmaximize. I myself don't use grow, because it is too
unpredictable.

Try ResizeMaximize or ResizeMoveMaximize (Mouse 1  SF  S  ResizeMaximize),
you may like it. Now not only it will do what you describe, but you will
be also able to restore the original geometry when you are done in
addition to just "close it or iconify it".

Mikhael.

Sorry, I was being a bit impatient. Mikhail (sp? sorry) explained that
due to moderation, messages arrive out of order. No other list I know is

I am currently building a kiosk environment that encompasses a touchscreen
interface.  FVWM will be running under GNOME.  I want to run my application
(mozilla1.0) completely chromeless and edge to edge onscreen.  No titles, no
menus no handles, nothing but dynamic browser content.

I have edited the file:
 /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc and changed the following:

DeskTopSize 2X2 
to 
DeskTopSize 1X1

Style "*"           BorderWidth 7, HandleWidth 7
to 
Style "*"           BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, notitle, nohandles

I am still getting window titles and an embossed dark grey bar that runs the
perimeter of my screen.  The  FAQ's on the FVWM  site read that under RedHat
i need to look for AnotherLevel or theNextLevel.  Neither of these two
programs have been installed on my system.  I have also tried copying
system.fvwm2rc into a new directory: /etc/X11/.fvwm2/ with no luck.

Does any one here have any experience running FVWM chromeless and
full-screen?

-thank you.

I even use ResizeMaximize instead of the normal Resize command.
My windows usually start at a standard size and position.  When a
different geometry is needed, I just draw-resize them as usual,
and when I'm done with them I simply "unmaximize" them.  This
concept effectively introduces a mini stack of window sizes
allowing to temporarily modify the geometry and restoring the
original one with a single key press.

The configuration should be placed in $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.  There
is a FAQ section regarding AnotherLevel too:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  I use FVWM on a RedHat Linux system and can't figure out how to
     change my FVWM configuration.  I've read the FVWM man page but when
     I edit my .fvwm2rc nothing seems to happen.  What's going on?

A: RedHat Linux installs the X server accompanied (by default) by a
   configuration management system.  In earlier releases it was called
   TheNextLevel and in more recent releases it's called AnotherLevel.
   For further information about TheNextLevel, consult RedHat's
   documentation in /usr/doc/TheNextLevel/.  For information about
   AnotherLevel, do a 'man AnotherLevel'.

And how to display the miniicon in the window list. (I'm talking about the icon
many apps have "builtin")
How to start an external app at a given location on screen at startup.(it doesnt

And, windows are now iconified at the top left, i want them to start at bottom

Well, maybe it's not such a good idea to ignore clicks with
modifiers pressed by default.

First, define the mini icons you want to use:

  Style * miniicon my_default_miniicon.xpm
  Style xterm miniicon my_xterm_miniicon.xpm
  ...

> And how to display the miniicon in the window list. (I'm talking about the icon

The mini icons show up automatically once they are defined, but
you have to do that manually.  The normal icon provided by the
application is not used.

In the ~/.Xdefaults file you can put something like

  xemacs.geometry: 81x54-0+0

I don't know right know where u find the man page for the syntax.

Use the IconBox style, e.g.:

  Style * IconBox 1000x200+0-0

(see man page for details).

Yes: on my laptop I have fvwm2-2.4.6-1 (standard from RH 7.3) and
fvwm 2.5.3-devel from CVS, and I'm sure I'm picking up the 2.5.3-devel.

I discovered that I was using the 2.5.3 modules instead of the 2.5.3-devel
ones, but fixing this had no effect on the focus stuff.

I checked out a new fvwm tree from scratch, and rebuild and installed from
there, same problems. I also tried to remove ConfigFvwmDefaults, without 
success.

Some good news:

a) I found thet problem 1 is a 'consequence' of problem 2, i.e. if I put 
   the 'Style * ClickToFocus' after all other Styles statements (with the 
   cavead described below), then GrabFocus is indeed the default for 
   ClickToFocus.

b) I found that problem 3 is not a real one: I was moving the 'Style * 
   ClickToFocus' line after a 'Style FvwmPager NeverFocus', and then I was 
   using the Pager to change desk, and of course the window was losing its 
   focus. Sorry for this additional unwanted 'noise'.

In the end, the problem can be reduced to the fact with a .fvwm2rc like:

Style * Icon unknown1.xpm
Style * ClickToFocus

clicks work (i.e. a click on W both focusses and raises)

Style * ClickToFocus
Style * Icon unknown1.xpm

clicks fail (i.e. a click on W only focusses).

At least, for me :-( ...

cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hi Dominik,

I've thought of using the same thing in the past, but well I haven't found
the free time to figure out how to do it.  Would you care to embellish on
how you accomplish this?

Thanks,

Tom

Anything which trips the filters gets sent to me for approval.  It can
occasionally take me a little while to approve things, especially when
they come in while I'm asleep.  The filters are extensive.  Why do you
think this list sees so little spam when anyone can post to it?  Spam
and viruses sent to the list outnumber legitimate traffic by a factor
of at least five to one.

Pretty much every list works like this, except for the lists that just
throw away messages which trip the filters (leading to messages which
are lost instead of delayed).

Really? And I thought you loved it! I had built up those messages over a
fortnight while upgrading AnotherLevelUp, and sent them when I did just before
a week's break (doing some *real* hacking, mislabelled as ``gardening''!). So
there was no rush for you to reply. :-) I should have guessed you would still
manage to process them in real time!

You're welcome -- with more thanks for your help.

I am about to reply to some of your other messages -- please don't stay up all
night to answer them!

Yes, I agree again, now that I understand the problem is merely about the
cursor, because it would happen during a ``WaitExec'' anyway.

I have tried this but it does not work. :-( I had not switched on BusyCursor
for read anyway -- off by default -- so no surprise. I guess the read /
PipeRead code currently grabs the mouse even if BusyCursor read is off. I
shall continue to anticipate a fix in time for 2.6, and use Exec instead for
this function, for FVWM 2.4 and 2.5 in AnotherLevelUp. ;-)

I had to think about this one -- but now I see what you're saying. If
BusyCursor Read is on, then FVWM keeps the mouse, so any mouse clicks during a
PipeRead over FvwmButtons windows are actually received by FVWM. In 2.4, FVWM
then acts on this queued event after the PipeRead, e.g. popping up the root
menu. In 2.5, FVWM is clever enough to ignore the event if the click was over
a window rather than some uncovered root window space -- very sensible.

I believe that FVWM 2.4/2.5 grabs the mouse even if BusyCursor Read is off
(see previous email), as the behaviour I have just described happens
regardless. Otherwise, your advice to have BusyCursor Read off would probably
give the same behaviour as FVWM 2.2.

Why does FVWM need to grab the mouse in order to show a busy cursor anyway?
Consider some `long' PipeRead being done. One ought to be able to continue
using, say, an xterm, while FVWM is busy. So a click in the xterm would work
as normal, but when the mouse is moved onto the root window, it would show the
busy cursor, so the user knows that the menu will not work yet, etc.. Or am I
missing something? I guess I must be, otherwise you would not have grabbed the
mouse ever, and would have shown a WAIT (watch) cursor at all times when FVWM
was busy, and you wouldn't need a BusyCursor command! So, what am I missing?

I ask because, assuming the grab when BusyCursor is off problem gets fixed,
I'm tempted to not use BusyCursor, but set the root cursor explicitly (e.g.
via xsetroot) to a watch every time I do a PipeRead, and back again when it is
finished (e.g. by a simple wrapper script or M4 define). Would I be asking for
trouble?

Ooops - I missed that warning in the 2.4 FvwmTaskBar man page. May I suggest
that fvwm24_convert might produce a warning for this? I used the observations
``it is working or not'' and then the fvwm24_convert script to drive my
upgrade process; and I didn't reread every man page! Naughty me... Thanks for
pointing it out.

My apologies: I forgot to convert it for the example. The reason I use the old
syntax is that I try to make AnotherLevelUp backwards compatable with FVWM
2.0, and wish to keep the FVWM version-specific parts to a minimum. (I know of
at least once person who still uses it on a default Red Hat 5.1 installation.)

That's great thanks: I'll use this approach for FVWM 2.4 onwards.

Yes, that's because it's running in a complex function.  Make it a
single command and it works:

  PipeRead "echo 'BusyCursor read off'; echo 'Current (Capture) Iconify'; echo xwd -out out.xwd; echo 'Prev (Capture) Iconify'; echo 'BusyCursor read on'"

I can see why you suggest this, but no. Some AnotherLevelUp themes use Insets,
and some don't. You are on the right lines, in that it's those that do NOT use
insets that show up the difference most. However, there really was a black box
around the inner window with and without insets in FVWM 2.2 (and 2.0 I think)
and this has gone from 2.4 and 2.5.

I have made some screen shots, and invite you to look at

        http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/FVWM-TEMP

to see comparisons of the 2.2 and 2.5 decorations.

It's not a big deal, but I think the little black line was nice! :-)

This was indeed a Red Herring. I now understand why this stopped working! It's
that BusyCursor thing yet again: during the Wait, FVWM was holding the mouse,
so the user could not click on the FvwmForm buttons, which were the trigger
for ending the Wait. And I had not set BusyCursor Wait on, sugesting that FVWM
always grabs the mouse for a Wait too, regardless of BusyCursor Wait on/off.

The multi threading `feel' I had was coming from the FvwmForm process running
in parallel to FVWM, so one could say the `whole thing' is multi threaded, but
the mouse grabs now make the UI single threaded.

My new approach is much more reliable anyway. I seem to remember being unhappy
with the old approach, but needed to do it that way because I didn't realise
one could generate FvwmForm configurations dynamically (e.g. PipeRead) at the
time I first wrote it.

Thank you.

BTW, I have just spotted another ``fully functional'' phrase that you might
like to edit, at least it is still present in the 2.5.2 man page, in the
BusyCursor section.

Well, it probably wasn't even a conscious choice.  The events are
eaten up by the wrong window, so we couldn't trigger window
actions even if we wanted to.

In complex functions, the pointer must be grabbed to prevent
screwing up certain kinds of functions.

Because you can't change the cursor in specific places without
grabbing the pointer.  It's not nice, but can hardly be prevented.

The whole idea of the busy cursor is to indicate when fvwm does
not accept input.  Unfortunately it sometimes blocks useful
operations by other clients.

That won't be fixed as it *is* a fix for certain functions.  To
circumvent the problem you have to put everything in a single
command (or perhaps a shell script feeding PipeRead).

No, that's safe.  It just does not change the cursor everywhere as
the busy cursor does.

Sorry for not making it clearer. The resizes happen as the window gets
repacked, so most steps above cause an overall size change.

I have managed to make a small program that consistently fails on 2.4, for me,

I can imagine it is timing dependent here too. I have tried sleeps of various
sizes between the main steps, but it makes no difference. So, if it is timing,
it must be within the (Perl)Tk functions. I have tried it on a PIII 800 and a
K6-2 500, with the same effects.

Out of interest, what is the easiest way to monitor the window manager
requests made by a single application?

Here is the program. Press ``DoIt'', and it should collapse, then expand with
a black text area, then expand more with a white text area. On FVWM 2.4 it
ends up staying small, and you have to press ``Resize'' to make it get the
right size.

Thanks for your clues -- mainly you stopped me looking in the wrong places. I
now realise that the lack of focus at start up and after restart was caused by
GrabFocus for certain windows being started which were click to focus (e.g.
xbiff, pager), even though most were sloppy focus. I just needed to add
GrabFocusOff to xbiff, pager etc..

Having thought a little about this, I have a suggestion to make.

The default GrabFocus for ClickToFocus and GrabFocusOff for MouseFocus are
sensible, only if all windows have the same focus policy. In a mixed policy
regime, perhaps the policy of the window which currently has focus should be
taken into account before giving focus to a newly created window. I am tempted
to suggest another pair of styles called, say, ReleaseFocus and
ReleaseFocusOff.

ReleaseFocus would be default for ClickToFocus, and ReleaseFocusOff would be
default for MouseFocus (and SloppyFocus). A new window would get the focus if
and only if it has GrabFocus style, AND the current window has ReleaseFocus
style.

What do you think?

Ah, but that's not part of the window decoration.  The black
border is part of the xterm window itself.  I can't remember any
fvwm release that intentionally showed the client window border,
so it's either a 2.2.x bug or drawn by xterm into its own window.

They already exist in 2.5.3-devel:

  FPGrabFocus
  FPGrabFocusTransient
  FPOverrideGrabFocus
  FPReleaseFocus
  FPReleaseFocusTransient
  FPOverrideReleaseFocus

 .... stuff about BusyCursor and PipeRead with the capture form.


> > I have tried this but it does not work. :-( I had not switched on BusyCursor

> No, it's on by default.

Hmm - I believed the man page:

	``The default is:

                   BusyCursor DynamicMenu False, \
                     ModuleSynchronous False, Read False, \
                     Recapture True, Wait False''

(I am using FVWM 2.5.2).

The only BusyCursor commands in my M4 output are:

	BusyCursor DynamicMenu True

and those which are part of the Capture stuff.

Before doing anything with the capture form after a restart, I have just tried

	PipeRead "sleep 5"

via FvwmTalk (I know, I should use FvwmConsole!...) and I got no watch cursor
during the delay. Doing a BusyCursor read on then the same PipeRead does
indeed give me a watch for 5 seconds.

Really? Why does that make a difference? (Ahh -- see below.)

Slight error in your suggestion echo xwd should be xwd. I have just tried it,
and it works -- brilliant thanks!

So, given that I'm convinced that BusyCursor read is already off (sorry!), I
have just tried:

*CaptureCommand         PipeRead "echo 'Current (Capture) Iconify'; xwd -out /home/jtl/captured-window; echo 'Prev (Capture) Iconify'"

(i.e. what you suggested, but without the BusyCursor parts, and I need to fix
up the file name part) and...

	IT WORKS!!!

Maybe it is not so connected to BusyCursor as we thought?

Ah ha -- your next email explains it all.

	> In complex functions, the pointer must be grabbed to prevent
	> screwing up certain kinds of functions.

I now realise this accounts for the problem I had with Wait too, as that was
being executed in a Function (of course).

I have just looked, but could not find a mention of this in the man page. I
think it is quite a significant feature of functions and ought to be
documented, if you don't mind me saying so. Also, is it worth considering
having the ability to disable the grab when the user needs it and knows it is
safe to? (When would it be safe?).

Many thanks for your help.

Really? Well, those shots were made using the same xterm code so the only
difference is the version of FVWM. Also, it's not just xterm windows that have
the `feature', e.g. FvwmForm has it too. So I guess 2.2.x had a bug that drew
the client window border (assuming that FvwmForms have those as much as xterms
do -- I am ignorant of X to that extent).

Excellent!! I promise when I get a bit settled work wise (...), I'll start

Alas! Jason L Tibbitts III spake thus:

I have seen a number of lists in which anybody subscribed can post
without restriction, but messages that come from people who are not
subscribed are either a) rejected or b) sent to the list admin for
approval.

Since I've *never* seen a spammer who subscribes to mailing lists just
to spam them (unless you want to start talking about trolls, but that's
different), then that method works very well. I had just assumed that
this list works the same way, and since we were all subscribed, none of
our posts would be moderated.

I guess both methods have their merits, though.

Oh, this is so embarassing.  You are right, I set this im my

Actually, I meant "echo exec xwd ...", but your version works as
well (as long as xwd doesn't print anything to stdout).

It is not documented because nobody knows exactly what is going
on.

The problem is:  nobody knows exactly when it is safe.  Not even
me.  All I know is that releasing the grab has the potential to
transfer the focus to a random window on the desktop (with
MouseFocus or SloppyFocus).

I see that funny behaviour.  The application simply requests the
small size and never asks for anything else, so what fvwm-2.4 is
doing is right.  Under 2.5, the application requests the large
size after shrinking and gets exactly this.  I do not have the
faintest idea why the application behaves differently with the two
versions.  I'm not surprised either because there have been a
number of similar reports where tk behaves funny.

Put debug statements in the code (HandleConfigureRequest function
in events.c).

(Wait etc).

What exactly is the problem?  You already figured out the command
name ;-)

  BusyCursor DynamicMenu on, ModuleSynchronous on, Read on, Recapture on, Wait on

You probably don't need the DynamicMenu, ModuleSynchronous and
Recapture bits.

Bye

 Hi,

 i run my machine under Debian woody.

 When i tried to switch to fvwm i had problems running
 fvwm (offical deb package v2.4.8). 
 First i could not get it started with xdm but was still able 
 to launch it from an xterm. Later on, however, i was not able 
 to launch it at all what ever i tried.

 Finally i decided to down load the source and compile it myself,
 First i downloaded v.2.5.2 and it was running fine but later on
 i thought it would be may be safer to have the stable version.
 And now that i compiled and tried to run v2.4.9 i have exactly the
 same problem.


 There are two error messeges about fvwm not being able
 to find a fontset:
 [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset 'fixed', trying
 '-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'
  [FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: ERROR -- can't get fontset
  '-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'

  The xserver /xfontsel/ does know about these fonts so they are
  definitely not missing (and the fontsever is running).


  Originally i had xdm setup to start up the window manager.
  In this case, after a blank window i got back to the login window
  (while any other window man e.g. icewm, sawfish or even gnome-session
  can be started without probs).
  xdm.log says:
  X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
  warning: process set to nice value 0 instead of -10 as requested
  (but i believe this is not about fvwm)

  I also tried to start fvwm from an xterm only xsession:
  i got the above errormsg about the fontset and nothing
  else hapens interestingly before the restart this worked
  despite the errormsgs.
  I tried this also as root - no difference. And run strace: i find
  the same erromsgs but nothing else that would give me a cue what
  is going on.

  I hope some of you do have an idea what could the problem

The application is lieing about its focus model.  It claims that it
never sets the focus itself but still does so.  This is a clear
violation of the ICCCM rules.  The window *must* set the
WM_TAKES_FOCUS protocol in the WM_PROTOCOLS property and abide to
it.  If the problem persists once the application has been fixed,
please report back.

Three questions to you.

1) Did you built 2.4.x with --enable-multibyte? (run: fvwm-config -s)

2) What is your locale? (run: locale)

3) Does fvwm immediately exit? If no, do you get the root menu?

Mikhael.

In 2.5.x, the mini icon and icon provided by EWMH compliant applications,
for example KDE 2.x/3.x or GNOME 2.x, are used unless explicitly disabled.

So, in 2.5.x you don't need to define MiniIcon and Icon for these apps.
But you can, of course.

Dominik, you always suggest to edit .Xdefaults, but this usually only
works with apps that already support -geometry or -xrm parameters.

GNOME and KDE applications (or gtk+ and qt applications for that reason)
do not support X resource database, so this suggestion does not work.

Many such applications support --geometry or --position command line
parameters (2 dashes). If no, your solution is FAQ #3.18.

Mikhael.

I have the same problem with fvwm 2.4.x. Every time I install a new
package with dselect or with apt-get the fvwm get updated to 2.4.x.
and then I can't login, the error is the same with the fixed font.
I have to manually downgrade fvwm to 2.2.4 (hopefully I still have a
*.deb for that).

In my case:

1. I did not compile fvwm myself. I use the *.deb file from woody.
2. I use locale ro_RO.ISO-8859-16.
3. fvwm exits immediately.

I also have compatibilities problems because I use fvwm 2.2.4-2
instead of 2.4.6-2. fvwm recommends fvwm-common, xlibs conflicts with
fvwm-common. I think I need an older xlibs (I have 4.1.0-17).
But I can't find, for instance 4.1.0-14. I never can exit from the
dselect menu. I have to make a full upgrade and then "dpkg -i
fvwm_2.2.4-2.deb".

Thank you,
        Ionel

...

I had similar problems with 2.4.6 as distributed by Red Hat 7.3, and with
2.4.8 when I compiled it myself with the multi-byte option. I ended up
concluding that multi-byte is flakey on the 2.4 series when used with a
non-posix locale, and that Red Hat had been a bit naughty to enable it in
their distro. It all seems fine in 2.5. Nobody on this list confirmed that
summary.

Perhaps Debian has enabled it too?

Two fixes are:

	Recompile without the -enable-multi-byte option.

Or, of you want to use a pre-compiled dodgey 2.4 binary:

	Right near the start of your config file, insert:

		SetEnv LANG C
		SetEnv LC_CTYPE ""


Good luck.

Best wishes, John Latham

P.s. I have been using FVWM 2.5.2 every day since early July, and it has been
very stable.... I'me even thinking of using it here for our 700+ linux users!

Good point about stdout from xwd -- I should redirect it to /dev/null. I did
wonder if you meant "echo exec xwd ...", but thought it would not be reliable,
as the following Prev (Capture) Iconify would be executed during the Exec of
xwd. True?

> > I have just tried it, and it works -- brilliant thanks!

In the end I have gone for multiple *CaptureCommand lines because I couldn't
get the PipeRead version to work well on FVWM2.2 for some reason!! (Which is
not work looking at.)

	*CaptureButton      continue  "Capture" ^M
	# Must not use a function for CaptureCommand,
	# because of mouse grab during functions.
	# This configuration works with FVWM 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5
	*CaptureCommand     BusyCursor read off
	*CaptureCommand     Current [Capture] Iconify
	*CaptureCommand     PipeRead "xwd -out \"$(file)\" $(Options);"
	*CaptureCommand     Prev [Capture] Iconify
	*CaptureCommand     BusyCursor read on

>From the FvwmForm man page, it is not explicitly clear that you can have
multiple command lines for one button and that they are executed by FVWM in
the order specified, but it seems to work fine. Is it worth putting some
multiple ones in an example: e.g. the Capture Window example would be an
obvious one? :-)

I can believe it! :-) However, even a one-line mention in the AddToFunc
description would be useful, if you don't mind me saying so.

Yes, I can see that. It is probably never safe to release the mouse. However,
your proposed workaround of using a PipeRead must suffer from the same lack of
safety (if BusyCursor read is off): e.g. if the user moves the mouse between
bits of output from the program being read into the pipe. But the PipeRead
workaround is much less convenient than just having something like a
``UnsafeMouseFocus'' option on AddToFunc. (I am thinking of writing a bit of
M4 to turn a function into a PipeRead just for this workaround!)

Or, at the risk of me showing total ignorance, would it be possible to make
Wait and PipeRead (etc). always release the mouse (or maybe only if BusyCursor
is off) when they start, but first remember the window which is focussed. Then
at the end grab the mouse (waiting if necessary) and restore focus? PipeRead
would also do a grab/restore before it executes each command it receives, and
release again afterwards. Or is that looney and asking for stacks of core
dump?

Thank you very much for confirming it is Perl or Tk at fault. If I find out
any clues as to why it behaves differently on 2.4 I shall let you know (e.g.
Tk misinterpreting some info *from* fvwm?).

The rlogin form shown in the man page has multiple commands
attached to one button.  I guess the man page could be more specific
though.  I'll fix it in a minute.

So it does -- I beg your pardon. I must have missed it because of the long
lines and comments. Don't get me wrong: it is a very nice example in itself.

When using for example motif tear-off menus, some menu entries used to be
"shaded out" because they are not useable (like an entry boud to Resize).
Now (I'm using 2.5.2) they never are (although there is a beep when trying
to use them).
I converted my setup to use Colorsets some time ago. Do you have to
specifically set a Colorset for the shaded out entries?
Is this why it fails to work?
Or is the menu code undergoing some rewrite now, and this has been
disabled?

Right.  executing it directly with "> /dev/null" is the most

You're right.

I wonder if any effort should be made to ease using functionality
that does not work well.  Maybe it should rather stay unintuitive
so that users have to ask on the list before doing such things.

Doesn't work with functions that set the focus explicitly.  There
are numerous occurances where you want the focus change.

Maybe not for core dumps, but our users will tear down the whole
place :-)

Can you post the relevant parts of your config? (menu styles,
the corresponding menus and mouse bindings and the styles
controlling the actions that are allowed).

This is not needed. I fixed small this problem on 2002-06-28, four days
after the 2.5.2 release. :)

Another thought.

I have a function like this:

AddToFunc Restore		"I" Current [Iconic] Iconify false
+				"I" Cond (Match) Break
+				"I" Current [!Iconic] Maximize false

and an entry in a window menu for this.
Would it be very hard to extend the "greying out" functionality to handle
cases like this, marking this as unavailable for non-maximised windows
(since "Maximize false" only makes sense for maximised windows).
A similar thing is a menu I have with entries for switching desks,
switching to the current desk is also not "doing anything"

This is ofcourse only a cosmetic issue and is not the most important, so
I'm not saying this is something you should put a lot of energy into.

I guess it could be quite complex.

Yes, it is pretty impossible to implement, a compiler comparable task.
Especially when your function Restore works _always_, so I see no any
special reason to disable a menu item it is bound to.

On the other hand if you would rewrite this function to be:

  DestroyFunc Restore
  AddToFunc   Restore
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic, !Shaded, Maximized) Maximize    false
  + I ThisWindow (!Iconic,  Shaded,          ) WindowShade false
  + I ThisWindow ( Iconic                    ) Iconify     false

it's easier to see that there is the case (!Iconic, !Shaded, !Maximized)
when nothing is executed. But it is still pretty impossible for the
generic case when you call other functions or PipeRead in your function.

I think, if there is any solution to this, it is to specify a condition
(!Iconic, !Shaded, !Maximized) at the menu item definition time that is
executed on every menu popup to find whether it should be disabled.

Mikhael.

Hi Mikhael

> 1) Did you built 2.4.x with --enable-multibyte? (run: fvwm-config -s)
yes, both the Debian package and what i compiled was with
--enable-multibyte
 
> 2) What is your locale? (run: locale)
en_IE@euro 
 
> 3) Does fvwm immediately exit? If no, do you get the root menu?
fvwm exits immediately

Your questions seem to be in the same direction what John wrote.
And now i occurs to me that when i was able to start fvwm from 
an xterm i had a typo and the locale was set back to "C".
So this seem to explain everythin.

Thanks

Well, the application never grabs the focus, it only moves the focus
between its subwindows after its main window gets focus. Even though
ICCCM says that the applications with "Locally Active Input" should
specify WM_TAKE_FOCUS, it also says:

       The goal is to support window managers that want to assign
       the  input  focus to a top-level window in such a way that
       the top-level window either can assign it to  one  of  its
       subwindows  or  can  decline  the offer of the focus.  For
       example, a clock or a text editor with no  currently  open
       frames might not want to take focus even though the window
       manager generally believes that clients  should  take  the
       input focus after being deiconified or raised.

Declining the focus is not an issue with Tk. It also does not need the
window manager returning focus to the exact Tk's subwindow that had
the focus before it was switched out: once Tk's main window gets focus,
it can take care of passing it down by itself.

Fixing all the copies of Tk out there is also not really an option. In 
this I would argue that the principle similar to IETF's "adhere to the
standards as closely as possible in your outputs but accept as wide variety 
of inputs as possible" should apply to the window managers as well. And 
seeing the focus change on mouse movement while I specifically selected
the focus mode that disables that looks wrong too.

Basically, what I would like to know is whether this happened occasionally
or was done by design ? If it was done occasionally, I may be able
to find out the reason and provide a fix. If it was done by design,
I suppose the fvwm project would not be interested in this fix.

It *must not* no this without using the WM_TAKES_FOCUS protocol
(see below).

Anyway, we can't go about introducing bug after bug in fvwm just
to cope with Tk which is totally broken in many aspects of window
handling.  Some bugs are knows for years and described pretty well
and nothing was ever done in Tk about them.

The standard is that the WM can do with the focus whatever it
likes if the application fails to use the WM_TAKES_FOCUS protocol.

It's not a fix because nothing is broken except the application.
There are a few places where fvwm refreshes the focus for windows
using WM_TAKES_FOCUS to the specific subwindow that had the focus
and that works pretty well.  Of course this works only if the
application requests the right focus policy.  If Tk can't handle
that protocol, then a Tk application can not manage focus in its
subwindows without violating the spec.

That would be helpful, thank you. There must be many others who have yet to
change from 2.2 who may fall fowl when they do, if they were being `ambitious'
like I was in AnotherLevelUp. Something like the following might be useful,
perhaps in the AddToFunc decription:

	Please note, since version 2.3 (or 4), FVWM grabs and hold the mouse
	during execution of complex functions. This is to increase reliablity
	of window focus, but does mean that mouse clicks over any window while
	a function is executing, will be received by FVWM, and not the window.
	This may affect the behaviour of some configurations that worked in
	previous versions of FVWM, particularly if the function execution
	contains a Wait or a Read/PipeRead and hence takes some time to
	execute.

You are probably right. I may be biased by my recent experience, and yet I
have found a nice way of doing *most* of the things I could do before, without
ultimately needing to use the unsafe workaround. :-)

Yes, and I guess you couldn't reliably detect which ones are wanted in the
context of the function, and which ones are not. :-(

Correct. And it would be nice if it liked to handle even those applications
gratiously.

What if we call it a "feature" ?

Hi all.  Does anyone know how to attach a sound to the action of a mouse
click?  I'm using a touch screen in a kiosk environment and am looking for a
quick solution for this.

To bind any mouse button anywhere:

  Mouse 0 A A  Exec play /my/sound.au

To bind only the third mouse button in the root window:

  Mouse 3 R A  Exec esdplay /my/sound.wav

To bind only the first mouse button with Alt in the client window:

  Mouse 1 W M  Exec ogg123 /my/sound.ogg

I use 
export LC_ALL=ro_RO
export LANG=ro
in .xinitrc
no problems
I think the locale for Romania should be
ro_RO.ISO-8859-2.
Is there any reason for using ro_RO.ISO-8859-16 ?

If you compile it manually maybe you can fool debian 
that you have what he wants while still running 
your favourite version of fvwm.

It includes the euro sign and some other small changes AFAIK.

I suppose fvwm-2.4.x exits when it does not find fixed *-iso8859-16 font.
By the way these patches to replace searching for strictly "fixed" font
were demanded by the Debian maintainer, I think he included these or
similar patches before creating debs anyway. I hoped he or someone else
will reply to other Debian specific questions asked in this thread.

I don't have ro_RO.ISO-8859-16 locale on my system to test anything.
Anyway the solution should be to use fonts existing in your locale or
explicitely specify charset (like *-fixed-*-iso8859-2) when defining
fonts, or switch to 2.5.x where i18n and font handling is much improved.
But prepare to get warnings if the used fonts do not match your locale.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry, but i don't understand this:
If such a patch was requested and applied why does the program exit
after not finding one set of fixed fonts?
((There is only one errormsg /to be precise - one msg twice/,
and also it is misleading as it does not specify that it is looking 
for /in my case/ *-iso8859-15 fonts.)) 


This also suggests that the maintainers are aware of (at least some) 
problems on this "front". This is to put it very softly, as John did 
it earlier "a bit naughty" against all those "stupid users" like me.

Is there a concise, authoritative guide to the proper syntax,
organization and such of .fvwm2rc contents somewhere? What I see in the
fvwm man page often conflicts with what's in the sample system.fvwm2rc
file and the few pointers I do find in the man pages are scattered and
terse, to say the least.

Sorry if I sound frustrated, but I am...

I've just spent 30 minutes or more with one MenuStyle line trying to get
it to work (without success).  Despite close to an hour's work, I've
been unable to get FvwmTaskBar to appear at the bottom of the screen
(despite following the examples from the man page). I can change the
border widths and nothing ever happens.  I've used the recommended
geometry, but it always appears at the top of the screen. I'm light
years away from doing anything useful with it, but at this rate I'll
never get there. I'm having the do *EVERYTHIHG* by trial and error,
since the man page is so vague (or maybe I'm just stupid...?).

I'm rapidly reaching my frustration threshold before moving on to
something else.

There has to be somewhere a definition of exactly what is and isn't
allowed configuration-wise, where specific entries need to go,
recommended order, syntax restrictions, case-sensitivity, etc., etc.

If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it. I really like the speed and small
size of fvwm, but the appalling lack of documentation is about to
convince me to look elsewhere...

Thanks.

Hi,
I just wanted to add that fvwm2 is a great window manager - but I agree
that the man page is hard to read and understand!

So here is a little suggestion to improve the man page: Insert a section
(at the beginning) which deals with the basic configuration faqs - and
show examples right there. Most important: Let this section be organized
by *the point of view of a beginner* who just wants to change color of
background, change the root menu, change the window styles. If he passed
that he will have enough starting enegery to go through the rest of the
man page. ;-)

(I hope the one who wrote the man page is not insalted ... ;-)

Bye
 Felix

Well, the multibyte support is marked experimental in 2.4.x and disabled
by default. Sorry it caused you any problems.

The only authoritative guide to the proper syntax is man pages. You may
just start with an empty file and put any commands described in the man
page in any order according to your needs. Use functions for efficiency.
Usually you need at least:

  # StartFunction to start modules, InitFunction to start apps
  # mouse and key bindings
  # color definitions, I suggest to use colorsets
  # window decorations including border, buttons, title bar
  # menu definitions
  # module configurations
  # global and window specific styles

If you want examples, I can suggest is to take a look at the themes of
fvwm-themes. For example, here is the content of the default theme:

    background
  + bindings
  + buttons
  + colors
  + cursors
    fonts
  + functions
  + functions-appbind
  + globalfeel
  + globallook
  + menus
  + menus-programs
  + menustyle
  + modules/
    settings/
    sound
    startup
  + styles
  + windowlook

Most of these components are plain fvwmrc configs, but not all.
There are several special functions that make the whole thing
configurable and efficient that you may ignore when creating .fvwm2rc.
I marked by plus the components that you may just learn from.

If you like the concept of dividing the entire configuration into
replaceable components, you may customize fvwm-themes by creating your own
theme (directory) with several components (files), but read its FAQ first.

Do the following. Open FvwmConsole (start it in StartFunction or bind to
a menu). Then type these commands in FvwmConsole:

  *FvwmTaskBar: Geometry +0-0
  FvwmTaskBar

Does it still appear on the top? Is it possible you change another
.fvwm2rc? You should edit ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.

The man pages are complete, although may contain small glitches that are
constantly fixed. Please try to narrow your problems with documentation.
For each problem start a new thread here and specify what you did, what
you got and what you want/expect to get. Provide all relevent details.

 sorry, the criticism was not directed against you.
 I was just somewhat puzzled by what you said.
 To have an experimetal feature is fine, but to have it 
 enabled in a "stable" distribution (Debian and RH) is not
 - especially when it is not documented for the user.
 But again this should be directed to a different forum.

There are 2 borderwidths, for windows and menus.

For menus, this works:

MenuStyle * BorderWidth 10

I suspect you are having problems with the borders on windows.
Perhaps you missed this in the man page:

              With  the  NoHandles style, the window does not get
              the handles in the window corners that are commonly
              used  to resize it.  With NoHandles, the width from
              the BorderWidth style is used.  By default,  or  if
              Handles  is  is  specified, the width from the Han=AD
              dleWidth style is used.

So, if you have

 Style * NoHandles

Then this works:

 Style * BorderWidth 10

Otherwise, use this:

 Style * HandleWidth 10

Fvwm may be speedy and small, but the amount of configuration possible
is massive.  Hence the extremly large man page, and difficulty getting
started.

man pages are there for reference.  their function is not to be a
collection of FAQ's, tutorials & what not.  they can, however, point
to other resources which may provide the help that a beginner may
need.

the default F1 key binding (for fvwm help) could/should point to
such tutorials & FAQ's instead of a man page then.


let's not spam the man page please.

speaking of which, is there any plan in near future to remove
"GlobalOpts ... -> Style" pointers?

So, why don't you go ahead and write something like that?

With this ongoing discussion about the manpage, I'd like to add my two
cents (US or Euro - I don't know).  I've been using fvwm longer than I
can remember.  However, I can remember the times when it was
maintained by Rob Nation, and I think there's still a tape with my
config-file for fvwm 1.xy, although I doubt that I can find a drive to
read it.

The thing I like most about fvwm is it nearly infinite flexibility and
configurability.  That comes with a price, the documentation is only
for someone who is willing to read a whole reference manual before he
starts using the program.  But even the best documentation would be
long (probably too long for newbies) and difficult to understand
because for many things you have to understand the whole picture
(which sometimes includes more than fvwm).

And frankly, I don't want the fvwm developers to write documentation
for beginning.  I want them to fix old bugs and add new features so I
can get more out of it.  That works pretty well so far.  If fvwm came
with a graphical configuration tool, I could as well use Gnome, KDE,
or M$-Windows.

Also, I don't think the fvwm developers would be very good at writing
a tutorial for beginners.  You have to remember how it was when you
were a newby to write something a newby can understand.

It would probably be best if someone who wrote or modified his first
fvwm2rc not too long ago would write a few paragraphs about what he
wanted and how he achieved it.  I'm sure the developers would be
willing to comment on it and give advice if there are better ways to
achieve the desired behavior.  But it's *YOU*, the newbies out there
who know what the confusing things are, not the fvwm developers!

Fvwm and its documentation are open source, if there's something you
don't like, fix it.  If you are able to edit your fvwm2rc, you should
be able to write a little text about it, you don't need a degree in
computer science for that.

Thank you for your attention, I go back to lurking now.

Exactly.  So we're back to the issue that we need a tutorial.

Or maybe not.  The F1 key is overloaded already by the various
help systems.

It may not be in the near future.  But the GlobalOpts command
*will* be removed in 3.0.

Concidering myself a newbie I'd like to do that. The only problem is: a
newbie knows the problems - but can't provide the solutions.

I don't think you'll spam the man page if you insert a short section for
the main issues beginners have. And, my favorite way to do it is nearly
already done: Look at man FvwmIconMan, "Configuration Options Reference
Chart". Add one single column to it with an example command and there
you go.

Look, isn't fvwm2 worth it to forget maybe tine a little bit about the
guide lines of man pages and follow the wishes of many beginners to
fvwm2 - since they'll all start typing m-a-n instead of querying goole
for some tutorial?

Please excuse my passion - it's just the passion for fvwm2.

If a colourset used in Menustyle * is updated while a "torn-off" root menu
is on the screen FvwmConsole spits out the following:
[FVWM][menustyle_update]: <<ERROR>> menu style * is in use
[FVWM][menustyle_update]: <<ERROR>> menu style * is in use

and the colour of the menu is not updated, although the next menu to be
posted gets the correct colours.

I'm using the snapshot from yesterday (24:th). Is it worth pulling down
the latest 2.4.3 (saw it was released today)?

I have the following lines set:

# and some special for TK tear-off menus
Style Menu	NoButton 2, NoButton 4, NoHandles, FixedSize

it's still possible to maximise those windows (through the menu or using
FvwmConsole and so on)
Shouldn't FixedSize inhibit maximising?

Agreed - Except that it's a bit difficult to accurately document
something in terms someone else can understand when the "documetor"
doesn't understand it. For example, I've seen the following examples for
FvwmTaskBar :

>From the fvwm webpage :

I am in no way singling out FvwmTaskBar - I just happened to be working
with it lately. The second example works, the first doesn't (as far as I
can tell). This is typical of what I'm apparently misunderstanding. It
appears that fvwm plays very loose and fast with the config file in
terms of syntax? Or am I just missing something? It appears that there's
always more than one way to do anything, which I guess has its merits,
but is almost always initially more confusing than a tightly controlled
syntax. For example, do all of the parts of a function or menu
definition need to be in one place (immediately under the AddToFunc or
AddToMenu), or can they be spread around. If the latter, what's the
advantage? It seems like you'd want them all grouped together anyway,
just organizationally. I tend to look on config files in general much
like source code - Make them modular, organized and as easy to read as
possible.

I've seen a couple of replies to my original post that I've yet to read
carefully and digest, so I'll not waste bandwidth here asking questions
they may answer.


However, I do have one concerning FvwmTaskBar (no, make that two) :

1. With BorderWidth and HandleWidth set to 1 or 0, the taskbar doesn't
occupy the full width of the screen. Is there a way to force this?

2. When I configure a Popup StartMenu, is there a way to accurately
control where it appears on screen, in regard to the Start button? If I
understood MenuStyle a bit better, maybe the answer is there
(PopupOffset, or whatever it's called)...?


OK - One more (general) question :

Is there a way to globally turn off mouse pointer warping so that it
never warps to a menu, window, whatever? That's one behavior I _really_
would like to get rid of, particularly on popup menus.

Thanks.

I've done so on FvwmTaskBar, at least to a small degree, in another
post. At this point, I'm not sure how much is inconsistency and how much
is just misunderstanding on my part. For example, the MenuStyle line
in the system.fvwm2rc that was installed on my system was in the old
style, according to the man page. I was trying to basically get the WIN
look, with a couple of things changed. However, I couldn't figure out
the precedence, so my changes never took effect. Usually, the menu would
revert back to the default look (I presume).

Right now, I think my issues are more with an understanding of the
fundamental syntax of the config file, not the actual values in it. It's
looking more and more to me that conceptually, the config file is a bit
like Perl in that there are implied values, multiple syntaxes, shorthand
notations, etc. Is this correct? If so, that's something that's always
given me the willies, personally. I tend to like a specified way of
doing something, but that's my preference. Once I understand this, I'm
sure I'll settle on one way. Until then, it's a bit confusing.

For example, in your MenuStyle example above, what's the asterisk for?
All styles? I guess not, since that doesn't make sense, given the
context. Should it be in quotes: "*"? I've seen it that way as well here
and there. I understand about quoting values containing spaces, but how
about without them? Is there a definite order to options? Is it
case-sensitive?

What I'm thinking of would be along the lines of what we've all seen in
programming tutorials : skeleton diagrams with placeholders showing how
everything is specified, in what order, what case, with what
punctuation, what's mutually exclusive, what's dependent on each other,
etc., etc. Then some simple examples that build on each other, instead
of a massive .fvwm2rc that can walk and talk and do the jitterbug. Also,
make the examples dovetail with FAQs on how and what can be done.
Someone else mentioned what I think is a very good idea: Supply a few
different config file samples that contain the same "content", but with
a differnt look and feel (native, Win95, CDE, etc.). That way, a newbie
such as myself could see what does and doesn't change.

Just my $0.02.

There is no such version 2.6. The man pages on the web are for fvwm 2.4.x.
You seem to use 2.2.x which is very old. Of course, you should contact
the man pages matching your version. In 2.4.x both syntaxes should work,
but the one in the man page is preferable. I think +0-0 is a more correct
geometry than +0-1, but 2.2.x may have some bugs about this.

Yes, use the latest stable or unstable versions.

Yes, you may do this accurately in 2.5.1+, scan NEWS file.

In 2.4.x, you may do this too using Rectangle or Mouse hint (there are
examples in fvwm-themes), but not as accurately as in 2.5.x.

Globally, no.

If you bind a menu to a key, it altomatically selects the first selectable
menu item (and thus warps the pointer), but after working with such menu
the original pointer position is restored. It is good when you work with
keyboard only. If you bind a menu to a mouse it does not warp.

For example, in the following if you press Ctrl-Shift-F10 it warps, but
Ctrl-Shift-Mouse1 does not:

  Key F10 A CS Menu MenuFvwmRoot Rectangle 1x1+10+10 0 0
  Mouse 1 R CS Menu MenuFvwmRoot Rectangle 1x1+10+10 0 0

What exactly annoys you about menus and windows? Provide configurations.

Mikhael.

I hope when you install the version that corresponds to the man pages, the
man pages may just magically start to work. At least I hope so. :)

I would not say the syntax is fundamentally weak, i.e. supports all kinds
of errors or different ways of doing the same. In some places (usually
some exotic modules) the syntax is very unforgivable without enough error
messages. There is also a lot of backward compatibility stuff, this is
probably why you think there are several ways of doing the same.

I think the man page entry for MenuStyle (and other commands in the
"COMMANDS FOR MENUS" section) explains what asterisk means.

There are some places (usually modules, again) when you should strictly
write it without quotes or, instead, with quotes depending on what the man
page says. But for the core fvwm, the rule is usually simple. There is a
concept of word (or token). This is either something without spaces and
other delimiters or something that is in quotes (there are 3 pairs of
quotes). So, "*" and * are the same, but " *" and * are not, because
spaces are only significal when in quotes.

> Is there a definite order to options?

Do you mean the order of commands or the order of options in a command?

Almost in all cases (unless the man pages says otherwise) if a command has
multiple optional options, their order does not matter. Of course, the
order of mandatory parameters does matter. Example: the order of options
in commands Style, MenuStyle (forget the obsolete syntax of MenuStyle),
ButtonStyle, TitleStyle, WindowList, BusyCursor does not matter. If
some option in these commands is not specified there is a good default.

Some commands depend on the result of other commands, in this case the
order of commands matters. Otherwise it does not matter. Simple, no? :-)

> Is it case-sensitive?

It is preferable to stick to the case used in the man pages to be sure.
But a lot of places are case-insensitive for convenience.

Unfortunately there is a problem with who will do this.
Do you want to help with this?

But if I say you that this already exists and not only this, the
configuration is divided into logical parts, so you should compare only
these parts, not the full fvwm2rc, will this change anything?

Face it. Users are lazy (me included). If they can't read the man pages,
all other tricks suggested above will not help. Such users should just ask
on this list and they will be answered with pleasure. :)

You can ask the questions here and collect the answers.  I'm always
surprised how patiently the developers answer the same questions over
and over again (except that "after a while, all my keybindings stop
working" :-)

Questions with concrete wishes are much easier to answer than
"I fiddled with the config file for hours and it didn't work".

Hmm, I think the same table for fvwm itself would be sevaral pages
long, but I agree, it would be a good idea to have something like
that.

Well, I consider someone who knows about man and is willing to use it
no longer a real newbie :-)

Another post here raised suspicion that someone read the manpage on
the web and tried to apply it to the fvwm on his system (without
success because he uses a different version).  So maybe it would be
better to write it in HTML.  For many, it might be easier to write
something in HTML than to write a manpage.

But the format doesnt really matter, what's missing is the content!
I would vote for splitting the manpage into some kind of introduction
or a tutorial and a reference manual, but so far, only the reference
part exists.

> Please excuse my passion - it's just the passion for fvwm2.

I think we share that passion, that's why I get a bit angry when
someone complains about the manpage without giving the impression that
he is willing to do something about it.

Cheers,
Rainer

No, I don't think so.
There's only 1 shorthand in fvwm, I can think of and thats "+"
which "continues" "AddToxxx" commands.

You can either do this:

  AddToMenu Utilities Utilities Title
   + Xterm           Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
   + Rxvt            Exec  exec rxvt

or this

  AddToMenu Utilities Utilities Title
  AddToMenu Utilities Xterm           Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
  AddToMenu Utilities Rxvt            Exec  exec rxvt

Why wouldn't

MenuStyle * BorderWidth 10

make sense?  It changes the borderwidth of all menus to 10.

Older versions of fvwm used the quotes in examples,
they were never necessary, and they've
been banished from the documentation and samples for a while now.

Are you aware that you can start fvwm with no config file at all,
press F1 or any mouse button on the root window and fvwm will
offer to create a few different configurations for you?

 yes, it is mentioned in the man
 but it appears at line 365 in a very 
 modest 2 line sentence (context: .fvwm2rc).  
 it is repeated in a somewhat more extended 
 version at ~1100 (Built in K&M Bindings).

 - mention this also in one of the INSTALL and/or 
 README files (e.g. README.sysrc).

Welcome to *nix

I think the man page should remain as it is.
The man page format is standard.

Man page _is_ a reference. Man page _is not_ a
tutorial. Will never be.

If you are impatient and newbie in the same time
the chances of screwing things up are big, so
my advice is to start with a configuration file
that _works_ and modify it to suit your needs,

I think somebody wrote a tutorial for fvwm.
Use it.

Good luck

It was hard to write, therefore it should be hard to learn, right? ;-)
This kind of attitude worked for a long time when there weren't
alternatives (at least perceived if not in reality). However, in today's
market, as much as we (I?) sometimes dislike it, the customer deserves
some consideration. Even in free software it helps.

I wish KDE / Gnome and others would include (more) man pages instead of
all the (*&#%$ HTML documentation.

I agree - However some explantory text/refernce material might be in
order here and there, whether in the man page or as a separate document.

Well, since I started this thread let me say that I am not new to
computers, nor am I totally new to *nix -- I use and administer Solaris
every day at work in a decent sized production environment and have done
so for almost 4 years. I'm certainly not a guru (I learn every day), but
not a Unix newbie either... an fvwm newbie, certainly, though!

> Use it.

The only one I've found is a bit thin. What's there is useful enough,
but it's not much (as the author freely admits).

Hi,

is it possible to restrict the region, where FVWM places new windows and to 
which windows are maximised (in order to save some space at the borders for the 
GNOME panels)?

Thanks in advance

Matthias

Short version: I'd like FvwmPager to _not_ draw its own PagerDisplay
window in the pager view. Is there a way to achieve this?
I'm using fvwm 2.4.8. from the Debian distribution.

Long version: I use a large grid of desks and like to see them all at
once in the pager when navigating between desks, hence the pager view is
quite big, practically fuillscreen. Normally, I have the PagerDisplay
iconified, effectively hidden since I don't display icons, and deiconify
it (and make it topmost) on demand via a hotkey for navigation. I then
navigate using Alt+cursor-keys, the PagerDisplay being sticky hence
remaining on-screen. Unfortunately, in the pager view, the PagerDisplay
window then always obscures the current desk. This is a bit annoying,
somewhat as if the text cursor in a text editor would always obscure the
current character under the cursor. Since there isn't much use anyway

I  was making a benevolent suggestion, what i thought would/could
help some people.  
  It was not about any kind of tutorial, but only about putting 
a piece of information (that is already in the manual) somewhere 
at the begining, where people reading the man the first time can 
easily spot it.
  I was also not suggesting to change the (holy) Format either.
But i can't fail to note here, that the standard does not seem to be 
that very strictly defined - see man of man:

"  A manual page consists of several parts.
  They may be labelled NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, FILES,
       SEE ALSO, BUGS, and AUTHOR."

Please note: MAY be labelled.


So i don't really understand your rather harsh tone.
Could you explain?

The "To the Impatient" was meant to have a pinch of

Yes, in 2.5.x see the EWMHBaseStrut description in the man page.
But there maybe temporary problems with it when MinOverlapPlacement used.

I don't have the latest GNOME and KDE, but I would think their panels and
maybe other apps should have options for window managers to reserve them
the desktop space using EWMH hints. In this case EWMHBaseStrut is not
needed, since FVWM by default respects these hints.

Mikhael.

You can't do this in 2.4.8.

In 2.5.x, use:

  *FvwmPager: UseSkipList

Then all WindowListSkip windows are not shown in the pager, like:

  Style FvwmPager WindowListSkip

I'm using FvwmTaskBar, with no RootMenu configured, but rather all the
same entries on the StartMenu. It pops up just fine when I click the
task bar button, but the position is relative to the mouse pointer, not
to the task bar. That's what I'm trying to achieve. I'm currently
running 2.4.6, BTW (latest RPM for RedHat 7.x I could locate in a quick
search). Here's what I've tried to pin down the location:

AddToMenu StartMenu Root x y SelectInPlace

...where x and y are various offsets. I would expect x to be 0 and y to
basically be height_of_root_window - height_of_menu - height_of_taskbar.
In this intance, referencing the lower left corner of the menu would
have been more convenient and less prone to change, although menu's
typically _do_ drop down, so I see the value in the upperleft reference
point.  Trouble is, it doesn't seem to make any difference at all what I
put there - Nothing ever changes. My MenuStyle is :

MenuStyle * Foreground black, Background grey70, Greyed grey90,\
 HilightBack grey60, ActiveFore black, Hilight3DThickness -1, \
 font -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, Animation,\
 PopupDelay 55, PopdownDelay 5, TitleWarpOff, SeparatorsLong,\
 TrianglesRelief, PopupOffset 0 95

...with the exception that it's actually all on one line. It works as
expected, but is something there interfering?
 
> What exactly annoys you about menus and windows? Provide configurations.

It's just that I prefer the mouse pointer to stay where it is when I
click it. In general, I'm not a big fan of anything in the UI
"responding" or taking any kind of action without an explicit
instruction on the part of the user. I'd rather not even have the menu
selection move with the mouse without the button being down, given a
choice, and I don't care for "highlighting" icons that change as you
mouseover them (so popular in Windows, Gnome, KDE, etc.), but that's
just my personal GUI preferences. I like intefaces that are totally
static until acted upon by the user. Once again, just my preference.
Even under Windows, I don't turn on the option to jump to the active
control. With those sort of things active, I tend to spend more time
looking for the mouse pointer. The way I have it now, I have no warping
happening, at least none I've noticed, so I'm happy with that.

Let me clarify something - I may have inadvertently come across as
critical of fvwm and the way things are done. That was not intentional,
but rather just the product of frustration (indeed, I even stated such
in one post). I usually never write when in such a state, as I always
regret it later. I'll state again: I like what I'm learning of fvwm and
I'm appreciative of the help; it's just that the learning process is
somewhat painful at times (at least, it smarts here and there...).

You are adding the position hint to the wrong command.  It only
works with the "Menu" and "Popup" commands.  This is because it's
a parameter of a specific menu invocation, not of the menu as a
whole.  Try this instead:

  *FvwmTaskBarStartMenu RootMenu root +0p o100-25p SelectInPlace

FvwmTaskBar passes the whole string with "Menu" prepended to fvwm.
It's really not the most intuitive syntax I could make up.

You can split it into multiple lines for readability as long as
the mwm or fvwm menu style appears as the first item of the list
(as both override most settings):


  MenuStyle * Foreground black, Background grey70, Greyed grey90
  MenuStyle * HilightBack grey60, ActiveFore black

That's mostly a relic of the "fvwm" menu style.  I never
understood why it had to be so annoying, but we never changed it
fpr backward compatibility.  The first menu style everybody may
want to use is

  MenuStyle * mwm

which corrects most of the funny behaviour.

You're welcome.  I know the documentation isn't good for
beginners.  As someone else pointed out, being a developer
disqualifies me for writing a tutorial.  That again brings us back
to the issue that we need a volunteer to write and maintain such a
guide.

Hi,

if i start an application and quit it (immediatelly - e.g.
briefly looking at an image, etc) the focus is not returned 
to the parent window, the focus seems to be undefined (i.e. no 
window selected).

I use ClickToFocus and GrabFocus.

Which version or snapshot are you using?  This works fine with
2.5.3.

I think a separate document will be better.
As someone wrote on this list, the man page 
is too big allready.

Sorry again. :-) 
Many new users which come from windows don't read 
documentation so I thought you are one of those.

My apologies, but i'm became sick of seeing windoze
 lusers who can't configure their pc saying that
*nix is hard to learn, when the only thing they 
have read in their life was the label from the OK
button in a dialog box.

I found the examples distributed with the source a 
good start. Maybe I'll try to write an extensive
 tutorial. I'm not an expert but with some help I
think I can do it. 
The main problem are the differences between 
versions of fvwm

That's the problem with man pages: the references
are at the end, usually :-)
There was a good manual viewer (X11 based) which
was acting like a browser (i.e. you had a TOC at the
beginning and when you pressed the word on that TOC 
the program took you right to the place where it was
 in the manual.) but it seems it's not on the net
anymore.

I saw some man pages which were written some kind 
backwards: Name , Synopsys, Description (very long
-literature), Options (command options), real
description of options (after a couple of pages).

I don't want to read man pages where the options 
of command are after ten pages of scrolling.

A tutorial has many literature (by literature
underestanding the part that tells to users 
what's a pager, what's a taskbar and other similar
things.)

Well, the man manpage is not the authorative source for
information about man page formats.  For Linux, there is the
Linux Man Page Howto.  Of course this isn't authorative either,
but the "standard" we use for fvwm.

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

I would like to conditionally override any window's position when it
first appears, to bring into full view any window that comes up "too
low" (i.e., partially obscured by the Task Bar, which I have on
Layer 6).  ManualPlacement is not an option in this case.

FvwmEvent sees both new and user-moved windows as a
"configure_window" event.  (I trapped for, but never saw, an
"add_window" event.)  "PlacedByFvwm" is false on a new window if the
app has its own ideas about position.  Is there another
discriminator I can use?

Hi,
I'd like to simply start my session with a FvwmIconMan on my screen.
However, it appears always in the upper left corner. (It is not
swallowed into FvwmButtons.) How do I place it elsewhere?

Nothing of the following was successful (these values are just to test
it):

*FvwmIconMan: Geometry 100x100+50+50
FvwmIconMan -geometry 100x100+50+50
Style FvwmIconMan Geometry 100x100+50+50

?

You could try reading the manpage of FvwmIconMan or just search it for
"geometry".  I admit it's not very clear, but at least it tells you
that "Geometry" is not a valid option, while "buttongeometry" and
"managergeometry" are.

Of course, reading a manpage can be dangerous, because you might spend
hours trying all the fancy configurable things you discover in it :-)
So, to protect you from this danger, here are the relevant lines of my
config:

*FvwmIconMan*managergeometry	1x0+0+272
*FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry	193x0

Disclaimer: The syntax is obsolete, because I still use 2.2 at work,
and didn't bother to update the fvwm2rc on my laptop running 2.4.
I didn't want to tell you something I haven't tested myself.

Hope this helps,
Rainer

The add_window event should do it. Please provide the config that traps
this event and does not work for you.

Yes, the reference chart is a good overview. But the detailed
description of geometry stuff is not very helpful.

The description of 'managergeometry' doesn't mention the option of
positioning, the 'default 1x0' in 'Configurations Options Ref. Chart'
leads the reader also into the opposite direction, and, third, the new
term 'managergeometry' (in comparison to 'geometry') made me think that
something is different - and I interpreted it that position was not a
suitable attribute here.

I don't think you're stupid neighter, so you'll know that there's no
time for everyone to be into everything ;-) I hope that those who
administrate the current man page will decide if to improve this aspect.

I am discussing general ideas about better documentation in another
forum right now.

That works great - Thanks. Well...actually, I changed the 25 to 21,

Once again - It's not so much that I find it "actively" annoying, but

You don't use conditional commands for this, since this is useless,
You listen to the new_page event using, for example, FvwmEvent.

FvwmBacker may help too depending on what you want to do.

A small addition. FvwmBacker has a built-in support for checking for a
specific page, but if you want to use FvwmEvent you do need PipeRead.

Checking for what page it is changing to, right? Sometimes I'd like 
to know additionally what page it is changing *from*.

I might be able to throw some light on it, at least for Red Hat's `error'. By
coincidence, I was last night looking at the spec file for Red Hat's
fvwm2.4.6, and also for fvwm2.2.4. I was amazed to see ``--enable-multi-byte''
in the 2.*2*.4 version -- I had thought the multi-byte option only appeared
experimentally in 2.4. Then I saw a patch file that Red Hat had added to their
2.2.4 RPM, to support multi-byte in 2.2.4 (and possibly earlier versions too).

This patch may have been contributed to or from the fvwm-developers at the
time: e.g. perhaps it was an early version of what appeared in 2.4? Anyway,
clearly Red Hat discarded the patch file in their 2.4 RPM, as I assume it
would not have matched anymore.

So Red Hat simply failed to switch *off* multi-byte support when it, in
effect, *became* experimental -- perhaps a careless oversight, or perhaps an
optimistic perspective, but not quite as looney as if they switched it *on*
for the first time, like I had assumed.

Maybe it's related to their apparent intentions of support for fvwm, i.e.
taking their eye off an old ball before letting it drop?

Speaking of such, the reason I was looking at these old specs was because I
was building a Red Hat ready fvwm2.5.2 RPM which we are probably going to use
here at Manchester CS. I know there are RPMS on SourceForge, but they're not
actually Red Hat ready (i.e. literally plug and play on a standard RH7
system). So I started off from Red Hat's own 2.4.6 spec file. I will probably
build a 2.5.3 one too. Is it worth me putting them on the web?

My own `newbie' experience years ago was a burning baptism, rather than a
gentle drift into expertise. So this question is to others, expecially recent
newbies. A tutorial document has been suggested. Would it be useful to have
one that helps a new user build ``their own'' simple .fvwm2rc from almost
scratch, without wholesale importing of any ready made themes or bits of
configuration?

Each FVWM feature would be explained, as the user includes it into their
config, and they could run FVWM at various stages as it develops. They would
start off from a known place: a really simple config that contains only emacs,
or another editor of their choice (nedit?), a restart menu item, and perhaps a
program runnign to monitor the error output from FVWM (e.g. the error monitor
from AnotherLevelUp). This initial config would be explained in the first
section. Next sections would give step by step instructions for adding more
features. Later sections would tell them what is wanted, but get them to find
out how to do it from the man pages, and try it first with FvwmConsole before
adding it to their file, etc..

It would cover the sort of things that newbies want to do: choose a
background, get an xterm on the menu, choose window frame features, have a
task bar, have multiple desk tops,have some fvwm buttons, ... Is this a
sensible sort of order? Perhaps it could evolve through it's readers
sugegsting what things they want to do next.

By the end the student of fvwm (!) would have basically copied a simple
config, but feel able to risk being creative. Maybe some exercises could be
suggested for further learning.

Does such a thing already exist? Would it be welcome? I'm not quite on the
verge of volnteering to think about writing something...

Then you should keep the variable to store the old one.
Something like the following in the event handler function:

  PipeRead ' do something with $[OLD_PAGE_NX] and $[OLD_PAGE_NY] '
  # save the current page for the next event
  SetEnv OLD_PAGE_NX $[page.nx]
  SetEnv OLD_PAGE_NY $[page.ny]

If you really need such non-trivial functionality, you may consider to
write a small module in perl listening to M_NEW_PAGE and doing the work.

Mikhael.

Hi. I think I have just noticed a bug which I believe might be explained as
follows. In fvwm 2.4.8, when the start button is activated, the menu is run
with no window context, and so any window operations cause the user to first
pick a window. This is good. In fvwm 2.5.{2,3} when the start button is
activated, the menu is run with the taskbar itself as the window context. This
is not good. The up shot is, when say a move operation is chosen from the
start menu in 2.5, it is the task bar that gets moved ! :-)

I recall in some of the early 2.2.x versions, the start menu was invoked with
an illegal window context, which caused FVWM to crash if a window operation
was invoked via it. I suggested a patch at the time to fix it to have the root
window as focus, and sumbitted that to fvwm and to Red Hat. This is probably a
coincidence, but you never know... :-)

Best wishes, John Latham

No, this was broken since 2.5.1, I think.
Fixed in cvs.

On my Mac 8500/120 MHz 2.5.3 takes about 30 minutes to compile.
Not bad with 32 MB RAM!
But X got to go when compiling.
And the 2.4.6 in Cygwin is allright, I think.

I agree with that "compile from the sources".
I am writing this on a Mac 8500/120 using 2.5.3 CVS.
And yes, under LinuxPPC - what else! :)

Don't do that!  It's not even alpha quality.

Hi all,

I decided to upgrade to 2.5.3 for the PNG support.

I'm assuming I can do stuff like this now:

AddToMenu "Multimedia@gtcd.png@" "MuLTiMeDia" Title
+ ...

but I get an error:

[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't load image from gtcd.png

The 'scanForPixmap' looks ominous. Can anyone help me out? Is there
some docco on png support anywhere?

yes, I did compile in PNG support.

DeePBLue>> grep PNG config.h
#define HAVE_PNG 1

Are you sure you have the correct ImagePath?
You may always specify the full file name, like /my/images/gtcd.png.

Can you view this image using some image viewer?

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

Thanks for the quick reply.

> Are you sure you have the correct ImagePath?

yup, my .png images are stored with all my .xpm images.

DeePBLue>> grep ImagePath .fvwm2rc 
ImagePath    $HOME/images/icons

> You may always specify the full file name, like /my/images/gtcd.png.

hmmm, well using an absolute path worked! Does 'ImagePath' only
apply to xpms? Is there a 'PNGPath' or similar?

DeePBLue>> grep yellowStar menu 
+    "&CoNTRoL%yellowStar.png%"        Exec exec rxvt -e aumix &
+    "&Testing%/home/deepblue/scott/images/icons/yellowStar.xpm%"        Nop

In the above test I did, I got no image next to 'CoNTRoL', but
I *did* get the image next to 'Testing' ... go figure ...

SCoTTie :)

No, just one ImagePath for all the image files.

Just tested, everything works for me.

Well, if you have these lines exactly, it means you have yellowStar.xpm,
but not yellowStar.png. Or you don't have png support compiled in.
Or ImagePath is incorrect. Or you run the wrong fvwm executable. :)
Or there is some problem with your png library if it can't load the image.

There is also a small change for a bug somewhere, but until you make it
reproducible using a minimal config and 1-2 pngs, nothing can be done.

Mikhael.

Hm, not very helpful.  The Picture library doesn't provide any
information about the reason why it could not load the file.
Unless we're missing something obvious we have to add debug
statements to libs/Picture.c and the subordinate functions.

Bugger! My mistake - I had yellowStar.png in another subdirectory.

You'd think after 3 years of playing with fvwm I could've nutted it out!

Still, thanks so much for your help.

Hi,

I have the following keys defined in my config file

Key Left        A       M       GotoDesk -1
Key Right       A       M       GotoDesk +1

and usually these work, but with OpenOffice, I'm finding that they don't.

Does anyone have an idea why with this particular application they should
fail?

Thanks,

Tom

Ps. I'm using fvwm 2.4.7

Hi all,

I've had this problem for a while & thought upgrading to 2.5.3
would fix it. In short, the background of 'SidePic' is not rendered
when I invoke WindowList from the Keyboard (but it works fine if it's
invoked from the Mouse).

Best illustrated with a simple .fvwm2rc:

deepblue% cat .fvwm/.fvwm2rc 
ImagePath $HOME/images/icons
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 255 2 darkgray 50 MidnightBlue 50 white
MenuStyle * SidePic happy.xpm
Mouse 3 R A WindowList
# Alt-Tab is set up in ConfigFvwmDefaults as:
# Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
Mouse 2 R A WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
Key F2 A M WindowList

Note: you will need to put happy.xpm (or substitute) in ImagePath.

press Mouse 2 or 3 & works fine.
press Alt-F2 or Alt-Tab ... not so good.

SCoTTie :)

The same hapens with Gnome.  It's pretty annoying, and I have no
idea how some applications manage to do this.  Fvwm grabs the key
combinations on the root window and any further grabs by the
applications should fail.  Yet, they still manage to do this.

I've had the occasional strange problem with my key bindings.  Sometimes they
just stop working (all of them, that is).  It's a little annoying; I'll press
my alt-f1 or f2 to raise/lower a window, or alt-left to go to my left desktop,
and it just won't work!  They just stop working entirely.  I'm using Gnome 1.4
(but no nautilus managing the desktop) and fvwm 2.5.1.  Is this related to the
above problem?  I have to quit X entirely and restart it to get my bindings
back again.

Or just press the num-lock key again ;-)  See question 0.1 in the

I don't know Sam.  Are you sure none of your num-lock or scroll-lock keys
are pressed?

For me, I can move my cursor over the root window or any other window and
my key bindings for switching pages return (I use focuss follows mouse),
so it's really a question of the application getting in the way.

Dominik, one thing I have noticed is that it does not occur like this all
of the time.  Sometimes my key bindings work, while other times they
don't.  It seems to be related to where the program is in handling
switching modes, or saving...  basically whether it is accepting input.
Unfortunately, it seems a bit tricky to make it occur on will.

Silly question...  Could it be the focus policy?  Sometimes it seems as if
no window has focus.  Can this occur, and will fvwm cope properly?

Thanks,

Tom

Hm, so the application seems to have grabbed the key on its window
and fvwm has grabbed it everywhere else.  I have to look this up
in the X manuals.

It may be important if you start OpenOffice first or fvwm.  After
an fvwm restart things may look very differently.  In X it's just
first come - first serve:  whoever requests the grab first gets
it.

No, that has nothing to do with it.  Focus policy affects only
mouse button handling.

Well, I can add a little more information.

OpenOffice contains a tool called Impress (You know star office 6.0...).
The problem with loosing key binding occurs after switching back from
a full screen presentation or slide show view to normal editing view.

The open office window will respond to mouse clicks, though some of its
functionality is lost i.e. some of the menu items do nothing.

Does this suggest any more ideas on what might be causing this problem?

Thanks,

Tom

OpenOffice contains a tool called Impress (You know star office 6.0...).
The problem with loosing key binding occurs after switching back from
a full screen presentation or slide show view to normal editing view.

The open office window will respond to mouse clicks, though some of its
functionality is lost i.e. some of the menu items do nothing.

Does this suggest any more ideas on what might be causing this problem?

Thanks,

Tom

Sorry for inundating you folks, but this is a funny thing.

One more observation:

After going to slide-show view and returning, the main Open Office window
has focus.  However, there are "sub-windows" which only exist within the
Open Office main window, but do not have focus.  By simply moving my mouse
to the border or title bar of the window focus is restored for all windows.

Oh, sorry I forgot to mention...  My key bindings for switching pages
return as soon as my mouse touches the border or title bar of the main
open office window.

So, this problem does appear to be connected to focus somehow.

Does this help?

Tom

I can't decide whether your are advising using 2.5.3, or 2.4.9 instead! :-)

2.5.2 does *seem* very stable. I have used it everyday since early July, and
it has not crashed. :-) All (certainly most) of the ~700 users will be using
the same configuration package as I have been using, i.e. AnotherLevelUp
(otherwise it would be a little dangerous, I agree). I have added a patch to
fix the task bar start button context problem I reported yesterday (thanks for
fixing in CVS, Mikhael). The most persuasive motive for using 2.5 rather than
2.4 is it's extra features that *might* help in the desperate war against the
Java/FVWM mismatch -- which has reached critical status now that all our
undergraduates write so much Java.... :-(

Meanwhile, I have switched to using 2.5.3 personally -- so far so good. I have
probably got about 3 weeks to try 2.5.3 and use that instead if there have
been no serious problems.

My current reasoning is this: 2.5.2 was alpha last month, and the problems
found in it since did not screw up AnotherLevelUp. Now, 2.5.3 is alpha, but it
has not been tested with AnotherLevelUp for a month! Maybe the problems in
2.5.3 will screw up AnotherLevelUp -- I'll let you know if they do, but while
I find out, 2.5.2 is actually a safer bet!!!!

Of course, I'll have RPMS for 2.4.[6-9] up my sleeve in case the worst should
happen.

hello,

since i use alt+cursor_keys for virtual desktop navigation, i wondered
if it is possible to have the FvwmPager appear/disappear on
press/release of the alt key.  yet my attempts didn't really work,
-transient only makes the pager disappear when pressing Alt_L (or
whatever key specified) again.  is there some way to make this work?
would be a nice feature, imo.

thanks in advance,

This is probably one for Dominic...

You may recall a few weeks ago you fixed a bug in the menus when they have a
HGradient -- certain menu items left `up' after scanning over them? It works
much better now in 2.5.3, thanks very much, but I have noticed one little
imperfection that I didn't notice before. Say you put the pointer on a menu
item which causes a sub-menu to pop up. Then move the pointer up one place.
The sub-menu is cleared away, however, it also wipes off the bottom edge of
the 3D `up' relief of the item at the new pointer position (i.e. what was the
top of the 3D relief of the previous position). This `absent bottom' feature
is disabled if there is a NOP between the two items.

Here is a bit of ascii art in case my description is not clear.

-> marks pointer position

 I* are menu items

 --
[..] is 3d 1up' effect

Before:

	 I1

	 I2
	 --
->	[I3] -> Sub-menu
	 --
	 I4

Then move the pointer up one place.

After:

	 I1
	 --

	 I3
	 
	 I4

After reading section 3.3 of the FAQ, I'm just curious if anyone has 
discovered a way to make fvwm do Alt-Tab switch to the last window 
(Windoze style), instead of the current window; it's a small thing, but 
it's much nicer to have that than the default alt-tab-tab switching.  If 
not, I guess consider that a feature request...

Hi,

I would like to know whether it is possible or not to bind one key of a
customized keyboard to the feature of switching all the virtual screens =
of
my system... I'm in a hurry and have got lost in the manual pages...

Thanks you all in advance and best regards,

This is a FAQ, question 7.12. Instead of using what this answer says,
you might try the following:

AddToFunc TogglePager   "I" None (FvwmPager) Module FvwmPager * *
+                       "I" Next (FvwmPager) Close

Key     F1      A       C       TogglePager

As my pager is sticky and always on top, I don't need the other lines
(in the answer to Q7.12).

Regards,
Uli

For the benefit of other recent arrivals to Fvwm2 - who are equally
dismayed by the size (and number) of the relevant man pages:

Typing on the command line "info fvwm2" loads the man page and all the
routines (emacs bindings, I believe) for reading an info file.

This can lighten the reading load (yet to be tried).

There is also a vim plugin for loading the man page into vim and then
use the features of vim (e.g. search, mark, fold, etc) to make the
reading of the man page less daunting (tried it and it works).

Hi,
I just found a program that might help askers of
FAQ 3.5: You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
    presses?

http://hoopajoo.net/projects/xautomation.html
 Control X from the command line for scripts, and do "visual scraping"
to find things on the screen. The conrol interface allows mouse
movement, clicking, button up/down, key up/down, etc, and uses the XTest
extension so you don't have the annoying problems that xse has when apps
ignore sent events. The visgrep program find images inside of images and
reports the coordinates, allowing progams to find buttons, etc, on the
screen to click on.

Have fun,
sa

with a recent fvwm version you can do this:
    Key Tab A M WindowList CurrentAtEnd
to get the desired effect.

Don't feel stupid.  You'll notice that's question 0.1 in the
FAQ... there's a reason for that after all :).

Do you want to disable Ctrl-Alt-F1 and similar keys to switch to virtual
consoles? If yes, this should be done in X, not FVWM.

Or do you want to simulate Ctrl-Alt-F1 with a different key?
It is possible by calling something like "sudo switchto 1".

When you are in virtual consoles, you may press Alt-Left, Alt-Right.
So, you may bind (after configuring sudo) Alt-Left to:

  Key Left A M Exec sudo switchto 6

Then Alt-Left will circulate between all VCs if this is what you want.
Anyway, this is not really related to FVWM.

Mikhael.

(and since your pager is not CirculateSkip, otherwise you also need
CirculateHit.)

This does not solve the original request: to close transient pager on the
Alt release instead of the next Alt press. This is not currently possible.

Multibyte should be enabled in 2.4.x only for a CJK language.
Unfortunately, the code is not perfect.
We have rewrite the "locale" code in 2.5.x.

Hi,

the problem is that I don't have any usual PC-keyboard, I've got a =
home-made
keyboard with just few keys... I don't have and Alt, AltGr, Control, =
etc.
key (just Shift and Cpas Lock)... So I have my own map file for console =
(I
bind the keycode to Incr_Console)... so I tried to bind that key to
Next_Virtual_Screen within my xmodmap file for X, but I doesn't work... =
So I
am trying some workaround from FVWM.

Thank you very much for your help, Mikhael

I see the problem now.  To prevent overwhelming the complex function that
I use for Cmd (which has a couple of PipeReads in it), I put "Delay 1" in
my configuration.  Without the Delay, a new window generates both
"add_window" and "configure_window" events.  With the Delay,
"configure_window" always arrives first, so the "add_window" never
appears.  Is this expected?

I need to handle new and user-moved windows with different complex
functions.  I suppose I could set up two separate FvwmEvent instances to
trap each of the two events.  Is there a more CPU-efficient approach?
