Not really, but nobody ever noticed.  The window size gets
configured first before the add_window message is sent.

It's just triggered by similar circumstances.  I bet OpenOffice
has grabbed the key combinations over its window and somehow
manages to override fvwm's global grab.  As soon as the pointer
leaves the client window, the fvwm grabs become 'active' again.

I don't have the time to debug that right now, but it's certainly
on my to do list.

Don't let perceived stability fool you.  You just haven't
triggered the buggy or crashing parts.  That's fine for you as an
individual, but don't underestimate the creativity of 700 users.
Oh, and bugs that were introduced and fixed in the development
versions *don't* show up in the NEWS, only in the ChangeLog.

Furthermore, *if* you stumble across a problem that is really bad,
you may be forced to upgrade to a version that's very unstable.
Right now I'm planning to rewrite major parts of the menu loop,
the builtin command interface and the main event loop - three of
fvwm's most central parts.

Just to make this clear:  No 2.5.x release was 'alpha' quality
yet.  Being 'alpha' means that it is good enough to consider
heading for a stable release after extensive tests have been done.
That's why it's called a 'development release' in the NEWS.

   I had been using 2.5.3 but had a lot of problems with the mouse
   and drop down menus and switched back to 2.5.2. Typically if I'm
   above an xterm (say) and move the mouse rapidly up and down a root
   drop down menu, eventually it looses the menu and highlights the
   xterm. I have a dual processor 2.1Ghz  motherboard so I don't think
   its some kind of a speed issue, but I also have a tiny usb mouse,
   and it zips all over the screen.

   Bruce.

I have recently switched from 2-2.5 to 2.5.2, since when I have
noticed a new, intermittent problem with my icon managers. They
normally display with sunken lines separating each item, but the lines
sometimes disappear, leaving a plain grey rectangle containing the
window names. This happens in both horizontal and vertical
managers. Obviously this isn't a serious bug, but it is mildly
irritating. I include my settings below, which I haven't changed since
my upgrade.

This is not a bug, but a feature. In 2.3.x a new button context was added
iconbutton with the flat relief by default. I don't know whether this
default is good, I myself would not use flat. Anyway, just add this line
(see the man page if needed):

  *FvwmIconMan: iconbutton up black SeaShell3

Thanks for the swift response. Your suggested fix seems to have done
the trick, although it's still not clear to me why the `bug' appeared
to be intermittent.

Ah. On the FVWM home page it says:

	Latest Alpha Release:  2.5.3

which I must admit has coloured my thinking a bit.

Thank you for the very sobering warning. *If* we go with 2.5 it will be
monitored very carefully and we will fall straight back to 2.4.x if we have
problems.

But I suspect it is easy for you to underestimate the dire pain already caused
by the Java/FVWM mismatches!!!! (It's also easy to overestimate our users'
creativity -- more to the pity!!) I'll weigh up the 2.4 Java weapons with the
2.5 ones. I've just noticed that the one I thought might be the most helpful,
ResizeHintOverride actually is already there in 2.4 -- for some reason I
thought it was only in 2.5. (I am hoping this will help combat the quite
common but appalling 1x1, modal, nonresizable dialog ``feature''!!!!)

Doh.  When the web site is updated the next time it will read
"very unstable" instead of "alpha".

Hi,

I have some problem with transient windows, e.g. in netscape (4.79), also
in java applications.

If I have some transients started from the application the transients sometimes manage
to get behind the main window. For Netscape e.g.:
Netscape -> Settings -> Cache -> Cache Directory. You'll get the main window and
two transients. The problem is: If I click on the title bar from the main netscape
window the second transient (the file-browser) goes behind netscape, while
the first transient (the settings window) stays in front of the main window.
Since netscape wants to have something in the file browser the rest of the windows
are unusable, and the one that's usable is hidden by the others. So I want to have
the file browser before the main window regardless of what I'm doing, or better: all
transients in front of the main window.

Is there any fvwm function that I missed to avoid this? Or do I have to look somewhere
else to get this?

BTW, I use fvwm 2.4.6, 2.4.9 shows the same effect.
In fvwm2rc I have the following things that (AFAIK) refer to transients:
MenuStyle * mwm
Style *  MWMButtons, MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style * DecorateTransient
Style * RaiseTransient
Style * LowerTransient
Style * StackTransientParent

Regards,

Josef

1)  I am at this point using 2.5.2 more or less because I have to.
    I used a very early version of fvmw for years with no problems
    and then upgraded to xwindows 4.2 which caused significant problems
    with the mouse-menu interaction. An upgrade to fvwm-2.4.8 did not
    solve the problems whereas the alpha version fvwm-2.5.2 did. I've
    used fvwm-2.5.2 for a while now and for my use it works fine.
    With fvwm-2.5.3 the problems started again.

2)  It looks like the following are not getting execute permission
    when installed. For instance:
        sh-2.05b# fvwm-bug
        sh: /usr/local/bin/fvwm-bug: Permission denied
    A chmod fixes it.

   fvwm-bug
   fvwm-config
   fvwm-convert-2.4
   fvwm-convert-2.6
   fvwm-menu-desktop
   fvwm-menu-directory
   fvwm-menu-headlines
   fvwm-menu-xlock
   fvwm-perllib

3) I built with the following configure options
       --enable-debug-msgs
       --enable-command-log
   and it builds fine but I don't understand where the messages
   get piped to. syslogd? an fvwm console?

I think your short description (in another thread) is not enough to
understand the problem. Please add more details to that message.
What is the "mouse-menu" problem and what to do exactly to reproduce it.

Seems unlikely to me that they are installed without a+x.
Please do the following:

  #cd fvwm_installation_dir
  cd bin/
  make uninstall  # as root
  make
  make install  # as root

Then send the output of "make install" and "ls -l /usr/local/bin/fvwm-*".

This depends on how you start the fvwm executable. If you call it in
~/.xinitrc without redirection to a file, the output will be together
with the X output, possibly on your virtual console.

Display managers like xdm/gdm/kdm may redirect the output to a file.

I don't think these debugging options are very useful to you, the output
is noisy and hides the real error messages that may appear on stderr.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There is little you can do about it.  Transients of transients are
a very rare case.  Back when we wrote that code we felt it wasn't
worth to take care of that case as it requires a whole lot more
work (on the machine) to do.  If it's a problem I'll eventually
get around to implement it.

Could you try with my latest patch?  I couldn't reproduce this

Thanks, now I know that I don't have to search for it any further. :-(

I think that multiple transients from one main window are used, while
they are indeed rare. Example is netscape, I think that there are other
examples that pop up a transient prompting for something, and if you
enter something wrong they pop up an additional transient
telling that. That's the problem with the java application I noted above

I have users that manage to get the second transient behind the main window,
and then they think that the application crashed. I already activated to show
transients in the fvwmtaskbar, but it seems that's not enough. 

So it would be nice to have some function that keeps the transients before
the main window.

Regards,

Josef

Well, you could put these windows on a higher layer, but you have
to do it manually for each one:

If a solution to the 1x1 presents itself, please post it.  We've been fighting this
one in 2.4.7 (and prior to that, under fvwm95 for many years).  It seems to happen
more frequently if the CPU is under load.

I am not using neither FvwmIconMan nor FvwmIconBox. Is there any way in 
fvwm2 to create a simple framing window around each individual icon in a 
similar way as MWM does ? Hitting the .xpm icons with transparent 
portions is sometimes a tricky task.

Um, actually after reading the man page again I found out that
this is already implemented.  Use

  Maximize true grow 0

and

  Maximize true 0 grow

I may or may not be having a similar problem, though i am running
HEAD as of this afternoon (i've seen this ever since i switched
back to Fvwm a few weeks ago).  When viewing
<http://daemonnews.org/> with Mozilla, my title bar displays the
'ae' character without trouble, but IconMan just shows a question
mark.

I use the following fonts:

Style * Font "xft:Verdana:size=8;fixed"
*FvwmIconMan: font "xft:Verdana:size=10;fixed"

Same font, just different sizes.  I'm guessing something is being
run through iconv in one place but not the other, but that's just
a guess.

This is exactly what the author does not like (read the third paragraphs).

In the private message to me Imre said that what he needed is user window
states to allocate 2 states for vertical and horizontal maximization and
if-else syntax.

Hi,

how can I hide / change color of the border of the IconMan when NOTHING
is in it? In other words: As long as I have some windows open or
minimized the IconMan doesn't show a border (since my background is
black, too), but if there is NO window the icon man shows a 2 pixel
border in brown color...

Here is how I configure man IconMan:

Style FvwmIconMan BorderWidth 0, NoTitle, NoHandles NeverFocus,
 FixedPosition, IgnoreRestack, StaysOnBottom

Style FvwmIconMan Color black/black

*FvwmIconMan: title ""


Bye
 Felix

Do you have the pb with 
	*FvwmIconMan: font "xft:Verdana:size=8;fixed"
?

Note that the font loaded depends on the version of xft.

Maybe

Search for "titlebutton" in the FvwmIconMan man page. Something like:

  *FvwmIconMan: titlebutton flat

Hello,

I'm using `de_DE.UTF-8' locale and compiled FVWM 2.4.9 with multibyte
support. What I got is that I see nothing in WindowList, just empty
lines, and I see garbage in FvwmPager windows thumbnails. Balloons there
are also empty. But when a window has a title with Cyrillic letters it
is displayed correctly, though German umlauts aren't (a header
containing umlauted letters is not displayed at all).

Without multibyte support instead of Cyrillic titles I get garbage
there.

Before I used FVWM 2.2.5 from Red Hat 7.2 distribution (with the same
locale) and everything was okay.

Btw, I get the following kind of messages from FVWM:

If so, just don't specify --enable-multibyte and you should see the
same results in 2.4.9.

On the other hand I don't know what patches RedHat added to 2.2.5.

It is hard to say anything concrete without knowing details, like whether
an application specifies titles in utf8 or koi8-r. And which fonts
you use in modules and decorations.

Also try the 2.5.3 rpms to see whether you have different results.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I tried this but this way I get garbage in window headers if they
contain symbols outside of ASCII and they do it often. ;-(

My locale is everywhere set to utf8, and I don't think there is an
application that would read `de_DE.UTF-8' and provide title in koi8-r.
Mask for fonts everywhere contains iso10646. They same was when I used
2.2.5.

Thanks for the advice I'll try this.

yes, but I am having a little problem that I have to figure out first.

I define the following, which should work, but when I push F6 for mouse
up I dont get a mouse up :-(.
Key F5 A A exec xte 'mousedown 1'
Key F6 A A exec xte 'mouseup 1'

however If I define this:
Key F7 A A exec xte 'mousedown 1' && sleep 10 && xte 'mouseup 1'

mouse up and mouse down work fine.

does anyone here have experience with the xtest extension? this program
(xte) basicly uses these two functions:
  XTestFakeButtonEvent( display, button, True, delay );
  XTestFakeButtonEvent( display, button, False, delay );
for mouse up and mouse down events.

Anyways as soon as I figure out what is going on here, I will report
back.

Thanks,
sa

  It wasn't really a bug report. I was just commenting on
  the two development releases fvwm-2.5.2 and fvwm-2.5.3
  since Dominik is rewriting this area it wouldn't make sense to
  submit a bug report at this time.

   I tried the above. Make install works fine but if you
       make -k install-strip
   then the problem occurs.

   Thanks for the info. The above idea does what I want. i.e
   startx >>/var/log/win_system_log 2>&1
   gives me everything.

   What I had in mind was the thread on the bash syntax. If
   a log was running I would have immediately seen

  /bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `;'

  and now that I have have the log running I notice that I have
  a million errors in my fvwm2rc script.

ok, the reason it doesnt work is because fvwm doesn't execute Key
bindings when the mouse is clicked down. Is there a way to bind a
seperate action to a key press and key release? any Ideas?

thanks,
sa

PS, here is stripped down mouse click program, if anyone is interested.

/* gcc -g -Wall -o click click.c -L /usr/X11R6/lib/ -lX11 -lXtst */
#include <string.h> /* strcmp() */
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/extensions/XTest.h>

int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
    Display *dpy = XOpenDisplay( NULL );
    if (argc == 1) {
        XTestFakeButtonEvent( dpy, 1, True, CurrentTime );
        XTestFakeButtonEvent( dpy, 1, False, CurrentTime );
    } else if  (argc == 2) {
        if ( strcmp(argv[1], "up") )
            XTestFakeButtonEvent( dpy, 1, True, CurrentTime );
        if ( strcmp(argv[1], "down") )
            XTestFakeButtonEvent( dpy, 1, False, CurrentTime );
    }
    XCloseDisplay( dpy );
    return 0;

Dont know if this is the same thing, but is the "make -k install-strip" to remove the dedebug symbol tables? I just change -g -O2 in configure to -O3.

Hmm, I can't reproduce this problem. "/usr/bin/install -c -s ..."
exits with error, but does install a script with +x permissions for me.

Anyway, eventually we'll switch to autoconf-2.53 when creating releases
and "make install-strip" will work well even without -k parameter.

Yes, more or less the same effect may be done by:

  env CFLAGS="-O3" ./configure

or (before "make install"):

  make CFLAGS="-O3"

Mikhael.

There is a bug in the taskbar, if the SelFont is not found the taskbar
exit (the "default" font is not tried!). This will be fixed in the next
stable release. Any way if you use:

	-*-*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
	 ^^

I think that the taskbar will work as you want (no locale change and this
is better than enforcing the charset).
I still do not understand why with
	"-*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
the font loading procedure fails (as xlsfont show me some fonts, but
xlsfont do not use the "i18n" procedure for querying font).
But I do not think that it is fvwm fault. Maybe a "*" count issue.

Use "-*-*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

"man XCreateFontSet" and the xlfd and i18nFramework documents in the X doc
directory (something like /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc). Maybe you will not
find this docs "good".

Some motif windows (in Motif-based gVim or NEdit) can be put inside 
windows by clicking on dashed line on top of the menu. Is there any way to 
do so with menus in Fvwm2 ?

Pin up menus are available in the Fvwm 2.5.x beta series.

A 2.5.x release might be OK for personal use but should not
be widely deployed.

Success -- I just managed it!!!!!!!

I have in the last day or so started to build up a set of togglable java bug
work arounds to put on the menu in AnotherLevelUp. This allows the user to
switch them on/off at will in a persistent way (i.e. next start/restart has
them on/off as you last left them). This reduces the risk of unforseen side
effects, if they were enabled for everyone all the time, and allows users to
experiment and report back what works, how and when.

So far I have implemented 3, and 2 of them certainly seem to help, at least
with blackdown's jdk1.3. I have yet to see any effect from the first one
below. For now I am calling them:

1)	BugOpts ModalityIsEvil

2)	Style AWTdialog ResizeHintOverride

3)	FvwmEvent AWT add_window Deiconify

1) is one of the recommended Java 1.3 `fixes', but I have not yet seen it have
any effect (but have not really given it a good try).

2) I have just managed to successfully use this against a 1x1 modal dialog --
I was able to stretch it out and the real contents appeared!! We're
celebrating here! (BTW, it was the tip of the day dialog for Together 6.)

3) I have successfully used this to get around the non-reappearing dialog and
(app) windows: viz a dialog is created and mapped, user dismisses it, then
later it is reshown, but is remapped iconified. Particularly devastating if
you do not have transient windows appearing in task vars or as icons, etc..
This fix deiconifies all AWTdialog and AWTapp windows when they are mapped,
and it seems to work so far.

I can post the toggle mechanism that AnotherLevelUp uses, if you wish, but
attached are the guts of the work arounds so far, as hopefully self evident
functions.

Best wishes, John Latham

Indeed, you are right -- it works, thanks. I must admit that I have not
fiddled with the fonts in AnotherLevelUp since it was Red Hat's AnotherLevel,
but I have previously noticed the `missing *' and believed it not to be a
problem. Which it isn't, apart from in FVWM 2.4!

I think you are saying it should not cause a problem, as stars are supposed to
match hyphens too. Which is what I believed to be true. The `missing -*' does
not cause a problem in FVWM 2.2.4 nor 2.5.{2,3}, just in 2.4.{6,8}. So,
perhaps FVWM 2.4 is querying fonts in a slightly different way?

> > ....

I will thanks, -- I prefer your fix to mine. This might have other
consequences as Red Hat's AnotherLevel had (and so ALU currently still has):

	define(`BASIC_FONT',`*helvetica')

and then later on things like:

	*FvwmTaskBarFont -BASIC_FONT-medium-r-*-*-FONT_SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

and (now updated to use Style *)

	Style * Font BASIC_FONT-bold-r-*-120-*

etc., so I need to be a bit careful.

Does fvwm2 allow to create a simple framing window around each individual 
icon in a similar way as MWM does ? Hitting the .xpm icons with 
transparent portions is sometimes a tricky task.

I answered your question yesterday in comp.windows.x.apps.

Here is the same answer again:

Nope.

I've heard that .png icons with newer releases of XFree86
allow for you to click on the transparent parts.

I tried yesterday's snapshot this morning.

Good news: I think the cosmetic menu problem has gone, thanks.

Possible bad news -- maybe you are aware of these, but just in case:

1) 	Menus do not stay up like they used to. With

		Mouse 1         R       A       Menu StartMenu Nop

	a single click on the root window used to make the menu stay up. Now,
	it appears and disappears as soon as you let go of the mouse.

 And

		AddToMenu XXX
		+ "blah blah" PopUp SubMenuYYY

	used to make SubMenuYYY stay up if you clicked on the item in XXX.
	(This was with PopupAsRootMenu style.)

2)	I was able to get a maximize button to become `stuck', in the sense
	that every thing I clicked would be toggle maximised -- not even just
	the window that the button belonged to! Clicking on the root window
	would make it look like everything was normal, but as soon as the
	mouse was even moved the original ``sticky button'' would display it's
	ActiveDown mini-icon again. Even killing the program which the sticky
	button window belonged to (via another console) did not resolve the
	problem: the skeleton of it remained on the screen. Only killing X
	could stop it. I was able to invoke this feature twice, but did not
	spend a long time working out exactly what magic sequence was needed.
	I think it involves the window being resized by itself, and/or moved
	by itself prior to clicking the button.

	Would you like me to try to find a more definitive sequence of events,
	or is somebody already onto this bug?

Best wishes, John Latham

If you use the cvs or daily snapshots regularly you should subscribe to
the fvwm-workers list to be up to date with what happens.

You would see that this problem was reported and answered, but not fixed.

You would also see the Dominik's request not to use the today's cvs
because it will crash.

This problem is not known. I don't quite understand what "every thing I
clicked would be toggle maximised" means. Please post all ButtonStyle and
other related lines.

Ooops, sorry. I don't regularly use the snapshots, though I might start doing
at some point, so I might be of more help to you. Dominic asked me to try his
latest menu patch to check if the cosmetic problem was gone, and I figured the
snapshot was the easiest way to get it.

Imagine a new feature (which might even be useful!) called
``PointerIsAMagicWand'' which when set would be given a function and would
then apply that function to every window you clicked on. (I don't know how you
could turn it off!) Anyway, the behaviour I was getting was as though I had
asked for

	PointerIsAMagicWand Maximise 100 97

The button I originally pressed was bound to Maximise 100 97.

I mean, every window I left-clicked on was maximized / de-maximized and
nothing could stop it. This included pager, buttons, task bar, etc.. Also, the
mini-icon decoration for the ActiveDown of the button I had originally pressed
was showing all the time. Left clicking on the root window did nothing except
make the ActiveDown mini-icon be replaced by the normal one. But when the
mouse was moved, even slightly, the ActiveDown mini-icon reappeared.

I attach the ButtonStyles and Mouse bindings which I think were in use at the
time.

I'll try to make it happen again, to search for a minimal sequence of steps
from start up to invoke it. Both times it happened it was with the same
particular PerlTk application. I suspect that one of the steps needed to
invoke the feature is to ask this application to move itself: I have bound the
right mouse button to act as a `grab and move' function for this application
(because it has lots of little windows). Both times I had done that shortly
before pressing the maximise button.

I did not make it clear, sorry: the binding I speak of is a PerlTk binding,
not an FVWM binding. So as far as FVWM is concerned, I presume, the PerlTk
application is asking to be moved, quite a lot of move requests in fact, as I
drag the mouse. (I hope this is Red Herring.)

It's known to me and also caused by the event handling rewrite.
If you are curious, press the maximize/shade/whatever button on a
window, move the pointer out of the button and release it.
Regardless of where you click now the action on the window button
is triggered.

Ok, I wondered whether this may be caused by my InactiveUp/InactiveDown
enhancement.

If a complex functions is bound (like in my case), nothing bad happens,
but, yes, if some command is bound a very bad thing happens. A possible
workaround for this may be to bind ComplexMaximize instead of Maximize:

  AddToFunc ComplexMaximize
  + C Maximize
  #+ H Nop  # this cancels Maximize after some timeout

Mikhael.

Actually today it only failes to compile, crashes are promised later. ;)

This feature is easy to implement in 2.5.1+:

  # repeat command until escape is pressed or root window selected
  DestroyFunc RepeatUntilCanceled
  AddToFunc   RepeatUntilCanceled
  + I Pick $*
  + I Cond (Error) Break
  + I RepeatUntilCanceled $*

  RepeatUntilCanceled Maximize 100 0
  RepeatUntilCanceled UnshadeAndIconify

But Pick is broken for some time now, so _currently_ RepeatUntilCanceled
does nothing.

Mikhael.

I have the following defined in my .fvwm2rc :

Mouse   0       1               A       Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse   0       2               A       Close

# downward triangle - minimize
ButtonStyle 6 4 50x75@1 25x25@1 75x25@1 50x75@0
# large square - maximize
ButtonStyle 4 5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1
# small square - restore
#ButtonStyle 4 5 40x40@1 60x40@1 60x60@0 40x60@0 40x40@1

(swiped straight from the website and sample files, obviously)

What I want to do is use the small square for button 4 if the window is
fullscreen and the large square if it's neither fullscreen nor
iconified. I feel certain this is in the man pages somewhere, but I've
yet to come across it. I have no idea how to approach this.


I'd still like to work on (which may or may not be doable) :

* How to make windows resizable by dragging on the borders, in
  addition to the corner handles (and disabling moving via borders)

* How to make a window truly maximize, rather than stop a few pixels
  short of fullscreen; a nice touch would be to make it _really_
  maximize, with no border showing and no movement possible while
  maximized

* How to either get FvwmTaskBar to swallow FvwmPager, or remove the
  border from FvwmPager (there is also some difficulty in getting focus
  to return to a window after using the pager)

* How to remove the biff applet and clock from FvwmTaskBar

* How to remove the title and geometry info from the WindowList menu but
  still have it pop up centered on the screen

* How to prevent the menu selection from automatically following the
  mouse pointer and vice-versa

* How to get vector buttons to appear in a different color than the
  titlebar

* How to make the handles thicker than the border


...but I'll work on these personal preferences as time allows. :)

Thanks for any advice on my first (real) question. Any input on the
subsequent wish list is appreciated (particularly if something is known
not possible).

I do not think that 2.2.x has i18n support. 2.4.x simply uses the X
i18n interface (with enable-multibyte). What happen is that
XCreateFonSet (an Xlib i18n function) does not load
"-*helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" as XLoadQueryFont
(a "simple" Xlib function) load a font in this case.  In 2.5.x
things are more complex. I do not think that we should do someting
special in 2.4.x.

Yes. But you can click on the shaded part of a png icon. Also you may
build png icons with a quasi-transparent part by using an alpha
channel of 1 (for the transparent part). Then, you will be able to click
on the "transparent part". Any way, I hope that with fvwm 2.6 it will
be possible to define (with colorset) backgrounds for icons.
  Note: in the next devel release alpha blending may work with
any X server.

It's the default on button 2.  If you want the same on another
button you have to tell fvwm about it.  Try this:

  ButtonStyle 4 - MWMDecorMax
  AddButtonStyle 4 5 25x25@1 25x75@1 75x75@0 75x25@0 25x25@1

Find the function in your config files that defines the action on
the window borders.  You should have something like

  Mouse 1 F N <resize command>
  Mouse 1 S N <move command>

Change this to

  Mouse 1 FS N <resize command>

Not at all.  Windows often define their font size and want to be
resized in multiples of it.  The gap is there when the screen size
isn't a multiple of the font size.  Just get used to it.

There are some commands and styles in 2.5.x that make it possible,
but I don't have the time to check it right now.  I think Mikhael
already wrote a setup for this.

The taskbar can't swallow anything.

  Style FvwmTaskBar HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0

The clock can't really be switched off, but can be made to just
print an empty string:

  *FvwmTaskBar: ClockFormat
  *FvwmTaskBar: UpdateInterval 1000000

The second line prevents that the clock is ever updates, saving
some CPU cycles.  To turn off the mail indicator:

  *FvwmTaskBar: MailBox None

> * How to remove the title and geometry info from the WindowList menu but

Find the WindowList command in your config file.  Add the
"NoGeometry" option.  You may be using the default Alt-Tab
binding.  In this case just put this in your config file:

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort NoGeometry

Use a different window manager ;-)  Like it or not, fvwm's menu
handling is tightly coupled with the position of the pointer.
Unless you'd like to spend about a month to change that you can't
do anything about it.

This should be possible with colour sets, but I'm not sure if
they work in title buttons.  Mikhael?

> * How to make the handles thicker than the border

Not with fvwm.

Actually, Len wanted to have different vectors for toggled states.

Here is how to add a new button number 3 that shades a window and looks
differently when shaded or not:

  Style "*" MWMButtons  # button relief follows the state

  Style * Button 3  # Button 1, Button 2, Button 3, Button 4, Button 6

  ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp          Vector 8 40x80@1 40x50@1 20x50@1 50x20@1 80x50@0 60x50@0 60x80@0 40x80@0

Actually this default is in our ConfigFvwmDefaults. I really think this is
a bad default, not very consistent and not very functional. Something like
this would be more consistent and functional:

  Mouse 1 FS A SomeComplexFunctionDoingResize
  Mouse 2 FS A SomeComplexFunctionDoingMove

Try to use "A" instead of "N" whenever is possible, otherwise you end up
with FAQ #0.1.

Maybe it is possible to have an option to keep 2 geometries for a window,
one is the real one and another for decorations, the gap may be filled
with some colorset. But this is complex and probably not very intuitive.

It is possible to do with 2.4.x too, but the if-else is tricky in 2.4.x
and additionally BorderWidth should be hadcoded and handles are forced:

  DestroyFunc MaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
  + I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

  DestroyFunc UnmaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   UnmaximizeFullScreen
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
  + I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5

2.5.x has no such problems (except that individual styles would not hurt):

  DestroyFunc MaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) Style $n Title, Border
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n NoTitle, NoBorder
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize

This is tricky. There is no separate colorset for buttons for now.
In 2.4.1+ vector buttons may use 4 colors, but they are not different than
the ones titlebar uses. These colors are @0, @1, @2, @3 for sh, hi, bg, fg
and they are taken from "Style <pattern> Colorset <c>" if it is defined.

It is possible however to combine several tactics to separate colors of
button vectors from anything else by defining separate BorderColorset (to
let vectors and buttons to use separate colorsets) and define TitleStyle
to use different colors than colorset <c>. This colorset <c> is also used
by default in pager, so depending on the needs this may be changed too.

Another solution is to use images for decorations.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, what about 

*FvwmIconMan: * format %t

? Maybe this an icon/window name problems.

In any case, can you summit a bug report via the bug tracking system.

And it won't work reliably either.  By the way, the reason why
this usually works with windoze is that windoze applications
usually don't specify a font size.

I am afraid that I do not understand the question and the answer.
But, the following behavior is interesting: popup a menu A with an
entry _e which popup a sub-menu B. Popup the menu B, then click on the
entry _e. Then the menu selection does not follow the pointer on the
menu A and its parents neither on the submenus that B can popup (to
activate an entry in these menus just click on it).  The mouse pointer
is followed only in menu B.  To "dynamically" restore the default
behavior just re-click on the entry _e.
Something like "MenuStyle * PopupOffset -6 100" may help. There are
also others "popup" options to MenuStyle that you would like to use.

Maybe we can add a FullyScreen command or option to Maximize in 2.5.x:
The cmd will remove the title and the borders, maximize the window,
and add flat borders so that it seems "fullscreen". Of course there is
an 1 pixel out of visible screen small pbs. Indeed, we can save the
original title/borders parameter as the original geometries are saved
with maximize.

I suggest a fvwm-workers@fvwm.org follow up.

Len refers to fvwm's habit to warp the pointer to the selected
menu item when using the keyboard.

That's a feature.  Clicking on a submenu entry locks the selection
in that submenu until you click somewhere else.  The patch was
inspired by the way menus worked in netscape 4.x.

Yes I discovered this more general behaviour last night when I tried again.
Sorry about the PerlTk application Red Herring. (Actually I'm pleased it
wasn't being caused by that.)

This has also made me realise something, perhaps worth suggesting. It appears
that the window buttons are activated either on press or release, depending on
what they are bound to. It seems they are activated on release if they are
bound to a builtin, and on press if they are bound to a Menu or Function. I
can see why some would argue it is good for them to activate on press if they
are bound to a menu. But I'm not sure this behaviour is the right one for a
function.

Generally I would say that activation on release should be the default for all
buttons, in any GUI, so that if the user has pressed the wrong button, s/he
can move the mouse away before releasing, to avoid the activation. Any
exception to this should be for convenience and only for something which is
safe, e.g. a Menu that has no default operation.

I have just changed my maximize buttons so that they invoke a function to do
an animated maximize, using FvwmAnimate instead of a simple Maximize X Y. Now
they activate on press instead of release!

Perhaps, ultimately, the window buttons could be given a ButtonStyle option so
the user can decide which is most appropriate? Or is there already some way to
control this?

I'll take a closer look at all of your recommendations once I get home
from work this afternoon - Thanks for all the input.

By the way, please understand - By posting such questions, I'm not
criticizing nor complaining... just asking about little details that are
mostly my personal preferences. I'm sure others feel differently and
have different ideas about such things. That's fine with me. I've read
through all the man pages at this point, but I'm sure I'm yet to really
recognize and associate the capabilities of one module when used against
another, etc., etc.

Thanks again.

Just always bind a complex function, then you have a lot of options.
"I" to execute a command on press, "C" or "D" - on release (but there
are some issues), "M" and "H" change the "feel" as well. Try to omit
or add "C", "M", "H" to get different combinations of "feel".

Mikhael.

The minute after I sent the last message it occurred to me I should try out
different function action triggers. I had, of course, just used "I" without
any thought. Doh! Still it's nice to have your bit of general advice aired and
you have stated it so succintly. Thank you. I think "C" looks like the best
default for a complex which is bound to a button.

Oh, weird.  That's exactly what it was.  So i guess Mozilla is
providing a bogus value for its icon title even though it
provides it correctly for the regular title?  Guess i'll go
submit a Mozilla bug...

Hi, all.

I need some help. What I want to do is check if a program is on my
system, and if it is I want to run it in my InitFunction. I'm guessing
this could be done in a Function using PipeRead, but I have no idea how
to do it... :-) Help would be greatly appriciated.

Do what you would do from a script or command line. Something like this:

  Exec which myprogram >/dev/null 2>&1 && myprogram params

Some propretary unices (Solaris) have pretty unusable "which" that always
returns 0 and write errors on stdout. There are also "whereis" (external),
"where", "filetest -X" (tcsh/csh), "hash", "type" (sh).

Regards,
Mikhael.

The problem (the following few lines are also the defintion for what I
call "XCrash" in the rest of this mail)
##################################################################
FVWM crashes when the focus is on an xterm where pine is running
*and* when I type a "Q" or "q" in this situation. Crash means:  FVWM,
i.e. the whole X "really" quits, so I have to start another X.
#################################################################

FVWM is started via .xinitrc, either with this entry:
exec /usr/bin/fvwm-themes-start

or this one:
exec /usr/bin/fvwm
(and IIRC it crashes in both cases: fvwm-themes-start or fvwm)

XCrash happens if
Pine is started from .xinitrc with this entry:
xterm -geometry 92x50+1550+60 -e /usr/bin/pine &

No XCrash
with Pine being started from the FVWM root-menu with this
entry in ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/menus-programs (the following is one
line, just in case you see it as two lines in your MUA)
+ "Pine%menu/mail.xpm%" Exec exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -geometry 92x50 -e /usr/bin/pine

No XCrash
if Pine is started from an xterm with this command:
/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -geometry 92x50 -e /usr/bin/pine &
or with the one I have in .xinitrc

No XCrash
if Pine is started from an xterm with this command:
pine

It *seems* that after FVWM was running about 15 minutes or so this
XCrash problem does not emerge ... which means this Xterm with Pine in
it then is behaving as expected and simply exits without the whole X
going to hell.

This situation seems to be new here: I don't remember having ever seen
it before having installed the new fvwm-2.5.3-1

Best Regards
Wolfgang

Any reason not just to do this:

	Exec myprogram params

If it's there, it runs. If not, it doesn't.

Of course, if you want to do a bit more than just invoke it
then Mikhael's approach is the go. If your "which" always returns 0 you
can try this:

	Exec prog=`which myprogram 2>/dev/null`; [ -f "$$prog" ] && myprogram params

i.e. doesn't trust which's exit status - test the string it returns. The
double $$ is to get the $ through to the shell from FVWM (which also
uses $).

As long as you're willing to distract people with odd host names, the British
Indian Ocean Territory appears to be a safe bet; unlike .cv, .cm, and .vg,
there is still no name service for .io, making it ripe for fictional hosts.
According to my almanac, it contains the Chagos Archipelago, with a surface
area of 23 square miles and no civilian population whatsoever, although both
the UK and the US "maintain a military presence". Presumably any computers it
contains will be in .mil or .uk. - Elizabeth Zwicky <zwicky@greatcircle.com>

Can you reproduce the crash with this two line .xinirc:

  xterm -geometry 92x50+1550+60 -e /usr/bin/pine &
  /usr/bin/fvwm -cmd 'AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmPager'

I can't with fvwm-2.5.3-1 rpm.

Do you get "core" file? It is not very useful, since the binary has
debug information stripped, but at least you may check which program
crashed using gdb (or maybe not crashed, just exited).

Silly question, don't you have by a chance this binding somewhere:

  Key Q R A Quit

... I don't know how to run gdb ... but I could try to view the core
with strings, if this helps ...

The second line already starts fvwm in foreground, don't put any other
lines into ~/.xinitrc except for maybe "sleep 3" in the middle.

The only thing you may do without debuging symbols is to verify that
"gdb -c core" says that "Core was generated by `/usr/bin/fvwm'."
Otherwise, you would run "gdb /usr/bin/fvwm core" and type "where" or "bt".

The same as with the old .xinitrc: XCrash if I type a 'q' on Pine in
an xterm

This is what I see at the comsole (at the end) where I started X:

-------------
/home/nap/.xinitrc: line 7:  1870 Segmentation fault      (core
dumped) /usr/bin/fvwm -cmd 'AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmPager'
-------------------

]$ gdb -c core
[ ... ]
This GDB was configured as "i386-redhat-linux".
Core was generated by `/usr/bin/fvwm -cmd AddToFunc StartFunction I
FvwmPager'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x80a5a7c in ?? ()

                      RESULT WITH MY "DEFAULT" .initrc:

And this is what gdb says about the core file that is generated
with the Pine/XCrash after having started X/FVWM-themes with my
default .xinitrc

$ gdb -c core
[ ... ]
This GDB was configured as "i386-redhat-linux".
Core was generated by `fvwm -f themes-rc'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x80a5a7c in ?? ()

So this happens with no config at all. Fine. Forget fvwm-themes for now.

Please recompile 2.5.3 from sources and install it (say into /usr/local).
Then run the same 2 line .xinitrc, but with /usr/local/bin/fvwm instead.
When you get core, run "gdb /usr/local/bin/fvwm core" and then "where".
Send the stack trace (5-20 lines), preferably to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org.
Thank you very much.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi, All.

The fvwm2.4.8 is now implemented, and is working ok. The basic 95 setup
is used with few modifications needed. I'd had an problem, however, but
it were quickly solved due to help from participants of this list. Now
it's time to move on to the next phase, and this list is no longer
needed. As a fair amount of mails arrive each day, I'll go off the list
to reduce the amount of mails. Guess it will be needed again when
upgrading is nessessary sooner or later, we'll meet again then.

Hi. 

Tried switching my config over to colorsets, and found
that I couldn't get Colorset gradients working.

bg, fg seem fine, but gradient is seemingly not applied.

Orignially, I had the following:

DefaultColors  Black grey77 Black grey51
HilightColor   Black CadetBlue3
HilightColor   Black LightYellow2
TitleStyle ActiveUp Hgradient 128 2 LightYellow2  90 #390909  10 Black --
Raised

Which worked fine.

You did nothing wrong.  For performance reasons, only the four
basic colours (fg, bg, sh, hi) of a colour set are used.  The
titlebar drawing code has its own, more efficient implementation
of gradients.  This is about the only place where you still have
to use non-colour set syntax.

I'm sure other's must have spotted this, but I can't find a bug report so just
in case:

The balloon windows on the pager have no background -- they appear clear,
except for the label and the think black border. This is when using:

	*FvwmPagerBalloonBack   bisque

and other colours. I haven't tried using a pixmap or a colour set (which may
explain why it has gone unnoticed by many...). I think there may have been
some finger trouble in the latest set of edits -- removing some extraneous
lines, as in the patch below seems to make it work again.

Best wishes, John Latham

I've been working on a 4th JAVA work around, for the ``appearing off the
top-left corner'' problem.

DestroyFunc ToggleJAVAFvwmEventAWTConfigureWindowMoveOnScreenOn
AddToFunc ToggleJAVAFvwmEventAWTConfigureWindowMoveOnScreenOn
+ "I" *JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT: Cmd Function
+ "I" *JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT: PassID
+ "I" *JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT: configure_window MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT
+ "I" Module FvwmEvent JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT
+ "I" All Function MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT $w

# This is for 2.4.x so need PipeRead to do the geometry comparison
# Or is there another way?
DestroyFunc MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT
AddToFunc MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT
+ "I" WindowId $0 (AWTapp,Visible) PipeRead "test $[w.x] -lt 0 -o $[w.y] -lt 0 && echo ThisWindow Move 0 0"
+ "I" WindowId $0 (AWTdialog,Visible) PipeRead "test $[w.x] -lt 0 -o $[w.y] -lt 0 && echo ThisWindow Move 0 0"

DestroyFunc ToggleJAVAFvwmEventAWTConfigureWindowMoveOnScreenOff
AddToFunc ToggleJAVAFvwmEventAWTConfigureWindowMoveOnScreenOff
+ "I" KillModule FvwmEvent JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT
+ "I" DestroyModuleConfig JAVAFvwmEventMoveOnScreenAWT*

However, on 2.4.9 (as opposed to 2.5.3) this gives rise to an annoying
problem. Suppose we are running a Java program that is frequently
reconfiguring itself (e.g. it is adding new components and repacking) and we
have enabled this workaround so that it does not creep off the screen. This
means that, due to FVWM grabbing the mouse while complex functions are
executed, any mouse clicks *anywhere* are liable to be received by FVWM. So,
you might click on a FvwmButton somewhere, or on a menu item in the Java
program, and some of your clicks will be got by FVWM and will pop up your root
window menu!

In 2.5.x, these clicks seem to be ignored -- which is safer. But in 2.4.x they
are acted upon -- horribly.

Is this difference deliberate? If so, would it be easy to add the ``throw away
mouse clicks during complex functions'' feature to 2.4.x?

		----------------------------------------------

I have tried a work around, using envrionment variables to disable the root
mouse bindings:

DestroyFunc MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT
AddToFunc MoveOnScreenGivenWindowIfAWT
+ "I" SetEnv FVWMMenuOrNop Nop
+ "I" SetEnv FVWMWindowListOrNop Nop
+ "I" WindowId $0 (AWTapp,Visible) PipeRead "test $[w.x] -lt 0 -o $[w.y] -lt 0 && echo ThisWindow Move 0 0"
+ "I" WindowId $0 (AWTdialog,Visible) PipeRead "test $[w.x] -lt 0 -o $[w.y] -lt 0 && echo ThisWindow Move 0 0"
+ "I" SetEnv FVWMMenuOrNop Menu
+ "I" SetEnv FVWMWindowListOrNop WindowList

with my root menu bindings as:

SetEnv FVWMMenuOrNop Menu
SetEnv FVWMWindowListOrNop WindowList
Mouse 1         R       A       $$[FVWMMenuOrNop] StartMenu Nop
Mouse 2         R       A       $$[FVWMWindowListOrNop] Alphabetic
Mouse 3         R       A       $$[FVWMMenuOrNop] AUTO_WM_CONFIG Nop


I have the *impression* this helps a bit, but it is far from foolproof. Any
suggestions?

Best wishes, John Latham

Yes, you can. If you will be more specific about how you set the border
color for all windows (using Style * BackColor, Style * BorderColorset
or BorderStyle with or without decors), I may answer more specifically.

Searching for "separator" in the FvwmPager gives 2 options for separators
SolidSeparators and NoSeparators, nothing about changing the size.
The size is always 1 pixels as of now.

Some people think 1 is too much to see the mini windows, do you really
want it to be thick?

Search for "color" in the FvwmPager man page (the second mentioning).
Or use Colorset.

Mikhael.

Windows are on top of the border, so the border can disappear.

Please don't ask FVWM questions personally. I would spend much more time
answering the same questions (like this one) if I would answer personally.

The border is usually drawn using a three-dimentional (3d) looking relief.
Hilight and shadow colors are evaluated from the background color (black
in your case), they are gray in 2.4.x. Light shadows look weird on the
dark background, I know. But you can't draw it 3d with black bg otherwise.
You can't set hilight and shadow colors if you use BackColor, but you can
do this with colorsets. Try this:

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmTheme
  *FvwmTheme: Colorset 40 fg yellow, bg black, sh red, hi green

  Style FvwmPager Colorset 40

Then replace "red" and "green" with "black" or any other color.

If you want to see this 3d thing more clearly, set also:

  Style FvwmPager NoHandles, BorderWidth 10

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks for your post, John - please excuse my delay in responding.

Strangely, our 1x1 dialog problem is not Java related.  It's happening on dialogs
created by XmCreateMessageDialog() in C code.  As I mentioned, it's more likely to occur
when the CPU is under load and/or the X server has a backlog of events to work through
due to being swapped out.  Our workaround is to add a map callback for the dialog; when
it fires, we see if the dialog was mapped "too small" and if so, allow the dialog shell
to become resizeable (we are also looking at a programmatic forced resize to a hardwired
height and width).

My suspicion is that both your problem and ours have the same root cause, but at this
point I can't be sure whether it's an fvwm problem or an X server problem.  (We run
2.4.7 on Solaris 8 now; previously we ran fvwm95 on Solaris 7.)

I'd be curious to know if anyone else has seen the 1x1 problem outside of Java.

Hi,


first a short disclaimer -- I have no idea if this is the correct
mailing list, but there seems to be no other way of contacting the
fvwm maintainers. If this mail is inapropriate, I'm sorry.

Anyway, I have an addendum to FAQ 4.3 "I'm seeing odd things when
trying to preprocess files with the FvwmM4/Cpp module...".

I was seeing strange things too. On our setup, the main .fvwm2rc file
reads a number of different subfiles, some of which were parsed with
FvwmM4. This periodically led to a race condition where FvwmM4 was not
finished processing before the M4 output was needed elsewhere in the
configuration (in our case, the problem was with FvwmButtons being
started before the apps to swallow had been started). The fix detailed
in FAQ 4.3 did not help (because we were starting other modules), but
the solution was surprisingly simple:

I replaced all "FvmM4 <file>" commands with "PipeRead 'm4 <file>'" and
everything seems to work now.

Well, this may be useful, but it is not the same, none of the X and FVWM
related constants are expanded, usual search paths are not used and so on.

The real solution to your synchronization problem is to invoke FvwmM4
with the -lock switch.

If you insist not to use any 2.4.x features, we can't help. The support on
this list and the FAQ (not counting some non-updated parts) is for 2.4.x.

Yes, I forgot to mention that for -lock to work you should run:

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 -lock <file>

Do you have anyone particular in mind with "someone"?  I didn't
really this thread, but I suspect that unless "someone" is you,
nothing will happen.

I think a man page update is called for.
I'll see what I can come up with.

When I press Alt-Tab a fvwm window list appears
even though I have the following line in my .fvwm2rc file:

Key	Tab	A	M	-

How can I disable this key setting (FVWM version 2.4.3)?

Thanks

Klaus

In principle, that's the correct command.  If it doesn't work, a
different binding must be somewhere in the config files.  Look for
bindings with the tab key in your config file and the
ConfigFvwmDefaults that comes with the distribution.  You have to
negate all bindings by issuing the same command to "-" as the
action.

Make sure you have this line in the correct ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc file.
In case you have two .fvwm2rc files.

That should work.

I don't see anything in the NEWS file that implies there was
a problem with unbinding keys in 2.4.3, but perhaps you
should try a more current stable release.

Also look for error messages coming out of fvwm.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure this is really on topic on the FVWM list for
which I apologise, but it's definitely a related query.

I am looking for a way to make it easier to tell the many xterms I
always end up running apart in the window lists. What I am currently
thinking of doing is changing the title of each xterm to something like
"xterm (<username>) - <last issued command>"

Using the environment variable PROMPT_COMMAND I can give bash a command
to execute before it draws each prompt, which would seem to be the right
time to do the change. What I don't know is how to change the xterm
title from within bash - is it possible, and if so, how?

Many thanks,

Andy

PS. If anyone else has any other ideas on how to solve the problem of
making the xterms easier to tell apart I'd be interested to hear them.

I commented out the line that defines A-tab in ConfigFvwmDefaults and now
it works. Looks as if that line above doesn't work properly.
Since I'm the only fvwm user in my department (sad I know), I can
modify the defaults without affecting others.

The support in this mailing list is great and the response time
is unbelievable. Many thanks.

There are some special escape sequences that chenge the window
title.  Use this command:

  printf "\e]2;"blabla"\a"

And replace "blabla" with the desired text.  In zsh, the syntax is

  print -Pn "\e]2;blabla\a"

In the 2.5.x branch (unstable development versions at the moment),
Windows with the same title can be numbered with

  Style * IndexedWindowName

So instead of

  xterm
  xterm
  ...

you get

  xterm
  xterm (2)
  xterm (3)
  ...

There is an escape sequence that changes the title.
This creates the "shdr" function to change the title:

  function shdr	{		# changes screen title
    # This would make Rumba hang, so only do for some TERMs:
    if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" -o "$TERM" = "rxvt" ] ; then
      print -n '\033]2;'$*'\07'
    fi
  }

I find that doing most of my work in XEmacs removes the need for
a host of xterms.

> What I don't know is how to change the xterm title from within bash
> - is it possible, and if so, how?

    Here's what I do:

    In a shell script that is sourced at startup:

---
# set prompt for xterm vs. non-xterm
setprompt()
{
      local TITLEBAR=""
      local prompt="[\w]"

      case $TERM in
        xterm*|screen)
            TITLEBAR="\[\033[^[]0;\h: \w\007\]"
            ;;
      esac

      prompt="${TITLEBAR}[\$(basename \$(dirname \w))/\$(basename \w)]"
      PS1="$prompt"
}
---

    At some later point in time, call the setprompt function. The
function will (among other things) set the titlebar to a string of the
form, "hostname: /full/path/of/current/dir" e.g. "koo: /home/koo". You
don't need to use the PROMPT_COMMAND variable ;).

    If all you want is the escape code, its there in the "TITLEBAR"
variable above. I got that from "man console_codes" (mandrake 8.2).

    HTH.

The way I do it is that I open each xterm for a purpose. If it is a
local terminal then I call it xterm@localhost and the rest I call it
with the names of the computers I log into. One xterm is for the e-mail.
I have mutt rename it with this lines in .muttrc:

 set xterm_set_titles=3Dyes
 set xterm_title=3D"Mail"

So I have no need to make changes in the xterm name. If you have few
xterms oppened for the same computer it can be tricky, I never had more
than 2-3, except for the localhost. In that case I have special defined
few xterms (different colors and names) and it never happend to have
more than those oppened.

You can try the function which change the title for xterm, but what if
the last command on all xterm is 'ls -ltr'?

Hello

after www.themes.org has been moved to freshmeat.net, number Fvwm themes 
has drastically decreased (namely to 5). This makes an impression, that 
fvwm community is inactive, which is not true. So, I encourage everybody 
tto participate in adding themes to freshmeat.net, or pushing people from 
freshmeat to include old fvwm.themes.org into their collection.

Hi,
  I was unable to find xlock in /usr/bin/X11 or elsewhere.

 Does fvwm allow screen locks? If so, can anyone tell me where i
can find it?

thanks,
ashok.

You may install either xlockmore package (enhanced xlock)
or xscreensaver package.

Then bind xlock a menu item.
Or run "xscreensaver -no-splash &" in ~/.xinitrc or from InitFunction
and it may lock automatically.

Mikhael.

...that's maybe not already answered in obvious fashion somewhere. :)

I have an FvwmForm dialog "RunCommand", which just offers a field to
specify and run a command. It works fine, but I'd like to limit it to
one instance only. How can I make it basically "application modal"? Is
there a way to check to see if it's already up and if so, abort?

I've tried *RunCommandGrabServer, which does indeed stop everything
else, but it allows more RunCommands (I have it assigned to Alt+F2).
Also, for example, if I press Alt+Tab while it's up, nothing happens.
However when I either run or cancel it, the windowlist shows up. This
may be unavoidable and is no biggie.

Is there a way to maybe set a flag variable and check for its existance
prior to running? If so, maybe a generic "only once" function could be
written. In a shell script, C, etc., I could do this, but I'm not sure
how with fvwm.

I'm running 2.4.6, if it makes any difference.

Thanks.

Is it possible to setup a keybinding so that it works everywhere
except for one particular window?

I have this in my .fvwmrc2 file:

Key F1     WFSIT  N  RaiseLower
Key F2     WFSIT  N  Iconify

I would like the F1 and F2 keys to work for all windows except
for one particlar window. How do I do that?

I also use VNC. This means that I have a normal desktop plus there is
a window on the desktop that is itself a full desktop. When I hit
F1 or F2 I want that key to go to the VNC desktop...

I'm running  2.2.4. Thanks for any help. I am not on the fvwm mailing
list.

-Ram

It is possible to ignore the binding for one (or more) specific widnow.
In recent versions (2.4.6+) this should be used:

  Key F1     WFSIT  N  ThisWindow (!MySpecialWindow) RaiseLower

In previous versions this may work (probably in 2.2.x, but I didn't test):

  Key F1     WFSIT  N  WindowId $w (!MySpecialWindow) RaiseLower

($$w should also work here, since one dollar would be eaten by Key.)

I don't think this is easily possible. Once you defined a key inside "W",
it is captured in all windows. You may try to send synthetic key events,
but I don't think it will work.

The most relable solution I see is to bind Shift-F1 for raising windows.
Or, instead, use F1 as usual, but press Shift-F1 to pass it to VNC.
Or even press Num-Lock, then F1 should be passed to your window as well.

The other approach you might use, which is certainly uglier, is what
I use: I have two styles. My normal one,"zen", has no titlebars or
handles etc.  Consequently, I have lots of keybindings to the "W"
context to manipulate windows.

When I have a VNC desktop up I have exactly your problem. So I also have
a style "nested" which has titlebars etc, purely to provide handles for
dragging things around without requiring key bindings. Thus:

	[...]
	Style "zen"	UseStyle "general", NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0
	Style "nested"	UseStyle "general", Title, BorderWidth 2, HandleWidth 2, BackingStore, SaveUnder
	Style "*"	UseStyle zen
	[...]
	DestroyFunc SetModeZen
	AddToFunc SetModeZen	I	DestroyStyle "*"
	+			I	Style "*" UseStyle "zen"
	+			I	Recapture
	DestroyFunc SetModeTitled
	AddToFunc SetModeTitled I	DestroyStyle "*"
	+			I	Style "*" UseStyle "nested"
	+			I	Recapture
	[...]
	Mouse 					1 R N		Menu Menu1
	DestroyMenu Menu1
	AddToMenu Menu1		"Menu1"		Title
	[...]
	+			"Zen Mode"	SetModeZen
	+			"Titled Mode"	SetModeTitled

Ugly, but it at least makes the VNC desktop manipulable.

hello,

I am trying to make my icons sticky. So, I made a function
that does Iconfiy and then Stick.

The problem, however, is that now when the window is raised,
it is "stuck".

Is it possible to make some Raise-And-Unstick-If-Stuck
function?

I am using fvwm 2.4.6.

thanks,

denis

Hate to reply to my own posts, but I realized the question

I think I am looking for DeIconfify-And-Unstick-If-Iconfified
function, not "raise".

Also, I am not worried about a simple "DeIconify" function,
since that probably will be taken care of by my
Iconfify-And-Stick.

However, my windowlist function looks like this:

   DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
   AddToFunc WindowListFunc
   + "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
   + "I" WindowId $0 Focus
   + "I" WindowId $0 Raise
   + "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

So, this de-iconifies Iconified windows, but if they will be
"stuck" I'd like to unstick them as well. "Stick" does not
work by itself, since it will stick all windows :(

thanks,

denis

Look for StickyIcons in the man page.

Hello,

first of all, sorry, I dont know how to properly phrase the
question, so I'll try the example.

I am using gAIM as my instant messenger. When I have some
conversation window open and receive a message, the window
is raised. My focus follows mouse, so the window does not
seem to get the focus.

The question, then, is whether it is possible to be on a
different desktop, and have this Gaim window start blinking,
change color, etc when some raise event is received?

please let me know if the question was not clear.

thanks,

denis

I will answer the following question that may be not what you want, but
at least it is stated clearly. :)

"I have 4 desktops (each one 2x2 pages). My main Gaim window is on desktop
number 0. I am on desktop number 2. A window pops up on desktop 0 (or a
window is raised by Gaim, or deiconified by Gaim). I want to have a more
visual notification when this happens than using a pager."

The answer is: if FVWM does something with this window and you want to add
more operations, setup FvwmEvent to do Beep or Iconify/DeIconify several
times or Maximize/UnMaximize on the appropriate event.

  AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-MyBlink

  *FvwmEvent-MyBlink: PassId
  *FvwmEvent-MyBlink: Cmd
  *FvwmEvent-MyBlink: add_window BlinkSomeWindows
  *FvwmEvent-MyBlink: raise_window BlinkSomeWindows

  AddToFunc BlinkSomeWindows
  + I WindowId $0 (MyGaimWindowIWantToBlink) Beep
  + I WindowId $0 (MyGaimWindowIWantToBlink) WarpToWindow 50 50
  #+ I WindowId $0 (MyGaimWindowIWantToBlink) WindowShade on
  #+ I WindowId $0 (MyGaimWindowIWantToBlink) WindowShade off

You probably only need one "add_window" or "raise_window".
Be careful, you may easily auto-do something that is very annoying.

Regards,
Mikhael.

On the first of June, 2003, we will be celebrating fvwm's tenth
birthday.  It may seem an eternity now, but the preparations will
probably take much longer than I believe right now.  As fvwm is
mostly about users, I'd like to invite everybody to help planning
the Grand-Fvwm-Birthday-Event (tm).  I have collected a few vague
ideas (o = maybe, * = must):

  * Publish some words about fvwm history.
  * Promote the event (magazines, announcement lists, newsgroups).
  * Finish the 2.6 release before that day.
  * Vamp up the web page for the event.
  o Find Robert Nation and get at least a statement from him.
  o Revive the fvwm logo contest a few months before the birthday
    and proclaim the winning logo on the birthday.
  o Create an IRC channel on that day.
  o Make a web page with photographs of the developers.

Don't hesitate to post your suggestions, comments, offers for help
or whatever you can think of.

Although I posted this message on both, the fvwm and the
fvwm-workers list, I would like to keep this discussion on the
fvwm-workers mailing list to keep the noise on fvwm low.  Please
reply to fvwm-workers.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

I tried to send this to the bug report web page, but it refuses the
connection...

If the FvwmWinList module is invoked as a transient (e.g., bound to
a mouse button) the configuration for mouse button action in the
resulting window doesn't work.  All mouse buttons will invoke the
action assigned to button 1.

The problem is with code at lines 815 through 817 in FvwmWinList.c
(version 2.4.10).

The code looks like this,

      SendFvwmPipe(Fvwm_fd,
         ClickAction[(Transient) ? 0:Event.xbutton.button-1],
	 ItemID(&windows,num));

and instead probably should be,

      SendFvwmPipe(Fvwm_fd,
         ClickAction[Event.xbutton.button-1],
	 ItemID(&windows,num));

HI

In the 'screen shots' section of the fvwm site, I have a 
theme which mimics the look of cde. Now, I put the theme
on www.freshmeat.net, from which a tar.gz can be downloaded
that contains all necessary files. I'd like to add a link to that site
in the screen shot comment. The link is 

http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/cdemu

Best regards

jos

I should say this is a very good work for the CDE emulation.

Just a note, it should probably work in 2.5.3 although I didn't test it,
but not with 2.5.4 (from cvs). The perllib event handler API was improved.
You should change 2 lines in code. See http://fvwm.org/generated/perllib/

Expect some more small changes in API until it is stabilized in 2.6.0.

Regards,
Mikhael.

shouldn't that be an "maybe" item as that release will server nobody
if it would be only in name sake?  i would much prefer a stable
version (any of 2.[45].x) than the _necessary_ 2.6 ...

...of course, if the release just happen to be on the birthday, that
would be another thing.

Other than what we do anyway?  No.  What exactly would a "special
feature" be?  All menus being decorated with a birthday cake in
the backgroung on that day?

What I have in mind is a release that we can point at that isn't
two years old.  I am planning to spend less time before the 2.6
release anyway.  I will definitely not push it if it isn't
stabilizing fast enough.

Does spending less time  mean fvwm development if canceled ? And - I

No, I was comparing the time between 2.2 and 2.4  (2.5 years) with
the time between 2.4 and 2.6 (hopefully < 2 years).

It means that 2.4 development got out of hand and that I want to
retain better control over release dates.  2.3.x was in feature
freeze for about a year.  That must not happen again.

Yes.

Probably not an fvwm question, but. Is it possible to hide the cursor 
when i start typing? Half the time the cursor is obscuring something, 
and I like the Mac behaviour that it disappears from view while I'm 
typing.

Have a look at the "unclutter" utility for X11.  Most Linux/*BSD distros
include it.  It hides the cursor whenever the mouse stays motionless for
some predefined duration.

Have a look at unclutter. I don't remember where I found it (google),
it appears not to be maintained anymore; but I've used version 0.80
for several years without any pain. Does exactly what you want.

Hello,

I am trying to add a command to the window to stay on top.
I know of a Style option, but I dont think its appropriate
here?

I'd like to do something like :

   DestroyMenu Window-Ops
   AddToMenu Window-Ops 
   + " Window Ops (ALT-F1)"               Title
   + " [Un] StaysOnTop"                   <WHAT GOES HERE?>

I looked through the built-in fvwm function list, and could
not find a function to call :(

thanks,

denis

It is called Layer.

  + "StaysPut"      Layer 0 4

Or if you really don't want one additional StaysPut menu item, in 2.4.6+:

  + "StaysOnTop"    SwapWithLayer 6
  + "StaysOnBottom" SwapWithLayer 2

  AddToFunc SwapWithLayer
  + I ThisWindow (Layer $0) Layer 0 10
  + I ThisWindow (Layer  4) Layer 0 $0
  + I ThisWindow (Layer 10) Layer 0 4

Actually you may do all this with only one menu item by 3-value looping
(Normal -> OnTop -> OnBottom -> Normal). Left as an exercise.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I'm sorry, I don't think I understand the question.

Are you referring to the screens you see in FvwmPager?

If so, find the line that looks like this:

DeskTopSize 3x3

and change it to something like

DeskTopSize 4x4

I am new and really happy user of fvwm. I found some tips for 
improvements:

1,FvwmPager would benefit from having separate colorsets for desk labels.

2,FvwmIconBox has troubles when combinig 

*PanelIconBox: Resolution Desk
*PanelIconBox: Placement Left Bottom

3, I already asked about if it is possible to bind action to transparent 
parts of icons, but now I submit it as a recomended feature. Sometimes 
transparent parts of icons are really nasty thing. Mwm solved this by 
creating those miniature "windows" around each icon. Fvwm is said to be 
mwm-mimickable, so this useful feature would be really nice.

HI

I think work on this is (still?) in progress. To get this feature the
fvwm developers can exploit some functionality of tearoff menus, ie to 
put a window border around an icon, which are still under development.
But maybe some time in the (near) future. (Would also be nice for my 
cde emulation ;-)

Some icons actually gets a relief around (I'm using 2.5.4 and IconSize
style), these are all monchrome icons. They also get the window border
colours (change to active colour when active also). I don't know if this
is intedend.

If the icons are not transparent, they get a border.

Hi!
I've just installed fvwm2 on my RedHat 7.3 box. It seems to be an extremely customizable wm but I can't find information about changing my keyboard settings for a french-canadian keyboard. Where do I set the keyboard mapping?

Thank you,

Alexandre A. de Verteuil

I can't see the conection between fvwm and keyboard.
You can use xkeycaps to setup a customized keyboard map
(and to generate am .xmodmap file) or you can use xkb
functions (like setxkbmap fr to set a french keyboard).

Yes, most likely someone on this list can help you.

Please post the error message.

Probably, if you send us this error message.

This will be fixed if you help. I don't think many have hp-ux.

In my opinion, you will get better answers on the fvwm
mailing list.

I just tried to configure on my HPUX 11.11 system with fvwm-2.4.11
and didn't have any problems.  I used HP's compiler, not gcc.

You might want to look in the config.log too.
You should see the small sample program used in the configure
test and the error that occurred trying to compile or run it.

Oops, a little too much snippage.

Just above this area in the config.log, you will see
configure trying to compile different versions of this
routine.

Each time it gets a failure, you will see the error it got,
and then it tries another variation.
It fails because it can't find any variation that works.

On my HPUX 11.11 system, using "cc" (not gcc), this is
the version that works:

#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int
main ()
{
extern select (int,
 fd_set *,	fd_set *, fd_set *,
 struct timeval *);
  ;
  return 0;
}

Does this compile without errors for you?  If not what
errors do you get?

Please continue to copy the fvwm list, there are other people
on the list, and if I go astray, one of them is sure to help.

I can reproduce this if I pass the arg "-Ac" or "-Aa" to the
compiler.  Without the arg or with "-Ae" it compiles fine.

You apparently have a different version of the compiler installed
or somehow you are passing different args.

First check and make sure you don't have the environment variable
CCOPTS preset:

echo $CCOPTS

If it is set, unset it and try again.
If its not set, try this:

CCOPTS=-Xe;export CCOPTS

then try to compile the test program.

If that works, try configure.
If that doesn't work, try to find out more about your compiler:

man cc

CCOPTS was not set, sure that you mean the option -Xe? Anyway, i'm
going to try -Ae and -Xe

# CCOPTS=3D-Xe;export CCOPTS
# echo $CCOPTS
-Xe

# cc -o /tmp/test /tmp/test.c

Ok, I see it now.
I did some Google searches.

The bundled compiler apparently only supports K&R C.
I don't think you are going to be able to build Fvwm
with it.

I wasn't able to find any documentation on the compiler
but I do see lots of other programs won't compile with it.

Perhaps you have another compiler installed somewhere else.
On my machine, I have C compilers installed thusly:

 /opt/ansic/bin/cc
 /bin/cc -> /opt/ansic/bin/cc
 /usr/softbench/bin/cc
 /usr/bin/cc -> /opt/ansic/bin/cc
 /usr/ccs/bin/cc -> ./cc_bundled

If you don't have any other HP compiler,  I recommend you
install gcc.

That what i have done already... but with the same results. I think i'm
going to compile fvwm with ANSI-C at work, maybe this will work.
If this will work it's a acceptable workaround but the problem still
exist :[

Another idea?

Kindly regards
Frank

I can't add anything to what Dan said. Your compiler is not a correct
compiler. Please install any ANSI-C conforming compiler. Better yet gcc.
If you have problems with these ones, please post the error messages.

Hi !

I'm running fvwm 2.5.4 (from cvs) compiled on Sep 24 2002 at 13:00:52.

If I invoke the 'Move' from a menu or from FvwmConsole, the usual outline 
of the window to be moved that appears after clicking on the window is 
shifted wrt the position of the window, usually on the left and below.

The same 'Move' is fine if started from a menu bounded to one of the 
window buttons, or from clicking on the title bar.

I think that the logic is somehow broken in the sense that the current 
position of the cursor when the Move command is invoked gives this strange 
behaviour.

Please let me know if I can help sending extracts of my .fvwm2 (non 
changes since last time I posted it here).

Please Cc for a faster feedback.

Thanks a lot !

regards,
Giuseppe.

Gee, Debian could put it just about anywhere.

On my Mandrake box, I typed:

locate system.fvwm2rc

and found this:

/usr/share/doc/menu-2.1.5/examples/system.fvwm2rc

If you are trying to create a starting config file, the
best technique is to start up fvwm without any config file
at all, then press any mouse button on the root window
(or press F1), and use one of the setup procedures.

In addition to finding the sample.fvwm2rc file which comes with
the distribution, I would _highly_ recommend going to google at,

    http://groups.google.com/advanced_search

and doing a search on the single word "fvwm2rc".  You'll turn up
nearly 8000 hits, so it might also be good to limit the search
to the last 3 months and English, plus set it to show 100
responses instead of just 10 (because you will still get 2500
hits).

Most of what you'll find is heavily based on the sample fvwm2rc
files that come with the distribution.  But it will give you an
idea just how differently many people manage to find ways to run
fvwm.

I've been using fvwm since version 1 came out, but I've only
been subscribed to this mailing list for a couple weeks.
However, I'll bet that if you start talking about specific
things you want to try, or in any way give an idea what you'd
like your desktop to look like and be able to do, you'll
probably find several people just overjoyed to tell about how
they configured fvwm to _thier_ idea of perfection!

Hi,

Would it be possible to trigger an event when, for example, one presses the
CTRL key for a certain time? I imagine something like this:

- press CTRL for a second
- pop up dialog
- press additional key to trigger another event (becomes key combination
  CTRL+<key>)

I suppose it's possible and - to me ;) - it would be rather nice..

Regards,

  Bob

Hi,

I read the manual and there's too much to get a simple
start, even after looking at various google results.

Can you build the .fvwm2rc interactively by trying
configuration commands in an xterm? I hate the default
settings that you can select to generate from the default
menu.

I noticed there's a console thing that i think accepts
builtin commands. Would that be useful?

Try the "Direction" command.

To enter interactive commands, you can use
FvwmConsole, FvwmTalk, and FvwmCommand.
Each of these accepts any command you can put in your .fvwm2rc.

For what you describe, FvwmConsole would be best.

It might be possible, but not without source code changes.

Cool. I missed that one reading the man pages.

Btw, I think it would also make sense to base the choice of the 
window not on the midpoint but on the edge, for instance left edge if 
you specify Direction East. And maybe look at the lowerleft corner if 
Direction NorthEast, &c.

Wrong :-)  Don't underestimate fvwm's scripting features, Dan.

You can get a rough approximation of that behaviour with 2.5.x:

  Key Control_L A A Schedule 1000 1234 Menu RootMenu
  Key F1        A C SomeOtherActionAndDeschedule
  AddToFunc SomeOtherActionAndDeschedule
  + I Deschedule 1234
  # insert custom actions below here
  + I WindowShade
  ...

This solution has a few drawbacks:

 1) The timing may not be accurate and vary.
 2) It effectively disables the left control key in all
    applications.  You should better use a modifier key that no
    application knows about.
 3) You have to issue the "Deschedule ..." line for every action
    that may be triggered with the key.
 4) When the key is released before the timeout, the menu still
    pops up after a second.

There is little you can do about the first two.  The latter two
can be solved once we have a "KeyRelease" command that allows
triggering actions when a key is released.  With that, we could
add

  KeyRelease Control_L A A Deschedule 1234

(Wow, sometimes even I am surprised what you can do with fvwm!)

The potential tuning possibilities are endless.  I could easily
think of a dozen different scoring algorithms or even a custom
shell script that calculates the score and is called for each
window.

The current algorithm was written to minimize surprises, but the
right one for you looks probably differently.

To sum it up, I'm certainly willing to add tuning options to the
Direction command, but my time to do it myself is limited at the
moment.

If you guys don't stop adding features, I'm going to have to
stop trying to answer questions. :)

I hesitated to answer this one.  It seems like every time I think
Fvwm can't do something I'm proven wrong.

Hi all!
I got interested in your theme.
But when i try to "startx" there are files in INC@ that can't be found.
Did I do something wrong?
I did all those file moves you said in all folders.

Thank you

I don't think Jos will be able to help you without seeing the whole error
message. Anyway, you need a certain fvwm version (2.5.3) and Gtk-Perl
installed, for example see

  http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=gtk-perl

Could someone look at the source for obvious bugs in this? I set up 
Shift-{Left,Right} to do Direction {West,East} Focus, and if there is 
a window that is (totally, or almost so) contained within the outline 
of another (but not with coincident centres) it gets focus only one 
of the two directions. For instance, if it's offset to the right, it 
only gets focus if I'm arrowing left.

This is fairly reproducible.

Hi, everybody.

I'm working on giving FVWM the "correct" environment (variables etc) so
that application I run from FVWM functions correctly. I know I can just
define them in my ~/.xinitrc but that's kind of ugly, so I'm just
curious how other people have solved this?

Every application has its own "vision" regarding how to get the
configuration (from variables, files, options, database and so on).

For applications that require setting variables (for example 'less' uses
$LESS, $LESSEDIT, $LESSOPEN, $LESSCHARSET) you may do this in the login
shell startup files (the details depend on the shell). An application
launched by fvwm inherits all environment variables that fvwm itself gets.

If an application requeres some specific preparations, create a wrapper
script for this application and run the wrapper instead.

For example ~/bin/wine (or /usr/local/bin/wine) may look like this:

#!/bin/sh
PATH=/opt/wine/bin:$PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/wine/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
WINEPREFIX=/tmp/wine

PROG=`basename $0`
/opt/wine/bin/$PROG --managed "$@"

Mikhael.

Sure, that's exactly how it's described in the man page.  If the
center of the new window is left of the center of the old window,
only "W" works.  In 2.5.4, there is a new direction "C"enter that
just works on the closest window in any direction.

Hi

to make the theme work I needed some features of 
fvwm 2.5.3. However, in the meantime, the development 
has of course continued, and I haven't yet adapted 
the script to some of the changes. So you need to use
a somewhat older snapshot to make the script work:

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-20020716.tar.gz

Also you need gtkperl and some other stuff, but that is
documented in the README files. Please let me know if you
need to know anything more

I got interested in your theme.
But when i try to "startx" there are files in INC@ that can't be found.
Did I do something wrong?
I did all those file moves you said in all folders.

Thank you
Mattias Andersson, Falun Sweden.

I'm running mozilla remotely and i find that not long after it's been
running, it takes longer and longer for mozilla to give control back to
fvwm.  Is there anyting i can set to prevent mozilla from blocking fvwm from
doing its thing?

I'm running 2.5.3 on Solaris 2.5.1 (mozilla 1.1 on 5.8).
Using clicktofocus

Thanx

I don't see it.

I tried Mozilla 1.1 from Linux to Linux over a cable modem for
about 10 minutes.

While Mozilla has focus, the blinking cursor causes constant
network traffic.

During page changes the various animations cause heavy X traffic.
During all this, Fvwm still changes frame colors on focus change
or pops up menus instantly.

I don't think Mozilla should be doing anything that would interfere
with Fvwm.

I'm not sure what you mean about giving control back to Fvwm.

It gets slower over hours.

W/ mozilla last having focus, operating on a window (Iconify, Back, etc),
opening a menu or giving focus to another window.  It starts taking longer
and longer from mouse/key click till the operation happens....and in the
meantime, everything is frozen (tho the mouse moves and the pending clicks
are buffered and eventually happen).

Hmm, I don't think I want to abuse my connection to test it.

Maybe the X server is getting more traffic than it can handle.
Does the cursor blinking in Mozilla slow down?
The cursor only blinks when its in an input field.
Are there animations visible?

Is it just Fvwm that slows down or is Mozilla slow too?

It's initially ok and then gets worse over time.

< Is it just Fvwm that slows down or is Mozilla slow too?

Using Mozilla, everything's ok.  It gets slower and slower over time going
from using Mozilla to doing something outside Mozilla (windowing/menu/focus)
operations (Going *to* Mozilla is never a problem).  One time when it really
hung up....remote logging in, X was busy.

Theres no animations in the web pages.


Is Mozilla clingy, having abandonment issues?

Can someone point me in the right direction?

I have the following simple FvwmForm definition :

*RunCommandTitle "Run a command"
*RunCommandFore black
*RunCommandBack grey70
*RunCommandFont *helvetica*b*r*n*14*
*RunCommandFore navy
*RunCommandLine center
*RunCommandFont *helvetica*b*r*n*12*
*RunCommandButtonFont *helvetica*b*r*n*12*
*RunCommandInputFont -sun-screen-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
# items
*RunCommandText "Command line"
*RunCommandInput cmd 40 ""
*RunCommandLine right
*RunCommandItemFore darkred
*RunCommandButton quit " OK " ^M
*RunCommandCommand exec exec $(cmd)
#*RunCommandCommand RunCmd $(cmd)
*RunCommandItemFore black
*RunCommandButton quit " Cancel " ^[
*RunCommandCommand nop

This works fine, but I'd like to add a "last command" button to the
form. Adding the additional button is easy, but I'm stumped on how to :

1. Save $(cmd) between invocation
2. Load cmd with $(lastcmd) (or whatever) with a button press

Ideally, I'd like to be able to visually see the last command line
reloaded into the cmd text field, then just click OK to run it. An
alternate solution (though less ideal to me) would be to simply run the
last $(cmd) when the last button was clicked.

I can substitute the direct exec on the run button with the following
rather obvious function (commented above), but I'd like to also have it
save the command line :

AddToFunc RunCmd
+   "C" exec exec $0

If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

For an example of a form that saves its data between invocations,
look at the FvwmForm-Rlogin form in the man page.  (Also installed
automatically.)

The key is the "UseData" part.

Hi,

Is there any fvwm2 manual that is formatted for
printing with an apropriate fit to A4 pages like
a pdf? I can only print from a windows box at the
moment.

How can I configure the pager window so that it behaves as before?
(I just upgraded to FVWM version 2.4.6 (by upgrading to Debian 3.0 (woody)).)


Specifically, it used to work like this:

- if I raised it, it went into stay-on-top mode;

- if I lowered it, it lowered and partipated normally in the z order 
  until I raised it again.  (That is if I lowered other windows, it
  might end up on top of them, but I could re-raise those windows 
  and it would remain behind them until I raised it directly and it 
  reverted to stay-on-top mode.

Thanks.


Daniel

by fvwm95 do you mean fvwm?  if so you would add somthing like the
following to your fvwm2rc (`man fvwm2` for details):

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc   InitFunction
+ I Exec    opera

If you are really using fvwm95, you're on the wrong list :-)

I'm having the same problem, running mozilla-1.0 remote and fvwm-2.4.3
on Solaris 2.8.

I don't have a postscript printer, haven't used any
postscript utilities, and thought there'd be an
easier way. I can't print the man page as ascii,
because all the highlighted text has ^H characters.
Is there a way to get rid of them?

I think you could probably find manpages elsewhere. Just
type "man ..." on google, where '...' is the page you're
looking for. Dont know how recent they are though.

In any case, I ran man2html on the set of pages I have,
which probably is something like 2.4.7 (latest stable is
2.4.11) and the result is here:

http://lecs.cs.ucla.edu/~denisp/man.fvwm/html/

original pages themselves are here

http://lecs.cs.ucla.edu/~denisp/man.fvwm/

dont know how long they'll stay up there, so grab 'em if you
want.

Hi...

I've just installed fvwm 2.4.11 on Solaris 9.  It compiled and installed
without any problems.

The problem I am having is that during login, it seems to have a problem
processing the .fvwm2rc file.  It gets so far and then my machine "beeps"
and I'm left with only the config it's processed up until that point
(normally just my mouse menus).  I then do a restart of fvwm and it all
comes up, including my FvwmButtons.  I've tried it with the sample .fvwm2rc
files and I still get the same thing, so it's not just my .fvwm2rc file.

Does anyone know why fvwm2 "hangs" half way through startup and then works
perfectly after a restart?

Thank you in advance.

Hi there,

I am using fvwm-2.5.3 on a Solaris maschine. I have to use a program which
emulates ms-windows in some kind.  This program produces a window which is
always on top. I have not found a way to put other windows above this one.
This window is not shown in window list or in the taskbar either nor does it
have fvwm-window decorations.  Which really bothers is that this window
stays on top so one cannot see other windows. I attemted to put other
windows in a higher layer by

All ("Netscape*") Layer 0 100000 

which raises Netscape-windows above all other window except this special
one. 

I tried to run this application with CDE which can put other windows above
this one. So it is not impossible.

Any suggestions how to handle the depth of this window?

Thanks in advance.

Uwe

Look for

	RaiseOverUnmanaged

in the manpage. Short answer: Issue

	BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged

in your .fvwm2rc

Great. I've almost finished printing 87 pages of
crappy looking html;)

Why would you want to prevent the user from moving the window, even
a splash screen?  

Even though the user can't yet do anything with that application
(since it's starting up), the user might want to do something else 
(with some other application).  Making that difficult is _not_
user-friendly.

Hi.

I've been thinking about this one, and I just saw your newsgroup
post, so I figure you're getting anxious.

Does Ctrl-Alt-Escape help?

For your information, the latest 2.4.x man pages on the web are at:

  http://fvwm.org/generated/manpages/

Some bad man2html output is fixed and features like cross-linking added.

How can I configure the pager window so that it behaves as before?
(I just upgraded to FVWM version 2.4.6 (by upgrading to Debian 3.0 (woody)).)


Specifically, it used to work like this:

- if I raised it, it went into stay-on-top mode;

- if I lowered it, it lowered and partipated normally in the z order 
  until I raised it again.  (That is if I lowered other windows, it
  might end up on top of them, but I could re-raise those windows 
  and it would remain behind them until I raised it directly and it 
  reverted to stay-on-top mode.

Thanks.


Daniel

Ive noticed thqt menus brought up w/ mouse button 2 become real windows if
held down long enough. How do i turn that off? Switching the button 2
command w/ button 3 still leaves the effect on button 2, so it's the button,
not the command.

Also, holding down a mouse button for a while, say on a scrollbar, casues a
beep.  Is that fvwn's doing? Can i turn it off?

Thanx

When i open an xterm on the fvwm desktop, i get

I just found clicking the right button scrolls everything
down, and the left button click scrolls everything up.

Is there a way to give the left mouse button a 'drag' action?

This has nothing to do with fvwm. This is how the scrollbars in the
toolkit
(Athena, libXaw) that Xterm using behaves. You can drag using the middle
button.
Or you can use another terminal emulator (such as rxvt or
gnome-terminal) that has scrolling on the left button.

As you found out, its selecting the title with button 2.
Its a feature under development (you must be using a 2.5.x beta release).
Dominik has indicated the feature isn't done yet.

Its not fvwm.  I don't see it, so I don't have any ideas about turning
it off, sorry.

   when starting fvwm 2.4.8 (debian unstable) on vncserver 3.3.3r2 I get 
bunch of errors even though the keys are valid, as verified by xev and 
also by fvwm - they actually work!

   here are the error messages:

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86Standby
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86AudioMute
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86AudioLowerVolume
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86AudioRaiseVolume
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86AudioPlay

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86Search
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86HomePage
[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> No such key: XF86Start

   here's example of config (all the lines are like this one, just 
different key and different text after -T):

Key     XF86AudioNext           A       A       Exec exec xterm -T next

   and it gets even stranger: when I run xev (just run it, not hitting 
those keys while it's running) the messages disappear - next time I 
start fvwm on the same server it works! yes, I tried to restart fvwm 
before I run xev, the messages are there everytime it is started, until 
I run xev.

   these bogus messages are NOT printed when using X 4.x (XFree86)

   any ideas?

   TIA

hi russell,

button two ( middle button ) drags; it also makes the scrollbar 'jump' to
any part of the scrollbar if you position the cursor there and just click
it. fyi, the amount of scrolling done by buttons one and three is
proportional to your distance from the top of the window. i.e. clicking at
the top end of the scrollbar will scroll up or down one line at a time, in
the middle will scroll half the screen at a time and at the bottom the whole
screen at a time. so you can scroll up and down without having to move your
mouse. it really is extremely well thought out - i wish all scroll bars
worked this way :)

siegfried.

I just found clicking the right button scrolls everything
down, and the left button click scrolls everything up.

Is there a way to give the left mouse button a 'drag' action?

No, FvwmTaskBar is not designed to be swallowed. You may swallow
FvwmIconMan instead.

Or you may use the latest 2.5.4 (from cvs) snapshot. FvwmTaskBar now has
the launch buttons support.

Mikhael.

Thanks for the hint. RaiseOverUnmanaged only was not sufficient. I used 

BugOpts RaiseOverUnmanaged True, RaiseOverNativeWindows True

Sometimes if i switch from one desktop to another, fvwm (2.4.8-3) 
drawn a window there that belonged on the previous desktop. I can 
bring this window to the foreground, after which no other window can 
be put on top of it, but I can not type in it, or move it, or click 
any of its title bar buttons. Restarting fvwm doesn't make this 
window go away, so I need to exit and restart the server.

Anyone seen anything like this? This behaviour started only recently, 
but its onset does not coincide with any upgrade/mod to my system 
that I know of.

Hello,

Consider the following Desktop:
 __________________________
| __________  ____________ |                 
||          ||            ||
||          || window2    ||
|| window1  ||____________||
||          |  ________    |
||          | |window3 |   |
||__________|  --------    |
---------------------------

window1 and 2 are as big as they will get. Now I open a small window,
window3. I would like to tell window3 to occupy the rest of the space.
That should look like this:

 __________________________
| __________  ____________ |                 
||          ||            ||
||          || window2    ||
|| window1  ||____________||
||          ||------------||
||          || window3    ||
||__________||____________||
---------------------------

Is fvwm able to to this ?

I had mailed about this like a couple of weeks ago, but it doesn't
look like my mail made it to the mailing-list.  In any regard, let
me broach the subject again.  I grabbed an fvwm snapshot (back in 9/16)
and then again 9/26 and compiled them without a hitch, but the colormap
is all freaky on me (gotta love that description :-)  Simply put,
without making any changes to any of my setup files, my emacs and icons
are very different in tone/color.  A case in point, the clamp.xpm is
yellowish in color when it should really be brown.  If I invoke 'xv'
from the command line and look at clamp.xpm, it looks fine (its brownish).
I don't have any "colormap" commands in my .fvwm2rc file (FWIW).

I'll attach a small example of what I'm talking about.  Even the rcalc.xpm
(also noted in the jpg) instead of having a gray edge has a redish one.

I looked at the Changelog to see any mention of 'colormap' and downloaded
a few snapshots in between any mention of that word to see where the
problem started happening for me; here's a summary,

 + snap-20020926: exhibits the same problem (colors look wrong)
 + snap-20020916: exhibits the same problem (colors look wrong)
 + snap-20020904: exhibits the same problem (colors look wrong)
 + snap-20020831: exhibits the same problem (colors look wrong) 
 + snap-20020815: exhibits the same problem (colors look wrong) 
 + snap-20020810: exhibits problems, different form (more faded)
 + snap-20020805: exhibits problems, faded + FvwmPager is green-puke color
 + snap-20020731: exhibits problems, faded + FvwmPager is green-puke color
 + snap-20020720: exhibits problems, faded + FvwmPager is green-puke color
 + snap-20020715: Works great
 + snap-20020501: Works great

So it might be this change that is causing the problem,

            * libs/PictureUtils.c (PictureRGBtoPixel):
            (decompose_mask):
            Fixed(??) color allocation for some visuals

BTW: the icons noted in this email can be found here,

  http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/project/windowmanagers/lib/fvwm-new/icons/

  uname -a : SunOS pez 5.7 Generic_106541-19 sun4u
  gcc -v   : gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)

Anyway of reverting back to the "normal" colormap look ?
