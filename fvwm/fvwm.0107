Hello together,
I'm new to this pretty intriguing WM.

I'm tinkering with the configuration file and I have a question for you:
I configured FvwmButton region at the top of the screen having the
StaysOnTop property  and I'd like to have all the windows use only the
region of the screen not covered by the FvwmButtons module.

Now, if I maximize the windows, the title bar falls under the button region
and it is unaccessible, so that I always have to move each window down and
resize it.

Is there a way to specify a Style for this? Or using the X resources is the
only solution?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Sergio Nasi

Some of the apps (Galeon) used to have veery long titles that force
WindowList to look ugly. Is it possible to implement some kind of
title folding/cutting?

This is very cumsy snapshot:

Here I am again,
I found out about the problem I wrote about below that fvwm provides a
Style command named "MaxWindowSize" that could do the job.
I'm using fvwm 2.2.5 and the parser gives me a "Bad Style parameter" error
when I use it in my .fvwmrc file like this:
Style "*" MaxWindowSize 800 500
(even tried 800p 500p).

Any hints?

Thank you

Regards

Sergio

Style option MaxWindowSize was added in 2.3.3, it is not available in
2.2.5.

You may use (don't forget 'p' if you want size in pixels):

  Style "*" MaxWindowSize 800p 500p

But this does not prevent any window to overlap FvwmButtons.
Or another (almost the same) solution is to give parameters to Maximize:

  Maximize 800p 500p

Since your FvwmButtons is at the top, there is no acceptable solution for
you in the latest version. If it was at the bottom, the solutions with
limitting a size above would be ok for you.

You may highly reduce chances of overlapping by having your FvwmButtons
some layers up:

  Style FvwmButtons StaysOnTop
  Style "*" MinOverlapPlacement

I think fvwm-ewmh patch at http://fvwm-ewmh.sourcefourge.net/ enables to
define a working area, something that you want, but I don't know for sure.

Mikhael.

Yes, you can do something like that

*FvwmNetHints: MyStrut left right top bottom

Where  left,  right, top and bottom are positive or
null integer (pixels) which defined 4 bands:

One on the left of your screen of width left
One on the right of your screen of width right
One on the top of your screen of height top
One on the bottom of your screen of height bottom

Then, if you replace the fvwm Maximize command by the FvwmNetHints
one (SendToModule FvwmNetHints Maximize [options]), when you maximize
it is assumed that your screen is your real screen minus the 4 bands,
the so called "Working Area".

You may also use the experimental option:

*FvwmNetHints: UseWorkingAreaPlacement True

which causes new windows to be placed again to respect
the "Working Area" (you should not use any manual placement).

I failed this trap several times. It is not much harmful for me, because
their javascript does nothing to my browser, but I can see what it does...

I guess I should use sf.net alias to reduce typos.

Hi. I tried to start fvwm, but there was an error message:;
'cannot open display'.

I know it's not much, but I'm a new linux-user, so I would appreciate any help.

I'm using redhat 7.1 with kernel 2.4.5

Thank you

Possible problems:
- no X server started
  How did you log in?
  What did you execute in order to start fvwm?
- X server is started by another user, that user did not allow
  "actions" on the X server
  How did you log in?
  What did you execute in order to start fvwm?
  Are there other users logged in? If yes, how?
- DISPLAY environment variable with wrong contents
  Try echo $DISPLAY to check that
- ...

	Hello,

	I hope I am writing to the right place ...  If not, sorry!

	I have recently switched (back) to FVWM from GNOME, and am
generally happy with everything.  The one thing I _really_ want to fix,
and which may sway me back to GNOME, is the way FVWM is handling my
graphics windows.  I use a local program, physica, which brings up it's
own graphics window to make my pretty plots; whenever I switch
pages/desks, or even just place another window on top of this graphics
window, the graphics disappear and I'm left with a blank window (when
placing other windows on top, only the area covered is lost).  When I work
with small files, this isn't a problem because I generally use macros, but
sometimes it takes 20 mins to analyze stuff, which is far too long just to
look again at what I've already analyzed!
	I realize physica (see www.triumf.ca/physica/html/homepage.html if
you care) is not a world-renowned program, but perhaps you're familiar
with CERN's "PAW"  (physics analysis workstation) program?  The same thing
happens with it's graphics window.

	Thanks in advance,
		Dan

It's not the job of the window manager to save the contents of windows
when they're obscured: it's the job of the application to redisplay its
contents when it gets the appropriate event.

If physica can't do this without recalculating everything from scratch,
it's _seriously_ broken.  You should ask them to fix it or get a better
tool...

Anyway, you can have FVWM ask the X server to try to cache the contents
of windows using the BackingStore and/or SaveUnder Style options; see
the fvwm2 man page.  This must be what GNOME is doing if you don't see
this behavior there.  BTW, what WM were you using with GNOME?  GNOME is
a whole desktop environment, not just a WM.  At work I run GNOME with
FVWM as the WM.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

sometimes when i think an fvwm2 window has focus (i.e., it's turned to
the focus colors) i still can't type at it, because the mouse pointer
is over the scrollbar for the window.  moving the mouse just a bit into
the window text area fixes things.  thinking about this, i've probably only
seen this with xterms, but it might happen elsewhere -- i forget.

is there a setting that gives focus no matter where the mouse pointer
is?  

for the record, i get the undesired behavior on 2.2.4 on linux.  i get
the behavior i want with fvwm2 version 2.0.46 on solaris, and i think
on a similar vintage version running on linux.

thanks very much...

	OK.  I'll give the BackingStore and/or SaveUnder a try ... if not,
I'll get Joe Chuma to fix it from physica's end.

	Yes, of course; what I should have said was "GNOME running

This is an issue with the Linux version of xterm.

It doesn't happen with the Solaris version of xterm,
or any version of rxvt.

If you want to get xterm fixed, you should contact the authors.

In the mean time, you might want to switch to one of the many
xterm replacements.  rxvt suites me.

interesting.  i thought i'd been using the same xterm for a long time
now (i usually build my own, to avoid system incompatibilities), but
i'll take your word for it.

thanks,

Hi

I like the mwm style of icons, in which the icon is not partly 
transparent but it is just a solid box with a picture in it. 
(Also like in cde.) It is possible to get someting like this
in fvwm, when one uses --disable-shape for the configure 
script. However, then when 
loading a partly transparent icon, the transparent part appears
black. Is it possible to set a color for that? Also I was 
wondering if it is possible to set a fixed size for the
box that is drawn around an icon.

best regards

jos

I'd like to control the overall brightness of the monitor, e.g. dim down at
night.

So I make a colormap with my desired colors, and ask fvwm2 to  put this
colormap in effect.
I'm using the prescribed X functions in the Xlib programming manual
(A.Nye).

But fvwm2  seems to ignore the call  ( XSetWindowColormap )  and refuses to
install my
colormap. So nothing happens, not even an error message.

1)  Is there a trick to tell fvwm2 to use a particular colormap ?

2)  Are there other approaches to dim down the ( whole ) monitor in SW ?

thanks

I haven't tested it, but it looks to me like you can
use the "DefaultColors" command to choose something other than
black.

Clipping an icon to a set size is not currently supported.

There were questions along the exact sames lines on Usenet
just recently.  Sorry, I couldn't give a definitive answer there either.
You might want to check in with P.Eftevik <pef@trasra.no> so see if
he made any progress.

Solaris supports the Xcms extension:

http://www.funet.fi/pub/X11/X11R4/DOCS/color/Xcms.text

which looks like it might do what you want, but after reading
thru the above, I'm less sure.

I have seen Fvwm use private colormaps, so I think  Fvwm is doing what
it should.  You would have to post some  code to show  us what you are
doing for further help with XSetWindowColormap.

I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but here goes.

some macro names have been changed in libstroke-0.5:

MAX_POINTS -> STROKE_MAX_POINTS
MIN_POINTS -> STROKE_MIN_POINTS
MAX_SEQUENCE -> STROKE_MAX_SEQUENCE
SCALE_RATIO -> STROKE_SCALE_RATIO
BIN_COUNT_PERCENT -> STROKE_BIN_COUNT_PERCENT

fvmw-2.4 won't compile with libstroke-0.5 unless those are changed.

Hi,


I am trying to compile fvwm-1.24r on solaris 8 Box.

OS: Solaris 8
GCC: gcc 2.95.2
XPM: xpm 3.4k

error:

gcc -O -Xc -xF -xcg92    -I/usr/openwin/include  -Dsun -Dsparc -DSVR4
-DSYSV      -c  CatString3.c
gcc: unrecognized option `-Xc'
gcc: language cg92 not recognized

All library build fail this way. Was wondering if this is a know issue,
and possible work-around.

Thank you.

Using  fvwm1 is  a   bad idea.  (In  my opinion.)    There is  no  one
supporting fvwm1.

Fvwm2 uses configure so you won't run into this problem.

Your xmkmf config files are set up for Sun's compiler.
You can adjust them to gcc or override CCOPTIONS from the command line.
(You may need to use gnumake to get the override to work.)

Is there a way to disable the alt/tab functionality in fvwm2?  Something 
I can do in the fvwm2rc file, that is.

I'm guessing that you are using fvwm 2.4.0 and want to remove the
key binding.

Its in the man page under "BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS".

You want:

Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


Hi,

it sounds like I can't compile with gnome support. I found this out
when trying to configure fvwm, which tries to compile this
(in ./configure):

#line 5911 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"

#include <gnome.h>
int main(int c, char **v) {
   /* we can't really run this outside of X */
   if (!c) gnome_init("test-app", "0.0", c, v);
      return 0;
}


and there is a conflict between stdio.h and gnomesupport.h which
redefines sprintf and vsnprintf as if they weren't part or standard
include files already :


configure:5921: sgifwcompile -e -q -nostdinc -I.

  extern int    vsnprintf(char *, ssize_t, const char *, /* va_list */ char *);
                ^

a more straightforward compile command gives the same result :

cc -I/d3/myroots/proot/usr/freeware/lib32/gnome-libs/include
-I/d3/myroots/proot/usr/freeware/include
-I/d3/myroots/proot/usr/freeware/include/gtk-1.2
-I/d3/myroots/proot/usr/freeware/include/glib-1.2
-I/d3/myroots/proot/usr/freeware/lib32/glib/include -o conftest -c conftest.c

Here are the offending prototypes :

stdio.h:
extern int  snprintf(char *, ssize_t, const char *, ...);
extern int  vsnprintf(char *, ssize_t, const char *, char *);

gnomesupport.h:
/* Maximum chars of output to write is MAXLEN.  */
int snprintf  (char *, size_t, char *, ...);
int vsnprintf (char *, size_t, char *, va_list);


just wanted to know if anybody already encountered such a
problem, cuz I have no clue where to look at in the first
place. Any ideas ? Why aren't they "extern" in gnomesupport ?
Can I just fix gnomesupport.h ( I guess not...)


Thanks!
Stephane

Just to make it clear. This configure check is unique to FVWM, gnome.m4
does not contain it. I added it because a lot of users have a non-working
GNOME instalation, usually an incorrect gnome-config or header files.
gnome.m4 does not detect this, like in your situation, so I enhanced it.

The GNOME libs support (not to be confused with GNOME WM hints) is only
used in FvwmGtk module and is fully optional. It only determines whether
FvwmGtk is a gtk application or a gnome application. It is almost safe to
say that you will not lose anything without "GNOME support in FvwmGtk".
For example, our rpms have no such support not to be dependent on GNOME.

Sorry, I am not a GNOME developer.
I would like to know if there is anything FVWM can help in this situation.

This goes back to a thread that is several months old where a fix was
generated for the fvwm window manager to fix a slow popup dialog box in
Perl/Tk apps. The fix was based on a similar problem discovered in
Tcl/Tk (I don't know any of the details). I'd appreciate hearing
directly from anyone who can shed some light on this. I'll post this to
other groups too. TIA


Has anyone else seen this? 
 
 
I have good circumstantial evidence that this change to fvwm2 causes
some sort of problem with at least one Tcl/Tk app. This could be a
problem in the application, Tcl/Tk, an incorrect fix for fvwm or even
mean that Perl/Tk needs a change for the original problem.
 
The application 'tkcvs' is a Tcl/Tk GUI interface for CVS. Most times,
but not always, when one selects a file and then selects the Commit
button, a window opens for the reason to be entered and then abruptly
closes. CVS commit is not done. I've been using the same version of
tkcvs for many months and this symptom just began showing up after we
converted to Solaris 5.7.

I have other TkCVS apps (like TKDIFF in the same package) that do not
show this problem.
 
It is very difficult for me to debug TCL apps, but it appears the
problem occurs in a call to TKWAIT after the commit prompt window is
created.
 
Upgrading to the latest version of tkcvs makes no difference.

The problem seems very consistent on both Linux and Solaris systems.
 
Upgrading to fvwm 2.4 (where the fix has been applied) makes no
difference.

Removing the fix in fvwm (events.c) FIXES the TkCVS problem.

 
Versions:
  TCL tcl8.3.2
  FVWM 2.4 or 2.3.31 with patch
  TkCVS 7.0 or 6.3b3(something like this)
  Solaris 5.7

Could you by any chance tell us *which* fix you are talking about?

In events.c around line 2125 (fvwm 2.4 source) you  will see 

	cre->value_mask &= !CWStackMode;
	cre->value_mask |= (ecre->value_mask & CWStackMode);
	cre->above = ecre->above;
	cre->detail = ecre->detail;
	/* srt (28-Apr-2001): Tk needs a ConfigureNotify event after a raise,
	 * otherwise it would hang for two seconds */
	new_g = Tmp_win->frame_g;
	do_send_event = True;
      }
    } /* while */
  } /* if */


Removing the new_g and do_send_event allows TkCVS to behave, but brings
back the Perl/Tk slow dialog problem.

Ah, yes.  TkCVS maps a new window, asks the window manager to
raise it and gets a ConfigureNotify in response, can't handle it
and closes the window.  While responding with a ConfigureNotify to
a Raise request is not really covered by the specs (ICCCM2), the
application should be prepared to receive a ConfigureNotify at any
time and handle it gracefully.  I can't tell if this is a problem
in Tk or the application, but it should definitely be reported to
the TkCVS developers.  I don't know what fvwm could do
differently other than creating a new style that allows control
over sending/not sending events.  BTW, the hanging Perl/Tk dialog
boxes are also a Perl/Tk bug that should be reported.  Since a
number of applications have similar problems (e.g. xemacs), the
fix should still stay in fvwm's code.

Thank you !!  I'll report this to the TkCVS folks as well as Perl/Tk.
Thanks again for the analysis.

Hello, I'm working on an xfree86 touchscreen driver that works with fvwm.
I'm not sure if this message belongs here or someplace else but I figured
that the window manager developers would probably be the experts to ask.
What I'm trying to do is make the behaviour be that:

If user touches a 'button' (like a close button) a down event is generated
and then immediately after an up event is generated.  But if the user touchs
some other part of the screen (say to drag a window) I only pass a down
event (until user lifts finger).  XFree86 seems to just pass events to the
window manager.  When a button gets pressed I know there is a different
graphics (indented button) that gets displayed, I'd like to 'hook' this(or
something) so that I can tell if the user hit a button or someplace else.

The problem is that now, if i do a down/up mode, the user can't drag, which
kinda sucks.

Hello,

It doesn't seem IBM Java 1.3 takes into account the
FVWM2 borders when calculating frame size.

For example, when I run my application in a 640 x 480
environment, and set my application frame to be size
640 x 480, the application is shifted so that the
title bar is offscreen and so is the left border.

Is this a known problem?  Any work arounds?

Thanks,
Paul

This shows up in Sun's bug parade:

4401846

They've marked it as commit to fix in "Tiger" (whatever that is).

I'm not sure what relationship this has to IBM Java 1.3.

As long as the touchscreen driver generates button down, motion, and
button up events, it should work with fvwm.

I don't understand the part about 'hook'ing the button being depressed.
Fvwm depresses the button when it sees the button down event, but considers
the button clicked when the button is released and a little time passes.

Thanks for the help.  I searched bug parade but only
found a bug reported against Java 1.1.  This one is
against 1.3.

Thanks again,
Paul

        If he's talking about IBM's 1.3 JDK for Linux, he may not have
seen the problem with some other port of 1.3, say Blackdown's. Though it
theoretically shouldn't be so, I've definitely noticed that different
bugs seem to crop up in different implementers' ports of what is
supposed to be the same release.


Cheers,
Bob

You must be wrong!  We are talking about software written by big,
professional companies, not the trash open source kiddies like us
are writing ;-)

You don't need to hold down the button to drag windows with fvwm.
Try out this binding:

  AddToFunc ClickToMove
  + C Move

  Mouse 1 T A ClickToMove

Now you can click once on a window title to start moving a window.
A second click terminates the operation.

Hi, I have this enhancement request:

I use different desktops for different tasks, e.g. desk 0 for
mail and www, desk 1 for development.

When I'm switching among the desktops, I usually want to go to a
different page as well (I have 3x4 pages), like I'm on the page 1
0 on desk 1 and I'd like to go directly to 0 0 on desk 0 because
that's where I was last time.

Imagine I have a terminal with a long compilation on desk 1, page
1 0 (quite a common situation ) and I want to be there
automagically when the compilation ends and it beeps and I press
the button that gets me to desk 1. And all that regardless of
where I was on the other desktop, reading fvwm news while the
compilation was in progress. 8-)

Maybe the attached diff of my quick-and-dirty solution will help
if my previous text is not clear enough.

(I'm not on the list so please cc your replies to me.)

                            Jacek Kopecky

(I apologize I forgot to specify the subject last time, so I'm
resending it properly now. If you read my mail with no subject,
you need not read this one.)

Hi, I have this enhancement request:

I use different desktops for different tasks, e.g. desk 0 for
mail and www, desk 1 for development.

When I'm switching among the desktops, I usually want to go to a
different page as well (I have 3x4 pages), like I'm on the page 1
0 on desk 1 and I'd like to go directly to 0 0 on desk 0 because
that's where I was last time.

Imagine I have a terminal with a long compilation on desk 1, page
1 0 (quite a common situation ) and I want to be there
automagically when the compilation ends and it beeps and I press
the button that gets me to desk 1. And all that regardless of
where I was on the other desktop, reading fvwm news while the
compilation was in progress. 8-)

Maybe the attached diff of my quick-and-dirty solution will help
if my previous text is not clear enough.

(I'm not on the list so please cc your replies to me.)

Hi, I just read the FAQ for my favourite 8-) virtual window
manager and it seems the big question 0.1 is actually answered by
the answer to 5.5. Maybe the answer to 5.5 should be moved to the
answer to 0.1.

Anyway, just a suggestion... 8-)

Dear List,

This question is probably a simple one, but I have
been puzzling over it for days. 

Is it possible to tell FVWM that when a window is
maximsied, that it places the window at the top left
hand corner of the screen, and that the bottom line of
the window appears "x" distance from the bottom of the
screen, and that the remaining two sides of the
window, fill out to touch the sides of the screen.
Does this make sense???

Thankyou for your help,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

In your case, you may have this function MyMaximize:

  DestroyFunc MyMaximize
  AddToFunc   MyMaximize
  + I Maximize 100 -48p $0        # x = 48

Use MyMaximize instead of Maximize, it gets one optional argument
"True"/"On", "False"/"Off" or "Toggle" (the default is "Toggle").

In the fvwm-ewmh patch, which will be integrated to fvwm sometimes soon,
there are other commands to change the behaviour of the Maximize command.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Why did OpageResize got obsoleted from 1.x to 2.x?

Starting from 2.3.8 there is a style option called ResizeOpaque, use:

  Style * ResizeOpaque

Then the Resize command behaves as you expect.

Hi,

I can't seem to get Alt-tab window cycling work the way I like it (fvwm
version 2.4.0). "Next (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Focus" stops at the last
window in the list, I want it to focus the first window in the list again.
In addition I don't want it to change the winlist order (just keep the
order in which the windows were created).

Is this possible in fvwm?

Thanks!

Sander
