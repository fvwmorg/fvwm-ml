Hi People!

I'm fairly new to fvwm2, and I have a question about ButtonStyle (don't be
going, yeah, yeah, here we go again)...

I put in the following into my .fvwm2rc:

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon

ButtonStyle 3 (PixMap Logo.xpm)

ButtonStyle 6 (PixMap Minimize.xpm)
ButtonStyle 6 InActive (PixMap Minimize-D.xpm)

ButtonStyle 4 (PixMap Maximize.xpm)
ButtonStyle 4 InActive (PixMap Maximize-D.xpm)

ButtonStyle 2 (PixMap Close.xpm)
ButtonStyle 2 InActive (PixMap Close-D.xpm)

Hoping to get Buttons 1 and 3 on the left side and Buttons 6, 4, and 2 on
the right side.
The problem is that when I run it, I get only these in the following order:
Button 1 on the Left, and Buttons 4 and 2 on the Right.

Am I doing something terribly wrong? Any help appreciated.
                                                        -Pat

        Hmmm...do you have anything bound to the buttons that aren't
showing up? If I recall correctly, FVWM won't bother displaying buttons
that aren't bound to anything.

   My guess is you have not defined any actions/functions
   with buttons 3 and 6.  Try "binding" mouse actions to
   those buttons.  Like:

      Mouse 0   3       A        WindowShade
      Mouse 0   6       A        Lower

   Hope this helps,

Patrick ...

Well, after a lengthy absence for the sake of moving from Denver to the
Bay Area, I'm back into fvwm hacking, only this time it's on a Linux-
running laptop. It also means that I don't have to second-guess every bit
of code or patch I mail out, for fear of corporate lawyers.

Gee, anything big happen since early November? Besides the Broncos, I mean.
Already heard 'bout that.

Subject: FVWM: Fvwm icons disappear after RedHat 5.0 upgrade.

Hi,

I'm using the same ~/.fvwmrc file as before my upgrade from RedHat 4.2 to
5.0.  I had it set up so that only the titles of the icons were used, and
so that they stacked up in the lower right part of the screen.  After the
upgrade, when I iconify windows, they disappear - I don't have any icons at
all, so there is no way to recall a window.  It's kind of annoying.  I
noticed a few other messages about fvwm here, and changed:

PixmapPath /usr/include/X11/pixmaps/
IconPath   /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/

to

PixmapPath /usr/share/icons
IconPath   /usr/share/icons

in both the system.fvwmrc and ~/.fvwmrc with no luck.  I'm using version
1.24r, and my .fvwmrc file is included below.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

-R

Try checking colour availability.  I've found that in most cases where icons 
were disappearing, it was because I'd run out of colours.  Run xdpyinfo, and 
make sure you're getting the right kind of screen depth (this'll probably be 
16, 24 or 32 bits truecolor; if it's only 8 bits pseudocolor, then that's 
probably your problem).  It may be something else, of course, but it's easy to 
check for colours.

I've been using fvwm 2.0.46 for several months and have 2 nits:

First, it seems to not be possible for focus to be set on an iconified 
window.  In twm, it is possible to send keystrokes to a window through 
its Icon Manager button, whether the window is iconified or not, but
not in fvwm.  I talked to the FvwmIconMan author about this, he seemed 
to believe the problem is in fvwm proper.  I tried to play around in
gdb, but only managed to wedge myself trying to debug fvwm while it
was managing my session.  Is there some sane way to do this without
locking things up?  My XEmacs gdb window lost focus while fvwm was
stopped and I was completely hosed.

I was looking at the lines
 
>   if((Fw)&&(Fw->flags & ICONIFIED)&&(Fw->icon_w))
>     w= Fw->icon_w;
 
from fvwm/focus.c, thinking this might be the problem, but Fw->icon_w
seems to be NULL when IconMan is managing the window.  

Second, I have keystrokes bound to switch between desks.  When I
switch desks and the mouse lands in a non-sticky window, that window
gets focus.  However, if it lands in a sticky window, the window does
not get focus (no window gets focus).  Is this a known bug?

Sorry if these have been answered previously.  I tried to look through 
the archives on your web pages, but they are miserably slow from here.

Any help with these issues would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know
if you need additional information.  And keep up the great work!

Below is an excerpt from my /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/.fvwm2rc.  I'm hoping to 
swallow oclock and xbiff in aother 2 high row.  I'm having trouble 
getting it working _with_ the xclock digital swallow.

My second problem involves the number of desks I have.  I want to have 
only one Desk and then DeskTopSize 3 3 or something else reasonable.  I 
don't like not being able to drag windows around.  I can't find where 
the desks are getting made to 4 in the .fvwm2rc.

Thanks for your help...

Why doesn't

	+ BorderStyle InActive Solid Green

make the window border Green when the window is inactive?  Is there any
way to specify a solid color for inactive borders within a Decor, or is
it always necessary to specify a `Color' attribute directly in each Style
line that uses the associated Decor?

        Quick Answer:  Look for lines in menu definitions that look 
something like

+          "Pager (2 desks)" Module  FvwmPager 0 1

and change them all to specify "FvwmPager 0 0", so the pager only shows
1 desktop. Then find all the "*FvwmPagerblahblahblah" statements. You should
see "*FvwmPagerLabel 0 Some Title", "*FvwmPagerLabel 1 Another Title", etc.
Lose all but the first one (this step isn't really necessary, but it'll look
cleaner). Lastly, excise any functions that invoke a desktop switch, and any
StartsOnDesk Style definitions.


        The Truth:  What I said above is really a lie. There is no
such thing as a fixed number of desktops - the desk is an arbitrary X
property that can be assigned to a window, and a window manager may be
gracious enough to do something useful with it. What we're doing above is
creating the appearance of having only one desktop, by removing any 
references to multiple desktops from your .fvwm2rc.


        - Bob

   Hmm... at home I have had 2.0.45 running for about 2 months
   continuously and at work I have 2.0.46 running for about a week
   or so but I have yet to see such messages.

   I hardly reboot or shutdown my machines.  At work I am only
   forced to reboot in order to get to Windows every once in a
   while.

Some windows which launch on my fvwm ( in particular some child popups
of 2 main applications ) come up with incorrect initial window size.   I
have 2 which are too big and cross multiple screens and one which comes
up very small.  I am running on sun Sparc and Ultra  Workstations using
sunos 5.5.1 and fvwm 1.24.   I am reasonably confident that this is a
problem/feature of the applications as they are part of a family of
products we use.   The main point is that, under dtwm, the windows open
ok.    Anyone know of a way to make fvwm "get it wrong" like dtwm or
failing that,  the sort of problem I might look for in the application
code?

[debugging fvwm with gdb]

As you've found, it's quite hard debugging a window manager :)

What I do is run gdb within an xterm (possibly even within an "emacs
-nw" in the xterm).  I do a "secure keyboard" to do a keyboard grab,
and then fear no more from the window manager :) It's clearly not a
suitable way of debugging the keystroke processing logic, however.
For that, I have the luxury of virtual consoles under linux: I leave
the gdb on a text console.

Look at the window using "xwininfo -size".  

Look at all the  size hints, but  specifically see  if the  window has
defined minimum and maximum aspect ratios.

As I remember, the last time we saw this, the minimum was greater than
the maximum.

You need to use the Style command.  You might try something like the

AddToDecor A

Style A UseDecor A,Color etc.


Style "My Window" UseStyle A

Whenever I want to debug a window manager or similar X app, I simply use
the Xnest server.  That works _MUCH_ better and is not nearly as
difficult to use.

Under Linux, I often run a second X-server on console 8 when I'm
debugging fvwm2 or SCWM; don't try it unless you have at least 20MB of
main memory, but if you do, it's a real joy.  A second machine is also
an option for some (and is the only option besides Xnest on machines
which won't run 2 X servers).

this may not be an fvwm issue but a general X issue, but i've only 
recently had to worry about it and i'm not sure where to find the 
info... it's not in the fvwm FAQ.

how do i adjust/disable the screensaver timing?  right now, i need 
to turn the screensaver off for demo purposes, but it'd be good to 
know how to change the idle time before the screen blanks.

thanks,
  richard

First, "xset s off" will I think shut off the screensaver.

Look at the man page for xset.  It probably will lead you to think you
can't control the blanking time (not sure).  In which case you'll want to
shut off the native X screensaver (again, with "xset s off" I think) and
replace it by running xscreensaver, which judging by the contents of its
defaults file in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults can do all that and more.

I'm having trouble getting my mouse focus to work the way I'd like it to.
I'm currently running fvwm-2.0.46 and tkgoodstuff8.0-final on a solaris
box (sunOS 5.5.1). What I'd like to be able to do is have my mouse focus
switch when I click anywhere in a window. 

I have a feeling this is probably answered somewhere already, but I
couldn't find it. If this is a duplicate question I apologize, and would
appreciate if someone could point me in the direction of the answer.

I originally had the following in my config file:
Style "*"        BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4, MouseFocusClickRaises, NoIcon

But I had trouble using tkgoodstuff with this. Any time I moved over the
tkgoodstuff button bar, it grabbed the focus, even if I didn't click in
it. Ok, so that's bearable. But then I would click on an icon, go to that
window, and tkgoodstuff would minimize itself -- _but_ grabbed the focus
again in doing so. So all my typing after tkgoodstuff minimizes went to
/dev/null...

So I tried the following:
Style "*"           BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4, SloppyFocus, NoIcon


Which works with tkgoodstuff and I don't lose my focus on a window. The
problem is that I want to be able to click on a window and bring it
to the foreground (which only works if I click on the title bar, borders).
I tried adding the following, but it meant that any click was always
interpreted by fvwm2, which isn't any good after the first click:

Mouse 1 WTSF  Raise


Is there a way to:
A) Click once to raise a window, subsequent clicks are interpreted by that
window? (under SloppyFocus)

B) Make the focus stay on the current window, _even if_ I move over the
tkgoodstuff space? (under ClickToFocus)

1- Mini-Icons setup:

 The samples provided don't make good use of the mini-icons.  Can anyone
 suggest .fvwm2rc files and scrrenshots on the web with nice setups ?

2- Tkgoodstuff:

 I want to use the very nice TkGoodStuff WindowList Client
 (scrrenshot: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff/win95.jpg)
 from tkgoodstuff8.0-final as a module for fvwm-2-0.46
 
 I tried in ~/.fvwm2rc :
 
 ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2:/usr/local/lib/tkgoodstuff
 
 Style "tkgoodstuff" NoTitle,BorderWidth 0,NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip,CirculateSkipIcon,CirculateSkip
 
 AddToMenu Module-Popup	"FvwmModules"	Title
 + "tkgoodstuff" Module tkgoodstuff -f /home/rhogee/.tkgoodstuffrc
 
 But invoking tkgoodstuff as a module fails silently.
 
 Should this work?  Has anyone tried it and succeeded?

Thanks!

It should work I`m one version short of tkgoodstuff final but I got it run
as a module no problem, 
Things you might try are:
	make sure /usr/local/lib/tkgoodstuff/tkgoodstuff is executable
	next try and run it by hand (it had the wrong location for wish in
mine, if this is the case vi the file and change the first line)
	then move your rc file to ~/.tkgrc -- the file that is read by
default and start the Module as 
			Module tkgoodstuff


Hope that helps, if it doesn't lent me no what those things do and I'll
try again

Good Luck,
Brad

 I would like to have some way of moving a window currently on another
viewport (of the current desk) to the current viewport through a fvwm2
function, with the window appearing in the same relative position on
the current viewport as it was on the old one. I'm aware that fvwm2
doesn't currently support this and I'd have to modify the source code;
I'm wondering if anyone has done this before, or if anyone can point me
at where and roughly what to fiddle.

 I suppose it might be doable through an external program or script that
forces the window around, instead of hacking fvwm2. if someone has done
this (or has a good idea of what to do) I'd be interested in details.

 Why I'd like to be able to do this: I manage my xterms through
FvwmIconMan and (for them) want the old fvwm1 StubbornIcons feature.
Since FvwmIconMan can run a fvwm function to (de)iconify things, I could
recreate StubbornIcons by a 'deiconify; move window to current viewport'
sequence[*].

	- cks
[*: it would probably even work reliably if I could grok what I needed
    to do with 'Current' to have the function only work on non-iconified
    windows. This may be a FvwmIconMan/fvwm interaction issue; Current's
    idea of the current window may not be FvwmIconMan's idea of it. My
    current code attempts to refocus on viewport of the de-iconified
    window with
	Iconify
	Current [!iconic *] Focus
    but that doesn't seem to work, so I'm just Focus'ing all the time.
    Possibly I am just misreading how to use 'Current'. Help welcome.
    I don't think I can get FvwmIconMan to apply one command to iconified
    windows and another to non-iconified ones on the same button press, but
    again I may not be grokking FvwmIconMan right.]

 Boy is my face red.
 Aided by someone pointing out that I actually had a reversed idea of
what fvwm1's StubbornIcons option did, I discovered that fvwm2 already
can do exactly the result of what I want; it's the StickyIcon style
option.

 My apologies. We now return to your regularly scheduled mailing list
traffic.

I'm at it again

after the success of my previus enhancement (ok no interest at all)
I've made another.

this should be usefull if you have several windows with program sources
and headers.
you can put the sources windows bellow the corresponding headers.
(headers are *.h | *.H sources are *.c | *.cc | *.C | *.cpp)

I use nedit and I use to do this by hand in every programing session

You can download it and see more details in my page at geocities:

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/4456/FvwmCascade_csort_diff_en.html

I could put it here but it's a bit long (almost 7K).

 If you have FvwmIconMan's sort option turned on, and the second window
in the icon manager's current order changes its icon name (or whatever
one is using as the label) such that it should be first, it is not
resorted into the front position; it stays where it is. This doesn't
happen for the third and subsequent windows, and I think it's due to an
off-by-one bug in modules/FvwmIconMan/xmanager.c. Patch enclosed.

 While we're on the subject of FvwmIconMan, it would be nice if
there was an option for whether to make the sort order comparison
case dependant or independant. At the moment it is hardcoded to be
case-independant.

I am using Fvwm Version 2.0.46 on linux.

I can login from the console and startx, and fvwm2 with no
problem.

When I set the runlevel to 5, and try to use xdm for login,
I cannot login to my user accounts - fvwm fails to start.

An .FVWM2-errors file is generated with a bunch 
of cryptic errors like this:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module
'^?ELF^A^A^A' in ModulePath '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'

and on and on with random non-printable garbage as non found
modules.

Can somebody here tell me whats going on and how to fix it?


thank you,

cliff

I know this isn't exactly what you all are involved in, however I was
wondering if any of you know of a Linux utility to increase the
sensitivity of the mouse in Xwindows  (specifically I have a PS/2 port
mouse).

This is probably not your problem, but one thing you should check is your
/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession, which might be looking for a file called .xsession
in your home directory.  Back in the day (pre RH 5.0) .xsession was a
symbolic link to .Xclients.  Now, depending on what you've been up to
there, you might have to create that link yourself.  Assuming you are
using .Xclients as your startup file for X.

cd
ln -s .Xclients .xsession

   See the man page for xset.  Look at the mouse settings.

This looks suspiciously like fvwm is reading an executable file or a
module as if it were a config file.  Look for something like `fvwm -f
<blah>', where <blah> is a file or module name.  I suspect there's an
older version of fvwm (or perhaps fvwm95) that uses `fvwm -f FvwmCpp
<filename>' or `fvwm -f FvwmM4 <filename>'; this use is old syntax
(deprecated as of fvwm-2.0.43).  You may need to replace this with
`fvwm -cmd FvwmCpp <filename>' or `fvwm -cmd FvwmM4 <filename>'.

: and on and on with random non-printable garbage as non found
: modules.

Hi,

  How can I set certain windows "not resizable"?
i.e. I don't wanna allow some sticky windows -- like xclock, xload
... - to be resized.

Thanks in advance.

Hi.

I'm using fvwm2 now on my SGI Indy (moved over from fvwm95, as it
happens).

I'd like to be able to use the SGI desktop icons aswell. However there's
a problem in that the icons get the left and middle button clicks, but
the right button is only handled by the window manager, whereas I want
the icons to get the right clicks if the mouse is over one of them.

Has anyone ever dealt with this problem?

Or, failing that, is there a way in fvwm2 to use icons as shortcuts to
files (as you can under the SGI desktop/Win95 etc.) rather than just as
iconized windows?

Are you sure you haven't got a function defined for the right mouse button
when the mouse pointer is in the root window ?
That's the only reason I can think of, why the left and middle mouse
buttons work OK, but the right one doesn't.

As far as I know, nope. You can't.
But a while ago, somebody posted a path or module that enabled file managing
right under our very fvwm2.

I did, but removing it didn't help.

I think you'd have to edit the source code for that particular
application. FVWM honors the maximum and minimum size requests that
applications make, but I don't think there's any way you can pull it off
from within FVWM.

You can remove the titlebar, and/or the handlebars which provide the obvious 
ways of resizing them (and reduce screen estate wastage).  You'd still be able 
to resize by going to the menus, though.  (Assuming a standardish 
configuration; you could remove resizing from all menus except those 
accessible from windows which you want to be able to resize, I suppose.)

What are you trying to achieve?  i.e., how much work is it worth?

Hello,

I was browsing through the Fvwm FAQ and have updated information to
supply. I also discovered no email address for the maintainer for the
FAQ. (The suggestion is that there should be one so that FAQ updates
do not have to clutter up the mailing list.)

The information is an updated URL for Rxvt/Rclock. The official
Rxvt home page is at

  http://babayaga.math.fu-berlin.de/%7Erxvt/

There you will find links to the latest source for both Rxvt and
Rclock in the same distribution. (The source at the URL listed in the
FAQ is old. Rxvt is now up to version 2.4.5.)

I have vague recollections of encountering this in the past. The drag
and drop desktop functionality is provided by a daemon called
objectserver. IIRC this daemon grabs left and middle mouse clicks
and does its own thing with them. Right mouse click is passed to the
window manager unharmed.

Imagine you are running 4Dwm. On an open area of desk left mouse
rubberbands an area of desk. Middle mouse pastes text. Right mouse
is passed to the WM, which pops up a menu. So you could emulate
this by not using left and middle in fvwm, but bind right to an fvwm
menu.

It may be possible to change the behaviour of objectserver. Read its
documentation and let me know if you find anything :-)

Good luck.

 twm has a very useful feature where if you click Button3 while placing
a new window it, well, let me quote the manpage (which says it better
than me):
	Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button)
	will give the window its current position but attempt to make
	it long enough to touch the bottom the screen.
(twm clips the new window size based on sizing constraints, obviously).
I find this a really convenient thing for easily creating large windows,
must faster than placing and then resizing and much more convenient than
having a large number of 'create (this|that|the other) in (80x24 80x50
80xwhatever)' menu options.

 Inserting this in fvwm2 likely requires source code hacks, since I
don't think I've seen any options to control how window placement is
done (not even an option to turn off keyboard control of it, which I'd
just love[*]). Does anyone have suggestions on the best place and way to
add this option in the fvwm2 source? Is there a clever way of achieving
this in fvwm2 as it stands? Has anyone already done this?

	- cks
[*: people who are heads-down typists, like me, can get hit by the
    asynchronous nature of new window placement stealing our keyboard
    input halfway through a sentence we're typing; one can even have
    a new window placed inadvertently if a return keystroke is stolen
    at just the wrong moment. Since I don't normally use the keyboard
    placement, I'd love an option to turn it off.]

Objectserver has nothing to do with this.

The thing that runs the icons on the desktop is "fm"; you can start
one up by hand with "fm -b" if you don't currently have any icons on
your desktop.

I don't know of any way to get the SGI icons to notice the right mouse
button - they ignore it under the default window manager (4Dwm) as well.
Any particular reason you need to use the right mouse button on these
icons?

Hi all,

   I admit that I didn't do much research on this question but
   I can't see any thing in my ${HOME}/.fvwm2rc that would cause
   this.

   I recently noticed that when using xv to open images that are
   bigger than my Virtual desk size fvwm2 will force the xv image
   window fit this size.

   My question is:  Is there anyway one could disable this behavior?

   TIA,

Patrick ...

In the normal SGI setup, the right mouse button pops up a menu, which
contains extra items if the mouse is over a selected icon (eg. open
icon, put away icon).

There's a bug in FvwmTaskBar which prevents it from correctly parsing
pathname of user-specifed mail inbox.  Here's a little patch to
FvwmTaskBar in fvwm-2.0.46 to fix this problem.  I don't read the
mailing list (just the archives), so e-mail me if there are any
questions.

I guess you're right about that.
Fvwm is very configurable, but not completely programmable :)

> not even an option to turn off keyboard control of it

Sure there is !
There are 2 possibilities:

1) Use something like
Key A C Left CursorMove Left (or something alike, I don't remember by heart)

2) You could use xmodmap (if available on your system) to completely map
the mouse to the keyboard.
Then, you won't even need the mouse _buttons_ because they're on the keypad
already.

As far as I know, nope.

> [*: people who are heads-down typists, like me,

Just try practicing a lot - it really helps !
I usually am a head-down typist too, but I try as much as I can to
force myself looking to the screen instead of the keyboard.
It does take some patience, if you're (just like I) used to looking to
the keyboard when typing.

Hope this helps,

I guess that answer to that depends on how much you want to hack the xv
code.  That is its not fvwm its xv that is your problem.  From what I have
seen in the xv source it basically starrts up creating an image window the
size of your screen.  Then it loads the image if the image is smaller than
the screen great it makes the window smaller, if its larger then it does a
resize to get it to fit on your screen.  

Now depending on which window manager you are using this is a good/bad
feature.  If you are using something like mwm that doesn't give you pages
then you'ld be out of luck viewing the rest of your image.  As for a fix
to this problem I don`t know, the xv source is not fun to look at.

Its not fvwm2 forcing the limit,  its, xv.  You want  to start xv with
the command line option -nolimits.

Can someone clarify for me what FvwmButtonsPixmap is supposed to do?

I thought it might put a background behind the icon labels, and around
them instead of the solid padding colour, but it doesn't seem to.

(fvwm 2.0.46)

I have tried those several times, they seemed to have no effect at all.
But maybe that's just me :)

It works up to a point. If you have a very simple buttonbar without
containers or padding it seems to work, but it can't cope with more
complicated structures. Also, it doesn't seem to work with swallowed
apps.

Could this be because the container code was added after the pixmap
code? Probably needs a bit of a rewrite.

Nothing to do with fvwm.  You are seeing documented xv behavior.  xv
will internally keep you image at the original size.  However, you
need to be careful when saving an image - to retain the original size
you need to select ``Normal Size'' in the ``Save'' dialog.

Maybe.  What do the xv docs (usually ``/usr/doc/xv/xvdocs.ps'') say?

   Thank you for all your answers!  -nolimits works perfectly!

Hi,

Can I make my FvwmButtons should be "Double-Clicked" (not
"Single-Cliked") to launch some application? 
(I'm sorry if it's one of usual questoins.)

Thanks in advance!

                command you specify. You can tell xcmd to run commands
                that create their own windows (using `--xcmd'), or to
                run commands inside a terminal window (using `--cmd')

I'm not surprised that it doesn't work with swallowed apps, but I have quite
a simple buttonbar (no containers) and it still doesn't work.

Probably.
It should be possible, so I guess there's indeed a little "bug" in the
algorithm.

 If one is willing to try other image viewers, I am fond of xli,
especially with the patches for shared memory and PNG and better JPEG
support that you can find at http://pantransit.smar.reptiles.org in
the programming section. Among other virtues, it lets you pan around
images too large to fit on the screen in a reasonably convenient way.

 It's purely an image viewing program (with limited ability to tweak
things like image gamma on the fly), not an image manipulation program
like xv. If you need to manipulate images in complex ways or save the
results of even simple manipulation, you want xv or something more
capable.

 xli itself should be available from ftp.x.org in one of the contrib
subdirectories.

Here's something that I use:

    Key KP_Enter	A	A	warp-or-run "Netscape" \
	    Exec /usr/local/bin/netscape -ncols 100


DoXtermButtons

    Searches for an application named "XtermButtons" (ignoring the
    fact that XtermButtons has CirculateSkip style).  If found,
    passes it to FocusAndWarp (see below).  If not found, spawns the
    FvwmButtons module to bring up the window.

FocusAndWarp

    Raises the specified window, gives it focus, deiconifies it if
    necessary, and warps pointer to center of the window.  (Helper
    function)

warp-to

    Cycle through the named windows using FocusAndWarp

warp-or-run

    Either FocusAndWarp the named application (if found), or uses the
    remaining options to run the application.


The Key definitions rebind some of the keys on my numeric keypad to do
the following:

    /		Focus on XtermButtons, or run a new copy if not found
    *		Cycle through my existing xterm windows
    -		Cycle through my existing editor (XVile) windows
    +		Focus to my mailer, or run it if not found
    Enter	Cycle through exiting Netscape windows, or spawn a new
		copy if not found

Here's what I use:

} Key F2		A	C	NetscapeFunction
} ...
} DestroyFunc Goto
} AddToFunc Goto \
}   "I" Iconify -1
} + "I" WindowShade 2
} + "I" Focus
} + "I" WarpToWindow 50 50 
}

}   "I" Next [Navigator] Goto
} + "I" None [Navigator] GotoPage 0 1
} + "I" None [Navigator] Exec netscape -install -geometry =624x800-120+86


It works as you describe.  However, I have trouble getting 'Next' to
work with FvwmButtons - the following doesn't work as I expect.  I
get additional instances of FvwmButtons each time the function gets
executed.  Fvwm doesn't produce any error messages while defining or
executing the function.  Any ideas why this doesn't work?

} Key F4		A	C	ButtonFunc
} ...
} DestroyFunc ButtonFunc
} AddToFunc   ButtonFunc \
}   "I" Next [FvwmButtons] Iconify 
} + "I" None [FvwmButtons] Module FvwmButtons

A lot of configuration files set FvwmButtons to CirculateSkip, which
means that "Next" won't find it.  Try:

  "I" Next ["FvwmButtons" CirculateHit] Goto
+ "I" None ["FvwmButtons" CirculateHit] Module FvwmButtons

Looks like CirculateSkip was the culprit - it works now.
Thanks for the tip!

2. How do I get 9 work areas in a desktop? I have 3 desktops
with 4 work areas in each. I am not able to create more work
areas.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Does anyone know how to turn OFF the default behaviour where transient
popups (e.g. open file dialogs) always stay on top of the main
window?

I've RTFMed, checked the FAQ and searched this list's archives and was not
able to find an answer.

thank you,

Add a line to your ~/Xdefaults file, similar to this one:

XTerm*font:	10x20

using whatever font you like, using the full x-style name, or nickname
like the above.

For more on XTerm resources, "man xterm"

You can't.
These fonts are not set by fvwm (as far as I know).
Refer to your .Xdefaults file or something alike since
this is a matter of X.

Hope this helps,

>From the FAQ:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
26) You can bind mouse movements to keystrokes, how about mouse
    presses?

A: Hm.  This one is a little tougher.  It could be done, but many
   programs ignore synthetic events, which is what would be generated.
   In X11R6.1 there is an extension (called XKBD?) which can do this,
   but I don't want to code to anything specific to one of the newer
   X11 versions like this.  You could try using Xse, which is a
   program to interface to XSentEvent, available at ftp.x.org.  It
   could probably be used in a smiliar manner to xcb above (or in
   conjunction with it).  If anyone comes up with good examples for
   this, please send it to the fvwm mailing list for inclusion here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After several requests for help and a week or two or maybe a month or
even a year, I finally got this answer courtesy Erik Fortune
<erik@erik.org>.  Please put it in the FAQ, it will save someone a lot
of pain:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
>From the X Window System FAQ:
Subject:  36)! How can I control the mouse with the keyboard?

If you have the X Keyboard (XKB) Extension, you can enable mouse keys,
which makes it possible to generate mouse motion and button events
using the keyboard.  Events generated by MouseKeys are completely
transparent -- they will work with any application that connects to a
server that has the X Keyboard Extension, regardless of whether the
application itself uses XKB.

XKB is enabled by default in X11R6.1.  

First, set up the Num Lock key so that Shift+Num_Lock toggles mouse
keys:

 xmodmap -e "keysym Num_Lock = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys"

(XFree86 3.1.2E is based on R6.1 and has the X Keyboard Extension; it
also has a binding to Pointer_EnableKeys in its default keymap.  You
use Alt+Shift+Num_Lock to toggle MouseKeys on and off.  If you are
using an earlier release of X or XFree86, you won't have XKB and the
instructions will not work. See http://www.XFree86.org/FAQ for more
information.)

You might also have to turn off server num lock for this to work.  Now
press "Shift+Num_Lock" to enable MouseKeys.  When MouseKeys are on:

o)   The keypad arrow keys move the pointer
o)   The keypad '5' key behaves like the 'default' pointer button
o)   The keypad '0' key locks the default pointer button (for easy dragging)
o)   The keypad '.' key unlock the default pointer button (to release a drag)
o)   The keypad '+' key double-clicks the default pointer button.
o)   The keypad '/' key sets the 'default' button to Button1
o)   The keypad '*' key sets the default button to Button2
o)   The keypad '-' key sets the default button to Button3

This is the default configuration, but the mechanism allows for nearly
infinite configurability.

The mind boggles.  This is one company that's not getting my business.  
Assuming the above is actually true, this is almost as bizarre as the 
occasional email from individuals to the tix-info mailing list asking about 
tickets for some Disney ice show (Tix is an extension to Tcl, providing a nice 
package of widgets).

    I just recently switched over from fvwm 1.24 to fvwm 2.0.46. I have 
seen a couple of differences and was wondering whether it was a
configuration issue or whether the code was different.
    The first thing that I noticed when I switched over, was the operation
of the mouse buttons on the root. I have a different menu set up on each
button. In fvwm 1.24, the menu would only appear as long as I held down
the button. In 2.0.46, I click and release the button, and the menu stays
there until I click a second time. Can I configure this to work like
fvwm 1.24  did?
    The other thing I noticed, is that the pager in fvwm 1.24 used to display
the window titles in it. It does not seem to do that in 2.0.46. How do
I change that?
    The version I am running is the compiled version that came with
FreeBSD 2.2.5. Please send your responses to me via emai, as I am not
on the mailing list. 

Thanks
Keith

It looks like the problem is the placement of your PixmapsPath line.
The docs claim that .fvwm2rc is no longer dependant upon order as in
1.24, but there are still some things where the order matters. Try
moving your Path definition lines to the top of .fvwm2rc. As for docs,
try hitting the FVWM site at http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/. Full
manpages are distributed, as well as links to samples. The site also
maintains a link to the tkgoodstuff8 home (last I checked) though
tkgoodstuff has been orphaned by its developer. The docs should be
available from the site, all the same.

Try changing your - - HiddenHandles to -- HiddenHandles.  As for the
"couldn't load pixmap error," make sure your PixmapPath is set correctly.

Hello,

	I have compiled the fvwm for the first time.  However, I don't have the
fvwm code itself to run my .fvwm95rc.  To verify my question.  I am
currently running vtwm in order to run my .vtwmrc.

You mention ".fvwm95rc",  if you are   running fvwm95, you  are on the
wrong mailing list.

You mention, "fvwm",  there are 2 versions  of fvwm around, if you are
running fvwm version  1,  the config file  is  ".fvwmrc".  If you  are
running fvwm version 2, (fvwm2) the config file is ".fvwm2rc".

You seem to be using the word "run" for 2 different purposes.  I think
you mean, I currently "run" vtwm which "reads" my .vtwmrc.

I know I  am  being picky,  but  I  hope by  helping you   phrase your
question more clearly, you will get a better answer.

Hi Every one:

I hope some one can solve my simple problem.
We use fvwm2 as our window manager. We start 2 applications, one on Desk
0 and another one on Desk 1. 
The problem I have is: 
If the current window is on Desk 0 and second application started on
Desk 1, the keyboard focus is lost from the current application when
Application program is started on Desk 2.(I use StartOnDesk option)
Is this a FVWM problem or the problem of Application ?
Here is part of the .fvwm2rc that I used:
# Focus Setup

Style "*"       ClickToFocus

# Misc. Setup

ClickTime       150
OpaqueMoveSize  100
EdgeScroll      0 0
EdgeResistance  0 20
Style "*"       MWMFunctions, MWMDecor

# Window Placement

Style "*"       SmartPlacement
Style "*"       RandomPlacement

# Virtual setup

DeskTopSize     1x1

# Styles

Style "*"       NoTitle, NoHandles, NoIcon, SkipMapping, BorderWidth 4

Style "uidisp"  StartsOnDesk 0, CirculateSkip, BorderWidth 0
Style "trx_ui"  StartsOnDesk 0, BorderWidth 0

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec xpmroot
/usr/felix/icons/big_highway.xpm &
+               "I" Exec pos_startup &


Any suggestion is welcome.

I am new to Linux and recently installed Redhat 5.0 (Linux kernel
2.0.32).  Everything is great but I have problems with FVWM
(v1).  When I exit FVWM the top 90% of the screen is filled with
a solid pink-purple color and the machine is locked up.  I can't
ALT-Function key to another vterminal or do anything but turn off
the power.  This is running on a Pentium 133 (Intel VX chipset)
with 64MB RAM and a Diamond Stealth 3D 3000 (S3 ViRGE) with 4MB
VRAM.

Anyone have any ideas what is going on?

Thanks

-Gary

I had the same problem, and it's located somewhere in the video
board. If you try to reset the board, it will sometimes (1 out of 3
approx) lock itself up. We haven't given it any more thought, other
than, replace the damn' thing.

I just tried testing out a new fvwm, version 2.0.46, and am having a problem
with it; it usually hangs when I try to restart it.

After fiddling with my config file, I try to restart to get that to take
affect.  I pull up the root menu, seletc exit fvwm, then select restart fvwm
from the appropriate menu.

When it restarts, the mouse pointer never changes from the left arrow that
it becomes when the menu comes up; the menu never gets unmapped, actually,
fvwm decorates the popup menu! (It gets a border and titlebar, labelled
'untitled') 

At this point it becomes fairly useless; I can't focus windows, can't switch
monitors, etc.  I can't even get my key sequence I bound to exit fvwm, so I
have to walk to another mahcine, then come in remotely and kill the process
that way.

FYI, I'm doing all of this on solaris 2.6 on a sparc 5.  Any help would be
appreciated; it looks like it has a lot of nice features, but it seems just
to unstable to use now; I guess I'll have to stick with 2.0.42 for awhile
:-(

hi everyone, i've got a question that i can't find a good answer to on the
webpage.

i'm using fvwm1, and i'd like to have it perform SmartPlacement on my ICQ,
but if i try to define it as a style using the window title (my icq#), it
tells me that SmartPlacement is a bad style command.

any suggestions would be appreciated because ICQ launches WAY more windows
than i'd like to drop by hand (all other placements are commented out.)

thanks

jon

AFAIK, fvwm-1.X doesn't grok SmartPlacement; it was something added to
fvwm-2.0.40+.

I'm currently using fvwm2-2.0.46-8 and I have previously (in old fvwm)
used:
  EdgeScroll 0 0
  EdgeResistance 0 20
to disable edge scrolling except for moving/resizing windows.

This doesn't seem to work in my current version of fvwm, my windows
refuses to move across the screen edge. I haven't found any info on this
problem but noticed the following in the Changelog:

2.0.46
  ...
       36. Made window move paging match Edgescroll values instead of
           always doing full screens (should this be an option?)
  ...

Could this patch have to do with it? Is there a solution?

Thanks,
/Mats

Try EdgeScroll 100 100 to switch screens
EdgeScroll 0 0 will "disable" virtual desktops

Hi:
	I am encountering a problem.  I like to know how to set
height and width for WinList button in .tkgrc, and how to set
spacing between the rightmost WinList button and my other tkgoodstuff
client button(icon).  WinList is the 2nd item following pager.
	Anothet thing is that I am using a sparc20 running SunOS 4.1.4.
When I put some fancy icon on tkgoodstuff, I start to see message like
can not allocate colormap, and start to see faded color on new application.
I have used reduced icon, it helps to some extend.  Is ther anyway I can
do to get around this problem without removing those nice icon ?

Thanks

Hello,

Is there any way to specify a default color/hilightcolor for iconified
windows?  I'd like to have the text color for a window title white and the
text color for iconified windows black without making special style
directives for each application and without using the iconbox.

Sorry if this is a RTFM question; I've done some digging and couldn't find
anything that covers this.  If it's out there, though, pointers to the
manual to read would be appreciatd.

Thanks,
Karyl F. Stein

Zzzzzzzzzzzttttttt!  Thanks for playing.  fvwm-1.2x groks
SmartPlacement as a top-level config directive, but not as a style, e.g.:

    # (in .fvwmrc)
    # This is all-or-nothing; you can't have SmartPlacement for
    # some windows and `active placement' for others.
    SmartPlacement
    RandomPlacement

while fvwm2 groks this:

    # (in .fvwm2rc, or whatever you've chosen to call it)
    # You can restrict this to only the windows you want in fvwm2,
    # unlike in fvwm-1.2x.
    Style * SmartPlacement
    Style * RandomPlacement
    Style

This is on fvwm2.0.46 running under HP-UX 10.01.

I've recenly noticed an annoying interaction between FvwmButtons
and FvwmPager that I'm hoping someone can help me clear up.

I have a single FvwmPager running which is swallowed by my button
bar my the following:

(4x3 Padding 2 0 Swallow (UseOld,Close,NoKill,Respawn) FvwmPager "FvwmPager 0 0")

I noticed the other day that I had a whole bunch of (like 10)
FvwmPager processes running.  I killed off the extras, but a few 
hours later, I again saw more than one process running.  After
a little digging, I discovered that every time I use button 2 in the
pager to change the location of a window, a new instance of the
pager gets spawned even though the old one hasn't died.

I just brought up a non-swallowed pager and didn't see this behavior,
so I assume FvwmButtons is the culprit.  Can anyone shed any light
on why this might be happening?

TIA!

Hi,

I'd like my windows to behave somewhat more like the Mac, in that when
clicked they come to the front.  Can anyone tell me how to customize
my .fvwm2rc so that this happens?

thanks,

When focus-follows-mouse is set and you're focused on a sticky window, 
changing desks results in no window having the focus, even though the
sticky window remains under the mouse.

The code in fvwm/virtual.c (function changeDesks) has a bit of code
commented out which as far as I can tell does the right thing.  There
is a cryptic comment indicating that it doesn't work.  If someone
could explain it I would greatly appreciate it.  The only thing I can
guess is that it might be buggy due to the variable StickyWin being
static in the function.  I uncommented the code and made StickyWin
non-static and it all seems to work right.  I can't see any problem
with sticky click-to-focus windows.  Am I missing something?

thank you for your time,
Greg

ps - Could you please include me directly in followups.  
     I am not on either list.  

Also, I sent a few patches last November and December and have not
heard anything.  Would it be possible to get some feedback as to
whether these have been accepted?

Finally, on your TODO list on the web you mention you'd like FvwmAuto
to be customizable on a per- window-{name,class..} basis.  I've got a
fvwmperl module that does this - its rather general.  If you'd like to 
include it I'd be happy to let you have it.

Near 2000, Wesley Hart mumbled something about:
> 
> (4x3 Padding 2 0 Swallow (UseOld,Close,NoKill,Respawn) FvwmPager "FvwmPager 0 0")

It looks pretty much like what I'm using:
*FvwmButtons(2x2, Swallow (Close, NoHints, Kill, Respawn, NoOld, NoTitle) "Desktop" "Module FvwmPager 0 0")

therefore, I think it's just a matter of toying with interpunction a bit.

Try using the interpunction I've been using here.

Hope this helps,

CIAO.

I am having the same problem.  Here is my entry:
(1x6,Swallow (Respawn) "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 5",Frame 0,Back firebrick3)

When ever I move a window from one desktop to another, a new pager is created.

I tired the following:
(1x6,Swallow (Close,NoHints,Respawn,NoOld,Notitle) "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0
5",Frame 0,Back firebrick3)

but received the same results.

Now my FvwmButtons configurations are in a file, but I don't think this has
anything to do with this problem.

I have had this problem ever since I went to fvwm2 (it sure seems like its been
decades ;-{}) ).

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

Apologies to those who think this is a little Win95y...

First of a bit of necessary info, I'm running fvwm 1.x on Linux 2.0.27 I'm
new to fvwm so I only have the one desk.  I also have the SurpressIcons
option running. 

On my GoodStuff toolbar I have a button to launch an xterm, call it foo
xterm, which works fine. What I want to do, is make it so that if the foo
xterm button is pressed again, it throws up foo xterm from where ever its
hiding, (from underneath other stuff on the desk, or if its an icon.) I
know that it is possible to get Goodstuff to swallow FvwmWinList, but I
don't think that would do that I  want.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Jimmy.

                `--find-<property>' options); if it finds one or more,
                xcmd will `raise' them, otherwise it will run the
                command you specify. You can tell xcmd to run commands
                that create their own windows (using `--xcmd'), or to
                run commands inside a terminal window (using `--cmd')
                with various options.

1. Check your GlobalOpts.

   do.
3. The functions associated with mouse clics are defined elsewhere in
   the init file.  Use your editor to search.

The following lines triggers a bug... (fvwm2.0.26, Sol26)

TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 14 (Pixmap ram_l1.xpm) -- Left flat
AddTitleStyle (Pixmap ram_r1.xpm) -- Right

After the first TitleStyle, I get the 'ram_l1.xpm' on the far left side,
but after the AddTitleStyle, the 'ram_l1.xpm' moves to the far right and
the 'ram_r1.xpm' moves to the center of the titlebar.

Any 'AddTitleStyle (Pixmap something.xpm) -- Right' (or Left) pastes
that pixmap in the center of the titlebar.

Anyone have time to look into it?

Subject: FVWM: FvwmIconMan bug?: selected 'window' drifting away from the mouse

From: Chris Siebenmann <cks@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu>

 In FvwmIconMan, it is possible to have the selected window in an icon
manager drift so that it is not the 'window' under your mouse; when this
happens, mouse clicks and stuff cause things to happen to it instead
of to the window under your mouse. There seems to be no way to force
FvwmIconMan to select the window under one's mouse short of moving the
mouse to another bit of the icon manager and back (or to move the mouse
out of the icon manager entirely and back in).

 The easiest way to provoke this sort of drifting is to have sorting on
and to have a window (perhaps the currently selected window) change its
title automatically and thus get resorted, perturbing the order around.
The selected window remains selected, even if resorting takes it out
from under the mouse.

 I am not certain if this behavior is a bug (although if it isn't
considered one, I think that it's at least confusing and odd). If it
isn't, I think it is a problem that there doesn't seem to be an action
function that will force the selected window to be the one under the
mouse ('select' seems to select the already selected window).

Yup, that isn't right. I'll look into it.

Here's a stupid question.  I just managed to fling a window off the desktop
entirely in fvwm2, so that it doesn't show up in the pager box at all.  I
can't see it anywhere, not even a thin line at the edge of a window.

How can I get it back?  I need a "find such-and-such window and put it back
in the center of the screen" command, so I can get to it again.

(I'm running 2.0.45 under IRIX 5.3, in case that makes a difference.)

I can't think of the "put it in the..." command, but you should be able to
access it using the FvwmWinList module.
You can bind functions to the mouse clicks there.
So you pop up the WinList and click on a mouse button to activate the
"get it back" function somebody else will have to give you.

I just thought of another *really freaky* idea:
Create a new buttonbar with only one button in there, swallowing the lost
window. Then KillModule that buttonbar. The window should be released somewhere
within the current viewport, then :-)

Hope this makes any sense,

CIAO !

Hi !!
	Would you please put me on your mailing list. I also have a question. My
compu-
ter is Pentium100, I'm running Linux version RedHat 3.0.3 and X-server is
XFree86 
3.1.2 and window manager is fvwm2rc95. My videocard is Diamond Stealth SE.
My
problem is how can i get all texts readable. The texts in windows and menus
are ok, but
when I read man-pages, all text is black and nonreadable. Other text colors
and fonts I
have been able to change from .fvwm2rc95. Please answer my question, I'm
pretty desperate.

You can subscribe yourself.  Send mail to majordomo@hpc.uh.edu with "help" 
somewhere in it, and it'll give you some help.

The colours of applications isn't set within fvwm.  Each application (like 
whatever you're using to view manpages; xman?) decides for itself what colours 
to use.  You should read its manpage to see how to do it!

Can you get a terminal window?  (xterm or equivalent.)  Does using "man ls" or 
something produce something you can read?  If so, then you're in business.

You probably need to set something in the .Xresources file, assuming that you 
have one (and assuming that it's read).  Applications tend to read the 
information which is created by xrdb when (and if, since it depends on your 
configuration) it reads that.

What happens if you run xman (or whatever is causing the problem) and 
explicitly specify the colours, like "xman -fg black -bg white"?  Or "xman -fg 
yellow -bg red", or something?

*sigh*  X11 is just too configurable to really be able to help much in these 
sorts of situations!  Especially since there are dozens of possible problems.

(Thanks for all the suggestions, everyone on the list.)

For reasons I don't understand, my version of FvwmWinList does not do
anything when I click on the window's title in the list.  If I click mb2, I
can iconify and deiconify windows on the desktop, but that's it.

I rebind all my modified buttons (shift-, control-, meta-, etc.), so maybe if
the "jump to the window" functionality is on one of these shifted buttons,
that's why I wasn't able to use it?

I think I may have failed to mention an important point in my original
message: I was moving the window in the little desktop view provided by
FvwmPager.  I clicked and held the window's representation in the desktop
view, then moved it from one portion of the virtual desktop to another,
except that I moved quickly and FvwmPager exhibited a bit of sluggishness,
and when I let go of the mouse, whoop -- the window was nowhere to be seen.

I've had this kind of thing happen more than once.  Usually I kill the
process involved.  (But this time it was a window on another machine in which
a process' output was going, and I was hoping to see the output :-).)

It may be related to load; it only happens to me when FvwmPager is responding
very sluggishly (window movements inside the pager window have hysteresis),
which happens when the workstation is loaded in general.

I don't even change them in my .fvwm2rc, so I assume I'm getting whatever the

The normal cursor on my system is an "x" outside a window and an arrow
inside a window. However when I perform a function frequently the cursor
changes to a circle. I have to click on any empty space to get the "X"
cursor back. The system then beeps.
If I forget to perform this little routine then the screen saver won't
work.

Any hints on how to get rid of this annoying little circle
automatically? Assistance appreciated.

I am currently converting the window manager for our user displays from
Motif (mwm) to fvwm.  I like the ability to have multiple "displays" for
my application windows.  The screen is just getting too small for all
the displays the users want.

What I am having a problem with is the placement of the application
windows.  I have looked at SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement and
ActivePlacement/RandomPlacement.  I have tried various combinations, but
I cannot get the window manager to allow the program to place its
windows where it wants to.  There may be several windows starting up at
runtime and I do not wish to require the user to place each one
themselves.  Also, the program has the ability to save the current
layout and thus, the windows should go back to the place if restarted.

I also noticed a USPosition and PPosition hint that can be specifed, but
I prefer not to modify already working code to add this.  And plus, my X
Window System manual says that USPosition is an obsolete mask.

I was able to get the source code and "#if 0" around the code dealing
with looking for the USPostion and transient flags.  Using just the
automatic placement works perfectly.  I would still like the other
programs to use the fvwm placement capablilities so this is just a test
fix.

What I am looking for, I guess, is a ProgramPlacement flag that would be
similar to specifiying the USPosition hint for a desired executable:

	Style "*"           RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
        Style "XProg*"      ProgramPlacement

If something like this currently exists, I would appreciate a pointer to
how to use it.  Otherwise, is this the place to request fvwm
enhancements?

Thanks.

Although I didn't have a default binding in FvwmWinList that would jump to
the window as you suggested above, you nevertheless gave me a idea for how to
solve my problem.

I added the following entries for FvwmWinList in my fvwm configuration:

    *FvwmWinListAction	Click1 Iconify,Raise
    *FvwmWinListAction	Click2 Move 100p 100p
    *FvwmWinListAction	Click3 Module "FvwmIdent" FvwmIdent

The important binding is the one for Click2.  This now allows me to bring up
a list of windows through FvwmWinList, then click on mb2 in the list to
immediately move a window to the current viewport screen.

This allowed me to regain my missing window.

Thanks for your help (and everyone else's, too).

Mike

Fvwm changes the  cursor  into a circle  when you  select an operation
that requires a window, but you are not in a window.

For example   if you select  "iconify"  from an  fvwm menu, the cursor
changes to a cirle until you click on a window.

Because fvwm is suspending everything else until you click on something.

Perhaps the source  code  could be changed to  make  the little circle
time out...

Is it possible to have shortcuts to applications on the fvwm desktop? To
my knowledge, it is only possible to have icons on the desktop that are
actively running. I would like a method for quick access to programs
through inactive icons that launch programs when double clicked
(unfortuantely, I can only compare it to micro-stuff desktop icons in
95/nt).

The below function might be modified to solve (the easiest) part of you=
r
problem:

AddToFunc Create=09I Next [$0] Iconify -1
+=09=09=09I Next [$0] Focus
+=09=09=09I None [$0] Exec $1
+=09=09=09I Wait $0
+=09=09=09I Next [$0] Focus

It is used as follows:

Key n=09A  3=09Create=09Navigator "detach netscape"

i.e. the first parameter is a name that will match (the main window of)=

the application, and the second parameter is the command line to start
it if it is not already running. When invoked, the function will
deiconify and give focus to the application if it exists, and launch it=

if is does not exist.

The second part of your problem would be to create the icons and bind
some similar function to them. Others will probably have better ideas
there; I don't use icons, and I avoid the mouse.

You might also want to look to the Xclass library distribution. The latest
version can be found at:

		ftp://mitac11.uia.ac.be/pub/xclass

When built, it contains a client called "desktop" which does what you need
it to. It sits on the desktop and creates icons. The documentation should
be clear enough and most people have no problem with the app, however you
should remember that this is alpha software (not beta).

There is also Tycoon (an OffiX desktop manager) and kfm (the file
manager from KDE, which does desktop handling).

Tycoon is much smaller (memorywise and diskwise), but kfm does more
(and looks nicer, IMHO).  Both allow drag-and-drop (Tycoon with OffiX
programs, kfm with KDE programs).

I currently use fvwm2 and kfm together, with no problems whatsoever.
With a short Perl script (to convert a file:// URL into a filename),
you can even allow dragging of stuff from kfm onto FvwmWharf buttons.

The only problem with kfm is that you have to create a kdelnk for any
application you want to add.  kfm allows you to do that easily, though
(File->New->Progam).
