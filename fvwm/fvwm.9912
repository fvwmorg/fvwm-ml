Ah, I work for HP :-)  Well, at least I used to up to the company split.
I don't need to use fvwm on an HP-UX machine though; I just thought
it wouldn't hurt if I try the patches I made for 2.2.4 on a HP-UX
machine too.  It was fairly easy with gcc, but I ran into said trouble
without it, so I thought I'd ask if this might be a problem of fvwm
itself.

Yes.  I forgot to take out some debug code before building the distibution.
In fvwm/add_window.c you will find this line:

XSynchronize(dpy, 1);

If you remove it everything should run smooth again (it not, please report
back).

There has never been a 'SuppressIcons' style as far as I know.
According to the man page there was a SuppressIcons command in
1.xx.  The corresponding style in 2.xx is 'NoIcon'.

Hi!

I'm (still) configuring fvwm, (but almost ready), and I 
have another question. 

I'd like to configure FvwmIconMan 
in such a way, that when I click on an application listed
in the icon manager, the viewport warps to the portion of 
the virtual screen where the application is located. (In the 
same manner as when I had clicked the pager on that part of 
the virtual screen.) In this way, one could quickly view 
several applications on different parts of the virtual screen, 
and find the right one. 

The problem is, that when I use WarpToWindow for this, the 
not only the viewport is changed, but also the cursor moves 
to the window. And of course I'd like the cursor to stay in 
the same place, near the icon manager. So I was wondering if 
there is a way to warp the cursor back to the previous 
position, or to maybe warp only the viewport, and not the cursor.

hope someone can help,

regards

Jos

Have you tried using the Focus command? I think it wil do what you want.

Hi!

Our sysadmin here at math.auc.dk wants to install a newer version of
FVWM (newer than 2.2.2), and he has asked me which of the 2.3.*/2.4.*
version are the most stable. I didn't know what to answer him, please

None.  Don't use 2.3.x.  The latest bug fixing release is 2.2.4, but
the differences to 2.2.2 are small.  You'll have to search a bit on the
ftp server to find 2.2.4, there's no link on the web page yet.
The latest 2.3.x releases won't make you happy, there are a lot of
serious known bugs.

Greetings,

I am an old FVWM user who temporarily flirted with enlightenment.

I have began using FVWM again because of the relatively small memory
footprint.  I also like my window manager to be as unintrusive and elegant
as possible.  I am also trying to use FVWM-2 for the first time.

I have a few picky questions:

	o Is there a way _always_ use manual (active?) placement of new 
	windows?  A quick look at placement.c said no.
	
	o Is there a way to get windows to be rendered opaque while being
        manually placed?

	o Is there a way to get windows to be rendered opaque while being
	resized?  OpaqueResize did it for FVWM 1.x.

        o Is there a way to get rid of that size/resize box that appears 
	(around pixel 0,0) when moving a window?

	o Is there a way to force focus to certain windows, such as the 
	``Netscape:Open Page'' window in Navigator?  It would be nice to
	press Alt+O and begin typing without mousing the focus to the
	new window.  Note that in most other cases I really like my
	focus to follow my pointer.

Thank you all for any insight.

I have been able to mostly catch up with real life and am actually looking
forward to a weekend with no pressing matters.  This means that I can do
some much needed infrastructure maintenance.

I will be changing xxx.fvwm.org -> www.fvwm.org soon; this should be
painless as the old site will still run while everyone's DNS expires the
old entries.

Can folks point me at other things that need taking care of?  I also want
to move the FTP and CVS servers, but this should all be transparent
(although CVS will have to go offline for a bit).

  Style * DumbPlacement, ActivePlacement

should do it.

No, because the window hasn't been properly set up yet when
you place the rubber band.

Opauqe resizing has been revived recently.  It's in the latest betas
(2.3.10 is the last one), but you won't be happy with them as we are
still several serious bugs in them.

In the latest betas the 'HideGeometryWindow' command to do this.

Try

  Style * GrabFocusTransient

(also in the 2.3.x betas).

Hi

I'd like to make an Fvwm function to make a window resize
to 'full screen'. For this I need to do two things: 1)
remove the title bar using Style "thewin" NoTitle, 2) Maximize
the window. I'd like to put this function under a key.

Now the problem: how do I pass the resource string $r of the 
window that has the focus, to a function? Just using $r like 
this: Style "$r" NoTitle doesn't seem to work.

Any help is welcome

regards,

Jos

Hi!

I'm using an alt-tab like key binding to switch between the windows 
on the current page using 'Current'. Now, I launch an Fvwmbuttons
panel at startup using Module FvwmButtons MyPanel, and I'd like to 
skip that panel while cycling the windows. I tried using this:
Current (!MyPanel), but that doesn't work, the panel gets the focus
anyway. (It does work for other windows, like xterm and FvwmIconMan.)
Also Current(!FvwmButtons) doesn't work. Does anybody know what
I could  be doing wrong?

regards,

Jos.

not sure, but why don't you do 
	Style FvwmButtons CirculateSkip
alt-tab will ignore your FvwmButtons.

Hello,

I would like to ask a very simple question:
I am running Fvwm2 2.3.10 and have X11R6.3
(with the XKEYBOARD extension) installed on
my Linux box.

I would like to simulate mouse clicks as follows:

Meta_L ---> Right Mouse_Click
Meta_R ---> Middle Mouse Click
Menu   ---> Right Mouse Click

F10 ---> Right Mouse_Click
F11 ---> Middle Mouse Click
F12 ---> Right Mouse Click

What commands should I issue from within my window manager
configuration script for these key bindings to take place?
Can I do this with xmodmap? I've heared of the

xmodmap -e "keysym Num_Lock = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys"

trick but it does not do exactly what I was looking for.

Thanks,

Neil

Hi!


I'm working on a perl script for translating blackbox themes
to fvwm2.3.10 (as good as possible). To do this, it would be
convenient if it were possible to put a scaled pixmap in the 
titlebar. I think I once saw something like this in a site with 
fvwm themes (maybe it was fvwmthemesorg) but I dont remember.
(and fvwmthemeorg is closed). Does anyone know how to do this?


Also I noticed that putting a transparant pixmap in the title
doesn't appear transparant, but black. In a button it does work.
Is this a bug, or a feature?


regards,

Jos

hi, i was trying to di exacly the same thing a few days ago (manually, not
with a script) and i noticed that there is no such thing as "ScaledPixmap",
but only "TiledPixmap" as a style to assign to your title bar, which doesn't
work quite the way we want it. but maybe the "gurus" know more on this.

This is how I have set up an Alt-Tab setting:

    Key Tab	A	M	Function NextWindow
    Key Tab	A	SM	Function PrevWindow

    AddToFunc NextWindow	"I" Next (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

    AddToFunc PrevWindow	"I" Prev (!Iconic CurrentDesk) Focus
    +				"I" Current Raise

To keep certain windows from obtaining focus, I give them the
"CirculateSkip" style, like so:

    Style "xcb"			CirculateSkip
    Style "FvwmPager"		CirculateSkip
    Style "FvwmButtons*"	CirculateSkip

mmm but this 'CirculateSkip' does it only apply to some kind of 
built-in alt-tab behaviour? (I use a 'vim-like' key binding: alt-j
circulates up (see code fragment below). Using CirculateSkip doesn't
seem to work for me, bummer...

Hey, I have an fvwm theme based on the Blackbox theme 'spiff' (kind of 
'spiff-sim') checkiddout:

  http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/spiff.jpg

the buttons however, are based on my BeOS theme:

  http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/desktop.jpg


In  the spiff-sim theme, I just use a very wide (1600 pixels) hand-made
 pixmap for the title bar (to get the combination of a horizontal 
gradient and  the horizontal 'speedlines'.) Maybe not such a good
solution 
for people with very high-res screens, though.

Writing a perl script to do automatic conversion is a bit tricky 
I think. I guess, to make in look good, the script would have generate
custom pixmaps. Maybe, the perl script could parse the blackbox setup
file, (I have this working), and then call a gimp-script for making the
pixmaps. But do do this, I first have to learn how to make
gimp-scripts...

regards,

Jos

I changed my setup to also first use 'focus' and then use 'current' to
do 
the other modifications. Now, it works.

Hi!

I tried to compile the new snapshot but got some errors. Do I need
to download some libraries? Or maybe I can turn FvwmGtk off, I don't 
need it anyway, how can I do this?

-------------

Also, when I ran .configure, an imlib dialog 
popped up containing some color settings. I didn't know 
what to do with this. When I closed it, it popped up 
again. I had to close it several times before it stayed 
closed.

I have fvwm configured (via .fvwmrc) to execute a shell script when a =
particular selection is made from the fvwm "StartMenu".  The shell script =
sets some environment variables and starts an X-Windows GUI application.  =
The GUI makes a call to XtVaAppInitialize() that causes a connection to =
the X server to be opened.  The call to XtVaAppInitialize() also causes =
the resource database for the application to be loaded by the resource =
manager.

When fvwm has to manage the GUI application window after the GUI requests =
that the window be mapped, is there any way that fvwm can get access to =
the application's resource database?  If so, please describe the way to =
access the application's resource database.

Thanks in advance.

I'm using fvwm-snap-19991205 on linux 2.2.10

I have the following line in my config

*FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page 2 0) xpmroot bckgnd3.xpm 

but switching to that page gives this error in my X server error logs

[FVWM][ExecuteFunction]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'xpmroot' 

What am I doing wrong? The pixmap exists and is in my path as is xpmroot.

You should use

  *FvwmBackerCommand (Desk 0, Page 2 0) Exec xpmroot bckgnd3.xpm
                                        ^^^^

instead to tell fvwm to use the normal search path.  Otherwise
fvwm tries to start xpmroot as a module.  Even if it were in
you ModulePath fvwm would supply it with some nonsense arguments
that are normally passed to the modules.

It shouldn't be necessary to provide gdk or any configure options.
If imlib isn't present the FvwmGtk module should be ignored
silently.

  Alex,

  depending on how you start the fvwm, it might not have the same PATH as
you have (e.g. when you start X by typing startx from command line, you
might not have X programs in your PATH). try to use the full path to xpmroot
when invoking it from menu as well as full path to bitmap.

  the other possibility is that fvwm thinks that it is a fvwm internal
command, you might need to use the exec or something like that.

That did the trick, thanks! But I had to put the full path to the .xpm as well. :-)

Any nuber of desks can be configured, with Page x y and pixmaps etc...
Try it out, and if you like it, let me know.  If there's something wrong with it
PLEASE let me know!      :-)

Sorry! Forgot to mention that the form uses features found only

I apologise for any inconvenience.

Hi,
	I would like my licq app to set in sticky mode. But I don't want
	the pop up windows from licq to be sticky as well. 

	How do I do this?

	Thanks.

Shao.

Have you run FvwmIdentify against the main windows and popup windows?

The first thing  that comes to mind  is to create  a "Style"  with the
"Sticky"  attribute that  matches  the main window  but  not the popup
windows.

On a Sun Solaris system, I have fvwm configured (via .fvwmrc) to execute a 
shell script when a particular selection is made from the fvwm "StartMenu".  
The shell script sets some environment variables and starts an X-Windows GUI 
application.  The GUI makes a call to XtVaAppInitialize() that causes a 
connection to the X server to be
opened.  The call to XtVaAppInitialize() also causes the resource database 
for the application to be loaded by the resource manager.

When fvwm has to manage the GUI application window after the GUI requests 
that the window be mapped, is there any way that fvwm can be modified to get 
access to the application's resource database?  If so, please describe the 
way to access the application's resource database.

Thanks in advance.

I saw this question  this morning, and now this  evening, but  I still
don't understand it.

What do you want fvwm to do to your application?

Fvwm doesn't normally muck around with X resources, there are tools
like editres for that.

I would like for fvwm to be able to recognize clientDecoration and 
clientFunctions resources from an application's resource database and 
provide the appropriate window decorations and functions for the 
application's window.  The clientDecoration and clientFunctions resources 
are specified in the application's default resource file.  The default 
resource file is located in a directory path (i.e., XAPPLRESDIR) defined in 
the shell script that starts the application, and the directory path is not 
readily available to the window manager.
XAPPLRESDIR for the user login session that activated fvwm is not the same 
directory path as the XAPPLRESDIR defined in the application startup shell 
script.

For example, if the application's name is app1 and it's class is App1, the 
application-specific default resource file's name would be App1, and the 
resources of interest could be specified in the file App1 in a format as 
follows:

  app1*clientDecoration: value
  app1*clientFunctions: value


The application resource file does get loaded by the resource manager, 
because the application itself can query the resource database and find the 
clientDecoration and clientFunctions resource specifications.  However, this 
resource database does not seem to be available to fvwm.

I realize that I am trying to do something that is probably out of the 
ordinary.  Perhaps, it is not possible to do this.  Any insight into the 
feasibility or possibility of doing something like this would be 
appreciated.

OK,  I'm not   an   expert on this,    but   fvwm pays  attention   to
MOTIF_WM_HINTS.   Search for "MWMDecorHints" and "MWMFunctionHints" in
the man page.  This may do what you want.

The program appres does part of what you ask for.

    appres App1

will print out the resource records that get loaded into the database
of app1.

Of course for this to work appres has to have the same environment as
app1.  You'll need to take steps to set XENVIRONMENT,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, XAPPLRESDIR, etc.  On some OSs such as AIX, flags
to ps can print out a process's environment.  Which reminds me, appres
needs to execute on the same host as app1.

Other window manglers, such as MWM, will notice certain resources in the
client's database, and react to them.  Back when I used to use MWM, I
had these sorts of resource settings:

    *oclock.clientDecoration:       none
    *xconsole.clientDecoration:     none
    *phone.clientDecoration:        -maximize -resizeh
    *xbiff.clientDecoration:        border
    *xclock.clientDecoration:       border
    *XLoad.clientDecoration:        border
    *xpostage.clientDecoration:     border
    mwm*iconbox*clientDecoration:   menu resizeh minimize

FVWM doesn't pay attention to these; it uses the "Style" directive,
which can be sensitive to the same sorts of resource names as the
application uses, so it is often possible to get the same effects,
although there is no "resource tree" capability.

I was never taught why the above worked, but just did it.  Now that I
look it over and think about it, I think the wildcards at the start of
the resource string allowed the setting to appear in MWM's resource
database, where it can pick them up.

But I dunno.  Been using FVWM too long now.  :)

Hello,

I believe I have installed fvwm2 correctly without problems, but I am 
unsuccesfull when I try and run it.  I log into a Sun machine from a 
graphical interface (for lack of better terms) and I have a choice of only 
OpenWindows/CDE.  When I populate my .xinitrc file w/ this line:

'exec /usr/local/X11/bin/fvwm2'

I get this message:


ld.so.1: /usr/local/X11/bin/fvwm2: fatal: libXpm.so.4.11: open failed: No 
such file or directory
Killed


Consequently, when I take that line out, I can log into OpenWindows just 
fine. I'm sure this has to do with X libraries (if I'm wrong let me know:), 
but I don't seem to know what I can to do solve the problem.  Would this 
indicate a problem w/ the fvwm2 installation or problematic libraries?

I installed the pkg.tgz Solaris binary package, and (as root) used pkgadd to 
install it, and it seemed to install just fine.  Any help from fvwm2 gurus 
appreciated.

The problem is that you do not have the XPM libraries instaled or at least
configured.
Try to see if libXpm.so.* is installed in the machine. If it is there ask your
system adm. to update the dinamyc library info.

If it is not there you can ask the admin. to install it. Or you can try to
recompile the fvwm without Xpm support ( I think that is possible ).

Ohhh, you are the root, then look for the xpm lib.

Bye,

The file "INSTALL.fvwm" explains what to do to fix this.
Look for "Shared Libraries in Non-standard Places".

	My bet is that you simply don't have the Xpm package installed. Where'd
you fetch the binary from, The-Archive-Formerly-Known-As-Sunsite
(Metalab)? If so, I'm certain they'll have the version of the Xpm
package that your FVWM binary was linked against, and it should install
smoothly in the standard place. I've had very good luck with their
packages. (Wish they'd upgrade to a newer version of FVWM, though.)

	I believe somebody suggested you might try building FVWM from source
without xpm support. Naaah...only as a last resort. You'll be much
happier with xpm support, and there are many other apps that need it
also.

	Note that there's a discrepancy between the package nomenclature and
that of the libraries. The package named xpm-3.4k (or something like
that - the 3.4k is the part you want to look for) will produce the
library called libXpm.so.4.11.


Cheers,
Bob

  we have solaris too and I have been able to build the xpm and fvwm without
any problems. I used gcc for that purpose. so if you have problems with
binaries you can always try to compile the sources...

As someone who is not familiar with the innerworkings of Xwindows, I'm 
trying to understand what all these things have to do with Fvwm, I'll 
include the full path on my machine for stuff so as not to confuse anyone:

1). /usr/local/X11/include/X11/xpm.h
2). /usr/local/X11/lib/libXpm.so.4.11
3). /usr/include/X11/bitmaps

Additionally, here is how I tried to compile it, and this is the output it 
gave me. It choked when it looked for a C++ compiler, so that is why I opted 
to remove the search for it.  The other stuff is just futile attempts to try 
to get it to look for the libs/xpms (I don't know what I'm talking about:>). 
  I've  included all the output of the config in an attempt to give you the 
most information possible.  I thought libXpm.so.4.11/xpm.h would be all I 
needed, but apparently I'm doing something wrong.  Also, would the 
ModulePath be the directory that contains FvwmPager/, FvwmBanner/, 
FvwmAnimate/ etc.?

Lastly, IconPath and PixmapPath are needed in the .fvwm2rc file, I don't 
have a clue where to find these, any documentation on these fundamental 
concepts would be greatly appreciated.  After having used fvwm2 at another 
company for 5 mos. I think it's worth this week of frustration. Thanks!

The ^^^^ point to an include file; the parameter should be a LIBRARY.

Yes, thats what the ModulePath is.

IconPath and PixMap path point to where you've put your icons.
You can point it right into the fvwm icons directory, but it would make
more sense to download our icons from our web site, and put them some
place like /usr/local/etc/icons.

You need backslashes on these lines, I assume you had them and just
cut this up for email purposes.  You don't point right to the files,
just the directories they are in:

--with-xpm-library=/usr/local/X11/lib
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/X11/include

For LDFLAGS, you need to export where the libraries are:

export LDFLAGS=-R/usr/local/X11/lib

I think you want --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/X11/lib and
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/X11/include.

Cheers,

  being intrigued by the post earlier today, I just downloaded icons from
fvwm page and I see that few of the fvwm banner bitmaps include cat, one
even says free-fast-feline. is there any story behind?

  I also noticed that my cats like to watch the monitor, but that wouldn't
have anything to do with that, would it? :-)))

Thanks,

that seemed to clear some things up, but I've just got another question, let 
me include some stuff.

(aaden)bart:/usr/local/X11/include$ pwd
/usr/local/X11/include
(aaden)bart:/usr/local/X11/include$ ls
./      ../     X11/    xpm.h
(aaden)bart:/usr/local/X11/include$ cd X11/
(aaden)bart:/usr/local/X11/include/X11$ ls
./      ../     xpm.h
(aaden)bart:/usr/local/X11/include/X11$

There seem to be 2 xpm.h, one is a directory deeper than the other one, this 
doesn't seem normal and I was wondering if it was a result of my multiple 
installation attempts.

Even though I attempt to use xpm.h's in different ./configure attempts, 
neither seem to work, I've enclosed relevant info:

./configure --without-cxx --with-xpm-library=/usr/local/X11/lib \ 
--with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/X11/include/X11
                                           ^^^

I get this error immediately afterwards, I don't know what it means:

configure: warning:  --with-xpm-includes=/usr/local/X11/include/X11: invalid 
host type:

  hi, guys,

  The following command in config file:

Style "aterm"		HandleWidth 2, Icon xterm-sun.xpm

  does not seem to work, the HandleWidth works but the aterm does not have
any icon when iconified. fvwm2 does not complain (no output to standdard
output) about the config file. Is there anything else I have to do? any
other ideas what's wrong?

  I have Xpm and it seems to be working (the title buttons are xpm),
programs that provide their own icons have icons (vim, netscape, ...) but
all other programs do not have icons (well, that's because no icons were
specified in config, so far)

  just in case: I use solaris, fvwm 2.2.2, exceed X server on win nt.

  TIA

	erik

  following line:

#include <readline/history.h>

  in extras/FvwmConsole 'causes problem on solaris (using gnu, probably,
readline package), the file is simply not found. however, when I comment out
the line, the FvwmConsole compiles without problems (and when I run it the
readline stuff works, I have history, can edit command etc.), so I guess it
is some difference of readline version where in our version the stuff
normally included in history.h is included in some other file...

  does anybody else have the same problem?

  (system: solaris, gcc, fvwm 2.2.4)

The xpm.h file is normally included into programs like this:

#include <X11/xpm.h>

So you don't want that last "/X11" in the include path.

(It looks like you've still got it there.)
Theres only one xpm.h file in my installation.

Get yourself a more current version of fvwm.

If the more current versions, look at:

  sample.fvwmrc/ystem.fvwm2rc-sample-95.

Use FvwmIdentify to verify that "aterm" matches the "Name", "Class",
or "Resource" as shown in "FvwmIdentify".  Watch out for things
added on to the name, "aterm 1.1" would not match.

Look for a line like this:

Style "*" NoIcon

(You don't want one.)

You might try:

Style "*" Icon xterm-sun.xpm

just to make sure you can display the icon.

Make sure your IconPath is set correctly.

  I've already made it work by setting the PixmapPath - how come the path to
icons is set using the PixmapPath? what is the IconPath for?

In the release you are  using, set both.  In the  2.3.x betas this  is
"fixed" and there will only be one thing to set, "ImagePath".

No! 'FvwmPager/', 'FvwmBanner/' are directory names. The ModulePath
points to the directory where the executables are installed.

Hi!

Is it possible to 'send keys' to an application using the
fvwm window manager? Ie. I'm looking for a function like this:

  SendKeys "window id" "Key Sequence"

This way, one could make a menu, that operates on an application
eg

AddToMenu "Options"
+ "Close" Function SendKeys "vim" ":q\r"

regards,


Jos.

Hi,

A recent news item announced the release of "Blood of the Damned", a computer game which has "a mysterious sect of bloodsuckers and baby snatchers". In another news item, Brazilian police were said to be investigating whether "Duke Nukem" induced a medical student to go on a killing spree.

One wonders what these games are teaching youngsters about their attitude towards people in the real world. I'm NOT thinking of starting a National Campaign Against Violent Computer Games (how's NACAPAGVICOMGA for an acronym) but is it too much to hope that if enough parents were to encourage their children to find better uses for the PC, the tide of violence might be stemmed?

One suitable alternative would be to give youngsters the chance to create their own sites on the World Wide Web. That is now within everyone's reach. Facilities of high quality at low cost are provided, together with free Web design tools and Internet training, at http://www.skyboom.com/amsek/.

If you like the idea, perhaps you would mention it to your friends or, better still, copy this e-mail to them.

With kind regards,

Pete Fleming

Hi!

Is it possible to squeeze the title of an fvwm window, like in twm and
ctwm?

Hi,

I found a core file in my home directory this morning and gdb says that it
is from a seg fault in FvwmAnimate.  I'm not familiar at all with this
code so I thought I'd post the output from gdb and hope someone else out
there with more experience with it would take a stab at it.  I'd love to
help right now, but I'm swamped under a huge project due yesterday...

Actually thats FvwmPager thats coring out.

The ".FvwmAnimate" that you see is the last config file it read before
starting the pager, (or something like that).

Sorry I don't have an answer to whats causing FvwmPager to quit.

Just thought I'd point out the module having the problem.

Hi,

I've been using FVWM for quite some time now and love it.  After
experimenting with other wm's, I've come back to FVWM because it's the
best. :)  However, I would like to make FVWM mimic some behaviors of the
other wm's.

I'm trying to get FvwmIconMan to mimic the following behavior.  I have
IconMan situated at +0+0 and sticky on all desktops.  What I'd like for
it to be able to do is animatedly move off of the screen (to the left)
so that only a sliver of it appears running down the LHS of the screen. 
When the mouse moves over the sliver that is visible, IconMan would
animatedly move back out onto the screen.  Is this possible w/current
versions of FVWM?  I've studied the man pages, but can't find a mouse
over or focus event handler hook.

If that's not possible, my next approach would be to simply shade or
unshade the window based on whether or not the mouse is over the
window/titlebar.  Again though, I think I'd need a mouse over/focus
event handler for that behavior.

Otherwise, I'll just learn to live with double-clicking on the title bar
to shade and unshade it as needed.  Thanks for any help you guys can
provide.

Brennan

You can move IconMan out of the viewport, but you would still see it
on the pager:

  Next (FvwmIconMan) AnimatedMove -1023p 0

The FvwmEvent module allows handling the events you want.  I've posted
a similar setup a while ago (no earlier than September).  You should be
able to find it in the mailing list archive.  Search for 'FvwmButtons'
and 'WindowShade'.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

The module FvwmEvent can be used as a focus event hook.  Together with
the PassID option and the WindowId command you can build quite
sophisticated behaviour.
Try this in your .fvwm2rc file, the 1150 number is because my screen is
1152 pixels wide, this leaves two pixels of FvwmIconMan visible.

*FvwmEventPassId
*FvwmEvent focus_change my_focusevent

DestroyFunc my_focusevent
AddToFunc my_focusevent I WindowId $0 (!FvwmIconMan) AnimatedMove -1150p
0p
+                       I WindowId $0 (FvwmIconMan) AnimatedMove 0 0

AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent

Uh, I think that it was someone saying he was looking for someone to
maintain fvwm.themes.org and that there wasn't anyone doing it at the
moment.

Hello,

i'm using a similar config but fvwm needs 1 - 1,5 seconds to give
the focus back to the actual window.
If i'm moving the mouse, the actual window gets the focus immediatly.
Any hints?

You need at least version 2.3.0 of fvwm2 for this.  If you do then maybe
your man pages aren't installed correctly or you MANPATH is wrong.

I don't understand you problem. Could you send the relevant parts of you
config? FvwmEvent has a delay option (*FvwmEventDelay), have you set
this?

This is beginning to sound very much like an AutoHide command.  Could someone
familiar enough with the code use the underlying ability noted above and
simply its specification and possibly create a true "autohide" command/style ?

It was be ideal to see something along the lines of,

   Style "Fvwm*"   AutoHide

BTW: this very much relates to PR#466 in the enhancements branch of FVWM's bug
     tracker.

Thanks

This is untested but if we the function was changed to 
AddToFunc my_focusevent I WindowId $0 (!$1) AnimatedMove -1150p 0p
+                       I WindowId $0 ($1) AnimatedMove 0 0

and 
*FvwmEvent focus_change my_focusevent FvwmIconMan

You would have a generic function that could autohide any whindow.

Hallo,
I'm new to this list.

I just updated from out old fvwm to fvwm2. FVWM2 looks really great!
But I have found a small problem, which I can't solve. 

I whould like to change the behaviour for dragging a window around.
At the momentI click, move the window and another click releses the
window.

But I would like to have the old behaviour. Pressing the mouse button,
moving the window and releasing the mouse button also releases the
window.

I read the man-Page and the mailinglist-archive, but i did not see the
answer.
Can you please help me?

Alexander

Well, first of all we need to know the actual release you are using
(2.2? 2.2.2? 2.2.4?).

This sounds as if you were using 2.0.46 or even an older release.
Since 2.2, pressing a mouse button while you move a window cancels
the motion.  So I can't believe you have 2.2.x.  If so, please
download the latest stable release (2.2.4) from our web site
(http://fvwm.org).

If upgrading doesn't help or if you already have 2.2.2 or higher,
please send me your config file so I can see what's going on.

Then I suggest you look for the XKB documentation.  It must
be described there.

You have to remove the quotes around th $r. This works for me:

  key f12 w a Function Fullimize
  AddToFunc Fullimize
  + I Style $r notitle
  + I Recapture
  + I Maximize

Note that for now you need the 'Recapture' after the style line
because the style is not applied immediately but only when fvwm
has nothing else to do.

That would be a generic enough solution for FvwmIconMan only that is abutted
to the left-edge of the screen (I think).  What I was getting at is to use
the abilities demonstrated above to simplify the creation of a true generic
AutoHide solution with no regard to a window's location (it would certainly
make more sense if it were implemented within fvwm itself instead of as user
commands).  What I was getting at is a solution that would encompass _any_
window say an xterm for example that is abutted to the top of the screen,
right-side or bottom -- all AutoHiden via the same generic command (no
user-specified pixel size moves -- ie. NO '1150p' or alike).

For example,

   Style "xterm*"  AutoHide

fvwm certainly knows the dimensions of the window in question and knows which
edge is abutted to the edge and so it would do the math as such

if ( window is abutted to edge of screen )
{
   if ( more than one edge is abutted )
   {
      find the longest edge and set it as the edge in question
   }
   find abutment direction	     /* abutted on x-axis or y-axis */
   find the opposite-direction size  /* if abutted on x-axis - find height
                                        if abutted on y-axis - find width */

   calculate hide_size ( opposite-direction-size - 2pixels )
   move/shade window in opposite-direction by hide_size pixels
}

The reason I say "shade" instead of move is due to the fact that moving a
window beyond the current visible screen would still show the window in the
pager (ie. it would be kinda confusing to look).  Ideally you'd only see a
2-pixel worth of the window (a slither if you will) on both the screen and
the pager.

Alas, as noted a _very_ generic solution is what I was after.  Ideally it
would work in the same fashion that FvwmTaskBar's AutoHide would (Olivier ?)
but be flexible enough to be invoked as a style.  Then, one would be able to
either AutoHide groups of windows "Xterm*" or just do it on a select few by
clicking on xterms and modifying their property (similar to maximize or
sticky for example)

So one could be able to,

  AddToMenu WindowOps-Popup
  +       "WindowOps"             Title      
  +       "&Move"                 Move       
  +       "&Resize"               Resize     
  +       "(Un)Stick"             Stick      
  +       "(Un)Vertical"          Maximize 0 100
  +       "(Un)AutoHide           AutoHide              <--------------

I have simplified cursor generation today: now you can use xpm
images without a hotspot. This function should do what you want:

  AddToFunc MyWindowList
  + I CursorStyle Menu empty.xpm
  + I WindowList (iconic) NoHotkeys
  + I CursorStyle Menu

where empty.xpm is any transparent xpm. This will work with
the latest CVS code only.

The next release will have the 'NoHotkeys' option.

If it's compiled in (= always), mini icons are shown as soon as
one window in the window list has one.  Do you still have this problem?

I have just written the new styles BackingStore/BackingStoreOff and
SaveUnder/SaveUnderOff.  Can you try these?  I don't see a noticeable
difference with or without them since my machine is too fast :)
I've just checked in the code into CVS.  Tomorrow's snapshot should
have it.

Wow, that's great!!

I guess, since you have taken the trouble to write the code for these, I
can take the trouble of jumping into the "turbulent" 2.3 series!  :)

I'll let you know what I find!  Thanks again!  :)

Hi!

I'd like to mimic the CDE enviroment in the
'solaris style' using fvwm2 as much as possible. This one has mwm type 
borders and has a red-ish title background color and border color when 
the window has the input focus. So in fvwm, I chose MWMBorders and I
chose the 
right background color (I used a sreenshot and gimp to determine that).

Now, the window layout looks exactly like in the solaris screenshot. 
However, the shadow and hilight colors of the border look different.
(With
this, I mean the colors that are calculated from the background color,
to 
give the borders a 3d look) So my question: is it possible to manually
set these
hilight and shadow colors?  (Ok, I'm being somewhat picky..)


regards,

Jos.

Yes, but not with the stable release.  In the current beta you can use
FvwmTheme to
create a colorset with whatever shadow and hilight colors you want.  You
then have to configure fvwm2 and the modules to use the colorset (see
the FvwmTheme man page for examples).

Cheers,
Tim.

WHat I forgot to mention: I'm not sure if this works properly.
I have no experience with SaveUnder and BackingStore.  I assumed
it's enough to set these on the frame window.  If this doesn't
help I need feedback.

If someone could come up with an algorithm that duplicates the CDE
shadow/hilight colour calculations this would be very welcome.
CDE's algo is quite clever and you can see that a lot of know-how
went into it.

What I would really like is for someone who knows Motif/CDE to write an
app that can tell fvwm what pixels CDE is using for its colorsets. That
way we would get access to the relief calculations and integration with
the CDE themes.  The app wouldn't even have to map its window, just
create it, use XmGetShadowColors() and then tell fvwm about it.  Same
goes for KDE and Gnome.

Cheers,
Tim.

----- cut -----

This will put the pager in fvwmbuttons on the left top corner (on my
1024x768).
If the pager isnt active, only a few pixels will be visible.
Moving the mouse over the pager moves full pager on the desktop.
Now my problem: if fvwm2 changes the focus, the mouse cursor sometimes
is around a second busy.
No input is possible.
Has anyone a idea?

As far as I know CDE even adapts the actual colours it uses to your
display hardware.  That is why CDE's colours look the same regardless
of the machine you have.  This is far beyond everything we tried to
code yet.

I'm trying to get an FvwmWharf button to bring up an rxvt window in a
specific directory (i.e. /mnt/cdrom/).  I've been trying to use 
"AddToFunc" to create a command that starts an rxvt, brings it into
focus and then changes the directory to /mnt/cdrom/ but I have had no
luck.  If someone knows what to do or could point me in the direction
of the man page to which I could read, I would appreciate it.

Thanks
pat

I'm not too sure about the focusing part, I think the placement and
focus model you use may have some bearing, but this might help:

AddToFunc xx I Exec cd /mnt/cdrom;rxvt

For me, the window created gets focus.

Make sure you don't have a "cd" command in your environment file.

AFAIK the matching of device independent colours to the display
hardware is done in Xcms rather than CDE.  That is in the core X11
library and so is used by FVWM already.  Of course it needs to have a
file set up for the particular video card and monitor being used.


If you really want to get the same colours as CDE, link in the Motif
library and call XmGetColors().  That returns foreground, select, and
shadow colours for a given background.  In my experience the
underlying algorithm is different in each of Motif 1.1, 1.2 (CDE 1.0),
and 2.1 (CDE 2.1).

Ah, thanks for the info.  The algorithm that lesstif uses does
indeed look like what CDE does.  Dan, do you feel inclined to
port lesstif's algorithm to fvwm?  I've attached the source file
with the code.  Look for the '_XmColorProcDefaultProc' function.

Bye

Hi,

I've always wondered (and looked from time to time) if there's a way to
get the FvwmPager not to display certain windows. I didn't see anything in
the FvwmPager and fvwm2 man pages. I would really like to have some of my
sticky items (gaim) and desktop things (xeyes and gmc desktop
icons) simply not show up in the pager. Thanx :-)
			-peace

I compiled and installed fvwm-2.2.4 without any problem. The problem I am
having is that I would like to start using fvwm instead of kde. I have been
unable to figure out out to change the default window manager from kde to fvwm.
No matter what I have done today when I use "startx" kde opens instead of fvwm.

Subject: FVWM: different key bindings in different windows

Is it possible to have different keybindings in
different windows?  I've tried putting bindings
in decor definitions and it doesn't complain :)
but of course it doesn't work either.

What I basically want is for say... F5 to be bound to
say windowlist everywhere except in a window titled
"program_that_uses_F5".

I would even settle for a function that simply allowed
me to turn off or toggle my bindings on and off
everywhere.  As the man page says, using '-' as the
function to bind to 'removes' a binding, but it
doesn't
seem to pass the key on to the underlying window
either.

thanks for your help
-matt

Which Linux distribution do you use?

I'm no KDE expert, but probably KDE is started from a file
called xinitrc or .xinitrc.  On my system, the global
xinitrc is located at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.
Usually you can override it by creating a .xinitrc in your
home directory.  All commands in this file are executed
when X starts up and as soon as the last command returns,
X is shut down.  Thus, the last command should be fvwm2.
All other commands must be started in the background.
A simple example is this:

  xterm &
  exec fvwm2

I prefer to start the window manager with 'exec' so that the
shell it is started from doesn't consume memory, but it works
without it.  Just make sure that your PATH is correct.

Bye

What fvwm version do you use?  Please provide an example.

I agree this is stupid.  I often use fvwm keyboard mappings to move the
cursor and am often itching to click with the keyboard as well.

BTW, I found this:

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/x-faq/part2/section-19.html

It suggests that Pointer_EnableKeys is configurable, but evidently
nobody has written a program to configure it.  Anyone?  ;)

I know I'm guilty of spreading this rumor too.  It's utter nonsense.
The events are *not* synthetic, and I guess if they were the
applications wouldn't care.  I've tried to write a 'ButtonClick'
function a while ago, and it works perfectly.  The reason why I
won't put it into fvwm is that this is very difficult to do right
in respect to events and module messages.  It will require lots
of carefully tinkered code that will easily break.  I've tried
it and I don't like it.  This could be written as a module, but
the fvwm core is the wrong place for it.

> I agree this is stupid.

Not really.  What is stupid is that people like you and me keep
spreading this nonsense without double checking that it's true.
The X folks are not *this* stupid.  If this rumor were true, it
would not be possible to write a 'GUI macro recorder'.

I agree, it would be great if this were easily configurable.

Dear fvwm commmunity,


what keyboard entries in .fvwm2rc do I need to access *all* windows
with (either iconofied or open) lines like

  Key Left A 4 Direction West Focus

On my laptop, I want to use only the arrow keys for moving around, but
it happens quite often that I can't change the focus at all to a
certain window.  Some windows are apparently not in the focus window
list.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I couldn't find a hint in the
docs how to do this.


    Werner

If this is working for some but not all of your windows, it may
pay to look up "lenience" in the man page.

Something which seems to be fuzzy in fvwm2.man (of version 2.2.4):

The description of `Focus' says, among others: `Raises the window if
needed to make it visible'.  What means `if needed'?  Does it mean
that the window which gets the focus is automatically raised if it is
completely hidden?  Or does it mean that the necessity is triggered
externally, e.g. by the FvwmAuto module?  If the former is the correct
description, it doesn't work as expected, at least not with key
assignments like

  Key Left A 4 Direction West Focus

Indeed, this does help.  Nevertheless, the logic how the keys are
working is, hmm, strange.

Consider the following screen layout:


   oxxxxxxxo
   +-----+
   |     |
   +-----+
   .


`o' in the left edge is the pager, `o' in the right is the clock.  The
large window is xterm (with mc running in it), the `xxxxxx' is a
small, elongated window with xterm (being a bit higher than the clock
and the pager), and the dot symbolizes an iconofied xterm (with mc).

If I click on the iconofied xterm, `Direction North' brings me to the
pager instead to the xterm window.  Why?  In the man page it is
written that `closer objects are considered a better match'.

If `Lenience' is deactivated, and I click on the iconofied xterm,
`Direction North' gives nothing, but `Direction East' brings me to the
large xterm window.

I can't follow this logic :-)  Just for reference, I've attached my
.fvwm2rc file.

Looking at the code, and with my testing, it looks to me like it would
only attempt to make the window visible if it was off screen.

I suggest you create a function that focuses and raises the window and
bind   that to the  key  instead, if   thats what you   want.  This is
untested:

AddToFunc FocusRaise
+ I Focus
+ I Raise

Key Left A 4 Direction West FocusRaise


I'm not familiar with the direction  seeking stuff, so perhaps someone
else can answer that  question.  It would  seem to me that picking the
exact window to go  to using a direction is  only going to be reliable
in controlled circumstances, like:

+---+---+
|   |   |
+---+---+
|   |   |
+---+---+

There are lots of other ways to pick the next window to use.

Hi there,

I have very recently compiled and installed fvwm2 on a Solaris 2.6 box.
I went through the instructions given in the mailing list archive to
setup the rc file and have it come up when I log in on CDE.

The only problem is that the DtHelp and DtBrowser start up as well. It
is a pain to have to close them each time I log in. can anyone please
tell me how to turn this off. Thanks.

Pradeep.

Sounds reasonable -- maybe this could be added to the man page.

Using the `Lenience' option, it works sometimes unpredictable, but I
can finally access all windows in a more or less direct way.

For use with the keyboard I could imagine a pure geometric algorithm
(note that I have not checked the fvwm2 code):

  If you go down (i.e, a `Direction south'), sort the y-coordinates of
  the top sides of all windows which are visible and satisfy all
  conditions, and move along this list.  If two coordinates are equal,
  remove all but the leftmost from this list.

Left/Right movement could be handled similarly.  Of course, the
algorithm doesn't work with diagonal movement, but I assume that most
people use the arrow keys -- maybe this could be implemented as a new
function called `GeometricDirection' or something similar.

Merry Christmas, everybody.

Is it possible to bind Alt-F4 in such way that if any window exists it
will be closed, but if no window exist pressing Alt-F4 will cause exit
from X (from startup script I have "exec fvwm2") ?

Regards, ( )

If you don't wany _any_ CDE you can just turn it off at boot time and
start X traditionally, with startx etc.

This is what I do on my Solaris boxes.

The algorithm calculating the 'best match' for the direction functions
takes the angle between the centers of the windows into account too.
Since the angle between the icon and the xterm is > 45 degrees, the
window is not considerered to be 'north' of the icon.  I agree that this
is not what one would expect.  If you like to write a better algorithm
(either as a patch for the latest CVS code or beta release or simply
in words) you are welcome to do so.  We haven't had much feedback on
this feature yet and would appreciate any cooperation to get a
more intuitive algorithm.

Really? I'll have to check the code why 'lenience' makes any difference.

If I choose to use the debug option, where do the debug messages get logged?
Can I use xconsole to this advantage (for debugging)?

Thank you in advance.

Hi!

Question:

Is it possible to set the title of a menu to a different
color as the rest of the entries in the menu?

Hi, the man page says that the output goes to stderr so to display it in X 
you could try this:
% startx &>./debug_log

then once X is started bring up a terminal and do a:
% tail -f debug_log

then turn on FvwmDebug and let the fun begin :-)
good luck,

Thanks for replying. I login via XDM and not through startx. In this case, where
do I pipe the log messages?

Can't you just redirect stderr from the command you use in your
.xsession or .Xclients file to start up fvwm2?

Something like:

exec fvwm2 > $HOME/.FVWM2-errors 2>&1

and then as suggested above tail -f .FVWM2-errors

or is this the wrong process?

Ok. This may be too basic. I have the following messages in my log file.

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FontPath' in ModulePath '/usr/libexec/fvw
m/2.2.4'
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module 'FontPath' in ModulePath '/usr/libexec/fvw
m/2.2.4'

Does this mean the "fonts" directory has to have a symbolic link in this directory?
The "FontPath" value is different from the one in the above message. In the "configure" script,
I have not seen the fontpath option. What is the significance of this message and how can I
fix this?

Thank you.

The simple answer is, find the line starting  with the word "FontPath"
in your .fvwm2rc and remove it.

Here's a more complete answer:

When fvwm  encounters a command that  it doesn't recogize,  it trys to
find a "module"  to execute with that   name.  When it doesn't find  a
module with that name, it issues the above message.

Its really trying to say that "FontPath" is not a valid command,
AND there is no module with that name.

It was a bug, plain and simple.  If you had two windows 'North' of
your focused one, one exactly 100 pixels above it and one 500 pixels
above it, the code prefered to select the window that was 500 pixels
away.  I.e. it selected the window that was farther away.  I've fixed
that in the development code.  The fix is quite simple:

In the DirectionFunc() function you'll find a line

  score = 1024 * offset / distance + 2 * distance + 2 * offset;

Simply replace the '/' with a '*':

  score = 1024 * offset * distance + 2 * distance + 2 * offset;

and it will work.  The patch I made takes care of an integer overflow
too, but in this case the windows have to be very far away (several
pages).

Ah, now I understand.  But if 'lenience' helped this would imply
that you could not set focus on the window with the mouse either.

Okay, I found the problem and fixed it.  The fix will be
available in the next beta release (2.3.12).

Because it's the default configuration for button 2.

My guess is that your fvwm version is too old.  The MWMDecorShade
style has been added with the alpha release 2.3.0.  It doesn't
work with 2.2.x.  Your configuration works perfectly with 2.3.11.

Sigh, RedHat again.  You can find an explanation of how to

The .XDefaults file ???? Um, but this is supposed to be used

I believe that RedHat 6.1 uses gdm as it's X login interface instead of
xdm.  For info on gdm look at /usr/doc/gdm-1.0.0/gdm-manual.txt .  Yep, it
appears that there is only a text man page... (at least on my system at
work)  From the gdm interface you can choose Anotherlevel as your window
manager.  (Don't ask me why they are calling Anotherlevel a window
manager...)  Any way, this will choose the version an fvwm2 installed on
your machine with fvwm95 decor by default.  It will process the
Anotherlevel m4 package with FvwmM4 and voila.  For modifying the
appearance or decors, see the AnotherLevel man page.

You should not have to modify the .Xdefaults file.

Hello

Does anybody know how to disable the Builtin Exit FVWM function?
The built in menu appears when you click mouse button #1 in an open
space (where a window does not exsist).  Any help is appreciated.

Thank you,

Mouse 1 R N -

but actually, the built-in menu is bound to all mouse buttons, so
if you really wanted to remove all mouse bindings for it:

Mouse 0 R N -

1) mailtool starting msg iconic
   Well, i can get around the iconic problem via FVWMEvent....it
   opens....but then sinks to the bottom. Raising it doesnt help. It just
   wants to be at the bottom.  Clicking the msg in the header window will
   then bring it to the top.

2) Using click-to-focus....i lose focus when mouse is over root window.
   Doesnt lose focus if i go to another window w/o crossing over root.

3) I wish there was a mouse-over-window (say, called "O"?) so i can use the

Is  this Sun's "mailtool"  in  /usr/openwin/bin?
If so, which Solaris release?   I've never  used it
before, but it seemed to default to starting iconic for me.
I couldn't reproduce the raise/lower symptoms.

You should tell us what focus commands you issued, but it sounds to
me like you need "SloppyFocus".

I use MouseFocus and the "Front" and "Open" keys all the time.

I'm not too familiar with Click-to-focus, but I just tried using it,
and my Front key binding seems to work.  Its bound like this:

Key F15   FSTWI0123456789 N RaiseLower

The "Open" key does seem to present a problem.

I'm guessing a lot of people use MouseFocus because they find the
mouse pointer gets in the way.  I find the "unclutter" program
the perfect cure for that.

> 4) Xview testedit windows dont have a label in pager.

Don't know.

> 5) What does afterstep support that fvwm2 doesnt?

If you find anything worth stealing, let us know. :)

No commands....just moved the mouse out of the window that had the focus.
Doesnt always do it tho.

SloppyFocus is a mouse-to-focus. click-to-focus shouldnt drop the focus w/o
a click elsewhere. I use click-to-focus because it allows hold-the-key-down
copies and moves (an xview thing). What is unclutter?

Key L5   FSTWI0123456789 N RaiseLower didnt touch the window the mouse was
over. It touched the one that had focus.

Thanx

Perhaps it asks fvwm to be at the bottom when it starts up.  If so
you should be able to raise it if you wait a second or two.

Does this happen with any application or just with certain windows?
My guess is that you have either some windows with MouseFocus or
the application reverts the focus back to the root window itself.

> 4) Xview testedit windows dont have a label in pager.

Does the window have a title?  Does it have a title when it's
iconified?  Probably the application doesn't set an icon title
and your pager is configured to show the icon label.  Try

  *FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat %r

or

  *FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat %t

Better ask the Afterstep folks :-) If there's something worthwhile,
just give us a hint so we can copy it.

unclutter is a program you run in the background  that makes the mouse
pointer disappear when  you haven't moved the  pointer for some amount
of time.  You should be  able to find it  at  ftp.x.org or thru a  web
search.  You seem to want to use click-to-focus for a different reason,
so I guess it wouldn't help you.

Yep, tried again, you're  right.

Debug output of an XDM session is usually automatically sent to a file
called $HOME/.xsession-errors.  Check and see if that file exists; it
should have any error messages from client startup and running clients
in the current session.  But if you log out of X and go back in, the log
will be lost.

I'm happy to announce that fvwm still runs despite the new
year.  Latest estimations for this unlikely case were
less than 5% ;-)  Furthermore, all other software to hack
fvwm still works (Linux, XEmacs, zsh, rxvt, X, mutt).

A happy new year to all fvwm users.

Dominik ^_^

Since 2.3.12 there is the 'PointerKey' command to do this.  Works
exactly like 'Key' except that it operates on the window under the
pointer.

Does this mean you have to restart fvwm to fix it?  Can you please download
2.3.12 and see if it still happens there?  There has been an awful lot of
changes since 2.2.x.

If you iconify the window, then de-iconify it, does it have
a label in the pager afterwards?

> Is FvwmPagerWindowLabelFormat new for 2.3?

Uh, yes, now that you mention it.
