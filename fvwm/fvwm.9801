I keep getting an error 'cannot allocate color table' or something of that nature ...
Is there anyway I could fix this?  I notice it seems to come up
ONLY when that EXACT color IS in use. say, netscape has 111 <BLUE> loaded
and I load up XV <XVIEW> .. The border doesn't load up in color, instead
it loads up in b&w ..  even thought it has 111 <BLUE> as it color..

Any help would be appreciated, for i ask on efnet in #linux, and I've been
working on it for 3 days STRAIGHT <seriously like 13 hrs a day> =]

Aaron

Is it possible to start modules in icon mode?
Simply putting -icon after the module name seems to be

Sounds like you're using  8-bit color, which  only allows you to use a
maximum of 256 colors at a time, and you've run out.

Start netscape with the "-install" flag and see if that helps.

I tried both -icon and -iconic options to FvwmButtons but it doesn't
work. Is FvwmButtons a special module maybe?

I have 2 questions

1. How do I get FvwmPagerMiniIcons to work with .fvwm2rc95?

2. How do I get 9 work areas in a desktop? I have 3 desktops
with 4 work areas in each. I am not able to create more work
areas.

Thanks in advance.

Near 2000, Brian Schroeder mumbled something about:

As far as I'm aware of, you cannot specifically target one of the buttonbars.
Perhaps there is some way to retrieve the process id of the currently focused window ?
Then, you could do an exec (kill ....).

Another thing might be to iconify the buttonbar of your choice and set style NoIcon.
It then disappears, but you can still de-iconify (thus retrieving) it.

Hope this helps,

I used to use a main button bar that could spawn secondary buttons bars when the
particular button was pressed.  To close the secondary button bar I had button
on that bar that executed a "Close".

For example I had a secondary button bar called "XtoolsBar" to close it once I
opened it I used the following line:

*XtoolsBar(Title close,Icon Yarw05rt.xpm,Action Close)

This always worked for me.

Hi,

I have been running Red Hat Linux 4.2 with Accelerated-X server and using
fvwm. It worked fine, but in the process of upgrading Linux to 5.0 and
reinstalling Accelerated X someting got screwed up and now when I am 
trying to start X windows session with fvwm the server crashes and I get 
the following error message:

fvwm: error in loading shared libraries
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6: undefined symbol _Xglobal_lock

Does anybody know what's going on?

Thanks.
Maya

Yes.  Short version: You can't do that.

Long version:  Red Hat Linux 5.0 is based on glibc-2.x ( = libc-6.x),
the GNU C library.  glibc is not compatible in several respects with
libc-5.x, which is the C library that shipped with Red Hat Linux 4.x.
Accelerated-X is very likely to have been built on a Linux distribution
that uses libc-5.x, not glibc, and it won't work on a glibc-based
system unless you provide the proper compatibility libraries.  You'll
need to check whether the proper libraries (and a mechanism for telling
applications to link with them instead of the default ones) are
available for Red Hat Linux 5.0.  Alternatively, you *might* be able to
find an Accelerated-X update that works on glibc-based systems; check
Xi's website about that.

This is one of those situations where a reading a lot of documentation
and thinking about things to make sure you don't break something is
useful.

In any event, questions about X servers really don't belong on the FVWM
mailing list---it's a little too far off-topic.

peace.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi everybody,

I am using fvwm2 and I really like it!

However, I have a slight problem with MiniIcons. What I would like is that the
main window of an application and all children get the same MiniIcon regardless
of the window name. E.g. gimp's main window is named 'THE GIMP' but a child
window containing and image might be called 'Unnamed something'. How do I
achieve that they get the same MiniIcon?

Many thanks for your time!

Regards,

        Andree

I've just installed fvwm2.0.46 on a DEC Alpha running DU4.0. So far
everything works fine except that I seem unable to get any styles for
the buttons in any titlebars for any windows. 

I've tried something as simple as

ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap mini.exit.xpm

as well as

ButtonStyle 1 4 50x65@1 35x35@1 65x35@1 50x65@0
ButtonStyle 4 4 50x65@1 35x35@1 65x35@1 50x65@0
ButtonStyle 2 13 26x29@1 34x21@1 50x35@1 70x21@1 79x29@1 63x48@0 79x65@1 70x75@0 50x61@0 34x75@0 26x65@0 44x48@1 26x29@0
ButtonStyle 3 5 40x40@1 60x40@1 60x60@0 40x60@0 40x40@1

I've used the sample system fvwmrc files as well as created my own but
nothing seems to work. Am I missing some piece of code or something? I
can use the pixmaps for the FvwmButtons without any problems, so I
know the program is finding the pixmaps. 

I do get four blank buttons at the top of each window and the mouse
buttons do what they are supposed to do for each of them. But I am
unable to get anything other than blank buttons.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Adrian

I'm no kind of expert on fvwm or buttons, but here's a fragment from
my rc file.  I took this from a sample fvwm2rc somewhere, I think, but
I had to change one or two things.  It may help - at least you can
plug it in and then tweak it.

I looked at the mailing list archive, and haven't seen a solution to the
problem of wandering FvwmWinList in Fvwm 2.0.46. Has somebody found a
solution for it ? 

Before being suggested to use FvwmIconMan, i'll describe my setup
quickly : I have two lists of my windows, one for the page and one for
the entire desktop. Some windows (of course) appear on the two lists,
but that doesn't bother me, since i have different actions bound on the
mouse buttons, for each of the lists. I'm using FvwmIcomMan for the page
list, and FvwmWinList for the list of all windows. I've tried to use two
FvwmIconMan, but 1)having twice the same window in two managers is
impossible, and 2) i haven't been able to configure the two managers,
there is always one which is empty. 

I have tried to have FvwmWinList swallowed by FvwmButtons, but then the
list is empty :-).

Does somebody have any clues ?

Thanks a lot

H.

Try adding the following line to your rc file:
*FvwmWinListGeometry  +0-1

Hope this helps,

Use FvwmIdent (or something) to find out more about the windows.
Maybe they share a common resource class?  Then, you might want to use
that in the Style command.

I have just installed fvwm2.0.46 on a DEC Alpha running DU4.0. Apart
from two niggling problems, everything seems to work fine (many thanks
to those who have worked on the code!). 

Problem 1:  I explained this in a previous message - basically I seem
to be unable to decorate the titlebar buttons. I can colour them, but
I cannot place triangles, X's, pixmaps or anything else in them. They
all work as per the definitions in the .fvwm2rc file, but they look a
bit boring! I've tried using several sample fvwm2rc files, but without
any joy. Am I missing a piece of software? I have XPM installed and it
finds the suitable icons for the FvwmButtons. I have run out of ideas
on this one.

Problem2: When I launch Emacs from the command line (as I used to do
when using the DEC CDE), everything works fine. If I launch Emacs
using FvwmButtons, then mostly everything works, except that for some
reason in this case Emacs can no longer find ispell! This is confusing
since ispell is placed along with all the other emacs code (such as
bbdb) and that is found without a problem. Does Fvwm do something
weird with paths? BTW, I am using Emacs 19.27. 

Apart from these two niggling problems (I have to remember to start
Emacs from the command line if I want to use email and I have to
remember what the blank titlebar buttons do) fvwm is wonderful - it
runs on my Linux box at home without a problem. Many thanks to all
those involved in keeping it going.

I glanced over the ButtonStyle definitions you included in your previous
mail and see nothing wrong with them.  I'll take the approach of an
earlier poster and show you what works for me:

ButtonStyle Reset
ButtonStyle 1 Vector 5 20x70@0 20x60@1 80x60@1 80x70@0 20x70@0
ButtonStyle 4 Default 6
ButtonStyle 5 Vector 4 20x30@0 80x30@1 50x80@0 20x30@1
ButtonStyle 6 Vector 9 20x40@0 20x30@1 80x30@1 80x40@0 52x40@0 52x65@0 \
                       48x65@0 48x40@1 20x40@0

These obviously won't be the button styles that you want, but you
might be able to use them as a starting point.

Fvwm inherits the environment (including paths) of whatever process
invokes it.  If you do a console login followed by 'startx' (or your
local equivalent), fvwm gets the same PATH info as your login shell.
If you use xdm, on the other hand, control gets passed to fvwm via
your .xsession file, so you'll want to set up your path info for fvwm
there.

Hope this was of some help to you.  Good luck!

Sorry for forwarding this guys, but after I forwarded it to all of these
lists, I did some reasearch and found the following note on the FCC page:

	http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/ispfact.html

	"Please Note: There is no open comment period in this proceeding.
	 If you have recently seen a message on the Internet stating that
	 in response to a request from local telephone companies, the FCC
	 is requesting comments to <isp@fcc.gov> by February 1998, be
	 aware that this information is inaccurate."

Turns out that the decision was already made NOT to do per-minute charges
back in Dec. 1996... Once again, sorry for the senseless forward.

Hello,

I enjoy having a virtual desktop page larger than my viewport;
however, occasionally I would like to lock the current viewport within
its position on the page (and lock the page in case the edge is within
mouse range)... perhaps assigning this function to a hot key (in much
the same way I occasionally use Num lock to lock the focus of a
window).

I've heard several people complain 'bout viewport scroll and edge page
jumping... both which have a solution; however, I feel locking the
viewport would resolve the source of these complaints in a on demand
fashion.

Has anyone attempted such a hack? Any chance of this function being
added in a future release?

Thanks,

Please cc me directly...

Well, doesn't the EdgeScroll command provide a way to turn the
scrolling off?  Just bind a key to to "EdgeScroll 0 0" and another key
to "EdgeScroll 100 100" or whatever your values are.

In case EdgeScroll isn't enough and you need EdgeResistance as well,
just define a two functions and bind the key to those.

I believe you've misunderstood the request. I'm not interested in just
locking the page, I'm interested in locking the viewport (i.e. the area
of the page currently being viewed).

Then this isn't a window manager issue; because the smooth scrolling
virtual size support comes from the X server.  You'll have to check its
documentation and see if it has a way to lock the scrolled region.

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
 Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
 Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
 Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

Subject: FVWM: Focus Hocus-Pocus
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello FVWM mailing list,

Recently I downloaded fvwm-2.0.46 and compiled it
for Linux/Alpha 2.0.32/X11R6.

This version (and possibly many previous versions I have not looked
at) has an annoying habit when destroying windows. It is moving the
focus when the window which is being destroyed DOES NOT have the
focus.

Here's what happens:

I have fvwm set up in click-to-focus mode.

My application creates windows, and changes the focus between windows
as needed. When the application is about to close one of its windows
(which currently has the focus), the focus is first pushed to the next
window which the application thinks should have it, then the original
window is closed.

In this way, the app is trying to keep the window manager from just
arbitrarily shifting the focus to some unknown window.

I looked in fvwm's code, and discovered this fragment in
HandleUnmapNotify() of events.c (There is a similar fragment in
Destroy() of misc.c)

  if((Tmp_win == Scr.Focus)&&(Tmp_win->flags & ClickToFocus))
    {
      if(Tmp_win->next)
	{
	  HandleHardFocus(Tmp_win->next);
	}
      else
	SetFocus(Scr.NoFocusWin,NULL,1);
    }

  if(Scr.Focus == Tmp_win)
    SetFocus(Scr.NoFocusWin,NULL,1);

Tmp_win is getting closed, and Scr.Focus is the last window that
fvwm gave focus to, but not necessarily the window with current
focus. When Tmp_win == Scr.Focus, BUT is NOT the window
with current focus, then fvwm resets the focus. This behavior
is annoying, since an application loses control over which window
has the focus whenever it closes a window.

It seems to me that fvwm should check to make sure that the window
being closed does indeed have the focus before trying to shift
it to another window.

Any insight would be appreciated,

-Todd Squires

There are two different things: some PC graphics cards provide a way
to have a desktop size that is greater than the physical screen
dimensions, and when the mouse reaches the edge of the screen, they do
scrolling (or "panning" as it is also called).  And the second thing
is that Fvwm provides for something similar.

Of course, how to enable or disable the hardware panning of the video
card with a keypress has nothing to do with fvwm.  I don't know how
this is done.  I hate it, so I configured my X server so that it is
turned off at all times.  For toggling this with a keypress, maybe you
should contact the people who created your X server?

I gave you information on enabling/disabling the equivalent fvwm
feature.  You can set the size of the virtual desktop with the
DesktopSize keyword and you can enable/disable the scrolling with
EdgeScroll.

Hi Kai, hi Michael

thanks a lot for your replies!

Unfortunately, gimp sets neither the class name nor the resource name, at least
this is what FvwmIdent says. But I presume they can be defined in gimp source
rather easily. I think I'l ask the the gimp people if they could do this.

Regards,

        Andree

Ever considered mapping a key to a function that sets EdgeScroll and EdgeResistance ?
I think it should do the trick. In this fashion, you could also define an inverse of this.

Hope this helps,

I assume that you're using XFree86 or MetroX or some similar thing on
an Intel box. You can turn off the hardware scrolling using the 'Virtual'
command in your X server config file (probably /etc/X11/XF86Config or
Xconfig or something like that).

If your actual resolution is 1600x1200 then say
    Virtual 1600 1200
and so on (make sure it is in the correct "Display" section).

Then use fvwm's scrolling as described by a previous poster.

                                              The USA goes to WAR January 31st!

                 WORLD'S TOP COMMANDOS CHALLENGE THE US MILITARY ELITE
                       Man to Man...Woman to Woman!...Hand to Hand! 
	
	January 31st will be a day to be hammered into the annals of history as a contingent of world military warriors converge on the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, North Carolina for the USA vs WORLD combat event. 

	A team of the USA's top military formerly active in the SEALs, Marines, Army and Air Force will defend their turf,  Hand to Hand, in eleven action packed bouts against a relentless assault from a crack  group of world commandos from Russia, the Middle East, Asia, Canada, Europe and Cuba.

	Specially developed fight rules designed for combat hardened veterans will ensure an intensity never before seen, throughout the eleven  fights.

 Each bout challenges fighters to three 1 1/2 minute rounds in a pentagon shaped ring.

	The world team is fully loaded with some of the most aggressive fighters on the globe and America has jumped at the challenge. 

 	Hundreds of applications have flooded the promoter's office. "Americans are patriotic, disciplined and determined to defeat the world team... this is going to be unbelievable!" says promoter Don Arnott. "I never expected this kind of response, everyone's in an uproar except the fighters, they just want to get down to it!"

	The event is available worldwide via satellite, providers expect unprecedented audience numbers due to the uniqueness of this event. Says one excited fight fan, "I seriously hope Americans know what their in for, this is a dream come true for some of the world team guys, it will be a night to remember!"

Development seems rather quiet on these two window managers.

fvwm95 is still at 2.0.43a (after a long time) and it would be nice if
a 2.0.43b were made with the pluggin version of FvwmTaskBar.

Alternatively, is FvwmTaskBar the only reason to use fvwm95 instead of
fvwm now that fvwm has mini-icons?  I'm not a big fan of FvwmWinList.
Uses too much screen real-estate for my tastes.  Can FvwmTaskBar work
in fvwm-2.0.46?  Or are people using TkGoodstuff-8.0a2 as an icon box?
  
  http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff/index-orig.html

(It's developement is stopped as well).  It looks good even if it
probably a few pixels higher than FvwmTaskBar.

Is fvwm still being worked on?

Just wondering...

Version 0.9.9 of FvwmIconMan is out. 

Changes since 0.9.8:
	Fixed bug where manager window wouldn't get
		properly cleared when it became empty.
	Changed function lookup to use bsearch
	Added 'label <string>' function, to provide named
		labels to jump to with bif, bifn and jmp.
	Altered get_current_man to always return the manager
		if there is only one.

Major thanks to Adam Rice (wysiwyg@glympton.airtime.co.uk) for adding the
label function so that we don't have to compute those relative offsets like we
did when we were kids pecking in assembly code into our primitive boxes.

As always, the you can get this from:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/software/
	or
ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/people/bradym/FvwmIconMan/

For those who haven't been keeping up, here are the changes between 0.9 (the
version with fvwm 2.0.45) and 0.9.8:


4/19/97		Version 0.9.8:
			Changed hash table size to 257.
			Fixed bug where followfocus was ignored.
			Hopefully fixed bug where some buttons wouldn't get
				drawn when window shape changed.
			MiniIcons should work on mono displays.
			
3/9/97		Version 0.9.7a:
			maximum width changed from 1000 to screen width.

2/11/97		Version 0.9.7:
			When FvwmIconMan was started without a managergeometry
			string, it would have an "Internal Error."
			Added titlebutton option.
			Added raisededge and sunkedge button styles.
			Manager no longer unmaps when empty, drawing the
				titlebutton instead.
			Added builtin function "warp"

2/10/97		Version 0.9.6:
			Added call to XSync() after setting window shape,
				otherwise, will get blank regions on next
				redraw.

2/7/97		Version 0.9.5:
			Fixed bug which caused buttons to change size
				when switching pages under high load.

2/6/97		Version 0.9.4:
			Added new action functions: bif, bifn, jmp, ret, print
				so now you can have simple if statements
			Fixed bug which caused manager to appear in surprising
				places when moving from one page to another.

2/5/97		Version 0.9.3
			Fixed bug where if a window moves from one manager
				to another (which can happen while FvwmIconMan
				is receiving the window list from fvwm), it 
				can end up using the format string of the 
				wrong manager.
			Fixed bug where if a window's name changes and
				that causes it to be removed from manager,
				it core dumps.
			Fixed bug which could cause FvwmIconMan to deadlock.
			Fixed window gravity bug which would cause corrupted
				window contents for managers which grow upward
				or leftward.
			other minor bugs.

2/4/97		Version 0.9.2:
			Silly me, I forgot that realloc (NULL, ...) isn't
				portable.

2/3/97		Version 0.9.1:
			rewrote almost all of the X code.
			can have multiple columns now.
			use shape extension if configured to.
			added shape option.
			added ButtonGeometry option.
			renamed Geometry option to ManGeometry, which works
				in units of buttons, not pixels.
			junked the old actions and redid all that.

One reason is if you want to emulate the TaskBar module using FvwmAuto
as suggested in a previous mail. This wont work on FvwmPager unless
you can get auto-raise to work.

Is there a simple way to disable the mini-icons completely in the
fvwm2 taskbar? I'm using fvwm2 with the Fvwm95 style. I don't want to
eliminate all mini icons completely (I like them in the menus) but
they take up valuable real estate when I have a lot of windows open.
I am using Red Hat 5.0, and all of the task bar buttons have that
mini-redhat.xpm icon. Very annoying! For the time being I've just
changed the name of mini-redhat.xpm to something different but I'd like
to know they right way to do it.

Thanks,

Leigh Orf

Yes, of course... this question was misdirected to fvwm. My
apologies. I've even seen this occasionally when switching between
window managers. Hopefully this feature can be added as one of XF86
Ctrl-Alt hotkeys.

Thanks to all who replied (although I was already aware of documented
EdgeScroll, EdgeResistance, and XF86Config's Virtual).

If you want a win95-style taskbar, and don't need the other things
that fvwm95 gives you (whatever they may be; I don't ever use fvwm95),
then you have several choices:

 - The fvwm95 taskbar has been re-ported into the main fvwm2
   distribution , although for the moment it's in the extras/
   subdirectory. It compiles fine on the three platforms I have access
   to (linux/intel, linux/sparc, and HPUX/PA-RISC). I'm not sure that
   anyone is maintaining it, but it works when I try it.

 - You can, as you mention, use tkgoodstuff. The author has stopped
   maintaining it and produced a "final" version; I think it's been
   stated that he's willing to pass it off to someone who wants to/has
   demonstrated ability to maintain it.

 - You can roll your own, which is what I did (actually, I modified
   some sample settings) and achieve a task-bar with FvwmButtons and
   FvwmIconMan. Your mileage may vary; I prefer my setup to the "true"
   win95 taskbar, but it's pure opinion. 

If you decide on the last approach, make sure that you're using the
latest fvwm2 code, as some things don't work well under earlier
releases. 

Below is my setup, excerpted from my .fvwm2rc. The config has two
problems:

  - It's not quite wide enough; the taskbar leaves a gap of several
    pixels on the left of the screen.
  
  - mini-icons disappear in the titlebar for apps that aren't
    minimized.

Hi!

	I'm using FVWM v 2.0.46, and I want transient windows to have only
title and border, no resize handles, no menu, no minimize and no
maximize buttons.

	How can I do this by configuration file, and how can I remove
decorations using XmNmwmDecorations or similar in my program.

	Thanks!

Hmm, the version that came with fvwm 2.0.46 claims to be version 1.0!
But maybe the numbering is not 100% consistent?

26:~>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2/FvwmIconMan --version
*FvwmIconMan: cannot open /dev/console
*FvwmIconMan Version 1.0 should only be executed by fvwm!

(I got it with RedHat 5.0, in case it matters)

Best regards,

Jakob.

Hmmm. This message is very old. If you look at the headers (which I can't
figure out how to get gnus to include in my reply, so you'll just have to look 
yourself if curious), it seems somebody's sendmail is confused.

I tried this but I get the errors:

Is 'Current' something new in 2.0.46?  I'm running 2.0.45.

On my Alpha WS, FvwmButtons or (Fvwm)GoodStuff doesn't appear on the
screen. I compiled with Digital and Gnu cc. I tried fvwm v1.24r 
v2.43, v2.46:same result. The SAME fvwmrc file runs nice on various
platforms (HPUX 9, Solaris 2.5, linux 2.0.30 ...)
There are no error message.

Does somebody have an idea ? 

Thanks a lot.

I would like to know whether there is any variable in fvwm that can be
set so that it gives sane color combinations (B/W) for a B/W
display. Else if there is any .fvwmrc tailored for B/W out there,
please let me know.

Hello,

I have a few applications with the same name swallowed by the FvwmButtons
module.

Is there any way to control which application comes where on the buttonbar ?

Thanks in advance.

Have you attempted to give  the appications different names thru -name
or -title on the command line?

Look  at the   applications using FvwmIdent.    Fvwm (and FvwmButtons)
"know" windows thru either the "Name", "Class", or "Resource" field.

if (hostname == foobar) then
   do_this

This is  another thing I  don't do,   but  try "man FvwmM4"  and  "man
FvwmCpp".

You might  find it simpler  to write  a shell called "do_this_or_that"
and  have the  shell  figure out  whether you  want   to "do_this"  or
"do_that".

FvwmM4 definitely allows you to do this, and I assume FvwmCpp does
too.  Here's a very simple example (note I use {} as m4 quote chars):

addtoMenu testmenu "Fvwm FVWM_VERSION" Title
ifelse({host1},HOSTNAME,{
+ "This is host1" Nop
},{host2},HOSTNAME,{
+ "This is host2" Nop
},{
+ "This is some other host" Nop
}

FvwmM4 defines the HOSTNAME and several other things.  I believe the
man page states all of them, though you might want to check the source
to be certain.

To use FvwmM4, I start fvwm2 with:

fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } .fvwm2rc" >/tmp/fvwm-errors 2>&1

Hi, folks.

I have a problem unbinding mouse keys from fvwm which looks to be a
bug to me, but I wanted to know if I'm missing something.  First a
little context, then the relevent fvwm2rc bits, then the bug
description.  I'm running fvwm-2.0.46 on Solaris 5.5.1 on a Sparc
Ultra-1.  The X server is Openwindows-3.0.

I bind modified mouse presses (e.g. ctrl-button-1) to fvwm functions
(iconify, raise, lower) in application window contexts.  Bunches of
these "newfangled" programs want to use these events for themselves.
Rather than rewire my head and hands to use something else I want to
turn these mouse bindings on and off in fvwm.  The relevent exerpts
from my fvwm2rc are:


AddToFunc EnableMouseInWindow "I" Mouse 1 W S Raise
+	"I" Mouse 2 W S Beep
+	"I" Mouse 3 W S Lower
+	"I" Mouse 1 W C Iconify
+	"I" Mouse 2 W C Move
+	"I" Mouse 3 W C Resize

I include them on a menu, but you can bind them to function keys to
test this.  The bug is that if I create a window, iconify it using
control-button-1, uniconify it, and turn off the bindings, that window
does not get control-button events (or any other modified button
events).  A window started fresh when fvwm's modified mouse bindings are
off receives all button events.  (I used xev to test this.) 

The behavior I'd like is for windows to get the button events that
don't have bindings.  In any case I think all windows should recieve
the same events.

If this is a bug, I'd like to get it on the bug list.  I don't have
the time or fvwm coding experience to patch this easily.

Please cc me on replies, I'm not subscribed to the fvwm discussion
list.

If the window in question is a pop-up from another window, check out
"style" "decoratetransients".

Otherwise look for a "style" with "notitle".

For this  to be a  bug, fvwm2 would  have to be   in conflict with its
documentation.   I think  the relevant  part is  "recapture" from "man
fvwm2":

     Recapture
          Causes fvwm to recapture  all  of  its  windows.   This
          ensures  that the latest style parameters will be used.
          The recapture operation is visually disturbing.

Notice  that  "recapture" affects  "styles",  but  not  key and  mouse
bindings.

I think  keys and buttons are associated  with windows when the window
is originally  created in "add_window.c",  in the functions "GrabKeys"
and "GrabButtons".


Still, it seems like this might  be useful functionality for fvwm2, so
you never know, someone might  decide to tackle  this, now that you've
identified what you'd like to do...

I'm not worried that Recapture doesn't add the bindings.  In fact, if
the modified mouse keys are bound to fvwm functions and a window has
somehow escaped the bindings, Recapture puts them into effect.

What I'm concerned about is that executing

Bind Mouse 1 A C Iconify

and then 

Bind Mouse 1 A C -

prevents applications from getting control-button-1 events when I push
the button in the application's window.  On the other hand, a window
created after the command sequence does get those events.  The
documentation that's concerning me is:

Mouse Button Context Modifiers Function
      Defines a mouse binding, or removes the binding  if
      Function is '-'.

It seems to me that if the binding is removed the application should
see the events.  This isn't explicitly stated there, but it seems
intuitive to me, and the inconsistency between a window that has its
bindings removed and one that is created after they are removed
distresses me.

>I think  keys and buttons are associated  with windows when the window
>is originally  created in "add_window.c",  in the functions "GrabKeys"
>and "GrabButtons".

If I get time to code dive, I'll start there, thanks.

Yes, I know I said I didn't have time to patch this, but it
exasperated me to the point of fixing it.


The problem:

Mouse 1 A C Iconify

followed by a later 

Mouse 1 A C -

doesn't pass events like Mouse 1 C through to application windows,
although windows created with the second binding in effect do see such
events.  This seems inconsistent with removing the binding.

Why do I care:

I don't use titlebars, and I want to be able to turn off my iconify
binding (above) to use application features.

The cause:

Whenever a new window is created, the bindings list is used to set
passive grabs in the various application windows.  On the event, fvwm
scans the bindings list and executes the bound function.

However, when a binding is cancelled, the binding is only removed from
the list, the grabs are unaltered.   This means that keys/buttons
formerly bound (like the mouse button above) are still grabbed, but no
function is executed.  Unfortunately the application never sees the event.

Because the majority of people bind keys and buttons in titlebars and
root contexts and rarely change them, this hasn't been a problem for
them - the root window wouldn't act on the keypress if fvwm didn't.

The solution:

I added code to the part of remove_binding() that removes the binding
from the list.  The new code checks to see if the removed binding was
an application context or all context binding, and if so it removes
all the grabs on application windows and reinstates relevent ones
using GrabButtons or GrabKeys as appropriate after the binding list
has been changed.  (Note this is just removing and establishing Grabs,
nothing is redrawn.)

It's linear in the number of windows, but it's also easier than
parsing the whole bindings list to see which bindings would have to be in
effect, too.  I think these changes are infrequent enough, and there
are few enough windows that this brute force algorithm is sure to be
right, and not too expensive.

Let me know what you think.  Since I'm posting patches, I'm now
subscribed to the list.

The patch:

Hi,

I have the following lines in my .fvwm2rc file (version 2.0.46):

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "XFMail" Icon, NoIconTitle, Iconbox 0 0 10 10

The first instance of XFMail seems to work fine with this definition; but if I
exit XFMail and then restart it, it no longer works as expected (ie no icon
displayed).  To get it to work again, I have to launch FvwmTalk, type in the
style line for XFMail, and then type recapture.

What is the problem?

Don't know, I just tried this and it worked for me.

Note  that the order of  style commands is  important.  If you were to
issue another 'Style "*" NoIcon' later on,  it would override the more
specific 'Style "XFMail"'.    Perhaps you  have another Style   NoIcon
somewhere else in your configuration?

Nope.  No other Style line after the one for "XFMail".  I forgot to add the
"sticky" style.  Therefore, my entire style line for XFMail is:

Style "XFMail" Icon, NoIconTitle, Iconbox 0 0 10 10, sticky

Does this make a difference?

Nope, not a d*mn thing (well, it shouldn't...).

Are you sure the startup commands for the first and second time are also exactly the same ?

All else I can think of is run FvwmIdentify on both XFMail before and after restarting.
See if there are any differences, especially the names should be exactly the same.

It's quite silly that this doesn't work properly, so there's probably some
_very_ small, simple, almost undetectable thing wrong :-)

Also check   for style commands  being  issued  thru  "reads" or by  a
function.

Try making your style commands the last thing in your .fvwm2rc.

Hello,
I'm a systems administrator for a lab of Sun workstations. We have some older 
Sparc 10's, and are trying to run fvwm 2.0.46 on them. Unfortunately, some of 
these workstations are old 2-color systems (pure black and white no greyscale). 
On these machine fvwm dies with the error "cannot find bitmap gray3"

The systems are running X11R5 (sun OpenWindows), libxpm 4.3, Solaris 2.5.1.

Any help, patches etc. would be useful. I don't subscribe to this list, so a cc: 
of any suggestions would be immensely useful

I noted the followups, but no one asked whether the window parameters
(class, name) were the same for the two invocations of XFMail.  Are they?
If not, then you might get the two behaviors.  And you might have some
race-like condition from issuing some Style commands, invoking XFMail, and
then reissuing some Style commands, so that the first XFMail is invoked
with different Style flags than later ones.  The question of whether the
invocation is different for the two instances is also interesting.

I'm running FVWM at home under a Slackware 2.0.30 installation, but I'm =
unable to install FVWM on my work PC running Doslinux 41.  X is running, =
but Doslinux doesn't include a compiler (which is what I think the =
problem is?), so I can't get the FVWM package installed.
Is there a binary distribution available for FVWM that'll install into =
Doslinux without the need to compile, or could someone guide me through =
whatever's needed to get the basic FVWM package installed?  I know this =
may be a bit of a large undertaking, but I thought I'd ask since I've =
been unable to figure it out from the man pages, manuals and on-line =
guides.
Thanks in advance and happy holidays!

I'm working on a Sun SPARCstation 5 using fvwm2 2.0.43 with one
login/fvwm2rc and on an ULTRASparc 2 using 2.0.43 with a different login
and resource file.   On one login ( the first ) if I double click on
(say) file.dat, only the
"file" part is highlighted but on the second the whole "file.dat" is
selected.  I can't for the life of me work out which bit of the
installation is causing this difference.   I would like to have the
"file.dat" behavior on both.   Anyone point me in the right direction?

It's to do with how your terminal emulator is set up.  For XTerm, the 
charClass property controls this.  For example, I've got the following in my 
.Xdefaults file (which is read by "xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults" in .xinitrc:

#if 0
Make "/-~$" parts of words for double-clicking
#endif
XTerm*charClass:        47:48,45:48,126:48,36:48

Other terminal emulators may do it differently.  XTerm's is certainly 
documented in a file in the source tree; I think it's in the manpage too.

Nothing to do with fvwm, anyway.

Yep,  that got it.    One login had

*XTerm*charClass:        33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48

in the ~/.Xresources.   I've added this to my other one and it's "done

Hi,

Thanks for all the help.  I found the problem.  There is a bug in tkgoodstuff
that sends to fvwm style commands even when you tell it not to.  I will have to
dive into that code to find the problem since it is no longer maintained.

Will the tkgoodstuff be maintained into the fvwm2 distribution?  It would be a
shame to loose this nice piece of code.

It appears from experiment and the code in ReadSubFunc() that long
lines in the FVWM configuration file can be split by ending the
partial lines with a backslash.  If this is supported behaviour, could
the man page please be updated.

Hi,

The following is the diff from the WindowList.tcl file that fixes the problem
with tkgoodstuff changing the styles in fvwm2:

149c149
<     if $FWL(nofvwmicons) {
---
>     if {$FWL(nofvwmicons) && $Fvwm(dostyle)} {

Sorry, but I have never produced a diff for a patch before.  I am sending to
this list since it is a fvwm2 interaction bug.  Since I loose all computer
access in March, I can not be a maintainer for this program (though it would be
fun!).  Will this be added to the fvwm2 distribution?

        Has anyone attempted to compile FVWM 2.0.26 with egcs 1.0.x or gcc
2.8.0?  Evidently Imake creates a combination of options to gcc which are
no longer compatible, namely -c and -o on the same line.  As I'm not very
familiar with Imake configuration (short of doing xmkmf -a) I'm not sure
where to go about fixing this.  Looking at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config, the
Imake.tmpl and Imake.rules are pretty cryptic to the uninitiated. ;)  If
someone could clue me in I'd be much obliged.  THanks,
                -Scott

   I am not sure why the different behaviors but I'd guess it has
   something to do with the particular X server on each box.

   But as a work around you could get the "file.dat.and.some.more"
   highlighted if you:

      first:   double cliek on 'file'
     second:   as you do the above keep the mouse button depressed
               and continue dragging over the rest of the file name.

   You'll notice that i'll highlight each 'chunk' of the file.name.part.

   Personally I like this behavior since it allows me to easily
   rename a file using copy/paste over an xterm.

   Hope this helps,

Patrick ...

I know in my version of fvwm2.0.46 you can issue SkipMapping as a style
command although I don't remember if this is a regular option or one that
I got from a patch called StartsOnPage.

You can find a link to the patch from the fv web site, if you can't let me
know and I'll look it up for you

This isn't really an FVWM issue.  Find the xterm man page and look for
the `charClass' resource, as well as the `CHARACTER CLASSES' section.

I've not tried this combination - and I assume you mean 2.0.46 - but, are 
you sure the problem is the configuration of fvwm and not the 
default rules for the version of make that you use?  GNU make in 
particular checks for this when building its default rules at 
configuration time.

        The SkipMapping style has been a standard feature for a long time.
However, as Brad suggests, you might want to have a look at the StartsOnPage
patch, which does what StartsOnDesk does and more.

        I did mean 2.0.46 :)  I'm pretty sure the problem is in Imake and
not fvwm.  If thats what you mean about the default rules of make there-in
lies my problem. I haven't been able to find any clear documentation on
Imake so I'm not sure how to go about changing the rules without messing
things up worse than they are.

Yes, I tried compile as you discribed and got the same results.
Don't know why or how to fix it either...

I confess I haven't looked, but I find it really hard to believe that gcc now 
can't accept -c and -o on the same line.  Isn't it something else that's going 
wrong?

        Well believe it.  Here's a snip from just one object compile.  It
will do this for everything.

This still seems unlikely.  I mean, configure --srcdir pretty much requires -c 
and -o!

Hmm, the isolated LinuxMachineDefines looks dodgy.  I suspect that.

I had the same problem with LinuxMachineDefines and egcs 1.0 about a
month ago or so.  The spec files of the new gccs are different, and
somehow break the Imake preprocessing.  I forgot how I worked around
it, I probably just reinstalled 2.7.2.3 for the meantime.

I just had a quick look.  It seems that when /lib/cpp is called by
itself, it does not get the options listed in the *cpp: section of the
spec file (maybe this is intended).  It receives those options when
called from the gcc driver though.

As a *workaround*, I put the following script as /lib/cpp2:

#! /bin/sh
gcc -E "$@"

Then, in my shell, exported IMAKECPP:

IMAKECPP=/lib/cpp2; export IMAKECPP

Then you should be able to use xmkmf as usual.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

When changing icon pixmap from within a program, fvwm2 destroys the current
icon window and creates a new one with the new pixmap, even if it has the
same size. This causes:

a) an annoying flash as the icon is removed/recreated
b) a possible jump to a different location on the screen
c) the new icon window is placed on top of any window that was previously
   over it.

The patch below (applies on 2.0.46) cures this.

Cheers,

	Mattias Engdegrd.

Hi there.

I currently have an Fvwmbutton performing different actions when I
left click it or right click it.

I'd like to have the button use different icons on both occasions as well.
Is that possible ?

I mean something like:
left mouse performs action A and sets icon to a.xpm
right mouse performs action B and sets icon to b.xpm

Thanks in advance,

CIAO di Alphons van Werven.

I _still_ don't believe it, and now I can see your problem (first rule

Yes, "multiple compilations".  I certainly believe that.

Allow me to remove the extraneous -I and -D options from your compile
line, and it should be obvious what the problem is:

  sl> gcc -Wall -O2 LinuxMachineDefines -c FvwmButtons.c -o FvwmButtons.o

DOH!  You appear to be trying to compile two files (LinuxMachineDefines
and FvwmButtons.c) into one object file (FvwmButtons.o).  Not gonna
happen!

PS. Can't FVWM use config.h or something instead of providing all those
    -D options on the compile line?  It's most annoying to read :)

The "multiple compilations" is the clue - on line 2 of the gcc command
there is "LinuxMachineDefines" - I expect xmkmf has not made the
substitution for this symbol because there is a syntax error in the
Imakefile or a *.tmpl file.

        Well you guys hit it on the head for me.  Thanks!  I didn't see
the LinuxMachineDefine entry in there.  Guess I shouldn't work on this
stuff at the crack of dawn. :)  In any case, it would appear the cpp
in egcs, pgcc and gcc 2.8.0 is processing the linux.cf differently than
gcc 2.7.2.x and for some reason it never hits the line:

#define LinuxMachineDefine -D__i386__

I found if I moved this line to immediately after the LinuxSourceDefines
in linux.cf it works great.  Thanks again for all the help. It was driving
me nuts. :)
                -Scott

    I am Shengliang Song.  I bought NEC READY9522R computer on June 6 in 1996.
    Last month, I added zip drive (parallet port) and an new Western Digital
    hard drive (5.1 gigabyte).  And then, I install linux system (Redhat 5.0)
    into my computer.  Now, before my computer begins booting, it display 
    the following:
        . . . 
     	3F8H com address conflict 
	Fixed Disk 0: Identified
	
	<F1> to resume, <F2> to stetup

     I did not know why?  ( Is there something wrong my new hard drive or 
     Redhat 5.0 or zip drive?  Or is there something wrong my computer?)
     After pressing F1, I can boot win 95 or UINX (Redhat 5.0).  They all
     work fine. My only problem is that "3F8H com address conflict".  What
     is that meaning?  How do I get that?  In addtion, when I boot with win95,
     I, sometimes, can not find my CD drive, but sometimes I can find it.

	  Second, when I boot with linux (Redhat 5.0), and I cannot start
	  X window because it does not have configuration file with
	  my Alliance ProMotion (version 4.1.19).
	  
	  Do I have to change a video card? 
	  How do I start X window with Alliance ProMotion?
     
     Sincerely,

     Shengliang Song

Actually, the cpp is not reading the (*cpp section when run by itself)
in the /usr/lib/gcc-lib/.../specs file.  There are other defines it is
also not getting, although you can make it work without modifiying the
Imake configuration, which is okay, with the workaround I posted
earlier.

Hi,

I am running fvwm2 on RedHat 5.0 with MetroX and I have
problem trying to disable the edge scrolling feature.

It appeared to me that .fvwm2rc in my home directory is
not used at all as changing the file has no impact at all.
I was able to reconfigure the window manager by copying
the following files from /etc/X11/AnotherLevel/ to my 
home directory and make changes to them:
  .fvwm2rc.defines
  .fvwm2rc.defstyles

However, I have not been able to disable edge scroll.  When 
the mouse pointer goes to the edge of a page, it just goes
right to the next page without any hesitation.  After each
restart of X, the edge scroll feature is disabled but 
the edge scroll is enabled by itself after a couple of minutes
of use.

I have been playing around with with the numbers from zero to
very large numbers in the following lines without any success:
  define(`EDGE_SCROLL_RESISTANCE',400)
  define(`EDGE_MOVE_RESISTANCE',40)

Does anyone know how I can get around the problem ?
Thank you very much for your help.

Regards,
Wayne Ling

If you mean the smooth scrolling that happens because you have the X server
configured to use a larger virtual size than display size, then you won't
be able to turn it off from FVWM because it has nothing to do with FVWM.
read the documentation for your X server and figure out how to turn it off
there.

No, I do not mean scrolling on a virtual desktop which area is
larger than the display area.  I mean that the desktop is has
several virtual pages and I do not want to go to another page
when the mouse pointer reaches the edge of a page.  I have done
my reading already.  The disabling of edge scroll can be done with
.fwm2rc but my win manager does not appear to take the cue from
the .fvwm2rc file at all.

That is quite strange. Just my suggestion, try play with your .fvwm2rc
file and change other settings to see if they have any effect at all. If
not, try running fvwm by "fvwm -f ~/.fvwm2rc". "Edgescroll 0 0" in
.fvwm2rc shold fix the problem. If still not, maybe you need to recompile
your fvwm...

I copied  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/Xclients to ~/.Xclients and
changed the following line
    FVWMOPTIONS="-cmd 'FvwmM4 -debug $RCFILE'"
to
    FVWMOPTIONS="-f ~/.fvwm2rc'"

Now .fvwm2rc has effect. but with "Edgescroll 0 0", I still see
the scroll over to the next page.

I use slackware instead of redhat so that I don't have the file Xclients
in effect. But I suppose the variable FVWMOPTIONS is just the options
being passed to fvwm when it is called. I still don't understand why your 
fvwm does not know to use your .fvwm2rc file when not using this option.
It should be the default resource file. But that is a little off the
thread.
 
As for the problem of scrolling, I suspect you may have redefined 
EdgeScroll somewhere else in your .fvwm2rc file, try look for it. If not,
try using "EdgeResistance 10000 0", see if it helps. 

Best wishes,
G.Xu

Hi,

My name is Chuck. I was using fvwm95 on my pc. I got it with Linux 2.0
(SLAKWARE) and XFree86.  I installed a new video card (Millenium II) to
support a large screen monitor I got.  I purchased AcceleratedX from
Xigraphics to get support for my video card. 

I now realize I don't understand fvwm.  Does fvwm run on top of an Xserver
like AcceleratedX or in place of it?  If it runs on top what would I have to
do to make it run (when i type in fvwm95-2 at the command line I get a can't
find screen message)?

If you coulld help me understand this I would appreciate it.  The web sites
I've been to haven't helped me figure out how fvwm fits into the overall
system picture.

Thanks,
Chuck

Hi there Chuck,

Sometime in the late 1900s it was said:

   This is not related but I thought XFree86 3.3.1 had support for
   the Maxtor Millennium II graphics card.  Am I wrong?

   I am not familiar with AcceleratedX .. but yes fvwm or any other
   window manager (wm) needs to run on top of a Xserver.  So the
   process is to start up your X server and then start your favorate
   wm.

   This can be done in a few different ways.  The way I am doing this
   is I start my X server using the 'startx' script.  I also have a
   '.xinitrc' file in my home directory which at the very last line
   has the command to startup my wm (fvwm2 for the time being).  The
   '.xinitrc' script is executed as the server is brought up and as
   a result of the last line the wm (fvwm2) is started.

   btw ... fvwm95-2 is not the same as fvwm2.  It is a derivitive of
   fvwm2 as far as I know.

   Hope this helps .. I am sure there will be others from this list
   that will be able to help answer your questions to more detail.

I think you mean Matrox not Maxtor.

And yes, you are correct, the Matrox Millenium 1 and 2 are supported
by recent XFree86 SVGA servers.

Yes, fvwm (like any other window manager) runs on top of the so-called
X server.  There is a clear division of labor: the X server can
display stuff on screen, and the window manager tells the X server
what to display (in addition to the application windows already on
screen), such as borders, title bars, mouse cursors.  When you hit a
mouse button to move a window, the window manager intercepts it and
tells the X server where to move the window.

Whether or not fvwm works should not depend on your X server.

The same old startup code that worked for the old video card should
work for the new one, except of course that you have to run a
different X server.  I think there is a file in /etc/X11 that tells
the system what binary to use as X server, just enter Xaccel there.

Maybe I should clarify my question:

I would like to change the icon on a button during an Fvwm session.

Any t(h)oughts on how to accomplish that ?

fvwm runs on top of AcceleratedX. Basically, this is how things work...

You turn on your computer and it boots Linux at some point. I'm not sure
if you have your system setup to start the X windowing system on boot, or
if you start it from a console, so I'll explain both.

If your system boots into X11 automatically, what happens is that the
computer boots, does everything that is necessary, and eventually runs
xdm on your computer so that it corresponds to screen :0 (the first
screen). Xdm stands for the X Display Manager. It starts an Xserver
session and listens for all kinds of requests (most too complicated for me
to go into). It also pops up a login screen for users to log in. When a
user logs in, the owner of the screen is changed to the user which just
logged in, and the user is given control over what happens to the display.

Xdm runs a script called /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession which handles most of
that crap. The Xsession file simply does some housekeeping for the user
which cleans up any mess which is left behind. After all of that, Xsession
calls an executable in the users home directory called .xsession (usually
a script). This file has the job of actually running all of the stuff that
the user sees.

The .xsession file basically sets up any aditional environments (like a
PATH which includes personal X11 binaries, etc), maybe runs an xterm,
starts some backround processes that the user only wants to run when he
starts X, and the runs the window manager. 

That's what fvwm is: a window manager. It manages windows. It talks to the
Xserver and tells it how to move the windows around, draw borders around
the windows, minimize, etc. Otherwise, you'd have to use several hellified
commands to find out a window's XID and move it around with pixel
coordinates.

When the .xsession is run, the $DISPLAY environment is already set, so
fvwm knows which display to use.

Now... if start X11 from the console by running "startx" at the prompt,
the the same thing basically happens except that the filenames are Xinitrc
and .xinitrc respectively. Otherwise, the same basic ideas takes place
(except that the Xserver is run directly without worrying about the xdm). 
Xdm isn't needed because you already own the process and you are already
logged in. 

So to answer your question, fvwm is simply a program which manages the way
your windows are handled. The Xserver actually handles the hardware and
allows for programs (like fvwm) to map things to the display. Therefore,
fvwm DOES sit on top of the Xserver... it has to :)

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

This bug was reported by Douglas F. Elznic <delznic@acm.org> to the
redhat-list.  See also the reply by Eze Ogwuma <typhoon@dircon.co.uk>.
My report has more details.

[I'm running Red Hat 5.0, but I had a previously unexplained
phenomenon under RH4.2 for which this could account.  I'm running
fvwm2 (2.0.46), the default window manager.  I don't know how to tell
the version of FvwmButtons.  I have done little customization except
that I am running a newer X server (from SuSE, blessed by XFree86.org)
to support my video card.  I don't think that is relevant.]

When I shut down my X server using control-alt-backspace, FvwmButtons
does not terminate.  Worse, it burns all the CPU time that it can get.
When I first noticed this, I had a half dozen of the things splitting
the CPU between them.

Observations:
- C-A-BS shutdown leaves FvwmButtons burning cpu
- loging out doesn't stop it
- using strace on the FvwmButtons process after it has gotten into this
  state shows that *no* system calls are being made
- using strace on the FvwmButtons process from before C-A-BS results
  in FvwmButtons exiting properly!!!
- shutting down from the Start menu correctly terminates FvwmButtons

The fact that strace changes the result suggests that there is some
race condition involved.

When I examine the process using GDB, it seems to be endlessly
repeating the following sequence of instructions:

 0x40054ba4 <_XFlushInt+44>:	movl   0x4c4(%edi),%eax
 0x40054baa <_XFlushInt+50>:	testl  %eax,%eax
 0x40054bac <_XFlushInt+52>:    je     0x40054bbb <_XFlushInt+67>

 0x40054bbb <_XFlushInt+67>:	testb  $0x40,0x94(%edi)
 0x40054bc2 <_XFlushInt+74>:    jne    0x40054ba4 <_XFlushInt+44>

Every time it looks at the 32-bit quantity at 0x4c4(%edi), it seems to
find it zero.  Every time it checks the 0x40 bit in the byte at
0x94(%edi), it finds it on.  Nothing in this loop will change these
memory locations; I suspect that there is no longer an asynchronous
event to change them.

A "where" GDB command yields:
#0  0x40054bac in _XFlushInt ()
#1  0x40054b72 in _XFlush ()
#2  0x4005205e in XSync ()
#3  0x804989f in _start ()
#4  0xbfffefb4 in ?? ()
#5  0x40054b72 in _XFlush ()
#6  0x4005205e in XSync ()
#7  0x804989f in _start ()
#8  0xbffff13c in ?? ()
#9  0x4006ddbd in _X11TransWrite ()
#10 0x40054c34 in _XFlushInt ()
#11 0x40054b72 in _XFlush ()
#12 0x40054d08 in _XEventsQueued ()
#13 0x4004a5d0 in XPending ()
#14 0x804b725 in _start ()
#15 0x804a31f in _start ()
#16 0x804a2fb in _start ()

- Frame 0 is an invocation of _XFlushInt, apparently an internal-to-xlib
  function.
- It was called by _XFlush() which was called by XSync (XSync is a
  public xlib function).
- I don't know what Frame's 8 and 9 are about; perhaps signal handling
  is going on (that might mess up a stack frame)
- OOPS: _XFlushInt() and _XFlush() appear in 10 and 11.  Are they
  really meant to be re-entrant?

My *guess* is that something is being done in a signal handler that
isn't safe.  Note that almost nothing is safe in a signal handler
(according to the ANSI/ISO standard for C).

You have probably already seen that just issuing a new "style" command
to change the icon name is not sufficient.

I  think you  need something  like "recapture" but  you   only want to
recapture the one window.

I believe source code changes would be required.

Yes, there are a number of these signal handler problems in fvwm.  A
patch has been submitted (from Grant McDorman) and will appear in the
next version (2.0.47).  Search the mailing list archives if you want
it sooner.

FWIW, I don't think X will allow you to start without a mouse (or at least
XFree86 on Linux won't).

I finally stumbled to the right place.  When I press the left button,
there is a menu for "preferences" and I can disable edge scroll under

>From the XF86Config manpage:

In the ServerFlags section:

AllowMouseOpenFail
               This  allows  the  server  to start up even if the
               mouse device can't be opened/initialised.

By the way, I have had the same questions about making mouse hits and
drag'n'drop stuff.  I'd like to be able to do mouseless things too, and my
terminal setup _does not_ by default turn <return> into a mouse hit.  I'm
sure it's in the docs, but I apparently haven't adequately RTFM as yet.

G'day,

I was just compiling fvwm v2.0.46, which compiled fine on my machine
about 2 months ago, and I received some compiler errors which I've never
seen before.  I'm running Linux 2.0.33, with X11 v. 3.31 (I believe).
Anyways, without further ado, here are the errors:

FVWMSRCDIR is /home/mclare/backup/fvwm-2.0.46
Making top-level Makefile
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
Imakefile.c:13: Imake.tmpl: No such file or directory
imake: Exit code 33.
  Stop.
done
Making Makefile in libs
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
Imakefile.c:13: Imake.tmpl: No such file or directory
imake: Exit code 33.
  Stop.
<Tons of output trimmed>

This happened after doing a `MakeMakefiles`.  Looks like I'm missing
Imake.tmpl, or the Imakefile is broken, but it compiled fine previously.
Any help would be much appreciated.

	Thanks, sebu.

Anyone running a mouseless environment (no mouse, no trackball, no pen,
no nuthin')? 

I've got a user who wants to try it.  Fvwm can move the sprite well
enough but how do you define keys for Clicks and what about dragging? 

Any config hints apprecicated,

I finally stumbled to the right place.  When I press the left button,
there is a menu for "preferences" and I can disable edge scroll under
the "Scroll Setup" submenu.

Hi guys!

I love FVMW2, and I brag about it to everyone I meet.  EdgeResistance
is one of the bragging points -- how easy it is to line a window up
against the edge; but there is one feature of EdgeResistance which I
think could be improved.

I run:

  EdgeScroll 0 0
  EdgeResistance 0 100

I occasionally wish to move a window partially off the desktop, but
when I overcome the 100 pixel EdgeResistance, the window jumps those
100 pixels.  I would love it if the window simply started moving again
once the EdgeResistance was overcome.  That way I could drag it 125
pixels in order to place it 25 pixels off screen.  Can this be done?

Hi All, 
I want to get the current PageNumber and Desk number. Actually
I need this because I want to start application on the same page/desk
on which the focus was when I click button. Can I specify StartsOn
inside Exec so that I can get this effect.


Thanx in advance.

Several applications pop up windows (file browsers, ...) which
don't have a title bar and which I can not move using the mouse.
I guess these windows are called override or transient?
How can I configure fvwm2 to allways show a titlebar, so that I can
allways easily move these windows with my mouse on my screen.

Appreciate your help.

1) Try something like Style "*" Title, Borderwidth ...
2) Why would you need a frame for moving windows ?
Mouse 2 W A Move
makes that you can move a window by dragging with the middle mouse
button. You could of course choose another mouse button or
specify a key modifier, but the point is that you don't need a
frame around the window.

Hope this helps,

Also, look thru the man pages and read about "DecorateTransients".

[Concerning my desire to be able to use "EdgeScroll 0 0" and
 "EdgeResistance 0 100" but still be able to drag a window 25 pixels
 off screen, something that I can't do now since the window jumps 100
 pixels when the EdgeResistance is overcome.]

I just got a reply from someone who said that he too was interested in
such a feature, but when he looked at the code he determined that it
would be more of a pain to do than he expected.

One alternative to the window not jumping when the EdgeResistance is
overcome is to turn EdgeResistance into a one-way barrier -- to make
the window jump on the way out, but to allow the window the be
smoothly dragged back in.  Thus, to move a window 25 pixels off
screen, I would initially drag it 100 pixels off screen to overcome
the EdgeResistance, and then drag it back 75 pixels.  This seems
easier to implement and possible more intuitive to use.

What do you think?  I do run "EdgeScroll 0 0", so I don't understand
how this change to EdgeResistance would affect shifts in viewport.

I think I once used an olwm or olvwm where this was true.  I loved
it.  But I think it is more difficult to implement than the current
scheme.  Who knows?

I like this suggestion, and I would most likely use it to maximize the 
part of an image I want to read/view,  e.g. with xdvi, ghostview, acroread.

The ChangeLog for fvmw2 version 2.0.46 includes:

       37. Focus command no longer raises - use an interpreted
           focus-and-raise function if that's desired

My first attempt at such a function was this:

  # The Focus command no longer raises the window automatically.
  # Here is a function that emulates the old Focus behavior.
  DestroyFunc focus-and-raise
  AddToFunc   focus-and-raise
  +                           "I" Focus
  +                           "I" Raise
  
  # And here are the new bindings.
  Key Tab         A       M       Next [CurrentDesk] focus-and-raise
  Key Tab         A       MS      Prev [CurrentDesk] focus-and-raise

This function did focus and raise the next window, but then focus
immediately returned to the window under the mouse.  (This would
probably not have been the case with ClickToFocus -- I use
SloppyFocus.)

I then discovered that by defining the function like this:

  # The Focus command no longer raises the window automatically.
  # Here is a function that emulates the old Focus behavior.
  DestroyFunc focus-and-raise
  AddToFunc   focus-and-raise "I" Focus
  +                           "I" Raise

it worked as I expected -- the focus remained with the newly raised
window and did not return to the window under the mouse.  Also, this
second form results in a much faster function -- one which can keep up
with my keyboard repeat rate if I hold down Alt-Tab.  The first
function is considerably slower, with a visible delay between the time
that the next window is raised and it shifts color to indicate that it
has focus.  (This is easier to see when the mouse is moved to the root
window so that focus stays with the newly raised window.)

Is this a bug or a feature?  I initially chose this first style
because it is used in the Debian system.fvwm2rc.  I now see that the
fvwm2 man page only shows the second style for AddToFunc, but it does
not warn against the first style, and that style is used for
AddToDecor.

Hi there.

Fvwm always places my windows for me.
is there a way (I was thinking of a Style property) to realize
that I can manually place a window when it comes up ?

I couldn't find such a thing in the man pages.

Thanks in advance,

        Try

            Style  "*"  DumbPlacement, ActivePlacement

If you like to use both on occasion, you can create a couple of functions
in your fvwm2rc, like these that I use, so you can switch back and forth:

    AddToFunc  SetSmart
    +                    "I"  Style "*" SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
    +                    "I"  Recapture

    AddToFunc  SetDumb
    +                    "I"  Style "*" DumbPlacement, ActivePlacement
    +                    "I"  Recapture



        Cheers,
        Bob

I think I can  say, "I'm sorry I looked".   Well, its not  really that
bad...

Not only  is "AddToDecor" documented to  work like this, but there are
some   "AddToFunc"   examples      that   look    like   this       in
sample.fvwmrc/decor_examples.  (Ie.  the "action" is  missing from the
first definition line.)

A quick look at the code seemed to show that AddToFunc, AddToMenu, and
AddToDecor all seem to use the same parsing  logic, so they should all
follow the same syntax rules.

They all seem to ignore the fact that the "action" part of the command
is  missing from the first line,  and  store away  a  blank action for
later use.

In  the case of   AddToFunc,  the  function  later  gets  executed  in
complex.c:ComplexFunction().  This function expects the first token to
be "D" (DOUBLE_CLICK), "I" (IMMEDIATE),  or it assumes it's some other
valid value that turns on a flag that looks to  me like it will try to
defer execution  of the command.  Perhaps   that explains the reported
symptom.

I'd  vote for making "AddToFunc" without  an action valid syntax since
it seems to be  pretty natural.  If this isn't  fixed after  2.0.47, I
might be willing to give it a stab.

Hello to all

I've been experimenting with decors. I now have 3 very sightly
different styles. obviously I would like all the common stuff
to only be written once.

I tried to add to decor default but the other decors don't pick
this up and instead used some other (inexplicable) defaults.

does anyone know how to do this, or does the code need changing.

I'm using Fvwm Version 2.0.46

thanks
Graeme

looks the exact same thing I have fun with here at since redhat betas of
4.8, 4.8.1, 4.9 and 4.9.1 (possibly 4.2 but I don't remember it)

The funny thing is even Ctrl-Alt-BkSp from XDM will do the same thing
which i would have thought it would keep it working and kill it... gues
not...

I would have thought that the FvwmButtons is a child of the X process but
from my looking into the startx and all of those scripts it appears to be
part of xinitrc...

There is no facility for copying decors directly in fvwm2, and it
would really need code modification.  Maybe something along the lines
of (I think a copy would be more appropriate than something like
InheritDecor since changing the common decor later would not modify
any intended descendents, that would require major restructuring):

AddToDecor "MyNewDecor"
+ CopyDecor "CommonDecor"

I do something like this using FvwmM4:

## define a decor ... DECOR(name, dark_colour, light_colour, marble)

m4_define(DECOR, `AddToDecor $1
+ WindowFont WINDOWFONT
+ HilightColor Yellow $2

+ BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles
+ BorderStyle InActive (TiledPixmap MARBLES/$4 -- HiddenHandles)

+ TitleStyle RightJustified
+ TitleStyle Inactive   (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ TitleStyle ActiveUp   (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ TitleStyle ActiveDown (VGradient 32 Black $3 -- Flat)

+ ButtonStyle All Simple
+ ButtonStyle All InActive (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (VGradient 32 $3 Black -- Raised)
+ ButtonStyle All ActiveDown (Pixmap mini-exp.xpm -- Flat)

I haven't tested this, but wouldn't something like this work?

So I've been sitting here at my computer running RedHat 4.2/5.0 and
Fvwm2 and I've been thinking...

   "Geeze, why does my K6-233 machine seem to be the slowest machine
    in the office?"

This thought has been around for the past few weeks but since we are
always getting newer faster computers I figured that mine was just
becoming obsolete in a hurry.

Well today Things were horrible and so I did top to see if accidentally
had some program I wrote churning out zombies or other detached processes
from my thesis program.  And what I found was I had seven instances of
FvwmButtons running and they were all fighting for 100%CPU attention.

I read the mailing list archives and noticed that others are having
similar problems but I couldn't find a fix for it.

my fvwm version is 2.0.46, does anybody have an unofficial patch for this
problem or know where I can get one?

- Jeff

My feeble memory tells me that I once suffered from this, too, in long-ago
days (perhaps pre-version2), and that it was a (sometime later) fixed
problem with FvwmButtons not noticing that its pipes to its parent were
dead and gone.  The fix at the time was a few lines dealing with testing
the read pipe returns, exiting on closure of the pipes. I haven't noticed
it on my own office 2.0.46 setup, nor at home on the (2.0.43?) setup I'm
running.  I hope this helps someone, although I don't see how this
particular error could have crept back into the code.

I wrote the patch; the latest version is attached.

Other modules have the same problem; however, since they aren't used as much
the problem is not as visible.
