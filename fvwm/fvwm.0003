This doesn't sound like the classical multi head setup.  Usually
you tell X to have two 'screens' (usually :0.0 and :0.1).  In the
'multi screen' case fvwm is started on the first screen and then
spawns copies on all other screens of the same display.  The copies
of fvwm don't know of each other's windows.  If you start and
application from screen 1 it's windows should always appear on the
same screen.

This is on the wish-list, but not implemented yet.

No.

"multiple disjoint desktops" means that only one desktop is visible
at the same time.  To switch between desktops you use the GotoDesk
command (or the obsolete 'Desk' command).  The default desktop is '0'.
To switch to another desktop you can say 'GotoDesk 123987'.  The new
desktop will have no windows when you first make it visible (except
sticky windows).

:-) You'd better ask the netscape developers about this.  If
the window is not decorated because of the MWMDecor hint, then
netscape must have explicitly requested that the window is not
decorated.

Why don't you simply say

  Style Netscape GrabFocus, GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent

This should apply to all netscape windows (because they have
resource class 'Netscape').  All the your examples seem to work
for me.  BTW, are you invoking the find window via a key binding
or a mouse click?  Unfortunately GrabFocus... doesn't work with
the mouse together with SloppyFocus/MouseFocus.  The reason is, that
as soon as the menu is unmapped, the pointer enters the main window
again and takes the focus away from the newly mapped transient window :(
Can't think of a workaround for this.

Hi folks,

I'm on vacation for the next two weeks, and won't be able
to read or answer any postings most of the time.  I'll
be away from tomorrow evening (Thursday) to the 16th of
March.  Perhaps I'll be back a few days earlier.  Happy
bug fixing.

Hmmm... there must be a way to make GrabFocusTransient work with
SloppyFocus. I think it might even have been working with one of the
earlier snapshots before 2.3.13 or so since I recall that at one time it
seemed to be working.

Also, FvwmFormGrabServer works with SploppyFocus so there must be a way
to make GrabFocus work with SloppyFocus. GrabFocus also works with
SloppyFocus, even when the mouse pointer is inside a window and a
new window gets mapped.

Best Regards,

Neil

Horror at the Grocery Store

It was one of those days when nothing was going right.  As dinner
time approached, I found that I was out of milk and kitty food,
so I grabbed the kidlet and ran to the store. The store was full
of people stopping for the milk or bread on their way home from
work, and even the express lane had 15 people in line.  With the
milk jug in my hand, and my two and a half year old on my hip
holding the box of kitten food, I waited my turn...

FROM OUR BULLETIN BOARDS

High Turnover Rate!!!

As Assistant Director of a large center I am responsible for
hiring our staff and it is driving me crazy!!! We pay so little
good teachers are impossible to find, they can't afford  to work
for us. So we end up with aides with no education who actually
"forget" to come to work! This is my biggest headache. I
advertise at our local colleges but most of the students know
they can get better paying jobs with degrees. Does anyone have
any ideas?

Do you have the answer? Good advice? Click here to reply:

NEWS AND TIPS

o Overcoming Shyness with Creativity

While most young children possess a wonderful lack of inhibition
and eagerness to try new experiences, some lack social confidence
and find unfamiliar people and places frightening. By fostering
and encouraging creative skills, you can help build your child's
confidence...
(More: http://www.edaycare.com)

o Program Trains Substitutes for Day-Care Teachers

...Through the GTCC Substitute Program, adults will learn how to
teach and care for children in day-care facilities. In turn,
their education will allow other day-care workers to leave their
post to further their own education, thus providing a higher
quality learning environment for the children they care for
each day...
(More: http://www.edaycare.com)

o Having Kids Can Pay Off at Tax Time

Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone
is writing a book. -- Cicero

Not much has changed in 2,000 years. Kids still don't listen, and
when they grow up, they write first-person essays for The New
Yorker about your Vienna sausage casserole...But one aspect of
child rearing has changed: the cost. The average family can expect
to spend $156,690 by the time a child reaches 17, according to
the Department of Agriculture.  That's just for food, health care
and sneakers. Toss in college tuition, and you're looking at
another $50,000 to $80,000 before you can turn junior's bedroom
into a yoga studio...

I just installed fvwm, apparently successfully.  I installed it while in
gnome, on RedHat Linux 6.1 running on a 450 MHz Pentium III computer.
After installing fvwm, I quit X windows, and typed startx again.  I got
gnome again, so I quit it and this time I typed fvwm.  But it complained
that it can't open the display.  I tried various other things, but I
haven't been able to get it to work.

What should I do?

Thanks in advance.

  what's going on:

  X window system: a server that can display graphics (primitives like
windows, lines etc.), it does not care about desktop (window
borders/icons/menus etc...)

  widget libraries: buttons, menus, icons, scroll bars and other parts
of user interface

  window manager: program that manages windows (provides borders, means
for user to move/resize windows, ...)

  desktop environment: higher level, usually provides combination of:
basic programs, widgets with common look/feel, window manager etc...

  gnome is desktop environment, it can use one or another window manager

  fvwm is window manger. it requires X server running.

  check the gnome docs on how to change window manager.

  to try if fvwm is working:

  from virtual console type:

setenv DISPLAY :0.0 # csh, tcsh, ...
export DISPLAY=:0.0 # sh, ksh, bash, ...

X&

  this runs an X server (plain)

  switch back to virtual console and run

fvwm&

  and you should get the fvwm running (switch back to X server window to
see it)... try to click in the root window, you should get some menu.

  depending on how your X is set you might have to be root to run X,
although it might run Xwrapper by default...

Hello all !

I am using fvwm-2.2.4 and SloppyFocus mouse policy.
I tried to solve problem with transient windows generated by Netscape
and other apps. 
My solution is to bound function to map event:

AddToFunc WarpToTransient I Current (!Transient)
Next (CurrentDesk CurrentPage CirculateHit Transient) WarpToWindow 50 50

*FvwmEvent map WarpToTransient

Of course it's not quite correct if we activate another app while transient
window is on the screen. But if we use popup just after mapping and close it
it works good.

Regards

Vitit

Try creating a ~/.Xclients file to start various clients when xinit
is run.

Something like this should work:

  #!/bin/sh
  rxvt &
  panel &
  gmc &
  fvwm2

or better, the following which starts fvwm2 first, but waits for it to exit:

  #!/bin/sh
  fvwm2 & WMPID=$!
  rxvt &
  panel &
  gmc &
  wait ${WMPID}

The script probably need to be executable (chmod 755 .Xclients).
Then run startx.

If this doesn't work get back to me and we'll figure something out.

Cheers

If you have a standard RH6.1 set up, and you want to try Red Hat's standard
fvwm setup (called AnotherLevel) then you simply:

	startx (takes you into gnome/enlightenment)
	run switchdesk somewhere (e.g. a terminal window)
		- choose AnotherLevel
	exit gnome/enlightenment

	startx

and you should be in fvwm with the AnotherLevel package.

If you'd like to try a more configurable, flexible and prettier version of
AnotherLevel, called AnotherLevelUp, see

	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU

If you want to use the default fvwm setup (i.e. not Red Hat's set up), you'll
need to modify your standard dotfiles. No doubt someone else here has recently
done that and can give exact directions.

  Which of the multitude of fore/back/hi/etc/Color settings sets the
background colour of icons' labels when active/inactive?

  In fiddling around I inadvertantly made the b/g different for when the
icon's the [in]active window, but now I've got my config. back to normal &
I *want* to change this, nothing I try works!

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I'm using fvwm-2.2.4.

I have SloppyFocus set by default, and an FvwmIconMan running which is 
marked ClickToFocus.
I have GlobalOpts MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise
set.
In the icon manager, button1 is bound thus:
*FvwmIconMan*Action Mouse 1 N sendcommand "Iconify -1", 
    sendcommand Raise, sendcommand Focus

The thing that infuriates me is that whenever I click in the icon
manager to raise a window, the icon manager window itself raises as
well. 

I haven't yet managed to track down why this happens. Anybody
know it off the top of their head?

	Try adding 

GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntRaise

and see if that doesn't help. 

	Note that in the recent betas, all those GlobalOpts have been replaced
by corollary Style options, so that in future you'll be able to specify
this behavior for only FvwmIconMan, if you like.

Eterm has a nice -x option, which causes it to have no borders, title or any
other 'beautification' from the window manager. This option worked OK up until
2.3.13 (which is the second to last of the devels I have compiled). I just
compiled 2.3.16 and the option ceased to work.

Also I tried using "Style <mytitle> NoHandles" shich did not work...
"Style <mytitle> NoTitle" left the border intact, even though it removed the
title (as it should)...


ANy suggestions?

Hmm, could you use FvwmIdent or xwininfo to determine if the window is
set Transient or Override Redirect when eterm runs with -x? I figure
that's likely to be the reason it can hint the window manager that it
doesn't want decorations.

>Also I tried using "Style <mytitle> NoHandles" shich did not work...

You could try setting "Style <mytitle> NakedTransient". If that
doesn't do it (which it wouldn't if the window isn't set transient),
you could try "Style <mytitle> NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0".

The width of the border around windows is set in two ways:
1) "Style <mytitle> HandleWidth N" by default, and if "Style <mytitle>
Handles" is specified.
2) "Style <mytitle> BorderWidth N" if "Style <mytitle> NoHandles" is
used or the client indicates that it shouldn't be resized.

Try "Style <mytitle> HandleWidth 0" instead of ".. NoHandles".

Cheers,
Tim.

Groan. Thanks!  I obviously missed the option in the man page.

OK, so now another question.

A much more infuriating thing is the way fvwm moves me around on the
desktop as focus passes from one window to the next, if windows happen 
to be off-page.

How do I tell fvwm that Focus means Focus, it doesn't mean I want to
see the window?

BorderWidth 0 fixed it, however it'd be nice if 2.3.16 granted the option as
2.3.13 did -- whenever a window wants to have no title it should be able to do
so :) Is this a bug or a feature? :)

The fact the Eterm could make borders disappear in 2.3.13 is a
mis-feature of Eterm. It used to work because the window borders were a
direct ancestor of the Eterm window and it fails now because they are
now an aunt.

If an X program wants a borderless window it can use the Motif or
OpenLook window manager hints (which have been working for years).
Admittedly, it can't switch the borders on and off once it has started.

Cheers,
Tim.

How can I configure fvwm to allow a desktop larger than the visible area?
For example, I want a 4096x4096 desktop (my visible resolution is
1280x1024), where I can pan or scroll to reach all parts of the desktop.

Thanks in advance for your help.

  that's outside of scope of fvwm (AFAIK).

  you can reconfigure the X server (at least some of them) to have
virtual screen larger then your physical screen, for Xfree86 change the
XF86Config, look for the Screen definitions at the end (check the docs
for exact syntax, there is something about virtual resolution, I don't
have docs handy)

  you can achieve something similar with fvwm by setting EdgeScroll and
EdgeResistance in fvwm configuration file.

Hi,

1. Does anyone know if it's possible to order the TaskBar to only show
   applications in the current virtual desktop (ie. FvwmPager mode)?

   (If I have 18 applications open in 3 desktops, I'd much rather have
   6 show up in each desktop's TaskBar, rather than all 18 in each
   desktop's TaskBar as currently happens).

2. Since I suspect from reading the man page that it is not possible
   to do that, is it possible to create a simulated TaskBar using
   FvwmButtons and FvwmIconMan?  

   I have only the haziest idea about these functions, so I would be
   grateful for any answers (and fvwm2rc samples!)

Thanks very much,
Rohan.

hi, all:

Using Solaris, fvwm as x-window manager.  The repeat rate of Keyboard is 
just too slow.  How to increase the repeat rate?  Probably it is not a 
problem of FVWM.  Anyway, if you know how to change it, pls let me know.

thanks,

jack

I don't think it's possible.

Sure. Depending upon how exact you want things, it's easy or hard to
do. Take a look at http://www.best.com/~mikehan/fvwm2rc.html and
fvwm2rc.tgz for an example of the same principle (though what I've
done is created two small FvwmIconMan instances, one of which is
showing current page and the other showing everything not on the
current page.

Anyway, the simplest example I can give you would probably look like
this:

*FvwmButtons( Swallow FvwmIconMan "Module FvwmIconMan" )
*FvwmIconMan*resolution desk

After that you'd need to start tuning things to look nice, put in the
Start button and clock, etc.

It is not possible with the 2.2.x (or inferior) version. But, it is
possible with the devel version since 2.3.? (for fvwm-devel: NEWS does 
not mention this! and I've not found any entries about this in the
change log). So if you use your machine for fun try the latest devel
version 2.3.15 (current status: feature freeze beta, need help for
debugging!).

  I've suffered this for a while with the GUI builder I've used (I'm
trying to find the archived mailings that mention it).

  In my case, it boiled down to: the windows are *created* correctly -
(0,0) puts the *border* at (0,0) - but if they're moved (my GUI builder
creates all windows at a default location, then MoveResizes them to the
correct location [which for reasons too complex to go into can't be
determined until the window's been created].

  A MoveResize to (0,0) actually locates the *window* to 0,0, putting the
border off-screen. [Sparc/Solaris 2.5.1 fvwm2.3.13]

  I think there was some question as to what was actually the correct
functionality, although ISTR Dominik (he's off on hols. at the mo. isn't
he?) mentioning some window-placement chanhge he did that might cause it
that he was planning on taking back out.


  Nope, I've utterly failed to find the discussion I had about it,
probably late last year. It must've hung off the end of another thread,
instead of being a thread of it's own. Thus, I can't find whether a
'solution' was arrived at.

  Check out "Window Position Change?" thread of Jan 2000 in the archives.
I sent a small demo. C prog. that illustrates the 'problem'.

  The thread died without a resolution.

Curiously, it was possible with fvwm2-2.0.46-12.

       *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly
              Tells FvwmTaskBar to show the windows that are only
              on  the  current  desktop.    When   desktops   are
              switched,  the list of windows changes accordingly.

Why did it disappear later? - I'm just curious.

Is it coming back in the same way?

Merci beaucoup (that's mercy buccops to you John!)

I considered upgrading to 2.3.* but decided to wait for a release
version.

In the meantime, (I use RedHat-6.1) I got the RPMs for fvwm2 and
fvwm2-icons from the RedHat-5.2 distribution tree, installed them with
--nodeps -Uvh, stuck "*FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly" in system.fvwm2rc, and now
the TaskBar works exactly as I want it to!

Exce-e-l-l-e-ent!  (I'm on the East coast, so I can't say that in the
right West coast way).  This is the fastest question-to-solution
turnaround time I've ever seen on a mailing list.

cheers
Rohan.

Curiouser and curiouser. Only the manpage entry ever disappeared. All
the code appears (from a cursory examination) still to be present.

>Is it coming back in the same way?

It'd be pretty trivial to add the entry back to the manpage... Maybe
I'll submit the patch, unless someone else gets to it first. Anyway,
the option still exists in the current betas, so I'm guessing it's
always been there.

Hey Mike -- before rolling my FVWM back to the RedHat-5.2 version I
tested the *FvwmTaskBarDeskOnly command in RedHat-6.1, and it didn't
work.  So the absence might be more than just in the manpage, though
once the beta rolls out I guess that won't be an issue.

The version in Redhat-6.1 is fvwm2-2.2.2-3.  I'll have a shot at
reconfirming the absence of the functionality in that version when I
get home tonight.

Thanks again, everyone.

cheers,
Rohan.

Hmm, curiouser still! It doesn't *work* (at least not for me) in
fvwm2-2.2.2-3.i386.rpm (as default in Red Hat 6.1 distribution). So maybe it's
omission from the man page (which still has the same date as in
fvwm2-2.0.46-12!) is not an accident....

The plot thickens!

Okay, I must've been smoking something this morning, because the
DeskOnly command *is* present in the manpage in the latest betas. And
groveling over the history, I see that it was added around 2.3.6, so
it wouldn't be found in 2.2.x. But it definitely is in 2.3.7+. Sorry
for the confusion.

Hi,

I'm kind of new to FVWM w-manager.  I've just setup FVWM2 for my Sun 
Solaris machine and I'm wondering if there is a way to display an image
(gif, jpg, etc.) as a desktop background. Is it possible to do that?

Thank you in advance,

Hop

Yes, its possible.  Unless you are using FvwmBacker, this is not really
an fvwm issue.

You can put an image on your background with "xv" "xloadimage", "xli",
and probably lots of other programs.

If you have 8 bit color, be sure to limit the number of colors used.

You probably want to put the command to set the background in
$HOME/.xinitrc.

Jack,

	Are you using CDE on Solaris?

	If so, the easiest way (relative to doing ANYTHING
	under CDE!) is to modify the file:

		/etc/dt/config/XServers 

	by changing the last line, which should look something like
	this:   

:0   Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner	

	Add the option  "-ar1 NNN" like so:

:0   Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 \
		-nobanner -ar1 249

	Adjust "249" to whatever you feel comfortable with.
	AFAIK, trial-and-error is the only way to experiment.

	This, of course, has nothing to do with fvwm.  :-)

Bill

My biggest problem with the wharf is that even with MaxSwallow, some apps
run too wide and are cut off. Here's the relevant section of my .fvwm2rc:

# FVWM WHARF

*FvwmWharfGeometry +1076+0
*FvwmWharfTextureType 1
*FvwmWharfTextureColor midnightblue lightblue
*FvwmWharfFullPush
*FvwmWharfMaxColors 256

# The actual wharf apps:
# *FvwmWharf wmtime nil MaxSwallow "wmtime" wmtime -digital &
# *FvwmWharf wmdate nil MaxSwallow "wmdate" wmdate -s &
# *FvwmWharf wmcpu nil MaxSwallow "wmcpu" wmcpu -l &
# *FvwmWharf wmsysmon nil MaxSwallow "wmsysmon" wmsysmon &
# *FvwmWharf wmppp nil MaxSwallow "wmppp" wmppp -t 1 &

*FvwmWharf asmounter - MaxSwallow "asmounter" asmounter &
*FvwmWharf wmppp - MaxSwallow "wmppp" wmppp -t 1 &

Asmon and wmppp are the troublemakers. Any idea why, and what I can do?

Thanks.

I have an xclock, an xbiff and the Desktops on the Xwindow, when I open
netscape or other large windows, they are shaded by these foreground
windows, and it takes trouble to have them appear foreground. Can I make
them always foreground?
another question, can I make minimized icons of, say, netscape, appear
always foreground?
Thanks,
Jifeng,

my system is running for some time with a few apps that are more
complex than xterms (emacs, netscape, acrobat...), the keybindings
defined in .fvwm2rc stop working. All of them, so it's not just
bindings overlapping with application keybindings. I also can't
pinpoint when exactly it happens, I can't say "I did this and they
dissapeared", sometimes I can work for a long time with many apps
open, sometimes it happens very early. Restarting fvwm2 doesn't help,
shutting down apps doesn't help either, only logging out and back in
does fix the problem. The system I'm on uses Solaris 2.6. and fvwm2
release 2.0.45.

In the fvwm 2.2.x series check the man page for "staysontop".
In the latest betas, look up "layers".

You can always raise/lower  things around on your own.   I have a  Sun
keyboard with a "front" key.  If I need to see the clock, its a single
keystroke away.  (You can use any key you like.)

A while ago, I hacked up SSxbiff to toggle the scroll  lock led on the
keyboard.  (Use "xset".)  Since then  actually seeing SSxbiff became a
non-issue.  (I  don't have to even   unlock the display.)  Too  bad it
doesn't work with Exceed.

Can I suggest using something more current.
2.0.45 is way old.

Have you checked the status of your numlock led?

 Man, that's embarassing: indeed, if numlock's on, the bindings
disappear, if it's off they're back again. I still think it has 
happened without my touching numlock, maybe an app automatically
switched it, or maybe I did it without remembering... Can I avoid
this problem in any other way then to keep numlock switched off
at all times?

You can add identical keybindings for both states of Numlock on/off, then
it won't matter.

Providing you have space, anyone can install fvwm.

Join a long line of "keybindings disappearing" questioners, but at
least you gave it a unique spellin. :)

The latest versions of fvwm go as far as providing an "ignoremodiers"
command.  Visit our web page and check out the FAQ for a comprehensive
treatment of the subject.

Hi all,

here's a quick question: Is it possible to raise a window and rotate it
to the top of the windowlist without having to give that window the
keyboard focus?

Below follows a description of what I want, and what I've tried so
far. Please tell me what I overlooked...

I would like to set up fvwm2 such that I can cyclically raise all
windows with the PageUp / PageDown keys, i.e. repeated PageDown
keystrokes should raise one window after the other, allowing me to find
a window which I've buried too deep. I use MouseFocus, and I'd like to
be able to move the mouse pointer over the root window, and then start
cycling, so no application will receive these keystrokes, and I won't
have to snatch the PageDown keystrokes away from an application which
may have a use for it.

The most simple approach

    Key Next         R         N     Next [*] Raise

does not work, because the raised window does not become current, so
repeated PageDown keystrokes will just raise the same window again,
i.e. effectively do nothing.

It seems that the only command for rotating the windowlist is Focus,
so I tried:

    Key Next         R         N     Function Next-Focus-and-Raise

    AddToFunc Next-Focus-and-Raise  "I" Next [*] Raise
    +                               "I" Next [*] Focus

This works once, but not repeatedly. Somewhat weirdly, the the Focus
command gives the keyboard focus to the target window, even though
this is inconsistent with MouseFocus if the mouse pointer is over the
root window. As a result, all but the first PageDown keypresses are
sent to the application owning the target window instead of being
processed by fvwm2.

A while ago, I have settled for

    Key Next         A        CM     Function Next-Focus-and-Raise

However, I am not satisfied with this solution, because (1) I don't
like having the window manager taking away keypresses from applications
which do have the keyboard focus and (2) I find pressing
Ctrl-Alt-PageDown quite inconvenient, so I don't use this as often as I
might do otherwise.

Thanx in advance for any hints.

Greetinx, Jan

No.  The windowlist is always headed by the window that has focus and is
used as the starting point for next/prev commands in functions.

The focus command has to work no matter what focus style is used or it
would be useless.  MouseFocus just means that an implicit focus command
is run every time the mouse enters a window. ClickToFocus does the focus
command when the mouse is clicked on a window.

Correct. The key binding is for the root context only, it means it is
active when no window has the focus, it doesn't mean active when the
mouse is in the root window.  If you want that you could bind a mouse
button:

Mouse 1 R N Function Next-Focus-and-Raise

A solution for (2) is to use a more convenient key binding. I use KP_Add
and KP_Subtract.  I haven't found a program yet thatneed these and can't
use the normal plus/minus keys.

(1) is difficult.  As you have found you can't have keyboard driven
circulation without moving the focus, therefore you have to take those
keys away from applications.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi,

how can I make the WindowList appear in the center of the screen and
not where the mouse pointer is?

Hi,

I am using the following bindings to scroll the viewport:

# Alt-<CursorKey> scroll viewport
Key Left   A M Scroll  -100 0
Key Right  A M Scroll  100  0
Key Up     A M Scroll  0 -100
Key Down   A M Scroll  0  100

Let's assume that I have to desks, each with a xterm. xterm1 on desk
one has the focus. Now I do Meta-Right and change to desk 2. I can now
see xterm2, but it does not have focus, as the focus is still on
desk1, xterm1. 

How can I achieve that the focus does not stay with xterm1 but changes
to xterm2? Hope I made myself clear.

Regards,
Chris

Ok. Does this imply that the root window is in the window list, and is
just skipped by the Next and Prev commands?

This means that fvwm's focus policies are built on top of the functionality
that is accessible with the Focus command? Thanks for this info. If I
understood this correctly, then the question would become: Is there a
command which I could use to reclaim the focus for the root window? E.g.
could I simulate a mouseclick at the current position? Or is there some
generic name or classname for the root window, that I could append a line
like

    +                               "I" Next [Root] Focus

to the Next-Focus-and-Raise function shown above?

Ok, but all three mouse buttons are used for popup menus. It's true,
though, that I don't use them that frequently. Furthermore, now that I
think of it, I like the idea of using the mouse instead of the keyboard
as I have to move the mouse onto a patch of root window anyway. Thanks
for pointing this out.

This is a matter of habits, I guess -- xcalc is perfectly happy with the
normal plus and minus keys, but personally, I find it more convenient to
use the keypad with xcalc...

An alternative might be to take the focus away from the applications
after briefly giving it to them (as already mentioned above).

What you can do is create a function and call the function from your
keybindings:

AddToFunc ScrollWithFocus I Scroll $0 $1
+                         I Prev (CurrentDesk) Focus

Key Left   A M ScrollWithFocus -100 0
...

I just made up the function, so it may not be exactly right, but I
think you get the idea.

No, 'fraid not, the windowlist is the list of windows that fvwm is
managing i.e. the windows that fvwm can move/iconify/resize etc..

I don't know of a way to do this.  I don't think sending a mouse click
to the root is the way to go as you have already bound some menus to all
the mouse buttons. What is needed is an UnFocus command. I tried a quick
hack program to send an EnterNotify event to fvwm and fvwm gets the
message but fails to move the focus. I'm not sure why it fails, here's
the program:


#include <X11/Xlib.h>

main()
{
  Display *dpy;
  int scr;
  Window root;
  XEvent event;

  dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
  scr = DefaultScreen(dpy);
  root = DefaultRootWindow(dpy);
  event.xcrossing.type = EnterNotify;
  event.xcrossing.display = dpy;
  event.xcrossing.window = root;
  event.xcrossing.root = root;
  event.xcrossing.subwindow = None;
  event.xcrossing.focus = True;
  XSendEvent(dpy, root, False, EnterWindowMask, &event);
  XCloseDisplay(dpy);
}

Cheers,
Tim.

Acutually I had to change (CurrentDesk) to (CurrentPage) in the second
line to make it work with desks that don't have windows on it, but now
it works nicely. Thanks Mike!

I work in a french environment and at time I need to send correspondence
in french. Is there a way to switch from engish keys to french keys and 
visa versa with fvwm2. I know that it can be done with KDE window manager
but I don't particularly like KDE? 

Thanks for any help.

You could probably use xkeycaps [http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/] to generate 
your two different keymaps, and then have a little script to flip between
them.

Try the xkeycaps program.
I think you can use it to create an .xmodmap file to change the keysyms
(?).

Does this work for the following case (this is one of the big annoyances I
have with fvwm2):

Say you have multiple desktops (I assume this works with multiply-paged
desktops, too, although I don't have this configuration). Try the following.
Put the mouse pointer into a window (SloppyFocus, possibly
FocusFollowsMouse) and stickyfy it. Then switch desktops. What happens for
me is that no window has the focus and none of my keybindings work!

I would love to know if that's what I have to do to fix it or if this is a
real bona fide bug in fvwm2 that nobody's ever had problems with...

In the developement version 2.3 a menu position (WindowList is a menu) is
fully configurable. For example, Ctrl-Mouse2 does what you want:

Mouse 2 R C WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort, SelectOnRelease

You can take a look at FvwmKb module at freshmeat or sourceforge.
This module is not part of the official fvwm, because of C++. Supposedly
it will be added in fvwm 2.5 series.

OK, but there is a case when you try to scroll from upper left page to left
or up direction and nothing should change.

So you need a little correction to your function:

# I am using Sloppy focus so I want warp mouse pointer to window title
AddToFunc CurrentRaiseWarp I Current (!Visible) Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 16p

# going to previous active non iconic window
AddToFunc GoToLast I Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus

# if page is the same do not change active window
AddToFunc WasActive I DestroyFunc GoToLast
+ I AddToFunc GoToLast I Nop

# choose last active window, activate and warp to it
AddToFunc LastActive I Current (CurrentPage !Iconic) Function WasActive
+ I Function GoToLast
+ I Current (CurrentPage !Iconic) Function CurrentRaiseWarp
+ I DestroyFunc GoToLast
+ I AddToFunc GoToLast I Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic) FlipFocus


AddToFunc ScrollPrev I Scroll $0 $1
+ I Function LastActive

# scroll one page
Key Left        A C1    Function ScrollPrev -100 0
Key Left        A C12   Function ScrollPrev -100 0
Key Right       A C1    Function ScrollPrev 100 0
Key Right       A C12   Function ScrollPrev 100 0
Key Up          A C1    Function ScrollPrev 0 -100
Key Up          A C12   Function ScrollPrev 0 -100
Key Down        A C1    Function ScrollPrev 0 100
Key Down        A C12   Function ScrollPrev 0 100

# change page and go to the lastactive window on that page
AddToFunc GoPagePrev I GoToPage $0 $1
+ I Function LastActive

Key 1 A C1      Function GoPagePrev 0 0
Key 1 A C12     Function GoPagePrev 0 0

Key 2 A C1      Function GoPagePrev 1 0
Key 2 A C12     Function GoPagePrev 1 0

# after window closing go to last active one
*FvwmEvent destroy_window LastActive

If you have many desks you should add CurrentDesk to the conditions list.

Hello,

I need Sloppy/MouseFocus but working only while I move the window pointer.
In other cases I need behaviour like ClikToFocus:

1. newly mapped window gets focus;
2. after destroying window focus goes to previous on the list nevermind where
the mouse pointer is (on the same desk and page)
3. while moving window as a frame window list order not changes

Is this possible to get this kind of behaviour?
Regards

Hello,

I am using an application that intercepts Alt + Tab but when I press
these Fvwm2 intercepts the keystroke combination and pops up a
menu of current windows. If this behavior is default (I cannot find
any Alt + Tab bindings in my .fvwm2rc) then how can I disable it?

I'm running fvwm2 version 2.3.15, XFree86 3.3.2

My .fvwm2rc is at

http://www.math.mun.ca/~nzanella/computing/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc

Thanks,

Neil

I have the following keybinding that work with previous versions of
XFree86:

Key Left        A       C       CursorMove -1 +0
Key Right       A       C       CursorMove +1 +0

Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove +00 +10

When i upgraded to XFree86 4.0, and enabled 2 heads, using Xinerama, I have
one giant resolution and nothing knows differently:

xdpyinfo results:

default screen number:    0
number of screens:    1

screen #0:
  dimensions:    3200x1200 pixels (1084x406 millimeters)
  ...

anyways, the problem is that if the cursor is on my primary monitor,
everything works fine, but if I'm on the secondary monitor, then the
control+arrows stop working. no response at all. All other fvwm keys seem
to work just fine, just control+arrows stop (or so I've noticed).

Now, its not that fvwm isnt getting the keys, since when i hit
control+arrows, my xterm temporarily looses focus, just like normal (the
cursor becomes hollow until i let go of the arrow key).

xev dumps of when I hit control+left arrow once and let go:

Everything is the same, except timestamps and the coordinates that the

Any ideas on getting this key to work?

That doesn't mean that fvwm gets the events.  It only indicates
that the application noticed something.

If Xinerama is really what I think (a large root window;
applications are unable to tell the difference between
one big and many small monitors), this looks lika a bug
in the Xinerama code.

You can have this with the 'GrabFocus' style option in
the current beta versions.

That would be very hard to implement.  With SloppyFocus fvwm has
to update the focus window whenever it receives a EnterWindow event.
If you destroy a window and switch focus to the last window, fvwm
will receive an EnterWindow event for the window below the cursor
immediately after the focus is switched.  Now, how can you
distinguish between a EnterWindow that was caused by mouse motion
and one caused by the previous window with the pointer being
unmapped?

> 3. while moving window as a frame window list order not changes

What is this good for?

Icon labels use the same colours as the window title.  In the next
release (i.e. after 2.4) I'll probably make it possible to have
different colours.

Yah, one large root window. so thats what I was thinking, but I can't
possibly see how Xinerama has anything to do with this.

xev is still getting the same events. I wrote a program to wrap the pointer
around and it works just fine on the second monitor. The control key works
in applications, the rest of the fvwm key bindings still function.

I'd like to pinpoint the problem here, and either get it fixed in FVWM or
Xinerama. You know fvwm code inside out, so I figured you would be able=
 to
help me with ideas on making sure the bug is not in FVWM. Then I can go
talk to XFree people.

But fvwm knows that a window is destroyed so maybe there should be an option
to warp pointer to the window which was the previous on the list.
Just ignore EnterWindow event and switch focus to proper window.
We could set a flag meaning that there was a window closing operation.


> > 3. while moving window as a frame window list order not changes
> What is this good for?

If you set OpaqueMoveSize below 100 and  click on the window title then
move the frame and mouse moves above other window that window is set as
top on the list. So list order is changeing which disturbs functionality
of switching to last active window function (bind to Alt+ESC ESC).
On the contrary while OpaqueMoveSize is 100 there is no problem because 
the mouse pointer is always above the current ative window.
So maybe there is a problem with EnterWindow event too.
Setting inner flag that fvwm is doing something with the active window
and EnterWindow events will be ignored till the end of operation
should solve the problem.

Nice feature wolud be if functions called by FvwmEvent module could have
windowid of window for  which this event appeared addeed as an argument
to them. It is not always Current window so in this case you can't get to
this window to execute any operation on it.

This doesn't happen to me, no focus changes happen when moving the
rubberband around.

*FvwmEventPassID does exactly this.

May be I should add that this appears while I have SloppyFocus/MouseFocus.

In 2.3 betas - but I'am using 2.2.4 so forget about that.

Conclusion - must use new version because old 2.2.4 just can't do that.

The only thing I can think of is printing out all KeyPress
events in HandleKeyPress() (events.c) and see if fvwm gets
the cursor keys at all.  If not try printing out all keys
that are unbound in libs/Bindings.c in the GrabWindowKey()
function.  If they're not unbound there, then it must be
a XFree bug (?).

And how can i change the color for inactive buttons on the titelbar?
I have set a white font on a black background for all inactive windows.
Now fvwm is drawing every vector button with black on black
and also the little position window, if i'm moving or resizing a window.
Can i change this behavior?

  I think I know this one!

  You'll need to either duplicate the titlebar defs. in your
[AddTo]ButtonStyle command [by doing a ButtonStyle with the title-bar
sutff ,*then* an AddToButtonStyle with your actual button decor. This'll
draw the button is]n two passes: one with the title-bar decs., one with
the button decs. You can AddTo as many times as you want; each will add a
layer of drawing to the button.


  Simpler, and probably what you want, is to bung the UseTitleStyle flag
on the button. If you want all your buttons to inherit title-bar styles,
just do:

ButtonStyle All  -- UseTitleStyle

  ... before doing other ButtonStyles. I put 'Raised' in there too.


  Note that this *doesn't* draw the title-bar under the button first, then
draw the button; rather, it draws the button first /in the same way/ as it
draws the title-bar.

  I'd prefer the former, since the way it is when you have tiled pixmaps,
the buttons restart the tiling, so it doesn't match up with the
title-bar's tiling, but there you go ...

Hello,

I would like to do the following in my .fvwm2rc file:

I would like to define a parametrized macro called

string(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)

in the Fvwm2rc file. Then I would like Fvwm to preprocess the
parametrized string and make the appropriate substitutions throughout
the file before processing it.

How do I do this?

I guess I would have to use M4 but I am not very familiar with it.

Thanks,

Neil

I ran into an unexpected problem when updating to fvwm 2.2.2 with my
SuSE 6.3 distribution.  FVWM2 has always worked in the past and I can't
quite figure out what to do now.  I'm no expert at this.

When loading some graphics programs, notably Gimp and Compupic, windows
in the mouse focus are colored properly, but those out of focus have
some really strange "reversed" colors.  In addition, after closing one
of these programs I have to restart FVWM2 because subsequent windows
come up without the border and in the upper left of the screen, making
them unusable.  I have tried two different graphics cards, one a plain
vanilla S3-Virge.  The behavior has me scratching my head because I've
run these programs for years without problems.

Does anyone know of a fix?

Probably, you use an X server that is able to display only a limited
amount of colors. In such cases, the X server uses the colors it can
display to show the window which has the focus in the colors it has
requested. As a consequence, all other windows are shown in random,
psychedelic false colors, and this pattern changes abruptly when the
keyboard focus is moved to another window -- a phenomenon known as
colormap flashing.

I don't know about this one.

Did you try the cards without installing the corresponding X server? In
that case, you are likey using the generic VGA X server, which has only
16 colors. (This doesn't mean your card can't do better, just the plain
vanilla VGA X server never uses such capabilities, thix X server is
commonly used as a least common denominator for initial system installations
and the like.)

If you have used the X server for your card, try running it in true color
mode (``startx -- -bpp 24'' or ``startx -- -bpp 32''). If this doesn't
work, check your XF86Config file.

Since these issues are only indirectly related to fvwm, you might ask
your question on a SuSE or Linux related newsgroup or mailing list, as
people there may be able to give you more competent advice.

Greetinx, Jan

Hi folks. I haven't kept as current as I'd like to with Fvwm2 versions,
but I just upgraded to 2.2.4 this weekend and have run across a problem
with FvwmButtons configuration that is making me pull my hair out. The
following lines worked in the previous 2.2.X beta version I was using
but completely break in the new version, yet the man page for
FvwmButtons doesn't seem to be much different than the last version I
used.

Here's one example. I have a verticle bar on the right side of the
screen. It's set up like this.

*VertButtonsGeometry -1+0
*VertButtonsColumns 1

then I have a clock in the top button, which used to launch plan when
clicked on. here's the line that defined it.

*VertButtons( Title foo, Swallow(NoTitle) "asclock" 'Exec asclock -12 -led Yellow &', Action 'Exec "plan"  plan  &' )

and another button that loaded Netscape with a shell wrapper, invoking
one version of netscape if the left button was pressed and another if
the right one was.

*VertButtons( Icon Jnetscape.xpm, Action(mouse 1) 'Exec "Netscape" /home/jhenders/bin/run.netscape &', \
Action(mouse 3) 'Exec "" /home/jhenders/bin/run.netscape4 &' )

Now when I try to run either of these, I get the following error and
nothing happens.

No such module 'Exec "plan" plan' in ModulePath '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2'

Does anyone know what changed in the parsing of these lines and how I
could fix it?

I found the problem with my FvwmButtons configuration. Since the last
beta I had installed, the parser has gotten more strict, and now refuses
to allow spaces between ( and ) and any other characters. I don't know
if this is intentional or a bug but I think if it's intentional it
should be better documented.

To clarify this will work.

*FvwmButtons(Title Help, Icon xman.xpm, Action 'Exec xman &')

while this will not (but formerly did)

*FvwmButtons( Title Help, Icon xman.xpm, Action 'Exec xman &' )

Hi my name is Jake.

I have been using fvwm2 for not long.
But I wish to ask a couple of questions.

1.  what's a graphical setup program that I can use to set up fvwm2 so that 
I can have "shortcut icons" (buttons) on the desktop, just like in 
winhorrible95.

I ask because I wish to use Linux as a replacement for w95.

That's all for now.  If someone can reply with detailed instructions or a 
slap on the wrist and link to the appropriate archive search etc., then I 
would be grateful.

Cheers
J

Sure.  I have tried Gnome and KDE - but they both are memory hungry and I 
have a slow machine.

Is there a way to include menu items and have a menu on the desktop at all 
times?

Right now fvwm menus can't be pinned to the desktop but anything a menu
can do FvwmButtons can do.  See below.

Right now fvwm doesn't come with a graphical setup program.
If you visit our web page and look under links the Dotfile generator
or FvwmConf may help you out in that department.

To put buttons on your desktop to launch things you might consider
using FvwmButtons.

Okay, that information gave me enough information to root it out.  I
ended up going back to 16-bit (64K colors).  Thanks.

No, I like E in many ways, but it's just not as flexible as FVWM.  It's
also a lot more memory-hungry than FVWM.  I run FVWM (which is why I'm on
this list :-)  And of course, you /can/ use FVWM with GNOME if you choose
to do so (I did this for a long time).

However, FVWM can't do some things that make sense in the GNOME world.  For
instance, the GNOME pager won't work without a GNOME-compliant window
manager such as Enlightenment.  There are some other decoration hint type
of things also.  All in all it's not a big deal - but if you're talking
about Linux (which I think we were here) they're probably already installed
on the machine by default, so it isn't a big deal to load it up and give it
a try, in any case.  With a tiny bit of dot-file editing you can make GNOME
use fvwm or anything else (bb, sawmill, twm, etc).

FVWM is more flexible and lightweight which is why I use it.  And I have a
Sparc Ultra-II class system on my desktop, so I'm not strapped for
resources.  I just like my wm to not be sluggish (half the goal of a window
manager, IMHO, should be to become invisible so you barely even notice it's
there in the first place).

You can try to add this line to your .fvwm2rc (replace BLENDER by the real
window string, which can be obtained by running FvwmIdent on that window):

Style BLENDER NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

If you want to manage border-less and title-less windows, you can bind:

# Alt-Mouse2 inside window moves/raise-lowers
Mouse 2 	W	M	Function FuncFvwmMoveOrRaiseLower
# Alt-Mouse3 inside window brings window-ops menu
Mouse 3 	W	M	Menu MenuFvwmWindowOps

or similar (you should define this function and menu of course).

Regards,
Mikhael.

So I tracked it down to the XWarpPointer() call.. the actual numbers fvwm
was coming up with were correct, and it was passing them to XWarpPointer()
correctly too.

The only difference in my xwarppointer code and the fvwm code was that the
src window arg (2nd arg) is set to the root window in fvwm, and its set=
 to
None in my code.

I replaced the 2nd arg with None in builtins.c on line 509 for fvwm-2.1.13
(the only call to XWarpPointer() in the file) and all works for me now with
XFree86 4.0.

Why was this set to the root window at all? From the manpage:

    However, if src_w is a window, the move only takes place if the window
    src_w contains the pointer and if the specified rectangle of src_w
    contains the pointer.


I have submitted a bug to XFree86, but if there is no real reason why the
src_w should be root, then can this change be made in the cvs repository=
 so
future fvwms can work with XFree86 4.0?


Now it seems I have random RaiseLower issues.. I wonder if their window
stacking stuff is broken. This one is much harder to reproduce, so it might
take a while.

  I've read few times that enlightenment is not as flexible as fvwm but
I've seen no actual comparison of features. I have enlightenment on my
home machine (actually, I am trying it out as default window manager for
about a week now). and while the lot of settings can be changed using
menus there is still lot of what cannot be changed in settings menu
(most of it can be probably changed somehow). I have to say that  I have
strong feeling that they really got what they sdaid in the beginning -
the eye candy (that's what I've read on enlightenment web page as a
reason why they started the development of enlightenment). however it
looks like it is not ment to be used... (just to be looked at). that's
more gut feeling than anything else...

  is there some brief comparison of features of enlightenment <-> fvwm?
I mean what can fvwm do that enlightenment cannot and vice versa?
anybody has enough experience with both to comment on this? any
pointers?

  thanks.

I've been usuing Fvwm for about 8 years now and I like how it has evolved.

>From what I've heard from the KDE people is that their new window manager will
have the kind of functionality that fvwm has. it will be able to have a small
memory footprint which can be increased as new features are desired.
to add styles you simply add a dynamically loaded module. I guess it's just a
matter how basic they decide the manager can be and what eyecandy and
unessential features they put in to the modules.

have the fvwm developers had a look at this? I know it was sort of the plan for
fvwm3. what will fvwm do? wind up or follow?

Fvwm modules are already dynamically loaded.

But I bet you have something else in mind...

This may seem like a stupid question, but placate me as I'm new to the fvwm
community. A project was thrown at me about a year ago where I had to 'learn'
fvwm REAL fast. Suffice it to say that I managed to stumble my way through it
and got it working (but it was no work of art!).

Now I have a new project with similar requirements, but this time, I'd like to
be more 'professional'. So my question is: Where is the best place to start?
Have there been any publications (books, etc.) written for the fvwm programmer?
(I'd prefer to have something on hard copy so that I can study it without being
tied to a system.)

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave

If you really want paper, start with:

man fvwm2 | lpr

(Assuming you have installed fvwm.)

Our web site has the man pages and lots more info.

Hi,
    I am new to Linux, and FVWM. My Red Hat Linux
distribution (that's 6.1) comes with fvwm2.x and I
would like to know how you configure the X Window
System to load FVWM instead of the gnome desktop
environment? Any suggestions?

Anything appreciated!

Thank you!

I changed the file '/etc/sysconfig/desktop' to contain the
single line 'AnotherLevel', referring to RH's somewhat W95-ish
decor for fvwm2 (which I personally have hacked to make less
W95-ish).  This takes effect in the script '/etc/X11/xinit/Xclients'.

I change /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc to achieve the result:

right at the end of this file there is a command to execute the window
manager.

I add something like the following:

if [ -f $HOME/.wm_style ]; then
        exec `cat $HOME/.wm_style`
elif [ -x `which fvwm2` ]; then
        exec fvwm2
else
        twm &
        xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &
        xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &
        xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &
        exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login
fi                                                  

Which simply executes whatever window manager is listed in 
$HOME/.wm_style. If this file does not exist, I default to fvwm2 or twm.

This has been tested on RH6.0 (the latest one I used before moving to BSD)

Is there any way to move a window and keep one of its coordinates constant?
For example, I'd like to move a window to the top of the screen, but keep
its position with respect to the side of the screen constant. I know I can
do this with moving the window around by keystrokes; I'm just wondering if
it can be bound to a key.

If you can't do that, can it be submitted as a feature request? And maybe it
will also pay attention to things like SnapAttraction? :)

I noticed that a couple of other people have responded already as to how
they managed to do this.  What I personally think is the most simple way
to do this is to put a .xsession or .Xclients file in your home directory.
If you look at the file

/etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/Default

you will see

$ cat Default 
#!/bin/bash -login

/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession

(yep, that's it...)

Now if you look at this file you will find a bunch of stuff at the top
which handles the case in which the Xsession script was called with
arguments.  In the case that no arguments were supplied (which is what
we're interested in with the Default script) the script falls back onto
this

# otherwise, take default action
if [ -x "$HOME/.xsession" ]; then
    exec "$HOME/.xsession"
elif [ -x "$HOME/.Xclients" ]; then
    exec "$HOME/.Xclients"
elif [ -x /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients ]; then
    exec /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients
else
    exec xsm
fi

So, if you simply put a .xsession file in your home directory which runs
fvwm2 you're set!  Looking at this Xsession script will suggest that one
way to do this is to call switchdesk just as they do in the case that you 
choose AnotherLevel. Another way is to call 

/usr/X11/bin/RunWM._______

where the ______ is Fvwm95 or which the decors which you want.  I'm
assuming that it's still around in the base install of RH6.1 

Of course there are many other ways as well, but I think I've more than
answered your question. :-)

  Use the 'w' suffix of the ordinate for 'Move' (see man page). E.g.,

# Move to Y=40, keeping X same
Move 0w 40

Mmm...I see that now in the man page, but it's not explained. Thanks!

Hello,

I can't get the NoTitle style option to work with xv.

I am trying to get xv to place a window with no decoration at a
particular geometry on my screen but I cannot get rid of that title.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Neil

  Style "xv" NoTitle

This worked for me with version 2.2.2.  What have you tried so far?

Try using FvwmIdent to find out the `Class' or `Resource' of the window in
question and use that for the argument to the Style command.

It's definitely explained in the 2.3.15 man page, but perhaps
it's not in older versions.

Uh, there's a syntax error in your config line that previous versions
seem to have ignored:

> *VertButtons( ... Action 'Exec "plan"  plan  &' )
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This line should do it:

  *VertButtons( ... Action 'Exec plan &' )

or 

  *VertButtons( ... Action 'Exec exec plan &' )

Instead of the two suggestions already offered (which will work), you could
try use the `official' Red Hat way to choose desk top. This means going into
GNOME, and then in a terminal window type

	switchdesk

Choose the AnotherLevel option, log out and back in again. :-)

As mentioned, AnotherLevel is a `reasonable' configuration for fvwm2 from Red
Hat. You can hack it to improve it to your taste, or you could try a seriously
improved version of it by looking at

	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU/

(sorry, couldn't resist the advert.)

  I was wondering why is it a module - I always thought of this as basic
functionality of window manager. all the rest of the window manipulation
moving / resizing / focus / raise / lower) is built in, why is the auto
raise functionality in separate module? can we expect more of the
'basics' to go out into modules?

Things go into modules when:

Performance will be okay

It will save memory in the main executable

Not everone uses it


Someone made the judgement that FvwmAuto qualified.
Seems like the right decision to me.

No, the first "plan" is the xproperties name of the window, which is how
FvwmButtons knows to pop the button back up. At least that's how it's
worked since it was GoodStuff.

Does anyone know how to get that little location button to show up in
the centre of the screen? The one that pops up when you move a window
which shows you the x+y coords? It used to be in the centre of my screen
but since the new version it's showing up in the top left. I can't find
a config option for it.

Ancient history.

"Exec" no longer takes that argument.

I see what was going wrong. Xv attaches a string to the resource name
specified with -name.

Hmm. I guess the man page is still out of date then, as it has the
following still listed

       The command
              Any  fvwm command is recognized by FvwmButtons. See
              fvwm(1) for more info on this. The Exec command has
              a  small extension when used in Actions, its syntax
              is here:

                Exec ["hangon"] command

              When FvwmButtons finds such an  Exec  command,  the
              button  will  remain pushed in until a window whose
              name or class matches the  qouted  portion  of  the
              command is encountered.

Actually it looks like it's been moved back to a global. I had mwm in
Menustyle and now I had to add an

Emulate mwm

As a global variable again.

The man page is OK, its me.  Serves me right for attempting to answer
questions for a module I don't use.

My fault again, forget I put a 2.2.5 fvwm2 manpage in my manpath.
(2.2.5 seems to use either.)

2.3.15 has broken Style, this was fixed on the next day. Can you try the
daily snapshot? I am not aware about any problem with NoTitle in 2.3.14.

> Was there a .fvwm2rc usage change after 2.3.13?

All configuration changes are documented in NEWS file.

fixed in snapshot of 3/24.

another weirdity regarding styles....

Style "someprogram" NoIcon
Style "someprogram *somewindow*" Icon

When i start someprogram>somewindow and iconify it, NoIcon wins.
If i restart fvwm2, Icon wins

Also, is there a way for a click2focus user to tell it to not switch focus
when clicking on decor? I s'pose there some funcion trick to do it.

Thanx

I need an example config and a more detailed description to do
anything about it.  NoIconTitle works perfectly for me.  Are you sure
you recompiled everything properly?

The only explanation is this. When you start a program (say Netscape), it
has an initial title "someprogram", then after some timeout the program
changes the title (this is what Netscape does). The window still has the
NoIcon style option, because there was not any "someprogram *somewindow*"
string when it was mapped. When you execute RecaptureWindow or Restart
the styles are regenerated for this window accordingly to the new title.

If this is your case, there is nothing to be done here, just don't use
dynamic title names as style paterns, it is unreliable.

I don't think it is currently possible. You probably want a hypotetycal
ClickNonDecorsToFocus style option. You can send a feature request.

There is a not quite related bug - when clicking on unfocused ClickToFocus
window decor, the window is first raised even with ClickToFocusRaisesOff.

I think the developement version issues could be better discussed on
fvwm-workers@fvwm.org list.

Mikhael.

A default installation of FVWM2 doesn't load any wallpaper at startup.

The FvwmBacker module could be used to set a wallpaper.

Give us some details about the OS and configuration.

Sorry.  I'm using SuSE Linux.  The default configuration supplied by the
distribution loads what looks to be a tiled grainy grey pattern.  I've
been adding xphoon as the last line in InitFunction and RestartFunction
and that works okay, but FVWM2 still loads the wallpaper first.  The
only references in the file resembling what you mentioned are like
these:

*FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 1 -solid midnightblue
*FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid yellow...
etc., up to six.  The only reference to FvwmBacker other than that is a
menu item to a man page.

I assume this means six windows, all solid colors, overridden by the
tiled image.  I don't know the name of the tiled image and can't find it
on disk.

I'm familiar with the X default, and this isn't it.  This one has a

Hi,

I think I'm coming in on the middle of this, but have you tried to grep
for xpmroot or say xsri.

I'm not familiar with the SuSe dist. but if you use FvwmM4 it is quite
useful to use the -debug flag, giving you a copy of the .fvwm2rc file
which was put together.  In this case you can simply grep for files with 
"image format" suffices.

Other things you could try is to simply grep for grey or gray since most
us lack much imagination when naming images for tiling.

If none of this works, then send a little more info. like if you are using
FvwmM4, or cpp to construct a .fvwm2rc file.   If so, one thing you can do
is to look at the paths used for icons and image tiles such as
PixmapPath and IconPath.  If Fvwm2 is putting the wallpaper up then it
should be located in one of these paths.

HTH,
Tom

Well folks, I'm embarrassed now.  It was in both InitFunction and
RestartFunction with the filename "wall_suse.xpm."  It couldn't have
been more obvious. :-)

Incidently, for those who haven't been exposed to the SuSE distro, they
really take some time with their default .fvwm2rc, even though this
isn't the default wm for the distro.  They include bundles of 3d icons
also.

Hi,
    It's been a long while since I read about X, so apologies if I'm
miles off track.

    I'm pondering over the design of an application with lots of
"windows" - a sort of gigantic configurable control panel.

    One route I've seen people taking is writing such windows as
widgets in some toolkit language (e.g. Tcl/Tk) and then writing a
custom widget control manager in that language.

    But I was reminded of an interview I saw last year with (I
think) Jim Gettys, saying that the capabilities of X to embed
windows had been much underused.

    Which reminded me further of fvwm buttons ability to swallow
windows, and I then *seemed* to recall that fvwm had the ability
to run inside itself: advertised as being useful for debugging.
But I can't find any reference to that ability now.

    So finally my query: is it possible/sensible to run fvwm
inside another window manager instance,  controlling not the
display and the root window but instead a single large window,
swallowing and then managing all the top level windows of
my application?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Regards

Anthony

As far as my understanding is, the WM is a special X client that deals in
special ways with the server and root window.  This uniqueness allows for
only 1 of such types of apps at once. (if I'm wrong, someone correct me)

You might want to look into Xnest (part of XFree86), which runs a whole=
 new
X server inside an X window. You can run FVWM or whatever else you want
inside this window.

If I understand what you're saying, you might want to check out ctwm, which
allows a "captive" window manager -- basically another ctwm running in an X
window. Not sure how it accomplishes this, though.

I don't think it is currently possible. You probably want a hypotetycal
ClickNonDecorsToFocus style option. You can send a feature request.

There is a not quite related bug - when clicking on unfocused ClickToFocus
window decor, the window is first raised even with ClickToFocusRaisesOff.

I was wondering whether this can be done via a function that puts the focus
back to where it was before the click.

I'm having a problem getting fvwm to configure. Every time I get to
(what appears to be) the bottom of the script, I get:

checking whether setvbuf arguments are reversed... configure: error:
cannot run test program while cross compiling

Any help would be appreciated.

configure tool (for which autoconf is responsible, not fvwm) tends to
resume that you have a cross compiler instead of probably more correct
explanation that your C++ kit is not setup propertly, and fails the test.

Please add --without-cpp option to configure script and see if this helps.
This turns off compiling of one module in 2.2, which uses C++.

We're already thinking about that feature, but have not
decided if we want to implement it or not.  Although you
might think that after TitleAtBottom/Top was implemented
...Left/Right would only be minor changes, a corresponding
patch would be *very* much work.  I don't think we'll find
the time to implement this in the next half year.

Hi,

I would like to create a window with XCreateWindow without
decorations (no titlebar and frame) using fvwm. I tried the
Motif and KDE hints for this behaviour, but fvwm does not
seem to recognize them.
Is there a way do achieve this ?

Thanks.

Dirk
