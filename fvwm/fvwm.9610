Here's what I have in .fvwm2rc, and it's been working just fine for
quite a while now.  Still works fine with 2.0.43.

Key m           A       3       WindowList

I hit Alt-m, then move around with j and k or CursorUp and CursorDown,
then select a window with Space or Return.  Note: you might need to
hit a key twice for it to take effect.  Especially if you select
windows using the given number.

hth,

Hi all,

there's a behavior of the built-in WindowList that annoys be a little
bit, as I like to move my hands as little as possible.  Here's the
story:

The WindowList offers several possibilities to choose a window.  Among
them:

  - Type a digit or a letter to select a specific window (1, 2, ...,
    9, A, B, ...).
  - Use the J and K keys to move around and select the current window
    with Return or Space.

This is fine if you don't have too many windows, but there comes a
time when I hit J and it's not doing what I expect: it selects the
window marked with J rather than moving down one window.

I think one way out would be to require the user to use upper case
letters when choosing windows directly.  Or omit the letters J and K
(and N and P and maybe others) from the enumeration?  I'm not sure
what would be the best way.  Any suggestions?

tia,
kai

Good morning,

thanks to the new SendToModule command and some GREAT support added to
FvwmIconMan, I can have the function I most sorely missed from *twm: I
can now move up and down in the icon manager with the keyboard.
Here's what I have in my .fvwm2rc file (snarfed right out of the man
page for FvwmIconMan, modified slightly):

Key j A	3 SendToModule FvwmIconMan sendcommand focus focus + 1 Focus
Key k A	3 SendToModule FvwmIconMan sendcommand focus focus - 1 Focus

I'm a nasty boy now: I'm still not quite satisfied.  When I hit, say,
Alt-j, the window below the current window in the icon manager is
given focus.  The *twm icon managers allowed me to define one key to
move among the windows and another to specify one.  (Move the
selection up and down the icon manager -- WITHOUT any window being
raised or deiconified or anything -- and then hit a special key to
deiconify, raise and warp to the window currently pointed to.)

Is there anything I can do to achieve the same behavior with
FvwmIconMan?

Thanks a lot for this feature as it is, though, it's great!

Known problem that was discussed here a few weeks ago (it focuses, but
no longer warps).  The builtin window list will be fixed in the next
beta.

For what it's worth, I have never had a problem with that key sequence

override it (although I must admit that I've never tried to).

As you know, there are three ways you can specify a button: abolutely
(like button 4), relative to the focused button, or relative to the
selected button. In the current state of things, when the cursor is
outside of the manager window, there is no selected button, so 
you can't use that in your SendToModule command, and that's what you
(and I) would like to be able to do. I left that ouy cause I couldn't
decide which would be better: to remember what the last selected button
was, and use that if none is selected, or start at someweel known place, 
like button 0. 

The other problem with using the focus button for this is that you can't
give the focus to an iconified window, so any iconified window will
act as a barrier. 

I'm probably going to switch to using the syntax that the Next and Prev
commands use, but I still haven't figured out an elegant way to handle
the complications of: specifying the "current" button from which the
command is relative, and specifying the manager as well as the window.

As to the second one, FvwmIconMan is basically a two dimensional window
list, so the simple syntax that Next uses isn't quite sufficient.

So, since you're a consumer, what kinda of behaviour and syntax would 
you like?

Once in a while I see these error messages on my console window:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: 
/usr/local/lib/fvwm2/
Permission denied

This is not always reproducable by doing the same thing that happened to 
cause the error message (refresh screen for example). Some beta-bug or a 
misconfiguration error?

Version is fvwm 2.043, running on HPUX 9.03.

when will v2.1 go production?  your web page says "real soon now" but
there is no date info on the web page (as to when "reas soon" is or as
to when the statement "real soon now" was made) so there's no way for me
to tell if that statement has been there for 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months,
or 5 years.

Forgive me if this is a faq (or at least direct me to the faq), but is
there a .fvwm2rc setting or a patch that allows a window to be raised
whenever a click occurs anywhere within the client area? I just noticed
that fvwm-95 does this, and I was wondering if the ability was part of
fvwm2 that I've missed...

That's a "feature" of both fvwm-[12] and fvwm95 that works _only_ if you
specify ClickToFocus :-(   Since fvwm-95 has ClickToFocus in its default
fvwmrc file, you experience this behaviour.

This topic has been discussed several times on this list, though no none
could explain to me yet why it has to be like this, and why there's no
way to, say, let the user set a ClientClickRaise flag for all xterm-like
windows.

I think I don't really want to start from the button that has last
been selected.  Here's what I want:

  - Simple case: There is a window that has focus and it is displayed
    in IconMan.  In this case, start moving relative to the button
    corresponding to the window that currently has focus.
  - Complicated case: No window has the focus or the window that has
    focus isn't displayed in IconMan.  In this case, the best thing
    would be, I guess, to remember which of the windows displayed in
    FvwmIconMan last had focus and to start moving relative to that.

I think this is a rather intuitive behavior, especially for the
"simple" case.  For the complex case, one could imagine a different
behavior: pretend the window that currently has focus were inserted
into the IconMan and start moving relative to that position (which is
between two buttons, of course).  For an alphabetically sorted list,
this could conceivably be what someone wants, but I find it strange.

  Brady> The other problem with using the focus button for this is
  Brady> that you can't give the focus to an iconified window, so any
  Brady> iconified window will act as a barrier.

I didn't want to move the focus, I wanted to move the selection and
have a key that focuses the selected window.  To clarify: suppose the
button corresponding to the window that currently has focus is red;
suppose the selected button is green.  Suppose further that the
IconMan contains buttons for windows A to E in that order, and that C
is red (ie has focus).  Suppose I hit CursorUp, then I want the red
button to disappear, and I want B to be green.  Then hitting
CursorDown should move the green to C, then to D.  Then hitting Return
should focus D so that D becomes red.  See?

  Brady> I'm probably going to switch to using the syntax that the

  Brady> an elegant way to handle the complications of: specifying the
  Brady> "current" button from which the command is relative, and
  Brady> specifying the manager as well as the window.

I have no strong feelings about the syntax.  Choose whichever syntax
you like.  As long as there is an example in the man page that shows
me how to get what I want, I'm happy :-)

Did I explain clearly enough so that you can understand what I'm
trying to say?  What do you think about my suggestion?  Can this be
implemented?

regards,
kai

At the risk of sounding sarcastic, that is the point of that
statement.  The current beta versions are pretty stable for everyday
use, but there is still work to be done before I feel that it's ready
for "mass consumption".

So it's close and could theoretically be ready at any time, but since
work happens in my rather limited (almost mythical) "free time" I
don't know how long any given amount of work on fvwm will take.

My current rough timetable is to get one more beta (2.0.44) out within
the next few weeks, and then 2.1.0 out within a week or two after that.

But then, that is what I said before 2.0.43 came out...  Things may
change again, but I'm going to try real hard to prevent that.

Hi,

  I've been using fvwm 2.0.43 for a little while now, having switched from
fvwm1.xx.  One of the things I noticed when I switched over was that
transient windows (such as netscape's find window, or gimp action
windows) don't have a border anymore.  I've been able to get a Titlebar
with "Style "*" DecorateTransient", but I would really like to go back to
having transients have a border, with no title bar.  Is this possible
anymore?  

Thanks in advance,

Jay

Hi everyone,

I just subscribed to this list, so I don't know if this is
or has been a thread already...

I'm running fvwm-2.0.42 on NetBSD-1.1 (i386) and XFree86-3.1.2.
While hacking my ~/.fvwm2rc, I discovered that fvwm2 is pretty picky
about how the ColormapFocus is to be set. It turned out that
either exactly ONE space or exactly ONE tab must be used between
ColormapFocus and FollowsFocus or FollowsMouse. Otherwise, the code
in fvwm/builtins.c (procedure SetColormapFocus) doesn't find
either keyword. I'll dive into the code once I know this really
is a bug, and hasn't been fixed in the meantime.
This version of fvwm compiled right out of the box here, with
only four warnings about uncast pointer-integer assigments
in modules/FvwmForm/FvwmForm.c (all 'GetFontOrFixed' calls).

Great window manager, by the way; must be running it for over
2 years now.

Jan

Hi all,
  I use fvwm2 2.0.42a (but i tried 2.0.43 also), and there is something
anoying: (it deals with colormaps)
  I use softwindows on my alphastation, softwindows's window is composed
with a menu bar, the PC screen, and a status bar:
+-----------------------+
+ File Option Action    +
+-----------------------+
|                       |
|                       |
|   PC screen emulation |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
+-----------------------+
+ Status bar            +
+-----------------------+
As the PC screen uses 256 colors, the "PC screen emulation" sub-window
uses its own Color map that.
Menu and status bar use standard root window colormap which is not the
"PC screen emulation" sub-window one.
Here comes the problem:
When the mouse pointer enters softwindows's window, the is a flash
showing there is something happening with colormaps, but a the end
nothing changed and  "PC screen emulation" colors are bad.
I manage to have the right colors with a hack: i click in a softwindows
menu, and then in the "PC screen emulation" window: i get the right
colormap.
I used softwindows with mwm, and it works fine (i get the right colors).
If the non-standard colormap is in the application main window, it seems
to work (for instance with: 'netscape -install').

So if this could be fixed in a further revision, i would be happy,

thanks,
	Laurent

I know, I was just rambling and giving yet another reason why you don't
want to move the focus.

It can be implemented rather easily, but I'm not sure when I'll have the time
to do it.

It's a bug.  I forgot to strip leading whitespace out of there.  It
should be fixed in the next beta (2.0.44), along with other fixes to
the parsing code.

        Hi there! I was wondering if it could be possible to have different
colors within the menu in FVWM such as green for net apps and red for games
and so on... I am referring to font color and background color within the=
 menu.

        thanks in advance ;-)

I think I got this from comp.lang.fortran:

Another one of mine... :-)

At least I think it is. I sent it to the Debian developer's list
on 18 June 1996, and didn't credit anyone for it. I usually do,
when I quote something.

No problems with copying, with or without attribution. It's not
big or important enough to worry about. But now that I've been
reminded about it, I'll put it on my web page.

Hmm, if people like it enough to quote it, perhaps I should try
to send it to rec.humor.funny? At least it would be more on-topic
than here.

There's a look missing somewhere there, I'm sure.

Why "another"? Have you written some other nice things like this one?
Hummm... I think it's time to visit Lars' page... :-)

Now, I'm pretty sure I got this from a message Lars Wirzenius sent to
the Debian GNU Linux Development mailing list on June 18, 1996.

Sorry Lars, I just saved the message as text (no headers) and forgot
to write where I got it from.

Cheers, Emilio.

As it says in the docs, if you want to compile with Xpm support, make
sure you have the Xpm lib available on your system.  If it's not
there, download it and compile it.  If it is there, modify the build
process to specify where it is located.

Hi,

the color of my desktop is plain black. When I resize a window,
the usual resizing grid appears, but it is black. Same when moving
a window around on my desktop. As this is black on black, i cannot
see, where exactly I am going to place the window. It would be
nice, if the resizing/moving grid would be drawn with XOR so that
the grid would be seen on top of any color.

Comments?

Actually, I've been meaning to ask a similar question:
My background is also mostly black.... after running fvwm 2.0.41 for 
several hours/days, the grid starts showing up as a different color.

Um... it IS drawn with XOR.  You may have to play with XORValue.  From
the man page:

          XORvalue number
               Changes the value with which bits are XOR'ed when doing
               rubber-band window moving or resizing.  Setting this
               value is a trial-and-error process.

Try 1 (which I use with a black background), then 255 (the default
actually), as I think these are the best bets (unless you have a
TrueColor/DirectColor visual @ 24 bpp, in which case try 250, which
worked for someone I know).

I decided to change the default to 1 (which I was setting in my
..fvwm2rc anyways) since it does seem to work better for darker
backgrounds.  That'll be in the next beta.

Thanx! seems that I should have read the manual more carefully.
A couple of days ago I had a problem with fvwm and all the modules
being started twice on my machine. I poked around a little bit
to find, that the Xserver offered two screens, a bw one and a colored
one. The Xsun server does this by default and looking at the fvwm src, I
saw that fvwm and forked itself to serve each screen. But I also found
that this was only done, it the -s option was not given. Thus, I didn't
send in a bug report, but use fvwm -s now :-) It seems that I tried
mailing first and then thinking, which is a bad idea :-)

Thanx,

P.S.: Sorry, for the babbling, but I just wanted to explain that I am

Hello Chuck and fellow list-readers,

I was just glancing at a magazine on my desk when I noticed that
the display on the obligatory computer screen appeared to have
been faked. (Computer Shopper, issue 104, Oct '96).
Somebody had taken a few images and pasted them onto a blue 
background to make a composite screen shot. The interesting bit
is that instead of the usual window manager borders and handles,
the artist had dropped in graduated shadows on the bottom and
right hand edges, giving the windows that "floating" appearance.

A quick comparison of the fake screenshot and my real screen
suggests that this effect would look really great if we could
do it for real. Does anyone have some thoughts on how practical
it would be to implement this?

Regards,
James.

Thanx! I chose 1 and it worked fine.
What is the actual problem with the XORValue? Why is it trial-and-error
process? Is it because you cannot acutally choose a color value, but
have to choose a color with a number?
If I have a color value of e.g. black: 00 00 00. If I xor this
with FF FF FF, I get FF FF FF. Thus I would always get the 'reverse'
color.
But on non true color systems I probably have colormap entry
black is e.g. 2, and 2 xor 255 yields 253, which might also contain
a very dark color, maybe the same as black. Is that the problem?

Another "similar" illusion is to take a texture background like marble and
use xv to blur it a bit.  This creates a depth-of-field which tends to
make the windows appear to be floating.  It's sort of like when you see a
picture of a flower that is in very clear focus, but the background
foliage is blured. 

Your mileage may vary...

PS.  In case you're interested.  The photographic effect is achieved by
setting your camera's lens aperture to a very wide opening and reducing
shutter speed.  (off topic, sorry...)

I believe that the rubberbands (grid) changes color during your X session
because most of the colors you see are the result of just dipping into the
default colormap and grabbing whatever color happens to be there.
(Someone correct me if FVWM doesn't work this way).  So, as X applications
change the default colormap, the rubberband colors change.  (This may be
only applicable to PseudoColor displays--i.e. displays that have a limited
colormap, often 256 colors.)

The XOR operations are occuring on colormap INDEXES not RGB values.  The
screen is layed out in rows and columns of pixel values which are NOT RGB
values.  The pixel values refer to cells in the colormap.  These cells
contain the RGB value of a pixel and these RGB values of cells are under
control of whatever applications happen to be running.

As the rubberbands are drawn, each pixel value is XOR'd with the XOR value
and the result of the XOR is put in place of the old pixel value.  The new
pixel value refers to some color in the colormap index.  But, FVWM doesn't
change the entire colormap so that the result of the XOR is a predictable
color (doing so would be a bad idea).  So, drawing the rubberband is
basically the same as drawing a line of random colors from the colormap.
You see different colors in the rubberbands because the colors in the
colormap change.

It's easy to setup an XOR value the results in a certain pixel value when
applied to a certain pixel value.  E.g. you can set up the XOR value to
always change white pixels to black pixels and vice-versa.  To do that,
you look up the pixel values for white and black and compute the XOR value
(actually, I think you simply XOR the two pixel values together to get the
right XOR value).  But doing that, you still don't know what color will
result when XOR'ing the XOR value with some other pixel value on the screen.

I think that on a lot of displays, the first two cells in the colormap
are black and white.  That's why the XOR value of 1 works well when you
have a lot black pixels in your root window.  I.e. the XOR operations
look like this (on an 8-bit display):

  draw rubberband:   00000000 XOR 00000001 = 00000001 (black)
  remove rubberband: 00000001 XOR 00000001 = 00000000 (back to white)

It kinda depends on the detail of shadowing; but you can find these
"effects" in the XForms library (at least with the programs I've used)
and the Taskbar for fvwm95.

It would seem that adding shadowing effects could be utilized with 
transparent xpms, that allow the texture below to show through. But a 
real shadowed effect would require that the depth of shadow extend down 
depending on how the windows are layered..a window that overlaps 3 other 
windows would have a larger shadow on the root window, but a shorter 
shadow on each window below it, but of course, that's nitpicking. I think 
its would be a neat effect.

ack..does that look like three layered windows with progressively deeper

ObPraise: fvwm2 is simply amazing, especially with Andrew Veliath's
titlebar patches (wow). No longer will anyone's desktop look like just
another desktop, but totally amd uniquely configured. But I'm digressing..

I havent seen any comments regarding using color_xterm.
I installed fvwm 2.0.42 and have had random problems with color_xterms.
It seems very strange.  Basically, color_xterms usually dont come up
when it execute one, and when they do, I can make them crash easily.

Is this problem known?  I thought I'd ask before sending all the
information.

I have been using fvwm 2.0.42 since mid-July. I have experienced no problems
with color_xterm (well, it doesn't like it when I resize; clear takes care of
it though).

Sorry to hear that you are having problems

I remember an ancient X program that would draw shadows on the root window just
like this.  It used a stipple of black dots to darken the root window below
application windows.  It used the stacking order to increase the depth of shadow
for the top windows.  It did not draw shadows on top of other windows, just the
root window so the effect wasn't perfect.  This could be done with a module
(if anyone wants to volunteer!), I don't think there's any reason to put
it in fvwm itself.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

Ditto ... no WM related problems with color_xterm on fvwm-2.0.4[23],
Irix 6.2.

There seems to be a bug in color_xterm's handling of the default
SouthWest gravity. I bypassed it by changing to NorthWest using the
resource:
	XTerm*resizeGravity: NorthWest

Subject: FVWM: Strange behaviour of IconBox when searching Icons
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

Hi,

I've recently compiled 2.0.43 whithout major problems under Solaris
2.4. In Fvwm.tmpl I set the FvwmIconPath variable to point to the
bitmaps and pixmaps - directory of our X11 - Distribution as well as
to the location of the Icons that come with Fvwm.
In my ".fvwmrc" (which is the proper file, I didn't rename fvwm) I
first set neither PixmapPath nor IconPath.

When I then started fvwm (starting the IconBox-module in the
InitFunction) it found the Icons it should - fine.

Then I set the PixmapPath variable in my .fvwmrc to point to
"/home/trampler/lib/Icons/", where I store some of my favourites,
logged off and back in again. Now FvwmButtons found all Icons (the
ones in the compiled-in directories as well as those in /home...)
while IconBox appeared to have forgotten about the compiled-in values,
i.e. it didn't show an icon for my xterms (xterm-sol.xpm from the
fvwm-Distribution) but knew about the icons in /home...

This means that to use IconBox I have to add the value of FvwmIconPath,
given at compile time, to the PixmapPath. This is no major problem,
but IconBox's behaviour is a bit strange.

Btw, is there a need for two variables to hold locations of Icons
(PixmapPath and IconPath) ? As I understand it, it was meant to
seperate xbms from xpms, but as far as I see they can be mixed in
directories and fvwm doesn't bother.

Cheers

I had done this form of shadowing in a DOS text-mode library I wrote in the
late 80's. Each window had a "level" attribute, which determined how "high" 
above the desktop it was. Watching the window's shadow vary its height as
you dragged it across the screen was a very, very neat effect.

Hello All,

I'm new to the wonderful world of fvwm, after many years using ctwm.
I was tempted to try fvwm when I couldn't figure out a way to move the
cursor around without having to use the mouse. Fvwm's CursorMove gave
me a very easy way to do what I wanted.

At least, until I upgraded to fvwm2 (via the RedHat Linux package
management system). Anyway, the upshot is, my CursorMove commands
still work, *except* when the mouse pointer is in root window,
when they have no effect. The relevant bit of my .fvwm2rc is:

	# press arrow + control anywhere, move the pointer by 1% of a page
	Key Left	A	C	CursorMove -2 0
	Key Right	A	C	CursorMove +2 +0
	Key Up		A	C	CursorMove +0   -2
	Key Down	A	C	CursorMove +0   +2

	# press arrow + shift anywhere, move the pointer by 1% of a page
	Key Left	A	S	CursorMove -20 0
	Key Right	A	S	CursorMove +20 +0
	Key Up		A	S	CursorMove +0   -20
	Key Down	A	S	CursorMove +0   +20

Am I doing something daft? I'd appreciate any ideas you folks might have.
Also, apologies if this is a FAQ. I have checked the mailing list
archives, but didn't come across anything that sounded like this
problem, but if I've missed something, I'm sorry.

All the best.

There was an amiga program which did draw shadows on top of other windows
too, and you could calibrate the depth and darkness of the shadows.
The effect was really nice.

I use MouseFocus, and just tried SloppyFocus.  Looks like some things
are getting in the way, and I'll have to look at it more closely.  The
question is, should SloppyFocus force the old window to retain focus
even when the cursor crosses a screen boundary?  I'm not sure and I
don't like SloppyFocus much.  I'd be interesting to hear what other
multi-headed users think, then I can try to debug the 2-screen
situation (although Mark or others will have to help with #screens >
2).

Hello,

and sorry to join this list with a rather long question.

I've been using FVWM as distributed w/Linux for many years (and love it).  
I think this may be the first time I've tried to build it.  I'm playing 
with the new tkgoodstuff and needed fvwm2.  I downloaded fvwm-2.0.43.tar.gz 
from ftp.hpc.uh.edu:pub/fvwm/version-2/ and unpacked it but failed to build
it 

   ... it may be a rather trivial problem, but if anyone can offer any
advice on what I should be looking for, I'd be very grateful:

On Linux 2.0.2 kernel,
Slackware distribution probably based on 1.2.13,
GNU Make version 3.74 
gcc version 2.7.0

... Following the instructions in INSTALL:

First, I didn't see anything obvious that needed changing in configure.h 
and Fvwm.tmpl ...

hp1et:/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43$ xmkmf
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config

hp1et:/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43$ make Makefiles

make[1]: Nothing to be done for `Makefiles'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43/libs'
# ... etc.  Same for all subdirectories, then ...

hp1et:/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43$ make
making all in ./libs...
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43/libs'

# FvwmAuto:  *** No rule to make target `FvwmAuto.o', needed by `FvwmAuto'.  Stop.

I won't bore you with the rest, but basically nothing much compiled!  
Have I missed a step here?  I read the success messages in the mailing list 
archives, so I know it can be done!

Thanks

Hmm, by accident I had to look a little deeper into this. In my setup
DESTDIR is empty. The rest of the variables are defined like this

          MANPATH = /tools/X11R6/man
    MANSOURCEPATH = $(MANPATH)/man
           MANDIR = $(MANSOURCEPATH)$(MANSUFFIX)


And later on in the fvwm-specific section, MANPATH is overridden.

        MANPATH = /my/home/fvwm-2.0.43/man

which I specified in the Fvwm.tmpl.

And even later you find this:

install.man:: fvwm2.man
        @if [ -d $(DESTDIR)$(MANDIR) ]; then set +x; \
        else (set -x; $(MKDIRHIER) $(DESTDIR)$(MANDIR)); fi
        $(INSTALL) $(INSTALLFLAGS) $(INSTMANFLAGS) fvwm2.man
$(DESTDIR)$(MANDIR)
/fvwm2.$(MANSUFFIX)

As DESTDIR is empty, it installes it exactly where I wanted.
This is X11R6.

Hmm, I cannot really say this, as I don't know enough of it. I just know
how it works
at our site with R6.

No answer to this one, too. I don't know if it is legal to rely on the
above setup,
which happens to be at our site. All I can say, it works for me and
probably for others :-)
Maybe the R4 imake setup was different and doesn't work with current
fvwm?

I think it uses MANPATH, because it wants to preserve a specific
directory structure
within the MANPATH, but I might be wrong.

Any Imake.conf setup gurus around to give us a definite answer? Should
we switch
to autoconf? :-)

I use SloppyFocus and prefer having a window retain focus even if I
accidentally wiggle the mouse onto te other display.

I'd like an enhancement to the RandomPlacement code, where under no
circumstances will a window be placed so it overlaps a StaysOnTop window
(unless there's no choice).

I'm using RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement.  My buttonbar is at the
top of my screen, and if SmartPlacement can't place something
RandomPlacement quite often puts it near 0,0 so that the top of the
window (including the title bar I need to move it) is hidden by the
button bar.

Anyone got something like that?  Seems like if SmartPlacement can make a
distinction between "used" and "free" screen space, it shouldn't be too
hard to make an in-between state of "hidden" screen space, or something,
and avoid that if possible.

Hi,
I have compiled successfully ddd. It is a graphical interface to the

I also use ddd, but I'm afraid I have no such problems.  What version of
Fvwm are you using?  What operating system?  Can you show us some sample
code from youe .fvwmrc (.fvwm2rc) file that may be of use?

I use ddd-2.0beta1 (haven't had time to grab the new source) under Linux
kernel 2.0.21, X11R6.1, and fvwm2-2.0.43.

Help Help!

Is there a way to move a window left/right/up/down from a function?  The move
function moves to absolute coordinates.  I've tried

AddToFunc MoveUp
+ "I" Move
+ "I" CursorMove 0p -442p

But all that happens is the cursor moves and leaves the window behind.  I also
tried using "C" instead of "I" in all 4 combinations with no luck.

Also I think I need a move function that affects only one of the x or y
positions so I can slam windows against the left/right margins without moving
them up or down.

Ta for any pointers,
Tim Phipps.

Hi,

Under FVMW v1.x I could use AutoRaise and SloppyFocus to
achieve something which I found quite useful.

Most of the time, I required the focused window to be
topmost (easy enough - keep the mouse pointer in the window
until it auto raised). Sometimes though, especially when
copying things between windows, I needed to keep the focused
window stacked *lower* than the other window. (see figure) 

In order to achieve this, I used to move the mouse pointer
into and then straight out of the other window, thereby
gaining focus, but not auto-raising the window.



  X  <- mouse pointer outside all windows

    +==============+
    |$ cat > file  | <- window with focus, but lower (data now
    |copied info.. |    visible in other window)
    |^D       +--------------+
    |$        | info..       |  <- Window with data (still
    |         | info..       |     on top)
    |         | info..       |
    +---------| info..       |
              +--------------+

So far so good. Unfortunately, I can't seem to replicate
this within FVWM2. I've tried FvwmAuto and SloppyFocus
together, but even when the mouse pointer is out of the
window, the window autoraises after the required time.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Regards,
        Jason.

PS. I hope this makes sense.. Please let me know if either
copies of my configs are required, or I haven't made myself
clear.

Does anyone here know of repositories for mini-icons (other than those
that come with FVWM)?

I'm not even necessarily looking for mini-icons, as much as small
icons... esp. height-wise.  E.g., I have a little xterm pixmap that's
29x23 and that's very close to perfect size... could be a little taller
but not much.

This is more for button bars than for menu or frame buttons: I don't
want my button bar to be too tall (wide is OK, since I use a horizontal
bar :) and I want to stack two buttons on top of each other.

I have the AIcons package, but don't see much smaller than 32x32 in that.

Alternatively (or in addition :), does anyone have a reasonably reliable
way of shrinking xpms, without too much distortion?  Seems unlikely, but
you never know :)

[This doesn't work with FvwmAuto because it raises based on Focus
rather than where the mouse is]

> Any suggestions?

I found this annoying also, except in revers.  I normally hate
AutoRaise, but there are times I want it.  In one of my menus I have
two items, one for turing FvwmAuto on, the other off.  It looks
something like this:

* "&AutoRaise On" Module FvwmAuto 500
* "AutoRaise &Off" KillModule FvwmAuto

This is certainly not exactly what you want, but it will work in a
pinch.

The fvwm95 distribution has a fair set of them:
http://ltiwww.epfl.ch/~barth/fvwm95.html

They're in the big tar file with everything else.

The only way I know of to shrink XPM's is to use XV or ImageMagick to shrink
them, and then go in with xpaint to patch things up. Depending on what the
xpm is, and how you shrink it, you might explode the number of colors as a
result of whatever smoothing process occurs. You can use ppmquant to quantize
a ppm file, and the ImageMagick tools can do that as well.

I personally either just draw mine myself (good for ugly pixmaps, boo hoo), or
shrink a nice one, and then use that as a guide to draw a cleaner one.

I had exactly the same problem, (with an other application though)
untill I discovered that I had the BorderWidth set to 0...

this did the trick for me,
< Style "Fvwm*" NoHandles,BorderWidth 0,NoTitle,WindowListSkip,Sticky
---
> Style "Fvwm*" NoHandles,BorderWidth 11,NoTitle,WindowListSkip,Sticky

Especially, if you are using dotfile, dotfile will set various
BorderWidths to 0 by default, I think the NoHandles ones.
You have to enable them in the menus explicitly.

Style * is not enough, you also need Style Fvwm*

Thanks Guenther,

Okay, I think I found it.

there is a window manager hint InputHint that needs to be true for
fvwm to autoraise (and give it focus, I think).  In the program I was
running it was set to false, for some unknown reason.  Here is some
sample code from the display initialization code:

	if((p_XWMH = XAllocWMHints()) == NULL){
		fprintf(stderr,"Error allocating Window Manager hints!\n");
		exit(1);
		}

	p_XWMH->flags = (InputHint | StateHint | IconPixmapHint);
	p_XWMH->input = True;

In the xlib Programming Manual (O'Reilly) this is even documented on
page 414:
	If your application requires keyboard input and you neglect to
	set the input flag to True, you [sic] application will not get
	keyboard events under some window managers, such as olwm.

Actually, I have found that olwm does not have this problem any
longer, but fvwm 1.24 does.

Is this a bug?  I dunno.  I know that there are clients out there that
don't set the input flag to be true and I would like to autoraise
them.

Hi:

I am using fvwm2 (fvwm95-2.0.42a) on SunOS 4.1.3.  In my current set-up, when
I click on an iconized window, it will de-iconize, set-focus-to-itself and warp
the cursor to the left-top [0,0]-pixel of the window.  This is nice, since I 
use virtual desktop, it directly takes me to the right desktop with the focus 
to the window I want etc. 

The problem though is the cursor is warped to 0,0 of that window.  So, each 
time I de-iconize a window 
 1. I have to lift to mouse to move it so I dont cross the mouse pad etc. 
 2. It seems to unfriendly, since even after 3 months of trying to get used to
    this, I always try to move the pointer from the icon to the window having
    forgotten it did it for me.  This is more so in my case as I use two screen
    wrapped around display, the pointer invariably gets lost.

I tried changing settings so it would not warp, but then I had to look at each 
desktop to look for the window I just de-iconized.

Thanks,

Prasad

Wile I'm on the subject of autoraise, twm (and variants) have per
window autoraise.  You can dynamically toggle autoraise on a window as
well as have a default behavior.  

I would really love this.  Sometimes there is a window that I really
don't want to autoraise, but usually I want to.  Is there any way to
do this with fvwm?

Thanks,

Sorry to say I haven't been following  this discussion very carefully,
but if the problem centers around input hints, try the Lenience flag.

Hello again, 

Just to let you all know I'm not giving up on building fvwm2 on linux 
2.0.2 just yet ... Thanks to those who responded to my earlier message.

I think the problems are with my Linux configuration and not with fvwm, 
but here's what I found out ...

First off, use 'xmkmf -a' to make Makefiles and compile dependencies 
in one step.  My version of make was not looking for Makefile for some 
reason (renaming to makefile worked) -- don't know if this was a problem 
with GNU make 3.74 or some variable that make uses?-- I upgraded to 3.75 
and that finds Makefiles fine.

fvwm2 still does not build completely due to an undeclared reference to 
__FDSET_INTS.  /usr/include/linux/posix_types.h does not declare this, 
even though it is used in the FD_ZERO macro (asm/posix_types.h) which 
fvwm seems to use quite a lot.  I'm not sure what to do about this, as 
I don't want to end up with a hack.  Any suggestions welcome! 

Regards 
 Andy Pearce    ajp@hpopd.pwd.hp.com

------------

eg; fvwm/event.c
  FD_ZERO(&out_fdset);

/usr/include/asm/posix_types.h:
#define __FD_ZERO(fdsetp) \
                __asm__ __volatile__("cld ; rep ; stosl" \
                        :"=m" (*(__kernel_fd_set *) (fdsetp)) \
                        :"a" (0), "c" (__FDSET_INTS), \
                        "D" ((__kernel_fd_set *) (fdsetp)) :"cx","di")

/usr/include/linux/posix_types.h:
#undef __FDSET_LONGS
#define __FDSET_LONGS   (__FD_SETSIZE/__NFDBITS)


Eg, from the build output:

making all in ./fvwm...
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/fvwm-2.0.43/fvwm'

I don't really know if this will help but I have a few windows that I
rarely want focus to.  I have them styled with ClickToFocus.  On my 
machine, the combination of ClickToFocus and Autoraise have the desired 
effect -- all other windows are autoraised but the ones with ClickToFocus 
are ignored by autoraise.

I agree, but when this happens the window that has focus is no longer
highlighted.  Once the mouse moves to another screen the highlight
color is removed and isn't restored when the mouse is returned to that
window.

Hi,

I am new to using fvwm.  I'm quite pleased with it, except I find that
I want a function that does the following:

  if an xdvi window is visible, then switch to an emacs window (via
     'Next [Emacs] Focus', for instance)
  if an emacs window is visible, then switch to an xdvi window
  if neither is visible, switch to an emacs window

How can I write a function (or use an appropriate module) so I can
have a single key bound to this sort of thing?

You might give the emacs and the xdvi (if it exists) the same title,
and make sure they are the only ones with that particular title. Then,
if both exist, some key like

	Next [ <title> ] Focus

should give focus to whichever one of them doesn't currently have it.
If only the emacs exists, the key should always give that focus.

Hi,

Right, though I am at the moment using fvwm95 and the taskbar I *think*
this will be applicable to the buttonbar. Anyway...

what I want to do is to define a command so that:

double click on a button :  IF netscape mail is running deiconify it, if
iconified, raise and focus to it
ELSE load up netscape mail and focus to it.

I want this to be able to be bound to either a button in goodstuff (is
that right?, I can't remember) or the mail icon in the taskbar.


Okay thanks for your help,
Nick

This is a typical fvwm question... it's valid.  [smile]

 
> double click on a button :  IF netscape mail is running deiconify it, if

> ELSE load up netscape mail and focus to it.

I use the following extensively in my fvwmrc file:

AddToFunc	"warp-or-run"
+	"I"	Next [$0] Iconify -1
+	"I"	Next [$0] Focus
+	"I"	None [$0] $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

The first argument ($0) is the name of the window to search for.  The
next arguments (up to 9) are the 'Exec' command to run if the window
isn't found.

Using the new FvwmButons module, you can call it as such:

*FvwmButtons(Icon mini-filemgr.xpm, Action 'warp-or-run "moxfm*" Exec
moxfm')

I don't want to hardcode the paths that the system manager has used for
the modules into my .fvwm2rc file.  Yet I want to add a path for my
own modules.  At the moment, the ModulePath has to have both the system
path and the custom path.

suggestions for future versions:
(1) Modify the syntax of ModulePath (and perhaps other paths) to have a
    trailing ":" signify that the "standard" paths are to be appended.  (The
    TeX environment variable TEXINPUTS uses this convention and in addition
    uses the convention that a trailing // on a file name signifies that
    directories and all subdirectories).

    thus:
    ModulePath /home/me/Modules:
    signifies that I want fvwm2 to look in my directory and then in the
    standard Modules directory.

(2) As part of the standard installation, add a few extra Form modules (as
    links).  For example, add FvwmForm1, FvwmForm2, FvwmForm3 as aliases for
    FvwmForm.  This way, a user can set up different "forms" without having
    to have copies (or links) for the modules.  For instance, I use one form
    for a "query/exit X" command, another for "rlogin to remote".  My personal
    Modules directory contains only links to FvwmForm, with two different
    names.  If the standard directory had a few extra generic links, I would
    not have to have maintain my own modules directory.

2.0.43 has some option to say where the focus should go, I think.

(Focus 50 50 positions in middle of window, Focus 0 0 gives old
behavior.)

I really want per-window auto raise, tho.  I usually want only a
couple of windows to be autoraised.  Also, I would like autolower (the
window is lowered when it loses focus).  This way, I could position my
DVI previewer over all the little windows (xbiff, xload, xclock etc)
and turn on both autoraise and autolower.  Then, I move the mouse from
the editor into the DVI previewer, the previewer pops to the front, I
can look at it.  When I move back into the editor, the previewer plops
back to the background again, so that I can look at all the little
windows (want to see the time ;-).

I like this idea, but I can't figure out how to give xdvi a title.
"xdvi -title blah" doesn't work, there doesn't seem to be a "Title"
resource that I can attach to XDvi, etc.  I could call my emacs window
"Xdvi", but that violates my sense of aesthetics.  Do I have to make
this sacrifice, or is there an alternative?

Could all this stuff (per window autoraise/autolower) be done via a
module?  The module woul listen for window enter/leave events and then
direct fvwm to do the right thing.

I can't recall if window enter/leave events are available from fvwm.

  Subject: Weird 3.7.7 bug with fvwm window manager

  I tried ImageMagick 3.7.7 with FreeBSD, XFree86 3.11, eight-bit display.

  Here are (maybe) some rather bizzare bugs:

    1. display junk.gif
    2. iconize the window

  The image is now shrunk to about 90x90

    3. un-iconize the window

  The image window expands to its original size

    4. left button -- view -- original size

  The image window is suddenly shrunken to the size (I assume) that the
  image was when it was when iconized!  Another small "locator" window
  appears (containing a representation of the entire image) that allows
  one to move a small box about which then causes the original image
  window to show that portion of the image that is inside the small box.
  I couldn't find a way to enlarge the image window back to its original
  size without reloading the original image file.  Even then, any
  operation on the newly loaded image results in the same shrinking
  window.

  I noticed this because of another problem (which, I suppose, might not
  be a bug exactly): if one displays a gif and then clicks the left
  button, the menu window appears.  Both the menu window and the image
  window seem to use the same colormap.  Then, if one does, say, an
  EMBOSS operation, the color map gets remade, and sometimes the menu
  window becomes completly black when the pointer is in either the image
  window or the menu window.  This makes using the menu impossible.
  However, if one iconizes the image and brings it back, then the
  colormap used seems to allow both the image and the menu to be seen at
  the same time.  Of course, this triggers the first bug.  (I've since
  noticed that if the left button is clicked to remove the menu, and
  then clicked again to bring the menu back, then the menu is visible
  again)


  Hmmm... as I've been playing with display 3.7.7 to make sure that my
  description is accurate, it's getting weirder:

    1. display junk.gif
    2. left button -- effects -- emboss

  colormap changes, menu goes black, image -- briefly -- shows the
  result, then suddenly the image window shrinks to what appears to be
  the size when iconized...  I thought maybe I've got a goofy .displayrc
  or app-defaults/Display, but here they are:

  .displayrc:
    display.confirmExit:	False
    display.backdrop:	False
    display.usePixmap:	False
    display.colormap:	Private
    display.dither:	False
    display.gammaCorrect:	True

  app-defaults/Display:
    *.displayGamma:	4.0
    *.backdrop:	False
    *.dither:	True
    *.usePixmap:	False
    *.sharedMemory:	True

  An `xrdb -edit file' also showed nothing strange.

  I also just tried this with display 3.7.5 and got the same results.  I
  know I've done this before, and had no problems as long as I hadn't
  iconized the window.

  So, I killed the X server and started a new one.  The result: the
  image is not shrunk after an emboss using either 3.7.5 or 3.7.7
  display.  However, once I've iconized the image once, from that time
  on every emboss operation (and probably others, but I didn't try)
  shrinks the image window.  Aparently some switch is being set (inside
  the X server?  inside the window manager?) that triggers this bug for
  all subsequent invocations of display.

  So, next experiment: I restarted the window manager (fvwm).  The
  result: the image is not shrunk after an emboss using either 3.7.5 or
  3.7.7 display as long as I didn't iconize the window.  That means that
  display, after being iconized once, is somehow retrieving something
  from the window manager that causes it to shrink the image size to
  the iconized image size?

  So, next experiment: I tried the twm and gwm window managers.  The
  result: no shrinking.

  My conclusion: something is being remembered by the fvwm window
  manager after iconizing display's window.  This is somehow affecting
  all subsequent invocations of display and causing the images to be
  shrunken.  Very strange.  I've not had any other problems using this
  window manager with any other X application.  Wish I knew more about
  X, but I don't know what I'd be looking for from this point.

  Subject: Re:  Weird 3.7.7 bug with fvwm window manager

  You can help track the fvwm bug with -debug

    display -debug some.image

  Save off the output in a file.  Then try the exact same sequence with another
  window manager and produce a diff of the two.  This should help identify
  what the problem is.  More than likely, an extra configure notify is
  showing up when it not supposed too.  This could be a bug in either
  display or fvwm.  Perhaps fvwm should not be sending the extra configure
  event or perhaps display should be able to handle it more gracefully.  However,
  I suspect that the problem is with fvwm.

  The colormap problem sounds like it might be a window manager problem as
  well.  It's possible that the window manager is not installing the private
  colormap when focus is brought to the image window.  This problem does not
  occur on my 8-bit SUN workstation (or IBM, or SGI, or ...).

  Window managers are supposed to follow the ICCCM protocol.  It's possible
  that fvwm does not.  However, I do not know for sure if that's the case...

  Subject: -debug output for weird fvwm problem

  Here are the logs of my weird window manager problem.  As far as possible I
  tried to follow the exact same steps:

    start display
    position window (twm only; fvwm placed it for me)
    (mouse is outside of window)
    move mouse to iconize spot on title bar
    click (to iconize)
      wait for small image to appear in icon
    move mouse to icon
    click (to un-iconize)
    (mouse is on window title bar; twm only)
    move mouse into image window
    click left button
    move mouse to menu
    click left button effects
    click left button emboss
    (mouse is now outside of both windows)
      wait for fvwm instance to shrink window
    move mouse into image window
    click right button
    click left button quit
    click left button don't save

  I've matched up the lines in what appears to be the correct match...

  PS. I'm using v1.24 of fvwm; there is a beta version 2.0.43 available, so I
  built it and gave it a try.  I got the same behavior with display.
  If you determine that it's a bug with fvwm, I'll forward this report
  to the fvwm maintainers.

  Subject: Re:  -debug output for weird fvwm problem

  It's all coming back to me now...  I investigated this problem a couple of
  years ago.  I'm convinced the problem is with fvwm.  Fvwm is sending
  a suprious configure notify:

    Configure Notify: 0x2000011 96x93+0+0 0

  This notify does not occur unless you iconify first and it appears that the
  notify is the same size as the icon.  However, the icon window is a different
  ID than the image window.

  ImageMagick is just doing what it is told.  Fvwm says to resize yourself to
  96x93, so it does.  No other window manager (that I know of) sends this
  particular message.

If you like that, you might want to check out
http://www.zip.com.au/%7Ebb/XawXpm/
its a hack on libXaw.so
that lets you have pixmaps as backgrounds for you Athena-based apps.
Very cool.

They aren't, but focus/unfocus events are.  Please note that I
carefully talked about getting focus and losing focus rather than
window enter/leave :-)

OK, no one took up the gauntlet I threw to change RandomPlacement to not
place under StaysOnTop windows, so I have another question :)

I'm thinking I have to move my buttonbar to the bottom of my window,
since it's just too annoying to have the tops of windows hidden by it
when they appear.  That means I'll have to move my icons (I use one
Style "*" IconBox) to the top of the screen.

Can I modify the IconBox style so that the title of of the iconified
window appears _above_ the icon, rather than below?  This would give me
a bit more screen real estate at the top, and still allow me to see at
least the title of all my icons.

Hello,
	This one of those things that you can spend many cycles on and not
accomplish anything!  But I've been able to modify the doomarena.tcl
file (oh yea! Sparc 20, solaris 2.4, doomarena2.0, sorry) to come up
as an icon.  I don't know if it was the wrong way to do it, but down
inside doonarena.tcl I added the command: ``wm iconify .'' & it
worked.  But I want to have a button in the FvwmButtons that Swallows
the Doom Arena icon.  I have this:

*FvwmButtons( Swallow "Doom Arena" \
             `Exec /export/home/doom/doomarena/bin/doomarena_iconic & `)

But I get an Icon on the desktop.  When I click on the icon, it
expands but gets swallowed by the button!!  How can I swallow just the
icon??

Thanks

I'm new to the list today, but I'll jump in feet first anyway.

First, let me say I love fvwm.  Once I get a little more into the customization of it, it'll be perfect.

The major problem I have is:  I have a Sun Sparc with 2 heads.  I looked through the mailing list archives, but can only find vague references to running 2 monitors.

Can someone, publically or privately, advise me as to how to set up a dual-headed monster?

I am running 1.2x fvwm on Solaris 2.5.1.

Any help would be appreciated.

You don't need (or want) to swallow the icon.  What you want to do is
capture the icon, and create a "button" that will launch the
application.

There are two ways to do this:

1.  Find the sources, and look for the icon file.  Copy it to where fvwm
    looks for icons or pixmaps (as in Pixmappath), and use that file to
    represent the button to launch the application.

2.  Run the application and iconize it, and then "grab" the screen
    image with xv, convert it to an XPM file, put it into the pixmap
    directory, and use that file as the pixmap.

Then, set up a button to use the pixmap file you created, with an Action
to launch the program.

This is basically what I do to add applications to my button bar. 
However, I take the additional time to scale the pixmaps down to 14x16
or so (with mini icons, I can have a lot more apps on my button bar).

And yes... we could use a repository for mini-icons!  I've a few that I
could contribute if there was one.

Your X server (X11R6?) should manage all of your screens when it
starts.  If it doesn't you might have to use the -dev argument or the
XDEVICE environment variable.  fvwm obtains the number of screens from
the X server and then starts window managers on each of those screens.

If I remember correctly, fvwm 1.2x worked with on multiple screens
without any special configuration.

I did that, but with the doomarena, when it is iconified, the icon
changes when someone wants to play on the network!   Yea, I know,
should spend more time working, but when you got to spaz out for 15
minutes, I can't think of a better way!!

This not necessary since you can call FvwmForm with an arg. From the
man page:

INITIALIZATION
       FvwmForm uses the same configuration file (usually .fvwmrc
       in  the  user's  home directory) as Fvwm.  To use FvwmForm
       for multiple input forms,  simply  create  symbolic  links
       with  different names, and they will be treated as differ
       ent modules.  Or, you can invoke FvwmForm with an optional
       parameter,  which  it  will  use as the name instead (e.g.
       'Module FvwmForm QuitVerify').  That way  you  don't  even
       have to make a symbolic link for it!

Pretty nice, uh?

I had a go at a patch for this some time ago (about 6 months, I think).
I got most of the way there: the icon was drawn correctly, but placement
was a bit dodgy.

If you're interested I could try and resurrect the code.

Subject: FVWM: Normalize wanted
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2

Hello FVWMers,
	I've been playing with different title buttons that maximize to
different geometries.  Everything is working fine except that maximize is a
toggle action and there is no way to set a windows max/normal state except 
by toggling it.  

An example:

AddToFunc Tall
+ "I" Maximize 0p 886p
+ "I" Focus

will stretch a window from the top of the screen down to my button bar.  I
use it when I'm viewing long files.  If the file has long lines in it I
might want to switch to full screen.  If I boink the maximize button the
window goes back to normal size and I have to boink maximize again to get
full screen.  What I want is a way to get from one maximized size to another
without going through normal size.  There are several way I can think of
doing this but I'm not capable of changing the code so here's my thoughts:

1) Provide a Normalize function that does nothing to a normal sized window
   and unmaximizes a maximized window.  I would use this in a function thus:
   
      AddToFunc Tall
      + "I" Normalize
      + "I" Maximize 0p 886p
      + "I" Focus
      
   I know it would do two redraws but I could live with that.
   
2) Change the parameter to maximize to take negative values.  Positive values
   behave as at present i.e. Maximize is a toggle.  Negative values JFDI. eg
   
      AddToFunc Tall
      + "I" Maximize -0p -886p
      
   This is a bit dirty and could be difficult to code for corner cases e.g. 
      + "I" Maximize 100 -100
      
3) Provide a MaximizeDontToggle (or MaximizeAndIMeanIt or MaximizeDammit 8-)
   function that doesn't toggle.
   
4) Make "Maximize 0 0" behave like Normalize.  At 2.0.42 it behaves like
   "Maximize 100 100".
   
My vote is for Normalize since it might be useful in ways I have not thought
of yet and might be the easiest to implement.

Cheers,
Phippo.

Hi,

Can anybody tell me how expensive it would be to extend the FvwmPager module 
so that it displays miniatures of the real windows. This way if you are using 
your workstation primarily for diplaying pictures you would have a nice way to 
navigate on your virtual desktop.

If anybody has done or is working on this please let me know. Or maybe someone 
is willing to this if he gets some financial sponsorship?

Werner

There are a number of programs that already draw their own icons.

For pictures, the  "display" program in  the ImageMagick  package does
what you want.

The one I am most familiar with is XEmacs which includes the live-icon
package which  does a sketch  of the XEmacs   window.  Since XEmacs is
appoximating characters to     pixels, and ignoring title    bars  and
menubars  the logic is fairly simple.   However, if the window manager
attempted to draw the  icon, I think it  would fail miserably. When it
went to reduce a spot in the window containing a character to a pixel,
the  color in  the  background   would  overwhelm  the  color of   the
character.  So  when it tried to draw  a picture of the XEmacs window,
with all  its  glorious color,  all  you would see  is the background,
menubar, toolbar and status line.

> If anybody has done  or is working on  this please let me  know. Or

As I said, ImageMagick would be a place to start.

My guess is that money could buy anything.

I do not think, it would look _that_ bad. Of course, an application
knows a lot more about its data and is thus much better suited to
calculate the icon, but even without this knowledge it is possible to
come up with a generic algorithm that looks quite passable. Do a
couple of experiments with "xv" and you will see what I mean.

For instance, open a window of your prefered application and grab its
contents. Then calculate the size that this window will have in the
pager and shrink the grabbed image to this size. If you tell "xv" to
use dithering and to internally compute with true-color values, then
the resulting icon can be told apart from other icons. This will not
help in telling exactly what is displayed in the original window, but
it should give you a basic impression.

Also, an algorithm that wants to do this, could probably enhance the
image quality by using first and second derivatives of the color
gradients in order to detect edges. It would then have to use this
information in order to emphasize structures.

I see a couple of other problems, though:

 - this algorithm takes a lot of time. In order to not eat up all of
   the cpu resources, the process would have to artificially slow down
   and return cpu performance to the system. This means that updates
   do not happen very often.

 - in order to come up with good results it is essential to use lots
   of colors. While this is no problem in a true color environment, it
   could eat up valuable color entries in an 8bit environment. I
   imagine, that there would have to be some rather tricky code to use
   existing color entries. Maybe, the icons could be limited to
   grayscale entries. It might be able to get away with just a few
   discreet values.

 - I am uncertain, whether it would be possible to reflect changes in
   partially or totally obscured windows. Somebody else, who is more
   experienced with the X protocol, will have to provide this
   information.



Markus

P.S.: Sorry, I do not have the time to try implementing this
      algorithm. Even money wont convince me :-)

I think you've got an important point in here that scuppers any scheme to
have mini-windows in the pager.  Only the application and the X-server can
tell when the applications windows contents change.  In order to have
mini-windows the application window would have to be grabbed every few seconds.
I've seen programs that spy on other windows by grabbing at intervals, you can't
get any work done since the window keeps getting frozen when it is grabbed.

Perhaps you might consider a more abstract alternative.  The pager could find
out the application top level window background colour and use that in the
pager window.  If you colour code your windows it would give a better hint
and might look quite nice.  It would be a lot of work for the pager to query
every window that gets created but would be low on CPU load.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

I agree. In my case, the most common types of windows are of differing colors,
with the exception of netscape and xemacs. Also, I would want the window
frames to be drawn, so that the focused window can be highlighted without
changing the color of the entire window. 

It also probably would be possible to autodetect a certain set of windows
and draw them specially. Like put a fake toolbar and modeline on xemacs
windows, and a little scrollbars on xterms and xconsoles, etc. 

These seems better than the current setup but without the cost of full blown
shrinking and dithering.

<Clueless User Warning>

How about another X server, kind of like Xest, which would eavesdrop on the
stream of requests to the main X server, and display the same thing except with
automatic subsampling?

Since this nested piggy-back X server would run only at the same time as the
main X server (only faster, due to less data to display), the user should only
perceive the added work as an X server slowdown.  The slowdown would be a small
fraction of the normal latency of the main X server, ideally equal to the ratio 
of the resolution of the piggy-back server to that of the main server.

Could Xnest be mangled to perform such a piggy-back service?

I'm new to fvwm2 -- got it working and am now trying to configure it!

Am I right in thinking FvwmButtons module and tkgoodstuff provide 
essentially the same things, from a user interface viewpoint?  The 
advantage of tkgoodstuff being that you save on process resources 
because the tk/tcl clients are manifested via a single wish interpreter?
But if I want my taskbar to look like Win95 or CDE, I have to use 
FvwmButtons?

You write:
>Am I right in thinking FvwmButtons module and tkgoodstuff provide 
>essentially the same things, from a user interface viewpoint?  

Both provide button bars.  Tkgoodstuff has a lot of additional
features: completely GUI-configured with tabbed notebooks and
hierarchical list widgets, lots of built-in "clients", lots of
flexibility of button behavior (like buttons whose relief is sensitive
to the existence of windows with the specified name/class, rather than
to the existence of a process spawned by the button), etc..

No, that's backwards: the Win95 stuff (buttons for each X window;
GUI-configured menu) is done by tkgoodstuff (the tkgoodstuff
WindowList client) but NOT by FvwmButtons.  Fvwm95 has a module called
"FvwmTaskBar" that imitates some of the Win95 taskbar's look.  It may
well suit your needs.  But tkgoodstuff is far more flexible, IMHO.

It may be that you'd have to do a lot of "swallowing" to equal
tkgoodstuff's resource usage.  Another disadvantage of tkgoodstuff at
this point is that features have outpaced polish: there are a number
of bugs (few very dire), and the author is moving very slowly to
correct them (collaborators welcome!).

Tkgoodstuff is at:

Hey,

I am including a small patch for two problems related to FvwmM4.
First, the -m4-prefix is incompatible with the -m4-[es]quote.  Second,
the man pages are wrong when using -f to invoke FvwmM4, the correct
solution is to use -cmd.  Don't freak out, it's a tiny patch.

no, subsampling is a hell of a job, if it has to look like the original.

don't know, but mangling the X server isn't fvwm's job.
If the event stream doesn't carry the information, fvwm2 is left out in the
rain.

well we could of course hook onto the "redraw" event and do a grab
afterwards, hmmmm. I don't like the idea. Sounds like a CPU hog.

I can get the FvwmPager module to die fairly consistently by moving
an xterm from some other virtual desktop to the currently selected one
with middle-mouse.  The xterm shows up, the pager window vanishes, and
I get this error message in my xconsole:

X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)
  Serial number of failed request:  3025
  Current serial number in output stream:  3025

I'm not certain, but it only seems to happen with xterm.

very old parsing bug.
consistent use of GetNextToken or some such should root this out.

(it's a string consisting of just a tab or space which is thought to be a
command or module. Execution has to fail.)

it's the parsing code just skipping one character (any !!!)
and not using GetNextToken. (thus only one space is killed)

I had the same problem, because the X server from sun
creates to displays and fvwm forks of a copy for each
display. the option -s prevents this.
I didn't have any problems restarting fvwm, though. Maybe
this is another problem. Please test and report.

Well, I tried it several times myself
moved xterm to almost every workspace I had, and back to
the selected one. Nothing happened... Everything works fine here...

seems like different parsing strategies/no compiled in defaults for
IconBox.

I don't like compiled in paths, since you've got to recompile each tool, as
you reorganize directory trees, or change mountings.

system.fvwmrc should be the place for this info.

But at least it should be consistent.

(automatically adding prefixes & postfixes like

I don't like that idea, so it probably won't happen.  Using the full
file name which would be found in the stated paths is simple and
unconfusing.

What may happen, on the other hand, is to just use PixmapPath for both
(which basically already works, I believe) and just remove IconPath.

not now, when almost everything is working at last !!!

ok an answer at last, thanks, I thought I'd talked to a wall on this topic.

hmm, now since this was the only answer to the 3rd question on the topic,
I have to think, that the imake gurus have died out with the dinosaurs.

Could anybody please take the time to clear this up for now & ever?
(I simply don't know where to start. And it would take very long for me,
since I never tackled with differences between X11 releases before)

I don't get this error, but then, I wasn't able to compile the xterm that
came with X11R6.  I am using the one that came on the Solaris system I 
am using.

sorry style bits are on back order till 2001 ;^)

if you have my patches for 2.0.43 (or wait till 44 is out, it might include
some or all of them), it should be possible to say sth like 

FvwmAuto 300 "next [CirculateHit Windowid $w] raise"

well on second thought it might not work yet - no time to have a look,
but just try and mail me wether id does/doesn't work.

I'll try to have a look sometimes soon.

you have to use "Immediate" or "Motion" (after a timeout) for single click
buttons and "Click" for DoubleClick buttons, since FvwmButtons consumed the
first click before calling the function.

I have no problem with the current method, however, I would like to be
sure that the current path isn't limited in size.  Recently I tried to
break my plug-in hierarchy for the gimp down into several
sub-directories (I have well over 100 plug-ins) and then list all of the
directories in the path.  (Essentially what one would have to do if the
current method is maintained but wanted to organize things into
hierarchies.)

Well. . .to make a long story short, the gimp couldn't handle a path of
that length which could be a concern here.

Yes. . . this is a good idea.  I've encountered many situations where
users cannot figure out which path to use for what.  At one point I was
guilty of this.  One path would certainly eliminate a lot of confusion.

i've been busy and not really following the discussion here closely as
of late...my apologies if this has been nipped and i just happened to
miss it.  i remember this being brought up in the past, but was just
wondering what the status on it was...

the problem is that with fvwm 2.0.43 (and previous versions...), if fvwm
is not explicitly told to quit before the user logs out, it doesn't die
when the xsession dies.  i don't experience this problem, since i use
fvwm as my session manager, but there are a number of users that use my
installation of fvwm 2.0.43 on three different platforms (ultrix 4.3,
osf/1 3.2, and irix 5.3), and i am seeing more and more machines with
these runaway processes on them.  here is a sample from 'top' on one of
them:

IRIX du89-09 5.3 11091812 IP22 Load[2.16,2.28,2.30] 21:04:28   50 procs
    user   pid  pgrp   %cpu proc  pri  size   rss    time  command
    8225  4996  4980  48.97    *  100   674   204 4913:44  fvwm-2.0.43
    8225 11534 11159  48.58    *  100   672   205  836:15  fvwm-2.0.43

each one seems to drive the load up by about 1.00.  fortunately, i have
root access on most of the machines i find these processes on (they are
in public labs on our campus), so i can 'su' and kill them, but most
cannot (or wouldn't know how), and if enough of them are present (i
logged into a machine with *5* of these processes this morning), they
can have a noticeable effect on the sluggishness of a machine.

is there a known fix for this (outside of explicitly quitting fvwm), is
it resolved in the next beta (due when?), or what is the status of this
ugliness?

thanks--
--chris.

I think I have to make a little bit clearer what we would like to do:

We have made a set of motif applications to display medical greyscale images 
with sizes in the range from about 256x256 up to more than 2048x2048 pixels.

The window contents of the displayed images may change very often (about 10 
frames per second depending on the image size) due to brightness/contrast 
adjustment.

Since there may be many images displayed on many virtual screens (eg. 32 
virtual screens with two images each) displaying the images in the pager would 
be a big aid in navigating the desktop, i.e. to quickly switch to the virtual 
screen with the image I am looking for.

It should be possible to make an extended pager module which displays the 
scaled down images (using a crude scaling algorithm this could be very fast) 
with reduced colors (eg. 16 grey values) only when an application requests the 
pager to do so (eg. by a new x-event).

So I am asking again if anybody has done this or is willing to this if he gets 
some financial sponsorship?

Werner

I am a simple man and generally seek simple solutions, so I will ask a
simple question:  Can you determine which is the interesting picture by
referencing a name?  The name of a window can be set individually, and
that name is reflected into the pager as a label on the window.  I hope I
do not tax the patience of the list subscribers in posting this. 

It appears that you functionally want a special summary window (which
appears in turn to be most appropriate to obtain from your application
directly in the form of an index page).  This summary window could be
relatively small and could cross-index the other window names.  From
existing fvwm pager labels, you could then easily access the correct
windows.  It seems very appropriate instead of using fvwm-specific
features, for you to consider calling a warp cursor function from this
index page directly to the window manager.  The parent process (I am not 
an X programmer, as will become apparent) should know or have access to 
the window IDs of its children, and should be able to induce the wm to 
warp the cursor to a chosen subwindow, for example, as a result of a mouse 
click in the index window.  xv's "visual schnauzer" mode is an example of 
such an interface without the cursor warp.

no, sorry. they aren't, but focus is mostly equivalent, except for sloppyfocus.

Well FvwmAuto does actually only listen to FocusChange events.
I now added a LeaveCommand, which is executed Timout milliseconds, after
the focus has left the window.

With SloppyFocus, this is not the same as a leave event: If you leave the
window, but don't enter another one - i.e: stay on root - focus doesn't
change. 

It's quite fun to use 
	FvwmAuto 0 Nop iconify
together with 
	style "*" NoIcon
and the windowlist to open windows.
You can of course use lower instead.

Using 
	FvwmAuto 300 raise iconify
does somewhat more dramatic changes to the screen than raise alone.


Experiment.
More confusing actions via separate FvwmAuto's with separate timeouts.

PS to Kai: your problem is special. I still can't get a style flag out of
thin air. You could peruse circulateskip and windowlistskip flags, but the
problem is, there's no 
	if [!circulateskip] command
and the 
	FvwmAuto 300 "Next [!circulateskip,windowid $w] command"
doesn't work yet (timout, I'll have to be in the barracks at 24:00).
- maybe soon (no more changes in FvwmAuto, but bugfixes for the circulate
option parsing part of fvwm2)

have fun,

Simple question, I think I'm missing an obvious syntax error
or something, but its got me puzzled...

A line in my .fvwmrc reads like this:
	Read /home7/dcjk/.fvwm-menus

Lines in .fvwm-menus read like this:
	 
AddToMenu Module-Popup  "%jf.xpm%Selected Modules"      Title
+   "Status Bar"    Module  FvwmButtons StatusBar /home7/dcjk/.fvwm-statusbar
+   "Button Bar"    Module FvwmButtons ButtonBar /home7/dcjk/.fvwm-buttonbar
+   "Control Bar"   Module FvwmButtons ControlBar /home7/dcjk/.fvwm-controlbar
+   "Identify"      Module  FvwmIdent
+   "Pager"         Module  FvwmPager 0 0
+   "Banner"        Module  FvwmBanner
+   "Talk"          Module  FvwmTalk

But when I pop up my menus, select 'Status Bar', I get this in my console:

FvwmButtons v2.0.43 should only be executed by fvwm!

Yet the line above runs fine from FvwmTalk and ran perfectly well inside
.fvwmrc. I only moved the menus put to a separate file recently.

Only the 'statusbar' and 'buttonbar' entries are affected, everything else
runs fine, including the ControlBar. Which is very wierd.

Dear Albrecht,

I do not understand the last FvwmAuto line, but there is in fact a way
to do it without style flags.  Though I agree that it is ugly.  Here's
my proposal, you might want to add your comments on the
meaningfulness.

With the new SendToModule command, it would be easy to add a menu
entry that enables or disables AutoRaise for the particular window for
which it was invoked.  FvwmAuto could read an initial specification of
windows which are to be autoraised as *FvwmAuto lines in .fvwm2rc;
this could then later be changed on a per-window basis with
SendToModule.

I would use the autoraise and autolower features as follows:  the
console window (plus a few others) should always be autoraised (and
-lowered), so I would put them in the *FvwmAuto lines.  After that,
when I create a new xdvi window and feel like it, I turn on autoraise
(and -lower) for that particular window with a key binding or a menu
entry.

Whatcha think?
kai

I recently posted the following question:

A friend made the following suggestion: 

  Key F12  A  A  Function EmacsXdvi

  AddToFunc EmacsXdvi
  +  "I"  Function GoToEmacs
  +  "I"  Key F12 A A XdviEmacs

  AddToFunc XdviEmacs
  +  "I"  Function GoToXdvi
  +  "I"  Key F12 A A EmacsXdvi

This works, but it has the following disadvantages: I don't know how
to bind a button (as in FvwmButtons) to behave similarly, and this
business is annoying if I want to bind several different keys to this
same thing (I'm not using F11-F20 for anything, so rather than bind
one of them and try to remember which one, I thought I might bind a
lot of them to do this).

Any suggestions for improvements?

I have a question about FvwmForm.  I want to write a form for
restarting using another window manager--I want a window to pop up,
with little boxes I can check labeled "fvwm2", "twm", "olwm",
whatever, and then when I check one off, I want to restart using the
appropriate window manager.  

I tried writing such a form, which I called RestartWM.  It has lines
like

  *RestartWMSelection	WM	single
  *RestartWMChoice	WM	fvwm2	on "fvwm2"
  *RestartWMChoice	WM	twm	off "twm"
  *RestartWMChoice	WM	uwm	off "uwm"

and

  *RestartWMButton       quit "Restart"  ^M
  *RestartWMCommand 	Restart $(WM) $(Custom?$(WMOther))

But this last line doesn't work; no matter what I do, I always end up
with fvwm2 running.  I suspect the problem is explained by the second
paragraph in the following passage from the Fwvm man page:

     Restart  WindowManagerName
          Causes fvwm to restart itself if  WindowManagerName  is
          "fvwm2", or to switch to an alternate window manager if
          WindowManagerName is other than "fvwm2".  If the window
          manager  is  not  in your default search path, then you
          should use the full path name for WindowManagerName.

          This command should not have a  trailing  ampersand  or
          any  command  line arguments and should not make use of
          any environmental variables.  Of  the  following  exam-
          ples,  the  first two are sure losers, but the third is
          OK:

               Key F1 R N Restart fvwm &
               Key F1 R N Restart $(HOME)/bin/fvwm
               Key F1 R N Restart /home/nation/bin/fvwm

So, is there a way to write this FvwmForm thing to get around this
difficulty?

Hi all,

I'm new on this list, though I used to read it a while back.  I'm a long-time
user of fvwm and now find myself in a Solaris shop.

I've got and compiled the 2.0.43 version (almost hitch-free) but when it comes
to invoking it I hit problems: viz. it seems even the X-server doesn't start.

I'm trying it from the console screen and entering the command:

	xinit /usr/local/bin/fvwm --

The Solaris banner shows then the whole thing seems to hang -- nothing further
happens (thinks: maybe the banner is Solaris' way of starting the server ...
ordinarily I'd expect the stippled background with the "X" cursor.  If this is
true, maybe it's not getting to fvwm.).

Any and all pointers as to how to start it up under Solaris 2.5 would be ap-
preciated.

Thanks

hi all,
	after succesfully compiling fvwm,i tried to run it. it gave the
folowing error message:
ld.so.1: fvwm: fatal: libXext.so.0: can't open file: errno=2
Killed
libXext.so.0 is in /usr/openwin/lib and i'm NOT installing as root.
also, i have not run "make install" as i thought it was optional.
what do i have to do to correct this problem?

thanx in advance,
ravi.

Here's what I do:

I've got a shell script with the following contents which I invoke:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec openwin -ar1 400 -ar2 25 -dur 200 -nobanner

I've got a file .xinitrc which starts up whatever clients I like, fvwm
being one of them.  I think .xinitrc should be chmod u+x.

"-ar1 400" means wait 400 ms before autorepeat of keys cuts in.  "-ar2
25" means repeat every 25 ms.  "-dur 200" means a BEL lasts 200 ms.
"-nobanner" means start up without the usual OW banner.

IMHO using the openwin script has the advantage that you automagically
use MIT-Magic-Cookie-1 rather than xhost authorization, which is more
secure.

kai

	Hi,
	We start fvwm2 from the (modifed, originally SUN-supplied-)
	user .profile, where we export the Variable OW-WINDOW_MANAGER
	which is then evaluated in the Xinitrc. 

stty istrip

#
# If possible, start the windows system
#
	  if [ `tty` = "/dev/console" ] ; then
	  if [ "$TERM" = "sun" -o "$TERM" = "AT386" ] ; then

		if [ ${OPENWINHOME:-""} = "" ] ; then
			OPENWINHOME=/usr/openwin
			export OPENWINHOME
		fi

#		FVWM2 als Window-Manager und benutze system.fvwm2rc
		export OW_WINDOW_MANAGER="fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME /usr/local/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc'"
# 		benutze eigene .fvwm2rc
#		export OW_WINDOW_MANAGER="fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc'"

		echo ""
		echo "Starting OpenWindows in 5 seconds (type Control-C to interrupt)"
		sleep 5
		echo ""
		$OPENWINHOME/bin/openwin

		clear		# get rid of annoying cursor rectangle
		exit		# logout after leaving windows system

	  fi
	  fi;;
#
# das gilt fuer Linux
	Linux*)	
		export PATH=$PATH:.
		cd $HOME
		case $TERM in
			console*) 	
				echo "  Aufruf von XWindows mit -> startx <-"
				echo "" ;;
			linux*)
				echo "  Aufruf von XWindows mit -> startx <-"
				echo "" ;;
		esac ;;
esac

# Prompt definieren (\h=hostname; \w=directory; \$=Standardprompt)
PS1='\h:\w\$>'

# wechsle in HOME-Verz.
cd

# Abkuerzungen werden in der .bashrc definiert
source .bashrc


	and our (/usr/openwin/lib/)Xinitrc has been modified also:


# @(#)Xinitrc	1.22 93/05/14	OpenWindows startup script.

# wird in der ~/.profile definiert
#OW_WINDOW_MANAGER="fvwm2 -f 'FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME /usr/local/X11/lib/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc'"

xrdb $OPENWINHOME/lib/Xdefaults		# Load Default X11 resource database
if [ -f $HOME/.Xdefaults ]; then
    xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults	# Load Users X11 resource database
fi

$OPENWINHOME/lib/openwin-sys 		# OpenWindows system initialization

eval `locale_env -env`			# Set Locale Environment

if [ "$OW_WINDOW_MANAGER" ]; then	# Alternate Window Manager
    xsetroot -def			# Clear root window
#
	xhost -
#
#	starte Window-manager... (fvwm2)
	eval $OW_WINDOW_MANAGER
#
#	geht nicht!
#   $OW_WINDOW_MANAGER & wmpid=$!	# Start Alt Window Manager
#    wmpid=$! 	
#    dsdm &				    # OpenLook Drop Site Database
#    unset OW_WINDOW_MANAGER
#
else
    sleep 15 & pid=$!			# OpenLook Window Manager
    olwm -syncpid $pid & wmpid=$!
    wait $pid				# Pause until olwm inits

    if [ -x $HOME/.openwin-init ]; then
        $HOME/.openwin-init			# Custom OpenWindows tools
    else
        $OPENWINHOME/lib/openwin-init   	# Default OpenWindows tools
    fi

    wait $wmpid				# Wait for wm (key client) to exit
fi


	In the HOME-dir. there's a .fvwm2desk (as we use the SaveDesk 
	module) which is included into the system.fvwm2rc
	I guess, you should start with 
	export OW-WINDOW_MANAGER=fvwm2
	only. before adding M4-preprocessing (I could also give you
	our system.fvwm2rc and a .fvwm2desk if you want it)

	good luck!

Don't know about your FvwmForm problem, but you could try using the
xsession program instead (available from your local X mirror). You run
it as the last client in .xinitrc or .xsession, or whatever X startup
file you use, and it starts a window manager and manages your session:
e.g.
  xsession -defaultWM fvwm2
is the last line in my .xsession.

It then provides a pulldown menu of window managers you can switch between.

Another big advantage of using xsession is not using the WM itself to
manage the session. This means when you make an erroneous change to
your .fvwm2rc and fvwm2 won't start, you still get X running and can
select another WM while you debug the problem.

Put /usr/openwin/lib in  the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and do a ldconfig.

Put the following in your .xinitrc and run `startx' or `openwin'.

#!/bin/sh

which is not the best thing to do, I think (see below).

the above line is from my alpha version of fvwm (patches are at my
homepage, as soon, as they become stable).
It basically says: go to the next window, that doesn't have the
circulateskip bit set and the windowid $w (window, which has been given
focus) and execute command on it (command is raise, normally).
this is basically a hunchback version if an IF command (if window $w
doesn't have this bit set, do sth).

K> Though I agree that it is ugly. 

mine too, but I think an IF is easy to implement, and a set of user
perusable style bits is very flexible, and doesn't bloat FvwmAuto to a
100k program (it doesn't bloat fvwm itself much, either).

K> Here's my proposal, you might want to add your comments on the
K> meaningfulness.

K> With the new SendToModule command, it would be easy to add a menu

K> this could then later be changed on a per-window basis with
K> SendToModule.

So FvwmAuto would have to do a whole lot more: parse more config entries,
keep that info in a global (linked) list, use this for any window.
This is a duplication of the Fvwm internal linked list of windows,
where only one bit in a 32 bit integer is used for any binary style flag.
(that`s a 64:1 bloat ratio in storage requirements, not to mention the 
code for parsing and the communication, and the respective cpu overhead.)

I'd wait till after The Great Mythical Style Flag Rewrite, which will
hopefully include some user-flags (user1 - user4 ?) which can be used in
conjunction with the PREV/NEXT/NONE (and hopefully someone will implement 
IF and FOREACH) commands.

this would be sth like
	FvwmAuto 300 "if [!user1] raise"
which is equivalent to the soon (when I get the time) usable version
	FvwmAuto 300 "Next [!circulateskip,windowid $w] raise"

K> Whatcha think?
everything clear as mud now?

With all due respect to Guenther, LD_LIBRARY_PATH should only
be used as a last resort on any platform.  From the above it
appears that you are running under SunOS5 (Solaris2), so you'll
need to make use of the -R flag (e.g. -R/usr/openwin/lib) in
addition to -L at link time.  ld.so will then be able to find
the extra libraries at run time.  You should be able to do a
'ldd fvwm' after your build, and see that all libraries are
found.

Also, ldconfig is not utilized/implemented under SunOS5.

Best of luck,

Hi,

I have just compiled fvwm-2.0.43 on a DEC Alpha running OSF1 V3.2 .
Up until a few days ago I used to use the fvwm window-manager off of
another users directory where he had it installed. He no longer has an
account here so I have had to compile it myself.

I have been able to compile and install it on my account but have run
into a problem. I am getting some weird mouse errors. For example when I
try to move a window I can move left and right, to move left I have to
mover the moust UP and to move right I have to move the mouse DOWN. Moving
the mouse left and right while holding the title bar on the window doesnt
do anything at all. I am also having various problems with my
key-bindings. I was wonderinf if anyone else on this mailing list has had
similar problems and have found a way to fix it. 

I am pretty sure that it is not my .fvwmrc file that is causing the
problem because I used to use the same file earlier on the same version of
fvwm without any problems. Any help would be appreciated. I have gone over
the FAQs and bug files but havent been able to find anything.

I work for a systems integration software company, and we have one of
practically every Unix box in house.  I consider Fvwm to be far superior to
most of their window managers and would like to install it wherever possible.
I've been able to get it up and running on all of our Solaris machines
(Sparc 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5; and x86 2.4, 2.5), but all of the other OS's have
session managers which automatically start their window managers (i.e., you
don't have to type xinit or openwin from a command prompt).  I know this
doesn't pertain directly to Fvwm, but can anyone give me any help in setting
up the following OS's to use Fvwm:

	Irix 5.3
	HPUX 9.04 & 10.01
	AIX 3.2 & 4.1
	OSF (Digital Unix) 3.2
	DG/UX 5.4 (RISC) & 4.11 (x86)

As always, thanks in advance...

Hi. 
	I have two questions... The first question regards the fvwm95
page... does ANYONE know what happened to it? or if there is a new site,
where is it? My second question is why the latest version (fvwm 2.0.42a)
does not let you specify the -f option properly. I am on an IRIX 5.3
machine and I cannot seem to get -f to work. It would be very nice, as I
am constantly switching between platforms. I would appreciate private mail
responses, thanx much :)

In case any of you haven't already found the resource for HP-UX, putting

vuesession*wmStartupCommand: /<PATH>/fvwm<whatever>

(I think I got it correctly; check your documentation, and if all else
fails, try it out) into your vue.resources file will fire up fvwm in place
of vuewm.  The downside is that this takes longer (!) to start up fvwm
than if you let vuewm come up, kill it, and then start fvwm.  This is a
great mystery to me.  Another downside is for those of you who have begun
to use vuewm's myriad resource editing gadgets.  Starting fvwm this way
keeps you from accessing them.  I think there is a vue-lite option, from
which it is also possible to start alternate wm, but I never did that.  
As always, YMMV.

Hi, Kendrick --

>  I cannot seem to get -f to work

	It works ok on my 2.0.43 system. Are you specifying the alternate rc
file as

	1) -d /my-directory/my-special-fvwm-rc-file

			or

	2) -d/my-directory/my-special-fvwm-rc-file

...?

	Only the first syntax will work. I've only recently begun following
fvwm development, so I don't know whether the other style used to be honored.

	Good luck,
	Bob

I'm guessing that the 95 hack is so much of a hack that to integrate
the sources back into the main distribution would upset the purists?

I'm new to fvwm95 and I was just curious about the fvwm position on
it?

I've already noticed that fvwm95 seems to be out on it's own so to
speak and I'm wondering what's the best to commit time and resources
to. I do like the way fvwm2's .fvwm2rc file is split with the Read's
which don't appear to have made their way into the fvwm95 release I'm
currently using.

So, will these two source trees be disjoint?

Why for instance can't the 95 hack be a module of fvwm2?

Go easy on me :-)

To: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

X-Majordomo: 1.94-beta2


We've discovered a couple of problems with fvwm 1.24r that make it
difficult to use with our application MetaCard.  The first two are
caused by the fact that MetaCard unusual in that it is an "active
focus" application that *requests* the keyboard focus when it needs it
(the XWMHints.input field is False, and the WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom is
set).  These are all with maximum mwm compatibility specified in the
config files, yet aren't a problem with mwm or olwm.

You can verify all of these problems by getting MetaCard 2.0.1 from
ftp://ftp.metacard.com/MetaCard.  You'll need an engine (precompiled
binary) for whichever platform you're using (e.g., SPARC.gz, Linux.gz,
etc.), the Home stack (mchome.mc.gz) and the tools stack
"mctools.mc.gz".  Gunzip all three parts, chmod +x the engine, then
run it.

1) In the explict/click-to-type focus model, clicking in a window
incorrectly automatically moves the keyboard focus to that window.
The focus should remain in the source window until the application
specifically requests it with XSetInputFocus.  Reproduce by clicking
in a window other than the MetaCard Home stack, then clicking back in
the MetaCard window.  It should only set the focus to the window if
you click on one of the icons in that window.

2) In the pointer focuse model, moving the mouse to a window doesn't
always focus that window.  Reproduce by opening the MetaCard Message
Box and moving the mouse back and forth between it an the Home stack.

3) Calling XRaiseWindow does not cause a configureNotify event to be
sent to the application like it does with mwm.  Our application raises
the menu bar window when the user clicks on a menu button, and needs
the configureNotify message to confirm that the menu has been raised
before opening the menu panel (otherwise, the menu bar can be raised
*after* the panel is opened if the window manager is slow to respond).
MetaCard has a 500 msec timeout for the wait for the message, but this
problem makes opening menus with fvwm very tedious.  Reproduce by
opening the MetaCard menu bar and clicking on a menu: there is a delay
between the click and the panel opening (this isn't a problem with
mwm).

======================================================================
And now for a plea for a change of default focus policy in fvwm from
pointer to explicit focus.  The current default of pointer focus is
provably inferior to explicit focus, and really puts Linux in
particular at a major disadvantage to Micro$oft products in the
marketplace because it is user-hostile and industry non-standard.  All
other workstations and/or operating systems ship with explicit (click
to type) focus by default, including Sun, HP, IBM, all vendors that
ship the COSE Desktop, Apple, NeXT, and Microsoft.  This industry
standard is the mode that 99.9% of current computer users are familiar
with, and has been shown to be easier for novice computer users to
grasp.

As for the provably inferior part, here are a few scenarios using our
product MetaCard, among the commercial X products that is most like
applications found on MS-Windows and the Mac:

A) Like many Mac and Windows applications, when the user opens or
traverses to editable text fields in MetaCard dialogs, the text in the
field is automatically selected to make it more efficient to change
the value (since you just type in the new value instead of having to
delete the old value first).  This doesn't work very well with pointer
focus, because every time you move the mouse out of the window, it
selects the text in some other window.  Not only is the flashing very
annoying, but it also makes it impossible to use the menu bar to
cut/copy/paste selections, since the selection changes when you move
the mouse up to the menu bar (which is in another window).  There is
no workaround for this problem other than using explicit focus.

B) Like many Mac and Windows applications, MetaCard relies heavily on
floating palettes and other modeless dialogs.  To facilitate this,
MetaCard is an "active focus" application, which means that the
keyboard focus doesn't necessarily go to these windows when the user
clicks in them (to select a tool, choose a menu, or run a layout
script).  This allows the user to designate the window to which the
operation should be applied by making it the focused window.  This
technique doesn't work with pointer focus, because the mere act of
moving to a tool palette focuses that palette, a useless operation
with potentially devistating consequences as the user may then lose
track of which window the operation will be applied to.

Continued use of pointer focus as the default will just demonstrate a
total lack of respect for industry standards by the fvwm developers,
prevents many advanced applications (such as MetaCard) from working
well on many Linux systems, annoys and confuses novice users, and is
generally detrimental to the success of products such as Linux that
deserve all the help they can get.
  Regards,
   Scott

I'm new to fvwm hacking, but after getting 2.0.43 I found the window list
still wasn't working.  It would raise the window and transfer focus to it,
sure, but because I have point to focus set it would immediately unfocus the
window.

I changed it to warp to the pointer to the window after raising it, if the
window isn't click to focus, otherwise the window list was pretty dumb.

As far as I can tell raise_it_func is only called to raise windows from the
window list, so I hacked it to this:

void raise_it_func(XEvent *eventp,Window w,FvwmWindow *tmp_win,
                   unsigned long context, char *action, int *Module)
{
  int val1_unit,n;
  long val1;
  n = GetOneArgument(action, &val1, &val1_unit);
  if(val1 != 0)
  {
    if (((FvwmWindow *)(val1))->flags & ICONIFIED)
    {
      DeIconify((FvwmWindow *)val1);
    };
    FocusOn((FvwmWindow *)val1,0);
    if (!(((FvwmWindow *)(val1))->flags & ClickToFocus))
      WarpOn((FvwmWindow *)val1,0,0,0,0);
  }
}

SmartPlacement leaves a 1 pixel gap around every window when it places
them, so you get a 2 pixel gap between any 2 windows and a 1 pixel gap
between any window and the edge of the screen.  I find this irritating and
the following patch fixes it.  If you prefer, you can also get the entire
placement.c file from http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c
This should work with any fairly recent version of fvwm or fvwm95, as the
placement.c file hasn't changed for a long time.  This has been well
tested by me (it's a fairly simple change).  Let me know if anyone has any
problems.

There are three problems: 

1. I'm not sure how well the current module interface
is suited for a module that is resposible for drawing all of the decorations
and whatnot. 

2. fvwm95 is different from fvwm in more ways that just new titlebars. For
example, they have been busy creating new types of packets to send to modules,
and so has fvwm (SendToModule is only in fvwm for example, and until recently,
the mini-icon packet was only in fvwm95). Also, the style flags are diverging.

3. When you have two groups of people working on software, and they aren't
forced by some higher power to cooperate, it seems inevitable that they will
continue to diverge.

One additional problem:

4. Fvwm is a free piece of software developed by a lot of people. As such
there is no "fvwm position" on just about anything. Sitting around and waiting
for one is rarely productive. The single best way to get a "position" to form
is to put fingers to keyboard, write the code, and then hope that everybody
else says "cool." I'd recommend getting in touch with Chuck Hines, before
starting anything major, and also I'd wait until after the official release 
is made and the things stabilize. 

I think that merging fvwm95 and fvwm together again (note that I didn't say
merge fvwm95 back into fvwm. It's changed enough to be considered a seperate
project, if in its infancy) will certainly require rewriting a large fraction
of fvwm (and fvwm95). As such, nobody's going to be much happy about it on
either side unless it is accompanied by clear improvements. For example, if
a better way is found to interface modules to fvwm that allows for a new
family of neato modules to be written (the options I see: and embedded
language like guile or python, dynamic linking, or some sort of
rpc). Otherwise, all you've succeeded in doing is tearing your house down and
living in a tent in the back yard for a few months so that you can rebuild
your house with a new type of flooring. 

I think the best way to proceed is to get a clear answer to the question:
What improvements need to be made to fvwm which would make it all around
cooler, smaller, faster, and/or better, from which adding a module to make
it look and feel like windows 95 would just fall out?

For Digital Unix use the following:

1.) Click on "Options->Window" in the session manager menu.
2.) Under the Window Manager Title, choose "Other" instead of "Default"
    and enter the path to the fvwm executable into the entry field.

Log-out and log-in again.

This setting just causes the following Resource to be set in the
.Xdefaults of the User's Home directory:

      DXsession.windowManagerName:    /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/fvwm

If you want to make it the default for all users, just put it in

          /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/DXsession

Hope that helps -- Tom

P.S: Beware, though, that this setup requires a patch to FVWM 2.0.43. 
     Without the patch, you can have dead FVWM processes lying around
     after logging out. These processes eat up all CPU time they can
     get.

Well, maybe I'm wrong but I think the only thing which makes fvwm95
interesting for the standard-user is the Win95-look.
 As most of the users didn't even looked at the .fvwm2rc95 (or just
added a couple of menu entries), if we can emulate the Win95 look just
like fvwm95, we can can almost consider that the merging is done :).
I didn't look at the -solid option of andrew's titlebar patch, but as
mini-icons will (should :)) be included in the next fvwm2 beta
version...


Just my 10 centimes...

There is also the fixed window sizing code, menu positioning, etc.
Also, some Mouse Warping has been eliminated (all of it I hope).

How about this for a new window placement policy, CleverPlacement?  Currently
we have SmartPlacement, which avoids all overlap and gives up if it can't,
and DumbPlacement (er, RandomPlacement), which sticks the windows semi-randomly
on the screen.  CleverPlacement should be like SmartPlacement, it tries to
avoid overlap.  If it can't avoid it entirely, it tries to minimize it.

If I have two windows, each 100% vertical size and 51% horizontal size, the
the best way to place them is so they fill the whole screen and overlap just
a bit in the middle.

Anyone have an idea on a heuristic to try and find the least overlapping
position?

Hi!
I suppose this is somewhat related to the present discussion about fvwm
and fvwm95. I'm presently using 95 and was having a fiddle with
FvwmButtons to try and simulate the task bar. (Would this be one way to
go about it? do something about the appearance and use buttons for the
task bar? But then I've no idea how it all works so....!) This was
originally sourced from a config for version 1. Anyway I've been trying
to get it to work, at present under 95 (wouldn't think it would make any
difference...?) Basically it starts up then disapears. Ideally I'd like
it to be similar to the taskbar -
  menu button; window list; clock/ mail indicator
Okay, any debugging help would be *much* appreciated!

I was planning to do some work on this, but have just been too busy;
I'll share my thoughts and perhaps someone else will get around to
putting together some code before I do.

Currently, SmartPlacement is implemented something like this:
    Let x, y = 0
    loop
	try to place the window at (x,y)
	if the placement does not result in overlap
	    return (x,y)

	set x to the right margin of the overlapping window
	if x + window width > right side of screen
	    x = 0
	    y = y + 1
	    if y + window height > bottom of screen
		fail

Note that since y is only incremented by 1, it can take thousands of
iterations to conclude that there's no room on the desktop.

A possible optimization: keep a sorted list of the y coordinate of the
bottom edge of each existing window; then instead of adding 1, set y to
the next-higher element of the list.  (Why this algorithm works is left
as an exercise.)

Once this improvement is made, the following enhancement becomes
feasible: each time an (x,y) placement fails, calculate the area of
overlap between that placement and all windows on the screen.  Reject
the placement if this overlap exceeds the smallest found so far.  (In
fact, when traversing the list of windows to calculate the total
overlap, you can stop early once you've found enough overlapping area to
eliminate the placement as a candidate.)

If an overlap of 0 is found during this process, that position is
returned and CleverPlacement works like SmartPlacement.  If it hits the
bottom of the screen before finding such a 'perfect' placement, it uses
the best guess it found.

This method could be made even smarter if it kept a sorted list of the
right edges of each window as well as the bottom edges, and considered
each of those x positions as possible 'secondary' candidates even though
some of them had no chance of being the 'perfect' placement.

Another possible addition to the heuristic: when calculating overlap,
count window title bars and decorations as triple their actual area, in
order to discourage placing windows on top of them.

Thoughts?

Hi FVWM-gurus!

I recently upgraded to fvwm version 2.0.43 and I have two questions:

1) I use FvwmButtons on a monochrome display.  In version 1 I got a
nice button-look, where the buttons get depressed when I press them.
In version two they are just white, I assume that the color used for
the relief/shades is white as well.  I can see from the documentation
that fvwm uses the FvwmButtonsBack color to calculate a relief and a
shade color.  Maybe fvwm should detect the monochrome display and use
dithering to represent the relevant graytone.  Or maybe there should
be a new option to specify these colors, then we who suffer from a
monochrome display can select it as the foreground color, and we will
be able to get the button effect back.

2) I use 'Style "*" ClickToFocus' since I prefer the click-to-focus
mode.  However, when a window disappears focus reverts to the last
window that had focus, even if that window has been iconified.  I
would prefer that iconified programs never get keyboard focus, maybe a
NoIconFocus style option?  Or maybe keyboard focus should go to the
topmost not-iconified window when the window having focus cease to
exist?

Any comments?

Jakob.

On AIX 4.1 you should be able to go into smit and do the following:
	1) Select "System Management"
	2) Select "Change System User Interface"
	3) Here you have 3 selections -- choose "Command line"
or use:
	/usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -d

You'll need to be logged in as root and then you'll have to reboot the
system.

I'm not aware that the default AIX 3.2 image includes an auto session
manager initialization.  You may have the login manager installed and it
could have been setup via the command line on all of 3.2 machines. 
You'll probably have to use the dtconfig command line option above to
disable it.

Another possible addition to the heuristic: when calculating overlap,

I've started the progress of making it an option in fvwm2, too.
That's a look and feel question like clicktofocus/focusfollowsmouse &
sloppyfocus.

Fvwm2 should be able to do both, and it's no big hassle.

It's not too far away from fvwm95.

I considered doing this myself when I was fixing up the SmartPlacement
code so that it didn't leave a 1 pixel gap around the windows.

I'll do it (tonight?)

Done.  I did this when I was fixing the placement code so that it didn't
leave a gap.  But my code, although cleaner than the existing code, was
also larger, and I thought less likely to be accepted.  The existing
SmartPlacement, although crude, is surprisingly compact.

This is basically what I had in mind.  I will take a look at it (implement
it?) tonight.

It's not just what makes fvwm95 interesting to the user. It's also what makes
it interesting to the people writing the code for it. Just adding the win95
stuff to fvwm is not by itself a guarantee that they are going to stop
developing fvwm95. As is pointed out by others in this thread, the two window
managers are diverging in more ways than just titlebars and such.

Also, not everybody wants to see more and more code getting added to fvwm.

I means that you don't have the Xpm library or it can't find it.

If you dont' have it try looking in Fvwm.tmpl and defining HasXpm NO.

Hi, Kendrick  --

	Duhhh.... Connect fingers to brain before typing. Read before pushing
Send button. Of course you're right, it's "-f". I was curious whether there 
was a space between the flag and the filename. Sorry for the confusion. Don't
try "-d". You wouldn't like it. :-)

Ouch!

First, the default focus policy is a site/distribution decision.  You
would be better off haranguing them.

Second, fvwm 2 allows the focus policy to be set on a per window basis,
so it could be MouseFocus for most things, but ClickFocus for
MetaCard.

Hi all! 

   since we are near to a new beta and/or to a release, I want to 
remind a couple of buglets that I suffer with 2.0.43. The big problem is 
that all these bugs happens in no fixed way: sometime you see it, 
sometime no. Let me resume my setup (more info on demand):
- sloppyFocus for most windows, other windows ClickToFocus
- FvwmRaise 1500
- SmartPlacement, ActivePlacement
- OpaqueMoveSize 40 

System: Linux (redhat picasso, so quite new, kernel 2.0.20) on a 486/66
with 16M ram (so not amazingly fast machine).

Let go with the problems:

  1) sometimes when I want a new window from a menu (window with 
sloppyfocus) it appears _below_ the previous active window: it has 
focus but _not_ raise up automatically (well, I think that it should be 
foreground in the first time). Happens a lot with rxvt.
  
  2) sometimes when the pointer is in a transient window and the window
disappear, the ponter got converted to a big bold dot (aaargh! again!) 
and I have to click with mouse to resynchronize things.

  3) this is more reproducible: have a big new window and I have to place 
it on the desktop, so the frame appear. If I move quite rapidly the 
mouse, sometime the frame stops, and after a bit (less than a second) it 
jumps to reach again the mouse. 


I would like to help coding, but it's really far from my X expertize. But 
I can test patches... thank you very much!

Best regards,
              Romano

What about shaped windows ? If you treat a shaped window as if it was a
rectangle then your method will work fine. If you want your new window to
use the "transparent" space of the shaped window then this method will
fail.

It means the dynamic linker can't find libXpm.so.4.3. Have you got the
Xpm library? If not you can get it at ftp.x.org:/contrib/libraries.

So will the current method.  The existing code determines overlap based
on the rectangular bounds of the windows on the screen and the window
being placed.  There is no case where my optimized method will fail to
place a window where the current code would have placed it anyway. 

Dealing with shaped windows is a *much* harder problem, and it's my
opinion that fvwm shouldn't try to solve it.

_IF_ the "industry standards" were any good, I wouldn't be using fvwm.

Insisting of click focus demonstrates both a lack of design flexibility
and a total lack of respect for user preferences by the MetaCard
developers, prevents many advanced system tools (such as Linux and fvwm)
from working well with MetaCard, annoys and confuses both novice users and
those of us who must support them (and the later group quite often
influence purchasing decisions), and is generally detrimental to the
success of products such as MetaCard that frankly may not deserve any
help.

I support 200 Win95 users. My most frequent request is to install Xmouse,
an unsupported (yet Microsoft-developed) extension to Win95 that
implements pointer focus for Win95.

Which only goes to show that the problem is MetaCard not supporting fvwm,
and not fvwm's lack of support for MetaCard.

Now, I use ClickToFocus as my default, because I (generally) like it.

BUT, I also know too many applications that like to grab focus when they start
up, and with ClickToFocus and these applications, one can be merrily typing
to an xterm (or something) when SUDDENLY one is typing to the application.
And if the next character you type is <return>, it can often select something
you didn't want to...

The way to go with a tool like fvwm (which is DESIGNED to allow people to
choose what they want) is to give them the choice. It's not like there's a
single vendor (as with Microthingy) to decide - Unix isn't like that - and
there ISN'T a standard in any useful sense (hey, there isn't even an
"industry" standard, or I wouldn't know so many [irritating, mark you] people
who like other focus strategies).

Now, now, let's be gentle here....but I rather thought Mr. Raney's message 
looked unnecessarily flameable, too.

Yes, Mr. Raney actually phrased things this way.  I think he must be
peeved at the different behavior of "standard" mwm and its brethren as
opposed to the occasionally idiosyncratic way fvwm appears to handle
things.  It is _possible_ that fvwm is rigorously enforcing the standard
protocol while other products are invoking nonstandard special handling. 
I am not in a position to assess the matter.  However, I can overlook the
rather strident form of Mr.  Raney's protest (posted about 9 pm after
perhaps a long day at work) and examine the content.

Yes, I use pointer focus and detest click-to-focus and autoraise.  Not 
all users have the same opinions.  And yes, fvwm does attempt to support 
all options.  But Mr. Raney has identified purportedly exceptional 
circumstances.

If a developer is including the Linux world (and such of the commercial
world as use fvwm, which is a growing segment) in his market audience,
this seems good to me.  He does seem to be confusing Linux and fvwm,
however large the overlap may be.  He has some rational expectation that
his application will behave in similar ways under different
implementations of the applicable standards.  Mr.  Raney seems to be
complaining about the different behavior of his MetaCard application under
fvwm with respect to that under mwm.  His protest has some basis in fact. 
I have problems with a certain Motif application that appear similar to
those Mr. Raney mentions.  These problems may be due to the
ConfigureNotify message handling mentioned by Mr. Raney, as they involve
menu boxes being obscured as a result of a RaiseWindow event for the main
window executed after the menu creation (under fvwm/twm, but not
mwm/vuewm).  I am not sufficiently skilled in programming to follow up on
this, but I very much appreciate the specific suggestions he made, and I
filed his message away for future reference when and if I decide to
develop said skills.

Yes, a README for the MetaCard distribution would be an appropriate idea. 
But _if_ MetaCard programmers have found a misbehavior of fvwm, I would
think it appropriate to fix it.  The accompanying request to change the
default pointer focus behavior for fvwm is (I think) very much another
matter.  It is unreasonable to insist that the present focus default is
irresponsible.  If one were marketing fvwm, then it would be a question of
$ and market share, and the answer would come from a customer vote.

This is encouraging, as I think it shows signs of independent thinking on 
the part of Microsoft users (;^)

See above reference to Mr. Raney's ConfigureNotify "bug" report.

I am using fvwm version 2.0.42 and there is a problem with the
autoraise module.  When I'm using a program which menus such as xemacs
or netscape and click on a menu, sometimes the netscape window will
raise up over the menu.  So the menu is still active, but I can't see
it or access it.

in this case, I did use -f <filename> ... At my university, I have 3-4

Perhaps it was a bit strong, but we've been pointing out the inherent
and insurmountable problems of using pointer focus with real GUI
applications (as opposed to xterms) for years now, and have sent
requests in to the fvwm developers before with no effect.  And the
statement is true: explicit focus is the de facto industry standard,
and although having a contrarian streak is a stereotypical
characteristic of Linux users (and probably of fvwm users on other
platforms), there are times when playing nice with the other children
is the right thing to do.

I'm not arguing against choice, only that the *default* setting should
be the one that will benefit the most users.  It just seems unfair
(and unwise) to me that those who are least able to make the changes
(new users) are the ones who are stuck with the task.  *You* know how
to set up fvwm and will probably be changing the configuration anyway
to suit your needs, so why not just make the default the one that's
best for the X and UNIX community as a whole?

I realize that they are separate, and it's good that you realize that

The MetaCard installation instructions include details about how to
change the focus model for mwm and olwm (which together account for
about 98% of our installed base).  But these two both come configured
with explicit focus from the vendors, so there's no need to change
them in most cases.  And although you're correct that this is a
site/distribution decision, I think you underestimate the importance
of the recommendations (in the form of default settings) made by the
developers of the individual packages.

Even though you're not selling fvwm, it is certainly in all of our
bests interest that the largest number of people find it easy to learn
and easy to use (especially on most Linux systems, where fvwm is the
default window manager).  Unless you care to dispute the fact that
most people are familiar with explicit focus, or that explicit focus
is easier to learn for novices, the correct default setting seems clear.

I actually find it confusing, unless these Windows users are former
workstation users.  Windows is exactly the kind of environment that I
was refering to that doesn't work very well with pointer focus.
Actually the problems aren't as bad in Windows applications as they
are with X applications because Windows has floating palettes that
stay on top even when they lose the focus, and because there is no
way to do "active focus" applications in Windows (clicking in a window
always activates that window in Windows).

It's also confusing because pointer focus really only has advantages
when you're dealing primarily with xterm-type windows (as I invariably
discover is the standard tool of pointer focus afficianados).  When
your rarely or never use them, pointer focus is just a pain in the ass
because you're constantly having to move the mouse before you can type
in dialogs and such.

This is really putting the cart before the horse: you buy a computer
to run applications, not a window manager.  If your applications work
with other window managers but not fvwm, it's fvwm that's broken, not
the applications.  We'd like to support Linux as best we can, and to
support choice in window managers on other workstations.  But to do
this we need better compatibility between fvwm and either mwm or olwm.

And there are problems with click-to-focus, too.  I personally find
explicit focus annoying.  A "real" gui application should be able to
handle both focus paradigms because not all users like the explicit
paradigm.  If your application doesn't work very well with pointer focus,
maybe you should rethink its design.

I'm missing something. Please explain the situation where explicit focus
helps you travel around an application's windows better than
pointer-focus.  Focus is on a per-window basis, not a per-application
basis, right?  So with explicit focus, you _always_ have to move the
pointer and click it on another window of the application, right?

Well coming from the standpoint of a person that *started* windows-type
GUI interface use on Win3.1 (*blech*) and was migrated to olwm, the very
first thing I did in my search to customize olwm to my liking was find out
what the whole mouse focus thing was.  I instantly fell in love with mouse
focus, and have used it ever since (ol(v)wm, fvwm, win95, NT4).  As for
'de facto' standards, they just *happened* to pick click-to-focus as the
default back in the beginning (posibly influenced by MS, or who knows what
else) and it's stuck like that.  But that's not the point.  Whether or not
fvwm has click-to-focus as default, any software that expects to compete
on the market should *gracefully* handle the possibilities.  Whether or
not these problems are 'insurmountable' there are ways of at least dealing
with them.

What I'd like to know is:  what 'new user' is going to be installing their
own copy of fvwm?  It's up to the site system admin to determine what he
wants as default for all his users.  I don't even know what the defaults
are for any of my software as I read the documentation and decide then
what behaviour I want.  It's the job of the admin to make the environment
suit those people he's maintaining systems for, not necessarily the
software developers responsibility.  It'd be nice if they supply a decent
set of defaults, and in the realm of fvwm I see that being what the
majority of users wants (not 'de facto' standard) which just happens to be
mouse-focus from what I've heard.

What if the user doesn't *want* the focus to be click-to-focus?  And as
for the recommendations, obviously those are for the developers of each
individual package to make.  Maybe fvwm suggests mouse-focus because all
the development people like it more?  So be it.

Whether or not the correct default setting is clear, you should be
allowing for the obvious fact that many people prefer mouse-focus, and
will continue doing so.

Whether or not pointer(mouse)-focus is confusing is up to the individual
user.  I can't stand click-focus, it's bothersome.  Instead of moving my
mouse to within a windows constraints, I get to move it to any of the
handles (which I make miniscule as they get in my way) and with sheer luck
click on the handle to bring it to focus.  As you may have noticed,
pointer focus has it's main advantage with xterm (or single window input)
applications.  These are the realm of the developer.  Editors (whether
true X-editors or vi in an xterm) are my mainstay.  WordPerfect,
FrameMaker, and vi in an xterm.  So face it - fvwm started as a developers
choice, so obviously it's going to have remnants of that past even as it
becomes a favorite in mainstream useage.

As for having to move to the dialog box to type things in, I rather
appreciated the method olwm used.  If you explicitly activated the dialog,
warp the pointer and grab focus.  If not, map the window and don't grab
focus or warp the pointer.  The real beauty would be warping the pointer
to a dialog box, and then unwarping it back to its original position.

I buy my computer to run apps, and get fvwm to have a window manager I
like, (with mouse-focus).  If my app doesn't work with my window manager
the way *I* want my window manager to work, it's the app that's broken.

I've never seen such a list posted to this forum.  Why don't you post
your list of problems and let us debate them point by point?  I'd
especially like to know what it is about your application that doesn't
work with pointer-focus.  I really don't buy the argument that
pointer-focus is inherently flawed.  And what is your definition of a
`real GUI application'?

Double hmm.

Are you saying that if I wanted to use MetaCard I'd have to buy into
click-to-focus for my entire desktop?!  I have no idea what MetaCard
is or does, but not cooperating with pointer-focus would a huge
disincentive for me ever using a product -- especially if it were GUI
product!  (or at least I'd complain loudly and often on the bug list
:-) I'm sorry but that just seems very arrogant for an application to
force this global change on its users.  I certainly don't begrudge
those who like click-to-focus since its inherently a religious issue,
but remember, the key initial in GUI is `U'!  :-)

But maybe I'm jumping to conclusions about the interoperability
problems of MetaCard and pointer-focus.  Please clarify!

Do you have statistics.  I'd really like to know how many of users
that are aware of having a choice between the two models, actually do
prefer to use click-to-focus, as opposed to just having no idea they
had a choice and using whatever mwm or dtwm gives them as a default.
You might be right, but I'd still like to see the results of a study.

Well, I'm still unconvinced that point-focus can't work just fine,
even for applications with lots of windows.  Take Grail
<http://monty.cnri.reston.va.us/grail/>, a free web browser we've
written that's implemented in Python/Tk.  In the next release, you'll
be able to drive the thing almost entirely from the keyboard, and even
as separate top level windows pop up and down (e.g. to interact with
the Bookmarks, History, or File dialogs), focus is managed correctly
to the subwindows without ever having to move the mouse (as long as
its one of the application's top level windows), even with
pointer-focus.  Okay, I'm not an Xpert so maybe there's some inherent
design flaw in X I'm not aware of.  I've just never seen it as a real,
unsurmountable problem with all the apps I've used over the years.
Even XEmacs (although it has some bugs) handles focus management in
subordinate top-level windows that do not contain the pointer.

Nope, its just that not all applications manage active focus
correctly.  Its one of the main reasons why I can't stand Netscape on
X.  I hit Meta-O and the dialog that pops up doesn't get focus.  It
was nearly trivial for me to add this to Grail, *and* to move focus
back to the original window when finished interacting with the dialog.

Sorry, but this is backwards, unless I bought my computer to only run
MetaCard.  My applications should honor my environmental preferences.
They should not dictate to me what's for my own good especially for
such fundamentally religious issues as focus policy.

Hi,

Well generally I consider myself a lurker in this list, more for the
purpose of learning and judging when I should make the jump from 1.24r to
2.x.

But when I read the message that started this thread (by Scot? I believe;
anyway) I must admit I reacted just as strongly against the idea or
explicit focus.

Now on to my point...

Admittedly I do use mostly xterm based windows.  This is probably the
reason I insist on pointer focus.

Yes it would be nice if application developers made sure their software was
compatible with both paradigms but I'm not sure if you can consider the
application "broken" if it does not.

Well for my two cents worth (know understand I admit to not understanding
the inner workings of a window manager) I find pointer focus very useful
for most of my applications.  In my situation I am running two 3x3 desktops
with 12 to 30 windows on each.  Switching windows quickly, cuting and
pasting are two of my major window manager activities.  Having explicit
focus (and god forbid, extra keystrokes/button presses to cut and paste)
would greatly reduce my efficiency and increase my annoyance!

On the other hand, when I am using "real GUI application" pointer focus can
be a pain.  There are a few perks with explicit focus that really improves
the usability of GUI apps.

Finally if I had it my way I would be able to configure either focus
paradigms (which is the default does not matter) not only in an exclusive
manner (chose one or the other) but, even better, on a per
window/application basis also.  

In my perfect wm world Mega-card (and such) would use explicit focus and 
my xterm based windows would use pointer focus.  GUI apps would gain focus
when I click on their window(s) and lose focus when I either move over a
pointer focus window or click on another explicit focus window.

IMHO....Merlin.

I don't think it's necessary in X to warp the pointer (usually a bad
thing) to redirect focus to any other top-level window within an
application.  I seem to remember this being called `passive' focus
model in X, but again, I'm not an Xpert.

For me, I use pointer focus. I remember when I was first
introduced to the X-window system, I immediately adopted
the pointer-focus model. I have been using it since.
I remember that, when I was a novice with this, I found it counfusing
having the pointer in one window and typing in an other...

A reasonable thing to do, but only if you ask the tens of millions of
Windows and Mac users and billions of non computer users to vote too.
After all, we're talking about what's best for most people, not the
few power users who know exactly what the issues are and what they
want.

You were probably not given any choice and accepted the default.  This
is a common event, and one we should recognize means that the default
setting is important.

> I remember that, when I was a novice with this, I found it counfusing
> having the pointer in one window and typing in an other... 

Actually, early research at Apple clearly showed that the opposite was
more likely to be a problem, usually because a dialog opened.  For
example, the naive user's first reaction when a file selection dialog
opens should be to attempt to type in a file name.  This only works if
the dialog gets the focus when it's opened.  Unless you want to head
down the slippery slope of pointer warping, this means explicit focus.

Your confusion was undoubtedly due to the situation where you've got
multiple xterm windows open, since the opposite problem occurs when
you've got a modern GUI application (and by that I mean one that uses
dialogs and palettes).  It's still amazing to me that people who work
primarily with the "stone age" version of GUI technology (xterms) have
the nerve to stand up and say that pointer focus is superior and
should be the default.  My whole point is that given the choice, most
people want true GUI applications instead of command-line tools, and
that these applications work better with explicit focus.  A point that
no one has provided a defensible argument against.

If we can't do any better than xterms as a primary work environment,
the X market is going to continue its slide toward oblivion because
people just won't bother with it when there are GUI systems that give
them everything they want and need without having to use a
command-line interface.

Perhaps you missed my original post.  It detailed why certain GUI
techniques are *impossible* to use efficiently with pointer focus.
And you're not going to get very far with an argument that the vast
majority of users (who use explict focus) should be forced to use a
lower-functionality application because more using advanced GUI
techniques don't work well with the non-standard setup some users
find works better in their xterm-based world.

Well, in *true* pointer focus there is no keyboard traversal at all,
you have to move the mouse into each field in turn to fill out a form.
I don't see too many people advocating we go back to *that*.  Its
about time we take the next step, or at least reduce the incidence of
corruption of new users by making the default explicit focus.

No, you click on a button (or choose from a menu, or activate a menu
item with a mnemonic or accelerator) and it opens a dialog that gets
the focus.  You then type whatever you want and then close it by
pressing return, upon which the dialog closes and focus returns to the
application window that had it before.  This is the most standard
operating method of modern GUI applications, and it just doesn't work
very well with pointer focus.

My apologies to the list for flaming. While I stand by the
substance of my comments, the tone was inappropriate. 

Focus style is a matter of personal preference. Applications should not
assume a certain focus style. If an application design requires a
particular focus style, the requirement should be documented and the
developer should make a good faith effort to either inform users of the
procedure for setting the desired style, or point users at the source of
this information. 

Explicit focus is fine in a novice setting, but it works against the user
who understands and wants to take advantage of a multitasking environment. 
Just because I do something that makes a program request input (i.e., I
click on an icon that brings up a dialog box) doesn't mean that I want to
(or even can) provide that input right away. Consider an analogy:  Let's
say that you call Bob and leave a message for him to get back to you, then
hang up and call Joe. While you are dialing Joe, Bob gets your message and
calls you back. In the explicit focus world, you don't get a choice: Joe
is put on hold (or hung up on - I can provide an example) and you have to
talk to Bob.

Why do developers treat free software differnet from commercial? Imagine
that you are porting a Windows app to a Motif environment, and you
encounter a similar difference between Windows' and Motif's way of doing
things. Would you threaten to not support Motif? Of course not; you would
alter your design. 

Some of us choose fvwm because the industry standard doesn't work
for us. If the only concern is to comply with "standards", why bother
developing for any other platform than Microsoft? That's where the
industry is. Thouse of us who choose to use free software such as Linux
and fvwm are natually testy about criticisom that amounts to  "it's not
the same as motif."

XEmacs is a pretty poor example of good UI design IMHO.  It's very
efficient to work with (we use it here), but if you tried to sell it
to a Mac or Windows user they'd laugh you right out of town.

I see, let's take the only decent UI that the vast majority of X users
have ever used and ruin it because it doesn't work well with the
environment that works well with xterm windows.  Your argument goes
*exactly* to my point: users new to computers are much more likely to
use Netscape than they are to use xterms.  Fvwm should come with the
defaults set to take this into consideration.

So you're saying that application vendors have no right to expect any
sort of standardization of desktop environments?  Hope you like hand

Show me a real high-tech power user, be him/her a programmer or engineer, and
you'll see a person who barely uses the mouse.  Command-lines, programs,
scripts and aliases will always be MUCH faster than some bozo clicking around
with a mouse pushing buttons.  That's why xterms are wonderful.

With that said, this is all just religion.  I won't change mine and I'm certain
nobody else will change theirs.  So, let's just provide all possible
functionality and let the users choose ... even if their wrong. :)

    A reasonable thing to do, but only if you ask the tens of millions of
    Windows and Mac users and billions of non computer users to vote too.

Most people like what they used first, that's what their belief
system is set up to believe is naturally correct.   This applies
to window systems, editors, operating systems, cars, ...

Most new users (first time users) I have observed can't believe
that you actually have to click the button to make a window active,
and keep forgetting.   Sure they learn soon enough, but it is by
no means intuitive.

    You were probably not given any choice and accepted the default.  This
    is a common event, and one we should recognize means that the default
    setting is important.

yes, it certainly is, and should be mouse focus, not click, always.
    
    This only works if the dialog gets the focus when it's opened.

yes.

    Unless you want to head down the slippery slope of pointer
    warping, this means explicit focus.

Rubbish - simply create the dialog box under the pointer.   Then
you know the pointer will be in the window without warping.  What's
more it is more natural, as the pointer will be in the app window,
and thus in the area where the user is concentrating.   It is only
those rude applications that insist on putting pop-ups in the middle
of the screen which cause problems.

If you want to (and you probably do) work well with users who do
use click focus, and so may have moved the pointer somewhere in
oblivion, check if the pointer is in the window, if it is, put the
dialog under it, if it isn't, and the app still has focus, then
put the dialog anywhere over the window.  If the app doesn't have
focus, then the user is working elsewhere, and the dialog should
not demand attention in any case.

Your other complaint (pop-ups being obscured) I think was a
complaint about auto-raise, which I consider a heinous crime against
morality, and would like to ban totally, if the user wants a window
on top, let it be explicitly moved to the top, not just spring
there.

kre

ps: I use both xterms & true guis, whichever I use, pointer/mouse
focus always works better.  Some apps annoy me no end, because they
contrive to make life difficult rather than easy, but that isn't
the fault of the focus model.

Well, actually as I remember it, click to focus was the default.
I guess because the window manager was motif based, and for motif
click to focus was the default. I just didnt like it. So I figured 
out how to change this. XmNkeyboardFocusPolicy was one of the first
resources
I learnt.

Well, I agree that its convenient when a dialog pops up, and the field
you want gets immediately the focus. But usually there is more than one
(text) field in this dialog. And the field you want is not always the
field
that has the explicit focus. For me, I found it always annoying
discovering
that I actually typed things into the wrong fields because I just forgot
to 'click'.
I know it works much better if you use the return and tab keys but
somehow I 
always liked pointer focus better. Especially if the application has the
'highlight on enter' resource set. It makes a much more lively
impression.
But, anyway, thats what I did.. I'll look around at my work, see what
other
people are using.

I have no opinion about what the default should be. But, I think you
are advocating more than just a default. You seem to think that it is
a good idea for developers to ignore peoples use of pointer focus.  It
is laborious for me to have to click on a window in
order to manipulate it regardless of wether it's xterm based or
not. (The problem with selections being lost when you move to a menu
sounds serious, but hopefully there is some other solution than
requiring explicit focus).

Also, I really hate the way that motif attempts to lock people into a
single metaphor like windows and mac. These are easy to use because
you are restricted to a single metaphor. But once you get more
experienced it's nice to be able to take the training wheels off.
While an etcha-sketch is even easier to use, people prefer computers
because they are more versatile. Unix and X are useful because they
are versatile. Trying to reduce X to windows or mac, by developing as

We're talking about the focus a windows managed by the window manager, not
fields within a window.  Focus within a window is up to the application.
Motif-compliant applications allow keyboard traversal within the window
(usually with the TAB key).

So the application can ask the window manager to change the focus to
another window?  Someone else has indicated that they built an app that
did this while the window manager was using pointer-focus policy.

This is commonly done using an application-modal keyboard grab so that you
don't have to move the pointer to type in the window.  It can also be 
done via warping the mouse or popping the dialog box up underneath the
pointer.

Lame.  First trash _HIS_ app and then say that Netscape is the only decent
UI?  (As if Netscape were and has always been a perfect app.  Sheesh.)

So what?  Are you just trying to get fvwm to change the default to reduce

Fvwm should come with the

I don't think a specific focus policy belongs in the standard even if we
could agree on one.  If you're using Win95 as an example, why did they
even bother publishing Xmouse if they felt it was a standard that needed
to be enforced?

Scott,

(and the fvwm list; I include this because there may be programmers out
there who see ways to implement what may be worthwhile in what I have to
say.  I will contribute no more to this thread, but I'm trying to be 
constructive in this addition.)

Not to bash anyone or anything like that, but to my feeble understanding,
the dialog boxes you seem to be talking about are graphically disjoint
from the main window.  The features you seem to be favoring include the
dialog boxes logically in the main window focus (presumably a
multi-tasking machine is involved here and one should be able to receive
mail and such things without closing the application of primary interest),
but it should be possible to transfer the focus to another window.  

The ability to type into a dialog box which has snatched the focus from
the main window (we might choose to view it as an appendage of the main
window, attached by virtue of its being really the same application) is
useful.  But the fact that the dialog and main window are separated is
really an artificial thing.  If you have used (for instance) tcl/tk to
generate windows, you know that events calling for input information or
display features can result in either calling up another window or in
extending or otherwise repacking the existing window.  You may pass the 
focus around among the sub-widgets as you please.  The features you
mention seem to treat the dialogs as somehow extensions of the main
window, and you should be able to do the same thing even if they live in 
different windows.

Any implementation of pointer focus which forced each subwindow of an app
to be treated independently of its parent, and on equal footing with any
other window, *could* disable this feature.  I believe that the X wm
standards do not do this.  The X windows standard seems to allow dialogs
to be ignored by the window manager.  Can't you as the programmer
(institutionally) take the input focus which remains with the main window,
and knowing what dialog was requested, feed the input stream to that
dialog?  When you sense the dialog getting explicit focus or the main
window losing it as a result of a user's direct mouse actions, you could
go back to the other way of doing things.  Since the dialog is truly a
child of the parent process, they should have access to the same
information.  There seems to be no necessary conflict with either
click-to-focus or pointer-focus paradigms.

You seem to insist that in pointer-focus mode, there is no way to get the
info for the dialog without transferring focus to the sub-window.  This
seems to be a programming obstacle, not a window manager matter.  Today's
commonly used techniques are not those of a decade ago, and today's
techniques stand about as much a chance of being those of a decade from
now.  Developing programming techniques to handle both pointer- and
click-focus would give you a headstart for tomorrow's work.  It shouldn't
be a great obstacle, unless the program really can't know which window 
has focus.  In which case the standards should maybe be modified.  But 
then again, Scott's first message mentioned an apparent ConfigureNotify 
event failure from fvwm....

<having just sat here and read through all of the posts on this thread...> 

Couple of observations: 

1) The only person even remotely advocating changing the default mouse
focus policy is Mr. Raney. 

2) Most of Mr. Raney's arguments, while being forcefully delivered, do
not apply and are at best moot regarding what is best for "most users." 

3) Being out numbered, I usually recommend a soft-sell approach.  8^) 

That being said, I'll maintain that Fvwm is not, nor should it be, the
window manager for all users.  I would hate to see it become a member of
LCDS (Lowest Common Denominator Software).  If we (Fvwm writers and
contributors) have to be concerned with computer illiterates, then I'll
be forced to go off and write another one.  Elitist?  Maybe.  Truth of
the matter is that most Fvwm users (at my site anyway) tend to be on the
power-user end of the scale.  The first rule in writing any software is
to know your audience. 

Frankly, I don't care what a Mac or Win95 user thinks.  It's not germane
to the discussion.  They're not using Fvwm and I'm not using Micro$oft
Word (or any other M$ product). 

This thread has gone too far.  In the time it has taken me to compose
this note 8 more posts have floated into my mailbox.  Hopefully I have
said what's on the mind of several other readers.  Like Michael
Tiefenback,  I'm now ignoring this thread.  Hopefully it will go away.

Nice attitude! You have a problem and an opinion so you start flaming
others?!?  I would have thought you were attempting to initiate
conversation in a productive forum, not start a "my apps/opinions are more
advanced then your apps/opinions" war.

Hmm, first off all the developers here use xterm based apps extensively so
to them an "environment that works well with xterm windows" is definitely a
priority.

Secondly, I would like to thank the person who mentioned Xmouse.exe.  I
just got it, installed it and played with it; via swithing between several
apps, selecting options that open dialog boxes, etc.

I love it, and will definitely be keeping it!

Now Scott.  Have you checked out Xmouse and how it works?  Bring up an
application (it has focus :), open a dialog box by clicking one of the apps
buttons (what do you know, the dialog box has focus even though the mouse
is on the main windo :), type and press enter (dialog box closes and focus
returns to app WITHOUT moving the mouse :), try another dialog box then
while it is open move the mouse to another apps window (the new app gets
focus :), move the mouse back to the dialog OR the main window of the
dialogs app (the DIALOG box gets focus in BOTH cases :).

This is how pointer focus should work...IMHO.  Now I do not know if the
problem is with your application (MetaCard) or with fvwm (I doubt it, MO)
and I really don't care what the default focus paradigm is (I will change
it if necessary).  BUT if you application doesn't work with my enviroment
the way I think it should (pointer focus compatible) I will find another
application, NOT another window manager.

Merlin.

Neither of these are practical, the first because warping the pointer
violates all GUI style guides (other than the finally obsolete
OpenLook), and the second because it could result in the window
opening partially off screen.

I wasn't trashing his app, in fact it sounds very well implemented.
But I found it strange for him to be citing an app as an example of
how things should be done when it obviously took considerable effort
to make it work like Windows and OS/2 and Motif applications are
*required* to, and have been for years.  If he didn't have to spend so
much time fighting with pointer focus, he could have implemented some
really cool new features instead.

And I certainly wouldn't claim that Netscape is perfect, but it *is*
Motif compliant which can't be said for xterm or most other apps
(including most Tk apps) that X users end up using.

So your position is that all new users should suffer until they become
as experienced as you?  I recommend instead that we make it as easy
for them as possible, and that means making explicit focus the
default.  The fact that it would reduce our (and Netscape's) technical
support demands, while good, is not the primary reason for doing it.

And again, my goal is not to reduce choice, but just to make sure that
the defaults are set such that systems are as easy to use by the most
number of people.  I realize that this would mean that long-term fvwm
users would be getting dragged along by the masses, but it's better
than the masses dumping X-based systems and giving them bad reviews
because they behave unpredictably.  Unless you're perfectly happy with
fvwm's (and X's) very small niche, you should look at the big picture.
All changing the default would mean would be that you'll have to make
one more tweak to the config files to change the focus policy to the
way you like it if you don't like explicit focus.

xmouse is is the "powertoys" package that the Win95 shell team
released.  It's not supported by Microsoft, and there are big
disclaimers all over the README about how you're on your own if you
install it.  Furthermore, a search of Microsoft's site turns up
several bug reports about things that don't work right when you use
it.

Phew, so much traffic, so much misinformation, so much real work to
do, so many hunger pangs.  Well, I'll just dig in and try to remain
calm... :-)

    SR> A reasonable thing to do, but only if you ask the tens of
    SR> millions of Windows and Mac users and billions of non computer
    SR> users to vote too.

Ah, but do Mac and Windows users have a choice?  You can't even ask
such a question if they don't.  Here's one, of all the Windows users
that have tried Xmouse, how many like it and how many don't?  It's
still probably a useless point to argue, unless you really don't care
about selling product to pointer-focus users.
    
    SR> Actually, early research at Apple clearly showed that the
    SR> opposite was more likely to be a problem, usually because a
    SR> dialog opened.  For example, the naive user's first reaction
    SR> when a file selection dialog opens should be to attempt to

I agree so far.
    
    SR> Unless you want to head down the slippery slope of pointer
    SR> warping, this means explicit focus.

Here's where I disagree (details to follow).  And I think this
assertion is the crux of the current flamewar.

    SR> Your confusion was undoubtedly due to the situation where
    SR> you've got multiple xterm windows open, since the opposite
    SR> problem occurs when you've got a modern GUI application (and
    SR> by that I mean one that uses dialogs and palettes).

This is a red herring.  Let's instead talk about multiple disjoint
applications, by which I mean separate processes in the Unix sense
each with their own window, and a single process that can display
multiple windows.  So now we have two situations:

- Switching focus between processes requires the help of the window
  manager.  You can't solve this problem by advocating either focus
  model without focus grabs, pointer warpage, complex IPC's or other
  nasty things.  I don't really see how explicit focus could make
  anybody's life easier (or harder) in this situation.

- Switching focus between windows in a single, multi-window process.
  This can be done under X with pointer-focus policy and no pointer
  warpage or focus grabs.  I have two existance proofs: 1. In XEmacs,
  I can by way of keystrokes, create a bunch of new top-level window
  (i.e. ones whose parent is the FVWM root window).  By another couple
  of keystrokes I can switch focus back and forth between any of these
  windows.  2. In Grail, I can by way of keystrokes, pop up the
  Bookmarks dialog.  By another few keystrokes I can traverse around
  in the bookmarks tree, opening and closing nodes, even triggering
  Grail to visit a URL.  I can popup further top-level windows which
  allow me to change bookmark entries via a little form dialog.  When
  I hit return in the form dialog, my edits are applied and focus
  returns to the bookmark dialog.  I hit return again, my bookmarks
  get saved, the dialog gets withdrawn, and focus returns to my main
  browser window.

  IN NEITHER CASE IS THE POINTER WARPING ONE MILLIMETER!

    SR> It's still amazing to me that people who work primarily with
    SR> the "stone age" version of GUI technology (xterms) have the
    SR> nerve to stand up and say that pointer focus is superior and
    SR> should be the default.

Oh, please.  Come on, admit it, you're trolling!  I'm going to ignore
those snide remarks from now on.

    SR> Well, in *true* pointer focus there is no keyboard traversal
    SR> at all, you have to move the mouse into each field in turn to
    SR> fill out a form. I don't see too many people advocating we go

How do you go from your "*true* pointer focus" to default explicit
focus?  You're completely ignoring the model where pointer location
designates the application that receives keyboard events, and the
application is free to redirect window focus to any top level window
under its control.  This is what XEmacs does.  This is inherent in Tk,
and thus Grail gets it for free (I take no claim for doing anything
more than reading the manpage and playing with some Python code to
understand what's possible :-).

    SR> No, you click on a button (or choose from a menu, or activate
    SR> a menu item with a mnemonic or accelerator) and it opens a
    SR> dialog that gets the focus.  You then type whatever you want
    SR> and then close it by pressing return, upon which the dialog
    SR> closes and focus returns to the application window that had it
    SR> before.

Sounds cool to me.
    
    SR> This is the most standard operating method of modern GUI
    SR> applications, and it just doesn't work very well with pointer
    SR> focus.

I must really be misunderstanding you, because I have no problem with
this in properly written applications using pointer focus.  I really
would like more detail on exactly what you think is the problem.

    Me> and even as separate top level windows pop up and down
    Me> (e.g. to interact with the Bookmarks, History, or File
    Me> dialogs), focus is managed correctly to the subwindows without
    Me> ever having to move the mouse (as long as its one of the
    Me> application's top level windows), even with pointer-focus.

    SR> How, by warping the mouse?

Nope.  Tk has a number of focus management commands and it imposes its
own rational focus management policy on the toolkit.  I won't
reproduce the entire Tk focus.n manpage here, since its free software
and you can get it and read it yourself.  Suffice to say that if I
have a window `.w' I can redirect focus to it with `focus .w' (well I
think I've accurately translated the Python equivalent into Tcl :-).
In Python, if `frame' is a Tkinter.Toplevel instance, then
frame.focus_set() redirects focus into the window.

    SR> XEmacs is a pretty poor example of good UI design IMHO.  It's
    SR> very efficient to work with (we use it here), but if you tried
    SR> to sell it to a Mac or Windows user they'd laugh you right out
    SR> of town.

First, we're not talking about overall UI design, and besides I think
XEmacs is well designed given what the application is.  It (more so
than FSF's Emacs IMHO) is one of the few applications that works
pretty well for novices but adapts to users as they gain their power
through experience.  And second, it sure is funny how many Mac and
Windows users I've heard, who need a such a powerful integrated
programming environment ask for Emacs on their platforms.  Oh well,
that's all tangential to the discussion at hand.

    Me> Nope, its just that not all applications manage active focus
    Me> correctly.  Its one of the main reasons why I can't stand
    Me> Netscape on I hit Meta-O and the dialog that pops up doesn't

    SR> I see, let's take the only decent UI that the vast majority of
    SR> X users have ever used and ruin it because it doesn't work
    SR> well with the environment that works well with xterm windows.

Netscape or MSIE are probably the applications that most inexperienced
computer users are familar with.  I might argue about their decency,
but the specific problem I describe above is not inherent in the focus
policy.  It's either present because the toolkit they use is buggy, or
the application doesn't manage focus properly, or it was an explicit
design decision not to support this, or they just haven't gotten
around to ironing out its use for power users (or all their internal
power users really use Grail instead, but won't tell anybody :-)

    SR> Your argument goes *exactly* to my point: users new to
    SR> computers are much more likely to use Netscape than they are
    SR> to use xterms.  Fvwm should come with the defaults set to take
    SR> this into consideration.

Fvwm has nothing to do with it.  If, when the Open Location dialog was
popped up, Netscape redirected its application's focus to that window,
the problem would be solved.  It *can* be done with pointer-focus
policy, no pointer warping, no server grabs, and no need to pop the
window up under the cursor.  Your application, or toolkit, just has to
provide the right kind of focus management policy.  Maybe that's hard,
but that's an engineering problem, not made impossible by the design
of pointer-focus policy.

    Me> It was nearly trivial for me to add this to Grail, *and* to
    Me> move focus back to the original window when finished
    Me> interacting with the dialog.

    SR> How?

See the explanation above.  Read the Tk manpages.  Read the Tk source
or the XEmacs focus management source.  I encourage you to download
Python, install and Tk and play with it, and see for yourself.  As I
say, I'm not an Xpert so I can't tell you what's happening under the
hood.

    SR> So you're saying that application vendors have no right to
    SR> expect any sort of standardization of desktop environments?
    SR> Hope you like hand building all your applications...

So are you saying users have no right to customize their desktops to
increase their productivity?

Agreed on both points.

Funny.  All I had to do was read the Tk manpages. :-)  Ousterhout did
the fighting for me.  Which is great because I (and the rest of the
Grail team) could implement lots of really cool new features.

    SR> And I certainly wouldn't claim that Netscape is perfect, but
    SR> it *is* Motif compliant which can't be said for xterm or most
    SR> other apps (including most Tk apps) that X users end up using.

All I can say here is that if the Motif toolkit doesn't allow you to
manage focus as flexibly and rationally as the Tk toolkit does, then
either the Motif toolkit implementation is buggy, or the Motif
specification is broken.  I suspect neither is the case, but I have
never written a Motif-toolkit based application so I wouldn't know.
It certainly isn't an inherent property of X, or other X-compatible
toolkits.

Not to say Tk is perfect, but at least for focus management it
provides exactly the abstration you need.

Time to go home.  I'm hungry. :-)

At first I found this whole discussion pretty  annoying, but I have to
complement some of you for some  interesting discussion of this topic.
I hope I am contributing a new viewpoint on this...

We haven't heard from  Chuck, but my guess  is  there is no  way fvwm2
would change its default focus policy.  The "sample.fvwmrc" that comes
with   fvwm2,  already assumes  a default   focus policy  and supplies
overrides of clicktofocus for:

FvwmButtons,  xbiff, Maker,  Appointment,  xcalc, xman,  xvgr, matlab,
xmag, xgraph, sppeed6, and  xmosaic.

Any change to the default  would break every .fvwm2rc  file around.  I
would hope that we would worry more about the existing fvwm2 user base
than some new users.  I think  this viewpoint is more significant than
which policy is the better default.  I, for  one, would feel compelled
to change the   source code before  installation, if   this change was
actually made.

My guess  is   that a  POLITE  request from  the  metacard  people for
metacard  to  be    added to   the  the   clicktofocus   list in   the
"sample.fvwmrc", might be    granted.   Although the arguments    that
metacard should  attempt to  get  their application to   work smoothly
under any focus policy seem pretty compelling.

Good guess.  I don't plan to change the default, although for what
it's worth I actually use ClickToFocus as my focus policy so changing
the default wouldn't bother me in the least.

But I see no compelling arguement to change this default at this
point.  It has been in there since the dawn of fvwm (and into it's
ancestor twm as well, if I remember correctly).  If people don't like
it, they can change it individually.

I worry about both actually, but I definitely don't want to piss off

Certainly.  Just need to know the window classes/resources to use in
the style lines.  And it would be easy for MetaCard to provide this
info as well in the README that Scott said they already supply telling
how to put other window managers into ClickToFocus mode.

I have to agree.  As long as the choice of focus policies is present
(and it is present in pretty much all of the window managers out there
as far as I know)

But, on a related note and partly what Scott's original note dealt
with, I do need to verify that fvwm is handling the 4 input handling
policies correctly according to the ICCCM, which I'm not 100% certain
that it does.

Here is the relevant section from the current ICCCM (thankfully
available online at http://www-ihm.lri.fr/~tronche/gui/x/icccm/):

======================================================================
ICCCM> 4.1.7. Input Focus
ICCCM>
ICCCM> There are four models of input handling:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        No Input - The client never expects keyboard input. An example
ICCCM>        would be xload or another output-only client.
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Passive Input - The client expects keyboard input but never
ICCCM>        explicitly sets the input focus. An example would be a simple
ICCCM>        client with no subwindows, which will accept input in
ICCCM>        PointerRoot mode or when the window manager sets the input
ICCCM>        focus to its top-level window (in click-to-type mode).
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Locally Active Input - The client expects keyboard input and
ICCCM>        explicitly sets the input focus, but it only does so when one
ICCCM>        of its windows already has the focus. An example would be a
ICCCM>        client with subwindows defining various data entry fields that
ICCCM>        uses Next and Prev keys to move the input focus between the
ICCCM>        fields. It does so when its top-level window has acquired the
ICCCM>        focus in PointerRoot mode or when the window manager sets the
ICCCM>        input focus to its top-level window (in click-to-type mode).
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Globally Active Input - The client expects keyboard input and
ICCCM>        explicitly sets the input focus, even when it is in windows the
ICCCM>        client does not own. An example would be a client with a scroll
ICCCM>        bar that wants to allow users to scroll the window without
ICCCM>        disturbing the input focus even if it is in some other
ICCCM>        window. It wants to acquire the input focus when the user
ICCCM>        clicks in the scrolled region but not when the user clicks in
ICCCM>        the scroll bar itself. Thus, it wants to prevent the window
ICCCM>        manager from setting the input focus to any of its windows.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> The four input models and the corresponding values of the input field
ICCCM> and the presence or absence of the WM_TAKE_FOCUS atom in the
ICCCM> WM_PROTOCOLS property are listed in the following table:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>  Input Model     Input Field   WM_TAKE_FOCUS
ICCCM>
ICCCM>  No Input        False         Absent
ICCCM>  Passive         True          Absent
ICCCM>  Locally Active  True          Present
ICCCM>  Globally Active False         Present
ICCCM>
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Passive and Locally Active clients set the input field of WM_HINTS to
ICCCM> True , which indicates that they require window manager assistance in
ICCCM> acquiring the input focus. No Input and Globally Active clients set
ICCCM> the input field to False , which requests that the window manager not
ICCCM> set the input focus to their top-level window.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Clients that use a SetInputFocus request must set the time field to
ICCCM> the timestamp of the event that caused them to make the attempt. This
ICCCM> cannot be a FocusIn event because they do not have timestamps. Clients
ICCCM> may also acquire the focus without a corresponding EnterNotify . Note
ICCCM> that clients must not use CurrentTime in the time field.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Clients using the Globally Active model can only use a SetInputFocus
ICCCM> request to acquire the input focus when they do not already have it on
ICCCM> receipt of one of the following events:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        ButtonPress
ICCCM>        ButtonRelease
ICCCM>        Passive-grabbed KeyPress
ICCCM>        Passive-grabbed KeyRelease
ICCCM>
ICCCM> In general, clients should avoid using passive-grabbed key events for
ICCCM> this purpose, except when they are unavoidable (as, for example, a
ICCCM> selection tool that establishes a passive grab on the keys that cut,
ICCCM> copy, or paste).
ICCCM>
ICCCM> The method by which the user commands the window manager to set the
ICCCM> focus to a window is up to the window manager. For example, clients
ICCCM> cannot determine whether they will see the click that transfers the
ICCCM> focus.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Windows with the atom WM_TAKE_FOCUS in their WM_PROTOCOLS property may
ICCCM> receive a ClientMessage event from the window manager (as described in
ICCCM> section 4.2.8) with WM_TAKE_FOCUS in its data[0] field and a valid
ICCCM> timestamp (i.e. not CurrentTime ) in its data[1] field. If they want
ICCCM> the focus, they should respond with a SetInputFocus request with its
ICCCM> window field set to the window of theirs that last had the input focus
ICCCM> or to their default input window, and the time field set to the
ICCCM> timestamp in the message. For further information, see section 4.2.7.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> A client could receive WM_TAKE_FOCUS when opening from an icon or when
ICCCM> the user has clicked outside the top-level window in an area that
ICCCM> indicates to the window manager that it should assign the focus (for
ICCCM> example, clicking in the headline bar can be used to assign the

ICCCM>
ICCCM> The goal is to support window managers that want to assign the input

ICCCM>
ICCCM> Clients that set the input focus need to decide a value for the
ICCCM> revert-to field of the SetInputFocus request.  This determines the

ICCCM> becomes not viewable. The value can be any of the following:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Parent - In general, clients should use this value when

ICCCM>        subwindow will cause focus to revert to the parent, which is
ICCCM>        probably what you want.
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        PointerRoot - Using this value with a click-to-type focus
ICCCM>        management policy leads to race conditions because the window
ICCCM>        becoming unviewable may coincide with the window manager
ICCCM>        deciding to move the focus elsewhere.
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        None - Using this value causes problems if the window manager
ICCCM>        reparents the window, as most window managers will, and then
ICCCM>        crashes. The input focus will be None , and there will probably
ICCCM>        be no way to change it.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Note that neither PointerRoot nor None is really safe to use.
ICCCM>
ICCCM>                               Convention
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Clients that invoke a SetInputFocus request should set the
ICCCM>        revert-to argument to Parent.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> A convention is also required for clients that want to give up the
ICCCM> input focus. There is no safe value set for them to set the input
ICCCM> focus to; therefore, they should ignore input material.
ICCCM>
ICCCM>                               Convention
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Clients should not give up the input focus of their own
ICCCM>        volition. They should ignore input that they receive instead.
======================================================================

And the corresponding section on how clients should react to these:

======================================================================
ICCCM> 4.2.7. Input Focus
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Clients can request notification that they have the input focus by
ICCCM> selecting for FocusChange events on their top-level windows; they will
ICCCM> receive FocusIn and FocusOut events. Clients that need to set the
ICCCM> input focus to one of their subwindows should not do so unless they
ICCCM> have set WM_TAKE_FOCUS in their WM_PROTOCOLS property and have done
ICCCM> one of the following:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Set the input field of WM_HINTS to True and actually have the
ICCCM>        input focus in one of their top-level windows
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Set the input field of WM_HINTS to False and have received a
ICCCM>        suitable event as described in section 4.1.7
ICCCM>
ICCCM>        Have received a WM_TAKE_FOCUS message as described in section
ICCCM>        4.1.7
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Clients should not warp the pointer in an attempt to transfer the
ICCCM> focus; they should set the focus and leave the pointer alone. For
ICCCM> further information, see section 6.2.
ICCCM>
ICCCM> Once a client satisfies these conditions, it may transfer the focus to
ICCCM> another of its windows by using the SetInputFocus request, which is
ICCCM> defined as follows:
ICCCM>
ICCCM>                SetInputFocus
ICCCM>      focus : WINDOW or PointerRoot or None
ICCCM>  revert-to : { Parent , PointerRoot , None }
ICCCM>       time : TIMESTAMP or CurrentTime
ICCCM>
ICCCM>
ICCCM>                              Conventions
ICCCM>
ICCCM>     1. Clients that use a SetInputFocus request must set the time
ICCCM>        argument to the timestamp of the event that caused them to make
ICCCM>        the attempt. This cannot be a FocusIn event because they do not
ICCCM>        have timestamps. Clients may also acquire the focus without a
ICCCM>        corresponding EnterNotify event.  Clients must not use
ICCCM>        CurrentTime for the time argument.
ICCCM>     2. Clients that use a SetInputFocus request to set the focus to
ICCCM>        one of their windows must set the revert-to field to Parent.
======================================================================

So, if anyone out there has observed any violations of these
conventions that seem to need to be fixed in fvwm, please let me know
the details.

I'm also planning to add focus policy to the info outputted by
FvwmIdent for the next beta, but you can use xprop to figure out what
focus policy a window should have in the meantime.

I probably am the n-th replier to this, but anyway...
Look in the fvwm2 package for a file called 'fvwmrc_convert' or something like
that. It has been written for fvwm2 but as far as I know it will work for
fvwm2-95 too.

greetings,

I'd say that depends on the person, but is probably generally true for
people who tend to be non "power users" of their tools.  But what is
the biggest response to newbie questions?  RTFM.  They may be loath to
do it, but must learn sometime...

SR> I recommend adding a button in the default root menu to change the
SR> focus model

I think this is a good idea.  It shouldn't be too bad to create a
simple menu to configure some simple things like that.  I'll see about
putting one in the next beta.

SR> (CDE and HP's Vue both come with preferences dialogs that allow
SR> you do make this change without reading a manual).

Just as a side note, FvwmConfig (in the extras dir) and The Dotfile
Generator can both be used to configure aspects of fvwm in an
interactive way, although I have to admit that I haven't really even
looked at either. :)  The latter supports fvwm 1.xx as well.

Dan> The "sample.fvwmrc" that comes with fvwm2, already assumes a
Dan> default focus policy and supplies overrides of clicktofocus for:
Dan> FvwmButtons, xbiff, Maker, Appointment, xcalc, xman, xvgr,
Dan> matlab, xmag, xgraph, sppeed6, and xmosaic.

SR> Sounds like apps that work best with explicit focus are actually very
SR> common.  This is evidence that explicit should be the default, and
SR> xterm should have a pointer focus override...

Actually, I believe that the reason Rob put (most of) those in there
is because he never really wanted the focus to go to those while he
was moving the cursor about, particularily with sloppy focus, which I
believe he used.  I think that was also the motivator behind per
window focus policies to begin with.

Dan> Any change to the default would break every .fvwm2rc file around.

>> Probably a safe bet.

SR> Maybe for fvwm 3 ;-)

Perhaps, but isn't that thinking a bit far ahead since I haven't even
managed to get an official version of 2.xx out? ;^)

Dan> My guess is that a POLITE request from the metacard people for
Dan> metacard to be added to the the clicktofocus list in the
Dan> "sample.fvwmrc", might be granted.

SR> The window class name is "MetaCard", but when I tried using the
SR> override it doesn't seem to make things much better.

Hm.  Well, I'll put that in the list anyways.  Do all of your
subwindows have that same class name as well?

SR> It doesn't, and when using the default configuration ("sloppy
SR> focus"?)  MetaCard is basically unusable with fvwm2.  Changing the
SR> default to clickToFocus improves things somewhat, but there are
SR> still serious problems.

Well, according to what you said your app is Globally Active, which is
the one input policy that I was really thinking might not be being
handled correctly.  But I would not have imagined that it could make
any application unusable...

SR> The latest release of fvwm2 actually seems worse in general than
SR> 1.X was.

I assume you mean with respect to MetaCard.  If not, I'd like to know
what you feel the other problems are with it.

>> So, if anyone out there has observed any violations of these

SR> I would be happy to help you work through these, and the problem about
SR> the missing configure notify message when an app raises its menu bar
SR> window.  Here is my original report agains 1.24r, and all of these
SR> problems also exist in 2.0.43:

I do have your original note, but didn't get a chance to reply before
my mailbox got flooded and finding the time to reply to long notes is
difficult sometimes...  I guess I'll reply now.

....
SR> 1) In the explict/click-to-type focus model, clicking in a window
SR> incorrectly automatically moves the keyboard focus to that window.
SR> The focus should remain in the source window until the application
SR> specifically requests it with XSetInputFocus.

Actually, this is true only for Locally & Globally Active windows
(those that have WM_TAKE_FOCUS defined) such as your application.
This is basically the situation that I thought fvwm might not be
handling correctly, although I haven't really investigated it yet.

I'll look the code over before the next beta and see if I can find any
holes.

....
SR> 2) In the pointer focus model, moving the mouse to a window doesn't
SR> always focus that window.  Reproduce by opening the MetaCard
SR> Message Box and moving the mouse back and forth between it an the
SR> Home stack.  Sometimes MetaCard thinks it has the focus (the
SR> cursor flashes in the Message Box) even when it doesn't,
SR> indicating either a missing FocusOut event, or the WM dropping (or
SR> getting confused by) MetaCard's XSetInputFocus call.

This seems a bit odd.  I guess I may actually have to download
MetaCard to check this out, which I was hoping to avoid.

SR> 3) Calling XRaiseWindow does not cause a configureNotify event to be
SR> sent to the application like it does with mwm.

Hm.  Are you sure this is supposed to happen?  I just used xev to
watch the events being sent to a window that I was manually raising
and lowering, and under both fvwm and mwm NEITHER actually showed a
ConfigureNotify event happening (basically just visibiltynotify
events).  Now, I was doing this under xmx, perhaps if I run them
normally...nope - same behavior that way.  I did see ConfigureNotify
events if I moved them though, but not when I raised them.

SR> PS: I had some trouble getting fvwm2 set up and working, due
SR> primarily to the fact that the installation program doesn't
SR> install a system.fvwm2rc file, the fact that you changed the name
SR> of the file yet supply only samples without the "2" in them,

Whoops - forgot to make that symbolic link, like I did with the man
page.  That'll be corrected for the next beta.

SR> the fact that the sample "system.fvwmrc" has "restart" wrong for
SR> fvwm2,

Another thing that slipped by - also will be corrected for the next
beta.  A side note, I'd like to enhance (clean up) Restart so if there
are no parms (or if it's say just a '-') that it will restart using
argv[0], so you don't need to know if it was named fvwm or fvwm2.
I'll try and get this into the next beta as well.

SR> and the fact that both the samples start up a bunch of things that
SR> don't work on the system I installed it on (a Linux 1.2.13 system
SR> (Caldera's)).

That I'd believe.  But they are samples after all and should probably
be customized before being installed at the end site.  Perhaps I
should make a "bare bones" version as well and make that the default,
and spell out what I just said explicitly in the INSTALL file.

Damn, this took way too long to type.  Gotta run!

A new patch which lets one alter their borderstyle is at:

http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/projects/fvwm_patches/fvwm_border_picture.html

If you want textured borders, this should be for you.  Although a
separate patch from the title-bar patch , it *requires* the title-bar
patch (version 6 or greater).  See the new manpage entry for
Borderstyle.  A quick example of how it works is:

Borderstyle Active (Pixmap texture.xpm)

Only Pixmap is available now, but one can also specify Simple to
remove the decoration.  The HiddenHandles style which was present in
the experimental title-bar patch has been removed (pending
reimplementation).

Enjoy,
Andy

I have meta+<key> overrides in my .fvwmrc to do screen-shift stuff. I guess
thats pretty common. 

However I am continually freaked by netscapes insistance on grabbing focus
when I do a "save to disk" form of URL download. That, and the non-grabbing
of focus into input fields on transitional popups. The screen shift META
stuff doesn't work until the mouse is re-shifted off the download info window.

This thing exposes how subjective focus is. Some windows which have little
or no feedback (eg ones with only a cancel button) should not grab focus.

Others, which you explicitly requested with intent of filling in fields should.

Is this an app bug, a runtime wm config bug, or an unrealistic expectation?

I disagree.  The most efficient way to deal with these is to press the
return key to dismiss the dialog.  If they don't get the focus, you
can't do this.

I'd say the latter, if you're expecting some magical way to get around
the limitations of pointer focus when using applications where your
actions can cause dialog boxes to open.

PS: I've just discovered another interesting problem with fvwm that is
just more evidence that most people using it are not using real GUI
applications very much: it doesn't even enforce modal dialog behavior!
Both mwm and olwm have properties that an application sets to indicate
that a window is a modal dialog (e.g., an error message) and the user
must respond to that dialog before continuing to work with the main
window.  MetaCard sets both sets of properties, and fvwm is apparently
not honoring either of them...

  can't do this.
  
I don't think you want to do that on a popup with only one choice of input
(== cancel) if the input is auto-selected true. If its not auto-selected true
then because its grabbed focus and fvwm isn't snarfing the META sequences 
you need a mouse-shift to do normal desktop stuff.

(most downloads last a long time. You really don't want to interact with them
at all)

  I'd say the latter, if you're expecting some magical way to get around
  the limitations of pointer focus when using applications where your

Yea, I kinda knew that.

Robert Nation made this a compile-time option in fvwm 1.x.  I believe the
preprocessor macro he chose was -DMODALITY_IS_EVIL.

Modality is a feature that can almost always be avoided by better programming.
See 6A (O'Reilly's _Motif Programming Manual_), any other decent Motif
programing book, the Motif newsgroups, and the Motif FAQ for more information.

Here's an excerpt from _The Motif Style Guide_, written by the Open Software
Foundation:

             Modal secondary windows prevent the user from
             continuing to work in the existing window from which
             the secondary window was opened.  Only use modal
             windows in rare situations where there are extreme
                                                        ^^^^^^^
             conditions that prevent the user from working in the
             ^^^^^^^^^^
             existing window.  Even though users cannot interact
             with elements within the existing window, they should
             still be able to interact with the existing window
             itself.  As an alternative to providing modal secondary
             windows, use a modeless secondary window and make some
             of the choices in the primary window unavailable.  For
             more information, see Provide Modes when Appropriate.

When I started out with Motif, I thought modality was the best thing since
sliced bread, because I could be lazy.  After more experience, however, I
learned my lesson.  Modality sucks.  You should never force the user to only be
able to use one window.  If you'd like some concrete examples, I have many (as
I was a full-time Motif programmer over the summer).

Don't tell me I'm not using real GUI applications much; don't even tell me I'm
not a GUI programmer.  Are you looking to be flamed accusing people on a window
manager mailing list of not using "real" GUI applications?  Your words reveal
to me at least that you don't even know what "real" GUI applications are.

Correct, but this is not enabled in the default build, and yet fvwm
still doesn't honor the Motif-standard properties.

> Modality is a feature that can almost always be avoided by better programming.

And *almost* is the crucial word here.  Some conditions just have to
be dealt with this way.  Unless you can honestly say that it's *never*
required, then fvwm is broken.

(snip)

And here's a quote from IBM's CUA guide (which is what the Motif and
MS-Windows style guides are based on), page 9:

  Some types of modes are recommended by the user interface.  They are:
  Modal Dialogs

  Sometimes needs information to continue, such as the name of a file
  into which the users want to save something.  When an error occurs,
  users may be required to perform an action before they continue their
  task. 

And while we're on the subject, the Motif style guide specifically
states the explicit focus is the default (Section 2.1).  Apparently
what it says is good enough for your argument, but not good enough for
those who insist the fvwm default be different than the mwm and olwm
defaults.

I agree that modality should be avoided whenever possible.  But this
is not a good reason for having fvwm not honor the request.  After
all, presumably the application developer knows what he or she is
doing, and it's not fvwm's place to prevent them from doing it.  The
result may be loss of data and very unhappy campers.

If you'll take a look at some "real" GUI applications, such as
Netscape, most of the CDE tools, and MetaCard, you'll see that they do
use modal dialogs.  My hunch is that you can cause program crashes and
possibly even data loss with most of these if you intentionally poke
in the main window with fvwm not honoring the applications modality
requirements.  Maybe you'll be lucky enough to never have to create a
modal dialog, but I daresay your reputation as a GUI programmer
wouldn't be done any great good if some application you released
crashed or caused data loss because the window manager didn't work
like it was supposed to.

As a commercial product vendor we have to deal with all levels of
users, and fvwm's lack of support for modality is going to cause them
(and us) problems.

Hmmm. . well, I'll admit that I am ignorant compared to many of the
people who frequent this list when it comes X protocol.  However, by
your own assertion, Netscape uses modal dialogs.  Now, given my
ignorance, I am not sure that I have experienced a modal dialog, but
Would not the Popup that is activated when I selected Options->"General
Preferences" from the pull-downs be a modal dialog?

If it is, then fvwm handles this correctly, because I have used fvwm
1.24 and fvwm2 for about a year and a half and it has ALWAYS behaved the
same; When this dialog is active, I cannot interact whatsoever with the
main window.

Again, My knowledge is limited, but from my minimal understanding, I
have not experienced any problems.  In fact, I use fvwm2 on Linux, AIX,
OSF/1 and HP-UX boxes and I have NEVER had the sorts of problems that
you report.

Personally, I think that fvwm2 is one of the greatest programs ever
developed.  Sure, the source is a bit sloppy and there are bugs, but
fvwm lets me create attractive, functional desktop across any UN*X box
I've used and always maintained an efficient level of memory usage.
Fvwm works the way I like it to, and has outperformed almost every other
window managers I've demo-ed.

But enough preaching. . . back to the point at hand.  Is the dialog box
I mentioned a modal dialog, and if so, what behavior do you observe that
is different from what I get?

- -Alan

As a side-note:  FVWM is not just popular among it's developers and
Linux users.  According to the X11 window manager homepage it is one THE
most popular window manager across UNIX platforms.  If you notice,
according to this page fvwm, fvwm95, and afterstep (all direct
descendants of fvwm1.24r) are way more popular among voters than mwm and
ol(v)wm.

You can review the numbers yourself at:

http://www.emptysky.com/xwinman/

And although the voting was recently reset, the present results are
pretty consistent with the results of the list year and a half or so.

I have implemented CleverPlacement (thanks to Trent Piepho for the name).
CleverPlacement is like SmartPlacement, but instead of falling back to
RandomPlacement or ActivePlacement when it can't find a place to
put the window, CleverPlacement finds the area where there is the least
amount of interference with other windows and places it there.  It
generally puts the window more or less where you would have put it
yourself.

To try it, just replace the standard placement.c with this one:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c
and recompile.

Note that currently, this just replaces SmartPlacement, so you will need
to have the SmartPlacement style in your .fvwmrc file.

I tested this on fvwm-2.0.43, but it should work fine with fvwm95, as I
think the placement code hasn't changed.

I would like to hear about successes or failures.

Tony.

I have three suggestions for fvwm.  I know that I should really
implement them myself, but I have neither the time nor the expertise,
so I can just hope that somebody else like them. :-)

1) A SwallowIcon option for FvwmButtons.  It should work like Swallow,
but iconify the program and swallow the icon.  When clicking on the
icon the program should deiconify, and the button should remain
depressed (or shaded out) until the user iconifies the program again.
Useful for things like the Sun calendar manager, where you want the
program to be running so that it can pop up reminders, and where the
icon displays useful info (the date).

2) A NoFocus Style flag: the program never gets focus, even if you
click on it.  For programs like xload, xbiff and FvwmButtons.

3) A NoIconFocus Style flag: The program don't get focus when
iconified.  Useful for Emacs, which accepts keyboard info even when
iconified.  I have more than once tried to compile a program with 
"ls -l" inserted somewhere :-)

I've been trying hard not to get involved in this discussion, but there seems to
be a rather obvious solution which I currently use.  The only issue is that I
use Fvwm95 and don't know if Fvwm2 (any or all patch levels) has this feature.

Fvwm95 implements focus as a Style element, meaning that it can be set on a
per appliaction basis.  My default Style is to use SloppyFocus, but I have a
number of Styles which override this to use ClickToFocus.  For example, all of
the ever present windows in the background of my desktop: TaskBar, Pager,
Clock, PerfMeter.  That way, if my pointer accidentally ends up over one of
these, it won't disrupt my current focus.  This could easily be applied to be
the focus Style of these so called "true GUI" applications.  (Although included
in my definition of a "true GUI" is full keyboard support.  I rarely pick up
my mouse now.  I've got key support in Fvwm95 to switch between app windows,
between Desk Pages, and between Desks.  And since I'm a software developer, I
spend most of my time in editors and xterms; so it works out perfectly.)  Sure,
this still means that if the mouse wanders out of the ClickToFocus app and into
a SloppyFocus or FocusFollowsMouse window, that window will get focus.  But if
you've already got your hand wrapped around the mouse, how hard could it be to
refocus?

I think what all the discussion on this topic has proven is that "If you can't
please everyone, you've got to please yourself."  Fvwm is flexible enough to
fit most everyone's needs, so maybe the real issue is making it easier to
configure for first time users.  Maybe revisit the dotfile generator or write
a GUI configuration module.  Anyways, being a software developer, I can
sympathize with Chuck in this matter.  Now matter how many great and
all-powerful features you put into your product, users will always take them for
granted and demand even more.  My advice to everyone--and I mean this in the
sincerest way possible--is to take the time to play around what what Fvwm _CAN_
do.  You might be surprised at what you can accomplish.

Of course, this is all IMHO...

I'm going to give it a try, and if it looks good I'll merge it (or a
minor variant) into the next beta as the new SmartPlacement behavior.

I have the mouse binding

Mouse 3 TSIF    A       RaiseLower

in my .fvwm2rc file (2.0.43 in use).  This toggles well for windows in 
MouseFocus, but when I have ClickToFocus set for a window, I get the 
following behavior

Window has focus	click 3 in Title	RaiseLower toggle

Window has no focus	click 3 in Title	Window Raises briefly
						above any windows it
						had been below, then
						drops to bottom.

This seems not to be consistent behavior.  This is my only non-root mouse
3 binding.  This seems to be due to the ClickToFocus generating a Raise
event before evoking the RaiseLower which then drops the window to the
bottom.  I *really* like fvwm, and I don't consider this a real problem,
but neither do I consider it to be proper behavior, as the Raise is not
called out in the manpage as a result of a window-click, at least as far
as I have found.  Is this related to the relatively nasty behavior I see
with some Motif processes (getting a Raise command [dutifully executed]
resulting from a button-click which was issued to call forth a menu in the
window _body_ [note: menus from menubar work properly], thus covering up
the newly created menu)?  And maybe with some configureNotify observations
recently raised along with accompanying clouds of smoke and dust
concerning active focus apps?  Or maybe I didn't RTFM?

Here's a little oddity I just noticed. 
(I believe these are the pertinent lines from the config file:)
EdgeScroll 100 100
EdgeResistance 350 10

If you move a window all the way to the edge of the screen, so that it is
flush against the border without popping across, and then put your mouse
up against the edge of the screen and click as though you were trying to
grab the resize handle, you will instead get a root menu. 
Of course this only works when you are on a border that leads to another
virtual screen. At the Virtual edge, you get a mouse pointer that DOESN'T
pop up a root menu, but instead seems to select the window for moving.

As you will see from the code, the new CleverPlacement can be made to
behave the same as the old SmartPlacement with a flag, so it is possible
to have both behaviors without much difference in code size.  It is up to
you whether you think is is desirable to keep the old behavior.  If not,
then just remove the related code from CleverPlacement().

Eli -

	Whew! A different topic. "For this relief, much thanks."

	This works fine on my system (Linux, AcceleratedX server, fvwm 2.0.43).
I'd be very surprised if fvwm were the culprit here. I would suspect first that
your monitor might be a little out of adjustment: that there is a tiny bit
of screen real estate that doesn't show, and that the window only appears to be
flush against the edge. Could this be the case? I can readily make it happen on
my Mag monitors by playing with the resizing controls.

	When you click, do you see the "I'm-on-the-edge" or "I'm on the corner"
cursors, or the default desktop cursor (perhaps partially obscured)? Or, can
you verify that the x,y coordinates are really at the edge of the screen as
viewed by X & fvwm, not by your eyes? (God, I hope I don't sound condescending!
Been reading too much stuff with an unpleasant tone to it around here lately.)

	Good luck!

If I remember correctly, then FVWM allows you to enable/disable
(system) modal dialogs. This is a very good thing! I just hate modal
dialogs! I cannot image any situation where they would really be
required. This is especially true for system modal dialogs. In most
cases, when applications sport modal dialogs, these have seriously
been getting in my way and they definitly decreased productivity.

In my opinion, modal dialogs show that the application programmer
mis-designed the application and that he does not understand how to
program event-driven GUI interfaces. These are relicts from the past
that should have been removed long ago.

I made a couple of one-liner speed optimizations suggested by Dan
Astoorian to CleverPlacement.  I doubt that anyone will notice anything.
If placement was instantaneous before, it is still instantaneous, but I
suppose that there are extreme cases where placement time could be
measurable (many many windows on slow computer).  In any case, the new
CleverPlacement should be faster than the old SmartPlacement.  It is at:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c

I received a report that CleverPlacement works fine with fvwm95 with only
a header file change.  I have been trying to get the source for the latest
fvwm95, but the home page seems to be down.  Is it still at this location?
http://ltiwww.epfl.ch/~barth/fvwm95.html

There is a bug somewhere in fvwm that sometimes causes it to subtract 1
from the x and y values returned by SmartPlacement/CleverPlacement.  This
bug has been there for a very long time and is unrelated to the new
CleverPlacement code.  If your first window starts at -1,-1 instead of 0,0
then I suggest changing your placement line as follows:

Style "*" SmartPlacement, ActivePlacement

This seems to suppress the bug as far as I can tell.  If you want to
verify that there is a bug, try the two sample.fvwmrc files distributed
with fvwm-2.  One of these files exposes the bug, the other doesn't.  I
started looking for the cause of this bug, which I think is in placement.c
(the part I didn't touch), but the code is so confusing, I gave up. 
Perhaps someone else has an idea. 

Tony.

All I can find in the 2.0.43 source regarding this is the
"MODALITY_IS_EVIL" #define which just changes the properties a Motif
window (I'm not sure why, perhaps it is just to tell the Motif window
that modal enforcement is not supported).

While I'd agree with you that they should be used sparingly, you'll
have even less luck convincing UI designers that they're obsolete than
I've had convincing pointer-focus afficianados that *that's* obsolete
;-) The fact that nearly all apps on MS-Windows and the Mac use modal
dialogs is pretty clear evidence that you're way out on the fringe on
this one.

And from arwild01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu (Alan Wild):

Well Netscape does seem to *partially* do the right thing.  Apparently
they added some internal event-dispatching protection to handle the
case where the window manager doesn't properly handle the modal
request.  Still, it's not totally the right thing because the main
window still gets the focus (the window border changes and the
insertion cursor resumes flashing) and no feedback (beep) is given to
the user to indicate that they can't use the main window when they try
to.

The problem is that apparently there is no support whatsoever for
modal dialogs in fvwm (that I can find, anyway).  The key issue as far
as Motif applications is concerned is that fvwm is not looking at the
"input_mode" member structure stored in the _MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom.
According to the standard include file MwmUtil.h, the _MOTIF_WM_HINTS
atom is a structure with five elements:
    long	flags;
    long	functions;
    long	decorations;
    int		input_mode;
    long	status

In decorations.c, fvwm looks at the "decorations" member, but the
input_mode member isn't used anywhere I can find.  The values of that
member are one of:

/* values for MwmHints.input_mode */
#define MWM_INPUT_MODELESS          0
#define MWM_INPUT_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL 1
#define MWM_INPUT_SYSTEM_MODAL          2
#define MWM_INPUT_FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL    3

If there is support for modal dialogs in fvwm someplace I missed, it
shouldn't be hard to add support for the Motif-standard way of
specifying it.  If there really is no support, things get a little
more complicated, since all places where the focus is assigned to a
window will have to be modified (mwm doesn't allow the focus to go to
a window at all if a modal transient-for window is open, preventing
the user from getting confused by a window getting the focus and yet
not responding to key or mouse presses).  Furthermore, all mouse
buttons need to be grabbed when the mouse is in the window pointed to
by the transient-for prop (mwm beeps when you try to use that window).

There is obviously a *serious* survey bias problem here: I've never
even heard of "afterstep", yet it is the most popular wm on that
list.  The "real world" usage pattern is probably more like 95% mwm
and olwm.  We've only recently started getting bug reports about these
MetaCard/fvwm compatibility problems, despite MetaCard having been
available since 1992.

I think fvwm is a fine tool, and believe that all the popularity it is
acquiring is a Good Thing.  But its growing presence makes it even
more important that it properly support modal dialogs without
requiring apps (or toolkits) to do keyboard or pointer grabs.

There is one more point I should make: this is not just for us as an
application vendor: MetaCard is a GUI *development* tool, which means
that our *customers* are the ones deciding whether or not they need
modal dialogs, not us.  Unless you want to tell all of *them* and all
of *their* customers that it's OK that fvwm does not support modal
dialogs, then we should start figuring out how to implement this
functionality.  While we're willing and able to help fix the "active
focus" problems, I'm afraid that adding support for modal dialogs is
something that's going to require the attention of somebody that knows
fvwm internals very well.

Hi all,

I'm creating a system for cataloging information on ANYTHING(not just
Linux or Fvwm).
The database can be modified by the public, and immedietly updated.

This could be more efficient that Newsgroups or FAQ's for many topics.  

For Linux users(me included) it could mean a very simple way of Finding
solutions to hardware problems, software problems ...

PLEASE try it out with FVWM or anything else, ADD some small bit of
information.(or more)

http://www.donet.com/cgi-bin/dmahurin/notes2html

and give me some feedback.

I think you misunderstand my proposal. There is no need to change the
fvwm source code, just include a sample system.fvwm2rc file with the
following line (uncommented) in it:
Style "*" ClickToFocus

The fact that fvwm2 doesn't even install a system.fvwm2rc file seems
to me to be a significant problem, since the tool is nearly useless
without one (the fact that there isn't even a sample fvwm2rc
configuration file in the distribution is completely baffling to me).
My proposal is just that the fvwm2 "make install" should install a
sample system.fvwm2rc file, and that file should have ClickToFocus
enabled by default.  If you wanted to make the install process a
little smarter, you could even prevent it from overwriting any
system.fvwm2rc file you may have already installed.

An application that opens dialog boxes is a red herring?  I disagree,
I think *that* is the most important class of applications.  If you
think xterms are more important, we'll just have to leave the argument
at that.

As best I remember (or can determine from the Tk documentation) the
focus comand only works with child windows within a toplevel window:
if your application opens a dialog box on a pointer focus system, you
*must* move the mouse into the dialog before you can star using it.

I think this is wrong, at least as I understand pointer focus.  Maybe
you're thinking of sloppy focus or something.  Pointer focus is where
the window with the mouse cursor in it has the keyboard focus.  There
are no exceptions to this rule, and warping the cursor is the only way
an application can ensure that one of its windows gets the focus.

Setting the focus to individual controls in Xt/Motif is as easy as it

Maybe within a dialog window this is true, but since Tk doesn't
support modal dialogs, it's stuck recommending "grabs" as a standard
UI technique (see Chapter 24 of Ousterhout's Tcl book).  You think you
dislike explicit focus and modal dialogs, wait till you experience a
Tk app grabbing the whole server because that's the only way to do
this sort of thing in Tk.

You must be reading some old Tk documentation.  This is certainly not

that shouldn't matter).

This is just not true.  An application can manage focus internally
among its top-level windows, essentially redirecting focus to any of
their top-level windows (and of course to any widget within those
windows), as long as the pointer is in any one of the application's
windows.  I've appended a very simple Python/Tkinter application to
prove it.

Save this code in a file called Focus.py, and run it by typing `python
Focus.py' in your shell.  It will pop up a window with two buttons in
it.  Of course, make sure your FVWM is set up to do
focus-follows-mouse, and put the pointer into this window.  Now, hit
TAB until the `Dialog...' button is highlighted, then hit space.  A
second top-level window will pop up, and focus will be directed into
it.  Notice that FVWM does the Right Thing in that the dialog's border
is highlighted.  Notice further that the pointer has never left the
first window and no grab is in effect.  TAB until the `Done' button is
highlighted, and hit space.  The dialog will withdraw and the first
window will regain focus.

You should check out the latest release of Tk.  I haven't got the
manpages here at home, but I don't think this is true with Tk 4.1.

I stand corrected: an application can do this by calling
XSetInputFocus on the other window without prompting by the WM to do
so (you can do this with MetaCard too by explicitly setting the focus
to a field within a dialog in an openCard or openStack handler).  Mwm
supports this behavior as well.

It should be possible to do this with Xt/Motif too, but I can't find
any Motif applications that work this way, and there are no built-in
Xt or Xm commands to do this, and so I'd guess they're very rare if
they exist at all.  I can't find any reference to this technique in
any of the style guides nor in any of the Motif books we have.	The
ICCCM is pretty vague in this area, other than to state that it's
important that you set the revert_to field correctly lest your app
screw up keyboard focus for all the others.

Thanks for pointing this out.  I don't find it surprising that this
technique isn't very commonly used, however.  Though I can see how it
is useful in getting around one of the major problems with pointer
focus, it has the feel of an unecessary hack to me.  Why should the
app developer have to deal with things at this low of a level?  The WM
should manage the direction of focus to dialogs when they open, and
they all do this correctly automatically if you use explicit focus.

  Regards,
    Scott

Yepp, this was the option that I had been thinking of. I cannot tell,
what difference it makes, because I enabled it ever since I compiled
my first copy of fvwm.

<FLAME MODE>
You see, that is one of the many reasons why I do not use these
environments ;-) I might be able to accept that some people actually
like modal dialogs, but I can see no reason whatsoever why this could
not be made an option. The only exception is, that you accept the
lazyness of the programmer being a valid excuse.
</FLAME MODE>

Although I feel very strong about this topic, it is not intended as
flame-bait. You said, that MetaCard is a developer's tool, thus you
might have some influence on setting policies. I would like to suggest
that your policies consider the needs of all potential
customers/users. Therefore, the ability to configure all "religously"
discussed features of the GUI should be the first and foremost design
criterion! (these topics include: pointer mode, modality, keyboard-
vs. mouse-driven, amount of colors, keyboard layout, ...) Leave the
final decision to the end-user, but provide default settings that you
consider sensible and that are commonly accepted in your target
market.

So far, the only seemingly good argument for modal dialogs appears to
be that they require your immediate attention if there has been a
serious error. The reasoning is, that you could not do anything else
anyways, before answering this dialog, so you might just as well be
forced to answer it. I do not believe this to be true:

Imagine a texteditor; when closing the window the text is supposed to
be autosaved, but a hard-error occurs and the system is unable to
write the file. Writing to a backup file fails just as well, so the
application needs your help and pops up a modal dialog asking you what
to do now. The options are 1) save under another name, 2) forget about
the whole thing and discard the data, 3) mail the file to you so that
you can recover it from your mailbox, 4) return to the main
application; unfortunately, many application programmers forget the
latter, because it complicates the program design.

As a user, I might be able to think of a couple of other options: 1) I
might want to select the entire text and after copying to the
clipboard, paste the contents to a different application, 2) I might
want to use "xv" to get a snapshot of the current window, if only it
was not obstructed by the modal dialog, 3) I want to select print-file
instead, so that I get a hardcopy of my work, 4) I know why this error
occured and I want to select another entry from the main window in
order to fix it, 5) I have to double check a couple of other options
in the main application before I can really decide on which button to
press.

Pro-modality people usually suggest that you could just as well close
the warning dialog and then (hopefully) return to where you left
off. Only 1) this does not work in all situations, 2) it is
counter-intuitive to the way that I work, 3) it might have taken
considerable effort to finally get to this stage where the box popped
up; closing it now would require me to re-do all this work after I
fixed the original error.

You can now find fvwm95 on http://www.terraware.net.  I'm in the middle of
an update (Redhat 3.0.3 -> 4.0) and I don't have most of my personal
data handy.  If you desire, I can post the full URL.

CleverPlacement is now cleverer.  Now CleverPlacement tries more possible
positions when it is looking for the optimum placement.  It is now more
likely to avoid things at the bottom of the screen such as button bars or
a pager.  Also, it tries to completely avoid StaysOnTop windows like the
fvwm95 task bar. 

It is set up so that it will usually avoid StaysOnTop windows completely,
but if it finds that it can save a lot of space elsewhere by covering just
a small portion of a StaysOnTop window, then it will do that.  The
avoidance factor is configurable at compile time so that if you want it to
_always_ (or never) avoid StaysOnTop windows, then you can make it do so.
But I think the default works pretty well.

You can get the source at:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c

Just replace the placement.c that comes with fvwm.  It also works fine
with fvwm95.  To use with fvwm95 all you have to do is comment out a
header file at the top of placement.c and uncomment another.

Let me know if you have any problems.

Tony.

Come on now!  Look at these claims side by side:

(1) Using PointerFocus, the *only* way for a window to get focus is if
    the mouse pointer is in the window.

(2) Using ClickToFocus, the *only* way for a window to get focus is if
    the user clicks on it.

Now, it is very clear that no program I know of obeys rule (2), so why
should any program obey rule (1)?  IMHO, the two rules above exactly
correspond to each other.

I propose that we invent DumbPointerFocus and DumbClickToFocus which
obey rules (1) and (2), respectively, and that we reserve PointerFocus
and ClickToFocus for the obvious improvements on the two rules above.

So far, Scott has been comparing ClickToFocus with DumbPointerFocus,
which just isn't fair.

Please feel free to correct me if you disagree,

I have installed CleverPlacement and it works great for me.
However, and I admit I am not sure if I want to bring this up
because I dont want to start an other discussion on the following
subject, but,

When there is plenty of room, lets say a clean workspace,
the first window is placed at the Top Left corner of the screen.
For me, I like to start with the windows at the Bottom Left corner
and work my way up as I place new windows.

But really, its not important. I see a great improvement as it is.
Especially when I use seyon, first one window always obscured the other
and now everything is accessible.

This is a good point.  The reason why 2) isn't an accurate description
is because the most common way a for a dialog window to get the focus
in an explicit focus environment is for the window manager to give it
the focus automatically (or to tell it to take the focus) when the
window opens.  In pointer-focus mode, they doesn't do this.

It it fair, but only because in ClickToFocus environments the wm is an
active participant in the focus management process, whereas in
pointer-focus environments it is passive and the
*application-developer* is responsible for figuring out where the
focus should go each time a window opens.  Since currently very few
developers do this (and I would guess you'll be in for a long wait if
you're expecting them to change), what you need is a "clever"
pointer-focus mode in which the window manager assigns focus to
dialogs when they open.  The transient-for prop would be one good cue
for the wm to use, with the MwmHints input_mode field being another
(e.g., if the dialog is modal, you *always* want the focus to go to
that window).

> Please feel free to correct me if you disagree,

I guess I don't, except that I think "DumbPointerFocus" mode is a not
a good label for behavior you describe in 1) above.  The fact that
most applications work this way in a pointer focus environment is the
result of the design of those applications and is not determined by
WM settings (which is what is generally meant by wm "modes").

I could equally well consider ClickToFocus window managers broken
because they always give focus to a newly appearing window.  What if I
want to start a program but *don't* want to give the newly appearing
window focus?  No joy, with ClickToFocus.

In a way, that's true.  I guess I must agree with you that you're
comparing Really Existing PointerFocus programs (wm's and other apps)
with Really Existing ClickToFocus programs.  But the applications
should be changed so that they're not so stupid when working with
PointerFocus.  You're writing an application, so you should do
something here.  IMHO.

Hi All,

Has anyone used the "Mouse" option with FvwmButtons
I would like to make a button that brings up an
80x24 xterm with mouse1 click and an 80x64 xterm
with mouse2 click, etc.  The man page I have is
not too clear on this.  I have tried various things
without any luck...

Hi All:

I would like to have my shell resize whenever I do a 
resize of a window with FVWM2.  I know I can use tcsh
and the shell would do this for me, but is there a way
to get this functionality by using fvwm2 to direct
a command to the shell connected to my current xterm?

Just for clairity:

1. Grab corner of xterm, and expand window
2. I must then type "resize" in that window

I would like the second action to be inititated
by FVWM2.  Is this possible, anyone know?

I am not currently subscribed to the list, so can
you copy me "sylvain@ctron.com" on the responses...

Sure. here is the relevant section from my .fvwm2rc file. It is set up
so that the left mouse button opens an 80x25 xterm, the middle button
opens an 160x25
 window, and the right button opens an 80x60 xterm.

Are you trying to say that in ClickToFocus mode a window manager would
automatically give the focus to any window which opens?  You're kidding,
right?  This would drive me completely insane.

I've been staying out of this, but I need to say one thing: this is a
mailing list for FVWM.  I believe that there's an entire newsgroup for
window management issues, and if this isn't FVWM specific then I'd
appreciate everyone saving my bandwidth and moving to a more appropriate
place.  (I host this list.)

Dear Sir,

I am trying to compile FVWM under SunOS. How to replace ''cc'' with
''acc'' or ''gcc''?

Thank you very much!

Hi fvwmrs,
As a newcomer, please forgive any naivety I show here about fvwm2.

I've done a fair bit of hacking on tvtwm. I fixed a few bugs, added colored,
shaped icons, fixed up color map management problems, etc. Basically,\
I know my way around WMs fairly well.

I never really liked fvwm(2). Thought the handles were ugly, can't stand the way it
treats icons (can't tell it where to place them, doesn't line them up properly,
truncates the names, hilites them in strange colors, etc)

But I must have the audio!!! I love it. App based style are brilliant too. A great idea.

So, I've done a couple of things....

(A) I fixed a bug in FvwmAudio.c, so now it plays the right sounds at the right time
    (I'm using the windows Utopia sound scheme - sounds fantastic - don't get me wrong,
    I detest PCs, but the idea of sound schemes is cool - cursor schemes too)

(B) I changed the resize function so that it does opaque resizes. This is great, just like
    opaquemove - when the window gets bigger than the opaque size limit it jumps into 
    rubber band mode, then drops back to opaque again if the window shrinks back down.
    It's fantastic - I highly recommend opaque resize under X.

    As part of this I slightly improved the appearance of the rubber bands - a trivial thing,
    but I didn't like the thicker border on the middle third of each each XOR'd outline
    edge. Have a close look people - it's weird (an artifact of the XOR drawing method used).

(C) I did my own handle/border drawing code. I think it looks great. Nice and simple and very
    functional. Similar to windows 95 (shudder), but better. Basically I eliminated the
    internal shadows/relief drawn on the handles. Easier on the eyes. Less cluttered. Really
    nice. But this is a religious argument of course, so I'm not forcing it on anyone. 
    However I would like to suggest this ... If it hasn't been done already I could remove
    the limit on the number of styles. To facilitate all sorts of handles I would suggest
    that instead of having Handles vs Borders, vs MWMBorders, etc, etc. We could have
    a single handle style argument. Eg HandleStyle fvwm (default), HandleStyle simple (mine)
    HandleStyle MWM, etc. Ultimately, users could define their own handle style. We could let
    them specify internal relief, external relief, etc, independently.

(D) In my fvwm2rc file I have predefined 3 or 4 pixmap title buttons for my favorite apps. 
    So for xterm, button 1 is a mini xterm, etc. It looks fabulous, but I'm limited to
    less than 5 (Button 9 is a catch all, for unspecified apps).
    So I have Style "*" NoButton 1, NoButton 3, NoButton 5, NoButton 7
    and then  Style "xterm" NoButton 9, Button 1 (to change the catch all into the mini-xterm)
    I think it would be good
    if buttons could be specified on a per application basis. If not their function, then 
    at least their appearance. If that's too much, then how about an optional TitleIcon - 
    just like a normal Icon, except it sits in the title bar, first button on the left.


Does anyone like any of these ideas??? If so, let me know. I can post the audio patch, the
opaque resize patch, and my simple borders patch if anyone's interested. But
note that the borders patch redefines MWMBorder to mean my simple borders, so it really
needs to be done in conjunction with extra style capability to be generally useful.

BTW, if you're wondering, my weird? tastes come from using tvtwm (not MS Windows). And yes,
I think tvtwm is a great WM, but it doesn't have the audio. And no, my borders don't just
look like tvtwm - they look better - like a cross b/w tvtwm and fvwm (and yes, a bit similar
to Windows 95)

When resizing an xterm window, your application should receive
SIGWINCH signals telling it about the change. Sometimes, this does not
appear to work; in most cases that is because you run a "telnet" or
"rlogin" session in the window and your network software does not
properly transmit the signal. Try switching between "telnet" and
"rlogin", and check if that makes any difference.

The window manager informs the xterm of the new size.  Xterm sends SIGWINCH
to the shell to inform it that the window size has changed.  It is up to
the shell to pick this up.

FVWM and xterm already collude to provide the necessary functionality, but
if the shell doesn't pay attention then there isn't much you can do about
it.  There is simply no way to know what's happening inside shell, so even
if it was possible to do so, you couldn't just have fvwm "type" a command
to the shell when you change the size.  What if you were running a file
manager, and the "z" in resize triggered mass deletion?  Even in the best
case you'd get garbage spewed into your editor.

I finally found the bug in the fvwm placement code that results in windows
being placed one pixel higher and to the left of where they should be if
RandomPlacement is used (even in combination with SmartPlacement or
CleverPlacement).  Most people probably didn't notice this but it bugged
me for a long time (years) and actually resulted in me writing
CleverPlacement.  The funny thing is that a bug in the old SmartPlacement
counteracted this bug and resulted in the windows being placed correctly
if you used RandomPlacement as the fallback and incorrectly if you used
ActivePlacement.  The change is in the function PlaceWindow() where the
lines
          else
            {
              tmp_win->attr.x = xl - tmp_win->old_bw;
              tmp_win->attr.y = yt - tmp_win->old_bw;
            }
should be changed to:
          else
            {
              tmp_win->attr.x = xl - tmp_win->old_bw + tmp_win->bw;
              tmp_win->attr.y = yt - tmp_win->old_bw + tmp_win->bw;
            }
like they are later in the function in the code for the interactive
placement.  It looks like there is a lot of historical baggage in this
code and it is messier than it should be.  Fortunately I could see the
difference from the interactive placement code.  For fvwm95, the above
change doesn't make any difference because win->bw seems to always be 0.
However in fvwm2, win->bw is usually 0.  For both, win->old_bw is 1.

If anyone knows what win->bw and win->bw_old represent and why they are
sometimes 0, and sometimes 1, I would be interested in hearing.  It looks
like the rest of placement.c could use some serious rewriting as well and
could get smaller and simpler in the process, but I don't want to get too
carried away.

You can get the patched placement.c from:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c

This also includes CleverPlacement (which hasn't changed this time) which
does intelligent placing of windows.

Tony.

 Hi.

  I have redhat-4.0 Linux, with FVWM95 "TheNextLevel" configuration.

  o  GREAT JOB !!!!!!!!!! (Both fvwm and TheNextLevel)

  o  I want colormap to chage to the private one of the window when I do
Next Focus. What do I do ?

      ( I tried to create own function 
              AddToFunc NextFocusAndCrsrMove
              + "I" Next Focus
              + "I" CursorMove 1 2
        but that results in about 1/2 second delay of focus change :
        when I do Alt-Tab (NextFocusAndCrsrMove), it displays the new
        window, moves the cursor, then 1/2 a second does nothing, and then
        puts the focus into the window (title bar goes blue) 

          How do I fix it ? )

aside :

  o  Next / Prev Focus doesn't seem to follow circular pattern :

         I'm in window 1
         Next goes to window 2
         Prev goes to window 1
         Next goes to window 3 !


                 Thanx again for such a great WM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


        TIA,

                      Jan

 Hi.

  I want to place part of the decoration above the upper edge. But XTerm
interprets the "-1" to as offset "HEIGHT-1" or something. So that doesn't
work. How do I do that ? ( the Xterm should have part of decoration behind
the edge *both* on top *and* bottom. )

          Thanx,

                Jan

I'm not sure, but I think it has to do with the borders X can place on a
window.  If you have no window manager you will notice that most windows have
a 1 pixel wide back border around them.  I think that fvwm removes this border
by setting it to 0, because it is just going to draw over it with the fvwm
borders.

*FvwmButtonsBack        LightSlateGray
#*FvwmButtons (2x1, Icon mini-exp.xpm, Action 'PopUp "Start" Start')
*FvwmButtons (25x1, Swallow "FvwmWinList" `FvwmWinList`)
#*FvwmButtons (2x1)       - whatever      Swallow "xclock" xclock
-digital -bg LightSlateGray  -padding 0 &

*FvwmWinListBack LightSlateGray
*FvwmWinListFore Black
*FvwmWinListFont  -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*FvwmWinListAction Click1 Iconify -1, Raise
*FvwmWinListAction Click2 Iconify
*FvwmWinListAction Click3  Popup "Window Ops"
*FvwmWinListUseSkipList
*FvwmWinListUseIconNames
*FvwmWinListGeometry +10

...but that didn't work; buttons merely crashed out while the winlist
process remained but disappeared also. 
Any help would be *much* appreciated!!!

Thanks,

I have a file that I include to more imake files, a sort of template. I'm sorry 
I've forgotten where I got this originally:

#define USE_GCC
 
#ifdef USE_GCC
CC = gcc
CCOPTIONS = -Wall
CDEBUGFLAGS = -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
#endif


just put it at the top of the imake file. your problem is due to the settings in 
the site templete which don't properly provide the define GCC

[this was previously posted to comp.windows.x.apps]

I've just built and installed fvwm-2.0.43 and see some odd symptoms.
The screen initially responds slowly.

    Refresh screen is tangibly slower

    Clicking in an XEmacs scrollbar may scroll twice or more

The strange thing is that if I switch to twm (using the fvwm menu) the
problem goes away.  Furthermore, when I go back to fvwm (using restart
from the twm menu) then the problem stays fixed.  Restarting fvwm by
itself is not adequate to fix the problem.  Subsequent restarts of
fvwm after twm stay fast.  Stopping and then starting fvwm makes it
slow again.

Fvwm is running under IRIX 6.2.  The (default) compile options include
-O2 and -32.  The X server is X11R4.  I'd previously been using fvwm
1.22f without this problem.

I've always thought that a "StaysOnBottom" style would be useful (the evil
opposite of "StaysOnTop").  I usually don't have very many permanent fixtures
on my desktop--I like having all the real estate I can get.  But I do have a
clock and a cpu/disk/load monitor in addition to the FvwmPager that always
reside on my screen.  None of them are important enough to me to warrant those
windows obstructing others, so I would like them to always be on the bottom
of the pile.  Useful?  Not?  Indifferent?  As always, thanks in advance...

  Windows naturally tend to drift to the bottom unless something raises
them.  I assume that the clock and loadmeter are started automatically
when you log in, so all new windows should appear on top of them.  If
you have mouse focus and autoraise then they will of course get
raised, but then you can just make those specific windows
click-to-focus, then they should stay on the bottom.  The only
difference between this and a StaysOnBottom style is that the window
will be on the top when it is created, and when you click on it.  The
latter is normally a Good Thing - otherwise don't click. :-)
  I guess there may be windows that you want to be able to click on
without raising them, but they must be rare (xbiff is the only example
I can think of).  Should such windows be taken care of by a
StaysOnBottom style option, by a NeverFocus style option, or not at
all ?  I don't know.

The StaysOnBottom style would be a potentially useful addition, if only 
for the Smart/CleverPlacement option, which could be instructed to ignore 
the existence of such windows when placing new windows.  Whether this 
essentially cosmetic function is sufficiently useful to justify the 
addition is to be decided....

This would be a one line addition to CleverPlacement, so it is very easy
to support.  I suppose that after the GSFR (Great Style Flag Rewrite) that
it will also be easier to add new style flags.

As I've said before, it's not us we're concerned about, it's the
people that use our product to develop applications for *their*
customers.  You're just dreaming if you seriously expect more than a
small fraction of app developers to go to the extra trouble required
to transfer focus to their dialogs when they're run in a pointer focus
environment.

According to section 5.4 of the Motif style guide, the ability to do
this not only not required, it's not even guaranteed to work in
pointer focus mode.

Must be a lot insane people out there then, because this is the way
all Mac and Windows applications work (disregarding floating palettes
and menus, of course, the former of which are unfortunately not
supported by any X11 WM that I know of).  It is also the way mwm works
in explicit focus mode (which is the default specified in the Motif
style guide).

I disagree with this: the focus policy that should be specified in the
default .fvwm2rc file is an important issue that should be discussed
on this list.  fvwm2's violations of the Motif style guide that I have
reported previously also deserve more complete coverage:

1) windows must autoraise when given the focus (Section 5.2.2)
2) enforcing modal dialog (Section 5.2.2)

Yes there are alot of insane people out there. I for one am so sick and
tired of this stipid "StealFocus" policy on windows95 (even with Xmouse
installed) that I am going to put a real operating system and an intelligent
window manager on this box in the very near future. I will of course let it
dual boot so I can ematize with all those suffering "insane" people out
there. (Besides my kids like the PC games....)

If you really want to be creative I would suggest you allow your code to
accept other religions. You will then be ahead of others if/when your
religion changes under you. (read: religion==window_manaer_of_choice)

I'm currently updating my Fvwm.py module for writing Fvwm 2.0 modules
in Python.  I'm working on a sort of successor to FvwmPager (called
Pypager) which has an interface reminiscent of Ctwm's desktop manager,
but I'm also going to support some of the UI of the existing FvwmPager
program.  I've got the basic mechanism working, and I've been testing
it by interacting with both Pypager and FvwmPager.

I noticed something weird about FvwmPager, and checked out the source
code in modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c:SwitchToDeskAndPage().  My
question is, in the !NON_VIRTUAL clause, there's a call to SendInfo()
that I don't understand.  It says:

      SendInfo(fd,"Desk 0 10000\n",0);

Now, why would FvwmPager be trying to switch to desk 10000?  The
manpage for Fvwm doesn't say anything about special semantics for arg2
of the Desk command, so is this a bug, or a throw back to an earlier
spec, or just something tickling an undocumented, er feature?

This seems kind of bogus to me, and either FvwmPager should be fixed
(i.e. this line removed), or I'll have to kludge around it in Pypager.

Thanks,
-Barry

I just wanted to say that as for issues of autoraise on focus and
enforcing modality...personally, I don't care about those features and
would rather Chuck work on things like installing colormaps to screen
lockers, the Style rewrite, and other bug fixes.

I would also rather see a more specific way to specify app/class names
in the Style command (maybe use regexp and specify whether you're talking
about the class name, icon name, app name, etc.)

It seems to me that the fvwm user-base is not really hot-to-trot about
certain standard features propagated by the major distributors of window
managers.  We've made a choice to use fvwm instead of mwm or something
else, after all.  It doesn't mean we don't want ANY of the features, but I
think we're less concerned with applications being ported from those
other environments to fvwm.

Obviously, changing the default focus policy is _SO_ unimportant to us
that we don't even want Chuck to spend the time necessary to change a few
characters in a file.  Drop it, for christ's sake.

Yep. I for one am an insane Windows user. At least half the time I do
not wish to use the window which has just popped up.

I do not wish to interact with my clock when I start it,
nor for instance my 'xload' windows. They are simply for the
display of information, *not* interaction.

Another reason, is the long delay in loading an application sometimes.
I have often started 'word', and then been asked to do something else.
I would start to do this & then the window for 'word' would finally 
appear, taking focus with it & whatever keys it was typing etc..
[ This is also dangerous if you accidently hit some buttons you shouldn't
have.]

	-mouse

P.S. I'm not sure that I for one particularly care for 'motif' style
guidelines. After all windows has click to front & click to focus,
and I wouldn't use their guidelines for quids.

The discussion I'm seeing has little to do with the default value of
anything and has degenerated into you trying to tell other people what to
do.  I for one am tired of it, but that is my opinion.  I'm considering
killfiling the whole thing because it just isn't interesting to me any
more.

In any case I reiterate my _request_ that you keep the discussion strictly
relevant.  I believe that pointer focus is the default in most TWM
derivatives (it certainly is for the TWM and TVTWM most of my users use),
so you're probably better off complaining in a general group instead of
missing most of the audience.

This solution is a trick to speed the switch times when going from one
desk to a different one. In fact it first switches to the (empty) desk
#10000 and then to the desired new desk.

The time saving comes by the fact that it takes less time to remove the
old windows completely and then displaying the new windows than it takes
to remove old/display new windows interleaved (because removing is not
instantaneous).

At least that's what I _think_ the idea was behind it, if I recall the
discussion with Rob Nation correctly.

Hi all,

due to the long discussion with Scott on the relative merits of
ClickToFocus and FocusFollowsMouse, I tried to turn on ClickToFocus
just to try it out.  I turned of off again after 10 seconds, though,
due to the following problem:

The first click in a window does two things:

(1) it gives the window focus
(2) it is passed on to the application

How do I turn off (2)?  I don't want my Emacs to do strange things
just because I click in it to give it focus!

The behavior for a click in a window should be this:

    If the window has focus already, pass the click on to the
    application.  Otherwise, give focus to the window and forward the
    click to /dev/null.

Also, when I click on the title bar of a window that is below and
doesn't have focus, it is first raised then lowered again.  This
problem could be solved with the same behavior, if Fvwm were to eat
the focus-giving click, the window wouldn't be lowered.

tia,
kai

 hi all,

how can i convince fvwm2 to let me place *all* my windows completely on
my own? i don't want smart, random, clever or any other cool placement,
but activeplacement doesn't work.

thanx,

I sent the following to the list a few days ago:

I would really like to get the Motif window-click menu problem solved, and
Scott Raney's observation about configureNotify events is the most
relevant-sounding bit of info I have heard (although I suspect it would
only lead to the general area in the code from which the bothersome
behavior comes, rather than being from the same cause).  In my problem
instance, the menu click passed on to the app invokes a Raise whether the
window is on top or not, and generally (although in some highly loaded
cases on my Linux box this behavior is not universal, indicating the
generally undesirable existence of a race condition) after the menu has
been invoked.  This problem would persist even with Kai's proposed change. 
The raise event seems to come from the app, and is handled in an
acceptable sequence by mwm and vuewm, but not by fvwm and twm.  Does mwm
really ignore menus (as fvwm seems to do) or does it subtly give them
favored status by keeping them on top?  If fvwm were to handle them with a
StaysOnTop style, then my immediate irritant might go away (leaving a
residual hackish aftertaste).  However, I don't know how to query the
system for window info for a menu, because the focus event required to
bring up the query function causes the menu to go away. 

Why does the ClickToFocus automatically come with a window raise, anyway? 
When I click in a ClickToFocus window which already has focus, it does not
raise.  The only thing I can find related to this is an oblique reference
in the Focus command, where the manpage states that execution of the Focus
command will raise the window "if needed to make it visible."  I presume
this means if any part of it is covered, rather than if no part of it is
visible.  This is too generally useful for finding windows for me to 
suggest changing, but if a non-raising focus alternative were available 
for use by ClickToFocus, it might solve *some* problems.

My apologies if this is overly long...a global tiefen-property, it seems 
at times...

The Motif Window Manager has the properties passButtons and
passSelectButton to enable/disable this feature.  It seems to me like
fvwm should have a similar Style or keyword.

I use ClickToFocus all the time with fvwm and have learned (the hard
way!) to click on an "appropriate" area of a window that I want to
raise.  This is especially important in text editors where I could
possibly lose my cursor position [frown].

You want to specify *both* ActivePlacement *and* DumbPlacement.

Actually this isn't so much a request for change to the window
manager, but for directions on how to set up my .fvwm2rc to give this
function.

What I would like is to not need the mouse to move around on my
desktop.  How could I create something to allow me to rotate through
my windows by pressing something like alt-tab?  There might not be a
way if the windows need to be given an order or something.  I don't
know, and since I am not really a programmer yet, I am just asking if
someone else has set it up and could share their configuration.

An idea for another module though would be something similar to the
iconbox or windowlist that I could have start with a keyboard command
and then be able to use the arrow keys to select the app I want to
move to and press return.  This would be preferable to the above, but
would take programming.  :)

I have the following in .fvwmrc which does this for Alt-j and Alt-k
(vi-like commands...):

Key j           A       4       Next [CurrentDesk] Function GoThere
Key k           A       4       Prev [CurrentDesk] Function GoThere

The built-in window list does this quite nicely.  I use Alt-m:

Key m           A       4       WindowList

Please note that you may have to change the modifier.  On my keyboard,
the Alt key is mod4.  On a PC keyboard, the Alt key is probably Meta,
I guess.

Is there already a new release of fvwm which incorporates
Cleverplacement ? I've missed the patch.

So far CleverPlacement hasn't been included in the official release of
fvwm, but Chuck said that he would look at it and probably include it in
the next release of fvwm.  Until then, you can get the new placement.c
from:
http://www.engr.csulb.edu/~amartin/placement.c
Just replace the original placement.c that comes with fvwm with the new
one, and recompile.

Tony.

Has anybody else had this problem, when logging out of an X session, 
running Fvwm, the FvwmButtons module fails to exit and goes into a race 
condition, taking all the available CPU.

The platform I am running fvwm on is a Digital Alpha 255/233Mhz with 
Digital Unix Version 4 & FVWM version 2.0.43

Is this a known problem?

Regards,

Jonathan

Yep. I posted a patch for it a while ago. Here it is; I'm also including
a similar patch for fvwm itself.

Hello - I just joined this list. I liked FVWM in Linux so I put it on my 
account on an Alpha at work with Win95 as  my X Server. I copied and 
edited my Linux .fvwmrc file. All seems well, except the pager is only 
visible in the upper left most window. Paging seems to work correctly, if 
I use the pager to go to another page and start an application there it 
is there and when I bring up the pager I can see that the app is in the 
correct page. However, the pager is only displayed in the left top page. 
I have to click the right mouse button to bring it up.

Pardon me if this is an idiotic question but it's bugging me. Enclosed is 
my .fvwmrc.

TIA

John Holland

# Auto Place Icons is a nice feature....
# This creates two icon boxes, one on the left side, then one on the
# bottom. Leaves room in the upper left for my clock and xbiff,
# room on the bottom for the Pager.
IconBox -150 90 -5 -140
IconBox 5 -140 -140 -5
#IconBox -70 1 -1 -140

# If you uncomment this, and make sure that the WindowList is bound to
# something, it works pretty much like an icon manager.
#SuppressIcons

# StubbornIcons makes icons de-iconify into their original position on the
# desktop, instead of on the current page.
#StubbornIcons

# With AutoPlacement, icons will normally place themselves underneath active
# windows. This option changes that.
#StubbornIconPlacement

# If you want ALL you icons to follow you around the desktop (Sticky), try
# this
#StickyIcons

########################      MWM EMULATION     #######################
#
# My feeling is that everyone should use MWMDecorHints and MWMFunctionHints,
# since some applications depend on having the window manager respect them

# MWMFunction hints parses the function information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and prohibits use of these functions on the window. Appropriate
# portions of the window decorations are removed.
#MWMFunctionHints

# MWM is kinda picky about what can be done to transients, and it was keeping
# me from iconifying some windows that I like to iconify, so here's an
# over-ride that will allow me to do the operation, even tough the menu
# item is shaded out.
MWMHintOverride

# MWMDecor hints parses the decoration information in the MOTIF_WM_HINTS
# property, and removes these decoratons from the window. This does not affect
# the functions that can be performed via the menus.
MWMDecorHints

# These are affect minor aspects for the look-and-feel.
# Sub-menus placement mwm-style?
 MWMMenus
# mwm-style border reliefs (less deep than default fvwm) ?
 MWMBorders
# Maximize button does mwm-inversion thingy

########################      MISCELLANEOUS STUFF     #######################
# If you don't like the default 150 msec click delay for the complex functions
# change this and uncomment it.
#ClickTime 150

# OpaqueMove has a number (N) attached to it (default 5).
# if the window occupies less than N% of the screen, 
# then opaque move is used. 0 <= N <= 100
OpaqueMove 100

# flip by whole pages on the edge of the screen.
EdgeScroll 100 100

# A modest delay before flipping pages seems to be nice...
# I thresh in a 50 pixel Move-resistance too, just so people
# can try it out.
#EdgeResistance 250 50

# I like to use a large virtual screen and move from page to page with the
# pager.
EdgeResistance 10000 0


########################      WINDOW PLACEMENT     #######################
# RandomPlacement prevents user interaction while placing windows:
# RandomPlacement

# SmartPlacement makes new windows pop-up in blank regions of screen 
# if possible, or falls back to random or interactive placement.
#SmartPlacement

# With SmartPlacement, windows will normally place themselves over icons. 
# Uncomment this to change that.
#StubbornPlacement

# NoPPosition instructs fvwm to ignore the PPosition field in window 
# geometry hints. Emacs annoyingly sets PPosition to (0,0)!

I've installed fvwm 1.23b on a x86 box running Solaris 2.5.  All
seems to be sweetness and light except function keys F1-F12, which
no longer produce the actions found on my AIX 4.1.4 machine running
the same fvwm revision.  

The keys are assigned in my .fvwmrc as follows.  The functions
referenced, e.g. RaiseLower, work as expected when called via
other pop-up menus.

# Keyboard accelerators
Key F1      A   M   Popup "Window Ops"
Key F2      A   M   Popup "Utilities"
Key F3      A   M   RaiseLower

Try using xev to see what keysym they are making.  They might not be 
making F1 and F2 and so on, but Copy, Cut, Help or something.  I'd
also make sure your meta key is really working as meta.

Let's see...firing up the crystal ball....

Operating system:            <...unable to determine...>
Compiler Used:               <...unable to determine...>
Exact text of build results: <...unable to determine...>
Version being used:          _Out of Date_ current is 2.0.43

Oops.  Sorry, I guess my crystal ball just isn't working today.

Less sarcastically, unless you give some (any) idea of what OS you're
running, exactly what you typed and exactly what the machine spit back at
you, including the lines leading up to the error then it's completely
impossible to help you.

	Looks like a version 1 fvwmrc, since it's specifying
StubbornIconPlacement, which seems to have disappeared somewhere along the
way (sigh! I kinda miss that one.)

	For the pager, you might want to specify a pager-specific style. A
popular one is

Style	"Fvwm Pager"	NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky

	Sticky is the key thing to keep it on the screen no matter what page
you're on. The other two minimize the amount of screen real estate it takes
up. If you really want to go minimalist, you can also specify BorderWidth 0.

	Cheers,
	Bob Woodsde

I've been using Tony's CleverPlacement, and it's really great.  So good in
fact, I'd my windows to use it more.  I'd like windows to be "replaced"
when they are deinconified.  As it is now, they appear where they were
before.  Lots of times there is a window there, and CleverPlacement could
find a much better spot to stick it.  This would also lead to another 
function, Tile.  This would just replace all the windows, turning an ugly
heap of windows into a nice tiled arrangement.
