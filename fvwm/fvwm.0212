I've recently started using FvwmScript and have noticed that a couple
fairly simple scripts I've written keep eating memory.  Having no idea
why and not finding any answers in the archives, I thought I'd ask here.
The scripts are available at:

 http://www.jdwhite.org/~jdwhite/FvwmApplet-BattMon
 http://www.jdwhite.org/~jdwhite/FvwmApplet-WLANMon

Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Thank you.

I think that the latest Solaris X has Xrender. Moreover, I do not
think XRender causes performance pbs. When you have to render a png
with an alpha channel you have to know the "image" on which the png
will be applied. Without Xrender under certain condition this leads to
a XGetImage and a XPutImage and this can cause performance pbs.  With
Xrender this is done internally in the server (no communication with
the server).  So XRender speedup things even with an X driver without
special accel for it.

The following may help me:

- can you send me the output of xdpyinfo.

- do you have pbs with the icons/mini-icons provided by GNOME2
applications or/and when you load a png for using it in fvwm (e.g.,
MenuStyle * MenuFace a_png_image)?

Thanks, Olivier

Yes. ChangeTitle leaks was fixed for 2.4.x but I forgot to fix
the Change{Fore,Back}Color was not (and ChangeIcon was only
partially fixed). This will be fixed in 2.4.15. Thanks

There are workarounds.

For FvwmApplet-BattMon create 3 widgets with each the desired color
charging, ac-on, ac-off, then show/hide the widget depending
of the state.

A similar workaround can be used for WLANMon

Hello!

When I for example play a movie and at the same time moving a window
the movie stops, so do the rest of the screen. Everything stops
completely. After I've moved the window to my wanted location
everything works fine again. 
The problem occurs not only when playing movies but all the times I
move something on the screen.

Do I need a special configuration or something?

I'm using the latest stable release of fvwm2 on a NetBSD 1.6 machine.

The following should solve your problem:

  OpaqueMoveSize 200

The outline move, although a bit faster, grabs X, so don't use it
if you run "real-time" updating applications (video, monitors).

   does outline move have to grab X? it seems like most evil thing (in 
context given context:-), turning nice multitasking system into a one 
task dos piece of crap, even  if it's for few moments only (mostly).

   the move could be excusable but the bigger problem is placement of 
new windows - if you have manual placement, the new window (e.g. browser 
popup add) stops the whole system (well, all X programs) from working. 
that's quite nasty. IIRC the placement of new windows always uses 
outline so your workaround wouldn't work. [yes, I know I can disable 
popups:-) that's not the point]

   OT: am I the only one (ignorant of details of X internals:-) wishing 
grabbing the server was not introduced at all?

The reason is mainly backward compatibility.  We could also draw
the wire frame into separate windows and fill it with a pattern
that gives a good contrast.  But we could not have the current
"Xor" effect.

In Windoze, they have "solved" the problem by simply aborting
moving/resizing when a new window appears.  Personally I wonder
why people want manual placement at all.  I think it is a big
nuisance.

Sometimes it can hardly be avoided, but I agree that grabbing the
server for more than a few milliseconds is not such a good idea.
The whole "grabbing" implementation (server, keyboard, mouse) is
flawed and a rich source of problems.  It is definitely overused
in fvwm and probably in many other window managers and
applications too.

Anything is possible, but currently desktop names are only known
to the module FvwmPager.

I can't test this since I'm not at work, Notes/Wine is way to slow for
remote use.

I was able to use C/A arrow with other programs under wine.

Are you letting Fvwm manage the windows?
In $HOME/.wine/config you should have this:

; Allow the window manager to manage created windows
"Managed" = "Y"

I also have a similar situation - I am using Sun's SunPCI software with fvwm and keys such as F1 are consumed by the app when in focus and the fvwm binding is not invoked.  I can't seem to determine what the difference between this window and others are that causes this behavior.  With most other apps if an fvwm binding and application key overlap, the fvwm binding seems to have precedence (such as F-keys in acroread), but this is different.  Additionally, in certain states the SunPCI app does not have a use for F1, in these cases the fvwm binding is invoked.

I would expect the window manager to have the ability to tame these apps, but haven't come across a solution yet.  Does anyone have some insight into why apps seem to behave differently regarding precendence application-specific key bindings and fvwm key bindings?  Any thoughts on forcing precedence to window manager key bindings over application key bindings?

Thanks!

This should not happen anymore in fvwm-2.5.4 or later with key
bindings using the "A"ny context.

  :-) considering how ugly the xor effect looks it funny that it's (part

  yes it is but why wouldn't it use opaque window when given window

  it looks like something in gnome apps is doing it too, after double
click (not sure if it's still a problem but few months ago a double
click in gnome app froze everything (all X programs, I could still
switch to anoth virtual console) for about 10 seconds) - VERY annoying.

It is a matter of which application grabs which key strokes on
which window.  The grab on the highest level window wins the grab.
If applications try to grab on the same window, the first one to
make the request wins.  Normally, applications do not need to grab
keys as they already receive keyboard input in the usual way, but
some super sly programmers seem to believe they do the user a
favour by grabbing certain keys on their windows.  Since the
application is always faster to grab them, the window manager
can not establish the grab on the client window.  To override
that, the WM has to grab the key on a higher level window.

fvwm-2.5.4 and later already have a patch to deal with such
applications.  Bindings with the "A"ny context are grabbed on the
root window:

  Key F1 A n echo got it

It does not work with other contexts, though.

Well, it is considerably faster too and does not cause any redraws
on below windows.  A non grabbing implementation of wire frame
move is about as slow as opaque moving.

It's the choice of the user.  And of course wire frame operations
are still common for resizing.

I'd love to see an (optional) non-blocking resize--OpaqueMove helps for moves, of course, but it's still very annoying when X calls start blocking because I'm resizing a window. :)

Can FVWM be configured to place a transient window centered over its parent?

(I've had no luck with the man page and Google.)

I update my copy of fvwm from cvs , and when I try to install it, i
get the following error.

#rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/fvwm-2.5.6-1.i386.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
        perl(Gtk) is needed by fvwm-2.5.6-1
        perl(Tk) is needed by fvwm-2.5.6-1
        perl(Tk::Dialog) is needed by fvwm-2.5.6-1

I couldn't find appropriate packages for Redhat 8.0

could someone tell me where I can get these packages?
When compiling, FvwmGtk support was disabled.

Regards
Rahul

Yes, I'm letting Fvwm manage Notes/Wine windows.

I'm using Fvwm 2.5.4 with the following bindings for switching
desktops:

Key Left  A    MC   Scroll -100 0
Key Right A    MC   Scroll 100 0

If I do Ctrl-Alt-arrow when Notes/Wine is in focus, occasionally (not
always!) Notes/Wine will believe that Alt was pressed but not
released.  When I return the focus to Notes/Wine, the File menu will
be highlighted in blue as if I'd pressed the Alt key.

Please don't name the release 1, there is no final 2.5.6.
Just leave the default 0.20021203 when doing "make rpm-dist".

Hmm, yet another "smart" mechanism that should be turned off somehow.
These perl packages are fully optional. Anyway, a quick search shows:

  http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/redhat/8.0/i386/Gtk-Perl-0.7008-25.i386.html
  http://ftp.silug.org/pub/kspei/add-ons/redhat/8.0/i386/perl-Tk-804.024-0.i386.rpm

The first is needed for FvwmGtkDebug, the second is really not needed
unless you want to create your own modules in Perl/Tk.

I will upload the official rpms for the latest stable/unstable versions
today/tomorrow. They should not have these dependency problems.

Note, that 2.5.5 is less stable than 2.5.4. At least for me.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yes! That fixed it.  (The ftp server wouldn't let me connect, but the
CVS server did.)

I messed up the version numbers.  The patch is only in 2.5.5, not
2.5.4.

I have downloaded the latest version of FVWM to my pc which runs Windows XP
home edition. I've unpacked it into its various folders but I can't figure
out how to 'compile' it or run it.  Can anyone explain what I need to do?
Thanks

Fvwm is an X Windows window manager.

X Windows is not a flavor of Windows XP.

If you really want to run X Windows applications,
install the Cygwin tools first.  Then you will be able to install Fvwm.

Last night I switched from GNOME 2 (which doesn't work well with FVWM
2.5.4) to a FVWM-only solution.  The only thing I miss is the GNOME
panel.

I've configured FvwmTaskBar to do most of what I want (a few app
launchers on the left, a list of windows, and a clock on the right)
but I'd like to have it swallow a pager and a few mini apps (battery
monitor, mixer, etc.).

Is this possible with the FvwmTaskBar?  I tried using FvwmButtons as
the container instead but it wasn't able to swallow the task bar.

I am not surprised that GNOME2 does not work well with FVWM. I hope
that FVWM 2.6 will work not so bad. However, can you describe the
problem you had?

What about running just the gnome2 panel?

No you should use FvwmIconMan in the place of FvwmTaskBar and add a
(swallowed) clock and move your task bar launchers to some new
FvwmButtons buttons. For others mini apps you should find the good
one's yourself (FvwmButtons can swallow AfterStep and WindowMaker
applets) or you can do it yourself with FvmwScript. There are a mixer
in fvwm-themes (under the script dir) and a FvwmScript battery monitor
has been send recently to this list (~ 1st december, Subject:
FvwmScript scripts eating memory).

Sun may be willing to provide an evaluation copy to whomever among you runs
Solaris (Dan Espen, perhaps?).  Failing that, I am willing to help debug the
problem -- can you recommend a next step?

I've switched my day to  day use to Linux, (sorry  Sun), but I can run
Solaris stuff if needed.  We don't have any Sun raid arrays installed,
I don't know if the rm6 stuff needs hardware.

He might wanna look into litestep for his pc.

It's got a core and modules and is text rc-file driven....and has
documentation that noone reads.

It's a shell, not a wm tho, so it'll control the desktop
but not the actual windows.

I meant in addition to this--OpaqueResize causes a *LOT* of redraws for 
the underlying window (although apparently it's not as bad as I 
remember, e.g. mozilla doesn't seem to have a huge problem with it 
despite oldish CPU--p3 500).

Something in the general direction of a non-XOR frame as was being 
discussed would be nice, but perhaps I can live with OpaqueResize--the 
only app that seems to redraw excessively is xterm, and its redraws are 
only annoying, not slow.

You don't need any array just clicking about button will show the

I think the reason for this is because xterm (and other VTs) measure their
geometry in charcells instead of pixels, so the resize gets "choppy".
Am I correct?

No.  The problem is that many applications redraw themselves way
too often and delete their contents when doing it.  And the
application would have to know at which side it is grabbed to set
the right bit_gravity.

> problem you had?

The problems are mostly with GNOME2, not with FVWM.

I'm using the GNOME2 out of Debian unstable.  First, I couldn't figure
out how to tell GNOME2 to use FVWM instead of sawfish.  I had to
change the x-window-manager symlink to point to my local copy of FVWM
(built from source, since Debian doesn't have the unstable 2.5.x
branch).

Second, my default FVWM config on Debian uses manual placement.  When
GNOME starts up, I have to manually position two panel windows and
Nautilus's desktop window (which forms the active desktop).  If I use
smart placement, both panels get placed near the top of the screen at
about geometry +0+50, the first one obscuring the one underneath.

Third, the deskguide applet shows 4x1 desktops, even though my FVWM
configuration sets DesktopSize 2x1.

> What about running just the gnome2 panel?

I really like some aspects of the GNOME2 panel.  However, it's
unpredictable and misbehaves occasionally in ways I can't reproduce.
For instance, just now when I used the panel's log out button, all my
apps closed but the X server didn't, so I had to Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to
get back to the gdm login screen.  I've never had FVWM fail to exit
when I tell it to.  (fvwm-themes, yes, FVWM itself, no :)

Other times, the GNOME windowlist and pager applets won't display any
FVWM windows.  Now they do, and I haven't deliberately changed
anything to make it work correctly.

Sometimes, the panel starts up at about geometry +0+50, so that I have
to reposition it manually to the top of the screen.  Sometimes it does
start up in the right place without me telling it to.

I've also had the panel get into a weird state.  It would create one
1-pixel-high panel in the upper left corner, one 1-pixel-high panel in
the lower right corner, and one offscreen panel (as evidenced by the
FvwmWinList listing).  That state persisted across reboots.  That
state persisted even when I deleted my ~/.gnome and ~/.gnome2
directories.  Now the panel is back to normal again.  Something I did
between last week and today caused the panel to reset its state, but
since I have no idea how it got fixed, I'm at its mercy if it ever
decides that it wants to misbehave again.

In contrast, FVWM and FvwmButtons are rock-stable and utterly
predictable.  I like FvwmButton's ability to swallow arbitrary apps,
which has worked since the old FVWM 1.x days.  In contrast, when I
upgraded from GNOME1 to GNOME2 all the applets changed and I couldn't
use the ones I was familiar with, including some I'd written myself.

I'll look into FvwmScript.  I looked at the AfterStep and WindowMaker
applets, but they seem to all be 64x64 --- whereas I'm on a laptop
with a small screen and want my panel-workalike to be no more than 24
pixels high.

Thanks,

Great.  What's our next step?  Tomi, do you see a workaround?

Hello list,=20

i am a little bit puzzled what *bar i should take. I search a bar
which contains a TaskList (Like the FvwmTaskBar) and display my
desktops and pages.
At the moment i use FvwmPager and FvwmTaskBar seperately but in=20
my opinion it takes too much space on my desktop :).

Any ideas and/or configuration hints?

Thanks in advance,

-Jason

hi guys, ive made my pager transparent apart from the background of a
selected page, which ive made transparent with a tint of black, and the 
title of the selected desk. 

i know its a nitpick, but is there anyway i can get the title
transparent with black tint? i can set the background tinted easily, but 
not the title :(

heres a screenshot to show what i mean:

http://taviso.decsystem.org/images/linked/pager.png

i can tint the part i've labeled [2] (although its not tinted here), but
not the bit labeled [1], i dont mind the opaque icons, but is there a
way to get a border on them ? 

Thanks!

Hello FVWMers!
I want to use the Next and Prev built-in functions with more then one command.

Key 	P	A	CM	Prev (AcceptsFocus !Iconic) Focus
Key 	N	A	CM	Next (AcceptsFocus !Iconic) Focus

I need a Raise combined a Focus and I __don't__ want to to use 'autoraise on
focus'. Is there a clean way?

Please reply also by eMail because I am __not__ on the list. Thank you.

Greetings,
	Thomas

OK, I've wanted something like this for a while now, so I've
hacked together a little module to do it. It's not too pretty
because fvwm briefly maps the transient before moving it to
the parent window. But it does work.

The module calls an fvwm function with the new coordinates for
the transient, so you can do sort of Aqua-like things like:

  Module FvwmPlaceTransient 50 25

  DestroyFunc PlaceTransient
  AddToFunc PlaceTransient
    + I WindowShade True
    + I Move $0 $1
    + I WindowShade False


I took a quick look at placement.c and it seems like it wouldn't be
too much trouble to put something like this in the core. Maybe as a
style? Then it would be much more slick. Transients could unshade
out of the title bar, for example.

Anyway, the module is at:

  http://cns.georgetown.edu/~ric/software/fvwm/FvwmPlaceTransient.tar.gz

I've not really tested it much, so it's probably full of bugs :-)

Cheers
Ric

I use this:

Key     Tab     A       M       Next (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus) 
CirculateRaise
Key     Tab     A       MS      Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus) 
CirculateRaise

DestroyFunc CirculateRaise
AddToFunc CirculateRaise "I" Focus
+ "I" Raise

Incidentally, does anybody have a way to reorder the windows as far as 
Prev and Next are concerned?  I'd like to have alt-tab reorder the most 
recently used windows to the top of the list (a la win32) because it 
makes it much easier to frequently switch through a few windows.

Hello list,

is it somehow possible to maximize (grow) a window, without changing the
relations of width an height of the window?

Hi!

I still have problems to build fvwm2 from CVS on RH8. I have
autoconf-2.53 installed. This is what happens after a fresh checkout:

[andre@caradhras build]$ cd fvwm/
[andre@caradhras fvwm]$ autoreconf
autoreconf: `aclocal.m4' is created
configure.in: required file `./install-sh' not found
configure.in: required file `./mkinstalldirs' not found
configure.in: required file `./missing' not found
configure.in:71: required file `./config.h.in' not found
bin/Makefile.am: required file `./depcomp' not found
autoreconf: automake failed with exit status: 1
 at /usr/bin/autoreconf line 368
[andre@caradhras fvwm]$ automake --add-missing
configure.in: installing `./install-sh'
configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
configure.in: installing `./missing'
configure.in:71: required file `./config.h.in' not found
bin/Makefile.am: installing `./depcomp'

Um ... any hints? I am not quite in to automake/autoconf, in other
words, I have no clue what could be wrong there. It compiles without
any hassle on redhat 7.x.

Please help, I am still forced to use the native RH gnome thing!

TIA

bet you did not do utils/configure_dev.sh before building?
just run it to generate all those missing files. at least I
think that's what it does.

Bet clearly won. But tell me, where should I know? I always followed the
instrutions on http://fvwm.org/cvs.html. There's nothing like that
metioned.

Thanks for the hint. It looks like it's working now.

I picked it up on the fvwm_workers mailing list. Someone had
said that was the problem. I am not too sure how you're
supposed to know :-) Maybe someone who's more familiar with
this can point that out.

The complete instructions for building from cvs are in

hey,

I'm trying to do:
Style "opera" NoTitle, StartsOnPage 1 0, StickyDesk

but when I start opera the StartsOnPage is ignored.

_but_ If I do:
Style "opera" NoTitle, StartsOnPage 1 0

the StartsOnPage works fine.

(I don't think there are any other relavent .fvwm2rc lines, but I've
posted it to www.uoguelph.ca/~pmcalpin/pub/fvwm/my.fvwm2rc)

For some reason, this Style works fine for emacs and "lower_term"
(just an rxvt sym link).

weirdo... any ideas?

Hi all,

I want to write a FVWMTabs module (think: tabbed xterms, etc.) using Perl.

To do this I'll need to 'swallow' apps into my tabbed app. The FvwmButtons
module does this in C using the XReparentWindow() call. How can I do
something like this in Tk?

Any pointers greatly appreciated.

SCoTT. :)

Hello.

I have found how to specify the number of virtual desktops
in FVWM, using the DeskTopSize command. But I did not
find how to specify the number of multiple disjoint desktops.

Any help?

I don't know the exact answer, I am learning too. Just pointers.

Type in Google "perl/tk swallow", seems like in 1996 it was not possible.
Also type "gtk/perl swallow". GTK+ is a more modern, nicer looking and
better designed widget toolkit than Tk, you may like it. Seems like it
can swallow windows using GtkPlug widget class.

It is also possible to implement X protocol purely in Perl without any
widget toolkits, if you want to try this path, go to perlwm.sf.net.

Mikhael.

There are infinitive number of such desktops including negative numbers
that GotoDesk and MoveToDesk may work with. In practice, EWMH uses only
non-negative numbers, so you may want to follow this too.

To start FvwmPager with 4 desktops (all having DeskTopSize pages) do:

  DeskTopSize 3x2
  FvwmPager 0 3

This means FvwmPager shows desktops 0, 1, 2, 3. Totally 4x3x2 = 24 pages.

Also with 4 visible desktops try these bindings (Ctrl-Alt-8/9):

  Key 8 A CM GotoDesk -1 0 3
  Key 9 A CM GotoDesk +1 0 3

Mikhael.

The "grow" is problematic, since the final size is not known in advance.

Window manager can't know which ratio is acceptable for a window, only an
application may know. There is a standard way to define a window aspect
ratio using window size hints and I know some applications that do this.
If an application (like xterm) does not define a ratio, just resize
increments, a window manager gets it as any geometry ratio is acceptable.

It seems that with the current implementation the final size for windows
that define the aspect ratio is evaluated by growing a window not
shrinking, I am not sure this is good. I.e. If a 640x480 ratio window is
maximized, it is first "resized" to 1280x1024 and then adjusted to
something like 1365x1024. I think it should be 1280x960 instead.

Anyway, there is no currently a way to preserve a size ratio when doing
Maximize grow, ot to specify a user defined ratio if an application did
not provide one. If you know programming you may try to implement a new
Maximize aspectgrow option or write a module to constrain window sizes
using user-defined aspect ratios.

Mikhael.

Seems like the pager titles are not completely converted to colorsets.
Only fg and bg from HilightColorset are currently used for titles.

There were also several requests to separate title colors from page
hilight colors. Maybe someone will have a time to add a new TitleColorset
option to FvwmPager to apply all (non just fg/bg) colorset properties
to titles, it may default like now to fg and bg from HilightColorset.

Do you mean a 16x16 (well, 18x18) border around transparent mini icons or
something else?

You may tint non-transparent parts of mini icons using IconTint or
IconAlpha in FvwmPager's WindowColorsets.

Several ideas. You may use transient pager to save your desktop space.
Here are bindings from fvwm-themes (press Ctrl-Mouse2 on the root):

  Mouse 2  R  C   Module FvwmPager -transient FvwmPager-Single * *
  Mouse 2  R  SC  Module FvwmPager -transient FvwmPager-Desker 0 3

You may also have FvwmPager to be an expanding/collapsing subpanel of
some FvwmButtons panel.

Another way is to swallow both FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan in FvwmButtons.

There are examples of all of these in fvwm-themes.

In my opinion FvwmPager is too valuable on a busy desktop to be hidden.
Try also something like this for a windows sorting in 2.5.4+:

  Mouse 2  A  SM  WindowList SelectOnRelease "" SortByResource, NoDeskSort, NoCurrentDeskTitle, NoGeometry, NoHotkeys

Mikhael.

According to the FVWM FAQ, nobody knows. Not so! I know!

See the attached fvwm.c from the FVWM 0.5 sources. Lines 34 and 77 might
 be of particular interest.

Hope this clears up the mystery.

Fixed.

I have renamed all the StickyPage/StickyDesk stuff to
StickyAcrossPages/StickyAcross desks, so you have to adapt your
config.

Isn't there an interview with the original author in UnixWorld (or 
something like it; I'm too lazy to look it up) where he gives the

According to an article by FVWM's author (I can't recall where I read =
it),
it stands for "Feline Virtual Windows Manager". It might have been on
=46VWM's official page:

I upgraded to FVWM 2.5.5 and I still have problems with FVWM passing
through Ctrl/Alt to Notes under Wine.  I'm using these keybindings:

Key e     A    SC   shade-and-raise
Key Left  A    MC   Scroll -100 0

When I use one of these key combinations when Notes is in focus, Notes
sometimes acts as if Control, Shift, or Alt has been pressed but not
released.  For example, typing 'o' might bring up the "Open Database"
dialog, which is normally accessed via the Ctrl-o combination.

Actually, "we" (an undefined set of developers and mailing list
readers) know what the F stood for originally, but most of "us"
prfer the "mystery F" instead.  The "Feline" VWM came up several
years ago when we noticed that almost all developers had cats ^_^

Does it matter wherher you start fvwm first or the application?
Do *any* key bindings work over this window?

Uh, so ``you'' (undefined set &c., &c.) are going to keep ``us''
(definite set of people who want to know) in suspense about the original
meaning (for an indefinite length of time)?  If so, does filing a false
bug report (#961) count (by any stretch of the imagination) as being
part of the aforementioned set of developers and thus privy to the
original meaning of F?

I want to use a pixmap file in a button and the size of
button is fixed.
However the icon is a little bigger so only a part of it can
be show on the button.
Then how to zoom it ?
Thank you for your help.

I suppose you speak about "ButtonStyle n Pixmap /your/image.xpm"
and not "ButtonStyle n MiniIcon".

1) You may enlarge the TitleStyle Height value for the image to fit.

2) You may zoom and save the image using gimp or other image editor.

3) In recent 2.5.5+ you may zoom an image if you use colorsets.

  Colorset 9 AspectPixmap /your/image.png
  ButtonStyle 7 Colorset 9

  # these 2 are not needed for you, just to make button 7 visible
  Style * Button 7
  Mouse 1 7 A Iconify

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello.

Starting of applications seems to not be working as expected in my
FVWM 2.5.5 configuration.

In order to have Eterm started once (at initialization time) and
FvwmButtons on initialization and restart times, I have the
following

	AddToFunc InitFunction
	+	"I" exec Eterm
=09
	AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmButtons

in my ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc configuration file. When FVWM is started,
none of Eterm and FvwmButtons is shown, until I press a mouse
button (if anywhere in the screen, only the Eterm appears, if in
any window client area, both appear).

Any clues?

First, ignore that advice about using "Exec" instead of "exec".
Fvwm commands are not case sensitive.

If you are getting a delay until you press a button, most
likely you have a command in your .fvwm2rc that needs a target
window.  Fvwm is waiting for you to indicate which window you want
the command to operate on.

For example, if you had the command:

Move

in your .fvwm2rc, fvwm wouldn't know which window you want to
move and it would wait until you clicked somewhere
to indicate which window to move.  (If you click on the root,
it just aborts the command.)

Look for a command in your .fvwm2rc that needs a window.

If you can't find anything, post your .fvwm2rc here.

I always start fvwm first (from gnome-session).  Do you think that
starting Notes first and then fvwm later will change anything?

Both the keybindings *work* as advertised.  The problem is that in
*addition*, Notes sees a Control or Alt keypress but not a corresponding
keyrelease event.

I see it, but I don't know what Fvwm can do about it.

Notes is taking the Alt key as a keystroke.
Fvwm needs Alt plus another key before it thinks the keystroke
is for Fvwm.

If you do a binding like this:

Key Alt_L W N Move

Then Fvwm will get the keystoke, but I don't think thats
what you want.  You want to use the Alt key as a modifier.

You can change the Alt key so that its a different modiifer
(like mod 1), but that will affect any program that wants Alt.
Most keyboards do have 2 alt keys,  I see notes uses both of
them.  You might want to remap one of them to a different
modifier.

I found an archive 0.91, from 23 July 1993...
http://www.update.uu.se/~ml/fvwm-0.91b.tar.gz

You might have to tweak the path for libraries to get it to compile (I
had to) (it has no autoconf :-) )

Thanks for the help. In fact there was a wrong command
in my .fvwm2rc configuration file: there was a
AddToFunction instead of an AddToFunc command:

	AddToFunc SelectWindow
	+ I Focus
	+ I Iconify false
	+ I Raise

With the wrong AddToFunction command, it seems that
FVWM was executing the other three lines, which made
it wait for a mouse click.

It feels so good when I guess right...

Probably it was adding those commands to InitFunction or
StartFunction which would cause a hang.

Hi all,

My Perl/Tk FvwmTabs module works great!

I'm trying to run it on another OS but I think there's a problem
with FVWM::Module.

I was able to run the demo 'module-tkdesker' successfully on my
Redhat 7.3 box, but when I run it on a Redhat 7.1 box I get this error:

Can't call method "_win_id" without a package or object reference at /tmp/module-tkdesker line 53.

This is a similar error to what I'm getting in my FvwmTabs code.

'perl -v' yields '5.6.1' on RH7.3 & '5.6.0' on RH7.1 ... could that be
important?

On both machines I'm running fvwm-2.5.4.

Any advice/pointers greatly appreciated.

SCoTT. :)

Thank you for your help :)
I want to use image in the buttons of module FvwmButtons,
not in the topbar of windows.
I configured the FvwmButtons like following:
=20
      Font        5x7
      Back rgb:90/80/90
      Fore        black
      Frame       1
      # 15x15 pixels per button, 4x4 pixels for the frame
      Geometry    904x49+0-0
      Rows        3
      Columns     60
      BoxSize     fixed
      Padding     1 1
      =20
      # first row of buttons from left to right:
     (2x2+0+0, Icon mozillasmall.xpm, Action `Exec mozilla`)
     (2x2+2+0, Icon rxvt.xpm, Action `Exec exec rxvt`)
     ............

But rxvt.xpm is too bigger to show on the 2x2 button.
Some other xpm impages are also too bigger.=20
Of course, I can zoom and save the image using gimp.
But I am too lazy to do it for every big image :)
Is there other way to solve it?

Is there a way to cause a window to unshade when the mouse is hovered
over the title bar?  Also, if there is, is there a way to cause the
window to re-shade when focus is lost?

Hi,

I'm fairly new to FVWM, (only been using it about a week now) and I was
wondering how this group feels about the stability and usability of the 2.5.x
version in comparison to the 2.4.x version.  Are there a lot of incomplete
features?  Does it seem much less stable than 2.4.x?  Are the new features
documented anywhere?

So far, I love FVWM.  It's been a lot to learn, but it's definitely been worth
it.  =0)

Jeremy

Yes, there are so many key, mouse and reset buttons out there
that you should be more specific.

There is no currently way to zoom FvwmButtons Icon image internally.
You may zoom an image specified in the buttons Pixmap or Colorset
(with Pixmap or AspectPixmap). It is auto-zoomed when resized too.

The first 2 links on the home page (after the download) describe all new
features.

I don't want to discuss the 2.5.x stability. It may be rock stable for
your specific configuration that you don't change while running and may
work buggy or even dump core with other configurations.

Fine, new users are welcome.

I think I am about your fvwm-skill-level, even though I've
been using fvwm for a while, so I'll offer my opinions :)

I've heard some people refer to instabilities in 2.5.x
series once in a while. However, my config is pretty
basic, and I haven't seen problems so far - mostly due to me
misunderstanding the way things should be configured. I dont
know what the *official policy* on encouraging people to try
2.5.x is.

If you look in cvs, "NEWS" file is the one that describes
the improvements. 

You can also find that file online:
               
               http://www.fvwm.org/generated/NEWS.html

(I am not sure if it's lagging couple of days behind the cvs
version, but I haven't noticed). I think between this file,
someone's sample config, and man pages, you are usually able
to figure out how things work :-)

As far as improvements: I *think* the following are not in
the 2.4.x, but I could be wrong. Love colorsets, transparent
pager, and antialiased fonts. At least I think antialiasing
makes a difference - maybe its just the fact that it should
be there + my mind playing games with me ;-) I think alt-tab
behavior has been tweaked to allow for "the other os"-like
behavior (CurrentAtEnd). 

There is much more to what's been updated/added/improved,
but these are just some things I use.

I dont lurk on fvwm-workers much (lack of time), but that's
where people talk about cvs versions and features, problems,
etc. Perhaps if you want to get a feel for what's going on,
you should listen in? 

Anyway, that's how I feel about 2.5.x. Good luck.

With SloppyFocus, put this your in menus or StartFunction:

  FvwmAuto 200 "Silent WindowShade off" "Silent WindowShade on"

Although this does exactly what you want and kind of fancy,
I am not sure this is very usable.

  KillModule FvwmAuto

I write it to be 5.004 compatible, but only 5.00503, 5.6.0 and 5.8.0
are tested for now.

Seems like you have several fvwm installations and the one in your $PATH
is 2.5.2 or 2.5.3. What does "fvwm-perllib --version" say?

Yeah, it's been lots of fun. You would not believe how many windows
I've unmapped, lost & had disappear into the window manager void
forever ... never to be recovered! :)

It's like dark matter - you know it's there but you can't see it!

Ah, that's it! Just needed to make sure I got the right 'fvwm-perllib'.

Thanks so much.

Hi all,

You can try out FvwmTabs if you like:

http://users.tpg.com.au/users/scottie7/fvwmtabs.html

It only has very basic functionality at the moment but it
sure unclutters your desktop.

SCoTT. :)

Normal time is a few minutes.

Something is wrong with your compiler setup.

What OS are you on?

Where are cpp and gcc?  (Type "which gcc", "which cpp".

It sounds like you have a shell of some sort set up to invoke cpp
and the shell is reinvoking itself.

Hello everyone,

A few days ago I moved from gnome+sawfish to fvwm (2.4.14 on a redhat 
box), mainly because of the speed (IMO gnome was a bit slow on a 450MHz 
CPU). I like it a lot, especially the freedom to configure everything 
you want in two text files (.xinitrc and .fvwm2rc).

The basic look+feel, nor any of the themes out there is 100% to my 
liking, so I'm trying to roll my own .fvwm2rc. The samples on the web 
the FAQ etc. are very helpful, but I'm wondering if a list exists with 
an explanation of all settings and commands (Style, AddToFunc, Key 
etc.).

TIA for any pointers!

Normal time is a few minutes.

Something is wrong with your compiler setup.

What OS are you on?

Where are cpp and gcc?  (Type "which gcc", "which cpp".

It sounds like you have a shell of some sort set up to invoke cpp
and the shell is reinvoking itself.

The Fvwm man page is the definitive reference:

man fvwm2

The man page is really large.  Its best to read it on the web
or inside of emacs or some other web page browswer.

For the web copy go to http://www.fvwm.org

Hmm.  The version of gcc I have installed on Solaris doesn't
put cpp in my path.  What version of gcc is this?  Type:

gcc --version

(mine prints 2.8.1).

Also type:

file /export/gnu-1.2/bin/cpp

If its a shell, and resonably sized, post it.

Thanks Dan. Glyn Millington already mailed me about the manpage and I 
did a man2html. I had no idea the manpage would be this huge :-) Great 
reference!

Please decide what you want, should it automatically shade on or not?
This makes more sense for me:

  FvwmAuto 300 "ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade off"

It is possible to program some more complex logic (once you define it)
using user states in 2.5.x. Also use delay 0 if you intend to mix quick
manual shading with automatical unshading.

Mikhael.

He wants to shade only windows that were previously unshaded when
they received focus.  Try this one (but personally I hate that).

  AddToFunc funky_shade
  + I WindowId $[funky_shade_w] (!shaded) WindowShade on

  AddToFunc funky_unshade
  + I funky_shade
  + I UnsetEnv funky_shade_w
  + I ThisWindow (shaded) SetEnv funky_shade_w $w
  + I WindowShade off

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I UnsetEnv funky_shade_w
  + I FvwmAuto 300 "Silent funky_unshade" "Silent funky_shade"

Maybe it could be done better with using the internal window
states to remember which windows want to be (un)shaded.

Maybe the default .fvwm2rc that comes w/ fvwm should have EVERY command in it (and a one liner of its purpose.

People can then delete/switch what they dont want.
It's easier to see what to delete than to see what to add.

That would be pretty hard.  There are a lot of commands, style
options, and modules.  Some of them are contradictory, for example
if you use FvwmIcon, you should set Style NoIcon, so all the
icon related stuff doesn't apply.

> People can then delete/switch what they dont want.

There is no single default configuration.  There are 2 different
automatically generated setups and a few different sample files.
Theres the official Fvwm Themes, and I think a couple of other
themes thingies, and theres the setup you find in some of the
distributions.

This subject keeps coming up, (sometimes is comes up as
"fvwm needs a tutorial").

Face it, the joy of Fvwm is searching thru the man pages and
finding the option you need and inserting into your config file
with an editor.

Most of the commands are dynamical and/or contextual, so dumping them all
without a context would be very silly. Also some of the commands have
dozens of options, that are pretty opposite.

In the mean time, take a look at:

  ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/sources/docs/COMMANDS

If you are good at writting short and intuitive descriptions feel free to
complete them using the man page, I don't have a time to do this right now.

Hi everyone!

When you change a setting in the .fvwm2rc file, how do you see the 
changes in the desktop without  resetting the computer?

Thank you!

Yes, turning electricity in the room off and then on is one of the ways.
But there is a faster way using the

  Restart

command that is bound to a menu or key/mouse press.

Or, if your .fvwm2rc is written to support this, by executing:

  Read .fvwm2rc

You may also see the changes immediatelly if you execute the commands in
FvwmConsole (see its man page). These changes are not stored in .fvwm2rc,
so you may do this separately.

Mikhael.

It would be handy if you could have more than one instance of FvwmTabs

Agreed. Ideally I think the user should select 'Add' from the
FvwmTabs window when they want to add an existing window. When this
happens, FvwmTabs needs some way to ask FVWM to get the user to select
a window & have it pass back the window Id. That'd work nice - that
way you can have as many FvwmTabs running as you like.

I haven't worked out how to control FVWM (from a module) to select a
window with a mouse-click though - anyone?

SCoTT. :)

Perfect!  Thanks for all those that replied!

Oh, and I understand that there are those that detest this sort of
function.  Myself, I only use it on xcalc and other small,
often-needed-but-usually-in-the-way applets.

Command/prefix Pick is used to select a window and execute command in the
selected window context or not execute if window selection is canceled.

If there is master FvwmTabs and several aliases, you may do the following.
To create a new tab from the master, send this or similar command:

  Pick Module FvwmTabs FvwmTabs-3  # starts a new module with a new window

or (depending on implementation):

  Pick SendToModule FvwmTabs createnew

The last may send "FvwmTabs FvwmTabs-3" in the received window context.
To add a to-be-selected window to an existing tab, this tab may send:

  Pick SendToModule FvwmTabs-3 addme

BTW, there was a reply on fvwm-workers list and I think you are not
subscribed to it. I agree that such things belong more to a developer
list.

Hi,

I've been beating my head on this one for over
a day. I'm hoping I'm just clueless and that
there's a simple way:

I have an already created window named "window 2"
(in this case it's an xterm, but also want this
for my mozilla browser, mail windows, etc.)

I'd like to map a function key, say F2, to
raise/focus/warpto said "window 2".

I've been trying things like:

AddToFunc   FuncWindowTest
        + I WindowId window2 Focus
        + I WindowId window2 Raise
        + I WindowId window2 WarpToWindow 50 50

Key F2 A N FuncWindowTest

But no dice. Is there a way?

Thanks for your help.

(p.s. Please email direct to me, since
I'm not subscribed to any fvwm lists.)

WindowId operates on ids that X gives to windows, these are very big
random numbers that you don't usually know. You only want to execute
WindowId on constructed ids, like $0, $w or $[my_previously_stored_id]
and not on some known in advance value.

So WindowId will not do you good here. What you need is the Next command.

  DestroyFunc FuncWindowTest
  AddToFunc   FuncWindowTest
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

  Next ("Mozila*") FuncWindowTest

You may want to specify some options for Next, like:

  Next (Mozilla, !Iconic) FuncWindowTest
  Next (AllowFocus) Focus
  Next (XTerm, !Shaded) WindowShade

If you really want to see how WindowId may be useful here is an obfuscated
and redundant way of doing the same as the above:

  DestroyFunc FuncWindowTest
  AddToFunc   FuncWindowTest
  + I WindowId $0 Focus
  + I WindowId $0 Raise
  + I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

  Next ("Mozila*") FuncWindowTest $w     # it should be $$w to be sure

In your specific case you may reuse one existing function, but I don't
want to suggest this (since this function may be changed), write your own.

Regards,
Mikhael.

For what it's worth, here's what I did 2 weeks ago...

AddToFunc       MyWarp I Raise
                + I WarpToWindow 50 50

Key     Tab     A       M       Next (AcceptsFocus !Iconic) MyWarp

Explaination: instead of the windowlist, I can now navigate through all
non iconified apps on the current desk with Alt-Tab (I'm in follow focus).
The neat part is the warptowindow to be at the center of the window.

Now the cool part: when I'm prompted for a passwd in mozilla for example,
a simple Alt-Tab immediately warps to the latest created window. No mouse
needed ;)

To launch rather simple and quick emacs, xterm, lynx
and calctool I edited /etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc
in this manner:


# Section: Key bindings

#Key F5    A    M    Prev
#Key F6    A    M    Next
Key F5    A    M    exec calctool &   #<-------edited
Key F6    A    M    lynx              #<-------edited
Key F7    A    M    Move
Key F8    A    M    exec xterm &      #<-------edited
Key F9    A    M    Iconify
Key F10   A    M    Maximize 100 100
Key F11   A    M    Raise
#Key F12   A    M    Stick
Key F12   A    M    exec emacs -nw &  #<-------edited




DestroyMenu Window-Ops
AddToMenu Window-Ops "Alt-F1: Window Ops" Title

#+ "Alt-F5:  Previous"               Prev
+ "Alt-F5:  Calculator"              exec calctool & #<-------edited
#+ "Alt-F6:  Next"                   Next
+ "Alt-F6:  lynx"                    lynx &          #<-------edited
+ "Alt-F7:  Move"                    Move
+ "Alt-F8:  xterm"                   exec xterm &    #<-------edited
+ "Alt-F9:  (De)Iconify"             Iconify
+ "Alt-F10: (Un)Maximize to screen"  Maximize 100 100
+ "Alt-F11: Raise"                   Raise
#+ "Alt-F12: (Un)Stick"              Stick        
+ "Alt-F12: emacs -nw"               exec emacs -nw & #<-------edited


Yet only calctool and xterm want to launch, lynx and emacs
alltogether refuse in menu and keybindings although they
can be started by command in a xterm.

Could someone kindly explain this rather strange behaviour?

This is wrong.  You need "exec lynx &".  You can not simply put
shell commands in a menu, they must be prefixed with the "exec"
fvwm command.

> + "Alt-F12: emacs -nw"               exec emacs -nw & #<-------edited

Check for some error message in the X console.  Is the PATH set
correctly?

emacs -nw is emacs without an X windows GUI.  It needs to run in
an xterm, as in:

exec xterm -e emacs -nw

Actually I would like to use the mouse as rarely as I can.
To get the focus on a window M+tab helps, but after some
desired action - usually maximizing - the window loses
imediatly the focus and I have to M+tab back again.

Is this a general fvwm or windowmanager issue?

Thank you very much, this actually was what I had missed
beside the silly mistake forgetting exec (in a xterm aswell)
for the lynx browser.

What are the following key bindings defined in
system.fvwm2rc for:

Key F5    A    M    Prev
Key F6    A    M    Next


Using these keys does not seem to result in any
behaviour (I thought it would be a alternative
to M+tab and MS+tab).

What is the 3rd column in the pasted lines for?
The manual declares 'A' would be 'any key' but
this does not make sense to me.

You have to ask the person who wrote these lines.  They just
gobble up system resources and prevent that you can use Alt-F5 or
Alt-F6 in any application.  You can safely remove them.

For this, try

  Key F5    A    M    Prev (AcceptsFocus) Focus
  Key F6    A    M    Next (AcceptsFocus) Focus

The third column is the context.  "Any" means that the binding
works everywhere, regardless of where the pointer is.

Until now I have failed to make sense of references to the "context" and
"modifier" entries.

A very full explanation starts on line 3418 of the fvwm2 man page - easy
to find once you know what to look for.

Maybe, the syntax (context and modifier) and the full range of codes are
also listed in one of the supplied configuration files and my failure
results from using fvwm-themes instead of diligently studying the
supplied samples. 

If so, would it be possible to have an entry in the themes-FAQ, that
summarises the codes and points to the relevant section of the man page?

It's in the entry for the "Mouse" command, and the "Key" entry
says:

  The syntax is the same as for a Mouse binding ...

Isn't that clear enough?  Perhaps you tried to be too clever when
looking for the information?

Look at the man page and you should see it clear as day.

I am using fvwm 2.2.2 on HP-UX 11.0 (though I have been consdering
updating, perhaps this will give me reason to).  At times I want to
run a full-screen vncviewer to another session also managed by fvwm
with the same bindings, etc.

I want my mouse / key actions to be received by the fvwm in the vnc
session, not by my local fvwm2.  Is there a way to specify that ALL
events should be given to a particular window?  I guess with the
exception of some key sequence I would need to break out of the vnc
session, that is...

Thanks,
Jeremy

Hi,

Mikhael Goikhman already graciously addressed my
question, but I was wondering if the below
hack would be of interest to you:

I thought it might be nice to add regex type
name matching to conditions. So I hacked in
some support for things like:

DestroyFunc RaiseWarptoWin
AddToFunc   RaiseWarptoWin
    + I Focus
    + I Iconify -1
    + I Raise
    + I WarpToWindow 50 50

Key F2 A N Next (RegexMatch "[Ss]omename.*[0-9]") RaiseWarptoWin

I'm not sure exactly what !RegexMatch should mean, since
that's (I believe?) kind of handled by '!' in front of
the name itself. Suggestions welcome on this.

Also - PCRE (perl regex) functionality can easily be had
by simply doing #include <pcreposix.h>. This wraps the
posix regcomp/exec calls nicely (see man pcreposix).

I'll include the -c diffs below in case anyone remotely
cares... If not, sorry for the bandwidth, and thanks
again for the help.

k.

I have Adobe's Acrobat reader version 5.0.6 installed
on my Linux 2.4.20 box and I can't figure out why
the find dialog window does not receive the focus when it is opened.
The issue occurs with version 4 of the reader too.

I was running fvwm 2.4.0 and just installed 2.4.14 but that didn't fix the problem.
I use the clicktofocus style for all of my windows.

Does anyone have any suggestions for getting these find windows
to get the focus when they are opened?

Thanks.

If you use ClickToFocus, GrabFocusTransient is the default.
What application do you run?

You may have a problem if you define SloppyFocus/MouseFocus for your
window, then you should reissue GrabFocusTransient after SloppyFocus.
Or maybe you listen to add_window in FvwmEvent and then do something.

Does your problem occur with a minimal configuration, i.e. if you run:

  fvwm -cmd "Style * ClickToFocus, DecorateTransient"

I just did:

  Restart /opt/fvwm-2.4/bin/fvwm -cmd "Style * ClickToFocus"

and it works well, transients automatically get focus.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Jeremy,

We have been doing the same thing, only with linux and fvwm 2.4.7 and have found that if you have the numlock key pressed all key events go to the fvwm in the VNC window, without numlock they go to the 'main' fvwm - this works fine for us!

best wishes

Mike

I've tried with 2.4.14 and the  Acrobat reader. I can reproduce the pbs.
I've also tested with xemacs, some kde apps, and Netscape: no pbs.

PS: - I've tried with 2.5.6, the Acrobat reader "pb" is here
only if !FPGrabFocus.
- All test done with SloppyFocus

Jipie!
Almost everything ist transparent now!
I'm totally proud about what I've done, so I have to show all of you my
screenshot: http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ugk8/screenshot.png

My X-Server hab needs more than 100MB in my RAM and it takes a really
awful hell lot of time to start fvwm2 now. (I even think about using
FvwmBanner for startup...) Well KDE3 starts a lot faster! :-)

But all this is it worth to have this Design!

It's of course not perfect, I still don't get the focused page in my
pager transparent and the focused menu entry. Anybody can help my?

Jeremy,

We have been doing the same thing, only with linux and fvwm 2.4.7 and have found that if you have the numlock key pressed all key events go to the fvwm in the VNC window, without numlock they go to the 'main' fvwm - this works fine for us!

best wishes

Mike

* About memory: 

You use a 1512x864 root image. This implies that each colorset takes
~ 2Mb of memory. As you use 15 colorsets and you set your root background
with an Esetroot compatible program the memory usage of your config
is ~ 32Mb. A few suggestion:

  - Use a small (pretty) image to set your background.
  - When possible use the Transparent option and not the RootTransparent
    option (read carefully the FvwmTheme man page; Transparent + tint
    work only under certain special circonstance)
  - When possible do not use the "buffer" option (this is ok in general
    for a module that you rarely move & resize)
 
* About speed: 

Here one of your Colorset config definition:

Colorset 0 fg Black, NoShape, Plain, Transparent
Colorset 0 RootTransparent buffer
Colorset 0 tint white 40

Not first that "Plain" and "Transparent" are useless. I will write:

Colorset 0 fg Black, NoShape, RootTransparent buffer, tint white 40

This take some times because tinting a big image takes some
times (it is XRender which performs the tinting if you use a
recent XFree; with XFree-4.3 I hope that tinting will be mmxed).
With your config this is done 15 times.

Now, you do not specify a bg colour. This leads fvwm to compute
the average colour of your big root image. This is slow (more
slow than tinting). Again this is done 15 times. I think that
you can really speedup your startup time by specifying a bg
colour in all the definition of your colorsets:

Colorset 0 fg Black, bg grey, NoShape, RootTransparent buffer, tint white 40

If you really want an average bg (as this gives good sh/hi colours for
the 3d reliefs; but I do not think you want that, as almost every
things is flat on your screenshot), you can compute only one time the
average colour:

Colorset 0 fg Black, bg average, NoShape, RootTransparent buffer, tint white 40

Colorset 1 fg DarkGrey, bg $[bg.cs0], RootTransparent buffer, tint black 40
Colorset 2 fg Black, bg $[bg.cs0], RootTransparent buffer, tint white 40
..etc..

This is not perfect: if colorset 0 change, then the bg colour of the
colorset 1, 2, ...etc will be not updated. What we may do is to
cache the average colours.

I've noted that a few of your colorsets are identical (e.g., cs 0 and
2). Of course reducing the nbr of tinted RootTransparent cset will
speed up your startup and will reduce memory usage. What we should do
is to cache tinted images as we cache images.

Active menus entries do not use the Colorset image they just use the
bg Colorset (maybe one day the image will be used).  But you can use
the HilightBackOff menu style option.

For the pager the "focused" desk label does not use the colorset image
(just the colorset bg). But the focused page can be transparent.

Hello list,

How can I change the style of that little window, that shows the
geometry when resizing or moving an window?

Style "*" Font foo
does not work for example. (fvwm2.5.5)
And frow where does it get its color?

Greetings Klaus

DefaultFont 10x20
DefaultColors rgb:ff/ff/ff rgb:ff/00/00

With this, the font will be 10x20. The windows will have a red background with
white foreground.

Is there a way to change the IconTitle style? I don't see anything
relating to it in the man page, except for "how to change the font".
I would like to change the colours, too...

    Ibook G3 600 Mhz (384 MB Ram)
Hi:
I have installed fvwm2 as a window manager to work with Xdarwin; when in
full screen mode I can have access to the fvwm2 menu by clicking anywhere on
the screen; this way can get xterm and other utilities; but when working in
rootless mode how can I get access to the menu? What are the commands? Do I
need any additional installation?
Sorry for this trivial (probably) question, but is out of my knowledge.
    As a note, I did not add any .fvwm2rc or any other file; just got the
basic configuration when installed the fvwm2.

    Thank you.

acroread sets the "transientfor" window to an unmapped, 1x1 window
at a random screen position.  I think fvwm does the right thing by
ignoring the "transient" hint altogether as in many other
situations.  Popping up a transient dialog for a non existing
window is meaningless and might well cause that the window is
never even mapped.  Someone should send a bug report to Adobe.

There *is* a bug in 2.5.x that makes transients lose their
transientfor window if they are created while the transientfor is
iconified or on another desk.  I will commit a fix.

Bye

*FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 12

should work. If this does not work can you check that the only
pager config read is in Acid6uru-fvwmpager.hook. I will remove
the lines:

*FvwmPager:             FocusColorSet   9
*FvwmPager:             Pixmap          none

and add at the beging of the file

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPager*

After that for testing

Read Acid6uru-fvwmpager.hook

and restart the pager (or the Button if it is swallowed).

Which version of fvwm do you have this working on?

I've looked at your config files and tried to adapt bits of them to my
setup.  I'm trying both 2.5.4 and 2.5.5.

After a struggle I finally managed to get transparent menus like this:

Colorset 0 fg white, bg black, Shape, Plain
Colorset 0 Transparent
#Colorset 0 RootTransparent
Colorset 0 tint black 30
MenuStyle * MenuColorset 0

... but if I uncomment the 3rd Colorset line, I just get white text on
black menus with no transparency.

I can't get transparent title bars or borders at all though.  With title
bars I'm trying to do

Colorset 1 fg white, bg black, Shape, Plain
Colorset 1 Transparent
Colorset 1 tint #4060a0 30
TitleStyle	Inactive Colorset 1

but this has no effect and I just get a syntax error reported on the
console:
    unknown style Colorset : Colorset 1

Any clues?  The syntax for this stuff doesn't seem to be documented much
yet.

Thanks
Richard

You don't really need to split a colorset definition to 3 lines,
see enother message in this thread that explains speed problems.

To use RootTransparent use should run "fvwm-root -r bg-image.png|xpm"
first. Or Esetroot.

You need 2.5.5 for this.

Only RootTransparent works in titles, not Transparent.

It is currently fully documented in the FvwmTheme man page that is
referred in the COLORSETS section of the fvwm man page, is not it?

Since you don't have a root window to click on, you'll have to make a
keybinding to bring up the menu (I don't think there is one by default.)
 If you used the setup form when you first installed fvwm, it probably
created a .fvwm2rc for you (look for ~/.fvwm2rc or ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc),
and in that case you can just add something like:

Key F12		A	M	Menu MenuFvwmRoot

to the .fvwm2rc, which binds meta (M) + f12 in any (A) context to Menu
MenuFvwmRoot (which is defined in the configuration that the setup form
generates.)

Hope that helps,

Hi guys, this is my first post, altought I am an old fvwm user, and I am trying figure out how to configure a button to change its image when Shade is changed too.
I am using:
...
Style "*" MWMFunctions, MWMDecor
...
ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp   (Pixmap shadeup-activeup.xpm     -- Flat) \
              ActiveDown (Pixmap shadeup-activedown.xpm   -- Flat) \
              Inactive   (Pixmap shadeup-inactive.xpm     -- Flat) \
              ToggledActiveUp   (Pixmap shadedown-activeup.xpm   -- Flat) \
              ToggledActiveDown (Pixmap shadedown-activedown.xpm -- Flat) \
              ToggledInactive   (Pixmap shadedown-inactive.xpm   -- Flat)
...
Mouse 0 4 A WindowShade
...

So..., any clue?

It uses the same colors as your focused and unfocused titlebar.

you can change it by using the Colorset, HilightColorset styles or
HilightFore, HilightBack, BackColor and  ForeColor styles.

Yes, I saw that message.  I was doing it as I was for debugging, so that
I could selectively comment and uncomment things to find out what made
it work.  Now I've cracked it I'm moving to the single line approach.

With fvwm-root -r this is now working fine for me.  I was using xsetbg
before.  The manual page says that ought to work, but I suspect I wasn't
using a new enough version.

Ok - I've now switched to 2.5.5 and it's basically working as I expected
- thanks.

Yes, it's there as you say.  I was relying on just 'man fvwm' and not
finding much.

Thanks again.

I'm not familiar with the setup, but using FvwmCommandS and
FvwmCommand, as long as you can execute system commmands, you can
send commands to fvwm.

Oh. So that's the way it works. Mea culpa, I was fixed on searching for
something like "IconColorset". Well, it sure works. Thanks!

Hello everyone,

Just like everybody else I'm building My Perfect .fvwm2rc :-). I like 
to be able to resize a window by right dragging on the titlebar, so I 
put this in my rc:

  Mouse 3 T A Function TitleLeftClick
  AddToFunc TitleLeftClick
  + M Resize

This works almost as I expected, except for one weirdness: when I move 
the pointer away from the center of the window, it's resized (OK, 
normal). But when my first move is toward the center, the mousecursor 
moves but the window isn't resized. I have to move outward first, then 
I can move inward and the window resizes. Strange enough, the other 
resize function:

  Mouse 1 SF A Resize

works exactly as I expected, initially moving towards the center makes 
the window smaller.

Sorry if I overlooked the obvious in the manpage, does anybody have a 
solution? Thanks!

It does not resize immediately because it does not know which
border you want to grab.  The second example works as you expect
because This is not problem with the "S"ide and "F"rame contexts.

Thanks for reacting. You're right. I hadn't noticed this before, but 
also when moving away from the center, the resize only starts after the 
mousecursor has passed a border.

Is there a way to do a "border-unaware-resize"? TIA!

No, sorry.  The resize starts only when you touch any border.

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I've previously written about this problem, but I have yet to solve it. 
 I cannot get FVWM to properly display XPM pixmaps at their original 
color depth (they appear to be at most 8-bit).  I've tried running 
2.4.13, 2.5.4, and 2.5.5, all on a Sun UltraSPARC Solaris 2.7 system.  I 
built FVWM with xpm-3.4k and libpng-1.2.5, and after running configure 
it's reported that xpm and png support was successfully included. 
 Running make and make install seem to go without a problem.  My system 
certainly supports 24-bit colordepth, as I have no problem viewing these 
XPM pixmaps with 'xv', and am able to view all PNGs with GIMP.  Am I 
overlooking something here?  Are not enough colors being allocated for 
fvwm, and if so, how can this be changed?  I should also mention that I 
am not even able to view any PNG icons with fvwm-2.5.x.  For instance, 
"Style xterm Icon dtterm.png" doesn't give me any icon, despite having 
the Imagepath pointing to the location of the png file.  Any help to 
resolve these issues is greatly appreciated.  thanks.

Looking thru the mail archive, the last thing I see is a request
that you send the output of xdpyinfo and the PrintInfo colors
fvwm command.

Most likely your display card supports both 8 and 24 bit visuals
at the same time.  Fvwm is probably picking the 8 bit visual.

Using the -C TrueColor option seemed to fix my pixmap problem.  I still 
cannot load PNGs though. hmmm.

I take that back.  Although I can now see pixmaps in full color in fvwm, 
when I start FVWM I get a core dump, and several lines of Error Messages 
are printed to the FvwmConsole.  This also somehow prevents FvwmTaskbar

Post the messages.

For the core file, mention the release, and if possible
provide a stack trace.  To produce the stack trace, run
this command:

dbx `which fvwm2` core

do this in the directory containing the core file.
when dbx comes up, type "where".

Hello,

I've been watching (silently) as the Arabic joining/shaping patch finally
safe and running. For those not familiar with the patch, here:
  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0212/msg00252.html

I would really like to see this go into the main src tree and wonder when this
will happen. I know many others would be looking anxiously to see this become
part of fvwm proper ;)

Thanks

Do you have any error message in your X output?

Just to be sure, what does "fvwm-config --supports | grep png" return?

There are XPMs with more than 8-bit colour?
I'm not trying to discard your actual problem, but the above is news to me.

Please don't send html to the list.
In my mail reader, it shows up as one line.
I reflexivly delete html as it's spam 99% of the time.
For others that won't see html, here's what Ben sent:

> Here's the error message:

Error 8 = Badmatch

I'm not sure about the rest.  Yet.

> Can't run dbx right now. Being on a corporate machine, I can't seem to

On our Suns I find it in:

/opt/forte62/SUNWspro/bin/dbx
/opt/SUNWspro/bin/dbx
/opt/forte61/SUNWspro/bin/dbx

> Dtsession*wmStartupCommand: /lsi/home/bsferraz/bin/fvwm-2.5.5/bin/fvwm -C TrueColor

Don't forget the Timeout stuff or you'll get really
slow startup.  See the Fvwm FAQ.

I think we need:

fvwm version
xdpyinfo output
PrintInfo Colors output

To get the PrintInfo Colors output, when you're running under CDE
look in $HOME/.dt.  I think its somewhere in there.

If you still can't find it, you can try changing the StartupCommand,
add this to the end:

 >/tmp/fvwm.out 2>&1

Sorry you're having these problems.  Be patient, we'll get it.

Almost all XPMs specify 24 bit color (#rrggbb), and it seems that the
version of libxpm that I have installed (XFree 4.2) has no problem
parsing 48 bit color (#rrrrggggbbbb) either.  If you're talking about
the number of distinct colors in an xpm file, xpm allows for more than
one character as a color specifier (e.g.: "m+ c #327E58".)

I threw a small example at http://themuffin.net/wastesedge_32x32.xpm
(since I don't want to send a 6kb attachment to everyone on the list ;)

I've recently installed XFree-4 on a laptop and slapped fvwm-2.5.3 on it.

I copied over my trusty .fvwm2rc (carryover from fvwm-1.22 days) and made
the standard system-specific tweaks.  One disappointing item of note is that
my "Move" and "Resize" (F2 and F4) key mappings don't work.

The relevant lines in the .fvwm2rc file look like:

Key      F2     A       N       Move-or-Raise
Key      F3     A       N       Menu Window-Ops
Key      F4     WTFS    N       Resize-or-Raise
Mouse    0      1       A       Menu Window-Ops2 Close
Mouse    1      TS      A       Move-or-Raise
Mouse    1      F       A       Resize-or-Raise
Mouse    2      TSF     A       Resize-or-Raise
Mouse    2      R       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
AddToMenu Window-Ops            "Window Ops"            Title
+                               "Move"                  Move-or-Raise2
+                               "Resize"                Resize-or-Raise2
AddToMenu Window-Ops2           "Move"                  Move-or-Raise
+                               "Resize"                Resize-or-Raise
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise         "I" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "D" Lower
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise2        "M" Raise
+                               "M" Move
+                               "D" Lower
AddToFunc Resize-or-Raise       "I" Raise
+                               "M" Resize
+                               "D" Lower
AddToFunc Resize-or-Raise2      "M" Raise
+                               "M" Resize
+                               "D" Lower

Here's how it works (and doesn't):

* F2 and F4 do not work (well, they do raise the window if lowered)
* F3 and then selecting "Move" or "Resize" does not work at all
* Clicking on the upper left icon and selecting "Move" or "Resize"
  performs exactly as F2/F4 above
* Mouse1 in `T' or `S' works as expected
* Mouse1 in `F' works as expected
* Mouse2 in `T', `S', or `F' works as expected
* Mouse2 in `R' works only if I continue to hold down mouse button (new
  behavior)

Am I missing something in my functions to compensate for not holding the
button down (when calling them from menu or function key)?

(please don't cc: me, I'm on the list. :)

This example file seems to contain only 244 colours.
[...digs around...] Found the XPM spec. Seems to have no colour table size
limit. I withdraw my ignorant assertion.

Ok, I've whipped out the manpages and am educated (once again) on what the
letter codes are.

Also, I've discovered that they work if I click the mouse immediately after
pressing the function key.  Therefore, it looks like something changed in
the code and all "I"s are treated like "C"s when called from a kbd event.

Can someone verify?

I'm available for code testing (24-hr turnaround, usually), just e-mail the
diff to me.

Greetings!

Recently I've started using themes.  I'm using a combination of theme
configs from the latest fvwm-themes and the themes-extra packages.  One
minor problem I've had are with graphical artifacts.  I'm currently
using the osx theme and the top bar will sometimes contain artifacts as
will pop-up menus.  Refreshing the screen or popping up the menu again
gets rid of them, but I'd like to prevent them in the first place.  An
example of this can be found at:
http://www.jdwhite.org/~jdwhite/artifacts.png

Any thoughts on what might be causing these artifacts would be
appreciated.

Thank you,
-Jason

I think this is wrong.
"M" stands for motion, yes, but I think you need a click to define the
beginning of the motion.

If you want to move immediately after pressing F2, then do this:
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise I Raise
+ I Move
+ D Lower

It will work. But then your "D" doesn't work anymore. You need in fact a
triple click (1 to end the move, 2 to lower)

Try this then:
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise I Raise
+ I Move
+ C Lower

This should do what you intended initially. This is done on 2.4.13.

Hope this it helps.
Christian

I can't identify anything like on the screenshot. How did you get it?
Can you post a screenshot without artifacts?

Hello,

I just upgraded to FVWM 2.5.5 from 2.5.2, and my barbuttons has
vanished.. ;)

Can anyone give me any idea where it might have gone to? I include the
relevant config below. It all worked fine on 2.5.2.

There is no relevant info being output on the console from FVWM, and the
panel does appear in the window list (when WindowListSkip is removed),
but when I click on it the pointer jumps to the correct place on the
screen, but nothing is there!

Any ideas?

Cheers,

Andy

It didn't used to be this way ("M" requiring a click).  <insert standard

Yeah, this does work, but I think it's a bug in the code.

I wonder what changed between 2.2.4 and 2.4.13 that changed this behavior.
The functions I'm using are *still* in assorted file in sample.fvwmrc/.

anyway, thanks for the workaround.

I gave you the command:

dbx `which fvwm2` core

it sounds like you ran:

dbx core

perhaps the "which" command isn't working right.
As I remember, you executed fvwm using the full path.
Try running it this way instead:

dbx /lsi/home/bsferraz/bin/fvwm-2.5.5/bin/fvwm core

then type in "where".

Hmm, one of the other developers will probably look at this.
I see you ran with -C Truecolor, but the cards first Truecolor
visual is 8 bit.  I think that might be a problem.

It might be better to use the visualid as in:

-I 0x28

instead of

-C TrueColor

I'm sorry, I should know exactly where the CDE stderr ends up,
but I hated CDE so much, I just had it removed from my workstation.

I did run with it once...OK, I found it.
The fvwm output should be in $HOME/.xsession-errors

Well, you're not too exceptional, I was running fvwm on a Sun until about
a year ago, and I still support a bunch of users using Sun's.
One of the reasons I gave up on the Sun was the lack of 24 bit
color at a sufficiently high resolution.  If I had a nice display
card like you do, I might still be using a Sun.

Nah, Linux is more fun.

Did you get no answer at all?

I use:

Style * MouseFocus

and I avoid using the mouse as much as I can.

I can't recall loosing focus on a maximize,
the pointer should still be in the window on a maximize.

When you make it smaller, thats different, the pointer could
leave the window then.  Is that when you loose focus?

I don't use M-tab much though.

What focus model are you using?

Yeah, 'which' didn't seem to work before.  The above works though. 
 Seems FvwmTaskBar is causing the core dump.  As I mentioned before, 
once I add '-C TrueColor', or '-I 0x28' for that matter, FvwmTaskBar 
craps out.  Here's what happens when I run the above.

Reading fvwm
dbx: core object name "FvwmTaskBar" doesn't match object name "fvwm"
core file ignored. Use -f to force loading of corefile
dbx: warning: core file header read failed


When re-run with FvwmTaskBar path included:

Actually, using '-C TrueColor' does allow me to view pixmaps correctly 
now under fvwm.  It's just that once I add that option, I start 
receiving those Errors and FvwmTaskBar core dumps.  So, I correct one 
problem, introduce more.

PrintInfo Colors output doesn't seem to be going to ~/.xsession-errors. 
 Maybe I should try running another fvwm process on top of the existing 
one from the command line, but redirect its output to another file.  I 
suppose this is kind of what you were instructing me to do before with 
the '>'.  Any ideas here?

Thanks,
Ben

If you can't redirect the fvwm stderr in the first place (why?), there are
several ways to do this on the fly.

If (and only if) fvwm is not the last xinit program running in the
foreground you may replace it with another fvwm that you run from any
xterm using: "fvwm -replace >& fvwm.out"  (with some shells you need
to do "> fvwm.out 2>&1". Otherwise you may quit X by doing this.

Another way that should always work is to issue "Restart xterm" from
FvwmConsole or menus. Then when you get xterm and no decorations (since no
window manager is run), you may start fvwm inside this xterm by executing
"fvwm" with optional stdout/stderr redirection. Just remember to close
this xterm to close your X session with some X setups.

Regards,
Mikhael.

OK, so now we know that the core is coming from FvwmTaskBar
when it enters the X Error handler.  You posted the message
from the X error handler a while back it was:

> [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
> [FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 66, Error 8, EventType:4
> 
> EventType can vary though it seems. I've seen 0, 28.

Request 66 = X_PolySegment
Error 8 = Badmatch
EventType 4 = buttonpress
EventType 28 = PropertyNotify

So, I think its drawing some lines and getting a badmatch error.
The eventtypes don't make sense to me.

I don't see any references to polysegment in FvwmTaskBar or
in the libs directory, so I'm a bit lost.  Maybe one of our
X experts or FvwmTaskBar experts (Olivier?) can help me out?

No, you can only run one copy of fvwm at a time.
I'm not sure the output of PrintInfo Colors is important anymore,
the above information narrows the problem down a bit.

Lets see what one of our experts thinks is the next step.

Fvwm is being launched by the CDE session manager.
It gets the name of the binary to launch from an X Resource.
Perhaps the way its starting the window manager doesn't use
a shell with enough smarts to support command line redirection.

Mikhael, thats cool, I wasn't aware of the -replace up until now.
Read my other mail, I don't know that PrintInfo Colors is
useful anymore.  I could be wrong of course, it wouldn't be
the first time, (or the last).

In the private message to me you said this is some GNOME panel.
I initially thought you may have problems with your X driver, but it is
most likely GTK problems, probably the osx theme engine is not perfect.
I myself have glitches with submenu triangles in GTK+-1.2 that are not
drawn correctly, they are somewhat fixed when items are activated.

Does running "xrefresh" help? Anyway, try to ask on GNOME lists.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Mikhael,

Actually, when I said run another fvwm I was thinking of the '-replace' 
option.  That did work.  I reran it without using '-C TrueColor', and 
here's what PrintInfo Colors gives me.

FVWM info on colors
  Visual ID: 0x20, Default?: Yes, Class: PseudoColor
  Depth: 8, Number of colors: 256
  Pallet with 64 colors, Number of free colors: 0
  Auto Detected: Yes, Strict: No, Allocated: Yes, Dynamic: No
  Number of colours used by fvwm:
    In the table: 64
    Out of the table: 9
    Total: 73

So by default, it seems fvwm is grabbing 8-bit color mode.  When I use 
'-C TrueColor' it seems to be running correctly as far as color (though 
I should probably get the PrintInfo Colors info for this too), but 
that's when I start having the FvwmTaskBar issues.

Thanks,
Ben

  Hang on....some confusion here.  I never sent you a private message on
  this.  I never mentioned anything about GNOME.  This isn't a GNOME
  applet.  This is simply an FvwmButtons bar with some swallowed
  FvwmScript applets.

  The 'artifacts.png' file should show some vertical bars through the
  "35" on left side of the image and some more in the lower right
  through "December 17".

Just to be sure this problem with FvwmTaskBar core dumping when 
TrueColor is used isn't just with fvwm-2.5.5, I also loaded fvwm-2.4.13 
and fvwm-2.5.4 with '-visual TrueColor' and the same problem occurs.

Here's the PrintInfo Colors when run with '-C TrueColor'

FVWM info on colors
  Visual ID: 0x28, Default?: No, Class: TrueColor
  Depth: 24, Number of colors: 16777216, No Pallet (static colors)
  red: 256, green: 256, blue 256

So all looks good as far as picking the right visual ID, with TrueColor.

thanks,
Ben

Sorry then, please be a bit more verbose so no confusion is possible. :)
I get dozens of messages daily, it is easy to make a mistake.
Someone (not you) sent me this private message:

  i recently installed a osx-like machine for someone here at the office,
  using gnome 1.4 and sawfish from slackware 8.1, and i had the same.
  may be it's a GTK problem with background images.

So I thought it was your reply to my question "How did you get it?"
and thus you use the same panel as you installed for someone else.

Ok, so all of these applets that are on the screenshot are your own.
If you think they may be useful for someone else, send them to us.
fvwm-themes-0.6.2 already includes your FvwmApplet-APMMon, but it is not
used yet anywhere.

Can you send your full FvwmButtons configuration and the applets that
generate these "35" and "December 17" strings?

Which fvwm and fvwm-themes versions do you use?

Regards,
Mikhael.

  The APMMon is mine, yes.  I've since created an enhanced version that
also uses pixmaps to show images.  I've also created the WLANMon applet
which shows the signal strength on your wireless device.  Also have the
applet that shows volume level.  These applets were inspired by OSX and
the images uses are taken from screenshots from OSX provided by a
friend, cropped and touched up by me.  I'm hesitant to release the
images because I'm unsure of the legality of distributing those images.
Anyone have thoughts on this?

  The WLANMon applet and the VolStatus applets mostly just show status
at this point -- not much else.  I would like to have the WLANMon applet
display a list of WLAN related actions and the VolStatus applet to call
a mixer.  Ideally I'd like to be able to left click on the icon to lower
the volume and right-click to raise.  Unfortunately, FvwmScript only
seems to recognize that a click event has been made and not
differentiate between types of clicks.  I also thought that I could
control volume using mouse actions from FvwmButtons, but it would seem
that the FvwmScript applet grabs the click events before FvwmButtons --
FvwmButtons doesn't "see" them.

  The "35" is from a temperature status applet I wrote.  Attached.
  "December 17" is a modified FvwmApplet-DigiClock.  Also attached.

>Which fvwm and fvwm-themes versions do you use?

  Fvwm-2.4.14.  fvwm-themes-0.6.2 with fvwm-themes-extra-0.6.0 for the
  base osx theme bits.

  Here's another example of artifacts I'm seeing:
    http://www.jdwhite.org/~jdwhite/artifact2.png

  I only ever see this on windows/apps that are using the white/grey
  line background pixmap from the osx theme such as the menubar and the
  menus.  Been using fvwm for ages and hadn't seen this behavior prior
  to using the osx theme.  Interestingly enough, my wife (also using
  this theme) has yet to see any artifacts, so it's probably something
  unique to my X setup.

Ok, the dbx was useful. But now that you know how to get fvwm
sdterr can you send all error messages you get (specialy when the
the FvwmTaskBar core dump)? Your FvwmTaskBar config can be useful too.

Well, if this used to work in 2.2.x as you claim, it was a bug in
2.2.x.  Obviously, anything but "I" makes zero sense in keyboard
bindings, and relying on it to work in a certain way is relying on
unspecified behaviour.

Key bindings should not use the mouse related bits "M", "D", "H"
and "C".  Use this instead:

  Key f2 A N Move

  AddToFunc Raise-and-Move-kb
  + I Raise
  + I Move

  Key f2 A N Raise-and-Move-kb

The functions are not intended to be used for key bindings.

By accident, not by design.  I won't give in to the reasoning
"It was broken for years, so it must not be fixed."

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello,

I posted a similar mail to the list yesterday, but this is a different
problem.

I have the following config which used to work in 2.5.2, but which now
no longer behaves as it should. I used to have an icon on the top right
of my screen which when clicked caused a panel to slide out from the
right. The icon used to appear on a transparent button so that the image
looked like it was floating on its own.

Since doing the upgrade I can't get the button to be transparent without
the icon also disappearing. According to the manual the Pixmap none line
should do what I want (and did in the old version) but it doesn't seem
to work now.

Can anyone help?

Thanks,

Andy

Hello,
I am looking for a solution to a problem:
 I need to keeping an app on the screen without being able to move it
around.  I basically built a Kiosk using RH 7.2,  displaying HTML pages
with Netscape.  However I can move the window up/down, I took care of
left/right with (EdgeScroll is 0 0).  
I want to keep a window with it's tool bar, maximized, but not
moveable.  I covered up the menu bar with an image so users do not have
access to any control options.   Also, I  turned off all control buttons
in the title bar.
I already tried Style "*"     FixedPosition, Style "netscape"  
FixedPosition and it still allowed me to move the window.  
Any suggestions??   
Thanks,

eh.  Nah, just pointing out that this is the first major rewrite I've had
to do to my .fvwm{,2}rc file since converting them from v1 to v2.

Yes, I see your point, I'll fix my crap.  It looks like the change you gave
will not upset the behavior on the systems running older versions, so I'm
cool with that.

Peace, Love, Beer.

Maybe you can start Netscape with the -geometry option to set the window
to the size of the display and don't use a WM.

I hope that I've fixed the TaskBar and this "66" error (which is
an fvwm error). Can you try the "next" fvwm snapshot:

ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/devel/snapshots/fvwm-snap-20021220.tar.gz

which should be up soon.

I hope that this option is not needed now. fvwm will use the best
TrueColor visual automatically.

Go through your config file and remove all "Key", "PointerKey" and
"Mouse" commands that bind the Move, Resize, Maximize etc.
commands to the window decorations.  To disable the built in
defaults, edit the file ConfigFvwmDefaults that comes with the
distribution.

I think there are a couple of bugs in 2.5.5.

1) The Layer command doesn't seem to be working.  The relevant bits of
   my .fvwm2rc file are

AddToFunc "Put-on-top" "I" Layer 0 6
+                      "I" RefreshWindow

AddToFunc "Put-on-bottom" "I" Layer 0 2
+                      "I" RefreshWindow

AddToFunc "Put-at-default" "I" Layer 0 4
+                      "I" RefreshWindow

Mouse 0 3    A Function "Put-on-top"
Mouse 0 5    A Function "Put-on-bottom"
Mouse 0 7    A Function "Put-at-default"

AddToMenu Window-Ops "Window Ops" Title
[snip other stuff]
+	"StayOnTop"		Put-on-top
+	"StayOnBottom"		Put-on-bottom
+	"PutBackToDefault"	Put-at-default

Neither the title bar buttons nor the menu entries change the stacking
order in 2.5.5.  These settings worked OK in earlier 2.5.x releases.

2) The transparency setting is being ignored for some title bar buttons.
   Again the relevant bits of ~/.fvwm2rc are

ButtonStyle 7 21 40x0@0 40x12@1 20x12@1 50x42@0 10x42@1 10x58@1 50x58@0 20x88@1 40x88@0 40x100@1 60x100@0 60x88@0 80x88@0 50x58@0 90x58@0 90x42@0 50x42@1 80x12@0 60x12@1 60x0@0 40x0@1 -- Flat

With these settings, windows without the focus have translucent borders,
title bars and title bar buttons, except for button 7 which stubbonly
refuses to be drawn transparent.  I've tried playing with the line
that's got "ToggledInactiveDown" in it but can't find a setting that
gives a transparent button in this case.  Similarly, if I click button 9
to make the window sticky, button 9 isn't drawn transparent.  Maybe
the transparency is ignored for buttons which have an active MwmDecor
setting of some kind.

I've a .png file illustrating the behaviour which I can send if required
(it's about 5k in size.)

Any clues, or are these bugs?

Thanks
Richard

hi guys, im working on a fluxbox theme for fvwm, im basing it all on
this screenshot i found on freshmeat:

http://themes.freshmeat.net/screenshots/31809/

this is where ive got so far:

http://taviso.decsystem.org/2002-12-20_1024x768.png

im currently working on making FvwmButtons look like a slit (the thin
pager thing along the top, if youve never used a *Box :), but im 
finding it difficult, this is all ive done (not much) :

http://taviso.decsystem.org/slit.png

im hoping someone else has done it before and got an example configuration
they could share, but these are the problems im having..

is there a way to use vectors instead of pixmaps to draw the buttons?

in the fm screenshot the slit has "one" to name the desk, i was thinking
of using PipeRead ... `/usr/games/number $d` to get that, but its not
working very well for me :( does anyone know an easier way?

is there anyway to get the title of the active window?

I can confirm that the Layer command does not work in cvs.

I didn't try it, but I can see possible problems with this. You don't set
transparency for all button states, so you don't have it in all cases.

For example, if you define the ToggledInactiveDown state, it does not
cover the ToggledInactiveUp state. Did you mean ToggledInactive?

You may just use AllInactive super-state that covers all inactive button
states: InactiveUp, InactiveDown, ToggledInactiveUp, ToggledInactiveDown:

  ButtonStyle 9 AllInactive Colorset 1 -- Flat

Also note that you may delete all individual button Colorset lines and use
one common ButtonStyle setting. The following line would be enough to
define transparency in all buttons (when window is inactive):

  ButtonStyle All AllInactive Colorset 1 -- Flat

Olivier,

Thanks!  Works great.  FvwmTaskBar is not core dumping, and I can get 
TrueColor without using the -C argument.

Thanks Olivier and Dan for all the help.

Drawing nice panels is not trivial. If it helps, take a look at this:

  file://html/fvwm-themes/screenshots/full/blackbox.gif

It is 2 years old, but Blackbox theme was not changed much in fvwm-themes
since then.

Currently you may only use vectors in titlebar buttons, not FvwmButtons.

You may use a new dynamical button text/icon functionality in 2.5.x.

The plan is this, define a named button in FvwmButtons using Id:

  *FvwmButtons: (Id deskname, Text zero)

Then execute: SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeButton deskname Text one
The word "one" may be what is defined using the DesktopName command.
Here is shown how $[desk.name3] may be expanded in two steps, first "3".

  AddToFunc MyGotoDesk
  + I GotoDesk $*
  + I PipeRead `echo "SendToModule FvwmButtons ChangeButton deskname Text \
        '\$[desk.name$d]'"

So, if you use MyGotoDesk instead of GotoDesk, the "zero" in FvwmButtons
will be automatically replaced with the current desk name.

> is there anyway to get the title of the active window?

It took me some time to understand this sentense. Yes, if you use $n in
functions it will contain the current title name, placed in single quotes
with all possible single quotes in the name properly quoted.
Try in FvwmConsole: Pick Exec xmessage $n


You may add spacing in menu entries if you play with MenuStyle ItemFormat.
Also if you press Backspace in 2.5.x in menus, you will get menu title.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Sorry for this url. But if you checkout fvwm-themes-web (like fvwm-web)
repository from cvs, you may make this url working for you too.

It is not really mine. It was submitted by Jos van Rick. See also:

Maybe in the future vector drawing will be separated from titlebar and it
will be possible to apply it to any colorset-ed area. But I don't think
this will be in 2.6.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello,

If you've seen any of my periodic emails over the last few months you
might remember that I've had a problem with transient windows popping up
all over the place and generally not behaving themselves.

In a burst of drunken enthusiasm I went delving into the source to try
and work out where the problem might be, and I think I've narrowed it
down to the StartsOnScreen setting. If I comment out the 'StartsOnScreen
c' line from my .fvwmrc everything seems to work fine (more testing
needed to check if it is definitely so), and intriguingly applications
still launch on the screen containing the mousepointer, which I was told
was the whole point of 'StartsOnScreen c'. (I'd be interested to know
why that is, out of curiousity?)

I believe the problem lies somwhere around the
FScreenTranslateCoordinates function in FScreen.c; possibly this
function's interaction with the XineramaSls functions, which I use with
NVidia's Twinview function in their drivers. Relevant lines from my rc:

XineramaSls True
XineramaSlsScreens 2 1152x864+0+0 1024x768+1152+0
XineramaPrimaryScreen 0

My guess would be that the translation is not behaving and is shifting
the window out of the actual space of the screen for some reason.
However, my contact with the FVWM codebase stands at about 10 minutes,
so I'll leave the proper debugging to people a bit more experienced. ;)

For whatever reason certain transient windows (such as replies in lICQ
and the Enigmail windows in Mozilla Mail don't appear correctly if the
pointer is in the second screen when they are spawned. Everything works
fine with 'StartsOnScreen c' commented out.

I hope this is of some use to someone ;)

Cheers,

Andy

I think your config is not correct.

The next line does not seem correct, it should be removed.

Ths next line is not correct too:
 
> *BarButtons: (Panel(left, delay 0, steps 4, position 100 270p) SubPanel
> "Module FvwmButtons SubPanel") Icon mini.penguin.xpm

it should be:

*BarButtons: (Icon mini.penguin.xpm, \
	Panel(left, delay 0, steps 4, position 100 270p) SubPanel \
	"Module FvwmButtons SubPanel")

With these modifications and after defining a "SubPanel" Buttons
it works fine here.

Dan, thank you very much for your response.
Actually I didn't dig into the focus issue - in fact 
I didn't know of different focus models.

No I didn't recieve any reaction yet, you were the
only one. I guess most people use the mouse pointer
on X - you mentioned using the mouse aswell.

In fact that is exactly what I would like to avoid.
My intention is to 'park' the pointer somewhere in the
desktop corner and do the rest just using the keyboard.

Making the window smaller (even using some key bindings)
should then not affect the focus. Have you tried just
parking the mouse somewhere on the wallpaper (you do
lose focus on any X-window then) - but regain focus
by M+Tabing through all open windows on the desktop
until you reach the desired one?

Hello,

Thanks for the help, Olivier. Unfortunately, after making the changes
ou've specified I'm still seeing the same problem. I've narrowed it down
to the Pixmap none line.. if this line is not commented out the button
with the penguin icon on it completely vanishes. If the line is
commented out then the button with the icon is visible, but the grey
background of the icon is also visible.

The effect I'm after is for the penguin icon to be visible, but not the
button it sits on. The Pixmap None line did this fine until I upgraded
to 2.5.5, but then it stopped working.

Thanks,

Andy

I use

AddToFunc       focus-and-raise
+ "I"   Focus
+ "I"   Raise
#+ "I"   PlaceAgain Anim
+ "I"   warptowindow 5p 5p


That solved that Problem.

My sensere thanks, additionaly as now the pointer
jumps automaticaly to the upper left window corner
I'm able to move the desired window to any place
on the desktop only using the keys.
This makes handling X so much easier.

Thanks again

Thanks Mikhael - replacing what I had before by that one line has solved
the problem.

The other half of my message (about the Layer command not working in
2.5.5) still stands, though.

fvwm-2.5.5

To make sure I understand the man page and FAQ correctly:  Having

Style *	FPGrabFocus

in my .fvwm2rc allows all new windows to grab the focus, but the only
way to focus and warp the pointer to all new windows is by using
FvwmEvent (FAQ, question 3.18)?  If so, I'm a bit confused by the
``FvwmEvent-NewWindow'' syntax (I didn't see any examples of
``FvwmEvent-<foo>:'' in FvwmEvent's man page).  If I already have these
lines

AddToFunc	StartFunction
+	I	Module FvwmEvent

in my .fvwm2rc, do I need to add a line for FvwmEvent-NewWindow?

Thanks much.

Yes, this is correct.

There is no single meaning of "warp the pointer". Some users preffer a
pointer to just to "50 50", some - to "10p 10p", and some - to "50 7p".

There is an example in the fvwm man page under MODULE COMMANDS. It is your
choice how to call module aliases. NewWindowEvent would be good too.

This is exactly the case when you want to use module aliases, to run
several instances of the same module with different actions.

You may name your original instance as something like FvwmEvent-Sound.

  *FvwmEvent-Sound: iconify ding.wav

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Sound
  + I Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow

Or continue to use it in a non-aliased form, just always use a
non-conflicting semicolon syntax, otherwise there will be conflicts.

  *FvwmEvent: iconify ding.wav

Mikhael.

  does FvwmButton depend on fvwm in a way that would make it impossible
to use it without fvwm? I understand that some code changes would be
needed since now it's fvwm module, my question is how much it depends on
fvwm for its functionality.

  any pointers to where to rtfm appreciated,

  TIA,

Like most other  Fvwm modules, FvwmButtons  exchanges information with
Fvwm over pipes.  The actual protocol is documented at:

http://www.fvwm.org/modules.html

There's probably a good part of FvwmButtons that would be useful
outside fvwm.

Hello, world!

I'm trying to set the position/geometry of the FvwmPager based on the
screens height/width. I think I need PipeRead for this but I'm afraid my
skills are not enough. :-)

I would like it too look something like this (appologies for my terrible
ascii skills :)):

                          X
    |--------------------------------------------|
    |                                            |
    |                                            |
    |                                            |
    |                                            |
    |                                            |
Y   |                                            |
    |                                            |
    |  B                                         |
    |--------------------------------------------|
  A |  1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10  |
    |--------------------------------------------|


What I want is that there should always be 10 pages at he bottom of the
screen, so the width (B) of the pages would be X/10.

The height (A) of the pages should always be one tenth of the screens
height (Y/10).

Could someone help me out with the commands to get this setup?

Regards,

Hi, all.

Just one quick question. Why do I get this in my .xsession-errors:

[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset 'fixed', trying
'-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Eventhough I don't have anything in my config file saying that I would
like to use this fixed as the font. I have set a diffrent Style * Font
also.

Another thing I don't get is why it can't seem to find the fixed font,
doing 'xlsfonts | grep '^fixed'' says I have it.

Regards,

Well, if you use no configuration at all it does what you want.
If you use 2.5.x it is also always works like you want, even if you added
ClickRaises, since mouse buttons 4 and 5 don't raise a window by default.
In 2.4.x you should disable ClickRaises for your big window, like:

  Style MyBigWindow MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

Or in case you use FvwmAuto, configure it not to raise a big window.

  FvwmAuto 200 "Silent ThisWindow (!MyBigWindow) Raise"

Mikhael.

If you use FvwmIdent or other module without specifying a font or you
don't set DefaultFont (for geometry window), the default "fixed" is used.

Actually "DefaultFont fixed" is always executed at startup in 2.4.x.

This was answered not once, you may, for example, search
http://www.mail-archive.com/fvwm@hpc.uh.edu/ for GetFontSetOrFixed or
similar. This archive only holds several last months though.

Short answer, upgrade to 2.5.5 or change your locale or replace your
fixed alias.

Mikhael.

I got quite close to this with:

DeskTopSize 10x1
*FvwmPager: Geometry $[vp.width]x100+0-0

However, the $[vp.width] "overlaps" abit to te next page, why is this?

> The height (A) of the pages should always be one tenth of the screens

This is still a pussle to me, just used 100 in the above example to test
width, anyone got a solution?

FvwmPager can't have just any arbitrary width or height.
In your case the width will always be 9 + 10 * N, for example 79 pixels,
because there are 9 separators.

Keeping this in mind, add this line to your config:

  *FvwmPager: DesktopScale 10

This makes a pager to be 9 pixels (or less) wider than needed. Not good.
I may suggest this instead:

  *FvwmPager: Geometry $[vp.width]x99

And of course:

  DesktopSize 10x1
  Style FvwmPager NoHandles, BorderWidth 0  # or non zero to fill the gap

If you need to do some calculations, I would suggest to use FvwmPerl for
this in 2.5.x, or do something like this (3 is for BorderWidth 3):

  PipeRead 'echo *FvwmPager: Geometry `expr $[vp.width] - 3 * 2`x99'

You may need to escape some chars in some cases, like `\\( 3 \\* 2 \\)`.

Mikhael.

However, I have used "Style * ClickToFocus" not "MouseFocus".
I do not want focus leave the window when mouse leave the window.

I want:
1. if mouse leave the window, the focus is still kept.
2. if mouse over other window then click left button,=20
that window get the focus and raise.
3. if mouse over other window then scroll wheel up or down,
that window can be scroll and get the focus but not raise.

How to configure to bring off all above??

I used MouseFocusClickRaises for a reason, since it is really hard to
suggest you want to scroll an unfocussed window (as with ClickToFocus).

I may miss some option, but I think that currently it is impossible to
do what you want exactly, it is possible to tweak a bit requirements.

Currently there is FPFocusClickButtons option that configures which mouse
buttons (4, 5) should be used for raise _and_ focus on a mouse click.
So this does not quite help to have both (2) and (3). There are also
FPClickRaisesFocused and !FPClickRaisesUnfocused, but this allows you
to only produce the first scrolling without raising, the second time will
raise the window.

So, you may politely ask Dominik to add "FPRaiseClickButtons 123" option
separate from the current "FPFocusClickButtons 12345".

Or just use a modifier, like Alt to achieve (2):

  Mouse 1 W M Raise

And if you have unused thumb mouse button (number 6 or 8 with your wheels)
you may use it instead of the left mouse button to achieve (2).

  Mouse 8 W A Raise

Personally, I don't automatically raise a window on click (except for
decorations) and use Alt with mouse number 2 for raising inside a window:

  Mouse 2 W M MoveOrRaiseLower

Another possibility is to tweak your another requirement, (3). It will
scroll, but not focus. To do this, just upgrade to 2.5.5 and use a usual
ClickToFocus and ClickToFocusRaises. I am not sure it is intended to pass
mouse button 4 to an unfocussed application, but this is the current
behaviour.

Regards,
Mikhael.

fvwm-2.5.5
xmms-1.2.5

I recently changed my .fvwm2rc so that any new window will get the focus
and get the pointer warped to it.  Everything works fine except for
xmms.  Usually I run xmms with both the equalizer and play list windows
(which are both ``snapped to'' the main xmms window), so starting xmms
actually creates three windows.  These three all move together when the
main window is moved.

What's happening is this:  I have one 2x2 desktop and usually run xmms
from the top right page.  After making the focus and warp changes,
starting xmms causes the pointer to go immediately to the top left
corner of the current page, which then causes the viewport to scroll to
the page immediately to the left.  Depending on what's on the left-hand
page, the main xmms window may or may not be connected to its other
windows.

The following is what I added to my .fvwm2rc (which is from the fvwm
FAQ, question 3.18):
########
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow:	Cmd
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow:	PassId
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow:	StartDelay 4
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow:	add_window FuncFocusWindow

DestroyFunc	FuncFocusWindow
AddToFunc	FuncFocusWindow
+ I WindowId $0 Focus
+ I WindowId $0	WarpToWindow 50 15p

AddToFunc	StartFunction I	FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow
########

What I'd like is for xmms to open on the current page but without
disabling edge scrolling.  Thanks very much for any help with this.

Hi FVWMers,
I have currently the following HotKey (Ctrl + Alt + S) to get the window with
the current focus into Layer 4 (the fvwm default, I think).

Key	S	W	CM	RaiseOnTop

DestroyFunc RaiseOnTop
AddToFunc RaiseOnTop
	+ I Layer 0 4
	+ I Raise 

I am looking for a helper function that moves the window with the current focus
into layer 4 and if it is already in layer 4 it should move the window to layer
10.

Any solutions?

As you might already know please reply also per eMail to me because I am
currently not subscribed to the list.

Greetings,
	Thomas

Please read "man FvwmButtons", it fully explains how to swallow windows.
There are also examples of swallowing clock in samples inside the fvwm
distribution, take a look at ConfigFvwmButtons on your system,
"locate ConfigFvwmButtons".

One solution is simply set a delay of 1-2 seconds for page scrolling.
Try "EdgeResistance 800 10". To be honest I don't know why 800 means
about 2 seconds and 1600 means 4 seconds on my machine.

XMMS is pretty problematic, since it is very different from normal
applications regarding its willing to manage the windows by itself.
Anyway here is another solution for your problem. Please read this
attentively to understant how to solve these kinds of problems.

I added this line to your function:

  + I WindowId $0 Echo $0 $n $c $r

and it seems that XMMS first opens window "xmms/Xmms/xmms" that is
immediatelly closed and opens another window (up to 3 windows) with
names "XMMS/xmms/XMMS_Player", "XMMS Equalizer/xmms/XMMS_Equalizer"
and "XMMS Playlist/xmms/XMMS_Playlist".

So you may want to disable focusing/warping of some of these windows.
You may replace function lines with something like:

  + I WindowId $0 (!Xmms) Focus
  + I WindowId $0 (!Xmms) WarpToWindow 50 15p

This should solve your problem of page scrolling, but then, it will
focus/warp to 2 other xmms windows too and you probably want only the main
one. So you may list all the names using more "WindowId $0" in the chain
or even use "ThisWindow", since there is a window context now. I also
suggest you to create another function for the actual commands, so you
don't need to duplicate your conditions for 2 or more times. I would do:

  *FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window FuncHandleNewWindow

  DestroyFunc FuncHandleNewWindow
  AddToFunc   FuncHandleNewWindow
  + I WindowId $0 \
        ThisWindow (!Xmms) \
        ThisWindow (!XMMS_Equalizer) \
        ThisWindow (!XMMS_Playlist) \
        FuncSelectWindow

  # common function that may be used in other places too
  DestroyFunc FuncSelectWindow
  AddToFunc   FuncSelectWindow
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I Iconify off
  + I WarpToWindow 50 15p

Add more window names to this ignore list if you like.

Regards,
Mikhael.

There is a Layer condition to do what you want:

  ThisWindow (Layer 4) Layer 10

Just keep in mind that if you want if-else construct you should use either
new 2.5.x Cond command or first conditionally construct a function and
only then execute it, like:

  # cyclicly change a window layer 4 -> 10 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4

  DestroyFunc ActuallyDoLayer
  AddToFunc   ActuallyDoLayer
  ThisWindow (Layer  4) + Layer 10
  ThisWindow (Layer  5) + Layer  9
  ThisWindow (Layer  9) + Layer  4
  ThisWindow (Layer 10) + Layer  5
  ActuallyDoLayer

P.S. Layer command does not work in 2.5.5 and in cvs for now.

Mikhael.

Thanks for the fast answer. It's the right direction but does not solve my
specific problem.

I need the following:

	If (Layer == 4) {
		put on Layer 10;
	} else {
		put on Layer 4;
	}

I tried the following, but it is crap anyway:

DestroyFunc RaiseOnTop
AddToFunc RaiseOnTop
	+ I Raise 
	+ ThisWindow (Layer 4)  Layer 10
	+ ThisWindow (!Layer 4) Layer 4

Because if it done I am back in Layer 4. So I see at the moment no way to solve
this problem. Do you habe any idea?

Greetings and thank you again for your fast response, 

	Thomas (who is still _not_ on the list ... so please reply by email,

You might try running it and doing an "xlsclients" or an "ps -ef".

Google turned up the name kdclock.

If that doesn't help, you might try a KDE list.

Perhaps you really want to issue "Close", "Delete" or "Destroy"?

If you are trying to generate a keystroke for an xterm, the
xterm won't accept a synthetic keystroke unless you've
selected "allow sendevents".  (Its a security hole to allow it.)

Do some Google searches on "xwindows synthetic".
The first hit I got discussed the issues in the context of
a security exploit.  It also mentioned some programs.

As far as I know, Fvwm doesn't have a command to generate keystrokes.

I've been teaching myself how to use colorsets in version 2.5.5,
and also the TaskBar (Macintosh-style, across the top.)
I have my own simple theme-changer setup where I load a small file
that contains button styles, menu styles, title styles, and colorsets.
I put something like this in the theme file:

*FvwmPager: Colorset * 2
*FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 3
*FvwmTaskBar: Colorset 2
*FvwmTaskBar: IconColorset 0
*FvwmTaskBar: FocusColorset 2
*FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon buttons/knot_blue.xpm

Then, when I want to change themes, I have a little function that
reads the decor file and re-starts the TaskBar and Pager:

AddToFunc SwitchDecor
+ I Read $./$0
+ I KillModule FvwmTaskBar
+ I Module FvwmTaskBar
+ I KillModule FvwmPager
+ I Module FvwmPager 0 2

This works to give the TaskBar and Pager the new colorset.  But no
matter what I do, I can't change the TaskBar StartIcon.  It uses the
first one it's given after fvwm starts, and it refuses to change
unless I completely re-start fvwm.  I've tried typing all the
combinations I can think of into the console, and nothing works.

Does anyone know a way to accomplish this?

I knew you will need an if-else construct, so I solved it for you in
my original message, please reread it again (it is also quoted above).
I will copy it again:

  DestroyFunc RaiseOnTop
  AddToFunc   RaiseOnTop
  + I Raise
  + I DestroyFunc ActuallyDoLayer
  + I AddToFunc   ActuallyDoLayer
  + I ThisWindow (Layer  4) + Layer 10
  + I ThisWindow (Layer 10) + Layer  4
  + I ActuallyDoLayer

Note, I don't know how this is useful, just does what you ask, in 2.4.x.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Well, it should be of course "+ I" and not "+" in the Layer lines.

  + I ThisWindow (Layer  4) + I Layer 10
  + I ThisWindow (Layer 10) + I Layer  4

This should work, place into your function:

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon
  *FvwmTaskBar: StartIcon another.xpm

It is useful to get some applications on the fly on top of everything else and
back down.

Okay, I got the point. Thanks for your patience. Now it works to get Layer 4
into Layer 10 and Layer 10 into Layer 4. But it still does not get Layer !4 into
Layer 4.

I tried the following:

	   + I ThisWindow (Layer  4) + I Layer 10
	   + I ThisWindow (!Layer 4) + I Layer  4

Result: Window stays always on Layer 4 and get's lowered !?

And
	   + I ThisWindow (Layer  4) + I Layer 10
	   + I Not (Layer 4) + I Layer  4

Result: Window get's into layer 10 and stays there.

So, what can I do? Anyway what is broken with the fvwm current layer stuff, that
I could not use it?

Greetings,
	Thomas

Try "Layer 0 10" in FvwmConsole, you'll see it does not do anything.

You may downgrade to 2.4.14 or 2.5.4 or wait until Layer command is fixed,
then use a daily snapshot.

If we're interested in submitting screenshots, where do we do it?

Not that my desktop is all that impressive, but it might serve as an
example that not everything has to be extreme... :-) It's simple and
clean.

Thanks.

Send it to me personally.  I'll take care of it.
Sometimes that may take a while, but I will do it.

This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 2440 and 3156)
--------------enig2CDAD9368EBD0882B768BF8B
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

On Win32, the alt-tab windowlist is sorted so that the most recently
focused windows are at the start of the list, e.g.:

Window 1 is focused, hit alt-tab, windows list looks like:
1 2 3 4 5
Select 4
Window 4 is focused and raised, window list is now:
4 1 2 3 5

This is very convenient when you using alt-tab to switch between a
handful of windows but have several more open.  Unfortunately, I haven't
quite been able to match this behavior in FVWM, so I'm asking for help.
 The closest I've come so far is with this:

Key Tab A   M   Prev (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus) CirculateRaise
Key Tab	A   MS  Next (CurrentPage !Iconic AcceptsFocus) CirculateRaise

DestroyFunc CirculateRaise
AddToFunc CirculateRaise "I" FlipFocus
+ "I" Raise

Unfortunately, I can only switch between the 2 most recently focused
windows this way :)

Any ideas, suggestions, etc. would be great--I'll also try to explain
again if neccesary--I'm not thinking very coherently right now, and I'm
not certain how much sense I'm making, but I wanted to send a message
now before I forget about it.

Thanks,

Hi,

wow! A lot of things have changed since I used fvwm-2.4.x the last
time (I use 2.5.5 now). Great!

I've got two questions:

1.) some windows don't get focus

If I click on mozilla -> edit -> preferences then the pref window
appears on top but it is not activated. So I can't use the keys until I
click into the window to activate it. The same happens to my
email-app sylpheed when I want to create a new message.

With nedit -> open file or openoffice -> file open dialog this does
*not* happen. Here the window gets the focus like it should.

What's the way to make all apps give their windows/dialogs the focus at
once and activate them properly?


2.) maximize

I made my own xpm images and replaced the maximize function with my own
(which is actually a ResizeMove action because I've got my FvwmTaskBar
on *top* of the screen and so the built in maximize would always place
the window on the 0,0 position and cover the TaskBar).

My question: I'd like to make a maximized window borderless. That should
word with AddToDecor somehow - but how can I toggle this back to the
original state? I am thinking of a conditional command which calls two
different decors when I press the maximize button of a window but how
could I do that?

Thank you for any help.
Felix

Short answer, if you use Next/Prev with FlipFocus you will never be
able to switch between more than 2 last windows. Think about this.
You want a way to skip some windows, i.e. advance to them without focusing
and raising them and only focus/raise the last selected window.
This is exactly what WindowList does, so just use it with needed options.

Maybe you will find the FvwmProxy module (the name will be changed) in
2.5.5 useful to you. But to do what you want you should also use a new
"Key -Meta_L" functionlaty (execute command on key release) and this new
functionality is likely to be removed, since it does not work well.

Mikhael.

Use "EWMHBaseStruts 0 0 30 0" in 2.5.5 for the internal Maximize to work
like you want.

I would not do this with decors, I would use "Next (XCalc) Style $n ...".
This potentially changes the appearance of all windows with this name, but
you can't do anything about this until we have individual window styles.
It works pretty well in most of situations.

I copy the following text from my message to this list on October 2002
(with small change, in 2.5.5 "NoBorder" syntax was changed to "!Borders"):

====

It is possible to do with 2.4.x too, but the if-else is tricky in 2.4.x
and additionally BorderWidth should be hadcoded and handles are forced:

  DestroyFunc MaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
  + I Style $n NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize true

  DestroyFunc UnmaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   UnmaximizeFullScreen
  + I WindowId "$w" Maximize false
  + I Style $n Title, Handles, BorderWidth 5

  Key F11  A  SC  Pick MaximizeFullScreen
  Key F12  A  SC  Pick UnmaximizeFullScreen

2.5.x has no such problems (except that individual styles would not hurt):
  
  DestroyFunc MaximizeFullScreen
  AddToFunc   MaximizeFullScreen
  + I ThisWindow (Maximized) Style $n Title, Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n !Title, !Borders
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
  + I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
  + I Maximize

  Key F11  A  SC  Pick MaximizeFullScreen

Mikhael.

Hmm.  Yes, this is what I want (at least wrt window ordering)--I saw
this in the man page but for some odd reason I ended up trying it as a
style (which doesn't really make sense anyway.)  Thanks!

Well, that's a big step ahead, but this brings up a few more (relatively
minor) things that I can't seem to find anything about in the man page.
I'd prefer to have the windows temporarily raised when I cycle through
them, if possible, and I'd like to disable the temporary pointer warping
that occurs when you select a menu item with the keyboard.

Is there a way to do either of these?

Thanks again,

Please post your line with "Style * IconBox" that you think worked before,
but does not work now. The man page contains several working examples.

Thanks for this! Works absolutely great with a task bar on top.

I tested your code and it's also great but as you mentioned *all*
windows with the same name are affected (e.g. if I open two windows with
nedit and one's title is "nedit - Untitled" whereas the other is changed
to"nedit- Untitled (modified)" then the windows are treated seperately).

So, I'll wait for individual window styles.

Let me add that fvwm-2.5.5 is really a great thing. I had stopped
working with 2.4.x half a year ago and used gnome instead. But now I
come back to fvwm because gnome/metacity isn't that stable and fast as I
need it to be - and now with fvwm-2.5.5 I find a very fast, very
customizable window manager. For me the main thing are the changes to
FvwmTaskBar. Thanks,
 Felix

Hi all,

Am I correct in assuming that the shadowed font feature doesn't 
work with anti-aliased text rendered through xft?
If so, is there any likelyhood of getting the two to work together 
in the future?
I'm using fvwm 2.5.4 on a Debian system with xfree 4.2.3 and a 
fairly recent freetype2.

TIA,

-R.

I switched to fvwm about a month ago, but i have began to=20
love it. After some hard work, it becomes more and more=20
beautiful.

However, I came to a problem. I used fvwmiconman to show the
windows on one page and set:
fvwmiconman: format "%t"=20
to show the title of a windows in the title bar.

Then all the 'rxvt' only show 'rxvt' in title. They are same in
"name","icon name","class","resource",only different in windows id.
But it's ugly to show the windows id in title, so it's very hard to
discriminate them. Are there some way to show more infomation?
For example, rxvt(1) for the first one, rxvt(2) for the one runs=20
after rxvt(1).

Thank you,
dion

In 2.5.x use:

  Style * IndexedWindowName, IndexedIconName

But I use 2.4.14...
In the homepage of fvwm, I find 2.4.14 is the latest stable release
and 2.5.5 is an unstable release. I have little experience is fvwm,
so I am afraid to use an unstable release.

thank you
dion

Both features worked nicely together from the start. There were problems
with MultiPixmap and shadowed text, but even this works well in cvs now.

I suppose you use colorsets for defining fg, bg and fgsh of your text.
Otherwise text shadow is not drawn.

Try this:

  Colorset 1 bg gray30, fg gray80
  Style * Colorset 1
  Style * Font "Shadow=2:xft:Verdana:Medium:size=12:minspace=true"

If you have any problems please post relevant configuration that uses
colorsets and does not work for you (after running the daily snapshot).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ah, I thought I'd tried all the likely variants, but I still had the syntax
wrong (no colon after the shadow spec stuff).
It's gorgeous. Thanks very much for the lightening response.

Hi,

  If I use Acrobat Reader to open a fullscreen PDF file and then press "Esc" to return to the normal state. Acrobat won't move anymore.

  But it can move in kwin and metacity. Why?

Hi there - I've just discovered shadowed fonts in fvwm (CVS) and am
playing with them happily but not very successfully because of my utter
cluelessness about colours.  

Has anyone a colourscheme which really works well that they are prepared
to share?



While I'm at it - just a word of thanks from a humble and clueless user
to those who do so much to make this most gorgeous of window-managers
what it is.  

with thanks and best wishes for the new year

Hi dion

I was afraid too but I did it and I am completely happy with 2.5.5. For
a couple of days I am using it now and I there was no bug at all. Enjoy
the new features!

I use the $PROMPT_COMMAND variable in bash (and others?) to set my term
titles to something descriptive.
This is what I have in ~/.bashrc:
 [ $TERM == "linux" ] \
 && unset  PROMPT_COMMAND \
 || export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;`whoami` | `basename ${DIRSTACK}`\007\033k\033\134"'

This will put $USER and the current directory, seperated by a "|", in your *term titles.
You may strip the last "\033\034" if you don't use screen(1).
This helps me keep track of my terms in FvwmIconMan. Another option is
to use screen - then you won't need to open so many terms ;)

Cheers.

Hi,

  I've been using FVWM for several month and get quite involved with it.
  But now I have a strange problem.
  Some of my windows will disappear unexpectly sometimes.
  I don't know when and which will disappear. It seems the problem is not easy to reproduce.

  I only know that rxvt is the most often to disappear of all and the most likely occasion is when I restart FVWM.
  Once the windows vanished, I can't get it back! It's not in the WindowList or else where. Nor can I get it back with a "All () MoveToPage".
  It just closed! Why?

Use this command to see if the window is really gone:

xlsclients | grep rxvt

If the window is really gone, perhaps rxvt printed an error message
and exited.  Find stderr for fvwm and look there.  Stderr might
be on your console, or you may have redirected fvwm's stderr when
you started it:

fvwm2 >/tmp/fvwm.out 2>&1

If that still doesn't help, perhaps rxvt core dumped.

Make sure core dumps are enabled (man ulimit), then look for
$HOME/core.

I can't reproduce the problem.

the window...anything else.

If you open this file:
http://www.pragma-ade.com/present/talks/pre-mml.pdf
with Acrobat Reader 5.05 on Redhat Linux 8.0 with FVWM 2.5.4

It will change to fullscreen and you press Esc, it change to normal state
and won't move anymore.

I solved the problem just now with a 

Style "AcroRead"	VariablePosition, VariableUSPosition

But I'm still curious: 
How can Acrobat Reader tell FVWM to use "FixedPosition" style?
EWMHints?

hi all

after some 6 years using fvwm 1 i made the switch to fvwm2, but i seem to hit a couple
of silly errors on my own. sorry if this is old stuff for you.

i compiled 2.4.14 without problems.

when i start/restart fvwm2 i get a long delay (1 minute or so). how can i fix that?

i translated my old trusty .fvwmrc to .fvwm2rc and i got similar behavior, but i'd like to add
transparency, and if possible shaped titlebars and buttons. any pointer to a example .fvwm2rc
with this enabled?

thanks,

m.

If you follow these suggestion and sit with FvwmConsole for several
minutes, you may find what is good to you:

  * preferably use bold font or xft font
  * try different shadow sizes (1, 2) and offsets (0, 1, 2)
  * preferably use light foreground color and not very dark background
  * define shadow color (try: fgsh black) if the evaluated one is not good

If you use black text color it is pretty difficult (but possible) to
define good shadow, because a human eye only likes dark shadows, so start
with white text color or rgb:e0/e0/e0 or similar.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I think, if you run "xwininfo -size" on this window this will answer your
question. (I don't run proprietary programs myself to test this.)

Here is what xwininfo says. I can't find any clue:

xwininfo: Window id: 0x180013a "pre-mml.pdf"

  Normal window size hints:
      Program supplied location: 0, 0
      Program supplied size: 800 by 600
      Program supplied window gravity: NorthWestGravity
  No zoom window size hints defined

Then my guess was wrong. The +0+0 position is respected or not respected
depending on NoPPosition or UsePPosition. Not quite related.

I suppose you can reproduce this problem with no config at all.
Probably others have more ideas.

P.S. Please respect the reply style used on this and other technical
lists: put your message after the quoted lines and manually remove all
unrelated lines from quotes like mailing list signatures.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I agree.  I'm an amateur, but 2.5.5 compiles (RH 7.3, Pentium II @ 300mHz) 
fine and runs great.  No problems at all.

I have fvwm 2.4.14 running on a dual head display (matrox mg2).  In my 
setup file I can scroll by a hole page via the commands:

Key Left  A C   Scroll -100 0
Key Right A C   Scroll +100 +0
Key Up    A C   Scroll +0 -100
Key Down  A C   Scroll +0 +100

I have found that if I get a single viewport fairly full of mozilla 
windows and I try to use the control key to scroll into that viewport, 
sometimes, fvwm scrolls past the viewport (as though I had hit the 
control key twice).  Sometimes it even jumps 3 screens (particularly if 
both the viewports it is jumping across are quite full of windows.

This is not very repeatable.  If I scroll around a lot (using the same 
hotkeys), it seems to get better until the problem completely goes away. 
  Then later, it will return again.

So far, I haven't been able to recreate it on a single headed display.

I haven't spent much time on it yet.  I just wanted to see first if 
anyone had seen the same problem or knew what might cause it.

I have several servers all showing the same problem.  I have redhat 8.0 
and fvwm 2.4.14.

On the console (:0.0) after running a session for about 2 weeks, I lose 
the ability to launch new programs from fvwm.  If I open a shell window 
and try to launch any program (xcalc, for example), I get an error:

Error: Can't open display: :0

There is not the usual Xauth message indicating that the connection was 
refused etc.  Just the message showing the failure.  "xauth list" shows 
a cookie for the display that looks like it is supposed to.

If I do:

export DISPLAY=hostname:0.0

then I can launch programs from the shell window (via tcp), but if I 
again do:

export DISPLAY=:0

It still fails.  So its like unix access to the server doesn't work, but 
tcp access still does.

If I try to restart fvwm, the session crashes and I have to log back in 
again.  Then the session works for a number of days again and then 
mysteriously fails again.

I thought of always starting fvwm with -d hostname:0.0, but no luck.  It 
still forces the DISPLAY variable to :0.0.  Besides, the unix connection 
is supposed to be more efficient so it would be nice if I could get it 
to work.

I don't know if this is an fvwm or an X problem but I wanted to see if 
anyone else had seen it or knows what it is.  And I don't think I've 
ever seen it on a stock (gnome) redhat box.

I read everything that comes into the fvwm mailing list and
I can't remember a problem report like this.

I'd suspect some kind of memory leak in the X server.
Maybe you should run:

ipcs -a

every once in a while for shared memory.  And run top
or ps for conventional memory.

Is there an abbreviation for using Hyper or Super as modifier key when
setting up Key/Mouse function bindings?  

I can't find any mention of this in the man pages, the mailing list
archives are not searchable and google isn't helping....

It is system dependent. Run xmodmap to see which modifier number is your
Super keys. In my system it is mod4, so I would do:

  Key C A 4 Exec exec xcalc

My Menu key is not defined as modifier, but searching for xmodmap in FAQ
suggests that I should run the following to make it a modifier:

  xmodmap -e "add Mod3 = Menu"

Mikhael.

Thanks!  I'm off and running now....

On a related question, is there a way to tell FVWM to *ignore* a
particular modifier?  I often hit numlock to do some numeric entry and
then find none of my shortcuts work, e.g., the default binding


    Key Left A CM GotoPage -1p +0p

fails because numlock (mod2 on my host) is set.

Look in the man page for...IgnoreModifiers.

I have a problem with PlaceAgain command on windows which were
previously iconified.  If I iconify a window, move (GotoDesk) to another
desktop then deiconify the window and do PlaceAgain for it, the window
is moved to the desk where it was created.

I read the CMD_PlaceAgain function code (placement.c) and I think the
problem is in PlaceWindow function invocation. It's called with
SGET_START_DESK(style). I don't understand what it really is but looks
like a desktop number the window was created on incremented by one (but
only for desktop numbers bigger than 0 - a kind of black magic for me).
The "start desk" number is changed in PlaceWindow (line 677 in CVS
version from 31.12) back to the "fvwm desk number" and then the window
desktop number is set to it.

I tried to change PlaceWindow call in CMD_PlaceAgain function so that it
has 0 instead of SGET_START_DESK(style). 
The window placement in PlaceWindow is changed (I have no idea why) only:
"if(SUSE_START_ON_DESK(sflags) && Desk && flags.do_honor_starts_on_page)"
(line 676).

So when Desk == 0 it works as I expected, but it's probably not the
solution.

Maybe someone with a better code knowledge could look at it?

On the michael-desk-1152x900 screenshot on the
screenshot page of fvwm.org it shows windows with
titles and icons. I want to have that, but I am doing
something wrong: titles but no icons...
All my windows have 5 buttons, because I have:
...
AddButtonStyle 1 Pixmap button.xpm 		#HVW1
AddButtonStyle 2 Pixmap button-max.xpm		#HVW1
AddButtonStyle 4 Pixmap button-iconify.xpm	#HVW1
AddButtonStyle 6 Pixmap button-close.xpm	#HVW1

Style "*" MWMButtons  # button relief follows the
state

Mouse 0 3 N Stick
ButtonStyle 3 - Clear MWMDecorStick
ButtonStyle 3 Inactive          Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp          Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown        Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 ToggledInactive   Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp   Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown Vector 4 75x25@0
75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
...
Can someone give me a pointer on how to get an icon on
there that the executing program sets?
Thanks!
Hugo.

You need to bind an action to the button or it won't show.

For example, like you did on button 3 with the Mouse
command.

If I understand you correctly you want to show a mini icon in a titlebar:

  ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon

By default, if the program itself supplies a mini icon (using EWMH) it is
shown in the MiniIcon button in 2.5.x. But pre-EWMH applications do not
set a mini icon hint. You should define it yourself, like:

  Style * MiniIcon mini/unknown.xpm
  Style XTerm MiniIcon mini/terminal.xpm

Mikhael.

Check to see if the unix socket is still there:

Maybe some overly helpful /tmp cleaning program has removed it.
How precise is that "two weeks" time measurement? Like clockwork,
or just touchy-feely?

Work around it in your .xsession (or .xinitrc, depending) by setting
$DISPLAY there.

More likely it doesn't touch the $DISPLAY variable at all. So all your

See if my /tmp cleaning idea holds.
