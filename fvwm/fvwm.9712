I use the following command to start X on my Sparc system with a ffb and cgsix
frame buffers:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Start X using the Sun supplied X server and set the color depth for
# the ffb to be 24bits
/usr/openwin/bin/xinit -- /usr/openwin/bin/X :0 -dev /dev/fb0 defdepth 24 \
	-dev /dev/cgsix0 -auth /homes/boyda/.xsun.molecule:0

I assume that you are referring to the Creator graphics on the Ultra
hardware platform.

The Creator will only run in 24 bit mode.  However, it also supplies 8
bit PseudoColor visuals as well.  That is why it cannot run more than
1280x1024 even though it has 5 megs of video RAM.

By default, the default visual is 8 bit.  The script that was referenced
earlier in the thread changed the default visual. If you are using CDE,
it is not trivial to change the way that the X server is invoked,
especially without root access.

You can also specify the visual that FVWM attempts to use.  See the man
page for details.

Greetings.

I'm new to this list and to linux in general, but I suppose this would be
the right place to ask this :)
I recently installed Linux (Redhat 4.2), and I've decided to start with the
fvwm window manager, as I understand it's easy to work with, yet highly
customizeable.
What I'm wondering is, should I use 1.24 or the latest 2.x ? As 1.24 is the
latest "official" version, that's what I have. But does 2.x use the same
configurations ? Like, can I use the old config options + new ones, or are
the two versions not 100% compatible ? Also, are there a lot of bugs in 2.x ?

Thanks for any advice and guidance into the wonderfull world of linux :)

Use the latest 2.x (2.0.46, I think).  The configurations are different, and 
doubtless there are bugs in 2.x, but you aren't likely to notice them.  RedHat 
comes with TheNextLevel, a set of configurations for fvwm95 (a modified fvwm2) 
which you may find convenient to start off with.

Hi FVWM-list!

I think I have found a bug:  I use SmartPlacement (and 
SmartPlacementIsReallySmart), and at the same time I have a FvwmIconMan 
and a FvwmButtons module, both are StaysOnTop.  When placing new 
windows, Fvwm should avoid overlap with StaysOnTop windows, this works 
fine with FvwmButtons, but apparently the smartplacement algorithm 
cannot see the FvwmIconMan window, it is not even avoided as a normal 
window would be.

Below I have attached a rather minimal .fvwmrc that shows the problemm 
it is too minimal to be of any other use :-)

[Brady Montz: I reported this earlier to the list, and promised you to 
send a minimal .fvwm2rc if I could reproduce it with 2.0.46 and 
FvwmIconMan 1.0.  Well after upgrading I must say that I can, and that I 
have not been able to modify my config so that I do not see it, although 
I didn't try very hard.]

Best regards, and thanks for any help.

Jakob

After a hiatus from tracking fvwm releases, and from this list, I've
just upgraded to 2.0.46. I like the new features (especially the
FvwmIconMan magic that lets me create a taskbar), but I'm having some
strange results with my FvwmBacker setup (which is unchanged from
2.0.45 in my config). 

- The -solid option produces results that look like a bad xor
  value. *FvwmBackerDesk 0 -solid steelblue produces a(n aweful) tan
  color, while *FvwmBackerDesk 2 -solid white results in a solid black
  background. This happens regardless of the XORValue setting (default
  or 255)

- lines like
    
	*FvwmBackerDesk 1 /usr/X11R6/bin/xbackdrop
	*FvmwBackerDesk 3 xpmroot /usr/local/lib/backdrops/arena.xpm

  fail silently, while

        *FvwmBackerDesk 4 /usr/X11R6/bin/xpmroot /usr/local/lib/backdrops/leaves.xpm

  results in 

        [FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed:
        /usr/X11R6/bin/xpmroot /usr/local/lib/backdrops/spacebg.xpm
        No such file or directory

My environment is Linux, with MetroX 3.1.8. My display runs in 16 bit
mode. All of this behaved as documented under 2.0.45. Did I miss
something?

There is a utility out there for converting your files from version 1 to
version 2.  I forget what it is called.

I disagree about TheNextLevel; I don't like it at all.  And it is fvwm-95
I believe.  Also, don't quote me on it for a few more days, but I'm pretty
sure Red Hat has abandoned TheNextLevel in Red Hat 5.0.

It is a bit yucky.  On the other hand, it's nice to have something that works 
out of the box, and TNL does that.  It uses FvwmM4 quite neatly to fiddle with 
menus depending on what executables happen to be installed.

I hope Red Hat replace it with something similarly usable.

Me too, I disagree. Me too, I think these would be good news. But no,
the replacement is called AnotherLevel. Just another ...

In fact, must give to the Caesar what's his. TheNextLevel is a Good
Thing (TM) for newbies (they get inteligent selective wm start, menus
creation) or for scripting genies (they get a new toy :-). But with poor
half-hackers, as myself, a simple, a la X11 distrib, .xinitrc is the
best thing.

At least we can get the icons whitout even the effort to search them on
the net :-).

The Next Level is a good place to start if you are already familiar with
Win95 and want to migrate to X. It makes the transition a little
easier, even if it is little more than a crutch for newbies. But sooneror
later, most users will dispose of the task bar vastly inferior to the
pager) and either hack it beyond recognition or migrate
to another WM. 

My impression is that patches/updates are being released for fvwm2, and
fvwm2 probably has a brighter future. It's very similar to fvwm1x though.

I think this is a bug with FvwmIconMan rather than with CleverPlacement
(SmartPlacementIsReallySmart).  There are some flags which must be set on
windows so that their state is known.  i.e. are they visible, iconified,
unmapped, etc.  CleverPlacement must know if a window is iconified or
unmapped so it knows how to handle it.  I believe that FvwmIconMan is
setting the ICONIFIED and/or ICON_UNMAPPED flags wrong, so
CleverPlacement believes that the window isn't actually there.

I may be wrong, but perhaps the maintainer of FvwmIconMan can take a look
at this?

Only if you consider a poor imitation of a so-so interface "working".

I've been a Windows / Win32 programmer for 10 years now.  I am _not_ an
habitual MS basher *.  But Windows95 is only a good gui when compared to
Win 3.1.  There are a number of GUIs that are prettier and more useful.


* I have been known to wonder aloud (from time to time) what the folks at
MS are using for brains -- but that's another story.

David

Well, sure.  Fvwm95 has some nice features which fvwm2 could usefully steal, 
however.  The TaskBar hiding feature is nice, for example.  I have an 
FvwmButtons with a bunch of things stuck in it (pager, xclipboard, etc.) which 
sits at the bottom of my screen.  It would be nice (as an option) to have it 
disappear like the taskbar can, so I'd get at it by moving my mouse over it.  
Better than StaysOnTop, because it would only take a couple of pixels.  
Similarly, I can see this would be nice for icon boxes.

In practice, you can come pretty close to attaining this kind of effect by
using a keybinding for the 'lower' and 'raise' functions. Provided you
don't have a lot of windows on top of each other (and the whole point of
virtual deskspace is that you can place the windows side by side) this
will popup whatver button device you have ; it 'pops-down' the one in
front, 
so this will bring your button bars/etc to the foreground Provided that
they aren't concealed by multiple windows..
Usually, because the
bars/buttons  are in the corner, they aren't covered by more
than one window at a time.

I guess so.  For that matter, I could bind a key out of the large number of 
spare keys I've got on the keyboard such that pressing the key would select 
the window.

As a user interface feature, though, I'd still maintain that Windows95's 
taskbar hiding is pretty neat.

In terms of a more general mechanism, how about allowing any window to have an 
alternative dormant representation (which would normally have StaysOnTop, and 
would ordinarily be on the edge of the screen).  When the pointer moves over 
such a dormant window, the active window reappears, and when the pointer is 
moved away, then after a decent interval, the window is unmapped and the 
dormant window reappears.  So the dormant window is a placeholder, with no 
buttons or anything (since it'll disappear as soon as you move the pointer 
over it, so you can't interact with it).

Don't know how this dormant window ought to be specified: width, length, 
colour etc., ought to be configurable.  Some people might want more (how about 
a version of Shaded windows done in this way?).

Windows95 allows people to drag the taskbar from one edge to another, but that 
seems unnecessary glitz.  Something like these dormant windows would be really 
handy, I think.

	Hello list, I just wanted to submit a feature request and/or hear
from anyone who may have already made this modification or who can point out
a way to do what I want with the existing code...

	I was hoping that FvwmWharf could include labelling functionality
like FvwmButtons.  I perform a lot of ssh logins as different users to 
different hosts and I wanted a certain subset of them to go into a Dock.  I
use fvwm buttons right now with one button per host that logs in a me.
What I wanted was to make a Wharf that looks almost identical but
when you click on the host it explodes sideways giving a selection of
which user I want to login as.  The problem is that without labels I would 
actually have to make a separate XPM with text in it for every single 
dock icon.  I really don't want to do this.  If FvwmWharf could label the 
pixmaps like FvmwButtons can, that would be perfect.

	I know I could write a script to concatenate a string onto the bottom
of an xpm en masse but I would still have to name, store and configure a huge
number of individual xpm files for this purpose.

	Thanks in advance,

Where are these flags? All FvwmIconMan does is call XMapWindow. Fvwm should be 
able to figure out the iconified status of the FvwmIconMan windows without any 
more than that.

I don't know if this  is the correct place to post this or not, but here
goes:

I'm running fvwm 1.24r-25 under the Debian distribution of Linux 2.0.27.
I have a general problem with non-showing text in menubars boxes, which
is particularly bad with Netscape (Navigator 3.04, Communicator 4.04) -
but definitely shows up with other programs too, such as xman, gv, and
the like.

Sometimes the text can be made to appear by sweeping the mouse cursor
over where its supposed to appear. Other times, I can sweep another
window across the text area and the text appears as the window passes.

Is there something obvious in fvwm configuration I'm overlooking?

Thanks for reading this. Any help will be appreciated.

I'm not sure who is responsible for setting these flags, but when
CleverPlacement is trying to figure out the state of I window, I have
tests such as if(window->flags & ICONIFIED) and if(!(window->flags &
ICON_UNMAPPED)) to determine the status of the window.  For some reason, I
think the FvwmIconMan window has bogus values for these flags.
It has been a few months since I looked at this code, and perhaps it is
something else, but if I remember correctly this is what is confusing
CleverPlacement.

Mark Hewitt commented that tkgoodstuff does all that I asked for, and he's 
quite right.  Don't know why I haven't been using it all along, but the 8.0 
version seems to work fine.  It's a bit offputting that it seems to be 
unsupported at present (the programmer having given up development), but 
presumably someone will take over to keep it working with subsequent Tcl/Tk 
releases.

It's not lightweight, but if you use Tcl/Tk applications anyway (as I do), 
then the libraries will be shared, so it's not so bad.

Hi there.

I (well, actually a friend of mine) would like to realize the following:

write a function (and then of course do some key and mouse mapping to it)
that lets the buttonbar disappear or reappear.

I don't want to kill (restart) the buttonbar, because it swallows a lot of other stuff.
I just want it out of (back into) sight.

Any ideas ?

Thanks in advance.

I think you want to bind your event to something like 

	Next [FvwmButtons] Iconify

	along with
	Style "FvwmButtons" NoIcon

Or if you want 2 seperate events use one with Iconify -1 and the other
with Iconify +1

Hope that helps,
Brad

And, not only has tkgoodstuff's developer given up, the mailing lists have 
gone too.  (I'm not trying to blame the developer here, it's perfectly 
reasonable to do this---it's just annoying!)  Any chance of hpc.uh.edu hosting 
a list?  Perhaps tkgoodstuff being an official contributed fvwm module, so 
development can continue by members of this list?

I've got it working much as I want, but there are some annoyances.  

There doesn't seem to be a way of reordering items in preferences.  For 
example, if I decide I want the clock to go after the pager, instead of 
before. Not too bad, since I always have my trusty text editor, but I ought to 
be able to drag it.

I'd quite like to use the WindowList client, since it looks more fun than 
fvwm's, but I haven't found a way of doing it nicely yet.  I don't want it in 
the main tkgoodstuff, because I've got too much else there.  A button which 
popped up a client would be OK, but that doesn't seem to work (I just get an 
empty window); perhaps I've just got the syntax wrong?

Similarly, a dedicated tkgoodstuff would be OK (possibly better), but I can't 
seem to persuade it to work properly.  If I have it auto-hidden on the right 
hand side of the screen, it's so narrow that I can't read much of the window 
names, and if I have it at the top of the screen, then it's so thin that it 
only gives one line of windows.  If I explicitly resize it to about three 
lines, then it looks great; so how on earth can I get it this size by default? 
 None of the preference options seem to do the right thing: the WindowLists's 
geometry doesn't seem to do anything, and the main tkgoodstuff geometry is 
ignored, since I want it in edge mode.  *sigh* So what *do* I need to set?

Well I don't know what version you are running but I'm using version 8,
and I know it lets me drag buttons around.  Just hold left mouse down on
the one you want to move and drag it on top of the one that you want it to
come after i.e if you have buttons 1 2 3 and want to make the order 1 3 2,
you just drag button three onto 1 and then the preferences screen will
list them as 1 3 2

That is one of the reasons that I switched back to FvwmIconMan, the other
is once I had a large number of windows on the list it stopped adding them
and then the list goes blank

Can't help on this one always dumps when I try to run it in edge mode,
although it may just be my configuration.

You're right.  It's just quite picky about when you release the button, but it 
does work.

Oh dear.  This probably won't affect me, since I rarely have 10 windows open, 
let alone a large number.

I also tried to pop up the client but just got a blank panel.

Instead I use a Panel and a PutPanel, something like:

Panel Windows
Client WindowList
EndPanel
PutPanel Windows

also a option for the geometry of the windowlist:

TKGSet PutPanelWindows(geometry) 1060x36+92-0

Works a treat.

I'm hoping I've missed an option so maybe someone can help me out, I want
to do a maximize 100 98, to leave room for somethings like, xbiff and the
clock

But I keep those things at the top of my screen not the bottom, and when I
maxamize the window jumps up to top left, and then I have to move it.
Does anyone know of a way I can counteract this behavior

Well, those are just internal flags in fvwm. It's responsible for making sure
they are correct.

Hello,

Hopefully a quick question here...

I am using the same .fvwm2rc at work (Solaris) and at home (Linux).
However, when I resize or move a window at home, the mouse does not
"let go" of the edges after I release the mouse button -> I have
to click again to make it let go.  On Solaris, I just drag the window
border and let go to have it resize.  

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
John

I am using the same .fvwm2rc at work (Solaris) and at home (Linux).
However, when I resize or move a window at home, the mouse does not
"let go" of the edges after I release the mouse button -> I have
to click again to make it let go.  On Solaris, I just drag the window
border and let go to have it resize.  

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
John

I have no problems with tkgoodstuff being discussed here (and on
fvwm-workers) as long as it stays FVWM related.  I don't know how
applicable tkgoodstuff is to other window managers, so this may eventually
cause problems.  I'm happy to create other lists if there is a real need.

Funnily enough I have thought the same and came up with a solution, it uses 
FvwmAuto:

Style FvwmButtons Sticky, NoTitle, CirculateSkip, HandleWidth 0, MouseFocus
AddToFunc my_hide_in    "I" Current [FvwmButtons] Move 0p 880p
+                       "I" Current [FvwmButtons] Raise
AddToFunc my_hide_out   "I" Next [FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Move 0p 1000p
FvwmAuto 0 my_hide_in my_hide_out

The coordinates of the Move's move my FvwmButtons partly off the bottom so that 
just the swallowed FvwmIconMan is visible, you will need to adjust these. It 
would be nice to use AnimatedMove (hint hint).  Also it doesn't use StaysOnTop 
but it does raise when the mouse enters.  The hiding/revealing happens without 
delay since you can only give one timeout to FvwmAuto.  I tried the one FvwmAuto 
line with

FvwmAuto 0 my_hide_in
FvwmAuto 500 Nop my_hide_out

to get a more graceful operation, but it didn't work well.  my_hide_out really 
should be "IfPrev [FvwmButtons] Next [FvwmButtons CirculateHit] Move 0p 1000p" 
but there is no IfPrev command (yet).

N.B. sometime this fails to hide the FvwmButtons window, it never fails to show 
the window but sometimes moving the mouse from the FvwmButtons window to another 
leaves the FvwmButtons fully on screen, I guess that FvwmAuto is not getting the 
focus out event.

Cheers,
Tim Phipps.

P.S. sorry the headers of this message aren't right, I'm not getting the mailing

Hello fvwmers,

I am using "ButtonStyle n Vector" to draw my title-bar buttons.

My problem is that when I'm trying to minimize the space of the title bars
using:

Style "flatness"    UseDecor flatness,Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4
Style "*"           UseStyle flatness

AddToDecor flatness
+ TitleStyle -- flat
+ BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+ HilightColor Gold PaleTurquoise4


I am loosing the structure I draw on the title-bar buttons.

I tried to draw that same using 10x10 pallet (instead of 100x100) with no luck.


Any way to enjoy both short borders and my own customized title-bar buttons?

Thanks in advance,
Yehuda.

Hello,
If there's somebody interested: here is a little (and actually very crude)
patch for those poor souls like myself who still have to run 256 colors
mode but like FvwmWharf module. It somewhat reduces its hunger for colours
(not completely, but with this and with texture buttons and with the
original AfterStep icons my fvwm uses 88 colours instead of 200++). It
requires the original ColorLimit patch, of course.
If somebody would make this better (what, I suppose, is not difficult for
any competent programmer - I'm definitely _not_ the one) please answer me
by e-mail, 'cause unfortunately I'm not on this list.

BTW, if there's somebody using fvwm95, I've got this patch for it as well,
but it's a bit bigger - about 20 kb.

Regards,
Vladimir

Having perused the FAQ and mailing list archives I notice that
StubbornIcons is obsoleted in 2.x. I had been trying for 2 weeks to make
that function work and no amount of reading the man page returned any
positive results. IMO I found it to be an excellent function as it saves 
clicks,going to the pager first,then de-iconifying the icon onto the
desktop you want it on.
Is this a permanent change or could it,or a similarly behaved command,be
incorporated back into FVWM?

Hi,

I have a programm "xisp" which I use for dialup. This programm can react
to SIGUSR1 (connect) and SIGUSR2 (disconnect), so I want to have a
menuoption to connect/disconnect remotely.

So far, I tried this:

I added these two lines to my menudefinition:

+ "connect" connect-xisp
+ "disconnect" exec kill -SIGUSR2 `cat /home/martinb/.xisppid`

AddToFunc       "connect-xisp"
+       "I"     None ["X-ISP"] exec xisp
+       "I"     Exec kill -SIGUSR1 `cat /home/martinb/.xisppid`

Disconnecting works quite right, but the function connect-xisp has some
problems.

If xisp is already running, it works well.
But if xisp is not started yet, fvwm will start it and the kill -SIGUSR1
gets executed too fast. 

The function should wait until the windows gets mapped, or something
similar if I change the startline to start xisp iconic.

Is there a way to do so? 

Also sometimes xisp doesn't get started. The cursor changes from X to O
and back to X (you know what I mean :-), but xisp won't start...

This is fvwm 2.0.46
 
Ciao,
	Martin

I have a similar problem in trying to start ImageMagick from a menu in 
2.0.46. The ImageMagick docs say to use:        display logo:
to start from menu. The other way to start it is do run "display" from an
xterm.
What happens when executed from menu is the program dies as soon as the
programs logo is loaded. It works fine when executed from xterm.
A workaround I found was to create a shell script that executes "display"
and call that from the menu. It works. So perhaps a similar workaround MAY
work for you.

Unfortunately it does not :-( To be more concrete: xisp sometmies won't
start if I started it via the menu then closed it and now want to start it
again.

Starting it from a rxvt always works.

I'm not exactly sure why (a previous exchange of mails about spawning
execs revealed to me I'm grossly ignorant of the subject), but
ImageMagick works just fine for me (RHLinux4.1, Linux 2.0.30,
fvwm2.0.46) using:

+ "ImageMagick" Exec exec display &

whereas

+ "ImageMagick" Exec display

acts as you describe. Haven't the foggiest regarding the reason for
this.

As for the question that started the thread, it's a shame Wait won't
work under the circumstances.

One really nice feature of twm that was cut in the creation of fvwm was
the use of non X11 standard cursors by the window manager.  Twm allows
for the user to set a cursor and mask file instead of just a reference to
a standard X cursor.  

I'm not sure how many others would also like to be able to create and use
there own cursors for use with fvwm, but it would be a nice feature (and
hopefully an easy one to add)...

Then again it probably isn't very high on the list of things to get done
:)

Just a though.

   I'd agree that it would be a nice add.on feature.  How about support
   for animated cursors?  So the user could specify a sequence of cursors
   to be used (just thinking aloud here).

Or instead of writing a lot of extra code you could just put a line like
this in your Init function
 Exec xsetroot -cursor /home/bgiaccio/lib/graphics/cur2.xbm
/home/bgiaccio/lib/graphics/cur2.mask &


Where depending on your X server you can use between 32x32 to 64x64.
Although this just gives you a simple black and white non animated cursor
it is better than using the standard cursors all the time.

Hope this is what you are looking for.
Brad

P.S.
I created my cursor in a few minutes with the bitmap program that should
be in your distribution and then just hit invert to create the mask for
it.

Try adding the following in your .fvwm2rc file:

DestroyFunc	"MyMaximize"
AddToFunc	"MyMaximize"
+ "I"	Maximize	100 98
+ "I"	Move		  0  2

Then, instead of using "Maximize 100 98" elsewhere in your .fvwm2rc, you
can just use "MyMaximize" and you should get the desired behavior.

Is that icky 'FVWM:' thing in the subject line something that is done as

  Is it possible to duplicate the OLWM pin sticking functionality? I am
running under OpenWindows and some things (like Find windows) like to
disappear unless you stick them.  I looked at the man page, but couldn't
find anything besides the sticking that transcends the virtual screens.

(1) Culture. Fairly normal on mailing lists.

(2) Yes. It means that if you get many many emails per day you can use
filtering programs to slip all the *FVWM* posts into a folder until
you're ready to read them.

The list members wanted it; I added it.  Majordomo _can_ do this to the
subject, if configured to do so.  If you've never seen it, you must not be
on many mailing lists.

I don't like it either, but then I use procmail and just remove it when I
filter my mail.

Well, IMHO, the FVWM: prefix on the Subject: line (this doesn't appear
on the fvwm-workers list, by the way) is a godsend; I can glance at the
subject line to figure which mailing list the message comes from.  If
you subscribe to multiple mailing lists, you may eventually find this a
help.

Majordomo DOES add the prefix, if the prefix isn't already there.  But
only if it is told to do so in its configuration.  The FVWM95 mailing
list also adds a prefix (FVWM95).

Hi,

  I am running an Octane (SGI) with Irix 6.4, using SGI's 7.2 compilers.
I've found the following bug which causes a "bus error" on my machine,
but probably works fine on others depending on your compiler.

There is a variable called "PPosOverride" which is decalred in fvwm.c
as "Boolean PPosOverride".  It is used in the following files as
"extern Bool PPosOverride": placement.c misc.c and events.c.

  The problem is with my compiler, Bool and Boolean are not the 
same size.  Changing all "extern Bool PPosOverride" to use Boolean
instead fixes the problem.  Again this seems to be specific to my
new compiler, because it worked fine with my old (7.1) compiler.

  Ian.

You could easily configure procmail to filter fvwm (and other mailling
lists) in their own folder or spool file without using the subject line 
at all.

This allowws us to sort on what type of mail it is. If you
notice, in my headers the email appears to be from you,
]not the fvwm list. So sorting by the from header wouldn't help
any. Having a consistent subject line is a great help though.

Configuring Majordomo to put From, To or some field to the mailinglist,
instead of whatever the users sends to would help too.

Wow! What a response. I feel that I should give some feedback and some
background.

I am from Mr. Galbraith's school of thought. I filter email via the address
using Eudora. (Yes windows... I have not researched X mail clients yet.)
The subject header is not significant to my automatic filtering method. I
now realize that the subject is important to the filtering method of others. 

I am currently subscibed to eight lists. Now that you (Jason Tibbits)
mention it, I have seen this subject header thing before on non-interactive
lists such as the EFF list. This is nice in that it tells you the context
of the message though you already know it is EFF's newsletter. EFF can use
different 'automated' subject header prefixes as needed for different
context. In my case ALL EFF email goes in the same folder any way.

I guess that I only now found it annoying because this is the first
interactive list that I have seen this on. Interacitvity results in Re:
FVWM: yada yada. The primary complaint is just some strange quirk of my
brain saying, "That is just icky." KINDA THAT SAME WAY THAT ALL CAPS CHAFES
MOST EVERYONE. :)

Please understand that I did not intend to pitch a fit. I am just aprising
myself of the customs of this particular online community. Certainly, If
the community did request this than it must be good for the whole.

Sorry for the tussle,
Jason Wells

I just spent 15 minutes adding the ability determine if a window is
"WindowShaded" so I can do complex operations on it.  I see that this was
never added since ALL of the 32 bits of the window flags field are
allocated.  (Note, I stole bit 31, from the motif hacks which I dont use).
What do people think about bumping this to 64 bits?

Also, when this happens, the WindowShade stuff can be cleaned up a little.

Having been a X user at the local university I never knew how much actually
went into creating a _good_ interface. Now that I am writing my own
interface I see that there is much work to do to get it right.

Many interface options that can be set in X can also be set in fvwm2. I
will give an example for the sake of discussion. For example: the
sample.fvwm2rc file has an init function to perform a root window change.
This same behavior can be accomplished via .xsession.

I do foresee a couple issues. 

I use X at home, work, and school. I would like to design my interface so
that it is most portable between platforms. The problem is that fvwm is not
on all three locations. I use fvwm at home and would like my set up
elsewhere to be as similar as it can be to the home box.

The management of interface setting could easily become insane given the
possibilty of putting settings in any combination of different dot-files. I
have already tried to figured out why in the heck my xterm scrollbar as set
in .Xresources wasn't working anymore. (I got it figured out.) How does one
manage these settings in a sane manner?

Given the multiplicity of ways to create a certain interface, what other
issues are there that I might consider? Prior to installing FreeBSD at home
I never had to think much about interface.

Thanks,
Jason Wells

And then some.

The configuration of an X workstation is a problem that needs addressing.
I don't think things like CDE have really solved them.  Rather, some way
of managing it without depending on a limited-configure setup like CDE is
needed.

It is relatively easy to write a program to manage any one individual
file.  But across multiple files, most of which are totally different from
each other, it is much harder.

Still, I wish something like that existed... maybe something of a
theme-editor for X that understand the differenent files and how they
related.  I have seen anything written about this in any kind of serious
detail.

This is known as the GSFR (Great Style Flag Rewrite) and is the very
first and most important thing that is planned for the post-2.1 FVWM
version.  People have so many uses for this by now that 64 bits is
likely not enough; it'll have to be expandable (would anyway,
obviously).

Of course, the GSFR is really a legend and will never happen, because
FVWM 2.1 is a legend and will never happen (no offense to anyone in
particular, but it's been 2 years or more since I saw the first message
saying there was going to be one more "clean up" version, then 2.1; many
months, releases, and identical announcements later there seems to be
lots of enhancements but exactly 0 progress towards that goal.  Just my
perspective :).

It's not really that common.  Of all the (20+) mailing lists I have

You'll notice that all mail on this list has the following header:

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

If your MDA or MUA can't filter based on this header, you need to get
a new one :) Besides, with the Subject: solution, one could end up
getting an ``FVWM: why I hate this piece of crap'' from the FooBarWM
mailing list :)

Yes, it is the latter... And it is generally done as a courtesy to people
on ANY mailing list to allow them to use mailing filters to seperate their
mailboxes (i.e.. the fvwm list has "FVWM:", the fOX list uses "[fOX]", The
Turtle Beach Multisound list uses "[MS]" ... etc). It is usefull, trust me
;)

        Er...you haven't told it to wait for anything. Try adding the 
line

+         "I"    Wait X-ISP

before the line where you try to signal the process, and it should work
as you want. (Note that the window name is not quoted - quirky, I know,
but it doesn't work if you quote the name.) I just tried this on my
system, and it works fine. Of course, I had to shake off my usual 
lethargy and upgrade to the latest version of X-ISP to try this - 2.2 
didn't have this feature.  :-)

        By the way, if you have a working pidof command or the equivalent,
that's probably more reliable than looking at ~/.xisppid. A crashed process
could always leave a stale pid file lying around, and things like this also
tend to be release dependent.

        This seems to be a quirk in how ImageMagick attempts to figure 
out how it was started (though why it cares to know is beyond me). As 
such, its behavior is apt to differ slightly from system to system. 
Your first example doesn't work on my system -- but remove the '&' and
it does. The second one also works. However, it's not the kind of timing
problem that the original poster was experiencing.

        Works fine for me...assuming we're talking about the original
X-ISP problem, and not ImageMagick. See my reply to the original poster.

RedHat 5.0 (and possibly earlier versions, although I don't think it was in 
4.1) has wmconfig, which seems to be somewhat along those lines.  I haven't 
really tried it yet, but the documentation seems to suggest that you can write 
one file defining menus, icons and so on, and get it translated for a number 
of different window managers.  AnotherStep (another RedHat thing), apparently 
uses this, and lets users change between a couple of styles of desktop.

As I say, I don't know how much these do, but they're probably worth a look.  
Both are available in source from a suitable RedHat mirror (see 
<URL:http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html>).

I don't have problems with the quotes. Works fine.

I tried "Wait". This doesn't do what I want. Imagine this case: I start
xisp through the menu, it dials in. I minimize the window. I disconnect
vie SIGUSR2. Now I want to cennect again via the menu. A "Wait" will wait
for the minimized (or even a new?) window to (re)appear, wouldn't it?

I use this function which works reasonable well:

DestroyFunc  connect-xisp
AddToFunc       connect-xisp
+       "I"     None ["X-ISP"] exec xtoolwait -timeout 3 xisp\
                                 -bgcol '#0000b0'; kill -SIGUSR1\
                                   `cat /home/martinb/.xisppid`
+       "I"     Exec kill -SIGUSR1 `cat /home/martinb/.xisppid` 

Sometimes (after I restart fvwm, or if I invoke the function while I am
not at page 0,0) it will not work. Either xisp won't start altogether or
it won't dial in or it will start two times... "Interesting feature" as
the programmers say :-)

Where do I get such "pidof" utility from? I don't have one and it sounds
as is I really should have one :-)

Ciao,

BTW: If you use debian linux, you can get the new xisp package from
ftp://134.95.210.54/pub

The list maintainer has added this for those people who do not use
procmail or an equivalent program for automatically sorting mails
based on headers.  Said people can look at their inbox and see at a
glance which mails are from which mailing list and which mails are
private.

I do agree that using procmail or an equivalent would be a better
idea, though...

Well, welcome to the world of Unix: ``It must be a config file
somewhere, but *which* config file??''  :-|

The easiest thing would be to install fvwm at work (school?), too.
It's not difficult.  Just follow the instructions.  But do read them

Ouch! :)

I prefer the term 'semi-mythical' myself.

I have to admit that my progress with fvwm has been less than optimal
(as I warned it would be when I started) and I've been sorely tempted
lately to give up the care and feeding of fvwm to someone else because
of that.

[If those Lotto tickets would come through for me I'd have a lot more
free time to work on it! :)]

But for the time being at least I'll continue to plod along, as I'm
not quite ready to admit defeat.  I wish I could do something about
that stubborn streak. :)

[BUT, if anyone out there feels they'd like to try taking over
eventually, PLEASE let me know sometime in some private email]

So, a quick status and some theories:

  - Work on 2.0.47 is going ok (but slowly).  Quite a bit is going
    into it.  I hope to have it ready by the end of the year or
    shortly thereafter (I'll be taking vactaion the last two weeks of
    December and plan to finish it up during that if I haven't done so
    before then).

  - I hope that only one or two more 'betas' will be necessary after
    that before 2.1.0 can finially appear.  As I said, quite a bit is
    going into 2.0.47 and some bugs will have to be ironed out, but I
    think that it's finially getting close...  Hm...  Paul, does that
    sound familiar? :)

  - The GSFR is still planned for sometime after 2.1.0 is out.  I'll
    try and get a sketch of my ideas for it into the TO-DO list, in
    case anyone is interested or I'm forced to pass on the torch to
    someone else before I'm able to take a crack at it.  (I'd like to
    get some feedback on it if I do write something up)

Nope---this is only in RHL-5.0.  RHL-4.0 to 4.2 had the m4-based
configuration `TheNextLevel' for fvwm{2,95}, and earlier releases just
used fvwm-1.24r.

The fvwm2 is running on Ultra Sparc 1. I am suffering lack of color.
Is it possible to increase the max number of color in SUN machine.
How may I increase the color to 2^^16 instead of default 256?

Thank you in advance.

You need to buy hardware for this, I believe.  I'm not sure about the
Ultra Light, but for the SPARCstation 4 it was possible to buy
additional video memory for about $300.  Assuming that an Ultra is not
worse than an SS4, this should be possible for the Ultra, as well.
You might want to contact your local Sun dealer.

NB: The Ultra 1/170E has got a Creator graphics card which groks true
color.  Maybe you can buy such a card for your Ultra?

I notice that no one (including, I'm first to admit, me) is jumping up

A comment: in my experience this is extremely common with free software,
and one of the major issues to be addressed for any free software
development process.  I've seen it with perl, Linux, fvwm, gcc, etc.

People just keep adding features, and more features, and more and more
features, and a "stable" release never comes out because with every
release that fixes bugs in the last set of features there are more
features to be debugged.

And it only gets worse the more time that elapses between some kind of
reference release, because people get worried that the _next_ "stable"
release will take as long as the last one, and they're all pushing to
get their favourite item into _this_ one so they don't have to wait a
few years for the next one, and then this one takes longer, etc. etc.

A vicious catch-22 :)

My opinion, FWIW, is that no more new features should be accepted,
period (okay, maybe the autoconf stuff can go in! :).  Make one release
with not a single new feature, but just whatever bug fixes there are,
then cut 2.1 if that looks reasonable after 3 weeks or so (give a hard
deadline to prod people into getting/installing the latest version).

The only way to get out of this is for someone to be hard-hearted and
say "forget it; you have to wait."  Not that these aren't the world's
greatest features, but a line has to be drawn, and kept.

Note this _only_ works if we can commit to getting the release _done_
within a month or so of the feature freeze.  Otherwise things will back
up too much and the dam will break again.

Yep :)

As I said above, IMO we will never be able to stop the "one or two more
betas" until we stop the "just a few more features".

Hello fvwmers,

I am using "ButtonStyle n Vector" to draw my title-bar buttons.

My problem is that when I'm trying to minimize the space of the title bars
using:

Style "flatness"    UseDecor flatness,Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4
Style "*"           UseStyle flatness

AddToDecor flatness
+ TitleStyle -- flat
+ BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
+ HilightColor Gold PaleTurquoise4


I am loosing the structure I draw on the title-bar buttons.

I tried to draw that same using 10x10 pallet (instead of 100x100) with no luck.


Any way to enjoy both short borders and my own customized title-bar buttons?

Thanks in advance,
Yehuda.

        Ok, I'm a little dense. Now I see what the problem is - I thought
it was just the timing between starting X-IXP and trying to send it a signal.
Handling the case where X-IXP is already active is a job for a shell script,
really. But it's not a very complicated one - check to see if the xisp 
process is active, exec xisp if it isn't and do a check-process/sleep
loop until it looks active, then send the signal. A lot can be done with
FVWM functions, but fvwm is a window manager, not a full-fledged 
programming language - nor was it meant to be. For that, you'd need some-
thing like GWM.  :-)

        Alternatively, two menu items and functions could be used - one for
when X-ISP is active, one for when it's not.

        It's part of the sysvinit package for Linux systems. (pidof is
actually a symlink to killall5, in the /sbin directory.) If you're using 
Debian Linux, I would think it would be installed as part of the base system.
But this is straying a bit off the subject of FVWM.... If we continue in
this vein, we should probably take it off-line from the mailing list.

        Cheers,

Well, fvwm2 can handle this really good. No problems so far :-)

+ "disconnect" exec kill -SIGUSR2 `/sbin/pidof xisp`

Yes, it is. I tried a "which pidof" as joe user, so I didn't find it in
/sbin/ . I think I better use "locate whatever|grep bin/" next time.

Maybe I'm confused.  There are  flags in the WindowList structure, and
flags  in the   name_list (Style flags)  structure.   The   bits serve
different purposes in each.  In both cases, it looks like all the bits
are used up.  I thought the term GSFR applied to the Style Flags.

In  the case of  the WindowList,  I don't see   any obstacle to adding
another unsigned long (flags2?) to hold additional bits.

On the separate subject of the style flags, after the iconboxes patch,
I don't see   any obstacle to  doing  the  same  thing for new   style
bitfields.

Please correct me if I'm missing something.

I think it does, although any flags field where all the bits are used up
is a potential problem.

The problem is, as you say, all the bits are used up.  There are many
ways to solve the problem, of course.  One way is this, keep adding new
ulongs with new names.  That's probably the most trivial way to fix it.

I don't like this (although I don't hack fvwm so I don't really have any
say :); now when you want to test a flag you have to remember and put in
the code which "flags" param it is: flags, flags2, flags3, etc.  It's
just kind of gross.

I'd prefer changing the type of the flags field from ulong to an array
of unsigned char, something like this:

  #include <limits.h>

  #ifndef CHAR_BIT
  #define CHAR_BIT 8    /* ISO C should #define this for us in limits.h */
  #endif

    ...

  #define MAX_STYLE_FLAGS   54  /* Increment for new flags */

  #define STYLE_FLAG_SIZE   ((MAX_FLAGS/CHAR_BIT)+1)

  ...
    unsigned char on_flags[STYLE_FLAG_SIZE];
  ...

then provide a set of functions or macros for testing and setting bits
and hiding this structure.

Since this touches all code that currently looks at these bits, it was
decided it's too big a change to make before 2.1.  Of course, that was
when we thought 2.1 would be out in the summer of 1996 or so ;) :)

	Fvwmconf is an graphical interface to configure the fvwm2 window
manager. It reflects changes immediately .  Colors, fonts, images , etc.
are selected via tools by pointing and clicking.  When the windows look
OK, you click save. 

	Fvwmconf is written in perl/Tk .

	It has run successfully on linux and sparc boxes. (others ?) 

	See the page 

http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~lapeyre/fvwmconf/

	for details.  It is available on  some European sites and is on
sunsite and mirrors.
	If you have trouble finding a fast link, mail me.


	See the changelog on the web page if you have an older version. 
It is the only source for determining which new features are available.
(Except for downloading and reading the help) 

	This is a good time to announce, as development will slow for a
while except for bugs that may crop up.  (Unless someone else gets
involved !) 

	I really don't know if the release is alpha or omega.  From my
site there have been 1100 downloads of the code.  All of the reported
installation bugs have been removed.  The number 0.18 was chosen because
it is the 18th public release.

        Yes, this is a major stumbling block for development that goes far
beyond the Style problem, though that's what seems to get the most 
attention. The reason the poor old flag word in the FvwmWindow struct is
so overloaded is that it's being used for two unrelated things: window
*style*, and window *state*, which is even more important to the 
functioning of a window manager (even though that's not where the 
sex-appeal is at). I think the two really ought to be divorced from one 
another somehow. And a style flag struct of some sort that's common to
both the style (but not specific window) related code and the window
related code would be really nice.

        Whatever is decided for the style flags, the same treatment should
probably be accorded the state-related flags - whether it's a bit-field 
struct or some other solution. And whatever is done will affect every bit 
of code, style-related or not, that ever looks at SomeOldWin->flags. Lotta
grunt work to be done there. 'Tain't glamorous, but I'll happily volunteer
to do some of it, whenever the design's finalized.

        I still tend to favor the bit-field approach, but more on that in
another note.

Hi!

Sorry to send this off-topic query in this mailing list.

Are dynamically linked libraries used at the time of 
starting of executible only or for the full duration
the executible runs? If I replace or remove a dynamically 
linked lib during the execution, what happens? If a function
call refers to dynamically links lib, old lib(might be in mem)
or new lib is refered or the program crashes. Is the
behaviour depend on os (Unix, Win95 ..).

If U know the proper mailing list for this kind of queries,
please tell me.

Thanx!!

I agree.  If you want to start on something there is something that CDE has that 
I miss in FVWM.  It's the ability to set a desk occupation list on a window.  
With FVWM a window can be in one desk or all(sticky).  I'd like to be able to 
have a window belong to desks 1,2 and not 3,4 and have sticky mean stick to the 
glass in the desks that the window belongs to.  Obviously this would mean making 
the window state flags dynamically sizeable or fixing the maximum number of 
desks so it might be tough.  I'll volunteer to test it.

Cheers,
Tim

Howdy all.

Just wanted to send a quick note saying that my mail died for a few
hours yesterday, and I lost a lot of the very good discussion (and
emotional feud) that was generated.  But, as the subject says,
thankfully the mailing lists are archvied, so I'm catching up on
everything that I missed...

A few notes on things I've seen so far:

        - I had also coded up a bitfield vs bitmasks test like Dan
          did, and under AIX (have to try Linux still) running like
          100,000,000 sets & clears, the times it took for each (under
          both xlc and gcc) were VERY similar.  Didn't compare the
          generated assembler though, I'll have to do that.  But since
          the times are so similar, I doubt a performance hit will
          actually be noticed.  The times, in case anyone is
          interested:

       AIX xlc -g:          23 seconds for both
               -O2:         3 seconds for bitfield, 0 for bitwise &/|
       AIX gcc 2.7.2.1 -g:  29 for bitfield, 27 for bitwise
                       -O2: 6 seconds for both

          Still need to do some more testing though.

        - I like all of the feedback I saw.  Thanks!  Still reading it
          all...

I'll try and make more responses to mail I missed as I can.  If anyone
sent anything to me directly and didn't copy the list, you may want to
resend it...

Thanks,
Chuck

Hi,

It is not possible for FvwmAuto to auto-raise the FvwmPager, because
the pager is never given input focus.  The patch below fixes this bug.
I needed it for the perl module I wrote for raising specific windows
to work for the one window I most wanted auto-raised.

I submitted another patch a couple weeks ago - should I expect a
confirmation on whether these will actually get incorporated?  

thanks,
Greg

Hi,

If you don't sort the IconMan buttons, the order ends up changing as
you switch back and forth between different desks, and this is highly
irritating.  This is presumably because the module gets the window
messages from fvwm in different orders.  This patch adds a new option,
sortbyappid of type boolean which changes the sort to sort by the
application id, roughly equivalent to order of window creation as twm
does, rather than by the button name.

Eg, you might use

*FvwmIconMan*sortbyappid     true

to set this behavior.  It is false by default.

Patch follows.

Greg

Don't want to sound silly or something, but why not just

Hi all,

   I don't know if this is possible or not.. the man page for fvwm seems
   to indicate to me that it is ... but I am not able to understand how
   to make it work :)

   What I am trying to do is define a "style" for inactive windows and
   a different "style" for active windows.

   Say:  Inactive windows I want:

            Title + Borders   =   red
            Title text        =   black
            Not Handles
            Flat

         Active window I want:

            Title + Borders   =   blue
            Title text        =   white
            With Handles
            Flat


   Is this possible with fvwm-2.0.45?  If so can someone point me to
   some documentation please or a simple example?  As I said I am not
   able to follow the man page.  :-(

   Thanks in advance.

Cool. I'll put it in before my next release.

I am painfully certain that this boils down to a RTFM problem, but I have and I 
still can't get it to work so here it is...


I can't get the iconbox to work.  I can get the iconbox to come up, but when I m
inimize things, they don't go there.  I can't figure out what the problem is.  I
 would really appreciate any help.

You can see my current config at http://jbrown.fastrans.net/jbrown/desktop.html

Note that I do not have the iconbox configure to come up by itself in that confi
g (because I can't get it to work properly ;)

Thanks!

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7


  Hi.  I know this basically falls under the FAQ of "I would like
really cool feature 'X'", but in this case it is a fairly small
extention of existing capabilities, and it's very useful to me in at
least one case.  I assume it might be useful enough to others to
justify the cost of adding it (which shouldn't be great, I don't
think).  I wanted to discuss with people more familiar with the design
and current workings of fvwm the idea, tho, and see what everyone
thinks...

  The behaviour I want is the behaviour I put into tvtwm into a
function called "RelativeMove".  You give it a geometry spec, and it
will operate on the current window.  (Or you could select one, if you
invoked it somewhere where that would be necessary).  But anyway, I
bind it to a set of keys, so that "Shift-Left", for example, in a
window context will move that window by the specified amount.  (I
defined Shift-Left to be +1+0, but it could be anything)  Obviously, I
also defined the rest of the arrow keys, at a variety of distances per
move with various modifiers.

  I find this very useful for doing precise positioning of a window,
and for the times that do seem to exist where I want to move a window
a few (20-40) pixels out of the way, but don't want to have to go all
the way to the mouse, then find a titlebar/frame/etc, then move it;
all just for 20 pixels so I can read something in another window for a
moment.

  Having explained what I want and why, now I wanted to mention what I
think might be an acceptable, and "least-intrusive" method to do the
same in fvwm (2.0.42 is where I am now).  I think if the behaviour of
GetTwoArguments (in misc.c) was extended to handle a 'r' (or 'R')
qualifier, in addition to the already special 'p' qualifier, that it
would indicate to the caller somehow that it was to be relative.  This
seems gentler than making a new function to do a RelativeMove, and
there are other cases (RelativeResize) where one might want something
similar.  

  To get this information back to GetTwoArgument's caller, we'd either
have to pass in more arguments, or change the way the val1_unit
argument is dealt with.  Not just use it as a divisor all the time,
like it is now.  This is the short-term solution I took to make it
work for Move for me right now.  But, I didn't modify the behaviour of
the other things that call GetTwoArguments, and that would definately
have to be done so they wouldn't choke on an odd value of
val1_unit/val2_unit being returned.

  I'd be happy to hear anyone else's opinions on this, and any
suggestions you have.  I'd be happy to implement whatever we decide on
if anyone would like me to.

  (and yes, I did subscribe to this list before posting this; so I
could hear discussions about current developments...)

                               - Chris

Hi,

I found and installed the CDE look-a-like of Fvwm, called FvwmCDE, back
in April, and did actually like it. However, now that I am looking for
updates it seems to have vaporized :-( (the servers that used to host it
apparently does not exist anymore, and searchengines like Lycos doesn't
seem to be of much help).

Does anyone know if and where I can find it ?

Thanks
Rasmus

   -snip-

Here's an example of what I have for my active and inactive windows:

# This handles active and inactive titlebars
TitleStyle ActiveUp (TiledPixmap titlebar.xpm) Inactive (TiledPixmap titlebar2.xpm)
# This handles active and inactive borders
BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap titlebar.xpm
BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap titlebar2.xpm

You can,of course,modify this as per the man page as this is a basic
implementation. Hope it helps :)

Hello,

The users that i have set up on my system arent able to run X anymore.
When i first added the users, X worked fine as i had it set up to
automatically run startx after login. Now i get the following lines in
the output of startx :

	PEX extension module not loaded
	XIE extension module not loaded
	rm: /tmp/fvwmrca00274: Operation not permitted
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	xinit:  connection to X server lost.

	waiting for X server to shut down 

this line underlined is the difference, and i dont know why all of a
sudden this is occuring. Root operates fine.

Thanks

Not that this is fvwm related (IMO) but it seems to be a possible
permissions problem with /tmp dir. Check the perms on /tmp and try
deleting /tmp/fvwmrca00274 as well.

Hi,

    Does FVWM or X11R6 have the ability to display a backgroup
wallpaper.  If so, how is it done?  If not I would be interested in
doing it.  How difficult do you think it will be?  Where in the source
code would I start? I do ALOT of coding in UNIX using C, but I don't
have much exposure to the X Windows coding environment.

Thanks,

Craig Hutchison

Hi there,

   I'd suggest you take a look at 'man xsetroot' and also play
   with xv to tile images to the background (see 'man xv').

   Hope this helps,

Patrick ...

Fvwm itsself doesn't do wall paper.  The background of the root window can be
set by any program.  One might use xsetroot to get solid color or stipple
patterns.  For a more textured background xpmroot (which comes with fvwm) will
let you load in an xpm file as a background.  If you want to load in a jpg or
gif or something, try xv.  xv -root -quit foo.jpg will load the picture into
the root window, then have xv exit.  xpmroot is faster than xv, but can only
load xpm files.

    I'm having a problem compiling fvwm 2.0.46 on Unixware 2.1.2 using

problem with /usr/include/sys/byteorder_f.h. So I've decided to take my
chances with cc.

Hi

I dunno if anyone has observed this before, and at home I'm currently
unable to glimpse my mailarchive, but FvwmIconMan 1.0 (Included in
Fvwm 2.0.46) cannot handle fonts with a space in the name (for
instance it cannot use 'new century schoolbook' as its font.

I guess (no time to look at the code) that a strchr is done on the
wrong parameters.

So long
EJ

        A LOW PRICE without quality doesn't mean much!!! Does it? That's
why we design and manufacture our computers to LAST well into the
next century. We don't skimp on anything. We build our Computers for
you CAREFULLY, one at a time (a far cry from the assembly line mentality 
of: slap it together and hope it works). We TEST each and every computer
for at least 72 hours, so they work FLAWLESSLY right out of the box.

        No large company can afford to do that. Nor are they willing to!
Consider a reader's survey by PC World Magazine in the June '97 issue. 
They found MORE THAN HALF of their readers experienced PROBLEMS with 
BRAND NAME computers they recently bought. They titled the article, 
"When Bad PCs Happen to Good People." The conclusion is obvious: dealing 
with a large company doesn't assure you of getting a dependable computer.

        You are not just a number to us. The technician who builds your
computer, custom configures it exactly how you want it - just right for
you. He even knows your name since it gets programmed into the computer
when he optimizes it for speed and performance. And you'll know his name
too, because he signs his name to your computer. This guarantees it has
been built to the best of his ability and ready for your computing
pleasure. There is nothing for you to do except plug it in and turn it
on. That's all!  Remember, our computers work FLAWLESSLY right out of the box.

P.S. SPECIAL BONUS IF YOU ORDER NOW! BRAND NEW 15" MONITOR FOR ONLY $197         OR A 17" MONITER FOR ONLY $397, your choice with the purchase of any Computer. 

          We selected these amazingly sharp and clear .28 SVGA monitors as the perfect 
         match for your new Computer. They have a full three year warranty.

You have to use 

Style "*" NoIcon

And 

*FvwmIconBox "XTerm"            NeXTterm.xpm
*FvwmIconBox "Emacs"		gnu.xpm
 [ and so on ]

If you do it like this it works. I know FvwmIconBox is supposed to
extract the Icon files from the Style commands as well, but for some
insane reason that doesn't work. If I have some time left during the
holidays, I'll take a peek at the code...

So long
EJ

The latest (and probably last) version of FvwmCDE, v.1.5, can be found
at

http://www.dilnet.upd.edu.ph/~orly/unixcentral/FvwmCDE.html

I think no further development from the original author can be expected.

The module is highly usable in its present status, though.

Lots o' things have problems counting pixels.  Usually they are off by
one, but some things up to three.

I cannot place an icon on the right edge of the screen (but the left
is ok).  Not even by "physically" moving it with the mouse.  There
will always be an extra 1-pixel gap.  If the icon is placed with Style
"*" IconBox, the gap increases to 2 pixels.  The respective numbers
for the bottom edge are 2 and 3.

BTW, it would also be nice for the IconBox style to have a packing
direction parameter: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or
bottom-right.  (Yes I know I can start yet another process [or two] to
do this better, but I'd prefer not to).

I don't know what goes on with HP-VUE, but _it_ puts some kind of
wallpaper up which apparently distinct from the X server's background.  At
least it appears so to me, the simple user.  If I put up an xsetroot or
xpmroot or xview -root <stuff> background and invoke Vue, it covers the
background with whatever it wants (unless it is told to use no backdrop). 
When the user exits Vue, the old background is exposed again.  How it does
this, I don't know.  But I do know that with a Vue-specified background,
invoking xsetroot and cousins will not overwrite it.  If you want to do
the xearth thing, for instance, you must select a blank Vue background or
you simply won't ever see xearth.  I found these things empirically and
never have understood what Vue does.  Is it possible that Mr. Hutchison is
speaking of this kind of feature?

I also believe that FvwmBacker serves this purpose, and has not yet been
mentioned in the several replies I have seen.

It (the Vue window manager) does this so that you can drag and drop 
files/programs/etc. on to what looks like the root window.  If you select no 
backdrop you can't drop files on to the root window.  Bit of a hack IMHO.

Cheers,
Tim.

Chris,

This is how I'm doing it with the current code base of FVWM (great WM).

 10:25 vanzant:> fvwm2 -version
[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.0.46 compiled on Nov  3 1997 at 14:37:44


# First bind Meta-Ctrl-m to Move
Key m       A   CM  Move

Now, pressing the arrow keys will move the window 10 pixels (I think) and
pressing Meta-Ctrl-Arrow will move it in one pixel at a time.

I hope this is what you are looking for,
Yehuda.

  That will (or at least, should) work, and was something I hadn't
thought of.  But, I think it will be a little unwieldy to use.  It'll
require the extra keystroke to get into move mode, then keystrokes to
move it around, then something to get out of move mode.  (How do you
get out of move mode?)

  I think it would be a small effort to just make the positioning
parameters to Move/Resize/etc take arguments to make them relative...

Dear Future Executive: 


2Hour Resume/Cover Letter Package
_______________________________________________________________________
Please pardon us if this important message doesn't concern you.

INTRODUCTION
The Resume Doctor has created generic resumes and cover letters for both
the general public and college graduates. All you do is modify them 
(delete the text which is there) with the inclusion of your information. 
There is no need to format anything. It's already done for you. We save you
time even if you're an expert with word processors. Using this package is
easier than using a resume program or having your resume or cover letter 
prepared by a resume specialist whom you don't know. The Resume Doctor has
examined both options and find them too costly and cumbersome. You could
have a superb looking resume in less than two hours with our resume package. 
In fact, we guarantee it. We'll finish it for you if you are unable to. 
(please read below).
 
The Resume Doctor treats every customer as if they would a member of thier
family. In order to continue to provide superior service to our clients, 
we are offering this package for a limited time only. If you're serious about 
looking for work, we're serious about helping you. So order today before 
we sell out. The Resume Doctor has been preparing resumes since 1988 and 
we know what works.

Our complete package, detailed below, may either be mailed to you on a
diskette or attached as an E-mail download. In both cases, you will simply 
save the files as a document (doc ext.) or a rich-text (rtf ext). Please
indicate on the order form below which method you require.




                                 THE PACKAGE

There's simply nothing that compares to what you get with our resume package. 
A complete package like ours could easily retail for more than $75.00. 
Your cost is just $29.95.


PREFORMATTED RESUMES  
You will receive a variety of resume templates. All of the templates are 
formatted differently. Just choose the one best suited for you. We also 
include the most common formatting instructions in case you get lost. 
Everything you need will be at your finger tips for fast and easy 
processing. 


TOP COVER LETTERS
Our cover letters are the best. "You have to see to believe". Our cover 
letters are written for cold-calls, replies to classified advertisements,
and self-promotion. The cover letters are motivational in style. There's a 
chock-full of paragraph options to choose from.  We think that our cover 
letters alone will get you in the door. 
Attn: Graduating students - "Our cover letters will level the playing field
for you." (if you're writing your own cover letters, our cover letters will
           serve as a perfect demonstration on how they should be written.)

60 SECRET WORDS/PHRASES
Similar to internet search engines, more and more businesses are using 
scanners that search for certain words/phrases in resumes. We'll provide you
with the top 60 words/phrases and tell you where to put them. This is vital
if you're applying at large companies.

LIST OF FIELD HEADERS
You get field headers too. Some of the most common headers in resumes are 
Objective, Summary, and Experience. You'll get a comprehensive list from us
with your package.

OVER 120 ACTION WORDS
Words such as collaborated, systemized, rehabilitated, and inspired are 
examples of action word. Action words help get your message across. The 
Resume Doctor has more than 120 of them to give you.

FAQ 
Want answers to our most common questions such as do you include salary
history in a resume or cover letter or does a resume have to be just one
page?
Answers to those questions are included in our package.

INTERVIEW TIPS
We have the best. Don't even think about going on an interview without them. 
They're that good!

CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND GUARANTEE
As indicated above, The Resume Doctor will finish-up your resume for you if
you're not able to do it within two hours. We also anticipate reviewing your
completed resume and cover letters. Just E-mail them back to us. We are
responsible. You get interviews or a refund. It's that simple! All
information provided to The Resume Doctor is kept completely confidential.
Please contact us at 818-710-6474 and we'll be happy to answer any question
you may have regarding our service.

CAREER HELP
Now that you have a great looking resume and cover letter, you'll want to do 
something with them. Our package presents you with the very best career links
on the internet. 

RESUME POSTING FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES
We've included in the package top web sites for posting your resume. You 
could cut and paste them into a bulletin board in about five minutes.
(We will have a list of sites for the general public soon) 


AS WE TOLD YOU, YOU CAN'T BUY A MORE COMPLETE RESUME PACKAGE LIKE THIS 
ANYWHERE. ALSO, WE'LL FINISH IT FOR YOU IF YOUR UNABLE TO DO IT WITHIN TWO
HOURS.

I am not sure how this happened: I "lost" some colors, very basic ones,
like "red", "green".  Everytime I tried to use it as the background or
foreground color, I got a message saying colormap cannot allocate.
However, the color name is defined in the rgb.txt, and even more
strange, if I use CDE (Common Desktop Enviornment), there seems to be no
problem at all.  I used to think it was a X client setup problem, but
now I wonder if it has anything to do with Window Manager.  Can any one
tell me what the problem is?  Thanks!

You've probably run out of colours.  Some workstations, including many from 
Sun, often come with video cards only capable of 8-bit colour (256 colours).  
It's a window manager issue only in that different managers may use up 
different numbers of colours for their own uses (window decorations, and 
especially colourful icons and backgrounds).  This is not related to what's in 
rgb.txt (which just gives symbolic names to colours).

Hi,

Please forgive me for the whimpy question, but I have not had any success
in finding an answer.

We have just started using you first Sun that is running (I believe)
Solaris 2.  All our other Sun's are SunOS 4.xxx.  Currently the compiling
environment on the Solaris machine leaves alot to be desired (virtually
non-existant for now).

Therefore I am trying to locate fvwm binaries for this machine rather then
attempting to compile the source.  The rest of our machines are running
1.24r (I know, I know) so that is the perfered version.  BUT, then again
this could be the excuse I have been looking for to push everyone to 2.x :)

If you know where I can get the binaries, or what more information I need
to get them... I would appreciate your response.

Thanks.
Merlin.

Merlin,

Did you try to use the SunOS binaries on the Solaris machine?

Should work. Did for me. I used the old binaries months on a Solaris
box before I found time to compile it on Solaris. I must say thought that
I had no problem compiling the software both on SunOS and on Solaris.

Good luck,
Yehuda.

Greetings FVWMers,

I am asking for some help here so please bear with me.

I am trying to manage my icons on my workstation a little bit better.
I am using FVWM version 2.0.46 on a RS/6000 running AIX 4.1.

Currently the way I handle my Icons is by using the following command
in my .fvwmrc:

Style *         IconBox -15 500 -1 -1


This command puts all the icons on my page on the left hand side about
half way down the screen.  Each icon is then added down the page.
Once it reaches the bottom of the page, it starts putting them
somewhere on the top of the page. This probably is not the best way to
handle icons.

I would like to be able to manage the icons a little bit better.  Here
is my wish list of the things I would like to be able to do:

1) Have mini icons next to the icon title without the large icons
displayed.  It would like to save space and use mini icons instead of
the large icons.

2) Be able to distinguish between applications and have a different
location for icons based on these applications.  For example, one
column for xterms, one column for emacs, and one column for the rest.

I already have different decors set up for this, so the icon title
colors are already different.

2)  Be able to have the icons added from the bottom and go up. 


I may be asking for a lot.  I tried to use IconMan to accomplish this
(Thanks to Ric Lister), but had several problems.  IconMan started
well, but when I clicked on the icons, all the icons disappeared, as
if IconMan crashed or something.  Here is a snip of my .fvwmrc that
sets up IconMan:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3 managers: 1 = all, 2 = xterms, 3 = emacs
*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 3

*FvwmIconMan*3*iconname   "FvwmIconMan: Emacs"
*FvwmIconMan*3*background GoldenRod
*FvwmIconMan*3*foreground Black
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


So I guess I don't know what I am doing.

If anyone can help me, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks

As I recall you can define more than one IconBox...try that. As for the

Hello again.

I have isolated my problem and I have figured out a couple of things
but I am confused on a couple of issues.  Maybe some of you could
help.

As I said before, I am using IconMan with FVWM version 2.0.46 on a
RS/6000 with AIX 4.1.

I found out the reason IconMan was crashing.  For some reason when I
use the command:

*FvwmIconMan*drawicons True

IconMan crashes when I de-iconify anything.

This may be attributed to the other problems I am seeing.  The
commands:

*FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry 140x20

and 

*FvwmIconMan*managergeometry 10x1-100-1


Simply do not do anything.  I can make the values anything and IconMan
still runs with default sizes and geometries.

Maybe the MiniIcons can't fit in the default button geometry so it
crashes.  I don't know.

Does anyone out there have this same problem or know some idea why
this is happening to me?  

Thanks in advance for any help.

are errors telling me that I don't have my fonts configured???...When
using, for example arena, it opens, but imediately disapears. What is
the cause of this problem?

I  don't think   your  problem is  caused  by  fvwm.  Fvwm  doesn't do
anything to interfere with your ability to use fonts.

You can look at  the directories that  your X server  is using  to get
fonts from by issuing the command "xset -q".

Part of the output will look like this:

  Font Path:
    /opt/public/pkg/x32/fonts,/u/dane/fonts/fonts,
  /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Xt+/

If you need to add fonts to your fontpath, use "xset +fp".

Hello.  I remember reading that FVWM might be ported for use w/ gnu
autoconfig.  I have successfully compiled many apps with this utility, and I
have been unable to get IMAKE to work with fvwm.  So my question is this, 'is
it being ported to autoconfig, and if so, is there an ETA on it's release?'
If it's in the near future, I'll just wait, if not, I'll have to start
tinkering w/ IMAKE....

Thanx in advance,
 Brian

I seem to be having trouble getting the 'Current' built-in to do
what I think it ought to do.  Can anyone help clear up my confusion?

I'm attempting to create a function 'PopupAppMenu' which will pop up
a certain menu based on what window it is invoked from.  My function 
looks like:

DestroyFunc PopupAppMenu
AddtoFunc   PopupAppMenu \
  "I" Current [app1] Popup App1Menu
+ "I" Current [app2] Popup App2Menu
+ "I" Current [app3] Popup App3Menu

and is bound into the titlebar of all aplicable windows, i.e.:


Style "*"    NoButton 5
Style "app1" Button5
Style "app2" Button5
Style "app3" Button5

Mouse 0		5	A	Function PopupAppMenu

The various App?Menu definitions exist are are correct (I can pop them up
by binding them directly to a key or mouse button).

Now, the way I understand it, the appropriate App?Menu should be popped 
up when button 5 is pressed in the respective window.  But when put to the
test, nothing happens (the button relief reverses to indicate that it's been
pressed, but no popup appears).  So can anyone tell me: is fvwm doing the
wrong thing, or am I assuming the wrong thing?  I've glanced at the code for
CurrentFunc() and Circulate(), but am none the wiser.  Any suggestions
on how to accomplish this would be most appreciated.

This is with fvwm 2.0.46 running on HP-UX 10.01.

The patches are there and they work.  This has been discussed recently on
fvwm-workers, and a link to the patches is on the FVWM web page.

Seems correct to me.

> Style "app3" Button5

Perhaps you should put a space between Button and 5.
It's the only possible error I can think of.

What does fvwm say when you try this ?
You get an error message ?
Do you keep a .fvwm2.log file ?

Yes, I'm working on autoconf for fvwm.  There are patches, as previously
posted, but they should be considered ALPHA quality.  I'm working on them
right now, so they will be volatile for the next day or so.  After that,
I'm on holiday for a bit.

If you want to download them and test, I'd greatly appreciate all bug
reports as well as success stories.  But, please hold off until after
Christmas day before downloading the patches.

I hope to finish the work in early January.

I've tried it with and without the space.  The button got mapped
either way, but I didn't get my popup when it was pressed.

I hadn't been keeping a log file, but on your advice I now do.
The only suspicious thing that showed up were some ButtonStyle
errors on an unrelated button.  When I cleared up those, Current
started behaving as I expected (!).  I'm still not sure I understand
what was causing the odd behavior, but I've got my popups working the
way I want them and I guess that's good enough for me.  Thanks for
your help!

How do you get fvwm to generate a log file?

Well, it probably depends on how you're running fvwm.  I use:

     exec /home/hart/fvwm2/fvwm2 > ${HOME}/logs/fvwm.log 2>&1

as the last line of my .xsession file.  If you like lots of
output and really slow performance, you can also throw -debug 
in there as well.  YMMV.

Okay, this may have been covered before in here, but I didn't see it
anywhere in the FAQ, and I'm having trouble getting it to work. So,
sorry if I'm rehashing old topics...

Basically, I'd like to configure fvwm (I'm running 2.0.46) so I can use
the keyboard to do almost everything.  I have most of it configured except
the following things.

1. The ability to alternate/cycle through open windows (similar to alt-tab 
in MS Windows).
2. Keyboard control to maximize/return to normal a xterm
3. Keyboard control to resize an xterm
4. Something to simulate a mouse click/double click.

If anyone could provide me with hints/tips/advice/examples as to get 
this work, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

I'm running FVWM at home under a Slackware 2.0.30 installation, but I'm =

but Doslinux doesn't include a compiler (which is what I think the =

Is there a binary distribution available for FVWM that'll install into =
Doslinux without the need to compile, or could someone guide me through =
whatever's needed to get the basic FVWM package installed?  I know this =
may be a bit of a large undertaking, but I thought I'd ask since I've =

Thanks in advance and happy holidays!

As a former fvwm95 user, I have been running the taskbar under fvwm2
for about a month now.  This morning I finally decided that those
annoying little grey squares in place of MiniIcons were just too much,
and went looking through the FvwmTaskBar code to find the problem.
After a few minutes of comparing things with FvwmIconMan, I found the
problem.

Following is a patch to get FvwmTaskBar (as distributed with fvwm
2.0.46, under extras/) to do MiniIcons correctly.  This may not apply
cleanly (I played around with the file a bit before copying off the
.orig), but you get the general idea:

AddToFunc "FocusRaise"		"I" Focus
+				"I" Raise

Key Tab         A       M       Next FocusRaise
Key Tab         A       MS      Prev FocusRaise
Key Tab		A	C	Next [CurrentDesk] FocusRaise
Key Tab		A	CS	Prev [CurrentDesk] FocusRaise

Alt-Tab and Alt-Shift-Tab cycle through the windows, in opposite
orders.  Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab cycle through those on the
current desktop.

BTW, is there a particular reason there is no !CurrentDesk condition?

You may want different numbers for Maximize, depending on your screen
layout.  To resize, hit Alt-F6, move around with the arrow keys, and
hit enter to accept (or escape to cancel).  To maximize/unmaximize,
Alt-F7.


> 4. Something to simulate a mouse click/double click.

That's a bit more difficult.  If I remember correctly, there was a
discussion about this on this list a few weeks ago.  Basically, you
can generate fake mouse events, but most programs won't accept them.
You can possibly do something with XIE (X Input Extensions), but that
would probably not be too fun, and bugger if I know how to.

Moore's patch does indeed work (thanks).  The two character change
transformed taskbar mini-icons from a grey area and a bunch of error
msgs to little pictures.  I applied the patch manually but it does
look like he has the linenumbers set up for a clean patch.  I hope
this makes it into .47.  Here is my diff (Emacs vc-diff C-x v =).

Hi,

i have patched fvwm 2.0.45 with the animated-move (gjb) patch and
(by hand) with the animated-shade patch.
now i have animated menus + animated windows :)
you can get the binary (maybe first in 1-2 days) from:
http://www.rat.de/Adam/software/fvwm2-kLo.tgz (82kb)

this don't work with fvwm 2.0.46 because the animated-move (gjb) patch
(300KB!) don't like fvwm 2.0.46 and i don't have the mind to patch by
hand.. with the animated-shade (8kb patch) this is easilier.. :)

This patch (any many others) is included with the fvwm-2.0.46 sources
distributed with Red Hat 5.0

I have 2 questions

1. How do I get FvwmPagerMiniIcons to work with .fvwm2rc95?

2. How do I get 9 work areas in a desktop? I have 3 desktops
with 4 work areas in each. I am not able to create more work
areas.

Thanks in advance.

I have created a few extra button bars - giving them names other than
FvwmButtons.  They work fine, and do exactly what I want.  However, I want
to be able to remove them with a single mouse click.

I tried defining a button to, for example,    KillModule FvwmApps.   But it
didn't work.   KillModule FvwmButtons   did the trick, but it killed all
of the button bars, not just the one I want.

Is there a way to do what I want, or am I asking too much?

Brian.

I finally decided to compile and install version 2.0.46, after many
months with .45...
All's well, except for a little glitch: Focus doesn't seem to also raise
a window, as it should.
I've always got the Alt-tab key combination binded to a Prev Focus
command.  
It has always worked as expected in fvwm 2.0.45, but as I installed
version .46 typing the combination now only switches focus, without
rising the focused window.
The manual page says that Focus "Raises the window if needed to make it
visible."  Indeed it worked that way with the previous version.
Now I had to write a small function to explicitly Focus and Raise a
window.  Is it a known problem or did I miss something?

				Ciao

You missed something:

       37. Focus command no longer raises - use an interpreted
           focus-and-raise function if that's desired

But the man page still says "Raises the window if needed to make it visible", 
so that needs changing.

Hi, 

I recently installed and began using fvwm2. One feature that I don't like 
is being bound to one back and one fore color for all menus. Is the 
capability to specify a different back and fore color for each menu on 
the drawing boards? How difficult would it be to implement? 

Thanks,

I think it would be pretty easy.  Add color control to the "addtomenu"
command, and use those colors during display.

I  would caution you  that the menu code is  supposed to be completely
replaced in 2.0.47 so  this wouldn't be  the best time to contribute a
patch to the menu code.

No, I don't have a date for 2.0.47.  (Other than soon.)

If you want, with the current code, you can  issue a Menustyle command
with a new color each time you popup a menu.  This  won't let you have
unique colors for sub-menus, so this may not be what you want.

Bad drawable pixmap or window parameter, these errors make me insane. Is
there any way to fix these? FvwmButtons causes these, looks like there
must be a right "combination" of buttons to prevent this. And its pain
when you add a new button you must remove old or add another.

     When I try to config the GoodStuff toolbar in fvwm I get problems
with trying to establish a remoet connection.  If I set up the button to
execute a telnet or rlogin I get an error that says:
	xterm: Can't execvp telnet esmail
		OR
	xterm: Can't execvp rlogin -l jewellce esmail

Why is this happening?  The xterm command I have in the GoodStuff line is:

*GoodStuff rterm.xpm  Exec "" xterm -T esmail -e 'rlogin -l jewellce esmail' &

Is this incorrect?

I am running X11R6 with fvwm 1.24r under MacBSD 1.2.1 SLOTMAN kernel and I
have a button on my toolbar set up for xmh but when I click on it I get
the following message:

Error: Cannot perform realloc

What does that mean?  How can I get xmh to work?

That should be:

xterm -e  uses all following parameters, not just the next one.

Hi,

Can anyone help me to solve the following two problems?

1. After modifying the .fvwm2rc file, how to take effect of it without
quiting fvwm2 and restart it again??

2. I want to change the Icon of my applications when iconified. But I
can't find the Icon path for it. Isn't it /usr/include/X11/pixmap?? or
where else??

Thanks.

Stephen

How embarassing. 

The FvwmIconMan-1.0.tar.gz file on ftp.cs.arizona.edu and www.cs.arizona.edu
until today was bad. It won't work with fvwm 2.0.46. This is because I didn't
incorporate changes made to FvwmIconMan when it was put into the distrubution
into my private source. 

I've replaced that file with a new version.
