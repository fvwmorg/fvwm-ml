You probably have some command that requires user interaction in
your config file, not necessarily in the InitFunction. Does it
happen too if you restart fvwm (with the 'Restart' command)?
Try to narrow it down by commenting parts of your config file.

1) You must have compiled fvwm with xpm support.

   If you have compiled fvwm yourself you have to make sure
   you have compiled it with xpm support. When you run 'configure'
   it will tell you this at the end.

2) You must set the ImagePath to point to your icon directory.
   (or the PixmapPath command in earlier versions).

     ImagePath path_to_icon_directory:another_directory_path:...

3) You must tell the applications which icons to use like this

     Style * my_default_icon.xpm
     Style netscape my_netscape_icon.xpm
     Style xterm Terminal.xpm
     ...

Use can use the 'Frame' option:

I have no clue why this happens (it doesn't for me). What Netscape version
do you have? Can you try adding these lines at the end of your config file:

  DestroyFunc UrgencyFunc
  AddToFunc UrgencyFunc I Beep

Does this help? (I don't think so).

To avoid page flipping when you open the window you could try to
de-iconify first and then warp to the window:

  + I iconify off
  + I warptowindow 50 50

(or so).

Most likely the '4' modifier isn't properly bound in X. What is the output
of 'xmodmap -pm'? Is there a '4' modifier at all? Is is bound to the key
you would expect?

We're always eager to hear comments from new users. Why don't you
write a few lines to describe that since you know best what you
would have liked to see in the man page. I will out it in the
appropriate place then.

We - the authors - think a bit differently about the man page. In my
eyes (and I think most of the other developers will agree) it's quite
lousy. It's much too large and not nicely structured.

We are working on a web page with screen shots. Could you please
convert it to .gif format and send it to me? I'll add it to that
page then.

No.

Not really, but you could use only the pixmaps without text and mini
icons. You would have to draw the text of the menu items into the
pixmaps and you won't be able to hilight the text.

I don't use it myself, so I'm only guessing. It seems that FvwmIconBox
has an icon representation of *every* open application in the box as
long as the application has the 'NoIcon' style set. I can't see a way
to remove de-iconified applications from the icon box. The are several
other modules to manage icons/windows: FvwmTaskBar, FvwmWinList,
FvwmIconMan and the builtin IconBox style. I recommend you try
the 'IconBox' style and/or FvwmIconMan.

Hi,

I think this question was just recently asked, but I forgot the answer, so
please forgive my ignorance.  Does fvwm2 have built-in scaling abilities
with xpm's for say the titlebar?  That is to say, can you tell fvwm2 to
use an xpm to decorate the titlebar and scale it to fill the titlebar
space?

Thanks,
Tom

I had to rebuild libXpm in order to solve the problem.
I believe that it stems from my move from libc5 to glibc.

  I'll have a play later.

  I *want* it to page flip! I was just remarking that although the icon
had migrated to (1,0), FVWM still [correctly] identified the window with
(0,0). Mind you, this is true of most apps: I've often had an icon
mysteriously appear on the wrong page, only for it to deiconise back into
the correct page.


  Here's something related to try: bind a key to 'Iconise' (Sun's "Open"
FKey for me). *Double* click/hit the key over an open window. Usually, the
window iconises, then deiconises (natch) ... but the window's transparent!
You only get the FVWM decor, not the window itself.

  I've just done this again to check it's still there - and I can't
remember how to get it back!

  My mistake: double-hit an 'Iconise' bound key over an *iconised* window,
and it ends up half iconised. Simply reiconising it fixes it. I'd
accidentally shaded it as well: that's why I thought I couldn't get it
back.

Eeek! Weird. I actually use a function that uses 'iconify' twice:

  key f1 i c iconify_twice
  addtofunc iconify_twice
  + i iconify
  + i iconify

The application seems to think it's still iconified while fvwm
thinks it's full sized. I'll look into this :-)

Why .gif?  For most recent (fancy) desktops, jpeg looks better and has a
smaller file size.  Or, for lossless compression, .png works well.

But it's really not important; I'm just nit-picking.  :)

After a brief dalliance with GNOME/Enlightenment/WindowMaker/Afterstep, I've
come back to my FVWM roots.

FVWM has a lot of advantages over these other window managers. But one
thing it hasn't got is a modern-looking logo. It would be nice if we had a
logo which somehow reflected its great qualities: speed, compactness,
elegance, efficiency... 

So, calling all artists! If you have some time and would like to make a logo
for fvwm, please send it to me at alanho@princeton.edu. I'll post all
submissions at http://www.princeton.edu/~alanho/fvwm/. Come take a look at the
one I made. Perhaps when we get a good one we the humble users can contribute
something to this great project. 

Alan

Nice logo. It would be well to have more artists participating.
Please consider keeping images in .jpg or .gif format, not .png or .xpm,
so the folks using Netscape Navigator 3 (or any other) could see them.
Also, please consider joining the Fvwm Logo Context by Pat Rogan at:
  http://members.tripod.com/~rrrogaine/fvwmlogo.html

Mikhael.

Simply because all our screenshots are already in .gif format.
There were some reasons for choosing gif, but I don't remeber
them and I really don't care either.

I actually have a dual head on my SGI, composed in fact of
2 Indys, 2 Monitors, but one Kbd/mouse. So I run two instances
of fvwm, and my mouse spans over through an X connection.

Now if you want to MOVE windows across the screen, which I
cannot do, you need xbigx or xpanx I don't remember. Have
a look at :

	http://www.x-software.com/Software/products.html

One nice feature is "Transparent Windows" where you can see
through the raised window what's happening on the lowered
window by a nice opaque effect. Very nice. And you can
move windows over as well. Oh, it's not free...

Are there any good resources for screenshots and associated .fvwm2rc
files. I've checked the site at www.fvwm.org but I can't seem to find
any up to date information ...

TIA

There is a "screenshots" section under construction.  Right now, its
mostly screenshots (not many .fvwm2rc files), and its only available
for CVS download.

Hopefully it will appear on our web site soon.

Anyone can download it and display it locally:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm checkout fvwm-web

(if CVS asks you to login, the password is "guest".)

You can then display it locally, using "file:".

If anyone would like to contribute, send your desktop as a "gif" to me
along with the caption you would like.
I'll take care of the thumbnail.

Lee, thanks for the timely question.

I noticed the fvwm2 I was using in Redhat 6 was not Gnome-aware, so I
found a snap and built it.  You have done a nice job. The desktops "map"
correctly and the funky behaviors I was experiencing with all apps
wanting to start on desktop 0 are gone.

I've come up with 2 usage problems, hope you could explain.
1. I had configured the alt-mouse1 key to move windows. This is a
standard window maker config that I like lots. It worked fine in
fvwm2-2.2.2, but in the snapshot, it has the funny behavior that it does
not work if I leave the alt key depressed after clicking. If I let the
alt key up and the mouse button up, then a transparent window frame
appears and I can move the window.

Is it possible to make it work the old way?

2.  My configuration was set so FvwmButtons would launch at startup.  It
no longer runs at start time. I can launch it within the session.  Is
there something about the gnome configuration that blocks having modules
at start time?

(I know, you think I ought to use Gnome stuff instead of FvwmButtons,
but I spent so much time on the configuration of it that I want to keep
using it.).

xmodmap -pm gives:

xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d),  Hyper_L (0x73)
mod3        Super_L (0x75)
mod4        Pause (0x6e)
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e),  Print (0x6f)

So, mod4 is bound to something, and yes it is the key I would
suspect. However, I don't think this is FVWM's fault now (I suspected it
wasn't, but mailed this list to make sure). My set of keybindings with the
`4' modifier work properly with the NumLock (!) on. My set of keybindings
with the `5' modifier work properly with the NumLock off (as they
should). So I think my X server is _very_ buggy. Thanks for the help. Any
suggestions on how to work around a buggy X server?

Since fvwm-2.3.1 there is the IgnoreModifiers command. Perhaps playing
with it may help you (e.g. ignoring no modifiers or only the num-lock
key). If you don't use the num-lock modifier you could switch it off
completely (in X). I have written a description of what to do in the
FAQ.

I don't think this will help, since I want to pretend like the NumLock is
on for mod4, but pretend it's off for everything else (since it will screw
everything over, presumably). I will try your suggestion, though.

I think it may be the `Pause' key -- perhaps it has some sort of special
meaning in XFree86? I assigned the `4' modifier to another key and all
works fine. Any ideas on what the `Pause' key is supposed to do?

With current development code I have no problem to make this work.
I use this binding:

  mouse 1 w m move

As soon as I release the button the move operation starts, regardless
of the state of the meta key. Can you check this with a current snapshot?

I guess you're starting FvwmButtons directly from the config file.
Try putting the line in your InitFuction/RestartFunction.

  I have:

xmodmap:  up to 3 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x6a),  Shift_R (0x75)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x16)
control     Control_L (0x53),  Control_R (0x7e)
mod1        Meta_L (0x7f),  Meta_R (0x81)
mod2        Mode_switch (0x14)
mod3        Num_Lock (0x69)
mod4        Alt_L (0x1a)
mod5        F13 (0x20),  F18 (0x50),  F20 (0x68)


  Note NumLock on mod3. My fvwm2rc contains:

IgnoreModifiers L3

  with:

Key L5         WTSFI  N       RaiseLower      # <Front>

  But under the 2.3.6 snap I'm using, <Font> only works with NumLock *
CapsLock off ...

That is what I am calling the problem. In 2.2.2, the move operation
begins with the click, not the release of the meta key.  What you
describe is a new behavior. I could probably get used to it, but I don't
like it because it is not consistent with the Window Maker behavior I'm
trying to immitate.  Also, the meta key behavior is not consistent
across actions within fvwm2. For example, to resize I use
meta-rightclick.  With that one, the meta key can be held down while
resizing.  Here are the key bindings I use

Mouse 1 A       M      Move
Mouse 3 A       M      Resize

I have this.  Why is it not working?

Along with the gnome support is support for session managment and that
may be causing your problems.  You can to do too things confirm that
the InitFunction is actually wunning (i.e. is the xsetroot working).  I
beleive something called SessionInitFunction and SessionRestartFunction
was added, so if you have a session manger, or fvwm thinks you have a
session manager then you want to use this.

Somehow a fix I made last year has disappeared again. I have fixed it
in the development tree, but this fix won't apply to the 2.2.2 sources.
If you have the sources you can make this patch:

In the file fvwm/add_window.c you'll find this passage:

  #if 0
	    XGrabButton(dpy,(i),0,tmp_win->frame,True,
			ButtonPressMask, GrabModeSync,GrabModeAsync,None,
			Scr.FvwmCursors[SYS]);
	    XGrabButton(dpy,(i),LockMask,tmp_win->frame,True,
			ButtonPressMask, GrabModeSync,GrabModeAsync,None,
			Scr.FvwmCursors[SYS]);
  #else

Replace the '#if 0' with '#if 1' and your problem should be solved.
I am not sure why this fix has been commented out again, but in the
ChangeLog there is the following entry:

	* fvwm/add_window.c (AddWindow): backed out a patch that caused a mouse
	binding problem

I guess this causes a problem somewhere else, so I won't make
any guarantees.

Bye

Yup, you're right. The 'N' modifier was broken. It works now.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Both fvwm 2.2.2 and fvwm 2.3.5 do not recognize tokens that are surrounded by
double quotes which contain embedded spaces.  In particular the line:

MenuStyle midnightblue "light blue" midnightblue "-adobe-new century schoolbook-*-i-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" fvwm

generates:

[FVWM][nocolor]: <<ERROR>> can't parse color light
  and
[GetFontOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get font -adobe-new, trying 'fixed'[FVWM][scanForPixmap]: <<WARNING>> Couldn't find pixmap  height

As system manager of the UMD astronomy department, this bug is a show stopper,
making me unable to upgrade past the current fvwm (2.046).  For the past number
of years I have been handing out a .fvwmrc with the above line to new users and
thus upgrading fvwm would now break most users' desktops.

If double quotes won't protect a token from being broken up then what is the
use for double quotes?  I can substitute LightBlue for "light blue" but there
is no getting around that some font names have embedded spaces.

Can you be more specific? How does your style line look like, what
are the GlobalOpts you use and what kind of placement styles do
you use?

I have this in my config file and it works:

  Style Netscape* StartsOnPage 0 1, SkipMapping
  Style * SmartPlacement, RandomPlacement
  GlobalOpts SmartPlacementIsReallySmart
  GlobalOpts RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage, CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage

Don't panic. The MenuStyle command has been completely rewritten and
obviously we forgot to handle quoting properly with the old syntax. It
is fixed in the development sources now. Anyway, you can work around
this bug by using the new syntax:

  MenuStyle * fvwm
  MenuStyle * Foreground midnightblue
  MenuStyle * Background "light blue"
  MenuStyle * Greyed midnightblue
  MenuStyle * Font "-adobe-new century schoolbook-*-i-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

This does exactly the same as the one line above. The '*' is the name
of the menu style (different menus can have different styles now).
The options after the name can be written on a single line separated
by commas:

  MenuStyle * fvwm, Foreground midnightblue, Background ...

Note that the 'fvwm' style has to be the first one specified as it
resets most other menu style options to a default value.

Bye

Hello,

Having made the switch from tvtwm, there's one thing I miss, namely
having a dynamic number of icon managers.  With tvtwm I had an icon
manager for each host I was logged into.  The config file 'IconManagers'
entry defined about 60 icon managers, one per host, but if I was logged
into 5 hosts then I'd only see 5 icon managers.  With fvwm2 I'd be seeing
60 icon managers all the time.

Is there a way of avoiding this?

Thanks,

Brian Keck

The "Single Logical Display" funtionality that you want is a
feature/limitation of X and the graphics subsystem -- not FVWM.

Hi!
I'm new on this list. I read many manuals, faqs etc, but couldn't fix
my problem: when i press fvwmtaskbar's "START" button it stays pressed
even if I close start-menu. It happened when i've upgraded my RedHat Linux
5.1 to 6.0, and fvwm2-2.0.46-10 to fvwm2-2.2-5.
How to solve this irritating problem ?

Just wait for the next release :-) We have fixed this in the
development sources already.

Hi,
  I decided to redo my .fvwm2rc file with FormFvwmSetup, and have found
a slight flaw with it. It creates module configurations in your home dir
called FvwmButtons, FvwmPager, etc.. but in the .fvwm2rc file it puts
this:

# Read config files for modules:
read ConfigFvwmButtons
read ConfigFvwmPager
etc...

so fvwm looks for ConfigFvwmButtons at starup but cant find it(because
its been named FvwmButtons). It was easy enough to fix, I just thought I
would let you all know.

thanks,
sa

Is there a way to start up an application in fvmw and nail it to the
panner automatically by setting some variable in the environment  ?  By
nailing the window to the panner, I mean that the window will appear in
the same position regardless of which paaner the user toggles to.

Thanks.

I think you want to make the window "sticky".
Check the fvwm2 man page for the word, "sticky".

	Sorry, I've been out of touch for a few weeks - I'm still trying to
catch up with my mail.

	In addition to what Dominik asked for, can you tell us *which* specific
windows misbehave? - i.e., each of the apps you mention has several
different windows with different names, which may cause matching
problems.

	I've never noticed a problem with xv. For Netscape, my spec is very
much like Dominik's (except for a different page), and it works fine.

	The Gimp, now...there's a different story. I thought it worked OK, but
I tried a few tests after reading your message, and I find that the Gimp
has its own share of weirdness. (YMMV - I'm still using version 1.0. I
also still have the old Motif version, which has no problems at all.)

	I have no problem with the main control panel (name: "The GIMP"); the
individual image windows (name: "image_window") also behave properly.
However,the startup window (name: "GIMP Startup") and the Tip of the Day
(name: "GIMP Tip of the day") misbehave rather strangely: they start up
on the correct desk, but always on the current page - as though the Gimp
is doing something to override the position we calculate for the window.

	I haven't had time to look into this any more deeply, but does yours
(which version, by the way?) behave this way, or do you see different
behavior?

	...  [time passes]  ...

	OK, I see that xv behaves similarly, only in a more annoying way.
Normally, I only specify the desk for xv - when I change the spec to
include the page, it goes weird on me. All the windows behave properly
except for the image window (which also doubles as the splash window
when it starts up) - this seems to be due to xv's habit of trying to
force a new image into the visible viewport. The image window does the
same thing as the Gimp windows - it appears on the right desk, but the
current page.

	It's been a good while since I've looked at the placement code, but
I'll try to find some time in my current 4-hour-commute day to glance
over it to see whether there's something we could or should try to do to
correct this.

	Hint:  it's under the Style command. Setting a window's style to
"Sticky" will cause it to be "stuck" (or "pinned", or whatever
terminology you like) when it's initially created. The style just
governs its initial state: you can still toggle it between stuck and
unstuck with the "Stick" command (a good thing to bind to one of the
titlebar buttons, and to have in a general Window-Ops menu).

Yes. There is a style option:

  Style my_application Sticky

If you have several such applications but only want one specific
to be sticky you need to give it a title that distinguishes it
from the other ones and use that title in the Style command.

I'm trying to get different icons for Gimp's different sorts of
windows. ie

wilbur.xpm - Main Gimp Window
gimpicon.xpm - Image windows
gimpmicon.xpm - Tear off menus

I have the following set in my .fvwm2rc. The Main gimp window gets the
correct icon as do the image windows (Via the match on "Gimp"). However
if I tear off the file menu in Gimp I get a window with the following

WM_CLASS(STRING) = "gimp", "Gimp"
WM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = "C"
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = "landlord.gbdirect.co.uk"
WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "File"
WM_NAME(STRING) = "File"

Which gets no icon at all!  Any ideas?

 Style "*"              Icon penguin.xpm

 Style "Gimp"           UseStyle NoButtons, Title, MiniIcon mini-wilbur.xpm, Icon gimpicon.xpm
 Style "The GIMP"       UseStyle WithButtons, UseDecor HelpDecor, Color white/midnightblue
 Style "The GIMP"       MiniIcon mini-wilbur.xpm, Icon wilbur.xpm
 Style "nxterm"         UseStyle NoButtons, NoTitle, MiniIcon mini-window.xpm
 Style "Eterm"          UseStyle NoButtons, NoTitle
 Style "xv"             UseStyle WithButtons, UseDecor Helpdecor, Icon xv.color.xpm, Color White/MidnightBlue

 Style "*File*"         Icon gimpmicon.xpm

Hi All,

I'm trying to get Linux set up on our home box.  I'd like my wife
to be able to use it, so I need a simple way to shutdown the
machine.  (I don't think she will want to su, enter the password,
and type shutdown -h now...)

I know this is probably not a pure FVWM question, and I appologize
if this is the wrong place to ask.  But, I'm looking for suggestions
on how to implement this.  Preferably, she would just have to click
a button or menu item (in X, with fvwm2) to cleanly bring the system
down.

Thanks for any help.

Matt

how about just setting ctrl-alt-del to shutdown instead of reboot?

in your /etc/inittab do this:

instead of "ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now"
do "ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -h now"

(RH system, but it should be similar everywhere)

Cheers,

Dan

Write a little shell script to run the shutdown command.

Install sudo on your system (see the man page, etc.)

Set up the sudoers config file to allow you, your wife, etc. to run that
script with root permissions.

Add a menu item to your FVWM root menu (or wherever) that invokes "sudo
/my/script/name".

I did this on my system and it works like a champ.  I actually have two
menu items, one to restart (reboot) and one to halt the system.

You can't use environment variables everywhere, but they
work in the Modulepath statement.

Subject: FVWM: fvwm2 on NT with Exceed?

Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

I've combed fvwm.org and searched with AltaVista, but can't find pointers
for compiling fvwm2 on NT in an Interix/Exceed environment (I don't have
the development version, but tried using cygwin). I've seen references to
people using it in the list archives.

Is there a location where I could find an fvwm2 binary for NT 4.0 x86 that
will work in Exceed 6.x (X11R6)? Failing that, instructions for building?
I'm a capable C programmer (though haven't written C in a couple years),
but have never compiled anything on a PC.

I will summarize responses for inclusion in the FAQ.

I've been happily using fvwm{,2} on Digital Unix for at least 5 years. It
would certainly make NT just that much less unpleasant.

Many thanks for any suggestions.

Actually, processing with FvwmM4 is ideal for this situation.  FvwmM4
predefines an OSTYPE variable so you can choose your paths based on
that.  If you want more granularity than that, and have an environment
variable set up for it (call it $ARCH for example), you can do
something like this:

fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-squote { -m4-equote } -m4-opt -DARCH=$ARCH .fvwm2rc"

> P.S. I'm currently using 2.0.46. Will the same .fvwm2rc files work

Mine required only a few minor tweaks when I moved to 2.2 and none for
the move from 2.2 to 2.2.2 except for removing a workaround for a bug
in 2.2 that's fixed in 2.2.2.  I haven't tried the 2.3.* yet, but I've 
read the manual.  I suspect that some tweaking would be necessary
there too, but it doesn't look like anything major.  In fact things
appear simple enough that with FvwmM4 you could easily have a .fvwm2rc 
that supported both versions.

This doesn't answer your question so I won't send it to the list.
I use fvwm on an Exceed server, I run it on the Unix host that I run
most programs on.  It works very nicely and is no slower than running
the window manager locally. If you do manage to get fvwm to compile with
Cygwin it would be nice to let us know how you did it so we can add it
to the configure stuff.  I'm not sure I'd use it though, I like to be
able to run unix progs from the window manager.

Cheers,
Tim.

Heya,

introduction:-

I am currently using fvwm95 on freebsd and I want to customise my menu  to
work with the current programs in the menu eg:- xview, maze,
acrobat,textedit, explorer etc. And I also want setup a menu called /stuff
that will include :- adobe acrobat 4, office(Applix) etc

Question:-

1)How can I customize my menu so I can run the current applications in
fvwm95?

2)How can I  add an additon to the menu called stuff to include such
applications such as adobe acrobat 4 , office(Applix)


Thank you for your assistance people.

  I have search all the docs and archive but have found no answer. hope you
guys can help me out.

  how do I make the transient (the little windows for search, open file
etc.) to automatically get focus? [when using sloppy focus]

  I remember that I've read about the module that would do this somewhere,
but can't find any information about it now. wonder if that was just my
imagination...

  thanks in advance

The 'GrabFocus' and 'GrabFocusTrasient' styles are implemented since
2.3.2. Note that this does not work well if the transients are opened
with the mouse from a menu of the application because the program
would immediately get the focus back when its menu pops down.

Danny,

     As many people will tell you this mailing list is for Fvwm2, not
fvwm95.  I assume that you are using a RedHat dist. with fvwm95 on it.  If
that is the case I might be able to help, just read on.

If the directory structure is the same on a freebsd system as on an x86
system then you should be able to modify both by simply looking at the
files in 

/etc/X11/wmconfig

If you peruse a couple of these files you will find that they contain the
name of the executeable, the menu in which they are listed and the name of
icons, etc.  Adding a file to this directory which conforms to the style
or syntax as displayed in the other files will show up in your menus.  If
you do not have root permision to write in this directory and your
sys-admin. is not willing to help, then your stuck modifying some of the
scripts used in the AnoterLevel package.

Hello all,

I made a hack to fvwm 2.0.46 which undoes the icon 'auto-compact'
feature - that is, an application's icon position is reserved for the
applications lifetime, rather than all the icons compacting down the
icon box. This is much like olvwm - I much prefer being able to
associate windows with their icon positions, and not have the wm
rearrange them when I'm not looking :-)

This kind of breaks with non-sticky icons when you un-iconise a window
into a different page and then iconise again, but works a treat with
stick icons.

Anyhow, the reason for this post:

1) is there a way to do this without hacking the source?

2) this hack essentially turns on the ICON_MOVED bit of the window's 
flags in icons.c:AutoPlace(), and removes the test for iconification
when figuring out where to layout icons (i.e. all windows which have
been iconised at some point are considered in the layout algorithm). Is
there a better way in 2.2.2?

3) is there any interest in making this a rc configuration? Any
suggestions for a name?

Regards,

Ben Low

I'm not quite sure what you are trying to do. I can't remember any
feature that 'auto compacts' icons, whatever that may be. Perhaps
you mean the icon boxes? You can define rectangles on the screen
where your icons should go (Style * IconBox ...). If you don't like
it, don't use it. Once an icon in the icon box has been  moved by
the user, fvwm won't move it back into the box.

Bye

  Is there currently a way of doing, e.g., what 'WindowList [xterm]' ought
to?

  Obviously, WindowList /doesn't/ take a 'Next'-like argument, but is
there a way of achieving this, other that adding the arg. to WindowList?

Anyone,

I am using Fvwm Version 2.3.6 compiled on Jul 26 1999 at 13:47:00

First thing I noticed in the .fvwm2desk file was this:

########## snippet from .fvwm2desk ##########

+               "I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x45+67+1 -name ssbun -title ssbun -bg
 antiquewhite -fg black -bd magenta4 -e rlogin -8 ssbun &
+               "I" Wait ssbun pts/101 /home/misha21 
+               "I" Exec xterm -geometry 80x45+306+204 -name ihlbb2 -title ihlbb
2 -bg antiquewhite -fg black -bd magenta4 -e rlogin -8 ihlbb2 &
+               "I" Wait ihlbb2 PCC=5e14_1b SS=prl VPTYPE=lab - /5e/lclb100/inte
am1b/hdr_app/5e14_1b/prl/poprules 

######### End of snippet #########

You can see that the xterm arguments "-title" and "-name" are followed by just
one word, but the "Wait" is looking for what I have my Title bar labeled with.

How can I get the "Wait" to only have the same word as the "-title" and "-name"
arguments?

Also I would like to use FvwmM4 to process this file but when I use the
following:
	fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwm2rc"
and have this
	"m4_include(`.fvwm2desk') .
in my .fvwm2rc file, I get the following error:
	m4: bad option: --prefix-buttons

So I ended up having to use FvwmCpp to process my file, but now I get a ton of
errors because I have a ton of comments in my .fvwm2rc file.

I wish it was as simple as putting in "read .fvwm2desk" in my .fvwm2rc file.

Well, right now my biggest problem is the "wait" portion of the .fvwm2desk
file.  Can anyone help me with at least this?

Thank you.

Bob Ford II

No. WindowList should really use the same options, as the conditional
commands, but actually it re-implements most of the flags functionality.

Edit the file? :)

Try taking the `-m4opt' out. The manpage for FvwmM4 says it's not needed.

Is this mysterious .fvwm2desk file auto-generated from someplace? If not,
why not simply edit the file to say `Wait XTerm' or what have you?

Also, if you don't want (or don't care) about m4 pre-processing, I believe
there is a command called `Read' in fvwm2. Check the manpage.

What I mean is the way fvwm (and some other icon-based wmgrs) layout icons
on the screen. Presently, fvwm fills the icon box to not leave any gaps.
This means icons don't 'stay put' - for example:

Wn - window id 'n'    In - icon for window 'n'

a)initial:       b)restore W2:    c)iconify W4:    d)iconify W2:
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
| I1        |    | I1    W2  |    | I1    W2  |    | I1        |
| I2        |    |           |    | I4        |    | I4        |
| I3   W4   |    | I3   W4   |    | I3        |    | I3        |
|           |    |           |    |           |    | I2        |
+-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+

So you can see that the icons have rearranged themselves, each time
begin 'compacted' into the first available space in the icon box.

What I like is for icons to stay where they started, in essence not having
the wm 'repack' the iconbox on every iconisation (<- is that a word??).

Manually placing an icon forces it to stay put by removing it from the
packing process. My hack sets all icons as though they are manually
placed. It'd be nice to know if this is doable via any kind of config
directive/s.

Regards,

Ben

Then you should upgrade your fvwm to a more current version. A quick
test reveals that the current development code does it the way you
describe and I bet the released version (2.2.2) does it too.

Of course it's autogenerated. Robert did mention he's using FvwmSaveDesk.
Still editing the file seems to be the only solution. There isn't an
automatic way to do this because the xterm obviously changed its name
at some time. Since the information about the initial title is lost,
the only way to find it out would to look at the command's arguments
which would require fvwm to know about the syntax of applications.
Another way is to not change the window title manually. From the title
in the example I guess Robert uses it to display information about the
pwd and the terminal connection.

I think you'd better read thru this again.
Whenever an icon is autoplaced, its placed in the first open slot,
regardless of its prior position.  (Unless its been moved.)

In my opinion, the functionality requested is reasonable.  I might
apply a patch if it was submitted.  (Hacks won't do.)

I think this is better described as "icons automatically remember their
place".

Hello everyone.
is there a way to make the root window swallow an application?
e.g. i'd like to have xconsole appear on the screen but to behave transparently
(to pass the mouse clicks to the wm)

thanks in advance
martin novak

Subject: FVWM: click delay in menu
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello,

I used to have the following menu when I was using Fvwm v.1 :

Popup "Utilities"
        Exec    "xterm"         exec xterm -e /bin/bash &
        Nop     ""
        Module  "identity"      FvwmIdent
        Refresh "refresh"
        Destroy "destroy"
EndPopup

This menu didn't have any title, and by using:

Mouse 1         R       A       PopUp "Utilities"

I could click anywhere on the root window, the "xterm" entry of the menu
would appear directly below the mouse pointer, be selected and it would
immediatly fire up an xterm window.

Now with version 2, I have the following:

AddToMenu "Utilities" "xterm" Exec exec xterm -e /bin/bash
+              "" Nop
+              "identity" Module FvwmIdent
+              "refresh" Refresh
+              "destroy" Destroy

Mouse 1         R       A       Popup "Utilities"

The behavior is the same, except that now there has to be a slight delay
between the mouse button press/release for the xterm window to show up...
I.e. before I just had to click and however fast I was doing it, it would
work. Now I have to press the button, wait a little, then release the
button, otherwise it doesn't work...

Does somebody know how to get rid of the delay ?

Thanks,

Philippe

I have seen this also.  It seems that fvwm2 thinks it is doing the user
a favor by not triggering the top menu item, if the mouse is not moved
just a bit between the press and the release.  I assume it is trying to
avoid an accidental root-window click from triggering something
horrible.  One never knows what might be at the top of some menu, and
the user could click by mistake...

I don't much like the behavior, though.  I'd rather be able to protect
myself by putting a title on the window, instead.  Since I design the
menus, I should get what I want.  :)

FWIW I noticed that too and didn't care to upgrade from 1.24r because
of it. :-)

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Dear Gurus,

I have fvwm-2.2 installed and it works fine.
However, I'd appreciate if somebody would tell me
how to bind "Ctrl-Esc" key sequence to the "RootMenu" Popup.

Also, It doesn't belong to fvwm, but maybe you know how
to emulate mouse using numeric keypad ? I have XFree86-3.3.3.1
for the reference.

Regards, ( )

 Ilia Chipitsine ( )

This should work:

Key Escape		A   	C       PopUp "RootMenu"

Put this line in your .fvwm2rc file:

  Key Escape A C Popup RootMenu

Actually, the title and the name of the menu may not be the
same. You must use the menu name in the command.

Put this in your .fvwm2rc

  Key KP_1 A A CursorMove -10p +10p
  Key KP_2 A A CursorMove 0 -10p
  Key KP_3 A A CursorMove +10p +10p
  Key KP_4 A A CursorMove -10p 0
  Key KP_6 A A CursorMove +10p 0
  Key KP_7 A A CursorMove -10p -10p
  Key KP_8 A A CursorMove 0 -10p
  Key KP_9 A A CursorMove +10p -10p

Alas, you can't simulate button clicks with the keyboard.
If fvwm generates a button press event itself it is marked
as 'synthetic' by the X server. Many applications ignore

thank you very mucho !
I just didn't know that I shall write "Escape" instead of just "Esc".
I found that "/usr/X11R6/bin/xev" tells me name of different keys.
But it tells "NoSymbol" if I press a key with flying windows on it ...
(I was that sure it's the same as Ctrl-Esc :-)

How can I assign a name for that key ? 

Regards, ( )

that's great. but I've no idea what is "alas" ...

I just read somewhere (maybe not about fvwm) that mouse emulating
code was removed from the window manager due to "powerful XFree86
features"

If you look closely at the xev output, you will see that
xev knows the "keycode" for the key.

Using xmodmap you can assign any keysym to the keycode.
Your "keysymdef.h" header file lists the keysyms you can assign.
Drop the "XK_" part.

I think you will find the header file in /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

Hello,

I sent the enclosed a few weeks ago, but never saw a response.
So I'm back with tvtwm/vtwm/twm/.  But I'd still like to join the
mainstream, so just in case someone is watching who wasn't before ...

>Having made the switch from tvtwm, there's one thing I miss, namely
>having a dynamic number of icon managers.  With tvtwm I had an icon
>manager for each host I was logged into.  The config file 'IconManagers'
>entry defined about 60 icon managers, one per host, but if I was logged

>60 icon managers all the time.
>
>Is there a way of avoiding this?

Thanks,

Brian Keck
