There is a really nice utility called MenuMaker.  It's a Python based menu  
generator that searches your system for programs that it recognizes, and  
builds them into a menu.  It supports several window managers, but  
unfortunately not fvwm.  It does support icewm, which is what I used to  
use before fvwm.

Since I'm somewhat familiar with icewm, its menus have a pretty simple  
syntax, and I wanted to convert my old icewm menu anyway, I wrote a Perl  
script to convert icewm menus to fvwm menus.  It works for me, but YMMV.   
I'm not much of a coder, and I haven't tested it very well.  If you try my  
script, please let me know how it works.  To see how to use it, run  
'icewm2fvwm_menu -h'.

List,
   I'm trying to make a touch screen kiosk, in the "discovery phase" at 
this point.  What is the fastest way to make a GUI app for FVWM?  All I 
need to do is a Q&A type of application.  I found how to make FVWM only 
run Netscape and could make a bunch of web pages, but I'd rather have a 
complete client side-application.  Do I use GTK, TK, TCL? I've never 
written a GUI for any Linux/X-Windows/WM/Desktop.  I'm looking for a 
pointer at the langauge that will allow me to build a nice graphical 
application (my own images for backgrouds, no window frames, buttons and 
such).  FVWM sounds like the right start, but how to make my own app?

You cold use them all.
Glade can be used to build an interface. (GTK)
Qt also has an interface builder, but I can't remember the name.
It's also possible to use a scripting language to use these guis.
Ruby for example has bindings for all these guis.

Fastest way? xdialog perhaps, http://xdialog.dyns.net/

Is it possible to avoid drawing the TiledPixmap under the titlebar
text? I.e. having the background pixmap on all the titlebar but the
title text.

Yes, this is possible in 2.5.x. You should use MultiPixmap instead of
TiledPixmap, see the man page. You may find examples in fvwm-themes and
other places.

It is a good idea to setup:

  Style FvwmWinList NeverFocus
  Style FvwmIconMan NeverFocus
  Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus
  Style FvwmTaskBar NeverFocus

Then you will not have this focus problem.

Yes, this is intended, the purpose of all these transient modules is to
choose a window or a page from the given short-lived table.

There is UnderCursorPlacement patch somewhere. But from what you
describe, I think you want the transient modules that go away on any
press or click. I don't think you want to have multiple pagers or
multiple windowlists on the screen that should be explicitelly closed.

Mikhael.

Try to ask the author of wmymail to add configurable window name (or
resources) from the command line. It is just several lines of code.

Well, no :-) I like the taskbar and pager to stay until I dismiss
them.  I am happy with every aspect of how they work now, without
Transient and without NeverFocus, except I want them to pop up under
the cursor.  Transient itself seems to me to do to many things.  Pager
disappears as soon as any key is hit, but WinList stays around longer.

This command brings the context window into the pointer in 2.5.x:

  Move $[pointer.x]p $[pointer.y]p

Use it together with FAQ #3.18.

We tried to hack wmymail, but ended up killing X with it :D
I found a workaround. I used program invocation like this:

*MAIL1 (Title box1, Swallow (UseOld, Kill) "Untitled" \
    `Exec sleep 1 && MAIL=$[HOME]/Mail/box1 && wmymail -w`, \
#         ^^^^^^^
    Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $[MAILPRG] -f $[HOME]/Mail/box1`)

*MAIL2 (Title box2, Swallow (UseOld, Kill) "Untitled" \
	`Exec sleep 2 && MAIL=$[HOME]/Mail/box2 && wmymail -w`, \
#         ^^^^^^^
    Action (Mouse 1) `Exec $[MAILPRG] -f $[HOME]/Mail/box2`)

... And so on. It works, only takes so many secons to start
up, as you have mailboxes. And for those of you who are going
to try the wmymail program, a word of warning: do NOT use
wmymail's -c switch, which executes a user defined MUA
program on click. It deleted my inbox! That's why I use Titles
on FvwmButtons.

Well, it doesn't say fvwm, but it appears that xfce/xfwm syntax is  
compatible with fvwm.  Oh well.  I wanted to convert my old menu anyway,  
and it was a good exercise.

I was able to use it just skimming the man page, thanks. But there's
something that still doesn't look right (I'm emulating TWM
appereance). There's not the same amount of space before and after
the title string; I didn't see any "offset" option ...

A little screenshot to show you what I mean.

Thanks anyway

The limitation of the Photon Hypothesis

 

According to the electromagnetic theory of light, its energy is related to the amplitude of the electric field of the electromagnetic wave, W=eE^2V(where E is the amplitude and V is the volume). It apparently has nothing to do with the light's frequency f. 

To explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein put forward the photon hypothesis. His paper hypothesized light was made of quantum packets of energy called photons. Each photon carried a specific energy related to its frequency f, W=hf. This has nothing to do with the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave E. 

For the electromagnetic wave that the amplitude E has nothing to do with the light's frequency f, if the light's frequency f is high enough, the energy of the photon in light is greater than the light's energy, hf>eE^2V. Apparently, this is incompatible with the electromagnetic theory of light.

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IS UNTENABLE

 

By re-analysing Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment and one of the thought experiment from which the uncertainty principle is demonstrated, it is actually found that the uncertainty principle cannot be demonstrated by them. It is therefore found to be untenable.

Key words: 
uncertainty principle; Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment; thought experiment 

 

The History Of The Uncertainty Principle

If one wants to be clear about what is meant by "position of an object," for example of an electron., then one has to specify definite experiments by which the "position of an electron" can be measured; otherwise this term has no meaning at all. --Heisenberg, in uncertainty paper, 1927

Are the uncertainty relations that Heisenberg discovered in 1927 just the result of the equations used, or are they really built into every measurement? Heisenberg turned to a thought experiment, since he believed that all concepts in science require a definition based on actual, or possible, experimental observations.

Heisenberg pictured a microscope that obtains very high resolution by using high-energy gamma rays for illumination. No such microscope exists at present, but it could be constructed in principle. Heisenberg imagined using this microscope to see an electron and to measure its position. He found that the electron's position and momentum did indeed obey the uncertainty relation he had derived mathematically. Bohr pointed out some flaws in the experiment, but once these were corrected the demonstration was fully convincing. 

 

Thought Experiment 1

The corrected version of the thought experiment

Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment


A free electron sits directly beneath the center of the microscope's lens (please see AIP page http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08b.htm or diagram below) . The circular lens forms a cone of angle 2A from the electron. The electron is then illuminated from the left by gamma rays--high-energy light which has the shortest wavelength. These yield the highest resolution, for according to a principle of wave optics, the microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

However, in quantum mechanics, where a light wave can act like a particle, a gamma ray striking an electron gives it a kick. At the moment the light is diffracted by the electron into the microscope lens, the electron is thrust to the right. To be observed by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A. In quantum mechanics, the gamma ray carries momentum as if it were a particle. The total momentum p is related to the wavelength by the formula, 

p = h / L, where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

In the extreme case of diffraction of the gamma ray to the right edge of the lens, the total momentum would be the sum of the electron's momentum P'x in the x direction and the gamma ray's momentum in the x direction: 

P' x + (h sinA) / L', where L' is the wavelength of the deflected gamma ray. 

In the other extreme, the observed gamma ray recoils backward, just hitting the left edge of the lens. In this case, the total momentum in the X direction is: 

P''x - (h sinA) / L''. 

The final x momentum in each case must equal the initial X momentum, since momentum is conserved. Therefore, the final X moment are equal to each other: 

P'x + (h sinA) / L' = P''x - (h sinA) / L'' (3) 

If A is small, then the wavelengths are approximately the same, 

L' ~ L" ~ L. So we have 

P''x - P'x = dPx ~ 2h sinA / L (4) 

Since dx = L/(2 sinA), we obtain a reciprocal relationship between the minimum uncertainty in the measured position, dx, of the electron along the X axis and the uncertainty in its momentum, dPx, in the x direction: 

dPx ~ h / dx or dPx dx ~ h. (5) 

For more than minimum uncertainty, the "greater than" sign may added. 

Except for the factor of 4pi and an equal sign, this is Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of an object. 

Re-analysis

The original analysis of Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment overlooked that the microscope cannot see the object whose size is smaller than its resolving limit, dx, thereby overlooking that the electron which relates to dx and dPx respectively is not the same.

According to the truth that the microscope can not see the object whose size is smaller than its resolving limit, dx, we can obtain that what we can see is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx and has a certain position, dx = 0.

The microscope can resolve (that is, "see" or distinguish) objects to a size of dx, which is related to and to the wavelength L of the gamma ray, by the expression: 

dx = L/(2sinA) (1) 

This is the resolving limit of the microscope and it is the uncertain quantity of the object's position. 

The microscope cannot see the object whose size is smaller than its resolving limit, dx. Therefore, to be seen by the microscope, the size of the electron must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit. 

But if the size of the electron is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx, the electron will not be in the range dx. Therefore, dx cannot be deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can be seen by the microscope, but deemed to be the uncertain quantity of the electron's position which can not be seen by the microscope. To repeat, dx is uncertainty in the electron's position which cannot be seen by the microscope. 

To be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, so we can measure the momentum of the electron. But if the size of the electron is smaller than the resolving limit dx, the electron cannot be seen by the microscope, we cannot measure the momentum of the electron.  Only the size of the electron is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx,  the electron can be seen by the microscope, we can measure the momentum of the electron. According to Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope Experiment,  the electrons momentum is uncertain,  the uncertainty in its momentum is dPx.

dPx is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum which can be seen by microscope. 

What relates to dx is the electron where the size is smaller than the resolving limit.  When the electron is in the range dx, it cannot be seen by the microscope, so its position is uncertain, and its momentum is not measurable, because to be seen by the microscope, the gamma ray must be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, so we can measure the momentum of the electron. If the electron cannot be seen by the microscope, we cannot measure the momentum of the electron.

What relates to dPx is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx .The electron is not in the range dx, so it can be seen by the microscope and its position is certain, its momentum is measurable.

Apparently, the electron which relates to dx and dPx respectively is not the same. What we can see is the electron where the size is larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx and has a certain position, dx = 0. 

Quantum mechanics does not rely on the size of the object, but on Heisenberg's Gamma-Ray Microscope experiment. The use of the microscope must relate to the size of the object. The size of the object which can be seen by the microscope must be larger than or equal to the resolving limit dx of the microscope, thus the uncertain quantity of the electron's position does not exist. The gamma ray which is diffracted by the electron can be scattered into any angle within the cone of angle 2A, where we can measure the momentum of the electron. 

What we can see is the electron which has a certain position, dx = 0, so that in no other position can we measure the momentum of the electron. In Quantum mechanics, the momentum of the electron can be measured accurately when we measure the momentum of the electron only, therefore, we have gained dPx = 0. 

And, 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

 

Thought Experiment 2

Single Slit Diffraction Experiment


Suppose a particle moves in the Y direction originally and then passes a slit with width dx(Please see diagram below) . The uncertain quantity of the particle's position in the X direction is dx, and interference occurs at the back slit . According to Wave Optics , the angle where No.1 min of interference pattern can be calculated by following formula: 

sinA=L/2dx (1) 

and L=h/p where h is Planck's constant. (2) 

So the uncertainty principle can be obtained 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

Re-analysis

The original analysis of Single Slit Diffraction Experiment overlooked the corpuscular property of the particle and the Energy-Momentum conservation laws and mistook the uncertain quantity of the particle's position in the X direction is the slit's width dx.

According to Newton first law , if an external force in the X direction does not affect the particle, it will move in a uniform straight line, ( Motion State or Static State) , and the motion in the Y direction is unchanged .Therefore , we can learn its position in the slit from its starting point. 

The particle can have a certain position in the slit and the uncertain quantity of the position is dx =0. According to Newton first law , if the external force at the X direction does not affect particle, and the original motion in the Y direction is not changed , the momentum of the particle in the X direction will be Px=0 and the uncertain quantity of the momentum will be dPx =0. 

This gives: 

dPx dx =0. (6) 

No experiment negates NEWTON FIRST LAW. Whether in quantum mechanics or classical mechanics, it applies to the microcosmic world and is of the form of the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. If an external force does not affect the particle and it does not remain static or in uniform motion, it has disobeyed the Energy-Momentum conservation laws. Under the above thought experiment , it is considered that the width of the slit is the uncertain quantity of the particle's position. But there is certainly no reason for us to consider that the particle in the above experiment has an uncertain position, and no reason for us to consider that the slit's width is the uncertain quantity of the particle. Therefore, the uncertainty principle, 

dPx dx ~ h (5) 

which is demonstrated by the above experiment is unreasonable. 

 

Conclusion

Every physical principle is based on the Experiments, not based on MATHEMATICS, including heisenberg uncertainty principle. Einstein said, One Experiment is enough to negate a physical principle.

>From the above re-analysis , it is realized that the thought experiment demonstration for the uncertainty principle is untenable. Therefore, the uncertainty principle is untenable.

Single Particles Do Not Exhibit Wave-Like Behavior

 

Through a qualitative analysis of the experiment, it is shown that the presumed wave-like behavior of a single particle contradicts the energy-momentum conservation laws and may be expained solely through particle interactions.

 

 

DUAL SLIT INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENT

PART I

 

If a single particle has wave-like behavior, it will create an interference image when it has passed through a single slit. But the experimental result shows that this is not the case Only a large number of particles can create an interference image when they pass through the two slits.

 

 

PART II

 

In the dual slit interference experiment, the single particle is thought to pass through both slits and interfere with itself at the same time due to its wave-like behavior. The motion of the wave is the same direction as the particle. If the particle passes through a single slit only, it can not be assumed that it has wave-like behavior. If it passes through two slits, it, and also the acompanying wave must be assumed to have motion in two directions. But a wave only has one direction of motion.

 

PART III

 

If one slit is obstructed in the dual slit interference experiment and a particle is launched in this direction, then according to Newtons first law, (assuming no external forces,) it will travel in a uniform straight line. It will not pass through the closed slit and will not make contact with the screen. If it has wavelike behavior, there is a probability that it will make contact. But this will negate Newtons first law and the law of conservation of energy and momentum. Both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are dependent on this law.

 

THE EXPLANATION FOR

THE WAVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR

OF THE PARTICLE

 

In the dual slit interference experiment, if one slit is unobstructed, particles will impact at certain positions on the screen. But when two slits are open, the particles cannot reach these positions. This phenomenon brings us to the greatest puzzle regarding the image of the particle. But when we consider that the particle may experience two or more reflections, the puzzle may be resolved.

 

As indicated, when one of the slits is obstructed, the particles that move towards this slit cannot get to the screen. However, they can return to the particle source by reflection and then pass through the open slit and reach the above positions since they have different paths when one or two slits are open. This indicates that wave-like behavior may be explained solely on the basis of particle interactions.

 

 

EXPERIMENTAL TEST

 

The above may be tested by an experiment that can absorb all the particles that move towards the closed slit. If one slit is obstructed by the stuff that can absorb all the particles that move towards it, the intensity of some positions on the screen should decrease

 

THE CONCLUSION

 

Single particles do not exhibit wave-like behavior.

The similarity of wave and particle behavior may be attributed to initial impulse and path.

The quantum mechanical explanation is suspect, since the probability of one particle and one particle among a large quantity reaching the screen is equal in mathematics and physics.

Hi all; I'm using Gnome 2.8 on Debian Sarge, with FVWM 2.5.12 (packaged
by Debian) as my window manager.  I'm also using fvwm-themes 0.7.0 and
fvwm-icons 2001.08.13, also from Debian packages.  This same thing
happened when I was using 2.6, and maybe before that.


My problem is that when I log in, I have 4 desktops configured and
visible in the workspace switcher applet, which is the default amount
for a Gnome system.  I can choose the desktop with the gnome-panel, and
move windows, and all that stuff.

But I want more than 4 desktops.  I can use the Properties on the
workspace switcher application to add more desktops, and they work
fine during that session.

So I log out (clicking the "save session" box).

But, when I log back in, I only have 4 desktops again and I have to
recreate them with the workspace switcher properties!!


This is pretty annoying.  Anyone have any ideas what the problem here
is?  Is it FVWM, forcing 4 desktops?  Can I configure FVWM to have more
than 4?  I found the configuration of pages per desktop, but I can't see
anything that forces a specific number of desktops.

Are you sure this is simply a case of you having to run:

gnome-settings-deamon &

from within ~/.xsession ?

Setting the "DesktopSize" command does this, i.e.:

DesktopSize 3x3

Would give me 9 pages. I assume it is "pages" you mean and not
"desktops".

As far as I know, Gnome listens to the EWMH-Stuff, so I think it
should work, if you do a

       EWMHNumberOfDesktops num  [max]

Or Something like that.

I'm sure this has been discussed before, but I can't help wondering if 
we can fix this forever by having a simple floating message (looks like 
a popup) for 2 seconds whenever FVWM starts up and has the num-lock key 
on (activated, etc). Just like GDM shows you a message when the caps key 
is on.

And like the FAQ says, whoever fixes this will get their names up on big 
letters on the site! :)

Hi,

tried to create my first script using FvwmScript today and ran into a
problem with receiving signals/messages. I followed the examples on the
FvwmScript manpage and it just didn't work. After having a close look at
the examples shipped with fvwm I realized that there's a difference
between the manpage and the examples.

Hi there,

finally I've documented my Fvwm2 setup a bit.  (People like watching me
using it, but nobody could deal with it.)  I can provide a screenshot
for the gallery.  But the main features are not visible.  It doesn't
show any titles or borders (IMHO waste of screen), some spare eye candy
(icon screenshots, some translucency, FvwmButton popup on the left).
Its intended to be very ergonomically (at least for me) operated by
keyboard.  Nearly all WM functions are introduced with an escape key
(C-m).  And now it also provides a dynamically updated help window
(invoking C-m ?).  I usually call it "GNU/screen emulating,
semi-self-documentating Fvwm2 setup".

A link to some (very brief) explanations:
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/comp.html#dotfiles>

Two small screenshots: 
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/media/sfvwm2_1.jpg>
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/media/sfvwm2_2.jpg> 

Two large screenshots:
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/media/fvwm2_1.png>
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/media/fvwm2_2.png>

The configuration itself:
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/dotfiles/_fvwm/>

Everything is likely to stay this place, so you can link to it.  I will
update it from time to time.  I will try to report bigger changes.

 Regards, Frank.

RTFM:
       Key Keyname Context Modifiers Function
                           [snip] Keyname  is one of the entries from the file
              /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, with the leading XK_ omitted,  but
              only  key names that are generated with no modifier keys or with
              just the Shift key held are guaranteed to work.  [snip]

So, you should take a look at /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.

HTH,
 regards, Frank.

Hi!

I just finished the first public version of Felidae. It's usable (I'm using
it for some time now) but there's still a lot to do.

You can find Felidae at <http://home.gna.org/felidae/>



What is Felidae?
================

   Felidae ist a collection of modules for Fvwm, written in Perl.
   Currently it contains:

   FvwmStorage
          FvwmStorage is a fvwm module written in Perl. It lets you
          define variables, load and store then from/to files and execute
          any fvwm command using this variables. It is especialy useful
          to interactively change the fvwm configuration.

   FvwmWallpaper
          FvwmWallpaper is a fvwm module written in Perl. It lets you
          change your X wallpaper from within Fvwm. FvwmWallpaper tries
          to find the best way to display your picture and resizes it if
          necessary. Resized pictures are cached. FvwmWallpaper can
          display a menu with thumbnails where you can select your

   FvwmOsd
          FvwmOsd is a fvwm module written in Perl. It lets you display
          an on-screen display (like the one on many TVs) on your X
          display. FvwmOsd is organized in different "channels" each of
          which you can configure and use independently of the others.

The FAQ question suggests the problem usually starts some time after
fvwm was started and everything worked well. The good solutions here are
"IgnoreModifiers L2" (this could even be the default if only Num_Lock
was always mod2), or using 'A' instead of 'N' for modifiers in bindings.
Note, Num_Lock is not the only modifier, usually there are also
Caps_Lock (ignored by default) and Scroll_Lock.

Regards,
Mikhael.

   use xev to find out what are the keysyms, use xmodmap to change 
modifiers (or set up your keyboard using xkb - see /etc/X11/xkb/)

Someone suggested xev, it is not the best tool to run in this situation.
Run xmodmap to see which modifier is Super_L. It is mod4 for me, so:

  Key F1 A 4 WindowList SortByResource, NoDeskSort, NoGeometry, NoHotkeys

* Mikhael Goikhman <migo@homemail.com> [2005-01-11 08:22:27 +0000]:
Thanx. It Works now
I use xmodmap -e "add mod4 = Super_R" to let Super_L = Super_R
and use "
Key F1	A	4	Desk	0	0
Key F2	A	4	Desk	0	1 
etc ...
" switch my desk now.

Thanks again.

As an experiment, I've created the config

Key Home W      M       Move +0 +0
Key Left W      M       Move +0 w
Key End W       M       Move +0 -0

Key Right W     M       Move -0 w
Key Next W      M       Move -0 -0
Key Insert W    M       Iconify

..with the idea that, by holding down the Meta key and pressing the
appropriate cardinal direction key, the focused window will jump to
that edge/corner of the desktop.

Problem: Mozilla uses Meta-Left for "Back".

Is there any way to define an exception case for a particular window,
or do I need to suck it up and configure (and learn) a different Modifier?

You may try to additionally press Shift or NumLock to make it trigger by
Mozilla and not by fvwm.

Or define an exception (you need 2.5.11+ for this):

  Key (Mozilla-bin) Left W M --
  Key (Firefox-bin) Left W M --
  Key               Left W M Move +0 w

I have upgraded from 2.4.17 to 2.5.12. In 2.4.17
I was able to use env variables directly in .fvwmrc,
for example:

*FvwmButtons: (Frame 2, Title $[HOST], Icon xterm.xpm, Action Exec 
"$[HOST]" exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -geometry 80x60 -sb -sl 500 -j -ls -fn 
6x13 -T $HOST -n $HOST &)
read ConfigFvwmButtons.$[HOST]

which gave me a button with the host's name and read in
more buttons depending on the host's name. This allowed me
to run fvwm on several hosts using a network file system, and
the buttons could be customized for each host. Now on 2.5.12,
"$[HOST]" is not substitued. Has this functionality changed,
and is it available via some other means? Or must I go back
to 2.4.17 (or rather 2.4.19)?

Note that I also went from RedHat9 to Debian at the same time.

I suspect your problem is that you do not have a HOST _environment_
variable. On my system, HOST is a local _shell_ variable, & (by definition)
not inherited by child processes.

To see if HOST was an environment variable or merely a shell
variable I did this:

env | /bin/grep -a ^HOST=
set | /bin/grep -a ^HOST=

I added this line to my ~/.zshenv file:

export HOSTNAME=${$(uname -n)%%.*}

& used $[HOSTNAME] in my .fvwm2rc file.

You might need to use slightly different syntax/files if you don't use zsh.

Hope that helps.

SCoTT. :)

Hi,

I recently updated my Debian Linux Box.
And so I got version 2.5.12 of fvwm installed.
After starting X11 with the new fvwm and my old working configuration
for 2.5.x FvwmButtons hangs using 99percent of CPU time.
And, after moving a window (in not opaque style), seems to freeze fvwm
for some seconds. And so, giving after the freeze following error message
 (the only on in the whole .xsession-errors file):
----------------------------
FVWM][FlushMessageQueue]: <<ERROR>> Failed to write descriptor to 'FvwmButtons':
- select rc=0
- terminate signal=N
---------------------------
So I installed, just for testing, version 2.5.8 from www.fvwm.org, the problem
had gone.

Some days later I was watching a movie with mplayer, I realised that the fullscreen
window of it did not pop up in front of every window (somewhere above Layer 7),
but stayed at Layer 4, hidden by FvwmButtons which stays fixed at Layer 7.
I hadn't changed the mplayer version for months, so I don't think it is an mplayer
problem. And gqview has the same problem now. :-( 

So I think it could possibly be fvwms problem, am I right?
Is there a possibility to make fullscreen windows go to the very top, maybe with
scripting (but only if the window is truly in fullscreen mode)?


PS: Now I'm using fvwm 2.5.8 on an Debian-testing-Linux x86 Box,
with XFree86 Version 4.3.99.12.

Hey folks.  There's plenty related to mouse button configs in the
archives, but I can't find anything that helps.

I just went and bought a trackball - one of those MS Opticals deals.
Pretty cool, but it's presenting me with a problem.  It has extra
buttons that I want to use in new and exciting ways.

My mouse config in xorg.conf is as follows:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "auto"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/ums0"
        Option      "Buttons"      "7"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
EndSection

And I have the following in my ~/.xsession file:
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"

And everything works as expected.  The main buttons, 1-3 (with 2 being
the wheel button) work the same as the mouse did.  The wheel rolls
button presses for 4 and 5, and the outer buttons register as 6 and 7.

My mouse buttons are:
Mouse 1         R          A         Menu RootMenu Nop
Mouse 2         R          A         Menu MenuFvwmWindowOps Nop
Mouse 3         R          A         WindowList UseIconName NoGeometry

but if I add these binders for buttons 6 and 7:
Mouse 6         R          A         Menu RootMenu Nop
Mouse 7         R          A         Menu RootMenu Nop

they just pop up the default menu, not the one I expect.  And to make
matters even more strange, they manage to cause the wheel to pop up
the default window when rolled on the root window.

If I change these binding to 4 and 5, the wheel pops up the root menu
when it's rolled either way, and the outer buttons do nothing.

Without the additional binders, the outer buttons behave as a
forward/back function in my browser, which was unexpected, but
welcome.  The question is how can I get these buttons to work for me
in the root window?  Hopefully this won't interfere with the
forward/back behavior in the browser . . .

Also, I think I'm not understanding the ZAxisMapping and xmodmap
setting quite right.  I was under the impression that the ZAxis
setting would make buttons 6 and 7 behave as scrollers, but the wheel
is actually using 4 and 5.  It looks instead, as if the ZAxisMapping
setting specifies the indices of buttons specified in the xmodmap list
to consider wheel rolls.  Does that make sense?

Thanks.

Possibly you have a ModulePath statement in your config file.
Remove it.

FvwmButtons doesn't go to Layer 7 by default, look in your config.

No I don't have an "ModulePath" statement in my fvwm config files,
neither in the system wide nor my own config.
I'm sure because I grep'ed for it.

No you missunderstood. I configured FvwmButtons to stay on Layer 7, so that no
window can overlap it, except for apps which use fullscreen, like mplayer or gqview.
Now FvwmButtons stays really ever over everything even over the fullscreen 
windows (e.g. from mplayer). 
Laying fullscreen apps to Layer 8 is no solution because:
1.) then they are ever in front even in windowed mode and don't go behind
2.) I have to configure it for every single fullscreenapp
Laying FvwmButtons in Layer 4 is no solution because then every other
window can cover it. :-(
So I need a flexible solution like a script I fear, or something is broken 
in new fvwm versions.

thx for advance

For this problem try:

Hi all,

Sorry if this is a terrible newbie question. The close buttons I use for
my title bar isn't drawn correctly. Since one picture sais more than one
thousand words:

http://home.student.utwente.nl/n.h.m.aandebrugh/buttons.png

I think most relevant information is given in that aterm. My full
fvwm2rc can be found at:

http://home.student.utwente.nl/n.h.m.aandebrugh/fvwm2rc

What gives? I made sure the pixmaps aren't too large (close button is
17x22, with a title height of 22). Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Niels

Nevermind. Pixmaps don't scale, this was the problem. And instead of
centering the pixmap Fvwm tiles it. I wasn't expecting this. Maybe I
should've read the 200+ p. FM. :-)

After some playing with ImageMagick and Gimp the small problem was
fixed.

hello, everyone

As we know, pressing on the Windows key brings up the StartMenu in Microsoft
Windows boxes. Windows keys can be used in fvwm, however, they are defined as
modifiers. That is to say, you can bind actions to them. I do not know whether
"any key" exists in fvwm or not, or any other trick to bind a certain action
to the windows keys.

for example :) 

Key "ANY KEY" A N 3 Maxmize


Thanks in advance!

   usually the win key is already bound to some key (not a modifier), 
use xev to figure out what it is. If xev does not show anything 
configure your keyboard. Keyobard configuration depends on distro but 
one way or another you need to figure out what to use in X config file 
which is usually /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4. Look for 
section that looks somewhat like this:


Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier      "Logitech Cordless iTouch"
         Driver          "keyboard"
         Option          "CoreKeyboard"
         Option          "XkbRules"      "xfree86"
         # Option                "XkbModel"      "logicordless"
         Option          "XkbModel"      "itouch"
         Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"
EndSection

   and choose your "XkbModel" appropriately (see files in /etc/X11/xkb)

I have desktop icons made using FvwmButtons with transparent colorset and
wanted the icon under mouse cursor to be highlighted (e.g. with increased
IconAlpha or something like that). 

Is it currently possible? I checked the list archives and found the
discussion[1] from Jul 2004 about ActiveColorset/PressedColorset for
FvwmButtons. As far as I understood the patch was committed but I can't make
it work. :-(

Hello, everyone

I am using FvwmIconMan to maintain the applications list. But now there is
a question for it. If an app, say emacs, stays in pager 1, and I am one pager
0 now. How can I raise emacs and navigate to pager 1 to see the 'raised'
emacs on click1 of IconMan? The desired way what I need is somewhat the same
as Window List , no matter where you invoke the windows list, you can go to
get it on selecting it.


Thanks in advance!

Leo

I suppose this is a two part question:

a) How can I see applications from all desktops?

Chage the Resolution option, try something like:

*FvwmIconMan: Resolution desk

b) How can I Warp to an application with IconMan?

You can change the Action binding to any function or command you like,
you can even string multiple actions together, this is what I use:

*FvwmIconMan: Action Mouse 1 N sendcommand "Iconify off", sendcommand RaiseLower, sendcommand FlipFocus

I do something similar to this but using two icons (one for normal, one when highlighted) eg:
*PanelBar: (1x1 icon panel/normal/firefox.png, ActiveIcon panel/hover/firefox.pn
g, Action Exec xwwwbrowser)

My activeicons are the same as normal icons just with the colors inverted but you can do anything you want this way.

Hi Andrew,

> wanted the icon under mouse cursor to be highlighted (e.g. with increased
> IconAlpha or something like that). 

If you want the icon to be highlighted, the easiest way to accomplish
this is to use 'Icon' & 'ActiveIcon'.

ie. 

*Buttonbar(Icon redApple.png, ActiveIcon greenApple.png)

If you only want the background to change, use:

*Buttonbar: ActiveColorset 21

SCoTT. :)

Ok, so I have some dynamic menus (FuncFvwmMenuDirectory) I use for browsing 
certain directories on my drive. Mostly my documents, movies and music 
directories. They worked and still partially do. Recently I modified my menus a 
bit and now my dynamic menus only allow me to browse 2 directories deep. It 
simply wont do anything if I try to browse deeper than that. My fvwm 
configuration is available for your viewing pleasure at 
http://apreche.net/~apreche/fvwm2rc

Thanks,

Oh, I have another question regarding dynamic menus bug. By the way,
thanks to everybody for suggestions on FvwmButtons :-)

I have a big partially-dynamic menu, a-la fvwm-themes where you can
customize colorsets, iconsets et cetera completely on the fly. The
problem is, generated menus are sometimes attached to the wrong
points, e.g. themes menu is attached to colorsets title in the parent
menu.

If I reopen the menu it shows fine sometimes, sometimes not, which is
somewhat annoying. his seems to appear more if the menu structure is
more complex.

Maybe there is something wrong with my scripts which generate menus, I
don't know. Maybe it is a FVWM bug.

My scripts/configs are here: http://bah.spb.su/~fox/fvwm/

Do you remember what did you modify exactly?

Can you please strip the config to several lines that show your problem
and post these lines here. Also you should attach (url) some example
directory layout that does not work as expected for you.

Without this, it is impossible to say anothing concrete. I just copied
your FuncFvwmMenuDirectory function definition plus the menus containing
"MissingSubmenuFunction FuncFvwmMenuDirectory" and everything works for
any subdirectory depth. (I changed paths a bit.)

Similarly, it is hard to answer anything concrete to Andrew Dolgov, since
he didn't strip his config to several lines that could be pasted to
FvwmConsole.

Personally, I don't think there are problems with dynamical menus in fvwm
similar to the ones described in this thread. Dynamical menus worked for
me without problem for years.

Debugging of dynamical configuration is not easy indeed. I may suggest to
create shell scripts and test them from the command line, and call these
scripts in fvwm configuration, instead of coding unix commands directly.

Regards,
Mikhael.

On the second try, I can reproduce your problem. Your large "sed" line
seems buggy, if you remove the pipe to sed, it will work well.

Like I suggested in the previous message, don't code unix commands in
fvwm config directly (unless you are good in debugging of such things).
Instead, create a shell script my-fvwm-menu that gets one parameter
(dir name) and does all the work, like setting icons/titles and calling
fvwm-menu-directory with correct parameters, and filtering using sed,
if needed.

Then test this my-fvwm-menu script from the command line, and after you
verified it works for all your directories, use it like this:

  DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
  + I PipeRead `my-fvwm-menu '$0'`

The DestroyFunc line is very important when you debug your config, it
ensures you always replace the function (or menu) definition and not
unintentionally add to the previous definition.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks! I thought it was something to do with the sed line. I'm not the best
with regular expressions. Also, thanks for the tip on putting that stuff into
another file as a script. I'll do that right away. Now, does anyone see what's
wrong with the sed script?  Is there a better way than that to set different
icons on different files? Using sed feels really hacky.

As,i know,
*MyButtons: (1x5, Frame 0, Icon 48x48/gimp.png, \
  Action(Mouse 1) "Exec exec gimp")
use this,I can start up gimp by click on the button.

  But how could i start gimp by double click on the buttons?
It seems mouse 3 or mouse 4 does no effect.

Try binding a function to the mouse button you'd like to double click.
 Then in the function have it run the gimp on double click and
optionally something else on single click.
Ex:
*MyButtons: (1x5, Frame 0, Icon 48x48/gimp.png, \
 Action(Mouse 1) DoSomething)

Define a function that starts gimp on double click, for example:

AddToFunc DoubleExec D Exec $*

Then bind Mouse 1 to "DoubleExec gimp" instead.

Hello.

I have some functions in my configuration designed for changing window
decorations on the fly using Read. Most of my decorations use for window
borders a colorset with "background" color set. I've recently added a new
decoration which uses "gradient" in it's window border, and I've found out
that after changing some decorations an update of this border colorset doesn't
work.

I've found out that doing:

#v+
Style * HilightBorderColorset 1
Colorset 1 fg "red", bg "blue"
Colorset 1 VGradient 32 "red" "green"
#v-

doesn't change the colorset on the window border. Is there any way to do that?
I tried to use "Colorset 1 Plain" but it doesn't have any effect, same as
"CleanupColorsets" (should I see all colorset settings disappear after this
function?).

I'm using fvwm 2.5.12, Debian package, XFree86 4.3.0.

Cheers,
harnir

The problem isn't nessecarily with the sed line itself its actually that the line length gets too long. Try shortening it like:
AddToFunc FuncFvwmMenuDirectory
+ I PipeRead 'test -f "$0"/.icontitle.png && mytitle="$0"/.icontitle.png;\
    fvwm-menu-directory -d "$0" --exec-title "^rox" --exec-file "^rox"\
    --icon-dir "folder_blue.png" --icon-title "folder_green.png"\
    --icon-file=__PIXMAP__ | sed\
    -e "s/__PIXMAP__\\(%.*.[mp3|MPG|ogg]\\)/sound.png\\1/g"\
    -e "s/__PIXMAP__\\(%.*.[png|jpg|JPG|jpeg|gif|GIF|bmp]\\)/image.png\\1/g"\
    -e "s/__PIXMAP__\\(%.*.[avi|mpg|AVI|MPG|mpeg|MOV|mov]\\)/video.png\\1/g"'


This worked for me (browsed 8 levels deep)

en,I have tried this,But something isnot go in the right way.

When I Click/Double click,It can run the echo command.
Only when I click the button by three times,the gimp will be run.

So,it does a effect to exec gimp by click the button 3 times...

I have a similar problem with FvwmIconMan.  I have this:

*DesktopIconMan: action     Mouse   3       N       sendcommand  
WindowMenuOrCloseIconMan

DestroyFunc WindowMenuOrCloseIconMan
AddToFunc WindowMenuOrCloseIconMan
+ I     Menu WindowOpsSmall c+0 -101m
+ D     Close

I have to triple click to close, but if I change it to '+ C Close', it  
closes with a single click.

Can we have Kevin Shiel permanently banded from this list. This was an 
absolutely disgusting post about kiddie porn, and I hope Canada has a 
law against this and puts him in jail.

You mean switch keyboard focus to it, or warp to it?

If you mean switch keyboard focus, try some combination of the
FPGrabFocus Styles, eg:

Style * FPGrabFocus

I don't think there is a preset style for warping to new applications,
but you can use the generic solution in faq #3.18 if that's what 
you're looking for :)

Hi Dennis, 

as strong as I support any actions to ban child pornography, I must ask you to
actually have a look at the website. I can't see anything to do with any kind of
pornography on this site. 
It is a fan-site for japanese "Manga" and "Anime" Art. 

I believe this mail by "Kevin Shiel" is not to spread pornography but to
discredit the website or something related to it. No Idea what. 
At least I can't imagine anything else...

Regards, 

Julian

It doesn't matter what the post is about. It simply has no place on this mailing 
list. Can we please apply some sort of spam filter at the server to prevent 
things like this?  I would use my own bayesian filter to do it, but if I start 
marking things from the list as spam, it will get a lot of false positives until 
it learns the difference.  Other mailing lists I am on employ spam filtering, 
why not this one?  Also, I believe that anyone who spams the list, regardless of 
  the content, it should be one strike, you're out and permanenetly banned.

I try to modify some examples from the internet.(Because I like the

removed)
But I found I use alt-tab will cause fvwm to crash and back to the xdm
login screen. I don't know what's wrong with my setting.

What fvwm version do you run?
Do you get "core" file?

Can you tell the version of Fvwm2 you are using?  It doesn't crash here.

Hello, 

i worked on a small utility that you can call from fvwm,

which is used to bring forth and back any X application :

i use it for mutt (in xterm), gaim, and other utilities 
i like to have everywhere i want on my desk, and yet
without taking space on my desk. (may be a  icon tray
would be the thing)

this utility find the windowid in the xwininfo -root -tree ;
then stick it.

it is used as follow : 

Key F4 A N  Piperead "app-get 'Buddy List'"
Key F4 A S  Piperead "app-get -r 'Buddy List'"
Key F10 A C  Piperead "app-get sortmp3;app-get -g 'XMMS -';app-get xmix"


app-get -g means grep in the list. so, app-get -g 'XMMS -'  
will get anything like 'XMMS - my mp3 track title here'

app-get -r is "reload". sometimes the windowid changes
(if you restart the app for example). it is used to 
re-scan the xwininfo list and re-find the id.

hope it will be usefull.

bye

Search for file like "core" or "core.13579" in your starting directory.
If it is compiled with -g flag (that I doubt if you use deb), then
type "gdb fvwm core" and then "where" and post relevant (or all) lines,
but only if you see source file lines together with C function names.

If your fvwm binary does not contain the debug info, then the only way to
find the source of this problem is to compile fvwm manually and try to
crash fvwm to get this core file. [There are cases when rebuilding may
"fix" a problem if it was system related, i.e. bugs in gcc or libraries.]

Mikhael.

Good day,

I have just started using fvwm2 and ran across this little error. I
googled for a bit, but didn't find anything similar, so I'm posting here
in hopes I can beg for a little help to resolve it. 

It seems I can trigger an endless loop for fvwm2 by trying to scroll in
a drop-down box under xine-ui's configuration dialog. I believe it is an
interaction between the widget set (Xaw?) that xine uses and fvwm2. When
the drop-down is selected, it looks fine, but as soon as a scroll is
attempted either with the mouse wheel or clicking on the scroll bar
inside it, fvwm2 takes over the drop-down box as if it were opening a
new window. Visually you can see the drop-down box gets repainted to
have window manager decorations around it. At the same time it loses all
the information inside it, while I can see some flickering as if the box
is being repainted over and over very fast. After this, fvwm2 is
unresponsive to any keyboard or mouse events. However, I can still kill
the xserver, or switch to a vt and see that other processes are still
running, which I intrepret as Xserver keys still be interpreted but fvwm
commands not.

The specific sequence to trigger this is: 1. Click on xine's setup
window icon on the player panel. 2. Select to the video tab. 3.Click on
the drop-down arrow next to "video driver to user". 4. Now try to scroll
in that menu to lower entries

I guess that was a long setup for the real questions. 1. Has anybody
else had this problem (and a fix?) 2. Should I file a bug report or vet
this out in the mailing lists/irc first?

Versions:
fvwm-2.5.12 with fvwm-crystal
xorg-x11-6.8.1.902
xine-ui-0.99.3

Thanks for any and all responses,

Regards,
-Alex

Hi,

I have a feature-request regarding the Style command. :-)

It would be really nice to have an ability to specifically request
what window property to match on,
e.g. Style ClassName BlahBlah ... or Style Resource BlahBlah, maybe
even with boolean expressions.

Reason: some applications use common classes like "Window" or
"program" and/or use the same class on different windows (for example,
IM client main window and conversation windows) which could cause
wrong styles being applied to wrong windows when using current
fuzzy-logic matching.

Just for closure, I wanted to share what I found. As I said
in my original post, I had changed from RH9 to debian at the
same time that I upgraded fvwm. Under RH9 I had disabled the
graphical login screen and just ran a "startx" script once I
logged in (I forget why I had set it up that way). On debian
I had left the graphical login screen (gdm) enabled, and thus
X was being started from somewhere other than my userid, thus
my shell was not being run prior to starting X... thus $HOST
was not setup to any value. I have not found a way to get gdm
to set env vars and use an .Xdefaults, but I have disabled
gdm and now manually start X and fvwm and everything works.

Hi i was wondering if someone knew a nice way to fix a "Fullscreen" function 
that i have here.

The function now as i have it (not written by me, taken from fvwm-crystal) 
basically just saves the current state of a window, moves it to the top left 
corner of the screen, and resizes to the max of the screen.
After that some WindowStyle options are set.

Since i am using Xinerama with these settings:
XineramaSlsScreens 2  1280x1024+1280+0 1280x1024+0+0 
XineramaSls On
XineramaPrimaryScreen 0
Xinerama On

It would be nice if the function:
1. Decides on what Xinerama the window resides and adjusts the Move command to 
move it to the top left corner of the Xinerama screen.
2. Fullscreens only within the XineramaScreen it is in.

Unfortunately i have no idea how to do this.
The Function(s):
###########
DestroyFunc Fullscreen
AddToFunc Fullscreen
+ I Fullscreen-Stop
+ I Current (!Maximizable) Break
+ I TestRc (False) Fullscreen-Start

DestroyFunc Fullscreen-Start
AddToFunc Fullscreen-Start
+ I Current (State 0) Break
+ I SetEnv OldX-$[w.id] $[w.x]
+ I SetEnv OldY-$[w.id] $[w.y]
+ I SetEnv OldWidth-$[w.id] $[w.width]
+ I SetEnv OldHeight-$[w.id] $[w.height]
+ I Move 0p 0p
+ I Resize 100 100 frame
#+ I Layer 0 5
+ I WindowStyle NoTitle, !Borders, StaysOnTop, !Iconifiable, !Maximizable
+ I State 0 true

DestroyFunc Fullscreen-Stop
AddToFunc Fullscreen-Stop
#+ I Current (!State 0) Break
+ I DestroyWindowStyle
+ I State 0 false
#+ I Layer 0 4
+ I PipeRead "echo ResizeMove \\$\\[OldWidth-$[w.id]\\]p 
\\$\\[OldHeight-$[w.id]\\]p \\$\\[OldX-$[w.id]\\]p \\$\\[OldY-$[w.id]\\]p"
##########

Perhaps someone could also tell me how to fix the following problem (The above 
is sort of a workaround for this problem):
Programs that really support fullscreen like mplayer always fullscreen over 
both monitors..? How can i configure my setup so that these programs detect 
the correct width of the monitor there on ?

All the xinerama stuff still behaves somewhat strange on my setup and i really 
don't understand why, other things i notice are:
1 mplayerplug-in: When embedded in a browser it shows half of the screen, only 
when I fullscreen/restore i see the whole "picture"
2 kcontrol (Desktop -> Panels) allows you to identify your xinerama screens, 
when I click "Identify" it shows the "1" in the center of the 2 monitors, and 
the "2" centered (like it should be) on the left/secondary monitor.

Hope u have the awnsers !

Mark,

I also use xinerama and fvwm, but I do not have these problems.  At least I 
don't have them when specific applications correctly support xinerama.  For 
example, mplayer works correctly for me not spanning both screens, but always 
filling just the screen I want it to be on.  This is because of two things. 
First of all I run gentoo and I have the xinerama USE flag set.  This means that 
if there are any compile-time options to include or disclude ximerama support it 
will always be included. Second, I pass the proper command line arguments and 
have the correct configurations set for programs where this is an issue. For 
example the very last line in my /etc/mplayer.conf is xineramascreen = 1.  This 
makes it so whenever I full screen mplayer it fills up only my second xinerama 
screen, it works beautifully.  Mplayerplug-in works the same way.

As far as writing an fvwm function which will correclty full screen any 
application that will be difficult. I imagine you will have to write a seperate 
function for each app to get it to move and resize exactly right depending on 
which screen it is on.  Your best bet is to use only programs which support 
xinerama properly and to configure them to act accordingly.

Also, if you use NVidia twinview, which I do, then setting metamodes in your X 
config is very important. I used to have only one mode so when I made games go 
full screen they would stretch out across both screens. I created a metamode 
which turned off my crummy monitor and only enabled my lcd. Now when I full 
screen games at 1280x1024 my crt turns off and the game is correct.

I hope this helps. If you have any more specific questions just ask. You can see 
my ever-changing fvwm config is at http://apreche.net/~apreche/fvwm2rc.

Ok I forgot to mention that I use Twinview and not xinerama, sorry for that.

I have tracked down the issue, wel a little bit.. I use a config with a 
GF4-4600 ultra with 2 flatpanels in Twinview mode + a PCI card with only a TV 
attached. 

So i have 2 screens :0.0 (Twinview) and :0.1 Single screen on my TV, i have 
removed the TV config parts from my xorg.conf and it works like it should 
now :-)
So I guess this is a driver issue, wel it sucks because I really like the 
whole "Rightclick -> TVplay" stuff I have in konqueror...

What I hoped to recieve in response to the question about fixing the 
FullScreen function was some code (FvwmScript??) that would let me detect 
what half on the Xinerama screen a window is on. I was hoping I could learn 
from that and make functions which would for example open a new firefox 
window in the secondary screen when the primary screen already contains a 
firefox window. Stuff like that would really make the whole xinerama stuff 
really cool.

Again sorry for not providing you with the full details of the problem, I 
tested it with kde after I send the question and the problem was the same 
there.. no fvwm problem really.

So is any of you guys running fvwm-crystal with Xinerama/Twinview, if so and 
you already fixed some stuff that doesn't work well now please let  me know.
I have fixed most of the problems but not all, and some not very elegant, I 
have my config in a cvs repo now so perhaps we can share..

Mark.

hi guys:
	I have two machines and two LCD's, so I use x2x to move between
	screens, and sort of use it as a big LCD, because the two machines
	are on a NFS partition. I could watch a PS document while editing
	the latex source ....


	I don't like to use mouse, either to click in the x2x window, or to
	move to the left boundary. I want to use  keyboard only. 

	currently I'm trying a way: first "warptowindow" to inside the x2x
	window, then "FakeClick" it, and record the current pointer position
	to a file. then I'm in the remote desktop, when I come back, I move
	to that postion again, and double click with "FakeClick".

	the problem seems that when I move to the remote display, the way to
	back out seems to be "Alt+double click", then click on anywheere
	outside the x2x window. ( this is different than x2x doc, I don't
	know why). --------- Problem is, I don't know how to do a fake
	"Alt+double click" .


	anybody hacked x2x??? friends told me, the "-west" etc options
	basically places an invisible window on the border, and focusing on
	that window moves X control to remote, if we could hack that window
	to be normal winodw, then moving arround is much easier.....


	Y

2.5.10 is a beta release.  If you wish to report a bug in
a beta release, first get the current beta release and try that.

Hello everyone,

I'm a pretty new Fvwm user, but I feel like I'm really getting the hang 
of it.  I've been putting a lot of time into my Fvwm config recently, 
and I've finally hit a road block.  My current goal is to have Urgent 
windows flash quietly without steeling focus, and I've done it.  I use 
two alternating functions, each of which swaps the colorsets and then 
Schedules the other one.  It works great.  The problem is that I can't 
see it from other pages because FvwmPager only updates the color when 
the window has focus.  If the flashing window has focus, the pager 
updates fine, but that doesn't really help for what I'm trying to do 
with it.

Because of the focus thing, I tried writing a "blipfocus" function that 
uses states to save the current window and then jump the focus to the 
urgent window and back.  That didn't work unless I added a delay before 
bringing the focus back (FvwmPager uses polling for that I guess).  
Again, switching the focus for any non-negligible ammount of time 
undermines what I was trying to do in the first place.

Doing a window operation like WindowShade or Iconify updates the shape 
in the pager, but still not the color, and when I switch to that page 
the haywire window is a really ugly effect  So it's not really an ideal 
solution, but it's what I'm using for now.

So my question is:
Is there anyway to force FvwmPager to update the color sets (and 
possibly the mini icon) of an unfocused window?

Any suggestions are welcome.  Or, if you have a completely different 
idea for urgent window handling I'd be interested to hear that too.  And 
if anyone needs code for periodically alternating a window's style, I 
can hook you up ;)

Thanks,
Mike

That's number 16 in docs/todo-3.0:

 16) Expand Style command to support name=pattern syntax.
     Style (Name "File *", Class XPaint, Resource *browser) NoIcon

There's no telling when it will get done.

That's QT, not Xaw.
I was easily able to break out of the loop by clicking on the window
kill button.

I was able to reproduce the problem.

Perhaps one of the EWMH options will help.
I'll look later.

Hello.

The window-specific key bindings seem to work in a strange
way. Fvwm still catches the event, but, if the window does
not match the conditions, tries to send it to the application.
No wonder that it does not work sometimes, for example, for
xterm with "allowSendEvents: false". Application does not get
the event.

I think this should at least be noted in the documentation.

It's been a long time since I last used FVWM, and much seems to have
changed -- so much so that I'm not even sure I have the right words for
what I'm about to ask. Please bear with me . . .

I use a single display but I love the "multi-desktop pager thingy" that
lets me pretend I have multiple displays. Unfortunately, I can't seem to
control edge scrolling the way I'd like. When I move the mouse to an
egde of the current screen (desktop?) *not* while dragging a window I
want it to just stop. The default behavior seems to be to jump to the
next screen (desktop) -- and that's what I *don't* want to happen.

BUT . . .

When I'm dragging a window, I want to be able to slide some portion of
the window off the edge of the current screen. I do not want to be able
to move the window to another screen this way, and I don't care where
(or even if) the "hidden" portion of the window appears. All that
matters is that the "leading" edge of the window (that is, the one
that's about to go off the side of the desktop) doesn't stop at the edge
of the screen.

I can't seem to find the right combination of EdgeResistance and
EdgeScroll to make this happen, nor can I seem to find another way to
accomplish what I want.

Can someone please help me?

Before you ask to see my .fvwm2rc file: I copied the system default file
and so far this is all I've changed.

Please reply directly to me as I'm not subscribed to this mailing list
(although maybe I'll wind up subscribing if it turns out I can't post
without being a member).

Thanks,
AdamM

In my setup there is a little resistance to moving a window over
the edge (which I like), but if I drage it far enough the window
will slide partway off the screen. Also the mouse stops at the
edge and no paging occurs due to mouse movement. I think the
control to use is:

EdgeResistance 10000 100

but I've attached my .fvwm2rc just in case.

PS: I did not write this from scratch, I just have tuned it a bit.

If I'm reading this right what you want are multiple desktops, each
1x1 screen big.  Right now you have one (or more desktops), each one more
than one screen.

Try setting "DeskTopSize 1x1" and starting your pager with
"module FvwmPager 0 3" (in InitFunction and RestartFunction).  That will
give you four desktops that you cannot flip between without clicking on
the pager (or using some key sequence).

Hi all!

I have finished my fvwm-page with my config. Visually I don't think
there are many new things, but I have an extensive list of
keybindings and some (I think) new functions:

- You can assign numbers (up to 10 per screen) to windows and jump
  to them quickly using the keyboard.

- Names not only for desktops, but also for pages within desktops.
  You can navigate and move windows using these names (see
  screenshot).

- Creation and destruction of desktops "on the fly" (in reality is
  only a restart of FvwmPager, but it looks impressive for
  non-experts ;-).

- Automatically sorting of shaded windows to keep the desktop clean
  (see screenshot).

- Mail programm (MUTT) and a full-screen console accesible
  everywhere with only a keystroke.

You can find it here:
http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~vilar/fvwm.html

Greetings,

David

For a while I've had a button bar at +0+0, but now I want to move it.   
Unfortunately, I've had quite a bit of trouble doing this.  When I use the  
config below, with the "Module FvwmButtons DesktopButtons -g +0+116", I  
get a really small (16x16) FvwmButtons at the correct location.  If I use  
"Module FvwmButtons DesktopButtons", I get an FvwmButtons at +0+0 and of  
the correct size.

Thanks,

jpkotta

Hmmm, there seems to be a bug with the "ButtonGeometry" command.

For now, use the "Size" command.

ie.

KillModule FvwmButtons DesktopButtons
DestroyModuleConfig DesktopButtons: *
 
*DesktopButtons: Geometry +0+116
# *DesktopButtons: ButtonGeometry 16x16
*DesktopButtons: Columns 8
*DesktopButtons: BoxSize smart

*DesktopButtons: (Size 32 32, Frame 0, Swallow "xclock" "Exec exec xclock")

Module FvwmButtons DesktopButtons

I'll look into the ButtonGeometry bug later.

SCoTT. :)
