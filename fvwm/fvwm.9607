I was just wondering which shell .fvwm2rc uses (because I want to use
environment variables in setting up title bars, etc.).  Also, is there
any way to put things like "if-else" statements in .fvwm2rc?

Thanks

 Hi.

  First of all, I would appreciate any answers that would even get me
started in the right direction. 

   Is there a way to dynamicaly (w/out reloading the config file) assign a
key shortcut to a window ? (e.g. upon pressing a the shortcut, fvwm jumps
to the section of vitual desktop where the window is)

   Is there a way to do it statically ? (by reloading the config file)
E.g. have certain viewports into a desktop on the Alt-Shift-F<n> keys.


      Thanx,

           Jan

Not sure quite how you want it to work, but here's one approach...

This will set things up so that clicking on the third button on the left
in the titlebar of a window will make <Alt><Shift>F1 a shortcut for that
window; generalizing it is left as an exercise :-)

1) Put the following perl script into your ModulePath under the name
FvwmWarpTo:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    open(WINID,"/tmp/shortcut");
    $winid = hex(<WINID>);
    close(WINID);
    $fd = $ARGV[0];
    close(STDOUT);
    open(STDOUT, ">&$fd");
    print STDOUT pack("lla6l", $winid, 6, "Focus", 0);

2) Add the following lines to your .fvwm2rc file:
    Mouse	0	5	N	Exec	echo $w > /tmp/shortcut
    Key		F1	A	SM	Module	FvwmWarpTo

The way it works is:
    - the titlebar button is bound to the action of writing the window
	id ($w) to a temporary file;
    - the shortcut key calls the perl script, which reads the window ID
	from the temporary file and spits a Focus command for the window
	back to fvwm2.

Note: this is only intended as a rough example.  With a little work,
this could probably be turned into a much smoother mechanism; if anyone
thinks it would be a worthwhile addition to the distribution, say so and
I'll whip it into shape....

HTH,

The following is not what you asked for, but may be useful
nevertheless.  When you bind `Module FvwmForm SelWin' to a key, that
key pops up a window.  You can enter the name of a window in there (or
a substring thereof), hit enter, and you'll be warped to the first
window that matches this substring.  (You may also be able to use `*'
as a wildcard, but I'm not sure.)

Add the following to your .fvwm2rc:

##########################FvwmForm#Select#Window########################
*SelWinWarpPointer
*SelWinFont         *helvetica*m*r*n*14*
*SelWinButtonFont   *helvetica*m*o*n*14*
*SelWinInputFont    *cour*m*r*n*14*
*SelWinFore         Black
*SelWinBack         Light Gray
*SelWinItemFore          Wheat
*SelWinItemBack          Gray50
# begin items
*SelWinLine         center
*SelWinText         "Select Window"
*SelWinLine         center
*SelWinText         "Pattern:"
*SelWinInput        WinPat  20   ""
*SelWinLine         expand
*SelWinButton       quit "Go"        ^M
*SelWinCommand      Next [*$(WinPat)*] Function GoThere
*SelWinButton       restart   "Clear"
*SelWinButton       quit "Cancel"  ^[
*SelWinCommand Nop

All of this has been shamelessly stolen from some FvwmForm example.
If forget which one, though.

I use this often.

...an obvious enhancement to my previous solution:

To do the same thing without the temporary file:

Key	F1	A	SM	Nop
Mouse	0	5	N	Key F1 A SM Module FvwmWarpTo $w

The perl script becomes:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # this could use some error checking...
    $winid = hex($ARGV[5]);
    $fd = $ARGV[0];
    close(STDOUT);
    open(STDOUT, ">&$fd");
    print STDOUT pack("lla6l", $winid, 6, "Focus", 0);

Note: The 'Key F1...Nop' command is necessary because of a known
feature*.  Adding new key bindings seems to require that a Recapture
take place before they take effect; binding the key to a null action
initially works around that problem by ensuring a binding already exists
when fvwm2 begins.

*The behaviour is documented in the TO-DO file, not the BUGS file.

Dear FVWM (?)

I'm working on a Linux platform, and tried the fvwm95. Unfortunatly, I 
lost all the great colors of the pullcown menus and the BrightBlue color 
of the window title.
How can I get them back (without loosing all my configuration - which 
means, just those special colors)?

Thank's

  I am trying to install version 1.24r of FVWM on a Sparc5 running
Solaris 2.4. When I try to run "make all", it complains with:

gcc: language F not recognized

Then finally bombs with 

icons.c:27: X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory

---------------------------------
 
Is the gcc warning related to the final failure? Is xpm another piece
of software which I need to install before fvwm? Perhaps someone
could refer me to an earlier posting?

Thanks

If you are new to fvwm and just wish to try it out I would suggest nabbing
fvwm-2.0.42 which is the latest 'pre-release' of fvwm 2.0 and has alot
more features, bugfixes, etc.  ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2 is
where to get it.  The fvwm homepage, http://hpc.uh.edu/fvwm (I think)
documents some known solaris buglets that are easy fixes.  Many people
(including myself) have had little problems after reading the above mentioned
fixes compiling it on solaris 2.4 or 2.5.

> gcc: language F not recognized

Solaris's cc compiler uses '-xF' and '-x04' as optimization flags.  gcc,
however, knows nothing of the command line option, and hence complains, but
it is a harmless complaint, as gcc will still compile.

> Then finally bombs with

> icons.c:27: X11/xpm.h: No such file or directory

If you don't want to have color pixmaps, just edit the configuration file
(was it Imakefile back in 1.24r?  It has been so long I forget.., in 2.xx
 it is Fvwm.tmpl)..and comment out '#define XPM' ... it is documented in
 the configuration file, then run 'MakeMakefiles'...

If you would like to have color pixmaps, then you need to grab and compile
the xpm library.  I forget if it is pointed to by the fvwm homepage, but it
is on ftp.x.org and many public ftp sites under the X11 subdirectories.

If you look at the fvwm homepage, there are searchable archives of the
mailing list at your service.

If not, can it run on another window manager ?

Openlook windows don't seem to get focus properly. 
Is this a problem with fvwm or openlook?

Specifically, workman...

I'm running linux and fvwm 42 or so.

I did it (before I installed X11R6.1) on Solaris 2.4 (Openwin 3.4) and it
worked fine. I even tried to compare the two servers in regards with speed but
I didn't really conclusive results.

If you mean another X server... I don't know. If you really mean Window
Manager, I don't know what you're talking about.

Actually, it's a feature.

By defaults, fvwm will not give input focus to a window which has set
InputHint to "false" in WM_HINTS (eg., via XSetWMProperties).  I believe
the OpenLook stuff does so unless the window has a reason to get input
focus...

You might notice, for instance, that if you click on 'CD Info' in
workman, the window that pops up gets the focus just fine.

Which begs the question, "why do you *want* workman to get input focus?"

If you *really* want all windows to get input focus, add the line
    Style "*" Lenience
to the top of your .fvwm2rc file.

See the section on "ICCCM Compliance" in the fvwm man page for the gory
details....

Hope this helps,

Apologies if this has already been reported:

Under fvwm 2.0.42, on Linux 1.2.8 and probably other platforms,
attempting to parse the following (invalid) command results in fvwm2
crashing:
    Next [

Before fvwm2 dies, it gives the error message
    [FVWM][Circulate]<<ERROR>> Conditionals require closing brace

However, in Circulate() in builtins.c where this message is generated,
the call to fvwm_msg is followed by a "return;" with no return value.

I imagine it should probably be returning NULL in this instance....

 strerror is not supported by Sunos. You will need to rewrite that
line of code to do error reporting another way. Unfortunately, I don't
remember what specifically I did to get around this or I'd give you a
patch.

Hope it helps!

Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7-jlt3

I just installed fvwm-2.0.42, having used only fvwm-1.42r before.  Here are
some suggestions.

1.  the Focus builtin leaves the cursor 2,2 pixels from the upper left
corner.  This is terribly annoying if you use FocusFollowsCursor and
you move the mouse a bit to the left after deiconifying, which is a
natural reaction if your icon is to the right of where the window pops
up.  (I use a window list to the far right, for example.)  I have
modified the code in my copy of fvwm/builtins.c to center the cursor in
the deiconified window:

    line 197-8 replace with
        x = t->frame_x + t->frame_width/2;
        y = t->frame_y + t->frame_height/2;
    line 201 replace with
        XWarpPointer(dpy, None, Scr.Root, 0, 0, 0, 0, x, y);
    lines 211-2 replace with
        XWarpPointer(dpy, None, Scr.Root, 0, 0, 0, 0, t->frame_width/2,
            t->frame_height/2);

2.  I would appreciate some new options in FvwmWinList.

    (a) FvwmWinListSort, which sorts the windows alphabetically,
    and

    (b) FvwmWinListLocal, which causes FvwmWinList to list only
    those windows on the current screen (perhaps a variant that
    only lists those windows on the current desk.  But I only use
    one desk with four screens.)

3.  There is an apparent bug in FvwmPager.  My DeskTopSize is 1x4.  If
I set FvwmPagerDeskTopScale to 18 and specify no geometry, the Pager
window is proportional to my screen, and then subdivided vertically
into 4 narrow strips.  Instead, each strip ought to be proportional to
the screen.  I work around this by using an explicit geometry.  This
bug is new in Fvwm2.

4.  There is a minor bug with icons.  I don't want them, because I use
the WinList to catalog all my windows.  So I set Style "*" NoIcon.
Nonetheless, if I invoke Focus from the WinList on a button
corresponding to an iconfied window, the icon appears (not the
deiconified window).  I would prefer for nothing at all to happen; you
can't focus on an icon that doesn't exist.

I have not subscribed to this mailing list.  I toss these suggestions
in the pot in the hopes that the designers/implementers/maintainers of
this fine product will be able to use them.

I think the problem here is that David Senouf does not know that
"openwin" is just plain X11 with the openlook windowmanager.

David, you should be able to use fvwm in your machine by setting an
appropriated "~/.xinitrc" or "~/.xsession", depending on your setup.

Hope this helps, Emilio.

I believe that the main workman window isn't accepting key events and
doesn't want keyboard focus... if you open up the cd info window
(which has input fields), it properly accepts focus.

Anybody running FVWM 2.x on Solaris 2.5?  It compiles cleanly but doesn't
run.  Specifically, it doesn't handle mouse clicks on the root window, and
doesn't put borders on the windows.

Copy the sample initialization file that comes with the distribution
to "~/.fvwm2rc". It should work.

I install fvwm2 a couple of mouths ago, but fvwm will not load for other users unless they have .fvwm2rc in their /$HOME directory. It still looks
for system.fvwmrc and not system.fvwmrc2 .

If it was correctly configured it should look for a ".fvwm2rc"
(neither "system.fvwm2rc" nor "system.fvwmrc2") in the same directory
where the modules live (setup at configuration time).

When I was building PCmcia-cs-2.8.18 against 2.0.2 i received the message

I could not find (by greping) where __FDSET_INTS was defined in the 2.0.2 dist.
It was defined in /linux-2.0.1/include/linux/posix_types.h.  I copied this file 
to the 2.0.2 distribution.

Don't know if this is legal, but it built:-)

It would have been enough to add -D__FDSET_INTS=__FDSET_LONGS to your CFLAGS, but that
will be fixed in 2.0.3.

Not true.  Open Windows 3.0 is based on X11R4 and includes other
features like PostScript.  I think Open Windows versions after 3.0 are
all based on X11R5 with several additional features.  Open Windows also
deals with fonts differently.

Using 2.0.42...

The modules.tex file claims that packets containing variable-length
names (i.e. M_WINDOW_NAME, M_ICON_NAME, M_RES_CLASS, M_RES_NAME) will be
zero-padded to fill out the last long word.

This does not appear to be the case; I am finding stray characters
attached to the end of these packets, as well as in M_ERROR and
M_CONFIG_INFO packets (which also contain variable-length names).

The fault would appear to be in SendName() in modules.c, which obtains
the memory via safemalloc() and merely does a strcpy() into it; this
fails to zero out the 'padding' bytes.

Should be trivial to fix...

(BTW, M_ICON_FILE and M_DEFAULTICON are currently undocumented in
modules.tex.)

Thanks,

Subject: FVWM: placing windows onto a particular page

Sorry if this is a faq, but I couldn't seem to find the answer in the 
mailing list archives.  Is there a way to place a window onto a particular
page within a desktop?

Right now I'm doing this by specifying a geometry option that is relative
to the upper-left corner of the virtual desktop.  However, this only works
well on workstations with the same resolution... move to a new workstation
and the windows are placed out of whack.

So if this feature isn't currently in fvwm2, I think it should be added
to the Style list.

Also, it would be nice to be able to specify the general geometry of
windows in the Style list.  Admittedly, the only program (that I use) that
lacks the -geometry option is "xosview" under Linux, and that may have changed
in the recent versions.  However, it is annoying to have to place a little 
"xload" type window by hand at startup.

So it would be nice to be able to specify what Desktop (already done), what
page, and what geometry a window class has when fvwm starts it.  You could,
of course, mix and match.  Have things start on certain desktops (but the 
current page) or on certain pages (but the current desktop).

Many apologies if I overlooked something really obvious that is already in
fvwm2.

-Dave

It is, however, sufficiently close to X11 for the purposes of this
discussion.  And the answer is Yes, fvwm does run under Sun's
implementation of X in their Open Windows Server.  And, Yes, you
just need to add the appropriate line to your .xinitrc file .


Note, however that some of the UI extensions in openwindows don't 
trasnlate very well to fvwm.  In particular the pinable windows.  But 
that is a small price to pay for a REAL window manager.

Subject: FVWM: Bug in gridded window resize generated by application
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7-jlt3

There is a bug in the interaction of Tk4.1 and fvwm2.  I am
cross-posting this note to both lists: fvwm@hpc.uh.edu and comp.lang.tcl.

When Tk resizes a window whose natural size changes, and the window has
gridding on, it may select a size that is not a multiple of the grid
size.  For example, the window may contain a frame around a text
widget.  The text widget size will be an integral multiple of grid
size, but the frame around it may increase the size by some other
amount.

When fvwm2 gets the Property Notify event (file events.c, procedure
HandlePropertyNotify(), case XA_WM_NORMAL_HINTS), it calls
ConstrainSize() to force the window to a size it considers reasonable.
Among other constraints (such as not being outside the viewable window
or smaller than a minimum), this procedure requires that gridded
windows be a multiple of the grid size.  It reduces the size to fit.
This problem did not exist in fvwm.

The result is that Tk receives an unexpected window size change, and
interprets as a user-generated size request.  Tk then changes the
policy on the window from "natural" sizing to "interactive" resizing,
which confuses further changes to window size.

The fix for this from the fvwm2 side, I think, is to remove the call to
ConstrainSize() in this case of HandlePropertyNotify().  If an
application chooses to modify its own properties, it is perhaps not the
window manager's prerogative to adjust those modifications.  I have
modified my copy of fvwm2 this way, and it seems to fix the problem
without introducing other problems.

The fix from the Tk side is to expect spurious ConfigureNotify
responses from an internally generated natural size change and to
ignore them.  However, it is difficult to distinguish such spurious
responses from legitimate user-initiated size changes.  I don't know
how to insert such a fix.

I do not belong to the fvwm mailing list, nor do I generally read the Tcl
newsgroup, so I would appreciate direct responses by e-mail.

I have found a difference in behaviour between fvwm 2.0.42 and other
window managers (such as mwm and HP VUE) - I'm not sure if its a bug
or a feature!

The behaviour:

I have an application, using Motif, that starts up a dialog shell.  It
attempts to position the shell at the same location as the application's
main shell by obtaining XmNx and XmNy for the main shell (using
XtVaGetValues) and setting them to the same value for the dialog shell
(usuing XtVaSetValues).  Under mwm this results in the top LH corners of
the window borders to be aligned exactly (as you might expect), with the
top left corner of the window manager frame at the requested co-ordinates.

Under fvwm, the top left corner of the dialog shell (not its window manager
frame) is placed at the requested co-ordinates, so that once the border
is added it is offset up and left from the main window.

This behaviour seems to be caused by the function HandleConfigureRequest,
in events.c, in particular around lines 1286-1289 where x and y are set
as follows:
  if (cre->value_mask & CWX)
    x = cre->x - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->bw;
  if (cre->value_mask & CWY) 
    y = cre->y - Tmp_win->boundary_width - Tmp_win->title_height - Tmp_win->bw;

If I explicitly change this code so that:
  x = cre->x;
  y = cre->y;
the window gets placed where I expect.

Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this behaviour a bug?

Thanks for any pointers,

Howdy all.

Ok, I'm back from vacation (none too happy about that, I might add - I
need a vacation to rest up from my vacation) and I finally finished up
beta 2.0.43.  It's now at ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/fvwm/version-2/ and
here's what it looks like:

  -rw-rw-r--   1 chines   fvwm      548968 Jul  8 13:23 fvwm-2.0.43.tar.gz

And here's the rather sizeable ChangeLog entry:

2.0.43
       1. More man page updates & Imake fixes
       2. Simple patch to help take care of some timing bugs
       3. Patch to fix resize oddities when hitting 'hard' edge introduced
          by EdgeScroll loop patch
       4. Fixed startup w/ no rc bug, plus added more defaults, so if
          started without an rc file, things should run ok.  Plus it now
          outputs error messages if Read fails, then tries to Read
          system.fvwm2rc (after first read fails).
       5. Patch to fix UseStyle problem w/ BackColor
       6. More FAQ updates
       7. Created an 'extras' dir, and moved some of the existing modules
          in there (the ones that aren't being built by default).
       8. More potential speedups in event processing
       9.  Decoupled warp from Focus, adding WarpToWindow function.
       10. Added SendToModule builtin to send arbitrary strings to modules
           to help implement more complex dynamic module abilities and
           allow for module to module communication
       11. Put old FvwmButtons back as FvwmGoodStuff, for people who
           prefer the simpler older version (in extras dir).  Also made it
           able to be passed in the name parameter on invocation so it
           doesn't have to be symbolically linked to the new names any
           more.
       12. Adding a new module FvwmForm2 in the extras directory,
           contributed by Frederic Cordier.  Based on FvwmForm but
           completely rewritten apparently.  It uses scripts, has a new
           more complex syntax (Pascal like) and adds RadioButtons.  I
           would like to eventually combine aspects of the two versions
           (and more) to make one killer module, perhaps.
       13. Made fvwm_msg send errors to modules, so FvwmTalk sees them
           like it used to (and any other module that looks for M_ERROR
           in the future)
       14. Added DestroyModuleConfig, based on patch from Toshi Isogai
       15. Modules can now send module config commands to fvwm (eg FvwmTalk)
       16. Removed implicit Exec exec stuff for the time being, until I
           come up with a better way to do it (back to old behavior)
       17. More mini icons added and some icons removed
       18. Added "KillMe" command that modules can send to fvwm asking for
           an assisted suicide (almost called this Kevorkian :)).  Mark
           Crimmins wanted this for probs with TkGoodStuff.
       19. Fixed RaiseWindow bug under some servers when no icon pixmap.
       20. Fixed one prob w/ FvwmAuto and menus being hidden (under click
           to focus - still needs work for other focus policies, but not
           entirely sure how to approach this yet).
       21. Added ExitFunction, to be executed on exit (before restarts too).
           Useful for explicitly killing modules, etc.
       22. Changed behavior of '-f' to just specify config file (now use
           -cmd to perform an actual command, like -cmd 'FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc')
       23. Updates to FvwmSaveDesk from Carsten Paeth so it should now
           actually work under 2.xx, plus some other bugfixes too I
           believe.
       24. Added PipeRead function, which executes a program and Read's
           it's output.  Useful for making dynamic menus and such.
       25. Security fix for FvwmM4 & FvwmCpp from Austin Donnelly
       26. Added strerror for SunOS 4.1.x
       27. Added ability to remove mouse and key bindings without restart
           (do the binding but specify '-' as the function).  Probably
           needs more checking for removing mouse bindings from title bar
           buttons correctly, though.
       28. Updates to FvwmIconMan from Brady Montz.
       29. Updates to FvwmIconBox from Nobutaka Suzuki.
       30. Patch from Austin Donnelly for multi-keypress required for
           WindowList problem.
       31. Patch to center text on left pixmaps in menus.
       32. Patch to allow menus to pop up left if not enough room on right
           (currently in ifdef -> define LEFT_MENUS to enable when compiling).

Oh, and I forgot to update fvwm2.man to go with #22, which of course I
didn't notice until after I had uploaded the tar file.  Obviously not
vital so I put this patch for it in the LATEST_NEWS section of the WWW
docs:

I'd like to make this the last beta before the first official release
(2.1.0).  So let me know what other problems you find with it so I can
clean it up (especially build and doc problems).  Bear in mind that I
can't fix ALL of it's bugs, especially the one's I can't reproduce...

Hopefully 2.1.0 will be out in just a few weeks, and then I can begin
with the long awaited semi mythical Great Style Flag Rewrite, which I
know many people are awaiting with baited breath...

ps - I'm still wading through all of the email I got while I was gone,

I am using Fvwm 1.24 with SunOS 4.1.3.

Is it possible to bind different menus to different workspaces (pages)?
I would like to make a different menu popup depending on which workspace I am
 on.
This would make the menus "cleaner", I only want certain items to appear if I am
 workspace 1, different items for 2, etc.


Here are the options that I know of:
 
##############################################################################
#        Mouse Bindings
##############################################################################
 
#Button: 0= any    1=left   2=middle   3=right
#Context: R= root window    1-9= title bar buttons   F=frame  S=size(corner)
#            T=title(top)    I=icon
#Modifier: A= any shift/control key combination
 
 
#     Button    Context Modifi  Function
Mouse 1         R       A       PopUp "Utils-menu"
Mouse 2         R       A       PopUp "WinOp-menu"
Mouse 3         R       A       PopUp "Main-menu"




Please cc me an email with your response.  I don't read the list
because most of the recent discussions were regarding Fvwm2, which we
don't have.

Thanks,
Kevin

Just to say thanks for the new version.  I just installed it this
morning with no trouble on Sunos 4.1.4 and X11R6.

I haven't had time to make the most of all the latest stuff,
except FvwmIconMan's new action syntax (which seems very good).

It's looking great....

Cheers, Jens

I was wondering if there is a way to get an icon to stay in one place.
When I log in I start up a number of iconified xterms on the servers
in my department.  If I deiconify the two icons (A, B) at the top of
the stack and the reiconify them (B, A) they will switch positions with
B above A.  Is there a way to have fvwm2 remember where the icon was
originally and put it back in the same place?

Thanks,
Dan Ehrlich

Here's a patch which updates FvwmAudio to work with the new module
message M_STRING and fixes a problem with M_ERROR, rplay, and Solaris.
(Solaris also defines M_ERROR in one if its headers)

Please update the distribution with this patch.  Thanks.

The enclosed patch changes fvwm's placement of transient windows which do
*not* have any PPosition.

With this patch, transient windows (i.e. popups) which have no location
specified have RandomPlacement forced on. SmartPlacement, if specified in
the window flags, will take precedence.

Prior to this, any transient with no location specified would be placed in
the upper left corner.

I made this change so our application wouldn't have to, in effect, duplicate
RandomPlacement code.

Note, however, that neither mwm (Motif) nor twm do this; they both put the
window at (0,0). I haven't checked other window managers.

It may be desirable to delay this until after the Great Style Flags Rewrite
so that this behavior can be controlled on a per-window basis, just like the
other placement options.

The enclosed patch enhances compatiblity of FvwmButtons with the old version.

The old version (at some point in its life) had a SwallowModule option. If
this is supplied to the new version, it gets confused. This patch simply
strips out the 'Module' suffix to the option; things work fine then.

	I wasn't sure wether to cc this to the other fvwm
	lists but ...

	First, I'd like to thank all who helped continue 
	develop fvwm. Second, I have an odd idea/request
	pertaining to the ftp site. I know there are fvwm
	alternatives like bowman (NeXT Step clone) and
	fvwm95 (Windows 95 clone) which are kinda "cute".
	I thought it'd be kinda useful/appropriate/kewl
	to see the family of "feeble" window managers in
	the same site.

	Just a thought,
	-Hank

Here is an my FlipFocus patch updated for fvwm 2.0.43.  For those of
of you who are new, FlipFocus swaps the top two (selected) windows.
This lets you switch back and forth between frequently used windows without
having to remember if you need to use Prev or Next.

The arguments to FlipFocus are the same as to Focus.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7-jlt3


Here is my CurrentScreen patch for fvwm 2.0.43.  This patch makes CurrentScreen
(in the Next/Prev commands) work more intuitive.

Before this patch, CurrentDesk selects windows on the current desk, and
CurrentScreen selects window on the current page.  To select only windows
on the current screen (view port), both CurrentDesk and CurrentScreen must
be specified.

After the patch:

	CurrentDesk	selects windows on the current virtual desk
	CurrentPage	selects windows on the current virtual page
	CurrentScreen	selects windows on the current screen, or view port.

I apply it after the FlipFocus patch, but the FlipFocus patch is not
necessary.

Most likely this will make it into 2.1.0.  Although I didn't want to
put anything new in there, this is pretty harmless so I'll probably
put it in.

probably a Linux-specific and gcc-specific issue, don't know where else 
to look. after compiling the new fvwm I get seg fault when it runs. I 
suspect the optimization of gcc. Where can I add gcc specific options in 
the Imakefile?

another issue: Can I expect FvwmTaskBar from fvwm95-2 to be compatible 
with this version?

Actually, I don't think the distinction between Page and Screen is
necessary.  I do think that CurrentScreen should be renamed to be
CurrentPage to match the semantics of Page and Desk in fvwm and Screen
in X11 (although I'd probably keep CurrentScreen around as an
undocumented synonym so as to not blow existing users out of the
water), and that it should always refer to just the visible page (and
not the same page on different desks) as that is really what makes the
most sense.  If the ability to select things on the same page in
different desks is truly needed, I think that should be called
SamePage.

The way CurrentScreen works now is it selects windows on the current page,
on any desk.  The patch changes CurrentScreen so that is always refers
to just the visible page (and not the same page on different desks).
The patch adds CurrentPage to maintain the functionality of the old
CurrentScreen.

I think it is usefull to be able to specify any window on the current desk,
and window on the current page (any desk), and windows only on the 
currently visible page.  What does everyone else think?

If all three specifications are available, what are the most intuitive
names for them?  My vote is for CurrentDesk, CurrentPage, and CurrentScreen.
I would like to hear what other people think.

Hi,

I just download the latest fvwm 2.0.43 and now I am having problems
with tkGoodStuff.  The grab feature I use to embed perfmeter no longer
grabs the X Window for perfmeter.  The perfmeter shows up in its own
window now.

Also, I have lost the email address for the tkGoodStuff list.  Could
someone
please send it to me.

Thanks

Well, I just added your patch to 2.1.0, slightly modified to match
what I thought made the most sense:

  CurrentDesk - As expected
  CurrentPage - This page, this desk
  SamePage    - Same page XY, but any desk

and I left CurrentScreen as a synonym for SamePage (current behavior)
but I plan to remove CurrentScreen from the man page.  But perhaps a
better name for SamePage would be CurrentPageAnyDesk?  It may be long,
but I like explict names like that, so I think I'll change it to that
(CurrentPageAnyDesk) if no one comes up with a better one.

Having CurrentPage and SamePage could be confusing.  Having CurrentPage
and CurrentPageAnyDesk makes it fairly clear what each one does.

I think CurrentPageAnyDesk is a good name.  It is long, but it will 
probably not be used that often.

Here is the patch with the new names so people will not have to wait
until 2.1.0 comes out.

OK Chuck! 

   I compiled 43 on Linux. Clean out of the box (only FvwmConsole
does not work). And the Good News are that it seems that the nasty 
race condition bugs (menu disappearing and cursor stick to the "bullet" 
state) are gone. Well, I have not tested it under stress, but fdesign 
from xform (that triggered the bug almost everytime) now works like
a charm.

   Goooooood! 

   Bye,
         Romano.

Hmm. Maybe late responce...

chuck_hines>   CurrentDesk - As expected
chuck_hines>   CurrentPage - This page, this desk
chuck_hines>   SamePage    - Same page XY, but any desk

Why not getting more simple way:

CurrentDesk - to specify 'current desk', as expected.
		(ofcourse, do not consider page)
CurrentPage - to specify 'current page', as expected.
		(ofcourse, do not consider desk)

Is it not enough ? There are only TWO dimension, Desk and Page, but
why we need THREE flags ?

If my knowledge about Next/Prev/None implementation is right, and THIS
MY 'CurrentPage/CurrentDesk' DESIGN PROPOSAL is implemented, we can say

	Next [CurrentDesk,CurrentPage] whatever

to specify "search window which is in current desk and is in current
page, and if found, execute whatever (maybe user-defined function)".

I think it's very simple and strong, isn't it ? Or my misunderstanding ?

Let me chime in here.. I compiled it under linux, and made some RPMs of it
which I've uploaded to ftp.redhat.com. No problems at all, except
fvwmconsole.

I hope that bug that made the cursor stay a bullet is gone for good!

Which is why I made that 'extras' directory.  I have to think more
about how to properly build & install FvwmConsole.  Plus the current
version doesn't work on some platforms, I believe.  When those are
solved I'll move it back into the modules directory.

As a side note, Toshi has a newer version for me that works better and
on more (all?)  platforms, but he no longer is at that same email
address and has limited access so I haven't heard back from him yet.
I hope to get that newer verson in 2.1.0.

Yup, that problem is "fixed" (thanks to a change that Rob suggested
that I had forgotten about but luckily someone else on the list,
having difficulties remembering who right now, reminded me of).  I
have "fixed" in quotes because I'm not overly crazy about the fix, but
it'll work for now and I'll investigate different solutions later as I
can.

And speaking of race condition bugs, I think I'll have the problem w/
some windows that were started in the .xinitrc before fvwm not getting
style conditions at startup that some people see solved for 2.1.0.  I
know what the problem is, I just have to figure out the best way to
attack it without breaking anything else (and I think I have an
acceptable, safe solution in mind right now).  I may post a patch for
it early for people to test.

RG>    Goooooood!

Does my heart good to hear reports like this...  :)

Later,
Chuck

The only problem I found with your RPM was that the audio doesn't work
correctly along with fvwmconsole. On 42 there was a patch to fix this
audio problem.

I don't use fvwmaudio, and I only did minimal testing on the rpm before I
put it out. I've been off the fvwm mailing list for a while, and I think I
missed that patch. Could someone send it to me?

One of the most likely reasons it doesn't work is that it is
running wildly off the end of a malloc'd array (by about two
elements), and thus stomping memory.

There are also some initializers that are illegal (but presumably
accepted by gcc).

With those two problems fixed, it ran fine on Solaris 2.4 (with
Sun's compiler, not gcc).

I can send the patches if anyone is interested.

Most certainly anyone who uses FvwmIconMan will notice that the version 
included with fvwm2.0.43 doesn't work with their old .fvwm2rc files. Also,
I was negligent and didn't make FvwmIconMan print out in big capital letters
to read the man page if it detects the old style .fvwm2rc lines, so I'm 
suggesting this to everybody affected now.

Basically, the syntax and sematics of actions changed. 

There also is a bug that I introduced that I fixed the same day 2.0.43 was
released, so please don't send me any bug reports about it. It occurs when
you use key commands to move the selected button to the manager which is 
not the one the mouse is in, and then you move the mouse out of the manager.
The consistent thing would be for the selected button to become unselected,
but it doesn't. Then, if you move the mouse back into the manager, you 
can find yourself with two selected buttons. I know that there are few things
sadder than seeing a computer program get confused, but such is life.

Here's a pretty small wish for FVWM:

Some kind of option to the 'Move' command that would move a window to a
specified location relative to the X or Y axis (rather than both).

For example:

AddToFunc	"MaximizeVert"
+	"I"	Maximize 0 94
+	"I"	Move -1 28p

I'd like to bind this to a double-click on the title bar, which will, in
effect, maximize the current window vertically (94%, anyway), and then
position the resulting window at X=<current_pos> and Y=28.  (The
negative position would mean current position.)

I'm trying to get around a current limitation of the 'Maximize'
function;  'Maximize 0 94' will move the window to the position
(<current_xpos>, 0).  This is all well and good, but I personally don't
want this behavior, since I have a button bar which is Sticky and
StaysOnTop, which rides the entire top of the screen for 26 pixels. 
Moving a window to (0, <current_ypos>) will make the title bar
inaccessible.

I created the "MaximizeVert" function to perform the Maximize in the
vertical direction, and then move the window underneath the button bar. 
However, the "Move" function requires absolute coordinates.

My current workaround is to use the values '28p 28p' for the 'Move'
function.  This makes the window "jump" in two directions (and I don't
really want that behavior).  I'd just like some way to move a window
relative to its current position in one direction; using a negative
number seems like a safe enough "overload."

Does anybody else have any other suggestions?  I know that there are
hundreds of functions within fvwm2, and that I may be overlooking
something.  I would MUCH PREFER a way to get the desired behavior
without requiring a change to fvwm.

I'm running fvwm 2.0.43, I think 2.0.42 also has this little bug in it:

If I start up FvwmTalk, and type in something like: "Module foo", (or any
module that doesn't exist) it gives me a weird error message:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2 foo
                                                                        ^
                                                                        |
                                                                   no "/" here

right after the "foo" is a character I don't recognize, it looks sort
of like a 'U' sitting on top of a 'T':

	U
	T

I've also seen the same slightly messed-up error message when I mispelled
a module name in the fvwmrc. It's just a little confusing the 1st time you
see it..

Hi,

I tried to compile Fvwm 2.0.43 under my Red Hat 3.0.3 linux running on an Dec
Alpha Cabriolet (kernel 2.0.4) without success.

I had to remove the KLUDGE_LIBS = -ldnet_stub (I don't have a libdnet_stub.a)
in Fvwm.tmpl and also remove the two prototypes for bzero and gethostname in
fvwm/alpha_header.h and it then compiled and it seems to run ok.

Any comment on this?

HP-UX 10.01 and wonder if anyone knows what this error means. It
compiled fine thru the library module...I only added the line:

to the Imakefile for HP's compiler.

making all in ./fvwm...

No, but the result of memory corruption is unpredictable. It may be that
something (malloc heap management?) gets into a tight loop with this
corruption on your system.

I just got a SIGSEGV in malloc.

There is a coredump inducing bug in the FvwmIconMan released with
fvwm2.0.43, so I'm releasing another one. 

You can get it from:
ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub/FvwmIconMan/FvwmIconMan-0.6.tar.gz

To install, drop it into the modules directory of the fvwm distribution
(remove the old FvwmIconMan directory first!) and go from there.

Sorry for the trouble.

This is a known bug/shortcoming in fvwm that's been there for a long time.
Apparently it doesn't deal with OpenWindows hints very well...

The problem stems from the -WP switch, which is telling cm where to place
its icon.  When you restart fvwm, the icon is placed at 0,0 before it "zaps"
to the location you specify with -WP.  If there's another window at 0,0, the
icon will hide under that window and will stay there until it's exposed, at
which time it will "zap" to the proper location.

I worked around the problem by eliminating the "-WP" switch from the command
line and creating an IconBox for "cm" in the location that you want and that's
barely big enough to hold the icon.  This way fvwm places the icon itself
and doesn't have to rely on the OpenWindows hints from cm...

I know you will probable receive several responses, and here's one.

I've had this problem with fvwm2 since converting over to version 2.0.38, and
its followed with each release.  Any Sun application I started with a "Style"
of NoIconTitle and gave it an icon position via the "-WP X Y" would start in
the upper lefthand corner (position 0 0).  This happens to be where I place my
contool.  Consequently, that application would be hidden under my contool.

To get around this I removed the icon position and gave it a "Style" with an
IconBox.

While I think that this is not a nice solution, I've also found that this
problem isn't a real big concern (or should I say a high priority) for the
developers of fvwm.  They have bigger fish to fry.

I think fvwm is the best window manager out there right now, so I can learn to
live with a little irritant like this. IMHO of course.

I had segmentation fault with the new fvwm2. It was a 
mismatch between the headers of libxpm and libxpm itself. A libxpm 
reinstallation solved it. 
Thought I 
write this if anyone is interested since it was *not* fvwm2's fault.....
Please keep up the good work.....

Hi,

I had been trying to compile fvwm95-2.0.42a and fvwm-2.0.43, and cannot 
do so without getting the following error messages:

/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `<file>'

..where <file> is `XFreeGc', `XSync', `XGetGeometry', etc..

These messages appear when compiling (I believe) all the fvwm modules 
(FvwmTalk, FvwmButtonBar, etc..).  I have libXpm.so.4.6 installed, and I 
believe it is the ELF version.

Any ideas? 

Thanks,

Try applying this patch that Graham Barr posted for a variant of this

I have been using fvwm on my Linux-PC for a long time. Since I am very happy
with fvwm Version 2.0 under Linux, I would bee glad to use it on my Sun
Workstation at work under Solaris.

Since I am not very experienced in compiling software-packets, I would like to
ftp a compiled version of fvwm V2.0 for Solaris from someone.

Is this possible? Thank you in advance,

Ok.. you can hit me with something hard and heavy now :-/

Downloaded and compiled fvwm about an hour ago. Fired it up, and..
the mouse didn't work :-( .. so, I spent about an hour looking through
mailinglist archives, recompiling, scanning through man pages until
finally figuring out that all I had to do was
mv ~/.fvwmrc ~/.fvwm2rc # ...

Not being able to move windows around & stuff when fvwm can't find it's
.rc strikes me as unexpected behavior.

Anyway, now that I can finally use fvwm, it's great ! Thanks to all you
guys who've put your efforts into it !

Ciao,

Howdy,

  When I try to compile fvwm-2.0.43, I get 
Makefile:683: *** missing separator.  Stop.

If I look at line 683 I see:

    679 tags::
    680          $(TAGS) -w *.[ch]
    681          $(TAGS) -xw *.[ch] > TAGS

    687
    688 install::
    689          @case '${MFLAGS}' in *[ik]*) set +e;; esac; \
    690

If I try to comment this out, then I get 

make Makefiles
Makefile:798: *** missing separator.  Stop.   

    791          do \
    792          (cd $$i ; echo including "in $(CURRENT_DIR)/$$i..."; \
    793          $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)  includes); \
    794          done
    795
    796 # -------------------------------------------------
    797 # dependencies generated by makedepend
    798 IncludeMakefile(Makefile.dep)
    799

commenting out this gives me many missing separator messages all over
the place.

I am using Linux kernel 2.0.6 with XFree86 3.1.2E.


Any suggestions?

 Missing separator means that a tab got converted to spaces, probably
in the Imakefile.

target: <tab> dependancy
<tab>	commandline	@\\
<tab>	commandline	@\\

not

target: <spaces> dependancy
<spaces> commandline @\\
<spaces> commandline @\\


 Convert the spaces back to tabs and it should work again.

Since they are separate projects, hrm, ask the hpc maintainer I guess...

Personally I hope someday that the features of fvwm95 and bowman will work
their way into fvwm as either compile-time or style-flag choices.  IMHO,
though.

I'm not too keen on the idea.  It slightly irks me that fvwm95 was split
off; why could not the effort be invested to get fvwm to the point where it
could do what fvwm95 does instead of just taking off in an incompatible
direction?

As for Bowman, is it still being developed?

I think that would be the the ideal goal.

I don't know if anybody else has seen this. It happens on both Linux 2.0.6
(x86) and Solaris 2.5 (sparc). FVWM 2.0.43 compiles fine on both platforms
but when I try to run it with

fvwm -f "FvwmM4 $HOME/.fvwmrc" > $HOME/.xinitlog 2>&1

and here is what I get in my .xinitlog (on Linux, similar on Solaris):

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm ELF
[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> No such module /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm

Any idea? Thanks.

Thanks for the response,

   I figured out the problem...

About a week ago, I upgraded my Motif to Red Hat Motif 2.0.
During the install, Red Hat overwrote several of the files
in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config, particularly

Imake.rules
Project.tmpl
linux.cf
site.def

By putting these back to the originals, I was able to 
compile with no problems.  I am running XFree86 3.1.2E
which is X11R6.1.  I suspect that imake may be slightly 
incompatible with previous versions, thus the motif changes
(dated Jan and Mar 1995) did not work.  Have contacted
Red Hat.

Thanks...

Joel

[FVWM][main]:  Fvwm Version 2.0.43 compiled on Jul 14 1996 at 15:00:03
Linux LightHouse 2.0.6 #11 Sun Jul 14 14:31:13 CDT 1996 i586

A small suggestion, though:

The 'Dir' #defines would be helped, imho, if the following were used:

/***************************************************************************
 * The following line only needs to be uncommented if you do not want
 * Imake's default behavior.
 * Uncomment and edit to suit your requirements.
 ***************************************************************************/
/* #define FvwmPREFIX /usr/local/X11R6 */

#ifdef FvwmPREFIX
/* Where do you want the fvwm binaries installed */
#define FvwmBinDir FvwmPREFIX/bin

/* Where do you want the fvwm modules installed. */
#ifdef RenameFVWM2
#define FvwmDir FvwmPREFIX/lib/X11/fvwm2
#else
#define FvwmDir FvwmPREFIX/lib/X11/fvwm
#endif

/* Where do you want the fvwm libraries installed. */
#define FvwmLibDir FvwmPREFIX/lib

/* Where do you want the fvwm man pages installed */
#define FvwmManPath FvwmPREFIX/man
#define FvwmManSuffix 1

#endif /* FvwmPREFIX */

Notice this changes nothing from the current behavior (except correctly
handle the case if I don't rename fvwm to fvwm2 <grin>)...but does make
it considerably easier to change the default location...

My purpose in suggesting the above is threefold:

1) single line uncomment vs 5
2) singe line edit (in most cases) vs 5
3) get people used to the idea of a 'prefix', for easy introduction to
   autoconf's '--prefix=' command line option.

Comments?

It's trying to read 'FvwmM4' as though it were a config file, rather
than running it as a module.  It was changed in the last patchlevel.

Try using '-cmd' instead of '-f' on your fvwm command line.

First I have a question and then I'll get on with the bug report.

It's not in the FAQ so - what exactly is the purpose of libfvwm2.a?
Is it only for those who wish to write modules or what?

Background info: 
I'm running Digital UNIX 3.2c on an AlphaStation and 3.0 on a DEC
3000/300LX Alpha.  Both systems have X11R5 and the XPM libs.  Fvwm was
compiled "out of the box" with xmkmf;make Makefiles;make;make install;
make install.man - all I changed in Fvwm.tmpl were the destination
directories for the install.

Bug 1:

This had appeared on the DEC 3000 since 2.0.42 but didn't show up on
the AlphaStation 'til 2.0.43.  Often, edgescroll won't work.  I'll
drag and drag and it won't switch pages.  If I then hit Control-right,
it works fine, and thereafter edgescroll works normally.  I'm not sure
if the problem stays fixed 'til I next log out and back in again
though.  The relevant lines from my .fvwm2rc file are:

EdgeScroll              100 100
EdgeResistance          200 25

Key Left        A       C       Scroll -100 0
Key Right       A       C       Scroll +100 +0
Key Up          A       C       Scroll +0   -100
Key Down        A       C       Scroll +0   +100


Bug 2:

xlock -mode flame has started dying after a few minutes of running.
The error is:

	/bin/sh: 1416 Floating exception 

where the number is the PID of:

	/bin/sh -c xlock -nolock -mode flame

Previously the only mode I'd ever had trouble with was "galaxy".  I
don't know which of the last few versions this might have appeared in
because I don't run XLock that often.  I can't really say for certain
that it's fvwm but I haven't changed anything else that would affect
it.

The line in my .fvwm2rc is:

+                       "flame"         Exec xlock -nolock -mode flame

I haven't tried this on the AlphaStation though.


Bug 3:

The bug I mentioned in another message in which one of my xterms
wasn't getting the Styles hasn't been fixed and may be worse.  I'm not
sure it was supposed to have been fixed but "Simple patch to help take
care of some timing bugs" might be referring to it.  To reiterate, the
first xterm I run in my .xsession often, especially on the slower
machine, does not get any Styles (not *, not xterm, nothing) even
though the other xterms (also run from the .xsession after a short
"sleep" delay...probably not starting until after fvwm2 is already
running) do get the Styles.  Restarting fvwm2 fixes this problem but,
if I do it before some of the other delayed jobs in the .xsession
finish, some of them will never finish and I end up with no xclock or
xpostit+ or something.

The reason I say this may be worse is that it's now happening more
often on the AlphaStation, which is faster and hardly ever needs to
swap.  In 2.0.42, it usually happened on the slower, lower RAM,
machine and only occasionally on the fast machine.


Request for 2.1.0:

Not a bug report and I know the TO-DO list mentions resurrecting
StubbornPlacement but, in case it's not implicitly grouped with
StubbornPlacement, the return of StubbornIconPlacement would also be
very nice - especially the feature that caused icons to reposition
themselves to avoid windows when the Scroll function was called.  I
had gotten used to not having to search for icons under windows.

Thanks much,

  The name of bowman has changed. It's now called AfterStep:

http://mango.sfasu.edu/~frank/afterstep/
and it's still under developpement (last release 96/06/21).

  As far as I can see (and I don't see much), the differences between
AfterStep and Fvwm2 are the icons' pixmaps handling, FvwmButtons/Warf
and the Menu drawings. There used to be a difference with the titlebar
buttons, but since fvwm2.0.42 the nextstep buttons look can be
emulated.

  All these differences are look and feel diff. (I didn't read the
code). Except for the Menu drawings, I think the AfterStep can be
emulated: just add a background to the icons...
  Just a small question for FvwmButtons: Is it possible to (totally)
fill an fvwmButtons entry with a pixmap? (it seems to add at least the
borders).

Fvwm95:
  The main difference with Fvwm2 is the left titlebar button
pixmap. In fvwm95 you can have a button pixmap for each application. I
think that most of the other diff are based on this one (FvwmWinList,
Taskbar...).
  This could be solved by adding a
Style "foo"      ButtonIcon Xterm.xpm
option but I dont think it is a priority for Chuck (at least not
before the 2.1.0).

  As you can see these are *visual* diff. Can anybody add some other
to this list?

Lokh.

Here is a little patch for 2.0.43, to fix:

* the manual of FvwmForm (maybe typo)
* FvwmIconMan which uses sysconf() (Use GetFdWidth() instead)

I use version 0.6 of FvwmIconMan to make this.

Not to mention the entire boarder around anything is continuous instead 
of the mwm 'chop at the corners' look.  Plus with fvwm the 'not-possible'
menu options (such as close on xdaliclock) ends up sunken instead of simply
another color.  There are alot of visual differences, actually.

Also, I don't know if it is still different or not, but at one time or
another, fvwm95 required some menu-placement changes.

Somehow your DISPLAY env var is getting set wrong.  Chances are you
aren't letting startx or xinit set it correctly for you, but trying to
set it yourself in one of your shell startup scripts.

Me neither.  They are seperate projects, even though they were started
with fvwm, and we really have nothing to do with them otherwise, so
why should we have them at the same site?  (after all by that same
token shouldn't they all be with the twm code, since that is where
fvwm got it's start from?)

We all know why fvwm95 came about - because of my feelings that I
don't think all the stuff put in fvwm95 belongs fvwm, although some of
the features may appear eventually.

But I really don't want to get into that whole discussion again...
I'll just say that the only thing that really bugs me about fvwm95 is
the choice of leaving the 'fvwm' in the name and that people email me
(and the fvwm lists) with questions about it.

TTF> IMHO, though.

Jason> I think that would be the the ideal goal.

Some features will probably appear as style flag choices and the like,
but I'd prefer to stay away from compile time stuff.

Also, I'd like to try making it possible to do more stuff in modules
that could alter the apperance (menus drawn by modules are certainly
easily possible now) or perhaps through dynamic loading (which would
probably be better for this but a little less portable), but honestly
it's not a high priority for me.

Just out of curiousity, is everyone else who is seeing it running on

Actually, I think this is a bug with xlock.  Do you see the same

xlock in various modes core dumping (or locking up the machine

investigate yet.

The "Simple patch..." does not address this problem.  As I said in a
note a few days ago (I believe), I know what is causing this problem
and have a good idea how to fix it.

In a nutshell, fvwm isn't Grabbing the server soon enough and new
windows are popping up after the list of windows to traverse has been
made (which is why they don't get updated).  The least destructive fix
that I can think of is to move the initial XGrabServer call up a
little, but some of the functions that are called below it make calls
to XGrabServer and XUngrabServer, which don't keep track of the total
grab request count (ie the first XUngrabServer could mess things up
again), so I'm creating my own wrappers around XGrab/UngrabServer to
keep track of the count and only ungrab after all corresponding grabs
& ungrabs are done which should fix the problem.  It'll be in 2.1.0,
although I may mail out a patch for people to try early.

Dan> Request for 2.1.0:

Dan> Not a bug report and I know the TO-DO list mentions resurrecting

Dan> had gotten used to not having to search for icons under windows.

Neither of them will be in 2.1.0, but I have had the latter in mind
for part of the "better icon handling needed?" entry.

  I saw in the CHANGES file of FvwmButtons that there was an IconBack
resource (to use a background pixmap in FvwmButtons), but I cna't make
it work.

  Since the author mention a disk crash I was wondering if this
feature was *really* implemented (implemented, destroyed and not
re-implemented)?

No, I'm running linux on a pentium, and I get the same bug. I have to
click on a different virtual desktop on the pager, and then edgescroll
starts working again, and seems to keep working until I restart fvwm.
I've had this problem in 2.0.42 and .43.

Ditto. Have this problem under sundry kernels of Linux and HP-UX. 2.0.42
and 43. If you need to check out an fvwm2rc to duplicate this, check out"

	Using this .fvwm2rc file I was able to duplicate this error. It
does NOT happen with my .fvwm2rc file. I'm currently eliminating things
to see if I can narrow down what causes the error.
	While doing all this I thought I'd mention some things I noticed:
there is an error in the fvwm2 man page: "fvwm2 -f" is now "fvwm2 -cmd" and
the man page should reflect that. :) Also, I like how the failsafe mode 
works now. You get one menu with quit on it. Perhaps it should pop up a
menu box and say that the .fvwm2rc file was not found?
	Ok... after playing around for about a half hour, I think I have
an idea about what is going wrong. I suspect that everyone who encouters 
this problem uses FvwmCpp. 
	When I got the above listed .fvwm2rc file I had to switch to 
starting Fvwm with FvwmCpp. As soon as I did that, I was unable to switch
virtual screens. I winnowed away at the .fvwmrc file until I had only this:
In my .xsession: exec fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp /home/staff/eburke/.fvwm2rc"
----------------cut--------------------------
ModulePath /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/
HilightColor            linen SteelBlue4
AddToFunc "InitFunction"
+       "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
AddToFunc "RestartFunction"
+       "I" Module FvwmPager 0 0
AddToMenu "Utilities" "Utilities" Title
+       "Exit Fvwm" Popup Quit-Verify
AddToMenu "Quit-Verify" "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
+       "Yes, Really Quit" Quit
+       "Restart fvwm" Restart fvwm2
Mouse 1         R       A       Menu Utilities Nop
----------------cut--------------------------
	The shortest possible fvwm2rc file that doesn't fail. And each time
I restarted I still had trouble. Then, switching my startup back so that it
does NOT use FvwmCPP caused the problem to vanish.
	I would have tried running my normal .fvwm2rc through FvwmCpp as a
backup test, but it barfs on it for some reason and gives me the failsafe.

	So this doesn't exactly solve the problem but it should help
pinpoint it somewhat. Anyone care to tell us if FvwmM4 has a similar
problem?

I've read the man pages and examined the sample file but I can't seem
to make this work:

I'd like to do two things upon button press: switch to another page
and then do an exec of gnudoit. I figured I'd use Action under options
and then the regular stuff. The config line looks like this:

*FvwmButtons(Action "GoToPage 1 0") Get_Mail mail.xbm exec gnudoit \
"(vm-get-new-mail)"

The gnudoit happens, but the GoToPage does not. Would someone mind
explaining Actions and how to do more than one thing with a button
push.

Thanks in advance,

Yes, it does. At least, I experience this problem, and I use FvwmM4.

Actually the default is not to install it - which I had been following
blindly since I didn't know what it was.

Yes.

I had too, but as I said, only with galaxy mode and never this quickly
- also I don't think it was the same error.  I haven't updated xlock
in over a year so if this new error is caused a bug in xlock, then
somehow it wasn't triggered by 1.24r.

[snip]

One more thing, which I think I posted a long time ago but isn't in
BUGS or TO-DO, is that when I do something that closes a window (hit
return in a dialog box, click on a close or cancel button, whatever),
often the window manager gets "stuck" with the filled-circle cursor
and nothing responds (keystrokes, edgescroll, whatever) until I click
somewhere to "unstick" it.

I'll second that.

Just to add a detail, edgescroll *never* works right after I log in,
even if I restart fvwm.  But as soon as I hit a key combination that
calls Scroll, it starts working and, as far as I can tell, seems to
continue working.  As a counterpoint, and this was the case with 1.24r
as well, calling Scroll with a key combination often stops working
after quitting Netscape, but will start working again after I use the
mouse to edgescroll.  I presume it's a keymapping bug with Netscape
but I mention here in case there's an easy fix from within fvwm.

the web page (didn't I?).

There are error messages output that indicate that actually, although
they aren't quite visible.  I was going to make the menu title be
something like "Read failed - builtin menu", but perhaps a simple
error dialog would be good.  I'll see what I can whip up (or at least
change the menu title).

Also, I think I'll add something like "Do you have an rc file now?
Restart fvwm" to that default menu, so you can try again without
completely exitting.

Yup - it gives me something to try anyways.  I'll look into it when I
get a chance and see if this allows me to reproduce it.

Thanks,

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk
X-Majordomo: 1.94-alpha7-jlt4

I've patched fvwm-2.0.43 to handle negative conditions with a leading
'!' character. I use 

  Next [!Iconic CurrentDesk CurrentScreen !Fvwm*] Focus

in my .fvwmrc to move to cycle through the windows on the current
screen. The "!Fvwm*" part is what ignores all windows with a name,
class, or resource matching "Fvwm*". I'd rather use the "go to the
next window ignoring these windows" style instead of "go to the next
window with a name like ____."

I managed to resist the temptation to put in complete regular
expressions, as that would break the documented behavior of Next and
Prev. Instead, I simply expanded the already existing '!' convention
to window names.

The patch isn't the prettiest. Perhaps I should have included misc.h
which would have gotten me the NoClass and NoResource variables to use
instead of the literal strings. 

I hope others will enjoy this patch.

Everyone should check the web page (URL after every message) when they
think they've found bugs; you may be able to get a quick fix.  This is
right there at the top of the latest news section, with patch.  Perhaps the
current bug list should be there too.

Hello,

Forgive me if I'm missing something obvious here,, but can you force
your cursor to remain in its current position upon an fvwm2 restart?
(It seems to jump 1/4 screen "south east" every time I restart.)

Thanks!
Jim

I know there are more important issues, but .....

In Fvwm95, a mini icon that is on the Title is described as a TitleIcon
and is defined the same way as the Icon is (with Style ... ).
Internally, it is M_TITLE_ICON.
But it is not only used with the Title of the Window.  It is used in the
FvwmTaskBar, and in the FvwmWinList(I did this, along with other
enhancements).

I propose that we do it a little differently in Fvwm2:


-- A new Button Style Flag

ButtonStyle 1 UseAppMiniIcon

-- and a new Application Style flag:

Style "xpaint"    MiniIcon mini-paint.xpm



Then I could change my FvwmWinList from using TitleIcon to
MiniIcon(Internally from M_TITLE_ICON to M_MINI_ICON), and hopefully
I/we could Convince the FvwmTaskBar and Fvwm95 authors to do the same.
Then Modules are compatible between the two. Then world peace will
occur.

Or instead of above, we could just use the Fvwm95 names.(though I dont
like them)

I have the problem with Linux too. Since 2.0.39 i believe. As posted 
earlier i have made a minimal .fvwm2rc that shows the problem. It does 
nothing but start FvwmPager. I found out that the bug only shows up when 
i use a preprocessor.

Here is the minimal .fvwm2rc:

# This enables paging when called with:
# fvwm2 -f "Read /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"
# But *not* when preprocessed:
# fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"
# fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp /home/stefh/test.fvwm2rc"

Hello,

Could you please tell me how I can set the Next function in my .fvwm2rc so
that all iconic windows and windows whose name are "desktop icon" are not
affected. I have tried the following (without success):

Key	Tab	A	M	Next [!iconic !"desktop icon"] Focus

This doesn't work!
I'm using fvwm-2.0.42.

Yes - I highly recommend this course of action as well.  I thought I
had put statements to that effect in the files included in the
distribution, but apparently not (must have just been in some note or
newsgroup post).  I'll make sure I do for 2.1.0.

That patch is at the bottom of the announcement as well.

Yes it should be and will be shortly.  How did I miss that?

Good idea (for the time being at least).

That would have been better, yes.

A variant of this might make it into 2.1.0, since it should be
relatively harmless and rather useful.

Slight trouble building it on OSF1 V3.2 alpha and IRIX 5.3.

On both platforms 'make' gave a lot of messages along the lines of:

Archive: ../libs/libfvwm2.a has no table of contents (not searched)
         add one with 'ar ts'
Unresolved:
matchWildcards
safemalloc
mystrcasecmp
mystrncasecmp
envDupExpand
GetFontOrFixed
DestroyPicture
CachePicture
sleep_a_little
GetFdWidth
mygethostname
InitPictureCMap
findIconFile
make[1]: *** [fvwm2] Error 1

Doing 'ar ts libs/libfvwm2.a' and a new 'make' solved this.




Selecting a window from WindowList will no longer give it focus. I
used to rely on this to transfer focus to window that did not have
their own keystrokes without having to move the pointer.




=46rom the ChangeLog:

       21. Added ExitFunction, to be executed on exit (before restarts too).
           Useful for explicitly killing modules, etc.

Is it practical to implement a hook that is only done before exits
(not before restarts), and, if that's the case, does anyone else see a
use for it? Currently, I'm (kind of) simulating this as follows

AddToFunc Terminer	I Exec sh -c \
"rsh tag gnudoit \'\(hf-save-all-and-terminate\)\'; exec xlogo"
+			I Wait xlogo
+			I Quit

(The first line has been broken for readability in this mail. In my
.fvwm2rc it's not.)




Does the following qualify as a bug?

Place the pointer in the root window. Transfer focus to an xterm using
a keystroke. Iconify xterm using keystroke (Style NoIcon). Fvwm does
not appear to accept *any* keystrokes until I've moved the pointer
(using the mouse since nothing else works) into some window.

This does not happen if the pointer is inside the xterm when you
iconify.

Fvwm does not even launch the init function, just exists without any message.

Opps - spoke too soon!  Actually, you can't do that because those vars
are in fvwm itself and that would mean that modules using libfvwm2.a
wouldn't be able to link due to those being unresolved!  I should make
those strings available as defines instead perhaps...

 Is there any reason why libfvwm is not implememented as a shared
object on OS's that have them, such as Linux?  Seems like all it would
take would be to use some #ifdef's in the .tmpl file, and add the Imake
rules for shared libraries inside them.

 I will pick up the O'Reily Nutshell Imake book next month if my
student budget permits, and look into doing that.  Maybe I can provide
a patch; that is, if I can figure out how to do it without spoiling
FVWM's makeability on OS's without shared libraries.

I know that Imake knows how to make shared libraries on systems that
support them.  There's probably some flag, so you could tell it to
make normal libraries and a shared if supported, then just do a
-Ldirectory -lfvwm, and it should do the right thing.

Not terribly polite to say, but good.  ;^)

I had remembered taking a brief look at misc.h, and had a vague
recollection that it wouldn't be easy or good. I feel better now that
it isn't as simple as adding "#include "misc.h" to the top. 

I also remembered that just below my patch is yet another check for

if (pattern == NULL)
  return TRUE

which can be deleted as thats the first thing I check for. But then
you probably already spotted that.

Thanks for picking up the patch.

 Ya, that's what I figure.  I will look into it next month when I can
afford the book, if it turns out I still need it.  I've UTSL'd some of
the Imake files, and found an article in the X journal that led to
some free information...  I have the doc files along with X11R6.1, but
havn't read them all yet.  Right now I'm busy learning Scheme, really
into it, and not wanting to take the parenthetical of Imake just now.

Well, although it shouldn't die (and I'll look into that when I get a
chance), you really have a syntax error there.  The first entry of the
function belongs on the the AddToFunc line, like so:

AddToFunc RxvtSmall "I" exec rxvt -ls -fat -bg Black -fg White -font -b\&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -8 -sl 512 &

Or, since those functions are only doing one thing anyways, why not
have the menu items just call the 'exec rxvt' directly instead of a
function call?  Or perhaps better, set up a function that takes font
to use as a parameter and have the menu call that passing in the font
size?

Hi,
I just "installed" fvwm2 on my sun.
Is it possible to "group" windows from a same resource when
(De)iconifying ? 
For example when I use the calendar manager (CM), I would like that
iconifying the main CM window "closes" the other CM windows (and not
iconifys them  with their proper icons).


Cheers, \yvan

OUCH!

I used to rely on FvwmWinList to warp the pointer to totally obscured windows.
As of 2.0.43 this is no longer the case.

WHATS MORE it doesn't seem to have an option to do this!!!

What happened?

How can I fix this *abberant* behavior???

This is the wrong fix.  The real problem is that a new packet type
(M_STRING) was added to FVWM, but not to FvwmAudio.c.  23 is the correct
value for MAX_MESSAGES.

A more correct way to fix the problem is to add the new type to the
definition of *messages[] in FvwmAudio.c, so that the indices match up.

Of course, this only fixes things until the next time MAX_MESSAGES
changes or the packet types change.  It would probably be better if
FvwmAudio.c did an explicit lookup into its own table, or at least if it
ensured that the indices for its builtins in the *messages[] array
didn't rely on a particular value of MAX_MESSAGES.

You could try FvwmIconMan. It's like FvwmWinList, but I think it's better,
but I'm predjudiced since I wrote it.

Or, if you want to stay with FvwmWinList, which I admit is better for
transient use, I bet that the problem comes from the change in the fvwm Focus
function which makes it no longer warp the cursor. If you use the
FvwmWinListAction option to bind WarpToWindow to a click event, that'll
probably work.

Actually, it's the "%small.xpm%" which makes it die.

The same icons I used with 2.0.40 kept working.

Because I also use a menu which is identical to the one above, but without
the title, and have put it into FvwmButtons. I also have an hotkey associated
with RxvtLarge and RxvtMedium.

> Or perhaps better, set up a function that takes font to use as a parameter

This is a good point :-)


Also, I tried to use FvwmButtons with both the config files you ship, but
the button bar simply doesn't appear.
The module tries to load, because it complains if there are syntax errors,
otherwise it silently does nothing.

The same goes for FvwmConfig and WinList.

Pager works, and also Identify, IconBox, Banner, Talk.

All The Best,
 Marco

Correct.  For those who don't recall, this was a much requested
feature (for Focus not to warp the pointer, that is).

Brady> If you use the FvwmWinListAction option to bind WarpToWindow to

Actually, better would be to use something like the following
function:

  AddToFunc FocusAndWarp "I" Focus
  +                      "I" WarpToWindow 2p 2p

and bind that to the click event (because WarpToWindow won't actually
change the focus on it's own in click to focus mode).

I prefer the following:

AddToFunc myfocus "I" $2
+ "I" WarpToWindow $0 $1
+ "I" Focus

I'm not sure if it matters what order one calls Focus and
WarpToWindow.

Typically I call it as

myfocus 50 50 Nop

which warps to the window and focuses.  However, I found that if the
window was iconified, WarpToWindow didn't automagically deiconfy it.
So I added the third argument so that from the FvwmIconMan actions, I
can specify

myfocus 50 50 "Iconify -1"

which does what I want.

Hi,

Are you using libXpm-4.7 by any chance? That version seems to have a bug
or incompatibility that causes fvwm to die when a pixmap cannot be found
or is corrupt. Version 4.3 or 4.6 works OK. 

Regards,
Hector.

Chuck,

Since the early days of fvwm-2, I have seen a problem when using a 
large value for the EdgeResistance timer such as:

   EdgeResistance 1000 50
   EdgeScroll 100 100

The 1000 says the pointer must be left at the screen edge for 1second 
before moving the viewport to a different page.  If the pointer is 
_retracted_ within this time period, life is supposed to go on 
uninterrupted.  Normally, it does.

However, if a window is being moved or resized when the pointer hits the 
edge, life does not go on _if the pointer is retracted within this time_ 
period.  Everything is temporarily put on hold for, say, 1second.  If it 
enters and exits the pan frame region multiple times before the mouse 
button is released, things can be put on hold for even longer!

The problem is the Pan Frames are "covered" by the window being 
moved/resized, so the "LeaveWindowMask" event is never seen and we get 
trapped inside of the sleep loop for the entire duration.  The patch 
below fixes this.  It also eliminates the window from lagging behind the 
pointer at the moment you hit the screen edge during a move/resize (a 
little aesthetic fix-up).

I submitted a patch for this a while back, but it seems to have never 
made its way into fvwm.  Here's a cleaner patch to fvwm-2.0.43.


Thanks,

Mike Blatchley

Hi,
I just installed fvwm2 on my sun. So far it is working fine.
I would like to know if it is possible to iconify group windows of same
resource into only one Icon.
For example, calendar manager (CM) (and many other programs) uses several
windows => Iconifying the main CM window would "close" the other CM windows.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do it?

Cheers \yvan

Incidentally, the Focus would not be needed for those who don't

then SetFocus() is called for non-ClickToFocus window.

Hi,

I believe that my problem is the same as for this patch, except a whole
lot worse.  There are times that all my windows freeze with everything 
blank when my mouse is near the screen edges.  I also have the problem
that EdgeResistance sometimes does not work but switches screens
when the mouse is just getting to the edge, but then not redrawing the
screen for a long wait.

The question I have is, how to you apply this patch?  I have a Sun OS 
4.1.3 system.  I have never delt with patches before.

Yeah, it must have slipped through the proverbial cracks, as things
often do...

I'll play with it and if things look ok with it, it'll be in 2.1.0.

Your problem may be related to that patch, but may also be partly
caused by an overworked system.  I know if something is churning away
on my machine, I'll see long delays in switching pages with symptoms
like what you describe.

See the FAQ, question #24:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

24) How do I create/submit/apply patches?

A: Creating a patch -

        1) Copy the originial source file(s) to the same name with the
           additional extension of .orig (or something like that).
        2) Then run diff with either the -c (context) or -u (unified)
           switch on the sets of files, with the .orig file FIRST.  I
           prefer unifified diff's because they are smaller, but
           sometimes they aren't as readable, so either context or
           unified diffs are fine.

        ex: cp fvwm.c fvwm.c.orig ; diff -u fvwm.c.orig fvwm.c

   Submitting a patch -

        Just mail it to the fvwm mailing list, is the best way I
        guess.

   Applying a patch -

        Get a copy of the program 'patch' from your favorite source,
        such as prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu, compile it, and then
        follow it's directions (generally just cd into the appropriate
        directory and run 'patch < patchfile').

A while ago I was playing with the latest version of xmille (not available
by FTP anymore since the X Consortium removed the directory it was residing
in), which uses the XKw library.  I managed to write an Imakefile that
generated a Makefile that created shared libraries.  I believe the
implementation I used is portable (I used the Imakefile from Xaw3d as an
example), so it should work on all platforms that have imake configured
properly.  Of course, it _should_ be a trivial matter to convert fvwm's
Imakefile, but I haven't looked at it in a long time...

I don't have the source here at work, but I can take a look when I go home
today.  E-mail me if you're interested.

Hello FVWM'ers!

I have an SGI Indy running IRIX 5.3 I have compiled fvwm 2 on it and everything
went fine!

I ran the make install to install the whole package... but after that... what
should I do next? I already have 4Dwm running. Do I need to play with the
different xdm files? How do I disable the 4Dwm and set up the fvwm running
instead? Will I still be able to open xwsh shells in fvwm?

Please any help would really be appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

Richard Soubyran

This is probably a dumb question, and maybe this isn't the right
place for it, but I can't find the answer in any of the archives.  How
does one get FvwmButtons to display icons?  I can only get text on the
buttons that launch the programs, even if I try tiny pixmaps.

Also, is there a way to control the geometry of buttons other than by
specifying the geometry of the whole button bar?  It would be nice
if oclock didn't get squashed into an oval.

Here's the relevant portion of my .fvwmrc.  BTW, I'm on Solaris2.4.
BTW2, yes, I've tried Tkgoodstuff.  It's really cool, but I don't care
for the way it uses the Pager - tho' maybe I could hack the Pager
client to do what I want.  My Buttons module has great potential, if I
can only get it to work :-)

Usually the window manager is started in the user's .xinitrc

Instead of starting 4Dwm, run fvwm.

I had trouble running xwsh in fvwm 1.24, don't know if it was
fixed when fvwm2.* came out or not. 

Good luck,

I guess my "use tkgoodstuff" reply is getting familiar... :-)

Is it the little windows that you miss?  If you prefer the FvwmPager (which is 
very nice), you can swallow it in tkgoodstuff just as you can in FvwmButtons 
(swallowing is a new feature in tkgoodstuff in the last month or two).  I know 
you may still prefer FvwmButtons, but I thought I'd send this just in case...

Also, how can anyone resist tkgoodstuff now that we use TABBED NOTEBOOK 
configuration dialogs (just added)?!

The best thing to do is to have a ~/.xinitrc that does something like
this (copy the system.xinitrc that is somewhere in your file system to
your home dir):

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Some other commands that loads X resource or setup the keyboard, but
# none that starts any application!
xsm
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

"xsm" is the X session manager. With it you can have some configured
sessions and choose one of them via a menu at startup. See xsm(1).

Or, if you prefer something simpler, take a ~/.xinitrc like this:

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Some other commands that loads X resource or setup the keyboard.
fvwm2 &
xterm
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, as xterm is your last application, you can safelly quit the
window manager and start another from the menu (fvwm) or from the
xterm. You have to do a "logout" at the xterm to quit your session.

Hope this helps.

Emilio.

well, now you just have to have X start fvwm for you instead of 4Dwm...
create a file in your home directory called .xsession (make sure it's
executable) and in the file, run the program. Also make sure you have a
.fvwm2rc file in your home directory as well (like a copy of the default
one).

Ok, go for it! ;-)

Actually something like that has crossed my mind.  Configuring styles, 
options, and some modules ought to be fairly straightforward using the 
tkgoodstuff configuration utility widgets.  Indeed, there's no reason to have 
much of an .fvwm2rc, since tkgoodstuff could send fvwm most of the rc file 
commands.

But the tkgoodstuff configuration tool now does not do "on the fly" 
configuration---it requires restarting tkgoodstuff.  Anyway, to do a 
reasonably general thing would be a lot of work, and right now I'm aiming for 
a relatively robust version of the current feature set to be ready by when 
fvwm2.1 is released (all bug reports welcome).

But I'd welcome a collaborator to work on this idea.

Mark

This has been a goal of a lot of people and it is a difficult task.
Is it ?

Some recent features of fvwm has shown a new way (and better way) of 
handling fvwm configuration. Since we can load/reload part of fvwm 
configuration separatly, it is now much more practical to define a set of 
configuration utility which each is much more easier to built and much 
more useful.

We have to turn this problem upside down. What does a new and existing 
user manipulate often in fvwm and at which moment.

Here is how I would split the task

1-Menu configurator

Currently, it is possible to reconfigure menu on demand. With the new 
PipeRead command for example, one can define a utility to edit/configure 
a menu and can also define a small utility to read it and update if needed
fvwm.

All my menus look like this

	title
	------
	opt
	opt
	opt
	------
	Config

When you click on "Config", this trigger the configurator for this menu. 
Whenever you save the new menu configuration, it becomes immediatly 
effective the next time you activate this menu. Currently my "Config" 
option just load a text editor showing this menu. This is already better 
than browsing the filesystem looking for a .fvwmrc and then browsing the 
kit.

(Those who are interested in my config files and my fvwmreadmenu utility 
(which was send to the maintainer for inclusion in the contrib part of 
fvwm), just email).

2-FvwmButtons configurator

It is now possible to kill/reload the fvwmbutton configuration since 
2.0.43. Again doing a configurator for such a thing is not that much 
difficult (more than doing a menu configurator however).

3-General setup of fvwm

This contain few (not all really) other feature. One utility (fvwmconfig 
I think) was already a good start allowing one to switch some key feature 
such as focus).

3-Style editor

	A fairly simple dialog allowing to activate some key feature 
application per application. I would hook this editor right in the 
application menu (left menu of each application window). This would 
configure the style for the running window/class.

Achieving 1 2 and 4 is not a big job and would satisfy most users giving 
them a straight way to modify most of the important things of fvwm.

I really don't think a big "config" utility is the key.

Anyone interested to help me with this ?

I often run several emacs at the same time and since I usually
have lots of frames (windows in X terminology) open in each emacs
session and some applications that I run from them (eg xdvi), I
always run each session on a different page to separate them
clearly (otherwise it is really hard to remember which frame/app
belows to which emacs session ;-).

I already know about "StartsOnDesk" and use that so that I have
one desk with several pages just for emacs sessions.

Usually I just start with one emacs running and then run more as
required. I would find it _very_ useful if I could start a new
emacs on a different, unused page automatically.

Ok, this could be implemented at various levels of
sophistication.  I guess I would be happy with just a function,
that would circulate to the next page with no applications on it
(if such a page is available).

Is it possible to make such a function at present in fvwm2?  If
so, does anyone have such a function?

Thanks, Jens

Richard

On the SGIs the Xserver is already running. When you "log in" at the
login box you are actually running an xdm "session". As the session
starts a script called /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession is run. This looks for a
file called $HOME/.xsession and runs that if it exists. The first time you
use a .xsession file you will be prompted with a dialog box. Just click
OK (or Continue, can't remember which).

Your .xsession should start clients, window manager, etc. I have a couple
of examples below which also run your .profile, for sh, bash users. You'll
have to hack this if you have csh as your login shell. I like to
run the .profile so that all clients inherit environment variables
(remember this is a "session", not a "login").

I recommend you get the "xsession" program which allows you to manage
your session, change window managers on the fly, etc. Should be available
at your local x.org mirror (I can probably get you an Irix 5.3 binary if
you have trouble). If you get it the following .xsession would be suitable:

######################################################################
## run user's Xdefaults
if [ -f ${HOME}/.Xdefaults ] ; then
  xrdb -load ${HOME}/.Xdefaults
fi

## source system profile
if [ -f /etc/profile ] ; then
  . etc/profile
fi

## source user's profile 
if [ -f ${HOME}/.profile ] ; then
  . ${HOME}/.profile
fi

## Clear root window
xsetroot -def                       

## START CLIENTS HERE
## These must run in the background. 

##  start an xterm and any other clients here 
xterm &

## xsession now takes over management of the session. This must come
## last. Quit xsession to quit X. 
xsession -defaultWM fvwm2
######################################################################


If you don't have xsession, use this:

######################################################################
## run user's Xdefaults
if [ -f ${HOME}/.Xdefaults ] ; then
  xrdb -load ${HOME}/.Xdefaults
fi

## source system profile
if [ -f /etc/profile ] ; then
  . etc/profile
fi

## source user's profile 
if [ -f ${HOME}/.profile ] ; then
  . ${HOME}/.profile
fi

## Clear root window
xsetroot -def

## start window manager
fvwm2 & wmpid=$!

## START CLIENTS HERE
## These must run in the background. 

##  start an xterm and any other clients here 
xterm &

## wait for the wm to exit, i.e. quitting fvwm will exit the X session
wait $wmpid
######################################################################


A really minimal .xsession would be:

######################################################################
xterm &
fvwm2
######################################################################


Make sure you have a file ${HOME}/.fvwm2rc, otherwise fvwm2 won't run.
Just copy the system.fvwm2rc supplied.

I'd like to add that I can't get Icons on buttons with
FvwmButtons. I'm willing to work with someone to help debug it as
well.

Some facts:
Using the 2.0.42 beta packages and applied no patches.
using xbms because I don't have xpms installed.
It doesn't work with either a legacy configuration command or the new
type commands.

I'm not complaining, FvwmButtons is a great tool, but this is
annoying.

Thanks in advance.

I have a question about some of the linked libraries.  Specifically XPM.  
I'm trying to install fvwm2.042 but I think my libraries are all screwed 
up.  This is the message I'm dying on (I tried taking the whole statement 
out of the source ... but then ran into other problems):
"Picture.c", line 67: undefined struct/union member: closeness
"Picture.c", line 69: undefined symbol: XpmCloseness

I've tried compiling on a freshly built sunos 4.1.4 system and also on 
solaris 2.4.  I can't seem to get this thing installed because of missing 
libraries and as a side note .. where do I find missing X libraries?  

Any help would be appreciated.

you should make sure it's finding a config file.  in my experience, fvwm2
does this if, for example, you have a .fvwmrc and not an .fvwm2rc (and
didn't set it up to look for .fvwmrc).  seems like lousy behavior,
actually, for it to deal so ungracefully with not finding a config file...

but maybe that's already been fixed?

Hi Dorothy,
	I just answered this question before I saw yours, so try

*FvwmButtons Xemacs             gnu.xpm         Exec "Xemacs"
/usr/bin/xemacs -geometry 95x41+22+9 &

Where gnu.xpm is an Icon, this is just an example. I am using
fvwm2-2.0.43-1 on Linux and it works fine.

Make sure you have a path like this to your Icons:
IconPath   /usr/X11/bitmaps/:/etc/X11/fvwm2/icons

Hope this helps,

Hi all,

When using fvwm2 as my window manager on my Linux box,
when invoking Seyon I get complaints from that app like:
"/dev/modem: no such device".  Seyon works fine, however,
when using the fvwm that cam with my 1.2.1 Linux 
distribution.  Any ideas?

Have checked that /dev/modem exsists ? It should be a link to the
device file you are using for your modem, i.e. 
/dev/modem --->/dev/cua0 . This has nothing to do with FVWM at all.
Seyon must default to look for a device file called /dev/modem.
Check and see where your modem is connected, such as use dmesg
and read the output and look for the serial ports.

Hope this helps,

Your problem is that the XPM library doesn't come with the system.

>From the FAQ:

13) I'm trying to build FVWM, but the linker is complaining about
    missing functions like 'XpmReadFileToPixmap' or the compiler can't
    find the include file X11/xpm.h.  Why is that?

A: You need to have the Xpm library on your system.  You can find the
   source for it at ftp.x.org in /contrib/libraries.  Or you can
   compile without Xpm support (see the configure.h file) and lose out
   on all the pretty color icons.

Hi,

I intend to use two monitors and two graphic adapters with a SUN Sparcstation 5 
(TurboGXPlus graphics adapter). The first tests I did with CDE wm (shudder...), 
revealed that I cannot move a window from one monitor to another and that a 
window cannot reside partly on monitor one and partly on monitor two.

I wonder whether this is a problem of TurboGXPlus, X or CDE wm. Since I do not 
believe in CDE wm at all :-) and since I am quite a fan of fvwm, I still hope 
that at least moving a window from one monitor to another is possible with 
fvwm. Maybe even having a window spread over two monitors (having a window on 
partly on a page seems to be similar).

Till now I used fvwm 1.24r and had a look at fvwm2-95, but I did not find any 
hint in that direction. Does anyone have experiences with dual monitors?

Thanks for your help
Martin

That's correct.  The default X11R6 (R5/OpenWindows) X servers do not
support this feature.  I have 3 monitors on my SS5 which means fvwm
will launch 3 window managers.

It's not really a window manager issue.  There is a modified X11R6
server called XVan that merges all the frame buffers into one virtual
display.  XVan+fvwm does allow you to move windows between monitors.

I tried XVan for a while but found it confusing having one huge
virtual screen with a virtual desktop on top of it.

BTW, I think there's another program called xmove that can move
applications between displays.

FABULOUS idea.  I liek that a lot.  This is one feature of IRIX I really

  - More controll over icon appearance (non 3D, fg/bg colors, etc)?

Another FABULOUS idea.  I hate the fact that when an icon gets focus teh 
3d-border around it lights up. All my icons already have a 3d-border ;)

I am beginning work on a style option that will emulate SGI's IRIX 
handling of Icons.  
	All icons will be uniform in size and shape
	All icons will have a uniform border(based on teh active window color?)
	All icons will align to a grid (I hope someone does this before me ;)
	Icon titles will behave more liek SGI..

just a few things I like about SGI that I would liek to see as an option 
in fvwm..

Also maybe a CDE-like frontpanel Module?  CDE for linus has been 'in the 
works' for a long time...I personally like front-panel and think if fvwm 
beats whoever to it, great!

again..
please CC me messages... ;)

Hello,

I was trying to compile version 2.0.43 on my linux 2.0 ELF/aout box. It
did not work, and I got a lot of error messages about a missing library.  
I could not locate this library anywhere. 

library is /usr/X11R6/lib/libXExExt.a

Do you know where to find it?

Thanks!

	- Igor.

ok, I said I was going to work on an SGI'ish set of patches for fvwm...
I have just learned that I am NOT an X programmer (yet)...

WOW!  I will outline my ideas, so maybe someone with a clue where to 
start can implement it...

in .fvwm2rc:
Style "*" SGIIcon   # this will trigger SGI handling of icons

things it would do:
-------------------
1. When iconified, a pixmap would be enclosed in a frame, (cut this into 
an xpm and view it..)

/* XPM */
static char * frame_xpm[] = {
"66 70 3 1",
"       c #FFFFFFFFFFFF",

ok: assume the grey areas are the active window color, or get their own color 
property in fvwm2rc...
the highlight would be something quite brighter than teh body color, but 
in teh same strain, and teh shadow would be a number of steps darker than 
teh body color (close to black)

This imposes a limitation of 55x45 for the interior pixmap. I suppose, it 
could be scaled larger.  I only chose that because that is the size of 
the 3dpixmaps package that many people seem to be using -1 (to add teh 
interior bevel, which those icons already have)  
Oversized pixmaps would be dealt with in some manner (center and cut off the 
edges would be my suggestion?)

The icon name would go in teh bottom most filed.

2.Icons woudl always line up in a grid in teh IconBox property area.  
eg:

XX
XX  is an icon...


XXYY  ZZ
XXYY  ZZ
  XX
  XX

icons can be moved,but they snap to the grid space closest..

3. The neat border that shows up on icons when they become Active would 
be gone..

4. The icon name field below the icon is teh same color as the icon

These are the majority of my wishes for icons...they seem picky, but the 
icons sure look nice....

anyone out there want to work with me on this? Or is it a dumb idea? I 
can do it for myself by actually making teh icons these xpms, but I would 
much rather see teh wm do teh management...


Anxiously awaiting a reply!!!
Tim

Does anyone have the Netscape Icon? I'll take it as either an xpm file
or an xbm file.

Thanks in advance.

Xvan sounds interesting but I'm not sure I want to give up display

Ah, for the days of NeXTSTEP!  That was one of the coolest things
about that OS on my dual-headed SS5.  I found it to be quite handy,
although dual-head support had a couple of minor problems.

Unfortunately, this is not possible on OpenWindows because it's not
something the server supports, regardless of the window manager.  I've
heard of 3rd party servers that provide this functionality, but
haven't investigated it much.

On the FVWM side, I really need to sit down and try to write up, or
fix some of its problems with dual-headed machines.  2.0.42 isn't
quite there compared to the best dual-headed wm I've used: ctwm 3.3

One immediately noticable problem is that focus doesn't always get
directed to the correct screen.  I can quite often have focus stick to
the wrong screen.  Its almost as if sloppy focus is on (tho I'm nearly
sure I turn it off for all my windows).  Hmm, as I said, I haven't had
much time to really dig into this since it's nearly good enough and
most of my complaints are just nits.

I couldn't find xmove at ftp.x.org either.  I just searched with Alta
Vista and found it in comp.sources.x/volume21/xmove.

Hello,
I noticed a smallish bug in fvwm:
When a new window with a private colormap is mapped (or there is a
colormap change on some toplevel window), I think that fvwm should
install that colormap and then come back to the current colormap, even
if the window doesn't have the focus.
This way, the window will have the right colors on multiple colormap
systems (the Indy here supports 4 colormaps and the HP has 2).
Mwm installs these colormaps properly, BTW.

I'm using fvwm-2.0.43 under HP/UX 10.01 on an HP 712, using a locally
compiled version of X11R6.1, and it eats the first character of a line
following a blank line.  The following change fixes the problem.

I'm trying to make a button that will go to the page where I have an
emacs frame in which vm is running. I would like focus to be given to
that frame and then use gnudoit to send emacs a "vm-get-new-mail"
command.

I'm using a combination of windows commands and gnudoit, but it always
seems to try to happen in another emacs frame where vm is not running
so the "vm-get-new-mail" fails.

Does anyone have this or something similar running?

Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to set up a diskless client to run fvwm2. My fvwm2rc uses
fvwmM4. I already have fvwm running on the server, and when I try to start
it on the client, I get this error, and fvwm never comes up, I'm just
stuck with the grey X screen:

"exclusive open for tmp_name failed in m4_defs: Permission denied"

If I run startx as root, I don't get the error, and fvwm comes up fine.

Anyone know what could be causing this error? 

Maybe a bit of detail on how I have the diskless client set up might be in
order. Both client and server are running linux. The diskless client
mounts server:/ as it's root filesystem via nfs. I'm using a kernel patch
called transname-patch that lets the client and server have different
config files, even though they are both mounting the same filesystem as
their root filesystem. (I won't go into the details here..)

Check the permissions on your /tmp/ directory.  Do you have write
permission?

Thanks, that was the problem. I had a /tmp with all the proper
permissions, but the client I was running fvwm2 on was using a different
directory as /tmp, and I had negelcted to fix the permissions there.

fi

if  [ ! -z $(type -path fvwm) ]; then

        exec fvwm

Noting that my vm window always has "INBOX" in the title, I tried
entering

Next [*INBOX*] Focus

into FvwmTalk, and this shifted my pointer to the INBOX window.

Presumably, by replacing "Focus" with a function invocation, this
could be extended to do what you require?

(assuming fvwm2, of course).

Hi all.

I would greatly thank if someone can help me about the errors that I always
get when I restart fvwm.
I'm on fvwm2.0.43 at the moment.
THis is the mesg that it always said :
	[FVWM][DONE]: <<ERROR>> Call of '' failed!!!

The funny thing is, this doesn't happen when I fire up the fvwm for the 
first time. Then if I restart it, it gave  me that crappy message.

(I assume you've made 'fvwm' a link to 'fvwm2'.)

You're probably seeing this now, right?

| [FVWM][Done]: <<ERROR>> Call of 'fvwm
| ' failed!!!!

That's a bug in either the FvwmButtons module or the code in fvwm2 that
parses input for the Restart directive; I've reported it to the list
previously, but gotten no acknowledgement.  The problem is that the
configuration line that gets sent to the module ("*FvwmButtons [...]")
has a newline on the end; FvwmButtons doesn't strip the newline, and
when it sends the Restart command back to fvwm2, the newline's still on
the end.  Unfortunately, fvwm2 also doesn't seem to remove the trailing
whitespace, so it tries to exec "fvwm\n" (which causes the error).

A brute force workaround is to insert a null character at the end of
the line in your .fvwm2rc file, but it's probably not worth the trouble.

(Is this bug fixed for 2.1?)

Hi,

I haven't been able to figure out how to get my clock to start up
automatically since switching to fvwm (it's been a long time).

I start fvwm from .xinitrc, so it has to be the last app (as I
understand it, anyway).  If I start oclock from .xinitrc, I get a silly
title bar stuck to the top of the clock.  That's actually what I'm
trying to avoid.

If I start oclock from my initfunction, I end up with extra clocks every
time I restart fvwmrc.  I tried making the start function different from
the restart function, but it seems like it's calling the start function
even on restart.

I'm running 2.0pl33.

Does anyone have this sort of thing working?  Or, what do I need to do
to get fvwm not to put the title bar on oclock when oclock is started
before fvwm?


thanks,
tw

It's not that hard, here is a clip from my .fvwmrc:

This is my initialization routine

# Stuff to do at start-up

AddToFunc "InitFunction" "I" Exec xsetroot -solid "#266294"
+              "I" Exec /home/lmyers/bin/plan -iconic
+              "I" Module FvwmAuto 750
+              "I" Exec xterm
+              "I" Exec xterm -vb -T "Console" -C
+              "I" Module FvwmButtons
+              "I" Module FvwmPager 0 6
+              "I" Exec xpostit+ -tmpdir /home/lmyers -iconic
+              "I" Exec xrefresh
+              "I" Exec tkpostage -geometry +423-0   <--  I start this, but it                                                           doesn't get restarted.

AddToFunc "RestartFunction" "I" Exec xsetroot -solid "#266294"

+              "I" Module FvwmButtons    <------ This is what gets restarted.
+              "I" Module FvwmPager 0 6
+              "I" Module FvwmAuto 750
+              "I" Exec xrefresh


And this is how I restart FVWM:

# This menu is invoked as a sub-menu - it allows you to quit,
# restart, or switch to another WM.
AddToMenu "Quit-Verify" "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
+              "Yes, Really Quit" Quit
+              "Restart fvwm2" Restart fvwm2  <-------------------- Here it is
+              "Start twm" Restart twm
+              "Start tvtwm" Restart tvtwm
+              "Start mwm" Restart mwm
+              "" Nop
+              "No, Don't Quit" Nop


Hope this helps

This may be related to a problem I've been having: sometimes some of
the things started in my .xsession don't get the style attributes.
See if restarting fvwm after everything in your .xinitrc finishes
running fixes this.  I'd only noticed the problem in more recent
versions (2.0.42 and .43) though.

I have a similar problem with v1.24r using M4 on my linux workstation. It
works fine, except that the first person to log via XDM _after_ a root
login always gets the "system.fvwmrc" file. When I check /tmp, I find that
there's a fvwmrcM4xxx (or some such - not sure of the name) that is owned
by root.

Suspect that that M4 processing stuff isn't cleaning up after itself after
a session ends. Could be fixed by wiping /tmp after each session ends, I
suppose. I just live with it.

Actually, it's always been there.  In fact, it probably existed in
1.xx as well, but since it is timing related it never really showed up
for anyone then.

I think I have it fixed for the 2.1.0 release though.

The problem is in fvwm's usage of XGrabServer and XUngrabServer.  The
former isn't called soon enough in the startup process, and the latter
may be accidentally being called too soon due to a nested call
situation...  Well, the details aren't that important I guess.
Basically I just put a wrapper around those two calls so that they
keep track of the server grab request "nest level" and only call
XUngrabServer if it's the last one, and I moved the initial
XGrabServer call further up in the startup procedure.  This should fix
things, although since I don't see the problem to begin with, it's
hard to actually test this...

I'll try and make a patch to test this and post it soon (hopefully),
since I'd like to know if it truly fixes things before I get 2.1.0
out.  Or I could just make one more beta to test this, I guess, and
then put 2.1.0 out right after that.

Hi Eric!

welcome to Linux. It will bring a lot of fun to your life.

EL> my .Xclients contains following..

So, is "fvwm" in your path? If you type

        type -path fvwm

from the bash prompt, do you see any output? (You should.)

Is your binary really called "fvwm", and not "fvwm2"?

BTW, the line

        if  [ ! -z $(type -path fvwm) ]; then

can be replaced with

        if  [ -n $(type -path fvwm) ]; then

although this is not the problem.

Hope this helps.

Howdy all.

Could those of you who are experiencing the troubles with windows
started before fvwm in your .xinitrc not getting style attributes set
correctly please try the enclosed patch and let me know how well it
works for you?

There is miscellaneous other stuff in there too that will be in 2.1.0
as well, but just ignore that for now.

Thanks,
Chuck

First, to apply this patch, you'll need to use the flag on patch to ignore
whitespace. Using GNU patch, this is -l (ell, not one)

Now, I've applied this patch, but I'm still getting the same timing
problem with a window not getting Style flags. :(

I do have an addition to report. I've noticed that other WM functions
don't seem to work inside the Style-less window. For examle, I have
Meta-F1 bound to restart the WM everywhere, including inside windows.
However, when I was focused in and my mouse was in the Styleless window,
Meta-F1 wasn't caught by fvwm, but passed to the window (an rxvt). In an
rxvt with all it's Style attributes, however, the restart with Meta-F1
succeeds.

Again, for debugging purposes, my fvwm2rc can be found at
http://dosa.ini.cmu.edu/~manojk/fvwm2rc.

Acck. Just reread the message. The addition is to myu previous bug
reports. I don't think this new behavior started with the posted patch.

Odd.  I didn't have to when I checked it before I sent it out.

Damn.  Not what I wanted to hear...

Just out of curiousity, when are these windows popping up?  Is it
while fvwm is rebordering the windows (which shouldn't be happening
now, but what I had suspected of being the original problem), or
before or after that seems to start/stop?

Greetings to those of the list.  I just joined, although I have been 
using fvwm for a few years.

And, ofcourse, I have a question:

I tried to compile fvwm2.0.41 for my Linux system.  I guess I was 
spoiled, because the last time I compiled fvmw, it compiled right out of 
the 'box'.  This time, I've had all sorts of problems, and have been 
unable to get it to compile.

I am using Linux 1.2.11 with X11R6.  The last time I compiled, somehow, 
the X11 directory permissions got changed so that only root could access 
it.  It was a sneeky sort of problem that took me 1/2 hour to figure 
out.  So, I'm a little leery of trying it again without more learned 
advise.  I am not using an elf system, BTW, just a.out


Any suggestions?

Thanks-

I have a menu that appears when I click with my right button on the
background:

AddToMenu "DeskMenu"
+ "Grab a Shell%mini-term.xpm%" Exec rxvt
+ "" Nop

are the first items added.

If I click once, let the menu show up, I'm guessing if I let greater than
0.5s pass between the time I click to bring the menu up and the time I click
on this button to 'grab a shell' I get no error messages.

However, if I click quickly, which is the reason I have it as the first
item on the menu, then I get the following errors from fvwm:

[FVWM][executeModule]: <<ERROR>> Execution of module failed: /usr/local/lib/fvwm/
Permission denied

This is with fvwm 2.0.43.  I have no clue why this would happen, but it
doesn't seem like the right behavior to me!

How would I create a key binding to make ALT-TAB cycle through the

Any help will be greatly appreciated...thanks!

Put a line like this in your .fvwm2rc (I assume you're using fvwm 2.xx here):

Key Tab A M Next [*] Focus

In fvwm 1.xx, put a line like this in your .fvwmrc:

Key Tab A M CirculateUp

Your problem is on the first line of your menu definition, AddToMenu "DeskMenu".
Fvwm expects an item and command of some sort after each AddToMenu command, so the
way you have it now, Fvwm interprets there being some sort of null command there,
and tries to execute it, failing of course.  At least, that's the way I interpreted
it when I got the same errors.  The way to fix it is to move the first line of you
menu definition to the AddToMenu line, like this:
    AddToMenu "DeskMenu" "Grab a Shell%mini-term.xpm%" Exec rxvt &
It's ugly, yes, but it works.  The Fvwm developers should fix this for 2.1.0, if
they can.  It's not so bad if you do something like:
    AddToMenu "DeskMenu" "Desk Menu" Title
Then you can pretend that the Title is meant to go in the AddToMenu line :)

Hope this helps!

1) Ultrix still lacks strdup.  This should ensure that it is

2) I don't like adding any default include and lib path for
   linking (in this case for Audio), but at least only add it if you
   are using that feature. [Imakefile]

3) As with 2.0.42, fvwm does not link properly on Solaris, at least
   under R6.  [Imakefile]

4) strdup implementation to make Ultrix happy. [libs/strdup.c]

Here's a sequence of events that I have found so far. My startup is pretty
fast at home (Yay Linux!), but I'll try this on a slow school machine if I
get a chance, to get more detail on the seq. of events and try different
combinations. 

0. There is an xconsole open on the screen while xdm is waiting for login.

1. I login. xconsole is not killed.

2. rxvt pops up with minimal dark-gray decorations.

3. xconsole is iconified (StartIconic in fvwm2rc)

4. modules pop up

Here are all the details I've come up with on this poor unloved window:

- Titlebar has no buttons.

- Dark gray decorations

- mouse bindings (Meta-mouse3) seem to work on unloved window decorations

- key bindings (Meta-F1) fail with focus on the unloved window itself (W
in fvwm2rc) 

- Restart fixes all problems

I think this covers all the symptoms. Once again, my fvwm2rc:

I spent over an hour last night trying to work out why the line

  Style XTerm Icon xterm.xpm 

in ~/.fvwmrc was apparently being ignored and eventually found the
problem by tracing the executable and watching which files it tried
to open.  The problem was a trailing space on the line after xterm.xpm,
left there by a previous edit.  This space was being taken as part of
the filename, causing the open to fail.  I haven't looked at the code
closely to see if the same happens elsewhere, but the problem seems to
be a missing isspace() around line 316 of style.c

RedHat Software, along with DEC and others, sponsored a competition for
RedHat Linux users to configure desktops.  Most of the entries use fvwm,
or a variant thereof.  The winners were announced yesterday, and all the
entries (with directions on how to use them) were posted so that the X and
Linux communities can benefit.  See:

http://www.redhat.com/redhat/dtc/winners.html

(The list of entries appears at the bottom of the page)

In particular, my entry shows off the capabilities of using the FvwmM4
module and the m4 macro language.  It and others are great starting points
for FVWM configurations.  Enjoy!

and FVWM 2.xx, hoping that other people will keep pushing FVWM to its

  When I click on the title bar of a window the pointer changes to a
circle and there seems to be a strange delay of perhaps 1.5 seconds
before I can really do anything.  I have had this problem with all the
versions of fvwm that I can remember as well as v2.0.43.  Does someone
know of a way to remove this delay? 

  Please send me mail since I am not subscribed to this list.

  Thanks.

I was wondering if it is possible to designate colors for the
selected text/seleection bar of a menu, and also designate a
font/style/color/bgcolor for the title of a menu.  If it is not
possible, perhaps this would be a neat feature to add for the next
release.

Thanks

Hi Folks,

I'd like to use FvwmIconMan (or WinList, but I don't think that will
work) for the following:

I use 3x2 page desktop with a lot of Emacs windows floating around on
various pages. I can make an icon manager with only the emacs
windows. I'd really like to be able to both of the following actions
(i.e., with different mouse buttons):

 - uniconify the window if necessary and switch to the page it's on.
 - uniconify the window but have it pop up on the current page

Ideally, I'd like to have the button iconify the window if and only if
it's got focus on the current page, as well.

Is any of this possible?

Thanks,

Andrew

Do you know of any companies who have bundled fvwm into their
product(s) that are commercially marketed?  If so, do you have a list
(doesn't have to be an exhaustive list)?

By bundled, this could mean that it's not necessarily obvious or
advertised to the user that fvwm is the window manager.

This is the time that Fvwm waits to see if you're doing a double
click.  Just move the mouse a couple of pixels and you'll see that
Fvwm doesn't wait any longer.

You can set this time from your .fvwm(2)rc file, I think it's the
ClickTime parameter.

It occurs in the last phase of compilation ... all the libraries are in

when it bombed it was within the C code ...

You get 2.0.43 where this is fixed (I think) or you just fix it
yourself:  strerror(x) can be substituted with sys_errlist[x] on
SunOS.  Just:

    #ifdef <Variable_that_sez_SunOS_goes_here>
    #define strerror(x) sys_errlist[x]
    #endif

somewhere.  There is a compiler option that tells you what
preprocessor symbols are defined on your system.

I hope this is not too vague,

Your problem is probably the video card (i.e. the chipset).  Since there is no
accelerated X-server for the trident chipset, programs are going to run
inherently slow, as far as drawing windows is concerned.  Netscape is slow
anyway, though.  I believe there is an accelerated server available, but it is 
commercial.

Most (all?) of the cdrom Linux distributions have fvwm distributed
with them and I believe most set it up as the default window manager.

Actually the above #define is not safe.  Consider what happens when (x)
is outside the range [0..sys_nerr).  A better choice is to get a copy of
strerror(3) from 4.4BSD, FreeBSD2.x, Linux, bind-4.9.[34] or similar.

How can I get fvwm to raise a window whenever there's a click anywhere in
the window (rather than only in the title bar)?  If this is not possible,
then is it at least possible to make it raise if you click on any part of
the border (sides, bottom, top, or title bar)?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone can offer...

You're right.  But this very quick and very dirty solution has been
working for me for the past few months.  Your suggestion is prolly
better, but then there's 2.0.43 where this is fixed (isn't it?)...

I have in my .fvwmrc (or .fvwm2rc):

Mouse 1 WFSIT   4       Move-or-RaiseLower

Just say `Raise' instead of `Move-or-RaiseLower'.  And use a different
modifier than 4 (which is the Alt key on my Sun Type 5 keyboard
running under Solaris 2.5/OpenWindows).  S (Shift) or C (Ctrl) might
be good values.

I don't advise you to use N (No modifier) or A (Any modifier) as that
would mean that Fvwm grabs your mouse click and it isn't passed on to
the application any longer.

Another approach is to use ClickToFocus where the default is to raise
the window when you click in it.

Good luck! The real problem is that you will loose your cut/paste capability
if you do this with just a Click, along with messing up alot of other
applications. If you make it Control-Click, you will not be able to alter
your xterm settings and such. 

What I have settled with is to bind it to Meta-Click (The diamonds on my
Sparc5 keyboard by the space bar). This was the best compromise I could
find.

I use this:
Mouse 1         W       M       Raise

Not exactly the convienience of Win95, but still alot better then hunting
for a window border.

I think that you can do this by making a fvwm function to uniconify
the window, and then either warp the cursor to that window, or set the 
focus to that window. The Focus function will switch to the page the window's
on I believe.

The StickyIcon style flag might do this for you.

Well, you can bind a key or button event to iconify whichever window has the
focus, which is kinda similar. Also can make an fvwm binding to a key so that
it sends the appropriate command to FvwmIconMan to iconify the focused window
- that way it'll work wherever your mouse is (and it's hard to pass a key
event to FvwmIconMan unless it's got the focus). Don't see any way to do
exactly what you ask though. 

Also, I don't know if this addresses any problem you want to solve, but
since all your questions are page related, if you haven't checked out 
FvwmIconMan's resolution flag, it might be handy.

I've had much trouble trying to get imake to cooperate and correctly make
FVWM version 2.0.x under Solaris 2.5. Has anyone had experiences like
this? I haven't heard too much comment from the list about it, so
perhaps there is a quick and dirty fix? It makes just fine on ly Linux
box. The errors I get back from the MakeMakefiles script look like:

FTR: dual-headed Sun Sparc 5, Solaris 2.5, OpenWindows 3.5, fvwm 2.0.43

Here's the problem with running fvwm on my dual-headed sparc.  I am
using MouseFocus (I set this explicitly, just in case).  I start up an
XEmacs window which is jammed against the right edge of screen :0.0.
My BorderWidth and HandleWidth are 3.  The mouse is in this window,
and the window gets focus.  My window border is highlighted and
XEmacs' cursor is solid.  All is well.

Now I move the mouse slightly to the right so that my cursor is now
over my :0.1 screen's root window (there are no windows on :0.1 yet).
Interestingly enough, XEmacs' border gets de-highlighted, but its
cursor stays solid (meaning it still thinks it has focus).  Now, even
though the cursor is over my :0.1 screen, all keypress events go to
the XEmacs window on :0.0.  Bad!

Now, if I click the mouse over :0.1's root window (popping up a menu
over the root window), suddenly XEmacs's cursor turns hollow and now,
all keypress events get handled by fvwm.  I have various R context
keypresses defined and these now get handled correctly (i.e. `x' with
R context pops up an xterm -- this xterm properly gets displayed on
screen :0.1).

Okay, now I go back to my XEmacs window on :0.0 and move it slightly
to the left, so it's now in the middle of the screen and there is a
small strip of root window between it and the right edge of :0.0.  I
put the mouse over XEmacs and I'm now at my initial state.

Now I slowly move my cursor toward the right, so that it is over the
root window of :0.1, but this time it has passed over :0.0's root
window on the way.  As soon as the cursor moved into :0.0's root
window, the XEmacs border got de-highlighted and its cursor got
hollow.  At this point, the cursor is over :0.1's root window, and now
I type a keystroke.  This event goes to the fvwm running on :0.0!  So
it gets directed to the root window, but on the wrong X screen.  Once
again, clicking on the root window of :0.1 now correctly directs all
keypresses to :0.1.

One further weird thing about the above scenario.  If I go through the
recipe in the last paragraph above, and type `x' to pop up an xterm,
the xterm shows up on :0.0, even though the keypress was on :0.1.  I
now move the mouse into the xterm window; it's border gets
highlighted, but it's cursor remains hollow.  There is now no way to
direct keypresses into the xterm!  Even clicking in the window doesn't
help.  Clicks on the frame do the Right Thing, so obviously fvwm
thinks the window has focus, but the xterm does not.

There are some really weird focus problems going on here.  I hope my
recipe makes sense.  I wonder if any of these are related to the
general problem of XEmacs sometimes losing focus after a frame delete?
You know about this problem right?

Well, thanks for listening!

  After adding options to the source code of an xsysstats to accept
different resource names (I didn't expect to do that!), I have finally
gotten them to be swallowed in an FvwmButtons module.  However, since I'm
using a symbolic link to FvwmButtons to add another pseudo-module, the all
the xsysstats except one (of 3) are being covered up (FvwmButtons only
resizes to allow for 1 of these process, not two).  Is there *any* way to
force a resize of FvwmButtons.  Naturally, I have the perfGeomety defined
to what I would like, but only location is obeyed.  Any suggestions?

I am not   sure I understand  your  problem, but  I did have  problems
swallowing xsysstats into FvwmButtons, until I realized that xsysstats
has a minimum size that it can be resized  to.  If you don't configure
FvwmButtons to provide  at least  the minimum  size, if  won't swallow
xsysstats.

Here is what I got to work:

# I force the height to 64 because xsysstats needs that as a minimum...dje

*FvwmButtons(2x1, Size 64 64, Swallow "XSysStats" 'Exec xsysstats -hidelabels -sample 10 -bg gray -fg black -type disk -color blue -type packets -color darkgreen -type cpu -color red')

That's because the examples use 'fvwm -f "<ModuleName> blah"'. 
fvwm2.0.43 uses the '-cmd' option instead. see the ChangeLog:

       22. Changed behavior of '-f' to just specify config file (now use
           -cmd to perform an actual command, like -cmd 'FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc')

So fvwm tried to interpret the binary as a script.

Help, i have tried to compile fvwm2 on my system, Slackware with kernel 
1.3.18 and get no fvwm2 bin in /usr/bin/X11. I have even renamed the 
"#define fvwm" sections in configure.h to fvwm3 so it then has to build a 
bin called fvwm2, alas this still does not work. 
All the modules seem to get built OK.

If the question has been asked before i am sorry, new to the list.

Thanks in advance.

Simon Doyle.

I'm running FVWM v2.0.40 or maybe 2.0.42 (I don't think that
it matters to the question) ...

I've had trouble with the "Wait" command in the InitFunction.
Specifically, there are some windows for which I just can't find
an appropriate "Wait" string.

So, two questions really:

1. How do I find the right string to apply to a "Wait"?
2. If I can't find such a string, is there a "Pause for N seconds"
   directive that I can put in to the InitFunction in place of
   the "Wait string" command?

Please respond via e-mail to me, and I'll summarize to the mail
list.  My apologies for that.

Thanks!
