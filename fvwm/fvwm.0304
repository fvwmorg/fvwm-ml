I am not sure, what is the problem? If you use 2.5.x (that supports png
with alpha channel), it will just work as expected. Define any background
you want, see the FvwmButtons man page, and then your png will be applied
to this background (image, gradient or solid color). Try in FvwmConsole:

  *FvwmButtons-TransExample: (Icon /your/transparent.png, Title "OK")
  Module FvwmButtons FvwmButtons-TransExample

Or maybe you need to make FvwmButtons itself transparent? Then you may
use colorsets, see the COLORSETS section in the fvwm man page. In this
case you will also want:

  Style FvwmButtons ParentalRelativity

Mikhael.

This depends on:

  * MenuStyle * TrianglesSolid or TrianglesRelief
  * "bg" of your menu item
  * whether you use colorsets or not; you may define "hi" (highlighted)
    and "sh" (shadowed) colors if the ones evaluated from "bg" is not
    what you mean

The colors of the triangle are "hi" and "sh" if TrianglesRelief is
used and simply "hi" if TrianglesSolid is used.

Mikhael.

  I used to have the side button on logitech mouse reserved for 'whole 
window' operations (click = raise/lower, drag = move, drag with window 
key = resize)

  another way: find right click in title and drag tobe useful for resizing.

  having to hit the borders is pretty annoying... even more so when you 
have auto-raise:-)

Hey list,

how can i get a transparent pager? I know that it works as i have seen
it on some screenshots, i tried a few things (transparent colorsets) but
i don't get the bend... Probably it's a problem that my pager is in
FvwmButton? My version is 2.5.6

Looking forward for some help!

Mario

Ouch. Of course, I find even aiming at title bars annoying. WHich is one

You start FvwmTheme here for the first time.
In 2.5.x you don't need it (i.e. remove this line).

Don't use WindowFont, see the man page.

There is no such style RootTransparent.

You start it here for the second time.

Do you want xv and fvwm-root to be run twice on restarts?
Remove ReStartFunction function.

Well, is not it nice to be consistent and use colon-space here too? :)

I try that and it works for normal pager, but not for pager in
FvwmButton?! Is it possible to get tranperancy there?

You should make FvwmButtons transparent too using the similar technology.

Oh, my FvwmButtons is already tranparent, therefor i also want the pager

I did understand you (although it is not what you originally wrote)
and suggested to use colorsets and to read the corresponding man pages.

Please see another message to this list where I give a transparent
FvwmButtons configuration.

By title do you mean "title text" or "titlebar rectangle"?

If text, you may try using MultiPixmap in 2.5.x and specify RightEnd
(but I don't think it will work very well).

If you mean to make the whole titlebar shorter than the window width,
it is not currently possible.

oh, it is title text,
but i dont use a multipixmap, i'd like a multivector xD.

+ TitleStyle ActiveUp Vector 5 51x20@0 98x20@0 98x80@1 51x80@1 51x20@0
and when the title text of my windows is large i'd like that my vetor
title is more short, then it must have a multivector, it don't?
is there another option in fvwm for this?

thanks,

No, sorry, not currently. Nothing except for MultiPixmap works with the
actual text length.

I am going to rename MultiPixmap to Multi or MultiFace anyway, so maybe
in the future someone will add a support for Vector to it (what you call
multivector). Currently you should use transparent images for this.

See http://www.netspace.net.au/~rossh/fvwm-bug/description.html
to get an idea how to replace Vector with alpha-blended png.

Mikhael.

I'm trying to start a new little the for my own use.
(see attached example of an active bar)

As you can see, I have issues with borders.  I can see the border color
between buttons and that's ugly !  How can I remove that ?  I see on this
list that some people are resizing the window without border.  How it is
possible ?  (except select the resize function and then click on the window
you want to resize)

You can see I also have problem with my font title.  How can I remove it ?
It is possible to have special effect in the font ? (like shadow of this
kind of things)

In this theme, I want to use transparency, but I have also some problem.
I have 

colorset 77 fg white, Transparent

and my pager and my iconman are transparent, thx to :

*FvwmPager: Colorset * 77

but I can't have the same for FvwmButton.  I want also to have a tinted
transparent for the active desktop in the pager, I see this on the
screenshot.

Thx for help

If someone is interested, I will publish my theme

Ploum

There is no relable way to know for me whether you are subscribed or not
unless you state this explicitely in every message, so, yes, it is the
practice here to reply to the one who asks. You may configure procmail to
avoid duplicates.

If you use one of the mailers that supports Mail-Followup-To: header, you
can configure it to not include your address in replies. Then others with
a good mailer (like me) will use "group reply" and this will only use the
list address.

I don't know whether your mailer (Gnus v5.9.0) supports Mail-Followup-To,
mutt does using 'subscribe' option.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

I have a fvwmbutton :

*FvwmButtons: (Icon menu/music.xpm \
                Panel(position top,right,delay 0,UseOld,NoClose) \
                "Zinf")


Like this, the button hide/unhide the zinf window.

Is it possible to:

- Hide/Unhide 2 windows ? (XMMS _AND_ Xmms playlist)
- Launch the programm on click if it i not launched

Also about FvwmButton, is it possible that FvwmButton Hide/Unhide some
others buttons ?  And is it possible to have different action for right
click and middle click ?

Thx a lot..

Ploum

  ButtonStyle All -- flat

  Mouse 2 M WSFT MoveOrRaiseLower

  DestroyFunc MoveOrRaiseLower
  AddToFunc   MoveOrRaiseLower
  + M Move
  + H Move
  + C RaiseLower

Then press Alt together with a middle mouse button inside a window
to move it or raise/lower.

Make a font smaller. Or use TitleStyle Height or MinHeight, see the man
page.

Yes, search for 'FONT' sections in the man page.

You may want to define bg here (and maybe sh, hi) too, unless you use
everything flat.

Did you try a solution posted in another thread?

You should add Tint and similar options to Colorset definition.
See the COLORSETS section in the fvwm man page. Something like:

  Colorset 51 Transparent, Tint green 10, bgTint cyan 20

> If someone is interested, I will publish my theme

Preferably in fvwm-themes format, ready to use with one click.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You may create a subpanel (FvwmButtons) that swallows 2 windows
and then hide/show this subpanel.

> - Launch the programm on click if it i not launched

Yes, use:

  None (MyLovelyProgram) Exec exec myloveprg

See also FAQ #7.12.

> Also about FvwmButton, is it possible that FvwmButton Hide/Unhide some
> others buttons ?

No.

But you may create a new configuration dynamically, stop the current
FvwmButtons and start a new version. You may create a shell/perl script
that writes all these commands and then PipeRead it.

> And is it possible to have different action for right
> click and middle click ?

Yes, see the FvwmButtons man page for Action.

Mikhael.

Thx for your detailled reply.  It's very helpful, I will try all your
suggestions.  But here, all my buttons are flat and that doesn't change
anything !

To be sure, I put your line at the end of my config file, without success..
I still have borders between buttons...

You use 10x13 buttons, so there are holes. Either try

  ButtonStyle All -- UseTitleStyle

or use 13x13 buttons.

Hi,

I try to make a theme for fvwm who is like "AquaX" for gtk-2.0
http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/aquax-gtk2/

http://images.freshmeat.net/screenshots/31431.png

Can you help me to have some png used in the title bar of the screenshot ?
(it's not from AquaX, I think it's a gnome theme but I don't know anything
about gnome theme...). Oh yes, I can take from the screenshot, but the Jpg
artefact is ugly.

Otherwise, I would like to know if it is possible to have "round corners"
like in the screenshot ?

And, last question, is it possible to have, in the title bar, a title
bigger than the bar-height.  (Ok, it is not clear, but think of Keramik...
An active window has his title bigger than the rest).  I don't think it is
currently possible, but I ask to be sure...

Thx

Ploum

Why don't you just download a tarball and get images.
Of course some images should be spliced, but some are ready to use.

Or get the images from fvwm-themes, OSX theme.

No, it is not possible.

You can't currently have different font/title-height/border-width for
active and inactive windows. But you may try to have different
RightOfText/UnderText/LeftOfText images to create a similar effect.

Hello list,

first thank you for the wonderful help the last days!

And the another horrible fvwm-newbie-question ... how to resize a window
with the keyboard in small steps. I think on "C-KP_End" for making it
larger to bottom and left and "S-KP_End" for making it smaller. I found
out how to adjust size in absolute manner but not how to it in small
steps?! I'm sure it stands in the man before my nose but i can't work it
out ... fvwm is a bit overwhelming but i hope it gets better after a
while (just like emacs... :)

Mario

Hi all..  forgive me for asking this, but I saw a
screen shot of fvwm and it had something running
in the lower left corner of the screen. I have
never seen it before and I was hoping someone
might be able to tell me what it is called. It
looks like a neet pager/utility bar..

the link to the screen shot is

Thanks!

Jim

That's an FvwmButtons with (from left to right): A bunch of other
buttons, FvwmPager, FvwmWinList, xclock, and xsysinfo (I think.  My
version of xsysinfo looks a lot different, but I know that a similarly
named utility used to look just like what's in the screenshot a few
years back.)

I can't remember if FvwmButtons wants all the rows to be of equal height
or not, and if it does then there's a bit more going on for the leftmost
part.  Otherwise, it's just 3 rows of buttons.

I've always had problems using PNG icons in FVWM, despite configuring 
make to support PNG on my Sun Solaris 2.7 system.  Here's the error 
output to FvwmConsole.


*FvwmConsole version 2.5.6
[FVWM][GetIconFromFile]: <<ERROR>> Failed to load 
/lsi/home/bsferraz/bin/fvwm-icons/konsole.png


The PNG file clearly exists there, and I've correctly added that 
directory to the ImagePath in my .fvwm2rc file and have no problems 
loading XPM pixmaps from that same directory.

When I use fvwm-configure to check that I indeed built in PNG support, I 
get the following output.


% fvwm-config --supports
gettext
gtk
perllib
png
readline
shape
shm
sm
xpm


So it appears that I've successfully added PNG support (using 
libpng-1.2.5), yet I cannot view the PNG icon in FVWM.  I have no 
problems viewing the same PNG using GIMP, and when trying to load in 
other PNGs in FVWM, I get the same error.

Are there other things I can do to nail down the cause of this problem? 
   Are there other users using SPARC-based Solaris that can correctly 
load PNGs with FVWM?  Would using FvwmDebug help?  For whatever reason 
when I try loading the FvwmDebug module in the resource file I'm not 
getting anything.

I appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Ben

It's xosview.

Actually, it is more complex than "3 rows of buttons", you may get its
config from fvwm-themes, Luthien theme.

The best I can think of is:

  Key Home A CM Pick PipeRead `echo Resize $(($[cw.width]-1))p $(($[cw.height]-1))p`
  Key End  A CM Pick PipeRead `echo Resize $(($[cw.width]+1))p $(($[cw.height]+1))p`

Works ok for normal applications, but not for xterm or others that define
resize step other than 1. I.e. Ctrl-Alt-Home works, but not Ctrl-Alt-End.
And this only works in 2.5.x, since in 2.4 there are only $[w.width]
variables and Resize has no "frame" parameter.

If you really want to fix this, you may use
`PipeRead ... xwininfo -id $w -size ...` and parse the geometry in client
units, but this is not effective. I would write a simple module in perl.

Probably we need more expanding variables to handle this situation,
like $[w.unitwidth]. Or make Resize handle "keep+1c" syntax.

Of course, you may create separate key bindings for xterm that increment
in +-7 +-13 or similar. See also ResizeMove command.

Hi all,

I know this is not valid FVWM syntax but it shows what I'm trying to do:

*FvwmButtons: Fore `cat HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f3`
*FvwmButtons: Back `cat HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f2`

DeePBLue>> cat ~/.fvwmColors    
violetred4 yellow darkcyan antiquewhite

What's the best way to get this behaviour? I tried using a PipeRead:

PipeRead 'if [ -r $HOME/.fvwmColors ] ; then \
			fg=`cat $HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f3 -d" "` \
			bg=`cat $HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f4 -d" "` \
		else \
			fg=AntiqueWhite \
			bg=RoyalBlue \
		fi; \
		echo "*FvwmButtons: Fore $fg"; \
		echo "*FvwmButtons: Back $bg"'

But if I put this PipeRead command in a file (say 'testPR') & do a:

Read testPR

from FvwmForm-Talk I get this error message:

sh: -c: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file

Any help/pointers greatly appreciated.

SCoTTie! :)

Work from something simpler up to what you need.

As one line, I got the else clause to work like this:

PipeRead 'if [ -r $HOME/.fvwmColors ] ; then  fg=`cat $HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f3 -d" "`; bg=`cat $HOME/.fvwmColors | cut -f4 -d" "`; else fg=AntiqueWhite bg=RoyalBlue;  fi; echo "echo *FvwmButtons: Fore $fg"; echo "echo *FvwmButtons: Back $bg"'

Watch the semicolons.

I didn't test too carefully, to leave you some fun.

And I didn't remember to remove the echos I stuck in there for testing
either.

The best way is to use colorsets, of course.

  Colorset 10 fg AntiqueWhite, bg RoyalBlue
  *FvwmButtons: Colorset 10

This way you may change the colors of FvwmButtons on the fly without
restarting it, and reuse the same colors in other places.

  Colorset 10 fg yellow, bg darknavy

I would do something like this to solve you problem:

SetEnv COLOR_FILE $[HOME]/.fvwmColors
PipeRead "test -r $[COLOR_FILE] && echo Colorset 10 fg `awk '{ print $3 }' $[COLOR_FILE]`, bg `awk '{ print $4 }' $[COLOR_FILE]`"

Mikhael.

Hello,

several years ago I used fvwm1. Now I decided to give fvwm2 a try
and have a lot of questions :-)

Is there a possibility to make it look like fvwm1?

Especially the window frame seems to have changed (additional colored
line, different colors). You can take a look at
"http://www.alsdorf-online.de/fvwm/" for the difference.

Second, is it possible to change the color for inactive sticky windows
instead of changing the title bar to "StippledTitle" (old
StickyBackColor command). I've already tried to do it by changing the
style, when changing to/from sticky. Unfortunately I didn't succeed.

I changed my WindowListFunc to...
DestroyFunc WindowListFunc
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ I WindowId $0 Raise
+ I WindowId $0 FlipFocus

... and added a Key:
Key F7  A       M       Next (AcceptsFocus,CurrentPage) SwitchToApp
AddToFunc SwitchToApp
+ I     Focus
+ I     Raise

Pressing Alt-F7 raises and focusses the next window (desired effect).
When selecting a window using the WindowList the window raises, but it
is not focussed, unless the mouse pointer is in the root window or by
accident in the selected window. How can I change the
function/WindowList to behave similar to pressing Alt-F7?
I don't want to use WarpToWindow, because I don't like the mouse pointer

You can get my current config file from

Thanks in advance.

You can't change the 3d effect of a window border, it is hardcoded.
But you may try to adjust other things. I used:

  TitleStyle Simple  # not really needed unless you want to change decors
  TitleStyle Centered Height 18
  ButtonStyle 1 5 23x40@1 23x60@1 77x60@0 77x40@0 23x40@1

  Colorset 1 fg black, bg rgb:5f/9f/bf, hi rgb:87/e0/f8, sh rgb:2f/4f/5f
  Colorset 2 fg black, bg rgb:bf/5f/6f, hi rgb:f8/87/97, sh rgb:5f/2f/37

  Style * Colorset 1, HilightColorset 2
  Style * BorderColorset 1, HilightBorderColorset 2
  Style * BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 5
  Style * Font -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

It looks the most closer to your "old" screenshot that I may think of.

No, currently it is not generally possible.

You should either use WarpToWindow or ClickToFocus.
If you use SloppyFocus you explicitely request the window under cursor to
receive a focus, this is what happens. Try "WarpToWindow 50 10p".

BTW, in 2.5.x it works like you want, i.e. another window than the one
under cursor is focussed until you leave/enter a window. I don't know
whether this is an indended behaviour. One may like or hate this.

Thanks for the quick answer and the config options! This looks great and
to my mind more harmonicly.

Actually this is more consistent behaviour, as using "Key"s or the
module FvwmEvent (see FAQ 3.18) both behave this way. Well, I would like
it :-). 

For those who are interested: an updated config file can be grabbed from
"http://www.alsdorf-online.de/fvwm/fvwm2rc-2".

Ah, thanks.

Incidentally, I had to convert the `cat ...` syntax to $(cat ...)
to get it to work with FvwmM4 preprocessing.

SCoTTie! :)

Ah, thanks. Been playing with this all morning - nice feature. I
couldn't use Colorsets with TitleStyle though. No biggie, I can still
change the TitleStyle dynamically anyway.

This is possible in the latest 2.5.x releases.

I've been having some trouble getting MultiPixmap working. I've been
trying to get my title bars to look like a theme I found for IceWM.
The title bar looks like this one image to the left and right of the
title bar buttons and then one image stretched (or tiled) across the
rest. I've attached what it looks like under IceWM, now how do I get
this working. Also, is it possible to get my borders to look _exactly_
like that image? Thanks.

I'm interested in setting up titlebars in FVWM with a
configuration similar to the "SqueezeTitle"
configuration in windows managers like vtwm, ctwm,
etc. -- i.e., a titlebar which only encompasses the
text of the title but doesn't necessarily run the
whole length of the window.  wm2 also has something
along these lines -- nice for minimizing consumption
of available screen space.

However, after searching the 2.4.x documentation to no
avail, I tried installing yesterday's 2.5.7 snapshot
(nice vertical titlebar option...). I read through the
2.5.7 documentation, but came to the conclusion that
either it simply isn't possible to do this with FVWM
or else I needed some outside advice (I'm guessing
regarding MultiPixmap option or Colorsets
w/Transparency for TitleStyle?).

Apologies if the answer to this is buried in the
mailing list archives somewhere. I tried looking
through the few most recent months of material.

Thanks for your time and help...

Alan

Squeezed titles are not currently possible.

Sorry, here's the attachment. Also someone noted that it'd be helpful if
I gave the configuration I'm using now. But I only tried getting this to
working for a few hours, I scrapped it and gave up. So I really don't have
any config snippets to post, I'm just interested in getting MultiPixmap
to work. I don't need any help getting the buttons to work (I've got
that far). Just the two images on each side of the buttons and the one
image that is stretched (or tiled) across rest of the title bar. Thanks.

I've found it helpful to invoke FvwmM4 with

    -m4-squote {{ -m4-equote }}

to avoid collisions with shell syntax in PipeReads.

Running 2.4.7 on Solaris.

The handling of "MWM_FUNC_CLOSE", in the case where it is turned off,
differs among (non-mwm) window managers.  Some remove (or dim) the "Close"
button in the titlebar (if one is defined), as if compensating for the fact
that there is no such thing as "MWM_DECOR_CLOSE" that would permit the Motif
GUI developer to hide it programmatically.

Our configuration is set up to maximally support Motif apps; i.e.,

Emulate Mwm
Style * MwmFunctions
Style * MwmDecor
Style * NoOverride

The 2.4.7 release appears to make a strict distinction between function and
decoration hints.  An application that has MWM_FUNC_CLOSE disabled will have
a visible "Close" button that simply beeps when clicked.  If a Motif GUI
developer wishes to hide the "Close" button, he must also add a "Style
<class> NoButton <n>" to the configuration.  

My question is this:  Does the latest stable release handle MWM_FUNC_CLOSE
differently, perhaps obviating the need for the "NoButton"?  (I see that
some Mwm hints work was done for 2.4.9.)

Regards,
Gregg Dameron

Hello,

I was wondering if it's possible to put an application which doesn't
accept geometry parameters in a fixed location. I found a module
FvwmPlacement which claims to do this, but thought it was strange that
this feature is not in the standard FVWM distribution. Is there another
way ?

thanks,
Remko

Hi all, I can't get FvwmEvent to play sounds..

here's what I am trying to do:

# play sounds
Module FvwmEvent SoundEvent
*FvwmEvent: Cmd Exec /usr/bin/rplay
*FvwmEvent: new_page ~/sounds/new_page.au
*FvwmEvent: new_desk ~/sounds/new_page.au


I have verified that typing /usr/bin/rplay ~/sounds/new_page.au does in fact
play a sound, but when I switch between pages - no sound.

help?


Jim

You need to install Gtk 1.x.

I believe it will coexist with Gtk2.

This message is a little misleading, what it means is:

GTK > 1.1.0 < 2.x.

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to modify my .fvwm2rc to get this mousepointer behaviour: 

- when I call a menu from the root window with a key combo, the
  mousepointer should not warp to the first menu item

- when I go through a menu with the keyboard, the mousepointer should
  not follow the selected menu item

The manpage wasn't my friend, can anyone tell me how to do this? TIA!

A suggestion with regard to the call for a new logo,

  http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~uwp/fvwm-web/logo-competition/rules.php

I _highly_ suggest trying to get a few people from 'deviantart'
interested (the site is rampant with great artists and some
wonderful samples of top-rate past work).  I tried to find the
required procedure to start a new "contest", but failed to find
any info (do please post your findings here if you are more
successful).  I wasn't sure where/what I was supposed to post
on deviantart to get the ball rolling,

  http://www.deviantart.com
  http://gallery.deviantart.com/contest

For that matter there are plenty of people on that site that deal
with "themes" as well that ought to get tapped into ;-)

  http://gallery.deviantart.com/theme

Hope that helps.

 - Nadim

Nadim, thank you for a suggestion, but we did not even announced a
logo competition yet, not to speak about the not ready web pages. :-)

This is probably a good thing to do later, but currently no
deviantart.com link works for me (either 404 or an empty page).

Mikhael.

Hi, I put the "Exec /usr/bin/rplay" in quotes but still nothing. I think there is a larger
issue here. I can't figure out where the Module FvwmEvent should go or
what the syntax is for loading it. But all the example .fvwm2rc I have looked
at shows exactly what I have (below)
I have even tried preceeding it with AddToFunc InitFunction.

Thanks!


Jim

  Hi,

   I'm trying to use gnome and fvwm , and gnome opens a background on my 
background, or in a big separate window.

   Does anybody know if I can make gnome leave my background alone ?

  I would like the panels and icons and such ... but it messes 
everything up when I try to run a gnome app ...

  / regards, Lars Segerlund.

Hello,

   I'm trying to do dynamic popup menus, dependent on the desktop 
number I'm on. It looks something like

Key F10  A  A  DynMenu

AddToFunc DynMenu
+ I Popup My$$d

So, I have 10 desktops and My0,My1 etc. Thing is, that I have 
"normal" popup menus, say, named remote-logins, which is the same 
as My4. Can I do 'alias' or something like this, not to duplicate 
my menu entries and also not to use mystic MySomeNumber name in 
RootMenu and elsewhere? I'm using fvwm 2.5.5 .

Hi all,
   at the bottom of the man page for fvwm, there
is a listing of audio events that begins like so:


e.g. for audio-events:

        *FvwmEvent: startup TaDa.au
        *FvwmEvent: shutdown Elvis_Left.au

        . . .


My Q is: is this a complete list of all fvwm
events?
If it isn't, where could I find such a list?

thanks!

Jim

Hello,
I recently upgrades to red hat Linux 9.0. THe best FVWN i got was for 
red hat 7.3. I did the rpm and all that. Which command says thar FVWM2 
is installed. But I can't swith from Gnome to FVWM2. I deleted .xinitrc 
and .xsession and ammended it to contain FVWM2. Nothing seems to help.

Is FVWM not supported by red hat 9? Any one had anyluck?

Ayan

The pointer only moves when it has to.  Otherwise the menu is brought
up under the pointer.  Are your menus very tall?

If the pointer is moved, its returned to its original location.

I don't think you can change this.

As far as I can tell, the pointer is always moved.  The pointer is
always moved back afterwards, and I sometimes dislike this behavior
(I'll occasionally do M-tab to bring up a WindowList and move my mouse
somewhere else at the same time, only to have it snap back when I
release meta.)  Ditto on below.

I haven't found a way to do this either, although it's a feature I'd
like to see some day.  It's just a minor annoyance to me personally,
nothing major.

That's correct, only when the menu is too long to be shown completely 
with the first element on the current position of the mouse (i.e. the 
pointer is somewhere low in the screen layout), the mouse warps. But 
IMO even then it doesn't _have_ to move, I would like it to stay where 
it is.

OK, thanks. I agree with Ben Winslow, it's not a big deal. But the 
current mouse behaviour is IMO a bit 'nervous'.

Hi,

I use fvwm2 with configuration such winxx. For example:

...
ButtonStyle 1   MiniIcon -- UseTitleStyle flat
ButtonStyle 2   Pixmap mini.winXX-close.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
ButtonStyle 4   Pixmap mini.winXX-maximize.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
ButtonStyle 6   Pixmap mini.winXX-minimize.xpm -- UseTitleStyle flat
...


Normal windows has three buttons right 2 4 6 and one left. 
But transient window has only one button right, number 6, but it is button 
minimize, not close. It has left button 1, too.

With default settings fvwm2 transient window has only button 1 left, and 
no buttons right. How can I set buttons for transient windows?

thanks

Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to alias menus.

But you may do the following to avoid duplication:

  AddToFunc CreateRemoteShellsMenu
  + I DestroyMenu $0
  + I AddToMenu   $0
  + I + "@menu/terminal-remote.xpm@rytas" Exec ssh ...
  + I + "@menu/terminal-remote.xpm@vakaras" Exec telnet ...
  + I + ...

  CreateRemoteShellsMenu RemoteShells
  CreateRemoteShellsMenu My3

You may use rpms linked on fvwm.org. Should work on RedHat 7, 8, 9.

Do you boot your machine immediatelly into X?
If no (i.e. you use startx or xinit to run X), you may create ~/.xinitrc
script and chmod +x it, and it will be called.

There are other ways. Try to run switchdesk, it has "FVWM" as an option
if you have the old RH rpm installed, this should create ~/.Xclients with
a call to fvwm2.

The XFree86 setup is not principally different on different distributions.
You may always start FVWM.

Mikhael.

This looks nice, but isn't really what I want in this situation. 
Still, I'll use this if everything other fails :) Now I'm 
thinking a little bit different way - name my menus not by 
number, but by desktop names, so I can use menus like 
'MenuRemote' elsewhere. And now I have another problem :)  I have 
DesktopName setup, and:

DestroyFunc DynMenu
AddToFunc DynMenu
+ I Popup Menu$$[desk.name$$d]

This doesn't work :( How can I mix variables (if I can), so 
they'll give me the effect I want?  It's strange, that with 
single '$' I can have $[desk.name1] == Web and get menu popup, 
but I can't do this dynamically..

P.S. Really nice lithuanian :)

I suppose you are speaking about the middle of the FvwmEvent man page.

These are 2 events that are internal to FvwmEvent, noone else knows about
them, FvwmEvent invokes them on its own startup and shutdown.

The exact list depends on the version. The currnet list (35 event) may be
found on http://fvwm.org/ in the developers section.

Or, if you use 2.5.x, run the following to get the complete event list:

  perl -I`fvwm-perllib dir` -MFVWM::EventNames -e 'print "$_\n" foreach @{allEventNames()}'

Just press Esc to cancel Alt-Tab. Probably easier then to involve another
hand to use a mouse.

This is not the problem here.

The syntax here would be $[desk.name$$d] or better yet (in 2.5.6+)
$[desk.name$[desk.n]], note a single dollar is enough here.

The problem is that nothing inside $[] is expanded, i.e. you can't
nest variables. You hovewer may do currently the following:

  # be careful about shell escaping, there are extreme conditions
  DestroyFunc ExpandAndRun
  AddToFunc   ExpandAndRun
  + I PipeRead `echo '$*'`

  DestroyFunc DynMenu
  AddToFunc   DynMenu
  + I ExpandAndRun Popup Menu$$$$[desk.name$[desk.n]]

The plus command converts $$ to $, so ExpandAndRun and shell actually
get only 2 dollars and $[desk.n] is already expanded. Then PipeRead
expands the resulting $[desk.name3].

=--=

This is not the first message about nesting variables, so one option is
to introduce a new command (or prefix if you like) Expand for this.

  DestroyFunc DynMenu
  AddToFunc   DynMenu
  + I Expand Popup Menu$$$$[desk.name$[desk.n]]

Another option is to fix the expanding, so the inner $[] is expanded,
in this case only 2 dollars will be needed. And the third option is to
implement nested variable expansion, in this case one dollar will work
and no additional commands will be needed.

I will do the second option and then either the first or the third.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I don't know why it does not work for you.

The following should work.

Change /etc/inittab to include:

  id:3:initdefault:

Then reboot, login into a virtual terminal and start X yourself using
startx or xinit command. This will surely call your ~/.xinitrc. There
will be no chance GNOME is started unless you do this in your ~/.xinitrc.

Of course there are other ways to achieve this, even in init level 5.

Mikhael.

Firstly make sure what version of fvwm you have installed on your system
with "fvwm -version" command and use "which fvwm" to find it's path.

>From my experiences with recent redhat releases, the easiest way to get
fvwm running happily on redhat 8.0 is to do something similar to what
Mikhael suggested above, but with the following diferences.

Boot to run level 3 console mode and use startx to start gnome normally.
Then open an xterm and using "ps aux" to find the pid of the current
gnome winow manager and kill -9 <pid> to kill it. For some reason
metacity doesn't play nice and I suspect fails to comply with ICCCM
specs. Then You can issue into the xterm a command to start fvwm such
as....

fvwm -replace -f <your-config>

Then using the gnome panel which should still be running you can find
and use the session manager gui to save the session. Log out of X and
change /etc/inttab back to boot to run level 5, reboot, and it should
immediately start fvwm once you have logged in.

Of course you can also use the telinit command (as root of course) to
change run levels instead of editing inittab. Redhat seems to complicate
the startup files unecessarily and confuse new users with an
.Xclients-$HOSTNAME$DISPLAY file and can often ignore standard files
like .xinitrc but I'm not sure why.

Unfortunately the method I just outlined doesn't allow you to use the
switchdesk tool normally so you may have to fiddle a bit to switch back
and forth between fvwm and other window managers.

I did all you said and reached fvwm2. It was the usual default, with
fvwmpager, clock, xbiff etc on the lower right hand corner. But then if
I click the mouse left or right I get no menue, there is a small window
coming but nothing written in it. Is it some problem with fonts? I had
the same problem with redhat 8.0 using Xwin32.

I appreciate all your help.
Thanks

We may only support our rpms, not the ones packaged by RedHat 7.3.
You may ask RedHat for a support.

You may also install the rpms from http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/rpm/ .
If you are new to FVWM and do not have any good .fvwm2rc, install
fvwm-themes too and start fvwm-themes-start instead of fvwm.

If you have problems with fonts in your other applications, try to
change your locale, for example change /etc/sysconfig/i18n to contain
LANG="en_US". If you have problems in fonts used by FVWM, try to install
2.5.x instead of 2.4.x.

In any case, always visit your console where you get the X output and
copy all releant error messages that you see when reporting problems.
And report the version you have by running "fvwm-config --version".
Do not yield.

Regards,
Mikhael.

You should also add the following:

  ButtonStyle 1 - Clear MWMDecorMenu
  ButtonStyle 2 - Clear
  ButtonStyle 4 - Clear MWMDecorMax
  ButtonStyle 6 - Clear MWMDecorMin

Then some transient windows (the ones that requested) will (correctly)
not contain the iconify and maximize buttons. I think it is reasonable to
leave it this way. But if you want to ignore any MWM hints, also add:

  Style * NoFuncHint, NoDecorHint

Then you will always have 4 titlebar buttons on all windows.
As a side effect it also adds a title to windows that you don't want:

  Style xmms MWMDecor
  Style gkrellm MWMDecor

Mikhael.

Hi

I have a problem.
I have focus follow mouse and OpenLook application don't get
focus 
when the mouse pointer enters the window. 
Actually they get the focus but window decorations don't change.
(The window looks unfocused but actually has focus).

Do i need a specia command in my fvwm2rc for this applications 
to behave correctly ?

fvwm version 2.4.11

Thanks

Bye
Calin

The amazing thing! After installing FVWM from the web site you mentioned 
with fvwm-themes, it works fine from run level 3. I switched back to run 
level 5 and it pushed me back to GNOME. What could be the reson. The 
.xinitrc file is the same and of course it doesn't read it ar is getting 
over written by some thing. Does that mean that I got to stay in run 
level 3.

hi all,
	I have set up fvwm buttons based on the example in the system.fvwm2rc (debian)

I've added some of my own buttons, and changed the icons to mini.. 
my problem is that mutt doesn't load when I click on the mutt button.

here is my fvwm buttons:

===begin===
Module FvwmButtons DebianFvwmButtons
#
*DebianFvwmButtonsFore White
*DebianFvwmButtonsBack DarkSlateGrey
*DebianFvwmButtonsGeometry 277x56-0-0
*DebianFvwmButtonsRows 1
*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mini.xman.xpm, Action 'Exec exec xman &')
*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mini.xterm.xpm, Action 'Exec exec xterm &')
*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mini.gnu.xpm, Action 'Exec exec emacs &')
*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mutt.mini.xpm, Action 'Exec exec /usr/bin/mutt &')
*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mozilla.mini.xpm, Action 'Exec exec mozilla &')
*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "xclock")
*DebianFvwmButtons(2x1, Swallow(UseOld,NoKill) "FvwmPager")
===end===


everything work but mutt. 
Mutt does work from the fvwm menu and from bash.

what did I do wrong?

thanks!!

Jim

Since mutt is a terminal application, you need to run it inside a
terminal.  Try something like:

*DebianFvwmButtons( Icon mutt.mini.xpm, Action 'Exec exec xterm -e
/usr/bin/mutt &')

Cheers,

Which versions of gnome and fvwm do you use?

gnome2.2 and fvwm2.5.6 works perfectly here.

Yes, as far as I know, Motif distincts between function hints and
decoration hints.
So, function hints determine which functions are permitted on a window and
decoration hints which window decorations are visible.

And MWM doesn't have a close button, so probably there is no Motif hint to
turn off the close button.

But, I suppose EWMH might define such an hint.
I'm not sure, since I don't have a close button in my FVWM...

Hi,

Mouse 5      A    M    Exec aumix -v-1

This makes fvwm pass the button press to the window below.
But changing the Exec to a window operation like the one below
doesn't pass the click:

Mouse 5      A    M    Raise

The problem (besides the discrepancy) is that I don't want the window
under the pointer to receive those button events.

chmurka:$ fvwm -version
FVWM version 2.4.15 compiled on Mar 23 2003 at 00:20:25

I use SloppyFocus.

Any ideas?

Regards,
Piotr

Hi,

I'm using Rox filer as file manager.  http://rox.sourceforge.net

But I'm start rox with a terminal, because it doesn't work in fvwm !

I simply put an entry "Exec exec rox" in my menu. I try again with "rox
-n" and "xterm -e rox"(really bad but ...).
No one works ! ! !  Nothing happens !

What's the matter with this application ?

thx

Ploum

No it doesn't.  It makes Fvwm execute aumix passing the arguments -v-1.
The window under the pointer should not be affected.

Right, Fvwm gets the click and raises the window.

I probably don't understand the problem.
You might want to try to explain it again.

I try it.

It's better because it works if another rox window is open.
If not, nothing happens !  What's the deal with this software ?

I read all the thread, but I don't learn more than the nohup option.

Thx anyway

I haven't looked at the source code, but I believe its
trying to figure out if its invoked from a tty.

Maybe you should contact the author.

Usually in runlevel 5 (X) .xinitrc file from home
directory is ignored (at least that's the behaviour on my
machine) and instead the contents of .xsession is executed.
The .xsession file _must_ be executable

So:
-- create a file .xsession
 echo fvwm2 >$HOME/.xsession
-- make it executable
 chmod 755 $HOME/.xsession

And it should work.(Works for me :-))
If it doesn't work you must figure out the X startup sequence 
in runlevel 5 (see files in /etc/X11/xdm) which is not an easy
 task _or_ keep looking for an answer to your problem _or_
enjoy runlevel 3 :-)

Indeed, it does. When I scroll the wheel, I get both effects:
1. aumix executes and changes sound volume (this is what I intended to
have);
2. the window under the pointer gets the event and e.g. mozilla (or
whatever happens to be under the pointer) scrolls its contents (this
is not what I wanted to have...

_And_ fvwm doesn't pass the event to the window (contrary to what I
get with the Exec comamnd).

The only window that doesn't get the event in both cases (i.e. with
Exec and Raise) is the root window.

I hope I made a bit more clear.

The event can only go one place or the other.
Are you sure you have the meta key held down during the entire
operation?

If you have xev installed, you might try to use it to figure out
whats happening.

Yes, I understand now, but the mystery remains.

It looks like rox tries to put itself in the background when run
from a terminal.   It has this option:

-n, --new

    start a new filer, even if  one already seems  to be running. This
    also  prevents   the     filer  from  forking   (running  in   the
    background). This option is mainly useful for debugging.

You might want to use "-n" to start the first one, or make sure there aren't
any instances currently hanging that might confuse it.

Tried that, doesn't work. Redhat won't read .xsession or .xinitrc or is 
getting over written. How does one knows what it is doing just after it 
starts X?

This might be something. I tried switchdesk and it complains that FVWM 
is not installed.
I know FVWM is installed and was running a moment ago in run level 3.

Do you use gdm (Gnome's display manager) to login? (Redhat does by
default).
You need to choose "xsession" from the menu where you select session typ.
Then you should be able to just login in the future without problem
(atlest it works for me, RH 7.3).

Or you could change to use XDM (if you're root...)
It's at the end of /etc/inittab (there's something like "prefdm", change
that to xdm, but do it your own risk, I guess a backup of that file is 
good idea...)

Great it works.
The switchdesk only knows fvwm, I have fvwm2 and want to start from 
fvwm-themes-start.
How do I teach switch desk to do that?
Another thing, how can I play with the clock?
In good old days it was in the .fvwm2rc :) where it asks some thing to 
swallow the clock. Where is it said these days??

The only thing switchdesk does is creates a file ~/.Xclients that
contains one line, it does nothing else (maybe backups the old one).

Just create this file yourself:

  % echo exec fvwm >~/.Xclients
  % chmod a+x ~/.Xclients

Or:

  % echo exec fvwm-themes-start >~/.Xclients

Decide whether you use .fvwm2rc (start fvwm), or learn how fvwm-themes
works. There is a documentation and mailing lists for fvwm-themes.

Mikhael.

Hi all.. I just noticed a bunch of files in my home directory, some dated april 5 and some dated april 6.

.fs-1Bcg6g  .fs-KIcqgd  .fs-W9Mipb  .fs-ZSId7T  .fs-elA36G  .fs-xCJHn7
.fs-4zloCf  .fs-QYmhbz  .fs-XsXBdJ  .fs-aNDjJU  .fs-mj7eCo
.fs-Iax3Vl  .fs-R7G6ba  .fs-YvMUNE  .fs-cNAFwj  .fs-nkAz1C

I opened some in emacs and at the top of each files it says:

# This file is generated by fvwm. It stores global and window states.
# Normally, you must never delete this file, it will be auto-deleted.


Does anyone know what these are and why they were not deleted? Is it safe for me to delete them?

thanks!

Jim

Hi,

I've gotta few configuration questions that I was hoping somebody could
help me out with. Was using gnome2 for a while, but realized i needed something
more than metacity... will probably converge to fvwm 2.5 + gnome2 eventually..

Anyhow, I'm using 2.4.15 for the moment, and I've got a few things that I'm trying
to do but can't seem to figure out how to do them.

1) Focus when switching pages: When I switch a page, I want the last focused window
on that page (before i left) to be refocused. To do this, I tried to write a function
like:

AddToFunc GotoPageAndFocus
+ I GotoPage $0 $1
+ I Next [CurrentPage] Focus

So that I can say something like

Key Up	C	GotoPageAndFocus +0p -1p

This almost works.. as it switches pages and focuses something, but
unfortunatley it focuses the wrong window. Every time I return the to a
page the "next" window in the page is focused. I can't figure out how to
refer to the former "current" window of that page.


2) Raising when using WindowList: I want to try to replicate sawfish type behaviour in
combination with the windowilst.. is there any way to capture the user moving down
through the list and running commands based on the current selected window (before
the SelectOnRelease fires)?


3) How "unstable" is 2.5.x? Is it like a "its a CVS snapshot so it might
not even compile" type of unstable? or is it a "it mostly works but
there might be a few bugs" kind of stable. I've seen some of the
screenshots of 2.5.x which look quite interesting, plust the EWMH
compatibility, but i also don't want something that I'm gonna have to
fight with all the time. Also, I'm sure lots of people ask and I know
its on the FAQ,etc etc, but is there a ballpark estimate for when 2.6
might be out? (a few months? a few years?) Just helps in trying to make
a decision of whether I should wait and stick with 2.4.x or make the jump.
And if I do make the jump will likely bring an ebuild to the gentoo tree.

4) is there a way to search the ML archive?

Thanks alot. Having lots of fun with the .fvwm2rc.. a bit tedious, but I
guess thats what you get.

Ken

I want something like that too, but don't need badly enough to think
about it myself ... just thinking out loud.

It is rarely unstable.  I have been exclusively using the released
versions of development branch since around 2.5.[23].  Only in 2.5.4
a serious bug cropped up (FvwmPager eating up 100% CPU) which was
fixed very quickly.

Otherwise, other people keep finding problems that do not seem to
affect me; they may elaborate on that part.  Or, just monitor the
fvwm-workers list traffic and see them -- both the people & the
problems -- yourself.

Use your browser's search capabilities.  Try Google (if the right

The commands Next, Current, Prec etc, are called directional
commands. They define a "search direction" for windows. So Current means
"no direction", Next means "forward direction" and so on.
The part within "[]" are conditions that are to be met for a window to
match.
So "Next [CurrentPage]" matches the first window counting "forward" in the
window stack that is on the current page.
Current means the current window in the stack, but if there is also
[CurrentPage] it will only match the current window if it's on the current
page, otherwise no window will match.

The same applies to for example "Raised", "Lowered"

Hi,

I would like to set up a panel that is similar to Gnome's panel or KDE's 
kicker. Some neccessary features that I absolutely need are:
1. A button that shows the applications menu
2. A list of the windows on the current desktop
3. The pager
4. A Clock
5. Autohide

I know that there is FvwmTaskbar and FvwmButtons. But FvwmTaskbar doesn't 
support the pager and FvwmButtons doesn't support autohide.

Any ideas how to forge such a thing?

BTW, I'm willing to upgrade to the latest unstable FVWM version if that's 
neccessary.

Felix

It surprised me too. Maybe it's my XFree? I have Debian's
4.2.1. Unfortunately I don't have any non-debian system with X to
check this.

I recently upgraded from Fvwm 2.2.2.5 to 2.4.14 and then on to 2.5.6.

I notice with the 2.4 and 2.5 versions, that Fvwm loses my command line
arguments over a Restart.  Preprocessing of the fvwmrc file is therefore
incorrect after the restart.

To illustrate, this is what I do.  I invoke fvwm like this:

fvwm2 -cmd "FvwmCpp $HOME/.fvwm2rc -DDPY$DISPSZ=1 ${APM:+-DAPM=1}" &

This will define two Cpp variables: DPYnnnxnnnn and APM.  I then test
these and do appropriate things to the display, based on its size and
whether or not APM power management is in use.  On the first run, this
works fine.

However, after a restart, it seems these arguments are completely lost
as neither variable is set when the fvwmrc file is re-processed.

FWIW, this worked perfectly in 2.2.2.5, even after a restart.

What command do you use to restart?
(The full line from the menu item or keybinding that restarts).

This is from the man page:

              If  you  need  a  native restart, we suggest
              only to use Restart command without  parame=AD
              ters  unless  there  is a reason not to.  If
              you still use an old command 'Restart fvwm2'
              that  was correct in 2.2.x, all current com=AD
              mand line arguments are  lost.   On  Restart
              without parameters or with --pass-args, they
              are preserved.

There are some other details in the man page that may be of interest.

I do think you'll need to use 2.5 for it, though--I don't think
FVWM::Module exists in 2.4.

I don't think there's a way to do this, either, but I'd like to see
something like it.  I often have so many windows on one viewport that
it's very difficult to figure out which I'm actually after by the window
title alone.

I've found 2.5 to be very stable (although I have managed to crash it a
few times, it was always reproducable and ended up being fixed in the
latest CVS tree), but if you're worried about losing everything in your
X session because fvwm crashed (e.g. you exec it from your .xsession),
you might find this shell snippet handy:

At the end of my ~/.xsession, I have:

while [ 1 ]; do
	fvwm
	RET=3D"$?"
	if [ "$RET" =3D 0 -o "$RET" =3D 1 ]; then
		break
	fi
	if [ "$RET" -gt 128 ]; then
		SIGNAL=3D" (signal $((RET - 128))"
	else
		SIGNAL=3D
	fi
	xmessage "fvwm returned with exit code $RET$SIGNAL"
done

This pops up an xmessage if fvwm exits abnormally explaining what
happened and then restarts it.

> 4) is there a way to search the ML archive?
http://www.mail-archive.com/fvwm@hpc.uh.edu/ has a search
form--unfortunately, it doesn't work.  Your best bet is probably google
as parv suggested.

It's the second kind. I've been running 2.5.x fvwms for quite a while now and
they've been very good. They are not random snapshots.

Even CVS is often quite good - I think they developers adhere fairly
well to "don't commit unless the build succeeds" methodology, which
makes using the CVS HEAD checkout at least feasible.

There's LOTS of nice stuff in the 2.5 series - I don't use 2.4 at all and
hope never to have to - I use and like too many of the new features.

The main thing which may bite you is than in 2.5 they feel fairly free
to fiddle the keywords. They tend to keep backwards compatibility to
a degree (lots of nice warnings about "don't use X, use Y instead!"
when you run up an old config with newer FVWM, and often the old keyword
still works anyway, easing transition).

Nice. I'll give that a try. The Perl module stuff seems very interesting
to me... it lets you keep state that the core itself doesnt.. but for me
it leads to the question, how much of the functionality do you implement
in the core and how much in perl (or other external module)? Is there a
philosophy in terms of what goes in and what stays out? Is fvwm going in
the direction of a sawfish that uses perl but with better primitives?

Also how is the performance of the perl module? and can something
simliar be done for other languages (ruby?)

Perhaps there is some way to do it with the perl stuff..

interesting.. i'll have to give that a try.. or perhaps i could
do an automatic respawn if I put it into a gnome session.

This seems to work pretty well, except that if you have ClickToFocus and
ClickToFocusRaises enabled, it only works if you map keyboard events to
GotoPage-like events. In my setup, I use the pager, and when I click on
the pager it gets focus, and because it gets focus, the FvwmButtons
would always be the focused window when I switched around using the
pager,

so my solution was to change all occurances of M_FOCUS_CHANGE in the
perl script to M_RAISE_WINDOW. Then in my .fvwm2rc say:

Style FvwmButtons ClickToFocus, ClickToFocusRaisesOff

so that the window that the perl script tracks will not be over written
just because i clicked in the pager. I suppose another solution would
be to make the script explicity ignore FvwmButtons or FvwmPager focus
events, but that seems like a bit of a hack anyways.. for ClickToFocus
type settings this seems to be reasonable.

----------------

I've managed to get fvwm to load as a part of gnome-session (from
gnome2). I'll describe the procedure here, in case anyone is interested

essentially, in my .xinitrc i say:

export WINDOW_MANAGER="fvwm"

unfortunately, gnome-wm (which is called by gnome-session to start the
wm) doesn't know about fvwm's -i option (as of gnome-session 2.2.1) so
you have to hack gnome-wm and add it in yourself.

If you use the default session, then fvwm will be started in a "restart
on death" type of style, so you won't lose everything when it gets
killed, or when it crashes.

A few problems however:
I can't get the gnome-panel to stay on top, and as it's drawer panels don't
come to the front as well.

Style gnome-panel StaysOnTop 

doesn't work.. what could make a "StaysOnTop" not take effect?

The gnome panel sets the layer itself.  You can try to set

  Style gnome-panel GnomeIgnoreHints

but this disables a lot of other gnome related hints too.  You can
tell the panel to stay on top from its config panel.

So, it does exactly what you request, starts the executable without any
arguments. Either add here command line arguments you need or better yet,
use "Restart" to preserve original arguments.

Also, please always see the X output, you will find useful error messages:

<<WARNING>> `Restart fvwm2' might not do what you want, see the man page.
	Use Restart without parameters if you mean to restart the same WM.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Or better yet mark all windows that should not be focused:

  Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus

Then you may return to M_FOCUS_CHANGE since it is more correct.

The Perl module API is just an alternative to the C module API, nothing
else in the terms of philosophy. It is however more usable for scripting,
since it does not require compiler to run.

Usually you may hardly notice a difference between modules written in C
and in Perl, but this depends on what you actually do.

No, only perl is supported. Theoretically you may implement the FVWM ruby
library similarly to perllib, but it is a lot of work and you should know
some internal FVWM details to do this. Just use perl.

To reduce you an experimentation time, you can't raise windows while
browsing a native menu, because of the way menus currently work.

You can implement it similarly to how FvwmProxy (the current name in cvs,
will be renamed) does it. Say, by opening a window with a window list.
Possibly using FVWM::Module::Gtk. Maybe this will be an optional
functionality of FvwmWindowMenu (a module that uses perllib) one day.

Mikhael.

When you use a session manager (like gnome-session), fvwm stores its
state in a file named like this. This includes for example the current
page, which windows are shaded/iconified/maximized, the geometries of the
windows running and so on. You may have several sessions (currently
active or non active) with fvwm running, so it is difficult to say
whether these files will be still used in the future or not.

Usually such file is removed automatically when a session manager
discards fvwm from a session. But in some (probably abnormal) situations
this file may be not removed. In this case, you may remove it yourself.

BTW, if you use xsm (another session manager) you should define
SESSION_MANAGER_NAME=xsm before running fvwm (or better yet before
running xsm). Otherwise this file will not be removed, because xsm is not
fully conforming and this is a workaround documented in our man page.

Mikhael.

You should use FvwmButtons.

You may implement auto-hide of any window, here is how I just did it for
a fun with my persistent pager (for 2.5.x only):

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-AutoHide: *
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: PassId
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: enter_window AutoUnHide
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: leave_window AutoHide

  DestroyFunc AutoUnHide
  AddToFunc   AutoUnHide
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager-Desker,    Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, Shaded) WindowShade false

  DestroyFunc AutoHide
  AddToFunc   AutoHide
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager-Desker,    !HasPointer) WindowShade true
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, !HasPointer) WindowShade true

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-AutoHide

You may implement a timeout for autohiding too, there were some examples
in the archive using the similar technology and Schedule command.

If you have your panel on the screen bottom (or on the left) use this:

  Style FvwmButtons-MyPanel NoTitle, TitleAtBottom  # or TitleAtLeft

so it shades a window to the corresponding direction, not just to the up.

Mikhael.

You may also use the "EdgeCommand" in version 2.5.x to execute a
function or command if the mouse hits the edge of the screen:

EdgeThickness 1
EdgeCommand
EdgeCommand Right  Next ("FvwmButtons") Focus
EdgeCommand Bottom Next ("FvwmTaskBar") Focus

DestroyFunc AutoLowerFunction
AddToFunc AutoLowerFunction
+ I Current (!FvwmButtons) All (FvwmButtons) Lower
+ I Current (!FvwmTaskBar) All (FvwmTaskBar) Lower

DestroyFunc AutoRaiseFunction
AddToFunc AutoRaiseFunction
+ I Current (FvwmButtons) Raise
+ I Current (FvwmTaskBar) Raise

Style FvwmButtons ClickToFocus
Style FvwmTaskBar ClickToFocus

Module FvwmAuto 100 "Silent AutoRaiseFunction" "Silent AutoLowerFunction"

This has the advantage that the TaskBar nor the Buttons don't need to
be visible.

The disadvantage that makes this setup useless is that a user normally
wants that all special modules, like FvwmButtons, FvwmTaskBar, FvwmPager
are not focusable. I.e. these modules should normally be NeverFocus,
not ClickToFocus.

A much better solution for me would be to hide a window on EdgeCommand
and unhide it on any focus:

  EdgeThickness 1
  EdgeCommand
  EdgeCommand Right Next (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, CirculateHit) UnhideWindow
  EdgeCommand Bottom Next (FvwmTaskBar, CirculateHit) UnhideWindow

  DestroyFunc HideWindow
  AddToFunc   HideWindow
  + I WindowShade true   # or: Lower

  DestroyFunc UnhideWindow
  AddToFunc   UnhideWindow
  + I WindowShade false  # or: Raise

  Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus, NoTitle, TitleAtRight
  Style FvwmTaskBar NeverFocus, NoTitle, TitleAtBottom

  DestroyFunc HideAll
  AddToFunc   HideAll
  + I Next (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, CirculateHit) HideWindow
  + I Next (FvwmTaskBar, CirculateHit) HideWindow

  Module FvwmAuto 100 HideAll

The previous FvwmEvent solution is good too regarding NeverFocus.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Below is the new and official, race condition free, resource
friendly, configurable and extensible way for autohiding.  I will
polish it a bit and put it in the FAQ.  This works with the latest
CVS code only:

  AddToFunc autohide_handler
  + I hide_or_show $0 FvwmButtons 500 W
  #                   ^           ^   ^
  #                   |           |   |___  Shade direction (optional)
  #                   |           |_______  Hide delay
  #                   |___________________  Unique window name/resource

  AddToFunc hide_or_show
  + I WindowId $0 ($1) Deschedule $0
  + I WindowId $0 ($1) ThisWindow (shaded) WindowShade $i3 off
  + I CondCase (!Match) All (!shaded, $1) Schedule $2 $$$$$$$$w WindowShade $3 on

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -passid -menter autohide_handler

Got it.  In fact, I see now that this change is even documented in
the man page!  Sorry for not having rtfm'd!

Well, with this working, my 2.2.2.5 fvwmrc now works perfectly on
2.5.6.  And, 2.5.6 is considerably faster!  Great work folks, and
thank you.

	-jr

You should use FvwmButtons.

You may implement auto-hide of any window, here is how I just did it for
a fun with my persistent pager (for 2.5.x only):

  DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-AutoHide: *
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: PassId
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: enter_window AutoUnHide
  *FvwmEvent-AutoHide: leave_window AutoHide

  DestroyFunc AutoUnHide
  AddToFunc   AutoUnHide
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager-Desker,    Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, Shaded) WindowShade false

  DestroyFunc AutoHide
  AddToFunc   AutoHide
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmPager-Desker,    !HasPointer) WindowShade true
  + I WindowId $0 (FvwmButtons-MyPanel, !HasPointer) WindowShade true

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-AutoHide

You may implement a timeout for autohiding too, there were some examples
in the archive using the similar technology and Schedule command.

If you have your panel on the screen bottom (or on the left) use this:

  Style FvwmButtons-MyPanel NoTitle, TitleAtBottom  # or TitleAtLeft

so it shades a window to the corresponding direction, not just to the up.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello, 

I use Debian/stable and fvwm 2.4. I have trashed the default config 
and created my own one. 

Now I like to have a ButtonBar like in KDE which can be hidden to 
the left or the right. How can I do this ? 

I have a FvwmButtons which is working very well and I have two 
buttons on the left and on the right for hiding, but now ? 

Please Cc: me because I am not on the list (too much traffic for my 
Mobil-Telephone). 

Thanks
Michelle

Hello, 

I have some Multiuser-Systems and running fvwm only without 
GNOME or KDE. System default is 'C'

Now I have User-Settings like

export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE@euro
export LANGUAGE=de_DE@euro
export LANG=de_DE@euro

But I can not use the 'LANG' because fvwm exits every time 
without any error messages. 

        WHY ??? 

This Error occur with ALL possibel settings like tr_TR, 
ar_SY, fs_IR ar_MA and fr_FR@euro...

Thank you for your Help
Michelle

This is nice. Just a note, this requires the latest cvs to run.
I am not quite sure why the number of dollars is 7 instead of 8 here.

Anyway, here is a more short and understandable version of the whole
thing (all functions have one parameter less and only one dollar):

  AddToFunc enter_handler
  + I autohide FvwmTaskBar 500 SW
  #            ^           ^   ^
  #            |           |   |___  Shade direction (optional)
  #            |           |_______  Hide delay
  #            |___________________  Unique window name/resource

  AddToFunc autohide
  + I ThisWindow ($0) Deschedule $[w.id]
  + I ThisWindow ($0, shaded) WindowShade off
  + I Cond (!Match) All ($0, !shaded) autohide_hide $1 $2

  AddToFunc autohide_hide
  + I Deschedule $[w.id]
  + I Schedule $0 $[w.id] WindowShade $1

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -menter enter_handler

The problem addressed in:

http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0112/msg00316.html

and fixed in 2.4.5 is occurring in the latest stable release (2.4.15).  To
summarize:

If:
1.  Dual monitors are in use (non-Xinerama);
2.  FvwmEvent is set up to detect a new window (per FAQ 3.18);
3.  The command "sleep 5 ; xterm &" is entered in a terminal window on the
primary display (:0.0); and
4.  The pointer is manually moved to the secondary display (:0.1) within 5
seconds,

then the pointer will warp to 0,0 of the primary display when the xterm
appears.  The reverse is also true; i.e., if the words "secondary" and
"primary" are exchanged above.

Also, if a Restart is done on one side, then the pointer is quickly moved to
the opposite side, it will warp back to 0,0 of the first side when the
restart completes.  In this case, FvwmEvent need not be running.

Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

Regards,
Gregg Dameron

The Pager in 2.4.15 appears to have a minor bug.

If I have a Motif application with MWM_FUNC_MOVE disabled, and the mwm hint
Style options are in place (no overrides), its miniature in the Pager can
still be moved by dragging it with mouse button 2.  The app window itself
stays put.  A button 2 click on its miniature in the Pager snaps the
miniature back to its original location.

Regards,
Gregg Dameron

P.S.  If it would help, I'd be glad to post the source for a simple mwm hint
testing program I use.

This is possible to fix, but it is a really minor thing to much worry
about.

This is not needed. There is tests/hints/hints_test program in the cvs
that defines all kind of hints (and not just MWM hints).

How are you starting fvwm?  If you are starting fvwm from .xsession,
check ~/.xsession-errors to see if there is any output from fvwm.  If
you're using ~/.xinitrc, check the terminal where you started X.  You
might also check to see if fvwm crashed and left a core file.

My LANG is en_US.UTF-8, and I haven't had any trouble starting fvwm 2.4
or 2.5, although the Debian package of fvwm 2.4 gave me some font issues
(probably because of my UTF-8 locale.)

What does "FvwmAutohide" do? The latest cvs version of the FvwmAuto
man page says only:

Module FvwmAuto Timeout [-passid] [-menter|-menterleave|-mfocus] [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

BTW: Your solution requires that the autohide window is visible, 
     doesn't it?

With 2.5.x, you can shade a window in any direction.  Make a
buttons on the left/right with the actions

  WindowShade W
  WindowShade E

THe buttons will be hidden too, but you can, for example, make a
right click on the window border unshade the window:

  Mouse 3 fs n WindowShade off

With 2.5.x you can also bind a different command on each window
border.  In my config, a double click on any of the eight parts of
the border shades the window in the given direction:

  Mouse 1 [     N   Function ResizeOrRaise W
  Mouse 1 ]     N   Function ResizeOrRaise E
  Mouse 1 -     N   Function ResizeOrRaise N
  Mouse 1 _     N   Function ResizeOrRaise S
  Mouse 1 <     N   Function ResizeOrRaise NW
  Mouse 1 >     N   Function ResizeOrRaise SE
  Mouse 1 ^     N   Function ResizeOrRaise NE
  Mouse 1 v     N   Function ResizeOrRaise SW

  AddToFunc ResizeOrRaise
  + C Raise
  + M Raise
  + M ResizeMaximize
  + D Current (Shaded) Raise
  + D WindowShade $0

This config allows to hide and show *any* window by double
clicking its border, not just FvwmButtons.

You are right, it is a tricky thing currently. Here is what happens.
This parameter is thought as a timeout by FvwmAuto, and since it is not a
number a timeout of 0 is assumed (we do our own timeout using Schedule).
But this "timeout that is not a number" string is not ignored by fvwm,
it uses heuristics and takes it as a module alias.

So you may to have several FvwmAuto running and kill them independently:

  Module FvwmAuto FvwmAuto-Beep -mfocus Beep
  Module FvwmAuto FvwmAuto-Raise -mfocus Raise

  # then after you find the first annoying, kill it only
  KillModule FvwmAuto FvwmAuto-Beep

So currently you may have either a non-zero timeout or an alias, or
FvwmAuto may be enhanced to support both. In the future there will be the
global non-tricky solution for module aliases in the core.

Yes, the Dominik's solution requires that a small frame square of 10x10
(with NoTitle, BorderWidth 5) is visible. Try: "WindowShade NW" on any
window. You may setup this 10x10 pixel frame to be always OnTop.

Mikhael.

Trial and error.  I added dollars until it worked.  Eight works
fine too.

Ah!  I wasn't aware that a window id could be used in conditions.
But you are probably wrong about the number of '$'s because
$[w.id] *is* defined initially, but contains the wrong window.
I'll test that later.  There is still a bug with hiding:  as long
as enter events keep coming in fast enough, hiding will not
trigger.  The Deschedule command in autohide_hide must be
scheduled after the WindowShade command instead of being executed
right away.

That's the module alias syntax.  It starts an FvwmAuto module with
the name FvwmAutohide.

> BTW: Your solution requires that the autohide window is visible, 
>      doesn't it?

Sure.  You can make the window StaysOnTop, so you have no problem
accessing it.  And if you don't like that part of it is always
visible, hide it to a corner of the screen.  Its almost impossible
to notice it there.

At the time the functions are defined using AddToFunc, $[w.id] is not
defined. Of course, if you can't guarantee this, it may be escaped
as $$[w.id], but this is not really needed.

Other than this, since we only use $[w.id] inside ThisWindow condition,
whenever $[w.id] is defined, it is what we want to use as [De]Schedule
parameter. So it works well. With other conditions, like All we would
need many dollars.

I've exhausted myself on this one and I wonder if someone can point me in the 
right direction...

I use SloppyFocus, and I'm prone to zapping FvwmIconMan with my iconify key combo. 
I'd very much like to know how I can write this function so that it won't iconify 
FvwmIconMan if I happen to be above it when I do the key combo.

I iconify windows by doing:

Key Down  A CS  Function shade-iconify

I've tried PointerWindow, WindowId... All-ways, IconMan still zipps off to the 
corner.
This is the func's current state: 

DestroyFunc shade-iconify
AddToFunc   shade-iconify
 + "I" Current (FvwmIconMan) Break
 + "I" Cond (1) Echo "Still here"
 + "I" WarpToWindow 50 -0
 + "I" WindowShade $0 $[mydirection]   # gratuitous, but so purrty ;)
 + "I" Iconify

Hi,

I've installed latest fvwm 2.5.6 and now this is working differently
than older 2.5.2 which I used previously.  When I open new frames from
xemacs new frame gets focus nicely but when close this frame focus
won't go back to the original frame.

I've already tried these
Style * FPGrabFocus, FPReleaseFocus
Style * FPGrabFocusTransient, FPReleaseFocusTransient

This works, but it wrecks my IconMan, which is no good. I navigate my
desktop using FvwmIconMan and arrow keys - I have certain menus bound to
FvwmIconMan.  It's the "control center" of my desktop; it keeps my hands
mouse free, which is why it distresses me so when I accidentally keep
CTL+Shift pressed when I'm there and iconify it.  I need to be able to
focus FvwmIconMan, frequently. What I'd like is to have a switch that
will recognise FvwmIconMan and break from the iconification function. Is
this doable?

Right, but you removed one WindowId command too many.

  Thiswindow ($0) Thiswindow (shaded)

is *not* equvalent to

  ThisWindow ($0, shaded)

It has a different return code which is needed later.  New version
that takes care of the bug I described.  With any code earlier
than current CVS it immediately crashes because calling Deschedule
from a Schedule command does not work.  With my latest patch it is
more stable but may still crash if the timing is wrong.
Basically, fiddling with the scheduler's queue while traversing
through it can cause core dumps.  I need to revise the code so
that it delays destroying queue items.

  AddToFunc enter_handler
  + I autohide FvwmButtons 500 S
  #            ^           ^   ^
  #            |           |   |___  Shade direction (optional)
  #            |           |_______  Hide delay
  #            |___________________  Unique window name/resource

  AddToFunc autohide
  + I ThisWindow ($0) Deschedule $[w.id]
  + I ThisWindow ($0) ThisWindow (shaded) WindowShade off
  + I Cond (!Match) All ($0, !shaded) autohide_hide $1 $2

  AddToFunc autohide_hide
  + I Schedule $0 $[w.id] WindowShade $1
  + I Schedule $0 $[w.id] Deschedule $[w.id]

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -menter enter_handler

Greeting to everybody,

I have a problem using Ximian Evolution 1.2.4 with Fvwm 2.4.15 (under
FreeBSD 4.8 )

Evolution sets its title as "Fvwm - Ximian Evolution 1.2.4" so the style
commands of the kind "Style Fvwm* ..." affect it beside fvwm modules.
The style commands I actually use are the following:

Style *         HilightFore black, HilightBack grey
Style *         BorderWidth 1, HandleWidth 2
Style *		NoIcon
Style *         MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style *         DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style *         FocusFollowsMouse
Style *         TileCascadePlacement
Style "Fvwm*"       NoTitle,  Sticky, WindowListSkip
Style "Fvwm*"       CirculateSkipIcon, CirculateSkip
Style "FvwmPager"   StaysOnTop, BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0
Style "FvwmBanner"  StaysOnTop

I added the line

Style "*Evolution*" Title, Slippery, WindowListHit, CirculateHitIcon , \
CirculateHit, StaysPut

To revert to the previous settings, but in fact it doesn't work
perfectly : the windows is still sticky (maybe Slippery isn't correct?),
and the title bar isn't drawn in the same way all the others are.

Anyway it wouldn't be the ideal solution, because every change to the
modules settings will require to update Evolution line (and they could
be also redundant so in fact I wouldn't have to revert them !).
Is there a way (beside explicity naming all the modules) I could exclude
Evolution from the Fvwm* pattern(or any other solution) ?

Thanks in advance,
Marco Righele

To be more precise, I must say that this doesn't always happen, just
when the last folder I used in my mail client is the one of this mailing
list (called Fvwm) , so when opening the client the name the window
manager sees begins with Fvwm.
Well, thinking about it... maybe the best solution is just to rename the
folder to 'fvwm' :-D; anyway any reply will be appreciated (still have
to understand why evolution remains sticky)

FVWM will crash? Then as an end user which of the many proposed solutions 
should I take in order to get autohiding to work reliably? I'm willing to 
upgrade to the CVS version if that's reasonably stable.

You may use a solution that does not use Schedule command.

I didn't notice any crash when tried a solution with Schedule.
It probably depends on your CPU and other factors.

The today's cvs fixed some bugs found with Schedule.

It is your choice now.

Mikhael.

In 2.5.x if you don't know the opposite name, you may just use:

  Style "*Evolution*" !Sticky

> and the title bar isn't drawn in the same way all the others are.

I suppose you mean the difference is only stipples. If no, explain.

I think "Fvwm*" pattern is too vague. You may just list all 3-10 modules
that you use in separate lines. I myself use some modules that should be
Sticky and some that should be Slippery, some NoTitle and some Title,
some CirculateSkip and some CirculateHit and so on, so "Fvwm*" is not
really good for me. Maybe in the future the planned "Style (Class Fvwm*)"
will be implemented, so your window will not even match it.

As for your problem. If you issue RecaptureWindow on Evolution, does your
window is still sticky? If yes, your Style lines define it to be Sticky,
fix this by verifying the Style list again and using FvwmIdent. If after
Recapture the window is not Sticky anymore, this means that the initial
name of the window matches some pattern that is configured to be Sticky
and it is probably not "*Evolution*".

If you run 2.5.x I would think about a possibility that Evolution uses
EWMH sticky hint, but you run 2.4.15. It is possible hovewer that it sets
GNOME sticky hint. Try:

  Style "*Evolution*" GNOMEIgnoreHints  # EWMHIgnoreStateHints

But you say in your another message that it sometimes is not sticky,
so it probably this has nothing to do with hints.

Mikhael.

This works fine for me with FvwmIconMan MouseFocus.
The first thing I thought is to suggest you:

  + I Current (FvwmIconMan, CirculateHit) Break

But this is not needed for such conditions as Current, Pick, ThisWindow.
Anyway, to be consistent with the rest of the function (that does not use
Current), you would better use Pick here (or ThisWindow):

  + I Pick (FvwmIconMan) Break

>  + "I" Cond (1) Echo "Still here"

Well, this is never executed unless Break is broken.

Try the latest cvs just to be sure.
Ah, yes, sure. Break was fixed on 2003-02-21.

Instead of the plain flat bar I use, one with a pattern of horizontal
lines is being drawn (a built-in one maybe?).

It looks like that restarting the window manager wasn't sufficient to
set correctly all the changes; exiting to the console and restarting X
resolved both the problems, title bar and sticky attribute. 
I think it's a bit strange, shouldn't be the same for Style settings ?
Anyway I think I'll follow you're suggestion.

I have a CVS checkout (because I want to try some recent stuff,
in particular the autohide ideas).

Naturally this lacks a configure file.

What command do I issue to get to the point where I can say "./configure ..."?

Cheers,

Thanks. Any reason this script can't be streamlined to this?

        set -x
        aclocal || exit 1
        autoheader || exit 2
        automake --add-missing || exit 3
        autoreconf || exit 4
        ./configure ${1+"$@"} || exit 5

The reason for final incantation is here:

	http://www.cskk.ezoshosting.com/cs/answers/shell-argument-magic.txt

I do the "set -x" thing for several of my own wrappers whose purpose is
to correctly perform some special incantation. It's succinct and actually
recites all the command arguments, versus the plain "echo command_name"
in the script as it is.

Cheers,

I just moved to fvwm CVS of 2003-04-16 from fvwm-2.5.6.
I have Alt-Right-Button bound to Move in a window context:

	Mouse    3 W M           Move

This used to apply on button-down, so I could go Alt-M3-drag and slide my
windows around. Not is applies on button-up, which is much less pleasant.

Can I exert control over which transition counts?
The manual doesn't suggest so to me, but perhaps I've missed something.

Cheers,

I encountered the same thing--the explination is basically that having
Move work this way from the mouse binding is actually a bug, and the
proper way to do it is from a function using "I" (immediate.)  Search
the message subjects for "'Move' only happens on mouse release" for the
thread where I asked about it.

I wrote a short awk script to automatically fix an fvwm2rc for the
lazy.  It's attached to the thread I mentioned, but if you can't find
that I've also put it at http://themuffin.net/fvwm-mousecmd-convert.awk

Hmm.

As near as I can tell just moving the action into a function changed nothing:

	Mouse                   3 W M           Function MoveWindow

	DestroyFunc MoveWindow
	AddToFunc MoveWindow    I       Current Move

Am I completely clueless? The behaviour still obtains on mouse-release only.

I haven't forgotten about this.

I just have no clue.

Your traces show button 4 getting passed to xev, but not button 5.

I can't reproduce it.

This issue is in the todo list:

D. To be discussed
------------------

  D.2 Leave or remove the current change to triggering bindings on button press
      or release?  Seems to irritate a lot of users, but fixes a root window
      binding bug.
      [dv: added on 29-Mar-2003]

As far as I know there is only this compatibility issue between 2.4.x and
the future 2.6.  I don't think this fix is worth having to run a conversion
script.

There are some issues with using a beta.  This change may or may not remain.
Right now, I'm living with the problem rather than change my config.

Upgrade to a current release and alt-tab will just work,
otherwise see question 3.3 in the FAQ.

Aha.

Could a comprimise be reached - support both transitions? I wouldn't
care which way the default went if I could catch either action. I can
even imagine uses for both.

This is wrong.  It may even move a different window than you click
on.  Try

  AddToFunc MoveWindow    I Move

Unfortunately, triggering actions and selecting windows with the
mouse is very tricky.  I can't think of a feasible way to have
Move, Resize etc. work on button press and not break them on the
root window.

Hm, my mails from seem to be stuck again.  I already replied that
this issue is already fixed in 2.5.x.  I don't think I'll fix it
in 2.4.x since the diffs in that area are huge, near 100% of the
button handling code.

Can you try a recent snapshot? Dorothy Robinson report a problem with
png on a solaris/sparc system (2002-11-28). The problem was fixed just
at 2.5.6 release time and I am not sure that the fix is in 2.5.6.

I do not think that FvwmDebug can help for this png problem.

No, please install fvwm-2.4.15-1.i386.rpm instead, so you don't run the
long ago fixed bugs.

It should work.

Do you have NumLock pressed? See FAQ #0.1.

Do you redefine the "Key Tab A M ..." binding in your .fvwm2rc?

Hello there...I'm trying my best to get antialiased fonts happening with 
2.5.6 (or any 2.5 version, really)

I'm wondering if there's anyone who could help out by showing me a 
.fvwm2rc file (or excerpt) so that I can make sure I'm doing it right.

I have Xft compiled and installed correctly, afaik.

thanks much!
John Allspaw

Thanks for the reply Olivier.  I read through the emails that you 
exchanged with Dorothy.  Unfortunately her problem seems unrelated to 
mine.  For one, I also had tried using a snapshot from 2002-12-20 (that 
fixed a high-color problem I was having with Solaris), which is after 
the snapshot you provided on 2002-12-02 to fix Dorothy's problem.  I'm 
having problems even loading PNGs.

thanks,
Ben

e.g.=20

WindowFont      "Xft:Arial:style=3DRegular:size=3D12:encoding=3Diso8859-15"

works for me. See the man page for details.

WindowFont command is obsoleted. See the man page for details.

Here is an interesting reading about Xft fonts:

Pleas try to strip down your config as much as possible and post
it here so we can see what's going on.

Hm, your function works fine for me.  The Break command was broken
before 2.5.6 though, but you said you had 2.5.6.

Hello all,

I've just upgraded to fvwm 2.4.15 and I'm trying to get the
same look-and-feel that I had with fvwm1.24r. 

The convert scripts and a little tweaking have almost got
me there. But I haven't been able to fix the following,
inspite of going through the FAQ/man page/sample .fvwm2rc
files:

- how do I get rid of the small horizontal lines at the left 
  and right ends of icons?

- there's an extra/noticeable white border around windows, 
  title bars, and buttons that wasn't there before. I'm 
  guessing this could be because the relief is greater than 
  it was before. Any way to change this?

Thanks for any tips,
Mandar.

ps: I'm running RH7.3, in case that's relevant.

It's an interaction between the code in HandleButtonPress
(events.c), the code in functions.c and the execution context code
(execcontext.c).  You may also want to take a loot at functable.c.

It might be easier to explain your idea and let me see how it can
be implemented :-)  Command execution is perhaps the most
complicated thing inside fvwm.  Of course it is possible to learn
how it works, but that process takes a lot of time.

OK.

It's not exactly identical to what I had with 1.24r, but *very*
close. I can live with this :).

Thanks a lot,

Read the module interface documentation at the web site.

Consider perl instead of c using the new perllib in 2.5.x.

I just built png support into my Solaris version.  It worked fine.

I installed libpng1.2.5.

I'm not root so it was not installed in a standard library.
During make I had:

export LD_OPTIONS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"

the -R is important so that Fvwm can find the library.

If you are still having problems, try to supply more information.

Start fvwm, click on the background, choose one of the setup options.

I'm trying to use the Icon Manager instead of icons. After starting the Icon Manager, I get both icons and the Icon Manager. So I tried to get rid of the icons using:

Style * NoIcon

But now when I iconify a window it disappears from the Icon Manager too. Can I get rid of the icons, but keep the iconified windows in the Icon Manager too?

Thanks,

Rob

Icon Manager?

I'm guessing you tried FvwmIconBox but what you really want is FvwmIconMan.

Hi Dan,

I tried re-building everything with even more explicit library paths, 
but I'm still not able to display a PNG with FVWM.  And like I said 
before everything shows that I've successfully built in PNG support. 
Here's what I used before running configure.

setenv LDFLAGS "-L /usr/local/lib -R /usr/local/lib
-L /usr/openwin/lib -R /usr/openwin/lib
-L /lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/xpm-3.4k-solaris
-R /lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/xpm-3.4k-solaris
-L /lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/lib
-R /lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/lib"


./configure --prefix=/lsi/home/bsferraz/bin/fvwm-2.5 
--with-xpm-library=/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/xpm-3.4k-solaris/lib 
--with-xpm-includes=/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/xpm-3.4k-solaris/include 
--with-png-library=/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/lib 
--with-png-includes=/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/include


Would it be OK if I attached a copy of my config.log file for you to 
quickly scan over?  Maybe you could find something that suggests why PNG 
support wasn't actually built-in although it reports it as such.  I 
appreciate your help.

thanks,
Ben

Before you send me the log...

I don't think using LDFLAGS is the right way to go.
Use LD_OPTIONS.  Thats the way I do it.

Be sure to remove config.cache before you configure.
Also make sure everything gets rebuilt.

I've been guessing that the -R isn't getting passed to the linker.
You can check that by unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and using ldd:

fork> ldd /usr/local/src/fvwm/2.5.7/fvwm
        libXpm.so.4.10 =>        /usr/local/lib/libXpm.so.4.10
        libSM.so.6 =>    /usr/lib/libSM.so.6
        libICE.so.6 =>   /usr/lib/libICE.so.6
        libXext.so.0 =>  /usr/lib/libXext.so.0
        libX11.so.4 =>   /usr/lib/libX11.so.4
        libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
        libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
        libm.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libm.so.1
        libpng.so.3 =>   /usr/local/lib/libpng.so.3
        libz.so =>       /usr/lib/libz.so
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
        libdl.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
        libdga.so.1 =>   /usr/openwin/lib/libdga.so.1
        libmp.so.2 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.2
        /usr/platform/SUNW,Ultra-5_10/lib/libc_psr.so.1

ldd should be able to find all the libraries.

I'm rebuilding now with LD_OPTIONS.  I'll let you know how that works out.

here's my ldd output:

ldd fvwm-2.5.6/bin/fvwm
         libXpm.so.4.11 =>        (file not found)
         libSM.so.6 =>    /usr/openwin/lib/libSM.so.6
         libICE.so.6 =>   /usr/openwin/lib/libICE.so.6
         libXext.so.0 =>  /usr/openwin/lib/libXext.so.0
         libX11.so.4 =>   /usr/openwin/lib/libX11.so.4
         libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
         libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
         libm.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libm.so.1
         libpng.so.3 => 
/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/lib/libpng.so.3
         libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
         libdl.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
         libmp.so.2 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.2
         libucb.so.1 =>   /usr/ucblib/libucb.so.1
         libresolv.so.2 =>        /usr/lib/libresolv.so.2
         libelf.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libelf.so.1


So it is using the same path for PNG that I provided during configure.

Notice that it can't find the xpm library.
Are you normally exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

If so, what does the output look like with its normal setting?

It looks like 'rox' is just a script that calls another script  that 
that handles development related switches (starting rox from the
debugger etc.) and then calls the right binary.
Using just the binary seems to work perfectly.
I added the following line to the menu

+	"Rox"		Exec exec \ /usr/local/apps/ROX-Filer/FreeBSD-ix86/ROX-Filer

Dan,

Yes, I even added the library paths to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and tried 
re-building everything with LD_OPTIONS instead of LDFLAGS.  Still I have 
no luck displaying PNG files through FVWM.

Here's the output of ldd for my latest build.  It's now finding libXpm, 
but I'm now getting these SUNW issues which I didn't have before.  I 
don't this is related to the PNG problems though.

         libXpm.so.4.11 =>        /usr/local/lib/libXpm.so.4.11
         libSM.so.6 =>    /usr/openwin/lib/libSM.so.6
         libSM.so.6 (SUNWprivate) =>      (version not found)
         libICE.so.6 =>   /usr/openwin/lib/libICE.so.6
         libICE.so.6 (SUNWprivate) =>     (version not found)
         libXext.so.0 =>  /usr/openwin/lib/libXext.so.0
         libXext.so.0 (SUNW_1.1) =>       (version not found)
         libX11.so.4 =>   /usr/openwin/lib/libX11.so.4
         libX11.so.4 (SUNW_1.1) =>        (version not found)
         libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
         libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
         libm.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libm.so.1
         libpng.so.3 => 
/lsi/vp/spiderman/user/bsferraz/bin/libpng-1.2.5/lib/libpng.so.3
         libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
         libdl.so.1 =>    /etc/lib/libdl.so.1
         libmp.so.2 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.2
         libucb.so.1 =>   /usr/ucblib/libucb.so.1
         libresolv.so.2 =>        /usr/lib/libresolv.so.2
         libelf.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libelf.so.1


I noticed your ldd output should libz.so.  Is this the zlib that libpng 
requires.  Of course when I built the libpng libraries, I had to link 
zlib, but do I now have to link zlib when building FVWM?

thanks,
Ben

Unless you have a static libz, it should show libz.

I don't know why you have /usr/openwin/lib libraries not found,
maybe you should add -R/usr/openwin/lib to LD_OPTIONS.

I don't know if we are getting anywhere.  I think it would abort or
print an error if this is where the problem was.
I'll have to look around.  Maybe someone else has an idea.

How are you trying to display a PNG?

I simply did:

Style test Icon <full-path-to-png>

then I started an xterm:

xterm -name test

and iconified the window.

Does the png display with other programs.

"display" from ImageMagic works with .png.

Hello, all.

As a sign of the good will, the fvwm developers decided to dedicate the
next stable and unstable releases to all victims of the last war.
Just like with the previous dedication of fvwm-2.4.1 to the victims of
the New York tragedy, you are invited to add your name.

Please note however, this is not a political action, but a human sympathy
action (as a proof, the developers that decided to subscribe the
dedication have different visions of the situation), so please refrain
from spamming this list with your political preferences.

If you wish to subscribe the dedication, please mail me privatelly
with a short message "I want to subscribe, The Name". The text is:

  This release is dedicated to all victims of the war in Iraq that
  began in March, 2003.  The following people, many of them users
  or developers of fvwm, would like to express their sympathies to
  those affected:

  ...
  [The Name]
  ...

I should add that one of the developers was highly distressed by a
decission to solve the conflict by killing innocent people, and his
morale to continue with our project partially depends on the number
of people willing to sign up the dedication.

Please be active (by sending a short message to me privatelly), but
please also refrain from any controversial discussions on the list,
we don't need to be divided.  Thank you and peace to all.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Icon Manager?

I'm guessing you tried FvwmIconBox but what you really want is FvwmIconMan.

Do wrap lines around 69 or so characters to give me no incentive to
ignore your mail otherwise.

You mean icons (scrattered) on the screen?

Do you mean you do not want to have icons on the screen but want
application icons displayed besides the titles of icons?

If so, RTFM (M: FvwmIconMan)...

  *FvwmIconMan: [id] DrawIcons value
        If your version of fvwm is capable of  using  mini  icons,
        then this option  determines if FvwmIconMan displays the mini
        icons.  Otherwise, it generates an error  message.   "true"
        means  that mini  icons  are  shown for iconified windows,
        "false" that mini icons are never shown, and "always" that
        mini  icons  are  shown for all windows.

Hello,

I have just installed fvwm 2.5.6 on my RedHat 8 system, but I have this 
strange problem. The fonts are virtually unreadable. I can read the font on 
the buttonbar, but the menu which pops up when I press the "start" button is 
almost unreadable. The same goes for the fonts on the titlebar of windows 
and the fonts in the fvwm configuration form. How do I correct this problem?

Thanks
/Peter

Hi,

I want to add a volume control and a clock to an FvwmButtons panel. 
Currently, I'm using wmmixer and wmclock (those are dockable applets for 
Window Maker). However, they are not centered in the corresponding buttons. 
I already tried specifying "-geometry" but that isn't accepted by these 
applets. Therefore my question: Is it possible to center a swallowed app in 
an FvwmButtons button?

In addition, I have another question: I'm not sure whether these Window 
Maker applets are all that resource friendly (they each depend on several 
shared libraries that otherwise might not be needed). What swallowable apps 
do you recommend to use as a volume control and clock?

BTW, xclock doesn't cut it since it doesn't seem to be possible to specify 
the date below the time (linebreaks in the format string (%n) don't seem to 
be interpreted by xclock).

Felix

Hi,

when I start an application on a certain desktop, say 1, and switch to 
another desktop, say 2, I find it annoying that the application pops up on 
desktop 2. Is there a setting to force all applications and their child 
windows to appear on the desktop where they were started?

Hello,

Since I'm new to this list, forgive if my searching thru the archive hasn't
resulted in the correct hit.

But I was wondering, if there is an option to fvwm to get the title bar from
the top to the
right of the screen.

Reason for this is, while monitors are getting bigger, most of the growed is
in the horizontal area,
so in practice, you gain more, by placing the title bar vertical instead of
horizontal.


Is this possible with fvwm?
If so, how should I do this,
if not, is it possible a feature add-on?


Thanks,

IzNoGood
Netherlands.

=46rom the man page (around line 4387):

       Window title
              The Title and NoTitle options determine if the window has
              a title=E2=80=90bar or not.  By default all windows have a ti=
tle=E2=80=90
              bar.

              Windows    with   the   TitleAtBottom,   TitleAtLeft   or
              TitleAtRight style have a title=E2=80=90bar below, to the lef=
t or
              to  the  right  of  the window instead of above as usual.
              The TitleAtTop  style  restores  the  default  placement.

Although I only half buy your theory that most of the growth is
horizontal--most video modes have an aspect ratio of 4:3 (4y =3D 3x):
	640x480 -> 640 * (3/4) =3D 480
	800x600 -> 800 * (3/4) =3D 600
	etc.

There are, of course, exceptions--1280x1024 is 5:4 (actually having a
larger vertical size), and WUXGA (those fancy wide-screen LCDs) is
1920x1200 (8:5)--it'd be good to use title bars on the side here, since
there really is a lot more space horizontally...

I don't think I would personally, though--the rotated text looks weird
to me. :)

Well, that's a little tricky...  FVWM doesn't know which desktop an
application was started on, but you can say that you want to start a
certain application on a certain desktop all of the time with the Style
command, or you can have an application say it wants to start on a
certain desktop with an X resource.

Check out 'THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP' section in the manpage.

Yes, it is possible in 2.5.x version:

  Style * TitleAtRight

You may also want (probably not) to use:

  Style * RightTitleRotatedCCW    # CCW = counter-clock-wise, default: CW
  Style * !UseTitleDecorRotation  # don't rotate titlebar pixmaps/gradients

If an application sets a window group hint on all its windos, you may
force them to appear on the same desk using:

  Style * KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk

If your app does not set this hint, I guess, you may submit a feature
request to that application.

There is no enough info to help you. And this is probably not an FVWM
problem.

By "unreadable" do you mean tiny or bad quality?

What is the font you use for menus (search for "MenuStyle * Font" line)?
What is the locale you use (run 'locale' from a shell)?

Do you have good fonts installed (at least XFree86-100dpi-fonts)?
Does your font server (xfs) function properly? How other apps show texts?

If you speak about the Setup95 configuration, for menus it uses font
"-*-times-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*", you may test it by running:

  xterm -g 40x10 -fn '-*-times-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Of course it is not a monospace font, so xterm does not look ok with it.
But at least it should be pretty readable.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Yeah, that way wm* things are hard to work with.

I don't know about -Buttons (any option that would specify a button
to be centered), but here wmmixer seems to be centered.

I like wmmixer very much; i tried some others but not any one of
them were any more impressive -- in terms of small binary size
& dependencies, and ease of placement -- than wmmixer itself.

I like analog clocks & watches w/ decent contrast.  Rclock is what
i have (not in -Buttons, on its own); i use its title at the bottom
for date.  Perhaps some digital display clock would be able to
easily display both date & time in the compressed space.

You can see the rclock in the screenshot on lower left...

  (Those are old pictures; currently i do have wmmixer centered
  inside -Buttons.)

Hm, many apps don't support that hint. But I forged a function that might be 
usable as a replacement for Exec:
    
    DestroyFunc DExec
    AddToFunc DExec
    + I Style $0 StartsOnDesk $[desk.n], SkipMapping
    + I Exec $0

But this doesn't seem to work since the command name $0 doesn't neccessarily 
coincide with the proper style idenitifier.

Any ideas how to fix this?

BTW, even KDE has that feature builtin.

I have no idea if the applications you are trying to use it with support
-xrm, but in theory ... (ie completely untested):

DestroyFunc DExec
AddToFunc DExec
+ I Exec $0 -xrm "*Desk:$[desk.n]" $1

if you call it using:

DExec xterm "-e mutt"

will do the correct thing.

OK, that's what I wanted to hear. It's a nice applet indeed.

I use "watch date" in an rxvt now:

    *FvwmButtons: (1x1+11 Swallow(UseOld,NoHints) "Clock Applet" `Exec exec
     rxvt -bg grey35 -fg black -cr grey35 +sb -geometry 8x4 -T "Clock
     Applet" -e watch --no-title -n 1 'date +"%T%n%e. %b.  %Y"'`)

This way, of course, I can only use a digital display. But I prefer that 
anyways.

Stupid me - padding is the way to go. At least when the applets are smaller 
than the buttons then this works fine.

If your button is larger than a swallowed application and that swallowed
application does not want to be resized (does not implement resizing),
you may still force it to be centered by adjusting a padding:

  *FvwmButtons-Compact: (4x4, Swallow wmxmms 'Exec wmxmms', Padding 10)

Try the corresponding FvwmScript based applets that are included in
fvwm-themes, you may even edit them to suit your needs if you like.
They are called FvwmApplet-{Day,DigitalClock,DayClock,Mixer}.

You may swallow 2 xclocks to solve this:

  xclock -name xclock1 -digital -update 60 -strftime '%d/%b/%Y'
  xclock -name xclock2 -digital -update 1 -strftime '%T'

I like/use xtmix available at
http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~mdenn/xtmix/xtmix_en.html
It's small and lean, and has a simple dockable volume control, right
click on it for the full mixer.

You could also try xdaliclock for a nice dockable clock.

BTW fvwm ships with nice FvwmScript's for both mixer AND clocks and a
whole lot more besides.

Do "fvwm-config --info | grep Data" for the location of the default
config files on your system.

To run these applets open an FvwmConsole and type...

Module FvwmScript <script-name>

In Red Hat 8.0 they changed the LANG from en_US to en_US.UTF-8". To make
it work right, edit...

/etc/sysconfig/i18n and change LANG="en_US.UTF-8" to LANG="en_US". 

Then log out from the shell and back in. man and other apps will display
correct characters.

Some other rh8 specific quirks are answered/explained here....

Pass 2 arguments to a function, the mask and the command line.

Which feature exactly do you speak about?
Explain in detail what you want to get that KDE has builtin.
Which application and which popup windows?

I suspect there is a solution for your app without using StartsOnDesk.

Yes, it is possible in 2.5.x version:

  Style * TitleAtRight

You may also want (probably not) to use:

  Style * RightTitleRotatedCCW    # CCW = counter-clock-wise, default: CW
  Style * !UseTitleDecorRotation  # don't rotate titlebar pixmaps/gradients

Thanks, but this is not an option. Some applications (eg. Mozilla) ignore 
that option and some (eg. Knode) complain about it and don't start at all.

Uh, then I need to find the mask (what is that exacly, do you mean the 
class?) for each application that I have in the menus. Any idea how to 
automate this by a script when I use eg. FVWM menus generated by external 
tools.

It's quite simple: Under KDE when I start an application on a certain 
desktop, say 2, and switch to another desktop, say 1, then, after being 
loaded, the application will pop up on desktop 2 without interrupting me 
working on desktop 1. Note that I'm not sure whether that holds true for 
absolutely all application and, unfortunately, I can't check it since KDE 
doesn't start anymore on my system (this might be due to some bugs in 
XFree86 as part of SuSE 8.2).

I mean any name with a possible wildcards that Style accepts: window
name, class or resource. As reported by FvwmIdent for example.

You can't automate a proper discovering of this name/pattern given the
executable name unless there is a central database of all application
window names. I am not aware of such.

You still didn't say which application shows a problem for you.

I just happened to run konqueror to test how a site looks in it and it
opened a dialog window (transient) on the same desk where the konqueror
itself runs when I was on another desk.

Mikhael.

That's not what I described (although this is another feature I want). Just 
try this:
    1. Goto desktop 2
    2. Start Konqueror
    3. Switch to desktop 1
Then Konqueror will pop up on desktop 1. In KDE Konqueror will pop up on 
desktop 2.

I hope that I didnt miss this somewhere.  I have not been able to figure 
out how to use the mouse wheel to scroll to a new desktop like in 
fluxbox.  I have been thumbing thrue the man pages but I perhaps I over 
looked it. 

Thank you!

Hi,

I want to do a lot of "realtime" (i.e. M4 is not an option) arithmetics in 
.fvwm2rc. Currently I'm using expressions like
    PipeRead `let "x=$[FVWM_A]*$[FVWM_B]"; printf "SetEnv
        FVWM_C $$x"`
This has two advantages:
1. It is not very readable
2. It depends on the shell I'm using

Are there any better ways for doing arithmetics in FVWM? Will arithmetics 
ever be built in?

Felix

Use FvwmPerl in 2.5.x for arithmetics and string operations:

  FvwmPerl

  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval  $c = "AnimatedMove"; $n = 50;
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval  cmd("Current $c " . ($n / 2) . " 10p")
  SendToModule FvwmPerl eval  $n /= 5; cmd("AnimatedMove $n 50")

This way you don't need environment variables or separate processes.

But read the man page first. And see the X output for your possible
perl errors.

FvwmPerl may also be used as a more powerful replacement for FvwmCpp and
FvwmM4 using its -p (--preprocess) flag.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I found a simple solution that makes arithmetics more readable, at least:

  DestroyFunc Let
  AddToFunc Let
  + I PipeRead `bash -c 'let "FVWM_LET_TMP=$1"; printf "SetEnv $0
  $$$$FVWM_LET_TMP"'`

That way I can easily write complicated arithmetic expressions, eg.

  Let FVWM_TMP "($[desk.n] >= $[FVWM_HDESKS]) ? -$[FVWM_HDESKS] : 0"

It also is independent of the shell "sh" since "bash" is specified 
explicitly.

What do you think of it? If you think it could be added to the FAQ, I'm 
willing to write the entry.

Hm, don't you consider Perl a separate process? In addition, don't I need 
environment variables to interface with perl? 

Also, is there some reason to avoid environment variables? If I avoid name 
clashes by prefixing them all with eg. FVWM_ then I believe that shouldn't 
cause any trouble.

To be honest, I don't like that preprocessing stuff. Some standard FVWM 
expressions do always collide with the preprocessor.

If you don't know, the mouse wheel is actually reported to the X server
as buttons 4 and 5 (at least if your X server is correctly configured.)=20
Therefore, all you need is a mouse binding for each button--e.g.:

Mouse	4	R	A	GotoDesk -1
Mouse	5	R	A	GotoDesk +1

The above will go to the previous desktop if you scroll the mouse wheel
up, and to the next desktop if you scroll the mouse wheel down.  If
that's not exactly what you're looking for, hopefully it's enough
information to get you on the right track.

Hello,

Thanks for the replies I got :-)

I have fixed the problem. I don't know exectly what caused this problem, but 
after experimenting with some setups I suddently got readable fonts. Sorry 
for not being more specific in my initial post about this subject, but I'm 
very new to Fvwm.

Regards
/Peter

P.s. Apparently I forgot to write a subject in my initial post, sorry ;-)

I mean that when you start one FvwmPerl process together with fvwm,
there are 0 forks per line. And when you invoke PipeRead (i.e. /bin/sh)
that then starts bash, printf and similar, there are 3 forks per line.

If it is easier for you to build a program using environment variables
(or by creating temporarily files), just do it. But there is another way.

This is not the case with "FvwmPerl -p", there are no such collisions.
Try it just for fun. :) Here are several random ideas for preprocessing:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec exec xterm -n %{ $USER eq "root" ? "superuser" : $USER }% -ls

%{
	$MAIN_FONT = "lucidasans-10";
	@apps = ([ 'netscape', 'Netscape' ], [ 'xterm', 'XTerm' ]);
	$number_of_mouse_buttons = `xmodmap -pp | cut -d' ' -f3` + 0;
	""  
}%

%ModuleConfig FvwmPager destroy
	SolidSeparators
	Font %{$MY_MAIN_FONT}%
	Colorset 0
	DeskTopScale 28
	MiniIcons
%End ModuleConfig FvwmPager

AddToMenu Apps Applications Title
%{
	$menu = "";
	foreach (@apps) {
		($prog, $name) = @$_;
		$menu .= "+ '%$prog%$name' Exec exec $prog\n"
	}
	$menu;
}%

AddToFunc StartXTermWithUniqueTitle
+ I Exec xterm -name xterm-%{++$i}% -ls

%{ $number_of_mouse_buttons < 4 ? "Nop" : "" }% Mouse 4 R A GotoDesk +1

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it is at least much more readable then your solution with bash
and dozen of environment variables.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,
           I am using Embedded Linux Image on x86 plotfom ,I disabled mouse 
with option -allowMouseOpenFail in /usr/X11R6/bin/startx file.Iam using fvwm2
as window manager.Iam getting focus problem ,when i execute the QT 
application.I moved the cursor to -40 -40 location using CursorMove -40 -40 
command in the .fvwm2rc and system.fvwm2rc files.

The problem is:
My appilcation opens root window,this root window logins and opens a child
window.When i close this child window, the root windows doesn't getting the 
focus, so that nothing works.But it works fine if i move the cursor to 0 0 
position.Can anybody help me please.

OK, here's a realization in Perl:
    DestroyFunc Let
    AddToFunc Let
    + I SendToModule FvwmPerl eval my $tmp = $1; command("SetEnv $0 $tmp");

Anyways, what's the disadvantage of creating other processes?

Ok, I see that Perl code is always included between %{ and }%. This indeed 
makes this module much more appropriate for preprocessing than FvwmM4 and 
FvwmCPP. There, in addition to name clashes, one has to adapt quoting and 
this is extremely annoying.

What you showed is preprocessing. As said in my original post, what I'm 
after is realtime processing where I need several global variables anyways. 
Concerning readability: I'm not a Perler and for me the code isn't very 
readable at all. Many FVWM users probably prefer a solution where they can 
do simple arithmetics without knowing Perl.

Your original message was about the native support of arithmetics
(does this include scripting and string manipulation or just 2+2?).

Can you define what would be the desired (and still not conflicting)
syntax for you? I think that if you insist on using only what you know
(i.e. bash), there is no point to suggest you something else. :)
Then just stick to PipeRead and fvwm+shell escaping, it works ok.

By the way, most of the sh-like shells support $(( 1 > 2 ? 3 : 2 + 2 )).

Regards,
Mikhael.

Just 2+2, etc.. It's probably not neccessary to include native arithmetics 
since it can easily be done using 3rd party tools. But if there is a lot of 
demand I guess it might be easy to add a simple Let command (I'm sure there 
are several small C libraries around that allow the avaluation of simple C 
like arithmetic expressions). OTOH such a command can also be easily forged 
by using Perl or other tools, maybe an example should be added to the FAQ.

Hi,

I want *maximized* windows to be without a title bar and only one flat frame 
around them, i.e. they should have the style

   Style * BorderWidth 16, HandleWidth 16
   Style * NoTitle
   Borderstyle -- Flat

Normal windows, however, should have a normal frame with a title bar, handle 
bars, etc.. 

How do I realize such a configuration?

BTW, because the FVWM man page is so long it is very cumbersome to find the 
information I want (e.g. when I want to know how "Exec" works I have to 
repeat searching many times). As a manual browser I tried Man and WoMan in 
EMACS but Man is not very comfortable and WoMan doesn't render some parts 
correcty. What manual browsers do you recommend (preferably in EMACS)?

Hm, I cannot get preprocessing to work. Here are the relevant lines from my 
.xinitrc:

    WINDOWMANAGER='/home/felix/local/bin/fvwm -cmd "Module FvwmPerl -p 
/home/felix/.fvwm2rc"'
    exec $WINDOWMANAGER 2> ~/local/var/log/windowmanager.log

But when starting FVWM I always get

    [FVWM][__execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command '%{'
    [FVWM][__execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command '}%'

BTW, could you add a section in the FvwmPerl man page that describes the 
configuratin neccessary for preprocessing and possibly more (sorry if it's 
already there, but I couldn't find it). This would simplify things a lot 
for beginners like me.

Another question: When I restart FVWM with Restart is .fvwm2rc then 
repreprocessed?

I am stuck.  I am not able to get pixmap buttons on my titlebars.

I thought I just had to do this

ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap mac-window-shade.xpm  --Top Left

However the button doesnt show up. I have tried this also with 
AddButtonStyle.

Is there a tutorial out there that explains how to get pretty title bars 
and pixmaps? The man pages are confusing me a bit.  I guess I dont know 
how I am supposed to define all the options.

Catherine

Buttons only display if you make them do something.

For each button you want to display add a line like this:

Mouse 0   1 A     "Iconify"
Mouse 0   3 A     Windowshade
Mouse 0   5 A     Module FvwmIdent

This command looses the meaning of double quotes, so it becomes
-cmd '"Module'.

Try:

  eval $WINDOWMANAGER

No, "exec eval" does not work, contact your shell documentation for more.

I would suggest to name your configuration file differently, so you know
what type of file you have, say $HOME/.fvwm/config.ppp.

OK.

With "Restart", yes.

It does not seem to be possible to pass an environment variable as a command 
line to Bash's Exec command. One probably has to specify the arguments and 
the command name separately, eg. 
    exec $WM $WM_ARG1 $WM_ARG
works. However, I found this too cumbersome. So I wrote a little startup 
script "~./fvwm/startfvwm" and let this be called from .xinitrc.

Ok, here is a solution that makes your suggested function Let (that sets
environment variable) redundant. I call the function "." for compactness.
You may do 2+2 inside the command without temporary environment variables.

  AddToFunc .
  I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- $*

  . Exec exec xmessage %{2 + 2}%

  . GotoDesk 0 %{ $[desk.n] + 1 }%

  Next (MyWindow) . Move \
    %{($WIDTH - $[w.width]) / 2}%p %{($HEIGHT - $[w.height]) / 2}%p

The first example opens a "4" window, the second goes to the next desk.
The last example centers the given window, it should work in theory, but
it does not currently in cvs (should investigate why, probably a bug with
window contexts somewhere), here is a workaround for this using WindowId:

  Next (MyWindow) . WindowId $[w.id] Move \
    %{($WIDTH - $[w.width]) / 2}%p %{($HEIGHT - $[w.height]) / 2}%p

More examples that use some perl, not just arithmetics:

  . Exec exec xterm -name xterm-%{++$i}%
  . Exec exec %{ -x "/usr/bin/X11/aterm" ? "aterm" : "xterm" }% -sb

If this helps, I may put this in FAQ.

The function above only works in the current cvs, there was one problem.
If you want to use this with 2.5.2+ versions instead of cvs, then the "."
function above should be defined as the following instead:

Hello,

I want to install the latest vision of fvwm 2.5.6 on my debian system.
My debian is unstable. My problem is that when I config fvwm, it can't
enable xft, in the log, first it can't find fontconfig-config, and
can't find a xft version >= 2.0, but I'm sure that in my system, I've
installed libxft2.0 and fontconfig and the libs.. I don't what's wrong,
how can I solve it..

anybody can help me? thank you!

xft switched to pkgconfig instead of having a separate -config script.=20
I meant to mention this to the list, but I like to provide solutions
when I do and I didn't feel like wrangling with autoconf.  I promptly
forgot about it.

I did, however, make a workaround at the time: I'm attaching a
fontconfig-config script which is basically just a wrapper around
pkgconfig.  The script's not perfect, but it works well enough to
compile fvwm.

In 2.4.x and earlier, try the ClickToFocus style for the windows
involved.  In 2.5.x you can specify every single bit of focus
behaviour manually.  Try

  Style <window name> FPGrabFocus, FPReleaseFocus

*after* setting one of the basic focus policies.

Because I am the only developer with a dual head setup which I
fire up only once in a while.  I did not forget it, but it will

Just to put my oar in:  I'd like to centralise parsing of
numberic arguments everywhere in fvwm in the future.  This will
make it easy to add a <number>[{+-}<number>]... syntax without a
shell.

Do you use the EWMHIgnoreStateHints style?  If yes, switch it off,
if no send a bug report to the KDE/Konqueror folks.  Probably they
are using some KDE internal mechanism to do this instead of using
EWMH hints.

That's very nice. There are some problems though:
o Your command conflicts with preprocessing. However, this can probably be
   solved by using different quote characters for preprocessing or by
   turning off preprocessing. After all, with "." I can move most stuff that
   needs to be preprocessed into init functions.
o The following configuration fails silently (i.e. FvwmPager doesn't start
   and there is no error message):

   AddToFunc .
   + I SendToModule FvwmPerl eval preprocess({ 'command' => 1 } , q<$*>)
   
   AddToFunc StartFunction
   + I Module FvwmPerl
   + I . Module FvwmPager 0 %{ 5 }%

If the above problems can be eliminated I think it is a very good idea to 
put this in the FAQ. Please add some example like the ones above. Also make 
sure that people know that they have to start the FvwmPerl module:

    AddToFunc StartFunction
    + I Module FvwmPerl

No, but to make sure I put 
    Style * EWMHUseStateHints
in my .fvwm2rc

This is not Konqueror specific. I have yet to find an application that 
behaves the way I want. I just tried Netscape and EMACS as well. Both pop 
up on the desktop I'm currently working on, even if they were started on 
another desktop. Again: in KDE this works out of the box. Why can't it work 
under FVWM?

Because it's probably some undocumented KDE internal stuff.

Hello,

Thank you very much for your help first. I'm sorry for my
stupid, I think there is still some problems with my system.
I've copied your scripts to /usr/bin/fontconfig-config
but when I config the fvwm, the error is,

No package '3D' found
Package 3D was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `3D.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable

I don't know what this mean and what should I do?

xft switched to pkgconfig instead of having a separate -config script. 
I meant to mention this to the list, but I like to provide solutions
when I do and I didn't feel like wrangling with autoconf.  I promptly
forgot about it.
I did, however, make a workaround at the time: I'm attaching a
fontconfig-config script which is basically just a wrapper around
pkgconfig.  The script's not perfect, but it works well enough to
compile fvwm.

Well, this function "." was only intended for non-preprocessed configs,
it adds an optional preprocessing to some given lines only.

If you preprocess the whole file, you don't need this function ".",
all lines are preprocessed statically anyway. But you may want this
function for dynamical preprocessing then, for example (syntax for cvs):

  DestroyFunc .
  AddToFunc   .
  + I SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c --quote * -- $*

  Next (XTerm) . Exec xmessage *{ $[w.x] + $[w.y] }*

The man page suggest (I will make it more clear):

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl

With simply "Module", the SentToModule command happens before it's ready.

Sure that's what I'm using it for. And I consider doing all of the 
preprocessing in with "." because this makes it easier to define variables 
and reuse them later.

What about this? Why doesn't it work?

I thought I explained in the parent message why it should be:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl
  + I . Module FvwmPager 0 %{ 5 }%

Or, maybe it does not work for you because you changed the quote char
using preprocess({ 'command' => 1, quote' => '*' }, q<$*>).

Mikhael.

Come to think of it, my FvwmIconMan does exactly this.  But it's
confined in FvwmButtons and can not grow, only shrink the buttons.
This comes close to what you want:

  *FvwmIconMan*ManagerGeometry 0x2

Unfortunately it does not keep the position of the individual
windows constant when new windows are added.

I don't think that this is possible yet, but I'm not an expert

Thank you, that's exactly what i searched for! I always associate
FvwmIconMan with my first meeting of it ... a big ugly box with icons in
it, so i haven't looked at it, but it can also look like the
GnomeWindowApplet. Great!

In Solaris, i also find that if i switch desks or pages between the time
i launched the app from a menu and the time it creates its window, the
app will appear on the desk/[age i'm looking at rather than the desk/page
i was on when i lauched the app.

So i basically wait for the app to appear before switching to another
view....in order to keep the app where i started it.

You probably confuse it with FvwmIconBox.

Granted, FvwmIconMan is a bad name for what it does. :)

Thanks, now it works.

No, I didn't redefine the quote character. I have disabled preprocessing of 
the whole configuration file. The problem is that variables defined during 
this kind of preprocessing aren't available later for use with the "." 
command. Therefore I moved all intitialization to init functions that are 
called from StartFunction. This works very good and AFAICS I don't need 
preprocessing of the whole config file anymore.

Some comments:
1. "." is very cool. Now that everything seems to work fine, please add it
   to the FAQ. And, as said before, include one or two simple examples that
   show that "." is usable with minimal Perl knowledge (eg. for adding 
   variables).
2. It seems that with "." it is only possible to embed one Perl command in  
   %{ ... }% at a time (i.e. not several Perl commands separated by ';').
   That should be made clear in the FAQ.

You can't define a style for maximized windows only, but you may define
it for a group of windows with the same name/class. See for example this:

  http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0303/msg00613.html

You may maximize your windows to the full screen, see this message:

I suggest "man" from the command line (search using "/") and web pages.

Actually it is possible to tell the FvwmPerl that preprocesses the whole
configuration to stay with fvwm, so all variables are still available.
Then use %{}% for statical preprocessing and *{}* for dynamical.

For example, create .fvwm2rc with only one line:

  ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl --preprocess config.ppp --stay

But I should check up all synchronization issues with this.

What is the problem with 2 or 10 commands? Works fine for me (prints 3):

  . Exec exec xmessage %{ $count = 1; $count++; $count + 1 }%

3D is the hex code for =3D, so it sounds like your mailer didn't decode
the attachment correctly.  I've put it at
http://themuffin.net/fontconfig-config so you can grab it there instead,
and that should hopefully work fine for you.

One more question: Why does the following line procude a syntax error (I'm 
using 2.5.6 and the corresponding definition for ".")?
    . Echo %{ if ( 5 > 4 ) { return 5; } else { return 6; } }%

I also tried 
    SendToModule FvwmPerl eval if ( 5 > 4) { command("Echo 5"); } else {
    command("Echo 6"); }
and this works.

That's exactly not what I want. I have a deep black Thinkpad and when I open 
an application with a white background (e.g. EMACS) I find the stark 
contrast at the edges of the screen very disturbing. If it is not possible 
to achieve what I described above, I'll consider switching window managers 
again. Today, many of them are themeable and allow different styles for 
normal sized and maximized windows.

Hm, can't this somehow be modified to do what I want? I tried it, but I was 
unsuccessful.

> I suggest "man" from the command line (search using "/") and web pages.

Well, I guess I'll stay with Man and WoMan in EMACS. They both allow 
comparably easy navigation among sections and WoMan can create a primitive 
table of contents. However, I'm missing a really good index.

Stupid me - of course it seems to be possible. For example

    DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
    AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMaximizeFullScreen
    + I ThisWindow (Maximized) Style $n Title, BorderWidth 4, HandleWidth 4
    + I CondCase (NoMatch) Style $n NoTitle, BorderWidth 16, HandleWidth 16
    + I CondCase (NoMatch) Raise
    + I CondCase (NoMatch) UpdateStyles
    + I Maximize

works. Now I just need to better understand the above commands and tune this 
to make it look nice. BTW, what is that "$n" variable, I couldn't find it 
in the man page?

Both work for me. :)

Ah, yes, this is because you run old fvwm versions and use the q<$*>
syntax in the "." function definition. Replace it with q~$*~, then you
can use ">" but not "~" in your commands.

I really suggest to use run latest snapshot instead and use the syntax
for the "." function that has no such problems.

BTW, you may always omit "return" in perl, the result of the last
expression is used. This is the equivalent of your command:

  . Echo %{ 5 > 4 ? 5 : 6 }%

The 2.5.6 man page only mentions the new spelling $[w.name] and not $n.

The 2.4.16 man page (not released yet) mentions both.

That is because fvwm does not know at which border you want to
start resizing.  I once made a patch that warped to pointer to the
closest border, but most people hated that.

I would have suggested $n but I think its not a general purpose solution.
If you have one emacs frame maximized and another not maximized, the above
will change both of them.

It may be good enough though.  I usually work with 2 xemacs frames, but
I change the second frames resource name ($r) with:

  (select-frame (make-frame '((name . "uniquename"))))

Anyway, I'm happy you found what you needed.

Hello Support Center ;-)

Is it possible to have two titlebars for one window?
I'd like to to have one at the top and one at the bottom.
And is it possible to give them different buttons and heights, to
try to "emulate" the look of wmaker?

Best regards
	Klaus

It works.. Thank you! But now I have the last question to
ask you.. when I config it with you scripts, first it doesn't
work, I check the log, find that it's the problem of
libXft.so, I used XFree86-4.3, the unoffical edition, so
I think maybe it's the problem. I find libXft.so is linked
to libXft.so.2.0, and I also find in XFree86-4.2, it's
linked to libXft.so.1.2, so I copied the libXft.so.1.2 to
my system and link the libXft.so to it, then it works..

my question is that if this will make the system unstable
or something wrong later?

Thank you!

3D is the hex code for =, so it sounds like your mailer didn't decode
the attachment correctly.  I've put it at
http://themuffin.net/fontconfig-config so you can grab it there instead,
and that should hopefully work fine for you.

Hi,

I have a fvwmbutton like this :

*fvwmbuttons: (icon tiny/kmidi.png \
                Panel(position top,right,delay 0,UseOld,NoClose) \
                "LongPlayer")

it works great, it hide/unhide the longplayer window.
But I want to do this only with the left mouse button.
I look to add another action for the right mouse button : minimize xmms.

I look in the manual, but the option [mouse n] is only available to
"action", not to panel. 

How can I doing such feature ?

Thx

Ploum

You should add a ',' here.

Do use "action":

  *fvwmbuttons: \
    (icon tiny/kmidi.png, \
     Panel(position top,right,delay 0,UseOld,NoClose) "LongPlayer", \
     Action (Mouse 3) "All (xmms) iconify on")

Thanks to Mikhail Goikhman I know now how to produce buttons on the
screen. So I don't need the default buttons any more (virtual desktop
switcher, system load, postbox, clock). How can I get rid of them?

Look for commands like this:

*FvwmButtons: (2x1, Swallow "FvwmPager" "FvwmPager 0 1")
*FvwmButtons: (Swallow "asclock" 'Exec asclock -shape -led green -noblink')

and remove them.

I suppose you speak about fvwm-themes, please always make this clear on
this list. I also suppose you use modules from the default theme.

If you use modules@default component, in the root menu you have:

  Theme Management -> Current -> modules -> Choose Button Bar -> No

Mikhael.

Thx for your reply.  I understand better.  But it doesn't work, I don't
know why.

When I add the line "action", the button become 5 time bigger ! ! ! (it's
not pretty at all)  I try different things without success.
It's perhaps related with the rest of my fvwmbutton :

style "fvwmbuttons" sticky, nohandles, notitle, borderwidth 0, staysontop,
parentalrelativity
*fvwmbuttons: columns 1
*fvwmbuttons: pixmap bar.png
*fvwmbuttons: frame 0
*fvwmbuttons: \
    (icon tiny/kmidi.png, \
     Panel(position top,right,delay 0,UseOld,NoClose) "LongPlayer")
*FvwmButtons: (Swallow(UseOld,NoClose) "psi")

I have solved the problem !!!

fvwm workst only with iso-8859-1  ;-))

So all users which use 'C' as there 'locales' will have no problems... 

Zo get the thing running I had to install the following Debian-Packages: 

xfonts-base-transcoded 
xfonts-100dpi-transcoded 
xfonts-75dpi-transcoded 

Now it starts, but I have not TaskBar and no ButtonPanel... 
Why ??? 

Because I have a choosen a font which is not supported by the 
xfonts-X-transcoded. Now all is working fine.

Thanks

You have called the FvwmEvent with:

>> > Module FvwmEvent SoundEvent
>> > *FvwmEvent: Cmd Exec /usr/bin/rplay
>> > *FvwmEvent: new_page ~/sounds/new_page.au
>> > *FvwmEvent: new_desk ~/sounds/new_page.au

So 'SoundEvent' will be an ALIAS to FvwmEvent... 
Configure your Events like: 

*SoundEvent: Cmd Exec /usr/bin/rplay
*SoundEvent: new_page ~/sounds/new_page.au
*SoundEvent: new_desk ~/sounds/new_page.au

And then it must work for you

I use Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 stable and I have version 2.4.6-2

Is there a Debian-Package ??? 
Or do you have a procompiled tgz which I can Debianize ???

Hello, 

never I have programmed under X and now I have a problem... 

I had tried to compile 2.4.15 but I am missing the required 
X-Header-files. 

Can anyone tell me, which Debian-Packages I must install to 
compile it under Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 with Kernel 2.4.19

Thanks
Michelle

I guess you need xlibs-dev or some other *-dev package.

Not yet. You can't blame fvwm developers for this.

Once someone provides an automatic debian package creation procedure from
a tarball similarly to the automatic rpm package creation procedure, it
will be a part of the distribution and we will then create and publish
our own packages. Until this happens you should either contact your
Debian packager or install from sources.

It is described in the man page. The default for 2.4.x is:

  Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

Hi,

I thought it's about time to give fvwm-themes a try.
(version 0.6.2 built for SunOS 5.8).

We're all forced here in my company to use the dt login/session manager.
I'm using a Dtsession X-resource, i.e. 
"Dtsession*wmStartupCommand:    /usr/local/gnu/bin/fvwm2",
to start fvwm instead of CDE (that's what we're supposed to use).
The docu says to add the startup command to .xsession or .xinitrc
(that's how I do it on my Linux PC), but AFAICS this Dtsession
doesn't read either .xinitrc nor .xsession.

I changed the startup command to "/usr/local/gnu/bin/fvwm-themes-start"
and this worked (the only problem I saw was with FvwmBanner see below)
until I tried to select one of the themes. Than I had
these nice color problems, e.g. menues in black on black.
Thus I've changed the Startup command now to
"/usr/local/gnu/bin/fvwm-themes-start -- -l 61" but now my error log has
a lot more to say:

Hi

Recently I wrote this little patch for FvwmButtons so that it now 
understands the [@screen] geometry option. There may be better solutions
but it seems to work. I hope that helps.

But it already has support for '@screen' built in.  You patched

  *FvwmButtons(+x+y@screen, Tile foo, ...)

?!  What would that be good for?

Seems like your awk is not very friendly. I think that I tested awk
without GNU extensions and it worked. Anyway, either don't load
colors@cde and colors@luthien or replace the 2 occuriences of awk with
gawk in 2 files: themes/{cde,luthien}/colors/main.

I prefer someone else to answer this.

Heh, it is funny, I can't reproduce this. Maybe someone else can answer.

Hi,
   I've spent last couple hours going thur FAQs and archives, but
   still not able to figure out. 

   I've two identical monitors connected to matrox graphics card.
   Via the matrox mgapdesk utility, I've configured it to dual-multi
   display automatic xinerama setup.

   The problem is : the new windows created are on the screen I'm not
   viewing, and everytime it causes me to scan thru all Pages looking for
   the new window? Kinda gets annoying, I've way too many windows open...

   In my fvwmrc file : 

   xinerama on
   XineramaSls on
   XineramaSlsSize 2x1

   Any help will be greatly appreciated. 


   Thanks,
   Mukesh

 Hi all,

   I get a problem with fvwm's menu. My locale output is : zh_CN, and the menu in fvwm works well when I startx , however, after sometime(sometimes long , sometimes   
 one minute), the fvwm's menu is DISAPPEAR( that is when I click my mouse on root window, NO menu popup ). What's wrong with my fvwm? ( my fvwm is checked out from cvs, now version is 2.5.7)
   I notice the console output :
   [FVWM][FlocaleGetFontSet]:(-*-fixed-medium-r-...) Missing font charsets: GB2312.1980-0
   [FVWM][convert-charsets]:WARNING- Invalid byte sequence during conversion from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1
    
    Can anybody help me?

    Thanks a lot!

Hm, I cannot reprocude the problem I had anymore. I was assigning several 
variables in a statement similar to
    . Nop %{  $a = 3; $b = 5; }%
called from inside a function, and somehow the variables didn't get defined. 
However, now it works. Maybe I accidentally entered some syntactically 
incorrect Perl code.

This is not nice. Are there any hopes for "MaximizedStyle" and 
"UnMaximizedStyle" commands? 

Another solution might be to allow the window id $[w.id] as a style name in 
the "Style" command. Would that be hard to implement?

The problem is that EMACS was just an example. For other applications that I 
run in multiple instances (e.g. rxvt) this solution is, of course, not 
applicable.

Shit, this mail shouldn't go to your personally, i am very sorry for
this. Especially as i am very pleased with the mailing list. First there
was a ugly standard debien fvwm and now it's the beautiful wm i ever
dreamed of... Thank you all! :)

I will try it with MiniIcons, but i don't see how that could help me
... but i will see ... :)

Yes  the Transparent colorset cannot always be used if the root depth is
different than the fvwm depth.
Can you send the output of xdpyinfo. If you use 2.5.6 (I will recommend
a recent snapshot any way), can you type "PrintInfo Colors" in FvwmConsole
and sent the stderr output of this command which should look like:

FVWM info on colors

What is your Mouse root binding fvwm config command? What happen
if you type in FvwmConsole: "Menu the_name_of_your_root_menu" ?

Your locale is zh_CN and X want fonts with a GB2312.1980-0 charset.
And the "font name" -*-fixed-medium-r-... does not match a font with
a GB2312.1980-0 charset. Maybe you should install such fonts or 
change your font name in your fvwm config file(s). I've:

[olivier@snoopy unstable]$ xlsfonts -fn "*-GB2312.1980-0"
-isas-fangsong ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0
-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0
-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-240-gb2312.1980-0

>    [FVWM][convert-charsets]:WARNING- Invalid byte sequence during conversion from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1
>

Then, maybe the title of one of your window use GB2312.1980-0 characters
(in UTF8) and cannot convert these characters to ISO-8859-1 chars (the
charset of the font you load ...).

Take a look at the "FONT NAMES AND FONT LOADING" and the 
"FONT AND STRING ENCODING" sections of the fvwm manual page for
more information.

that was the "SUN standard" awk, i.e. /usr/bin/awk.
I've made sure that "GNU Awk 3.1.1" is used instead and now it works fine.

Hi,

this is fvwm 2.5.5 with fvwm-themes 0.6.2 on SunOS 5.8.

I'm having a heard time getting fvwm-themes to run properly.
Here are 2 problems that are reported in session error log file:

1. during startup lots of message like:
[FVWM][ReadDecorFace]: <<ERROR>> couldn't load pixmap 16x16/empty.xpm

fvwm-config --info says "xpm: no" so maybe this is to be expected


2. and (constantly growing) the follwing 2 error messages:

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 66, Error 8, EventType: 19

[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> *** internal error ***
[FVWM][FvwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 66, Error 8, EventType: 0


about 3500 errors in 20 minutes. Unfortunately I have no idea how to trace
it down to the culprit.


Also when I try to select a menu entry from the root menue, sometimes
my whole session stalls (3 times today while I was playing with all
these themes) and I have to kill the session.


I appreciate any help. Thanks

Klaus

I'm not sure what you mean by rectangle next to an iconified window.

Do you mean the icon title?

Try:

Style * NoIconTitle

Some day.

We recently had a patch that applied styles by window id.
One problem is that if you close a window and then open a new one,
the new window might have the same windowid.

The style by windowid would have to be removed when the window closes.

I start all my rxvt's with -name to make them unique on resource name.

in my RootMenu configure file, I write like this:" Mouse 1 R N Menu My_Root_Menu". When I type Menu My_Root_Menu in FvwmConsole, my RootMenu can pop up. BTW, I find a very strange phenomena this afternoon: when I press the key "NumLock", then when I click on root , NO RootMenu pop up, BUT when I press the key "NumLock" again, clicking on root , the RootMenu POP UP!!!  I test it many times, I think it is the key " NumLock " prevents me to pop up RootMenu, but I do not know why it happens , maybe you can give me an explaination.

somehow my icons (with and without IconBox) disappeared after an upgrade
to 2.5.5. There must be something in my .fvwm2rc file that causes this. Since
I see icons when I try fvwm-themes. I don't see any error messages.
Any ideas/hints what might cause this?

Thanks

Klaus

One question mark would be enough unless you are trying to
do more than ask a question.

I don't know if your original question was clear enough.
Doing it "like blackbox" doesn't mean anything to me.
If you invoke resize while inside a window, the wire frame will
appear and resizing happens as the pointer reaches an edge.

If you  start resizing the top  edge  then manuver the  pointer to the
corner, then it will resize two edges, and so on.

Fvwm always waits til the pointer gets to an edge.  If it didn't
it would be pretty hard to control the operation so that only the
edge desired got moved.

Dominik referred to a patch where as soon as the resize operation
started, the pointer was moved to the closest edge.  Is that what
you want?  Lots of people don't like the pointer being moved outside
their control.

I don't think thats what you want.  Maybe you should re-ask your
question supplying more detail.

Hello everyone,

In my fvwm I run a sticky gkrellm to monitor what's going on. I would 
like new windows to not overlap this one application. I guess it's done 
with a Style command in .fvwm2rc but I couldn't find it. Any tips? 
Thanks!

well... that is what i want

sorry i reffer to blackbox still (as i'm using fvwm for sometime now)
there, when you hit alt+mouse right , resize starts right away in the
direction you move your mouse
its like you press the border, but you don't have to get your mouse all the
way there

I think this is Very convinient, I don't see why i have to enlarge a window,
just to make it small

p.s - sorry for the two question mark, a habbit

Hi,

this doesn't seem to be true in FVWM 2.5.6:

    FPGrabFocus  is  the  default for windows with the ClickToFocus style.

Although I specified 
    Style * ClickToFocus
new windows (created e.g.  via Exec) don't receive focus unless I specify
    Style * FPGrabFocus

Felix

I'm not sure what you mean.

I think there are two ways to specify the size and position of
FvwmButtons:

1. *FvwmButtons: Geometry 272x68-0-0@p
2. *FvwmButtons: ButtonGeometry 68x68-0-0@p

The second attempt specifies only the size of one Button while the
first attempt specifies the size of the whole window. But the position
part of the geometry works the same way in both cases.

In parse.c the two attempts both modify UberButton which doesn't seem
to be a true button but its coordinates set the position of the window
in the function CreateUberButtonWindow in FvwmButtons.c. The size of
UberButton is only 1 or 0 and it seems to indicate whether or not the
coordinates are negative. Negative coordinates mean for example
south west gravity.

FvwmButtons does not natively support '@screen' in these configuration
options.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Bye

Yves

That sounds like it's not very high in the priority list. Is this really so 
hard to implement. Many window managers (eg. KDE WM, Sawfish) allow 
different appearance of maximized and normal sized windows.

... and this isn't doable in a reliable fashion, I guess. Isn't it possible 
to tell X not to reuse window identifiers if possible? After all these 
numbers are very long and I doubt that I'll run out of identifiers during a 
typical X session (usually lasts one day).

Well, rxvt was again just an example.

Is this correct for you installation, no xpm

It is not very useful to use fvwm-themes without XPM support.

Can you compile fvwm with XPM support? FAQ or INSTALL.fvwm may help.
Moreover, in the future PNG support will be required too for some themes.

If I am correct, the error means "BadDrawable, PolyRectangle".
It may or may not be related to the fact you didn't compile with XPM.
You should not normally get "internal error", but it happens.

You may try running fvwm-2.4.15 and fvwm-themes-0.6.2, but probably you
will get problems without XPM support too.

Mikhael.

There are various plans described to  achieve this in the CVS sources.
Look at todo-3.0 and WindowStyle_proposal.txt.
Since I'm not planning to do the work right now, I'm not going to make
any commitments.  Thats why I said "some day".

The way anything gets high in the priority list is that someone
with coding skills decides they want it.

He means FvwmIconMan, and the option name is DrawIcons, not MiniIcons.

I don't see a rectangle:

but I guess that circled area could end up looking like
a rectangle if I changed the font or colors.

Sorry, I'm a bit confused.

Anyway, it does look like there is a small problem when
DrawIcons is used.  (In the circle).

The problem goes away when I change the font.
This is the config with the problem:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmIconMan
*FvwmIconMan*nummanagers 1
*FvwmIconMan*resolution  global
*FvwmIconMan*background  slategrey
*FvwmIconMan*foreground  white
*FvwmIconMan*font        7x13
*FvwmIconMan*buttongeometry    128x0
*FvwmIconMan*managergeometry    1x0-0-0
*FvwmIconMan*drawicons true
*FvwmIconMan*followfocus true
*FvwmIconMan*focusbutton up black white

You know, this command (without an asterisk) does not do anything.

Yes, I see the bug with "drawicons true".
But "drawicons false" and "drawicon always" work fine.

I've this very annoying problem running JAVA gui on FVWM (2.4.15). The
buttons get lost/disapper in Java Windows. Resizing the window does not
resize the containers properly. This happens on FVWM on both AIX and
Linux. However, using another window manager, KDE/CDE the problem does not
happen. Any ideas, I like fvwm and would like to stay with it.


Thanks,
Mukesh

A bit of a coincidence, but I was just getting ready to post
a similar message.  I can add a bit of my info as well:

In my case I'm running a PC w/Linux.  I've tried numerous
versions of FVWM (2.4.15/2.5.6).  If I switch to GNOME
or KDE, things work fine.  I'm actually running my Java
applet on a remote machine with the display set to my
machine.  In my case, the problem seems to
be intermittent... about 70% of the time, things work, sometimes
they don't.  Seems like when I start the applet up, if things
work, they always work, but if it fails, my program's GUI
hangs, and I have to kill it.

In my case too, the problem seems to effect primarily windows
which have a title bar on them (with the exception of the primary
window)  If the new window that comes up has a title bar, things
are pretty much hung.  Non-titled dialog boxes seem to
get handled fine.

In addition, for the main window of this program, if I set it such
that on startup a portion of the window occurs offscreen, when I pull
the window onto my visible desktop, the program acts like it doesn't
see that section... even if I do a resize, this "missing area" always
ends up non-renderred.

Another weird thing I noticed... I can run the exact same program
on a MUCH slower machine with the same configuration (redhat 9 and
same .fvwm2rc file), and things always work. (or at least, I was
10 for 10, whereas in the other machine, I was 1 for 10)

The "slow" machine is an old 200Mhz Compaq, and "fast" machine is
I believe a 1.8Ghz Dell Laptop.

If your version supports Layer style (at least 2.5.[56] do), you
could supply the maximum layer number (see fvwm(1) man page) as
a style for your application.  Otherwise, search for "StayOnTop" in
the man page.

I don't understand the question.  If the parent FvwmButtons dies,
so do all of its panels (unless you specified the NoClose option).

In fvwm-2.5.x you can fine tune the placement algorithm to avoid
placing windows over specific other windows.  Look for
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties and
MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties in the man page.

I suggest you send a bug report to the Java folks.  Fvwm is not
responsible for the internal resizing of windows.

Fixed.  You should remove the GrabFocusOff and GrabFocusTransient
styles from the installed ConfigFvwmDefaults.

Hi there!

I put an announcement on Symlink [1], a swiss portal to
IT/Linux/OS/..-related news, that the fvwm.org website has been
reworked. Also, I told them about the upcoming birthday and the logo
contest. If you like, have a look. There's also a discussion going on.

Sorry, it's German only. At least, you have to understand German. But I
guess if you post a comment in English, the responses will be in
English, too.

I think Mario means "when the parent FvwmButtons is hidden".

I don't think it is currently possible with nested subpanels, the
expanding/unexpanding of subpanels does not seem to be programmable.

Do you have in your fvwm config line(s) which looks like:

Style * NoPPosition

?

I've noted enormous redrawing problems with this style and java. I
suggest you remove such lines (if any) and add at the end of your
config file the line:

Style * UsePPosition, UseTransientPPosition

with 2.5.6 you may also add:

Style * FixedPPostion

Our libraries aren't installed in the usual place and now that I've added
--with-xpm-includes and --with-png-includes switches to configure I have a
fvwm with xpm and png. Now I'll start again playing with fvwm-themes.
Thanks for the hint.

good guess, both your assumptions happened. I had lost xpm support
cause our libraries/includes are not installed in the usual place.
And while I was playing with the new fvwm I commented out all
IconBox instructions but I forgot the "Style * NoIcon".
I've reconfigured/recompiled fvwm now with xpm/png support and I've got my
icons back.

Thanks

Hello,

on www.fvwm.org you have the page "Fvwm - Links" and there the section 
"Other Window Managers". There are only 2 managers listed yet. I am sure 
that xfce is based on fvwm, too. The configuration commands do look 
nearly the same as in fvwm.

Are there any other window managers based on fvwm?

Gert

I do not user emacs, but 'mc' while browsing the 'man' directories... 
If I find what I need I hit <F3> and have search functions with <F7>

The other thing is, that you can make a Menu-Point like

+ "Manpage: fvwm%32x32.help.xpm%"       Exec exec xterm -g 68x45-0-5 -fn \
        9x15 -fb 9x15bold -T "Manpage: fvwm2" -n "fvwm2" -e mcview \

I like this

Hi there,

I was just wondering if is it possible to place a particular program =
window in a specific location on the screen. I can place the KDE =
programs using geometry (ie. kword -geometry 600x600+0+0). However I =
cannot find a way to do it for programs like gmplayer or gflashplayer.

Any help in this matter would be most appreciated.

Hi All:

given the history of java and fvwm, I'm probably venturing down the road 
to hell, but here goes:

has anyone out there managed to get FvwmButtons to swallow a java app?

when I try it, the java window disappears the way it should, and the 
button changes from the pushed-in look to normal, but it stays blank.

i'm running fvwm 2.5.2 on solaris 8, java sdk 1.4.0_01

thanks!

You are right, xfwm should be added.

There was a very old fvwm95 hack, maybe to add it for the sake of the
history.

Ok, just searched for "based on fvwm" in Google. There are some
revelations. Some links suggest these window managers are based on FVWM:

  * Bowman (well, this is the AfterStep predecessor)
  * AmiWM (unlikely, the sources have no any indication)
  * Lesstif-MWM (it is true, but this WM was abandoned on Feb 1997)
  * Enlightenment (I think it was true in the very earlier versions)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Enlightenment was initially based on fvwm 1.x, but after the first couple 
of enlightenment releases, rasterman decided to start from scratch. So 
yeah, the first versions were fvwm based, but none after that.

>From this it seems that you have a 8bit/24bit display and the default
visual used is 8bit (this can be changed by the system administrator
only I think). With 2.5.5 without option the default visual is used so
you run fvwm with at most 256 colors as your display can support 2^24
colours! You should start fvwm as

	fvwm --visual TrueColor

or

	fvwm-themes-start -- --visual TrueColor

With 2.5.6, the situation is auto-detected and no option is needed.
Any way I strongly recommend the use of 2.5.6 (or a recent snapshot)
under your situation. I will be interested by the result of an upgrade
to 2.5.6 (as now I do not understand the "parse_colorset" error msg).

It only describes how to remove single bindings. However, I thought there is 
a command to remove all internal bindings. This would avoid problems when 
new bindings will be added in the future (or won't there?).

A crude way is to create permutations (or is it combinations?) of
all the keys & mouse buttons mapping to '-'; stick them in a file of
its own; then 'Read' it in before normal key bindings.

Here is one untested way to generate the syntax which are bound by
single modifier & in single context for ASCII values in [33,126] ...

  #!perl -w

  use strict;

  my @context = qw/A R T F W D S/;
  my @modifiers = qw/M S C N A L 1 2 3 4 5/;
  my @characters = ( map( 'F' . $_ , (1..12) )
                   , map { chr $_ } ( 33 .. 126 )
                   );

  for my $context ( @context )
  { for my $mod ( @modifiers )
    { for my $char ( @characters )
      { printf "key  %s %s %s -\n" , $char , $context , $mod;
      }
    }
  }

That would miss keys like "Help" (Sun keyboard).

A little less extreme is a PipeRead script reading and extracting
all the "Key" commands from ConfigFvwmDefaults, but its not like a
new builtin keybinding is added every day.

As far as I can see, there is no command to remove all key bindings.

( some code )

That is true; as i said 'untested way'... here is slightly better
one (supply appropriate locale/font/keyboard type as they appear in
X11 keysymdef.h if 'latin1' default is not desired) ...

  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
  use strict;

  #  X11 file containing key symbol definitions
  my $keysym = '/usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h';

  make_noop( find_keysym($keysym) );

  #  create no-op key bindings
  sub make_noop
  {
    #  see fvwm(1) man page for what it is context & what is modifier
    #  following collection is from version 2.5.6
    my @context = (0..9 , qw/A R T F W D S [ ] - _ < > ^ v I/);
    my @modifiers = (1..5 , qw/M S C N A L/);

    for my $context ( @context )
    { for my $mod ( @modifiers )
      { for my $key ( @{$_[0]} )
        { printf "key %s %s %s -\n" , $key , $context , $mod;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  #  set keyboard types to search for (as they occur in keysymdef.h)
  sub kbd_type
  { my $regex = shift;
    return ( scalar @ARGV
            ? map { s/$regex/$1/; $_; } @ARGV
            : qw(latin1)
          );
  }

  #  returns key symbols w/o 'XK_' prefix from a given file, most likely needs
  #  to be as X11 keysymdef.h
  sub find_keysym
  {
    my $keysym = shift;

    open KEYSYM , '<' , $keysym or die "cannot open $keysym: $!\n";

    #  save the key symbol matching pattern as it is used in more than one place
    my $sym = qr/[_[:alnum:]]+/;
    my $xk_sym   = qr/(?i:XK_) ($sym)/x;
    my $xk_opt_sym = qr/(?i:XK_)? ($sym)/x;

    #  create regex to find the (starting of) appropriate #ifdef section(s)
    my $start =
      '(?i:'
      .  join( '|'
            , map { 'XK_' . $_ } ('MISCELLANY', kbd_type($xk_opt_sym))
            )
      . ')';

    $start = qr/^ \#ifdef \s+ $start/x;

    #  regex to search & extract the 'XK_' lines/keys
    my $extract = qr/^ \#define \s+ $xk_sym/x;

    my @keys;
    while ( defined (my $line = <KEYSYM>) )
    { if ( ($line =~ /$start/) .. ($line =~ /^#endif/) )
      { next unless $line =~ m/$extract/;
        push @keys , $1;
      }
    }

    close KEYSYM or die "cannot close $keysym: $!\n";

    return \@keys;
  }
  __END__


...Mind you, if above is run over all the extracted '#define's in
keysymdef.h, about 11 MB output is generated.

How about this then (just to remove the bindings)...

  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
  use strict;

  #  fvwm default key bindings
  my $key_file = '/usr/X11R6/share/fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults';

  make_noop( find_keys($key_file) );

  #  create no-op key bindings
  sub make_noop
  { printf "%s -\n" , $_ for @{$_[0]};
  }

  #  returns key bindings minus the binded action from fvwm default key
  #  bindings
  sub find_keys
  {
    my $key_file = shift;

    open FILE , '<' , $key_file or die "cannot open $key_file: $!\n";

    #  regex to extract (save) key binding (until the binded action)
    my $extract = qr{^\s*( (?:Silent \s+)?
                          (key|mouse) \s+ \w+ \s+ \w+ \s+ \w+
                        ) .+
                    }ix;

Hello List,

I have a gnome-like panel and an extra panel to activate it (is that
clear?). Now i want also a key to activate it, like pressing Mouse 1 on
the Activate-Panel. Mhh...maybe i caould explain it so:

A "Gnome-Panel"

Is is always there and Gnome-Panel is a subpanel of A. In the moment i
have to click on it with the Mouse to toggle Gnome-Panel, but i want to
use simply a key... Hope it's clear now... :)

Mario

Hm, why not add a simple command like "ClearKeys" in the FVWM sources? I 
imagine that to be simpler and more reliable than all these Perl scripts. 
Maybe I'll check that out some day.

Anyways, thanks a lot for your effort, parv! These scripts look nice - I 
haven't tried them out yet, though.

Hello All:
   I could use some further enlightenment on
   the topic of key and mouse bindings.
   In the man pages, web site and config files
   I see examples of bindings, but I've not
   been able to see a breakdown of the components.
   For instance:

   Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
          ^ ^
          | |__ "Needs clarification"
          |__ "Needs clarification"

  Could someone please point me to some very basic
  docs on command structure?
  Web pages, man pages, keywords to search for etc...
  Using fvwm-2.4.15. on RH 7.2

  Kind regards

Its described in the fvwm man page under the "Mouse" command.
(Both commands use the same meanings.)

The "R" is the context (in this case Root).
The "A" is the modifier (in this case any modifier).

For me not a fvwm developer. :)

Actually, i am in favour of the above wish list item, but i do not
care much as long as i can override default/built-in key bindings by
some other means w/o much effort.

(I would like to say "Thank You" but that would not mean much unless
you still retain the same impression as above after testing the
program(s).)

Hello,

I've been updating my window decors for FVWM version 2.5.x as it's been 
developing.  Now that the feature set seems fairly stable and the themes haven't 
changed in awhile, I put them up on my web site:

  http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm-decors.html

There are a couple of new themes that are a little more neutral than my usual 
somewhat over-the-top style, and there are a couple of new "feminine" ones too. 
As before, there's a tarball of everything you need except for the desktop 
backgrounds.

   I have a logitech mouse with four buttons and a wheel. all the 
buttons work when tested using xev:

   left button:		button 1
   pressing wheel:	button 2
   right button:		button 3
   turning wheel:	buttons 4&5
   side button:		button 6

   buttons 1 - 5 work as expected in fvwm but when I try to bind 
something to side button (6) it doesn't work and I get this error message:

[FVWM][ParseBinding]: <<ERROR>> Illegal mouse button in line 6 
WTSFI0123456789 N  rrrFunction

   here are relevant lines from the line from config file:

Mouse 6 WTSFI0123456789 N  testFunction

DestroyFunc testFunction
AddToFunc   testFunction
+ "M" Move
+ "M" Raise
+ "C" RaiseLower

   if I use e.g. 2 instead of 6 there's no error message and it works as 
expected.

   fvwm verion is 2.4.15 (debian unstable)

   I used to have the button 6 working before, I don't remember which 
fvwm version... (I don't have that config file anymore but I don't 
remember doing anything special)

   any ideas? TIA!

In versions before 2.5.x this sometimes worked, but not reliably
and only by coincidence.

  2.4.x:

    Buttons 1 to 5 fully supported
    Buttons 6 and above not supported at all

  2.5.x:

    Buttons 1 to 5 fully supported
    Buttons 6 to 9 partially supported (as far as X allows)
    Buttons 10 and above not supported at all

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

   wow! I had it working before, I think it was 2.2.x, I thought it's 
not a big deal, a button is a button is a ... any chances it will be 
supported in 2.4?

   what do you mean by "partially supported"? can you bind functions to 
click/doubleclick/drag in 2.5? [any docs on this?]

   thanks,

Hi

I run a Debian Sid system, and i would like to try fvwm...

But when i try to run it, i got the following error (to get this error, i have 
killed the running wm and run fvwm from a previously opened terminal)...

bouil@lisa:~$ fvwm2
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: WARNING -- can't get fontset fixed, trying:
        -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
[FVWM][GetFontSetOrFixed]: ERROR -- can't get fontset:
        -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

What's wrong. Notice it's a freshly installed fvwm2, with default config.

Which config file must i modify to get fvwm working ?

Thanks !
Bouil.

I think that debian compile 2.4.x with --enable-multibyte. This is
not a good idea for various reason that I explain numerous time.

I suggest you compile yourself fvwm without any compile time option.

Hello List.

Some time ago I asked here how I could change the focus from :0.0 to :0.1
with keybindings.
Nobody knew it, and fvwm itself can't do it.

Now I found a solution!
I wrote a little shellscript:

#!/bin/bash

case "$DISPLAY" in
        :0.0)
                exec xwit -display :0.1 -root -warp 320 240
        ;;
        :0.1)
                exec xwit -display :0.0 -root -warp 640 512
        ;;
esac
exit 0

this script I put on a SHIFT+ALT+TAB and now I can switch between my
monitors without touching my mouse! :-)

Regards
	Klaus

Hmm.  xwit.  Never heard of.  Looks like a neat utility.

> monitors without touching my mouse! :-)

Personally, I use a program called warp-pointer, which is written by
Kjetil T. Homme (you can get it from
ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/people/kjetilho/warp-pointer.tar.gz).  Looks like
xwit may be just as useful (or more), though.

In my .fvwm2rc (I use C-+ to switch display):
# Swap between multiple displays
Key Plus		A	C	Exec exec warp-pointer

Hello,

I want to do the following:

If a program needs user-input and the program-window is eighter hidden 
behind other windows or minimized, I would like this program-window brought 
to the front and focesed. I don't want this behaviour for all windows 
though, only a few (fx. my messenger). So I was wondering whether Fvwm (or 
X) keeps some kind of list of programs which needs user-input- and how to 
access this list?

Thanks
/Peter

Hello again,

I was wondering which GUI-libs Fvwm is based on (qt, gtk ...) and whether 
this librari contains all the common GUI-elements (textbox, button, 
radiobutton etc) that is nomally associated with a desktop-system, and where 
I can find information about them?

Thanks
/peter

None.  It's all native fvwm code.

You can manually edit the file libs/defaults.h and increase the
value of the NUMBER_OF_MOUSE_BUTTONS macro from 5 to 9.  Do *not*
change the DEFAULT_ALL_BUTTONS_MASK and
DEFAULT_ALL_BUTTONS_MOTION_MASK macros, though.

X does not support all operatios on the additional mouse buttons
because it uses a bit mask to select events that drag the pointer
with a button held.  It has only five bits reserved for the
buttons.  There are a couple of things that do not work at all or
no reliably with buttons >= 6:

  - Interactive Move/Resize
  - Navigating menus
  - Running complex functions
  - The 'M' context in complex functions
  - Commands that change the focus or raise windows
  - Root window bindings
  - Stroke bindings

Some of these problems come only from the fact that fvwm often
waits for all buttons to be released before continuing.  These
problems would go away if we rewrite the function that checks
mouse button states without relying on the masks.

If you want just to write a dialog/menu that interacts with fvwm,
use FvwmGtk module, read its man page "man FvwmGtk" for a documentation.

In 2.5.x version you may also use perl class FVWM::Module::Gtk for this,
read "fvwm-perllib man FVWM::Module::Gtk" for a documentation.

Mikhael.

With 2.4.15 and 2.5.x you can use

  WindowId root 1 WarpToWindow 50 50
                ^
                |___ screen number

Hi,

	I have setup the keyboard shortcuts for CursorMove, but I would
like to be able to shortcut the 3 mouse buttons too. Could somebody tell
me how to do it?

	Thanks in advance!

Daniel.

Look for "FakeClick" in the man page.

I found it, but I tried many depth values and nothing happens. It works in
the background (no window under the mouse), but not inside, for example,
xemacs or netscape.

Also, the third button shortcut doesn't even work in the background
either, but this is less esential for me.

these are my settings:

# Move the cursor around
Key Left   A   M   CursorMove -5  0
Key Right  A   M   CursorMove +5  0
Key Up     A   M   CursorMove +0  -5
Key Down   A   M   CursorMove +0  +5
Key Left   A   MS  CursorMove -1  0
Key Right  A   MS  CursorMove +1  0
Key Up     A   MS  CursorMove +0  -1
Key Down   A   MS  CursorMove +0  +1  
Key 1      A   M   FakeClick depth 3 press 1 wait 200 release 1
Key 2      A   M   FakeClick depth 3 press 2 wait 200 release 2
Key 3      A   M   FakeClick depth 3 press 3 wait 200 release 3



Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

D.

What exactly are you trying to achieve?  Do you write your own
application or are you using one that someone else wrote?

If you are writing your own, your application can grab the focus
itself or use the UrgencyHint.  You should best look up how to do
this correctly in the ICCCM2 manual (link on our web page).

If you are using another application, you can only hope that the
application focuses itself or uses the UrgencyHint.

Look for the term UrgencyFunc in the fvwm man page for details.
If it grabs the focus itself you can use FvwmAuto or FvwmEvent to
raise/deiconify/unshade the window automatically.

Finally, if it's a shell based application, you can use the
FvwmCommand module to tell fvwm to bring the window to the front.
Something like this should work:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmCommandS

  AddToFunc my_make_visible
  + I WindowShade off
  + I Iconify off
  + I Raise

The call the following from the shell

  FvwmCommand "Next (name-of-app-window) my_make_visible"

The name must be unique.
