Hi !

First: fvwm is great. Thank you ;)

But I don't like the standard behaviour how windows are put on the screen from left to right. I would like that they are created from top to bottom.

I asked this question a while ago, unfortunately the answer was "not possible". Now I have a little spare time and would like to implement that feature myself. Since this is the first time I would look into the fvwm2 source I some little hints where to start best...

TIA!

All the placement code is in fvwm/placement.c.  The two functions
you want to start looking at are SmartPlacement() and
CleverPlacement().  You should make this a style option similar to
th TBLR arguments of the IconBox style.  For the new style, you
have to touch

  style.c
  style.h
  window_flags.h
  fvwm.h (the flag for the style belongs into the 'style only'
          part of the flags)

And please don't forget to add a ChangeLog entriy for every
function you touch.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Hi!
Recently I started to use fvwm2 window manager 
after several years of fvwm usage. I have a .fvwmrc
file and I want to convert it somehow to .fvwm2rc
How can I do it? (Please don't suggest me to write
a new one from the scratch )
Thanks in advance

OK.

To convert to fvwm2, use the fvwmrc_convert script that comes with
fvwm2.

If you picked up a current 2.4.x release, you need a second
conversion, run fvwm24_convert after running fvwmrc_convert.

What a nice surprise from the beginning of the year!

I compiled 20020102 and feedback window works, title can handle kanji :)

Popup menu is a little weird. After I set the menu font, I can add a
menu with kanji correctly from FvwmCommand but if I include the same
exact command in .fvwm2rc, it won't show up correctly. The string is
not handled as multibyte characters. I thought the command will be fed
through the same process routine whether it was read from 
configuration file or invoked from FvwmCommand.

I installed it from source on my Windows 98 box last month.  I got X from

if fvwm would work, and damned if it didn't, right out of the box.

I thought your problem was about the size of the geometry window
in the first place. (?)

That may depend on the characters in the command.  What does it
look like?  Are there any characters that may be treated
differently by the shell than by fvwm.  What is the exact command,
and what are your language related settings?

My problem was that "can't read feedback window" in the first place.
And now it works correctly, I can read it. It is good. I am happy.

Never mind the popup issue. My XEmacs character coding was set
incorrectly. 

Everything I mentioned in this thread seems to work now. Thank you.

  Actually, this could be very much on topic.  Gnome and KDE apps seem
to have an associated *.desktop file, sort of like a Windows .PIF file.
If you execute "find / -iname *.desktop > x" you'll end up with a whole
bunch of files in the list.  One example is the serviceconf.desktop file

[root@localhost root]# cat /etc/X11/applnk/System/serviceconf.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Service Configuration
Name[ja]=............
Comment=Configure which services will be running when the system starts
Comment[ja]=..........................................................
Icon=serviceconf.xpm
Exec=/usr/bin/serviceconf
Type=Application
Terminal=false

  The "Exec=" gives the name of the executable.  Type the command
/usr/bin/serviceconf from a terminal in an X window, and serviceconf
comes up (asking for root password).  Answer, and it runs.  What would
be *REALLY* nice would be a script to list off the files, and parse
them for "Name=", "Icon=", and "Exec=", and then pipe commands to build
a menu on-the-fly.

  Oh... hello everybody.  I've been using FVWM2 for awhile, but I'm
still not very much past the newbie stage with it.  I'm running Redhat
7.2 on a 450 mhz Dell with 128 megs of RAM.  The latest versions of KDE
and Gnome find this a bit underpowered, and 7.1 wasn't much better.
That was what pushed me to FVWM2.  A pleasant side-effect is the ability
to customize my desktop.  I've got a minimalist approach with
FvwmIconMan on the bottom left and a modified FvwmButtons on the bottom
right.

fvwm-menu-desktop script that is installed with fvwm-2.4.x does this.
Read "man fvwm-menu-desktop", there are a lot of options.

Hi,

There was a program similar to what you are asking for in RedHat's 6.x
series, but it appears to have been droped.  It was called wmconfig and
used to search /etc/X11/wmconfig.  It also appears as if the program has
been updated (slightly) without the man page being updated since I no
longer have the directory /etc/X11/wmconfig, and yet it still works for
me (kind of...)

My memory may be fading right now, but I seem to remember a script
with a similar functionality to this in a previous dist. of fvwm2, but it
doesn't appear to be included in the version of fvwm2 I'm using at the
moment...  Does this ring a bell with anyone?

$ rpm -q fvwm2
fvwm2-2.2.4-9

Hope this helps,

Tom

It was still in RH 7.1, which I'm running (I'm sure because a submenu of
my root menu uses it.)
But the script reads a directory structure in /etc/X11/applnk/ (and
perhaps /etc/X11/wmconfig, if that's present, I can experiment some more
if need be.)

Hello,

It would be nice if it were possible to start other window
managers from within fvwm2 in such a way that when the started
window manager is exited fvwm2 is restored. This makes it possible
to test applications under different window managers without
having to exit each window manager individually and reopen
all the windows that were on the desktop.

Alternatively is there a way to exit fvwm2 without quitting X
so as to temporarily obtain undecorated windows.

BTW, thanks to all fvwm2 developers. Keep up the good work!

Thanks,

  debian works that way, most of the WMs in debian have menu that
enables you to run other WM (WMs, like other apps, are automatically
added to system menu when they are installed).

  this is the relevant menu:

DestroyMenu "/Debian/WindowManagers"
AddToMenu "/Debian/WindowManagers" "WindowManagers" Title Top
+ "&9Wm" Restart 9wm
+ "&AfterStep" Restart /usr/X11R6/bin/afterstep
+ "A&fterstep Classic" Restart /usr/X11R6/bin/asclassic
+ "&Blackbox" Restart /usr/bin/blackbox
+ "&Ctwm" Restart ctwm
+ "&Enlightenment" Restart /usr/bin/enlightenment
+ "&Fvwm" Restart /usr/bin/X11/fvwm2
+ "&Gwm" Restart gwm
+ "&IceWM" Restart /usr/bin/X11/icewm
+ "&KDE" Restart /usr/bin/kde2
+ "&Modules" Popup "/Debian/WindowManagers/Modules"
+ "&Sawfish" Restart sawfish
+ "S&cwm" Restart /usr/bin/X11/scwm
+ "&Twm" Restart twm
+ "&Vtwm" Restart vtwm
+ "&Window Maker" Restart /usr/bin/wmaker
+ "&XFwm/XFce" Restart startxfce
+ "&aewm" Restart /usr/bin/aewm
+ "&lwm" Restart /usr/bin/X11/lwm
+ "&qvwm" Restart /usr/X11R6/bin/qvwm
+ "&uwm" Restart /usr/bin/X11/uwm
+ "&wm2" Restart /usr/bin/X11/wm2

  that's for fvwm, other WMs often have the same ability (not all, they
said kde wm cannot do that...)

> Alternatively is there a way to exit fvwm2 without quitting X

  that depends on how you start fvwm - if you start it as last command
in .xinitrc (in your home dir or system one or .xsession if you use xdm)
then X considers the exit of fvwm to be the end and quits - you would
need to replace fvwm with something else as last command (any X program
that wouldn't exit - xterm, xeyes, whatever, just remember that when you
quit that program X exits).

  I use xdm so I put the WM in ~/.xsession:

jojda:~...cvs/OpenRaider-0.0.2>cat ~/.xsession
# alternative to system, I just want to start x-window-manager,
# not x-session-manager

x-window-manager

# end

  x-window-manager is link to fvwm (debian alternatives system). if I
would want to use other program as 'anchor' I'd replace x-window-manager
line by something similar to the following lines:

x-window-manager& # starts in background
xterm             # when you quit this, X exits

  you can also:

  - start another X server (you can start plain X if you don't want
default window manager)

  - start nested X (never tried it)

  - start vncserver and use x vncviewer to view it within your current X
session (that's how I tested fvwm configuration)

  etc. there are probably other ways...

Hi all,

I have a little problem with FvwmScript's "MiniScroll" objects (for
example, the ones used to change Hours and Minutes in FvwmScript-Date
example.)

The problem is that it is quite difficult to make a mouse click short
enough to change the object's value by 1 unit only.
With some kinds of mouses this is even impossible, and the shortest
click makes the value increase/decrease at least by 2 units.

Is there a way to configure the repetition rate or mouse sensitivity
for this purpose?

Thank you for any help!

No, this is not configurable, indeed there is a duplication when you use a
mouse. I will commit a fix in a few minutes.

But in the latest versions (check out 2.4.4) you may also use a keyboard
arrows to change the value in +1/-1. Pressing Tab or Shift-Tab circulates
through widgets.

Mikhael.

OK, I've tried it and it works.
Anyway, using a mouse is important for my application.

I've always found this to be the simplest approach, in my .xinitrc:

loopwm fvwm2 &
exec xlogout -iconic

The shell "loopwm":

#first run the wm, then prompt for which one to run next":
wm=$@
while [ 0 ] ; do
  $wm
  wm=`xprompt -geometry +100+100 -re -warp -rlen 44 -p 'WM/end (fvwm2, twm, mwm, olwm)'`
  if [ $? != 0 ] ; then
    exit
  fi
  if [ "$wm" = "end" ] ; then
    exit
  fi
done

You'll probably need to download xprompt and  xlogout, for some reason
they are not included with most X packages.

xlogout holds the session, click on the icon, then
click on "logout" to exit X.
xprompt and loopwm lets  you start up any  window
manager or any other program in place of the window manager.
xprompt and loopwm also protect you from window manager crashes,
through I don't see many of those.

Hi all,

I attempted to search for a solution to this problem on Google, but to no
avail.  I would like to draw upon your expertise.

Pine (the mailreader) sends an escape sequence to change the label for its
icon when new mail arrives and the window is iconified.  However, the
space allocated for the label by fvwm2 is fixed at the time the window is
iconified.  Therefore, the new label does not show in its entirety if it
is longer than the label at the time the window is iconified.  If I move
my mouse over the icon, however, the label is resized correctly (I have
sloppy focus on, which I assume makes a difference).

Is there a way to automatically resize the icon label with fvwm2 2.4?
Thanks for any help.

Tony

If I understand you correctly, this is not related to pine or xterm.

The width of the icon title in the collapsed state is always fixed, it is
comparable with the width of the icon itself. When you point to the icon
picture or title, the title is expanded fully if needed.

This is done intentionally, otherwise a long icon title (think Netscape)
would overlap all other icon titles in the raw. Several such long icon
titles may create bad visual effects if they are always fully expanded.

The expanding behaviour is the same for all focus policies, i.e. it works
on mouse enter and mouse leave rather than on focus.

Currently there is no way to change this feature that some of developers
consider very good. If you are not convinced that your desktop looks nicer
with short (fixed size) icon titles, you may fill a new feature request
using the web.

Regards,
Mikhael.

  Thanks to everybody who replied.  I've dug up the man file and
implemented FvwmMenu.  It did save me quite a bit of work.

Here is a simple .fvwm2rc that shows this:
#
DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
Module FvwmIconMan

DestroyFunc RestartFunction
AddToFunc RestartFunction
Module FvwmIconMan
#

Start fvwm with it and you'll get two FvwmIconMan modules, while
according to man fvwm only one should appear.

That is interesting.  On my setup, the width of the icon title in the
collapsed state is not fixed.  It is set to the minimum width necessary to
hold the text, and adjusted to hold new text when the mouse moves over it.
Even when the mouse leaves, the new width is retained.

Could this be an option that I have set in my .fvwm2rc?

Thanks,
Tony

Where did you see that?  It should have been:

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Module FvwmIconMan

DestroyFunc RestartFunction
AddToFunc RestartFunction
+ I Module FvwmIconMan

But, with recent releases, this would be better:

DestroyFunc 
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmIconMan

I don't see anything in the code or man page that would do that.
That doesn't mean it isn't there, I just don't see it.

Just to check, I just did:

xterm -name 12345678901234567890 -iconic

which gave me:

I also had it change icon names while it was iconified and it kept the
narrow icon title.

Maybe you have a patched fvwm?

I don't use the graphical icons.  When I iconify, all I get is the text
label.

Could that make a difference?

Sure it would make a difference, the normal width of the icon title
matches the width of the icon.

What is it you wanted it to do in this case?

As someone else mentioned if we let the icon title expand without limit,
Netscape will have the icon title go right across the screen.  Of course,
Netscape itself supplies and icon, so maybe the behavior of Netscape
would be different...

Ah, that explains things.

Is there a way to expand the icon title to dynamically match the width of
the text (in the case of not having a graphical icon)?  I wouldn't mind
doing the coding myself, but I'd like some pointers to the areas of code
to poke around in.

Thanks,
Tony

It does make a difference and it's a bug.  I'll see what I can do.

No, he's right.  Try this:

  Style rxvt Icon missing_icon.xpm
  Style rxvt IconTitle
  Style rxvt SloppyFocus

(with an icon file that does not exist).  Now, create an rxvt and
run bash or zsh in it (may work with other shells too, but no
guarantees):

  $ rxvt

Then in the shell in the rxvt:

  $ echo "\[\e]1;short_icon_title\007"
 
This sets the icon title to "short_icon_title".  Next, type

  $ echo "\[\e]1;a_much_looooooooonger_icon_title\007"

but don't press return yet.  Iconify the rxvt and move the pointer
over it to focus it.  The icon title shows the complete text.
When you now hit return, the title expands to fit the new, longer
icon title, but when you move the pointer away from the icon, it
collapses to the size of the old icon title.  To clarify this, I
attached three screenshots.  It looks like the icon title width is
not updated while the title is expanded.

---

BTW, what is the right way to disable icons but show icon titles?
I found no other way than specifying an illegal pixmap file.  If I
have a default icon, I see no proper way to disable pixmaps for
certain applications.

It all became clear to me once Tony explained that he wasn't using
icons, only icon titles.

Although icon titles without icons work with FVWM,
its not really supported in the sense that there is no clean way
to turn it on.  (I guess if you never define a default icon its on.)

Wouldn't FvwmIconMan do a better job?

If we did want to make this a viable option, I think we'd need
some way to limit the width of the title, left and right adjust it...

I just finished fixing it myself.  It appears to work, though I wonder if
I did it right. :)

Thanks to everyone who helped me with this.

  Let me start off by saying that yes, I do have "IgnoreModifiers L25"
in my .fvwm2rc file.  I'm running fvwm 2.4.4.  I can {ALT-TAB} between
programs with any combo of Caps/Num/Scroll Lock active.  However, I
can't jump to a window by clicking on a title on FvwmIconMan if either
Num or Scroll Lock is active.  Caps Lock does not interfere.

  I'm running a simple configuration.  I want to build it up from
scratch, partly to have full control, partly to learn the guts of FVWM.

Now I'm confused...
I have a similar problem where the Eterm I launch at startup gets
launched again when I restart.  This is undesireable behaviour.
Is there a different place I'm supposed to put it, or how does that work?
I have this:

AddToFunc StartFunction     
+ I Exec Esetroot -f /usr/share/pixmaps/vpm_wp_01_1024.jpg &
+ I Exec Eterm -g 26x21+0+552 -F 5x7 -O -T XMessages -e tail -f
$HOME/.X.err 
+ I Module FvwmButtons
+ I Module FvwmTaskBar

I do not have an InitFunction or RestartFunction section. 
The modules don't seem to be double-started, but the eterm does.
I don't know about the background, since that's kinda hard to test...
*sigh*

Well, if you read the man page (you did, right?), you should find that
StartFunction is executed on both start-up and restart.

The modules are part of FVWM and they are killed on quit or restart.
So, if you don't want Eterm to be launched twice, don't request this.

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmButtons
+ I Module FvwmTaskBar

AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec Esetroot -f /usr/share/pixmaps/vpm_wp_01_1024.jpg
+ I Exec Eterm -g 26x21+0+552 -F 5x7 -O -T XMessages -e tail -f $HOME/.X.err

Well, it does.

To be honest, I simply have some title-only icons because the
pixmap wasn't in the path anymore after some OS update.  Or
perhaps I renamed it and didn't update the config file - whatever.
And then I left it that way for testing purposes.

Perhaps we'd better have named it "InitRestartFunction" to avoid
the confusion about the names.

Hm, yes.  The IngoreModifiers command works only in fvwm itself,
not the modules.  Thanks for the report.

Yeah, I did...

Oh.  That explains why the modules weren't started twice.  That confused
me, as did the StartFunction being executed both at start-up and
restart.  It kinda makes RestartFunction seem a bit redundant if that's
the case.  The man pages don't really give much in the way of examples and
typical usage, and the sample system.fvwm2rc doesn't even have a
StartFunction section at all.
I learn best by example.

You look at your old system.fvwm2rc, it's not overwritten on installation.
All four sample.fvwmrc/system.fvwm2rc* files shipped with fvwm-2.4.* have
StartFunction, some have InitFunction as well.

I wrote a trivial hack for this in 1996, which allows:

  Icon NoPixmap

to turn off icons, even for motif apps that supply them (such as netscape).
It was in the code back them, but I switched to using FvwmIconMan a long
time ago, so I don't know if its still there in the latest. grep icons.c
for "NoPixmap".

There was no option to limit title width, but in those days people
generally set more reasonable titles on their web pages :-)

Doesn't crash for me.  Which version are you using?  Can you fetch

I use fvwm-2.4.4, it crashed whan it was 2.4.0 also.

(gdb) where
#0  0x401c9239 in malloc () from /lib/libc.so.6

#13 0x4017465f in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6

actually this is for fvwm configured as follows:
        ./configure  --prefix=/usr\
        --sysconfdir=/etc/X11/fvwm --bindir=/usr/X11R6/bin\
        --libexecdir=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11 --libdir=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11\
        --mandir=/usr/X11R6/man --without-gnome\
        --without-rplay-library --without-stroke-library\
        --enable-multibyte

If I remove '--enable-multibyte' stack content looks like

(gdb) where

Funny, that doesn't look like an fvwm stack trace at all.  Did you
compile fvwm with full debug info?  Does gdb say that the core
file was generated by fvwm?  This really looks as if the libc
started an X application on its own.  There must be some kind of
reference to the program somewhere.

Oh...
I kinda wish it was, or that the new samples were put somewhere
convenient.  Maybe in /usr/libexec/fvwm/2.4.4/samples/ or on www.fvwm.org?

Hello-

I prefer fvwm2 about version 2.0 (typical with RH 5.2 thru RH 6.0). 
Also, I
prefer many features of RH 7.2.  So, I have been trying to comgine them.

I tried starting with a new installation (enigma) of RH7.2, removing
fvwm2 using
rpm, then installing the older fvwm2 using rpm, but I got conflicting
dependent
files.

I tried starting with a new installation (Manhattan) of RH5.2, and
adding
features I wanted from RH7.2 and got even worse snags.

Has anyone been down this path before and made better progress?

Hi!

I'd like to give focus to newly popped up windows.
This works, but sometimes (often on startup) the cursor becomes a +, and
needs a click (I don't know why...)

Any idea?

You probably have some function in your configuration file that
requires a window when no window has focus.  For example, if you
had

  AddToFunc StratFunction
  + I move

in your config file, the "move" operation doesn't know what window
to operate on and asks the user instead.  If you can find out the
responsible command, you can suppress the feedback by adding
"silent" before the command:

  + I silent move

But on the other hand you can probably just remove the command.
To pin it down a working approach would be to remove the commands
from your config file successively to find out which one causes
the problem.

Okay, so I'll take a shot at this.

Why do you prefer fvwm2 about version 2.0?

It sounds as if what you are saying is that you like the "default"
fvwm2 setup present in RH 5.2 - 6.0.  If this is  the case, just install
the AnotherLevel package and the current version of fvwm2.  Everything
will probably work fine.  There may be one snag, some variables like
ImagePath and such have been changed, so you'll have to bring the
AnotherLevel package up to date, but that's not hard...

If this is not the case, just download a source rpm and build whatever
version you want.  Install it and so on...

One thing I liked better on fvwm2 version 2.2 over version 2.4 was when
I used the windowshade function it did not put the window border on the
bottom of the shaded window (titlebar) on the old version and it does on
the new version.  The new version is prettier, but the border on the
bottom just gets in the way too often.

Hello.

Why do fvwm calls XGrabServer in the beginning of outline windows
moves and resizes and UnGrab in the end? is this a performance
question?

The outlines are xored onto the screen and erased with another
xor.  If the server wasn't grabbed, other applications could
draw on the xor in between and the erase wouldn't work.

Ahh.. I have a problem. Being a debian's fvwm maintainer I got a bug
report on it. User complains that outline processes makes some
X-applications stop and even stops xmms playing for him. And so he
think this is a bug.

BTW, outlines could be erased by updating places they've been, or
could not?

Xor outlines are used as a speed up, if the user doesn't want
the server grabbed, have them use opaque resizes and moves.

To redraw under the lines, you'd have to save the area under the
lines and redraw it, or create the lines in shaped windows,
it wouldn't be fast anymore.

  I have a similar problem in RedHat 7.2 with moving of outlines and
*ANY* audio application (e.g. RealPlayer).  I understand that this is a
generic problem with X, where video card drivers don't play by the rules.
A PCI device is supposed to check whether the PCI bus is busy before
sending data.  If it doesn't, you get conflicts with devices (e.g. PCI
soundcard and PCI videocard) fighting for resources.  There may be an
option when starting X to control this, but I forget.

  I've started off with the barest ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc file, and am
building up from scratch.  I notice that grabbing the sides or corners
changes the cursor, but does not enable moving or re-sizing.  I have to
click on the leftmost button, and use the menu.  This is probably due to
my barebones .fvwm2rc file.  What style commands should I use to enable
moving/resizing by clicking with the cursor ?  Even better, can somebody
please point me to the appropriate manpage, so I can read up in depth ?

Did you remove the ConfigFvwmDefaults file?
The ability to resize a window by dragging on the corner
is in that file.  The builtin commands are described in
the fvwm2 man page under "BUILT IN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS".

I don't think the PCI bus has anything to do with it.

I don't think its a generic problem with X either.

These CD players need to separate the updating of the display
from the logic that plays the CD.  Being late in updating the
display would not bother the user, but not playing sounds
is understandably disturbing.

Thats normally done with multithreading.

After you install 2.4.4, you will find it contains 2 conversion
scripts, fvwmrc_convert and fvwm24_convert.  These 2 scripts
will change your .fvwm2rc file so that it works with 2.4.4.

Read the man page for both scripts.

Hi all,

I know this is an old topic (as there are many messages in the archives
regarding key bindings) but I have a question that I did not see asked
there --

My key bindings go away.

All of them -- modifiers + keys, modifiers + mouse buttons,
etc.  Everything except basics (like resizing windows and moving them).  I
have a friend who's having this problem as well -- we are both running
Debian "testing" and fvwm 2.2.5-1.1.  My keybinding fvwmrc code is as
follows:

Key p     A    MC   Exec exec xmms --pause
Key Next  A    MC   Exec exec xmms -f
Key Prior A    MC   Exec exec xmms -r
Key Home  A    MC   Exec exec aumix -v +3
Key End   A    MC   Exec exec aumix -v -3
Key x     A    MC   Exec exec xmms
Key t     A    MC   Exec exec xterm -bg black -fg white -cr lightblue +sb
Key n     A    MC   Exec exec netscape

Key space A    M    Maximize 100 100
Key Tab   A    M    Next [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab   A    MS   Prev [CurrentPage !iconic] focus-and-raise
Key Tab   A    CM   Next [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus
Key Tab   A    CMS  Prev [CurrentPage] deiconify-and-focus
Key Left  A    C    Scroll -100 +0
Key Up    A    C    Scroll +0 -100
Key Right A    C    Scroll +100 +0
Key Down  A    C    Scroll +0 +100

In addition, our bindings work when fvwm is started up -- restarts don't
fix the problem.  The bindings work for a little while (don't know how
long they last or what breaks them), and then they're gone (whoosh).

Does anyone know what might be happening?

Hmm, did you read question 0.1 in the FAQ?

Hi,

Since you started with 2.0.43, you should first run fvwmrc_convert
and then run fvwm24_convert.  Since neither conversion is perfect,
you should look at each file after the conversion.

After the conversions, there should not be a ModulePath statement
in your config file $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.  If there is, remove it.

Also look for error messages being printed by fvwm during startup
on your console.

If you are still having problems, post the parts of your config
file that are not working.  To start a module, you should have
something like this in your config file:

AddToFunc StartFunction "I" Module FvwmTaskBar

PS: Please don't send html to this list, some of the readers
of this list don't like it.

fvwm.org mailing lists seem to be protected by anti-spam system.
>From my experience you should wait for 24 hours until this link
  http://spamcop.net/w3m?action=checkblock&ip=213.165.64.100
does not list gmx.de as a spammer host and try to send a message again.
If spammers send another stuff in the comming 24 hours wait again...
The actual blocking penalty time may be different.

Regards,
Mikhael.

That site is blocked; the referenced URL includes complete info.

Blocklist query for 213.165.64.100
213.165.64.100 is and should be blocked:16.98% spam rate exceeds 2% threshold

Too much spam is spewing from that particular host.  When the spam
stops, the statistics will decay automatically and the site will be
delisted.  Until more spam arrives, of course.

I'm not the mailing list administrator, but I went the the above URL
and entered a query, this was the result:

Blocklist query for 213.165.64.100
213.165.64.100 is and should be blocked:16.98% spam rate exceeds 2% threshold

Perhaps you should complain to your ISP?

  Which I tried and it didn't seem to work.  I checked the website, and
it mentioned fvwm@fvwm.org, which seems to work.  Anybody else have this
problem ?

It should be working; I see nothing that would make it not work, and
this message is sent to that address.  Perhaps you could be explicit
about how it failed to work.

I have removed references to the old address from the list info file.

Is there another way to unsubscribe besides sending a mail where the FROM:
part contains my subscription adress? What if the spam rate never goes
under the 2% treshhold?

  Thanks to everybody for putting up with my qustions so far.  I've
finally gotten to the point where the man pages make sense, and I'm
writing my own specs instead of blindly copying+pasting other peoples'
code.  I've made several modifications to FvwmButtons, and it's at the
end of this message with lines quoted by "> " to protect against
linewrap.  My problem is that I'm still not sure of the exact syntax to
use with the "Inline" Menu config group.  I've done a search of the
FVWMman page, and only found examples of DestroyModuleConfig.  What I'm
looking for is an explanation or more examples of the syntax in the
statement where FvwmPager is swallowed, below.

That means that fvwm does not manage the window.  Such windows are
of course undecorated and can not be raised, lowerd or manipulated
in any way.  However, a few day ago I made a fix in fvwm for a
problem with undecorated windows.  Can you please try the latest
snapshot to see if the problem goes away?

If the problem persists, please try to strip down your config file
to the minimum that shows the bug.  Probably it will still occur
without a configuration file at all.

You can't make calculations in fvwm commands.  Use the shell via
PipeRead instead:

  Key Left FSTW SCM PipeRead "echo MoveToPage $[$[page.nx]-1] $[page.ny]"

By the way, you switched the x and y coordinate in your command
above.

=09ah... I missed that point... but anyway, it's not working...  I tried =

redirect the ouput to a file so I could look to what was being echoed, an=

found that I only got the values of -1, 0, and 1. It seems that the=20
$[page.nx] are not evalueted by FVWM before it sends to shell, so the she=

doesnt know what is $[page.xx]. what I have to do now?

Hmpf.  It did *something* for me, but not exactly what it should.
The idea is right, but the quoting is wrong.  It's easier to write
this as a function because you don't have to think much about the
proper quoting.  Try these instead:

  AddToFunc page_right
  + I PipeRead echo\ MoveToPage\ $[$[page.nx]+1]\ $[page.ny]
  AddToFunc page_left 
  + I PipeRead echo\ MoveToPage\ $[$[page.nx]-1]\ $[page.ny]
  Key Right FSTW SCM page_right                                              
  Key Left FSTW SCM page_left 

This works for me.

Bye

I installed the latest snapshot as afviced (20020114).
And I tried to reproduce the unmanaged window problem, I never got an
unmanged window again, but once I got a popup saying something like:
XmPopup
XtGrabPointer failed

Now the window manager (or X) had hang (although ctrl-alt-backspace
worked, XFree86).
I run this applet from Netscape, so the message leads me to believe that
the origin of the problem is within (the statically linked) Motif
library of Netscape (4.76 on Linux x86).
The problem seems to arise because when you click on a contact 
a menu is popped up and on the second click (a double click) a message
dialog is opened (in a new window).
Maybe this window gets the menus properties of being unmanaged.
This would ofcourse be a bug in Netscape (not Fvwm).

I have set 
Style * MWMFunction
set in my config file. This makes the menualternatives like
resize,mimimize and so on grayed out for some windows based on hints.

Is it possible to get the same effect for windows that have styles such as
FixedPosition set? Ie. in this case it would gray out the menu item
corresponding to the function "Move".

Okay, that's a step in the right direction.

Unless the window is placed manually, fvwm does not grab the
pointer when placing windows (although it grabs the server, but
that shouldn't make a difference here).  Maybe the client does
something wrong in the calls to

If ctrl-alt-backspace still works, X does not hang.  This is
usually caused by an application grabbing the server and never
releasing it.  All other X programs appear to be frozen (including
the window manager).  Might that application be stupid enough to
grab the server and then grab the pointer?  Sou7nds a bit like
this.  If it would grab the server while another application had
grabben the pointer, the latter would never get the chance to
release the pointer again.

Can I get the source code of that application somewhere?

Normally, the caps-lock key is mapped to the 'lock' modifier on
your X server.  It seems that for some reason  this is not the
case on your machine.  The modifier 2 should be normally mapped to
num-lock, not caps-lock.  You can check which modifiers are bound
to which key by issuing

  $ xmodmap

on the command line.  You can either fix this or just use the
IgnoreModifiers command.  To get the bindings right, the commands

  $ xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
  $ xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
  $ xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
  $ xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"

should do (but that depends on how your xmodmap looks).  For a
more detailed description, please check Q 5.5 in the fvwm FAQ and
the xmodmap man page.

Not at the moment, but consider that implemented in a moment.  The
code is already there, but it checks only for the mwm hints.

I did a similar thing to allow title bar buttons to be drawn 'sunken' based on
the layer the window is in (I have title bar buttons set up to put the window
in layer 2, 4, or 6, as a kind of "stay on top", "stay on bottom" or "float
normally" facility).

I posted my patches (for 2.4.3 I think) to fvwm-workers last December : see

    http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0112/msg00093.html

but never got any feedback on them :-(

My patch basically just extended the set of 'MWM hints' to include a layer
number option.

Sorry.  At the moment, I'm very slowly working through the backlog
in my mail box.  I'll eventually get to the mails from last year,
but I can't promise anything.

This is a Java applet run in Netscape.
The URL to the applet is: http://web.icq.com/icqlite

Maybe it's possible to decompile the java byte code (I remeber I saw a
"decompiler" for Java byte code once).

That's great! Thanks a lot!
By the way, I noticed using the latest snapshot version, some programs
automatically gets a mini icon in the window list (kmail for example).
Is this specific for KDE apps? (I know it's possible to assign mini icons
manually in the config..)

The modules start OK for me.  I don't know why you are having
a problem.  You should look at the console for error messages.
You should at least be seeing:

[FVWM][menu_func]: <<ERROR>> No such menu Window Ops
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'MenuFont'
[FVWM][execute_function]: <<ERROR>> No such command 'MenuColors'

Urk!  It's a Java applet?  Come to think of it - maybe I don't
want to see the source code at all ;-)

I managed to decompile the applet (using a program called "jad")
I don't think I can give you the "source", that would probably be illegal
(although I already commited a crime by decompilation...)
But it's possible if tou really want....

(This reminds me of an old manual for building a modem for the VIC-20,
first there was a descriptoin on how to build a modem that you place
against the speaker of the phone.
Then came chapter 2 describing how to connect directly to the phone line.
It started: "This is illegal and you should not do this. OK, here how you
do it..." :) )

Yes, Olivier added an EWMH support in pre 2.5.0, which is on by default.
So KDE 2.x (and maybe GNOME 2.x) apps should be better integrated out of
the box. See the EWMH section in the man page, everything is configurable.

Hi,

The one window-related thing in fvwm I haven't been able to config to
my satisfaction is as follows: I use SloppyFocus and want a click inside
a window to raise it, which is easy. However, I also want to be able to
mark text in a window which is not on top without it raising to the top.

Is there any way of doing this in fvwm?

It won't help since I can't see the X function calls.

I don't think so.  When fvwm notices that you actually moved the
mouse it's already too late.

I am not sure to understand but what about marking the text using
the mouse + a modifier (as Shift). This may work with some app
and fail with others which can do somthing special if a modifier
is used (shift work with my xemacs). This may also interact with
your mouse bindings and with the IgnoreModifiers command.

Hi,

[I'm not subscribed to the list, but do read it on the Web after asking
 questions ;-)]

I suppose it is since updating from fvwm-2.4.0 to 2.4.4, I get these
log messages on my console:

[FVWM][LOG]: 18:36:00    158  Raise
[FVWM][LOG]: 18:36:22   2216  Raise
[FVWM][LOG]: 18:36:22     10  GotoPage 0 1
[FVWM][LOG]: 18:36:23     94  Raise
[FVWM][LOG]: 18:36:39   1614  Raise

And so on. Very informative, but I don't really want them normally.  :)

I don't know what has changed between these versions (well, I _do_
know, I can see the ChangeLog ;->). I suppose it has something to do
with FVWM_DEBUG_MSGS or FVWM_COMMAND_LOG.

My build configuration was identical for both versions:

--enable-static --enable-shared --with-glib-prefix=/opt/proj/WDM/tools 
--with-gtk-prefix=/opt/proj/WDM/tools --with-gnome=/usr/local
--enable-gnome --enable-move-bug-workaround --with-imlib-prefix=/usr/local
--without-mit-ext --enable-command-log
--with-stroke-includes=/opt/proj/WDM/tools/include

Could it be that the meaning of "--enable-command-log" has changed? A
look at configure.in tries to tell me that it now has the functionality
which used to be in "--enable-debug-msgs"?

Is there any way I can set this log off through runtime configuration?
Or "Misc Config Opts"?  :)

Or do I have to rebuild?

TIA,
Moritz

 In my menues, this is things like "ChangeDefaultFocus SloppyFocus".

I don't think so, the "--enable-debug-msgs" option is still there.

I think you have to rebuild.

No, I just didn't read the manual page carefully and typed even less 
carefully.  My keys aren't mismapped,  I guess my message should be 
that it would be nice if the num_lock was ignored by default.  I'm 
probably not the only person who doesn't think of num_lock as a 
global modifier.  Thanks

I just installed fvwm from the rpms on the fvwm site, but what I am having 
difficulty doing is figuring out how to get it up and running as my window 
manager. How exactly do I go about it? 

Sorry to be such a newb :)

  Not the way you're trying to do it.  When you mark text in a window,
you are in fact clicking inside the window... see the problem?  The way
around this is to *NOT* have clicks-inside-window raise the window.

Style * SloppyFocus
Style * ClickToFocusRaisesOff
Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

  Set up to raise the window when you click on any of the four sides

DestroyFunc RaiseOrMove
AddToFunc RaiseOrMove
+ I Raise
+ M Move

Mouse 1 ST      A       Function RaiseOrMove

  With this setup, I can focus in a window without raising it.  I can
even be typing away in a window while a smaller window is raised and
floating above it in a corner.

Well, fvwm can tell the difference. Marking is not clicking, it's
moving. Consider the titlebar. By default, clicking on it raises
the window, but moving (press and hold button, move mouse) moves the
window. And it's not necessary for the window to raise while it's moved.

So, what I want to do in 'fvwm-speak' is this:

Mouse 1 W       A       Current [ !Raised ] SomeFuction

and then have SomeFunction like this:

AddToFunc SomeFunction
+ C Raise
+ M Magic

Where the function Magic tells fvwm to let go and give control to the
client. Now that I think about it, FakeClick might be the solution. I'll
have to see. If I just pass a buttonpress to the client and not the
release?

> The way
> around this is to *NOT* have clicks-inside-window raise the window.

Yes, but that's trivial and also what I've been doing. With a Sun
keyboard, it's even pretty good as there's a 'Front' button which can
be used to raise the window.  However, with my Linux box at home I have
rather few keys as it's a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite.

There are several solutions, which may work depending on how you start the
X System. Try this one:

  % echo "fvwm2" >~/.Xclients

Then start X. If this still starts another WM, do the same with ~/.xinitrc.

When you start FVWM for the first time you may choose "Setup 95" from the
menu. Or compose your own customized ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc. Or install
fvwm-themes rpms and replace a call to "fvwm2" with "fvwm-themes-start".

Regards,
Mikhael.

All that information is available in the fvwm2 man page.

Title bars have 3 colors, depending on the state of the window.

AddToDecor MyDecor
+ TitleStyle Centered ActiveUp (Solid cornflowerblue -- Raised) \
             Inactive (Solid Navy -- Flat) \
             ActiveDown (Solid dimgrey -- Sunk)
Style "*" UseDecor MyDecor

The little icon is a miniicon:

Style * MiniIcon iconname

The taskbar will use the same miniicons.

You'll probably also have to make .Xclients executable:

  % chmod 755 ~/.Xclients

If you're at runlevel 5 (i.e. xdm) and using the gnome or kde login
screen you'll also need to select the "default" session type to have
xdm read your .Xclients.

Actually, I think nobody quite understands what you're trying to                
configure.                                                                      
                                                                                
Fvwm consists of a core and a bunch of modules like FvwmButtons.                
The modules must be started from within fvwm but run as separate                
processes.  Each module has a name beginning with "Fvwm" and has                
its own man page (man FvwmButtons etc.).  Lines beginning with an               
asterisk '*' are not handled by fvwm itself but are sent to any                 
module with the proper name:                                                    
                                                                                
  *FvwmButtons: Geometry ...                                                    
                                                                                
is sent to modules with the name "FvwmButtons".                                 
                                                                                
  *Inline: foobar                                                               
                                                                                
is sent to modules with the name "Inline".  Since all modules                   
coming with fvwm begin with "Fvwm" this is either a module                      
written by someone else (you can even write a shell script as a                 
module) or it is a module using an alias.  Some of the modules                  
allow to be started with a different name, e.g. FvwmButtons:                    
                                                                                
  *OtherButtons: ...                                                            
  ...                                                                           
  Module FvwmButtons OtherButtons                                               
                                                                                
This way you can have multiple instances of the same module using               
different configuretions, but it still parses the options                       
described in the module's man page.                                             
                                                                                
Hope this helps.  If not, please rephrase what you are trying to                
do.

I got fvwm working (many thanks to all who helped out), now I want to add 
some programs and such. Now, I am using one of the themes, Afterstep to be 
precise, and I don't really want to do all the heavy lifting of designing 
all the theme based stuff right now. Where do I find the fvwmrc file that is 
used by the theme? I haven't been able to find it with either a locate or 
find search.

Please read the supplied doc/FAQ, it should answer most of your questions.
Since you installed from rpm, just run "rpm -ql fvwm-themes-base". But
you don't need to change themes. Usual things a user wants to customize:

1) Add startup programs. Solution: create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/startup
which looks like:

  AddToFunc InitFunction
  + I Exec exec gtop
  + I FuncFvwmRunInXterm "Top" top  # one of the standard themed functions

2) Add your own menus. Solution: create ~/.fvwm/themes/personal/menus-extra
which looks like:

  AddToMenu MenuFvwmPersonal
  + "Something 1" something 1
  + "Something 2" something 2

Read the FAQ and other documentation in /usr/share/doc/fvwm-themes-0.6.0/
if you need to customize more things like the editor/terminal/browser used
or change/add more bindings.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I want to customize the windowlook. And when I set the button styles using ActiveUp,ActiveDown,Inactive, for example:
AddButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp Pixmap button/wm-window-close.xpm
AddButtonStyle 2 ActiveDown Pixmap button/wm-window-close-pressed.xpm
AddButtonStyle 2 Inactive Pixmap button/wm-window-close.xpm
I get a delay between pushing button and the action what is performed. Can I change that?

Hi all,

Is it possible to let fvwm wait for a command completion, or pause for
a certain amount of milliseconds, before executing the following action?

I'm looking for this kind of feature, because in my RestartFunction I have
this kind of operation sequence:

+ I FvwmM4 <file_to_be_read_with_FvwmM4>
+ I <function_which_is_declared_in_that_file>

and the sequence appears to be not synchronized (the function is not
executed
because not yet read, I think).

I tried with FakeClick wait <milliseconds>, but with no success.

Thank you for your help!

You may try to run FvwmM4 as follows:

ModuleSynchronous FvwmM4 -lock <file_to_be_read_with_FvwmM4>

I am not sure that this will work.

That depends on what action you have bound to the button.  If it
is a complex function with a double click action, fvwm can not
determine if you made a spimple or a double click until the
specified ClickTime was exceeded:

  ClickTime 500
  AddToFunc func1
  + C Raise
  + D Lower
  Mouse 1 3 N func1

The example above waits 500 milliseconds after a click before
actually raising the window.  The next one raises the window
immediately:

  ClickTime 500
  AddToFunc func1
  + C Raise
  Mouse 1 3 N func1

You can also use a smaller value for ClickTime (see man page).
The default value is 150.

Bye

Hi!

Could you guys consider changing the filename of fvwm_icons.tgz
to fvwm-icons-YYYYMMDD.tgz. Using the same name for different versions
causes checksum problems at least in NetBSD and FreeBSD package system...

Thanks,

Martti (who has been maintaining fvwm in NetBSD pkgsrc)

Hi,

I use fvwm2 from RH6.2 and met following config problems:

1.) when I use my own icons in /usr/local/my_icons - I put this line 
into .fvwm2rc as IconPath. For root, it is OK, but not for normal user. 
It always looks into /usr/share/icons. I don't know what is bad.

2.) Apps which have no icon are minimized only to their name. Is it 
possible to assign them some standard icon ?

3.) The icon placement on the workspace is very random without grid, I 
would like to have it on some grid but don't know how. The best way is 
to define places for some apps ( for example nedit will place its icons 
to top left corner, xterm to top right etc). Furthermore icons are 
two-color only...

Is it possible to do it or not ?

Thank you in advance

Vaclav

Is it the 'system.fvwm2rc' file you have changed? And not the one in
root's home directory. (maybe a stupid question of me...)

Yes, you can assign a standard icon with:
Style * some_icon.xpm

this gives apps that don't supply icon the icon some_icon.xpm

Yes, by using the IconBox style
for example:
Style "*"	    IconBox $[vp.width]x80+0-0

defines a box at the bottom of the screen 80 pixels high and the screens
width to place icons in. The icons will be placed from left to right,
don't know how to change this. This box is not visible on the screen, it's
only an imaginary box used to place icons. This is probably what you want.

The answers here are by default for 2.4.x versions, not 2.2.x.

The geometry-like syntax is only supported in 2.4.1 and greater.
This is more universal:

  Style nedit IconBox 10 10 300 300, IconGrid 64 10, IconFill Bottom Right
  Style xterm IconBox -400 -400 300 300, IconGrid 40 40, IconFill Left Top

Agreed, its hard for us to sort out when features appeared.

The older (non-geometry) syntax can do more.

The geometry syntax is valid in 2.2 and sometime before.
The variable came much later (than 2.2) I believe.

In current releases you won't see the random placement effect either
as there is a built in default box that covers the screen.

Is there any chance that it could be possible to change the appearence of
the move and resize feedback windows in a future version (I believe it's
currently not possible, or did I miss something?)
For example to show (x, y) instead of +x +y as it does now.
There could be options to leave out the plus sign for positive values for
exaple, maybe with some sort of format string.

That would be quite easy to do.  The format string is defined in
libs/defaults.h:

  #define GEOMETRY_WINDOW_POS_STRING         " %+-4d %+-4d "

At the moment, you would have to change that string to

  #define GEOMETRY_WINDOW_POS_STRING         " (%-4d, %-4d) "

It would be no problem to make that string configurable.  However,
there would be a wide range of possible misuse since this string
is directly passed to sprintf().

  Your "master" file is ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc

  It can contain multiple "Read" commands, which will read in
instructions from other files.  To get a menu to pop up, you have to
bind it to keyboard or mouse action.  Before you do, here's the most
common booby-trap in FVWM.  Make sure that the statement...

IgnoreModifiers L25

  is executed somwhere by fvwm.  This prevents shift/capslock/scrollock
from interfering.  I set {ALT-F10} to pop up "Mymenu"

Key F10 AT M Menu MyMenu Nop

  Oh yeah, we really should define "MyMenu".  The syntax for adding
programs is...

+ "visible label" Exec exec program-name

  You don't have to use the full path if PATH is set up properly, but I
was a bit pedantic when I was setting up.  Here's my main menu.  Use it
as a working example.  If you don't have one of the listed programs on
your system, it obviously won't run.  Modify to suit your needs.

AddToMenu MyMenu "My Menu" Title
+ "Root Menu"     Popup MenuFvwmRoot
+ "FVWM manuals"  Popup FvwmManPage
+ ""              Nop
+ "Citrix config" Exec exec /usr/lib/ICAClient/wfcmgr

  OK, so I'm lazy.  I let the computer do all the hard work<g>.  Besides
it occasionally *IS* nice to be able to type away in a fullscreen
document while keeping another window floating on top.  This beats the
daylights out of {ALT-TAB}'ing back and forth during multiple cut/paste
operations.  Or you may want a TV program running in it

  Hmmmm, maybe there is a use for those idiot keys that Bill Gates has
dumped on the spacebar.

Hm, disappointing. Not "try CVS now" or "here's some pointers on how to
implement it"?-)

I thought FakeClick might be a solution, but I can't seem to get it to
work. What I tried is this:

Mouse 1 W       N       Current [ !Raised ] AnssiRaiseOrNop

DestroyFunc AnssiRaiseOrNop
AddToFunc AnssiRaiseOrNop
+ M FakeClick depth 3 press 1
+ C Raise

I tried depth 2 also, but no change.

Yes, of course. If I try 'find ./ "needed_icon"' it will find it.

The whole configuration is OK except this point.

I use /root/.fvwm2rc when I am root and this works OK.

I copied the same file into /home/vaclavp/.fvwm2rc and fvwm has the same 
look as I expected. But it wants icons only in /usr/share/icons however 
I specified another path.

Just out of curiosity, what is 
#define GEOMETRY_WINDOW_STRING             " +8888 x +8888 "
used for, is it to compute the width of the feedback windows. Since this
is the most wide string that could appear?

hi,
    sorry  for disturbing again .

    Now i got all settings how i want .
    Iam using " nedit" as text editer everywhere. But after i started
using this new fvwm2.4.4 the size of this nedit is not fixed . For some
file which have more memory like  700k the size ( geometry) is very big
. But it is maintaing the height & only the width is increasing .It is
crossing window size also. why it is like that.

my default geometry for nedit is 80X40.


This is not only my problem . here whoever using this , they are also
facing this.
pls give the solution.

thanx & rgds

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now i got all settings how i want .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iam using " nedit" as text editer everywhere. But
after i started using this new fvwm2.4.4 the size of this nedit is not
fixed . For some file which have more memory like&nbsp; 700k the size (
geometry) is very big . But it is maintaing the height &amp; only the width
is increasing .It is crossing window size also. why it is like that.
<p>my default geometry for nedit is 80X40.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is not only my problem . here whoever using this , they are also
facing this.

[Can you please keep your answer after the question, i.e. quotes first]

I think RedHat has /usr/share/icons path built into fvwm2, so it is always
searched (last).

Now, it should be PixmapPath not IconPath for most of the icon needs.
But please don't use these obsolete commands, use ImagePath instead,
it is the only currently supported way, and it was backported to 2.2.3.

Other than this, you should solve this on your system. I would recheck
that you have read permissions for files in /usr/local/my_icons again.
You may also specify a full icon path just to see that it is not the
problem:

  Style * Icon /usr/local/my_icons/unknown.xpm

Regards,
Mikhael.

  Let's see if I understand this.  The directive...

> *FvwmButtons: (2x3, Frame 0, Swallow(UseOld,NoHints) "Inline" "Module FvwmPager Inline 0 0")                                                               

  Starts up an instance of Fvwmpager, using alias name "Inline", and
then swallows it.  So the following lines...

> DestroyModuleConfig Inline: *
> *Inline: Balloons
> *Inline: Font none
> *Inline: Rows 1
> *Inline: Columns 1

 ...are actually referring to that instance of FvwmPager.  Sounds logical.
Thanks for the explanation.  The linkage wasn't obvious to me, which is
why I asked that question.  Your answer got me to search for the word
"alias" in the fvwm2 man page, which gave the necessary details.

It's a very difficult thing to do.  One one hand, fvwm needs to
process the pointer events to decide if the click was meant for
the application or for fvwm.  But when it receives the first
motion exent, the X server has already forgotten about the initial
click and the application will never get it.  This works fine with
rxvt, but xterm and xemacs need the click to mark a region.  Also,
since the click is lost for the application, a simple click is no
longer handled by the application, i.e. if you click on a button
or menu in the application it is raised, but the click does not
work on the button or menu.

[hours later]

Success! :-D

I found a way to implement this.  Try 

  Style * MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotion

I don't recommend to use this feature in conjunction with mouse
bindings on the client part of the windows ('W' context).  This
will probably fail utterly.

I have just implemented "enter_window" and "raise_window" events
in FvwmEvent.  With a few lines in your configuration file you can
now get what you want.

  AddToFunc EnterEvent
  + I WindowId $0 (!raised) Raise
  *FvwmEvent: PassId
  *FvwmEvent: enter_window "Silent EnterEvent"

And if fvwm is not yet started:

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent

It may be possible that enter and leave events are sometimes not
sent as they should be.  If you can pin down such a situation,
please report back.  You'll need tomorrow's snapshot, or 2.5.0,
but I can't promise when this will be released.

Bye

I've got some troubles with menu style.
Can I make that menus are poped down only on a keypress, not on mouse motion?

When I move mouse cursor through the menu and the cursor is on triangle, a submenu pops up. I  want to popup submenus only on a mouse click. But they are popped up also on mouse move to the triangle.
Can I do that?

I don't think you may currently change this behaviour, 25% of a menu item
at the right near the triangle is always "popup immediately or after
popdown delay if another submenu is up".

If you absolutely want it to be activated only on mouse click or key, you
may use Menu keyword instead of Popup. But there are "side" effects, no
triangle, your parent menu is closed and (by default) position is under
cursor. Maybe this is what you prefer anyway?

Regards,
Mikhael.

No, not with the version you have right now, but yes, if you
download tomorrow's snapshot and use the new menu style I just
wrote:

  MenuStyle * PopupDelayed, PopupDelay 0, PopupActiveArea 100

At work, running 2.4.0 on a Sun Solaris box, I have in my .fvwm2rc

Key Tab A M -

which successfully turns off the built in menu.  It's difficult to use
XEmacs when the WM intercepts M-Tab :-)

Last night I (finally!) upgraded fvwm at home to 2.4.3.  I use the
same .fvwm2rc file (FvwmM4 is a big help here) but the above line
appears to have no effect.  However, it does the right thing if I
input that into an FvwmConsole.  Should I downgrade to 2.4.0 at home?
Is there some linux issue I'm not taking into account?  I run RH6.2
with kdm turned on for login purposes.  I have no problem turning it
off if that would help.

Thanks,

Hi,

Apologies for a silly question from a new user.
I get a message:
[FVWM][CatchRedirectError]: <<ERROR>> another WM is running

What is being checked to arrive to this conclusion?
How does fvwm2 figure it out?I'd be really greatful if
somebody explained the mechanism behind this message to me.
I tried to search archives and fvwm Web pages, but no luck....

Thanks a lot,

Iwona

If I attempt to  answer your  question,  will you promise not  to send
vcards to our list?

Heres the code:

events.h:
#define XEVMASK_ROOTW   (LeaveWindowMask| EnterWindowMask | \
          PropertyChangeMask | SubstructureRedirectMask | KeyPressMask | \
          SubstructureNotifyMask | ColormapChangeMask | \
          STROKE_CODE(ButtonMotionMask | DEFAULT_ALL_BUTTONS_MOTION_MASK |) \
          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask)

fvwm.c:
  XSetErrorHandler(CatchRedirectError);
  XSetIOErrorHandler(CatchFatal);
  XSelectInput(dpy, Scr.Root, XEVMASK_ROOTW);
  XSync(dpy, 0);

The XSelectInput attempted to  get the X server  to redirect events on
the root window to fvwm.  Its failing and  CatchRedirectError is 
issuing the message because
some  other  program  has already  done  that.   Normally  only window
managers get root window events.

You should rather upgrade to 2.4.4.  2.4.3 and below had some
rather unpleasant side effects with key bindings that have been
fixed in 2.4.4.

No, this is purely an fvwm issue.

Hi,

	I am facing a problem when running a X-application using 2 different window
managers
	MWM and FVWM.

	Following is the scenario:

	I start an MAIN X-application. Through one of the menu options in the main
window,
	I call a window(say parent). This parent window also has a few other menu
options.
	When one of these menu options are clicked, another window (say child)is
displayed.

	In case of MWM,
	When I exit out of the parent window without exiting out of the child, the
child window
	dissappears and so does the parent. Now if I start the parent window again
and try to
	invoke the child window	it does not appear. The child window will no longer
appear unless
	the entire MAIN application is restarted and we get back using the same
procedure
	(call parent then child).

	In case of FVWM,
	When I exit out of the parent window without exiting out of the child, the
child window
	remains on the screen without disappearing, but the parent window
disappears(as expected).
	Now if I start the parent window again and try to invoke the child window,
it re-appears.

	Hence, for the same instance of MAIN application, the child window once it
disappears,
	will no longer appear in case of MWM, but it appears every time I invoke,
in case of FVWM.
	As per me, the behaviour of the child window in case of FVWM is correct and
as expected.

	I wanted to know why the change in behaviour and what needs to be done so
that the
	behaviour is same when I run my code on both the window managers.

	If anyone has an idea on this, please let me know your
comments/suggestions.
Thanks & Regards,
Mala.

Check the fvwm2 man page for what it says about transients.
There are lots of options plus a section that describes how to
make fvwm work like mwm.

Hello guys,

I am working on a configuration tool for FVWM (and similar WMs). Its called fvwmrcedit 
and is hosted at SourceForge.net (fvwmrcedit.sourceforge.net). It writes and edits fvwmrc 
files and is written using the Xt toolkit and the Athena widget set. I have covered basic 
options to some extent and am now working on editing menus (that part is not complete). 
Hope you guys will have a look at it and try it out. Thanks in advance.

Bye.

The best thing about email is that you all can't see me blushing right
now.  I should have checked the web page for a newer version first.

Hello, I've been having a bit of difficulty with an fvwm 'keyboard
accelerator'. My problem is that when I press <Alt-F1> to bring up the
WindowList, it goes away as soon as I release <Alt>, and before I've had a
chance to key in my selection. This behavior only effects the left <Alt>
button. The right <Alt> button performs correctly, as does bringing up
WindowList with mouse button 3. Oddly both <Alt> buttons function
correctly when using accelerators defined for <F2>, <F3> etc. I'm
connecting to a remote Xserver (XwinPro5.3) running on windows98 if that's
relevant.

The problem began after I installed SGL (niche linux distro) which builds
fvwm from the latest sources (2.4.4), and I tried using my same config
file that I've been using with older versions (I was previously using
2.2.4 with RH linux).

I'm defining this behavior in my .fvwm2rc file:

# Keyboard accelerators
Key F3          A       M       Popup "Utilities"
Key F2          A       M       Menu "Window Ops"
Key F1          A       M       WindowList

# Button    Context Modifi  Function
Mouse 3         R       A       WindowList

It's not a critical issue, but it's kind of a pain forcing myself to use
the right alt button when I'm use to the left :-)

Ideas anyone?

To disable the ALT-auto-selects-on-release behavior, use:

  Key F1          A       M       WindowList SelectOnRelease

Hello,

I am running fvwm2 version 2.4.4 and find that the window placement
algorithm is overriding the position which the Java application I am
running is specifying. Is it possible to configure fvwm2 so that
position specified by applications is honored when specified?

Thanks,

Neil

  Style my-java-app UsePPosition

Also try UseUSPosition if this does not work. There are several related
style options documented in the man page, and even more in the pre-2.5.0.

Hi
We have a server with fvwm 2.4.3 and we are
experiencing the following problems:
1. Sometimes the menus and keybindings in fvwm stop
working. The only solution is to kill X (CTRL + ALT +
Backspace) and restart X (4.1.0).
2. Sometimes we cannot write text in any application
until we kill Netscape. It seems like Netscape is
keeping focus (Style is FocusFollowMouse) and the WM
(fvwm) refuses to switch (keyboard) focus to the
window
where the mouse pointer is in (example: an xterm 
window)
If you want i can send the config files.
System is:
Slackware 8.0, Kernel 2.4.16, X 4.1.0 (compiled from
source) , Fvwm 2.4.3 (compiled from source), gcc
2.95.3
CFLAGS='-O2 '
Thanks 
Bye

I was reading the FAQ before posting the NumLock 
CapsLock or ScrollLock are _not_ pressed.
What's happening is that the menu from .fvwm2rc in no
 longer  prezent when we press the left mouse button 
in the root window but instead the builtin menu is
there which is quite strange.

Do you have a key, mouse, or menu that would cause Fvwm
to be restarted without reading the users .fvwm2rc?

# ForeGround sets the foreground color of non-selected menu-items
# 
# Popupoffset sets the offset of child-menus.  
#   Format: Popupoffset pixels percent
#	We set the percent to 100, making the child-menus pop-up to the right
#	of the existing menus.
#
# MenuFace sets the background of the menu using the 'fancy' options.
# 	Menuface is another complicated one so again, check the man-page,
#	but I'll explain the one here:
#	This menuface command sets the background of the menus to a 
#	   Horizontal gradient using 64 colors, with one pair of colors,
#	   from the color #758591 to the color #102030.
#	
# Animation turns menu animations on.  If you pop-up a submenu on the right
# 	edge of the screen, the menu will move over so it is fully visible.

# Set up some desktop options
# 
# Desktop [Horizontal]x[vertical]  Defines the virtual desktop size, 
#	1x1 = one physical screen size (no virtual desktop
DesktopSize	3x3

# EdgeResistance scrolling moving
#   Sets how hard it is to change the desktop viewport
#   scrolling is in milliseconds 
#   moving is in pixels (how far a window's edge must move to move off-screen
#
# These values don't much matter in this configuration as our viewport
# is only as big as our screen anyway.
EdgeResistance	500 75

# EdgeScroll horizontal vertical
#   Sets the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor is on the edge
#   of the screen.   Again, not useful in this configuration since we only
#   have a viewport as big as our screen.
EdgeScroll	100 100

# OpaqueMoveSize percentage
#   This option tells fvwm the maximum size window that it should move
#   with contents intact (ie, not 'rubber-banding')  You should keep this
#   low if you don't have good video hardware.
OpaqueMoveSize 50



# Style related options
#
# Styles are used to set-up how windows are treated by the window manager.
# They allow you to change the way windows are placed, decorated and treated
# in general.  You can give different options to different windows, so that
# your xterms may be decorated differently than, say, your netscape window.
# 
# The format of the style commands are:
# 	Style windowname options
#
# The windowname is the window's name class or resource string that you want
# this option to affect.  You can use wildcards (such as * or ?), thus 
# "*" specifies options for all windows.
# The options that you can specify with the Style command are many and varied
# and really warrant a look at the fvwm2 man page.
#
#  We set up some global defaults here for all windows.
Style "*" ForeColor black
Style "*" BackColor #888888
#Style "*" SmartPlacement
Style "*" MinOverlapPlacement

# Key bindings
#   
#  Now we set-up some hot-keys.  
#  The format for Key-bindings is:
#
#  Key keyname context modifier function
#
#  context describes where the binding applies, W for an application window,
#     R for root window, A for anywhere, T for title, etc.
#  modifier is keyboard meta-keys which should be pressed, N for none,
#     S for Shift, M for Meta, C for Control, or A for any. You can combine
#     these, so things like SM (shift-Meta) are valid.
#
Key w W M Iconify 
Key w I M Iconify 
Key F4 W M Close 
Key F11 A C Exec exec xlock -mode matrix &
Key F9 A M Desk 0 0
Key F10 A M Desk 0 1
Key F11 A M Desk 0 2
Key F12 A M Desk 0 3

# These are some neat ones.  They allow you to hit control-<Arrow-key>
# to switch focus to the window next to your current window in that direction.
# Some people don't like this, if you don't, comment out these lines
#
Key Right A C Direction East (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Focus
Key Left A C Direction West (CurrentDesk !Iconic) Focus

If you hit this key by accident, does FVWM quit, or
do you have something in your .xinitrc to restart fvwm?
(possibly incorrectly)

The menu name is missing from this command.
I don't see how it could cause a problem.

> +              "Quit" Quit

Sorry, so far, I don't have any other ideas.
I'm sure someone else will though.

Hi Neil,

I have been having some discussions about this lately with fvwm 
support and I think there are still some unresolved problems 
with fvwm window placement.

First, there may be a problem with XFree86. Try running your application
in twm and/or mwm which come with XFree86 and see if you still have the
problem. If so, then it probably is a problem with XFree86, and I don't
think you will get much help from the fvwm group.

Second, try this group again showing that it works in the other 
window managers and not here.

I think you will not benefit from playing with the resources mentioned
in the other email 

  Style my-java-app UsePPosition
                    UseUSPosition

These are style options for placement where the app does not specify
placement.

I have a specific problem with placement also. If I create a popup
window like this:

        ac = 0;
        XtSetArg( al[ac], XmNautoUnmanage, FALSE);             	ac++;
        XtSetArg( al[ac], XmNresizePolicy, XmRESIZE_NONE );    	ac++;
        wid_dialog_login
	 = XmCreateBulletinBoardDialog( TheTopShell, "loginpopup", al, ac );

And then use the .Xdefaults for placement:

	mtest1*loginpopup.x:					442
	mtest1*loginpopup.y:					94
	mtest1*loginpopup.width:				500
	mtest1*loginpopup.height:				320
	
	mtest1*loginpopup*lbl_caption.x:			0
	mtest1*loginpopup*lbl_caption.y:			10
	mtest1*loginpopup*lbl_caption.width:			480
	mtest1*loginpopup*lbl_caption.labelString:		LOGIN SCREEN

Then the loginpopup.x and .y will be totally ignored even though
for example the loginpopup*lbl_caption.x will be honored: this is
the same in twm and mwm, and probably is a bug in XFree86.

If I add

	mtest1*loginpopup.geometry: 500x320+442+94

Then the geometry specification 500x320 is honored in twm
and mwm, but not in fvwm and I think probably is a bug in fvwm.

Could the problems in your Java application be connected to this?

Yup, upgrading to 2.4.4 solved the problem.  Now to get my sysadmin to
upgrade at work.  Good thing he works for me :-)

Hi!

I've decided to take some time to costumize my favorite windomanager so it
becomes even cooler, but i have run into a problem i can't fix...

I would like to add a sticky button that appears to be pressed down when
pressed the first time, and when pressed again it switches back to look as
it did before it was pressed, and the window will no longer be stuck.

I have been trying with statements similar to these:

AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveUpToggled  2 70x15@0 30x55@1 
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveDownToggled 2 70x15@1 30x55@0

Or just

AddButtonStyle 3 Toggled  2 70x15@0 30x55@1
AddButtonStyle 3 Toggled 2 70x15@1 30x55@0

I have tried a couple of variations using the word "Toggled" , but i
can not get it to work. I'm guessing that this is approach is wrong?

Does anyone have a suggestion to how i can accomplish this?

You obviously did not try all the combinations. :-)
Actually, guessing is not needed here if you know the keyword:

  % man fvwm2
  /Toggled

It is "ToggledActiveUp" etc. But the approach is not quite right.
Your vector drawing is also not good, you can't do it with only 2 lines.
Try this:

  Style "*" MWMButtons  # button relief follows the state
  Mouse 0 3 N Stick
  ButtonStyle 3 - Clear MWMDecorStick
  ButtonStyle 3 Inactive          Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
  ButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp          Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
  ButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown        Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledInactive   Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp   Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1
  ButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1

You see that it is the same vector drawing, because sunk/raised is
automatically reversed in toggled states, so you may make it shorter:

  Style "*" MWMButtons  # button relief follows the state
  Mouse 0 3 N Stick
  ButtonStyle 3 - Clear MWMDecorStick
  ButtonStyle 3 Vector 4 75x25@0 75x75@0 25x75@0 75x25@1

(You may omit the "Vector" word everywhere.)

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello,

I have recently switched to FVWM2, and am a fan so far.  I like the
ability to configure practically everything.

I often run an X-session over VNC (server and client both run on Linux
machines), and would like for FVWM to ignore all of my key/mouse
events when the mouse is over (or focus is on) the VNC client's
window.  IOW, I want FVWM to pass those events on to the window,
usually because I want the FVWM running over VNC to receive them.

Is there any way to accomplish this?  I looked in the manpage, and saw
the mention of this in the section on ICCCM compliance--it looked like

sure before I gave up.

Thanks, and please be sure to CC me, as I'm not a member of the list.

P.S.
I tried searching the list archives, but every search I performed

I would still suggest that your keybindings stop working when one of the
modifiers returned by `xmodmap` on your system are pressed.

> Mouse 2 R N Menu "Window-Popup" Nop 
> Mouse 3 R N Module FvwmWinList transient

So, if some unknown modifier is pressed, "N" does not work. Use "A" - any.

  Mouse 1 R A Menu "Utilities" Nop
  Mouse 2 R A Menu "Window-Popup" Nop
  Mouse 3 R A Module FvwmWinList transient

Regards,
Mikhael.

There are no silly question, only silly answers.  The fact that
people have trouble finding the necessary information indicates
that our documentation isn't good enough.

Yes, but not easily.  Most bindings are somewhere in your
.fvwm2rc, e.g.

  mouse 1 t n move
  key f1 a m foobar
  ...

and some are found in the ConfigFvwmDefaults file that comes with
fvwm.

If you put all of them in one fvwm function and the commands to
disable them in another, you can switch the bindings on an off
when the pointer enters the VNC window with FvwmAuto or
FvwmEvent.  It's a bit difficult to get this right.  You don't
want to re-add the bindings every time the focus changes because
it costs a lot of time.  This is what I finally came up with:

--------------------------- snip --------------------------
DestroyFunc activate_bindings
DestroyFunc remove_bindings
DestroyFunc do_activate_bindings
DestroyFunc do_remove_bindings

AddToFunc AddAllBindings
+ I Mouse 1 T A Function MoveOrRaise

AddToFunc RemoveAllBindings
+ I Mouse 1 T A beep

AddToFunc activate_bindings
+ I Function do_activate_bindings
+ I DestroyFunc do_activate_bindings
+ I DestroyFunc do_remove_bindings
+ I AddToFunc do_remove_bindings I Function RemoveAllBindings

AddToFunc remove_bindings
+ I Function do_remove_bindings
+ I DestroyFunc do_activate_bindings
+ I DestroyFunc do_activate_bindings
+ I AddToFunc do_activate_bindings I Function AddAllBindings

AddTofunc focus_change_event
+ I WindowId $0 (FvwmConsole) Function remove_bindings
+ I WindowId $0 (!FvwmConsole) Function activate_bindings

AddToFunc do_remove_bindings
+ I Function RemoveAllBindings

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I AddAllBindings
+ I Module FvwmEvent

AddToFunc EnterEvent
+ I WindowId $0 (!raised) Raise
*FvwmEvent: PassId
*FvwmEvent: focus_change "Silent focus_change_event"

Style FvwmConsole MouseFocus, MouseFocusClickRaisesOff
--------------------------- snip --------------------------

This example works with FvwmConsole.  You'll have to replace that
with the VNC window's unique name or resource.  I think this works
best with MouseFocus, so I set this explicitly at the end.  The
AddAllBindings and RemoveAllBindings should contain all key
bindings and all mouse bindings that work on the client window.
You can leave mouse bindings on the title, buttons, border or the
root window activated all the time.

Unfortunately that does not work with any released version.  I
discovered a bug that caused infinite focus_change events while
the pointer was over the FvwmConsole window.  You can either
download tomorrow's snapshot or wait for the 2.5.0 release.

I think that is a bug in netscape, at least in the newer versions.
With netscape 4.x I never had such problems, but with netscape 6
or mozilla, netscape sometimes freezes the keyboard, the pointer
or even the whole X server while waiting for a connection.

We are definitely interested in such a tool.  I didn't have time
to look at it yet, but I'll do so as soon as I can.  It would be
a good idea to join the fvwm-workers mailing and to discuss the
overall design and how the tool is intended to be integrated with
fvwm.

With "fvwm support", David means me ;-)  Come to think of it, I
hope I'll again do more development than support in the near
future :-)

If so, this is almost the proof that the problem is *not* in
XFree.

There is no such thing as an "fvwm group".  We are all volunteers
that spend a lot of our spare time on working on fvwm.  You may
think about us what you want, but please keep your opinion in
private mails and don't offend the people who spend many hours
each year to make fvwm better - for nothing but happy users.
Personally, I want to add that I rarely spend so much time with a
single bug report as this one (at least four ours up to now).

Whatever.  Showing that something works in one WM and not for
another proves nothing.  It may still be either WM that is broken
or the application, or the X server, or X11 itself, or the OS,
or ...

In the case of Java applications we already know about some
problems in fvwm that are not present in mwm.  Unfortunately there
are some hacks in mwm to cope with Java apps, but we can't find a
proper spec to do the same in fvwm.

Sorry, you're misunderstanding something.  These options are
intended to be used *when* the application specifies the position,
not vice versa.  UsePPosition tells fvwm to use the application's
idea of the proper position and UseUSPosition tells fvwm to honour
the user's position specification from the X resources.  The only
way a window manager can distinguish between them is by looking at
the us_position field of the window's wm hints.  Since some
applications set this hint although the user did not specify the
position, fvwm can be explicitly told to ignore it and come up
with its own.  By default, both styles are enabled, but many
config files have

  Style * NoPPosition

In this case, the quoted line should indeed help.

I thought we had already discussed this.  The resource strings
"x", "y", "width" and "height" have *no* *special* *meaning* in X.
I repeat to make it perfectly clear: the X server *completely*
*ignores* these settings.

It is the application's responsibility to do something with these
resources.  If you want this done by the x server, please use
"geometry" which works perfectly if used properly (as I have
already shown with your application).  Remove all .x, .y, .width,
.height and .geometry settings from your .Xdefaults file, add the
lines I sent you and restart the X server (if necessary, reboot
your machine) and it *will* work.  Period.

The reason why *some* of the .width / .height settings seem to
work is because the *application* or the X toolkit has implemented
them.  Please refer to the documentation of Xt and any
applications you use to find about which resources exist and which
do not.  To find out the proper Xt resource strings, you can use
the editres program that comes with x.  It also has a nice man
page:

  $ man editres

If you need a book about Xt, try

  O'Reilly, Vol. 5: X Toolkit Intrinsics, Reference Manual

All your questions should be answered in above documentation.

See above, works properly if used properly.

In my enthusiasm for newfound tricks I incorporate
changes to use the trick and then lose what the fvwm
`name` is of a certain behavior (which I want to
change). E.g:

1. I like the disappearing taskbar. But I can only get
one mouse button to work:
Case 1
# Only right btn iconifies none other works
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 RaiseAndFocus
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Iconify On
Case 2
# This way left button iconifies none others work
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 RaiseAndFocus
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 Iconify On
Case 3
# This way left button Raises and Focuses
*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 RaiseAndFocus
#*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close   	#
#*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Iconify On	#

Any clues what I did before this to make that happen?

2. In the last case I left click to raise and focus
somebody, but I cannot get to the window fast enough
because it disappears again. What causes that?

3. What should these do:

Style "*"         IconTitle mini-x2.xpm
Style "*xterm*"   TitleIcon mini-term.xpm

4. Can you AutoHide the MiniButton Bar?

Regards.

Strange.  Can you please post your whole FvwmTaskBar
configuration?  What fvwm version do you have?

> 3. What should these do:
> 
> Style "*"         IconTitle mini-x2.xpm

The IconTitle style turns on displaying the name of the icon below
the picture.  It does accept any additional arguments, though.
This is equivalent to simply

  Style "*" IconTitle

> Style "*xterm*"   TitleIcon mini-term.xpm

Print an error message.  There is no "TitleIcon" style.  To
specify the picture for xterms this line should do:

  Style "xterm" Icon mini-term.xpm

You can find a complete description of all styles in the fvwm2 man

> 4. Can you AutoHide the MiniButton Bar?

No, only the task bar has AutoHide yet and it doesn't work well.
I have this in my config:

  Style FvwmButtons NoTitle, HandleWidth 1, TitleAtBottom

and

  AddToFunc ResizeOrRaise
  + C Raise
  + M Raise
  + M ResizeMaximize
  + D Current (Shaded) Raise
  + D WindowShade toggle
  Mouse 1 FS    N   Function ResizeOrRaise

So I can double click on the border of FvwmButtons to hide it at
the bottom of the screen.  You could also use FvwmEvent to hide
and show the window when the pointer enters or leaves it:

  *FvwmEvent: focus_change "hide_show_buttons"

  AddToFunc StartFunction
  + I Module FvwmEvent

  AddToFunc hide_show_buttons
  + I Current (FvwmButtons) WindowShade off
  + I Current (!FvwmButtons) All (FvwmButtons) WindowShade on

  Style FvwmButtons NoTitle, HandleWidth 1, TitleAtBottom
  Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus

That doesn't work well if you have more than one button bar (you
could solve that problem with module aliases).

All this assumes that you have at least fvwm-2.4.0.

I just committed a patch to the development sources that improves
the situation a bit.  It will be part of the new alpha release
(2.5.0).

  *FvwmEvent: focus_change "hide_show_buttons"

  AddToFunc StartFunction

  AddToFunc hide_show_buttons

  + I PointerWindow (FvwmButtons) WindowShade off
  
  Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus

This still depends on MouseFocus.  It would be nice to be able to
use NeverFocus on FvwmButtons, but it doesn't work well with the
enter_window and leave_window events of FvemEvent.

Bye

thru the entire doc.

Hi
I would like to work around a Netscape behaviour which
is really desgusting.
This is what's happenning:
I surf the net with netscape, have some windows
openned
on various sites and i decide i wanna see some news
and
go to www.google.com (and others). I type the url in 
the location bar, press enter and switch to another
 window. After some time the window with google raises
and take focus automatically. Is there a way to stop 
this ? .
I have focusfollow mouse but i saw the same behaviour 
on windoze so i think in OS independent.
The question is: Is there a way to tell fvwm to ignore
this (eventually to make a Click to focus _only_ for
netscape ? ) ?
Thanks
Bye

  quite a few programs on ms win are this annoying but I haven't noticed
anything like this under linux&fvwm (at least not with netscape).

  it might be something in your configuration (I also use focus follow
mouse). which version of fvwm you use?

there are specific sites at which this problem occur:
groups.google.com, www.hotmail.com
If you have a very fast internet connexion you won't
notice that.
The window is raising when it is loading. You can see
this problem _if you have a slow internet connexion 
and switch to another window when the other page is
loading_.
It seems (it's just a speculation) that netscape
issues
some kind of MapRequest (as described in the FAQ at
Q5.7)

Which netscape version do you have?

You can tell fvwm not to give netscape windows the focus
automatically:

  Style Navigator GrabFocusOff, GrabFocusTransientOff

You also can also start new netscape windows below all other
windows, but this is probably a bit inconvenient:

  Style Navigator StartsLowered

If you know the precise name of the annoying windows you could use
that name in the style to limit it to only these windows:

  Style "*The World's FREE Web-based E-mail*" StartsLowered

Does any of this help?

Hi,
	We have an X-application which has several windows each of which
has buttons to be clicked. The application is written in such a way that
only one button can be selected at a time.

In one of the windows (and sometimes after doing reload of that window), 
among the left pane radio buttons more than one button were seen to be 
pressed (which is wrong).
So, if we want to click one button among that set (which are seen
to be pressed), that option won't be selected. However, if we select any 
other button (which are in unselected state), then this problem goes off.
Everything returns to normalcy.

Only with the XWindow manager (mwm) this problem is seen 
(that too intermittently). This problem does not occur in case of fvwm.
It would be helpful if anyone could let me know their comments on this.
Thanks,
Mala.

Hello,

I strongly appreciate and admire the fvwm window manager and the
many volunteers who have spent a lot of their spare time working
on this product. I never meant to suggest otherwise, and withdraw
any contrary inference in my prior email.

I removed the .fvwm2rc file and after doing so got the behavior
I wanted.

Thanks to everyone and especially Mr. Vogt for their patience.

David

I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

It sounds like your application doesn't work.

Hi

I'm new to the list. I discovered fvwm 2.4 a few days ago, that's a great 
window manager, and it really fits my needs !

Just one problem : accented characters in title bars or icons are not 
properly displayed. Each time an accented character is displayed, I got some 
extra characters before, like : 

"%/1iso8859-15"

I had no problem before with the same fonts and the KDE window manager.

Anyone can help me ?

Thanks

Denis

I see a few problems in your config file, but they don't eplain
everything you said:

> #AddToFunc DeiconifyRaiseAndFocus
> + I Iconify off
> + I Raise
> + I Focus

You can't comment out just the first line.  The commands are added
to the last function you defined, in this case to window_ops_func
which is defined 250 lines above.  But probably you wanted to use
that function below, so use

  AddToFunc RaiseAndFocus
  + I Iconify off
  + I Raise
  + I Focus

instead.

> # Only right btn iconifies none other works
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 RaiseAndFocus
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Iconify On

You don't have a "RaiseAndFocus" function in your config file.
All you get is an error message on the console when you try to
call it.  It looks as if you renamed the RaiseAndFocus function to
DeiconifyRaiseAndFocus some time but forgot to.  I can't explain
why button 2 does not work for you.  Does it work anywhere else,
e.g. to paste text that was marked with button 1 in an xterm?
Sometimes, applications can't be closed with "Close", but this
should happen rarely.  "Destroy" always works, but kills the
application without giving it a chance to save its data.

> # This way left button iconifies none others work
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 RaiseAndFocus
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 Iconify On

Just what I'd expect 

> # This way left button Raises and Focuses
> *FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 RaiseAndFocus
> #*FvwmTaskBarAction Click2 Close        #
> #*FvwmTaskBarAction Click3 Iconify On   #

Yes. You only have bound the undefined function, so the default
bindings are used.  The deafult action on the left button is to
raise, deiconify and focus the window.  Since button 2 does not
even work with the default binding I believe the mouse is not
configured properly.  If you run

  $ xev

and click with the middle button in its window you should get
output similar to this:

  ButtonPress event, serial 27, synthetic NO, window 0xe00001,
      root 0x57, subw 0x0, time 2861645936, (138,72), root:(888,94),
      state 0x0, button 2, same_screen YES

  ButtonRelease event, serial 27, synthetic NO, window 0xe00001,
      root 0x57, subw 0x0, time 2861646018, (138,72), root:(888,94),
      state 0x200, button 2, same_screen YES

If not, the button is definitely not configured right (or simply
broken).

Yes, at present time you should compile fvwm your self and
pass the "--enable-multibyte" option to ./configure.
I hope that this will not be needed for the next stable
release: 2.4.6 (as fvwm is not fully tested with this
option).

Hm.  How would you structure this summary?  Just the command name
and a brief description?

I ran into the solution by chance by changing the
clicks to:

*FvwmTaskBarAction Click1 Iconify -1,Raise,Focus

I suppose that does the same thing as calling the
Function?

You learn something neat every day. Today was at least
this xev that I had never heard of. (The other was
that lilo 22.1 has neater menus...)

This is a new Debian system that I installed 2 days
ago. I had forgotten to change F86Config to set 3
button emulation: I have a 2 button PS/2 mouse...
So now everything works... Button 1 does RaiseAndFocus
without calling the Funcion. Button 2 Iconifies and
Button 3 Closes.

Thanks Dominik. Good job.

Regards. Hugo.

This is what the FvwmTaskBar man page has to
say about it:

Warning: Use of the  former  syntax
that  allowed  to use comma separated lists of com=AD
mands is strongly discouraged due  to  synchroniza=AD
tion  problems  with fvwm.  Please use complex fvwm
functions instead (defined with the AddToFunc  com=AD
mand of fvwm).

I think a command summary in the man page would be not that helpful. The
problem is that the fvwm2 man page is just too big and the requirements
to the man page are too various. Sometimes one is looking for a special
command, an other time one looks for some certain behavior and next time
one is browsing through the man page just to get a new idea, without
actually knowing what to look for ;-)
Regarding this, one needs three (or even more) man pages for one
application or one really big man page containing a lot of redundancy.
And even then some people might not find what they are looking for.

Maybe a set of html-files could provide a more comfortable way the get
the required information. I like the html documentation for java
provided by the javadoc program. (javadoc produces a set of html pages.
I think actually there three frames one for chapters (java packages),
one for sections (class names) and for the text.) Maybe you guys could
do a similar documentation for fvwm2. 

Another way could be providing a setup/configuration tool which comes
with fvwm2. A tool which interacts with fvwm2 would provide much more
help as a good documentation can do. (But it cannot replace the doc.) I
know there are some people working on a config tool, but none of the
tools is supported by fvwm2 and none, which really works, does interact
with fvwm2.

Actually, I recently thought about doing the documentation in SGML
like the Linux Documentation Project does.  Other that this, I
have no knowledge about SGML at all.

I just had a look in the web about SGML and the LDP. It seems that it
might be not that complicated to translate the fvwm2 man pages to
DocBook SGML or DocBook XML, which are the languages used in the LDP. 
The LDP provides a documentation for authors at
http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html 
(There was also a good article in the german computer magazine c't
02/2002 about XML.)

	Of course, it would :-)
	First, a list of "grand concepts" : layers, styles, frames,
desktop, pages... with minimal explanations.
	Second a list of functionnalities : style commands, functions,
menus commands, generic commands, mouse functionnalities, keybord
functionalities, and so on, with very short descriptions, or even
nothing at all.
	Third, and last, the exhaustive list of reserved words, without
any explanation.

	The important thing is that the words apearing in those lists
must match exactly the paragraphes titles and the later references
to the paragraphes titles made in the whole text. So, you can do
searches in manpage pagers, get new ideas by reading the keywords
(which are very significant in fvwm) and get rapidly through the
main principles of the soft. Without having to browse trough a large
set of html files where you can't do global searches easily :-)

	Fab.

I think fvwm2 has a very nice manual page. Very
 few programs have such good written manual pages.

A very good source of information is also New-features

fvwm configuration file. Other configs are also a good

source of information.

I did not say that I think the man page is not good nor something
similar. The problem was that sometimes it can be difficult to find the
required information in the page. But this does not mean that the man
page is not good enough. In fact I think the fvwm2 man page is one of
the best man pages I have ever seen. However, maybe you go with me
saying that finding something in a large document is most times more
difficult that finding something in a small document. 
Since the fvwm2 man page is quite big it might sometimes a problem
finding the required information in the time one expected. This was
actually the aim of my saying.

Maybe generating a html page will be helpfull.
There is a program man2html but it generates
references 
at the end of the file not at the beginning.

Maybe the developers will consider generating a html
version from the manual page.

I'm running a virtual desktop with 9 screens. I have edge scrolling
completely turned off, and the cursor still moves off the 'east' side of
my screen. No scroling occurs, but the cursor disapears and the window
that has focus loses it until the cursor enters the screen again.  It
appears to only happen off the 'east' (right) side of my screen.  When
the cursor hits the top, bottom, or left side it stops and doesn't leave
the screen.
Is this a bug or am I missing something?

Thanks,

What release are you using?

Which X server are you using?

What commands did you use to turn off scrolling?

Did you do:

EdgeThickness 0

I would look at HyperLatex too. Problem now is finding
something in the documentation, which is large. It
begs for an index. Actually the program itself is a
perfect candidate for an expert system`s approach.

That's was what I was aiming at when I suggested using SGML.  From
the SGML source you can generate the documentation in virtually
any other format, including html, info and man page.

Sorry for being missunderstood. The ideea was using 
html because it permits links in document and 
 easy navigation.(_if it's well done_). It's very 
easy to generate a html page from fvwm manual but it's
useless as long as it has ~250k and it doesn't have
a link to every command inside the page. I just
generated a fvwm2 documentation in html (using 
man2html) but the index is at the end of the page 
and is pretty weak (you cannot access individual 
configuration commands from it). 
Not the format is the problem but the speed of finding

the information you want (if it's one big html without
an index or links to fvwm configuration commands it's
like reading the manual page, only the viewer is
different).
I hope you underestand what i mean and i think uwe 
wanted something like this.

Sorry for bothering you. 
I don't mind reading the manual page but at some time 
in the future it could became a huge man page and 
serching through it will became something painfull.

There are a slew of converters available. E.g man2html
allows you to put your systems man pages all in a
browser format with cgi-bin. rman does it individually
but from man to anything. I just tried fvwm -> latex
and html. Does a decent job given the weird characters
that are used. But I still like HyperLatex because it
doesnt just do an automated conversion.

  One thing I'd like to see is maybe an appendix with nothing but style
settings.  Maybe group by menu styles, window styles, etc.  The problem
right now is that I have to hunt all over the place.  Menu styles are
part of menu docs, window styles are part of Window doc, etc.

In my config file I have the following:

Mouse 0 2       N       Maximize-Func
Mouse 0 2       C       Maximize 100 0
Mouse 0 2       S       Maximize 75 75
Mouse 0 2       M       Maximize 0 100

This worked perfectly in earlier versions of FVWM-2, giving me
different maximizations for different modifiers.  However, on all
editions of FVWM 2.4, this fails completely.  The only way to get
my maximize button to work is to use

Mouse 0 2       A       Maximize-Func

I recently upgraded from 2.4.3 to 2.4.4 in the hope that that would
fix it - without luck.

Is this a known bug, or have I failed to read the upgrade notes
properly at some stage?  How can I get it working again?

Brian.

Probably one of the locking modifiers is pressed (num-lock,
caps-lock, scroll-lock, etc.).  I don't see how this could be
caused by upgrading to 2.4.x.  Did your X setup change?

we have been testing out SunBlade100 and encountering a keyboard
malfunction.

keyboard functions normally when machine is logged-in with CDE or at the
login screen.
on the contrary, when logged in using fvwm some keys do not function
properly
(ie "a","q","space-bar" etc.. keys appear as "^[" )
We tried several login attempts, including using root to log-in from the
console.

could you shed some lights on this issue please?

thanks,
Daisuke

hi,

    I switched my WM from 2.0 to 2.4.4.
    Now every thing working fine & i got the settings how I want. But
Iam facing problem with nedit.

    Iam working in Unix & using solaris system (sun7).

    Iam using " nedit" as text editer everywhere. But after i started
using  new fvwm2.4.4 the size of this nedit is not fixed . For some file
which have more memory like  700k the size ( geometry) is very big . But
it is maintaing
the height & only the width is increasing (may be arround some 5 time of
screen width) .
It is crossing window size also.

why it is like that. ?  How can i correct this?
This problem was not there in fvwm 2.0

my default geometry for nedit is 80X40.

This is not only my problem . here whoever using 2.4.4  they are also
facing this.
pls give the solution .

thanx & rgds
srivathsa

CDE may be modifying the tty settings of terminal windows or the
keyboard layout of the X server.  If you compare the output of

  $ stty -a 

from fvwm and CDE, are there any differences?  Likewise, is the
output of

  $ xmodmap -pk

identical?

You could also try running fvwm under CDE.  You can find the
instructions to set this up in question 2.2 in the fvwm FAQ.

We've heard this report once already but could not reproduce the
problem.  Please provide the following information.

 1) Which nedit version do you have?
 2) Did you upgrade nedit at the same time as fvwm?
 3) Can you give me an example data file along with the .nedit
    file from your home directory?  Please send these files not to
    the mailing list but directly to me - and make sure to
    compress teh data file aggressively, ("bzip2 -9" if possible,
    or "gzip --best").

Regardless of these questions, you can try to force nedit to
behave with several styles:

  Style nedit MaxWindowSize 100 100

limits nedit windows to the actual screen size.  Or if that
does not suit your needs you could try

  Style nedit MaxWindowSize 753p 100

753 pixels is the default width of the nedit window for me.  It
may be different on your system, depending on font size and the
width of the window borders.  To find out the precise value, use
"xwininfo" on the nedit window, add twice the size of the border
to the number after "Width:" and use that instead.

If using an alpha release is an option for you, you can also try
out the 2.5.0 release (actually, it's much more stable than the
term "alpha" suggests, but there are no guarantees).  Using one of
the styles

  Style nedit FixedPSize

or

  Style nedit FixedUSSize

may help.  Note that you won't be able to resize the window
manually if you use the second one.

Bye

If I do not use the ClickToFocus style (the Unix
approach) then RaiseLower raises the next window as it
should. If that is a small window that sits on top of
a larger one, then as soon as I move the mouse over
the larger one, the smaller window that was raised
will disappear again because of the `Unix approach`,
i.e. the lack of ClickToFocus. Is there a solution to
that without reverting to ClickToFocus?

Hi
You can use the FvwmAuto module to perform this task
and specify a delay after it will raise the window
example:

After the initialization section of your .fvwm2rc
you use :
+              "Immediate" Module FvwmAuto 750


And if it a window you want to keep on top of others 
you can use
Style "your_window_name" AlwaysOnTop

Hope it helps
Bye
Calin

Hi,

	I am running fvwm on top of a debian linux. I apt-get installed fvwm but it 
didn't give me all I expected. After a day of checking man and mailing-list I 
dowloaded the V2.4.5 from the fvwm site, compiled and installed it. 
Now I spent my day configuring it and there are still things to Fix. Maybe 
you have clues for me:

	1. the version (V 2.2.5) apt-get installed by debian dynamically created 
menus. I mean, if I installed an application, after restarting fvwm I could 
see the new application in my popup menus.
I have a little Idea of the way it achieved that, but I could not make it 
work on my 2.4.5...
I saw something with Fvwm-menu-desktop, but it adresses only menus dealing 
with gnome or kde... I'd like it to work more generaly with Debian. It seems 
debian places every interisting information in /usr/lib/menu. Someone knows 
how to do ?

	2. I still have problems with my windows
		A. When ALT-TABing, sometimes the focus passes to a window which is on an 
other page. It seems it happens for big windows that spread on theire entire 
pages (mozilla browser) and may have a few pixels an the other page...
		B. I could not set the ALT-TAB behavior the way I expected: I'd like to 
ALT-TAB between the last accessed windows but can just ALT-TAB in circle... 
(I tried FlipFocus but that didn't work)

Any help appreciated...
		--Ben

PS: I dont send you the .fvwm2rc, I took the sample-2 and it is quite 
untouched.

This might help. In nedit 5.0 (and prior) geometries were expressed in pixels.
In nedit 5.1, geometries are expressed as columns and rows!!!! You can imagine
the horrible effect for anyone with geometry specs in their WM configs!

  2.4.x does the same, the difference is that there are slight changes
which files are read upon startup. I had a similar problem caused by a
config file I had in my home directory that wasn't used by 2.2 version
but is used by 2.4. Try to see which config files are read, use strace
and search for ^open. It should use the system config files in
/etc/X11/fvwm (you can see which one contains menu and check whether
that one is read).

I was sure I had checked that.  Oh, well, I obviously hadn't.
Thanks for you help.  I have Num-Lock on, and that seems to
have caused my problems.  (I'm not quite sure when I first had
this problem, but I have changed keyboards at some stage.)

Brian.

Ive just converted over to a new install of Debian 2.2r4 which uses fvwm
2.2.4. 

Below are the relevant sections of my .fvwmrc ( 1.24r)  and the new
.fvwm2rc (2.2.4)  files.  on my original setup I had 6 lines in the
InitFunction which were there to fire up 6 Xterms on the desktop in
prearanged places.  This worked fine. (Im not sure if it was the right way
of doign things.  but it worked and I never had any problem with it). 
WHen I converted over to 2.2.4, and include the six lines in the
InitFunction they dont work.  My questions are: 

1)  Is there a better way of doing that 
2)  Is there somethign blindingly obvious im missing 
3)  How do I do the equivilent in a 2.2.4 .fvwm2rc file. 
    What do I have to add to the initfunction ion the .fvwm2rc file to do
the equivilent of the six lines in the .fvwmrc file?

i just ran the command but the results are exactly the same.
Let me try running fvwm under CDE.

what else do you think is a possible problem??

thanks,

CDE may be modifying the tty settings of terminal windows or the
keyboard layout of the X server.  If you compare the output of

  $ stty -a 

from fvwm and CDE, are there any differences?  Likewise, is the
output of

  $ xmodmap -pk

identical?

You could also try running fvwm under CDE.  You can find the
instructions to set this up in question 2.2 in the fvwm FAQ.
