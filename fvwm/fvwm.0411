If a module does not respond anymore, fvwm freezes for up to 30
seconds.  The same might happen if an application grabs the X
server and does not release it (try killing off all applications
from the console).  Other than that, all hangs/crashes are bugs.

If there is a crash, can you look for the core file and fetch a
stack trace from it:

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

and post the output to fvwm-workers@fvwm.org (we need to know the
fvwm version too).

Ciao

Hi all,
I'm using fvwm 2.5.10 in my Debian (testing) and I've noticed some fvwm crash
with Lazarus and xmame.
The Lazarus IDE (installed from the binary in Debian's experimental) works well
but when I try to customize the GUI (like using Environment -> Editor Option)
by clicking on a font selector or a color selector, fvwm crash and X closes.
I also installed xmame (from binary in Debian's unstable) and I've noticed that
if DGA is enabled when I close the program fvwm crash, X closes but the 80x25
textmode console is not restored and I can only see the last X screen with some
pixel garbage around.

I also experienced the Lazarus problem with fvwm 2.4.x.

All this problems never happen on other window-managers (tried fluxbox and twm)
and without the window-manager.

My configuration: Pentium III 800Mhz, 192MB RAM, Kernel 2.6.8.1, Debian
(testing), Xfree 4.3.0.dfsg.1-8 (ATi Rage Pro chipset), Fvwm 2.5.10.
I'm not an expert fvwm user (and I'm not good in Linux at all :P ) so my Fvwm
configuration script is really simple.

Should I file a bug for this or are known problems? What can I do to help solve
this problem?

Thanx,
   Jenner

Is this a correct behavior, or a bug?

I set 

Style FvwmButtons NeverFocus

and then 

Style * FocusFollowsMouse

After that FvwmButtons start assuming focus when I move mouse over it which is not needed. If those commands are used in reverse order (i.e. FocusFollowsMouse first, and then NeverFocus) then FvwmButtons stop accepting mouse clicks.

I need that FvwmButtons accept mouse clicks but not keyboard focus, which is achieved with NeverFocus without using FocusFollowsMouse.

you have to change the order of your commands.

the
style *
overrides any other
style specialwindow
wihich was stated before.

But I already stated in my previous message that changing order doesn't do what I want.

Hi,

I'm trying to  use xnest, to work around the 255 clients limit of X.


so inside xnest, i'm launching  (of course) fvwm.

however, almost all my keybindings, mouse actions (thoses
called with a modifier) are interpreted by my main fvwm ;
so i can't resize windows with alt+click, i'm forced 
to try to grab the edge of the window to be resized to do that.
(alt+click resize the xnest window)

is there any way to pass every thing to xnest when xnest is focused ?

i looked at GrabFocus, FPGrabFocus, but it seems that
it's not what i'm looking for.

thanks

If you tell us the X server you are using, perhaps there
is a way to increase that.

What you are looking for is per window key bindings to override
the global bindings you've set for Fvwm.  Unless I haven't been
paying attention, I don't think there is a way to do that.

i tried :

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=233569

bottom line :Breaking binary compatibility
with Xlib modules is probably a very bad idea.

wouldn't it be nice to be able to do that ?

so if you want to use, say,
shift left and shift right to move your mouse for 10 pixels,
and in gnome-term you perfer using it for switching 
from tab to tab, you have the possibility ?

clobbering functions keys is pretty common...

(F1 is so sparsingly used that i use it for launching xterm...
however, when i need F1, i'd like to have the choice...)

thanks

Yep. & you can.

Key M A M Function Mail
Key (Xnest) M A M --

The above invokes my emailer (mutt) when I press Alt-M _except_ when an
Xnest window is focussed, whereby the Alt-M binding is passed through to the
(in this case) nested FVWM session.

The same logic can be used for your gnome-term windows or whatever else
you'd like.

This feature was introduced in FVWM 2.5.11.

Bye,

SCoTT. :)

Hello,

I use this to shade my windows with mouse wheel:
,-----
|Mouse 4 FISW N WindowShade True
|Mouse 5 FISW N WindowShade False
'-----
Mouse 4 works pretty fine, but as I have:
,-----
|Style * NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 1
'-----
it's kinda hard to get pointer in context FISW to unshade with Mouse 5
(in fact I am thinking about BorderWidth 0, which will make me real
trouble).

Is there another way to enlarge a window while shaded?  Can I add a
border for this state only?  Or can I set 'Title' for shade windows
only?  And: is there anything fvwm can't do?

Thanks in advance,
 regards, Frank.

Hi Frank,

> Is there another way to enlarge a window while shaded?  Can I add a
> border for this state only?  Or can I set 'Title' for shade windows
> only?

How about something like:

AddToFunc MyWinShade
+ I ThisWindow WindowStyle Title
+ I ThisWindow WindowShade True
AddToFunc MyWinShadeOff
+ I ThisWindow WindowStyle NoTitle
+ I ThisWindow WindowShade False
Key G A M MyWinShade
Key H A M MyWinShadeOff

Now Alt-G will shade the window & add a title, & Alt-H will unshade the
window & remove the title.

Of course, you can bind to mouse buttons instead of keys.

> And: is there anything fvwm can't do?

Usually not when Dominik is around. :)

Ooh! Wow! Thanks much Scott for bringing to my attention.

(And i thought i had read the "new features/changelog" close enough
to remember it myself.)


Now, i think that key binding syntax should be synchronized w/ one
of the existing syntaxes(?) (e.g. (Menu)Style, functions like Test)
.. not that i have any problems w/ the current (non)situation.

If you want your customary key combinations to go to the Xnest'ed fvwm try this oddity when Xnest has the focus: press the NumLock key, work in the Xnest window, unpress NumLock when finished in the Xnest window. It works with VNC - YMMV. If I needed this a lot I'd try to get the outer fvwm to press/unpress NumLock for me.

I've never got to the bottom of whether this is a bug, a feature or maybe even deliberate functionality. The outer fvwm ignores everything I do when NumLock is down because I don't have that modifier in any of my key combinations. This means the keys go through to the fvwm inside the VNC session. Somewhere along the line the NumLock modifier seems to get dropped, so by the time the keypresses reach the nested fvmw, they match my normal WM config. and do the expected operations on the windows in the nested session.

> Hi Frank,

Hello,

> > Or can I set 'Title' for shade windows only?

> AddToFunc MyWinShadeOff
> + I ThisWindow WindowStyle NoTitle

Thank you very much, I missed the WindowStyle.  With this and the stuff
from the last night I have this:
,-----
|DestroyFunc ToggleShade
|AddToFunc ToggleShade
|+ I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowStyle NoTitle
|+ I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
|+ I TestRc (1) Break
|+ I ThisWindow (!Shaded) WindowStyle Title
|+ I ThisWindow (!Shaded) WindowShade $0
'-----
and bind it to
,-----
|Key h TFISW CS Current ToggleShade West
|Key j TFISW CS Current ToggleShade South
|Key k TFISW CS Current ToggleShade North
|Key l TFISW CS Current ToggleShade East
'-----

This works (BTW: I could use something like 'TitleSide North'), but
looks kinda strange: when shading, first the window is shaded and then
the title is added (fine); when unshading, first the window is unshaded
and then the title is removed.  Both seem to happen in the wrong order,
don't they?  (It doesn't matter much, but some as it resizes the windows
content a bit this messes up some applications, that doesn't like this,
eg. my vim in GNU screen in xterm.)

Anyway, because this doesn't help very much for 'ToggleShade West' I
replaced 'NoTitle' with 'BorderWidth 1' and 'Title' with 'BorderWidth
8'.  This way another strange effect occurs (beside the wrong order):
then shading to North or East the top right corner (the border, not the
window content) of shaded and unshaded window stay the same place at
screen, which make the lower or left border, respectively, jump around
in a strange way; then shading West/South the right/top border of the
shaded window jump to the position of the left/bottom border of the
unshaded window.  Both goes for unshading, too.  Look at it then
unshading with WindowShadeSteps 25, the window content will jump around.

(Now I do a very bold assumption: this behavior is not configurable.)

I would appreciate something like this: preserve the position of window
content in all circumstances (Of course not in the direction of shade:
left/right for North/South and top/bottom for West/East.) and add the
window borders to the exterior.

> > And: is there anything fvwm can't do?
> Usually not when Dominik is around. :)

I know.  Dominik?  If this is not configurable, I would appreciate some
hints to the code and see, what I can do.

Thanks in advance,
 regards, Frank.

Please indent the commands with 2 spaces, to simplify copy-paste.

Try this function definition instead:

  DestroyFunc ToggleShade 
  AddToFunc ToggleShade 
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowStyle NoTitle 
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) UpdateStyles
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I TestRc (1) Break
  + I WindowShade $0
  + I WindowStyle Title

I am not sure I understand all you mean, but in order to get titles at
the left/right too, try this config:

  Key h TFISW CS Current ToggleShade Left
  Key j TFISW CS Current ToggleShade Bottom
  Key k TFISW CS Current ToggleShade Top
  Key l TFISW CS Current ToggleShade Right

  DestroyFunc ToggleShade
  AddToFunc   ToggleShade
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowStyle !Title
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) UpdateStyles
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I TestRc (1) Break
  + I WindowStyle TitleAt$0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowShade
  + I WindowStyle Title

Regards,
Mikhael.

Is there a way to tell fvwm which end up to place an xpm
file which is used for a button on a window title?

Thanks

Dear FVMUsers,
I am working with fvwm2 since a long time and find that it is a very nice windows manager. 
However I have a small problem that I would like to resolve. 
When I start many application and I iconise them the order of the icons stay not the same
during a session. I.e. I have emacs with 3 new frames (A, B and C), 
1) I iconise A then B and finally C, on my windows I have the icon of the frame A at left, B on
the middle and C right.
2) I reoppen C and B, and iconise C thenafter B in this case the frame A stays at left but C is
now on the middle and B right.
Is it not possible that the icons of the frame/applications will have the same position during
a session?
I whish to have nearly the same feature than SGI with 5dwm concerning the order of the icons.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Guillaume.

No. But it's trivial to rotate such images. If you have ImageMagick
installed, try:

convert -rotate 90 homer.xpm /tmp/side.xpm

Then just tell FVWM to use the rotated image.

I'm really sorry, the bug described above is _not_ in fvwm. I accidently
reallized, that this is a bug in ROX, which paints my desktop and only
hands over the buttons 1-5 to the windowmanager.

Thank you, I missed the UpdateStyles.

> I am not sure I understand all you mean,

The described problem seems to be more complex I thought (and has
nothing to do with the original subject).  By default a windows origin
(shaded or unshaded) used when moving, positioning etc. is the most
topleft corner of the window.  From my (very special) point of view it
would be more logical to position the topleft corner of the windows
content.  Now I have a switch somewhere in my config changing this
default to something I don't understand.  I will search for this, maybe
ask and describe the problem again.

> but in order to get titles at the left/right too, try this config:

Well, I am going to shade to any direction, the title is just a mean to
enlarge windows (viagra vor X) to catch shaded ones and unshade them, in
fact I don't need it.  Important is, that I am able to shade windows in
all direction: North, South, East, West.

Uh, I can concatenate commands from parameters?  Nice!  But WindowShade
without direction will only shade to a default direction (North,
AFAICS), won't it?  I could do something like

  Key h TFISW CS Current ToggleShade Left East
  # etc.

  DestroyFunc ToggleShade
  AddToFunc   ToggleShade
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowStyle !Title
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) UpdateStyles
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I TestRc (1) Break
  + I WindowStyle TitleAt$0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowShade $1
  + I WindowStyle Title

which seems a bit inelegant to me, but should work.

BTW: what's the difference of Current and ThisWindow?

Thanks again,
 regards, Frank.

Yes and no. The default direction is the title direction and you change
it in TitleAt<Something> command, so WindowShade does not need any param.

To make it elegant, remove the second param from ToggleShade function and
do "WindowShade $0".  "Left" is an alias for "East", so it will work too.
Or like in my sample, just do "WindowShade".  You may remove "false" too.

> BTW: what's the difference of Current and ThisWindow?

Well, I copied your config, but you may freely remove the Current word.

Key already makes the focused window to be the context window. And for
example PointerKey or Mouse make the window under the pointer to be the
context window. ThisWindow works on the context window.

If you need to check some window condition in a function, ThisWindow is
usually a more correct and safe way. Unless you really need to work on
the focused window regardless of the context window, then do "Current".

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hello again

thanks to Scott and Mikhael for helping with this Title thing.

There occures another strange effect then a windows style is BorderWidth
0 and it's unshaded.  This is my setup for now:

  Style * NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, WindowShadeSteps 25
  
  DestroyFunc	ToggleShade
  AddToFunc	ToggleShade
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowStyle NoTitle
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) UpdateStyles
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I TestRc (1) Break
  + I WindowStyle TitleAt$0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowShade
  + I WindowStyle Title
  
  DestroyFunc	StartFunction
  AddToFunc	StartFunction
  + I exec fvwm-root -r $HOME/.fvwm/backgrounds/background.png
  
  DestroyFunc	InitFunction
  AddToFunc	InitFunction
  + I Exec xterm +sb -g 128x48+120+75
  
  Key Left	TFISW CS ToggleShade Left
  Key Down	TFISW CS ToggleShade Bottom
  Key Up	TFISW CS ToggleShade Top
  Key Right	TFISW CS ToggleShade Right

I can shade, the title appears like a charm, but when I unshade the
window its content isn't refreshed anymore.  I made some screenshots:
<URL:http://www.der-frank.org/tmp/fvwm-shade.html>.  It happens with any
window I've tried (xterm, aterm, xcalc, FvwmConsole, mozilla).  The
application stayes alive, eg. if it's a shell, I can send commands to it
and close it, too.  Neither this, 'Refresh', 'RefreshWindow',
'UpdateStyle' nor 'UpdateDecor' make the window to redraw itself.  I can
issue a 'WindowStyle BorderWidth 0' again to the window to work around
this.  It doesn't happen with BorderWidth 1.

According to the manpage zero is a valid value for BorderWidth.  I am
using CVS from some hours ago.  What did I wrong?

Thanks in advance,
 regards, Frank.

Hi Frank,

> another strange effect then a windows style is BorderWidth 0

If you unshade before you remove the title it appears to work ok:

  DestroyFunc ToggleShade
  AddToFunc	ToggleShade
  + I ThisWindow (Shaded) WindowShade false
  + I TestRc (Match) WindowStyle NoTitle
  + I TestRc (Match) UpdateStyles
  + I TestRc (Match) Break
  + I WindowStyle TitleAt$0
  + I UpdateStyles
  + I WindowShade
  + I WindowStyle Title

SCoTT. :)

I am a newbie to FVWM, so please forgive me if I am asking navie topics.

I am using the .fvwm2rc from Tavis, and modified it to fit my box. But
some questions come out:

1. The transparent effect working fine with all applications excepte for
   gvim. Whenever I resize or minmize and then maxmize the gvim, it becomes
   blank, and I have to force "killall -9 givm" to close it. 

2. In my Debian box with the default xfce, OpenOffice works fine. However,
   after my moving to FVWM, the characters in the menu are TOO SMALL. The
   other applications seem fine.

3. Tavis put some FvwmButtons on the right edge, but I found it sometimes
   took up too much space. I want to make it dynamic as in a drawer, which
   can be opened and closed on demand. (search TODO in this mail)

Thanks in advance! Any advice will be appreciated!



PS: I would like to post my .fvwm2rc as following:

# Window, the sequence is a pattern on the grid above, so 14789 would be down then Right.

# First, define a StrokeFunc.
#
# Without this, you would have to execute all of your gestures entirely on the Root
# Window, This lets you change the Context and have a few other Neat Features, such as
# DrawMotion, which will draw a line as you make your Gesture (Neat!).
#
# There is also EchoSequence, Feedback and NotStayPressed.

# Note: EchoSequence prints sequences to STDERR.

# Name:     PackWindowUp
# Bound:    Alt+Shift+Up When a window is active
# Purpose:  Interrogate all windows on the current page, find the window with an edge
#           closest to active window, and slide the Active window upto that edge, or
#           the Page edge, if no window is in the way.
#
#           The Wrappers are required to look after the Context while we're testing
#           windows. Could also do it with a load of variables, but this is nicer.
#
#           See PackWindowLeft for a description of the logic (i know it looks a little
#           cryptic).
#
#           Sometimes terminals seem to need WindowRefresh, but 99% of the time it just
#           works, it creates a little flicker so I'll leave it out until it starts to bug
#           me.
#
#           Windows are also Raised, you can disable this.

# Purpose:  Shade or unshade the window when the Mouse wheel is rolled up or

#           argument `True` and rolling it down uses `False`, so rolling the wheel
#           down when the window isnt shaded has no effect, which I like :)

# FvwmPager is probably the most advanced desktop pager ever written,
# of course its highly configurable, has many advanced features, and can
# be made to look very eye candy.
#
# You can drag the Windows around inside the Pager, pull windows from
# other desktops out onto your current page, or drag the viewport into
# non-standard positions.
#
# This pager gets swallowed into my FvwmButtons Bar. The pages are seperated
# by solid white lines, the pager itself is tinted transparent and the colours
# lighten as focus and the viewport changes.
#
# You can write titles, or draw icons into the Windows, but i prefer to use
# the Balloons (tooltips) to find the Names.

I *think* this was a known issue with the vim developers. I suggest asking
on their mailing-list to see. Although I know of people using gvim just
fine with transparency. Odd. If you launch gvim from an xterm, is anything
printed to it, such as errors?

This could be the default font size for all your gtk apps.

This is available in FvwmButtons by using the "Panel" option to
FvwmButtons. There's a really good explanation of this in the man page for
FvwmButtons, under the section "CREATING PANELS".

Yes, a feature to "reuse" last position of an icon (if not obscured) would 
be nice.
I have vague memories of such a feature in 1.x, but maybe I'm wrong.
Nevertheless, it could possible be added som time.

I've just put up my fvwm configuration on my website and was wondering
how I get it added to the "FVWM - Desktop Screenshots" part of the
fvwm.org site.
It's not too complicated but shows off translucency/transparency,
hovericons, window snapshots, fvwm-script  and I'm quite proud of it :-)
I'm using it on a P-M 1.4 laptop and a US-II 440 Ultra 10 and it runs
fine on both.

Is this real transparency from the new xorg extension?

Hi list,
I know, this issue is already discussed, but I couldn't find any 
solution or answer in the internet....

I'm using fvwm 2.5.9-38 from suse
and when I open the presetation from Ooo, the presentation-window only 
appears with the size of editor window.
And when I fullsize the editor-window, the presentation-window already 
has a title-bar.

Where is the problem?

Michael

Hi all,
I try to configure my fvwm2 in the way, that if I want to get away from
a specific desk background picture to a colored desk, lets say solid
gray, then how can I get this done?

What should be the appropiate line(s) in the .fvwm2rc?

I'm not sure what you're asking, but let's assume that you have a 3x3
desktop (nine pages). If you want to make all of them use darkgrey, then
you'd use:

*DestroyModuleConfig FvwmBacker: *
*FvwmBacker: Command(Desk *, Page * *) - solid darkgrey

Ensuring that in your "StartFunction" you have the line:

+ I Module FvwmBacker

Does that answer your question? You can have a combination of pixmaps and
colours for different pages on desks -- see "man FvwmBacker".

A solution that works for me is to first set full screen mode within OO (under
view menu, last option IIRC, or Ctrl-Shift-j) and then start the presentation.

I used to have the same problem with full screen of Acrobat Reader.  
I solved it (with some help from Dominik) with the fullscreen 
functions in http://christal.elte.hu/~bognar/fvwm/.fvwm2rc.  Hope this 
helps.

Is there a way to make windows' titles BeOS like looking, i.e. short tabs instead of full width bars on top of windows? There seems to be nothing in the manual or FAQ on this topic.

Have a look at the following page:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/fvwm.html

Under the "ctwm" heading -- there's a screenshot to a BeOS theme here:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/img/ctwm-beostheme.jpg

The files related to it are here:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~josvanr/img/ctwm-beos.tar.gz

I haven't tested this.

Thanks a lot.
So it seems that fvwm can't do that (yet).
I just thought it was a nice feture to implement and was afraid that someone had already done it :-)

Hello !

Is it possible to add balloons or tooltips with FvwmIconMan ? With
small or generic icons, it is difficult to find which application we
want to deiconify.

Hey everyone.  Long time since I've been on this list, but I've not
needed to change my Fvwm2 config for a few years now.

Now something's changed.  I got a fancy new system with an Nvidia
TwinView card and two monitors.

I managed to get Xorg (6.7.0) booting with the native FreeBSD (5.3
RELEASE) NVIDIA driver, running both monitors with fvwm-2.4.19.

The split is done with the Nvidia drivers TwinView option, because I
couldn't quite get it done with the native nv drivers in xorg.  The
Fvwm config uses the XineramaSls features to get fvwm2 to split.

Everything works awesome.  Except one thing.  Firefox can't seem to
get transient windows (particularly javascript application popups) on
the right screen.

I have Firefox start in the bottom rightmost pane of the desktop, in
the right screen.  From the windowlist, after having turned NoGeometry
off, I found that it is being "placed" off the desktop to the right.

I'm not much at ASCII art, but this is what my 3x2 desktop looks like:

     /    0    \  /    1    \  /     2    \
   ==========================================
  /#      |      #     |      #      |      #
 0 #      |      #     |      #      |      #
  \#      |      #     |      #      |      #
   ========================================== - - -
  /#      |      #     |      #      |      #      |
 1 #      |      #     |      #  Y   |  F   #  X   |
  \#      |      #     |      #      |      #      |
   ========================================== - - -

"F" is where Firefox starts.
"X" is where it keeps trying to put that javascript popup.

Checking the windowlist in either of the 2x1 screens shows the window
as [Javascript Application] with geometry 517x112+2899+410.  Each
screen is 1280X1024, so that's clearly too far to the right - even for
me.

When I pull the window over and get an ID on it, the name is
[Javascript Application] (with the brackets) as is the icon name.  The
class is Firefox-bin, Resource is firefox-bin, and transient is set to
yes.  Gravity is set to NortWest, though I'm convinced it's not
sticking to that corner.

My firefox styles are as follows:
Style "Firefox*"    StartsOnPage 2 1, SkipMapping, StartsOnScreen 1
Style "Firefox*"    ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

My fvwm config has the following to say about transients:
Style *  DecorateTransient, UsePPosition, RaiseTransient

I've tried NoPPosition, UsePPosition, UseTransientPosition, and
StartsOnPageIncludesTransients.

That last one helps a great deal by placing the transient at "Y".
What I'd like is to get it right on top of Firefox at "X".

I searched the manpage for a StartsOnScreenIncludesTransients style
config, but there doesn't appear to be one.

Any ideas?

TIA
Lou

Hi,

I'm having some trouble with fvwm regarding gtk windows. I've searched 
the web for some time but without success.
I'm using using fvwm in order to have all dialogs appear centered on the 
screen, always on top and non-maximized.

But here is my problem, actually, I have 2 problems:

It seems that fvwm doesn't recognize gtk dialog as transcient, which 
means that I can't define specific things on
those dialog.

Does anyone knows anything about how to make fvwm recognize gtk dialog 
as transcient ? or am I doing something wrong ?

Furthermore, I'd want to do something else with those dialogs. I'm 
working on some project in which all main windows are
maximized and in fullscreen (i.e whithout decoration).
I'd like to have those dialogs decorated but it seems that if the main 
windows isn't decorated, there's no way to decorate any child dialog.

Once more, any help on that would be greatly appreciated

Please reply to the email below. Thanks.

Hi,

I would like to share my theme, which I've been making for the past half
year or so (well, not actively the whole time, but anyway).

Screenshot: http://whitecortex.net/~mikko/screenshot.png
RC: http://whitecortex.net/~mikko/shodan-fvwm2rc.html
Package: http://whitecortex.net/~mikko/shodan-fvwm2.tar.gz

It's nothing too fancy, but I do feel a bit proud about the window
titles, which use the multipixmap option. It's based on the scifi-
survival-horror-rpg game system shock2 by looking glass studios.
I've tried to make it as easy to install and configure as possible.

Mikko

Is it possible/doable to have the pager display both a window's icon and
its icon title?  Presently it's one or the other. I tried playing with
the code a bit and didnt succeed except for right after restart.

I'm running 2.5.12 on solaris 5.8.

Thanx

I am using a perl script of fvwm-theme (not the project of sf.net) to change my
decors dynamically. For example, the command: fvwm-theme -decor 23oz would generaet:

ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Pixmap 23oz/options_activeup.xpm
ButtonStyle 6 ActiveUp Pixmap 23oz/iconify_activeup.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp Pixmap 23oz/maximize_activeup.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 ActiveUp Pixmap 23oz/close_activeup.xpm
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown Pixmap 23oz/options_activedown.xpm
ButtonStyle 6 ActiveDown Pixmap 23oz/iconify_activedown.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 ActiveDown Pixmap 23oz/maximize_activedown.xpm

ButtonStyle 6 Inactive Pixmap 23oz/iconify_inactive.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 Inactive Pixmap 23oz/maximize_inactive.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 Inactive Pixmap 23oz/close_inactive.xpm
ButtonStyle All -- Flat UseTitleStyle
TitleStyle ActiveUp MultiPixmap Main 23oz/title_active.xpm, LeftEnd 23oz/titleleft_active.xpm, RightEnd 23oz/titleright_active.xpm
TitleStyle ActiveDown MultiPixmap Main 23oz/title_active.xpm, LeftEnd 23oz/titleleft_active.xpm, RightEnd 23oz/titleright_active.xpm
TitleStyle Inactive MultiPixmap Main 23oz/title_inactive.xpm, LeftEnd 23oz/titleleft_inactive.xpm, RightEnd 23oz/titleright_inactive.xpm
TitleStyle -- Flat

I integrate it in to Menu and use PipeRead 'fvwm-theme -decor 23oz', which works
fine.

However, I find it not so good to deal with too many decors for I have to write
the different command line. Then, I tried to use AddToDecor, and I changed the
script and gave the following output:

------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------

I do not know where I have made mistakes, because this output will not take
effect on the current opened windows as before. I have to open a new window to see the
effect. Moreover, if I put these codes in FvwmConsole directly, only some
windows will be affected.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!

First of all, sorry if I've missed something in the documentation
explaining how to do this, but I'm not quite certain what I should be
looking for.

Is there any way in fvwm2 that I can set things up such that a specific
window uses SmartPlacement if there is sufficient clear space available
on the desktop, but if it cannot be placed without overlapping another
window, then it is placed at a specified position (possibly its own
requested geometry)?

Can anyone suggest ways of accomplishing this?

Thanks.

Hi,

I'm using "EwmhBaseStruts 0 69 0 90", now I'm trying to position guifications 
window to the bottom right and I can't get it to ignore EwmhBaseStruts, so it 
actually gets positioned -69, -90 from the bottom right corner. Unfortunately 
I cannot specify the exact position of the Guifications window, since it only 
allows TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight positions via the 
configuration dialog. I've tried the following settings, but they have no 
effect to the window. They do however effect the Main Gaim and chat 
windows...

Style gaim      EWMHIgnoreStrutHints, EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea

I got the window name from `xwininfo -all` which is the same as the main Gaim 
window.

It works if I manually position it via the FuncFocusWindow (as described in 
FAQ Section 3.18), but then it positions all of the gaim windows...

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Ciao,
 Vili

I'm having a problem where my menus' submenus aren't being erased
before a new transparency/translucency is computed.  In creating a
stripped down version of my config, I have noticed that the problem
only occurs when menus overlap firefox.  If the popup overlaps a
firefox window and an xterm, only the portion overlapping firefox is
messed up.

This will sound a bit confusing, but this is what happens:
If I have a given menu, and select an item from the menu which pops up
a submenu, and then select an item above the current item that also
opens a submenu (still from the same original menu), I get the new
menu being drawn over top of the old menu and it doesn't completely
erase the old submenu.

I'm using gentoo, kernel 2.6.9-gentoo-r4 on a p4 3.2Ghz with 2GB RAM
however, I have the same problem on my home system (AMD 3200 xp+, 1.5
GB RAM, kernel 2.6.9).  fvwm version 2.5.12 with 'support for:
ReadLine, XPM, PNG, Shape, XShm, SM, XRender, XFT, NLS'

I have attached a stripped down version of my .fvwm2rc file.
Using the stripped down config, I can recreate the error by opening
firefox, then left-clicking on the root menu, next to a firefox
window, select the Systems menu, and then select Apps.  The Apps menu
will pop up before the Systems menu has been erased.

Any ideas why this happens?  Is this a bug in the translucent style? 
Am I using the translucent style incorrectly?

Any help is appreciated.

This one is pretty straight forward, it's a limitation of how the faked
translucency works.
Basically FVWM grabs a snapshot of the area where the menu will display
and uses that as the BG (plus tinting etc)
The problem you are hitting is that when a submenu is to come up FVWM
waits just a fraction of a second for the underlying windows to refresh
before grabbing the snapshot.  The trouble is that Firefox is not
updating its bit quick enough so FVWM is grabbing the non-updated area.
Xterm on the other hand is fast to update and so this issue is masked.
There is not much you can do about this sadly.

Looks like "Style <something> StaysOnTop" doesn't work.
When I enter this command in console, nothing changes, however, manual claims that it would move specified window to upper layer, namely "6" in default configuration.

Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

This is a known behaviour. Use "Layer 0 6" command to do what you want.

There is no currently way to do this. You may try TileCascadePlacement
and TileManualPlacement, these are close to what you want. The first
works pretty well.

Unfortunately, I have no time now to try the configurations you posted.
But why exactly do you need to add AddToDecor? Try to stick to the output
that works. Or explain the problem with the Suzanne's script again.

Also try UpdateDecor. However decors are not the suggested way to do it.

Mikhael.

27. November 2004 


Fr nur Fr. 9.90 muss jetzt der gesamte Restbestand des Familien- 
Silbers aus der ehemaligen Swissair First-Class via Internet weg! 

___________________________________________________________ 

        2  Edel-Tischtcher von First-Class Tischen gratis 
        dazu mit jeder Set-Reservation! --> Hchste Qualitt !! 
___________________________________________________________ 

 
Silber-Bestecke fr Fr. 9.90 gibt's sonst nirgendwo: 
 
Neuwertige Edel-Tafelbestecke zum Preis von gewhnlichem 
Chromstahl-Besteck (wie man es beim Billig-Discounter findet). 

___________________________________________________________ 

    *** Auf Wunsch liefern wir auch NEUWARE (nie gebraucht!) 
___________________________________________________________ 

 
Silber-Bestecke  Fr. 9.90 gibt's nur bei Swissair First-Class. 
 
(Das ist wie Billig-Airline zahlen und dann bei 
Swissair First-Class einchecken...) 
 
ALLES ORIGINAL AUS DER ERSTEN KLASSE DER SWISSAIR! 
 
Alles inkl. Swissair-Gravur! (FIRST-CLASS, nicht Business-Class!) 
 
BESCHRNKTES LIQUIDATIONSANGEBOT! (first come, first served) 
====================================================== 
 
Lsen Sie heute alle Ihre Weihnachtsgeschenk-Such-Probleme 2004: 

SWISSAIR Tafel-Bestecke NUR aus der First-Class, 
90g versilbert, das kann jeder brauchen und schtzen! 
 
+++ Diese Tafel-Bestecke waren ein exklusives Privileg der 
       Swissair First-Class Passagiere! Business-Passagiere 
       haben diese nie bentzen drfen. 
 
  --- Bild-Ansicht: http://www.swissair-firstclass.com 

====================================================== 

 Das 18-teilige SWISSAIR First-Class Besteck-Set besteht aus: 
 
 -- 6 versilberten Vorspeise-/Dessert-Messern 
 
 -- 6 versilberten Vorspeise-/Dessert-Gabeln 

 -- 6 versilberten Kuchengabeln 
 
 -- 2 Gratis First-Class Edel-Tischtchern, 68x47cm, bltenweiss.

 natrlich problemlos auch fr den Hauptgang verwendet werden.) 

*** Auf Wunsch liefern wir auch NUR NEUWARE (alles nie gebraucht!) 
*** Bitte ANKREUZEN auf Reservations-Talon unten. 

======================================================= 

Der Zustand der First-Class Bestecke ist neuwertig, die 
NEUWARE ist NEU, d.h. nie gebraucht worden. Wie ist das 
mglich? Nun, die Swissair rechnete damals nicht mit einem 
so raschen und bitteren Ende und es erfolgten wenige Monate 
vor dem Grounding noch Auslieferungen von Neuware, weil, 
man wrde es kaum glauben, Silber-Bestecke auch in der 
First-Class gar nicht selten verloren gingen. Diese 
wenigen Neuwaren knnen wir Ihnen heute exklusiv zuhalten, 
falls Sie jetzt schnell reservieren. 
 
Erfahren Sie Swissair Nostalgie pur, und das alles 
exklusiv nur aus der Swissair First-Class! 
 
Sichern Sie sich jetzt eine Swissair First-Class Erinnerung 
fr nur Fr. 9.90 pro Besteck-Teil, rund 85% unter dem Preis 
von irgendwelchen namenlosen Silber-Bestecken aus dem ffent- 
lichen Warenhaus, die zudem keinen dauerhaften (Erinnerungs-) 
Wert besitzen. 
 
    ***  Wir liefern trotz 85% Internet-Preisnachlass 
    ***  bequem per Versand und Rechnung. 
 
Sie sparen 85% gegenber dem Neupreis und erhalten dabei 
begehrte und unverwstliche Swissair Erinnerungsobjekte, 
die nicht einfach in irgendeiner Ecke verstauben, sondern 
bei jeder Bewirtung von anspruchsvollen Gsten eine besondere 
Attraktion darstellen. 
 
Auch als Weihnachtsgeschenk liegen Sie mit Swissair First-Class 
Tafel-Bestecken garantiert nie falsch! Ersparen Sie sich dieses 
Jahr die langwierige Geschenksuche und lsen Sie das Problem 
lieber schon heute kostengnstig mit einem garantiert fr alle 
Ihre Liebsten passenden Weihnachtsgeschenk: Swissair First-Class.

I fired up fvwm-themes in order to help get started with
building a nice fvwm environment for myself.  I really like
one of the themes that come bundled with it and I'd like to
use that as a basis for building my own. However, there is
no single config file for these themes.  As near as I can
tell, it reads a twisty maze of files under a share dir.
Is there a way to "dump" the config of FVWM at a given time
so that I might use it as my .fvwm2rc?

Thanks
GJ

fvwm-themes-config --expand-rc >long-fvwm2rc

Although the whole idea under fvwm-themes is not to have one long config,
but one small config for every logical thing, so you may just create your
own partial theme (a matter of one mkdir+cp command) with, for example,
only window buttons tweaked without a need to edit menus, and so on.

Mikhael.

I've been using FVWM for about 3 months now, and have grown quite
accustomed to my keyboard shortcuts. In particular, I use the Windows
Key for a ton of different things; I don't like to tie up Ctrl or Alt
because they are used a lot by other programs I use (for instance
IntelliJ). But I wanted to use a more standard key than Windows, in
case I'm on a laptop and don't have one available. I don't use the
Caps Lock for it's actual purpose, so I wanted to disable it as far as
capital letters is concerned and instead use it as a modifier. I think
I have used it as a modifier before (I'd have to dig through backup
copies of .fvwm2rc), but how can I disable it such that it won't make
my letters capital?

Thanks,

Give this to xmodmap:

remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Control = Control_L

Place this line in your XF86Config file where you define you
keyboard:

Option      "XkbOptions"    "ctrl:nocaps"

I think that needs to happen in the X config.  I'm using X.org on one
machine and XFree86 on another, and I am using the following line in
my keyboard sections for both:

        Option "XkbOptions"     "ctrl:nocaps"

Of course, you want to keep in mind that this (and the other
suggestions given in this thread) won't actually disable that key, it
will just convert it to another control key.

The X docs and xmodmap docs should contain details on giving it a
different function.

That got the caps lock to no longer output caps, but now it appears to
function the same as the Ctrl key. Is there something I need to add to
xmodmap? 

Thanks

The xmodmap manpage has the following for swapping the left control
and capslock:

            !
            ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
            !
            remove Lock = Caps_Lock
            remove Control = Control_L
            keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
            keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
            add Lock = Caps_Lock
            add Control = Control_L

I'm *guessing* that if you use just the first command, you'll either
get a plain shift key or a disabled key.

On the other hand, there is another entry in the manpage for the
'clear' command:

  clear MODIFIERNAME
    This removes all entries in the modifier map for the given mod-
    ifier,  where valid name are: Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2,
    Mod3, Mod4, and Mod5 (case does not matter in  modifier names,
    although  it  does  matter  for all other names).  For example,
    ``clear Lock'' will remove all any keys that were bound to  the
    shift lock modifier.

It looks like this is a little more definitive, so feeding the
following into xmodmap should turn the key off altogether:

     clear Lock


Can't hurt too much to experiment for the right affect.

I think I got it working. I ran

clear Lock
add Mod5 = Caps_Lock

through xmodmap and then reconfigured my key bindings in fvwm to use 5
instead of L.

I'll keep the thread posted if this doesn't work for some reason, and
please let me know if this seems bad for some reason.

Thanks to everyone for replying!

hi
i'm runnig linux debian unstable with fvwm 2.5.12 and wmacpi 2.0.
i wanted to make something like wm's wharf with wmacpi and some other
docklets.
but the problem is that when i run wmacpi it doesnt refresh it's
display.
it just keeps the same thing anf doesn't change a bit.
when i switch to another page/desktop and then come back - display of
wmacpi is refreshed, but again frozen.
i was able fo work around it using
Style wmacpi Iconic (if i recall correctly).
since then - it works. when i start wmacpi, it comes as icon, and
displays everything just fine.
but then i added it to my fvwmbuttons instance with simple
*depeszWharf: (1x1, Swallow(Close,Respawn,UseOld) 'wmacpi' 'Exec exec wmacp=
i')
and, to my surprise, i got exectly the same result as before - i.e. it
doesn't refresh itself.

do you have any clue on what might be broken?

best regards

depesz

Hi

I tried to call FvwmAnimate out of FvwmIconMan with fvwm 2.5.12 (Debian
Sarge). I have disabled the Icons and I want to animate the 
iconification process of windows which are being iconified. The 
manpage of FvwmIconMan sais something about NoIconAction. I
tried to copy the example from the manpage, but it doesen't work. 

This is my configuration (stripped):

Module FvwmAnimate
Style * NoIcon
*FvwmIconMan: NoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate
Module FvwmIconMan

But I don't see any Animations :( When I invoke 'SendTo Module 
FvwmAnimate animate 100 100 10 10 0 0 0 0' (or anything like that) from
the FvwmConsole, I  can see animations. They appear as well if I don't 
disable Icons in the config.

I guess I've misunderstood the meaning of NoIconAction, but what am I 
doing wrong exactly?

Regards, Mathias

This seems to be a bug of wmacpi, at least in the debian version:

I'm not sure, but modules should always be started from
the StartFunction.
