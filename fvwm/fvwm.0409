Hi All,

I am having fvwm 2.4.3 with me. I am using fvwm95 style in my PC.

In my mozilla browser (ver 1.3), The popup menus are coming with out close
button at the right corner of the window.

Similar way for the Preference selection window, I am getting only minimize
button.

How to get all the three buttons for the mozilla windows?

In Mozilla in Fullscreen mode hides my Taskbar. How to prevent this also?

With Regards,
L. Subbiah

How should I configure my fvwm to handle focus with mozilla some sane
way. I prefer sloppy focus.

I have tried several different styles for mozilla, but found
suitable. I want mozilla to get focus when mouse enters, but I also
want to chage focus with keyboard (alt-tab & other combinations). Now
I have this:

Style mozilla*   NeverFocus, NoLenience 
Style Mozilla*   NeverFocus, NoLenience 

So mozilla won't get focus with mouse, but with keyboard yes. Any
ideas how to improve situation?

(fvwm 2.4.18)

I use:

    AddToFunc FollowUp "I" Current [!Sticky] Stick
    + "I" Desk -1
    + "I" Stick

    Key     Up     A       SCM     FollowUp

Hi folks,

How can I tell fvwm to completely ignore lower layers for
placement?

According to the documentation I would have to set

Style *				MinOverlapPlacement
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties	1 5 1 1 0 50


But even though the value for "below" is set to 0, the
lower layers are _not_ ignored.


???


Regards

Harri

Hello support-center,

I am the proud owner of a Logitech Mx310, a Mouse with 8 buttons
(including the wheel). Button 8 is not detected by X, but the buttons 6
and 7.
Now I want to use the buttons 6 and 7 with fvwm, which does not work.

Mouse 6 R A DynMenu

Is this an my fault, or a missing feature (fvwm 2.5.10 with
gentoo-patches)?

Best regards
        Klaus

I don't understand what the problem is.  What you wite suggests
that you want

  Style Mozilla* SloppyFocus

Why do you think this is no "sane way" of focus handling?

Try

  Style * NoFuncHint, NoDeconHint

This tells fvwm to ignore the hints that disable these buttons
(actually, one of these styles is sufficient, but I don't know
which one).

You can't make the mozilla window smaller because fullscreen mode
means the whole screen, regardless of what's on it.  You can put
the Taskbar on a higher layer, e.g. with

  Style FvwmTaskBar Layer 20

In 2.5.x, the EwmhBaseStruts command defines aread near the screen
edges that are not used by maximized windows, but that does not
affect fullscreen windows.

With the latest development version that will be released as
2.5.11 (latest CVS snapshot), you can define a window specific
binding that works on all windows but FvwmIconMan:

  Mouse (!FvwmIconMan) 1 4M Close

Hint:  Did you look at the error message generated by the binding?

In general, fvwm supports all button numbers up to 9, but X
supports any button > 5 only partially.  There are no bit masks
for these buttons in X, so dragging with these buttons or running
complex functions does not work.  However, you should be able to
bind a simple function like

  Mouse 6 R A Raise

or

  Mouse 6 R A Schedule 0 DynMenu
 =20
If this does not work, it's a bug in fvwm.

Ciao

The syntax is wrong.  Try

  Style * MinOverlapPlacement
  Style * MinOverlapPlacementPenalties 1 5 1 1 0 50

Or if you prefer both styles on one line, separate them with a
comma.

I think the FAQ is obsolete.  The Fvwm core *should* support
buttons 6 to 9 out of the box.  I've taken the opporunity to
revisit the whole issue and made numerous patches to the core and
the modules.  Now, up to 9 buttons are supported out of the box,
and up to 31 can be enabled by modifying the
NUMBER_OF_EXTENDED_MOUSE_BUTTONS macro in libs/defaults.h.

Ciao

Well, you can put that one on an even higher layer, but I see no
better way than that.

  Style windowname Layer 21

Where the windowname is probably FvwmButtons (?).

Hi All,

I am having fvwm 2.4.3 with me. I am using fvwm95 style in my PC.

In my mozilla browser (ver 1.3), The popup menus are coming with out close
button at the right corner of the window.

Similar way for the Preference selection window, I am getting only minimize
button.

How to get all the three buttons for the mozilla windows?

In Mozilla in Fullscreen mode hides my Taskbar. How to prevent this also?

With Regards,
L. Subbiah

Hi folks,

How can I tell the fvwm placement manager to ignore lower
layers completely? According to the man page this should
work:

Style				*	MinOverlapPlacement
MinOverlapPlacementPenalties		1 5 1 1 0 50

Please note the 0 for the "below" value. But it does not
work as expected.


???

Harri

Hi,

I'll interfere into the thread, because I'm tying to do something
similar to the presented below:

<cut> 
> This is the best version of the function I managed to write:
> 
> --
> Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus

Am I missing something, or the function above isn't used? ;-)

> # If FvwmButtons has focus when calling this function raise it
> DestroyFunc AutoRaiseFunction
> AddToFunc AutoRaiseFunction
> + I All (!Iconic, !Focused, FvwmButtons) Iconify on

<cut>

In my version instead of iconyfying, I just change layer of the window.
And it works, but only for one panel at each edge (because there cannot
be two windows focused at the same time).
I can add a script to choose witch panel to focus depending on the mouse
position when EdgeCommand is executed, but it isn't comfortable (I had
to choose panel before I can see it - default layer for my panels is 0)
EdgeCommand is called only once on EnterEvent for the edge, so there
isn't possibility to choose window to raise when moving mouse on the
edge. 
That's why I've added new command EdgeLeaveCommand which works like
EdgeCommand, but is executed on LeaveEvent. I've posted patch to
fvwm-workers mailing list couple of days ago. Is there any chance to
include this in fvwm? And if not, then is there any other way to choose
for many panels on one edge of screen with the above functions?

Did you ever solve that problem. I find it quite annoying.

Put

  BugOpts ExplainWindowPlacement on

in your fvwm config file (2.5.10 or later).  Fvwm then prints a
detailed explanation of why and how new windows are placed.  The
output should enable us to find out what's going on.

By the way, I just checked the sources, and there is no way fvwm
ignores the SkipMapping style (unless it's overridden by another
style).

Ciao

I've tried that. If I'm on desk 0, the output I get is:

[FVWM][__explain_placement]: placed new window 0x2a00002 'GIMP Startup':
  desk 0 (specified by style)
  current page
  position 488 362  (used program specified position)

[FVWM][__explain_placement]: placed new window 0x2a00a5d 'The GIMP':
  desk 0 (specified by style)
  current page
  position 0 61  (used user specified position)

[FVWM][__explain_placement]: placed new window 0x2a00af1 'The GIMP':
  desk 0 (specified by style)
  current page
  position 964 64  (used user specified position)

This corresponds to the splash screen and the two gimp windows. I only
have 1 page per desk. The style option is:

Style "Gimp*" StartsOnDesk 3, SkipMapping, RandomPlacement

Thanks for any help.

Chris

Just tired that. It doesn't work for me, but I'm still using
2.5.8. BTW, I've

    Style * SkipMapping

and no styles with ShowMapping in my config. So, I assume that this is
either a bug in FVWM 2.5.8 or Gimp 2.0.2 uses a special feature to
circumvent SkipMapping.

Some conclusions:

  1) The output of the ExplainWinowPlacement option is broken (it
     shows the current desk, not the target desk).  I'll fix that.

  2) Fvwm did *not* ignore SkipMapping and did *not* switch desks
     when the window was placed.

  =3D=3D> The application must have caused it.  Probably the
      application used the ewmh interface to switch desks.

Try to comment out the "gogo_desk(...)" call in fvwm/ewmh_events.c
in the ewmh_CurrentDesktop function.  If my theory is correct,
this should suppress the problem.

If this really is the cause, contact the gimp developers and ask
them to remove this mis-feature.  If they want all windows on one
desk, they should use the window group hint and hope all windows
are placed on the same desk as the group leader.

This doesn't make any difference. However Tavis' suggestion

does work. It's the "!FPFocusByFunction" that fixes it.

Thanks Tavis -I would never have guessed that myself.

xwd is fast ! works really great.
however montage, trying to glue 70 1280x1024 images together, almost 
killed my box. but that's fine, i can deal with that.

Hi, there,

Each time I restart FVWM I want an xterm started at the center of page
0, a firefox
at top left of page 1, thunderbird at page 2....
I am wondering if there is a way to do it in the StartFunction?
Thanks for your input.

Something like this may help you:

+ I GotoPage 0 0
+ I Exec exec xterm
+ I Wait xterm
+ I Current PipeRead "echo Move `expr $[vp.width] / 2 - $[w.width] / 2`p `expr $[vp.height] / 2 - $[w.height] / 2`p"

+ I GotoPage 1 0
+ I Exec exec firefox
+ I Wait "Mozilla Firefox"
+ I Current Move +0 +0

+ I GotoPage 2 0
+ I Exec exec thunderbird
+ I Wait "Mozilla Thunderbird"
+ I Current Move +0 +0

It can be placed in your StartFunction or (may be it's more useful) in
InitFuntction.

Hi all,

I'm using an autohide FvwmButtons window like FAQ 7.17 with this
config to control the visual effect:

Style Buttonbar WindowShadeScrolls, WindowShadeSteps 1p, WindowShadeBusy

The window shades too fast for my liking - even when using the most
CPU-intensive options. Does anyone know of a way to slow it down a fraction?

SCoTT. :)

You can't bind complex functions to this button.  To suppress this
warning, use: Silent Mouse 6 R A DynMenu

Well, it seems, that there is a bug, it does not work here. :-(

I have 2 sticky Eterms that I launch at startup.  I have a function to 
(un)hide them via shading.  The trouble is that each time I do a shade and 
unshade, they have moved up and to the right by 1 pixel (which make sense 
because that's the shade direction).

I played with the MoveByProgramMethod and the FixedPPosition styles, but 
to no avail.  I finally traced the problem to the MWMDecor style.  Is this 
a known issue?

I'm using version 2.5.10.

I investigated this further.  I found that MWMDecor isn't necessarily the 
cause.  Here's a config file that reproduces the problem.  I've found a 
workaround so this is purely for anyone who encounters something similar.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Minimal config to recreate Eterm windowshade bug.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AddToFunc InitFunction

	Exec exec Eterm --geometry 120x25+190+0 --trans --shade 50 --scrollbar 0 
--buttonbar 0 --borderless --name DesktopEterm &
+ I 	Schedule 1000 None (DesktopEterm2) \
	Exec exec Eterm --geometry 120x25+190+385 --trans --shade 50 --scrollbar 
0 --buttonbar 0 --borderless --name DesktopEterm2 &

# this one works
Style DesktopEterm* TitleAtRight, !Borders, NoDecorHint

# these three don't: Eterms shift
#Style DesktopEterm* MWMDecor, TitleAtRight

Use more complex window decorations and the style

  Style * WindowShadeBusy

Other than that, there is currently no way to slow it down even
more.  It might be worthwhile to add another style
WindowShadeStepDelay that usleep()s for the given amount of time
between two steps.

No, it still does not work. Is it possible, that this is a Problem with
the x.org-XServer? xev shows the correct button and Firefox uses them
correctly.

I see.  EWMH is indeed the culprit.  Gimp sends an "activate
window" message to fvwm which in turn switches to the window's
desk by running the EWMHActivateWindowFunc function:

  DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
  AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I Iconify Off
  + I Focus
  ^^^^^^^^^
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

The !FPFocusByFunction works because it disables the Focus
function which switches desks.

You can replace this with something like

  DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
  AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I ThisWindow (!Gimp*) Iconify Off
  + I ThisWindow (!Gimp*) Focus
  + I ThisWindow (!Gimp*) Raise
  + I ThisWindow (!Gimp*) WarpToWindow 50 50

Or with current CVS (I had to fix a bug first):

  DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
  AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
  + I ThisWindow (Gimp*) break
  + I Iconify Off
  + I Focus
  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

Ciao

Problem was only with mozilla. Apparently mozilla is doing something
to focus based on mouse events. I had this function binded to alt-tab
and others:

AddToFunc   oma-focus-and-raise
+ "I" Focus
+ "I" WarpToWindow 50 50 
+ "I" Raise

With that function and sloppy focus mozilla was quite funky. I had
two mozilla windows side by side. Swithcing between them with keyboard
resulted situation where keyboard events went just to another window
where fvwm commanded it. Specially annoying it was with overlapping
windows. Window which was covered by other window was getting events!

But just changing this function a bit will make everything work as
wanted:

AddToFunc   oma-focus-and-raise
+ "I" WarpToWindow 50 50 
+ "I" Focus
+ "I" Raise

Aha!  It's the annoying keystrokes-in-mozilla-go-to-wrong-window
problem.  I've been chasing this problem for month but was never
able to reproduce it at will.  Maybe I can with the new
information.

Do you know of a way to make it happen all the time?

At least for me it happens all the time. For me it is reproducible
every all the time. I have normally only mozilla windows accessible
with alt-tab, and when switching between them, after few changes
situation is there. Normally windows overlap something like 70% on
width, and are full height.

If this is not enough for you to reproduce the problem I can send you
my .fvwm2rc, screenshots, whatever.

To save the Dominik's work, send a minimal rc file ~/.fvwm/mozilla-bug
that contains several lines like Style mozilla-bin, Key, Exec mozilla.
This file would be called as "fvwm -f mozilla-bug" and should show the
problem after pressing certain keys.

Mikhael.

Hi All,

I am new to the FVWM world and new to window managers in Linux in 
general, although I've been on the CLI a while. Is there any good online 
documentation for FVWM? Thanks,

Zach

The solution posted has effectively saved my life. I am using the
default focus style for firefox, and have the following key bindings:

Key Tab   A    M    Next (CurrentGlobbalPageAnyDesk, CurrentDesk, !iconic) SelectWindow
DestroyFunc SelectWindow
AddToFunc SelectWindow
+ "I" Focus
+ "I" Iconify false
+ "I" Raise
+ "I" WarpToWindow 50 50

I can reliably but only randomly reproduce this problem everyday. I have
two firefox windows open side by side. And it seems to happen more
often when I highlight in one window(text area or url bar), then use
Alt-Tab to switch focus. Hopefully this helps.

Regards,
Shao.

What is your gcc version? If you still get the same internal error on
your platform after upgrading to the latest version (3.4 or 3.5), then
you should probably send a bug report as suggested in the error message.

Try also to run this gcc line manually in fvwm/ subdirectory without
"-g -O2" options, there is a very small hope.

Regards,
Mikhael.

All:

How do I go about enabling anti-aliasing on my fonts?  I'm running FVWM
v2.5.10, and I see that it does have support for anti-aliasing, but I'm
not sure what all I need to do to get that enabled.

How can you tell if you have it enabled?  (Maybe I do and just don't
know it.)

Thanks.

Search for /FONT sections in the man page.

  % fvwm-config --info | grep anti-alias

Hello.

Usually <Control>+<Left click> over a selected URL
in gnome-terminal opens that URL in the default
gnome browser. That works for me both in GNOME
and IceWM, but not in FVWM. What should I have
to do to make work also in FVWM? Any help?

Just tried, works for me. Check that you don't have some binding like:

  Mouse 1 W C something  # do something on Ctrl-click

(or maybe "A" or "WTFS" instead of "W", or "0" instead of "1").

If you think you don't have such binding, start fvwm with no fvwm2rc file
and then invoke gnome-terminal from the internal menu (from xterm).

Mikhael.

Hello,=20

I am in the Land of exploding xsession-errors files...

I am using 2.5.10 and fvwm filles up my ~/xsession-errors with:

  ____ ( '/home/michelle/.xsession-errors' ) ___________________________
 /
|  s   0/765  0/ 2, g   2/763  2/ 0: +++ near border traditional 0x08154a00=
 'FvwmTaskBar'

One time at start up and then starting a program (here 'gaim')

|  _cdim: --- not moved 0x08154d28 'Anmeldung'

and then millions of lines like this

|  _cdim: --- using StaticGravity 0x08154d28 'ButtonBar1'

while open and closing one of my two ButtonPanel
Moving a window arround gives me tonns of messages too.

 \______________________________________________________________________

I think, this is inacceptable...=20
How can I deactivate logging of this crap ?

Greetings
Michelle

Hi!

There is an example in the fvwm man page showing a method to auto raise
and lower panel when mouse poiter hit edge of the screen. It uses
FvwmAuto and EdgeCommand function. It works very well, but only for 1
panel for each edge (because of using focus to decide if window should
be raised or lowered).

Here begins my problem. I have 3 panels on one edge of the screen (2
FvwmButtons and 1 FvwmPager). I want them to be separate panels. But
using earlier metioned method from man page there isn't any possibility
to decide which panel to raise when hitting edge (well, I can script it
to make a decision based on pointer position when hitting edge, but
it meens aiming without target visibility ;-) ).

Here begins my solution. I've added new command for fvwm
"EdgeLeaveCommand", based on the EdgeCommand, but reacting on
LeaveNotify Event. So now I can raise all 3 panels to show me "target",
and set focus on one only, when mouse pointer is leaving edge. This way
I can see where I should move mouse to choose exacly this panel wich I
wanted.

If anyone knows a better solution, no needing patching fvwm, then please
comment here.

I'va attached patch on current CVS with my update's adding
EdgeLeaveCommand.

I am writing a fvwm perl module and anticipate wanting to parse the
window_flags data upon receiving each M_ADD_WINDOW event.  Looking
through the FVWM perl modules I did not see any function for doing
this, and before going to the trouble to translate the bit-fields in
fvwm.h to perl I thought I would ask if it has already been done (and
I just didn't look hard enough:-)  This will be my first FVWM perl
module so I apologize if this is a FAQ.

TIA.

I have it open window 2 and then i move window 2 to desk y.
Going to the window 2 on desk y, i open up window 3.
App starts window 3 on original desk x.

How do i get window 3 to open on desk y, the one i'm on.

I cant use StartsOnDesk, cuz i dont always want it on a certain desk,
just the one i'm on.

I'm on 2.5.10 on solaris 8.

Unfortunately, the flag locations differs from platform to platform and
from compiler to compiler. If you (or anyone) wanted to write a robust
version, it would have to do a compile of a C program during the build of
fvwm, and produce some perl code from the result.

I've done it for individual flags, but my process is entirely manual
because I'm only using two or three flags.

Fvwm forces new windows onto the same desk if one of two
conditions is met:

  1) The new window is a transient of the old one.

     Currently, there is no way to prevent this effect.  All you
     can do is to use FvwmEvent to move the new window to the
     current desk.  (A patch is welcome, look at placement.c,
     around line 1250).

  2) The new window is in the same window group, and the old
     window is the group leader.

     In this case, use

       Style <appname> ScatterWindowGroups

The proper solution is to serialize the flags without dumping C
structures. Here is a discussion:
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0407/msg00186.html

It is not very hard to implement what is suggested in the link without
removing the current complier dependent flags. The hard part is to decide
on the 50 most useful flags to be packed in two integers; I don't think
we need to pass more flags, no modules use them. But I currently don't
have a time to implement this in fvwm. Unfortunately.

If someone implements this, I will try to find the time to support these
packed flags in perl stuff, including FvwmDebug and WindowList tracker.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I want to achieve window-local keymaps.
I found FvwmKb. However, I cannot install it.
I'm using debian sid's fvwm 2.5.10

I get an error 
checking moduledir... configure: error: Can not determine fvwm modules directory

even if I specify --with-moduledir=/usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.10

Any suggestion, or other solution to use?

thx
Gergo

Yes, I realized the difficulties involved in a Perl only solution,
which is why I had hopes it was already done for me :-) While I was
sleeping I came upon a simpler, but less general solution to the
problem I was trying to fix: Since I know the names and classes of the
Windows I want to treat in a special manner, there is no need to base
my decision on the flags of the windows, I can just put a hash naming
the "special" windows in my perl module, and just update it as I
encounter new "problem" applications.

What are your feelings about adding a C Perl module to the FVWM perl
modules which would do this?  My only experience with writing C/C++
Perl modules consists of working through the examples and exercises in
books on Perl, but it sounds like it might be a faster route to a
solution (faster than for me to learn the internal operations of the
fvwm code well enough to hack in another event to fvwm as
msg00186.html suggests.)  The biggest problem I can see with adding a
C Perl module to fvwm's perllib, is in the build process on unknown
platforms -- not everyone is going to even have their systems in a
state that is capable of compiling a C Perl module (old Redhat Linux
systems come to mind).

Ah, yes. The correct solution is always to work with both code bases (C
and Perl) to get an efficient cross-platform solution. As JAPH, however, I
tend to fix things in Perl because it means I don't have to risk breaking
other people's code. Nonetheless, Mikhael is right. If someone's going to
do this, and they have the support of the rest of the community, it should
be in the C code base.

That said, I would vote to see the export of all of the flags, or we might
regret our choices later.

Another possibility is to have Fvwm do a dump of flag names and bit
offsets to all modules on startup. This would allow us to use all 384 bits
with a small amount of startup overhead, and would even ensure that
modules work if they are running on different platforms from fvwm (a
situation that I don't personally foresee, but I haven't been thinking
about these things long).

The suggestion was not to add a new event, but new M_ADD_WINDOW fields,
as said in the reply to that message.

There are multiple reasons why I don't like to compile anything Perl
specific, but if you want to go this path, you may try. The "make" step
may compile and run some C program that generates Perl class
FVWM::WindowFlags. There is a problem then of maintaining this program,
it would be a lot of annoying code that duplicates the huge non-flat
window_flags structure in C. I prefer the solution with 50 most useful
flags to be packed and sent to modules, so that it would not be perl
specific, this does not really require maintainance, since the most
useful flags are not likely to be removed. But I don't care to support
all 300 flags if someone wants to maintain this generating program.

Just please keep in mind that currently the Perl stuff is fully
transparent, it is not even required that Perl is installed before
installing fvwm. I want to continue with this.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Hi,

I'm trying screenshots my way-too-big desktop,
and i'd like to know if there is a window on the screen,
or the names of the windows. (i don't want to screenshot
screens with nothing, or a stick pager/xclock/xosview)

Tavis said to use 
> use Any (CurrentPage) DoStuff..

but i don't know where to begin with this..


thanks.

Ah -- I misunderstood: I saw the reference to the M_OLD_ADD_WINDOW and
thought you wanted to revive it, and did not think to read the
followups to that post.

I agree with everything you say.  Arranging for the building of perl
c-modules on unknown and unseen systems is a daunting task -- I have
often had to modify modules I have downloaded from CPAN in order to
get them to build, even on the most up to date and correctly
configured systems.

But I really like your suggestion about a C program which will
generate a perl only FVWM::WindowFlags, and I will look into doing so.

I'm not sure but I'm pretty positive that "fvwm" itself was already compiled,
leading me to believe that "Xext" is really there.  I believe that gcc is an
up-to-date version as I just installed cygwin.  Any advice?

Hello.

Is it possible to have icons automatically resized to
a given size in the FVWM menus?

I use icons from many themes installed in my system
(Gentoo Linux and Fedora Core) by the package management
tools and would not like to make copies of them in
order to have them in the desired size.

What I would like to have is the window manager
resizing them on the fly, like in IceWM.

Regards.

Romildo

Try something like

  Any (CurrentPage) make_a_screenshot_of_the_current_page

In other words, the command given in the "Any" command is executed
if any window matches the given condition (hence the name).

o But I really like your suggestion about a C program which will
o generate a perl only FVWM::WindowFlags, and I will look into doing so.

I reiterate the suggestion that this be done on module startup, rather
than by file generation. Then, rather than adding a file to the
distribution, you simply generate a set of M_CONFIG_INFO messages

M_CONFIG_INFO FlagBit WINDOW_HAS_TITLE 134
M_CONFIG_INFO FlagBit WINDOW_IS_STICKY_ACROSS_DESKS 0
M_CONFIG_INFO FlagBit STYLE_IS_TRANSIENT 150

The Perl code to record and decode things this way is obscenly short:

$module->addHandler(M_CONFIG_INFO,\&config_info_handler);

sub config_info_handler($)
{
  my ($self, $event) = @_;
  my @tokens = getTokens($event->_text);
  $flag_bits{$tokens[1]} = $tokens[2] if ($tokens[0] eq 'FlagBit');
}

sub flag_bit($$)
{
  my ($event,$flag_name) = @_;
  return undef if (!exists($flag_bits{$flag_name}));
  my $bit = $flag_bits{$flag_name};
  return ord(substr($event->_window_flags,int($bit/8),1))>>($bit%8))&0x1;
}

The C code is the same as what Mark has been talked about for a C -> Perl
module, and I've written it already for another project, although it's not
to Fvwm coding standards. It's not elegant, but brute force is all we can
get because of the implementation-dependent style of the C standard.

#define FIND_BIT(x) \
   { SET_##x(with,1);  \
     find_bit(##x,with,without); \
     SET_##x(with,0); }

unsigned find_bit(char         * name,
                  window_flags * with,
                  window_flags * without)
{
  for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(wf) * 8); ++i)
  {
    unsigned bitIndex = i % 8;
    unsigned byteIndex = i / 8;
    unsigned char byte = ((unsigned char *)&wf)[byteIndex];
    unsigned char bit = (byte >> bitIndex) & 0x1;
    unsigned char bytet = ((unsigned char *)&wft)[byteIndex];
    unsigned char bitt = (bytet >> bitIndex) & 0x1;
    if (bit != bitt)
      printf("M_CONFIG_INFO FlagBit %s %d\n",name,bit);
  }
}

unsigned dump_window_flags()
{
  FvwmWindow with;
  FvwmWindow without;
  FIND_BIT(DO_SHRINK_WINDOWSHADE);
  FIND_BIT(DO_LOWER_TRANSIENT);
  FIND_BIT(DO_STACK_TRANSIENT_PARENT);

  ...

}

Hi,

I've send a message couple of days ago with similar subject like this
one, but never get any response and as I see it never appeared in archive
(or more precisely it is in raw archive, but not on the thread listing)

Below is the copy of this message. If anyone interested I have a patch
on current CVS sources adding EdgeLeaveCommand metioned in the post.

Now the actual problem:
=================

There is an example in the fvwm man page showing a method to auto raise
and lower panel when mouse poiter hit edge of the screen. It uses
FvwmAuto and EdgeCommand function. It works very well, but only for 1
panel for each edge (because of using focus to decide if window should
be raised or lowered).

Here begins my problem. I have 3 panels on one edge of the screen (2
FvwmButtons and 1 FvwmPager). I want them to be separate panels. But
using earlier metioned method from man page there isn't any possibility
to decide which panel to raise when hitting edge (well, I can script it
to make a decision based on pointer position when hitting edge, but
it meens aiming without target visibility ;-) ).

Here begins my solution. I've added new command for fvwm
"EdgeLeaveCommand", based on the EdgeCommand, but reacting on
LeaveNotify Event. So now I can raise all 3 panels to show me "target",
and set focus on one only, when mouse pointer is leaving edge. This way
I can see where I should move mouse to choose exacly this panel wich I
wanted.

If anyone knows a better solution, no needing patching fvwm, then please
comment here.

==================

PS. Sorry for my english. ;-)

Your patch made it to the list.

Apparently none of the developers have decided to apply it yet
or make a comment.

Give them time and if you don't hear from anyone, keep trying,
exactly like you've been doing.  Sometimes these thinks take a while.

Lost my HD. Just got everything back up last night. For some reason, I 
never backed up my fvwm config.  I've got a week's worth of work to 
catch up on and every minute counts. Someone have a twm style .fvwm2rc 
handy? I don't care about looks, just something to get me through Oct 
15. I'm finding it hard to change my habits (to meet the default Suse 
config) under this type of pressure. I just need the toolbar config, 
everything else is fine in the default.

Thank you very much.

If someone is willing to knock this out from a similar config, my old 
config was:
Left Button - iconify
Right Button - resize
Double Click Titlebar - maximize
Middle Click Titlebar - window operations list including scroll
Right Click Titlebar/Sides/Buttons - lower
Left click Titlebar/Sides - RaiseLower
Left Click drag Titlebar/Sides/Buttons - Move

TIA. I have grown unfamiliar with the config language, so doing this 
myself would take the better part of an evening.

 -Shay

Hi,
is it possible to have focus move to nearest window, after closing
a window? I tried the following:

*FvwmEvent-NewWindow: StartDelay 4
*FvwmEvent-NewWindow: add_window FuncFocusWindow
*FvwmEvent-OldWindow: Cmd
*FvwmEvent-OldWindow: PassId
*FvwmEvent-OldWindow: destroy_window FuncFocusWindow
DestroyFunc FuncFocusWindow
AddToFunc FuncFocusWindow
	+ I ThisWindow ("My Window") Move 200p 100p
	+ I Focus
	+ I WarpToWindow 50p 50p
AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-NewWindow
FvwmEvent-OldWindow

I think the Oldwindow FocusFunc focuses the window being closed.
Now, I couldn't find a way to achieve what I want.
I started to use fvwm with no mouse, and now I need to either
focus with mouse or alt-tab after closing a window.
I am using 2.5.10.

Thanks,
Mikko

Try this:

  *FvwmEvent-FocusNext: Cmd
  *FvwmEvent-FocusNext: destroy_window FuncClosestWindow
 =20
  DestroyFunc FuncClosestWindow
  AddToFunc FuncClosestWindow
  + I Direction C FocusAndWarp
 =20
  DestroyFunc FocusAndWarp
  AddToFunc FocusAndWarp
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow 50p 50p

However, this gives focus to the window closest to the pointer
even if a window is closed that does not have the focus.

Ciao

Dominik ^_^  ^_^

Thank you.
Now it focuses to the window opened before the window being closed 
(regardless on which desk), which is more then I could have hoped for!

Hi,

I'm using fvwm2 version 2.5.9. When I move a window
it's shown during the moving process. In older
versions of fvwm2 only an outline is moved and the
window replaced when the moving process finishes. 

Is there a command to switch between these two ways of
moving windows?

Thanks J

Hi,

I am using fvwm version 2.5.10.

I have an application with a taskbar at the top of the screen. The rest of
the windows OF THE SAME APPLICATION must never cover the taskbar (move,
maximise, resize, ...)

For the moment the application controls all that, but the code has become
really unmaintanable.

I am studying if it all can be done with fvwm config files. I am brand new
at fvwm and window managers. I have read the man page and some of your
answers about EwmhBaseStruts, but I don't know exactly how to apply it all
to my case (and I get lost when reading about Styles, Modules ...)

Can anyone send me a hint? Is there a beginners doc for fvwm?

Thanks in advance,

Walter

Hi all

How could I configure fvwm to start xmms (sound application) without drawing
fvwm window title bar? Xmms have a title bar itself.

Thanks in advance.

Actually, since XMMS likes to do everything by itself, and generally
ignore WM-hints, there is an option within XMMS' preferences to toggle
"use WM-hints" -- you should find this and turn it off, and probably avoid
trying to control this beastly app from within the window manager.

hi - i'm new to fvwm. i have fvwm 2.5.10 and i'm trying to install the themes, but it fails with an error saying i need at least version 2.5.8. (?) 

clutching at straws, i copied the /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.10 directory to /usr/lib/fvwm/2.5.8 and changed the version to 2.5.8 in /usr/bin/fvwm-config, but it still fails. can anyone tell me how to work around this to get the themes installed? thnks.

I understand that you got an error line "You need at least fvwm-2.5.8".
But there is also the second error line (there are 2 cases) that
should explain what is your problem. Post this second error line
if you can't figure what to do.

This is not the correct way to fix the problem. I think you simply have
several fvwm installations and the first fvwm-config in your $PATH is not
from 2.5.10. In this case either uninstall the older version, or follow
the advice from the error message, i.e. supply --with-fvwm-bindir option.

Mikhael.

Is it possible to avoid seeing nautilus in the pager?
I can't find a style for this.

I started using gnome with fvwm. It works nice, but there is one
small problem.

The function InitFunction in my .fvwm isn't started anymore.
It looks like a conflict with the gnome-session.
The splash screen from the gnome-session doesn't dissapear
automaticly.
The function StartFunction works just fine.

I'm using fvwm-gnome (2.5.10-12) and gnome (2.6)
from debian testing.

Please search for "InitFunction" in fvwm man page. This section explains
all special functions and their relationship to a session manager.

If you run gnome-session, then you should start the programs using it. I
don't use gnome-session, but I think if you "Save Session" then the next
time you start gnome-session it runs the same programs, including fvwm.

Mikhael.

Yes, that's true.

The only problem I have now is that the splash screen from the
gnome session doesn't dissapear.

It might not be an fvwm issue.. in the few times that I've used gnome I've
noticed the splash screen staying on until I click on it.

thanks Mikhael. i was only getting the one error message that i mentioned, but i removed fvwm and reinstalled it with pacman (i'm using arch linux), removed the .fvmw2rc file, restarted, and that time it worked. the themes already are in /usr/share/fvwm/themes without having to install anything, it turns out, and to them i just added the extra ones. some of the elements don't work right so i will have to fiddle with it, but at least now i have a good start. thanks again.

I understand that you got an error line "You need at least fvwm-2.5.8".
But there is also the second error line (there are 2 cases) that
should explain what is your problem. Post this second error line
if you can't figure what to do.

You're right it's not a fvwm problem. It's a problem with the
gnome sessions.
I can just disable the splash screen with
'gnome-session-proporties'

Hello!

- sorry for my english -

We want use FVWM instead KDE to improve performance - so far so good.

But there are a performance problem on FVWM.
We have seen this only on a poor java application. ( poor but very 
important ... )

If I change the Desktop - the application will redrawed and this takes a 
while.
A few seconds are necessary to show the complete window item.
(it takes more time than KDE)

If I change only the Page in the Desktop - the application will showed 
very fast.
( better than KDE)
And the +bs option (backing store) works only between the Pages in the 
Desktop.


A easy way to solve the Problem is, to create  only one Desktop and 
seperate this
in 10 Pages.
But a have a Problem - we need a Label for each Workspace (Page).
That is not possible with FvwmPager. FvwmPager provides only Labels for
Desktops.


What can I do?


Thanks!!!!!


Dirk

If this java application is free, then tell its name, maybe someone can
take a look at it.

The pages do not have names, just a pair of numbers. You may try to solve
this problem by disabling desk labels in FvwmPager and adding your own
labels for each page. I.e. create this FvwmButtons layout:

   Label-1 Label-2 Label-3 Label-4 Label-5
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  | Page1 | Page2 | Page3 | Page4 | Page5 |
  +-------+---------------+-------+-------+    <-- FvwmPager with no labels
  | Page6 | Page7 | Page8 | Page9 | Page0 |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   Label-6 Label-7 Label-8 Label-9 Label-0

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks for answer!

###################

The application is a properitary telecomunication network umbrella 
monitoring tool.

There is anything in the FVWM or X core that handles desktops differnet 
to pages.
I see this on some slow applications (old UNIX servers over WAN).
Also, the X backing store option  (/usr/X11R6/bin/X +bs -wm) has only 
effect in an Desktop between pages.

May be, that KDE (I dont like KDE memory waste, but is true) uses only 
pages, to improve
the performance during switching the virtuall workspaces.

I have no problem to change my config from desktops to pages.

(MoveToDesk   --> MoveToPage)
(StartsOnDesk   --> StartsOnPage and so on)

But we need good labels for the workspaces ......


###################

a pager without labels? I agree, but in "man FvwmPager" (2.4.18) is only 
one option showed:

*FvwmPager: ShapeLabels
              Causes the pager to hide the labels of all but the current 
desk.
              This turns off label hilighting.

I need only a flat, simply design, that means in this case 10 Pages in 
one desktop.
This only one desktop is every time the current desk.

fvwm2rc:
DesktopSize 10x1
FvwmPager  0 0


+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|          |          |          |          |
|          |          |          |          |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|own label1|own label2| ..       |..        |..


as substitude for this:

fvwm2rc:
DesktopSize 1x1
"I" FvwmPager  0 9
*FvwmPager: Label 0 "Label1"
*FvwmPager: Label 0 "Label2"

+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|          |          |          |          |
|          |          |          |          |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|Label1    |Label2    | ..       |..        |..



shapelabels create this:

fvwm2rc:
DesktopSize 10x1
"I" FvwmPager  0 0
*FvwmPager: ShapeLabels

+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|          |          |          |          |
|          |          |          |          |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----
|                               Desk 0

(disables only highlighting for Desk 0)

I think it's difficult............

No, very easy! I wrote a mini tutorial on creating FvwmButtons panels a
while ago if you're interested, there are different approaches but this
one describes the way I do it:

http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=162177

I think you're describing something like this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPagerLabels: *
*FvwmPagerLabels: Columns 10
*FvwmPagerLabels: Rows 3
*FvwmPagerLabels: Frame 1
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff0")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff1")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff2")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff3")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff4")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff5")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff6")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff7")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff8")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (1x1, Title "Stuff9")
*FvwmPagerLabels: (10x2, Swallow FvwmPager `FvwmPager 0 0`)

Which looks something like this:

Hi,


Again using CVS, the hints_test indeed shows the right behaviour,
OpenOffice 1.1.2 however does not. If I select (for an oo presentation)
Slide Show -> Slide Show I get only an full screen window, if the
OpenOffice main window is already full-screen (in size). I.e. I have to
resize OpenOffice to 1024x768 in my case and the start the full-screen
mode, otherwise the "full-screen" window is about the same size as the
normal window.

kind regards

Thank You! Yes that is easier than my quick and dirty solution to
set the var label_h =0 in the sourcefile x_pager.c

But how I can let stay the button pressed?
This button should simply show the actual workspace.

The best way is to draw a label in the center of each page, in the 
FvwmPager.
(yes, like KDE .... - my boss and the users want this, and without that 
I can
cancel my FVWM dreams.)

Where in the source can I add this?????

Thanks!


Dirk

That is because there are two basic ways of managing desks in
window managers.  Fvwm and some other window managers unmap
windows when they are not on the active desk.  Backing store can
not work here because there is no mapped window.  Other window
managers (kwm, I guess) create a desktop window that is as big as
the screen for each desktop.  The current desk's window is raised
to the top, and no window is ever unmapped - backing store has a
chance to work.

The root of the problem is that the application takes too long to
redraw.  If possible at all, You should revisit the code and fix
the largest performance leaks. =20

But - with a bit of scripting you can circumvent the problem
within fvwm (2.4.x):

  *FvwmEvent: Cmd
  *FvwmEvent: new_desk NewDeskFunc

  AddToFunc NewDeskFunc
  + i Piperead "if [ $[desk.n] =3D 0 ]; then echo ShowMe; else echo HideMe;=
 fi

  AddToFunc ShowMe
  + I All (appname) ThisWindow (!currentpage) move w+1000 w+1000

  AddToFunc HideMe
  + I All (appname) ThisWindow (currentpage) move w-1000 w-1000

  Style appname Sticky

(replace appname with a pattern that matches all windows of the
application).  Then add FvwmEvent to your StartFunction.  It's
important that the application window is sticky - Otherwise it
will get unmapped when the desk is switched.  whenever you switch
to a desk other than zero, the application is moved to a parking
position 10 pages up and to the left of its current position.
Switching to desk 0 brings it back.

This solution fails if the user unsticks the window, or if a desk
has multiple pages.  The latter problem can be fixed by replacing
the "Thiswindow (...)" call by a PipeRead script.

With 2.5.1 or later, the script can be written in a mor robust
fashion, avoiding the multiple-page problem altogether:

  *FvwmEvent: Cmd
  *FvwmEvent: new_desk NewDeskFunc

  AddToFunc NewDeskFunc
  + i Piperead "if [ $[desk.n] =3D 0 ]; then echo ShowMe; else echo HideMe;=
 fi

  AddToFunc ShowMe
  + I All (*macs*) ThisWindow (State 25) move w-1000 w-1000
  + I All (*macs*) State 25 off

  AddToFunc HideMe=20
  + I All (*macs*) ThisWindow (!State 25) move w+1000 w+1000
  + I All (*macs*) State 25 on

"25" is the number of a user defined bit (0 to 31).  The actual
value is not important, but it must not collide with other bit
numbers in the configuration file.

Ciao

Hi.

When i switch from fvwm 2.2.4 to 2.4.17, the borders of inactive windows  
get an ugly light outline color.
This is demonstrated in the two images

     http://img41.exs.cx/img41/5505/fvwm2-problem--ok-in-22.png   (34 KB)
     http://img41.exs.cx/img41/4519/fvwm2-problem--ko-in-24.png   (34 KB)

which also show the relevant .fvwm2rc-code.

Anyone knows what has happend and how to get rid of the light lines in 2.4?

Thanks for your help.
Romano


P.S.: I love my fvwm2-setup - if anyone is interested i can publish it in  
full.

Apparently, you don't like the results of the new hilite/shadow
calculations.

To gain full control of hilites and shadows, you can use colorsets
and set the hilite and shadow colors explicitly.

Hello list,

>From quite some time I try to make Psi jabber client windows behave like
I want, but Psi is very stubborn ;-)
What I try to get is to show window with new message every time it came,
but not to pass focus to it. So I want that every new message will open a
window (or raise it, if it exist), but this window will not get focused.

There is an option in Psi to open (or raise) window on every new message

Below are the Styles I use:

Style * FPEnterToFocus, !FPLeaveToUnfocus, FPClickToFocus, \
        !FPClickRaisesFocused, FPPassFocusClick, FPFocusByProgram, \
	FPFocusByFunction, !FPFocusByFunctionWarpPointer, \
	FPGrabFocus, FPGrabFocusTransient, FPReleaseFocus, \
	FPReleaseFocusTransient
Style Psi !FPFocusByProgram, !FPFocusByFunction, !FPGrabFocus, \
	!FPGrabFocusTransient, IgnoreRestack, FPEnterToFocus, \
	EWMHIgnoreStateHints, EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints, \
	EWMHIgnoreStrutHints, GNOMEIgnoreHints, 
Style XTerm FPOverrideGrabFocus
Style gvim FPOverrideGrabFocus

The problem is that Psi windows with new message always gets focus. You
can imagine how frustrating this can be, when in the middle of wiritting
you notice that half of the text you've written landed in the message
window and not in the text editor. :-(

The only change I achieved was that message windows wasn't raised but
still get focused. So it's exactly the oposite that I want. :-(

Are there any chance to get the bahaviour I want?
I'm empty of ideas already...

Hi everyone,

Am I missing something or there is no possibility to focus FvwmPager?
The only workaround I found is to swallow FvwmPager into FvwmButtons.
Am I right?

I need it for my panel raising functions on edge hitting.
Here is a (lengthy) sample:

EdgeCommand Top ShowTopPanel
EdgeLeaveCommand Top FocusTopPanel
Module FvwmAuto 100 "Silent TopPanelFunction" "Silent TopPanelLowerFunction"
		
DestroyFunc TopPanelFunction
AddToFunc TopPanelFunction
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 0
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Layer 0 0
+ I Current (Layer 0, ApplicationPanel) Raise
+ I Current (Layer 0, FvwmPager) Raise
+ I Current (Layer 0, ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 6
+ I Current (Layer 0, FvwmPager) Layer 0 6

DestroyFunc TopPanelLowerFunction
AddToFunc TopPanelLowerFunction
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 0
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Layer 0 0

DestroyFunc ShowTopPanel
AddToFunc ShowTopPanel
+ I All (ApplicationPanel) Raise
+ I All (ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 6
+ I All (FvwmPager) Raise
+ I All (FvwmPager) Layer 0 6

DestroyFunc HideTopPanel
AddToFunc HideTopPanel
+ I All (ApplicationPanel) Lower
+ I All (ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 0
+ I All (FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (FvwmPager) Layer 0 0

DestroyFunc ShowAndFocusPanel
AddToFunc ShowAndFocusPanel
+ I All ($0) Layer 0 6
+ I All ($0) Raise
+ I All ($0) Focus
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Lower
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, ApplicationPanel) Layer 0 0
+ I All (Layer 6, !Focused, FvwmPager) Layer 0 0

DestroyFunc SetPanelCoordinants
AddToFunc SetPanelCoordinants
+ I PipeRead 'echo SetEnv $0Left $1'
+ I PipeRead 'echo SetEnv $0Right $(( $1 + $2 ))'

DestroyFunc FocusTopPanel
AddToFunc FocusTopPanel
+ I Next (ApplicationPanel) SetPanelCoordinants Apps $[w.x] $[w.width]
+ I Next (FvwmPager) SetPanelCoordinants Pager $[w.x] $[w.width]
+ I PipeRead ` if (( ( $[pointer.x] > $[AppsLeft] ) && \
		( $[pointer.x] < $[AppsRight] ) )); \
	then echo ShowAndFocusPanel ApplicationPanel; \
	elif (( ( $[pointer.x] > $[PagerLeft] ) && \
		( $[pointer.x] < $[PagerRight] ) )); \
	then echo ShowAndFocusPanel FvwmPager; \
	else echo HideTopPanel; fi `

This works exactly as I want with ApplicationPanel (FvwmButtons panel)
but not with FvwmPager, because it cannot be focused.

As you can see on top of this way-too-long exapmle I use here my update
for fvwm adding EdgeLeaveCommand, working exactly like EdgeCommand, but
is activated by LeaveEvent

But back to the point: do I have to swallow FvwmPager into FvwmButtons,
or there's some simpler way to do what I want?

PS. If any one interested: patch adding EdgeLeaveCommand was send
sometime ago to fvwm-workers list, and I still have it in my private
repository. ;-)

Hello,

I am having fvwm 2.4.3 and enabled autohide for my Taskbar on win95 style.

If my mouse is placed on the last three pixel bottom of the screen, then my
taskbar is coming up and going down continuously. How to solve this?

With Regards,
L. Subbiah

FvwmPager does not want the focus and says so (verify with
FvwmIdent).  To ignore that wish, use

  Style FvwmPager Lenient

I'll get around eximining that patch sooner or later.  Unless
there are no major issues with it, I will commit it.

The Auto... features of FvwmTaskBar are broken beyond repair.  I
suggest you disable both, the AutoHide and AutoStick options, make
the taskbar sticky:

  Style FvwmTaskBar Sticky

FAQ entry 7.17 describes how to get autohiding through FvwmEvent
for any window, not just FvwmTaskBar.  However, you need 2.5.8 or
later for that.

Well, if the application takes focus itself - and it certainly
looks like it does - there is little you can do, except asking the
developers to remove that mis-feature.

Thank you very much. I haven't thought about it ;-)
Many times when I was reading manpage I wondered when this Lenient style
could be useful. Now I know. ;-)

Thanks one more time. This patch is just a rewrite of EdgeCommand, so
should be OK, but I can't guarantee that ;-) Anyway the only lines I
added by myself are variables definitions, every other thing IIRC was
copy-pasted and a little changed, to react on LeaveEvent.
I use fvwm patched with it for about a month and it works good.
