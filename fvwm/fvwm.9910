I'm not completely sure this is a bug in fvwm2, but it's not a problem 
with twm.  I'm trying to make my way through the fvwm2 code (which
badly needs more commenting!), but thought I'd see if anyone else has
seen this as well.

Open an xemacs window.  Now execute "make-frame" to open another frame 
on top of your current one.  Now iconify the top frame by executing
the "Iconify" function while your mouse is inside the window.  (I
bound "Iconify" to mouse button 1 along with alt.)
When the top frame disappears and is iconified, the lower frame should 
automatically get the keyboard focus.  It doesn't.  The keyboard focus 
is still with the window which is now iconified!  Moving the mouse out 
of the window and back in again corrects the problem.

Has anyone else seen this?  Is there some configuration which I'm
missing which corrects it?  (I'd hate to spend a lot of time trying to 
fix a "bug" only to find it's my configuration. :-)  Does anyone have
any pointers on where to look for the problem?

Incidently, if the window below is some other program it gets keyboard 
focus just fine, so it must have something to do with the way fvwm2
handles multiple windows which are all part of the same program.

Any input or hints would be appreciated.

I'm not on this mailing list (yet), so please respond to me
personally.  If there's interest, and if I find the cause of the
problem, I'll mail the list.

Thanks.

Of course it works with ClickToFocus.  This has nothing to do
with focus policy.  Windows with 'NeverFocus' style might
interfere however.

Version 2.2.2.  Focus policy is "sloppyfocus", but "focusfollowsmouse" 
seems to operate the same way.  You must have your mouse inside the
emacs window and position that window on top of the other emacs window 
such that when you iconify the top emacs window, the mouse now appears 
on top of the other emacs window without having moved the mouse.

Actually, I just now saw that while this is a problem with xemacs
version 20.4, it doesn't seem to be a problem with version 19.34.1
running on a solaris system.  It may be an emacs problem.

I have no idea what your problem is. With the current development
code I can't see it. What is your fvwm version and what focus policy
are you using? Possibly this was a bug in some older fvwm version.

Unlikely. Fvwm doesn't care which application started a window.

Fvwm 2.2, Xemacs 20.4 and SloppyFocus works for me on Debian 2.1.

What about when you have two unrelated windows on top of each other, and
you iconify the top one?  Does the bottom one receive focus?

Really?  The documentation I found for "WarpToWindow" just says that it
will put the cursor in the window.  It doesn't say that any focus policy
is implied by this, so I assumed that your current focus policy would
still apply.  Putting the cursor in the window, while using ClickToFocus
policy, should NOT cause focus to change, IMO.

I've never heard of a NeverFocus policy.  Must be a 2.3 thing...

That sounds like it matches my setup completely.  I don't get it.  I
even removed my .emacs file in case I was doing something strange
there and with a vanilla xemacs it still does it.

Oh well...  I give up for now.  Maybe I'll revisit it later.

WarpToWindow does what the docs say. The effect of WarpToWindow does
depend on the focus policy. However, that's not the point. The example
above works regardless of Focus policy because there's a line to give
focus and a line to warp. One will always be extraneous, but it's
guaranteed to work independent of focus policy. I think you must have
not seen the first line.

I've just compiled fvwm2-2.3.8. FvwmTaskBar closing with:

*FvwmTaskBar: Cause of next X Error
   Error: 3 (BadWindow (invalid Window parameter))
   Major opcode of failed request:  10 (UnmapWindow)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  0
   Resource id of failed request:  0x0
 Leaving a core dump now

It happens when I move the mouse pointer near the clock (where usually
envelope is). If I stay away from it - it's OK.
What's wrong ?

Can you please check where the error occured in the coredump?
Type these commands (you may need to specify the path to the
FvwmTaskBar sources with -d <path>):

  # gdb core
  (gdb) where

*sigh* Maybe I'm just on drugs, but I though this should work:

AddToDecor AppDecor
[...]
+       BorderStyle Inactive Solid #d3d3d3
+       BorderStyle Active Solid #575760

However, this does not produce the expected behavior; where I expected the
active window to have solid border-handles in color #575760, and all others
to be #d3d3d3, all seem to be #d3d3d3.

I'm pretty sure I'm doing something wrong...

Hi,

Is there a way to force a window to do a placement of itself
after it has been initially opened.
For example, I would like to do this when I reopen iconified
windows, and maybe even make a keybinding that would force
the window to move to a position where there is an empty
place, like new windows do when I have the following styles
set up:
Style "*" SmartPlacement
Style "*" RandomPlacement

Thanks,
      Staffan

Yes.  The "PlaceAgain" command can help you (new in the 2.3.x
betas).  With the function below you will get the behaviour
you want when you left-click on an icon:

  AddToFunc IconFunc
  + C PlaceAgain
  + C Iconify off
  ...

  Mouse 1 I     A   Function IconFunc

Yep :-) You are using the wrong command.  BorderStyle knows only
the styles 'TiledPixmap' and 'Simple' although it doesn't complain
about the keywords that can be used in TitleStyle and ButtonStyle
commands.

You should use

  AddToDecor AppDecor
  +       BorderStyle Inactive Simple
  +       Style "*" BackColor #d3d3d3
  +       BorderStyle Active Simple
  +       HilightColor <fg> #575760

Where <fg> is the colour you use for the active window titles.

I've just compiled fvwm-2.3.8 with --enable-gnome.
I've then noticed that the gnome control panel, some gnome apps as gmc and some
gtk apps as xmms had now windows titles.
It is quite annoying with gmc and its desktop icons which then have decorations
Up to 31 of august snapshot i didn't notice this behaviour.
Of course, i can add a  :
Style "xmms"     NoTitle
Style "gmc"     NoTitle    etc ...
but it is not convenient at all to have gmc without window title !

Is there any way to solve this problem, i mean having window title for gmc
main window but not for the desktop icons ?

Thanks in advance.

Jerome

Window titles and icon titles have separate control.  You may want:

Style "gmc" NoIconTitle

Or use the Class of the icons:

  Style "gmc-desktop-icon" NoTitle

This works for me on RH6.1.

I'd like to contribute a little patch (see postings about a month ago
re. "StickyIconsAreReallySticky"). 

However, I'm behind a firewall and can't get at the cvs tree. Are there
any indirect access options?

You should check www.fvwm.org; all of your options are listed there.  You

Thanks! It works just great =)

Now that I got to install 2.3.8 I might as well report a couple
of bugs I found:

1. When I do a "Restart WM" all iconified windows disappears on the
screen. This doesn't happen in 2.2.2. Actually the windows are still
there (I can open them by clicking in the WindowList) but they aren't
visible on the screen. FvwmPager sees them though. =)

2. WindowList doesn't show separators between the windows of different
virtual screens any more. I get a long list with all windows that I
have, but I can't see whick ones that are located in which virtual
screen. I run it with: WindowList NoGeometry.

Other than that it seems to work really well.

Btw, I have a question that might not be something that fvwm can change
or not (it might be the X server that is responsible). Does anyone know
if there is a way to make keyboard commands go to the active window
even when the mouse isn't over it? I use the keyboard a lot, and sometimes
it's annoying when I have to move the mouse to do a Shift-insert (to
insert copied text), or F11 (that I've bound to iconify) for example.

Check the man page for the various focus policies, you might find
one you want.

I prefer mousefocus myself.  If your problem is the pointer getting
in the way, track down "unclutter".  It makes the pointer disappear
after some amount of time passes without the pointer moving.

No, that's not what's causing the trouble. I have the focusing set
up as I want (ie clicktofocus), and that works for text and everything
else except for the keyboard commands I have set up. For example
I have F11 set to iconify, and F12 to maximize. They work as long
as the mousepointer is positioned over the window, but when it's not,
I just get "4~" for F12 and "3~" for F11 entered as text. Also shift-
insert also only works when the mouse is positioned over the window.
I believe this might be something that's caused by the X server, not
fvwm, but I just wanted to ask to see if anyone else has a solution.

This is probably only a problem for people not using focusfollowsmouse.
I guess you'll see this both if you use sloppyfocus and clicktofocus.
(when you can type in a window without the mouse being positioned over
it.

A actually just noticed that I can set up
"Key F11 A N Iconify" that makes things work as I want it to do. I had
W(indow) instead of A(nywhere) there before. Now it iconifies the window
that is active. This doesn't solve shift-insert though. Does anyone have
a solution to that one?

There was a complaint that the separators were confusing with the
NoGeometry option so I removed them.

Hello,

shouldn't 

*FvwmWinListAction Click2 MoveToPage,Iconify

deiconify a iconified window on the current page?

It does not for me, f.e. the window deiconifies on page 0 0, if I'm on
page 0 0, it deiconifies on page 0 0, if I'm on page 1 0 and it 
deiconifies on page 1 0, if I'm on page 2 0 .
(Tested with FVWM 2.2.2 on Solaris 2.6)

Is this a bug or am I wrong with the above configuration line?

It's a bug.  MoveToPage fails miserably if the window is on a page
above or left of the current page.  Will be fixed in the next release.

Can you try if this bug persists with a current development
snapshot?  If it does, please describe your setup exactly. What
I need to know is which command your 'Restart WM' issues (there
are several options) and where exactly your icons and the
corresponding windows are placed (desk and page; do the
offending windows reach over the page boundaries?)

Ok.. =)

In that case, I have another suggestion. As I find the geometry stuff
shows me a bit too much information, and the one thing I like about
it is that it shows me which windows that are iconified (and maybe
the desk number that I guess the complaint you talk about was all
about), may I suggest a new option for WindowList.

* When using NoGeometry, you don't know which desktop number each
  of the windows are located on.
* The window number row at the left edge of the menu is not really
  that useful (at least I still haven't found a use for it).
Taking these two things into consideration I would suggest adding
the desktop number at the left side of the first of the items for
each desktop.
Also, placing the parenthesises around the programname instead of
the gemetries, so that they are visible even when you don't want
to see the geometrics.

A drawing:

 ------------------------------- -----------

An alternative would be to have the window number listed to the
left (as it is now):

 --------------------------------- -----------
   Desk 3                          Geometry
 --------------------------------- -----------
 1. 1:Rxvt                         80x24+1+342
 2.   Netscape                     xxxxxxxxxxx
 3.   Rxvt (rincewind.dc.luth.se)  xxxxxxxxxxx
 --------------------------------- -----------
 4. 2:Rxvt                         xxxxxxxxxxx
 5.   Rxvt                         xxxxxxxxxxx
 6.  (Rxvt)                        xxxxxxxxxxx

I have shift-f2 bound to running FvwmIdent, and with sloppyfocus, if i hit
shift-f2, whether I'm over or not over the window, it still pops up info
for the window with focus. FvwmIdent might be diff situation tho since its
a module and probably looks for the window with focus.

Useful when you invoke the menu with the keyboard, with the intent of
jumping to a particular window. (I do this quite often.)

I've now downloaded the latest CVS, and am now running it.
The problem persists. I've also done some testing to see
exactly when it happens.

1. Start X without starting unnecessary programs.
2. Start for example an rxvt and iconify it.
3. Switch to a virtual screen other than 0.
4. Restart windowmanager (I have Restart fvwm2 as a menu choice)
5. Voila. The iconified window is gone. It still shows up in
   WindowList and in FvwmPager though.

How to get the icons to reappear:

Either get them to pop up by using WindowList, or:

1. Switch to virtual screen number 0
2. Restart windowmanager.


As far as I can see, the icons don't disappear as long as I
look at screen 0 when I restart the windowmanager.

I have fvwm set up with eight virtual screens that are all
the size of the physical screen.

Hope this helps, because I have absolutely no idea about where
to start chasing this in the sourcecodes..

This works if you use the 'S' context.  It's a bit cryptic and
completely undocumented.  Took me half an hour digging through
the code :-)  I've added a line in the man page.

Can I recommend "IconsStayInPlace"?

(This is another thread that belongs on fvwm-workers, but I don't
have Benjamiin Low's email address handy.)

Is 'unclutter' a XFree option (can't find it in the docs), or is a new
item in fvwm? If so, what version do I need to get it...sounds like
something I've been looking for for a long time.

I tracked it down via google, and since it was pretty difficult to find a
version that would compile correctly for me (Linux), I thought I'd post
the link I found for others to use:

http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/hppd/hpux/X11/Desktop/unclutter-1.08/

It's neither an XFree86 nor an fvwm option -- it's a standalone program.
And it works like a charm.  :-)

I don't know what 'XFree' is, but you can find unclutter at

I've been using unclutter for years, but on every platform I've run it
on, it seems to run into some sort of condition where it stops removing
the pointer... sometimes right away, sometimes after several hours of
running perfectly.  I have to stop and restart it.

This doesn't have much to do with fvwm, though... unless, dare I
suggest, that fvwm could incorporate this functionality, somehow?  Oohh..

FWIW, I've been running it for years, too, on _many_ different
platforms, and it's never once hung up for me (and I leave my system on
for weeks at a time).

Make sure you're using the latest version, that's about all I can
suggest... :(

Thanks for the pointer. Got 1.08 running...works great.

Now, a question about xearth... I have a line in my fvwm2rc file:

	AddToFunc InitFunction
		"I" Exec exec xearth -grid
		...more things, including unclutter

I've just noticed that after I exit my fvwm session xearth is still
running. If I restart, I get a 2nd (3rd, etc) copy of xearth running.
I'm sure it didn't used to do this.... any idea why it doesn't want to
die. BTW, I tried with the -fork option and it didn't make any
difference.

I just tried it by starting xearth manually from an xterm, and it does
die when exiting fvwm. I'm using 2.2.

The situation described roughly in the Subject line happens in several
situations, most simply in the following situation:

I bring up an FvwmConsole using a menu.
In the console, I type
   ChangeDecor decor-root
where decor-root is a decor that has already been defined
via an AddToDecor command in my .fvwmrc file.
The mouse pointer changes to a large dot,
requesting a window selection for this action,
so I click in that window (no problem there).
But then the expected action, changing the HilightColor,
only happens to a very thin outermost border of the window,
the bulk of the window frame stays in its original color.
However, if I move the mouse pointer into another active window,
then back to the window whose decor had been requested to be changed,
(this is what I meant by "manual intervention")
then the entire window frame switches to the requested color.

What do I have to do programatically to make the ChangeDecor take full effect,
without having to move the mouse around?

I am running Fvwm 2.2.2, compiled on my system, on a Debian 2.1 (slink) system,
running Linux 2.2.12.

Thanks,
Keith

Hi,
	I'd like to use KDE but I'd like to use fvwm2 as the window manager
instead of the default kwm. I tried replacing kwm in the startkde script by
fvwm2. Unfortunately, fvwm2 complains that another window manager is running
and quits. Is there anyway around this ?

First, fvwm is not KDE compliant (whatever this means).  That doesn't
necessarily mean it won't work with KDE, but certain features that the
KDE internal window manager (KWM) provides won't work with KDE (no, I
have no idea what these features could be).  Currently the specifications
for GNOME and KDE compliance are undergoing a complete rewrite, so don't
expect this to change until this rewrite has been finished.

Second, the window manager fvwm complains about is KWM.  I have little
experience with KDE, but I guess there must somewhere be an option
within KDE that allows you to specify your own window manager.  If that
does not help you and nobody else on this list knows what to do you
should ask this question on the KDE mailing list.

You can call a fvwm function that issues a 'RefreshWindow' after the ChangeDecor:

AddToFunc ChangeDecorAndRefresh
+ "I" ChangeDecor decor-root
+ "I" RefreshWindow

This bug is fixed in the current development sources already.

Hi,
	Fvwm2.2 has finally convienced me to switch over from fvwm 1.0.
	But there is one thing really anonys me, and after man
	FvwmPager, I still cannot find any answers.

	In the default settings of FvwmPager, virtual desktops are
	seperated by dotted lines, how do I make them solid? They are
	settings to change for colors, but I cannot seem to find it
	about the lines.

	Thanks in advance.

Shao.

  You have to edit the file 'modules/FvwmPager/x_pager.c', changing the
line containing "LineOnOffDash" to "LineSolid".  Now recompile fvwm and
enjoy.  I do this every time I upgrade because I think it looks better,
too.  I think this should be a config option... if I weren't too busy, I'd
do it myself.

Good luck,
-jason

Sorry, you can't.  The dotted lines are hard coded.

Okay, looks easy enough.  In the next beta (2.3.10) there will be a
'*FvwmPagerSolidSeparators' option.

	Hello.

	I'd like to know if someone got Fvwm to run under NT, for
exemple with Exceed. I know I can run it on the Unix box and
display on the Exceed X server. What I mean is running Fvwm ON NT to
limit local net trafic. Is it a silly question ?

You should check out the cygwin tools (http://sourceware.cygnus.com) ..
It's a complete compiler/fileutils/everything package for NT. It's pretty
cool, comes with bash and gcc and all kinds of cool stuff :)

On the page for cygwin, there is a link to the X11R6 client libraries and
apps (xterm and the like). The clients can connect to any X server, and
lemme tell you it was weird to have bash in an xterm on my linux box with
a prompt in /c//winnt/system32 or something like that :) If you have an X
server running on the NT box (hence Exceed), you could connect to that
instead. 

It'd be interesting to see a window manager compiled with the cygwin tools
:)

Hi,
	I am sure I have missed some docs, so please excuse me now.
	This is not happened to me in fvwm1 days, but...

	I have bound my F10 key to close the window using the following:

	Key F10   A    N    Close

	But after starting one of the icq programs, such as licq or
	gnomeicu, then press F10 to close the xterm, it will kill the
	icq programs as well.

	I have also noticed that, it does not happen with other
	programs, such as running another xterm.

	Is this a icq problem or fvwm2 problem? I am sure this did not
	happen in fvwm1 days....

	Thanks in advance.
Shao.

How do you start your icq programs?  Directly from your xterm?
With nohup?  In the background?  Unless configured otherwise your
shell will send a sighup to all its children in the background
when it's terminated.  You can configure your shell to exit
without doing this.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Gee fellas, I tried this first in my own nave way,
starting an FvwmConsole, typing in it the 'ChangeDecor decor-root' command,
then typing 'RefreshWindow'.
That produced the familiar big dot, so I clicked in the Console window.
And that produced no change at all:
still only the very thin outermost border had changed color.

So then I defined a new function using your recipe above in my .fvwmrc file,
restarted fvwm2, and executed that function in an FvwmConsole,
and got the same result: only the outermost pixels change color,
until I move the mouse out of, then back to, the console.

What's the German equivalent for the American phrase
"back to the drawing boards"?  :-)

Hi,
	Thanks for the reply.

	I fork them to background immediately after start up.

	shao:/home/shao$ licq &
	[1] 8950

	But typing exit in xterm won't kill licq. I will try your
	suggestions.

Cheers,

Shao.

If everything else fails you can issue a 'RecaptureWindow', but
I'm not sure if this command is already in 2.2.x.

Strange.  Does the licq vanish if you kill the shell or the xterm
with 'kill -9'?

	No. It stays with kill -9. I have tried this with both bash and
	zsh. I also tried to run emacs from the xterm, and it has the
	same behaviour. It is nothing really important, but I just want
	to find out why....

That's fvwm's peculiar way of telling the user that a command is unknown.
Well, then only upgrading or a full blown 'Recapture' will help :-/

Hi,
	I don't have the Delete key binded. So I just quickly changed
	the fvwmrc file to have F11 to do that. And Both Delete and
	Destory killed the children.

Sorry, if (in a FvwmConsole) I do:
  ChangeDecor decor-root
  [click in the console to turn the fat dot back into an arrow]
  Recapture
all the windows flicker,
but then the console window loses
the thin outer band of recolored pixels it had,
and goes right back to its original coloration!
In other words, the Recapture wipes out the ChangeDecor entirely :-(

BTW, other than this, fvwm seems to work according to its documentation.

Well hardly being the expert here but all the window managers that I've
tried also do this.  Those including Window Maker, AfterStep, E, TWM,
Olvwm and a few others hardly worth mentioning.  I just use the start from
xterm and exit the xterm which seems to work just fine for me.

And what happens if you use 'Delete' or 'Destroy' instead of 'Close'?
I guess this will happen with 'Destroy' but not with 'Delete'.

It probably depends on your shell and how it behaves when recieving
signals, it might depend on you terminal emulator but I expect they all
behave the same, it won't depend on your window manager.

When your terminal emulator is killed by the window manager it will send
a -HUP signal to the shell it is running. Most shells react to -HUP by
killing all their children (with -HUP so it can propogate) and exiting.
Killing the shell -KILL will just kill it with no chance of it being
able to interfere with its children. Exiting a shell may or may not kill
its children, it depends on the shell and is probably configurable.

You can prevent -HUP from propogating to children with the nohup command
though it tends to create nohup.out files.

Cheers,
Tim.

:-( Then it's upgrade time.  As I mentioned before, this bug is
fixed in the (unstable!) development releases.

You just didn't find the other places where it doesn't - yet :)

Well, it's not a problem of the window manager at all.  Although I may
not have stated this in my previous mails.  The reason why I still try
to find out what's going on is:

 1) Shao mentioned the licq is the only app. with this problem
    (although that doesn't say much).  And he said it doesn't happen
    with fvwm version 1.x

 2) I'm and old shell freak and always willing to learn.

With zsh it's very easy to do this without an output file and
without 'nohup':

  # my_program &!
               ^^

This makes the created process a child of init.  Thus the shell can't
kill it when it exits.  You can do something similar with ksh compatible
syntax:

  # (my_program &)

  I use fvwm2 (on solaris) and there is this program aterm (basically
transparent xterm).

  how do I configure fvwm to diplay aterm with title and all buttons but no
borders whatsoever?

  I tried:

  NoHandles - this makes the window non-transparent (it has the 'tint'
color, root background is not visible)

  NoBorders - no effect

  HandleWidth 2 - this makes borders very thin, but visible

  HandleWidth 0 - again, the transparency is gone (window is 'tint' color)

  while we are at it, how do I display the window without any decoration
whatsoever? i.e. no title, no buttons for resize etc. no borders...

  TIA

  Style ... NoTitle, HandleWidth 0

I've played a bit with aterm 0.3.6 and the transparency seems to be badly
broken.  If the window has a border and is moved the background immediately
gets the border coulour.  There are lots of other strange effects too.
I got the transparent borderless window working withouth a problem though.
I recommend you put the style

  Style aterm HandleWidth 0

in your config file so that the window never gets a border at all.
This should be reported to the aterm developers.

Bye

Dominik ^_^

Hi,

I've been using the same config from fvwm 2.0.46 up through now. The
fvwm2's installed default with RedHat 5.2 and 6.0 both worked fine with
this configuration (RH6.0 used fvwm 2.2). However on RH6.1 (which uses
fvwm 2.2.2) I have a problem when dragging windows out of the pager and
onto my current desk (which as I realized today, is something I do
extremely often ;)

If I grab a window in the pager and start to drag it around within the
pager, it works just fine. As soon as the mouse leaves the pager (while
still dragging) the window does not magically appear at the mouse cursor
for my placement on the current page. It seems that it stays on the page
that it was originally in, however it moves with the movement of my mouse
(as though there isn't any calculation of the geometry or something to
place it on the current page). 

I checked the bug database and didn't see anything like this there. I
haven't been actively reading the list in ages, so I'm sorry if this is a
known bug. Currently, the pager is my favorite and most used feature in
fvwm2, along with the raise-lower toggle which I bind to my win95 key ;) I
would use gnome except enlightenment is slow and has a virtually useless
pager (same goes with KDE). Fvwm kicks total ass!

This is a known bug in 2.2.2.  It is already fixed in the development
sources.

cool! Will there be a 2.2.3 out anytime soon, or should I roll back to
2.2.1 in the mean time (or even 2.2... I REALLY use that feature :)

Other window managers of course ;) I first found the joy of fvwm with
1.23b(?) and have been using it ever since. I've been thrilled to see that
chuck handed off development to a team of people that could handle it and
carry fvwm2 towards a healthy future! I have yet to find another window
manager that works as well as fvwm2, is as fast as fvwm2, and is as damned
flexible as fvwm2. Maybe I should just update my config and make it
prettier. I can't wait till fvwm2 is gnome compliant (having a desktop is
a wonderfully nice thing).

I'm just trying to build 2.2.3, but my c++ compiler doesn't work at the
moment.  Anyway, 2.2.3 will not have this fixed.  We are currently
preparing for the next major release (2.4).  It may take a while though.

I tried the same thing right now, and also noticed a strange behaviour,
though not exactly the same as you get.
When the mousepointer leaves the pager, I get to see the window under
the mousepointer for just an instant, and it disappears.
Similarly to the bug I found in the last beta (though I'm running 2.2.2
here) the window seems to get iconified, but the icon and label is
actually not shown anywhere, but I can get access the window by using
the WindowList.

Anyone else noticing this behaviour?

As I mentioned before, this is *alrady fixed* in the 2.3.x betas.

Does anyone know how this works?  I'm trying to get two lists of
windows: one showing the contents of the current desk and the other
showing the contents of the other desks. I though I could do it with:

*FvwmIconMan*NumManagers 2
*FvwmIconMan*1*Resolution desk
*FvwmIconMan*2*Resolution global

but manager 2 doesn't show anything. I could do it with two separate
FvwmIconMan's but the second one would show all the windows including
those on the current desk.

Cheers,
Tim.

Hi,

I was trying the newest CVS version tonight when I thought I'd
make a patch for the WindowList function so that it works the
way I would like it to do. I've added this as an option
'NoGeometryWithInfo', that does the same thing as 'NoGeometry',
but also shows information about which virtual screen each
window is positioned on, and if the window is iconified or not.

Hi All,

I was wondering if there is a way to add a menu item which could be
selected to turn on and off the sounds played by FvwmEvent.  My reasoning
is simple, sometimes I like to play music and do not want to hear the
other events...  This sounds like it should be feasible, but... I'm using
fvwm2.2.2

Thanks Much,

Tom Gardiner

Seems like you could just "KillModule FvwmEvent" with one menu item, and
restart it with another.

  how come the window behaviour changes depending on whether it has borders
or not? I thought that the border and titles are supplied by window manager
and that the application itself does not (generally) know anything about
these things. it looks like the second part of that assumption is not right,
right?

  I get similar behaviour - transparency works fine with borders, does not
work without borders (either the whole window or parts where there is some
text are no longer transparent).

  anybody knows a good implementation of transparent xterm-clone? (I intend
to use it on solaris).

  TIA

When you installed fvwm, there should have been a file copied to
<install-prefix>/etc/fvwm named "ConfigFvwmDefaults".  The function
is defined in that file and fvwm attempts to read it during startup.

That function is used by the WindowList command.

AFAIK, it *doesn't* work. I asked Brady about this about two years ago
and he indicated that it's something he hadn't counted on. The trouble
is that iconman has to know to which manager a window belongs for
management. That decision is based solely on the show/dontshow lists.
Resolution only comes into play after the show/dontshow lists have
determined what manager owns a window. Only one manager can own a
window.

I finally wrote an unofficial patch to iconman to do this. It ain't
pretty, but it does work, except some problems with followsfocus not
displaying the correct focus at times.

http://www.best.com/~mikehan/iconman.diff

What I ended up doing was enabling iconman to run under aliases and
creating new resolutions, !desk and !page. Bleh. Not the right way to
do it, but I wasn't about to start messing with the right fix, since
it looked like a fairly major overhaul.

I don't suppose you have any ideas? It'd be nice if there were an
official fix to this one.

Wrong.  All your assumptions are right :-)  However, if the application
really wants to, it can find out about the frame and the border
(FvwmButtons is one of these naughty applications).  To answer your
initial question: I don't know.  Aterm seems to be quite buggy since
its behaviour seems to be random.

Try rxvt.  It's implementation of transparency was copied by most
(probably all) terminal emulators that have it.  I spent some time
discussing/debugging that feature with rxvt's authors and it should
work well now (but make sure you have the latest version!).

A few examples:

xloadimage -onroot -quiet <image>
xv -rmode 6 -maxspect -quit <image> # to stretch and keep aspect
xv -rmode 1 -quit <image> # to tile
xv -rmode 6 -quit <image> # to center on default background color
display -size <xsize>x<ysize> -window root <image>

xv and display(in the Imagemagick package) are the most versatile and
can display almost any image format.

Hi,
	When I hit the minimize button in one of the windows, the window
	just disappeared, and I have to retrieved it using the
	mouse(windows list).

	How do I configure my fvwmrc so that, it will put a icon on the
	current virtual desktop.

	Thanks.

Shao.

There's no idiom in German for this, but you could translate
it with "Also nochmal von vorne".

I'd say that's a bug.  Specifying different resolutions for
multiple managers seems to cause all but the first manager
to be empty.

I'd like to create a function that iconifies all windows visible on the
current desktop -- I'll probably tie it to a button. I'm using 2.2.2 -
any help would be appreciated.

thanks

I believe the problem  you are having is  with  a long standing  fvwm2
feature that iconifies windows onto the page that the window is mostly
on.  (Actually, I wasn't aware the fvwm1 didn't do this also.)  If you
keep your windows mostly on screen your icons should stay visible.

It  looks to me like this  is "fixed" in 2.3.5, but  not  in the 2.2.x
series.  The  only way you  could get a "fix" is  by using one  of the
betas or waiting for 2.4.

Look at the All command in the fvwm2 man page:

All (!Sticky) iconify 1

I think you are going to find that the "All" command is only
present in the 2.3.x betas.

I don't know the solution for 2.2.2.

If the application doesn't provide an icon itself you can specify
one in your fvwm config file.  Usually it is done by setting a
default icon for all applications:

  Style * Icon default_icon.xpm

Woo-hoo!  (opportunity for a shameless plug)

I've got a script called "bkgd" which will randomly (or
non-randomly) choose and set a background/wallpaper image.

	http://www.vis.colostate.edu/~scriven/bkgd.php3

Just create a directory "/usr/local/backgrounds" and/or
"$HOME/backgrounds" with your images in it, then run "bkgd" to
set new wallpaper.  I stuck this in my /etc/X11/Xsetup_0 to
make xdm look pretty.

You may also need to edit the options near the top of the
script, to configure various options.

:)

Please only send questions to fvwm@fvwm.org.

Make sure you add "-q" to the "xv" command line, or fvwm will
hang as you describe.

You should be able to find all the commands for fvwm in the fvwm
man page.

If you are running fvwm version 1, in an xterm, type in:

man fvwm

if you are running the only supported version, version 2, type in:

man fvwm2.

Or you can read our version 2 man pages at

http://www.fvwm.org/man-pages.html

  note that xv is not a command of fvwm; it is a separate program that you
can use to display an image in the root window (background). you have to
check the documentation of xv to find out how to use it (if you want to tile
image, maximize the image, center image etc...)

  I got latest version of rxvt and it almost works, i.e. the window is
transparent, even with no border.

  but:

  1) the rxvt window is displayed, everything's OK
  2) another window covers part of rxvt window, still OK
  3) rxvt window gets focus and raises again, the previously covered part is
grey (the border color) when I start typing the background of letters are
grey too. if I move window it gets back to correct transparent state.

  any ideas? does this look like rxvt problem? fvwm problem? X server
problem (I use exceed on win nt)?

Hello,

I'm wondering why SaveUnders was removed from FVWM.  It's there in 1.24r,
but not in the current version.  This is a step backwards, IMHO, because
SaveUnders can sometimes be quite useful, particularly in applications
which have 3D graphics windows which are expensive to redraw.  Because of
the lack of SaveUnders in FVWM, there are two expensive redraw operations
(~1/sec) apeice in my application everytime a dialog is popped up.
neither AfterStep, nor twm suffers from this problem, but FVWM is my WM of
choice.

Please add the SaveUnders code back into FVWM.  It's a simple code change,
and well worth having the ability to do so.

Configuration: RH Linux 5.2, fvwm 2.0.46, XF86 3.3.5.

P.S. Please CC any replies to me, since I'm not on this list.

Regards,
Jon Christopher

While we're on the subject, I'll add that I also miss the other option
that was removed, "BackingStore".  As part of my work, I often find
myself exporting windows to my screen, over a 64K ISDN connection. 
Believe me, backing store makes quite a difference for these apps, even
though they are simple xterms!  They don't request the backing store
themselves, though, so having FVWM do it on their behalf is quite nice! 

I find myself switching back to fvwm 1.24 whenever I need to run these
apps over my ISDN connection, then switching back to fvwm2 when
finished.

Is there some way to add BackingStore back again, especially as a Style
option?  That would be super!  There are some windows I don't want to
enable BackingStore on, and so a Style option for that would be great.

Please forgive me if this is a stupid question as it may be more of a
obvious solution then I can find.

I've done a quick hack on the wmheadlines thing to grap fm, slashdot,
linuxtoday, etc. headlines and place them in my fvwm menu.  Well then
they make menus that fvwm understands and they launch netscape and all.
However I'm unable to get fvwm to read the changed menus using
DynamicPopupAction.

I've looked over and over the man page and I'm sure it looks right.  If
I do a restart it reads it the first time but it never changes if I open
the menu again, and I know that the info has been updated.

Here are the relevent lines from my .fvwm2rc
DestroyMenu Headlines
AddToMenu Headlines Headlines Title
+ "Freshmeat"           Popup Freshmeat
+ "Slashdot"               Popup Slashdot
+ "Linux Today"       Popup LinuxToday

AddToMenu Freshmeat
+ DynamicPopupAction read .freshmeatmenu
AddToMenu Slashdot
+ DynamicPopupAction read .slashdotmenu
AddTomenu LinuxToday
+ DynamicPopupAction read .linuxtodaymenu

Looks right to me from the man page.  Also I've never been able to get
the fvwm_browse_menu.sh to ever work.

And here is the info that the menu has.

DestroyMenu Freshmeat
AddtoMenu Freshmeat "Freshmeat Headlines [10-23-1999, 9:43AM]"  Title
+ "Flight Gear 0.7.1" Exec netscape -remote
openURL\(http://freshmeat.net/news/1999/10/23/94067789
6.html, new-window\)
+ "Heretic for Linux 1.0.1" Exec netscape -remote
openURL\(http://freshmeat.net/news/1999/10/23/94
0677141.html, new-window\)
+ "isapnptools 1.19" Exec netscape -remote
openURL\(http://freshmeat.net/news/1999/10/23/940676918

etc...

	I've not tried this feature, so I really don't know what I'm talking
about (so what's new?), but if I'm reading the man page right, here's
what's wrong.

	The first time you pop it up, you're destroying the DynamicPopupAction
along with the menu; from there on, it will never be executed, and
you'll just keep seeing the same old stuff.

	Try adding the optional "recreate" keyword to your DestroyMenu (in
.freshmeatmenu or whatever) and see if that corrects the problem.
Alternatively, right after the DestroyMenu, you need to add another
DynamicPopupAction command.


Cheers,
Bob

Well as soon as I saw the recreate I said to myself doh.  Seems to make
sense, but sounds kinda kludgy to me so I'll go with my original idea to
read them all if you popup the Headlines menu maybe via a function.

	Well, I haven't looked at the code, so I can't comment on how kludgy it
may be, but I don't see what the problem is with having an option on the
DestroyMenu command that effectively says "destroy only the menu items,
but retain the menu attributes". And (assuming that it works properly) I
can't see anything much easier than changing the script that creates the
.freshmeatmenu, etc., files to insert the line "DestroyMenu Recreate
Freshmeat" instead of simply "DestroyMenu Freshmeat".

	Am I missing something?

Well the problem seems to be that a recreate doesn't do the add the
DynamicPopupAction back into the menu, I've also not looked at the code
but what I think that the recreate option does is saves you from having
to use an addtomenu to make it again, but I could be wrong.  So as a
result we're back to the same thing again.  I suppose kludgy might be
the wrong word to use, how about cluttered?  So if recreate doesn't
recreate the menu with it's previous options such as DynamicPopupAction
as "I" think your saying it does or think is does, then our solutions
are as you said to have the perl script toss that in it, or use some
other way like a function for each one as the man page examples have for
the jpgmenu.  Neither are something IMHO are the best solution so I just
did this:

DestroyMenu Headlines
AddToMenu Headlines Headlines Title
+ DynamicPopupAction Headlines
+ "Freshmeat"       Popup Freshmeat
+ "Slashdot"        Popup Slashdot
+ "Linux Today"     Popup LinuxToday

DestroyFunc Headlines
AddToFunc Headlines
+           "I" Read .freshmeatmenu quiet
+           "I" Read .slashdotmenu  quiet
+           "I" Read .linuxtodaymenu quiet

Which works just dandy I must say and it's cleaner then some of the
other solutions.

BTW if anyone else wants them it's not hard to modify even for someone
like me that knows less then 0% about perl.  Or I can give you mine...

I  assume when   you  mention the   "current version",  you don't mean
2.0.46.  The current non-beta is 2.2.3 and the current beta is 2.3.10.

I'm curious, how do you know SaveUnders is removed?

Somewhere around 2.3.5 SaveUnders was removed as a configuration option,
but I still see code that sets the SaveUnders attribute.

Nither the 2.0.46 version or the current CVS snapshot has SaveUnders.

Because I checked the source.  SaveUnders is not allowed as an option in
the .fvwmrc files any more, nor is it set in add_window.c.

The only place in the current CVS version of FVWM where CWSaveUnder is
used is in builtins.c (turned off) and menus.c (turned on for fvwm menus).

If SaveUnder is good enough to use for FVWM menus, why can't I use it in
my applications?!  Why was the SaveUnder code removed from add_window.c?
Since the WM reparents my windows *without* SaveUnders, nothing I can do
will work around this.  Argh.

Thanks,
Jon

Back in 96 there was some reference to the lack of style flags.
Now, I guess, there is no reason...

	What's strange is that it works just fine for me. All I did was change
the first line of .freshmeatmenu to "DestroyMenu Recreate Freshmeat".
What version of FVWM are you running? - mine was freshly updated from
CVS a couple of days ago. Maybe there was a problem that's since been
fixed, I don't know.

	In any case, if you have another approach that you like better, by all
means go for it!

	[  think  think  think  hmmm...  whirrr...  ]

	One last thought...did you do a Restart after changing your script to
use the Recreate option? Once the menu's been destroyed and rebuilt
without the DynamicPopup action, it's a static menu. It will never again
cause the file to be re-read unless you Restart - or manually redefine
the menu by entering commands through FvwmConsole or something like
that.


Cheers,
Bob

Hello all,

I've been slacking off rather than following the development of my
favorite window manager, and I noticed that a whole lot of betas came out
since 2.2.2.  Do any of you have a general description of the new features
in 2.3.x?  I've been reading through the mailing list archives and can't
find a charter, just a couple of to-do lists. 

Thanks.

Way too many things to describe here,

Doh!

Actually, after searching through several months of the mailing-list
archives I've answered my question in June's section.  I'll also read the
news file and reconstruct what happened per the to-do lists.  

So I kinda answered my own question, but I appreciate the response.

Once again, thanks!  If I find anything out by playing with the new betas
I'll let you guys know.

Hello All!

At first, I'm sorry for my bad English.

I have Fvwm2.3.9 and problem with FvwmEvent.
I want to play wav files with external program - bplay.
I readed man page, but following construction

*FvwmEventCmd Exec /usr/bin/bplay
*FvwmEvent add_window /usr/local/sounds/click.wav

appers error

/bin/sh: /usr/local/sounds/click.wav
Permission denied

But why? I don't understand.
When I uses construction

*FvwmEventCmd Exec
*FvwmEvent add_window /usr/bin/bplay /usr/local/sounds/click.wav

Fvwm is freezed and has no reaction at any events (keyboard or
mouse clicks). I shutdown X Server with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace only.
In this time, ps aux shows running /usr/bin/bplay WITHOUT parameter!
But why? I don't understand.

In this mode, bplay waiting standart input, while Fvwm is freeze.

With best wishes
Victor Vislobokov
Perm, Russia

Hello,
You may try:

*FvwmEvent add_window "exec /usr/bin/bplay /usr/local/sounds/click.wav"

Note the " and exec.
Hope this help, Olivier

Hello,
Seems that there is a missprint in the man page, try:

AddToMenu BrowseMenu 
+ DynamicPopupAction Piperead fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^

Hello Everyone,
  I am trying to make an X shaped vector button style, the best I could
come up with is:

ButtonStyle 2 Vector 11 80x30@1 65x60@0 70x75@1 60x80@0 50x70@0 \
                        20x80@0 40x50@1 30x20@0 50x40@1 70x20@1 \
                        80x30@1 

I was wondering if any one has a better X that you could send to the
list.

Thanks and have a Great night,
sa.

  hey guys,

  I have a very strange problem with fvwm - quite often, after coming back
to work, I find that the fvwm disappeared. there are no borders around the
windows, pager is gone, focusing does not work etc.

  I thought that the fvwm crashed but then I checked 'ps -ef|grep fvwm' and
I saw that all the fvwm processes are running (fvwm itself and few modules).

  my configuration:
    fvwm 2.2.2
    solaris
    exceed (X server under windows NT)

  sometime we have network problems - is it possible for fvwm to stop
working after receiving timeout? or something like that? other applications
work (xterms, netscape etc.)

  any ideas? thanks.

	erik

Since you can get to a shell you can send the USR1 signal to fvwm and it
should restart.

Exceed might have something to do with it. Try turning off any screen
savers or running exceed in full screen mode
(Exceed_menu/tools/configuration/screen_definintion/window_mode =
single).

Cheers,
Tim.

  where did you find this out? it really works, I just tried it, hopefully
it works when the fvwm disappears again.

  I already run exceed in fullscreen mode. and I have to run screensaver (we
have to lock the machine when we go away)

  did anybody experience similar behaviour? is there any known reason for
fvwm to stop manage windows? it happens quite rarely and usually after
weekend.

Try this in your .fvwm2rc

The only source of documentation for fvwm is the man page
(man fvwm2).

I have seen that sort of problem with a similar setup.  Maybe once in
a couple of weeks.  I don't know if fvwm was still running but I'll
try a restart next time.  My config is fvwm 2.1.10, Solaris 2.6,
Exceed 6.0 on NT4 SP3.

I am running FVWM 2.2 on RedHat 6.0. Because of RedHat's changes to the fvwmrc 
scripts, my user file is actually called .fvwm2rc.init and also most of the man 
stuff on fvwm doesn't apply.
I have to say:
exec command
for each thing I want to do in .fvwm2rc.init. Maybe it helps, if you try this, 
or try putting &s after each command like:
command1 &
command2 &
command3
Hopefully, one of them might do the trick...

I am using fvwm 2.2.2 and was wondering if there is a way to control the
alignment of the icon label in the icon box.  Currently it appears that
IconBox only left aligns the labels when not in focus and then centers
when in focus.  I have an annoying commercial application that has
really long icon labels and the distinguishing component of the label is
on the right end of the label.  Is it possible to right align the icon
label?  Currently I have the following setup to get around the problem.

*FvwmIconBoxMaxIconSize 156x0
*FvwmIconBoxFont 5x8
*FvwmIconBoxSetWMIconSize

So I have the IconBox really wide with a small font.  This is a bit hard
on the eyes.  I am able to set the ICON_NAME resource globally for the
application but then I loose the distinguishing label, i.e. all icons
would have the same label.

Thanks,
Brian Servis

Don't know if this helps, but if you use regular icons instead
of FvwmIconBox, and turn off the icon pixmap for this application,
then you should just get a really long icon title with the whole
string shown.

Alternatively you could set up FvwmIconMan with a manager for
just this app, and make that manager really wide.

I'm not a UNIX administrator nor do I claim to have those skills.  I do 
however like FVWM and would like to run it on my NT system at work when 
logged into our Sun network.  However during configure I get an error
    "cannot run test while cross compiling".
I hadn't intended to do any cross compile.  I just unzipped, untarred and 
then typed "configure" and then it errors out with that message,

Can anybody help?

Thanks,
Tom

There's no such thing as an undocumented API when you have the sauce!  I
think it used to be in the man page.  It goes into an endless loop for
me (I have an ExitFunction that starts FvwmBanner) so it should be fixed
before it gets into the man page.

Cheers,

Hi, 

This is my first post here so please bear with me... :)

I have several small problems with setting up my fvwm2 (this is what I prefer
using) -- I seem to be unable to have any icons associated with my xterms and
several other programs. 
I know there should be a default Icon associated with each program I start via
the 
Style "*" Icon xterm.xpm
But this seems not to be the case here.

I have the above in my .fvwm2rc file and I most definitely have the path to the
icons set via IconPath (with or without the trailing '/') and it's still not
working.
It seems to work for RedHat's default fvwm2 configuration (something they call
fvwm-MWM) but I am unable to browse through all the configuration files and
decrypt the procedures they have used myself.
This said I would like to be pointed towards a nice fvwm2 setup guide, since the
man pages seem to be unhelpful when it comes to Button configuration and/or
problems like the above.

I thank you for your cooperation

Regards!

Just out of curiosity.. I've myself noticed a change between the
current development version and 2.2.2. In the latter I've become
used to having iconified windows appear with only the window label
and no icon, but when I installed the CVS version I suddenly had
icons for each iconified window. I hadn't changed anything in
my configuration. (And I don't have any Style lines defining
xpm's, they must be coming from the applications).
How do I get rid of the icons in the CVS version?

I think the following might be of interest to the fvwm group.
It concerns a difference between various wm that caused a bug in the xcircuit 
package.

Dear Ray,
   After bringing up WindowMaker and playing around with your
suggestions and one of my own, I finally came up with a "proper"
solution to the problem.  The correct solution is to have a
separate routine respond to EnterNotify events and change focus
there---I noticed the other day under fvwm (by the way, none of this
focus problem happens under the admittedly simpler twm window manager,
which is what I normally use), while I was using xcalc to figure out
scale values for an architectural drawing, that xcalc was doing
something like that:  whenever I entered the window, it immediately
had keyboard focus.  I didn't get the same effect in xcircuit until
I clicked in the window.  To do that, you need to add, around
xcircuit.c line 1694,

   XtAddEventHandler(top, EnterWindowMask, False,
        	(XtEventHandler)focusinput, NULL);

with a separate subroutine as follows:

/*----------------------------------------------------------------*/

void focusinput(w, clientdata, event)
  Widget w;
  caddr_t clientdata;
  XCrossingEvent *event;
{
   XSetInputFocus(dpy, XtWindow(w), RevertToPointerRoot, CurrentTime);
}

/*----------------------------------------------------------------*/

I ran this version under WindowMaker and the keyboard focus appears
to work right.  I also updated the minor version number and posted
the corrected code to the xcircuit web page.  Thanks for your help
in tracking down the problem.

						Regards,
						Tim

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Dear FVWM-team,

I'm currently using fvwm2. What I exactly want is a window
manager which uses as less memory as possible (fvwm won that competition !)

How to make it use even less memory ?
I want just manager with xpm and GNOME support, I do not want modules,
virtual desktops, buttons, etc. can I save some memory that way ?

Regards, ( )

 Ilia Chipitsine ( )

You don't say what release you are using.  With 2.2.2,
"configure" gives you some choices:

  --disable-modality    disable modal dialogs for applications
  --disable-saveunder    disable saveunders for pop-up menus
  --disable-shape    disable shape extensions
  --disable-activedown-button    disable ActiveDown button state
  --disable-inactive-button    disable Inactive button state
  --disable-mini-icons    disable MiniIcon style option
  --disable-vector-buttons    disable vector button style
  --disable-pixmap-buttons    disable pixmap button style
  --disable-gradient-buttons    disable gradient button style
  --disable-multistyle    disable stacked button styles
  --disable-extended-titlestyle    disable styled title-bars
  --disable-borderstyle    disable BorderStyle command
  --disable-usedecor    disable UseDecor style option
  --disable-windowshade    disable WindowShade function

I can't say how much that will save you.
