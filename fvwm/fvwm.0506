Hello,

  I had a simple problem wich I solved with something very simple: I 
didn't wanted my FvwmButtons toolbar to steal focus from a window in the 
screen since it really doens't use it so I added NeverFocus style to 
FvwmButtons.

  Now I have the following problem but I don't know how to deal it. When 
I switch desktops using the FvwmPager Swallowed by the mentioned Button 
bar, I wanted that any window besides the button bar itself in the 
desktop I choose should be (or get) focused. Using the keyboard to do 
this is no point because I would use ALT+TAB from the beginning; the 
mouse is (obviously) over the bar...

   I do not see that to use for this, so couldn't search very well... :(

   What do you suggest?

Thanks.

I'm not understanding what you're wanting to do.  Can you perhaps
provide a screenshot which shows what you mean?

I think Dedeco wants to change what FvwmPager does
on a button press.

The closest thing I see is the SloppyFocus option
for FvwmPager.
That causes FvwmPager to run this:

FlipFocus NoWarp

Other than that, I don't see where FvwmPager allows
any customization of the command run after a click.

I use this:

*FvwmEvent: new_page 'Current (!CurrentPage) Prev (CurrentPage) Focus NoWarp'

The Current (!CurrentPage) is just to stop focus switching wildly when
dragging the viewport via the pager. (Note, if you dont already use
FvwmEvent you will have to add it to your StartFunction)

Hello All.

I have a problem with a java program that won't listen to reason. And
by reason I mean the position on screen.

I'm using gtk2 apps almost exclusively, and they somehow store their
position after you run them for second time. E.g. if you run gedit for
the first time, maximize its window and then close it, next time you
run gedit it will start exactly where you left it.

Also most gtk2 apps recognize EWMH hints and don't overlap my
gnome-panel at the top.

I have a useful Java program that:

1. starts where it wants every time
2. doesn't know about the -geometry argument or anything similar
3. doesn't give a damn about ewmh (or so it seems)
4. contains two windows, which need to be placed like this:
________________________________________
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|                         |             |
|_________________________|_____________|

... i.e. the first window occupies some 2/3 and the second about 1/3
of the screen to the right. Windows are side by side. Ideally my
self-made FvwmToolbar at the bottom (45 pixels) and the gnome-panel at
the top (24 pixels) should not be overlapped either.

THE QUESTION: How do I achieve such a placement automatically, each
time I start this Java app?

I guess I need to use FvwmEvent to trigger a neat function that will
do the trick.

Any help and pointers in the right direction are appreciated!

Hi,

I'm trying to get fvwm-root to use an image piped to it. I thought if I
used /dev/stdin as the filename it would work. It doesn't. I'm using
this command:

$ convert file.jpg png:/dev/stdout | fvwm-root -r /dev/stdin

This is what I get:
[fvwm-root] failed to load image file '/proc/self/fd/0'

/dev/stdin being a symlink isn't the problem. I checked to see if
fvwm-root decides if the file is a png or xpm by extension or content.
It decides by content (ie I copied file.png to file and tried it).

Is this a bug? Is there a way around it? I guess I could use temporary
files, but that ugly...

TIA

And if you use

    convert file.jpg png:/dev/stdout | fvwm-root -r -

which is the standard way to tell a program STDIN is used.

I've mentioned how to do this several times over at the fvwm-forms.
It's also an entry in the FAQ.  Essentiall you want something like this:

DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-Java: *
*FvwmEvent-Java: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent-Java: add_window SomeFunc

DestroyFunc SomeFunc
AddToFunc SomeFunc
+ I ThisWindow ("some_name") Move 200 +90

AddToFunc StartFunction Module FvwmEvent FvwmEvent-Java

You'll want to play about with the 'SomeFunc' definition, but that
should get you started.

More a feature -- jpgs are not supported for obvious reasons.
Converting them to pngs (which is supported) would be the easiest solution.

I don't think it's a bug.

If you use strace to follow what goes on, Fvwm first checks
to see if the file is an XPM file.  It does that by reading
the first 4K of the file:

open("/dev/stdin", O_RDONLY)            = 4
read(4, "\211PNG\r\n\32\n\0\0\0\rIHDR\0\0\1@\0\0\0\360\10\2\0\0"..., 4096) = 4096
close(4)                                = 0

Since the file is PNG, that fails and it then tries XPM:

open("/dev/stdin", O_RDONLY)            = 4
read(4, "\350\362\201\217\24W\2425_\7 \365T\316rV\267\331\f\30\274"..., 4096) = 4096
close(4)                                = 0

That fails too, since the first 4K of stdin has already been read.
Notice how the input data is different.

The problem is that /dev/stdin is a FIFO, once you read it, you can't
close it and expect to read the same thing again.

If you use convert to change the file to an XPM, fvwm-root HAPPENS to
work, but that's just because right now it tries XPM first.

That's a convention.
A convention that fvwm-root doesn't use.

I don't think such construction may work, programs would need to open
stdin for the second time (appending to already open stdout works well).

  % cat some.jpg | convert jpg:/dev/stdin some.png
  convert: Not a JPEG file: starts with 0x49 0x4a (/dev/stdin) [Illegal seek].

Yes, currently, using temp files would be reliable and portable:

  convert file.jpg /tmp/$$.png && fvwm-root -r /tmp/$$.png; rm -f /tmp/$$.png

I think you may patch fvwm-root to support "-" file argument.

Fvwm would have to copy stdin to a file so that it could be
reread.  Unless the file was an XPM.

You can get Fvwm to try png first:

home> ln -s /dev/stdin /tmp/y.png
home> cat x.png /dev/stdout | fvwm-root -r /tmp/y.png
libpng error: Not a PNG file
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

As you can see, that doesn't help.
An strace reveals libpng trying to do an lseek
and getting Illegal Seek.

Hi,

I tried to add the following note to your fvwm bug-report:

  I've got the exact same problem since I upgraded to Fedora
  Core 4 / mozilla-1.7.6-2.

  I should mention that I've been using fvwm(2) for about 15
  years on different operating systems now, and mozilla since
  it first came out, and until recently I haven't had any such trouble.

  Sometimes, the focus is not entirely lost but is sticking
  to a different window (of mozilla), which is supposed not
  to have focus (according to fvwms coloring of the window border).
  I have to restart fvwm several times a day now because of that
  annoying problem (which may of course be caused by Mozilla, but
  why does a restart of fvwm alone help, then?).

Alas, the bug-reporting system seems to ignore my submission.

Have you found any fix or workaround?

Regards,

Peter Niemayer

Respond to the list please.

The file is opened and closed by the respective libraries.

Fvwm just passes the filename to libxpm, then libxpm opens and reads
the file. If that fails, Fvwm then passes the file to libpng.

The only exception is when the file has an extension, then it passes
the file to the corresponding library first, if that fails, it tries the
other libraries.

In no case does Fvwm read the file and buffer it anywhere.

Sorry, didn't realize the mailing list sets the reply-to to that person.

Okay, maybe when I get some time, I'll download cvs and check it out.

Maybe I should have said I use the SloppyFocus style.
I'll try to clear the idea, but if it doesn't help I'll make a real 
picture of it. :)

Button bar has Sticky and NeverFocus styles.
So. I have a xterm window opened and focused on desktop 1:1. Lets say I 
copied some text from it and want to paste it on a editor window on 
desktop 1:2. I might change to that desktop moving the mouse over the 
FvwmPager inside the Button bar I have. When the cursor reaches the 
Button, the xterm window DOESN'T lose focus since the ButtonBar has the 
NeverFocus style, right?
When the desktop 1:2 is selected and shown with the editor opened no 
window is focused! The situation is: mouse over the Button bar 
(NeverFocus) and the editor window doesn't have the focus. No more 
windows on this desktop.
I wanted that in this situation the editor window had got the fucos.

I hope that is  clearer, folks.

Thanks a lot.

Presumably you mean a transient window?  How do you know that it isn't
supposed to receive the focus?

Which focus policy are you using?

The problem appeared several years ago, and I think it's mozilla
"forgetting" which window has focus.  It often appears when using
tabs, and sometimes closing the offending tab (whichever this may
be) "fixes" the problem.  I spent lots of time debugging this
problem, but never could find anything that fvwm does wrong.
After all, the problem even appears if you leave the focus on the
mozilla window and just switch between tabs.  Fvwm does absolutely
nothing with the focus in this case.

No transient windows. Example situation: I have two Mozilla windows open,
one with the mail interface, and one ordinary browser window. I want to
type text into a form on a web-page, so I click into the text-input field.
The browser window is now highlighted as having focus, and even the cursor
inside the text entry field blinks. But whenever I type something, it
goes to the mail interface window that is not supposed to be active - I
can e.g. scroll the message in the mail display by pressing up/down even
though the browser window is supposed to have focus. This situation is
"sticky" - I can still click into e.g. xterm windows and type there, but
whenever I click into the browser window again, the focus is wrongly
assigned to the mail window. Only restarting fvwm resolves the problem.

While this annoyingly happens several times a day, I've not found a
reliable way to reproduce the situation quickly, which certainly does
not make debugging easier.

> Which focus policy are you using?

Style "*" ClickToFocus

(no exceptions) and (if that matters)...:

Style "*" NoIcon
Style "*" MWMFunctions
Style "*" HintOverride
Style "*" MWMDecor
Style "*" DecorateTransient

Thanks for any hints in advance,

   i use a FvwmButton module to launch some applications, but the 
 cursor does not change to the WAIT style during the execution
 of the applications, i think the default setting should works,
 how come? i tried:
        BusyCursor * True
 not work~~:(
   can i use a double click to invoke the applications? to make 
 it clear, i paste my FvwmButton setting here:
   
Style myButtons     StaysOnBottom, NoTitle, Sticky, WindowListSkip, NeverFocus, Layer 1
DestroyModuleConfig  myButtons: *

This is, AFAICT, not FVWM related, as I have experienced the same with
metacity (Gnome) and IIRC also with wmi. Often changing focus using
alt+tab works here to get a correct focus. I think that Mozilla tries to
keep track of the currently focussed window itself and has some bug
there, as I sometimes even get a bookmark opened in the wrong window,
although it was selected from the bookmark menu.

I have had many many many focus problems with mozilla and firefox.
Sometimes page down will apear to do nothing, yet I later discover
some other opened tab has paged down for no reason.  Opening a link in
a new window using the right click menu loses focus when the new
window goes away; I have to click in the old window to use page
up/down again.  Pasting into the URL field with the middle button
sometimes forgets the focus and I have to click somewhere in the URL
in order to hit ENTER.  Showing a tab while it is still resolving the
name or before anything much has been downloaded (and nothing
displayed) leaves the focus somewhere other than the page itself, and
I have to click somewhere innocuous before page up/down work.

Some are repeatable, most are not.  Mozilla/firefox has terrible focus
problems, whether using it with Redhat, gentoo, or slackware.

That was a good hint.  It led me on a long trail which finally
ended in gtk.
If your copy of Mozilla is built against gtk2, I believe this
patch will fix your problems:

http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=46042&action=view

You may need a gnome account to access that page but I don't
think so.  The patch is about a month old so there may be
a release containing the patch.  I built from source.
I believe it finally fixed a Mozilla focus problem I've been having.

Hello,

I am using fvwm2 ver 2.4.19 in my redhat 9 PC. My requirment is to  
disable to start button in the Taskbar. 

I am able to disable to start menu. But not able to hide or disable the 
button in the taskbar.

Is it possible to do this with fvwm2? Can any one help me?

With Regards,
S. Raja

       *FvwmTaskBar: NoDefaultStartButton
              This option removes the defaults start button if no start button
              configuration options are given. It  is  useful  to  remove  the
              start  button. Note that this is the default if you use the But-
              ton configuration option.
