I have not done anything with strokes yet. But using the
StrokeFunc option I get drawn the stroke (which looks
pretty ugly) I would prefer to get drawn a recangle grid
like when using ResizeOutline. Maybe one could use another
program which starts immediately, draws the outline and is
replaced by the started program after key release.

That's exaclty one of my point. I cannot find a way to bind
something on botton release.

That's close but a bit circumstantial ;-) 

Maybe one can write a new fvwm function which uses the
resizeoutline functionality and start a program on key
release.

Cheers Uwe

In theory one could devise a function where drawing a penguin with libstroke would recompile your kernel.

You guys really should take a good look at the excellent examples of ALL fvwm features and functions that are included with fvwm-themes. If only for educational purposes.

Here's a snippet from the libstroke config...

# The Stroke bindings work as the mouse bindings, but:
# 1. The first argument defines the stroke motion on a telephone grid:
#
#          1   2   3
#
#          4   5   6
#
#          7   8   9
#
#    Or on a numeric pad grid if the sequence starting with 'N'
#
#          7   8   9
#
#          4   5   6
#
#          1   2   3
#
#   We use the numeric pad grid since we have one on our machine.
#   The 0 sequence defines a single click or very small motions.
#
# 2. The second argument is the mouse button for the old way of
#    handling stroke. A 0 is for the StrokeFunc, the new way to use stroke.
#
# We use mostly simple stroke motion. For complex stroke motions we need
# to consider many sloppy stroke motions for each action.
</snip>

The config file then goes on to configure a few dozen functions.

Because fvwm-themes has been designed and developed by actual fvwm developers, it's an extremely useful guide to learning fvwm tips & tricks. Worthy of installing just as a learning tool.

The fact that's it's also the most powerful theme engine I've ever seen or used is merely a bonus.

My 2 cents worth anyway.

Alex

Hello,
    I have this line on my .fvwm2rc to make my root window nice:
+ "I" Exec "fvwm-root" /path/to/image.png

   The image I have isn't the exact ratio of the screen (it is taller) 
and I want it to be shown centered and fully appearing. Currently is is 
stretched to the sides of the screen and top aligned with it (so the 
bottom of it isn't shown). Checking "$man fvwm-root" I found that the 
command doesn't have this option, right? How can I do then?

Thanks in advance,

Dedeco

Hi,
You can use another tool to acomplish that.
I use [1] fbsetbg, which is just a wrapper used by fluxbox to set the
wallpaper, with [2] feh.
I'd recomend that you take a closer look at it :>
+ I Test (init) Exec fbsetbg -l
sets the last used wallpaper.

* you may need to edit the script(fbstebg) to change the path where the
last wallpaper used is stored.

I second Nuno Alexamdre's recommendation of feh for this
purpose.  It works very nicely with fvwm.  In particular,
it handles transparent elements very well.

However I use feh directly, without appeal to fbsetbg or any
another auxiliary program.  In init I have:

+ I Exec feh --bg-scale /path/to/image.png

I first noticed this bug in a key binding to start my web browser.  I  
would make the key strokes and then realize that I wanted to be on a  
different desktop.  The browser takes a second to start, so I would try to  
switch desktops before it was up.  Then FVWM would suddenly crash.

Here's a minimal config:

     DestroyFunc TestFunc
     AddToFunc TestFunc
     + I     Exec sleep 1 ; xterm
     + I     Wait Xterm

     Key     T       A       A       TestFunc

If you hit 'T' then some other key before xterm comes up, FVWM will  
crash.  FVWM doesn't crash if you hit 'T', or if another window is  
focused.  The sleep simulates time the browser takes to start up,  
otherwise it's hard to reproduce with xterm.

I suspect that Wait is causing the trouble, because I have no problems  
without it.

Thanks,

jpkotta

I don't believe that's possible in Fvwm yet.

Hello All.

I've  been  using  FVWM regularly for some time, and wish to thank all
the  developers  for  this  excellent  piece of software! You guys are
great =)

However, I still have several probems with my rather complex config.

One of them is this:

When   I   pop   up   my   WindowList   Menu,   the   icons   of   the
applications/windows   appear  quite  ugly,  specifically,  they  seem
somehow  "shrinked"  by  the  WM,  and so look too small and with some
artifacts. The same applies to FvwmProxy, which uses the same icons.

I did man fvwm but wasn't able to find the answer.

What  is  the  default icon size in the WindowList Menu and FvwmProxy?
How  is  it defined? Currently by the look of it I would say the icons
are  even  smaller than 16 pixels, and what is worse they seem sort of
resized and so look bad. Am I missing smth and can this be changed?

Thanx in advance for any hints!

WBR,
Andrei Popov

Hi,

  I am a newbie on FVWM, I copied some other's config file,
but the child window has no title bar, that is, for example,
I'm using easytag, when I click a icon on toolbar,
a small child window popup, but has no title bar, then
I can't move it.

what kind of configuration dealing with it?

Thank you !

Do man fvwm and take a look at DecorateTransient.

You can also try Style * DecorateTransient

Hi!

I have a problem using SnapAttraction. With this simple config the
problem shows up:

   SnapAttraction 20 Windows Screen

   DestroyFunc MoveM 
   AddToFunc MoveM
   + M Move
   Mouse 1 WSFT M MoveM

When I move a window dragging the title bar (builtin in fvwm or
using a self-defined function) the SnapAttraction works flawlessly,
but when I move it using Alt+Mouse1 it seems to work only the first
time, but no more. Is it something I missed or is it a bug in fvwm?
I use fvwm 2.5.12, Debian packaged version.

Thank you in advance,

David

??

I don't understand why. From the man page:

  "If  during  an interactive move the window or icon comes within
  proximity pixels of another the window or icon, it is moved to
  make the borders adjoin."

Is the move within the MoveM function not interactive? Then why does
it work sometimes? How can I manage that the MoveM command also
snaps?

Greetings,

David

It is not very clear what do you mean by "only the first time", but it
sounds like you describe a regression in 2.5.12 regarding Alt in Move.
This was fixed on 1 Nov 2004 (after 2.5.12). The Alt key should only
disable snap during Move when released and pressed explicitely.

Mikhael.

Ok, I just compiled the latest snapshot and it works as (I had)
expected. With my current version I also tried releasing the alt key
while moving a window and then the snapping works. I think I can
live with it until the next release ;-)

[Section success stories: Actually this was for a colleague of mine
at work. I have managed to switch 3 people from various window
managers to fvwm!]

Greetings,

David

      Hello all.

I used to participate a little in this forum years ago but stopped because
I had so few skills compared to fvwm dev that I couldn't help. But I still
use fvwm
daily on all my machines.

So I have a question : I use fvwm 2.5.6 (didn't succeed to switch to 2.5.12
that
crashes unexpectadly) and switched to Linux Debian Sarge from Woody, kernel
2.6.8
and the Gimp 2.2. When I tear off menus from the Gimp, they are no more
decorated.
More : the menus are pinned and so are said "sticky" by fvwm.

I tried customizatons in the Gimp about "windows to windowsmanagers",got
out ewmh by recompiling fvwm without the support. played with some ewmh
parameters,
all without success. I browsed the FAQs and did some googling with no
chance.
So excuse-me if I was to weird to find obvious answers before disturbing
the list.

I have the DecorateTransient param in my Gimp windows style.

All appears as if this Gimp menus were considered real menus by fvwm. But
I prefer the old way of considering them as usual transient windows that I
can
reduce to only title bar, very confortable with all the menus you need in
the Gimp.

In a previous version of the Gimp, I created a FvwmButton that succeded in
swallowing
the menus but the result is that they are no more independant witch is
unconfortable to
maximize screen usage. How can I get this behaviour back ?


      Fab.

I've got current CVS Fvwm here, and gimp2.1.
The gimp tearoff menus are decorated.
I don't see any special settings in my config file for gimp.

They aren't sticky either.

There are 'ignorehints' settings for Gnome and Ewmh,
no need to compile out the feature.

Use FvwmIdent to verify that your style matches the transient
window for the menu.

I used it to see that fvwm reports them as sticky. The Style
should match the window class "gimp" ou resource "Gimp" as it does
for other Gimp windows because Gimp menus differ only regarding
title and sticky bit, according to FvwmIdent.

Ok I'll recheck that tonight knowing that there is no special
reason to see that behaviour apart from bad configuration :-)

      Thanks for the quick answer.

Finally!

I have always worried about the size of my penis.  When I have sex,
even though she says that the sex is good, I know that what she really
wants is an extra inch!

3 months ago I found The Extender.  I just put it on whilst I'm driving
the car and when I'm sleeping.  It stays hidden under my clothes and it 
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft.

I could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier, but I
thought that when I took it back off I would shrink back to original
size.  I was really surprised!

I have been 4.5" long since adolescence
When I took off The Extender I was measuring 6.5"
After not wearing the extender for a week, I am still 6" long!

The lengthening is permanent!

I could not believe the results of this device.  I am back to wearing it
again and I'm still getting larger!  My girlfriend says it is the best
product I've ever bought, and she ALWAYS reminds me to put it on if I
forget!

Take a peek... We know it works.  There's a total guarantee with it, too.  If
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back.  Every penny.  No-one sends them back!

The Extender correct the curve of the penis too, straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow!

Hello,

I think I have found a reproducible bug. My config is supposed to give
the focus to a window just moving the mouse over it or on its picture
in the Pager (MouseFocus, SloppyFocus, and *FvwmPager: SloppyFocus). I was
wondering why I sometimes lose the focus though the pointer is
over a window...

I succeeded in reproducing it this way : open various windows on the
different pages. Have a window openned on the current page too: let
say an term for instance. Put the mouse cursor on the pager, then take
it quickly to the term, making sure to move over some other windows in
the pager.

This may not work at the first time, but after a few tries, you should
have the focus on some window but not the term. Then you can move as
much as you want over the term, it will not get the focus back until
you click on it, or give the focus to another window and then get back
to the term.

I use fvwm 2.5.12, on Ubuntu. I haven't tried on other systems.

I hope this will help. Sorry if I am not clear enough...

Best regards,

I tried this with Fvwm compiled from current CVS.
I don't get any core dump.  Each time I type T another
window appears.  I can type other characters as that's going on.

Tell us what release you are using.
If you know how to extract a stack trace from the core file
that would help too.

I don't see why not.  All you would have to do is wrap the move command
in a function.  It depends where you select to move the window, of
course.  Let's take for instance the title bar.  You might have a mouse
entry like this:

Mouse 1         SFT     A       FuncFvwmMove

So that your FuncFvwmMove might look something like this:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMove
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMove
+ H Move

All you'd have to do is modify it:

DestroyFunc FuncFvwmMove
AddToFunc   FuncFvwmMove
+ I EdgeResistance 0 0
+ H Move
+ I EdgeResistance 10000 100

Hi.

Most of the time I use a single Alt-TAB to switch between two applications.=
 This can be achieved in FVWM, too, by specifying options CurrentAtEnd, Ico=
nifiedAtEnd for the WindowList command.

However, I could not get used to the re-ordering of the windows in the menu=
 and added a new option for the WindowList command, called WarpToSecond. Ef=
fect is: When the window list is opened with Alt-TAB, then instead of pre-s=
electing the first menu entry (the active window) FVWM pre-selects the seco=
nd one (if present).

Only a few lines of code are necessary to implement that. I have patches fo=
r 2.5.12 available, just contact me.

Regards
Jens

Can perhaps the list be changed to require secret-word-of-the-week to be in
the Subject for non-members to message the list?  The Secret Word would be
clearly listed on fvwm home page.

I would first wonder why you can't just require membership
to submit mail, which should nearly eliminate the problem.

Otherwise, perhaps you just need a quarantine for non-members,
wherein the anonymous mail is moderated.  If the mail is approved,
it reaches the mailing list, perhaps a few hours late, with an
added banner "If you register, this could be delivered much faster".

      Back wit my gimp menus problems. I found it. It was du to fvwm 2.5.6.
After playing a
lot following Dane's advices, I gave up, loaded 2.5.12, recompiled it (the
Debian Sarge package
crashes on my machine), and all is now correct. Thanks for answers, Dane.

      Fab.

Hello, all -

This isn't an official announcement, but myself and Nick Fortune have
been discussing [1] changing the default config file which is currently
shipped with Fvwm.  For many the styles and workings of it are too
archaic for today's more 'modern' tastes.

So we came up with our own proposal, and have been hacking on it since.
There has been some feedback, but it is limiting, and we could ideally
do with more, before we approach fvwm-workers with our proposal.  The
tarball [2] contains the snapshot of 2.5.12 - you'll have to compile it
in the normal way.  I suggest if you try this that you create a new user
and use Xnest to test it, or move your ~/.fvwm directory out of the way
beforehand, as some files may get overwritten.

The installation instructions do not differ.   There is documentation
for the interface, and we hope that a lot of it is intuitive enough such
that it shouldn't require much in the way of explanation about how to
navigate things, etc.

The emphasis of the proposed configuration is that fvwm is all about
doing this Your Way (tm) - there will be people who hate the config file
produced.  In a way, I'm hoping this reaction will spur them on to
change things for themselves.  The config files are documented without
reproducing the manpage in so doing.  Where applicable at the foot of
the document are references to other sources of material which might be
of benefit.

I am/was bit puzzled as to the phrases used in your email & messages
posted in URL[1].

The exchange posted on lair.be is about the user configuration file
for fvwm(1).  Your use of "default config file..." and "tarball [2]
contains the snapshot of 2.5.12", I got the impression that you were
referring to the configure script (which creates the Makefile).

So, if you were indeed referring to the user configuration file, why
is there a need for the "tarball ... contains the snapshot of
2.5.12"?  Does the tarball actually contain fvwm 2.5.12 sources?
Why, if so?  Or, does the tarball contain only the replacement
default user configuration file(s)?

Not quite.  The tarball contains a modified snapshot of fvwm-2.5.12
which contains the configuration files and some internal coding changes
to fvwm itself which reflects the config file.  The reason why we're not
just releasing the config files is that fvwm has to be subtly changed -
to render a menu if no config file is found, etc.  They're sublte, yet
important.

I realise this.  :)  I'll be doing this when we approach fvwm-workers on
a more 'formal' basis, if I can call it that.  For now, I'm just after
feedback.

We just had a meeting where I work trying to decide on a standard window
manager for our desktop users.  We use RHEL WS 3 and 4 on the desktop,
and that obviously ships with Gnome and KDE to use.  However, both of
those wm's are big and fat.  It would be nice to have user-modifiable
options in FVWM without telling them they need to go and edit their
configuration files manually.

Is there any solution for the non-technical FVWM user?

Well, as far as the new default config goes, we're not planning on any 
such tool. One of things we don't want fvwm to lose is the impetus
to go and design your own desktop. We thought a configuration tool
would come to be seen as the only way to configure FVWM, and that
the limitations of the tool taken as limitations in the WM.

That said, it shouldn't be too hard to design one with FvwmScript.
At least, not for a fairly small subset of the possible options.

The trick would be getting optimum option set for the user group.
That's going to be asier for a smallish group with a more or less
common purpose than for a large one. So I think I'd probably still
shy away from including a config tool as an out of the box option.

Or you could consider a custom desktop design for your users. I 
think one of great untapped potententials of FVWM is the prospect
of building your business logic and in house apps directly into the 
computer desktop. Of course, that works better if you have large
numbers of employees all using the applciation set in the same way.

Well, any configuration file will do, although I suspect you might want
to look at fvwm-themes [1].  That provides a configuration framework,
with lots of different styles that the user(s) can change on-the-fly,
mix and match, etc.  No need or knowledge of config files is really
needed.

Hello

I'm using fvwm 2.4.18 and have the following sequence of key's defined
Key Right        A       M      GotoPage +1p +0p
Key Left         A       M      GotoPage -1p +0p
Key Up           A       M      GotoPage +0p -1p
Key Down         A       M      GotoPage +0p +1p

which change virtual pages when i press ALT+Up etc.
Can i define such a sequence also for AltGr ?
If i start xev it says that Alt=Alt_L and AltGr=ISO_Next_Group

Please cc me 'cause i'm not subscribed (at least not from this email 
adress )

Thanks

Bye
Calin

First run xmodmap to see if ISO_Next_Group is already in a mod group. If
it is, you can just use that modifier. If it's not, add the following
line into your .Xmodmap:

add Mod2 = ISO_Next_Group

(Of course you can replace '2' with any number you like. xmodmap tells
you the assigned groups.) Now run "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap" and try if it
works: "Key Right A 2 GotoPage +1p +0p" If it does, make sure that
xmodmap is run when you start X.

I hope to press Alt-Tab, the window will raise before I release Alt.
And I can press tab right along, every window would raise before I
release Alt.
The WindowListFunc is only performed after I release Alt. OT2....

Hi,

I've got a little focus problem with FVWM, which happens the second time I
launch xdvi.  For example, if toto.tex contents "Test\bye" and I do :

(1)$ tex -src-specials toto.tex
(2)$ xdvi -sourceposition "3 toto.tex" toto.dvi &
(3)$ xdvi -sourceposition "3 toto.tex" toto.dvi &

the first time (1), the window is correctly opened, but the following times (2)
it is raised without the focus. What is the origin of this problem ?

I use FVWM 2.5.12-5 and I have got the following lines in my .fvwm2rc :

AddToFunc SelectWindow
 + I Focus
 + I Iconify false
 + I Raise
Style * ClickToFocus

Friendly,

Prakash

Hello,

I've noticed that fvwm crashes on resize whenever xmms is playing.

I'm pretty sure it is the same root problem as posted here:
http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/archive/0501/msg00065.html

But I've gotten more information to perhaps pinpoint the problem.

I've found a way in which the problem, or at least one variant of it,
can be reproduced every time.

1. Play a song with XMMS.
2. Resize the Konqueror window.

Interestingly enough, fvwm doesn't crash unless XMMS is actually playing
the song. I've tried using XMMS with different output plugins and
options, but it always reliably crashes fvwm.

Here an strace excerpt of fvwm's final moments:

It doesn't crash for me.
If you have a gdb stack trace, that might be helpful.

I am running gnome-panel from within fvwm, and recently upgraded to the 
newest version of gnome-panel.  When I maximize windows now, they do not 
fill the screen as they used to, instead only that part of the screen 
not taken by the panel.  The new gnome panel is sending window hints (more 
like commands than hints!) that the old one did not.  How can I override 
this so that windows cover up the panel when they are maximized, or 
otherwise invoked?

thanks--Jim

Look in the man page for GnomeIgnoreHints, and the EWMH flags, like
EMWHIgnoreWorkingArea.

Hi Dan,

thanks for that idea; I did try Style * GNOMEIgnoreHints, to no effect.
As for ewmh, this would require installation of the fvwm-ewmh package?
I am in the midest of trying to repair my system after getting various 
library conflicts from manual installations versus apt-gets of debian 
packages, so if there is a solution within fvwm2 this would be best.

No, you should not need the fvwm-ewmh package, (whatever that is),
if your copy of fvwm is built with ewmh support (it should be)
then the ewmh commands should work.

Note that the maximize command has a argument that tells it to ignore
these hints too.

Thanks Dan, that did the trick:  I added

Style * 	  EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea
Style *           EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea
which solved the problem.

Part of my confusion in understanding your first message is that I was 
referring to the stable fvwm man page,
http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/manpages/stable/fvwm2.php
I didn't realize that this was a feature only of the unstable version.

thanks again, I'm really happy to solve this!  --Jim

Subject: FVWM: mouse binding?
X-Spam-Score: -4.9 (----)
Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list
X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

I want to be able to click any part of a window and have it RaiseLower
the window (using focus-follows mouse mode).  So my first, naive attempt
was the obvious:

Mouse 1                W       A       RaiseLower

But I quickly learned that this breaks cut-n-paste by usurping
the left button.  Similar for the middle button.  The right button
is a little better, but I find that it still usurps an application's
use of the right button (e.g. firefox).

Am I asking fvwm to do something impossible?

Thanks
Fletcher

Not at all.
You have to be using one of the later 2.5.x releases,
(I'm not sure when this was implemented).
Look in the man page for the substring 'clickraise'.

Hi, I want to turn off fvwmbuttons and use WinListDesk. (Is Fwmbuttons
what controls the "norm" icons that end up in, say, an "IconBox"?)
I commented fvwmbuttons out of everything I could find, but when i
restart, there they are. Of course when I hit
settings>app-manager>winlistdesk the buttons turn off and WinListDesk
settings>app-manager>works fine. How do I turn them FvwmButtons off?

I may not be the most qualified to answer as a fvwm newbie. I just 
configured my (SuSE off the shelf) .fvwm2rc to get rid of Fvwmbuttons
commenting out its invocation in the start and restart section.

to have an icon box (actually a pile of icons in the bottom right of the 
screen as I was used to) I added 

Style "*"   IconBox -20 0 -1 -1 , IconFill bottom right   
Style "*"   StickyIcon

Hello

Is it possible to move the window when the mouse button is holded on 
titlebar ?
Just drag the window in other place ...

Everything is possible! Put the following lines into your config file:

# Explanation: [Mouse] button [1] on [T]itlebar with [A]ny modifier
# -> call function [FuncMoveWindow]
Mouse 1 T A FuncMoveWindow

# And the function itself:
# On mouse [M]otion -> [Move] window
DestroyFunc FuncMoveWindow
AddToFunc FuncMoveWindow
+ M Move

That should do the trick. :)

In this case you need to combine many actions in a single function:

Mouse 1 T A FuncMoveOrRaise
Mouse 1 W A Raise

DestroyFunc FuncMoveOrRaise
AddToFunc FuncMoveOrRaise
+ C Raise # C = Click, M = Move, D = double click, H = hold
+ M Move

There's an excellent beginner's guide in
http://www.zensites.net/fvwm/guide/ . I recommend, that covers this
topic well.

Perfect.  All it took is an upgrade to 2.5.12.  Thanks so much!
With 2.5.12 I can't seem to restart any of the modules in my .fvwmrc
when I click "restart fvwm", but that's a different problem.
If I can't figure it out, I'll be back.

Thanks
Fletcher

If you are setting ModulePath in your .fvwm2rc, don't.

Does it break things if we do? What should we do instead
if we have non-distribution modules and can't (or don't want)
to install them in FVWM_MODULEDIR?

Only if you install a new release and the modules are in
a new location.

Append or prepend to the ModulePath:

ModulePath ${HOME}/lib/fvwm/modules:+

Note the colon, plus sign.
