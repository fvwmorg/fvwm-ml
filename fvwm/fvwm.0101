I suggest using a font viewing app to get the font name( e.g. gfontsel or 
xfontsel). then put:

WindowFont "-*-yourtruetype font-*-*-*-*-72-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"

In your fvwm2rc file. If you want to change your menu or icon font see 
the man page, its all there.

You may take a look at FAQ, question 3.18, which describes 2 solutions
for this, one using a special function and one using FvwmEvent.

The following should work in 2.2 (and greater):

  # Alt-F9 iconifies the current window except for FvwmTaskBar & FvwmButtons
  Key F9 A M Current (!FvwmTaskBar) Current (!FvwmButtons) Iconify

In the 2.3+ you can configure FvwmTaskBar to never get focus instead:

  # Alt-F9 iconifies/deiconifies the currently focused window
  Key F9 A M Iconify
  Style FvwmTaskBar NeverFocus

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: list

When using this decor

    AddToDecor Vantive HilightColor white darkblue

the titlebar text is displayed in white as expected, but the title
bar button foregrounds are black, which is very hard to see against
the darkblue background.  Setting the non-highlight frame colors
(using "Style ... Color foreground/background") doesn't seem to
affect the button foregrounds either.

Is there an AddToDecor subcommand (or some other method) to set
the button foreground color, or a way to cause FVWM to use the
titlebar text color for the button foregrounds?

Fvwm calculates a hilight and a shadow colour from the background
colour of the button to create a good 3D look of the button
relief.  The foreground colour is not used at all.

The 2.2.4 releaso does not support customising the button relief
colours (other than by changing the backgorund colour).  The
current beta releases allow to select these colour individually by
using so called colour sets that are managed by the new module
FvwmTheme.  A config for your needs would look something like
this:

  #
  # FvwmTheme
  #
  # This goes to the start of your config file before any other
  # modules are started
  #
  # 0 = Inactive windows
  # 1 = Active windows
  *FvwmThemeColorset 0 fg whatever_colour, bg you_like
  *FvwmThemeColorset 1 fg white, bg darkblue, hi lightblue

  # run FvwmTheme before anything else is done
  ModuleSynchronous Timeout 5 FvwmTheme
  
  Style * Colorset 0
  HilightColorset 1

THe current beta release is 2.3.26, but you don't want it
because it crashes.  I will make the new 2.3.27 release today, so
it should be available on Thursday or Friday on our web site.

Bye

Thank you, Mikhael.
Great advice to use sync. PipeRead in exchange of async. Exec !.

The same can be applied in the menu instruction
for visualizing the last closed window:

> + "last X closed" Exec exec xwud -in $HOME/.lastx.xwd

it doesn't show up immediatly,
which can create confusion in the user.
To avoid it:

+ "last X closed" Exec piperead `xwud -in $HOME/.lastx.xwd >/dev/null`


Have another millenium.

It will work with any ClickTime and not only on "C" if you use synchronous
PipeRead instead of asynchronous Exec:

+ I PipeRead `xwd -silent -id $w -out $HOME/.lastx.xwd >/dev/null`

hi all...

i have a situation where i would like the window manager to prompt the 
user for some text input and then to use that input in subsequent menus 
specified in the .fvwm2rc

for example, lets say that i  want the user to be able to specify the 
color of the foreground of an xterm...
   the user selects 'xterm' from their mouse menu...
   they are then prompted for the foreground color...
   they then get a submenu that allows them to choose from a number of 
different fonts....
   the xterm pops up with the right color and font

is something like this possible?

i'd like to avoid, if at all possible, popping up an xterm to get the 
text input

thanks for any help,
-greg-

Sounds like a job for FvwmScript.

I have such a script that prompts the user for all 20 xterm colours (including
a colour browser), font, auto wrap, scroll, etc., and writes the results to an
X resources file. It's part of the AnotherLevelUp fvwm2 configuration

	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU/

but you could easily modify it to make it `stand alone'. If you get the tar
from the above URL, you'll find it in

	scripts/Xresources_XTerm
and	scripts/ColourNameBrowser

and you will also want

	bin/try-xterm-colours

Either FvwmForm or FvwmScript has the ability to get text from
a user and generate fvwm commands.

I think FvwmForm is a little easier to work with.
FvwmScript has more widgets and is more flexible.

Using either one you could redefine the menus, or you might want
to just create the xterm from the form.

You don't need the window manager to give it to you,
its available to any program.  Try "man XQueryPointer".

What is it you are trying to do?

Here's a small program I wrote many years ago to print out a geometry
spec for the current position.  I might even still use it in shell
scripts though I'm not certain.  I don't know how easy/hard it would
be to make a call to it in .fvwm2rc.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: FVWM: referring to current pointer co-ords

i want to do two things...

the FvwmForm thing works great but i want it to pop the form up right 
under the mouse with the upper left corner being the
current X,Y of the pointer...

i also want to use FvwmEvent to cause newly created windows to pop-up 
with their upper-left corner at the current X,Y of the pointer...

in order to do this i think that i need to be able to tell fvwm that X 
and Y arguments that are used to refer to screen coords should be the 
current X,Y of the mouse

First off, let me say fvwm2 is great -- I've been using it pretty much
since the day it came out, and it's just SOO much better than anything
else imaginable.  A big thanks to everyone who's contributed to fvwm2!!

I'm a developer fortunate enough to have three (!) monitors hooked up
to my machine at work.  I run Exceed and fvwm2 with single screen mode,
so my desktop (not even virtual) is really 3 screens wide.  Smart
placement is generally pretty good, but I'm wondering about two
features:

1. Being able to specify number of monitors and have placement avoid 
putting windows across monitor boundaries.

2. Being able to get SmartPlacement to go down first, then across
instead
of vice versa.

I have looked in FAQ, man, and newsgroups but haven't found anything on
this.  I am a seasoned developer and MORE than willing to do the coding
for this, but I thought I'd check with the fvwm2 community first.

Thanks very much.

I don't think you can do any of this right now.  Of course you
could write a completely new placement algorithm using FvwmEvent
and PipeRead, but that's not worth the effort.

Actually, we currently have a discussion about future placement
algorithms and agree that there will be a lot more flexibility
some day.  Any ideas are very welcome.  On the other hand we are
close to the first anniversary of our feature freeze for the
upcoming 2.4 release :-P and will not make any big changes before.

I recommend you wait for 2.4 first, then report back so we can
discuss all this in detail.  If you really need this before you
can of course hack something into your sources, but you should be
prepared to throw it away because it will probably not match our
(very vague) future plans.

Bye

The 'm' (for 'mouse relative') bit of the Move command does the
trick:

  AddToFunc MyFvwmForm
  + I FvwmForm <options>
  + I Wait <form window name>
  + I Next move m+0 m+0

Simply call 'move m+0 m+0' from FvwmEvent on the new windows.

The 'm' bits in the move command require one of the 2.3.x beta
releases.  This is not in 2.2.4.

In my .fvwm2rc file, I add following statement

Style Netscape* StartsOnPage 1 0, RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
*FvwmButtons(Title Netscape, Icon netscape.xpm, Action 'Exec "Netscape" 
netscape')

but when I click the "Netscape" button, I get the netscape run with 
maxmized window size, covering all other windows. This makes me feel
very inconvenient. How to tell the system a defined window size of
 a specified application(e.g. netscape)

thanks

The 'm' (for 'mouse relative') bit of the Move command does the
trick:

  AddToFunc MyFvwmForm
  + I FvwmForm <options>
  + I Wait <form window name>
  + I Next move m+0 m+0

> i also want to use FvwmEvent to cause newly created windows to pop-up

Simply call 'move m+0 m+0' from FvwmEvent on the new windows.

The 'm' bits in the move command require one of the 2.3.x beta
releases.  This is not in 2.2.4.

I don't think you can do any of this right now.  Of course you
could write a completely new placement algorithm using FvwmEvent
and PipeRead, but that's not worth the effort.

Actually, we currently have a discussion about future placement
algorithms and agree that there will be a lot more flexibility
some day.  Any ideas are very welcome.  On the other hand we are
close to the first anniversary of our feature freeze for the
upcoming 2.4 release :-P and will not make any big changes before.

I recommend you wait for 2.4 first, then report back so we can
discuss all this in detail.  If you really need this before you
can of course hack something into your sources, but you should be
prepared to throw it away because it will probably not match our
(very vague) future plans.

Its a little off topic but you could try putting:

Netscape.Navigator.geometry: =856x600

into your ~/.Xdefaults file. Or mabey look into MaxWindowSize, if you
are running the development version.

For me, Netscape windows "remember" their most recent size.
If you don't like full screen windows, you should resize them
smaller.  The next Netscape window you create should be that smaller size.

My current theme only uses buttons 1,2,3,4.

I tried incorporating some of the other buttons but still only 1,2,3,4
appear.

Any clues ?

Is there some cfg construct that I need to include to add the other
buttons.

Thanks
JL

Please, always post what you've done.

I think whats happening  is for buttons to appear,  you have to assign
actions to  them.  Ie., you need  both "ButtonStyle" and  some kind of
Mouse action assigned to the button.

The 'm' (for 'mouse relative') bit of the Move command does the
trick:

  AddToFunc MyFvwmForm
  + I FvwmForm <options>
  + I Wait <form window name>
  + I Next move m+0 m+0

> i also want to use FvwmEvent to cause newly created windows to pop-up

Simply call 'move m+0 m+0' from FvwmEvent on the new windows.

The 'm' bits in the move command require one of the 2.3.x beta
releases.  This is not in 2.2.4.

I don't think you can do any of this right now.  Of course you
could write a completely new placement algorithm using FvwmEvent
and PipeRead, but that's not worth the effort.

Actually, we currently have a discussion about future placement
algorithms and agree that there will be a lot more flexibility
some day.  Any ideas are very welcome.  On the other hand we are
close to the first anniversary of our feature freeze for the
upcoming 2.4 release :-P and will not make any big changes before.

I recommend you wait for 2.4 first, then report back so we can
discuss all this in detail.  If you really need this before you
can of course hack something into your sources, but you should be
prepared to throw it away because it will probably not match our
(very vague) future plans.

I would like the placement algorithms to be made available when moving
existing windows.  New windows can be made to line up nicely but it
can be a fiddle to exactly move an existing window to a desired
location.  It would be useful to have not only a snap-to on move but
also to be able to click on a window to relocate it to where it would
go if it was destroyed and recreated.

Hello!

I appologize if this question has been asnwered before, but I couldn't find
it in the FAQ nor in the mailing list archives.

I am using FVWM-2.2.4 and would like to have the munus to have fixed width
of Z pixels, regardless of how long the items are. Is it possible to do in
this version or in the beta version?

Thanks in advance!

I am having problems installing fvwm.  i think this is the correct list =
to mail to about this, if it isn't, just tell me.  the configure file =
cannot find output from lex and gives up before it is done.  the exact =
message is "checking for lex output file root . . .  ./configure: lex: =
command not found"
"configure: error: cannot find output from lex; giving up"

Does anyone know what to do? am i missing something simple? i don't =
know.

thanks

Hello,

I am running FVWM version 2.3.27.
I have the following lines in my configuration file:

Style Netscape RaiseTransient, DontStackTransientParent, NoIconTitle
Style "Netscape: Find" GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent
Style "Netscape: Question" GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent
Style "Netscape: Error" GrabFocusTransient, DontStackTransientParent
#Style "Netscape: New Netscape 6" GrabFocusOff
Style "Netscape: New Netscape 6" GrabFocusTransientOff

I think most of you have seen the New Netscape 6 Window that pops up
at <http://home.netscape.com/>. I do not want the window to take the
focus when it appears so I tried giving it the GrabFocusOff and the
GrabFocusTransientOff atributes but they did not work. Here are the
results of FvwmIdent on the New Netscape 6 Window.

Name:		Netscape: New Netscape 6
Icon Name:	Netscape: New Netscape 6
Class:		Netscape
Resource:	Navigator
Transient:	No
Focus Policy:	Passive
  - Input Field:	True
  - WM_TAKE_FOCUS:	Absent

Does anyone know how I can cause the window not to take the focus?

Thanks,

Neil

i would like to open a new xterm and have the mouse pointer placed above
it immediatey. i am currently using a simple exec command triggered from
a menu to open the xterm, with random and smart placement, which is
fine, but i can't figure out how to move the pointer (causing the window
to have focus and be raised)

any help is apreciated.

please cc my email in answers to the list (i am not subscribing)

thanks,

Is there a way to bind the Tab key so that in moves through the WindowList as if
you were hitting the up or down arrows?

Thanks,

Is there some trick to getting FlipFocus to work?  I tried the following to try
to get Alt-Tab to flip between the top two Windows, or more specifically, the
open Window and the top window on the Window list, but couldn't get it to work:

AddToFunc FlipFocus        "I" Lower
+                          "I" FlipFocus

and

AddToFunc FlipFocus        "I" FlipFocus
+                          "I" Raise

But FlipFocus doesn't appear to be doing anything.  Any suggestions?

Glen

Never mind.  I got it to work after I changed the default window behavior to
ClickToFocus:

Key KP_Enter A  M       Prev FlipFocus

The WindowList works as you want in the current beta releases.

/fvwm

... snip ...

       For  Fvwm2,  the  process  is  similar:  first  create   a
       ~/.fvwm2rc file if you don't already have one, by making a
       copy of the /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc file.  Then, add
       a menu definition to it:

etc.

FVWM is a window manager; window manager != screen saver.  There is no
screen saver in FVWM.

Go get xscreensaver or xlockmore or similar; these are screen savers.
But, they are not window managers :).

Personally, I like xscreensaver but YMMV.

Try xlock or xscreensaver.  You can add them to a menu in your
fvwm config file, e.g.

AddToMenu MainMenu
 + I Exec xlock

Is there anyway to get fvwm to always give focus to a new window when 
one pops up due to a command line operation, eg when I run vim.

With my current setting's (focus follows mouse) the new window only 
gets focus if it happens to materialise under the cursor.

What I'm looking for is an orthogonal focus mode like 
'NewWindowAlwaysGetsFocus'.

If you use 2.3 versions, this is done by:

  Style * GrabFocus, GrabFocusTransient

In fact, GrabFocusTransient and in some cases GrabFocus is default,
see the man page.

For a more general solution (not restricted to focus only) of the "I want
this and this when a new window pops up" see FVWM FAQ, question 3.18.
It also provides solutions for 2.2 versions, but 2.3 is more flexible.

Mikhael.

As far as I know, fvwm doesn't have a focus mode like that.
I think you'd have to use FvwmEvent to watch for the "add window"
event and then use WarpToWindow/Focus.

Please see FVWM FAQ, question 3.18, which deals with the "I want this and
this when a new window pops up" problem. The command to warp the pointer
to a window is WarpToWindow, try it with "50 50" or "30p 10p" parameters.

No, this is not possible. Well, there is always a hope. Here is a hack
which I can suggest.

Create trans-1x1.xpm in ~/.fvwm, containing one line:

  /* XPM */static char *trans_1x1_xpm[] = { "1 1 1 1", ". c None", "." }

Now execute these commands:

  SnapAttraction 10 Windows
  Style */trans-1x1.xpm NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, NeverFocus, \
  	Sticky, StaysOnBottom, CirculateSkip, WindowListSkip
  # the following three commands should be in InitFunction
  Exec killall sxpm; sxpm $./trans-1x1.xpm
  Wait */trans-1x1.xpm
  Next (*/trans-1x1.xpm CirculateHit) Move 50 50

The side effect is that now all your windows snap to each other, which may
be not what you want. Other than that works fine for me. Snaps to center.

More general DeleteSnapRectangles/AddSnapRectangle? Shrug.

This window is not transient (5-th line), so the command would be:

  Style "Netscape: New Netscape 6" GrabFocusOff

Just a note, if you use SloppyFocus or MouseFocus focus policies and the
window happens to be under the pointer, it will get a focus regardless of
GrabFocusOff.

Anyway, this line will not work, because the name is changed to "Netscape:
New Netscape 6" later, when the window already was mapped.
The initial name of this window is the same as for other Netscape window.
Something like "Netscape version...". I don't have Netscape 6.

There are also some pearls in http://home.netscape.com/popup.js, which is
called from http://home.netscape.com/, like:

  var ad_percent  = 20;   // Possibility to get the popup (%)

  if (win.focus) win.focus();
  // Netscape 6.0 complains when focusing on newly opend window, saying
  // "uncaught exception". This exception cannot be caught even if
  // it's in try block.
  // This is a known N6 bug, and no workaround is made here.

I don't know what to suggest. If disabling javascript or proxying out ad
links is not an option, can you simply configure other than
http://home.netscape.com/ page as your start page?

Regards,
Mikhael.

I am running 2.3.20, which is the latest version that is ported to FreeBSD.

I want dialogue windows (or any new windows) to get focus and to have an
active pointer in them.  In particular, I want to do this with WordPerfect
so that tab between dialogue buttons and fields without using the mouse.
I don't know how cooperative WordPerfect 8 is with X, but so far I can't
get things to work right with native X applications - so that is my first
goal.

I have tried the examples in the FAQ with no success.  The closest
I have got so far is to get new windows colored like they have focus
and raised, but the pointer doesn't go to the window and if it happens
to be where the window opens, it is in cross-hair form and for example
with xterm I can't type into the window (the little block after the
prompt is in outline form, like the window doesn't have focus, although
it is in the hilight colors).

I gather that I am supposed to do this with FvwmEvent, add_window and
some function defined to do what I want.  But so far, defining that
function with various combinations of Focus, FlipFocus, Raise, and
WarpToWindow has not come up with what I am looking for.  I think I
was able to do this at one time with hints for mouseless operation for
the disabled.  But I lost my configuration with a crash and have been
unable to find the site with that information again.

Can someone tell me very slowly and clearly, like I am as senile as I,
exactly what I have to do?

i am listening too! that's exactly what i tried to figure out today as
well. fvwmevent takes me to the first screen in my setup, this is not
what i want it to.

my goal is to store my mouse in a dark place where it doesn't need to be
touched. keyboard shortcuts for everything, but that focus thing is
still an issue for me.

still, i'm listening with interest.

yours

2.3.20 was in July, the current version is pre-2.3.28.

There are many people, every one with his own wishes about focus policy,
placement policy, usage of keyboard or mouse, circulating policy, window
states like maximizing, iconifying, shading, borders, buttons, bindings
and so on. FVWM lets you to customize most of things, but you should be
ready learn it, it is not hard if you are a unix person.

The best way to learn fvwm commands is to open FvwmConsole and try all
commands that you want (or find in the man page). Try first the simple
ones like Move, Maximize, Exec xterm, Restart. Many commands need a window
context, they are best to be tested with Next or All, like:

  Next (XTerm) Focus
  Next (XTerm) WarpToWindow 50 8p
  All (!FvwmConsole) Iconify

You will find that Focus does not warp the mouse pointer to a window,
i.e. you may type into a newly focused window despite the fact that the
pointer is actually over some other window.
Once you learn how individual commands work, you may create complex
functions consisting from individual commands, say:

  DestroyFunc SelectWindow
  AddToFunc   SelectWindow
  + I Echo Selected window: id=$w, name="$n"
  + I Iconify false
  + I WindowShade false
  + I Focus
  + I WarpToWindow

  Key Tab  A  CM   Prev SelectWindow
  Key Tab  A  SCM  Next SelectWindow

The cross-hair cursor is used when the window is requered for a window
operation like Iconify, Move, Focus, but there is no window context.
This happens if you use FvwmEvent without PassId. I.e. your function
defined as add_window hook is called without a window context, thus
all window commands, like Focus will first require you to choose
a window and press a button or Enter. Hovewer if you use PassId, and
then WindowId $0 WarpToWindow, this will work on a newly added window.

The example in FAQ lists 2.3.19+ as requirement, but it should be 2.3.21+,
sorry for the mistake. If you already use a developement version, I would
suggest to update to 2.3.27 anyway.

This is from FAQ, but edited to work with any 2.3.x (but not 2.2, because
it does not support PassId). Put this to your .fvwm2rc:

#
# Every new window is focused and gets a mouse cursor
#
*FvwmEventCmd
*FvwmEventPassId
*FvwmEvent add_window SelectWindow

AddToFunc StartFunction I FvwmEvent

DestroyFunc SelectWindow
AddToFunc   SelectWindow
+ I WindowId $0 Focus
+ I WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 50 50

There is no enough information to help you. Please specify what are you
trying to do, your fvwm version, what commands you used, and what you got
after opening which apps on which pages. I will help once I know more.

FvwmEvent is powerful when configured propertly, but it seem your goal is
simplier (you don't want to move your mouse pointer) and may be achieved
without it.

  Key Escape  A  M   Prev Focus
  Key Escape  A  SM  Next Focus

  Style * GrabFocus, GrabFocusTransient  # supported only in 2.3

You may add Raise as well (when you switch focus) if you want.

For complex expressions you may use shell/awk/expr/perl. Try in 2.3.19+:

Key P W CM Current (Netscape*) PipeRead `[ $[w.width] -lt 210 ] && echo Close`

Now press Ctrl-Alt-P in any window. Only if you are in a netscape window
and its width is less than 210, the window will be closed. That you want.

Mikhael.

When I open an xterm, I am explicitly specifying Title and name with xterm 
-T host1 -n host1

If I ssh to another host from that xterm, after some seemingly random 
interval, the xterm title and name are changing to the name of the new 
host. Or, worse, sometimes just to "${HOST}" (minus the quotation marks)

What causes this behavior, and HTH can I turn it OFF? If I name a window 
"host1" I want it to stay named "host1" no matter *what* I do inside the 
window.

Is this an fvwm thing or an xterm thing?

thanks for any clues

Xterm is involved, but I suspect it's mostly a shell thing.  There
are some escape sequences which can be sent to an xterm, asking it
to change its window title.  It sounds to me as if your .profile
/ .login / .bashrc / whatever is set up to use one of these escape
sequences to set the xterm title to the name of whatever host you've
logged into.

In principle, a window manager is entitled to ignore such hints
from xterm and/or other apps.  In practice, I don't know of any
way to tell FVWM to do that.

Its an xterm thing.

By printing an escape sequence within the xterm you can change the
title of the xterm.

For example, I use ksh.  I export ENV=$HOME/.kshrc.

In my .kshrc I have:

set -o trackall
set -o ignoreeof
set -o nolog
case $- in
*i*)    #interactive ksh
  function shdr	{		# changes screen title
    print -n '\033]2;'$*'\07'
  }
  function chdir  {		# fancy change directory...
    'cd' $*
    case $TERM in
      *xterm*|ansi|rxvt)
		     #     shdr "$USER @ $SYSID -- $PWD"
		     shdr "$SYSID -- $PWD"
		     PS1="`colorcyan`$sysid`colormagenta`>`colorreset` "
		     ;;
      linux)
		     PS1="`colorcyan`$sysid`coloryellow`>`colorreset` "
		     ;;
		   ;;
    esac
  }
  alias cd=chdir
  ;;
esac

This makes any "cd" change the title of the xterm.
Look for something similar in your setup.

Sounds like an xterm/shell thing to me.

Applications can send control sequences to xterm to change various
things, including the title of the window.

Some users (including me) like to have the hostname and path in the
xterm title.  I have the following in my .cshrc:

if ($TERM == "xterm") then
    #
    # display host and path in the titel bar of xterm-windows
    #
    alias cwdcmd 'echo -n "]2;${HOST}:$cwd]1;${HOST}"'
    cwdcmd
endif

("cwdcmd" is a special alias that is called when tcsh changes the
current directory.)

Search for something similar in your .cshrc/.login/.bashrc/.whatever
file.

Hope this helps,
Rainer

Hello,
I just installed a copy of red-hat  linux 6.2 and trying to familiarize myself with all the neat things the author was talking about.  From gnome I went into trying to configure fvwm.  The only problem is, whenever I log in as root, I am thrown straight into the fvwm instead of the planin old gnome interface.

What did I do wrong and how can I go to my default installation?

Thanks.

Pedro

Hi,
I am quite new to fvwm.
I am trying to ALIGN one .xpm file(logo) to a certain
place (say BOTTOM_RIGHT_CORNER) but not able to set it
correctly.

i tried changing Xresources file ....

Dtlogin*logo.alignment:                
ALIGNMENT_RIGHT
Dtlogin*logo*bitmapFile: /opt/local/images/my.xpm

(inspired by 

Dtlogin*greeting.labelString:       Welcome to MY STRG
Dtlogin*greeting.alignment:         ALIGNMENT_CENTER)

but this is not working,
any pointers?

thanks
Abinash

  it can be the program you are running, for example the vim changes the
title to VIM - filename, mc (midnight commander) also change the title,
it puts the hint there (IIRC it's configurable)

  it most probably is not xterm itself, nor fvwm. It is either in shell
startup files (like other posts suggested) or the program you are
running. Probably.

Ah, are you offering to provide a patch?

At the moment we are too deep into feature freeze, but be prepared
to send a patch after 2.4 is released and I will happily apply it.

I have no idea why.  Can you provide your config file, please?
Which 2.3.x version are you currently using?

No, FvwmIconMan knows nothing about multiple screens.  If it is
started more than once it must be because some part of the config
file is executed twice.

No, please brush your brain a little more. As you see these are actually
the same examples. The syntax colon-space was introduced in 2.3.21 only.
But it should work with 2.3.26 or the current pre-2.3.28. I myself prefer
to use module aliases (the example that is in the FAQ), because this way
I can start and stop independently several FvwmEvent instances, say one
for sound events and one to catch new windows. Module aliases are poorly
documented in the fvwm man page in the "MODULE COMMANDS" section.

So, please put the example from FAQ without leading spaces and restart.
It should work, send me your full config if it does not work for you.
If you have any ModulePath command, remove it, this only breaks things.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Dtlogin runs before fvwm ever starts so this has nothing to do
with fvwm.

My dtlogin man page doesn't say anything about logo alignment, but
if the logo will accept an alignment setting, the XResource file
information would have to be on 1 line, like:

Dtlogin*logo.alignment: ALIGNMENT_RIGHT

You might want to try the newsgroup "comp.unix.cde".

You are asking at the wrong place.  I think you are running fvwm
on top of CDE.  When the login screen appears, fvwm is not even
running - it is a CDE only configuration.  I scanned through my
"Advanced User's and System Administrator's Guide" for CDE but
could not even find the ...alignment resource there.  You should
ask this question at a CDE mailing list or newsgroup (sorry, I
can't tell you where to find one).

Hm, maybe the ALIGNMENT_RIGHT string is not correct.  You could
try to find the correct string in the dtlogin executable (or some
other CDE executable).  With

  $ strings dtlogin | grep -i ALIGNMENT

in the directory with the dtlogin executable should hopefulle
reveal the supported values of the alignment resource (if this
resource is supported at all).  I have no access to CDE anymore so
I can't test this myself.

I think the executable is called dtgreet, not dtlogin.  If you
don't find it there, try

    $ cd /usr/dt/bin
    $ strings * | grep -i ALIGNMENT

I'm using Fvwm 2.2.4 (the stock version that came with RH Linux 7.0), and
currently have 4 panels set up in .fvwm2rc.  I've tried to add in a 5th panel,
but every time I do FvwmButtons won't load when I restart X.  Is there a limit
to 4 panels, or am I doing something wrong?

Our nice Debian maintainer is doing an experimental packaging of 2.3.x
and I'll be trying that out soon and find out if that fvwm version still
has the problem.

Basically, the system fvwm2rc file defined an FvwmPagerGeometry, then
loads the user's configuration hooks which in this case also have
FvwmPagerGeometry settings. So if you have multiple FvwmPagerGeometry
lines sourced the placement part of the geometry is only honoured for
the FIRST instance.

I THINK this might have been a bug in Debian's system fvwm2rc file. It
disappeared on me after a bit of fiddling, but again I'll check it out
with the experimental packages.

in. Arrrgh!

No, there is no limit.  You should watch the console messages of
FvwmButtons.  Probably you will find the reason there.  If not,
look for a core file and send us a stack trace if possible.

Wow, this is a new one.  I never heard of people trying desperately to get
away from fvwm!  The FVWM95 default with redhat is icky...

That said, I really don't know what you've done, but you should look for a
file called .xsession or .Xclients in ~root.  Most default installations
of RH6.2 will throw you in enlightenment as a window manager.  One way
this behavior can be overridden is in the case that one of the above files
exist.

One other point is relevant.  From the gdm interface you can also choose
gnome as a window manager which will also override the default behavior.

Hi, I'm not sure what you mean by panels.  Below Dominik suggested you
look at the console output; for a RH setup I think you want to take a look
at the file ~/.FVWM2-errors which is where all of the error output is
redirected.

I think maybe you should explain just what you are doing rather than our
guessing.  Then maybe we can help you.

(Sorry, I just noticed that I'm assuming that you are using redhat's setup
for fvwm2.  Are you?)

Have you ever seen the fvwm configuration coming with SuSE?  I can
understand well if people avoid it at all cost.  This config comes
from the computer stone age :(

>Hi, I'm not sure what you mean by panels.  

Does this help?  It's from my .fvwm2rc file (but not wrapped):

## Top row of buttons
*FvwmButtons(1x1+0+0, Frame 4, Title "System Menu",  Icon menu.xpm,  Action Menu

When I add in the "Misc Programs" Panel as the last one (even though it's not
last in how it's displayed on the buttons), no matter what I name it FvwmButtons
won't load.  Here is the actual test Panel conf (copied from one that works):

No such beasty.  I found this .AfterStep-errors file, but it's dated Jan 17,
2000.  However, I didn't own this box then, and it was running Win98 at the
time, so it might be what you're referring to.

I'm trying to add in several topic specific panels from the FvwmButtons bar.  It
works with 4 or less panels; I click on one of them, the panel pops up, I click
on the button I want, and we're off!  But when I add in the 5th panel none of
the buttons appear when I restart X.

Yes, just as it came from the CD, with some ~/.fvwm2rc modifications.

Hello,

I have created a bootable linux cd which uses FVWM2 as
the window manager.  When I enable the numlock key
strange behaviors begin to occur.

For instance, if the numlock is turned off, then I can
use the keypad.  If numlock is on, then the keypad
doesn't work.

Also, after numlock is turned on, both mouse buttons
perform the same actions.  When numlock is turned off,
the mouse buttons act normally.

I don't have this problem under RedHat which uses a
different window manager.  Does anyone know how to
make the numlock problem go away?

Thanks,
Paul

>From the FAQ:

5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in your configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine or very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. So do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.
   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.

Hi,
here is problem description ...

my netscape application with multiple instances of
it(say 2-3 or even more nevigator windows or any other
netscape configuration screen), kills all open
instances of it on hitting X button on top bar,
instead of killing only this window.

when i run netscape from command line in background,
same was happening and error code return was : Exit
255

any suggestions on this.

thanks.
Abinash

It sounds as if you may have the X button mapped to Netscape's
"Exit" (Alt-Q) command.  Have you tried changing it to "Close"
(Alt-W) instead?

That means that button is bound to the FVWM "Destroy" function.

If you want it to only close that one window, bind the button to the
"Delete" function instead.  See the fvwm2 man page.

I actually set mine up so that a single click on the button does a
Delete, and a double-click does a Destroy:

  # Delete on click
  # Destroy on double-click
  #
  AddToFunc Delete-Func
  +	"M" Delete
  +	"C" Delete
  +	"D" Destroy

  # Title-bar mouse bindings (any modifier):
  #       Button	Context Modifi 	Function
  Mouse 0		1    	A      	Function Delete-Func

Just like the FAQ says, using FvwmEvent in fvwm-2.2.x does not solve this
problem:

     3) If you have more than one app window, it is not guaranteed
        that the right one will be used.

Solving this problem is only possible in 2.3.x versions, where FvwmEvent
has PassId option, which does exactly what you suggest, by passing the id
of a new window to add_window event function. This id is available as $0.
Sorry, there is no full solution for 2.2.x versions that I can think about.

I suppose this is important, for you at least. Feel free to ask the list.

Mikhael.

Thanks to everyone who replied! THere was indeed an escape sequence, buried 
inside the .login file inside a switch statement...d'oops!

What I'm actually doing here is taking a look at our default dot files that 
are distributed to new users, trying to dig out from several generations of 
accumulated cruft. There's all sorts of weird stuff in here.

(I'm also having to make them compatible with two different generations of 
fvwm installed in two different places....)
thanks Betsy

In theory yes, but unfortunately your FvwmButtons has been
stripped of all debug information.  Could you download the 2.2.4
sources from fvwm.org and built the FvwmButtons executable
manually and try this again?  You should get a proper cor dump.

Okay, I found the problem in the code.  The biggest problem (among
others) was, that the sign of the x/y value of the geometry was
reset for the further geometries, so this

  *FvwmPagerGeometry -0-0
  *FvwmPagerGeometry +20+20

resulted in this final geometry:

  *FvwmPagerGeometry -20-20

Will be fixed in the next beta release.

Are any of you using 2.3.27 with RH7?  I'm thinking about giving it a shot, and
would like your comments.

Thanks!

If you decide to use a beta, you should first go to RH7 Updates and
upgrade glibc to glibc-2.2 or greater, this is needed anyway for RH7.

You may either compile yourself, or get fvwm-2.3.27 rpm for RH6, which may
work for other distributions as well.

The way our rpms are created is that they do not conflict with RH or SuSE
fvwm2-2.2.4 rpm, so you may have both and switch between /usr/X11/bin/fvwm2
(2.2.4) and /usr/bin/fvwm2 (2.3.27). Remove ModulePath if you have any.

If you have problems, it is wise to stay with the stable version, or to
help with beta by investigating and reporting problems to fvwm-workers@.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Something like:

Hi!

I noticed a bug since fvwm 2.3.25:

In combination with "-- flat" "TiledPixmap" doesn't work anymore in
"TitleStyle". Here's an example of my (non working) configuration:

TitleStyle Height 15 LeftJustified ActiveUp (TiledPixmap
/home/tisi/.fvwm/BrushedMetal/titleA.xpm -- left flat) ActiveDown
(TiledPixmap /home/tisi/.fvwm/BrushedMetal/titleA.xpm -- left flat)
Inactive (TiledPixmap /home/tisi/.fvwm/BrushedMetal/titleI.xpm -- left
flat)

I hope you can redirect me to the person who is responsible for that.

Greetings, Kristian (kristian@pro-linux.de)

That was fixed on Jan 12, 2001.  Get a more recent beta.
Tonight's snapshot looks like it will be a good one.

I tried that.  Setting NoIcon does not change things.  I suspect
that it might be because there is an Icon "included" in the
application.  Maybe if I do an IconOverride with a non-existant xpm
file that might work.

Bingo.  That solved the disappearing FvwmButtons problem.  Now I get to bring my
.fvwm2rc file up to date with 2.3.27.

Thanks!

If you are starting from 2.2.x, there is a conversion utility included
in the package.  (It would have removed the ModulePath statement for you.)

Hello,

Are the following possible with fvwm?

1) I would like to bind some actions to key presses but I would like these
   bindings to be activated only when a window with a particular
   resource name receives the focus.

2) I would like the window manager to generate a sequence of synthetic
   key presses so that for example pressing the H key would send the
   string "Hello, World!" to the underlying application. This is useful
   when you have an application that does not have advanced features
   such as command history but nevertheless you ofen type the same
   command in and would like to do it with one key stroke.

Thanks!!!

Neil

Dan,

It didn't.  Is it supposed to be automatic?  Before I installed 2.3.27 I
uninstalled the fvwm2 rpm, then manually removed any fvwm directories that were
left over.  The only file I didn't remove was the .fvwm2rc file, which I renamed
to .fvwm2rc.KEEP.THIS.FILE, to make sure it wasn't deleted when I removed the
2.2.4 rpm.

Is there a way to initiate it from the command prompt or otherwise?

Its not automatic.
After you've installed 2.3.x, you can pull up the documentation
by doing:

man fvwm24_convert

Basically you should do:

mkdir $HOME/.fvwm
fvwm24_convert

It reads $HOME/.fvwm2rc and writes $HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc.

This utility assumes you were previously using 2.2.x and changes
the 2.2.x commands to 2.4.x syntax.

If you aren't starting from 2.2.x, I don't know how useful it will
be to you.  You could just read thru the man page, the man page
describes the changes it will make.

I suppose you have Style * NoIcon if you use FvwmIconBox module.
It is not clear where you would like oclock to go when iconifying.
If you want oclock to be iconified into the root window, you may do:

  Style oclock Icon         # program supplied icon will be used
  Style oclock Icon my.xpm  # your icon will be used

In case you want oclock to go neither to FvwmIconBox, nor to the root,
i.e. you want it to disapear on iconifying (is this what you want?),
I don't know about a good way to do this, but you may try:

  Style oclock NoIconTitle, Icon totally-transparent.xpm

> I am using fvwm2

You may run "fvwm2 -version" to determine a version.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Thanks everyone for your help.  Here is what I have figured out:

Style suggestions later in the file are the ones used.  If you use
IconBox then you have an entry:

############################################################
# Note that icons are shown in the module
#    only if NoIcon command is applied.
Style     "*"  NoIcon

in your .fvwm2rc file.  This comes relatively late in the default
system.fvwm2rc .  Earlier in the file you specify what xpm file you
want used for icons, then this NoIcon does not exactly delete the
earlier icon entries from the environment, it simply tells fvwm2 to
use the IconBox rather than the desktop to hold the icons.  So now I
override this setting for specific apps (namely oclock) by adding a
Style line for oclock AFTER the NoIcon:

############################################################
# Note that icons are shown in the module
#    only if NoIcon command is applied.
Style     "*"  NoIcon

# Put any apps that you do not want to have icons in the IconBox
here 
# with a specific Icon.  They will get an icon on the desktop if you 
# minimize the app.
Style "oclock"      Icon jclock.xpm


I will continue to do this for any apps that I want to run but do
not want in the IconBox.

Thanks again,
Dan

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Just started using 2.3.27 today, and admittedly am fairly new to FVWM, but this
new setup with these new features are an absolute dream!  I was able to get
multiple panels to work without a hitch, customized to programs and commands I
frequently use, one of which is set up for different root window backgrounds I
like to use, so I can quickly change them with a click of the mouse.

I love the Alt-Tab feature that allows me to tab through the Window List.

The Restart feature seems to be working much better also.  I had trouble with it
under 2.2.4, but in 2.3.27 it restarts FVWM with any new modifications I've made
to ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc included, plus it remembers all the apps I had running and
keeps them alive.  I was surprised and very pleased when the kill ring in Xemacs
still had the data after doing a Restart fvwm2, so I could paste the copied text
into Panel modifications I was making after trying out a new configuration.

One thing's for certain: FVWM is definitely a programmers/working man's window
manager.  I can make it fit into what I need it to do, instead of having to
force myself to fit into what other window manager's allow me to do.

Thanks!  And keep up the good work!

Hello,

Sorry to be off-topic somehow, but I want to know if the "list operator" has
some well defined policy against spam mail. (maybe I should have directed this
message to the operator himself)

Is the mail admin from the originating mail warned? Are the sender addresses
checked when a new mail arrives? Or should we should wait and react as a whole
FVWM community against it.

In other words: what should be done against it to keep this good list clean?

Regards.

Yes, the "current" command is what you need.  Try this:

The window manager is not the right place to do this and it can't
do this job properly anyway.  This would seriously mess up event
handling in fvwm.  I don't know if there are applications that
provide this functionality.

Sorry to junk if not interested.

I have just made a new release of AnotherLevelUp (a much improved version of
Red Hat's AnotherLevel Fvwm2 configuration, with persistent user options and
themes).

See:    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jtl/ALU

for tar file or Red Hat rpms.

Recent main new features:
	* option for random theme selection at start up
	* improved componentisation
	* monitoring of error output from programs started via the menu

Thanks, John Latham

Uh, it's pretty simple.  We don't want any.  If you get some, complain to
the people who sent it.  Go to spam.abuse.net for some info.  Complain to
the appropriate people.  Don't complain to the list (it just wastes more
bandwidth) and don't complain to the network admins at my University, like
some people have done.

And FYI, this list sees only a fraction of the spam that is sent to it.  I
filter out a whole lot of it.

You are right. Speed is a most basic concern in initiating and running any
process. However, this should not be an issue when it comes to end it,
since -by definition- we are no more interested in its speed.

A different thing would be its impact on the speed of management of the
rest of the processes-windows:
Do you mean the consumption of bus bandwith would be important?
Keep in mind that -most probably- what the user is looking at that moment
is precisely at the window he-she is closing.

2. A write to disk is the only way to free valuable RAM from data that
-hopefully- will rarely be needed again, so doesn't have to be kept at hand.
At this point we have to make a vote of confidence that the operating
system has optimized disk management, so reads and writes are done without
overall impact.

Using xwd additionally ensures the size of the window will not surpass the
screen ("desktop") size, securely limiting the chunk of data to some 1.5 MB
(for a fullscreen 1024x768x32 window).

3. Popup dialogs do not interfere, as long as they are answered, not closed
(in which case THEY are the last window closed).

Windows that refuse to close are neither a problem:
If they are still there, they obviously don't need to be recovered. :)
Anyway, if you prefer, just replace the title 'last X closed' by the more
correct 'last window ordered to close'.

>

As you correctly pointed out, that is basically impossible (at least without
changing the kernel profoundly).
Although a similar window could be optionally started in the same position
running the same application (like Enlightenment does at restoring a user's
session) there is no need for any "lastX" in order to do that:
it would suffice to just re-invoke that specific application.


In other words: what you really want is the image of its last state,
and only secondarily the option to reinitiate the process.

This one is much better:
--------------- Cogito, ergo sum.  "I think, therefore I am."

It is often easier to code things oneself than going through the mess of
information to see if there is already an application or library that
does the same thing.

I however force myself to use already-made tools. A lot can be learned
in doing so. Additionally, it keeps me from reinventing the wheel.

This led me, for instance, to get knowing fvwm2, a window manager so small
that not even the way of closing a window is written in its code.

No, I am not recommending you to use fvwm2, but just give lastX a try to
see it in action: You can not imagine how spectacular it really is.
After all, think that you have already undergone the worst part:
understanding the instructions.

Useful?
Many would question even wether a window system is.

Thank you for the in-depth analysis.

In other words: what you really want is the image of its last state,
and only secondarily the option to reinitiate the process.

This one is much better:
--------------- Cogito, ergo sum.  "I think, therefore I am."

It is often easier to code things oneself than going through the mess of
information to see if there is already an application or library that
does the same thing.

I however force myself to use already-made tools. A lot can be learned
in doing so. Additionally, it keeps me from reinventing the wheel.

This led me, for instance, to get knowing fvwm2, a window manager so small
that not even the way of closing a window is written in its code.

No, I am not recommending you to use fvwm2, but just give lastX a try to
see it in action: You can not imagine how spectacular it really is.
After all, think that you have already undergone the worst part:
understanding the instructions.

Useful?
Many would question even wether a window system is.

Thank you for the in-depth analysis.

Juanjo.

Hello list.  I have looked for the answer to my question in the archives,
faq, etc, but didn't find anything.

I have a menu that I generate with FvwmPipe to read a list of servers.  As
it turns out, this list is too long and takes up the entire screen (length
wise, anyway).  Is there any way to make a long menu like that wrap around,
ala win9x.  If not, is there any way to limit the number of entries that are
displayed before the "more..." automatic submenu appears.

Thanks.

What version of Fvwm? It's a builtin feature in the 2.3 betas, meaning
when 2.4 (coming Real Soon Now...) is released, you'll have it.

A double negative is a no-no.

The button styles are global and apply to all windows.  To get
what you want you need any 2.3.x beta release.  Try this:

ButtonStyle 3 - MWMDecorShade
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp <first normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveUp <second normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown <first normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ActiveDown <second normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 Inactive <first normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 Inactive <second normal vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp <first reverse vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveUp <second reverse vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown <first reverse vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledActiveDown <second reverse vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledInactive <first reverse vector>
AddButtonStyle 3 ToggledInactive <second reverse vector>

Oh, I'm on 2.2.4, so I guess I will check it out sometime.
How stable are the betas?

No. This will probably be one of the first things I do after 2.4
is released, though.

Wow, didn't even think that this was an option-to-be.  I just thought it was
an interesting mistake.
Thanks.

No, that's not correct.  You can't control continuation menus in
any way (other by choosing a different font or using more or less
items).

Currently the betas are stabilising rapidly.  We didn't have
crashes for a while now although there are minor problems with
icons, placement, and other things.  The 2.3.28 beta that will be
released will have little known bugs worth mentioning.  This may
change again as we head for the 2.4 release in the next weeks.

Yeah, I misread the question. I thought he was talking about basic
continuations, which maybe were introduced in 2.2.

Hi,
It seems that the built-in Alt+Tab function doesn't 
work for me. Should I add statements  such as
"Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort" in my
.fvwm2rc file? After I install the fvwm2.3.27, I delete
the statesments related with the binding of alt+tab functions.

Thanks

I added the following to ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc:

Key Tab   A     M       WindowList

This will bring up the window list when you hit Alt-Tab.  The folks at FVWM
added in an extra feature so that when you keep the Alt key held down you can
then tab to other windows on the list, and upon releasing the Alt key, that
window is raised to the top and focused.

On 2.2.4 the above would bring up the WindowList, but when you released the Alt
key the WindowList remained in view, and you had to use the up or down arrow to
move to and raise-focus a different program.  This was certainly workable, but I
prefer the new way.

Is there a HOW-TO somewhere that explains the basics of writing your own module
for FVWM?

For example, I have a directory of backgrounds that I like to add in new
graphics for the root window (and eventually do the same for icons).  I
currently have a subpanel that lists most of these graphics, but I have to hand
enter them into .fvwm2rc.  I'm looking for a tutorial that would explain the
basics of what information I would have to pipe into fvwm when the module loads
that would allow a perl program I'd write to read all the files in the
backgrounds directory, format the information, and then send it to fvwm.

Thanks,

Glen

Hello,
    The man page tells how make a function to read a directory of jpg's 
and place them in a menu (search for JpgMenu), I modified it a bit so 
that when I start fvwm2 i get the same picture i last set, hopefully 
this helps you...

# Build a menu of pictures.
AddToMenu PixMenu
+ DynamicPopupAction Function MakePixMenu

AddToFunc MakePixMenu
+ I DestroyMenu recreate PixMenu
+ I AddToMenu PixMenu Pictures Title
+ I PipeRead 'for i in ~/pix/*.*;do echo AddToMenu PixMenu "`basename $i`" \
        Exec "Esetroot -s $i && echo $i > $HOME/.fvwm/desktop_picture"; done'

AddToFunc   InitFunction
+ I Exec    Esetroot -s `cat $HOME/.fvwm/desktop_picture`

I found that a few minutes after I posted the letter, but your method is better
because it allows you to pull up the last loaded image on [re]start.

I got really really procrast-- I mean, bored, and fooled around with 
FvwmTheme for a while.  This particular scheme is borrowing heavily from 
the Enlightenment theme AbsoluteE (the blue version) and makes heavy 
use of the stretching pixmap feature of FvwmTheme.  The background is 
Tigert's Blue Space, the GKrellM theme is something obscure called 3051.

Here's also a screenshot of a mockup of Gnutopia, a rather cheery
BlackBox theme, with the large pager retracted (another thing I fooled
around with.  Actually, all the buttons retract, just for the heck of it).
Cheery happy yellowy and all that.

Hi there!

I am trying to mount my CD-Drive and popup an Xterm-Window with the
content of /cdrom afterwards. Now I found out, that one line in a
function doesn't wait for the previous line to be completed. This is a
problem, for mounting takes some time. Here's my example code:

AddToFunc MountCdromFunc
+       I       Exec mount /cdrom ; sleep 2
+       I       Function OpendirFunc /cdrom =


AddToFunc OpendirFunc
+       I       Exec cd $0 ; aterm -tr -sh 30 -bg black -fg white -ls

This mounts the CD-Rom and opens a terminal window in /cdrom, but i have
to do cd ..; cd /cdrom in that window again, cos the content of it was
not there when the terminal window opened.

Is there any way to wait for "mount" to  be finished? I guess it would
work, if "Function OpendirFunc" and "Exec" would be in one line, but I
don't know a way to have a Function call after an Exec, except having it
on a separate line.

thank you

I think you might be looking for the PipeRead command.  This will cause
the function to wait for the return of the mount call.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu

Hello all-

First of all I am using:

FVWM version 2.3.27 compiled on Jan  7 2001 at 17:22:21
with support for: ReadLine, RPlay, Stroke, XPM, GNOME WM hints, SM

I'm seeing the following problem- I create new xemacs frames using
gnuclient. The problem is that no matter what desk I'm on, the new
frames always appear on the initial desk (0 in this case) that xemacs
was created on.

No problem, I thought, I'll just use FvwmEvent to move them to the
current desktop. So I added the following to my .fvwm2rc:

--cut--
Style "emacs*"		SkipMapping

AddToFunc AddWindowFunc	
# Move emacs windows to current desk as they tend to appear on the
# original desk
+ "I" WindowId $0 ("emacs") MoveToDesk 0 $d

*FvwmEventPassId
*FvwmEvent add_window AddWindowFunc
--end cut--

Except this doesn't work. $d apparently resolves to Desk 0, where the
xemacs frame is created and not the desk I'm currently on. I checked
that FvwmEvent is working by replacing '$d' with '1' and sure enough
xemacs frames were then moved to desk 1 after creation so this seems
to be a $d problem.

Am I misusing or misunderstanding $d? Or any suggestions for other
solutions to my problem?

Thanks,

Von

Doesn't seem to make any difference in behavior.

Ok, add:

Style "emacs*" ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

that seemed to work for me.  I actually used:

Style "*macs*" StartsOnPage 0    0 1, SkipMapping
Style "*macs*" NoPPosition
Style "*macs*" ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

i'm wondering how well fvwm can deal with multiple screens.

i recently scored a second head for my sun workstation at work, so
that when i log in, fvwm is now managing two screens on a single
display.

right now the only "connection" between the screens is that my mouse
will move seamlessly from one to the other -- but each screen appears
to have a separate window manager running it.  can i do better than
this?  

of course, i'd love to be able to drag things from one screen to the
other, but i'd be equally happy with a shared set of virtual desktops,
and i'd even be thrilled with simply having a means of shifting focus
from one screen to the other via a keystroke (rather than exclusively
with the mouse).  (since one of the reasons i chose fvwm in the first
place was the next/prev window ring capability.)

many thanks in advance (and in arrears, for all the hard work that's
gone into this thing!)

Right now, at work, we run Solaris 2.6 and fvwm on our multi-head desktops 
and use software called "x-big-x" which makes the two screens act as one 
large virtual screen. You can drag between windows, etc. Their URL is 
www.x-software.com . We use this in our NOC to control the BIG screens. 
This software is produced by (literally) two guys in a garage in Germany 
and while it works perfectly, there are some organizational reasons why 
we're moving away from it (past a certain size, a big company can't use 
software supported by one guy in a garage in Germany - and also we're 
running too much stuff that is unsupported by Sun, which gets to be an 
issue in a 24x7 operation - but the software works great)

Down the road, we're moving to Solaris 2.8 and I'm really hopeful about 
"xinerama" which comes with X11 R6. xinerama is supposed to make the two 
screens into one. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, hope to do so in a 
week or three. I'm looking forward to GNOME.

On the down side, some of our application vendors are speccing that 
they  **REQUIRE** CDE. We're going to have to do some work with that. 
Nobody wants to go back to CDE (except for the guys doing the application 
support.)

I am having a problem trying to have the GoodStuff work on HP-UX 10.20. It
works good with IBM AIX. I am using fvwmrc which spawns the GoodStuff. I
couldn't find the source code GoodStuff.c ( if there is one at all) to
compile it on the HP-UX. Need some help.

Thanks

Goodstuff was part of fvwm1.  We no longer support fvwm1,
believe me, its for your own good.

However, if you go to www.fvwm.org, and then go to downloads, you
will find fvwm1.24r which does contain Goodstuff.c.

Please consider upgrading to fvwm2.  Fvwm2 contains a script that
will do most of the .fvwmrc conversion you might need.
In fvwm2, Goodstuff was replaced by FvwmButtons.

I added ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage and it didn't change
anything. I tried your whole configuration above and it didn't help my
problem, which is xemacs always appearing on desk 0 regardless of the
currently desk. You configuration always makes it appear on a certain
page, but it still always appears on desk 0. Maybe I'm missing
something you are suggesting.

Thanks,

I'm sorry, I usually only run with one desk and 2x2 pages.
I didn't pay any attention to the page vs. desk distinction,
I figured you'd set the page and desk as you wanted.

I just changed what I supplied to this:

Style "*macs*" StartsOnPage 1 0 0, SkipMapping
Style "*macs*" NoPPosition
Style "*macs*" ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage

Brought up the pager, and started XEmacs and it came up on desk 1,
at page 0,0.

StartsOnPage with 3 arguments treat the args as "desk" "page-x" "page-y".

Hope this helps.

Can someone tell me how to remap the Alt-tab keys functionality to a new set
of keys? I have tried to change it through the system.fvwm2rc file, but it
does not seem to have an affect ( I don't have a personal .fvwm2rc file in
my home directory). I need to do this so fvwm doesn't intercept the signal
before it gets to my ICA client running a windows NT profile. So that I can
tab between applications in the ICA client and use a different key mapping
to tab between applications on the X desktop. Thanks.
 
Alex

Thanks, but not really - my intent is to get xemacs frames to appear
on the current desk (no matter what number that is).

Actually I just figured out a solution, if I do the following it
works (xemacs frames all get moved to the current desk):

# start copy
*FvwmEventPassId
*FvwmEvent add_window AddWindowFunc

AddToFunc AddWindowFunc
+ "I" WindowId $0 ("emacs") MoveToDesk $d
#end

However, if instead I use the following, which is what I had been
trying, (with the same FvwmEvent configuration), it does not work (all
emacs frames appear on desk 0):

# start
AddToFunc AddWindowFunc
+ "I" WindowId $0 ("emacs") MoveToDesk 0 $d
#end

I understand why the first works, but I'm not sure why the second one
doesn't work.

In any case, thanks for your help.

You should mention the release you are using.  I'm going to assume
its a current beta.

You can remove the built in binding like this:

Key Tab A M -

You can assign the window list to Control Tab like this:

Key Tab A C WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort

Unfortunately control-tab doesn't seem to be a good key to use
with the SelectOnRelease feature in the current betas.  Maybe someone
else has a better key to use.

Due to the current way that FVWM expands $d, it is expanded to 0 (or
whatever your desk was when the function was defined).

If you want $d to be expanded at function execution time, you should
escape it in functions - $$d. Then both examples should work.

Mikhael.

I tried this and you are correct. Thanks for the explanation.

Dear List,

I am sure that this problem has been documented many
times before, so I apologise now....

My question is, sometimes after I have logged in (via
XDM) and the AnotherLevel (Lestiff) has loaded, the
buttons on any window (like xterm, rxvt, gxedit, etc)
stop working, that is to say, when you click on them,
no menu appears. The only way around this, I have
found is to log out and log in again.

1. What causes this???
2. How do I fix this??

Thanks in Anticipation,
Regards,

Thomas Adam

>From our FAQ:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
0.1  A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse
     bindings stop working. What can I do?

A: Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed. See
   Q 5.5 for more details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5  Why do NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock interfere with
     ClickToFocus and/or my mouse bindings?

A: Because they are treated as modifiers. You can use the
   IgnoreModifiers command to turn individual modifiers off for
   bindings. With XFree86 the right command is

     IgnoreModifiers L25

   If you changed your modifiers manually or are using a different
   X server use the 'xmodmap' command to find out which modifiers
   correspond to the keys you want to switch off.

   This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending
   on your CPU, network connection, the number of Key Mouse commands
   in your configuration file and the number of modifiers you want to
   ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast machine or very few
   bindings you should not ignore more than two modifiers. So do
   not ignore scroll-lock if you have no problem with it.

   A better way to solve this problem is to modify the keyboard
   mapping of your X server. The commands

     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod2"
     xmodmap -e "clear Mod5"

   remove the CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock from the keyboard map.
   Pressing these keys has no effect then. To re-add them try this:

     xmodmap -e "add Lock = Caps_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod2 = Num_Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock"

   Fvwm has to be restarted to use the changes made by xmodmap.
   Please refer to the man page of the xmodmap command for further
   details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(You need a 2.3.x beta for the IgnoreModifiers command).

Hello.

I build one of the last version of 2.3.x and have some
questions about weird things which were not in 2.2.x.

1) Default Icon position

In the 2.2.x, icons were by default handles as in twm. In
the first time I iconify a window, it place the icon where
the pointer is - i.e., the "Iconify" button. Now, it is
placed in the "Default IconBox". As I could get from the
manual, the default iconbox cannot be destroyed. So, how can
I achieve the previous behavior?

2) Icons moving.

In the 2.2.x, I used this string to drag icons and windows:

Mouse 0 SFWTI M Move

Now, it doesn't work for Icons. What can I do to move icons
by mouse?

3) MinOverlapPlacement consider Icons

Well, it is like I said. New Window starts aside from icons,
I want it to cover them and avoid only overlaping with the
normal windows. "SnapAttraction 1 Windows" didn't help

And, question not concerning icons.

4) Smart placements places windows in a physical screen
instead of desktop - i.e. it failed is there is no space in
the screen (however it can place them in the desktop)

Thanks for your attention.
Max.

You can't.  Well, at least not untils you fetch the latest
copy from CVS.  I have added an option to the IconBox style.  Now
you can say

  Style * IconBox None

To disable the default icon box.

This should work.  Please post your config file so we can see
what's wrong.

Right now you don't have detailed control over the placement
policy other than using one of the predefined options.  In the
future we will probably add much more flexibility in window
placement.  However, you could place your icons on a lower
layer:

  AddToFunc my_iconify
  + I Iconify on
  + I Layer 1

  AddToFunc my_deiconify
  + I Layer default
  + I Iconify off

Then use my_(de)iconify everywhere to (de)iconify your windows.
With the modification I made to the MinOverlapPercentPlacement
style, windows/icons on lower layers will be covered more often
than windows/icons above them.  You will need the current
source code, though.

Yes.  SmartPlacement has always worked this way.  New windows are
always placed on a specific page of the desktop.  This is normally
the current page unless other options override that.

        ^^^^^^^

This is incorrect, sorry.  Use "Layer -1" instead.

Hello,

I am trying to have fvwm2 process the following from a config file
but I am having some difficulties with the variables $1, $2, and $3.

The command is:

/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /bin/sh -c (/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{
 printf("#%02X%02X%02X\t", $1, $2, $3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++)
 printf " " $i; print "" }' | /usr/bin/less)

(the parentheses are not working outside fvwm for some reason so you can
enter the above without parentheses at a shell prompt and have no less)

Note: the following works from a shell prompt (all one one line):

/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{
 printf("#%02X%02X%02X\t", $1, $2, $3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++)
printf " " $i; print "" }' | /usr/bin/less

Now I tried the following and a few other things but
they did not work (although the $i works fine)...

[snip]

+ "RGB" "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm-e /bin/sh -c
"(/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{ printf(\"#%02X%02X%02X\t\", $$$$1,
$$$$2, $$$$3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++) printf \" \" \$i; print \"\" }' |
/usr/bin/less)"

[snip]

Could someone please point what went wrong?

Thanks!

The order of the binding commands in your config file is wrong:


> Mouse 3 TSFI A   Right-Border

Binds Right-Border to button 3 with any modifier.

> Mouse 0 SFWTI M  Move

Binds Move to all buttons with Meta.

> Mouse 1 TI A     Title-1

Binds Title-1 to button 1 with any modifier.  This overrides the
Meta-button 1 binding from the previous line.

> Mouse 0 I A      Iconify off

Binds "Iconify off" to all buttons with any modifier, thus
removing the bindings from above three lines.  You should specify
bindings in the opposite order:

  Mouse 0 I A      Iconify off
  Mouse 1 TI A     Title-1
  Mouse 0 SFWTI M  Move
  Mouse 3 TSFI A   Right-Border

The responsible code was changed between 2.2.x and 2.3.x to handle
this situation properly.  With 2.3.x, newer binding commands
override older commands so you can change them without restarting.

This does not work because the shell that executes this line
interprets the parentheses and pipe symbols.  They have to be
quoted (and then you don't need the parentheses at all.  The
positional parameters have to be quoted too:

  /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /bin/sh -c "/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{
   printf(\"#%02X%02X%02X\t\", \$1, \$2, \$3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++)
   printf \" \" $i; print \"\" }' | /usr/bin/less"

The easiest way to make it work is to put it in a script.  Then
you don't have to worry about fvwm's quoting.

> + "RGB" "I" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm-e /bin/sh -c
> "(/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{ printf(\"#%02X%02X%02X\t\", $$$$1,
> $$$$2, $$$$3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++) printf \" \" \$i; print \"\" }' |
> /usr/bin/less)"

Um, did you try to add this to a function or a menu?  If it's a
menu, the line must begin with

  + "RGB" Exec

if it's a funtion it must start with

  + "I" Exec

But you used

  + "RGB" "I" Exec

8-)

Also, the command must be "xterm -e" not "xterm-e".  And again,
the '$1' must be quoted (e.g. with a backslash):

  + I Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /bin/sh -c
  "/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk '{ printf(\"#%02X%02X%02X\t\",
  \$$$$1, \$$$$2, \$$$$3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++)
  printf \" \" $i; print \"\" }' | /usr/bin/less"

> Could someone please point what went wrong?

Just to give you an idea why this is so complicated:  This line
is executed as a normal fvwm command that adds a new item to a
complex function that executes an xterm command that starts a
shell to run a script that runs a pipe which includes an awk
script that prints positional parameters with a format mask.
If my count is correct, quotes, '|' symbols and '$' are
interpreted up to eight times by at least four different parsers
(fvwm, sh, awk and xterm) in this chain.  Each of these parsers
has a different idea how things work.  In this situation it is
almost always better to get these commands straight on the command
line, then put them in a shell script and execute the script from
the function.

Bye

Yes, thank you. I rewrite my config and get the desired
behavior. But, placement trick you suggested seems not to
work (and MinOverlap_Percent_ is also not I wanted). Also,
default icon position could be selected more clever (I
think, it is possible to place the only IconBox by FvwmAuto
- I will try to do this). I rarely use fvwm2 for programs
which require large desktop size, and the gotten behavior is
good enough.

Thanks for your help.

Is there a way to set a short delay on SloppyFocus before it brings a different
window into focus?  I line up all my windows to the upper left of the screen,
immediately under the task bar.  And I leave about 10p of space on the right
side clear so that the root window shows.  This allows me to move the cursor
over the root window so I can easily access the customized menus I have with the
mouse.  However, when I do this, if one of the under-lying windows extends
beyond the focused window, even if it's just a pixel or two, I lose focus of
the window I'm working on.  Is there a way to set up a short delay so I can pass
over another window on route to the root window without losing focus of the
window I'm working on?

Thanks,

Glen

There is no way to do this that I'm aware of.

Either bind the menu to a key, or bind the menu to mouse button over
a window title, button, or frame.  To not interfere with existing
mouse bindings, you can use the motion or double click modifiers.

I think using a key makes the most sense.

Thanks Dominik for your comments. I got the script to work by
removing the parentheses and testing it first on the command line,
then within a subshell, then within an xterm that runs the subshell,
and finally through an Fvwm menu and by running ps aux | grep awk
I could debug the line in the fvwm script while my xterm was drunk.

Here is the line I eventually got to work in my .fvwm2rc file.
My mail client broke it all up but that's OK...

+                "RGB" Exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /bin/sh -c
'/usr/X11R6/bin/showrgb | /bin/awk "{ printf(\"#%02X%02X%02X\t\", \$$$$1,
\$$$$2, \$$$$3); for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++) printf \" \" \$i; print
\"\" }" | /usr/bin/less'

It's a bit messy but at least I don't have to keep track of external
scripts! 8-)

Have a nice day,

Neil

Wondering if someone can help me.

I have a Sun Ultra 10 and just installed X11R6.5 and fvwm 2.3.9.  When
attempting to xinit to start fvwm, I get the following error message:

Fatal server error:
Cannot open /dev/kbd, error 13

xinit:  Error 0 (errno 0):  Server error.

However, my console keyboard exists and is functioning:

$ cd /dev
$ ls -las kbd
   2 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          31 Jan 20 16:49 kbd ->
../devices/pseudo/conskbd@0:kbd

Anyone know how I might be able to work through this error message?  Please
email me back at veisler@dynamicsoft.com

Thanks,

Vaughn Eisler

You might like a more current beta than 2.3.9.

Of course that has nothing to do with a keyboard problem.
Errno 13 is a permission problem.

Take a look at the permissions on the file that /dev/kbd points to.
Heres what mine looks like:

pork> ls -al /devices/pseudo/conskbd@0:kbd    
crw-------  1 dane  mk    0,   0 Jun 15  2000 /devices/pseudo/conskbd@0:kbd

  while you cannot (probably) delay the focus grabbing you can prevent
the window from being raised (man FvwmAuto), it's not exactly the same
thing as you want but it's the closest thing I can think of...

  doesn't look like fvwm problem but like X server problem.try to use
some other program instead of fvwm (xterm or whatever else) and see if X
will come up, once you have X running (no window manager) you can run
fvwm

I wanted to thank everyone for helping me out this morning about starting up
fvwm2 and the permission problems with /dev/kbd.  Permissions were not being
setup correctly upon login to Solaris.

However, I am now running into another issue that you may be able to assist
me with.  I suppose it may be an X problem vs. an fvwm problem, but I
thought I would try here first.

When attempting to start up X via xinit, I am getting the error message:

Fatal server error:
Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already
running

Unfortunately, I am not running another version of X.  I am running Solaris
2.8, which is running its own Desktop Login.  However, I have disabled that
and am logging in via the command line.

Any assistance you can provide is appreciated.

Thanks,

Vaughn Eisler

You should tell us what you did and what message was generated.

You may want to check the permissions in /tmp, the Solaris X server
sets up some fifos there for X.

I am sorry.  To generate this message, I logged in as a local user and typed
xinit.  I have an .xinitrc file which has one call to create an xterm and
calls fvwm2.

One of the 2 commands in your .xinitrc has to hold the session.
(Ie. it can't have an ampersand at the end.)

Make sure /tmp is writable by you.

Heres how I start X:

  xinit -- -nobanner -ar1 200 -ar2 20 2>&1 | tee /tmp/xinit.out

The "tee" at the end allows me to capture any messages I might miss.

If you are logging in as root, you may be able to truss xinit and
see the problem:

  truss -f xinit -- -nobanner -ar1 200 -ar2 20 2>&1 | tee /tmp/xinit.out

Hi FVWM folks,

I have recently installed fvwm2 on NetBSD.  I have something
misconfigured, however.  I cannot see any icons within 
programs, 

For example, xbiff is installed and is supposed to show up
on the window manager box, but I have a blank space.  Netscape
fires up, but the buttons do not have any icons on them.

What did I miss here?  How do I get the icons to display?

Thanks,

Nancy

Please tell us which version of fvwm you are using.

Hard to say. If you post your configuration file we will take a
look.

What does "icons within programs" mean?  Do you mean that you
can't see any icons when you minimize a program?

What is a "window manager box"?  Do you mean FvwmIconBox?

What "Netscape buttons" are you refering to?  Do you mean the
buttons on the Netscape title bar or the buttons Netscape puts
above the "back" and "reload" buttons?

I'm not sure what would cause that.  Sounds like you are displaying
icons, you just aren't displaying any color.

Fvwm doesn't control the icons within Netscape.  Sounds like a more
general problem.

That would be expected, if you are using desktop icons,
FvwmIconBox would have nothing to show.

Sounds like you are running FvwmButtons with FvwmIconMan and some other
stuff inside it.  Its not clear whether xbiff is not in the button bar
or whether its just not displaying any color.

Its still hard to tell from what you've described.

Do you see any color on the screen at all?

What does the command "xdpyinfo" print?

I'm not familiar with the NETBSD setup.  If you are using "startx",
you might try:

startx 2>&1>/tmp/errors.out

All your error message should end up in /tmp/errors.out

Always cc the fvwm list.

  I've heard about this problem few times, IIRC it had something to do
with specific depth (16 bpp?), or something like that, you might want to
try to search for solution to this particular problem... or simply try
different bpp...

Hi,

i am using FVWM 2.3.25
when i click on minimize button of netscape, the
minimized icon is put with half blue and half white
background. 
and my fvwm background is also white(this gif i put
delibratly).
now i want to change this netscape icon background
combination to some other (may be blue and grey).
but don't know how to set it and where to set it.

even i couldn't figure out from where this icon image
is being picked up, and how(which resource file) did
it get instruction to invoking that particular file.

i found few netscape.xpm files, but on opening those
using xv, images are coming correct, i mean the way i
want(blue and grey background).

i am not sure where does it need to change, some image
or resource.

any help is appreciated.

regards
Abinash K. Yadav

Ok, this part indicates  that you are  running with an 8 bit colormap.
This restricts the number of colors you can display at once to 256.

If you  expect that you  should  have more colors available,  then you
want to look at the way  you have XFree configured.  Try  to get it to
set the color depth to 16, 24, or 32 instead of 8.

If you expect to only have 8  bit color, you have to  try to deal with
your colormap.   The  first rule is to   always start Netscape  with a
private colormap, like this:

netscape -install

there are a lot of other  rules.  I suspect that you  don't want 8 bit
color.

I was wondering if we would see any messages about being unable to
allocate a color.

Like I said, I'm not familiar with NETBSD, but if you can find where
it starts fvwm (.xinitrc?), you can do the same trick with fvwm:

fvwm2 2>&1 >/tmp/fvwm.out

Yes, well you want to stay on the list, to get expert help from the
others that also read the list, and to have them spot my mistakes.

The icon you see is built into Netscape.
Half the background is blue, the other half is transparent.

My copy of Netscape has a Netscape.ad file where it assigns
names to its icons, but I don't see the actual icons anywhere,
I think they are actually built in.

Note that xv shows the transparency as gray, this can be
misleading.

The latest betas will allow you to override the Netscape icon,
do:

Style Netscape* icon myicon.xpm, IconOverride

if your version doesn't support that, try 2.3.28.

Hi,
however same user when login in cde environment, icon
colour is perfact(blue and grey), what is turning that
in to white in case of FVWM ?

2.3.25, is probably not supporting icon over-riding as
i didn't see any change after doing this in .fvwm2rc
file.

and for some reason i want to stick to 2.3.25.

any other possibilties?

regards
Abinash K. Yadav

Fvwm is not turning the gray into white.  The icon is half blue
and half TRANSPARENT.  There is a difference between white and
transparent.  You are seeing the background thru the transparent
parts of the icon.

Apparently, CDE doesn't support shaped icons and its providing its
own background.

Huh?

If you want to override the Netscape icon and use fvwm,
I think you are going to have to use the version of fvwm
that contains that feature.

You could try compiling fvwm2 with './configure --disable-shape'. It 
should give you some oldschool icons with no transparency :-).

sa

P.S. IconOverride is very nice, that default netscape icon was
pissing me off.

The shape extension can be disabled with the --disable-shape

The IconOverride style was introduced in 2.3.2.

Well, if you insist on using a buggy, unstable version you will be
on your own fast, especially when talking about icon styles.  We
spent quite some time to get icon handling straight, and you are
insisting on one of the releases that had the responsible code
screwed up.

I just looked on the fvwm page and found the archive,
but when browsing the archive, it seems to be organized
by date and not by thread.  You can view threads, but 
it seems that these threads are limited to those messages
sent that day.  Perhaps I did not look carefully enough.

Is there anywhere I can go to browse by threads? 

Thanks

I'm noticing that there are a lot of new clients that
people are running on KDE and gnome, for example my
coworkder is using a new mail client that seems to work
quite nice.  

Is FVWM KDE and GNOME compliant? Meaning can I run these
clients under FVWM?  If not, when will they be?  

With the big push towards linux (did you read CNN today?,
IBM has promised 1 billion in developement in the Linux
environment), it seems that these two WM are getting 
most of the attention.  Is it possible that there will
come a day when it is no longer feasible to stay loyal
to FVWM?  

I have not been reading the list lately so please forgive
my blatent ignorance.

Hi, thanks for the info.  

I have a multi-head system at home, if I'm running FVWM, can I run GNOME or
KDE on top of it?  My understanding is that GNOME and KDE cannot be used
with multiple monitors, can they if FVWM is the underlying window manager?

How does one go about running GNOME and KDE on top of FVWM?  I remember that
in RH there is a file where you place either GNOME, KDE, or AnotherLevel
depending on which you wanted to run.  This seemed to suggest that you had
to run one or the other, this was the source of my confusion 

Thanks again

The 2.3.x betas and forthcoming 2.4.x release of FVWM are GNOME
compliant.

As soon as someone who knows something about KDE implements it or helps
one of us implement it, FVWM will be KDE compliant, too.

Please note that even if the WM is not <desktop>-compliant, you can
still run the applications!

The applications will put up special hints that a compliant WM will use
to allow enhanced behaviors, so they will appear to work better in some
ways (dealing with WM issues like movement, iconification, etc.) with a
compliant WM.  But, they will still fundamentally _work_ with FVWM,
regardless.

Please remember that FVWM is a window manager, and KDE and GNOME are
desktop environments.  Not the same thing at all.

Both KDE and GNOME have window managers as components of the complete
desktop.  Both allow you to use a _different_ window manager if you
choose.

So, you can use FVWM with KDE and/or GNOME if you want.  GNOME, in
particular, has a suite of managers that it works with and doesn't seem
to really prefer one over the rest.

Some parts of FVWM overlap with some parts of the desktops; for example,
FVWM has an icon manager/window list module, and KDE/GNOME have their
own.  That's no problem; you pick the one you like and use that, and
don't use the other.

A few more questions if you don't mind.  What, if any, desktop environment
runs with FVWM by default?  Can you reccomend a reference to some
documentation so I can try and get a better grip on this subject?

Thx

  kde or gnome: a mess of a desktop related stuff, they offer their own
(or preferred) winddow manager, session manager (replacement for xdm).

  to answer your question - you do not run gnome or kde. you run gnome
or kde preferred window manager if you want and you run various kde or
gnome apps. you can run kde and gnome apps no matter which window
manager you use. there are some hints that gnome apps use (probably kde
apps as well) but in general they are not crucial.

I really like the new window placement algorithms (MinOverlapPlacement, etc),
but I was wondering if it would be a good idea to add optional parameters,
similar to how icons are placed in an iconbox, so that, for instance, 
windows are placed starting from the top left of the screen, going down 
and then right.

Or have I missed something in my configuration?  ^.^

  seeing is believing:

  try to run the X server itself: X :1 (in most default linux configs
that would start new X server on virtual console 8) you should see only
grey (sort of, black&white pattern) destop, no windows just mouse cursor
(cross)


  notice that you cannot really do anything because X does not have any
built in support for moving windows, menus or anything similar. it's
just a server that waits until somebody wants to draw something (an x
client).

  now go back to where you started X from (ctrl z bg <enter> to get the
command line back) and start e.g. xterm -display :1 & then switch back
to X server and you will see xterm but notice that it has no borders, no
title it's just plain window that you cannot resize or move.

  now start a window manager - for example fvwm, you can later kill it a
start different window managers (you probably have at least twm) just to
see that window manager is just another program... you could possibly
run the X without window manager even (some kiosk application or
something like that).

  that's all you need, you do not need any extra desktop environment.

  when it comes to gnome and kde the whole picture is suddenly muddy as
hell - for some reason they try to persuade user that there's just one
thing - the gnome or kde, respectively. but the truth is that there are
quite a few independent things that you need (or might want):

  a way to launch applications
  a way to see which apps are running and switch from one to another
  virtual desktop
  sound server so that more than one app can output sound at the same
time
  drag and drop support
  ...

  there is number of application for each of the above, gnome and kde
are basically packaged sets of apps  that are somewhat integrated
(common settings etc.), but there is no need to run any particular
desktop environment, in most cases the window manager is sufficient (to
get the work done, you might still want to run gnome or kde for various
reasons).

  you can start various parts of gnome or kde as you like, you can also
run various kde and gnome apps.

  hope this clarifies it a bit. I am not aware of good docs for this,
browsing some book on administration of X might help...
