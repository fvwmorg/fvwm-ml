Yes.  You need to add the -lgen flag when linking.

This is because I wasn't thinking when I put that in there...  Go into
fvwm.c and remove the basename reference and all will go well.

I've removed this for the next pl.  I'm not even certain why I put it
in there in the first place.

I cannot get Fvwm2.0 FvwmConfig to compile.  Make stops with an error...  
It's the -lX11 part on the compiler command line.  What do I do?

Glad to hear it.

Of course...

Chad> 1)  When I create an rlogin button, that is

Odd.  The line looks ok.  Use FvwmIdent to find out the Name of the
xterm when it comes up, to make sure it's being set to "routh".

Chad> 2)  I installed fvwm2 to use on a SPARCstation 20 with SunOS
Chad> 4.1.3, which acts as a server for several other machines.

I've never seen this problem before.  I just played with it a little
right now, and my horizontal and vertical edge scrolling are both the
same speed, and react equally well to slow and fast mouse movement,
although an EdgeResistance w/ a low first param seemed better for fast
movement.  Not sure what to tell you here...

Chad> 3)  If the SaveDesk module is used, with a 'Read .fvwmdesk' at
Chad> the end of the .fvwm2rc file, then FvwmForm no longer works,
Chad> i.e. I have a QuitVerify module that uses FvwmForm as given in
Chad> the FvwmForm man page and this works so long as the 'Read
Chad> .fvwmdesk' is not used.  A strange bug!?

This is probably because FvwmForm doesn't use the standard config
reading function, but rather reads the .fvwm2rc itself directly.  This
has been fixed for the next release.

Chad> 4)  If FvwmBacker is used to set up some intial backgrounds with
Chad> xpmroot or xv or xsetroot, the 'xv -root -quit -max
Chad> filename.gif' is used from a menu to set a background on one
Chad> desk, then all of the desks are changed to that image.  Flipping
Chad> desks does not change back to the default background.  If
Chad> xpmroot is used from a menu, then only the current desk is
Chad> changed, but when flipping back to this desk, the default
Chad> background is back.  This is because FvwmBacker has not been
Chad> made aware of this change.  A proper cure for both of these
Chad> problems is to provide a way for menu items to send commands
Chad> directly to FvwmBacker or any other module for that matter.
Chad> Todd Fries offered a nice solution to this problem by using a
Chad> complex function and Read command with a separate file for each
Chad> background, each file containing the command to be passed to the
Chad> FvwmBacker module.

I just played with these situations, and couldn't reproduce the xv
problem (I had the 'correct' behavior, explained next).  The xpmroot
'problem' is the correct behavior.  FvwmBacker gets new desk messages
from fvwm, and runs the specified commands.  So setting the background
manually, then changing desks should cause FvwmBacker to reset it to
what it should.

If you want to manually set the backgrounds, then you should probably
kill FvwmBacker when you do (use a function that runs xv or xpmroot
and does a KillModule on FvwmBacker), and restart FvwmBacker when you
want it running again.  Or you could use the multiple config file
reread solution, which is useful for many things.

Chad> 5)  When the FvwmConfig is used to to change the default Back
Chad> and Fore colors of window borders, the FvwmButtons bar loses its
Chad> Style ClickToFocus.

I've never played with this module, but I'll look into this problem.

Chad> Has anyone else experienced these problems or does anyone have
Chad> hacks or work-arounds for them?  In my opinion, these issued

Chad> fvwm2 can be released.

When the first official release goes out, there are still going to be
several bugs.  And many people will find ones that no one else sees
and that others can't reproduce.  It (or any other program) will never
be completely bug free.  At some point (when it seems least harmful)
the bullet must be bitten and it gets officially released.

My main concern is cleaning up the make and install process (for the
most part anyways) and any easy to fix, commonly encountered bugs that
are particularly annoying, then get it out there.  It's been in beta
for quite a while.  Then take care of the rest (and the million more
that will get reported) as I (we) can.  Especially since some fairly
big changes are going to be needed to take care of some things, and
any changes (to any program) potentially introduce or uncover more
bugs.

An aside: tkgoodstuff has:
  1: easy menu creation and binding of popup menus to button-down events
     (ask me if you want to know how); but more importantly:
  2: a "Net" client that is tailor made to this task (managing a ppp
     connection), which not only toggles the connection but indicates
     its status with text and/or icon changes.  Also included is a GUI
     repeat dialer with GUI-configuration of login script, etc.

It's also an fvwm client, and has built-in clock, biff, xload, etc.

I couldn't get 2.0.39 to build on Solaris, the first problem I found was
because nsl and sockets wasn't being linked in, which Imake should have taken
care of, right?

The second was due to a call to "basename" in fvwm.c.  What library is this
from?

Since I have had no response to my original problem, maybe someone can tell me 
where to look to try and understand what is going on.  As it stands I cannot 
use
fvwm2 (pl39) at all.

Ok, I don't ALWAYS run strace on fvwm when I first try it out, and I don't
always HAPPEN to not put the right path for my modules and pixmaps in my
.fvwmrc file.

But then again, I didn't happen to notice that fvwm tries, after not
finding a module, say:

FvwmPager

It looks for 

FvwmPager.gz

or a pixmap, say

mini.fvwm.xpm

it looks for

mini.fvwm.xpm.gz, and then .Z

(e.g.: 
  access("/users/tfries/media/images/xpm//mini.term.xpm", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
  access("/users/tfries/media/images/xpm//mini.term.xpm.gz", R_OK) = 0
  write(3, "\3\2\2\0)\0\0\0\16\0\2\0)\0\0\0", 16) = 16
  read(3, "\1\0C\10\3\0\0\0 \0\0\0\1\0\0\1\377"..., 32) = 32
  read(3, "=\0X\0=\0X\0\0\0\377\277", 12) = 12
  read(3, "\1\10D\10\0\0\0\0)\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 32) = 32
  pipe([6, 7])                            = 0
  fork()                                  = 14629
  close(7)                                = 0
  fstat(6, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|0600, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
  read(6, "/* XPM */\nstatic char *mini[] ="..., 4096) = 4096
)

This is really cool that the pixmaps load from a gzip -9 'ed file.  However,
the modules do not.

(e.g.:
  access("/s1/linux/local/lib/fvwm/FvwmPager", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
  access("/s1/linux/local/lib/fvwm/FvwmPager.gz", X_OK) = 0

Ohwell, you can't have everything, can you? <grin>

Another thing that I've noticed, having a BUNCH of 'mini.xlock.xpm' 's 
in my xlock menu is that it loads a separate copy for every icon, even if
they are the exact same filename.  I believe that there could be some
optimization here?

I didn't respond initially because I hoped that another DEC Alpha user
would speak up.  I've never heard or seen anything like this myself
(on any platform).  I know that there are other Alpha users out there

Hi

I want to write a .fvwmrc which provides a slightly
different setup on our Decs/Suns/SunMono's.  I thought I'd
get FvwmCpp to run over it and I check for the various
defines it produces (COLOR, SERVERHOST, etc).

It seems I have to start fvwm with an invocation something like:

% fvwm -f "FvwmCpp /home/ian/.fvwmrc"

to process the file, and I also have to modify the fvwm code to
accept a ';' as a comment instead of the '#', since cpp barfs
on all the fvwm '#' comments.

This seems a bit laborious - how does everyone else do it ??

Cheers

Ian

Is it possible to make FVWM 2 pop up a dialog box like Motif and HP Vue when a

sub-pulldown-menu ?

I would think that, for cpp, you change the '#'s in .fvwmrc to
/*  message */
and cpp would take the out.

I know a few people out there use FvwmCpp.  I don't use any
preprocessor myself, so perhaps I'm not as qualified to answer, but
let me provide 2 suggestions:

1) you could probably just start it normally, but have your .fvwmrc
   contain only one line:

   FvwmCpp /home/ian/.fvwmrc-cpp

2) Use C style comments instead of altering the fvwm code to use ';'.
   Much easier - cpp will take care of them for you.

Yes. Use FvwmForm according to the manual. Short man:
Type this in an directory in your module path:

ln -s /yourfvwmpath/bin/FvwmForm QuitVerify

Type this in your .fvwmrc (ver 2) file:

*QuitVerifyGrabServer
*QuitVerifyFont         -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*QuitVerifyButtonFont   -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
*QuitVerifyFore         Black
*QuitVerifyBack         #adadad
*QuitVerifyItemFore     Black
*QuitVerifyItemBack     #adadad
*QuitVerifyCommand      Beep
*QuitVerifyLine         center
*QuitVerifyText         "Do you really want to logout?"
*QuitVerifyLine         expand
*QuitVerifyButton       quit            "Logout"        ^M
*QuitVerifyCommand      Exec $HOME/bin/quit &  # Favourite logout command!
*QuitVerifyButton       quit            "Cancel"        ^[
*QuitVerifyCommand      Nop

And add this to a Goodstuff button (or to a menu):

*FvwmButtons - quit.xpm        Module QuitVerify

My favourite logout command is a shell: 

kill -9 `ps -x | awk '/286323198/ && ! /awk/ {print $1}'`

For this to work the last line in the .xinitrc file should be:

sleep 286323198

All other commands in the .xinitrc should have an & after them.

Then you'll have it.

I believe it should read

Actually, you can just invoke it with a parameter which is the name
you'd like to use (e.g. 'FvwmForm QuitVerify') instead of symbolically
linking it.

DEC Unix 3.2x added a subtle dependancy on libots.so.  This is a math library.
We've built many apps that link fine, start fine, but incure a run time symbol
not resolved long after the app has started.  It does spit out a nasty message
to stderr, but depending on how you started fvwm, you may not see this message.

Furture more, gcc substitutes it's own math lib and we've also seen apps that
where compiled with gcc did not groak.

So add: -lots to the link line for fvwm... ;-(

Well I, for one, use FvwmM4 instead :-)  However, you can use /* */
comments instead of # and FvwmCpp will do the right thing (obviously,
I hope).  If you've got a Cpp that handles C++ // comments then you
could use that instead.

Maybe fvwm is started from a point where the path does not yet include
the directory containing xv.  Sometimes, you can fix by calling out
the explicit path.  Also, something like this might shed more light:

   + "Gov Denies" Exec exec xv -blah_blah_etc >& $HOME/junk.xv

I've noticed the same kind of behaviour with a Sun IPC running fvwm 1.24.
Vertical edge scrolling since to work fine, but when I move the mouse
horizontally it just disappears at the side of the screen. I've got
no idea what causes this behaviour or of fvwm2 still has the same behaviour
on the IPC since I haven't compiled it yet under SunOS.

Greetings,
  Wichert.

Hm.

Well, maybe its a SPARC IPC problem then?  Especially since it's not
seen under the other SPARC's Chad mentioned above.

Do the SPARC IPC's have any kind of built in virtual desktop support
support (that makes it act like a really wide screen)?  I know IBM X
Stations have this support built in, and XFree86 under Linux has
something similiar (which caused odd problems for someone else on this
list at one point).  If it does, find out how to shut that feature off
and see if the problem goes away.  If not, I don't have any other
ideas yet...

I have a vague memory of all sorts of X problems on a Sun IPC with the
OpenWindows X/News server.  I gave up and built and installed the X11R5
sample server since I had the sources to hand.

This is caused by a multi-screen display! try running your x server with the
-zaphod argument (see the man pages). For multi-screen displays, when
you move the mouse to the edge of the screen, it tries to switch you to
the other screen. Since fvwm is doing something similar, the two
confict.

Hi!

   First of all... fvwm is really cool, and release 2 is really
fantastic. Good work. 
   I write this to ask a question. I use knews, an X news reader, and 
fvwm2.0 refuse to assign it an icon. Probably it is a knews problem,
but... To explain better. I have 

   Style "knews"      Icon bigworld.xpm

in my config file. The same icon image is used for netscape, for
exemple, so I know the icon exist and it is in the path. With fvwm2.0 
knews come up without icon (in 1.2 it worked well). I tried with 
FvwmIdentify, and it recognize the iconized windows (only the title :) 
as Name: knews Class: Knews. 
   
    Is this a known problem or have I to give you more data? Please
tell me, I am new to this list and I do not want to waste BW.

Hello Everyone,

I would like to say again that fvwm2 is quite awesome!  It adds an entirely
new depth to working with your computer.  After using it for only a couple
of weeks now, it would be very difficult to go back to twm.

I have been trying to work out a way to have menu options for choosing 
different backs for our network of Suns.   I used an idea suggested by Todd
Fries and cofirmed by Chuck Hines.  Here is the implementation so far

# Function for changing background patterns from menu
AddToFunc ChangeBack "I" Exec exec echo *FvwmBackerDesk $0 $1 > .fvwm2bktmp
+         "I" Read .fvwm2bktmp
+         "I" FvwmBacker

# Background Patterns
AddToMenu BackPatterns "Backgrounds" Title
+              "Honeycomb" ChangeBack $CurrentDesk "xpmroot 
/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps/background1.xpm"
+              "Lighthouse" ChangeBack $CurrentDesk "xv -root -quit -max 
/usr/local/share/backgrounds/lighthouse.gif"

This is a very nice streamlined method, theoretically speaking. :-)  It creates
a file with the appropriate command to send to FvwmBacker, then reads the 
command from the temporary file.  There are two problems, though.  First, there
is global variable CurrentDesk that can be accessed from the menu, i.e. 
$CurrentDesk=''.  Does anyone know if there is a variable that has the value
of CurrentDesk?  Second, if I replace $CurrentDesk with a number, say 1, then
the FvwmBacker loads the new image or pattern, but the default image specified
in the .fvwm2rc file still dominates.  If you switch desks from desk 1 and then
back, the new pattern is there, but gets covered quickly by the default 
background pattern.  Does anybody know any solutions for this?




Thanks,

Chad

I'm an Fvwm newbie running version 2.0.39 on an SGI IRIX 5.3 system.
Most things work, but I can't get FvwmForm to do a QuitVerify box.
I've copied Example 1 from the FvwmForm man page into my .fvwmrc file,
and I invoke it in a menu that looks like this:

AddToMenu "Preferences" "Fvwm Control" Title
+ "Modules"               Popup Module-Popup
+ "Backgrounds"           Popup Backgrounds
+ "" Nop
+ "Window Functions"      Popup WindowFunctions
+ "" Nop
+ "Exit FVWM"             Module FvwmForm QuitVerify

When I do it, nothing happens.  How do I debug this?

Hello again,

Just two suggestions for potential additions to the "TODO" list, assuming 
they're not there already:

1.  a function (module?) that takes scattered icons and aligns them to a 
grid within an IconBox, perhaps with the option to sort them based on the 
icon title, class, etc.

2.  option to turn of "3D" beveling on things swallowed by FvwmButtons, 
eg. clocks and pagers.  Perhaps they could even appear "sunken", the 
reverse of a button.  That'd be cool.  

Cheers,

Dave

Hello, 

I've been using fvwm 2.0.x (2.0.27 for a long time, but switched to 2.0.39
last week - compiled without errors or even warnings btw with GCC 2.7.0!)
for quite some time on my Linux box (alternating between 1.2.13 and
1.3.31) and I'm quite happy with its performance!  Thanks very much Robert
and Chuck, and all the rest of you who've contributed to the effort.  It
does have great flexibility and utility, but I do have a couple questions
about its behavior... 

1.  I've found that when I iconify windows they very occasionally, 
seemingly without reason, either appear under or over other icons already 
present in the IconBox.  Has anyone else seen this behavior under Linux?

2.  Whenever I restart fvwm, whatever icons were already in the IconBox 
pop up in a different, seemingly random, order (still in rows and columns, 
just swapped around).  Suggestions?

3.  Sometimes when I double click on an icon to reopen its application, 
the application doesn't reappear where it was previously, but gets booted 
to some other pane of the desktop (same desktop, though).  When I grab it 
from the other pane and move it back to the original one on which it was 
first iconified and then iconify/uniconify it again, it again appears 
unexpectedly on another part of the desktop.  Only happens very 
occasionally, say 1 out of 30 or 40 applications I run.  Any ideas anyone?

Other than that, keep up the good work.
Cheers,

Dave

I suppose this is caused by a previously called instance of FvwmBacker.
Try adding a "KillModule FvwmBacker" before starting the new one.

Ciao,
 Andy.

Your menu is essentially the same as one I use without any problem, so
may be the problem is in your definition of QuitVerify. Here's what I
use, FWIW:

Are you using FvwmM4?  If so, run FvwmM4 with the -debug switch.
FvwmForm does not (yet) use the protocol to get its configuration but
rather relies on a command line argument indicating a file to look at.
Unfortunately, FvwmM4 removes that file by default.

Hi, y'all!

I have been using fvwm 2.0.38/39 for quite a while without any
problems on my SGI Indigo w/ IRIX 5.3 now.

Yesterday I decided to add mini icons to my menus.  When I reread
the menu definitions after doing all my changes I had to wait
forever (>15 seconds) until they were read in.  Withouth the
mini icons it never took longer than 2-3 seconds.

Of course it's taking just as long when I first log in or when
I restart fvwm.

Is this 'normal', i.e. does it have to take so long to read in
a few mini icons?  I wonder why nobody else has complained about
this before.  Could it be that it's happening just for me?

Maybe I am doing something wrong, though.  There are quite a few
colors in those mini icons.  Could that be slowing it down?

For benchmarking I took out the following menu, and read it in
separetly:

DestroyMenu Pictures
AddToMenu Pictures	"Pictures"		Title

+  "%mini.escher.xpm%Escher"		XSETROOT_b /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/escherknot -bg "sgi slate blue" -fg Blue4

Those macros are defined elsewhere:

AddToFunc XV_Back_Sp "I" exec xv_3 -root -rmode $0 -quit -noresetroot /home/spiegl/pic/$1
AddToFunc XSETROOT_s "I" exec xsetroot -solid $0
AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8

I found that it takes about 5 seconds to read and process
those lines.

Please comment!

Bye,
 Andy.

Hi Chuck,

a few weeks ago you wrote:

> > addressed.

I responded:
> Thanks.  I understand that you are busy (so am i :-).  If you don't
> find the reports/questions I sent to the list, ie. if you don't
> respond to them, I'll just repost them to the list.  Okay?

So, here is a recompilation of my reports/requests:

1.) .fvwm2rc:
    I get a coredump right after fvwm2 starts, when I ask for this:
 AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

    But it works fine when I ask for this:
 AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8

    I checked the man page for fvwm2 and it says $0 - $9 is fine, though.

2.) FvwmWinList: 
    *truncateleft doesn't work.  It still truncates right.

3.) FvwmTalk:
    It doesn't accept module specifications like "*FvwmWinListUseIconNames"
    The error message is:
      "No such module /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2 *FvwmWinListUseIconNames"

4.) Okay, here is a tricky one:
    In my .fvwm2rc I got:
 Key Up          A       SC      CursorMove  0 -1
 Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove  0 +1
 Key Up          A       SM      CursorMove  0  -10
 Key Down        A       SM      CursorMove  0  +10

    This works beautifully, unless a (popup) menu is open.  In that
    case Shift-Control-<cursor> (and even Shift-<cursor>) acts just
    like Shift-Meta-<cursor>.  Apparently the Meta-Flag is set while
    a menu is open.  Strange.
    Control-<cursor> also moves the cursor, but it seems like in
    tenths of a step.

5.) This is not a bug, but two questions:
    a) Did fvwm1's 'Cursor' command disappear completely, or is it
       just hidden somewhere?  If it's gone, why?
    b) What about fvwm1's commands "AppsBackingStore" and "BackingStore"?
       Are they gone, too?  Why?

6.) Another question, but more tricky I am afraid:
    How can I specify that an iconified FvwmPager always opens up
    at -1+1 ?  In order to simulate the old builtin pager, I got this:
 AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmPager 0 1
 *FvwmPagerHilight lightsteelblue
 *FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1
 *FvwmPagerLabel 0 Standard
 *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Extended
 *FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
 *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35
 *FvwmPagerStartIconic

    It starts up iconic, just like I want to have it, but of course
    it always shows up where all the other icons are, too.  But I
    want to have it at the upper right corner.  Is that possible?

7.) I would like to second the wish for "OpaqueResize" and for
    "TogglePage" and my personal wish would be a window-specific
    AutoRaise command/module, like a style-command or so.

8.) Still playing around with fvwm 2.0.38 I found that the behavior
    of complex functions is a little different than what I was used
    to from fvwm 1.24r.  I have the following function defined:

 AddToFunc WindowOps-or-Kill	"M" Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
 +				"C" Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
 +				"D" Delete
 +				"D" Close
 +				"D" Destroy

    What I thought this would do when I double click is this:
     1.) try to Delete the window
     2.) if 1.) failed try to Close the window
     3.) if 2.) failed also, Destroy the window.

    But what happens is that the window always gets destroyed.
    Is this a bug or a feature?  If it's a feature would it be
    possible to make this behavior optional?

9.) There is a DestroyMenu for re-defining Menus and Functions, which
    is a very nice feature.  Now I was wondering whether something
    similar can be done with module options?  Something like
    DestroyModule, to get back to the default behavior of the module?
    (I am not talking about KillModule)

    Since it's not possible to supply module options in FvwmTalk, it's
    necessary to restart fvwm2 whenever I changed something in my
    FvwmButtons.  That's too bad, since I can redefine everything
    else, like menus, funcs, etc.

10) In a recent posting, Makoto 'MAR_kun' MATSUSHITA wrote that there are
    a few FVWM modules out there which are not part of the standard
    distribution (FvwmAdlLog, FvwmIconMan-0.2, FvwmWish-0.8,
    fvwish-1.0, and tkfvwm0.5 and maybe more).  Could you possibly
    put those into the distribution, let's say in a (unsupported)
    contrib directory?  I bet many people are interested in them.

Finally I have to mention (as always):
 --> FVWM is a *fabulous* vwm!  <--

Thanks,
 Andy.

PS: Oops, I just had a (second) look at the TO-DO list.  I saw
    that tops 3.) and partially 6.) are in there.

I'm going through the ENUCFE (Endless New User Configuration File
Editing) phase with Fvwm 2.0.39.  To facilitate playing with modules,
I added functions like this to my .fvwmrc file:

AddToFunc RestartFvwmButtons
+ "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons

...which I call from a menu.  The intention was to be able to play
with config lines for a module and restart just the module, instead of
restarting Fvwm.

It doesn't work.  Even though the above function kills off the current
FvwmButtons process and replaces it with a new one, the new one uses
the old process's configuration.  Restarting fvwm itself *does* make
the new configuration lines "take".

The FvwmButtons man page says

   "During initialization, FvwmButtons will search for a
    configuration file....  The configuration file will be the one
    which fvwm used during its initialization."

Actually, no file is involved at all.  It might be better to say

   "During initialization, FvwmButtons asks fvwm for a configuration.
    Fvwm responds with the contents of the configuration file that was
    read by fvwm when fvwm was started."

This applies to the other modules too.

Hmm, there used to be a -k switch to tell FvwmM4 to keep the output.
I don't have the sources at hand to look, but I know I added it in
fvwm 1.2x.

I am no longer on this mailing list so I'd appreciate a personal email 
response to my email address (micah@wolfe.net).

Is there anyone out there that has gotten fvwm to compile on a NeXT? If 
so, I'd like to hear from you or I'd like to know what you've done in 
order for it to work. I got X installed on this NeXT but I can't STAND 
twm so I want to switch.

Thanks!

I had *exactly* this same problem and it drove me nuts.  The problem
turned out to be that I was linking with some old X libraries, from
OSF1/1.3 -- I think they were X11R4 or maybe 5.  But the include files
were for X11R6 -- somewhere along the line the <x,y> coordinates in
some event structures got shifted around.  The solution was to delete
the told X library and link with the correct ones.  The problem
promptly vanished.

Hope this works for you, too.

Hrm, this sounds like rather strange behavior.  What I do is create

~/.fvwm (a subdir)
~/.fvwm/fvwmrc
~/.fvwm/fvwm-styles
~/.fvwm/fvwm-menus
~/.fvwm/fvwm-modules

... etc ...

in fvwm-menus I have the following menu:

AddToMenu ReReadIt "*fvwm.xpm*" Title
+ "&Key bindings" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-keys
+ "&Mouse bindings" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-mouse
+ "M&odules" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-modules
+ "&Paths" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-paths
+ "&Styles" Read /home/todd/.fvwm/fvwm-style

Which you could easily adapt to be:

AddToFunc RestartFvwmButtons
+ "I" KillModule FvwmButtons
+ "I" Read /wherever/your/rcfile/for/goodstuffis
+ "I" Module FvwmButtons

I separated the files out, as I found that reading
them all isn't really necessary, and things like
re-reading all of the menus w/out putting
'DestroyMenu' infront of each menuname created
interestingly doubled-menus and functions that
would do things twice...

The problem I had on our alphas with fvwm-2.039 - moving windows is now 
resolved
thanks to Douglas Ghormley <ghorm@cayuse.CS.Berkeley.EDU> who put me on the 
right track.  My problem was not with the X11 libraries but with the header 
files - I had some old ones in /usr/local/include which was in my include path 
in front of /usr/include because that's where I had xpm.h.  Everything now 
works
fine! (thought I was going crazy there for a while...)

Thanks to everyone who had suggestions....

Hi folks,

I thought people might like to try this new Button. I use it as button 4
(first parameter) connected to the Iconify function. It is a big box cross by
an arrow to a little box in the opposite colour:

ButtonStyle 4 14 20x20@1 20x70@1 70x70@0 70x20@0 20x20@1 60x60@0 60x50@0
 60x60@0 50x60@0 60x60@0 60x80@0 80x80@0 80x60@0 60x60@0

Any comments, please email them direct to me - I no longer subscribe to the list
due to lack of time - it's doctoral thesis writing time guys! :-)

btw, compliements to Rob (or whoever it was) for the design of the vector
graphics representation for ButtonStyle - it's surprisingly easy to use,
even though I was brung up in the pixel based world :-)

Tara,
Ben.

	I was finally able to get FvwmConfig to compile under Slackware 
Linux by creating a symlink in the /usr/src/fvwm/libs directory to the 
libX11.a on my system.  You might want to put a note about this in your 
INSTALL file.

ln -s /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.a /usr/src/fvwm/libs/libX11.a

like that.  Now it compiles.  I hope it runs too.

Just checked this, it does work for me. Silly question: you are putting
it as:

    *FvwmWinListTruncateLeft

and not just *truncateleft (as in your message). Case shouldn't matter,
but the spelling does, of course.

I am the author of that code, by the way.

	Hi all,

	I'm using the beta.39 (great++) and the 3dpixmaps package 
(great_3d++). I'm putting some icons on my FvwmButtons and using a-la 
NeXTStep (sigh!) dock. My question is: is it possible to center the icons 
? Buttons leaves always some extra space for the empty label on each 
button space. (yes... I've rftm...). Btw, has anybody managed to 
"Swallow" a xbiff window ?...

	regards,

Clearly, the "right" thing to do is add "-L /usr/X11R6/lib" to your
makefile, not create symbolic links.  I assume you're using the
"makefile" instead of the "Imakefile".

BTW, I'd like to point out a small problem with having a "makefile" in
the FvwmConfig directory.  If you use the Imakefile to create a "Makefile",
and don't remove the "makefile", then make(1) (at least GNU make) will
choose the "makefile" in preference to the "Makefile".  I propose that
the "makefile" be renamed to "makefile.std" or similar, to avoid this
conflict.  Other packages follow this convention when a standard makefile
is supplied in addition to an Imakefile.

When fvwm (2.0.39) is restarted, windows on screens other than
the upper left screen change slightly in position.
This only happens on the first restart after a particular window's creation.

To illustrate, given a 2x2 desktop, whose four screens are labeled:

+-------+-------+
| (0,0) | (0,1) |
+-------+-------+
| (1,0) | (1,1) |
+-------+-------+

If you start an xterm in the empty screen (1,0), it will
place itself at geometry 80x24+0+0.  Both xwininfo and FvwmIdent report
this geometry.

Restart fvwm.

Recheck geometry of the xterm in screen (1,0).
Now xwininfo reports 80x24+-1+-1 while FvwmIdent still reports 80x24+0+0.

The window has truely moved - easily verified visually.  Only one pixel,
but now you can see the top pixel line from that xterm at the bottom
of screen (0,0).  Repeated restarts do not move the window further.

Anyone else observed this?  Is it a Bug or a Feature(tm)?  Anyone working
on it?  If it's a problem up for grabs I could take a look, but I don't
want to duplicate effort.  Chuck?

I have always favored the ClickToFocus model but have found the 
SloppyFocus in fvwm2 appealing. There is one thing I miss from 
ClickToFocus in that a button click anywhere in the window would raise 
it. I do not want the auto raise feature of FvwmAuto so that isn't
a work around. I mucked around the code a bit but it seems once
a window has the focus, fvwm no longer gets notified of ButtonPress 
events in the window. I tried changing lines like
	(win->flags&ClickToFocus) 
to
	(win->flags&(ClickToFocus|SloppyFocus)) 
in several places but to no avail.

One new idea I had is to have the 'Mouse' function take an
additional modifier, 'P', which would signal fvwm that the
event should also be passed on to the event. Therefore, a
line like

Mouse  0   W    AP    Raise

would do exactly what I want.


I also disliked the fact that if a window has SloppyFocus,
both it and its icon will grab the focus when the mouse moves
over it. Therefore, I made the following patch

I apologize if these issues have already been beaten to death.
I didn't see anything in the TO-DO list for 2.0.39 or the last
20 or so postings to this list.

If this is so, this behaviour must have been changed anywhere between version
1.24r to 2.0.x, where the 'GoodStuff'-Module (ancestor of FvwmButtons)
accesses the .fvwmrc file directly, so that a shutdown and restart
of 'GoodStuff' allone will reflect new button definitions in .fvwmrc.

I don't have 2.0.x yet, so it would be kind, if someone could verify
Petes observations.

After fiddling around with the code, I did find a way to get the
click->raise behavior I want with SloppyFocus. I only did it for
Button 1 as I like to use Button 2 to paste in windows without them
getting raised.  Here are the patches I made (also includes the icon
focus patch from my last message). I am sure there are probably ways
of confusing it I haven't found yet, so use at your own risk.

This is all correct, in fvwm-1.xx GoodStuff got the name of a file to read 
from fvwm, and then read it. In fvwm-2.xx FvwmButtons (and other modules)
ask fvwm for the configuration to use. This is because the new configuration
stuff allows you to:
1. Have multiple config files
2. Have configuration entered from the keyboard via FvwmTalk

Unfortunately, you can't enter module configuration from the keyboard 
(I actually am not sure why this is the case.)

That is the case.  Fvwm reads the config files, and the modules get
their config info from fvwm.  The reason being that this is the only
way for modules to deal w/ m4 and cpp preprocessing cleanly.

Granted, if you don't use these (which I don't) then the advantage of
just being able to restart a module and pick up it's new config is
lost.

On the TO-DO list I have plans to update the FvwmTalk module to be
able to accept module config info, which will help here (you can make
small changes on the fly quickly that way).

Or you can put the module config info in a separate file and use the
'Read <file>' command to load the changes without restarting fvwm.

Run xbuffy by itself and use FvwmIdent to find out what the Name (or
Class or Resource) of the window is, and put that (one of those) in
the quotes, if it's not actually "xbuffy".  I'll bet that's the
problem.

i recently moved to 2.0.x and that is the only feature that i mourn.
i have had to restart fvwm to get the new Buttons config to stick.

but i dont change it much so i may live...

I would say that this should be a user-option, not something that always
happens in sloppy-focus mode. I personally would give up on a window
manager that did this to me.

I would say that this should be a user-option, not something that always
happens in sloppy-focus mode. I personally would give up on a window
manager that did this to me.

Hi all,

I noticed something strange that I never expected...can anyone explain this?

I recently downloaded the 3d icons that someone posted to this list about 
2 weeks ago (sorry, forgot the guys name...great work tho!).  I dumped 
the whole lot into my fvwm_icons directory.  I restarted fvwm and  
*immediately* had colormap problems, even though I hadn't changed my 
.fvwm2rc file to make use of the new icons.  I confirmed this was the 
source of the color problems by removing the new icons, restarting fvwm, 
and all was well.

Question: why does fvwm seem to read all the available icons?  Why not 
just read the icons that specified in the .fvwm2rc?

Please note, I'm not bitchin'; this is just a question and I can easily
get around it.  I have trmendous respect for Rob and Charles.  I'd like to
know why fvwm is implemented this way from an Xwindow perspective for my
own edification. 

Thanks,

Bret

The Name and Resource are "xbuffy", while the class is "XBuffy". This
line works as expected:

   *FvwmButtons(2x2) - NULL Swallow "xbuffy" Exec xbuffy -priority 16

and swallows xbuffy for me using 2.0.39 under Solaris-2.3, so Aaron
must have another problem, perhaps platform specific.

When I left it, fvwm only read in the icons for iconfied windows - it
didn't even read icons for everything specified in .fvwmrc. It certainly
doesn't read all available icons.

Perhaps you had one or two really nasty icons.

I start fvwm in my .xinitrc file, and then start several other apps.
I had to stick in a "sleep 6" after starting fvwm.  If I don't, several
of the apps come up with "default" decorations (gray borders, etc.)
instead of decorations controlled by "Style" lines in my .fvwmrc.

Is there a more elegant way to get around this than "sleep 6"?

Hello,

I would have to agree with Rob.  I have several hundred xpm icons in my
directories and I am running on an 8-bit display, so if all of these are
read in then I would absolutely no colors left.
Remove your cons one by one until you find the ones that are causing the
problem.

By the way, Rob, your solution for the Sun IPC's worked fine.  Starting
the X server with the -zaphod worked great.  The sideways page flipping
problem was cured.  However, we noticed that there were two processes of
everything still running, such as two fvwm2 processes and two consoles,
etc.  Once we started fvwm2 with the -s option that was also cured.  It
seems like this is a problem for all Sun IPCs, so it might be helpful
put a note about this in the FAQ's.

Yes.  I and many others have experienced this problem, though Chuck
can't seem to reproduce it.  The ugliest solution, which is the only
one which works, seems to be to put all programs that you wish to start
up in a script and call this script from the Init section in the .fvwmrc
instead of in your .xinitrc.  
The problem becomes even more pronounced on loaded machines.

I think that there exists a serious race condition problem...

Hi all fvwm fans.
I wanted xbiff to show in the buttonbar, however I did not want to have a
separate button to start my mailreader. Plus I wanted to have just as 
beautiful xpm pixmaps as on the other buttons. Well, since I couldn't
find such a program I wrote one myself. Perhaps there is one already, well
here is mine anyway.
-------------------
xpmbiff is a VERY simple mail notification program. It can display    
a colored and shaped window which shows the status of the spoolfile. 
It shows an empty icon if it is empty, otherwise a full icon.            
When you click on the icon it will start a program of your choice,     
probably a mail reader. When the spoolfile increase in size it will  
execute another command of your choice, for example:                  
cat mail.au > /dev/audio                                             

I have typed this in my fvwmrc file:
...
Style "xpmbiff"	   NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0, StaysOnTop
...
*FvwmButtons - Whatever       Swallow "xpmbiff" Exec bin/xpmbiff 
bin/bitmaps/ettbrev.xpm bin/bitmaps/flerabrev.xpm 3 'xterm -e pine &' 
'cat /usr/local/hacks/sounds/effects/youvegotmail.au > /dev/audio' &
...

xpmbiff is in $HOME/bin the bitmaps in $HOME/bin/bitmaps

This is the first version, try it and use it if you like. Please mail me 
any comments and suggestions. It is made for being swallowed by GoodStuff
that is why it sets its position to 2000,2000. The pixmaps have to be
the same size.

(I hope I am not filling anybodys spoolfile with this uuencode.
 If I am, mail me and I won't do this ever again.
 Where is the best ftp site to put this?)

Oups, the time specified when I started the xpmbiff was too low
to be nice to the filesystem. An increase to 60 seconds is recomended.

That was a pretty small archive; things like that aren't a problem.  Big
binaries aren't a good idea, though.

You can upload things to ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/incoming/fvwm.  You should
heed the message you get there and inform fvwm-owner@hpc.uh.edu when you've
uploaded files so that they can be moved.  Otherwise nobody can download
them.

Sounds like it.  You might need to grab the waders and muck around in
${OPENWINHOME}/lib/config to fix the problem.

I had the same problem with NetBSD/i386.  I just patched fvwm.c to remove
the basename reference.

The output looks like:

fvwm:  Unknown option:  `--bleck'

Fvwm Version 2.0.39 Usage:

  ./fvwm [-d dpy] [-debug] [-f config_cmd] [-s] [-blackout] [-version] [-h]

My best guess is:  It would have trimmed the directory ("./") out.
Nothing major, just a cosmetic change.

Looks like libgen (libgen.h, -lgen) handles this in solaris, and libutil
(util.h (?), -lutil) in others (linux?).  (Mebbe, lots of speculation here)
Of which, neither exist in a base NetBSD system.

I had another complaint, tho.. (a minor nag).. can we use a fully-qualified
directory name in the distribution tarball?  fvwm/foo, as compared to
fvwm-2.0.39/foo, is highly annoying when I want to keep at least one old
revision around.

Otherwise, keep up the good work.

Hi there,

  I recently installed fvwm2.0.39 on my system (Linux 
1.3.31/XFree3.1.2/ELF) using the sources found on sunsite.unc.edu.
After compiling/installing fvwm I noticed that FvwmWinList doesn't manage 
to keep the window list in the lower left corner, where I wanted the list 
to be. Most times windows become added to or removed from the list, the 
whole winlist moves a few pixels (usually up & left).

  Is this a known problem? Are there any fixes as of yet? Have others 
also noticed this?

yours,
	Benedikt

I'm looking for a quick course to get fvwm (1.x or 2.x) up and running on 
SCO's Open Server 3.0, a SYSV, not bsd based system.

Is there a site with precompiled or configured source files for fvwm on 
SCO? I know some people are using it, but I haven't been able to find any 
sites.

I've downloaded 2.0.39 at this point and gotten fvwm2 to compile and 
seems to run, but when I start X, my /usr/lib/X11/sys.startxrc points to 
fvwm2 intead of mwm, but I get no actions: The screen stays grey and no 
mouse actions are available.

I'm also getting compile errors with FvwmBanner and FvwmPrompt.. so its 
not a complete compile so far..

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

ps. if there's a faq and I haven't seen it, sorry, point me to it!

Yes, fvwm still starts one window manager per screen. If you really
don't have/want two screens, you should start fvwm with "fvwm -s".
-s stands for single screen.

Doesn't exist any more.  It was decided that it didn't need to
interface to the window manager as it didn't buy you anything, plus
xfm(?) did a better job.

Hi everybody.	(Great job done, Rob & Chuck, THANX !!!!!)

I've been using fvwm1.24 for more than a year.
Then I recently heard of fvwm2 development, and tried it out.
Here're the notes I took, while installing (took some days).
I installed fvwm in a local (home directory) subtree.


1) while building FVWM2 (sun IPC Solaris 1.4.3), I had some problems.

    o	first fvwm didn't link, because it couldn't find libxpm.a 
	(in /XTech/lib/X11 on our sun, don't know if this is a non-standard
	installation) adding this directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH worked.

    o	then there was the basename problem (which I edited out).

    o	gcc gave the following warnings.

	    FvwmIconBox.c: In function `main':
	    FvwmIconBox.c:221: warning: passing arg 1 of `XFree' from
		incompatible pointer type
	    FvwmIconBox.c: In function `Loop':
	    FvwmIconBox.c:459: warning: passing arg 1 of `XFree' from
		incompatible pointer type
	    FvwmIconBox.c: In function `freeitem':
	    FvwmIconBox.c:2304: warning: passing arg 1 of `XFree' from
	    incompatible pointer type

	    FvwmPrompt.c: In function `main':
	    FvwmPrompt.c:66: warning: assignment makes pointer from
		integer without a cast


	    GrabWindow.c: In function `Loop':
	    GrabWindow.c:594: warning: passing arg 1 of `XFree' from
	   	incompatible pointer type
	    GrabWindow.c: In function `GrabWindow':
	    GrabWindow.c:859: warning: passing arg 1 of `XFree' from
		incompatible pointer type

	after changing the install paths to a local tree (~albrecht/bin)

	    install -c -m 0755 fvwmrc_convert /XTech"/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2"
	    install: /XTech/usr/lib/X11/fvwm2: No such file or directory
	    *** Error code 1
	    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'
	    Current working directory /home/vta_host/albrecht/fvwm/utils
	    *** Error code 1
	    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `install'
	    Exit 1


    o	/XTech is the value of DESTDIR.
	When I changed this to a local path, I got:

	    make: Fatal error: Don't know how to make target
	    `/net/vta_host/home/vta_host/albrecht/lib/libXext.a'

	since this one is from /XTech/lib

	I think, source libraries shouldn't be refererenced via DESTDIR.


    o	fvwmrc_convert needs gawk (not installed here), does it depend
	on gnu specific functions, or can one also use awk.
	(it's too late for me, I converted by hand)


2) after fvwm2 was up & running, I got the following errors, I couldn't
	explain/fix

    o	fvwm: ColormapFocus requires 1 arg: FollowsFocus or FollowsMouse
	I don't know what's wrong - the line looks like:
	ColormapFocus		followsfocus
	(I also tried capitalized FollowsFocus)

	now that I`ve done several other things to my .fvwm2rc, this
	message has vanished mysteriously.

    o	the following is not the fault of fvwm, but hostname doesn't
	return the full address for our domain:
		17:16 ~> hostname
		vta_host
		17:27 ~>
	while the full name is vta_host.auto.tuwien.ac.at

	$HOSTDISPLAY seems to get its value from hostname, so I can't
	use it for what it's intended for. (I work around with sth.
	like -display ${HOST}.auto.tuwien.ac.at for remote xterms.

    o	menues created with
		AddToMenu "name"
		+ 	"xxx"	tilte
	display with a nop "" line on top
	(ok, I RTFM'd, but I'd like this style more - better overview)

	menus without title have an empty half line at the top, if the
	first menu item isn't specified on the same line (i.e with a
	\n+... )
	
    o	Also I cant get the doubleclick function of "menu" to work.
	*FvwmButtons -	   xterm.xpm	Menu Xterms	Exec xterm
		-title $HOST -display $HOSTDISPLAY &    


	In Fvwm1 I used the following undocumented "feature":

	Function "DoorQuit"
		Exec		"Motion"	exec @@
		Quit 		"Click"
	EndFunction

	*TermStuff Door	   Door.xpm	Function "DoorQuit"

	the first click was consumed by Termstuff, then if a second 
	"single Click" followed, it would quit or otherwise execute
	the command @@ (door opener) after the motion-timeout.
	(immediate was not usable, and using doubleClick resulted in a
	triple-click needed, but then Click wouldn't work any more)

	BTW: Is there any way to have the left mouse button bound to a
	different function than the right (or middle) one?

	How can I possibly get the following behaviour:

		I press the mouse button on a FvwmButton button and
			move the mouse  -> popup menu (for fast
							selection) 
		I click -> menu (stays up, for novices)
		I DoubleClick -> another function
		
	possibly with different functions/menus on the different mouse
	buttons. 

	I'd like to specify sothing along this lines:

	AddToFunc "Button1"
	+	mouse-1-Motion		popup Xterms
	+	mouse-1-Click		menu Xterms
	+	mouse-1-DoubleClick	exec xterm &
	+	mouse-2-Motion		popup Tools
	+	mouse-2-Click		menu Tools
	+	mouse-2-DoubleClick	TogglePage


	*TermStuff xterms xterm.xpm Function Button1

3) Could someone, who's an expert in fvwm2 syntax please reread the
	manual?  The mix of fvwm and fvwm2 style definitions is rather
	confusing:  

	e.g: the popup example seems to be a leftover from robs fvwm1:

                Popup "Utilities"
                    Title   "Utilities"
                    Exec    "Xterm"         exec xterm &
                    Exec    "Rxvt"          exec rxvt &
                    Exec    "Top"           exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top &
                    Exec    "Calculator"    exec xcalc &
                    Exec    "Xman"          exec xman &
                    Exec    "Xmag"          exec xmag &
                    Nop     ""
                    Popup   "Exit Fvwm"     Quit-Verify
                EndPopup

	I figured that this is not legal any more: As I read it,
	popups are defined via AddToMenu and are only called via "PopUp"
	instead of "Menu".

	I think there are more leftovers, (which I just didn't
	recognize as such)

When I "identify" fvwmButton, it says Gravity: SouthEast
When I "identify any application, it seems to tell me in which quarter
of the screen  the center of the window is.

What is this for?
I always thought this was an fvwm internal hint where to place new
windows of that class.
No wonder, I never found a palce to adjust this.

SloppyFocus is only mentioned at the beginning.
it doesn't even appear in the description of the style command.

Since it seems that no one has reproduced the bug I was seeing, here
is both an improved procedure for seeing the problem, and the fix.

Please try this out if you are so inclined.  It would be nice if someone
was able to reproduce the problem and verify that the patch fixes it.

To recap: Any window that fvwm places with SmartPlacement and
RandomPlacement will exhibit this behavior:  when fvwm is first restarted
after window creation, that window will move slightly.


How to reproduce the "Windows Move Across Restart" bug.

1. Create simple demonstration control files (.xinitrc and .fvwm2rc)

   a. .xinitrc contents:

      #!/bin/sh
      fvwm2 &
      # sleep to be sure fvwm starts before xterm starts
      sleep 2
      exec xterm -C -title CONSOLE

   b. ~/.fvwm2rc contents:

      Create ~/.fvwm2rc from the default system.fvwmrc and change the
      "ActivePlacement" style default to "RandomPlacement". [And other
      changes as needed for ModulePath or fvwm filename differences.]

2. Start X

3. The "CONSOLE" xterm should be placed at geometry 80x24+1+1.
   Use both xwininfo and FvwmIndent to verify.

4. Restart fvwm from the menu.

5. The "CONSOLE" xterm should have moved to geometry 80x24+0+0.
   Both xwininfo and FvwmIdent should agree.


This "-1,-1" translation is a bug in the placement code that occurs
only if the window is placed with RandomPlacement/SmartPlacement,
and then fvwm is restarted.

The following patch fixes the problem.  The x,y and xdiff,ydiff values
will be recorded similar to the ActivePlacement/SmartPlacement code.

Subject: FVWM: IconBox Style, Meta-Q Command

Under version 1 of fvwm, multiple IconBox'es could be defined and when 
one was full, the next would be used.  i.e.

   IconBox 5  -80 -450 -5
   IconBox 5 -180 -450 -105

I have recently built version 2.0.39 and this feature no longer seems to 
function the same.  I have changed the syntax in the .fvwmrc file 
appropriately to:

   Style "*" IconBox 5  -80 -450 -5
   Style "*" IconBox 5 -180 -450 -105

Now, only the last box defined is used.  When it is full, the icons
annoyingly place themselves in the middle of the screen, but near the
window being iconized.  Is there a way to make IconBox work like version
1?  I experimented with using the FvwmIconBox module, but it seems to show
all icons including those for windows that are open. 

My second question is regarding defining a key to close windows.  I had 
been used to OpenWindows Meta-Q command for closing, so I included:

    Key Q       FTIWS       M      Close

in .fvwmrc.  This didn't work (with the capital Q), but I eventually 
stumbled on

    Key q       FTIWS       M      Close

which does work. I have tried this on both my Linux/XFree86 machines and
my Solaris2.3 SparcStation with the same results.  Is it that X just
defines the Meta keys with the lower case keysymdef's?  I've got it
working, but am just wondering why! 

Any information on these would be appreciated.

Thanks,


Mike

I have observed that this is not true.  If you "Read" a changed
config file, the previously set options aren't reset to the defaults.

In case of FvwmButtons this is a desaster, because after rereading the
config file you will get a button bar that is twice as big, because
every button from the new configuration is ADDED to the old configu-
ration.  Nothing but a restart of Fvwm helps then.

I just tested it to be sure, and guess what I am gonna do next?
Yep, I have to restart fvwm, to get my original button bar back. :-(

Ciao,
 Andy.

Well, not maybe more than you hoped for, how'd you like to have a
window manager (a hack of bowman which is a hack of fvwm) that looks
EXACTLY like fvwm?

I forget who did it, but it is on my web page..

I think you mean win95, right?

Bowman (http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~byang/bowman/) is a hack of fvwm 1.xx
to make it look like the Nexstep window manager, and then there is a
hack to bowman to make it look like (shudder) Windows95.

Todd> I forget who did it, but it is on my web page..

Todd> http://www.cs.umr.edu/~tfries/html.cgi?file=fvwm or =linuxurls
Todd> I forget...

Bowman itself is in:

               ftp://sdphu1.ucsd.edu/pub/byang/bowman/

The win95 patch for bowman is in:

               ftp://ftp.netppl.fi/pub/linux/win95look/

Eventually, changes may be merged into fvwm2 which will allow pixmaps
for buttons and title style changes which will allow you to create a
win95 look with it.

But until then, you'll have to go w/ the hacked bowman if you really
want the win95 look.

Chuck

Apparently not, eh? ;^)

I haven't been doing much of that lately, actually, which I imagine
you noticed from my lack of input to the beta list.  Work has been
pretty hectic (and my activities outside of work too) .  I apologize
for slacking off there and promise to return to beta testing ASAP...

I'm hoping to upgrade my Linux system very shortly to allow me to do
more work on fvwm and XEmacs at home.  I only have about 10Mb to do
development with on my Linux box.  Roomy enough for fvwm, but not for
XEmacs (which I obviously can't even install yet due to the space
constraints).

And since I don't have XEmacs there, I do less work on fvwm at home
than I should...

Nope, unfortunately.  The way the module system is set up, having
modules deal with the menus is difficult (for instance, someone else
wanted the FvwmButton module to be able to popup menus on the
ButtonPress, which doesn't work and I wasn't able to find an easy
fix).  I'd like to try and address this in the future.

Actually, you should be able to do it using a function.  Yup - I just
did the following in my .fvwm2rc:

------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse 2 R MC DynamicMenu

AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title

AddToFunc DynamicMenu "I" DestroyMenu "DMenu"
+ "I" Read .fvwm2rc-dynmenu
+ "I" Popup DMenu
------------------------------------------------------------

So Alt-Control Middle mouse button rereads the .fvwm2rc-dynmenu file
which was just:

------------------------------------------------------------
AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title
+ "Rlogin" Module FvwmForm Rlogin
------------------------------------------------------------

Then I changed .fvwm2rc-dynmenu to:

------------------------------------------------------------
AddToMenu DMenu "Dynamic Menu" Title
+ "Rlogin" Module FvwmForm Rlogin
+ "QuitVerify" Module FvwmForm QuitVerify
------------------------------------------------------------

And hit Alt-Control Middle again.  Changed Immediately.

This sounds like a good thing to add to the FAQ or to the sample rc
file.  I'll copy the FVWM mailing list on this reply too, since there
may be others out there who'd like to do this.

Hope I've been of assistance,
(the other) Chuck

ps - An unrelated subject.  Someone should put the latest precompiled
linux version of XEmacs out on sunsite so it makes it into the next
round of CDROMs that go out.  They all seem to have just lemacs-19.10.
Time to get the Linux community upgraded!

I've just had a look at Bowman and the bowman95 thing. They do look
really good, but I still like fvwm. Would it be possible to use Bowman's
code to get the title bars to contain those nice little icons. Also
Bowman's icons are mounted in a very nice way. Would it be possible to
add an icon style that allows icons to look the way they do in Bowman,
whilst still retaining fvwm handling of icons.
I think Bowman is a very good effort and it would be great to include an
option to compile bowman instead of fvwm, if Bowman could be brought up
to date with fvwm2.

Graeme McCaffery
P.S. I reckon Bowman is a very good name for a program.

It is already there.  CHeck /pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/xemacs.  :)

One quick question about fvwm.  Have you ever considered embedding some
more general purpose scripting language into fvwm?  It already does a lot
of things that seem similar, and from 1.?? to 2.??? it seemed to get more
substantial (the pseudo-scripting language).

I was just playing with gwm, and it was nice being able to define arbitrary
commands, but gwm is broken in a number of ways, and the psuedo-lisp it uses
is missing quite a few things.

thanks foe the time

i'm using fvwm 2.0.39, under DEC ultrix 4.3, and whenever i try to load
xpaint, i get:

12:24pm <help> [~]% xpaint
X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)

xpaint works fine with mwm...anybody else experience this, or better

I did read your note when it came in and started to look into some of
the problems (like the coredump on $9), and I remember someone else
responding to some of the other ones.  I thought I had responded to
it, but apparently not.

I beg your forgiveness, as I have been terribly busy lately.  If a
note takes only a few seconds to investigate and respond to, I try and
respond right away, but if it takes a little while then my real work
obviously takes precedence and sometimes I forget to return to looking
into the problems.  Since your note was so long and covered some non
obvious problems, it fell into the latter category.

I'm sure I've unintentionally slighted a few people this way, and I
apologize to you (especially since this is like the 2nd or third time
I've lost track of one of your's) and to anyone else who thinks I'm
just discarding or ignoring their notes.

I came back from lunch early, so I'll respond right now:

Yes, if I ever forget to respond, please give me a gentle nudge after
a few weeks by resending any reports...

Andy> So, here is a recompilation of my reports/requests:

Andy> 1.) .fvwm2rc:
Andy>     I get a coredump right after fvwm2 starts, when I ask for this:
Andy>  AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9

Andy>     But it works fine when I ask for this:
Andy>  AddToFunc XSETROOT_b "I" exec xsetroot -bitmap $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8

Andy>     I checked the man page for fvwm2 and it says $0 - $9 is fine, though.

I started looking into this problem.  The 'expand' routine which
handles these looks for 0-9 as being valid, but it's referencing a
passed in value by this.  If that passed in value isn't allocated as
10 char *'s, there could be trouble.  I'm looking through the code
again right now...  Oooh.  I think I found the problem.  In
functions.c in ExecuteFunction, it resets the 'arguments' array so all
of it's members are NULL, sort of:

  char *arguments[10];

  for(j=0;j<9;j++)
    arguments[j] = NULL;

It's forgetting to reset the last one ([9])...  If you try changing
this to:

  char *arguments[10];

  for(j=0;j<10;j++)
    arguments[j] = NULL;

Your coredump should go away, I believe.  Not every system will have
this problem, as some of them will automatically set those values to
be NULL.  Your system probably isn't one of these...  I've fixed this
for the next release.

Andy> 2.) FvwmWinList:
Andy>     *truncateleft doesn't work.  It still truncates right.

I recall the author of FvwmWinList responding to this himself.  I
believe his response was that it should be *FvwmWinListTruncateLeft,
and that it worked for him locally.

Andy> 3.) FvwmTalk:
Andy>     It doesn't accept module specifications like "*FvwmWinListUseIconNames"
Andy>     The error message is:
Andy>       "No such module /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2 *FvwmWinListUseIconNames"

This has been on the TO-DO list for a while, I believe, in the
Bugfixes section:

  - Increase FvwmTalk capabilities (like module config options)

Andy> 4.) Okay, here is a tricky one:
Andy>     In my .fvwm2rc I got:
Andy>  Key Up          A       SC      CursorMove  0 -1
Andy>  Key Down        A       SC      CursorMove  0 +1
Andy>  Key Up          A       SM      CursorMove  0  -10
Andy>  Key Down        A       SM      CursorMove  0  +10

Andy>     This works beautifully, unless a (popup) menu is open.  In that
Andy>     case Shift-Control-<cursor> (and even Shift-<cursor>) acts just
Andy>     like Shift-Meta-<cursor>.  Apparently the Meta-Flag is set while
Andy>     a menu is open.  Strange.
Andy>     Control-<cursor> also moves the cursor, but it seems like in
Andy>     tenths of a step.

When menus are poped up, they intercept arrow keys and (interestingly
enough) Emacs like key sequences for cursor movement.  I don't know if
this is documented anywhere though.  I'll have to check.

Andy> 5.) This is not a bug, but two questions:
Andy>     a) Did fvwm1's 'Cursor' command disappear completely, or is it
Andy>        just hidden somewhere?  If it's gone, why?

Yes it's gone.  The TO-DO list has plans to ressurect it.  Don't know
why it dissappeared.

Andy>     b) What about fvwm1's commands "AppsBackingStore" and "BackingStore"?
Andy>        Are they gone, too?  Why?

Again, not sure why.  My first guess would be the lack of Style flags
available, so some stuff had to be sacrificed.  There isn't a lot of
code associated with these, so they could probably be brought back
after the seemingly mythical Style flags code rewrite that I keep
mentioning...

Also, using BackingStore does eat a lot of extra memory, I believe.

Andy> 6.) Another question, but more tricky I am afraid:
Andy>     How can I specify that an iconified FvwmPager always opens up
Andy>     at -1+1 ?  In order to simulate the old builtin pager, I got this:
Andy>  AddToFunc InitFunction    "I" Module FvwmPager 0 1
Andy>  *FvwmPagerHilight lightsteelblue
Andy>  *FvwmPagerGeometry -1+1
Andy>  *FvwmPagerLabel 0 Standard
Andy>  *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Extended
Andy>  *FvwmPagerSmallFont 5x8
Andy>  *FvwmPagerDeskTopScale 35
Andy>  *FvwmPagerStartIconic

Andy>     It starts up iconic, just like I want to have it, but of course
Andy>     it always shows up where all the other icons are, too.  But I
Andy>     want to have it at the upper right corner.  Is that possible?

Use the Style command to give it it's own IconBox to place it there,
would be the easiest way.

Andy> 7.) I would like to second the wish for "OpaqueResize" and for
Andy>     "TogglePage" and my personal wish would be a window-specific
Andy>     AutoRaise command/module, like a style-command or so.

All basically on the TO-DO list already.

Andy> 8.) Still playing around with fvwm 2.0.38 I found that the behavior
Andy>     of complex functions is a little different than what I was used
Andy>     to from fvwm 1.24r.  I have the following function defined:

Andy>  AddToFunc WindowOps-or-Kill      "M" Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
Andy>  +                                "C" Menu Window-Ops2 Nop
Andy>  +                                "D" Delete
Andy>  +                                "D" Close
Andy>  +                                "D" Destroy

Andy>     What I thought this would do when I double click is this:
Andy>      1.) try to Delete the window
Andy>      2.) if 1.) failed try to Close the window
Andy>      3.) if 2.) failed also, Destroy the window.

Andy>     But what happens is that the window always gets destroyed.
Andy>     Is this a bug or a feature?  If it's a feature would it be
Andy>     possible to make this behavior optional?

I'll have to look into this a little further.  It sounds like a
reasonable request, but I don't know how easy it'll be.

Andy> 9.) There is a DestroyMenu for re-defining Menus and Functions, which
Andy>     is a very nice feature.  Now I was wondering whether something
Andy>     similar can be done with module options?  Something like
Andy>     DestroyModule, to get back to the default behavior of the module?
Andy>     (I am not talking about KillModule)

This might be possible.  I'll add it to the TO-DO list.

Andy>     Since it's not possible to supply module options in FvwmTalk, it's
Andy>     necessary to restart fvwm2 whenever I changed something in my
Andy>     FvwmButtons.  That's too bad, since I can redefine everything
Andy>     else, like menus, funcs, etc.

See my response to #3 above.

Andy> 10) In a recent posting, Makoto 'MAR_kun' MATSUSHITA wrote that there are
Andy>     a few FVWM modules out there which are not part of the standard
Andy>     distribution (FvwmAdlLog, FvwmIconMan-0.2, FvwmWish-0.8,

I don't have all of these, but I do have some.  I don't plan on
putting them into the distribution just yet, but I would like to put
pointers to all of them in the FAQ until I decide to put some of them
into the distribution.  If someone knows where any or all of these
reside, please mail me the locations!

With a little magic help from sed, someone could turn this into the
often requested "menu that shows all executables in a directory":

In .fvwmrc

AddToMenu DMenu "Programs" Title
Mouse 1	R   	S       DynamicMenu

AddToFunc DynamicMenu "I" DestroyMenu "DMenu"
+	"I" 	AddToMenu DMenu "Programs" Title

+	"I"	read .fvwm2rc-dynmenu2
+	"I"	Popup DMenu

and the file sesc is a sed script:

h
G
s/ */+  "/
s:\n:" exec bin/:

Cool man! But,
1. It seems pretty useless, unless you've got a bunch of programs
that are graphical and don't need any arguments.
2. I think there's a race condition between doing the exec
and the read. As I recall, "exec" always background tasks, so there's
no way to make sure its done before doing the read.

Yup.  I have considered this (for version 3 though, not version 2),
but I don't know yet.

I want to keep fvwm as small as possible while making (keeping) it
powerful.  By adding and modifying the existing rc file format, I
should be able to add a lot of functionality without bloating it, but
a somewhat standard language would be nice too.

I've been meaning to look at that.  I've had the tar file sitting in
my directories for quite a while.  Just out of curiousity mostly.

I like having the emacs-lisp capabilities for XEmacs, but I think that
might be overkill for a window manager, especially with the module
interface that fvwm has.

No problem, but it's definitely time for me to return to my regularily
scheduled work...

True.

But perhaps some more usefull ideas could be derived from this.  Use a
sed/awk/perl command to build up a menu that has function calls and
passing in the found filenames, for things like:

  - a menu of background files (and the function invokes xv on them).
  - to get all of the modes from the current version of xlock
    dynamically so you don't have to update your menu every time a new
    version comes out.
  - a list of files in a directory that you freqently edit to pop them
    up in your favorite editor (perhaps XEmacs & gnuclient to put them
    into your currently running XEmacs).

Ah.  Hadn't thought about that...

I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a solution to that.
Like an Exec variant that puts it into the background so we don't lock
up fvwm, but monitors the child to see if it's still alive and have a
Wait variant that waits for the last Exec'd child to finish.  I'll
have to look into something like that.

Hi all, 

  I think I found a bug in fvwm. I have the action connect with mouse
button 1 on the title bar in the following way:

AddToFunc "Move-or-Raise" "I" Raise
+              "M" Move
+              "D" RaiseLower

Mouse 1         TS      A       Function "Move-or-Raise"

and I noted a strange behaviour. The thing seem to work well most of
the time: if I simply click, window is raised; if I click and move, 
window follow mouse, and If I double click a RaiseLower is performed.
If I click without releasing the mouse, cursor change sto a dot, and
after a while it changes again in the four-arrows one, and Move is
performed until the mouse release. But... if I release the mouse an
instant after or before (I cannot understand well) the change from 
dot to arrows of the cursor, then the window will follow the mouse as I 
had done a "Move" from an external menu, I mean it follows my mouse
with all the buttons released. Hope you understand this... my English
is very poor since I learned Spanish.
(well, it is not so simple obtain the right timing, but it happens 
to me often without searching it, and today I finally understood how
to reproduce it) 

Fvwm is 2.0.39, compiled on a Linux 2.1.13/a.out box, X11R6.

Hope this helps, and... really a cool WM!

How about TCL?.  FVWM modules could communicate with fvwm via TCL, and
if you throw in Tk's window stuff, it could get interesting.  I'm sure
others have thought of this.  Of course, this might blow the
small-is-beautiful thing...

Hrm, cool...just don't forget that an obvious timesaver and 'intelligent'
thing to do would be to compare the timestamp of the subdir and the
timestamp of the 'dynamic menu' and only when they are different
(i.e. the subdir has new info in it) do we need to create a new
dynamic menu.  This is a subtle, but time-saving function.

This error occurs with xpaint because you don't have enough colors left in
your colormap -- which is more likely because of fvwm's use of pixmaps,
etc. than if you were using mwm.  Get rid of your colorful background or
whatever for a sec, and it'll help.  I promise.

There is a  tcl/tk library which allows tcl/tk hooks into FVWM.  Mark 
Crimmins' TkGoodstuff is an excellent example of this libraries' effectiveness.

Sender: owner-fvwm@hpc.uh.edu
Precedence: bulk

X-Majordomo: 1.92

Hello Everyone,

Well, I have designed a function that will allow a user to change
backgrounds from a menu, whether it be a texture with xpmroot, image
with xv, or solid color with xsetroot.  The function automatically
generates a background file and it will retain the chosen backgrounds
even if fvwm2 is exited.  However, I am missing one essential
ingredient.   IS THERE ANY WAY TO OBTAIN THE VALUE OF THE CURRENT
DESKTOP?  There is no way to continue this endeavor without this value. 
There must a variable that retains this value.  If not, is there an easy
patch to FvwmBacker module?

Can anyone help me out here?  CHUCK HINES?  ROBERT NATION?  TODD FRIES? ANYONE?



Thanks,

Chad

If you have interested Cursor implementation, check your old mail (if
you have any). Kit Smithers <Kits@bertley.demon.co.uk> posted patch to
this mailing list (exactly speaking, fvwm@wonderland.org) in May/1995.

Let me summarize modules which is *not* included fvwm distribution.

Name: FvwmAdlLog
Version: V1.2 (???)
Feature: Logging users behavior

Name: FvwmIconMan
Version: 0.2
Feature: Just like twm's IconManager.

Name: FvwmWish
Version: 0.8
Feature: Tcl/Tk interface to fvwm

Name: fvwish
Version: 1.0
Feature: Tcl/Tk interface to fvwm

Name: tkfvwm
Version: 0.5 (maybe)
Feature: Tcl/Tk interface to fvwm

Name: tkgoodstuff
Version: 4.1b3 (4.1b4 in-progress)
Feature: Like GoodStuff but not only modules. Use tkfvwm.

I know where to get (except FvwmWish), and put these on my archive.

May I send the information of localtion, Chuck ?

I like this idea too; it could help with a general configuration tool for
fvwm.  (Kudos to the author of the "Braindead" config program)

Does fvwm block on a fifo read?  Wouldn't writing the output to a fifo and
have fvwm read from that fifo do the trick?  You'd probably have to write
a simple little launch program to check that fvwm is currently reading
from the fifo before letting you're real "script" pump output into it.
Comments?

Well, once we do a stable release we'll probably put binaries for several
platforms at the FTP site.  For someone to help you now, though, you'll
have to at least tell us what kind of machine you have and what operating
system it's running.  Unless, of course, we have any psychics on the list.

I posted a CursorStyle patch a while back. But it doesnt seem to have made it
into patch level 19. So at the risk of repeating myself, here's another copy.
Although this one fixes the stupid mistakes I made in the first one...

BTW: Whats the best way to submit patches for fvwm? And to whom?

The idea is to allow you to change the cursors used by fvwm. For example I
prefer the more Mwm like:

CursorStyle SYS XC_left_ptr
CursorStyle Destroy XC_left_ptr
CursorStyle Title_Cursor XC_left_ptr
CursorStyle Menu XC_arrow

Possible things to change the cursor for are:

POSITION DEFAULT SYS TITLE_CURSOR MOVE MENU WAIT SELECT DESTROY LEFT RIGHT TOP
BOTTOM TOP_LEFT TOP_RIGHT BOTTOM_LEFT BOTTOM_RIGHT

To install the patch use (something like):

uudecode patchmail
uncompress cursorstyle.patch.gz
cd <fvwm path>/fvwm
patch <cursorstyle.patch

Otherwise use whatever method you can for installing the changes from a context
style diff.

begin 664 cursorstyle.patch.gz

Surely this is a fault of xpaint then?  If you load the file from the menu
it works fine, so I assume that *xpaint* has a bug with startup and
bad colourmap configuration.
Is this so?  (If true,

Yup.  This is a known bug and it annoys me constantly.  From the
Bugfixes section of the TO-DO list:

  - Change Motion vs Click to be calculated via a MotionThreshold instead
    of a timeout (timeout should only be for Click vs DoubleClick)

Which actually could be spelled out a little better.  It should be
more like:

  - Change Motion vs Click vs DoubleClick to be calculated via a
    MotionThreshold and ClickTime:
        MotionThreshold exceeded -> Motion
        MotionThreshold not exceeded & ClickTime exceeded -> Click
        MotionThreshold not exceeded & ClickTime not exceeded -> DoubleClick

It will be fixed eventually.

Romano> Fvwm is 2.0.39, compiled on a Linux 2.1.13/a.out box, X11R6.

Romano> Hope this helps, and... really a cool WM!

I'm glad you're enjoying it.

I don't believe that there is currently any way to get the current
desktop number.

But it could be added as an additional variable available to
functions.  Just some additional code added to 'expand' in complex.c.
I'll put it on the TO-DO list.

Its not up to me to decide what is included in fvwm, but I always
kept the tcl/tk stuff separate from fvwm, just because tcl/tk is a big
package, and not everyone uses it.

Its hard enough to explain to people that they need xpm; adding a
requirement for tcl/tk would just make it worse.

I guess that these packages should be available at the same site/location
as fvwm, but either a separate package, or something that is not compiled by
default.

This may sound stupid, but when everyone wants to have a different border
style, can we make the border of Fvwm a separate module? In that case,
people can write something like FvwmBorder, FvwmWin95Border, and
FvwmMacBorder. 

The Style command would be: FvwmWin95Border*style "xterm" "...." or maybe

Style "xterm" FvwmWin95Border, Color....
Style "Emacs" FvwmMacBorder, Color...

Then we don't have to hack around the source code... I am not familiar
with programming a window manager, if you find my idea stupid, please say
so. 

Eventually, we can have an object hierarchy, a FvwmBorder class, who knows
how to interact with the core Fvwm, and other Border classes derived from
there.

It would be convenient if contributed packages were mirrored at the fvwm
site but not essential. Please *don't* include things like the tcl/tk
stuff in the main distribution because it would make it much bigger to
download.

*Do* include a list of pointers to other packages though. If people want
the other stuff we can get it so long as we know where to look.

It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but there are some potential
problems with this:

  1) Potential for very slow response on redraws if modules muck with
     borders and such.
  2) Modules don't know about a lot of the internals like this, which
     would require big rewrites in the module communicaion code.
  3) We can't please everyone without causing fvwm to really bloat.

But actually I would like to allow modules to get info about the
windows that could possibly allow them to muck with the titlebars and
such.  From the TO-DO list:

  - Add to module commincations to pass titlebar & button window ids to
    allow modules to muck with those windows (for animation, or whatever)?

I'm not sure if this is entirely feasable, but I'd like to give it a
shot sometime in the future.

And #3 is always my biggest concern.  Fvwm is supposed to be small,
fast, flexible, and powerful, and there are tradeoffs that have to be
made sometimes.  One of the main reasons why I don't want to put a lot
of Windows95 (or MacOS or whatever) lookalike stuff in the main module
unless it's really generically applicable and not a resource hog.

Perhaps I should put a statement to that effect in the FAQ, eh?

How about being able to define a pattern in a similar way as we do 
for titlebar buttons with ButtonStyle?

Hmmm, the same code could be reused to produce a pattern of the same
dimensions as a button, which would then be tiled along the length
of the titlebar.

And, if we wanna describe fvwm's configuration in Tcl (Tk needed?), we
can make a module named FvwmTcl, just like FvwmM4/FvwmCpp, I believe.

Yes, it's the fault (and a well-known one) of xpaint, not of fvwm.  I don't
remember why it hasn't been addressed -- perhaps he is no longer
maintaining it?

Hi All-


I've been fooling around with tkgoodstuff.  I've been having some
problems. I wonder if anyone has suggestions about how to get it to
work. Unfortunately I am not familiar with tcl/Tk.  I am sure that
would help.

Thanks

I am able to run it with minimal as the config file via FvwmTalk
as Module tkgoodstuff -f /usr/local/lib/tkgooodstuff/sample-rc/minimal

It returns the following log :

Call me crazy, but I had more of a 'generic' idea of how one could configure
boarders.

When you get right down to it, there are some basic things that make 'boarders'
look like olvwm, fvwm, mwm, os/2, win95, mac, nextstep, etc.

So, if we could have the following controls over the boarderstyles:

boarderwidth... this would have to be independently controllable up down right & left
cornerdecoration.. either a symmetrically mirrored bitmap, 'dot configuration' such
                   as the current 'buttons' are, or independently configurable top
		   and bottom
boardershadowwidth
boarderhilightwidth
buttonstyle ... this would have to be configurable as either the current 'dot'
                notation, as a bitmap, and also as an indented (i.e. macos) button,
		or an 'extending' (i.e. nextstep button).
titlebarstyle .. this would have to be the current 'bulgy' look, or the
                 'flat encompassing the buttons' nextstep/win95 look,
		 or optionally allow a 'pixmap' to be displayed over a certain
		 length, so as to 'force' certain appearances..i.e. the 'mac'
		 style titlebar
colors for the boarder, boarderhilight, boardershadow...maybe colors for the 
                button hilights would allow for the above mentioned 'indented'
		vs 'extending' buttons
'capture' something in a button... this is a strange contortion of what FvwmButtons
               does, i.e. run and capture, say, 'FvwmIconDisplay' for every
	       app that runs, and then it can display a miniturized app icon in
	       one of the buttons on the title bar...
cursorlook     this would need to be able to change the cursor when it is over
               the boarder vs the corners (i.e. olvwm's circle at the corner)
menuloook      yes, the menus should have their own little styles to them..
               'ctrl3d' for win95'ish, 'plain black on white' for macos look,
	       'pop-off actions align to the top of the menu' for nextstep look,
	       'plain and boring' for win311 type look, '3d' for OS/2 look,
	       etc...this should be on a 'per windowstyle basis'.  I KNOW this
	       seems to be alot of bloat.  I guess definately for a module, eh?

Now I don't pretend to know how to implement all of this, or whether it goes in
the window manager, or if it goes in a module.  If it did go in a module, that
module would either have to be started per window opened (ugh...NO! bad idea!)
or be able to manage all of the different windows, and if the module were not
present, fvwm would then revert back to it's primitive window decorations.

But, what I am asking, is...would the above 'boarderstyle' attributes be
all that is needed in order to provide Fvwm the flexibility to make each window
independently look like 'any os' the user desires?

BTW, for those of you not following the 'wine' development project for Linux, they
just added a '-managed' command line option to wine, which allows the program
to act like an X app and instead of the 'windows' decorations around it, it makes
the X window manager 'manage' the app...it would be hilarious (in my warped sense
of humr) if one could do a win95/win311 'boarderstyle' to Fvwm...this would really
screw with people.

One thing that would help, instead of having pages and pages of:

Style "thisapp" boarderwidth 4,boardershadowwidth 2,boarderhiligytwith 0,.....
Style "thatapp" boarderwidth 4,boardershadowwidth 2,boarderhiligytwith 0,.....
Style "theotherapp" boarderwidth 4,boardershadowwidth 2,boarderhiligytwith 0,.....

all being eactly the same, would be to have 'recursion' in style commands...
something like:

Style "Win95_Look" blah...blah...define a few styles for win95look
Style "Win95_Look" define more styles for win95look
Style "Win95_Look" define even more styles for win95look
Style "Win95_Look" define the rest of the styles for win95look
Style "wordpad"  UseStyle Win95_Look
Style "Solitare" UseStyle Win311_Look
Style "rxvt"     UseStyle Mwm
Style "xterm"    UseStyle Olvwm
Style "Fvwm*"    UseStyle Fvwm  # Just outt'a curiosity, what WOULD the fvwm style
                                # be if we can do all of the above? <grin>

You get the picture.. I assume (hope, maybe I'll hack it tonight) that this would
not be a hard thing to do.  But boy, would it be a useful thing.

Please, comment on my above suggestion as to 'boarderstyle' decorations...
Did I miss anything?

Yes, it's the fault (and a well-known one) of xpaint, not of fvwm.  I don't
remember why it hasn't been addressed -- perhaps he is no longer
maintaining it?

Hi,

Is it possible to force positioning of iconified windows in a manner similar
to HP VUE?  I'd like to force icons to be in specific areas of the screen, in
neatly arranged columns.  For this, I would have to use specific icons for all
windows i.e. all icons are the same size.  If a user tries to move that icon
to an "invalid" position on the grid, the icon would be placed on the closest
"valid" position.  A snap-into-place type thing if you will.

Thanks in advance.

I've had similar (but simpler) thoughts from time to time.  But it
always just seems to be a lot of overkill.  What I would perhaps like
to implement:

  - control over 3d look of borders (like width of shadow)
  - separate control over border width and control handle width
  - titlesytles like flat, sunk, raised, & justification controls
  - Xpm/bitmaps for buttons
  - cursorstyle patch (perhaps modified for use in Style commands to
    make it per window?)

This should allow you to get relatively close to looking like pretty
much any window border look you want.  I don't feel that FVWM should
have to be able to look exactly like any other window manager type
program down to the exact pixel.  If you can get close, that's good.
This approach shouldn't bloat fvwm too badly, and a lot of that list

Comments?  Anyone think I'm way off base with that?

Again, just like above, I don't think that FVWM should have to have 10
different menu styles to look like 10 different window managers.
Perhaps some more generic controls though could be thought up to make
it customizable though.  I haven't given as much thought to this as to
the borders/titles "problem".

A module that has it's own menuing system that sends the commands to
FVWM instead of asking FVWM to put up the menus is an excellent idea
though.  Then you could make 10 different modules if you wanted
without bloating FVWM at all.  Plus it could be used w/ FvwmButtons to
get menus in it's buttons to popup on the button press instead of
release (since FVWM won't display the menu until the release).

What would make it even better is to make it so the module can stay
running instead of being reinvoked every time you want to pop the
menus up.  Then there would be no more delay than popping up a normal
menu.  This will require some more thought though...

As I said in an earlier note, having modules control border/title
attributes presents some problems, but there shouldn't be any problems
with modules that popup menus themselves.

I think so.  But (like I said above) I don't think that it has to
match exactly.  Would the simpler approach I suggested be ok?

I know that this Style command type modification has been suggested
before and I haven't really responded to it except to say "you could
do this with FvwmM4 or Cpp", but this way of presenting it looks very
good and I bet not overly difficult to implement.

Todd, if you come up with this in the near future, let me know.  I'm
adding it to the TO-DO list, so I'll take a crack at it eventually,
but if you do it first, that'd be great.

Only the misspelling of "border".  ;^)

Yes.  use a line like
Style "*" IconBox +foo +bar +blah +yackety

(look in fvwm man page for parameters).

Along these same lines I've got a question (and I'm betting on a no answer).

I like having the styles for each window in a central place for each
window.  But if I use  FvwmIconBox I have to comment out all the global
style "blah"  Icon some.xpm

and add the the same thing below
*FvwmIconBox "blah"  some.xpm

Is there any way to get the FvwmIconBox module to grab the icon setting
from the fvwm style lines?  And is there any way to tell fvwm to not
display icons even when there are Icon style parameters?

I've looked but haven't found.

thanks
jim

would this be 'left - right - top - bottom' independent of each other? Or
maybe just simply 'left -right' as one adjustment and 'top-bottom' as another?

could we add 'Xpm/bitmaps for menus' ? I have a feeling that if one were to
use a '1 column' xpm/bitmap it wouldn't cause that much (maybe I'm wrong)
overhead/code/memory to display...maybe I'm wrong...

corners are a definite 'need' to be able to look like other wm's.  For
instance, the corners of olvwm, or the bottom two 'thingeys' at the corners
vs nothing at the corners at the top of the 'bowman' window manager...
imho, though..

Well, it all depends on where the functionality is placed.  If we add code
to fvwm itself to allow modules to control the styles/decorations of windows,
then we don't need most of this in the fvwm window manager itself, only
in the individual modules that implement it.  However, instead of having
a bunch of differnet modules, maybe what we need is to make a 'FvwmExtraStyle'
module that allows one to, once the module is invoked, specify extra things
for styles.

I would definately use this approach..as to me, it is important to get things
to look 'pixel by pixel' exactly the same.  Maybe I'm picky, but it definately
would be impressive if we could specify 'Desk1 = UseStyle Win95'
'Desk2 = UseStyle Mac', 'Desk3 = UseStyle OS2', 'Desk4 = UseStyle Olvwm'.

I know I"m taking this to the extreme, but it's just one of those 'gee it
would be nice if..' kindof deals.

I quote one of my sysadmin: "If Fvwm were to implement styles to look like 
olvwm, I'll bet it would become the most popular window manager out there'.
Especially considering it's smaller memory footprint.

Here's a question, though.  Are there any copyright problems if we make things
look 'pixel-by-pixel' just like another OS/window manager?

Well, the menu styles is a side issue...but related...so I brought it up.
The idea I was hoping was that it would allow a flexible enough list of
style attributes so that it could be configured to look like different
window managers, not that it would have 10 differnet configurations
hard-coded.

Well, it is all fine and dandy that we can hard-code styles, but I was
hoping that 'style attributes' would be flexible enough, whether more
are added by a module, or they are all in fvwm, to encompass any
configuration we would possibly wish to have, all by specifying
things in the .fvwmrc file.  Maybe it's not possible, but boy would it
be nice.

Hrm, well, what currently determines when a module dies?  When it's window
is closed? FvwmAudio runs w/out opening a window, and it waits for wm events 
... so isn't this what you're looking for?

> I think so.  But (like I said above) I don't think that it has to
> match exactly.  Would the simpler approach I suggested be ok?

Well, maybe initially.  But if it is close, hopefully one could 'tweak' things
so it would be exactly right.  Sorry, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so
I like things exact...and as I said earlier, I would rather make a module
if that is what it takes, than put an 'almost' implementation in fvwm
itself..

> Todd> BTW, for those of you not following the 'wine' development
...
> At least they aren't taking the evil WABI approach of override

Actually, without the '-managed' option, that is exactly what it does.
Plus, with the '-managed' you get the joy of remembering how often windows
apps decide they need the focus....for every time they would, in windows,
pop to the 'top' and grab the focus, they also do this in X.  It is really
annoying, especially if you use '-privatemap' for its own colormap..so
for ill-behaved apps there is the '-desktop widthxheight' option that has
wine pop up a window in wich the app/apps will run, and that 'wine' window
behaves as a good X app should...

Actually, I feel that is an even worse option than bloating fvwm with
1000's of different runtime options.  Because then the docs would have
to cover all the different compile options and someone would install
it at some site with one set of options, and after seeing the docs
some user would complain that they wanted these other options compiled
in but definitely don't compile in this one option here, and another
user would have a different set of requirements, and so on.

This may not be an FVWM-specific question, but then again, maybe it is!
:)

I just had to restart my X server because almost all the colors in the
default color map were reserved.  I don't know what app was reserving
them.  I exited all the ones I can think of: Netscape (which I run with
its own colormap anyway), Frame, Emacs, etc.  All I had running were
FVWM and a bunch of xterms.

I wonder if FVWM wasn't holding all those colors?  I don't have wildly
colorful pixmaps I don't think.  Is there a colormap leak?  I'm using
2.0p33 on SunOS 4.1.3_U1 running X11R5 p26 (no openwin!).

Any ideas?  Are some apps known to leak colors?  Is there any way I can
find out which apps have what colors reserved in the default color map?
xdpyinfo, xwininfo didn't seem to say much.

I think I can help with the second part.  I use this to turn on ICONBOX
on the fly, (without removing the "sytle icon" specifications:

AddToFunc ConfigIconBox "I" module FvwmIconBox
+                       "I" Style     "*"  NoIcon
+                       "I" Recapture

AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "Modules" Title
+ "IconBox"  ConfigIconBox
...

(It is the order of execution of the style commands that is important.)

I have heard of this before on this list.  Think back to when you started
the X server.  Some openlook programs have been known to not de-allocate
colors they allocated when starting up.  In any case, every time I've
heard this problem before, it ended up being another app, not fvwm.
That doesn't mean it isn't fvwm, but try to repeat the problem...and
see if it is another app, or fvwm..

Is it possible, however, for fvwm to check the 'allocated colormap' and
find out which ones aren't being used for any app and then de-allocate them?

This sounds like a great idea for a module if it is possible.

It would work, but that takes all the run-time-configurability ideas out
of the picture and reduces them to compile-time ideas.

I don't like that at all.  I'd rather help create flexible code that is
so flexible that the styles can look like other window managers and not
be bloated at the same time.  The key here is that you specify things in
the .fvwmrc, not in the sourcecode.

Heyyo,

I sent a piece of e-mail awhile back about apps that de-iconify underneath
other xterms or apps.  I thought the problem might have been isolated to
the NetBSD/sparc (v1.1) setup, but it isn't.

I'm seeing the same problems under NetBSD/i386. (v1.1)

This is -very- annoying.  I'm currently working around the problem by
simply not iconify'ng anything.

I have a fairly vanilla setup, I can provide my .fvwmrc files upon request.

This is the same symptom that was fixed somewhere between 1.22q and 1.24r,
I can grab the 1.24r tarball and point to the reference in the ChangeLog.

I can help with some debugging if need be, I really need to see this fixed.

Otherwise, it's a perfect window manager (for me).  Keep up the good work.

Hi,

Well, What I noticed was that xpaint was compiled with xpm-lib V4.6,
and many people are using V4.7. The Problem is that some functions in
the V4.6 are different from Version 4.7. I too had the problem of
Xpaint crashing when using V4.7, downgraded and I can use it again :)
without it to crash. Recompiling it with Xpm's 4.7 is useless. Looks
like there are definitions using the V4.6 Version, and these seg-fault
when used with V4.7 :) So folks, downgrade, or link the V4.6
statically in xpaint :)

I've gotten some mail about problems setting up tkgoodstuff as an fvwm
module.  Most problems come from one of two sources:

1. Not installing tkfvwm.  You need to do this. You must either use
"fvwmwish" (an extended wish interepreter) or use wish4.1 and have a
loadable library tkfvwm4.1.so in the tk4.1 library directory.  Read
the tkgoodstuff docs for pointers.

2. Using the "win95" sample rc file included in the distribution.  Way
out of date and completely useless.  Very sorry.  I enclose a replacement.

# .TkGoodStuffrc for a win95 look.

I'm not sure what the 2nd option in this list means, but please
note that the mwm-style has some items (titlebar) with a 1 pixel highlight/
shadow on the top and sides, and a 2 pixel shadow on the bottom.

Also, note that any dynamic configuration (while generally good) will slow
down the redraw operatation just a little.

Now, I've been thinking about the "module to do decorations". You
could have fvwm re-parent the application window (use the 2-level
reparenting that it uses now, but leave out the title-bar, buttons,
side-bars, and corners.  This would leave a decor-less frame in which
a module would work. The module would tell fvwm how big to make the
frame, and where to put the window inside the frame, and the module
could create its own windows within the frame for decoration. This would not
be unnecessarily slow, since the module would do its own redraws, and get
expose events for its own windows. Note that the module would also have
to handle receipt of and processing for all the actions that are bound
to window decorations.

This is a very complicated undertaking, of course.

If you "restart" the window manager, and the colormap problems go away, then
it is a color map leak in the window manager. If you have to exit X11 and
start over, its probably a server problem. When an application dies, its colors
are supposed to be freed up. I have noticed, however, that there is some 
application which seems able to chew up the color map permanently, although 
I don't know what it is.

Fvwm never returns colors to the x server. Once it takes a color, it keeps it.
This is because the dynamic color allocation is for icons and borders, which
are likely to show up over and over, if they have shown up once.

I guess you're saying that when fvwm de-iconifies windows, it doesn't raise
them. This is deliberate, because you control it in your .fvwmrc file.

Instead of Iconify, use Iconify-Func:

AddToFunc Iconify-Func  "I" Iconify
+ 			  "I" Raise

Then it is not a problem.

Woo-woo!  Cool!  (it works)

(Say, is this in the FAQ, and if not, could someone put it in, for others?)

Rob> I'm not sure what the 2nd option in this list means,

I meant being able to set the sidebara to one width and the corner
(which is what I meant to type, not 'control') handles to another,
like how olwm has thick corners and thin sides with no shadow.

Actually, I hadn't noticed that before...  I don't really use the MWM
lookalike features that often.

But I didn't mean for for the first line above to control the borders
of the titlebar & buttons, just for the sidebars & corners.  The
button look could be controlled via the pixmaps for buttons, and the
titlebar via the titlebar style options (which would have to account
for the MWM style).

Right, which is why I'd like any proposed changes to be as simple as
possible, so as not to impact performance.

Honestly, I don't care if fvwm can look like any other window managers
or not.  I like fvwm's look the way it is, but it was the other
features (and the fact that it was so small) that made me want to use
it initially.  And I plan to keep it that way - as small as possible
and as powerful as possible too, only adding things to enhance it's
"value" without bloating it.

Yes, it certainly doesn't seem trivial...

I was thinking about just adding the window id's for the titlebar &
buttons to the module communication protocol, to allow the modules to
play with those windows.  I was hoping that would be almost enough,
but perhaps not.

Just a historical side-note...
The original versions of fvwm had the top corners merged with the buttons, and
the title-bar merged with the top side-bar, so that the top of the window
looked more or less like the bottom, but fatter. I liked it, but several
people sent patches to make it look like the current scheme, so I figured,
its time to switch...

Anyway, it would probably be genuinely useful to modify fvwm to gracefully
acept malloc and window creation failures than to make it have more border
styles. Right now, when you run out of swap space, its likely that fvwm will
die, instead of just some user-application. This seems kind of bad, even if
it doesn't generally happen much. (Does anyone know if the X server handles
malloc failures well? If not, there's not much point in fixing fvwm...)

That would have been about 0.1, I guess.

Sounds interesting.  Just out of curiosity, what version # did that

Agreed, and actually I think there are a lot of other things that fall

I'm going to try and do some of them over my vacation next week.

I'll see that it gets put into the included .fvwmrc file, at least.
Perhaps the FAQ as well.

One simple way to  allocate colors permanently  is to use xstdcmap  (X
standard colormap utility).  This allocates a lot of colors and unless
called later with the -delete argument, the colors  stay allocated.  I
have run into at least one application that did this.

The best  way I know  to monitor the colormap,  is with the "colormap"
program which I think you can easily find using archie.

Thanks for the patch.  I'll take a look at it, but at first glance I
doubt I'll include it verbatim.  I have another patch that was sent to
me a while ago that changes the IconBox behavior that I have to look
over better as well.  The two patches cover different, but related
things (Icon placment).

Instead of adding another sizeable field to the FvwmWindow structure
for the IconGrid (as you have done), what might be better would be for
me to merge some of the functionality of the two patches together,
minimizing memory usage and maximizing functionality.  Like the
ability to make an IconBox area operate with a grid behavior.

Thanks,
Chuck

Anyone know where I can get the source for rclock? It used to be

Atleast with 3.1.1, I have experienced *many* lockups due to memory
exhaustion in X.  (Didn't have swap on the time).  I'd tentively
would say "it don't handle them well."  Also, I've read in a couple
of places that XFree86 servers are known for locking up the
actual machine when the machine runs out of memory.

On the subject of dynamic configuration, how hard would it be to have
the window border colors dynamically update by communicating with a
module? The only window manager I've seen do this is olwm.

Yes, but it is still usefull to align icons placed outside an IconBox.
So, I think it makes sense to use a grid for the whole screen rather
than only inside an IconBox.

Hi,

I am still trying to learn how to do things on Fvwm2.  It is a great =
desktop!  My boss wants to be able to use the "Front" key on his Sparc =
Station 2 as it did work under olvwm (ie. if the window is in front, =
make it go to the back.  If the window is in back, make it come to the =
front).  Is there a way to toggle Raise/Lower commands?

In v1 of fvwm when I had a window that was only obscuring the title bar
of another window, and I moved the mouse into the second window (which only 
had the title bar obscured)  it wouldn't raise the title bar.  Now in v2
it does.  I guess change to module interface.

Is there any way to get the old behavior back?  
(other than changing source :)  
Or was this an inadvertent (sp??) 'feature'?  :)

thanks

The "RaiseLower" command will do what you want.
I bind this command to Alt-F5.  This is not as convenient as just plain F5,
but it leaves the function key free.  To bind to plain F5, replace the 'M'
with an 'N'.

add to .fvwm2rc:
	Key F5		A	M	RaiseLower

While F5 is appropriate for my PC keyboard, it is probably *not* correct
for a Sparc keyboard.  Who knows the correct keycode?

Thanks,

On the Sparc Station, this line works:

F15 FTIWS A RaiseLower

Thank you for your help!

Here's what I've got in my .fvwm2rc:

Key L5          A       A       RaiseLower
Key L7          A       A       Iconify

This also binds the "Open" key to toggle iconified/open windows.

I disagree, having an icon grid makes much sense inside the icon box
since you want a rigid arrangement of icons inside the box.  But outside
of the icon box I want to place the icons wherever I choose.  One thing
I hate about some UIs is that they snap the icon to some pre-defined
grid instead of where you originally place it, this goes against the 
Unix/X philosophy of flexibility and user-control.

I recently upgraded from Solaris 2.4 to Solaris 2.5 and just noticed the
Direct X library in /opt/SUNWdxlib.  Basically, if you set
/opt/SUNdxlib/lib/dxlib/SunOS5.x in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable ahead of
the others, then X programs will link with a special version of Xlib that
allows them to access the local screen as much as 50-175% faster by using
Sun's DGA extension. 

Needless to say that sounded pretty interesting so I added the appropriate
line to my .xinitrc, and it turns out that FVWM does not like these
libraries!  FVWM 1.24r crashed after just a few seconds (and seemed to
take much longer to start up), and FVWM 2.0.39 seemed to work okay, then
crashed when I selected Exit.  In both cases, the entire screen froze and
I had to kill the X server from a remote login... 

According to the Direct Xlib answerbook, normal X11 applications should 
not have any problems with these libraries, unless they reach below the 
X11 API or attempt to extend it.  I doubt that FVWM does either of these 
things.  Has anyone tried anything similar with FVWM (I know an older 
version of Direct Xlib was in Solaris 2.4, and perhaps earlier)?

Has anyone successfully built Fvwm 2.0.39 on NetBSD? Or FreeBSD?
The problem I'm having arises during compilation of the Fvwm core. The
individual .c files compile ok, but when at the linking stage ld complains
about an 'undefined symbol being referenced from text segment'.

I apologise for not having the exact error message, but I do know I've had
the same problem on both FreeBSD 2.1 and NetBSD 1.1

Can anyone shed some light on the problem?
TIA,
Dave Murphy <c1dmurph@compapp.dcu.ie>

Well, this seems to be a matter of taste. I really don't want to
start another flame war, but when I specify an alignment for my icon
box at the left side of the screen, and I move some icons to the right
side of the screen, I also want them to be aligned. When you ask me,
not being able to specify an alignment outside an icon box goes
against the Unix/X philosophy of flexibility and user-control :-).

Perhaps we could come up with a really flexible solution that supports
both preferences. For example, you could treat an IconGrid differently
when it is specified together with an IconBox in the same Style
definition:

   Style "*"   IconBox 0 0 800 100, IconGrid 70 92 10 6
vs.
   Style "*"   IconBox 0 0 800 100
   Style "*"   IconGrid 70 92 10 6

In AddToList(), you can detect that IconBox and IconGrid are used in
the same Style definition and set a flag in the name_list_struct in
this case. However, the difference might be a little to subtle to
document, and we are better off with an additional keyword to set a
flag?

It would really help having the symbol that it's complaining about,
but I bet I know anyways.  It's complaining about 'basename' which is
called from fvwm.c.  I never should have put it in there, and it's
gone in the forthcoming patchlevel, so just remove the reference.

Having taken a look at the fvwm2 code(pl 34) I noticed a small bit in a
function called SetTitleBar (borders.c)

In this you define where the title bar text goes.
If the horizontal offset is changed in a few different way you can have
left,right and center justification.

I did it by setting it to one of the 3 values below:

hor_off = (t->title_width - w)/2;          centre
hor_off = (t->title_width - w)-10;	   right
hor_off =10;				   left

if this could be incorporated into the fvwm config file I'm sure that it
would take very little code to do. I'm still a novice at X programming,
but I'm happy to help if I can because that way I can learn.

I don't compile under Solaris (normally), and don't have access to
version 2.5 regardless, and haven't seen anyone else mention this
before either, but you could try modifying the makefile and linking
against those libs directly and seeing how well it links and runs
then.

Theoretically it shouldn't make a difference, but I'd try it anyways.

Also, try another window manager (like twm, olwm, or mwm) and see how
it reacts.

Hope this helps,
Chuck

Actually, the whole concept of the IconBox being moved into the Style
command is so that you hopefully don't have to manually move your
icons.  If you like all of your xterm icons in one area, and all of
your Emacs icons in another:

  Style "XTerm" IconBox <region 1>
  Style "Emacs" IconBox <region 2>

But this is beside the point.

Actually, this suggestion really doesn't make sense.  Since the Style
commands set up this way are cummulative for all other things, this
would be confusing.

I don't think that the concept of an IconGrid needs to be on a per
window basis (and I really don't want to add another sizeable field to
the FvwmWindow structure), but it might be useful as a global option
that controls free icon placement.  Something that would cause moving
any icon to snap to this grid.  It could have additional options like
num of grid columns and rows, alignment options (AlignBottom,
AlignMiddle, AlignTop), justification (Centered, RightJustified,
LeftJustified), etc.  Like so:

  IconGrid 40x30, AlignBottom, Centered
  Style "*" IconBox 0 0 20 800

This example would by default place icons down the left side of the
screen, but if you decided to move them manually they would snap to a
40x30 grid (compassing the whole screen) and Align at the bottoms of
each grid square, centered in it horizontally.  And the default would
be "None" for no IconGrid.  And a similiar optional gridding scheme
could be added as an option to the IconBox as well.

I also have another IconPlacement patch from Austin Donnelly to look
at more closely.  And another thing that might be interesting would be
the ability to stuff an icon that you moved by hand back into an
IconBox area.

This is all on the TO-DO list now.  If I can find (or someone
suggests) a good way to consolidate all of this into one easy to
understand way with consistent syntax, I'll let you all know the
resulting idea to see if it meets everyones greatest wishes and
desires for icon handling in fvwm...

Regardless, none of these ideas would get incorporated until after the
first official release, whenever that might actually happen.  I hope
to do a lot more cleanup over my vacation (which starts this evening)
and perhaps make it a New Years gift to the internet.  And maybe I'll
get 2.0.40 out today before I go on vacation (but I'm making no
promises there, of course).

That wouldn't be from a change in the module interface, but in the
Raise code in fvwm to operate correctly.

Nope.

I believe that it was inadvertent.  If a window gets raised, all of
it's decorations should be raised as well.

Correct.  Unfortunately it doesn't work for me.

That's a good idea.  I tried it right away, but so far haven't found
the right coordinates for the iconbox, so that it really shows up where
I want it to be.  Very tricky.

The way I understand it, it should be very easy, since fvwm1 did do this
already.  On the other hand there may be many internal changes that I am
not aware of that make it impossible to port the v1 code to fvwm2.
Is that the case?

FVWM is the only window manager that really deserves being used.

Actually, this has been submitted by someone else as a patch against
1.xx, which I've had forever and have been meaning to incorporate into
2.xx, and it worked differently.  I'll see about starting to add it as
part of the TitleStyle option that I wanted (but for now it'll only
handle justification) for the next patchlevel, since it's only a very
little bit of code.

>Is that the case?

Here's how it goes:
>> Andy>  +                                "D" Delete

Fvwm checks to see if the window understands the "Delete" protocol. Not all
windows do. If it understands "Delete", fvwm sends the delete message
to the window. If the program operating the window is working well, it
will remove itself sometime in the relatively near future. (May not be
immediate, the application may pop-up a confirm box, may save its state,
whatever). As far as fvwm is concerned, the "Delete" action is done when
the message is sent, even if the window still exists.

> Andy>  +                                "D" Close
Similar to delete, but if the window doesn't understand "Delete", the window
is destroyed. At this point, you have either sent two delete messages, or
have beeped and destroyed the window. When destroying a window, Fvwm 
actually removes the window, and the program usually, but not always,
crashes.

> Andy>  +                                "D" Destroy
This will make fvwm actually destroy the window. Chances are, this will
happen before any of the "Delete" messages are handled by the application.

While it would be nice for fvwm to send a delete message, and then wait
to see if the window goes away, and then destroy the window if its not
responding, this is difficult to code up. What if the program pops up
a confirm dialog before going away? The delay could be indefinite.

The correct thing to put in your menu, is a simple "Close" this will
correctly remove all windows, except those that understand "Delete" and
are misbehaving (crashing, poorly written, whatever). To handle the case
of a misbehaving window, have a separate item "Destroy" which you invoke only
if the window doesn't respond to "Close"

(and similar settings don't work for FvwmWinList)?

Greetings!

I have recently converted to fvwm-2.0.39 from ctwm-3.3.  Overall I'm
very pleased.  However, I have some suggested improvements.  As you
might expect, these are features in ctwm :)


Comments/suggestions welcome.


Fvwm
+  Provide a "moveDelta" for motion triggers.  A motion trigger will only
   occur if you move the mouse more than a specified X pixels within a
   specified time.  Thus, you would not be required to have the hands of
   a surgeon if you have an Immediate or Move function.
      
+  Provide a "focusOnly" function, i.e., redirects keyboard focus to a
   specified window, but does not raise the window or warp the cursor to
   it.  This very useful with Icon Managers where you can slide the mouse
   just a little to move between a bunch of windows.

   Invariably when I'm hot and heavy into debugging I have a bunch of
   windows I'm switching between alot and don't need to see the whole thing.

+  Allow some form of "warp" to indicated position.  When I do want to warp
   to a window I'd prefer to be able to have the cursor go somewhere other
   than the upper left corner.  Maybe a percentage form would be nice,
   warp x% y%, so
      warp 50 50
   would place the cursor in the middle of the specified window.

+  Why was the cursor stuff removed?  I don't care for some of the cursors.

+  I'm not sure where this one goes, either in Fvwm or in FvwmPager. 
   Basically I find "stick" rather restrictive, its an "all or one" thing.
   What I would like is to have windows exist in a general subset of
   pages/desks.  Then provide an "occupy" function ala ctwm.   When you
   select a window to apply this function to, a set of buttons pop up, one
   for each desk and page.  You select which places the window occurs on
   by depressing/undepressing buttons and then click on an "OK".


FvwmPager
+  Allow pager to toggle between the current map and a set of buttons (ala
   ctwm).  When the pager is just buttons there would be buttons for each
   desk and each page in each desk.  Clicking a button takes you to that
   desk/page.  Support toggling by both some form of function/message to
   the module and a key press (e.g. control) in the pager window.

+  Allow separate sizes for map and buttons configurations.  The buttons
   don't need to take up as much room as the map.


FvwmIconMan
+  Make each entry appear as a button (ala ctwm)
+  Make button corresponding to window with focus depressed/raised (opposite
   of other icon buttons)
+  Allow an action to be bound to the entering of these buttons.  E.g.,
   just placing the mouse on an icon button directs focus to the corresponding
   window (see the focus only function above).
+  Allow ignoring of transient windows.
+  Add regular expressions as mentioned in man page
+  Maybe add the next/prev stuff from ctwm

FvwmAuto
+  Allow only certain windows to autoRaise.  The recent ctwms to this.
   In general, I don't like auto raising.  However, I prefer allowing
   things like clock and FvwmPager/ctwm's workspaces to autoRaise as
   opposed to having them always on top.

+  Maybe allow different raise delays for windows, using wildcards

Hi Rob,

thanks a lot for your long answer.  I see that I misunderstood
fvwm's behavior.

You're right.  I can see the problem.

Chuck, you can take this off of the TO-DO list again.  But maybe it would
make sense to put Rob's answer into the FAQ.

I now changed Delete to Close and got the behavior I was wishing to
have.  I added a special menu item and keyboard shortcut for the
destroy option, in case Close doesn't work.

Thanks again,
 Andy.

This has become an FAQ.

There is a reference to `basename()' in fvwm/fvwm.c (I think) that does
not exist on many systems. It's used in the usage message and can be
removed.

I have built most versions of FVWM, including 2.0.39, with no
problems, both on my home NetBSD machine, and my work IRIX 5.2/5.3
machine.  Your problem appears to be some missing library.  At least
tell us the name of the undefined symbol.  Then we can tell you which
library is missing.

Quoting Richard Guay,
| 
| Hi,
| 
| I am still trying to learn how to do things on Fvwm2.  It is a great =
| desktop!  My boss wants to be able to use the "Front" key on his Sparc =
| Station 2 as it did work under olvwm (ie. if the window is in front, =
| make it go to the back.  If the window is in back, make it come to the =
| front).  Is there a way to toggle Raise/Lower commands?

The following is my setting for some of the Sun keyboard keys.

/* Function keys on Sun Keyboard on Top Row*/
Key F1          A       N       Exec me(netscape) &
Key F2          A       N       Exec me(netscape -install) &
Key F5          A       N       Exec makex(Adder)
Key F6          A       N       Exec makex(Lambda) 
Key F7          A       N       Exec makex(Castor)
Key F8          A       N       Exec xterm -sb -si -sl 700 -font 7x14 -T Local &

/*  Keys on the function keypad on the Left of the Sun Keyboard:
    F11 = Stop, F12 = Again, ..., F20 = Cut
*/
Key F11         AWF       N       Next [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
Key F12         AWF       N       Prev [!iconic CurrentScreen CurrentDesk] Focus
Key F13          WF       N       Maximize     100 100
Key F15          WF       N       RaiseLower ""
Key F17          WIF      N       Iconify ""
Key F18          WF       N       Stick ""
Key F20         WIF      N       Delete ""
Key Help         AWF       N       Iconify ""

--

So F11 = the Stop key.  I have mapped this and F12 (Again) to left
and right cycle through open windows on current screen.

F13 = Props: I have mapped to Maximise
F15 = Front: I mapped to RaiseLower, which is what you want I think.
F17 = Open : I map to iconify...
F18 = Paste: The perfect name for the key to make something sticky
F20 = Cut  : The perfect name for the key to close a window :-)

Cheerio,
Jon

Hm.  I wouldn't have expected a crash, but in general Modules don't
handle popups very well (happens on button release instead of button
press).

I have activated the module autoraise with a delay of 2 seconds or so.
When I enter any motif program and after 1.9 seconds press the Filemenu 
choice, the filemenu is nicely popped. But then, since now it has passed 
0.1 second and since i am not in the newly popped up filemenu window. 
Autoraise decides to raise the main window above this popped window!
Oups where did the filemenu go! Is there some way to detect if a 
menuwindow is a child of a window and should not be put behind it?
Is there any way to prevent this? I am using version 2.0.38.

I believe the function he's having problems with is "basename".  On my 
Solaris box at work, I had to link with -lgen in order for this function 
to be found.  Chuck already replied to this message that this dependence 
will be removed in the next patch, because too many people had trouble 
with it.

Howdy all,

Well, I haven't had a lot of time lately to do much with FVWM (work
and other responsibilites have kept me VERY busy lately), but in a
burst of post-lunch activity version 2.0.40 is finially ready and
available at ftp.hpc.uh.edu in /pub/fvwm/version-2 (and in keeping
with my 1 release per month average lately).

-rw-rw-r--   1 chines   users     477303 Dec 20 14:28 fvwm-2.0.40.tar.gz

>From the ChangeLog:

2.0.40
       1. Removed 'basename' reference
       2. More small Imake fixes
       3. Renamed FvwmConfig .cc files to .C, because some C++ compilers
          can't handle the .cc extension (AIX's, for instance)
       4. FvwmForm now gets config info in standard way
       5. FvwmBanner now dissappears if you click on it (like in 1.xx)
       6. Renamed FvwmConfig's makefile to Makefile.std and cleaned it up
       7. More small man page cleanups
       8. Improved handling of nonexistant fonts (added GetFontOrFixed)
       9. More debug messges, and central fvwm_msg function for printing
          msgs (started converting fvwm_err and fprintf calls to use this
          instead, as it has variable args and allows for a consistent
          message feel and I'll use this to add -outfile <file> option
          eventually to capture all fvwm output to a file as well as
          stderr)
       10. Fixed function parm $9 coredump
       11. Added basic TitleStyle (for justfication & edge appearance)

Some notes on these:

        #1 Hopefully I won't mistakenly put anything like that in again.

        #2 Please let this be the last of the Imake problems...

        #4 It should now work ok for those of you who use FvwmM4 and Cpp.

        #5 I kinda missed that feature.

        #9 I used stdarg.h vararg stuff.  Hopefully it'll compile ok for
           everyone (I don't see why it wouldn't).  I still have to
           finish converting to using it and work on the module
           interaction with it.

        #11 I added info about this in the man page.  Try a few combinations:

              TitleStyle Centered Raised
              TitleStyle LeftJustified Flat
              TitleStyle RightJustified Sunk

            It probably isn't complete, but it wasn't much code to implement
            so I threw it in there (finally).  Admittedly, I still
            much prefer the default...

There were a few patches that people sent me that I didn't have time
to throw in.  Sorry if yours didn't make it this time.

I'm going on vacation this afternoon until about Jan 2nd.  So I
probably won't be too responsive to notes during that time, although I
will try to dial in occasionally to check them.

During that time I hope to do a fair amount of work at home on fvwm.
I plan on putting in a few more of the patches sent to me, and
cleaning up the docs a bit.

I'd like to release the next version as the first official 2.xx
release (2.1.0) shortly after I come back as my way of saying Happy
New Year to the Internet.

Then I can finially do some bigger cleanup, bugfixes, and enhancements
without feeling too bad... ;^)

Happy Holidays,
Chuck

No way to prevent this except to wait until the window is raised
before popping up the menu.  The reason is that override redirect
windows are used for the popups, and are ignored by the window
manager.  I don't believe that this can really be helped.

Hello,

I tried the key mappings that were given for the Sun keyboard "Props"
and "Front" and "Open" keys.  Unfortunately, they have no effect.  I
think the problem is that I am not using the proper key identifier. 
Does anyone know how find out what FVWM2 calls certain keys.  In other
words, is their someway to tell FVWM2 to echo the identifier of a key,
so that we know what it is called.  Under emacs, there is facility for
doing this, if you type C-h c and then the desired key.  How about FVWM2?

I have been able to assign functions such as page scrolling  and desk
moving to the keys "Next" "Prior" "Left" "Right".  These work fine.


Thanks,

Chad

   Has anyone else had trouble linking fvwm 2.0.40?  I get 'undefined
ref to XLoadQueryFont' errors.  I'm running Linux and XFree86 3.1.1,
except that I need the XS3 server from XFree86 3.1.2 for my video
card.  The rest of the Linux set-up is so mangled it bears no
resemblence to whatever distribution I started with, which is good
because I can't remember which distribution I started with.  :-)
It's definitely a.out, though.  2.0.39 had no trouble.

   -lX11 was coming before ../libs/libfvwm.a in the linking command.  A
simple enough change if you can wade through an Imake generated Makefile.
(I just keyed the linking command myself.)  It's running now.  I haven't
been getting enough sleep lately; that was easy enough to figure out
after a nap.  Back to lurking ....

I am using the Style command in fvwm 2.0.39 to specify different icons for
different applications.  Some of my applications first start out in XTerm
windows (i.e. matlab), but when I start the app, I have it change the
title of the window (to, sfor instance, matlab).  But, the window manager
still thinks this is an XTerm window and shows me the XTerm icon when
iconified.  If I start the application via 'xterm -T matlab -e matlab',
all is well with the window styles and icons used.  Or, if fvwm is
Restarted, all the styles and icons used are updated to those
corresponding to the new window name. 

Since I don't want to open a new xterm when I start an application, is
there any way to force the properties of a given window to be refreshed so
the icon and styles for the new title will be used.

This is a great window manager!!  Keep up the good work.

Thanks,

Mike

I was just updating my fvwm from 1.xx to 2.0 and I found a nice list of 
old .fvwmrc commands and their 2.0 replacements. I converted the old one 
pretty succesfully, with one exception: The NoPPlacement should be 
Style "<something>" NoPPosition, but I don't think this is supported.

Is there a command to accomplish this? It's pretty irritating when the 
windows appear at 0,0 behind my pager...

Please send any replies via e-mail. Thanks in advance.

Odd that they don't work.  Work for me and all the various suns here

What you should do is use the unix command 'xev' to find the names
that your X server assigns the keys.

I too fell over this one (under HPUX 9), you get a linker error making fvwm2:

        /bin/ld: Unsatisfied symbols:
           XLoadQueryFont (code)

The libfvwm2.a library should be the first in the list, here is the patch to
makefile.h:

Are you running X11R6? The key names change when you do so. Try
SunProps, SunFront and SunOpen as well as the L* keys.

To determine what keys you have, you can use "xev" (if installed).
It produces a lot of output, regrettably.

A very good program for looking at your keymap - and customizing it -
is xkeycaps, available from ftp.x.org.

I used to have a simple program for displaying the key name; don't
think I brought it with me when I changed jobs, though.

Is there a way to bring it up in the fvwm environment?  Thanks.

Suppose folloing situation:

	* Prepare blank desktop (let me set desktop number 1)
	* Prepare another desktop, and place some window.
	  (let me set desktop number 2)
	  when placing windows, fill upper-left corner of display.
	* Suppose
		Style "foobar" StartsOnDesk 1, SkipMapping
	  is set.
	* change desktop to 1
	* invoke foobar and see what's happen. ---(a)
	* close "foobar" application
	* change desktop to 2
	* invoke foobar and see what's happen. ---(b)

Result of (a) and (b) is NOT the same. In case (a), foobar is placed
upper-left of the display, but in case (b), place of foobar depends on
desktop number 2's current placements of window.

This behavior is not that same as what we expected. I think fvwm
should treat "which desktop to place".

I take a grance into source code of fvwm, and found that this is a
SmartPlacement() (in fvwm/placement.c) problem. In fact,
SmartPlacement() treats only CURRENT desktop when calculating position
of window. But sorry now I don't have enough time to make a patch to
fix. Anyone ?

iosteam.h or iostream.h?  iostream.h, along with other C++ goodies, is 
found in a separate GNU package (libg++), available at your favorite GNU
ftp site.

You're attempting to run the old SunView perfmeter. Check your PATH
to ensure that /usr/openwin/bin is in there and is before wherever
the SunView perfmeter is to be found.

If it is, in fact, the SunView perfmeter you're trying to run (not
the OpenWindows one) forget it.

I'm running FVWM 2.0.39 with SGI IRIX 5.3.  Things are mostly fine.
When I run an FDDI monitoring program called "fddivis", the windows
get displayed without borders.  Fddivis is bundled with IRIX.  I have
a line like the following in my .fvwmrc file:

Style "fddivis*" HandleWidth 4

This line controls fddivis windows, as I verified by trying "NoTitle".
But no matter what other options I try on the above line, fddivis
windows never get borders.

Fddivis is not a normal X application.  It won't run on anything but
an SGI.  I think it uses features of the SGI X server.  I assume it's
"special" in the way it interacts with a window manager, too.  When
run with SGI's 4Dwm window manager (the "IRIS Extended Motif Window
manager"), fddivis gets borders.

Is there anything I can try to fix the problem?

Can you use the Xaw3d widget in building fvwm2?  Does it add much to the 
appearance?  Thanks.

Sounds like you might have installed GCC 2.7.0 from the Slackware 3.0 Linux 
distribution.  The g++ directory was improperly placed, all you have to do is 
make sure that there are two symlinks, "/usr/include/g++" and 
"/usr/include/g++-include", and that they both are linked to 
/usr/lib/g++-include".  After doing this I was able to compile FvwmConfig.

Luck++;

As far as I'm aware, fvwm2 doesn't even use the Athena widget libraries.

Hi,

I need as fast as possible funtions to disable some function, key or
module definations, like killing Menus with DestroyMenu. Another way
to do this were to add functions DefineFunction and DefineModule, which 
would override current functions/module definations: DefineMenu were
nice too, it were cleaner to say 

DefineMenu Programs ...
than 
DestroyMenu Programs
AddtoMenu Programs ... 

You know what happens if you forget DestroyMenu ;) I think it's silly
to restart window manager to change a menu, add a button to button bar
or start playing doom & disable cursor movement with ctrl, alt + arrows.
Last one could be done just by adding possiblity to undefine keys by
saying something like 

Key Left A CM Nop

which would disable Left with alt+ctrl. Now fvwm eats event, but does 
nothing. AND this shouldn't of course disable left+alt or left+ctrl.

Yes I can live without these, but I think these functions are necessary:
think about reading twice FvwmButtons section from some rc file, oops we 
have all buttons twice!! Same with functions. My idea is, that we should
be able to read any config file multiple times without messing things up.
This way we could use my function RestartModules, which reads config 
files for different modules, kills all running modules and restarts 
them.

What do you think about my way of using Read and resource files? I think
it's better this way: lib/fvwm2 has a subdirectory resources. There is 
a config file for every module, styles, icons, functions mouse/key
binding etc. my system .fvwm2rc reads these and does nothing else: 
so a user can copy system rc file, make his own key bindings file 
and use everything else from system just by changing where to read
key bindings from. Haven't noticed any speed penalty from reading 
multiple files. I'll send my resources dir tar'red if you want, 
it could be nice to have this structure default. Maybe .fvwm2rc should
itself be moved there with name FvwmRc and tell fvwm to read it from
there when compiled... I think this change could help us write tools to 
change resources interactively like FvwmConfig does. 

FvwmButtons: Has someone thought about adding a button which would
'close' button bar, or move it vertically/horizontally a'la NeXT? Closed
button bar would have only this one button with a 'Open' logo on it.
I find this pretty useful. Also submenus were cool, or group button 
windows... And pushing a swallowed program should be possible to use 
starting another program ( pushing xbiff starts mailer ... )

Still more: is someone working with standard for icon name/application
interface? It were not big thing make fvwm to try first find icons with 
applications' name/resource with first letter capital (for netscape 
Netscape.xpm), then fall to default, and if explicitly defined, use 
some other icon instead of the name matching one. I think this would
clean things. 

Yes, I'm going to try write these small changes myself. Told you just 
hoping that someone has already done this and I don't have to... tell me
if someone's working on these things. I have thousands of other little
patches to make fvwm better, but lets save some for next time too... 

Merry Chrismas ;-)

I accidentally deleted the HP-UX patch for 2.0.40.  Could someone mail
that to me?  If not, is there a site where these messages are archived?

Thanks,

I read a post a while back about someone wished that FvwmPager would
allow you to set different color backgrounds.  This is a small patch
that I made that uses the syntax:

*FvwmPagerDeskColor <desk> <color>

to set the desk color for each desktop.  Note:  The Icon mode still uses
the color specified in *FvwmPagerBack.  If a color is not specifed for a
particuliar desk, it defaults to the value of FvwmPagerBack or to white
if the later is also not specified.  Here is a tidbit from my .fvwm2rc:

*FvwmPagerFore		#a4978e
*FvwmPagerLabel		0	main()
*FvwmPagerLabel		1	Netscape
*FvwmPagerLabel		2	Ileaf
*FvwmPagerLabel		3	other
*FvwmPagerDeskColor	0	#25383c
*FvwmPagerDeskColor	1	#413839
*FvwmPagerDeskColor	2	#610521
*FvwmPagerDeskColor	3	#052567
*FvwmPagerColumns	1
*FvwmPagerFont		-*-new century schoolbook-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Yes, all messages (since I took over the lists) are archived.  This is from
the informational message that all new users get when they sign on; users
that were here for the switch might not have seen it:

That's where a grid of 0 spacing comes in handy! (assuming this is a
user-configurable value).

Sorry, this can't happen.  Any 'clicks' are passed through to the underlying
application, currently.

I wonder, could FvwmButtons have an option to define mouse events just as fvwm
itself does?  Or is fvwm the only thing that can capture mouse events over an
application window?

BTW, checkout tkgoodstuff.  It has an app like 'xbiff' and it does execute
something when you click on it, which is user-configurable, of course..

Hello all,

I have created an FVWM Web Page offering screen shots of my FVWM 2.x and 1.x 
desktops, and the configuration files which produced them.

I'd appreciate any suggestions or feedback, and would be grateful if you'd add 
a link from your FVWM Page to mine.

Thanks for your consideration on this matter.

The address is:

Hi!

I'm having a problem setting up Fvwm V2 to work as follows:

In V1.24 I could set 'AutoRaise' to a negative value like -100,
and when I click in a partially occluded window it would take focus
but would NOT raise the window or change its stacking order. 

my default Style:

Style "*"           BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5
Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm, Color Black/#40a0c0
Style "*"           SmartPlacement,RandomPlacement
Style "*"           MWMFunctions,MWMDecor,HintOverride
Style "*"           DecorateTransient,IconBox 0 -10 -280 -1
Style "*"           ClickToFocus

taken from the V1.24 man page:
....
       AutoRaise delay
              Enables auto-raising of windows and  specifies  the
              time  delay (in milliseconds) between when a window
              acquires the input focus and when it  is  automati-
              cally  raised.  This option works in focus-follows-
              mouse mode, and in click-to-focus mode if the focus
              is  changed  by  clicking in the application window
              instead of a decoration window.  In  click-to-focus
              mode,  you can suppress the raise-on-focus behavior
      -----------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              by specifying a negative delay value.


How can I achieve this with V2?

Thanks,
Jim Ferguson

OK, I've seen enough nice things about TKGoodstuff to give it a try.  I
especially like the window list.  The problem: what do I do with the pager?
TKGoodstuff won't swallow things so I can't treat it normally.  Should I
just put it in a small window off to the side, or should I use FVWMButtons
also?  And what about other useful programs, like my hacked xosview that
puts bunches of little bar graphs in an icon?

Best case senario... you learn tcl/tk and write a TkGoodstuff Client for the 
pager for all of us. :-)

In the meantime I'm keeping mine in a corner of my desktop and bring it to the 
front by clicking on its name in TkGoodstuff's FVWM WindowList.

Hi,

Sorry to be an idiot, but I can't figure this m4 macro language out. I'm
trying to build an .fvwm2rc that will work both at home (on my Linux
box) and at work (Sparcstations). I'd like to use m4 to preprocess the
file, so I can set up paths and the like automatically, and not have
to hand-edit the file every time I copy it from work to home (and vice
versa).

Someone else must be doing this, right? I can't find any actual examples
in the docs or in the archives of this list. Let me just include the
stuff that I've been trying, perhaps some more enlightened soul can
show me where I'm going wrong?


My first effort was to do this:

This is the basic definition, establish the default:

m4_define(`icopath',`/homes/critters/vargish/lib/icons:/var/local/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/local/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps')

Then check the HOSTNAME and change the definition if needed:

m4_ifelse(`HOSTNAME',`imrryr',`m4_define(`icopath',`/homes/nick/lib/icons:/usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps')')

Which didn't really do the trick -- it didn't change the definition. I tried
removing the quotes around the `m4_define(...)' section, but that didn't
help -- it changed the definition every time, even when HOSTNAME was not
defined as imrryr.

Okay, so the second attempt was to do this:

m4_define(`modpath',m4_ifelse(`HOSTNAME',`imrryr',`/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2:/usr/X11R6/bin',`/var/local/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2:/usr/local/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm2:/var/local/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/X11R6/bin'))

But this doesn't work either... When HOSTNAME is imrryr, it still uses the
second definition, the not-clause.

I think I must be confused about m4 quoting rules, but I'm not sure
exactly where I'm going wrong. I'd appreciate any advice people might
have... Examples would be especially welcome -- I learn well from those.

Nick

p.s. Is there any way to make those m4 definitions "prettier"? I'm just not
a big fan of 220-character lines...
