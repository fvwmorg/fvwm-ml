That's not a version number.  If you're using anything earlier
than 2.5.10, upgrade.  If the problem is present with 2.5.10 or
the current CVS code, please give us detailed instructions to
reproduce the problem.

Correct.

no, it redirects the output to fvwm to execute.  FvwmBacker never
gets any reply.

FvwmBacker currently does not support dynamic configuration.  The
colour set number can not be changed without restarting
FvwmBacker.  Actually, this is a problem with most modules, not
just FvwmBacker.  To get around the problem, do this:

  * Name your images bg_1.xpm to bg_<n>.xpm.

  * Reserve a colour set for each background image, e.g.

      Colorset 21 pixmap bg1.xpm
      Colorset 22 pixmap bg2.xpm
      Colorset 23 pixmap bg3.xpm
      ...

    This takes care of caching the images.

  * Make a colour set for FvwmBacker to use:

      Colorset 20 pixmap bg1.xpm
      *FvwmBacker: Command (Desk *) Colorset 20

    Note that the colour set never changes.

  * Use FvwmEvent to change the image in=20

      *FvwmEvent: cmd=20
      *FvwmEvent: new_desk "piperead 'echo colorset 20 pixmap bg_$$[RANDOM =
% 3 + 1].xpm'"

    (replace the 3 with the actual number of images).

Whenever the desk is changes, FvwmEvent updates colour set 20.
This should be fast because the image is already cached.

Ciao

Hello list,

I'm writing a simple module in scheme, just to play a little bit with
fvwm, but i got into serious problems. The Module should just beep. I
think it's sho short and so understandable for even non schemers that i
can post it.

,---- fvwm.scm
| #!/usr/local/bin/gosh
| 
| (define (main args)
|   (let ((ostream (open-output-fd-port
|                   (string->number (list-ref args 1)))))
|     (display "None" ostream)
|     (display 4 ostream)
|     (display "Beep" ostream)
|     (display 0 ostream)))
`----

The error i get is:

[FVWM][HandleModuleInput]: <<ERROR>> Module(3) command is too big
(875573296), limit is 1000

I'm sure it something totally stupid, so please help me...

Mario

    I have in my .fvwm2rc file the following bindings:

# Meta mouse bindings.
Mouse 1		W	M	Lower
Mouse 2		W	M	Move
Mouse 3		W	M	Raise
Mouse 2		W	MC	Resize

  I've used these for years and had them work fine; my fingers are
  very used to them.  However, I recently upgraded my desktop (see
  below) they seem to be completely ignored.  Specifically, the mouse
  clicks in the application window seem to go straight to the
  application.  Is this accurate?  If so, what is the "W" context good
  for?

    My current setup is Mandrake 10.0 running GNOME (2.4.1 or 2.4.2
  depending on which RPMs you trust), with fvwm 2.5.10 grafted in
  underneath as the window manager.  I've done scanning of the
  fvwm.org web page and mailing lists, but found nothing indicating
  how this is supposed to work (and a message or two implying that
  applications are supposed to get all events within application
  windows; i.e. that what I'm trying to do is not allowed).  Can
  anyone give me a more definitive answer?

    Thanks in advance for any help ...

I suppose you want to run a script, not a module (that is not possible in
scheme as of now). In this case you should call it like "Exec script.scm"
and not "Module script.scm".

Mikhael.

No, not really. I want to write a module similar to perllib and use
scheme as language insead of perl. Is there a special C bridge to perl
to realite modules in perl?

The "W' context definitely works, if no, see FAQ #0.1 question.

However the recent behaviour regarding "Move/Resize operations that are
not in a complex function on mouse drag" was changed. So if you want the
operation on press and not on release, rewrite it to use a function:

  Mouse 2               W       M       MyMove

  AddToFunc MyMove
  #+ I Raise
  + I Move

No, there is no C bridge, it is pure perl.

You can't write modules in language X without first implementing some
kind of fvwm module library in X. This may take many months, even if you
just borrow the design from the perl module library (that should highly
simplify the task), or you choose another path and implement a highly
pared library for simple modules only. You may try if you are ready to
get such errors twice a day and are able to solve them on your own.

The developer section of fvwm.org includes all the info you need.
Theoretically, you don't need to learn the fvwm sources, but practically
this may help in your task.

Mikhael.

Latest FVWM CVS crashes(and send me
back to the GDM) with OpenOffice 1.1.
Reproducible steps:
1) start ooimpress
2) create an empty presentation
3) create an empty text document
(using the menu New/Text Document)
4) type anything, select it, press CTRL+C
5) go back to the presentation using
the menu Window/<presentation> window

That's it. It crashes.

"ActiveTitle" specifies what text to display on a button when the mouse
hovers over it. Is this what you want?

This option is a recent addition to FvwmButtons so you will require
a CVS snapshot. (or wait until 2.5.11 comes out)

SCoTT. :)

I'm looking for a something like the balloons that FvwmPager has.  This
would most likely be used on FvwmButtons instances that don't use
titles, just icons.

Thanks,
Ahmed

Try adding a newline at the end of the fvwm command.

I can't reproduce this bug, maybe because I have OO1.1Beta2.  Can
you please send us a stack trace?  Locate the core file that fvwm
leaves, then run: (assuming you compiled with gcc)

  $ gdb fvwm core
  (gdb) where

and post the output.

This might sound like a stupid question, but while you're using X, did
you turn on numlock? I had the same problem, I'd be working and at
seemingly random points, all of my Meta key commands would stop working.
I finally realized it happened when I turned on numlock. There's an
explanation for it floating around if you're interested, but I'm not
completely sure I remember where I saw it. I think it's on fvwm.org in
the FAQ.

If this is the case, put the following in your .fvwm2rc file:

	IgnoreModifiers L25

That will keep the Meta strokes working when numlock is on.

Hi!  I'm a new user of fvwm.  I like it very much but one problem really
stomps me.  My problem is that at some point after starting up X and
fvwm2 (usually after several hours of using it), I suddenly lose some,
but not all, keyboard and mouse bindings.  Here is a list of the
bindings from my .fvwm2rc file, with a note at the beginning of the line
indicating which bindings get lost:

  (Lost)   Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
  (Lost)   Key F1  TSFW M Maximize
  (Lost)   Key F5  TSFW M Raise
  (Lost)   Key F6  TSFW M Lower
  (Lost)   Key F7  A    M Next (AcceptsFocus) FuncFocusRaiseWarp
  (Lost)   Key F8  A    M Prev (AcceptsFocus) FuncFocusRaiseWarp
  (Lost)   Key F9  TSFW M Close
  (OK)     Key F33 A    A Menu MenuMain Nop

  (Lost)   Mouse 1 W       M       FuncMoveOrRaise
  (Lost)   Mouse 2 W       M       FuncResizeOrRaise
  (Lost)   Mouse 3 W       M       Menu MenuWindowOps Nop

  (Lost)  *FvwmIconMan: action      Mouse   3 N sendcommand "FvwmIdent"

It appears that I lose all bindings with the Meta (Alt) modifier, plus
all the mouse buttons in the FvwmIconMan.  By the way, I use a standard
104-key keyboard, and I use xmodmap to map the left and right Windows
keys (on either side of the space bar beyond the left and right Alt
keys) and the Menu key (to the right of the right Windows key) to F33,
F34, and F35, respectively.  Here is my .xmodmap:

  ! 115 is the Left Windows key, w/o a SymName
  keycode 115 =3D F33
  ! 116 is the Right Windows key, w/o a SymName
  keycode 116 =3D F34
  ! 117 is the Menu key, w/o a SymName
  keycode 117 =3D F35

Even after the bindings get lost, I can see that X still gets events
when I press the left and right Alt keys by using xev.  Here is what xev
shows when I hit the (left)Alt-Mouse1, at the time fvwm already does not
seem to get it:

  KeyPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x7200001,
      root 0x3a, subw 0x0, time 203590265, (135,87), root:(261,349),
      state 0x10, keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L), same_screen YES,
      XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

  ButtonPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x7200001,
      root 0x3a, subw 0x0, time 203590925, (135,87), root:(261,349),
      state 0x18, button 1, same_screen YES

  ButtonRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x7200001,
      root 0x3a, subw 0x0, time 203591908, (135,87), root:(261,349),
      state 0x118, button 1, same_screen YES

  MotionNotify event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x7200001,
      root 0x3a, subw 0x0, time 203592010, (134,87), root:(260,349),
      state 0x18, is_hint 0, same_screen YES

  KeyRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x7200001,
      root 0x3a, subw 0x0, time 203592603, (134,87), root:(260,349),
      state 0x18, keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L), same_screen YES,
      XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""

Reinitializing fvwm does not solve the problem, and neither does killing
the fvwm process and restarting it from the command-line.  It seems the
only way to make the bindings come back once I lose them is to quit the
X server altogether.

Has any of you encounter such a problem before?  Any ideas on how to fix
it?

Thanks,
-yossi

This used to work in twm with command 
xterm ...  -n NAME -T NAME  but not in fvwm2

Thanks,
Mark

This is probably a facet of how your shell handles the $PROMPT_COMMAND .
In my ~/.bashrc I have:

``
   # If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
    case $TERM in
    #xterm*)
    #    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}:
${PWD}\007"'    #    ;;
    *)
        ;;
    esac
''

Change that as appropriate.

Yes, I guess, what you do in your email signature do not interest
anybody. As well as your attacks on GPL and GNU. Now, if you write
some really good free software, this would be more interesting.

FvwmTaskBar just watches a file for new mails.  You could use some
other program such as fetchmail to download the mails to a local
file.  If this is inacceptable, you can make some external script
that checks for new mail and writes something to a fake mailbox,
e.g.:

  #!/bin/sh
  echo > /tmp/have_new_mail
  while true; do
    if new_mail_in_imap_box; then
      echo "new mail" >> /tmp/have_new_mail
    fi
    sleep 300
  done

And tell FvwmTaskBar to watch the /tmp/have_new_mail file instead
of a real mailbox:

  *FvwmTaskBar: MailBox /tmp/have_new_mail

The difficult part is to write the "new_mail_in_imap_box" command
or function.  Since I never used IMAP, I don't know what tools
there are to do it.

Ciao

fetchmail may be used to check (or fetch) email on the mail server that
uses POP, IMAP and other protocols. I once played with fetchmail and
found it not configurable enough, however you may add missing
functionality by scripting.

Add one line to ~/.fetchmailrc like:

  skip mail.your-server.com proto imap username uday_p password your_passwd

Then execute:

  fetchmail -c                           mail.your-server.com
  fetchmail -c -r mail/FVWM              mail.your-server.com
  fetchmail -c -r mail/Other-Mail-Folder mail.your-server.com

As I said, you need some parsing of the output to actually tell whether
there is an email in one of the folders, it outputs:

  1623 messages (1621 seen) for uday_p at your-server.com (folder mail/FVWM).

Mikhael.

of course not, was that the reason I mentioned it?

Well I posted two links. They are meant for informational
purpose. How does it come you see that as an 'attack'? Maybe
those links attack FSF, but I just provide the links as info,
and as a sign that I believe it to some degree, I removed the
GNU part in the sig therefore.

of course.

Hi,
I have the following setup for a menu:


AddToMenu RootMenu      "Windows"       Title
+                       "Move"          Move
+                       "Resize"        Resize
....

and 

Mouse 2 R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop

Why is it that once I open the menu with middle
mouse button and unwillingly click
on the top (Title) a new window pops up with
RootMenu and how to get rid of this?
Thanks,
Mark

It's a default binding, you can just undefine it if you

I don't see any constructive reasons to post these anti-GPL links to
the mailing list that is all about the project licensed under GNU GPL.
I can't define it other than a provocation against the fvwm developers.
Unintentional, I suppose.

Ok, as your grasp of the English language appears limited, I'll spell out
what should have been obvious from the replies to your initial post:

Please do NOT send grossly off-topic posts to this list. In case it's
not clear, this list is for discussion about the FVWM window-manager -
this is NOT the forum to discuss personal views on GPL/GNU.

I can succesfully use gnome icons with semi-auto updates on root menu.
Here is how it works.

###################################################################
SetEnv fvwm_icons $[HOME]/.icons/Marcintesh_OS-W/
#
#
#
+   "System"%$[fvwm_icons]192x192/apps/gnome-system.png%           
Popup MenuSystem
+   "Office"%$[fvwm_icons]192x192/apps/gnome-applications.png%        
     Popup MenuOffice
###################################################################

And so on... Now next time when I need to change the icons. I just
need to change the fvwm_icons path. But as you might have guessed,
there is one big problem with it. The icons are too huge.. Is there a
way to resize them before using? I know there is since there is a
wallpaper browser that does the same thing for every PNGs in a
wallpaper directory.
Here is the code for that..

###################################################################
#### Browse Wallpapers Directory
DestroyFunc WallpaperBrowser
AddToFunc WallpaperBrowser
+ I PipeRead 'test ! -d "$0/.thumbs" && mkdir "$0/.thumbs"; \
    for i in "$0/"*; do \
        test -f "$0/.thumbs/${i##*/}" \
            -a "${i}" -ot "$0/.thumbs/${i##*/}" || { \
                convert -quality 0 -scale 24 "${i}"
"png:$0/.thumbs/${i##*/}" 2>/dev/null \
                    || continue; \
            }; \
    done; \
    fvwm-menu-directory --icon-title icons/blue/browse.png --icon-file
__PIXMAP__ \
    --icon-dir icons/blue/browse.png --dir $0 --exec-file "^Esetroot -s" \
    --exec-t="^eog *" | sed -e "s#FuncFvwmMenuDirectory#WallpaperBrowser#g" \
    -e "s#__PIXMAP__\\(.*\\)\\"\\(.*/\\)\\(.*\\)\\"#\\2.thumbs/\\3\\1\\2\\3#g"'
###################################################################

There is one more thing that needs to be taken care of.. Setting a
fallback icons that can be used when the icons doesnt exist in
fvwm_icons. Complete icon set is pretty rare in gnome stock icons, so
the menu should be able to use pre specified icons when the default
ones (fvwm_icons) are missing.

As you can guess, I am trying to get a semi-automated icon updates for
menu, but since I have no skills in bash scripting, I will be forever
thankful to you while updating the icons, If someone can be kind
enough to do the hard job :)

Thanks.

Currently there is no way to cause fvwm to resize icons in the menu
automatically. You may resize them on the fly like you suggest, but I
can't recommend this. It would be very slow to resize dozens of icons.

Instead, I may suggest a solution that wm-icons project uses. Prepare all
your complete icon sets before you use them (find appropriate large icons
and resize them using convert). Then your config may look like:

  ImagePath $[HOME]/.fvwm/gnome-icons:+

  +   "System%menu/gnome-system.png%"  Popup MenuSystem
  +   "Office%menu/gnome-applications.png%"  Popup MenuOffice

And you have these subdirectories in ~/.fvwm/gnome-icons/ dir:

  22x22-Marcintesh_OS-W/  with gnome-system.png resized to 22x22
  22x22-Windertosh_OS-M/  with gnome-system.png resized to 22x22

  menu - a symbolic link to the actual icon set, 22x22-Marcintesh_OS-W

To chenge an icon set, just replace the 'menu' symbolic link (ln -sfn)
and reread the menu definition (or do Restart).

> There is one more thing that needs to be taken care of.. Setting a
> fallback icons that can be used when the icons doesnt exist

You may make your icon sets complete by taking icons from another
incomplete icon sets in GNOME. Or you may create one complete
~/.fvwm/gnome-icons/default set and have all missing icons like
~/.fvwm/gnome-icons/Golden/gnome-game.png to be symlinks to
../default/gnome-game.png.

As you see, my suggestion is not fully automatical and requires some
manual work of preparing icons sets, but it produces the best results
once done. Maybe someone who uses GNOME may suggest the actual code to
automate the creation of such complete resized icon sets.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Here is the bash script I wrote to convert icons for my menus:
#menuconvert.sh
#----Menu converting script:
#by: Ahmed Abdalla
#!/bin/bash
#
#This changes the current directory to the fonts directory.
cd /mnt/space/images/icons  ###You will need to change this to 
# your icon folder
#These two lines remove old versions of the icons in case
# there have been changes.
rm -f menu.*
rm -f sidemenu.*
#Sets the variable flist to the list of files in the icon folder
flist="*"
#Starts a loop for all files in the directory.
for file in $flist
do
#These two lines create two sets of icons, one set (20x20)
# for the root menu, and the other set for my side menus (40x40)
convert -scale 20x20 ${file} menu.${file}
convert -scale 40x40 ${file} sidemenu.${file}
#Closes the for loop
done
#Lists all the files in the icon folders
ls /mnt/space/images/icons/
#Prints out 
echo done
# Prints "done" to stdout.
###  EOF

As you can see, it is pretty simple.  The ls and echo commands aren't
needed, as you probably will want this script to be automated as well,
to reflect any changes in the icon directory, every five minutes, for
example.  Just copy this to a file and give it a+rx permissions and you
should be able to execute it ./menuconvert.sh (or whatever you choose to
call it), or you can write in into an fvwm function as needed.

I hope that helps, at least with converting icons,

Hey Ahmed,
Thanks a lot for that script. That would work wonderfully!
I can do this.. 

###################################################################
SetEnv fvwm_icons $[HOME]/.fvwm/images/icons/current/
#
#
#
+   "System"%$[fvwm_icons]menu.gnome-system.png%      Popup MenuSystem
+   "Office"%$[fvwm_icons]menu.gnome-applications.png%      Popup MenuOffice
###################################################################

And just overwrite with new icons in directory
~/.fvwm/images/icons/current/ and run that script again.
Thanks man.. Its a sure way to get all the sweet gnome icons with
virtually no work at all!

Just one more small thing? Can that script convert icons in recursive
manner?! Yeah, I am THAT lazy :P

It's a feature that allows pinning menus to the desktop (aka "tear
off menus").  Usually - for example in gimp - there is a dashed
horizontal bar at the top of a menu that can be clicked to tear a
menu off.  But fvwm supports tearing off for all menus, and
clicking with button 2 on the title bar is one way to achieve this
(pressing Backspace is another).

Unfortunately there is no way to close a tear off menu with the
mouse yet.

> and how to get rid of this?

What Tavis said.  You can close tear off menus by pressing Escape
with the mouse over the menu window.

Ciao

My tear off menus have a window title and frame.
I can click on the titlebar close button with the mouse to close the
menu.

I've attached a new version of the script.  It reports an error:
/bin/recursivemenuconvert.sh: line 20: [: too many arguments, but this
doesn't effect function, and, quite honestly, I couldn't find where the
error, if any, was.  If you want to debug it, feel free (I would like to
know my mistake).

ps.  If the file attachment gets stripped by a mail client or service, I
can email it to you inline.

Thanks, but it does not look that it works though.
I exited and restarted fvwm but no change.
Here is my mouse setup for the menu 

Mouse 1 R       A       Menu Window-Ops Nop
Mouse 2 R       A       Menu RootMenu Nop
Mouse 3 R       A       Menu Utilities Nop
Mouse 2 M       N -

Any tips?
Thanks,
Mark

Hi,
I can't figure out erratic behavior of 

Style *           MouseFocusClickRaises

in my .fvwm2rc.  
 
It seems to work or not at random. 
My other focus commands are

ColormapFocus FollowsMouse
Style *           FocusFollowsMouse

Sometimes it helps to exit window manager altogether
but not always.
Can someone help finding the problem?

My .xsession errors looks like this:
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/sys.xsession: line 1: export:
`ESC[HESC[2JLESSKEY=/etc/lesskey.bin': not a valid
identifier

and I am not sure whether this matters or not

Thanks,
Mark

No, that has nothing to do with fvwm.

Hello,

It's my perception that the mouse-triggered actions behave
inconsistently with what the manual says.

Specifically, actions don't seem to be triggered until a click is
completed - not on mouse-down - which is what is suggested by the manual.

Take for example this quote from the fvwm man page:

"The name must not contain embedded whitespace. No guarantees are made
whether function names with embedded whitespace work or not. This
behavior may also change in the future without further notice. The
letter before the action tells what kind of action triggers the command
which follows it. 'I' stands for "Immediate", and is executed as soon as
the function is invoked. 'M' stands for "Motion", i.e. if the user
starts moving the mouse. 'C' stands for "Click", i.e., if the user
presses and releases the mouse. 'H' stands for "Hold", i.e. if the user
presses a mouse button and holds it down for more than ClickTime
milliseconds. 'D' stands for "Double-click". The action 'I' causes an
action to be performed on the button-press, if the function is invoked
with prior knowledge of which window to act on."

This suggests that "Immediate" commands are executed on mouse-down,
while "Click" type is for press-and-release.

I've noticed that Immediate commands are only exceuted after release or
I press and move the pointer a bit. This is certainly not "Immediate" -
and there is a definite need for commands to be executed on mousedown.

In fact, for all mouse-bindings, actions are excuted on
click-and-release instead of mousedown. Key binding actions are executed
on mouse-down.

And also - there is this entry in the FvwmButtons manpage:

"ActionOnPress
~~    Usually the action is executed on the button release except for the
Popup action. This option changes this behavior, the action is executed
on the button press. This may be good, for example, with Menu or
SendToModule that generates popups, or when Frame is 0 and the button
would look unresponsive otherwise."

This suggests that popup actions are executed on mousedown. This is not
the case with buttons. They behave like "Immediate" commands - executing
only on mousedown+movement or mousedown+release.

If I add ActionOnPress, actions behave like "Immediate" commands again -
that is - not immediately!

Incidentally, popup menus only behave correctly in keybindings and
mousebindings on the Root Desktop.

Can anyone shed some light on this issue? It's a major annoyance.

This is strange, I can't reproduce any of these 2 problems, just tested.

Please create and post here a minimal fvwmrc file that has one function,
one problematic binding and a minimal FvwmButtons configuration opening
MenuFvwmRoot (this menu is globally defined).

Please always specify your fvwm version.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ok, I didn't know the FVWM windows-manager has nothing to do with licences.

Well, I meant something like that *COULD* or could *not* be a good idea (It
could matter or it could not matter. In fact most likely it will not matter,
and even more important, I do ABSOLUTELY not matter what kind of software fvwm
uses, and that was probably a quite errorful ?English? sentence.)

-------------------------------------------------------
Read the licenses carefully and rip out parts which give
Stallman any possibility to influence your future.  Phrases like

   [...] GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
   Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your
   option) any later version.
-------------------------------------------------------

Well may replace the lesser version with the standard version AND I do
personally *not* care whatever you do with the fvwm-licence!

-------------------------------------------------------
The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation
of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a
monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software
Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.
-------------------------------------------------------

No, I do not attack the GNU GPL really.

No, I do *NOT* accect rude things against me, when I only want to 'share' (what
I think) interesting links. Which were especially interesting links for me,
because I had quite a different view before, and I think I was wrong.

And saying it's my fault, that people are rude against me, just because I post
two links, is not acceptable (for me), or let's say I have better to do, therefore

bye bye 

Scotty and Mikhael.

Hello list,
	Is there any possible emulation of kde's system tray in fvwm? 
Lots of gtk and kde programs is able to minimize into the tray, such as gaim, kopete.	
But I don't really wanna to start a gnome-panel, it brings up  too much things.

   Thanks in advance.

But the greatest Electrical Pioneer of them all was Thomas Edison, who
was a brilliant inventor despite the fact that he had little formal
education and lived in New Jersey.  Edison's first major invention in
1877, was the phonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of
American homes, where it basically sat until 1923, when the record was
invented.  But Edison's greatest achievement came in 1879, when he
invented the electric company.  Edison's design was a brilliant
adaptation of the simple electrical circuit: the electric company sends
electricity through a wire to a customer, then immediately gets the
electricity back through another wire, then (this is the brilliant
part) sends it right back to the customer again.

This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch
of electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since
very few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely.
In fact the last year any new electricity was generated in the United
States was 1937; the electric companies have been merely re-selling it
ever since, which is why they have so much free time to apply for rate
increases.

fvwm-2.5.10-r6 is what I'm using.

This is an example of what doesn't work:

*module-buttons-applist: (1x1, Icon MiniIcon, ActionOnPress, Action
(Mouse 1) WindowList NoGeometry NoDeskNum MaxLabelWidth 50 NoIcons)

The plot thickens: When any modifier is pressed, including NumLock,
everything functions exactly as the manual says.

Greetings

I've been using fvwm for quite some time and it has landed to my desktop
systems as my favourite solution.

Now with the coming of xorg x11 however I have bumped into a minor glitch as I
would like to use my multimedia keyboard to it's full extent. I put a posting
onto my current distributions forum [1] which describes my problems in the
easiest way.

Perhaps I could get hints from this list on the problem. :)

And it is exactly what fvwm does.  With

  AddToFunc immediate I echo immediate
  mouse 3 r n function immediate

the "echo immediate" is executed as soon the button is pressed,
and with=20

  AddToFunc click C echo click
  mouse 3 r n function click

There are a couple of exception, though:

 - If an application is started that tries to grab control of the
   pointer, it will succeed only after the function is completed.
 - Commands that change the window focus do change the foucs
   immediately, but the window decorations are redrawn only after
   the function completes.  Fvwm tracks the focused window by the
   corresponding X event, and events are not handled during
   function execution.  Hence the delay.
 - To suppress excessive redrawing, changes in window styles are
   activated only after the function completes and fvwm is idle
   (i.e. not receiving events or module input).
 - If a command needs a window to operate on, and no window has
   been selected yet, you have to release the button first and
   then click on a window.

Note that the function itself only completes when the last mouse
button is released.

Works as advertised for me.

Is there any chance your mouse or your X server is broken?  When
fvwm receives a ButtonPress event it acts immediately.

Please use a shorter signature.  Anything longer than 4 lines is
considered impolite by the netiquette rules.  Usually people do
not care much, but 23 lines (5 times the size of the email text)
is definitely too long.

As you seem to be using fortune to generate signatures, I suggest
running it with

  $ fortune -n 240 -s

to generate only short fortunes (240 characters or less).

Ciao

The problem keys don't seem to be listed in your xev output...  perhaps
your keyboard is using different keycodes than the ones you used in your
xkb symbols file?

Run

  $ xmodmap -pke

to see whether these keys are configured properly.

Well, could we please agree that this is all a misunderstanding?

 * Marco wanted to point out a discussion about licensing he
   thought to be of interest.
 * As it turns out, said discussion is very emotional and is
   considered unproductive by some of the developers.  I am not
   offended personally, but I understand why others are.
 * People misinterpreted the intention of the email and replied
   impatiently which Marco thought to be rude.  Nobody wanted to
   be rude, they just wanted to stifle the flaming that they
   believed to follow.
 * Flaming is grossly off topic, but licensing issues are not.  I
   am always interested in such information.
 * Questioning Marco's grasp on the English language to stop a
   mail thread *is* rude.

Ciao

Looks like I copypasted a bit wrongly to the forum, but the keys are listed:
KeyPress event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x1200001,
    root 0x76, subw 0x0, time 82248, (97,94), root:(936,125),
    state 0x0, keycode 230 (keysym 0x1008ff5f, XF86Go), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:=20
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:=20
    XFilterEvent returns: False

KeyPress event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x1200001,
    root 0x76, subw 0x0, time 81088, (97,94), root:(936,125),
    state 0x0, keycode 236 (keysym 0x1008ff19, XF86Mail), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:=20
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:=20
    XFilterEvent returns: False

Hmmm... XF86Search has a wrong code though... Must have misread that one. :)

Interesting, the Search and Go keys are giving the same keycode to me at the
moment:

KeyPress event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x2a00001,
    root 0x76, subw 0x0, time 3523077, (15,88), root:(1164,1103),
    state 0x0, keycode 230 (keysym 0x1008ff5f, XF86Go), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XFilterEvent returns: False

KeyPress event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x2a00001,
    root 0x76, subw 0x0, time 3523610, (15,88), root:(1164,1103),
    state 0x0, keycode 230 (keysym 0x1008ff5f, XF86Go), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XFilterEvent returns: False


Oh well, hadn't noticed that before. :)

Okay, fvwm works great, looks like this rolls towards xorg configs... For some
reason the "looking glass" and "running dude" buttons on my keyboard give the
same keycode with xorg x11.

Thanks for the help. :)

My mistake was actually in my config... and those really smart absolute paths to
commands...

Please don't. It is like to be offended if pointed to FAQ #0.1.

I really hoped to avoid any discussion, because this list does not deal
with the software licenses, but you continue to force these links as
something "interesting", so it seems that some clarification may help.

In my opinion, this is a paranoid statement that does not match the
predictable behaviour of RMS. Don't forget we all use his definition of
Free Software (four basic freedoms if you remember), because this is the
only widely accepted definition. There is no other man to be as
consistent and persistent regarding Free Software as RMS. I met him in
the real life once, so I may say this. He is a hippie; stating he worries
about his own personal glory and profit (or even better "control of the
world") is nothing but false.

Returning to the GPL or LGPL license tweaking. Developers may use any
license they want, but they should be aware, if they change the canonical
license, the software is no longer freely mixable with all other software
under the canonical license. If you want to be the most helpful to
others, use the canonical license, don't invent your own changes to it,
there is no need to have isolated sets of GPL'd and almost GPL'd software.

> No, I do not attack the GNU GPL really.

You posted a link to the article titled "GPL bad".  Anti-GPL articles
(especially the ones that can't even expand "GPL" acronym correctly) are
not welcome on this list. The topology site is down, but Google has the
cached version.

The same article has multiple attacks on FSF, and even on OSI. I would
say, at least the topology site is a set of anti Free Software articles.
Such attacks on GPL, GNU and FSF are not new. Certain all-known companies
use similar FUD arguments.

This is a technical list, there are normally no personal (political)
discussions here, this one is a sorry exception.

I think I explained why these links are off-topic and a bit rude to the
fvwm developers that believe in Free Software.

You should accept that this is a two edged sword. There are some rules
that define offtopic messages rude, top-posts rude, huge signatures
rude, posting links that may annoy the developers rude and so on.

FWIW, the "or any later version" bit isn't part of the license itself,
but rather the suggested usage of the license (under the 'How to Apply
These Terms to Your New Programs' section, after the terms and
conditions.)  The Linux kernel, for example, doesn't include the '...any
later version' wording; in fact, it explicitly states this to not be so
(see COPYING in the top of the kernel source tree.)

This is incorrect. Download the license text (GNU GPL version 2), it
includes the canonical wording at lines 299.

As for the kernel, yes, I can't freely mix any code from the kernel to
fvwm since the licenses are almost the same, but not the same. This only
proves my point. Most of the software uses the canonical GPL v2+, so
there is no any problem to mix between fvwm and other such software.

Regards,
Mikhael.

yes, I did take that personally, I'm quite sensible in things like that, and I
think that is good. There are too many freaking rude people around.

yes, I recognized that and changed it yesterday, thx.

Thanks for the explanation about the licences, yet I can/want not
comment that. I just posted two links, where I still mean, even
they are probably exaggerated, are interesting links.

So let's say in fact I would come up with a big license change suggestion -
what I don't care about in fact and you probably wouldn't either - where
would I have to post that? So let's say it's something really 'serious'. I
can't post into fvwm, nor fvwm-workers?  It seems to be all over off-topic.

cya,
calmar

I think if you want to submit a patch to the license you should
use fvwm-workers.

Based on the responses you've gotten so far from some of the primary
workers, I don't think you are going to get very far.

Rather than posting links, I think you should describe the problem
it is causing you and the benefits to the fvwm project that would
be gained.

Strange, "cya" only means one thing to me...
Oh, ok "see you"?

Yes, but the actual software is licensed under either canonical GPL v2+,
or under GPL v2-only (more strict), or under GPL plus some additional
permissions (less strict). All these are not compatible in the long run.
This was all discussed on the internet I suppose; if you really want, you
may find the discussions. The summary is, if I copy a code from some
kernel file licensed under GPL v2-only to fvwm.c licensed under the
canonical GPL v2+, the kernel guy has all the rights to sue me.

So, let's stop here. Just like GPL v2 is a fixed version of v1 and noone
uses v1-only now, the v3 may be a fixed version of v2 if some legal
problems are found, in this case no one will use v2 anymore. I would
suggest to use the canonical GPL v2+ (or just GPL for short) for all
new code if you want to avoid any legal problems now or in the future.

Regards,
Mikhael.

On the contrary, everyone that has any control over the licensing
seems to be in agreement.

I think, despite some miscommunication, this discussion has remained
relatively civil.  Check out the yahoo messages boards or Usenet if
you want to see real conflict.  I'd look into the Litestep controversy
but for the last few years, my life has been free from the windows curse.

Hi,

I have some few problems regarding desktop
environment.

Here's my scenario:

I'm using KDE and I never used any other desktop
environment before.
I already know that KDE consists of the following
which I need in accomplishing my daily tasks:

-an internet browser/file manager
-an office suite
-and a Window Manager

Now, what I always wanted to do is to try to use any
other desktop environment which didn't came up in a
package like KDE, meaning, a separate internet
browser, window manager, file manager etc, and learn
how these sorts of stuff work together.

I've already installed FVWM 2.4.18 in my FreeBSD 4.10.
After successful installation and through careful
guessing, when I typed startx, I landed on a pink
desktop with a rectangular bar in the lower right with
a clock at the far right corner of it.

I have browsed the xman and found a very little help.
I have few questions in this list.

How should I install a file manager, or a web browser.
If I will do it in the xterm, where will the newly
installed app, be placed? And where should I begin if
I would want to have a beautiful desktop like what the
screenshots in fvwm.org is displaying?

For ease of instruction, please advice me based on
what desktop components you are using right now(eg;
file manager, web browser..) and I will just make my
own choice regarding those components when I am
already familiar in putting those things up and
running in FVWM.

I really recommend you install 2.5.10, since you'll need this version to
use transparency, should you want it. It also has a few more features,
and despite the fact it is the 'Unstable' version, I have found it to be
anything but.

Welcome to FVWM. Perhaps it is similar to this one:

http://linuxgazette.net/105/adam.html

> I have few questions in this list.

"man fvwm" contains everything you'll ever need. It's all there.

> How should I install a file manager, or a web browser.

By whatever means FreeBSD uses, of course. If you mean which, well,
there are lots. I like and use "moxfm" (motid x-file-manager), but many
advocate "rox" (http://rox.sf.net), and I too used it for a while.

> If I will do it in the xterm, where will the newly

Using an xterm bears no relation on installation. For *BSD, all files
are placed in /usr/local/*, and one assumes this will be in your $PATH.

> screenshots in fvwm.org is displaying?

At the beginning. Don't run before you can walk. Take things a step at a

I now realize that it's somewhere within my configuration files that is causing 
this. The Sample95 configuration does not have this behavior.

My configuration files are based on fvwm-crystal. Any idea about what settings 
could cause this glitch?

I am using a dailybuild from the 16th. Im not sure if this is
reproducible on other people box.

But whenever i try to define a custom font for FvwmTaskBar's StatusFont
as such

*FvwmTaskBar:StatusFont-artwiz-snap-medium-r-normal-*-10-100-75-75-p-90-*-irv

The clock's fg is always black regardless of my colorset settings for
FvwmTaskBar

Am i doing something wrong? Can other people reproduce this on their
boxes? thanks a lot in advance

David

|
|
| And it is exactly what fvwm does.  With
|
|   AddToFunc immediate I echo immediate
|   mouse 3 r n function immediate
|
| the "echo immediate" is executed as soon the button is pressed,
| and with
|
|   AddToFunc click C echo click
|   mouse 3 r n function click
|
| There are a couple of exception, though:
|
|  - If an application is started that tries to grab control of the
|    pointer, it will succeed only after the function is completed.
|  - Commands that change the window focus do change the foucs
|    immediately, but the window decorations are redrawn only after
|    the function completes.  Fvwm tracks the focused window by the
|    corresponding X event, and events are not handled during
|    function execution.  Hence the delay.
|  - To suppress excessive redrawing, changes in window styles are
|    activated only after the function completes and fvwm is idle
|    (i.e. not receiving events or module input).
|  - If a command needs a window to operate on, and no window has
|    been selected yet, you have to release the button first and
|    then click on a window.
|
| Note that the function itself only completes when the last mouse
| button is released.
|

Nope - I still get my old behavior. And I don't think I have anything wrong with
my X-server.

I use x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r2

Hello fvwm developers,

I need to set the hostname of my machine dynamically within the .fvwm2rc =
file.

Unfortunately the command evaluation within back ticks

	SetEnv  HOSTNAME `/bin/hostname`

does not work.

Is there another possibility to do it within .fvwm2rc (or a syntax error =
within the line shown above) ?

Unfortunately I did not find anything appropriate in the manual.

Thank you for your assistance

	Frank

One way to do it is to use a PipeRead:

PipeRead 'echo "SetEnv FRANK `hostname`"'
Echo $[FRANK]

I just tried to set up a second root menu by splitting my current root
menu (MenuFvwmRoot) into two separate menus (MenuFvwmLeftRoot,
MenuFvwmRightRoot).  However, when I bind these two menus to mouse 1 and
mouse 3, they cause fvwm to take forever to start or restart.  This does
not occur when I change the bindings back to mouse 1 by itself. 
Previously, mouse 3 was bound to open MenuFvwmRoot as well, with no
problems.  The delays are reproducible every time I change the mouse 3
bindings.  There is no output from /var/log/messages or .xsession-errors
that seem to be spawned by fvwm and related to the mouse.  I have tried
the bindings with IgnoreModifiers L25 set and commented out, and the
delays are still present, either way.  I have read through the man page
and have not found anything that would cause this.

Many thanks,
Ahmed

For a nice initial fvwm setup, you may use the fvwm-themes
package from http://fvwm-themes.sf.net/.  You can them modify the
configuration.

fvwm and all the modules have man pages.

That depends on the program.  Personally I use the midnight
commander as a text based file manager.  It comes with virtually
all distributions, so you don't have to worry about where it is
installed.

If you use mozilla as your browser, you can download the latest
=2Etar.gz package from www.mozilla.org (current version: 1.7.2) and
unpack it to /usr/local/mozilla.  Then add

  PATH=3D"$PATH:/usr/local/mozilla"

to your PATH settings.

Many people want most of the following components on their
desktop:

 * A clock.  I use xclock, but there are many others: rclock,
   asclock, daliclock, kclock ...
 * A system meter, for example xload, xosview, ...
 * An icon manager that displays and controls iconified windows.
   Fvwm offers a couple of alternatives:  the modules FvwmIconMan,
   FvwmWinList, FvwmIconBox or FvwmTaskBar (I recommend
   FvwmIconMan) or the WindowList command.
 * A mini representation of the desktop and the windows.  This is
   done by the FvwmPager module.
 * A bar that swallows other modules and applications, and has
   buttons to invoke menus, and other actions.  Use the
   FvwmButtons module.  My FvwmButtons contains xload, xosview,
   xclock FvwmPager and FvwmIconMan and has a number of buttons
   and menus.
 * The FvwmConsole module.  Start it from a root menu entry or put
   a button in the FvwmButtons box.  It is a console window that
   allows you to issue fvwm commands without restarting the window
   manager.  Very useful.
 * An X console window to display X and fvwm error messages.

Some other useful modules

 * FvwmAuto to raise/lower windows automatically.
 * FvwmBacker to set the desktop background.
 * FvwmIdent to display some window information (for debugging)

Please strip down your config as much as possible so that the
problem is still present and post it to the mailing list.

This bug has already been fixed in the development code.  The fix
will be published in fvwm-2.4.19 and fvwm-2.5.11.  If you need the
fix urgently, you have to download fvwm from CVS.

Hello,
I am sure this has been asked million times, but it seems my grepmail
usage is not so good. So,
How can one destroy (for good) the buttons definitions on titlebar?
I have managed to make them not seen, but when I move cursor on top of
where I know the button (say, winopts menu) is, the cursor changes.
I wouldn't want to see at all the buttons nr. 1 and 3.
Thanks,
mikko (@medusa.tutka.fi , I've not subscribed atm)

The stripped config is attached.  I left just enough in it so that it
will boot and you can maybe see where the problem is.  I reinstalled
fvwm, and the problem has continued.

Many thanks,
Ahmed

hi, 

I'm trying to use 2 Hiddenconsoles on my fvwm-Destop. But it is not
working. Only one Console "pops down", when I move my Mouse above it!

Here is my Config:


AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmAuto FvwmAutohide -menter FuncAutoEnter
+ I StartHiddenConsole
+ I StartHiddenConsole1

DestroyFunc StartHiddenConsole
AddToFunc StartHiddenConsole
+ I Exec exec Eterm --options .... -n "HiddenConsole"

DestroyFunc StartHiddenConsole1
AddToFunc StartHiddenConsole1
+ I Exec exec Eterm --options .... -n "HiddenConsole1"

DestroyFunc FuncAutoEnter
AddToFunc FuncAutoEnter
+ I Autohide HiddenConsole1 500 500 N
+ I Autohide HiddenConsole 250 500 N

AddToFunc Autohide
+ I ThisWindow ($0) Deschedule $[w.id]
+ I TestRc (!Match) Deschedule -$[w.id]
+ I ThisWindow ($0) ThisWindow (shaded) AutohideShow $1 $3
+ I TestRc (!Match) All ($0, !shaded) AutohideHide $2 $3

AddToFunc AutohideShow
+ I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] WindowShade $1 off
+ I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] Raise
+ I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] Deschedule $[w.id]
+ I Schedule $0 -$[w.id] Deschedule -$[w.id]

AddToFunc AutohideHide
+ I Schedule $0 $[w.id] WindowShade $1 on
+ I Schedule $0 $[w.id] Deschedule $[w.id]
+ I Schedule $0 $[w.id] Deschedule -$[w.id]

Please Help me .. ;) Thanks steve

I have tried other people's configs and restarting takes no time at
all.  I am assuming the issue is in my config, but I have yet to find
what it is.

Thanks,
Ahmed

I see.  My script is broken.  The second call of Autohide:

  + I Autohide HiddenConsole 250 500 N

always deschedules the AutohideShow from the first call.  I can't
think of a simple way to fix this from the top of my head.

> Destroy MenuFvwmRightRoot
  ^^^^^^^

This command looks for a window to destroy and waits for a button
press.  You have to use DestroyMenu here too.

Did you read the Dan's reply? It answers this. It's very simple, really.
I am not sure why this unproductive thread should be continued still.

If you are an author, you have a say on your part of the code in case the
license ever changes. No, the fvwm license is not going to change any
time soon, because the developers agree about the current license.

If you see anyone violating the GPL, write to gnu.org and fvwm-workers.
FSF should be informed, so their lawyers help to deal with this, since
the fvwm authors don't have free software lawyers on their own.

If you disagree with the Free Software philosophy and GPL specifically,
don't develop fvwm, noone forces you to. You may still run it freely.

If you want to simply rant about GNU GPL, these lists are not the place.

Here, "you" means "someone", this is a generic, not a personal answer.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Some of the windows in our app are set up to open with their top left =
corner where the mouse pointer is. If the mouse pointer is next to the =
right or bottom of the screen, the windows are opening up partially off =
the screen. Is there a Style that can be set to ensure the windows will =
be placed completely on the screen?

Thanks,
Garron Moore

This is an automated response. ... 

Thanks for writing. I have been overwhelmed with an tremendous response to the my latest columns.

I am reading them all, but cannot respond to them all. However many of your emails will be quoted in future columns, or put on a web page (with writers' names removed) for all readers to review.

I appreciate your interest in this subject.

www.twobarleycorns.net, home of the tkcvs web page and some fvwm decors,
is having temporary DNS problems because my ISP re-arranged all its
servers.  For tkcvs, you can download from sourceforge, but the fvwm eye
candy may be unreachable for a day or two. Don't give up on me just yet,
I may be down but I'm not out.

Hi,
I would like to change the behaviour of the started  applications,
so that they dont steal focus from the task that has focus right now.

For example, if im writing in gvim, and I open firefox, and continue to
write in gvim ( hoping that firefox will open in the background, now
that gvim has focus and priority) instead firefox steals focus and takes
over the screen area.

This situation happens with every application.
I've used google and searched the man pages also, but could not find any
answer to this.

I hope someone can help me with this issue.

Thanks,
--

Here is an example from my .fvwmrc

Style "*" Button 1, Button 2, Button 4, Button 6, GrabFocusOff
.
.
Style XTerm*  EWMHMiniIconOverride, ..., GrabFocus

In the first example, none of the windows will grab (or steal) focus..
In the second example, only the terminal window is allowed to do so.
Hope thats what you were looking for.
Regards.

I don't think so. Quotes are fully optional here. The order of Style
lines matters though.

Hello FVWM team,

since SuSE 9.1 which is shiped with FVWM 2.5.9-38
my .fvwm2rc configuration file is not properly loaded anymore,
but can be started with FVWM 2.4.x without any problems.

The problem is that the Module FvwmButtons creating a CDE-like panel =
does not start anymore.

Even the newest version 2.5.10 fails and gives the following error =
message :

     MyMainButtonBox: Button out of horizontal range. Quitting.

The module FvwmButtons is used to replicate a CDE-like panel.

=3D>     Module FvwmButtons MyMainButtonBox

I am not sure if it is a bug, but the 2.5.x version included in SuSE 9.0 =
accepted my .fvwm2rc while 2.5.10 does not.

Please find enclosed my .fvwmrc file for error tracking ?
The size of the file .fvwm2rc is about 140 kB (see attached tar file).

If you like I can also send all files and pixmaps referenced by =
.fvwm2rc,
but they are not neccessary to reproduce the error.

My fvwm2 configuration is comparably complex and the complete package
including all files and pixmaps referenced takes about 30 MB.

Is there a possibility to upload this package to a dedicated FTP server =
?

Please find also enclosed a picture (fvwm_desk_ok.jpg) showing how the =
desktop should look like
(after deiconizing the FvwmButton icon in the top left)
when the configuration file is properly loaded (tested with fvwm =
2.4.18).

Thank you for your help

Best regards

	Frank

Please try to ask your question in the body.

This is a feature. Currently there is no way for the menu event loop to
process X events (and module traffic too). The application is started,
it is just not mapped until you leave the menu.

Mikhael.

Does anyone have any ideas? I feel like I have tried everything.

Also, moving windows works just fine. They won't move off of the
Screen. If I move a window that is partially off the screen, it
will jump to be completely on the screen.

Thanks,
Garron

Some of the windows in our app are set up to open with their
top left corner where the mouse pointer is. If the mouse pointer
is next to the right or bottom of the screen, the windows are
opening up partially off the screen. Is there a Style that can
be set to ensure the windows will be placed completely on the
screen?

Thanks,

I can't think of anything short of using FvwmEvent to execute a
script that corrects the window position if it's off screen.

If you have control over what the application does, why don't you
modify the application code.  Okay, it does not know the size of
the decorations beforehand, but it could at least make sure that
the window stays almost on screen.

FvwmEvent is a good suggestion. I have figured out how to create =
functions
to move a window to the screen edge, but is there a way to check where =
the
window is and run the appropriate command based on its location?=20

I have figured out some functions, but I don't know how to implement
MoveWindowOnScreen. Can someone give me advice?


Module FvwmEvent

*FVWMEvent: PassID
*FVWMEvent: add_window MoveWindowOnScreen

AddToFunc MoveToTop
+ I Move keep 0

AddToFunc MoveToBottom
+ I Move keep -0

AddToFunc MoveToLeft
+ I Move 0 keep

AddToFunc MoveToRight
+ I Move -0 keep

AddToFunc MoveWindowOnScreen
# if window is off to left
#	MoveToLeft
# if window is off to right
#	MoveToRight
# if window is off to top
#	MoveToTop
# if window is off to bottom
#	MoveToBottom



Thanks,

If you have control over what the application does, why don't you modify =
the=20
application code.  Okay, it does not know the size of the decorations =
beforehand,=20
but it could at least make sure that the window stays almost on screen.

Hi,

I'm trying to define a function for shading a window and sorting the
shaded windows in the current page according to their width. For
this I write the width and the windowId of each shaded window into a
temporary file and I process it with a small python script. The
result is something like

DestroyFunc ShadeWindowAndSort
AddToFunc ShadeWindowAndSort
+ I Current WindowShade
+ I SortShadedWindows

DestroyFunc SortShadedWindows
AddToFunc SortShadedWindows
+ I All (CurrentPage, Shaded, !Sticky) PipeRead 'echo $[w.width] $[w.id] >> .fvwm/shadedWindows'
+ I PipeRead '.fvwm/sortShadedWindows.py'
+ I PipeRead 'rm -f .fvwm/shadedWindows'

(I use PipeRead instead of Exec in the 1st and 3rd lines for
synchronizing). If I call SortShadedWindows from the Console it all
works flawlessly, but when called from ShadeWindowAndSort it only
moves the current window. By looking into .fvwm/shadedWindows I see
that all the entries have the windowId (and width) of the current
window. As I understand the 'All (...)' command this shouldn't be
the case, or am I doing something wrong? (fvwm version is 2.5.10)

Thank you for your help!!

The quoting is incorrect.  Variables are expanded every time a
command is run (except if it is the "AddTo..." or "+" command).
It seems you are running the ShadeWindowAndSort function in a
window context, for example with

  Current ShadeWindowAndSort

Now, this processes the command "All ( ... echo $[w.width] ..."
Variables are expanded. Because a context window is currently
defined, $[w.width] and $[w.id] are expanded, and the values of
the *current* window are inserted.

Finally, the command "Piperead 'echo <current width> <current id> >> ...'"
is run, which is what you see.  Note that the function does work
if it's run without a context window.  In this case, the
$[w.width] is not expanded before the All command.

To make it short, replace "$[w.width] $[w.id]" with
"$$$[w.width] $$$[w.id]" and the function works fine.

HI i am pretty new to installing x windows. 
I am using FVWM version 1 and want to update to
current stable version. 

Well i run the following script. I have write
permissions to "/usr/users/a14fs/cmlonkar/" only

"./configure --enable-debug-msg --help
--prefix=/usr/users/a14fs/cmlonkar/"

Shoudnt --prefix take care of path ? I get the
following error msg:-

"interpreter "/bin/sh" not found
file link resolves to "usr/bin/sh"
./configure: Command not found."

Obviously some script is looking in that path to
write. Which file will have the 'link' that i need to
resolve.

Thanks,
Mani !

What is your $SHELL set to? If it is bash, /bin/sh should be a
symlink to it, normally.

You don't need --enable-debug-msg.
--help prints the help, don't specify it.

It seems that your system is a bit broken regarding /bin/sh,
make it (or ask your sysadmin) to resymlink it to the real shell.

Alternativelly, you may do "bash configure --prefix=...". But if your
system can't run standard shell scripts, then you will have many problems
including boot problems, I guess.

FvwmTaskBar can't swallow FvwmPager.

FvwmButtons can swallow FvwmIconMan and FvwmPager. You can find some
configs on the web doing this (fvwm-themes is one of them).

It may be time consuming to learn and fix 30MB or 140KB of complex
configurations, you should not expect this.

Please make a minimal config file (10-20 lines) showing the problem with
"fvwm -f my-minimal-config". It is possible you will be able to reproduce
this problem without any images and even fix it yourself once you nail it.

> Is there a possibility to upload this package to a dedicated FTP server ?

I think you may find a free web hosting, so you could post just urls of
images and simple configs to the mailing list. Large tarballs are not
the best thing to attach.

Mikhael.

I think that it would be something like this, but the expressions don't
evaluate and I'm not sure that this is proper syntax.

AddToFunc MoveWindowOnScreen
+ I WindowId $0 ($[w.x] < 0) MoveToLeft
+ I WindowId $0 (($[w.x] + $[w.width]) > $[vp.width]) MoveToRight
+ I WindowId $0 ($[w.y] < 0) MoveToTop
+ I WindowId $0 (($[w.y] + $[w.height]) > $[vp.height]) MoveToBottom

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

FvwmEvent is a good suggestion. I have figured out how to create =
functions
to move a window to the screen edge, but is there a way to check where =
the
window is and run the appropriate command based on its location?=20

I have figured out some functions, but I don't know how to implement
MoveWindowOnScreen. Can someone give me advice?


Module FvwmEvent

*FVWMEvent: PassID
*FVWMEvent: add_window MoveWindowOnScreen

AddToFunc MoveToTop
+ I Move keep 0

AddToFunc MoveToBottom
+ I Move keep -0

AddToFunc MoveToLeft
+ I Move 0 keep

AddToFunc MoveToRight
+ I Move -0 keep

AddToFunc MoveWindowOnScreen
# if window is off to left
#	MoveToLeft
# if window is off to right
#	MoveToRight
# if window is off to top
#	MoveToTop
# if window is off to bottom
#	MoveToBottom

If you have control over what the application does, why don't you modify =

application code.  Okay, it does not know the size of the decorations =

but it could at least make sure that the window stays almost on screen.

hi,
i got problems setting geometry on my pager. This is my config:

*FvwmPager: Geometry 71x53+0-0
*FvwmPager: Font none
*FvwmPager: Balloons
*FvwmPager: BalloonColorset * 9
*FvwmPager: HilightColorset * 9
*FvwmPager: WindowColorsets * 10
*FvwmPager: Window3DBorders
*FvwmPager: UseSkipList
*FvwmPager: BalloonFont "xft:Sans:medium:pixelsize=10:minspace=True"
*FvwmPager: NoSeparators
*FvwmPager: MiniIcons
*FvwmPager: ShapeLabels
*FvwmPager: Colorset * 10

i always get the same size when the pager starts up. There is no other
geometry tag in the config files. DeskTopScale is not set.

regards Andi

are you shure, this is for your version of FvwmPager ?
look at FvwmPager(1)

for fvwm 2.2.5, for example, you'd have to use this:
*FvwmPagerGeometry geometry

for fvwm 2.5.10, your config should work..

2.2.x is not supported. The colon-space syntax works since 2.3.x and this
is the only valid syntax guaranteed to continue to work in the future.

Returning to the original problem. Is it possible you call a pager alias,
like "FvwmPager MyPager"? To see it works, start FvwmConsole and type:

  *FvwmPager: Geometry 71x53+0-0
  FvwmPager

Mikhael.

Please double check that you are running the new executable (is
your ModulePath set correctly?).  If that doesn't solve the
problem, post a small config that shows the problem to the mailing
list.

Hi all,

I want to configure my Fvwm95 desk to taste. I am reading thru the man page and
I have a couple of questions:

1. Is the FvwmTaskBar just an instance of the FvwmButtons?

2. How could I have a "drawer" or sub-panel (like Afterstep's) pop up when I do
some action on a window iconified into the FvwmTaskBar? What I'm driving after
is to have one of those miniturized windows a la this shot: 

http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/Nuno_Alexandre-1600x1200/screenshot.jpg

pop up when I right click an icon in the FvwmTaskBar.

I'd post my fvwm2rc, but it's pretty much stock. I'll do so if it helps.


Thanks
George.

Hey there!
I've got fvwm 2.5.10, and starting the pager with FvwmConsole doesn't
make it better. Same problem.

help...)

I think that it would be something like this, but the expressions don't
evaluate and I'm not sure that this is proper syntax.

AddToFunc MoveWindowOnScreen
+ I WindowId $0 ($[w.x] < 0) MoveToLeft
+ I WindowId $0 (($[w.x] + $[w.width]) > $[vp.width]) MoveToRight
+ I WindowId $0 ($[w.y] < 0) MoveToTop
+ I WindowId $0 (($[w.y] + $[w.height]) > $[vp.height]) MoveToBottom

FvwmEvent is a good suggestion. I have figured out how to create =
functions
to move a window to the screen edge, but is there a way to check where =
the
window is and run the appropriate command based on its location?=20

I have figured out some functions, but I don't know how to implement
MoveWindowOnScreen. Can someone give me advice?


Module FvwmEvent

*FVWMEvent: PassID
*FVWMEvent: add_window MoveWindowOnScreen

AddToFunc MoveToTop

AddToFunc MoveToBottom
+ I Move keep -0

AddToFunc MoveToLeft

AddToFunc MoveToRight

AddToFunc MoveWindowOnScreen

If you have control over what the application does, why don't you modify =

application code.  Okay, it does not know the size of the decorations =

but it could at least make sure that the window stays almost on screen.

Hi all,
I just compiled 2.5.10 (under SuSE 9.1) and noticed two things:

1. png Icons appear to work only in Menus, but not in FvwmButtons. 
2. No matter which DeskTopSize I set, I always get a 2x2 FvwmPager matrix.

Are these bugs or is it just my dumbness? The configuration I use works
well in 2.4.18.

Regards,
Bernd

Tried your suggestion but it won't work. The Location is correct but the
size is the same....

No ModulePath.

What is an appropriate command to put in .fvwm2rc so
as to cause an application to appear in iconified
form?

For example:
in AddToFunc StartFunction I have a line
+ I Exec exmh -xrm "*Page:0 0 0"

or in the root menu there are lines like this:

DestroyMenu MenuFvwmRoot
AddToMenu MenuFvwmRoot  "Root Menu"    Title

+                "&N. Network Control" Exec exec neat-control

How could I cause the exmh and the neat-control to first appear
in iconified form?

Thanks,

Hi!

I'd like to have the main menu pop-up as a fixed and never disappearing
menu on my side panel. How can I specify a static position in a layer for
the menu? And how to make it show up at start and keep on appearing, no
matter what and where I click on?

thanks for your help,
loki

hi all,

i am using a slightly modified version of taviso's fvwmrc (thanks it
is awesome !).

let me first describe the setting:
i have an FvwmButtons module, that has a bunch of commonly used icons
/ swallowed pager etc. i can click on the edge of the FvwmButtons
module which will 'slide' it into the right screen edge.

the problem:
when maximizing the windows, the EwmhBaseStruts is configured so that
maximized windows don't cover the buttons module. this is all
fine-n-dandy when FvwmButtons is visible. when it is not (which is
most of the time), maximizing the windows doesn't occupy the whole
screen.

is there a way to dynamically adjust the parameters of EwmhBaseStruts,
do behave correctly in _both_ the cases (as described above).

thank you
kind regards
anupam

ps: i don't know why, but i keep trying out different windowmanagers,
and keep coming back to fvwm !

Assuming your menu has the name MenuPanel:

  Style MenuPanel UsePPosition, layer <target layer>
  Menu MenuPanel root 0p 0p

Then move the mouse over the menu and press backspace.

At the moment, menus can be torn off only interactively.  In
2.5.11 there will be the option TearOffImmediately for the menu
and popup commands:

  Menu MenuPanel root 0p 0p tearoffimmediately

You don't describe in detail what you are doing with FvwmButtons,
so I have to guess your configuration looks like this.

  addtofunc somefunction
  + C thiswindow (FvwmButtons) windowshade e
  + C testrc (nomatch) windowshade toggle
  ...

  mouse 1 sf a somefunction

> is there a way to dynamically adjust the parameters of EwmhBaseStruts,

Make a function that sets the EwmhBaseStruts style before sliding
the button bar:

  addtofunc somefunction
  + C thiswindow (FvwmButtons) shadefvwmbuttons
  + C testrc (nomatch) windowshade toggle
  ...

  addtofunc shadefvwmbuttons
  + I thiswindow (shaded) Style * EwmhBaseStruts <unshaded settings>
  + I thiswindow (!shaded) Style * EwmhBaseStruts <shaded settings>
  + I windowshade e

  mouse 1 sf a somefunction

Note that the styles are activated only after the function has
completed and fvwm is idle.  That means, if another function
maximizes (e.g. because you pressed mouse buttons on hold), it
will assume the old struts.  This is usually very rare and not a
problem.  If it is, add

  + I UpdateStyles

at the end of the shadefvwmbuttons function.

Maybe because it's better? ;-)

Please double check whether fvwm runs fine without a configuration
file.  Start fvwm with the command

  fvwm -f /dev/null

e.g. from $HOME/.xinitrc.  Start FvwmConsole from the root menu,
then type

  *FvwmPager: Geometry 71x53+0-0
  FvwmPager

This should work.  If it doesn't, check the file
ConfigFvwmDefaults (may be installed in /usr/local/share/fvwm).
This file should not be modified, but if it is it may contain
conflicting settings.

If the pager comes up fine, check all your config files for
settings that override the pager geometry.

You may also add=20

  DestroyMofuleConfig FvwmPager*

before the pager configuration to make sure you're not inheriting
other settings.

> No ModulePath.

Ciao

Hi fvwm people,

I like to have several open xterms scattered across my sixteen desktop 
pages on startup. I'd like to do this through a "Style" setting in my 
fvwm2rc rather than using X geometry specification because it's more 
robust against screen resolution changes, and it seems to be more the fvwm 
way. However, I can only use one style setting per application, meaning 
that all my xterms open on top of one another. How can this be changed?

Thanks,
--Daniel

Perhaps you could give the xterms unique names?

Hello list,

my scheme lib for fvwm develops more and more into a usable tool ... as
next step i wanted to implement Send_WindowList. But i'm not sure how
is the exact format of the packages send after the command. As i have
at least minimal knowledge of C, i usually take a look at perllib but
this time i do not found aynthing there either... Maybe someone can
point me in the right direction?

Mario

In my .fvwm2rc I have switched to using xft fonts.
So I have used an alias like this:

"xft:Sans:Medium:Roman:size=10:encoding=iso10646-1"

When looking in gunchar and choosing "Sans" I can see quite a lot of 
characters, and the "real" fonts they come from.
But in Fvwm it seems only 1 font is really used.
Isn't font aliases handled by Xft? I thought the "Sans" would refer to a 
specific style, and Xft would choose best fit fonts for each character.

Have I missed something, or is there a mistake in my configuration?

I wanted similar functionality with aterm, so I hope the same answer
applies.

I wanted a transparent, sticky aterm to sit on my desktop. When creating
the aterm, I specify "-title iterm". I then have a style "iterm" (in
addition to my style "aterm") that I changed certain settings to get
this behavior. That way, it behaves differently than my aterm instances.

The easiest way to understand what Send_WindowList does is to run
FvwmGtkDebug (install gtk-perl if you don't have it), then press
"Start" and "Send_WindowList" buttons.

You may do this with "FvwmDebug -sw --log /tmp/file" too. Unfortunately
it has a typo in the long option name, --semd-windowlist.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Ah, i see, my problem was that i haven't understand that
Send_WindoeList will just send normal package types... great!

But there still seems to be a problem. I get number of packages types
that does not exist, for example 6291526. Maybe i have problem with
syncronization ... can i be sure that 0xffffffff is *only* send when a
package starts? I check here if the first long integer from input is
4294967295 and then read the rest?

Hi there!

   I'm using FVWM 2.5.10 anf X.org from CVS. Unfotunately something is=20
wrong with titlebar. Look at the title string and buttons on the right si=
de.

With translucent titlebar, left justified title:
http://www.lynucs.org/index.php?screen_type=3D1&screen_id=3D1315393376412=
4ec4339b28&m=3Dscreen

With PNGs on titlebar, centered title:
http://witryna.fucio.pl/user120/published/badtitle.jpg

Is somewhere patch for this or this is not FVWM guilty?

Thanks for your attention

my only problem seems to be stupidity... :( I have forgotten that the
length of the package is *inclusive* the header ...=20

Works now! Thanks to everyone for ideas...

Hello list,
1.  I wonder how to do the same as in MS Windows Win-D to show
	desktop. And press the combo again will restore to the previous
	state.

2.  I found that lots of Window titles in FVWM'S WindowList is different
from KDE/GNOME's taskbar. Those titles in FVWM's taskbar are usually
not that friendly, or uneasy to recognize. any way to fix that?

Thanks.

I'm trying to setup my keyboard so I can move applications between
windows on my desktop, similar to Meta-Shift arrows in Gnome. The idea
is that I want to be able to press Meta-Shift and use the arrow keys to
move an application between windows. Any ideas?

Thanks,

- Jay

Hello,

I'm interested at making a screenshot of all my desktops and pages,
(my pager is 10x7x4)
for remembering what i was working on if a crash occur.
(i'm always hitting the 256 clients limit for X)

do you know any soft or way to do that ?

import (from image magic) can only take the displayed screen.

or would there be a fvwm script to screenshot pages,  page by page ?

any idea on how i could do that ?

thanks

I just configured kind of this feature this weekend :)

I used (hjkl) as in vim. But bellow I changed to the keys you intend to
use.

The bindings bellow permits you to send (and follow) windows through
'pages' and 'desktops'.


--- 8< ---

# key bindings

# moving to the 'next' (n) or 'previous' (p) desktop,
# using n, p and Meta-Shift

Key p       A MS funcSendAndGoToDesk -1 0 2
Key n       A MS funcSendAndGoToDesk +1 0 2


# moving left,up,right,down through the pages,
# using the arrow keys with Meta-Shift

Key left    A MS funcSendAndGoToPage -1p  0p
Key up      A MS funcSendAndGoToPage  0p -1p
Key right   A MS funcSendAndGoToPage +1p  0p
Key down    A MS funcSendAndGoToPage  0p +1p


# functions

destroyFunc funcSendAndGoToDesk
addToFunc   funcSendAndGoToDesk
+ I moveToDesk $0 $1 $2
+ I goToDesk   $0 $1 $2

destroyFunc funcSendAndGoToPage
addToFunc   funcSendAndGoToPage
+ I moveToPage $0 $1
+ I goToPage   $0 $1

--- 8< ---

The only problem I see is that when we 'change desktops', we loose the
focus on the window we're moving. We can alt-tab to regain focus.

Besides this problem, these bindings function well.

Hello,

in current FVWM code (cvs), when setting EWMH_FULLSCREEN, the window 
size constraints are disabled only during the transition to fullscreen 
in fvwm code itself. However, when one touches the window after setting 
the fullscreen mode, the window gets mis-resized. This is an issue for 
example for mplayer fullscreen code, which calls XMapRaised and 
XRaiseWindow after setting the fullscreen hint. This gives the window 
completely bogus dimensions. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to disable 
the constraints all the time the fullscreen mode is set?

I would be interested to know too. Currently I use gimp for screenshots,
but AFAIK gimp will also only take a shot of the current page.

Hello,
   How does one go about destroying / closing / killing a form from
another form?  I basically need to kill a list of forms upon execution
of another form.  I have searched quite a bit and read the FVWMForm
man page in great depth a few times, but I still know not how to achieve
the functionality I am looking for.  Thanks for any and all help.

	Cheers,
	  Nicholas Harknett

I am not sure whether you want to get 280 images of resolution 1000x1000,
or 10 images 7000x4000. Or maybe one 7000x40000 image weighting 1GB. :)
All these options do not seem very usable.

I don't think X has a way to access the image of unvisible windows.
In short, the unvisible virtual pages simply do not exist, they should
yet to be formed by X, fvwm and applications.

But you may create an fvwm function that does what you want, like:

  GotoDesk 0
  PipeRead `import -window root /tmp/desktop-0.png >/dev/null`
  GotoDesk 1
  PipeRead `import -window root /tmp/desktop-1.png >/dev/null`
  GotoDesk 2
  PipeRead `import -window root /tmp/desktop-2.png >/dev/null`
  GotoDesk 3
  PipeRead `import -window root /tmp/desktop-3.png >/dev/null`

If you have 10 desks of 7x4 pages, you will need to repeat GotoDeskAndPage
and import 280 times. It may take about 15 minutes or more to create all
screenshots. Note, that your fvwm will be unfunctional during this time.

Regards,
Mikhael.

I suppose you know how to bind an fvwm action. Then something like:

  All (FvwmForm) ThisWindow (!FvwmForm-TheMainForm) Close

or maybe have a function that closes individual windows:

  AddToFunc CloseMyForms
  + I Next (FvwmForm-Secondary) Close
  + I Next (...) Close

If you think an error message is not produced in some cases, please post
the config line demonstrating this. Always specify your fvwm version.

If you install fvwm-themes 0.7.0, it has such feature in the panel of the
RedmondXP theme. It plays with State flag to be able to restore the
original state of windows.

Please show examples of such difference. There are at least 4 names that
may be used to identify the window, name (title name), icon name, class
and resource. Apply FvwmIdent or xprop on your window to see its names.

You can pass UseIconName argument to WindowList to show icon names
instead of title names, but in most of applications these are the same.
In some modules, like FvwmIconMan, FvwmPager and FvwmWindowMenu, you may
configure any combination of the 4 window names, see their man pages and
"format" options.

Mikhael.

Perhaps it works to use Xnest to start one virtual X-Server for each 
page. I do not know if it works to make fvwm aware of them all, maybe 
with xinerama-functionality or something? Then you perhaps can take 
screenshots of all pages without changing to them. (I guess you need a 
lot of RAM for this configuration.)

The problem is, that those configs are realy HUGE. Is there an option
to disable error messages? My fvwm version is the latest unstable
2.5.10.

The exact problem is with FvwmButtons,
*FvwmBottomBar: (20x1, Padding 3 4, Left, \
    Icon sound.xpm, Action "Exec exec gnome-volume-control")
The icon sound.xpm doesn't exist and i expected the error message
above.

Thanks,

No. There are only options documented in the man pages.

This means that FvwmButtons silently ignores the missing image problem.
You (or someone else) are welcome to provide a patch for this case.

I'd like to use key strokes to change my window focus.  Similar to window=

en groping around the doc and this seems possible, but I cannot find how =
to do it.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did you mean XResizeWindow?  Following a fullscreen request with a
resize request is odd.

I think there are two reasonable solutions when a window that is
in fullscreen mode is resized (either by the application or by the
user):

 1) Force the window back to normal mode.

or

 2) Ignore the resize request.

I tend to favour solution (1) here.

Ciao

I am not sure what is exactly the problem, but here are some bindings
copy/pasted from fvwm-themes (with minor modifications):

  AddToFunc   SelectWindow

  + I Raise
  + I WarpToWindow 50 50

  Key Tab         A       CM      Prev FuncFvwmSelectWindow
  Key Tab         A       SCM     Next FuncFvwmSelectWindow
  Key Prior       A       M       Prev FuncFvwmSelectWindow
  Key Next        A       M       Next FuncFvwmSelectWindow

Use 'xev' and 'xmodmap' utilities to find the names of the pressed keys
and info about modifiers.

No, I mean XRaiseWindow. And any of XRaiseWindow or XMapRaised causes 
the constraints kick in. In MPlayer's case, the window has the aspect 
ratio constraint, which makes the window expand horizontally.

Ah I see.  This happens only with the latest mplayer code, not
with the code I fetched from CVS in June.

It's a very old bug in fvwm that never bothered anyone until now.
When fvwm gets a ConfigureRequest, it recalculates the window
dimensions, even if it was a restack request, not a move/resize
request.  I have fixed that in cvs.

I can't find the right options for enable/disable error messages in man

Not exactly, the same line in different config produces an error msg ;).

As I said, if such option is not in the man page, it does not exist.
The intended operation is to always print missing-image errors. "Silent"
prefix may suppress some kind of errors, but not this one.

The error you posted is from the colorset code, not FvwmButtons, so the
line is definitelly different. Something like: Colorset Pixmap sound.xpm.

I seeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, the first config, that writes an error is
complainig about missing sound.xpm, because it misses it at different

Hello!

I am using fvwm2-2.5.9 on SuSE 9.1. I need to start fvwm2 and after that 
one java application on full screen. My .fvwm2rc looks like this:
...
fvwm2 &
javaapp
...
Trouble is that I have to double-click on border of java application 
window to get it resized on full screen. Is it possible that fvwm2 do it 
automatically, without mouse clicking? I've tried examples from faq 3.18 
but it didn't help.

Thanks,
Vlado

I currently have my keys set up such that Ctrl+Meta+<arrow> moves to
another page in the pager (I apologize if I'm using the wrong
terminology). The mappings are defined as follows:

Key Left   A CM Scroll -100 +0
Key Right  A CM Scroll +100 +0
Key Up     A CM Scroll +0 -100
Key Down   A CM Scroll +0 +100

What I want to do is to add the ability to cycle back around the pager.
That is, if the current page is at the left edge of the pager, the next
time I press C-M-Left, the current page would cycle to the right most
edge, but stay in the same row. I want similar functionality for
vertical movement as well.

For the record, I'm using 2.5.10 and my DeskTopSize is 4x3.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

- Jay

Depending on which kind of wrapping you want, use either this:

  Key Down   A CM Scroll +0 +100000
  Key Up     A CM Scroll +0 -100000
  Key Right  A CM Scroll +100000 +0
  Key Left   A CM Scroll -100000 +0

or this:

  Key Down   A CM Scroll +400000 +0
  Key Up     A CM Scroll -400000 +0
  Key Right  A CM Scroll +0 +300000
  Key Left   A CM Scroll +0 -300000

I think there is a small bug with negative offsets in the last examples.
It is probably a one line patch, feel free to send a fix.

Regards,
Mikhael.

works great.

takes 1 mins for 10x7 on one desk.
however, there is desks where there is nothing ;
is there a fvwm way to know that ? so that i don't take 
empty and useless screenshots.

thanks

Hello,
  Does anybody know how I can do the following?  In an FvwmScript, which
I have already wrote, I want create an if statement to check the status
of a window.  For example, I would like to check whether it is iconified, focused, brought forward (etc.)  I know how to use these properties as 
conditions in an All command or the likes, but I was wondering how to 
refer to these properties and how to compare them to a window name, in an FvwmScript.
  The reason I am trying to do this, is I would like, when I click on a 
button, I would like to check the status of a window with a certain name,
and then if it is iconified, I would like to DeIconify it and fbring it 
forward and focus it.  If it does not exist, run a command, and if it does
exist and is not iconified, iconify it.  
  I hope somebody can just help me to get started with a conditional check
on the status, as I belive I can do the rest with little to no trouble.

	Cheers,
	  Nick Harknett

Mikhael -

Thanks for the quick reply. The version with 100000 wasn't quite the
behavior I was looking for, but a start in the right direction. When at
the right most edge, another invocation to C-M-Right moved it to the
left edge, but down a row as well.

The second version I had seen online somewhere, but that produced pretty
much completely sporadic results. I couldn't quite see a pattern in
where the focus went, it jumped around significantly.

Any other ideas?

Thanks,

- Jay

  Key Up     A CM Scroll +0 -100000
  Key Right  A CM Scroll +100000 +0
  Key Left   A CM Scroll -100000 +0

or this:

  Key Down   A CM Scroll +400000 +0
  Key Up     A CM Scroll -400000 +0
  Key Right  A CM Scroll +0 +300000
  Key Left   A CM Scroll +0 -300000

I think there is a small bug with negative offsets in the last examples.
It is probably a one line patch, feel free to send a fix.

Regards,
Mikhael.

Try this, might be a bit faster:

AddToFunc Screenshot I PipeRead `for ((x=0;x<$[desk.pagesx];x++)); do \
	for ((y=0;y<$[desk.pagesy];y++)); \
		do echo GotoPage ${x} ${y}; \

	$[desk.pagesx]x$[desk.pagesy] $[FVWM_USERDIR]/page_*_*.xwd \
	png:$[HOME]/screenshot.png; rm -f $[FVWM_USERDIR]/page_*_*.xwd`

(makes a screenshot.png in your home dir)

If I understand you correctly, this has nothing to do with FvwmScript.
Create a function or several sub-functions (if needed) to do the work.
Then bind it to a titlebar button, or maybe FvwmScript/FvwmForm action.

The function may do something like this in 2.5.x:

  + I Next (Mozilla) Nop
  + I TestRc (!Match) Exec mozilla
  + I TestRc (Match) ThisWindow (Iconified) Iconify off
  + I TestRc (!Match) Iconify on

Or any other if-else construction. You get the idea.

Regards,
Mikhael.

X-Spam-Score: -4.7 (----)

X-Majordomo: 1.94.jlt7

Hello All,

I've taken an EdgeCommand example from fvwm's man page and tried to
modify it so that the FvwmButtons window (located along the bottom part
of the screen) gets raised when the cursor hits the bottom edge of the
screen, and gets iconified when the cursor leaves the FvwmButtons window.
Unfortunately due to my limited experience with fvwm's config I could
not do that.   I'd appreciate if the gurus on the list could help me out.
Here is what I wrote:

		Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus

                   # Set thickness of the edge of the screen to 1
                   EdgeThickness 1

                   # Give focus to FvwmButtons if the mouse
                   # hits bottom edge
                   EdgeCommand Bottom Next (FvwmButtons) Focus

                   Module FvwmButtons
                   Module FvwmAuto 100 \
                        "Silent AutoRaiseFunction" \
                        "Silent AutoLowerFunction"

                   DestroyFunc AutoLowerFunction
                   AddToFunc AutoLowerFunction
                   + I Current (!FvwmButtons) \
                        All (FvwmButtons) Iconify

                   # If FvwmButtons has focus when calling \
                   # this function raise it
                   DestroyFunc AutoRaiseFunction
                   AddToFunc AutoRaiseFunction
                   + I Current (FvwmButtons) Raise

I want FvwmButtons disappear completely when the mouse leaves FvwmButtons
window, regardless whether the pointer goes into the root area or to
another window.  With the setup above, FvwmButtons window disappears and
appears again during swiching of the desks, in a seemingly random fashion.

I currently use another example from FAQ to make FvwmButtons shade or
unshade (I've put the relevant .fvwm2rc lines below the signature),
but this setup leaves an annoying piece of FvwmButtons at the bottom of
the screen.

Many thanks!

I don't quite understand what you are trying to do.  What is the
initial size of the window, and how do you want it (size, with or
without borders, ...)?

Hello,

I am trying to use FvwmButtons (Fvwm 2.5.10) as some sort of systray. That
is, I'm trying to get it to swallow small docklet windows some
applications provide (e.g. the jabber client psi). I wrote a small example
configuration for that matter:

################## FvwmButtons button-bar ################################
KillModule FvwmButtons
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons: *
*FvwmButtons: Geometry 66x22-1+296
*FvwmButtons: Back #484048
*FvwmButtons: Fore steelblue
*FvwmButtons: Rows 1
*FvwmButtons: Columns 3
*FvwmButtons: BoxSize smart
*FvwmButtons: (1x1, Swallow(NoClose, NoOld, Kill) "psidock")

Module FvwmButtons
##########################################################################

When I (re)start Fvwm, everything works fine: FvwmButtons appears, and as
soon as I start psi, the docklet gets swallowed. However, when I close psi
and restart it later, the docklet will not get swallowed again, but
instead float somewhere on the screen, like any other window. Is that a
known limitation I can only avoid by not closing psi after I opened it for
the first time, or am I missing something?=20

Many Thanks,

Florian

I've added:
  +      "I"     Exec javaapp
in 'AddToFunc InitFunction' section and line:
Style * Layer 10, NoHandles,NoTitle,StaysOnTop,StaysOnTop,BorderWidth 0
in general setup section.
Now my java application starts on full screen window, users
can't move it, resize it and that is what I've wanted.
Is there some better solution?

Regards,
Vlado

I have the same problem with FvwmScripts in FvwmButtons. It's swallowed on
restart but not on the first start. 
It's possible the size is to small, but why does it work on a
restart?

Note that the (No)Kill setting has no effect when NoClose is used.

It's a limitation nobody thought of.  I'll add an option
SwallowNew that is like NoRespawn, but if a matching window
appears on its own, the new window is swallowed.

Actually, this is a completely different problem.

There are many subtle things that can go wrong.  If you post your
FvwmButtons configuration I can take a look at it.

This is the best version of the function I managed to write:

--
Style FvwmButtons MouseFocus

# Set thickness of the edge of the screen to 1
EdgeThickness 1

EdgeCommand Bottom Next (FvwmButtons) Focus
Style FvwmButtons CirculateHit, MouseFocus

Module FvwmButtons
Module FvwmAuto 100 "Silent AutoRaiseFunction"

DestroyFunc AutoLowerFunction
AddToFunc AutoLowerFunction
+ I ThisWindow (FvwmButtons) Iconify on

# If FvwmButtons has focus when calling this function raise it
DestroyFunc AutoRaiseFunction
AddToFunc AutoRaiseFunction
+ I All (!Iconic, !Focused, FvwmButtons) Iconify on
+ I Current (Iconic, FvwmButtons) Iconify off
+ I Current (FvwmButtons) Raise
--

Unfortunately, it does not hide the the buttons window when the
pointer moves to the root window.  While this works fine with the
shading version from the FAQ, it's nigh impossible to do right
with the iconifying version.  If this is too annoying for you, try
shading to a corner instead of the whole bottom edge.

Ciao

I have a mouse binding for closing windows,
	Mouse 1 4M Close
I would like to be able to close windows by clicking on the corresponding 
button in IconMan, so I did this:
	Style "FvwmIconMan" !Closable
	*FvwmIconMan: *action	Mouse	1	4M	sendcommand Close
It seems like when I click on a button with this binding, fvwm just sends 
it to IconMan, not the button.  Before I put the !Closable in, IconMan 
would close.  This binding works fine, because it's not defined anywhere 
else:
	*FvwmIconMan: *action	Mouse	3	4M	sendcommand Close

However, I would like to have only Mouse 1 4M close windows.  Is there a 
way to get around this?

Thanks,
jpkotta
